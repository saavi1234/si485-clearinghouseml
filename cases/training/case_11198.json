    "summary": "<p>On November 8, 2007, 20 named plaintiffs--criminal defendants with cases pending in New York state courts--filed this class action lawsuit in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in Albany County. The plaintiffs sued the State under 42 U.S.C. §1983 for violations of the Sixth and the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and Article 1, Section 6 of the New York Constitution. Represented by the New York Civil Liberties Union and private counsel, plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to ensure meaningful and effective representation for indigent defendants.</p><p>The plaintiffs claimed that New York's persistent failure to guarantee effective legal services for indigent defendants in five New York counties was a violation of their right to counsel. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the State's system effectively denied indigents their right to counsel because of its (1) failure to provide representation to some defendants at critical stages of their cases; (2) eligibility standards that excluded indigent people from counsel; (3) lack of attorney-client consultation and communication; (4) insufficient hiring criteria, performance standards, and trainings and supervisory controls; (5) insufficient resources for investigations and expert witnesses; (6) lack of independence from political, prosecutorial, and judicial authorities; and (7) inadequate resources and compensation for public defenders as compared with prosecutors.</p><p>On August 12, 2008, Judge Eugene Devine denied the defendants' Motion to Dismiss. The defendants appealed to the state intermediate appellate court (the Supreme Court, Appellate Division). In July 2009, Judge Michael Kavanagh overruled the lower court and granted the defendants' Motion to Dismiss. 66 A.D.3d 84. He held that the plaintiffs could only bring retrospective cases charging a denial of counsel. Therefore, plaintiffs would have to wait for conviction before claiming insufficient counsel.  The plaintiffs then appealed to New York's highest court, the New York Court of Appeals.</p><p>On May 6, 2010, Judge Jonathan Lippman found for the plaintiffs, ruling that (1) the issue of whether the State of New York was meeting its constitutional obligation under Gideon v. Wainwright (372 U.S. 335) was ripe for review, the plaintiffs' preconviction status notwithstanding. Judge Lippman also found that (2) the issue of the state's compliance with the Gideon requirement to provide indigent people with lawyers was not an issue best left to the legislature, and could be considered and ordered by the Courts. 930 N.E.2d 217. The case was remanded to the trial court (New York Supreme Court).</p><p>Meanwhile, in 2010, the New York legislature created the Office of Indigent Legal Services (ILS) to gather information, make recommendations, and distribute state funds to improve legal services.</p><p>On January 6, 2011, Judge Karen Peters, writing for the Supreme Court, Appellate Division, certified the plaintiffs' class and remanded the case to the Supreme Court for discovery. 81 A.D.3d 69. Class certification had previously been denied in July 2009 by the Supreme Court.  </p><p>On September 1, 2014, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a Statement of Interest in the case. Without taking a position on the particular facts, the DOJ provided its opinion on what constitutes a \"constructive\" denial of counsel under the Sixth Amendment. Even where a defense attorney represents indigent defendants, constructive denial of counsel may occur if (1) lawyers for indigent defendants must systematically work under substantial structural limitations, or (2) traditional markers of representation are systematically compromised. The statement provided examples of such conditions including: insufficient resources; excessive caseloads; serious understaffing to public defender offices; and inadequate opportunity for consultation with clients. Such conditions indicate that appointment of counsel is \"superficial,\" and therefore allows a court to step in to correct Sixth Amendment violations.</p><p>The DOJ's statement helped prompt a settlement agreement on October 21, 2014. The settlement required the state to implement significant reforms in the five New York counties specifically named in the complaint. Specifically, the state would (1) guarantee a lawyer at arraignment for every indigent defendant; (2) require ILS to track and report on lawyer caseloads and set appropriate caseload standards for lawyers representing indigent defendants; (3) ensure adequate conditions for attorneys including supervision, training, manageable caseloads and access to investigators, interpreters, and expert witnesses; (4) create eligibility standards so more New York defendants have access to public defense services; and (5) implement monitoring and reporting procedures. The settlement also required the Governor's office to use its best efforts to enact legislation necessary to implement the settlement agreement. Overall, the State was required to apportion $8.5 million to implement the settlement agreement, and $5.5 million for attorney fees. The settlement agreement was set to last for 7.5 years, and was court enforceable, after a pre-court dispute resolution process.</p><p>On June 17, 2016, the New York Assembly passed A10706, requiring states to take financial responsibility for indigent defense. Supporters of the bill claimed that by removing the burden from counties, it would have helped ensure defendants received appropriate counsel. Governor Cuomo vetoed the bill in December 2016. </p><p>In April 2017, New York passed a bill to implement many of the requirements listed in the settlement. While counties will be responsible for covering the expense initially, the State will reimburse counties for these expenses. </p><p>On October 30, 2017, the New York State Office of Indigent Legal Services submitted a report detailing ongoing compliance with the settlement. The report discussed the steps the five counties had taken to implement the Quality Plan and the Counsel at Arraignment Plan. It found significant achievements in implementation and noted that the State had met its funding obligation fully and continued the $2 million each year in Quality Improvement funding beyond the two years the settlement required. </p>",

This civil rights lawsuit is brought to remedy the State of New York’s persistent \nfailure to guarantee meaningful and effective legal representation to indigent people accused of \ncrimes, as required by the New York State Constitution and laws and the United States \nConstitution.   \n2.  New York State was once a leader in guaranteeing the right to counsel to indigent \npeople accused of crimes.  In 1881, more than eighty years before the United States Supreme \nCourt established the right to counsel in felony cases under the federal constitution in Gideon v. \nWainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963), the New York State Legislature adopted section 308 of the \n\nCriminal Procedure Law, directing courts to appoint pro bono counsel for unrepresented felony \ndefendants. \n3.  Sadly today, more than forty years after Gideon, the leadership and humanity \nNew York State showed in the past have eroded badly.  In the last few decades, dozens of \nreports, commissions, newspaper investigations, and lawsuits documented the degree to which \nthose accused of crimes in New York State are denied basic constitutional protections.   \n4.  Most recently, in June of 2006, the New York State Commission on the Future of \nIndigent Defense Services, which was convened by Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye, issued a \ncomprehensive report detailing the crisis in New York’s public defense system.  After careful \nstudy of data from all across the state, the Kaye Commission concluded that “the indigent \ndefense system in New York State is both severely dysfunctional and structurally incapable of \nproviding each poor defendant with the effective legal representation that he or she is guaranteed \nby the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution and laws of the State of New York \n… [and] has resulted in a disparate, inequitable, and ineffective system for securing \nconstitutional guarantees to those too poor to obtain counsel of their own choosing.”1 \n5.  Despite the Kaye Commission’s unequivocal statement that the State is now \nknowingly and systematically violating the fundamental rights of its poorest citizens to \nmeaningful and effective legal representation in criminal cases, more than a year has passed \nwithout any action by the State to remedy the problem.   \n6.  Plaintiffs Kimberly Hurrell-Harring, James Adams, Joseph Briggs, Ricky Lee \nGlover, Richard Love, Jr., Jacqueline Winbrone, Lane Loyzelle, Tosha Steele, Bruce \nWashington, Shawn Chase, Jemar Johnson, Robert Tomberelli, Christopher Yaw, Luther \n                                                 \n1 The Final Report of the New York State Commission on the Future of Indigent Defense is \nattached to this complaint and is thereby incorporated by reference pursuant to CPLR § 3014. \n  2\n\nWoodrow of Booker, Jr., Edward Kaminski, Joy Metzler, Victor Turner, Candace Brookins, \nRandy Habshi, and Ronald McIntyre are among the thousands of defendants currently affected \nby the structural and systemic failings of the public defense system identified by the Kaye \nCommission.  Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit on behalf of themselves and of all indigent persons \nwith criminal felony, misdemeanor, or lesser charges pending in New York state courts in \nOnondaga, Ontario, Schuyler, Suffolk and Washington counties (hereinafter, “the Counties”) \nwho are entitled to rely on the government of New York to provide them with meaningful and \neffective defense counsel.   \n7.  The State of New York’s broken public defense system has deteriorated to the \npoint where it now deprives or threatens to deprive these plaintiffs and the class of indigent \ndefendants they represent of rights guaranteed to them by article I, section 6 of the New York \nState Constitution; sections 170.10, 180.10, 180.80, 190.50, and 210.15(2)(c) of the New York \nCriminal Procedure Law; sections 717 and 722-c of the New York County Law; and the Sixth \nand Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and \ninjunctive relief against the State of New York to prevent violations of plaintiffs’ legal rights and \nto remedy the State’s continuing failure to ensure that plaintiffs and the class they represent \nreceive meaningful and effective legal representation. \n8.  The Constitution and laws of the State of New York and the United States \nConstitution guarantee all persons facing criminal charges the right to counsel, even if they \ncannot afford a lawyer.  It has long been established that the State is obligated to provide public \ndefense counsel to such persons at every critical stage of the criminal justice process.  \n9.  The right to counsel is a right to meaningful and effective assistance of counsel.  \nConstitutionally adequate counsel is counsel that is capable of putting the prosecution’s case to \n  3\n\nmeaningful adversarial testing.  Where, as is the case in New York, public defense counsel do \nnot have the resources and the tools to engage actively and meaningfully in the adversarial \nprocess, courts cannot ensure that their decisions, judgments, verdicts and punishments are \nrendered fairly and accurately. \n10.  The constitutional and statutory obligation to provide indigent defendants with \nmeaningful and effective assistance of counsel rests with the State.  Since 1965, the State has \nabdicated its responsibility to guarantee the right to counsel for indigent persons and has left \neach of its sixty-two counties to establish, fund and administer their own public defense \nprograms, with little or no fiscal and administrative oversight or funding from the State. \n11.  Because of this abdication of responsibility, the public defense systems in the \nCounties suffer from some combination of the following deficiencies, among others: incoherent \nor excessively restrictive client eligibility standards; no written hiring and performance standards \nor meaningful systems for attorney supervision and monitoring; lack of adequate attorney \ntraining; a lack of resources for support staff, appropriate investigations and expert services; no \nattorney caseload or workload standards; an absence of consistent representation of each client \nby one lawyer; a lack of independence from the judiciary, the prosecutorial function, and \npolitical authorities; and inadequate resources and compensation for public defense service \nproviders, especially as compared to their prosecutorial counterparts. \n12.  As a result of these deficiencies, many public defense providers in the Counties \noften fail to: provide representation for indigent defendants at all critical stages of the criminal \njustice process, especially arraignments where bail determinations are made; meet or consult \nwith clients prior to critical stages in their criminal proceedings; investigate adequately the \ncharges against their clients or obtain investigators who can assist with case preparation and \n  4\n\ntestify at trial; employ and consult with experts when necessary; file necessary pre-trial motions; \nor provide meaningful representation at trial and at sentencing. \n13.  The inability of public defense counsel to put the case against their clients to \nmeaningful adversarial testing causes the class of indigent defendants to suffer numerous harms, \nincluding but not limited to: wrongful denial of representation; unnecessary or prolonged pre-\ntrial detention; excessive or inappropriate bail determinations, which have been shown in \nincrease the likelihood of conviction; waiver of meritorious defenses; guilty pleas to \ninappropriate charges; guilty pleas taken without adequate knowledge and awareness of the full, \ncollateral consequences of the pleas; wrongful conviction of crimes; harsher sentences than the \nfacts of the case warrant and few alternatives to incarceration; and waiver of the right to appeal \nand other post-conviction rights. \n14.  This complaint focuses on how the State’s failure to provide funding and fiscal \nand administrative oversight has created a broken public defense system in Onondaga, Ontario, \nSchuyler, Suffolk and Washington Counties, but the failings in those counties and the types of \nharms suffered by the named plaintiffs are by no means limited or unique to the named Counties.  \nThe State’s failure to provide funding or oversight to any of New York’s counties has caused \nsimilar problems throughout the State. \n15.  As a direct result of the State’s refusal to oversee, set standards for, and \nadequately fund public defense, indigent criminal defendants in the Counties and across the state \nface a severe and unacceptably high risk of not receiving meaningful and effective assistance of \ncounsel.  In the words of the Kaye Commission, “New York’s current fragmented system of \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed indigent defense services fails to satisfy the state’s \nconstitutional and statutory obligations to protect the rights of the indigent accused.”  \n  5\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPARTIES………………………………………………………………………………………….8 \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE……………………………………………................................11 \nTHE STATE’S FAILURE TO PROVIDE CONSTITUTIONALLY \nAND LEGALLY ADEQUATE PUBLIC DEFENSE SERVICES……………………………...12 \n \n  The Impact of the Public Defense Crisis on the Plaintiffs……………………………….12 \n  The Right to Counsel in New York State………………………………………………..56 \n  The State’s Abdication of Responsibility to the Counties……………………………….57 \n    The Lack of Enforceable, Statewide Standards………………………………….58 \n    The Lack of State Supervision and Oversight……………………………………59 \n    The Lack of Adequate State Funds for Public Defense Services………………...60 \n  The Kaye Commission on the Future of Indigent Defense’s  \n  Indictment of New York’s Public Defense System……………………………………...61 \n \n  New York State’s Long History of Violating the Right to   \n  Counsel for Indigent Defendants………………………………………………………...63 \n \n  The Statewide Failure to Meet Basic Standards of Constitutional  \n  Legal Representation…………………………………………………………………….67 \n \n    Inadequate Staffing and the Failure to Provide Representation to \n    Indigent Defendants At All Critical Stages…………………………………...…68 \n \n    Incoherent or Excessively Restrictive Financial Eligibility  \n    Standards and Delays in the Appointment of Counsel…………………………..72 \n \n    Lack of Attorney-Client Contact and Communication…………………………..77 \n    Lack of Attorney Hiring Criteria, Performance Standards  \n    and Supervisory Controls………………………………………………………..80 \n \n    Lack of Training…………………………………………………………………83 \n \n    Lack of Support Services and the Failure to Conduct  \n    Investigations and Seek Expert Services…………………………………………85 \n \n  6\n\n \n    Excessive Caseloads and/or Workloads…………………………………………88 \n \n    Lack of Vertical Representation………………………………………………....90 \n    The Lack of Political and Professional Independence…………………………..91 \n    Inadequate Compensation and Lack of Parity  \n    with Prosecutorial Counterparts………………………………………………...94 \n \n  The Effect of the Public Defense Crisis on Indigent Criminal Defendants……………...98 \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS………………………………………………………………………..99 \nOTHER ALLEGATIONS……………………………………………………………………...101 \nCLAIMS………………………………………………………………………………………..101 \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF………………………………………………………………………..102 \n \n  7\n\nPARTIES \nPlaintiffs \n16.

Defendant the STATE OF NEW YORK is required by its own Constitution and \nlaws and by the United States Constitution to provide meaningful and effective legal \nrepresentation to indigent defendants in criminal court proceedings.  The State Capitol and center \nof State government is in Albany County. \n \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n37.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Article 30 of the New \nYork Civil Practice Law and Rules (CPLR) § 3001. \n38.  Venue is proper pursuant to Article 5 of the CPLR §§ 503(a), 503(c), and 505(a). \n  11\n\nTHE STATE’S FAILURE TO PROVIDE FOR CONSTITUTIONALLY AND LEGALLY \nADEQUATE PUBLIC DEFENSE SERVICES \n \nThe Impact of the Public Defense Crisis on the Plaintiffs \n \nKimberly Hurrell-Harring (Washington County) \n39.  Kimberly Hurrell-Harring is a registered nurse and has no prior criminal record.  \nPrior to her arrest, she held one full-time and one part-time job in order to care for her mother, \nwho is recovering from a stroke, and her four-year-old and sixteen-year-old daughters. \n40.  Mrs. Hurrell-Harring was arrested on September 29, 2007, and charged with one \ncount of introduction of prison contraband in the first degree, a felony, and possession of \nmarijuana, a violation.  Mrs. Hurrell-Harring was accused of bringing 22.1 grams, or about ¾ of \none ounce, of marijuana to her incarcerated husband for his personal use.  She faces up to seven \nyears imprisonment and up to $5000 in fines.  \n41.  Mrs. Hurrell-Harring was not represented at her arraignment, where, despite her \nlack of prior criminal history, bail was set at $10,000 cash or $20,000 bond.  Mrs. Hurrell-\nHarring could not afford to post bail and was remanded to the Washington County Jail, where \nshe remains. \n42.  Mrs. Hurrell-Harring first met her attorney at the county jail shortly after her \narraignment.  During this meeting, Mrs. Hurrell-Harring felt that her attorney took no interest in \nher case, her family, or her future.  Mrs. Hurrell-Harring’s attorney has refused to take any calls \nshe has made to his office since this initial interview.  \n43.  Although Mrs. Hurrell-Harring strongly hoped for probation, so that she could \ncontinue to support her family, her attorney did not move to reduce the felony charge to \npromoting prison contraband in the second degree, a misdemeanor, despite clear precedent \nholding that the lesser charge is the appropriate one given the small amount of marijuana \n  12\n\ninvolved.  See, e.g., People v. Stanley, 19 A.D.3d 1152, 1152, 796 N.Y.S.2d 767 768, (4th Dept. \n2005); People v. Brown, 2 A.D.3d 1216, 1216, 769 N.Y.S.2d 657, 657 (3d Dept. 2003).  On \ninformation and belief, Mrs. Hurrell-Harring’s attorney also failed to advocate for a plea bargain \nto reduced charges and/or probation given the circumstances of her offense, her lack of a prior \nrecord, and her family situation. \n44.  On October 12, 2007, having been incarcerated for several weeks and presented \nwith no other options, Mrs. Hurrell-Harring pled guilty to promoting prison contraband in the \nfirst degree.  During the court proceeding in which she pled guilty, it was clear that her attorney \nhad not informed her of the full consequences of the plea prior to her decision to enter it.   \n45.  Ms. Hurrell-Harring will be sentenced on November 16, 2007.  Based on her plea \nbargain, she expects to be sentenced to six months imprisonment and five years of probation.  As \na result of this felony conviction, Mrs. Hurrell-Harring stands to lose her license to serve as a \nregistered nurse, a profession she has served in for twelve years.  \n46.  The State of New York has not provided Mrs. Hurrell-Harring with the \nrepresentation to which she is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as she was not \nrepresented at all critical stages; has not had sufficient opportunity to discuss with her attorney \nthe factual basis for the charges against her, to participate in building a defense to those charges, \nor to make informed decisions regarding the progress and disposition of her case; and has been \ndenied investigative services, motions practice and vigorous advocacy that could have \ncontributed to her defense and/or brought an end to unnecessary incarceration. Upon information \nand belief, the State of New York will continue to fail to provide Mrs. Hurrell-Harring with the \nlegal representation to which she is entitled as her case proceeds. \n  13\n\n47.  The representation provided to Mrs. Hurrell-Harring is illustrative of the pattern \nof representation provided to indigent defendants in the Counties and results from of the \nstructural and systemic failings that led the Kaye Commission to conclude that New York State \nis failing to meet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, \nincluding the absence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate funding of the \ncurrent county-operated and largely county-financed public defense system.   \n \nJames Adams (Onondaga County) \n48.  James Adams was arrested on July 31, 2007, and charged with robbery in the \nthird degree, burglary in the third degree, and harassment in the second degree, all felonies.  Mr. \nAdams is accused of shoplifting several sticks of deodorant from a drug store.  If convicted, Mr. \nAdams faces a maximum sentence of fourteen years imprisonment on these charges. \n49.  Mr. Adams was represented by an attorney at his arraignment but was assigned a \ndifferent attorney during the arraignment.  Bail was set at $2500, which Mr. Adams could not \nafford. \n50.  Mr. Adams has never seen his attorney outside of open court.  Mr. Adams first \nsaw his attorney at a court appearance on August 7, 2007.  During this appearance, Mr. Adams’s \nattorney asked for a one-week adjournment because he had neither reviewed his client’s file nor \nhad time to prepare for the hearing.  Mr. Adams’s attorney was not even aware that his client was \nincarcerated.  When the hearing ended, Mr. Adams asked his attorney for a chance to speak \nabout his about his case, but Mr. Adams’s attorney did not meet with him. \n51.  On August 14 and September 4, 2007, Mr. Adams again appeared in court.  Both \ntimes, his case was adjourned.  On each occasion, Mr. Adams asked his attorney for a meeting, \n  14\n\nbut no meeting occurred.  During these court appearances, the judge encouraged the prosecutor \nand defense counsel to negotiate the felony burglary and robbery charges down to misdemeanor \npetit larceny, but the attorneys did not do so. \n52.  On September 18, 2007, Mr. Adams appeared in court again but his attorney did \nnot appear.  The prosecutor attempted to present Mr. Adams with a notice that his felony charges \nhad been referred to a Grand Jury, but the judge admonished the prosecutor that notice must be \nserved on Mr. Adams’s counsel.  During this appearance, Mr. Adams heard the prosecutor tell \nthe judge that he had extended a plea offer to Mr. Adams.  Mr. Adams’s attorney never \ncommunicated that offer to Mr. Adams.  \n53.  Mr. Adams wanted to discuss the possibility of exercising his right to appear \nbefore the Grand Jury with his attorney but, unable to reach his attorney, Mr. Adams lost his \nopportunity to do so.  Mr. Adams was indicted on felony burglary and robbery charges on \nSeptember 21, 2007. \n54.  Mr. Adams has attempted to contact his attorney several times between his court \nappearances, but his attorney’s dedicated voicemail box is always full and his office does not \naccept collect phone calls from the jail.  Mr. Adams’s wife also has called his attorney several \ntimes, but the attorney never returned her calls.  Mr. Adams contacted Jail Ministry, a prisoner-\nrights organization, to ask them to call his attorney on his behalf, but Mr. Adams’s attorney still \nnever contacted him. \n55.  On September 25, 2007, Mr. Adams attempted to file his own pro se motion \nunder NY CPL § 190.80, which generally requires release of any person accused of a felony who \nhas not been indicted within forty-five days of arrest. Without an attorney to provide counsel, he \n  15\n\nsimply mailed form papers obtained from the prison law library and he is not sure whether he \nproperly filed his motion.   \n56.  Still unable to reach his attorney, Mr. Adams wrote directly to the district attorney \non October 3, 2007, explaining the facts of his case and alleging that he had been misidentified \nby the prosecution’s witnesses.  \n57.  During a court appearance on October 5, 2007, Mr. Adams hand-delivered a letter \nto his attorney and to the prosecutor complaining about the lack of attorney-client \ncommunication and explaining the possible misidentification.  During this court appearance, \nwithout prompting from Mr. Adams’s attorney, the judge expressed concern that Mr. Adams had \nbeen overcharged for felony burglary and robbery for allegedly stealing deodorant from a drug \nstore.  The judge suggested that because of this concern he would review the Grand Jury \nminutes.  Despite these statements from the judge questioning the basis for the indictment, Mr. \nAdams’s attorney did not file a motion to dismiss the indictment. \n58.  During his most recent court appearance, on October 19, 2007, the judge ordered \nMr. Adams’s attorney to file a motion to dismiss the indictment.  As with his prior court \nappearances, Mr. Adams’s attorney did not speak to Mr. Adams before or after the appearance. \n59.  Mr. Adams has not had any contact with his attorney in nearly a month and does \nnot know the status of his case.  Mr. Adams has spent many hours in the jail law library trying to \nunderstand what it means to dismiss an indictment and what the judge’s suggestion to file this \nmotion means for his case.   \n60.  As of the filing of this complaint, Mr. Adams has been incarcerated for more than \nthree months for allegedly stealing deodorant from a drug store.  Mr. Adams’s next court \n  16\n\nappearance is scheduled for November 30, 2007, at which time he will have been incarcerated \nfor four months. \n61.  As a result of his arrest and incarceration, Mr. Adams, lost his job as a day laborer \nand is unable to support his wife, his two teenage daughters, and his granddaughter.  Mr. \nAdams’s family was evicted from their home because they could not afford to pay rent without \nhis income.     \n62.  The State of New York has failed to provide Mr. Adams with the representation \nto which he is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as he has not had sufficient \nopportunity to discuss his case with his attorney, to participate in building a defense to the charge \nagainst him, or to make informed decisions regarding the progress and disposition of his case; \nhas been deprived of investigative assistance, motions practice and vigorous advocacy that may \ncontribute to a favorable resolution of the charge against him and/or an end to unnecessary \nincarceration; and does not understand where his case stands or the status of the charges against \nhim.  Upon information and belief, the State of New York will continue to fail to provide Mr. \nAdams with the legal representation to which he is entitled as his case proceeds. \n63.  The representation provided to Mr. Adams is illustrative of the pattern of \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants in the Counties and results from the structural and \nsystemic failings that led the Kaye Commission to conclude that New York State is failing to \nmeet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, including the \nabsence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate funding of the current \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed public defense system. \n \nJoseph Briggs (Onondaga County) \n  17\n\n64.  Joseph Briggs was arrested on August 7, 2007, and charged with possession of \nstolen property in the third degree, a felony.  Because of prior felony convictions, Mr. Briggs \nfaces a maximum life sentence if convicted of these charges. \n65.  Prior to his arrest, Mr. Briggs was a self-employed roofer who was attempting to \nstart his own small roofing business. \n66.  Mr. Briggs was not represented by an attorney at his arraignment, at which he was \ndenied bail.   \n67.  Mr. Briggs first saw his attorney at a court appearance on September 4, 2007, \nalmost a month after his arrest and incarceration.  In the preceding weeks, Mr. Briggs, who was \neager to speak to his attorney about his case and ask about the possibility of a bail reduction so \nhe could get back to work, learned that his attorney had adjourned several court appearances \nwithout consulting him.  While awaiting this court appearance, Mr. Briggs asked the court \ndeputy to ask his lawyer to come speak to him in the holding cell to discuss his case and prepare \nfor the appearance, but Mr. Briggs’s attorney did not do so.    \n68.  Mr. Briggs next saw his attorney on September 10, 2007, in a meeting that lasted \napproximately five minutes.  After that brief meeting, Mr. Briggs attempted on numerous \noccasions to contact his attorney from the jail, but his attorney’s dedicated voicemail box was \nalways full and his office did not accept collect calls from the jail.  Mr. Briggs also wrote to his \nattorney but never received any response.   \n69.  Mr. Briggs was indicted on September 19, 2007.  Mr. Briggs’s attorney never \nconsulted with him before waiving his right to a preliminary hearing and never discussed with \nhim his right to testify before the Grand Jury. \n  18\n\n70.  Mr. Briggs next appeared in court on October 10, 2007.  Mr. Briggs’s attorney did \nnot appear in court on that day.  The judge asked Mr. Briggs if he would like to get a new \nattorney. Mr. Briggs said yes, and the judge assigned a new attorney. \n71.  Mr. Briggs has never met or spoken with his new attorney.  He has written to her \nthree times and tried to call his new attorney but her voicemail box is always full and her office \ndoes not accept collect calls from the jail.  Meanwhile, Mr. Briggs has been unable to discuss \nwith his attorney the possibility of moving to dismiss the indictment because he was denied an \nopportunity to testify before the Grand Jury, file other motions for release based on his prolonged \nand unnecessary pretrial incarceration, or obtain a copy of his file because his attorney has not \nresponded to these letters.   \n72.  Mr. Briggs contacted Jail Ministry, a prisoner rights organization, to ask for its \nhelp in contacting his attorney, but Jail Ministry told him that it had passed along so many \ncomplaints about lack of attorney-client contact to that particular attorney that she had instructed \nthe organization never to call her about her clients again. \n73.  Mr. Briggs’s next court date is not scheduled until December 7, 2007.  Mr. \nBriggs, who has been incarcerated since August 7, 2007, does not understand why his next court \ndate is so far away or what is happening with his case. \n74.  Upon information and belief, neither of Mr. Briggs’s attorneys has conducted any \nindependent investigation into the facts surrounding Mr. Briggs’s case or the existence of any \npossible defenses that might be available to him.   \n75.  The State of New York has failed to provide Mr. Briggs with the representation to \nwhich he is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as he has not been represented in all \ncritical proceedings; has not had sufficient opportunity to discuss his case with his attorney, to \n  19\n\nparticipate in building a defense to the charge against him, or to make an informed decision \nabout the progress and disposition of his case; has been subjected to lengthy and unnecessary \npretrial incarceration; and does not understand where his case stands or the status of the charges \nagainst him.  Upon information and belief, the State of New York will continue to fail to provide \nMr. Briggs with the legal representation to which he is entitled as his case proceeds. \n76.  The representation provided to Mr. Briggs is illustrative of the pattern of \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants in the Counties and results from the structural and \nsystemic failings that led the Kaye Commission to conclude that New York State is failing to \nmeet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, including the \nabsence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate funding of the current \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed public defense system.   \n \nRicky Lee Glover (Onondaga County) \n77.  Ricky Lee Glover was arrested on June 12, 2007, and charged with burglary in the \nthird degree, a felony, and related misdemeanor charges of petit larceny and possession of \nburglary tools. Because of prior felony convictions, the maximum sentence Mr. Glover faces on \nthese charges is life imprisonment. \n78.  Mr. Glover was represented at arraignment by an attorney, but was assigned to a \nsecond attorney during the arraignment.  He was denied bail and remanded to jail, where he \nremains. \n79.  After arraignment, Mr. Glover immediately tried to contact his new attorney but \nhis attorney’s dedicated voicemail box was consistently full and her office would not accept \ncollect calls from the jail.   \n  20\n\n80.  Mr. Glover met his attorney only once, on June 21, 2007, in the jail.  According to \na grievance filed on behalf of Mr. Glover by the Onondaga County Human Rights Commission, \nduring that meeting, which lasted only a few minutes, Mr. Glover’s attorney informed him that \nhe had a “dead case” even though she admitted that she had not obtained and reviewed any files \nfrom the prosecutor or conducted any discovery or independent investigation.  Mr. Glover asked \nhis attorney to advocate for bail but she did not do so.  Mr. Glover has not seen his attorney since \nthis first meeting more than four months ago. \n81.  During their first and only meeting, again according to Mr. Glover’s grievance, \nMr. Glover specifically asked his attorney not to waive his right to a preliminary hearing.  Mr. \nGlover’s attorney adjourned his first scheduled preliminary hearing on June 15, 2007.  On June \n29, 2007, Mr. Glover’s attorney, against his specific instructions, waived Mr. Glover’s right to a \npreliminary hearing in a letter to the judge.   \n82.  On July 10, 2007, having been unable to reach his attorney for over a month, Mr. \nGlover filed his own pro se motion for release under NY CPL § 180.80, which generally requires \nrelease of any person accused of a felony who has been held for more than 120 hours after arrest \nwithout a preliminary hearing.  Mr. Glover was unaware that his attorney had already waived his \npreliminary hearing.  Mr. Glover only found out that his right had been waived months later \nwhen he called the Onondaga County Human Rights Commission. \n83.  Since their first and only meeting in June, Mr. Glover has neither met with his \nattorney nor been able to reach her by telephone.  Mr. Glover’s family has also attempted to \nreach his attorney several times.  On one occasion, Mr. Glover’s mother was able to reach his \nattorney, who told his mother that Mr. Glover was “about to get out.”  Months later, Mr. Glover \nremains in jail. \n  21\n\n84.  On October 6, 2007, Mr. Glover, still unable to reach his attorney, filed his own \npro se motion under NY CPL § 190.80, which generally requires release of any person accused \nof a felony who has not been indicted within 45 days of arrest. Without an attorney to provide \ncounsel, Mr. Glover did not know where to file the motion and remains unsure whether it was \nproperly filed.  \n85.  On October 15, 2007, Mr. Glover learned that the felony charges he was facing \nhad been reduced to misdemeanor charges.  He learned this because an attorney grievance \ncommittee forwarded a copy of a letter his attorney had written to that committee defending her \nrepresentation of Mr. Glover against his complaint.  His attorney never communicated this \ninformation to Mr. Glover; he would not have known if he had not received this letter from the \ngrievance committee. \n86.  Since learning his charges were reduced, Mr. Glover has been researching in the \njail law library whether he can file his own motion for a bail reduction so he can get out of \npretrial detention.   \n87.  Mr. Glover’s attorney also represents him on pending traffic violations in the \nOnondaga Town Court.  Mr. Glover is anxious to have a hearing and resolve those charges, but \nhis attorney has adjourned his hearing at least four times without consulting with Mr. Glover.  \nUnable to reach his attorney to address this issue, Mr. Glover wrote directly to the town court \njustice to ask him not to allow his attorney to adjourn his case again. \n88.  Mr. Glover is concerned that his attorney may have a conflict of interest because \nshe may have represented his daughter in a family court proceeding involving him. He has been \nunable to raise this issue with his attorney, however, because he cannot reach her. \n  22\n\n89.  As of the filing of this complaint, Mr. Glover has been incarcerated 148 days and \nhas had no direct contact with his attorney since June 21, 2007, more than four months ago.   \n90.  The State of New York has not provided Mr. Glover with the representation to \nwhich he is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as he has not had sufficient opportunity \nto discuss his case with his attorney, to participate in building a defense to the charges against \nhim, or to make informed decisions about the progress and disposition of his case; has been \ndeprived of investigative assistance, motions practice and vigorous advocacy that may contribute \nto a favorable resolution of his case and/or an end to unnecessary incarceration; may have been \ndeprived to the right to appointment of counsel free of conflicts of interest; and does not \nunderstand where his case stands or the status of the charges against him.  Upon information and \nbelief, the State of New York will continue to fail to provide Mr. Glover with the legal \nrepresentation to which he is entitled as his case proceeds. \n91.  The representation provided to Mr. Glover is illustrative of the pattern of \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants in the Counties and results from the structural and \nsystemic failings that led the Kaye Commission to conclude that New York State is failing to \nmeet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, including the \nabsence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate funding of the current \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed public defense system.   \n \nRichard Love, Jr. (Onondaga County) \n92.  Richard Love, Jr. was arrested on September 12, 2007, and charged with grand \nlarceny in the third degree and criminal possession of a forged instrument, both felonies.  Upon \n  23\n\ninformation and belief, Mr. Love faces sentencing as a repeat felony offender and could face a \nlife sentence on these charges. \n93.  Mr. Love was not represented by an attorney at his initial arraignment, at which \nhe was denied bail.   \n94.  Mr. Love first saw his attorney days after his arraignment when he came to the \njail for a few minutes so that Mr. Love could sign a form that the attorney needed so he could get \npaid.  Mr. Love next saw his attorney during a court appearance weeks later, in late September.  \nMr. Love’s attorney did not meet or speak with Mr. Love before or after the appearance.  During \nthe proceeding, Mr. Love did not understand what was going on and was not even sure what \ncharges were being discussed.   \n95.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Love’s attorney has not conducted any \nindependent investigation into the facts surrounding Mr. Love’s case or the existence of any \npossible defenses that might be available to him.   \n96.  Mr. Love was eager to file a motion for bail so he could return to work, but his \nattorney did not file a bail reduction motion. Mr. Love remains incarcerated. \n97.  Mr. Love has attempted on numerous occasions to contact his attorney from jail \nbut his attorney’s dedicated voicemail box is usually full and his office does not accept collect \ncalls from the jail.  Mr. Love’s family has also attempted to reach his attorney without success.  \nMr. Love called the Onondaga County Assigned Counsel Program to seek its assistance in \ncontacting his attorney, but the Onondaga County Assigned Counsel Program informed him that \nit could not help him. \n98.  On October 5, 2007, Mr. Love wrote to the judge and asked to proceed pro se \nrather than continue to be represented by his current attorney.   \n  24\n\n99.  On October 26, 2007, Mr. Love appeared before a different judge.  Mr. Love’s \nattorney once again did not prepare Mr. Love for this appearance or meet with him prior to \nentering the courtroom.  During this proceeding, the prosecutor presented a plea offer that Mr. \nLove had already rejected.  Because his attorney had failed to do so, Mr. Love began to negotiate \ndirectly with the judge and the prosecutor and to advocate for a reduction to misdemeanor \ncharges.  Mr. Love told the judge that he felt uncomfortable taking a plea because he had never \nmet with his attorney to discuss the facts of his case.  Upon hearing this, the judge agreed to \nassign a new attorney to Mr. Love.   \n100.  Mr. Love is a veteran of the United States Navy.  He is married with two grown \nchildren and seven grandchildren.  Before he was arrested, Mr. Love held two jobs to support his \nfamily.  Because he has been incarcerated for nearly two months, he lost both of his jobs.  \n101.  The State of New York has not provided Mr. Love with the representation to \nwhich he is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as he has not been represented in all \ncritical proceedings; has not had sufficient opportunity to discuss his case with his attorney, to \nparticipate in building a defense the charges against him, or to make an informed decision about \nthe progress and disposition of his case; and has been deprived of investigative assistance, \nmotions practice and vigorous advocacy that may contribute to a favorable resolution of his \ncharges and/or an end to unnecessary incarceration.  Upon information and belief, the State of \nNew York will continue to fail to provide Mr. Love with the legal representation to which he is \nentitled as his case proceeds. \n102.  The representation provided to Mr. Love is illustrative of the pattern of \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants in the Counties and results from the structural and \nsystemic failings that led the Kaye Commission to conclude that New York State is failing to \n  25\n\nmeet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, including the \nabsence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate funding of the current \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed public defense system.   \n \nJacqueline Winbrone (Onondaga)   \n103.  Jacqueline Winbrone was arrested on September 12, 2007, and charged with \npossession of a loaded firearm in the second degree, a felony.  After being called to her home \nbecause of a domestic dispute, the police searched the Winbrone family’s car and found the \nfirearm, which Mrs. Winbrone stated was not hers and must belong to her husband.  The \nmaximum sentence Mrs. Winbrone faces on these charges is 15 years imprisonment. \n104.  Prior to her arrest, Mrs. Winbrone was the sole caretaker for her seriously ill \nhusband, who relied on her to transport him to dialysis treatment several times a week.  Shortly \nafter Mrs. Winbrone was arrested, her husband passed away.  Mrs. Winbrone believes that her \nhusband died because he had no one to care for him and transport him to dialysis.  Because no \none was able to make rent payments while she was incarcerated, Mrs. Winbrone has been evicted \nfrom her home.   \n105.  Mrs. Winbrone was represented at arraignment but was assigned to a different \nattorney during the arraignment.  Bail was set at $10,000, which she could not afford. \n106.  After arraignment, Mrs. Winbrone wished to seek a bail reduction so she could \ntake care of her family.  She attempted to contact her attorney but his dedicated voicemail box \nwas consistently full and his office would not accept collect calls from the jail.   \n107.  On September 16, 2007, Mrs. Winbrone learned that her husband had died.  \nBecause the jail permitted her to make a non-collect call, Mrs. Winbrone was able to reach her \n  26\n\nattorney in his office for the first time and ask him to petition for a bail reduction so she could \nleave jail and attend the funeral.  Her attorney nevertheless failed to obtain a bail reduction \nhearing until a few days later, after the funeral had already occurred.  At the bail reduction \nhearing, the court reduced bail to $5000, which Mrs. Winbrone, who is on public assistance, still \ncould not afford.  In open court, Mrs. Winbrone tried to explain to her attorney that this bail \nreduction would not make any difference, but he did not respond.  At the end of the hearing, Mrs. \nWinbrone asked her attorney if they could meet, but he left without speaking to her.  \n108.  On September 17, 2007, without consulting with Mrs. Winbrone or explaining the \nreasons, Mrs. Winbrone’s attorney waived her right to a preliminary hearing.   \n109.  Thereafter, Mrs. Winbrone tried several times to reach her attorney by phone \nwithout success.  She wrote to him, asked her mother to call him long-distance from Georgia, \nand called a prisoner-rights organization to ask it to reach out to him, again without success.  \nUnable to reach her attorney, Mrs. Winbrone wrote a letter to the judge in her case explaining the \nfacts of her case, hoping the judge would help her get out of jail. \n110.  Mrs. Winbrone next saw her attorney several weeks later at a court appearance on \nNovember 1, 2007, which she believes was scheduled because of the letter she wrote to the \njudge.  During this appearance, her attorney did not speak to her at all.  She did not understand \nwhat was happening during this proceeding.  When she heard her attorney misstating certain \nfacts of her case to the judge, she tried to correct him, but was told that her attorney must speak \non her behalf in court. \n111.  Upon information and belief, Mrs. Winbrone’s attorney has not conducted any \nindependent investigation into the facts surrounding Mrs. Winbrone’s case or the existence of \nany possible defenses that might have been available to her. \n  27\n\n112.  On November 2, 2007, Mrs. Winbrone appeared before the court and was \nreleased on her own recognizance after spending almost two months in jail.  Mrs. Winbrone \nbelieves that her release is a result of a meeting she had with advocates from an Onondaga \nCounty pretrial release program, not the result of any advocacy by her attorney.   \n113.  The State of New York has not provided Mrs. Winbrone with the representation \nto which she is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as she has not had sufficient \nopportunity to discuss her case with her attorney, to participate in building a defense to the \ncharge against her, or to make informed decisions about the progress and disposition of her \ncharge; has been deprived of investigative assistance, motions practice and vigorous advocacu \nthat may have contributed to a favorable disposition of her charge and/or and end to unnecessary \nincarceration; and was subjected to several weeks of unnecessary incarceration.  Upon \ninformation and belief, the State of New York will continue to fail to provide Mrs. Winbrone \nwith the legal representation to which she is entitled as her case proceeds. \n114.  The representation provided to Mrs. Winbrone is illustrative of the pattern of \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants in the Counties and is results from the structural \nand systemic failings that led the Kaye Commission to conclude that New York State is failing to \nmeet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, including the \nabsence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate funding of the current \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed public defense system.   \n \nLane Loyzelle (Ontario County) \n  28\n\n115.  Lane Loyzelle was arrested on September 27, 2007 and charged with petit \nlarceny, a misdemeanor, for allegedly stealing twenty dollars from two people he knew.  He \nfaces a maximum sentence of one year imprisonment, as well as fines of up to $1000. \n116.  At his arraignment, Mr. Loyzelle was not provided with an attorney.  Bail was set \nat $2500 cash or $5000 bond, which he could not afford.  Mr. Loyzelle asked the judge to lower \nthe bail so that he could return to work and not lose his job.  His request was denied and he was \nremanded to the Ontario County Jail.  Mr. Loyzelle has now lost his job. \n117.  Mr. Loyzelle has met with his attorney only once.  This meeting took place \nimmediately before a court appearance on October 10, 2007, lasted approximately five minutes, \nand took place in the holding area outside the courtroom, in full hearing of other inmates.  Mr. \nLoyzelle was uncomfortable discussing his case in front of other inmates, but Mr. Loyzelle’s \nattorney never met with him other than in this public space. \n118.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Loyzelle’s attorney never conducted any \nindependent investigation into the facts surrounding Mr. Loyzelle’s case or the existence of any \nvalid defenses that might have been available.   \n119.  As of the filing of the complaint, Mr. Loyzelle has been incarcerated for six \nweeks for allegedly stealing $20 and has not had any contact with his attorney for almost a \nmonth. \n120.  The State of New York has not provided Mr. Loyzelle with the representation to \nwhich he is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as he has not been provided with \nrepresentation at every critical stage; has not had sufficient opportunity to discuss his case with \nhis attorney, to participate in the building of a defense against the charges he faces, or to make \ninformed decisions about the progress and disposition of his case; and has been denied \n  29\n\ninvestigative assistance, motions practice and vigorous advocacy that may contribute to a \nfavorable resolution of his case.  Upon information and belief, the State of New York will \ncontinue to fail to provide Mr. Loyzelle with the legal representation to which he is entitled as \nhis case proceeds. \n121.  The representation provided to Mr. Loyzelle is illustrative of the pattern of \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants in the Counties and results from the structural and \nsystemic failings that led the Kaye Commission to conclude that New York State is failing to \nmeet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, including the \nabsence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate funding of the current \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed public defense system.   \n \nTosha Steele (Ontario County) \n122.  Tosha Steele was arrested on July 25, 2007, and charged with criminal possession \nof a controlled substance in the third degree, a felony.  Ms. Steele, who has three children, faces \na maximum of 25 years in prison and fines of up to $30,000. \n123.  Ms. Steele’s attorney has never visited her in jail.  She has only seen her attorney \ntwice since her arrest in July, both times during or immediately prior to court appearances and \nhas spoken briefly on the phone with him once when she was able to reach him from the jail.  \n124.  Ms. Steele first met her attorney immediately before a court appearance for \napproximately five to ten minutes in the holding area outside the courtroom, in full hearing of \nother inmates.  \n125.  Ms. Steele did not see her attorney again until her next court appearance almost a \nmonth later, on August 20, 2007.  Without meeting with or consulting Ms. Steele beforehand, \n  30\n\nMs. Steele’s attorney waived her right to a preliminary hearing.  Ms. Steele was confused about \nwhat had occurred but her attorney never explained it to her. \n126.  Ms. Steele’s attorney failed to appear in court for her most recent court \nappearance on October 5, 2007, and her case was adjourned, prolonging her pre-trial \nincarceration.  Ms. Steele’s attorney has not contacted her to explain his failure to appear in court \nor to notify her of her next court date. \n127.  Upon information and belief, Ms. Steele’s attorney has not conducted any \nindependent investigation into the facts surrounding Ms. Steele’s case or any possible defenses \nthat may be available to her.     \n128.  As of the filing of this complaint, Ms. Steele has been incarcerated for more than \nthree months and has not had any contact with her attorney for more than two months. \n129.  The State of New York has failed to provide Ms. Steele with the representation to \nwhich she is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as she has not had sufficient \nopportunity to discuss her case with her attorney, to participate in building a defense to the \ncharges against her, or to make informed decisions about the progress and disposition of her \ncase; has been subjected to lengthy and unnecessary pretrial incarceration; has been deprived of \ninvestigative services, motions practice and vigorous advocacy that could contribute to her \ndefense and/or bring an end to unnecessary incarceration; and does not understand where her \ncase stands or the status of the charges against her.  Upon information and belief, the State of \nNew York will continue to fail to provide Ms. Steele with the legal representation to which she is \nentitled as her case proceeds. \n130.  The representation provided to Ms. Steele is illustrative of the pattern of \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants in the Counties and results from the structural and \n  31\n\nsystemic failings that led the Kaye Commission to conclude that New York State is failing to \nmeet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, including the \nabsence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate funding of the current \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed public defense system.   \n \nBruce Washington (Ontario County)   \n131.  Bruce Washington was arrested on August 20, 2007, and charged with petit \nlarceny, a misdemeanor.  He faces a maximum sentence of one year imprisonment, as well as \nfines of up to $1000.  \n132.  At arraignment, Mr. Washington was not represented by counsel.  Bail was set at \n$1500 cash or $3000 bond, which he could not afford, and he was remanded to jail. \n133.  Mr. Washington’s first meeting with his attorney occurred several days after his \narrest at the Ontario County Jail and lasted less than ten minutes.  Outside of this first meeting, \nMr. Washington has never met with his attorney in the jail.  All other contact has occurred solely \nbefore or after scheduled court appearances and has lasted no more than a few minutes.   \n134.  Mr. Washington’s attorney is a specialist in real estate and tax law, not criminal \ndefense.   \n135.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Washington’s attorney never conducted any \nindependent investigation into the facts surrounding Mr. Washington’s case or the existence of \nany valid defenses that might have been available.   \n136.  After remaining in jail for almost two months unable to discuss a possible defense \nwith his attorney, Mr. Washington pled guilty as charged on October 16, 2007.  At the time of \nhis plea, Mr. Washington was not informed of the full consequences of his guilty plea.  For \n  32\n\nexample, after his plea had been entered, Mr. Washington learned that the lengthy pre-sentencing \ninvestigation required in his case would result in his being incarcerated for approximately three \nweeks longer than the sentence contemplated by his plea agreement.  Mr. Washington’s attorney \nhas not met with Mr. Washington since entering the guilty plea and, upon information and belief, \nhas not taken any action to address the delay in sentencing.  Mr. Washington’s sentencing \nhearing is scheduled for January 8, 2008.   \n137.  The State of New York has not provided Mr. Washington with the representation \nto which he is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as he has not been represented at \nevery critical stage of the proceedings; has not had sufficient opportunity to discuss his case with \nhis attorney, to participate in building a defense to the charges against him, or to make informed \ndecisions about the progress and disposition of his case; was deprived of investigative assistance, \nmotions practice and vigorous advocacy that may have contributed to his defense; and has been  \nsubjected to lengthy and unnecessary pretrial incarceration.  Upon information and belief, the \nState of New York will continue to fail to provide Mr. Washington with the legal representation \nto which he is entitled as his case proceeds. \n138.  The representation provided to Mr. Washington is illustrative of the pattern of \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants in the Counties and is results from the structural \nand systemic failings that led the Kaye Commission to conclude that New York State is failing to \nmeet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, including the \nabsence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate funding of the current \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed public defense system.   \n \nShawn Chase (Schuyler County) \n  33\n\n139.  Shawn Chase was arrested on April 6, 2007, and charged with driving while \nintoxicated and driving with a blood alcohol level over 0.08%, both misdemeanors, and \npossession of an open container of alcohol in a motor vehicle, a traffic infraction.  Mr. Chase \nfaces a maximum of one year of imprisonment plus fines on these charges. \n140.  Mr. Chase’s case was delayed five months before he was deemed eligible for a \npublic defense attorney.  After repeated denials of his application for representation by the \nSchuyler County Public Defender’s Office, he was finally assigned counsel by a judge. \n141.  Mr. Chase submitted his first application for public defense services shortly after \nhis first court appearance, in late April or early May 2007.  When he applied, he was incorrectly \ntold that he would have a hard time obtaining an attorney because his charges were mere traffic \nviolations.  The public defender’s office later denied his application based on his household \nincome and unspecified county guidelines, despite the fact that Mr. Chase has previously been \nfound eligible for public defense services in a neighboring county. \n142.  Once a month between May and October of 2007, Mr. Chase appeared in court \nand was told his case must be adjourned so that he could obtain counsel.  During this time, Mr. \nChase applied for a public defender approximately three additional times.  Upon information and \nbelief, his application was denied each time also on the basis of his household income and \nunspecified county guidelines. \n143.  At a court appearance in August of 2007, Mr. Chase, frustrated with his inability \nto obtain an attorney, provided the court, the prosecutor, and the assistant pubic defender with a \nletter prepared by a retired lawyer explaining why Mr. Chase was entitled to a public defender.  \nAt his next court appearance, in September of 2007, the judge ordered the Schuyler County \n  34\n\nPublic Defender’s office to represent Mr. Chase.  During this court appearance, four months after \nhis arrest, Mr. Chase finally met with his attorney for the first time.   \n144.  At Mr. Chase’s trial, on October 30, 2007, Mr. Chase discovered only ten minutes \nbefore he took the stand that he would be testifying.  He was not prepared for his testimony.  Mr. \nChase was convicted of driving while intoxicated.  Mr. Chase erroneously believes that this \nconviction will bar him from obtaining a commercial license for his planned career as a civil \nengineer.  His attorney has not met with him since his conviction. \n145.  Mr. Chase’s sentencing hearing is scheduled for December 19, 2007.  Mr. Chase \nis not sure what sentence he could face and how that sentence could impact his future plans. \n146.  The State of New York has failed to provide Mr. Chase with the representation to \nwhich he is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as he experienced unnecessary and \nprolonged delay in the appointment of counsel based on incoherent and excessively restrictive \neligibility standards; did not have sufficient opportunity to make informed decisions about the \nprogress and disposition of his case; and was denied effective representation at trial.  Upon \ninformation and belief, the State of New York will continue to fail to provide Mr. Chase with the \nlegal representation to which he is entitled as his case proceeds. \n147.  The representation provided to Mr. Chase is illustrative of the pattern of \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants in the Counties and results from the structural and \nsystemic failings that led the Kaye Commission to conclude that New York State is failing to \nmeet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, including the \nabsence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate funding of the current \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed public defense system.   \n \n  35\n\nJemar Johnson (Schuyler County) \n148.  Jemar Johnson was arrested on August 30, 2007, and charged with criminal \npossession of a controlled substance in the third degree, a felony.  Ms. Johnson faces a maximum \nsentence of nine years imprisonment if convicted. \n149.  Ms. Johnson was not represented at arraignment, where bail was set at $15,000 \ncash or $30,000 bond.  Unable to pay this amount, she was remanded to jail. \n150.  On September 10, 2007, Ms. Johnson’s case was scheduled for a hearing, but Ms. \nJohnson was not taken to court and did not hear from her attorney to explain why she did not \nappear in court.  The next day she found out from a corrections officer that her bail had been \nreduced to $10,000 cash or $20,000 bond.  Still unable to pay, she remained in jail.   \n151.  Ms. Johnson has met her attorney only once, shortly after her arraignment.  She is \nunable to call her attorney because his office does not accept collect calls from the jail.  She \nwrote to him at least three times before he came to visit her again, at the end of September.   \n152.  Upon information and belief, Ms. Johnson’s attorney has conducted no \nindependent investigation into the charges Ms. Johnson faces, including contacting any of the \nwitnesses who could assist her defense.   \n153.  Ms. Johnson received a plea offer from the district attorney but she cannot make \nan informed decision about whether to accept the plea because she does not understand the full, \ncollateral consequence of such a conviction, including the possible impact on her public \nassistance.  Ms. Johnson has lost confidence that her attorney will provide her with good advice \nabout whether to accept a plea or proceed to trial, and does not trust that her attorney is capable \nof mounting a defense for her at trial. \n  36\n\n154.  As of the filing of the complaint, Ms. Johnson has been incarcerated for more than \ntwo months.  Although biologically male, Ms. Johnson identifies as a female and is \nuncomfortable being housed in with other men in the Schuyler County Jail.  Her prolonged \nincarceration is harming her ability to obtain her General Educational Development certificate, \nwhich she was working for prior to her arrest.  Although Ms. Johnson is ready to take the GED \ntest, no one will come from Albany to administer the test to her because she is the only one in the \nSchuyler County Jail who is ready to take it. \n155.  The State of New York has failed to provide Ms. Johnson with the representation \nto which she is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as she has not been represented in all \ncritical proceedings; has not had sufficient opportunity to discuss her case with her attorney, to \nparticipate in building a defense to the charge against her, or to make informed decision about \nthe progress and disposition of her case; has been denied access to investigative services, \nmotions practice and vigorous advocacy that could contribute to her defense; and has been \nsubjected to prolonged and unnecessary incarceration. Upon information and belief, the State of \nNew York will continue to fail to provide Ms. Johnson with the legal representation to which she \nis entitled as her case proceeds. \n156.  The representation provided to Ms. Johnson is illustrative of the pattern of \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants in the Counties and results from the structural and \nsystemic failings that led the Kaye Commission to conclude that New York State is failing to \nmeet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, including the \nabsence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate funding of the current \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed public defense system.   \n \n  37\n\nRobert Tomberelli (Schuyler County) \n157.  Robert Tomberelli was arrested on June 15, 2007, and charged with driving while \nunder the influence of alcohol, a misdemeanor; aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor \nvehicle in the first degree, a felony; and two traffic infractions for having no headlights and \nparking in an intersection.  Mr. Tomberelli faces a maximum sentence of 4 years imprisonment. \n158.  At his arraignment on June 15, 2007, Mr. Tomberelli was not represented by \ncounsel and he was released on his own recognizance. \n159.  Mr. Tomberelli has been represented by two different attorneys in his case \nbecause his case was originally in town court, which is covered by the one attorney, and was \nlater transferred to county court, which is covered by a different attorney. \n160.  On July 26, 2007, Mr. Tomberelli met with his second attorney.  During this \nmeeting, his attorney called the prosecutor’s office and, despite the fact that she had not yet \ndiscussed the issue with Mr. Tomberelli, informed the prosecutor that Mr. Tomberelli would \nwaive his right to an indictment before a grand jury. \n161.  On October 4, 2007, Mr. Tomberelli waived his right to grand jury indictment and \nentered guilty pleas to the offenses of driving while under the influence of alcohol and \naggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle.  The guilty plea would subject him to the \njurisdiction of Schuyler County’s specialty drug court.  Mr. Tomberelli is unsure whether his \nguilty plea means he will face prison time, what it means that his plea subjects him to the \njurisdiction of the drug court, or what the possible collateral consequences of his guilty plea \nmight be.  Mr. Tomberelli felt pressured to plead because he was given only a short amount of \ntime to accept or reject the plea, and he did not understand whether he had any other options, \nsuch as going to trial or negotiating a better plea. \n  38\n\n162.  Mr. Tomberelli’s sentencing is scheduled for November 15, 2007.  Although he \nhas expressed concern about terms of probation that would confine him to Schuyler County \nbecause his job is in another county, upon information and belief, his attorney has not raised this \nissue with a probation officer or the district attorney. \n163.  The State of New York has failed to provide Mr. Tomberelli with the \nrepresentation to which he is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as he was not \nrepresented in all critical stages; was deprived of consistent, vertical representation; and has not \nhad sufficient opportunity to discuss his case with his attorney, to participate in building a \ndefense to the charges against him, or make informed decisions about the progress and \ndisposition of his case.  Upon information and belief, the State of New York will continue to fail \nto provide Mr. Tomberelli with the legal representation to which he is entitled as his case \nproceeds. \n164.  The representation provided to Mr. Tomberelli is illustrative of the pattern of \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants in the Counties and results from the structural and \nsystemic failings that led the Kaye Commission to conclude that New York State is failing to \nmeet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, including the \nabsence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate funding of the current \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed public defense system.  \n \nChristopher Yaw (Schuyler County)  \n165.  Christopher Yaw was arrested on June 25, 2007, for the felony crime of grand \nlarceny in the fourth degree.  He was arraigned without counsel in Dix Town Court, where bail \nwas set at $5000 cash or $10,000 bond.  Unable to pay this amount, he was remanded to the \n  39\n\nSchuyler County Jail.  He was later transferred to the Chemung County Jail, where he remains.  \nMr. Yaw faces a maximum sentence of 4 years imprisonment on this charge. \n166.  Although Mr. Yaw agreed to waive both his right to a preliminary hearing and his \nright to a grand jury indictment, he did not fully understand the consequences of these waivers at \nthe time.   \n167.  In September, 2007, Mr. Yaw wrote two letters to his attorney but received no \nresponse.  Subsequently, his attorney said she would visit him on October 19, 2007, but she did \nnot do so.  In late October, Mr. Yaw learned that his November 1, 2007, court appearance had \nbeen adjourned.  His attorney has provided no explanation for the adjournment. \n168.  On September 20, 2007, Mr. Yaw was arraigned in Orange Town Court on \nmisdemeanor charges and traffic infractions related to his felony charge.  Because these charges \nare filed in a different court and the Schuyler County Public Defender’s office assigns different \nattorneys to each court, Mr. Yaw is represented by a different attorney on these charges even \nthough they arise out of the same alleged incident as his felony charge. \n169.  Mr. Yaw understands only through his own research that one of the offers being \nconsidered by the district attorney for his felony charge is equivalent to a sentence he could get if \nhe went to trial on that charge.  Although he wishes to take his cases to trial, he has not had the \nopportunity to talk to his attorneys about the charges against him, the facts of his case, or \nwhether it would be possible to negotiate a better plea. \n170.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Yaw’s attorneys have conducted no \nindependent investigation into the facts surrounding Mr. Yaw’s case or the existence of any valid \ndefenses that might have been available to him. \n  40\n\n171.  The State of New York has not provided Mr. Yaw with the representation to \nwhich he is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as he was not represented at all critical \nstages; was deprived of consistent, vertical representation; has not had sufficient opportunity to \ndiscuss his case with his attorney, to participate in building a defense to the charges against him, \nor to make informed decisions about the progress and disposition of his case; and has been \ndeprived of investigative assistance, motions practice and vigorous advocacy that may contribute \nto a favorable resolution of his charges and/or an end to unnecessary incarceration.  Upon \ninformation and belief, the State of New York will continue to fail to provide Mr. Yaw with the \nlegal representation to which he is entitled as his case proceeds. \n172.  The representation provided to Mr. Yaw is illustrative of the pattern of \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants in the Counties and results from the structural and \nsystemic failings that led the Kaye Commission to conclude that New York State is failing to \nmeet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, including the \nabsence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate funding of the current \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed public defense system.   \n \nLuther Woodrow of Booker, Jr. (Suffolk County) \n173.  Luther Woodrow of Booker, Jr. was arrested on September 28, 2007 and charged \nwith criminal possession of stolen property in the fourth degree, a class E felony.  He faces a \nmaximum sentence of four years of imprisonment, as well as fines of up to $5000. \n174.  Mr. Booker was arraigned on September 29, 2007, at the Suffolk County District \nCourt in Central Islip.  Bail was set at $1000 bond, which Mr. Booker could not afford, causing \nhim to remain in jail.  Mr. Booker’s attorney did not advocate for lower bail. \n  41\n\n175.  At his next court appearance, on October 2, 2007, Mr. Booker was represented by \na different Legal Aid attorney.  Mr. Booker met with this second attorney for five minutes \nimmediately before his scheduled court appearance.  This meeting took place in the inmate \nholding area, in full hearing of correctional officers and other inmates.  Although Mr. Booker \nstill sought a reduction in bail to enable him to return to his job and family, his second attorney, \nlike the first, did not file a bail reduction motion.   \n176.  Mr. Booker had no other contact with his second attorney until his October 16, \n2007, court appearance.  Prior to that appearance, Mr. Booker again met with his second attorney \nfor less than five minutes in the holding area. \n177.  During the court appearance on October 16, Mr. Booker’s second attorney waived \nhis right to file a motion under CPL § 180.80 without having discussed the issue with him or \nreceived his consent.  Mr. Booker signed the waiver in open court without being told what he \nwas signing or the consequences of such a waiver.  At the time of signing, Mr. Booker did not \nknow what type of document he was signing and felt confused and pressured to sign it. \n178.  After waiving his right to release, Mr. Booker’s second attorney informed him, in \nopen court, that the best Mr. Booker could hope for would be the prosecutor’s offer of eight \nmonths of jail time.  Mr. Booker felt he had no alternative but to enter a guilty plea and, in open \ncourt, agreed to do so.  The judge then questioned Mr. Booker and, when Mr. Booker \npersistently maintained his innocence despite having just entered a guilty plea, withdrew and \nvoided the plea.  Mr. Booker’s second attorney told him that she would meet with him in the \nholding area after the proceeding to discuss what had happened with respect to his voided guilty \nplea. Mr. Booker waited but she never returned. \n  42\n\n179.  When Mr. Booker subsequently attempted to reach his second attorney from the \njail, the Legal Aid office informed him that he was being assigned a new, third attorney.  Mr. \nBooker asked if he could speak with this new attorney but was told that Legal Aid was yet not \nsure who the new attorney would be. \n180.  Still having no idea who his new attorney was, Mr. Booker appeared in court for a \nscheduled appearance on October 22, 2007.  Mr. Booker’s case was adjourned because no Legal \nAid attorney appeared in court that day to represent him, and he returned to jail. \n181.  The next day, Mr. Booker was brought to court again and met his third attorney \nfor minutes before his scheduled court appearance.  Like his other attorney meetings, this one \ntook place in the holding area, in full hearing of correctional officers and other inmates, and \nlasted only a few minutes.  In court that day, presented with no other options and without \nunderstanding the full, collateral consequences of his plea, Mr. Booker accepted the same plea \noffer he had rejected at his prior court appearance and entered a plea of guilty. \n182.  Upon information and belief, none of Mr. Booker’s attorneys conducted any \nindependent investigation into the facts surrounding Mr. Booker’s case or the existence of any \nvalid defenses that might have been available. \n183.  Mr. Booker is scheduled to be sentenced on November 20, 2007.  Mr. Booker has \nnot had any contact with any of his attorneys since he entered his guilty plea on October 23, \n2007, and no attorney has contacted him to prepare him for sentencing. \n184.  Because he has been incarcerated for almost two months awaiting resolution of \nhis charges, Mr. Booker has not been able to provide necessary financial and emotional support \nto his pregnant live-in girlfriend and her six young children. \n  43\n\n185.  The State of New York has failed to provide Mr. Booker with the representation \nto which he is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as he has been deprived of consistent, \nvertical representation; and has not had sufficient opportunity to discuss his case with his \nattorneys, to participate in building a defense to the charges against him, or to make informed \ndecisions about the progress and disposition of his case.  Upon information and belief, the State \nof New York will continue to fail to provide Mr. Booker with the legal representation to which \nhe is entitled as his case proceeds. \n186.  The representation provided to Mr. Booker is illustrative of the pattern of \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants in the Counties and results from the structural and \nsystemic failings that led the Kaye Commission to conclude that New York State is failing to \nmeet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, including the \nabsence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate funding of the current \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed public defense system.   \n \nEdward Kaminski (Suffolk County) \n \n187.  Edward Kaminski was arrested on December 11, 2006, and charged with grand \nlarceny in the fourth degree, a felony.  The maximum sentence that he faces is four years \nimprisonment and fines of up to $5000. \n188.  Mr. Kaminski was assigned a Legal Aid attorney on March 20, 2007, after he ran \nout of funds to pay for his private attorney.  Mr. Kaminski’s first contact with his Legal Aid \nattorney was for less than five minutes in the public hallway outside the court room before an \nappearance.   \n  44\n\n189.  Following this brief meeting, Mr. Kaminski never saw, spoke with, or \ncommunicated with his attorney except during scheduled court appearances or in the public \nhallway outside the courtroom for less than five minutes prior to court appearances. \n190.  At a court appearance on May 15, 2007, Mr. Kaminski was informed that he \nwould be assigned to a different Legal Aid attorney.  Neither the court nor his new attorney \noffered any explanation for the reassignment. \n191.  On September 19, 2007, Mr. Kaminski was assigned to a third Legal Aid \nattorney.  Mr. Kaminski was dismayed because he felt he had developed a relationship with his \nsecond attorney and had been satisfied with and confident in that attorney’s representation.  Once \nagain, no explanation for the reassignment was offered.  As with both of his previous attorneys, \nMr. Kaminski only met with his third attorney for less than five minutes outside the court room \nin the public hallway, in front of other defendants, immediately prior to his court appearance.  \nUpon information and belief, Mr. Kaminski’s new attorney had not had time to review Mr. \nKaminski’s case file and familiarize himself with the status of his case.  At the appearance, Mr. \nKaminski’s attorney requested an adjournment. \n192.  Mr. Kaminski missed his October 15, 2007, court date.  Shortly afterward, Mr. \nKaminski’s first attorney – not his present attorney – wrote him a letter informing him that a \nbench warrant had been issued due to Mr. Kaminski’s non-appearance. \n193.  At his next court date, on October 30, 2007, Mr. Kaminski approached both his \nfirst and his third Legal Aid attorneys in the hope of clearing up his confusion about who was \nrepresenting him.  Mr. Kaminski was not alone in his confusion, as his third Legal Aid attorney \nconfessed that he did not know who Mr. Kaminski’s attorney was at the time and stated that the \nLegal Aid office is in “chaos.” \n  45\n\n194.  At that court appearance, on October 30, the judge presented Mr. Kaminski with a \npre-trial order stating that, due to his non-cooperation with the Legal Aid Society, his right to \ncourt-appointed counsel had been waived.  Mr. Kaminski believes that the large number of \nadjournments on his case due to the constant changing of Legal Aid attorneys gave the court the \nmisperception that he was not cooperating with them.  However, upon information and belief, his \nattorneys sought adjournments most often to compensate for their lack of preparation.  Mr. \nKaminski is currently without a lawyer.  His trial is scheduled for November 29, 2007. \n195.  The stress caused by the confusion and prolonged adjudication of his case has \naffected Mr. Kaminski’s health.  He has lost fifteen pounds since he was charged and often has \ntrouble sleeping at night. Mr. Kaminski has missed necessary medical appointments to treat his \nneuropathy and Hepatitis C because the dates often conflict with required court appearances. He \nhas also been unable to visit and care for his elderly mother who suffers from dementia. \n196.  The State of New York has failed to provide Mr. Kaminski with the \nrepresentation to which he is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as he has been wrongly \ndenied his right to counsel; has been deprived of the ability to develop a meaningful attorney-\nclient relationship and to have representation at every critical stage due to lack of consistent \nrepresentation; and does not understand where his case stands or what work has been done on it \nwhile on the verge of going to trial as a pro se litigant. Upon information and belief, the State of \nNew York will continue to fail to provide Mr. Kaminski with the legal representation to which \nhe is entitled as his case proceeds. \n197.  The representation provided to Mr. Kaminski is illustrative of the pattern of \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants in the Counties and results from the structural and \nsystemic failings that led the Kaye Commission to conclude that New York State is failing to \n  46\n\nmeet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, including the \nabsence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate funding of the current \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed public defense system.   \n \nJoy Metzler (Suffolk County) \n198.  Joy Metzler was arrested on October 16, 2007, and charged with petit larceny, a \nmisdemeanor.  The maximum sentence she faces is one year in jail, as well as fines up to $1000. \n199.  Ms. Metzler saw her attorney for the first time in open court during arraignment.  \nBail was set at $1000 cash or $3000 bond, which Ms. Metzler could not afford, causing her to \nremain in jail for seven days until her brother was able to raise money and post bail.  Ms. \nMetzler’s attorney took no action to advocate for lower bail and, as a result of her incarceration, \nshe lost her new job.  She is unsure how her family, including her brother and his three children \nwho depend on her income, will now get by. \n200.  At her next court appearance, on October 22, 2007, Ms. Metzler was represented \nby a second Legal Aid attorney.  This attorney met with Ms. Metzler for a few minutes prior to \nthe court appearance in the holding area, in full hearing of correctional officers and other \ninmates.  Since then, Ms. Metzler has not seen or heard from her attorney and remains unsure of \nthe status of her case. \n201.  Upon information and belief, neither of Ms. Metzler’s attorneys conducted any \nindependent investigation into the facts surrounding Ms. Metzler’s case or the existence of any \nvalid defenses that might have been available. \n202.  The State of New York has failed to provide Ms. Metzler with the legal \nrepresentation to which she is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as she has not been \n  47\n\nprovided with consistent, vertical representation; has not had sufficient opportunity to discuss her \ncase with her attorney, to participate in building a defense to the charges against her, or to make \ninformed decisions about the progress and disposition of her case; and was subjected to \nunnecessary incarceration.  Upon information and belief, the State of New York will continue to \nfail to provide Ms. Metzler with the legal representation to which she is entitled as her case \nproceeds. \n203.  The representation provided to Ms. Metzler is illustrative of the pattern of \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants in the Counties and results from the structural and \nsystemic failings that led the Kaye Commission to conclude that New York State is failing to \nmeet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, including the \nabsence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate funding of the current \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed public defense system. \n \nVictor Turner (Suffolk County) \n204.  Victor Turner was arrested on August 18, 2007, and charged with criminal \npossession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree and resisting arrest, both \nmisdemeanors, and disorderly conduct, a violation.  Mr. Turner also faces another misdemeanor \npossession of a controlled substance charge from an earlier incident in 2006.  The maximum \nsentence Mr. Turner faces is six years imprisonment, as well as fines of up to $7250. \n205.  Legal Aid began its representation of Mr. Turner on or around January of 2007, \nwhen he ran out of funds to pay the private attorney he has been able to retain on his 2006 \ncharge.  Since that time, Mr. Turner’s case has been handled by at least four different Legal Aid \nattorneys.  During the first seven months of his representation by Legal Aid, he was represented \n  48\n\nby a different attorney at each court appearance.  His current attorney has been handling his case \nfor four months. \n206.  Mr. Turner’s only meetings with his various attorneys have taken place at the \ncourthouse immediately before or during scheduled court appearances.  Each of these meetings \nlasted less than five minutes and took place in the hallway or other public areas of the courtroom, \nin full hearing of correctional officers and other defendants.   \n207.  Mr. Turner has repeatedly refused to accept a plea offer urged on him by both the \nprosecutor and his own attorneys.  Each time, Mr. Turner’s attorneys have responded to his \nrefusal by requesting an adjournment of his case, whereupon the prosecutor and Mr. Turner’s \nnext attorney would simply present the same plea bargain to him again at the next court \nappearance. \n208.  Mr. Turner has never spoken with or seen any of his attorneys except in court. \nDuring the first ten months of his representation by Legal Aid, he did not even have contact \ninformation for Legal Aid and was unable to ask questions or get updates about the status of his \ncase.  Mr. Turner eventually received a business card with his current attorney’s contact \ninformation during his October 19, 2007, court appearance, ten months after he was assigned to \nbe represented by Legal Aid. \n209.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Turner’s attorneys have conducted no \nindependent investigation of the facts underlying his charges or any possible defenses that may \nbe available to him.  Mr. Turner is concerned that witnesses who could support his defense may \ndisappear because the incident underlying his arrest occurred over one year ago. \n210.  The prolonging of Mr. Turner’s case over the past year has made it difficult for \nhim to hold down a job because he must constantly request days off for court appearances.  As a \n  49\n\nresult, Mr. Turner is unable to meet his child-support obligations to his young daughter.  Mr. \nTurner also lost his car, making it even more difficult to hold down a job and make his monthly \ncourt appearances. \n211.  Mr. Turner’s next court appearances are scheduled for November 16, 2007, and \nNovember 30, 2007.  His attorneys have yet to explain the purpose of these appearances or \nprepare him for them. \n212.  The State of New York has failed to provide Mr. Turner with the representation to \nwhich he is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as he has not been provided with \nconsistent, vertical representation; has not had sufficient opportunity to discuss his case with his \nattorneys, to participate in building a defense to the charges against him, or to make informed \ndecisions about the progress and disposition of his case; has been deprived of appropriate \ninvestigative assistance, motions practice and vigorous advocacy that may have contributed to a \nfavorable resolution of the charges; and does not understand where his case stands or the status \nof the charges against him.  Upon information and belief, the State of New York will continue to \nfail to provide Mr. Turner with the legal representation to which he is entitled as his case \nproceeds. \n213.  The representation provided to Mr. Turner is illustrative of the pattern of \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants in the Counties and results from the structural and \nsystemic failings that led the Kaye Commission to conclude that New York State is failing to \nmeet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, including the \nabsence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate funding of the current \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed public defense system. \n \n  50\n\nCandace Brookins (Washington County) \n214.  Candace Brookins was arrested on October 15, 2007, and charged with five \ncounts of forgery in the second degree, a felony, five counts of criminal possession of a forged \ninstrument in the second degree, also a felony, and one count of petit larceny, a misdemeanor.  \nMs. Brookins faces a maximum sentence of twenty years in prison, as well as fines of up to \n$51,000. \n215.  Ms. Brookins has a four-year-old daughter whom Ms. Brookins’s mother is taking \ncare of while Ms. Brookins is incarcerated.  If Ms. Brookins were sentenced to the statutory \nmaximum, she would not be released until her daughter was twenty-four, losing all opportunity \nto raise and parent her. \n216.  Ms. Brookins has only spoken to her attorney once over the phone and once \nimmediately prior to a court appearance on October 16, 2007, when her attorney spoke to her \nwhile a corrections officer was only feet away, with no apparent concern for confidentiality.  Ms. \nBrookins’s attorney has not provided her with a copy of her court files or the investigative files \nfor her case.   \n217.  Upon information and belief, Ms. Brookins’s attorney has conducted no \nindependent investigation into the facts surrounding Ms. Brookins’s case or the existence of any \npossible defenses that may be available to her   \n218.  Ms. Brookins is currently represented by the same attorney who represented a \nwitness in Ms. Brookins’s case when that witness was initially charged with the crime with \nwhich Ms. Brookins now stands accused, a clear conflict of interest.  The witness had been \ncharged with crimes derived from passing bad checks, but, represented by Ms. Brookins’s \ncurrent attorney, defended herself by claiming that Ms. Brookins had in fact written the checks \n  51\n\nwithout her permission.  The charges against the witness were dropped, and charges were \nsubsequently filed against Ms. Brookins based on the witness’s statements.     \n219.  Ms. Brookins had a court hearing on October 30, 2007.  Upon information and \nbelief, her case was adjourned pending indictment.  She remains incarcerated.  \n220.  The State of New York has failed to provide Ms. Brookins with the representation \nto which she is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as she has not had sufficient \nopportunity to discuss her case with her attorney, to participate in building a defense to the \ncharges against her, or to make informed decisions about the progress and disposition of her \ncase; and has not been provided with an attorney who is free from conflicts concerning her case. \nUpon information and belief, the State of New York will continue to fail to provide Ms. \nBrookins with the legal representation to which she is entitled as her case proceeds. \n221.  The representation provided to Ms. Brookins is illustrative of the pattern of \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants in the Counties and results from the structural and \nsystemic failings that led the Kaye Commission to conclude that New York State is failing to \nmeet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, including the \nabsence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate funding of the current \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed public defense system.   \n \nRandy Habshi (Washington County) \n222.  Randy Habshi was arrested on July 26, 2007, and charged with burglary in the \nsecond degree, a felony.  He faces a maximum sentence of fifteen years of imprisonment, as well \nas fines of up to $15,000.  \n  52\n\n223.  At arraignment, Mr. Habshi was not represented by counsel.  Bail was set at \n$100,000 cash or $200,000 bond, which he could not afford.  \n224.  Without any meaningful conversations with his attorney and without fully \nunderstanding the nature of the waiver, on August 1, 2007, Mr. Habshi waived his preliminary \nexamination based on his attorney’s instruction.     \n225.  For over two months, between August and October, Mr. Habshi never saw or \nspoke with his attorney outside of court appearances, despite Mr. Habshi’s repeated attempts to \ncontact his attorney.  At a court appearance on October 10, 2007, Mr. Habshi’s attorney did not \nshow up.  The next day, Mr. Habshi’s attorney visited him in jail for a few minutes solely to \ndeliver the prosecutor’s plea offer.  \n226.  Mr. Habshi’s official criminal record contains what he believes to be a mistake, \nbut his attorney has provided him no opportunity to discuss the mistake or the possibility of \nclearing it up.  This potential error, a plea to a misdemeanor that is currently recorded as a \nfelony, could make a substantial difference in sentencing if Mr. Habshi were to plead guilty or be \nfound guilty after trial.  The prosecutor’s plea offer reflects the possibly mistaken premise that \nMr. Habshi has a previous felony conviction. \n227.  Mr. Habshi has taken advantage of his time in jail to break several addictions.  He \nhas completed a GED course and is awaiting the results of his examination.  Nevertheless, Mr. \nHabshi’s attorney has failed to speak with him concerning any details of his life which might \nbecome relevant at sentencing, should Mr. Habshi plead guilty or be found guilty after trial.    \n228.  The State of New York has failed to provide Mr. Habshi with the representation \nto which he is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as he had insufficient opportunity to \ndiscuss his case with his attorney, to participate in building a defense to the charges against him, \n  53\n\nand to make informed decisions about the progress and disposition of his case.  Mr. Habshi has \nalso been deprived of alternatives to incarceration that would offer him effective treatment for \nhis past drug addictions. Upon information and belief, the State of New York will continue to fail \nto provide Mr. Habshi with the legal representation to which he is entitled as his case proceeds. \n229.  The representation provided to Mr. Habshi is illustrative of the pattern of \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants in the Counties and results from the structural and \nsystemic failings that led the Kaye Commission to conclude that New York State is failing to \nmeet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, including the \nabsence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate funding of the current \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed public defense system.   \n \nRonald McIntyre (Washington County) \n230.  Ronald McIntyre was arrested on October 24, 2005, and charged with grand \nlarceny in the fourth degree, a felony.  He faces a maximum sentence of seven years of \nimprisonment, as well as fines of up to $5,000.  \n231.  On December 20, 2005, Mr. McIntyre notified the court that he had attempted to \ncontact his public defense attorney several times to ascertain the date of his next court hearing, \nbut the public defender had not returned his calls.  Mr. McIntyre’s court file contains no \nindication that the court responded to his request for information concerning his next court date.  \nBecause of his attorney’s failure to inform him of his court date, Mr. McIntyre then missed his \ncourt date on January 17, 2006.  A bench warrant was issued for Mr. McIntyre’s arrest, and he \nwas re-arrested and remanded to jail on August 14, 2007. \n  54\n\n232.  Mr. McIntyre was assigned a new attorney following his re-arrest.  He spoke with \nthis attorney for only one or two minutes at two separate court appearances.   \n233.  Mr. McIntyre has now been assigned a third attorney.  Mr. McIntyre has had no \ncontact with this third attorney and has not been able to discuss the strategic ramifications of \ntestifying before the grand jury with any attorney.   \n234.  As of the filing of this complaint, Mr. McIntyre has been incarcerated for nearly \nthree months and does not understand what is happening with his case or whether he has been \nindicted.  \n235.  The State of New York has failed to provide Mr. McIntyre with the representation \nto which he is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as he has been denied consistent, \nvertical representation, hampering his attempts to explain his case to an attorney and his hopes of \nreceiving substantive representation; and has had insufficient opportunity to discuss his case with \nhis attorney, to participate in building a defense to those charges, or to make informed decisions \nabout the progress and disposition of his case.  Upon information and belief, the State of New \nYork will continue to fail to provide Mr. McIntyre with the legal representation to which he is \nentitled as his case proceeds. \n236.  The representation provided to Mr. McIntyre is illustrative of the pattern of \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants in the Counties and results from the structural and \nsystemic failings that led the Kaye Commission to conclude that New York State is failing to \nmeet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, including the \nabsence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate funding of the current \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed public defense system.   \n \n  55\n\nThe Right to Counsel in New York State \n \n237.  The right to counsel is firmly established in New York State and has been since \nthe Legislature passed section 308 of the Criminal Procedure Law in 1881.  Indeed, the \nConstitution and laws of New York provide far more extensive protections in this area than \nfederal constitutional law provides.  See, e.g., People v. Settles, 46 N.Y.2d 154, 161 (1978) (“So \nvalued is the right to counsel in this State … it has developed independent of its Federal \ncounterpart ….  Thus, we have extended the protections afforded by our State Constitution \nbeyond those of the Federal – well before certain Federal rights were recognized.”); People v. \nArthur, 22 N.Y.2d 325, 328 (1968) (noting that the broad right to counsel in New York requires \nexclusion of confession taken after attorney request and was denied access to client, though \nfederal law may not); People v. Benevento, 91 N.Y.2d 708, 714 (1998) (rejecting the more \nrestrictive “harmless error” test applied to federal claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and \napplying a more flexible standard); People v. Krom, 61 N.Y.2d 187, 197 (1984) (explaining that, \nin contrast to federal law, the right to counsel in New York does not permit law enforcement to \nquestion a suspect after invocation of right to counsel even if the suspect initiates conversation).   \n238.  In 1965, the Court of Appeals further expanded the right to counsel in People v. \nWitenski, which held that indigent defendants in all criminal cases, not merely in felony \nprosecutions, are entitled to have counsel appointed to represent them.  15 N.Y.2d 392, 395 \n(1965).  The Court of Appeals observed that the “right and the duty of our courts, to assign \ncounsel for the defense of destitute persons, indicted for crime, has been, by long and uniform \npractice, as firmly incorporated into the law of the State, as if it were made imperative by express \nenactment.”  Id. at 397 (internal quotation omitted).  The Court also noted that in New York \n  56\n\nState “the right of counsel must be made ‘meaningful and effective’ in criminal courts on every \nlevel.”  Id. at 395.   \n239.  That same year, the Court of Appeals held in People v. Hughes, that an indigent \ndefendant “who is by statute accorded an absolute right to appeal … is entitled to the assignment \nof counsel to represent him on such appeal if he so requests.”  15 N.Y.2d 172 (1965).   It is \nequally well established that this right requires “meaningful and effective” assistance of assigned \nappellate counsel.  Id. at 173. \n240.  Accordingly, under the Constitution and laws of New York, as well as the \nConstitution of the United States, the obligation to provide meaningful and effective assistance \nof counsel to indigent defendants in all criminal court proceedings rests with the State. \n \nThe State’s Abdication of Responsibility for Public Defense Services to the Counties \n \n241.  In 1965, to meet constitutional mandates, the Legislature adopted Article 18-B of \nthe New York County Law, requiring each of New York’s 62 counties to establish its own plan \nfor providing indigent criminal defendants with legal representation.  Article 18-B offers \ncounties the option of creating a public defense system using one of three methods, or a \ncombination thereof: (1) establishing county public defender offices; (2) contracting with a \nprivate legal aid society; or (3) using a panel of private assigned counsel.   \n242.  Onondaga County relies solely on an assigned counsel system to provide public \ndefense services to criminal defendants.  The assigned counsel program is administered by the \nOnondaga County Bar Association under contract with the county government. \n243.  Ontario County also relies solely on an assigned counsel system, administered by \nthe Ontario County Bar Association, to provide public defense services to criminal defendants.   \n  57\n\n244.  Schuyler County relies on a county public defender office to provide public \ndefense services to criminal defendants.  The Schuyler County public defender office consists of \na Chief Public Defender and one part-time assistant public defender.  The county maintains a \ncontract with a private attorney from an adjacent county to handle most cases in which the public \ndefender cannot represent the client due to a conflict of interest; any additional conflicts cases \nare distributed among a small number of assigned counsel.  \n245.  Suffolk County contracts with a legal aid society to provide the majority of its \npublic defense services, with a smaller number of conflicts cases handled by assigned counsel.  \nThe Suffolk County Legal Aid Society consists of approximately 60 full-time attorneys who staff \ntwo offices, one in the eastern part of the county and another in the western part.  \n246.  Washington County relies on a county public defender office to provide public \ndefense services to criminal defendants.  The Washington County public defender office consists \nof one part-time Chief Public Defender and three additional part-time assistant public defenders.  \nConflict cases are handled by assigned counsel. \n \nThe Lack of Enforceable, Statewide Standards \n247.  Unlike the vast majority of the rest of the country, New York State has \nestablished no enforceable standards for the provision of public defense services by which the \nquality of representation can be measured and guaranteed.  Thus, there is no mechanism for \nmeasuring whether constitutionally adequate counsel is being provided to indigent defendants \nand for insuring against disparities in the quality of representation by mere happenstance of \ngeographic location.  \n  58\n\n248.  The American Bar Association (ABA), the National Legal Aid and Defender \nAssociation (NLADA), the National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and \nGoals (NAC), the New York State Defenders Association (NYSDA), and the New York State \nBar Association (NYSBA) have all promulgated standards reflecting a general consensus for \nmeasuring the quality of defense services.  See, e.g., ABA Standards for Criminal Justice: \nProviding Defense Services (3d ed. 1992); ABA Ten Principles of a Public Defense Delivery \nSystem (2002); ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Providing Defense Services (3d ed. 1992); \nNLADA Guidelines for Negotiating and Awarding Governmental Contracts for Criminal \nDefense Services (1984); NLADA, Standards for the Administration of Assigned Counsel \nSystems (1989); NAC Report of the Task Force on Courts (1973); NYSDA, Standards for \nProviding Constitutionally and Statutorily Mandated Representation in New York State (2004); \nNYSBA, Standards for Providing Mandated Representation (2005). \n249.  None of these standards are enforced by the State. \nThe Lack of State Supervision and Oversight \n250.  Article 18-B delegates to the counties responsibility for providing meaningful and \neffective representation in criminal proceedings to people who cannot afford private lawyers.  \nThe State exercises no meaningful supervision or oversight of the provision of public defense \nservices.   \n251.  No state agency or office exists for the purpose of monitoring or evaluating the \nquality of representation provided under the counties’ chosen plans for providing public defense.   \n252.  Although the Office of the State Comptroller requires each county to submit an \nannual report in order to qualify for state funding for public defense services, no state agency or \nofficer reviews these forms for the purpose of evaluating whether the counties’ systems meet \n  59\n\nconstitutional standards for representation.  A county’s system is only evaluated by the \nComptroller’s office if the annual report reflects a reduction in local expenditures from the \nprevious year, in which case the county may still qualify for state funds if they demonstrate a \n“maintenance of effort” to provide public defense services. \n253.  Counties often provide inaccurate or incomplete information in their annual \nreports.  In past years, several counties have failed to complete any report at all.   \nThe Lack of Adequate State Funds for Public Defense Services \n254.  Article 18-B places the financial burden on the counties to provide public defense \nservices.  The result, according to the Kaye Commission Report, is that “[t]he amount of monies \ncurrently allocated within the State of New York for the provision of constitutionally-mandated \nindigent criminal defense is grossly inadequate.”  \n255.  In 2003, responding to a court ruling, the Legislature raised the rates of \ncompensation for private assigned counsel lawyers (known as 18-B lawyers) and created the \nIndigent Legal Services Fund (“ILSF”) to provide, for the first time, some state funding to \ncompensate for the additional county expenditures required to cover the increase in 18-B rates.   \n256.  Despite the creation of the ILSF, state funding remains a very small percentage of \nthe overall cost of public defense services in the counties and does not ensure adequate funding \nlevels.  In all but one county, state funds in 2006 accounted for one-quarter or less of the total \ncosts of providing public defense services.  In many counties, state funds constituted only 15% \nof overall public defense expenditures.  Across the state, state funds accounted for 18% of total \nspending on public defense, with counties bearing the burden for most of the remaining costs. \n257.  As the Kaye Commission notes, the State’s failure to provide adequate funding \n“imposes a large unfunded mandate by the state upon its counties [that] results in a very uneven \n  60\n\ndistribution of services and compromises the independence of defense providers.” The Kaye \nCommission concludes that the funding system “results in an inadequate and in many respects an \nunconstitutional level of representation and creates significant disparities in the quality of \nrepresentation based on no factor other than geography, thereby impugning the fairness of New \nYork’s criminal justice system.”  \n \n     The Kaye Commission on the Future of Indigent Defense’s Indictment of New York’s Public \nDefense System \n \n258.  A comprehensive indictment of New York’s public defense system came in June \n2006, when the Kaye Commission on the Future of Indigent Defense released a report \nconcluding that “the indigent defense system in New York State is both severely dysfunctional \nand structurally incapable of providing each poor defendant with the effective legal \nrepresentation that he or she is guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States and the \nConstitution and laws of the State of New York …. [and] has resulted in a disparate, inequitable, \nand ineffective system for securing constitutional guarantees to those too poor to obtain counsel \nof their own choosing.”  \n259.  The Kaye Commission was convened in May 2004 by Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye \nand, according to Judge Kaye’s State of the Judiciary Address earlier that year, was charged with \n“examin[ing] the effectiveness of indigent criminal defense services across the State, and \nconsider[ing] alternative models of assigning, supervising and financing assigned counsel \ncompatible with New York’s constitutional and fiscal realities.”  Chaired by William E. \nHellerstein and the Honorable Burton B. Roberts, the Kaye Commission consisted of 30 \nmembers representing each of New York’s twelve judicial districts and included prominent \nprosecutors, defense attorneys and judges. \n  61\n\n260.  The Kaye Commission conducted four public hearings (in New York City, \nAlbany, Rochester and Ithaca), with testimony from 93 individuals and groups from across the \nState, including public defenders, private defense lawyers, assigned counsel plan administrators, \njudges, prosecutors, experts in public defense, bar association representatives, members of the \ncivil rights community, representatives of community groups, and criminal defendants and their \nfamilies.   \n261.  The Kaye Commission also drew extensively on the factual findings of its \nconsultant, The Spangenberg Group, which, according to the Kaye Commission, “is a nationally \nand internationally recognized criminal justice research and consulting firm that specializes in \nresearch concerning indigent defense services.”  The Spangenberg Group collected and analyzed \ndata from each of New York’s 62 counties and conducted independent site work in 22 counties \nspecifically selected to be geographically and demographically representative of the entire State.  \nThe Spangenberg Group’s findings were presented to the Kaye Commission in an April 5, 2006, \nreport entitled Status of Indigent Defense in New York.  According to the Kaye Commission, the \nSpangenberg Group’s report represents “the most comprehensive study of indigent defense \nrepresentation ever undertaken in New York State.”  \n262.  Based on the facts uncovered by the Spangenberg Group and on the hearings it \nconducted, the Kaye Commission concluded that “New York’s current fragmented system of \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed indigent defense services fails to satisfy the state’s \nconstitutional and statutory obligations to protect the rights of the indigent accused.”  \n263.  The Kaye Commission’s “ultimate conclusion,” based on all the information \npresented to it, was “that the delivery system most likely to guarantee quality representation to \nthose entitled to it is a statewide defender system that is truly independent, is entirely and \n  62\n\nadequately state-funded, and is one in which those providing indigent defense services are \nemployees of entities within the defender system or are participants in an assigned counsel plan \nthat has been approved by the body established to administer the statewide defender system.” \nFurther, the Commission noted that “[a]dequate funding of indigent criminal defense must be \nprovided by the New York Legislature from the State’s General Fund, not from the counties.”  \n \nNew York State’s Long History of Violating the Right to Counsel for Indigent Defendants \n \n264.  The Kaye Commission report is only the latest in a long line of indictments of \nNew York’s public defense system.  The State has never fully lived up to its obligation to \nprovide meaningful and effective assistance of counsel to all indigent defendants facing criminal \ncharges, though it has long known that its obligation was not being met.  There is a decades-long \nhistory of indictments levied against New York’s fractured public defense system.  \n265.  As far back as 1967, the New York State Bar Association conducted a seminar \naddressing the absence of standards for ensuring quality representation and the lack of guidelines \nfor determining eligibility, utilizing investigators and experts, and establishing the scope of \nrepresentation.  Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, the New York State Defenders \nAssociation published a series of reports and testified before numerous bodies decrying the crisis \nin public defense funding.  In 1994, the New York County Lawyers Association established a \ntask force to study the issue and, the following year, urged the immediate creation of a Board of \nTrustees for Indigent Defense to oversee and secure the professional independence of defender \norganizations in New York City.      \n266.  In 1997, the New York County Lawyers’ Association’s Task Force on the \nRepresentation of the Indigent issued a report declaring that the rates of compensation for \n  63\n\nassigned counsel were inadequate and “inconsistent with New York’s commitment to equal \njustice.” NYCLA, Task Force on the Representation of the Indigent, Assigned Counsel \nCompensation Committee (1997). \n267.  In 2000, the Unified Court System issued a report, Assigned Counsel \nCompensation in New York: A Growing Crisis, which focused on the problem created by low \nrates for assigned counsel.  The report concluded not only that rates should be increased, but also \nthat the State must share the cost of assigned counsel compensation, establish a statewide review \nprocess for reviewing rates, and implement statewide eligibility standards. \n268.  In March 2001, after holding extensive hearings, the Appellate Division, First \nDepartment’s Committee on Legal Representation of the Poor issued a report entitled Crisis in \nthe Legal Representation of the Poor: Recommendations for a Revised Plan to Implement \nMandated Funded Legal Representation of Persons Who Cannot Afford Counsel.  The report \nconcluded that “[t]he entire system by which poor people are provided legal representation is in \ncrisis” and that the major causes of the crisis included “lack of resources, support and respect, \n[and] inadequate funding of institutional providers combined with ever-increasing caseloads.”  \nThe Committee called on the State “to reconsider the entire legislative structure relating to \ngovernmentally funded legal representation of the poor.” \n269.  Also in 2001, the New York State Defenders’ Association issued a report, \nResolving the Assigned Counsel Fee Crisis: An Opportunity to Provide County Fiscal Relief and \nQuality Public Defense Services.  The report went beyond the call for raising assigned counsel \nrates and called for the creation of “an independent and politically insulated statewide Public \nDefense Commission that would oversee both the distribution of state funds and the provision of \n  64\n\ndefense services,” as well as the creation of enforceable, statewide standards for both eligibility \ndeterminations and evaluating service providers. \n270.  In April 2001, the New York Times published a three-part series on New York \nCity’s public defense system.  An April 12, 2001, editorial accompanying the series noted that its \ndescription of the system raised a real question of “whether many defendants are getting the legal \nrepresentation to which they are entitled, or are receiving merely token representation to give \ntheir trials a veneer of constitutionality” and called for “a strong state role – preferably through a \npolitically insulated commission – in setting quality standards … and in exercising vigorous \noversight to make sure those standards are met.”  \n271.  In July 2001, the Committee for an Independent Public Defense Commission, \nchaired by Michael S. Whiteman, former counsel to Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller, declared \nthat the indigent defense system was on the verge of collapse and presented a bill to establish an \nindependent oversight commission.  \n272.  In 2003, New York County Lawyers’ Association successfully sued the State of \nNew York, alleging that the compensation scheme for assigned counsel violated the state and \nfederal constitutional right to meaningful and effective counsel.  In his decision, Supreme Court \nJustice Lucindo Suarez made the following factual findings regarding the provision of public \ndefense services across the State: \n  Too many assigned counsel do not: conduct a prompt and thorough    \n  interview of the defendant; consult with the defendant on a regular basis;    \n  examine the legal sufficiency of the complaint or indictment; seek the    \n  defendant’s prompt pre-trial release; retain investigators, social workers,    \n  or other experts where appropriate; file pretrial motions where      \n  appropriate; fully advise the defendant regarding any plea and only after    \n  conducting an investigation of the law and the facts; prepare for trial and    \n  court appearances; and engage in appropriate presentence advocacy,    \n  including seeking to obtain the defendant’s entry into any appropriate    \n  diversionary program. \n  65\n\n \nN.Y. County Lawyers Ass’n v. State, 196 Misc.2d 761, 774-75 (Sup. Ct. N.Y. County 2003). \n273.  In 2004, the inadequacies of New York’s public defense system were noticed on a \nnational level in the American Bar Association’s Report, Gideon’s Broken Promise.  The report \nnoted that New York failed to meet national standards regarding training for public defense \nservice providers, unconstitutionally restricted eligibility standards because of financial pressures \nto keep costs low, and in some parts of the state had “radically out of whack” caseloads ranging \nfrom 1200 to 1600 cases per attorney.  \n274.  Also in 2004, the NAACP Legal Defense & Education Fund released a report \nentitled The Status of Indigent Defense in Schuyler County concluding after four months of field \nwork that “the quality of public defense services … was extremely poor and fell short of state \nand federal constitutional, as well as professional standards for criminal defense.” \n275.  In 2005, the New York State Bar Association’s Special Committee to Ensure \nQuality of Mandated Representation released a report finding that public defense service \nproviders in New York “are under-funded and overworked to such an extent that they lack the \ntime or resources necessary to maintain and improve the quality of the representation they \nprovide.”  The report concluded that addressing New York’s public defense crisis required “the \ncreation of an independent public defense oversight mechanism empowered to provide oversight, \nquality assurance, support and resources to providers of mandated representation.” \n276.  As recently as August, 2007, a joint report of the National Legal Aid and \nDefender Association and the New York State Defender’s Association detailed the problems \nwith New York’s public defense system as they impacted Franklin County.  The report \nconcluded that, “[v]ictimized by an underfunded and fragmented system that violates national \nlegal standards and the state’s professed commitment to equal justice, Franklin County fails to \n  66\n\nprovide effective representation on behalf of the accused in criminal cases…. [L]eaving the task \nof funding public defense services to the counties – even in part – endangers a state’s entire \nability to dispense justice fairly.” \n277.  In light of the Kaye Commission Report, the Spangenberg Group Report and the \nnumerous reports and studies that preceded them, it is clear that the State has known of the \ndeficiencies in the State’s public defense system for many years.  The State’s failure to remedy \nthose deficiencies amounts to deliberate indifference to the constitutional and legal rights of \nindigent criminal defendants. \n \nThe Statewide Failure to Meet Basic Standards of Constitutional Legal Representation \n278.  As a result of the State’s failure to provide oversight, standards, and funding, \nindigent persons in New York State, including in the Counties, are not receiving, or are at severe \nand unacceptably high risk of not receiving, constitutionally and legally adequate representation, \nas measured by well-accepted national and state standards.  \n279.  There is a national consensus on both the requirements of meaningful and \neffective public defense delivery systems and the tasks public defense providers must undertake \nto provide constitutionally adequate legal representation.  This consensus is reflected in \nstandards for the provision of public defense services promulgated by the American Bar \nAssociation (ABA), the National Legal Aid and Defender Association (NLADA), the National \nAdvisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals (NAC), the New York State \nDefenders Association (NYSDA), and the New York State Bar Association (NYSBA). \n  67\n\n280.  The public defense system in New York does not live up to these basic standards. \nAs the Kaye Commission found, “New York’s indigent defense system does not even conform to \nthe American Bar Association’s Ten Principles of a Public Defense Delivery System.” \n281.  The public defense systems in the Counties suffer many symptoms of a broken \npublic defense system as measured by national and state standards, including: inadequate staffing \nresulting in no representation for some defendants, particularly in arraignments where bail \ndeterminations and other critical decisions are made; incoherent or excessively restrictive \neligibility standards that exclude indigent people from getting counsel; lack of attorney-client \nconsultation and communication impairing the ability to present and prepare a defense and \nadvocate for pre-trial release; a lack of hiring criteria, performance standards and supervisory \ncontrols resulting in a lack of meaningful and effective counsel; a lack of training resulting in \ninexperienced and inadequate counsel; a lack of resources for investigations and expert services \nwhere they are needed to present an adequate defense; overwhelming caseloads and/or \nworkloads that prevent attorneys from serving all their clients; a lack of vertical representation, \nsuch that different attorneys represent the same defendant at various stages, impairing the \ndevelopment of an attorney-client relationship, resulting in gaps in representation during critical \nphases, and depriving clients of lawyers who understand their case; a lack of independence from \njudicial, prosecutorial and political authorities that compromises the ability to provide adequate \nrepresentation; and inadequate resources and compensation, particularly as compared to \nprosecutorial personnel, resulting in poor quality representation.   \nInadequate Staffing and the Failure to Provide Representation to \n Indigent Defendants At All Critical Stages \n \n282.  Attorneys are not always available to represent each eligible defendant at every \ncritical stage of the criminal process, thus directly depriving defendants of the right to counsel.  \n  68\n\n283.  The Spangenberg Group’s report to the Kaye Commission found that public \ndefense service providers “in most counties across the state are not staffed sufficiently to cover \nall of the numerous dockets in their counties.”  Moreover, “some judges do not apply the law \n[requiring appointment of counsel] … out of fiscal concern ….”  \n284.  National and state standards for the administration of a public defense system \nrecognize that a defense attorney should be present at all critical stages of the prosecution, \nincluding arraignment.  See First Department Indigent Defense Organization Oversight \nCommittee, General Requirements for All Organized Providers of Defense Services to Indigent \nDefendants (1996), Performance Standard II; NLADA Guidelines for Legal Defense Systems in \nthe United States (1976), Guidelines I-1.2(a) & V-5.11; NLADA Performance Guidelines for \nCriminal Defense Representation (1995), Guidelines 1.1 & 3.1; NLADA Standards for the \nAdministration of Assigned Counsel Systems (1989), Standards 2.1(c) & 2.5(a); NYSDA, \nStandards for Providing Constitutionally and Statutorily Mandated Legal Representation in New \nYork State (2004), Standard V(A)(3); NYSBA Standards for Providing Mandated \nRepresentation (2005), Standard B-2. \n285.  The common practice of making bail determinations during arraignment makes \nthe presence of counsel even more critical at this stage.  In a 2007 study of non-felony cases in \nNew York City, the New York City Criminal Justice Agency found that higher rates of bail \ncorrelate with longer period of pretrial detention, and longer periods of pre-trial detention, even \ncontrolling for other factors, creates an increased likelihood of conviction.  The study suggests \nthat detained defendants may be less able to assist in building a defense and that detained \ndefendants may feel pressure to plead guilty in order to gain release.  See Mary D. Philips, Ph.D., \nBail, Detention, and Non-Felony Case Outcomes, CJA Research Brief (May 2007). Thus, the \n  69\n\nabsence of counsel to advocate for lower bail or alternatives to pretrial incarceration at \narraignment is particularly harmful. \n286.  In Onondaga County, for example, many defendants are not represented at \narraignments where crucial decisions about bail are made and pleas may be offered and accepted \nwithout benefit of advice from counsel.  Attorneys assigned to cover arraignments often do not \nhave the time or resources to interview all incarcerated defendants before arraignment, and if \ndefendants are not interviewed they are not represented.  Defendants who are not in custody are \nlargely not represented at arraignment at all. \n287.  In Ontario County, many defendants are unrepresented at arraignment, and bail \ndeterminations are regularly made without the benefit of representation or advocacy by counsel.  \nOne county justice reports that in the ten years he has been on the bench, he has only seen an \nattorney present at arraignment once.  Without the benefit of advocacy from counsel, bail may be \nset based on inappropriate factors.  For example, some judges frequently deny bail to \nunrepresented defendants who did not take a breathalyzer test at the time of an arrest for a DUI.  \n288.  In Schuyler County, defendants appear without attorneys at arraignments where, \nagain, bail determinations are often made.  Defendants are therefore unable to advocate for \nappropriate bail determinations and thus face unnecessary incarceration.   \n289.  In Washington County, nearly all defendants are unrepresented at arraignments \nand in the early stages of the criminal process. Defendants are sometimes pressured not to get \nlawyers by judges and prosecutors who offer a plea before counsel is assigned and imply that the \nplea offer will be withdrawn if the defendant waits for the appointment of counsel.  Defendants \nalso are unable to advocate for appropriate bail determinations and thus face unnecessary \nincarceration. \n  70\n\n290.  Many defendants who are unrepresented in critical proceedings plead guilty \nwithout the benefit of advice from counsel and without fully understanding the consequences of \ntheir plea.  Unrepresented defendants may be forced to negotiate with the district attorney and \nthe judge directly, without the benefit of advice and representation from counsel.   \n291.  Similarly, many defendants who are unrepresented in critical proceedings make \nincriminating statements that could prejudice their cases. In Schuyler County, for example, a \njudge stated to an unrepresented defendant charged accused of making false statements, “It says \nhere you lied to the police,” and the defendant, without counsel to advise him, confirmed that he \nhad done so.   \n292.  The Counties often fail to appoint counsel for defendants charged with lower-\nlevel offenses, in plain violation of the right to counsel.  In Suffolk County, for example, judges \noften deny counsel to a defendant because he or she is facing a violation charge, even though the \ndefendant is in custody or facing jail time.  \n293.  The deprivation of the right to counsel is particularly evident in the justice courts, \nalso known as “town and village” courts.  These courts handle by far the largest number of cases \nin the state’s criminal justice system, including violations, misdemeanors and the preliminary \nstages of felony prosecutions.  \n294.  The Kaye Commission found “that the deprivation of indigent defendants’ right to \ncounsel was widespread in Town and Village Courts.  Specifically, we learned that there are \nsignificant delays in the appointment of counsel, that many indigent defendants must negotiate \npleas with the prosecution while unrepresented, and that many justices themselves lack a clear \nunderstanding as to which cases trigger the right to counsel.  The Commission also learned that \n  71\n\nall too often counsel for indigent defendants are not available to attend the numerous Town and \nVillage Courts.”  \n295.  The institutional providers in Suffolk, Schuyler and Washington counties do not \nhave adequate staff to cover all the justice courts in their jurisdictions.  The assigned counsel \nprograms in Onondaga and Ontario do not have any system for ensuring that assigned counsel \nare available during critical proceedings in the justice courts.  As a result, eligible defendants go \nunrepresented at critical stages. \n296.  In Schuyler County, one part-time assistant public defender must cover all non-\nfelony cases in 11 justice courts, as well as paternity, child support, and drug treatment court \ncases.  In Washington County, three part-time assistant public defenders cover 24 justice courts, \nin addition to sharing the family court docket with the Chief Public Defender. \n297.  It is not uncommon in the Counties for the right to counsel to be waived \ninappropriately in the justice courts, leaving defendants to negotiate directly with the prosecutor, \nmost often resulting in a guilty plea and sentencing at the first court appearance. \n298.  In many counties, justice courts hold “DA nights” in which a district attorney is \npresent to represent the prosecution in critical proceedings, but oftentimes no public defense \nattorney is available to represent indigent defendants.  During these proceedings, when no public \ndefense attorney is present, indigent defendants must negotiate and interact with both the justice \nand the prosecutor and may even enter a guilty plea, all without the benefit of counsel. \nIncoherent or Excessively Restrictive Financial Eligibility Standards and Delays in the \nAppointment of Counsel \n \n299.  The lack of statewide eligibility standards results in incoherent and poorly \ndesigned processes for determining whether defendants are financially eligible for public \nrepresentation and for ensuring prompt assignment of counsel. \n  72\n\n300.  The Kaye Commission found that “[t]here are no clear standards regarding \neligibility determinations and procedures,” and that “[i]n the absence of uniform guidelines, \nsubjective and sometimes disparate eligibility determinations are made across the state, and \ncompeting concerns such as county funding and workload may become inappropriate factors in \nthe determination.”  \n301.  National and state standards for the administration of a public defense system \nmandate clear guidelines governing eligibility determinations, in order to ensure that defendants \nwho need public representation are not denied their right to counsel.  See NLADA Guidelines for \nLegal Defense Systems in the United States (1976), Guidelines I-1.5, I-1.6; NAC Report of the \nTask Force on Courts (1973), Standard 13.2; NYSDA, Standards for Providing Constitutionally \nand Statutorily Mandated Legal Representation in New York State (2004), Standard VII; \nNYSBA Standards for Providing Mandated Representation (2005), Standards C-1, C-2. \n302.  National and state standards for the provision of public defense services also \nmandate that defense counsel be assigned as soon as possible after arrest, detention or a request \nfor counsel.  See ABA Ten Principles, Principle 3; ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Defense \nFunction (3d ed. 1993), Standard 4-3.6; ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Providing Defense \nServices (3d ed.1992), Standard 5-6.1; NLADA Guidelines for Legal Defense Systems in the \nUnited States (1976), Standard I-1.2; NLADA Standards for the Administration of Assigned \nCounsel Systems (1989), Standard 2.5; NLADA Guidelines for Negotiating and Awarding \nGovernmental Contracts for Criminal Defense Services (1984), Guidelines III-18; NAC Report \nof the Task Force on Courts (1973), Standard 13.1; NYSDA, Standards for Providing \nConstitutionally and Statutorily Mandated Legal Representation in New York State (2004), \n  73\n\nStandard V(A)(3); NYSBA Standards for Providing Mandated Representation (2005), Standard \nB-1, B-2, B-4. \n303.  In Onondaga County, the assigned counsel program maintains written standards \nfor eligibility that improperly exclude eligible defendants from representation.  For example, \nownership of a home – even a mobile home – automatically precludes assignment of counsel, \nwithout consideration of the value of the home, the equity in the home, or the ability to obtain a \nloan against the home.  The standards also fail to consider whether clients carry any debts that \nwould prevent them from being able to afford a lawyer.   \n304.  Minors in Onondaga County are excluded from representation based on parental \nincome, even if the parent will not pay for a lawyer, and based on lack of parental cooperation in \nproviding income information.   \n305.  In practice, moreover, eligibility determinations in Onondaga County are made by \neach judge according to his or her different and often subjective standards and procedures.  The \nadministrator of the assigned counsel program recently sent a letter from the county pressuring \njudges to assign counsel in fewer cases because of the county’s fiscal concerns.  \n306.  A lack of clarity regarding eligibility and assignment procedures in Onondaga \nCounty results in occasions where assigned counsel will attempt to coerce public defense clients \ninto paying fees, a phenomenon, known as “flipping” a client.  For example, one client reported \nthat his assigned counsel attorney demanded $7500, with a $2500 retainer, before he would do \nany work on the client’s case.  The attorney also phoned the client’s wife to demand payment.  \nThe client has not been able to pay the attorney and has remained incarcerated for over a month \nwhile his attorney persists in adjourning his court dates.  A client of another assigned counsel \n  74\n\nattorney paid his appointed lawyer $2000 that he borrowed from his family for the promise of a \n“better result.”   \n307.  In Ontario County, judges make initial eligibility decisions based on their \nsubjective determinations of a defendant’s financial status, rather than through any standard \nprocess applying clear and uniform guidelines.  Ultimate discretion over eligibility decisions \nrests with the assigned counsel administrator, with no avenue for judicial appeal.  \n308.  Schuyler County has excessively stringent eligibility standards that result in the \nexclusion of clients who should qualify for a public defender.  For example, owning a car is \nconsidered evidence that a client can afford a private lawyer, regardless of the value of the car, \nand without accounting for the fact that a car is a basic necessity in rural Schuyler.  One judge \nindicated to a defendant that if he made more than $16,000 a year, he would not qualify.  Despite \nhaving one of the highest poverty rates in the State of New York, over the past four years nearly \nhalf of the clients referred to the Schuyler County public defender have been deemed “not \nindigent.”  Many people who are considered eligible in surrounding counties are deemed \nineligible for public defender services in Schuyler.   \n309.  Defendants in Schuyler County under the age of 21 are often disqualified based \non parental income, regardless of whether the defendant is able to rely on that income.   \n310.  In Suffolk County, eligibility determinations are based on income and the value of \nany assets that the applicant owns without accounting for debts, the amount of equity in any \nassets, other financial obligations, or the actual cost of retaining a private attorney to defend \nagainst the relevant charge.  One defendant was denied a legal aid attorney after informing the \ncourt that he earned $12 per hour and that his weekly income after taxes is approximately $380.  \nWithout inquiring further into the defendant’s financial status, family obligations, or ability to \n  75\n\npay for an attorney, the judge informed the defendant that he would need to retain a private \nattorney.  Forced between paying rent and paying to retain an attorney, the defendant chose to \npay his rent and proceed without counsel.   \n311.  Clients under the age of 21 in Suffolk County may be excluded from \nrepresentation based on parental income, even if they are estranged from their parents or their \nparents refuse to pay for a lawyer.   \n312.  In many of the justice courts in Suffolk County, eligibility determinations are \nmade by judges based on arbitrary and subjective standards, often resulting in the denial of \ncounsel for individuals who should be found eligible for public defense services.     \n313.  In Washington County, eligibility determinations are made by the public defender \noffice based on written guidelines that account only for income and family size and do not \naccount for debts and other significant financial obligations.   \n314.  In many counties, the system for determining eligibility results in serious delays \nand barriers to the appointment of counsel.  For example, there are often delays in the \nappointment of counsel because of confusion on the part of applicants regarding the process for \napplying, the failure of judges to properly inform eligible defendants about the process, failure to \nappoint counsel immediately at arraignment, and difficulties in sorting out conflicts in multiple-\ndefendant felony cases.   \n315.  In Ontario County, for example, it is not uncommon for incarcerated clients to \nwait several days before learning the names of their attorneys and having an opportunity to \ncommunicate with them.  In Onondaga County, one client languished in jail for three weeks \nbefore learning the name of his assigned counsel.   \n  76\n\n316.  In Schuyler County, clients sometimes must wait a month or more after arrest \nbefore being assigned an attorney.  One client applied for counsel the day she was arrested but, \nafter not hearing from the public defender’s office for over a month, gave up and asked a public \ndefender from an adjacent county to represent her.   \nLack of Attorney-Client Contact and Communication \n317.  Indigent defendants in the Counties suffer from a lack of access to and \ncommunication with their public defense counsel.   \n318.  The Kaye Commission found that it is common to find public defense attorneys \nwho do “not visit their clients in jail, return phone calls, answer letters, or conduct even minimal \ninvestigations of their clients’ cases.  In some counties, the only attorney-client contact available \nis through collect calls to counsel, which many counsel refuse to accept.  In a number of \ncounties, attorney-client contact occurs only when the defendant is brought to court for a \nscheduled appearance.”  \n319.  National and state standards for public defense systems recognize that client \ncontact and communication are essential elements of meaningful and effective representation.  \nSee ABA Ten Principles, Principle 4 (commentary); ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, \nProsecution Function and Defense Function (3d ed. 1993), Standards 4-2.1, 4-3.1, 4-3.8; \nNLADA Guidelines for Legal Defense Systems in the United States (1976), Guideline I-1.3(a); \nNLADA Performance Guidelines for Criminal Defense Representation (1995), Guideline 1.3(c); \nNAC Report of the Task Force on Courts (1973), Standard 13.3; NYSDA, Standards for \nProviding Constitutionally and Statutorily Mandated Legal Representation in New York State \n(2004), Standard VIII(A)(5), (7); NYSBA Standards for Providing Mandated Representation \n(2005), Standard I-3. \n  77\n\n320.  In Onondaga County, the assigned counsel program does not monitor or \nencourage attorney-client contacts.  Indeed, the program frequently cuts vouchers for “too much” \nclient contact.  Most assigned counsel attorneys are unable or unwilling to visit their clients in \njail and conduct all client contact prior to court appearances.  One client reported having been \nincarcerated on misdemeanor charges for almost five months and never having spoken with his \nattorney about his case.  Another attorney’s client complained to the Onondaga Human Rights \nCommission that he had been in jail for more than 200 days without being indicted and had not \nseen his assigned counsel attorney in several months.  When confronted with this fact by the \nOnondaga County Human Rights Commission, the attorney responded that he could not visit his \nclient more often because “[Onondaga] County will not pay for superfluous jail visits.”   \n321.  In Onondaga County, assigned counsel under pressure of excessive caseloads \nfrequently do not have time to speak to a client about anything other than a plea offer.  One client \nreported that, after being unable to reach his attorney during several weeks in jail, he attempted \nto discuss his case with her before a court appearance but she interrupted him, said she “doesn’t \nwant to hear it,” and refused to discuss anything but the prosecutor’s plea offer.  When the client \nexpressed discomfort with the offer, the attorney began to walk away, swore at the client, and \ntold him that if he wanted to go to trial he’d have to find another attorney. \n322.  Many incarcerated clients in Onondaga are unable to speak with their attorneys \nbecause their offices will not accept collect calls and their voicemail boxes, which are accessible \nby direct line from the jail, are always full.   \n323.  The Ontario County assigned counsel program also does not monitor or ensure \nadequate attorney-client contacts.  Incarcerated clients are often unable to reach their attorneys \nand do not receive timely updates about the status of their cases. \n  78\n\n324.  In Schuyler County, incarcerated inmates often cannot reach their public defender \nbecause their public defender’s office is not equipped to or will not accept collect phone calls, \nwhich are some inmates’ only means of making telephone calls.  Released clients also may have \ntrouble meeting with their attorney, particularly as the conflict defender and most assigned \ncounsel attorneys maintain offices in other counties that are difficult and expensive to reach.    \n325.  In Suffolk County, clients often complain that their attorneys do not return their \ncalls and only want to talk about plea bargains.  Clients are often pressured to accept plea \nbargains without any explanation of alternative options.  Incarcerated clients rarely meet with \ntheir Legal Aid attorney outside of court appearances.   \n326.  In Washington County, public defense attorneys rarely meet with clients outside \nof court appearances, most often in public places such as at counsel’s table within earshot of the \njudge and the prosecutor.  Incarcerated clients have particular trouble communicating with their \nattorneys.  Although the county jail has established a system for allowing toll-free legal calls \nfrom the jails, not all the public defenders have taken advantage of this system. Communication \nis so infrequent that one public defense attorney even arranged a plea bargain before ever having \nmet his client.  The bargain was struck based on the prosecutor’s version of the facts then \npresented to the client in a public hallway outside the court as a fait accompli.   \n327.  In all the Counties, public defense lawyers frequently waive client’s rights, such \nas the right to a preliminary hearing or the right to testify before a Grand Jury, without consulting \nwith their clients or explaining the reasons for the waiver, sometimes against their clients’ \nexpress instructions.  For example, in Onondaga County, a client strongly wished to testify \nbefore the Grand Jury in order to present an alibi and offer witnesses in support of his alibi, but \nrepeated phone calls to his assigned counsel attorney from the jail, as well as calls from the \n  79\n\nclient’s family, were ignored, and the client was unable to assert his right to testify or even \ndiscuss the option with his lawyer. \n328.  A lack of attorney-client communication particularly harms clients with mental \nhealth issues. In Suffolk County, for example, a 22-year-old veteran of the Iraq War who was \ndiagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome upon his return from Iraq was represented by a \nLegal Aid attorney who failed to communicate with the client at any time before, during, or after \narraignment. As a result, the attorney did not learn of or address the client’s mental health issues.  \nWithout access to mental health treatment, the client was almost immediately arrested again and \nspent two days in jail before being assigned to a second Legal Aid attorney who also failed to \ncommunicate with the client about his mental health issues.  Only when the client’s mother \ndirectly communicated with the judge about the defendant’s Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome \nwas the client given a mental examination and offered assistance. \n329.  A lack of attorney-client contact often results in prejudice to a client’s case or \nunnecessary incarceration.  For example, in Onondaga County, a client facing misdemeanor \ncharges missed a court appearance because his attorney never informed him of the court date and \nnever returned the client’s repeated phone calls.  As a result, a bench warrant was issued and the \nclient was arrested, denied bail, and spent almost a month in jail.  The client reported that he felt \npressure to plead guilty just so he could get out of jail, even though he felt he had a valid \ndefense. \nLack of Attorney Hiring Criteria, Performance Standards and Supervisory Controls \n330.  There are no meaningful attorney hiring criteria, performance standards or \nsupervisory controls to ensure basic quality of representation among public defense service \nproviders. \n  80\n\n331.  The Kaye Commission found that “[d]espite the existence of various sets of \nstandards for representation that bar associations have issued over the years, there is no single set \nof standards that actually governs what ‘adequate’ indigent defense services means.”  Moreover, \nbecause the practice standards that exist are not enforceable in New York, “in some areas, \nsubstandard practice has become the acceptable norm.”   \n332.  National and state standards for the administration of a public defense system \nstate that written hiring criteria are necessary to ensure that an attorney’s ability, training, and \nexperience match the complexity of the cases he or she faces.  See First Department Indigent \nDefense Organization Oversight Committee, General Requirements for All Organized Providers \nof Defense Services to Indigent Defendants (1996), Performance Standard II; NLADA \nGuidelines for Legal Defense Systems in the United States (1976), Standard V-5.9;  NYSBA \nStandards for Providing Mandated Representation (2005), Standard E-2; see also ABA Ten \nPrinciples, Principle 6 (requiring that counsel’s ability, training, and experience match the \ncomplexity of the case); NLADA Performance Guidelines for Criminal Defense Representation \n(1995), Guideline 1.2(a) (same). \n333.  National and state standards also mandate that a public defense system maintain \nwritten performance standards complemented by a system of active supervisory control.  See \nABA Ten Principles, Principle 10; First Department Indigent Defense Organization Oversight \nCommittee, General Requirements for All Organized Providers of Defense Services to Indigent \nDefendants (1996), Performance Standards IV & VI; NLADA Guidelines for Legal Defense \nSystems in the United States (1976), Standard V-5.4;  NLADA Standards for the Administration \nof Assigned Counsel Systems (1989), Standard 4.4; NYSDA, Standards for Providing \nConstitutionally and Statutorily Mandated Legal Representation in New York State (2004), \n  81\n\nStandard VI(E); NYSBA Standards for Providing Mandated Representation (2005), Standard J-1 \nto J-9. \n334.  The criteria for placement on the assigned counsel panels in the Counties are \nminimal and do not create any meaningful check on the quality of representation.  In Schuyler \nCounty, for example, any willing attorney, no matter how inexperienced, can be appointed to the \nmost complex felony case.  In Washington County, an individual with knowledge of the system \nreported that some attorneys on the assigned counsel panel are “barely qualified to practice law.”  \nAn attorney on the assigned counsel panel in Washington reported that he had been assigned a \ncomplex felony case straight out of law school, even though he thought that was “unfair” to his \nclient.  In Onondaga County, the criteria for getting on the panels are minimal and may be \nwaived.   \n335.  The institutional providers in Schuyler, Suffolk and Washington counties do not \nhave any written hiring criteria for attorneys. \n336.  None of the Counties have any binding or enforceable written performance \nstandards for attorney conduct.  \n337.  In Suffolk County, Legal Aid attorneys are evaluated and promoted almost \nexclusively based on the number of cases that they dispose of each year.  Thus, there is an \nenormous incentive to encourage pleas regardless of whether they are in the best interest of the \nclients.  Consequently, less than one percent of all cases are brought to trial.  For example, one \nLegal Aid Society client found himself represented by a new attorney at a court proceeding \nseveral days after his arrest.  Prior to the proceeding, the attorney met with the client for only 5 \nminutes and advised the client to accept a plea bargain even though the offer equaled the \nmaximum sentence for the pending charges.  The attorney refused to seek a reduction in the \n  82\n\ncharges or to attempt to negotiate a better plea offer.  Because no other options were explained to \nhim, the defendant accepted the plea bargain, believing that he had no choice but to do so.   \n338.  In Onondaga County, because there are no supervisory controls over assigned \ncounsel, attorneys who have repeatedly been removed from representing individual clients by \njudges for cause are still permitted to remain on the assigned counsel panel lists and receive new \nclient assignments.   \n339.  Moreover, because Onondaga County has no meaningful system for handling \ncomplaints and disciplining attorneys for inadequate performance, clients are often not able to \nget an attorney removed for cause when removal would be appropriate.  For example, Plaintiff \nRichard Love, who is African-American, asked a judge to remove his attorney after his attorney \nmade a racist comment to him during a court appearance.  The judge asked if Mr. Love could \nafford his own attorney.  When Mr. Love reported that he could not, the judge replied, “then \nyou’re stuck.”  Only when a different judge was assigned to Mr. Love’s case was his attorney \nremoved and a new attorney assigned. \nLack of Training \n340.  Public defense service providers in the Counties are not subject to any statewide \ntraining requirements related to criminal defense representation and are not provided with \nadequate access to training programs.   \n341.  The Kaye Commission found that “very few institutional providers have in place \nviable training programs and … [i]n regard to assigned counsel and contract defense programs, \ntraining ranges from non-existent to the barely adequate.”  \n342.  Onondaga, Ontario, Schuyler, and Washington counties have no training \nrequirements for public defenders or assigned counsel other than the standard Continuing Legal \n  83\n\nEducation (CLE) requirements for active membership in the Bar, which do not require \nspecialized courses in criminal defense practice.  Furthermore, these Counties do not allocate any \nfunding for public defense service providers to fulfill their CLE requirements. \n343.  In Suffolk County, there are no formal training requirements for attorneys beyond \nthe requirement to obtain some of their annual CLE credits in criminal law.  Lack of funding \noften prohibits attorneys from participating in outside training workshops and seminars. \n344.  One effect of the lack of training is that many public defense attorneys are \nunaware of, and thus unable to advocate for, available alternatives to incarceration for their \nclients.  For example, in Suffolk County, a Legal Aid attorney incorrectly informed a defendant \nthat he did not qualify for a drug treatment program that can serve as an alternative to \nincarceration.  The defendant performed his own research and learned that he did in fact qualify.  \nUnable to contact his attorney after repeated attempts, the defendant wrote to the judge, who \nappointed a new attorney and approved the defendant’s admission to the treatment program. \n345.  National and state standards for public defense systems recognize that meaningful \nand effective representation cannot occur without a mandatory, universal training program for \npublic defense providers.  See ABA Ten Principles, Principle 9 (commentary); ABA Standards \nfor Criminal Justice, Providing Defense Services (3d ed. 1992), Standard 5-1.5; NLADA \nDefender Training and Development Standards (1997), Standard 1.1; NLADA Guidelines for \nLegal Defense Systems in the United States (1976), Guideline V-5.7, 5.8; NLADA Guidelines \nfor Negotiating and Awarding Governmental Contracts for Criminal Defense Services (1984), \nGuideline III-17; NLADA Standards for the Administration of Assigned Counsel Systems \n(1989), Standards 4.2, 4.3.1, 4.3.2, 4.4; NLADA Performance Guidelines for Criminal Defense \nRepresentation (1995), Guideline 1.2(b); NAC Report of the Task Force on Courts (1973), \n  84\n\nStandard 13.16; NYSDA, Standards for Providing Constitutionally and Statutorily Mandated \nLegal Representation in New York State (2004), Standard VI(A), (B); NYSBA Standards for \nProviding Mandated Representation (2005), Standard F-1, F-2; N.Y. CLS Sup. Ct. § 613.9 \n(2007). \nLack of Support Services and the Failure to Conduct Investigations and Seek Expert Services \n346.  Public defense service providers in the Counties are not provided with the \nresources required to obtain necessary support services, including investigators and experts.  \nWithout these services, preparing a constitutionally and legally adequate defense for clients is \noften impossible.   \n347.  The Kaye Commission found that public defense services throughout the State are \nmarked by “inadequate provision of and lack of requests for expert and investigative services.” \n348.  National and state standards for public defense systems recognize that the \nprovision of meaningful and effective assistance of counsel requires adequate support staff, \nincluding investigators, and that conducting investigations is a key component of competent \ncounsel.  See ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Providing Defense Services (3d ed. 1992), \nStandard 5-1.4; ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Prosecution Function and Defense Function \n(3d ed. 1993), Standard 4-4.1(a); NLADA Performance Guidelines for Criminal Defense \nRepresentation (1995), Guideline 4.1; NLADA Guidelines for Legal Defense Systems in the \nUnited States (1976), Guideline IV-4.1; NLADA, Guidelines for Negotiating and Awarding \nGovernmental Contracts for Criminal Defense Services (1984), Standard III-9; NLADA \nStandards for the Administration of Assigned Counsel Systems (1989), Standard 4.6; NAC \nReport of the Task Force on Courts (1973), Standard 13.14; NYSDA, Standards for Providing \nConstitutionally and Statutorily Mandated Legal Representation in New York State (2004), \n  85\n\nStandard VIII(A)(6); NYSBA Standards for Providing Mandated Representation (2005), \nStandard H-1, H-6.  See also N.Y. County Law §§ 722, 722-c (2007). \n349.  National and state standards for public defense systems recognize that a \nconstitutionally and legally adequate public defense system must allow for the appointment of \nexperts where necessary to present a meaningful and effective defense.  See ABA Standards for \nCriminal Justice, Providing Defense Services, Standard 5-1.4; NLADA Guidelines for Legal \nDefense Systems in the United States (1976), Guideline III-3.1; NLADA, Guidelines for \nNegotiating and Awarding Governmental Contracts for Criminal Defense Services (1984), \nGuideline III-8; NLADA Performance Guidelines for Criminal Defense Representation (1995), \nGuideline  4.1(b)(7); NAC Report of the Task Force on Courts (1973), Standard 13.14; NYSDA, \nStandards for Providing Constitutionally and Statutorily Mandated Legal Representation in New \nYork State (2004), Standard VIII(A)(8)(c); NYSBA Standards for Providing Mandated \nRepresentation (2005), Standards H-1, H-6; N.Y. County Law §§ 722, 722-c (2007). \n350.  In 2006, based on data reported by the counties, New York State spent an average \nof $11.80 per case on investigative services and $5.65 per case on expert services. \n351.  In Onondaga and Ontario counties, as is common among counties that rely on an \nassigned counsel system, assigned counsel must apply to the Court for approval of funds for \ninvestigative and expert services, and there is often tacit pressure not to apply for such services \nin order to keep costs down. \n352.  In Onondaga County, some judges are reluctant to order expenditures of county \nfunds on investigators and experts, and many assigned counsel have given up requesting funds \nfor such services.  One judge has noted that, mindful of costs, he requires attorneys to provide \n  86\n\n“lots of detail” as to their need for investigator services.  Not surprisingly, this judge reports that \nhe “does not receive requests for investigators … except in the most serious cases.” \n353.  In Ontario County, some courts report receiving as few as one or two requests per \nyear for expert or investigative services.   \n354.  In Schuyler and Washington counties, the public defender offices have inadequate \nsupport staff, have no staff paralegals or investigators, and do not have the capacity to conduct \ninvestigations.  In Schuyler County, public defenders have been forced to use the State’s experts \nin their defense of their clients.  Washington County reports having spent no money on expert \nservices in 2005 and 2006.   \n355.  In Suffolk County, the Legal Aid Society employs only six staff investigators to \nsupport 60 attorneys and investigate approximately 26,000 cases per year, despite the fact that \nABA standards suggest there should be one staff investigator for every three attorneys.  ABA \nTen Principles, Principle 8 (commentary n.23).  Most of these investigators hold other jobs, are \navailable only part-time, and have other administrative responsibilities outside of performing \ninvestigations.  The Suffolk County Legal Aid Society also has no paralegals or support staff \nwith legal training.  Additionally, attorneys must sometimes share computers, impeding their \nability to conduct online research and perform other functions necessary to represent their clients \nmeaningfully and effectively \n356.  The Suffolk County Legal Aid Society reports having spent no money on experts \nfrom 2002 to 2006.  In 2006, only 2% of the assigned counsel program’s reported expenses were \nattributed to expert services.  \n \n \n  87\n\nExcessive Caseloads and/or Workloads \n357.  Public defense service providers in the Counties operate under the burden of \nexcessive caseloads and/or workloads that compromise their ability to provide effective \nrepresentation to their clients.  \n358.  None of the Counties has meaningful, written caseload or workload standards or \nany effective mechanism to monitor attorney caseloads and workloads.   \n359.  The Kaye Commission found that “virtually all institutional defenders … labor \nunder excessive caseloads.”   \n360.  In the Counties that rely on assigned counsel, attorneys are free to represent, in \naddition to their private clients and appointments from other counties, as many appointed clients \nas they choose.  In Counties that rely on an institutional defender, excessive overall caseloads \nand workloads reduce public defense attorneys’ ability to meaningfully and effectively represent \neach client.  In Washington County, one public defender reported that he had “too many cases” \nand admitted that his high caseload puts pressure on him to take pleas for his clients even when \nhe believes the client has a strong defense.   \n361.  The problem of excessive caseloads is compounded in many of the Counties by a \nreliance on part-time public defenders with competing private practices that distract from their \npublic defense docket and create excessive caseload burdens.  The institutional defenders in \nSchuyler and Washington counties, for example, rely exclusively on part-time assistant \ndefenders, and the chief defenders in both counties have private practices in addition to their \nostensibly “full time” public defender jobs.  \n  88\n\n362.  The problem is further compounded by the fact that all public defense service \nproviders in the Counties are also responsible for handling Family Court cases, which many \nattorneys report require even more time and resources than criminal cases. \n363.  Excessive caseloads and workloads place enormous pressure on public defense \nattorneys to secure plea agreements and avoid going to trial, even when this decision may not be \nin the best interests of their clients.  Across the State, based on data reported by the Counties in \n2006, less than 2% of public defense cases are taken to trial.  In the Counties, the trial rate is \n1.4%, or only 463 out of more than 32,000 reported public defense cases. \n364.  The strong pressure to obtain early pleas also places pressure on attorneys to \naccept plea offers that waive clients’ rights to appeal and other post-conviction remedies.  \nUnsurprisingly, therefore, only a very small percentage of criminal convictions in New York are \nappealed.  In 2006, according to data reported by the Counties, the percentage of criminal cases \nappealed in Onondaga, Ontario, Schuyler, Suffolk and Washington collectively was just 1.3%.  \nWashington County reported having no appeals in 2006, while Suffolk and Schuyler counties \nreportedly less than 1% of cases were appealed.   \n365.  National and state standards for the provision of public defense services provide \ncaseload management is an essential element of a constitutional public defense system.  See \nABA Ten Principles, Principle 5 (commentary); ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, \nProsecution Function and Defense Function (3d ed. 1993), Standard 4-1.3(e); ABA Standards for \nCriminal Justice: Providing Defense Services (3d ed. 1992), Standard 5-5.3; NLADA Guidelines \nfor Legal Defense Systems in the United States (1976), Guidelines V-5.1, 5.3; NLADA, \nGuidelines for Negotiating and Awarding Governmental Contracts for Criminal Defense \nServices (1984), Guidelines III-6, III-12; NLADA Standards for the Administration of Assigned \n  89\n\nCounsel Systems (1989), Standard 4.1.2; NYSDA, Standards for Providing Constitutionally and \nStatutorily Mandated Legal Representation in New York State (2004), Standards IV, III(E); \nABA Comm. on Ethics and Prof’l Responsibility, Formal Op. 06-441 (2006); NYSBA Standards \nfor Providing Mandated Representation (2005), Standards G-1, G-2. \nLack of Vertical Representation \n366.  The Counties’ public defense systems are often designed so that indigent \ndefendants are provided with different public defense attorneys at different stages of the \nprosecutorial process.  Such “horizontal” representation creates a barrier to forming a meaningful \nattorney-client relationship and developing a client’s trust.  Moreover, when a defendant’s case is \nbetween stages, it simply lies dormant with no representation being provided, no investigations \nconducted, and no counsel to advise the client until the case is assigned a new attorney at the \nnext stage. \n367.  The Spangenberg Group report found that, even though it diminishes the quality \nof representation, many public defense service providers provide this kind of “horizontal” \nrepresentation “for the sake of efficiency.”  \n368.  National and state standards for the administration of a public defense system \nprovide that, as a general rule, the same attorney should continuously represent the client until \ncompletion of the case.  See ABA Ten Principles, Principle 7; NLADA Guidelines for Legal \nDefense Systems in the United States (1976), Guideline 5.11; NLADA Standards for the \nAdministration of Assigned Counsel Systems (1989), Standard 2.6; NYSDA, Standards for \nProviding Constitutionally and Statutorily Mandated Legal Representation in New York State \n(2004), Standard V(A)(4); NYSBA Standards for Providing Mandated Representation (2005), \nStandard I-5.  See also N.Y. County Law § 717 (2007). \n  90\n\n369.  In Onondaga County, for example, certain assigned counsel are assigned \n“arraignment days” in the City and County courts to represent felony defendants being arraigned \nin any given day.  Some time after arraignment, clients are assigned a different lawyer.  \n370.  In Suffolk County, defendants charged with felonies are almost always assigned \ndifferent attorneys before and after indictment, often following substantial delays, and many \ndefendants find that they are represented by a different attorney every time they appear in court.  \nAs a result, criminal defendants facing felony charges must learn to trust and communicate with \na new attorney immediately after they are indicted, knowing that their previous attorney will no \nlonger be able to help them.   \n371.  In Schuyler and Washington counties, the system of assigning particular lawyers \nto particular courts means that nearly all felony defendants arraigned in a justice court are \nassigned to a new attorney when the case is transferred out of the justice court and into the \ncounty court, often after substantial delays.   \nThe Lack of Political and Professional Independence \n372.  The system of county-based funding and administration causes a lack of \nindependence from judicial, prosecutorial and political authorities for public defense services \nproviders in the Counties.   \n373.  The Kaye Commission found that, because of the State’s abdication of public \ndefense funding and administration responsibilities to the counties, “New York fails to ensure the \nindependence of its indigent defense providers who are too often subject to undue interference \nfrom the counties that fund them.”  \n374.  No fewer than seven county public defenders and legal aid society directors – \nfrom Saratoga, Rensselaer, Essex, Greene, Steuben, Onondaga, and Westchester counties – \n  91\n\ntestified before the Kaye Commission, citing specific instances of political interference with their \nability to provide meaningful and effective representation to their indigent clients.  \n375.  National and state standards for the administration of a public defense system \nrequire professional and political independence for public defense services providers in order to \nguarantee meaningful and effective representation of indigent defendants.  See ABA Ten \nPrinciples, Principle 1; ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Providing Defense Services (3d ed. \n1992), Standards 5-1.3, 5-1.6; NLADA Guidelines for Legal Defense Systems in the United \nStates (1976), Guideline 2.18; NLADA Standards for the Administration of Assigned Counsel \nSystems (1989), Standard 2.2; NLADA Guidelines for Negotiating and Awarding Governmental \nContracts for Criminal Defense Services (1984), Guideline II-1; NAC Report of the Task Force \non Courts (1973), Standard 13.8; NYSDA, Standards for Providing Constitutionally and \nStatutorily Mandated Legal Representation in New York State (2004), Standards II, III-A; \nNYSBA Standards for Providing Mandated Representation (2005), Standard A-1. See also DR 2-\n103 (22 NYCRR 1200.8). \n376.  In Onondaga, for example, the director of a legal aid society that formerly \nhandled a large percentage of the county’s criminal docket reported the following exchange with \na county legislator to the Kaye Commission: \nA legislative committee member asked me the following series of questions in a \nhostile tone of voice, starting with, isn’t it true that the legal aid society has a \npolicy of not disposing of cases at arraignment? I answered that that was in fact \nour policy because we were never given adequate resources to be able to meet our \nclients in jail before arraignment or to have staff present to discuss cases with \nthem before arraignment. Therefore, it would be a violation of an ethical \n[obligation] to our clients to do so. The next question was, isn’t it true that you \nmake motions in every case? The answer unfortunately was no. We don’t have the \nresources to do that…. The next question was, isn’t it true that you served \ndemands to produce in every case? The answer was yes. That is the statutory \nrequirement to preserve our client’s rights to discovery. And, finally, I was asked, \nisn’t it true that you require a written response from the DA’s office to those \n  92\n\ndemands? … These questions were very troubling because they imply that we \nwere doing something wrong by fulfilling our legal and ethical responsibility to \nour clients and that we were subjected to criticism for providing vigorous \nrepresentation to our clients… I was subsequently told by a member of the \njudiciary…that the word on the street was that we lost the city court program \nbecause we delayed cases. My response then and my response [now] is, one \nperson’s delay is another person’s due process. \n \nShortly after this exchange, the county terminated the legal aid society’s contract to perform \ncertain criminal public defense representation for Onondaga County.  \n377.  In Onondaga County, rather than leaving staffing decisions to the Assigned \nCounsel Program, judges make the decision not only whether counsel should be appointed, but \nwhich lawyers to appoint to cases in their courtroom.  This system creates a risk, and a \nperception among attorneys, that lawyers who do not ensure swift disposition of their client’s \ncases, even where swift disposition means sacrificing zealous representation, will not receive \nappointments from judges who are concerned about meeting state-set standards and goals for \nreducing docket congestion. \n378.  In both Onondaga and Ontario counties, assigned counsel must obtain judicial \napproval before spending any funds on investigators or expert services, thus subjecting counsel’s \njudgment regarding the services necessary for zealous advocacy to a court’s discretion. \n379.  There is no independent board or commission that oversees public defense \nservices in Schuyler County. The Chief Public Defender is appointed by the county legislature \nand must lobby the legislature for necessary budget allocations and meet performance-based \nstandards set by political actors in order to obtain sufficient funding.  \n380.  In Suffolk County, the Legal Aid Society must obtain annual budget approval \nfrom the Suffolk County legislature.  The Legal Aid Society must submit a detailed budget \nrequest and answer detailed questions about expenditures at a hearing before the county \n  93\n\nexecutive.  Based on that hearing, the county executive recommends a budget allocation for the \nLegal Aid Society and the legislature votes on the budget.  Most of the time, the Legal Aid \nSociety obtains less than the amount it has requested.  \n381.  In Washington County, there is no independent board or commission that \noversees public defense services.  The public defender is selected by means of a low-bid process \nin which the County Board of Supervisors appoints the candidate in part on the basis of a \nproposal to run the office most cheaply over a two-year period.  The Board of Supervisors \napproves the annual budget and must separately sign off on any expenditure for investigators or \nexperts in individual felony cases.  The county also accepts the low-bid proposal for conflict \ndefender services solely for cases arising out of the state prisons located in the county.  \nMoreover, judges have unlimited discretion to reduce assigned counsel’s bills for services.  As a \nresult, in 2006, per capita county expenditure for public defense in Washington County was \nunder $7.50, well below the state average of $21.21.   \nInadequate Compensation and Lack of Parity with Prosecutorial Counterparts \n382.  Public defense service providers in the Counties are, in general, inadequately \ncompensated and lack the resources needed to provide effective representation.   \n383.  National and state standards recognize the importance of adequately \ncompensating both assigned counsel lawyers and institutional public defense service providers. \nSee ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Providing Defense Services (3d ed. 1992), Standard 5-\n2.4; NLADA Guidelines for Legal Defense Systems in the United States (1976), Guidelines III-\n3.1, 3.2; NLADA, Guidelines for Negotiating and Awarding Governmental Contracts for \nCriminal Defense Services (1984), Guideline III-10; NLADA Standards for the Administration \nof Assigned Counsel Systems (1989), Standard 4.7.1; NAC Report of the Task Force on Courts \n  94\n\n(1973), Standards 13.7, 13.11; NYSDA, Standards for Providing Constitutionally and Statutorily \nMandated Legal Representation in New York State (2004), Standard III(C); NYSBA Standards \nfor Providing Mandated Representation (2005), Standard K-3.  See also N.Y. County Law § 722-\nb (2007). \n384.  In the federal system, guidelines state that the salaries and support given to federal \npublic defenders must be substantially similar to that provided to Assistant United States \nAttorneys in the Department of Justice.  See Guidelines for the Administration of the Criminal \nJustice Act and Related Statutes, Chapter IV, 4.02 A(3). \n385.  National and state standards also hold that comparable funding for prosecutorial \nand public defense services is a key measure of the health of a criminal justice system.  See ABA \nTen Principles, Principle 8; NLADA Guidelines for Legal Defense Systems in the United States \n(1976), Guideline 3.2; NYSDA, Standards for Providing Constitutionally and Statutorily \nMandated Legal Representation in New York State (2004), Standard III(C); NYSBA Standards \nfor Providing Mandated Representation (2005), Standard K-1. \n386.  In 1965, the New York State legislature passed Article 18-B, setting the rates of \ncompensation for private assigned counsel at $10 per hour for out-of-court work and $15 per \nhour for in-court time. The State raised rates slightly in 1977 and 1986, but rates remained \nstagnant from 1986 until 2003 until, following a lawsuit brought by the New York County \nLawyers Association, the Legislature raised the rates to $60 per hour for misdemeanors and \nlesser offenses and $75 per hour for felonies and all other eligible cases.   \n387.  As a result of the financial pressure caused by the rise in 18-B rates, assigned \ncounsel programs place pressure on assigned counsel to keep costs low and on assigned counsel \nadministrators to cut vouchers, even at the expense of the client’s needs and interests. \n  95\n\n388.  In Onondaga County, for example, a county court judge recently wrote an opinion \ncriticizing the assigned counsel program for “incessant bureaucratic nitpicking” in cutting \nattorney vouchers for reimbursement, remarking that “good attorneys” were being driven out of \nthe program and that the pattern of voucher-cutting “almost amounts to an on-going violation of \nthe Sixth Amendment.” \n389.  In Ontario County, assigned counsel are paid hourly rates that must cover the \ncosts of health insurance, retirement savings, and overhead costs such as support staff, desks, \ncomputers, legal research expenses, and office supplies.  Assigned counsel are often not \ncompensated for all the actual time devoted to their cases.  For example, the county will not \nreimburse assigned counsel for any time spent traveling to the various courts throughout the \ncounty. \n390.  The gross disparity between the resources available to public defenders and the \nresources available to prosecutors highlights the chronic under-funding of public defense in New \nYork, especially in light of the fact that public defense services providers must cover not only \ncriminal prosecutions but also child abuse and neglect cases, family offenses, custody and \nvisitation issues, paternity cases, and child support violations.    \n391.  Although the state provides money to supplement district attorneys’ salaries, it \ndoes not do so for the public defenders’ salary.  These state funds account for a large percentage \nof the salaries of many Counties’ district attorneys.  For example, in Schuyler, state funds \naccount for approximately half of the District Attorney’s wages. \n392.  The Kaye Commission found that “[p]rosecutors are consistently better funded \nand better staffed than indigent criminal defense service providers.  Their personnel, on average, \nhave higher salaries and greater ancillary resources than do their public defender counterparts.” \n  96\n\n393.  In Schuyler County, the Chief Public Defender’s salary in 2007 was $75,849, \nwhile the assistant public defender is paid $37,924.  The conflict defender was paid $2500 per \nmonth and must provide for his own malpractice insurance and training, as well as absorb all \noverhead expenses.  By contrast, the district attorney works in a fully supported office and makes \nmore than 50% more than the Chief Public Defender, earning $119,800.  \n394.  In Washington County, the Chief Public Defender’s salary in 2007 was $51,000, \nwhile the District Attorney was paid more than twice as much, earning $119,792.  Assistant \npublic defenders each earned $44,290, while assistant district attorneys earn up to $60,715.  In \naddition, the assistant public defenders must pay for their own malpractice and health insurance \nexpenses as well as overhead costs such as office space, support staff, legal research expenses, \ntransportation expenses, computers and office equipment and supplies.  Assistant district \nattorneys do not have to pay for these expenses and are provided with health care benefits. \n395.  According to the Spangenberg Group report, the Suffolk County Legal Aid \nSociety recently experienced a 16% turnover in staff, including the loss of experienced attorneys, \nbecause of low salaries.  \n396.  Inadequate resources and staffing within institutional providers can directly \nimpact representation. As Spangenberg Group’s report to the Kaye Commission noted, “[t]he \nneed to be efficient sometimes also results in an institutional provider turning a blind eye to \npotential conflicts of interest.”  For example, in Schuyler County, a lack of resources for full \nstaffing means that the Public Defender’s secretary administers the assigned counsel program \nand thus decides which lawyers will represent co-defendants of public defender office clients, \ncreating a systemic conflict of interest. \n  97\n\n397.  National and state standards for the provision of public defense services recognize \na public defense system must be designed to avoid conflicts of interest.  See ABA Standards for \nCriminal Justice, Defense Function (3d ed. 1993), Standard 4-3.5(c); NLADA Performance \nGuidelines for Criminal Defense Representation (1995), Guideline 1.3(b); NYSDA, Standards \nfor Providing Constitutionally and Statutorily Mandated Legal Representation in New York State \n(2004), Standard VIII(A)(4). \n \nThe Effect of the Public Defense Crisis on Indigent Criminal Defendants \n398.  Hampered by the aforementioned systemic flaws, public defense counsel do not \nor are not able to perform even the most basic tasks necessary to provide meaningful and \neffective representation to their clients.  They do not act as an adversarial check on the \nprosecutor in criminal cases. \n399.  Indigent criminal defendants in New York therefore are experiencing or are at \nsevere and unacceptably high risk of experiencing: wrongful denial of representation; wrongful \nconviction of crimes; unnecessary or prolonged pre-trial detention; guilty pleas to inappropriate \ncharges; waiver of meritorious defenses; guilty pleas taken without adequate knowledge and \nawareness of the full, collateral consequences of the pleas; harsher sentences than the facts of the \ncase warrant and few alternatives to incarceration; and waiver of the right to appeal and other \npost-conviction rights.  Defendants are routinely not asked about their immigration status, for \nexample, notwithstanding that a plea which may result in no jail time may ultimately cause the \ndeportation of some immigrant defendants. \n400.  The history of inadequate representation in New York State has created a \npervasive public belief that representation by a public defender is grossly inferior to \n  98\n\nrepresentation by a private attorney.  Public defender clients in Washington County routinely \nexpress their desire to hire a “real lawyer” or a lawyer who wasn’t just “a part of the system.”  \nSeveral clients reported a commonly held belief that public defenders work harder for their \npaying clients than for clients they represent as public defenders and that paying clients get more \nlenient plea bargains.  Similarly, in Schuyler County the chief public defender has resisted calls \nto move the public defender’s office into a county building because it would exacerbate clients’ \nperception that public defenders are not independent from the judicial and prosecutorial \nfunctions. \n \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n401.  The plaintiffs bring this class action pursuant to Article 9 of the New York Civil \nPractice Law and Rules on behalf of all indigent persons who have or will have criminal felony, \nmisdemeanor, or lesser charges pending against them in New York state courts in Onondaga, \nOntario, Schuyler, Suffolk and Washington counties (hereinafter, “the Counties”) who are \nentitled to rely on the government of New York to provide them with meaningful and effective \ndefense counsel.  The Class includes all indigent persons against whom criminal charges will be \nbrought in the Counties during the pendency of this action. \n402.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical.  At any given \npoint in time, more than thousands of people with criminal cases pending in New York State \ncourts in the Counties rely on public defense counsel for legal representation. \n403.  There are questions of law and fact common to the class that predominate over \nquestions affecting only individual members, including but not limited to:  \n  99\n\n(1) whether the State has the responsibility under the Constitution of the State of New \nYork and the United States Constitution to provide meaningful and effective \nassistance of counsel to indigent criminal defendants; \n \n(2) whether in abdicating its responsibility to the counties, the State has failed to \nensure that indigent criminal defendants receive meaningful and effective \nassistance of counsel; \n \n(3) whether the State funds the public defense system in a manner that impedes the \ndelivery of meaningful and effective assistance of counsel; \n \n(4) whether the State’s failure to oversee and set standards for the provision of public \ndefense services impedes the delivery of meaningful and effective assistance of \ncounsel; \n \n(5) whether the State’s failure to adequately fund, supervise and administer the public \ndefense system in the counties violates the constitutional and statutory rights of \nthe plaintiff class. \n \n404.  The claims of the class representatives are typical of the claims of the class \nmembers and by pursuing their own interests the class representatives will advance the interests \nof the absent class members. Each of the class members is being denied or is at severe and \nunacceptably high risk of being denied constitutionally and legally adequate assistance of \ncounsel as a result of the defendants’ failure to set standards for, oversee and fund public \ndefense. \n405.  The class representatives will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \nclass.  There are no conflicts of interest between the class representatives and the absent class \nmembers and the class representatives will vigorously prosecute this action on behalf of the \nclass. \n406.  A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy. \n  100\n\n407.  Defendant has consistently acted and refused to act in ways generally applicable \nto the class.  Thus, final declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to the class as a whole is \nappropriate.  \nOTHER ALLEGATIONS \n408.  Plaintiffs and the members of the class have suffered or are at imminent, severe \nand unacceptably high risk of suffering irreparable harm because of the Defendant’s failure to \nremedy the financial and administrative deficiencies that plague the provision of public defense.  \nThere is no adequate remedy at law to address those deficiencies or the consequent deprivation \nof adequate and competent assistance of counsel. \n \nCLAIMS \nFirst Cause of Action \n(Violation of Article I, § 6 of the Constitution of the State of New York) \n \n409.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate paragraphs 1-408 above. \n410.  Defendant is violating or will violate plaintiffs’ rights under Article I, § 6 of the \nConstitution of the State of New York by failing to provide meaningful and effective assistance \nof counsel and due process of law. \n \nSecond Cause of Action \n(Violation of New York State Statutes Guaranteeing the Right  \nto Counsel for Indigent Defendants) \n \n411.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate paragraphs 1-408 above. \n412.  Defendant is violating or will violate plaintiffs’ rights under New York County \nLaw § 717, 722-c; and New York Criminal Procedure Law §§ 170.10, 180.10, 180.80, 190.50, \nand 210.15 by failing to provide meaningful and effective assistance of counsel. \n  101\n\n \n \nThird Cause of Action \n(Violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983) \n \n413.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate paragraphs 1-408 above. \n414.  Defendant is violating or will violate plaintiffs’ rights to meaningful and effective \nassistance of counsel and to due process of law in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution and 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  \n \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, the plaintiffs respectfully request the following relief: \n(1) The certification of this action as a class action, pursuant to Article 9 of the New \nYork Civil Practice Law and Rules. \n(2) A declaration pursuant to CPLR § 3001 that the plaintiffs’ rights are being violated. \n(3) A preliminary and a permanent injunction requiring the defendant to provide a system \nof public defense consistent with the Constitution and laws of the State of New York \nand the United States Constitution. \n(4) An award of the plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees, costs and disbursements accrued in pursuit \nof this action under CPLR § 8601, CPLR § 909 and 42 U.S.C. § 1988; and \n(5) Any other relief the Court deems necessary or proper. \n \nDated: November 8, 2007 \n  New York, NY \n \n \n \n  102\n\n          Respectfully submitted, \n \n          NEW YORK CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION \n          FOUNDATION, by \n \n          _____________________________ \n          Corey Stoughton \n          Palyn Hung \n          Donna Lieberman \n          Arthur Eisenberg \n          Christopher Dunn \n          125 Broad St., 19th Floor \n          New York, NY 10004 \n          Tel: (212) 607-3300 \n          Fax: (212) 607-3318 \n           \n          -and- \n \n          SCHULTE ROTH & ZABEL  LLP \n \n          Gary Stein  \n          Danny Greenberg  \n          Sena Kim-Reuter  \n          Estee Konor  \n          Ximena Naranjo  \n          Michelle Paris  \n          919 Third Avenue  \n          New York, NY 10022  \n          Phone: (212) 756-2000 \n          Fax: (212) 593-5955       \n \n          Attorneys for Plaintiffs \n \nOn the Complaint:   Demetrius Thomas, NYCLU paralegal; Daniel J.

Alabama, the constitutional right to \ncounsel is more than a formality:  It would be \"vain\" to give the defendant a lawyer \"without \ngiving the latter any opportunity to acquaint himself with the facts or law of the case.\"  287 U.S. \n45,59 (1932) (quoting Com. v.  O'Keefe, 148 A. 73, 74 (Pa. 1929)).  Without taking a stance on \nthe merits of the case, the United States files this Statement of Interest to assist the Court in \nassessing whether the State of New York has \"constructively\" denied counsel to indigent \ndefendants during criminal proceedings.  Plaintiffs allege that their nominal representation \namounted to no representation at all, such that the State failed to meet itsfoundational \nobligations to provide legal representation to indigent defendants.  Gideon v.  Wainwright, 372 \nU.S. 335 (1963).  It is the position of the United States that constructive denial of counsel may \noccur in two, often linked circumstances: \n(1) When, on a systemic basis, lawyers for indigent defendants operate under substantial \nstructural limitations, such as a severe lack of resources, unreasonably high workloads, or \ncritical understaffing ofpublic defender offices; and/or \n(2) When the traditional markers of representation- such as timely and confidential \nconsultation with clients, appropriate investigation, and meaningful adversarial testing of \nthe prosecution's case-are absent or significantly compromised on a system-wide basis. \nUnder either or both of these circumstances, a COUlt  may find that the appointment of counsel is \nsuperficial and, in effect, a fOlm of non-representation that violates the Sixth Amendment \nguarantee of counsel. \nU.S. Statement of Interest  - I - U.S. Department of Justice \nCase No. 8866-07  Civil Rights Division, Special Litigation Section \n950 PelUlsyivania Avenue, NW \nWashington, D.C. 20530 \n(202) 514-4609 \n\nINTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES \n\nu.s.c. \nThe United States has authority to file this Statement of Interest pursuant to 28 \n§ 517, which permits the Attorney General to attend to the interests of the United States in any \ncase pending in a state court. The United States has an interest in ensuring that all \njurisdictions-federal, state, and local- are fulfilling their obligation under the Constitution to \nprovide effective assistance of counsel to individuals facing criminal charges who cannot afford \nan attorney, as required by GideoIJ . The United States can enforce the right to counsel in \njuvenile delinquency proceedings pursuant to the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement \nAct of 1994, 42 U.S.C. § 14141 (Section 14141).  The United States is currently enforcing \nSection 14141 's juvenilejustice provision through a comprehensive settlement with Shelby \nCounty, Tennessee. 1  An essential component of the agreement, which is subject to independent \nmonitoring, is the establishment of a juvenile public defender system with \"reasonable \nworkloads\" and \"sufficient resources to provide independent, ethical, and zealous representation \nto Children in delinquency matters.\"  Id. at 15. \nAs the Attorney General stated, \"It's time to reclaim Gideon's petition- and resolve to \nconfront the obstacles facing indigent defense providers.,,2  In March 2010, the Attorney General \nlaunched the Access to Justice Initiative to address the crisis in indigent defense services, and the \nInitiative provides a centralized vehicle for carrying out the Depal1ment of Justice's \n(Department) commitment to improving indigent defense.3  The Department has also sought to \nt Mem. of Agreement Regarding the Juvenile Court of Memphis and Shelby Counties, Tennessee (2012), available \n\nat http://www . just ice. gov/crt/aboutlspllfi ndsett Ie.phD. \n\n2 Attorney General Eric Holder Speaks at the Justice Department's 50th Anniversary Celebration of the U.S. \n\nSupreme Court Decision in Gideon v.

Four years later, the Supreme Court held that the right to counsel extended to \njuveniles in delinquency proceedings.  In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1,36 (1967).  And yet, as the \nAttorney General recently noted, \"America's indigent defense systems continue to exist in a state \nof crisis, and the promise of Gideon is not being met. ,,8  Recently, the federal district court in \nWilbur v. City ofMount Vernon echoed this concern, stating, \"The notes of freedom and liberty \nthat emerged from Gideon's trumpet a haifa century ago cannot survive if that trumpet is muted \nand dented by harsh fiscal measures that reduce the promise to a hollow shell of a hallowed \nright.\"  989 F.Supp.2d 1122, 1137 (W.D. Wash. 2013). \nOur national struggle to meet the obligations recognized in Gideon and Gault is well \ndocumented. 9  See, e.g., Am.

Last year, the United States filed a Statement of Interest in Wilbur v. City ofMount \nVernon , a case in which indigent defendants challenged the constitutional adequacy of the public \ndefense systems provided by the cities of Mount Vemon and Burlington in the Western District \nof Washington. 13  As in this case, the United States took no position on the merits of the \nplaintiffs' claims in Wilbur, but instead recommended to the court that, if it found for the \nplaintiffs, the COUlt should ensure that counsel for indigent defendants have realistic workloads, \nsufficient resources, and are canying out the hallmarks of minimally effective representation, \n\"such as visiting clients, conducting investigations, perfonning legal research, and pursuing \ndiscovery.\"  Ex. I at 5-10.  The COUlt  in Wilbur ultimately ruled for the plainti ffs, finding \"that \nindigent criminal defendants in Mount Vernon and Burlington are systematically deprived of the \nassistance of counsel at critical stages of the prosecution and that municipal policymakers have \nmade deliberate choices regarding the funding, contracting, and monitoring of the public defense \nsystem that directly and predictably caused that deprivation.\"  Wilbur, 989 F.Supp.2d at 1124. \nTo remedy this systematic deprivation ofcounsel, the court ordered increased resources for \nindigent defense services, controls to be established for defenders' workloads, and monitoring of \ndefenders' actual representation to ensure that they carry out the traditional markers of \nrepresentation.  ld. at 1134-37. \nDISCUSSION \nIn this matter, Plaintiffs allege that indigent defendants within five New York counties \nhave been constructively denied counsel in their criminal proceedings.  That is, as a result of \ninadequate funding, indigent defendants face systemic risks of constructive denial of counsel \n13 Anached as Exhibit I. \nU.S. Statement ofTnterest  -6 ­ U.S. Depat1 rnent of Ju st ice \nCase No. 8866-07  Civil Rights Di vision, Special Litigation Section \n950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW \n\\Vashington, D.C. 20530 \n(202) 514-4609 \n\nincluding: \"the system-wide failure to investigate clients' charges and defenses; the complete \nfailure to use expert witnesses to test the prosecution's case and support possible defenses; \ncomplete breakdowns in attorney-client communication; and a lack of any meaningful advocacy \non behalf of clients.\" Plaintiffs' Mem. of Law in Opposition to the State Defendant's Motion for \nSummary Judgment at 41.  An analysis of Gideon cases informs the United States' position that \nconstructive denial of counsel may occur when:  (I) on a systemic basis, counsel for indigent \ndefendants face severe structural limitations, such as a lack of resources, high workloads, and \nunderstaffing of public defender offices; lIlIti/OI' (2) indigent defenders are unable or are \nsignificantly compromised in their ability to provide the traditional markers of representation for \ntheir clients, such as timely and confidential consultation, appropriate investigation, and \nmeaningful adversarial testing of the prosecution's case.  Wilbur, 989 F.Supp.2d 1122; Pub. \nDefender v. State,  115 So. 3d 261; Missouri Pub. Defender Comm 'n, 370 S.W.3d 592; Duncan, \n832 N.W.2d 76 1; State v.  Young, 172 P.3d 138 (N.M. 2007); Citizen, 898 So.2d 325; Lavallee v. \nJustices in Hampden Superior Court, 812 N.E.2d 895 (Mass. 2004); New York Cnty. La\"yers' \nAss'n v.

Peart, 621 So.2d 780,789 (La. \n1993). \nConstructive denial may occur even in public defender systems that are not \nsystematically underfunded if the attorneys providing defender services are unable to fulfill their \nbasic obligations to their clients.  The Supreme Court has recognized that, in some \ncircumstances, \"although counsel is available to assist the accused during trial, the likelihood \nthat any lawyer, even a fully competent one, could provide effective assistance is so small that a \npresumption of prejudice is appropriate without inquiry into the actual conduct of the trial.\" \nU.S. Statement of Interest  -7 ­ U.S. Department of Ju stice \nCase No. 8866-07  Civil Right s Di vision, Special Litigation Section \n950 Pennsy lvania Avenue, NW \nWashington, D.C. 20530 \n(202) 514-4609 \n\nUnited States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 659-60 (1984).  This may occur when, for example, the \ndefense attorney is not provided sufficient time to prepare.  Powell, 287 U.S. at 53-5 8. \nThus, whether there are severe structural limitations, the absence of traditional markers of \nrepresentation, or both, the appointment of counsel is superficial and, in effect, a form of non-\nrepresentation that may violate the guarantees of the Sixth Amendment. 14 \nl. \t The Court May Consider Structural Limitations and Defenders' Failure to Carry \nOut Traditional Markers of Representation in its Assessment of Plaintiffs' Claim of \nConstructive Denial of Counsel. \nIt is a core guarantee of the Sixth Amendment that every criminal defendant, regardless \nof economic starns, has the right to counsel when facing incarceration.  Gideon, 372 U.S. at 340­\n44 (1963) (holding that the right to counsel is \" fundamental and essential to a fair trial\").  This \nright is so fundamental to the operation of the criminal justice system that its diminishment \nerodes the principles of libelty and justice that underpin all of our civil rights in criminal \nproceedings.  Gideon, 372 U.S. at 340-341 , 344; Powell, 287 U.S. at 67-69 (\"The right to be \nheard would be, in many cases, of little avail if it did not comprehend the right to be heard by \ncounsel .... [A Defendant] requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the \nproceedings against him.  Without it, though he be not guilty, he faces the danger of conviction \nbecause he does not know how to establish his innocence.\"); see also Alabama v. She/ton, 535 \nU.S. 654 (2002). \n1-1 If the Plaintiffs prevail, the court may appoint a monitor as part of its authority to grant injunctive relief. \nMonitors, or their equivalent, have been utilized in similar cases.  In Wilbllr, pursuant to an order for injunctive \nrelief, the court required the hiring of a \"Public Defense Supervisor\" to supervise the work of the public defenders. \nThe supervision and monitoring includes extensive file review, caseload assessments, data collection, and reports to \nthe court to ensure (here is \"actual\" and appropriate representation for indigent crirrunal defendants in the cities of \nMount Vernon and Burlington.  See Wilbllr, No. Cl 1-1100RSL at 19.  Similarly, in Grant County, Washington, an \nindependent monitor was essential to implementing the court's injunction in a right-to-counsel case.  Best l'.

Hurrell-Harring v. State, 930 N.E.2d 217, 224 (N.Y. 2010) \n(holding that these \"allegations state a claim, not for ineffective assistance under Strickland, but \nfor basic denial of the right to counsel under Gideon.\"); see also Luckey v. Harris, 860 F.2d \n1012, 1017 (IIth Cir. 1988) (holding that the Sixth Amendment protects rights that do not affect \nthe outcome of a tlial, and deficiencies that do not meet the \"ineffectiveness\" standard may still \nviolate a defendant's rights under the Sixth Amendment); Missouri Pub. Defenders Comm 'n, 370 \nS.W.3d at 607 (holding Sixth Amendment right to counsel requires more than just a \"pro forma\" \nappointment whereby the defendant has counsel in name only); Powell, 287 U.S. at 58-61 \n(holding that counsel's \"appearance was rather pro fOima than zealous and active [and] \ndefendants were not accorded the light of counsel in any substantial sense\").  COUlts have \nconsistently defined \"constructive\" denial of counsel as a situation where an individual has an \nattomey who is pro forma or \"in name only.\" \nA.  Considering the Role ofStructural Limitations \nThe provision of defense services is a multifaceted and complicated task.  To guide the \ndefense function, the ABA and NJDC have promulgated national standards to ensure that \ndefenders are able to establish meaningful attomey-c1ient relationships and provide the \nconstitutionally required services of counsel.  See ABA, STANDARDS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE, \nPROSECUTION AND DEFENSE FUNCTION; Am. Bar Ass'n, Standing Conun. on Legal Aid and \nIndigent Defendants, ABA Eight Guidelines ofPublic Defense Related to Excessive Workloads \n15 Strickland V.  Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). \nU.S. Statement of Interest  -9 ­ U.S. Depal1ment of Ju stice \nCase No. 8866-07  Civil Rights Di vision, Special Lit igation Section \n950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW \n\\Vashington, D.C. 20530 \n(202) 514-4609 \n\n(2009); Am. Bar Ass'n, Standing Conun. on Legal Aid and Indigent Defendants, ABA Ten \nPrinciples ofa Public Defense Delivery System (2002); NAT'L JUVENILE DEFENDER CTR., \nNATIONAL JUVENILE DEFENSE STANDARDS (2012).  These standards emphasize the structural \nSUPPOItS required to ensure that defenders can perfOim their duties. They include an independent \ndefense function, early appointment, adequate staffing, funding for necessary services (e.g., \ninvestigation, retention of experts, and administrative staff), workload controls, training, legal \nresearch resources, and oversight connected to practice standards. \nIn assessing Gideon claims for systemic indigent defense failures, courts have \nconsidered the absence of these structural SUPPOItS as reflected in insufficient funding, agency-\nwide lack of training and perfonnance standards, understaffmg, excessive workloads, delayed \nappointments, lack of independence for the defense function from the judicial or political \nfunction, and insufficient agency-wide expelt resources. 16  In Wilbur, for example, the court \nnoted the structural limitations- insufficient staffmg, excessive case loads, and almost non­\nexistent supelvision-that resulted in a system \"broken to such an extent that confidential \nattorney/client communications are rare, the individual defendant is not represented in any \nmeaningful way, and actual innocence could conceivably go unnoticed and unchampioned.\" \nWilbllr, 989 F.Supp.2d at 1127.  The court continued, \nThe COUlt does not presume to establish fixed numerical standards or a \nchecklist by which the constitutional adequacy of counsel's representation can \nbe judged.  The expel1s, public defenders, and prosecutors who testified at trial \nmade clear that there are myriad factors that must be considered when \ndetermining whether a system of public defense provides indigent criminal \n16 \\Ve note that, in alleging that there has been a constructive denial of counsel based on systemic indigent defense \nfailures, plaintiffs are not seeking to reverse criminal convictions but are seeking only prospecti ve injunctive relief. \nThe Court may enter prospective relief upon a finding of a substantial risk of a constitutional violation. See Brown \nv. Plata , 131 S. 0 . 1910, 1941 (2011).  In the context of a challenge to a criminal conviction, the defendant must \nalso show that the denial of counsel caused actual prejudice to secure a reversal.  Strickland, 466 U.S. 668.  Cronic, \n466 U,S. 648, creates a narrow exception to the need to show prejudice where the denial of counsel contaminates the \nent ire criminal proceeding. \nU.S. Statement of interest \t - 10- U,S. Depanment of Justice \nCase No. 8866-07 \t Civil Rights Division, Special Litigation Section \n950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N\\V \nWashington, D.C. 20530 \n(202) 514-4609 \n\ndefendants the assistance required by the Sixth Amendment.  Factors such as \nthe mix and complexity of cases, counsel's experience, and the prosecutorial \nand judicial resources available were mentioned throughout trial. \nWilbur, 989 F.Supp.2d at 1126. \nSimilarly, the court in Pub. Defender v. State, 115 So. 3d at 279, held that the public \ndefender's office could withdraw from representation of indigent defendants because of \nstlUcturallimitations.  Insufficient funds and the resultant understaffing created a situation where \nindigent defendants did not receive assistance of counsel as required by the Sixth Amendment. \nCourts have also held in indigent defense funding cases that budget exigencies cannot serve as an \nexcuse for the oppressive and abusive extension of attorneys' professional responsibilities, and \ncourts have the power to take corrective measures to ensure that indigent defendants' \nconstitutional and statutory rights are protected.  See Citizen, 898 So.2d at 336.  Similarly, in \nLavallee, 812 N.E.2d at 904, the cOUl1 held that proactive steps may be necessary when an \nindigent defense compensation scheme \"raises serious concerns about whether [the defendants] \nwill ultimately receive the effective assistance of trial counsel.\"  See also New York Cnty. \nLawyers' Ass  196 Misc. 2d. 761 (holding statutory rates for assigned counsel unconstitutional \n'/1, \nas they resulted in denial of counsel and excessive case loads, among other issues); Young, 172 \nP.3d 138 (holding that inadequate compensation of defense attorneys deprived capital defendants \nof counsel).  In all of these cases, the coul1s granted relief based on evidence that indigent \ndefense services were subject to such substantial structural limitations that actual representation \nwould simply not be possible. \nSubstantial stlUcturallimitations force even otherwise competent and well-intentioned \npublic defenders into a position where they are, in effect, a lawyer in name only.  Such \nlimitations essentially require counsel to represent clients without being able to fulfill their basic \nU.S. Statement of Interest  - 1 1 - U.S. Department of Justice \nCase No. 8866-07  Civil Rights Di vision, Special Litigation Section \n950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW \nWashington, D.C. 20530 \n(202) 514-4609 \n\nobligations to prepare a defense, including investigating the facts of the case, interviewing \nwitnesses, securing discovery, engaging in motions practice, identifying experts when necessary, \nand subjecting the evidence to adversarial testing.  Under these conditions, the issue is not \neffective assistance of counsel, but, as the Court of Appeals noted, \"nonrepresentation.\"  Hurrell-\nHarring, 930 N.E.2d at 224.  Other courts have emphatically made this same point.  As the \nSupreme Court of Louisiana stated, \"We know from experience that no attorney can prepare for \none felony trial per day, especially if he has little or no investigative, paralegal, or clerical \nassistance.\"  Peart, 621 So.2d at 789.  The court agreed with the trial court's characterization that \n\"[n]ot even a lawyer with an S on his chest could effectively handle this docket.\" ld.  The COUlt \nconcluded that \"[m]any indigent defendants in Section E are provided with counsel who can \nperfolm only pro forma, especially at early stages of the proceedings.  They are often \nsubsequently provided with counsel who are so overburdened as to be effectively unqualified.\" \nld. \nB.  Considering the Traditional Markers ofRepresentation \nIn addition to the presence of structural limitations, courts considering systemic denial of \ncounsel challenges have also examined the extent, or absence of, traditional markers of \nrepresentation.  The traditional markers of representation include meaningful attorney-client \ncontact allowing the attomey to conununicate and advise the client, the attorney's ability to \ninvestigate the allegations and the client's circumstances that may infolm strategy, and the \nattorney's ability to advocate for the client either through plea negotiation, trial, or post-trial. \nThese factors ensure that defense counsel provide the services that protect their client's due \nprocess rights. \nU.S. Statement of Interest  - 12 - U.S. Department of Justice \nCase No. 8866-07  Civil Rights Division, Special Litigation Section \n950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW \n\\Vashington, D.C. 20530 \n(202) 514-4609 \n\nThe New York Court of Appeals recognized the importance of these traditional markers, \nstating, \"Actual representation assumes a certain basic representational relationship.\"  Hurrell-\nHarring, 930 N.E.2d at 224.  Other courts have adopted this reasoning.  For example, in Wilbur, \n989 F.Supp.2d at 1128, clients met their attomeys for the first time in court and immediately \naccepted a plea bargain, without discussing their cases in a confidential setting.  The COUlt found \nthat these services \"amounted to little more than a 'meet and plead' system,\" and that the \nresulting lack of representational relationship violated the Sixth Amendment.  Id. at 1124. \nSimilarly, in Pub. DeJender v. State, 115 So. 3d at 278, the court reasoned that denial of counsel \nwas present where attomeys engaged in routine meeting and pleading practices, did not \ncommunicate with clients, were unable to investigate the allegations, and were unprepared for \ntrial. \nThe absence of these traditional markers of representation has led COUtts to find non-\nrepresentation in violation of the Sixth Amendment.  Wilbur, 989 F.Supp.2d at 11 31 (noting that \nin such cases \"the appointment of counsel may be little more than a sham and an adverse effect \non the reliability of the trial process will be presumed\") (citing Cronic, 466 U.S. at 658-60,  and \nAvery v. Alabama, 308 U.S. 444, 446 (1940)); see also Pub. DeJender, 115 So. 3d at 278; \nCitizen, 898 So.2d 325; Peart, 621 So. 2d at 789.  The traditional markers require the \n\"oppOltunity for appointed counsel to confer with the accused to prepare a defense,\" engage in \ninvestigation, and advocate for the client.  Wilbur, 989 F.Supp.2d at 1131 ; Public Defender v. \nState, 115 So. 3d at 278; Peart, 621 So.2d at 789; see also Missouri v. Frye, 132 S.

The \n6  United States did not paIticipate in the Ilial in this case and takes no position on whether \n7  Plaintiffs should prevail on the merits.  The United States files this SOl to provide expertise and \n8  a perspective that it may uniquely possess.  Ifthe Plaintiffs prevail, it is the position of the \n9  United States that the COUIt has discretion to enter injunctive relief aimed at the specific factors \n10  that have caused public defender services to fall short of Sixth Amendment guarantees, including \n11  the appointment of an independent monitor to assist the Court.  The United States has found \n12  monitoring aITangements to be critically impOitant in enforcing complex remedies to address \n13  systemic constitutional harms. \n14  In discussing the remedies available to the COUIt in this Statement, the United States will \n15  address questions (1) and (3) of the COUlt's Order for Further Briefing, with particular focus on \n16  the role of an independent monitor.  (Ok!. # 319.) To answer the COUIt'S first question, the \n17  United States is unaware of any federal court appointing a monitor to oversee reforms of a public \n18  defense agency, but the Ninth Circuit has recognized a federal court' s authority in this area under \n19  42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Miranda v. Clark County, NV, 319 FJd 465 (9th Cir. 2003).  The United \n20  States is aware of one case in which a federal court, through a Consent Order instituting reforms \n21  ofa County public defender agency, received reports from the county regarding the progress of \n22  those reforms.  Stinson v. Fulton Cnty. Ed. ofComm 'rs, No.1 :94-CV-240-GET (N.D. Ga. May \n23  21, 1999).  However, the Court did not have the benefit of an independent monitor to assist it in \n24  assessing the implementation of the refonns. \n25 \nU.S . Statement ofInterest  - I - U.S. Department of Justice \nCase No. Cll-01100 RSL  Civil Rights Division, Special Litigation Section \n950 Pennsylvania Ave nue, NW \nWashington, D.C. 20530 \n(202) 514-2000 \n\nCase 2:11-cv-Oll00-RSL  Document 322  Filed 08114113  Page 7 of 17 \n2  Also, an independent monitor is cun'ently monitOling systemic reform of a juvenile \n3  public defender system through an agreement between the United States and the Shelby County \n4  (TN) Juvenile COUlt (\"Shelby County\"). \n5  Finally, it is worth noting that but for removal to federal COUlt by the Cities here, this \n6  matter would have proceeded in state COUlt, and state court litigation over the crisis in indigent \n7  defense is not at all unusual.  Those cases bear out the practicality- and, at times, the \n8  necessity- of COUlt oversight in this area. \n9  In answer to the Court's third question, a number of states have imposed \"hard\" caseload \n10  standards, I but the United States believes that, should any remedies be warranted, defense \n11  counsel's workload should be controlled to ensure quality representation.  \"Workload,\" as \n12  defined by the ABA Tell Principles ofa Public Defense Delivery System, takes into account not \n13  only a defender's numerical caseload, but also factors like the complexity of defenders' cases, \n14  their skills and expelience, and the resources available to them. Workload controls may require \n15  flexibility to accommodate local conditions.  Due to this complexity, an independent monitor \n16  would provide the Court with indispensible SUppOlt in ensuring that the remedial purpose of \n17  workload controls is achieved. \n18  The Washington State Bar's Standards for Indigent Defense, incorporated by its Supreme \n19  Court in its climinal rules, considers the impOltance of workloads in evaluating the efficacy of \n20  defender services.  Washington's move to implement workload controls is a welcome \n21  recognition of its obligation under Gideon.  The United States recognizes that these standards are \n22  the result of work conunenced at least since 2003 by the Washington State Bar Association's \n23  Blue Ribbon Commission on Criminal Defense and suppOlted by the State Legislature, the \n24 \n\\ For example, Arizona, Georgia, and New Hampshire have specific caseload limitations.  A number of states have \n\"soft\" case load caps by lIsing a weighted system.

These workload controls are scheduled to go into effect October 2013 2 \n3 \nINTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES \n4 \nThe United States has authority to file this Statement of Interest pursuant to 28 U.S.c. \n5 \n§ 517, which permits the Attomey General to attend to the interests of the United States in any \n6 \ncase pending in federal court.  The United States has an interest in ensuring that all \n7 \njurisdictions- federal, state, and local-are fulfilling their obligation under the Constitution to \n8 \n.. \nprovide effective assistance ofcounsel to individuals facing criminal charges who cannot afford \n9 \nan attomey, as required by Gideon v.  Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963).  The United States can \n10 \nenforce the right to counsel in juvenile delinquency proceedings pursuant the Violent Crime \nII \nControl and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, 42 US.c. § 14141 (Section 14141).  As noted \n12 \nabove, the United States is cun'ently enforcing Section 14141 's juvenile justice provision \n13 \nthrough a comprehensive out-of-court settlement with Shelby County.3  An essential piece of the \n14 \nagreement, which is subject to independent monitoring, is the establislunent ofajuvenile public \n15 \ndefender system with \"reasonable workloads\" and \"sufficient resources to provide independent, \n16 \nethical, and zealous representation to Children in delinquency matters.\"  Id. at 14-15. \n17 \nAs the Attomey General recently proclaimed, \"It's time to reclaim Gideon's petition-\n18 \nand resolve to confront the obstacles facing indigent defense providers.,,4  In March 2010, the \n19 \nAttomey General launched the Access to Justice Initiative to address the access-to-justice crisis. \n20 \nIndigent defense reform is a critical piece of the office's work, and the Initiative provides a \n21 \n22 \n2 The United States does not by this mean to endorse or detract from the eff0l1s of these entities. \n\n23  3 Mem. of Agreement Regarding the Juvenile Court of Memphis and Shelby Counties, Tennessee (2012), available \n\nat http://www . justice. gov/crt/about/sp11ft ndsettle.php . \n\nAttorney General Eric Holder Speaks at the Justice Department's 50th Anniversary Celebration of the U.S. \n\n24  ..j \nSupreme Court Decision in Gideoll v.

Fifty years ago, the Supreme Court held \n12 \nthat \"any person haled into court, who is too poor to hire a lawyer, cannot be assured a fair tJial \n13 \nunless counsel is provided for him.\"  Gideon, 372 U.S. at 344.  And yet, as the Attorney General \n14 \nrecently noted, \"despite the undeniable progress our nation has witnessed over the last \n15 \nhalf-century-Arnerica's indigent defense systems continue to exist in a state of crisis,\" and \"in \n16 \nsome places-do little more than process people in and out of our coutis.\"s \n17  Our national difficulty to meet the obligations recognized in Gideon is well documented.9 \n18 \nSee, e.g. ABA Standing Committee on Legal Aid and Indigent Defendants RepOti, Gideon's \n19 \nBroken Promise:  America's Continuing Questfor Equal Justice, (December 2004).  Despite \n20 \n21  5 The office works with federal agencies, and state, local, and tribal justice system stakeholders to increase access to \n\ncounsel, highlight best practices, and improve the justice delivery systems that serve people who are unable to afford \n\n22  lawyers.

Cara H. Drinan, The Third Generation ofIndigent Defense Litigation, 33 \n13 \nN.Y.U. Rev. L  & Soc. Change 427 (2009) (describing crises nationwide).  In many states, \n14 \nremedying the crisis in indigent defense has required COUlt intervention.  E.g., State v. Citi::en, \n15 \n898 So.2d 325 (La. 2005); Hurrell-Harring v.

NACDL, Minor Crimes, Massive Waste 21 (2009).10 \n19 \nDISCUSSION \n20 \nIt is the position of the United States that it would be lawful and appropriate for the Court \n21 \nto enter injunctive relief if this litigation reveals systemic constitutional deficiencies in the \n22 \nDefendants' provision of public defender services.  Indeed, the concept of federal oversight to \n23 \naddress the crisis in defender services has gained momentum in recent years.  See, e.g,.

Swanll v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg \n12  Bd. ofEduc., 402 U.S. I, 15 (1971); see also Thomas v. County afLos Angeles, 978 F.2d 504, \n13  509 (9th Cir. 1992) (noting that coul1S have power to issue \"broad injunctive relief' where there \n14  exist specific findings ofa \"persistent pattern of [police] misconduct\").  When crafting injunctive \n15  relief that requires state officials to alter the maImer in which they execute their core functions, a \n16  court must be mindful of federalism concerns and avoid unnecessarily intrusive remedies. \n17  Labor/Community Strategy Center v. Los Angeles COUllty, 263 F.3d 1041, 1050 (9th Cir. 200 I). \n18  C0U11s have long recognized- across a wide range of institutional settings- that equity often \n19  requires the implementation of injunctive relief to correct unconstitutional conduct, even where \n20  that relief relates to a state's administrative practices.  See, e.g., Brown v. Plata, 13 1 S. Ct. 1910 \n21  (20 II) (upholding injunctive relief affecting State's administration of prisons); Brown v. Bd. of \n22  Edllc., 349 U.S. 294 (1955) (upholding injunctive relief affecting State's administration of \n23  schools).  Indeed, while C0U11S \"must be sensitive to the State's interest[s],\" C0U11s \"neveltheless \n24 \n25 \nU.S. Statement of Interest  -6 ­ U.S. Depal1ment of Justice \nCase No. CII-OIIOO RSL  Civil Rights Divi sion, Special Litigation Section \n950 Pennsylvania Av enue, NW \nWashington, D.C. 20530 \n(202) 514-2000 \n\nCase 2:11-cv-OllOO-RSL  Document 322  Filed 08/14/13  Page 12 of 17 \nI \n2  must not shrink from their obligation to 'enforce the constitutional rights of all persons. '\"  Plata, \n3 \n131 S. Ct. at 1928 (quoting Cruz v. Beta, 405 U.S. 319, 321 (1972)). \n4 \nIn crafting injunctive relief, the authority of the COUlt to appoint a monitor is well \n5 \nestablished.  Eldridge v. Carpenters 46, 94 F.3d 1366 (9th Cir. 1996) (holding that district \n6 \ncourt's failure to appoint a monitor was an abuse ofdiscretion where defendant insisted on \n7 \nretaining a hiring practice already held to be unlawfully discriminatory); Nat 'I Org. for the \n8 \nReform ofMarijuana Laws v. Mullen, 828 F.2d 536, 543 (9th Cir. 1987); Madrid v. Gomez, 889 \n9 \nF. Supp. 1146, 1282 (N .0. Cal. 1995) (holding that the \"assistance of a Special Master is clearly \n10 \nappropriate\" because \"[d]eveloping a comprehensive remedy in this case will be a complex \n1 1 \nundeltaking involving issues of a technical and highly charged nature\"). \n12 \nII. \t Appointment of an Independent Monitor Is Critical to Implementing Complex \nRemedies to Address Systemic Constitntional Violations. \n13 \nIn the experience of the United States, appointing a monitor can provide substantial \n14 \nassistance to COUtts and patties and can reduce unnecessary delays and litigation over disputes \n15 \nregarding compliance.  This is especially tme when institutional reform can be expected to take a \n16 \nnumber of years.  A monitor provides the independence and expertise necessary to conduct the \n17 \nobjective, credible analysis upon which a COUlt can rely to determine whether its order is being \n18 \nimplemented, and that gives the patties and the community confidence in the refonTI process.  A \n19 \nmonitor will also save the Court's time. \n20 \nIn Grant County, Washington, an independent monitor was essential to implementing the \n21 \nCOUlt's injunction in a right-to-counsel case.  Best et al. v.  Grant County, No. 04-2-00189-0 \n22 \n(Kittitas Cty. Sup. Ct., filed Dec. 21, 2004).  There, the monitor assisted the court and patties for \n23 \nalmost six years by conducting site visits, assessing caseloads, and completing quarterly reports \n24 \non the County's compliance with COUlt orders.  We note that the monitor's term in Grant County \n25 \nU.S . Statement of Interest  -7 ­ U .S. Depat1ment of Justice \nCase No. CII-OIIOO RSL  Civil Ri ghts Divi sion, Special Litigation Section \n950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW \nWashington, D.C. 20530 \n(202) 514-2000 \n\nCase 2:11-cv-OllOO-RSL  Document 322  Filed 08/14/13  Page 13 of 17 \n2  was limited from the outset to a defined period, and the monitor's final report noted work that \n3  still remained to be done. II In our experience, it is best to continue monitoring alTangements \n4  until the affected parties have demonstrated sustained compliance with the court's orders. \n5  In 2009, the United States entered a Memorandum of Agreement with King County, \n6  Washington to refolTn the King County COlTectional Facility. United States v. King County, \n7  Washington, No. 2:09-cv-00059 (W.D. Wash., filed Jan. 15,2009).  That successful refonn \n8  process was assisted by an independent monitor.  Other significant cases involving monitors \n9  include: United States v. City ofPittsburgh, No. 97-cv-354 (W.D. Pa., filed Feb. 26, 1997) \n10  (police; compliance reached in 1999); United States v. Dallas County, No. 3:07-cv-1559-N (N.D. \n11  Tex., filed Nov. 6, 2007) (jail); United States v. Delaware, No. l-ll-cv-591 (D. Del., filed Jun 6, \n12  20 11 ) (mental health system); United States v. City ofSeattle, No. 12-cv-1282 (W.D. Wash., \n13  filed July 27, 2012)(police).  In each of these cases, the independent monitor improved efficiency \n14  in implementation, decreased collateral litigation, and provided great assistance to the COUlt. 12 \n15  The selection of a monitor need not be a strictly top-down decision by the Court.  The \n16  parties may agree on who should fill the role of the monitor, but if they cannot, the Court can \n17  order them to nominate monitor candidates for the Court's consideration.  In addition, it should \n18  be noted that the cost of an independent monitor, however it is paid, should not reduce the funds \n19  available for indigent defense. \n20  Finally, it should be noted that the appointment of an independent monitor can ensure \n21  public confidence in the refOlm process.  With allegiance only to the Court and a duty to report \n22  its findings accurately and objectively, the monitor assures the public that the Cities will move \n23 \n24  11 The monitor's final report and two of its quarterly reports are attached as Exhibit 2. \nI.:! Summaries of those cases, re levant pleadings, and reports from the monitors can be found at \nhttp://www.justice.gov/crtlaboutispllfindsettle.php. \n25 \nU.S. Statement of Interest  -8 ­ U.S. Department of Justice \nCase No. CII-OIIOO RSL  Civil Right s Di vision, Special Lit igation Section \n950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW \nWashington , D.C. 20530 \n(202) 514-2000 \n\nCase 2:11-cv-OllOO-RSL  Document 322  Filed 08/14/13  Page 14 of 17 \n2  forward in implementing the Court's order, and will not escape notice if they do not.  Moreover, \n3  the Cities' progress towards implementing the COUlt'S order will be more readily accepted by a \n4  broader segment of the public if that progress is affirmed by a monitor who is responsible for \n5  confirming each claim of compliance asserted by the Cities. \n6  III. \t Ifthe Court Finds Liability in this Case, its Remedy Should Include Workload \nControls, Which Are Well-Suited to Implementation by an Independent Monitor. \n7 \nAchieving systemic reform to ensme meaningful access to counsel is an important, but \n8 \ncomplex and time-consuming, undertaking. Any remedy imposed by the COUlt may require \n9 \nyears of ~ssessment to determine whether it is accomplishing its purpose, and the Cmat and the \n10 \nparties may need independent assistance to resolve concerns about compliance. \nII \nOne source of complexity will be how the Court and parties assess whether public \n12 \ndefenders are overburdened.  In its Order for Further Briefing, the COUlt asked about \"hard\" \n13 \ncaseload standards, which provide valuable, blight-line rules that define the outer boundaries of \n14 \nwhat may be reasonably expected of public defenders.  ABA Ten Principles, supra.  However, \n15 \ncaseload limits alone cannot keep public defenders fi'om being overworked into ineffectiveness; \n16 \ntwo additional protections are required.  First, a public defender must have the authority to \n17 \ndecline appointments over the caseload limit.  Second, caseload limits are no replacement for a \n18 \ncareful analysis of a public defender's workload, a concept that takes into account all of the \n19 \nfactors affecting a public defender's ability to adequately represent clients, such as the \n20 \ncomplexity of cases on a defender's docket, the defender's skill and experience, the SUppOlt \n21 \nservices available to the defender, and the defender's other duties.  See id.  Making an accurate \n22 \nassessment of a defender's workload requires observation, record collection and analysis, \n23 \ninterviews with defenders and their supervisors, and so on, all of which must be performed \n24 \nquarterly or every six months over the course of several years to ensure that the Court's remedies \n25 \nu.s.  u.s. \nStatement of Interest  -9 ­ Department of Justice \nCase No. CII-OI IOORSl  Civil Rights Division, Special Litigation Section \n950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW \nWashington, D.C. 20530 \n(202) 514-2000 \n\nCase 2:11-cv-OllOO-RSL  Document 322  Filed 08/14113  Page 15 of 17 \n2  are being properly implemented.  The monitor can also assess whether, regardless of workload, \n3  defenders are carrying out other hallmarks of minimally effective representation, such as visiting \n4  clients, conducting investigations, performing legal research, and pursuing discovery.  ABA \n5  Standing Committee on Legal Aid and Indigent Defendants, Eight Guidelines ofPublic Defense \n6  Workloads (August 2009).  These kinds of detailed inquiries, carried out over sufficient time to \n7  ensure meaningful and long-lasting refonn, are critical to assessing whether the Cities are truly \n8  honoring misdemeanor defendants' right to counsel, and they can be made most efficiently and \n9  reliably by an independent monitor.  As shown in Exhibit 2, these are the kinds of inquires made \n10  by the independent monitor in the Grant County, Washington case.  Also, should non­\nII  compliance be identified, early and objective detection by the monitor, as well as the \n12  identification of barriers to compliance, allow the palties to undertake corrective action. \n13  An independent monitor may also obviate the need for the COUlt to dictate specific and \n14  rigid caseload requirements.  In the Shelby County juvenile justice enforcement matter, for \n15  example, the County is required to establish a juvenile defender program that provides defense \n16  attomeys with reasonable workloads, appropriate administrative supports, training, and the \n17  resources to provide zealous and independent representation to their clients, but the agreement \n18  does not specify a numerical caseload limit.  See Mem. of Agreement at 14-15. \n19  CONCLUSION \n20  Should the COUlt find for the Plaintiffs, it has broad powers to issue injunctive relief. \n21  That power includes the autholity to appoint an independent monitor who would assist the \n22  Court's efforts to ensure that any remedies ordered are effective, efficiently implemented, and \n23  achieve the intended result. \n24 \n25 \nU.S. Statement of Interest  - 10­ U.S. Department of Justice \nCase No. C11-01100 RSL  Civil Ri ght s Di vision, Special Litigation Section \n950 Pennsylvania A venue, NW \nWashington, D.C. 20530 \n(202) 514-2000 \n\nCase 2:11-cv-OllOO-RSL  Document 322  Filed 08/14/13  Page 16 of 17 \n2 \nRespectfully submitted, \n3 \nJOCELYN SAMUELS* \nActing Assistant Attorney General \n4 \nCivil Rights Division \nUnited States Department ofJustice \n5 \nROY L.

Box 2017\nGlens Falls, New York 12801\nFor Defendant Washington County\nDevine, J:\nPlaintiffs are allegedly indigent individuals who had criminal charges pending in\nOnondaga,Ontario, Schuyler, Suffolk and Washington Courities atthe time this action was\ncommenced. They commenced the action seeking a declaration that their constitutional rights\nwerebeing violated due to systemic deficiencies in the manner of providing a defense to indigent\nindividuals inthe five named counties and for injunctive relief requiring the state to provide a\n2\n\nsystem of public defense which complieswith the New York and United Sates Constitutions, as\nwell as state law, in such counties. Plaintiffs have now moved for class action certification to\nbring this action on behalf of all other indigent.persons who may be entitled to counsel atpublic\nexpense in such counties, now or in the future.\nDefendant Schuyler County has raised an objection to the timeliness of the motion,\ncontending that since it was served more than 60 days after said defendant served its answer the\nmotion is untimely. CPLR 902 requires amotion for class certification to be made within \"sixty\n. days after the time to serve aresponsive pleading has expired for all persons named as defendants\nin an action brought as a class action.\". The actual date of service of an answer is irrelevant.' .\nPursuant to a stipulation extending the time to answer, defendant Schuyler County's time to serve\nan answer expired on October 15, 2008. Furthermore, defendants Onondaga and Ontario\nCounties' time to serve an answer expired on October 24,2008. Given the multiple defendants,\nthis latter date governs the time for moving for class certification? .The motion was served on .\nDecember 5,2008, well within the 60-dayperiod, regardless of which date is used. Itis therefore\ndetermined that the motion is timely.\nOn amotion for class action certification, plaintiff must establish that\n\"the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, common questions\nof law or fact predominate ,over questions affecting only individual member, the claims or\ndefenses of the representative parties are typical of the class as a whole, the representative'\nparties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class, and a class action is\nsuperior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the\nSee Shah v Wilco Sys., Inc., 27 AD3d 169, 174 [1st Dept 2005].\n.1\n2 See e.g. Citibank, [N.Y. State], N.A. v Suthers, 68 AD2d 790, 794 [4th Dept 1979]).\n.3\n\ncontroversy\".'\nEach requirement is an essential prerequisite to class action certification, and whether\neach has been established by the representative plaintiffs is a decision that 'rests within the sound\ndiscretion of the trial court'.\"\nPlaintiffs seek to define the class as \"all indigent persons who have or will have criminal .\nfelony, misdemeanor or lesser charges pending against them in New York state courts in\nOnondaga, Ontario, Schuyler, Suffolk and Washington counties who are entitled to rely on the\ngovernment of New York to provide them with meaningful and effective defense counsel.\" With\nrespect to the first requirement, plaintiffs have shown that there were more than 46,000 indigent\ncriminal defendants in 2007 in the five defendant counties. Itis certainly likely that the numbers\nare similar for 2008 and will be into the future. Clearly, joinder of all ofthe members of the\nclass, many of whom will not qualify as members until they are charged with a crime, would be\nimpracticable. Indeed, this class definition may be so numerous as to give rise to significant\ndifficulties by increasing the possibility of conflicts of interest,\" as well as making class\n.notification, if found to be warranted pursuant to CPLR 904 (a), extremely problematic.\nPlaintiffs also contend that common questions of law and fact predominate over\n3 Rife v Barnes Firm, P.C., 48 AD3d 1228, 1229 [2008], lv dismissed and denied 10\nNY3d 910 [2008]; see CPLR901 (a); see also Rallis v City of New York, 3 AD3d 525, 526\n[2004]; Solomon v Bell Atl.

Co., 231 AD2d 126~\n130 [1997]).\" (Alix v Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 57 AD3d 1044, 1045, [3d Dept 2008]).\n5 See Alix v Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 16 Mise.3d 844, 851,[Sup Ct, Albany County 2007,\naffd 57 AD3d 1044 [3d Dept 2008].\n4\n\nindividual issues. Plaintiffs have.repeatedly stated that the instant action challenges a systemic\ndeficiency in the manner in which defense services are provided to indigent defendants. The\nalleged harm is an abstract risk of being deprived of constitutional rights, rather than a specific,\nindividual deprivation. They have consistently argued that the actual facts of each individual\nplaintiffs case are of little relevance. Moreover, plaintiffs do not seek any monetary damages.\nThe only relief sought is declaratory and injunctive in nature. While there may indeed be\nsignificant differences in the deficiencies, if any, in the five different counties, which provide\ncriminal defense services in distinctly different manners, they are not differences attributable to\nthe circumstances of the individual class members. Moreover, there has been no showing that\nthe differences between the.five counties are so significant as to require severance of the claims\nwith respect to individualcounties, In any event, the CPLR expressly provides for thé division of\na class into subclasses if warranted,\" Thus, in theory, each ofthe five counties could be analyzed\nseparately, with differing declaratory and injunctive relief provided, even though the action was\nproceeding as a class action.\nPlaintiffs must also establish that the claims or defenses' of the representative plaintiffs\nare typical of those ofthe entire class. Defendants contend that plaintiffs can not meet this\nrequirement due to the significant differences in the defense services received by each of the\nnamed plaintiffs and the differences between the five counties' criminal defense systems .:\nHowever, as noted above, the plaintiffs' claims are not based upon the actual representation\nreceived by the named plaintiffs. Rather, plaintiffs rely upon allegations of systemic deficiencies\nwhich are on their face similar for all the named plaintiffs, as well as all class members,\n6 See CPLR 906.\n5\n\n· '\nregardless ofthe quality of representation actually received or whether criminal defense services\nareprovided through apublic defender, assigned counselor aprivate legal aid bureau or society.\nDefendants have not shown that they have any defenses to the claims of.systemic deficiencies\nwhich significantly differ betweenthe named plaintiffs and the un-named members ofthe class.\nThe named plaintiffs must also show that they will -fairlyand adequately protect the\ninterests of the entire class. Most, ifnot all, ofthe criminal prosecutions of the named plaintiffs\nhave concluded and, as such, they have no current actual interest in the litigation. Moreover,\nmost ofthe named plaintiffs live significant distances from Albany County, Itis likely that they\nare still burdened by limited financial resources to pay for travel to Albany for any pre-trial\nproceedings or for trial. None of the named plaintiffs have submitted current affidavits\nindicating awillingness actively to litigate this matter. Plaintiffs have noted orilyfour affidavits\nfrom early 2008 in which the affiants stated in an entirely conclusoryfashion that they joined the\nlawsuit in order to help others get adequate representation.\nThus, the extent to which the named plaintiffs will actively participate in this litigation is\nquestionable. However, plaintiffs have shown that their attorneys have sufficient experience and\nability adequately to litigate this matter. Moreover, itis possible, ifnot likely, that their\norganizational purposes would be sufficient to overcome any lack of interest by the individual\nnamed plaintiffs, providing areasonable guarantee that the matter wouldbe actively and\nvigorously pursued.\nThere is, however, a significant possible tension between the claims of the named\nplaintiffs and some of the members of the proposed class. The named plaintiffs seek only\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief. There is no claim for monetary damages. Itis certainly.\n6\n\n·possible that some of the members of the class have valid causes of action for legal malpractice\nagainst their defense counsel. While such claims clearly constitute a separate and distinct cause.\nof action from the claim of a systemic deficiency in the provision of indigent defense services,\nthe principles of resjudicata bar further litigation between the same parties as to causes of action\nwhich were or could have been raised.\" As long as the claims arise out of the same transaction or\nseries of transactions, they are barredregardless of whether they are based upon different legal\ntheoriesor seek different relief\" Claims of legal malpractice certainly arise out of the same\nseries of transactions which give rise to the claim of an unacceptable likelihood of a deprivation\nof meaningful and effective assistance of counsel. Since public defenders are county employees,\nthe counties which utilize a public defender could be sued under the theory of respondeat\nsuperior, thereby meeting the requirement of an identity ofparties. Plaintiffs have thus failed to\nshow that the named representative parties would fairly and adequately protect the interests of the\nentire class, including those with viable causes of action for money damages.\"\nFinally, the Court finds that plaintiffs have failed to show that a class action would be\ná\nsuperior to other alternatives in obtaining a fair and efficient adjudication of the issues. When\nproposed class action challenges governmental operations, and when a determination of an\nindividual claim would effectively provide reliefto the entire proposed class through the\n7See Jackson vJarnaica Hosp. Med. Ctr., 61 AD3d 1166, 1167 [3d Dept 2009].\n8See Landau P.C. v LaRossa, Mitchell &Ross, 11NY3d 8, 12 [2008].\n9 See Small v LoriHard Tobacco Co:, 94NY2d 43, 54 [1999].\n7\n\noperation of stare decisis, class certification is unnecessary and not warranted. to\nThe lack of need for class certification is even more compelling in the instant action. Plaintiffs\nseek a declaration that indigent criminal defendants' general rights to assistance of counsel are\nbeing violated together with injunctive relief to restructure the entire system of providing a\ndefense to indigent criminal defendants. They have repeatedly stated that the facts and\nCircumstances' of any individual plaintiff are not at issue. Presumably, if they prevail, an entirely\nnew, or significantly modified, system would replace the current system. The current alleged\ndeficiencies would be corrected and there would be no need for any further litigation by would be\nclass members based upon stare decisis. Indeed, any new deficiencies in the system would likely\nrequire anew action or proceeding, as they would not have been covered by the final judgment\nwhich may be entered herein.\nPlaintiffs have not shown that there would be any actual benefit from class action\ncertification. Clearly, plaintiffs may rely upon current indigent criminal defendants with\ncompelling histories as.non-party witnesses or may move to add such individuals as named\nparties, without requiring class action certification. They have also failed to show that any of the\nexceptions to the government operations principle are applicable. Plaintiffs do not seek a\n\"complex injunction\" applicable to individual criminal prosecutions. There has been no showing\nof a likelihood of a need for individual actions to enforce the terms of the injunctive relief which\nto See MahoneyvPataki, 98NY2d45, 55 [2002];MatterofMartin v Lavine, 39NY2d\n72, 75 [1976]; Matter of Jones v Berman, 37 NY2d 42,57 [1975]; Matter of Legal Aid Sacy. v\nNew York City Police Dept., 274AD2d 207,213 [1st Dept 2000].\n8\n\nmay be granted herein\" or to recover small monetary amounts such that lack of class certification\n. might effectively preclude relief to indigent persons.\" Furthermore, there has been no showing\nthat the defendants have ignored or are likely to ignore court orders.\" Finally, while plaintiffs\ncontend that there is an immediate threat of deprivation of constitutional rights, there has been no\nshowing that irijunctivereliefwhich might be granted in the instant action without class\ncertification would be insufficient to mitigate the threat for all members of the would be class or\nthat any individual determinations would be required.\"\nPlaintiffs also contend that class action certification is necessary because the individual\nplaintiffs' claims are almost certain to become moot before the merits ofthis action can be\nto\ndetermined. However; the issues are of significant importance, are almost certain recur, and\nwould be likely to evade judicial review if no exception to the mootness doctrine was applied.\"\nAs such, dismissal on the ground of mootness is very unlikely. Indeed, plaintiffs must rely upon\na similar exception to maintain the proposed class action as the claims of the nanied plaintiffs\nCf New York City Coalition to End Lead Poisoning v Giuliani, 245 AD2d 49,51-52\n11\n[1st Dept 1997].\nCf Tindell v Koch, 164 AD2d 689,695 [1st Dept 1991]; Ousmane v City of New\n12\nYork, 7Misc.3d 1016(A) [Sup Ct, New York County 2005].\n13See Matter of Legal Aid Socy. v New York City Police Dept., 274 AD2d at213; New\nYork CitY,Coalition to End Lead Poisoning v Giuliani, 245 AD2d at 52.\n14 Cf New York City Coalition to End Lead Poisoning v Giuliani, 245 AD2d at 51-52.\n15See Matter of Hearst Corp. v Clyne, 50NY2d 707, 714-715 [1980]; Matter of Jones v\nBerman, 37 NY2d at 57; Matter ofVanderminden v Tarantino, 60 AD3d 55,57-58 [3d Dept\n2009].\n9\n\nbecome moot by termination of their criminal proceedings.\"\nInasmuch as plaintiffs have failed to show that they will fairly and adequately protect the\ninterests ofthe entire class or that a class action would be superior to other alternatives in\nobtaining a fair and efficient adjudication ofthe issues, their motion for class action certification\nishereby denied.\nThis memorandum constitutes both the DECISION and ORDER of the Court.

This civil rights lawsuit is brought to remedy the State of New York's persistent \nfailure to guarantee meaningful and effective legal representation to indigent people accused of \ncrimes, as required by the New York State Constitution and laws and the United States \nConstitution. \n2.  New York State was once a leader in guaranteeing the right to counsel to indigent \npeople accused of crimes.  In 1881, more than eighty years before the United States Supreme \nCourt established the right to counsel in felony cases under the federal constitution in Gideon v. \nWainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963), the New York State Legislature adopted section 308 of the \n\nCriminal Procedure Law, directing courts to appoint pro bono C01111sel for unrepresented felony \ndefendants. \n3.  Sadly today, more than forty years after Gideon, the leadership and humanity \nNew York State showed in the past have eroded badly.  In the last few decades, dozens of \nreports, commissions, newspaper investigations, and lawsuits documented the degree to which \nthose accused of crimes in New York State are denied basic constitutional protections. \n4.  Most recently, in June of 2006, the New York State Commission on the Future of \nIndigent Defense Services, which was convened by Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye, issued a \ncomprehensive report detailing the crisis in New York's public defense system.  After careful \nstudy of data from all across the state, the Kaye Commission concluded that \"the indigent \ndefense system in New York State is both severely dysfunctional and structurally incapable of \nproviding each poor defendant with the effective legal representation that he or she is guaranteed \nby the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution and laws of the State of New York \n... [and] has resulted in a disparate, inequitable, and ineffective system for securing \nconstitutional guarantees to those too poor to obtain counsel of their own choosing.\"l \n5.  Despite the Kaye Commission's uneqnivocal statement that the State is now \nknowingly and systematically violating the fundamental rights of its poorest citizens to \nmeaningful and effective legal representation in criminal cases, more than a year has passed \nwithout any action by the State to remedy the problem. \n6.  Plaintiffs Kimberly Hurrell-Harring, James Adams, Joseph Briggs, Ricky Lee \nGlover, Richard Love, Jr., Jacqueline Winbrone, Lane Loyzelle, Tosha Steele, Bruce \nWashington, Shawn Chase, Jemar Johnson, Robert Tomberelli, Christopher Yaw, Luther \n1 The Final Report of the New York State Commission on the Future of Indigent Defense is \nattached to this complaint and is thereby incorporated by reference pursuant to CPLR § 3014. \n2 \n\nWoodrow of Booker, Jr., Edward Kaminski, Joy Metzler, Victor Turner, Candace Brookins, \nRandy Habshi, and Ronald McIntyre are among the thousands of defendants currently affected \nby the structural and systemic failings of the public defense system identified by the Kaye \nCommission.  Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit on behalf of themselves and of all indigent persons \nwith criminal felony, misdemeanor, or lesser charges pending in New York state courts in \nOnondaga, Ontario, Schuyler, Suffolk and Washington counties (hereinafter, \"the Counties\") \nwho are entitled to rely on the govemrnent of New York to provide them with meaningful and \neffective defense counsel. \n7.  The State of New York's broken public defense system has deteriorated to the \npoint where it now deprives or threatens to deprive these plaintiffs and the class of indigent \ndefendants they represent of rights guaranteed to them by article I, section 6 of the New York \nState Constitution; sections 170.10, 180.10, 180.80, 190.50, and 210.15(2)(c) of the New York \nCriminal Procedure Law; sections 717 and 722-c of the New York County Law; and the Sixth \nand Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and \ninjunctive relief against the State of New York to prevent violations of plaint iffs' legal rights and \nto remedy the State's continuing failure to ensure that plaintiffs and the class they represent \nreceive meaningful and effective legal representation. \n8.  The Constitution and laws of the State of New York and the United States \nConstitution guarantee all persons facing criminal charges the right to counsel, even if they \ncarmot afford a lawyer.  It has long been established that the State is obligated to provide public \ndefense counsel to such persons at every critical stage of the criminal jnstice process. \n9.  The right to counsel is a right to meaningfitl and effective assistance of counsel. \nConstitutionally adequate counsel is counsel that is capable of putting the prosecution'S case to \n3 \n\nmeaningful adversarial testing.  Where, as is the case in New York, public defense counsel do \nnot have the resources and the tools to engage actively and meaningfully in the adversarial \nprocess, courts cannot ensure that their decisions, judgments, verdicts and punishments are \nrendered fairly and accurately. \n10.  The constitutional and statutory obligation to provide indigent defendants with \nmeaningful and effective assistance of counsel rests with the State.  Since 1965, the State has \nabdicated its responsibility to guarantee the right to counsel for indigent persons and has left \neach of its sixty-two counties to establish, fund and administer their own public defense \nprograms, with little or no fiscal and administrative oversight or funding from the State. \nII.  Because of this abdication of responsibility, the public defense systems in the \nCounties suffer from some combination of the following deficiencies, among others: incoherent \nor excessively restrictive client eligibility standards; no written hiring and performance standards \nor meaningful systems for attorney supervision and monitoring; lack of adequate attorney \ntraining; a lack of resources for support staff, appropriate investigations and expert services; no \nattorney caseload or workload standards; an absence of consistent representation of each client \nby one lawyer; a lack of independence from the judiciary, the prosecutorial function, and \npolitical authorities; and inadequate resources and compensation for public defense service \nproviders, especially as compared to their prosecutorial counterparts. \n12.  As a result of these deficiencies, many public defense providers in the Counties \noften fail to: provide representation for indigent defendants at all critical stages of the criminal \njustice process, especially arraignments where bail determinations are made; meet or consult \nwith clients prior to critical stages in their criminal proceedings; investigate adequately the \ncharges against their clients or obtain investigators who can assist with case preparation and \n4 \n\ntestifY at trial; employ and consult with experts when necessary; file necessary pre-trial motions; \nor provide meaningful representation at trial and at sentencing. \n13.  The inability of public defense counsel to put the case against their clients to \nmeaningful adversarial testing causes the class ofindigent defendants to suffer numerous harms, \nincluding but not limited to: wrongful denial of representation; unnecessary or prolonged pre \ntrial detention; excessive or inappropriate bail determinations, which have been shown in \nincrease the likelihood of conviction; waiver of meritorious defenses; guilty pleas to \ninappropriate charges; guilty pleas taken without adequate knowledge and awareness of the full, \ncollateral consequences of the pleas; wrongful conviction of crimes; harsher sentences than the \nfacts ofthe case warrant and few alternatives to incarceration; and waiver of the right to appeal \nand other post-conviction rights. \n14.  This complaint focuses on how the State's failure to provide funding and fiscal \nand administrative oversight has created a broken public defense system in Onondaga, Ontario, \nSchuyler, Suffolk and Washington Counties, but the failings in those counties and the types of \nharms suffered by the named plaintiffs are by no means limited or unique to the named CO\\U1ties. \nThe State's failure to provide funding or oversight to any of New York's counties has caused \nsimilar problems throughout the State. \nIS.  As a direct result of the State's refusal to oversee, set standards for, and \nadequately fund public defense, indigent criminal defendants in the Counties and across the state \nface a severe and unacceptably high risk of not receiviug meaningful and effective assistance of \ncounsel.  In the words of the Kaye Commission, \"New York's current fragmented system of \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed indigent defense services fails to satisfY the state's \nconstitutional and statutory obligations to protect the rights of the indigent accused.\" \n5 \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPARTIES .......................................................................................................8  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE ................................................................................... 11 \nTHE STATE'S FAILURE TO PROVIDE CONSTITUTIONALLY \nAND LEGALLY ADEQUATE PUBLIC DEFENSE SERVICES .................................... 12 \nThe Impact ofthe Public Defense Crisis on the Plaintiffs ..................................... 12 \nThe Right to Counsel in New York State ........................................................5 6 \nThe State's Abdication of Responsibility to the Counties .....................................5 7 \nThe Lack ofE  nforceable, Statewide Standards ....................................... .58 \nThe Lack ofS tate Supervision and Oversight .......................................... 59 \nThe Lack ofA dequate State Funds for Public Defense Services .....................6 0 \nThe Kaye Commission on the Future ofIndigent Defense's \nIndictment of New York's Public Defense System ............................................. 61 \nNew York State's Long History of Violating the Right to \nCounsel for Indigent Defendants ............. \" ...................................................6 3 \nThe Statewide Failure to Meet Basic Standards of Constitutional \nLegal Representation ............................................................................... 67 \nInadequate Staffing and the Failure to Provide Representation to \nIndigent Defendants At All Critical Stages ............................................. 68 \nIncoherent or Excessively Restrictive Financial Eligibility \nStandards and Delays in the Appointment ofCounsel ................................7 2 \nLack ofA ttorney-Client Contact and Communication ................................7 7 \nLack ofA  ttorney Hiring Criteria, Performance Standards \nand Supervisory Controls ................................................................. 80 \nLack ofT raining ........................................................................... 83 \nLack ofS upport Services and the Failure to Conduct \nInvestigations and Seek Expert Services ................................................ 85 \n6 \n\nExcessive Caseloads and/or Workloads ................................................ 88 \nLack of Vertical Representation ..........................................................9 0 \nThe Lack ofP  olitical and Professional Independence ................................9 1 \nInadequate Compensation and Lack ofP  arity \nwith Prosecutorial Counterparts .........................................................9 4 \nThe Effect of the Public Defense Crisis on Indigent Criminal Defendants ..................9 8 \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS ...................................................................................9 9 \nOTHER ALLEGATIONS ................................................................................. 1 01 \nCLAIMS ..................................................................................................... 101 \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF .................................................................................. .102 \n7 \n\nPARTIES \nPlaintiffs \n16.

Defendant GOVERNOR DAVID PATERSON is the Governor of the State of \nNew York and as such is responsible for enforcing the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the \nU.S. Constitution as they apply to the provision of public defense services within New York \nState.  The Governor also possesses specific administrative and fiscal authority to manage, \noversee, set standards for, and fund public defense services in tlle State.  In 2008, for example, \n11 \n\nthen-Governor Eliot Spitzer proposed legislation in the form ofa \"governor's bill\" that would \nhave provided funding for a statewide office with specific responsibilities related to the provision \nof public defense services in New York.

Mrs. Hurrell-Harring was arrested on September 29, 2007, and charged with one \ncount of introduction of prison contraband in the first degree, a felony, and possession of \nmarijuana, a violation.  Mrs. Hnrrell-Harring was accused of bringing 22.1 grams, or about % of \none ounce, of marijuana to her incarcerated husband for his personal use.  She faces up to seven \nyears imprisomnent and up to $5000 in fines. \n12 \n\n41.  Mrs. Hurrell-Harring was not represented at her arraignment, where, despite her \nlack of prior criminal history, bail was set at $10,000 cash or $20,000 bond.  Mrs. HurreIl-\nHarring could not afford to post bail and was remanded to the Washington County Jail, where \nshe remains. \n42.  Mrs. Hurrell-Harring first met her attorney at the county jail shortly after her \narraignment.  During this meeting, Mrs. Hurrell-Harring felt that her attorney took no interest in \nher case, her family, or her future.  Mrs. Hurrell-Harring's attorney has refused to take any calls \nshe has made to his office since this initial interview. \n43.  Although Mrs. Hurrell-Harring strongly hoped for probation, so that she could \ncontinue to support her family, her attorney did not move to reduce the felony charge to \npromoting prison contraband in the second degree, a misdemeanor, despite clear precedent \nholding that the lesser charge is the appropriate one given the small amount of marijuana \ninvolved.  See, e.g., People v. Stanley, 19 A.D. 3d 1152, 1152,796 N.Y.S.2d 767 768, (4th Dept. \n2005); People v. Brown, 2 A.D.3d 1216,1216,769 N.Y.S.2d 657,657 (3d Dept. 2003).  On \ninformation and belief, Mrs. Hurrell-Harring's attomey also failed to advocate for a plea bargain \nto reduced charges andlor probation given the circumstances of her offense, her lack of a prior \nrecord, and her family situation. \n44.  On October 12,2007, having been incarcerated for several weeks and presented \nwith no other options, Mrs. Hurrell-Harring pled guilty to promoting prison contraband in the \nfirst degree.  During the court proceeding in which she pled guilty, it was clear that her attomey \nhad not informed her of the full consequences of the plea prior to her decision to enter it. \n45.  Ms. Hurrell-Harring will be sentenced on November 16, 2007.  Based on her plea \nbargain, she expects to be sentenced to six months imprisonment and five years of probation.  As \n13 \n\na result of this felony conviction, Mrs. Hurrell-Harring stands to rose her license to serve as a \nregistered nurse, a profession she has served in for twelve years. \n46.  The State of New York has not provided Mrs. Hurrell-Harring with the \nrepresentation to which she is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as she was not \nrepresented at all critical stages; has not had sufficient opportunity to discuss with her attorney \nthe factual basis for the charges against her, to participate in building a defense to those charges, \nor to make informed decisions regarding the progress and disposition of her case; and has been \ndenied investigative services, motions practice and vigorous advocacy that could have \ncontributed to her defense and/or brought an end to unnecessary incarceration. Upon information \nand belief, the State of New York will continue to fail to provide Mrs. Hurrell-Harring with the \nlegal representation to which she is entitled as her case proceeds. \n47.  The representation provided to Mrs. Hurrell-Harring is illustrative of the pattern \nof representation provided to indigent defendants in the Counties and results from of the \nstructural and systemic failings that led the Kaye Commission to conclude that New York State \nis failing to meet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, \nincluding the absence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate funding of the \ncurrent county-operated and largely county-fmanced public defense system. \nJames Adams (Onondaga County) \n48.  James Adams was arrested on July 31, 2007, and charged with robbery in the \nthird degree, burglary in the third degree, and harassment in the second degree, all felonies.  Mr. \nAdams is accused of shoplifting several sticks of deodorant from a drug store.  If convicted, Mr. \nAdams faces a maximum sentence of fourteen years imprisonment on these charges. \n14 \n\n49.  Mr. Adams was represented by an attorney at his arraignment but was assigned a \ndifferent attorney during the arraignment.  Bail was set at $2500, which Mr. Adams could not \nafford. \n50.  Mr. Adams has never seen his attorney outside of open court.  Mr. Adams first \nsaw his attorney at a court appearance on August 7,2007.  During this appearance, Mr. Adams's \nattorney asked for a one-week adjournment because he had neither reviewed his client's file nor \nhad time to prepare for the hearing.  Mr. Adams's attorney was not even aware that his client was \nincarcerated.  When the hearing ended, Mr. Adams asked his attorney for a chance to speak \nabout his about his case, but Mr. Adams's attorney did not meet with him. \n51.  On August 14 and September 4,2007, Mr. Adams again appeared in court.  Both \ntimes, his case was adjourned.  On each occasion, Mr. Adams asked his attorney for a meeting, \nbut no meeting occurred.  During these court appearances, the judge encouraged the prosecutor \nand defense counsel to negotiate the felony burglary and robbery charges down to misdemeanor \npetit larceny, but the attorneys did not do so. \n52.  On September ·18, 2007, Mr. Adams appeared in court again but his attorney did \nnot appear.  The prosecutor attempted to present Mr. Adams with a notice that his felony charges \nhad been referred to a Grand Jury, but the judge admonished the prosecutor that notice must be \nserved on Mr. Adams's counsel.  During this appearance, Mr. Adams heard the prosecutor tell \nthe judge that he had extended a plea offer to Mr. Adams.  Mr. Adams's attorney never \ncommunicated that offer to Mr. Adams . \n. 53.  Mr. Adams wanted to discuss the possibility of exercising his right to appear \nbefore the Grand Jury with his attorney but, unable to reach his attorney, Mr. Adams lost his \n15 \n\nopportunity to do so.  Mr. Adams was indicted on felony burglary and robbery charges on \nSeptember 21, 2007. \n54.  Mr. Adams has attempted to contact his attorney several times between his court \nappearances, but his attorney's dedicated voicemail box is always full and his office does not \naccept collect phone calls from the jail.  Mr. Adams's wife also has called his attorney several \ntimes, but the attorney never returned her calls.  Mr. Adams contacted Jail Ministry, a prisoner \nrights organization, to ask them to call his attorney on his behalf, but Mr. Adams's attorney still \nnever contacted him. \n55.  On September 25,2007, Mr. Adams attempted to file his own pro se motion \nunder NY CPL § 190.80, which generally requires release of any person accused of a felony who \nhas not been indicted within forty-five days of arrest. Without an attorney to provide counsel, he \nsimply mailed form papers obtained from the prison law library and he is not sure whether he \nproperly filed his motion. \n56.  Still unable to reach his attorney, Mr. Adams wrote directly to the district attorney \non October 3, 2007, explaining the facts of his case and alleging that he had been misidentified \nby the prosecution's witnesses. \n57.  During a court appearance on October 5, 2007, Mr. Adams hand-delivered a letter \nto his attorney and to the prosecutor complaining about the lack of attorney-client \ncommunication and explaining the possible misidentification.  During this court appearance, \nwithout prompting from Mr. Adams's attorney, the judge expressed concern that Mr. Adams had \nbeen overcharged for felony burglary and robbery for allegedly stealing deodorant from a drng \nstore.  The judge suggested that because of this concern he would review the Grand Jury \n16 \n\nminutes.  Despite these statements from the judge questioning the basis for the indictment, Mr. \nAdams's attorney did not file a motion to dismiss the indictment. \n58.  During his most recent court appearance, on October 19,2007, the judge ordered \nMr. Adams's attorney to file a motion to dismiss the indictment.  As with his prior court \nappearances, Mr. Adams's attorney did not speak to Mr. Adams before or after the appearance. \n59.  Mr. Adams has not had any contact with his attorney in nearly a month and does \nnot know the status of his case.  Mr. Adams has spent many hours in the jail law library trying to \nunderstand what it means to dismiss an indictment and what the judge's suggestion to file this \nmotion means for his case. \n60.  As of the filing of this complaint, Mr. Adams has been incarcerated for more than \nthree months for allegedly stealing deodorant from a drug store.  Mr. Adams's next court \nappearance is scheduled for November 30,2007, at which time he will have been incarcerated \nfor four months. \n61.  As a result of his arrest and incarceration, Mr. Adams, lost his job as a day laborer \nand is unable to support his wife, his two teenage daughters, and his granddaughter.  Mr. \nAdams's family was evicted from their home because they could not afford to pay rent without \nhis income. \n62.  The State of New York has failed to provide Mr. Adams with the representation \nto which he is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as he has not had sufficient \nopportunity to discuss his case with his attorney, to participate in building a defense to the charge \nagainst him, or to make informed decisions regarding the progress and disposition of his case; \nhas been deprived of investigative assistance, motions practice and vigorous advocacy that may \ncontribute to a favorable resolution of the charge against him andlor an end to unnecessary \n17 \n\nincarceration; and does not understand where his case stands or the status of the charges against \nhim.  Upon information and belief, the State of New York will continue to fail to provide Mr. \nAdams with the legal representation to which he is entitled as his case proceeds. \n63.  The representation provided to Mr. Adams is illustrative of the pattern of \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants in the Counties and results from the structural and \nsystemic failings that led the Kaye Commission to conclude that New York State is failing to \nmeet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, including the \nabsence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate funding of the current \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed public defense system. \nJoseph Briggs (Onondaga County) \n64.  Joseph Briggs was arrested on August 7, 2007, and charged with possession of \nstolen property in the third degree, a felony.  Because of prior felony convictions, Mr. Briggs \nfaces a maximwn life sentence if convicted of these charges. \n65.  Prior to his arrest, Mr. Briggs was a self-employed roofer who was attempting to \nstart his own small roofing business. \n66.  Mr. Briggs was not represented by an attorney at his arraigwnent, at which he was \ndenied bail. \n67.  Mr. Briggs first saw his attorney at a court appearance on September 4, 2007, \nalmost a month after his arrest and incarceration. In the preceding weeks, Mr. Briggs, who was \neager to speak to his attorney about his case and ask about the possibility of a bail reduction so \nhe could get back to work, learned that his attorney had adjourned several court appearances \nwithout consulting him.  While awaiting this court appearance, Mr. Briggs asked the court \n18 \n\ndeputy to ask his lawyer to come speak to him in the holding cell to discuss his case and prepare \nfor the appearance, but Mr. Briggs's attorney did not do so. \n68.  Mr. Briggs next saw his attorney on September 10, 2007, in a meeting that lasted \napproximately five minutes.  After that brief meeting, Mr. Briggs attempted on numerous \noccasions to contact his attorney from the jail, but his attorney's dedicated voicemail box was \nalways full and his office did not accept collect calls from the jail. Mr. Briggs also wrote to his \nattorney but never received any response. \n69.  Mr. Briggs was indicted on September 19, 2007.  Mr. Briggs's attorney never \nconsulted with him before waiving his right to a preliminary hearing and never discussed with \nhim his right to testify before the Grand Jury. \n70.  Mr. Briggs next appeared in court on October 10, 2007.  Mr. Briggs's attorney did \nnot appear in court on that day.  The judge asked Mr. Briggs ifhe would like to get a new \nattorney. Mr. Briggs said yes, and the judge assigned a new attorney. \n71.  Mr. Briggs has never met or spoken with his new attorney.  He has written to her \nthree times and tried to call his new attorney but her voicemail box is always full and her office \ndoes not accept collect calls from the jail.  Meanwhile, Mr. Briggs has been unable to discuss \nwith his attorney the possibility of moving to dismiss the indictment because he was denied an \nopportunity to testifY before the Grand Jury, file other motions for release based on his prolonged \nand unnecessary pretrial incarceration, or obtain a copy of his file because his attorney has not \nresponded to these letters. \n72.  Mr. Briggs contacted Jail Ministry, a prisoner rights organization, to ask for its \nhelp in contacting his attorney, but Jail Ministry told him that it had passed along so many \n19 \n\ncomplaints about lack of attomey-client contact to that particular attomey that she had instructed \nthe organization never to call her about her clients again. \n73.  Mr. Briggs's next court date is not scheduled until December 7, 2007.  Mr. \nBriggs, who has been incarcerated since August 7,2007, does not understand why his next court \ndate is so far away or what is happening with his case. \n74.  Upon information and belief, neither of Mr. Briggs's attorneys has conducted any \nindependent investigation into the facts surrounding Mr. Briggs's case or the existence of any \npossible defenses that might be available to him. \n75.  The State of New York has failed to provide Mr. Briggs with the representation to \nwhich he is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as he has not been represented in all \ncritical proceedings; has not had snfficient opportunity to discuss his case with his attorney, to \nparticipate in building a defense to the charge against him, or to make an informed decision \nabout the progress and disposition of his case; has been SUbjected to lengthy and urrnecessary \npretrial incarceration; and does not understand where his case stands or the status of the charges \nagainst him.  Upon information and belief, the State of New York will continue to fail to provide \nMr. Briggs with the legal representation to which he is entitled as his case proceeds. \n76.  The representation provided to Mr. Briggs is illustrative of the pattern of \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants in the Counties and results from the structural and \nsystemic failings that led the Kaye Commission to conclude that New York State is failing to \nmeet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, including the \nabsence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate funding of the current \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed public defense system. \n20 \n\nRicky Lee Glover (Onondaga County) \n77.  Ricky Lee Glover was arrested on June 12,2007, and charged with burglary in the \nthird degree, a felony, and related misdemeanor charges of petit larceny and possession of \nburglary tools. Because of prior felony convictions, the maximum sentence Mr. Glover faces on \nthese charges is life imprisonment. \n78.  Mr. Glover was represented at arraignment by an attorney, but was assigned to a \nsecond attorney during the arraignment.  He was denied bail and remanded to jail, where he \nremains. \n79.  After arraignment, Mr. Glover immediately tried to contact his new attorney but \nhis attorney's dedicated voicemail box was consistently full and her office would not accept \ncollect calls from the jail. \n80.  Mr. Glover met his attorney only once, on JllIle 2!, 2007, in the jail.  According to \na grievance filed on behalf of Mr. Glover by the Onondaga County Human Rights Commission, \nduring that meeting, which lasted only a few minutes, Mr. Glover's attorney informed him that \nhe had a \"dead case\" even though she admitted that she had not obtained and reviewed any files. \nfrom the prosecutor or conducted any discovery or independent investigation.  Mr. Glover asked \nhis attorney to advocate for bail but she did not do so.  Mr. Glover has not seen his attorney since \nthis first meeting more than four months ago. \n8!.  During their first and only meeting, again according to Mr. Glover's grievance, \nMr. Glover specifically asked his attorney not to waive his right to a preliminary hearing.  Mr. \nGlover's attorney adjourned his first scheduled preliminary hearing on JllIle 15, 2007.  On June \n29,2007, Mr. Glover's attorney, against his specific instructions, waived Mr. Glover's right to a \npreliminary hearing in a letter to the judge. \n21 \n\n82.  On July 10, 2007, having been unable to reach his attorney for over a month, Mr. \nGlover filed his own pro se motion for release under NY CPL § 180.80, which generally requires \nrelease of any person accused of a felony who has been held for more than 120 hours after arrest \nwithout a preliminary hearing.  Mr. Glover was unaware that his attorney had already waived his \npreliminary hearing.  Mr. Glover only found out that his right had been waived months later \nwhen he called the Onondaga County Human Rights Commission. \n83.  Since their frrst and only meeting in June, Mr. Glover has neither met with his \nattorney nor been able to reach her by telephone.  Mr. Glover's family has also attempted to \nreach his attorney several times.  On one occasion, Mr. Glover's mother was able to reach his \nattorney, who told his mother that Mr. Glover was \"about to get out.\"  Months later, Mr. Glover \nremains in jail. \n84.  On October 6,2007, Mr. Glover, still unable to reach his attorney, filed his own \npro se motion under NY CPL § 190.80, which generally requires release of any person accused \nof a felony who has not been indicted within 45 days of arrest. Without an attorney to provide \ncounsel, Mr. Glover did not know where to file the motion and remains unsure whether it was \nproperly filed. \n85.  On October 15,2007, Mr. Glover leamed that the felony charges he was facing \nhad been reduced to misdemeanor charges.  He learned this because an attomey grievance \ncommittee forwarded a copy of a letter his attorney had written to that committee defending her \nrepresentation of Mr. Glover against his complaint.  His attorney never communicated this \ninformation to Mr. Glover; he would not have known if he had not received this letter from the \ngrievance committee. \n22 \n\n86.  Since learning his charges were reduce~ Mr. Glover has been researching in the \njail law library whether he can file his own motion for a bail reduction so he can get out of \npretrial detention. \n87.  Mr. Glover's attorney also represents him on pending traffic violations in the \nOnondaga Town Court.  Mr. Glover is anxious to have a hearing and resolve those charges, but \nhis attorney has adjourned his hearing at least four times without consulting with Mr. Glover. \nUnable to reach his attorney to address this issue, Mr. Glover wrote directly to the town court \njustice to ask him not to allow his attorney to adjourn his case again. \n88.  Mr. Glover is concerned that his attorney may have a conflict of interest because \nshe may have represented his daughter in a family court proceeding involving him. He has been \nunable to raise this issue with his attorney, however, because he carmot reach her. \n89.  As of the filing ofthis complaint, Mr. Glover has been incarcerated 148 days and \nhas had no direct contact with his attorney since June 21, 2007, more than four months ago. \n90.  The State of New York has not provided Mr. Glover with the representation to \nwhich he is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as he has not had sufficient opportunity \nto discuss his case with his attorney, to participate in building a defense to the charges against \nhim, or to make informed decisions about the progress and disposition of his case; has been \ndeprived of investigative assistance, motions practice and vigorous advocacy 111at may contribute \nto a favorable resolution of his case and/or an end to urmecessary incarceration; may have been \ndeprived to the right to appointment of counsel free of conflicts of interest; and does not \nunderstand where his case stands or the status of the charges against him.  Upon information and \nbelief, the State of New York will continue to fail to provide Mr. Glover with the legal \nrepresentation to which he is entitled as his case proceeds. \n23 \n\n91.  The representation provided to Mr. Glover is illustrative of the pattern of \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants in the Counties and results from the structural and \nsystemic failings that led the Kaye Commission to conclude that New York State is failing to \nmeet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, including the \nabsence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate funding of the current \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed public defense system. \nRichard Love, Jr. (Onondaga County) \n92.  Richard Love, Jr. was arrested on September 12, 2007, and charged with grand \nlarceny in the third degree and criminal possession of a forged instrument, both felonies.  Upon \ninformation and belief; Mr. Love faces sentencing as a repeat felony offender and could face a \nlife sentence on these charges. \n93.  Mr. Love was not represented by an attorney at his initial arraigrunent, at which \nhe was denied bail. \n94.  Mr. Love first saw his attorney days after his arraigmnent when he carne to the \njail for a few minutes so that Mr. Love could sign a form that the attorney needed so he could get \npaid.  Mr. Love next saw his attorney during a court appearance weeks later, in late September. \nMr. Love's attorney did not meet or speak with. Mr. Love before or after the appearance.  During \nthe proceeding, Mr. Love did not understand what was going on and was not even sure what \ncharges were being discussed. \n95.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Love's attorney has not conducted any \nindependent investigation into the facts surrounding Mr. Love's case or the existence of any \npossible defenses that might be available to him. \n24 \n\n96,  Mr, Love was eager to file a motion for bail so he could return to work, but his \nattorney did not file a bail reduction motion, Mr, Love remains incarcerated. \n97.  Mr, Love has attempted on numerous occasions to contact his attorney from jail \nbut his attorney's dedicated voicemail box is usually full and his office does not accept collect \ncalls from the jail. Mr, Love's family has also attempted to reach his attorney without success, \nMr. Love called the Onondaga County Assigned Counsel Program to seek its assistance in \ncontacting his attorney, but the Onondaga County Assigned Counsel Program informed him that \nit could not help him, \n98.  On October 5, 2007, Mr. Love wrote to the judge and asked to proceed pro se \nrather than continue to be represented by his current attorney, \n99.  On October 26,2007, Mr, Love appeared before a different judge.  Mr, Love's \nattorney once again did not prepare Mr, Love for this appearance or meet with him prior to \nentering the courtroom,  During this proceeding, the prosecutor presented a plea offer that Mr. \nLove had already rejected,  Because his attorney had failed to do so, Mr, Love began to negotiate \ndirectly with the judge and the prosecutor and to advocate for a reduction to misdemeanor \ncharges,  Mr. Love told the judge that he felt uncomfortable taking a plea because he had never \nmet with his attorney to discuss the facts of his case.  Upon hearing this, the judge agreed to \nassign a new attorney to Mr, Love. \n100.  Mr, Love is a veteran of the United States Navy.  He is married with two grown \nchildren and seven grandchildren,  Before he was arrested, Mr, Love held two jobs to support his \nfamily,  Because he has been incarcerated for nearly two months, he lost both of his jobs. . \n101.  The State of New York has not provided Mr. Love with the representation to \nwhich he is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as he has not been represented in all \n25 \n\ncritical proceedings; has not had sufficient opportunity to discuss his case with his attorney, to \nparticipate in building a defense the charges against him, or to make an informed decision about \nthe progress and disposition of his case; and has been deprived of investigative assistance, \nmotions practice and vigorous advocacy that may contribute to a favorable resolution of his \ncharges and/or an end to unnecessary incarceration.  Upon information and belief, the State of \nNew York will continue to fail to provide Mr. Love with the legal representation to which he is \nentitled as his case proceeds. \n102.  The representation provided to Mr. Love is illustrative of the pattern of \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants in the Counties and results from the structural and \nsystemic failings that led the Kaye Commission to conclude that New York State is failing to \nmeet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, including the \nabsence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate funding of the current \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed public defense system. \nJacqueline Winbrone (Onondaga) \n103.  Jacqueline Winbrone was arrested on September 12, 2007, and charged with \npossession of a loaded firearm in the second degree, a felony.  After being called to her home \nbecause of a domestic dispute, the police searched the Winbrone family's car and found the \nfirearm, which Mrs. Winbrone stated was not hers and must belong to her husband.  The \nmaximum sentence Mrs. Winbrone faces on these charges is 15 years imprisonment. \n104.  Prior to her arrest, Mrs. Winbrone was the sole caretaker for her seriously ill \nhusban<4 who relied on her to transport him to dialysis treatment several times a week.  Shortly \nafter Mrs. Winbrone was arreste<4 her husband passed away.  Mrs. Winbrone believes that her \n26 \n\nhusband died because he had no one to care for him and transport him to dialysis.  Because no \none was able to make rent payments while she was incarcerated, Mrs. Winbrone has been evicted \nfrom her home. \n105.  Mrs. Winbrone was represented at arraignment but was assigned to a different \nattorney during the arraignment.  Bail was set at $10,000, which she could not afford. \n106.  After arraignment, Mrs. Winbrone wished to seek a bail reduction so she could \ntake care of her family.  She attempted to contact her attorney but his dedicated voicemail box \nwas consistently full and his office would not accept collect calls from the jail. \n107.  On September 16, 2007, Mrs. Winbrone learned that her husband had died. \nBecause the jail permitted her to make a non-collect call, Mrs. Winbrone was able to reach her \nattorney in his office for the first time and ask him to petition for a bail reduction so she could \nleave jail and attend the funeral.  Her attorney nevertheless failed to obtain a bail reduction \nhearing until a few days later, after the funeral had already occurred.  At the bail reduction \nhearing, the court reduced bail to $5000, which Mrs. Winbrone, who is on public assistance, still \ncould not afford.  In open court, Mrs. Winbrone tried to explain to her attorney that this bail \nreduction would not make any difference, but he did not respond.  At the end of the hearing, Mrs. \nWinbrone asked her attorney if they could meet, but he left without speaking to her. \n108.  On September 17, 2007, without consulting with Mrs. Winbrone or explaining the \nreasons, Mrs. Winbrone's attomey waived her right to a preliminary hearing. \n109.  Thereafter, Mrs. Winbrone tried several times to reach her attorney by phone \nwithout success.  She wrote to him, asked her mother to call him long-distance from Georgia, \nand called a prisoner-rights organization to ask it to reach out to him, again without success. \n27 \n\nUnable to reach her attorney, Mrs. Winbrone wrote a letter to the judge in her case explaining the \nfacts of her case, hoping the judge would help her get out ofj ail. \n110.  Mrs. Winbrone next saw her attorney several weeks later at a court appearance on \nNovember 1,2007, which she believes was scheduled because of the letter she wrote to the \njudge.  During this appearance, her attorney did not speak to her at all.  She did not understand \nwhat was happening during this proceeding.  When she heard her attorney misstating certain \nfacts of her case to the judge, she tried to correct him, but was told that her attorney must speak \n. on her behalf in court. \n111.  Upon information and belief, Mrs. Winbrone's attorney has not conducted any \nindependent investigation into the facts surrounding Mrs. Winbrone's case or the existence of \nany possible defenses that might have been available to her. \n112.  On November 2,2007, Mrs. Winbrone appeared before the court and was \nreleased on her own recognizance after spending almost two months in jail.  Mrs. Winbrone \nbelieves that her release is a result of a meeting she had with advocates from an Onondaga \nCounty pretrial release program, not the result of any advocacy by her attorney. \n113.  The State of New York has not provided Mrs. Winbrone with the representation \nto which she is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as she has not had sufficient \nopportunity to discuss her case with her attorney, to participate in building a defense to the \ncharge against her, or to make informed decisions about the progress and disposition of her \ncharge; has been deprived of investigative assistance, motions practice and vigorous advocacu \nthat may have contributed to a favorable disposition of her charge and/or and end to UI1I1ecessary \nincarceration; and was subjected to several weeks of UI1I1ecessary incarceration.  Upon \n28 \n\ninformation and belief, the State of New York will continue to fail to provide Mrs. Winbrone \nwith the legal representation to which she is entitled as her case proceeds. \n114.  The representation provided to Mrs. Winbrone is illustrative of the pattern of \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants in the Counties and is results from the structural \nand systemic failings that led the Kaye Commission to conclude that New York State is failing to \nmeet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, including the \nabsence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate funding of the current \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed public defense system. \nLane Loyzelle (Ontario County) \n115.  Lane Loyzelle was arrested on September 27,2007 and charged with petit \nlarceny, a misdemeanor, for allegedly stealing twenty dollars from two people he knew.  He \nfaces a maximum sentence of one year imprisonment, as well as fines of up to $1000. \n116.  At his arraignment, Mr. Loyzelle was not provided with an attomey.  Bail was set \nat $2500 cash or $5000 bond, which he could not afford.  Mr. Loyzelle asked the judge to lower \nthe bail so that he could return to work and not lose his job.  His request was denied and he was \nremanded to the Ontario County Jail.  Mr. Loyzelle has now lost his job. \n117.  Mr. Loyzelle has met with his attorney only once.  This meeting took place \nimmediately before a court appearance on October 10, 2007, lasted approximately five minutes, \nand took place in the holding area outside the courtroom, in full hearing of other inmates.  Mr. \nLoyzelle was uncomfortable discussing his case in front of other inmates, but Mr. Loyzelle's \nattorney never met with him other than in this public space. \n29 \n\n118.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Loyzelle's attorney never conducted any \nindependent investigation into the facts surrounding Mr. Loyzelle's case or the existence of any \nvalid defenses that might have been available. \n119.  As of the filing of the complaint, Mr. Loyzelle has been incarcerated for six \nweeks for allegedly stealing $20 and has not had any contact with his attorney for almost a \nmonth. \n120.  The State of New York has not provided Mr. Loyzelle with the representation to \nwhich he is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as he has not been provided with \nrepresentation at every critical stage; has not had sufficient opportunity to discuss his case with \nhis attomey, to participate in the building of a defense against the charges he faces, or to make \ninformed decisions about the progress and disposition of his case; and has been denied \ninvestigative assistance, motions practice and vigorous advocacy that may contribute to a \nfavorable resolution of his case.  Upon information and belief, the State of New York will \ncontinue to fail to provide Mr. LoyzeUe with the legal representation to which he is entitled as \nhis case proceeds. \n121.  The representation provided to Mr. Loyzelle is illustrative of the pattern of \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants in the Counties and results from the structural and \nsystemic failings that led the Kaye Commission to conclude that New York State is failing to \nmeet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, including the \nabsence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate fimding of the current \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed public defense system. \nTosha Steele (Ontario County) \n30 \n\n122.  Tosha Steele was arrested on July 25, 2007, and charged with criminal possession \nof a controlled substance in the third degree, a felony.  Ms. Steele, who has three children, faces \na maximum of25 years in prison and fines of up to $30,000. \n123.  Ms. Steele's attomey has never visited her in jail.  She has only seen her attomey \ntwice since her arrest in July, both times during or immediately prior to court appearances and \nhas spoken briefly on the phone with him once when she was able to reach him from the jail. \n124.  Ms. Steele first met her attorney immediately before a court appearance for \napproximately five to ten minutes in the holding area outside the courtroom, in full hearing of \nother inmates. \n125.  Ms. Steele did not see her attorney again until her next court appearance almost a \nmonth later, on August 20, 2007.  Without meeting with or consulting Ms. Steele beforehand, \nMs. Steele's attorney waived her right to a preliminary hearing.  Ms. Steele was confused about \nwhat had occurred but her attorney never explained it to her. \n126.  Ms. Steele's attomey failed to appear in court for her most recent court \nappearance on October 5,2007, and her case was adjourned, prolonging her pre-trial \nincarceration.  Ms. Steele's attorney has not contacted her to explain his failure to appear in court \nor to notify her of her next court date. \n127.  Upon information and belief, Ms. Steele's attomey has not conducted any \nindependent investigation into the facts surrounding Ms. Steele's case or any possible defenses \nthat may be available to her. \n128.  As of the filing of this complaint, Ms. Steele has been incarcerated for more than \nthree months and has not had any contact with her attomey for more than two months. \n31 \n\n129.  The State of New York has failed to provide Ms. Steele with the representation to \nwhich she is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as she has not had sufficient \nopportunity to discuss her case with her attorney, to participate in building a defense to the \ncharges against her, or to make informed decisions about the progress and disposition of her \ncase; has been subjected to lengthy and unnecessary pretrial incarceration; has been deprived of \ninvestigative services, motions practice and vigorous advocacy that could contribute to her \ndefense and/or bring an end to unnecessary incarceration; and does not understand where her \ncase stands or the status of the charges against her.  Upon information and belief, the State of \nNew York will continue to fail to provide Ms. Steele with the legal representation to which she is \nentitled as her case proceeds. \n130.  The representation provided to Ms. Steele is illustrative of the pattern of \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants in the Counties and results from the structural and \nsystemic failings that led the Kaye Commission to conclude that New York State is failing to \nmeet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, including the \nabsence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate funding of the current \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed public defense system. \nBruce Washington (Ontario County) \n131.  Bruce Washington was arrested on August 20, 2007, and charged with petit \nlarceny, a misdemeanor.  He faces a maximmn sentence of one year imprisonment, as well as \nfines of up to $1000. \n132.  At arraignment, Mr. Washington was not represented by counsel.  Bail was set at \n$1500 cash or $3000 bond, which he could not afford, and he was remanded to jail. \n32 \n\n133.  Mr. Washington's first meeting with his attorney occurred several days after his \narrest at the Ontario County Jail and lasted less than ten minutes.  Outside of this first meeting, \nMr. Washington has never met with his attorney in the jail.  All other contact has occurred solely \nbefore or after scheduled court appearances and has lasted no more than a few minutes. \n134.  Mr. Washington's attorney is a specialist in real estate and tax law, not criminal \ndefense. \n135.  Upon infonnation and belief, Mr. Washington's attorney never conducted any \nindependent investigation into the facts surrounding Mr. Washington's case or the existence of \nallY valid defenses that might have been available. \n136.  After remaining in jail for almost two months unable to discuss a possible defense \nwith his attorney, Mr. Washington pled guilty as charged on October 16, 2007.  At the time of \nhis plea, Mr. Washington was not infonned of the full consequences of his guilty plea.  For \nexample, after his plea had been entered, Mr. Washington learned that the lengthy pre-sentencing \ninvestigation required in his case would result in his being incarcerated for approximately three \nweeks longer than the sentence contemplated by his plea agreement.  Mr. Washington's attorney \nhas not met with Mr. Washington since entering the guilty plea and, upon information and belief, \nhas not taken any action to address the delay in sentencing.  Mr . Washington's sentencing \nhearing is scheduled for January 8, 2008. \n137.  The State of New York has not provided Mr. Washington with the representation \nto which he is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as he has not been represented at \nevery critical stage of the proceedings; has not had sufficient opportunity to discuss his case with \nhis attorney, to participate in building a defense to the charges against him, or to make informed \ndecisions about the progress and disposition of his case; was deprived of investigative assistance, \n33 \n\nmotions practice and vigorous advocacy that may have contributed to his defense; and has been \nsubjected to lengthy and unnecessary pretrial incarceration.  Upon information and belief, the \nState of New York will continue to fail to provide Mr. Washington with the legal representation \nto which he is entitled as his case proceeds. \n138.  The representation provided to Mr. Washington is illustrative of the pattern of \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants in the Counties and is results from the structural \nand systemic failings that led the Kaye Commission to conclude that New York State is failing to \nmeet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, including the \nabsence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate funding of the current \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed public defense system. \nShawn Chase (Schuyler County) \n139.  Shawn Chase was arrested on April 6, 2007, and charged with driving while \nintoxicated and driving with a blood alcohol level over 0.08%, both misdemeanors, and \npossession of an open container of alcohol in a motor vehicle, a traffic infraction.  Mr. Chase \nfaces a maximum of one year of imprisonment plus fines on these charges. \n140.  Mr. Chase's case was delayed five months before he was deemed eligible for a \npublic defense attorney.  After repeated denials of his application for representation by the \nSchuyler County Public Defender's Office, he was finally assigned counsel by a judge. \n141.  Mr. Chase submitted his first application for public defense services shortly after \nhis first court appearance, in late April or early May 2007.  When he applied, he was incorrectly \ntold that he would have a hard time obtaining an attorney because his charges were mere traffic \nviolations.  The public defender's office later denied his application based on his household \n34 \n\nincome and unspecified county guidelines, despite the fact that Mr. Chase has previously been \nfound eligible for public defense services in a neighboring county. \n142.  Once a month between May and October of 2007, Mr. Chase appeared in court \nand was told his case must be adjourned so that he could obtain counsel.  During this time, Mr. \nChase applied for a public defender approximately three additional times.  Upon information and \nbelief, his application was denied each time also on the basis of his household income and \nunspecified county guidelines. \n143.  At a court appearance in August of 2007, Mr. Chase, frustrated with his inability \nto obtain an attomey, provided the court, the prosecutor, and the assistant pubic defender with a \nletter prepared by a retired lawyer explaining why Mr. Chase was entitled to a public defender. \nAt his next court appearance, in September of2007, the judge ordered the Schuyler County \nPublic Defender's office to represent Mr. Chase.  During this court appearance, four months after \nhis arrest, Mr. Chase finally met with his attomey for the first time. \n144.  At Mr. Chase's trial, on October 30, 2007, Mr. Chase discovered only ten minutes \nbefore he took the stand that he would be testifying.  He was not prepared for his testimony.  Mr. \nChase was convicted of driving while intoxicated.  Mr. Chase erroneously believes that this \nconviction will bar him from obtaining a commercial license for his planned career as a civil \nengineer.  His attomey has not met with him since his conviction. \n145.  Mr. Chase's sentencing hearing is scheduled for December 19, 2007.  Mr. Chase \nis not sure what sentence he could face and how that sentence could impact his future plans. \n146.  The State of New York has failed to provide Mr. Chase with the representation to \nwhich he is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as he experienced urmecessary and \nprolonged delay in the appointment of counsel based on incoherent and excessively restrictive \n35 \n\neligibility standards; did not have sufficient opportunity to make informed decisions about the \nprogress and disposition of his case; and was denied effective representation at trial.  Upon \ninformation and belief, the State of New York will continue to fail to provide Mr. Chase with the \nlegal representation to which he is entitled as his case proceeds. \n147.  The representation provided to Mr. Chase is illustrative of the pattern of \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants in the Counties and results from the structural and \nsystemic failings that led the Kaye Commission to conclude that New York State is failing to \nmeet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, including the \nabsence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate funding of the current \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed public defense system. \nJemar Johnson (Schuyler County) \n148.  Jemar Johnson was arrested on August 30, 2007, and charged with criminal \npossession of a controlled substance in the third degree, a felony.  Ms. Johnson faces a maximum \nsentence of nine years imprisonment if convicted. \n149.  Ms. Johnson was not represented at arraignment, where bail was set at $15,000 \ncash or $30,000 bond.  Unable to pay this amount, she was remanded to jail. \n150.  On September 10,2007, Ms. Johnson's case was scheduled for a hearing, but Ms. \nJohnson was not taken to court and did not hear from her attorney to explain why she did not \nappear in court.  The next day she found out from a corrections officer that her bail had been \nreduced to $10,000 cash or $20,000 bond.  Still unable to pay, she remained injail. \n36 \n\n151.  Ms. Johnson has met her attomey only once, shortly after her arraignment.  She is \nunable to call her attomey because his office does not accept collect calls from the jail.  She \nwrote to him at least three times before he came to visit her again, at the end of September. \n152.  Upon information and belief, Ms. Johnson's attorney has conducted no \nindependent investigation into the charges Ms. Johnson faces, including contacting any of the \nwitnesses who could assist her defense. \n153.  Ms. Johnson received a plea offer from the district attorney but she cannot make \nan informed decision about whether to accept the plea because she does not understand the full, \ncollateral consequence of such a conviction, including the possible impact on her public \nassistance.  Ms. Johnson has lost confidence that her attorney will provide her with good advice \nabout whether to accept a plea or proceed to trial, and does not trust that her attorney is capable \nof mounting a defense for her at trial. \n154.  As of the filing of the complaint, Ms. Johnson has been incarcerated for more than \ntwo months.  Although biologically male, Ms. Johnson identifies as a female and is \nuncomfortable being housed in with other men in the Schuyler County Jail.  Her prolonged \nincarceration is harming her ability to obtain her General Educational Development certificate, \nwhich she was working for prior to her arrest.  Although Ms. Johnson is ready to take the GED \ntest, no one will come from Albany to administer the test to her because she is the only one in the \nSchuyler County Jail who is ready to take it. \n155.  The State of New York has failed to provide Ms. Johnson with the representation \nto which she is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as she has not been represented in all \ncritical proceedings; has not had sufficient opportunity to discuss her case with her attorney, to \nparticipate in building a defense to the charge against her, or to make informed decision about \n37 \n\nthe progress and disposition of her case; has been denied access to investigative services, \nmotions practice and vigorous advocacy that could contribute to her defense; and has been \nsubjected to prolonged and unnecessary incarceration. Upon information and belief, the State of \nNew York will continue to fail to provide Ms. Johnson with the legal representation to which she \nis entitled as her case proceeds. \n156.  The representation provided to Ms. Johnson is illustrative of the pattern of \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants in the Counties and results from the structural and \nsystemic failings that led the Kaye Commission to conclude that New York State is failing to \nmeet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, including the \nabsence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate funding of the current \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed public defense system. \nRobert Tomberelli (Schuyler County)· \n157.  Robert Tomberelli was arrested on June 15, 2007, and charged with driving while \nunder the influence of alcohol, a misdemeanor; aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor \nvehicle in the first degree, a felony; and two traffic infractions for having no headlights and \nparking in an intersection.  Mr. Tomberelli faces a maximum sentence of 4 years imprisoument. \n158.  At his arraigunlent on June 15,2007, Mr. Tomberelli was not represented by \ncounsel and he was released on his own recognizance. \n159.  Mr. Tomberelli has been represented by two different attorneys in his case \nbecause his case was originally in town court, which is covered by the one attorney, and was \nlater transferred to county court, which is covered by a different attorney. \n38 \n\n160.  On July 26, 2007, Mr. Tomberelli met with his second attorney.  During this \nmeeting, his attorney called the prosecutor's office and, despite the fact that she had not yet \ndiscussed the issue with Mr. Tomberelli, informed the prosecutor that Mr. Tomberelli would \nwaive his right to an indictment before a grand jury. \n161.  On October 4, 2007, Mr. Tomberelli waived his right to grand jury indictment and \nentered guilty pleas to the offenses of driving while under the influence of alcohol and \naggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle.  The guilty plea would subject him to the \njurisdiction of Schuyler County's specialty drug court.  Mr. Tomberelli is unsure whether his \nguilty plea means he will face prison time, what it means that his plea subjects him to the \njurisdiction of the drug court, or what the possible collateral consequences of his guilty plea \nmight be.  Mr. Tomberelli felt pressured to plead because he was given only a short amount of \ntime to accept or reject the plea, and he did not understand whether he had any other options, \nsuch as going to trial or negotiating a better plea. \n162.  Mr. Tomberelli's sentencing is scheduled for November 15, 2007.  Although he \nhas expressed concern about tenns of probation that would confine him to Schuyler County \nbecause his job is in another county, upon information and belief, his attorney has not raised this \nissue with a probation officer or the district attorney. \n163.  The State of New York has failed to provide Mr. Tomberelli with the \nrepresentation to which he is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as he was not \nrepresented in all critical stages; was deprived of consistent, vertical representation; and has not \nhad sufficient opportunity to discuss his case with his attorney, to participate in building a \ndefense to the charges against him, or make informed decisions about the progress and \ndisposition of his case.  Upon information and belief, the State of New York will continue to fail \n39 \n\nto provide Mr. Tomberelli with the legal representation to which he is entitled as his case \nproceeds. \n164.  The representation provided to Mr. Tomberelli is illustrative of the pattern of \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants in the COlU1ties and results from the structural and \nsystemic failings that led the Kaye Commission to conclude that New York State is failing to \nmeet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, including the \nabsence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate flU1ding of the current \ncOlU1ty-operated and largely cOlU1ty-financed public defense system. \nChristopher Yaw (Schuyler County) \n165.  Christopher Yaw was arrested on JlU1e 25,2007, for the felony crime of grand \nlarceny in the fourth degree.  He was arraigned without cOlU1sel in Dix Town Court, where bail \nwas set at $5000 cash or $10,000 bond.  Unable to pay this amolU1t, he was remanded to the \nSchuyler County Jail.  He was later transferred to the ChemlU1g County Jail, where he remains. \nMr. Yaw faces a maximum sentence of 4 years imprisonment on this charge. \n166.  Although Mr. Yaw agreed to waive both his right to a preliminary hearing and his \nright to a grand jury indictment, he did not fully understand the consequences of these waivers at \nthe time. \n167.  In September, 2007, Mr. Yaw wrote two letters to his attorney but received no \nresponse.  Subsequently, his attorney said she would visit him on October 19,2007, but she did \nnot do so.  In late October, Mr. Yaw learned that his November 1,2007, court appearance had \nbeen adjourned.  His attorney has provided no explanation for the adjourmnent. \n40 \n\n168.  On September 20,2007, Mr. Yaw was arraigned in Orange Town Court on \nmisdemeanor charges and traffic infractions related to his felony charge.  Because these charges \nare filed in a different court and the Schuyler County Public Defender's office assigns different \nattorneys to each court, Mr. Yaw is represented by a different attorney on these charges even \nthough they arise out of the same alleged incident as his felony charge. \n169.  Mr. Yaw understands only through his own research that one of the offers being \nconsidered by the district attorney for his felony charge is equivalent to a sentence he could get if \nhe went to trial on that charge.  Although he wishes to take his cases to trial, he has not had the \nopportunity to talk to his attorneys about the charges against him, the facts of his case, or \nwhether it would be possible to negotiate a better plea. \n170.  Upon infornlation and belief, Mr. Yaw's attorneys have conducted no \nindependent investigation into the facts surrounding Mr. Yaw's case or the existence of any valid \ndefenses that might have been available to him. \n171.  The State of New York has not provided Mr. Yaw with the representation to \nwhich he is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as he was not represented at all critical \nstages; was deprived of consistent, vertical representation; has not had sufficient opportunity to \ndiscuss his case with his attorney, to participate in building a defense to the charges against him, \nor to make informed decisions about the progress and disposition of his case; and has been \ndeprived of investigative assistance, motions practice and vigorous advocacy that may contribute \nto a favorable resolution of his charges andlor an end to Uffi1ecessary incarceration.  Upon \ninformation and belief, the State of New York will continue to fail to provide Mr. Yaw with the \nlegal representation to which he is entitled as his case proceeds. \n41 \n\n172.  The representation provided to Mr. Yaw is illustrative of the pattern of \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants in the Counties and results from the structural and \nsystemic failings that led the Kaye Commission to conclude that New York State is failing to \nmeet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, including the \nabsence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate funding of the current \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed public defense system. \nLuther Woodrow ofB  ooker, Jr. (Suffolk County) \n173.  Luther Woodrow of Booker, Jr. was arrested on September 28,2007 and charged \nwith criminal possession of stolen property in the fourth degree, a class E felony.  He faces a \nmaximum sentence of four years of imprisonment, as well as fines of up to $5000. \n174.  Mr. Booker was arraigned on September 29,2007, at the Suffolk County District \nCourt in Central Islip.  Bail was set at $1000 bond, which Mr. Booker could not afford, causing \nhim to remain in jail.  Mr. Booker's attorney did not advocate for lower baiJ. \n175.  At his next court appearance, on October 2,2007, Mr. Booker was represented by \na different Legal Aid attorney.  Mr. Booker met with this second attorney for five minutes \nimmediately before his scheduled court appearance.  This meeting took place in the inmate \nholding area, in full hearing of correctional officers and other inmates.  Although Mr. Booker \nstill sought a reduction in bail to enable him to return to his job and family, his second attorney, \nlike the first, did not file a bail reduction motion. \n176.  Mr. Booker had no other contact with his second attorney until his October 16, \n2007, court appearance.  Prior to that appearance, Mr. Booker again met with his second attorney \nfor less than five minutes in the holding area. \n42 \n\n177.  During the court appearance on October 16, Mr. Booker's second attorney waived \nhis right to file a motion under CPL § 180.8D without having discussed the issue with him or \nreceived his consent.  Mr. Booker signed the waiver in open court without being told what he \nwas signing or the consequences of such a waiver.  At the time of signing, Mr. Booker did not \nknow what type of document he was signing and felt confused and pressured to sign it. \n178.  After waiving his right to release, Mr. Booker's second attorney informed him, in \nopen court, that the best Mr. Booker could hope for would be the prosecutor's offer of eight \nmonths ofj ail time.  Mr. Booker felt he had no alternative but to enter a guilty plea and, in open \ncourt, agreed to do so.  The judge then questioned Mr. Booker and, when Mr. Booker \npersistently maintained his innocence despite having just entered a guilty plea, withdrew and \nvoided the plea.  Mr. Booker's second attorney told him that she would meet with him in the \nholding area after the proceeding to discuss what had happened with respect to his voided guilty \nplea. Mr. Booker waited but she never returned. \n179.  When Mr. Booker subsequently attempted to reach his second attorney from the \njail, the Legal Aid office informed him that he was being assigned a new, third attorney.  Mr. \nBooker asked if he could speak with this new attorney but was told that Legal Aid was yet not \nsure who the new attorney would be. \n180.  Still having no idea who his new attorney was, Mr. Booker appeared in court for a \nscheduled appearance on October 22,2007.  Mr. Booker's case was adjourned because no Legal \nAid attorney appeared in court that day to represent him, and he returned to jail. \n181.  The next day, Mr. Booker was brought to court again and met his third attorney \nfor minutes before his scheduled court appearance.  Like his other attorney meetings, this one \ntook place in the holding area, in full hearing of correctional officers and other imnates, and \n43 \n\nlasted only a few minutes.  In court that day, presented with no other options and without \nunderstanding the full, collateral consequences of his plea, Mr. Booker accepted the same plea \noffer he had rejected at his prior court appearance and entered a plea of guilty. \n182.  Upon information and belief, none of Mr. Booker's attorneys conducted any \nindependent investigation into the facts surrounding Mr. Booker's case or the existence of any \nvalid defenses that might have been available. \n183.  Mr. Booker is scheduled to be sentenced on Novernber 20, 2007 .. Mr. Booker has \nnot had any contact with any of his attorneys since he entered his gUilty plea on October 23, \n2007, and no attorney has contacted him to prepare him for sentencing. \n184.  Because he has been incarcerated for almost two months awaiting resolution of \nhis charges, Mr. Booker has not been able to provide necessary financial and emotional support \nto his pregnant live-in girlfriend and her six young children. \n185.  The State of New York has failed to provide Mr. Booker with the representation \nto which he is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as he has been deprived of consistent, \nvertical representation; and has not had sufficient opportunity to discuss his case with his \nattorneys, to participate in building a defense to the charges against him, or to malce informed \ndecisions about the progress and disposition of his case.  Upon information and belief, the State \nof New York will continue to fail to provide Mr. Booker with the legal representation to which \nhe is entitled as his case proceeds. \n186.  The representation provided to Mr. Booker is illustrative of the pattern of \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants in the Counties and results from tlle structural and \nsystenuc failings that led the Kaye Commission to conclude that New York State is failing to \nmeet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, including the \n44 \n\nabsence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate funding of the current \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed public defense system. \nEdward Kaminski (Suffolk County) \n187.  Edward Kaminski was arrested on December J 1,2006, and charged with grand \nlarceny in the fourth degree, a felony.  The maximum sentence that he faces is four years \nimprisonment and fines of up to $5000. \n188.  Mr. Kaminski was assigned a Legal Aid attorney on March 20,2007, after he ran \nout of funds to pay for his private attorney.  Mr. Kaminski's first contact with his Legal Aid \nattorney was for less than five minutes in the public hallway outside the court room before an \nappearance. \n189.  Following this brief meeting, Mr. Kaminski never saw, spoke with, or \ncommunicated with his attorney except during scheduled court appearances or in the public \nhallway outside the courtroom for less than five minutes prior to court appearances. \n190.  At a court appearance on May 15, 2007, Mr. Kaminski was informed that he \nwould be assigned to a different Legal Aid attorney.  Neither the court nor his new attorney \noffered any explanation for the reassignment. \n191.  On September 19, 2007, Mr. Kaminski was assigned to a third Legal Aid \nattorney.  Mr. Kaminski was dismayed because he felt he had developed a relationship with his \nsecond attorney and had been satisfied with and confident in that attorney's representation.  Once \nagain, no explanation for the reassignment was offered.  As with both of his previous attorneys, \nMr. Kaminski only met with his third attorney for less than five minutes outside the court room \nin the public hallway, in front of other defendants, immediately prior to his court appearance. \n45 \n\nUpon infonnation and belief, Mr. Kaminski's new attorney had not had time to review Mr. \nKaminski's case file and familiarize himself with the status of his case.  At the appearance,Mr. \nKaminski's attorney requested an adjournment. \n192.  Mr. Kaminski missed his October 15, 2007, court date.  Shortly afterward, Mr. \nKaminski's first attorney - not his present attorney - wrote him a letter infonning him that a \nbench wan-ant had been issued due to Mr. Kaminski's non-appearance. \n193.  At his next court date, on October 30, 2007, Mr. Kaminski approached both his \nfirst and his third Legal Aid attorneys in the hope of clearing up his confusion about who was \nrepresenting him.  Mr. Kaminski was not alone in his confusion, as his third Legal Aid attorney \nconfessed that he did not know who Mr. Kaminski's attorney was at the time and stated that the \nLegal Aid office is in \"chaos.\" \n194.  At that court appearance, on October 30, the judge presented Mr. Kaminski with a \npre-trial order stating that, due to his non-cooperation with the Legal Aid Society, his right to \ncourt-appointed counsel had been waived.  Mr. Kaminski believes that the large number of \nadjournments on his case due to the constant changing of Legal Aid attorneys gave the court the \nmisperception that he was not cooperating with them.  However, upon information and belief, his \nattorneys sought adjoumments most often to compensate for their lack of preparation.  Mr. \nKaminski is cUn'ently without a lawyer.  His trial is scheduled for November 29, 2007. \n195.  The stress cansed by the confusion and prolonged adjudication of his case has \naffected Mr. Kaminski's health.  He has lost fifteen pounds since he was charged and often has \ntrouble sleeping at night. Mr. Kaminski has missed necessary medical appointments to treat his \nneuropathy and Hepatitis C because the dates often conflict with required court appearances. He \nhas also been unable to visit and care for his elderly mother who suffers from dementia. \n46 \n\n196.  The State of New York has failed to provide Mr. Kaminski with the \nrepresentation to which he is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as he has been wrongly \ndenied his right to counsel; has been deprived of the ability to develop a meaningful attorney \nclient relationship and to have representation at every critical stage due to lack of consistent \nrepresentation; and does not understand where his case stands or what work has been done on it \nwhile on the verge of going to trial as a pro se litigant. Upon infonnation and belief, the State of \nNew York will continue to fail to provide Mr. Kaminski with the legal representation to which \nhe is entitled as his case proceeds. \n197.  The representation provided to Mr. Kaminski is illustrative of the pattern of \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants in the Counties and results from the structural and \nsystemic failings that led the Kaye Commission to conclude that New York State is failing to \nmeet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, including the \nabsence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate funding of the current \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed public defense system. \nJoy Metzler (Suffolk County) \n198.  Joy Metzler was arrested on October 16,2007, and charged with petit larceny, a \nmisdemeanor.  The maximnm sentence she faces is one year in jail, as well as fines up to $1000. \n199.  Ms. Metzler saw her attorney for the first time in open court during arraignment. \nBail was set at $1000 cash or $3000 bond, which Ms. Metzler could not afford, causing her to \nremain in jail for seven days until her brother was able to raise money and post bail.  Ms. \nMetzler's attorney took no action to advocate for lower bail and, as a result of her incarceration, \n47 \n\nshe lost her new job.  She is unsure how her family, including her brother and his three children \nwho depend on her income, will now get by. \n200.  At her next court appearance, on October 22, 2007, Ms. Metzler was represented \nby a second Legal Aid attorney.  This attorney met with Ms. Metzler for a few minutes prior to \nthe court appearance in the holding are!\\ in full hearing of correctional officers and other \ninrnates.  Since then, Ms. Metzler has not seen or heard from her attorney and remains unsure of \nthe status of her case. \n201.  Upon information and belief, neither of Ms. Metzler's attorneys conducted any \nindependent investigation into the facts surrounding Ms. Metzler's case or the existence of any \nvalid defenses that might have been available. \n202.  The State of New York has failed to provide Ms. Metzler with the legal \nrepresentation to which she is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as she has not been \nprovided with consistent, vertical representation; has not had sufficient opportunity to discuss her \n. case with her attorney, to participate in building a defense to the charges against her, or to make \ninformed decisions about the progress and disposition of her case; and was subjected to \nunnecessary incarceration.  Upon infonnation and belief, the State of New York will continue to \nfail to provide Ms. Metzler with the legal representation to which she is entitled as her case \nproceeds. \n203.  The representation provided to Ms. Metzler is illustrative of the pattern of \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants in the Counties and results from the structural and \nsystemic failings that led the Kaye Commission to conclude that New York State is failing to \nmeet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, including the \n48 \n\nabsence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate funding of the current \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed public defense system. \nVictor Turner (Suffolk County) \n204.  Victor Turner was arrested on August 18, 2007, and charged with criminal \npossession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree and resisting arrest, both \nmisdemeanors, and disorderly conduct, a violation.  Mr. Turner also faces another misdemeanor \npossession of a controlled substance charge from an earlier incident in 2006. The maximurn \nsentence Mr. Turner faces is six years imprisomnent, as well as fines of up to $7250. \n205.  Legal Aid began its representation of Mr. Turner on or around January of 2007, \nwhen he ran out offunds to pay the private attorney he has been able to retain on his 2006 \ncharge.  Since that time, Mr. Turner's case has been handled by at least four different Legal Aid \nattorneys.  During the first seven months of his representation by Legal Aid, he was represented \nby a different attorney at each court appearance.  His current attorney has been handling his case \nfor four months. \n206.  Mr. Turner's only meetings with his various attorneys have taken place at the \ncourthouse immediately before or during scheduled court appearances.  Each of these meetings \nlasted less than five minutes and took place in the hallway or other public areas of the courtroom, \nin full hearing of correctional officers and other defendants. \n207.  Mr. Turner has repeatedly refused to accept a plea offer urged on him by both the \nprosecutor and his own attorneys.  Each time, Mr. Turner's attorneys have responded to his \nrefusal by requesting an adjournment of his case, whereupon the prosecutor and Mr. Turner's \n49 \n\nnext attorney would simply present the same plea bargain to him again at the next court \nappearance. \n208.  Mr. Turner has never spoken with or seen any of his attorneys except in court. \nDuring the fIrst ten months of his representation by Legal Aid, he did not even have contact \ninformation for Legal Aid and was unable to ask questions or get updates about the status of his \ncase.  Mr. Turner eventually received a business card with his current attorney's contact \ninfonnation during his October 19, 2007, court appearance, ten months after he was assigned to \nbe represented by Legal Aid. \n209.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Turner's attorneys have conducted no \nindependent investigation of the facts underlying his charges or any possible defenses that may \nbe available to him.  Mr. Turner is concerned that witnesses who could support his defense may \ndisappear because the incident underlying his arrest occurred over one year ago. \n210.  The prolonging of Mr. Turner's case over the past year has made it diffIcult for \nhim to hold down a job because he must constantly request days off for court appearances.  As a \nresult, Mr. Turner is unable to meet his child-support obligations to his young daughter.  Mr. \nTurner also lost his car, making it even more diffIcult to hold down a job and make his monthly \n. court appearances. \n211.  Mr. Turner's next court appearances are scheduled for November 16, 2007, and \nNovember 30, 2007.  His attorneys have yet to explain the purpose of these appearances or \nprepare him for them. \n212.  The State of New York has failed to provide Mr. Turner with the representation to \nwhich he is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as he has not been provided with \nconsistent, vertical representation; has not had suffIcient opportunity to discuss his case with his \n50 \n\nattorneys, to participate in building a defense to the charges against him, or to make infonned \ndecisions about the progress and disposition of his case; has been deprived of appropriate \ninvestigative assistance, motions practice and vigorous advocacy that may have contributed to a \nfavorable resolution of the charges; and does not understand where his case stands or the status \nof the charges against him.  Upon infonnation and belief, the State of New York will continue to \nfail to provide Mr. Tumer with the legal representation to which he is entitled as his case \nproceeds. \n213.  The representation provided to Mr. Turner is illustrative of the pattern of \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants in the Counties and results from the structural and \nsystemic failings that led the Kaye Commission to conclude that New York State is failing to \nmeet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, including the \nabsence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate funding of the current \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed public defense system. \nCandace Brookins (Washington County) \n214.  Candace Brookins was arrested on October 15,2007, and charged with five \ncounts of forgery in the second degree, a felony, five counts of criminal possession of a forged \ninstrument in the second degree, also a felony, and one count of petit larceny, a misdemeanor. \nMs. Brookins faces a maximum sentence of twenty years in prison, as weI! as fines of up to \n$51,000. \n215.  Ms. Brookins has a four-year-old daughter whom Ms. Brookins's mother is taking \ncare of while Ms. Brookins is incarcerated.  lfMs. Brookins were sentenced to tlle statutory \n51 \n\nmaximum, she would not be released until her daughter was twenty-four, losing all opportunity \nto raise and parent her. \n216.  Ms. Brookins has only spoken to her attorney once over the phone and once \ninunediately prior to a court appearance on October 16, 2007, when her attorney spoke to her \nwhile a corrections officer was only feet away, with no apparent concern for confidentiality.  Ms. \nBrookins's attorney has not provided her with a copy of her court files or the investigative files \nfor her case. \n217.  Upon information and belief, Ms. Brookins's attorney has conducted no \nindependent investigation into the facts surrounding Ms. Brookins's case or the existence of any \npossible defenses that may be available to her \n218.  Ms. Brookins is currently represented by the same attorney who represented a \nwitness in Ms. Brookins's case when that witness was initially charged with the crime with \nwhich Ms. Brookins now stands accused, a clear conflict of interest.  The witness had been \ncharged with crimes derived from passing bad checks, but, represented by Ms. Brookins's \ncurrent attorney, defended herself by claiming that Ms. Brookins had in fact written the checks \nwithout her permission.  The charges against the witness were dropped, and charges were \nsubsequently filed against Ms. Brookins based on the witness's statements. \n219.  Ms. Brookins had a court hearing on October 30, 2007.  Upon information and \nbelief, her case was adjoumed pending indictment.  She remains incarcerated. \n220.  The State of New York has failed to provide Ms. Brookins with the representation \nto which she is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as she has not had sufficient \nopportunity to discuss her case with her attorney, to participate in building a defense to the \ncharges against her, or to make informed decisions about the progress and disposition of her \n52 \n\ncase; and has not been provided with an attorney who is free from conflicts concerning her case. \nUpon information and belief, the State of New York will continue to fail to provide Ms. \nBrookins with the legal representation to which she is entitled as her case proceeds. \n221.  The representation provided to Ms. Brookins is illustrative of the pattern of \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants in the Counties and results from the structural and \nsystemic failings that led the Kaye Commission to conclude that New York State is failing to \nmeet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, including the \nabsence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate funding of the current \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed public defense system. \nRandy Habshi (Washington County) \n222.  Randy Habshi was arrested on July 26, 2007, and charged with burglary in the \nsecond degree, a felony.  He faces a maximum sentence of fifteen years of imprisonment, as well \nas fines of up to $15,000. \n223.  At arraignment, Mr. Habshi was not represented by counsel.  Bail was set at \n$100,000 cash or $200,000 bond, which he could not afford. \n224.  Without any meaningful conversations with his attorney and without fully \nunderstanding the nature of the waiver, on August 1,2007, Mr. Habshi waived his preliminary \nexamination based on his attorney's instruction. \n225.  For over two months, between August and October, Mr. Habshi never saw or \nspoke with his attorney outside of court appearances, despite Mr. Habshi's repeated attempts to \ncontact his attorney.  At a court appearance on October 10,2007, Mr. Habshi's attorney did not \n53 \n\nshow up.  The next day, Mr. Habshi's attorney visited him in jail for a few minutes solely to \ndeliver the prosecutor's plea offer. \n226.  Mr. Habshi's official criminal record contains what he believes to be a mistake, \nbut his attorney has provided him no opportunity to discuss the mistake or the possibility of \nclearing it up.  This potential error, a plea to a misdemeanor that is currently recorded as a \nfelony, could make a substantial difference in sentencing if Mr. Habshi were to plead guilty or be \nfound guilty after trial.  The prosecutor's plea offer reflects the possibly mistaken premise that \nMr. Habshi has a previous felony conviction. \n227.  Mr. Habshi has taken advantage of his time in jail to break several addictious.  He \nhas completed a OED course and is awaiting the results of his examination .. Nevertheless, Mr. \nHabshi's attorney has failed to speak with him concerning any details of his life which might \nbecome relevant at sentencing, should Mr. Habshi plead guilty or be found guilty after trial. \n228.  The State of New York has failed to provide Mr. Habshi with the representation \nto which he is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as he had insufficient opportunity to \ndiscuss his case with his attorney, to participate in building a defense to the charges against him, \nand to make informed decisions about the progress and disposition of his case.  Mr. Habshi has \nalso been deprived of alternatives to incarceration that would offer him effective treatment for \nhis past drug addictions. Upon information and belief, the State of New York will continue to fail \nto provide Mr. Habshi with the legal representation to which he is entitled as his case proceeds. \n229.  The representation provided to Mr. Habshi is illustrative ofthe pattern of \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants in the Counties and results from the structural and \nsystemic failings that led the Kaye Commission to conclude that New York State is failing to \nmeet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, including the \n54 \n\nabsence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate funding of the current \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed public defense system. \nRonald McIntyre (Washington County) \n230.  Ronald McIntyre was arrested on October 24, 2005, and charged with grand \nlarceny in the fourth degree, a felony.  He faces a maximum sentence of seven years of \nimprisonment, as well as fines of up to $5,000. \n231.  On December 20, 2005, Mr. McIntyre notified the court that he had attempted to \ncontact his public defense attorney several times to ascertain the date of his next court hearing, \nbut the public defender had not returned his calls.  Mr. McIntyre's court file contains no \nindication that the court responded to his request for information concerning his next court date. \nBecause of his attorney's failure to inform him of his court date, Mr. McIntyre then missed his \ncourt date on January 17,2006. A bench warrant was issued for Mr. McIntyre's arrest, and he \nwas re-arrested and remanded to jail on August 14, 2007. \n232.  Mr. McIntyre Was assigned a new attorney following his re-arrest.  He spoke with \nthis attorney for only one or two minutes at two separate court appearances. \n233.  Mr. McIntyre has now been assigned a third attorney.  Mr. McIntyre has had no \ncontact with this third attorney and has not been able to discuss the strategic ramifications of \ntestifYing before the grand jury with any attorney. \n234.  As of the filing of this complaint, Mr. McIntyre has been incarcerated for nearly \nthree months and does not understand what is happening with his case or whether he has been \nindicted. \n55 \n\n235.  The State of New York has failed to provide Mr. McIntyre with the representation \nto which he is constitutionally and legally entitled, insofar as he has been denied consistent, \nvertical representation, hampering his attempts to explain his case to an attorney and his hopes of \nreceiving substantive representation; and has had insufficient opportunity to discuss his case with \nhis attorney, to participate in building a defense to those charges, or to make informed decisions \nabout the progress and disposition of his case.  Upon information and belief, the State of New \n. York will continue to fail to provide Mr. McIntyre with the legal representation to which he is \nentitled as his case proceeds. \n236.  The representation provided to Mr. McIntyre is illustrative ofthe pattern of \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants in the Counties and results from the structural and \nsystemic failings that led the Kaye Cormnission to conclude that New York State is failing to \nmeet its constitutional and legal obligations to indigent persons accused of crimes, including the \nabsence of statewide standards, meaningful oversight and adequate funding of the current \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed public defense system. \nThe Right to Counsel in New York State \n237.  The right to counsel is firmly established in New York State and has been since \nthe Legislature passed section 308 of the Criminal Procedure Law in 1881.  Indeed, the \nConstitution and laws of New York provide far more extensive protections in this area than \nfederal constitutional law provides.  See, e.g., People v. Settles, 46 N. Y.2d 154, 161 (1978) (\"So \nvalued is the right to counsel in this State ... it has developed independent of its Federal \ncounterpart....  Thus, we have extended the protections afforded by our State Constitution \nbeyond those of the Federal-well before certain Federal rights were recognized.\"); People v. \n56 \n\nArthur, 22 N.Y.2d 325, 328 (1968) (noting that the broad right to counsel in New York requires \nexclusion of confession taken after attorney request and was denied access to client, though \nfederal law may not); People v. Benevento, 91 N.Y.2d 708, 714 (1998) (rejecting the more \nrestrictive \"harmless error\" test applied to federal claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and \napplying a more flexible standard); People v. Krom, 61 N.Y.2d 187, 197 (1984) (explaining that, \nin contrast to federal law, the right to counsel in New York does not permit law enforcement to \nquestion a suspect after invocation ofrightto counsel even if the suspect initiates conversation). \n238.  In 1965, the Court of Appeals further expanded the right to counsel in People v. \nWitenski, which held that indigent defendants in all criminal cases, not merely in felony \nprosecutions, are entitled to have counsel appointed to represent them.  15 N.Y.2d 392, 395 \n(1965).  The Court of Appeals observed that the \"right and the duty of our courts, to assign \ncounsel for the defense of destitute persons, indicted for crime, has been, by long and uniform \npractice, as firmly incorporated into the law of the State, as if it were made iniperative by express \nenactment.\" ld at 397 (internal quotation omitted).  The Court also noted that in New York \nState \"the right of counsel must be made 'meaningful and effective' in criminal courts on every \nlevel.\" ld at 395. \n239.  That same year, the Court of Appeals held in People v. Hughes, that an indigent \ndefendant \"who is by statute accorded an absolute right to appeal ... is entitled to the assignment \nof counsel to represent him on such appeal if he so requests.\"  15 N. Y.2d 172 (1965).  It is \nequally well established that this right requires \"meaningful and effective\" assistance of assigned \nappellate counsel.  ld at 173. \n57 \n\n240.  Accordingly, under the Constitution and laws of New York, as well as the \nConstitution of the United States, the obligation to provide meaningful and effective assistance \nof counsel to indigent defendants in all criminal court proceedings rests with the State. \nThe State's Abdication of Responsibility for Public Defense Services to the Counties \n241.  In 1965, to meet constitutional mandates, the Legislature adopted Article 18·B   of \nthe New York County Law, requiring each of New York's 62 counties to establish its own plan \nfor providing indigent criminal defendants with legal representation.  Article 18·B offers \ncounties the option of creatiog a public defense system using one of three methods, or a \ncombination thereof: (1) establishing county public defender offices; (2) contracting with a \nprivate legal aid society; or (3) using a panel of private assigned counsel. \n242.  Onondaga County relies solely on an assigned counsel system to provide public \ndefense services to criminal defendants. The assigned counsel program is administered by the \nOnondaga County Bar Association under contract with the county government. \n243.  Ontario County also relies solely on an assigned counsel system, administered by \nthe Ontario County Bar Association, to provide public defense services to criminal defendants. \n244.  Schuyler County relies on a county public defender office 10 provide public \ndefense services to criminal defendants.  The Schuyler County public defender office consists of \na Chief Public Defender and one part-time assistant public defender.  The county maintains a \ncontract with a private attorney from an adjacent county to handle most cases in which the public \ndefender cannot represent the client due to a conflict of interest; any additional conflicts cases \nare distributed among a small number of assigned counsel. \n58 \n\n245.  Suffolk County contracts with a legal aid society to provide the majority of its \npublic defense services, with a smaller number of conflicts cases handled by assigned counsel. \nThe Suffolk County Legal Aid Society consists of approximately 60 full-time attorneys who staff \ntwo offices, one in the eastern part of the county and another in the western part. \n246.  Washington County relies on a county public defender office to provide public \ndefense services to criminal defendants.  The Washington County public defender office consists \nof one part-time Chief Public Defender and three additional part-time assistant public defenders. \nConflict cases are handled by assigned counsel. \nThe Lack ofE  nforceable, Statewide Standards \n247.  Unlike the vast majority of the rest of the country, New York State has \nestablished no enforceable standards for the provision of public defense services by which the \nquality of representation can be measured and guaranteed.  Thus, there is no mechanism for \nmeasuring whether constitutionally adequate counsel is being provided to indigent defendants \nand for insuring against disparities in the quality of representation by mere happenstance of \ngeographic location. \n248.  The American Bar Association (ABA), the National Legal Aid and Defender \nAssociation (NLADA), the National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and \nGoals (NAC), the New York State Defenders Association (NYSDA), and the New York State \nBar Association (NYSBA) have all promulgated standards reflecting a general consensus for \nmeasuring the quality of defense services.  See, e.g., ABA Standards for Criminal Justice: \nProviding Defense Services (3d ed. 1992); ABA Ten Principles of a Public Defense Delivery \nSystem (2002); ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Providing Defense Services (3d ed. 1992); \n59 \n\nNLADA Guidelines for Negotiating and Awarding Governmental Contracts for Criminal \nDefense Services (1984); NLADA, Standards for the Administration of Assigned Counsel \nSystems (1989); NAC Report of the Task Force on Courts (1973); NYSDA, Standards for \nProviding Constitutionally and Statutorily Mandated Representation in New York State (2004); \nNYSBA, Standards for Providing Mandated Representation (2005). \n249.  None of these standards are enforced by the State. \nThe Lack ofS tate Supervision and Oversight \n250.  Article 18-B delegates to the counties responsibility for providing meaningful and \neffective representation in criminal proceedings to people who cannot afford private lawyers. \nThe State exercises no meaningful supervision or oversight of the provision of public defense \nservices. \n251.  No state agency or office exists for the purpose of monitoring or evaluating the \nquality of representation provided under the counties' chosen plans for providing public defense. \n252.  Although the Office of the State Comptroller requires each county to submit an \nannual report in order to qualifY for state funding for public defense services, no state agency or \nofficer reviews these forms for the purpose of evaluating whether the counties' systems meet \nconstitutional standards for representation.  A county's system is only evaluated by the \nComptroller's office ifthe aunual report reflects a reduction in local expenditures from the \nprevious year, in which case the county may still qualifY for state funds if they demonstrate a \n\"maintenance of effort\" to provide public defense services. \n253.  Counties often provide inaccurate or incomplete information in their annual \nreports.  In past years, several counties have failed to complete any report at all. \nThe Lack ofA  dequate State Funds for Public Defense Services \n60 \n\n254.  Article 18-B places the financial burden on the counties to provide public defense \nservices.  The result, according to the Kaye Commission Report, is that \"[t]he amount of monies \ncurrently allocated within the State of New York for the provision of constitutionally-mandated \nindigent criminal defense is grossly inadequate.\" \n255.  In 2003, responding to a court ruling, the Legislature raised the rates of \ncompensation for private assigned counsel lawyers (known as 18-B lawyers) and created the \nIndigent Legal Services Fund (\"ILSF\") to provide, for the first time, some state funding to \ncompensate for the additional county expenditures required to cover the increase in 18-B rates. \n256.  Despite the creation of the ILSF, state funding remains a very small percentage of \nthe overall cost of public defense services in the counties and does not ensure adequate funding \nlevels.  In all but one county, state funds in 2006 accounted for one-quarter or less of the total \ncosts of providing public defense services.  In many counties, state funds constituted only 15% \nof overall public defense expenditures.  Across the state, state funds accounted for 18% of total \nspending on public defense, with counties bearing the burden for most of the remaining costs. \n257.  As the Kaye Commission notes, the State's failure to provide adequate funding \n\"imposes a large unfunded mandate by the state upon its counties [that] results in a very uneven \ndistribution of services and compromises the independence of defense providers.\" The Kaye \nCommission concludes that the funding system \"results in an inadequate and in many respects an \nunconstitutional level of representation and creates significant disparities in the quality of \nrepresentation based on no factor other than geography, thereby impugning the fairness of New \nYork's criminal justice system.\" \nThe Kaye Commission on the Future ofIndigent Defense's Indictment of New York's Public \nDefense System \n61 \n\n258.  A comprehensive indictment of New York's public defense system came in June \n2006, when the Kaye Commission on the Future of Indigent Defense released a report \nconcluding that \"the indigent defense system in New York State is both sev:erely dysfunctional \nand structurally incapable of providing each poor defendant with the effective legal \nrepresentation that he or she is guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States and the \nConstitution and laws of the State of New York .... [and] has resulted in a disparate, inequitable, \nand ineffective system for securing constitutional guarantees to those too poor to obtain counsel \nof their own choosing.\" \n259.  The Kaye Commission was convened in May 2004 by Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye \nand, according to Judge Kaye's State of the Judiciary Address earlier that year, was charged with \n\"exarnin[ing] the effectiveness of indigent criminal defense services across the State, and \nconsider[ing] alternative models of assigning, supervising and financing assigned counsel \ncompatible with New York's constitutional and fiscal realities.\"  Chaired by William E. \nHellerstein and the Honorable Burton B. Roberts, the Kaye Commission consisted of 30 \nmembers representing each of New York's twelve judicial districts and included prominent \nprosecutors, defense attorneys and judges. \n260.  The Kaye Commission conducted four public hearings (in N ew York City, \nAlbany, Rochester and Ithaca), with testimony from 93 individuals and groups from across the \nState, including public defenders, private defense lawyers, assigned connsel plan administrators, \njudges, prosecutors, experts in public defense, bar association representatives, members of the \ncivil rights community, representatives of community groups, and criminal defendants and their \nfamilies. \n62 \n\n261.  The Kaye Commission also drew extensively on the factual findings of its \nconsultant, The Spangenberg Group, which. according to the Kaye Commission, \"is a nationally \nand internationally recognized criminal justice research and consulting firm that specializes in \nresearch concerning indigent defense services.\" The Spangenberg Group collected and analyzed \ndata from each of New York's 62 counties and conducted independent site work in 22 counties \nspecifically selected to be geographically and demographically representative of the entire State. \nThe Spangenberg Group's findings were presented to the Kaye Commission in an April 5, 2006, \nreport entitled Status ofI ndigent Dejense in New York.  According to the Kaye Commission, the \nSpangenberg Group's report represents \"the most comprehensive study of indigent defense \nrepresentation ever undertaken in New York State.\" \n262.  Based on the facts llilCovered by the Spangenberg Group and on the hearings it \nconducted, the Kaye Commission concluded that \"New York's current fragmented system of \ncounty-operated and largely county-financed indigent defense services fails to satisfY the state's \nconstitutional and statutOlY obligations to protect the rights of the indigent accused.\" \n263.  The Kaye Commission's \"ultimate conclusion,\" based on all the information \npresented to it, was \"that the delivery system most likely to guarantee quality representation to \nthose entitled to it is a statewide defender system that is truly independent, is entirely and \nadequately state-funded, and is one in which those providing indigent defense services are \nemployees of entities within the defender system or are participants in an assigned counsel plan \nthat has been approved by the body established to administer the statewide defender system.\" \nFurther, the Commission noted that \"[a]dequate funding of indigent criminal defense must be \nprovided by the New York Legislature from the State's General Fund, not from the counties.\" \n63 \n\nNew York State's Long History of Violating the Right to Counsel for Indigent Defendants \n264.  The Kaye Commission report is only the latest in a long line of indictments of \nNew York's public defense system.  The State has never fully lived up to its obligation to \nprovide meaningful and effective assistance of counsel to all indigent defendants facing criminal \ncharges, though it has long known that its obligation was not being met.  There is a decades-long \nhistory of indictments levied against New York's fractured public defense system. \n265.  As far back as 1967, the New York State Bar Association conducted a seminar \naddressing the absence of standards for ensuring quality representation and the lack of guidelines \nfor determining eligibility, utilizing investigators and experts, and establishing the scope of \nrepresentation.  Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, the New York State Defenders \nAssociation published a series of reports and testified before numerous bodies decrying the crisis \nin public defense funding.  In 1994, the New York County Lawyers Association established a \ntask force to study the issue and, the following year, urged the immediate creation of a Board of \nTrustees for Indigent Defense to oversee and secure the professional independence of defender \norganizations in New York City. \n266.  In 1997, the New York County Lawyers' Association's Task Force on the \nRepresentation of the Indigent issued a report declaring that the rates of compensation for \nassigned counsel were inadequate and \"inconsistent with New York's commitment to equal \njustice.\" NYCLA, Task Force on the Representation oft he Indigent, Assigned Counsel \nCompensation Committee (1997). \n267.  In 2000, the Unified Court System issued a report, Assigned Counsel \nCompensation in New York: A GrOWing Crisis, Which focused on the problem created by low \nrates for assigned counsel.  The report concluded not only that rates should be increased, but also \n64 \n\nthat the State must share the cost of assigned counsel compensation, establish a statewide review \nprocess for reviewing rates, and implement statewide eligibility standards. \n268.  In March 2001, after holding extensive hearings, the Appellate Division, First \nDepartment's Committee on Legal Representation of the Poor issued a report entitled Crisis in \nthe Legal Representation oft he Poor: Recommendationsfor a Revised Plan to Implement \nMandated Funded Legal Representation ofP ersons Who Cannot Afford Counsel.  The report \nconcluded that \"[t]he entire system by which poor people are provided legal representation is in \ncrisis\" and that the major causes of the crisis included \"lack of resources, support and respect, \n[and] inadequate funding of institutional providers combined with ever-increasing caseloads.\" \nThe Committee called on the State \"to reconsider the entire legislative structure relating to \ngovernmentally funded legal representation of the poor.\" \n269.  Also in 2001, the New York State Defenders' Association issued a report, \nResolving the Assigned Counsel Fee Crisis: An Opportunity to Provide County Fiscal Reliefa  nd \nQuality Public Defense Services.  The report went beyond the call for raising assigned counsel \nrates and called for the creation of \"an independent and politically insulated statewide Public \nDefense Commission that would oversee both the distribution of state fimds and the provision of \ndefense services,\" as well as the creation of enforceable, statewide standards for both eligibility \ndeterminations and evaluating service providers. \n270.  In April 2001, the New York Times published a three-part series on New York \nCity's public defense system.  An April 12, 2001, editorial accompanying the series noted that its \ndescription of the system raised a real question of \"whether many defendants are getting the legal \nrepresentation to which they are entitled, or are receiving merely token representation to give \ntheir trials a veneer of constitutionality\" and called for \"a strong state role - preferably through a \n65 \n\npolitically insulated commission - in setting quality standards ... and in exercising vigorous \noversight to make sure those standards are met.\" \n271.  In July 2001, the Committee for an Independent Public Defense Commission, \nchaired by Michael S. Whiteman, former counsel to Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller, declared \nthat the indigent defense system was on the verge of collapse and presented a bill to establish an \nindependent oversight commission. \n272.  In 2003, New York County Lawyers' Association successfully sued the State of \nNew York, alleging that the compensation scheme for assigned counsel violated the state and \nfederal constitutional right to meaningful and effective counsel.  In his decision, Supreme Court \nJustice Lucindo Suarez made the following factual findings regarding the provision of public \ndefense services across the State: \nToo many assigned counsel do not: conduct a prompt and thorough \ninterview of the defendant; consult with the defendant on a regular basis; \nexamine the legal sufficiency of the complaint or indictment; seek the \ndefendant's prompt pre-trial release; retain investigators, social workers, \nor other experts where appropriate; file pretrial motions where \nappropriate; fully advise the defendant regarding any plea and only after \nconducting an investigation of the law and the facts; prepare for trial and \ncourt appearances; and engage in appropriate presentence advocacy, \nincluding seeking to obtain the defendant's entry into any appropriate \ndiversionary program. \nN.Y. County Lawyers Ass'n v. State, 196 Misc.2d 761, 774-75 (Sup. Ct. N.Y. County 2003). \n273.  In 2004, the inadequacies of New York's public defense system were noticed on a \nnational level in the American Bar Association's Report, Gideon's Broken Promise.  The report \nnoted that New York failed to meet national standards regarding training for public defense \nservice providers, unconstitutionally restricted eligibility standards because of fmandal pressures \nto keep costs low, and in some parts of the state had \"radically out of whack\" caseloads ranging \nfrom 1200 to 1600 cases per attorney. \n66 \n\n274.  Also in 2004, the NAACP Legal Defense & Education Fund released a report \nentitled The Status ofI ndigent Defense in Schuyler County concluding after four months of field \nwork that \"the quality of public defense services ... was extremely poor and fell short of state \nand federal constitutional, as well as professional standards for criminal defense.\" \n275.  In 2005, the New York State Bar Association's Special Committee to Ensure \nQuality of Mandated Representation released a report finding that public defense service \nproviders in New York \"are under-funded and overworked to such an extent that they lack the \ntime or resources necessary to maintain and improve the quality of the representation they \nprovide.\" The report concluded that addressing New York's public defense crisis required \"the \ncreation of an independent public defense oversight mechanism empowered to provide oversight, \nquality assurance, support and resources to providers of mandated representation.\" \n276.  As recently as August, 2007, ajoint report of the National Legal Aid and \nDefender Association and the New York State Defender's Association detailed the problems \nwith New York's public defense system as they impacted Franklin County.  The report \nconcluded that, \"[v]ictimized by an underfunded and fragmented system that violates national \nlegal standards and the state's professed commitment to equal justice, Franklin County fails to \nprovide effective representation on behalf of the accused in criminal cases .... [L]eaving the task \nof funding public defense services to the counties - even in part - endangers a state's entire \nability to dispense justice fairly.\" \n277.  In light of the Kaye Commission Report, the Spangenberg Group Report and the \nnumerous reports and studies that preceded them, it is clear that the State has known of the \ndeficiencies in the State's public defense system for many years.  The State's failure to remedy \n67 \n\nthose deficiencies amounts to deliberate indifference to the constitutional and legal rights of \nindigent criminal defendants. \nThe Statewide Failure to Meet Basic Standards of Constitutional Legal Representation \n278.  As a result of the State's failure to provide oversight, standards, and funding, \nindigent persons in New York State, including in the Counties, are not receiving, or are at severe \nand unacceptably high risk of not receiving, constitutionally and legally adequate representation, \nas measured by well-accepted national and state standards. \n279.  There is a national consensus on both the requirements of meaningful and \neffective public defense delivery systems and the tasks public defense providers must undertake \nto provide constitutionally adequate legal representation.  This consensus is reflected in \nstandards for the provision of public defense services promulgated by the American Bar \nAssociation (ABA), the National Legal Aid and Defender Association (NLADA), the National \nAdvisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals (NAC), the New York State \nDefenders Association (NYSDA), and the New York State Bar Association (NYSBA). \n280.  The public defense system in New York does not live up to these basic standards. \nAs the Kaye Commission found, \"New York's indigent defense system does not even confonn to \nthe American Bar Association's Ten Principles of a Public Defense Delivery System.\" \n281.  The public defense systems in the Counties suffer many symptoms of a broken \npublic defense system as measured by national and state standards, including: inadequate staffmg \nresulting in no representation for some defendants, particularly in arraignments where bail \ndetenninations and other critical decisions are made; incoherent or excessively restrictive \neligibility standards that exclude indigent people from getting counsel; lack of attorney-client \n68 \n\nconsultation and communication impairing the ability to present and prepare a defense and \nadvocate for pre-trial release; a lack of hiring criteria, performance standards and supervisory \ncontrols resulting in a lack of meaningful and effective counsel; a lack of training resulting in \ninexperienced and inadequate counsel; a lack of resources for investigations and expert services \nwhere they are needed to present an adequate defense; overwhelming caseloads and/or \nworkloads that prevent attorneys from serving all their clients; a lack of vertical representation, \nsuch that different attorneys represent the same defendant at various stages, impairing the \ndevelopment of an attorney-client relationship, resulting in gaps in representation during critical \nphases, and depriving clients of lawyers who understand their case; a lack of independence from \njudicial, prosecutorial and political authorities that compromises the ability to provide adequate \nrepresentation; and inadequate resources and compensation, particularly as compared to \nprosecutorial personnel, resulting in poor quality representation. \nInadequate Staffing and the Failure to Provide Representation to \nIndigent  At All Critical Stages \nD~fendants \n282.  Attorneys are not always available to represent each eligible defendant at every \ncritical stage of the criminal process, thus directly depriving defendants ofthe right to counsel. \n283.  The Spangenberg Group's report to the Kaye Commission found that public \ndefense service providers \"in most counties across the state are not staffed sufficiently to cover \nall of the numerous dockets in their counties.\"  Moreover, \"some judges do not apply the law \n[requiring appointment of counsel] ... out of fiscal concern .... \" \n284.  National and state standards for the administration of a public defense system \nrecognize that a defense attorney should be present at all critical stages of the prosecution, \nincluding arraignment.  See First Department Indigent Defense Organization Oversight \nCommittee, General Requirements for All Organized Providers of Defense Services to Indigent \n69 \n\nDefendants (1996), Performance Standard II; NLADA Guidelines for Legal Defense Systems in \nthe United States (1976), Guidelines I-1.2(a ) & V -5.11; NLADA Performance Guidelines for \nCriminal Defense Representation (1995), Guidelines 1.1 & 3.1; NLADA Standards for the \nAdministration of Assigned Counsel Systems (1989), Standards 2.1(c) & 2.5(a); NYSDA, \nStandards for Providing Constitutionally and Statutorily Mandated Legal Representation in New \nYork State (2004), Standard V(A)(3); NYSBA Standards for Providing Mandated \nRepresentation (2005), Standard B-2. \n285.  The common practice of making bail determinations during arraignment makes \nthe presence of counsel even more critical at this stage.  In a 2007 study of non-felony cases in \nNew York City, the New York City Criminal Justice Agency found that higher rates of bail \ncorrelate with longer period of pretrial detention, and longer periods of pre-trial detention, even \ncontrolling for other factors, creates an increased likelihood of conviction.  The study suggests \nthat detained defendants may be less able to assist in building a defense and that detained \ndefendants may feel pressure to plead guilty in order to gain release.  See Mary D. Philips, Ph.D., \nBail, Detention, and Non-Felony Case Outcomes, CJA Research Brief (May 2007). Thus, the \nabsence of counsel to advocate for lower bail or alternatives to pretrial incarceration at \narraigrnnent is particularly harmful. \n286.  In Onondaga County, for example, many defendants are not represented at \narraigrnnents where crucial decisions about bail are made and pleas may be offered and accepted \nwithout benefit of advice from counsel.  Attorneys assigned to cover arraignments often do not \nhave the time or resources to interview all incarcerated defendants before arraigrnnent, and if \ndefendants are not interviewed they are not represented.  Defendants who are not in custody are \nlargely not represented at arraigrnnent at all. \n70 \n\n287.  In Ontario County, many defendants are unrepresented at arraignment, and ban \ndeterminations are regularly made without the benefit of representation or advocacy by counsel. \nOne county justice reports that in the ten years he has been on the bench, he has only seen an \nattorney present at arraignment once.  Without the benefit of advocacy from counsel, bail may be \nset based on inappropriate factors.  For example, some judges frequently deny bail to \nunrepresented defendants who did not take a breathalyzer test at the time of an arrest for a DUL \n288.  In Schuyler County, defendants appear without attorneys at a.lTaignments where, \nagain, bail determinations are often made.  Defendants are therefore unable to advocate for \nappropriate bail determinations and thus face unnecessary incarceration. \n289.  In Washington County, nearly all defendants are unrepresented at arraignments \nand in the early stages of the criminal process. Defendants are sometimes pressured not to get \nlawyers by judges and prosecutors who offer a plea before counsel is assigned and imply that the \nplea offer will be withdrawn if the defendant waits for the appointment of counsel.  Defendants \nalso are unable to advocate for appropriate bail determinations and thus face urmecessary \nincarceration. \n290.  Many defendants who are umepresented in critical proceedings plead guilty \nwithout the benefit of advice from counsel and without fully understanding the consequences of \ntheir plea.  Unrepresented defendants may be forced to negotiate with the district attorney and \nthe judge directly, without the benefit of advice and representation from counsel. \n291.  Similarly, many defendants who are unrepresented in critical proceedings make \nincriminating statements that could prejudice their cases. In Schuyler County, for example, a \njudge stated to an unrepresented defendant charged accused of maldng false statements, \"It says \n71 \n\nhere you lied to the police,\" and the defendant, without counsel to advise him, confirmed that lie \nhad done so. \n292.  The Counties often fail to appoint counsel for defendants charged with lower \nlevel offenses, in plain violation of the right to counsel.  In Suffolk County, for example, judges \noften deny counsel to a defendant because he or she is facing a violation charge, even though the \ndefendant is in custody or facing jail time. \n293.  The deprivation of the right to counsel is particularly evident in the justice courts, . \nalso known as \"town and village\" courts.  These courts handle by far the largest number of cases \nin the state's criminal justice system, including violations, misdemeanors and the preliminary \nstages of felony prosecutions. \n294.  The Kaye Commission found \"that the deprivation of indigent defendants' right to \ncounsel was widespread in Town and Village Courts.  Specifically, we learned that there are \nsignificant delays in the appointment of counsel, that many indigent defendants must negotiate \npleas with the prosecution while unrepresented, and that many justices themselves lack a clear \nunderstanding as to which cases trigger the right to counsel.  The Commission also learned that \nall too often counsel for indigent defendants are not available to attend the numerous Town and \nVillage Courts.\" \n295.  The institutional providers in Suffolk, Schuyler and Washington counties do not \nhave adequate staff to cover all the justice courts in their jnrisdictions.  The assigned counsel \nprograms in Onondaga and Ontario do not have any system for ensnring that assigned counsel \nare available during critical proceedings in the justice courts.  As a result, eligible defendants go \nunrepresented at critical stages. \n72 \n\n296.  In Schuyler County, one part-time assistant public defender must cover a11non-\nfelony cases in 11 justice courts, as well as paternity, child support, and drug treatment court \ncases.  In Washington County, three part-time assistant public defenders cover 24 justice courts, \nin addition to sharing the family court docket with the Chief Public Defender. \n297.  It is not uncommon in the Counties for the right to counsel to be waived \ninappropriately in the justice courts, leaving defendants to negotiate directly with the prosecutor, \nmost often resulting in a guilty plea and sentencing at the first court appearance. \n298.  In many counties, justice courts hold \"DA nights\" in which a district attorney is \npresent to represent the prosecution in critical proceedings, but oftentimes no public defense \nattorney is available to represent indigent defendants.  During these proceedings, when no public \ndefense attorney is present, indigent defendants must negotiate and interact with both the justice \nand the prosecutor and may even enter a guilty plea, all without the benefit of counsel. \nIncoherent or Excessively Restrictive Financial Eligibility Standards and Delays in the \nAppointment ofC  ounsel \n299.  The lack of statewide eligibility standards results in incoherent and poorly \ndesigned processes for determining whether defendants are financially eligible for public \nrepresentation and for ensuring prompt assignment of counsel. \n300.  The Kaye Comrnission found that \"[t]here are no clear standards regarding \neligibility determinations and procedures,\" and that \"[i]n the absence of uniform guidelines, \nsubjective and sometimes disparate eligibility determinations are made across the state, and \ncompeting concerns such as county funding and workload may become inappropriate factors in \nthe determination.\" \n301.  National and state standards for the administration ofa public defense system \nmandate clear guidelines governing eligibility determinations, in order to ensure that defendants \n73 \n\nwho need public representation are not denied their right to counsel.  See NLADA Guidelines for \nLegal Defense Systems in the United States (1976), Guidelines 1-1.5, 1-1.6; NAC Report of the \nTask Force on Courts (1973), Standard 13.2; NYSDA, Standards for Providing Constitutionally \nand Statutorily Mandated Legal Representation in New York State (2004), Standard VII; \nNYSBA Standards for Providing Mandated Representation (2005), Standards C-I, C-2. \n302.  National and state standards for the provision of public defense services also \nmandate that defense counsel be assigned as soon as possible after arrest, detention or a request \nfor counsel.  See ABA Ten Principles, Principle 3; ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Defense \nFunction (3d ed. 1993), Standard 4-3.6; ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Providing Defense \nServices (3d ed.1992), Standard 5-6.1; NLADA Guidelines for Legal Defense Systems in the \nUnited States (1976), Standard 1-1.2; NLADA Standards for the Administration of Assigned \nCounsel Systems (1989), Standard 2.5; NLADA Guidelines for Negotiating and Awarding \nGovemmental Contracts for Criminal Defense Services (1984), Guidelines III-18; NAC Report \nofthe Task Force on Courts (1973), Standard 13.1; NYSDA, Standards for Providing \nConstitutionally and Statutorily Mandated Legal Representation in New York State (2004), \nStandard V(A)(3); NYSBA Standards for Providing Mandated Representation (2005), Standard \nB-1, B-2, B-4. \n303.  In Onondaga County, the assigned counsel program maintains written standards \nfor eligibility that improperly exclude eligible defendants from representation.  For example, \nownership of a home - even a mobile home - automatically precludes assigmnent of counsel, \nwithout consideration of the value of the home, the equity in the home, or the ability to obtain a \nloan against the home.  The standards also fail to consider whether clients carry any debts that \nwould prevent them from being able to afford a lawyer. \n74 \n\n304.  Minors in Onondaga County are excluded from representation based on parental \nincome, even if the parent will not pay for a lawyer, and based on lack of parental cooperation in \nproviding income information. \n305.  In practice, moreover, eligibility determinations in Onondaga County are made by \neach judge according to his or her different and often subjective standards and procedures.  The \nadministrator of the assigned counsel program recently sent a letter from the county pressuring \njudges to assign counsel in fewer cases because of the county's fiscal concerns. \n306.  A lack of clarity regarding eligibility and assigmnent procedures in Onondaga \nCounty results in occasions where assigned counsel will attempt to coerce public defense clients \ninto paying fees, a phenomenon, known as \"flipping\" a client.  For example, one client reported \nthat his assigned counsel attorney demanded $7500, with a $2500 retainer, before he would do \nany work on the client's case.  The attorney also phoned the client's wife to demand payment. \nThe client has not been able to pay the attorney and has remained incarcerated for over a month \nwhile his attorney persists in adjourning his court dates.  A client of another assigned counsel \nattorney paid his appOinted lawyer $2000 that he borrowed from his family for the promise of a \n\"better result.\" \n307.  In Ontario County, judges make initial eligibility decisions based on their \nsubjective determinations of a defendant's financial status, rad1er than through any standard \nprocess applying clear and uniform guidelines.  Ultimate discretion over eligibility decisions \nrests with the assigned counsel administrator, with no avenue for judicial appeal. \n308.  Schuyler County has excessively stringent eligibility standards that result in the \nexclusion of clients who should qualifY for a public defender.  For example, owning a car is \nconsidered evidence that a client can afford a private lawyer, regardless of the value of the car, \n75 \n\nand without accounting for the fact that a car is a basic necessity in rural Schuyler.  One judge \nindicated to a defendant that ifhe made more than $16,000 a year, he would not qualify.  Despite \nhaving one of the highest poverty rates in the State of New York, over the past four years nearly \nhalf of the clients referred to the Schuyler County public defender have been deemed \"not \nindigent.\" Many people who are considered eligible in surrounding counties are deemed \nineligible for public defender services in Schuyler. \n309.  Defendants in Schuyler County under the age of 21 are often disqualified based \non parental income, regardless of whether the defendant is able to rely on that income. \n310.  In Suffolk County, eligibility determinations are based on income and the value of \nany assets that the applicant owns without accounting for debts, the amount of equity in any \nassets, other financial obligations, or the actual cost of retaining a private attorney to defend \nagainst the relevant charge.  One defendant was denied a legal aid attorney after informing the \ncourt that he eamed $12 per hour and that his weekly income after taxes is approximately $380. \nWithout inquiring fUlther into the defendant's financial status, family obligations, or ability to \npay for an attorney, the judge informed the defendant that he would need to retain a private \nattorney.  Forced between paying rent and paying to retain an attorney, the defendant chose to \npay his rent and proceed without counsel. \n311.  Clients under the age of 21 in Suffolk County may be excluded from \nrepresentation based on parental income, even if they are estranged from their parents or their \nparents refuse to pay for a lawyer. \n312.  In many of the justice courts in Suffolk County, eligibility determinations are \nmade by judges based on arbitrary and subj ective standards, often resulting in the demal of \ncounsel for individuals who should be found eligible for public defense services. \n76 \n\n313.  In Washington County, eligibility determinations are made by the public defender \noffice based on written guidelines that account only for income and family size and do not \naccount for debts and other significant financial obligations. \n314.  In many counties, the system for determining eligibility results in serious delays \nand barriers to the appointment of counsel.  For example, there are often delays in the \nappointment of counsel because of confusion on the part of applicants regarding the process for \napplying, the failure of judges to properly inform eligible defendants about the process, failure to \nappoint counsel inmlediately at arraignment, and difficulties in sorting out conflicts in multiple \ndefendant felony cases. \n315.  In Ontario County, for example, it is not uncommon for incarcerated clients to \nwait several days before leaming the names of their attorneys and having an opportunity to \ncommunicate with them.  In Onondaga County, one client languished in jail for three weeks \nbefore learning the name of his assigned counsel. \n316.  In Schuyler County, clients sometimes must wait a month or more after arrest \nbefore being assigned an attorney.  One client applied for counsel the day she was arrested but, \nafter not hearing from the public defender's office for over a month, gave up and asked a public \ndefender from an adjacent county to represent her. \nLack ofA  ttorney-Client Contact and Communication \n317.  Indigent defendants in the Counties suffer from a lack of access to and \ncommunication with their public defense counsel. \n318.  The Kaye Commission found that it is common to find public defense attorneys \nwho do \"not visit their clients in jail, rerum phone calls, answer letters, or conduct even minimal \ninvestigations of their clients' cases.  In some counties, the only attorney-client contact available \n77 \n\nis through collect calls to counsel, which many counsel refuse to accept.  In a number of \ncounties, attorney-client contact occurs only when the defendant is brought to court for a \nscheduled appearance.\" \n319.  National and state standards for public defense systems recognize that client \ncontact and communication are essential elements of meaningful and effective representation. \nSee ABA Ten Principles, Principle 4 (commentary); ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, \nProsecution Function and Defense Function (3d ed. 1993), Standards 4-2.1, 4-3.1,4-3.8; \nNLADA Guidelines for Legal Defense Systems in the United States (1976), Guideline 1-1.3(a); \nNLADA Performance Gnidelines for Criminal Defense Representation (1995), Guideline 1.3 ( c); \nNAC Report of the Task Force on Courts (1973), Standard 13.3; NYSDA, Standards for \nProviding Constitutionally and Statutorily Mandated Legal Representation in New York State \n(2004), Standard VIII(A)(5), (7); NYSBA Standards for Providing Mandated Representation \n(2005), Standard 1-3. \n320.  In Onondaga County, the assigned counsel program does not monitor or \nencourage attorney-client contacts.  Indeed, the program frequently cuts vouchers for \"too much\" \nclient contact.  Most assigned counsel attorneys are unable or unwilling to visit their clients in \njail and conduct all client contact prior to court appearances.  One client reported having been \nincarcerated on misdemeanor charges for almost five months and never having spoken with his \nattorney about his case.  Another attorney's client complained to the Onondaga Human Rights \nCommission that he had been in jail for more than 200 days without being indicted and had not \nseen his assigned counsel attorney in several months.  When confronted with this fact by the \nOnondaga County Human Rights Commission, the attorney responded that he could not visit his \nclient more often because \"[Onondaga] County will not pay for superfluous jail visits.\" \n78 \n\n321.  In Onondaga County, assigned counsel under pressure of excessive caseloads \nfrequently do not have time to speak to a client about anything other than a plea offer.  One client \nreported that, after being unable to reach his attorney during several weeks injail, he attempted \nto discuss his case with her before a court appearance but she interrupted him, said she \"doesn't \nwant to hear it,\" and refused to discuss anything but the prosecutor's plea offer.  When the client \nexpressed discomfort with the offer, the attorney began to walk away, swore at the clien4 and \ntold him that ifhe wanted to go to trial he'd have to find another attorney. \n322.  Many incarcerated clients in Onondaga are unable to speak with their attorneys \nbecause their offices will not accept collect calls and their voicemail boxes, which are accessible \nby direct line from the jail, are always full. \n323.  The Ontario County assigned counsel program also does not monitor or ensure \nadequate attorney-client contacts.  Incarcerated clients are often unable to reach their attorneys \nand do not receive timely updates about the status of their cases. \n324.  In Schuyler County, incarcerated inmates often cannot reach their public defender \nbecause their public defender's office is not equipped to or will not accept collect phone calls, \nwhich are some inmates' only means of making telephone calls.  Released clients also may have \ntrouble meeting with their attorney, particularly as the conflict defender and most assigned \ncounsel attorneys maintain offices in other counties that are difficult and expensive to reach. \n325.  In Suffolk County, clients often complain that their attorneys do not retnrn their \ncalls and only want to talk about plea bargains.  Clients are often pressured to accept plea \nbargains without any explanation of alternative options.  Incarcerated clients rarely meet with \ntheir Legal Aid attorney outside of court appearances. \n79 \n\n326.  In Washington County, public defense attorneys rarely meet with clients outside \nof court appearances, most often in public places such as at counsel's table within earshot ofthe \njudge and the prosecutor.  Incarcerated clients have particular trouble communicating with their \nattorneys.  Although the county jail has established a system for allowing toll-free legal calls \nfrom the jails, not all the public defenders have taken advantage of this system. Communication \nis so infrequent that one public defense attorney even arranged a plea bargain before ever having \nmet his client.  The bargain was struck based on the prosecutor's version of the facts then \npresented to the client in a public hallway outside the court as ajaU accompli. \n327.  In all the Counties, public defense lawyers frequently waive client's rights, such \nas the right to a preliminary hearing or the right to testifY before a Grand Jury, without consulting \nwith their clients or explaining the reasons for the waiver, sometimes against their clients' \nexpress instructions.  For example, in Onondaga County, a client strongly wished to testifY \nbefore the Grand Jury in order to present an alibi and offer witnesses in support of his alibi, but \nrepeated phone calls to his assigned counsel attorney from the jail, as well as calls from the \nclient's family, were ignored, and the client was unable to assert his right to testify or even \ndiscuss the option with his lawyer. \n328.  A lack of attorney-client communication particularly harms clients with mental \nhealth issues. In Suffolk County, for example, a 22-year-old veteran of the Iraq War who was \ndiagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome upon his return from Iraq was represented by a \nLegal Aid attorney who failed to communicate with the client at any time before, during, or after \narraigument. As a result, the attorney did not leam of or address the client's mental health issues. \nWithout access to mental health treatment, the client was almost immediately arrested again and \nspent two days in jail before being assigned to a second Legal Aid attorney who also failed to \n80 \n\ncommunicate with the client about his mental health issues.  Only when the client's mother \ndirectly communicated with the judge about the defendant's Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome \nwas the client given a mental examination and offered assistance. \n329.  A lack of attorney-client contact often results in prejudice to a client's case or \nunnecessary incarceration.  For example, in Onondaga County, a client facing misdemeanor \ncharges missed a court appearance because his attorney never informed him of the court date and \nnever returned the client's repeated phone calls.  As a result, a bench warrant was issued and the \nclient was arrested, denied bail, and spent almost a month in jail.  The client reported that he felt \npressure to plead guilty just so he could get out of jail, even though he felt he had a valid \ndefense. \nLack ofA  ttorney Hiring Criteria, Performance Standards and Supervisory Controls \n330.  There are no meaningful attorney hiring criteria, perfonnance standards or \nsupervisory controls to ensure basic quality of representation among public defense service \nproviders. \n331.  The Kaye Commission found that \"[d]espite the existence of various sets of \nstandards for representation that bar associations have issued over the years, there is no single set \nof standards that actuaIJy governs what 'adequate' indigent defense services means.\" Moreover, \nbecause the practice standards that exist are not enforceable in New York, \"in some areas, \nsubstandard practice has become the acceptable norm.\" \n332.  National and state standards for the administration of a public defense system \nstate that written hiring criteria are necessary to ensure that an attorney's ability, training, and \nexperience match the complexity of the cases he or she faces.  See First Department Indigent \nDefense Organization Oversight Committee, General Requirements for All Organized Providers \n81 \n\nof Defense Services to Indigent Defendants (1996), Performance Standard II; NLADA \nGuidelines for Legal Defense Systems in the United States (1976), Standard V-5.9;  NYSBA \nStandards for Providing Mandated Representation (2005), Standard E-2; see also ABA Ten \nPrinciples, Principle 6 (requiring that counsel's ability, training, and experience match the \ncomplexity of the case); NLADA Performance Guidelines for Criminal Defense Representation \n(1995), Guideline 1.2(a) (same). \n333.  National and state standards also mandate that a public defense system maintain \nwritten performance standards complemented by a system of active supervisory control.  See \nABA Ten Principles, Principle 10; First Department Indigent Defense Organization Oversight \nCommittee, General Requirements for All Organized Providers of Defense Services to Indigent \nDefendants (1996), Performance Standards IV & VI; NLADA Guidelines for Legal Defense \nSystems in the United States (1976), Standard V- 5.4;  NLADA Standards for the Administration \nof Assigned Counsel Systems (1989), Standard 4.4; NYSDA, Standards for Providing \nConstitutionally and Statutorily Mandated Legal Representation in New York State (2004), \nStandard VI(E); NYSBA Standards for Providing Mandated Representation (2005), Standard J-l \nto J-9. \n334.  The criteria for placement on the assigned counsel panels in the Counties are \nminimal and do not create any meaningful check on the quality of representation.  In Schuyler \nCounty, for example, any willing attorney, no matter how inexperienced, can be appointed to the \nmost complex felony case.  In Washington County, an individual with knowledge of the system \nreported that some attorneys on the assigned counsel panel are \"barely qualified to practice law.\" \nAn attorney on the assigned counsel panel in Washington reported that he had been assigned a \ncomplex felony case straight out of law school, even though he thought that was \"unfair\" to his \n82 \n\nclient.  In Onondaga County, the criteria for getting on the panels are minimal and may be \nwaived. \n335.  The institutional providers in Schuyler, Suffolk and Washington counties do not \nhave any written hiring criteria for attorneys. \n336.  None of the Counties have any binding or enforceable written performance \nstandards for attorney conduct. \n337.  In Suffolk COlllIty, Legal Aid attorneys are evaluated and promoted almost \nexclusively based on the number of cases that they dispose of each year.  Thus, there is an \nenormous incentive to encourage pleas regardless of whether they are in the best interest of the \nclients.  Consequently, less than one percent of all cases are brought to trial.  For example, one \nLegal Aid Society client found himself represented by a new attorney at a court proceeding \nseveral days after his arrest.  Prior to the proceeding, the attorney met with the client for only 5 \nminutes and advised the client to accept a plea bargain even though the offer equaled the \nmaximum sentence for the pending charges.  The attorney refused to seek a reduction in the \ncharges or to attempt to negotiate a better plea offer.  Because no other options were explained to \nhim, the defendant accepted the plea bargain, believing that he had no choice but to do so. \n338.  In Onondaga County, because there are no supervisory controls over assigned \ncounsel, attorneys who have repeatedly been removed from representing individual clients by \njudges for cause are still permitted to remain on the assigned counsel panel lists and receive new \nclient assignments. \n339.  Moreover, because Onondaga County has no meaningful system for handling \ncomplaints and disciplining attorneys for inadequate performance, clients are often not able to \nget an attorney removed for cause when removal would be appropriate.  For example, Plaintiff \n83 \n\nRichard Love, who is African-American, asked a judge to remove his attorney after his attorney \nmade a racist comment to him during a court appearance.  The judge asked if Mr. Love could \nafford his own attorney.  When Mr. Love reported that he could not, the judge replied, \"then \nyou're stuck.\"  Only when a different judge was assigned to Mr. Love's case was his attorney \nremoved and a new attorney assigned. \nLack a/Training \n340.  Public defense service providers in the Counties are not subject to any statewide \ntraining requirements related to criminal defense representation and are not provided with \nadequate access to training programs. \n341.  The Kaye Commission found that \"very few institutional providers have in place \nviable training programs and ... [i]n regard to assigned counsel and contract defense programs, \ntraining ranges from non-existent to the barely adequate.\" \n342.  Onondaga, Ontario, Schuyler, and Washington counties have no training \nrequirements for public defenders or assigned counsel other than the standard Continning Legal \nEducation (CLE) requirements for active membership in the Bar, which do not require \nspecialized courses in criminal defense practice.  Furthellllore, these Counties do not allocate any \nfunding for public defense service providers to fulfill their CLE requirements. \n343.  In Suffolk County, there are no fornlal training requirements for attorneys beyond \nthe requirement to obtain some of their annual CLE credits in criminal law.  Lack of funding \noften prohibits attorneys from participating in outside training workshops and seminars. \n344.  One effect of the lack of training is that many public defense attorneys are \nunaware of, and thus unable to advocate for, available alternatives to incarceration for their \nclients.  For example, in Suffolk County, a Legal Aid attorney incorrectly informed a defendant \n84 \n\nthat he did not qualify for a drug treatment program that can serve as an alternative to \nincarceration.  The defendant perfonned his own research and learned that he did in fact qualify. \nUnable to contact his attorney after repeated attempts, the defendant wrote to the judge, who \nappointed a new attorney and approved the defendant's admission to the treatment program. \n345.  National and state standards for public defense systems recognize that meaningful \nand effective representation cannot occur without a mandatory, universal training program for \npublic defense providers. See ABA Ten Principles, Principle 9 (commentary); ABA Standards \nfor Criminal Justice, Providing Defense Services (3d ed. 1992), Standard 5-1.5; NLADA \nDefender Training and Development Standards (1997), Standard 1.1; NLADA Guidelines for \nLegal Defense Systems in the United States (1976), Guideline V-5.7, 5.8; NLADA Guidelines \nfor Negotiating and Awarding Govemmental Contracts for Criminal Defense Services (1984), \nGuideline III-I 7; NLADA Standards for the Administration of Assigned Counsel Systems \n(1989), Standards 4.2, 4.3.1, 4.3.2, 4.4; NLADA Perfonnance Guidelines for Criminal Defense \nRepresentation (1995), Guideline l.2(b); NAC Report of the Task Force on Courts (1973), \nStandard 13.16; NYSDA, Standards for Providing Constitutionally and Statutorily Mandated \nLegal Representation in New York State (2004), Standard VI(A), (B); NYSBA Standards for \nProviding Mandated Representation (2005), Standard F-l, F-2; N.Y. CLS Sup. Ct. § 613.9 \n(2007). \nLack a/Support Services and the Failure to Conduct Investigations and Seek Expert Services \n346.  Public defense service providers in the Counties are not provided with the \nresources required to obtain necessary support services, including investigators and experts. \nWithout these services, preparing a constitutionally and legally adeqnate defense for clients is \noften impossible. \n85 \n\n347.  The Kaye Commission found that public defense services throughout the State are \nmarked by \"inadequate provision of and lack of requests for expert and investigative services.\" \n348.  National and state standards for public defense systems recognize that the \nprovision of meaningful and effective assistance of counsel requires adequate support staff, \nincluding investigators, and that conducting investigations is a key component of competent \ncounsel.  See ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Providing Defense Services (3d ed. 1992), \nStandard 5-1.4; ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Prosecution Function and Defense Function \n(3d ed. 1993), Standard 4-4.1(a); NLADA Performance Guidelines for Criminal Defense \nRepresentation (1995), Guideline 4.1; NLADA Guidelines for Legal Defense Systems in the \nUnited States (1976), Guideline IV -4.1; NLADA, Guidelines for Negotiating and Awarding \nGovernmental Contracts for Criminal Defense Services (1984), Standard III-9; NLADA \nStandards for the Administration of Assigned Counsel Systems (1989), Standard 4.6; NAC \nReport of the Task Force on Courts (1973), Standard 13.14; NYSDA, Standards for Providing \nConstitutionally and Statutorily Mandated Legal Representation in New York State (2004), \nStandard VlU(A)(6); NYSBA Standards for Providing Mandated Representation (2005), \nStandard H-l, H-6.  See also N.Y. County Law §§ 722, 722-c (2007). \n349.  National and state standards for public defense systems recognize that a \nconstitutionally and legally adequate public defense system must allow for the appointment of \nexperts where necessary to present a meaningful and effective defense.  See ABA Standards for \nCriminal Justice, Providing Defense Services, Standard 5-1.4; NLADA Guidelines for Legal \nDefense Systems in the United States (1976), Guideline III-3.1; NLADA, Guidelines for \nNegotiating and Awarding Governmental Contracts for Criminal Defense Services (1984), \nGuideline III-8; NLADA Perfonnance Guidelines for Criminal Defense Representation (1995), \n86 \n\nGuideline 4.1 (b)(7); NAC Report of the Task Force on Courts (1973), Standard 13.14; NYSDA, \nStandards for Providing Constitutionally and Statutorily Mandated Legal Representation in New \nYork State (2004), Standard VJII(A)(8)(c); NYSBA Standards for Providing Mandated \nRepresentation (2005), Standards H-I, H-6; N.Y. County Law §§ 722, 722-c (2007). \n350.  In 2006, based on data reported by the counties, New York State spent an average \nof$I1.80 per case on investigative services and $5.65 per case on expert services. \n351.  In Onondaga and Ontario counties, as is common among counties that rely on an \nassigned counsel system, assigned counsel must apply to the Court for approval of funds for \ninvestigative and expert services, and there is often tacit pressure not to apply for such services \nin order to keep costs down. \n352.  In Onondaga County, some judges are reluctant to order expenditures of county \nfunds on investigators and experts, and many assigoed counsel have given up requesting funds \nfor such services.  One judge has noted that, mindful of costs, he requires attorneys to provide \n\"lots of detail\" as to their need for investigator services. Not surprisingly, this judge reports that \nhe \"does not receive requests for investigators ... except in the most serious cases.\" \n353.  In Ontario County, some courts report receiving as few as one or two requests per \nyear for expert or investigative services. \n354.  In Schuyler and Washington counties, the public defender offices have inadequate \nsupport staff, have no staff paralegals or investigators, and do not have the capacity to conduct \ninvestigations.  In Schuyler County, public defenders have been forced to use the State's experts \nin their defense of their clients.  Washington County reports having spent no money on expert \nservices in 2005 and 2006. \n87 \n\n355.  In Suffolk County, the Legal Aid Society employs only six staff investigators to \nsupport 60 attorneys and investigate approximately 26,000 cases per year, despite the fact that \nABA standards suggest there should be one staff investigator for every three attorneys.  ABA \nTen Principles, Principle 8 (commentary n.23).  Most of these investigators hold other jobs, are \navailable only part-time, and have other administrative responsibilities outside of performing \ninvestigations.  The Suffolk County Legal Aid Society also has no paralegals or support staff \nwith legal training.  Additionally, attorneys must sometimes share computers, impeding their \nability to conduct online research and perform other functions necessary to represent their clients \nmeaningfully and effectively \n356.  The Suffolk County Legal Aid Society reports having spent no money on experts \nfrom 2002 to 2006.  In 2006, only 2% of the assigned counsel program's reported expenses were \nattributed to expert services. \nExcessive Caseloads and/or Workloads \n357.  Public defense service providers in the Counties operate under the burden of \nexcessive caseloads and/or workloads that compromise their ability to provide effective \nrepresentation to their clients. \n358.  None of the Counties has meaningful, written caseload or workload standards or \nany effective mechanism to monitor attorney caseloads and workloads. \n359.  The Kaye Commission found that \"virtually all institutional defenders ... labor \nunder excessive caseloads.\" \n88 \n\n360.  In the Counties that rely on assigned counsel, attorneys are free to represent, in \naddition to their private clients and appointments from other counties, as many appointed clients \nas they choose.  In Counties that rely on an institutional defender, excessive overall caseloads \nand workloads reduce public defense attorneys' ability to meaningfully and effectively represent \neach client.  In Washington County, one public defender reported that he had \"too many cases\" \nand admitted that his high caseload puts pressure on him to take pleas for his clients even when \nhe believes the client has a strong defense. \n361.  The problem of excessive caseloads is compounded in many of the Counties by a \nreliance on part-time public defenders with competing private practices that distract from their \npublic defense docket and create excessive caseload burdens.  The institutional defenders in \nSchuyler and Washington counties, for example, rely exclusively on part-time assistant \ndefenders, and the chief defenders in both counties have private practices in addition to their \nostensibly \"full time\" public defender jobs. \n362.  The problem is further compounded by the fact that all public defense service \nproviders in the Counties are also responsible for handling Family Court cases, which many \nattorneys report require even more time and resources than criminal cases. \n363.  Excessive caseloads and workloads place enonnous pressure on public defense \nattorneys to secure plea agreements and avoid going to trial, even when this decision may not be \nin the best interests of their clients.  Across the State, based on data reported by the Counties in \n2006, less than 2% of public defense cases are taken to trial.  In the Counties, the trial rate is \n1.4%, or only 463 out of more than 32,000 reported public defense cases. \n364.  The strong pressure to obtain early pleas also places pressure on attorneys to \naccept plea offers that waive clients' rights to appeal and other post-conviction remedies. \n89 \n\nUnsurprisingly, therefore, only a very small percentage of criminal convictions in New York are \nappealed.  In 2006, according to data reported by the Counties, the percentage of criminal cases \nappealed in Onondaga, Ontario, Schuyler, Suffolk and Washington collectively was just 1.3%. \nWashington County reported having no appeals in 2006, while Suffolk and Schuyler counties \nreportedly less than 1%   of cases were appealed. \n365.  National and state standards for the provision of public defense services provide \ncaseload management is an essential element of a constitutional public defense system.  See \nABA Ten Principles, Principle 5 (commentary); ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, \nProsecution Function and Defense Function (3d ed. 1993), Standard 4-1.3(e ); ABA Standards for \nCriminal Justice: Providing Defense Services (3d ed. 1992), Standard 5-5.3; NLADA Guidelines \nfor Legal Defense Systems in the United States (1976), Guidelines V-5.1, 5.3; NLADA, \nGuidelines for Negotiating and Awarding Governmental Contracts for Criminal Defense \nServices (1984), Guidelines III-6, III-I 2; NLADA Standards for the Administration of Assigned \nCounsel Systems (1989), Standard 4.1.2; NYSDA, Standards for Providing Constitutionally and \nStatutorily Mandated Legal Representation in New York State (2004), Standards IV, III(E); \nABA Comm. on Ethics and Profl Responsibility, Formal Op. 06-441 (2006); NYSBA Standards \nfor Providing Mandated Representation (2005), Standards G-I, G-2. \nLack of Vertical Representation \n366.  The Counties' public defense systems are often designed so that indigent \ndefendants are provided with different public defense attorneys at different stages ofthe \nprosecutorial process.  Such \"horizontal\" representation creates a barrier to forming a meaningful \nattorney-client relationship and developing a client's trust.  Moreover, when a defendant's case is \nbetween stages, it simply lies dormant with no representation being provided, no investigations \n90 \n\nconducted, and no counsel to advise the client until the case is assigned a new attorney at the \nnext stage. \n367.  The Spangenberg Group report found that, even though it diminishes the quality \nof representation, many public defense service providers provide this kind of \"horizontal\" \nrepresentation \"for the sake of efficiency.\" \n368.  National and state standards for the administration of a public defense system \nprovide that, as a general rule, the same attorney should continuously represent the client until \ncompletion of the case.  See ABA Ten Principles, Principle 7; NLADA Guidelines for Legal \nDefense Systems in the United States (1976), Guideline 5.11; NLADA Standards for the \nAdministration of Assigned Counsel Systems (1989), Standard 2.6; NYSDA, Standards for \nProviding Constitutionally and Statutorily Mandated Legal Representation in New York State \n(2004), Standard V(A)(4); NYSBA Standards for Providing Mandated Representation (2005), \nStandard 1-5.  See also N. Y. County Law § 717 (2007). \n369.  In Onondaga County, for example, certain assigned counsel are assigned \n\"arraignment days\" in the City and County courts to represent felony defendants being arraigned \nin any given day.  Some time after arraignment, clients are assigned a different lawyer. \n370.  In Suffolk County, defendants charged with felonies are almost always assigned \ndifferent attorneys before and after indictment, often following substantial delays, and many \ndefendants find that they are represented by a different attorney every time they appear in court. \nAs a result, criminal defendants facing felony charges must learn to trust and communicate with \na new attorney immediately after they are indicted, knowing that their previous attorney will no \nlonger be able to help them. \n91 \n\n371.  In Schuyler and Washington counties, the system of assigning particular lawyers \nto particular courts means that nearly all felony defendants arraigned in a justice court are \nassigned to a new attorney when the case is transferred out of the justice court and into the \ncounty court, often after substantial delays. \nThe Lack ofP olitical and Professional Independence \n372.  The system of county-based funding and administration causes a lack of \nindependence from judicial, prosecutorial and political authorities for public defense services \nproviders in the Counties. \n373.  The Kaye Commission found that, because of the State's abdication of public \ndefense funding and administration responsibilities to the counties, \"New York fails to ensure the \nindependence of its indigent defense providers who are too often subject to undue interference \nfrom the counties that fund them.\" \n374.  No fewer than seven county public defenders and legal aid society directors \nfrom Saratoga, Rensselaer, Essex, Greene, Steuben, Onondaga, and Westchester counties \ntestified before the Kaye Commission, citing specific instances of political interference with their \nability to provide meaningful and effective representation to their indigent clients. \n375.  National and state standards for the administration of a public defense system \nrequire professional and political independence for public defense services providers in order to \nguarantee meaningful and effective representation of indigent defendants.  See ABA Ten \nPrinciples, Principle 1; ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Providing Defense Services (3d ed. \n1992), Standards 5-1.3, 5-1.6; NLADA Guidelines for Legal Defense Systems in the United \nStates (1976), Guideline 2.18; NLADA Standards for the Administration of Assigned Counsel \nSystems (1989), Standard 2.2; NLADA Guidelines for Negotiating and Awarding Governmental \n92 \n\nContracts for Criminal Defense Services (1984), Guideline II-I; NAC Report of the Task Force \non Courts (1973), Standard 13.8; NYSDA, Standards for Providing Constitutionally and \nStatutorily Mandated Legal Representation in New York State (2004), Standards II, III-A; \nNYSBA Standards for Providing Mandated Representation (2005), Standard A-I. See also DR 2-\n103 (22 NYCRR 1200.8). \n376.  In Onondaga, for example, the director of a legal aid society that formerly \nhandled a large percentage of the county's criminal docket reported the following exchange with \na county legislator to the Kaye Commission: \nA legislative committee member asked me the following series of questions in a \nhostile tone of voice, starting with, isn't it true that the legal aid society has a \npolicy of not disposing of cases at arraignment? I answered that that was in fact \nour policy because we were never given adequate resources to be able to meet our \nclients in j ail before arraignment or to have staff present to discuss cases with \nthem before arraignment. Therefore, it would be a violation of an ethical \n[obligation] to our clients to do so. The next question was, isn't it true that you \nmake motions in every case? The answer unfortunately was no. We don't have the \nresources to do that .... The next question was, isn't it true that you served \ndemands to produce in every case? The answer was yes. That is the statutory \nrequirement to preserve our client's rights to discovery. And, finally, I was asked, \nisn't it true that you require a written response from the DA's office to those \ndemands? ... These questions were very troubling because they imply that we \nwere doing something wrong by fulfilling our legal and ethical responsibility to \nour clients and that we were subjected to criticism for providing vigorous \nrepresentation to our clients ... I was subsequently told by a member of the \njudiciary ... that the word on the street was that we lost the city court program \nbecause we delayed cases. My response then and my response [now] is, one \nperson's delay is another person's due process. \nShortly after this exchange, the county terminated the legal aid society'S contract to perfonn \ncertain criminal public defense representation for Onondaga County. \n377.  In Onondaga County, rather than leaving staffing decisions to the Assigned \nCounsel Program, judges make the decision not only whether counsel should be appointed, but \nwhich lawyers to appoint to cases in their courtroom.  This system creates a risk, and a \n93 \n\nperception among attorneys, that lawyers who do not ensure swift disposition of their client's \ncases, even where swift disposition means sacrificing zealous representation, will not receive \nappointments from judges who are concemed about meeting state-set standards and goals for \nreducing docket congestion. \n378.  In both Onondaga and Ontario counties, assigned counsel must obtain judicial \napproval before spending any funds on investigators or expert services, thus subjecting counsel's \njudgment regarding the services necessary for zealous advocacy to a court's discretion. \n379.  There is no independent board or commission that oversees public defense \nservices in Schuyler County. The Chief Public Defender is appointed by the county legislature \nand must lobby the legislature for necessary budget allocations and meet performance-based \nstandards set by political actors in order to obtain sufficient funding. \n380.  In Suffolk County, the Legal Aid Society must obtain annual budget approval \nfrom the Suffolk County legislature.  The Legal Aid Society must submit a detailed budget \nrequest and answer detailed questions about expenditures at a hearing before the county \nexecutive.  Based on that hearing, the county executive recommends a budget allocation for the \nLegal Aid Society and the legislature votes on the budget.  Most of the time, the Legal Aid \nSociety obtains less than the amount it has requested. \n381.  In Washington County, there is no independent board or commission that \noversees public defense services.  The public defender is selected by means of a low-bid process \nin which the County Board of Supervisors appoints the candidate in part on the basis of a \nproposal to run the office most cheaply over a two-year period.  The Board of Supervisors \napproves the annual budget and must separately sign off on any expenditure for investigators or \nexperts in individual felony cases.  The county also accepts the low-bid proposal for conflict \n94 \n\ndefender services solely for cases arising out of the state prisons located in the county. \nMoreover, judges have unlimited discretion to reduce assigned counsel's bills for services.  As a \nresult, in 2006, per capita county expenditure for public defense in Washlngton County was \nunder $7.50, well below the state average of $21.21. \nInadequate Compensation and Lack ofP  arity with Prosecutorial Counterparts \n382.  Public defense service providers in the Counties are, in general, inadequately \ncompensated and lack the resources needed to provide effective representation. \n383.  National and state standards recognize the importance of adequately \ncompensating both assigned counsel lawyers and institutional public defense service providers. \nSee ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Providing Defense Services (3d ed. 1992), Standard 5-\n2.4; NLADA Guidelines for Legal Defense Systems in the United States (1976), Guidelines III-\n3.1,3.2; NLADA, Guidelines for Negotiating and Awarding Governmental Contracts for \nCriminal Defense Services (1984), Guideline III-I 0; NLADA Standards for the Administration \nof Assigned Counsel Systems (1989), Standard 4.7.1; NAC Report of the Task Force on Courts \n(1973), Standards 13.7, 13.11; NYSDA, Standards for Providing Constitutionally and Statutorily \nMandated Legal Representation in New York State (2004), Standard m(C); NYSSA Standards \nfor Providing Mandated Representation (2005), Standard K-3.  See also N.Y. County Law § 722-\nb (2007). \n384.  In the federal system, guidelines state that the salaries and support given to federal \npublic defenders must be substantially similar to that provided to Assistant United States \nAttorneys in the Department of Justice.  See Guidelines for the Administration of the Criminal \nrv, \nJustice Act and Related Statutes, Chapter  4.02 A(3). \n95 \n\n385.  National and state standards also hold that comparable funding for prosecutorial \nand public defense services is a key measure of the health of a criminal justice system.  See ABA \nTen Principles, Principle 8; NLADA Guidelines for Legal Defense Systems in the United States \n(1976), Guideline 3.2; NYSDA, Standards for Providing Constitutionally and Statutorily \nMandated Legal Representation in New York State (2004), Standard m(C); NYSBA Standards \nfor Providing Mandated Representation (2005), Standard K-l. \n386.  In 1965, the New York State legislature passed Article I8-B, setting the rates of \ncompensation for private assigned counsel at $10 per hour for out-of-court work and $15 per \nhour for in-court time. The State raised rates slightly in 1977 and 1986, but rates remained \nstagnant from 1986 until 2003 until, following a lawsuit brought by the New York County \nLawyers Association, the Legislature raised the rates to $60 per hour for misdemeanors and \nlesser offenses and $75 per hour for felonies and all other eligible cases. \n387.  As a result of the financial pressure caused by the rise in lS-B rates, assigned \ncounsel programs place pressure on assigned counsel to keep costs low and on assigned counsel \nadministrators to cut vouchers, even at the expense of the client's needs and interests. \n388.  In Onondaga County, for example, a county court judge recently wrote an opinion \ncriticizing the assigned counsel program for \"incessant bureaucratic nitpicking\" in cutting \nattorney vouchers for reimbursement, remarking that \"good attorneys\" were being driven out of \nthe program and that the pattern of voucher-cutting \"almost amounts to an on-going violation of \nthe Sixth Amendment.\" \n389.  In Ontario County, assigned counsel are paid hourly rates that must cover the \ncosts of health insurance, retirement savings, and overhead costs such as support staff, desks, \ncomputers, legal research expenses, and office supplies.  Assigned counsel are often not \n96 \n\ncompensated for all the actual time devoted to their cases.  For example, the county will not \nreimburse assigned counsel for any time spent traveling to the various courts throughout the \ncounty. \n390.  The gross disparity between the resources available to public defenders and the \nresources available to prosecutors highlights the chronic under-funding of public defense in New \nYork, especially in light of the fact that public defense services providers must cover not only \ncriminal prosecutions but also child abuse and neglect cases, family offenses, custody and \nvisitation issues, paternity cases, and child support violations. \n391.  Although the state provides money to supplement district attorneys' salaries, it \ndoes not do so for the public defenders' salary.  These state funds account for a large percentage \nof the salaries of many Counties' district attorneys.  For example, in Schuyler, state funds \naccount for approximately half of the District Attorney's wages. \n392.  The Kaye Commission found that \"[p]rosecutors are consistently better funded \nand better staffed than indigent criminal defense service providers.  Their personnel, on average, \nhave higher salaries and greater ancillary resources than do their public defender counterparts.\" \n393.  In Schuyler County, the Chief Public Defender's salary in 2007 was $75,849, \nwhile the assistant public defender is paid $37,924.  The conflict defender was paid $2500 per \nmonth and must provide for his own malpractice insurance and training, as well as absorb all \noverhead expenses.  By contrast, the district attorney works in a fully supported office and makes \nmore than 50% more than the Chief Public Defender, earning $119,800. \n394.  In Washington County, the Chief Public Defender's salary in 2007 was $51,000, \nwhile the District Attorney was paid more than twice as much, earning $119,792.  Assistant \npublic defenders each earned $44,290, while assistant district attorneys earn up to $60,715.  In \n97 \n\naddition, the assistant public defenders must pay for their own malpractice and health insurance \nexpenses as well as overhead costs such as office space, support staff, legal research expenses, \ntransportation expenses, computers and office equipment and supplies.  Assistant district \nattorneys do not have to pay for these expenses and are provided with health care benefits. \n395.  According to the Spangenberg Group report, the Suffolk County Legal Aid \nSociety recently experienced a 16% turnover in staff, including the loss of experienced attorneys, \nbecause of low salaries. \n396.  Inadequate resources and staffing within institutional providers can directly \nimpact representation. As Spangenberg Group's report to the Kaye Commission noted, \"[tJhe \nneed to be efficient sometimes also results in an institutional provider turning a blind eye to \npotential conflicts of interest.\"  For example, in Schuyler County, a lack of resources for full \nstaffing means that the Public Defender's secretary administers the assigned counsel program \nand thus decides which lawyers will represent co-defendants of public defender office clients, \ncreating a systemic conflict of interest. \n397.  National and state standards for the provision of public defense services recognize \na public defense system must be designed to avoid conflicts of interest.  See ABA Standards for \nCriminal Justice, Defense Function (3d ed. 1993), Standard 4-3.5(c); NLADA Performance \nGuidelines for Criminal Defense Representation (1995), Guideline l.3(b); NYSDA, Standards \nfor Providing Constitutionally and Statutorily Mandated Legal Representation in New York State \n(2004), Standard VIII(A)(4). \nThe Effect of the Public Defense Crisis on Indigent Criminal Defendants \n98 \n\n398.  Hampered by the aforementioned systemic flaws, public defense counsel do not \nor are not able to perform even the most basic tasks necessary to provide meaningful and \neffective representation to their clients.  They do not act as an adversarial check on the \nprosecutor in criminal cases. \n399.  Indigent criminal defendants in New York therefore are experiencing or are at \nsevere and unacceptably high risk of experiencing: wrongful denial of representation; wrongful \nconviction of crimes; unnecessary or prolonged pre-trial detention; guilty pleas to inappropriate \ncharges; waiver of meritorious defenses; guilty pleas taken without adequate knowledge and \nawareness of the full, collateral consequences of the pleas; harsher sentences than the facts of the \ncase warrant and few alternatives to incarceration; and waiver of the right to appeal and other \npost-conviction rights.  Defendants are routinely not asked about their immigration status, for \nexample, notwithstanding that a plea which may result in no jail time may ultimately cause the \ndeportation of some immigrant defendants. \n400.  The history of inadequate representation in New York State has created a \npervasive public belief that representation by a public defender is grossly irrferior to \nrepresentation by a private attorney.  Public defender clients in Washington County routinely \nexpress their desire to hire a \"real lawyer\" or a lawyer who wasn't just \"a part of the system.\" \nSeveral clients reported a commonly held belief that public defenders work harder for their \npaying clients than for clients they represent as public defenders and that paying clients get more \nlenient plea bargains.  Similarly, in Schuyler County the chief public defender has resisted calls \nto move the public defender's office into a county building because it would exacerbate clients' \nperception that public defenders are not independent from the judicial and prosecutorial \nfunctions. \n99 \n\nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n401.  The plaintiffs bring this class action pursuant to Article 9 of the New York Civil \nPractice Law and Rules on behalf of all indigent persons who have or will have criminal felony, \nmisdemeanor, or lesser charges pending against them in New York state courts in Onondaga, \nOntario, Schuyler, Suffolk and Washington counties (hereinafter, \"the Counties\") who are \nentitled to rely on the govermnent of New York to provide them with meaningful and effective \ndefense counsel.  The Class includes all indigent persons against whom criminal charges will be \nbrought in the Counties during the pendency of this action. \n402.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical.  At any given \npoint in time, more than thousands ofpeopJe with criminal cases pending in New York State \ncourts in the Counties rely on public defense counsel for legal representation. \n403.  There are questions of law and fact common to the class that predominate over \nquestions affecting only individual members, including but not limited to: \n(1) whether the State has the responsibility under the Constitution of the State of New \nYork and the United States Constitution to provide meaningful and effective \nassistance of counsel to indigent criminal defendants; \n(2) whether in abdicating its responsibility to the counties, the State has failed to \nensure that indigent criminal defendants receive meaningful and effective \nassistance of counsel; \n(3) whether the State funds the public defense system in a manner that impedes the \ndelivery of meaningful and effective assistance of counsel; \n(4) whether the State's failure to oversee and set standards for the provision of public \ndefense services impedes the delivery of meaningful and effective assistance of \ncounsel; \n(5) whether the State's failure to adequately fund, supervise and administer the public \ndefense system in the counties violates the constitutional and statutory rights of \nthe plaintiff class. \n100 \n\n404.  The claims of the class representatives are typical of the claims of the class \nmembers and by pursuing their own interests the class representatives will advance the interests \nof the absent class members. Each of the class members is being denied or is at severe and \nunacceptably high risk of being denied constitutionally and legally adequate assistance of \ncounsel as a result ofthe defendants' failure to set standards for, oversee and fund public \ndefense. \n405.  The class representatives will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \nclass.  There are no conflicts of interest between the class representatives and the absent class \nmembers and the class representatives will vigorously prosecute this action on behalf of the \nclass. \n406.  A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy. \n407.  Defendants have consistently acted and refused to act in ways generally \napplicable to the class.  Thus, final declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to the class as a \nwhole is appropriate. \nOTHER ALLEGATIONS \n408.  Plaintiffs and the members of the class have suffered or are at imminent, severe \nand unacceptably high risk of suffering irreparable harm because of the Defendants' failure to \nremedy the financial and administrative deficiencies that plague the provision of pnblic defense. \nThere is no adequate remedy at law to address those deficiencies or the consequent deprivation \nof adequate and competent assistance of counsel. \nCLAIMS \n101 \n\nFirst Cause of Action \n(Violation of Article I, § 6 of the Constitution of the State of New York) \n409.

The Chief Judge's Commission on the Future of Indigent Defense Services \nA.  The Charge to the Commission  1 \nB.  The Commission and its Work  1 \nII.  The Right to Counsel in New York: An Ongoing Crisis  5 \nIII.  The Commission's Findings \nA.  New York's current fragmented system of county-operated and \nlargely county-financed indigent defense services fails to satisfy the \nstate's constitutional and statutory obligations to protect the rights \nof the indigent accused.  15 \n1.  There are no clear standards regarding eligibility determination \nand procedures.  15 \n2.  There is no statewide standard that defmes \"adequate\" indigent \ndefense and there exists no mechanism to enforce any particular \nset of standards.  16 \n3.  The amount of monies currently allocated within the State of \nNew York for the provision of constitutionally-mandated \nindigent defense is grossly inadequate.  17 \n(a) excessive caseloads  17 \n(b) inability to hire full-time defenders  18 \n(c)  lack of adequate support services  18 \n(d) lack of adequate training  18 \n(e) minimal client contact and investigation  19 \n4.  The current method of providing indigent defense services \ni \n\nin New York imposes a large unfunded mandate by the State \nupon its counties, results in a very uneven distribution of \nservices and compromises the independence of defense providers.  20 \n5.  In Town and Village Courts, in which a majority ofthe justices \npresiding are not lawyers, there is a widespread denial of the \nright to counsel and even a lack of clear understanding as to \nwhich cases trigger the right to counsel.  21 \n6.  There is a significant statewide disparity between the resources \navailable to public defenders and those enjoyed by prosecutors.  23 \n7.  The lack of more open discovery procedures and variations \nin discovery practices impedes the efficient expedition of cases, \ntimely investigation by the defense, including location of \nwitnesses, and gives rise to unfairness.  24 \n8.  Defense providers are not providing the requisite counseling \nwith regard to collateral issues that can affect critically a \ndefendant's case, especially those regarding a defendant's \nimmigration status.  Insofar as minorities are disproportionally \n. represented in the criminal justice system, this failure has \nparticular implications for individuals in those communities.  25 \n9.  There is no comprehensive system of data collection designed \nto provide accurate statistics regarding the provision of indigent \ncriminal defense services in New York.  The absence of such a \nsystem significantly hampers the ability of policy makers and \nadministrators to make informed judgments and plan meaningful \nimprovements in the administration of indigent defense services.  25 \n10.  The Commission's ultimate conclusion, based on all the \ninformation that has been presented to us, is that the delivery \nsystem most likely to guarantee quality representation to those \nentitled to it is a statewide defender system that is truly \nindependent, is entirely and adequately state-funded and is \none in which those providing indigent defense services are \nemployees of entities within the defender system or are participants \nin an assigned counsel plan that has been approved by the body \nestablished to administer the statewide defender system.  26 \nIII.  The Commission's Recommendations: \nA.  The delivery of indigent defense services in New York State should \nii \n\nbe restructured to insure accountability, enforceability of standards, and \nquality representation.  To this end there should be established a statewide \ndefender office consisting of an Indigent Defense Commission, a Chief \nDefender and Regional Defender and Local Defender Offices, a Deputy \nDefender for Appeals, and a Deputy Defender for Conflict Defense.  27 \n1.  The Indigent Defense Commission \na) Responsibility  27 \nb) Composition  28 \nc) Function  29 \n2.  The Chief Defender  30 \n3.  Regional and Local Defender Offices  30 \n4.  Appellate Representation  31 \n5.  Conflict Defense Representation  31 \nB.  The enactment of the Indigent Defense Commission Plan should \nbe followed by an expeditious phase-in schedule.  32 \nC.  Adequate funding of indigent criminal defense must be provided \nby the N ew York Legislature from the State's General Fund, not \nfrom the counties.  County funding should be phased out over \na three-year period.  32 \nD.  The system for funding indigent criminal defense services \nshould provide for elimination of the overall disparity between \nprosecution and defense resources so as to achieve \"adequate \nand balanced\" funding defense representation.  33 \nE.  A comprehensive date collection system designed to provide \nan accurate picture of the provision of indigent criminal defense \nservices in New York should be established and malntained. \nSuch a system would enable policy makers and administrators \nto make informed judgments concerning the administration of \nthe indigent defense system and plan for improvements.  33 \nIV.

Kaye, asked us to chair a commission on \nthe future of indigent criminal defense services, we understood her concern about the quality of \nrepresentation that indigent defendants were being afforded throughout the state.  But nntil the \nCommission was formed and pursued its mandate, we did not appreciate the depth of the problems \nwhich, over the past two years, the Commission has observed.  In the Commission's Interim Report, \ntransmitted to the Chief Judge on December 1, 2005, we reported on these problems and outlined a \nproposal for a fully state-funded statewide defender system that we determined was essential ifindigent \ndefendants in New York State were to be accorded their constitutional rights to quality representation. \nThis Final Report presents the Commission's factual fmdings in greater detail than previously, \nwith  the  added  benefit of having  the  extensive  report  of the  Commission's  consultant,  The \nSpangenberg Group, available to aid us in our determinations.  In this Final Report, we also present \nwith greater specificity, the statewide defender system that we believe is the only solution to the crisis \nin indigent defense representation in New York State.  In an Addendum, we also set forth a number \nof measures that can be implemented immediately to ameliorate certain discrete deficiencies that \nadversely affect the representation ofindigent defendants. \nWe are grateful to the witnesses who testified at the Commission's public hearings, to the \nindividuals who submitted written commentary to the Commission, and to the many organizations who \nshared with us the results of their work as it pertained to the issues surronnding indigent defense \nrepresentation.  These groups include bar associations, legal services providers, the NAACP Legal \nDefense & Education Fnnd, Inc., the American Civil Liberties Union, the New York State Defenders \nAssociation, the New York Civil Liberties Union, the New York State Association ofC  riminal Defense \nLawyers, the Association of Legal Aid Attorneys, the Northern Manhattan Coalition for Immigrant \nv \n\nRights, the Brennan Center for Justice, the League of Women Voters, the Prison Action Network, and \nPrison Families of New York.  We are also grateful to the hundreds of public officials, judges, and \ncourt personnel throughout the state who made themselves available to The Spangenberg Group in the \ncourse of its work.  We are also indebted to the Open Society Institute, the Center for Court \nInnovation, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, and the law :fmn of Davis, Polk \n& Wardwell for their fmancial assistance, which greatly facilitated the Commission's ability to retain \nThe Spangenberg Group as our consultant. \nWe also acknowledge our debt to the Commission's able counsels, Paul Lewis, John Amodeo, \nDavid  Markus,  and  Robert Mandelbaum,  whose  wisdom  and  energy  have  greatly  aided the \nCommission's endeavor. \nWilliam E. Hellerstein \nHan. Burton B. Roberts \nCo-Chairs of the Commission \n1.  The Chief Judge's Commission on the Future of Indigent Defense Services \n6 \n\nA.  The Charge to the Commission \nIn February 2004, in her State oft he Judiciary address, ChiefJudge Judith S. Kaye announced \nthe  formation  of the Commission.  The Commission's charge,  she  stated,  is to \"examine the \neffectiveness of indigent criminal defense services across the State, and consider alternative models \nof assigning, supervising and fmancing assigned counsel compatible with New York's constitutional \nand fIScal realities.\" Chief Judge Kaye stated further that \"under our current system created in 1965, \nwhich places the burden on local governments, a patchwork of indigent defense programs of varying \nsize and character has developed around the State.\" The Commission, therefore, understood that its \nmandate was to (l) examine the existing methods of funding indigent defense services; (2) evaluate \nthe effectiveness oft he various criminal defense provider plans throughout the state; and (3) assess the \nquality oft he representation afforded indigent criminal defendants, including the adequacy oft raining \nreceived by attorneys who deliver defense services, and the quantity and quality ofa ncillary resources, \nsuch as investigative and language interpretive services, afforded by and for defense providers. \nB.  The Commission and its Work \nThe Commission's fonnation was completed in May 2004.  Its 30 members come from each \nof New York State's 12 judicial districts and have extensive experience in the prosecution, defense, \naud adjudication of criminal cases; experience in the state's legislative and budget processes;  and \ninvolvement in court and criminal justice improvement organizations and  academic scholarship \nregarding criminal justice and indigent criminal defense systems.  The Commission's members also \nreflect the diverse political, social and ethnic diversity of the state. \nThe Commission held its organizational meeting in May 2004. It created four subcommittees \nto deal with (1) the current status of indigent defense in New York State; (2) the need for change; (3) \nproposals for change, and (4) financing mechanisms.  Subcommittee meetings took place between \nplenary sessions ofthe Commission. The Commission held four public hearings: New York City on \n1 \n\nFebruary 11,2005, Rochester on March 11,2005, Ithaca on March 23, 2005, and Albany on May 12, \n2005.  A total of 93 individuals testified at the hearings and others submitted written statements. \nThese individuals included public defenders, private criminal defense attorneys, assigned counsel plan \nadministrators, judges, prosecutors, experts in indigent defense, bar association representatives, \nmembers oft he civil rights community, representatives ofc ommunity groups, and defendants and their \nfamilies. A lisi oft he witnesses who testified is set forth in Appendix A. J \nThe Commission also requested the Office ofC  ourt Administration, through ChiefJudge Kaye \nand Chief Administrative. Judge Jonathan Lippman, to retain The Spangenberg Group (\"TSG\") to \nconduct a statewide study of New York's indigent defense system.  TSG  is a nationally and \ninternationally recognized criminal justice research and consulting firm that specializes in research \nconcerning indigent defense services. For over 15 years, it has been under contract with the American \nBar Association's Bar Information Program (ABA-BIP),  which provides support and technical \nassistance to individuals and organizations working to improve their jurisdiction's indigent defense \nsystem.  It has conducted empirical research in each of the 50 states and compiled comprehensive \nstatewide studies of the indigent defense systems in more than half the states. \nThe Spangenberg Group's report, which is set forth as Appendix B, is the most comprehensive \nstudy of indigent defense representation ever undertaken in New York State. It depicts the real crisis \nthat exists  in the provision of indigent defense services in New York City and throughout the state. \nThe seriousness of its  principal conclusions - that funding for indigent defense services is totally \ninadequate and that the system, as presently constituted, is dysfunctional - cannot be minimized. \nThe Spangenberg Report is based on two major components: data collection/analysis and on-\nsite assessment For the data collection and analysis, TSG collected information on cost, caseload, and \nI Transcripts of the testimony at the hearings are available on the Commission's website: \nhttp://www.courts.state.ny.us/ipJindigentdefense-commission/index.shtm!. \n2 \n\nsystem type for each of New York's 62 counties.  It conducted site work from September 2005 to \nMarch 2006, that involved visits to 22 counties, including the five counties comprising New York City, \nwhich were selected based upon factors such as judicial district, geography, and population.  TSG \nspoke ·with defense attorneys, judges and court personnel, as well as with state, county, and city \nofficials with knowledge ofthe criminal justice system. In addition to these interviews, TSG observed \ncriminal court sessions in many oft he counties in the stndy. It also attended each oft he Commission's \npublic hearings and reviewed the transcripts of testimony at each of the hearings. \nThe Commission delivered an Interim Report to Chief Judge Kaye on December J, 2005 in \nwhich the Commission described the long-term and continuing crisis in the delivery of indigent \ncriminal defense services in New York State2 and concluded, on the basis of previous stndies and \ntestimony at its four public hearings, that: \nthe  indigent defense  system  in New  York  State  is  both  severely  dysfunctional and \nstructurally  incapable  of providing  each  poor  defendant  with  the  effective  legal \nrepresentation that he or she is guaranteed by the Constitution ofth.e United States and the \nConstitution and laws of the State of New York.  In actuality, it is a misnomer to call it a \n\"system\" at all.  Rather, it is a composite of a multiplicity of modalities, all of which are \nsanctioned by the statntory framework which New York State adopted in 1965 when it \nenacted Article 18-B of the County Law.  Unfortnnately, this framework has resulted in a \ndisparate, inequitable, and ineffective system for securing constitntional guarantees to those \ntoo poor to obtain counsel of their own choosing.  (Interim Report at J 6) \nThe Commission also informed the Chief Judge that \"[a jgreement was virtnally nnanimous amongst \nthe witnesses that there is a pressing need for an independent indigent defense oversight entity that, at a \nminimum, promulgates and enforces standards of effective representation,\" and that the creation of\" a \nStatewide Defender Office is essential to both the independence of an indigent defense system and the ability \nto provide a consistently high level of representation to indigent defendants.\" (Interim Report at 24-25,30) \nThe Commission concluded that such a system must be entirely state-funded and it outlined the components \nTIle Interim Report can be found at http://www.conrts.stat~.ny.us/ip!indigentdefense­\n2 \ncommissionlindex.shtml. \n3 \n\nof such a system - that it should consist of an \"Indigent Defense Commission, a Chief Defender, and \nRegional Defender Offices with local defender offices within each region that are established where needed.\" \n(Interim Report at 36) However, the Commission postponed the detailing of such a structure until the \nCommission's Final Report. \nOn January 27, 2006, Chief Judge Kaye, in a speech to the New York State Bar Association, \npreviewed the Commission's recommendation for a state-funded, statewide indigent criminal defense system. \nThat same day, the ASsociation's House ofDeiegatesunanimouslY called for statewitle oversight ofw  hat it, \ntoo, portrayed as New York's \"existing, balkanized system.\"s  On February 6, 2006, Chief Judge Kaye \nreleased the Commission's Interim Report as part of her State of the Judiciary address. She stated that \"[t]he \nCommission has convincingly concluded that the existing system needs overhaul. .. ,\" and that she had \"not \nseen the word 'crisis' so often, or so uniformly, echoed by all of the sources, whether referring to the \nunavailability of counsel in Town and Village Courts, or the lack of uniform standards for detennining \neligibility, or the counties efforts to safeguard county dollars, or the disparity with prosecutors, or the lack \nof attorney-client contact, or the particular implications for communities of color.'\" \nSince  the  Commission  issued  its  Interim  Report,  the  factual  assessments  upon  which  the \nCommission's conclusions were based have been overwhehningly corroborated by TSG's factual fmdings. \nTSG's massive and comprehensive study provides a true understanding of the depth and scope of the crisis \nin the delivery of defense services to impoverished defendants in New York's criminal justice system. \nTherefore, we urge all who are concerned with this crisis to examine closely The Spangenberg Report. We \ndo so at a time in New York's history when there is a chorus ofvoices calling for extensive and meaningful \nchange in the delivery of indigent defense services in New York in order to effectuate the mandates of the \n3 John Caber, Kaye Says Panel Backs Funded Statewide Plan To Represent Indigents, New York \nLaw Journal, January 30, 2006, p.

The Right to Counsel in New York: An Ongoing Crisis \nIn 2006,  there remains little to debate about the substantive meaning of the right to counsel. \nAlthough it took much too long for the value of the right to counsel to be fully appreciated in American \njurisprudence,43 years have elapsed since the Supreme Court, in Gideon v. Wainwright,6 embraced fully the \nprinciple \"that lawyers in criminal courts are necessities, not luxuries\" because it is an \"obvious truth\" that \n\"any person haled into court, who is too poor to hire a lawyer, cannot be assured a fair trial unless counsel \nis provided for him;,,7 the Supreme Court also applied that  principle to an indigent defendant's ability to \ns \nappeal a conviction. Several years after Gideon,  the Court extended a poor person's right to counsel \"to \nany criminal trial, where an accused is deprived of his liberty\"· and, most recently, to cases in which a \n5 In addition to the action taken by the House of Delegates of the New York State Bar \nAssociation, the New York State Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers informed the Commission on \nApril 14, 2006 that in light oft he Connnission's recommendation that a statewide system of indigent \ndefense services should be established, it \"had convened a diverse working group of its members to think \nabout the best way for a statewide system to be implemented in New York State.\"  The Association's \nefforts have produced a draft bill that would create such a system; the bill mirrors many of the \nCommission's recommendations in its Interim Report and in tbis Report.  In addition, the Committee for \nan Independent Public Defense Commission, chaired by Michael S. Whiteman, has long been active in \nseeking the creation of a statewide defender system.  Among others who have spoken out in favor of such \na system are former Chief Judge Sol Wachtler, former Court of Appeals Judge and former Dean of st. \nJohn's Law School, Joseph Bellacosa, former Chief Administrative Judge Richard Bartlett, former Senate \nMajority Leader Warren M. Anderson, Norman L. Reimer, then President of the New York County \nLawyers' Association, Vincent E.

In New York, however, \nthe Criminal Procedure Law affords a more expansive right to counsel than federal law in that a defendant \nis entitled to counsel for any offense (except tra:fflcmfractlons) regardless of whether incarceration is \nauthorized upon conviction.!'  Additionally, the right to counsel provision of New York's Constitution, as \ninterpreted by the Court of Appeals has, in a number of contexts, afforded greater protections to criminal \ndefendants than does the federal constitution.\" \nThis Report then is not about the adequacy of substantive law concerning the right to counsel for \nindigent defendants. It concerns whether the law's mandate is being afforded to every defendant entitled to \nits enjoyment. Regrettably, although rights under the Constitution and laws are individual rights,14 it is clear \nthat, on a widespread basis, they are not honored as such in New York State. \nIn 1965, to meet constitutional mandates, New York enacted Article 18-B oft he County Law, which \nrequired each county and the City of New York to establish a plan for the provision of counsel to indigent \nAlabama v. Shelton, 535 U.S. 25 (2002). \n10 \nII McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.S. 759, 771 n4 (1970). \n12 See, CPL 180.10 (3)(c), CPL 170.10 (3), CPL 210.15 (2)(c).

A locality could create a public \n16 \ndefender office and appoint through its governing body an attorney to fill the position;17  it could opt to \ndesignate a legal aid society; 18 or it could adopt a plan of a bar association wherein the services of private \n19 \ncounsel would be provided on a rotational schedule which plan would be coordinated by an administrator.\nThe statute also allowed a county to adopt a combination of these options.:W  The law mandated that \"each \nplan ...p rovide for investigative, expert and other services necessary for an adequate defense.,,21  However, \nprivate assigned counsel compensatioti was set at $10 per hour for out-of-court work and$15 per hour for \nin-court time.  The dollar amounts for investigative and other auxiliary services was capped at $300.'2 \nThe deficiencies in the strncture created by Article 18-B became apparent almost at its ontset.  First \nand foremost was that Article 18-B did not include a mechanism to evaluate the quality of representation; \nit also placed the fmancial burden on counties and the City ofN  ew York. Other than requiring that a public \ndefender,  legal aid society, or assigned counsel administrator file  an annual report with the Judicial \nConference,  the statute contained no standards by which the quality of representation could be measured \n23 \nand enforced, nor did it establish a mechanism to ensure that there would not be serious disparities in the the \nquality of representation afforded indigent defendants  simply by  the  mere happenstance of geographic \nIS  County Law § 722. \n16  County Law § 722 (1). \n17  County Law § 716. \nCounty Law § 722 (2) \n18 \n19  County Law § 722. \n20  County Law § 722 (4). \nCounty Law § 722. \n21 \nzz  County Law § 722-c. \nCounty Law § 722-f. \n23 \n7 \n\nlocation. Although the framework created by Article 18-B was supported by bar associations and government \nofficials at the time, structurally it gave rise to  a fractured, balkanized system, and those who opposed it \nrecognized that it would place serious fmancial burdens on counties. \nBy January 1967, the New York State Bar Association already detected serious shortcomings in \nindigent defense representation in New York. In an Indigent Defense Seminar, held in conjunction with the \nIudicial Conference, the Association placed at the top of its agenda the following; the absence of standards \nfor ensuring quality representation, the lack ofg nidelines for determining an accused's eligibility for assigned \ncounsel and for ancillary services, such as investigators and experts,  the scope of representation, and the \nrepresentation of minors. \nBy  1981, the Legislature itself perceived that New York's system of indigent defense was in \ndifficulty and it funded the New York State Defenders Association to administer a Public Defense Backup \nCenter. The Association's mandate was to help defenders and their clients by assisting with cases, securing \nexperts, and providing training.  The Association was also asked to review, assess, and analyze the public \ndefense system, identifY problem areas and propose solutions in the form ofs pecific recommendations to the \nvarious branches of government.  Over the ensuing decade, the Association pnblished a series of reports in \nwhich the manifold shortcomings in New York's indigent defense system were described. \nWith regard to rates ofpay for assigned counsel, the Legislature in 1977 increased the rate for out-of \ncourt work from $10 to $15 per hour and from $15 to $25 per hour for in-court work. In 1986, the rates were \nincreased to $25 per hour for out-of-court work and $40 for in-court work and payment for all appellate work \nwas to be compensated at the in-court rate. \nIn the period from  1986 to 2003, bar associations and other interested organizations expressed \ngrowing concern about the lack of adequate funding for indigent defense representation and the quality of \nrepresentation that was being afforded.  In 1994, the New York County Lawyers Association raised serious \nquestions about the quality of representation being afforded to the indigent defendant and the impact of \n8 \n\ndecreased funding on defense providers. As a result, it established a Task Force on the Representation oft he \nIndigent.24  In June 1995, the Task Force urged the immediate creation of a Board of Trustees for Indigent \nDefense to oversee and secure the professional independence of defender organizations in New York City. \nIt recommended that the Board of Trustees be authorized to establish general policy for all individual and \ninstitutional counsel providing for the criminal defense of the indigent. \nIn October 1995, the Appellate Division, First Department, established the Indigent Defense \nOrganization Oversight Committee (\"r:b66C\") to monitor the operation of organizations that contract with \nthe City of New York to represent indigent defendants in criminal proceedings.2s  On Jnly 1, 1996, IDOOC \nissued its standards,  General Requirements for All Organized Providers of Defense Services to Indigent \nDefendants, which were adopted by the Appellate Division, First Department, as court rules.  IDOOC's \nmandate did not include the oversight of assigned counsel programs.  Nor was IDOOC authorized to alter \nthe funding of any defender organization not in compliance with its standards.  However, there is some \nevidence that IDOOC's standards and modest monitoring affected positively the qnality of representation by \ninstitutional providers but no body similar to IDOOC has been created elsewhere in the State.>6 \n24  Also in 1994, in New York City, then-Mayor Rudolph Giuliani reached an agreement with \nstate court officials to begin using, as a cost savings measure, fewer 18-B attorneys to represent indigent \ndefendants.  This placed a greater burden on the Legal Aid Society's ability to fulfill its contractual \nobligations with the city.  When the Association of Legal Aid Attorneys went on strike, Mayor Giuliani \nproposed to reduce the Society's funding by $16 million and issued a call for Requests for Proposals from \nnascent competing defense organizations to take over work of the Legal Aid Society at both the trial and \nappellate levels.  As a result of this process, New York County Defender Services, Queens Law \nAssociates, Brooklyn Defender Services, Bronx Defenders, the Center for Appellate Litigation, Appellate \nAdvocates, and the Richmond County law fInn of Battiste, Aronowsky & Suchow were allowed to \ncontract with the city for defense work. \n25  See, 22 NYCRR, Part 613.5. \n26  The only body with any similarity to IDOOC was the Oversight Committee for the Criminal \nDefense Organizations for the Appellate Division, Second Department, created in 1997.  The Committee \nwas formed in response to a request by the Mayor's Criminal Justice Coordinator for an evaluation ofthe \nperformance of the criminal defender groups created within the Second Department in 1996 by the City \nof New York. In February 1998, the Committee issued an evaluation of three new defender groups and \nfound them to provide quality representation.  However, neither the Legal Aid Society nor the 18-B \n9 \n\nIn February 1997, the Task Force of the New York Coun1y Lawyers Association announced that the \nrates ofc ompensation for assigned counsel were inadequate and \"inconsistent with New York's commitment \nto equal justice.\"  rn December 1997, the New York State Defenders Association called for state fmancial \nsupport ofa ssigned counsel plans as well as legal aid societies and public defender systems. In 1998, lDOOC \nissued a report concluding that, at its current funding level and caseload levels, the Legal Aid Socie1y ofN  ew \nYork was not meeting the standards lDOOC had established. Also, in 1998, the New York State Defenders \nAssociation held fact-finding  hearings throughout the state at which numerous wittiesses testified to \nwidespread inadequacies in the representation afforded iridigent defendants. \nIn June 1999, the Unified Court System expressed its own deep concern with the inadequacy of \nassigned counsel fees and Chief Judge Kaye proposed using $63 million of the state's share of surcharge \nmonies to offset the costs of a fee increase, a plan that was endorsed by bar leaders, the presiding justices of \nthe Appellate Division,  Attorney  General Elliot Spitzer, and the New York State District Attorneys \nAssociation. In September 1999, the Depu1y Chief Administrative Judge for Justice Initiatives, Juanita Bing \nNewton, convened a working group to find solutions to the fee crisis. \nIn January 2000, the Unified Court System  issued its report, Assigned Counsel Compensation in \nNew York: A GrOWing Crisis. Focusing exclusively on the low rates of compensation for assigned counsel, \nthe report  urged  not only that the rates for assigned counsel should be increased, but also that due to the \nconsiderable fiscal burdens imposed on local governments, the stete shouldshafe the cost ofa ssigned counsel \ncompensation. \nIn February 2000, the New York Coun1y Lawyers Association filed a lawsuit in Supreme Court, New \nYork Coun1y (New York County Lawyers Association v. New York State, et. al.) alleging that indigent adult \ndefendants and children in the First Department were being denied their constitutional rights to effective legal \nassistance.  In January 2001, Governor George Pataki announced the creation of a joint task force to study \nPanel, by far the largest defense providers in the ci1y were evaluated, and there is no indication that the \nCornmittee is currently operational \n10 \n\nthe compensation rates for law guardians and assigned counsel and come up with a proposal for legislation. \nIn March 2001, after holding hearings, the Appellate Division, First Department's  Committee on \nthe Legal Representation of the Poor issued a report entitled Crisis in the Legal Representation oft he Poor: \nRecommendations for a Revised Plan to Implement Mandated Funded Legal Representation ofP ersons Who \nCannot Afford Counsel.  The report stated that \"[t)he entire system by which poor people ll1'e provided legal \nrepresentation is in crisis.\" The report concluded that the crisis went well beyond the low rates for assigned \ncounseJand emphasized that the major causes of the crisis were the \"lack of resources, support and respeCt, \n[and) inadequate funding ofinstit],ltional providers combined with ever-increasing caseloads.\" The Committee \ncalled upon \"the New York State Legislature to reconsider the entire legislative structure relating to \ngovernmentally funded legal representation of the poor.\"  Also,  in March 2001, the New York State \nDefenders Association issuedareport, Resolving the Assigned Counsel Fee Crisis: An Opportunity to Provide \nCounty Fiscal Relief and Quality Public Defense Services.  The report called for the creation of an \nindependent and politically insulated statewide Public Defense Commission that would oversee both the \ndistribution of state funds and the provision of defense services. \nIn April 2001, The New York Times published a three-part series on New York City's indigent \ndefense system.  In an editorial, Drive-by Legal Defense, which commented on the series, The Times stated \nthat it portrayed a system in which \"underpaid, ill-prepared, virtually unsupervised private lawyers sometimes \nrepresent hundreds ofd efendants per year, leaving little time orincentive for them to master the facts, prepare \nand argue the cases or file appeals of dubious convictions.\"  \"There is a real question,\" said The Times, \n\"whether many defendants are getting the legal representation to which they are entitled, or are receiving \nmerely token representation to give their trials a veneer of constitutionality.\"  The Times observed further \nthat \"[e]ven the public and nonprofit institutions that defend many of the state's indigent defendants are so \nstarved for funds that they cannot do their best for clients.\"  The Times called \"for a strong state role -\npreferably through a politically insulated commission - in setting quality standards ... and in exercising \n11 \n\nvigorous oversight 10 make sure those standards are met\" \nIn July 2001, the Committee for an Independent Public Defense Commission was formed, chaired \nby Michael S. Whiteman, former counsel to Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller. The Committee declared that \nthe indigent defense system was on the verge of collapse and presented to the Governor and the Legislature \na bill to establish an independent oversight commission. \nIn May 2002, Senator Dale Volker and Assemblyman Martin Luster introduced bills that, in addition \nto raising assigned counsel rates and eliminatiUg caps on auxiliary defimse serVices, also provided for creation \nof an independent public defense commission to promulgate standards for representation and which would \nserve as a conduit for state financing of up to 40 percent of the cost oflocal defense systems. \nOn February 5, 2003, Supreme Court Justice Lucindo Suarez rendered his decision in the lawsuit \nbrought by the New York County Lawyers Association. He declared that the existing compensation rates for \nassigned counsel were unconstitutional becaUSe their inadequacy violated a defendant's constitutional and \nstatutory rights to meaningful and effective representation.  In describing the evidence bearing on the \nrepresentation oftlle indigent, Justice Suarez made the following fmdings: \nToo many assigned counsel do not:  conduct a prompt and thorough interview of the \ndefendant; consult with the defendant on a regular basis; examine the legal sufficiency oft he \ncomplaint or indiclulent; seek the defendant's prompt pretrial release; retain investigators, \nsocial workers or other experts where appropriate; file pretrial motions where appropriate; \nfully advise the defendant regarding any plea and only after conducting an investigation of \nthe law and the facts; prepare for trial and court appearances; and engage in appropriate \npresentence advocacy, including seeking to obtain the defendant's entry into any appropriate \ndiversionary program.\" \nIn  May 2003, the Legislature enacted legislation that increased the rates of compensation for \nassigned counse1.28  The main provisions of the law, which took effect on January 1, 2004, (a) increased \nassigned counsel fees to $60 per hour for misdemeanors (with a per case cap of $2,400) and $75 per hour for \n27  New York County Lawyers Association v. New York State, et af., 196 Misc.2d 761,774-75, \n763 N.Y.S. 2d 397, 403 (Sup. Ct N.Y. Co. 2003). \n28  S. 1406-B/A. 2106-B (Chapter 62 of the Laws of2D03). \n12 \n\nfelonies and all other eligible cases (with a per case cap of $4,400); (b) raised the caps on expert and \ninvestigative services to $1,000 per provider; (c) created a revenue stream for some state funding of defense \nservices from various fees, such as attorney registration fees and Office of Court Administration charges for \nvarious electronic database searches; (d) established an Indigent Legal Services Fund (\"ILSF\"), under the \njoint custody oft he Commissioner ofT  axation and the Comptroller, to distribute state funds based on the total \namount oflocal funds spent by localities on public defense statewide; and (e) created a ,task force to review \nthe sufficiency of assigned counsel rates which sunsets on June 30, 2006.29  However, under tiie 2003 \nlegislation, monies from the Indigent Legal Services Fund first go to reimburse the state for payment oflaw \nguardians. The remainder was to be distributed, begiuning only in 2005, to localities based on the percentage \nspent by a locality of the overall statewide total for public defense services. \nOn November 5, 2003, the Office ofJ ustice Initiatives in theOfflce of Court Administration brought \ntogether, at Pace Law SChool, criminal defense attorneys, prosecutors, judges, and other stakeholders in the \ncriminal justice system to examine the structure, method of fmancing, and the quality of representation \nprovided by New York's public defense system.  Experts from across New York State and elseWhere \nidentified a host of major problems in the system and a consensus was reached as to the components for a \nquality defense system. These are: (l) detailed statewide standards of practice for public defense providers; \n(2) the provision of meaningful training, supervision, and mentoring of attorneys; (3) parity in salary and \nresources between the prosecution and the defense; (4) ensuring defender independence; and (5) development \nof a client-centered ethos. \nIn 2004, the New York State Bar Association established the Special Committee to Ensure Quality \nof Mandated Representation.  The Special Committee was charged to study the issues that arose from the \nassigned counsel rate increase and the responses to that increase from the counties.  It was also charged to \n29  Although the task force was required to issue a report to the Governor and the Legislature on \nor before January 1S , 2006, the members oft he task force have not been appointed and it has never met. \n13 \n\nrecommend to the Association's Executive Committee steps that might be taken to ensure that mandated legal \nrepresentation would satisfy constitutional standards.  The Special Committee concluded that the most \neffective measure that the Association could take in the short term to ensure quality representation would be \nthe promulgatiou of standards for the provision of such representation.  In fulfillment of its mandate, the \nSpecial Committee produced an extensive set of standards noting, however, that it \"made no qualitative \nJudgments about the different provider systems allowed under [Article] 18_B.\"sO \nOn April 2, 2005, the New York State Bar Association's House of Delegates approved, with some \nmodifications, the set of standards that had been drafted by the Special Committee. The standards call for \n(1) a highly qualified and well-trained staff who are committed to the defense function; (2) an independent \nboard of directors that sets policy; (3) limitations on caseload and workload that its lawyers assume; (4) \nintensive training for each lawyer; (5) a strong support staff, including full-time professional investigators \nand other relevant personnel. The House of Delegates also recommended that these standards be adopted as \ncourt rules. \nIn October 2005, the Special Committee issued a follow-up report in which it recommended that the \nAssociation \"advocate for the creation of an independent public defense mechanism empowered to provide \noversight, quality assurance, support, and resources to providers ofm  andated representation and to advocate \nfor funding and reform when appropriate. As noted earlier, this recommendation also was approved by the \nAssociation's House ofDelegates.3! In April 2006, the New York State Association of Criminal Defense \nLawyers issued its proposed draft bill calling for a statewide indigent defense structure overseen by a Public \nDefense Commission. \nIII.  The Commission's Findings \nIn July 2004, the Chief Defenders of New York State also approved Standards for Providing \n30 \nConstitutionally and Statutorily Mandated Legal Representation in New York State.  These standards \nwere adopted by the Board of Directors of the New York State Defenders Association. \nSee n3 ante. \n31 \n14 \n\nBased upon the Commission's four public hearings, a review of the extensive documentation \nprovided to the  Commission  by witnesses  and other  parties, and  a careful  examination of TSG's \ncomprehensive and exhaustive report,  the Commission has concluded that there is, indeed, a crisis in the \ndelivery of defense services to the indigent throughout New York State and that the right to the effective \nassistance of counsel, guaranteed by both the federal and state constitntions, is not being provided to a large \nportion oft hose who are entitled to it.  In general terms, this failure is attributable to a lack of an independent \nstatewide oversight mechanism that can set standards and ensure accountability in the provision of indigent \ncriminal defense services and to a grievous lack of adequate funding by the state for those services. \nSpecifically, the Commission makes the following findings: \nA.  New York's current fragmented system of county-operated and largely county-financed \nindigent defense services fails to satisfY the state's constitutional and statutory obligations to protect \nthe rights ofthe indigent accused. \nThe system created in 1965 pursuant to Article 18-B of the County Law has,  in the words ofTSG, \nproduced \"a haphazard, patchwork composite of multiple plans that provides inequitable services across the \nstate to persons who are unable to afford counsel.  The multiple plans ... not only lack uniformity and \noversight, but often fail to comply with the requirements of the enabling statute.  The result is a fractured, \ninefficient and broken system.\" (SR at 155) There is virtual universal agreement that what is required is an \neffective statewide structure desigued to monitor and euforce compliance with existing norms and standards \nthat govern the representation of indigent defendants.  The fault lines in the system throughout New York \nState are numerous: \n1. There are no clear standards regarding eligibility determinations and procedures. \nAt the outset of a criminal proceeding, there must exist an effective method for determining whether \nthe accused is entitled to the assignment of counseL  However, TSG has found that guidelines for the \nappoin1ment of counsel exist only in a few counties and that even in those counties, the guidelines were not \nuniformly applied. Thus, a defendant may be deemed eligible for the appoin1ment of counsel in one county \n15 \n\nand ineligible in a neighboring county or even in a different court within the same county. Moreover, public \ndefenders and assigned counsel themselves are frequently charged with the responsibility for making initial \neligibility determinations. This responsibility not only adds unduly to their workloads but also raises serious \nethical issues.  Judges and court clerks also share in the responsibility for determining eligibility for \nassignment of counsel and must do so with limited or no standards to follow.  TSG observed further that \n\"[i]n the absence of uniform guidelines, subjective and sometimes disparate eligibility determinations are \nmade across the state, and  competing concerns such as  county  funding  and  workload may  become \ninappropriate factors in the determinations.\" (SR at 157) \n2. There is no statewide standard that defines \"adequate\" indigent defense and there exists \nno mechanism to enforce auy particular set of standards. \nDespite the existence ofv arious sets ofs tandards for representation that bar associations have issued \nover the years, there is no single set of standards that actually governs what \"adequate\" indigent defense \nservices means.  As TSG notes, \"[w]hile New York has three sets of standards that relate to attorney \nperformance and mandated legal representation, except for the general disciplinary rules of the professional \ncode, they are largely unenforceable.\" (SR at 21) At the hearings, the Commission learned of at least one \ncounty executive who considers  representation \"adequate\" if it avoids \"ineffective assistance of counsel\" \nclaims on appeal.  At least one public defender also thought this was the standard by which his office's \nrepresentation should be measured; because no conviction from his office had ever been reversed on grounds \nof ineffective assistance, he too concluded that no attorney in his office had ever been less than effective. \nAs we noted previously, the New York State Bar Association recently adopted Standards for \nProviding Mandated Representation. Although it is the Association's hope that its standards will be widely \naccepted as minimum standards and that they will have a positive effect on the quality of representation, the \nfact remalns that these standards, and those of other organizations that have adopted standards, are binding \non no one.  The consequence of having unenforced standards, as found by TSG, is that \"in some areas, \nsubstandard practice has become the acceptable nonn.\" (SR at 156) TSG has also noted  that New York's \n16 \n\nindigent defense system does not even confonn to the American Bar Association's Ten Principles ofaPublic \nDefense Delivery System, which are set forth in The Spangenberg Report's Appendix C. (SR at 155) \n3.  The amount of monies currently allocated within the State of New York for the provision \nof constitutionally-mandated indigent criminal defense is grossly inadeqnate. \nTSG has detennined that ''New York's indigent defense system is in a serious state of crisis and \nsuffers from an acute and chronic lack of funding.\" (SR at 155) At an average cost-per-capita of $18.54,32 \nNew York ranks substantially lower in payment per defendant  than a number of states. (SR at 29)  Such \nunder-funding has a deleterious impact on all aspects of indigent defense representation. Testimony \nat the Commission's hearings was replete with descriptions by defenders of their inability to provide \neffective representation due to a lack of resources. This lack ofr esources (a) results in excessive caseloads; \n(b) impedes the ability of many institutional providers to hire full-time defenders; (c) deprives defense \nproviders of adequate access to investigators, social workers, interpreters and other support services; (d) is \nlargely responsible for inadequate or non-existent training programs; and (e) contributes to defense providers \nhaving only minimal contact with clients and their families: \n(a) excessive caseloads \nAt the Commission's four public hearings, virtually aJl institutional defenders testified to having to \nlabor under excessive case loads.  TSG observes that \"[g]iven the funding problems and the need to show \nefficiency, it is not surprising that institutional providers throughout the state are burdened with heavy \ncaseloads.\" (SR at 43)  A chilling example of this distressful fact came from the Monroe County Public \nDefender, one oft he state's most highly regarded public defenders, who described in detail the overwhelming \ncaseloads under which his office labors. (SRat 45)  There was also much evidence presented atthe hearings \nthat public defenders or other institutional providers do not have adequate staff to cover aU Town and Village \nCourts in a given jurisdiction and that requests for additional funds to keep pace with ever growing caseloads \nTSG computes cost-per-capita by dividing the total statewide indigent defense expenditure by \n32 \nNew York State's popUlation. \n17 \n\nare, for the most part, not granted.  In one county, for example, despite average misdemeanor caseloads of \n1,000 cases per attorney and 175 felony cases per attorney per year, the chief public defender annually is \nrequired to submit to the county a proposal as to how he would operate his office with a 10 to 12 percent \nbudget cut. \n(b) inability to hire full-time defenders \nSignificant numbers of public defenders testified that they could only be funded by their respective \ncounties to work part-time.  As TSG deterinilled \"[t]he burden of heavy caseloads is exacerbated in some \ncounties by the lise of part-time attorney positions\" and that \"in some counties the part-time attorneys ... are \nexpected to handle 'full-time caseloads. (SR at 46) \n(c) lack of adequate support services \nMany institutional providers testified to their lack ofa ccess to investigators, social workers, foreign \nlanguage interpreters, and other support services. TSG reports that \"[\\j hroughout our site work in New York, \nin all parts of the state, we were struck by the inadequate provision of and lack of requests for expert and \ninvestigative services.\" (SR at 72) In some defender office's, the attorneys conduct their own investigations, \nas best they can.  A number of defenders testified  that they even lacked sufficient funds for basic office \nsupplies. \n(d) lack of adequate training \nThere exist wide disparities in the training of indigent defense counsel.  We learned that very few \ninstitutional providers have ill place viable training programs and that access to training is inconsistent across \nthe state. In regard to assigued counsel and contract defense programs, training ranges from non-existent to \nthe barely adequate.  While the New York State Defenders Association has training programs, they are not \nalways easily accessible by overworked defenders.  In some counties, institutional defense providers have \nno funds to provide training or even to send their attorneys to defender training programs and CLE programs. \nAs noted by TSG, \"other than Disciplinary Rule 6-10  (which forbids a lawyer from handling a matter which \n18 \n\nthe lawyer knows or should know that he or she is not competent to handle) public defenders and legal aid \nlawyers in many New York counties are subject to few mandatory standards of practice, inadequate training, \nand little or no oversight.\" (SR at 51) \n(e) minimal client contact and investigation \nExtensive hearing testimony also presented a distressing picture of minimal attorney-client contact. \nWe were told ofa ttorneys who did not visit their clients injail, return phone calls, answer letters, or conduct \neven minimal investigations oft heir clients' cases. In some counties, the only attorney-client contact available \nis through collect calls to counsel, which many colinsel refuse to accept. In a number of counties, attorney-\nclient contact occurs only when the defendant is broughtto court for a scheduled appearance. Although some \njudges indicated that they will grant an attorney's request ilmt the defendant be brought to the courthouse for \na meeting in between court appearances, there was no indication that this is a common request or that courts \ncommonly grant such requests.  Especially disturbing was the testimony from former prisoners and from \nfamilies of defendants as to the lack of contact with counsel, creating the perception, and most likely the \nreality, ofa lack of attention to a defendant's case. As TSG learned from its site visits, \"it is not uncommon \nfor indigent defense attorneys across New York State to meet a client for the first time on the day of court. \nThus, attorney-client contact frequently occurs in court where the attorney's time is short and there is often \nno setting for meaningful, confidential communications.\" (SR at 67) \nRecognizing that the above-described deficiencies are so clearly linked to inadequate funding, the \nCommission embraces TSG's conclusion that \"no structural changes in the indigent defense system can be \nimplemented, no mandatory and enforceable standards established, 110 statewide training developed and 110 \nsubstantial efforts undertaken to meet the state and federal counsel requirements, without a substantial \ninfusion of additional funds to the state's indigent defense system.\" (SR at 155) \n4.  The current method of providing indigent defense services in New York imposes a large \nunfunded mandate by the state npon its connties, results in a very uneven distribution ofservices and \ncompromises the independence of defense providers. \n19 \n\nAccording to TSG, the counties provided 80 percent ($280,588,598) oft he overall indigent defense \nfunding in New York in fiscal year 2004. (SR at 27) TSG points out, however, that although the state \nprovided 20 percent ($71,220,582) of all funding for indigent defense, 72 percent, or $51,551,71 0 \nfrom the new ILSF fund distributed to the counties, was provided through alternative revenue \nsources.  In fact, the data shows that only slightly more than 6 percent of the total state and local \nexpenditures for indigent defense services was attributable to the state general fund appropriation \nfor fiscal year 2004.  (SR at 27 ) \n33 \nIn light of the fiscal burdens on the counties, it was not surprising that witnesses at the hearings \nspoke of experiences that made  it clear that the funding  structure compromised both the quality of \nrepresentation and the very independence oft he defense function. One institutional provider told ofa County \nExecutive's admonition to judges that they were \"gatekeepers\" ofc ounty funds.  Another spoke ofa County \nExecutive's demands that, as part ofh is office's contract with the county, it waive certain of its clients' rights. \nAnother stated that he had been reprimanded by his County Executive for spending money on an expert \nwitness rather than relying on the prosecution's expert.  As TSG found, \"New York fails to ensure the \nindependence of its indigent defense providers who are too often subject to undue interference from tile \ncounties that fund them.  While County Law §7 22 requires the counties to provide indigent defense services \n'necessary for an adequate defense,' this requirement is largely open to interpretation by the counties that are \ndriven by competing fiscal (and sometinles) political concerns.\" (SR at 155-156) \n33  Though the Commission was not charged with studying Family Court mandated \nrepresentation, the crinlinal defense programs studied by TSG were, in many instances, inseparable from \nthe programs providing Family Court representation. As TSG observed, \"[f]amily court matters are an \nintegral part of New York's indigent defense system and cannot be completely removed from an overalll \nconsideration of the current system.\" (SR at 158) Indeed, these programs are frequently jointly \nadministered and completely interdependent and reported county level fiscal data is usually merged into \none amount covering both programs. Ibid.  These factors suggest that the Indigent Defense Commission \nthat we propose also oversee services providing for Family Court representation.  However, given the \nlinlitations of the Commission's mandate, we are hesitant to make this a specific recommendation. \n20 \n\nIronically and unfortunately, the 2003 increase in assigned counsel rates actually had a negative \nimpact on indigent defense representation.  As TSG found,  the increase caused many counties, as well as \nNew York City, to \"focus on the efficiency and cost-saving efforts oftheir providers,\" and that \"[a] numher \nof counties created a conflict office or shifted additional workload to institutional providers in an effort to \ncontrol rising costs, often without sufficient additional resources.\" (SR at 156) \nThe Sixth Amendment  and Article I, § 6, of the New York Constitution impose the obligation to \nprovide effective assistance of counsel for all indigents accused of crime on the State of New York, not on \ncounties or the legal profession.  The state also must gnarantee that the criminal defense function is truly \nindependent. This means that defense counsel must have responsibility for case-by -case administration while \nleaving to judges their inherent right and obligation to ensure that courtroom proceedings comply with the \nmandates imposed by the law and the rules of professional responsibility.  Therefore,  defense counsel, as \nwell as judges, also must be independent from the executive function at the local level, whose concerns with \ncounty-wide fiscal obligations have been shown to intrude on the defense function. \n5.  In Town and Village Courts, in which a majority of the justices presiding are not lawyers, \nthere is a widespread denial of the right to counsel and even a lack of clear understanding as to which \ncases trigger the right to counsel. \nThe position occupied by Town and Village Courts in the administration of justice cannot be \noverstated.  They handle the largest number of cases in the state's criminal court system and the fines they \nimpose contribute greatly to state and local government coffers. However, the absence ofa statewide defense \noversight structure has  had an especially devastating effect on the thousands  of indigent defendants \nprosecuted in the Town and Village Courts throughout the state.  In fact, the Conunission was alarmed, not \nonly by the vast disparity in these courts with respect to when the assignment of counsel is made, but also by \nthe numerous outright denials of the right to assigned counsel itself. \nThere are 1,281 Town and Village Courts outside of New York City with 2,154 Town and Village \njustice positions, the majority of which are filled by non-lawyers. Like City Courts, Town and Village Courts \n21 \n\nare \"local criminal courts\" and have trial jurisdiction over misdemeanors, violations and traffic infractions. \nThey also have preliminary jurisdiction over felonies committed in any town located in a county where such \nTown or Village Court is situated.  The Commission learned from witnesses at the Commission's hearings \nand from other sources that the deprivation ofi ndigent defendants' right to counsel was widespread in Town \nand Village Courts. Specifically, we learned that there are significant delays in the appointment of counsel, \nthat many indigent defendants must negotiate pleas with the prosecution while unrepresented, and that many \njustices themselves lack a clear understanding as to which cases trigger the right to counsel. The Commission \nalso learned that all too often counsel for indigent defendants are not available to attend the numerous Town \nand Village Courts. \nTSG's extensive findings with respect to proceedings in the Town and Village Courts are extremely \nserious. Among the most distressing are: (1) the lack of legal training, enforceable standards and oversight \nwhich \"create a risk to the quality ofj ustice rendered:\" (2) that \"[0 ]ften lacking sufficient legal knowledge \nand confidence, some justices are averse to trials and defense motions, seek advice from local prosecutors \nbefore  making  decisions,  make  subjective  rather  than  legally-objective  decisions,  and/or  lose  their \nindependence by succumbing to local govemmentpressure to gnard its funds,\" and frequently \"set excessive \nbail in many minor cases.\" (SR at 161) TSG found that \"[m]any indigent defendants in the town and village \ncourts across the state are deprived oft heir state and federal right to effective assistance of counsel. Counsel \nis either not present, not assigned in a timely marmer, or not assigned at all.\" (SR at 161) \nTSG observed further that \"[b )ecause town and village courts are not required to be courts ofr ecord, \nit is often difficult or impossible for a defendant to adequately exercise the right to appeal a decision by a \nlocal justice,\" and that \"li)n addition to lacking a record, some town and village courts are not held in a public \nplace and fail to ensure fujI public access and open procedures.\" (SR 161)  Thus, TSG concluded that it is \nnot \"currently possible to receive adequate and meaningful representation in many of the town and village \ncourts in New York State,\" and that \"major reform is needed to remove the numerous barriers to justice in \n22 \n\nthe locally-funded town and village court system.\" (SR 161-162) The widespread abrogation oft he rightto \ncounsel for the indigent defendant  these courts is simply unacceptable.34 \nill \n6. There is a significant statewide dispaniy between the resources available to public defenders \nand those enjoyed by prosecutors. \nProsecutors are consistently better funded and better staffed than indigent criminal defense service \nproviders.  Their personnel, on average, have higher salaries and greater ancillary resources than do their \npublic defender counterparts. Moreover, the disparity is uot just apparent in funding, salaries, and the number \noffull-time employees but in additional in-kind resources available only to prosecutors. This includes access \nto all law enforcement agencies in the county, as well as the New York State Division of Criminal Justice \nServices, the FBI and the state crime laboratory. In addition, prosecutors often receive federal and state grant \nassistance that defenders do not.  For example, the creation of new drug and other specialty courts (as of \nSeptember 8, 2005, 218 courts were operational with atleast 55 more planned) often comes with additional \nfederal grants for prosecutors and courts but not for defense providers. Nonetheless, institutional providers \nin particular are expected to staff many more parts, and make many more court appearances, with \n110 \nadditional resources. These disparities are well-documented in The Spangenberg Report. (SR at 83c863 The \nReport also calls attention to the Americau Bar Association's position,  that \"the appropriate measure of \nWhen the Commission began its work, it did not anticipate discovering the vast range of \n34 \nshortcomings and abuses that abound in the Town and Village Courts throughout the state.  Although the \nCOmmission believes its proposed statewide defender system can improve considerably the ability to \nprovide representation to indigent defendants in those courts, we would be remiss ifw  e did not call \nattention to the defects in the Town and Village Court system that we encountered in the course of our \nwork.  In our judgment, the abuses are so serious in the Town and Village Courts that they should be \nexamined by a body with specific authorization to scrutinize the manner in which those courts function. \nIn this regard, we note that ChiefJudge Kaye has created a Special Commission on the Futore of the New \nYork State Courts and has stated that the Special Commission \"will be asked to look at systems across the \nnation for ideas, and to propose a court structure that is free of barriers that force the unnecessary \nfragmentation of courts and cases, that is user-friendly, has the benefits of both specialization and \nsimplicity and that is accessible to all New Yorkers; and to suggest procedures that complement such a \nstreamlined system.\" Judith S. Kaye, The State oft he Judiciary 24 (2006).  An evaluation of the Town \nand Village Court system would seem appropriate to the work of a body such as the Special Commission. \n23 \n\nhealth with a criminal justice system is whether each agency in the system - courts, prosecution, defender \n-receives adequate and balanced resources.\" (SRat 83) \"Applying this measure ofs uccess,\" TSG conclndes, \n\"New York's system is failing.\" (SR at 83) \n7. The lack of more open discovery procedures and variations in discovery practices impedes \nthe efficient expediticm ofc ases, timely investigation by the defense, including location ofw  itnesses, and \ngives rise to unfairness. \nThe  Commission heard considerable testimony  regarding pretrial discovery  practices  among \nprosecutors' offices throughoutthe state. A major grievance of defense providers is that prosecntors refuse \nto disclose discovery materials until hours or even minutes before trial. It also is apparent that these practices \nvary among prosecutors' offices. Some prosecntors afford the defense more liberal discovery than is required \nby the cnrrent provisions of CPL Article 240.  Most choose to afford only what is minimally reqnired, and \nindividual prosecutors at times do not do even that - as the plethora of discovery issnes in criminal appeals \nand  collateral attack cases evidences.  Efforts to liberalize New York's discovery laws have gone on for \nyears,\" and it not within the Commission's mandate to enter this debate.  However, in the course of our \ninvestigation, we conld not ignore the obvious built-in inefficiency in existing discovery procedures and \npractices that causes delay and inhibits the efficient disposition of cases.  Nor can we ignore TSG's \nobservation, which is well within the Commission's mandate, that \"[t]he problems facing New York's \nindigent defense providers - inclnding inadeqnate resources, insufficient client contact, and a failnre to \nreqnest or receive investigative and expert services - are made more troubling by discovery practices and \nother prosecutorial policies with which they are faced.\" (SR at 77) \n8. Defense providers are not providing the requisite counseling with regard to collateral issues \nthat can affect critically a defendant's case, especially those regarding a defendant's immigration \nstatns.  Insofar as minorities are disproportionally represented in the criminal justice system, this \nfailure has particnlar implications for individuals in those communities. \nNnmerous witnesses atthe Commission's hearings emphasized the importance of defense providers' \nSee e.g., 2006 Report to the Chief Administrative Jndge by the Advisory Committee on \n35 \nCriminal Law and Procedure at 4. \n24 \n\nawareness of and abili!y to deal with a host of issues that disproportionately impact minorities.  First and \nforemost is the relationship between the changing ethnic composition ofthe minority population and current \ngovernment policies and practices with respect to immigration.  This has greatly increased the need for \ndefense attorneys to be cognizant oft he immigration status of clients and to be able to render advice as to the \npossible effect on that status when assessing options that may be available to clients.  This is especially \ncritical with regard to a defendant's informed decision when entering a guilty plea to a misdemeanor or a \nviolation.  As Rnssell Neufeld, the former Chief of the New York Legal Aid Society's Criminai Defense \nDivision, told the Commission: \nThe collateral conseqnences ofc riminal convictions has [sic] grown rapidly. So the balance \nhas shifted from the primary harm to a client aimost always being the amount of prison time \nhe or she is facing, to the collateral consequences of a conviction.  These include a myriad \nof penalties such as deportation, an entire family's loss ofpubJic housing, expulsion from \nschool, ineligibility for student loans and the disclosure to prospective employers of even \nviolation convictions.  Of these, deportation has increased to epidemic proportions. (SR at \n145) \nOther factors germane to informed representation inclnde awareness of a defendant's employment history, \nhousing status, overall family situation and the availability of diversionary programs.  Regrettably, the vast \nmajority of defendants do not experience such essential representation. \n9. There is no comprehensive system of data collection designed to provide accurate statistics \nregarding the prOVision of indigent criminal defense services in New York.  The absence of such a \nsystem significantly hampers the ability of policy makers and administrators to make informed \njudgments and plan meaningful improvements in the administration ofindigent defense services. \nThe Spangenberg Report details the serious shortcomings in New York State's data collection system \nin regard to  indigent defense.  It emphasizes that \"[w]hiIe there are a number of sources regarding \nappointment of indigent defense counsel, there is no single source for reliable information.  In spite of the \nexistence of very advanced and interconnected criminal justice data systems throughout the state, gathering \ndetailed and reliable information for criminal and family court appointments to indigent defense providers \nis virtually impossible.\" (SR at 34) Even under the new Indigent Legal Services Fund legislation that raised \ncompensation rates for indigent defense, the reports required of defense providers were often \"prepared \n25 \n\ninconsistently, incompletely, or not at all.\" (SR at 32-33)  In this advanced technological age,  such \ndeficiencies are unnecessary and preventable and therefore unacceptable. \n10.  The Commission's ultimate conclnsion, based on all the information that has been \npresented to us,  is that the delivery system most likely to guarantee quality representation to those \nentitled to it is a statewide defender system that is trnly independent, is entirely and adequately state \nfunded, and is one in which those providing indigent defense services are employees of entities within \nthe defender system or are participants in an assigned counsel plan that has been approved by the body \nestablished to administer the statewide defender system. \nAs we have pointed out, New York's current futiding of defense services is grossly inadequate in \nterms oft otal dollars and inrequiring that counties bear the brunt oft he costs for defense services, the funding \nstructure has created substantial disparities among the various counties in the type ofr epresentation afforded \nindigent defendants; in m811Y instances, it has seriously compromised the independence ofd efense providers. \nIt is also significant that New York is out ofs tep with the national trend that recognizes that full state funding \nis the preferable choice. As ofO  ctober 1, 2005, 28 states fund their indigent defense system entirely through \nstate funds.36 Recent funding data that TSG has reviewed shows that 19 of25 states that provide the highest \nper capita spending for indigent defense are also 10 0 percent state-funded. \nThere is also a clear trend among the states to develop statewide oversight mechanisms for indigent \ncriminal defense. Twenty-eight states place the responsibility and oversight oft heir state and local indigent \ndefense programs within a state counnission or a statewide public defender.37  In many states, both those with \n36  Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Iowa, Malne, Maryland, . \nMassachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North \nCarolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, \nand Wyoming.  See, Indigent Defense Costs Per Capita, A State by State Comparison, prepared by The \nSpangenberg Group for the ABA Bar Information Program, July 1,2005. \nAlaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawali, Iowa, Kansas, \n37 \nKentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New \nMexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklalloma, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, West \nVirginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.  Tennessee and Florida have statewide systems involving elected \npublic defenders.  Several of the remaining states have a commission with linlited state oversight and \nresponsibility.  See Statewide Indigent Defense Systems, prepared by The Spangenberg Group for the \nABA Bar Information Program, October 2005. \n26 \n\na statewide public defender program and those without, such oversight is provided exclusively through a state \ncommission or oversight board.  The oversight board is typically charged with setting policy for indigent \ndefense services and advocating for state resources. In 25 states, there is total state oversight and 100 percent \nstate funding.  In several states, the commission provides some statewide oversight, but lacks full authority \nover indigent defense services.  In other states, the oversight is provided' by the chief public defender and \nthere is no commission. New York is one ofo nly six states that have no statewide responsibility or oversight \nmechanism for indigent criminal defense.'\" \nIII. The Commission's Recommendations:39 \nA. The delivery of indigent defense services in New York State should be restructured \nto insure accountability, enforceability of standards, and quality of representation. To this end \nthere should be established a statewide defender office consisting of an Indigent Defense \nCommission, a Chief Defender and Regional Defender and Local Defender Offices, a Deputy \nDefender for Appeals, and a Deputy Defender for Conflict Defense. \n1.  The Indigent Defense Commission \na) Responsibility \nThe Indigent Defense Commission should have the responsibility for ensuring that quality \nlegal representation is provided on a consistent basis throughout the state, independent ofp arochial or private \ninterests. To achieve this end, the Commission should organize, supervise, and assume overall responsibility \nfor the  operation of New York's indigent defense system and pursue adequate funding necessary to \naccomplish these goals. \nb) Composition \n1.  The Commission should be comprised of no fewer than nine nor more than 13 \n38  The other states are Arizona, Maine, Pennsylvania, South Dakota and Washington. \nAs noted earlier, the Commission concluded that there are a number of interim measures that \n39 \nthe Unified Court System can take immediately to ameliorate a number of deficiencies that adversely \naffect the representation of indigent defendants; these measures are set forth in the Addendum. \n27 \n\nmembers appointed by the Governor, the Chief Judge, and the leaders oft he State Legislature, with none of \nthe three branches appointing a majority of its members. The selection should be made after solicitation of \ncandidates for appointment from bar associations, individuals, and conuuunity, civic and other groups. \n2. Conuuission members should reflect the geographic and ethnic diversity ofthe \nstate and should be individuals who have a variety of backgrounds, experiences, and qualifications. They \nshould also be individuals with significant experience in the provision ofr epresentation in criminal cases, or \nwho have demonstrated a conuuitment to the provision ofh igh quality representation ofc riminal defendants, \nor who have served people of low income in other contexts. An essential qualification for all candidates \nshould be a finn commitment to the principle of independence of the defense function.  However, no \nindividual who is a public defender, prosecutor, judge, law enforcement officer, or a member or employee \nofa  branch ofg overnment or ofa govemment agency, should be eligible for appointment to the Commission. \nAt least (wo-thirds of the Conuuission's members should be attomeys. \n3.  The teun of office for a member of the Conuuission should be four years. \nHowever, initially, the tenos of office should be staggered to ensure continuity of the Conuuission.  The \nCommission's chairperson should be chosen by majority vote of the Conuuission's membership. The \nCommission's members should not be compensated for their work except for reimbursement of actual and \nnecessary reasonable expenses in connection with their duties as members oft he Commission. For budgetary \npurposes only, the Commission sbould be boused in the judicial branch.  In all other respects, it must be \nindependent of all govenuuental inflnence. \nc) Function \nThe Indigent Defense Conuuission should have broad powers and responsibilities for the \ndelivery of quality indigent defense services.  It should: (1) hire a Chief Defender who should also serve as \nchief of the Conuuission's staff; (2) deteunine the location of Regional Defender Offices and local defender \noffices  within  each  regiou  as  are  needed;  (3)  hire  Regional,  Depnty,  and  local  defenders  upon \n28 \n\nrecommendation oft he Chief Defender and hire the Conflict Defender; (4) together with the Chief Defender, \nestablish and  implement standards for  performance,  hiring,  training and  continuing legal education, \npermissible caseloads, support services, determination of financial eligibility, and any other standards that \nare required to supervise and monitor the delivery of defense services; (5) together with the Chief Defender, \nevaluate existing indigent defense programs and determine the type of indigent defense services that should \nbe provided within each region which best serves the interests of indigent defendants in the region including \nbut not limited to, regional defender offices, contract institutional defenders and assigned counsel plans; (6) \nbe authorized to enter into contracts with institutional defense providers and assigned counsel plans that \nprovide representation that meet the standards established by the Commission; (7) set compensation standards \ndesigned to ensure adequate and balanced funding for attorneys providing indigent defense services, including \nattorneys employed by regional and local defender offices, contract legal defense providers, and assigned \ncounsel; (8) develop standards for hourly rates to be paid to assigned counsel, expert witnesses, investigators \nand interpreters and update those standards periodically. \n111e Commission should also: (9) determine the types ofinformation required for the auditing \nand monitoring of the performance of the indigent criminal defense function and establish an appropriate \nmechanism for the collection and publication ofs uch data; (10) establish auditing procedures in connection \nwith the handling ofpubJic funds; (11) be authorized to receive grants and contributions for the conduct of \nspecial projects that will enhance further the delivery of indigent defense services; (12) in conjunction with \nthe Chief Defender, make annual recormnendations to the Chief Judge, Governor and the Legislature to \nimprove the administration of the criminal justice system and the statewide indigent defense system. \n2. The Chief Defender \na)  The Chief Defender should be chosen by the Commission on the basis of his or her \ntraining, experience, and other qualifications as the Commission deems appropriate.  Prior to making the \nappointment,  the  Commission  should  solicit recommendations  from  bar associations  and  interested \n29 \n\ncommunity groups and individuals. \nb) The Chief Defender should serve as chief oft he Commission's staff' and should have the \nauthority, in consultation with the Commissiou, to hire attorneys as Regional and Deputy Defenders and such \nother staff' as the Chief Defender and the Commission deem necessary to effectuate the purposes of the \n(cstatewide defender system and to hire appropriate staff for his or her own office. \ne) The Chief Defender should assist the Commission with the promulgation of standards for \nperformance of the indigent defense function and ensure that those standards are monitored and enforced in \nall regional and local defender offices. \nd) The Chief Defender should insure that all regional and local defender offices are provided \nwith adequate support services. \ne)  The Chief Defender should evaluate existing defender service programs and make \nrecommendations to the Commission with respect to their continued existence. \nf) The Chief Defender should create a statewide database of available experts, investigators, \nand interpreters by region. \ng) The Chief Defender, in consultation with the Commission, should prepare the annual \nbudget. \n3. Regional and Local Defender Offiees \na) A Regional Defender Office in each geographic region as determined by the Commission \nshould be established, headed by a Regional Defender. The Regional Defenders should be hired by the \nCommission upon recommendation of the Chief Defender. \nb) Within each region,  local defender offices should be established as needed.  The \ndetermination as to the location ofs uch local offices should be made by the Commission, in consultation with \nthe Chief Defender and the Regional Defender for the region.  Each regional and local office should be \nsituated to ensure that attorneys and support staff' have maximum access to clients and their families, \n30 \n\ncourthouses, and detention facilities. \nc)  The Chief Defender and Regional Defender should consult with interested community \ngroups and individuals in each region regarding matters affecting the delivery of indigent defense services \nin the region. \n4.  Appellate Representation \na) The ChiefDefender should hire and supervise a Deputy Defender for Appeals who should \ndevelop a plan for the representation ofindigent defendants who wish to appeal their convictions or respond \nto appeals by the prosecution.  Such a plan should include standards for the detennination of whether \nrepresentation of an indigent client should continue beyond the direct appeal from the client's judgment of \nconviction. \nb) The, Deputy Defender for Appeals should monitor all appellate assignments, ensure that \nthe assigrunent of cases is made promptly, that the record on appeal is obtained expeditiously and that all \nappellate service providers comply with the standards for perfonnance established by the Commission. \nc)  The Deputy Defender for Appeals should maintain complete and accurate records of \nappellate and post-conviction services and expenses. \n5.  Conflict Defense Representation \na) There should be a Defender for Conflicts who is appointed and supervised directly by the \nCommission and is totally independent of the Chief Defender. \nb) The Defender for Conflicts should be responsible for developing a plan for providing \nconflict counsel in criminal cases both at trial and on appeal.  Such a plan may include Couflict Offices, \ncontracts with assigned counsel plans or programs or with  individual attorneys, as long as all providers of \nconflict defense services meet the standards for representation adopted by the Commission. \nB.  The enactment of the Indigent Defense Commission plan should be  followed  by an \nexpeditious phase-in schedule that sets reasonable time limits for: \n(1)  the  appointment of all  members  of tbe  Indigent Defense  Commission  and \n31 \n\ndesignation ofits chairperson; \n(2) the appointment of the Chief Defender; \n(3) the establishment by the Commission of the requisite Regional and Local Defender \nOffices; \n(4) the publication by the Commission of its initial set of standards and guidelines; \n(5) the review and evalnation by the Chief Defender and the Commission of each \nexisting defender program in the state; \n(6) the effective date on which the Commission shall take over the responsibility and \nfunding of all indigent defense programs in the state as designated by the Commission. \nThe Commission recognizes that implementation ofa  statewide defender system cannot be achieved \novernight.  However, in light of the crisis in defense representation that we have detailed and from which \nour proposal springs, its implementation must be undertaken with the greatest urgency lest many more \nthousands of impoverished defendants are deprived of their consitntional rights to a quality defense. \nC.  Adeqnate funding of indigent criminal defense must be provided by the New York \nLegislature from tbe State's General Fund, not from the counties. County funding should be phased \nout over a three-year period. \nNew York's experience since 1965 has demonstrated that a system of minimal state funding with \nprimary fmancial responsibility at the county level does not work.  It results in an inadequate and in many \nrespects, an unconstitntionallevel of representation and creates significant disparities in the quality of \nrepresentation based on no factor other than geography,  thereby impugning the fairness of New York's \ncriminal justice system.  No substantial improvement can be achieved in the provision of indigent defense \nservices in the state without a significant increase in overall state funding and the elimination oflocal funding. \nNew York should join the majority of states that fund 100 percent of all costs of their indigent defense \nsystem. A system ofd irect state funding atthe requisite adequate level will eliminate the geographic disparity \nin representation that currently abounds throughoutthe state. Because local funding drives up local costs and \nrequires local choices to be made among social benefit programs, a state·funded defense system will spread \nout costs on a statewide basis and lessen greatly the fIScal impact on counties. \n32 \n\nD.  The system for funding indigent criminal defense services shonld provide for elimination \nof the overall disparity between prosecntion and defense resonrces so as to achieve \"adequate and \nbalanced fuuding\" defense representation. \nA justice system's funding program that does not take into account disparities between prosecution \nand defense resources is neither fair nor sensible. It deprives indigent defendants oft heir constitutional rights \nand relegates the defense function, despite constitutional and statutory mandates, to a fonn of second class \ncitizenship.  There exists no justification for such imbalance and inequity in a system that professes to \ncomport with one of the basic tenets of our legal system, \"equaljustice for all.\" \nE.  A comprehensive data collection system designed to provide an accnrate picture of the \nprovision of indigent criminal defense  services  in New York State should  be established  and \nmaintained.  Such a system would enable policy makers and administrators to make informed \njndgments concerning the administration of the indigent defense system and plan for improvements. \n(1) There should be established a single source for reliable, indigent defense case activity and cost \nthat can provide a complete and accurate picture of the system statewide and by region. \n(2) The data system that is developed should be consistent with the plan for an overall criminaljustice \ncoordinated system currently being developed in New York State. \n(3) All case and cost infonnation should be entered in a single, statewide database that mnst also \ninclude the data collected for non-fingerprintable offenses. \nIV.  Conclusion \nFor more than two years, the Commission has examined the provision of indigent criminal defense \nservices in New York State.  We have been aided immeasurably by the high quality, professional study \nconducted by The Spangenberg Group. As a result oft his undertaking, we have concluded that nothing short \nof major, far-reaching, reform can ensure that New York meets its constitutional and statutory obligations \nto provide quality representation to every indigent person accused of a crime or other offense. That \nsubstantially more funding must be dedicated to accomplishment of this task is a fact that can neither be \ndisputed nor ignored.  However, we also conclude that an infusion of additional funds, while absolutely \n33 \n\nnecessary, will not suffice.  There must be established a statewide defender system, such as we have \nproposed, that is truly independent and which is structured to enforce standards of performance and demand \ntrue accountability from all who have the responsibility for defending those accused of a  crime or other \noffenses. It must be a system for which the State of New York, not the counties, assumes full responsibility \nfor  funding.  Only through such a system can constitutional mandates  for  quality  indigent defense \nrepresentation be realized on an equal basis throughout the state. \nThis Report is not the fIrst to examine the adequacy ofindigent legal representation in criminal cases \nin this state. Indeed, in this Report, we have catalogued the history of attempts by various organizations over \nthe last 40 years to call attention to the defects in New York's manner of providing for indigent defense \nrepresentation.  But our  Report,  considered  in tandem  with  The  Spangenberg Report,  is the  most \ncomprehensive evaluation ever doue in New York State. It signals tlmtthe time for further study is over. The \ncrisis in indigent representation in this state is a well documented fact. The time for action is now. \n34 \n\nADDENDUM' \nI.  GENERAL PROPOSALS \nA.  Amend the Rules of the Chief Administrator to require that the denial by a \ntrial court ofa n asSigned connsel's request for appointment of an investigator \nor expert under County Law section 722-c be set forth in a written order with \nwritten findings of fact supporting the court's determination. \nThe Spangenberg Report is replete with examples from around the State of what appear to \nbe improper, summary denials by trial courts of assigned counsel requests for appointment of investigators \nand experts. under County Law section 722-c. According to the RePort,judges considering these reql!estS are \nwell.aware that costs for investigative and expert services under section 722-c are borne by the county, and, \n\"[i]n this respect, the courts are put in the position of guarding the county's coffer. This unavoidable and \nunenviable role is not lost on many judges who are constrained by limited county funds.\" (SR at 74) By \nrequiring that all orders denying requested services under that section be in writing and contain written \nfmdings offaCI in support of the court's determination, the proposed rule will help to ensure that: (1) these \ndeterminations are not based on inappropriate and irrelevant factors such as the fiscal status oft he county at \nthe time of the request; and (2) a proper record ofthe court's decision - including a decision rendered in a \nTown or Village Court where the proceedings are not recorded - is available in the event the defendant is \nultimately convicted and raises the court's denial of his or her section 722-c request on appeal. In keeping \nwith the ex parte nature of most of these section 722-c applications, the proposed amendment should allow \nthe defense to request that any such written order and fmdings of fact be sealed until after the verdict is \nentered. \nB.  Amend the Rnles of the Chief Administrator to permit administrative review \nof a trial court order reducing or denying a claim for compensation submitted \nby an assigned at1orney, expert or investigator. \nSection 127.2(b ) ofthe Rules oft he Chief Administrator currently provides, in relevant part, \nthat a trial court order awarding compepsation to an assigned attorney, investigator or expert in excess of the \nstatutory limits set forth in Article 18-B \"may be reviewed by the appropriate administrative judge, with or \nwithout application, who may modify the award if it is found that the award reflects an abnse of discretion \nby the trial judge.\" 22 NYCRR 127.2(b). Pursuant to subdivision (c) of section 127.2, \"[a]n application for \nreview may be made by any person or governmental body affected by the order.\" The Commission believes \nthat defense attorneys, experts and investigators whose claims for compensation under article 18-B are \nreduced or denied by a trial judge should be allowed to have that determination reviewed administratively. \nAccordingly, the Commissiontecommends that Part 127 oft he Rules oft he Chief Administrator be amended \nto permit administrative review ofa trial court order reducing or denying a claim for compensation submitted \nby an assigned attorney, expert or investigator.  \n•A s noted in the Preface, this addendum sets forth interim measures which the Commission believes would \nhelp to ameliorate a number of specific difficulties that adversely affect representation of indigent defendants in the \nstate.  These measures, if implemented, should not be understood to undercut, in any way, the necessi1y for the broad \nreforms that are presented in the main body of this Report. \nAD-I \n\nC.  Revise and periodically review OCA's hourly rate guidelines for investigators \nand expeI1S, and develop and maintain a statewide list ofa vailable investigators \nand experts. \nIn February of 1992, ilien-Chief Administrator Matthew Crosson issued an administrative \norder (hereinafter ''the order\") adopting hourly rate \"guidelines for ilie payment of reasonable compensation \nto court-appointed psychiatrists and othernonlawyeq:irofessionals\" pursuant to Judiciary Law section 35 and \nCounty Law section 722-c. Presumably intended to provide guidance to trial judges in complying with ilie \nstatutory requirement iliat the court determine \"reasonable compensation\" for experts and investigators \nassigned  pursuant to  these  two  sections,  ilie  order listed  five  \"categori[es]· of professional[s]\" and \ncorresponding hourly rates. Despite the Legislature's more ilian tripling oft he statutory cap for investigative \nand expert services under section 722-c in 1993, the houely rate guidelines established by ilie order have \nremained unchanged for more than 14 years. The Commission finds iliat ilie issuance by OCA of updated \nhourly rate guidelines fur investigaturs, experts·andotherprofessionais retained by assigned counsel and oilier \nindigent defense providers would help to facilitate the broader nse by these providers ofiliese critical services. \nSee, SR at 74-76. Accordingly, the Commission recommends that ilie Chief Administrative Judge issue a new \nadministrative order updating the hourly rate guidelines, and that OCA review the guidelines at least every \ntwo years and update them as needed. \nThe Commission further finds that there is currently a need for a statewide list 0 f experts and \ninvestigators who are willing and able to take cases at guideline rates. See, SR at 76-77. Accordingly, ilie \nCommission also reCommends that OCA develop, maintain and make available to indigent defense providers \nand judges throughout the State a non-exclusivel list of investigators and experts who are available to take \nassignments at guideliue rates. The list should be reviewed and updated frequently by OCA. \nD.  Expand the number of non-Penal Law petty offenses subject to the existing \nplea-by-mail procedure in the Summons Part ofthe NYC Criminal Court. \nPursuant to section 61 of ilie NYC Criminal Court Act and section 200.25 ofilie Uniform \nRules for ilie Trial Courts, a defendant who has been served wiili an appearance ticket in lieu of an arrest, \nreturnable in the Summons Part oHhe NYC Criminal Court, for a petty offense defined outside of the Penal \nLaw that has been specifically designated by ilie Administrative Judge of the NYC Criminal Court as \n\"appropriate for disposition\" under that section, may waive arraigmnent in open court and the right to \ncounse~ and offer to plead gUilty to ilie offense by mail and pay a specified fme and surcharge. See, 22 \nNYCRR section 200.25(a) and (b). To date, the Administrative Judge of the NYC Criminal Court has \ndesignated one offense, \"Consumption of Alcohol on ilie Streets\" (NYC Administrative Code section 10-\nl25(b», as \"appropriate for disposition\" under iliat section. The Commission believes that expanding ilie \nnumber ofn on-criminal NYC Administrative Code offenses subjectto the plea-by-mail procedures ofs ection \n200.25 would allow indigent defense providers in NYC to better allocate ilieir limited resources to more \nserious (i.e., misdemeanor and felony) prosecutions.2 Accordingly, the Commission recommends iliat the \nAdministrative Judge oft he NYC Criminal Court exercise his or her existing auiliority under section 200.25 \nto so expand the list of plea-by-mail offenses.  In determining which additional offenses \"would be \nappropriate for disposition\" by mail, ilie Commission further recommends that the Administrative Judge not \ninclude any offense iliat might result in future \"collateral consequences\" to ilie defendant as a result of the \nplea. \nE.  Amend the CPL aud other relevant statutes to expand the availability of plea-\nAD-2 \n\nby-mail procedures for selected petty offenses prosecuted outside NYC. \nBecanse the section 200.25 plea-by-mall procedure adopted pursuant to the NYC Criminal \nCourt Act cannot currently be applied in jurisdictions outside New York City, in order to conserve limited \nindigent defense resources in these jurisdictions the Commission recommends thatthe Legislature amend the \nCPL and other relevant statutes to allow for the expanded nse in upstate counties of plea. by -mail procedures \nfor selected non-criminal, non-Penal Law offenses that currently require the defendant's personal appearance \nin court, andlor an appearance by counsel, at arraignment. See, generally, CPL section 170.1 0(1 )(a) and \n(1)(b).  As with the New York City plea.by-mail rule, this procedure should not be used if the plea might \nresult in future collateral consequences.-\nF.  Amend  Joint Rules  of the Appellate  Divisions  to  require  that full·time \ndefenders earn no less than 18 CLE credits, and other defenders earn no less \nthan 12 CLE credits, every two years In criminal law~ \nThe Commission finds that while some defender institutions aggressively train their attorneys \nand  although  the  New  York  State  Defenders  Association  has  worked  admirably  to  improve  the \nprofessionalism of participating counsel, many attorneys remain under-prepared fur their representations. \nMany defenders - institutional defenders and panel attorneys alike - fail to receive the ongoing, cutting-edge \ntraining in defense issues that their posts require.  Even assuming that indigent defenders meet their \nContinuing Legal Education (\"CLE\") requirements for overall number of credits (see, 22 NYCRR section \n1500.22[a] [24 credits, including four in ethics and professionalism, per biennium]), there is no requirement \nthat defenders dedicate any portion of their CLE credits to matters relevant to defense of the indigent.  111e \nevidence is that cost and time constraints require many defenders to meet CLE requirements without regard \nto subject matter. The Commission recommends that the Joint Rules of the Appellate Divisions be modified \nto require that every two years full-time defenders earn no less than 18 CLE credits, and all other defenders \nearn no less than 12 CLE credits in courses related to criminal law. In tum, the OCA Attorney Registration \nForm will need to be amended to reflect these new CLE Rules and allow enforcement as under current law. \nG.  Expand Opportunities for Free CLE and joint training opportunities \nwith prosecutors. \nApart from the substance of indigent defender training, cost remains a frequent impediment to \ndefender training.  The Commission urges every possible means be explored to provide defenders with free \norreduced-rate CLE. The Commission calls on law schools and bar associations offering CLE programs, and \nthe Judiciary itself, to make special efforts to make available CLE Board-certified training available at low \nor no cost to indigent defense attorneys and to publicize such opportunities by all practicable means. \nAnother helpful step would be the creation of specific training programs in which indigent defense \nattorneys and prosecutors would participate jointly.  It is important that prosecutors be cognizant of issues \nthat  affect  indigent  defense  representation,  especially  the  ever-growing  universe  of the  collateral \nconsequences of a criminal conviction. In this regard, some curricula important for the defense function, are \nalso important for prosecutors. The Commission therefore recommends that the New York State Defenders \nAssociation, perhaps under the sponsorship of the New York State Judicial Institute, develop joint training \nprotocols.  ~ \nH.  Modify Rule 17.4 oft he Rules of the Chief Judge to require thattrlaljudges exerCising \ncriminal jurisdiction complete an OCA-certified program in indigent defense and \nAD·3 \n\nrelated topics every two years. \nEffective judicial training in the complex issues surrounding indigent defense is as critical \nas effective defender training. There is a troubling lack of understanding by some judges about what \nconstitutes indigence, when and how indigency determinations must be made, when and how investigators, \nexperts and counsel should be appointed, etc. The Commission finds that a clear understanding of and \nsensitivity to these predicates to entry into the indigent defense system, as well as judicial knowledge of \ncollateral consequences of conviction are important for a meaningful indigent defense. The Commission \ntherefore recommends that the Rules of the Chief Judge be amended to require every judge or justice \npresiding in a court that exercises criminal jurisdiction to participate in a program approved by the Chief \nAdministrator of the Courts addressing issues relating to indigent defense.  Such a rule already exists for \ndomestic violence issues (see, 22 NYCRR [Rules of the Chief Judge] section 17.4[a]). \nI.  Take immediate steps to ensure that, in accordance with County Law \nsection 722(3), every existing C\\lllDty bar association assigned counsel program \nin the State' is operated pursuant to it written plan that has been filed with, \nreviewed and approved by OCA. \nDespite the requirements of County Law section 722(3) that a county's assigned counsel \nsystem be pursuant to a plan of the county's bar association, and that such plan be approved by the \"state \nadministrator\" (i.e., OCA) before it is placed in operation, \"in many counties, no such formal plan exists, nor \ndoes OCA appear to house a collection ofs uch plans submitted for approval pursuantto the law.\" (SR at 159) \nSee also, SR at 56, n171. It follows that when a county having a bar association plan elects to modify that \nplan, those changes must also be approved by OCA. According to the Spangenberg Report, as a result of the \n2004 increase in hourly rates for assigned counsel, a large number of counties, as a cost-saving measure, \nestablished new public defender or conflict defender offices or made other significant changes to their 18-B \nprograms for delivering indigent defense services. See, SRat 56-58, 159. To the extent these changes included \nsignificant modifications to an existing county bar association assigned counsel plan, such modifications \nshould have been reviewed and approved by OCA before being placed in operation. The Spangenberg Report \ncites only one example of a county whose modified bar plan was fonnally approved by OCA prior to \nimplementation. See, SR, Appendix J. \nIn light ofthe above, the Commission recommends that OCA take immediate steps to ensure \nthat, in accordance with County Law section 722(3), every existing county bar association assigned counsel \nprogram in the State is operated pursuant to a written plan that: (1) accurately reflects the program actually \nin operation in that county; and (2) has been filed with, reviewed and approved by OCA. \nJ.  Allow  defenders  to  use  CPL  article  182  videoconference  technology  to \ncommunicate securely with incarcerated clients. 2.  Enact legislation to make \nCPL article 182 anthorization statewide and permanent. \nThe Commission finds, as reflected in the Spangenberg Report, that \"[ iJndigent defendants \nthroughout the state suffer from a serious lack of contact from their attorneys. Too often, the only attorney \nclient contact takes place in court,\" and \"[t)his in-court contact is frequently brief and occurs in an area that \ncannot ensure confidentiality.\" (SR at 157)  Among the obstacles to frequent attorney-client visits are the \ngreat distances between certain courthouses where criminal cases are heard and the jail facilities where \ndefendants are housed, as well as, in New York City, the relative inaccessibility of the Rikers Island jails. \nCPL article 182 allows incarcerated defendants in enumerated counties to make certain court appearances by \nAD-4 \n\ntwo-way closed circuit television wi1110ut having to be broughtto court. Under current procedures, however, \n111ese two-way closed-circuit systems are generally used in conjunction wi111 formal court proceedings: \nbecause defenders are not granted access to 111e Bystem, a low-cost or even no-cost me1110d to connect \ndefendants with their appointed counsel, and 111us significantly to improve 111e  quality and quantity of \nattorney-client contact while fully protecting clients' rights, is needlessly lost.  Moreover,111e authorization \nto use 111is common-sense device sunsets every few years and is limited only to certain counties. To cure these \ninefficiencies and help defenders properly communicate wi111 their clients, the Commission urges that the \nJudiciary enact rules to give defenders access to the videoeonferenee system to eonnnunicate with their \nclients, and to introduce legislation to make 111is available system permanent and statewide. \nK.  Amend the Uniform Rules for the Trial Courts to require that Superior Courts \ncoud uct CPL 530.30 bail reviews promptly after arraignment in all cases where \nan incarcerated defendant has been arraigned without counsel. \nCPL section 530.30 allows for superior court review of bail and remand orders issued by a \nlocal criminal court, and permits 111e superior court to, inter alia, ROR a defendant held on bail or remanded \nby the loeai criminal court or fix bail in a lesser amount. In order to address the problem ofuurepresented \ndefendants languishing in jail on excessive bail following arraigrunent in a local criminal court, the \nCommission recommends that OCA amend the Uniform Rules for the Trial Courts to require that Superior \nCourts conduct CPL 530.30 bail reviews promptly after arraigrunent in all cases where an incarcerated \ndefendant has been arraigned without counsel. \nL.  Devote OCA and DCJS resources to improve the collection and \nverification of indigeut defense data. \nThe Commission fmds that there is currently a paucity ofr eliable, accurate data on indigent \ndefense services in the State. See, SRat 156. Pursuantto County Law 722-f(1), indigent defense providers \nare required to me annually a \"report with the judicial conference lOCAl at such times and in such detail and \nform as the judicial conference may direct.\" The current annual report is a one-page form (UCS-195).  As \nnoted in the Commission's Interim Report (see,  pp. 29-30), \"there are various errors, omissions, and \nconfusing data 011 a large number of [UCS-195] submissions by 111e counties.\" In addition, as noted by the \nSpangenberg Group, the \"self-reported UCS-195 information from the counties cannot be verified through \nany other data source.\" (SR at 156) This Commission fmds that a statewide Indigent Defense Conunission \nwould most certainly benefit from inunediately improving indigent defense data collection efforts, including \ndata collected through the UCS-J95 form, electronic data captured and transmitted to the Division ofC  riminal \nJustice Services (DCJS)  through OCA's \"CRIMS,\" \"ADBM\" and \"UCMS\" electronic case management \nsystems and specific data relating to counsel, investigator and expert assigrunents in 111e Criminal and Family \nCourts under County Law Article 18-B. See, SRat 156. Accordingly, the Commission recommends that OCA \nand DCJS devote the necessary resources to improve and streamline data collection and data verification \nprocesses in 111is critical area. \nM.  Create  an  office  or  entity  within  OCA  charged  with  facilitating the \nimplementation  of  this  Commission's  recommendations  and  preparing \ngenerally for implementation oCthe statewide defender system. \nTo prepare generally for implementation of the statewide defender system recommended by this \nConunission and help facilitate the implementation by OCA ofthe Commission's other recommendations, \nwe recommend the creation of a coordinating body within OCA to serve as a focal point on 111e complex and \nAD-S \n\ninterrelated issues of indigent defense.  Properly staffed, this office should, muong other things: \n•  compile and verifY indigent defense data (e.g., the bar association plans required to \nbe approved by the Chief Administrator under County Law § 722[3]); \n•  assist in the development and implementation ofj udicial education materials relating \nto indigent defense and collateral consequences of conviction; \n•  publicize  and  assist  in  implementing  rules  promUlgated  pursuant  to  this \nCommission's recommendations; \n•  coordinate with defense providers, and with the Indigent Defense Commission on \nthe Judiciary's behalf when created; \n•  create and distribute informational materials (e.g. videotapes) on defendant rights . \nand the nature of court proceedings to be shown in proper locations and at proper \ntimes in the adjudicative process; \n•  advocate generally for effective provision ofindigent defense services, including the \nenactment of the legislative recommendations of this report. \nII. TOWN AND VILLAGE COURT PROPOSALS \nA.  Amend the Uniform Rules for the Trial Courts to require Town and \nVillage Courts to electronically record all proceedings relating to felonies, \nmisdemeanors and Penal Law violations; allocate funds through OCA's \nJustice Court Assistance Program to assist localities in purchasing \nand maintaining the necessary recording equipmeut. \nAs noted in the Spangenberg Report, Town and Village Courts are not \"conrts of record,\" \nand criminal proceedings before these courts are, in most cases, conducted without preserving a verbatim \nrecord of those proceedings. See, SR at 160. Due in large part to the lack of a verbatim transcript of the \nproceedings, ~'it is often difficult or impossible for a defendant to adequately exercise the right to appeal a \ndecision by a local [Town or Village] justice.\" (SR at 161) The Commission believes that, ideally, there \nshould be a stenographic record ofa ll non-civil proceedings conducted in the Town and Village Courts, and \nthat these courts should, like all other criminal courts in the State, be \"courts of record,\" at least when \nexercising their criminal jurisdiction. However, requiring Town and Village Courts to electronically record \nall proceedings relating to felonies, misdemeanors and Penal Law violations, and providing state funqing \nthrough OCA's Justice Cou:r:t Assistance Progrmn to help localities obtain recording equipment, will enable \nthe preservation of an accurate and complete record of these proceedings for appellate review and other \npurposes. See, generally, Part 138 of the Rules of the Chief Administrator [\"Justice Court Assistance \nProgrrun\"J. \nB.  Establish a procedure to determine the extent ofc ompliance with section 200.26 \nof the  Uniform  Rules  for  Courts  Exercising  Criminal  Jurisdiction  and \nundertake appropriate action to ensure that Town and Village  justices \nconscientiously comply with the rule. \nSection 200.26 of the Uniform Rules for Courts Exercising Criminal Jurisdiction (hereinafter, ''the \nrule\"), requires Town and Village Courts, in cases where the defendant appears for arraignment without \ncounsel and either cmmot make bail or is remanded without bail, to make an initial determination as to the \nAD-6 \n\ndefendant's eligibility for assigned counsel. Where it appears thatthe defendant is fmancially unable to obtain \ncounsel, the court must assign counsel on the spot and promptly notifY both assigned counsel and the local \npretrial services agency oft he court's assignment and issuance of the bail or remand order. See, 22 NYCRR \nsection 200.26(c ). Under the rule, Town and Village Courts must maintain a record in the case file of any \ncommunications and correspondence initiated or received by the court pursuant to the rule. \nIt has been over a year since the rule was adopted and there has been no systematic effort to \ndetermine the extent to which the state's over 1200 Town and Village Courts are in compliance. Indeed, the \nSpangenberg Report cites numerous examples from around the state of Town and Village justices who are \nsimply unaware of the rule or are faiJingto comply with it (SRat 112-114) Accordingly, the Commission \nrecommends that the rule be amended to require Town and Village justices to periodically submit to OCA \na form listing cases where, at the initial appearance, the court either fixed ball that the defendant could not \nimmediately make, or remanded the defendant without bail; whether counsel was assigned in accordance with \nthe rule; and whether the notice and other requirements of the rule were satisfied. The form would be signed \nby the justice prior to submission. Using the completed forms, OCA would then conduct periodic audits of \nselected Town and Village Courts to review individual criminal case files and other relevant court records \n(see, generally, 22 NYCRR section 200.23) to determine compliance with the rule. \nC.  Amend Part 17.2 of the Rules of the Chief Judge to double to two \nweeks tbe minimum training for newly-selected non-attorney Town and Village \njustices. \nEducational programs fornewly-elected, non-attoruey Town and Village justices should be \nenhanced so that the justices are better informed and sensitized to the constitutional requirements and \nstandards for appointing counsel, investigators and experts. One present problem is that new non-attorney \njustices receive only a single week of basic courses (see 22 NYCRR [Rules of the Chief Judge] section \n17.2[a]), leaving little time for instruction on issues concerning the rights of indigent defendants. Even a \nqualified attorney might have significant difficulty rapidly absorbing and properly applying complex new \nmaterials of this  scope; for a lay person, the  challenge is more difficult. 111e Commission therefore \nrecommends that OCA revamp and expand training for non-attorney justices by doubling basic traIning to \ntwo weeks in the first year, perhaps in two one-week programs. While the Commission appreciates thatthese \nmandates could impose significant burdens both on localities with Town or Village Courts and participating \njustices (who often must take leaves of absence from their full-time jobs to participate in such training), \nexpanded basic education programs for non-attorney justices will help to provide protections for indigent \ndefendants' rights. \nD.  Revamp Town and Village Court training programs to \ninclude quarterly practical programs and remote programs. \nThe Commission further fmds that for attorney and non-attorney justices alike who have \nserved for fewer than four years, the anuual training provided is insufficient. Most Town and Village Courts \nare not convened daily and new justices have fewer opportunities to acclimate to their judicial duties. Further, \na significant proportion of justices are not attorueys and have little if any other legal training. Thus, the \ncurrent judicial training cycle becomes insufficient to build critical judicial skills. ~CA's experience is that \nmany local justices themselves have reported a desire for more frequent training. Supplemental training has \nbeen used in the Fifth Judicial District in the form ofm  ock proceedings. These educational opportunities have \nbeen very successful and shonid be made a standard tool of training, available to justices no less than \nquarterly, perhaps divided between attorney and non-attorney judges to provide targeted assistance suitable \nAD-7 \n\nto participants' level of prior legal training. The Commission further frods that the Town and Village Court \neducation program could significantly benefit from frequent telephone, video-conference and internet-based \nsymposia. \nE.  Increase publicity of Town and Village Court Resonrce Center. \nWhile the OCA Town and Village Court Resource Center has proved to be an invaluable \nresource to many local justices and staff with questions on all manner ofT  own and Village Court operations, \nprocedure and substantive law, the Commission fmds that the Resource Center might be even more helpful \nif more justices used it To this end, the Commission recommends thatthe Judiciary, in partnership with the \nNew York State Magistrates' Association and other stakeholders, better publicize the Resource Center to local \nofficials, and especially court staff, perhaps even by relatively simple means as desktop paraphernalia that \nremind Town and Village Courts of the assistance available to them. \nF.  Establish a mechanism to coordinate conflicting meeting times of \nlocal courts within each judicial district and county. \nDefenders and prosecutors reported significant difficulty in allocating staff among local \ncourts. The sheer number of City Courts and Town and Village Courts - in some counties numbering in the \ndozens and scattered across hundreds of square miles - makes staff allocations inefficient, expensive and \ninordinately complex.  Defenders and prosecutors report cases before multiple courts at the same time; \ndefenders report losing so much time traveling between courts that they cannot meaningfully meet with tlleir \nclients.  So long as there exist multiple criminal tribunals in each county, separated from central detention \nfacilities by significant distances, New York's indigent defense system will remain iriherently inefficient, \nfoisting wastefully high costs onto taxpayers and depriving clients of already scant time with their lawyers. \nTo mitigate these inefficiencies, the Commission urges systematic coordination of the terms of City, Town \nand Village Courts in each judicial district and county to improve the effectiveness of defense, prosecutiou \nand other law enforcement functions. Where one defender or prosecutor is assigned to multiple courts, these \ncourts never should convene at the same time.  Given the need for  a comprehensive approach, the \nCommission urges that the Judiciary take a lead role in working with local governments, prosecutors and \ndefenders, service providers and other stakeholders to ensure against scheduling conflicts among these local \ncourts.3  While the Commission recognizes the historical independence of each Towu or Village Court and \nits sponsoring locality, the complexity ofe fficiently providing indigent defense services - and the paramount \ninterest of making this fractured system work - no longer permits each Town or Village Court to operate in \na relative vacuum, without regard to the burdens of scheduling on defenders, prosecutors and taxpayers who \nfund their operations. \nG.  Promulgate a new Rule oft he Chief Judge designating interpreters on the OCA \nRegistry as \"Official Interpreters\" for the Town and Village Courts, and \namend the Uniform Rules for the Trial Courts to require Town and Village \nCourts to include in case records a finding either that the defendant spoke \nEnglish or had an OCA-certified interpreter. \nLanguage barriers invariably complicate the provision of iudigent defense services in the \ncourtroom. This is especially true in the Town and Village Courts. Town and Village Courts and sponsoring \nlocalities often lack proper interpreting services for many reasons - some are unaware oft heir duty to provide \nAD-8 \n\nthese services, o.thers do. no.tmake funds available fo.rthis purpo.se, and so.me languages are difficult fo.r which \nto. find qualified interpreters.  The Co.mmissio.n heard disturbing testimo.ny that in so.me To.wn and Village \nCo.urts, a defendant's family member, an arresting officer, a pro.secuto.r o.r even the judge serves as ad hoc \ninterpreter, raising a palpable risk o.f mis-translatio.n o.r wo.rse.  Mo.reo.ver, witho.ut a transcript o.f the \npro.ceedings, there may be no. way to. ensure o.n appeal o.r co.llateral review that no.n-English speaking \ndefendants' rights meaningfully to. participate in their o.wn defense are protected. In April 2006, OCA, no.ting \nthe need to. better co.nnect To.wn and Village Co.urts with qualified interpreters, reso.lved to. make available \nto. To.wn and Village Co.urts the OCA registry o.finterpreters qualified to. wo.rk in the State-paid Co.urts. The \nCommissio.n expects that the To.wn and Village Co.urts will fmd that this registry, co.upled with availabili1y \no.ftelepho.nic interpreting, will help speed engagement o.finterpreters, in almo.st any language, at any time \no.f day, in any Io.catio.n across the State. \nWhile the Co.mmissio.n applauds this OCA initiative, it will no.t fully address the real \nproblem, which relates as much to paying interpreters as finding them.  The !qo.t o.f the pro.blem is an \nanachro.nistic statute that caps the co.mpensatio.n o.fTo.wn and Village Courts' \"o.fficialinterpreters\" at just \n$25 per day, paid by the co.un1y. See, Judiciary Law section 387.4 Because few ifa ny To.wn o.r Village Courts \nretain an \"official interpreter\" and few if any qualified interpreters agree to. work fo.r $25, Town and Village \nCo.urts face a daunting choice: proceed without an interpreter (and thus po.tentially violate a defendant's \nconstitutional rights), o.r engage an interpreter and o.rder Io.calities to pay fees often far in excess o.f$25 (i.e., \nvio.late section 387 and foist o.stensibly unautho.rized fmancial burdens on the sponso.ring 10cali1y).s There \nare widespread repo.rts that when a justice do.es engage an interpreter o.n pro.mise o.f payment, the justice \nenco.unters significant resistance from the Io.cality, making it harder to retain interpreters in later cases. Given \nthat qualified interpreters in State-paid co.urts now earn $250 per day, the Co.mmissio.n fmds that this $25 cap \nfrustrates  defendants' rights to participate in their o.wn defense, and concurs in the New Yo.rk State \nMagistrates Associatio.n's call for the Legislature to end this restriction. \nThe Commission concludes, however, that the exigency o.fthis problem do.es not allow New \nYo.rk to. wait for a legislative solution, nor need we wait.  The recent establishment o.f a Statewide registry \nofinterpreters and OCA's initiative to. make this registry available to. To.wn and Village Courts to.gether create \na vehicle by which the Judiciary itself can aid in reso.lvingthe problem. To this end, co.nsistent with the Chief \nJudge's power to. establish standards and administrative po.licies of statewide applicabili1y fo.r all New York \ncourts including the To.wn and Village Courts,' the Co.mmission proposes thatthe Judiciary promulgate a rule \nreco.gnizing interpreters listed o.n the registry as \"official interpreters\" within the meaning o.f Judiciary Law \nsection 387.  Snch a rule would require Town and Village Courts to. exhaust the OCA registry before \nappointing an outside interpreter, and thus obviate the anachronistic $25 cap in almo.st all cases. \nOf course, requiring Town and Village Co.urts to use the OCA registry (and presumably to \npay OCA rates), will impo.se new Co.sts o.n localities, and create a disincentive for justices to. appo.int \ninterpreters, much like courts' disincentives to. appoint investigators and experts whose fees are paid by the \nco.un1y.  To address this disincentive, the Co.mmissio.n propo.ses amending section 200.23(b) oft he Uniform \nRule for the Trial Co.urts to. marginally expand the existing repo.rting requirements fo.r To.wn and Village \nCo.urts in criminal cases. This amendment wo.uld require To.wn and Village Co.urts to. include in each case \nfile a statement either that the defendant was fluent in English o.r that the Court engaged an interpreter \ncertified by OCA to. translate in the defendant's language for all proceedings. Because this statement wo.uld \nbecome part of each case reco.rd, this new rule would sensitize justices to. their du1y to. appoint qualified \ninterpreters and provide at least some do.cumentary basis on which to review these proceedings. \nAD-9 \n\nH.  Amend Judiciary Law section 387 to lift the $25/day cap on Town and Village \nCourt temporary interpl'eter compensation and make these costs reim bursable \nby the State. \nRecoguizingthe potential scope oft he cost of interpreters and that Town and Village Courts \nmay still need to engage outside interpreters, the Commission fmds thatj udicial regulation alone cannot fully \naddress the problem. A complete and fairway ofd ealing with the issue would be for the Legislature to amend \nsection 387 to eliminate the $25 cap and make all interpreting costs reimbursable by the State at rates fixed \nin advance by the Chief Administrator oft he Courts. Such an amendment would eliminate many operational \nand political impediments to meeting Town and Village Court obligations to appoint interpreters, and thereby \nmake great strides to help vindicate many indigent defendants' constitutional rights in the Town and Village \nCourts. \nEndnotes \n1Under the Connnission's proposal, indigent defense providers would, of course, be free to retain an investigator or \nexpert who does not appear on the OCA-prepared list The Commission would further recommend that, in \ndistributing the proposed list, OCA make clear to defense providers and judges that the list in no way constitutes an \nendorsement by OCA of the quality of services provided by any of the listed experts or investigators. \n2 According tu !he Spangenberg Report, from 1991 to 2004 !here was a dramatic increase in summonses filed in \nNYC, from 98,278 in 1991 to 581,734 in 2004, an increase of 491 percent (SR at 141) Moreover, according tu the \nSpangenberg Report, in 2001, 98 percent of summonses in NYC were disposed of at amrlgnment, and it is estimated \nthat a similar percentage are so disposed of tuday. ld. \n3The Connnission notes !hat !he New Y< irk State Constitution and the Judiciary Law invest in the Chief Judge \nregnlatory atithority herself to enact rules that would harmonize local court schedules ~ NY Const, art VI, §§ I[a], \n28[b]; Judiciary Law §§ 2Jl[I][aj, 212[IJ[c]). Under this authority, the CblefJudge or her designates, including !he \nadministrative judges of each judicial district, likewise may work with affected stakeholders to avoid scheduling \nconflicts. \n4\"If!he services of an inte1preter be required * * • and !here be no unemployed Il& available J official interpreter to \nact, !he court may appoint an inte1preter to act temporarily in such court.

Penelope Clute, Hon. Patricia Marks, Laurie Shanks \nAnd Hon. Elaine Jackson Stack join. \nJune 20, 2006 \n\"The poor man looks upon the law \nas an enemy, not as a friend.  For \nhim, the law is always taking \nsomething away.\" \nAttorney General Robert Kennedy, Law Day, May\"J, 1964 \nThe Commission's report concludes that \"the time for further study is over ... [t]he time \nwe \nfor action is now.,,1  I wholeheartedly concur; there is no need for \"further study\" and  must act \n\"now.\"  Every day in this state, thousands of people whO are unable to afford Counsel are being \nvictimized as constitutional and ethical standards of effective assistance of counsel are routinely \nreduced to platitudes.  Yet all the report essentially does is recommend \"further study.\"  Faced \nwith the voluminous and detailed fmdmgs of the Spangenberg report,2 which, parenthetically, \ncome as no surprise to those who labor regularly in the Criminal Courts, the Commission merely \nrecommends the same proposal that the New York State Defenders' Association (NYSDA) and \nthe Committee for an Independent Public Defense Commission (spearheaded by the self-same \nNYSDA) first put on the table a few years ago -a statewide entity to oversee and coordinate the \nmyriad indigent defense systems in place across the state.3  While I concur that the case can \ncertainly be made for a unified approach to the funding,  delivery  and oversight of indigent \ndefense, more must be done, and on an immediate basis, to address the ongoing crisis in indigent \ndefense. \nFaced with indisputable evidence of a crisis of epic proportions, the Commission chooses \nto recommend the. formation of another Commission.  Ironically, that new Commission will no \ndoubt be comprised of many of the same folks on this Commission.  And, no doubt, the new \nCommission's flIst step will be to look to the Spangenberg report that is presently sitting in front \nof this Commission.  By then, however, the report will be a few years old, so it will require \nrehiring  Spangenberg for  an update.  Thereafter, the Commission should be poised  to  take \n\"action.\"  The Commission's decision to  leave for  another day and another body efforts to \naddress immediately the apparent and well-documented sorry state of indigent defense  is an \ninadequate response to a crisis.  For that reason, I dissent from that part of the Commission's \nreport which extols the formation of a new Commission as the panacea for all that ails indigent \ndefense in this state. \nAnd what exactly is the crisis that demands immediate attention?  Is it about a lack of \nmoney,  as  the  Commission's  report emphasizes?  Of course  indigent defense  is,  and  has \nhistorically always been, drastically underfunded.  That shameful reality was common knowledge \nCommission report at 42. \n1 \nThe Spangenberg report is attached to the Commission's report as Appendix B. \n2 \nThe Committee for an Independent Public Defense Commission (ClPDC) was fooned in 2001, and soon \n3 \nthereafter recommended the creation of an independent, statewide indigent defense oversight commission. \nRecently, the ClPDC presented a draft bill to legislative leaders.  In fact, according to the Commission's \nreport, a bill providing for an independent public defense commission was introduced by Senator Dale \nVolker and Assemblyman Martin Luster more than four years ago.  Commission report at 17. \n1 \n\nlong before  this  Commission was  convened.  Should the myriad defense  organizations and \nprograms throughout the state be organized in some coherent way?  Yes, but the crisis is about \nmuch more than funding and structure.  Limiting the analysis to those factors serves to obfuscate \nthe central issue - there must be careful examination of what it is that defenders of the indigent \naccused actually do and do not do.  It is well past time for a comprehensive study and critique of \nthe nature and quaJity of the work. \nThe time is ripe for such a discussion.  On May 25, 2006, the New York Law Journal \nreported the decision in People v. DeJesus, where the court held that a defendant was not entitled \nto  have  his  conviction  set  aside  even though  he  had  not been  advised  that his  plea to  a \nmisdemeanor would automatically result in deportation.  Reserving for another time and place a \nlegal analysis of the holding, more to the direct point is the question of how it came to pass that a \nlawyer failed to know, Of talk with his client about, the deportation consequences of a plea.  That \nis a window into the real crisis. \nThe Spangenberg report itself documents the genesis of these tragedies.  \"By the year \n2000, IS-B attorneys [in New York City] were disposing of 69 percent of all misdemeanor cases \nat  arraignment.,,4  Should  not  this  Commission  be  concerned  with  such  alarmingly  high \ndisposition rates, particularly at the accused's fIrst court appearance?  Should not there as well be \nan in-depth analysis of the general prevalence of guilty pleas and the corresponding lack of \nlitigation?  Just why is the plea rate so high?  Are indigent defenders in some form coercing or \nsubtly influencing their clients into pleading guilty early and often?  Or are defense lawyers \nfailing to listen to their clients andlor to value the benefits to their clients of actively contesting \nthe charges?  In the current climate of concerns about innocence and wrongful convictions,S as \nwell as in the aftermath of the fmdings of police misconduct by the Mollen Commission6 and the \nAttorney General's \"stop-and-frisk\" investigation/ should not there be a clarion call for defense \nlawyers to actively investigate and litigate? \nConcerns about the reliance on gUilty pleas are exacerbated by the explosion of collateral \nconsequences attendant to conviction.  It is undoubtedly harder than ever before for a defense \nattorney to navigate through the deluge of punishments that follow from a conviction.  With that \nin mind, one would expect, and demand, that plea rates, especially at arraignment, would be \ndecreasing.  Yet, as Spangenberg observed in his report, \"Collateral consequences of a criminal \nconviction are of particular concern in New York City as snch a high percentage of cases plead \nout at arraignment and defense counsel spends verY little time with their clients before a plea is \nentered.,,8  Spangenberg further noted <the lack of any real litigation: \"Because so many cases \nplead at arraignment, litigation and motion practice has changed in New York City, with verY few \npretrial motions filed, especially in misdemeanor cases.,,9  This Commission cannot remain silent \nin the face of these revelations. \n4 Spangenberg report at 142. \n5 See, e.g., Adam Liptak, Study Suspects Thousands ofF alse Convictions, N.Y. Times, Apr. 19, 2004, at \nA15. \n6 Commission to Investigate Allegations of Police Cormption and the Anti-Corruption Procedures of the \nPolice Dep't, Cil)' of New York, Commission Report (1994). \nOffice of New York State Attorney General Blliot Spitzer, the New York Cil)' Police Depar1ment's \"Stop \n7 \n& Frisk\" Practices: A Report to the People of the State of New York from the Office of the Attorney \nGeneral, Dec. 1, 1999. \n8 Spangenberg report at 144·45. \n9 Spangenberg report at 144. \n2 \n\nInstead, why not recommend bold steps, as did the  Broward County, Florida Public \nDefender?  In a letter to all judges of the Criminal Court, he wrote that he had \"forbidden his \nattorneys from advising indigent criminal defendants to plead guilty at arraignment unless they've \nhad 'meaningful contact' with their clients in advance.\"w  He reasoned that his lawyers were \nethically and legally constrained from  pleading clients guilty  without having established an \nattorney-client relationship and having investigated the circumstances of the charges.ll  Notably, \nhis actions seem to have the support of the local prosecutor.12  In addition to simply being the \nright thing to do, his actions brought his office into conformity with the extant American Bar \nAssociation  Standards,  which  state  that  \"[ulnder  no  circumstances  should  defense  counsel \nrecommend to a defendant acceptance of a plea unless appropriate investigation and study of the \ncase has been completed, including an analysis of controlling Jaw and the evidence likely to be \nintroduced at trial.,,13  In fact, the standards recently promUlgated by the New York State Bar \nAssociation contain similar cautions against p,leas at arraignments unless or until adequate factual \nand  legal  investigation  has  taken  place. 4  Yet  this  Commission  chooses  to  make  no \nrecommendations regarding plea rates generally, pleas at arraignments in particular, or the overall \nconfluence of pleas and collateral consequences. \nWe have heard and seen how problem-solving and community courts are proliferating. \nDoes this  Commission address  the  fundamental  issues those  changes portend?  How can a \ndefense attorney be most effective in those settings?  Has the Commission given consideration to \nwhere a defense provider should ideally be located?  Does not a Commnnity Court suggest a \ncommunity defense office?  Again, the Commission chooses to leave these crucial, fundamental \nquestions for another body at another time. \nWhere is the input of those most affected by indigent defense providers - clients and their \nfamilies and communities?ls  What do those constituencies have to say about indigent defense? \nl6 \nWhy is it that every so-called \"consumer perspective\" study since Gideon v Wainwright has \nfound that clients harbor great resentment and mistrust toward their appointed attorneys?17  Most \nstudies have found that clients perceive their lawyers to be primarily interested in getting them to \n10 ban Christensen, No More Instant Plea Deals, Says Public Defender, Daily Business Review, June 6, \n2005. \nI1 Id. \n12Id. \nI'A BA Standards for Criminal Justice, Prosecution Function and Defense Function, Standard 4-6.1 (3d ed. \n1993). \n14 The New York State Bar Association Standards for Providing Mandated Representation (adopted by the \nNew York State Bar Association House of Delegates on April 2, 2005) state in relevant part that counsel \nmust \"provide the client with the opportunity to make an intelligent and well-informed decision in those \ninstances when such decision is to be made by the client (ie, whether to plead guilty)\" (1-3); \"[obtain] all \navailable information concerning the client's background and circumstances for purposes of ... avoiding, if \nat all possible, collateral consequences\" (I-7a .); and \"[provide) the client with full information concerning \nsuch matters as ... immigration ... and other collateral consequences\" (I-7e.). Pleas at arraignments \nviolate the letter and spirit of each of these standards. \nThe Commission's report notas that \"TSG [The Spangenberg Group] spoke with defense attorneys, \nIS \njudges and court personne~ as well as with state, county, and city officials with knowledge of the criminal \njustice system.\" Commission report at 3. Noticeably lacking is any input from present or past clients and \ntheir fanu1ies, commmrities and advocacy organizations. \n16\n372 U.S. 335 (1963). \n17 See, e.g., Jonathan D. Casper, Criminal Justice-The Consumer's Perspective (Nat'llnst. Of Law \nEnforcement and Crim. Just Ed., 1972); Suzanne E. Mounts, Public Defender Programs, Professional \nResponsibility, and Competent Representation, 1982 Wis. L. Rev. 473, 474 (\"That many clients are \nsuspicious o~ sometimes even hostile towards, their defenders has been repeatedly documented.\"). \n3 \n\nplead guilty.'s  The reality of that perception is no doubt borne out in the Spangenberg findings. \nOther  seemingly  intractable  issues  that  surface  in  those  studies  beg  serious  thought.  Not \nsurprisingly, indigent defendants express concern that they have no say in the selection of their \nlawyer'• and that he or she is appointed to them by the govemment?O  Compounding the problem \nis the ever-present belief that anything free is worth what you paid for it,2l and also that so many \ndefense  attorneys seem  to  their clients to be inextricably  linked with the other institutional \nplayers?Z  Are there possible solutions to these longstanding problems? Is not that the core of'the \noriginal charge to the Commission - to confront difficult issues and to try to develop creative \nsolutions?  One such example is the concept of \"Judicare,\" a kind of Medicare for legal needs.23 \nRather than consider such initiatives or think about ways of reconceptualizing indigent defense, \nthe Commission report clings to the one thread of a statewide defense commission as if it is a \ncure-alL \nSimilarly, how can a Commission focused on indigent defense not squarely address the \nissue of race?24  Who are the clients, what policing decisions brought them into court, who are the \ndefenders, and how does the judiciary treat the accused?  These questions have to be part and \nparcel of any report about criminal defense of the indigent. \nThe Commission's report should confront and address  at  least select items from  the \nSpangenberg  report's  fifty-five  fmdings.  For  example,  as  the  Spangenberg  report  makes \nzs \nabundantly  clear,  most  defense  lawyers  for  the  indigent  have  excessive  caseloads.\nConcomitantly, the report states that \"[i]n New York, we did not encounter any institutional \nprovider that had its own meaningful, written caseJoad standards,,,z6 and that as a result, \"they are \nhandling heavy caseloads that are well in excess of the national standards.\"z7  While developing \nSee, e.g., Casper, supra note 17. \nIS \nI.

Yet the Commission \ndeclines to recommend caseload standards of any kind.29 \nDefending the indigent accused requires attorneys who understand and are ready to \nconfront the modern age of \"quality of life\" and ''zero tolerance\" policing.  Those lawyers must \nalso be equipped to uavigate through the newly developing problem-solving and community \n. conrts.  And while every single arrest is brutally important, significant and meaningful to the \nperson  arrested,  burgeoning  collateral  consequences  have  raised the  stakes.  A  heretofore \nrelatively \"innocuous\" charge can now lead to deportation, eviction, loss of government benefits, \nand a host of other problems, in addition to the fear, humiliation, frustration and concern that \nfullows ewry arrest  111e . new age of criminal Pl1lctice fe<Lllire.s a new approach to criminal \ndefense.  Instead, the Spangenberg report paints a picture of rapid pleas and little or no motion \npractice.  That reality must be confronted immediately. \nThere are hard questions to tackle but this Commission chooses to reserve them for \nanother body at another time in the future.  The notion seems to be that it is sufficient, or best, to \nwait for the Legislature to approve an adequately funded statewide commission.  All seem to \nagree there is a crisis in defense of the indigent.  To wait for legislative action strikes me as an \nunacceptable response to a crisis.  I concur wholeheartedly with this much of the Commission's \nreport -there \"is no need for further study - the time for action is now.\" \n28 See, e.g., Scott Wallace & David Carroll, The Implementation and Impact of Indigent Defense Standards, \n31 S.U. L. Rev. 245 (2004) . \n. 29 Part III of the Commission's report is titled, \"The Commission's Recommendations.\" The \nrecommendations that follow relate almost exclusively to the statewide defense commission. In a footnote, \nthe report references \"a number of interim measures that the Unified Court System can take immediately to \nameliorate a number of deficiencies that adversely affect the representation of indigent defendants.\" \nCommission report at n.39. Given the overarching nature of the Commission's original mandate, and the \nmagnitnde of the indigent defense crisis that has now been documented, it seems more appropriate to insert \nthose \"measures\" directly into the relevant portion of the text, rather than relegate them to a footnote and \n\"Addendum.\" In fact, those measures represent the tip of the iceberg. Any number of additional steps \ncould, and shonid, have been recommended in order to have an immediate, positive impact on the delivery \nof defense services. \n5 \n\nAdditional Commentary of Klaus Eppler In Which Hon. Penelope Clute, \nLaurie Shanks, Hon. Elaine Jackson Stack And Steven Zeidman Join \nJune 19,2006 \nI wholeheartedly  support the recommendations of the Commission. not only in its principal \nrecommendation for a fully state funded system and the establishment of an Indigent Defense \nCommission (\"IDC\") directed and empowered to provide quality representation to indigent \ndefendants, but also all the other recommendations in the Report including those in the Report \nAddendum.  I believe that the truly monumental, thorough and detailed report of The \nSpangenberg Group will lend undeniably convincingsllpporf; to the urgency of a49pting the \nCommission's principal recommendations.  As the First Chair of the Indigent Defense \nOrganization Oversight Commission (\"IDOOC\") in the First Department and subsequently the \nChair of the Committee in the First Department which issued the Report in 2001 on the Crisis in \nthe Legal Representation of the Poor, I strongly believe that an independent agency's power to \nset, monitor and enforce standards - and to provide funding to support such standards - is the \nkey to the provision of quality mandated legal representation. \nThere are two reasons for my feeling compelled to add a separate writing to the Commission's \nReport:  First is the decision of this Commission - charged with making recommendations as to \nthe future of indigent defense services in New York - not to make recommendations (or even \nexpress preferences) as to the system the IDC shonld strive for.  It is my view that in the interest \nof the justice system, indigent defense services in New York State should be proVided through a \nhybrid system that includes both an institutional provider component and a private bar -\nassigned counsel component. \nSecond, sharing Professor Zeidman's concern that the \"crisis of epic proportions\" requires \nimmediate attention -- and not just by the legislature, I would have preferred that the \nCommission strongly advocate for the inunediate. adoption of minimum standards by all \ninstitutional providers and assigned counsel plans, preferably at the direction of the court system. \nRespectfully submitted, \nKlaus Eppler \n\nAdditional Commentary of Hon. Patricia D. Marks In Which \nHon. Penelope Clute, Hon. Sallie Manzanet, Laurie Shanks And Steven Zeidman Join \nThe Indigent Defense commission was appointed by Chief Judge Kaye in 2004 to \nstudy the indigent defense system from top to bottom and make recommendations for \nimprovement of the indigent defense system.  The inquiry would include the quality of \ncurrent services, the standards for those services, the training of those who represent \nthe indigent and the system for financing these services. The commission would also \ndevelop a model for a whole new system of indigent defense in New York. \nI have reviewed the final report of the commission as of the June 9 meeting and \nfeel compelled to write a separate report. I have been advised that a final report will not \nbe available to review before I leave on Sunday.  While I concur in the Commission's \nreport, I write separately to share my thoughts on what I belieVe is the role of the courts \nin assuring that indigent defendants receive quality representation. I also urge the \nadoption of standards of meaningful representation. \nJUDICIARY ROLE \nI do not feel in the face of information that we have received that we can wait for \nthe creation of a permanent indigent defense commission.  I have been a judge for over \ntwenty years.  For the last eleven years, I have served as the Supervising Judge of the \nCriminal Courts of the Seventh Judicial District.  If a defendant appearing in my \ncourtroom is not being provided with the effective assistance of counsel, then I am \nobligated to intervene and protect that defendant's rights.  Yet many members of this \nCommission seem to believe that the Unified Court System is not under the same \n1 \n\nobligation, even though we have concluded that \"the right to the effective assistance of \ncounsel...is not being provided to a large portion of those who are entitled to it\" \n(Commission Report, p.15).  I refuse to believe that the Judiciary has less of a legal and \nmoral responsibility to protect the rights of indigent criminal defendants than do the \nindividual judges who make up the Judiciary. \nWhile I agree with the main recommendation in our report-the creation of a \npermanent Indigent Defense Commission-- the Judicial Branch cannot just stand back \nand wait for someone else to act while it presides over a system that this Commission \nhas characterized as \"both severely dysfunctional and structurally incapable of providing \neach poor defendant with the effective legal representation that he or she is guaranteed \nby the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution and laws of the State of \nNew York\" ( Interim Report, p. 16).  It is my belief that the lack of involvement of the \ncourts in this area has contributed to many of the problems identified in our reports. \nThe creation of this Commission should be seen as only the first step in the Jud icial \nBranch's aggressive campaign to address a crisis that is being played out in our \ncourtrooms every day.  In my view, it is time for the Executive, Legislative and judicial \nbranches to step forward. \nI strongly urge the creation of a Judicial Office to address indigent defense \nservices and respond in a meaningful way to assure that indigent defendants receive \nquality representation. \nPERFORMANCE STANDARDS \nI believe that a report from this commission should set standards for indigent \n2 \n\ndefense representation. I would propose the following as performance standards to be \nmonitored and enforced by whatever means deemed appropriate by the Chief Judge1\n; \nDEFINITIONS \n. \"Public defense representation\" means legal representation of any person \nfinancially unable to obtain counsel without substantial hardship who is (1) accused of \nan offense, other than a traffic infraction, for which a sentence to a term of \nimprisonment is authorized upon conviction thereof or (2) .E:)ntitlE?d to rElpresentation \nunder article 6-C of the Correction Law or section 259-i of the Executive Law. \n\"Providers of public defense representation\" include individual attorneys; public \ndefender offices; legal aid bureaus or societies; corporations, voluntary associations or \norganizations permitted to practice law under the authority of Judiciary Law § 495 (7); \nand assigned counsel plans. \n\"Institutional providers of public defense representation\" are those providers of \nindigent defense representation identified in County Law §§ 722(1) and (2), including \npublic defenders; legal aid bureaus or societies; any corporation, voluntary association \nor organization permitted t6 practice law under the authority of JudiCiary Law §  495 \n(7).  An assigned counsel plan is not an \"institutional provider of public defense \nrepresentation. \" \n\"Assigned counsel plan\" means a plan for the assignment of private attorneys \npursuant to County Law § 722 (3). \n\"Assigned counsel\" are private attorneys assigned to provide public defense \nrepresentation pursuant to County Law §  722 (3). \nA.  INDEPENDENCE \n1.  The function of providing public defense representation, including the \nselection, funding and payment of counsel, must be independent.  In the performance \nof their legal duties, providers of public defense representation shOUld be free from \npOlitical influence or any influence other than the interests of the client, and should be \nlThese standards are from the staff and I believe that they are based on the NYSBA \nstandards but I would note that they do not include standards of representation in Specialty \ncourts SUch as drug courts. \"Critical Issues for Defense Attorneys in Drug Court\" published by \nthe National Drug Court Institute begins to address such issues. \n3 \n\nsubject to judicial supervision only in the same manner and to the same extent as all \nother practicing lawyers.  The selection of providers of public defense representation, \nincluding the head of any institutional provider of public defense representation, shall \nbe made solely on the basis of merit. \nB.  EARLY ENTRY OF REPRESENTATION \n1.  Effective representation should be available for every eligible person \nwhenever counsel is requested during government investigation or when the individual \nis in custody.  Provision of counsel shall not be delayed while a person's eligibility for \npublic defense representation is being determined or verified. \n2.  Eligible persons shall have counsel available for any court appearance. \n3.  Counsel shall be available when a person reasonably believes that a \nprocess will commence which could result in a proceeding where representation is \nmandated. \n4.  Institutional providers of public defense representation are encouraged, \nwhenever possible, to make counsel available to arrested or charged defendants even \nbefore formal commencement of the criminal action. \nC.  QUALIFICATIONS OF COUNSEL \n1.  Attorneys who provide public defense representation must have sufficient \nqualifications arid experience to enable them to render excellent. representation to \ntheir clients in each particular case.  Providers of public defense representation shall \nnever allow an attorney to accept a case if that attorney lacks the experience or \ntraining to handle it competently unless the attorney is associated with another \nattorney on the case who does possess the necessary experience and training. \nD.  TRAINING \n1.  All attorneys and staff who provide public defense representation must be \nprovided with continuing legal education and training sufficient to ensure that their \nskills and knowledge of the substantive and procedural law and ethical rules relevant \nto the area of law in which they practice .are sufficient to enable them to provide \nexcellent representation. \nE.  SUPPORT SERVICES AND FACILITIES \n1.  Public defense counsel must be provided with the investigative, expert, \nsocial work, secretarial, foreign language interpretation and other support services and \nfacilities necessary to provide high-quality legal representation. \n4 \n\n2.  All providers of public defense representation must have adequate working \nspace for each attomey and staff member, private office and conference room space \nin which attorneys can meet with clients, sufficient library facilities and/or access to \nonline legal. research materials, and computers and other necessary technical and \ncommunication equipment \n3.  All institutional providers of public defense services shall maintain a ratio of \none investigator, secretary and paralegal for every three staff attorneys. \nF.  ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP \nA public defense attorney must: \n1.  Communicate with his or her clienton a reguliir basis during the course of \nrepresentation, preferably in person.  Such communications should be private.  The \nattorney should respond promptly to the client's mail inquiries, and should have the \ncapacity to accept collect calls from clients.  In no event shOUld public defense lawyers \nplace \"blocks\" on their telephones to avoid receiving client phone calls from jail. \n2.  Communicate with family or friends of the client, to the extent that the client \nwaives the attorney-client privilege as to such communication. \n3.  Inform the client on a regular basis of the progress of the case. \n4.  Ensure that the client receives copies of all documents prepared or received \nby the attorney. \nS.  Provide the client with the opportunity to make an intelligent and \nwell-informed decision in those instances when such decision is to be made by the \nclient (Le., whether to plead guilty, whether to be tried by a jury or judge, whether to \ntestify, and whether to appeal). \n6.  Abide by the Disciplinary Rules of the Code of Professional Responsibility \n(Part 1200 of Title 22, of the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations), and in \nparticular those Disciplinary Rules concarning conflicts of interest (§§ 1200.20, \n1200.24, 1200.26 and 1200.27) . \nG.  CONTINUITY OF REPRESENTATION \n1.  To the greatest extent possible, the same attorney should represent a client \ncontinuously from the inception of the representation until the initiation of the appellate \nprocaeding, if any, unless a court determines that (a) there is a conflict of interest;(b) \nthere has been a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship which interferes with \ncounsel's ability to provide zealous, effective and high-quality representation; or (c) \n5 \n\nsome unforeseen circumstance, such as illness, prevents counsel from continuing to \nprovide zealous, effective and high-quality representation. \n2.  When a client has multiple pending proceedings, the attorney on anyone of \nthem shall immediately and thereafter regularly communicate with the attorney(s) on \nthe other matter(s), to the extent that the client waives the attorney-cHent privilege as \nto such communication.  If feasible, and with the approval of the client, the attorneys \nshall make every effort to transfer the representation on all pending matters to a single \nattorney. \n3.  Counse.1 assigned at the appellate or post-conviction stage shall provide \ncontinuity of representation during that proceeding. \n4.  Under no circumstances may any attorney who has represented a person \npursuant to assignment to provide mandated legal representation accept any payment \nwhatsoever on behalf of the client in connection with the matter that is the subject of \nthe assignment. \n5.  Institutional providers of public defense representation are encouraged to \nprovide holistic services to the greatest extent possible. \nH.  QUALITY OF REPRESENTATION \nNo attorney shall accept a criminal case unless that attorney can provide, and \nis confident that he or she can provide, zealous, effective and high-quality \nrepresentation.  Such representation at the trial court stage requires, at a minimum: \n1.  Obtaining all available information concerning the client's background and \ncircumstances for purposes of (a) obtaining the client's pretrial release on the most \nfavorable terms possible; (b) negotiating the most favorable pretrial disposition \npOSSible, if such a disposition is in the client's interests; (c) presenting character \nevidence at trial if appropriate; (d) advocating for the lowest legally permissible \nsentence, if that becomes nepessary; and (e) avoiding or minimizing, if at all possible, \nany potential collateral consequences of the conviction or the charge. \n2.

Counsel has a continuing obligation to stay abreast of changes and \ndevelopments in the law. \n4.  Preserving the client's options at all stages of the proceedings, including (a) \nto seek a jury trial; (b) to proffer a defense; (c) to seek dismissal of the indictment; (d) \nto seek dismissal of the charges for denial of statutory or constitutional speedy trial \nrights; (e) to seek preclusion or suppression of evidence; (f) to seek discovery, \nexculpatory information and impeaching material; and (g) to seek an appropriate \ndisposition consistent with the client's best interests and instructions. \n5.  Providing the client with full information concerning such matters as (a) \npotential defenses and their viability; (b) the weaknesses in the People's case; (c) plea \noffers; (d) potential sentencing exposure, including the relationship of all potential \nsentences to any other sentences, potential release dates, or available correctional \nprograms; and (e) all direct and potential collateral consequences, including those \n. concerning immigration, housing, employment, education, family, licensure, civic \nparticipation, government benefits, and financial penalties.  No guilty plea should be \ntaken without an assessment of the potential collateral consequences ofthe plea. \n6.  Ensuring that a foreign language interpreter is present at every court \nappearance of a client not proficient in English, and that a sign language interpreter is \npresent at every court appearance of a hearing-impaired client in need of such \nservices, and objecting to the court's going forward with any court proceeding until \nsuch interpreter is provided. \n7.  Filing appropriate pretrial motions for, among other things, (a) dismissal of \nthe charging instrument for facial or evidentiary insufficiency; (b) joinder or severance; \n(c) dismissal of the charges for denial of statutory or constitutional speedy trial rights; \n(d) suppression or preclusion of evidence; and (e) provision of additional resources \nnot otherwise available \nbecause of the client's financial circumstances.

Filing appropriate responses to motions, including motions in limine, brought \nby the People. \n9.  In the event of, and in advance of, trial, (a) developing a legal and factual \nstrategy, using whatever investigative and forensic resources are appropriate; (b) \npreparing to select a jury; (c) preparing for cross examination of the People's \nwitnesses and direct examination of defense witnesses; (d) developing a foundation \nfor the introduction of defense evidence and for objecting to inadmissible evidence \noffered by the People; (e) formulating an opening statement; (f) crafting an effective \n7 \n\nsummation; and (f) drafting requests for jury instructions. \n10.

APPEALS \nZealous, effective and high-quality representation at the appellate stage means, \nat a minimum: \n1.  Obtaining and reviewing all portions of the record. \n2.  Researching the applicable law, including substantive law, procedural law \nand rules regarding the appeal. \n3.  Pursuing all appropriate post-conviction remedies. \n4.  Strategically selecting among the issues presented by the facts, considering \nthe strength of authority, the facts, and the standard and scope of review.  The \nselection of issues must be made with an awareness of the consequences for later \npost-conviction proceedings. \n5.  Preparing a statement of facts that accurately sets out the significant and \nrelevant facts, with supporting record citations. \n6.  Presenting legal arguments that apply the most relevant and persuasive law \nto the facts of the case. \n8 \n\n7.  Writing in a clear, cogent and persuasive manner. \n8.

SUPERVISION AND EVALUATION \n1.  All institutional providers of public defense services shall maintain a ratio of \none supervisor for every ten staff attorneys. \n2.  The performance of each attorney and support staff shall be evaluated \nannually, by written evaluation complied by the attorney's supervisor. \n3.  Every public defense attorney assigned to carry a general caseload shall \nconduct a sufficient number of hearings and trials to maintain proficiency in criminal \ndefense litigation.  It shall be the responsibility of the attorney's supervisor to ensure \nthat each attorney maintains a sufficiently active litigation practice as evidenced by a \ndemonstrated ability and willingness to take appropriate cases to hearing and trial. \nK.  CASELOAD \n1.  Under no circumstances shall a public defense attorney annually handle \nmore than 150 felonies, 400 misdemeanors, or 25 appellate aSSignments, as the case \nmaybe. \n2.  These caps should be appropriately weighted and adjusted for attorneys \nwho handle both misdemeanors and felonies, or both trial-level cases and appeals. \n3.  No attorney employed by an institutional provider of public defense \nrepresentation shall be permitted to maintain a private law practice.) \n9 \n\nSuch standards should also include performance and caseload standards for defense \nattorneys representing clients in problem solving courts. \nI conclude by expressing my gratitude to Judge Kaye for appointing me to this \ncommission. It was a terrific learning experience. I also express my appreciation to the \nstaff who enthusiastically provided support and information throughout the process \nspecifically John Amodeo, Paul Lewis, Robert Mandelbaum and David Markus. They \nwere smart, resourceful, and  respectful. It was a pleasure to work with them. \nRespectfully submitted, \nPatricia D. Marks \nSupervising Judge Criminal Courts \nSeventh judicial District \n10 ",

Scott of counsel), for County of Onondaga and others,\nrespondents.\n__________\n\n-2- 509581 \nPeters, J.P.\nAppeal from an order of the Supreme Court (Devine, J.),\nentered July 13, 2009 in Albany County, which denied plaintiffs'\nmotion for class action certification. \nPlaintiffs, who at the time had criminal charges pending\nagainst them in defendants Onondaga, Ontario, Schuyler, Suffolk\nand Washington Counties (hereinafter collectively referred to as\nthe counties), commenced this putative class action alleging that\nthe current system of public defense is systemically deficient\nand poses a grave risk that indigent criminal defendants are\nbeing or will be denied their constitutional right to counsel. \nThey sought, among other things, a declaration that their\nconstitutional rights and those of the class are being violated\nand an injunction requiring defendants to provide a system of\npublic defense consistent with those guarantees.  On a prior\nappeal, this Court found, by a plurality, that the complaint\nalleged only nonjusticiable claims of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel and granted defendant State of New York's motion to\ndismiss (66 AD3d 84 [2009]).  The Court of Appeals subsequently\nmodified this Court's order and reinstated a portion of the\ncomplaint, concluding that plaintiffs stated a claim for both\nactual and \"constructive\" denial of the right to counsel under\nGideon v Wainwright (372 US 335 [1963]) and that such systemic\nclaims are justiciable in a collateral civil action seeking\nprospective relief (15 NY3d 8, 22-23 [2010]).\nIn the meantime, plaintiffs moved for class action\ncertification, seeking certification of a class of \n\"[a]ll indigent persons who have or will\nhave criminal felony, misdemeanor, or\nlesser charges pending against them in New\nYork state courts in Onondaga, Ontario,\nSchuyler, Suffolk and Washington counties\nwho are entitled to rely on the government\nof New York to provide them with\nmeaningful and effective defense counsel.\" \nSupreme Court denied the motion, finding that plaintiffs had\n\n-3- 509581 \nfailed to demonstrate that they would fairly and adequately\nprotect the interests of the entire class and that a class action\nwas superior to other available methods for resolving the claims. \nPlaintiffs appeal and we reverse. \nIn order to obtain class action certification, a party must\nestablish that: \n\"1. the class is so numerous that joinder\nof all members, whether otherwise required\nor permitted, is impracticable; 2. there\nare questions of law or fact common to the\nclass which predominate over any questions\naffecting only individual members; 3. the\nclaims or defenses of the representative\nparties are typical of the claims or\ndefenses of the class; 4. the\nrepresentative parties will fairly and\nadequately protect the interests of the\nclass; and 5. a class action is superior\nto other available methods for the fair\nand efficient adjudication of the\ncontroversy\" (CPLR 901 [a]). \nSignificantly, these criteria must be liberally construed and\n\"any error, if there is to be one, should be . . . in favor of\nallowing the class action\" (Pruitt v Rockefeller Ctr. Props., 167\nAD2d 14, 21 [1991] [internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted]; accord Lauer v New York Tel. Co., 231 AD2d 126, 130\n[1997]; see Liechtung v Tower Air, 269 AD2d 363, 364 [2000];\nFriar v Vanguard Holding Corp., 78 AD2d 83, 91 [1980]). \nFurthermore, while the determination as to whether a lawsuit\nqualifies as a class action rests within the sound discretion of\nthe trial court, we are vested with a corresponding power to\nsubstitute our own discretion for that of the trial court, even\nin the absence of an abuse of that discretion (see City of New\nYork v Maul, 14 NY3d 499, 509 [2010]; Small v Lorillard Tobacco\nCo., 94 NY2d 43, 52-53 [1999]).\nFollowing these principles, and guided by the Court of\nAppeals' articulation of plaintiffs' claim subsequent to Supreme\n\n-4- 509581 \nCourt's determination, we find that plaintiffs satisfied all of\nthe prerequisites to class action certification.  There can be no\nserious dispute that the proposed class, consisting of\npotentially tens of thousands of individuals, meets the\nnumerosity requirement (see CPLR 901 [a] [1]).  Furthermore,\ncommon questions of law and fact predominate over questions\naffecting only individual class members (see CPLR 901 [a] [2]). \nSignificantly, the Court of Appeals dismissed the complaint to\nthe extent that it was premised on performance based claims of\nineffective assistance of counsel, thereby obviating any need to\nconduct individualized inquiries into the performance of the\nclass members' individual attorneys.  With only the claims of\n\"outright\" and \"constructive denial\" of the right to counsel at a\ncritical stage of the criminal proceeding remaining (15 NY3d at\n22-23), the \"basic, unadorned question presented [in this action]\nis whether the State has met its obligation to provide counsel\"\n(id. at 23).  That is, the inquiry distills to whether, \"in one\nor more of the five counties at issue[,] the basic constitutional\nmandate for the provision of counsel to indigent defendants at\nall critical stages is at risk of being unmet because of systemic\nconditions\" (id. at 25).  It is this concrete legal issue, and\nthe constitutional right to counsel sought to be vindicated, that\nis common to all members of the class and transcends any\nindividual questions.  That the class members may have suffered\nthe deprivation of their constitutional right to counsel in\nvarying manners – be it through outright denial of counsel during\narraignment or a bail hearing, or nonrepresentation at a critical\nstage — does not compel a conclusion that individual issues\npredominate; \"it is 'predominance, not identity or unanimity,'\nthat is the linchpin of commonality\" (City of New York v Maul, 14\nNY3d at 514, quoting Friar v Vanguard Holding Corp., 78 AD2d at\n98; see Fleming v Barnwell Nursing Home & Health Facilities, 309\nAD2d 1132, 1133-1134 [2003]).  Likewise, \"the fact that questions\npeculiar to each individual may remain after resolution of the\ncommon questions is not fatal to the class action\" (City of New\nYork v Maul, 14 NY3d at 514 [internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted]).  Additionally, inasmuch as the named\nplaintiffs' claims derive from the same course of conduct that\ngives rise to the claims of the other class members and is based\nupon the same legal theory (see Super Glue Corp. v Avis Rent A\nCar Sys., 132 AD2d 604, 607 [1987]; Friar v Vanguard Holding\n\n-5- 509581 \nCorp., 78 AD2d at 99), the prerequisite of typicality is also\nsatisfied (see CPLR 901 [a] [3]).\nMoreover, plaintiffs have demonstrated that the\nrepresentative parties would fairly and adequately protect the\ninterests of the entire class (see CPLR 901 [a] [4]).  Plaintiffs\nsubmitted evidence that class counsel is highly experienced in\nclass action litigation and has sufficient resources available to\nadequately protect and represent the class (see City of New York\nv Maul, 59 AD3d 187, 190 [2009], affd 14 NY3d 499 [2010]; Globe\nSurgical Supply v GEICO Ins. Co., 59 AD3d 129, 144 [2008]). \nFurthermore, affidavits from the named plaintiffs established\nthat they are familiar with the litigation and understand the\nissues involved, and several of the representative plaintiffs\nalso indicated that they joined in the lawsuit not in an effort\nto alter the outcomes of their individual cases, but in order to\nimprove the indigent defense system.  The fact that the criminal\ncases of the named plaintiffs have terminated does not, in our\nview, suggest that they will not adequately pursue the action\n(cf. United States Parole Commn. v Geraghty, 445 US 388, 397-400\n[1980]).  \nNor do we perceive a potential conflict of interest between\nplaintiffs and members of the proposed class.  In finding\notherwise, Supreme Court reasoned that plaintiffs' failure to\npursue a damages claim in this action would bar class members,\nunder principles of res judicata, from subsequently bringing\nindividual legal malpractice claims against their criminal\nattorneys.  However, \"a class action judgment 'will as a rule\nbind only as to matters actually litigated and not necessarily\nthose which merely might have been'\" (Matter of Dvelis v New York\nState Dept. of Social Servs., 146 AD2d 875, 877 [1989], lv denied\n74 NY2d 608 [1989], quoting Siegel, NY Prac § 454, at 600; see\nEliasof v Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 39 AD3d 801, 803 [2007];\ncf. Murphy v Erie County, 28 NY2d 80, 85-86 [1971]).  Here,\nindividualized damage claims related to counsel's performance in\nany given criminal proceeding will not and, in light of the Court\nof Appeals' circumscription of plaintiffs' claim, cannot be\nlitigated in this action.  Accordingly, we fail to find the\nexistence of any conflict of interest and conclude that\nplaintiffs have made a sufficient showing that the representative\n\n-6- 509581 \nplaintiffs will adequately protect the interests of the class. \nFinally, unlike Supreme Court, we find that a class action\nis superior to other available methods for obtaining a fair and\nefficient adjudication of this controversy (see CPLR 901 [a]\n[5]).  Defendants urge, and Supreme Court found, that class\naction certification is unnecessary and unwarranted here in light\nof the government operations rule.  \"That rule cautions against\nclass certification where governmental operations are involved,\nsince any relief granted to the named plaintiffs would adequately\nflow to and protect others similarly situated under principles of\nstare decisis\" (New York City Coalition to End Lead Poisoning v\nGiuliani, 245 AD2d 49, 51 [1997] [citations omitted]; see Matter\nof Martin v Lavine, 39 NY2d 72, 75 [1976]; Matter of Jones v\nBerman, 37 NY2d 42, 57 [1975]; Matter of Legal Aid Socy. v New\nYork City Police Dept., 274 AD2d 207, 213 [2000], lv dismissed\nand denied 95 NY2d 956 [2000]).  While we find a measure of merit\nto the assertion that injunctive relief granted to these 20\nplaintiffs – i.e., the provision of a public defense system that\nensures that indigent criminal defendants receive their\nconstitutionally guaranteed right to counsel – would protect the\nproposed class of indigent defendants in the counties, we\nperceive other compelling concerns weighing in favor of, and thus\nmaking superior, a class action for the purpose of adjudicating\nthis dispute.\nFirst, denial of class certification gives rise to the\npossibility of multiple lawsuits involving claims duplicative of\nthose asserted in this action and inconsistent rulings by various\ncourts in this State (see New York City Coalition to End Lead\nPoisoning v Giuliani, 245 AD2d at 52; Tindell v Koch, 164 AD2d\n689, 695 [1991]).  As noted by the Court of Appeals, \"[w]hen a\nclass seeks to compel certain behavior on the part of an entity,\nwhether it be a governmental agency or a private corporation,\n. . . there is an interest in consolidating the action in a\nsingle forum in order to avoid the possibility of conflicting\njudgments from different jurisdictions which would subject the\ndefendants to varying and possibly inconsistent obligations\"\n(Matter of Colt Indus. Shareholder Litig., 77 NY2d 185, 195\n[1991]).  \n\n-7- 509581 \nWe also find that proceeding in the absence of class action\nstatus would subject the prosecution of this case to significant\ndiscovery challenges.  Plaintiffs claim that their constitutional\nright to counsel, as well as that of all other indigent criminal\ndefendants in the counties, are being systemically denied due to\ndeficiencies in the public defense system.  It follows that, in\norder to prove their claim, plaintiffs will be saddled with the\nenormous task of establishing that deprivations of counsel to\nindigent defendants are not simply isolated occurrences in the\ncase of these 20 plaintiffs, but are a common or routine\nhappenstance in the counties.  Supreme Court found that\nplaintiffs can call current indigent defendants as nonparty\nwitnesses and rely on the histories of their criminal proceedings\nin order to prove their claim, yet, without class action\ncertification, the hurdle of ascertaining the identity of those\nindigent defendants and/or accessing the histories of their\ncriminal proceedings may prove insurmountable.\nFinally, and in our view not insignificantly, our research\nhas failed to identify a single case involving claims of systemic\ndeficiencies which seek widespread, systematic reform that has\nnot been maintained as a class action (see e.g. City of New York\nv Maul, 14 NY3d 499 [2010], supra; Brad H. v City of New York,\n276 AD2d 440 [2000], affg 185 Misc 2d 420 [2000]; New York City\nCoalition to End Lead Poisoning v Giuliani, 245 AD2d 49, 51\n[1997], supra).  Mindful of the liberal construction we must give\nto CPLR article 9, and reiterating that any error should be\nresolved in favor of granting class action certification (see\nLauer v New York Tel. Co., 231 AD2d 126, 130 [1997], supra;\nPruitt v Rockefeller Ctr. Props., 167 AD2d 14, 21 [1991], supra),\nwe conclude that the unique circumstances of this case render a\nclass action superior to other methods of adjudicating this\ncontroversy.\nRose, Malone Jr. and Garry, JJ., concur.\n\n-8- 509581 \nORDERED that the order is reversed, on the facts, with\ncosts, and motion granted.\nENTER:\nRobert D.

Gideon is not\nnow controversial either as an expression of what the\nConstitution requires or as an exercise in elemental fair play. \nSerious questions have, however, arisen in this and other\njurisdictions as to whether Gideon's mandate is being met in\npractice (see e.g., Lavallee v Justices in the Hampden Superior\nCourt, 442 Mass 228 [2004]) . \nIn New York, the Legislature has left the performance\nof the State's obligations under Gideon to the counties, where it\nis discharged, for the most part, with county resources and\naccording to local rules and practices (see County Law articles\n18-A and 18-B).  Plaintiffs in this action, defendants in various\ncriminal prosecutions ongoing at the time of the action's\ncommencement in Washington, Onondaga, Ontario, Schuyler and\nSuffolk counties, contend that this arrangement, involving what\nis in essence a costly, largely unfunded and politically\nunpopular mandate upon local government, has functioned to\ndeprive them and other similarly situated indigent defendants in\nthe aforementioned counties of constitutionally and statutorily\nguaranteed representational rights.  They seek a declaration that\ntheir rights and those of the class they seek to represent are\nbeing violated and an injunction to avert further abridgment of\ntheir right to counsel; they do not seek relief within the\ncriminal cases out of which their claims arise.\nThis appeal results from dispositions of defendants'\n- 2 -\n\n- 3 - No. 66\nmotion pursuant to CPLR 3211 to dismiss the action as non-\njusticiable.  Supreme Court denied the motion, but in the\ndecision and order now before us (66 AD3d 84 [2009]) the sought\nrelief was granted by the Appellate Division.  That Court held\nthat there was no cognizable claim for ineffective assistance of\ncounsel other than one seeking post-conviction relief, and,\nrelatedly, that violation of a criminal defendant's right to\ncounsel could not be vindicated in a collateral civil proceeding,\nparticularly where the object of the collateral action was to\ncompel an additional allocation of public resources, which the\nCourt found to be a properly legislative prerogative.  Two\nJustices dissented.  They were of the view that violations of the\nright to counsel were actionable in contexts other than claims\nfor post-conviction relief, including a civil action such as that\nbrought by plaintiffs.  While recognizing that choices between\ncompeting social priorities are ordinarily for the Legislature, \nthis did not, in the dissenters' judgment, excuse the judiciary\nfrom its obligation to provide a remedy for violations of\nconstitutional rights (id. at 95),  especially when the alleged\nviolations were \"so interwoven with, and necessarily\nimplicate[d], the proper functioning of the court system itself\"\n(at 96).\nPlaintiffs have appealed as of right from the Appellate\nDivision's order pursuant to CPLR 5601 (a) and (b) (1).  We now\nreinstate the action, albeit with some substantial qualifications\n- 3 -\n\n- 4 - No. 66\nupon its scope.\nDefendants' claim that the action is not justiciable\nrests principally on two theories: first, that there is no\ncognizable claim for ineffective assistance of counsel apart from\none seeking relief from a conviction, and second, that\nrecognition of a claim for systemic relief of the sort plaintiffs\nseek will involve the courts in the performance of properly\nlegislative functions, most notably determining how public\nresources are to be allocated.\nThe first of these theories is rooted in case law\nconditioning relief for constitutionally ineffective assistance\nupon findings that attorney performance, when viewed in its\ntotal, case specific aspect, has both fallen below the standard\nof objective reasonableness (see Strickland v Washington, 466 US\n668, 687-688 [1984]), and resulted in prejudice, either with\nrespect to the outcome of the proceeding (id. at 694) or, under\nthis Court's somewhat less outcome oriented standard of\n\"meaningful assistance,\" to the defendant's right to a fair trial\n(People v Benevento, 91 NY2d 708, 713-714 [1998]).  Defendants\nreason that the prescribed, deferential (see Strickland, 466 US\nat 689; Benevento, 91 NY2d at 712) and highly context sensitive\ninquiry into the adequacy and particular effect of counsel's\nperformance, cannot occur until a prosecution has concluded in a\nconviction, and that, once there is a conviction, the appropriate\navenues of relief are direct appeals and the various other\n- 4 -\n\n- 5 - No. 66\nestablished means of challenging a conviction, such as CPL 440\nmotions and petitions for writs of habeas corpus or coram nobis. \nThey urge, in essence, that the present plaintiffs can, based\nupon their ongoing prosecutions, possess no ripe claim of\nineffective assistance and that any ineffective assistance claims\nthat might eventually be brought by them would, given the nature\nof the claim, have to be individually asserted and determined; \nthey argue that a finding of constitutionally deficient\nperformance -- one necessarily rooted in the particular\ncircumstances of an individual case -- cannot serve as a\npredicate for systemic relief.  Indeed, they remind us that the\nSupreme Court in Strickland has noted pointedly that \"the purpose\nof the effective assistance guarantee of the Sixth Amendment is\nnot to improve the quality of legal representation, although that\nis a goal of considerable importance to the legal system[,] . . .\n[but rather] to ensure that criminal defendants receive a fair\ntrial\"  (466 US at 689).\nThese arguments possess a measure of merit.  A fair\nreading of Strickland and our relevant state precedents supports\ndefendants' contention that effective assistance is a judicial\nconstruct designed to do no more than protect an individual\ndefendant's right to a fair adjudication; it is not a concept\ncapable of expansive application to remediate systemic\ndeficiencies.  The cases in which the concept has been explicated\nare in this connection notable for their intentional omission of\n- 5 -\n\n- 6 - No. 66\nany broadly applicable defining performance standards.  Indeed,\nStrickland is clear that articulation of any standard more\nspecific than that of objective reasonableness is neither\nwarranted by the Sixth Amendment nor compatible with its\nobjectives:\n\"More specific guidelines are not\nappropriate. The Sixth Amendment refers\nsimply to 'counsel,' not specifying\nparticular requirements of effective\nassistance. It relies instead on the legal\nprofession's maintenance of standards\nsufficient to justify the law's presumption\nthat counsel will fulfill the role in the\nadversary process that the Amendment\nenvisions. The proper measure of attorney\nperformance remains simply reasonableness\nunder prevailing professional norms ... In\nany case presenting an ineffectiveness claim,\nthe performance inquiry must be whether\ncounsel's assistance was reasonable\nconsidering all the circumstances ... No\nparticular set of detailed rules for\ncounsel's conduct can satisfactorily take\naccount of the variety of circumstances faced\nby defense counsel or the range of legitimate\ndecisions regarding how best to represent a\ncriminal defendant. Any such set of rules\nwould interfere with the constitutionally\nprotected independence of counsel and\nrestrict the wide latitude counsel must have\nin making tactical decisions. Indeed, the\nexistence of detailed guidelines for\nrepresentation could distract counsel from\nthe overriding mission of vigorous advocacy\nof the defendant's cause\"\n(466 US at 688-689 [internal citations omitted]).  We too have\nfor similar reasons eschewed the articulation of more specific,\ngenerally applicable performance standards for judging the\neffectiveness of counsel in the context of determining whether\nconstitutionally mandated representation has been provided (see\n- 6 -\n\n- 7 - No. 66\nPeople v Benevento, 91 NY at 712; People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137,\n146-147 [1981]).  This is not to say that performance standards\nare not highly relevant in assuring that constitutionally\neffective assistance is provided and in judging whether in a\nparticular case an attorney's performance has been deficient,\nonly that such standards do not and cannot usefully define the\nSixth Amendment-based concept of effective assistance.  While the\nimposition of such standards may be highly salutary, it is not\nunder Strickland appropriate as an exercise in Sixth Amendment\njurisprudence.  \nHaving said this, however, we would add the very\nimportant caveat that Strickland's approach is expressly premised\non the supposition that the fundamental underlying right to\nrepresentation under Gideon has been enabled by the State in a\nmanner that would justify the presumption that the standard of\nobjective reasonableness will ordinarily be satisfied (see\nStrickland, 466 US at 687-689, supra).  The questions properly\nraised in this Sixth Amendment-grounded action, we think, go not\nto whether ineffectiveness has assumed systemic dimensions, but\nrather to whether the State has met its foundational obligation\nunder Gideon to provide legal representation.\nInasmuch as general prescriptive relief is unavailable\nand indeed incompatible with the adjudication of claims alleging\nconstitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel, it follows\nthat plaintiffs' claims for prospective systemic relief cannot\n- 7 -\n\n- 8 - No. 66\nstand if their gravamen is only that attorneys appointed for them\nhave not, so far, afforded them meaningful and effective\nrepresentation.  While it is defendants' position, and was\nevidently that of the Appellate Division majority, that the\ncomplaint contains only performance-based claims for ineffective\nassistance, our examination of the pleading leads us to a\ndifferent conclusion.\nAccording to the complaint, ten of the 20 plaintiffs --\ntwo from Washington, two from Onondaga, two from Ontario and four\nfrom Schuyler County -- were altogether without representation at\nthe arraignments held in their underlying criminal proceedings. \nEight of these unrepresented plaintiffs were jailed after bail\nhad been set in amounts they could not afford.  It is alleged\nthat the experience of these plaintiffs is illustrative of what\nis a fairly common practice in the aforementioned counties of\narraigning defendants without counsel and leaving them,\nparticularly when accused of relatively low level offenses,\nunrepresented in subsequent proceedings where pleas are taken and\nother critically important legal transactions take place.   One\nof these plaintiffs remained unrepresented for some five months \nand it is alleged that the absence of clear and uniform\nguidelines reasonably related to need has commonly resulted in\ndenials of representation to indigent defendants based on the\nsubjective judgments of individual jurists.\nIn addition to the foregoing allegations of outright\n- 8 -\n\n- 9 - No. 66\nnon-representation, the complaint contains allegations to the\neffect that although lawyers were eventually nominally appointed\nfor plaintiffs, they were unavailable to their clients -- that\nthey conferred with them little, if at all, were often completely\nunresponsive to their urgent inquiries and requests from jail,\nsometimes for months on end, waived important rights without\nconsulting them, and ultimately appeared to do little more on\ntheir behalf than act as conduits for plea offers, some of which\npurportedly were highly unfavorable.  It is repeatedly alleged\nthat counsel missed court appearances, and that when they did\nappear they were not prepared to proceed, often because they were\nentirely new to the case, the matters having previously been\nhandled by other similarly unprepared counsel.1  There are also\nallegations that the counsel appointed for at least one of the\nplaintiffs was seriously conflicted and thus unqualified to\nundertake the representation.\nThe allegations of the complaint must at this stage of\nthe litigation be deemed true and construed in plaintiffs' favor,\naffording them the benefit of every reasonable inference (Leon v\nMartinez, 84 NY2d 83, 87-88 [1994]), the very limited object\nbeing to ascertain whether any cognizable claim for relief is\nmade out (id.).  If there is a discernible claim, that is where\nthe inquiry must end; the difficulty of its proof is not the\n1This claim, referred by plaintiffs as one based on \"lack of\nconsistent vertical representation\" is raised by each of the four\nSuffolk County plaintiffs.\n- 9 -\n\n- 10 - No. 66\npresent concern.  The above summarized allegations, in our view, \nstate cognizable Sixth Amendment claims.\nIt is clear that a criminal defendant, regardless of\nwherewithal, is entitled to \"'the guiding hand of counsel at\nevery step in the proceedings against him'\" (Gideon v Wainwright,\n372 US at 345, quoting Powell v Alabama, 287 US 45, 68-69\n[1932]). The right attaches at arraignment (see Rothgery v\nGillespie County, __ US __, 128 S Ct 2578 [2008]) and entails the\npresence of counsel at each subsequent \"critical\" stage of the\nproceedings (Montejo v Louisiana, __ US __, 129 S Ct 2079\n[2009]). As is here relevant, arraignment itself must under the\ncircumstances alleged be deemed a critical stage since, even if\nguilty pleas were not then elicited from the presently named\nplaintiffs,2 a circumstance which would undoubtedly require the\n\"critical stage\" label (see Coleman v Alabama, 399 US 1, 9\n[1970]), it is clear from the complaint that plaintiffs' pretrial\nliberty interests were on that occasion regularly adjudicated\n(see also CPL 180.10 [6]) with most serious consequences, both\ndirect and collateral, including the loss of employment and\nhousing, and inability to support and care for particularly needy\ndependents.  There is no question that \"a bail hearing is a\ncritical stage of the State's criminal process\" (Higazy v FBI\nAgent Michael Templeton, 505 F3d 161, 172 [2d Cir 2007] [internal\n2It is, however, alleged that in the counties at issue pleas\nare often elicited from unrepresented defendants at arraignment.\n- 10 -\n\n- 11 - No. 66\nquotation marks and citation omitted]).  \nRecognizing the crucial importance of arraignment and\nthe extent to which a defendant's basic liberty and due process\ninterests may then be affected, CPL 180.10 (3) expressly provides\nfor \"the right to the aid of counsel at the arraignment and at\nevery subsequent stage of the action\" and forbids a court from\ngoing forward with the proceeding without counsel for the\ndefendant, unless the defendant has knowingly agreed to proceed\nin counsel's absence (CPL 180.10 [5]).3   Contrary to defendants'\nsuggestion and that of the dissent, nothing in the statute may be\nread to justify the conclusion that the presence of defense\ncounsel at arraignment is ever dispensable, except at a\ndefendant's informed option, when matters affecting the\ndefendant's pretrial liberty or ability subsequently to defend\nagainst the charges are to be decided.  Nor is there merit to\ndefendants' suggestion that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel\nis not yet fully implicated (see Rothgery, 128 S Ct at 2589).  \nThe cases cited by the dissent in which the allegedly\nconsequential event at arraignment was the entry of a not guilty\nplea (United States ex rel. Caccio v Fay, 350 F2d 214, 215 [2d\n3It does not appear that any of the plaintiffs who were\narraigned without counsel and jailed when they could not afford\nthe bail consequently fixed, agreed to proceed without a lawyer.  \nThe dissent's assertion (fn 7) that plaintiffs were not \"forced\"\nto participate in bail hearings without counsel, is, apart from\nbeing without any support in the record, irrelevant given the\nclear entitlement to counsel under the statute, and indeed the\nConstitution. \n- 11 -\n\n- 12 - No. 66\nCir 1965]; United States ex rel. Combs v Denno, 357 F2d 809, 812\n[2d Cir 1966]; United States ex rel Hussey v Fay, 220 F Supp 562\n[SD NY 1963]; Holland v Allard, 2005 WL 2786909 [ED NY 2005]), do\nnot stand for the  proposition that counsel, as a general matter,\nis optional at arraignment.  Indeed, such a proposition would\nplainly be untenable since arraignments routinely, and in New\nYork as a matter of statutory design, encompass matters affecting\na defendant's liberty and ability to defend against the charges. \nThe cited cases rather stand for the very limited proposition\nthat where it happens that what occurs at arraignment does not\naffect a defendant's ultimate adjudication, a defendant is not on\nthe ground of non-representation entitled to a reversal of his or\nher conviction.  Plaintiffs here do not seek that relief. \nRather, they seek prospectively to assure the provision of what\nthe Constitution undoubtedly guarantees -- representation at all\ncritical stages of the criminal proceedings.  In New York,\narraignment is, as a general matter, such a stage.\nAlso \"critical\" for Sixth Amendment purposes is the\nperiod between arraignment and trial when a case must be\nfactually developed and researched, decisions respecting Grand\nJury testimony made, plea negotiations conducted, and pre-trial\nmotions filed.  Indeed, it is clear that \"to deprive a person of\ncounsel during the period prior to trial may be more damaging\nthan denial of counsel during the trial itself\" (Maine v Moulton,\n474 US 159, 170 [1985]).\n- 12 -\n\n- 13 - No. 66\nThis complaint contains numerous plain allegations that\nin specific cases counsel simply was not provided at critical\nstages of the proceedings.  The complaint additionally contains\nallegations sufficient to justify the inference that these\ndeprivations may be illustrative of significantly more widespread\npractices; of particular note in this connection are the\nallegations that in numerous cases representational denials are\npremised on subjective and highly variable notions of indigency,\nraising possible due process and equal protection concerns. \nThese allegations state a claim, not for ineffective assistance\nunder Strickland, but for basic denial of the right to counsel\nunder Gideon.\nSimilarly, while variously interpretable, the numerous\nallegations to the effect that counsel, although appointed, were\nuncommunicative, made virtually no efforts on their nominal\nclients' behalf during the very critical period subsequent to\narraignment, and, indeed, waived important rights without\nauthorization from their clients, may be reasonably understood to\nallege non-representation rather than ineffective representation. \nActual representation assumes a certain basic representational\nrelationship.  The allegations here, however, raise serious\nquestions as to whether any such relationship may be really said\nto have existed between many of the plaintiffs and their putative\nattorneys and cumulatively may be understood to raise the\ndistinct possibility that merely nominal attorney-client pairings\n- 13 -\n\n- 14 - No. 66\noccur in subject counties with a fair degree of regularity,\nallegedly because of inadequate funding and staffing of indigent\ndefense providers.  It is very basic that\n\"If no actual 'Assistance' 'for' the\naccused's 'defence' is provided, then the\nconstitutional guarantee has been violated.\nTo hold otherwise 'could convert the\nappointment of counsel into a sham and\nnothing more than a formal compliance with\nthe Constitution's requirement that an\naccused be given the assistance of counsel.\nThe Constitution's guarantee of assistance of\ncounsel cannot be satisfied by mere formal\nappointment.' Avery v. Alabama, 308 U.S. 444,\n446, 60 S. Ct. 321, 322, 84 L. Ed. 377\n(1940)\"\n(United States v Cronic, 466 US 648, 654-655 [1984] [footnote\nomitted]).\nWhile it may turn out after further factual development\nthat what is really at issue is whether the representation\nafforded was effective -- a subject not properly litigated in\nthis civil action -- at this juncture, construing the allegations\nbefore us as we must, in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,\nthe complaint states a claim for constructive denial of the right\nto counsel by reason of insufficient compliance with the\nconstitutional mandate of Gideon.4   The dissent's conclusion\nthat these allegations assert only performance based claims, and\nnot claims for non-representation, seems to us premature.  The\npicture which emerges from a fair and procedurally appropriate\n4We note that Cronic is careful to distinguish this distinct\nclaim from one for ineffective assistance (Cronic, 466 US at 654\nn 11). \n- 14 -\n\n- 15 - No. 66\nreading of the complaint, is that defendants are with some\nregularity going unrepresented at arraignment and subsequent\ncritical stages.   As noted, half the plaintiffs claim to have\nbeen without counsel at arraignment, and nearly all claim to have\nbeen left effectively without representation for lengthy periods\nsubsequent to arraignment.  If all that were involved was a\n\"lumping together of 20 generic ineffective assistance of counsel\nclaims,\" (dissent at 6) we would agree with the dissent that no\ncognizable claim had been stated, but we do not think that this\ndetailed, multi-tiered complaint meticulously setting forth the\nfactual bases of the individual claims and the manner in which\nthey are linked to and illustrative of broad systemic\ndeficiencies, is susceptible of such characterization.   \nCollateral preconviction claims seeking prospective\nrelief for absolute, core denials of the right to the assistance\nof counsel cannot be understood to be incompatible with\nStrickland.  These are not the sort of contextually sensitive\nclaims that are typically involved when ineffectiveness is\nalleged.  The basic, unadorned question presented by such claims\nwhere as here the defendant-claimants are poor, is whether the\nState has met its obligation to provide counsel, not whether\nunder all the circumstances counsel's performance was inadequate\nor prejudicial.  Indeed, in cases of outright denial of the right\nto counsel prejudice is presumed.   Strickland itself, of course,\nrecognizes the critical distinction between a claim for\n- 15 -\n\n- 16 - No. 66\nineffective assistance and one alleging simply that the right to\nthe assistance of counsel has been denied and specifically\nacknowledges that the latter kind of claim may be disposed of\nwithout inquiring as to prejudice:\n\"In certain Sixth Amendment contexts,\nprejudice is presumed. Actual or constructive\ndenial of the assistance of counsel\naltogether is legally presumed to result in\nprejudice. So are various kinds of state\ninterference with counsel's assistance. See\nUnited States v. Cronic, 466 U.S., at 659,\nand n. 25, 104 S.Ct., at 2046-2047, and n.\n25. Prejudice in these circumstances is so\nlikely that case-by-case inquiry into\nprejudice is not worth the cost. 466 U.S., at\n658, 104 S.Ct., at 2046. Moreover, such\ncircumstances involve impairments of the\nSixth Amendment right that are easy to\nidentify and, for that reason and because the\nprosecution is directly responsible, easy for\nthe government to prevent\"\n(466 US at 692).  \nThe allegations before us state claims falling\nprecisely within this described category.  It is true, as the\ndissent points out, that claims, even within this category, have\nbeen most frequently litigated post-conviction, but it does not\nfollow from this circumstance that they are not cognizable apart\nfrom the post-conviction context.  Given the simplicity and\nautonomy of a claim for non-representation, as opposed to one\ntruly involving the adequacy of an attorney's performance, there\nis no reason -- and certainly none is identified in the dissent -\n- why such a claim can not or should not be brought without the\ncontext of a completed prosecution. \n- 16 -\n\n- 17 - No. 66\nAlthough defendants contend otherwise, we perceive no\nreal danger that allowing these claims to proceed would impede\nthe orderly progress of plaintiffs' underlying criminal actions. \nThose actions have, for the most part been concluded,5 and we\nhave, in any event, removed from the action the issue of\nineffective assistance, thus eliminating any possibility that the\ncollateral adjudication of generalized claims of ineffective\nassistance might be used to obtain relief from individual\njudgments of conviction.6  Here we emphasize that our recognition\nthat plaintiffs may have claims for constructive denial of\ncounsel should not be viewed as a back door for what would be\nnon-justiciable assertions of ineffective assistance seeking\nremedies specifically addressed to attorney performance, such as\nuniform hiring, training and practice standards.  To the extent\n5Defendants' contention that the action is, in light of this\ncircumstance, moot overlooks the well-established exception to\nthe mootness doctrine for recurring claims of public importance\ntypically evading review (see Matter of Hearst Corp. v Clyne, 50\nNY2d 707, 714-715 [1980]). \n6It follows that if plaintiffs' claims are found to be\nmeritorious after trial, such a determination will not entitle\nthem to vacatur of their criminal convictions.  And, although the\nissue is not specifically raised, we note in the same connection\nthat, in view of the circumstance that this action will not\ndisturb the progress or outcomes of plaintiffs' criminal actions\n(cf. Matter of Lipari v Owens, 70 NY2d 731 [1987]; Matter of\nVeloz v Rothwax, 65 NY2d 902 [1985]), and that the action seeks\nrelief largely unavailable in the context of the underlying\nindividual criminal actions, the rule generally applicable to bar\ncollateral claims for equitable intervention in ongoing criminal\nprosecutions (see e.g. Kelly's Rental v City of New York,44 NY2d\n700 [1978]) would not be properly relied upon by the State here. \n- 17 -\n\n- 18 - No. 66\nthat a cognizable Sixth Amendment claim is stated in this\ncollateral civil action, it is to the effect that in one or more\nof the five counties at issue the basic constitutional mandate\nfor the provision of counsel to indigent defendants at all\ncritical stages is at risk of being left unmet because of\nsystemic conditions, not by reason of the personal failings and\npoor professional decisions of individual attorneys.  While the\ndefense of indigents in the five subject counties might perhaps\nbe improved in many ways that the Legislature is free to explore,\nthe much narrower focus of the constitutionally based judicial\nremedy here sought must be simply to assure that every indigent\ndefendant is afforded actual assistance of counsel, as Gideon\ncommands.  Plainly, we do not, even while narrowing the scope of\nthis action as we believe the law requires, deny plaintiffs a\nremedy for systemic violations of Gideon, as the dissent\nsuggests.  It is rather the dissent that would foreclose\nplaintiffs from any prospect of obtaining such relief.  And, when\nall is said and done, the dissent's proposed denial is premised\nsolely upon the availability of relief from a judgment of\nconviction.  Neither law, nor logic, nor sound public policy\ndictates that one form of relief should be preclusive of the\nother. \nAs against the fairly minimal risks involved in\nsustaining the closely defined claim of non-representation we\nhave recognized must be weighed the very serious dangers that the\n- 18 -\n\n- 19 - No. 66\nalleged denial of counsel entails.  \"'Of all the rights that an\naccused person has, the right to be represented by counsel is by\nfar the most pervasive for it affects his ability to assert any\nother rights he may have'\" (United States v Cronic, 466 US at\n654, quoting Schaefer, Federalism and State Criminal Procedure,\n70 Harv L Rev 1, 8 [1956]).  The failure to honor this right,\nthen, cannot but be presumed to impair the reliability of the\nadversary process through which criminal justice is under our\nsystem of government dispensed.  This action properly understood,\nas it has been by distinguished members of the prosecution and\ndefense bars alike, does not threaten but endeavors to preserve\nour means of criminal adjudication from the inevitably corrosive\neffects and unjust consequences of an unfair adversary process.   \nIt is not clear that defendants actually contend that\nstated claims for the denial of assistance of counsel would be\nnon-justiciable; their appellate presentation, both written and\noral, has been principally to the effect that the claims alleged\nare exclusively predicated on deficient performance, a\ncharacterization which we have rejected.  Supposing, however, a\npersisting, relevant contention of non-justiciability, it is\nclear that it would be without merit.  This is obvious because\nthe right that plaintiffs would enforce -- that of a poor person\naccused of a crime to have counsel provided for his or her\ndefense -- is the very same right that Gideon has already\ncommanded the States to honor as a matter of fundamental\n- 19 -\n\n- 20 - No. 66\nconstitutional necessity.  There is no argument that what was\njusticiable in Gideon is now beyond the power of a court to\ndecide.  \nIt is, of course, possible that a remedy in this action\nwould necessitate the appropriation of funds and perhaps,\nparticularly in a time of scarcity, some reordering of\nlegislative priorities.  But this does not amount to an argument\nupon which a court might be relieved of its essential obligation\nto provide a remedy for violation of a fundamental constitutional\nright (see Marbury v Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 147 [1803] [\"every\nright, when withheld, must have a remedy, and every injury its\nproper redress\"]).  \nWe have consistently held that enforcement of a clear\nconstitutional or statutory mandate is the proper work of the\ncourts (see Campaign for Fiscal Equity v State of New York, 86\nNY2d 307 [1995]; Jiggets v Grinker, 75 NY2d 411 [1990]; McCain v\nKoch, 70 NY2d 109 [1987]; Klostermann v Cuomo, 61 NY2d 525\n[1984]), and it would be odd if we made an exception in the case\nof a mandate as well-established and as essential to our\ninstitutional integrity as the one requiring the State to provide\nlegal representation to indigent criminal defendants at all\ncritical stages of the proceedings against them.  \nAssuming the allegations of the complaint to be true,\nthere is considerable risk that indigent defendants are, with a\nfair degree of regularity, being denied constitutionally mandated \n- 20 -\n\n- 21 - No. 66\ncounsel in the five subject counties.  The severe imbalance in\nthe adversary process that such a state of affairs would produce\ncannot be doubted.  Nor can it be doubted that courts would in\nconsequence of such imbalance become breeding grounds for\nunreliable judgments.  Wrongful conviction, the ultimate sign of\na criminal justice system's breakdown and failure, has been\ndocumented in too many cases.  Wrongful convictions, however, are\nnot the only injustices that command our present concern.  As\nplaintiffs rightly point out, the absence of representation at\ncritical stages is capable of causing grave and irreparable\ninjury to persons who will not be convicted.  Gideon's guarantee\nto the assistance of counsel does not turn upon a defendant's\nguilt or innocence, and neither can the availability of a remedy\nfor its denial.\nAccordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should\nbe modified, without costs, by reinstating the complaint in\naccordance with this opinion, and remitting the case to that\ncourt to consider issues raised but not determined on the appeal\nto that court, and, as so modified, affirmed.\n- 21 -\n\nKimberly Hurrell-Harring v State of New York\nNo. 66 \nPIGOTT, J.(dissenting) :\nThere is no doubt that there are inadequacies in the\ndelivery of indigent legal services in this State, as pointed out \nby the New York State Commission on the Future of Indigent\nDefense Services, convened by former Chief Judge Kaye.  I\nrespectfully dissent, however, because, despite this, in my view,\nthe complaint here fails to state a claim, either under the\ntheories proffered by plaintiffs--ineffective assistance of\ncounsel and deprivation of the right to counsel at a critical\nstage (arraignment)--or under the \"constructive denial\" theory\nread into the complaint by the majority.  \nThe majority rightly rejects plaintiffs' ineffective\nassistance cause of action; such claims are limited to a case-by-\ncase analysis and cannot be redressed in a civil proceeding. \nRather than dismissing that claim, however, the majority replaces\nit with a \"constructive denial\" cause of action that, in my view,\nis nothing more than an ineffective assistance claim under\nanother name.  \nThe allegations in the complaint can be broken down\ninto two categories:  (1) the deprivation of \"meaningful and\neffective assistance of counsel,\" and (2) the deprivation of the\n- 1 -\n\n- 2 - No. 66\nright to counsel at a \"critical stage\" of the proceedings, i.e.,\nthe arraignment.  The claims under the former category are many:\nlack of a sufficient opportunity to discuss the charges with\ntheir attorney or participate in their defense; lack of\npreparation by counsel; denial of investigative services; lack of\n\"vertical representation;\"1 refusal of assigned counsel to return\nphone calls or accept collect calls; inability to leave messages\non assigned counsel's answering machine due to a full voicemail\nbox, etc. \nThe majority rejects plaintiffs' main claim that the\ncomplaint states a cause of action for ineffective assistance of\ncounsel under Strickland v Washington (466 US 668 [1984])2,\nfinding \"a measure of merit\" to defendants' arguments that such\nclaims are premised on trial counsel's constitutionally deficient\nperformance and do not form the basis for systemic relief (maj\nop, 5).  I agree, and would affirm the Appellate Division's\ndetermination in that regard, because the Strickland standard is\nlimited to whether an individual has received the effective\nassistance of counsel and cannot be used to attack alleged\n1  Presumably this refers to the fact that in some\njurisdictions, a defendant may be represented by one lawyer in\nthe local criminal court and have a different lawyer assigned in\nSuperior Court.\n2  Much of the focus of the majority is on the so-called\nStrickland standard, with respect to ineffective assistance of\ncounsel.  However, the \"meaningful representation\" standard\nobviously remains the standard to be applied in this State (see\nPeople v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137 [1981]).\n- 2 -\n\n- 3 - No. 66\nsystemic failures, and the allegations of the complaint support\nno broader reading.    \n Rather than stopping at its rejection of the\nStrickland standard with respect to these allegations, however,\nthe majority advances a third theory, and reads the complaint as\nstating a claim for \"constructive denial\" of the right to\ncounsel, i.e., that upon having counsel appointed, plaintiffs\nreceived only \"nominal\" representation, such that there is a\nquestion as to whether the counties were in compliance with the\nconstitutional mandate of Gideon (maj op, 12-13).  \nIn support of this rationale, the majority relies on\nUnited States v Cronic, which recognizes a \"narrow exception\" to\nStrickland's requirement that a defendant asserting an\nineffective assistance of counsel claim must demonstrate a\ndeficient performance and prejudice (Florida v Nixon, 543 US 175,\n190 [2004]).  In other words, Cronic, too, is an ineffective\nassistance of counsel case--decided on the same day as\nStrickland--but one that allows the courts to find a Sixth\nAmendment violation \"without inquiring into counsel's actual\nperformance or requiring the defendant to show the effect it had\non the trial, (citation omitted), when 'circumstances exist that\nare so likely to prejudice the accused that the cost of\nlitigating their effect on a particular case is unjustified'\"\n(Wright v Van Patten, 552 US 120, 124 [2008] [citations\nomitted]).\n- 3 -\n\n- 4 - No. 66\nCronic's \"narrow exception\" applies to individual cases\nwhere: (1) there has been a \"complete denial of counsel;\" i.e.,\nthe defendant is denied counsel at a critical stage of the trial;\n(2) \"counsel entirely fails to subject the prosecution's case to\nmeaningful adversarial testing;\" or (3) \"the likelihood that any\nlawyer, even a fully competent one, could provide effective\nassistance is so small that a presumption of prejudice is\nappropriate without inquiry into the actual conduct of the trial\"\n(id. at 659-660).   \nCronic's holding is instructive, if only to point out\nthat the Supreme Court was reaching the obvious conclusion that,\nin individual cases, the absence or inadequacy of counsel must\ngenerally fall within one of those three narrow exceptions.3 \nConstructive denial of counsel is a branch from the Strickland\ntree, with Cronic applying only when the appointed attorney's\nrepresentation is so egregious that it's as if defendant had no\nattorney at all.  Therefore, whether a defendant received\nineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland or is entitled\nto a presumption of prejudice under Cronic is a determination\nthat can only be made after the criminal proceeding has ended;\n3  Even the defendant in Cronic was not entitled to rely on\nany of the exceptions delineated in that opinion, notwithstanding\nthe fact that his retained counsel withdrew shortly before the\ntrial date and, just 25 days before trial, the court appointed a\nyoung lawyer with a real estate practice to represent defendant\nin a mail fraud case that had taken the Government 4 ½ years to\ninvestigate.  Supreme Court held that any errors by counsel at\ntrial were to be examined using the Strickland test.\n- 4 -\n\n- 5 - No. 66\nneither approach lends itself to a proceeding like the one at bar\nwhere plaintiffs allege prospective violations of their Sixth\nAmendment rights. \nThe majority does not explain how it can conclude, on\none hand, \"that effective assistance is a judicial construct\ndesigned to do no more than protect an individual defendant's\nright to fair adjudication\" and \"is not a concept capable of\nexpansive application to remediate systemic deficiencies\" (maj,\nop, 5 [emphasis supplied]), and on the other hand that a\n\"constructive denial\" of counsel theory could potentially apply\nto this class of individuals who, when they commenced the action,\nhad not reached a resolution of their criminal cases.  Courts\nreviewing the rare constructive denial claims have done so by\nlooking at the particular egregious behavior of the attorney in\nthe particular case after the representation has concluded (see\ne.g. Burdine v Johnson, 262 F3d 336 [5th Cir 2001] cert denied\n535 US 1120 [2002] [defense counsel slept during capital trial];\nRestrepo v Kelly, 178 F3d 634 [2d Cir 1999]; Rickman v Bell, 131\nF3d 1150 [6th Cir 1991] cert denied 523 US 1133 [1992] [defense\ncounsel acted as second prosecutor]; Tippins v Walker, 77 F3d\n682, 686 [2d Cir 1996] [counsel slept through trial]; Harding v\nDavis, 878 F2d 1341 [11th Cir 1989] [constructive denial where\ncounsel responded to defendant's displeasure of his\nrepresentation by remaining silent and inactive at trial until\nreplaced by the pro se defendant]; Jenkins v Coombe, 821 F2d 158,\n- 5 -\n\n- 6 - No. 66\n161 [2d Cir 1987] cert denied 484 US 1008 [1988] [filing cursory\nfive-page brief on appeal]).\nThat is not to say that a claim of constructive denial\ncould never apply to a class where the State effectively deprives\nindigent defendants their right to counsel, only that the various\nclaims asserted by plaintiffs here do not rise to that level. \nHere, plaintiffs' complaint raises basic ineffective assistance\nof counsel claims in the nature of Strickland4 (i.e., counsel was\nunresponsive, waived important rights, failed to appear at\nhearings, and was unprepared at court proceedings) and not the\negregious type of conduct found in Cronic.  Plaintiffs' mere\nlumping together of 20 generic ineffective assistance of counsel\nclaims into one civil pleading does not ipso facto transform it\ninto one alleging a systemic denial of the right to counsel.  \nAddressing plaintiffs' second theory--deprivation of\nthe right to counsel at the arraignment--the majority posits that\nplaintiffs have stated a cognizable claim because 10 of them were\narraigned without counsel, and eight of those remained in custody\nbecause they could not meet the bail that was set (maj op, at 8-\n9).  \nIt is undisputed that a criminal defendant \"'requires\nthe guiding hand of counsel at every step in the proceedings\n4  Nor, in my view, are such claims any different from the\ngeneric ineffective assistance of counsel claims routinely\nanalyzed by state court's under this State's \"meaningful\nrepresentation\" standard as enunciated in Baldi.\n- 6 -\n\n- 7 - No. 66\nagainst him,'\" (Gideon v Wainwright, 372 US 335, 345 [1963]\nquoting Powell v Alabama, 287 US 45, 68-69 [1932]).  But the\nmajority's bare conclusion that any arraignment conducted without\nthe presence of counsel renders the proceedings a violation of\nthe Sixth Amendment, flies in the face of reality.\nThe framework of CPL article 180.00 illustrates this\npoint.5  That provision presupposes that a criminal defendant,\nupon arraignment, may not have yet retained counsel or, due to\nindigency, requires the appointment of one.  CPL 180.10 mandates\nthat, in addition to apprising him of, and furnishing him with, a\ncopy of the charges against him (see CPL 180.10 [1]), the court\nmust also inform an unrepresented defendant that he is entitled\nto, among other things, \"an adjournment for the purpose of\nobtaining counsel\" (CPL 180.10 [3]) and the appointment of\ncounsel by the court if \"he is financially unable to obtain the\n5  CPL 180.10 addresses the procedure to be followed at a\ndefendant's arraignment on a felony complaint and the defendant's\nrights in that regard.  Other provisions of the Criminal\nProcedural Law contain similar requirements.  For instance, CPL\n210.15 addresses the scenario where a defendant is arraigned on\nan indictment; however, in the latter scenario, the court's\nduties and responsibilities to apprise a defendant of his rights\nwhen appearing without counsel are essentially the same.  CPL\n170.10 addresses arraignments relative to an information,\nsimplified information, prosecutor's information or misdemeanor\ncomplaint, and sets forth the procedures the court must follow in\napprising a defendant of his right to counsel and/or assignment\nof counsel.   \n- 7 -\n\n- 8 - No. 66\nsame\" (CPL 180.10 [3] [c]).6  The court must also give the\ndefendant the opportunity to avail himself of those rights and\n\"must itself take such affirmative action as is necessary to\neffectuate them\" (CPL 180.10 [4]).  This statute is a\nprophylactic one whose purpose is to protect a defendant's Sixth\nAmendment rights because, even in a situation where a defendant\nchooses to go forward without counsel, \"the court must permit him\nto do so if it is satisfied that he made such decision with the\nknowledge and significance thereof\" and, in a situation where it\nis not so satisfied, may decide not to proceed until defendant\nobtains or is appointed counsel (CPL 180.10 [5]).\nGiving plaintiffs the benefit of every favorable\ninference (see Leon v Martinez, 84 NY2d 83, 87-88 [1994]), the\ncomplaint nevertheless fails to state a cause of action for the\ndeprivation of the right to counsel at arraignment.  One reason\nis that there is no allegation that the failure to have counsel\nat one's first court appearance had an adverse effect on the\ncriminal proceedings.  The Second Circuit has rejected the\nassertion \"that the absence of counsel upon arraignment is an\ninflexible, per se violation of the Sixth Amendment\" (United\nStates ex rel. Caccio v Fay, 350 F2d 214, 215 [2d Cir 1965]). \n6  Indeed, the Supreme Court of the United States has\nfavorably cited to CPL 180.10 in support of its observation that\nNew York is one of the 43 States that \"take[s] the first step\ntoward appointing counsel 'before, at or just after initial\nappearance'\" (Rothgery v Gillespie County, 128 S.Ct. 2578, 2586-\n2587 n14 [2008]).  \n- 8 -\n\n- 9 - No. 66\nWhere a criminal defendant is arraigned without the presence of\ncounsel and pleads not guilty--or the court enters a not guilty\nplea on his behalf--there is no Sixth Amendment violation (see\nUnited States ex rel. Combs v Denno, 357 F2d 809, 812 [2d Cir\n1966]; United States ex rel Hussey v Fay, 220 FSupp 562 [SDNY\n1963]; see also Holland v Allard, 2005 WL 2786909 [EDNY 2005]). \nThe explanation as to why this is so is simple:\n\"Under New York law, a defendant suffers no .\n. . prejudice [by the imposition of a not\nguilty plea on arraignment without benefit of\ncounsel], for whatever counsel could have\ndone upon arraignment on defendant's behalf,\ncounsel were free to do thereafter.  There is\nnothing in New York law which in any way\nprevents counsel later taking advantage of\nevery opportunity or defense which was\noriginally available to a defendant upon his\ninitial arraignment\" (Hussey, 220 FSupp at\n563 citing People v Combs, 19 AD2d 639, 640\n[2d Dept 1963]).\nAs pleaded, none of the 10 plaintiffs arraigned without\ncounsel entered guilty pleas and, indeed, in compliance with the\nstrictures of CPL 180.10, all met with counsel shortly after the\narraignment.  Nor is there any claim that the absence of counsel\nprejudiced these plaintiffs (cf. White v Maryland, 373 US 59\n[1963] [defendant, at initial proceeding without counsel, pleaded\nguilty without the knowledge that even if that plea was vacated\nafter counsel was appointed, it was still admissible at trial,\nsuch that lack of counsel at initial proceeding required reversal\nof conviction]; Hamilton v Alabama, 368 US 52 [1961] [denial of\ncounsel at arraignment was reversible error where, under Alabama\n- 9 -\n\n- 10 - No. 66\nlaw, certain defenses had to be asserted during that proceeding\nor could have been \"irretrievably lost\"]).  \nThe majority implies that the complaint pleads a Gideon\nviolation because certain of the plaintiffs were not represented\nwhen the court arranged for the imposition of bail at the\narraignment (see CPL 170.10 [7]; 180.20 [6]; 210.15 [6]).7  Quite\noften this initial appearance inures to the benefit of defendant\nwho may be released on his own recognizance or on manageable bail\nwithin hours of arrest.  The only substantive allegations\nplaintiffs make relative to bail is that assigned counsel failed\nto advocate for lower bail at the arraignment or move for a bail\nreduction post-arraignment.  If anything, the complaint alleges a\nclaim for ineffective assistance of counsel under the federal or\nstate standard, but the majority has rejected such a claim in\nthis litigation (maj op, 5-7). \nFinally, the majority notes that plaintiffs do not seek\nrelief within the context of their own criminal cases, and\ntherefore allowing plaintiffs to proceed on their claims \"would\n[not] impede the orderly progress of [the] underlying criminal\nactions,\" asserting that even if plaintiffs' claims are found to\nbe meritorious after trial they would not be entitled to a\n7  The majority observes that a bail hearing is a critical\nstage of the criminal process (maj op, 10).  While that may be a\ncorrect statement of the law, it has little application to these\nfacts, as none of these plaintiffs asserts that they were forced\nto participate in a bail hearing without the aid of counsel.\n- 10 -\n\n- 11 - No. 66\nvacatur of their criminal convictions (maj op, 14-15; n6).  In my\nview, if plaintiffs are able to establish a violation of Gideon,\nthey should not be foreclosed from seeking a remedy; if\nplaintiffs are willing to waive any remedy to which they may be\nentitled, as they are doing here, then I see no reason why the\ncourts have any business adjudicating this matter.\nWhile the perfect system of justice is beyond human\nattainment, plaintiff's frustration with the deficiencies in the\npresent indigent defense system is understandable.  Legal\nservices for the indigent have routinely been underfunded, and\nappointed counsel are all too often overworked and confronted\nwith excessive caseloads, which affects the amount of time\ncounsel may spend with any given client.  Many, if not all, of\nplaintiffs' grievances have been acknowledged in the Kaye\nCommission Report, which is implicitly addressed--as it should\nbe--to the Legislature, the proper forum for weighing proposals\nto enhance indigent defense services in New York.  This complaint\nis, at heart, an attempt to convert what are properly policy\nquestions for the Legislature into constitutional claims for the\ncourts. \nAccordingly, I would affirm the order of the Appellate\nDivision.\n- 11 -\n\n- 12 - No. 66\n*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *\nOrder modified, without costs, by reinstating the complaint in\naccordance with the opinion herein and remitting the case to the\nAppellate Division, Third Department, for consideration of issues\nraised but not determined on the appeal to that court, and, as so\nmodified, affirmed.

On a prior\nappeal, this Court found, by a plurality, that the complaint\nalleged only nonjusticiable claims of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel and granted defendant State of New York's motion to\ndismiss (66 AD3d 84 [2009]).  The Court of Appeals subsequently\nmodified this Court's order and reinstated a portion of the\ncomplaint, concluding that plaintiffs stated a claim for both\nactual and \"constructive\" denial of the right to counsel under\nGideon v Wainwright (372 US 335 [1963]) and that such systemic\nclaims are justiciable in a collateral civil action seeking\nprospective relief (15 NY3d 8, 22-23 [2010]).\nIn the meantime, plaintiffs moved for class action\ncertification, seeking certification of a class of \n\"[a]ll indigent persons who have or will\nhave criminal felony, misdemeanor, or\nlesser charges pending against them in New\nYork state courts in Onondaga, Ontario,\nSchuyler, Suffolk and Washington counties\nwho are entitled to rely on the government\nof New York to provide them with\nmeaningful and effective defense counsel.\" \nSupreme Court denied the motion, finding that plaintiffs had\n\n-3- 509581 \nfailed to demonstrate that they would fairly and adequately\nprotect the interests of the entire class and that a class action\nwas superior to other available methods for resolving the claims. \nPlaintiffs appeal and we reverse. \nIn order to obtain class action certification, a party must\nestablish that: \n\"1. the class is so numerous that joinder\nof all members, whether otherwise required\nor permitted, is impracticable; 2. there\nare questions of law or fact common to the\nclass which predominate over any questions\naffecting only individual members; 3. the\nclaims or defenses of the representative\nparties are typical of the claims or\ndefenses of the class; 4. the\nrepresentative parties will fairly and\nadequately protect the interests of the\nclass; and 5. a class action is superior\nto other available methods for the fair\nand efficient adjudication of the\ncontroversy\" (CPLR 901 [a]). \nSignificantly, these criteria must be liberally construed and\n\"any error, if there is to be one, should be . . . in favor of\nallowing the class action\" (Pruitt v Rockefeller Ctr. Props., 167\nAD2d 14, 21 [1991] [internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted]; accord Lauer v New York Tel. Co., 231 AD2d 126, 130\n[1997]; see Liechtung v Tower Air, 269 AD2d 363, 364 [2000];\nFriar v Vanguard Holding Corp., 78 AD2d 83, 91 [1980]). \nFurthermore, while the determination as to whether a lawsuit\nqualifies as a class action rests within the sound discretion of\nthe trial court, we are vested with a corresponding power to\nsubstitute our own discretion for that of the trial court, even\nin the absence of an abuse of that discretion (see City of New\nYork v Maul, 14 NY3d 499, 509 [2010]; Small v Lorillard Tobacco\nCo., 94 NY2d 43, 52-53 [1999]).\nFollowing these principles, and guided by the Court of\nAppeals' articulation of plaintiffs' claim subsequent to Supreme\n\n-4- 509581 \nCourt's determination, we find that plaintiffs satisfied all of\nthe prerequisites to class action certification.  There can be no\nserious dispute that the proposed class, consisting of\npotentially tens of thousands of individuals, meets the\nnumerosity requirement (see CPLR 901 [a] [1]).  Furthermore,\ncommon questions of law and fact predominate over questions\naffecting only individual class members (see CPLR 901 [a] [2]). \nSignificantly, the Court of Appeals dismissed the complaint to\nthe extent that it was premised on performance based claims of\nineffective assistance of counsel, thereby obviating any need to\nconduct individualized inquiries into the performance of the\nclass members' individual attorneys.  With only the claims of\n\"outright\" and \"constructive denial\" of the right to counsel at a\ncritical stage of the criminal proceeding remaining (15 NY3d at\n22-23), the \"basic, unadorned question presented [in this action]\nis whether the State has met its obligation to provide counsel\"\n(id. at 23).  That is, the inquiry distills to whether, \"in one\nor more of the five counties at issue[,] the basic constitutional\nmandate for the provision of counsel to indigent defendants at\nall critical stages is at risk of being unmet because of systemic\nconditions\" (id. at 25).  It is this concrete legal issue, and\nthe constitutional right to counsel sought to be vindicated, that\nis common to all members of the class and transcends any\nindividual questions.  That the class members may have suffered\nthe deprivation of their constitutional right to counsel in\nvarying manners – be it through outright denial of counsel during\narraignment or a bail hearing, or nonrepresentation at a critical\nstage — does not compel a conclusion that individual issues\npredominate; \"it is 'predominance, not identity or unanimity,'\nthat is the linchpin of commonality\" (City of New York v Maul, 14\nNY3d at 514, quoting Friar v Vanguard Holding Corp., 78 AD2d at\n98; see Fleming v Barnwell Nursing Home & Health Facilities, 309\nAD2d 1132, 1133-1134 [2003]).  Likewise, \"the fact that questions\npeculiar to each individual may remain after resolution of the\ncommon questions is not fatal to the class action\" (City of New\nYork v Maul, 14 NY3d at 514 [internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted]).  Additionally, inasmuch as the named\nplaintiffs' claims derive from the same course of conduct that\ngives rise to the claims of the other class members and is based\nupon the same legal theory (see Super Glue Corp. v Avis Rent A\nCar Sys., 132 AD2d 604, 607 [1987]; Friar v Vanguard Holding\n\n-5- 509581 \nCorp., 78 AD2d at 99), the prerequisite of typicality is also\nsatisfied (see CPLR 901 [a] [3]).\nMoreover, plaintiffs have demonstrated that the\nrepresentative parties would fairly and adequately protect the\ninterests of the entire class (see CPLR 901 [a] [4]).  Plaintiffs\nsubmitted evidence that class counsel is highly experienced in\nclass action litigation and has sufficient resources available to\nadequately protect and represent the class (see City of New York\nv Maul, 59 AD3d 187, 190 [2009], affd 14 NY3d 499 [2010]; Globe\nSurgical Supply v GEICO Ins. Co., 59 AD3d 129, 144 [2008]). \nFurthermore, affidavits from the named plaintiffs established\nthat they are familiar with the litigation and understand the\nissues involved, and several of the representative plaintiffs\nalso indicated that they joined in the lawsuit not in an effort\nto alter the outcomes of their individual cases, but in order to\nimprove the indigent defense system.  The fact that the criminal\ncases of the named plaintiffs have terminated does not, in our\nview, suggest that they will not adequately pursue the action\n(cf. United States Parole Commn. v Geraghty, 445 US 388, 397-400\n[1980]).  \nNor do we perceive a potential conflict of interest between\nplaintiffs and members of the proposed class.  In finding\notherwise, Supreme Court reasoned that plaintiffs' failure to\npursue a damages claim in this action would bar class members,\nunder principles of res judicata, from subsequently bringing\nindividual legal malpractice claims against their criminal\nattorneys.  However, \"a class action judgment 'will as a rule\nbind only as to matters actually litigated and not necessarily\nthose which merely might have been'\" (Matter of Dvelis v New York\nState Dept. of Social Servs., 146 AD2d 875, 877 [1989], lv denied\n74 NY2d 608 [1989], quoting Siegel, NY Prac § 454, at 600; see\nEliasof v Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 39 AD3d 801, 803 [2007];\ncf. Murphy v Erie County, 28 NY2d 80, 85-86 [1971]).  Here,\nindividualized damage claims related to counsel's performance in\nany given criminal proceeding will not and, in light of the Court\nof Appeals' circumscription of plaintiffs' claim, cannot be\nlitigated in this action.  Accordingly, we fail to find the\nexistence of any conflict of interest and conclude that\nplaintiffs have made a sufficient showing that the representative\n\n-6- 509581 \nplaintiffs will adequately protect the interests of the class. \nFinally, unlike Supreme Court, we find that a class action\nis superior to other available methods for obtaining a fair and\nefficient adjudication of this controversy (see CPLR 901 [a]\n[5]).  Defendants urge, and Supreme Court found, that class\naction certification is unnecessary and unwarranted here in light\nof the government operations rule.  \"That rule cautions against\nclass certification where governmental operations are involved,\nsince any relief granted to the named plaintiffs would adequately\nflow to and protect others similarly situated under principles of\nstare decisis\" (New York City Coalition to End Lead Poisoning v\nGiuliani, 245 AD2d 49, 51 [1997] [citations omitted]; see Matter\nof Martin v Lavine, 39 NY2d 72, 75 [1976]; Matter of Jones v\nBerman, 37 NY2d 42, 57 [1975]; Matter of Legal Aid Socy. v New\nYork City Police Dept., 274 AD2d 207, 213 [2000], lv dismissed\nand denied 95 NY2d 956 [2000]).  While we find a measure of merit\nto the assertion that injunctive relief granted to these 20\nplaintiffs – i.e., the provision of a public defense system that\nensures that indigent criminal defendants receive their\nconstitutionally guaranteed right to counsel – would protect the\nproposed class of indigent defendants in the counties, we\nperceive other compelling concerns weighing in favor of, and thus\nmaking superior, a class action for the purpose of adjudicating\nthis dispute.\nFirst, denial of class certification gives rise to the\npossibility of multiple lawsuits involving claims duplicative of\nthose asserted in this action and inconsistent rulings by various\ncourts in this State (see New York City Coalition to End Lead\nPoisoning v Giuliani, 245 AD2d at 52; Tindell v Koch, 164 AD2d\n689, 695 [1991]).  As noted by the Court of Appeals, \"[w]hen a\nclass seeks to compel certain behavior on the part of an entity,\nwhether it be a governmental agency or a private corporation,\n. . . there is an interest in consolidating the action in a\nsingle forum in order to avoid the possibility of conflicting\njudgments from different jurisdictions which would subject the\ndefendants to varying and possibly inconsistent obligations\"\n(Matter of Colt Indus. Shareholder Litig., 77 NY2d 185, 195\n[1991]).  \n\n-7- 509581 \nWe also find that proceeding in the absence of class action\nstatus would subject the prosecution of this case to significant\ndiscovery challenges.  Plaintiffs claim that their constitutional\nright to counsel, as well as that of all other indigent criminal\ndefendants in the counties, are being systemically denied due to\ndeficiencies in the public defense system.  It follows that, in\norder to prove their claim, plaintiffs will be saddled with the\nenormous task of establishing that deprivations of counsel to\nindigent defendants are not simply isolated occurrences in the\ncase of these 20 plaintiffs, but are a common or routine\nhappenstance in the counties.  Supreme Court found that\nplaintiffs can call current indigent defendants as nonparty\nwitnesses and rely on the histories of their criminal proceedings\nin order to prove their claim, yet, without class action\ncertification, the hurdle of ascertaining the identity of those\nindigent defendants and/or accessing the histories of their\ncriminal proceedings may prove insurmountable.\nFinally, and in our view not insignificantly, our research\nhas failed to identify a single case involving claims of systemic\ndeficiencies which seek widespread, systematic reform that has\nnot been maintained as a class action (see e.g. City of New York\nv Maul, 14 NY3d 499 [2010], supra; Brad H. v City of New York,\n276 AD2d 440 [2000], affg 185 Misc 2d 420 [2000]; New York City\nCoalition to End Lead Poisoning v Giuliani, 245 AD2d 49, 51\n[1997], supra).  Mindful of the liberal construction we must give\nto CPLR article 9, and reiterating that any error should be\nresolved in favor of granting class action certification (see\nLauer v New York Tel. Co., 231 AD2d 126, 130 [1997], supra;\nPruitt v Rockefeller Ctr. Props., 167 AD2d 14, 21 [1991], supra),\nwe conclude that the unique circumstances of this case render a\nclass action superior to other methods of adjudicating this\ncontroversy.\nRose, Malone Jr. and Garry, JJ., concur.\n\n-8- 509581 \nORDERED that the order is reversed, on the facts, with\ncosts, and motion granted.\nENTER:\nRobert D.

Cuomo, Attorney General, Albany (Victor Paladino\nof counsel), for appellants.\nShulte, Roth & Zabel, L.L.P., New York City and Deborah\nBerkman, New York Civil Liberties Union Foundation, New York\nCity, for respondents.\n__________\nKavanagh, J.\nAppeals (1) from an order of the Supreme Court (Devine,\nJ.), entered August 12, 2008 in Albany County, which denied a\nmotion by defendant State of New York to dismiss the complaint,\nand (2) from an order of said court, entered August 12, 2008 in\nAlbany County, which denied said defendant's motion to declare\nthe attorney-client privilege waived as to certain of the named\nplaintiffs, among others.\n\n-2- 505670 \nPlaintiffs commenced this action against defendant State of\nNew York1 seeking a declaration that the State's public defense\nsystem is systemically deficient and presents a grave and\nunacceptable risk that indigent criminal defendants are being or\nwill be denied their constitutional right to meaningful and\neffective assistance of counsel.  Plaintiffs also sought an\ninjunction requiring defendants to provide a system that is\nconsistent with those guarantees.  Plaintiffs moved for a\npreliminary injunction and, thereafter, the State moved to\ndismiss the complaint claiming, among other things, that the\ncomplaint failed to state a cause of action.  By order to show\ncause, the State also moved for a declaration that, for the\npurposes of the instant litigation, certain plaintiffs have\nwaived their attorney-client privilege as to the matters\npresented in their respective affidavits in support of their\nmotion for a preliminary injunction.  In separate orders, Supreme\nCourt denied the motion to dismiss on the condition that\nplaintiffs file a second amended complaint adding the counties as\ndefendants and denied the State's motion to deem certain\nplaintiffs' attorney-client privileges waived.   Defendants now\nappeal from both orders. \nThe critical issue presented by this appeal is whether\nplaintiffs – more than 20 indigent persons who were or currently\nare being represented by assigned counsel in criminal actions –\nhave stated a cause of action that is justiciable.  Of course,\nwhere a motion to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a\ncause of action is made pursuant to CPLR 3211, \"the pleading is\nto be afforded a liberal construction\" (Leon v Martinez, 84 NY2d\n83, 87 [1994]), and the court must \"accept the facts as alleged\nin the complaint as true, accord plaintiffs the benefit of every\npossible inference, and determine only whether the facts as\nalleged fit within any cognizable legal theory\" (id. at 87-88;\naccord Matter of Maron v Silver, 58 AD3d 102, 109 [2008]; see\nRubinstein v Salomon, 46 AD3d 536, 538 [2007]; Matter of Niagara\nMohawk Power Corp. v State of New York, 300 AD2d 949, 952\n1  Plaintiffs subsequently served an amended complaint\nnaming defendant Governor David Paterson as an additional\ndefendant. \n\n-3- 505670 \n[2002]).  Even applying such a rigorous standard to the State's\nmotion, plaintiffs have failed to state a cause of action that is\njusticiable and, therefore, Supreme Court's order denying the\nmotion should be reversed and plaintiffs' complaint should be\ndismissed.\nWhile plaintiffs in their complaint raise the specter that\nindividual constitutional rights will be routinely violated\nunless systemic reforms are immediately implemented in the way\nlegal services are provided to indigent criminal defendants in\nthis state, they do not claim – as the dissent acknowledges –\n\"that the actual representation they received prejudiced their\ncase.\"  In fact, while this state has provided indigent legal\nservices in one form or another for more than 40 years,\nplaintiffs do not allege, nor do they identify, any relevant\nappellate history that supports their claim that indigent\ncriminal defendants have been systemically denied their\nconstitutional right to counsel by the way these services have\nbeen delivered.2  The reality is that when plaintiffs' claim is\nstripped of its constitutional veneer, it is not about indigent\ncriminal defendants being denied their constitutional right to\ncounsel but, instead, it is simply a general complaint as to the\nquality of legal services offered to indigent criminal defendants\nin this state.  Reduced to its essential terms, plaintiffs'\ncomplaint seeks to establish that \"deficiencies\" exist in the\nquality of these legal services but, at the same time, fails to\nshow how these \"deficiencies\" have resulted in a denial of a\ndefendant's right to counsel in their criminal prosecution and\n2  Indeed, a cursory search of Lexis and Westlaw reflects\nthat ineffective assistance of counsel has rarely been raised as\nan issue in the approximate 900 appeals from criminal convictions\ntaken in the five relevant counties over the past three years. \nIn approximately 140 appeals where it has been raised as an\nissue, only two convictions were reversed on that ground. \nContrary to the dissent's conclusion that these results are\nirrelevant, this appellate record – or lack thereof – clearly\npoints out a lack of support for plaintiffs' claim that indigent\ncriminal defendants in these five counties are being systemically\ndenied their Sixth Amendment rights.\n\n-4- 505670 \nhow such \"deficiencies\" had served to affect the outcome of any\nparticular case.  In fact, these \"deficiencies\" have more to do\nwith how these programs are funded and administered than how\nindividuals have been deprived of the meaningful assistance of\ncounsel in defending against criminal charges pending against\nthem.  In our view, any decisions to address those \"deficiencies\"\nshould be made by the executive and legislative branches of\ngovernment, and not by the Judiciary.\nInitially, we note that plaintiffs' claim is based on a\nfundamental misunderstanding of the constitutional dimensions of\na defendant's right to counsel in a criminal action.  The Sixth\nAmendment to the US Constitution insures, among other things,\nthat each person charged with the commission of a crime has the\nright to a speedy and public trial, an impartial jury and the\n\"Assistance of Counsel for his [or her] defence.\"  As interpreted\nunder both the US and NY Constitutions, this guarantee has been\nfound to be synonymous with the right to the effective assistance\nof counsel (see Custis v United States, 511 US 485, 507 [1994];\nStrickland v Washington, 466 US 668, 686 [1984]; Schulz v\nMarshall, 528 F Supp 2d 77, 91 [ED NY 2007]), and is violated not\nwhenever there is a flaw or \"deficiency\" in the quality of the\nlegal representation provided indigent criminal defendants, but\nwhen that representation, taken as a whole, is so inadequate as\nto \"undermine[] the proper functioning of the adversarial process\n[so] that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just\nresult\" (Strickland v Washington, 466 US at 686; see Washington v\nHofbauer, 228 F3d 689, 702 [6th Cir 2000]; accord Girts v Yanai,\n501 F3d 743, 756-757 [6th Cir 2007], cert denied ___ US ___, 129\nS Ct 92 [2008]).  While the tests employed under both federal and\nstate law to measure the effectiveness of counsel are to some\nextent different, neither recognizes the right for its own sake\nbut, rather, for the effect it has in insuring that a defendant\ncharged with a crime has been treated fairly and the criminal\naction has produced a fair result (see People v Schulz, 4 NY3d\n521, 530-531 [2005]; People v Henry, 95 NY2d 563, 566 [2000];\nPeople v Benevento, 91 NY2d 708, 711 [1998]; People v Powers, 262\nAD2d 713, 716 [1999], lv denied 93 NY2d 1005 [1999]).  It is not,\nas plaintiffs allege, a general right that can be asserted in a\ncivil action to support a claim that seeks to compel other\nbranches of government to allocate additional public resources\n\n-5- 505670 \nand intensify administrative oversight of programs that provide\nindigent criminal defendants with legal assistance in their\ncriminal prosecutions. \nHow these programs are funded and administered does not\nnecessarily implicate the constitutional right to counsel and, as\nsuch, the claims made in this action on behalf of these\nplaintiffs are not justiciable.  Justiciability involves the\nconstitutional separation of powers and determines what matters\nshould be resolved by the Judiciary, as opposed to the executive\nor legislative branches of governments (see Matter of New York\nState Inspection, Sec. & Law Enforcement Empls., Dist. Council\n82, AFSCME, AFL-CIO v Cuomo, 64 NY2d 233, 238-239 [1984]; see\nalso Jiggetts v Grinker, 75 NY2d 411, 415-416 [1990]).  With that\nprinciple in mind, it must be remembered that complex choices\nthat entail selecting among competing priorities and allocating\nfinite resources are matters best left to the sound exercise of\nthe discretion of the coordinate branches of government and are\nnot the type that the Judiciary, to be frank, is designed or well\nsuited to make (see Jiggetts v Grinker, 75 NY2d at 415-416; see\nalso Matter of New York State Inspection, Sec. & Law Enforcement\nEmpls., Dist. Council 82, AFSCME, AFL-CIO v Cuomo, 64 NY2d at\n239; Jones v Beame, 45 NY2d 402, 407 [1978]; New York Civ.\nLiberties Union v State of New York, 3 AD3d 811, 814 [2004], affd\n4 NY3d 175 [2005]).  Yet, it is precisely those types of choices\nthat plaintiffs seek to have the Judiciary render in this action. \nThe true nature of the relief plaintiffs seek is spelled\nout in their motion for a preliminary injunction.3  Specifically,\nthey asked that an order be issued that directs the State to:\n\"1. Implement standards and procedures to ensure \n    that attorneys appointed to represent indigent       \n3  While plaintiffs rely on the report of Former Chief\nJudge Kaye's Commission on the Future of Indigent Defense\nServices (hereinafter the Kaye Commission Report), they deny that\nthey are seeking in this action the implementation of the\nreport's principal recommendation that a \"statewide defender\noffice\" be created to provide indigent legal services.\n\n-6- 505670 \n    criminal defendants have sufficient\n    qualifications and training;\n 2. Establish caseload and workload limits to ensure        \n       that public defense attorneys have adequate            \n    time to devote to each client's case;\n 3. Guarantee that every eligible indigent criminal        \n    defendant is assigned a public defense attorney        \n    within 24 hours of arrest who is present at            \n    every critical proceeding and consults with each       \n    client in advance of any critical proceeding to        \n    ensure that the attorney is sufficiently               \n    prepared for any such proceeding;\n    4. Ensure that investigators and experts are               \n          available to every public defense attorney for          \n          every case in which an attorney deems that              \n          investigative or expert services would be useful        \n          to the defense; and \n    5. Establish uniform written standards and                 \n          procedures for determining eligibility for the          \n          assignment of a public defense attorney.\"\nIn effect, plaintiffs seek an order that would \"reorder\npriorities, allocate the limited resources available and in\neffect direct how\" these programs should be administered (Jones v\nBeame, 45 NY2d at 407) – all of which are actions that, if\nimplemented, would inevitably involve the Judiciary in \"'the\nmanagement and operation of public enterprises'\" (id., quoting\nMatter of Abrams v New York City Tr. Auth., 39 NY2d 990, 992\n[1976]).  While these requests are all made under the color of\nconstitutional reform, none, when viewed in the proper context,\neven attempts to address the question as to whether an\nindividual's Sixth Amendment right to counsel has been violated\nin the underlying criminal action. \nThere can be little doubt that what plaintiffs seek in this\naction – a massive overhaul of this state's public defense system\n– has obvious and ominous implications for the constitutional\n\n-7- 505670 \nprinciple of separation of powers.  Their claim, if granted,\nnecessarily involves the judicial assumption of traditional\nlegislative prerogatives.  While not unprecedented, the Judiciary\nshould only assume such powers if the facts submitted in support\nof the claim document that the need for the relief requested is\nboth manifest and emergent (see Jiggetts v Grinker, 75 NY2d at\n415; Matter of New York State Inspection, Sec. & Law Enforcement\nEmpls. Dist. Council 82, AFSCME, AFL-CIO v Cuomo, 64 NY2d at 240-\n241; compare Matter of Swinton v Safir, 93 NY2d 758, 763\n[1999]).4  Plaintiffs have simply not made such a showing in this\naction.  They ignore any relevant appellate history and base\ntheir request for this extraordinary relief entirely upon a\nprediction that if these reforms are not immediately adopted, a\nhigh risk exists that indigent criminal defendants will be\ndeprived of their constitutional right to counsel in the future. \nSuch speculation cannot be the vehicle upon which to base the\ngrant of such extraordinary relief.5\n4   While there are obvious legislative avenues that could\nhave been pursued by plaintiffs, there is no evidence in the\nrecord that plaintiffs explored these alternatives.\n5  The authority relied upon by the dissent involved claims\nthat, as pleaded, allege that the harm to be prevented either had\nalready occurred (see Klostermann v Cuomo, 61 NY2d 525, 531\n[1984]), was ongoing, or was \"inevitable\" (Matter of Swinton v\nSafir, 93 NY2d at 763).  In New York County Lawyers' Assn. v\nState of New York (294 AD2d 69 [2002]), the Court observed that\nthe \"action was commenced in response to the widely recognized\ncrisis in New York's assigned counsel system\" and relied upon a\nfactual finding contained in an investigative report to the\neffect that inadequate compensation rates had actually caused a\n\"drastic drop\" in the number of attorneys willing to represent\nindigent defendants (id. at 71).  It further observed that this\nreduction in the number of attorneys willing to participate in\nthe assigned counsel system in turn resulted in \"major\ndisruptions in the handling of criminal prosecutions and Family\nCourt cases\" (id.).\n\n-8- 505670 \nIn support of their claims, plaintiffs rely on the Kaye\nCommission Report and its conclusion that \"nothing short of\nmajor, far-reaching, reform can insure that New York meets its\nconstitutional and statutory obligations to provide quality\nrepresentation to every indigent person accused of a crime or\nother offense.\"  While factual assertions in plaintiffs'\ncomplaint must, for purposes of this motion, be accepted as true,\nand plaintiffs are entitled to the benefit of every possible\ninference that reasonably flows from such established facts,\nlegal conclusions, even those set forth in this report, are not\nafforded the same presumption (see Fernicola v New York State\nIns. Fund, 293 AD2d 844, 844 [2002]; McNeary v Niagara Mohawk\nPower Corp., 286 AD2d 522, 523-524 [2001]).  Further, it seems to\nbe somewhat ironic that plaintiffs rely so heavily on a document\nthat was obviously prepared as an impetus for legislative reform\nof New York's assigned counsel system. \nFinally, there can be no doubt that this action will, if\nallowed to continue, have an impact on related criminal actions. \nWhile plaintiffs assert that this action will not have any effect\non their criminal prosecutions, the fact is that plaintiffs, in\nboth their original and amended complaints, seek a declaration\nthat in these criminal actions their \"rights are being violated.\" \nSuch a claim, to be proven, will necessarily involve some of the\nsame issues that undoubtedly will be raised in the underlying\ncriminal actions and will inevitably result in a collateral\nreview of assigned counsels' performances in some, if not all, of\nthose actions.  In fact, plaintiffs, in support of the relief\nthey seek in this action, have submitted 23 affidavits that\ndetail the deficiencies they claim occurred in their assigned\ncounsels' performances in the underlying criminal actions.  The\ncontent of these affidavits make the very same claims that would\nbe made in a criminal action to support a claim that they have\nnot received meaningful assistance from counsel and have been\ndenied their right under the Sixth Amendment.  Among other\nthings, these affidavits claim that the indigent criminal\ndefendants had little or no meaningful contact with their\nassigned counsel, counsel performed an inadequate investigation\nand was not prepared to participate in any of the criminal\nactions, failed to make motions, did not fully explain the\nramifications of testifying, pressured defendants into entering\n\n-9- 505670 \npleas and/or waiving their rights to testify and simply performed\npoorly at trial.  Without exception, each of these claims should\nbe raised and resolved in the action where the violation of the\nconstitutional right is alleged to have occurred.\nIn that regard, sound public policy requires that severe\nrestrictions be placed upon the ability of criminal defendants to\nlitigate claims in a civil action that can be, and ought to be,\nresolved in the criminal actions (see Matter of Veloz v Rothwax,\n65 NY2d 902, 904 [1985]; Matter of Morganthau v Erlbaum, 59 NY2d\n143, 149-152 [1983], cert denied 464 US 993 [1983]).  No showing\nhas been made here that the remedies traditionally available in\ncriminal actions – applications pursuant to CPL article 440,\ndirect appeals from a conviction and writs of habeus corpus –\ncannot effectively address any claim that these plaintiffs have\nbeen denied their constitutional right to counsel in the\nunderlying criminal actions (see People v Smith, 63 NY2d 41, 69\n[1984], cert denied 469 US 1227 [1985]; People v Tippins, 173\nAD2d 512, 513-515 [1991], lv denied 78 NY2d 1015 [1991], cert\ndenied 502 US 1064 [1990]; see also Strickland v Washington, 466\nUS at 686-693).  And it is inconceivable that if plaintiffs\nprevail in this action and obtain a declaration that their\n\"rights are being violated\" by the quality of legal\nrepresentation they are receiving in their criminal prosecutions,\nthey will not use such a ruling to challenge any convictions that\nmay have been obtained.  Simply stated, it is within the context\nof the criminal action that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel\nexists and that any violation of that right will occur.  It\nnecessarily follows that it is within that action that any\nviolation of such a right ought to be established and the\nappropriate remedy needed to address that violation ought to be\npursued.\nAs a result of our decision, we need not address the issues\nraised by Supreme Court's denial of the State's motion to declare\nthe attorney-client privilege waived as to certain of the named\nplaintiffs, and the appeal therefrom is dismissed as academic.\nLahtinen and McCarthy, JJ., concur.\n\n-10- 505670 \nPeters, J.P. (dissenting).\nWe respectfully dissent.  Initially, while we agree that\nthe majority has properly articulated our standard of review on\nthis motion to dismiss (see Leon v Martinez, 84 NY2d 83, 87-88\n[1994]), we do not believe that it has applied such standard and\nexamined the instant claim in the proper light.  Our charge here\nis simply to determine whether plaintiffs would be entitled to\nrelief on any reasonable view of the facts stated (see Campaign\nfor Fiscal Equity v State of New York, 86 NY2d 307, 318 [1995];\n219 Broadway Corp. v Alexander's, Inc., 46 NY2d 506, 509 [1979]). \nFor the reasons stated below, we believe they would be.  Whether\nplaintiffs can ultimately prove their allegations and establish\ntheir case is a matter for another day.  Likewise, the majority's\nlengthy analysis of potential remedies is patently premature at\nthis juncture.\nMoreover, we strongly disagree with the majority's\nconclusion that plaintiffs' claim is based on a fundamental\nmisunderstanding of the constitutional dimensions of the right to\ncounsel in a criminal action.  In our opinion, the majority's\nview as to what is encompassed by this right may aptly be\ncharacterized as myopic.  \nIt is fundamental to our constitutional jurisprudence, at\nboth the federal and state levels, that the right to counsel\nassures to a defendant \"'the guiding hand of counsel at every\nstep in the proceedings against him.  Without it, though he be\nnot guilty, he faces the danger of conviction because he does not\nknow how to establish his innocence'\" (Gideon v Wainwright, 372\nUS 335, 345 [1963] [emphasis added], quoting Powell v State of\nAlabama, 287 US 45, 68-69 [1932]; see Coleman v State of Alabama,\n399 US 1, 7 [1970]; People v Settles, 46 NY2d 154, 160-161\n[1978]; People ex rel. Burgess v Riseley, 66 How. Pr. [NY] 67\n[1883]).  In our state, the right of a criminal defendant \"to\ninterpose an attorney between himself [or herself] and the\nsometimes awesome power of the sovereign has long been a\ncherished principle\" which dates back to our prerevolutionary\nconstitutional law, and the protections granted by our State\nConstitution have developed independently and been extended\nbeyond those afforded by the Federal Constitution (People v\n\n-11- 505670 \nSettles, 46 NY2d at 160; see People v Ramos, 99 NY2d 27, 32-33\n[2002]; People v West, 81 NY2d 370, 373 [1993]; People v\nCunningham, 49 NY2d 203, 207 [1980]; People v Hobson, 39 NY2d\n479, 483-484 [1976]).  In fact, as the right to counsel may well\nbe the most basic constitutional right of all, this state has\n\"consistently exercised the highest degree of vigilance in\nsafeguarding the right of an accused to have the assistance of an\nattorney at every stage of the legal proceedings against him [or\nher]\" (People v Cunningham, 49 NY2d at 207 [emphasis added]; see\nPeople v Ramos, 99 NY2d at 32-33; People v West, 81 NY2d at 373;\nPeople v Hodge, 53 NY2d 313, 317-318 [1981]).  Effective\nassistance is \"essential not only to insure the rights of the\nindividual defendant but for the protection and well-being of\nsociety as well\" and is \"inviolable and fundamental to our form\nof justice,\" which ideally seeks equal representation between the\nstate and a criminal defendant (People v Settles, 46 NY2d at 161;\nsee People v Hodge, 53 NY2d at 318).\nWhen determining what constitutes effective representation,\nit has been held that the \"most critical period\" of the\nproceedings against defendants may well be \"from the time of\ntheir arraignment until the beginning of their trial, when\nconsultation, thorough-going investigation and preparation [are]\nvitally important\"; indeed, defendants are as much entitled to\nthe aid of counsel during this period as they are at the trial\nitself (Powell v State of Alabama, 287 US at 57; see Michigan v\nHarvey, 494 US 344, 348 [1990]; Coleman v State of Alabama, 399\nUS at 7; Massiah v United States, 377 US 201, 205 [1964]; People\nv Tomaselli, 7 NY2d 350, 354 [1960]; People v McLaughlin, 291 NY\n480, 482-483 [1944]; People ex rel. Burgess v Riseley, 66 How.\nPr. [NY] 67 [1883]).  Toward that end, \"the right to effective\nrepresentation includes the right to assistance by an attorney\nwho has taken the time to review and prepare both the law and the\nfacts relevant to the defense\" (People v Droz, 39 NY2d 457, 462\n[1976]; see People v Cyrus, 48 AD3d 150, 154 [2007], lv denied 10\nNY3d 763 [2008]; People v Fogle, 10 AD3d 618, 619 [2004]; People\nv Bussey, 6 AD3d 621, 623 [2004], lv denied 4 NY3d 828 [2005];\nPeople v Rojas, 213 AD2d 56, 67 [1995], lv denied 87 NY2d 907\n[1995]; People ex rel. Burgess v Riseley, 66 How. Pr. [NY] 67\n[1883]).  Importantly, it is now well settled that the denial of\nthe effective assistance of counsel, whether at a preliminary\n\n-12- 505670 \nstage or at the trial itself, is of constitutional dimension (see\nPeople v Stultz, 2 NY3d 277, 282-283 [2004]; People v Wicks, 76\nNY2d 128, 132 [1990]; People v Hodge, 53 NY2d at 320; People v\nDroz, 39 NY2d at 459).  Significantly, our Court of Appeals has\nheld that the constitutional right to counsel at every stage of\nthe proceedings is so fundamental that, even when a defendant is\ncompetently represented at trial, the deprivation of\nrepresentation during preparation for trial can warrant the\nreversal of a conviction and dismissal of an indictment (see\nPeople v Hilliard, 73 NY2d 584, 586-587 [1989]).\nIn light of the foregoing, plaintiffs' allegations – which\ninclude, among others, that they were not represented at\narraignment which, in many cases, resulted in a denial of bail or\na high bail being set causing extended pretrial detention;1 that\ntheir rights to appear, and to an indictment, before a grand jury\nwere waived by counsel without consultation; that they were\ndenied the opportunity to meet and confer with counsel in any\nmeaningful way; that counsel refused to accept telephone calls\nduring the representation; that counsel failed to perform any\nindependent investigation regarding plaintiffs' cases; and that\nplaintiffs were not informed by counsel of the full consequences\nof their guilty pleas – set forth clear deficiencies that,\nwithout question, implicate plaintiffs' right to counsel under\nour Federal and State Constitutions.  \nFor example, as detailed in the complaint, plaintiff James\nAdams was arrested on July 31, 2007 and accused of stealing\nseveral sticks of deodorant from a drug store.  He was charged\nwith, among other things, robbery in the third degree and\nburglary in the third degree.  As a result, his bail was set at\n$2,500, which he could not afford.  After several adjournments\nand a court appearance at which his assigned counsel did not\nappear, Adams attempted to file his own pro se motion and even\ncontacted the District Attorney directly to proffer his defense. \nRepeated efforts by Adams and his wife to contact his attorney by\ntelephone failed – either the voice-mail box was full or requests\n1  We also note that failure to provide counsel during\narraignment violates CPL 210.15.\n\n-13- 505670 \nfor return calls were ignored.  At a court appearance in October\n2007, the court expressed concern that Adams had been overcharged\nand, after reviewing the grand jury minutes on its own\ninitiative, ordered his attorney to file a motion to dismiss the\nindictment, which apparently had not been done as of the\ncommencement of this action.  Adams lost his job as a result of\nhis incarceration, and his wife, two daughters and granddaughter\nwere evicted from their home.  Similarly, plaintiff Lane Loyzelle\nwas arrested in September 2007 and charged with petit larceny for\nallegedly stealing $20 from two acquaintances.  He was not\nrepresented at arraignment and bail was set at $2,500, which he\ncould not afford.  Loyzelle met his attorney once, for five\nminutes, before an October 2007 court appearance in a holding\narea full of other inmates.  By the time this action was\ncommenced, Loyzelle had been incarcerated for six weeks, had lost\nhis job as a result, and had not had any contact with his\nattorney for nearly a month. \nThus, in our view, it is not plaintiffs, but the majority,\nthat misunderstand the dimensions of the constitutional right to\ncounsel.  With significant deficiencies alleged by plaintiffs, a\njusticiable cause of action has clearly been stated. \nJusticiability, in a general sense, refers \"to matters resolvable\nby the judicial branch of government as opposed to the executive\nor legislative branches or their extensions\" (Jiggetts v Grinker,\n75 NY2d 411, 415 [1990]; see New York County Lawyers' Assn. v\nState of New York, 294 AD2d 69, 72 [2002]).  Indeed, as the\nmajority aptly notes, \"[t]he paramount concern is that the\n[J]udiciary not undertake tasks that the other branches are\nbetter suited to perform\" (Klostermann v Cuomo, 61 NY2d 525, 535\n[1984]; see Jones v Beame, 45 NY2d 402, 409 [1978]).  While\ncomplex choices that involve selecting among competing priorities\nand the allocation of public funds are typically best left to the\ndecision-making of the other coordinate branches of government,\n\"it is nevertheless the responsibility of the courts to\nadjudicate contentions that actions taken by the Legislature\n. . . fail to conform to the mandates of the Constitutions\"\n(Board of Educ., Levittown Union Free School Dist. v Nyquist, 57\nNY2d 27, 39 [1982], appeal dismissed 459 US 1139 [1983]; see\nCampaign for Fiscal Equity v State of New York, 86 NY2d 307, 314-\n318 [1995], supra; New York County Lawyers' Assn. v State of New\n\n-14- 505670 \nYork, 294 AD2d at 72-73; see also Duncan v State of Michigan,\n2009 Mich. App. LEXIS 1380, *4-5, 2009 WL 1640975,     [Mich Ct\nof Appeals, June 1, 2009]).  Indeed, claims of nonjusticiability\n\"are particularly unconvincing when uttered in response to a\nclaim that existing conditions violate an individual's\nconstitutional rights\" (Klostermann v Cuomo, 61 NY2d at 537; see\nNew York County Lawyers' Assn. v State of New York, 294 AD2d at\n72-73).  As articulated by the court in Duncan v State of\nMichigan (2009 Mich. App. LEXIS 1380, at *3-4), a recent decision\nconcerning the precise issues now before this Court:  \n\"We cannot accept the proposition that the\nconstitutional rights of our citizens,\neven those accused of crimes and too poor\nto afford counsel, are not deserving and\nworthy of any protection by the\n[J]udiciary in a situation where the\nexecutive and legislative branches fail to\ncomply with constitutional mandates and\nabdicate their constitutional\nresponsibilities, either intentionally or\nneglectfully.  If not the courts, then\nwhom.\"     \nThere is no dispute that both our Federal and State\nConstitutions guarantee the right to counsel to all criminal\ndefendants where loss of liberty is at stake and, where a\ndefendant is unable to retain an attorney, require that the state\nprovide counsel (see Argersinger v Hamlin, 407 US 25, 37 [1972];\nGideon v Wainwright, 372 US at 344; Matter of Smiley, 36 NY2d\n433, 437 [1975]; People v Witenski, 15 NY2d 392, 397 [1965]). \nAnd, the constitutional right to counsel is the right to the\neffective assistance of counsel (see Strickland v Washington, 466\nUS 668, 686 [1984]; People v Benevento, 91 NY2d 708, 711 [1998]). \nPlaintiffs in this action having alleged that defendant State of\nNew York has failed its duty in this regard, in that the current\nstate of the public defense system creates a severe and\nunacceptably high risk that indigent criminal defendants are\nbeing or will be deprived of their constitutional right to the\neffective assistance of counsel, the courts have the\nresponsibility to examine the allegations and adjudicate the\n\n-15- 505670 \ndispute (see Board of Educ., Levittown Union Free School Dist. v\nNyquist, 57 NY2d at 39; Campaign for Fiscal Equity v State of New\nYork, 86 NY2d at 314-318; New York County Lawyers' Assn. v State\nof New York, 294 AD2d at 72-73).  Justiciability of the instant\nclaim is even more compelling given that the constitutional right\nat issue is so interwoven with, and necessarily implicates, the\nproper functioning of the court system itself.  That is, the\nJudiciary has a heightened responsibility to act where, as here,\nthe subject of the dispute involves \"the operation and\nadministration of the courts by the courts\" (Bruno v Codd, 47\nNY2d 582, 588 [1979]; accord New York County Lawyers' Assn. v\nState of New York, 294 AD2d at 73) and implicates the ability of\n\"the court system [to] ensure that its processes do not cause\nsystemic violations of constitutional guarantees\" (New York\nCounty Lawyers' Assn. v State of New York, 294 AD2d at 73).   \nConcerns about costs, fiscal impact and the difficulty\ncourts may encounter in fashioning and then enforcing\nparticularized remedies appropriate to repair unconstitutional\naction, while not to be ignored, cannot be sufficient to require\nus to turn a blind eye to constitutional compliance, despite the\nmajority's position to the contrary (see Board of Educ.,\nLevittown Union Free School Dist. v Nyquist, 57 NY2d at 39;\nDuncan v State of Michigan, 2009 Mich. App. LEXIS 1380, at *4-5). \nTo avoid deciding the instant dispute on that basis would wholly\n\"'undermine the function of the [J]udiciary as a coequal branch\nof government'\" (Matter of Boung Jae Jang v Brown, 161 AD2d 49,\n55 [1990], quoting Matter of Anderson v Krupsak, 40 NY2d 397, 404\n[1976]).  \nNor do we believe that plaintiffs' claims are rendered\nnonjusticiable by virtue of the fact that prospective injury is\nalleged; \"proof of a likelihood of the occurrence of a threatened\ndeprivation of constitutional rights is sufficient to justify\nprospective or preventive remedies . . . without awaiting actual\ninjury\" (Matter of Swinton v Safir, 93 NY2d 758, 765-766 [1999],\nciting Luckey v Harris, 860 F2d 1012, 1017 [11th Cir 1988];\naccord New York County Lawyer's Assn. v State of New York, 294\n\n-16- 505670 \nAD2d at 74).2  Accordingly, we would find that the present\ndispute is justiciable.\nFurther, we are unpersuaded by defendants' argument and the\nmajority's position that an ultimate finding in favor of\nplaintiffs – that the systemic deficiencies in this state's\npublic defense system create a grave and unacceptably high risk\nthat indigent defendants will not receive effective assistance – \ncould successfully be used by any of the plaintiffs in a\ncollateral or appellate attack to his or her individual\nconviction.  In order to so challenge their convictions,\nplaintiffs, like any criminal defendant, would have to\ndemonstrate not only that counsels' performance was deficient,\nbut also that the actual representation they received prejudiced\ntheir cases (see Strickland v Washington, 466 US 668 [1984],\nsupra) such that they were deprived of meaningful representation\n(see People v Benevento, 91 NY2d 708 [1998], supra).  Moreover,\nwe simply cannot agree that plaintiffs have adequate remedies at\nlaw in that they may challenge the effectiveness of counsel in\nthe context of their individual criminal cases by way of a direct\nappeal, CPL article 440 motion or habeas corpus proceeding. \nCertainly, widespread and systemic instances of deficient\nperformance caused by an ill-equipped assigned counsel system\nwill not be cured through a case-by-case examination of\nindividual criminal convictions (see New York County Lawyers'\n2  We cannot agree with the majority's attempt to\ndistinguish both Swinton v Safir (93 NY2d 758 [1999], supra) and\nNew York County Lawyer's Assn. v State of New York (294 AD2d 69\n[2002], supra) on the ground that, unlike here, the harm to be\nprevented was \"ongoing or 'inevitable.'\"  In the first place, the\ncomplaint unequivocally alleges that the constitutional rights of\nindigent defendants – as illustrated by the cases of the named\nplaintiffs – have already been, or are currently being, violated. \nMoreover, taking as true the allegations in the complaint, as we\nmust, plaintiffs allege and specify gross deficiencies in this\nstate's indigent defense system that, if proven, would\ndemonstrate an imminent and inevitable risk that the\nconstitutional rights of those persons similarly situated will be\nviolated. \n\n-17- 505670 \nAssn. v State of New York, 294 AD2d at 76).  Also, such remedies\nwould obviously be unavailable to those criminal defendants,\nincluding some of the named plaintiffs in this action, who, for\nexample, did not have counsel during arraignment, bail hearings\nor other material stages of the proceedings, but who were\nultimately acquitted or whose charges were eventually dismissed.3 \n\"The right to counsel must mean more than just the right to an\noutcome\" (Duncan v State of Michigan, 2009 Mich. App. LEXIS 1380,\nat *84). \n     \nTo the extent that the majority also takes the position\nthat resolution of plaintiffs' claims would interfere with the\nconduct of plaintiffs' criminal trials, we fail to see how this\nprovides a basis to dismiss plaintiffs' claims at this juncture. \nAs Supreme Court noted, the criminal actions of approximately\nhalf of the named plaintiffs had terminated as of the date of its\nAugust 2008 order, and the likelihood that the remaining\nplaintiffs' criminal actions will remain active by the time a\ntrial is held in the instant action is extremely slim.  Moreover,\nin the unlikely event that such is the case, any delay in the\ncriminal action could be curtailed by limitations on discovery\nand the admission of trial evidence in this action.\nFinally, the majority's \"cursory search\" of appellate\nhistory pertaining to reversals on grounds of ineffective\nassistance is simply irrelevant to the issues presented here. \n3  Plaintiff Jacqueline Winbrone, for example, was arrested\nin September 2007 and charged with possession of a loaded firearm\nin the second degree after a firearm was found in the family car. \nWinbrone was the sole caretaker of her husband, who needed\ntransportation to dialysis treatment several times per week. \nAfter bail was set at $10,000, Winbrone unsuccessfully attempted\nto contact her attorney to seek a bail reduction in order to care\nfor her husband.  Days later, Winbrone's husband died and, still\nunable to contact her attorney, she was unable to attend the\nfuneral.  In early November 2007, after writing to the court and\ncontacting a prisoners' rights organization, Winbrone was\nreleased on her own recognizance.  Ultimately, the charge against\nWinbrone was dismissed. \n\n-18- 505670 \nFirst, a finding of widespread reversals on ineffective\nassistance of counsel grounds, while arguably pertinent to\nwhether plaintiffs can ultimately establish their claim, has no\nbearing on whether they have stated a cause of action for\nprospective relief based on a substantial and imminent threat of\nthe deprivation of their constitutional rights as well as those\nof persons similarly situated.  Moreover, the fundamental flaw in\nthe majority's and defendants' position is that the standards set\nforth in Strickland v Washington (466 US 668 [1984], supra) and\nPeople v Benevento (91 NY2d 708 [1998], supra) for evaluating\nwhether counsel's performance was effective under the Federal and\nState Constitutions, respectively, are simply not applicable\nhere.  To be sure, in the context of a criminal appeal or CPL\narticle 440 motion, where a criminal defendant is seeking the\ndrastic remedy of vacating his or her conviction, it is entirely\nlogical to require a showing of prejudice resulting from\ncounsel's deficient representation.  Yet, it is neither logical\nnor workable to apply these standards to a civil claim where the\nallegations concern systemic instances of constitutionally\ninadequate representation and where the remedy sought is in the\nform of prospective relief seeking to prevent future harm. \nThus, in our view, because plaintiffs have asserted\nconstitutional claims that render this matter justiciable, and\nplaintiffs need only allege facts that fit within a cognizable\nclaim at this very early stage in the proceedings, we would\naffirm Supreme Court's order denying the State's motion to\ndismiss.\nStein, J., concurs.\n\n-19- 505670 \nORDERED that the order entered August 12, 2008 that denied\ndefendant State of New York's motion to dismiss the complaint is\nreversed, on the law, without costs, motion granted and complaint\ndismissed.\nORDERED that the appeal from the order entered August 12,\n2008 that denied defendant State of New York's motion to declare\nthe attorney-client privilege waived as to certain of the named\nplaintiffs is dismissed, as academic, without costs. \nENTER:\nMichael J.

Box 2017\nGlens Falls, New York 12801\nFor Defendant Washington County\nDevine, J:\nPlaintiffs are allegedly indigent individuals who had criminal charges pending in\nOnondaga, Ontario, Schuyler, Suffolk and Washington Counties at the time this action was\ncommenced. They commenced this purported class action seeking a declaration that their\n2\n\nconstitutional rights were being violated due to systemic deficiencies in the manner of providing\na defense to indigent individuals in the five named counties and for injunctive relief requiring the\nstate to provide a system of public defense which complies with the New York and United Sates\nConstitutions, as well as state law, in such counties. However, the proposed class does not\ninclude all persons who may suffer harm and the portion of the system challenged is not\nresponsible for inflicting much of the harm. Plaintiffs have now moved for a preliminary\ninjunction requiring the State defendants to take immediate steps to:\n1. hnplement standards and procedures to ensure that attorneys appointed to\nrepresent indigent criminal defendants have sufficient qualifications and training;\n2. .Establish caseload and workload limits to ensure that public defense attorneys\nhave adequate time to devote to each client's case;\n3. Guarantee that every eligible indigent criminal defendant is assigned apublic\ndefense attorney within 24 hours of arrest who is present at every critical\nproceeding and consults with each client in advance of any critical proceeding to\nensure that the attorney is sufficiently prepared for any such proceeding;\n4. Ensure that investigators and experts are available to every public defense attorney\nfor every case in which ail attorney deems that investigative or expert services\nwould be useful to the defense; and\nEstablish uniform written standards and procedures for determining eligibility for\n5.\nthe assignment of apublic defense attorney.\nPlaintiffs also seek additional forms of relief to ensure compliance with the injunction, including\nmandatory status reports, monitoring and negotiations with respect to a compliance plan..\nItis well settled that a party seeking apreliminary injunction must demonstrate a\nlikelihood of success on the merits, the risk of irreparable injury inthe absence of an injunction\n3\n\nand abalance of equities in its favor.' Whether to issue apreliminary injunction rests in the trial\ncourt's sound discretion.' The existence of factual questions for a trial does not prevent aparty\n. .\nfrom establishing a likelihood of success on the merits; success need not be a certainty to obtain a\npreliminary injunction. 3\nhnportantly, the purpose ofthe provisional remedy of an injunction is to preserve the\nstatus quo until the underlying action can be decided and does not \"constitute an adjudication on\nthe merits.?\" Here, it does not appear that plaintiffs are seeicing the injunction to maintain the\nstatus quo, but rather are seeking amandatory injunction which would grant some, though not\nall, ofthe ultimate relief sought in the action.. Moreover, in order to obtain the ultimate relief\navailable in the underlying action by way of apreliminary injunction, extraordinary\ncircumstances must be found to'exist.5\nWith respect to plaintiffs' likelihood of success on the merits, the complaint alleges that\n. .\ndue to anumber of systemic deficiencies in the manner in which public defense services are .\nprovided to indigent persons accused of crimes, the plaintiffs, as well as all others similarly\n!see Nobu Next Door, LLC v Fine Arts Haus., mc., 4 NY3d 839, 840 [2005]; CPLR\n6301.\n2 see Schweizer v Town of Smithtown, 19AD3d 682 [2005]; Honeywell mtl. v\nFreedman & Son, 307 AD2d 518,519 [2003]).\n3 see Cooperstown CapitaL LLC v Patton, 60 AD3d 1251, 1252-1253 [3d Dept 2009];\nKarabatas v Hagopian, 39 AD3d 930, 931 [3d Dept 2007]; see also Emerald Green Property,\nOwners Assn., me. v Jada Developers, LLC, _ AD3d _, _ 2009 NY Slip Op 05046 [3d\nDept 2009]).\n4Bonded Concrete, me. v Town of Saugerties, 42 AD3d 852, 855 n 2 [3d Dept. 2007]\n[internal quotations and citations omitted].\n./\n5 see Egan v New York Care Plus ms. Co., 266 AD2d 600,601 [3d Dept. 1999].\n4\n\nsituated, are subject to a severe and unacceptably high risk of not receiving meaningful and\neffective assistance of counsel at every critical proceeding during their criminal prosecutions. It\nis alleged that in the Counties of Onondaga, Ontario, Schuyler and Washington, defendants are\nrarely represented at arraignment when critical bail determinations are made, that many of the\ncounties have incoherent or excessively restrictive eligibility standards, that there is a general\nlack of contact and communication between the accused and the attorney which is required to\nprovide meaningful representation, that there is a lack of hiring criteria, performance standards,\nsupervision and training, that there are insufficient expert and investigative services available,\n, that the attorneys are subject to excessive caseloads and workloads which prevent them from\nproviding meaningful and effective representation, that there is a lack of vertical representation\nwith the accused being represented by several different attorneys, that there is a lack ofpolitical\nand professional independence which compromises both institutional and individual providers of\npublic defense services and, finally, that there is chronic under-funding and inadequate\ncompensation which prevents the provision of meaningful and effective representation.\nThe Court observes that there are a great number of similarities between the recent cases\ninvolving school funding and the instant action. The Court of Appeals has held that the New\nYork State Constitution only requires the state to provide aminimally adequate, sound, basic\neducation.\" Similarly, the state is only required to provide aminimally adequate criminal\ndefense.\" Itneed not provide the best possible defense. Infact, what constitutes adequate and\nmeaningful representation \"cannot be fixed with yardstick precision, but varies according to the\n6 see Campaign for Fiscal Equity v State of New York, 86NY2d. 307,316-317 [1995]).\n7 see e.g. Strickland v Washington, 466 U.S. 668,687 [1984]).\n5\n\nunique circumstances of each representation.\" Moreover, it would be troubling to require the\nstate to provide ahigher quality defense than that which could be afforded by the multitude of\ncriminal defendants who are above the level of income required to obtain counsel at public\nexpense, but who can not afford the best, most experienced attorneys.\nJust as in school funding cases, plaintiffs herein must prove that the alleged deficiencies\nin the system are aproximate cause of the circumstances which give rise to a high likelihood of\nnot receiving meaningful and effective assistance of counsel at every critical proceeding during\ntheir criminal prosecutions.\" In the education cases, the state merits burden by showing that it\nprovided adequate funding to allow local school districts to offer abasic,sound education. The\nfact that students did not actually receive auseful education as aresult of other factors did not\ngive rise to aviable cause of action.'? Similar to the viable school funding cases, the instant\nclaims are not directly result oriented; that.is, plaintiffs do not seek a level of defense which\nwould obtain dismissals or acquittals in every case. Rather, they seek the equivalent of adequate\nteachers, both in number and ability, facilities and equipment. However, contrary to the\neducation cases, the state's burden is not met solely by providing adequate funding for criminal\ndefense. The state must also ensure that minimally adequate representation is actually provided,\nas by prohibiting any political orjudicial pressure or oversight which interferes with the actual .\nprovision of adequate legal representation. Notwithstanding such requirement, in the context of\nthe instant action and motion, plaintiffs must show that deficiencies attributable to the named\n8People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137, 146 [1981].\n9 see Campaign for Fiscål Equity v State of New York, 86NY2d at 318.\n10see Paynter v State of New York, 100 NY2d 434,439 [2003]).\n6\n\ndefendants have caused the failure. If, for example, the constitutional violations are attributable\nto thejudiciary, injunctive relief would be inappropriate.\nPlaintiffs rely primarily upon the Final Report to the Chief Judge of the State ofNew\nYork by the Commission on the Future of Indigent Defense Services dated June 18,2006\n(hereinafter the Kaye Commission Report) as well as affidavits from the named plaintiffs and\nother criminal defendants from the five counties. They have also submitted affidavits and\naffirmations from defense attorneys and from an expert witness who was involved in an analysis\nof criminal defense services in Washington, Schuyler and Ontario Counties. Defendants have\nobjected to the admissibility of the Kay Commission Report as hearsay. Indeed, it is clearly\nhearsay. Plaintiffs contend that it comes within the caminan law exception for public\ndocuments.\" However, such exception is limited to public documents which contain specific\nfindings of relevant fact based upon admissible evidence.\" The Kaye Commission Report is\nconclusory in nature and does not contain any specific findings of fact with respect to any of the\nfive counties. Moreover, it is based in large part upon areport prepared by aprivate research\norganization which does not appear to be subject to any of the exceptions to the hearsay rule. As\nsuch, plaintiffs have not shown that the Kaye Commission Report constitutes admissible\nevidence.\nIn addition, the Court finds that most ofthe additional affidavits from defense attorneys\n11see e.g. Martin v Ford Motor Co., 36 AD3d 867,867 [2d Dept 2007]; Kozlowski v City\nof Amsterdam, 111AD2d 476,478-479 [3d Dept 1985].\n. . .\n!2see Cramer v Kuhns, 213 AD2d 131, 135 [3d Dept 1995]; see also Brown v State of\nNew York; 45 AD3d 15,25 [3d Dept 2007]; Donovan v West Indian American Day Carnival\nAssn, Inc., 6Mise 3d 1016(A) [Sup Ct, Kings County 2005]; Bogdan v Peekskill Community\nHasp., 168 Misc 2d 856,858-.860 [Sup Ct, Westchester County 1996].\n7\n\nand the expert witness submitted by plaintiffs in support of the motion are conc1usory or not\nbased upon personal knowledge or admissible evidence in the record. Defendants have also\nsubmitted affidavits from the defense counsel for the named plaintiffs or the prosecuting\nattorneys involved in the criminal proceedings which controvert many of the allegations intended\nto illustrate the deficiencies in the provision of criminal defense services. Thus the plaintiffs'\nfactual showing of a likelihood of success on the merits is not very persuasive.\nPlaintiffs must also show that irreparable injury is likely in the absence ofthe requested\ninjunction. Itis not enough to allege that irreparable injury will occur if some injunction is not\ngranted. Rather, plaintiffs must show a direct causal connection between each of the five aspects\nof the requested injunction and a likelihood of irreparable injury. They must offer proof that each\naspect of the requested injunction is necessary to remedy a situation which is aproximate cause' .\nof a severe and unacceptably high risk of not receiving meaningful and effective assistance of\ncounsel at every critical proceeding during the plaintiffs' criminal prosecutions.\nPlaintiffs seek an injunction requiring the state defendants to implement standards and\nprocedures to ensure that attorneys appointed to represent indigent criminal defendants in the five\ncounties have sufficient qualifications and training. The complaint further alleges that there is a\nlack of hiring criteria, performance standards, supervision and training for assigned counsel.\nHowever, there are no factual allegations in evidentiary detail that any of the attorneys who\nregularly take assignments as counsel in the subject counties are incompetent or inadequately\ntrained to provide the constitutional minimum level of representation. As such there is no proof\nthat the alleged failures have proximately caused a likelihood of inadequate assistance of counsel.\nFurthermore, there are already applicable minimum standards for admission to the practice of law\n8\n\naswell as continuing legal education requirements for all lawyers and rules requiring attorneys\nonly to accept representation of clients within their abilities. Plaintiffs have not offered any proof\nwith respect to the inadequacy of the existing requirements nor have they included any of the\ngoverning bodies regulating the practice of law as defendants.\nPlaintiffs seek to establish caseload and workload limits to ensure that public defense\nattorneys have adequate time to devote to each client's case. However, plaintiffs have failedto\nsubmit any proof in evidentiary detail establishing that any attorneys, let alone a significant\nnumber of attorneys, in the five counties are actually burdened with excessive caseloads.\nAnecdotal claims that attorneys have not spent a great deal of time on routine criminal matters do\nnot constitute proofthat the attorneys do not have sufficient time to devote to their clients.\nMoreover, defendants have submitted affidavits and affirmations from defense attorneys stating\nthat they have not been assigned excessive numbers of cases, and further that they could decline\ncases if they were too busy. fuaddition, Disciplinary Rule 6-101 (22 NYCRR § 1200.30) already\nprovides that an attorney shall not handle a legal matter without adequate preparation. Plaintiffs\nhave not offered evidentiary proof of a statistically significant number of actual violations of\nsuch rule.\nPlaintiffs seek some form of guarantee that every eligible indigent criminal defendant is\nassigned apublic defense attorney within 24 hours of arrest who is present at every critical\nproceeding and consults with each client in advance of any critical proceeding to ensure that the\nattorney is sufficiently prepared for any such proceeding. The complaint alleges that criminal\ndefendants are rarely represented at arraignment, when critical bail determinations are made.\nNone of the parties have offered any proof as to whether private pay criminal defendants are\n9\n\nnormally represented at arraignment, which can occur at almost any hour of the day or night.\nMoreover, there is no proof as to whether or not a criminal defendant's rights can be protected by\nassignment of counsel within a:reasonable period of time following arraignment with an\nimmediate application by counsel for bailor dismissal ofthe charges following the arraignment.\nFurthermore, 22 NYCRR 200.26 expressly authorizes the issuance of a securing order when a\ndefendant does not have counsel present. Plaintiffs have not challenged such regulation nor have\nthey included any of the judiciary or the Chief Administrative Judge as defendants. Itis also\nunclear how the state defendants could effectuate the requested injunctive relief, since it is.the\njudiciary which actually assigns counsel and they aré not parties to this action.\nPlaintiffs also seek an injunction to ensure that investigators and experts are available to\nevery public defense attorney for every case in which an attorney deems that investigative or\nexpert services would be useful to the defense. While they have submitted anecdotal claims that\nno investigators were used in the defenses of the named plaintiffs and other witnesses, there isno\nproofthat an attorney deemed such services necessary. There is also no proof in evidentiary\ndetail indicating that the services of investigators, and experts have actually been denied in any of\nthe five counties when an attorney has deemed them useful. Defendants have submitted\naffidavits and affirmations from defense counsel alleging that they have always been able to\nreceive such services when necessary. Moreover, pursuant to County Law § 722-c, itis for the\ncourt to determine whether services of investigators and experts are necessary and to provide for\ncompensation. As noted above, the judiciary has not been made aparty hereto.\nFinally, plaintiffs seek preliminary relief to establish uniform written standards and\nprocedures for determining eligibility for the assignment of apublic defense attorney. Thé\n10\n\ncomplaint alleges that many of the counties have incoherent or excessively restrictive eligibility\nstandards for assignment of counsel atpublic expense. However, the statutory system for the\nprovision of defense services to indigent persons leaves the issue of coverage to the counties. All\nthat is required is that all persons who are actually indigent within the meaning of the\nconstitutions of the state and federal governments be provided with a defense atpublic expense.\nThere is no prohibition against a county determining to provide additional coverage to persons\nwho are near, but above, the minimum constitutional level of indigence. As such, there is no\nconstitutional requirement for uniform standards. Moreover, it appears that establishing such a\nuniform standard would be next to impossible since the level of income necessary to constitute\nindigence may vary greatly based upon the cost of living of the locale in which the defendant\nlives, the defendant's debts and reasonable expenses, as well as the seriousness o,fthe crime for\nwhich the defendant is charged. Furthermore, plaintiffs have not offered any proof in evidentiary\ndetail indicating that any significant number of actually indigent individuals have been wrongly\ndenied the services of defense counsel at public expense. Plaintiffs have therefore failed to show\nthat irreparable injury is likely in the absence of the requested injunction.\nThe Court further finds that under the circumstances of this case a showing ofirreparable s\ninjury is necessary to tip the balancing of the equities in plaintiffs' favor. Inthe absence of proof\nthat the injunction is necessary to protect the plaintiffs' constitutional rights, plaintiffs are in\neffect seeking an improvement in criminal defense services above the level mandated by the\n,\nconstitution at significant expense to defendants, both in money and legislative and\nadministrative workload. Plaintiffs have failed to meet this test, as well.\nItis therefore determined that plaintiffs have failed to show a likelihood of success on the\n11\n\n//\nmerits. Iri fact, if this Court had not felt bound by the First Department's decision in New York\nCounty Lawyers' Assn. v State of New York (294 AD2d 69 [2d Dept 2002]) when deciding\ndefendants' prior motion to dismiss, it likely would have dismissed the entire action. Moreover,\nthe Court has not found that plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury in the absence ofthe\ninjunction or that the equities weigh in their favor. Accordingly, it is\nORDERED that plaintiffs' motion for apreliminary injunction is hereby denied.\nThis memorandum constitutes both the DECISION and ORDER of the Court. This\n, ,\nOriginal DECISION/ORDER is being sent to the attorney for the State'defendants. The signing\nof this DECISION/ORDER shall not constitute entry or filing under CPLR 2220. Counsel for\nthe plaintiffs is not relived from the applicable provision of that section with respect to filing,\nentry and notice of entry.\nSO ORDERED\nENTER\n..\nDated: Albany, New York\nJuly 15, 2009\nEU~'l'''' P.

      "title": "Hurrell-Harring Settlement Implementation: 2017 Update Report",
      "text": " \nImplementing the  \nHurrell-Harring v. The State of New \nYork Settlement  \n2017 Update \nOctober 30, 2017 \nSubmitted by the New York State Office of Indigent Legal Services in accordance with  \nSection VIII of the Hurrell-Harring v. The State of New York Stipulation and Settlement.   \n\n2017 Update to the 2015 Plans to Implement the  \nCounsel at Arraignment and Quality Improvement Objectives \nof the Hurrell-Harring v. State of New York Settlement \n \nThe New York State Office of Indigent Legal Services (ILS) submits this report to update its \n2015 plan Implementing the Quality Improvement Objectives of the Hurrell-Harring v. State of \nNew York Settlement (Quality Plan) and its 2015 plan Implementing the Counsel at Arraignment \nObligations in the Hurrell-Harring v. State of New York Settlement (Counsel at Arraignment \nPlan). This report follows up on our update reports issued in November 2016 for the Quality Plan \nand the Counsel at Arraignment Plan. The 2016 update reports detailed steps the five Hurrell-\nHarring counties had taken to implement the Quality Plan and the Counsel at Arraignment Plan. \nThis report focuses more comprehensively on the progress made towards ensuring that counsel is \npresent at all arraignments and towards improving the quality of criminal defense representation.  \n \nWhere relevant, this report incorporates progress made in implementing the ILS Criteria and \nProcedures for Determining Assigned Counsel Eligibility (Eligibility Standards), which were \nissued in April 2016, and the Settlement’s caseload relief obligations, which New York State \nfunded in fiscal year 2016-2017 at a total cost of $10.4 million for the five Hurrell-Harring \ncounties (Caseload Relief I) and is funding in fiscal year 2017-2018 at a total cost of $19 million \n(Caseload Relief II). In so doing, this report acknowledges that the Settlement’s four core \nsections - counsel at arraignment, eligibility standards, quality improvement, and caseload relief \n– are inextricably interconnected. For example, in some counties the presence of counsel at \narraignment has facilitated more immediate decisions about financial eligibility for assignment \nof counsel. Similarly, Caseload Relief funding has resulted in further initiatives to improve the \nquality of representation not only by allowing attorneys to spend more time on cases, but also by \nincreasing access to non-attorney professionals and bolstering quality control infrastructures and \ntraining. If implementation is viewed only in discrete sections, it is not possible to meaningfully \ncapture the significant improvements the Hurrell-Harring counties have made over the past two \nyears.     \n \nThis report uses information gathered from a variety of sources, including the following: \nmeetings with county officials and providers; ongoing communication with the eleven Hurrell-\nHarring providers; media accounts of Settlement implementation; and data the Hurrell-Harring \nproviders have sent to ILS. This report also relies upon information gleaned from the 146 hours \nof court observations ILS staff conducted between November 2016 and August 2017 and the 29 \nstructured interviews of provider staff attorneys conducted between March and August 2017, \nboth of which are summarized below.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1 \n \n\nCourt Observations \nBetween January and August 2017, ILS staff observed a total of 62 court sessions in a \nvariety of courts, including the following: \n \nOnondaga County: County Ct; Syracuse City Ct (Traffic part, Felony part, Drug Court part, \nDV part, part 4); Clay Twn Ct; DeWitt Twn Ct, Camillus Twn Ct; Salina Twn Ct   \nOntario County: County Ct; Canandaigua City Ct; Geneva City Ct; Canandaigua Twn Ct \nSchuyler County: County Ct; Montour Falls Vlg Ct; Watkins Glen Vlg Ct \nSuffolk County: County Court; District Court (parts D-11, D-41, D-42, D-43, D-52, D-54, D-\n55, D-56, Prisoner Part, Drug Court, Mental Health Court, Felony Part); and Riverhead \nTown Ct \nWashington County: County Ct; Ft. Edward Vlg Ct; Ft. Edward Twn Ct; Kingsbury Twn Ct \n \nWe observed a total of 247 arraignments, 418 case adjournments, 109 plea proceedings, \n58 sentencing proceedings, 4 jury trials, 1 bench trial, and 1 SORA proceeding. \n \n \n \nStructured Attorney Interviews \nBetween March and August 2017, ILS staff interviewed a total of 29 provider staff \nattorneys or panel attorneys, as follows: \n \nHiscock LAS: 1 appeals attorney; 1 parole revocation attorney \nOnondaga ACP: 3 panel attorneys (one a mentee) \nOntario CD/ACP: one CD staff attorney; 2 panel attorneys \nOntario PD: 3 staff attorneys \nSchuyler ACP: 3 panel attorneys \nSchuyler PD: 1 part-time staff attorney; 1 full-time staff attorney \nSuffolk ACP: 3 panel attorneys \nSuffolk LAS: 1 East End staff attorney; 1 County Court staff attorney; 2 District Court staff \nattorneys \nWashington ACP: 3 panel attorneys \nWashington PD: 2 staff attorneys; 1 assistant supervising attorney \n \n \nFinally, this report also acknowledges a recent change in law regarding off-hour arraignments. \nOn November 28, 2016, Governor Andrew Cuomo signed into law legislation that amends the \nJudiciary Law, the Criminal Procedure Law, and the Uniform Justice Court Act to allow for New \nYork’s Chief Administrative Judge to approve the creation of centralized arraignment parts in \n2 \n \n\neach county to “facilitate the availability of public defenders or assigned counsel for defendants \nin need of legal representation” at off-hour arraignments. See Judiciary Law § 212(1). \nCentralizing arraignments in this manner is one of the recommendations in our 2015 Counsel at \nArraignment Plan. The legislation became effective on February 26, 2017. On December 19, \n2016, the Office of Court Administration (OCA) convened a meeting of stakeholders to discuss \nthis new legislation, identify potential issues, answer questions, and provide an overview of \nOCA’s plan for implementation. Since then, stakeholders in some Hurrell-Harring counties have \nbeen meeting to discuss centralized arraignment plans, and the Chief Administrative Judge has \napproved the creation of centralized arraignment parts in two Hurrell-Harring counties – \nOnondaga and Washington. This report discusses the plans for centralized arraignments in these \ntwo counties.           \n \nThis report is divided into the following sections: \n \n•  County-specific updates on implementation of the Settlement, with a focus on progress \nmade in improving quality and ensuring counsel is present at arraignment \nI.  Onondaga County \nII.  Ontario County \nIII.  Schuyler County \nIV.  Suffolk County \nV.  Washington County \n \n•  Counsel at arraignment: benefits, county initiatives, and next steps    \n \n•  Ongoing barriers to providing quality representation   \n \n•  The June 2017 ACP Summit \n \n   \n3 \n \n\nCOUNTY-SPECIFIC UPDATES \n \nI.  ONONDAGA COUNTY \nSince the 2016 update reports, both of Onondaga County’s primary providers, the Onondaga \nCounty Bar Association’s Assigned Counsel Program (ACP) and Hiscock Legal Aid Society \n(Hiscock), have experienced a change in leadership. For Hiscock, the leadership transition has \ncontinued the organization’s focus on using State funding effectively to improve quality. For the \nACP, as detailed below, the leadership change has been a critical turning point.  \n \nAs described in our 2016 update report, since the summer of 2015 ILS had been working with \nthe ACP’s then-Executive Director, Renee Captor, to implement the Settlement, but we often \nmet resistance. In June 2016, Onondaga County issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) seeking a \nvendor to provide the mandated representation services the ACP had been providing since 2004. \nThe goal was to select a vendor by August 2016 and transition to this vendor by January 2017. \nDuring this RFP process, ILS continued working with Ms. Captor, urging her to take steps to \nimplement the Settlement. To overcome the ongoing resistance, we adopted various priorities \nand strategies. For priorities, we focused on implementing the programs called for in the 2015 \nQuality and Counsel at Arraignment Plans but held off on implementing data collection and \nmaintenance requirements. We also decided to wait to develop a plan for Caseload Relief I \nfunding until the County selected a primary provider. For strategies, we involved Kathy \nDougherty from the County Attorney’s Office to press Ms. Captor into taking steps necessary to \nimplement the arraignment programs called for in the Plan. We also conducted weekly phone \nmeetings with Ms. Captor and Ms. Dougherty to ensure that the ACP was on target to meet the \nNovember 11, 2016 Settlement deadline for implementing the programs needed for full \narraignment coverage. For the Quality Plan, in consultation with Ms. Dougherty, we assumed the \nprimary role in developing and implementing the Mentor Program and training initiatives called \nfor in the 2015 Quality Plan. For example, ILS developed the protocols for the Mentor Program, \nincluding the protocol for selecting the mentors; ILS scheduled and organized the orientation \nprogram for the mentors and the joint orientation program for the mentors and mentees; and ILS, \nin consultation with the mentors, created and implemented a curriculum of Continuing Legal \nEducation (CLE) training programs for panel attorneys and then partnered with the New York \nState Defenders Association (NYSDA) and the New York State Association of Criminal Defense  \nLawyers (NYSACDL) to deliver these programs. Additionally, ILS assumed the responsibility of \nnotifying panel attorneys about these initiatives.   \n \nIn September 2016, the County announced that the ACP had been selected as the primary \nprovider of mandated public criminal defense services. We intensified our efforts to work with \nMs. Captor on Settlement implementation and, among other things, urged her to: work closely \nwith ILS to develop a plan for effectively utilizing the Caseload Relief I funding; take more \nresponsibility for the Mentor Program and training initiatives; significantly reform her protocols \nfor reviewing attorney vouchers; revamp the ACP’s expert payment policies to ensure the \navailability of non-attorney professionals; and start collecting and maintaining relevant data. We \ncontinued to meet resistance.  \n \n4 \n \n\nIn mid-November 2016, Ms. Captor announced that she was resigning as the ACP Executive \nDirector effective December 2016. The ACP Board immediately initiated a search for new ACP \nleadership, including an Executive Director, a full-time Deputy Director, and a Quality \nEnhancement Director.   \n \nBy January 2017, Kathy Dougherty had been hired as the new ACP Executive Director; she \nbegan the position on January 17, 2017. Her first task was to work with the ACP Board to recruit \nand hire Laura Fiorenza as Quality Enhancement Director and David Savlov as Deputy Director. \nMs. Fiorenza began working for the ACP on February 27, 2017, and Mr. Savlov on March 6, \n2017. Once these three individuals were on board, ILS worked with them to develop an updated \nQuality Plan that accounts for the change in ACP leadership and the money available in caseload \nrelief which allows the ACP to bolster its quality oversight infrastructure.  \n \nIt is within this context that we detail the County’s progress in implementing the Settlement. \n \nA.  Quality  \nOnondaga County was allocated $588,677 of the Settlement’s $2 million in Quality funding to \nimprove the quality of indigent criminal defense representation. The ACP received $432,934 and \nHiscock received $155,697. Additionally, the County was allocated $4.2 million in Caseload \nRelief I funding. These two sources of funding, combined with new leadership for both \nmandated providers, have resulted in Onondaga County making significant progress toward \nimproving the quality of public defense. \n  \n1.  Hiscock Legal Aid Society \n \nHiscock received $155,697 from the Settlement’s Quality funding to address its most pressing \nneed: a significant criminal appeals backlog. Because of this backlog, defendants typically wait \ntwo years, often while incarcerated, before their assigned appellate attorney can start working on \ntheir appeal. Pursuant to the 2015 Quality Plan, the $155,697 was used to hire two appellate \nattorneys to help alleviate the backlog. Hiscock advertised, interviewed, and hired two full-time \nappellate attorneys in May 2016.  \n \nWhile this has allowed Hiscock to keep pace with the current level of newly assigned appeals, it \nhas had only a minimal impact on the appeals backlog. This issue was fully illuminated in \nDecember 2016, when ILS issued its Caseload Standard Report, which identified the average \nminimum number of new assigned appeals each provider should receive each year. The \ninformation ILS has received from Hiscock suggests that, in terms of newly assigned cases, they \nare on target to meet this caseload standard. But the caseload standards do not account for case \nbacklogs, and Hiscock appeals attorneys continue to confront the dilemma of devoting sufficient \ntime to their current cases or devoting less time on each current case so they can resolve the \nbacklog.  \n       \nHiscock and ILS have worked together to address this problem, and the current plan for the new \nCaseload Relief II funding sets aside funding to implement an appellate backlog project that \nshould resolve the backlog within three years.   \n \n5 \n \n\nThe Caseload Relief I funding also allowed Hiscock to hire a third attorney for its parole \nrevocation unit. In August 2017, Hiscock hired Craig Schlanger, an experienced and reputable \ncriminal defense attorney. During our structured attorney interviews earlier this year, the parole \nrevocation attorney we interviewed identified the need for the parole unit to have a supervising \nattorney. The plan for Caseload Relief II funding provides Hiscock with the money needed for a \nsupervising attorney. Fortunately, Linda Gehron, Hiscock’s new President and Chief Executive \nOffice, has been able to re-allocate resources internally, on an interim basis, to enhance Mr. \nSchlanger’s salary so he can serve as Supervising Attorney. Ms. Gehron has reported to ILS that \nsince he has been hired, there is better quality oversight of the parole revocation unit. Mr. \nSchlanger is also regularly working with the ACP to enhance the communication between \nHiscock’s parole revocation attorneys and the assigned criminal defense attorney in those cases \nin which the parole revocation is attached to a new criminal charge. As our structured attorney \ninterviews revealed, and as Ms. Gehron has corroborated, Hiscock’s parole revocation unit still \nneeds a full-time social worker to support the attorneys, particularly where connecting clients \nwith treatment can prevent them from having their parole revoked. The current plan for Caseload \nRelief II fund provides for the hiring of a social worker.    \n \n2.  Assigned Counsel Program \n \nThe new ACP leadership has quickly undertaken initiatives and policies to transform the ACP \nand improve the quality of defense in Onondaga County. These initiatives are described below.  \n \na.  Vouchers \n \nUpon becoming Executive Director, Ms. Dougherty learned that the prior ACP Executive \nDirector had several unwritten rules or guidelines she used in reviewing vouchers, which often \nresulted in cuts to substantive attorney services. Ms. Dougherty jettisoned these unwritten rules \nso that substantive attorney services are no longer cut. Additionally, at a July 15, 2017 quarterly \nmeeting with panel attorneys, Ms. Dougherty told them that they can now bill for substantive \nservices for which they previously could not bill, such as: i) assisting their clients in completing \nthe assigned counsel application; ii) helping clients charged with Aggravated Unlicensed \nOperation of a Vehicle (AUO) resolve issues pertaining to license suspensions or revocations \nwith the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV); and iii) spending time resolving the AUO’s \nunderlying tickets. The ACP also updated the ACPeeper voucher system which blocked \nattorneys from completing their vouchers unless they explained why they had spent more than \none hour on certain substantive services. The ACP notified attorneys of this change in its August \n14, 2017 email newsletter. \n \nPanel members report that these changes are positively impacting their practices. In an August \n28, 2017 article in the Syracuse Post-Standard, attorneys reported that the ACP is more \nsupportive and that substantive services are not being cut.1 Charles Keller, a high-quality panel \nattorney, was quoted as saying: “When you know that the program supposed to be reimbursing \nyou isn’t doing it, then it’s a strong motivator not to do things you think you need to do.” He \n                                                           \n1http://www.syracuse.com/crime/index.ssf/2017/08/how_millions_in_state_money_for_poor_defendants_helped_in\n_syracuse_murder_acquit.html \n \n6 \n \n\nwent on to explain that this is no longer happening: “[Y]ou’re not getting nickled and dimed for \nanything.” The ACP is timely reimbursing for reasonable expenses the attorneys incur \nrepresenting their clients, and the voucher review has been shortened from 6-8 weeks to 1-2 \nweeks. ILS’ structured interviews of panel attorneys corroborated the change in voucher review; \nthe interviewed attorneys reported that they are seeing a dramatic difference in the voucher \nreview process and that vouchers are being processed quicker and are not being cut for \nsubstantive work.        \n \nb.  Access to Non-Attorney Professional Supports \n \nAs the Settlement recognizes, non-attorney professionals, such as experts, investigators, \ninterpreters, social workers, and mitigation specialists/sentencing advocates, are critical to \nquality representation. Data disclosed during the Hurrell-Harring litigation and information from \n2014 provided to ILS by the former ACP leadership suggest that Onondaga ACP panel attorneys \nhave traditionally used non-attorney professionals in less than 1% of cases. With Settlement \nfunding, the new ACP leadership is trying to increase the use of these non-attorney professionals \nby implementing policies requiring or urging attorneys to engage these services, including the \nfollowing:  \n \n•  Investigators are to be used in all homicide cases or when an attorney interviews a \nfact witness; \n•  A mitigation specialist should be used in any felony case where the client is eligible \nfor Youthful Offender adjudication or in Juvenile Offender cases; \n•  Interpreters must be used for non-English speaking clients; and   \n•  Attorneys are expected to contact the Regional Immigration Assistance Center \n(RIAC) for any non-citizen client. \n \nThe ACP leadership has also implemented a protocol for panel attorneys to apply directly to the \nACP to obtain these services. Under this new protocol, panel attorneys are no longer required to \napply to the court (and thus “preview” their case), but instead simply complete and email a short \napplication form to the ACP. The presumption is in favor of granting the attorney’s application \nunless the request does not make sense, is incomplete, or is unclear. In such circumstances, the \nACP will contact the panel attorney to obtain more information before approving the application. \nThe ACP will seek to process these applications as quickly as possible, with the goal of \nresponding to the request the day of receipt. The ACP has used the quarterly panel attorney \nmeetings, its weekly email newsletter, and direct communication with attorneys to inform the \npanel attorneys of the expectations regarding use of non-attorney professionals and of the new \nprotocols for engaging these services.    \n   \nThe ACP’s efforts to facilitate access to non-attorney professional supports was highlighted in \nthe August 28, 2017 Post-Standard article. On the eve of the homicide trial of his 17-year old \n7 \n \n\nclient, defense attorney Charles \nAfterward, Keller credited new leadership – and a  Keller’s expert forensic pathologist \nbecame unavailable because of a \nhuge infusion of state money – to the Assigned \nscheduling conflict. Mr. Keller \nCounsel Program for helping him provide the \nnotified the ACP leadership, and with \nstrongest defense he could on [his client’s] behalf. \ntheir assistance and their agreement to \nBefore this year, Keller said he didn’t think a new \nmake funding immediately available, \nexpert would be approved in time for trial.

The adversarial  year-old client was acquitted of \nmurder.  \njustice system only works if both sides – the \n \nprosecutors and defense lawyers – have the \nThe ACP has also addressed the issue \nresources to do their jobs, Keller said. “You can’t say \nof the hourly payment rate to ensure \nit’s an adversarial system if the New England \naccess to non-attorney professionals. \nPatriots are playing the local high school team,”  Until August 2016, non-attorney \nKeller said. “It’s not David and Goliath anymore.”  professionals were paid hourly rates \nKeller’s reaction was echoed among other defense  consistent with guidelines issued by \nthe Chief Administrator of the Courts \nlawyers who routinely take cases on behalf of people \nin 1992. Thus, for example, \nwho can’t afford their own lawyers. \ninvestigators were reimbursed at $32 \n                    -Syracuse Post-Standard, August 28, 2017    \nper hour; interpreters between $30 \nand $40 per hour. These hourly rates \nwere well below the rates these non-\nattorney professionals could make in private retained cases or other types of assigned cases (such \nas federal cases), and well below rates that other ACPs across the state pay for reimbursement. In \nJune 2016, the ACP Board raised the hourly rate for investigators to $50, and after taking over as \nACP Executive Director, Kathy Dougherty met with the two investigators used most often by \nACP attorneys and convinced them to begin taking assigned cases again. For other non-attorney \nprofessionals, the ACP does not cap the hourly rate.      \n \nThe ACP has also begun compiling lists of experts and other non-attorney professional supports \nto facilitate access to these professionals. Additionally, the ACP is developing contractual \nrelationships with reputable investigators, interpreters, social workers, and/or sentencing \nadvocates to ensure that these resources are accessible to attorneys. Having contractual \nrelationships with non-attorney professionals will significantly facilitate panel attorney access to \nthese services, thereby encouraging their use. Ms. Dougherty met with the mentors in February \n2017 to discuss non-attorney professional services and to identify some of the better respected \nprofessionals in Onondaga County. She has also obtained the approval of the ACP Board to \nsubcontract with high-quality, non-attorney professionals.  \n \nThe ACP also will incorporate into its training and CLE curriculums use of non-attorney \nprofessional services and where appropriate, invite investigators, experts, and other non-attorney \nprofessionals to participate in trainings. The training curriculum that the ACP is developing will \nemphasize the importance of using these services and identify clear steps in accessing them. The \nfoundation for this training has been set – i.e., on March 3, 2017, the ACP co-sponsored an \n8 \n \n\n“Investigating Your Case” CLE that included a presentation by Paul Chambers, the Senior \nInvestigator for the Ontario County Public Defender Office.     \n \nc.  Communication with Panel Attorneys \n \nThe ACP has taken several steps to enhance communication with its panel attorneys. Panel \nattorneys raised this issue with ILS early on, with one attorney describing communication as “a \nblack hole,” explaining that his emails and phone calls to the ACP typically went unanswered. \nThis issue was aptly illustrated during a November 18, 2016 meeting with panel attorneys which \nILS organized. In response to ILS’ suggestion that attorneys could email information to the ACP, \none attorney asked: “Does the ACP do business by e-mail? I’ve sent numerous correspondence \nby e-mail and no response. I’ve sent them to the Director, Assistant Director, and others. I \nassumed you do not do business by e-mail.”  \n \nWhen Kathy Dougherty took over as Executive Director in January 2017, she prioritized \neffective communication with panel attorneys, a priority now shared by all ACP staff members. \nStrategies for effective communication include the following: \n \n•  Regular meetings with panel attorneys: The ACP has conducted three panel-wide \nmeetings thus far: one on January 19, 2017; one on July 11, 2017; and one on \nSeptember 12, 2017. The ACP plans to continue these meetings on a quarterly basis.  \n \n•  A weekly email newsletter: In June 2017, Ms. Fiorenza began her weekly email \nnewsletter (ACP Defender) which is sent to all panel attorneys each Monday.  In ACP \nDefender, Ms. Fiorenza describes new or changing policies, provides court updates, \nnotifies panel attorneys of training opportunities, provides a schedule of upcoming \ntrials for attorneys to observe, and highlights ACP attorney successes. She also \nprovides links to legal updates and articles relevant to panel attorney work.   \n \n•  An on-line presence: While the ACP is in the process of developing a website, Ms. \nFiorenza began an ACP Facebook page on May 15, 2017.    \n \nPerhaps most importantly, Ms. Dougherty ensures that the ACP is responsive to attorney \nquestions and concerns. She has circulated to the panel a list of all staff and their emails. During \nthe September 2017 panel meeting, she introduced key ACP staff members to the panel; they \nreceived a spontaneous round of applause.    \n9 \n \n\nDuring ILS’ structured \ninterviews, attorneys  - I, for one, want to thank you and the staff for their efforts \ncommented on the \nand the vast improvements I have seen with the Program…. \naccessibility of ACP staff and \nOthers have noticed. I did an off-hour arraignment last night \ntheir sense that the ACP is \nwith Justice Pavone and he stated that there was a big \nthere to support and not \nimprovement in voucher turnaround. I let him know there \nhinder their work.  \n  has been significant progress in many other areas. \nILS has been copied in on   \nsome emails that highlight  -I personally feel the entire ACP system has done a 180. \nthis culture shift. For \nVouchers are processed quickly and we are being paid for \nexample, on June 29, 2017 \nactual work completed without fear of having vouchers \nMr. Keller sent the following \nreduced for “too much time talking to client.” [M]any \nemail to the panel: “I want to \nattorneys have expressed the sheer joy of feeling like the ACP \ncommend the new ACP \nleadership for all the hard  is here to back us up and make our jobs easier.  \nwork in changing the culture   \nat ACP.” He went on to  -Please accept my thanks for the wonderful job done by you \nexplain that he had made a \nand your staff. I completely agree, the processing of \nmistake in a voucher he \nvouchers have improved incredibly since the beginning of \nsubmitted the previous week, \nthis year. I appreciate all your efforts. \nand that he called the ACP \n \nand the mistake was \nimmediately resolved, with  -The ACP staff is just amazingly helpful… you’re all very much \n“no hassle, no threats and no  appreciated! \nfinger wagging.” Other panel                                           - Panel attorney emails to the ACP    \nattorneys have also emailed \ntheir comments about the \nACP’s transformation.  \n     \nd.  Addressing Systemic Issues \n \nThe commitment to effective communication and to addressing legitimate concerns of the panel \nattorneys has also resulted in the ACP addressing systemic barriers to quality representation that \nhad been previously ignored. Early this year, for example, panel attorneys complained about two \njail policies: first, the jail was not permitting investigators to meet confidentially with their \nincarcerated clients unless the assigned lawyer was also present; and second, attorneys were not \npermitted to bring laptops to the jail so they could review case-related videos, electronic \ndiscovery, and other case-related digital media with their clients. Ms. Dougherty met with jail \nofficials and obtained their agreement for investigators to meet confidentially with clients \nwithout the lawyer being present as long as the lawyer sends the jail verification that the \ninvestigator is engaged in the case. Jail officials also changed their policy so that ACP attorneys \nand investigators can bring laptop computers to the jail to allow clients to review case-related \ninformation. \n \n10 \n \n\nAnother systemic issue that emerged is judicial resistance to second chair assignments. As \ndiscussed below, the ACP has worked to create more second chair opportunities for panel \nattorneys. Under the previous ACP administration, any application for a second chair assignment \nwas made to the trial judge, who would decide whether to approve the application. Panel \nattorneys reported to the new ACP administration that some judges were reluctant to approve \nsecond chair applications. Ms. Dougherty and Mr. Savlov met with the individual County Court \njudges to explain the importance of the second chair program and to encourage the approval of \nsecond chair applications. However, certain County Court judges continued to deny approval of \nthe applications and made remarks to Ms. Dougherty and Mr. Savlov such as: “This is a straight-\nforward homicide; a second chair isn’t needed” and “You don’t want to spend all your money on \nthis second chair, do you?” In August 2017, the ACP announced that it was taking over the \nsecond chair application approval process. Under the new process, the lead attorney can submit a \nrequest for a second chair directly to Mr. Savlov. The lead attorney can either request to have a \nspecific panel attorney be a second chair, or can ask that the ACP select someone to be assigned. \nMr. Savlov works to match the lead attorney with the second chair, considering the needs of the \nlead attorney (i.e., research, sharing trial responsibilities) while accounting for the training \nopportunities for panel attorneys who are interested in moving to felonies, homicides, etc. Thus \nfar, this process has worked in ensuring that the ACP’s second chair program is well-utilized. \n \nThe appointment of assigned counsel for an appeal is another systemic issue the ACP leadership \nhas sought to address. In November 2016, Criminal Procedure Law (CPL) § 380.55 was enacted \nto allow trial judges, upon application of trial counsel, to appoint appellate counsel for clients \nwho are unable to afford an attorney. Previously, clients would have to wait and apply to the \nAppellate Division. The ACP notified attorneys in its weekly email newsletter that attorneys \nshould be using CPL § 380.55 to ensure that their clients have appointed appellate counsel. One \nACP attorney did so, but the trial judge denied the application in a manner suggesting that the \njudge was unwilling to ever consider appointing appellate counsel. The ACP attorney contacted \nthe ACP for assistance. Ms. Dougherty promptly met with Onondaga County Court judges to \naddress this issue. It is unclear whether it has been resolved; still, the ACP continues to urge trial \nattorneys to take advantage of the new statute. \n \nFinally, the ACP has also sought to enhance attorney-client communication by responding to \ncalls from detained ACP clients reporting that their assigned attorneys are not visiting them. The \nprevious ACP administration ignored such calls. The new ACP administration has filled this gap \nby designating Mr. Savlov as the lead for responding to calls from detained ACP clients and then \nfollowing up with the assigned attorney to ensure that he or she is notified of the client’s \ncomplaint. Mr. Savlov also guides attorneys on how to resolve these complaints. Mr. Savlov \nkeeps notes on each of the complaints by attorney name. Those notes are then incorporated into \nthe panel attorney’s “quality folder” so that the ACP has a complete picture of the panel \nattorneys when the attorneys are up for recertification.   \n \ne.  Mentor Program \n \nThe bulk of the quality money, $361,480, is earmarked for the development and implementation \nof a Mentor Program. The Mentor Program, which consists of 8 high-caliber criminal defense \nattorneys mentoring less-experienced ACP panel attorneys, has been operational since Summer \n11 \n \n\n2016. In November 2016, the Mentor Program was opened to the entire panel to allow any \nattorney who wants mentoring support to join the program. As of May 2017, the ACP has taken \nownership of the Mentoring Program, and Ms. Fiorenza is now meeting regularly with the \nmentors.  \n \nSince October 2016, the mentors have provided over 200 hours of mentoring. The mentors also \nhave been instrumental in development of the training program detailed below. Moreover, the \nmentors have been available to the new ACP administration as “sounding boards” and thought \npartners as the new leadership works to implement policies and protocols that will improve the \nquality of mandated representation in Onondaga County.   \n \nThe Quality funding provides for a part-time administrative assistant to support the Mentor \nProgram. The ACP transitioned a part-time employee to full-time status to fill this position in \nMay 2016, but she left the program on December 1, 2016. ILS administered the program until \nthe new ACP leadership was hired. Caseload Relief I funding is being used to supplement this \nQuality funding so that a full-time assistant to the Quality Enhancement Director could be hired; \nthis position was filled on June 19, 2017. \n \nILS met with the mentors on February 18, 2017 and June 2, 2017 to obtain their input on how the \nprogram is going. The mentors reported that the program continues to be functioning well, \nthough the level of mentee participation varies. Some mentors are acting more like supervisors \nfor their mentees, while others are more like consultants. The mentors report that they believe the \nMentor Program is beginning to build a culture of quality defense within Onondaga County. \n \nIn April 2017, ILS conducted a follow-up survey of the mentees to ascertain how the program is \nfunctioning and to also gain feedback about training programs. The survey was brief, asking the \nsame questions asked in the Fall 2016 survey discussed in the 2016 update report, with these \nresults:    \n \nHas the mentoring program enhanced your skills in any one of the following areas (percentages \nindicate percent of respondents who checked this skill): \nClient Communication – 37.5% \nBail – 50% \nIssue Spotting – 50% \nMotions/Pleadings – 75% \nInvestigations – 37.5% \nUse of experts, social workers, interpreters – 12.5% \nPlea Negotiations – 87.5%  \nHearings/Trials – 75%  \nSentencing (expertise and/or advocacy) – 37.5% \nCase Management – 37.5% \nOffice Management – 25% \n \nHow would you rate the quality of the advice you have received from your mentor (irrespective \nof case outcome)?   \nVery high quality – 75% \nHigh quality – 25% \n12 \n \n\n(0% of respondents checked Low quality or Very low quality) \n \nOverall, have you found the mentoring program beneficial to your practice?  \nExtremely beneficial – 100% \nSomewhat beneficial – 0% \nNot beneficial – 0% \n \nWe also asked the mentees to identify one thing that can be done to improve the Mentor \nProgram. Several mentees said that they would like to have more group events for the mentors \nand mentees to foster a culture of communication and support. Suggestions included the creation \nof a “forms” database, having a mentor work one case with the mentee from beginning to end, \nbeing able to watch the mentor in action, and having a dedicated meeting time with the mentor. \nAdditionally, we asked the mentees to provide input for additional trainings which ranged from \ntraining on legal issues to more advanced trial practice. The mentors were provided with the \nsurvey results so that they could incorporate these suggestions into their work with mentees as \nappropriate. The ACP administration also received the results, so that they could use the \nsuggestions as they develop their training curriculum.  \n \nILS interviewed a mentee as part of our structured attorney interviews. He reported that he meets \nregularly with his mentor, and this relationship has helped him “immeasurably.”  \n \nWhile it is evident that the Mentor Program has contributed to the knowledge and skills of those \nattorneys who take advantage of it, the challenge is identifying and reaching those panel \nattorneys who would benefit from the program, but do not voluntarily participate. The ACP \nintends to meet this challenge by revising its Handbook to, among other things, formalize the \nstructure of the Mentor Program and outline the circumstances in which panel attorneys will be \nrequired to participate in the program. Doing so will ensure that less experienced attorneys and \nattorneys in need of remediation have the support and quality control oversight that a mentor \nprovides.     \n \nf.  Consultation: Resource Attorneys \n \nThe 2015 Quality Plan included as part of the Mentor Program a consultation component to \nallow any attorney on the panel to access experienced attorneys – or “Resource Attorneys” – for \nbrainstorming or advice on case-related issues. As noted in our 2016 update report, the ACP had \nnot yet implemented this component of the Quality Plan. Since she has been hired as Quality \nEnhancement Director, Ms. Fiorenza has implemented this program by recruiting experienced \nattorneys, some of whom already serve as mentors, to serve as Resource Attorneys. She has \nnotified the panel of the availability of this resource in person and through the ACP’s weekly \nemail newsletter, the ACP Defender.  \n \nIn the September 18, 2017 issue of ACP Defender, Ms. Fiorenza highlighted this resource by \ndescribing how one of the panel attorneys relied on more experienced attorneys (at least one of \nwhom is a Resource Attorney), to achieve an acquittal in a City Court case:   \n \n \n \n13 \n \n\n \n \nCongratulations Ian Rennie, Not Guilty All Counts \n \nIan’s client was charged with Forcible Touching and Endangering the Welfare of a Child, and \nfound NOT Guilty on both counts. Through a lot of hard work, research and intelligent cross \nexamination Ian was able to overcome steep mountains to gain an acquittal. “It was a very \nhard earned and satisfying result as I had real doubt about the allegations from the start. I owe \ngratitude to Sue Carey, Stuart LaRose, Jeff DeRoberts and Alan Rosenthal who all provided me \nwith their own unique insights into how to handle the case and were available any time I \nneeded assistance. I question if I would have been able to achieve this result without each of \nthem,” said Rennie.  Congratulations Ian Rennie and thank you to all who offered their expertise \non this road to success. Bravo!! \n           -  September 8, 2017 ACP Defender Newsletter  \n \nNotably, this was Mr. Rennie’s first trial. The not guilty verdict saved his client from the lifetime \nof sex offender registration he would have endured had he been convicted of the misdemeanor \nsex offense. \n    \ng.  Second Chair Program \n \nThe 2015 Quality Plan also provides $37,500 in funding to expand and more fully utilize the \nACP’s Second Chair program. The Second Chair program serves dual purposes: it ensures that \ndefendants have quality representation, particularly in serious or complex cases, and it allows for \npanel attorneys to develop trial skills and experience. Though the ACP had long had a Second \nChair program, it had been under-utilized and the former ACP leadership had discouraged \nattorneys from requesting a second chair or asking to serve as a second chair to gain experience. \nIndeed, to utilize the program, attorneys had to agree not to voucher for their time as second \nchairs. Mr. Savlov is now coordinating this program and the ACP leadership is actively \nencouraging the use of second chairs by: i) implementing a protocol that makes it easy for \nattorneys to request a second chair or add themselves to a list of attorneys willing to serve as a \nsecond chair; ii) requiring that a second chair be used in certain cases, such as homicide cases or \nwhen an attorney is handling his or her first or second trial; and iii) by encouraging attorneys to \nvoucher for the time they serve as a second chair.    \n \nThe ACP leadership also promotes use of the Second Chair program in the ACP Defender \nnewsletter by celebrating successful trials and listing the primary and second chair attorneys. \nNotably, at least two of the second chair opportunities have resulted in acquittals of clients on \nhomicide charges as well as a verdict of not-guilty of the homicide charge on a third case. \n \nACP IS THE PLACE TO BE THIS SUMMER- \n \nJune 16th 2017- P v Lakeisha Brown- Acquitted of 1st and 2nd degree manslaughter \nhttp://www.syracuse.com/crime/index.ssf/2017/06/syracuse_woman_who_stabbed_\nboyfriend_to_death_during_fight_acquitted_of_crime.html  \nAttorneys Chuck Keller, Co-Counsel Stephen Heath with Inv.

Training \n \nTo enhance training opportunities, the 2015 Quality Plan allocated $10,000 to ACP’s already-\nexisting CLE program and $24,000 for intensive, hands-on trainings. As set forth in the 2016 \nupdate report, ILS had struggled to get the ACP to effectively use this money and repeatedly \nurged them to: i) develop protocols for access to scholarships and notify panel attorneys of these \nprotocols; ii) notify the panel of training opportunities; and iii) sponsor trainings specific to the \nneeds of panel attorneys. Though the ACP was recalcitrant, the mentors advocated for more \ntraining opportunities, identifying several areas of needed training. ILS partnered with the \nmentors, the New York State Defenders Association, and the New York State Association of \nCriminal Defense Lawyers to develop and implement the following CLE training programs:  \n \n•  September 10, 2016: Full day training on arraignments, accusatory instruments, and \nclient interviewing (mentee attendees only) \n \n•  November 5, 2016: Full day training on law office management, building and \nmaintaining a file, including file preparation for hearings and trials, defective accusatory \ninstruments, and motions (mentee attendees only) \n \n•  December 9, 2016: Two-hour training on the basics of sentencing and sentencing \nadvocacy (30 attendees) \n \n•  January 28, 2017:  Full day training on litigating your case (CPL § 710.30, search and \nseizure, subpoenas, suppression hearings) (40 attendees) \n \n15 \n \n\n•  February 10, 2017: Two-hour training on felony sentencing issues (Navigating New \nYork’s Sentencing Maze) (33 attendees) \n \n•  March 3, 2017: One-and-half hour training on investigations (Investigating Your Case) \n(13 attendees) \n \n•  May 19, 2017: Two-hour training on ShotSpotter – (What you need to know - New \ntechnology used by Syracuse Police Department) (27 attendees) \n \nPerhaps the most important training was the three-day Trial Training conducted April 7-9, 2017 \nat Syracuse Law School. This training emphasized key trial skills and provided participants \nmultiple opportunities to practice these skills. The training involved not only presenters and \nattorney-coaches, but also community-members who played jurors and actors who played \nwitnesses. Approximately 20 panel attorneys participated in all three days of this training. While \nthe ACP leadership was too new to participate in the planning of this CLE (which had begun in \nDecember 2016), they did participate in recruiting volunteer jurors, and they attended the \nprogram. This program was supplemented by an April 28, 2017, half-day, hands-on, skill \ndevelopment training on opening and closing statements. This training included actor coaches \nwho helped attorneys with their courtroom presence. While all the trainings above received \nexcellent feedback and evaluations from the attendees, the hands-on skills trainings in April 2017 \ndrew the most positive feedback, including the following: “Best CLE I ever had”; “Direct \nfeedback and progressive building blocks allowed me to naturally progress”; “Very helpful. I \nfeel confident now in a new style of cross-examination.” \n \n \nApril 2017 Onondaga ACP Trial Trainer – Mock Cross-Examination \n16 \n \n\n \nApril 2017 Onondaga ACP Trial Trainer – Lecture on Cross-Examinations \n \nILS has harnessed the mentors’ energy to lay the foundation for a vibrant training program for \nthe Onondaga ACP. With three core leaders in place, the ACP is well-positioned to build upon \nthis foundation. Notably, Ms. Fiorenza has already taken over the responsibility of \ncommunicating with panel attorneys about training opportunities throughout Central New York. \nAdditionally, Ms. Fiorenza, in consultation with the mentors, has developed a series of CLEs for \n2017-2018, as well as a week-long “Nuts-and-Bolts” training for new panel attorneys.   \n \ni.  ACP Office Morale \n \nPerhaps the most visible change is the boost in ACP staff morale. Through Caseload Relief I \nfunding, Ms. Dougherty increased staff salaries to reflect the work they had been doing in \naddition to their new responsibilities. The previous salaries were so low that many staff had to \nhave a second job to provide for themselves and their families. Ms. Dougherty has also \nempowered staff to use their talents and skills to flourish instead of being subjected to rigid and \nlimited roles. For example, Ms. Dougherty learned that one of her staff members has strong \ncomputer skills that were not being utilized. She learned another staff member is extremely good \nat data calculations and problem-solving through data analysis. She has given those staff \nresponsibilities that reflect their talents. Third, Ms. Dougherty has given her staff responsibility \nto communicate directly with the panel attorneys to help resolve problems. Panel attorneys know \nthat if there is an issue with eligibility, they can call or email a certain staff member. When the \ncase management system was recently unavailable due to updates, attorneys were provided the \nemails of two staff members who responded quickly (and on the weekend) to address attorney \nquestions and concerns that arose from the updates. The staff, having been empowered, are \ncomfortable responding to attorneys and providing an open and prompt line of communication. \n \n17 \n \n\nPanel attorneys have noticed this change and have sent unsolicited emails commending Ms. \nDougherty and the staff for their hard work in supporting the delivery of quality representation.  \nSome comments have been: \n \n-You guys are doing a great job at ACP FYI! \n \n-I really like this new system, dear Ishmael. Please let everyone know how their \nhard work is appreciated by one of their groupies. \n \n-I, for one want to thank you and the staff for their efforts and the vast \nimprovements I have seen with the Program. \n \n-I do feel that I need to let you know that the overwhelming majority of the panel \nattorneys appreciate the work that you and your staff are doing. \n \n-The ACP staff is just amazingly helpful \n \n-Please accept my thanks for the wonderful job done by you and your staff. \n \n          -ACP panel attorney emails \n \nILS has noticed a tangible difference in the ACP staff and office. The Hurrell-Harring team \nfrequently visits the ACP office, and the transformation in office atmosphere is apparent. Now \nupon entering the office, a staff person is there to greet visitors. Staff members are now smiling \nand engaged, actively participate in meetings, and are involved in the discussions about the work \nthey are doing. One long-time staff member told ILS that staff “used to be kept in the dark. Now \nwe understand the work that needs to be done.” It is evident to us, as it is to the panel attorneys, \nthat ACP staff members are motivated and committed to assisting attorneys in providing their \nclients high quality representation. \n \nAs stated earlier, the ACP’s ongoing challenge is continuing to train attorneys to work their cases \nmore zealously and working with attorneys who do not fully utilize the resources, training, and \nmentoring opportunities available to them. The ACP also recognizes the need to assess all panel \nattorneys to better match their experience and skills with the types of cases assigned to them. The \nACP is working to complete an updated Handbook, which will provide the foundation and \nframework for meeting these challenges.  \n   \nB.  Counsel at Arraignment \nOnondaga County has four programs to ensure that counsel is present at all arraignments, some \nof which pre-existed the Settlement through County funding, ILS funding, or a combination of \n18 \n \n\nboth, and some of which were implemented by the Settlement. These programs are discussed \nbelow. \n1.  Syracuse City Court arraignments \nPeople arrested in Syracuse are either issued an appearance ticket or detained at the local jail \nuntil the next arraignment session in Syracuse City Court, which is usually in the morning. In \n2001, the County funded defense counsel for in-custody defendants being arraigned in Syracuse \nCity Court. In 2006, using federal funding, the program was expanded to cover in-custody \narraignments that occur in the afternoon arraignment session, and in 2013, the County began \nusing ILS non-competitive grant funding to include the representation of people who are \narraigned on an appearance ticket. The County has also provided the funding needed to ensure \nthat there is an attorney present at arraignments in Syracuse City Community Court, which \nconducts arraignments one day per week. Thus, excepting the Syracuse Traffic Court part, \nHurrell-Harring Settlement funding was not needed to provide representation at City Court \narraignments. \n \nDespite the existence of the programs needed to cover Syracuse City Court arraignments, in our \n2016 update report, ILS noted that during our City Court observations, we repeatedly witnessed \ndefendants being arraigned without an arraignment attorney standing up for them. We brought \nthis issue to the attention of Ms. Captor, initially in late 2015 and then again repeatedly in 2016. \nAt the urging of the County Attorney’s Office, in late 2016, Ms. Captor finally instructed the \nCity Court arraigning attorneys to represent every person being arraigned and to record any \nmissed arraignment and the reason for the miss.  \nSince Ms. Dougherty has assumed leadership of the ACP, she has reiterated the importance of \nrepresenting every defendant being arraigned unless the defendant waives representation or has a \nretained attorney. Ms. Dougherty discovered that at least part of the problem was caused by the \ncommon practice of some arraignment attorneys leaving the arraignment session early. She has \nmade it clear to attorneys that they will not be permitted to continue staffing arraignments if they \nleave early. Additionally, in August 2017, the ACP updated its arraignment forms so that \narraigning attorneys can note any missed arraignments and the reason for the miss. On August \n26, 2017, the ACP met with the City Court arraigning attorneys to explain the updated forms and \nto disseminate written instructions for completing them. On September 5, 2017, the forms and \nwritten instructions were emailed to the entire panel. On September 12, 2017, at the quarterly \npanel meeting, the ACP reminded attorneys of the importance of using the new forms and \nrecording information about missed arraignments.   \n \nDuring our court observations of Syracuse City Court in November 2016 and August 2017, ILS \nobserved that the arraigning attorneys were representing all defendants; we did not witness any \nmissed arraignments. The ACP sent ILS data for the first quarter of 2017 (January 1, 2017 \nthrough March 31, 2017) which reveals a total of 1,924 people represented at arraignment under \nthis program. Of note, a significant majority of these - 1,461 - were in-custody arraignments. \nThis is a significant increase over the same period in 2016 during which 1,272 defendants were \nrepresented at arraignment, of which 835 were in custody.                  \n19 \n \n\nAs discussed below, the implementation of a Centralized Arraignment Program will impact the \nCity Court arraignments by adding an evening arraignment part while simultaneously expanding \nCity Court arraignments to include town and village court in-custody arraignments. Currently, it \nis hard to predict how this change will impact the number of arraignments in City Court each \nday. ILS will work with the ACP to monitor this to ensure that City Court arraignments are \nsufficiently staffed.          \n2.  Syracuse Traffic Court arraignments \nThe Settlement funds a program to staff the Syracuse Traffic Court part with an arraigning \nattorney to represent those individuals who are entitled to assigned counsel. Data the ACP sent to \nILS shows that from January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2017 this program resulted in the \narraignment representation of 593 people.    \n \nUnder the 2015 Counsel at Arraignment Plan, the arraigning attorneys are to be paid $200 per \nsession. However, when Ms. Captor started the program, she authorized payment of only $150 \nper session. The reason for this lower per session payment is unknown, and ILS was not aware of \nit until Ms. Dougherty brought it to our attention. Ms. Dougherty will increase the payment to \nthe $200 rate set forth in the plan. \n     \n3.  Town and Village Court arraignments – regular court sessions \nUntil 2013, there was no program for arraignment representation of town and village court \ndefendants. In 2013, however, Onondaga County received an ILS Counsel at First Appearance \ncompetitive grant award that funded the ACP to have attorneys present at the regular court \nsessions of the 14 largest town and village courts to represent defendants at arraignment. In \n2015, noting that there was extra funding available from this grant award, the ACP added a 15th \ncourt.   \n \nThe 2015 Counsel at Arraignment Plan extended this program to include the remaining 13 town \nand village courts. As set forth in the 2016 update report, this program started on June 1, 2016.  \nOur 2016 court observations of regular sessions of ten justice courts did not reveal any flaws in \nthese programs. Similarly, in 2017, we observed court sessions in Clay, Dewitt, Camillus, and \nSalina justice courts, and as with our 2016 court observations, we did not observe instances in \nwhich defendants were unrepresented at arraignment.      \n \nData the ACP has sent us indicates that in 15 largest courts, for the first two quarters of 2017 \n(January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2017), the program resulted in 2,036 people being represented \nby counsel at their arraignment. For the 13 smaller courts, ACP’s data reveals that from January \n1, 2017 through June 30, 2017, this program resulted in the representation of 111 people at their \narraignment.  \n      \n4.  Off-hour arraignments: the on-call program     \nAs set forth in the 2015 Counsel at Arraignment Plan, Onondaga County had no pre-existing \nprogram to cover off-hour town and village court arraignments. The 2015 Counsel at \nArraignment Plan called for and funded the creation of an on-call program to cover these \n20 \n \n\narraignments. As described in the 2016 update report, this on-call program divides the County \ninto seven regions and schedules two attorneys (a “primary” and a “back-up” attorney) per \nregion to be on-call for a full week. Each region has a “primary” and “back-up” phone, and once \ntheir on-call week is over, the attorneys must arrange a meeting with the on-call attorneys \nscheduled for the following week to hand off the phones.   \n \nIn the months following implementation of the program, ILS called participating attorneys to \nlearn how the program was going. Over the course of four months (October 2016 through \nJanuary 2017) ILS spoke to eleven different on-call attorneys. All of them stated that the \nprogram is providing a critical service. They reported that at arraignment, counsel can \neffectively: i) advocate for the defendant’s release or the possibility of release with a bail amount \nthe defendant can make; ii) ensure that defendants know their rights and that they do not \ninadvertently compromise their rights by talking about the charged offense; and iii) provide \ndefendants with the confidence that they are not alone and someone is there to advocate for \nthem. Most did not report problems with the program, though some reported that being on-call \nduring business hours posed significant challenges because it is disruptive to their practice. For \nexample, one attorney reported that both she and the back-up on-call attorney were in court the \nsame day waiting for their cases to be called when their phones rang for an arraignment. They \narranged for one to attend to the arraignment while the other covered the cases for which they \nwere in court. But the situation was not ideal.    \n \nThe ACP has reported to us that it is growing increasingly difficult to find a pool of attorneys \nwilling to be on call, and they are forced to schedule the same attorneys repeatedly. Since the \nattorneys are assigned to the cases when they conduct arraignments (an incentive for \nparticipating in the program), this creates a potential issue with attorney caseloads.    \n \nAdditionally, the on-call program is covering almost twice as many arraignments as originally \nanticipated, which means the program will significantly exceed the budget set forth in the 2015 \nCounsel at Arraignment Plan. Data the ACP sent to ILS indicates that between January 1, 2017 \nand June 30, 2017, the on-all program covered 949 arraignments. Based on this number, we \nestimate that the on-call program will cost about $190,000 more per year than budgeted. \nFortunately, as discussed next, the County is implementing a centralized arraignment program to \nreplace the on-call program. \n \n5.  Off-hour arraignments: implementation of a centralized arraignment program \nPursuant to newly-enacted Judiciary Law § 212(1)(w), the Office of Court Administration \n(OCA) has authorized Onondaga County to implement a centralized arraignment program with a \nCentralized Arraignment Part (CAP). Under this program, there are two arraignment sessions \neach day for all off-hour arraignments in the County: 1) the City Court morning arraignment \nsession; and 2) the CAP, which runs from 5:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. Both sessions run every day, \n365 days per year, and both have the jurisdiction to arraign any person arrested in the County. \nThe City Court arraignment session will conduct arraignments for those arrested and detained \nfrom 10:30 p.m. to 10:00 a.m., while the CAP will conduct arraignments for those arrested and \ndetained from 10 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. \n \n21 \n \n\nWhile ILS is concerned about any plan that relies on use of pre-arraignment detention, on \naverage this centralized arraignment program should reduce the overall amount of pre-\narraignment detention in the County because it includes people arrested in the City of Syracuse. \nCurrently, people arrested in Syracuse during the day are held overnight until the following \nmorning for arraignment in City Court, which means they can be held for up to 24 hours before \nbeing arraigned. Now people arrested in Syracuse during the day will be arraigned in the evening \nand will not be held overnight pending arraignment. Since City Court accounts for a large \nmajority of County arrests (in 2015, 6,976 of the ACP assignments were from City Court, while \n480 were from the town and village courts), there is a potential for a net decrease in pre-\narraignment detention. Moreover, the centralized arraignment plan approved by the OCA \nexplicitly disfavors pre-arraignment detention unless necessary, stating as follows: “Arraignment \nin the Centralized Arraignment Part would only be for felonies, domestic violence charges where \nan order of protection needs to be issued, or other offenses requiring an immediate arraignment \ndue to the specific nature of the offense….” This language should result in more appearance \ntickets and less pre-arraignment detention.  \n \nThe ACP worked with ILS on developing a plan to staff this centralized arraignment program.  \nUnder this plan, the ACP will staff the CAP with two attorneys who will visit the jail prior to the \narraignment session to interview detained arrestees, and then represent arrestees at their \narraignment. The ACP will also staff the CAP and the City Court morning arraignment session \nwith a program clerk. The program clerk will have a copy of the “core attorney” lists for all the \ncourts in Onondaga County, and using these lists, will assist the CAP judge in assigning counsel \nat the arraignment session. The program clerk will also assist the judge in copying documents to \nbe provided to defense counsel. To ensure that there is a program clerk available at each CAP \nsession, including weekends and holidays, the ACP anticipates recruiting a cadre of 4 to 8 people \nto be available on a rotating schedule.     \n \nFinally, the ACP will have an ACP administrative staff person, the CAP Coordinator, who will \nbe responsible for supervising the CAP program clerks (and providing back-up coverage when \nnecessary); recruiting and scheduling CAP attorneys; and handling other administrative functions \nnecessary to ensure that the CAP is staffed and running smoothly.       \n \nThe anticipated costs of ACP’s proposed CAP staffing pattern fall within the funding currently \nallocated by the State for the County’s on-call program. \n  \nAs of the writing of this report, implementation of the centralized arraignment program is \nscheduled for November 12, 2017. The ACP has already taken steps to prepare. Sovanndary Sok, \nthe ACP Arraignment Assistant, has been promoted to the positon of CAP Coordinator. Ms. Sok \nsurveyed panel attorneys and identified a pool of about 24 attorneys to staff the evening CAP \nsession on a rotational basis. The ACP has also hired 4 people to serve as part-time program \nclerks for the morning and evening arraignment sessions, and going forward will assess if \nadditional clerks are needed.  \n \nThe ACP is using the evening CAP session as an opportunity to pilot new technology to enhance \nthe collection and maintenance of data about arraignments and the conveyance of information \nfrom the arraigning attorney to the assigned attorney. The CAP arraignment attorneys will use \n22 \n \n\niPads with arraignment data collection forms that have been uploaded in PDF-fillable format.  \nThey will complete these forms at arraignment and transmit them to the ACP at the end of the \narraignment session. Notably, they will not be able to transmit the forms unless the forms are \nfully completed – i.e., information is entered in all the requisite fields. The ACP will enter the \ninformation from these forms into its case management system the following day so the assigned \nattorney can immediately access the information from these forms; the ACP will also email the \ncompleted forms to the assigned attorney. If this system works well, the ACP will consider \nreplicating it in its other arraignment programs.  \n \nOn October 11, 2017, the ACP conducted a training session with the pool of CAP evening \nsession arraignment attorneys, which ILS attended. Ms. Sok outlined the protocols for the \nprogram, including the requirement that all attorneys be trained on use of the iPads. Ms. Fiorenza \nnoted that, in terms of staffing the CAP evening session, less experienced attorneys will be \npaired with more experienced attorneys. She stressed that this new arraignment session is an \nopportunity for arraigning attorneys to advocate more zealously at arraignments in at least two \nrespects: release or low bail for defendants and moving to dismiss the accusatory instrument. Ms. \nFiorenza emphasized that the ACP would like the CAP judges to view the arraigning attorneys as \nknowledgeable and forceful advocates. Additional smaller group trainings for the CAP attorneys \nare scheduled prior to the November 12, 2017 start date.        \n \nOverall, ILS is impressed that the ACP is using the new centralized arraignment program as an \nopportunity to pilot new initiatives, including: i) more ACP control over the assignment of \ndefense counsel; ii) use of technology to enhance data collection and the handoff of information \nfrom the arraignment attorney to the assigned attorney; and iii) more zealous arraignment \nrepresentation. ILS looks forward to working with the ACP to monitor and help support the \nsuccess of Onondaga County’s centralized arraignment program.                        \n   \n23 \n \n\nII. ONTARIO COUNTY \nWell before Hurrell-Harring v. The State of New York was settled, Ontario County took \nsignificant steps to improve the quality of representation for people charged with a crime who \ncannot afford a lawyer. In 2007, when the lawsuit was filed, Ontario County’s only provider of \nmandated representation was an Assigned Counsel Program (ACP) that lacked the resources and \ninfrastructure for panel attorney support and quality oversight. In 2010, however, Ontario County \ncreated a Public Defender Office staffed with trained attorneys, eventually selecting Leanne \nLapp, an experienced and highly qualified criminal defense attorney, as the Public Defender. In \n2013, Ontario County created a Conflict Defender Office to be run by a Conflict Defender who \nwould also administer the ACP. In July 2014, the county selected Andrea Schoeneman, another \nexperienced and highly qualified attorney, as the Conflict Defender and ACP Administrator. The \nCounty’s goal was to ensure that these institutional providers headed by experienced attorneys \nwould provide the infrastructure, training, and support needed for quality representation.  \n \nIt is no surprise then, that in 2014, the Hurrell-Harring plaintiffs reached an individual \nsettlement with Ontario County. Still, though the County made significant progress in improving \nthe quality of representation even prior to 2014, there were gaps. The County’s well-intentioned \nfocus on the Public Defender Office, for example, meant that the Conflict Defender Office and \nthe ACP were not getting the attention and resources they needed. And, as with all providers \nacross New York, caseloads continued to be such that attorneys struggled to devote the time \nneeded for quality representation for all their clients. The County, however, has effectively used \nthe Settlement’s funding to start the process of addressing these gaps.             \n \nA.  Quality  \n \nOntario County was allocated $146,123 of the Settlement’s $2 million in Quality funding to \nimprove the quality of public criminal defense representation. In meeting with ILS to develop a \nplan to spend this money, it was evident that most of the funding should be targeted to the \nConflict Defender Office and the ACP, with some funding going to the Public Defender Office \nfor much-needed administrative support. Thus, it was agreed that the Public Defender Office \nwould receive $35,000, and the Conflict Defender Office and ACP would receive $111,123.  \n \n1.  Ontario County Public Defender Office \n \nThe Public Defender Office received $35,000 to fund a part-time legal support staff person to \nhelp alleviate the administrative burden placed on Ms. Lapp, and her First Assistant, Catherine \nWalsh, so that both could devote more time to supervision. In May 2016, Ms. Lapp used this \nfunding to elevate a current employee, Leah Morrow, to paralegal status. Ms. Lapp reports that \nMs. Morrow’s support continues to be instrumental in relieving some of her administrative \nburden and the burden of other support staff. Specifically, Ms. Morrow continues to assist with \neligibility intakes, thus enabling the receptionists at the front desk to assist walk-in clients and \nrespond to phone calls; she also handles eligibility interviews at the jail. Ms. Morrow also \ninterviews jailed clients to obtain needed information when attorneys are in court. She continues \nto undertake appellate responsibilities by drafting Notices of Appeal and Applications to Proceed \nas a Poor Person. More recently, Ms. Morrow has been trained in the NYSDA Veterans Defense \nProgram, and has taken on the role of “veterans’ liaison” for the Public Defender Office. In that \n24 \n \n\nrole, she completes a thorough intake of the Office’s veteran clients, requests records, \ncoordinates with the NYSDA Veterans Defense Program, and works with the County’s Veterans \nTreatment Court. Ms. Morrow’s work on this project has been an asset for Ms. Lapp and all the \nOffice’s staff attorneys.  \n \nTo address the issue of caseloads and to comply with ILS’ caseload standards, the County \ndecided to slightly shift the responsibilities of its providers. The Public Defender Office will no \nlonger be the primary provider for parole revocation cases, but will accept these assignments \nonly when a parole revocation is attached to an arrest for a new offense. Otherwise, the Conflict \nDefender Office and the Assigned Counsel Program will handle parole revocation cases. In \naddition, Ms. Lapp will monitor the office’s caseloads, and if caseloads become too high, she \nwill refrain from accepting new case assignments until the Office’s caseload stabilizes, with \nthese assignments going to the Conflict Defender or ACP.   \n \nCaseload funding has also been used to bolster the Public Defender Office’s administrative \nsupport infrastructure, and the Public Defender Office has received funding to hire an Office \nSpecialist. As of the writing of this report, Ms. Lapp has interviewed several candidates and \nidentified some qualified applicants, though she has not yet extended an offer. She anticipates \nfilling this position in November 2017.         \n \n2.  Ontario County Conflict Defender and Assigned Counsel Program \n \nMs. Schoeneman began the work of improving the quality of representation and “raising the bar” \nfor panel attorney performance in 2015 when she completed a draft Assigned Counsel Plan and \nHandbook. She worked with the Ontario County Bar Association, which approved and adopted \nthe Plan and Handbook on January 29, 2016. Together, the Plan and Handbook provide a \nframework for quality representation and set forth expectations for panel attorneys.     \n \nThe $111,123 in Quality funding has allowed Ms. Schoeneman to take additional steps to \nimprove quality. The funding is targeted as follows: $30,000 to contract with an experienced \nattorney to be a mentor to the ACP panel attorneys; $40,000 for investigators and experts; \n$31,123 for social worker/sentencing advocacy services; and $10,000 for a pilot post-conviction \nproject. \n  \na.  Mentor Attorney: \n \nAs reported in the 2016 update report, the ACP identified Robert Zimmerman to fill the role of \nmentor for the panel. Since October 28, 2016, Mr. Zimmerman and Ms. Schoeneman have been \nholding monthly meetings with the panel attorneys to brainstorm cases, discuss new initiatives in \nthe County, and review recent trials. For example, in March 2017, an ACP attorney received an \nacquittal in a trial on the charge of Rape in the Second Degree. This trial involved not only a \nsecond chair attorney but extensive investigation. At the following monthly meeting, the panel \nattorneys discussed the case and learned about the strategies the attorneys and investigator used \nto secure the acquittal. At another meeting, Ms. Schoeneman invited Jeffrey S. Rougeux, the \nDirector of Ontario County Probation, to discuss a new County initiative intended to reduce \nincarceration rates at the local jail. Under this initiative, judges have the option of sentencing a \n25 \n \n\nperson to a “weekend of treatment” instead of jail. The treatment is provided by Finger Lakes \nAddictions Counseling and Referral Agency, and runs from 8:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Saturday and \nSunday.2 During the meeting, Mr. Rougeux provided attorneys with documents describing the \nprogram and how to make referrals.  \n \nMr. Zimmerman has also conducted court observations during trials of some ACP panel \nattorneys. He has identified trial skills as a need for training; the plan for Caseload Relief II \nfunding allocates money for these trainings.  \n \nOur structured attorney interviews revealed that the ACP panel attorneys value the monthly \nmeetings and view Mr. Zimmerman as a resource. Despite this positive feedback, however, the \nACP panel attorneys are not using Mr. Zimmerman as much as they could. ILS and Ms. \nSchoeneman are working to address this issue. Ms. Schoeneman has decided to implement a \npolicy that, absent a conflict, in all felony cases that will likely result in a trial, the panel attorney \nmust consult with Mr. Zimmerman. Moreover, Ms. Schoeneman is considering engaging a \nsecond mentor who is more skilled at “pushing in” and encouraging panel attorneys to use the \nresource. \n \nb.  $40,000 for investigators and experts: \n  \nInvestigative services have been well utilized by the panel. As reported in the 2016 update \nreport, the ACP attorneys can now access investigators and experts directly through the ACP \nprogram without having to “preview” their case by applying to the court. Ms. Schoeneman \ndeveloped a protocol that requires panel attorneys to use an investigator for all A, B, and C level \nfelonies. For D and E level felonies, attorneys must indicate specific reasons if they believe an \ninvestigator is not necessary in a case. This money can also be used by the Conflict Defender \nOffice. The structured interviews revealed that attorneys welcome the new procedure. Now, the \nattorneys need only draft an email to Ms. Schoeneman with the request for service and relevant \ncase information.  All the attorneys reported that Ms. Schoeneman is responsive and gets back to \nthem quickly. The success of having a protocol that facilitates use of investigators is reflected in \nthe amount spent on investigators in 2015, prior to Settlement implementation, versus the \namounts spent in 2016 and 2017. In 2015, the Conflict Defender and ACP spent only $5,983 for \ninvestigators. In 2016, the Conflict Defender and ACP spent $19,931.25 on investigators, more \nthan a three-fold increase. Through August 2017, they have already spent $10,770 on \ninvestigations and historically they receive a high influx of invoices toward the end of the year.3 \nThus, Ms. Schoeneman believes they are on track to exceed their spending for 2016.   \n  \nc.  $30,000 for social work and sentencing advocacy services  \n \nMs. Schoeneman recruited a licensed, clinical social worker, Kimberly Goulding, to conduct \nsentencing advocacy for the panel attorneys. Ms. Goulding is a local resource with extensive \n                                                           \n2 A link to a news article describing this program is here: http://www.mpnnow.com/news/20170326/ontario-county-\ntries-treatment-instead-of-incarceration.  \n \n3 This is because, for accounting reasons, the County requires panel attorneys to submit vouchers for all outstanding \ncosts, even in cases that are not yet resolved. \n26 \n \n\nexperience in mitigation work. Unfortunately, due to the County’s contract requirements, Ms. \nSchoeneman has not been able to contract with Ms. Goulding to facilitate attorney access to her \nservices. In lieu of a contract, Ms. Schoeneman is encouraging attorneys to use Ms. Goulding’s \nservices by asking that the court assign her as an expert. Ms. Schoeneman is concerned that Ms. \nGoulding will not have enough time to handle all the potential cases in Ontario County, and she \ncontinues to search for other possible sentencing advocates. She has reached out to the Center for \nCommunity Alternatives (CCA), a non-profit organization in Syracuse, New York, to provide \nthese services. CCA currently is unable to take new case assignments because of a transition in \nstaff. Ms. Schoeneman hopes that CCA will be sufficiently staffed and able to take new cases in \nearly 2018.       \n \nd.  $10,000 post-conviction pilot project \n \nFor this post-conviction pilot project, it was decided that attorneys can use the available funding \nto research and investigate potential post-conviction claims, and where appropriate, file a motion \nwith the sentencing court to be assigned to represent defendants in a post-conviction matter \npursuant to Criminal Procedure Law § 440.10 or § 440.20. There are currently two cases pending \nthat will use these funds. \n \ne.  Additional updates  \n \nThe Conflict Defender Office, through ILS’ non-competitive distribution funding, hired an \nexperienced criminal defense attorney, Carrie Bleakley, as First Assistant Conflict Defender in \nAugust 2016. As set forth above, to ensure that the Public Defender Office can comply with ILS’ \ncaseload standards, the Conflict Defender Office is now the primary provider for most parole \nrevocation cases and therefore, needed to hire an additional attorney through Caseload Relief I \nfunding. In October 2017, Ms. Schoeneman hired Benjamin Gilmour to fill this role. The \nCaseload Relief I funding also allowed the Conflict Defender Office to hire a second \nadministrative assistant, who began work in September 2017. The administrative assistant will \nenable the office to increase its data collection ability as well as provide additional support to the \nattorneys and to Ms. Schoeneman.   \n \nCombined, the Settlement’s Quality and Caseload Relief funding have allowed the County to \nsubstantially bolster and improve the infrastructure of the Conflict Defender Office and the ACP. \nWith this stronger infrastructure, Ms. Schoeneman anticipates that she will have more time to \nspend on supervision and quality oversight of the ACP panel attorneys.  \n \nB.  Counsel at Arraignment  \n \nTo its credit, prior to the Settlement, Ontario County had already implemented programs for \nrepresentation of defendants at their first court appearance. By late 2015, the Ontario County \nPublic Defender Office was already covering arraignments that occur during regularly scheduled \nDA court sessions4 and all off-hour arraignments that occur prior to 10:00 p.m. The latter \nrequires the Public Defender Office to maintain three on-call programs: i) a rotation for off-hour \njustice court arraignments that occur during regular business hours (8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.); ii) a \n                                                           \n4 These are court sessions at which attorneys from the District Attorney’s Office regularly appear.  \n27 \n \n\nrotation for off-hour justice court arraignments that occur in the evenings (5:00 p.m. to 10:00 \np.m.); and iii) a rotation for off-hour arraignments that occur on the weekends and holidays (8:30 \na.m. to 10:00 p.m.).  These on-call rotations are staffed by all the Public Defender Office’s \nattorneys.5 \n \nFor overnight arraignments, the County had a centralized arraignment program that was started \nin 2012. People arrested after 10:00 p.m. are either issued an appearance ticket or detained until \nthe next morning to be arraigned with defense counsel present in either Canandaigua City Court \nor Geneva City Court.   \n \n1.  The Settlement’s Counsel at Arraignment Programs  \n \nAt the time of the 2015 Counsel at Arraignment Plan, the Public Defender Office had twelve \nstaff attorneys, including the Public Defender, Leanne Lapp. Ms. Lapp questioned the \nsustainability of the on-call programs and was concerned that her attorneys would experience \n“burn-out” from sacrificing their evenings and holidays in addition to performing their regular \nduties.  \n \nGiven the above, the 2015 Counsel at Arraignment Plan identified the following two potential \ngaps in arraignment coverage: \n \ni)  Weekend and overnight arraignment coverage \n \nIn 2015 when the Counsel at Arraignment Plan was developed, there was a concern that two \njustice courts were not regularly participating in the centralized arraignment program, and that it \ntherefore was necessary to create an on-call overnight arraignment program to be staffed by \nprivate attorneys. The 2015 Plan also called for the creation of a private attorney weekend on-\ncall program to replace the Public Defender Office’s program, and thus reduce attorney burn out. \nHowever, as set forth in the 2016 update report, an assessment of missed arraignment data over a \nlonger period revealed no discernible pattern to missed arraignments and no reason to believe \nthat some courts were not participating in the centralized overnight arraignment program. \nAdditionally, the Public Defender Office was not able to recruit a pool of private attorneys \nwilling to participate in an overnight or weekend on-call program. Fortunately, as discussed \nbelow, the hiring of two additional staff attorneys has significantly diminished the burden of the \nPublic Defender Office’s on-call programs.      \n        \nii)  Non-DA court sessions \n \nThe Public Defender’s Office did not have the staff to regularly cover arraignments in these \ncourt sessions, and thus coverage was sporadic. The 2015 Counsel at Arraignment Plan provided \nfunding so that the Public Defender’s Office could hire two additional attorneys to create the \ncapacity for covering arraignments at these non-DA court sessions, at a total cost of $210,000 \nper year. The first attorney was hired and began working in March 2016. Because of the \nCounty’s budget approval process, Ms. Lapp was unable to hire the second attorney until \n                                                           \n5 Ms. Schoeneman assists one night a month in staffing the on-call program, scheduling either a Conflict Defender \nOffice staff attorney or an ACP panel attorney.   \n28 \n \n\nFebruary 2017. Having these two attorneys has allowed the Public Defender Office to staff all \ncourt sessions, including non-DA court sessions.  These attorneys have also rotated into the \nPublic Defender Office’s on-call programs, significantly reducing the stress and potential for \nattorney burn-out.  \n \n2.  Assessment of Ontario’s Counsel at Arraignment Programs \n \nData the Ontario County Public Defender Office provided reveals that between November 1, \n2016 and June 30, 2017, the Office’s counsel at arraignment program covered approximately \n1,899 arraignments.6 ILS’ 2016 and 2017 observations of city and justice court sessions have not \nrevealed any issues with Ontario County’s arraignment program, and though we observed \nmultiple court sessions in 2016 (described in the 2016 update report) and again in 2017 \n(described above), we did not observe any missed arraignments.  \n \nOf course, our court observations are not comprehensive, and for that reason, the Public \nDefender Office has worked to develop and implement protocols for tracking missed \narraignments. These protocols include reviewing the county jail’s intake logs each morning, \nhaving attorneys track any arraignments of which they are notified and unable to make, and \nincluding on the application for assignment of counsel a question about representation at \narraignment. According to the missed arraignment data the Public Defender Office sent ILS, \nbetween October 1, 2016 and June 30, 2017, the Public Defender Office missed a total of 17 \narraignments. Only three of these missed arraignments were during the overnight hours, further \nreinforcing the conclusion in the 2016 update report that an overnight on-call program is not \nnecessary. Five were the result of lack of notification to the Public Defender Office or a judge \nrefusing to wait for the Public Defender Office attorney to arrive for the arraignment. Three were \nappearance ticket arraignments during non-DA court sessions, all of which occurred in late 2016 \nor early 2017; it is anticipated that now that the Public Defender Office is sufficiently staffed to \ncover non-DA court sessions these missed arraignments will be even less frequent. The reasons \nfor the remaining six missed arraignments ranged from conflict to attorney error.        \n \nIn the 2016 update report, ILS noted that the $97,000 made available in Settlement funding for \nthe overnight and weekend private attorney on-call program is not being spent. We suggested \nthat the money might be re-allocated for: 1) the creation of an administrative assistant position in \nthe Public Defender’s Office; and 2) any excess mileage costs associated with the Public \nDefender Office’s arraignment programs. Regarding the first, this position will be funded by the \nSettlement’s Caseload Relief funding. As for the second, ILS will work with the County to \nensure that, if need be, any excess mileage costs are paid through the Settlement’s Counsel at \nArraignment funding.       \n \nOf note, Leanne Lapp has told us that a County committee was created to discuss creating a \nformal centralized arraignment program pursuant to newly-enacted Judiciary Law § 212(1)(w). \nThe committee has drafted a plan to create morning and evening centralized arraignment parts \nfor off-hour, in-custody arraignments. Though the status of this proposed plan is unclear, Ms. \n                                                           \n6 This likely under-represents the total number of arraignments covered because, prior to early 2017, the Public \nDefender Office was not vigilante about tracking appearance ticket arraignments the Office covered. Since early \n2017, the Public Defender Office has been more vigilante about tracking and counting these arraignments.     \n29 \n \n\nLapp looks forward to its eventual implementation because, while the two attorneys hired with \nSettlement funding have diminished the burden of the Public Defender Office’s on-call \nprograms, being on call remains a burden nonetheless. Centralizing arraignments will go far in \nenhancing attorney morale and allowing attorneys to focus on their cases without the disruption \ninherent in on-call arraignment programs.       \n    \n30 \n \n\nIII.  SCHUYLER COUNTY \nSince 2004, Schuyler County has had a full-time Public Defender Office, but it has long been \nunderstaffed and under-resourced. For several years, Schuyler County had a contract with a \nprivate lawyer who worked part-time to represent defendants in conflict cases. But this contract \nconflict defender was even more under-resourced than the Public Defender Office, and she \nstruggled to provide quality representation with her overwhelming caseload. Schuyler County \ndid not have a formal Assigned Counsel Program. Instead, when there were defendants who \ncould not be represented by either the Public Defender Office or the contract conflict defender \nbecause of a conflict, the Public Defender’s Office Manager would call lawyers from a list of \neight private lawyers she knew and ask them to take the assignment. But with this small pool of \nlawyers willing to take Schuyler County assigned cases, it was often challenging to find a lawyer \nwithin a reasonable time frame. Of course, this system also meant that there was no quality \noversight or support for lawyers who were willing to take assigned cases in Schuyler County.  \n \nBeginning in 2013, the Public Defender Office began to effectively use ILS competitive funding \nto increase attorney staff and implement programs to cover arraignments. But this funding was \nlimited, and the Public Defender Office still struggled with high caseloads and a lack of non-\nattorney supports; additionally, Public Defender Office staff were stretched too thin to cover all \narraignments. Moreover, ILS funding was insufficient to allow the County to meaningfully \naddress the severely under-resourced system by which conflict cases were handled.   \n \nThis was the situation in late-2015 when ILS worked with the County to finalize plans for \nimproving quality and providing counsel at arraignment. Just two years later and Schuyler \nCounty now has a better resourced Public Defender Office and a regional Assigned Counsel \nProgram that not only has recruited a large pool of attorneys willing to take assignments in \nSchuyler County, but also provides quality oversight and support for panel attorneys. \nAdditionally, there are now programs in place to cover virtually all Schuyler County \narraignments. This transformation is described in more detail below.  \n \nA.  Quality \n \nThe Settlement’s 2015 Quality Plan allocated $55,956 to Schuyler County for quality \nimprovement initiatives. It was quickly agreed that this funding should be targeted to improving \nthe quality of representation for defendants who the Public Defender Office cannot represent \nbecause of a conflict. With only $55,956 in funding, it was unrealistic to devote some money to \nenhancing resources for the contract conflict defender while simultaneously creating an Assigned \nCounsel Program infrastructure. To resolve this problem, Schuyler County decided to forego its \ncontract with its conflict defender and instead partner with Tompkins County to create a regional \nAssigned Counsel Program to be administered by Tompkins County’s Assigned Counsel \nProgram, which has a full-time experienced Coordinator, Julia Hughes, and a part-time \nSupervising Attorney, Lance Salisbury. Schuyler devoted all the Settlement’s $55,956 quality \nfunding to this initiative. This regional Assigned Counsel Program (“regional ACP”) has been \noperating since April 1, 2016.   \n \nAccording to data received from the regional ACP, from September 1, 2016 through August 31, \n2017, the program has received about 100 new criminal case assignments and about 77 Family \n31 \n \n\nCourt assignments. The regional ACP has approximately 30 panel attorneys who take \nassignments in Schuyler County, which ensures that Schuyler County has enough qualified \nattorneys who have the time and resources needed to handle Schuyler’s conflict cases. Since the \nprogram began in April 2016, there have been two instances in which multiple co-defendants \nwere arrested and in need of assigned counsel. Previously, it would have taken weeks if not \nmonths to find counsel for all these defendants. The regional ACP has been able to ensure that \nqualified counsel is assigned within just one to two days. Just as importantly, the regional ACP \nprovides quality oversight and training opportunities for panel attorneys.   \n \nThrough the structured attorney interviews, ILS learned that the program is functioning well, \nthough attorneys discussed two issues. First, some attorneys reported that the travel to Schuyler \nCounty can be a drawback, particularly for those attorneys who live and work further from \nSchuyler County’s border. Second, while attorneys reported that Julia Hughes is accessible and \nan excellent resource for them, they are more hesitant to reach out to Lance Salisbury because he \nis so busy. During meetings with ILS, Ms. Hughes and Mr. Salisbury acknowledged this issue. \nTo resolve it, it was decided that Caseload Relief II funding would be used to improve the \nregional ACP’s administrative capacity and for paid mentor attorneys. Ms. Hughes and Mr. \nSalisbury have identified some experienced and trustworthy attorneys they have used in the past \nto mentor less experienced attorneys. They believe that using paid mentors will be an effective \nmeans of improving quality oversight and enhancing support for attorneys who take Schuyler \nassignments.    \n \nDespite these issues, there is evidence that the panel attorneys are improving the quality of client \nadvocacy. During ILS’ structured interviews, one attorney reported that he felt like the panel \nattorneys were beginning to “open up the culture there,” meaning that he felt that their advocacy \nwas compelling judges to comply with the law instead of following a “business as usual” \napproach. Mr. Salisbury reports that more zealous advocacy has been a focus of the regional \nACP, and he has seen improvement. He believes that the Schuyler County magistrates are no \nlonger viewing the panel attorneys as “outsiders,” but instead valuing their professionalism and \ncriminal defense knowledge and experience. At the inception of the program, Mr. Salisbury \nurged panel attorneys to file a proceeding in superior court to challenge local magistrates’ \ncommon practice of not conducting legally required preliminary hearings. The strategy worked \nand the magistrates now consistently uphold this right. The regional ACP attorneys have also \nsuccessfully pushed back against a common local magistrate practice of sentencing defendants \nwithout first ordering that a pre-sentence investigation report be completed, even though the law \nrequires that such reports be done prior to sentencing unless waived by the defendant.  \n \nMr. Salisbury and Ms. Hughes report that they have received positive feedback about the panel \nattorneys’ professionalism and advocacy from Schuyler County magistrates and the Schuyler \nCounty Court judge. They have even heard from some former clients, who praised the \nperformance of their assigned counsel. Mr. Salisbury believes that the regional ACP panel \nattorneys have earned credibility with the judiciary and the District Attorney’s Office, which has \nenhanced their ability to negotiate for favorable dispositions for their clients.  \n \nMr. Salisbury told ILS that with Settlement funding, he is focusing on the following four \npriorities to continue the progress the regional ACP has made: \n32 \n \n\n \nWorking the case:  Mr. Salisbury is encouraging attorneys to “work the case.” He is trying \nto build a culture of active litigation and, where appropriate, push back against unfair and \nunjust judicial and prosecutorial policies and practices. The Settlement funding allows Mr. \nSalisbury to remind panel attorneys that there is now funding available to enable them to \nspend more time and resources on cases.   \n \nEarly client contact and communication: Mr. Salisbury recognizes that effective client \ncommunication is vital to quality representation. He reports that some attorneys now note \non vouchers a reason for failing to meet with a client right away, which he views as a \nsignal that attorneys are beginning to internalize the importance of immediate and effective \nclient communication.  \n \nUse of non-attorney professional supports: Now that there is more funding for non-\nattorney support services, Mr. Salisbury and Ms. Hughes are urging attorneys to use \ninvestigators, interpreters, expert witnesses, sentencing/mitigation advocates, social \nworkers and other non-attorney supports where appropriate. Toward that end, on July 19, \n2017, the regional ACP conducted a meeting with the panel attorneys, during which they \ninformed the panel of money available from caseload relief funding for non-attorney \nprofessional support services. They also had a CLE presentation entitled the “The Nuts and \nBolts of Effective Sentencing Advocacy” conducted by Amy Knibbs and Kelly Gonzalez \nof the Center for Community Alternatives (CCA). Caseload Relief I funding has made it \npossible for Schuyler panel attorneys to access CCA’s defense-based sentencing advocacy \nservices. This CLE served both as an introduction to CCA and a training on how to \neffectively advocate for a favorable case disposition.     \n \n Training: Caseload Relief II funding will allow the regional ACP to enhance training \nopportunities for its panel attorneys. Mr. Salisbury and Ms. Hughes are in the process of \nsurveying panel attorneys to see what training opportunities would be most relevant to \ntheir practice. In the meantime, using ILS distribution funding, the regional ACP has \nconducted ongoing CLE programs for panel attorneys, including an August 2017 CLE on \ndefending DWI cases. Because these CLE programs are conducted in Ithaca, New York, \nthe regional ACP is trying a webinar format for future CLEs as a means of increasing \naccess to these programs. They will try this first with a CLE on cell-phone diagnostics \nscheduled for this fall.  \n \nWhile the Schuyler Public Defender Office did not receive any of the Settlement’s Quality \nImprovement funding, the Office, under Wes Roe’s leadership, is effectively using the \nSettlement’s Caseload Relief and Counsel at Arraignment funding to improve the quality of \ndefense. The Caseload Relief funding has allowed the Public Defender Office to contract with \nOpportunities, Alternatives, and Resources of Tompkins County (O.A.R.), a community-based, \nnon-profit organization that has long advocated for and assisted incarcerated and formerly \nincarcerated individuals in Tompkins County. With $50,765 in Caseload Relief I funding, \nO.A.R. has hired an advocate to work solely in Schuyler County. The advocate visits individuals \nat the jail to assist in communicating with their attorney, helps detained individuals complete the \napplication for assigned counsel if it was not completed at arraignment, and helps connect people \n33 \n \n\nsoon to be released with housing, treatment, and public assistance. Mr. Roe reports that since \nAugust 1, 2017, this advocate has been visiting the jail at least three days per week and is already \nmeeting with local county officials to develop a protocol which will allow incarcerated people to \napply for public benefits prior to their release instead of waiting until after their release.        \n     \nAs discussed below, the Public Defender Office has also improved the quality of representation \nby implementing programs to ensure that defendants are represented at arraignment and that \neligibility for assignment of counsel is determined promptly.     \n \nB.  Counsel at Arraignment \nBy late 2015, when the Settlement’s 2015 Counsel at Arraignment Plan was developed, the \nSchuyler County Public Defender Office had already implemented programs to provide for some \nlimited arraignment coverage. In late 2013, the County received an ILS Counsel at First \nAppearance Grant, which bolstered staff availability so that the Schuyler County Public \nDefender could cover off-hour arraignments that occur during business hours. In late 2014, the \nPublic Defender Office took advantage of ILS’ Upstate Caseload Relief and Quality \nImprovement grant to hire a part-time assistant public defender to cover off-hour arraignments \nthat occur in the evening (i.e., 5:00 p.m. to 11:30 p.m.). The staff made available from these two \ngrants also ensures that the Public Defender Office can appear at and provide arraignment \nrepresentation during the regular court sessions at which the District Attorney Office is present \n(DA court sessions).    \n \nThis left three gaps in arraignment representation: 1) arraignments that occur during non-DA \ncourt sessions; 2) overnight off-hour arraignments; and 3) weekend off-hour arraignments. The \n2015 Counsel at Arraignment Plan was designed to close these gaps by: obtaining law \nenforcement cooperation to issue appearance tickets for DA court sessions; coordinating with the \nSheriff’s Department for the detention of individuals arrested overnight so they can be arraigned \nthe following morning with defense counsel present; and implementing a weekend on-call \nprogram for off-hour arraignments that occur during the daytime on weekends and holidays. \n  \nAs set forth in ILS’s 2016 update report, by late October 2015, the Public Defender Office, \nworking with the Schuyler County Sheriff William Yessman, had obtained agreement from all \nlocal law enforcement agencies to issue appearance tickets for DA court sessions, and by \nNovember 2015, ILS had coordinated with the Governor’s Counsel’s Office to ensure that New \nYork State law enforcement agencies also issue appearance tickets for DA court sessions. By late \n2015, the Sherriff had also begun holding overnight people who are arrested and not issued \nappearance tickets. In early March 2016, the Public Defender Office began its weekend on-call \nprogram. Thus, by March 2016, Schuyler County had implemented the programs needed to \nprovide representation to all arrested people.   \n \nILS received data from the Public Defender Office regarding the number of arraignments at \nwhich they appeared between November 10, 2016 and June 30, 2017. According to this data, the \nPublic Defender Office’s counsel at arraignment program covered 210 arraignments during this \ntime frame.  \n  \n34 \n \n\nIn addition to implementing its counsel at arraignment programs, the Public Defender Office \nworked with ILS to develop protocols to track any missed arraignments. To do so, the Public \nDefender Office receives notification of off-hour arraignments from three possible sources: local \ndispatch; local magistrates; and the District Attorney’s office. This way, if there is one problem \nof notification (such as the magistrate fails to notify the Public Defender Office of an \narraignment), there are two back-up systems. Additionally, the Public Defender Office has \nincluded on its application for assignment of counsel a question about whether the applicant was \nrepresented at arraignment.  \n \nAs a result of this protocol, the Public Defender Office has tracked 21 missed arraignments \nbetween October 1, 2016 and June 30, 2017. Of these, 9 were the result of a single New York \nState Police arrest on November 2, 2016; all 9 arrested persons were charged with Unlawful \nManufacture of Methamphetamine in the Third Degree. The Public Defender Office learned of \nthis arrest prior to arraignment, and staff stayed on-call later than usual to handle the \narraignments. But the Office never received any notification of the arraignments. The Public \nDefender Office later learned that the arraignments had occurred overnight, at 2 a.m. in the Town \nof Dix. The Public Defender Office communicated with the regional ACP to ensure the prompt \nassignment of counsel. The Public Defender Office also informed ILS of what had occurred. In \nearly January 2017, ILS identified this issue during an update conference call with the Hurrell-\nHarring parties. The Governor’s Office agreed to address it with New York State Police. Since \nthen, we have not heard of additional problems with New York State Police compliance with \ncounsel at arraignment initiatives, though we continue to be attentive to this issue. \n \nOf the remaining 12 missed arraignments, 10 were overnight arraignments, 8 of which occurred \non either a Saturday or Sunday overnight. To reduce the incidence of missed arraignments, Mr. \nRoe is exploring the possibility of implementing an on-call program for Saturday and Sunday \novernights (9:00 p.m. to 9:00 a.m.).7 He is considering doing so by either using private attorneys \n(though recruiting private attorneys is a challenge because only two criminal defense attorneys \nlive in Schuyler County), or including this on-call responsibility as part of the job responsibilities \nfor the staff attorney that his Office is slotted to hire with Caseload Relief II funding.       \n \nIn the meantime, the Public Defender Office continues to mitigate the harm of these missed \novernight arraignments by working with the courts to ensure that any missed arraignment cases \nare calendared for a court appearance the following morning with Public Defender Office staff \npresent to address issues regarding pre-trial release and assignment of counsel. ILS will continue \nto work with the Public Defender Office on this issue.   \n    \nThe Public Defender Office has used its counsel at arraignment programs to facilitate \nimplementation of the ILS’ Criteria and Procedures to Determine Assigned Counsel Eligibility, \nwhich the Office implemented in April 2016. Now the Public Defender Office attorneys bring \napplications for assignment of counsel with them to every arraignment and, in most instances, \n                                                           \n7 As set forth in ILS’ 2016 update report, the Settlement anticipated that the County might not be able to obtain law \nenforcement agreement to issue appearance tickets for DA court sessions only, and therefore provided $161,000 in \nfunding for the Public Defender Office to hire two additional staff attorneys (one full-time and one part-time). \nBecause there has been cooperation from law enforcement to issue appearance tickets for DA court sessions, this \nfunding has not been utilized.    \n35 \n \n\ncomplete the application with the defendant at arraignment. This allows for a prompt \ndetermination as to a person’s eligibility for assignment of counsel. As noted in ILS’ January \n2017 report, The Impact of Eligibility Standards in Five Upstate Counties, Schuyler County has \nrealized a small increase in the number of people deemed eligible for assignment of counsel. Mr. \nRoe attributes this increase to his office’s counsel at arraignment programs, and the data suggests \nthat he is correct.8 Since Public Defender Office staff are now present at virtually every \narraignment, they explain to defendants that they are entitled to assigned counsel and the \nimportance of having counsel, they encourage defendants to apply and assist them in applying \nwhenever possible, and they bring the application back to the office saving defendants from \nhaving to submit it themselves. Defendants are no longer falling through the cracks, but instead \nare having immediate contact with counsel and applying for counsel if they cannot afford a \nlawyer.              \n \n   \n                                                           \n8 See The Impact of Eligibility Standards in Five Upstate Counties, at 23-24. This report is available at: \nhttps://www.ils.ny.gov/files/Hurrell-\nHarring/Eligibility/Research/The%20Impact%20of%20Eligibility%20Standards%20in%20Five%20Upstate%20Ne\nw%20York%20Counties%20-%20ILS%20report%20January%202017.pdf.   \n36 \n \n\nIV.  SUFFOLK COUNTY \n \nWith a population of almost 1.5 million people,9 Suffolk County is the most populous Hurrell-\nHarring county. Not surprisingly, it also has the largest criminal caseload of all the Hurrell-\nHarring counties.10 Geographically, Suffolk County is more like two counties than one. The \nCounty is 86 miles long and about 24 miles wide. The western portion of the County, called the \nWest End, is more densely populated and more suburban. The eastern portion of the County, \ncalled the East End, is less densely populated, more bucolic, and a popular vacation destination \nin the spring and summer months. The East End splits into two peninsulas, called the North Fork \nand South Fork, which surround the Peconic and Gardiner Bays. In the late spring and summer \nmonths (the “in-season”) the East End is crowded with vacationers, and travel time increases \nsignificantly.   \n \nThe County’s court system reflects the bi-furcated nature of Suffolk County. Since 1964, the \nCounty has operated a District Court, which was established pursuant to the Uniform District \nCourt Act to have jurisdiction over criminal and civil cases of the West End’s five towns. All the \nDistrict Court’s criminal cases are heard in the Cohalan Court Complex in Central Islip, where \n22 judges preside over 21 different District Court parts. Suffolk County’s County Court operates \nin Riverhead in the Cromarty Court Complex. Adjacent to the Cromarty Court Complex is one of \nSuffolk County’s jail, which holds pre-trial detainees.11 Riverhead is about 30 miles from Central \nIslip, but travel time is unpredictable: when traffic is light, the drive from Central Islip to \nRiverhead takes about 40 minutes, but when traffic is heavy, it can take anywhere between one \nto two hours. \n \nUnlike the West End, the East End justice courts have not taken advantage of the Uniform \nDistrict Court Act, but instead continue to maintain jurisdiction over criminal and civil matters. \nThere are nine town and village courts that handle criminal cases, one of which (Shelter Island) \nis accessible only by ferry.          \n \nSuffolk County’s large criminal caseload and its unique geography have posed challenges for its \ntwo providers of mandated representation: The Legal Aid Society of Suffolk County, Inc. \n(SCLAS), which is the primary provider in all criminal cases except homicide cases; and the \nSuffolk County Assigned Counsel Defender Plan (ACDP) which is the primary provider for \nhomicide cases and the conflict provider for all other criminal cases. The large volume of cases \nhas historically meant high caseloads for both providers, but particularly for the SCLAS. The \nCounty’s geography has required the SCLAS to maintain two offices, one in Central Islip and \none in Riverhead. It also means that felony cases that originate in District Court may end up \nbeing prosecuted 30 miles away in County Court, with the client housed in a jail miles from \nwhere the case originated. For the ACDP, the County’s unique geography can mean many miles \n                                                           \n9 2010 Census Data, available here: https://pad.human.cornell.edu/profiles/Suffolk.pdf. \n \n10 In 2015, Suffolk County’s providers of mandated representation handled a combined total of more than 30,000 \ncriminal cases.  \n \n11 Some pre-trial detainees – usually those charged with misdemeanors – are held at a facility in Yaphank, NY. \n37 \n \n\nof travel for assigned counsel lawyers who represent a client in District Court, only to have the \ncase transferred to County Court upon indictment.   \n \nThe County’s geography has also posed challenges in implementing the county’s counsel at \narraignment programs, particularly in the East End where the courts vary significantly in the \nnumber of cases prosecuted and where it can take hours to travel from a court on one of the \n“forks” to a court on the other. \n \nIn the face of these challenges, the SCLAS and the ACDP have worked thoughtfully and \ncreatively to implement the Settlement and provide high quality, client-centered representation to \npeople charged with a criminal offense who cannot afford a lawyer. Below, we describe their \nprogress and ongoing challenges.               \n \nA.  Quality \n \nWith the funds provided pursuant to the Settlement, specifically $1,116,618 in Quality funding \nand $5,476,712 in Caseload Relief funding, both the SCLAS and the ACDP have made \nsignificant progress toward meeting the quality objectives set forth in the November 2015 \nQuality Plan.  \n \n1.  Legal Aid Society (SCLAS) \n \nAs the primary provider of mandated representation, SCLAS handles most of Suffolk County’s \npublicly funded criminal caseload. With limited County resources, SCLAS attorneys have \ntraditionally carried high caseloads and had limited access to non-attorney professional supports \nlike investigators, experts, social workers and sentencing advocates to aid in the representation of \ntheir clients. Prior to Settlement funding, SCLAS had some training resources but no formal \ncurriculum.  \n \nAdditionally, SCLAS has repeatedly lost some of its most promising or experienced attorneys \ndue to poor compensation, lack of a pension, few opportunities for professional advancement \nwithin the organization, and burdensome workloads. Indeed, during the structured interviews, \none attorney told ILS that they lost 7 District Court attorneys in a short timeframe due to these \nissues. In repeated conversations with staff attorneys and management, ILS has heard that the \nlow rate of compensation is crippling for many attorneys in a County with a relatively high cost \nof living.12 One attorney told ILS that “attorneys want to stay” but simply cannot afford to. \nDuring these conversations, ILS also learned that SCLAS did not have a modern computer \nnetwork or IT infrastructure and that attorneys felt that they were at a disadvantage without an \noffice shared drive or motion bank, making their work inefficient.  \n \nIt was apparent that SCLAS needed to focus on bolstering its infrastructure, layering in \nsupervision, lowering caseloads, increasing access to non-attorney supports, and retaining quality \nattorneys. Starting with the initial Quality funding and continuing with Caseload Relief I \nfunding, SCLAS Attorney-in-Charge, Laurette Mulry, worked with ILS and key members of her \n                                                           \n12 See Long Island’s High Cost of Living Can’t Go On, Newsday, Editorial Opinion, April 24, 2015, available at: \nhttp://www.newsday.com/opinion/editorial/long-island-s-high-cost-of-living-can-t-go-on-1.10328771.  \n38 \n \n\nmanagement team to devise plans to address these needs. The result has been an organization \nthat has begun an admirable and significant transformation.  \n \nStaffing, Supervision, and Overall Infrastructure \n \nStaffing, supervision, and overall infrastructure improvement are at the forefront of these plans. \nSCLAS recognized the importance of retaining high quality, dedicated attorneys already \nemployed by the organization as well as the need to add new zealous advocates to reduce \ncaseloads. SCLAS also needed to add non-attorney professional support staff to ensure proper \naccess to investigators, interpreters, social workers, and other administrative support. Further, \nSCLAS added new layers of supervision and oversight to foster high quality representation.  \n \nSCLAS developed a plan to restructure the criminal practice by implementing an \ninterdisciplinary team approach in District Court. Attorneys will now be divided into five teams \nconsisting of 7-14 attorneys who will be overseen by a supervising attorney and a mentor \nattorney, and supported by an investigator, social worker, and paralegal. This new team approach \nbrings together the work of attorneys and non-attorney professionals to effectively address the \nunderlying causes and resulting consequences of an individual’s contact with the criminal justice \nsystem. There are many potential collateral consequences that may result from an individual’s \narrest, consequences that can have a ripple effect on families and communities. Identifying \npotential mental health issues, substance abuse issues, domestic violence issues, parenting and \nother issues and connecting clients with a wide array of social services to address these issues, \nbenefit the entire criminal justice system. Moreover, this approach will also enable the SCLAS to \npro-actively address factors that contribute to re-offending, thereby reducing recidivism.   \n \nWith the initial Quality funding, SCLAS began to lay the groundwork for improving the overall \ninfrastructure. With subsequent Caseload Relief funding, SCLAS is now working toward fully \nrealizing this goal. \n \na.  Attorney Staffing \n \nTo address the issue of their historically high-rate of mid-level attorney attrition, SCLAS has \nemployed two strategies to encourage retention of highly-qualified staff. First, with $240,000 in \nQuality funding, SCLAS created a retention fund and assessed 63 staff attorneys using an \n“aspirational grid” developed by the SCLAS management team.13 From this review, they \ndistributed one-time meritorious stipends in quarterly installments to 35 staff attorneys. To date, \nSCLAS reports that all attorneys receiving the meritorious stipends are still employed. Because \nof this success, SCLAS plans to expand the retention fund with Caseload Relief II funding. \nSecond, SCLAS is committed to creating new opportunities for professional development within \nthe organization by promoting attorneys to supervisory and mentor roles. With Caseload Relief II \nfunding, SCLAS will create more opportunities for attorneys to progress from misdemeanor to \nfelony level representation. The implementation of meritorious stipends and the increased \nopportunities for professional growth within the organization are already starting to have a \npositive effect on staff morale thereby encouraging attorneys to continue working for the \norganization. \n                                                           \n13 This is described in the 2016 update report.  \n39 \n \n\n \nILS’ review of SCLAS’ caseloads made it abundantly clear that they need to hire more attorneys \nto ensure attorneys have enough time to perform tasks necessary for quality representation on \neach case. To address this issue, SCLAS focused first on reducing its high District Court \ncaseloads where attorneys were averaging 500 cases per year. Using funds from Caseload Relief \nI, SCLAS began by actively recruiting and hiring 23 new attorneys. Four started on August 1, \n2017 as the “Advance Team;” 19 more started on September 1, 2017 as SCLAS’ first ever \n“class” of new attorneys. SCLAS has never previously had the ability to actively recruit and hire \nsuch a large class of attorneys, and they worked to hire qualified attorneys from diverse \nbackgrounds who are committed to the defense of low income clients. These attorneys are \nundergoing SCLAS’ newly developed “new attorney training” described below and are \npreparing to start work on their new teams.  \n \n \nSCLAS class of new attorneys during a training session, September 2017 \n \nWith anticipated funding from Caseload Relief II, SCLAS plans to focus on hiring new staff for \nits felony caseloads and the County Court in the coming year. \n \nWith the addition of new attorney staff and the retention of experienced, committed attorneys, \nSCLAS has grown its criminal attorney staff from 75 to 98 in less than a year. \n \nb.  Supervision \n \nSCLAS is bolstering its supervision and quality oversight with a combination of part-time hires \nand promoting from within. Using $150,000 in Quality funds, this year SCLAS added two more \nretired, highly respected attorneys as part-time Quality Control Supervisors who provide quality \n40 \n \n\ncontrol oversight where most needed, bringing them to a total of three.14 Because the District \nCourt Bureau is expanding the Quality Control Supervisors are currently working there. \nHowever, when Caseload Relief II funding is used to expand the County Court Bureau, the \nQuality Control Supervisors can be dispatched to that Bureau. Using Caseload Relief I funding, \nSCLAS is in the process of elevating 12 experienced staff attorneys to the roles of Supervisor, \nTeam Leader, or Team Mentor for the District Court teams. SCLAS also elevated two \nsupervising attorneys to East End Bureau Chief and District Court Co-Bureau Chief; and four \nstaff attorneys to fill the roles of County Court Assistant Bureau Chief, East End Assistant \nBureau Chief, and two District Court Co-Assistant Bureau Chiefs.  \n \nMs. Mulry told ILS that in late September 2017, she held a leadership meeting with 22 \nsupervisors, including existing supervisors and new members of the leadership team. Ms. Mulry \nsaid it was remarkable to see everyone working together in one room. Whereas previously \nSCLAS was criticized for not having enough support for staff attorneys, now there are layers of \nsupervision and attorneys have places to turn. These promotions not only enhance supervision, \nsupport, and oversight of a growing staff, they also provide increased opportunities for \nprofessional development within the organization. This reinvigorated staff and boosted morale. \n \nc.  Non-Attorney Supports \n \nDuring the structured interviews, several attorneys discussed the need for increased access to \nnon-attorney supports, including investigators, social workers, experts, interpreters, and \nparalegals. SCLAS is using a combination of Quality and Caseload Relief funding to address \neach of these needs. Indeed, the new staffing described below will provide each of the new \nDistrict Court teams with a dedicated investigator, social worker, and paralegal. SCLAS is using \nadditional funding for contracts with experts and interpreters.  \n \nMore than one attorney told ILS that while they utilize the investigators who are currently on \nstaff to varying degrees, the organization needs more to meet the requirements of all SCLAS \nattorneys. Recognizing this need, as well as the need for investigation oversight and training, \nSCLAS developed a plan to create a new Investigator Unit. To lead the new Unit, SCLAS \npromoted a current investigator, Mark Sheridan, to Supervising Investigator. They next hired \nthree additional investigators who came on staff in February 2017, September 2017, and October \n2017 respectively to increase attorney access while creating a cohesive, well-trained \ninvestigations team.  \n \nSCLAS also bolstered their existing social work bureau, creating a new Social Work Unit to \nprovide holistic support to SCLAS clients by connecting them with critical resources as well as \nworking with attorneys to provide plea and sentencing advocacy services. This will enhance the \nnew team structure by ensuring there are enough social workers to provide these essential \nservices to each team of attorneys. With combined funding from Quality and Caseload Relief, \nSCLAS elevated a staff social worker to the role of Supervisor and hired a new social worker. \nSCLAS further plans to elevate another staff social worker to a Senior Social Worker position \nand hire an additional entry-level social worker. One SCLAS attorney told ILS that clients \n                                                           \n14 SCLAS established this model by contracting initially with one Quality Control Attorney funded by an ILS \ncompetitive grant funding. When the model was a success, they sought Quality funds to expand this program. \n41 \n \n\nconsistently obtain better dispositions when a social worker is involved in the case. She admitted \nto being hesitant to use the social workers at first, but when she saw the results she realized the \nimportant role they can play in a case. Now, the attorney told ILS, she uses social workers often \nand loves to work with them on her cases. \n \nDuring the structured interviews, ILS heard an unequivocal desire for paralegal support. While \nSCLAS has some legal secretaries and other data support staff, they have never had the resources \nfor dedicated paralegals on staff. One attorney told us she felt like the District Attorney has an \nadvantage because they have paralegals to respond to motions which allows the Assistant \nDistrict Attorneys to focus on investigating and building their cases. Now, with Caseload Relief I \nfunding, SCLAS is hiring five new paralegals, one to support each new District Court team.  \n \nOne area in which SCLAS has consistently faced challenges is retaining outside experts for \nconsultation and testimony. Historically SCLAS did not have their own expert budget line, so \nattorneys had to apply to the court for funding from the County’s 18-b budget. During the \nstructured interviews, ILS learned from attorneys that many judges cap expert fees, or limit their \nuse of experts altogether, or both. Many attorneys said that they have a difficult time finding \nexperts who will work with SCLAS because they know it is it difficult to get paid from the \nCounty’s 18-b budget. One attorney illustrated this problem with a story: he had retained a \nhighly-regarded expert who produced a report and was expected to provide compelling testimony \nfor his client at a hearing. However, the expert did not get paid and refused to testify forcing the \nattorney to retain someone less qualified. Ultimately the attorney lost the hearing.  \n \nRecognizing this as a critical issue, SCLAS is using some of the $50,000 in Quality funding for \nretainer agreements with a forensic psychologist, a forensic neuropsychologist, and a \ntoxicologist. SCLAS also created a list of qualified experts for both consultation and testimony. \nSCLAS reports that attorneys now use this new resource for consultation which they previously \nwould not have been able to do. SCLAS cited the example of a forensic psychiatric examination \nand report that was recently authorized for a client which revealed that the client’s problematic \nbehavior was the result of advanced Multiple Sclerosis, which had previously been undiagnosed. \nSCLAS also told ILS that these funds have been indispensable in securing admission to \ntreatment programs and securing appropriate housing and medical treatment for incarcerated \nclients. SCLAS intends to supplement this expert fund with Caseload Relief II funding to \ncontinue to expand attorney access to these critical expert services.  \n \nSuffolk County residents come from diverse backgrounds, and more than twenty languages are \ncommonly spoken in the County. However, until recently SCLAS attorneys had limited access to \ninterpreters to communicate with their clients outside of court appearances. Any applications for \ninterpreter services were made to the court with funding from the County’s 18-b budget. \nOtherwise, SCLAS attorneys told ILS, they had to rely on other SCLAS staff who are fluent or \nsemi-fluent in languages other than English. However, with $15,000 in Quality funding, SCLAS \nis working with an agency which provides interpretation services on a per diem basis. SCLAS \nreports that because of this funding, they recently authorized funding for an American Sign \nLanguage interpreter. Previously this type of service would be difficult to access thus inhibiting \nclient communication. SCLAS also intends to use Caseload Relief II funding to hire a Spanish \ninterpreter to further facilitate client communication. \n42 \n \n\n \nAnother critical need for staff attorneys was access to electronic legal research. Using Quality \nfunding, SCLAS reports that as of October 1, 2017, all criminal attorneys including the new \nattorney hires will have access to LEXIS for online legal research. \n \nd.  Administration \n \nRevamping SCLAS’ infrastructure would be incomplete without providing the administrative \nand management backbone necessary to promote efficiency and quality oversight. Increased staff \nwill inevitably produce an increased demand for administrative support. At the same time, there \nare external demands for data and reporting as well as the inherent need to navigate multiple \nfunding streams from the County and State.  \n \nToward that end, SCLAS is using Caseload Relief I funds to hire six new data entry support \nstaff, elevating four existing support staff to the role of Supervisor, and hiring a new Account \nAssistant. Further, SCLAS created a new management role, Chief Legal Operating Officer, and \nelevated an existing Bureau Chief, Sabato Caponi, to fill this role. Mr. Caponi is responsible for \noverseeing day-to-day legal operations and works directly with Ms. Mulry to implement all grant \nand Hurrell-Harring funding and initiatives. Further, Mr. Caponi oversees the work of the new \ndirectors (described below) and assists in recruiting and hiring new staff. This new role adds a \nlayer of managerial oversight necessary for SCLAS’ growing infrastructure. \n  \nFinally, aware of the need to upgrade their technological capacity, SCLAS hired a full-time in-\nhouse IT Director in August 2017.  \n \nWith this comprehensive plan for hiring and restructuring, SCLAS is on track to having the \nattorneys, supervision, and support necessary to provide client-centered, quality representation.  \n \nTraining \n \nWhereas previously SCLAS relied on a more ad hoc training approach, Ms. Mulry and her team \nrecognize that it is imperative to develop in-house training expertise and curriculum. With \nCaseload Relief I funding, SCLAS hired its first Training Director, Kent Moston, in November \n2016. In June 2017, SCLAS also promoted three attorneys to the new roles of Legal Director, \nTrial Director, and Outreach Director. This new team of directors is responsible for developing a \ntraining curriculum, keeping staff updated on developments in the law, identifying staff to send \nto external, intensive hands-on trainers, supporting staff attorneys with trials, and developing a \nprogram for community outreach and education which incorporates staff attorneys. In less than \none year’s time, SCLAS went from no formalized training structure to a team of directors \ndevoted to ensuring that SCLAS attorneys have the training and support necessary for quality \ncriminal defense representation. \n  \nShortly after Mr. Moston assumed the role of Training Director, he began meeting with small \ngroups of six SCLAS attorneys at a time to discuss relevant training issues. Notably because of \nthe lack of meeting space, he could not meet with larger groups consistently (the space issue will \nbe addressed below). However, Mr. Moston said he appreciated the smaller groups because it \n43 \n \n\ngave him the opportunity to get to know the SCLAS staff as well as to identify their most \npressing training needs. During our structured interviews, attorneys in SCLAS’ Riverhead Office \nreported that they felt that their access to training was much more limited than those attorneys \nhoused in Central Islip. Even though SCLAS hosted some lunchtime CLEs in Central Islip, the \nRiverhead Office is more than 30 miles away making it impractical to get to and from the \ntraining during an East End or County Court attorney’s lunch hour. Very few trainings were held \nin Riverhead. With the hiring of Mr. Moston, SCLAS has already started to address this issue. \nMr. Moston has gone out to the Riverhead Office to meet with groups of attorneys on two \noccasions and will continue to host trainings at the Riverhead Office in the coming year. \n \nAdditionally, with the assistance of the new directors and Mr. Caponi, Mr. Moston developed an \nin-house, comprehensive, 4-week long new attorney training program which was administered to \nboth the Advance Team (August 2017) as well as the new class of attorneys (September 2017). \nThis training is an intensive primer intended to provide a solid foundation for the new attorneys \nbefore they begin working in court. Topics range from accusatory instruments and substantive \nand procedural criminal law issues to crisis recognition and investigations. Throughout the \ntraining period, attorneys visit various courtrooms for observation. Being the first to undergo this \nnew training, the Advance Team provided valuable feedback which allowed the directors to \nfurther improve the curriculum and structure for the new class. SCLAS plan to continue to refine \nthis new attorney training for future hires. \n \nWith $52,571 in Quality funding, SCLAS enhanced its training fund which has allowed the \norganization to send five newly admitted attorneys to external trial training programs, and send \nthe Outreach Director to the prestigious National Legal Aid and Defender Association (NLADA) \nCommunity Oriented Defender Network Annual Conference in June 2017. Additionally, with \nthis funding SCLAS has further developed its training curriculum. The SCLAS has also used this \nfunding to create opportunities to collaborate with the Suffolk County Bar Association (SCBA). \nOn July 20, 2017, SCLAS coordinated a training with the SCBA in which Kent Moston \npresented the Annual Criminal Law Update. Over 50 SCLAS attorneys attended. On August 16, \n2017, Mr. Moston also presented at a joint lunchtime ethics CLE with the Suffolk County \nCriminal Bar Association called “Whose Trial is it Anyway.”  \n \nNew Office Space \n \nThe need for additional space is obvious upon walking into SCLAS’ Central Islip or Riverhead \noffices. Attorneys are doubled and tripled up in offices; some staff do not even have office space \nand must use tables set up as makeshift desks in common areas. In both offices, SCLAS \nattorneys do not have space to meet privately with clients and there are no dedicated conference \nrooms for large group meetings. The lack of resources to expand or make interior improvements \nin existing spaces has contributed to low staff morale. More than one attorney told ILS that they \nworry that the rundown and cramped space in which they currently work leads clients to believe \nthe SCLAS attorneys are less professional than other attorneys and will not provide quality \nrepresentation. Indeed, the desire to feel and appear more professional was a common theme \nduring the structured interviews.  \n \n44 \n \n\nWith the contemplated increase in staffing as described above, SCLAS reached a tipping point. \nUsing Caseload Relief I funding, SCLAS is making the aspiration of adequate space a reality. \nThey located additional office space in an office building located at 320 Carleton Avenue, across \nthe street from the Cohalan Court Complex (the location of District Court and Family Court). As \nof the writing of this report the space has been renovated and SCLAS just moved in. SCLAS \nrelocated some existing staff to this new office thus making room for the new teams at the \ncurrent Central Islip office. This new space also includes a mock court room for training and trial \npreparation. With Caseload Relief II funding, SCLAS will add office space in Riverhead to \nachieve the same goals for the East End and County Court attorneys.  \n \nILS has been impressed with the SCLAS’ thoughtfulness in using Settlement funding. The \nSCLAS has not merely sought to hire more staff; rather, the SCLAS has sought to transform its \norganization and the standard of criminal defense practice by creating a strong infrastructure \nwith multiple levels of quality oversight, by reducing attrition, and by moving toward a team \napproach to defense which fosters collaboration and the use of non-attorney professionals. ILS \nlooks forward to continuing to work with the SCLAS in this transformation.   \n   \n2.  Assigned Counsel Defender Program (ACDP) \n \nSuffolk County’s Assigned Counsel Defender Program (ACDP), which handles all the County’s \nhomicide cases as well as conflicts, is similarly undergoing significant transformation. In the last \nyear, with the support of Quality funding, the ACDP has incorporated, established a Board of \nDirectors, hired a full-time administrator, strengthened its organizational capacity, and moved to \nnew office space. Further, with Caseload Relief funding, the ACDP is expanding panel attorney \naccess to vital non-attorney professional supports, mentoring, and training. Last year, the ACDP \noperated out of the private office of David Besso, the former part-time administrator. Mr. Besso \nwas essentially donating his time to manage the program and was supported by a handful of \ncontract staff members to assist in assignments and voucher review. Now, the ACDP is growing \nto an independent program with oversight and support necessary for a panel of almost 175 \nattorneys.  \n \nCritical to the ACDP’s evolution is building a solid organizational foundation in a professional \nenvironment. The first step the ACDP took was elevating a current administrative assistant, \nStephanie McCall, to the role of Deputy Administrator. During the structured interviews, more \nthan one panel attorney told ILS that Ms. McCall has been an invaluable resource for the panel \nattorneys. One called her “Dave [Besso]’s best investment.” She is well-versed in the day-to-day \nadministration of assignments and vouchers and is a true support to the panel when they need \nassistance. Simultaneously, the ACDP embarked on the search for a full-time administrator. Mr.  \nBesso took an active role in convening a Suffolk County Bar Association (SCBA) hiring \ncommittee and reviewing applicants.15 Daniel Russo stood out as an applicant and received a \nunanimous endorsement from the hiring committee. He took the helm of the ACDP in April \n2017. The same month, the ACDP held a mandatory CLE and panel meeting where Mr. Russo \nwas introduced in his new role. During that meeting, Mr. Russo discussed the Settlement and the \nrelated initiatives and prepared the panel for the many positive upcoming changes, including the \n                                                           \n15 The hiring committee and search process are described in the 2016 Quality Update. \n45 \n \n\nACDP’s intention to hire new non-attorney professional support staff as well as the availability \nof expert funding.   \n \nIn the interim, the ACDP located and secured space in the office building at 320 Carleton \nAvenue, across the street from the Cohalan Court Complex. After a buildout and completing the \nnecessary technological requirements, the ACDP moved into its new space in August 2017.  \n \nUsing Quality funding, in mid-2017, the ACDP contracted with an accountant who has been \nassisting with grants management and building up the organizations’ overall financial \ninfrastructure. The ACDP has also been working with a corporate not-for-profit attorney to assist \nthe ACDP in becoming a 501(C)(3) and, as of June 1, 2017, the ACDP has its own payroll. \nWhereas previously, the ACDP was run by all contract staff who were unsure if they were going \nto get paid on a regular basis, now the ACDP has full-time and part-time employees and it is able \nto offer benefits to eligible staff.  \n \nDuring our structured interviews, panel attorneys identified the long wait for vouchers to be paid \nas a problem, noting that it could take up to six months. With a better infrastructure and staff in \nplace, the ACDP has focused on making the voucher review process more efficient to shorten the \noverall voucher turnaround time. Ultimately vouchers must also be reviewed and processed by \nthe judge, the County Attorney’s Office and the County Comptroller but the ACDP hopes that by \nmaking their review process more effective, the overall turnaround time will decrease. It appears \nto be working; at a recent panel meeting, an attorney noted that it took only 8 weeks for him to \nreceive payment on a large trial voucher.    \n \nIn addition to administrative growth and support, the ACDP is working to ensure that its panel \nattorneys are qualified and have access to non-attorney professional supports and training. There \nare still significant steps to take in this area, but Mr. Russo and Ms. McCall have developed \nplans to get to know the panel attorneys and make resources available. One attorney told ILS \nduring the structured interviews that if the process to get an expert were more streamlined, he \nwould be more likely to use one. With Caseload Relief I funding, the ACDP is developing such a \nprocess. At the April 2017 panel meeting, Mr. Russo emphasized the availability of expert \nfunding and encouraged attorneys to utilize such funds on their cases. Mr. Russo reported that \nhaving this funding was critical to a homicide case that a panel attorney recently tried.  \n \nFurther, in August 2017, the ACDP used Caseload Relief I funding to hire a full-time Spanish \ninterpreter. Mr. Russo reports that this interpreter has provided interpretation services for \nattorneys when they meet with their in-custody and out-of-custody clients – something that never \npreviously occurred. Multiple panel attorneys told ILS that access to an investigator who will \nprovide services on their cases without fear of not getting paid is critical. One attorney told ILS \nthat he had found a good investigator, but could not continue to use him because of difficulty in \ngetting the investigator paid in a timely manner. Waiting for a court to authorize use of an \ninvestigator also creates a concerning delay in initiating case investigations, during which time \ncritical evidence might disappear. The ACDP is addressing this with Caseload Relief funds by \nhiring a full-time investigator. The ACDP is currently searching for a qualified candidate and \nhopes to have someone on staff and accessible to panel attorneys by the end of this year.   \n \n46 \n \n\nThe ACDP is also bringing a full-time social worker on staff who will be available to help \nconnect assigned clients to services and programs and assist with overall advocacy. As of the \nwriting of this report, the ACDP was still in the process of interviewing, and had identified at \nleast one potential candidate for the position. Prior to this, ILS learned, most attorneys have had \nto rely solely on the court to connect clients to services and programs. With a full-time social \nworker on staff, panel attorneys will be able to engage in defense-based social work advocacy to \nassist in getting better dispositions and help clients with any collateral consequences. One panel \nattorney told ILS he would certainly take advantage of this type of non-attorney professional \nsupport as the real goal is “to save their life.” \n \nAt a September 2017 CLE and panel meeting, Mr. Russo introduced another valuable non-\nattorney support available to the panel – a contract with the Consulting Project for sentencing \nadvocacy and mitigation investigation. Reynaldo Cusicanqui, founder and Executive Director of \nConsulting Project, presented the forensic and mitigation services that his organization can \nprovide to assist in pre-plea and pre-sentence advocacy. At this meeting, there was an \nenthusiastic response from the panel about this service. The first question a panel member asked \nwas, “why wouldn’t I use you in all of my cases?”  \n \nUnderstanding that panel oversight and supervision is essential to ensuring quality \nrepresentation, Mr. Russo has expressed his commitment to getting to know the panel attorneys \nand observing them in court as much as possible. But, with his other administrative duties and \nthe sheer size of the panel that is not always possible. As a result, Mr. Russo is using Caseload \nRelief funding to recruit two experienced, respected attorneys to contract with the ACDP to \nserve as part-time Quality Control attorneys. Additionally, Mr. Besso is serving as a mentor to \nboth Mr. Russo in his role as administrator, and to the panel for help with legal and strategic \nissues. Further, with Caseload Relief II funding, Mr. Russo intends to contract with an additional \nwell-respected attorney to serve as a resource attorney to the panel. \n   \nDuring the structured interviews, multiple panel attorneys told ILS that they would like to see \nmore trainings, including more skill-building trainings that will prepare them for trial. In addition \nto the existing, bi-annual mandatory CLEs the ACDP hosts, Caseload Relief II funding will \ninclude resources to send panel attorneys to hands-on intensive trainings as well as to allow the \nACDP to host more local trainings targeted to address panel attorney needs.  \n \nBuilding a program also involves building comradery and morale amongst the panel members. \nIndeed, from the structured interviews it is apparent that, while the panel attorneys have \ncolleagues to whom they can turn for advice and support, there has not been a central place to \nbuild this sense of collegiality. Accordingly, the ACDP is working on building panel \ncommunication and morale. They have a new website which includes all necessary forms and \ninformation, they have staff to ensure that panel attorneys’ questions are addressed in a timely \nfashion and, as mentioned previously, process vouchers and paperwork more efficiently. At the \nSeptember 2017 panel meeting, Mr. Russo also presented awards to three panel attorneys to \nrecognize their outstanding advocacy and litigation on behalf of assigned clients. Mr. Russo told \nILS that he intends to continue to publicly recognize panel members who provide quality \nrepresentation to boost panel morale and encourage client advocacy.  \n \n47 \n \n\nB.  Counsel at Arraignment \n \nAs set forth in our 2015 Counsel at Arraignment Plan and 2016 update report, the 1964 creation \nof a District Court has facilitated having counsel at arraignment for West End defendants, \nparticularly since the vast majority of all Suffolk County arraignments occur in this District \nCourt. There are two parts in the District Court that conduct arraignments: D-11, for defendants \nwho are detained at arrest and arraigned the next day; and the Street Appearance Part (SAP), for \ndefendants who are issued an appearance ticket upon their arrest and scheduled for arraignment \non a specific date. D-11 operates seven days per week so that no defendant is detained for more \nthan 24 hours awaiting arraignment; SAP operates five days per week. The SCLAS has \ntraditionally staffed D-11, covering arraignments for defendants when there is no conflict. In \n2015, through a combination of funding from ILS’ Counsel at First Appearance competitive \ngrant and ILS Distribution #5, the ACDP began staffing SAP and also began staffing D-11 to \nrepresent defendants when there is a conflict with the SCLAS.16 Thus, there is counsel available \nto represent all defendants who are arraigned in the District Court. Additionally, the SCLAS has \ntraditionally covered all arraignments that occur in the West End village courts, using attorneys \nwho are assigned to these village courts and regularly staff all scheduled court sessions. \n \nRegarding the East End courts, the SCLAS has traditionally assigned attorneys to provide \narraignment coverage in Riverhead and Southampton Town Courts, which are the East End’s \nhighest volume courts, accounting for about 70% of East End arraignments. In 2013, using \nfunding from an ILS Counsel at First Appearance competitive grant, the SCLAS expanded this \narraignment program to Southold and East Hampton Town Courts, hiring two full-time attorneys \nto cover all arraignments conducted on weekdays. As for the remainder of East End justice \ncourts that handle criminal cases – Quogue Village Court, West Hampton Beach Village Court, \nSouthampton Village Court, Sag Harbor Village Court, and Shelter Island Town Court – SCLAS \nwas only able to cover those arraignments that occur at the court sessions they regularly staffed.      \n \nGiven the above pre-existing arraignment programs, ILS’ 2015 Counsel at Arraignment Plan \nidentified two gaps in arraignment coverage: weekday coverage for the East End justice courts \nthat SCLAS was not covering; and weekend and holiday coverage for all East End justice courts \nthat handle criminal cases. Each is discussed below. \n \n1)  Weekday arraignments  \n \nThe 2015 Counsel at Arraignment Plan sought to fill this gap in arraignment coverage by \nfunding the SCLAS to hire two full-time attorneys to create the capacity to cover all weekday \narraignments in East End courts, including arraignments in Quogue, West Hampton Beach, \nSouthampton Village, Sag Harbor, and Shelter Island courts. The cost to do so, including \nsalaries, fringe, other than personnel costs and mileage reimbursement, was estimated to be \n$173,808.  \n \n                                                           \n16 Data received from the ACDP reveals that these grant funded programs have resulted in arraignment coverage for \na significant number of people. For example, between November 1, 2016 and June 30, 2017, the grant program in \nD-11 resulted in 926 arraignments being covered.    \n \n48 \n \n\nAs set forth in the 2016 update report, SCLAS recruited and hired two attorneys for this \nprogram, both who began working on October 17, 2016. Because these two attorneys must be \navailable to not only cover regularly scheduled court sessions, but also on-call arraignments, \nthere are limits as to the responsibilities they can assume other than arraignment coverage, and \nthey spend the time between arraignments working on post-conviction motions and other \nassignments that allow for interruptions.  \n \nWhen the SCLAS began covering arraignments in East Hampton and Southold with the ILS \nCounsel at First Appearance grant, the SCLAS collected and maintained data on the total number \nof arraignments covered in these courts versus the total number covered because of the grant \nprogram. They have done the same with the new program funded by the Settlement. Below is the \ndata collected:  \n \nEast Hampton Town Court: From September 1, 2016 through August 31, 2017, the \nSCLAS represented a total of 167 defendants at arraignment. Of these, 52 took place on \nThursday, the day that SCLAS had traditionally staffed the court session, which means \nthat these defendants would have been represented at arraignment prior to the grant. The \nremaining 115 defendants would not have been represented at arraignment prior to the \ngrant. The percentage increase in the number of defendants represented at arraignment \nbecause of the grant is 221%. Overall, the release outcomes were good for the 115 \ndefendants represented at arraignment because of the grant, 107 (or 93%) were released \nthe same day, either because they were released on their own recognizance (77 of those \nreleased) or because bail was set at an amount they could pay that day (30 of those \nreleased).  \n \nSouthold Town Court: From September 1, 2016 through August 31, 2017, the SCLAS \nrepresented a total of 83 defendants at arraignment. Of these, 37 took place on Friday, the \nday that SCLAS had traditionally staffed the court session, which means that these \ndefendants would have been represented at arraignment prior to the grant. The remaining \n46 defendants would not have been represented at arraignment prior to the grant. The \npercentage increase in the number of defendants represented at arraignment because of \nthe grant is 124%. The release outcomes were not as good as those for East Hampton. Of \nthe 46 defendants represented at arraignment because of the grant, 28 (or 60.8%) were \nreleased the same day either because they were released on their own recognizance (19 of \nthose released) or because bail was set in an amount they could pay that day (9 of those \nwho were released).  \n \nQuogue, Southampton Village, West Hampton Beach, Sag Harbor, and Shelter Island:  \nFrom November 1, 201617 through August 31, 2017, the SCLAS covered 23 \narraignments that did not occur during the court sessions that they regularly staff – i.e., 23 \narraignments that they previously would not have covered. Of these, 65% (15) defendants \nwere released on their own recognizance; bail was set in the other 35% (8) of cases.   \n   \n                                                           \n17 Even though the two SCLAS attorneys were hired in October 2016 to cover these arraignments, because they \nneeded to be trained, they did not start to provide representation at arraignment until November 1, 2016.  \n49 \n \n\nAccording to the SCLAS data on missed arraignments, from implementation of this program \nthrough July 2017, the SCLAS missed only one East End arraignment. In that case, the SCLAS \nhad been notified prior to the arraignment that the defendant had retained private counsel; they \nappropriately determined that it would have been contrary to the rules of professional conduct to \nrepresent a defendant who had retained an attorney on the matter. See New York State Unified \nCourt System, Part 1200, Rules of Professional Conduct (January 2017).          \n \n2)  Weekend and holiday arraignments     \n \nThe 2015 Counsel at Arraignment Plan provided for the creation of an on-call program of private \nattorneys to cover weekend and holiday arraignments, which was estimated to cost $400,000. As \nset forth in the 2016 update report, on the weekend of July 9, 2016, the County began a pilot \nversion of this program to cover the largest East End courts, Riverhead Town Court and \nSouthampton Town Court; the County also included Southampton Village Court in this pilot \nprogram because of its geographic vicinity to the other two courts. The pilot program included \nfive attorneys who provided coverage on a rotational basis, with two designated as the on-call \nattorneys for Riverhead Town Court, and three designated to cover the two Southampton courts. \nThe attorneys are paid a flat fee of $32,000 per year to participate in the program.  \n \nOn the weekend of May 27, 2017, the County expanded this pilot program to include the next \ntwo busiest East End courts: East Hampton and Southold, using four additional private attorneys, \ntwo each designated to staff Southold and East Hampton Town Courts. These attorneys are also \npaid a flat rate of $32,000 per year to participate in the program.  \n \nAs set forth in the 2016 update plan, in June 2016, in collaboration with the County Attorney’s \nOffice and with input from SCLAS’ staff, ILS developed a “Model Arraignment Form.” It was \nagreed that each attorney participating in the on-call program would complete one form per \nappearance. The completed forms are then photocopied, the copies are attached to the \ncorresponding case files and are passed on to the SCLAS first thing on Monday mornings. The \noriginal arraignment forms are submitted to the County Attorney’s Office each month along with \nthe arraigning attorneys’ vouchers. The County Attorney’s Office subsequently mails the \nsubmitted arraignment forms to ILS for data processing. Currently, and on an interim basis, ILS \nhas assumed the responsibility of compiling data from the forms that are mailed to us each \nmonth. ILS has committed to this interim data maintenance and reporting obligation through \nDecember 31, 2017, after which it will be the County’s obligation. The data we have collected \nfrom the County Attorney’s office reveal that between July 9, 2016, when the pilot program \nstarted, and July 31, 2017, the program covered a total of 656 arraignments, as set forth in the \ntable below:  \n \n50 \n \n\nMonth  form,,e,:�  (O¥tttfe  Wedend, f ttolidays \nJuly 2016 - Oct 2016  \"'  7{9}16' 10{30{16  17 WHleJ>ds, 2 hoiidiY,  l.ibof D•y, Columbuo 0.y \nN�rnbe,, 2016  \"  ll/3/IHl/17/16  4 -ekends, 2 holidoys  Thanksfiwll D,y, Election D,y. \n�- No 1rr111n,,..n11 on Veteran,· O.V \nDKomber, 2016  \"  12/3/16-12/31/16  S -ekend,. l hohdoy  Chn,tmH O.V \nJanuary, 2017  \"  l/l/lH/29/11  4 weekend,, 2 hohdays  New lea(,, Mirtlft U.lhef Kin(, O.V \nFeb<uary,2017  «  2/4/17 2/26/17  4 -ekends, 2 holidoys  Uncoln'18irthd1y, Presidents' o.y \nMarch, 2017  \"  3/4/17-3/25/17  4 weekend,. no hoUdays \nAp<ij, 2017  �  4/1/17-4/30/11  S -ekend,, no holidays \nMay, 2017'  \"  S/6/17 S/29/17  4 -ekends, 1 holidoy  Mernoritl 0.y \n�- No 1rr111n,,..n11on 5unday. 5/7/17 \nJune, 2017  \"  6/3/1H,/2S/17  4 weekend,. no hoUdays \n·� \nJuly,2017  %  7/l/17-7/W17  S -ekend,. 1 holoday  lndeper.dence O.V \nTOTAL  • of Months 12  S6 weekends, II holidays \n \nOf these 656 arraignments, 56 resulted from the May 2017 expansion of the weekend on-call \nprogram to include Southold and East Hampton courts. Of these 56 arraignments, 11 occurred in \nMay 2017; 19 in June 2017; and 26 in July 2017.     \n \nTo date, the County has not developed a protocol for tracking missed arraignments, so we do not \nknow if there are missed arraignments and, if so, how many and the reason the arraignments \nwere missed.  \n \nIn early May 2017, Suffolk County Attorney Dennis Brown informed ILS of its plan to operate \nthe private attorney on-call program through December 2017, and then transition the program to \nthe SCLAS in January 2018. This decision was prompted by Mr. Brown’s concern that there \nwould not be enough private attorney interest to expand the program to the smaller, harder-to-\nreach East End courts, by the fact that there was no administration over the program, and by his \ndesire to promote vertical representation. After that meeting, the SCLAS submitted a written \nplan for covering all East End weekend and holiday arraignments. However, in early September \n2017, Mr. Brown met with Dave Besso and Daniel Russo of the ACDP, and William Ferris of \nthe Suffolk County Bar Association, regarding the program. They urged Mr. Brown to keep the \nprogram with the private bar, committing themselves to recruiting attorneys and promising that \nthe ACDP would administer the program.  \n \nOn September 29, 2017, the ACDP submitted a written proposal for an on-call program that \nwould: i) maintain the program currently running; ii) expand the program to the four remaining \nEast End courts; and iii) have the ACDP administer the program. ILS made some \nrecommendations regarding this proposed plan, and on October 12, 2017, the ACDP submitted a \nrevised proposal incorporating these recommendations. The ACDP will continue to use the nine \nattorneys who are already involved in the weekend arraignment program and has recruited three \nmore attorneys to assist in covering the remaining courts, for a total of 12 attorneys. Two of \n51 \n \n\nthese attorneys will cover Riverhead Town Court on a rotational basis; three will cover the two \nSouthampton courts on a rotational basis; two will cover Southold Town Court on a rotational \nbasis; two will cover the East Hampton and Sag Harbor courts on a rotational basis;18 two will \ncover Quogue and West Hampton courts on a rotational basis;19 and one will cover Shelter \nIsland.20 The attorneys will be paid a flat rate of between $25,000 to $37,500 per year, depending \non how busy their respective courts are. The projected budget for this program is $400,000, \nwhich equals the funding made available from the 2015 Counsel at Arraignment Plan for this on-\ncall program. The County has accepted this proposal with ILS’ endorsement. ILS will work with \nthe County and the ACDP on monitoring this program as the ACDP assumes the responsibility \nfor administering it, collecting and reporting on data, and expanding the program to the smaller \ncourts currently not covered.           \n \nIt is anticipated that by January 1, 2018, the County will have structures in place to cover \nweekend arraignments in the smaller, less busy East End courts currently not covered. Thus, by \nsharing responsibility, the SCLAS and ACDP will have implemented programs for full \narraignment coverage in Suffolk County courts.        \n \n \n        \n  \n \n            \n   \n                                                           \n18 A single judge conducts arraignments for both courts, so these arraignments will be staggered to allow the on-call \nattorney to cover all arraignments in both courts. \n   \n19 These courts are in close geographic vicinity, and the judges have agreed to stagger arraignments so that one \nattorney can cover all arraignments in both courts.  \n \n20 This attorney lives on Shelter Island and has often been asked by the judge to provide representation at \narraignment on a pro bono basis. Mr. Russo, the ACDP Administrator, will provide back-up arraignment coverage \nfour weekends per year and in case of emergencies.    \n52 \n \n\nV.  WASHINGTON COUNTY \nIn 2015, prior to Settlement implementation, Washington County had a Public Defender Office \nstaffed by a full-time Public Defender, Michael Mercure, and seven part-time assistant public \ndefenders who worked from their own offices, and one administrative support person. There was \nno office culture to speak of and calls to the Office often went unanswered. When there was a \nconflict, the Public Defender’s administrative assistant would assign an attorney from a list of \nprivate attorneys that she maintained. There was no oversight of the work of these assigned \nattorneys or their qualifications to handle the cases to which they were assigned. Given this \nminimal infrastructure, it is no surprise that in 2015, the County did not have any formal counsel \nat arraignment programs and most defendants were unrepresented at their first court appearance.   \n \nIn less than two years, because of Settlement funding and committed County officials and \nproviders, this situation has significantly changed. The Public Defender Office now has six full-\ntime attorneys (including the Public Defender), two part-time attorneys, and three administrative \nsupport staff. There is a sense of culture, professionalism, and mission. The County also has a \nformal Assigned Counsel Program with two full time administrative staff and a part-time \nSupervising Attorney who oversees the qualifications and work of assigned counsel panel \nattorneys and who has successfully recruited new attorneys to the program. Additionally, and \nperhaps most importantly, virtually all defendants in the County are now represented at their first \ncourt appearance.    \n \nThis transformation, and the County’s ongoing commitment and work toward improving the \nquality of representation, is described in more detail below.               \n \nA.  Quality \n \nWashington County was allocated $92,624 of the Settlement’s Quality funding. This money, in \nconjunction with ILS non-competitive distributions and Caseload Relief funding, has been used \nto transform the Public Defender Office from a fractured group of part-time attorneys to a \nprofessional office with full-time attorneys and non-attorney staff. The funding has also been \nused to create the infrastructure for an Assigned Counsel Program overseen by a Supervising \nAttorney, Thomas Cioffi, who is committed to quality representation.   \n \n1.  Public Defender Office \nThe Public Defender Office received $48,124 of the Settlement’s Quality funding, which it used \nto hire a full-time Administrative Assistant to manage the Office’s administrative functions and \nbetter support the staff attorneys. This Administrative Assistant, Lisa Ringer, started her position \nin a part-time capacity on February 25, 2016 and was promoted to full time on April 18, 2016.  \nMr. Mercure reports that her work has been invaluable and that she has grown into a role as \noffice manager for non-attorney staff. Additionally, Ms. Ringer is tracking all the data for the \nOffice’s counsel at arraignment programs, which frees up Mr. Mercure for other matters. Ms. \nRinger’s tracking of the information about the Office’s on-call counsel at arraignment program \nhas been critical in preparing for the County’s centralized arraignment program (discussed \nfurther below). She also provides administrative support to two attorneys, closes some family \ncourt cases, and manages the office’s calendar. Given the growth in Ms. Ringer’s duties, it has \n53 \n \n\nbecome apparent that another administrative assistant is needed. It is anticipated that this position \nwill be funded through Caseload Relief II funding  \n \nTo its credit, the County has not confined its quality improvement initiatives to the hiring of Ms. \nRinger. Rather, the County has effectively used ILS distribution funding and Settlement Counsel \nat Arraignment and Caseload Relief funding to transition most of the Office’s part-time staff \nattorney positions to full-time. In September 2015, using ILS distribution money, the Public \nDefender Office transitioned three of its part-time attorneys to full-time. In 2016, using Counsel \nat Arraignment funding, a fourth part-time staff attorney position was transitioned to a full-time \npositon, and in January 2017, using Caseload Relief funding, a fifth part-time position was \ntransitioned to full-time. The structured attorney interviews that ILS conducted over this past \nsummer reveal that the transition of a Public Defender Office that was composed primarily of \npart-time attorneys to full-time attorneys has had a meaningful impact on attorney morale, \nsupport, and supervision. Because the full-time attorneys work out of one office instead of \nprivate offices scattered across the County, they regularly brainstorm their cases and consult with \neach other. Mr. Mercure has designated his most experienced attorney, Barry Jones, as his First \nAssistant, and staff attorneys feel that there is always someone available – either Mr. Mercure or \nMr. Jones – to whom they can go for a case-related issue or question. Because of his \ncomprehensive legal knowledge, the staff attorneys refer to Mr. Jones as the “almanac.”  \n \nWorking with ILS and the New York State Defenders Association (NYSDA), and using Counsel \nat Arraignment and Caseload Relief funding, the Public Defender Office and the Assigned \nCounsel Program have co-sponsored a series of Continuing Legal Education programs held in \nWashington County. On November 18, 2016, ILS met with NYSDA, Barry Jones, and Tom \nCioffi, the Assigned Counsel Supervising Attorney. We discussed future training in Washington \nCounty and possible formats and schedules. NYSDA distributed an extensive survey to the \nassistant public defenders and assigned counsel attorneys about their training priorities. The \nsurvey was used to help develop the following CLEs:   \n   \nDecember 14, 2016  How to Get the Most from First Appearance:  \nThe Ins and Outs of Arraignments \n \nFebruary 15, 2017  Immigration Issues for Criminal Defense Attorneys \n \nMarch 29, 2017  Challenging Accusatory Instruments \n \nApril 18, 2017  Intersection of Family Court and Immigration for Criminal \nAttorneys  \n \n  May 5, 2017    Challenging Fines and Fees \n \n  October 4, 2017  Pros of Investigating Your Case \n \n \n \n54 \n \n\n \nPaul Chambers, Ontario Co. Public Defender Office \nSenior Investigator, presenting at the October 4 CLE \n \nOctober 4 CLE participants from Public Defender Office and ACP \n \nIn addition to training, Caseload Relief funding has been used to create a budget for the Public \nDefender Office to access non-attorney professional supports. Previously, the Public Defender \nOffice had no dedicated funding for non-attorney professionals, and had to apply to the judge or \nmagistrate. The Public Defender Office now maintains a fund to retain experts, investigators and \nany other needed non-attorney professional supports. During our structured interviews, attorneys \nreported that expert and investigation services are being used more often. Attorneys noted that it \nis much easier to use investigators since the office now has an investigator on contract, and \n55 \n \n\nattorneys do not have to apply to the court for investigation use. In one case the investigator \nobtained exculpatory evidence early in the case which led to the dismissal of charges against a \nwrongly accused client. The gains that have been made by the Public Defender’s office can be \nillustrated by the following: in 2015, the amount spent on investigations was nominal; in 2016, \nthe Office spent $6,910.74 on investigations; and so far in 2017, the Office has spent $14,750 on \ninvestigations. Regarding experts, in 2017 the Office used the following experts in cases: a blood \nsplatter expert and forensics expert in a homicide case; a handwriting expert in a welfare fraud \ncase; and a psychological expert in a sex offense case.  \n \nWith its growing number of full-time staff attorneys and administrative staff, space reached a \ncrisis point for the Public Defender Office by early 2017. Attorneys were doubled up in tiny \noffices, and there was no conference space for client or office meetings. The Public Defender \nOffice is housed in the County Court complex, which is a convenient location. But because there \nare other County agencies competing for space in this complex, there currently is not any \nappropriate County space to which the Office can re-locate. Finally, in August 2017, the County \nimplemented a short-term solution and provided the Public Defender Office with additional \nspace across the hall from their current office. Though Mr. Mercure states that this additional \nspace is a significant improvement for the Office, no one views it as a long-term solution.        \n \nThe Public Defender Office still has work to do to improve the quality of services it provides its \nclients, including developing a long-term solution to the Office’s space problem. But as Mr. \nMercure recently told ILS, with resources and a short-term solution to the space problem, the \nOffice is now poised to begin re-examining current practices and thinking in terms of a new \nmanner of defense: one that emphasizes oral and written advocacy, creative litigation, case \ninvestigation, and the effective use of non-attorney professionals. \n   \n2.  Assigned Counsel Program \n \nThe 2015 Quality Plan provided $44,500 in funding for Washington County to professionalize its \nAssigned Counsel Program. Of this money, $27,500, in conjunction with additional County \nfunding, was used to hire an administrative assistant, Patricia Connors. The rest of the ACP’s \nQuality funding, $17,000, was supplemented by Caseload Relief funding to hire a part-time \nsupervising attorney to support ACP panel attorneys. Thomas Cioffi was hired for the position \nand began his role as ACP Supervising Attorney on August 22, 2016.   \n \nMr. Cioffi immediately began working to confront many of the issues facing the ACP. First, Mr. \nCioffi took control of attorney assignments to ensure that the assigned attorneys have the \nqualifications necessary to handle the types of cases assigned to them. Mr. Cioffi has also started \nto recruit new members to the panel who have more experience in criminal defense and can \nhandle more serious felony offenses. He also began to oversee the implementation of the ILS \nCriteria and Procedures for Determining Assigned Counsel Eligibility to ensure that defendants \nwho cannot afford an attorney are promptly provided with one. Mr. Cioffi also installed a \ncomputer terminal in the ACP office which provides Westlaw legal research access for panel \nattorneys. During ILS’ structured interviews, panel attorneys reported that the addition of the \nWestlaw computer terminal was a much-needed support. Mr. Cioffi notifies and encourages \nattorneys to attend the in-house CLEs described above. Again, in structured interviews, panel \n56 \n \n\nattorneys reported that they found this support helpful. Additionally, attorneys reported that they \nliked being able to brainstorm with each other before and after the CLEs.   \n \nFinally, Mr. Cioffi met with ILS on several occasions to draft an Assigned Counsel Plan and \nHandbook. The Assigned Counsel Plan is a document that sets forth the structure of the program.  \nThe Handbook is a more detailed document for the panel attorneys that outlines the criteria for \npanel participation, resources and supports available to attorneys, and attorney responsibilities. \nThe Plan and Handbook are being reviewed by the Washington County Bar Association with the \nhope that they will be approved shortly. \n \nArmed with this Handbook and clear processes and protocols for panel attorneys, Mr. Cioffi is \nwell positioned to work more diligently with panel attorneys on ensuring high quality \nrepresentation. Mr. Cioffi has already demonstrated his capacity to reform policies and practices. \nAs detailed in ILS’ April 2017 report about implementation of the ILS Criteria and Procedures \nfor Determining Assigned Counsel Eligibility, in a matter of months, Mr. Cioffi transformed the \nACP’s policies and procedures for determining assigned counsel eligibility to ensure that the \napplication process is accessible to everyone and that there are no needless barriers to applying \nfor assigned counsel.    \n   \nB.  Counsel at Arraignment \n \nIn 2015, Washington County had no formal counsel at arraignment programs; it was the only \nHurrell-Harring county that had not applied for ILS’ competitive Counsel at First Appearance \ngrant. But under Mr. Mercure’s leadership and with Settlement funding, the County is now \nrepresenting nearly every defendant at arraignment, with only incidental and sporadic missed \narraignments. Additionally, Washington County has joined Onondaga County as one of the four \ncounties across the State to take advantage of the recently enacted legislation to implement a \ncentralized arraignment program. \n \n1.  Washington County’s Counsel at Arraignment Programs \nThe Washington County Public Defender Office has implemented the following programs to \nensure that all arraignments are covered: \n \n-  Regularly scheduled DA sessions: As previously stated, in September 2015, the \nPublic Defender Office used ILS distribution funding to transition three of its part-\ntime assistant public defenders to full-time. This has allowed the Office to staff all \njustice courts’ regularly scheduled DA sessions and to represent anyone being \narraigned during these sessions. \n \n-  Regularly scheduled non-DA court sessions: With support from Anthony Jordan, the \nWashington County District Attorney, all county law enforcement agencies have \nagreed to issue appearance tickets for DA court sessions only. ILS worked with the \nState to obtain similar agreements from state law enforcement agencies. As described \nin ILS’ 2016 update report, these agreements were in place by early 2016. Thus, \narraignments seldom occur during these court sessions. When they do, the justices \n57 \n \n\ncontact the Public Defender Office’s on-call attorney (discussed below) to represent \nthe defendant. \n \n-  Off-hour arraignments that occur during business hours: The 2015 Counsel at \nArraignment Plan provides funding for the Public Defender Office to transition an \nadditional part-time assistant public defender to full-time to bolster the Office’s \ncapacity to cover these arraignments. As detailed in ILS’s 2016 update report, this \ntransition occurred late in August 2016. But even prior to this change, in May 2016, \nthe Public Defender Office implemented this program by informing magistrates of it \nand asking them to notify the Public Defender Office of all such off-hour \narraignments. Though the Public Defender Office started the program with \ninsufficient staffing, the Office was committed to covering these arraignments and did \nso, even though it meant that between May and August 2016, Office staff attorneys \nwere stretched quite thin. \n \n-  Non-business hour (night, weekend, and holiday) off-hour arraignments: The 2015 \nCounsel at Arraignment Plan funded a program of rotating on-call attorneys to cover \nthese arraignments. Under this program, there were two attorneys on-call, a primary \nattorney and a back-up attorney. The program was staffed primarily by Public \nDefender Office attorneys, though there was funding available to allow private \nattorneys to rotate into the program. As detailed in the 2016 update report, the \nprogram started in May 2016 as a pilot program, consisting of just the primary on-call \nattorney. Throughout 2016, Mr. Mercure ran the program with just the primary on-\ncall attorney; there was no paid back-up attorney. Still, Mr. Mercure ensured that he \nwas notified whenever there was a need for a back-up attorney, and in most instances, \nhe would fill this need. In January 2017, Mr. Mercure implemented the paid back-up \ncomponent of the program. To date, the Public Defender Office has fully staffed the \nprogram, and has not included private attorneys in the on-call rotation.  \n \nA critical aspect of the two on-call programs has been notification of the Public Defender Office \nof off-hour arraignments. For various reasons, the County dispatch cannot provide notification. \nThus, it was critical to obtain buy-in from local magistrates to ensure that they notify the Public \nDefender Office of all off-hour arraignments. Mr. Mercure worked strategically to obtain this \nbuy-in by sending magistrates written information about the off-hour programs, regularly \nattending county magistrates’ meetings, and engaging in informal conversation with magistrates \nabout the program. These efforts have worked, and magistrates are regularly and consistently \nnotifying the Public Defender Office of off-hour arraignments. The Public Defender Office also \noften receives cross-notification from the District Attorney’s Office.   \n \nILS received data from the Public Defender Office and the ACP regarding the number of \narraignments covered from November 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017. According to this data, the \nPublic Defender Office arraignment program covered a total of 1,426 arraignments.21    \n                                                           \n21 Seven of these 1,426 arraignments were cases in which the Public Defender Office identified a conflict prior to \narraignment and arranged for an ACP attorney to represent the defendant at arraignment. Two of these 1,426 \narraignments were cases in which a private attorney represented defendants at arraignment on behalf of the Public \nDefender Office. Mr. Mercure had arranged for this attorney to assist with arraignment coverage during a brief \n58 \n \n\n \nTo assess how well its counsel at arraignment programs are working, the Public Defender Office \nworked with ILS to implement strategies for tracking missed arraignments. These strategies \ninclude tracking all magistrate calls about off-hour arraignments; checking jail logs daily to \ndetermine if there has been any person admitted to the jail who had not been represented at \narraignment; and including a question about whether the applicant had been represented at \narraignment on the application for assignment of counsel. According to the data the Public \nDefender Office reported to ILS about missed arraignments, during the period October 1, 2016 \nthrough June 30, 2017, the Office missed only 14 arraignments, two of which occurred in a \nsingle day and were covered by a private attorney who was present and represented the \ndefendant at the justice’s request. Six of the remaining missed arraignments occurred because of \none justice who failed to notify the Public Defender Office’s on-call attorney of the arraignment. \nMr. Mercure has reminded this justice of the need to notify the Public Defender Office’s on-call \nattorney of all off-hour arraignments. The remaining missed arraignments occurred for various \nother reasons, including, for example, an attorney’s illness or the justice not waiting for the on-\ncall attorney to arrive. Notably, there have been fewer missed arraignments with each quarter: in \nthe last quarter of 2016, the Public Defender Office missed seven arraignments; in the first \nquarter of 2017, the Office missed five arraignments, and in the second quarter of 2017, the \nOffice missed only two arraignments.   \n \nThough the Public Defender Office has done an extraordinary job in covering virtually all \narraignments, the Office’s off-hour program has taxed its staff attorneys. During ILS’ structured \ninterviews with staff attorneys, they described the challenges of the on-call program. One \nattorney, for example, reported that over the course of one weekend, she drove over 500 miles to \nappear at off-hour arraignments. Mr. Mercure recently told ILS that he is worried about the \nextraordinary amount of driving the on-call program requires, and opined that “it’s a miracle that \nno one has been hit by a deer,” which is not a remote possibility in rural Washington County.  \n \n2.  Washington County’s Centralized Arraignment Plan    \nFortunately, on September 2017, pursuant to newly enacted Judiciary Law § 212(1)(w), Chief \nAdministrative Judge Lawrence Marks authorized Washington County to implement a \ncentralized arraignment program with a Centralized Arraignment Part (CAP). Under this \nprogram, there are two arraignment sessions each day for all off-hour arraignments in the \nCounty: a morning arraignment session that runs from 7:00 a.m. to 9:30 a.m.; and an evening \nsession that runs from 7:00 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. Both sessions run every day, 365 days per year, and \nboth have the jurisdiction to arraign any person arrested in the County. The arraignment part will \nbe in the outer foyer of the jail to minimize law enforcement transport costs. These arraignments \nwill be open to the public. Local magistrates will preside over these arraignments in accordance \nwith a rotational schedule.   \n \nThe Public Defender Office worked with ILS on developing a plan to staff this centralized \narraignment program. Under this plan, the Public Defender Office will schedule one attorney for \neach arraignment session. At least initially, the Public Defender Office will also maintain the on-\n                                                           \nperiod when his office was involved in a high-profile second degree murder re-trial. The Public Defender Office \nstaff covered the remaining 1,417 arraignments.     \n59 \n \n\ncall program staffed with just one attorney to cover any off-hour arraignments that may occur \ndespite the centralized arraignment parts. ILS will work with the Public Defender Office to \nmonitor the on-call program to gauge the number and frequency of any off-hour arraignments \nand to assess if the program needs to continue.  \n \nThe costs to fund the Public Defender Office to staff the centralized arraignment parts, continue \nthe on-call program, and continue to pay for the transition of one part-time attorney to full-time \nfalls within the $264,612 in funding set forth in the 2015 Counsel at Arraignment Plan and \nallocated by the State for full arraignment coverage in Washington County.   \n \nWashington County’s Centralized Arraignment Program commenced on October 20, 2017. Mr. \nMercure prepared by scheduling staff attorneys for the centralized arraignment parts and \nupdating his Office’s arraignment forms. He has also been diligent in attending meetings with \nOCA, County officials, State and local law enforcement, and magistrates to ensure that everyone \nis aware of the plan’s details. ILS looks forward to working with the County and the Public \nDefender Office on monitoring this program.    \n60 \n \n\nCOUNSEL AT ARRAIGNMENT: BENEFITS, INITATIVES, AND NEXT STEPS TO \nELEVATING ARRAIGNMENT ADVOCACY \n \nAs described in this report, the Hurrell-Harring providers have worked hard to implement \ncounsel at arraignment programs to ensure that all defendants are represented by counsel the first \ntime they appear in criminal court. The providers have erected structures and systems to provide \nattorneys at arraignments during regularly scheduled court sessions and all manner of off-hours: \noff-hour business hours, evenings, holidays and weekends. They have asked more of existing \nstaff, created on-call programs, managed complicated schedules, and hired and trained new staff. \nThey have reached out to other stakeholders, including county officials, local prosecutors, law \nenforcement, and the judiciary to cultivate a culture where counsel at arraignment is the new \nnormal.     \n \nSince the Hurrell-Harring counties have begun implementing counsel at arraignment programs, \nthey have consistently made it clear to ILS that they are engaging in these efforts not just \nbecause the Settlement requires it, but because they know from experience that having counsel at \ndefendants’ first court appearance makes a difference. In this regard, they have told us how they \nhave used their counsel at arraignment programs as avenues for the prompt assignment of \ncounsel and quality improvement initiatives.  \n \nThese efforts notwithstanding, there is growing recognition across the State that defense counsel \ncan elevate the level of advocacy at arraignments to ensure that fewer people are detained pre-\ntrial and to guard against unjust prosecutions.    \n \nBelow we discuss some benefits to having counsel at arraignment, some initiatives to enhance \nthe quality of representation and facilitate prompt assignment of counsel, and next steps to \nelevating the level of arraignment advocacy.      \n  \nA.  How Having Counsel at Arraignment Can Enhance the Quality of Representation \nand Facilitate Prompt Assignment of Counsel   \n \nThere are some improvements to the quality of representation that inevitably flow from having \ncounsel at arraignment. One that providers frequently mention is protecting their clients’ rights \nagainst self-incrimination. It is natural for people who have been arrested to want to tell their \nstory at their first court appearance, whether it is to proclaim their innocence or justify their \nactions. But doing so can implicate their rights against self-incrimination and jeopardize possible \ndefenses in their case. Arraigning attorneys stand between their clients and the power of the \nstate, counseling their clients on what to say and the value of using a more appropriate forum to \ntell their story, such as an oral or written motion made by counsel in which the story is legally \nrelevant. The presence of counsel at arraignment serves to protect clients’ rights against \ninadvertent and uncounseled self-incrimination, particularly for clients who are less sophisticated \nand more vulnerable because of their age, disability, or physical or emotional condition at \narraignment. \n \nProviders also remind ILS that having counsel at arraignment is a significant step to cultivating \nthe client’s trust in the system and in their assigned attorney. Clients are often upset or confused \n61 \n \n\nat arraignment and understandably limited in what, if anything, they understand about criminal \ncase proceedings. Arraigning attorneys explain the legal process to their clients and often their \nfamily members or loved ones. And the arraigning attorney advocates for the client, whether it is \nregarding release status, the issuance of an order of protection, the loss of a license, or simply \ninsisting that the client be treated with dignity by the court system. The reassuring presence of \ncounsel coupled with advocacy at arraignment is key to developing strong client relations that \nendure throughout the life of the case. It also objectively demonstrates that the criminal justice \nsystem has procedures in place for the fair treatment of accused persons.  \n \nAttorneys throughout the five counties report that counsel’s presence at arraignment also makes \na difference in a client’s release status. Attorneys frequently comment that their presence serves \nas a check on overreaching by the prosecution and the judge, and they have identified many \ninstances in which they persuaded a court to release their client or to set a more reasonable bail.  \nSome examples include the following:  \n \nA teacher from Pennsylvania was arrested and arraigned on a Sunday. The arraigning \nattorney successfully advocated for a reasonable bail to be set, even though the client was \nfrom out of state. The attorney also contacted the client’s family members, and they were \nable to post the bail. The client was released on Monday and able to return to work.   \n    – Schuyler County Public Defender Office    \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \nThe client was charged with several misdemeanors. During the initial interview, the client \nraised serious issues related to the arrest and the conduct of the police. The arraigning \nattorney immediately obtained and reviewed the dash-cam footage of the incident, which \ncorroborated the client’s version of events. The judge was persuaded to release the client \nbased largely on this evidence. Guided by the client’s version of events and the dash-cam \nfootage, an immediate investigation was commenced by the attorney and the case was \ndismissed in relatively short order.         \n    – Suffolk County Legal Aid Society           \n                                               \nThe defendant was charged with criminal contempt in the first degree, a felony. Prior to \narraignment, the attorney interviewed the client and learned that the complainant had \nentered the defendant’s house after the alleged incident giving rise to the charges. The \nprosecutor was arguing for a significant bail amount, but the arraigning attorney \nsuccessfully used the information about the complainant to argue for a much lower bail – \none that the client could post.  \n  – Onondaga County on-call arraignment attorney \n \nA client with two prior felony convictions was arraigned in local court. Under the law, \nthe prior felony convictions meant that the justice court could not set bail. But armed with \ninformation learned during the interview with the client, the attorney subsequently made \na bail application to the County Court. The County Court lowered the bail to an amount \nthe client could post, and the client was released.                  \n    – Schuyler County Public Defender Office  \n \n \n62 \n \n\nIn addition to the foregoing, providers have also taken advantage of the presence of counsel at \narraignment to implement initiatives designed to improve quality and facilitate access to assigned \ncounsel.  \n  \n1.  Holistic Representation \n \nIn Suffolk County, the SCLAS has implemented an arraignment initiative that fosters holistic \nrepresentation by identifying and addressing clients’ psycho-social needs. As described \npreviously, Settlement funding has allowed the SCLAS to bolster its social worker unit. At \narraignment, clients’ non-legal needs such as housing, substance abuse treatment, income \nsupport, or veterans’ benefits are identified on an intake form. This form is given to a SCLAS \nsocial worker who assists the client in accessing the services needed. Serving clients holistically \nin this manner can have a direct impact on the criminal case by addressing issues, such as a \nsubstance abuse or mental health problem, that contributed to involvement in the criminal justice \nsystem. Even when this service does not directly impact the criminal case, it promotes better \nclient engagement in the defense and enhanced trust in the defense team. It can also result in \nclients being better equipped to avoid arrest while the criminal case is pending and after it is \nresolved. The following illustrates how this service enhances advocacy:    \nThe SCLAS client was charged with felony larceny. The client was addicted to opioids, and the \njudge was determined to keep the client in custody so that he would detox in jail. The client’s \nfamily was present in court, but unable to post this substantial cash bail. The SCLAS attorney \ninvolved one of the SCLAS social workers, who met with the client to formulate a short-term plan \nto address the client’s addiction. Armed with this plan, the SCLAS attorney persuaded the justice \nto set a bond alternative to the cash bail, which the client’s family could secure. Upon the client’s \nrelease on bond, he was referred to a 28-day in-patient treatment program. To date, the client \nremains substance free and is continuing treatment.  \n \n \nTo further promote holistic representation, SCLAS also uses arraignment as an opportunity to \nascertain clients’ immigration status. If a client is not a United States citizen, the attorney \nimmediately reaches out to SCLAS’ immigration unit for advice and consultation, as illuminated \nbelow:    \n63 \n \n\n \nThe SCLAS client was arraigned on two felony sex offense charges. Because the client was not a U.S. \ncitizen, the charges gave rise to potentially significant immigration consequences. The SCLAS attorney \nconsulted with the SCLAS in-house immigration unit to determine the best approach short-term \n(custody status) and long term (case outcome). The SCLAS attorney also involved the SCLAS \ninvestigator unit to start an investigation and develop and corroborate mitigating factors the client \nraised during the interview. Additionally, the SCLAS attorney immediately reached out to the assigned \nprosecutor to initiate plea negotiations pre-indictment. The attorney successfully forestalled any \nindictment, negotiated a reduction of the charges, and worked towards an ultimate disposition of the \ncase that minimized the adverse immigration impact upon the client. \n  \nThe SCLAS’ holistic approach serves as a model for other defender offices. \n \n2.  Facilitating Prompt Assignment of Counsel \n \nSome of the Hurrell-Harring providers have also used the presence of defense counsel at \narraignment to facilitate prompt assignment of counsel for individuals who cannot afford to \nretain counsel. For example, in Schuyler County, the arraigning attorneys always carry \napplications for assignment of counsel with them. Time permitting, they sit with clients at \narraignment to help them complete the application and take it back to the office; if there is not \nenough time, they tell the client how to complete and submit the application. The Washington \nCounty Public Defender Office staff attorneys follow a similar model. Additionally, Washington \nCounty Public Defender Office attorneys often encourage magistrates to assign counsel \nimmediately at arraignment when it is evident that a defendant cannot afford to retain counsel, \nsuch as when the defendant is homeless, unemployed, or in school.   \n \nSimilarly, the Onondaga County Assigned Counsel Program has stationed a staff person outside \nthe arraignment part in Syracuse City Court. This staff person assists defendants who appear on \nappearance tickets with completing the assigned counsel application. Detained defendants also \nreceive help with the assigned counsel application from the arraignment attorneys during their \npre-arraignment interviews. While not all defendants’ applications are completed at arraignment, \nthe presence of counsel and staff at arraignment has sped up the eligibility determination process \nconsiderably for many ACP clients.    \n \nB.  Suggestions for Elevating the Level of Arraignment Practice: Pre-Trial Release \nAdvocacy and Motions to Dismiss \n \nOver the first two years of the Settlement, ILS’ work has been focused on helping providers \ndevelop systems and procedures to have attorneys present in court to represent all defendants at \ntheir first court appearances. As this report documents, that objective has been met in each of the \nfive Hurrell-Harring counties, and missed arraignments are sporadic and incidental.    \n \n64 \n \n\nILS will continue to i) monitor the current counsel at arraignment programs; ii) provide \nassistance when needed to refine these programs; and iii) work with counties on implementation \nof centralized arraignment programs pursuant to Judiciary Law § 212(1)(w).    \n \nILS recognizes that because the counsel at arraignment programs are in place, we can now start \nworking with providers to enhance the quality of representation at arraignment. There are two \nareas that are ripe for enhanced advocacy: pre-trial release alternatives and motions to dismiss. \n \n1.  Pre-Trial Release Alternatives: More Effective Advocacy Under New York’s Bail Statute \n \nOne critical area is defendants’ release status. Providers typically argue for clients to be released \non their own recognizance or under supervision or, if they lose this argument, for a bail amount \nthe defendant can pay. But all too often judges set bail amounts that are excessive in relation to \nthe need to secure the defendant’s presence in court. This results in too many defendants being \nneedlessly detained while their charges are pending. As defense attorneys know from experience, \npre-trial incarceration dramatically affects case results. Social science research is in accord, as \nmultiple studies show significantly better case outcomes for defendants who are not incarcerated \nduring the pendency of their case.22    \n \nTypically, attorneys ask for and judges rely on only two forms of bail: cash bail or insurance \ncompany bail bond. But even relatively low cash bail amounts can be out of reach for \ndefendants, and many defendants lack the resources to pay any amount of cash bail upfront. Nor \ncan low-income defendants meet the requirements for insurance company bonds, which require \npayment of a 10% premium and often other conditions, such as other payers who can provide \nproof of employment and are willing to be liable for the bond amount.  \n \nAlthough judges and attorneys rely primarily on cash bail or bond, New York’s bail statute, \nCriminal Procedure Law (CPL) § 520.10, authorizes nine different forms of bail. The two \nalternatives that hold the most promise for low-\nincome or indigent defendants are partially \nsecured and unsecured bonds.

Partially secured surety bond   \n6. Partially secured appearance bond  These forms of bail are rarely sought or \n7. Unsecured surety bond  utilized, likely because defense attorneys and \n8. Unsecured appearance bond  judges tend to be unfamiliar with them. Yet \n9. Credit card or similar device  there is growing awareness among defense \nattorneys as to these alternative forms of bail.  \nFor example, in September 2017, the Vera \n                                                           \n22 See ILS 2016 Update, Implementing the Counsel at Arraignment Obligations in the Hurrell-Harring v. The State \nof New York Settlement, p. 42, citing research studies. \n \n65 \n \n\nInstitute of Justice issued a report describing the overall positive results that emerged from a \nthree-month project in New York City involving 99 cases in which a secured or partially secured \nbond was set. Entitled “Against the Odds: Experimenting with Alternative Forms of Bail in New \nYork City’s Criminal Courts,” the report recommended, among other things, that stakeholders be \neducated about these alternative forms of bail.23  \n \nAdditionally, the New York State Defenders Association’s annual conference in July 2017 \nincluded a continuing legal education program by Joshua Norkin, an attorney from the New \nYork City Legal Aid Society, about alternative forms of bail. Mr. Norkin argued that better \nadvocacy can reduce the number of people detained pretrial, particularly if this advocacy \nincludes arguments for use of the alternative forms of bail available in New York. He noted that \nNew York’s bail statute was reformed in 1970 to authorize nine forms of bail with the express \ngoal of “reduc[ing] the un-convicted portion of our jail population.”24 During this program, Mr. \nNorkin detailed how these alternative forms of bail, particularly the unsecured surety bond and \nthe unsecured appearance bond, can work in securing the pre-trial release of clients. Attorneys \nmust educate themselves and judges about the use of these alternative forms of bail.         \n \nAs noted in the Vera report, use of these alternative forms of bail requires more work on the part \nof the court and the defense, and a shift in culture. One of the judges responsible for many of the \ncases discussed in the Vera report aptly described this:25 \n  \nWhat initially happened is that a partially secured \nbond was requested. I gave it thought and I did it. \nInitially, I met some resistance to completing the \npaperwork. It’s more work for the defense attorney \nand for the court. But any time you’re doing \nsomething new or different it takes time. Culture \nchange. You can do it but it takes time.   \nThis recent education about and advocacy around the use alternatives forms of bail provide an \nopportunity for the Hurrell-Harring providers to develop training programs for its arraigning \nattorneys to advocate more effectively for pre-trial release. ILS will work with the Hurrell-\nHarring providers to connect them with information and training opportunities so that these \nalternative forms of bail can be sought and utilized more often.      \n \n                                                           \n23 This report is available at:  https://www.vera.org/publications/against-the-odds-bail-reform-new-york-city-\ncriminal-courts.  \n \n24 Temporary Commission on Revision of the Penal Law and Criminal Code, Proposed New York Criminal \nProcedure Law (New York: West Publishing Co., 1969), Section 5, https://perma.cc/3VM5-FRLN.   \n  \n25 See Against the Odds, at 25. \n \n66 \n \n\n \n2.  Motions to Dismiss \n \nAnother important aspect of arraignment practice are motions to dismiss the charging document, \noften called the accusatory instrument. Review of the charging document is key to full \nrepresentation at arraignment. It is necessary for the attorney to know the penal law provision the \nclient is accused of violating, exactly what the client is accused of doing, including when and \nwhere, and the specific factual basis for the charges. An accusatory instrument is facially \ninsufficient if it does not contain allegations which, if true, establish every element of the \ncriminal offense charged and the defendant’s commission of that offense. Facially insufficient \naccusatory instruments are jurisdictionally defective and subject to dismissal. \n  \nMoving to dismiss in appropriate cases is key to forceful arraignment advocacy; a dismissal is \nobviously of great benefit to the client.26  \n \nIn Ontario County, the Public Defender Office is actively working to enhance the use of motions \nto dismiss at arraignment. Motivated by a training on this topic, Ontario County Public Defender \nOffice staff attorneys have started to make oral motions to dismiss at arraignment on a regular \nbasis. In some cases, the court will adjourn with the request that the motion be submitted in \nwriting, to give the prosecution time to respond, or both. The Public Defender Office is working \non a written template which attorneys can bring to court, fill in case-specific details, and submit \nat arraignment. The Public Defender, Leanne Lapp, reports that the judges do not like to dismiss \ncases at such an early stage, so success on these motions is infrequent. However, she and her \nstaff believe that pointing out weaknesses in the prosecution’s case is helpful in the advocacy for \npre-trial release or a reasonable bail and in framing up front key aspects of the defense.   \n \nThe Ontario County Public Defender Office’s arraignment initiative is a model that can be \nreplicated in other counties and an opportunity for cross-pollination of initiatives amongst the \nHurrell-Harring providers who are all seeking to enhance the quality of their advocacy.        \n \n \n   \n                                                           \n26 Dismissals may be with or without prejudice. If without prejudice, the case could, but need not be, refiled. \n67 \n \n\nONGOING BARRIERS TO QUALITY REPRESENTATION \n \nFor the 2016 update report, we identified some barriers to quality representation based on some \ninformal interviews of staff attorneys, our court observations, and our regular meetings with the \nHurrell-Harring providers. As detailed earlier in this report, this past year we once again \nsystematically observed court proceedings in the five Hurrell-Harring counties, prioritizing \nwhenever possible County Court sessions and special lower court sessions. In total, we observed \n62 different court sessions. We also developed a protocol for interviewing provider staff \nattorneys and panel attorneys which focused on supervision, training, use of non-attorney \nprofessionals, and client communication. Using this protocol, we interviewed 29 staff attorneys \nand assigned counsel panel attorneys. Finally, we conducted a very preliminary review of the \ndata that we obtained from the Case Closing Forms (CCFs) described in the 2016 update report, \nfocusing on use of non-attorney professionals.27   \n \nBased on this, we again discuss some barriers to quality representation, where appropriate \nincorporating and updating what we discussed in the 2016 update report.   \n \nA.  Compensation Rates for Assigned Counsel and Voucher Processing  \n \nAs stated in the 2016 update report, the statutory hourly rates for assigned counsel set forth in \nCounty Law § 722-b present a barrier to quality representation. The rates, which are $60 per hour \nfor misdemeanors and $75 per hour for felonies, have not been raised since 2004. County Law \n§722-b also imposes a cap on the total amount an attorney can bill for each case, capping \nmisdemeanors at $2,400 and felonies at $4,400. Attorneys who exceed these caps cannot be paid \nunless they convince the court that there are “extraordinary circumstances” requiring payment \nabove the cap.  \n \nThe process for reviewing and paying vouchers can exacerbate this problem. In some counties, \nfor example, assigned counsel programs have sought to save money by severely limiting the \nservices for which attorneys can bill, not allowing attorneys to bill for certain necessary \nadministrative functions, such as copying and mail costs, or completing time sheets and other \nrequired documentation. Some assigned counsel programs also limit substantive services for \nwhich attorneys can bill, such as travel time and mileage, reviewing case files, making telephone \ncalls, etc. Additionally, in some counties there is a delay in processing vouchers, resulting in a \nsignificant delay from the attorney’s submission of the voucher to its payment. During the June \n2017 ACP Summit (discussed below), experienced ACP leaders identified prompt voucher \npayment as perhaps the most significant advantage over retained cases that an assigned counsel \nprogram can offer panel attorneys. Thus, delay in paying vouchers is a disincentive for quality \nattorneys to remain on the panel.      \n \n                                                           \n27 Because of unanticipated complications in updating provider case management systems so that the data from the \nCCFs could be extracted and reported to ILS, we are still in the process of reviewing the CCF reports the providers \nhave given us, identifying and pulling out “bad data,” and resolving issues of missing data. Once this is done, we \nwill be in a better position to review the data we have received in the context of what we have learned from attorney \ninterviews and court observations.    \n68 \n \n\nThere is no question the hourly rates and case caps set forth in County Law § 722-b should be re-\nexamined and raised. In the meantime, however, ILS is working with the Hurrell-Harring \nassigned counsel programs to eliminate the voucher processing disincentives to participation on \nthe assigned counsel programs. Ideas for eliminating these disincentives were discussed during \nthe June 2017 ACP Summit, and we have already seen Hurrell-Harring ACPs take steps to \naddress them. For example, as previously described, the Onondaga ACP has significantly \ntransformed its voucher review process by: i) abandoning the practice of cutting vouchers for \nsubstantive services; ii) abandoning the practice of requiring attorneys to explain why they spent \nmore than a certain amount of time on services (for example, why they spent more than 0.9 hours \non client communication); iii) notifying attorneys of substantive services they can voucher for, \nsuch as assistance in working with DMV in license-related offenses; and iv) significantly \ndecreasing the delay in processing vouchers so that attorneys are paid promptly after submitting \ntheir vouchers. Similarly, the Suffolk County ACDP is working diligently to decrease the delay \nin processing vouchers so that attorneys are paid in a reasonable amount of time. The Suffolk \nACDP is also encouraging other stakeholders involved in the voucher review process, including \nCounty officials and judges, to prioritize this issue.     \n \nB.  Compensation for Non-Attorney Professionals  \n \nAn additional and pressing barrier to quality representation is inadequate compensation rates for \nnon-attorney professionals. Access to non-attorney professionals can make all the difference in a \ncase. This is aptly illuminated in a recent homicide trial in Onondaga County. A 17-year old \nmale was charged with second-degree murder and burglary for allegedly killing an 18-year old \nfemale acquaintance and then stealing her television. He was represented by Charles Keller, an \nOnondaga County ACP panel attorney. A key trial issue was the victim’s time of death. The \ndefense’s original forensic pathologist became unavailable at the last minute because of a \nscheduling conflict. The Onondaga County ACP worked with Mr. Keller to ensure that he could \nretain an experienced and credentialed forensic pathologist, who effectively rebutted the \nprosecution’s forensic pathologist about the time of death. Based largely on this testimony, the \n17-year old was found not guilty of second-degree murder. A seasoned reporter from the \nSyracuse Post-Standard, Doug Dowty, contacted ILS after this trial, and explained that he had \nobserved much of it. He remarked that the not guilty verdict likely would not have been possible \nwithout access to a credentialed and experienced forensic pathologist. He further remarked that \nthe trial outcome represented the system working as it should: because of an adequately \nresourced defense, a young man was found not guilty of a murder that he did not commit.      \n \nAs stated above, the Onondaga ACP does not cap hourly rates of experts; it is for this reason that \nMr. Keller could quickly access the services of a reputable expert. But many courts do cap \nhourly rates for experts and other non-attorney professionals, often relying on a 1992 \nAdministrative Order issued by the then-Chief Administrator of Courts setting out guidelines for \nhourly compensation rates for non-attorney services (1992 Guidelines). These Guidelines have \nnot been updated in the twenty-four years since they were issued, and are still often used by \ncourts and assigned counsel programs. Additionally, while County Law § 722-c authorizes courts \nto set an hourly rate for non-attorney supports, it caps payment at $1,000 absent a showing of \n“extraordinary circumstances.” Thus, there are two ways that compensation is limited: \nunreasonably low hourly rates; and a cap on total amount of time spent. \n69 \n \n\n \nThere has been some progress on this issue this year, at least regarding hourly compensation \nrates for non-attorney professionals. On August 8, 2017, the Office of Court Administration’s \nAdministrative Board of the Courts issued a Request for Public Comment on Proposed Increase \nin Hourly Rates of Compensation of Court-Appointed Experts Pursuant to Judiciary Law § 35 \nand County Law § 722-c. The New York State Defender Association (NYSDA) has responded to \nthis request for comment, and ILS has joined NYSDA’s response. (The original request for \npublic comment, NYSDA’s response, and ILS’ letter joining this response are attached to this \nreport as Exhibit A). Notably, in responding to the Administrative Board of Courts’ request for \npublic comments, NYSDA referred to ILS’ 2016 update report as demonstrating the dire need \nfor increased payment of non-attorney professionals. ILS is optimistic that the Administrative \nBoard of Courts will consider NYSDA’s comments and ultimately issue compensation \nguidelines that attract qualified non-attorney professionals so that justice can be done in more \ncases, as it was in the case of Mr. Keller’s 17-year old client.             \n  \nC.  Use of Non-Attorney Professionals: A Necessary Culture Shift \n \nILS’ structured attorney interviews and our very preliminary review of data from Case Closing \nForms suggest that regular use of non-attorney professionals will require a culture shift for the \nHurrell-Harring providers. Because of limited county funding, provider staff attorneys and \nassigned counsel attorneys have consistently confronted severe limits to the use of non-attorney \nprofessionals. For example, in Suffolk County, the Legal Aid Society was never provided \nenough funding for experts. Staff attorneys who needed experts had to apply to the court under \nCounty Law § 722-b for funding, which would be taken from the ACDP’s already limited budget \nline. Attorneys in Washington County Public Defender Office and the Schuyler County Public \nDefender Office similarly would have to apply to the court for the services of experts and other \nnon-attorney professionals. And of course, as described above, all the Hurrell-Harring assigned \ncounsel programs have traditionally been required to apply to courts for any non-attorney \nprofessional service. Often courts would deny use of the service or grant it, but at a lower \namount than needed and with the noncompetitive compensation rates described above.  \n \nThe result is a dearth of qualified non-attorney professionals who are accustomed to working \nwith criminal defense teams. In Ontario County, Ms. Schoeneman has confronted this issue in \nseeking to secure sentencing advocacy services for her program. Settlement funding is available, \nbut Ms. Schoeneman has been struggling for over a year to find such services in Ontario County. \nIn some counties, qualified professionals exist, but refuse to work for public defense providers \nbecause of the difficulty of getting promptly paid at a competitive rate.  \n \nThe enduring barriers to accessing non-attorney professionals have also resulted in a culture of \ntriage, in which defense attorneys seek to access non-attorney professionals only in the most \nserious cases likely to result in a trial. In less serious cases, attorneys have traditionally gone \nwithout. This means, for example, that attorneys are conducting their own investigations or \nrelying solely on the information disclosed by the prosecution. It also means that many attorneys \nsimply have no idea what types of services might be helpful. For example, many attorneys have \nlittle understanding of what a sentencing advocate/mitigation specialist is or how to use one. \n70 \n \n\nAttorneys often comment that they would like to use a social worker, but have been hesitant \nbecause they have never used one since the service was unavailable.   \n        \nILS’ structured attorney interviews and our preliminary review of the data from the Case Closing \nForms suggest that it is going to take some time to change this culture of triage. But the \ninterviews and the data provide clues as to how the culture can be transformed so that use of non-\nattorney professionals becomes the norm rather than the exception. First, training is critical, \nparticularly if the training includes non-attorney professionals. Second, the providers that have \nclear expectations and written protocols regarding use of non-attorney professionals tend to use \nthese services more often. Third, access to these services is critical, as evidenced by the fact that \nthese services are used more often among those providers that have these services in-house. The \nimportance of access is why ILS strongly endorses NYSDA’s comments to the Administrative \nBoard of Courts regarding their proposal to raise the Guideline rates for non-attorney \nprofessionals.  \n \nAs this update report describes, the Hurrell-Harring providers are already implementing \nstrategies to encourage attorneys to use non-attorney professionals more often, including: i) \noffering trainings on use of non-attorney professionals; ii) hiring non-attorney professionals so \nattorneys have access to these services “in-house”; iii) developing retainer agreements with key \nnon-attorney professionals to facilitate access for attorneys; iv) developing protocols and \nexpectations about use of non-attorney professionals; and v) for ACPs, having their own funding \nfor the service so that attorneys may apply to the organization rather than to the court for the \nservice. It will take time and even more creativity for the providers to cultivate pools of non-\nattorney professionals who are qualified and willing to work with people charged with criminal \nconduct. ILS looks forward to continuing to work with the Hurrell-Harring providers on shifting \nthe culture and overcoming the barriers to use of non-attorney professionals. \n \nD.  Client Communication: Jail Access and Poverty \n \nDuring the structured attorney interviews, it was clear that attorneys value effective client \ncommunication. Uniformly, however, they identified two barriers. First, in most of the Hurrell-\nHarring counties jail policies about attorney visits often pose a barrier to communicating in \nperson with detained clients. Jails tend to deny attorneys access for one to two hours mid-day \nand then again in the late afternoon. For some jails, this means that the facility is closed to \nattorney visits for up to 3 hours during the day. Some jails also have very limited confidential \nmeeting space available, and attorneys must compete for this space. Recently, ILS learned of one \njail that bars access to female attorneys wearing underwire bras. \n \nILS urges county officials to become aware of these issues and to work closely with jail officials \nto dismantle needless restrictions on attorney visits of detained clients.  \n \nThe second barrier that attorneys identified is poverty. This is manifested in several ways. \nAttorneys noted that it is often challenging to contact out-of-custody clients because they are \nhomeless, frequently moving, or because their cell phones are not working. Attorneys also \nexpressed frustration that some clients do not prioritize their criminal case. This can be \ndemoralizing for the attorney, but it often occurs because the client is overwhelmed by more \n71 \n \n\nimmediate priorities, such as shelter, food, or childcare. Poverty is also related to a host of other \nbarriers to client communication, including mental health, substance abuse, and a history of \ntrauma. \n \nThere is no quick or easy answer to the barriers that poverty poses to effective client \ncommunication. But ILS is interested in exploring possible strategies with providers. For \nexample, some providers are contemplating the use of text messages as a means of enhancing \nclient communication, especially since low-cost cell phone plans tend to render text messaging \naccessible even when voice calls are not. Many attorneys shared with us an interest in training on \ncultural competency so that they can better understand the perspectives of their clients and \nhence, be more adept at communication strategies. Finally, Suffolk County Legal Aid Society’s \nstrategy of connecting clients to social workers as soon as possible (described above) offers a \npossible strategy for overcoming the barriers that poverty poses to effective client \ncommunication.       \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n           \n \n  \n           \n  \n   \n72 \n \n\nTHE 2017 ASSIGNED COUNSEL SUMMIT \nAs part of the Hurrell-Harring Settlement, ILS has worked with Onondaga, Ontario, Schuyler, \nSuffolk, and Washington counties to improve the quality of their assigned counsel programs. In \ndoing so, we have often sought the advice of four current and former ACP administrators (who \nwe call “advisors”) who are committed to quality representation and are recognized as leaders in \nthe delivery of mandated representation through assigned counsel programs. We have also \nencouraged the Hurrell-Harring ACP administrators to use this group of advisors as a resource. \nThe Hurrell-Harring administrators encouraged us to bring everyone together so that they could \nexchange ideas and ask advisors about their experiences and different strategies they have used.    \nThe resultant ACP Summit was held in Albany on June 15, 2017. The program was jointly \nsponsored by ILS and the Onondaga County ACP. It was the first time in New York State that \nACP administrators came together to discuss issues unique to effectively running a high quality \nassigned counsel program. \nThe following 23 individuals attended: \nAdvisors: \nName  Title \nNancy Bennett  Deputy Chief Counsel, Private Counsel Division, Massachusetts Committee \nfor Public Counsel Services \nBob Lonski  Former Administrator, Erie County Bar Association Assigned Counsel \nProgram \nClaudia Schultz  Former Deputy Administrator, Erie County Assigned Counsel Program \nJulia Hughes  Program Coordinator, Tompkins County Assigned Counsel Program \nLance Salisbury  Supervising Attorney, Tompkins County Assigned Counsel Program \n \nProviders: \nName  Title \nKathy Dougherty  Executive Director, Onondaga County Bar Association Assigned Counsel \nProgram (OCBAACP) \nDave Savlov  Deputy Director, OCBAACP \nLaura Fiorenza  Quality Enhancement Attorney, OCBAACP \nDaniel Russo  Administrator, Assigned Counsel Defender Plan of Suffolk County \nStephanie McCall  Deputy Administrator, Assigned Counsel Defender Plan of Suffolk County \nAndrea Schoeneman  Ontario County Conflict Defender and Assigned Counsel Plan Administrator \nTom Cioffi  Supervising Attorney, Washington County Assigned Counsel Program \nPat Halstead  Tompkins/Schuyler Regional Assigned Counsel Program \n \n \n73 \n \n\nILS and New York State Defenders Association: \nName   Title \nBill Leahy  Director, Office of Indigent Legal Services (ILS) \nJoseph Wierschem  Counsel, ILS \nPatricia Warth  Hurrell-Harring Chief Implementation Attorney \nMatthew Alpern  Director of Quality Enhancement for Criminal Defense, ILS \nAmanda Oren  Hurrell-Harring Quality Improvement Implementation Attorney \nNora Christenson  Hurrell-Harring Caseload Relief Implementation Attorney \nLisa Robertson  Hurrell-Harring Eligibility Standards Implementation Attorney \nMelissa Mackey  Senior Research Associate, ILS \nGiza Lopes  Senior Research Associate, ILS \nCharlie O’Brien  Managing Attorney, New York State Defenders Association (NYSDA) \n \nILS Director Bill Leahy opened the Summit with a welcome and an overview of the Summit’s \nsignificance, highlighting two issues. First, he noted that efforts to improve the quality of \nmandated representation have largely focused on institutional providers. The Hurrell-Harring \nACPs are in the vanguard of putting a spotlight on the importance of quality ACPs. Second, \nproviders have told ILS that they are often working in isolation – a disadvantage of New York’s \ncounty based system of mandated representation. He described the Summit as a significant and \nimportant step toward breaking down silos and supporting providers in developing collaborative \nand supportive approaches to achieving the goal of improved quality. \nThe rest of the day was devoted to topics critical to the delivery of quality representation. ILS’ \nMatt Alpern began by previewing ILS’ forthcoming standards for administering assigned \ncounsel programs. This was followed by Nancy Bennett’s presentation about her “ACP \nchecklist,” which identifies several operational imperatives for assigned counsel programs, \nincluding: building key relationships in the community; attracting quality panel attorneys; \nfostering a culture of accountability and high expectations; getting local bar support; strategies to \ndiminish the impact of statutory hourly rates that are too low; certification of panel attorneys; \nmentoring; training; handling client complaints; and use of awards to foster a culture of pride.  \nParticipants next turned to the unique challenge of implementing caseload standards in assigned \ncounsel programs. Nora Christenson introduced this topic by discussing ILS’ caseload standards \nreport, finalized in December 2016, emphasizing that the standards are not “caps” but instead \nreflect the minimum average number of hours that attorneys should spend in particular types of \ncases. Nancy Bennett and Bob Lonski contributed their experience in implementing caseload \nstandards in their respective programs, identifying the challenges they faced and strategies they \nutilized to address these challenges. Both Bob and Nancy emphasized that caseload standards \nshould inform, but not replace, ACP administrator judgments about case assignments. There are \nseveral subjective factors that must be considered in assessing attorney workloads, including the \n74 \n \n\noverall quality of attorney performance, attorney experience, the seriousness of the cases \nassigned, and the likelihood they would go to trial, etc.   \nThe Summit participants next discussed implementation of recertification protocols, measures of \naccountability, and training requirements for existing panel attorneys. This is a unique challenge \nfor ACPs that traditionally had little quality control oversight, clear expectations, or measures of \naccountability. All the Hurrell-Harring providers described their desire to raise the bar for panel \nattorneys but also their concerns about how to do this without alienating quality panel attorneys \nor subjecting themselves to counterproductive confrontations with panel attorneys. Bob Lonski, \nClaudia Schultz, Lance Salisbury, Julia Hughes, and Nancy Bennett offered a variety of \nstrategies and suggestions. For example, though ACP administrators may feel compelled to \ninitiate a new recertification process with poorer performing attorneys, the more experienced \nACP administrators suggested starting with high performing attorneys as a means of de-\nstigmatizing recertification and fostering credibility in the process. Participants also discussed \nthe many strategies available for improving attorney performance, including mentoring, second \nchair programs, consulting attorneys, and ongoing training with a focus on skill development \ntraining. Overall, the advisors urged the Hurrell-Harring providers to strike the balance between \ntheir sense of urgency (and thus, moving too quickly) and the need to be strategic, and to \nconsider long-term implications of new policies and protocols. Changing the culture, they \nadvised, is a process that takes time and thoughtfulness.        \nAs a final topic, Summit participants discussed the benefits of having the ACPs control case \nassignments but the difficulty of doing so in counties where the judiciary has traditionally \nassigned panel attorneys to cases. This discussion produced several strategies for encouraging \nthe judiciary to defer to the ACPs in case assignments including, for example, building an \nalliance with the local bar association leaders which can then help demonstrate to judges how \njudge-controlled assignments result in an unfair distribution of cases among panel attorneys.  \nThe Summit ended with agreement that the dialogue should continue, and ideas for how to do so \nincluding in-person meetings and phone meetings.   \nPost-Summit, Hurrell-Harring ACP administrators have begun to implement many of the \nstrategies discussed during the Summit. For example, in Suffolk County, Dan Russo and \nStephanie McCall of the Suffolk ACP honored three panel attorneys with awards at its last panel \nattorney meeting as a means of fostering pride and collegiality. In Onondaga County, Laura \nFiorenza is effectively using her weekly email newsletter to build a culture of collegiality, \npromote training programs, and advertise how use of ACP resources (such as mentors, resource \nattorneys, and non-attorney professional services) can make all the difference in case outcomes. \nIn Ontario County, Andrea Schoeneman is using her mentor attorney, Bob Zimmerman, to lead \nmonthly meetings with panel attorneys about topical issues. In Schuyler County, the regional \nACP began its program by first meeting with the judiciary to foster trust and credibility in the \nprogram. In Washington County, Tom Cioffi is coordinating with the Public Defender Office to \nhost in-county Continuing Legal Education (CLE) programs, which panel attorneys view as not \nonly a means of professional development, but also as a previously unavailable opportunity to \nmeet with their colleagues. All the Hurrell-Harring ACPs are using Settlement money to \n75 \n \n\nimplement mentor programs, increase the availability of second chair opportunities, and promote \na variety of training opportunities (from informal lunch-and-learn programs to more intensive \nmulti-day, hands-on skills training). The ACPs are also taking steps to cultivate trust, support, \nand credibility as the first and most important step towards implementing certification protocols \nand measures of accountability.   \nILS looks forward to further fostering the dialogue among Hurrell-Harring providers that started \nwith the 2017 ACP Summit. \n \n \nSome of the June 2017 ACP Summit participants \n \nCONCLUSION \nTremendous progress has been made toward implementing the Hurrell-Harring Settlement in the \nlast two years. This significant achievement results from the commitment of everyone involved \nin the implementation process. The State has stepped up to meet its obligation to fully fund \nHurrell-Harring implementation, including continuing the $2 million each year in Quality \nImprovement funding beyond the two years the Settlement requires. Officials in the Hurrell-\nHarring counties have worked diligently to ensure that their public defense providers can access \nSettlement funding, even when faced with political opposition to spending money on poor people \naccused of crimes. Most critically, the eleven Hurrell-Harring providers have worked tirelessly \n76 \n \n\nto implement the Settlement. These efforts are creating a change in the practice of public \ncriminal defense which is already improving the quality of representation that clients receive, \nand that will endure far beyond the life of the Settlement.  \n \nIn the coming year, ILS looks forward to working with the Hurrell-Harring counties as they \nwork to develop and implement centralized arraignment programs, further their efforts to \nprofessional their assigned counsel programs, and as they work to implement ILS’ caseload \nstandards to ensure that all people accused of a crime are represented by a lawyer who has the \ntime and resources needed to provide high-quality defense.         \n \n77 \n \n\nEXHIBIT A \n\nI\\JEW YORK STATE \nUnified Court Svsrern \n,I \nOFFICE OF COURT ADMINISTRATION \nLAWRENCE K.

McConnell, Counsel, Office of Court Administration \nRe:  Comments on Proposed Increase in the Hourly Rates of Compensation of Court  \nAppointed Experts Pursuant to Judiciary Law§ 35 and County Law§ 722-c \nDate:  October 11, 2017 \nThank you for the opportunity to submit comments regarding the proposed increase in the hourly \nrates of compensation of court-appointed experts pursuant to Judiciary Law§ 35 and County Law§ \n722-c. \nThe New York State Defenders Association (NYSDA) is a not-for-profit membership association; its \nmission is to improve the quality and scope of publicly supported legal representation to low income \npeople. Most ofNYSDA's over 1,700 members are public defenders, legal aid attorneys, assigned \ncounsel, and private practitioners throughout the state, along with others who support the right to \ncounsel, including client members. With funds provided by the State of New York, NYSDA \noperates the Public Defense Backup Center (Backup Center), which offers legal consultation, \nresearch, and training to nearly 6,000 lawyers who represent individuals who cannot afford to retain \ncounsel in criminal and family court cases. As part of its support services to public defense providers \nand state and local governmental entities, NYSDA provides consultation and technical assistance \nabout legal and policy issues relevant to criminal and family court systems, delivery of defense \nservices, and barriers thereto. \nI.  Proposed Increase in Hourly Rates of Compensation Would Help Support the Right to \nPresent a Defense \nNYSDA supports the proposal to increase the hourly rates of compensation of court-appointed \nexperts pursuant to County Law§ 722-c and Judiciary Law§ 35. Public defense clients have a right \nto present a defense1 and are entitled to funds for investigative, expert, and related auxiliary \nservices.2 County Law § 722 specifically provides that \"each plan for public defense representation \n\"shall ... provide for investigative, expert and other services necessary for an adequate defense.\" \nAnd state and national professional standards require that attorneys have access to and use such \n1 See, e.g., Crane v Kentucky, 476 US 683 (1986); People v Aphaylath, 68 NY2d 945 (1986). \n2 \"Essential to any representation, and to the attorney's consideration of the best course of action on \nbehalf of the client, is the attorney's investigation of the law, the facts, and the issues that are \nrelevant to the case.\" People v Oliveras, 21 NY3d 339, 346 (2013). \n\nOctober 11, 2017 \nservices. See New York State Office of Indigent Legal Services (ILS Office), Standards and Criteria \nfiH· the Provision o(Manduted Re.m·esentation in Cases Involving a_ Conflict.2f.Jnterest, 3 Standards 3 \n(access to and use of investigative services as needed to provide quality representation) and 4 (access \nto and use as needed the assistance of experts); ILS Office, Standards fcir Parental Representation in \nState lmsrsmnon MattCJ:!i_, Standards G (Model of Representation-Multidisciplinary Practice), 0-1 \n(Ongoing social work support), and 0-7 (Expert witnesses); American Bar Association, Criminal \nJustice Standards,  Defense Function, Standards 4-4.1 (Duty to Investigate and Engage Investigators) \nand 4-4.4 (Relationship with Expert Witnesses); see also New York Rules of Professional Conduct, \n22 NYCRR Part 1200, Rule l.l(a) (a lawyer must \"provide competent representation to a client. \nCompetent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation \nreasonably necessary for the representation.\"); ILS Office, Standards for Parental R!!m:esentation in \nState lnlervention Matters, Standard B (\"Experience and Training. Counsel must possess sufficient \nexperience, training, knowledge, and skills necessary to provide high quality representation to clients \nin state intervention matters.\"). \nThese constitutional, statutory, and professional mandates can only be meaningfully fulfilled if \nstatutory rates and court guidelines authorize fees that investigators and experts are willing to accept. \nWhile some qualified individuals may offer to work at reduced rates for public defense cases, this is \nnot a practicable basis for a guideline. Setting rates at a level which will attract only those \nprofessionals willing to work for a deflated rate shrinks the pool of available experts and severely \nlimits options for quality services. \nA.  Hourly Rate Guidelines Should Be Based on the Full Cost-of-Living Increase \nThe hourly rate guidelines should be updated to the full cost-of-living amount, not just the proposed \nrate. For the physician, psychologist, and social worker categories, the proposed rate does not align \nwith the full cost-of-living increase. Unfortunately, no explanation is provided for why the proposed \nrate does not match the full cost-of-living increase. Unless there is some evidence that the 1992 \nhourly rate guidelines were higher than the actual hourly rates that experts charged for their services \nat that time and/or that hourly rates have not increased at a rate similar to the standard cost-of-living \nadjustment, there is no justification for adopting new guidelines that are below the full cost-of-living \nincrease. \nWe support the proposal to align the rates of physicians and psychiatrists. There is no reason why a \npsychiatrist's expert witness rate should be, or in reality is, less than that of any other type of \nphysician. \n3 These standards were extended to include all trial level representation effective January 1, 2013. \nSee Standards and Performance Criteria, available at https://www.ils.ny.gov/content/standarc!s-and  \nperfonnance-criteria. \n2 \n\nOctober 11, 2017 \nB.  Hourly Rates Must Be Guidelines, Not a Ceiling \nThe August 8, 2017 memorandum does not state that the proposed hourly rates are intended to be \nguidelines. However, the original rates were described as guidelines in A0/73/92, and the May 17, \n2017 Memorandum from the Attorney for Child Directors notes that the request was for \"changes to \nthe compensation rate guidelines .... \" In the years since the 1992 guidelines were released, we have \nheard from public defense attorneys that some courts have treated the guidelines as a ceiling on \nhourly rates.4 While the newly proposed guidelines are more in line with the current cost ofretaining \ninvestigators and experts, some cases will warrant the retention of experts at an hourly rate above \nthose rates.5 We encourage the Administrative Board of the Courts to continue to treat the hourly \nrates as guidelines and to remind courts that they are guidelines and not hourly rate ceilings. \nC.  Guidelines Should Include a Provision for Adjustment or Review on a Regular Basis \nThe cost of retaining experts, investigators, and other service providers increases on a regular basis6 \nand any new guidelines adopted by the Administrative Board of the Courts should include a \nmechanism for review and adjustment of hourly rates.7 This could be done by adding a provision for \nan annual cost of living adjustment or a direction that a particular office within the Unified Court \nSystem review the rates on a regular basis, perhaps yearly or every two years. This will ensure that \nguideline rates do not remain stagnant for another 25 years and will provide judges, public defense \nproviders, and funders with a more realistic picture of the cost of these critical services. \n4 See, e.g., ILS Office, Implementing the Quality Improvement Objectives in the Hurrell-Harring v. \nThe State of New York Settlement: 2016 Update, at 32-33, available at \nhttps:/Avww.ils.ny.gov/files/Hurrell-Harring/Qualitv%20Improvement/Hurre-11- \nHarrimi%20Updated%200uality%20Improvement%20Plan%20 J 11016.pdf (noting that, although \nthe 1992 Guidelines have not been updated in 24 years, the hourly compensation rates are still often \nused by courts and assigned counsel programs). \n5 There are a number of different reasons why a higher hourly rate may be warranted, such as where \nthe case involves a specialized area of expertise or there are a limited number of experts in the \nrelevant field. \n6 SEAK, Inc. (Skills, Education, Achievement, Knowledge) conducts regular surveys of expert \nwitness fees. https://\\vww.seak.com/expert-witness-fee-study/. In its 2014 report on the aggregate \nexpert witness fee survey results, SEAK noted that expert rates had increased modestly since its \n2009 survey; average fees for testifying at trial increased a total of2.9% over the five-year period \nand the average fees for file review and case preparation have increased 12% over five years. \nhttps:/ h11vw.seak.com/wp-content/uploads/20 l 4/07 /Expert-\\Vitness-Fee-Data.pdf. And the 2017 \nreport on the aggregate survey results noted that \"[ e ]xpert rates have increased well beyond the rate \nof inflation since SEAK's last survey in 2014.\" \n7 In 2006, the Commission on the Future of Indigent Defense Services recommended that the Chief \nAdministrative Judge \"issue a new administrative order updating the hourly rate guidelines, and that \nOCA review the guidelines at least every two years and update them as needed.\" Final Report to the \nChief Judge of the State ofN  ew York(June 18, 2006), Addendum atAD-2, available at \nhttp://ww\\v.courts.state.ny.us/ip/indlgentdefense- \ncommission/lndigentDefenseC omm ission  report06.pdf. \n3 \n\nOctober 11, 2017 \nD.  Guidelines Should Be Expanded to Include More Categories of Experts \nThe 1992 guidelines only address five categories of services, some of which overlap. In the past 25 \nyears, the categories of experts used in criminal and family court cases has expanded. The guidelines \nshould be expanded to include categories such as: interpreting/translation''; medical expertise in \naddition to physicians, such as nursing; DNA; mitigation; interrogation/false confession; eyewitness \nidentification; forensic sciences (fingerprints, ballistics, blood spatter, arson, etc.); accident \nreconstruction; toxicology; pharmacology; engineering; biomechanics; cell phone and other \ntechnology; and forensic accounting. Having additional categories will remind judges, public \ndefense providers, and other members of the criminal and family court systems of the wide spectrum \nof experts that may be needed in individual cases and rate guidelines will offer a starting point for \nassessing the appropriateness of a particular fee request. Whether or not new categories are added to \nthe guidelines, the guidelines should state that it is not an exclusive list of possible experts that are \ncovered by County Law § 722-c. \nE.  Increased Guidelines Will Likely Encourage More Experts to Participate in Public \nDefense Cases and More Applications for Expert Witnesses \nThe low hourly rates have discouraged many investigators and other experts from participating in \npublic defense cases and also discouraged public defense attorneys from filing applications under \nCounty Law § 722-c. In its 2006 report, Status o{Jndigent Defense in NeH' York: A Studv for Chie( \nJudge Kave 's Commission on the Fuwre o(Indigent Legal Services, The Spangenberg Group \nindicated that it \"heard from attorneys in many counties that it is difficult to find experts and \ninvestigators to take cases at the available rates.\"? The report covered a number of related problems: \nlack of guidance on hourly rates; tacit pressure on defense attorneys not to apply for experts to keep \ncosts down; courts \"put in the position of guarding the county's coffer\"; and underutilization of \nexperts as part of the culture of the practice.!\" \nTen years later, the New York State Office of Indigent Legal Services reported similar problems.11 \nNoting that\"[ a]n additional and pressing barrier to quality representation is compensation rates for \n8 Defense attorneys need access to independent interpreters to communicate with their clients. See, \ne.g., ILS Office, Standards for Parental Representation in State Intervention Matters, Commentary \nto Standard F-5 (\"The attorney must ensure access to a competent sign or other language interpreter \nfor all interactions when a communication barrier exists between the client and the attorney .... \nCounsel should not rely on court interpreters for attorney-client communications.\"); The \nSpangenberg Group, Status of Indigent Defense in New York: A Study for Chief Judge Kaye's \nCommission on the Future of Indigent Legal Services (June 16, 2006), at 70-72, available at \nhttp://www.nycourts.gov/ip/indigentdefense-commission/SpangenbergGroupReport.pdf. \n9 The Spangenberg Group, Status of Indigent Defense in New York: A Study for Chief Judge Kaye's \nCommission on the Future of Indigent Legal Services, at 76. \n10 See id.  at 72- 77; see also Commission on the Future of Indigent Legal Services, Final Report to \nthe ChiefJ udge of the State of New York. \n11 ILS Office, Implementing the Quality Improvement Objectives in the Hurrell-Harring v. The State \nofNew York Settlement: 2016 Update, at 32-33. \n4 \n\nOctober 1 1, 2017 \nnon-attorney supports,\" the report described one county where the rates provided by the assigned \ncounsel program for investigators and interpreters were so low that experienced investigators and \ninterpreters stopped taking public defense cases. \nIncreasing the guideline rates, and adopting a regular review of guideline rates, will likely encourage \nmore investigators and experts to work with public defense attorneys. Defenders will gain access to \nmore qualified experts and be encouraged to file applications under County Law § 722-c, thus \nremoving a significant barrier to the provision of quality representation throughout the public \ndefense system. \nII.  Amendment of Statutory Caps Critical to Quality Public Defense Services \nAccording to the August 8, 2017 proposal, it is anticipated that the Unified Court System will seek a \nlegislative amendment to the statutory compensation caps in County Law § 722-c and Judiciary Law \n§ 35(4). NYSDA supports such an amendment. For the increase in the hourly rate guidelines to be \nmeaningful, it must be accompanied by an amendment to these compensation caps. Otherwise, the \nnumber of hours an expert is able to work on a case will be severely limited, except in cases where \nthe court finds that there are \"extraordinary circumstances\" for exceeding the cap. For example, if \nthe hourly rate guideline for a physician is increased to $250, but the statutory cap of $1,000 remains \nin place, then the physician will only be compensated for four hours of work. In most cases, four \nhours is not enough time for a physician to review all of the relevant medical records, let alone \ndiscuss those records and the relevant issues with the attorney. While some courts may agree that \nsuch a limitation meets the standard of \"extraordinary circumstances,\" others would consider this \nentirely ordinary and not approve an expenditure over the cap. \nConclusion \nOverall, NYSDA supports the proposal to increase the hourly rates under County Law § 722-c and \nJudiciary Law§ 35. We encourage the Administrative Board of the Courts to accept the full cost-of  \nliving hourly rate, not the lower proposed rates; alert judges that the rates are guidelines only, not a \nceiling on hourly rates; regularly review the guidelines; and expand the categories of experts \nincluded in the guidelines. We expect that the increase will encourage more providers of expert \nservices to agree to take public defense cases, which will make it easier for defenders to locate \nqualified experts and in tum improve the quality of representation provided to public defense clients. \nHowever, without a change in the statutory caps on expert compensation, the increased guideline \nrates will not have a sufficient impact on the quality of public defense representation. Therefore, we \nalso support the Unified Court System's anticipated effort to seek legislative amendment to the \nJudiciary Law and County Law regarding the cap on expert compensation. \nIf you have any questions regarding these comments, please feel free to contact Charles F. O'Brien, \nExecutive Director, or Susan C.

NY 10004 \nRe:  Request for Comment on Proposed tncreascs in \nCompensation Rates for Court-Appointed Experts \nDear Mr. McConnell: \nThis submission is in response to your request for comments on proposed increases in the hourly rates of \ncompensation paid to experts appointed by the court. pursuant to Judiciary La\\\\'§ 35 and County Law§ 72:..-c. \nThe Office of Indigent Legal Services applauds the proposal, and endorses and adopts the comments of the New \nYork State Defenders Association. NYSDA supports the proposed increases and recommends additional reforms \nthat would advance our mission=-improving the quality of mandated representation in this State. \nAs NYSDA states, the proposed  increase in hourly rates of compensation will encourage more experts to \nparticipate in public defense cases. cause defense counsel to make more applications for experts. and improve \nthe quality of representation to clients. The proposed increase is also consistent with I LS Standards regarding \nthe use of experts, social workers, and investigative and other services (Standards and Criteria for the Provision \nof Mandated Representation in Cases Involving a Conflict of Interest, Standards 3, 4; Standards for Parental \nRepresentation in State Intervention Matters, Standards F-5, G, 0-L 0-7}. ILS also supports OCA's proposed \nlegislative amendment to the statutory caps. so that extraordinary circumstances will not need to be shown when \nexperts provide services for more than several hours at the increased rates. \nWe agree with NYSDA that additional reforms should be implemented. The guidelines should stale that they do \nnot enumerate an exclusive list of possible experts, given the wide spectrum of experts often needed to provide \neffective representation. Further, we are in accord with NYSDA that the hourly rate guidelines should provide \nfor a full cost-of-living increase for physicians, psychologists, and social workers, and that the new rates for \npsychiatrists should similarly increase so that they are aligned with physician rates.  In addition, trial courts \nshould be reminded by the Administrative Board of the Courts that the hourly rates are not ceilings. As our \nOffice has found, although the 1992 Guidelines have not been updated, the rates stated therein are often applied \n(Implementing the Quality Improvement Objectives in rue Hurrell-Harring 1·. Slate of New York Settlement: \n2016 Update. at 32-33). Finally, to ensure that the rates do not remain stagnant going forward. the amended \nguidelines should provide a mechanism for regular adjustments. \nVery truly yours, \nILS Director of Quality Enhancement for \nAppellate and Post-Conviction Representation \n\"The right.. to counsel may not be deemE-d fundamentat and essential to ialr trials in some countries, but it is in oms.\" \nGitf{'t,n v Vl:,ir;v;nght. 37\"1.
