    "summary": "<p>On April 24, 2007, non-profit public interest corporations and a regional network of peace and social justice groups filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201, against the Miami-Dade County and the Miami-Dade College. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, sought declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief. They alleged that the local ordinance that employed a permit scheme for expressive activities in public fora was subject to arbitrary enforcement, and that the loitering ordinance was unconstitutionally vague, in violation of their rights to free expression under the First Amendment.</p><p>The plaintiffs intended to hold an anti-war demonstration near the campus entrance during a commencement address by the then president at Miami-Dade College on April 28, 2007. The County's permit scheme required the plaintiffs to obtain a lane closure permit for their proposed parade route and rally, but the County refused to accommodate them. Without a permit, the participants of the parade would be forced to crowd onto the sidewalks, which would likely violate the County's loitering ordinance. The plaintiffs feared that the County would penalize their members and shut down the parade. Feeling that their freedom of speech was infringed, the plaintiffs challenged the permit and loitering ordinances. </p><p>The parties reached an agreement regarding the April 28 demonstration after the initial complaint was filed. The plaintiffs agreed to march and rally on designated sidewalks and grassy areas, and the defendant agreed not to enforce the loitering ordinance against the plaintiffs during the protest. Given the agreement, on April 26, 2007, the District Court (Judge Cecilia M. Altonaga) denied the plaintiffs' emergency motion for a preliminary injunction. The April 28 demonstration was able to proceed. </p><p>On May 11, 2007, the plaintiffs stipulated to voluntarily dismiss the case against the Miami-Dade College. The Court granted the stipulation on the same day. The Miami-Dade County remained as the only defendant in this case. On September 14, 2007, the plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint. </p><p>On June 4, 2008, the Court granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and issued a permanent injunction banning the County's future enforcement of the permit and loitering ordinances. The Court further ordered the parties to schedule a mediation regarding compensatory damages and attorneys' fees. In the opinion, Judge Altonaga found that the permit ordinance was constitutionally overbroad due to the unlimited discretion provided to the County officials and the lack of procedural safeguards. In addition, the Court declared the loitering ordinance unconstitutionally vague, because the ordinance failed to provide people with fair notice and encouraged arbitrary enforcement. </p><p>On August 20, 2008, the parties stipulated a settlement agreement, in which  the County agreed to pay the plaintiffs compensatory damages and attorneys' fees. The Court consented to the stipulation in its August 22 Final Judgment. This ended the case. </p>",

M-D County Code § 30-274 violates the First Amendment in several key \nrespects. First the challenged code section regulating parades is an unlawful prior restraint as \nit requires permission from the sheriff for any \"parade\" or \"procession\" in Miami-Dade \nCounty, but contains no standards for obtaining permission. The M-D County Code does not \nset out a procedural process for filing a permit, sets no time by which a decision to grant or \ndeny the requested permit must be made, and sets no standards for making the decision.  In \nshort, the M·-D County Code is overbroad, vague and lacks any standards or guidelines to \ncheck the unbridled discretion of Miami-Dade County (\"M-D County\") officials to use \ncontent-based factors to decide who may or may not \"speak\" in the public fora.  This law is \npresumptively unconstitutional,  as  are  all  prior restraints,  and  fails  the test applied to \nreasonable time, place or manner regulations. In addition, M-D County's loitering ordinance \nis violative of First Amendment free speech and Fourteenth Amendment due process rights. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nThe relevant factual information is set out in the Verified Complaint at Paragraphs 3 \nthrough 23, and incorporated as though fully set forth herein. \n2 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 5      Entered on FLSD Docket 04/24/2007     Page 3 of 15\nLEGAL ARGUMENT \nPOINT 1  PLAINTIFFS HAVE STANDING TO CHALLENGE THE CODE \nPlaintiffs have standing to bring a facial challenge to the subject Code st:ctions on two \nbases. First, they have standing as entities subject to the requirements of the permit scheme. \nCity ofL akewood v. Plain Dealer Publishing Co., 486 U.S. 750, 755-56 (1988); CAMP Legal \nDefense Fund, Inc. v. City ofA  tlanta, 451 F.3d 1257, 1274 (11th Cir. 2006).  Plaintiffs plan \nto engage in expressive activities covered by the Code to protest the policies of the Bush \nAdministration and the Iraq War on April28, 2007.  Plaintiffs plan to march and protest and, \nas such, are subject to the provisions of the Miami-Dade County Code§ 30-274.  Plaintiffs \nhave, as of yet, been unable to obtain a permit as required by§ 30-274 and as a result are \nsubject to criminal penalties for illegal assembly. \nPlaintiffs also have standing because of the risk of a chilling effect on the protected \nexpression of others not before the Court.  Under this well-established exception to Article \nIII standing, challenges may be made to \"laws that are written so broadly that they may \ninhibit the constitutionally protected speech of third parties.\" Members oft he City Council of \nthe City ofL os Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789,798 (1984). \"[T]he Supreme \nCourt and this [Circuit] consistently have permitted facial challenges to prior restraints on \nspeech without requiring the plaintiff to show that there are no conceivable set of facts where \nthe application of the particular government regulation might or would be constitutional.\" \nUnited States v.  Frandsen, 212 F.3d 1231  (11th Cir. 2000) (citations omitted).  Accord, \nAbramson v. Gonzalez, 949 F.2d 1567, 1573 (11th Cir. 1992) (facial challenge proper as the \nrule \"affects the enjoyment of freedoms which the Constitution guarantees and subjects the \nexercise of First Amendment freedoms to licensing requirements\").  When free speech may \nbe chilled, society's interest in reviewing an unconstitutional law offsets the usual concern of \nfederal courts to avoid deciding constitutional questions if possible.  As the Supreme Court \nobserved in Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement, 505 U.S. 123, 129-130 (1992): \n3 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 5      Entered on FLSD Docket 04/24/2007     Page 4 of 15\n[I]n the area of freedom of expression an overbroad regulation may be subject \nto facilal review and invalidation, even though its application in the case under \nconsideration may be constitutionally unobjectionable ....T  his exception from \ngeneral standing rules is based on an appreciation that the very existence of \nsome broadly written laws has the potential to chill the expressive activity of \nothers not before the court. \nPOINT 2  PLAINTIFFS  SATISFY  THE  REQUISITE  CRITERIA  FOR  THE \nISSUANCE OF A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nA  pn~liminary injunction is  proper if a plaintiff establishes  four  elements:  1)  a \nsubstantial likelihood of success on the merits; 2) the likelihood of irreparablt:: injury unless \nthe injunction issues; 3) the balance of harms tips in favor of the moving party; and, 4) if \nissued, the injunction would not be adverse to the public interest.  McDonald's Corp.  v. \nRobertson, 147 F.3d 1301 (11th Cir. 1998).  Plaintiffs readily meet each part of this test. \nA.  There Is a Substantial Likelihood That Plaintiffs Will Succeed on the Merits \n1. Miami-Dade County's Permit Scheme is a Prior Restraint that Violates the \nFirst Amendment as an Impermissibly Overbroad Provision \n'\"A prior restraint on expression exists when the government can deny access to a \nforum for expression before the expression occurs.\" Frandsen, 212 F.3d at 1236-37.  The \nprovision in M-D County Code§ 30-274 that requires prior approval or notification before a \nmarch can occur places a prior restraint on free speech.  There is a strong presumption \nagainst the constitutionality ofp  rior restraints on free speech. Bourgeois v. Peters, 3 87 F .3d \n1303, 1319 (11th Cir. 2004 ).  This is so because a '\"[p ]rior restraint upon spet~ch suppresses \nthe precise freedom which the First Amendment sought to protect against abridgment.\" \nCarroll v. Pres. & Commissioners ofP  rincess Anne, 393 U.S. 175, 181 (1968).  Ordinances \nthat place a prior restraint on speech by requiring '\"before-the-fact permitting and licensing \nschemes\" to the point that they create '\"an impermissible risk of suppression of ideas\" will be \nfound to be unconstitutionally overbroad.  Forsyth County, 505 U.S. at 129. \n4 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 5      Entered on FLSD Docket 04/24/2007     Page 5 of 15\nA prior restraint must contain basic procedural safeguards to ensure that protected \nexpression is not inhibited.  At a minimum, it must allow for prompt judicial review in the \nevent the permit is denied or unduly burdened.  Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U.S. 51, 58-59 \n(1965).  See also Forsyth County,  505 U.S. at 123.  \"Meaningful judicial review is the \ntouchstone of the [prior restraint] test.  'Prompt judicial review must be available to correct \nerroneous denials of access to expression.\"'  Bourgeois, 387 F.3d at 1319-20.  Because it \nlacks  any  time  for  deciding  a permit application,  the  County's Code misses the mark \ncompletely.  See Redner v.  Dean, 29 F.3d 1495,  1502 (11th Cir.  1994) (\"ordinance ... \ninadequate under any interpretation of 'prompt judicial review' because it creates the risk that \nexpressive activity could be suppressed indefinitely prior to any judicial review of the \ndecision to deny a license\"). \n2.  The Ordinance Lacks Adequate Safeguards to Check the Unbridled Discretion of \nOfficials in Implementing the Miami-Dade County Permit Scheme \nIt is black letter law that any attempt to subject \"the exercise of First Amendment \nfreedoms to the prior restraint of a license, without narrow, objective, and definite standards \nto guide the licensing authority is unconstitutional.\"  Shuttlesworth v.  City ofBirmingham, \n394 U.S. 147, 150-51 (1969).  See also Forsyth County, 505 U.S. at 132.  A law regulating \nspeech in public fora fails if it \"delegate[ s] overly broad licensing discretion\" to officials. !d. \nat 130.  Miami-Dade County Code§ 30-274 requires persons interested in planning a parade \nor procession to obtain a permit from the \"Sheriff.\"  However, the Code dm:s not indicate \nhow to apply for the permit, how long the process should take, what the basis of approval or \ndenial of a permit is; the Code is totally bereft of any detail. \n\"It is settled ... that an ordinance which ... makes peaceful enjoyment of \nfreedoms which the Constitution guarantees contingent upon the uncontrolled \nwill of an official-as by requiring a permit or license which may be granted or \nwithheld in the discretion of such official-is an unconstitutional censorship or \nprior restraint upon the enjoyment of those freedoms.\" \n5 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 5      Entered on FLSD Docket 04/24/2007     Page 6 of 15\nShuttlesworthv. CityofBirmingham, 394 U.S. 147, 149-51 (1969)quotingStaubv. Baxley, \n355 U.S. 313, 322 (1957). (emphasis added). \nWhen there are no clear standards upon which an official can make these decisions, or \nstandards can be applied differently to different types of gatherings, an ordinance will not be \nupheld.  See Bourgeois, 387 F .3d at 1317 (holding a restriction is invalid when no standards \nappear anywhere, no limitations are listed, and there is '\"no circumscribing of the absolute \npower\" of the decision-maker).  \"To curtail that risk, a law subjecting the ex1~rcise of First \nAmendment freedoms to the prior restraint of a license must contain narrow, objective, and \ndefinite standards to guide the licensing authority.\"  Forsyth County, 505 U.S. at 130-31. \nStandards provide the guideposts that check the licensor and allow courts \nquickly and easily to determine whether the licensor is discriminating \nagainst disfavored speech.  Without these guideposts, post hoc \nrationalizations by the licensing official and the use of shifting or \nillegitimate criteria are far too easy, making it difficult for courts to \ndetermine whether the licensor is permitting favorable, and suppressing \n1 \nunfavorable expression. City ofL  akewood, 486 U.S. at 758.\nThe M-D County Code lacks the narrow and specific guidelines needed to check official \ndiscretion.  So,  it  is  not  \"narrowly  drawn\"  in  a  manner  sufficient  to  pass  the  First \nAmendment's dictates. \nIt matters not if M-D County may never have applied the Code in a content-based \nmanner.  A facial challenge to a permit scheme that '\"delegates overly broad discretion to the \ndecision-maker rests not on whether the administrator has exercised his discretion in a \ncontent-based manner, but whether there is anything in the ordinance preventing him from \ndoing so.\"  Forsyth, 505 U.S. at 133 and n.10; accord, City ofL  akewood, 486 U.S. at 757 \n(\"mere existence of licensor's unfettered discretion, coupled with the power of prior restraint, \nintimidates parties into censoring their own speech, even if the discretion and power are \nnever actually abused\"). \"The First Amendment does not permit the government to place \n1  Even content-neutral time, place and manner rules require adequate standards to guide the \ndecisionmaker's determination.  Thomas v. Chicago Park District, 534 U.S. 316, 323 (2002). \n6 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 5      Entered on FLSD Docket 04/24/2007     Page 7 of 15\nburdens on speech and assembly in ... an unprincipled, ad hoc manner[,]\" Bourgeois, 387 \nF .3d at 1318,. and neither this Court nor the public can \"depend on the individuals responsible \nfor enforcing [a regulation] to do so in a manner that cures [the law]  of constitutional \ninfirmities[.]\" Frandsen, 212 F.3d at 1240. \nMiami-Dade County Code§ 30-274 requires permission issued by the sheriff for any \n\"procession or parade,\" but contains absolutely no time for filing or time by which a permit \nwould be decided.  For nearly four decades, the United States Supreme Comt has condemned \nsimilar laws imposing lengthy advance filing requirements.  \"[T]iming is of the essence in \npolitics ... and when an event occurs, it is often necessary to have one's voice heard \npromptly, if it is to be considered at all.\"  Shuttlesworth, 394 U.S. at 163.  Here, County \nofficials are unconstrained by any textual limits in the Code from holding a permit request \nuntil the last moment, only then to deny it for unspecified reasons, leaving no opportunity to \nseek prompt judicial review of the denial of a permit. \nThe fatal lack of a time by which to decide a permit application is compounded here \nbecause the Code is devoid of standards on other key provisions.  M-D County Code § 30-\n274 requires permission of the sheriff to \"parade,\" but does not state how permission is \nobtained.  \"Excessive discretion over permitting decisions is constitutionally suspect because \nit creates th~;: opportunity for undetectable censorship and signals a lack of narrow tailoring.\" \nBurk  v. Augusta Richmond County, 365 F.3d 1247, 1256 (11th Cir. 2004). Because M-D \nCounty's Code embodies \"[e]xcessive discretion over permitting decision,\" it fails this key \ntest of constitutional adequacy. \n3.  Miami-Dade County Code§ 30-274 is Not a Reasonable Time, Place or Manner \nRegulation \nThe County regulates core expressive activity in virtually all public fora.  \"In such \nplaces, which occupy a 'special position in terms of First Amendment protection,' United \nStates v.  Grace, 461 U.S. 171, 180 (1983), the government's ability to restrict expressive \n7 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 5      Entered on FLSD Docket 04/24/2007     Page 8 of 15\nactivity 'is very limited.' !d. at 177 .\" Boos v. Barry, 485 U.S. 312, 318 (1988).  Time, place, \nand manner restrictions in traditional public fora are constitutional as long as they are \ncontent-neutral,2 are narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest, and leave \nopen ample alternative channels to communicate the message.  Clark v.  Community for \nCreative Non-Violence, 468 U.S. 288,293 (1984).  The failure to meet any prong is fatal \nto the entin~ law.  Perry Educ. Ass 'n v.  Perry Local Educators' Ass 'n, 406 U.S. 36, 45 \n(1983) (emphasis supplied).  The City's scheme violates all three prongs. \nFirst,  Miami-Dade  County  Code  Section  30-274  is  not  a  content-neutral \nregulation.  To pass constitutional muster, a time, place or manner regulation of speech in a \ntraditional public forum must be content-neutral.  Clark v.  Community for Creative Non \nViolence,  468 U.S. at 293.  If the decision involves the \"appraisal of facts, the exercise of \njudgment, and the formation of an opinion,\" it is content-based and the \"the danger of \ncensorship and of abridgment of our precious First Amendment freedoms is too great to be \npermitted.\"  Forsyth,  505  U.S.  at  131  [internal citations omitted].  The County's Code \ncontains no standards for deciding permits. Officials may decide based on the: content of the \nspeech and, for disfavored speakers, delay or deny the permit, or impose onerous conditions. \nFor this reason, Miami-Dade County Code § 30-274 is not content-neutral. \nSecond, even assuming content-neutrality, the County cannot meet its burden to \nprove that the  permit scheme is  narrowly-tailored.  While \"[t]he State ... has a strong \ninterest in ensuring the public safety and order, in promoting the free flow of traffic on public \nstreets and sidewalks ... ,\" at the same time, when First Amendment rights are at issue, the \ngovernment has the burden of showing that the law is narrowly tailored and that there is \nevidence supporting its proffered justification. In this regard, it is important to underscore \nthat \"[courts] have never accepted mere conjecture as adequate to carry a First Amendment \n2 A content-base:d restriction is subject to the more stringent requirement that it be \"necessary to serve a \ncompelling state interest,\" and be \"narrowly drawn to achieve that end.\"  Boos, 485 U.S. at 321. \nHowever, it is not necessary to examine whether Section 30-274 of the Miami-Dade County Code meets \nthis more stringent test, because as shown herein, it cannot even satisfy the less exacting standard for \ncontent-neutral time, place, and manner restrictions. \n8 \n\n·----------------\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 5      Entered on FLSD Docket 04/24/2007     Page 9 of 15\nburden.\" Nixon v.

To prove \nnarrowly tailoring, the County must show actual, not speculative harm, and that the disputed \nlaws actually address that harm.  !d. \nEven a content-neutral law is not narrowly-tailored \"[w]here the licensing official \nenjoys unduly broad discretion ... to grant or deny a permit, [as] there is a risk that he will \nfavor or disfavor speech based on its content.\" Thomas, 534 U.S. at 323, citing Forsyth \nCounty,  505  U.S.  at  131. \"A government regulation that allows arbitrary application is \n'inherently  inconsistent with  a valid  time,  place  and  manner regulation  because  such \ndiscretion has the potential for becoming a means of suppressing a particular point of view.'\" \nForsyth County, 505 U.S. at 132 (citation omitted). \nThe  Supreme Court \"requires that  a time,  place and manner regulation contain \nadequate standards to guide the official's decision and render it subject to effective judicial \nreview.\"  534 U.S. at 323, citing Niemotko v. Maryland, 340 U.S. 268 (1951). The ordinance \nin Thomas included express bounds on the bases for denying a permit, required officials to \nprocess applications within 28 days and explain in writing any denials. Thomas, 534 U.S. at \n32. These were held to be sufficiently specific and objective to insulate against the exercise \nof the \"whim of the administrator.\" !d., citing Forsyth County,  505 U.S. at 133.  \"They \nprovide  'narrowly  drawn,  reasonable  and  definite  standards'  to  guide  the  licensor's \ndetermination .... And they are enforceable on review- first by appeal to the General \nSuperintendent of the Park District,  ... and then by writ of common-law 'certiorari in the \nIllinois courts[.]\"  534 U.S. at 32.  By way of contrast, in the instant case Defendant Miami \nDade's Code lacks any standards and any opportunity for review. \nAbsent  the  safeguards  present  in  Thomas,  the  County's  pennit  scheme  is \nunconstitutional.

Such \"[e  ]xcessive discretion over permitting decisions is constitutionally suspect \nbecause it creates the opportunity for undetectable censorship and signals a lack of narrow \ntailoring.\"  Burk, 365 F. 3d at 1256 (emphasis added). \nThird,  the  permit  scheme  fails  to  leave  open  ample  alternatives  for \ncommunication.  It is  a cardinal rule of First Amendment law that \"[the:]  streets  [and \nsidewalks] are natural and proper places for the dissemination of information and opinion; \nand one is not to have the exercise of his liberty of expression in appropriate places abridged \non the plea that it may be exercised in some other place.\"  Thornhill, 310 U.S. at 105-106 \n[citations omitted].  The County's Code does not allow for ample alternatives for core \nexpression within the County.  If a permit for a parade or procession is not obtained, the \ngroup is thereby foreclosed from all public fora in the County. Even the sidewalks are \nunavailable to Plaintiffs since they are potentially subject to arrest under the Miami-Dade \nCounty Loitering Ordinance found at M-D County Code § 21-31.1.(b ). \n4.  The Loitering Ordinance is Impermissibly Vague and Overbroad Under the First \nAmendment  as  it  Unreasonably  Restricts  Protected  Expressive  Activity  in \nQuintessential Public For a \nThe loitering provisions of§ 21-31.l.(b) of the Miami-Dade County Code  make it \nunlawful to be on a public street, public sidewalk, public overpass, public bridge or public \nplace \"to hinder or impede pedestrians or vehicles.\" This same Section makes it a crime to \n\"loiter[] in or about a school, college or university campus\" when doing so would \"hinder or \nimpede  the  orderly  conduct  of .  .  .  school  activities.''  All  of these  restrictions  are \nimpermissible under the First Amendment. \n10 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 5      Entered on FLSD Docket 04/24/2007     Page 11 of 15\nThe  overbreadth doctrine  invalidates  laws that inhibit the  free  e:xercise  of First \nAmendment--protected activities.  City of Chicago v.  Morales,  527 U.S. 41,  52  (1999). \nPeaceful protest on public sidewalks is a quintessential First Amendment activity.  See e.g., \nPerry, 460 U.S. at 45; Gregory v. City ofC  hicago, 394 U.S. 111, 112 (1969).  The City may \nnot \"make criminal the peaceful expression of unpopular views .... 'unless shown likely to \nproduce a clear and present danger of a serious substantive evil that rises far above public \ninconvenience, annoyance, or unrest.\"'  Terminiello v.  Chicago, 347 U.S. 1, 4-5 (1949). \nThe ability to restrict assemblies on sidewalks based on any conceivable \"obstruction\" \nis unlawful. In Cox v Louisiana, 379 U.S. 536 (1965), the Supreme Court overturned the \nconvictions of civil rights activists.  Two thousand students assembled peaceably at the state \ncapitol building and marched to the courthouse, where fellow activists arrestE:d earlier were \nbeing held.  With official permission, but without a permit, they assembled on the sidewalk \nacross the street from the courthouse and, in a lawful manner, rallied and marched.  When \nthey failed to disperse pursuant to a police order indicating that they had exceeded their time \nfor demonstrating, they were arrested for obstructing a sidewalk. \nAn ordinance is overbroad where every application creates an impermissiable risk of \nsuppression of ideas, such as when an ordinance allows unfettered discretion in one decision \nmaker or where the ordinance sweeps too broadly to penalize constitutionally-protected \nspeech.  Forsyth County, 505 U.S. at 129-30. The Supreme Court has consistently held that \nordinances are unconstitutionally broad under the circumstances noted in Cox and Forsyth, as \nthese ordinances would allow punishment for peaceful protest involving disfavored views. \nThe  Court also held that the conviction under a  statute banning obstruction of public \nsidewalks was a clear violation of freedom of speech and assembly where the \"obstruction\" \nordinance was coupled, as here, with the unfettered discretion of local officials to regulate \nthe use of streets for peaceful parades and assemblies.  Precedent requin:s that Section 21-\n31.l.(b) be invalidated. \n11 \n\n_______ \n, \nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 5      Entered on FLSD Docket 04/24/2007     Page 12 of 15\n5.

Cily of Chicago v. \nMorales, 527 U.S. 41, 56 (1999).  M-D County's Loitering Ordinance is unconstitutionally \nvague, in part because there is uncertainty about what type of loitering would be considered \ncriminal conduct, and which conduct would not fall within its sweep. !d. at 57.  Courts have \nconsistently invalidated laws or ordinances that do not join the crime of loitering with a \nsecond  specific  element.  !d.  at  58.  Miami-Dade  County's  Loitering  Ordinance  is \nunconstitutionally vague because it fails  to  alert the public to what type of conduct is \nprohibited since M-D County could not \"conceivably have meant to criminaliz~:;~ each instance \na citizen stands in public.\"  See !d. at 57. \nFreedom to loiter \"for innocent purposes\" is a liberty interest protected by the Due \nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  City ofC  hicago v. Morales, 527 U.S. 41, 53 \n(1999).  The Supreme Court has held that a person's decision to remain in \"a public place of \nhis choice\" or to move to another place upon his own inclination is \"as rnueh a part of ... \nliberty as the freedom of movement inside frontiers that is 'a part of our heritage.'\" !d. citing \nKent  v.

Miami-Dade  County  Cod<~§ 21-3l.l(b) \nunconstitutionally restricts the liberty interest of Plaintiffs by criminalizing standing or \nremaining on public streets, sidewalks, overpasses, bridges, and places.  Plaintiffs have a \nconstitutional right to stand or remain on a public place if their conduct is not injurious or \nthreatening.  Miami-Dade County's Loitering Ordinance violates critically important due \nprocess rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, and is invalid. \n12 \n\n~---------------\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 5      Entered on FLSD Docket 04/24/2007     Page 13 of 15\nB.

City \nofJ acksonville, 896 F.2d 1283, 1285 (11th Cir. 1990). As noted above, Miami-Dade County \nCode§ 30-274 constitutes an impermissible prior restraint on free speech,, and accordingly \nviolates the First Amendment. \nC.  The Balance of Hardships Favors Plaintiffs \nThe injury to the Plaintiffs as a result of the provisions requiring advance permitting \nand unbridled discretionary authority is the violation of their First Amendme:nt right to free \nspeech, assembly and association.  Such an egregious violation of civil rights poses a grave \nhardship to Plaintiffs seeking to convey their political and social justice messages.  The \nDefendants are not similarly harmed. M-D County and Miami-Dade College may need to add \nadditional law enforcement officers to enhance security, but such a hardship is no greater \nthan any  other increase in security a municipality or university might face  when large \nnumbers of people gather together, such as at a concert or sporting event.  Defendants are \nstill free to maintain the peace by enforcing existing criminal laws to keep an area secure. \nThe granting of injunctive relief to Plaintiffs will not alter this prerogative.

Furthermore, it is not \nin the public interest to support a governmental entity's expenditure of time, effort and \nmoney in order to enforce an unconstitutional ordinance. Fla. Businessmen for Free Enter. v. \nCity ofHonvwood, 648 F.2d 956,959 (5th Cir. 1981). The public interest is clearly in favor \nof Plaintiffs and, thus, injunctive relief should be granted. \nCONCLUSION \nMiami-Dade County Code § 30-274 violates the First Amendment in several key \nrespects.  The Parades and Processions Ordinance is an unlawful prior restraint.  The Code \nis overbroad, vague and lacks any standards or guidelines to check the unbridled discretion of \nthe County officials to use content-based factors to decide who may or may not \"speak\" in \nthe  public  fora.  The  Loitering  Ordinance,  M-D  County  Code  §  21.31.1(b),  is \nunconstitutionally vague and overbroad and thereby violates First Amendment free speech \nand F ourte~;!nth Amendment due process rights. For the reasons mentioned hereinabove, the \nenforcement of both code provisions should be enjoined by this tribunal.. \n14 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 5      Entered on FLSD Docket 04/24/2007     Page 15 of 15\nW.

This  action  seeks  declaratory  and injunctive  relief pursuant to  42  U.S.C. \n§1983,  for  ongoing  and  threatened  injury  to  the  First  Amendment  and  Fourteenth \nAmendment rights of organizations engaged in lawful expressive activity within Miami \nDade County.  This Court has jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 1331 and 1343 and the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§2201 and 2202. \n2.  Venue is proper in the Southern District of Florida, Miami Division, under \n28 U.S.C.  §139l(b).  All parties reside in or are headquartered the Southern District, all \nDefendants an: located in the Miami Division, and all of the acts or omissions complained \nof herein have occurred or will occur in the Miami Division. \nINTRODUCTION \n3.  ~v1iami-Dade County (hereinafter \"M-D County\") employs a permit scheme \nfor  expressive  activity  in  public  fora  that  is  both  an  unlawful  prior restraint  and  an \nunreasonable time, place and manner regulation.  Adopted in 1973, it requires a \"permit \nissued by the  Sheriff' for every \"parade or procession.\"  The ordinance  is  absolutely \ndevoid of any standards to guide the decision of whether and under what conditions a \npermit will issue, how long public officials are allowed to decide whether they will issue a \npermit, and what conditions may be imposed on expressive activities.  The absence of \nany  standards  in  these  key  areas  means  that the  ordinance vests  public  officials with \nunbridled  discretion  and  invites  content-based  decisions  based  on  the  nature  of the \nspeaker.  This is a forbidden basis on which to rest a permit scheme that requires a license \nto  engage in protected speech; the standardless permit scheme violates Plaintiffs'  First \nAmendment rights by impermissible limiting their rights to speech, association, assembly \n2 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 1      Entered on FLSD Docket 04/24/2007     Page 3 of 41\nand petition.  For these reasons, the Defendants must be enjoined from prohibiting the \nlawful exercist:: of First Amendment-protected activity.  Further, the the Pllaintiffs seek a \ndeclaration that the county's \"loitering ordinance\" is a violation of Due Process insofar as \nit is vague and an abrogation of protected liberty interests, and further seek injuctive relief \nprecluding the enforcement of said ordinance by the Defendants. \nPARTIES \nPlaintiffs \n4.  Plaintiff MIAMI  FOR  PEACE  (hereinafter  \"MFP\")  is  a  not-for-profit \ncorporation located in Miami, Florida, incorporated in Florida since 2003  [Declaration of \nLinda Belgrave, dated April 19, 2007, hereinafter \"Belgrave Decl.,\" at, 3].

A website providing additional details regarding the demonstration is located \nat http://w\\vw .. rcjcctbushmiami.com.  [Belgrave Decl. at~ 5]. \nMiami-Dade County Code Provisions: \n11.  Miami-Dade County has an antiquated permit scheme for  all parades in the \nunincorporated  portions  of the  county,  first  adopted  in  1971  and  last  revised  in  1973. \nProvisions of this type have been repeatedly condemned insofar as they are clearly violative \nof First Amendment protections for the freedoms of speech, assembly and petition. \n6 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 1      Entered on FLSD Docket 04/24/2007     Page 7 of 41\n12.  Miami-Dade Code§ 30-274:  Parades and processions; permit required \nIn the unincorporated areas, no procession or parade, excepting \nthe forces of United States Armed Services, the military forces \nof the State, the forces of the police and fire departments, and \nfuneral processions, shall occupy, march, or proceed along any \nstreet or roadway except in accordance with a permit issued by \nthe  Sheriff and  such other regulations  as  are  set  forth  herein \nwhich may apply. \n13.  Miami-Dade  County  has  a  code  provision  criminalizing  the:  standing  or \nremaining on any public sidewalk or public place so as to hinder or impede the passage of \npedestrians or vehicles; this section was  first  adopted in  1967, and last revised in  1982. \nThis  criminalization  of loitering  contains  no  exception  for  First  Amendment-protected \nactivity or for innocent conduct protected by federal jurisprudence. \n14.  Miami-Dade  County  Code  §  21-31.1:  Disorderly  Condud,  Loitering, \nJ>enalties. \n(b)  Loitering.  For the purpose of this section \"loitering\" means. \nthe act of standing, remaining or sleeping on,  in  or about any \npublic  street,  public  sidewalk,  public  overpass,  public bridge,. \npublic library or other place specifically enumerated herein.  A \nperson commits the offense of loitering when he knowingly: \n( 1) Loiters on any public street, public sidewalk, public: \noverpass, public bridge or public place so as to hinder or \nimpede the passage of pedestrians or vehicles. \n( 4)  Loiters  in  or about a school,  college or university \ncampus so as to hinder to impede the orderly conduct of \ninstructional, recreational or other school activities. \n(c)  Penalties for violation.  . .. Any person convicted of a \nviolation  of  any  other  subsection  of this  section  shall  bt:: \npunished  by  a  fine  of five  hundred  dollars  ($500.00)  or  by \n7 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 1      Entered on FLSD Docket 04/24/2007     Page 8 of 41\nimprisonment in the County Jail for a term not to exceed sixty \n(60)  days,  or  by  both  such  fine  and  imprisonment,  in  llhe \ndiscretion of the court.  This  section is  applicable in both the \nincorporated and unincorporated areas of Miami-Dade County \nand  all  violations  thereof shall  be  prosecuted  in  the  County \nCourt. \nPlaintiffs'  Efforts to  Obtain a Permit to  Demonstrate in  a Parade and \nRally at the Miami-Dade College Commencement Event: \n15.  Various groups in the social justice and peace movements learned in March \n2007 that President George W.  Bush was tentatively scheduled to give a commencement \naddress on April 28th at Miami-Dade College.  Initial inquiries to the county police relating \nto the possible need for a permit to demonstrate during the President's visit were made on or \nabout April 1, 2007, by Ray Del Papa of Plaintiff SFPJN [Belgrave Decl. at •rr 8].  Mr. Del \nPapa was directed to the Special Events Department. \n16.  On April 2nd, event organizer Linda Belgrave (ofMFP and SFP.JN) contacted \nthe  Miami-Dade Police  Department  (\"M-D  PD\"),  and  was  contacted  on  April  4th  with \ndirection to contact Capt. Michael Mouring of the Kendall district station of the M-D PD. \n[Belgrave Decl. at  9-1 0]. \n~~ \n17.  A tentative meeting to resolve demonstration issues was set for April 6t\\ but \nthis meeting was cancelled by the M-D PD.  [Belgrave Decl. at~~ 10-11]. \n8 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 1      Entered on FLSD Docket 04/24/2007     Page 9 of 41\n18.  On April 14th Linda Belgrave ofMFP received an e-mail from Capt. Mouring \nindicating that the M-D PD would not accommodate a \"march route\" for the demonstration \nplanned on April 28th.  [Belgrave Decl. at~ 13].  No reason for the arbitrary rejection was \nprovided by the M-D PD.  !d. \n19.  As to the request for a location for a rally, Ms. Belgrave was advised that the \nM-D PD was not willing to meet to discuss a demonstration location until the week of April \n23rct.  [Belgrave Decl. at ~13]. \n20.  On  April  16th,  Ms.  Belgrave received  numerous  inquires  by  organizations \nseeking infom1ation about the RBA demonstration, particularly the march route.  [Belgrave \nDecl. at ~14]. \n21.  On April 17th and 18th,  upon request by the plaintiffs, legal counsel attempted \nto resolve outstanding issues arising from the RBA political march and rally with Miami \nDade County, to no avail [Declaration of Mara Shlackman, dated April 21, 2007, hereinafter \n\"Shlackman Decl.,\" at ~~ 3 to 6]. \n22.  The refusal by  the M-D PD to  accommodate the RBA's proposed political \nparade route, and the failure of the M-D PD to provide a location for the post-parade rally, \n9 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 1      Entered on FLSD Docket 04/24/2007     Page 10 of 41\nhave caused legitimate fear among the Plaintiffs that the M-D PD may endeavor to shut \ndown  any  rally  on  April  28th  through  enforcement  of its  quarter-century  old  loitering \nordinance.  [Del Papa Decl. at ,-r 6]. \n23.  In light of the MDPD'S denial of a lane closure for the political parade in which \nPlaintiffs plan to participate, the hundreds of participants, including Plaintiffs' members, would be \nforced to crowd onto the sidewalks, and would risk arrest for hindering or impeding the passage of \npedestrians.  [Del Papa Decl. at ~6].  Additionally, Plaintiffs are aware that the loitering ordinance \ncarries  maximum penalties of a $500.00  fine  and/or sixty  (60)  days  in jail, which  are  serious \npenalties that are likely to discourage participation in the march given the denial of lane closures to \nfacilitate the march.  !d.  The County's parade permit ordinance and its loitering ordinance infringe \non Plaintiffs' First Amendment right to peaceably assemble, and to be visible on the street to their \nintended  audience  while  exercising  their  First  Amendment  freedoms  of speech,  assembly  and \npetition. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \n24.  As to each cause of action delineated below in Counts One through Three:, plaintiffs \nadvance their federal constitutional claims against the governmental entities as state actors, \nthrough the operation of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n10 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 1      Entered on FLSD Docket 04/24/2007     Page 11 of 41\nCOUNT ONE \nMonell Claim - Official Policy to Suppress Protected Speech and Assembly \n(42 USC§ 1983  -Violation of First Amendment- Various Grounds) \nCounty Code § 30-27 4 - Parades & Processions Ordinam:e \nBy ALL PLAINTIFFS Against MIAMI-DADE COUNTY \n25.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate each jurisdictional and factual allegation of \nParagraphs 1-24, as if set forth at length herein. \n26.  At all times relevant hereto, the Miami-Dade County Board of County \nCommissioners (\"M-D BCC\") was the final policymaker of Miami-Dade County (\"M-DC\") \nfor purposes of adopting ordinances and other policies formally regulating eonstitutionally \nprotected expression and assembly within the county's boundaries. \n27.  In December, 1971, the M-D BCC enacted Ordinance No. 71-94, now codified at \nCounty Code§ 30-274 (not revised since March, 1973), precluding any \"procession or \nparade\" in the unincorporated areas of Miami-Dade County, except in accordance with a \npermit issued by the Sheriff.  This Parades & Processions Ordinance is unconstitutional on \nits face as an impermissible prior restraint, containing terms which provide unfettered \ndiscretion to law enforcement officials, lack of deadlines for considering applications, lack \nof appropriate review for unfavorable decisions, and other deficiencies. \n28.  County Code§ 30-274 was used as the basis for defendant M-DC's refusal to issue a \npermit for the plaintiffs' planned political march on April28, 2007. \n11 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 1      Entered on FLSD Docket 04/24/2007     Page 12 of 41\n29.  The adoption by the M-D BCC of Code§ 30-274, and the implementation ofthis \nParades and Processions Ordinance by the M-DPD, is the proximate cause: of the \ndeprivation of the First Amendment rights of Plaintiffs and other demonstrators for the \nplanned activities on April28, 2007, on public streets, sidewalks and other public property \nadjacent to M-D College.  Plaintiffs seek redress for this violation of the First Amendment \nthrough the op~~ration of 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \nCOUNT  TWO \nMonell Claim - Official Policy to Suppress Protected Speech and Assembly \n(42 USC§ 1983  -Violation of First Amendment- Overbreadth) \nCounty Code§ 21-31.1- Loitering Ordinance \nBy ALL PLAINTIFFS Against MIAMI-DADE COUNTY \nand MIAMI-DADE COLLEGE \n30.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate each jurisdictional and factual allegation of \nParagraphs 1-24, as if set forth at length herein. \n31.  At all times relevant hereto, the M-D BCC was the final policymaker of Miami-Dade \nCounty for purposes of adopting ordinances and other policies formally regulating conduct \nin public, including constitutionally-protected expression and assembly within the county's \nboundaries. \n32.  In March, 1967, the M-D BCC enacted Ordinance No. 67-17, now codiHed at \nCounty Code § 21-31.1.  The  Loitering Ordinance provides that it is unlawful to engage in \n\"standing\" or \"remaining'' on any public street, sidewalk or \"place\" so as to hinder or \nimpede vehicular or pedestrian traffic, see M-D County Code§ 21-31.1 (b) (1):; it is also \n12 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 1      Entered on FLSD Docket 04/24/2007     Page 13 of 41\nunlawful to \"loiter in or about a ... college or university campus so as to hinder or impede \nthe orderly conduct of instructional, recreational or other school activities,\" see M-D \nCounty Code § 21-31.1 (b)( 4 ).  These sections are applicable in the incorporated and \nunincorporated areas ofMiami-Dade County, see M-D County Code§ 21-31.1 (c). \n33.  This Loitering Ordinance is unconstitutional on its face as an impennissibly \noverbroad prohibition that has a substantial impact on conduct protected by the: First \nAmendment, including the expressive conduct which the plaintiffs in this action plan for the \npublic street and sidewalks adjacent to M-D College. \n34.  The anticipated use of County Code§ 21-31.1 by the M-DPD and M·-D College \ncampus police have chilled the First Amendment-protected activities of the plaintiffs, and \nmay cause the arrest of members ofthe plaintiffs, as well as others similarly situated who \nwish to exercise their rights of free speech, assembly and association on April 28, 2007. \n35.  The adoption by the M-D BCC of Code§ 21-31.1, and the anticipated \nimplementation of this Loitering Ordinance by the M-DPD and/or the M-D College \ncampus police are the proximate causes of the deprivation of the First Amendment rights of \nPlaintiffs, and other demonstrators similarly situated, with respect to the planned activities \non April28, 2007 on public streets, sidewalks and other public property adjacent to M-D \nCollege.  Plaintiffs seek redress for this violation of the First Amendment through the \noperation of42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n13 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 1      Entered on FLSD Docket 04/24/2007     Page 14 of 41\nCOUNT  THREE \nMonell Claim - Official Policy to Suppress Protected Speech and Assembly \n(42 USC§ 1983  -Violation of 14th Amendment- Vagueness and Liberty Interest) \nCounty Code§ 21-31.1- Loitering Ordinance \nBy ALL PLAINTIFFS Against MIAMI-DADE COUNTY \nand MIAMI-DADE COLLEGE \n36.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate each jurisdictional and factual allegation of \nParagraphs 1-24, as if set forth at length herein. \n37.  At all times relevant hereto, the M-D BCC was the final policymaker of Miami-Dade \nCounty for purposes of adopting ordinances and other policies formally regulating conduct \nin public, including constitutionally-protected expression and assembly within the county's \nboundaries. \n38.  In March, 1967, the M-D BCC enacted Ordinance No. 67-17, now codified at \nCounty Code § 21-31.1.  The  Loitering Ordinance provides that it is unlawful to engage in \n\"standing\" or \"remaining\" on any public street, sidewalk or \"place\" so as to hinder or \nimpede vehicular or pedestrian traffic, see M-D County Code§ 21-31.1 (b) (1); it is also \nunlawful to \"loiter in or about a ... college or university campus so as to hinder or impede \nthe orderly conduct of instructional, recreational or other school activities,\" see M-D \nCounty Code§ 21-31.1 (b)(4).  These sections are applicable in the incorporated and \nunincorporated areas ofMiami-Dade County, see M-D County Code§ 21-31.1 (c). \n39.  This Loitering Ordinance is unconstitutional on its face, as an impermissibly vague \nprohibition that has a substantial impact on conduct protected by the Due Process Clause of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment, for two reasons.  First, this ordinance fails to provide the kind \n14 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 1      Entered on FLSD Docket 04/24/2007     Page 15 of 41\nof notice that enables ordinary citizens to understand what precise conduct it prohibits; \nsecond, it authorizes arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement through its lack of precision. \n40.  This Loitering Ordinance is further unconstitutional on its face as an impermissible \nprohibition on conduct that is protected by the liberty interest arising from the Due Process \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The members of the plaintiff organizations have a \nsignificant liberty interest in standing on public sidewalks and public places according to \ntheir inclination. \n41.  The anticipated use of County Code§ 21-31.1 by the M-DPD and M·-D College \ncampus police have chilled the First Amendment-protected activities of the plaintiffs, and \nmay cause the arrest of members of the plaintiffs, as well as others similarly situated who \nwish to exercise their rights of free speech, assembly and association on April28, 2007. \n42.  The adoption by the M-D BCC of Code § 21-31.1, and the anticipated \nimplementation of this Loitering Ordinance by the M-DPD and/or the M-D College \ncampus police in a manner disallowed by the 14th Amendment, is the proximate cause of the \ndeprivation of the First Amendment rights of Plaintiffs without due process, and other \ndemonstrators similarly situated, on April28, 2007, with respect to the planned activities on \npublic streets, sidewalks and other public property adjacent to M-D College ..

I have personal knowledge of the facts set forth in this declaration. \n2.  I am a resident of the unincorporated area of Miami-Dade County known as Kendall, \nthe secretary of Miami for Peace, Inc. (\"MFP\"), and one of the principal organizers for Reject the \nBush Agenda  (\"RBA\"),  a  coalition  of activist  groups  plcmning protest  activities  relating to  the \ncommencement address that President Bush is scheduled to give at Miami-Dade College (\"MDC\") on \nApril 28, 2007.  MFP is a participating group in the RBA coalition.  MFP is also a partjcipant in the \nSouth Florida Peace and Justice Network (\"SFPJN\"), a tri-county network of groups dedicated to \nissues of peace and social justice, which is also a Plaintiff in this case. \n3.  MFP is a Florida non-profit corporation that has been registered with the State of \nFlorida since 2003.  The group's goals arc to end the Iraq War, and to promote peace generally. \n-1-\n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 1      Entered on FLSD Docket 04/24/2007     Page 19 of 41\nToward these ends, MFP and its members participate in protests, do educational work such as teach \nins, and participate in letter writing campaigns. \n1.  Among the activities MFP has participated in are protests in the tri-county area in \nMarch 2006 to commemorate the third anniversary of the Iraq War; an Iraq War protest in Doral, \nMiami-Dade County, Florida, in March 2007 to commemorate the fourth anniversary of the Iraq \nWar;  a protest in .January 2007 to advocate shutting down the Guantanamo facilities where alleged \nterrorism suspects are being held; an event in February 2007 in downtown Mian1i to support freedom \nof speech; and a monthly protest against the Iraq War, along US 1 in Miami during the evening rush \nhour. \n5.  MFP initiated the planning of the April 28, 2007 protest with the goals of demanding \nthe immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq, and the restoration of civil liberties and freedom \nof speech in the United States.  A website for the protest is located at  \"\"'\"w.rejectbushmi<uni.com. \nMFP plans to hold a march between 3 p.m. and 1 p.m.  The proposed march route is a half-mile \nlong, startingjust south of the east entrance to the MDC Kendall can1pus at SW 100\" Street and SW \n107'h Avenue.  The march will proceed south on SW 107\"' Avenue, and tum the comer to proceed \nwest on SW 104\"' Street, stoppingjust before the main entrance to the MDC Kendall campus at SW \n10 1.\"' Street and SW 10 9\"' Court.  A map of the route is attached as Exhibit A.  The march will not \nblock the entrances to the campus.  Our t,>roup's goal is to communicate our message to people \nentering the campus to attend the commencement, to passersby on the roadways, and to the general \npublic through the media.  Our intended audience is the larger community, rather than the college \ncommunity, and we do not wish to interfere with the commencement itself. \n6.  Because hundreds of people are expected to attend tins march, ti1e sidewalks will be \ninsufficient to accommodate ti1e march, and I have requested in writing that the police issue a pcnnit \n-2-\n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 1      Entered on FLSD Docket 04/24/2007     Page 20 of 41\nfor a parade and/or procession and close ofriancs of traffic to facilitate our march.  A parade and/or \nprocession with closed traffic lanes will protect the safety of participants in the march.  There arc 2 \nnorthbound lanes and 2 southbound lanes with no median on SW 10 7 .. Avenue, while SVV 10 4\"' Street \nhas 3 eastbound lanes and 3 westbound lanes, separated by a median.  Given the number oflancs on \nthese thoroughfares, the brevity of the march, and the fact that the cmmnencemcnt ceremonies do not \nbegin until 5 p.m., we believe that our request for partial lane closure could be accomplished by \nclosing off a single lane on SW 107\"' Avenue and a single lane on SW 104. . Street, wi1hout interfering \nwith traffic safety in any way. \n7.  At the conclusion of the march, it is planned that march participants will hold a rally \nadjacent to the main entrance to the MDC Kendall can1pus located at SW 10 1. .. Street and SW 10 9\"' \nCourt, and the rally will continue from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. \n8.  To initiate the process of seeking a pcnnit from the Mian1i-Dade Police Department \n(\"MDPD\")  to hold the march and rally, on April1, 2007, my fdlow organizer, Ray Del Papa, called \nthe Miami-Dade Police Department's non-emergency number, to ask who to call to coordinate a \nprotest when President Bush is in town. Mr. Del Papa was t,riven another number, for Special Events. \n9.  On the morning of April 2,  2007, I called the MDPD Special Events telephone \nnumber, where I was put through to Lt. Del Menendez's number. There was no answer, so I left a \nmessage, telling him we wanted to hold a demonstration while President Bush is at Miami Dade \nCollege, and I was calling to get the process started. With no response by late afternoon, I called at,>ain, \nleaving another message. \n10.  On April1, 2007, Lt. Menendez left me a message to call Captain Michael C. Mouring, \nof the Kendall police station, saying he had also provided my contact infonnation to the Captain. On \nthe same day, I called and spoke to Captain Mouring.  He seemed accommodating (although he did \n-3-\n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 1      Entered on FLSD Docket 04/24/2007     Page 21 of 41\ntry to steer us toward holding the demonstration on campus, despite our desire to be out ;md \\~sible to \nthe public), and we set a meeting for Friday, April6, 2007, at 10:30 a.m. Captain Mom·ing said that he \nwould check with his colleague in the MDPD legal department (regarding scheduling), and would \nconfinn the meeting by April 5th. Captain Mouring indicated that he did not anticipate a problem. \n11.  Captain Mouring had not called to confinn the April 6th appointment by  mid-day on \nApril 5th,  so I called him and left a message with my office  phone number and a request for \nconfinnation of the following day's appointment. I did not receive a call-back by late afternoon on \nApril 5th, so I called awain, and Captain Mouring answered and told me that the following day was \n\"premature\" for a meeting; we would have to postpone.  I discussed with Captain Mouring the size of \nthe demonstration; I gave a very rough estimate of a few  hundred, but with caveats,  since it is \nimpossible to predict turnout.  I did not try to set a  new meeting date and time during that call, \nbecause Captain Mouring said he was going to be out of the office the following Monday & Tuesday, \nand I was going; to be out of town the rest of that week, and I wanted to confer with others before \ntaking the next step. \n12.  On April 6, 2007, I sent Captain Mouring an e-mail describing in detail the RBA ad-\nhoc committee's plans for our demonstration (e-mail is attached hereto as Exhibit B). I requested that \nwe reschedule our cancelled meeting for Monday, April 16, 2007.  In the e-mail, I requested that \nCaptain Mouring call my cell phone to respond, as I would be out of town and off-line. I also \nsuggested that Captain Mouring respond to my e-mail using the \"reply all\" function, so that Ms. Mara \nShlackman, our counsel, as well as  Mr. Del Papa, could handle any matters  that arose during my \nabsence. I received no phone call  from Captain Mouring while I was out of town. \n13.  On April 14, 2007, I returned home in the evening, and discovered that Captain \nMouring had responded to my e-mail the previous afternoon, April 13m (e-mail from Captain Mouring \n-4-\n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 1      Entered on FLSD Docket 04/24/2007     Page 22 of 41\nattached as Exhibit C).  In his e-mail, Captain Mouring stated that a meeting would still be \"premature\" \nand that he would contact me the week of April 23\"'  to schedule a meeting, which is the same week \nthe demonstration is scheduled to take place.  In this e-mail Captain Mouring also rejected a critical \naspect of our planned event, stating that he was \"not willing\" to close traffic lanes. No reason was \nprovided.  Because of the manner in which Captain Mouring responded to my April 6'h e-mail, there \nwas a delay in my receipt of notice of Captain Mouring's refusal to schedule a timely appointment \nreg-arding planning for the demonstration and his refusal to grant our request for lane closures. \n14.  On April  16, 2007, I  received numerous phone calls from people who want to \nparticipate in the demonstration. The most common questions concerned the starting point for the \nmarch and other inquiries relating to the march. Because Captain Mouring has continuallly declined to \nmeet with us, this has been a diflicult question to answer. \n15.  My counsel have advised me that Mian1i-Dade County has a very minimal ordinance \nscheme, that gives unfettered discretion to the MDPD in deciding whether to grant a pennit for a \npolitical procession or parade.  The County Code provides no criteria the MDPD must follow in \ndeciding whether to grant or deny a parade pennit, provides no time fran1es for the processing of \npennit requesl'i, and provides our group with no avenue of administrative appeal now that our request \nfor a safe parade route has been denied.  The manner in which Captain Mouring: has treated my \nrequest for lane closures is  a  direct result of this  insufficient ordinance scheme.  The First \nAmendment rights ofMFP have been violated, in that Captain Mouring's refusal to meet with me and \nto grant lane closures has already hindered MFP'S efforts in organizing this protest, since uncertainty \nover the details of the demonstration discourages participation.  Moreover, if we are unable to \nproceed with  the demonstration on March 28,  MFP'S First Amendment rights will  be further \ninfringed. \n-5-\n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 1      Entered on FLSD Docket 04/24/2007     Page 23 of 41\nPursuanl to 28 U .S.C. § 17 46, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and \ncorrect. \n~ \nl'l \nExecuted on this  day of April, 2007. \n-~a~~~ \nUNDA BELGRAVE \n-6-\n\nGoogle Maps  Page 1 of2 \nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 1      Entered on FLSD Docket 04/24/2007     Page 24 of 41\nMiami-Dade' \nCommunity,· \nCollege•: \" \n'd-'' \nm \ni \n~, \n0  rn \n5'  -g  f:i;J:  \n\" \n~ \n~ :!l:r·~BI1~,  ~  0-5<   \n:0 \n\"'  ~J \nSW 103rd_ ~~ \n(.@ \n)(  SW 1tl41t1St \n-~ \n·~ \n0 \nsw >09th s1  sw ,0'? . \n0 \nSW 11111~ S!  -\nSW 1!1\\~St \nSW 112111 St ---,  I \nsw 1 nm l.~l-!·.· . . _i   sw 1nm St \ner \nhttp://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&msa=O&hl=en&msid= 102343697412620805...  4/19/2007 \n\nGoogle Maps  Page 2 of2 \nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 1      Entered on FLSD Docket 04/24/2007     Page 25 of 41\nReject Bush Miatmi \nGeorge W.

That \nway, when we sit down together, we can all be on the same page. \nORGANIZATION: Reject Bush Agenda \n(This is the name we've given to our ad-hoc organizing committee. It consists of a number of local organizations, \nincluding the South Florida Peace & Justice Network & Miami for Peace, the hats you currently know me by.) \nDATE & TIME: April ~~8. 3:00p.m. to 7:00p.m. \n(As we continue to firm up our plans, we anticipate narrowing this window somewhat.) \nDEOMONSTRATION PLAN & PLACE: March & rally/picket outside Miami Dade College, Kendall Campus. We \nplan to gather at the MDC driveway that intersects S.W. 10 7th Ave. We will march from that location, south to \nS.W. 1 04th St., then west on 10 4th to the MDC main entrance. At that point, we plan to spread out along S.W. \n104th St. and rally/picket for the duration. \nSOUND: We have not made plans regarding sound yet, but at a minimum, we will probably use a battery \noperated megaphone. \nSIZE: As you and I discussed, this is very hard to predict. At this point, we anticipate a few hundred people. \nPROTEST REQUEST: We are requesting lane closures on S.W. 107th Ave. & S.W. 104th ST., as needed. \nMEETING REQUEST: Ms. Mara Shlackman and I would like to reschedule the Friday, April 6th meeting that you \nfelt was premature, to Monday April16, after 10:00 a.m. \nI realize that your \"out of office\" schedule and mine will make communication somewhat awkvvard this coming \nweek. If you have any questions, and/or to respond regarding our meeting, it is probably best to call me on me \ncell, which I'll have out of town. That number is 305-801-0245. You can also hit \"reply all\" to respond to this \nmessage. I don't anticipate having e-mail access while I'm away, but the others will receive your note and I can \nsee it when I return. \nMeanwhile, I hope you have a good weekend and time away. \nThank you, \nLinda Belgrave \nReject Bush Agenda \nSouth Florida Peace llo.

I have personal knowledge of the facts set forth in this declaration. \n2.  I am a resident of an unincorporated area of northeast Miami-Dade County, \nFlorida, a director of Haiti Solidarity, Inc. (\"HS\"), and an organizer for Reject the Bush \nAgenda (\"RBA\"), a coalition of activist groups planning protest activities relating to the \ncommencemE~nt address that President Bush is scheduled to give at Miami-Dade College \n(\"MDC\")  on  April  28,  2007.  I  have  attended  several  organizing  meetings  for this \ndemonstration during the past month.  HS is a participating group in the RB.A coalition.  HS \nis also a participant in the South Florida Peace and Justice Network (\"SFPJN\"), a tri-county \n-1-\n\n-\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 1      Entered on FLSD Docket 04/24/2007     Page 29 of 41\nnetwork of groups dedicated to issues of peace and social justice, which is also a Plaintiff \nin this case. \n3.  HS is a Florida non-profit corporation that has been registered with the State \nof Florida since 2004.  HS' purpose is to raise awareness in the United States regarding \nissues of democracy and human rights in Haiti, by participating in various educational and \nprotest activities. \n4.  Among the activities HS has participated in are a mass rally of a 1,000 people within \nthe past month in front of the Immigration building at the comer of NE 79th Street and Biscayne \nBoulevard, to protest discrimination against Haitians who recently came ashore at Hallandale Beach, \nBroward  County,  Florida;  various  immigrants'  rights  demonstrations  during  2006,  some in \ndowntown Miami and others at the Immigration building on NE 79th  Street; and a march of \napproximately 6,000 people in downtown Miami to urge that the Haitian government free Father \nGerard Jean-Juste, which took place approximately a year and a half ago. \n5.  HS' purpose in participating in the demonstration against the Bush Administration on \nApril28, 2007, adjacent to the Kendall campus ofMiami-Dade College, is to demand that Haitian \nrefugees in the United States be granted Temporary Protected Status under U.S. immigration law. \nOur group's goal is to communicate our message to people entering the campus to attend \nthe commenc~3ment, to passersby on the roadways, and to the general public through the \nmedia.  Our intended audience is the larger community, rather than the college community, \nand we do not wish to interfere with the commencement itself. \n6.  HS plans to bring in buses of people from the Little Haiti section of the CityofMiami \nto attend this d(;:monstration.  HS anticipates that approximately 200 Haitians will attend this event, \n-2-\n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 1      Entered on FLSD Docket 04/24/2007     Page 30 of 41\naside from from any other groups that will be attending this protest. \n7.  My counsel have advised me that Miami-Dade County has a w~ry minimal \nordinance  scheme, that gives unfettered discretion to the Miami-Dade Police Department \n(\"MDPD\") in deciding whether to grant a permit for a political procession or parade.  The \nCounty Code provides no criteria the MDPD must follow in deciding whether to grant or \ndeny a parade permit, provides no time frames for the processing of permit requests, and \nprovides no avenue of administrative appeal  now that a safe parade rout~3 has been \ndenied. \n8.  The South Florida Haitian community is upset about the denial of a safe parade route, \nas it infringes on their First Amendment right to peaceably assemble, and to be visiblt:: on the street \nto their intended audience while exercising their First Amendment freedom of speech.  Moreover, \nthe MDPD's n:fusal to provide a safe parade route, which is a direct result of this insufficient \nordinance scheme, very much concerns Haitian refugees, who do not want to be in d~mger of arrest \nor other negative encounters with law enforcement personnel.  The MDPD's restrictions on the \nHaitian refuget::s' exercise of democratic freedoms will have a chilling effect on their participation in \nthe march and rally, as an arrest could result in loss of permanent resident status and/or deportation \nback to Haiti.  For the size of the crowd anticipated, lane closures are necessary to 1ensure a safe, \npeaceful march, free of tension for participants and others.  Moreover, if the Haitian community \nin  South  Florida  is  unable  to  proceed  with  the  demonstration  on  April  28,  its  First \nAmendment rights will be further infringed. \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the~ foregoing is \ntrue and corn3ct. \n-3-\n\n·--\n------------·----  ,_ \nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 1      Entered on FLSD Docket 04/24/2007     Page 31 of 41\nk  A--,_--_ \n26~ay \nExecuted on thI.S  - of April, 2007. \nI \nJACK LIEBERMAN \n-4-\n\n-\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 1      Entered on FLSD Docket 04/24/2007     Page 32 of 41\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA \nMIAMI DIVISION \nCase No. \nMIAMI FOR PEACE, INC., SOUTH \nFLORIDA PEACE AND JUSTICE \nNETWORK, and HAITI SOLIDARITY, INC., \nPlaintiffs, \nv. \nMIAMI-DADE COUNTY, a political subdivision \nof the State of Florida, and THE DISTRICT \nBOARD OF TRUSTEES OF MIAMI-DADE \nCOLLEGE, \nDefendants. \nDECLARATION OF RAYMOND DEL PAPA \nRAYMOND DEL PAPA,  being of full  age,  hereby declares the following  under \npenalty of perjury: \n1.  I have personal knowledge of the facts set forth in this declaration. \n2.  I am a resident of the City of Fort Lauderdale, Broward County, Florida, a \nmember of the  steering  committee of the  South  Florida  Peace  and  Justiice  Network \n(\"SFPJN\"), and an organizer for Reject the Bush Agenda (\"RBA\"), a coalition of activist \ngroups planning protest activities relating to the commencement address that President \nBush is scheduled to give at Miami-Dade College (\"MDC\") on April 28,  2007.  I have \nattended  several  organizing  meetings  for this  demonstration  during  the  past  month. \nSFPJN is a participating group in the RBA coalition.  SFPJN is a tri-county (Miami-Dade, \n-1-\n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 1      Entered on FLSD Docket 04/24/2007     Page 33 of 41\nBroward, and Palm Beach Counties) unincorporated network of groups dedicated to issues \nof peace and social justice.  Among the groups that are part of the SFPJN are the other \ntwo Plaintiffs in this litigation, Miami for Peace, Inc. and Haiti Solidarity, Inc.  Other groups \nthat participate in the SFPJN include Code Pink, the Raging Grannies, and the Bolivarian \nYouth. \n3.  Among the activities that SFP JN has participated in or organized during the past year \nor so are a march and rally in Fort Lauderdale in March 2006 to commemorate the third anniversary \nof the Iraq War, which involved temporary lane closures along State Road 84, a major east-west \nartery in Fort Lauderdale; attendance at rallies and demonstrations in support of striking janitors at \nthe University of Miami and janitors at Nova Southeastern University fired for unionizing efforts; a \ndemonstration to support the campaign of the Coalition oflmmokalee Workers to convince Burger \nKing to  assure that tomato pickers are paid more; activities in  support of Umoja Village, an \nencampment in the Liberty City area of Miami for people lacking housing. \n4.  SFP JN is participating in the demonstration against the Bush Administration on April \n28, 2007, adjacent to the Kendall campus of Miami-Dade College, to demand immediate withdrawal \nof U.S. troops from Iraq, restoration of civil liberties, and Temporary Protected Status under U.S. \nimmigration law for Haitian refugees, all causes supported by member groups.  Our group's goal is \nto  communicate  our  message  to  people  entering  the  campus  to  attend  the \ncommencement, to passersby on the roadways, and to the general public through the \nmedia. Our intended audience is the larger community, rather than the college community, \nand we do not wish to interfere with the commencement itself. \n5.  My counsel have advised me that Miami-Dade County has a very minimal \n-2-\n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 1      Entered on FLSD Doc·k-et 04/24/2007     Page 34 of 41\nordinance scheme, that gives unfettered discretion to the Miami-Dade Police Department \n(\"MDPD\") in deciding whether to grant a permit for a political procession or parade.  The \nCounty Code provides no criteria the MDPD must follow in deciding whether to grant or \ndeny a parade permit, provides no time frames for the processing of permit requests, and \nprovides no  avenue of administrative appeal  now that a safe parade routH  has been \ndenied. \n6.  My counsel has also advised me that Miami-Dade County has an unconstitutionally \nvague ordinanc1~ concerning loitering, which penalizes loitering on public streets, public sidewalks, \nand near college campuses, among other places.  In light of the MD PD 'S denial of a lane closure for \nthe political parade in which SFP JN plans to participate, the hundreds of participants, including \nSFPJN members, would be forced to crowd onto the sidewalks, and would risk arrest for hindering \nor impeding the passage of other pedestrians. Additionally, my counsel has advised that the loitering \nordinance carries maximum penalties of a $500.00 fine and/or sixty (60) days in jail, which are \nserious penalti{:s that are likely to discourage participation in the march given the denial of lane \nclosures to facilitate the march.  The County's parade permit ordinance and its loitering ordinance \ninfringe on our group's First Amendment right to peaceably assemble, and to be visibl,e on the street \nto our intended audience while exercising our First Amendment freedom of speech.  Moreover, the \nMDPD's refusal to provide a safe parade route is a direct result of this insufficient ordinance \nscheme. \n-3-\n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 1      Entered on FLSD Docket 04/24/2007     Page 35 of 41\n,_.,. \nLikewise, if SFPJN members are unable to proceed with the demonstration on April 28, \ntheir First \nAmendment rights will be further infringed. \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is \ntrue and corred. \nAfl, \nI \nExecuted on this _oW_ day of April, 2007. \nD DEL PAPA \n-4-\n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 1      Entered on FLSD Doc-ket 04/24/2007     Page 36 of 41\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA \nMIAMI DMSION \nCase No.----------\nMIAMI FOR PEACE, INC., SOUTH FLORIDA \nPEACE AND JUSTICE NETWO~ and \nHAITI SOLIDARITY, INC., \nPlaintiffs, \nv. \nMIAMI-DADE COUNTY, a political subdivision of \nthe State ofFlorida, and THE DISTRICT BOARD \nOF TRUSTEES OF MIAMI-DADE COLLEGE, \nDefendants. \nDECLARATION OF MARA SHLACKMAN \nMARA SHLACKMAN, being of full age, hereby declares the following under penalty of \nperjury: \n1.  I have personal knowledge of the facts set forth in this declaration. \n2.  I have been a member of the Florida Bar in good standing since 1993, and I am also \nadmitted to practice in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, as well as the U.S. District \nCourts for the:  Southern and Middle Districts of Florida.  I reside and practice law in Fort \nLauderdale, Broward County, Florida.  I am one of the counsel representing the Plaintiffs in this \naction. \n3.  The Plaintiffs contacted me for assistance in the early part of the week of April 16, \n2007, with regard to negotiating on their behalft o obtain the necessary permits and/or approvals from \n-1-\n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 1      Entered on FLSD Docket 04/24/2007     Page 37 of 41\n-· \nthe Miami-Dad1e Police Department (\"MDPD\") to hold a demonstration on April28, 2007, adjacent \nto the Kendall c:ampus ofMiam.i-Dade College (\"MDC\"), coinciding with President Bush's delivery \nof the commencement address to graduating students.  The Plaintiffs called me afte:r receiving a \nrejection ofa  key element oftheir planned protest by Miami-Dade Police Department offitcials, namely \ntheir request for lane closures to facilitate a half-mile march commencing just past tht~ intersection \nofSW 100th Street and SW 10~ Avenue (the east entrance to the campus), and concluding at the \nintersection of SW 10 4th Street and SW 10 9th Court (the main entrance to the campus). \n4.  On Tuesday, Aprill7, 2007, I called Captain Michael C. Mouring, the same official \nthat Plaintiffs themselves had previously communicated with, and left a message reque:sting that he \ncall me regarding issues pertaining to the planned demonstration.  At 5:36 p.m. the same day, \nCaptain Mouring left a detailed voice mail message for me, in which he indicated that he could not \nconfirm a definite location where Plaintiffs could hold their demonstration.  Captain Mouring also \nstated that MDC had not yet decided whether to allow the activist groups on campus in \"First \nAmendment zones,\" but he would prefer that MDC do so, because otherwise ife veryom~ were on the \nsidewalk, that could become \"hectic\" and \"dangerous\". Furthermore, without giving any explanation, \nCaptain Mouring stated he was not inclined to close traffic Janes for the demonstration and did not \nplan to do so. \n5.  During the late morning and early afternoon ofWednesday, April IS, 2007, I spoke \ntwice with Assistant Miami-Dade County Attorney Jeffrey Ehrlich, who handles Federal litigation for \nthe County.  Mr. Ehrlich advised me that someone from the MDPD legal staff would contact me to \naddress permits and/or approvals for the march and rally planned by the Plaintiffs. \n6.  Shortly after 3 p.m. on Wednesday, April 18, 2007, I spoke with Robert Diers, an \n-2-\n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 1      Entered on FLSD Docket 04/24/2007     Page 38 of 41\nattorney with the MDPD who had left me a message earlier in the afternoon that day advising that \nhe was the \"informal First Amendment person\" for the MDPD, and that he was involved in everything \nrelated to President Bush's upcoming visit.  Mr. Diers indicated that unless a demonstrating group \nhas a history of violence, such as the Ku Klux Klan, the MDPD does not mandate First Amendment \nzones, and protjesting groups are allowed to use the sidewalks.  However, Mr. Diers also stated that \ntraffic lanes would not be shut down for this demonstration. \n7.  On the evening ofA  pril 18th, after concluding that all efforts to negotiate in good faith \nwith the MDPD had failed, the Plaintiffs authorized the undersigned counsel and co-counsel, Robert \nW. Ross, Jr., to proceed to prepare for filing suit in this matter. \nPursuant to 28 U.S. C. § 17 46, I declare under penalty ofp erjury that the foregoing is true and \ncorrect. \n'}J'v.. \n4 \nExecuted on this  day of April, 2007. \nMARASHLACKMAN \n-3-\n\n--------·· \nARTICLE I.

Specifically,  Plaintiffs, Miami for Peace \n(“MFP”), South Florida Peace & Justice Network (SFP&JN”), and Haiti Solidarity \n(“HS”) challenge § 30-274 of the M-D County Code, the Parades and Processions \nOrdinance that effectively regulates core political expression in traditional public \nfora, and Code § 21-31.1(b), Miami-Dade County’s Loitering Ordinance. \n  Plaintiffs assert that M-D County Code’s Parades & Processions Ordinance \nviolates the First Amendment in numerous respects.  First the challenged code \nsection regulating parades is an unlawful prior restraint as it requires permission \nfrom the sheriff for any “parade” or “procession” in Miami-Dade County, but \ncontains no standards for obtaining permission.  The M-D County Code does not \ncontain a procedural process for filing a permit, sets no time framework by \nwhich a decision to grant or deny the requested permit must be made, and sets no \nstandards for making the decision.  In short, the M-D County Code is overbroad, \nvague and lacks any standards or guidelines to check the unbridled discretion of \nMiami-Dade County (“County”) officials to use content-based factors to decide \nwho may or may not “speak” in the public fora.  This law is presumptively \nunconstitutional, as are all prior restraints, and fails the test applied to reasonable \ntime, place or manner regulations. \n  In addition, Miami-Dade County’s Loitering Ordinance is violative of First \nAmendment free speech guarantees insofar as it is vague and overbroad, thereby \n  2 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 61      Entered on FLSD Docket 03/18/2008     Page 3 of 22\ninfringing upon expressive conduct in public fora, and it also transgresses \nFourteenth Amendment due process rights because it criminalizes innocent \nconduct that is constitutionally protected as a recognized liberty interest . \n \n \nFACTUAL  BACKGROUND \n  The factual information relevant to this application are set forth in Plaintiffs’ \nConcise Statement of Material Facts in Support of Motion for Partial Summary \nJudgment, dated March 17, 2008, and filed this date in support of Plaintiffs’ \nMotion for Final Partial Summary Judgment \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  3 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 61      Entered on FLSD Docket 03/18/2008     Page 4 of 22\n \nLEGAL  ARGUMENT \n \nPOINT  1  -  THE PLAINTIFFS ARE ENTITLED TO A DECLARATION \nTHAT THE PARADES & PROCESSIONS ORDINANCE IS AN \nUNLAWFUL PRIOR RETRAINT THAT VIOLATES THE FIRST \nAMENDMENT \n \n  The Plaintiffs asserted in Count One of the Second Amended Complaint that \nMiami-Dade County Code § 30-274, its Parades & Processions Ordinance, is \nclearly violative of the First Amendment insofar as it constitutes an unlawful prior \nrestraint due to its lack of basic procedural safeguards, because it vests unbridled \ndiscretion in public officials, and finally because Code § 30-274 is not a reasonable \nTime, Place or Manner regulation. \n \nA. Miami-Dade County’s Permit Scheme Constitutes an Unlawful Prior \nRestraint Insofar as the Ordinance Lacks Adequate Procedural Safeguards. \n \n  Code § 30-274, by its specific terms, mandates that no social or political \nprocession or parade “shall occupy, march or proceed along any street or roadway \nexcept in accordance with a permit issued by the Sheriff.”  This Code section was \nspecifically relied upon by Miami-Dade County in refusing to issue a permit for \nthe “Reject the Bush Agenda” March and Rally planned for April 28, 2007. \nThe permit scheme embodied by M-D County Code § 30-274 is a classic \nprior  restraint  on  constitutionally-protected  expression.    “A  prior  restraint  on \nexpression exists when the government can deny access to a forum for expression \nbefore the expression occurs.” United States v.Frandsen, 212 F.3d 1231, 1236-37 \n  4 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 61      Entered on FLSD Docket 03/18/2008     Page 5 of 22\n(11th Cir. 2000); Cooper v. Dillon, 403 F.3d 1208, 1215 (11th Cir. 2005).  As the \nCooper tribunal noted, “[b]ecause statutes silencing speech before it happens are \ninimical to the tenets of  free expression underlying a free society, these statutes \nare  characterized  as  prior  restraints  on  speech  and  are  subjected  to  strict \nscrutiny.”  Cooper, 403 F.3d at 1214-15 (bold emphasis added); Burk v. Augusta-\nRichmond County, 365 F.3d 1247, 1251 (11th Cir. 2004). \nTherefore, the provision in M-D County Code § 30-274 that requires prior \napproval by the Sheriff, before a politically-oriented march can occur on a public \nstreet, clearly places a prior restraint on free speech.  There is a strong presumption \nagainst the constitutionality of prior restraints on free speech.  Bourgeois v. Peters, \n387 F.3d 1303, 1319 (11th Cir. 2004).  This is because a “[p]rior restraint upon \nspeech  suppresses  the  precise  freedom  which  the  First  Amendment  sought  to \nprotect against abridgment.” Carroll v. Pres. & Commissioners of Princess Anne, \n393 U.S. 175, 181 (1968).  Ordinances that place a prior restraint on speech by \nrequiring “before-the-fact permitting and licensing schemes” to the point that they \ncreate  “an  impermissible  risk  of  suppression  of  ideas”  will  be  found  to  be \nunconstitutionally overbroad.  Forsyth County v.  Nationalist Movement, 505 U.S. \n123, 129 (1992). \nA prior restraint must contain basic procedural safeguards to ensure that \nprotected expression is not inhibited.  At a minimum, it must allow for prompt \njudicial review in the event the permit is denied or unduly burdened.  Freedman v. \nMaryland,  380  U.S.  51,  58-59  (1965).        “Meaningful  judicial  review  is  the \ntouchstone of the [prior restraint] test.  ‘Prompt judicial review must be available \nto correct erroneous denials of access to expression.’”  Bourgeois, 387 F.3d at \n1319-20.  Because the challenged ordinance lacks any time for deciding a permit \napplication, the County’s Code misses the mark completely.  See Redner v. Dean, \n29 F.3d 1495, 1502 (11th Cir. 1994) (“[the] ordinance [is]. . . inadequate under any \n  5 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 61      Entered on FLSD Docket 03/18/2008     Page 6 of 22\ninterpretation of ‘prompt judicial review’ because it creates the risk that expressive \nactivity  could  be  suppressed  indefinitely  prior  to  any  judicial  review  of  the \ndecision to deny a license”). \n \nB. Miami-Dade County’s Permit Scheme Constitutes an Unlawful Prior \nRestraint Since the Ordinance Vests Unbridled Discretion in Public Officials. \n \n  By its express terms, M-D County Code § 30-274 requires persons interested \nin planning a parade or procession to obtain a permit from the “Sheriff.”  However, \nthe Code does not indicate how one must apply for a permit, how long the process \nwill take, what factors constitute the basis for approval or denial of a permit, or \nwhat administrative remedies are available upon the denial of a permit request.  In \nsum,  the Code is totally bereft of meaningful guidelines. \nIt  is  black  letter  law  that  any  attempt  to  subject  “the  exercise  of  First \nAmendment freedoms to the prior restraint of a license, without narrow, objective, \nand  definite  standards  to  guide  the  licensing  authority  is  unconstitutional.”  \nShuttlesworth  v.  City  of  Birmingham,  394  U.S.  147,  150-51  (1969).    See  also \nForsyth County, 505 U.S. at 132-33.  A law regulating speech in public fora fails if \nit “delegate[s] overly broad licensing discretion” to officials.  Id. at 130.    \n“It  is  settled  .  .  .  that  an  ordinance  which  .  .  .  makes  peaceful \nenjoyment of freedoms which the Constitution guarantees contingent \nupon the uncontrolled will of an official—as by requiring a permit or \nlicense which may be granted or withheld in the discretion of such \nofficial—is an unconstitutional censorship or prior restraint upon the \nenjoyment of those freedoms.”   \nShuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham, 394 U.S. 147, 149–51 (1969) quoting Staub \nv. Baxley, 355 U.S. 313, 322 (1957). (emphasis added).   \n  6 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 61      Entered on FLSD Docket 03/18/2008     Page 7 of 22\nWhen there are no clear standards upon which an official can make these \ndecisions, or standards can be applied differently to different types of gatherings, \nan ordinance will not be upheld.  See Bourgeois, 387 F.3d at 1317 (holding a \nrestriction is invalid when no standards appear anywhere, no limitations are listed, \nand there is “no circumscribing of the absolute power” of the decision-maker).  \n“To curtail that risk, a law subjecting the exercise of First Amendment freedoms to \nthe  prior  restraint  of  a  license  must  contain  narrow,  objective,  and  definite \nstandards to guide the licensing authority.”  Forsyth County, 505 U.S. at 130-31.     \nStandards provide the guideposts that check the licensor and allow \ncourts quickly and easily to determine whether the licensor is \ndiscriminating against disfavored speech.  Without these guideposts, \npost hoc rationalizations by the licensing official and the use of \nshifting or illegitimate criteria are far too easy, making it difficult for \ncourts to determine whether the licensor is permitting favorable, and \nsuppressing unfavorable expression.  \n \nCity of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Pub. Co., 486 U.S. 750, 758 (1988).1  The \nM-D County Code lacks the narrow and specific guidelines needed to check \nofficial discretion.  Thus, it is not “narrowly drawn” in a manner sufficient to \npass the First Amendment’s dictates.    \nIt matters not if M-D County may never have applied the Code in a content-\nbased manner.  A facial challenge to a permit scheme that “delegates overly broad \ndiscretion  to  the  decision-maker  rests  not  on  whether  the  administrator  has \nexercised his discretion in a content-based manner, but whether there is anything in \nthe ordinance preventing him from doing so.”  Forsyth, 505 U.S. at 133, 133 n.10; \naccord,  City  of  Lakewood,  486  U.S.  at  757  (“mere  existence  of  licensor’s \n                                                 \n     1  Even content-neutral time, place and manner rules require adequate standards to guide the \ndecisionmaker’s determination.  Thomas v. Chicago Park District, 534 U.S. 316, 323 (2002). \n \n  7 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 61      Entered on FLSD Docket 03/18/2008     Page 8 of 22\nunfettered discretion, coupled with the power of prior restraint, intimidates parties \ninto  censoring  their  own  speech,  even  if  the  discretion  and  power  are  never \nactually abused”). “The First Amendment does not permit the government to place \nburdens  on  speech  and  assembly  in  .  .  .  an  unprincipled,  ad  hoc  manner[,]”  \nBourgeois, 387 F.3d at 1318, and neither this Court nor the public can “depend on \nthe individuals responsible for enforcing [a regulation] to do so in a manner that \ncures [the law] of constitutional infirmities[.]” Frandsen, 212 F.3d at 1240. \nMiami-Dade  County  Code  §  30-274  requires  permission  issued  by  the \nsheriff for any “procession or parade,” but contains absolutely no time for filing or \ntime by which a permit would be decided.  For nearly four decades, the United \nStates  Supreme  Court  has  condemned  similar  laws  imposing  lengthy  advance \nfiling requirements.  “[T]iming is of the essence in politics . . . and when an event \noccurs, it is often necessary to have one’s voice heard promptly, if it is to be \nconsidered at all.”  Shuttlesworth, 394 U.S. at 163.  Here, County officials are \nunconstrained, by any textual limits in the Code, from holding a permit request \nuntil the last moment, only then to deny it for unspecified reasons, leaving no \nopportunity to seek prompt judicial review of the denial of a permit.  \nThe  fatal  lack  of  a  time  by  which  to  decide  a  permit  application  is \ncompounded here because the Code is devoid of standards on other key provisions.  \nM-D County Code § 30-274 requires permission of the sheriff to “parade,” but \ndoes not state how permission is obtained.   “Excessive discretion over permitting \ndecisions  is  constitutionally  suspect  because  it  creates  the  opportunity  for \nundetectable censorship and signals a lack of narrow tailoring.”  Burk  v. Augusta \nRichmond County, 365 F.3d 1247, 1256 (11th Cir. 2004). Because M-D  County’s \nCode embodies “[e]xcessive discretion over permitting decision” it fails this key \ntest of constitutional adequacy. \n \n  8 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 61      Entered on FLSD Docket 03/18/2008     Page 9 of 22\n \n \nC.  Miami-Dade  County’s  Permit  Scheme  Constitutes  an  Unlawful  Prior \nRestraint Because the Ordinance is Not a Reasonable Time, Place or Manner \nRegulation. \n \n  County Code § 30-274 exempts only federal and state military forces, \nmembers of police and fire departments, and persons participating in funerals from \nthe requirement of obtaining permission from “the Sheriff” before participating in \na procession or parade on the public streets and roadways of Miami-Dade County. \n \nThe County regulates core expressive activity in virtually all public fora.  “In \nsuch  places,  which  occupy  a  ‘special  position  in  terms  of  First  Amendment \nprotection,’  the  government’s  ability  to  restrict  expressive  activity  ‘is  very \nlimited.’”    Boos  v.  Barry,  485  U.S.  312,  318  (1988)  quoting  United  States  v. \nGrace, 461 U.S. 171, 177, 180 (1983).   Time, place, and manner restrictions in \ntraditional public fora are constitutional as long as they are content-neutral,2 are \nnarrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest, and leave open ample \nalternative  channels  to  communicate  the  message.    Clark  v.  Community  for \nCreative Non-Violence, 468 U.S. 288, 293 (1984).  The failure to meet any prong \nis fatal to the entire law.  Perry Educ. Ass’n v. Perry Local Educators’ Ass’n, 406 \nU.S. 36, 45 (1983) (emphasis added).  The City’s scheme violates all three prongs. \n  First, Miami-Dade County Code Section 30-274 is not a content-neutral \nregulation.   To pass constitutional muster, a time, place or manner regulation of \n                                                 \n2 A content-based restriction is subject to the more stringent requirement that it be “necessary to serve a \ncompelling state interest,” and be “narrowly drawn to achieve that end.”    Boos, 485 U.S. at 321.   \nHowever, it is not necessary to examine whether Section 30-274 of the Miami-Dade County Code meets \nthis more stringent test, because as shown herein, it cannot even satisfy the less exacting standard for \ncontent-neutral time, place, and manner restrictions. \n  9 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 61      Entered on FLSD Docket 03/18/2008     Page 10 of 22\nspeech in a traditional public forum must be content-neutral.  Clark v. Community \nfor  Creative  Non-Violence,    468  U.S.  at  293.    If  the  decision  involves  the \n“appraisal of facts, the exercise of judgment, and the formation of an opinion,” it is \ncontent-based and the “the danger of censorship and of abridgment of our precious \nFirst Amendment freedoms is too great to be permitted.”  Forsyth, 505 U.S. at 131 \n[internal citations omitted].  The County’s Code contains no standards for deciding \npermits.    Officials  may  decide  based  on  the  content  of  the  speech  and,  for \ndisfavored speakers, delay or deny the permit, or impose onerous conditions.  For \nthese reasons, M-D County Code § 30-274 is not content-neutral. \n  Second, even assuming content-neutrality, the County cannot meet its \nburden to prove that the  permit scheme is  narrowly-tailored.   While “[t]he \nState . . . has a strong interest in ensuring the public safety and order, in promoting \nthe free flow of traffic on public streets and sidewalks . . . ,” Madsen v. Women’s \nHealth Ctr., 512 U.S. 753, 768 (1994), at the same time, when First Amendment \nrights are  at issue,  the government has  the burden of showing  that  the law is \nnarrowly tailored and that there is evidence supporting its proffered justification. In \nthis regard, it is important to underscore that “[courts] have never accepted mere \nconjecture  as  adequate  to  carry  a  First  Amendment  burden.\"  Nixon  v.  Shrink \nMissouri Government PAC, 528 U.S. 377, 392 (2000).  See also Turner Broadcast \nSystem, Inc. v. F.C.C., 512 U.S. 622, 644 (1994) (“When the government defends a \nregulation  on  speech  as  a  means  to  redress  past  harms  or  prevent  anticipated \nharms,  it  must  do  more  than  simply  posit  the  existence  of  the  disease  to  be \ncured.”).    To  prove  narrowly  tailoring,  the  County  must  show  actual,  not \nspeculative harm, and that the disputed laws actually address that harm.  Id. \nEven a content-neutral law is not narrowly-tailored “[w]here the licensing \nofficial enjoys unduly broad discretion . . . to grant or deny a permit, [as] there is a \nrisk that he will favor or disfavor speech based on its content.” Thomas, 534 U.S. \n  10 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 61      Entered on FLSD Docket 03/18/2008     Page 11 of 22\nat 323, citing Forsyth County, 505 U.S. at 131. “A government regulation that \nallows arbitrary application is ‘inherently inconsistent with a valid time, place and \nmanner regulation because such discretion has the potential for becoming a means \nof  suppressing  a  particular  point  of  view.’”  Forsyth  County,  505  U.S.  at  132 \n(citation omitted).    \nThe  Supreme  Court  “requires  that  a  time,  place  and  manner  regulation \ncontain adequate standards to guide the official’s decision and render it subject to \neffective judicial review.”  Thomas v. Chicago Park District, 534 U.S. 316, 323 \n(2002), citing Niemotko v. Maryland, 340 U.S. 268 (1951).  The ordinance in \nThomas  included  express  bounds  on  the  bases  for  denying  a  permit,  required \nofficials to process applications within 28 days and explain in writing any denials. \nThomas, 534 U.S. at 32. These were held to be sufficiently specific and objective \nto  insulate  against  the  exercise  of  the  “whim  of  the  administrator.”  Id.,  citing \nForsyth County, 505 U.S. at 133.  “They provide ‘narrowly drawn, reasonable and \ndefinite  standards’  to  guide  the  licensor’s  determination.  .  .  .    And  they  are \nenforceable on review – first by appeal to the General Superintendent of the Park \nDistrict,  . . .  and then by writ of common-law certiorari in the Illinois courts[.]”  \nThomas, 534 U.S. at 32.  By way of contrast, in the instant case Defendant Miami-\nDade’s Code lacks any standards and any opportunity for review. \nAbsent the safeguards present in Thomas, the County’s permit scheme is \nunconstitutional.    See  also  City  of  Lakewood,  486  U.S.  at  769-70  (discretion \nimpermissibly  unfettered  where  official  may  impose  “such  other  terms  and \nconditions  deemed  necessary”);  Shuttlesworth,  394  U.S.  at  156-58  (unbridled \ndiscretion in regulation permitting decisions to grant or deny  parade permit on \ngrounds of “the public welfare, peace, safety, health”).   Defendant’s Code sets no \ntime by which a permit request must be decided, enumerates no bases for granting \nor denying a request, and contains no standards for setting conditions on a permit.   \n  11 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 61      Entered on FLSD Docket 03/18/2008     Page 12 of 22\nSuch “[e]xcessive discretion over permitting decisions is constitutionally suspect \nbecause it creates the opportunity for undetectable censorship and signals a lack of \nnarrow tailoring.”  Burk, 365 F. 3d at 1256 (emphasis added).  \n  Third,  the  permit  scheme  fails  to  leave  open  ample  alternatives  for \ncommunication.  It is a cardinal rule of First Amendment law that “[the] streets \n[and sidewalks] are natural and proper places for the dissemination of information \nand opinion; and one is not to have the exercise of his liberty of expression in \nappropriate places abridged on the plea that it may be exercised in some other \nplace.”  Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U.S. 88, 105-106 (1940) [citations omitted].  \nThe  County’s  Code  does  not  allow  for  ample  alternatives  for  core  expression \nwithin the County.  If a permit for a parade or procession is not obtained, the group \nis thereby foreclosed from all public streets and highways in the County. Even the \nsidewalks are unavailable to Plaintiffs since they are potentially subject to arrest \nunder the Miami-Dade County Loitering Ordinance found at M-D County Code § \n21-31.1 (b). \n \nPOINT  2  -  THE PLAINTIFFS ARE ENTITLED TO A DECLARATION \nTHAT THE COUNTY’S LOITERING ORDINANCE IS AN OVERBROAD \nPROHIBITION THAT VIOLATES THE FIRST AMENDMENT \n \n  In Count Two of the Second Amended Complaint, the Plaintiffs assert that \nMiami-Dade County Code § 21-31.1 (b), the Loitering Ordinance, is \nunconstitutional on its face because it is impermissibly overbroad and thereby \ncapable of chilling the exercise of lawful First Amendment-protected core \nexpressive activities.    \n  12 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 61      Entered on FLSD Docket 03/18/2008     Page 13 of 22\nThe loitering provisions of § 21-31.1 (b) of the M-D County Code  make it \nunlawful to be on a public street, public sidewalk, public overpass, public bridge or \npublic place “to hinder or impede pedestrians or vehicles.”   \nThe overbreadth doctrine invalidates laws that inhibit the free exercise of \nFirst Amendment-protected activities.  City of Chicago v. Morales, 527 U.S. 41, 52 \n(1999).  Peaceful protest on public sidewalks is a quintessential First Amendment \nactivity.  See e.g., Perry, 460 U.S. at 45; Gregory v. City of Chicago, 394 U.S. 111, \n112  (1969).    The  City  may  not  “make  criminal  the  peaceful  expression  of \nunpopular views. . . . ‘unless shown likely to produce a clear and present danger of \na serious substantive evil that rises far above public inconvenience, annoyance, \nor unrest.’”  Terminiello v. Chicago, 347 U.S. 1, 4-5 (1949).    \nThe ability to restrict assemblies on sidewalks based on any conceivable \n“obstruction” is unlawful. In Cox v Louisiana, 379 U.S. 536 (1965), the Supreme \nCourt overturned the convictions of civil rights activists.  Two thousand students \nassembled peaceably at the state capitol building and marched to the courthouse, \nwhere fellow activists arrested earlier were being held.  With official permission, \nbut without a permit, they assembled on the sidewalk across the street from the \ncourthouse and, in a lawful manner, rallied and marched.  When they failed to \ndisperse pursuant to a police order indicating that they had exceeded their time for \ndemonstrating, they were arrested for obstructing a sidewalk.  \nAn ordinance is overbroad where every application creates an impermissible \nrisk  of  suppression  of  ideas,  such  as  when  an  ordinance  allows  unfettered \ndiscretion in one decision-maker or where the ordinance sweeps too broadly to \npenalize constitutionally-protected speech.  Forsyth County, 505 U.S. at 129-30.  \nThe Supreme Court has consistently held that ordinances are unconstitutionally \nbroad  under  the  circumstances  noted  in  Cox  and  Forsyth,  as  these  ordinances \nwould allow punishment for peaceful protest involving disfavored views.  The \n  13 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 61      Entered on FLSD Docket 03/18/2008     Page 14 of 22\nCourt also held that the conviction under a statute banning obstruction of public \nsidewalks was a clear violation of freedom of speech and assembly where the \n“obstruction” ordinance was coupled, as here, with the unfettered discretion of \nlocal officials to regulate the use of streets for peaceful parades and assemblies.  \nPrecedent requires that Miami-Dade County Code § 21-31.1(b) be invalidated by \nthis tribunal. \n \nPOINT  3  -  THE PLAINTIFFS ARE ENTITLED TO A DECLARATION \nTHAT THE COUNTY’S LOITERING ORDINANCE IS FACIALLY \nINVALID BECAUSE IT OFFENDS THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE OF THE \nFOURTEENTH AMENDMENT ON THE GROUNDS OF VAGUENESS \nAND VIOLATION OF A PROTECTED LIBERTY INTEREST \n \nIn Count Three of the Second Amended Complaint, the Plaintiffs assert that \nMiami-Dade County Code § 21-31.1 (b), the Loitering Ordinance, is \nunconstitutional on its face as being offensive to the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due \nProcess Clause, because: (1)  it is an impermissibly vague prohibition, in that it \nfails to provide notice as to precisely what conduct falls within its sweep, and it \nauthorizes arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement, and (2) it prohibits conduct \nthat is protected by the liberty interest of the Due Process Clause. \nVagueness  can  invalidate  a  criminal  law  because  either:  (1)  it  failed  to \nprovide the kind of notice that allows ordinary persons to understand what conduct \nis  prohibited,  or  (2)  it  authorizes  or  encourages  arbitrary  and  discriminatory \nenforcement.  City of Chicago v. Morales, 527 U.S. 41, 56 (1999).  M-D County’s \nLoitering  Ordinance  is  unconstitutionally  vague,  in  part  because  there  is \nuncertainty about what type of loitering would be considered criminal conduct, and \nwhich conduct would not fall within its sweep.  Id. at 57.  Courts have consistently \ninvalidated laws or ordinances that do not join the crime of loitering with a second \n  14 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 61      Entered on FLSD Docket 03/18/2008     Page 15 of 22\nspecific  element.    Id.  at  58.        Miami-Dade  County’s  Loitering  Ordinance  is \nunconstitutionally vague because it fails to alert the public as to what type of \nconduct is prohibited since M-D County could not “conceivably have meant to \ncriminalize each instance a citizen stands in public.”  See Id. at 57.  \n \nFreedom to loiter “for innocent purposes” is a liberty interest protected by \nthe  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment.    City  of  Chicago  v. \nMorales, 527 U.S. 41, 53 (1999).  The Supreme Court has held that a person’s \ndecision to remain in “a public place of his choice” or to move to another place \nupon his own inclination is “as much a part of . . . liberty as the freedom of \nmovement  inside  frontiers that is  ‘a  part  of our heritage.’”   Id.  citing  Kent  v. \nDulles,  357  U.S.  116,  126  (1958).    Miami-Dade  County  Code  §  21-31.1(b) \nunconstitutionally  restricts  the  liberty  interest  of  Plaintiffs  by  criminalizing \nstanding or remaining on public streets, sidewalks, overpasses, bridges, and places.  \nPlaintiffs have a constitutional right to stand or remain on a public place if their \nconduct  does  not  completely  obstruct  a  sidewalk,  or  if  their  presence  is  not \ninjurious or threatening.  Miami-Dade County’s Loitering Ordinance violates this \ncritically important due process right guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, \nand is invalid. \n \nPOINT  4  -  THE PLAINTIFFS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THEIR \nENTITLEMENT TO FINAL PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AS TO \nTHEIR CLAIMS FOR BOTH DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE \nRELIEF \n \nA.   Standard Governing Motions for Partial Summary Judgment. \nAny party to an action can move for a motion for summary on all or part of any \n  15 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 61      Entered on FLSD Docket 03/18/2008     Page 16 of 22\nclaim.  Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 56 (c).   Further, “[a] summary judgment, interlocutory in \ncharacter, may be issued on the issue of liability alone although there is a genuine \nissue as to the amount of damages.”   Id.   Summary judgment is proper when, \nviewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, there exists no genuine \nissue of material fact.  D Beach, 486 F.3d  (11th Cir. 2007). \n \nB.  The Plaintiffs are Entitled to a Declaratory Judgment as to Counts One, \nTwo and Three of the Second Amended Complaint. \n \nAny Court of the United States may declare the rights of any interested party \nseeking  such  a  declaration,  and  it  shall  have  the  force  and  effect  of  a  final \njudgment.  28 U.S.C. §2201.  Federal courts have jurisdictional authority to issue \ndeclaratory  judgment  and  injunctive  relief  prohibiting  the  enforcement  of  an \nordinance or statute when the ordinance or statute’s application is unconstitutional.  \nSee Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood, 546 U.S. 320, 331 (2006); Beaulieu v. City of \nAlabaster,  454  F.3d  1219  (11th  Cir.  2006)  (affirming  the  District  Court’s \ndeclaratory judgment against the City holding that their sign ordinance violated the \nFirst Amendment). \nPlaintiffs are entitled to declaratory judgment under 28 U.S.C. §2201 because \nMiami-Dade County’s Parade & Procession Ordinance is violative of the First \nAmendment, and because the Loitering Ordinance violates both the First \nAmendment and the Fourteenth Amendment, as delineated with specificity \nhereinabove. \n \nC.  The Plaintiffs are Entitled to a Permanent Injunction as to Counts One, \nTwo and Three of the Second Amended Complaint. \n \nA permanent injunction is proper if a plaintiff establishes four elements: 1) actual \n  16 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 61      Entered on FLSD Docket 03/18/2008     Page 17 of 22\nsuccess on the merits; 2) the likelihood of irreparable injury unless the injunction \nissues; 3) the threatened injury to the movant outweighs the damage caused to the  \nCounty; and, 4) the injunction would not be adverse to the public interest.  KH \nOutdoor, LLC v. City of Trussville, 458 F.3d 1261,  1268 (11th Cir. 2006).  \nPlaintiffs readily meet each part of this test. \n  Plaintiffs assert that they meet the “actual success” prong of the permanent \ninjunction test based on the arguments delineated in Points One through Three, \nsupra. \nAs to the issue of irreparable injury, it has been specifically noted by the \nEleventh Circuit Court of Appeals that the loss of First Amendment freedoms \nunquestionably  constitutes  irreparable  injury.      KH  Outdoor,  LLC  v.  City  of \nTrussville, 458 F.3d 1261, 1272 (11th Cir. 2006), quoting Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. \n347, 373 (1976) (emphasis added).  The Eleventh Circuit has held that there is a \nfinding  of  irreparable  harm  when  First  Amendment  rights  are  violated  on  an \nongoing basis because the plaintiffs cannot be made whole by money damages \nwhen their free speech is chilled.  KH Outdoor, LLC, 458 F.3d at 1272, citing \nNortheastern Fla. Chapter of the Ass’n of Gen. Contractors of America v. City of \nJacksonville, 896 F.2d 1283, 1285 (11th Cir. 1990).  As noted above, Miami-Dade \nCounty Code § 30-274 constitutes an impermissible prior restraint on free speech, \nand the Loitering Ordinance, M-D County Code § 21-31.1 (b) is overbroad, and \naccordingly,  both  code  sections  infringe  upon  First  Amendment-protected  core \nexpressive  conduct.    Additionally,  the  County’s  continued  enforcement  of  the \nLoitering Ordinance, with its abrogation of due process rights guaranteed by the \nFourteenth Amendment, is similarly an injury that is irreparable in nature to those \nsubjected to the loss of their freedom by the enforcement of the ordinance. \n  17 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 61      Entered on FLSD Docket 03/18/2008     Page 18 of 22\nAs to the balance of hardships, Plaintiffs assert that the injury to them and \nto others similarly situated in South Florida is that rights protected by the First and \nFourteenth  Amendments    will  be  abrogated  by  the  two  M-D  Code  sections \nrequiring  advance  permitting  and  unbridled  discretionary  authority  to  public \nofficials. Such an egregious violation of civil rights poses a grave hardship to \nPlaintiffs when seeking to convey their political and social justice messages.  The \nDefendant  is  not  similarly  harmed.  Miami-Dade  County  may  need  to  add \nadditional law enforcement officers to enhance security, but such a hardship is no \ngreater than any other increase in security a municipality would face when large \nnumbers of people gather together, such as at a music concert or sporting event.  \nDefendants are still free to maintain the peace by enforcing existing criminal laws \nto keep the area secure.  The granting of injunctive relief to Plaintiffs will not alter \nthis prerogative.  As a result, when balancing the hardships, it is clear that the \ngreater  injury  is  to  the  Plaintiffs  who  are  faced  with  restrictions  on  First \nAmendment-protected activity and the loss of Fourteenth Amendment due process \nrights. \n  The  Plaintiffs  assert  that  the  granting  of  their  request  for  a  Permanent \nInjunction as to both Code § 30-274 and Code § 21-31.1 (b) is in the public \ninterest in the case sub judice.    “[T]he public interest is always served when \nconstitutional  rights,  especially  free  speech  rights,  are  vindicated.”    University \nBooks & Videos, Inc. v. Metropolitan Dade County, 33 F. Supp.2d 1364, 1374 \n(S.D. Fla. 1999).  “The public has no interest in enforcing an unconstitutional \nordinance.”    KH  Outdoor,  LLC  v.  City  of  Trussville,  458  F.3d  at  1272.  \nFurthermore, it is not in the public interest to support a governmental entity’s \nexpenditure  of  time,  effort  and  money  in  order  to  enforce  an  unconstitutional \nordinance.  Fla. Businessmen for Free Enter. v. City of Hollywood, 648 F.2d 956, \n  18 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 61      Entered on FLSD Docket 03/18/2008     Page 19 of 22\n959 (5th Cir. 1981).  The public interest is clearly in favor of Plaintiffs and, thus, \ninjunctive relief should be granted. \n \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nMiami-Dade County Code § 30-274 violates the First Amendment in several \nkey  respects.    The  Parades and  Processions  Ordinance    is  an  unlawful  prior \nrestraint.   The Code is overbroad, and lacks any standards or guidelines to check \nthe unbridled discretion of  County officials to use content-based factors to decide \nwho may or may not “speak” in public places.  The Loitering Ordinance, M-D \nCounty  Code  §  21.31.1(b),  is  unconstitutionally  vague,  overbroad  and  an \nabrogation of liberty interests, and thereby violates First Amendment free speech \nand  Fourteenth  Amendment  due  process  rights.    For  the  reasons  mentioned \nhereinabove,  the  enforcement  of  both  code  provisions  should  be  declared \nunconstitutional and that final summary judgment should be granted. \n \n \nDATED :  March 17, 2008       \n \ns/Robert W.

This Court has jurisdiction over \nPlaintiffs’ claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§1331 and 1343, and in accordance with the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§2201 and 2202.  \n \n2.

Miami-Dade  County  (hereinafter  “M-D  County”)  employs  a  permit \nscheme for expressive activity in public fora that is both an unlawful prior restraint and \nan  unreasonable  time,  place  and  manner  regulation.   Adopted  in  1973,  it  requires  a \n“permit issued by the Sheriff” for every “parade or procession.”   The ordinance is \nabsolutely devoid of any standards to guide the decision of whether and under what \nconditions a permit will issue, how long public officials are allowed to decide whether \nthey will issue a permit, and what conditions may be imposed on expressive activities.   \nThe absence of any standards in these key areas means that the ordinance vests public \nofficials with unbridled discretion and invites content-based decisions based on the nature \nof the speaker.  This is a forbidden basis on which to rest a permit scheme that requires a \nlicense to engage in protected speech; the standardless permit scheme violates Plaintiffs’ \nFirst Amendment rights by impermissibly limiting their rights to speech, association, \nassembly  and  petition.    For  these  reasons,  the  Defendant  must  be  enjoined  from \nprohibiting the lawful exercise of First Amendment-protected activity.   Further, the \nPlaintiffs seek a declaration that the county’s “loitering ordinance” is a violation of Due \n  2 \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA   Document 24   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/05/2007   Page 3 of 18\nProcess insofar as it is vague and an abrogation of protected liberty interests, and further \nseek injunctive relief precluding the enforcement of said ordinance by the Defendant. \n   \nPARTIES \n \nPlaintiffs : \n4.  Plaintiff  MIAMI  FOR  PEACE  (hereinafter  “MFP”)  is  a  not-for-profit \ncorporation located in Miami, Florida, incorporated in Florida since 2003.  Among the \nactivities MFP has participated in are protests in the tri-county area in March 2006 to \ncommemorate the third anniversary of the Iraq War; an Iraq War protest in Doral, Miami-\nDade County, Florida in March 2007 to commemorate the fourth anniversary of the Iraq \nWar; a protest in January 2007 to advocate shutting down the Guantanamo facilities \nwhere alleged terrorism suspects are being held; an event in February 2007 in downtown \nMiami to support freedom of speech; and a monthly protest against the Iraq War, along \nUS  1  in  Miami  during  the  evening  rush  hour.    Plaintiff  MFP  was  one  of  the  key \norganizing groups of the REJECT THE BUSH AGENDA events (hereinafter “RBA”), \nincluding the march and rally that occurred on the afternoon of April 28, 2007.  Members \nof MFP will be actively participating in the September 15th “End the War” March and \nRally in Miami-Dade County, and will be distributing flyers in Miami-Dade County and \nBroward County prior to the event to publicize its occurrence.  MFP expended time and \nmoney to organize its membership for the April 28th RBA demonstration event, but MFP \nwas impeded in its ability to organize and generate turnout by Defendant Miami-Dade \nCounty’s ordinances and actions, and suffered damages as a direct and proximate result \nof defendant’s policies and practices. \n \n5.  Plaintiff  SOUTH  FLORIDA  PEACE  &  JUSTICE  NETWORK \n(hereinafter “SFPJN”) is an unincorporated network of peace and social justice groups in \nthe  Miami-Dade/Broward/Palm  Beach  tri-county  region.    Among  the  activities  that \nSFPJN has participated in or organized, since early 2006, are: a march and rally in Fort \n  3 \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA   Document 24   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/05/2007   Page 4 of 18\nLauderdale in March 2006 to commemorate the third anniversary of the Iraq War, which \ninvolved temporary lane closures along State Road 84, a major east-west artery in Fort \nLauderdale; attendance at rallies and demonstrations in support of striking janitors at the \nUniversity of Miami and janitors at Nova Southeastern University fired for unionizing \nefforts in 2006; a demonstration to support the campaign of the Coalition of Immokalee \nWorkers to convince Burger King to assure that tomato pickers are paid a decent wage; \nactivities in support of the Umoja Village, an encampment in the Liberty City area of \nMiami for people lacking housing.  SFPJN was a participating entity in RBA, and many \nof its member organizations participated in the April 28th march and rally at Miami-Dade \nCollege.   Members of SFPJN will be actively participating in the September 15th “End \nthe War” March and Rally in Miami-Dade County, and will be distributing flyers in \nMiami-Dade County and Broward County prior to the event to publicize its occurrence.  \nSFPJN expended time and money to organize its membership for the April 28th RBA \ndemonstration event, but SFPJN was impeded in its ability to organize and generate \nturnout  by  Defendant  Miami-Dade  County’s  ordinances  and  actions,  and  suffered \ndamages as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s policies and practices. \n \n \n6.  Plaintiff  HAITI  SOLIDARITY  (hereinafter  “HS”)  is  a  not-for-profit \ncorporation located in Miami, Florida, having been incorporated since 2004 in the State \nof Florida.  Among the activities HS has participated in are a mass rally of 1,000 people \nwithin the past month in front of the Immigration building at the corner of  NE 79th Street \nand Biscayne Boulevard, to protest discrimination against Haitians who recently came \nashore at Hallandale Beach, Florida; various immigrants’ rights demonstrations during \n2006, some in downtown Miami and others at the Immigration building on NE 79th \nStreet; and a march of approximately 6,000 people in downtown Miami to urge that the \nHaitian government free Father Gerard Jean-Juste, which took place approximately a year \nand a half ago.   Plaintiff HS brought one of the largest contingents of demonstrators to \nthe April 28th demonstration at Miami-Dade College.   Members of HS will be actively \n  4 \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA   Document 24   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/05/2007   Page 5 of 18\nparticipating in the September 15th “End the War” March and Rally in Miami-Dade \nCounty, and will be distributing flyers in Miami-Dade County and Broward County prior \nto the event to publicize its occurrence.  HS expended time and money to organize its \nmembership for the April 28th RBA demonstration event, but HS was impeded in its \nability to organize and generate turnout by Defendant Miami-Dade County’s ordinances \nand  actions,  and  suffered  damages  as  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of  Defendant’s \npolicies and practices. \n \nDefendant : \n \n7.  Defendant  MIAMI-DADE  COUNTY  (hereinafter  “M-D  County”)  is  a \npolitical subdivision of the State of Florida, with the capacity to sue and be sued.  It is the \nlegal entity  responsible for the actions of the Miami-Dade  County  Board  of County \nCommissioners (hereinafter “M-D BCC”), including the County Code promulgated by \nthe  M-D  BCC,  as  well  as  the  actions  of  law  enforcement  officers  employed  in  the \nCounty.  M-D County controls and is responsible for the Miami-Dade Police Department \n(hereinafter “M-D PD”), including the actions taken by the Metropolitan Sheriff and law \nenforcement officers employed by the M-D PD. \n \n   \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS COMMON TO ALL COUNTS \n \nMiami-Dade County Code Provisions: \n8.  Miami-Dade County has an antiquated permit scheme for all parades in the \nunincorporated portions of the county, first adopted in 1971 and last revised in 1973.  \nProvisions  of  this  type  have  been  repeatedly  condemned  insofar  as  they  are  clearly \n  5 \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA   Document 24   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/05/2007   Page 6 of 18\nviolative  of  First  Amendment  protections  for  the  freedoms  of  speech,  assembly  and \npetition. \n \n9.  Miami-Dade Code § 30-274:  Parades and processions; permit required \nIn  the  unincorporated  areas,  no  procession  or  parade, \nexcepting  the forces  of United States Armed Services, the \nmilitary forces of the State, the forces of the police and fire \ndepartments, and funeral processions, shall occupy, march, or \nproceed along any street or roadway  except in accordance \nwith a permit issued by the Sheriff and such other regulations \nas are set forth herein which may apply. \n \n10.  Miami-Dade County has a code provision criminalizing the standing or \nremaining on any public sidewalk or public place so as to hinder or impede the passage \nof pedestrians or vehicles; this section was first adopted in 1967, and last revised in 1982.  \nThis criminalization of loitering contains no exception for First Amendment-protected \nactivity or for innocent conduct protected by federal jurisprudence. \n11.  Miami-Dade County Code § 21-31.1:  Disorderly Conduct, Loitering, \nPenalties. \n(b)  Loitering.  For the purpose of this section “loitering” \nmeans the act of standing, remaining or sleeping on, in or \nabout  any  public  street,  public  sidewalk,  public  overpass, \npublic  bridge,  public  library  or  other  place  specifically \nenumerated herein.  A person commits the offense of loitering \nwhen he knowingly: \n(1)  Loiters  on  any  public  street,  public  sidewalk, \npublic overpass, public bridge or public place so as to \nhinder  or  impede  the  passage  of  pedestrians  or \nvehicles. \n. . . \n  6 \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA   Document 24   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/05/2007   Page 7 of 18\n(4)  Loiters in or about a school, college or university \ncampus so as to hinder to impede the orderly conduct \nof instructional, recreational or other school activities. \n. . . \n(c)   Penalties for violation.  . . . Any person convicted of a \nviolation  of  any  other  subsection  of  this  section  shall  be \npunished by a fine of five hundred dollars ($500.00) or by \nimprisonment in the County Jail for a term not to exceed sixty \n(60)  days,  or  by  both  such  fine  and  imprisonment,  in  the \ndiscretion of the court.  This section is applicable in both the \nincorporated  and  unincorporated  areas  of  Miami-Dade \nCounty and all violations thereof shall be prosecuted in the \nCounty Court. \n \nPlaintiffs’ Past Efforts to Obtain Permit to Demonstrate in Parade & \nRally: \n     \n12.  Various groups in the social justice and peace movements learned in March \n2007 that President George W. Bush was scheduled to give a commencement address on \nApril 28th at Miami-Dade College.  Initial inquiries to the county police relating to the \npossible  need  for  a  permit  to  march,  rally  and  otherwise  demonstrate  during  the \nPresident’s visit were made on or about April 1, 2007, by Ray Del Papa of Plaintiff \nSFPJN.  A tentative meeting to resolve demonstration issues was set for April 6th, but this \nmeeting was cancelled by the Miami-Dade Police Department (“M-D PD”). \n \n13.  On April 14th Linda Belgrave of MFP received an e-mail from M-D PD \nindicating that M-D PD would not accommodate a “march route” for the demonstration \nplanned on April 28th.  No reason for the arbitrary rejection was provided by the M-D PD. \n \n  7 \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA   Document 24   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/05/2007   Page 8 of 18\n14.  As to the request for a location for a rally, Ms. Belgrave was advised that \nthe M-D PD was not willing to meet to discuss a demonstration location until just a few \ndays prior to the event date.  On April 16th, Ms. Belgrave received numerous inquires by \norganizations seeking information about the RBA demonstration, particularly the march \nroute.  Ms. Belgrave advised these organizations that county authorities had refused to \neither approve tentative plans or to meet to discuss critical issues.   \n \n15.  On April 17th and 18th, upon request by the Plaintiffs, legal counsel for \nPlaintiffs attempted to resolve outstanding issues arising from the RBA political march \nand rally with Miami-Dade County, to no avail. \n \n16.  The refusal by the M-D PD to accommodate the RBA’s proposed political \nparade route, and the failure of the M-D PD to provide a location for the post-parade \nrally, caused legitimate fear among the Plaintiffs that the M-D PD would endeavor to \nshut down any rally on April 28th through enforcement of its quarter-century old loitering \nordinance. \n \n17.  In light of the M-D PD’S denial of a lane closure for the political parade in \nwhich  Plaintiffs  planned  to  participate  on  April  28th,  the  hundreds  of  participants, \nincluding Plaintiffs’ members, were forced to crowd onto the sidewalks, and legitimately \nfeared  that  they  risked  arrest  for  hindering  or  impeding  the  passage  of  pedestrians.  \nAdditionally,  Plaintiffs  were  aware  that  the  loitering  ordinance  carried  maximum \n  8 \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA   Document 24   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/05/2007   Page 9 of 18\npenalties of a $500.00 fine and/or sixty (60) days in jail, which are serious penalties that \ndiscouraged participation in the march.  The County’s parade permit ordinance and its \nloitering  ordinance  infringed  upon  Plaintiffs’  First  Amendment  right  to  peaceably \nassemble, and to be visible on the street to their intended audience while exercising their \nFirst Amendment freedoms of speech, assembly and petition. \n \n18.   As a result of the impact of the Defendants’ parade permit scheme and overbroad \nloitering ordinance, the Plaintiffs were forced to seek judicial relief by way of the filing, \nin U.S. District Court, of a Verified Complaint, Emergency Motion for Preliminary \nInjunctive Relief, Memorandum of Law supporting said motion, and related papers.  As a \nresult of this civil action, Defendant Miami-Dade County finally acquiesced, and agreed \nto accommodate the Plaintiffs’ First-Amendment-protected activity. \n  \n September 15, 2007 Demonstration Event: \n19.   MFP, SFPJN, HS and other organizations are planning to hold a march and rally in \nMiami-Dade County on Bird Road (SW 42nd Street) between Noon and 2:00 p.m. on \nSeptember 15, 2007.  The proposed march route is about a half-mile long, starting just \nnorth of the Kendall Regional Medical Center, at Bird Road (SW 42nd Street) and SW \n119th Avenue, and proceeding westbound along Bird Road, stopping between SW 128th \nand SW 129th Avenues, at the Congressional Field Office of U.S. Representative Mario \nDiaz-Balart, located at 12851 SW 42nd Street.  The march will not block the entrances to \n  9 \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA   Document 24   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/05/2007   Page 10 of 18\nthe congressional office.    At the conclusion of the march, it is planned that the march \nparticipants will hold a rally in front of the Congressman’s office. \n \nCAUSES OF ACTION \n20.   As to each cause of action delineated below in Counts One through Three, Plaintiffs \nadvance  their  federal  constitutional  claims  against  the  governmental  entities  as  state \nactors, through the operation of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n \nCOUNT ONE \nMonell Claim - Official Policy to Suppress Protected Speech and Assembly \n(42 USC § 1983  – Violation of First Amendment - Various Grounds) \nCounty Code § 30-274 – Parades & Processions Ordinance \nBy ALL PLAINTIFFS Against MIAMI-DADE COUNTY \n \n21.  Plaintiffs  reallege  and  incorporate  each  jurisdictional  and  factual  allegation  of \nParagraphs 1-20, as if set forth at length herein.   \n \n22.  At  all  times  relevant  hereto,  the  Miami-Dade  County  Board  of  County \nCommissioners (“M-D BCC”) was the final policymaker of Miami-Dade County (“M-\nDC”)    for  purposes  of  adopting  ordinances  and  other  policies  formally  regulating \nconstitutionally-protected expression and assembly within the county’s boundaries. \n \n \n \n  10 \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA   Document 24   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/05/2007   Page 11 of 18\n23.  In December, 1971, the M-D BCC enacted Ordinance No. 71-94, now codified at \nCounty Code § 30-274 (not revised since March, 1973), precluding any “procession or \nparade” in the unincorporated areas of Miami-Dade County, except in accordance with a \npermit issued by the Sheriff.   This Parades & Processions Ordinance is unconstitutional \non its face as an impermissible prior restraint, containing terms which provide unfettered \ndiscretion to law enforcement officials, lack of deadlines for considering applications, \nlack of appropriate review for unfavorable decisions, and other deficiencies. \n \n24.  County Code § 30-274 was used as the basis for defendant M-DC’s refusal to \nissue a permit for the Plaintiffs’ political march on April 28, 2007, and it is reasonably \nanticipated by Plaintiffs that said ordinance will be used as the basis to delay or refuse the \nissuance of a permit for the Plaintiffs planned march and rally on September 15, 2007. \n \n25.  The adoption by the M-D BCC of Code § 30-274, and the implementation of this \nParades and Processions Ordinance by the M-D PD, were the proximate cause of the \ndeprivation of the First Amendment rights of Plaintiffs and other demonstrators for the \nplanned  activities  on  April  28,  2007,  on  public  streets,  sidewalks  and  other  public \nproperty  adjacent  to  M-D  College,  and  are  the  proximate  cause  of  the  “chilling,” \nincluding reluctance of some to participate, uncertainty and confusion, surrounding the \nPlaintiffs’  First  Amendment-protected  core  political  events  on  September  15,  2007.   \nPlaintiffs seek redress for this violation of the First Amendment through the operation of \n42 U.S.C. § 1983.  \n \n  11 \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA   Document 24   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/05/2007   Page 12 of 18\nCOUNT  TWO \nMonell Claim - Official Policy to Suppress Protected Speech and Assembly \n(42 USC § 1983  – Violation of First Amendment - Overbreadth) \nCounty Code § 21-31.1 – Loitering Ordinance \nBy ALL PLAINTIFFS Against MIAMI-DADE COUNTY \n \n26.  Plaintiffs  reallege  and  incorporate  each  jurisdictional  and  factual  allegation  of \nParagraphs 1-20, as if set forth at length herein.   \n \n27.  At all times relevant hereto, the M-D BCC was the final policymaker of Miami-\nDade County for purposes of adopting ordinances and other policies formally regulating \nconduct in public, including constitutionally-protected expression and assembly within \nthe county’s boundaries. \n \n28.  In March, 1967, the M-D BCC enacted Ordinance No. 67-17, now codified at \nCounty Code § 21-31.1.   The  Loitering Ordinance provides that it is unlawful to engage \nin “standing” or “remaining” on any public street, sidewalk or “place” so as to hinder or \nimpede vehicular or pedestrian traffic, see M-D County Code § 21-31.1 (b) (1).  This \nsection  is  applicable  in  the  incorporated  and  unincorporated  areas  of  Miami-Dade \nCounty.  See M-D County Code § 21-31.1 (c). \n \n29.  This  Loitering  Ordinance  is  unconstitutional  on  its  face  as  an  impermissibly \noverbroad prohibition, that has had, and will in the future have, a substantial impact on \nconduct protected by the First Amendment, including the expressive conduct of these \nPlaintiffs. \n \n \n  12 \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA   Document 24   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/05/2007   Page 13 of 18\n30.  The anticipated use of County Code § 21-31.1 by the M-D PD has chilled the First \nAmendment-protected activities of the Plaintiffs in the past, and may cause the arrest of \nmembers of the plaintiffs, as well as others similarly situated who wish to exercise their \nrights of free speech, assembly and association on September 15, 2007. \n \n31.  The adoption by the M-D BCC of Code § 21-31.1, and the implementation of this \nLoitering Ordinance by the M-DPD were the proximate cause of the deprivation of the \nFirst Amendment rights of Plaintiffs, and other demonstrators similarly situated, with \nrespect to the activities on April 28, 2007 on public streets, sidewalks and other public \nproperty  adjacent  to  M-D  College,  and  are  the  proximate  cause  of  the  “chilling,” \nincluding reluctance of some to participate, uncertainty and confusion, surrounding the \nPlaintiffs’  First  Amendment-protected  core  political  events  on  September  15,  2007.  \nPlaintiffs seek redress for this violation of the First Amendment through the operation of \n42 U.S.C. § 1983. \nCOUNT  THREE \nMonell Claim - Official Policy to Suppress Protected Speech and Assembly \n(42 USC § 1983  – Violation of 14th Amendment – Vagueness and Liberty Interest) \nCounty Code § 21-31.1 – Loitering Ordinance \nBy ALL PLAINTIFFS Against MIAMI-DADE COUNTY \n \n32.  Plaintiffs  reallege  and  incorporate  each  jurisdictional  and  factual  allegation  of \nParagraphs 1-20, as if set forth at length herein.   \n \n33.  At all times relevant hereto, the M-D BCC was the final policymaker of Miami-\nDade County for purposes of adopting ordinances and other policies formally regulating \nconduct in public, including constitutionally-protected expression and assembly within \nthe county’s boundaries. \n  13 \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA   Document 24   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/05/2007   Page 14 of 18\n \n34.  In March, 1967, the M-D BCC enacted Ordinance No. 67-17, now codified at \nCounty Code § 21-31.1.   The  Loitering Ordinance provides that it is unlawful to engage \nin “standing” or “remaining” on any public street, sidewalk or “place” so as to hinder or \nimpede vehicular or pedestrian traffic, see M-D County Code § 21-31.1 (b) (1).  This \nsection  is  applicable  in  the  incorporated  and  unincorporated  areas  of  Miami-Dade \nCounty, see M-D County Code § 21-31.1 (c). \n \n35.  This  Loitering  Ordinance  is  unconstitutional  on  its  face,  as  an impermissibly \nvague prohibition that has a substantial impact on conduct protected by the Due Process \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment, for two reasons.   First, this ordinance fails to \nprovide  the  kind  of  notice  that  enables  ordinary  citizens  to  understand  what  precise \nconduct  it  prohibits;  second,  it  authorizes  arbitrary  and  discriminatory  enforcement \nthrough its lack of precision. \n \n36.  This  Loitering  Ordinance  is  further  unconstitutional  on  its  face  as  an \nimpermissible prohibition on conduct that is protected by the liberty interest arising from \nthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.   The members of the plaintiff \norganizations  have  a  significant  liberty  interest  in  standing  on  public  sidewalks  and \npublic places according to their inclination. \n \n37.  The use of County Code § 21-31.1 by the M-D PD chilled the First Amendment-\nprotected  activities  of  the  Plaintiffs  on  April  28,  2007,  and  may  cause  the  arrest  of \nmembers of the Plaintiffs’ organizations, as well as others similarly situated who wish to \nexercise their rights of free speech, assembly and association, on September 15, 2007. \n \n \n  14 \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA   Document 24   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/05/2007   Page 15 of 18\n38.  The  adoption  by  the  M-D  BCC  of  Code  §  21-31.1,  and  the  past  and  future \nimplementation of this Loitering Ordinance by the M-D PD in a manner disallowed by \nthe  14th  Amendment,  are  the  proximate  cause  of  the  past  deprivation  of  the  First \nAmendment rights of Plaintiffs without due process, and other demonstrators similarly \nsituated,  on  April  28,  2007,  with  respect  to  the  planned  activities  on  public  streets, \nsidewalks and other public property adjacent to M-D College, and the proximate cause of \nthe “chilling,” including reluctance of some to participate, uncertainty and confusion, the \nPlaintiffs’  First  Amendment-protected  core  political  events  on  September  15,  2007.  \nPlaintiffs seek redress for this violation of the 14th Amendment through the operation of \n42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n \nPRAYER  FOR  RELIEF  -  ALL  COUNTS \n         \n  WHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  seek  judgment  against  Defendant  for  the  following \nrelief: \n1.  A preliminary and permanent injunction, enjoining Defendant, its officers, agents \nand employees from enforcing Miami-Dade County Code §§ 30-274 and 21-31.1(b); \n2.  For  a  declaration  that  Defendant  Miami-Dade  County’s  challenged  ordinances \nviolate  Plaintiffs’  rights  to  free  speech,  assembly,  association  and  to  petition  the \ngovernment for redress of grievances, under the First Amendment, and are a further \nviolation of due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution; \n3.   For compensatory damages, as permitted by law; \n4.   For costs of suit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1920 and 42 U.S.C. § 1988; \n5.   For attorneys’ fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988; \n6.

This  action  seeks  declaratory  relief,  injunctive  relief  and  compensatory \ndamages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1983, for ongoing and threatened injury to the First \nAmendment  and  Fourteenth  Amendment  rights  of  organizations  engaged  in  lawful \nexpressive activity within Miami-Dade County, Florida.  This Court has jurisdiction over \nPlaintiffs’ claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§1331 and 1343, and in accordance with the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§2201 and 2202.  \n \n2.  Venue is proper in the Southern District of Florida, Miami Division, under \n28 U.S.C. §1391(b).  All parties reside, in or are headquartered in the Southern District; \nthe  Defendant  is  located  in  the  Miami  Division,  and  all  of  the  acts  or  omissions \ncomplained of herein have occurred or will occur in the Miami Division. \n \n  INTRODUCTION \n3.  Miami-Dade  County  (hereinafter  “M-D  County”)  employs  a  permit \nscheme for expressive activity in public fora that is both an unlawful prior restraint and \nan  unreasonable  time,  place  and  manner  regulation.   Adopted  in  1973,  it  requires  a \n“permit issued by the Sheriff” for every “parade or procession.”   The ordinance is \nabsolutely devoid of any standards to guide the decision of whether and under what \nconditions a permit will issue, how long public officials are allowed to decide whether \nthey will issue a permit, and what conditions may be imposed on expressive activities.   \nThe absence of any standards in these key areas means that the ordinance vests public \nofficials with unbridled discretion and invites content-based decisions based on the nature \nof the speaker.  This is a forbidden basis on which to rest a permit scheme that requires a \nlicense to engage in protected speech; the standardless permit scheme violates Plaintiffs’ \nFirst Amendment rights by impermissibly limiting their rights to speech, association, \nassembly  and  petition.    For  these  reasons,  the  Defendant  must  be  enjoined  from \nprohibiting the lawful exercise of First Amendment-protected activity.   Further, the \nPlaintiffs seek a declaration that the county’s “loitering ordinance” is a violation of Due \n  2 \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA   Document 43   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/14/2007   Page 3 of 19\nProcess insofar as it is vague and an abrogation of protected liberty interests, and further \nseek injunctive relief precluding the enforcement of said ordinance by the Defendant. \n   \nPARTIES \n \nPlaintiffs : \n4.  Plaintiff  MIAMI  FOR  PEACE  (hereinafter  “MFP”)  is  a  not-for-profit \ncorporation located in Miami, Florida, incorporated in Florida since 2003.  Among the \nactivities MFP has participated in are protests in the tri-county area in March 2006 to \ncommemorate the third anniversary of the Iraq War; an Iraq War protest in Doral, Miami-\nDade County, Florida in March 2007 to commemorate the fourth anniversary of the Iraq \nWar; a protest in January 2007 to advocate shutting down the Guantanamo facilities \nwhere alleged terrorism suspects are being held; an event in February 2007 in downtown \nMiami to support freedom of speech; and a monthly protest against the Iraq War, along \nUS  1  in  Miami  during  the  evening  rush  hour.    Plaintiff  MFP  was  one  of  the  key \norganizing groups of the REJECT THE BUSH AGENDA events (hereinafter “RBA”), \nincluding the sidewalk march and rally that occurred on the afternoon of April 28, 2007, \nand  the  September  15th  “End  the  War”  Sidewalk  March  and  Rally  in  Miami-Dade \nCounty.  MFP expended time and money to organize its membership for the April 28th \nRBA demonstration event and the September 15th events, but MFP was impeded in its \nability to organize and generate turnout by Defendant Miami-Dade County’s ordinances \nand actions, and suffered damages as a direct and proximate result of defendant’s policies \nand practices. \nMFP will be marching in solidarity with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers \n(also referred to hereinafter as “CIW”) through Miami-Dade County for the “March on \nBurger King Headquarters” on November 30, 2007, and with other peace-oriented groups \nin an “End the War” March and Rally on March 22, 2008, as more fully set forth herein. \n \n  3 \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA   Document 43   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/14/2007   Page 4 of 19\n5.  Plaintiff  SOUTH  FLORIDA  PEACE  &  JUSTICE  NETWORK \n(hereinafter “SFPJN”) is an unincorporated network of peace and social justice groups in \nthe  Miami-Dade/Broward/Palm  Beach  tri-county  region.    Among  the  activities  that \nSFPJN has participated in or organized, since early 2006, are: a march and rally in Fort \nLauderdale in March 2006 to commemorate the third anniversary of the Iraq War, which \ninvolved temporary lane closures along State Road 84, a major east-west artery in Fort \nLauderdale; attendance at rallies and demonstrations in support of striking janitors at the \nUniversity of Miami and janitors at Nova Southeastern University fired for unionizing \nefforts in 2006; a demonstration to support the campaign of the Coalition of Immokalee \nWorkers to convince Burger King to assure that tomato pickers are paid a decent wage; \nactivities in support of the Umoja Village, an encampment in the Liberty City area of \nMiami for people lacking housing.  SFPJN was a participating entity in RBA, and many \nof its member organizations participated in the April 28th march and rally at Miami-Dade \nCollege.   Members of SFPJN actively organized and participated in the September 15th \n“End the War” March and Rally in Miami-Dade County.  SFPJN expended time and \nmoney to organize its membership for the April 28th RBA demonstration event and the \nSeptember 15th events, but SFPJN was impeded in its ability to organize and generate \nturnout  by  Defendant  Miami-Dade  County’s  ordinances  and  actions,  and  suffered \ndamages as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s policies and practices. \nSFPJN will be marching in solidarity with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers \n(also referred to hereinafter as “CIW”) through Miami-Dade County for the “March on \nBurger King Headquarters” on November 30, 2007, and with other peace-oriented groups \nin an “End the War” March and Rally on March 22, 2008, as more fully set forth herein. \n \n6.  Plaintiff  HAITI  SOLIDARITY  (hereinafter  “HS”)  is  a  not-for-profit \ncorporation located in Miami, Florida, having been incorporated since 2004 in the State \nof Florida.  Among the activities HS has participated in are a mass rally of 1,000 people \nwithin the past month in front of the Immigration building at the corner of  NE 79th Street \nand Biscayne Boulevard, to protest discrimination against Haitians who recently came \n  4 \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA   Document 43   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/14/2007   Page 5 of 19\nashore at Hallandale Beach, Florida; various immigrants’ rights demonstrations during \n2006, some in downtown Miami and others at the Immigration building on NE 79th \nStreet; and a march of approximately 6,000 people in downtown Miami to urge that the \nHaitian government free Father Gerard Jean-Juste, which took place approximately a year \nand a half ago.   Plaintiff HS brought one of the largest contingents of demonstrators to \nthe April 28th demonstration at Miami-Dade College.   Members of HS actively organized \nand participated in the September 15th “End the War” March and Rally in Miami-Dade \nCounty.  HS expended time and money to organize its membership for the April 28th \nRBA demonstration event and the September 15th events, but HS was impeded in its \nability to organize and generate turnout by Defendant Miami-Dade County’s ordinances \nand  actions,  and  suffered  damages  as  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of  Defendant’s \npolicies and practices. \nHS will be marching in solidarity with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (also \nreferred to hereinafter as “CIW”) through Miami-Dade County for the “March on Burger \nKing Headquarters” on November 30, 2007, and with other peace-oriented groups in an \n“End the War” March and Rally on March 22, 2008, as more fully set forth herein. \n \nDefendant : \n \n7.  Defendant  MIAMI-DADE  COUNTY  (hereinafter  “M-D  County”)  is  a \npolitical subdivision of the State of Florida, with the capacity to sue and be sued.  It is the \nlegal entity  responsible for the actions of the Miami-Dade  County  Board  of County \nCommissioners (hereinafter “M-D BCC”), including the County Code promulgated by \nthe  M-D  BCC,  as  well  as  the  actions  of  law  enforcement  officers  employed  in  the \nCounty.  M-D County controls and is responsible for the Miami-Dade Police Department \n(hereinafter “M-D PD”), including the actions taken by the Metropolitan Sheriff and law \nenforcement officers employed by the M-D PD. \n \n   \n  5 \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA   Document 43   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/14/2007   Page 6 of 19\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS COMMON TO ALL COUNTS \n \nMiami-Dade County Code Provisions: \n8.  Miami-Dade County has an antiquated permit scheme for all parades in the \nunincorporated portions of the county, first adopted in 1971 and apparently last revised in \n1973.  Provisions of this type have been repeatedly condemned insofar as they are clearly \nviolative  of  First  Amendment  protections  for  the  freedoms  of  speech,  assembly  and \npetition,  and  Fourteenth  Amendment  protections  of  property  interests  and  liberty \ninterests. \n \n9.  Miami-Dade Code § 30-274:  Parades and processions; permit required \nIn  the  unincorporated  areas,  no  procession  or  parade, \nexcepting  the forces  of United States Armed Services, the \nmilitary forces of the State, the forces of the police and fire \ndepartments, and funeral processions, shall occupy, march, or \nproceed along any street or roadway  except in accordance \nwith a permit issued by the Sheriff and such other regulations \nas are set forth herein which may apply. \n \n10.  Miami-Dade County has a code provision criminalizing the standing or \nremaining on any public sidewalk or public place so as to hinder or impede the passage \nof pedestrians or vehicles; this section was first adopted in 1967, and last revised in 1982.  \nThis criminalization of loitering contains no exception for First Amendment-protected \nactivity or for innocent conduct protected by federal jurisprudence. \n11.  Miami-Dade County Code § 21-31.1:  Disorderly Conduct, Loitering, \nPenalties. \n  6 \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA   Document 43   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/14/2007   Page 7 of 19\n(b)  Loitering.  For the purpose of this section “loitering” \nmeans the act of standing, remaining or sleeping on, in or \nabout  any  public  street,  public  sidewalk,  public  overpass, \npublic  bridge,  public  library  or  other  place  specifically \nenumerated herein.  A person commits the offense of loitering \nwhen he knowingly: \n(1)  Loiters  on  any  public  street,  public  sidewalk, \npublic overpass, public bridge or public place so as to \nhinder  or  impede  the  passage  of  pedestrians  or \nvehicles. \n. . . \n(4)  Loiters in or about a school, college or university \ncampus so as to hinder to impede the orderly conduct \nof instructional, recreational or other school activities. \n. . . \n(c)   Penalties for violation.  . . . Any person convicted of a \nviolation  of  any  other  subsection  of  this  section  shall  be \npunished by a fine of five hundred dollars ($500.00) or by \nimprisonment in the County Jail for a term not to exceed sixty \n(60)  days,  or  by  both  such  fine  and  imprisonment,  in  the \ndiscretion of the court.  This section is applicable in both the \nincorporated  and  unincorporated  areas  of  Miami-Dade \nCounty and all violations thereof shall be prosecuted in the \nCounty Court. \n \nPlaintiffs’ Past Efforts to Obtain Permit to Demonstrate in Parade & \nRally: \n     \n12.  Various groups in the social justice and peace movements learned in March \n2007 that President George W. Bush was scheduled to give a commencement address on \nApril 28th at Miami-Dade College.  Initial inquiries to the county police relating to the \npossible  need  for  a  permit  to  march,  rally  and  otherwise  demonstrate  during  the \nPresident’s visit were made on or about April 1, 2007, by Ray Del Papa of Plaintiff \nSFPJN.  A tentative meeting to resolve demonstration issues was set for April 6th, but this \nmeeting was cancelled by the Miami-Dade Police Department (“M-D PD”). \n \n  7 \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA   Document 43   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/14/2007   Page 8 of 19\n13.  On April 14th Linda Belgrave of MFP received an e-mail from M-D PD \nindicating that M-D PD would not accommodate a “march route” for the demonstration \nplanned on April 28th.  No reason for the arbitrary rejection was provided by the M-D PD. \n \n14.  As to the request for a location for a rally, Ms. Belgrave was advised that \nthe M-D PD was not willing to meet to discuss a demonstration location until just a few \ndays prior to the event date.  On April 16th, Ms. Belgrave received numerous inquiries by \norganizations seeking information about the RBA demonstration, particularly the march \nroute.  Ms. Belgrave advised these organizations that county authorities had refused to \neither approve tentative plans or to meet to discuss critical issues.   \n \n15.  On April 17th and 18th, upon request by the Plaintiffs, legal counsel for \nPlaintiffs attempted to resolve outstanding issues arising from the RBA political march \nand rally with Miami-Dade County, to no avail. \n \n16.  The refusal by the M-D PD to accommodate the RBA’s proposed political \nparade route, and the failure of the M-D PD to provide a location for the post-parade \nrally, caused legitimate fear among the Plaintiffs that the M-D PD would endeavor to \nshut down any rally on April 28th through enforcement of its quarter-century old loitering \nordinance. \n \n  8 \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA   Document 43   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/14/2007   Page 9 of 19\n17.  In light of the M-D PD’S denial of a lane closure for the political parade in which \nPlaintiffs planned to participate on April 28th, the hundreds of participants, including Plaintiffs’ \nmembers, were forced to crowd onto the sidewalks, and legitimately feared that they risked arrest \nfor hindering or impeding the passage of pedestrians.  Additionally, Plaintiffs were aware that \nthe loitering ordinance carried maximum penalties of a $500.00 fine and/or sixty (60) days in \njail, which are serious penalties that discouraged participation in the march.  The County’s \nparade permit ordinance and its loitering ordinance infringed upon Plaintiffs’ First Amendment \nright to peaceably assemble, and to be visible on the street to their intended audience while \nexercising their First Amendment freedoms of speech, assembly and petition. \n \n18.  As a result of the impact of the Defendants’ parade permit scheme and \noverbroad loitering ordinance, the Plaintiffs were forced to seek judicial relief by way of \nthe  filing,  in  U.S.  District  Court,  of  a  Verified  Complaint,  Emergency  Motion  for \nPreliminary Injunctive Relief, Memorandum of Law supporting said motion, and related \npapers.    As  a  result  of  this  civil  action,  Defendant  Miami-Dade  County  finally \nacquiesced,  and  agreed  to  accommodate  the  Plaintiffs’  First  Amendment-protected \nactivity. \n  \n September 15, 2007 Demonstration Event: \n19.  MFP, SFPJN, HS and other organizations held a march and rally in Miami-\nDade County on Bird Road (SW 42nd Street) between Noon and 2:00 p.m. on September \n15, 2007.  The proposed march route was about a half-mile long, starting just north of the \n  9 \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA   Document 43   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/14/2007   Page 10 of 19\nKendall Regional Medical Center, at Bird Road (SW 42nd Street) and SW 119th Avenue, \nand proceeding westbound along Bird Road, stopping between SW 128th and SW 129th \nAvenues, at the Congressional Field Office of U.S. Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, \nlocated at 12851 SW 42nd Street.  At the conclusion of the march, the march participants \nheld a rally in front of the Congressman’s office. \n20.  MFP,  SFPJN,  HS  and  other  organizations  participating  in  this  event \nexpended  time  and  money  to  organize  members  and  community  residents  for  the \nSeptember 15th demonstration event, but the Plaintiffs were impeded in their ability to \norganize  and  generate  turnout  by  Defendant  M-D  County’s  ordinances,  and  suffered \ndamages as a direct result of the Defendant M-D County’s policies and practices. \n \nNovember 30, 2007 Demonstration Event \n21.  MFP,  SFPJN,  HS  and  other  organizations  are  planning  to  march  in  an \napproximately eight-mile parade from downtown Miami through unincorporated Miami-\nDade County on November 30, 2007, as part of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers’ \n“March on Burger King Headquarters,” a feature event in the Campaign for Fair Food.  \nThe  proposed  parade  route  will  require  the  use  of  public  highways,  and  the  parade \norganizers and participants have a legitimate fear that M-D County parade permit scheme \nand loitering ordinances may be used to hinder this First Amendment-protected event. \n \n \n  10 \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA   Document 43   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/14/2007   Page 11 of 19\nMarch 22, 2008 Demonstration Event \n22.  MFP, SFPJN, HS and other organizations are planning a parade and rally in \nunincorporated Miami-Dade County, in the area near Miami-Dade College, on March 22, \n2008, for an “End the War” demonstration event.  The proposed parade route will begin \nnear the east side of Miami-Dade College at SW 100th Street and SW 107th Avenue, \nproceeding west on SW 104th Street to the college’s entrance, with a peace rally at that \nlocation.  The proposed parade route will require the use of public highway lanes, and the \nparade  organizers  and  participants  have  a  legitimate  fear  that  M-D  County’s  parade \npermit scheme and loitering ordinances may be used to hinder this First Amendment-\nprotected event. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \n23.  As to each cause of action delineated below in Counts One through Three, \nPlaintiffs advance their federal constitutional claims against the governmental entities as \nstate actors, through the operation of the Fourteenth Amendment. \nCOUNT ONE \nMonell Claim - Official Policy to Suppress Protected Speech and Assembly \n(42 USC § 1983  – Violation of First Amendment - Various Grounds) \nCounty Code § 30-274 – Parades & Processions Ordinance \nBy ALL PLAINTIFFS Against MIAMI-DADE COUNTY \n \n24.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate each jurisdictional and factual allegation \nof Paragraphs 1-23, as if set forth at length herein.   \n \n  11 \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA   Document 43   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/14/2007   Page 12 of 19\n25.  At  all  times  relevant  hereto,  the  Miami-Dade  County  Board  of  County \nCommissioners (“M-D BCC”) was the final policymaker of Miami-Dade County (“M-\nDC”)    for  purposes  of  adopting  ordinances  and  other  policies  formally  regulating \nconstitutionally-protected expression and assembly within the county’s boundaries. \n \n26.  In  December,  1971,  the  M-D  BCC  enacted  Ordinance  No.  71-94,  now \ncodified  at  County  Code  §  30-274  (not  revised  since  March,  1973),  precluding  any \n“procession or parade” in the unincorporated areas of Miami-Dade County, except in \naccordance with a permit issued by the Sheriff.   This Parades & Processions Ordinance \nis unconstitutional on its face as an impermissible prior restraint, containing terms which \nprovide  unfettered  discretion  to  law  enforcement  officials,  lack  of  deadlines  for \nconsidering applications, lack of appropriate review for unfavorable decisions, and other \ndeficiencies. \n \n27.  County Code § 30-274 was used as the basis for defendant M-DC’s refusal \nto issue a permit for the Plaintiffs’ political march on April 28, 2007, and it is reasonably \nanticipated by Plaintiffs that said ordinance has or will be used as the basis to delay or \nrefuse  the  issuance  of  a  permit  for  the  Plaintiffs’  planned  parades  and  rallies  on \nSeptember 15, 2007, November 30, 2007 and March 22, 2008. \n \n28.  The adoption by the M-D BCC of Code § 30-274, and the implementation \nof this Parades and Processions Ordinance by the M-D PD, were the proximate cause of \nthe deprivation of the First Amendment rights of Plaintiffs and other demonstrators for \nthe planned activities  on April 28,  2007 and September  15, 2007, on public streets, \nsidewalks and other public property adjacent to M-D College, and are the proximate \ncause  of  the  “chilling,”  including  reluctance  of  some  to  participate,  uncertainty  and \nconfusion, surrounding the Plaintiffs’ First Amendment-protected core political events on \n  12 \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA   Document 43   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/14/2007   Page 13 of 19\nNovember 3, 2007 and March 22, 2008.   Further, the expenditure of money by the \nPlaintiffs for printing, travel and related expenses for portions of these events negatively \nimpacted  by  the  Defendant’s  ordinances  entitles  them  to  compensatory  damages.  \nPlaintiffs seek redress for this violation of the First Amendment through the operation of \n42 U.S.C. § 1983.  \n \nCOUNT  TWO \nMonell Claim - Official Policy to Suppress Protected Speech and Assembly \n(42 USC § 1983  – Violation of First Amendment - Overbreadth) \nCounty Code § 21-31.1 – Loitering Ordinance \nBy ALL PLAINTIFFS Against MIAMI-DADE COUNTY \n \n29.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate each jurisdictional and factual allegation \nof Paragraphs 1-23, as if set forth at length herein.   \n \n30.  At all times relevant hereto, the M-D BCC was the final policymaker of \nMiami-Dade County for purposes of adopting ordinances and other policies formally \nregulating  conduct  in  public,  including  constitutionally-protected  expression  and \nassembly within the county’s boundaries. \n \n31.  In March, 1967, the M-D BCC enacted Ordinance No. 67-17, now codified \nat County Code § 21-31.1.   The  Loitering Ordinance provides that it is unlawful to \nengage in “standing” or “remaining” on any public street, sidewalk or “place” so as to \nhinder or impede vehicular or pedestrian traffic, see M-D County Code § 21-31.1 (b) (1).  \nThis section is applicable in the incorporated and unincorporated areas of Miami-Dade \nCounty.

This  Loitering  Ordinance  is  unconstitutional  on  its  face  as  an \nimpermissibly  overbroad  prohibition,  that  has  had,  and  will  in  the  future  have,  a \nsubstantial  impact  on  conduct  protected  by  the  First  Amendment,  including  the \nexpressive conduct of these Plaintiffs. \n \n33.  The anticipated use of County Code § 21-31.1 by the M-D PD has chilled \nthe First Amendment-protected activities of the Plaintiffs in the past, and may cause the \narrest of members of the plaintiffs, as well as others similarly situated who wish to \nexercise their rights of free speech, assembly and association on November 30, 2007 and \nMarch 22, 2008. \n \n34.  The adoption by the M-D BCC of Code § 21-31.1, and the implementation \nof this Loitering Ordinance by the M-DPD were the proximate cause of the deprivation \nof the First Amendment rights of Plaintiffs, and other demonstrators similarly situated, \nwith respect to the activities on April 28, 2007 and September 15, 2007 on public streets, \nsidewalks and other public property adjacent to M-D College, and are the proximate \ncause  of  the  “chilling,”  including  reluctance  of  some  to  participate,  uncertainty  and \nconfusion, surrounding the Plaintiffs’ First Amendment-protected core political events on \nNovember 30, 2007 and March 22, 2008.  Plaintiffs seek redress for this violation of the \nFirst Amendment through the operation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n \n  14 \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA   Document 43   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/14/2007   Page 15 of 19\nCOUNT  THREE \nMonell Claim - Official Policy to Suppress Protected Speech and Assembly \n(42 USC § 1983  – Violation of 14th Amendment – Vagueness and Liberty Interest) \nCounty Code § 21-31.1 – Loitering Ordinance \nBy ALL PLAINTIFFS Against MIAMI-DADE COUNTY \n \n35.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate each jurisdictional and factual allegation \nof Paragraphs 1-23, as if set forth at length herein.   \n \n36.  At all times relevant hereto, the M-D BCC was the final policymaker of \nMiami-Dade County for purposes of adopting ordinances and other policies formally \nregulating  conduct  in  public,  including  constitutionally-protected  expression  and \nassembly within the county’s boundaries. \n \n37.    In March, 1967, the M-D BCC enacted Ordinance No. 67-17, now \ncodified  at  County  Code  §  21-31.1.      The    Loitering  Ordinance  provides  that  it  is \nunlawful to engage in “standing” or “remaining” on any public street, sidewalk or “place” \nso as to hinder or impede vehicular or pedestrian traffic, see M-D County Code § 21-31.1 \n(b) (1).  This section is applicable in the incorporated and unincorporated areas of Miami-\nDade County, see M-D County Code § 21-31.1 (c). \n \n38.  This  Loitering  Ordinance  is  unconstitutional  on  its  face,  as  an \nimpermissibly vague prohibition that has a substantial impact on conduct protected by the \nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, for two reasons.   First, this ordinance \nfails to provide the kind of notice that enables ordinary  citizens to understand what \nprecise  conduct  it  prohibits;  second,  it  authorizes  arbitrary  and  discriminatory \nenforcement through its lack of precision. \n  15 \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA   Document 43   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/14/2007   Page 16 of 19\n \n39.  This  Loitering  Ordinance  is  further  unconstitutional  on  its  face  as  an \nimpermissible prohibition on conduct that is protected by the liberty interest arising from \nthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.   The members of the plaintiff \norganizations  have  a  significant  liberty  interest  in  standing  on  public  sidewalks  and \npublic places according to their inclination. \n \n40.  The  use  of  County  Code  §  21-31.1  by  the  M-D  PD  chilled  the  First \nAmendment-protected activities of the Plaintiffs on April 28, 2007 and September 15, \n2007, and may cause the arrest of members of the Plaintiffs’ organizations, as well as \nothers similarly situated who wish to exercise their rights of free speech, assembly and \nassociation, on November 30, 2007 and March 22, 2008. \n \n41.  The adoption by the M-D BCC of Code § 21-31.1, and the past and future \nimplementation of this Loitering Ordinance by the M-D PD in a manner disallowed by \nthe  14th  Amendment,  are  the  proximate  cause  of  the  past  deprivation  of  the  First \nAmendment rights of Plaintiffs without due process, and other demonstrators similarly \nsituated, on April 28, 2007 and September 15, 2007, with respect to the planned activities \non public streets, sidewalks and other public property adjacent to M-D College, and the \nproximate cause of the “chilling,” including reluctance of some to participate, uncertainty \nand  confusion,  the  Plaintiffs’  First  Amendment-protected  core  political  events  on \nNovember 30, 2007 and March 22, 2008.  Further, the expenditure of money by the \nPlaintiffs for printing, travel and related expenses for portions of these events negatively \nimpacted  by  the  Defendant’s  ordinances  entitles  them  to  compensatory  damages.  \nPlaintiffs seek redress for this violation of the 14th Amendment through the operation of \n42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n \n  16 \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA   Document 43   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/14/2007   Page 17 of 19\nPRAYER  FOR  RELIEF  -  ALL  COUNTS \n         \n  WHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  seek  judgment  against  Defendant  for  the  following \nrelief: \n1.

Plaintiffs request partial\nsummary judgment in their favor regarding Defendant, Miami-Dade County’s liability for all three\ncounts of Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint [D.E. 43].  The undersigned has considered the\nparties’ written submissions, the record, and applicable law.\nI.  BACKGROUND\n1\nPlaintiffs, Miami for Peace (“MFP”), South Florida Peace & Justice Network (“SFPJ”), and\nHaiti Solidarity (“HS”) (collectively, the “Plaintiffs”) are not-for-profit corporations operating in\nMiami, Florida.  In April 2007, Plaintiffs planned and organized an anti-war demonstration to coincide\nwith a commencement address given by President George W. Bush at the Miami-Dade College\n(“MDC”) campus in Kendall, Florida, on April 28, 2007 (the “April Protest”).  As part of the April\n1  Unless otherwise specified, all facts contained in this section are undisputed.\n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 81      Entered on FLSD Docket 06/04/2008     Page 2 of 21\nCase No.  07-21088-CIV-ALTONAGA/Brown\nProtest, Plaintiffs sought to have their members march on S.W. 107th Avenue and S.W. 104th Street\nto the entrance of the MDC campus.  Miami-Dade County (the “County”) has a parade permit\nrequirement (“Permit Ordinance”) for any parades or processions in the unincorporated areas of the\nCounty, which includes the area surrounding the MDC campus.  The County’s Permit Ordinance\nprovides as follows:\nIn the unincorporated areas, no procession or parade, excepting the forces of the\nUnited States Armed Services, the military forces of the state, and the forces of the\npolice and fire departments, and funeral processions, shall occupy, march, or proceed\nalong the street or roadway except in accordance with a permit issued by the sheriff\nand such other regulations as are set forth herein which may apply.  No sound truck\nor other vehicle equipped with amplifier or loudspeaker shall be driven upon any\nstreet except in accordance with a permit issued by the sheriff. \nMiami Dade Code § 30-274 [D.E. 62-2].\nAlthough  Plaintiffs were informed by the County that they could hold their planned\ndemonstration, they were denied a permit to march or process along any of the roadways surrounding\nthe MDC campus.  The County submits that on April 18, 2007, it informed one of the attorneys for\nthe Plaintiffs that a permit would not be issued for the planned demonstration because shutting down\nthe streets surrounding the MDC campus would cause “congestion and not allow ingress and egress\nfor emergency vehicles, creating serious security and public safety problems, especially considering\nthe presence of the President of the United States.”  (Declaration of Robert L. Diers (“Diers Decl.”)\n[D.E. 72-2] at ¶ 5).2  The County also submits that a permit is only required for parades or\n2  Plaintiffs contend that the original version of the Diers Declaration lacked an executed signature page and\ntherefore cannot be properly considered on summary judgment.  The County, however, provided the executed signature\npage along with a Notice [D.E. 77] on May 27, 2008, notifying the Court that the page was inadvertently omitted from\nthe initial filing.  The undersigned, therefore, considers the Diers Declaration for purposes of this Motion.  \n2\n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 81      Entered on FLSD Docket 06/04/2008     Page 3 of 21\nCase No.  07-21088-CIV-ALTONAGA/Brown\nprocessions, and that the Permit Ordinance is inapplicable to First Amendment demonstrations.  (See\nid. at ¶ 8).\nUnable to secure a permit for the April Protest, Plaintiffs claim their members were fearful of\narrest or prosecution under Miami-Dade County Code § 21-31.1, the County’s anti-loitering\nordinance (the “Loitering Ordinance”).  The Loitering Ordinance provides, in relevant part, as\nfollows:\n(b) Loitering For the purposes of this Section “loitering” means the act of standing,\nremaining or sleeping on, in or about any public street, public sidewalk, public\noverpass, public bridge, public library, or other place specifically enumerated herein.\nA person commits the offense of loitering when he knowingly:\n(1)  Loiters on any public street, public sidewalk, public overpass, public bridge or\npublic place so as to hinder or impede the passage of pedestrians or vehicles.\n. . . \n(4) Loiters in or about a school, college or university campus so as to hinder or\nimpede the orderly conduct of instructional, recreational, or other school activities.\n. . . \n(c) Penalties for violation . . . Any person convicted of a violation of any subsection\nof this section shall be punished by a fine of five hundred dollars ($500.00) or by\nimprisonment in the County Jail for a term not to exceed sixty (60) days, or by both\nsuch fine and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court.  This section is applicable\nin both the incorporated and unincorporated areas of Miami-Dade County and all\nviolations thereof shall be prosecuted in the County Court. \nMiami-Dade County Code § 21-31.1.\nThe County has offered testimony from one of its representatives, Robert Diers, that the\nCounty “has rarely, if ever, enforced” the Loitering Ordinance, and that the “Miami-Dade Police\nDepartment does not have any recent history of enforcing [it] against First Amendment demonstrators\n3\n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 81      Entered on FLSD Docket 06/04/2008     Page 4 of 21\nCase No.  07-21088-CIV-ALTONAGA/Brown\nor protestors.”  (Diers Decl. at ¶ 13).  Diers also testified that the Loitering Ordinance is not included\nin the handbook of criminal statutes provided to Miami-Dade Police officers.  (See id. at ¶ 14).\nIn light of Plaintiffs’ conclusion that the Permit Ordinance and the Loitering Ordinance would\nimpair their ability to hold the April Protest, Plaintiffs filed their initial Complaint [D.E. 1] on April\n24, 2007, accompanied by an Emergency Motion for a Preliminary Injunction [D.E. 3].  Upon the\nagreement of the parties, the Court entered an Order [D.E. 13] that the County would not enforce\neither of the two challenged ordinances during the April Protest, and denied Plaintiffs’ Emergency\nMotion  as  moot.    The  April  Protest  was  subsequently  able  to  proceed,  although  with  the\nunderstanding that no traffic lanes or streets would be closed.  The demonstrations, therefore, were\nlimited to the sidewalks and grassy areas surrounding the MDC campus.  None of Plaintiffs’ members\nat the April Protest were arrested or threatened with arrest for violation of the County’s Loitering\nOrdinance.  (See Diers. Decl. at ¶ 12).\nPlaintiffs, MFP and SFPJN, intend to hold future demonstrations in Miami-Dade County,\nincluding an anticipated demonstration on election day, November 4, 2008.  (See Declaration of\nLinda Belgrave (“Belgrave Decl.”) [D.E. 62-3] at ¶ 3).  They anticipate the planned demonstrations\nwill require street closures.  (See id. at ¶ 5).  As a result, Plaintiffs submit the County’s Permit\nOrdinance and Loitering Ordinance will impede their efforts to plan these future demonstrations (see\nid. at ¶ 6), and discourage future participants from exercising their First Amendment rights (see id.\nat ¶ 8).\nPlaintiffs filed their Second Amended Complaint on September 14, 2007.  The Second\nAmended Complaint contains three counts pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Count I alleges the Permit\n4\n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 81      Entered on FLSD Docket 06/04/2008     Page 5 of 21\nCase No.  07-21088-CIV-ALTONAGA/Brown\nOrdinance “is unconstitutional on its face as an impermissible prior restraint, containing terms which\nprovide  unfettered  discretion  to  law  enforcement  officials,  lack  of  deadlines  for  considering\napplications, lack of appropriate review for unfavorable decisions, and other deficiencies.”  (Second\nAmended  Complaint  at  ¶  26).    It  further  alleges  the  Permit  Ordinance  and  the  County’s\nimplementation of that Ordinance, “were the proximate cause of the deprivation of the First\nAmendment rights of Plaintiffs and other demonstrators [at the April Protest] . . . and are the\nproximate cause of the ‘chilling,’” of Plaintiffs’ activities at other demonstrations in the County.  (Id.\nat ¶ 28).  Plaintiffs also seek compensatory damages for “the expenditure of money . . . for printing,\ntravel and related expenses for portions of [their planned events] negatively impacted by the\nDefendant’s ordinances . . . .”  (Id.)\nCount II of the Second Amended Complaint alleges that  the  Loitering Ordinance is\nunconstitutional on its face as an impermissibly broad prohibition, that has had, and will in the future\nhave, a substantial impact on conduct protected by the First Amendment . . . .”  (Id. at ¶ 32).  It\nfurther alleges that the County’s adoption and implementation of the Loitering Ordinance “were the\nproximate  cause  of  the  deprivation  of  the  First  Amendment  rights  of  Plaintiffs,  and  other\ndemonstrators similarly situated, with respect to the [April Protest] . . . on public streets, sidewalks,\nand other public property adjacent to [the MDC campus], and are the proximate cause of the\n‘chilling,’”  of  Plaintiffs’  activities  at  other  demonstrations  in  the  County.    (Id.  at  ¶  34). \nFinally, Count III alleges the Loitering Ordinance is “unconstitutional on its face, as an\nimpermissibly vague prohibition that has a substantial impact on conduct protected by the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment” because “it fails to provide the kind of notice that\n5\n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 81      Entered on FLSD Docket 06/04/2008     Page 6 of 21\nCase No.  07-21088-CIV-ALTONAGA/Brown\nenables ordinary citizens to understand what precise conduct it prohibits” and “authorizes arbitrary\nand discriminatory enforcement through its lack of precision.”  (Id. at ¶ 38) (emphasis in original).\nIt further alleges the adoption and implementation of the Loitering Ordinance “are the proximate\ncause of the past deprivation of the First Amendment rights of Plaintiffs without due process, and\nother demonstrators similarly situated [at the April Protest] . . . with respect to the planned activities\non public streets, sidewalks and other public property adjacent to [the MDC campus], and the\nproximate cause of the ‘chilling,’” of Plaintiffs’ activities at other demonstrations in the County.  (Id.\nat ¶ 41).  As a result of this deprivation, Plaintiffs also seek compensatory damages.  (See id.).\nPlaintiffs filed the present Motion seeking partial summary judgment on all counts as to the\nfollowing issues: (1) Plaintiffs’ entitlement to a permanent injunction, enjoining Defendant from\nenforcing the Permit Ordinance and the Loitering Ordinance; (2) Plaintiffs’ entitlement to a\ndeclaration that the Permit Ordinance and Loitering Ordinance violate Plaintiffs’ rights under the First\nAmendment; and (3) Plaintiffs’ entitlement to a declaration that the Loitering Ordinance violates\nPlaintiffs’ due process rights.  \nII.  ANALYSIS\nA.  Legal Standard\nSummary judgment shall be rendered “if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories,\nand admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to\nany material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 56(c).  In making this assessment, the Court “must view all the evidence and all factual inferences\nreasonably drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.”  Stewart v.\n6\n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 81      Entered on FLSD Docket 06/04/2008     Page 7 of 21\nCase No.  07-21088-CIV-ALTONAGA/Brown\nHappy Herman’s Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1285 (11th Cir. 1997), and “must resolve\nall reasonable doubts about the facts in favor of the non-movant.”  United of Omaha Life Ins. Co.\nv. Sun Life Ins. Co. of Am., 894 F.2d 1555, 1558 (11th Cir. 1990).\n“By its very terms, this standard provides that the mere existence of some alleged factual\ndispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary\njudgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact.”  Anderson v. Liberty\nLobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48 (1986) (emphasis in original).  “As to materiality, the substantive\nlaw will identify which facts are material.  Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of\nthe suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment.  Factual\ndisputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted.”  Id. at 248.  Likewise, a dispute\nabout a material fact is a “genuine” issue “if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return\na verdict for the nonmoving party.”  Id.  However, “[t]he mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in\nsupport of the position will be insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably\nfind for the [non-movant].”  Id. at 252,\n“For factual issues to be considered genuine, they must have a real basis in the record . . .\nmere conclusions and unsupported factual allegations are legally insufficient to defeat a summary\njudgment motion.”  Ellis v. England, 432 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir. 2005) (citations omitted).  The\nmoving party “always bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its\nmotion, and identifying those portions of the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and\nadmissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, which it believes demonstrate the absence of\na genuine issue of material fact.”  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).  Summary\n7\n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 81      Entered on FLSD Docket 06/04/2008     Page 8 of 21\nCase No.  07-21088-CIV-ALTONAGA/Brown\njudgment is proper “against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence\nof an element essential to that party’s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at\ntrial.”  Id. at 322.  In those cases, there is no genuine issue of material fact “since a complete failure\nof proof concerning an essential element of the nonmoving party’s case necessarily renders all other\nfacts immaterial.”  Id. at 323.\nB.  Plaintiffs’ Standing to Seek Declaratory Relief\nPlaintiffs seek declaratory relief on their claims that the Permit Ordinance and the Loitering\nOrdinance violate their constitutional rights.  Generally, federal courts are empowered to issue a\ndeclaratory judgment prohibiting the enforcement of an ordinance or statute that is determined to be\nunconstitutional.  See, e.g., Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, 546 U.S. 320,\n331 (2006); Bischoff v. Osceola County, Fla., 222 F.3d 874, 877 (11th Cir. 2000); Beaulieu v. City\nof Alabaster, 454 F.3d 1219, 1234 (11th Cir. 2006) (affirming district court’s declaratory judgment\nthat sign ordinance violated the First Amendment). \nNevertheless, “Article III of the United States Constitution limits the power of the federal\ncourts to hear ‘cases’ and ‘controversies.’”  Midrash Sephardi, Inc. v. Town of Surfside, 366 F.3d\n1214, 1223 (11th Cir. 2004) (citing U.S. Const. Art. III, § 2).  The most significant element of “case\nor controversy” is the requirement of standing.  See id. (citation omitted).  “[E]very court has an\nindependent duty to review standing as a basis for jurisdiction at any time, for every case it\nadjudicates.”  Florida Ass’n of Medical Equipment Dealers, Med-Health Care v. Apfel, 194 F.3d\n1227, 1230 (11th Cir. 1999) (citing FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas, 493 U.S. 215, 231 (1990)).  In order\nto demonstrate it has standing a party must show: “1) an injury in fact or an invasion of a legally\n8\n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 81      Entered on FLSD Docket 06/04/2008     Page 9 of 21\nCase No.  07-21088-CIV-ALTONAGA/Brown\nprotected interest; 2) a direct causal relationship between the injury and the challenged action; and\n3) a likelihood of redressability.”  Midrash, 366 F.3d at 1223 (citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,\n504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992)). \n“The requirements for standing are somewhat more lenient for facial challenges to statutes\non the grounds of overbreadth.”  Bischoff, 222 F.3d at 883; see also Digital Properties, Inc. v. City\nof Plantation, 121 F.3d 586, 590 (11th Cir. 1997) (“[T]he injury requirement is most loosely applied\nwhen a plaintiff asserts a violation of First Amendment rights based on the enforcement of a law,\nregulation or policy.”).  “However, even under the more lenient requirements for standing applicable\nto First Amendment overbreadth challenges, it still remains the law that plaintiffs must establish that\nthey have suffered some injury in fact as a result of the defendant’s actions.”  Bischoff, 222 F.3d at\n883 (citations omitted). \nThe County does not question Plaintiffs’ standing to challenge the Permit Ordinance on the\nground of constitutional overbreadth.  Moreover, upon the Court’s own review, it is plain that\nPlaintiffs easily satisfy the permissive standing requirement for such a challenge.  See id.  Plaintiffs\nare involved in the planning and execution of public demonstrations.  Plaintiffs and their members\nwere denied a permit for the April Protest under the Permit Ordinance, and they submit their First\nAmendment rights were infringed as a result of this denial.  They further submit they intend to engage\nin future demonstrations for which they will require additional permits under the current licensing\nscheme.  (See Belgrave Decl. at ¶¶ 3-5). \nThe  County  does,  however,  challenge  Plaintiffs’  standing  to  challenge  the  Loitering\nOrdinance.  Specifically, the County asserts Plaintiffs lack “associational standing” to challenge the\n9\n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 81      Entered on FLSD Docket 06/04/2008     Page 10 of 21\nCase No.  07-21088-CIV-ALTONAGA/Brown\nLoitering Ordinance on behalf of their members.  “‘(W)hether an association has standing to invoke\nthe court’s remedial powers on behalf of its members depends in substantial measure on the nature\nof the relief sought.’”  Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343\n(1977) (quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 515 (1975)).  “‘If . . . the association seeks a\ndeclaration, injunction, or some other form of prospective relief, it can reasonably be supposed that\nthe remedy, if granted, will inure to the benefit of those members of the association actually injured.’”\nId. (quoting Warth, 422 U.S. at 515).  Thus, “an association has standing to bring suit on behalf of\nits members when: (a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the\ninterests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization’s purpose; and (c) neither the claim\nasserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.”  Id.;\naccord Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 181\n(2000). \nThe text of the Loitering Ordinance is exceedingly broad in scope.  A person commits the\noffense of loitering “when he knowingly . . . [l]oiters on any public street, public sidewalk, public\noverpass, public bridge or public place so as to hinder or impede the passage of pedestrians or\nvehicles” or “[l]oiters in or about a school, college or university campus so as to hinder or impede\nthe orderly conduct of instructional, recreational, or other school activities.”   Miami-Dade County\nCode § 21-31.  The range of activities that can “impede” the passage of pedestrians or vehicles, or\n“hinder” the orderly conduct of school activities is limitless.  The awkward and sweeping language\nof the Ordinance results in a legislative pronouncement that defines loitering with use of the term it\nseeks to define: “knowingly . . . [l]oitering” in selected public areas, “so as to hinder or impede the\n10\n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 81      Entered on FLSD Docket 06/04/2008     Page 11 of 21\nCase No.  07-21088-CIV-ALTONAGA/Brown\npassage of pedestrians or vehicles” or “the orderly conduct of instructional, recreational, or other\nschool activities.”  Id.  Indeed, even the only arguably “objective” component of this construction\n–  “so as to hinder or impede”  –  is also relatively subjective.  A violation of the Loitering Ordinance\nis classified in penal terms, resulting in maximum penalties of a $500.00 fine, or sixty days in the\nCounty Jail.  See id.\nPlaintiffs contend their members’ activities at the April Protest, as well as their likely activities\nat future demonstrations fall within the reach of the Loitering Ordinance.  The undersigned agrees.\nSince the Loitering Ordinance lacks virtually any objective standards regarding its application, every\nparticipant in a public demonstration, or indeed anyone using a public right of way, may be deemed\nto be in violation of the ordinance and be subjected to its stated penalties.  Indeed, in the context of\na demonstration like the April Protest, where the streets and sidewalks surrounding the MDC campus\nwere filled with demonstrators, it is a virtual certainty that Plaintiffs’ members could be deemed\n“guilty” of hindering or impeding pedestrians and traffic. \nAlthough none of the Plaintiffs’ members have actually been prosecuted under the Loitering\nOrdinance, “[t]he Supreme Court has accepted imminent harm as satisfying the injury-in-fact\nrequirement of Article III standing.”  Florida State Conference of N.A.A.C.P. v. Browning, 522 F.3d\n1153, 1160-61 (11th Cir. 2008) (citing Babbitt v. United Farm Workers National Union, 442 U.S.\n289, 298 (1979)).  Moreover, “‘[i]mminence’ as a doctrinal standard is ‘somewhat elastic,’” and is\nintended to ensure that the threatened injury is not too speculative.  Id. (citing Lujan, 504 U.S. at 564\nn.2).  The undersigned is unpersuaded by the County’s assurances that the Loitering Ordinance has\nbeen rarely, if ever, enforced against protestors in the past (see Diers Decl. ¶ at 13), particularly in\n11\n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 81      Entered on FLSD Docket 06/04/2008     Page 12 of 21\nCase No.  07-21088-CIV-ALTONAGA/Brown\nthe  context  of  this  facial  challenge.    As  discussed,  virtually  every  public  demonstration  in\nunincorporated Miami-Dade County will involve a violation of the Loitering Ordinance, and there is\nnothing preventing the County from enforcing the ordinance at future demonstrations.  Moreover,\nPlaintiffs have identified specific future planned public demonstrations, including one to coincide with\nthe November 2008 election.  Plaintiffs’ members are subject to imminent harm from any future\napplication of the Loitering Ordinance and they consequently have individual standing to sue. \nCiting the Eleventh Circuit’s decision in White’s Place, Inc. v. Glover, 222 F.3d 1327, 1330\n(11th Cir. 2000), the County also contends that Plaintiffs lack associational standing to challenge the\nLoitering Ordinance because the interests they seek to vindicate are not germane to each of the\norganizations’ purposes.  In White’s Place, the court premised its decision upon the fact that the\nplaintiff, a corporation operating a club offering erotic dancing, did not have a substantial interest in\nchallenging an ordinance that prohibited individuals from opposing a police officer, absent “[t]he\nparticipation of an individual employee who has been threatened with arrest.”  Id.  The undersigned\nfinds White’s Place inapposite to the instant matter.  In contrast to the plaintiff in White’s Place, one\nof Plaintiffs’ primary activities is the planning and execution of public demonstrations.  Accordingly,\nthe interests of each of these organizations in opposing the Loitering Ordinance are very closely\naligned with the interests of their members.  See, e.g., Browning, 522 F.3d at 1165-66 (holding that\nNAACP had associational standing to challenge  voter registration statute on behalf of its members).\nFinally, Plaintiffs’ members’ participation is unnecessary for purposes of this facial challenge.\nAccordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have standing to challenge the Loitering Ordinance.\n12\n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 81      Entered on FLSD Docket 06/04/2008     Page 13 of 21\nCase No.  07-21088-CIV-ALTONAGA/Brown\nC.  Constitutionality of the Permit Ordinance\nPlaintiffs assert the Permit Ordinance is unconstitutionally overbroad in that it fails to\narticulate specific standards for the granting of parade permits, and thereby provides the County\nofficial in charge of its administration with unfettered discretion.  Generally, a party making a facial\nchallenge to a statute or ordinance on a constitutional basis must demonstrate that there are no\ncircumstances under which the statute or ordinance would be valid.  See U.S. v. Salerno, 481 U.S.\n739,  745  (1987).    However,  the  Supreme  Court  has  “acknowledged  an  exception  to  the\n‘unconstitutional-in-every-conceivable-application’ rule in cases involving the overbreadth doctrine\nin ‘the limited context of the First Amendment.’”  Horton v. City of St. Augustine, Fla., 272 F.3d\n1318, 1331 (11th Cir. 2001) (quoting Salerno, 481 U.S. at 745). \nIn the instant case, Plaintiffs contend that the Permit Ordinance is a prior restraint which\ninfringes their First Amendment rights.  “A prior restraint on speech prohibits or censors speech\nbefore it can take place.”  Cooper v. Dillon, 403 F.3d 1208, 1215 (11th Cir. 2005) (citing Alexander\nv. U.S., 509 U.S. 544, 553 (1993)).  One such type of prior restraint occurs “where the government\nhas unbridled discretion to limit access to a particular public forum.”  Id. (citing U.S. v. Frandsen,\n212 F.3d 1231, 1236-37 (11th Cir. 2000) (finding prior restraint where a National Park Service\nlicensing scheme gave park official unlimited power to grant or deny permits to protest in the park)).\n“Although there is a ‘heavy presumption’ against the validity of a prior restraint . . . [a] government,\nin order to regulate competing uses of public forums, may impose a permit requirement on those\nwishing to hold a march, parade, or rally . . . .”  Forsyth County, Ga. v. Nationalist Movement, 505\nU.S. 123, 130 (1992) (internal citations omitted).  “Such a scheme, however, must meet certain\n13\n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 81      Entered on FLSD Docket 06/04/2008     Page 14 of 21\nCase No.  07-21088-CIV-ALTONAGA/Brown\nconstitutional requirements.”  Id.  For instance, “[i]t may not delegate overly broad licensing\ndiscretion to a government official.”  Id. (citing Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U.S. 51, 56 (1965)). \nWith respect to a licensing scheme, “the prior restraint of a license, without narrow, objective,\nand definite standards to guide the licensing authority, is unconstitutional.”  Shuttlesworth v. City of\nBirmingham, Ala., 394 U.S. 147, 151 (1969).  An ordinance which “‘makes the peaceful enjoyment\nof freedoms which the Constitution guarantees contingent upon the uncontrolled will of an official\n–  as by requiring a permit or license which may be granted or withheld in the discretion of such\nofficial  – is an unconstitutional censorship or prior restraint upon the enjoyment of those freedoms.’”\nId. (quoting Staub v. City of Baxley, 355 U.S. 313, 322 (1957)).\nThe Permit Ordinance provides “no narrow, objective, and definite standards,” or indeed any\nstandards at all regarding the issuance of parade permit.  See Shuttlesworth, 394 U.S. at 151.  Instead,\nit states simply that “no procession or parade, excepting the forces of the United States Armed\nServices, the military forces of the state, and the forces of the police and fire departments, and funeral\nprocessions, shall occupy, march, or proceed along the street or roadway except in accordance with\na permit issued by the sheriff.”  Miami Dade Code § 30-274.  It does not provide any criteria for the\nsheriff or other County official to consider in determining whether a license should be granted, nor\ndoes it state any reason justifying a denial of a permit request.  It does not apprise the applicant of\nwhat the criteria are guiding the sheriff’s decision to issue or not issue a permit.  Moreover, there is\nno time limit set forth in the Permit Ordinance for the County official to consider a permit request,\nand no provision is made for any type of review or appeal of an adverse decision.  \n14\n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 81      Entered on FLSD Docket 06/04/2008     Page 15 of 21\nCase No.  07-21088-CIV-ALTONAGA/Brown\nThe County has submitted that Plaintiffs were denied a permit for the April Protest because\nof “congestion” and “serious security and public safety problems.”  (Diers Decl. at ¶ 5).  None of the\nCounty’s stated criteria for denying Plaintiffs’ application, however, appear anywhere in the Permit\nOrdinance.  We are left simply to assume the benevolence and good intentions of the sheriff in\ndenying the application.  Interestingly, the Ordinance makes no mention of security or safety concerns\nat all.  Notwithstanding the County’s assertions regarding its reasons for denying Plaintiffs’ permit\napplication, the Court must “analyze [the ordinance] as written.”  Redner v. Dean, 29 F.3d 1495,\n1501 (11th Cir. 1994).  This is because it is not reasonable to “depend on the individuals responsible\nfor enforcing [an] Ordinance to do so in a manner that cures it of constitutional infirmities.”  Id.  On\na facial challenge, therefore, the County’s explanations regarding the criteria it applied to Plaintiffs’\npermit application are irrelevant.  The Court must rely on the text of the Ordinance.  \nIn any event, even assuming the County had applied a written standard of “public safety” to\ndeny Plaintiffs’ application, that would not be sufficient by itself to cure the constitutional defect.\nIndeterminate standards like “public safety” are generally insufficient to satisfy the limited discretion\nrequirement.  See Shuttlesworth, 394 U.S. at 150-51 (holding that an ordinance directing public\nofficials to grant licenses where the proposed expression is consistent with “public welfare, peace,\nsafety, health, decency, good order, morals or convenience” was too amorphous to meaningfully limit\npublic officials’ discretion).  Similarly, the County’s assertion that a permit is not required for First\nAmendment demonstrations (see Diers Decl. at ¶ 8), and that Plaintiffs were not denied a permit on\nthe basis of their message is also unavailing since “the success of a facial challenge on the grounds\nthat an ordinance delegates overly broad discretion to the decisionmaker rests not on whether the\n15\n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 81      Entered on FLSD Docket 06/04/2008     Page 16 of 21\nCase No.  07-21088-CIV-ALTONAGA/Brown\nadministrator has exercised his discretion in a content-based manner, but whether there is anything\nin the ordinance preventing him from doing so.”  Forsyth, 505 U.S. at 133 n.10.  No such restriction\nexists in the Permit Ordinance.\nSignificant to the present analysis, the Permit Ordinance lacks any procedural safeguards.\n“[A]ny system of censorship that runs the risk of suppressing constitutionally protected expression\nmust contain three procedural safeguards designed to obviate the dangers of censorship: (1) the\nburden of going to court to suppress the speech and the burden of proof once in court must lie with\nthe censor; (2) any restraint prior to a judicial determination may only be for a specified brief time\nperiod in order to preserve the status quo; and (3) an avenue for prompt judicial review of the\ncensor’s decision must be available.”  Redner, 29 F.3d at 1500 (citing Freedman, 380 U.S. at 58-59).\nThe Permit Ordinance clearly lacks the second and third procedural safeguards set forth by the\nSupreme Court.  It provides no time limit for the County to make a determination regarding the\nissuance of a permit, and thereby “risks the suppression of protected expression for an indefinite time\nperiod prior to any action on the part of the decisionmaker or any judicial determination.”  Id. at\n1501.  Similarly, there is no provision in the statute for prompt, meaningful judicial review of the\nCounty’s decision to deny a permit.  See Bourgeois v. Peters, 387 F.3d 1303, 1319-20 (11th Cir.\n2004) (“‘[P]rompt judicial review must be available to correct erroneous denials’ of access to\nexpression.”) (quoting Cafe Erotica of Fla., Inc. v. St. John’s County, 360 F.3d 1274, 1283 (11th\nCir. 2004)).  In view of the unrestricted discretion provided to the County official issuing or not\nissuing the parade permits, and the lack of required procedural safeguards, the undersigned concludes\nthe Permit Ordinance is constitutionally overbroad.\n16\n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 81      Entered on FLSD Docket 06/04/2008     Page 17 of 21\nCase No.  07-21088-CIV-ALTONAGA/Brown\nPlaintiffs also contend the Permitting Ordinance is unconstitutional because it is not a content-\nneutral time, place, and manner regulation.  It is well established that, “any permit scheme controlling\nthe time, place, and manner of speech must not be based on the content of the message, must be\nnarrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, and must leave open ample alternatives\nfor communication.”  Forsyth, 505 U.S. at 130 (citing United States v. Grace, 461 U.S. 171, 177\n(1983)).  The Permit Ordinance provides exceptions from its permit requirement for “the forces of\nthe United States Armed Services, the military forces of the state, and the forces of the police and fire\ndepartments, and funeral processions . . . .”  Miami Dade Code § 30-274.  Although the undersigned\nis not persuaded by the County’s argument that the Permit Ordinance is content-neutral, a further\ninquiry is unnecessary since “[e]ven a facially content-neutral time, place, and manner regulation may\nnot  vest  public  officials  with  unbridled  discretion  over  permitting  decisions.”    Burk  v.\nAugusta-Richmond County, 365 F.3d 1247, 1256 (11th Cir. 2004) (citations omitted).  A content-\nneutral ordinance must still “contain adequate standards to guide the official’s decision and render\nit subject to effective judicial review.”  Thomas v. Chicago Park Dist., 534 U.S. 316, 323 (2002)\n(citing Niemotko v. State of Md., 340 U.S. 268, 271 (1951)).  As discussed, the Permit Ordinance\nfails to sufficiently limit the sheriff or County official’s discretion in granting permits, and fails to\nprovide the required constitutional safeguards.    Accordingly, it is constitutionally overbroad\nregardless of whether or not it is deemed to be content-neutral.\nD.  Constitutionality of the Loitering Ordinance\nPlaintiffs challenge the Loitering Ordinance on the ground that it is unconstitutionally vague.\n“[T]he void-for-vagueness doctrine requires that a penal statute define the criminal offense with\n17\n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 81      Entered on FLSD Docket 06/04/2008     Page 18 of 21\nCase No.  07-21088-CIV-ALTONAGA/Brown\nsufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner\nthat does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.”  Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S.\n352, 357 (1983) (citations omitted).  Thus, “[v]agueness may invalidate a criminal law for either of\ntwo independent reasons.”  City of Chicago v. Morales, 527 U.S. 41, 56 (1999) (holding that\nloitering ordinance which required a police officer, on observing a person whom he reasonably\nbelieved to be a street gang member loitering in any public place with one or more other persons, to\norder all such persons to disperse, and made failure to obey such an order a violation, was\nunconstitutionally vague).  “First, it may fail to provide the kind of notice that will enable ordinary\npeople to understand what conduct it prohibits; second, it may authorize and even encourage arbitrary\nand discriminatory enforcement.”  Id. (citing Kolender, 461 U.S. at 357).  The Loitering Ordinance\nis constitutionally vague for both of these reasons.  \nThe plain text of the Loitering Ordinance, specifically its use of the phrase “hinder or impede,”\ncriminalizes an extremely broad variety of activities on a public right of way, including simply\nstanding on a sidewalk, and criminalizes virtually all behavior likely to take place at a public\ndemonstration.  This broad language makes it exceedingly hard to discern exactly what conduct is\nprohibited.  Indeed, at least one Florida court has long ago held that a loitering statute utilizing a\nsimilar “hinder or impede” construction as the County’s Loitering Ordinance was unconstitutionally\nvague.  See Ciccarelli v. City of Key West, 321 So. 2d 472, 474 (Fla. 3d DCA 1975) (concluding that\na valid loitering statute using such language “must contain some restrictive standards which would\nlimit its application to impediments to passage that threaten public safety or a breach of the peace.”).\n18\n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 81      Entered on FLSD Docket 06/04/2008     Page 19 of 21\nCase No.  07-21088-CIV-ALTONAGA/Brown\nSecond, the lack of any objective standards for determining when an individual is in violation\nof the Ordinance raises the likelihood of its arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement.  As discussed,\nthe undersigned is not persuaded by the County’s assertion that the Loitering Ordinance is rarely, if\never, enforced (see Diers Decl. at ¶ 13), as this does little to mitigate the fact that there is nothing\nto preclude its enforcement against Plaintiffs’ members absent a permanent injunction.  For all of\nthese reasons, the Court concludes that the Loitering Ordinance is unconstitutionally vague.  Having\nconcluded that the Loitering Ordinance is unconstitutionally vague, the undersigned declines to\nconsider Plaintiffs’ other constitutional challenges to the Ordinance.3\nE.  Entitlement to a Permanent Injunction\nA district court may grant permanent injunctive relief if the moving party demonstrates: (1)\nactual success on the merits; (2) irreparable injury will be suffered unless the injunction issues; (3) the\nthreatened injury to the movant outweighs whatever damage the proposed injunction may cause the\nopposing party; and (4) if issued, the injunction would not be adverse to the public interest.  KH\nOutdoor, LLC v. City of Trussville, 458 F.3d 1261, 1268 (11th Cir. 2006).  As to first prong,\nPlaintiffs have demonstrated actual success on the merits of their claims that the Permit Ordinance\nand the Loitering Ordinance are unconstitutional.  \nAs to the second prong, “‘[t]he loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods\nof time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.’”  KH Outdoor, LLC, 458 F.3d at 1271-72\n(quoting Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976)).  Thus, having demonstrated that the ordinances\n3  Plaintiffs also challenge the Loitering Ordinance on the grounds that it is constitutionally overbroad and\nviolates Plaintiffs’ liberty interest. \n19\n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 81      Entered on FLSD Docket 06/04/2008     Page 20 of 21\nCase No.  07-21088-CIV-ALTONAGA/Brown\nhave subjected them to a deprivation of their First Amendment rights, Plaintiffs have made a showing\nof irreparable injury.  \nSimilarly, Plaintiffs have shown the equities are in their favor.  See id. at 1268.  While\nPlaintiffs have shown that the future application of the Permit Ordinance and the Loitering Ordinance\nmay subject them to the deprivation of their constitutional rights, the County has not articulated any\nhardship it will suffer as a result of the injunctive relief sought by Plaintiffs.\nFinally, “[t]he public has no interest in enforcing an unconstitutional ordinance.”  KH\nOutdoor, LLC, 458 F.3d at 1272 (citations omitted); see also Joelner v. Vill. of Washington Park,\n378 F.3d 613, 620 (7th Cir. 2004) (“[T]here can be no irreparable harm to a municipality when it is\nprevented from enforcing an unconstitutional statute[.]”) (internal quotation marks and citations\nomitted)).    In  light  of  the  undersigned’s  determination  that  the  challenged  ordinances  are\nunconstitutional, Plaintiffs have also satisfied the final element for a permanent injunction.  For all of\nthese reasons, Plaintiffs are entitled to a permanent injunction against enforcement of the Permit and\nLoitering Ordinances.4\nIII.  CONCLUSION\nIn accordance with the foregoing, it is ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that Plaintiffs’\nMotion [D.E. 60] is GRANTED.  A permanent injunction is issued prohibiting the County from\nfuture enforcement or application of Miami Dade Code Sections 30-274 (the Permit Ordinance) and\n4  On April 16, 2008, the County filed a Motion to Stay [D.E. 68], notifying the Court it was in the process\nof revising its Code in the wake of mediation and requesting an abatement of the proceedings in this matter.  That\nMotion was denied in an Order [D.E. 70] dated April 17, 2008.  The permanent injunction shall apply only to the\ncurrent versions of the Permit and Loitering Ordinances.  \n20\n\nCase 1:07-cv-21088-CMA     Document 81      Entered on FLSD Docket 06/04/2008     Page 21 of 21\nCase No.  07-21088-CIV-ALTONAGA/Brown\n21-31.1 (the Loitering Ordinance).  The parties are further ordered to schedule a mediation by June\n25, 2008, and submit their report of mediation results within five days thereafter.  The mediation is\nto address the remaining issues of attorney’s fees and any compensatory damages.  \nThis case is removed from the Court’s trial calendar.  The parties’ Joint Motion Filed Out of\nTime for Extension of Time to Submit Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law [D.E. 79]\nis DENIED as moot. \nDONE AND ORDERED in Chambers at Miami, Florida, this 4th day of June, 2008.\n   \n         _________________________________\n     CECILIA M.
