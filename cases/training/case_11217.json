    "summary": "<p>On May 2, 2008, the Parents' League for Effective Autism Services (PLEAS), along with three autistic children with autism who received medically necessary services funded by Medicaid, filed this suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, against the Director of the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services and the Director of the Ohio Department of Mental Health. The suit was brought under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 and alleged violations of plaintiffs' rights under federal Medicaid law. Plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief to prevent the loss or reduction of medically necessary services.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs claimed that amendments to Ohio administrative rules (O.A.C. &sect;&sect; 5101:3-27-02 and 5122-29-17, which were scheduled to be effective July 1, 2008) promulgated by the defendants would deprive the plaintiffs of services required by the federal Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) program. The federal requirements for EPSDT require states to provide \"such other necessary health care, diagnostic services, treatment, and other measures to correct or to ameliorate defects and physical and mental illnesses and conditions discovered by the screening services, whether or not such services are covered under the State plan.\" 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1396d(r)(5). Further, the Medicaid Act required states to fund \"preventive and rehabilitative services, including any medical or remedial services recommended by a physician . . . for the maximum reduction of physical or mental disability and restoration of an individual to the best possible functional level[.]\" 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1396d(a)(13).</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs received physician-recommended services including \"full day center-based applied behavior analysis, psychological assessments and diagnosis, parent advocacy and resource information and home outreach services including one-to-one services,\" which plaintiffs characterized as rehabilitative and resulting in the \"maximum reduction of physical and mental disabilities and restoration to the best possible functional level.\" Under the new rules promulgated by the defendants, only services that were rehabilitative, rather than services that were ameliorative or that prevented deterioration, would available to Medicaid recipients. The rules also would restrict the definition of certain rehabilitative services, including applied behavioral analysis, so that they would only to patients whose diagnoses were categorized as \"mental illness,\" a grouping that did not include autism and related diagnoses.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs sought injunctions ordering the defendants to continue or begin providing 35-40 hours of applied behavioral analysis services to the plaintiff children. They sought orders enjoining the defendants from enforcing the new rules, and requiring them to develop new rules that complied with federal Medicaid law. That sought declarations that the rules violated the plaintiff's rights and that they were unlawful. Plaintiffs also sought attorney's fees and legal costs.</p>\r\n<p>On June 20, 2008, the Court (Judge James L. Graham) ordered that, pursuant a motion filed by the defendants and to Fed. R. Civ. 19(a), the plaintiffs file an amended complaint, adding as a necessary defendant the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, the federal agency responsible for approving state Medicaid plans. The amended complaint was filed on June 24, 2008.</p>\r\n<p>On June 30, 2008, the Court found that the plaintiffs had standing to bring the suit and denied the Defendants' motion to dismiss the case. Parents League for Effective Autism Servs. v. Jones-Kelley, 565 F. Supp. 2d 895 (S.D. Ohio 2008). On the same day, the Court issued a separate opinion granting the plaintiffs' motions for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction preventing the State from implementing the amendments to O.A.C. &sect;&sect; 5101:3-27-02 and 5122-29-17, finding that the plaintiffs case had a strong likelihood of success on the merits, and that the plaintiffs would likely suffer irrevocable harm if the rules were to go into effect. Parents League for Effective Autism Servs. v. Jones-Kelley, 565 F.Supp.2d 905 (S.D.Ohio 2008).</p>\r\n<p>The defendants appealed this decision and filed a motion for stay of the proceedings before the District Court and a stay of the preliminary injunction, pending the outcome of the appeal. On July 17, 2008, Judge Graham granted the motion to stay proceedings, but left the preliminary injunction in place. Parents League for Effective Autism Servs. v. Jones-Kelley, 2008 WL 2796744 (S.D. Ohio 2008).</p>\r\n<p>On July 29, 2009, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals (Judge John M. Rogers) affirmed the District Court's grant of the preliminary injunction. Parents' League for Effective Autism Servs. v. Jones-Kelley, 339 F. App'x 542 (6th Cir. 2009). On September 18, 2009, the District Court referred the case to mediation. Two years later, on September 14, 2011, the parties informed the court that they had reached a settlement, and requested that the preliminary injunction and restraining order be lifted. The Court dissolved the restraining order and injunction the next day. On December 15, 2011, the parties filed a joint stipulation requesting the dismissal of the case with prejudice, which specified that the defendants had fulfilled their obligations under the settlement. The court dismissed the case.</p>\r\n<p>The terms of the settlement do not appear to have been made public. According to the Ohio Disability Rights Law and Policy Center (Disability Rights Ohio) website, the settlement \"[r]equires maintaining [the prior rules] that [do] not restrict services based on cognitive ability or recovery of lost skills; Authorizes [the filing of] a new rule that implements a prior authorization process for more than 104 hours of CPST services per year; Exempts 123 PLEAS member children and settlement beneficiaries from the prior authorization process for CPST services until those children reach age 21, and; Reimburses plaintiffs' attorneys' fees.\" See their summary of the case at <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160714083003/https://www.disabilityrightsohio.org/legal-library/pleas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http://www.disabilityrightsohio.org/legal-library/pleas</a> for more information.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

In so ruling, the Court is not deciding \nthat  all  of  the  services  provided  by  SBSA  are \nmedically necessary nor that the cost of treatment as \nbilled by SBSA is reasonable. Rather, the Court is \nsimply holding that the Plaintiffs have a reasonable \nchance of being successful in establishing that ABA \nservices  are  covered  by  Medicaid  and  that  the \namendments to the Ohio Administrative Code violate \nthe federal Medicaid Act. \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n \nS.D.Ohio,2008. \nParents  League  for  Effective  Autism  Services  v. \nJones-Kelley \n565 F.Supp.2d 905, 70 Fed.R.Serv.3d 1487, Med & \nMed GD (CCH) P 302,458 \n \nEND OF DOCUMENT \n \n ",

Children who are eligible for \nMedicaid are entitled to any federally authorized Medicaid service, whether or not those services \nare included in the State's Medicaid plan. 42 U.S.c. § 1396(d)(r)(5). Under the federal Early and \nPeriodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) mandate, all states must furnish \nappropriate medically necessary treatment to correct or ameliorate defects and physical and \nmental illnesses and conditions. 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(r)(5). Medicaid-eligible individuals under the \nage of21 who are screened and diagnosed with physical, behavioral, emotional or psychiatric \ndisabilities must receive medically necessary preventive, corrective and rehabilitative treatment. \nPlaintiffs are made up of parents and families and children. Plaintiff children are \nMedicaid eligible and have been diagnosed with a developmental disability on the autism \nspectrum. Plaintiff children currently receive medically necessary community mental health \nservices from Step By Step Academy (SBSA) under Ohio's Medicaid program. Plaintiffs have \nnot found any other provider that offers a program of similar scope, duration and intensity to that \n\noffered by SBSA. Defendants have promulgated rules, effective July 1, 2008, which govern the \nMedicaid program in Ohio and will change the provisions related to community mental health \nservices, O.A.C. §§ 5101:3-27-02 and 5122-29-17. The changes will reduce the services that are \ncurrently provided to Plaintiff children. Once these rules are effective, Plaintiff children will be \ndenied medically necessary services in violation of the federal EPSDT mandate. \nPursuant to Rule 65(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and S.D. Ohio Civ. R. \n65.1, Plaintiffs through undersigned counsel respectfully move this Court for a temporary \nrestraining order enjoining Defendants from enforcing their proposed rules and from restricting \nthe services provided under Medicaid based on Defendants' limited definition of 'rehabilitative' \nservices. Counsel acknowledges that the Court ordinarily does not grant motions for a temporary \nrestraining order until after the Court holds a preliminary conference with the parties; therefore, \nplaintiffs request, in the alternative, that the Court schedule a preliminary conference with the \nparties pursuant to S.D. Ohio Civ. R. 65.1. \nPlaintiffs will suffer immediate and irreparable harm if a temporary restraining order is \nnot granted because they will be denied necessary services, most likely suffer a decline in \nprogress and an increase in unwanted behaviors and face unnecessary institutionalization. \nIn support of this Motion, Plaintiffs rely upon their Memorandum in Support of \nPlaintiffs' Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and the attached declarations which are \nattached to and made part of this Motion. \nRespectfully submitted, \nMichelle F.

Background and Facts \nPlaintiff children are all Medicaid eligible and are under the age of twenty-one. Plaintiff \nchildren have all been diagnosed with a developmental disability on the autism spectrum. Autism \nis a medical disorder characterized by an inability to interact socially, repetitive behavior and \nlanguage dysfunction. Hummel v. ODJFS, 164 Ohio App. 3d 776 (Ohio ct. App. 2005). It is a \ncomplex neurodevelopmental disability that generally appears during the first three years oflife \nwhich impacts the normal development of the brain, resulting in impairments of social \ninteraction, verbal and non-verbal and communication, leisure or play activities, learning and \nmost often if untreated results in lifelong mental retardation. (Ex. I, Mulick Decl. '!r 7). Autism is \nnow seen as a spectrum disorder, \"Autism Spectrum Disorder\" (ASD). (Ex. 1, MuIiek Dec!. .. 9). \nAutistic disorder, the full-blown condition, is one of five disorders falling under the umbrella of \n\"Pervasive Developmental Disorder\" (PDD). (Ex. I, Mulick Dec!. ~ 9). PDD also includes the \ndisorders commonly diagnosed as Asperger's Disorder, Ret! Syndrome, Childhood \nDisintegrative Disorder and PDD-Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS). (Ex. 1, Mulick Dec!. ~ \n3 \n\n9). It is estimated that nearly thirty children who will be diagnosed with some fonn of autism \nspectrum disorder are born every year in Franklin County, Ohio. (Ex. I, Mulick DecL ,  12). \nPreviously, parents of children with autism were encouraged to place their child into \ninstitutional care to spare the family the stress and heartache of attempting to raise tbeir child. \n(Ex. I, Mulick Dec!. ~ 10). Research demonstrates that by providing the child with autism \nappropriate services and supports at appropriate developmental levels, significant gains in most \nlife areas can be achieved. (Ex. 1, Mulick Dec!. ,  11). Research also shows that almost half of \nthe children that receive applied behavior analysis (ABA) treatment will become \n\"indistinguishable among their peers\" and can be mainstreamed back into the regular school \nenvironment and that children maintain these outcomes post therapy and into their teens. (Ex. 8, \nLaMarche Dec!. ,  A). ABA uses a one-on-one teaching technique that relies on reinforced \npractice of various skills. (Ex. 1, Mulick Dec!. '21). Children with autism need  a highly \nstructured, consistent environment that is rich in planned reinforcement of targeted skills and \nbehaviors. (Ex. 5, Christiansen Dec!. ,  11). ABA is highly effective form of behavioral treatment \nin virtually all cases of autism. (Ex. I, Mulick Dec!., 21). \nPlaintiff children receive medically necessary services at Step by Step Academy (SBSA) \nlocated in Worthington, Ohio under Ohio's Medicaid program. SBSA is a nationally accredited \nand state certified community mental health agency dedicated to providing mental health \nserv ices to children with autism. Services provided by SBSA include: full day, year round, \ncenter-based ABA, psychological assessments and diagnosis, parent advocacy and resource \ninfonnation, home outreach services including I: I and lead trainer services, school transition and \nconsultation services and parent and professional trainings. By receiving these services from \nSBSA, Plaintiff children have experienced a reduction in their developmental disabilities and \n4 \n\nrestoration toward their best possible functional level. (Ex. 5, Christiansen Dec1. 'lI13; Ex. 9, \nRosner Dec\\.).  Plaintiffs have not found any other provider which offers services of similar \nscope, duration and intensity. (Ex. 2, A.C. Dec\\. 'lI22; Ex. 3, K.G. 'lI16; Ex. 4, A.W. Dec!. 'lI21). \nPlaintiff Parents' League for Effective Autism Services (PLEAS) is an association of \nparents and families and children who receive services from SBSA under Medicaid. Membership \nof PLEAS includes both named Plaintiffs and other parents, families and children not \nindividually named in this complaint. \nIf Plaintiff PLEAS children do not receive intensive, one-to-one or small group ABA \nbased intervention program they will likely regress and withdraw further into their world of \nautism by resorting to their earlier patterns of maladaptive, stereotyped behaviors. (Ex. 5, \n'1 \nChristiansen Dee!.  7-8; Ex. 9, Rosner Dec!.). PLEAS children will most likely have a difficult \ntime acquiring new skills with the absence of one-to-one, ABA based intervention. (Ex. 5, \nChristiansen Dec!. 'lI9; Ex. 9, Rosner Dec!.). PLEAS children will suffer an increase in \ninappropriate or dangerous behaviors which could result in injury to themselves or others. (Ex. 5, \nChristiansen Dec!. 'lI8; Ex. 9, Rosner Dec!.). lfthe court does not grant their request for a TRO, \nPlaintiff PLEAS parents and families face a loss or reduction in funding of these services and \nwill be unable to afford these medically necessary services for their children. Individually named \nchildren face similar harm. \nPlaintiff X.C. is a six year old boy who was first diagnosed with autism at eighteen \nmonths old. (Ex. 2, A.C. Dec!. 1 2). X.c. lives in Logan, Ohio. (Ex. 2, A.C. Decl. 1 2). He \nreceives 35-40 hours per week of one-to-one intensive behavioral therapy from SBSA. (Ex. 2, \nA.C. Decl. 'f: 4). Socially, x.c. was withdrawn and did not acknowledge others when they talked \nto him and he avoided peers. (Ex. 9, Rosner Dec!.). X.C. has a history of inattention, tantrums \n5 \n\nand dangerous behaviors. (Ex. 2, A C. Dec!' .-9). He continues to be impulsive, aggressive, \nstubborn and have tantrums. (Ex. 2, A.C. Dec!' '\\19). During tantrums, X.C. typically screams, \nkicks, throws objects, bangs his head on the floor and rips blankets with his leeth. (Ex. 2, AC. \nDec!. '\\113). \nSince receiving services from SBSA, X.C. has made progress in cognitive and adaptive \nbehavior goals and has reduced tantrums, aggression and elopement. (Ex. 9, Rosner Decl.). \nX,C.'s communication skills have greatly improved, (Ex. 2, AC. Dec!' ~ 16). XC, now uses his \nmother's name or taps his mother's shoulder to get her attention. (Ex, 2, A.C. Dec!. '\\116). When \nX.C, is not receiving services from SBSA his behaviors worsen, tantrums become more frequent \nand he regresses in skills. (Ex, 2, AC, Dec!. 'l1'li17-18), SBSA's center-based program is \nnecessary for X.C. because other service providers have stated that they are not appropriate due \nto X.C.'s severe behaviors. (Ex, 2, A.C. Dec!. '\\1'\\119, 21). X.C. requires the structure of an \nintensive behavioral program in order to leam new skills and keep unsafe behaviors at a \nmanageable leve!. (Ex. 9, Rosner Dec!.). \nPlaintiffW.G, is a six year old boy who was first diagnosed with autism at two years old, \n(Ex. 3, KG. Dec!. '\\12). W.G. lives in Westerville, Ohio. (Ex. 3, K.G. Dec!. '\\12). He receives 35-\n40 hours per week of one-to-one intensive behavioral therapy from SBSA. (Ex. 3, KG. Decl. '\\I \n4). W.G. is not afraid of anything, is unaware of potential dangers and has a tendency to wander \naway. (Ex. 3, KG. Dec!. '\\17). Ifleft unattended, W.G. eats non-food items including soap, \nlotion, play-dough and paint. (Ex. 3, KG. Dec!. ~ 9). W.G. has many repetitive behaviors \nincluding finger flicking, clapping, tapping objects and jumping. (Ex. 3, K.G. Decl. '\\Ill). \nW.G. has severe delays in expressive and receptive language. (Ex. 3, K.G. Dec!. '\\16), \nSince receiving services from SBSA, W,G. has made progress in his prompted language. (Ex, 3, \n6 \n\nK.G. Dec!. '116). When W.G. is not receiving services from SBSA, his behavior regresses and he \nhas a difficult time focusing. (Ex. 3, KG. Dec!. '1112). W.G. will not receive the services he \nneeds in another setting because other settings do not offer the intensity, structure, supervision \nand individualized services. (Ex. 3, K.G. Dec!. '11'1114-15). \nPlaintiffK.W. is a seven year old boy who was first diagnosed with autism at two years \nn \nold. KW.lives in Westerville, Ohio. (Ex. 4, A.W. Dec!.  2-3). He receives 35-40 hours per \nweek of one-to-one intensive behavioral therapy from SBSA. (Ex. 4, A. W. Decl. '114). He has \nfrequent stubbornness, low frustration tolerance and repetitive and compulsive behaviors. (Ex. 4, \nA.W. Dec!. '11'1112-14). His expressive and receptive language skills are severely delayed. (Ex. 4, \nA.W. Decl. '117). \nWhen KW. is not receiving services from SBSA his behaviors escalate and become more \nfrequent. (Ex. 4, A.W. Dec!. '1117). He will self-stimulate more often, have a shorter attention \nspan and pick up items and watch them fall with more frequency. (Ex. 4, A.W. Dec!. '1117). Prior \nto attending SBSA, KW. was in a classroom in Worthington City Schools.  (Ex. 4, A.W. DecL '11 \n18). There was not a one-to-one aide to engage him in learning activities, and as a result K.W. \nwas often left alone ifhe was not causing distraction or exhibiting dangerous behaviors and he \ndid not have any interaction with others. (Ex. 4, A.W. Decl. '1119). Returning to Worthington \nCity Schools is not appropriate and would be unsafe for K.W. because he cannot call out for help \nwhen needed, he will follow anyone anywhere regardless of the situation, he does not understand \npersonal space which could lead to confrontations with peers and he cannot follow simple \ndirections to go to a specific destination without someone in attendance. (Ex. 4, A.W. DecL \";:'11 \n15,20). \n7 \n\nDefendant Helen Jones-Kelley is the Director of Ohio Department of Job and Family \nServices (ODJFS). ODJFS is the single state agency for the Medicaid program in Ohio and is \nrequired, pursuant to O.R.C. § 5111.01 and O.A.c. § 5101:1-37-01, to provide medical \nassistance in accordance with the federal Medicaid statute, Title XIX ofthe Social Security Act, \n79 Stat. 286 (1965). \nDefendant Sandra Stephenson is the Director of Ohio Department of Mental Health \n(ODMH). Defendant Stephenson is responsible for adopting rules that establish standards for \nservices provided by community mental health faeilities. \nAs directors, Defendant Jones-Kelley and Defendant Stephenson entered into an inter \nagency agreement between ODJFS and ODMH for the purpose of establishing a sub-recipient \nrelationship between the entities to implement 42 C.F.R. § 431 Part M and to provide behavioral \nhealth services to people who are eligible for Ohio Medieaid benefits under Title XIX of the \nSocial Security Act. Interagency Agreement Between ODJFS and ODMH, Article I, Section A \n(Attached as Ex. 12). ODMH is a sub-recipient of federal funding from ODJFS. \nDefendants, acting in their official capacities, promulgated rules which govern the \nMedicaid program in Ohio. The rules promulgated by Defendants, O.A.C. §§ 5101:3-27-02 and \n5122-29-17, are effective July I, 2008. These rules require that community mental health \nservices including community psychiatric support treatment services be rehabilitative in nature. \n§§ 5101 :3-27-02(A) and 5122-29-17(A) (eff. 7/1108) (Attached as Ex. 6 and Ex. 7 respectively). \nDefendants' define rehabilitative services more narrowly than contemplated under federal law. \nO.A.C. §§ 5101:3-27-02(A) and 5122-29-17(A) (eff. 7/1/08). \nAs explained more fully in section II of this memorandum, Defendants have decided to \nlimit the services to be paid for by Medicaid in violation of federal law. As a result, providers \n8 \n\nauthorized by the state to deliver intensive behavioral health services to Medicaid-eligible \nchildren will lack the authority, capacity and funds required to provide medically necessary, \nongoing, intensive community-based services to the Plaintiff children. \nDue to the Defendants' failure to comply with federal Medicaid provisions Plaintiff \nchildren, who have serious developmental and behavioral disabilities, will lose the community \nmental health services that they currently receive and will face the possibility of unnecessary \nconfinement in residential facilities or other costly institutions even though their medical \nconditions have been successfully addressed in the community under the soon to expire Ohio \nMedicaid rules. \nII.  Argument \nUnder Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b), this court can grant a temporary restraining order ex parte if \nthe plaintiffs present \"specific facts shown by affidavit\" that they will suffer irreparable harm \nduring the time it would take to notifY the defendants and hold a hearing. First Technology \nSafety Systems, Inc. v. Depinet, II F. 3d 641, 649-652 (6th Cir. 1993). \nThis Court must consider four factors in determining whether to grant a temporary \nrestraining order: (1) the likelihood that the plaintiffs will succeed on the merits; (2) whether \nthere is threat of irreparable harm to plaintiffs; (3) the probability that granting the temporary \nrestraining order will cause substantial harm to others; and (4) whether the public interest is \nadvanced by the issuance of the temporary restraining order. These are \"factors to be balanced, \nnot prerequisites that must be met.\" In re DeLorean Motor Co. v. DeLorean, 755 F. 2d 1223, \n1229 (6th Cir. 1985). \nA.  Because Defendants' rules violate federal Medicaid law by reducing medically \nnecessarv services to children, Plaintiffs have a substantial likelihood of success on the \nmerits. \n9 \n\nEvery participating Medicaid state is required to provide Early, Periodic Screening, \nDiagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) services to Medicaid eligible children under the age of2L \nSee Frew v. Hawkins, 540 U.S. 431,433 (2004); 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(l0)(A), 42 U.S.c, § \n1396d(a)(4)(B). The federal requirements ofEPSDT mandate that states provide services \nwhether or not such services are covered under the state plan. 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(r)(5). Under \nEPSDT, states must provide all the services listed in 42 U.s.c, § I 396d(a) when needed to \ncorrect or ameliorate a psychiatric, behavioral or emotional condition. A district court in \nLouisiana found that the \"failure to make behavioral and psychological services available to all \nEPSDT recipients who need them violates the requirement of 42 U.S.C. I 396d(r)(5) that the \ndefendant provide all necessary services within the scope of 42 U.S.C. I 396d(a) necessary to \ncorrect or ameliorate health conditions ofEPSDT recipients.\" Chisholm v. Hood, 133 F. Supp. \n2d 894, 901 (E.D. La. 2001). \nServices currently being provided to children enrolled at SBSA, in conjunction with their \nMedicaid waiver andior education services, result in the maximum reduction of their physical \nand mental disabilities, and restoration of their best possible functional level. (Ex. 5, Christiansen \nDec!. '1]13; Ex. 9, Rosner Decl.). \nThe services provided by SBSA have resulted in numerous benefits to Plaintiff children, \nincluding increased IQ levels, reduction in developmental disabilities, decrease in behavioral \noutbursts, increase in on-task behaviors, decrease in self-stimulation behaviors, increased \ncommunication skills, increased daily living skills such as toileting, dressing, food preparation, \nand a decreased chance of being placed in segregated special education classrooms or \ninstitutional settings. (Ex. 5, Christiansen Dec!. '1]'1]7-9; Ex. 8, LaMarche Ded; Ex. 9, Rosner \nDecl.; Ex. 2, A.C. Decl. W 15-16; Ex. 3, K.G. '1]6). \n10 \n\nSBSA has received Medicaid reimbursement for services provided to Plaintiff children \nunder current rule O.A. C. § 5122-29-17 (eff. 8/23/07) which provides community psychiatric \nsupportive treatment (CPST). (Attached as Ex. 10). These services focus on the \"individual's \nability to succeed in the community; to identify and access needed services; and to show \nimprovement in school, work and family and integration and contributions within the \ncommunity.\" OAC. § 5122-29-17(A). Activities ofCPST include \"mental health interventions \nthat address ... behaviors, thought processes, etc., that assist an individual in eliminating barriers \nto seeking or maintaining education ...\"  OAC. § 5122-29-17(B)(9). Additionally, OAC. § \n5101:3-27-02(A)(1) provides that \"behavioral health counseling and therapy services\" are \ncurrently reimbursable as Medicaid community mental health services. O.A. C. § 5101 :3-27-02 \n(eff. 6/l/07) (Attached as Ex. 11). \nIn contrast to the current rules, O.A.c. § 5101 :3-27-02, promulgated by Defendants and \neffective July 1, 2008, lists services that are required to be rehabilitative in nature in order to he \nreimbursable as Medicaid community mental health services. \"Rehabilitative services\" are \ndefined in O.A.C. § 5101 :3-27-02(A)(eff. 7/1/08) as services that \"provide for the maximum \nreduction of mental illness and are intended to restore an individual to the best possible \nfunctional level.\" Listed among the services that are required to be rehabilitative is community \npsychiatric supportive treatment (CPST) service. OAC. § 5101 :3-27-02 (eff. 7/1/08). \"CPST \nservice is a rehabilitative service intended to maximize the reduction of symptoms of mental \nillness in order to restore the individual's functioning to the highest level possible.\" O.A.C. § \n5122-29-17(A) (eff. 711108). The proposed rules will significantly narrow the definition and \neligibility for CPST services. The rules reqnire that the recipient have a \"mental illness\" and \n\"have the cognitive ability to be able to participate and benefit from the service\". O.A.C. § 5122-\n11 \n\n29-l7(A), (B)(l) (eff. 711108). Additionally the rule states that services should \"restore\" an \nindividual. O.A.C. § 51 22-29-1 7(A) (eff. 711108). Similarly, proposed rule O.A.C. § 5101 :3-27-\n02 (eff. 711108) will require that \"community mental health services\" be \"rehabilitative\" and \nprovide \"for the maximum reduction of mental illness.\" \nDefendants are impermissibly and categorically limiting the availability of Medicaid \nservices to otherwise eligible children by disability label and functioning level by limiting the \nscope of rehabilitative services to those that reduce mental illness. These rules fail to incorporate \nadditional federal requirements under EPSDT to provide medically necessary treatment to \n\"correct or ameliorate defects and physical and mental illnesses and conditions\" as required \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a). (Emphasis added). 1fproper services are provided to children with \nautism, those children are able to achieve a higher functioning level, including increased 1Q \nlevels. Autism spectrum disorders are coded under Axis I, the axis used to diagnose clinical \ndisorders, in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ofM  ental Disorders, 4th edition, 1994 CDSM \nN). Diagnoses under Axis I indicate that symptoms of these disorders can be ameliorated and \nfunctioning can be increased with intervention unlike diagnoses under Axis II which are long \nterm and not expected to respond to treatment. The state definition of rehabilitative services is \nclearly more restrictive than federal provisions. \nThe more expansive federal definition of rehabilitative services includes \"any medical or \nremedial service recommended by a physician or other licensed practitioner of the healing arts, \nwithin the scope of his practice under state law for maximum reduction of physical or mental \ndisabilitv .... \" 42 C.F.R. § 440. 130(d) (Emphasis added). Defendants should be enjoined from \nlimiting the defmition of rehabilitative services with regard to Plaintiff children as it violates \nfederal EPSDT requirements. \n12 \n\nPlaintiff children require these services as recommended by their physician or other \nlicensed treatment provider. The medical opinion and diagnosis of a patient's treating physician \nare entitled to substantial, if not complete, deference in determining medical necessity. Holman \nv. Ohio Dept. o/Human Serv., 143 Ohio App. 3d 44, 48 (Ohio Ct. App. 2001), citing King v. \nHeckler, 742 F. 2d 968, 973 (6th Cir. 1984). Defendants have previously and unsuccessfully \nargued that ABA is not a medical service and therefore not a medically necessary service \ncovered under Ohio Medicaid. Hummel v. ODJFS, 164 Ohio App. 3d 776 (Ohio Ct. App. 2005). \nAdditionally, the evidence shows that the services provided to Plaintiff children are \nclearly rehabilitative in nature and are medically necessary. futensive behavioral therapy \nrepresents the treatment modality that provides the maximum reduction of physical and mental \ndisability to achieve autistic children's best possible functional level. (Ex. 1, Mulick Dec!. '1[ 35). \nfutensive behavioral therapy is a rehabilitative service, with both medical and remedial \ncomponents under 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(13). The Medicaid Act gives Plaintiffs an enforceable \nright to intensive behavior therapy services. \nUltimately, it is irrelevant whether Defendants exclude the services provided to the \nPlaintiff children from their overly restrictive definition of \"rehabilitative services\" as long as the \nservices fall within the scope of federal Medicaid. The Eighth Circuit has held that, reading 42 \nl;.S.C. §§ 1396a, 1396d(a) and 1396d(r) together, a state plan need not specifically list every \ntreatment service conceivably available under EPSDT mandate, but the state plan must pay part \nor all of cost of treatments to ameliorate conditions discovered by the screening process when \nthose treatments mect definitions set forth in 42 U.S.C. § 1396a. Pediatric Speciality Care, Inc. \nv. Ark. Dept. o/Human Serv., 293 F. 3d 472 (8th Cir. 2002). Thus, pursuant to the requirements \nofEPSDT, Plaintiff children are entitled to continue receiving intensive behavioral services \n13 \n\nprovided by SBSA through Ohio's current Medicaid rules until such time as Defendants \npromulgate rules that comply with federal law. If this court does not enjoin Defendants from \nimplementing Ohio's new rules, Plaintiff children will not be able to secure medically necessary \nservices to which they are entitled under federal law. \nB.  The issuance of the Temporary Restraining Order will prevent irreparable harm to \nPlaintiffs. \nBecause the Defendants will no longer provide Medicaid funds for year round, center-\nbased, one-to-one, ABA therapy for 35-40 hours per week,  Plaintiff children will lose medically \nnecessary services which they currently receive. \nWhen children with autism receive intensive behavioral intervention at a young age, they \ndemonstrate significant increases in their LQ. scores during early childhood, and significant \ngains in adaptive behavior. (Ex. I, Mulick Dec!. ,  26). Even if children with autism do not \nreceive these services until they are older, they can significantly increase their adaptive skills and \ndecrease their self-destructive, aggressive, and other kinds of socially undesirable behavior. (Ex. \n1, Mulick Dec!. ,  27). \nIf Plaintiff children do not receive these services, they will experience a regression in \nskills and an increase in unwanted, often dangerous, behaviors. (Ex. 5, Christiansen Dec!. -:, 6-\n10; Ex. 9, Rosner Dec!.; Ex. 2, A.C. Dec!., 17; Ex. 3, K.G. Dec!., 12; Ex. 4, K.W. Decl.' 17). \nPlaintiff children's maladaptive behaviors will likely increase, safety will be difficult or \nimpossible to provide for, and learning will be stunted and perhaps not possible. (Ex. 8, \nLaMarche Dec!. ,  B). Additionally, Plaintiff children risk the possibility of being segregated \nfrom their peers. (Ex. 9, Rosner Ded). The loss of services currently provided by SBSA to \nPlaintiff children will not result in the maximum reduction of their developmental disabilities or \nrestoration of their best possible function level, as mandated by 42 U.s.C. § 1396d(a)(13). \n14 \n\nPlaintiff parents have not found nor have Defendants offered alternative services that will \nresult in the maximum reduction of the Plaintiff childrens' developmental disabilities or \nrestoration of their best possible functional level as mandated by 42 U.S.C. §1396d(a)(13). \nNationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio offers a program of early intensive \nbehavioral intervention to autistic children up to age 5 or 6, with less intensive follow up \nthereafter. (Ex. 1, Mulick Decl. ~ 31). Nationwide Children's Hospital Autism Center currently \nhas a long waiting list and the comprehensive service is costly. (Ex. 1, Mulick DecL ~ 32). \nNationwide Children's Hospital Autism Center is based on a home and community model of \nservice delivery, and children who require center-based services and out-of-home teaching \ncannot receive these through the Autism Center. (Ex. 1, Mulick ~ 33). Often children evaluated \nat Nationwide Children's Hospital Developmental Evaluation Program are referred to SBSA \nbecause they offer center-based behavioral intervention and because they offer a high quality \nservice. (Ex. 1, Mulick Decl.1f 34). \nPlaintiff parents have been urged to contact their local school districts to attempt to \nrecover lost services through special education. Unfortunately, ABA programs can be expensive \nand have not been widely adopted by school systems. (Ex. 1, Mulick Decl. ~ 23). In the past, \nPlaintiff children did not receive proper services when enrolled in local school district programs. \nPlaintiff children were not engaged in services, did not have interaction with teachers or peers \nand exhibited serious dangerous behaviors. (Ex. 5, Christiansen Dec!. ~ 7; Ex. 2, A.C. Dec!. ~ 19; \nEx. 4, A.W. Decl. .-,r19-20). \nOnce Defendants' new rules become effective, some reduced services may be available \nto Plaintiff children from other sources and a reduced SBSA program. If the temporary \nrestraining order is not granted, not only will these services will not result in the maximum \n15 \n\nreduction of Plaintiff children's developmental disabilities or restoration of their best possible \nfunctional level as mandated by 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(l3), but also, these children will suffer loss \nof skills, increased negative behavior and irreparable harm. \nC.  The threatened injury to Plaintiffs outweighs tbe little or uo harm that maintaining status \nquo through a temporary restraining order would cause Defendants. \nAs Defendants' rules are not effective until July I, 2008, Plaintiffs request only the \nmaintenance of the status quo. Allowing the status quo to be maintained will not jeopardize any \ninterest of Defendants nor cause any harm to them. In contrast, Plaintiff children face serious \nhann if the temporary restraining order is not issued. Plaintiff children will lose services that they \ncurrently receive. Due to the loss of services, and as extensively documented in the attached \ndeclarations, Plaintiff children will experience a regression in skills and an increase in unwanted, \noften dangerous, behaviors. Additionally, Plaintiff children are at an increased risk of being \nplaced in a segregated special education classroom or costly institutional care. There are no other \ncomparable alternatives from which Plaintiff children could receive services that would result in \nthe maximum reduction of their developmental disabilities or restoration of their best possible \nfunctional level. Plaintiffs and their families will suffer great harm if no injunction is granted. \nD.  The public interest favors the issuance of a temporary restraining order. \nPublic interest favors the preservation of the right of ehildren with disabilities to \nmaintain, without interruption, needed services. Congress amended the Medicaid Act in 1989 to \nmandate that a state agency must provide EPSDT- eligible ehildren \"all reasonably necessary \nmedical care.\" Rosie D. v. Romney, 410 F. Supp. 2d 18,22 (D. Mass. 2006). The specific \nlanguage states that Medicaid-eligible children must receive \"such other necessary health care to \ncorrect or ameliorate defects, . .illnesses and conditions discovered by the screening services, \nwhether or not such services are covered under the state plan,\" 42 U.S.c. 1396d(r)(5). In effect \n16 \n\nthat means that \"no Medicaid-eligible child in this country ... will go without treatment deemed \nmedically necessary by his or her clinician.\" Rosie D., 410 F. Supp. 2d at 22. \nChildren who receive appropriate treatment for autism can make significant gains in most \nareas of their lives. (Ex. 1, Mulick Decl. ~ 11). After intensive behavioral intervention in early \nchildhood, some children can achieve normal levels of learning and can live and work \nindependently as adults. (Ex. 1, Mulick Decl. 11). Those children who do not receive appropriate \ncare face being institutionalized at a cost which is much higher and oflonger duration than \ntreatment. Cost analysis studies show a savings of$I,OOO,OOO per child over that child's lifetime \nby receiving this medically necessary, 35-40 hours per week, one-to-one, early intervention. (Ex. \n8, LaMarche Decl. ~ A). \nThe changes proposed by Defendants are not necessary for compliance with federal \nMedicaid rules. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the federal agency \nwhich administers Medicaid program, is not requiring Ohio to make changes. Several states, \nincluding Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, mandate intensive behavioral intervention programs \nfunded by Medicaid for children with autism through age eleven. (Ex. 1, Mulick Dec!. ~ 28). \nAt the federal level, Congress has expressed its opposition to similar rehabilitative \nrestrictions. Congress included language imposing a moratorium on the proposed federal \nregulations on rehabilitative services in two bills on children's health insurance and the budget \nbill covering the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. See Pub. 1. No. llO-173, \nllOth Congo (2008). Recently, the \"Protecting the Medicaid Safety Net Act of2008\", House Bill \n5613, which proposes to further extend the moratoria in Public Law 110-173 passed in the \n17 \n\nUnited States House of Representative. 1 A similar bill proposing to further extend the moratoria \nin Public Law 110-173 was introduced in the United States Senate as S 2819. \nThe public interest favors the issuance of this injunction. \nIII. Security \nRule 65(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires that seeuritybe set \"in sueh \nsum as the court deems proper, for the payment of sueh costs and damages as may be ineurred or \nsuffered by any party who is found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.\" \nDefendants carmot state any legitimate cost or damage to be incurred by maintaining \nstatus quo pending resolution of this case. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has held that \ndistrict courts have discretion not to require any posting of security. Moltan Co. v. Eagle-Pincher \nIndustries. Inc., 55 F. 3d 1171 (6th Cir. 1995). Moreover, Plaintiffs are Medicaid-eligible, oflow \nincome and lack the resources to post bond. This Court should deem the proper sum of security \nin this matter to be zero. \nIV. Conclusion \nFor the reasons cited above, Plaintiff requests that this Court grant this instant Motion for \nTemporary Restraining Order. \nRespectfull y submitted, \nMichelle F.

Jones-Kelley\ntwo amended state administrative rules.  The Parents’ League for Effective Autism Services, along\nwith three children with autism and their guardians, brought this suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\nclaiming violations of their rights under federal Medicaid law.  Plaintiffs claimed that amendments\nto state administrative rules promulgated by defendants deprived them of services required by the\nfederal Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment program.  The district court granted\nplaintiffs’ request for a temporary restraining order and preliminarily enjoined the implementation\nof the amended rules.  The district court found that plaintiffs have a likelihood of success on the\nmerits of their claims, that plaintiffs would suffer irreparable injury absent preliminary injunctive\nrelief, that Ohio would not be harmed by the injunction, and that the public interest would be served\nby the issuance of the preliminary injunction.  The district court did not abuse its discretion in\nweighing these four factors when it granted plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction.\nI.\nPlaintiffs are three Medicaid-eligible children and their guardians, and the Parents’ League\nfor Effective Autism Services (“PLEAS”), an association of parents whose children receive services\nfrom Step by Step Academy (“SBSA”) under Medicaid.  SBSA is a nonprofit treatment center that\nfocuses on providing Applied Behavioral Analysis (“ABA”) services to children with autism.\nFederal regulations define autism as a “developmental disability significantly affecting verbal\nand nonverbal communication and social interaction, generally evident before age three, that\nadversely affects a child’s educational performance.  Other characteristics often associated with\n- 22 -\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00421-JLG-NMK Doc #: 55 Filed: 08/03/09 Page: 3 of 21  PAGEID #: 1441\nNo. 08-3931\nParents’ League for Effective Autism Servs. v. Jones-Kelley\nautism  are  engagement  in  repetitive  activities  and  stereotyped  movements,  resistance  to\nenvironmental change or change in daily routines, and unusual responses to sensory experiences.”\n34 C.F.R. § 300.8(c)(1)(i).  According to plaintiffs’ expert, ABA therapy is a “highly effective form\nof behavioral treatment” that uses a “one-on-one teaching approach that relies on reinforced practice\nof various skills,” and “[t]he best treatment plan [for children with autism] will include ABA, the\nonly treatment approach confirmed as effective by a comprehensive evaluation of all proposed\ntherapies in a well know[n] government sponsored review process.”  Decl. of James A. Mulick,\nPh.D.,  at  ¶¶  20,  21.  (citing  http://www.health.state.ny.us/community/infants_children/\nearly_intervention/autism/ index.htm).\nPlaintiff children receive ABA therapy, along with other services, from SBSA:\nStep by Step Academy provides treatment services exclusively for children with\nautism or related autism spectrum symptoms.  This full-day, year round intervention\nis based on Applied Behavior Analysis, a system of controlling the environment,\nestablishing sequential goals, providing discrete trials for learning with a high rate\nof repetition, insuring reinforcement of success in learning trials, and planned\ngeneralization training.  Using one-to-one and small group intervention, the treatment\nfocuses on the amelioration of autism symptoms and skill deficits.  Individualized\ngoals within the diagnostic criteria focus on each child’s receptive and expressive\nlanguage,  communication,  socialization,  self-help  skills,  and  general  behavior\npatterns for optimal learning.\nDecl. of Jeffrey A. Christiansen, Psy.D., staff psychologist with SBSA, at ¶ 5.  Plaintiffs claim that\nthis therapy provides significant benefits for the plaintiff children.  Defendants note that SBSA’s\none-to-one ABA therapy is provided at great expense.  Defendants claim that in fiscal year 2007,\nSBSA billed the Ohio Medicaid program approximately $2.6 million for services provided to 42\nchildren, which is one-half of Ohio’s expenditures in the specific Medicaid treatment program that\n- 33 -\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00421-JLG-NMK Doc #: 55 Filed: 08/03/09 Page: 4 of 21  PAGEID #: 1442\nNo. 08-3931\nParents’ League for Effective Autism Servs. v. Jones-Kelley\nfunded SBSA’s services.

ODJFS works with ODMH to promulgate the Ohio Administrative Code rules that govern\nOhio’s Medicaid program.  Defendant Kerry Weems is the Acting Administrator of the Federal\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), an agency under the Department of Health\nand Human Services responsible for administering the federal Medicaid program.1\nOn August 13, 2007, CMS filed proposed rules that would limit Medicaid’s coverage of\nrehabilitative services.  72 Fed.

Jones-Kelley\nAfter CMS proposed restrictions on rehabilitative services, ODJFS promulgated amendments\nto Ohio’s Administrative Rules.  The first amended rule, Ohio Admin. Code § 5122-29-17, redefined\nOhio’s Community Psychiatric Supportive Treatment (“CPST”) program, which was the program\nthat  funded  SBSA’s  services.    The  amendment  limited  CPST  services  to  those  that  were\nrehabilitative in nature.  The second amended rule, Ohio Admin. Code § 5101:3-27-02, redefined\nwhen Ohio’s Medicaid program would cover community mental health services.  This amended rule\nlimited coverage to those services that were rehabilitative, and defined rehabilitative services as\nthose that restore an individual to a prior functional level.  These two amended rules were\npromulgated on February 28, 2008, and were set to go into effect on July 1, 2008.\nOn March 21, 2008, Gwendolyn Sampson, Acting Associate Regional Administrator at CMS,\nsent a letter to ODJFS raising concerns about whether SBSA’s services are Medicaid-reimbursable\nexpenditures:\nStep by Step has been billing Medicaid for community psychiatric supportive\ntreatment (CPST) for children diagnosed with autism.  CPST is a rehabilitative\nservice under Ohio’s State Plan intended to maximize the reduction of symptoms of\nmental illness in order to restore the individual’s functioning.  CMS generally views\ntreatment for autism as habilitative rather than rehabilitative—as such, the CPST\nclaims by Step by Step may not comply with Ohio’s State Plan.\nThe letter indicated that CMS was deferring payment for the expenditures submitted by SBSA.\nODJFS was provided the opportunity to justify these expenditures, but the record does not indicate\nwhether ODJFS took any steps to provide CMS with further information.  The letter from CMS used\nthe definition of CPST services from the amended rules, not yet in effect.\n- 55 -\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00421-JLG-NMK Doc #: 55 Filed: 08/03/09 Page: 6 of 21  PAGEID #: 1444\nNo. 08-3931\nParents’ League for Effective Autism Servs. v. Jones-Kelley\nOn May 2, 2008, plaintiffs filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of Ohio, claiming that Ohio’s amended administrative rules violate federal Medicaid law.\nSpecifically, plaintiffs asserted that the federal Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and\nTreatment (“EPSDT”) program requires Ohio, as a voluntary state recipient of federal Medicaid\nfunds, to provide eligible children various treatment services.  Plaintiffs claim that SBSA’s ABA\ntherapy is covered as a mandatory rehabilitative service under EPSDT, and that the rejection of\nfunding for these services under the amended Ohio administrative rules would violate EPSDT’s\nmandate.    Plaintiffs  moved  for  a  temporary  restraining  order  enjoining  defendants  from\nimplementing the amended rules.\nThe district court held a hearing on plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunctive relief.  On\nJune 30, 2008, the day before the amended rules were to take effect, the district court granted\nplaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order.  Parents League for Effective Autism Servs. v.\nJones-Kelley, 565 F. Supp. 2d 905 (S.D. Ohio 2008).  First, the district court found that abstention\nwas not required under the Burford abstention doctrine.  Id. at 913-14.  Second, the court found that\npreliminary injunctive relief was appropriate because: (1) plaintiffs have a strong likelihood of\nshowing  that  the  EPSDT-mandated  services  under  Medicaid  law,  specifically  42  U.S.C.  §\n1396d(a)(13), require Ohio to cover SBSA’s services and that Ohio’s amended administrative rules\nwould unlawfully deny plaintiffs these mandatory services; (2) plaintiffs would suffer irreparable\ninjury if the amended rules were implemented because they would experience severe regression in\ntheir symptoms; (3) Ohio will not be harmed by the preliminary injunctive relief because complying\n- 66 -\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00421-JLG-NMK Doc #: 55 Filed: 08/03/09 Page: 7 of 21  PAGEID #: 1445\nNo. 08-3931\nParents’ League for Effective Autism Servs. v. Jones-Kelley\nwith federal Medicaid law is not a harm; and (4) the public interest will be served by preliminary\ninjunctive relief because the early treatment of autism has been shown to provide significant\nimprovement and the cost of providing care will be greater if these individuals do not receive\ntreatment at an early stage.2  Id. at 914-18.  On July 1, 2008, the district court granted a preliminary\ninjunction based on the reasons set forth in its June 30, 2008, memorandum.3\nDefendants filed a motion to stay the preliminary injunction, but the district court denied this\nrequest.  Defendants appealed the district court’s order granting the preliminary injunction.4\nII.\nThe district court did not abuse its discretion in granting plaintiffs’ request for preliminary\ninjunctive relief enjoining defendants from implementing the two amendments to the administrative\nrules.  This case involves  an alleged conflict between  an ambiguous federal Medicaid provision and\namendments to two of Ohio’s administrative rules.

In this order, the\ndistrict court found that plaintiffs have standing to sue and that plaintiffs have alleged violations of\na right enforceable through 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Defendants did not appeal this interlocutory order.\n3Normally, an appellate court does not have jurisdiction to review the grant of a temporary\nrestraining order.  It is clear from this order, however, that in addition to granting plaintiffs’ motion\nfor a temporary restraining order, the court also granted a preliminary injunction and both parties\ntreat the order as a preliminary injunction.  This court has jurisdiction to review the preliminary\ninjunction under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a).\n4On appeal, defendants do not challenge the district court’s ruling on the inapplicability of\nBurford abstention.\n- 77 -\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00421-JLG-NMK Doc #: 55 Filed: 08/03/09 Page: 8 of 21  PAGEID #: 1446\nNo. 08-3931\nParents’ League for Effective Autism Servs. v. Jones-Kelley\nadministering the Medicaid program has yet to take a position on the issues relevant to this case.  At\nthis stage of the litigation, we are not deciding that plaintiffs will succeed in showing a violation of\ntheir rights under Medicaid law, but only that the district court did not abuse its discretion in\nconcluding that the four factors involved in reviewing a request for preliminary injunctive relief on\nbalance weighed in favor of granting plaintiffs’ requested injunctive relief.  See Leary v. Daeschner,\n228 F.3d 729, 736 (6th Cir. 2000) (reciting the four-factor test).  \nThe district court properly considered the extent to which: (1) plaintiffs have a likelihood of\nsuccess with regard to whether Ohio is required under the federal Medicaid statute to cover SBSA’s\nABA therapy when medically necessary, and whether the amended Ohio administrative rules\neffectively cut off funding for these services; (2) plaintiffs would suffer irreparable injury absent an\ninjunction; (3) the injunction would not cause substantial harm to others; and (4) the public interest\nwould be served by issuance of a preliminary injunction.  The district court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in finding that these factors weigh in favor of granting preliminary injunctive relief, and\nthe court has not “relied upon clearly erroneous findings of fact, improperly applied the governing\nlaw, or used an erroneous legal standard.”  Tumblebus, Inc. v. Cranmer, 399 F.3d 754, 760 (6th Cir.\n2005).\nA.  Likelihood of success on the merits\n“The preliminary question of whether a movant is likely to succeed on the merits is a\nquestion of law which we decide de novo.”  Tumblebus, 399 F.3d at 760.

Jones-Kelley\ndetermined that plaintiffs have a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims because: 1)\nfederal Medicaid provisions likely require coverage of SBSA’s ABA therapy when determined to\nbe medically necessary; and 2) the amendments to the Ohio administrative rules would have the\ncombined effect of cutting off funding for these services.  \n1.  Whether 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(13) covers the services provided by SBSA\nThe ambiguities in the federal Medicaid provision requiring reimbursement for rehabilitative\nservices make a definitive determination on coverage of specific treatments a difficult proposition,\nespecially without the input of CMS on these issues.  This factor accordingly does not weigh strongly\nfor or against a preliminary injunction.  \nBecause Ohio accepted federal Medicaid funds, the state Medicaid plan must provide for\nEPSDT screening services as defined by 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(r) and provide: “. . .  corrective treatment\nthe  need  for  which  is  disclosed  by  such  child  health  screening  services.”  42  U.S.C.  §\n1396a(a)(43)(C).  Section 1396d(r) requires states to provide several specific services and:\n[s]uch other necessary health care, diagnostic services, treatment, and other measures\ndescribed in subsection (a) of this section to correct or ameliorate defects and\nphysical and mental illnesses and conditions discovered by the screening services,\nwhether or not such services are covered under the State plan.\n§ 1396d(r)(5).  Taken together, these provisions require Ohio to provide EPSDT-eligible children\nall of the services in subsection § 1396d(a) that are determined to be medically necessary.\n- 99 -\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00421-JLG-NMK Doc #: 55 Filed: 08/03/09 Page: 10 of 21  PAGEID #: 1448\nNo. 08-3931\nParents’ League for Effective Autism Servs. v. Jones-Kelley\nSection 1396d(a) includes 28 categories of services that Ohio must fund for eligible children\nunder EPSDT’s mandate.  Most relevant to this case is § 1396d(a)(13), which requires states to\nprovide:\nother diagnostic, screening, preventive, and rehabilitative services, including any\nmedical or remedial services (provided in a facility, a home, or other setting)\nrecommended by a physician or other licensed practitioner of the healing arts within\nthe scope of their practice under State law, for the maximum reduction of physical\nor mental disability and restoration of an individual to the best possible functional\nlevel.\n§ 1396d(a)(13).  \nThough § 1396d(a)(13) does not explicitly address the services provided by SBSA, it\narguably does so when the services are medically necessary.\nThe majority of defendants’ arguments are based on their classification of SBSA’s services\nas habilitative and therefore outside the scope of EPSDT’s mandates.  Defendants argue that §\n1396d(a)(13) only mandates rehabilitative services, that SBSA’s ABA therapy is exclusively\nhabilitative, and that habilitative services are only provided for under separate, non-mandatory\nMedicaid provisions.5  In its opinion and order denying defendants’ motion to stay the injunction,\n5Federal regulations define “rehabilitative services” as:\nany medical or remedial services recommended by a physician or other licensed\npractitioner of the healing arts, within the scope of his practice under State law, for\nmaximum reduction of physical or mental disability and restoration of a recipient to\nhis best possible functional level.\n42 C.F.R. § 440.130(d).  In a section dealing with state waiver programs, the Medicaid Act defines\n“habilitative services” as:\n- 1100 -\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00421-JLG-NMK Doc #: 55 Filed: 08/03/09 Page: 11 of 21  PAGEID #: 1449\nNo. 08-3931\nParents’ League for Effective Autism Servs. v. Jones-Kelley\nthe district court rejected this argument stating: “After careful study of the relevant statutes and\nregulations, this Court concluded that th[e habilitative versus rehabilitative] dichotomy has no\nrelevance to medical or remedial services for children when the treatment has been recommended\nby a physician or other licensed practitioner for the ‘maximum reduction of a physical or mental\ndisability.’”  Parents League for Effective Autism Servs. v. Jones-Kelley, 2008 WL 2796744, at *1\n(S.D. Ohio July 17, 2008). The district court noted the potential overlap between services classified\nas habilitative or rehabilitative, and found that plaintiffs have a strong likelihood of showing that\nSBSA’s services fall under the definition of services required under § 1396d(a)(13). \nThe district court found that SBSA’s ABA therapy “is a medically necessary service which\nprovides the maximum reduction of a mental or physical disability.”  Parents League, 565 F. Supp.\n2d at 917.  There was medical evidence before the district court to support the factual aspects of this\nconclusion.  Defendants argue, however, that in addition to the “maximum reduction” element, §\n1396d(a)(13) requires “restoration of an individual to the best possible functional level,” and that\n“restoring” in this context excludes SBSA’s services because the children it serves did not once have\na functional level that the therapy attempts to restore.\nIt is true that this provision can be read to mandate only services recommended by a\nphysician that provide both a “maximum reduction of physical or mental disability and restoration\nservices designed to assist individuals in acquiring, retaining, and improving the\nself-help, socialization, and adaptive skills necessary to reside successfully in home\nand community based settings.\n42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(5)(A).\n- 1111 -\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00421-JLG-NMK Doc #: 55 Filed: 08/03/09 Page: 12 of 21  PAGEID #: 1450\nNo. 08-3931\nParents’ League for Effective Autism Servs. v. Jones-Kelley\nof an individual to the best possible functional level.”  However, this provision can also be read to\nmandate both services recommended by a physician “for the maximum reduction of physical or\nmental disability,” and services recommended by a physician for the “restoration of an individual\nto the best possible functional level.”  The choice between two ways to read “and” in a statute is\noften made by looking to “context and common sense.”  OfficeMax, Inc. v. United States, 428 F.3d\n583, 597 (6th Cir. 2005).  “Whether to interpret the preceding words as distributed over the\nconjoined elements or not depends on the context of the sentence, and what we externally know\nabout the conjoined elements.”  Id. at 600 (Rogers, J., dissenting).  The language of the statute\nsupports either reading, and there are reasons, relied on by the district court, to read the statute\nplaintiffs’ way.\nFirst, § 1396d(a)(13) “reflects the extremely broad EPSDT obligation.”  Parents League, 565\nF. Supp. 2d at 912.  Defendants’ reading of § 1396d(a)(13) to cover only services that restore a child\nto a prior skill level would arguably “mean that no child who is born with a disability, could ever\nreceive rehabilitative services.”  Parents League, 565 F. Supp. 2d at 916.  Such an outcome arguably\n“does not comport with the broad coverage afforded under the EPSDT mandate.”  Id.\nSecond, cases from other circuits have concluded that § 1396d(a) covers services that are\narguably similar to the ABA therapy provided by SBSA.  See Pediatric Specialty Care, Inc. v.\nArkansas Dept. of Human Services, 293 F.3d 472, 480 (8th Cir. 2002); Chisholm v. Hood, 133 F.\nSupp. 2d 894 (E.D. La. 2001).\n- 1122 -\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00421-JLG-NMK Doc #: 55 Filed: 08/03/09 Page: 13 of 21  PAGEID #: 1451\nNo. 08-3931\nParents’ League for Effective Autism Servs. v. Jones-Kelley\nThird, no administrative interpretations of § 1396d(a)(13) appear to clarify or restrict the\nprovision in the way suggested by defendants.  Defendants cite several administrative materials that\nstate  that  “habilitation  services  cannot  be  provided  pursuant  to  42  U.S.C.  §§  1396d(a)  or\n1396d(a)(13).”  These materials simply state that habilitation services can only be funded through\nother Medicaid provisions, such as those dealing with ICF/MR residents or approved Medicaid\nwaivers.  These materials do not support the proposition that ABA therapy is exclusively habilitative,\nwhich plaintiffs dispute, or that ABA therapy should not otherwise be covered under § 1396d(a). \nThe district court’s attempts to get the federal government’s view of the meaning of §\n1396d(a)(13) appear to have been elusive.  In a case such as this, the federal court is entitled to a\nclear statement of the federal agency’s interpretation of the federal Act that it administers.  On March\n21, 2008, CMS sent a letter to ODJFS deferring  payment on claims made by SBSA and stated that\n“CMS generally views treatment for autism as habilitative rather than rehabilitative—as such, the\nCPST claims by Step by Step may not comply with Ohio’s State Plan.”  However, during the hearing\non plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunctive relief, the district court questioned a representative\nfrom CMS in an attempt to nail down the agency’s official position on the matter:\nTHE COURT: Does CMS have a position on whether these services are\ncovered under the Medicaid Act?\nMR. D’ALESSANDRO: Your Honor, I hate to use the word “it depends,”\nbut the answer is, it depends on the service.  And I think that’s what the deferral\nprocess is going to decide for all of us. . . .  And I think the State may have spoken\na little too strongly when it said we have decided not to pay.  There has been no such\ndecision not to pay. That’s what the deferral process is for.\nYour Honor, it’s our understanding that the deferral letter may have come\nabout based on information gleaned from a county agency which was providing funds\nto Step-by-Step, the county advised the state, and the deferral process was started.\n- 1133 -\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00421-JLG-NMK Doc #: 55 Filed: 08/03/09 Page: 14 of 21  PAGEID #: 1452\nNo. 08-3931\nParents’ League for Effective Autism Servs. v. Jones-Kelley\nI would like to note that the deferral letter, . . .  I will acknowledge, Your Honor, that\nthe language used by CMS in the letter of March 21st does appear to hone in on one\nissue, the issue of rehabilitative versus habilitative. I think that may have been an\nunfortunate choice by the Acting Associate Regional Administrator to hone in on\nthat. I think all coverage and eligibility and reimbursement issues are in play during\nthe deferral process.\n. . .\nTo any extent—and I don’t believe it was their intent, but to any extent that\nthe State left the impression that there is a done deal here, I don’t think that’s the\ncase.\nThe agency’s uncertainty on these issues does not contradict the district court’s conclusion that\nplaintiffs have a likelihood of showing that these services are required under the federal Medicaid\nstatute.\nIn addition to the agency’s stated uncertainty in this case, proposed regulations further reflect\nthe ambiguity of § 1396d(a)(13).  In 2007, CMS proposed to amend the regulations regarding\n“rehabilitative services” because of concerns that states were using § 1396d(a)(13) to cover services\nthat were not truly “rehabilitative.”  72 Fed. Reg. 45201 (citing as an example “behavioral treatment\nservices  in  ‘wilderness  camps,’  juvenile  detention,  and  similar  facilities  where  youth  are\ninvoluntarily confined” that should fall “under the domain of the juvenile justice or youth systems\nin the State, rather than Medicaid.”).  Even if these proposed regulations would support defendants’\nposition, Congress placed a moratorium on the final adoption of these regulations.   See Pub. L. No.\n110-28 § 7001(a); Pub. L. No. 110-252 § 7001(a) (extending moratorium on regulations restricting\ncoverage of rehabilitative services until April 1, 2009); Pub. L. No. 111-5 § 5003(a), (d)(3) (January\n4, 2009) (noting a “sense of Congress” that the proposed regulations relating to rehabilitative\nservices should not be promulgated as final regulations).  This situation shows the current\n- 1144 -\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00421-JLG-NMK Doc #: 55 Filed: 08/03/09 Page: 15 of 21  PAGEID #: 1453\nNo. 08-3931\nParents’ League for Effective Autism Servs. v. Jones-Kelley\nuncertainty regarding the definition of services in § 1396d(a)(13), which makes it even harder for\nus to find an abuse of discretion when the district court weighed in plaintiffs’ favor the likelihood\nof success with respect to whether SBSA’s services are required under § 1396d(a)(13).\n2.  Whether implementation of the Ohio amended rules would violate federal Medicaid\nlaws\nThe district court also found a likelihood of success on the merits “because the proposed\nadministrative rules will effectively cut off funding for medically necessary services.” Parents\nLeague, 565 F. Supp. 2d at 917.  Again, while it is not clear that this is so, the district court did not\nabuse its discretion by weighing the likelihood of success on this issue in favor of plaintiffs.\nIn response to concerns over the federal approval of funding of SBSA’s services, the Ohio\nDepartment of Job and Family Services (“ODJFS”) and the Ohio Department of Mental Health\n(“ODMH”) promulgated rules amending the state administrative provisions that previously covered\nSBSA’s services.  Ohio Administrative Code section 5122-29-17 defines Community Psychiatric\nSupportive Treatment (“CPST”) services, which is the general program under which SBSA receives\nits funding.  The prior rule stated that:\nCommunity psychiatric supportive treatment (CPST) service provides an array of\nservices delivered by community based, mobile individuals or multidisciplinary\nteams of professionals and trained others.  Services address the individualized mental\nhealth needs of the client.  They are directed towards adults, children, adolescents and\nfamilies and will vary with respect to hours, type and intensity of services, depending\non the changing needs of each individual.\nThe purpose/intent of CPST services is to provide specific, measurable, and\nindividualized services to each person served.  CPST services should be focused on\n- 1155 -\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00421-JLG-NMK Doc #: 55 Filed: 08/03/09 Page: 16 of 21  PAGEID #: 1454\nNo. 08-3931\nParents’ League for Effective Autism Servs. v. Jones-Kelley\nthe individual’s ability to succeed in the community; to identify and access needed\nservices; and to show improvement in school, work and family and integration and\ncontributions within the community.\nOhio Admin. Code § 5122-29-17(A).\nThe amendments to this provision focus the program on rehabilitative services:\nCommunity psychiatric supportive treatment (CPST) service is a rehabilitative\nservice intended to maximize the reduction of symptoms of mental illness in order\nto restore the individual’s functioning to the highest level possible.  CPST supports\nthe individual’s ability to take responsibility for managing his/her mental illness and\nachieving and maintaining his/her rehabilitative and/or recovery goals.\nOhio Admin. Code § 5122-29-17(A) (as amended).  The amended rule contained extensive\nadditional changes to this code provision that are not relevant to this case.\nOhio Administrative Code § 5101:3-27-02 defines when the Ohio Medicaid program will\ncover community mental and health services.  The amendments to this section require services to\nbe rehabilitative and provide a new definition of rehabilitation:\nThe following describes those services reimbursable as medicaid community mental\nhealth service when they are both rehabilitative and rendered by eligible medicaid\nproviders.  Rehabilitative services provide for the maximum reduction of mental\nillness and are intended to restore an individual to the best possible functional\nlevel.  The services shall meet the principles set forth in rule 5101:3-1-02 of the\nAdministrative Code.\nOhio Admin Code § 5101:3-27-02(A) (amended language in bold).\nThese amended rules arguably conflict with federal Medicaid law because the amendments\nto rule 5101:3-1-02 “reflect a much more narrow definition of ‘rehabilitative’ . . . .  The federal\nregulations do not require that the rehabilitative services reduce ‘mental illness.’”  Parents League,\n565 F. Supp. 2d at 910.  The more apparent conflict, however, stems from the Ohio rules’\n- 1166 -\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00421-JLG-NMK Doc #: 55 Filed: 08/03/09 Page: 17 of 21  PAGEID #: 1455\nNo. 08-3931\nParents’ League for Effective Autism Servs. v. Jones-Kelley\n“restoration” requirements.  As noted in Part II.A.1, supra, the relevant federal Medicaid provisions\ndo not necessarily require rehabilitative services to involve both a “maximum reduction of physical\nor mental disability” and a “restoration of an individual to the best possible functional level” for each\nindividual.    The  language  of  the  amended  Ohio  rules,  however,  narrows  the  definition  of\nrehabilitative services by requiring restoration to the best functional level.  Under the Ohio amended\nrules, rehabilitative services are “intended to maximize the reduction of symptoms of mental illness\nin order to restore the individual’s functioning to the highest level possible,” Ohio Admin. Code §\n5122-29-17(A) (as amended) (emphasis added), and “provide for the maximum reduction of mental\nillness and are intended to restore an individual to the best possible functional level,” Ohio Admin\nCode § 5101:3-27-02(A) (as amended) (emphasis added).\nIn addition to noting the potential conflict between the amended rules and the federal\nMedicaid statute, the district court focused on the likely effects of defendants’ implementation of\nthese rules.  “Because the proposed administrative rules will effectively cut off funding for medically\nnecessary services, Plaintiffs have established a likelihood of success on the merits.”  Parents\nLeague, 565 F. Supp. 2d at 917 (emphasis added). “The proposed amendments specifically target\nthe provision of CPST services to these children.” Id.  “The evidence is clear that the State adopted\nthe new rules to avoid having to pay for services which it was concerned would not be reimbursed\nby CMS.”  Id. at 917-18.\nThe district court did not abuse its discretion in relying on the likelihood that plaintiffs’ will\nbe able to show that the amended rules would effectively deny funding for SBSA’s ABA therapy.\n- 1177 -\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00421-JLG-NMK Doc #: 55 Filed: 08/03/09 Page: 18 of 21  PAGEID #: 1456\nNo. 08-3931\nParents’ League for Effective Autism Servs. v. Jones-Kelley\nThe rules were promulgated in response to concerns over federal funding of this program, defendants\nbegan seeking alternate services for the children previously served by SBSA,  and everything in\ndefendants’ briefing indicates that they believe SBSA’s services to be habilitative in nature and not\ncovered by the new rules or the federal EPSDT mandate.\nB.  Irreparable injury to plaintiffs\nThe district court also did not abuse its discretion in weighing the possibility of irreparable\ninjury to plaintiffs because, as noted in the previous section, defendants appear to interpret the\namended rules to exclude SBSA’s ABA therapy from funding under Ohio’s CPST program.  In\naddition, medical and personal testimony indicated that the plaintiff children would suffer irreparable\ninjury in the form of severe regression of symptoms if SBSA’s services are no longer available, and\nplaintiffs could not receive comparable services from other providers that provide services under\nother sources of federal or state funding.\nDefendants argue that plaintiffs will not suffer under the amended rules because plaintiffs\nhave other avenues of receiving Medicaid coverage for SBSA’s services if the services are medically\nnecessary.  For example, plaintiffs can request prior authorization of the ABA therapy provided by\nSBSA, claiming that this service is required under federal Medicaid law.  Because ODJFS and\nODMH appear not to accept that ABA therapy is rehabilitative under the amended rules or §\n1396d(a)(13), this path may simply lead back to a dispute in the courts over the coverage of ABA\ntherapy under the EPSDT mandate.  \n- 1188 -\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00421-JLG-NMK Doc #: 55 Filed: 08/03/09 Page: 19 of 21  PAGEID #: 1457\nNo. 08-3931\nParents’ League for Effective Autism Servs. v.

Plaintiff children are Medicaid eligible. They currently receive medically necessary \nservices funded through Medicaid from Step By Step Academy (SBSA) in Worthington, Ohio. \nDefendant Jones-Kelley, in her official capacity as Director of the Ohio Department of Job and \nFamily Services, and Defendant Stephenson, in her official capacity as Director of the Ohio \nDepartment of Mental Health, have promulgated rules that govern the Medicaid program in \nOhio.  These rules limit the services to be paid for by Medicaid in violation of federal law. As a \nresult, providers authorized by the state to deliver intensive behavioral health services to children \nwill lack the authority, capacity and funds necessary to provide ongoing, intensive community \nbased services to the Plaintiff children. Plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief to prevent \nthe loss or reduction of medically necessary services to which they are entitled under federal law. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n1.    This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 which provides for original \njurisdiction over civil suits arising under the Constitution, laws or treaties of the United \nStates and against Defendants acting under color of state law pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n2.    This Court also has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1343(3) and (4) which provide for \noriginal jurisdiction of the Court in all suits authorized by 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Plaintiffs seek to \nenforce the rights guaranteed them under the United States Constitution and the federal \nMedicaid laws, 42 U.S.C. §1396 et. seq. and the implementing federal regulations. \n  2 \n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00421-JLG-NMK Doc #: 27 Filed: 06/24/08 Page: 3 of 16  PAGEID #: 681\n3.  In addition, this Court has jurisdiction over the Plaintiffs’ claims for declaratory relief \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 and Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n4.  Venue is proper in the Southern District of Ohio, Eastern Division, because the \ndefendants are located in this district within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) and because \nthe events, acts and omissions giving rise to the Plaintiffs’ claims occurred in this district. \nPARTIES \nPLAINTIFFS  \n5.

Defendant Helen Jones-Kelley, as director of Ohio Department of Job and Family \nServices (ODJFS), is responsible for the administration of the Medicaid program in Ohio.  \n  5 \n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00421-JLG-NMK Doc #: 27 Filed: 06/24/08 Page: 6 of 16  PAGEID #: 684\n34.  ODJFS is the single state agency for the Medicaid program in the State of Ohio and is \nrequired, pursuant to O.R.C. § 5111.01 and O.A.C. § 5101:1-37-01, to provide medical \nassistance in accordance with the federal Medicaid statute, Title XIX of the Social Security \nAct, 79 Stat. 286 (1965). \n35.  As the executive head of ODJFS under O.R.C. § 5101.02, Defendant Jones-Kelley is \nresponsible for the supervision and operation of the Medicaid program in Ohio in accordance \nwith the applicable federal Medicaid statutes and regulations. \n36.  Defendant Jones-Kelley is also responsible for ensuring that other state and county \nagencies and subdivisions with whom ODJFS contracts to administer the Medicaid program \ncomply with all applicable Medicaid laws and policies pursuant to O.R.C. § 5111.01.  \n37.  Defendant Jones-Kelley has acted and continues to act at all times relevant hereto in her \nofficial capacity and under color of state law.  \n38.  Defendant Sandra Stephenson is the Director of Ohio Department of Mental Health \n(ODHM).  \n39.  As chief executive and administrative officer of ODMH under O.R.C. § 5119.01, \nDefendant Stephenson is responsible for adopting rules that establish standards for services \nprovided by community mental health facilities. Defendant Stephenson has the authority to \nenter into contracts and other agreements. \n40.  As directors, Defendant Jones-Kelley and Defendant Stephenson entered into an inter-\nagency agreement between ODJFS and ODMH for the purpose of establishing a sub-\nrecipient relationship between the entities to implement 42 C.F.R. § 431 Part M and to \nprovide behavioral health services to people who are eligible for Ohio Medicaid benefits \n  6 \n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00421-JLG-NMK Doc #: 27 Filed: 06/24/08 Page: 7 of 16  PAGEID #: 685\nunder Title XIX of the Social Security Act. Interagency Agreement Between ODJFS and \nODMH, Article I, Section A.  \n41.  ODMH is considered the sub-recipient of the federal funds received from ODJFS, and \nmental health service providers are considered sub-recipients of the funds received from \nODMH.  \n42.  ODJFS, in consultation with ODMH, promulgates the Ohio Administrative Code rules \nthat govern the Medicaid program. \n43.  Defendant Stephenson has acted and continues to act at all times relevant hereto in her \nofficial capacity and under color of state law. \n44.  Defendant Kerry Weems is the Acting Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & \nMedicaid Services (CMS), an agency within the United States Department of Health and \nHuman Services which is responsible for, inter alia, administering the Medicaid program \nand, more specifically, providing the federal portion of payment for Medicaid services. \n45.  Medicaid is a federal program administered by the states in which the federal Medicaid \nauthority pays a portion of the cost (known as federal financial participation or \"FFP\") and \nthat portion is \"matched\" by the participating state. \n46.  Defendant Weems and CMS currently provide Ohio with approximately 60% federal \nfinancial participation as its share of Ohio's Medicaid costs. \n47.  Defendant Weems is joined as a necessary party under Fed. R. Civ. 19(a) pursuant to this \nCourt's Order dated June 20, 2008. \n48.  Defendant Weems is sued in his official capacity only. \nFACTS \n  7 \n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00421-JLG-NMK Doc #: 27 Filed: 06/24/08 Page: 8 of 16  PAGEID #: 686\n49.  Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 79 Stat. 286 (1965), (“the Medicaid Act”), at 42 \nU.S.C. Sections 1396 et seq., was enacted as a joint obligation by the federal government and \nparticipating states to provide medical assistance to low income and needy individuals who \nwould otherwise be unable to pay for necessary health care. States are not required to \nparticipate, but once a state elects to participate in the program, it is bound by the federal law \nand regulations set forth in the Social Security Act and its implementing regulations. \n50.  Title XIX of the Social Security Act lists twenty-seven services to be provided to \nindividuals who meet the qualifications listed in 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(i)-(xiii). \n51.  42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(43) requires participating states to include in their State Medicaid \nPlan a provision for the Early, Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) of all \nMedicaid eligible children under the age of twenty-one.  \n52.  The federal requirements for EPSDT are specifically detailed and require states to \nprovide “such other necessary health care, diagnostic services, treatment, and other measures \nto correct or to ameliorate defects and physical and mental illnesses and conditions \ndiscovered by the screening services, whether or not such services are covered under the \nState plan.” 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(r)(5). \n53.  The State of Ohio participates in the Federal Medicaid program, including the EPSDT \nprovisions. \n54.  Ohio’s EPSDT program is operated under the name “Healthchek” and is codified at \nO.A.C. §§ 5101:3-14-01 to 5101:3-14-22. \n55.  Plaintiff children are Medicaid eligible individuals under age twenty-one who are eligible \nfor EPSDT services set forth under the federal Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(43) and \n  8 \n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00421-JLG-NMK Doc #: 27 Filed: 06/24/08 Page: 9 of 16  PAGEID #: 687\n42 U.S.C. § 1396d(r) and Ohio’s Healthchek Program set forth at O.A.C. §§ 5101:3-14-01 \nthrough 5101:3-14-22. \n56.  Plaintiff children have all been diagnosed with a developmental disability on the autism \nspectrum. \n57.  Autism is now seen as a spectrum disorder, “Autism Spectrum Disorder” (ASD). Autistic \ndisorder, the full-blown condition, is one of five disorders falling under the umbrella of \n“Pervasive Developmental Disorder” (PDD), a category of neurodevelopmental disorders. \nPDD includes the disorders commonly diagnosed as Asperger's Disorder, Rett Syndrome, \nChildhood Disintegrative Disorder, and PDD - Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS). \n58.  Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disability that generally appears during the first \nthree years of life. It impacts the normal development of the brain, resulting in impairments \nof social interaction, verbal and non-verbal and communication, leisure or play activities, and \nlearning. Most often if untreated it results in lifelong mental retardation. \n59.  Plaintiff children receive medically necessary services, such as community mental health \nservices, from Step By Step Academy (SBSA) located in Worthington, Ohio under Ohio’s \nMedicaid program. \n60.  SBSA is a nationally accredited and state certified community mental health agency \ndedicated to providing mental health services to children with autism. \n61.  Services provided by SBSA include full day center-based applied behavior analysis \n(ABA), psychological assessments and diagnosis, parent advocacy and resource information \nand home outreach services including one-to-one services. \n62.  Plaintiff children benefit from receiving these medically necessary services from SBSA. \nBenefits include increased IQ levels, reduction in developmental disabilities, decrease in \n  9 \n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00421-JLG-NMK Doc #: 27 Filed: 06/24/08 Page: 10 of 16  PAGEID #: 688\nbehavioral outbursts, increase in on-task behaviors, decrease in self-stimulation behaviors, \nincreased communication skills, increased daily living skills such as toileting, dressing, food \npreparation, and a decreased chance of being placed in segregated special education \nclassrooms or institutional settings. \n63.  The services provided by SBSA result in maximum reduction of physical and mental \ndisabilities and restoration to the best possible functional level. \n64.  The services provided by SBSA to Plaintiff children are rehabilitative in nature. \n65.  The services provided by SBSA are recommended as a medical necessity for Plaintiff \nchildren by their physicians and / or other licensed practitioners. \n66.  In the past, Plaintiff children unsuccessfully tried to get these medically necessary \nservices from other providers. \n67.  ODJFS requested federal funding for services provided to Plaintiff children by SBSA, but \nCMS has deferred payment to ODJFS for such claims because, according to CMS, they are \nnot covered by Medicaid. \n68.  Plaintiff X.C. was told by several service providers that these were not appropriate \nplacements for him and that he should not return due to his severely dangerous and \naggressive behaviors. \n69.  Plaintiff K.W. was in a classroom in the Worthington City School District. If K.W. was \nbeing quiet and not acting out, he was left alone. There was not any interaction between \nK.W. and his teacher or other children. \n70.  Intensive behavioral intervention is a rehabilitative service with both medical and \nremedial components under 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(13).  \n  10 \n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00421-JLG-NMK Doc #: 27 Filed: 06/24/08 Page: 11 of 16  PAGEID #: 689\n71.  The Medicaid Act gives Plaintiff children an enforceable right to intensive behavioral \nintervention services. \n72.  Defendants promulgated rules, O.A.C. §§ 5101:3-27-02 and 5122-29-17, to be effective \nJuly 1, 2008. \n73.  O.A.C. § 5101:3-27-02 (eff. 7/1/08) lists services that are required to be rehabilitative in \nnature in order to be reimbursable under the State Medicaid plan as community mental health \nservices.  \n74.  Community psychiatric supportive treatment (CPST) service is listed as a community \nmental health service under O.A.C. § 5101:3-27-02 (eff. 7/1/08).  \n75.  O.A.C. § 5101:3-27-02(A) (eff. 7/1/08) states that “[r]ehabilitative services provide for \nthe maximum reduction of mental illness and are intended to restore an individual to the best \npossible functional level.” \n76.  O.A.C. § 5122-29-17 (eff. 7/1/08) defines CPST service as a rehabilitative service. \n77.  Defendants’ rules narrow the definition and eligibility for CPST services by creating an \noverly restrictive definition of ‘rehabilitative’ in violation of federal Medicaid provisions. \n78.  Defendants’ rules limit ‘rehabilitative’ services to individuals with “mental illness.\" This \ndefinition is more restrictive than the federal regulations because it excludes other physical \nand mental disabilities. \n79.  Plaintiff children will face a reduction or total loss of the services provided to them by \nSBSA in violation of 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a, 1396d(a) and 1396d(r)(5). \n80.  Plaintiffs have not found nor has the State offered services from an alternative provider. \n  11 \n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00421-JLG-NMK Doc #: 27 Filed: 06/24/08 Page: 12 of 16  PAGEID #: 690\n81.  Defendants’ rules are contrary to the State’s obligation to provide medically necessary \nservices to children that correct or ameliorate conditions under the federal Medicaid \nrequirements of EPSDT. \nCLAIM FOR RELIEF \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n82.  Plaintiffs restate and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 81 as if fully \nrewritten herein.  \n83.  Defendants have an obligation under 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10) to provide medical \nassistance, as defined in 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396d(a), to Plaintiff children.  \n84.  Medical assistance includes payment for EPSDT services. 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(4)(B). \nEPSDT provides for “such other necessary health care, diagnostic services, treatment, and \nother measures … to correct or ameliorate defects and physical and mental illnesses and \nconditions discovered by the screening services, whether or not such services are covered \nunder the State plan.” 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(r)(5). \n85.  Defendants’ violated 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10) by failing to provide for making medical \nassistance available under the sections cited in this cause of action to all Medicaid-eligible \nindividuals under the age of 21. \n86.  As a result of Defendants’ violation, Plaintiff children will suffer a loss or reduction in \nmedically necessary services provided to them under Medicaid. \n87.  Plaintiffs bring this action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 because Defendants Stephenson and \nJones-Kelley , acting under color of law, are depriving Plaintiffs of their rights under the \nlaws of the United States by promulgating rules which reduce services that are guaranteed to \n  12 \n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00421-JLG-NMK Doc #: 27 Filed: 06/24/08 Page: 13 of 16  PAGEID #: 691\nchildren under the EPSDT provisions in accordance with the federal Medicaid Act and \nimplementing regulations. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n88.  Plaintiffs restate and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 87 as if fully \nrewritten herein. \n89.  Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(43)(C), Defendants Stephenson and Jones-Kelley are \nobligated to arrange for (directly or through referral to appropriate agencies, organizations, or \nindividuals) providing corrective treatment for Plaintiffs. \n90.  Defendants’ rules, effective July 1, 2008, restrict the types of corrective treatment \nPlaintiffs can receive by narrowing the definition and scope of rehabilitative services that are \neligible for payment under Medicaid. \n91.  As a result of Defendants’ violation, Plaintiff children will suffer a loss or reduction in \nmedically necessary services provided to them under Medicaid. \n92.

Plaintiffs will not be receiving these services in a timely and /or reliable manner at all or \nto the extent necessary to correct or ameliorate their conditions once Defendants’ rules \nbecome effective July 1, 2008 because the rules limit services that are eligible for payment \nunder Medicaid.  \n97.  As a result of the change in rules, Defendants have failed to provide medical assistance \nwith reasonable promptness in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8). \n98.  Plaintiffs bring this action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 because Defendants Stephenson and \nJones-Kelley, acting under color of law, are depriving Plaintiffs of their rights under the laws \nof the United States by promulgating rules which reduce services that are guaranteed to \nchildren under the EPSDT provisions in accordance with the federal Medicaid Act and \nimplementing regulations.  \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \nPlaintiffs respectfully request that this Court grant the following relief: \nA.

Require Defendants Stephenson and Jones-Kelley to develop rules that comply with \nfederal Medicaid law; \nF.  Immediately enjoin Defendant Weems to comply with the orders of this court related to \nfederal Medicaid statutes and to cease all efforts to claim federal financial participation or \nmake findings in regard to Ohio's Medicaid program that would be in conflict with the \nrulings of this Court, and to further enjoin him to approve payment of federal financial \nparticipation for medically necessary services to correct or ameliorate Plaintiff children's \ndefects and physical and mental illnesses and conditions that are provided to Plaintiff \nchildren by any certified Medicaid provider chosen by the Plaintiffs or the members of the \nPlaintiff association; \nG.

For instance, the   \nState  argues  that  the  Plaintiffs  could  apply  for  a  For the reasons set forth herein, and as stated in this \nwaiver  or  could  seek  “pre-authorization”  for  Court's June 30, 2008 Order, the State's motion for \ncoverage of the services. This argument ignores the  stay (doc. 43) is DENIED. \nsubstantial impact that waiting for a waiver of pre-  \nauthorization would have on these children. The State \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nis well aware of the fact that the proposed rules will \n \nspecifically hinder what services can be rendered to \nS.D.Ohio,2008. \nthese children and has in fact taken steps to try to find \nParents  League  for  Effective  Autism  Services  v. \nother  arrangements  for  them  once  the  new  rules \nJones-Kelley \nwould be effective, which are not the equivalent of \nSlip Copy, 2008 WL 2796744 (S.D.Ohio) \nservices they were receiving under the current rules. \nSee, State's TRO Hearing Exs. W, Y, Z, and AA.   \n  END OF DOCUMENT \n \nD. The public interest is not served by a stay of the \ninjunction. \n \nCongress  mandated  that  the  EPSDT  services  be \nprovided to eligible children in the State of Ohio. In \nmaking the EPSDT provisions mandatory, Congress \nrecognized the need for making “services available so \nthat young people can receive medical care before \nhealth  problems  become  chronic  and  irreversible \ndamage occur.”See, Stanton v. Bond, 504 F.2d 1246, \n1249  (7th  Cir.1974)  (citing  Senate  and  House \nCommittee reports emphasizing the need for EPSDT \nservices). Early and effective treatment of children \nwith autism has been shown to provide significant \nimprovement, including the return of those children \nto the general community. See, Mulick Decl. at ¶ 11. \nThe public benefits from the treatment of children \nwith  medical  conditions.  Although  the  cost  of \nproviding care to autistic children appears daunting, \nthe potential that such care will have to be continued \nthroughout  adulthood  poses  a  potentially  larger \neconomic burden. See, Michelle LeMarche Decl. at ¶ \nA (studies show a savings of $1,000,000 per child \nover the child's lifetime by receiving necessary early \nintervention). \n \nEven  if  the  State's  obligation  to  pay  for  EPSDT \nservices is broad and expensive, it cannot use this as \nan excuse to ignore the requirements of the law. The \nState is obligated to comply with Federal Medicaid \nlaw and may not “characterize its duty to comply \nwith the requirements of an elective program such as \nMedicaid as constituting a hardship to its citizens.” \n ",

Plaintiff children are Medicaid eligible. They currently receive medically necessary \nservices funded through Medicaid from Step By Step Academy (SBSA) in Worthington, Ohio. \nDefendants have promulgated rules that govern the Medicaid program in Ohio. These rules limit \nthe services to be paid for by Medicaid in violation offederal law. As a result, providers \nauthorized by the state to deliver intensive behavioral health services to ehildren will lack the \nauthority, capacity and funds necessary to provide ongoing, intensive community based services \nto the Plaintiff children. Plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief to prevent the loss or \nreduction of medically necessary services to which they are entitled under federal law. \nJURISDICTION MTI VENUE \nL  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.c. § 133 I which provides for original \njurisdiction over civil suits arising under the Constitution, laws or treatises of the United \nStates and against Defendants acting under color of state law pursuant to 42 U.S.c. § \n1983. \n2.  This Court also has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1343(3) and (4) which provide for \noriginal jurisdiction of the Court in all suits authorized by 42 U.S.c. § 1983. Plaintiffs \nseek to enforce the rights guaranteed them under the United States Constitution and the \nfederal Medicaid laws, 42 U.S.c. §1396 et seq. and the implementing federal \nregulations. \n2 \n\n3.  In addition, this Court has jurisdiction over the Plaintiffs' claims for declaratory relief \npursuant to 28 U.S.c. §§ 2201 and 2202 and Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure. \n4.  Venue is proper in the Southern District of Ohio, Eastern Division, because the \ndefendants are located in this district within the meaning of28 U.S.c. § 1391(b) and \nbecause the events, acts and omissions giving rise to the Plaintiffs' claims occurred in \nthis district. \nPARTIES \nPLAINTIFFS \n5.

Defendant Helen Jones-Kelley, as director of Ohio Department of Job and Family \nServices (ODJFS), is responsible for the administration of the Medicaid program in Ohio. \n34. ODIFS is the single state agency for the Medicaid program in the State of Ohio and is \nrequired,pursuanttoO.R.C. § 5111.01 andO.A.C. § 5101:1-37-01, toprovidemedieal \nassistance in accordance with the federal Medicaid statute, Title XIX of the Social \nSecurity Act, 79 Stat. 286 (1965). \n35. As the executive head of ODJFS under O.R.C. § 5101.02, Defendant Jones-Kelley is \nresponsible for the supervision and operation of the Medicaid program in Ohio in \naccordance with the applicable federal Medicaid statutes and regulations. \n36. Defendant Jones-Kelley is also responsible for ensuring that other state and county \nagencies and subdivisions with whom ODJFS contracts to administer the Medicaid \nprogram comply with all applicable Medicaid laws and policies pursuant to O.R.C. § \n5111.01. \n37. Defendant Jones-Kelley has acted and continues to act at all times relevant hereto in her \nofficial capacity and under color of state law. \n38. Defendant Sandra Stephenson is the Director of Ohio Department of Mentai Health \n(ODHM). \n39. As chief executive and administrative officer of ODMH under O.R.C. § 5119.01, \nDefendant Stephenson is responsible for adopting rules that establish standards for \nservices provided by community mental health facilities. Defendant Stephenson has the \nauthority to enter into contracts and other agreements. \n6 \n\n40, As directors, Defendant Jones-Kelley and Defendant Stephenson entered into an inter \nagency agreement between ODJFS and ODMH for the purpose of establishing a sub \nrecipient relationship between the entities to implement 42 C.F.R. § 431 Part M and to \nprovide behavioral health services to people who are eligible for Ohio Medicaid benefits \nunder Title XIX of the Social Security Act, Interagency Agreement Between ODJFS and \nODMII, Article I, Section A. \n41. ODMH is considered the sub-recipient of the federal funds received from ODJI'S, and \nmental health service providers are considered sub-recipients of the funds recei ved from \nODMH. \n42, ODJFS, in consultation with ODMH, promulgates the Ohio Administrative Code rules \nthat govern the Medicaid program. \n43, Defendant Stephenson has acted and continues to act at all times relevant hereto in her \nofficial capacity and under color of state law. \nFACTS \n44. Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 79 Stat. 286 (1965), (\"the Medicaid Act\"), at 42 \nU.S.C. Sections 1396 et seq., was enacted as ajoint obligation by the federal government \nand participating states to provide medical assistance to low income and needy \nindividuals who would otherwise be unable to pay for necessary health care. States are \nnot required to participate, but oncc a state elects to participate in the program, it is bound \nby the federal law and regulations set forth in the Social Security Act and its \nimplementing regUlations. \n45. Title XIX of the Social Security Act lists twenty-seven services to be provided 10 \nindividuals who meet the qualifications listed in 42 U.S.c. § 1396d(a)(i)-(xiii). \n7 \n\n46.42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(43) requires participating states to include in their State Medicaid \nPlan a provision for the Early, Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) of \nall Medicaid eligible children under the age of twenty-one. \n47. The federal requirements for EPSDT are specifically detailed and require states to \nprovide \"such other necessary health care, diagnostic services, treatment, and other \nmeasures to correct or to ameliorate defects and physical and mental illnesses and \nconditions discovered by the screening services, whether or not sueh services are covered \nunder the State plan.\" 42 U.S.e. § 1396d(r)(5). \n48. The State of Ohio participates in the Federal Medicaid program, including the EPSDT \nprovIsIons. \n49. Ohio's EPSDT program is operated under the name \"Healthchek\" and is codified at \nOAe. §§ 5101:3-14-01 to 5101:3-14-22. \n50. Plaintiff children are Medicaid eligible individuals under age twenty-one who are eligible \nfor EPSDT services set forth under the federal Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)( 43) \nand 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(r) and Ohio's Healthchek Program set forth at OAe. §§ 5101:3-\n14-01 through 5101:3-14-22. \n5 L Plaintiff children have all becn diagnosed with a developmental disability on the autism \nspectrum. \n52. Autism is now seen as a spectrum disorder, \"Autism Spectrum Disorder\" (ASD). Autistic \ndisorder, the full-blown condition, is one of five disorders falling under the umbrella of \n\"Pervasive Developmental Disorder\" (PDD), a category of neurodevelopmental \ndisorders. POD includes the disorders commonly diagnosed as Asperger's Disorder, Rett \n8 \n\nSyndrome, Childhood Disintegrative Disorder, and PDD -Not Otherwise Specified \n(PDD-NOS). \n53. Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disability that generally appears during the first \nthree years oflife. It impacts the normal development of the brain, resulting in \nimpairments of social interaction, verbal and non-verbal and communication, leisure or \nplay activities, and learning. Most often if untreated it results in lifelong mental \nretardation. \n54. Plaintiff children receive medically necessary services, such as community mental health \nservices, from Step By Step Academy (SBSA) located in Worthington, Ohio under \nOhio's Medicaid program. \n55. SBSA is a nationally accredited and state certified community mental health agency \ndedicated to providing mental health services to children with autism. \n56. Services provided by SBSA include full day center-based applied behavior analysis \n(ABA), psychological assessments and diagnosis, parent advocacy and resource \ninformation and home outreach services including one-to-one services. \n57. Plaintiff children benefit from receiving these medically necessary services from SBSA. \nBenefits include increased lQ levels, reduction in developmental disabilities, decrease in \nbehavioral outbursts, increase in on-task behaviors, decrease in self-stimulation \nbehaviors, increased communication skills, increased daily living skills such as toileting. \ndressing, food preparation, and a decreased chance of being placed in segregated special \neducation classrooms or institutional settings. \n58. The services provided by SBSA result in maximum reduction of physical and mental \ndisabilities and restoration to the best possible functional level. \n9 \n\n59. The services provided by SBSA to Plaintiff children are rehabilitative in nature. \n60. The services provided by SBSA are recommended as a medical necessity for Plaintiff \nchildren by their physicians and / or other licensed practitioners. \n61. In the past, Plaintiff children unsuccessfully tried to get these medically necessary \nservices from other providers. \n62. PlaintiffX.C. was told by several service providers thai these were not appropriate \nplacements for him and that he should not return due to his severely dangerous and \naggressive behaviors. \n63. PlaintiffK.W. was in a classroom in the Worthington City School District. IfK.W. was \nbeing quiet and not acting out, he was left alone. There was not any interaction between \nK.W. and his teacher or other children. \n64. Intensive behavioral intervention is a rehabilitative service with both medical and \nremedial components under 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(13). \n65. The Medicaid Act gives Plaintiff children an enforceable right to intensive behavioral \nintervention services. \n66. Defendants promulgated rules, O.A.C. §§ 5101 :3-27-02 and 5122-29-17, to be effective \nJuly 1, 2008. \n67. O.A-C. § 5101:3-27-02 (eff. 7/1108) list services that are required to be rehabilitative in \nnature in order to be reimbursable under the State Medicaid plan as community mental \nhealth services. \n68. Community psychiatric supportive treatment (CPST) service is listed as a community \nmental health service under O.A.C. § 5101:3-27-02 (eff 7/1108). \n10 \n\n69. O.A.C. § 5101:3-27-02(A) (eff. 7/1108) states that H[r]ehabilitative services provide for \nthe maximum reduction of mental illness and are intended to restore an individual to the \nbest possible functional level.\" \n70. OAC. § 5122-29-17 (eff. 7/1108) defines CPST service as a rehabilitative service. \n71. Defendants' rules narrow the definition and eligibility for CPST services by creating an \noverly restrictive definition of 'rehabilitative' in violation of federal Medicaid provisions. \n72. Defendants' rules limit 'rehabilitative' services to individuals with \"mental illness.\" This \ndefinition is more restrictive than the federal regulations because it excludes other \nphysical and mental disabilities. \n73. Plaintiff children will face a reduction or total loss of the services provided to them by \nSBSA in violation of 42 U.S.c. §§ 1396a, 1396d(a) and 1396d(r)(5). \n74. Plaintiffs have not found nor has the State offered services from an alternative provider. \n75. Defendants' rules are contrary to the State's obligation to provide medieally necessary \nservices to children that correct or ameliorate conditions under the federal Medicaid \nrequirements of EPSDT. \nCLAIM FOR RELIEF \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n76. Plaintiffs restate and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 75 as if fully \nrewritten herein. \n77.42 U.S.C. § 1396d(r)(5), requires that Plaintiff children shall be provided \"such other \nnecessary health care, diagnostic services, treatment, and other measures ... to correct or \nameliorate defects and physical and mental illnesses and conditions discovered by the \nscreening services, whether or not such services are covered under the State plan.\" \n11 \n\n78. Defendants' rules limit the State plan by requiring that services are rehabilitative in \nnature. OAC. §§ 5101:3-27-02(A) and 5122-29-17(A)(eff. 711108). \n79. Defendants' rules also limit the State plan by restricting the meaning of rehabilitative to \nservices for mental illnesses only. OAC. § § 5101 :3-27-02(A) and 5122-29-l7(A)(e ff. \n711108). \n80. Defendants' rules ignore the \"correct or ameliorate defects and physical and mental \nillnesses and conditions\" language in the EPSDT provision of the Medicaid Act and \ninstead require that services 'restore' an individual to the best or highest possible \nfunctional level. OAC. §§ 5101:3-27-02(A) and 5122-29-17(A)(eff. 7/1108). \n8 L Defendants have an obligation to provide medical assistance as defined in 42 US.c. § \n1396d(a) to Plaintiff children regardless of what services are provided for in the State \nplan. \n82. As a result of Defendants' violation, Plaintiff children will suffer a loss or reduction in \nmedically necessary services provided to them under Medicaid. \n83. Plaintiffs bring this action under 42 U.S.c. § 1983 because Defendants, acting under \ncolor of law, are depriveing Plaintiffs of their rights under the laws of the United States \nby promulgating rules which reduce services that are guaranteed to children under the \nEPSDT provisions in accordance with thc federal Medicaid Act and implementing \nregulations. \nSECOl\\;TI CAUSE OF ACTION \n84. Plaintiffs restate and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 83 as if fully \nrewritten herein. \n12 \n\n85, 42 U,S,C, § 1396d(a) list services that are required to be provided to Plaintiff children \nbecause they are under the age of twenty-one. \n86, Services that are required to be provided to Plaintiff children include those listed in 42 \nU.S.c. §§ 1396d(a)(4)(B), 1396d(a)(6) and 1396(d)(a)(13), \n87. Specifically, 42 U.S,c. § 1396d(a)(13) provides that \"other diagnostic, screening, \npreventive, and rehabilitative services, ineluding any medical or remedial serviees \nrecommended by a physician or other licensed practitioner of the healing arts within the \nscope oftheir practice under State law, for the maximum reduction of physical or mental \ndisability and restoration of an individual to the best possible functionalleve1\" shall be \ncovered as medical assistance under Medicaid, (Emphasis added), \n88, Defendants' rules restrict the community mental health services that Plaintiff children can \nreceive by restricting services to those that are rehabilitative in nature and by limiting \nrehabilitative services to those that restore functioning, instead of including those that are \n'remedial' oreorreetive, O.A,C, §§ 5101:3-27-02(A) and 5122-29-17(A)(eff. 7/1108), \n89. The federal regulation, 42 C.F.R. § 440.130(d) defines rehabilitative services as \"any \nmedical or remedial service recommended by a physician or other licensed practitioner of \nthe healing arts, within the scope of his practice under State law, for maximum reduction \nof physical or mental disabi lity,\" (Emphasis added). \n90. Defendants' definition ofrehabilitative is much narrow than the federal definition. \nDefimdants' defmition requires that the recipient of the services have a \"mental illness\", \nO.A.C. §§ 5101:3-27-02(A) and 5122-29-17(A)(eff. 7/1/08), \n13 \n\n91. Defendants' rules violate 42 C.F.R. § 440.l30(d) by limiting the scope of rehabilitative \nserviees to those that reduce \"mental illness\" and ignoring other physieal and mental \ndisabilities. OAC, §§ 5101:3-27-02(A) and 5122-29-17(A)(eff. 7/1108). \n92. As a result of Defendants' violation, Plaintiff children will suffer a loss or reduction in \nmedically necessary community mental health services currently provided to them under \nMedicaid. \n93. Plaintiffs bring this action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 because Defendants, acting under \ncolor of law, deprived Plaintiffs oftheir rights under the laws of the United States by \npromulgating rules which reduce services that are guaranteed to children under the \nEPSDT provisions in accordance with the fe.deral Me.dicaid Act and implementing \nregulations. \nREQUEST FQR RELIEF \nPlaintiffs respectfully request that this Court grant the following relief: \nA.  Order Defendants to continue to provide and I or arrange for medically necessary \nservices, including 35-40 hours per week of applied behavior analysis, for Plaintiffs as \ndetermined by their physicians or other licensed practitioners; \nB.  Immediately enjoin Defendants from enforcing their proposed rules, O.A.c' §§ 5101:3-\n27-02 and 5122-29-17, that fail to comply with the requirements of federal Medicaid law \nwhich require services to be provided to Plaintiffs; \nC.  Declare that Defendants' rules violate Plaintiffs' rights under the federal Medicaid law by \nas alleged in this Complaint, and by requiring that c.ommunity mental health services be \nrehabilitative and limiting the types of services and defInition of rehabilitative to reducing \nsymptoms of mental illness; \n14 \n\nD.  Declare the Defendants' rules violate Plaintiffs' rights under federal Medicaid law \nbecause the rules do not allow medically necessary services to be provided that correct or \nameliorate defects and physical and mental illnesses and conditions; \nE.  Require Defendants to develop rules that comply with federal Medicaid law; \nF.  Grant Plaintiffs' recovery of reasonable attorney's fees and costs in bringing this action; \nG.  Grant Plaintiffs any and all other relief to which the Court believes they are entitled. \nRespectfully submitted, \nffV';,\\ {2HJlJe! LtlfJ {Ji!\\'IJ\\_-----,-:-=-:--::--:: \nMichelle F.

INTRODUCTION \n \n  Plaintiffs,  Parents’  League  for  Effective  Autism  Services  (“PLEAS”)  and  three \nindividuals receiving services at Step-by-Step Academy, Inc. (“SBSA”), seek to prevent two new \nadministrative rules from becoming effective on July 1, 2008.  All claims raised by PLEAS must \nbe dismissed for lack of standing.  Even if PLEAS had standing (and it does not), PLEAS should \nstill be dismissed because Plaintiffs’ counsel is prohibited from representing PLEAS. \n  Unless the remaining Plaintiffs consent to joining the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices (“CMS”), their claims must also be dismissed pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 19.  If those \nPlaintiffs do consent to joining CMS, their claims should be dismissed because they have not \nidentified any federal statute(s) enforceable through 42 U.S.C. §1983 that grant Plaintiffs a right \nto the relief they request.  Also, to the extent that they seek an order requiring Defendants to \nfurnish health care services, that claim for relief should be dismissed. \nII.  FACTS \n \n  Earlier this year, Defendants adopted two new administrative rules that are set to become \neffective on July 1, 2008.  See Ex. 1.  The first rule – Ohio Admin. Code 5101:3-27-02 (eff. \n7/1/08) – describes when the Ohio Medicaid program will cover community mental health \nservices.  The old rule stated that Ohio Medicaid would cover those services “when rendered by \neligible medicaid providers.”  Ohio Admin. Code 5101:3-27-02(A).  The new rule requires that \nthe  services  be  “rehabilitative”  and  defines  the  term  “rehabilitative.”    Id.    It  defines \n“rehabilitative services” as services that “provide for the maximum reduction of mental illness \nand are intended to restore an individual to the best possible functional level.”  Id.  This language \nparallels federal regulations which states that “rehabilitative services” include “any medical or \n\nremedial services recommended by a physician or other licensed practitioner of the healing arts, \nwithin the scope of his practice under State law, for maximum reduction of physical or mental \ndisability  and  restoration  of  a  recipient  to  his  best  possible  functional  level.”    42  C.F.R. \n§440.130(d). \n  The second rule – Ohio Admin. Code 5122-29-17 (eff. 7/1/08) – describes what services \nwill be considered to be community psychiatric supportive treatment (“Community Psych”) \nservices.  Ohio Admin. Code 5122-29-17 (eff. 7/1/08).  The new rules clarifies a number of \nprovisions in the old rule regarding the provision of Community Psych services.  In particular, it \nrequires that those services be rehabilitative and intended to restore an individual’s functioning \nto the highest possible level.  See Ohio Admin. Code 5122-29-17(A) (eff. 7/1/08).   \n  Neither of these rules prohibit health care providers from furnishing services addressed in \nother rules or prohibit Medicaid from covering services addressed in other rules.  Other rules \nallow for the provision and funding of a vast number of services to autistic children after the new \nrules become effective.  For example, autistic children can receive (and Medicaid will pay for) \npsychology  services,  hospital  services,  physician  services,  pharmaceutical  services,  durable \nmedical equipment, medical transportation, and outpatient therapy services (e.g., occupational \ntherapy, speech therapy, and physical therapy).  See Ohio Admin. Code 5101:3-8-05; 5101:3-2 et \nseq.; 5101:3-4 et seq.; 5101:3-9 et seq.; 5101:3-10 et seq.; 5101:3-15 et seq.  Many autistic \nchildren may also be eligible for “autism scholarships” that pay up to $20,000 per school year to \nprovide  special  education  and/or  related  services  that  implement  the  child’s  individualized \neducation program.  See R.C. 3310.41; Ohio Admin. Code 3301-51-01 through -30. \n  Plaintiffs allege that when the new rules go into effect, SBSA will be deprived of the \n“authority, capacity, and funds” necessary to provide “medically necessary services,” “applied \n  2\n\nbehavioral  analysis,”  “community  mental  health  services,”  “intensive  behavioral  health \nservices,”  and/or  “community  psychiatric  supportive  treatment.”    See  Compl.  at  p.1 \n(Introduction) and ¶¶6, 8, 13, 21, and 28, 54-57; Plaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Restraining \nOrder at 11.1  They further allege that Plaintiff children will be injured if they cannot obtain \nthese services.  Compl. at ¶7.  Therefore, Plaintiffs seek to enjoin enforcement of the new rules.  \nPlaintiffs’ Complaint should be dismissed for the reasons discussed below.   \nIII.  LAW AND ARGUMENT \n \nA.  Plaintiff  PLEAS  Should  Be  Dismissed  Because  It  Lacks  Association \nStanding. \n \n  Plaintiffs have the burden of showing they have standing to sue in federal court.  See, \ne.g., Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, \n454 U.S. 464, 472 (1982); Children’s and Parents Rights Ass’n of Ohio, Inc. v. Sullivan, 1991 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 8371 at *6 (N.D. Ohio 1991) (attached as Ex. 2).  If a plaintiff’s allegations of \njurisdictional facts are challenged in any appropriate manner, a plaintiff must support them by \ncompetent proof.  Children’s and Parents Rights Assn of Ohio, Inc., 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS at \n*6, citing McNutt v. General Motors Acceptance Corp., 298 U.S. 178, 189 (1936). \n  Plaintiff PLEAS lacks standing in its own right, because it is not a natural person and is \nnot entitled to Medicaid services or reimbursement.  See Compl. at ¶¶5-8.  PLEAS could have \nstanding if it could demonstrate that it has standing to assert its members’ rights, a concept often \nreferred to as “association standing.”  In order to show that it has association standing, PLEAS \nmust show that: 1) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; 2) the \ninterests it seeks to protect are germane to its purpose; and 3) neither the claims asserted nor the \n                                                 \n1 Because Plaintiffs have not indicated the specific types of services that make up these variously named service \nbundles, Defendants cannot determine precisely what types of services are at issue in this case (physician services, \npharmaceuticals, durable medical equipment, nursing services, etc.). \n  3\n\nrelief requested require the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.  See Natl. Rifle \nAssoc. v. Magaw, 132 F.3d 272, 294 (6th Cir. 1997), citing, Hunt v. Washington State Apple \nAdvertising Comm., 432 U.S. 333 (1977). \n  PLEAS cannot satisfy the third part of the association-standing test because the claims in \nthe Complaint involve fact-specific inquiries regarding the children and/or their legal guardians.  \nFor example, the Complaint alleges that without services from SBSA, PLEAS children are at risk \nof a regression in skills and an increase in unwanted behaviors and/or an increase in aggressive \nand dangerous behaviors.  Compl. at ¶¶7, 16, 24, and 32.  This allegation cannot be proven (or \ntested by Defendants) without the participation of the Plaintiff children and/or their guardians.  It \nmay be that some Plaintiff children could receive adequate services from other providers or \nprograms after the new rules become effective.  That will depend, in part, on the individual \nmedical  conditions  of  the  individual  Plaintiff  children.    Also,  the  Complaint  alleges  that \nPlaintiffs are currently seeking “medically necessary” services that they risk losing when the new \nrules become effective.  But whether a service is “medically necessary” involves complex fact-\nspecific inquiries into an individual’s medical condition and the specific services being sought.  \nSee Ohio Admin. Code 5101:3-1-01(A) regarding “general” definition of medical necessity.2  \nThis inquiry requires the participation of the individual Plaintiff children.   \n  Because the Plaintiff children must participate in the lawsuit, PLEAS lacks association \nstanding and should be dismissed.   \n \n                                                 \n2 There are a number of standards for determining whether an item or service is “medically necessary.”  Some items \nand services are subject to medical necessity standards that are specific to those items and services.  For example, \nhospital services, nursing facility therapy services, physical  medicine and rehabilitation services, psychology \nservices, chiropractic services, and numerous other Medicaid-covered services must meet specific criteria to be \n“medically necessary.”  See e.g., Ohio Admin. Code 5101:3-2-02(B)(4) (hospital services); 5101:3-3-47.1(A)(8) \n(nursing  facility  therapy  services);  5101:3-4-26(F)  (physical  medicine  and  rehabilitation  services);  5101:3-8-\n05(G)(9) (psychology services). \n  4\n\n  B.  Ohio Legal Rights Service Cannot Represent Plaintiff PLEAS. \n \n  Plaintiff PLEAS is represented by Ohio Legal Rights Service (“OLRS”).  OLRS has been \ndesignated as Ohio’s “protection and advocacy system” (“P&A system”) established by the \nDevelopmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (the “DDA”) and the Protection \nand Advocacy for Mentally Ill Individuals Act (the “PAIMI”).3  The DDA is codified at 42 \nU.S.C. §15001 through 15044 and the PAIMI is codified at 42 U.S.C. §10801 through 10807. \n  The DDA and the PAIMI do not permit OLRS to represent organizations.  They only \npermit it to represent individuals with mental illness or developmental disabilities.  See 42 U.S.C. \n§10805(a)(1);  10802(4)(B)(ii);  15043(a)(2)(A)(i);  15002(8)(A).    Ohio  law  implementing  the \nDDA and PAIMI limit OLRS to protecting and advocating the rights of: 1) mentally ill persons: \n2)  mentally  retarded  persons;  3)  developmentally  disabled  persons;  and  4)  other  disabled \npersons, provided OLRS is operating under a grant issued pursuant to R.C. 5123.60(F)(4). R.C. \n5123.60(A)(1). OLRS’ own rules expressly prohibit it from pursuing legal actions on behalf \nof individuals who are not disabled and/or mentally ill. See Ohio Admin. Code 5124-1-02(E) \n(“In carrying out the purposes identified in [the DDA and PAIMI], [O]LRS shall represent only a \nperson  who  has  or  has  been  alleged  to  have  mental  retardation  or  another  developmental \ndisability, or who is labeled as mentally ill.”) (attached as Ex. 12).4 OLRS is therefore prohibited \nfrom representing PLEAS. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n3 See Ohio Admin. Code 5124-1-02(D). \n4 This rule is current and accurate to the best of Defendants’ knowledge.  It is not available in paper form or any \nelectronic database known to Defendants.  It was provided by OLRS at Defendants’ request.   \n  5\n\nC.  The Complaint Should Be Dismissed Unless Plaintiffs Consent To Join CMS \nPursuant To Fed.R.Civ.P. 19. \n \n    1.  Standard For Joinder Pursuant To Fed.R.Civ.P. 19. \n  The question of whether a complaint must be dismissed for failure to join an a party \ninvolves a three-step process.  Ford v. Kreachbaum, 1992 WL 752897 (S.D. Ohio 1992) at *7 \n(ordering joinder of U.S. Secretary of Agriculture in §1983 action against Ohio Department of \nHuman Services) (attached as Ex. 3); Dorsey v. Tompkins, 917 F. Supp. 1195, 1200 (S.D. Ohio \n1996) (Graham, J.), citing, Keweenaw Bay Indian Community v. Michigan, 11 F.3d 1341, 1345 \n(6th Cir. 1993).  Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 19(a), a person who is subject to service of process and \nwhose joinder will not deprive the court of subject matter jurisdiction shall be joined if: 1) in the \nperson’s absence complete relief cannot be accorded among the existing parties, or 2) the person \nclaims an interest in the subject matter of the action and disposition of the action in his absence \nmay impair or impede his ability to protect that interest or create a substantial risk of double, \nmultiple or inconsistent obligations.  Ford, 1992 WL 752897 at *7.  If the person falls within \neither of these categories, the court must then consider the second issue of whether personal \njurisdiction is present.  Id.  If personal jurisdiction is present, the party must be joined. Id.  If \npersonal jurisdiction is not present, the court must take the third step of analyzing the factors in \nFed.R.Civ.P. 19(b) to determine whether the action may proceed without that party or whether \nthe action must be dismissed.  Id.  Defendants do not believe that it is necessary to analyze \nwhether the case should be dismissed pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 19(b) because the Court can \nexercise personal jurisdiction over CMS.  Courts have exercised jurisdiction over a variety of \nfederal administrative agencies pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 19.  See, e.g., Chicago Teachers Union \nv. Johnson, 639 F.2d 353, 358 (7th Cir. 1980) (ordering federal Secretary of Labor joined \npursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 19(a)); Ford v. Kreachbaum, 1992 WL 752897 at *9 (ordering federal \n  6\n\nDepartment of Agriculture joined pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 19(a); Lopez v. Arraras, 606 F.2d \n347, 353 (1st Cir. 1979) (ordering federal Department of Housing and Urban Development joined \npursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 19(a)).  Only if Plaintiffs refuse to consent to joining CMS should the \nComplaint must be dismissed pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(7). \n    2.  CMS Must Be Joined As A Defendant.  \n  CMS must be joined because: 1) complete relief cannot be afforded without CMS’ \npresence; and 2) CMS has a financial and policy stake in the outcome of this case and disposition \nof the case without CMS creates a risk of inconsistent obligations.   \n  CMS must be joined to provide complete relief because Defendants cannot pay for \nMedicaid services to the Plaintiff children without CMS.  Medicaid services are paid by a \ncombination of federal and state funds.  See Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 290 n.1 (1985).  \nCMS is responsible for paying the federal portion of Medicaid services.  CMS’ share of the \npayment varies depending on the particular service, but generally ranges from 50% to 83% of \namount of the service.  See Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System v. McClellan, 508 \nF.3d 1243, 1246 (9th Cir. 2007); 42 U.S.C. §1396d(b).  If the Court enjoins the new rules and \ndetermines that Plaintiffs are entitled to the services they seek, then Defendants will be required \nto pay for those services.  But CMS will not be required to do so unless it is joined as a party.  In \nthose circumstances, Defendants would be on the hook for millions of dollars, but CMS will not \nbe required to provide any federal funding.  Joinder is appropriate in such a situation.  See Lopez, \n606 F.2d at 352 (Court required joinder of Secretary of U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment when Secretary had the “final say as to the availability of requested funds.”  \nWithout the Secretary, any relief would be “hollow” and incomplete.). \n  7\n\n  Defendants face a very real risk of being Court-ordered payment and denied federal \nfunding.    ODJFS  has  already  requested  federal  funding  for  services  furnished  to  Plaintiff \nchildren by SBSA and CMS has “deferred” payment (i.e., not paid) for such services on the \ngrounds that they are “habilitative” and therefore not covered by Medicaid.  See March 21, 2008 \nletter from CMS to Defendant Helen Jones-Kelley, attached as Ex. 4; October 28, 2005 letter \nfrom CMS to former ODJFS Director Barbara Riley (explaining habilitative services not covered \nby Medicaid and denying ODJFS’ request of program providing habilitative services) (attached \nas Ex. 5).5  The Court can consider these materials without converting this Motion into a \nsummary judgment motion.  See, e.g., Colon v. Gonzalez, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23182 at *4 \n(Dist. P.R. 2008) (a party moving pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 19 may present, and the court may \nconsider, evidence outside the pleadings) (attached as Ex. 6). \n  The fact that the deferral decision is not a final action to withhold federal funding does \nnot preclude joinder.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 19 was designed to address practical considerations – not \nlegal formalities.  Provident Tradesmens Bank & Trust Co. v. Patterson, 390 U.S. 102, 117 n.12 \n(1968) (noting that the Committee revising Fed.R.Civ.P. 19 stressed that motions be reviewed on \n“practical  consideration”  and  “particular  consequences  of  the  proceeding.”).    The  practical \nreality in this case is that CMS’ concerns about the propriety of SBSA’s services are significant \nenough that it has taken the first step in withholding $496,121 of federal funds.  And that amount \nreflects federal funding for services furnished by SBSA for just one quarter of one year.  See Ex. \n4.  It is likely that CMS will examine other quarters and withhold millions of dollars of federal \nfunding.    If  that  happens,  Defendants  could  be  faced  with  the  conflicting  obligations  of \ncomplying with a Court order requiring payment for services furnished to Plaintiff children and \n                                                 \n5 Habilitative services are covered when provided through Medicaid waivers and in institutional settings.  However, \nPlaintiffs are not seeking any services through waivers or in institutional settings.   \n  8\n\ncomplying with a CMS decision denying payment for those same services (and possibly even an \nobligation to recover payments for past services furnished to Plaintiff children by SBSA).  There \nis  therefore  a  “substantial  risk”  that  proceeding  without  CMS  will  result  in  inconsistent \nobligations.  This provides an alternate basis for requiring joinder.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 19(a)(2). \nD.  The Complaint Should Be Dismissed Because Plaintiffs Have Not Alleged A \nRight Enforceable Through 42 U.S.C. §1983. \n \n  In order to state a valid §1983 claim, a plaintiff must assert a violation of a federal right, not \nmerely a violation of federal law.  Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329, 340 (1997) (citing Golden \nState Transit Corp. v. City of Los Angeles, 493 U.S. 103, 106 (1989).  The plaintiff has the burden \nof establishing that the statute at issue confers a “right” within the meaning of §1983.  To carry this \nburden, a plaintiff must show that: 1) the statutory provision in question is intended to benefit him; \n2)  the  provision  embodies  a  binding  obligation  on  the  governmental  unit  and  not  merely  a \ncongressional preference for a certain kind of conduct; and 3) the interest asserted is not so vague or \namorphous that it is beyond the competency of the judiciary to enforce.  Blessing, 520 U.S. at 340-\n341; Clark v. Portage County, 281 F.3d 602, 603 (6th Cir. 2002).  In order to show that statutory a \nprovision is intended to benefit him, a plaintiff must show an “individual entitlement” that is \n“unambiguously conferred” through the use of rights-creating language.  See Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, \n536 U.S. at 283-284, 287 (2002).  A statute with an “aggregate focus,” unconcerned with whether \nthe needs of the particular plaintiff have been satisfied, is insufficient.  See Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at \n288.  The statute must be phrased in terms of the persons benefited and use individual-focused \nterminology.  Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 287.   \n  Read liberally, the Complaint alleges that Plaintiffs are seeking to enforce rights found in 42 \nU.S.C.  §§1396a,  1396a(a)(43),  1396d(a),  1396d(a)(4)(B),  1396d(a)(6),  1396d(a)(13), \n1396d(r)(5), and/or “the Medicaid Act,” without reference to any particular provision of that Act.  \n  9\n\nComplaint at ¶¶ 46, 50, 73, and 85-87.  But these sections do not give Plaintiffs a “right” to the \nservices they seek – at least not one that is enforceable through 42 U.S.C. §1983. \n1.  42 U.S.C. §1396d Does Not Create Rights Enforceable Through 42 U.S.C. \n§1983. \n \n  None  of  the  sections  of  42  U.S.C.  §1396d  cited  by  Plaintiffs create rights  that are \nenforceable through 42 U.S.C. §1983.  Those sections contain definitions only.  See 42 U.S.C. \n§§1396d (entitled “definitions”), 1396d(a) (“the term ‘medical assistance’ means . . . ”), 1396d(r) \n(“the term ‘early periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment services means the following \nitems and services . . . ”).  As such, they cannot create enforceable rights.  See A.M.H. v. Hayes, \n2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27387 at *21 (S.D. Ohio 2004) (holding that 42 U.S.C. §1396d(a)(19) \nand §1396(d)(r)(5) do not create “private rights, or private causes of action” because they are \n“simply definitional”) (attached as Ex. 7); Health Care For All, Inc. v. Romney, 2004 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 26470 at *15 (Dist. Mass 2004) (holding that 42 U.S.C. §1396d(a)(4)(B) and §1396d(r) \ncannot be enforced through 42 U.S.C. §1983 because those “definitions do not articulate an \nobligation to be met” by the State) (attached as Ex. 8).  See also, 31 Foster Children v. Bush, 329 \nF.3d 1255, 1271 (11th Cir. 2003) (holding definitions in federal adoption act do not create rights \nenforceable through 42 U.S.C. §1983 and citing other cases).  Cases holding otherwise have not \napplied Gonzaga’s standards to these definitions and explained how definitions create show an \n“individual  entitlement”  that  is  “unambiguously  conferred”  through  the  use  of  rights-creating \nlanguage.  See, e.g., Pediatric Specialty Care Network v. Arkansas, 443 F.3d 1005, 1016 (8th Cir. \n2006) (concluding, in dicta,6 that 42 U.S.C. §1396d(a)(13) creates rights). \n \n                                                 \n6 The Eighth Circuit explained that decision was made based on the law-of-the-case doctrine because Gonzaga was \nnot an intervening decision of a superior tribunal.  Pediatric Specialty Care Network, 443 F.3d at 1014.  Therefore, \nthe Eighth Circuit’s statements regarding Gonzaga and rights pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1396d are dicta.  \n  10\n\n2.  An Allegation That 42 U.S.C. §1396a Or “the Medicaid Act,” Without \nCitation To A Subsection, Is Insufficient. \n \n  Plaintiffs cannot claim “rights” through 42 U.S.C. §1396a, in the abstract.  Blessing, supra, \nrequires plaintiffs to set forth the specific federal right, privilege or immunity that is allegedly being \nviolated.  Blessing, 520 U.S. 239, 242.  42 U.S.C. §1396a is a large statute, comprised of many \nsubparts.  Some of these subparts create rights enforceable through 42 U.S.C. §1983 and some do \nnot.    Without  identifying  which  part  of  42  U.S.C.  §1396a  is  at  issue,  Defendants  cannot \nmeaningfully respond to the alleged violation and the Court cannot determine whether the section in \nquestions creates enforceable rights pursuant to Blessing and Gonzaga.  Therefore, Plaintiffs’ claims \nalleging violations of 42 U.S.C. §1396a and “the Medicaid Act” must be dismissed.  See National \nChild Support v. Hayes, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9355 at *13-14 (S.D. Ohio, 2005) (dismissing 42 \nU.S.C. §1983 claim because plaintiff failed to identify specific statute it alleged defendant \nviolated) (attached as Ex. 9). \n3.  42 U.S.C. §1396a(a)(43) Does Not Confer Rights That Plaintiffs Seek To \nEnforce. \n \n  42 U.S.C. §1396a(a)(43) does not grant Plaintiffs a right to the relief they seek in this case.  \nThat statute states that State Medicaid assistance plans must do four things: 1) inform appropriate \nindividuals of the availability of early periodic screening, diagnosis, and screening (“EPSDT”) \nservices and the need for age-appropriate immunizations; 2) provide or arrange for the provision of \nscreening services in all cases where they are requested; 3) arrange for “corrective treatment” the \nneed  for  which  is  disclosed  by  such  child  health  screening  services;  and  4)  report  certain \ninformation  to  the  Secretary  of  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services.    42  U.S.C. \n§1396a(a)(43)(A) – (D).  That statute does not obligate Defendants to provide or pay for the \n  11\n\nservices  defined  in  1396d(a)  (defining  “medical  assistance”),  1396d(a)(4)(B)  (same), \n1396d(a)(6)(same), 1396d(a)(13)(same), or 1396d(r)(5) (defining “EPSDT services”). \n  The Sixth Circuit has held that 42 U.S.C. §1396a(a)(43) creates rights enforceable through \n42 U.S.C. §1983.  See Westside Mothers v. Olszewski, 454 F.3d 532, 540 (6th Cir. 2006).  But the \n“right” found under 42 U.S.C. §1396a(a)(43) in that case was the right to be effectively informed \nof the availability of EPSDT services.  See Westside Mothers, 454 F.3d at 544.  In this case, \nPlaintiffs seek services and/or payment for services alleged to be “medical assistance” and/or \n“EPSDT  services.”    42  U.S.C.  §1396a(a)(43)  does  not  confer  rights  to  those  services.    If \nPlaintiffs wish to allege that other statutes give them the right to such services, Plaintiffs must \namend the Complaint and identify such sections so that their claims are clearly stated for the \nrecord and Defendants have an opportunity to test the adequacy of those allegations before this \nCourt and on appeal, if necessary. \nE.  The Complaint Should Be Dismissed To The Extent It Seeks To Compel \nDefendants To Furnish Actual Health Care Services. \n   \n  The  Complaint  should  be  dismissed  to  the  extent  that  it  seeks  an  order  requiring \nDefendants to furnish health care services.  See Compl. at Request for Relief (A).  Medicaid laws \ndo not require States to furnish actual health care or other services.  Westside Mothers v. \nOlszewski, 454 F.3d 532, 540 (6th Cir. 2006); Bruggeman v. Blagovitch, 324 F.3d 906, 910 (7th \nCir. 2003); Mandy R. v. Owens, 464 F.3d 1139, 1146 (10th Dist. 2006).  \nF.  Plaintiffs Cannot Sue For Alleged Violations Of Regulations Through 42 \nU.S.C. §1983. \n   \n  Plaintiffs claim that Defendants violated 42 C.F.R. § 440.130(d).  Compl. at ¶91.  That \nclaim must be dismissed, along with any other claims based on alleged violations of regulations.  \nUntil recently, it was questionable whether regulations could create rights enforceable through \n  12\n\n42 U.S.C. §1983.  Federal circuit courts were split on this issue.  The U.S. Courts of Appeals for \nthe Third, Fourth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits held that federal regulations could not create \nrights enforceable through 42 U.S.C. §1983.  Save Our Valley v. Sound Transit, 335 F.3d 932, \n936 (9th Cir. 2003).  The U.S. Courts of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and the D.C. Circuit held \nthat federal regulations could create rights enforceable through 42 U.S.C. §1983.  See Loschiavo \nv. City of Dearborn, 33 F.3d 548 (6th Cir. 1994) Samuels v. District of Columbia, 770 F.2d 184 \n(D.C. Cir. 1985).  However, both Loschiavo and Samuels were decided before the U.S. Supreme \nCourt cases Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275 (2001), and Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S. \n273 (2002).  Read together, Sandoval and Gonzaga clearly hold that federal regulations cannot \ncreate rights enforceable through 42 U.S.C. §1983. \nIn Sandoval, the U.S. Supreme Court considered allegations that the Alabama Department \nof Public Safety violated Title VI and its implementing regulations by administering its driver’s \nlicense examination in English only.  Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 278-279.  The Sandoval plaintiffs \nclaimed that the implementing regulations created an implied right of action that permitted them to \nsue to enforce the implementing regulations.  Id.  The Sandoval Court rejected this claim, stating: \nThe judicial task is to interpret the statute Congress has passed to determine whether \nit displays an intent to create not just a private right but also a private remedy.  \nStatutory intent on this latter point is determinative.   \n \nSandoval, 532 U.S. at 286-287 (emphasis added) \n \nLanguage in a regulation may invoke a private right of action that Congress through \nstatutory text created, but it may not create a right that Congress has not.   \n \nSandoval, 532 U.S. at 291 (emphasis added).   \n \nIt is most certainly incorrect to say that language in a regulation can conjure up a \nprivate cause of action that has not been authorized by Congress.  Agencies may \nplay the sorcerer’s apprentice, but not the sorcerer himself.   \n \nSandoval, 532 U.S. at 291.   \n  13\n\n \nLike substantive federal law itself, private rights of action to enforce federal law \nmust be created by Congress.   \n \nSandoval, 532 U.S. at 286.  \n   \nThese statements clearly show that federal regulations cannot create implied rights of action.   \nSuch rights must be created by Congress, through language in federal statutes. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court explicitly adopted this logic and applied it to §1983 cases in \nGonzaga.  The Gonzaga Court stated: \nWe now reject the notion that our implied right of action cases are separate and \ndistinct from our §1983 cases.  To the contrary, our implied right of action cases \nshould guide the determination of whether a statute confers rights enforceable under \n§1983.   \n \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283 (emphasis added).   \n \nWe have recognized that whether a statutory violation may be enforced through \n1983 “is a different inquiry than that involved in determining whether a private right \nof action can be implied from a particular statute.”  But the inquiries overlap in one \nmeaningful  respect  –  in  either  case  we  must  first  determine  whether  Congress \nintended to create a federal right.   \n \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283 (citation omitted and emphasis added). \n \n  Since Sandoval and Gonzaga, at least one U.S. Supreme Court case has explicitly stated that \nfederal statutes – and not federal regulations – can create rights that are individually enforceable \nthrough 42 U.S.C. §1983.  See City of Rancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, 544 U.S. 113, 120 (2005) \n(“Accordingly, to sustain a §1983 action, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the federal statute \ncreates an individually enforceable right in the class of beneficiaries to which he belongs.”). \nOther circuit courts have followed suit.  The First and Fifth Circuits have recognized that \nSandoval and Gonzaga stand for the proposition that federal regulations cannot create rights that are \nenforceable through 42 U.S.C. §1983.  S.D. v. Hood, 391 F.3d 581, 603 (5th Cir. 2004).  See also \n  14\n\nBonano v. East Caribbean Airline Corp., 365 F.3d 81, 84 (1st Cir. 2004).7  See also, Save Our \nValley, 335 F.3d at 943 (“Plaintiffs suing under §1983 must demonstrate that a statute – not a \nregulation – confers an individual right.”). \nThe Sixth Circuit has retreated from its position in Loschiavo by stating that Sandoval \nand Gonzaga “have cabined Loschiavo’s holding” and implied that it would have overruled \nLoschiavo, but that a procedural rule prevented it from doing so.  See Caswell v. City of Detroit \nHousing Comm., 418 F.3d 615, 618 (6th Cir. 2005).  In a footnote following its statement that \nSandoval and Gonzaga “cabined” the Loschiavo holding, the Sixth Circuit stated that it could not \noverrule the decision of another panel [i.e., the Loschiavo panel], but that it could modify prior \nholdings when an intervening opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court requires it to do so.  Caswell, \n418 F.3d at 618, n. 1.  Furthermore, district court cases from within the Sixth Circuit indicate that \nthe Sandoval and Gonzaga cases have overruled the Sixth Circuit’s former holdings that federal \nregulations can create rights that are enforceable through 42 U.S.C. §1983.  See, e.g., Great Lakes \nConsortium v. Michigan, 480 F. Supp.2d 977, 984 (W.D. Mich. 2007) (“As the courts recently have \nmade  clear,  however,  an  enforceable  right  may  not  be  inferred  from  regulations  alone.”); \nAlmendares v. Palmer, 284 F. Supp.2d 799, 809 (N.D. Ohio 2003)“[r]egulations cannot be used as \na basis for creating a private cause of action unless there is a statute that establishes such a \nright.”); Johnson v. City of Detroit, 319 F. Supp.2d 756, 761 n.4 (E.D. Mich. 2004 (“As discussed \nin  more  detail  below,  the  Sixth  Circuit’s  rule  which  holds  that  regulations  alone  can  create \nenforceable federal rights under §1983 may no longer be viable in light of recent Supreme Court \ndecisions” (citing Gonzaga and Sandoval)). \n                                                 \n7 This non-1983 case held that federal regulations cannot create a private right of action.  However, because \nGonzaga explicitly stated that private-right-of-action cases should guide the determination of whether a statute \nconfers rights enforceable through §1983, this case is relevant to the discussion.   \n  15\n\n  In short, it is clear that after Gonzaga and Sandoval, federal regulations cannot create \nrights that are enforceable through §1983.  And, of course, no state laws can enforced through \n§1983.8  Therefore, all §1983 claims alleging violations of state laws or federal regulations must \nbe dismissed. \nIV.  CONCLUSION \n \n  The Court should dismiss the Complaint because Plaintiffs have not identified a federal \nstatute creating “rights” that Plaintiffs seek to enforce through 42 U.S.C. §1983.  If the Court \ndoes not dismiss the Complaint, it should dismiss PLEAS as a party, dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims \nbased alleged violations of state or federal regulations, and dismiss the Complaint to the extent it \nseeks to compel Defendant to furnish actual health care or other services. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nTHOMAS R.
