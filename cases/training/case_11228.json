Plaintiff sued for damages. </p><p>The plaintiff was a Registered Nurse who worked at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. On April 12, 2008, she left the hospital at approximately 7:35 p.m. and began her commute home. The police had blocked an exit ramp on I-83 North because of accident with a patrol car and road flares.  The plaintiff drove over the road flares. The officer entered his patrol vehicle and followed the plaintiff 4/10ths of a mile, and with weapon drawn, ordered the plaintiff to the ground.  Plaintiff was arrested for minor traffic violations.

Plaintiff,  Rosemary  Munyiri,  by  and  through  her  attorneys,  Robert  D. \nSchulte, Alan J. Booth, and Schulte Booth, P.C., hereby sues the defendants herein to \nredress violations of her civil and legal rights under the United States Constitution and \n42 USC § 1983.  In support thereof, Plaintiff states as follows: \nNature of the case \n  2.  Plaintiff,  a  Registered  Nurse  working  at  Johns  Hopkins  Hospital,  was \narrested following a routine traffic stop while traveling home on her daily commute by \nBaltimore City Police Officer Peter M. Haduch, Jr.  \n  3.  During  the  arrest,  Plaintiff  was  forced  at  gunpoint  to  alight  from  her \nvehicle, ordered to lay face down on the wet pavement of northbound I-83, handcuffed, \nand placed in officer Haduch’s patrol car for approximately 2 ½ hours.   \n  4.  Thereafter, Plaintiff was transported to Baltimore City’s Central Booking & \nIntake Facility (“CBIF”), taunted by Officer Haduch, and subject to a humiliating strip and \ncavity search by CBIF personnel.   \n  5.  Plaintiff now suffers from diagnosed depression, fear, and sleeplessness \nand has lost days from work as a result. \n  6.  This lawsuit is principally a civil rights action for money damages against \nthe  Baltimore  City  Police  Department,  the  Baltimore  City  Police  Commissioner, \nFrederick H. Bealefeld, Baltimore City Police Officer Peter M. Haduch, Jr., the Maryland \nDepartment of Safety and Correctional Services, its Secretary, Gary D. Maynard, the \nacting Warden of the CBIF, Naomi Williams, and as yet unknown Correctional Officers \n1 \n \n\nemployed by the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Corrections designated, for \nthe purposes of this Complaint, as John and Jane Doe. \n  7.  The arrest of Rosemary Munyiri on April 12, 2008 was without probable \ncause, and with excessive force and her subsequent strip search and visual body cavity \nsearch was done pursuant to customs, policies and practices adopted by the Mayor and \nCity  Counsel  of  Baltimore,  the  Baltimore  City  Police  Department,  the  Maryland \nDepartment  of  Public  Safety  and  Correctional  Services  and/or  the  CBIF  but  was \notherwise initiated by Baltimore City Police Officer Peter M. Haduch, Jr. and conducted \nwithout any reasonable belief by State officers, agents and/or officials that the arrest of \nRosemary Munyiri and subsequent strip and cavity search was without probable cause \nand/or constitutionally permissible. \nJurisdiction & Venue\n  8.  This action is brought pursuant to 42 USC §§ 1983, 1988 and the Fourth, \nFifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. \n  9.  Jurisdiction is founded upon 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 & 1343. \nParties\n  10.  At all times relevant, Plaintiff, an African female of Kenyan descent, was a \nresident  of  Baltimore  County,  State  of  Maryland,  although  all  acts  and  omissions \nprompting this Complaint and Jury Trial Demand occurred in the City of Baltimore. \n  11.  At all times relevant, Defendant, Peter M. Haduch, Jr., a Caucasian male, \nwas a resident of the State of Maryland, an employee of the Baltimore City Police \nDepartment and, therefore, an employee of the State of Maryland.  He is sued in his \nindividual and official capacity. \n2 \n \n\n  12.  At all times relevant, Defendants, John Doe and Jane Doe, were residents \nof the State of Maryland, employees of the Maryland Department of Public Safety and \nCorrectional Services and, therefore, employees of the State of Maryland. They are \nsued in their individual and official capacities. \n  13.  At  all  times  relevant,  Defendant,  Baltimore  City  Police  Commissioner \nFrederick H. Bealefeld was a resident of the State of Maryland and an employee of the \nBaltimore City Police Department. He is sued in his individual and official capacity. \n  14.  At all times relevant, Defendant, Naomi Williams, the acting Warden of \nCBIF,  was  a  resident  of  the  State  of  Maryland  and  an  employee  of  the  State  of \nMaryland.   She is sued in her individual and official capacity. \n  15.  At all times relevant, Defendant, the Baltimore City Police Department, \nwas and is an agency of the State of Maryland, but otherwise a local government under \nMd. Code Ann. (2007) § 5-301(d)(21) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article and \nsubject to suit under 42 USC § 1983. \n  16.  At all times relevant, Defendant, the Baltimore City Police Department, \npromulgated policies, practices, and procedures, employed by and/or relied upon by its \npolice officers resulting in the conduct that led to the injuries complained of by Plaintiff in \nthis Complaint. \n  17.  At all times relevant, the Department of Public Safety and Correctional \nServices was and is an agency of the State of Maryland. \n  18.  At  all  times  relevant,  the  State  of  Maryland,  through  its  agency,  the \nMaryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, promulgated policies, \n3 \n \n\npractices, and procedures, employed by and/or relied upon by its correctional officers \nresulting in the conduct complained of by Plaintiff in this Complaint.  \n  19.  At all times relevant, Defendant Peter M. Haduch, Jr. was acting in his \nofficial capacity as a Baltimore City Police Officer and under color of State law. \n  20.  At all times relevant, Defendant Frederick H. Bealefeld was acting in his \nofficial capacity as the Baltimore City Police Commissioner and under color of State law. \n  21.  At all times relevant, Defendant Naomi Williams was acting in her official \ncapacity as the acting warden of the CBIF and under color of State law. \n  22.  At all times relevant, Defendants, John Doe and Jane Doe were acting in \ntheir official capacities as correctional officers employed by the Maryland Department of \nPublic Safety and Correctional Services and under color of State law. \n  23.  Defendant Mayor and City Council of Baltimore (\"City of Baltimore\" or \n\"City\") is a municipal corporation with power to sue or be sued in any court. \n  24.  Defendant Baltimore City Police Department is, for the purposes of 42 \nUSC § 1983, a local government entity. \n  25.  Defendant Baltimore City Police Commissioner Frederick H. Bealefeld is \nappointed by the Mayor of the City of Baltimore; the organizational chart of the City of \nBaltimore lists the Baltimore City Police Department as a department of Baltimore City; \nthe Baltimore City Police Department is under the control of Baltimore City; and officers \nof the Baltimore City Police Department perform police functions typical of a municipal, \nnot state, government police department. \n   26.  Defendant Baltimore City Police Department is, for all relevant legal and \npractical purposes herein, part of the government of the City of Baltimore. For the \n4 \n \n\npurposes of this Complaint, Baltimore City Police Department is intended to include the \nMayor and City Council of Baltimore and Baltimore City, both of whom have plenary \ncontrol over the Baltimore City Police Department. \n  27.  At all times relevant, all Defendants were acting under the color of the \nlaws,  statutes,  ordinances,  rules,  regulations,  customs  and  usages  of  the  State  of \nMaryland.1   \n  28.  At all times relevant, all Defendants had an affirmative duty, but otherwise \nfailed, to protect Ms. Munyiri from harm, including and especially, the risk of violation of \nher constitutional rights. \nFacts\n  29.  Plaintiff, Rosemary Munyiri, serves as a Registered Nurse with the Johns \nHopkins Hospital System and works at the main campus facility located in the Broadway \ncorridor of Baltimore City. \n  30.  Ms. Munyiri regularly works a Twelve (12) hour shift, ordinarily beginning \nat 7 AM and ending at 7 PM. \n  31.  On  April  12,  2008,  Ms.  Munyiri  worked  her  normal  shift  and  left  the \nhospital  at  approximately  7:35  PM  anticipating  her  daily  commute  home  to  her \nresidence in the Pikesville area of Baltimore County.   \n  32.  She was attired in her pink hospital scrubs at the time. \n                                                 \n1 Although at present Plaintiff does not assert any State law claims, all notices required by Md. \nCode Ann. (2008) § 5-304 Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article and Md. Code Ann. (2008) § \n12-106 of the State Government Article were given in person or by certified mail, return receipt \nrequested, bearing a postmark from the United States Postal Service, by the undersigned counsel \nto, respectively, the Baltimore City Solicitor and to the State Treasurer.  Those notices and the \nattendant State procedural requirements are inapplicable to actions brought solely under 42 USC \n§ 1983.  See, e.g., Felder v. Casey, 487 U.S. 131 (1988). \n5 \n \n\n  33.  Ms. Munyiri stands roughly five (5) feet two (2) inches tall and is very \npetite. \n  34.  Leaving the hospital, she proceeded west on Madison Street.           \n  35.  Unbeknownst to Ms. Munyiri, an accident had occurred some time prior in \nthe area of I-83 North and North Avenue.   \n  36.  As a result, a number of Baltimore city police officers were dispatched to \nblock a number of entrance ramps to Northbound I-83. \n  37.  One such officer was Defendant Baltimore City Police Officer Peter M. \nHaduch, Jr. \n  38.  Officer Haduch had initially positioned his marked patrol car across the \nMadison Street entrance ramp to I-83 North (“the Madison Street Ramp”). \n  39.  Shortly thereafter, a civilian vehicle attempted to bypass Officer Haduch’s \nPatrol Car by driving over a wide, low curb adjacent to and slightly behind where the \nOfficer’s car was positioned. \n  41.  Officer Haduch uneventfully turned the civilian vehicle away and did not \narrest or otherwise cite the driver of that vehicle. \n  42.  Thereafter, Officer Haduch repositioned his patrol car from the entrance \nramp onto the wide, low curb immediately  adjacent to it with his emergency lights \nactivated and with his vehicle facing North and away from traffic which would otherwise \nbe approaching the area. \n  43.  According to Officer Haduch, he placed five (5) road flares across the \nMadison Street Ramp, which would have placed the flares to the left side of his patrol \n6 \n \n\ncar and his patrol vehicle between the flares and any vehicles approaching from the \nEast on Madison Street. \n  44.  On April 12, 2008, at about the time Officer Haduch was performing these \nfunctions, the weather was cloudy and there was considerable precipitation falling, with \nambient temperatures around 50 degrees.   \n  44.  Approximately  25  minutes  after  Officer  Haduch  allegedly  placed  road \nflares across the Madison Street Ramp, Ms. Munyiri approached from the East the \nintersection of the Madison Street Ramp and East Madison Street. \n  45.  She proceeded up the Ramp in the normal course as it was not blocked \nby Officer Haduch’s Patrol Vehicle or by any other physical barrier. \n  46.  Ms. Munyiri  observed no road flares across the Madison Street Ramp. \n  47.  Immediately thereafter, and with his emergency light still activated, Officer \nHaduch proceeded up the ramp with the intention to stop Ms. Munyri’s vehicle – a late \nmodel Toyota RAV4. \n  48.  According to Officer Haduch, he intended to force Ms. Munyiri onto the \nshoulder of I-83 North and into the concrete barrier wall which runs along side the \nroadway. \n  49.  Once Ms. Munyiri understood that Officer Haduch wished her to stop, she \ndid. \n  50.  The entire distance traversed by Ms. Munyiri’s vehicle from the beginning \nof the Madison Street Ramp to the point where she stopped was 4/10th of one (1) mile. \n  51.  The entire distance that Officer Haduch pursued Ms. Munyiri was less \nthan 4/10th of one (1) mile. \n7 \n \n\n  52.  The approximate distance from the beginning of the Madison Street Ramp \nto the point on I-83 North where the shoulder is sufficiently wide enough to pull a vehicle \nover outside the right hand lane of traffic is approximately 4/10th of one (1) mile. \n  53.  According to Officer Haduch, once Ms. Munyri’s vehicle was stopped, the \nOfficer “stepped from [his] car . . . [with its] lights and siren [] still on.”    \n  54.  He then proceeded to draw his service weapon for his “own safety” and \nproceeded to the rear of his vehicle to use “the trunk of [his] car for cover,” all the while \npointing his service weapon at Ms. Munyiri. \n  55.  With his siren still wailing and from a position of “cover” behind his patrol \ncar, Officer Haduch then “shouted orders [for Ms. Munyiri] to turn off the vehicle.”   \n  56.  The Officer apparently had to shout his orders at least “10 times” before \nMs. Munyiri complied.   \n  57.  While continuing to hold Ms. Munyiri at gunpoint, the Officer thrice ordered \nMs. Munyuri to throw her keys from the vehicle, which she did. \n  58.  Officer Haduch then ordered Ms. Munyiri to exit her vehicle and lay prone \nand face down on the ground, which she also did.    \n  59.  Thereafter, the Officer holstered his weapon, handcuffed Ms. Munyiri and \nplaced her in his patrol car where she apparently sat for several hours in 50 degree \nweather with the windows down in her light and now wet work attire.   \n  60.  During their time together in the patrol car, Officer Haduch was rude, \noffensive, and repeatedly ridiculed Ms. Munyiri, including telling her that “after tonight \nyou will not have a drivers’ license” and that she would otherwise never drive again. \n8 \n \n\n  61.  Subsequent to her arrest, Ms. Munyiri’s person, purse and her vehicle \nwere searched at the scene.  \n  62.  No weapons were found.  \n  63.  No contraband was found.   \n  64.  Ms. Munyri was found to have no criminal record. \n  65.  Ms. Munyiri was found to have no outstanding warrants. \n  66.  Ms. Munyiri was found to have no points on her driver’s license. \n  67.  Ms.  Munyiri  was  found  to  be  possessed  of  a  valid  Maryland  driver’s \nlicense. \n  68.  Ms. Munyiri was found to be possessed of a valid Maryland registration for \nher vehicle. \n  69.  Officer Haduch confirmed Ms. Munyiri’s identity at the time of her arrest. \n  70.  Prior  to  April  12,  2008,  Ms.  Munyiri  had  never  been  arrested  for  any \nreason.   \n  71.  Officer Haduch charged Ms. Munyiri with three (3) misdemeanor traffic \noffenses – “negligent driving,” “failure of driver to curb upon signal by police vehicle,” \nand “attempt by driver to elude uniformed police by failing to stop.”2\n  72.  After  Officer  Haduch  completed  his  Statement  of  Probable  Cause,  he \ntransported Ms. Munyiri to the Baltimore City Central Booking and Intake Center where \nshe continued to suffer his and others’ ridicule, including comments about what color \n                                                 \n2 The bulk of the factual information contained in paragraph 29 through 71 of Plaintiff’s \nComplaint is based upon Officer Haduch’s own Statement of Probable Cause which he used to \n“justify” the stop, arrest, and detention of Rosemary Munyiri.  \n9 \n \n\nprison garb would look best on her and whether or not Ms. Munyiri’s hair was her own \nor the product of “hair extensions.” \n  73.  As a former “liaison officer” between the Baltimore City Police Department \nand the CBIF operated by the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional \nServices, Officer Haduch specifically knew what would happen to Ms. Munyiri at the \nCBIF and intended that she be subjected to the events that she was following her \narrest,  including  an  unconstitutional  strip  and  body  cavity  search  of  her  person.       \n  74.  Officer Haduch acted with malice towards Ms. Munyiri. \n  75.  Upon entering the CBIF in the custody of Officer Haduch, Ms. Munyiri was \ngreeted by a CBIF nurse who took her vital signs and who informed Ms. Munyiri that \nshe would be “stripped.” \n  75.  Thereafter, Ms. Munyiri, in the presence of Officer Haduch, was informed \nof the charges against her. \n  76.  A few minutes later, Ms. Munyri was escorted by CBIF correctional officers \nJane Doe and/or John Doe to a CBIF room, along with other prisoners and, in the \npresence of those other prisoners, was ordered to disrobe to the point where she was \ncompletely naked. \n  77.  Ms. Munyuri then had her hair physically searched by Jane Doe and/or \nJohn Doe. \n  78.  Ms. Munyuri was then ordered by  Jane Doe and/or John Doe, in the \npresence of other CBIF personnel and other prisoners, to squat. \n  79.      Ms. Munyuri was then ordered, in the presence of other CBIF personnel \nand other prisoners, to cough. \n10 \n \n\n  80.      Ms. Munyuri was then ordered, in the presence of other CBIF personnel \nand other prisoners, to spread her buttocks exposing her anus and vaginal areas. \n  81.  Thereafter, Ms. Munyiri was put in holding cell. \n  82.  Approximately twenty-four (24) hours later, Ms. Munyiri was released on \nbond.           \n  83.  A friend of Ms. Munyiri posted bond on her behalf. \n  84.  On July 2, 2008, the State entered a plea of Nolle Prosequi with respect to  \nall charges against Ms. Munyiri after Officer Haduch, the State’s only witness to Ms. \nMunyiri’s alleged violations, failed to appear for trial. \nCount I – 42 USC 1983 \nMunyiri v. Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correction Services \n \n  85.  The  Plaintiff  repeats  and  realleges  Paragraphs  1  through  84  of  the \nComplaint as if more fully set forth herein. \n  86.  The errant policy and/or custom and practice of the Maryland Department \nof Public Safety and Correctional Services of strip searching and conducting visual body \ncavity searches of all men and women taken into custody, including Plaintiff Rosemary \nMunyiri,  violates  the  United  States  Constitution,  the  Constitution  of  the  State  of \nMaryland, and Federal and State Law. \n  87.  By the actions described above, the Defendant has deprived the Plaintiff \nof her clearly established rights guaranteed by, among other things, the Constitution of \nthe United States to be free from an unreasonable search and seizure. \n  88.  The Defendant, Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional \nServices, by and through its agents, servants, and/or employees, knowingly and with \ndeliberate  indifference  to  the  constitutional  rights  of  Ms.  Munyiri,  maintained  and \n11 \n \n\npermitted official policies and customs permitting the occurrence of the types of wrongs \nset forth herein above. These policies and customs include, but are not limited to, the \ndeliberately indifferent training of its employees in matters pertaining to strip searches \nand visual body cavity searches. \n  89.  Plaintiff, on information and belief, alleges that such errant policies and/or \ncustoms and practices of the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional \nServices  were  the  moving  force  behind  the  violation  of  Plaintiff’s  rights  and  the \nDefendants, each of them, are liable for all of the injuries sustained by Ms. Munyiri as \nset forth herein above. \n  90.  As a direct and proximate result of this conduct, Plaintiff has suffered \ninjuries including, but not limited to: assault, battery, false arrest, negligent infliction of \nemotional distress, mental anguish, embarrassment, invasion of privacy, violation of \nconstitutional rights, and deprivation of constitutional rights. \nCount II – 42 USC 1983 \nMunyiri v. Gary D. Maynard \n \n  91.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 90 of this Complaint \nas if more fully set forth herein. \n  92.  Defendant, Gary D. Maynard, is the Secretary of the Maryland Department \nof Public Safety and Correctional Services and is the policy maker for the agency and \nits constituent facilities, including the CBIF. \n  93.  Defendant Maynard implemented and maintained a policy and practice of \nconducting strip searches and visual body cavity searches of all persons who were \nadmitted to the CBIF, regardless of the nature of charges or the circumstances of the \nindividual. \n12 \n \n\n  94.  Defendant  Maynard  knew  or  should  have  known  that  the  strip  search \npolicy and practice at the CBIF, as implemented by its personnel, would directly result in \ncorrectional officers conducting unconstitutional searches of every man and woman who \nwas held in the jail, including Plaintiff. \n  95.  Because of his supervisory role, Defendant Maynard knew or should have \nknown that it was clearly established law that as of 1986, strip and cavity searches of \nthose arrested for offenses not likely to involve weapons or contraband, without any \nindividualized  finding  of  reasonable  suspicion,  were  constitutionally  impermissible.          \nSmith v. Montgomery County, 643 F. Supp. 435 (1986); Jones v. Murphy, 470 F. Supp. \n2d 537 (2007). \n  96.   The right to be free of such searches is clearly established in the law. \n  97.  Defendant Maynard established and enforced the policy and practice of \nconducting routine strip searches and body cavity searches, without legal authority or \nany reason to believe the men and women so searched had anything concealed on \ntheir persons. \n  98.  Defendant Maynard implemented and maintained this strip search policy \nand practice. \n  99.  As a result of Defendant Maynard's conduct, Plaintiff was subjected to the \nstrip search described above. \n  100.  Even  after  Defendant  Maynard  had  actual  notice  that  the  policy  and \npractice  of  strip-searching  women  and  men  was  unconstitutional,  he  continued  to \nenforce that unconstitutional policy and practice or otherwise failed to properly train \n13 \n \n\nthose under his supervision to ensure citizens do not suffer the constitutional violations \nsuch as those prompting this Complaint. \n  101.  Defendant Maynard acted with reckless indifference to the Constitutional \nRights of the men and women detained by the CBIF, including Plaintiff, and as such, \nwith malice. \n    102.  As a direct and proximate result of this conduct, Plaintiff has suffered \ninjuries including, but not limited to: assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional \ndistress,  negligent  infliction  of  emotional  distress,  mental  anguish,  embarrassment, \ninvasion of privacy, violation of constitutional rights, and deprivation of constitutional \nrights. \nCount III – 42 USC 1983 \nMunyiri v. Naomi Williams \n \n  103.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 102 of this Complaint \nas if more fully set forth herein. \n   104.  Defendant, Naomi Williams, is the acting Warden for the Baltimore Central \nIntake and Booking Facility and is, along with Defendant Gary Maynard, the policy \nmaker for the CBIF. \n  105.  Defendant Williams implemented and maintained a policy and practice of \nconducting strip searches and visual body cavity searches of all persons who were \nadmitted to the CBIF, regardless of the nature of charges or the circumstances of the \nindividual. \n  106.  Because of her supervisory role, Defendant Williams knew or should have \nknown that the strip search policy and practice at the CBIF, as implemented by its \n14 \n \n\npersonnel,  would  directly  result  in  correctional  officers  conducting  unconstitutional \nsearches of every man and woman who was held in the jail, including Plaintiff. \n  107.  Because or her supervisory role, Defendant Williams knew or should have \nknown that as of 1986, strip and cavity searches of those arrested for offenses not likely \nto  involve  weapons  or  contraband,  without  any  individualized  finding  of  reasonable \nsuspicion, were constitutionally impermissible.  Smith v. Montgomery County, 643 F. \nSupp. 435 (1986); Jones v. Murphy, 470 F. Supp. 2d 537 (2007). \n  108.  The right to be free of such searches is clearly established in the law. \n  109.  Defendant Williams established and enforced the policy and practice of \nconducting routine strip searches and body cavity searches, without legal authority or \nany reason to believe the men and women so searched had anything concealed on his \nor her person. \n  110.  Defendant Williams implemented and maintained this strip search policy \nand practice. \n            111.    As a result of Defendant Williams's conduct, Plaintiff was subjected to the \nstrip and cavity search described above. \n            112.    Even after Defendant Williams had actual notice that the policy and \npractice  of  strip  searching  women  and  men  was  unconstitutional,  she  continued  to \nenforce that unconstitutional policy and practice or otherwise failed to properly train \ncorrectional officers under her supervision to ensure citizens do not suffer constitutional \nviolations such as those prompting this Complaint. \n15 \n \n\n            113.    Defendant Williams acted with reckless indifference to the constitutional \nrights of the men and women detained by the CBIF, including Plaintiff, and as such, with \nmalice. \n            114.    As a direct and proximate result of this conduct, Plaintiff has suffered \ninjuries including, but not limited to: assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional \ndistress,  negligent  infliction  of  emotional  distress,  mental  anguish,  embarrassment, \ninvasion of privacy, violation of constitutional rights, and deprivation of constitutional \nrights. \nCount IV – 42 USC 1983 \nMunyiri v. John and Jane Doe \n  \n  115.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 114 of this Complaint \nas if more fully set forth herein. \n  116.  Defendants, John and Jane Doe, are correctional officers employed by the \nMaryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services. \n  117.  Defendants John and Jane Doe engaged in the practice of conducting \nstrip searches and visual body cavity searches of all persons who were admitted to the \nCBIF, regardless of the nature of charges or the circumstances of the individual. \n  118.  Defendants John and Jane Doe knew or should have known that the strip \nsearch policy and practice at the CBIF, and as performed by them upon Plaintiff, were \nunconstitutional.        \n  119.  Defendants John and Jane Doe knew or should have known that it was \nclearly established law that as of 1986, strip and cavity searches of those arrested for \noffenses not likely to involve weapons or contraband without any individualized finding \n16 \n \n\nof  reasonable  suspicion  were  constitutionally  impermissible.    Smith  v.  Montgomery \nCounty, 643 F. Supp. 435 (1986); Jones v. Murphy, 470 F. Supp. 2d 537 (2007). \n  120.  The right to be free of such searches is clearly established in the law. \n  121.  Defendants John and Jane Doe engaged in the practice of conducting \nroutine strip searches and body cavity searches, without legal authority or any reason to \nbelieve the men and women so searched had anything concealed on their persons. \n  122.  As a result of Defendants John and Jane Doe subjected Plaintiff to the \nstrip search described above. \n            123.    Defendants John and Jane Doe acted with reckless indifference to the \nconstitutional rights of the men and women detained by the CBIF, including Plaintiff, and \nas such, with malice. \n            124.    As a direct and proximate result of this conduct, Plaintiff has suffered \ninjuries including, but not limited to: assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional \ndistress,  negligent  infliction  of  emotional  distress,  mental  anguish,  embarrassment, \ninvasion of privacy, violation of constitutional rights, and deprivation of constitutional \nrights. \nCount V – 42 USC 1983 \nMunyiri v. Peter M. Haduch, Jr. \n  \n  125.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 124 of this Complaint \nas if fully set forth herein. \n  126.  Officer Haduch failed to properly communicate his intentions to block the \nMadison Street Ramp and failed to follow established police procedures in his attempt \nto do so. \n17 \n \n\n  127.  Officer  Haduch  knew  or  should  have  known  that  his  failure  to  do  so \ncreated an unreasonable risk of harm to himself, Plaintiff, and others, including the \npotential for false arrest, false imprisonment, and a concomitant deprivation of Plaintiff’s \ncivil liberties and constitutional rights. \n   128.  Plaintiff was unlawfully seized by Defendant Haduch without a warrant, \nprobable cause or reasonable suspicion of any wrongdoing whatsoever and assaulted \nher with two (2) deadly weapons, his patrol vehicle and his service weapon. \n  129.  Officer  Haduch  used  unreasonable  and  excessive  force  during  his \nunlawful arrest of Ms. Munyiri by attempting or preparing to attempt to ram Plaintiff’s \nvehicle with the Officer’s patrol car, by pointing his service weapon at Plaintiff without \nany  reasonable  justification,  and  by  forcing  her  to  lay  prone  in  the  roadway  of \nNorthbound I-83. \n  130.  In addition, and as a former “liaison officer” between the Baltimore City \nPolice Department and the CBIF, Officer Haduch, being intimately familiar with the \ninternal operations of that Facility, specifically knew the fate that awaited Ms. Munyiri \nwhen she arrived at the CBIF, to which Officer Haduch had entrusted her – that is to \nsay, a humiliating and unconstitutional strip and cavity search of her person.  \n  131.  The unconstitutional strip and cavity searching of arrestees charged with \nminor  offenses  is  a  pervasive,  well  documented  and  publicized  problem  within  the \nMaryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services in general and in the \nCBIF in particular and has been so for some time. \n  132.  Yet,  even  though  Plaintiff  was  charged  with  minor  traffic  offenses  by \nOfficer  Haduch  who  had  the  legal  discretion  not  to  arrest  Ms.  Munyiri,  Officer \n18 \n \n\nnonetheless  Haduch  transported  Ms.  Munyiri  to  the  CBIF,  thereby  exercising  his \ndiscretion  in  a  manner  which  virtually  guaranteed  the  constitutional  deprivations  of \nwhich Ms. Munyiri now complains. \n  133.  Officer  Haduch  acted  maliciously  and/or  was  guilty  of  a  wanton  and \nreckless disregard for the rights, feelings and safety of Plaintiff. \n  134.  As a direct and proximate result of this conduct, Plaintiff has suffered \ninjuries including, but not limited to: assault, battery, false arrest, false imprisonment, \nintentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress,  negligent  infliction  of  emotional  distress, \nmental anguish, embarrassment, invasion of privacy, violation of constitutional rights, \nand deprivation of constitutional rights. \nCount VI – 42 USC 1983 \nMunyiri v. Frederick H. Bealefeld, Baltimore City Police Department \nand \nThe Mayor and City Counsel of Baltimore \n \n  135.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 134 of this Complaint \nas if fully set forth herein. \n  136.  At all times relevant, Defendant Bealefeld was the acting Commissioner of \nthe Baltimore City Police Department, and was appointed to that post by the Mayor and \nCity Counsel of Baltimore. \n  137.  As such, he was ultimately responsible for directing the activities of the \nBaltimore  City  Police  Department  and  its  police  officers,  including  developing, \nimplementing, and maintaining training and other policies, including, but by no means \nlimited to, policies with regard to when and under what circumstances arrestees are to \nbe transported to the CBIF. \n19 \n \n\n  138.  At  all  times  relevant  defendants  Bealefeld,  the  Baltimore  City  Police \nDepartment, and the Mayor and City Counsel of Baltimore knew or should have known \nthat Baltimore City Police Officers are ill-trained in the appropriate methods for effecting \nroutine traffic stops, for blocking entrance ramps to freeways and similar activities which \ncan and do lead to unnecessary conflict between officers of the Baltimore City Police \nDepartment and the citizens of the State of Maryland as well as unnecessary, if not \nfalse imprisonment of, and the visitation of violence upon, otherwise innocent individuals \nby the Baltimore City Police Department. \n  139.  At  all  times  relevant,  defendants  Bealefeld,  the  Baltimore  City  Police \nDepartment, and the Mayor and City Counsel of Baltimore knew or should have known \nthat the unnecessary transportation of arrestees charged with minor traffic offenses not \ninvolving weapons, contraband, or a suspicion of either to the CBIF would result in an \nunconstitutional strip and cavity search of such arrestees, including Plaintiff. \n  140.  Despite this, the Baltimore City Police Department continues to transport \nand encourages, if not instructs, its officers to transport and entrust those charged with \nminor traffic offenses not involving weapons or contraband to the CBIF, even though the \nDepartment has been sued on multiple occasions for such conduct, is well aware of the \npractices of the CBIF through the appointment of “liaison officers” between it and the \nCBIF, and has been a codefendant with CBIF and its supervisory personnel for the \nvarious offenses set forth in this Complaint. \n  141.  As  such,  the  Baltimore  City  Police  Department  has  both  a  policy  of \ntransporting those charged with minor traffic violations to the CBIF when it otherwise \n20 \n \n\nhas a choice to merely instruct its officers to merely issue tickets and send drivers on \ntheir way with a promise to appear at any subsequent proceedings. \n  142.  The unconstitutional strip and cavity searching of arrestees charged with \nminor  offenses  is  a  pervasive,  well  documented  and  publicized  problem  within  the \nMaryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services in general and in the \nCBIF in particular and has been so for some time. \n  143.  Accordingly, defendants Bealefeld, the Baltimore City Police Department, \nand  the  Mayor  and  City  Counsel  of  Baltimore  possessed  actual  or  constructive \nknowledge that their subordinates were engaged in conduct that poses a pervasive and \nunreasonable risk of constitutional injury to the citizens of Maryland, and to Plaintiff in \nparticular. \n  144.  Defendants  Bealefeld,  the  Baltimore  City  Police  Department,  and  the \nMayor and City Counsel of Baltimore’s response to this knowledge was so inadequate \nas to constitute their respsective deliberate indifference to or their tacit authorization of \nthe aforementioned offensive and unconstitutional practices.  \n  145.    As a direct and proximate result of this conduct, Plaintiff has suffered \ninjuries including, but not limited to: assault, battery, false arrest, false imprisonment, \nintentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress,  negligent  infliction  of  emotional  distress, \nmental anguish, embarrassment, invasion of privacy, violation of constitutional rights, \nand deprivation of constitutional rights. \n  146.  There exists a causal and affirmative link between defendant’s failure to \nact and the constitutional injury of which Ms. Munyiri complains.  \n21 \n \n\n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Rosemary Munyiri, respectfully asks that this Court enter \njudgment in her favor and against the Defendants, both jointly and severally, on any or \nupon all of the Counts of this Complaint and as follows: \n            A.        Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00) in compensatory damages; \n            B.        Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00) in punitive damages; \n            C.        Reasonable attorneys fees; and \n            D.        For such other and further relief as the nature of this case may require. \nJury Trial Demand\n  Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 5(d) and 38, Plaintiff demands all issues in this matter \nbe tried before a jury. \n \n                Respectfully submitted: \n  \n                SCHULTE BOOTH, P.C.     \n                               \n                                                                                                                                                   \n              By:      /s/                  \n                Robert D.

MAYNARD, et al.,          : \nDefendants             : \n            ...o0o... \n \nMEMORANDUM \n  Now pending before the court is a motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint \nfor failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted filed by defendants Gary D. Maynard \n(“Secretary Maynard”), Secretary of the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional \nServices (“DPSCS”), Mitchell Franks (“former Warden Franks”), former Warden of the \nBaltimore Central Booking and Intake Facility (“CBIF”), and Naomi Williams (“Warden \nWilliams”), the CBIF’s current Warden (collectively “defendants”).  Plaintiffs Rosemary \nMunyiri, Kimberly Felder, Christina Schaeffer, and Nelear Walls are suing defendants in their \nindividual capacities under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of their Fourth and Fourteenth \nAmendment right to be free from unreasonable searches.  The issues in this case have been fully \nbriefed and no hearing is necessary.  For the reasons stated below, the defendants’ motion to \ndismiss will be denied. \n \nBACKGROUND \n  As this is a motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), the following facts are \npresented in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs. On July 28, 2008, Munyiri filed suit under \n§ 1983 against a number of defendants, including Secretary Maynard and Warden Williams, for \nthe strip and cavity search she was subjected to upon arrival at the CBIF after an arrest for traffic \n\nviolations.1 On November 2, 2008, Judge Davis denied Secretary Maynard and Warden \nWilliams’s motion to dismiss while granting the motion to dismiss of the Baltimore City Police \nDepartment (BCPD), BCPD Commissioner Bealefeld, and arresting officer Peter M. Haduch, Jr.2 \nThereafter, Munyiri sought and obtained defendants’ consent to amend the complaint to add \nadditional plaintiffs. Plaintiffs’ amended complaint now includes claims by Christina Schaeffer, \nKimberly Felder, and Nelear Walls against Secretary Maynard and Warden Williams and adds \nformer Warden Franks as an additional defendant. In addition, plaintiffs have increased the \namount of relief requested from five million dollars to twenty million dollars for both \ncompensatory damages and punitive damages. \n  The facts alleged by the new plaintiffs are as follows. Police officers brought Schaeffer to \nthe CBIF at approximately 4:30 a.m. on January 19, 2009, after arresting and charging her with \nsecond degree assault. Officers arrested Schaeffer in response to a domestic assault complaint \nand described the alleged victim as having minor scratches on his face and neck. Upon her \narrival at the CBIF, correctional officers ordered Schaeffer to disrobe and conducted a physical \nsearch of her hair and a visual search of her body cavities. She was also ordered to squat and \ncough while disrobed. After the search, officers placed Schaeffer in a holding cell and advised \nher that she would be placed in the general population until her bail was posted. Officers later \nmoved Schaeffer to a different part of the CBIF where a new set of correctional officers \nperformed a second strip and cavity search in the same manner as the first search. Schaeffer was \nreleased on bail approximately twenty-four hours later and the charges against her were \nsubsequently dismissed.  \n                                                           \n1 A more detailed account of Munyiri’s claims is provided in Judge Davis’ earlier memorandum \nopinion in this case, Munyiri v. Haduch, 585 F. Supp. 2d 670, 674 (D. Md. 2008). \n2 See id. at 679. \n2 \n \n\n  Police officers arrested Felder on or about April 12, 2008 following a physical altercation \nwith another woman in which no weapons or drugs were involved. After officers transported \nFelder to the CBIF, she informed the staff that she suffered from diabetes; staff members gave \nher medication, but denied her request for food. A correctional officer then brought Felder to a \nsmall room where she was instructed to disrobe. The officer conducted a visual search of \nFelder’s body cavities and patted Felder down while she was nude. Felder was also ordered to \nsquat and cough while disrobed. After being transported to two different holding cells, Felder \nwas eventually released on her own recognizance.  \n  On November 7, 2008 at approximately 4:00 p.m., a Baltimore City police officer \narrested Walls for failing to obey a stop sign as she exited her vehicle in front of her home. The \nofficer did not pat down Walls before transporting her to the CBIF. Once at the CBIF, police \nofficers and CBIF staff discussed whether they had the authority to detain Walls for minor traffic \ncitations. The arresting officer then added the charge of Fleeing or Attempting to Elude on Foot. \nCBIF correctional officers escorted Walls to a room, ordered her to disrobe, and conducted a \nphysical search of her hair and a visual search of her body cavities. Walls was also ordered to \nsquat and cough while disrobed. Walls was released on her own recognizance the following day \nat 4 a.m. and the State has placed all charges against her on the stet docket.  \nDefendants assert that this suit should be dismissed pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) \nbecause (1) former Warden Franks cannot be liable for acts that occurred after his retirement \nfrom the CBIF; (2) plaintiffs have failed to state a claim against defendants for supervisory \n3 \n \n\nliability; and (3) plaintiffs have improperly increased the amount of damages requested in their \namended complaint.3 I will address these issues in turn. \n \nANALYSIS \n \n \n“[T]he purpose of Rule 12(b)(6) is to test the sufficiency of a complaint and not to \nresolve contests surrounding the facts, the merits of a claim, or the applicability of defenses.”  \nPresley v. City of Charlottesville, 464 F.3d 480, 483 (4th Cir. 2006) (quoting Edwards v. City of \nGoldsboro, 178 F.3d 231, 243 (4th Cir. 1999) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). \nWhen ruling on such a motion, the court must “accept the well-pled allegations of the complaint \nas true,” and “construe the facts and reasonable inferences derived therefrom in the light most \nfavorable to the plaintiff.”  Ibarra v. United States, 120 F.3d 472, 474 (4th Cir.1997).  To survive \na motion to dismiss, the factual allegations of a complaint “must be enough to raise a right to \nrelief above the speculative level, . . . on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint \nare true (even if doubtful in fact).”  Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) \n(internal citations omitted).  Thus the plaintiff’s obligation is to set forth sufficiently the \n“grounds of his entitlement to relief,” offering more than “labels and conclusions.”  Id. (internal \n                                                           \n3 Defendants also argue that plaintiffs have failed to state claims against the State of Maryland, \nthe DPSCS, and former Warden Franks and Warden Williams in their official capacity. Plaintiffs \nhave already conceded, however, that they possess no valid claims against the State, and Ms. \nMunyiri voluntarily dismissed her claims against the DPSCS and her official capacity claim \nagainst Warden Williams at an October 27, 2008 hearing. See Munyiri, 585 F. Supp. 2d at 673; \nMem. Supp. Pls.’ Resp. Opp’n Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss 1st Am. Compl. at 3. The mere fact that \nformer Warden Franks has now been added to the complaint and the term “official capacity” \nappears in an introductory paragraph in plaintiffs’ amended complaint is insufficient to either \nrevive the official capacity claim against Warden Williams or introduce such a claim against \nformer Warden Franks. See 1st Am. Compl. at ¶ 18. Indeed Count II of the amended complaint, \nwhich contains the charges against former Warden Franks and Warden Williams, refers only to \nboth defendants’ “supervisory role,” rather than their “official capacity.” See id. at ¶¶ 145-56.  \n4 \n \n\nquotation and alterations omitted); see Young v. City of Mount Ranier, 238 F.3d 567, 577 (4th \nCir. 2001) (“the presence [in a complaint] . . . of a few conclusory legal terms does not insulate a \ncomplaint from dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) when the facts alleged in the complaint cannot \nsupport” the necessary legal finding). \n1.  Former Warden Franks’s Liability for Acts that Occurred After his Retirement \nPlaintiffs argue that former Warden Franks may be sued in his individual capacity for \nsupervisory liability under § 1983 despite the fact that he was no longer employed with the CBIF \nduring the dates of the alleged strip and cavity searches. Supervisory liability may attach under § \n1983 if a plaintiff can establish: \n(1) that the supervisor had actual or constructive knowledge that his subordinate was \nengaged in conduct that posed “a pervasive and unreasonable risk” of constitutional \ninjury  to  citizens  like  the  plaintiff;  (2)  that  the  supervisor's  response  to  that \nknowledge  was  so  inadequate  as  to  show  “deliberate  indifference  to  or  tacit \nauthorization  of  the  alleged  offensive  practices”;  and  (3)  that  there  was  an \n“affirmative  causal  link”  between  the  supervisor's  inaction  and  the  particular \nconstitutional injury suffered by the plaintiff. \n \nJones v. Murphy, 470 F.Supp. 2d 537, 545 (D. Md. 2007) (citing Shaw v. Stroud, 13 F.3d 791, \n799 (4th Cir. 1994)). The time gap between the date former Warden Franks left his position with \nthe CBIF and the dates of the plaintiffs’ alleged strip searches only presents an issue with regard \nto the third element dealing with causation. See Shaw, 13 F.3d at 800.  \nDefendants correctly note that the amended complaint fails to name former Warden \nFranks in the paragraph alleging a causal link between Warden Williams’s conduct and the \nsubsequent strip and cavity searches. See 1st Am. Compl. ¶ 153. Given the plaintiffs’ inclusion \nof former Warden Franks alongside Warden Williams in all other allegations in Count II of the \ncomplaint, however, this omission appears to be a good faith mistake on the part of plaintiffs’ \n5 \n \n\ncounsel rather than a true failure to allege.4 See id. at ¶¶ 146-49, 151-52, 154-55. Accordingly, I \ngrant plaintiffs leave to file a second amended complaint within 21 days to remedy this mistake.  \nAssuming plaintiffs had included a causal allegation against former Warden Franks, they \nwould have stated a valid claim against him. In Shaw, the defendant had left his supervisory role \nfifteen months before the date of the alleged constitutional violation. Id. Nevertheless, noting that \n“the causal link in § 1983 cases is analogous to proximate cause,” the court found that the \nconstitutional injury was “a natural and foreseeable consequence of” the defendant’s conduct and \nthus the supervisory liability claim against the defendant could survive the motion for summary \njudgment. Id. at 800-01. Similarly, plaintiffs in this case claim that former Warden Franks \nestablished and implemented a policy of routine strip and cavity searches and continued to \nenforce this policy even after receiving actual notice that the practice was unconstitutional. If \ntrue, these allegations could support a finding that the resulting unconstitutional strip and cavity \nsearches were a “natural and foreseeable consequence” of former Warden Franks’s conduct. \nThus the fact that former Warden Franks was no longer employed with the CBIF at the time the \nstrip searches occurred does not automatically defeat plaintiffs’ claims against him.  \n \n2.  Charges Based on Defendants’ Supervisory Liability \nDefendants repeat their arguments from their previous motion to dismiss that plaintiffs \nhave failed to state a claim against Secretary Maynard, former Warden Franks, and Warden \nWilliams for supervisory liability under § 1983. These arguments have already been addressed \n                                                           \n4 Indeed plaintiffs have likely implied causation. After including former Warden Franks’s name \nin all of the allegations describing conduct in Count II, plaintiffs conclude this section of the \ncomplaint by alleging that “[a]s a direct and proximate result of this conduct, Plaintiffs have \nsuffered injuries including…violation of constitutional rights, and deprivation of constitutional \nrights.” 1st Am. Compl. ¶ 156 (emphasis added).  \n6 \n \n\nand found unpersuasive in Judge Davis’s earlier opinion in this case. See Munyiri, 585 F. Supp. \n2d at 675. Although there are now additional plaintiffs, these plaintiffs’ claims are identical in \nsubstance to Ms. Munyiri’s original claims and thus state a claim upon which relief can be \ngranted.  \n \n3.  Increase in Amount of Requested Damages  \nDefendants argue that this court must limit the damages proposed by plaintiffs in their \namended complaint because they did not explicitly seek permission from defendants to amend \ntheir complaint for the purpose of increasing the amount of relief requested. Plaintiffs properly \nsought and obtained defendants’ permission to amend their complaint pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. \n15(a)(2) and Local Rule 103.6(d). Apparently the issue of damages was not discussed. The \ndefendants were informed of plaintiffs’ intention to add more plaintiffs to the case, however, and \nthus could have anticipated an accompanying increase in the demand for relief. In any event, \neven if damages should be limited, there is no basis to dismiss the complaint.  \n \nCONCLUSION \n \n  For the foregoing reasons, the defendants’ motions to dismiss will be denied.  A separate \nOrder follows.  \n \n \n     September 1, 2009                                   /s/                                  \nDate              Catherine C.

Maynard, Secretary of the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, \nand Mitchell Franks and Naomi Williams, former Wardens of the Baltimore Central Booking \nand Intake Center (“Central Booking”).  They have been sued by four female plaintiffs who \nallege they were subjected to unconstitutional strip searches in violation of the Fourth \nAmendment following their arrests for minor offenses.  Two of the plaintiffs were searched in \nApril 2008, during Warden Franks’s tenure.  The other two plaintiffs were searched in November \n2009 and January 2009, respectively, during Warden Williams’s tenure.  The plaintiffs bring \ntheir claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, relying on a theory of supervisory liability against the \nSecretary and the Wardens.1 \n  Under § 1983, supervisory liability may attach if a plaintiff can establish: \n(1) that the supervisor had actual or cons tructive knowledge that his subordi nate was \nengaged in conduct that  posed “a pervasive and unreasonable  risk” of constitutional \ninjury to citizens like the plaintiff; (2) that the supervisor’s response to that knowledge \nwas so inadequate as to  show “deliberate indifference to or tacit authorization of the  \nalleged offensive practices,”; and (3) that there was an “affirmative causal link” between \nthe supervisor’s inaction and the particular constitutional injury suffered by the plaintiff. \n \nShaw v. Stroud, 13 F.3d 791, 799 (4th Cir. 1994) (internal citations omitted).  \n                                                           \n1  There also is a claim against an individual correctional officer, who allegedly conducted one of the searches, but \nsummary judgment has not been requested on her behalf. \n\n  As to Wardens Franks and Williams, as the parties’ papers demonstrate, the facts relevant \nto their knowledge and to the ad equacy of their response are inex tricably intertwined with the \nrelated litigation still pending in this court:  Jones v. Murphy, Civil No. CCB-05-1287.  In that \ncase, extensive summary judgment briefing is underway but not ye t complete.  In the interests \nof both judicial economy and fully informed decision making, and because of the extent of the \nfactual disputes between the parties about the Wardens’ knowledge, it appears most sensible to \ndeny the motions filed on behalf of the wardens at  this time, without prejudice to renewal after \nresolution of the pending motions in Jones v. Murphy.  As to Secretary Maynard, however, the \nplaintiffs have not demonstrated more than, at  most, negligent supervision, rather than tacit \nauthorization or deliberate indifference in the face of a known unconstitutional practice.  He is \nnot a defendant in the Jones case, nor, apparently, was he informed of it until 2009; he oversees \nmultiple correctional facilities and a Department that employs approximately 11,000 people, \nand he was appointed from out-of-state in January 2007.  At least in this cas e, the plaintiffs do \nnot challenge the validity of the 2008 post orders, but rather th e correctional officers’ alleged \nfailure to follow them.  Even if Secretary Maynard should have known of the alleged violations, \nand “might have done more,” th is does not satisfy the standard  for supervisory liability.   See \nShaw, 13 F.3d at 801; see also Randall v. Prince George’s County, 302 F.3d 188, 206 (4th Cir. \n2002); cf. Slakan v. Porter, 737 F.2d 368, 374-75 (4th Cir. 1984).  Accordingly, the defendants’ \nmotion will be granted as to Secretary Maynard. \n  Finally, summary judgment will be gran ted as to any claim  plaintiff Schaeffer may be \nasserting about a second alleged search at the Women’s Detention Center, as the Center was not \nsupervised by Warden Franks or Warden Williams. \n2 \n \n\n  A separate Order follows. \n \nMarch 31, 2011                              /s/                                                               \nDate              Catherine C.

Bealefeld (hereinafter “Bealefeld”), and Officer Peter M. \nHaduch, Jr.(hereinafter “Haduch”), by and through their undersigned counsel and \npursuant to L. R. 105 and F. R. Civ. P 12(b)(6), hereby files this Memorandum of Law in \nsupport of their consolidated motion to dismiss.  In support of their consolidated motion, \nBPD, Bealefeld, and Haduch further state and aver the following:  \nStandard of Review \n  “A motion to dismiss pursuant to F. R. Civ. P.12 (b)(6) tests the sufficiency of [a] \ncomplaint.”  Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, 178 F.3d 231, 243 (4th Cir. 1999).  The \ndistrict court is not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual \nallegation.  See Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 286 (1986) (citing Briscoe v. LaHue, \n663 F.2d 713, 723 (7th Cir. 1981)); Young v. City of Mount Ranier, 238 F.3d 567, 577 \n(4th Cir. 2001); White v. Mortgage Dynamics, Inc., 528 F. Supp. 2d. 576, 578 (D. Md. \n\n2007).  The court is not obligated to accept Plaintiff's conclusory allegations regarding \nthe legal effect of the facts alleged.  See United Mine Workers of Am. v. Wellmore Coal \nCorp., 609 F.2d 1083, 1085-86 (4th Cir. 1994).   A Plaintiff has an obligation to provide \ngrounds for his entitlement to relief and that obligation requires more than labels, \nconclusions, and formalistic recitation of the elements of a cause of action.  See Bell Atl. \nCorp. v. Twombly, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 1969 (2007).  “Factual allegations must be enough to \nraise a right to relief above a speculative level.”  Qwest Communs. Corp. v. Maryland-\nNational Capital Park & Planning Commission, 553 F. Supp. 2d 572, 574 (D. Md. 2008) \n(quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 1965 (2007).)  “Once a claim has \nbeen stated adequately, it may be supported by showing any set of facts consistent with \nthe allegations in the complaint.”  Twombly, 127 S. Ct. at 1969 (2007).  Should a \ncomplaint set forth an adequate statement of facts, “the [c]ourt must consider all well-\npled allegations … in the light most favorable to the [P]laintiff.”  See Lambeth. v. Bd. of \nComm 'rs of Davidson County, 407 F.3d 266, 268 (4th Cir. 2005).  The BPD, Bealefeld, \nand Haduch contend that the Plaintiffs’ Complaint is insufficient to state a cause of action \nfor which relief may be granted.  The Plaintiffs’ Complaint must be dismissed. \nFacts  \n  On April 12, 2008 at approximately 7:35 p.m., the plaintiff, Rosemary Munyiri \n(hereinafter “Plaintiff”) was driving home from work.  Pl’s Compl. at ¶¶ 30-31.  \n“Unbeknownst to [Plaintiff], an accident had occurred some time prior [to her commute] \nin the area of I-83 and North Avenue.”  Id. at ¶ 35.  “As a result, a number of Baltimore \n[C]ity police officers were dispatched to block a number of entrance ramps to … I-83.”  \nId. at ¶ 36.  Haduch was one of several Baltimore Police officers dispatched to block an \n  2\n\nentrance ramp to I-83.  Id. at ¶ 37-38.  Initially, Haduch positioned his marked patrol \nvehicle across the Madison Street entrance ramp to I-83.  Id.  “Shortly thereafter, a \ncivilian vehicle attempted to bypass Haduch….”  Id. at ¶ 39.  Haduch was able to turn the \ncivilian vehicle away without incident.  Id. at ¶ 41.  “Thereafter, Officer Haduch \nrepositioned his patrol car from the entrance ramp onto the wide low curb immediately \nadjacent to [the Madison Street ramp to I-83 North] with his emergency lights activated \n….”  Id. at ¶ 42.  Haduch placed five road flares across the Madison Street ramp Id. at ¶ \n43.  “Approximately [twenty-five] minutes after Officer Haduch … placed road flares \nacross the Madison Street [r]amp, [Plaintiff] approached from the East … [and] \nproceeded up the [r]amp in the normal course as it was not blocked by Officer Haduch’s \n[p]atrol [v]ehicle or by any other physical barrier.”  Id. at ¶¶ 44-45.  “Plaintiff observed \nno road flares across the Madison Street [r]amp.”  Id. at ¶ 46.  Thereafter, Haduch \nproceeded after Plaintiff with lights and sirens activated.  Id. at ¶ 47.  Upon realizing that \nHaduch was attempting to stop her, Plaintiff stopped her vehicle after traveling four \ntenths of a mile up the I-83 ramp.  Id. at ¶¶ 49-50.  Once the Plaintiff’s vehicle was \nstopped, Haduch drew his service weapon for officer safety and ordered the Plaintiff to \nexit her vehicle. Id. at ¶¶ 53-58.  At gun point, Haduch ordered the Plaintiff to lie prone \non the wet ground.  Id.  Upon complying with Haduch’s order, Haduch arrested the \nPlaintiff for negligent driving, failure of driver to curb upon signal by police, and attempt \nby driver to elude uniformed police.  Id. at ¶ 71.  Haduch transported Plaintiff to the \nCentral Booking and Intake Facility (hereinafter “CBIF”) where prison officials subjected \nPlaintiff to a strip search.  Id. at ¶ 76.  On July 2, 2008, the state of Maryland entered a \nnolle prosequi to all charges against the Plaintiff because Haduch failed to appear for \n  3\n\ncourt.  Id. at ¶ 84.  The Plaintiff now brings the instant lawsuit against the BPD, \nBealefeld, and Haduch.         \nArgument \n  The 42 U.S.C. § 1983 cause of action asserted against the BPD, Bealefeld, and \nHaduch fail as a matter of law.1  Accordingly, the Plaintiffs Complaint must be dismissed \nagainst the aforementioned defendants. \nA.  Complaint against the BPD must be dismissed \n  The BPD is an agency of the State of Maryland.  PUBLIC LOCAL LAWS OF \nMARYLAND, Art. 4, § 16-2(a) (“The Police Department of Baltimore City is hereby \nconstituted and established as an agency and instrumentality of the State of Maryland.”); \nClea v. Baltimore, 312 Md. 662, 668 (1988) (“Unlike other municipal or county police \ndepartments which are agencies of the municipality or county, the Baltimore City Police \nDepartment is a state agency.”) (citations omitted); Ashton v. Brown, 339 Md. 70, 104 \nn.18 (1995) (“The Baltimore City Police Department, for purposes of Maryland law, is a \nstate agency.”); Baltimore Police Department v. Cherkes, 140 Md. App. 282, 303-05, 323 \n(2001); Williams v. Baltimore, 128 Md. App. 1 (1999), rev’d on other grounds, 359 Md. \n101 (2000).  The status of the BPD as a state agency dates back nearly 150 years.  \nBaltimore v. State, 15 Md. 376 (1860); H. H. Walker Lewis, The Baltimore Police Case \nof 1860, 26 MD. L. REV. 215 (1966).  The General Assembly continues to classify and \ntreat the BPD as a State agency to this day.  Clea, 312 Md. at 669; Adams v. Baltimore \n                                                 \n1 Count V and Count VI are the only counts asserted against the BPD, Bealefeld, and Haduch.  When \nreading the specific counts, it is unclear whether the Plaintiff attempts to assert federal and state causes of \nactions.  On the other hand, footnote number one on page five of the Plaintiff’s Complaint seems to \nindicate that she is only asserting an action against the BPD, Bealefeld, and Haduch under 42 U.S.C. § \n1983.  Hence, the BPD, Bealefeld, and Haduch will take the Plaintiff at her word and only address her \ncause of action as if she only presented a case under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  No state causes of action referenced \nin the specific counts will be addressed. \n  4\n\nTransit Co., 203 Md. 295, 311 (1953); Upshur v. Baltimore, 94 Md. 743, 756 (1902).  \nHence, as a matter of law, the BPD is entitled to immunity from civil suit guaranteed \nunder the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution.  See Dixon v. Balt. \nCity Police Dep't, 345 F. Supp. 2d 512, 513 (D. Md. 2003).  Moreover, as an \ninstrumentality and arm of the State of Maryland, the BPD is not considered a person for \nthe purposes of § 1983.  See Will v. Mich. Dep't of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71 (1989) \n(A State nor its officials acting in their official capacities are \"persons\" under § 1983.)  \nThe Plaintiff’s Complaint against the BPD must be dismissed.   \n  Notwithstanding the BPD’s position, the BPD is aware that in Hector v. Weglin, \nChief Judge Kaufman, writing for this federal district, did not agree with the BPD’s \nEleventh Amendment argument pertaining to § 1983 lawsuits.  See Hector v. Weglin, 558 \nF. Supp. 194 (D. Md. 1982).2  Judge Kaufman opined that the record before him \ndemonstrated that the Mayor & City Council of Baltimore (hereinafter “MCC”) had \nenough influence over the BPD as to make the BPD an arm of the MCC for the purposes \nof § 1983.  Id. at 198.  Later, Chief Judge Legg, writing for this federal district agreed \nwith the analysis of Hector.  See Alderman v. Baltimore City Police Dep't, 952 F. Supp. 256, \n258 (D. Md. 1997).  Unfortunately, Chief Judges Kaufman and Legg did not have the \nbenefit of recent case law which has affirmed the BPD’s status as a state agency and has \nemphasized the MCC’s lack of control over the affairs of the BPD.  See Clark v. \nO'Malley, 169 Md. App. 408, 431 (2006) (The Baltimore City Police Department is a \nState agency governed by the enactments of the General Assembly.  The Mayor enjoys \n                                                 \n2 Chief Judge Kaufman opined “[w]hile the Department and the Commissioner are hybrid creatures, the \nCity exercises such substantial control over the day-to-day activities and policies of the Department that if \nthere was something major amiss in the Department … the City and/or the Commissioner either would or \nshould have known about it, and would or should have taken steps toward cure of the same.” \n \n  5\n\nno inherent authority over the department or the office of Police Commissioner.) aff’d by \nMayor & City Council v. Clark, 404 Md. 13, 24 (2008) ([T]he General Assembly of \nMaryland was intent upon taking the City of Baltimore out of the business of controlling \ncivil disorders … [p]ursuant to Acts of 1860, ch. 7, the Baltimore Police Department was \nremoved completely from the control of the city government….); See also Dixon v. Balt. \nCity Police Dep't, 345 F. Supp. 2d 512, 513 (D. Md. 2003).  Hence, as a matter of law, \nthe BPD is a state agency which is not subject to control by the MCC.  Clark makes clear \nthat while the MCC can appoint and confirm a police commissioner, the MCC cannot \nsummarily fire a police commissioner if there are disagreements between the MCC and \nBPD.   Clark v. O'Malley, 169 Md. App. 408, 431 (2006) aff’d by Mayor & City Council \nv. Clark, 404 Md. 13, 24 (2008).  Accordingly, there is no control over the policies and \nprocedures of the BPD by the MCC.  The BPD is entitled to Eleventh Amendment \nimmunity from all civil suits.  The BPD, as an arm and instrumentality of the state of \nMaryland, is not a person for the purposes of § 1983. \n  However, should this Honorable Court follow the holdings in Hector and \nAlderman, the BPD is still entitled to a dismissal of the Plaintiff’s Complaint.  In the \ninstant matter, the Plaintiff seems to assert that the BPD has committed a constitutional \nviolation because it has an improper policy of having its officers’ transport people \narrested for misdemeanors to CBIF.  Pl’s Compl. at ¶ 140.  The Plaintiff alleges in a \nconclusory fashion that the BPD is aware that all people charged with misdemeanors will \nbe subjected to strip searches by CBIF personnel.  Id. at ¶¶ 139-146.  The BPD contends \nthat the Plaintiff’s Complaint assumes too much.   \n  6\n\nAs an initial matter, “[a] municipality is only liable under [§ 1983] if it causes \nsuch a deprivation through an official policy or custom.”  Carter v. Morris, 164 F. 3d 215, \n218 (4th Cir. 1999).  Here, the Plaintiff points to no facts in her Complaint which \nsuggests that the BPD or any of its agents and employees perform strip searches at CBIF.  \nAdditionally, the Plaintiff has not pointed to a policy, procedure, and/or custom of the \nBPD whereby it encourages strip searches of its misdemeanor arrestees upon entering \nCBIF.  This federal district has had the occasion to deal with claims such as the \nPlaintiff’s recently.   In Jones v. Murphy, the court found that cases such as the Plaintiff’s \nattempt to assert an “entrustment liability” cause of action.  Jones v. Murphy, 470 F. \nSupp. 2d 537, 552 (D. Md. 2007).  The court found that “[a]n \"entrustment liability\" \napproach, [which obviously the Plaintiff here attempts to assert], has been neither \nadopted nor rejected in the Fourth Circuit.” Id. at 552. “Liability …requires that the \naccused municipality have both a policy of entrustment and knowledge of constitutional \nviolations at the detaining entity.”  Id. at 553.  However, “[i]mplicit in the policy \ncomponent required to impose liability is that the entrusting entity has formulated the \npolicy; that is, that it had a choice over whether to follow the challenged course of \naction.”  Id.  Here, the Plaintiff has not pled one fact which suggests that the BPD was \naware that CBIF allegedly has a policy of strip searching all misdemeanor arrestees, as \nopposed to classifying arrestees based on offenses.  In a conclusory fashion, the Plaintiff \nstates, without any facts, that the BPD has actual or constructive knowledge of CBIF’s \nalleged behavior because strip searches at CBIF is “well documented”.  Pl’s Compl at ¶ \n142.  Moreover, as the City defendants asserted in Jones, the BPD cannot be held liable \nfor strip searches at CBIF because its employees have no choice but to present all if its \n  7\n\narrestees to CBIF for processing.  See Jones v. Murphy, 470 F. Supp. 2d 537, 553 (D. \nMd. 2007).  Hence, the BPD and its employees, as a matter of Maryland law, must \npresent its arrestees to CBIF for charging and processing.  The BPD has no choice in the \nmatter.  Accordingly, the Plaintiff’s Complaint against the BPD must be dismissed.             \nB.  Complaint against Bealefeld must be dismissed \n  Likewise, and for the same reasons asserted above, the Plaintiff’s Complaint must \nbe dismissed against the Bealefeld.   “In order for supervisory inaction to form the basis \nof § 1983 liability, it is necessary that the supervisor have actual or fairly imputable \nknowledge of the misconduct.”  Hector v. Weglin, 558 F. Supp. 194, 201 (D. Md. 1982).  \n“[A] supervisor [must] have knowledge (actual or constructive) of his subordinate \nbehaving in a way that posed a pervasive and unreasonable risk of constitutional injury.”  \nJones v. Murphy, 470 F. Supp. 2d 537, 546 (D. Md. 2007)  Here, the Plaintiff has pled no \nfacts which suggests that Bealefeld knew or should have known that CBIF allegedly strip \nsearches all misdemeanor arrestees brought to its facility.  Thus, the Plaintiffs have failed \nto plead a cause of action against Bealefeld.  \n  Moreover, even if a cause of action could be pled against Bealefeld in the instant \nmatter, he would nevertheless have qualified immunity.  “Qualified immunity is a \ndoctrine that shields government officials performing discretionary functions from \nliability for civil damages when their conduct does not violate clearly established \nstatutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.” \nRossignol v. Voorhaar, 321 F. Supp. 2d 642, 646 (D. Md. 2004) quoting Harlow v. \nFitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982).  “Generally, when the doctrine of qualified \nimmunity is raised as a defense, the Court must first identify the right infringed by the \n  8\n\nchallenged conduct.”  Id.  “The Court then considers whether, at the time of the violation, \nthe right was clearly established, and whether a reasonable person in the official's \nposition would have known that his conduct would violate that right.”  Id.  In the instant \nmatter, Bealefeld could not have known that entrusting misdemeanor arrestees to CBIF \nwould subject him to liability.  As the court in Jones v. Murphy discussed, the Fourth \nCircuit has not opined on “entrustment liability” as pled by the Plaintiff.  See Jones v. \nMurphy, 470 F. Supp. 2d 537, 553 (D. Md. 2007).  Only one case in this federal district \nappears to have dealt with the Plaintiff’s cause of action and that case, Jones, dismissed \nthe City and its agencies and employees from the lawsuit.  Id.  Hence, a reasonable \nperson in Bealefeld’s position would not have known that entrustment of misdemeanor \narrestees would violate clearly established constitutional rights.  The Complaint against \nBealefeld must be dismissed.            \nC.  Complaint against Haduch must be dismissed \n  In Count V of the Plaintiff’s Complaint, the Plaintiff asserts that Haduch arrested \nher without probable cause and assaulted and used excessive force when he pointed his \nservice weapon at her and used his patrol vehicle to maneuver the Plaintiff’s vehicle to \nthe side of the road.  Pl’s Compl at ¶¶ 126-129.   “[A]n arrest without probable cause \ncreates a cause of action under § 1983; however, … the existence of probable cause \nconstitutes a bar to such a claim. See Street v. Surdyka, 492 F.2d 368, 372-73 (4th Cir. \n1974).  In the instant matter, Haduch contends that the facts, as pled by the Plaintiff, \ndemonstrates that he had probable cause to arrest the Plaintiff.  The Plaintiff admits in her \npleadings that Haduch attempted to block the Madison Street ramp to I-83.  Further, the \nPlaintiff admits that she entered the Madison Street ramp, albeit she claims that she did \n  9\n\nnot observe the road flares that Haduch placed on the road.  Hence, the Plaintiff \naffirmatively admits in her pleadings to committing the traffic violations to which she \nwas charged.  The Plaintiff’s § 1983 cause of action fails because the Haduch had \nprobable cause to arrest the Plaintiff for a misdemeanor committed in his presence.   \n  Next, the Plaintiff asserts that Haduch used excessive force by pointing his \nservice weapon at her and using his patrol vehicle to force her to the side of the road.  \nNotably however, the Plaintiff’s Complaint never asserts that Haduch ever stuck the \nPlaintiff with his service weapon or vehicle.   \nClaims of excessive force during an arrest or investigatory \nstop are examined under the Fourth Amendment's objective \nreasonableness standard. See Graham v. Connor, 490 U. S. \n386, 395, 109 S. Ct. 1865, 104 L. Ed. 2d 443 (1989). This \n\"requires balancing the nature and quality of the intrusion \non the individual's Fourth Amendment interests against the \nimportance of the governmental interests alleged to justify \nthe intrusion.\" Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U. S. 1, 8, 105 S. \nCt. 1694, 85 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1985) (citation omitted). Factors \nto be included in making this determination include the \nseverity of the crime, whether there is an immediate threat \nto the safety of the officer or others, and whether the \nsubject is resisting arrest or attempting to flee. Graham, \n490 U. S. at 396. The determination is to be made \"from the \nperspective of a reasonable officer on the scene.\" Id. \"The \nConstitution simply does not require police to gamble with \ntheir lives in the face of a serious threat of harm.\" Elliott v. \nLeavitt, 99 F.3d 640, 641 (4th Cir. 1996), reh'g en banc \ndenied, 105 F.3d 174 (4th Cir. 1997). \"The right to make an \narrest carries with it the right to use the amount of force \nthat a reasonable officer would think necessary to take the \nperson being arrested into custody.\" Martin v. Gentile, 849 \nF.2d 863, 869 (4th Cir. 1988). \n \nLawrence v. Montgomery County, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95964 aff’d by  Lawrence v. \nMontgomery County, 222 Fed. Appx. 272, 2007 (4th Cir. 2007).  In the instant matter, \n  10\n\nHaduch used reasonable force to arrest the Plaintiff.  The Plaintiff’s Complaint must be \ndismissed against Haduch. \nConclusion \nFor the reasons advanced above, defendants BPD, Bealefeld, and Haduch \nrespectfully move this Honorable Court to dismiss the Plaintiff’s Complaint against them \nwith prejudice. \n          Respectfully submitted, \n            _________/S/______________   \n            Neal M.

Plaintiff Rosemary Munyiri asserts that she was pulled over\nfor minor traffic offenses, arrested at gunpoint, and taken to the Baltimore Central Booking\nand Intake Facility (“CBIF”), where she was subjected to strip and visual body cavity\nsearches. Munyiri has filed a multitude of damages claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for\nviolation  of  the  Fourth  Amendment  against  the  following  defendants:  (1)  Maryland\nDepartment of Public Safety and Correctional Services (“DPSCS”); (2) the Secretary of\nDPSCS (“Secretary Maynard”); (3) the Warden of the Central Booking and Intake Facility\n(“Warden Williams”);(4) Unnamed correctional officers at CBIF; (5) the Baltimore City\nPolice Department (“the BCPD”); (6) the Commissioner of the BCPD (“Commissioner\nBealefeld”); (7) the arresting officer, Peter M. Haduch, Jr. (“Officer Haduch”); and (8) the\nMayor  and  City  Council  of  Baltimore  City.  Secretary  Maynard,  Warden  Williams,\nCommissioner Bealefeld, and Officer Haduch were sued in both their official and individual\ncapacities.\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01953-CCB   Document 18   Filed 11/02/08   Page 2 of 12\nAll defendants filed motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to\nFed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). The court held a hearing on October 27, 2008. At the hearing, plaintiff\nvoluntarily dismissed her claims against the DPSCS, the official capacity claims against\nSecretary Maynard and Warden Williams, and the claims against the Mayor and City Council\nof Baltimore City. For the reasons set forth within, I shall deny the motions filed by Secretary\nMaynard and Warden Williams and grant in their entirety the remaining motions. \nI.\n   As this is a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the facts alleged in the complaint\nare assumed to be true. The following facts are alleged by plaintiff.1\nMunyiri is a Registered Nurse who works at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. On April\n12, 2008, she left the hospital at approximately 7:35 p. m. and began her commute home on\na rainy and cloudy evening. Unbeknownst to Munyiri, an accident had occurred on I-83\nNorth and Baltimore City police officers had blocked some of the northbound entrance\nramps. Officer Haduch was positioned at the Madison Street ramp, which he had barricaded\nusing his patrol vehicle and several road flares. Despite Haduch’s apparent efforts to block\n1The summary of plaintiff’s allegations set forth above is supplemented with additional\nfacts taken from the sworn statement of charges filed in state court by the arresting officer,\ndefendant Haduch. Plaintiff quoted liberally from the statement of charges in her complaint but\nshe did not attach a copy of the statement of charges to her complaint. At my request, plaintiff\nprovided a copy of the statement of charges after the hearing. See, e.g., Phillips v. LCI Int’l, Inc.,\n190 F.3d 609, 618 (4th Cir.1999)(noting that “a court may consider [a document not attached to\nthe complaint] in determining whether to dismiss the complaint [where the document] was\nintegral to and explicitly relied on in the complaint and [where] the plaintiffs do not challenge\n[the document’s] authenticity”)(alterations added).\n-2-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01953-CCB   Document 18   Filed 11/02/08   Page 3 of 12\nthe entrance ramp, Munyiri entered the ramp by driving  past or over the road flares that had\nbeen deployed by Officer Haduch.\nOfficer Haduch proceeded after plaintiff and “chased” her for approximately four-\ntenths of a mile before plaintiff pulled over her vehicle. It is evident from Officer Haduch’s\nstatement of charges that he believed he was dealing with a potentially dangerous individual\nand that he believed that plaintiff was purposely evading his attempts to effect a traffic stop.\nIn any event, upon stopping her, Haduch exited his police car, drew his service weapon, and\napproached Munyiri’s car. He shouted repeatedly for Munyiri to turn off her vehicle before\nshe complied. Similarly, he ordered her to throw her keys from the vehicle three times before\nshe complied. Haduch then ordered plaintiff to exit her vehicle and go to the ground,\nwhereupon he handcuffed her. Munyiri’s car, person and purse were searched.  \nHaduch charged Munyiri with three misdemeanor traffic offenses: (1) negligent\ndriving; (2) failure of driver to “curb” upon signal by police vehicle; and (3) attempt by\ndriver to elude uniformed police by failing to stop.\nHaduch transported Munyiri to CBIF, as are all persons arrested in Baltimore City.\nUpon plaintiff’s arrival, a nurse took her vital signs and informed her that she would be strip\nsearched. Officers at CBIF ordered plaintiff to disrobe and conducted a physical search of\nher hair and a visual search of her body cavities.  She was also ordered to squat and cough\nwhile disrobed. After the search, Munyiri was put in a holding cell, where she waited for\ntwenty-four hours before being released on bail.    \n-3-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01953-CCB   Document 18   Filed 11/02/08   Page 4 of 12\nAt trial on July 2, 2008, Haduch failed to appear and the state entered a nolle prosequi\nas to all the charges against Munyiri. Munyiri filed this action about three weeks later.  \nII.\nIn Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (2007), the Supreme Court\njettisoned its longstanding approach to motions to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\n12(b)(6), i.e., the “no set of facts” standard first articulated by the Court in Conley v. Gibson,\n355 U.S. 41 (1957).  The Court adopted a less generous approach by which to judge a\ncomplaint's sufficiency: whether the plaintiff stated “enough facts to state a claim to relief\nthat is plausible on its face.” Id. at 1974. The Court noted that “a plaintiff's obligation to\nprovide the grounds of his entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions,\nand a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.” Id. at 1964-65\n(internal quotations omitted).  \nIII.\nA \nPlaintiff alleges that Secretary Maynard and Warden Williams violated her Fourth and\nFourteenth Amendment right to be free of an unreasonable search by implementing and\nmaintaining a policy and practice of conducting strip searches and visual body cavity\nsearches of all persons admitted to the CBIF, regardless of the charges filed against, or the\ncircumstances surrounding the arrest of, the individual. Specifically, plaintiff asserts a claim\nof supervisory liability against Maynard and Williams in their individual capacity.  \nSupervisory liability may attach under § 1983 if a plaintiff can establish: \n-4-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01953-CCB   Document 18   Filed 11/02/08   Page 5 of 12\n(1)  that  the  supervisor  had  actual  or  constructive  knowledge  that  his\nsubordinate was engaged in conduct that posed “a pervasive and unreasonable\nrisk”  of  constitutional  injury  to  citizens  like  the  plaintiff;  (2)  that  the\nsupervisor’s  response  to  that  knowledge  was  so  inadequate  as  to  show\n“deliberate  indifference  to  or  tactic  authorization  of  the  alleged  offense\npractices”; and (3) that there was an “affirmative causal link” between the\nsupervisor’s inaction and the particular constitutional injury suffered by the\nplaintiff.  \nJones v. Murphy, 470 F. Supp. 2d 537, 545 (D. Md. 2007) (citing Shaw v. Stroud, 13 F.3d\n791, 799 (4th Cir. 1994)). In Jones, Judge Blake fully considered claims by a putative class\nof persons arrested in Baltimore City who were treated, or were threatened with treatment,\nessentially  identical  to  that  allegedly  suffered  by  plaintiff  here.  Indeed,  the  parties\nacknowledged at the hearing in this case that plaintiff would be a member of the putative\nclass  in  the  litigation  pending  before  Judge  Blake  in  Jones.  Plaintiff  has  basically\nincorporated by reference the allegations in Jones and thus, together with the specifics of\nher arrest and detention, has adequately plead the minimum facts necessary to state a claim\nof supervisory liability for a Fourth Amendment violation. \nSecretary Maynard and Warden Williams assert their right to qualified immunity.\nIn assessing a claim of qualified immunity, the court employs a two-pronged analysis.\nSaucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201-02 (2001). “[T]he court must first determine if the\npleaded facts demonstrate that the defendant's conduct violated a constitutional right.”\nBlankenship v. Manchin, 471 F.3d 523, 528 (4th Cir. 2006).  If a constitutional violation has\noccurred, the second step requires the court to consider whether the right was clearly\nestablished, measured by whether a reasonable officer would have believed the conduct to\nbe lawful under the same or similar circumstances. Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201-02. Thus, where\n-5-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01953-CCB   Document 18   Filed 11/02/08   Page 6 of 12\nan officer has invoked qualified immunity and relies on it in a dispositive motion, the court\nmust be persuaded: (1) that the officer actually committed a constitutional violation, and (2)\nthat the defendant’s conduct was objectively unreasonable under well-settled law.  Henry\nv. Purnell, 501 F.3d 374, 379-82 (4th Cir. 2007). For the reasons stated by Judge Blake in\nJones, qualified immunity does not, as a matter of law at this early stage of the case,\nforeclose plaintiff’s claim here. Jones, 470 F. Supp. 2d at 547 (citing Amaechi v. West, 237\nF.3d 356, 362-65 (4th Cir. 2001) (finding a strip search unconstitutional for an individual\narrested for a misdemeanor noise violation); Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007, 1013-14 (4th\nCir. 1981) (finding a strip search unreasonable when done to an arrestee whose offense was\nnot likely to involve weapons or contraband)).  \nB \nPlaintiff  seemingly  asserts  a  veritable  smorgasbord  of  §  1983  claims  against\ndefendants Officer Haduch, Commissioner Bealefeld and BCPD (referred to herein as\n“police defendants”), but distilled to their essence, the claims are Fourth Amendment\nunreasonable seizure claims.2  In their consolidated motion to dismiss, the police defendants\nassert that the BCPD is a state agency, and that therefore, the agency and, as to the official\ncapacity claims, Commissioner Bealefeld and Officer Haduch, are entitled to immunity\nunder the Eleventh Amendment. \n2In the circumstances here, to the extent that plaintiff alleges that any defendant was\nnegligent, e.g., that Officer Haduch negligently established the barricade at the entrance ramp to\nthe highway, such claims are not cognizable under § 1983. Cf. Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S.\n327, 330 (1986)(“[I]n any given § 1983  suit, the plaintiff must . . . prove a violation of the\nunderlying constitutional right; and depending on the right, merely negligent conduct may not be\nenough to state a claim.”).\n-6-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01953-CCB   Document 18   Filed 11/02/08   Page 7 of 12\nOf course, it is well-settled that a state agency (or agency official sued in her official\ncapacity) does not qualify as a “person” amenable to suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Will v.\nMichigan Dept. Of State Police, 491 U.S. 58 (1989). The issue here is whether the BCPD\nis a state agency for Eleventh Amendment purposes.3 Members of this court have found that\nit is not. Chin v. City of Baltimore, 241 F. Supp. 2d 546, 548 (D. Md. 2003) (“[t]he court\ndetermines that the Baltimore Police Department is not entitled to Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity. As a result, the Baltimore Police Department is a “person” subject to suit under\n§ 1983.”); Hector v. Weglin, 558 F. Supp. 194 (D. Md. 1982) (Kaufman, J.) (finding that the\nBCPD liable for suit under § 1983), and I agree with those determinations. Thus, the police\ndefendants are fully subject to suit under § 1983. Nevertheless, for the reasons stated below,\nplaintiff has failed to state a claim against those defendants.  \nPlaintiff alleges against Office Haduch a Fourth Amendment unreasonable seizure\nclaim based on the traffic stop and her arrest, and a Fourth Amendment excessive force\nclaim based on the manner of the stop and arrest. Haduch asserts that, as a matter of law, he\nhad reasonable articulable suspicion to make the traffic stop, probable cause to effect the\ncustodial arrest of plaintiff, and that he did not employ excessive force in effecting the stop\nand the arrest. I agree. \n3Defendants argue vigorously that the BCPD is a state agency and cites several state\ncourt opinions to that effect. E.g., Clark v. O’Malley, 169 Md. App. 408, 431 (2006), aff’d by\nMayor & City Council v. Clark, 404 Md. 12, 24 (2008). But this assertion misses the point. The\nissue not whether the BCPD is an agency of the state, but instead, whether it is the type of\nagency that is entitled to the benefit of Eleventh Amendment immunity.\n-7-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01953-CCB   Document 18   Filed 11/02/08   Page 8 of 12\nFirst, there plainly was reasonable articulable suspicion justifying Haduch’s decision\nto stop plaintiff.  Reasonable suspicion is “a particularized and objective basis for suspecting\nthe person stopped of criminal activity.” Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690, 696 (1996).\nHere, Haduch was blocking the Madison street ramp to I-83 North to protect the scene of\nan accident on the highway. Plaintiff acknowledges that she drove past five road flares and\na police car with its emergency lights flashing and drove onto the highway. Since plaintiff\ndid not stop on the ramp despite the police car and flares (as any reasonable motorist would\nbehave), as a matter of law, Officer Haduch had sufficient facts to constitute reasonable\nsuspicion to pull her over to investigate why she would do such a thing.4\nFurthermore, once plaintiff acceded to Haduch’s repeated efforts to stop her vehicle\nand pulled to the side of the highway, a reasonable officer could reasonably have concluded\nthat he had probable cause to arrest plaintiff. Probable cause to arrest “is a practical,\nnontechnical conception that deals with the factual and practical considerations of everyday\nlife on which reasonable and prudent men . . .act.” Maryland v. Pringle, 540 U.S. 366, 370\n(2003). Here, Haduch witnessed her commit three alleged misdemeanor driving offenses:\nnegligent driving, failure of driver to curb upon signal by police vehicle, and attempt by\ndriver to elude uninformed police by failing to stop. Indeed, plaintiff concedes that she did\nnot immediately pull over when requested, although she alleges she pulled over as soon as\n4As I speculated during the hearing, whether plaintiff was simply tired from a long shift\nat the hospital, inattentive to the perhaps less-than-perfect blockade of the ramp, or distracted by\nthe misty climatic conditions, Haduch clearly acted reasonably in pursuing her to determine why\nshe had simply driven past his barricade. It would have been irresponsible for an officer to have\ndone anything but pursue her.  \n-8-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01953-CCB   Document 18   Filed 11/02/08   Page 9 of 12\nit was, in her judgment, safe to do so. Since Haduch witnessed Munyiri commit these\nalleged misdemeanor offenses, he had probable cause to arrest her without a warrant.5     \nNor did Haduch use excessive force in arresting Munyiri. In the Fourth Circuit, the\nright to make an arrest “carries with it the right to use the amount of force that a reasonable\nofficer would think necessary.” Martin v. Gentile, 849 F.2d 863, 869 (4th Cir.1988). Claims\nof a de minimis injury, such as too-tight handcuffs, are insufficient. Norman v. Taylor, 25\nF.3d 1259, 1263 (4th Cir. 1994) (en banc); Carter v. Morris, 164 F.3d 215, 219 n.3 (4th Cir.\n1999).  Here, plaintiff alleges that Officer Haduch attempted to ram her car with his squad\ncar, that he pointed his service weapon at her, and that he forced her to lie prone in the\nhighway. However, plaintiff does not allege that Haduch contacted her car; nor does she\nallege that he shot her or even touched her with his gun. The sum of her complaint is that\nshe had to lie down on the wet ground to be handcuffed. Although no doubt this felony-type\narrest was extraordinarily unpleasant and inconvenient, as a matter of law, those actions by\nHaduch do not rise to the level of a constitutional violation.  \nPlaintiff’s claim against Commissioner Bealefeld alleges that he was responsible for\ndeveloping and implementing the policies of the BCPD, including the policy regarding\nwhen and under what circumstances persons are arrested “for minor traffic offenses”and\nwhen such persons are to be transported to CBIF. As Haduch committed no violation of\n5Cf. Wadkins v. Arnold, 214 F.3d 535, 541 & n.7 (4th Cir.) (“Reasonable law\nenforcement officers are not required to exhaust every potentially exculpatory lead or resolve\nevery doubt about a suspect's guilt before probable cause is established.”), cert. denied, 531 U.S.\n993 (2000).\n-9-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01953-CCB   Document 18   Filed 11/02/08   Page 10 of 12\nplaintiff’s Fourth Amendment rights in this regard, no claim lies against the Commissioner\non the basis of Haduch’s actions. \nFinally, plaintiff suggested at the hearing that the police defendants were sued on an\n“entrustment liability” theory, under which they are said to be liable for the acts and\nomissions of Secretary Maynard and Warden Williams for the searches occurring at CBIF.\nAs Judge Blake noted in Jones, the Fourth Circuit has neither adopted nor rejected an\n“entrustment liability” theory to § 1983 claims, 470 F. Supp. 2d at 552-53. Under an\nentrustment  theory,  the  plaintiff  must  show  that  the  defendant  has  (1)  a  policy  of\nentrustment; (2) knowledge of the constitutional violations at the detaining entity; and that\n(3) the entrusting entity must have had a choice over whether to follow the challenged\ncourse of action.  Id. at 553.  The gist of the theory is that a municipal body can be liable\nunder § 1983 if it maintains a policy of entrusting its arrestees to a jail or holding facility\nwith knowledge that arrestees will face unconstitutional treatment upon their confinement.\nId.  \nIn her carefully-reasoned analysis, Judge Blake concluded that the theory had no\napplicability to the circumstances in Baltimore City, as follows:\nImplicit in the policy component required to impose liability is that the\nentrusting entity has formulated the policy; that is, that it had a choice over\nwhether to follow the challenged course of action. See Powell v. Barrett, 2005\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 685, *37-38 (N.D.Ga.2005) (explaining that the entrusting\nentity cannot be liable “for constitutional injuries suffered by a detainee\nunless it had the authority to choose whether to entrust such a person to the\nfacility.”) (unpublished) (internal citations omitted). The City defendants\npersuasively argue that they have no choice because they are not legally\npermitted to maintain their own facility; therefore it would be unfair to hold\nthem liable for using the facility they are required to use by state law. (Mem.\n-10-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01953-CCB   Document 18   Filed 11/02/08   Page 11 of 12\nSupp. City Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss at 9; City Defs.’ Reply Mem. Supp. Mot.\nDismiss at 4-5.) See also Md.Code Ann., Corr. Servs. §§ 5-102, 201, 401, 404\n(2006). The steps which the plaintiffs contend the City defendants could have\ntaken to prevent violations of arrestees’ constitutional rights do not suggest\nthe existence of choice sufficient to give rise to liability. For instance, the\nplaintiffs argue that the City defendants could have filed a lawsuit against\nCBIC. (Pls.’ Opp’n Mot. Dismiss at 35.) In fact, the City attempted to\nintervene as a plaintiff in the state court suit regarding over detentions, but\nwas denied leave to do so. (Mem. Supp. City Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss at 12.) This\nillustrates the flaw with the argument that the ability to file a lawsuit shows\nthe existence of meaningful control: the court ultimately decides the outcome\nof the issues in a suit, thus filing a suit is, on some level, an admission that\nexternal help is needed to effectuate the desired results.\nThe plaintiffs also argue that there is a category of arrestees whose\nviolations could have been processed with citations and thus, in arresting\nthem, the City defendants essentially chose to take them to CBIC. (Pls.’\nOpp’n Mot. Dismiss at 42-43.) The complaint, however, does not identify\nsuch a group. Instead it categorizes the plaintiffs based on the types of\nconstitutional violations they allegedly suffered ( e.g., equal protection strip\nsearch class), and would make the City defendants liable for all persons in a\ngiven  category  of  violations,  even  if  the  underlying  arrest  was  clearly\njustified. (See City Defs.’ Reply Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss at 6.) There may\nbe a group for which citations could or should have been used; however, even\nif the plaintiffs had pled this, there would be significant concerns for the court\nin attempting to define the membership in this group, as doing so would likely\nnecessitate  more  judicial  assessment  of  discretionary  law  enforcement\npriorities and procedures than would be warranted. Therefore, the potential\nexistence of such a group fails to supply the element of choice necessary to\ngive rise to liability under the “entrustment liability” theory.\nBecause the court finds that the unique facts of this case render the\n“entrustment liability” theory inapplicable, there is no need to consider\narguments about its validity generally under Fourth Circuit law.\nId. at 553-54. I find this reasoning compelling. In particular, in light of recent Supreme\nCourt authority, see Virginia v. Moore, 128 S.Ct. 1598 (2008) (arresting officer commits no\nviolation of the Fourth Amendment simply because arrest, though supported by probable\ncause,  violated  state  law),  there  is  scant  justification  for  calling  into  question  the\n-11-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01953-CCB   Document 18   Filed 11/02/08   Page 12 of 12\ndiscretionary decision of Officer Haduch to arrest plaintiff rather than to issue a citation to\nplaintiff under the circumstances here.\nIV.\nFor the reasons stated herein, the motion to dismiss filed by defendants Maynard and\nWilliams is DENIED and those defendants shall file their answer to the complaint on or\nbefore November 24, 2008. In all other respects, the motions to dismiss are GRANTED and\nALL CLAIMS against the remaining defendants are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.  \nFiled: November 2, 2008    /s/                                               \nAndre M.

HADUCH, JR., et al.,  ) \n          ) \n      Defendants.  ) \n          ) \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF \nTHE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE’S \nMOTION TO DISMISS  \n \nThe Mayor and City Council of Baltimore (the “City”), by their undersigned \ncounsel, submits this memorandum of law in support of its motion to dismiss: \nINTRODUCTION \n  The Plaintiff, Rosemary Munyiri, filed this action against the City, as well as the \nCommissioner  of  the  Baltimore  Police  Department  and  a  number  of  other  parties \nallegedly arresting her without probable cause and with excessive force in violation of \nher constitutional rights.  Compl., ¶¶ 1 – 7.  Plaintiff  alleges inter alia, that “Defendant \nBaltimore City [sic] Police Department is, for all relevant legal and practical purposes \nherein, part of the government of the City of Baltimore.”  Compl., ¶¶ 25, 26.  It is from \nthis erroneous contention that Plaintiff’s claims against the City are premised.  See \nCompl., ¶¶ 136 - 46.   \n\n  For the most part, the City is not mentioned in any substantive allegation of the \nComplaint.  Rather, the Complaint mainly attempts to assert vicarious liability against the \nCity for the actions of members of the police department.  Compl., ¶¶ 25, 26.  Because, \nhowever, it is well established as a matter of law that the Baltimore Police Department is \na State institution run by employees of the State and not a City institution run by agents \nor  employees  of  the  City,  the  Complaint  cannot  state  a  claim  against  the  City  for \nvicarious liability.  Similarly, because the alleged actions of the police, even if they were \nagents  of  the  City,  cannot  be  the  basis  of  a  Section  1983  action  against  the  City, \nPlaintiff’s Complaint should be dismissed as to the City with prejudice. \nARGUMENT \nA.  THE BALTIMORE POLICE DEPARTMENT IS AN AGENCY OF THE STATE OF \nMARYLAND AND NOT OF THE CITY OF BALTIMORE. \n \nTo the extent that the Plaintiff seeks to hold the City liable under the doctrine of \nrespondeat  superior  for  the  actions  or  inaction  of  officers  of  the  Baltimore  Police \nDepartment, Plaintiff’s claim must be dismissed as a matter of law. \n  As a matter of well established law, respondeat superior liability requires an \nagency relationship between the wrongdoer and the defendant at the time of the alleged \nwrongful conduct.  See General Building Contractors Assoc., Inc. v. Pennsylvania, 458 \nU.S. 375, 392 (1982) (“respondeat superior . . . would not support the imposition of \nliability on a defendant based on the acts of a party with whom it had no agency or \nemployment relationship”).  See also Chevron. v. Lesch, 319 Md. 25, 32-33 (1990) \n(affirming  summary  judgment  determination  that  no  employer-employee  relationship \nexisted at time of alleged wrong); Gallagher’s Estate v. Battle, 209 Md. 592, 602 (1956) \n(acknowledging the existence of a principal-agent relationship in connection with alleged \n  2\n\ninjury as a necessary prerequisite to vicarious liability); Black’s Law Dictionary 1311-12 \n(6th  ed.  1990)  (“Doctrine  applies  only  when  relation  of  master  and  servant  existed \nbetween  defendant  and  wrongdoer  at  time  of  injury  sued  for,  in  respect  to  very \ntransaction from which it arose.”).  The party asserting a claim dependent upon an agency \nrelationship “bears the burden of proving its existence, including its nature and extent.” \nFare Deals, Ltd. v. World Choice Travel.Com, Inc., 180 F.Supp.2d 678, 685 (D.Md. \n2001) (citation omitted).     \nAs a matter of long standing Maryland law, the Baltimore Police Department \n(“BPD”) is an agency of the State of Maryland, not the City of Baltimore.  PUBLIC LOCAL \nLAWS OF MARYLAND, Art. 4, §16-2 (a) (“The Police Department of Baltimore City is \nhereby constituted and established as an agency and instrumentality of the State of \nMaryland.”); Clea v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, 312 Md. 662 (1988); Ashton \nv. Brown, 339 Md. 70, 104 n.18 (1995); Baltimore Police Department v. Cherkes, 140 \nMd. App. 282, 303-05, 323 (2001); Williams v. Baltimore, 128 Md. App. 1 (1999) rev’d \non other grounds, 359 Md. 101 (2000).  The Baltimore Police Department was removed \nfrom the control of the City and transferred to the State in 1860, Baltimore v. State, 15 \nMd. 376 (1860); H. H. Walker Lewis, The Baltimore Police Case of 1860, 26 MD. L. \nREV. 215 (1966), and it remains a State agency today. \nIn the instant matter, Plaintiff ignores well established law by contending that \nbecause the Police Commissioner “is appointed by the Mayor of the City of Baltimore \n[and] the organizational chart of the City of Baltimore lists the Baltimore City [sic] Police \nDepartment as a department of Baltimore City,” that the “Police Department is under the \ncontrol of Baltimore City. . . .”  Compl., ¶ 25.  See Mayor & City Council v. Clark, 404 \n  3\n\nMd. 13, 26, 27 (2008) (holding that despite the appointment of Commissioner, City does \nnot control police and police are State agents).  The City and its officials by law have no \ncontrol the operation of the Baltimore Police Department.  Clark, 404 Md. at 26, 27; \nBALT. CITY CHARTER, Art. II, §27; Adams v. Baltimore Transit Co., 203 Md. 295, 311 \n(1953); Upshur v. Baltimore, 94 Md. 743, 756 (1902); Baltimore v. State, 15 Md. 376 \n(1860).  As this Court recently held in Chin v. City of Baltimore, 241 F.Supp.2d 546, 549 \n(D. Md. 2003), “as a matter of Maryland law, the Baltimore City government does not \nwield enough control over the Baltimore Police Department to be subject to liability for \nthe Baltimore Police Department's actions.”(emphasis added).  As a result, the City \ncannot  be  liable  for  the  acts  or  omissions  of  the  officers  of  the  Baltimore  Police \nDepartment.    See  also,  Clea,  312  Md.  at  669-70  (“As  a  matter  of  Maryland  law, \nBaltimore  City  is  simply  not  [the  officers’]  employer  for  tort  liability \npurposes.”)(emphasis added).  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ claims against the City should be \ndismissed. \nB.  PLAINTIFF HAS FAILED TO STATE A CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIM AGAINST \nTHE CITY. \nThe Complaint attempts to assert a single claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against \nthe City.  Plaintiff, however, has not pled sufficient facts to state a constitutional claim \nagainst the City. \nMunicipalities can be subject to liability for violations of civil rights under certain \ncircumstances.  A municipality, however, “is only liable when it can be fairly said that \nthe city itself, not its servants, is the wrongdoer.”  Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 385 \n(1989).  It cannot, under the theory of respondeat superior, be held vicariously liable for \n  4\n\nthe actions of its agents or servants.  Monell v. New York Department of Social Services, \n436 U.S. 658, 694 (1978). \n“Local governing bodies...can be sued directly under Section 1983...where the \naction that is alleged to be unconstitutional implements or executes a policy statement, \nordinance,  regulation  or  decision  officially  adopted  and  promulgated  by  that  body’s \nofficers.”  Monell, 436 U.S. at 690.  A complaint which “appears to have merely attached \na conclusory allegation of ‘policy’ to what in essence is a claim based on a single \nunconstitutional act” must be dismissed. Giarrusso v. Chicago, 539 F. Supp. 690, 693 \n(N.D. Ill. 1982).  See also Daughtry v. Arlington County, Virginia, 490 F. Supp. 307, 311 \n(D.C. 1980) (plaintiffs “cannot rely on conclusory allegations but instead must plead facts \nwhich  show  that  a  county  policy  or  custom  directly  caused  injury  to  plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional rights”); Ivey v. Board of Regents of University of Alaska, 673 F.2d 266, \n268 (9th Cir. 1982) (“a liberal interpretation of a civil rights complaint may not supply \nessential elements of the claim that were not initially pled”).  Not only must the policy or \ncustom under attack be “fairly attributable to the municipality as its ‘own’,” it must also \nbe the “moving force” behind the particular constitutional violation.  Spell v. McDaniel, \n824 F.2d 1380, 1387 (4th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1027 (1988). \n  In the present case, Plaintiff alleges only that members of the Baltimore Police \nused excessive force which allegedly violated her rights.  Plaintiff has failed to allege any \nfacts to show a policy, custom or practice of anyone, much less of the City, that was the \nmoving force behind the alleged deprivation of her rights.  While she has sprinkled in a \nfew conclusory allegations about policies, Plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to \nshow a direct link between any City policy and any alleged deprivation of Plaintiff’s \n  5\n\nrights.  Plaintiff cannot demonstrate that the excessive force or warrantless arrest was \ncaused by a policy of the City (as opposed to some other policy).  Indeed, as set forth \nmore fully herein, the City does not as a matter of law control or establish Police policy.  \nTherefore, the Complaint does not and cannot contain sufficient factual allegations to \nsupport  a  claim  of  municipal  liability  and  the  Court  should  dismiss  the  Plaintiff’s \nconstitutional claims with prejudice. \n  C.  AS A MATTER OF LAW, PLAINTIFF CANNOT STATE A CONSTITUTIONAL  \n    CLAIM AGAINST THE CITY. \nThe Court should dismiss Plaintiff’s Section 1983 claim against the City with \nprejudice, because as a matter of law, Plaintiff cannot state a constitutional claim against \nthe City.  In order to be liable for police misconduct, the City must have been a “final \npolicy maker.”  Pembaur v. Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469 (1986).  It is State law that defines \nthe relationship between the municipality and its officials and the police department and \nthat determines whether the municipality or its official is to be deemed a policy maker for \nfederal  law  purposes.    St.  Louis  v.  Praprotnik,  485  U.S.  112,  124  (1988)  (“the \nidentification of policy making official is a question of state law”). \nIn McMillian v. Monroe County, Ala., 520 U.S. 781 (1997), the Supreme Court \nconsidered whether an Alabama county sheriff was a policy maker in the area of law \nenforcement for county or for the State.  The Court emphasized that its inquiry was \ndependent on an analysis of state law, id. at 786, and that, although the simple labeling of \nan official as a state or county official would not answer the inquiry, “our understanding \nof the actual function of a governmental official, in a particular area, will necessarily be \ndependent on the definition of the official’s functions under relevant state law.”  Id. \n  6\n\n  Even though the sheriffs were paid and equipped by the county, each sheriff’s \njurisdiction was limited to the borders of his county and sheriffs were elected locally, the \nCourt concluded that sheriffs were acting for the State when engaged in law enforcement.  \nId. at 791-793.  Sheriffs were State policy makers because (1) sheriffs were required to \nperform duties for the state courts; (2) sheriffs were charged by law with the duty and \nauthority to enforce the state criminal laws; (3) counties had no law enforcement powers; \nand  (4)  county  commissioners  could  not  instruct  or  direct  sheriffs  in  their  law \nenforcement activities.  Id. at 789-91. \n  When the nature of the BPD is considered under a McMillian analysis, it becomes \napparent that police officers of the BPD, when engaged in law enforcement activities, are \nState actors or policy makers.  As noted above, the General Assembly constituted the \nBPD as an agency of the State, intending to remove the police force from the City’s \ncontrol.  Like the Alabama sheriffs, police officers of the BPD have been given the duty \nand authority to enforce the State’s criminal laws.  PUBLIC LOCAL LAWS OF MARYLAND, \nArt. 4, §§16-2 and 16-3.  Moreover, like the counties in McMillian, the City government \nhas no law enforcement powers.  See, e.g., Green v. Baltimore, 181 Md. 372, 374 (1943); \nAdams v. Baltimore Transit Co., 203 Md. 295, 311 (1953) (City is deprived of the power \nof enforcing its ordinances); and Baltimore v. Silver, 263 Md. 439, 441 (1971) (“…the \nCity has no power with regard to the enforcement of the law….”).  In addition, again like \nthe counties in McMillian, the City and its officials are prohibited from exercising any \ncontrol over the BPD.  See Chin, 241 F.Supp.2d at 549; BALT. CITY CHARTER, Art. II, \n§27, supra. \n  Accordingly, the Complaint should be dismissed with prejudice. \n  7\n\nD.  ASSUMING ARGUENDO, THAT THE CITY COULD BE HELD LIABLE \n  UNDER ANY CLAIM, PLAINTIFF NONETHELESS CANNOT RECOVER \n  PUNITIVE DAMAGES. \n \nPlaintiff seeks punitive damages as part of her judgment against the City.  It is \nwell  established,  however,  that  punitive  damages  cannot  be  recovered  against  a \nmunicipality such as the City for actions as alleged in the Complaint.  Rather, punitive \ndamages may only be awarded in an action brought under § 1983 “when the defendant's \nconduct is shown to be motivated by evil motive or intent, or when it involves reckless or \ncallous indifference to the federally protected rights of others.”  Smith v. Wade, 461 U.S. \n30, 56 (1983).  In Kolstad v. Ada, 527 U.S. 526 (1999), the Court discussed the intent \nneeded for punitive damages: \nMost often, however, eligibility for punitive awards is characterized in \nterms of a defendant's motive or intent.  See, e.g., 1 Sedgwick, supra, at \n526, 528; C. McCormick, Law of Damages 280 (1935).  Indeed, “the \njustification of exemplary damages lies in the evil intent of the defendant.”  \n1 Sedgwick, supra, at 526; see also 2 J. Sutherland, Law of Damages § \n390, p. 1079 (3d ed. 1903) (discussing punitive damages under rubric of \n“compensation  for  wrongs  done  with  bad  motive”).    Accordingly,  “a \npositive  element  of  conscious  wrongdoing  is  always  required.”  \nMcCormick, supra, at 280. \nId. at 538.  Thus, case law emphasizes the need for bad motive or intent on the part of a \ndefendant.  At the least, there must be conscious wrongdoing.  The instant Complaint \npresents on of this. \n   Here, Plaintiff has not alleged, and cannot allege, any facts to show an evil \nmotive on the part of the City or the intent on the part of the City to injure Ms. Munyiri \nor anything to support a claim for punitive damages against the City.  Accordingly, the \nPlaintiffs’ claims for punitive damages should be dismissed. \n \n  8\n\nCONCLUSION \n  For all the foregoing reasons, the Court should dismiss the Complaint as to the \nCity with prejudice.   \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n \n/s/______________________ \n            DAVID E.
