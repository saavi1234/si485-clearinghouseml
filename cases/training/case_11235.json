The state court granted a Temporary Restraining Order against planned demonstrations at the Board of Education offices protesting budget cuts and the privatization of certain school functions.  After the students' counsel (Kairys, Rudovsky, Messing, Feinberg) who appeared in the case, the injunction was lifted when the parties reached a shared understanding of ground rules for the demonstration.   No opinions were written.   Our information on the case comes from the students' counsel; we have no written records.  </p>",
