Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that he was singled out for filing a complaint against a corrections officer, and denied due process by the WSP warden, who did not allow him to present evidence in his favor during his disciplinary hearing. The plaintiff was represented by the Wyoming ALCU, and sought declaratory and injunctive relief. </p><p>On October 28, 2008, approximately 25 prisoners at WSP witnessed an altercation between a guard and a prisoner.  The plaintiff claimed to see one of the guards intentionally and unnecessarily kick the prisoner in the head while he was shackled and held beneath several additional guards. When the plaintiff indicated to the officers that he intended to file a complaint against their conduct, he was threatened with a disciplinary action. When the officer did file a grievance against the officer, he was sanctioned. Thereafter, he was not allowed by the officer reviewing his disciplinary sanction to call witnesses who had overheard the threatened action, or others who had witnessed the guards kick the prisoner in the head.  </p><p>The plaintiff alleged that the Warden summarily denied his appeal of the disciplinary sanction because he did not present any evidence (which he was not allowed to do by the reviewing officer). The plaintiff was put into solitary confinement for two months as a result.</p><p>The plaintiff filed suit alleging violations of his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The plaintiff challenged the disciplinary procedures and the specific policy of overly redacting documents provided to prisoners that were non-confidential.</p><p>On July 30, 2009, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the suit. He was no longer a prisoner at WSP, and was living at home with his ailing mother as her full-time caregiver in a bordering state. According to the stipulation of dismissal, he could not attend the depositions and maintain the action along with his caregiving responsibilities. The Court (Judge Alan B. Johnson) dismissed the case without ruling on class certification on the same day. </p><p>The case was not closed, and it was not dismissed with prejudice. However, because the plaintiff may have lost standing to restart the action, this case is likely over.</p><p></p>",

Everyone turned to observe it.  Suddenly, Wiseman sprayed Bartlett \nin  the  face  with  oleoresin  capsicum  (pepper  spray).    Within  moments,  eight \nadditional guards arrived.  Several guards (according to their own reports) yelled \nat prisoners to return to their cells, while other guards yelled at Bartlett as they \ntook him down on his stomach, shackled his hands behind his back, and pressed \non  his  back  and  neck  to  prevent  him  from  moving.    Bartlett  previously  had \nextensive surgery on his lungs.  His medical condition, the weight of the guards \non his back, and the effects of the pepper spray made breathing difficult.  Bartlett \nfelt he was going to suffocate, and he implored the guards to give him some air.  \nAt this point, it appeared that Defendant Grubbe kicked Bartlett in the head.  \nImmediately,  at  least  15  prisoners  started  yelling  on  Bartlett's  behalf,  asking \nguards to allow him to breathe and complaining about the guards' conduct. \n  Plaintiff Joseph Miller, a prisoner housed in B-2, had an unobstructed view \nof the entire incident and saw Grubbe's shoe hit Bartlett's head.  As he entered \nhis cell, Miller told the guards he was going to report what he saw.  When guards \nGrubbe and Prindle heard this, they went to Miller's cell and warned that if he \nreported  anything,  he  would  be  \"in  trouble.\"    They  swore  at  Miller.    Miller \nrepeated  that  he  was  going  to  submit  a  report,  whereupon  Prindle  advised \n  2\n\nGrubbe  to  issue  disciplinary  charges  against  Miller  that  Prindle  knew  were \nunfounded.  Despite these threats, Miller sent a grievance to Warden Murphy \nbecause he felt it was the right thing to do.  Several hours later, Grubbe retaliated \nby issuing false charges against Miller. \n  Numerous witnesses will testify at trial that at least 15 prisoners were \nyelling at the guards.  Only one of them, Joseph Miller, received disciplinary \ncharges as a result.  The reason for the difference in treatment is that Miller is the \nonly prisoner who reported to Warden Murphy what he had observed.  Miller was \nretaliated against for reporting misconduct. \nAt his November 28, 2008 disciplinary hearing, Miller requested that five \nprisoners who had witnessed this incident be called to testify.  These men would \nconfirm Miller's testimony both as to the guards' conduct towards Bartlett and the \nretaliation against Miller.  The hearing officer, Defendant Goodman, however, \nrefused to allow any of these witnesses to testify.  Instead, Goodman summarily \nfound Miller guilty, sentencing him to 90 days in solitary confinement.    \nMiller appealed his conviction to Warden Murphy.  Murphy denied Miller's \nappeal  and  affirmed  the  sentence,  claiming  that  Miller  had  submitted  \"no \nevidence\" in his support.  Murphy deliberately overlooked the fact that Miller had \nbeen prevented by Goodman from presenting testimony from five eyewitnesses.  \nThus, the disciplinary charges, the disciplinary hearing, the resulting convictions, \nand  Murphy's  biased  and  close-minded  review  violated  Miller's  constitutional \nrights.  Plaintiff Miller seeks declaratory and injunctive relief and damages.   \n  3\n\nThis action is also filed as a class action on behalf of all WSP prisoners.  \nThe class challenges a practice of Warden Murphy that violates state and federal \nlaw.  Murphy has a practice of withholding from the public, including prisoners, \ncertain information contained in non-confidential prison reports that he has no \nlegitimate reason to conceal, and his doing so is inconsistent with our democratic \nform of government.  Declaratory and injunctive relief (but not damages) are \nsought on this class claim. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n1.  This action seeks relief under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to \nthe United States Constitution and 42 U.S.C ยง 1983.  Accordingly, 28 U.S.C. ยงยง \n1343(3) and (4) confer jurisdiction on the Court.  Plaintiff's claims arising under \nWyoming law may be adjudicated pursuant to the Court's pendent jurisdiction.  \nVenue is appropriate in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b).   \nPARTIES \n2.  Plaintiff Joseph Miller is serving a criminal sentence in the state of \nWyoming and is incarcerated in the Wyoming State Penitentiary (WSP).  Plaintiff \nhas  been  placed  under  the  care,  custody,  and  control  of  the  Wyoming \nDepartment of Corrections (WDOC).   \n3.  Defendants Michael Grubbe, Lonnie Prindle, and Clyde Goodman \nare citizens and residents of Wyoming and are correctional officers employed at \nWSP.   \n  4\n\n4.  Defendant Michael Murphy is a citizen and resident of Wyoming.  At \nall times relevant to this action, Murphy was (and is) the Warden of WSP.  As \nsuch, he has a duty to operate and administer WSP in a manner consistent with \nstate and federal law.    \n5.    All  acts  and  omissions  of  Defendants  described  below  were  done \nunder  color  of  state  law  and  were  performed  during  the  scope  of  their \nemployment.  Each Defendant is sued in his official and individual capacities. \nCLASS ACTION \n  6.  Plaintiff Miller brings this action on his own behalf and also on behalf of \nall other WSP prisoners, present and future.  All WSP prisoners are being denied \ntheir rights under state and federal law to obtain copies of prison incident reports \nand  other  non-confidential  prison  records  without  Warden  Murphy  censoring \ninformation he has no right to censor.  Class certification is sought pursuant to \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 23(a), (b)(1) and (2).  The class seeks \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief only.   \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n \n7. Prisoners at WSP are permitted to possess only a small amount of \npersonal  property  in  their  cells.    Consequently,  the  property  that  prisoners \nchoose to retain tends to be important and meaningful to them, such as family \nphotographs, legal materials, bibles, books, and letters from friends and family. \n8.  When prisoners first arrive at WSP, and when they are moved within \nthe  prison  to  particular  housing  units,  their  personal  property  is  sent  to  the \n  5\n\nprison's Property Office for inventory and inspection.  The employee currently in \ncharge of the Property Office is guard Bryan Wiseman. \n9.    For  many  weeks  prior  to  October  28,  2008,  Warden  Murphy  had \nreceived complaints from prison staff and prisoners that Wiseman was grossly \nmismanaging  the  Property  Office,  often  misplacing  property  and  frequently \nmisleading prisoners as to when he was going to return their property to them. \n10.  Prison documents show, for instance, that at least one sergeant and \none  case  worker  specialist  had  already  notified  WSP  administrators  that \nWiseman's mishandling of prisoner property and his misleading prisoners about \nwhen  he  would  return  their  possessions  were  causing  such  disruption  and \nmalcontent that staff safety was threatened.   \n11.  Unfortunately, these warnings went unheeded, and proved prescient.  \nOn October 28, 2008, a violent incident erupted that easily could have been \navoided had Murphy properly trained and supervised Wiseman. \n12.  As a result of a cell change months earlier, the personal property of \nprisoner Ryan Bartlett was sent to the Property Office.  Property Officer Wiseman \nhad returned a portion of Bartlett's property but would not return the rest, despite \npromises to do so.  In the previous ten weeks, Bartlett had sent at least eight \nInmate Requests to Wiseman, to no avail.   \n13.  Just after lunch on October 28, 2008, Wiseman entered the dayroom \nof Housing Unit B-2.  Approximately 25 prisoners were in the room, including \nRyan Bartlett.  When Bartlett saw Wiseman, he asked him about his missing \n  6\n\nproperty.  Wiseman, however, gave Bartlett the same brush off he had given him \nfor ten weeks.  Bartlett raised his voice, and kept asking about his property.  \nSuddenly, Wiseman grabbed his oleoresin capsicum (pepper spray) and sprayed \nhim in the eyes, nose, and mouth. \n14.    Within  moments,  eight  additional  guards  arrived  at  the  scene.  \nSeveral of them helped Wiseman take Bartlett to the ground on his stomach, \nshackled his hands behind his back, and then pressed on his back and neck with \ntheir hands and knees to restrain him.  Other guards were yelling at the prisoners \nin the dayroom, ordering them to go to their individual cells. \n15.  Bartlett has had extensive surgery on his lungs.  Many prisoners in B-\n2 were aware of this, and had seen the large vertical scar on his chest. \n16.  After Bartlett was taken to the ground and guards placed their weight \non his back and neck, he began screaming \"I can't breathe.  I can't breathe.\"  \nBartlett will testify at trial that he thought he was going to suffocate due to the \npepper spray in his lungs, and because the guards were compressing his chest \nwith their weight.  He also thought he was having a heart attack.1 \n                     \n \n1A staff report filed by one of the guards involved in the take \ndown of Ryan Bartlett acknowledges that Bartlett \"complained that he \ncouldn't breathe [and] requested that we let him up,\" and that Bartlett \ntold  the  guards  \"he  thought  he  was  having  a  heart  attack.\"  Another \nstaff report states that while Bartlett was on the ground he \"began \ncomplaining  of  chest  pain  and  telling  us  to  get  off  his  chest.\"  \nPlaintiff  Miller  is  unable  to  identify  the  guards  who  wrote  these \nreports due to the illegal redaction by Warden Murphy of their names, \nan issue that he and the class seek to redress in this lawsuit. \n  7\n\n17.  Most of the 25 prisoners in the room were yelling at the guards on \nBartlett's behalf, asking that they allow Bartlett to breathe and complaining about \nthe use of excessive force.  At this point, Bartlett felt a blow to the side of his \nhead, which came from the foot of Defendant Grubbe.2  Observing this, prisoners \nbegan yelling even louder. \n18.  Plaintiff Joseph Miller had an unobstructed view of what Grubbe did.  \nThe officers had instructed all prisoners to return to their cells, and Miller's cell \nwas located directly across from where the incident was taking place.  Miller \nwatched as Grubbe's shoe hit Bartlett's head. \n19.  Prisoners protested.  Some started swearing at the guards, but Miller, \nwho rarely uses profanity, was not one of them.  Miller's voice was no louder than \nthe 15 other prisoners who were making statements.   \n20.    From  inside  his  cell,  Miller  told  the  guards  that  he  planned  on \nreporting Grubbe's conduct to the Warden.  As soon as Grubbe heard this, he \nwent directly to Miller's cell.  As several witnesses will testify, Grubbe told Miller, \n\"You'd better mind your own fโฆโฆ business or you'll be in trouble.\" \n21.  Miller told Grubbe that he intended on filing a report.  This prompted \nanother guard, Defendant Lonnie Prindle, to join Grubbe at Miller's cell.  Prindle \ntold Miller to stay out of this.  Prindle swore at Miller.  When Miller said again that \n                     \n \n2According to a staff report, Bartlett told a sergeant the day of \nthe  incident  \"that  someone  either  kicked  him  or  punched  him  in  the \nhead.\"  Bartlett, who had just been sprayed in the face with mace, \ncould not identify the officer who had hit him.  Numerous prisoners \nwill identify Grubbe as the perpetrator. \n  8\n\nhe was going to file a report, Prindle turned to Grubbe and told him, \"Write him \nup for calling you a mโฆโฆ fโฆ.., and I'll witness it.\"  Prindle knew that Miller had \nsaid no such thing.   \n22.  Grubbe followed Prindle's advice.  Grubbe wrote a Staff Report that \nfalsely accuses Miller of yelling through his cell door and calling Grubbe a \"stupid \npiece of sโฆ\" and a \"mโฆ.. fโฆ..\"   \n23.    Witnesses  will  testify  that  not  only  did  Miller  not  make  those \nstatements, it is virtually inconceivable he ever would. \n24.  Plaintiff Miller submitted his grievance to Warden Murphy by 3 p.m. \nthat afternoon.  Of the nine guards involved in the incident, Grubbe was the last \none to file his Staff Report, submitting it at 6:57 p.m.  It would appear that Grubbe \ndelayed his report to see if Miller would be submitting a grievance.    \n25.  Grubbe's Staff Report states that he was charging Miller with two \ndisciplinary  infractions.    Those  charges  were,  to  quote  the  report,  \"a  GN-9 \n(Abusive  language  or  actions  towards  another  person.)  and  a  MJ-15  (False \nPretenses: Representation of some fact or circumstance which is not true and is \ncalculated to mislead, deceive or defraud another.)\"  \n26.  These charges were fabrications and entirely retaliatory.   \n27.    No  fewer  than  15  prisoners  made  critical  accusations  about  the \nguards' misconduct.  Yet only Plaintiff Miller was charged with GN9 and MJ15 \ninfractions. \n  9\n\n28.  Grubbe was a pod officer assigned to B-2 that day, and remained in \nB-2  after  the  incident.    As  witnesses  will  testify  at  trial,  prisoners  continued \nthroughout  the  afternoon  to  verbally  confront  Grubbe  concerning  his  actions, \nquestioning why he had kicked Bartlett in the head.   \n29.  Shortly after the incident with Bartlett, Grubbe walked through the \nrotunda of the pod and at least ten prisoners verbally accused him of having \nkicked  Bartlett  in  the  head  and  made  derogatory  remarks  about  Grubbe's \nconduct.    Not  a  single  one  of  these  prisoners  was  charged  with  \"abusive \nlanguage,\" \"false pretenses,\" or any other infraction. \n30.    There  was  no  legitimate  reason  to  single  out  Miller  for  \"abusive \nlanguage\" or \"false pretenses\" when at least 15 other prisoners were engaging in \nmore egregious conduct than Miller.  Miller observed Grubbe's foot hit Bartlett in \nthe  head,  said  as  much,  and  stated  his  intention  to  file  a  report.    Several \nwitnesses, in fact, will admit that their statements about Grubbe's actions were \nfar more \"abusive\" than Miller's.  Whereas some prisoners swore at the guards \nand called them names, Miller confined his comments to what he had actually \nobserved and said he would be filing a report about it.   \n31.  That evening while Miller was eating in the dining room, a lieutenant \nsummoned Miller into the hallway and sought to convince him not to report what \nhe had observed.  The lieutenant threatened Miller by telling him that he would \nspend the rest of his sentence in segregation if he proceeded with his complaint, \nand suggested that Miller send the grievance to him instead.  Miller told the \n  10\n\nlieutenant that he intended on pursuing his grievance with the Warden but that he \nwould also write one for the lieutenant, which Miller did. \n32.  On October 29, 2008, the day after Miller submitted his grievance, \nMiller was removed from his cell and placed in segregation pending a hearing on \ndisciplinary charges. \n33.  Grubbe's Staff Report accuses Miller of committing two -- and only \ntwo -- disciplinary infractions.   \n34.  However, someone added a third infraction to Miller's charges.  Miller \ndoes not know who added this charge, and no staff report mentions or supports \nit.  This additional charge was equally as bogus as the first two.  Miller was \ncharged  with  an  MJ26,  which  the  Code  of  Inmate  Discipline  defines  as: \n\"Organizing,  encouraging  or  participating  in  a  work  stoppage  and/or  other \ndisruptive demonstration or practice.\" \n35.  Miller entered a plea of not guilty to all three charges.  He was \nafforded a disciplinary hearing on November 28, 2008, and Defendant Clyde \nGoodman was the Hearing Officer. \n36.  On his hearing forms, Miller listed the names of five prisoners from B-\n2 as his witnesses.  All of them were eyewitnesses.  Goodman, however, refused \nto allow a single one of them to testify.  These witnesses would have confirmed \nthat Miller's statements were less offensive in content and tone as those made by \nsome 15 other prisoners.  Indeed, Miller might have been the only prisoner not \nusing profanity.  Some of these witnesses would also have testified that they \n  11\n\nheard Grubbe and Prindle threaten Miller with retaliation if he reported to the \nWarden what they had done. \n37.  At the conclusion of the hearing, Defendant Goodman dismissed the \nGN9  charge  (abusive  language)  but  found  Miller  guilty  of  the  remaining  two \ncharges, despite a lack of evidence supporting either one and despite the fact \nthat Goodman had prevented Miller from presenting corroborating evidence from \neyewitnesses.   \n38.  Goodman sentenced Miller to 180 days in segregation, with 90 days \nsuspended.  Prior to imposing this sentence, Goodman reviewed a letter Warden \nMurphy had sent Miller four days earlier.  Murphy stated in his letter that Miller's \ncharges were \"relatively minor\" and Miller should expect to be released from \nsegregation \"before the end of this week.\"  \n39.  Miller appealed his conviction to Warden Murphy, but Murphy rejected \nMiller's appeal.  In a decision dated January 9, 2009, Murphy claims that he \nreviewed  \"the  procedure  utilized  during  the  Disciplinary  process  and  the \nconclusion and sanction concluding the Hearing process,\" and found no error.   \n40.  Murphy states in his January 9 decision that there is \"no evidence to \nsupport  your  claim  that  [the  Notice  of  Charges]  was  done  in  retaliation.\"  \nMurphy's contention is both false and disingenuous.  It is false because Miller \nsubmitted detailed evidence of retaliation during the hearing through his own \ntestimony.    It  is  disingenuous  because  Goodman  had  prevented  Miller  from \n  12\n\nsubmitting testimony from corroborating witnesses, a fact the Warden fails to \nmention.   \n41.  What Murphy did in accusing Miller of failing to submit evidence is \nakin to placing a prisoner in a straight-jacket and then finding him guilty of an \ninfraction for failing to submit a written statement. \n42.  The best evidence that Miller could have presented in defending \nagainst these particular charges was eyewitness testimony.  Murphy had to have \nknown  that  Goodman's  refusal  to  permit  Miller  to  call  eyewitnesses  was \nfundamentally unfair.  Such a one-sided hearing could not possibly be lawful. \n43.  In addition to appealing his disciplinary conviction to Warden Murphy, \nPlaintiff  Miller  filed  a  separate  grievance  alleging  that  he  was  the  victim  of \nretaliation.  The Warden dismissed Miller's grievance using the same bankrupt \nrationale  he  employed  in  rejecting  his  disciplinary  appeal.    First,  Murphy \nerroneously contends that Miller was \"afforded the opportunity to give your side \nof  the  story  to  the  disciplinary  hearing  committee.\"    Second,  Murphy  falsely \ncontends that the hearing process was \"appropriate\" and that Miller's claim of \nretaliation  was  supported  by  \"no  evidence.\"    Noticeably  lacking  in  Murphy's \ndecision, again, is the fact that Miller was prohibited from calling witnesses.  \n44.    The  record  of  the  disciplinary  hearing  contains  not  a  scintilla  of \nevidence to support a conviction under MJ26.  No Staff Report refers to such a \ncharge  or  cites  any  facts  showing  the  Miller's  statements  caused  any  work \nstoppage or disruption.  Goodman should have dismissed that charge. \n  13\n\n45.  Had Goodman conducted a fair hearing, as he was constitutionally \nrequired to do, he would have learned that at least 15 other prisoners were \nyelling at the guards--more stridently than Miller--and thus the MJ26 charge was \npatently absurd, discriminatory, and retaliatory. \n46.  Miller's statements on October 28, 2008, caused no more disruption \nor work stoppage than the statements made at the same time by at least 15 other \nprisoners, none of whom was cited for committing an MJ26.   \n47.  Accusing Miller of \"abusive language\" and \"work stoppage\" is a cover-\nup for Defendants' retaliatory and discriminatory actions against Miller. \n48.  Plaintiff Miller appealed Warden Murphy's decision to the Director of \nthe Wyoming Department of Corrections, Robert Lampert.  Lampert agreed with \nPlaintiff Miller that Murphy's decision must be reversed.  Lampert found that \nmistakes made by Goodman during the disciplinary hearing rendered Miller's \nconviction indefensible.  Lampert ordered that Miller be afforded a new hearing. \n49.  Following Lampert's reversal of Murphy's decision, Miller was asked \nby WSP Captain Curruthers on January 30, 2009, to participate that day in a new \nhearing.  Miller told Curruthers that he was scheduled to meet with his attorney \non February 10 and asked Curruthers to postpone the hearing until after that \ndate.  Prison rules expressly provide that prisoners have a right to consult with \ncounsel prior to a disciplinary hearing, and Curruthers therefore granted Miller's \nrequest for a postponement. \n  14\n\n50.  The sheet that prisoners are given prior to their disciplinary hearings \ninforms them that they have a right \"to consult with private counsel prior to the \nhearing.\" \n51.  On February 4, 2009, however, Curruthers informed Miller that his \nhearing  was  going  to  be  held  that  day.    Miller  reminded  Curruthers  of  the \nconversation they had had on January 30 and again requested a postponement \nuntil after his February 10 consultation with counsel.  Curruthers refused to allow \na postponement.   \n52.  There were no exigent circumstances requiring that Miller's hearing \nbe held prior to February 10, 2009. \n53.  Indeed, Director Lampert's decision ordering a new hearing for Miller \ninformed him that the hearing would be held within three weeks.  That deadline \nwould  not  have  expired  on  February  10,  2009.    Miller's  request  for  a \npostponement was thus within the time frame contemplated by Director Lampert.   \n54.  In direct contravention of prison rules allowing prisoners to consult \nwith counsel prior to a disciplinary hearing, Curruthers wrote on the hearing form \nthat  Miller  had  \"refused  to  participate\"  in  his  hearing.    That  statement  is \ninaccurate, and Curruthers knew it.  In truth, Miller did not refuse to participate in \nhis  hearing,  but  merely  requested  a  postponement  consistent  with  prison \nregulations.  In denying that request, prison officials once again violated their \nown policies in their rush to deny Miller a fair hearing and find him guilty. \n  15\n\n55.  As noted earlier, the incident that gave rise to these events occurred \non October 28, 2008.  Miller submitted his grievance to Warden Murphy the \nsame  day,  and  was  placed  in  segregation  the  next  day.    He  remained  in \nsegregation  until  December  24,  2008.    He  was  inexplicably  released  from \nsegregation by Warden Murphy prior to the expiration of his 90-day sentence, \neven though Murphy believes that Miller's hearing, conviction, and sentence were \nentirely appropriate. \n56.  The actions of the four Defendants described above were undertaken \nwith reckless disregard for Plaintiff Miller's constitutional rights and were done in \na deliberate and malicious attempt to retaliate against him for calling attention to \nwhat he perceived to be the unnecessary use of force on another prisoner. \n57.  Warden Murphy committed six errors that proximately caused Plaintiff \nMiller's injuries.  First, he failed to adequately train and supervise Property Officer \nWiseman and ignored complaints about Wiseman's misconduct.  Second, he \nfailed to adequately supervise and train Defendant Goodman in order to ensure \nthat Goodman conducted fair disciplinary hearings.  Third, Murphy deliberately \noverlooked inherently prejudicial procedural defects in Plaintiff Miller's hearing \nthat,  as  Director  Lampert  concluded,  rendered  the  conviction  unsupportable.  \nFourth, Murphy sought to cover up those procedural defects by accusing Miller of \nhaving failed to produce evidence, when Murphy knew it was Goodman's fault \nthat  such  evidence  was  precluded  from  the  hearing.    Fifth,  when  Murphy \nreviewed the record on appeal, he had to have seen that no staff report alleged \n  16\n\nthat Miller had committed an MJ26 offense and no evidence of disruption or work \nstoppage had been presented at the hearing.  Lastly, Murphy's review of the \nrecord on appeal must also have revealed to him the flagrant contradictions and \ninconsistencies in the statements submitted by his staff that clearly show that \nsome  guards  were  not  telling  the  truth.    Rather  than  affirm  Plaintiff  Miller's \nconviction, Warden Murphy should have dismissed all charges against Mr. Miller. \n58.  Miller appealed Curruthers' decision of February 4, 2009, that found \nthat Miller had \"refused to participate\" in his hearing.  On February 23, 2009, \nMiller was offered a new hearing.  Miller presented evidence from himself and \nthree eyewitnesses that his statements were less abusive than those made by \nsome 15 other prisoners, and that officers had threatened him with retaliation \nwhen he announced his intention to report what he had observed.  Yet Miller was \nagain found guilty.  This finding of guilt was retaliatory and inconsistent with the \nevidence. \n59.    Defendant  Grubbe  is  aware  that  he  used,  or  that  persons  might \nreasonably believe he used, excessive force on Ryan Bartlett.  The day after the \nincident, Grubbe went to Bartlett's cell and told him that he did not mean to hit \nhim in the head. \n60.    Defendants  are  also  aware  that  Bryan  Wiseman  may  have  used \nexcessive force on Ryan Bartlett.  Although an internal review cleared Wiseman, \nthis investigation was a whitewash.  In the first place, it failed to take into account \nan officer who observed the entire incident and who later testified that Wiseman \n  17\n\ndid not have a valid reason to use pepper spray on Bartlett.  Moreover, the \ninternal  investigation  also  failed  to  interview  any  of  the  25  prisoners  who \nobserved the incident.  The prison's internal review was not designed to obtain \nthe truth. \nOverly-Redacted Prison Documents and Withholding Prison Documents \n  61.  Prior to filing this lawsuit, Plaintiff Miller submitted a request (through \ncounsel) to the Wyoming Attorney General's office for photocopies of the staff \nreports that guards submitted to the WSP administration in connection with this \nincident and a copy of the Use of Force investigation that was conducted by the \nprison in connection with the pepper spraying and restraint of Ryan Bartlett.  \nWhen these reports were sent, every officer's name had been redacted from \nthese documents, including the names of the authors of the staff reports. \n  62.  Defendants are aware that these documents are not exempt from \ndisclosure under state or federal law.   This explains why Defendants provided \nthe reports rather than claimed a privilege to withhold them. \n63.  Neither state nor federal law authorizes Defendants to redact the \nnames of prison employees from these non-confidential documents.  Indeed, this \nvery issue was litigated and resolved adversely to Warden Murphy by this Court \nin  Skinner  v.  Uphoff,  2005  WL  4089333  (D.  Wyo.  2005).    There,  as  here, \nDefendants sought to prevent WSP prisoners--the same class of plaintiffs here--\nfrom learning the identities of WSP employees involved in prison investigations \nand  incidents  of  violence.    The  Court  held  that  \"non-confidential  information \n  18\n\nshould be available to the inmates and the public.\" Skinner, 2005 WL 408933 * 3.  \nThe Court reasoned that \"the public has a right, and even a responsibility, to \nreview the investigative reports.\" Id., citing Allsop v. Cheyenne Newspapers, Inc., \n39 P.3d 1092, 1096 (Wyo. 2002).  The Court then listed the information that was \nconfidential and therefore subject to redaction from WSP reports. Id. at *3-*4.  \nNotably, the Court did not authorize redacting the names of employees involved \nin these incidents nor redacting the names of the authors of these staff reports. \n64.  Prior to the Court's ruling in Skinner, Defendants were redacting the \nnames of employees and authors from all incident and investigative reports they \nsent  to  counsel  for  Plaintiffs.    After  the  Court's  ruling,  Defendants  ceased \nredacting those names from these documents.  Thus, it is clear that the Court \nhad ruled--and Defendants knew that the Court had ruled--that Defendants must \ncease redacting employee identifications from these incident and investigative \nreports. \n65.  Concealing the names of the authors of these non-confidential staff \nreports, as well as the names of the employees mentioned in them, is contrary to \nthe principles of a democratic society, which promotes an open government, and \nviolates the principles set forth in the Court's prior ruling on this same issue.   \n66.    Defendants  have  no  compelling  interest  that  necessitates  the \nredaction  of  the  names  of  employees  from  these  documents,  as  these \ndocuments do not involve disciplinary matters against employees, health records, \nor any other subject privileged under state or federal law. \n  19\n\n67.  Prisoner Bartlett requested a copy of the Use of Force investigation \ninvolving the October 28, 2008 incident so that he could assess whether his \ntestimony had been fairly summarized in the report and whether the investigation \nreached a reasonable conclusion as to whether excessive force had been used \nagainst him.  Bartlett submitted a written request for a copy of the report, which \nrequest  was  denied.    During  his  hearing,  he  asked  the  Hearing  Officer \n(Defendant Goodman) if he could examine a copy of the report, given that the \nreport was being considered as evidence.  Goodman contacted Warden Murphy.  \nAs the tape of Bartlett's hearing will show, Murphy refused to allow Bartlett to \nreview the report, even though no document in the report is confidential under \nstate or federal law.    \n68.  Unfortunately, Defendants have returned to their old ways, seeking to \nconstruct a curtain around their activities and concealing information from the \npublic and from prisoners that they have a right to know.  Plaintiffs have no \nadequate remedy at law.  \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \n69.    Based  on  the  facts  set  forth  above,  Plaintiff  Miller  claims  that \nDefendants Grubbe, Prindle, Goodman, and Murphy violated rights secured to \nhim by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.  Relief is \nsought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. \n \n \n  20\n\nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n70.  Based on the facts set forth above, Plaintiff Miller, on his own behalf \nand on behalf of the plaintiff class, claims that Defendant Murphy has redacted, \nand has a policy of redacting, information contained in non-confidential prison \ndocuments requested by prisoners that the law does not permit him to redact.  By \ncensoring this information, Defendant Murphy has violated and is violating rights \nsecured  to  plaintiffs  by  the  First  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  to  the  U.S. \nConstitution and by Wyoming constitutional and statutory law.  Relief is sought \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, and under Wyoming constitutional and statutory \nlaw.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that this Honorable Court will: \n1.    Issue  declaratory  relief  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  ยงยง  2201  and  2202, \ndeclaring  that  Defendants  violated  Plaintiff  Miller's  rights  under  the  First  and \nFourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. \n2.    Issue  declaratory  relief  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  ยงยง  2201  and  2202, \ndeclaring that Defendant Murphy has violated rights secured to members of the \nPlaintiff class by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution \nand by Wyoming constitutional and statutory law. \n3.  Issue injunctive relief pursuant to Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure on behalf of Plaintiff Miller enjoining Defendants from (a) any further \nretaliation against him, (b) failing to afford him a fair hearing on his disciplinary \n  21\n\ncharges, (c) failing to dismiss disciplinary charges that lack foundation or are \ndiscriminatory and retaliatory, and (d) failing to expunge all references in his \nprison  file  to  the  disciplinary  charges  at  issue  herein  and  to  restore  the \nclassification he would have had but for his conviction on those charges. \n4.  Issue injunctive relief pursuant to Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure  on  behalf  of  the  Plaintiff  class  enjoining  Defendant  Murphy  from \nredacting  information  contained  in  non-confidential  prison  documents  beyond \nwhat Wyoming and federal law allows.  \n5.    Grant  Plaintiff  Miller  the  total  sum  of  $10,000  in  compensatory \ndamages and grant punitive damages to Mr. Miller from each defendant in the \namount of $10,000.    \n6.  Grant such additional and further relief as the Court may deem proper \nunder  the  circumstances,  including  an  award  of  attorneys'  fees  and  costs \nincurred in this litigation. \n \n            _____________________________ \n            Stephen L.
