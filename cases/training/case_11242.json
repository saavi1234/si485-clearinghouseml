    "summary": "<p>On November 12, 2008, the Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center and the National Fair Housing Alliance, along with African-American homeowners from Louisiana, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on behalf of more than 20,000 families, against the U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development (\"HUD\") and the Executive Director of the Louisiana Recovery Authority (\"LRA\") under 42 U.S.C. §§ 3604(a), 3605(a), 3608(d), (e)(5) and 42 U.S.C. § 5304(b)(2). </p><p>The plaintiffs, represented by both private counsel and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, alleged that HUD's \"Road Home\" program has a discriminatory and disparate impact on African Americans. They asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief. Specifically, the plaintiffs sought an injunction requiring the LRA to recalculate Road Home awards to homeowners in New Orleans using a formula that does not have a disparate impact on African Americans.</p><p>In response to the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, HUD established the Road Home program, an $11 billion housing redevelopment program. Road Home was designed to compensate individuals whose homes were damaged by Hurricane Katrina. The Road Home Program was administered by the LRA.  The LRA awarded grants to homeowners based on the <i>lesser</i> of the pre-Katrina value of a home or the cost to rebuild the home. It capped grant amounts at $150,000. A number of covenants, including a covenant to rebuild within a certain amount of time, accompanied the grants. Because home values in predominantly African-American neighborhoods are lower than the values of similar homes in white neighborhoods, Plaintiffs alleged that African-Americans homeowners were likely to receive grant amounts based on the pre-storm value of their homes rather than the cost of rebuilding. On the other hand, Plaintiffs alleged that white homeowners with higher-valued yet similar homes were likely to receive grants based on the cost to rebuild. Plaintiffs alleged this would result in disparate impact, because white homeowners would receive higher grants than African-American homeowners; in turn, the result would be an uneven recovery that harmed African-American residents of Louisiana. For example, one African-American homeowner had a home that the LRA estimated had a pre-storm value of $1,400 but would have cost over $150,000 to rebuild.  According to the formula, she would have received an essentially useless grant of $1,400.</p><p> </p><p>On May 5, 2009, LRA filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs' complaint and also moved to transfer the matter to a district court in Louisiana. Co-defendant HUD opposed the motion. The District Court originally set a hearing on the motion for June 2010, but the hearing was continued. The District Court Judge (Judge Henry Kennedy) did not rule on the motion to dismiss until September 7, 2010, most likely because shortly after the defendants filed motions to dismiss, the plaintiffs filed two motions for temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions, the results of which were appealed to the D.C. Circuit.</p><p>On October 12, 2009, Louisiana provided low- and moderate-income homeowners who had received a Road Home grant based on the pre-storm value of their home with the opportunity to receive Additional Compensation Grants in an effort to provide grantees with grants based on the estimate cost of damage.</p><p>On June 6, 2010, plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction preventing the Louisiana from spending any remaining funds from the Road Home Program until the merits of the plaintiffs' case are resolved. Plaintiffs filed this motion because the LRA was set to sunset on June 30, 2010 and all remaining Road Home funds were scheduled to transfer to Louisiana's Office of Community Development, which would repurpose the funds for another program. On June 29, 2010, the District Court (Judge Henry Kennedy) found the plaintiffs were likely able to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination, but even so denied the plaintiffs' motion. He held that the Eleventh Amendment barred him from providing retroactive relief to African-American homeowners who had already received grants under the formula.</p><p>On July 21, 2010, the plaintiffs filed a narrower motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction requesting only prospective relief. Judge Kennedy granted this motion, and prohibited Louisiana from disbursing funding based on the value of a person's home. </p><p>The plaintiffs filed an interlocutory appeal to the District Court's denial of its first motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction on July 21, 2010. The LRA appealed the District Court's decision to grant the plaintiff's second preliminary injunction.</p><p>On September 7, 2010, Judge Kennedy granted in part and denied in part the LRA's motion to dismiss and denied the LRA's motion to transfer. Judge Kennedy allowed plaintiffs claims against the LRA's executive director under 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a), but limited the claim to prospective relief. He dismissed all other claims against Louisiana. Louisiana appealed, but on December 30, 2010, the D.C. Circuit Court (per curiam) ordered that to the appeal held in abeyance until it resolved the pending appeals on the motions for temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions.</p><p>On April 8, 2011, a D.C. Circuit Court panel (Judge Judith Rogers, Judge Brett Kavanaugh, and Judge Stephen Williams) determined that plaintiffs had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of the case, and affirmed the District Court's denial of the plaintiffs' first motion and reversed the District Court's granting of the plaintiffs' second motion. In an opinion joined by Judge Kavanaugh, Judge Williams wrote that the plaintiffs failed to put forward convincing evidence of disparate impact.</p><p>In July 2011, the parties reached a settlement in the matter. According to the settlement, the October 2009 program providing for additional compensation grants aided the majority of injured African-American homeowners. In addition, Louisiana agreed to reward approximately 1,300 homeowners in four parishes approximately $62 million in additional compensation.  The parties reserved the additional funds for homeowners who received Road Home compensation based on the pre-storm value of their home. In order to qualify for additional funding, the homeowners who received grants based on the pre-storm value of their home must: (1) live in one of the four Louisiana parishes most impacted by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita; (2) have an original grant that was significantly constrained by their homes pre-storm value; (3) have a home in which the pre-storm value was at or below the fifty-fifth percentile of the parish. Further, eligible recipients must have been unable to complete repairs and return to their homes as of May 1, 2011, or must have returned without repairing the property, which must be uninhabitable according to local laws and ordinances. The agreement also provided recipients of this additional grant money additional time to comply with the rebuilding covenants that accompanied their original grants.  </p><p>The plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the suit, in light of the settlement, which does not provide for court enforcement.</p>",

Louisiana granted funds based on the lesser of the home's pre-storm value or the amount it would cost to rebuild the home.

      "text": "SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \nWHEREAS, in November 2008, Plaintiffs Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action \nCenter, National Fair Housing Alliance, Daphne Jones, Edward Randolph, Gloria Burns, Rhonda \nDents, and Almarie Ford (“Plaintiffs”) filed the instant action seeking injunctive and declaratory \nrelief against Defendant U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) and \nagainst Defendant Paul Rainwater, in his official capacity as Executive Director of the Louisiana \nRecovery Authority (“the State”),1 under the Fair Housing Act of 1968 (“FHA”), as amended, 42 \nU.S.C. § 3613, the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 & 2202, 28 U.S.C. § 1331, and \n28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(4) for violations of the FHA and the Housing and Community Development \nAct of 1974.  See Greater New Orleans Fair Hsg. Action Ctr., et al. v. HUD, et al., No. 1:08-\n1938 (D.D.C.), Dkt. No. 1, Compl. ¶¶ 8-9, interlocutory appeals docketed, Nos. 10-5257, 10-\n5269, 10-5309 (D.C. Cir.).  In this action, Plaintiffs sought to ensure that Road Home Program \nOption 1 grant recipients receive grants based on the Estimated Cost of Damage, up to $150,000, \nrather than grants based on Pre-Storm Home Value;  \nWHEREAS, on October 12, 2009, the State adopted Action Plan Amendment No. 39, \nwhich lifted the prior $50,000 cap on Additional Compensation Grants (“ACG”) for low- and \nmoderate-income homeowners under Option 1 of the Road Home Program, as more particularly \ndescribed in that amendment.  As a result, low- and moderate-income homeowners were given \nthe opportunity to receive uncapped ACGs so that eligible homeowners received Road Home \nawards up to the Estimated Cost of Damage to their homes, ensuring that all low- and moderate-\nincome homeowners would receive Option 1 grants based on Estimated Cost of Damage instead \nof Pre-Storm Home Value.  To date, the State has distributed an additional $470 million in \n                                                           \n1 By terms of its enabling statutes, the Louisiana Recovery Authority as an agency ceased to exist, and the functions \nrelating to design of the Road Home Program were subsumed by the Louisiana Division of Administration Office of \nCommunity Development, for which the current interim executive director is Pat Forbes.    \n \n\nuncapped ACG awards to 13,361 low- and moderate-income homeowners by virtue of lifting of \nthe $50,000 cap on ACG awards.  Through the implementation of Action Plan Amendment 39, \nthe majority of the putative Plaintiff class members (African-American homeowners in Orleans \nParish whose initial grants were based on Pre-Storm Value) have received Option 1 grants based \non Estimated Cost of Damage;  \nWHEREAS, on June 13, 2011, the State submitted Action Plan Amendment No. 51 to \nHUD for its acceptance. [Attached hereto as Exhibit A.]  Action Plan Amendment No. 51, the \n“Blight Reduction Grant Adjustment” (BRGA), is a substantial amendment to Option 1 of the \nRoad Home Program.  As described therein, Amendment No. 51 will provide additional \npayments to Option 1 Road Home program participants residing in Cameron, Orleans, \nPlaquemines, and St. Bernard Parishes who: (i) have not been able to repair and re-occupy their \nstorm-damaged homes, (ii) received Road Home Option 1 grant awards that were limited by the \npre-storm value of their homes, and (iii) received  Road Home grant awards that fall below the \n55th percentile of pre-storm value per square foot for homes within their parish. Action Plan \nAmendment 51 further provides that any individual receiving a BRGA shall receive a one (1) \nyear extension in which to comply with the Road Home Covenants; and certain additional \nOption 1 beneficiaries whose grants were limited by pre-storm value but are ineligible for the \nBRGA may also receive a one-year extension upon application to the State through its covenant \nextension program;  \nWHEREAS, the State estimates that Amendment No. 51 will require up to $62 million of \nthe funds remaining from the third and final Congressional appropriation to Louisiana for the \nRoad Home Program.  See Pub. L. No. 110-116, 121 (Nov. 13, 2007). HUD has accepted \nAmendment No. 51, as submitted by the State of Louisiana, on July 6, 2011; and    \n   2 \n\nWHEREAS, through the continued administration of the Road Home Program, the State \nwill make refined projections of the amount, if any, of the funds budgeted for the Road Home \nProgram that will not be consumed by the close out of the Road Home Program, including the \nfunds spent on Amendment No. 51.  The State anticipates utilizing any remaining available funds \nin the restoration of communities impacted by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and will determine \nthe use and method of spending such funds at the time the State has completed its projections.  \nThe use of such funds will be subject to the laws and regulations governing the use of those \nfunds. \nNOW, THEREFORE, \n1. The parties agree that the reference in this Settlement Agreement to any action plan \namendment, whether previously submitted or to be submitted in the future, does not create any \nnew right or cause of action on behalf of the parties hereto or any other party with respect to the \nprograms created or amended in those action plan amendments.   \n2. Within two (2) business days of execution of this Settlement Agreement by all parties, \nplaintiffs will file a notice of dismissal of this action with prejudice pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. \n41(a)(1). \n3. The parties agree that this Settlement Agreement does not represent an admission of \nliability by either Defendant; nor does it represent any admission of the absence of liability by \nthe Plaintiffs.   \n4. The parties agree that each party shall bear its own fees and costs in this action, \nincluding any appeals of this action. \n   3 \n\n5. Nothing contained in this Settlement Agreement shall be deemed to be an approval or \nadoption by any party of any other party’s rationale or justification for entering into this \nSettlement Agreement.   \n6.

No. 1:08-cv-1938-HHK \n \nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING \nAND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \nNOTICE OF DISMISSAL \n \n  NOW COME Plaintiffs, Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center, the National \nFair Housing Alliance, Gloria Burns, Rhonda Dents, Almarie Ford, Daphne Jones, and Edward \nRandolph, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1)(A), and file this Notice of Dismissal of the above-\nstyled action.  Plaintiffs state as follows: \n1.  Plaintiffs filed their Complaint on November 12, 2008,  Dkt. 1., alleging racial \ndiscrimination in the “Road Home” program – the single largest housing recovery program in \nU.S. history – due to the use of pre-storm market value as a criterion to determine grant awards. \n2.  After the Complaint was filed, Defendants U.S. Department of Housing and \nUrban Development (“HUD”) and Robin Keegan, Executive Director of the Louisiana Office of \nCommunity Development1 (“Louisiana”) changed the Road Home program grant formula to \nprovide full relief to over 13,000 low- and moderate-income homeowners, totaling $473 million.  \n                                                           \n1 Robin Keegan was formerly the Executive Director of the Louisiana Recovery Authority and was later named \nExecutive Director of the Office of Community Development (“OCD”), a unit of the Division of Administration in \nthe State of Louisiana and successor agency to the Louisiana Recovery Authority.  On November 19, 2010, Keegan \nleft her position with OCD. Pat Forbes is the interim Executive Director of OCD. \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 101   Filed 07/08/11   Page 2 of 4\nThrough supplemental grants, these individuals received relief tantamount to the full relief they \ncould have received had their initial grants been based upon the estimated cost of damage to their \nhomes, rather than the lower pre-storm market value of their homes. \n3.  After additional settlement negotiations, the parties fully executed a settlement \nagreement to resolve this action on July 7, 2011.  In the settlement agreement, HUD and the \nLouisiana agreed to further amend the Road Home program to (a) offer supplemental rebuilding \ngrants totaling up to $62 million to certain non low- and moderate-income homeowners whose \ninitial grant awards were based upon the pre-storm market value of their homes and who have \nbeen unable to rebuild their homes; and (b) grant up to a one-year extension of the deadline for \nhomeowners to re-occupy their homes.  \n4.  Defendants HUD and Louisiana have neither served an answer nor a motion for \nsummary judgment in this action.   \n5.  By virtue of this Notice, Plaintiffs dismiss their claims against Defendants HUD \nand Keegan with prejudice.2 \nWHEREFORE, in light of the Settlement Agreement reached by all parties, Plaintiffs, \npursuant to Rule 41(a)(1)(A), file this Notice dismissing the instant action without need of \nfurther Order of this Court. \n \nDated:  July 8, 2011           \n \n \n \n \n                                                           \n2 Pursuant to Stipulation by Plaintiffs and HUD, and a subsequent order of this Court, the deadline for class \ncertification was extended until six months after the close of discovery.  See Dkt Nos. 15 and 16.  As the action did \nnot mature to the class certification stage, the Settlement Agreement and Notice of Dismissal are intended to bind \nonly the parties thereto (the named Plaintiffs in this action, Defendant HUD, and Defendant Louisiana), and does not \nwaive, compromise, or extinguish the rights of any absent members of the putative class, including the right to bring \nan action against HUD or Louisiana seeking the same or different relief as the Plaintiffs did in the instant action. \n  2\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 101   Filed 07/08/11   Page 3 of 4\nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n/s/ Damon T.

Assigned To: Kennedy, Henry H. \nAssign. Date: 11/12/2008 \nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF  Description: Civil Rights - Non. Employ. \nHOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, \n451 Seventh Street SW, Washington, D.C., 20410; \nand PAUL RAINWATER, IN HIS OFFICIAL \nCAPACITY AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF \nTHE LOUISIANA RECOVERY AUTHORITY, \n150 Third Street, Suite 200, Baton Rouge, \nLouisiana, 70801; \nDefendants. \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nINTRODUCTORY STATEMENT \nI.  This is a civil rights case brought by fair housing organizations and African \nAmerican homeowners in New Orleans, Louisiana, on behalf of themselves and more than \n20,000 similarly situated families, to redress the harm caused by Defendants' discriminatory \ndesign and operation of the Road Home program, the largest housing redevelopment program in \nUnited States history.  This case is brought to enforce the Fair Housing Act of 1968, as amended \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK     Document 1      Filed 11/12/2008     Page 2 of 18\n(42 U.S.c. § 3601 et seq.), and Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, \nas amended (42 U.S.C. § 5301 et seq.). \n2.  This action arises out of Defendants' design and operation of the Road Home \nprogram, an $11 billion housing redevelopment program that provides grants to homeowners in \nLouisiana who were affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005.  The purpose of the Road \nHome program is to restore communities by helping families rebuild and return to their.homes. \n3.  Road Home grants are calculated using the lower of two baseline values: the pre-\nstorm value of the home, or the cost ofdilmage to the home.  The Road Home formula has a \n\\ \n\\. \ndiscriminatory disparate impact on African American homeowners because home values in \npredominantly African American communities are generally lower than home values for similar \nhomes in predominantly white communities. \n4.  As a result, African American homeowners are more likely to receive Road Home \ngrants based on the pre-storm value of their home than are white homeowners, and African \nAmerican families therefore face larger gaps than white families between the grant amount and \nthe cost to rebuild.  Because of this disparity, an African American family is less likely to be able \nto rebuild its home and remain in its community than a white family with a comparable home \nthat suffered similar damage. \n5.  The Road Home program is funded by the CDBG Disaster Recovery Grant \nprogram, a $19.7 billion Community Development Block Grant program allocated by Congress \nfor necessary expenses related to disaster relief, long-term recovery, and rebuilding expenses in \nthose areas most affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. \n2 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK     Document 1      Filed 11/12/2008     Page 3 of 18\n6.  Defendant United States Department of Housing and Urban Development \nadministers the CDBG Disaster Recovery Grant program.  Defendant Paul Rainwater, Executive \nDirector of the Louisiana Recovery Authority, administers the Road Home program. \n7.  Plaintiffs seek a judgment declaring that Defendants have violated the Fair \nHousing Act of 1968 and Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, and \nan injunction ordering Defendants to recalculate Road Home homeowner grants in a \nnondiscriminatory manner. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n\\ \n\\. \n8.  Jurisdiction is conferred on this Court by 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because this action \narises under the Constitution and laws of the United States; by 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) because \nPlaintiffs seek to redress the deprivation of rights secured by the Constitution and Acts of \nCongress providing for equal rights; by 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(4) because Plaintiffs seek to secure \nequitable and other relief under Acts of Congress protecting civil rights; and by 42 U.S.c. \n§ 3613(a) because Plaintiffs seek relief with respect to discriminatory housing practices in \nviolation of the Fair Housing Act. \n9.  Declaratory and injunctive relief is sought as authorized by 28 U.S.c. §§ 2201 \nand 2202. \n10.  Venue is proper in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia \nunder 28 U.S.C.§§ 1391(b) and 1391(e). \nPARTIES \n11.  Plaintiff Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center, Inc.

NFHA established GNOFHAC in 1995, and GNOFHAC is now a NFHA member \nand receives a variety of training and technical assistance from NFHA.  Following Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita, NFHA raised funds to promote fair housing in the redevelopment and \nreconstruction of New Orleans, and diverted resources to staff that effort. \n13.  Plaintiff Gloria Burns is African American and currently resides temporarily in \nBaton Rouge, Louisiana.  Ms. Burns has lived in New Orleans her entire life, and has owned a \nhome in the St. Roch neighborhood in New Orleans since 1993.

Ms. Ford has lived in New Orleans since 1971, and has owned a home in the New \n4 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK     Document 1      Filed 11/12/2008     Page 5 of 18\nOrleans East neighborhood of New Orleans since 1988.

Plaintiff Edward Randolph is African American and currently resides temporarily \nin Luling, Louisiana.  Mr. Randolph hasliyed in New Orleans his entire life, and has owned a \n\" \n\\, \nhome in the New Orleans East neighborhooc! of New Orleans since 2000.  His home was \ncatastrophically damaged by Hurricane Katrina and the subsequent flooding. \n18.  Defendant United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) \nis a Department of the Executive Branch of the United States Government.  HUD was created by \nCongress pursuant to 42 U.S.c. § 3532.  HUD is responsible for the administration, funding, and \nsupervision offederal low-income housing programs, including the Community Development \nBlock Grant program. \n19.  Defendant Paul Rainwater is the Executive Director of the Louisiana Recovery \nAuthority (LRA).  The LRA is a Louisiana state agency created to coordinate and administer \nprograms and funds from federal, state, local, and private sources for recovery from Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita, including CDBG Disaster Recovery Grant funds.  See La. Rev. Stat. \n§§ 36:4(H), 49:220.1 - 49:220.7. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n20.  The individual Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and all others \nsimilarly situated pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n5 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK     Document 1      Filed 11/12/2008     Page 6 of 18\n/ \n21.  The class consists of all African American homeowners in New Orleans who have \nparticipated in the Road Home program or who will participate by the first day oftrial, whose \ngrant amount was calculated or will be calculated based on the pre-stonn value of their homes, \nand who have selected or will select the program's option of using the funds to repair or rebuild \ntheir homes.  The challenged formula was applied to each member of the proposed class. \n22.  This action is properly maintainable as a class action because the requirements of \nRule 23(a) and Rule 23(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are met. \n23.  The class is so numeroiisthatjoinder of all members is impracticable.  Upon \n\\ \n\" \ninformation and belief, more than 20,000 African American homeowners in New Orleans are \nmembersofthe proposed class. \n24.  The claims alleged on behalf of the named Plaintiffs as class representatives raise \nquestions oflaw or fact common to the class.  These common questions include, but are not \nlimited to, whether the decision to consider the pre-storm value of the home in determining the \ngrant amount has had an adverse impact upon the class; whether the decision to use the pre-storm \nvalue ofthe home can be justified in terms of the program's goals; whether HUD acted lawfully \nin approving the Road Home grant formula; and whether the class may obtain injunctive relief \nand other equitable remedies. \n25.  The claims of the class representatives are typical of the class they seek to \nrepresent. \n26.  The class representatives will fairly and adequately protect the interests of other \nclass members.  Plaintiffs' counsel are experienced in federal court class-action litigation, \nincluding fair housing and civil rights litigation. \n6 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK     Document 1      Filed 11/12/2008     Page 7 of 18\n27.  This action is properly maintainable as a class action under Rule 23(b)(2) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure because the Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds \ngenerally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or \ncorresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole. \n28.  This action is also properly maintainable as a class action under Rule 23(b )(3) of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure because the questions of law and fact common to members \nof the class predominate over questions affecting only individual members and a class action is \nsuperior to other available methods for'the fair and efficient resolution ofthis controversy. \n\\ \n\\, \n'FACTS \nI.  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. \n29.  Hurricane Katrina made landfall in southeast Louisiana on the morning of August \n29,2005.  As the eye of the storm passed over the city of New Orleans, high rainfall amounts \nand the intense storm surge from the Gulf of Mexico and Lake Pontchartrain compromised the \ncity's flood protection levees along canals and other bodies of water.  Within hours, \napproximately 80% ofthe city was flooded, \n30.  Hurricane Rita made landfall near the Texas-Louisiana border on September 24, \n2005, causing additional flooding and damage to the city of New Orleans. \n31.  As a result ofH  urricanes Katrina and Rita, more than half a million New Orleans \nresidents were displaced and more than 53,000 homes in New Orleans were damaged or \ndestroyed.  In total, approximately 71 % of occupied housing units in New Orleans were damaged \nby the storms.  Hurricane Katrina alone caused an estimated $81.2 billion in damage, making it \nthe costliest hurricane in United States history. \n7 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK     Document 1      Filed 11/12/2008     Page 8 of 18\n32.  Many families that left New Orleans because of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita have \nnot yet been able to return; more than three years after the storms,. New Orleans has recovered \nc, \nonly 72% of its pre-Katrina population. \nII.  The CDBG Disaster Recovery Grant program. \n33.  In response to the historic damage caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, \nCo.ngress created the CDBG Disaster Recovery Grant program and funded it through three \nappropriatio.ns statutes.  See Pub. L. No.. 109-148, 119 Stat. 2680, 2779-81 (Dec. 30, 2005) (the \n2005 Act); Pub. L. No.. 109-234, 120 Slat, 418, 472-73 (June 15, 2006) (the 2006 Act); Pub. L. \n\"-\n\\, \nNo. 110-116, 121 Stat. 1295, 1343-44 (Nov: 13, 2007) (the 2007 Act). \n34.  Congress passed the first two appropriations statutes to address disaster relief, \nlong-term recovery, and rebuilding expenses in those areas in the Gulf of Mexico that were most \nimpacted by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005.  See 2005 Act, 119 Stat. at 2779-81 \n(appropriating $11.5 billion to Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, Florida, and Alabama); 2006 Act, \n120 Stat. at 472-73 (appropriating an additional $5.2 billion to the same states). \n35.  Of the total $16.7 billion appropriation in the 2005 and 2006 Acts, HUD allocated \n$10.41 billion to Louisiana for disaster recovery expenses.  See 71 Fed. Reg. 7666, 7666 (Feb. \n13,2006); 71 Fed. Reg. 63,337, 63,338 (Oct. 30, 2006). \n36.  Congress passed the third appropriations statute in 2007, authorizing an additio.nal \n$3 billion for supplemental CDBG grants to Louisiana specifically to cover costs associated with \neligible Road Home claims . .S ee 2007 Act, 121.Stat. at 1343-44.  Louisiana's total disaster. \nrecovery allocation from the three appropriations statutes is $13.41 billion. \n37.  The appropriations statutes creating the CDBG Disaster Recovery Grant program \nadopt the general framework that governs the regular CDBG program, although HUD may waive \n8 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK     Document 1      Filed 11/12/2008     Page 9 of 18\nstandard CDBG requirements - except for those relating to fair housing, nondiscrimination, labor \nstandards, and the environment - when requested by a state.  See 2005 Act, 119 Stat. at 2779-80; \n2006 Act, 120 Stat. at 472-73. \n38.  The appropriations statutes also require each state to submit an action plan in \nadvance ofthe receipt of grant funds that details the state's intended uses of those funds, and to \nsubmit a quarterly report to the Senate and House Committees on Appropriations reporting on all \nawards and uses of funds.  See 119 Stat. at 2780; 120 Stat. at 473. \n39.  Pursuant to these statutorY:r.equirements, the LRA draws down Disaster Recovery \n~ \n\\. \nGrant funds from HUD as the state's plans for the use of those funds are approved. \n40.  The most recent data show that as of June 30, 2008, the LRA has drawn down \napproximately $4.4 billion ofthe $6.2 appropriated to HUD and allocated to the state pursuant to \nthe 2005 Act.  See Second Quarter 2008 Performance Report (First Appropriation), at \nhttp://www.doa.louisiana.gov/cdbgIDRl2ndQuarter0f2008Grantl.htm.As of the same date, the \nLRA had drawn down approximately $3 billion of the $4.21 appropriated to HUD and allocated \nto the state pursuant to the 2006 Act.  See Second Quarter 2008 Performance Report (Second \nAppropriation), at http://www.doa.louisiana.gov/cdbgIDRl2ndQuarter0f2008Grant2.htm. \nIII.  The Road Home program. \n41.  Of the $13.41 billion in CDBG Disaster Recovery Grant funds allocated by HUD \nto Louisiana pursuant to the three appropriations statutes, the state has designated approximately \n$11 billion for housing programs known collectively as the Road Home program. \n42.  With an $11 billion budget, the Road Home program is the largest housing \nrecovery program in United States history.  See The Road Home Program, \"About Us,\" at \nhttp://www.road2Ia.org/about-us. \n9 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK     Document 1      Filed 11/12/2008     Page 10 of 18\n/ \n43.  The Road Home Homeowner Assistance Program offers relief to the \napproximately 150,000 owner-occupied homes that were destroyed or suffered major damage as \na result of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.  Eligible homeowners are those who owned and \noccupied a home in a single-unit or double-unit structure at the time of the hurricanes, registered \nfor FEMA Individual Assistance, and had FEMA categorize their home as destroyed or having \nsuffered major damage. \n44.  The stated purpose of the Road Home program is to rebuild communities in \nLouisiana affected by Hurricanes KatrTl1a.~nd Rita.  See Louisiana Recovery Authority, Action \n\\. \nPlan Amendment 14 (First Allocation) - Rob.d Home Homeowner Compensation Plan 2 (2007); \nLouisiana Recovery Authority, The Road Home Housing Programs, Action Plan Amendment for \nDisaster Recovery Funds 5 (2006). \n45.  Homeowners who receive Road Home grants are given a choice of promising to \nuse the funds to rebuild or repair their homes or of receiving a reduced grant that may be used to \nobtain housing outside oftheir home parish or outside the state of Louisiana. \n46.  The maximum Road Home grant that a homeowner may receive is $150,000. \n47.  Road Home grants are calculated using the lower of two baseline values: the pre-\nstorm value of the home, or the cost of damage to the home. \n48.  Low- and moderate-income families (those whose income is 80% or less of the \narea median income) that intend to remain homeowners in Louisiana may be eligible for an \n\"Additional Compensation Grant\" of up to $50,000, although in no case may the total Road \nHome grant exceed the $150,000 limit. \n49.  The LRA, in consultation with HUD, proposed and developed the Road Home \ngrant formula and the details of the Road Home program. \n10 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK     Document 1      Filed 11/12/2008     Page 11 of 18\n, \n50.  HUD approved the Road Home grant formula and the details of the Road Home \nprogram as a condition of the distribution ofCDBG Disaster Recovery Grant funds. \n51.  The LRA administers the Road Home program subject to ongoing oversight and \ncontinuing approval by HUD. \nIV.  The effect of the Road Home grant formula on African American homeowners and \nthe refusal to adopt less discriminatory alternatives. \n52.  The requirement that Road Home grant awards not exceed the pre-storm value of \nthe home (where pre-storm value is less than the cost of damage) has a discriminatory disparate \nimpact on African Americans living in hist'orically segregated communities. \n\\~, \n53.  Comparable homes have lower values in predominantly African American \ncommunities than in predominantly white communities. \n54.  Census data demonstrate that African American homeowners in New Orleans are \nmore likely than white homeowners in New Orleans to own homes with lower values.  Data from \nthe 2000 census show that nearly 80% of homes owned by African Americans in New Orleans \nwere valued at less than $100,000, while only about 33% of homes owned by white homeowners \nin New Orleans were valued at less than $100,000.  Data from the 2000 census further show that \napproximately 93% of homes owned by African Americans in New Orleans were valued at less \nthan $150,000, compared to 55% of homes owned by white homeowners. \n55.  African Americans whose property received substantial damage and who qualify \nfor Road Home grants are more likely than white applicants to receive a grant that is based on \nthe pre-storm value of their home. \n56.  Because the Road Home formula limits grant awards to the pre-storm value of the \nhome where that amount is less than the cost of damage, African American recipients of Road \n11 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK     Document 1      Filed 11/12/2008     Page 12 of 18\nHome grants are more likely than white grantees to have a gap between their rebuilding \nresources and the cost to rebuild. \n57.  Among all applicants who have a gap between their rebuilding resources and the \ncost to rebuild, the average gap for African American applicants is far larger than the average \ngap for white applicants. \n58.  The Road Home formula design disproportionately burdens African American \nhomeowners and hinders their ability to return to their homes compared to white families. \n59.  The Additional Compeiisation Grant available for certain eligible low- and \n\\  . \nmoderate-income families does not elimina!'t\\ the discriminatory disparities in grant amounts \nbetween African American and white homeowners. \n60.  The discriminatory disparities in the application of the Road Home formula are \nnot justified by legitimate interests of the Defendants, and alternative courses of action are \navailable to accomplish the goals of the program without imposing a disproportionate burden on \nAfrican American homeowners.  In particular, Road Home grants could be calculated based on \nthe cost of damage to the home, which would permit the program to achieve its goal of restoring \ncommunities and permitting homeowners to rebuild their homes. \nV.  Injnry to the individnal Plaintiffs. \n61.  Plaintiff Gloria Burns applied for a Road Home grant to help finance repairs to \nher home, which was heavily damaged by Hurricane Katrina and the subsequent flooding.  Ms. \nBurns has been approved for a Road Home grant of $1 06,500 based on the pre-storm value of \nher home, including the Additional Compensation Grant.  She has been unable to complete \nrepairs to her home because the total amount she received from all sources, including the Road \nHome program, fell short of her home's cost of damage by $89,000.  Had her Road Home grant \n12 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK     Document 1      Filed 11/12/2008     Page 13 of 18\nbeen calculated based on the cost of damage to her home, she would have received a grant of \n$150,000. \n62.  Plaintiff Rhonda Dents applied for a Road Home grant to help finance repairs to \nher home, which was heavily damaged by Hurricane Katrina and the subsequent flooding.  She \nhas been approved for a Road Home grant of$88,534 based on the pre-storm value of her home. \nBecause her Road Home grant fell short of her home's cost of damage by $58,730, she is now \nliving in a modular home of poorer construction quality and smaller size on the same property. \nHad her Road Home grant been calculated based on the cost of damage to her home, she would \n\\ \n\\, \nhave received a grant of$147,264.33. \n63.  Plaintiff Almarie Ford applied for a Road Home grant to help finance repairs to \nher home, which was heavily damaged by Hurricane Katrina and the subsequent flooding.  She \nreceived a Road Home grant of$3,468 based on the pre-storm value of her home.  She has been \nunable to complete repairs to her home because the total amount she received from all sources, \nincluding the Road Home program, fell short of her home's cost of damage by $156,073.  Had \nher Road Home grant been calculated based on the cost of damage to her home, she would have \nreceived a gran!of$150,000. \n64.  Plaintiff Daphne Jones applied for a Road Home grant to help finance repairs to \nher home, which was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina and the subsequent flooding.  She received \na Road Home grant of$61,000 based on the pre-storm value of her home, including the \nAdditional Compensation Grant.  The total rebuilding assistance she received from all sources, \nincluding the Road Home program, fell short of her home's cost of damage by $45,261.65.  She \nhas not been able to complete all needed repairs to her home, and has had to utilize personal \nsavings and volunteer labor to make the home livable.  Had her Road Home grant been \n13 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK     Document 1      Filed 11/12/2008     Page 14 of 18\ncalculated based on the cost of damage to her home, she would have received a grant of \n$106,261.65. \n65.  Plaintiff Edward Randolph applied for a Road Home grant to help finance repairs \nto his home, which was heavily damaged by Hurricane Katrina and the subsequent flooding.  He \nreceived a Road Home grant of$16,649.92 based on the pre-stonn value of his home.  He has \nbeen unable to complete repairs to his home because the total amount he received from all \nsources, including the Road Home program, fell short of his home's cost of damage by \n$173,193.  Had his Road Home grant bee,n calculated based on the cost of damage to his home, \n\\ \nhe would have received a grant of$150,000'), \nVI.  Injury to the organizational Plaintiffs. \n66.  Plaintiffs GNOFHAC and NFHA established a collaborative program known as \nthe Hurricane Relief Project after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.  GNOFHAC and NFHA have \nraised funds from charitable sources to support the Hurricane Relief Project.  NFHA has \nprovided financial and technical support and training to GNOFHAC and others of its members in \nthe Gulf Coast region. \n67.  The goals of the Hurricane Relief Project include increasing residential \nintegration and eliminating residential segregation in New Orleans and other communities in the \nGulfby facilitating rebuilding and promoting a broad range of housing options to past and future \nresidents of the region.  The Hurricane Relief Project also assists hurricane-affected \nhomeowners in negotiating equitable settlements with their mortgage servicers and insurance \ncompanies, to ensure their ability to remain in their homes and their communities. \n68.  Since the Road Home program began operating in the fall of2006, Hurricane \nRelief Project staff have expended a substantial amount of time and resources representing the \n14 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK     Document 1      Filed 11/12/2008     Page 15 of 18\ninterests of homeowners, home seekers, and other parties who need assistance enforcing their \nrights to equal housing.  In the course of this work, Hurricane Relief Project staff have found it \nmore difficult to ensure that homeowners could remain in their homes and in their communities \nbecause of the Road Home program's rule that grants may not exceed the pre-storm value of the \nhome. \n69.  As a result of Defendants' discriminatory policies and practices, as alleged above, \nGNOFHAC has been directly and substantially injured and frustrated in its mission to promote \n,  '.' \nfair housing throughout the greater New .Orleans area by guaranteeing all people equal access to \n\\ \n\\, \nhousing opportunities and by creating and maintaining integrated housing patterns. \n70.  As a result of Defendants' discriminatory policies and practices, as alleged above, \nNFHA has been substantially injured and frustrated in its mission to eradicate housing \ndiscrimination and eliminate segregation in housing, and in its efforts to carry out the programs \nand services that it provides, including but not limited to assisting hurricane-affected \nhomeowners in New Orleans to rebuild their homes and remain in their communities. \n71.  GNOFHAC and NFHA have also been damaged by the Defendants' \ndiscriminatory policies and practices by being forced to devote scarce resources to identifying \nand counteracting Defendants' unlawful housing practices.  GNOFHAC and NFHA have been \nrequired to, among other things, devote time, resources, and money to educating public officials \nin Louisiana, including the Governor and offi<;ials of the Louisiana Recovery Authority; \neducating other public officials as well as HUD regarding the racially discriminatory impact of \nthe Road Home grant formula; and identifying, assisting, and educating local homeowners in \nNew Orleans. \n15 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK     Document 1      Filed 11/12/2008     Page 16 of 18\n72.  Further, as a result of the practices alleged above, GNOFHAC and NFHA will \n. continue to have their resources diverted in the future, and their missions further frustrated, \nbecause of the need to continue to seek non-discriminatory and desegregative measures in the \nNew Orleans area and the need to continue to educate the public about the discriminatory and \nillegal nature of the Road Home program that has the effect oflimiting minorities' ability to \nreturn and rebuild. \n73.  Had GNOFHAC and NFHA not been required by Defendants' discriminatory \ngrant policies and practices to divert their resources and utilize continuing resources to remedy \n\\ \nthe effects of these discriminatory actions, C5NOFHAC and NFHA would have devoted their \nresources to their other activities and services such as expanding equal housing opportunities; \nfurthering the Congressional purpose of eliminating segregated housing patterns throughout the \nUnited States; providing counseling and referral services to the public with respect to housing \ndiscrimination matters; educating the public about housing discrimination laws; promoting racial \nand ethnic integration and furthering compliance with fair housing laws; working with \ncommunity groups to stabilize neighborhoods, through grant and loan programs, counseling, and \neducation; and assisting residents of the Gulf Coast region affected by Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita, including residents of New Orleans, to negotiate mortgage loan modifications and equitable \ninsurance settlements in order to be able to rebuild their homes and remain in their communities. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT ONE:  Violations of the Fair Housing Act of 1968. \n74.  Defendants have, as described above, made unavailable or denied housing to \nAfrican American homeowners because of their race in violation of the Fair HousingAct, 42 \nU.S.C. § 3604(a). \n16 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK     Document 1      Filed 11/12/2008     Page 17 of 18\n75.  Defendants have, as described above, discriminated against African Americans \nbecause of their race in the availability of, and in the terms and conditions of, real estate-related \ntransactions in violation of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.c. § 3605(a). \n76.  Defendants have, as described above, failed to administer housing-related \nprograms and activities in a manner that affirmatively furthers fair housing, in violation of the \nFair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3608(d), (e)(5). \nCOUNT TWO:  Violations of the Honsing and Community Development Act of 1974. \n77.  Defendants have, as described above, failed to administer the Community \nDevelopment Bl ock Grant program in a ma\\n, ner that affirmatively furthers fair housing, in ' \nviolation of Title I ofthe Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, 42 U.S.c. \n§ 5304(b) (2). \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court: \na)  CertifY this action as a class action on behalf ofthe proposed class pursuant to Rules \n23(a) and 23(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; \nb)  Declare that Defendants' acts, practices, policies, and omissions have deprived Plaintiffs \nof their rights under the Fair Housing Act of 1968 and Title I ofthe Housing and \nCommunity Development Act of 1974; \nc)  Order all appropriate injunctive relief as warranted, including but not limited to ordering \nDefendants to cease immediately their violation of Plaintiffs' rights, and to remedy the \ninvidious effects of their violations by recalculating Road Home homeowner grants in a \nnondiscriminatory manner; \n17 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK     Document 1      Filed 11/12/2008     Page 18 of 18\nd)  Order reasonable attorneys' fees and costs to be paid by Defendants pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 2412 and 42 U.S.C. §§ 1988,3613; and \ne)  Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable. \nDated: November 12,2008 \nRespectfully submitted, \n~~~~(~ \nJohn P  on, President  Direct  Jos  .

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT\nPlaintiffs’ attempt to invoke this Court’s jurisdiction to review the “approval” and oversee the \n“oversight” by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) of the Louisiana\nRecovery Authority’s (“LRA”) Road Home compensation and incentive grant program is not\njusticiable.  First, neither the Fair Housing Act (“FHA”), 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq., nor the Housing and\nCommunity Development Act of 1974 (“HCDA”), 42 U.S.C. § 5301 et seq., provide a cause of action\nfor plaintiffs to bring their claims against HUD.  Nor can plaintiffs demonstrate a waiver of sovereign\nimmunity by the United States under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 701\net seq., that is applicable to their claims because suit against defendant Paul Rainwater, Executive\nDirector of the LRA, or the LRA itself, would provide an adequate remedy to their claims pursuant to\n§ 704 of that Act.  \nSecond, plaintiffs fail to satisfy the redress prong of Article III’s standing requirement. \nPlaintiffs’ claimed injuries are that they unable to complete repairs on and return to their homes.  Such\ninjuries are redressable only by the LRA, the only entity capable of implementing the specific changes\nto the homeowners program upon which plaintiffs’ requested relief depends.  Nevertheless, plaintiffs\nseek redress through HUD, but do not challenge the HCDA, the three special appropriations\nauthorizing the disaster recovery CDBG program at issue in this case, or HUD’s regulations\nimplementing the disaster recovery program.  Because these legal restraints governing HUD’s\ninteractions with the LRA will remain in place regardless of the outcome of this suit, the prospect of\nredress is far too speculative.  And because review under the APA would only permit the Court to set\naside HUD’s approval of the LRA’s program, it would not permit the Court to order HUD to compel\nthe specific relief plaintiffs need to redress their injuries.   \nThird, plaintiffs’ challenge to HUD’s approval of the Road Home Program is moot.  HUD has\nfully obligated the first two special appropriations, meaning that the LRA is now in full control of those\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 38    Filed 07/08/09   Page 8 of 38\nfunds.  Moreover, if this Court were to set aside HUD’s approval of the Road Home program, neither\nthe Court, nor HUD, nor the LRA could reach the funds of the third special appropriation because\nCongress has directed that they may be used only for “otherwise uncompensated but eligible claims . . .\nunder the Road Home program.”  Pub. L. No. 110-116.  Further, plaintiffs concede that this Court\ncould not reach the more than $8.2 billion in funds that the LRA has already awarded under the Road\nHome program.  Because the challenge to HUD’s approval is moot, the only live controversy before\nthis Court is plaintiffs’ challenge to HUD’s enforcement failures in its “oversight and continuing\napproval” of the Road Home program.  However, this claimed failure to act would be unreviewable\nunder § 706(1) of the APA as construed in Norton v. So. Utah Wilderness Alliance (“SUWA”), 542\nU.S. 55 (2004).  \nFinally, plaintiffs’ claims against HUD should be dismissed because plaintiffs have failed to\nstate a claim for relief under §§3604(a), 3605(a), 3608(d) or (e)(5) of the FHA, or under § 5304(b)(2)\nof the HCDA.  Plaintiffs have not alleged facts sufficient to sustain any of their claims against HUD. \nMoreover, plaintiffs cannot show that §§ 3604 or 3605 of the FHA apply to HUD’s actions, and they\nhave not alleged a pattern of behavior by HUD that would be reviewable under §§ 3608(d) or (e)(5) of\nthe FHA.\n   Accordingly, this Court should grant HUD’s motion to dismiss.\nII. PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS ARE NOT JUSTICIABLE AGAINST HUD\nA. Neither the FHA Nor the HCDA Provide Plaintiffs With a Private Right of Action\nAgainst HUD, and Plaintiffs Cannot Proceed Against HUD under the APA\nBecause Plaintiffs Have An Adequate Remedy in Suit Directly Against the LRA  \nContrary to plaintiffs’ contention, they cannot avail themselves of the limited waiver of\nsovereign immunity found in 5 U.S.C. § 702.  Pl. Opp’n at 16-19.  Because neither the FHA nor the\nHCDA supply a private right of action against HUD, the only cause of action plaintiffs can invoke to\nproceed against HUD is the APA.  However, the APA’s limited waiver of sovereign immunity does\n- 2 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 38    Filed 07/08/09   Page 9 of 38\nnot apply when an adequate alternate remedy to suit under the APA exists.  5 U.S.C. § 704.  Plaintiffs\nhave alleged no claims against HUD that they have not (or could not have) also alleged against\nRainwater and the LRA.  Thus, the APA’s limited waiver of sovereign immunity does not apply in this\ninstance, and the suit against HUD should be dismissed.  \n1. There is no private right of action against HUD under the FHA or the\nHCDA\nPlaintiffs assert that they may avail themselves of the waiver of sovereign immunity found in 5\nU.S.C. § 702 without proceeding under the APA.  Pl. Opp’n at 37 (citing Schnapper v. Foley, 667 F.2d\n102 (D.C. Cir. 1981)).  However, plaintiffs concede that they can only proceed under alternate statutes\nif those statutes provide for a private right of action against HUD.  Pl. Opp’n at 37 (“because both [the\nFHA] and the HCDA provide Plaintiffs with a direct right of action to challenge HUD’s discriminatory\nconduct, Plaintiffs need not proceed under the APA.”).  The only case plaintiffs cite for the proposition\nthat they may bring claims under alternate statutes using the waiver in 5 U.S.C. § 702 held that, despite\nthis waiver of sovereign immunity, suit against the FCC could not proceed under the Public\nBroadcasting Act because it “provides no private right of action” against that agency.  Schnapper, 667\nF.2d at 107, 116.  In this case, contrary to plaintiffs’ assertions, neither the FHA nor the HCDA\nsupplies the requisite private right of action for plaintiffs to pursue their claims against HUD.\nPlaintiffs cite no precedent for their claim that the private right of action found in § 3613 of the\nFHA allows them to bring this suit against HUD for violations of §§ 3604 or 3605.  Pl. Opp’n at 36-37. \nNor is this surprising as §§ 3604 nor 3605 do not apply to HUD’s challenged actions in this case. \nPlaintiffs cannot sustain their claim that HUD has “otherwise ma[d]e [housing] unavailable,” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 3604(a), because they do not allege, nor could they allege, that HUD “has provided . . . housing []or\nhousing-related services to consumers.”  Jones v. Ofc. of Comptroller of the Currency, 983 F. Supp.\n197, 202 (D.D.C. 1997), aff’d, 1998 WL 315581 (D.C. Cir. 1998).  Accordingly, as in Jones, this Court\n- 3 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 38    Filed 07/08/09   Page 10 of 38\nshould find that HUD “could not have denied housing or made it unavailable to anyone.  The impact of\nalleged discriminatory practices by the institutions [a federal agency] supervises cannot be attributed to\n[the agency] itself.  The [the agency]’s activities thus cannot fall within the strictures of Section 3604.” \nId.  For the same reason, this Court should find that § 3605 does not apply to HUD’s actions here\nbecause plaintiffs have not alleged, nor could they allege, that HUD has “engag[ed] in residential real\nestate-related transactions,” with consumers.  42 U.S.C. § 3605.  Indeed, the HUD action plaintiffs\nchallenge–oversight of a state government’s grant program–is explicitly regulated by § 3608, which\nrequires the Secretary to “administer the programs and activities relating to housing . . . in a manner to\naffirmatively further fair housing.”  Id. at § 3608(e)(5).  Therefore, if, as plaintiffs urge, §§ 3604 and\n3605 are interpreted to apply to HUD’s actions here, such an interpretation would impermissibly render\n§ 3608 superfluous.  See, e.g., NEA v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569, 609 (1998) (“Statutory interpretations that\nrender superfluous other provisions in the same enactment are strongly disfavored.”) (citation omitted). \nMoreover, as demonstrated below, Congress chose not to create a private cause of action to enforce\n§ 3608, and plaintiffs should not be permitted to override this congressional choice by extending\n§§ 3604 and 3605 beyond their boundaries.  Thus, this Court should follow Jones and hold that neither\n§§ 3604 nor 3605 applies to HUD’s supervision of the LRA’s Road Home program, and so the private\nright of action in § 3613 cannot be used to bring this suit against HUD.\nPlaintiffs’ remaining assertions that they have an implied right of action under the FHA and the\nHCDA to pursue violations of §§ 3608(d) or (e)(5) and 5304(b)(2) against HUD are similarly\nunfounded.  In Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275 (2001), the Court held that there is a high bar that\nmust be surmounted before a judge can find an implied right of action within a statute.  Id. at 286. \n“[P]rivate rights of action to enforce federal law must be created by Congress . . . . Statutory intent . . .\nis determinative.  Without it, a cause of action does not exist and courts may not create one, no matter\nhow desirable that might be as a policy matter, or how compatible with the statute.”  Id. at 286-87\n- 4 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 38    Filed 07/08/09   Page 11 of 38\n(emphasis added).  Sandoval thereby clarified that statutory intent was the true lynchpin of the multi-\nfactor “implied private-cause-of-action” inquiry that the Court had earlier articulated in Cort v. Ash,\n422 U.S. 66 (1975).  Plaintiffs ignore this important clarification: in attempting to prove the HCDA\nsupplies an implied right of action against HUD, they review the Cort factors without even mentioning\nSandoval.  Pl. Opp’n at 30-33.  Further, in their parallel discussion concerning an implied right of\naction in the FHA, plaintiffs do not even reference Cort, let alone the more recent Sandoval.  Pl. Opp’n\nat 38.  As neither the FHA nor the HCDA demonstrates the requisite statutory intent to create an\nimplied right of action against HUD, plaintiffs may proceed with claims against HUD, if at all, only\nunder the APA.\nPlaintiffs’ attempt to demonstrate that the FHA supplies an implied right of action against\nHUD is unconvincing.  HUD does not contest that § 3608(d) and (e)(5), unlike §§ 3604 or 3605, apply\nto HUD, but while Congress created a cause of action to enforce other FHA provisions, see, e.g.,\n§ 3613, it did not create a private cause of action to enforce § 3608.  Nor is there any other evidence\nthat Congress intended a private right of action for the enforcement of § 3608.  Jones, 983 F. Supp. at\n203.  For this reason, even prior to the Supreme Court’s holding in Sandoval, “[t]he majority of courts\nthat . . . considered this issue . . . concluded that there is no implied private right of action under\n[§ 3608], and that an aggrieved person . . . must seek relief not under the FHA, but under the APA.” \nId. at 202 (citing NAACP v. HUD, 817 F. 2d 149, 154 (1st Cir. 1987); Latinos Unidos de Chelsea En\nAccion v. HUD, 799 F.2d 774 (1st Cir. 1986); Lee v. Pierce, 698 F. Supp. 332, 334 (D.D.C. 1988)). \nSee also Marinoff v. HUD, 78 F.3d 64 (2nd Cir. 1996), aff’ing 892 F. Supp. 493, 495 (S.D.N.Y 1995)\n(“the FHA provides no express or implied right of action against HUD”); PR Pub. Hsg. Admin. v.\nHUD, 59 F. Supp. 2d 310 (D.P.R 1999) (“In view of [other provisions crafting remedies under the\nFHA], it is unlikely that Congress absentmindedly forgot to mention an intended private action against\nHUD under section 3608(d).”).  But see Young v. Pierce, 544 F. Supp. 1010 (E.D. Tex. 1982) (failing\n- 5 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 38    Filed 07/08/09   Page 12 of 38\nto apply Cort v. Ash factors but finding an implied private right of action to enforce § 3608(e)(5)).  \nSimilarly, while plaintiffs suggest the existence of an implied cause of action under § 5304,\ncourts that have considered the issue have reached exactly the opposite conclusion.  See, e.g., Latinos\nUnidos, 799 F.2d 774, at 795 (“we hold that Congress did not intend to create a private right of action\nunder the HCDA”); Payne v. HUD, 551 F. Supp. 1113 (S.D. Ohio 1982); Nabke v. HUD, 520 F. Supp.\n5 (W.D. Mich 1981); People’s Hsg. Devel. Corp. v. City of Poughkeepsie, 425 F. Supp. 482 (S.D.N.Y.\n1976).  Cf. Montgomery Improvement Ass’n v. HUD, 645 F.2d 291, 295 (5th Cir. 1981) (finding a\nprivate right of action to enforce § 5309, the HCDA’s nondiscrimination provision).  It is again notable\nthat each court reached its conclusion before the Sandoval Court’s holding that “private rights of action\nto enforce federal law must be created by Congress.”  Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 286.  In light of the\nSupreme Court’s holding in Sandoval and the weight of precedent finding no private right of action to\nenforce §§ 3608(d) or (e)(5), 5304(b)(2), this court should find that no private right of action is\navailable against HUD under these statutes.1\n2. The APA waiver of sovereign immunity does not apply to HUD because\nother adequate remedies exist for plaintiffs’ grievances\nPlaintiffs only potential cause of action against HUD would be under the APA, but the limited\nwaiver of sovereign immunity found in § 702 applies only if “there is no other adequate remedy in a\ncourt.”  5 U.S.C. § 704.  HUD’s motion to dismiss demonstrated that plaintiffs’ ability to bring claims\nagainst Rainwater (or the LRA) provides them an adequate remedy.  HUD Mot. to Dismiss at 32-35. \nPlaintiffs allege, however, that remedies against Rainwater are not sufficient because they do not\nredress “HUD’s violation of the unique obligation that it is required to fulfill under federal fair housing\n1  HUD reiterates that it takes no position as to whether the HCDA contains a private right of\naction against Rainwater or the LRA.  Because plaintiffs may vindicate their HCDA claims against the\nstate through other means, HUD Opp’n to Rainwater Mot. to Dismiss at 8-9, the availability of an\nHCDA claim against state defendants does not bear upon the existence of adequate alternate remedies\nthrough which plaintiffs can find relief.  \n- 6 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 38    Filed 07/08/09   Page 13 of 38\nlaw.”  Pl. Opp’n at 40 (emphasis in original).  Yet plaintiffs never articulate what HUD’s unique\nobligation is. \nPlaintiffs fail to allege any discriminatory behavior on the part of HUD that is separate or\ndistinct from the behavior of Rainwater and the LRA.  The entirety of plaintiffs allegations against\nHUD are that: (i) the LRA “proposed and developed” the Road Home program, “in consultation with\nHUD,” (ii) HUD “approved the Road Home grant formula,” and (iii) the LRA administers the Road\nHome program “subject to ongoing oversight and continuing approval of HUD.”  Compl. ¶¶ 49-51.  \nEach of these actions can only be considered discriminatory if, in fact, Rainwater (or the LRA) has\ndiscriminated in the design and implementation of the Road Home Program.  Any remedy that would\nrelieve the alleged harm caused by Rainwater’s actions would therefore be an “adequate remedy” for\nplaintiffs’ claims against HUD.2\nMoreover, plaintiffs concede that D.C. Circuit precedent establishes § 704 as a bar to suit\nagainst a federal agency when the claim is for “fail[ure] to enforce compliance by federal-funding\nrecipients with nondiscrimination requirements.”  Pl. Opp’n at 43 (citing Wash. Legal Found. v.\nAlexander, 984 F.2d 483 (D.C. Cir. 1993), and Women’s Equity Action League v. Cavazos, 906 F.2d\n742 (D.C. Cir. 1990)).  Indeed, the D.C. Circuit has recently reaffirmed that “a plaintiff [can]not\nmaintain an action under the APA directly against a federal agency for failure to investigate and rectify\n2  Further, plaintiffs’ Complaint fails to make any allegation that HUD approved the Road\nHome Program despite actual knowledge – or even constructive knowledge – of its alleged\ndiscriminatory impact.  Compl. passim.  Both the FHA and HUD’s regulations implementing the\ndisaster recovery CDBG program at issue in this case provide ample opportunities for members of the\npublic, including plaintiffs, to comment on the grant programs and to lodge administrative complaints\nwith the LRA and HUD.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 3610;   24 C.F.R. § 6.10 et seq.  Despite these\nopportunities for public involvement, plaintiffs make no allegation that they, or anyone else, put HUD\non notice of the alleged discrimination by filing any comments or complaints about the design of\nLRA’s Road Home program.  Compl. passim.  Nor do they make any allegation that HUD otherwise\nhad constructive notice that the Road Home program might impose a disparate impact.

The Garcia court further emphasized that “a direct action\nagainst a regulated private party [is] an adequate remedy at law for whatever additional injury a\nplaintiff suffer[s] as a result of a federal agency’s failure to remedy that violation administratively.”  Id.\nat 525.  This understanding arises in part from the D.C. Circuit’s reading of Supreme Court precedent\nin Cannon v. Univ. of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677 (1979).  As the court has explained, “Cannon suggests\nthat Congress considered private suits to end discrimination not merely adequate but in fact the proper\nmeans for individuals to enforce Title VI [of the Civil Right Act of 1964, as amended 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000d] and its sister antidiscrimination statutes.”  Women’s Equity, 906 F.2d at 751 (citing Canon,\n441 U.S. at 704).  Thus, because “other remedies are adequate, federal courts will not oversee the\noverseer.”  Coker, 902 F.2d at 89.  \nIn attempting to explain why redress against Rainwater is insufficient in this case, plaintiffs\npoint exclusively to HUD’s oversight role, noting its “expertise and obligation to monitor grant\nrecipients for compliance with civil rights and other program requirements.”  Pl. Opp’n at 41. \nSimilarly, in arguing that their claims against HUD are not moot despite the overwhelming majority of\nthe CDBG funds having already been obligated to the state, plaintiffs suggest that “HUD has the\nauthority to require Rainwater to use the funds that HUD has already disbursed and obligated to LRA.” \nPl. Opp’n at 13.  Thus, by their own concessions, plaintiffs are lodging suit “against a federal agency\nfor failure to investigate and rectify the wrongdoing of a third party,” which is exactly the sort of claim\nthat the D.C. Circuit has foreclosed.  Garcia, 563 F.3d at 524-25.\n- 8 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 38    Filed 07/08/09   Page 15 of 38\nPlaintiffs argue, however, that the suit against HUD should be allowed because several district\ncourts in other circuits have permitted claims against HUD to proceed in suits in which  allegedly\ndiscriminating parties were also defendants.  Pl. Opp’n at 41 (citing Thompson v. HUD, 348 F. Supp.\n2d 398 (D. Md. 2005); Dean v. Martinez, 337 F. Supp. 2d 477 (D. Md. 2004)).  However, Thompson\nitself acknowledged that its holding would be foreclosed if it were bound by D.C. Circuit precedent. \nSee Thompson, 348 F. Supp. 2d at 422 (citing Women’s Equity, supra, 906 F.2d 742, as contrary\nprecedent for the court’s contention that “tenants may present APA claims against HUD for\ndiscrimination grievances”).  Moreover, both Thompson and Dean are distinguishable because\nplaintiffs in those cases alleged injuries against federal defendants that could not be remedied through\nclaims against non-federal parties.  In Thompson, plaintiffs claimed that HUD violated § 3608(e)(5)\nthrough its “failure adequately to consider a regional approach to desegregation of public housing.” \n348 F. Supp. 2d at 408.  Such a claim could not, by its very nature, be brought against the allegedly\ndiscriminating local government: it was HUD’s responsibility, the court opined, to consider a regional\nremedy.  Similarly, in Dean, the plaintiffs challenged HUD’s sale of an apartment building, also a\nclaim that could only be remedied directly by HUD.  Dean, 336 F. Supp. 2d at 487 (finding that APA\nreview is permissible because the suit against HUD “addresse[d] a different harm”).  In the present\ncase, by contrast, plaintiffs allege no distinct claims against HUD that they do not allege against\nRainwater.  Compl. ¶¶ 74-77 (alleging that all defendants have violated §§ 3604, 3605, 3608, and\n5304).  \nPlaintiffs’ analogies to two, out-of-circuit, district court opinions, Henry Horner Mothers Guild\nv. Chi. Hsg. Auth., 824 F. Supp. 808, 819-20 (N.D. Ill. 1993), and Tinsley v. Kemp, 750 F. Supp. 1001,\n1009 (W.D. Mo. 1990), get them nowhere because in both cases a complete remedy was impossible\nwithout new allocations of funds from HUD.  Pl. Opp’n at 42.  The plaintiffs in those cases alleged that\nhousing authorities and HUD allowed residential units to deteriorate to the point that they were\n- 9 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 38    Filed 07/08/09   Page 16 of 38\neffectively illegally demolished.  The claims against HUD were permitted because without HUD\ncooperation and funding, the housing authorities “could not correct alleged problems to any significant\ndegree.”  Tinsley, 750 F. Supp. at 1009 (emphasis added); Henry Horner, 824 F. Supp at 819 (quoting\nsame).  The housing authorities were so constrained in part because HUD provided the annual\noperating subsidies for the housing units, which are “determined by the difference between the housing\nauthorities projected expenses and projected operating income.”  Id. at 811.  Thus, to resolve the\ncomplaints in Tinsley and Henry Horner, HUD would have had to provide new funding for any court-\nordered remedy.  In this regard, these cases are similar to Lattimore v. NW Coop., 1992 WL 118383\n(D.D.C. 1992), a case in which another court in this district permitted claims against HUD to go\nforward because, to bring about the relief plaintiffs sought, private defendants would have to “seek\nreimbursement from HUD.”  Id. at *7.  Here, plaintiffs do not allege that any new funds or\nreimbursements from HUD would be necessary to effectuate their desired remedy.  Compl. passim. \nThus, the analogy to these cases is unpersuasive, and they do not stand in the way of the dismissal of\nHUD from this suit.\nPlaintiffs nevertheless attempt to align their claims with these decisions by contending that “a\ncomplete remedy would require both that Rainwater develop a nondiscriminatory formula, and that\nHUD approve and oversee the administration of the formula.”  Pl. Opp’n at 41.  But if this court orders\nRainwater to develop a new homeowners compensation and incentives program that satisfies the\nrequirements of the CDBG grant program, then HUD would already be obligated to approve and\noversee the administration of that formula.  See, e.g., 24 C.F.R. § 91.500(b) (allowing HUD to\ndisapprove a plan only if it is inconsistent with the purposes of the Act, it is substantially incomplete,\nthe certifications are not acceptable, or if HUD determines that the applicant has not complied with the\nCDBG requirements).  No separate court order would be required.  Cf. Crutchfield v. U.S. Army Corps.\nof Eng’rs, 230 F. Supp. 2d 687, 700 (E.D. Va. 2002) (holding that, because “the Corp is obligated to\n- 10 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 38    Filed 07/08/09   Page 17 of 38\napply all of its regulations in considering the County’s revised permit application . . . whether or not\nthis Court revokes [the] permit,” the court did not have power to order the agency to simply follow the\nlaw).  And plaintiffs certainly have not made any allegation that HUD would flaunt its regulatory\nobligations by refusing to approve or oversee any revised compensation and incentives program. \nCompl. passim.\nThus, while plaintiffs put forth a range of non-precedential and inapposite district court\nopinions in an attempt to cloud the issue, they have not, because they cannot, overcome the clear\nmandate of § 704: the waiver of sovereign immunity in § 702 is available only if “there is no other\nadequate remedy.”  In this case, plaintiffs’ complaint repeatedly emphasizes that the remedy they seek\nis recalculation of the Road Home grant awards.  Such a remedy can only be effectuated by Rainwater\nand the LRA.  Applying § 704 and the D.C. Circuit’s own clearly established precedent prohibiting\nAPA claims against a federal agency when direct suit against a discriminating party is possible, this\ncourt should dismiss plaintiffs’ claims against HUD.  \nB. Plaintiffs Cannot Satisfy the Redress Prong of Article III’s Standing Requirement\nPlaintiffs’ claims against HUD concerning the LRA’s Road Home program are not redressable\nagainst HUD because plaintiffs cannot demonstrate a likelihood that an order “setting aside HUD’s\napproval of the [Road Home program] and requiring HUD to oversee the development of a new,\nnondiscriminatory,” program would likely remedy their claimed injuries.  Pl. Opp’n at 8.\nPlaintiffs do not contest that an “adequate examination” of redressability requires that the court\n“identify the components of [plaintiffs’] alleged harm.”  Freedom Republicans, Inc. v. Fed. Election\nCom’n, 13 F.3d 412, 416 (D.C. Cir. 1994).  Here, the precise harm alleged by the individual plaintiffs\nis that they were “unable to complete repairs” to their homes because the “amount received from . . .\nthe Road Home grants . . . fell short” of their homes’ “cost of damage.”  Compl. ¶ 61 (emphasis\nadded).  See also id. ¶¶ 62-65 (same).  Moreover, the individual plaintiffs allege that “[h]ad [their]\n- 11 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 38    Filed 07/08/09   Page 18 of 38\nRoad Home grant[s] been calculated based on the cost of damage” to their homes, they would have\nreceived grants up to $150,000.  See id. ¶¶ 61-65.  Similarly, the precise harm alleged by organizational\nplaintiffs is that, “because of the Road Home program’s rule that grants may not exceed the pre-storm\nvalue of the home,” they have diverted resources “to ensure that homeowners could remain in their\nhomes” or “rebuild their homes.”  Id. ¶¶ 68, 70 (emphasis added).  Indeed, the only conceivable basis\nto plaintiffs’ allegations that HUD has violated the Fair Housing Act by making housing “unavailable”\nto plaintiffs, that HUD has discriminated“in the terms and conditions of real estate-related\ntransactions,” or that it did not “affirmatively further[] fair housing,” is that plaintiffs did not obtain\ncompensation and incentive grants based on the cost of damage to their homes.  See id. ¶¶ 74-77 (citing\n42 U.S.C. §§ 3604(a), 3605(a), 3608(d), (e)(5), 5304(b)(2)).  Thus, while plaintiffs contend that they\ncan obtain relief merely through the replacement of the Road Home program with any non-\ndiscriminatory alternative, the only remedy that would redress plaintiffs’ alleged harms would be for\nthe LRA to develop a compensation and incentive grant “based on the cost of damage to the home.” \nId. ¶ 60. \nHowever, the prospect of such relief is far too speculative to support standing against HUD. \nPlaintiffs do not challenge the constitutionality of the HCDA or the special appropriations authorizing\nthe disaster recovery CDBG programs.  Compl. passim.  Nor do they challenge HUD’s implementing\nregulations for the regular CDBG program or the disaster recovery CDBG program.  See id.  Thus, the\nlegal regime governing the roles of HUD and the LRA in designing and administering the disaster\nrecovery CDBG programs will remain in place regardless of the outcome of this litigation.  Contrary to\nplaintiffs’ contention that “HUD and the state of Louisiana are jointly responsible for the [Road Home]\nprogram’s implementation,” Pl. Opp’n at 39-40 (emphasis added), this governing regime not only\ngives the LRA, as the CDBG grant recipient, the choice and the duties to design and administer the\ndisaster recovery CDBG programs, but, more to the point, constrains the remedies that this Court could\n- 12 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 38    Filed 07/08/09   Page 19 of 38\norder against HUD.3  Thus, this Court would not be empowered to order HUD to dictate the terms of\nthe LRA’s use of disaster recovery CDBG to remedy plaintiffs’ alleged inability to rebuild their homes. \nContrary to plaintiffs claims, they cannot satisfy the redress requirement simply by obtaining an\norder “vacating” HUD’s approval of the LRA’s program so that they can be afforded “‘the opportunity\nto participate in’” the development of a new program, “‘the results of which might be more favorable to\n[them].’”  Pl. Opp’n at 8 (quoting dicta about the redress standard for procedural rights cases from Am.\nCmty. Bankers v. FDIC, 200 F.3d 822, 828-29 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (emphasis added)).4  Rather, where, as\nhere, a remedy to a plaintiffs’ injuries would depend not only on setting aside the current rule, but on\n3  Congress made clear more than 30 years ago that the purpose of the HCDA is “to expand the\nrole and responsibility of local governments in implementing community development programs,” and\nthat HUD’s “review should be limited in its scope.”  S. Rep. No. 93-693, reprinted in 1974\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 4273, 4324, 4325 (emphasis added).  See also id. at 4318 (purpose of the Act is “to\nexpand State and local responsibility for planning and executing development activities.”) (emphasis\nadded).  Accordingly, the HCDA sets out more than 25 categories of eligible uses of funds by grantees. \n42 U.S.C. § 5305(a).  And the special appropriations providing disaster relief did not upset that\nbalance.  Pub. L. No. 109-148 (providing “[t]hat funds provided under this heading shall be\nadministered through an entity or entities designated by the Governor of each State.”) (emphasis\nadded); id. (providing that “each State shall submit a plan to [HUD] detailing the proposed use of all\nfunds, including criteria for eligibility and how the use of these funds will address long-term recovery\nand restoration of infrastructure.’) (emphasis added); Pub. L. No. 109-234 (same).\nIn turn, HUD regulations provide that “[t]he choice of activities on which block grant funds are\nexpended represents the determination by state and local participants, developed in accordance with\nthe state’s program design and procedures, as to which approach or approaches will best serve these\ninterests.”  24 C.F.R. § 570.482(a) (emphasis added).  The regulations further make the state\n“responsible for the administration of all CDBG funds.”  Id. § 570.489(a)(1) (emphasis added). \nHUD’s role is confined to ensuring that the state’s interpretation of the statutory and regulatory\nrequirements “are not plainly inconsistent with the Act.”  Id. § 570.480(c).  To ensure the state’s role\nremains the primary one, HUD regulations give “maximum feasible deference” to the state’s\ninterpretation of these requirements.  Id. (emphasis added).  Further, HUD may disapprove a state’s\nplan to use CDBG funds only if it is inconsistent with the purposes of the Act, it is substantially\nincomplete, the certifications are not acceptable, or if HUD determines that the applicant has not\ncomplied with the CDBG requirements.  Id. § 91.500(b).  However, as noted in the text, HUD\nregulations provide that “the certifications required therein are satisfactory to [HUD] . . . unless [HUD]\nhas determined pursuant to [HUD’s review and audit functions set out in] § 570.493 that the State has\nnot complied with the requirements of this subpart.”  Id. § 570.485(c) (emphasis added). \n 4  See also id. (citing Motor & Equip. Mfrs. Ass’n v. Nichols, 142 F.3d 449, 457-58 (D.C. Cir.\n1998); Ctr. for Auto Safety v. Nat’l Hwy. Trans. Safety Admin., 793 F.2d 1322, 1334 (D.C. Cir. 1986)).\n- 13 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 38    Filed 07/08/09   Page 20 of 38\nthe selection of a particular course of action based on an  unchallenged legal regime, the D.C. Circuit\nhas held that “a quest for ill-defined ‘better odds’” in hopefully obtaining that result, “is not close to\nwhat is required to satisfy the redressability prong of Article III.”  Nat’l Wrestling Coaches Ass’n v.\nDep’t of Educ., 366 F.3d 930, 939 (D.C. Cir. 2004).  In National Wrestling Coaches, the plaintiffs\nchallenged the federal agency’s policy interpretations of Title IX of the Education Act Amendments of\n1972, see 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq., and its implementing regulations.  Id.  The court held that even if\nthe plaintiffs prevailed in setting aside the policy interpretation, the underlying statute and regulations\nwould still be in place and would still define the grant recipients’ behavior.  Id. at. 940.  Accordingly,\nthe court held that plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that a favorable ruling against the federal agency\nwould alter the grant recipient’s conduct in a way that would redress plaintiffs’ injuries.  Id. at 944.  \nMoreover, in light of the limited nature of plaintiffs’ challenge, plaintiffs’ request that this\nCourt issue an order “requiring HUD to oversee the development of Road Home grants,” Pl. Opp’n at\n8, that actually remedy plaintiffs’ claimed injury would fall well beyond the scope of the Court’s\nauthority in this action.  As demonstrated in HUD’s motion to dismiss and above, supra at 3-6, the only\ncause of action against HUD and the only possible waiver of sovereign immunity by the United States\npotentially available to plaintiffs is found in the APA.  Under the APA, even if the Court were to find\nin favor of plaintiffs, it would be empowered only to set aside the agency’s action, or to order the\nagency to act, and leave to the agency the determination of appropriate action to take; the Court would\nnot be empowered to compel specific remedial or affirmative action, or even to prohibit other future\naction by the agency.  Thus, as the D.C. Circuit has explained, “when a court reviewing agency action\ndetermines that an agency made an error of law, the court’s inquiry is at an end: the case must be\nremanded to the agency for further action consistent with the corrected legal standards.”  Cty. of Los\nAngeles v. Shalala, 192 F.3d 1005, 1011 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (quoting PPG Indus., Inc. v. U.S., 52 F.3d\n363, 365 (D.C. Cir. 1995)).  See also Crutchfield, 230 F. Supp. 2d at 699 (“This limited scope of\n- 14 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 38    Filed 07/08/09   Page 21 of 38\njudicial review [under the APA] bears directly on the issue of redressability.”).  Moreover, the D.C.\nCircuit has held that it is reversible error for a district court to attempt to retain jurisdiction to devise a\nspecific remedy for the agency to follow.  See Cty. of Los Angeles, 192 F.3d at 1011–12.  Thus,\ncontrary to plaintiffs’ contention, it is entirely speculative that an order setting aside HUD’s approval of\nthe LRA’s Road Home program or requiring it to oversee the program would force HUD to force the\nLRA to develop a program that provides plaintiffs with grants based on the cost of damage to their\nhome.5\nAdditionally, there is no basis to plaintiffs’ claim that HUD is a “necessary” party to obtain\nrelief.  Pl. Opp’n at 9.  As demonstrated above, supra, if the Court were to order the LRA to propose a\nrevised program to remedy plaintiffs’ injuries, the existing implementing regulations would require\nHUD to approve it, so long as it was for disaster recovery, “not plainly inconsistent with the Act,” and\notherwise in keeping with the requirements of the CDBG program.  24 C.F.R. § 91.500.  Plaintiffs\nhave made no allegations that HUD would evade these requirements.  Compl. passim.  In such a\n5  Plaintiffs’ cite a number of cases for the proposition that a court can force HUD to use its\npower to impose fair housing conditions on grant recipients.  Pl. Opp’n at 10-11 (citing U.S. v.\nGautreaux, 425 U.S. 284 (1976); NAACP v. HUD, 817 F.2d 149 (1st Cir. 1987); Shannon v. HUD,\n436 F.2d 809 (3d Cir. 1970); NAACP v. Kemp, 721 F. Supp. 361 (D. Mass. 1989)).  However, none of\nthese cases are redress cases, and none advances plaintiffs’ claim.  First, Gautreaux concerned only the\nphysical scope of the remedy that a court could impose once HUD was found to have violated the\nConstitution.  425 U.S. at 296 (“The question presented in this case concerns only the authority of the\nDistrict Court to order HUD to take remedial action outside the city limits of Chicago.  HUD does not\ndispute the Court of Appeals’ determination that it violated the Fifth Amendment.”).  Second, NAACP\nv. HUD found only that HUD’s alleged pattern, as opposed to a single instance (which is all that is\nalleged here), of alleged failure to affirmatively further fair housing, was reviewable under the APA. \n817 F.2d at 158 (expressly distinguishing Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, (1985), and noting that\nHeckler held unreviewable an FDA decision not to investigate a particular alleged violation).  Third,\nShannon stands only for the non-controversial proposition that “[w]hen an administrative decision is\nmade without consideration of relevant factors[,] it must be set aside.”  436 F.2d at 819.  Plaintiffs\nmakes no such allegation against HUD in this case.  Compl. passim.  Finally, NAACP v. Kemp merely\napplied, on remand, the holding of NAACP v. Boston concerning an alleged pattern of a failure by\nHUD to affirmatively further fair housing, which, again, is not an allegation that plaintiffs make here. \n721 F. Supp. at 367.  Moreover, apart from Gatreaux, each of these cases has been called into doubt by\nNorton v. South Utah Wilderness Alliance (“SUWA”), 542 U.S. 55 (2004).  See infra, at 23-26.\n- 15 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 38    Filed 07/08/09   Page 22 of 38\nsituation, plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that their claims are redressable against HUD.  See Crutchfield,\n230 F. Supp. 2d 687.  In Crutchfield, the plaintiffs sought to enjoin the Corps from issuing a Clean\nWater Act permit for a sewer line.  Id. at 689.  The court held that “the Corp is obligated to apply all of\nits regulations in considering the County’s revised permit application . . . whether or not this Court\nrevokes [the] permit.”  Id. at 700.  Accordingly, the court found that plaintiffs’ claim was not\nredressable against the Corps.  Id.  Thus when, as here, a court order would merely require an agency to\ndo that which its own regulations already mandate, the claim cannot properly be considered\nredressable.  \nNone of the cases cited by plaintiffs undermine the conclusion that plaintiffs’ claims are not\nredressable, as none are relevant to the case at hand.  In America’s Community Bankers, plaintiffs\nchallenged a rulemaking that assessed a fee on the plaintiffs’ member banks.  200 F.3d at 828.  The\ncourt held the claim was redresssable because setting the rule aside “would redress the alleged injury by\ngiving Bankers’s members their money back.”  Id.  Similarly, in Motor & Equipment Mfrs. Ass’n, the\nplaintiffs sought to set aside the EPA’s approval of the State of California’s anti-tampering regulations\nin violation the Clean Air Act.  142 F.3d at 457.  The court held that plaintiffs’ claim was redressable\nbecause finding a Clean Air Act violation would make it unlikely that the EPA could re-enact the same\nrule.  Id.  In the present case, by contrast, plaintiffs cannot show that an order setting aside HUD’s\napproval of the LRA’s Road Home program would likely result in the LRA creating a new program\nthat provided compensation and incentive grants to plaintiffs based on the cost of damage to their\nhomes.  In Center for Auto Safety, the plaintiffs claimed the agency’s rule lowering fuel-efficiency\nstandards for certain model years of vehicles violated the Energy, Policy, and Conservation Act and\nlowered plaintiffs’ options for purchasing fuel-efficient vehicles.  793 F.2d at 1323.  The court found\nplaintiffs’ claims redressable because the agency could make use of the statute’s system of penalties\nand credits to force the vehicle manufacturers to make improvements in the future if they failed to\n- 16 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 38    Filed 07/08/09   Page 23 of 38\nmake them in the present.  Id. at 1334.  Unlike the present dispute, however, in none of these cases did\nthe remedy to the plaintiffs’ injuries depend on the replacement of a challenged rule with a particular\nnew rule that would require a specific outcome.6  Cf. Am. Cmty. Bankers, 200 F.3d at 828-29; Motor &\nEquip. Mfrs. Assn’n, 142 F.3d at 457-58; Ctr. for Auto Safety Hwy. v. Nat’l Hwy. Safety Traffic Admin.,\n793 F.2d at 1334.  \n  Plaintiffs’ attempt to distinguish Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737 (1984); Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare\nRts. Org., 426 U.S. 256 (1976); Linda R.S. v. Richard D., 410 U.S. 614 (1973), and myriad circuit\ncourt cases applying the redress standard is similarly unavailing.  Pl. Opp’n at 9.  Plaintiffs claim that\nthe sole basis for finding that plaintiffs in those cases could not establish the redress-prong of Article\nIII’s standing requirement was the fact that the claimed harms arose from “third parties not before the\ncourt.”  Id.  However, the Ninth Circuit’s application of this line of cases in Rubin v. City of Santa\nMonica, 308 F.3d 1008 (9th Cir. 2002), demonstrates the lack of merit in plaintiffs’ claim.  In Rubin,\nplaintiff brought suit against both the California Secretary of State and the City of Santa Monica\nchallenging the city’s interpretation of the state’s election regulations.  Id. at 1011-12.  The Ninth\nCircuit affirmed the district court’s dismissal of the California Secretary of State, holding that plaintiff\ncould not establish that “enjoining the Secretary of State from enforcing the election regulations would\nstop the City of Santa Monica from following them.”  Id. at 1019.  Similarly, in National Wrestling\nCoaches, supra, the D.C. Circuit focused its inquiry not on the fact that the third parties were not\nbefore the court, but on the fact that even if plaintiffs prevailed on the merits in their challenge to the\nfederal agency decision at issue in the litigation, the underlying statute and regulations “would still be\nin place,” and under that statute and regulations, neither the federally funded entities, nor the federal\n6  For the same reason, plaintiffs’ reliance on Action Alliance of Senior Citizens of Greater\nPhila. (“AASC”) v. Heckler, 789 F.2d 931 (D.C. Cir. 1986), see Pl. Opp’n at 20, is also without merit. \nThe plaintiffs in AASC simply sought an order vacating the agency’s rule, and did not require a\nparticular outcome to redress their injuries.  See 789 F.2d at 938.  \n- 17 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 38    Filed 07/08/09   Page 24 of 38\nagency, would be required to provide any remedy to plaintiffs’ claimed injuries.  366 F.3d at 939-40. \nThe same is true in the present dispute.\nSimilarly unpersuasive is plaintiffs’ reliance on the “unequal footing” line of cases.  Pl. Opp’n\nat 12 (citing CC Distribs., Inc. v. U.S., 883 F.2d 146 (D.C. Cir. 1989); W Va. Ass’n of Cmty. Health\nCtrs. v. Heckler, 734 F.2d 1570 (D.C. Cir. 1984)).  Under the holdings of these decisions, when a\nplaintiff challenges a competitive process, such as contract bidding, on the grounds that discrimination\nin the process prevents the plaintiff from competing on equal footing, the plaintiff need not\ndemonstrate that, but for the discrimination, he would have won the contract.  Rather, because the harm\nto the plaintiff is the exclusion from the initial decision process, mere inclusion in the new process is\nsufficient redress.  See CC Distribs., Inc., 883 F.3d at 151.  But these “unequal footing” cases are\ninapposite here.  Cf. National Wrestling Coaches Ass’n, 366 F.3d at 944.  Plaintiffs are not alleging an\nunequal ability to participate in the initial grant formula development process, and so they cannot claim\nthat a mere opportunity to participate in the development of the new process is sufficient redress. \nRather, they allege a disparate impact in the LRA’s administration of its Road Home program, and the\nonly remedy that would redress their claimed injuries is not, as plaintiffs’ unconvincingly and belatedly\nsuggest in their opposition, the chance that the LRA might come up with a new program, Pl. Opp’n at\n11, but rather that the LRA specifically creates a program that provides a compensation grant “based on\nthe cost of damage” to their homes.  Compl. ¶ 60; see also id. ¶¶ 61-65, 68, 70.\nIn an effort to disclaim the overly speculative nature of the relief sought, plaintiffs suggest that\nthey would be satisfied with any “nondiscriminatory” assistance program.  Pl. Opp’n at 11.  However,\nplaintiffs cannot maintain standing to pursue their claims against HUD by seeking anything less than a\nremedy to their claimed injuries.  See Steel Co. v. Citizens Concerned for a Better Envt., 523 U.S.\n83,107 (1998) (“Relief that does not remedy the injury suffered cannot bootstrap a plaintiff into federal\ncourt; that is the very essence of the redressability requirement.”).  Rather, such a request would not be\n- 18 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 38    Filed 07/08/09   Page 25 of 38\nsufficiently targeted to remedy the plaintiffs’ personal injuries.  See James v. City of Dallas, Tex., 254\nF.3d 551, 568 (5th Cir. 2001).  In James, plaintiffs alleged that they were injured because the City of\nDallas and HUD had engaged in a practice of housing demolition in their neighborhood without proper\nnotice that was allegedly racially discriminatory.  Id. at 565.  As in the suit at hand, plaintiffs requested\nthat HUD be ordered “to remedy ‘the loss of housing . . . as well as the resulting blight.’”  Id. at 568\n(citation omitted).  The court held plaintiffs could not meet the redress prong because of “the\nnarrowness of the named [p]laintiffs’ claimed . . . [notice] injury, and the broad relief requested that\ndoes not address the particular injury suffered by these . . . [p]laintiffs.”  Id. at 567.  The Fifth Circuit\nfound this claim amounted to nothing more than “‘a generalized grievance shared in substantially equal\nmeasure by all or most citizens,’” and, as such, “c[ould ]not provide standing to request injunctive\nrelief.”  Id. at 568 (quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499 (1975)).  As in James plaintiffs, if\nplaintiffs’ request here is read to seek anything less than a remedy to their claimed injuries, and is\nconstrued instead solely as a request to eliminate racial disparities in the administration of the LRA’s\ndisaster recovery CDBG program, it would become nothing more than a generalized grievance, which\nis insufficient to confer standing.  See Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 107.  See also Schlesinger v. Reservists\nComm. to Stop the War, 418 U.S. 208, 220 (1974) (“standing to sue may not be predicated upon an\ninterest of the kind alleged here which is held in common by all members of the public, because of the\nnecessarily abstract nature of the injury all citizens share.”).\nC. HUD’s Approval of Louisiana’s Road Home Program is Moot\nPlaintiffs challenge to HUD’s approval of the LRA’s Road Home compensation and incentive\nprogram is moot, and the only live part of this controversy concerns HUD’s alleged “continued\napproval and oversight” of the state’s disaster recovery program.  \nFirst, City of Houston, Tex. v. HUD, 24 F.3d 1421 (D.C. Cir. 1994), disposes of plaintiffs’\nchallenge to HUD’s approval of Louisiana’s Road Home program because HUD has fully obligated the\n- 19 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 38    Filed 07/08/09   Page 26 of 38\ndisaster recovery CDBG funds provided by the first and second special appropriations at issue in this\ncase.  HUD has fully obligated the $6,210,000,000 that HUD allocated to Louisiana pursuant to Pub. L.\nNo. 109-148.  See 71 Fed. Reg. 7666, 7666 (Feb. 13, 2006); Decl. of Jessie Kome in Support of\nHUD’s Mot. to Dismiss (“Kome Decl.”) ¶ 25 (noting that as of March 6, 2009, HUD has obligated\n$12,400,000,000 to Louisiana).  Similarly, HUD has fully obligated the $4,200,000,000 allocated to\nLouisiana pursuant to Pub. L. No. 109-234.  See 71 Fed. Reg. 63337, 63337 (Oct. 30, 2006); Kome\nDecl. ¶ 25.  Accordingly, resolution of plaintiffs’ challenge to the first two special appropriations is\ncontrolled by the D.C. Circuit’s “unequivocal[]” holding that “once the relevant funds have been\nobligated, a court cannot reach them in order to award relief.”  City of Houston, 24 F.3d at 1426.\nContrary to plaintiffs’ claims, Pl. Opp’n at 12-14, the principles of City of Houston are fully\napplicable in regard to the obligated funds in this case: the obligated funds are no longer available to\nredress plaintiffs claims because they have already been distributed or allocated elsewhere.  Cf. City of\nHouston, 24 F.3d at 1425 (noting that HUD allocated the funds at issue “to hundreds of other cities\nacross the nation”).  Plaintiffs challenge Option 1 of the Road Home program, but this is not the only\napproved Hurricane Katrina disaster recovery CDBG program administered by the LRA for which\nHUD has obligated funds.  The LRA also administers infrastructure, economic development, and other\nhousing programs, including Small Rental Property, Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Piggyback,\nSupportive Housing, and First Time Home Buyer programs, among others.  See HUD Mot. to Dismiss\nat 14.  HUD has fully obligated funds to each of these programs from the first two appropriations, and\nthe state has made significant expenditures in administering them.  See Disaster CDBG Program\nAppropriations, Allocations and Expenditures - May 2009 (available at:\nwww.doa.louisiana.gov/cdbg/drreports.htm).  And while there are significant balances in several of the\nprograms to date, the state still has major obligations it must pay for, such as reimbursing the State\nLand Trust for the more than 9,200 properties acquired under Options 2 and 3 of the Road Home\n- 20 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 38    Filed 07/08/09   Page 27 of 38\nprogram, as well as significant compliance and assurance programs.  See Road Home Updates 2009\n(available at: www.doa.louisiana.gov/cdbg/drreports.htm).  Thus, the funds from the first two special\nappropriations are obligated and unavailable to HUD to satisfy plaintiffs’ claims.\nCiting two cases from outside this Circuit, plaintiffs claim that City of Houston should not\ncontrol in this case.  Pl. Opp’n at 12-14 (citing Davis v. HUD, 627 F.2d 942 (9th Cir. 1980), and\nNAACP, Boston Ch. v. Kemp, 721 F. Supp. 361 (D. Mass. 1989)).  Neither the facts of Davis nor Kemp\nare like those at issue here.  In Davis, the plaintiffs challenged a community’s failure to meet the\nrequirements of its annual housing assistance plan.  627 F.2d at 943.  The court held that the case was\nnot moot because HUD regulations applicable to the community’s grant expressly provided that “the\ncommunity’s failure to meet past obligations could result in conditioning of ‘approval of a succeeding\nyear’s application.’”  Id. at 945 (quoting 24 C.F.R. §§ 570.909(e)(2), (f)(2), 570.910(b)(9), & (b)(10))\n(emphasis added).  Plaintiffs cannot dispute that the funds at issue in this case are the product of special\nappropriations and that, absent additional congressional action, there will be no further appropriations.  \nIn Kemp, moreover, the court expressly distinguished the situation it faced from the issue before this\nCourt, finding that “this is not a case involving a single improper funding decision, for which there is\nno longer a viable remedy.”  721 F. Supp. at 367 (emphasis added) (citing SE Lake View Neighbors v.\nHUD, 685 F.2d 1027 (7th Cir. 1982)).  Thus, Kemp, by its own terms does not apply to this case. \nAccordingly, City of Houston, rather than Davis and Kemp, control resolution of plaintiffs’ challenge to\nHUD’s approval of Louisiana’s use of the funds from the first two appropriations.  \nFurther, if this Court were to set aside HUD’s approval of the LRA’s Road Home program,\nneither this Court, nor HUD nor the LRA, could reach the funds from the third special appropriation. \nThe third special appropriation expressly provided an additional $3,000,000,000 solely for the LRA’s\nRoad Home program.  Pub. L. No. 110-116 (appropriating “$3,000,000,000 for [HUD] . . . to enable\n[it] to make . . . grants to the State of Louisiana solely for the purpose of covering costs associated with\n- 21 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 38    Filed 07/08/09   Page 28 of 38\notherwise uncompensated but eligible claims that were filed on or before July 31, 2007, under the Road\nHome program administered by the State in accordance with plans approved by the Secretary.”). \nBecause Congress has specifically directed that these funds only be used for the Road Home program,\nif the Court were to set aside HUD’s approval of the program, the funds could not be used for any other\npurpose. \nLikewise, and contrary to plaintiffs’ assertion that “no part of this action is moot,” Pl. Opp’n at\n12, plaintiffs themselves effectively concede that part of their challenge is moot.  Plaintiffs admit that\nthe Court would not be empowered to order the return of the disaster recovery CDBG funds already\n“awarded to particular homeowners” to date.  Pl. Opp’n at 13.  To date, funds already “awarded to\nparticular homeowners” represent more than $7.95 billion.  See www.road2la.org/newsroom/stats.htm. \nIn light of their concession that the Court would not be empowered to seek return of these funds,\nplaintiffs effectively admit that is too late to maintain their challenge to HUD’s approval of Louisiana’s\nRoad Home program.  In addition, the program itself is nearing completion.  See\nwww.road2la.org/homeowner/default.htm (indicating that the last day to apply to the Road Home\nprogram was July 31, 2007, and the last day to complete an initial appointment to review the\napplication was December 15, 2007); www.road2la.org/newsroom/stats.htm (indicating that, as of June\n23, 2009, the LRA has considered 151,695 applicants, and has completed processing for 131,831 for a\ntotal of $8.2 billion).  Therefore, plaintiffs’ challenge to HUD’s approval of Louisiana’s Road Home\nprogram is almost identical to the situation in SE Lake View Neighbors v. HUD, 685 F.2d 1027 (7th\nCir. 1982).  In that case, the Seventh Circuit held that plaintiffs could not enjoin federal funding of a\ndisputed project because the project at issue was so far along that the relief requested by plaintiffs had\nbecome “valueless at this late stage of the proceedings.”  685 F.2d at 1037.  Similarly, the Road Home\nprogram is so far along that it is no longer practical to set it aside and return the funds to HUD, even if\nthe Court could reach the already obligated funds. \n- 22 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 38    Filed 07/08/09   Page 29 of 38\nIn light of the Court’s inability to reach the first and second appropriations, and because\nCongress specifically directed that funds in the third appropriation be used only for the Road Home\nprogram, it would be “impossible for the court to grant ‘any effectual relief,’” for plaintiffs’ challenge\nto HUD’s approval of Louisiana’s Road Home Program.  City of Erie v. Pap’s A.M., 529 U.S. 277, 287\n(2000) (citation omitted).  Thus, “any opinion as to the legality of the challenged action would be\n[impermissibly] advisory.”  Id.  For this reason, plaintiffs’ challenge to HUD’s approval of the Road\nHome program is moot, and, the only live controversy before this Court concerns HUD’s “continuing\napproval and oversight” of Louisiana’s Road Home Program.  Compl. ¶ 51.\nD. Plaintiffs’ Claims Under 42 U.S.C. §§ 3608(d), (e)5), 5304(b)(2) Are Unreviewable\nPlaintiffs’ remaining claim concerning HUD’s “continuing approval and oversight” of\nLouisiana’s Road Home Program, Compl. ¶ 51, is unreviewable under § 706(1) of the APA because it\nis exactly the sort of vague agency action the Supreme Court held unreviewable in Norton v. So. Utah\nWilderness Alliance (“SUWA”), 542 U.S. 55 (2004). \nContrary to plaintiffs’ contention, HUD does not claim that SUWA would–if plaintiffs’ were\neven proceeding under the APA–bar review under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2) of plaintiffs’ allegations that\nHUD’s initial approval of the Road Home program violated 42 U.S.C. §§ 3608(d), (e)(5) and\n5304(b)(2).  Rather, as demonstrated in HUD’s motion to dismiss and above, supra, plaintiffs’ claim\nthat HUD violated these provisions is unreviewable for two other reasons.  First, plaintiffs lack\nstanding to challenge, among other things, HUD’s approval of the Road Home program and, second,\ntheir challenge to HUD’s approval is moot. \nHaving established that HUD’s approval of the Road Home program is not reviewable for\nother reasons, HUD’s motion to dismiss demonstrated that this Court would not be able to review\nplaintiffs’ remaining claim that HUD’s “continuing oversight and approval,” Compl.¶ 51, violates\n§§ 3608(d), (e)(5) and 5304(b)(2) under § 706(1) of the APA.  HUD’s alleged failure in “ongoing\n- 23 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 38    Filed 07/08/09   Page 30 of 38\noversight and continuing approval” could not, as plaintiffs suggest, constitute final agency action\nreviewable under § 706(2).  Rather, such a claim could not reasonably be construed as anything other\nthan an alleged “failure to act,” which is reviewable only under § 706(1).  Accordingly, plaintiffs’\n§§ 3608(d), (e)(5) and 5304(b)(2) claims should be dismissed because of the Supreme Court’s\ncontrolling precedent in SUWA.  \nPlaintiffs’ effort to distinguish §§ 3608(d), (e)(5) and 5304(b)(2) from the statute at issue in\nSUWA is without merit, because the statutes are demonstrably similar in their lack of specificity, the\nprecise attribute that the Court found determinative in SUWA.  In the statute at issue in SUWA,\nCongress had declared that the policy of the United States is that “the public lands be managed in a\nmanner that will protect the quality of scientific, scenic, historical, ecological, environmental, air and\natmospheric, water resource, and archeological values” and “that, where appropriate, will preserve and\nprotect certain public lands in their natural condition.”  43 U.S.C. § 1701(a)(8).  The policies of the\nFHA are at least as non-specific.  Cf. 42 U.S.C. § 3601 (declaring that “[i]t is the policy of the United\nStates to provide . . . fair housing throughout the United States.”).  Likewise, the specific statutory\nprovision allegedly violated in SUWA provided that “the Secretary shall continue to manage such lands\naccording to his authority under this Act and other applicable law in a manner so as not to impair the\nsuitability of such areas for preservation as wilderness.”  43 U.S.C. § 1782(c).  Again, §§ 3608(d),\n(e)(5) and 5304(b)(2) are at least as non-specific.  Cf. 42 U.S.C. § 3608(d) (“All executive departments\nand agencies shall administer their programs and activities relating to housing and urban development .\n. . in a manner affirmatively to further the purposes of this subchapter.”); id. §  3608(e)(5) (requiring\nHUD to “administer the programs and activities relating to housing and urban development in a\nmanner affirmatively to further the policies of this subchapter.”); id. §  5304(b)(2) (providing that “any\ngrant shall be made only if the grantee certifies to the satisfaction of [HUD] that . . . the grant will be\nconducted and administered in conformity with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Fair Housing Act,\n- 24 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 38    Filed 07/08/09   Page 31 of 38\nand the grantee will affirmatively further fair housing.”).  Thus, plaintiffs cannot convincingly\ndistinguish the statute at issue in SUWA from that at issue here.\nMoreover, none of the cases cited by plaintiffs advance their claims that HUD’s alleged\nviolations of §§ 3608(d), (e)(5) and 5304(b)(2) are reviewable even without consideration of SUWA.  In\nNAACP v. HUD, 817 F.2d 149 (1st Cir. 1987), the court addressed HUD’s “pattern . . . over time” of\ngrant activity in Boston.  Id. at 157.  In such a situation, the court held that it “can compel an official to\nexercise his discretion where he has obviously failed or refused to do so.”  817 F.2d at 160 (citing\nMastrapasqua v. Shaughnessy, 180 F.2d 999, 1002 (2d Cir.1950)).  But plaintiffs here make no such\nallegation of a “pattern” of violations against HUD.  Compl. passim.  Indeed, the NAACP court\nexpressly distinguished the situation before it from that in Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, (1985),\nwhere, as here, the plaintiffs challenged a single instance of a failure to act, and the Supreme Court\nfound such a failure unreviewable.  Id. at 838.  \nPlaintiffs also fail to acknowledge that Darst-Webbe Tenant Ass’n Bd. v. St. Louis Hsg. Auth.,\n417 F.3d 898, 909 (8th Cir. 2005), is sui generis and therefore does not have persuasive value.  As\nHUD’s motion to dismiss demonstrated, the Darst-Webbe panel merely addressed its earlier order\n(which pre-dated SUWA) that the district court, on remand, determine whether HUD had assessed\n“‘those aspects of its proposed course of action that would further limit the supply of genuinely open\nhousing and . . . assess[ed] those aspects of [the] proposed course of action that would increase that\nsupply.’”  Id. at 907 (citation omitted).  In so doing, the court found that its standard of review was\nmerely “to assess whether HUD exercised its broad authority in a manner that demonstrates\nconsideration of, and an effort to achieve, [fair housing opportunities].”  Id.  Again, to the extent Darst-\nWebbe is in any way inconsistent with SUWA, this Court should simply disregard the decision. \nHowever, even if this Court found Darst-Webbe persuasive, that court’s holding does not advance\nplaintiffs’ claim here, as plaintiffs do not allege that HUD failed to consider, or to make an effort to\n- 25 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 38    Filed 07/08/09   Page 32 of 38\nachieve, fair housing.  Compl. passim.  \nFinally, Thompson v. HUD, 2006 WL 581260 (D. Md.), addressed the scope of the Court’s\nremedial powers after finding a constitutional violation.  Plaintiffs do not allege any intentional\ndiscrimination here.  Compl. passim.  In any event, the court did not review the Thompson plaintiffs’\nclaims under § 706(1), but only under § 706(2).  See id., at * 4.  Thus, plaintiffs’ efforts to use\ninapposite precedent to distinguish the case at hand from SUWA are unavailing.  Accordingly,\nplaintiffs’ claims are unreviewable under § 706(1).   \nIII.  PLAINTIFFS HAVE FAILED TO STATE A CLAIM UPON WHICH RELIEF CAN\nBE GRANTED\nPlaintiffs fail to allege a claim upon which relief can be granted.  HUD Mot. to Dismiss at 40-\n44.  As plaintiffs concede, a complaint must “‘raise a right to relief above the speculative level.’”  Pl.\nOpp’n at 51 (quoting Bell Atlantic v. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (2007)).  None of plaintiffs’ claims\nmeet this requirement, however.  Plaintiffs have failed to allege a claim under §§ 3604, 3605 and 3608\nbecause they have not alleged that the Road Home Program, in its entirety, has a disparate impact on\nthe African American community.  Moreover, plaintiffs offer no cases in support of their contention\nthat §§ 3604 and 3605 can be applied to HUD’s actions in this case.  Similarly, plaintiffs have failed to\nallege that a single failure to administer a housing related program in furtherance of fair housing can\nconstitute a violation of § 3608’s mandate that HUD “administer [its] programs and activities . . . in a\nmanner affirmatively to further” fair housing.  Finally, plaintiffs have conceded that they have failed to\nallege the elements of a violation under § 5304(b)(2) against HUD.  Pl. Opp’n passim. \nA.  Plaintiffs Have Failed to State a Claim Under 42 U.S.C. §§ 3604, 3605 and 3608\nAgainst HUD\nAs plaintiffs note, the Supreme Court recently held that “[t]o survive a motion to dismiss, a\ncomplaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is\nplausible on its face.’”  Pl. Opp’n at 53 (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009)\n- 26 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 38    Filed 07/08/09   Page 33 of 38\n(quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  Plaintiffs’ claim of disparate\nimpact discrimination under §§ 3604, 3605, and 3608 against HUD fails to meet this standard.  First,\nplaintiffs cannot meet the requirement, which the court set out in Iqbal, that a complaint contain\nsufficient facts to “draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct\nalleged.”  Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949.  Plaintiffs’ complaint alleges that a funding formula that constitutes\none part of the Road Home program has caused a disproportionate impact on African Americans, but it\nis an uncontested fact that the LRA and not HUD developed this formula – a point plaintiffs attempt to\nobscure by referring to it as “HUD’s formula” in the defense of their claim against HUD.  Pl. Opp’n at\n54.  In explaining why, despite the LRA’s authorship of the formula, HUD might be “liable for the\nmisconduct alleged,” plaintiffs point only to “HUD’s approval of the formula (and other actions).”  Id.\nYet, plaintiffs have alleged no facts that indicate HUD had a reason–or even the ability under existing\nregulations–to deny approval of the program.  Supra at 7 n.2.  The Twombly Court specifically rejected\nthe validity of a claim supported by “‘no set of facts.’”  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 561-63 (citation omitted). \nSee also Aktieselskabet v. Fame Jeans Inc., 525 F.3d. 8, 15, 17 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (finding that “it has\nnever been literally true, as Twombly noted, that a complaint is adequate unless “no set of facts”\nconsistent with the complaint could support a claim . . . a complaint needs some information about the\ncircumstances giving rise to the claims.”).  As to the alleged “other actions,” such a vague assertion of\nwrongdoing has never been an acceptable allegation as it fails to provide “the defendant fair notice of\nwhat the plaintiff’s claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.”  Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47\n(1957).  Plaintiffs’ Complaint gives no explanation of what specific actions HUD took or failed to take\nto cause the alleged disparate impact of the Road Home program, instead gesturing vaguely towards\nHUD’s “ongoing oversight and continuing approval” of the program.  Compl. ¶ 51.  HUD has not,\ntherefore, had “fair notice” as to the misconduct alleged against it.\nEven if plaintiffs had alleged facts to create a reasonable inference that HUD would be liable\n- 27 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 38    Filed 07/08/09   Page 34 of 38\nfor alleged defects in the Road Home formula, plaintiffs’ §§ 3604, 3605, and 3608 claims should still\nbe dismissed because the alleged defects are not sufficient to raise a claim of disparate impact\ndiscrimination.  As the Twombly Court explained, “when the allegations in a complaint, however true,\ncould not raise a claim of entitlement to relief, ‘this basic deficiency should . . . be exposed at the point\nof minimum expenditure of time and money by the parties and the court.’”  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 558\n(quoting 5 Wright & Miller § 1216, at 233-34).  Here, while plaintiffs have alleged facts that, if taken\nas true, might allow a reasonable inference that one part of the grant “formula” in the Road Home\nprogram–examined in isolation–has a disparate impact on African Americans, they have alleged no\nfacts that indicate that the program in its entirety imposes a statistically significant disparate impact on\nAfrican Americans.  Thus, their allegations, “however true, could not raise a claim of entitlement to\nrelief.”  Id.  The LRA’s Road Home program does not simply distribute funds based solely on the value\nof a home.  The program also provides up to $50,000 in Additional Compensation Grants for\nhomeowners with household incomes no more than 80 percent of the median income in the parish\nwhere the house was located.  HUD Mot. to Dismiss at 12-13.  In addition, it provides Individual\nMitigation Measures and Elevation Incentives to eligible homeowners, without reference to the\nproperty value of the homes.  Id.  The statistics and facts that plaintiffs present to demonstrate that\nAfrican-American home values are lower than those of whites are not, therefore, sufficient to create a\n“reasonable inference” that the Road Home program imposes a disparate impact on African\nAmericans.  See id. at 41-42.  To survive this motion to dismiss, plaintiffs would need to allege some\nset of facts that would support the contention that, even with the potentially mitigating measures of the\nAdditional Compensation Grants and the availability of other funds untethered to home values, the\nRoad Home program still disparately impacts African Americans.  See id. at 43.  Plaintiffs have alleged\nno facts at all regarding the effects of the Individual Mitigation Measures and the Elevation Incentives,\nCompl. passim, and have simply put forth the conclusory statement in the Complaint that “[t]he\n- 28 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 38    Filed 07/08/09   Page 35 of 38\nAdditional Compensation Grant . . . does not eliminate the discriminatory disparities in grant amounts.” \nCompl ¶ 59.  But the Iqbal and Twombly Courts specifically found that if “allegations are conclusory,”\nthey are “not entitled to be assumed true.”  Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1951 (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at\n554-55). \nFinally, as demonstrated above, supra at 4, plaintiffs have not even shown that §§ 3604(a) and\n3605(a) are applicable to HUD’s actions in this case.  They have failed to cite a single case supporting\ntheir contention that §§ 3604(a) and 3605(a) are meant to govern HUD’s supervision of the LRA\nprograms.  Plaintiffs have also put forth no case law in support of their contention that HUD’s actions\nin connection with the development and administration of a single grant formula can constitute a\nviolation of § 3608(d) or (e)(5).  Plaintiffs only cite cases in which § 3608(d) and (e)(5) violations are\nclaimed on the strength of allegations of a constitutional violation or a pattern and practice of\ndiscriminatory agency behavior.  Pl. Opp’n at 56 (citing Otero v. NYC Hsg. Auth., 484 F. 2d 1122,\n1134 (2d Cir. 1973), Darst-Webbe, 417 F. 3d at 907; NAACP, 817 F. 2d at 155; Lee v. Pierce, 698 F.\nSupp at 342).  The Otero court looked to § 3608 to find further evidence of a constitutional mandate to\n“act affirmatively to achieve integration,” in the face of a constitutional violation.  Otero, 484 F. 2d at\n1133.  Plaintiffs have alleged no such constitutional violation on the part of HUD in this case. \nSimilarly, NAACP v. HUD found only that HUD’s alleged “pattern” of failure to affirmatively further\nfair housing was reviewable under the APA.  817 F.2d at 158.  See also Darst-Webbe, 417 F. 3d. at 907\n(finding HUD met its obligation to affirmatively further fair housing in its approval of a series of loans\nand housing plans over the course of “long history” of a revitalization project); Lee v. Pierce, 698 F.\nSupp at 342 (challenging a pattern of sales of homes to non-homeless individuals).  Thus, plaintiffs\nhave not demonstrated that the allegedly disparate impact of HUD’s actions in connection with a single\ngrant constitutes a violation of § 3608(d) or (e)(5).  As a result of this failure, and plaintiffs’ failure to\nallege facts sufficient to support a “reasonable inference” that HUD is liable for the disparate impact of\n- 29 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 38    Filed 07/08/09   Page 36 of 38\nthe Road Home program, or even a “reasonable inference” that the program in its entirety has a\ndisparate impact, this Court should dismiss the §§ 3604, 3605, and 3608(d) and (e)(5) claims against\nHUD.  Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949. \nB. Plaintiffs Have Failed to Allege the Elements of a Violation of 42 U.S.C.\n§ 5304(b)(2) Against HUD\nAs HUD demonstrated in its motion to dismiss, plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under\n§ 5304(b)(2) against HUD.  HUD Mot. to Dismiss at 43-44.  Section 5304(b)(2) states that a grant\n“shall be made only if the grantee certifies to the satisfaction of [HUD] that . . . the grantee will\naffirmatively further fair housing.”  Plaintiffs do not allege that grantees failed to submit such\ncertification.  Compl. passim.  HUD’s implementing regulations state that such “certification[s] . . . are\nsatisfactory to [HUD] . . . unless [HUD] has determined pursuant to [its review and audit functions set\nout in] § 570.493 that the State has not complied with the requirements of this subpart.”  24 C.F.R.\n§ 570.485(c).  Plaintiffs do not allege that there was any evidence of past defects in Louisiana’s grant\nadministration, nor any evidence of a defect in Louisiana’s certification.  Compl. passim.  Indeed,\nplaintiffs do not allege that HUD would have had any reason to know that the LRA certifications might\nbe unsatisfactory or that the Road Home Program might have a disparate impact on African-\nAmericans.  Compl. passim.  \nIV. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, this Court should grant HUD’s motion to dismiss for lack of subject\nmatter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim.\n- 30 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 38    Filed 07/08/09   Page 37 of 38\nDated:  July 8, 2009\nRespectfully submitted,\nMICHAEL F.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n  Plaintiffs’ claims against Defendant, Paul Rainwater, Executive Director of the Louisiana \nRecovery Authority, (hereinafter “Rainwater”), should be dismissed for lack of subject matter \njurisdiction and for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  \nPlaintiffs have filed this civil action against Defendants, U.S. Department of Housing and \nUrban Development (hereinafter “HUD”) 1 and Rainwater on November 12, 2008. (Complaint, \n¶¶ 18-19.)  Neither the State of Louisiana nor the Louisiana Recovery Authority  (“LRA”), the \nLouisiana state agency responsible for designing and  administering the Road Home, are named \nas Defendants.  Plaintiffs filed this suit as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23  and \npropose a class that consists of “all African American homeow ners in New Orleans who \nparticipated in the Road Home Program or who will participate by the first day of trial, whose \ngrant amounts were calculated or will be calculated based on the pre-storm value of their homes, \nand who have selected or will select the  program’s option of using the funds to repair or rebuild \ntheir homes.” (Complaint, ¶ 21.) Plaintiffs allege that more than twenty thousand (20,000) \nAfrican American homeowners in New Orleans are members of the putative class. (Complaint, ¶ \n1.)   \nPlaintiffs contend that the formula developed and used by the  LRA and the Road Home \nprogram2 in determining and awarding compensation and incentive grants to homeowners whose \nhomes were damaged or destroyed by Hurricanes Katrina and/or Rita and who chose to receive  \ngrant awards under “Option 1,”  imposes a disparate impact on African Americans in violation of \nthe Fair Housing Act (“FHA”), 42 U.S.C. § 3601,  et seq., and the Housing and Community \n                                                \n1 Rainwater adopts and incorporates by reference HUD’s statement of facts contained in the Background, \nSection II (D)(1-4). (HUD’s Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss, Rec. Doc.22, pp. 9-14.) \n \n2 Plaintiffs do not allege Rainwater, as Executive Director, designed or administered the Road Home \nProgram or the challenged formula for receiving Option 1 grants. \n  1 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 10 of 54\n \nDevelopment Act of 1974 (“HCDA ”), 42 U.S.C. § 5301 , et seq. (Complaint, ¶¶ 1, 74 -77.)  The \nchallenged formula is criticized by Plaintiffs as it begins with the pre-storm value of the home as \nthe basis for the formula, unless the estimated cost of damage or estimated cost to replace the \nhome is less than the pre-storm value, in which case the formula uses the lower of these figures \nas the basis of the calculation. (Complaint, ¶ 3.)   Plaintiffs seek this  Court to declare the \nDefendants’ acts and policy discriminatory, order all appropriate injunctive relief, and to remedy \nthe effects of Defendants’ violations,  including “recalculating Road Home homeowner grants ” \nin a non-discriminatory manner.  (Complaint, Request for Relief, p. 17.)(emphasis added). \n  Plaintiffs allege subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 , 28 U.S.C. § \n1343(a)(3-4) and 42 U.S.C. § 3613 (a).  (Complaint, ¶ 8.)   Plaintiffs also seek declaratory and \ninjunctive relief under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201  and 2202. (Complaint, ¶ 9.)   Rainwater contends that \nthis Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs ’ claims against him because he is \nentitled to immunity under the  Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution.  \nRainwater asserts that the doctrine of Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S. Ct. 441, 52 L. Ed. 714 \n(1908) (allowing suits for pros pective injunctive relief against state officials in their official \ncapacity), is not applicable in this case and does not permit the retrospective declaratory and \ninjunctive relief requested by Plaintiffs.   \n  Further, Plaintiffs have failed to state a cla im upon which relief can be granted against \nRainwater under the FHA and/or HCDA.  The Road Home program was designed and intended \nto serve as a compensation program, not a housing program, to those Lo uisiana homeowners \nimpacted by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Therefore, because Option 1 of  the Road  Home \nprogram is a compensation program to provide unrestricted funds to citizens who are already \nhomeowners, the Fair Housing Act does not apply.   Further,  the HCDA does not apply as the \n  2 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 11 of 54\n \nexclusive remedy under the HCDA  is through HUD’s enforcement mechanisms as specifically \noutlined by Congress in 42 U.S.C. § 5311.  Indeed, HUD approved LRA’s action plans and, thus \nassured that  LRA’s policies were in compliance with all applicable rules and regulations  for \nreceiving Community Development Block Grants . Simply stated, HUD has not deemed that \nLouisiana is in violation of any provision of the HCDA , and Plaintiffs have no private right of \naction against Defendant Rainwater under the HCDA.    \n  Nevertheless, this Court need not reach these substantive issues as Defendant, Rainwater, \nmoves this Honorable Court to transfer this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404  to the Middle \nDistrict of Louisiana or, alternatively, to the Eastern District of Louisiana , for further resolution.  \nMr. Rainwater and the Louis iana Recovery Authority are located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. \nMost of the witnesses and documents will be located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  Moreover, the \nfive named Plaintiffs, twenty thousand putative class members and the Greater New Orleans Fair \nHousing Action Center are located in New Orleans, Louisiana.  Therefore, for the convenience \nof the parties and witnesses and in the interest of justice, Rainwater requests this case be \ntransferred to Louisiana. \nII.  THIS  CASE AGAINST PAUL RAINWATER, IN HIS OFF ICIAL \nCAPACITY AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE LOUISIANA  \nRECOVERY AUTHORITY, IS BARRED BY  THE  ELEVENTH \nAMENDMENT             \n \nA.    Standard of Review for a Motion to Dismiss Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) \n  Federal courts have limited jurisdiction.  They may hear  only those cases entrusted to \nthem by a grant of power contained in either the Constitution on in an Act of Congress.   City of \nKenosha v. Bruno , 412 U.S. 507, 511, 93 S. Ct. 2222, 37 L. Ed. 2d 109 (1973) ; Loughlin v. \nUnited States,  393 F.3d 155, 170 (D.C. Cir. 2004) .  It  is the plaintiffs’ burden of proof to \nestablish that the court has subject matter jurisdiction to hear the case.   Brady Campaign to \n  3 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 12 of 54\n \nPrevent Gun Violence United with the Million Mom March  v. Ashcroft, 339 F.Supp.2d 68, 72 \n(D.C. Cir. 2004); In re: Swine Flu Immunization Prods. Liab. Liti g., 880 F.2d  1439, 1442-43 \n(D.C. Cir. 1989).   A court may accept all of the factual allegations in the complaint as true when \nevaluating a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,  United States v. Gaubert, \n499 U.S. 315, 322, 111 S.Ct. 1267, 113 L.Ed. 2d 335 (1991) , it may also consider certain \nmaterials beyond the pleadings in considering a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1).   See \nJerome Stevens Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Food and Drug Admin. , 402 F.3d 1249, 1253-54 (D.C. \nCir. 2005).  For example, “[t]he court may consider the complaint supplemen ted by undisputed \nfacts evidenced in the record, or the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts plus the court’s \nresolution of disputed facts.”  Herbert v. Nat’l. Acad.  of Sciences, 974 F.2d 192, 197 (D.C. Cir. \n1992).   \nB.  The State of Louisiana and The Louisiana Recovery Authority Are the Real \nParties in Interest, Not Paul Rainwater     \n \n  The question of whether federal jurisdiction  exists is not always free from doubt , and a \nfederal court may have to examine and determine the facts and the law before concluding \nwhether jurisdiction is appropriate.  “Thus, it follows that a court has jurisdiction to determine its \nown jurisdiction.  United States v. United Mine Workers of America, 330 U.S. 258, 292, 67 S.Ct. \n677, 91 L.Ed. 884 (1947). \n  The essential inquiry in an Eleventh Amendment challenge is whether the state, although \nnot named in the action, is the real party in interest.    Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 663, 94 \nS. Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974).  A state may be the party with a substantiated interest when \nenforcement of the court’s decree would effect the state’s political or property rights.  Hopkins v. \nClemson Agricultural College of South Carolina, 221 U.S. 636, 642, 31 S. Ct. 654, 55 L.Ed. 890 \n(1911).  In order to safeguard such rights, sovereign i mmunity bars suits whose direct outcome \n  4 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 13 of 54\n \nwill diminish the public treasury through the award of retroactive damages.   Ford Motor Co. v. \nDept of Treasury, 323 U.S. 459, 464, 65 S. Ct. 347, 89 L.Ed. 389 (1945)  (“…[W]hen the action \nis in essence one for the re covery of money from the state, the state is the real, substantial party \nin interest and is entitled to invoke its sovereign immunity from suit even though individual \nofficials are nominal defendants.”), overruled on other grounds by, Lapides v. Board of Regents \nof the University System of Georgia , 555 U.S. 613, 122 S.Ct, 1640, 152 L.Ed.2d 806 (2002) . \nSuch suits involve compensatory or deterrent’s interest that are insufficient to overcome the \ncompelling justifications for a state’s sovereign immunity.   \n  Plaintiffs in this case challenge  the Road  Home formula design , claiming  it  \n“disproportionately burdens African American homeowners and hinders their ability to return to \ntheir homes compared to white families.”  (Complaint, ¶ 58.)   However, this Court needs to look \nno further than paragraphs 49 and 51 of  Plaintiffs’ Complaint to ascertain that the  LRA, and not \nits Executive Director , Paul Rainwater, is responsible for  the Road Home design and grant \nformula.   Plaintiffs admit the following facts:   \n49.  The LRA, in consultation with HUD, proposed and \ndeveloped the Road Home grant formula and the details of the \nRoad Home Program. \n \n51.  The LRA administers the Road Home Program subject to \nongoing oversight and continuing approval by HUD.   \n \n(Complaint, ¶¶ 49, 51.) \n \n  Thus, Plaintiffs have named Paul Rainwater, in his official capacity as Executive Director \nof the Louisiana Recovery Authority, as a nominal defendant in an attempt to avail themselves of \nthe legal fiction of Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908).   Although \ncited in the Complaint, Plaintiffs ignore the exp ress statutory provisions which created the  LRA \nin 2006, by the Louisiana legislature in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.  This Louisiana \n  5 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 14 of 54\n \nstatute provides that the  LRA, not its Executive Director, has the authority to establish a “clear \nand effective process for the implementation of action plans for the CDBG program.”  All of the \naction plans must be approved by the Joint Legislative Committee on the Budget, a majority of \nthe elected members of each house of the Louisiana legislature, the Governor, and HUD.    \n    La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 49:220.4 provides in pertinent part: \nA.  (1)  The Louisiana Recovery Authority is hereby created as a \nstate agency within the office of the governor, division of \nadministration.    The authority shall be a body corporate with \npower to sue and be sued.  The domicile of the authority shall be in \nthe parish of East Baton Rouge.  The purpose of the authority shall \nbe to recommend policy, planning and resource allocation \naffecting programs and services for the recovery, to implement \nprograms and provide services to the recovery, and to identify \nduplication of services relative to the recovery where appropriate. \nThe authority shall carry out its functions to support the most \nefficient and effective use of resources for the recovery. \n \n(2)   The board shall provide leadership and oversight for the \nactivities of the authority. \n \n(3)  The authority shall have an executive director who shall be \nappointed by the governor and subject to confirmation by th e \nSenate.  The executive director shall serve at the pleasure of the \ngovernor and shall be paid a salary which shall be fixed by the \ngovernor.   The executive director shall be responsible to the \ngovernor and the board.  \n \nLa. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 49:220.4. \n \n  La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 49:220.5 outlines the powers, duties and functions of the LRA and \nits Executive Director, and provides a comprehensive approval process for adopting policies and \nprocedures for receiving Community Development Block Grants  (CDBG).  Under this statutory \nscheme, the LRA has the initial authority and responsibility to develop proposals relat ed to \nLouisiana’s recovery from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita , including C DBG proposals, action \nplans, partial action plans, amendments to action plans or partial action plans. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \n  6 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 15 of 54\n \n§ 44:220.5(C)(1)(a). After developing and approving a proposal  or action plan , the LRA then \nsends the it to the Louisiana Governor for approval. Id.  If the Governor approves the proposal or \naction plan, it is then submitted to the Joint Legislative Committee on the Budget for review and \napproval, and, simultaneously submitted for review to the appropriate oversight committees of \nthe Louisiana House of Representatives and the Senate.  Id.  If a proposal amounts to ten million \ndollars  ($10,000,000.00) or more, the proposal  or action plan  must also be approved by a \nmajority of elected members of each house of the legislature.  La. Rev. Stat.  Ann.  § \n49:220.5(C)(1)(b).  Once these steps are taken, the Louisiana Governor then submits the proposal \nor action plan to HUD for approval. La. Rev. Stat. Ann.  § 49:220.5(C)(1)(c).  Action plans and \nother policies and procedures for procuring CDBG funds undergo rigorous, multi-step processes, \nwith multiple avenues of input and review, before they are finally approved by the State and \nHUD.  In other words, Paul Rainwater, as the Executive  Director of the LRA, does not have the \nsole or final authority to develop policies and procedures as related to action plans; instead, this \nis a collaborative process with multiple layers of review.  \nC.  Plaintiffs Fail to Allege a Waiver of Sovereign Immu nity by Rainwater, the \nLouisiana Recovery Authority or the State of Louisiana \n   \nPlaintiffs fail to address the issue of sovereign immunity in their Complaint.  Further, \nPlaintiffs fail to invoke the doctrine of Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S. Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed 714 \n(1908), in their Complaint.  These fatal omissions can only lead this Court to conclude that the \nEleventh Amendment bars Plaintiffs from pursuing their claims against Rainwater in federal \ncourt. \nThe Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution provides:  \nThe Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to \nextend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted \n  7 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 16 of 54\n \nagainst on the United States by  Citizens of another  State, or by \nCitizens or subjects of any Foreign State.  \n  \nU.S. Const. amend. XI. \n  The Eleventh Amendment  not only bars suits against the state by citizens of another \nstate, but also applies  equally to suits against a state initiated by that state’s own citizens.  \nEdelman v. Jordan ,  414 U.S. 651, 663, 94 S. Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974);  Hans v. \nLouisiana, 134 U.S. 1, 13 -15, 10 S. Ct. 504, 33 L.Ed. 842 (1890) .  For example, if a lawsuit \nseeks to order the state officer to pay funds directly from the state treasury for the wrongful acts \nof the state, then the state is the real party in interests and the Eleventh Amendment bars the suit.  \nEdelman, 415 U.S. at 663. Moreover, the Eleventh Amendment  prohibits suits against states \nofficials where the state is, in fact, the real party in interest.  See Pennhurst State School & Hosp. \nv. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 101-02, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984).   \nThe Court in Pennhurst noted: \nWhen the suit is brought only against state officials, a question arises as to \nwhether that suit is a suit against the State itself.  Although prior decisions \nof this Court have not been entirely consistent on this issue, certain \nprinciples are well established.  The Eleventh Amendment bars a suit \nagainst state officials when “the state is the real, substantial party in \ninterest.” Ford Motor Co. v. Departmen t of the Treasury , 323 U.S. 459, \n464, 65 S.Ct. 347, 350, 89 L.Ed 389 (1945) . Thus, “[t]he general rule is \nthat relief sought nominally against an officer is, in fact, against the \nsovereign if the decree would  o perate against the latter.”  Hawaii v. \nGordon, 373 U.S. 57, 58. 83 S.Ct. 1052, 1053, 10 L.Ed2d 191  (1693)(per \ncuriam).  And, when the state i tself is named as the defendant, a suit \nagainst state officials that is in fact a suit against the State is barred \nregardless of whether it seeks damages or injunctive relief.  \n \nPennhurst, 465 U.S. at 101-102. \n \nEleventh Amendment immunity is, however, subject to three primary exceptions: \n \n  (1)  Congressional abrogation;  \n \n  8 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 17 of 54\n \n  (2)  Waiver by the state; and, \n \n(3)  Suits against individual state officers for prospective \ninjunctive and declaratory relief to end an on going \nviolation of federal law.  \n \nPennsylvania Fed’n of Sportsmen’s Clubs, Inc. v. Hess, 297 F.3d 310, 323 (3d Cir. 2002).    \nUnder the first prong  of the abrogation test, in order for Congress to abrogate the state’s \nsovereign immunity as granted by the Eleventh Amendment , Congress must (1) intend to do so \nunequivocally and (2) act under a validate grant under of Congressional authority.   Board of \nTrustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett , 531 U.S. 356, 363 -64, 121 S.Ct. 955, 148 \nL.Ed.2d 866 (2001 ).  The Supreme Court in  Edelman held that a court will find waiver only \nwhere it is stated “by the most express languag e or by such overwhelming implications from the \ntext as [will] leave no room for any other reasonable construction.”  Edelman, 415 U.S. at 673.  \n   Plaintiffs in this case brought suit under the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 36 01, et \nseq., and the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, 42 U.S.C. § 5301 , et seq.  \nThere is no express waiver of the State of Louisiana’s sovereign immunity in the Fair Housing \nAct or in the Housing and Community Development Act.   See Gregory v. South Carolina Dept. \nof Transportation, 289 F.Supp.2d 721 (D.S.C. 2003),  aff’d, 114 Fed. Appx. 87 (4 th Cir. 2004), \ncert. denied, 544 U.S. 999, 125 S.Ct. 1932, 161 L.Ed.2d 773 (2005). \nAs for the second prong, the State of Louisiana has in no way waived its Eleventh \nAmendment immunity in this case. By statute, Louisiana has refused any such waiver of its \nEleventh Amendment sovereign immunity regarding suits in federal courts. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § \n13:5106(A); Cozzo v. Tangipahoa Parish Council-President Government, 279 F.3d 273, 280-81 \n(5th Cir. 2002).  Moreover, the State of Louisiana has not consented to be sued in federal court. \n  9 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 18 of 54\n \nInstead, in the instant case, Plai ntiffs are presumably proceeding under the third prong.  \nHowever, it is important to note that this lawsuit does not challenge the constitutionality of Mr. \nRainwater’s actions as Executive Director of the  LRA.  Instead, Plaintiffs have focused only on \nthe alleged disparate impact of LRA’s formula for calculating Road Home benefits under Option \n1 for African American homeowners in New Orleans. \nD.  The Ex parte Young Exception Is Inapplicable \nIn the landmark case of  Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28, S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed 714, 932 \n(1908), the U.S. Supreme Court reviewed the jailing of the Minnesota Attorney General who had \nbeen enjoined by a federal court for imposing what stockholders of a railroad believed onero us \nrates on railroads in that state.  The plaintiff argued that the state law constituted a confiscation \nof property without due process and, therefore, was unconstitutional.  Obviously, if the court \nissued the injunction it would have the effect of stoppi ng the state from enforcing its statute.  \nThat would constitute a judgment against the state, and arguably it would run afoul of the \nEleventh Amendment.   \nThe Supreme Court concluded that the Eleventh Amendment  did not bar an action \nagainst a state officer to restrain unconstitutional conduct on his part under color of state law.   \nAccordingly, the case could proceed in federal court.  The Court noted that a state could not \ninstruct its officer to act in an illegal way.  If an officer acted illegally, as the Attorney General of \nMinnesota was alleged to have done, he would be stripped of any representative character and of \nthe constitutional immunity that otherwise would protect that conduct.  In other words, when the \nofficer acts illegally, he is no longer acting for the state and is thus not entitled to the state’s \nEleventh Amendment immunity.   Ex parte Young , 209 U.S. at 159 -60.  “The  Young doctrine \nrecognizes that if  a state official violates federal law, he is stripped of his official or \n  10 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 19 of 54\n \nrepresentative character and may be personally liable for his conduct; the state cannot cloak the \nofficer in its sovereign immunity.”   Idaho v. Coeur d’Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U.S. 261, 288, \n117 S.Ct. 2028, 2043, 138 L.Ed.2d 438 (1997)  (O’Connor, J. joined by Scalia and Thomas, J.J., \nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment). \nWhether a litigant’s claim falls under the  Ex parte Young  exception to the Eleventh \nAmendment which bars against suing a state is a “straightforward inquiry” that “asks whether \n[the]  complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly \ncharacterized as prospective.”    Verizon Maryland, Inc. v. Public Service Commission of \nMaryland, 535 U.S. 635, 645, 122 S. Ct. 1753, 152 L.Ed. 2d 871 (2002) .  The court has also \nidentified other relevant considerations.  I n Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida,  517 U.S. 44, \n76, 116 S.Ct. 1114, 1133, 134 L.Ed.2d 252 (1996), for example, the Supreme Court has held that \nEx parte Young is inapplicable where Congress has devised a comprehensive remedial scheme \nthat prevents the federal courts from fashioning an appropriate equitable remedy.  More recently, \nthe court concluded in Coeur d’Alene that the  Ex parte Young fiction cannot be employed where \ncertain sovereignty interests are present, as they are when the administration and ownership of \nstate land is threatened.  See, Coeur d’Alene, 521 U.S. at 281, 287.       \nIn the instant case, the Ex parte Young exception does not apply since Plaintiffs, by their \nown admission in the Complaint,  acknowledge the LRA, and not Paul Rainwater in his official \ncapacity as Executive Director of the LRA, was responsible for proposing, developing  and \ndesigning the Road Home Option 1 grant formula 3. (Complaint, ¶¶  49, 51.)  Thus, the facts of \n                                                \n3\nRainwater specifically rejects HUD’s argument that Plaintiffs can maintain t heir claims for declaratory \nand injunctive relief under the FHA and HCDA directly against Rainwater under the doctrine of  Ex parte Young.  \n(HUD’s Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss, Rec. Doc. 22,  pp. 32-33.) \n \n  11 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 20 of 54\n \nthe instant case can easily be di stinguished from the facts of  Ex parte Young  where a state \nofficial allegedly violated state law.    \nThe Supreme Court has subsequently applied this principle in several cases allowing \nfederal courts to give injunctive or “prospec tive” relief against state officers, even in instances \nwhere compliance with the injunction would require expenditures from the state treasury.   See, \nEdelman, supra, (articulating a prospective -retroactive relief distinction an d allowing federal \ncourts to order future compliance by state officials while forbidding those courts from ordering \nthose courts payment of compensatory damages for past harms);  see also, Quern v. Jordan, 440 \nU.S. 332, 99 S.Ct. 1139, 59 L.Ed .2d 358 (1979) ; Milliken v. Bradley , 433 U.S. 267, 97 S.Ct. \n2749, 53 L.Ed.2d 745 (1977) .  In  Pennhurst State School & Hosp. v. Halderman , 465 U.S. 89, \n104 S. Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed. 2d 67 (1984), the U.S. Supreme Court summarized,  \nWhen a plaintiff sues a state official alleging a violation of federal law, the \nfederal court may award an injunction that governs the official’s future \nconduct but not one that awards retroactive monetary relief.  Under the \ntheory of Young, such a suit would not be one against the  state since the \nfederal-law allegation would strip the state officer of his official authority. \n \nPennhurst, 465 U.S. at 102-103. \n \n  In Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974), the plaintiff \nbrought a class action for injunctive and declaratory relief against Illinois officials administering \nthe federal-state benefit program of aid to the aged, blind and disabled.  Federal regulations \nrequired eli gibility determinations to be made by states within thirty days of receipt of \napplication for benefits to the aged and blind and within forty -five days within receipt of the \napplication for benefits to the disabled.  The complaint charged that Illinois off icials were not \nprocessing applications within these requirements and were authorizing benefits to commence \nwithin the month the application was approved and not including prior months of eligibility \n  12 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 21 of 54\n \nduring which an applicant was entitled to benefits.  The  district court granted a permanent \ninjunction requiring compliance with the federal time limits and ordering the officials to pay the \nbenefits wrongfully withheld.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.   \n  The U.S. Supreme Court, however, reversed that portion of the court of appeals’ decision \naffirming the district court’s ordering requiring the payment of benefits.   Edelman, 415 U.S. at \n658-59.  The Court held that  Ex parte Young “does not extend so far as  to permit a suit which \nseeks the award of an accrued monetary liability which must be met from the general revenues of \na State.…” Edelman, 415 U.S. at 664.  The Court held that the district court’s order requiring the \npayment of money which should have been paid, but was not, \n . . .   [I]s in practical effect indistinguishable in many aspects from an \naward of damages against the State.  It will to a virtual certainty be paid \nfrom state funds, and not from the pockets of the indiv idual state officials \nwho were the defendants in this action.  It is measured in terms of a \nmonetary loss resulting from a past breach of a legal duty on the part of \nthe defendant state officials.  \n \nEdelman, 415 U.S. at 668.  The fact that the relief reque sted was an injunction rather than \ndamages was irrelevant because the Court did “not read  Ex parte Young . . . to indicate that any \nform of relief may be awarded against a state officer, no matter how closely it may in practice \nresemble a money judgment payable out of the state treasury, so long as the relief may be labeled \n‘equitable’ in nature.”  Edelman, 415 U.S. at 666.  \n  In Papasan v. Allain, 478  U.S. 265, 278, 106 S.Ct. 2932, 92 L.Ed.2d 209 (1986 ), school \nchildren and local schools brought suit against Mississippi officials claiming the sale of federal \nschool land grants had violated  the state’s reported trust obligation to hold the land for the \nbenefit of school children in perpetuity.  The plaintiffs sought a declaration that the sale of the \nland was void and an order requiring the establishment of a fund be held in trust for their benefit.  \nThe plaintiffs argued that this relief was permissible under  Ex parte Young because they only \n  13 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 22 of 54\n \nsought to enforce the officials’ continuing obligation to make appropriate payments for the \nbenefit of the school children.  T he district court dismissed the plaintiffs’ trust claim, which the \nSupreme Court found was identical to their impairment of contractual obligation claim, as barred \nby the Eleventh Amendment.   Papasan, 478 U.S. at 274, n.8.  The Court of Appeals affirmed \nand the Supreme Court upheld this part of the district court’s decision.   \n  In describing the types of relief allowed by  Ex parte Young , the Supreme Court in \nPapasan stated: \nRelief that in essence serves to compensate a party injure d in the past by \nan action of a state official in his official capacity that was illegal under \nfederal law is barred even when the state official is the named defendant.  \nThis is true if the relief is expressly denominated as damages.  It is also \ntrue if the relief is tantamount to an award of damages for a past violation \nof federal law, even though styled as something else. \n \nPapasan, 478 U.S. at 278.  The  Court in Papasan held that the plaintiffs “distinction between a \ncontinuing obligation on the part of the trustee and an ongoing liability for the breach of trust is \nessentially a formal distinction of the sort we rejected in  Edelman.” Papasan, 478 U.S. at 280.  \nThe  Court reasoned that the plaintiffs’ requested relief for the officials’ breach of their \ncontinuing obligation to comply with the trust payment obligations was “in substance the award, \nas continuing income rather than as a lump sum, of an  ‘accrued monetary liability’.”  Papasan,  \n478 U.S. at 281.    \nIn this case, Defendant  Rainwater is a state official within the ambit of the Eleventh \nAmendment, and is being sued in his official capacity.  Moreover, the Complaint purports to \nseek only retrospective, injunctive relief, requesting this Court in the Request for Relief to: \na)    Certify this action as a class action on behalf of the proposed class \npursuant to Rules 23(a)  and 23(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil  \nProcedure; \n \n  14 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 23 of 54\n \nb)  Declare that Defendant’s acts, practices, policies and omissions \nhave deprived Plaintiffs of their rights under the Fair Housing Act \nof 1968 and Title I of the Housing and Community Development \nAct of 1974; \n \nc)  Order all appropriate injunctive relief as warranted, including but \nnot limited to ordering Defendants to cease immediately their \nviolations of Plaintiffs’ rights, and to remedy the invidious effects \nof their violations by recalculating Road Home homeowner grants \nin a non-discriminatory manner; \n \nd)  Order reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs to be paid by \nDefendants pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2412  and 42 U.S.C. §§ 1988 , \n3613; and \n \ne.  Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and \nequitable.  \n \n(Complaint, Request for Relief, pp. 17-18.) \n \nThe last day to apply to  the Road Home Program was July 31, 2007, and the last day to \ncomplete an interview appointment was December 15, 2007.  See \nwww.road2la.org/homeowner/overview:htm.   The injunctive relief sought by the plaintiffs that \nis “. . . recalculating Road Home homeowner grants” is a thin ly-veiled attempt to recover \nretrospective relief in the form of money damages and, therefore, barred under the Eleventh \nAmendment. \nIn distinguishing between permissible prospective and impermissible retrospective relief, \n“attempts to seize upon a state’s ‘continuing income’ by means of an prospective injunction have \nbeen held by the Supreme Court to be attempts to obtain compensation for an ‘accrued monetary \nliability.’”  Papasan, 478 U.S. at 281.       \nWhat the plaintiffs were seeking in Edelman was a “reparation for the past,” which would \nbe “measured in terms of a monetary loss resulting from a past breach of a legal duty on the part \nof the defendant state officials.”  Edelman, 414 U.S. at  665, 668.  The retroactive award that so \n  15 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 24 of 54\n \nconcerned the Edelman court was compensation  intended to repair harm caused by past acts is \nthe  same relief requested by the plaintiffs in this case, and is identical to that sought in Edelman.   \nFor purposes of the Ele venth Amendment, this Court must decide whether the relief \nbeing sought by Plaintiffs is prospective or retrospective, and the fact that Plaintiffs seek to \nrecalculate grants after the deadline to apply for compensation gran ts has expired nearly two \nyears ago should be dispositive of this issue. \nE.  The Coeur d’Alene Exception Is Applicable \nThere is also a final layer of sovereign immunity analysis that also blocks Plaintiffs’ suit.  \nThe Supreme Court in  Idaho v. Coeur d’Alene  Tribe of Idaho , 521 U.S. 261, 117 S. Ct. 2028, \n138 L.Ed.2d 438 (1997)  held that even prospective relief (in  Coeur d’Alene  declaratory \njudgment) would be barred if the relief sought is the  functional equivalent of relief otherwise \nbarred by the Eleventh Amendment  and “special sovereignty interests” are implicated.   Coeur \nd’Alene, 521 U.S. at 281.  In  Coeur d’Alene, the plaint iffs sought a declaratory judgment \nestablishing their rights to certain lands.  The court found that the suit was a “functional \nequivalent of a quiet title action  which implicated special sovereign interests.”   Coeur d’Alene, \n521 U.S. at 281-82.    \nIn this case, as it developed the Road Home program, the State of Louisiana ultimately \nchose to provide compensation and incentive grants to eligible homeowners affected by \nHurricanes Katrina or Rita of up to  $150,000.   Louisian a decided to base the amount of \ncompensation and incentives grants on the lower of the pre-storm, fair-market value of the home \nor the cost to repair or replace the home.  (Declaration of Jesse Handforth Kome, Rec. Doc. 22-2, \n¶ 18.)     \n  16 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 25 of 54\n \nThe State of Louisiana also provides additional compensation grants of up to $50,000 for \ncertain homeowners.  Total compensation and incentive grants are still capped at $150,000.  \nLouisiana offers additional compensation and incentive grants to applicants with household \nincomes 80% and below the medium income in the parish where the house was located.  In \naddition to the additional compensation, Louisiana also provides compensation and incentive \ngrants to homeowners via individual mitigation measures and elevation incentives .  Individual \nmitigation measures provide incentive grants to homeowners to install home “hardening” \nfeatures that will protect homes from future storm damage, including storm shutters and roof \ntiedowns.  Elevations incentives are grants to elevate site -built homes and mobile to meet \nFEMA’s current advisory base flood elevation or base flood elevation levels to protect against \nfuture floods.   (Kome Declaration, Rec. Doc. 22-2,  ¶ 21.) \nIn this case, the allocation of state funds by the State of Louisiana to  provide \ncompensation and incentive grants to those citizens damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita is \nan important state interest.  Plaintiffs’ attempts to compel the recalculation of homeowner grants \nis an interference with a ‘special sovereign interest’  under Coeur d’Alene thus barring Plaintiffs’ \nclaims under the Eleventh Amendment against Rainwater. \nThe Sixth Circuit in Barton v. Summers, 293 F.3d 944 (6th Cir. 2002), rejected an attempt \nby Medicaid recipients with tobacco-related illnesses to intercept tobacco settlement money due \nto Kentucky and Tennessee under a Master Settlement Agreement.  The court held that “. . . the \ninterest of a sovereign in allocating state funds is a ‘very serious’ one.”  Barton, 293 F.3d at 951, \nciting Kelly v. Metropolitan County Bd. Of Education of Nashville and Davidson County, Tenn., \n836 F.2d 986, 995 (6 th Cir. 1987) .  “Interference with the allocation of  state funds, where \n  17 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 26 of 54\n \nCongress has expressly enacted that states may allocate such funds as they please, is an \ninterference with a ‘special sovereign interest’ under Coeur d’Alene.”  Id. \nFurther, in Coeur d’Alene, the Court noted that questions will arise as to the proper scope \nand application of Ex parte Young.  The Court cautioned against an expanded scope of the Young \nexception as suggested in this case.    \nTo interpret  Young to permit a federal -court action to proceed in \nevery case where prospective declaratory and injunctive relief is \nsought against an officer, named in his individual capacity, would \nbe to adhere to empty formalism and to undermine the principle, \nreaffirmed just last term, in  Seminole Tribe , that Eleventh \nAmendment immunity represents a real limitation on the federal \ncourt’s federal-question jurisdiction.  The real interests s erved by \nthe Eleventh Amendment are not to be sacrificed to elementary \nmechanics of caption s and pleading s.  Application of the  Young \nexception must reflect a proper understanding of its role in our \nfederal system and respect for state courts instead of re flexive \nreliance on an obvious fiction. See , e.g. Pennhurst, supra at 102-\n103, 114, n. 25, 104 S.Ct. at  909, 915 n. 25 (explaining that the \nlimitation in Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 \nL.Ed.2d 662 (1974), of  Young to prospective relief representing a \nrefusal to apply the fiction in every conceivable circumstance). \n \nCoeur d’Alene, 521 U.S. at 270. \nPlaintiffs’ claims against Rainwater are barred by the Eleventh Amendment and do not \nfall within the  Ex parte Young  exception to immunity.  Therefore, Rainwater’s Motion to \nDismiss pursuant to Rule 12 (b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure should be granted \naccordingly.   \nIII.  PLAINTIFFS FAIL TO STATE A CLAIM UNDER THE FAIR HOUSING ACT  \n \nA.   Standard for Motion to Dismiss Under Fed.R.Civ. P. 12(b)(6) \nOn a motion to dismiss for failure to sta te a claim upon which relief can be granted \npursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), this Court must dismiss a claim if the plaintiff fails to plead “enough \nfacts to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.”   Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 \n  18 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 27 of 54\n \nU.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1974, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007).  The Court will construe the allegations \nand facts in the complaint in th e light most favorable to the plaintiff and must grant the plaintiff \nthe benefit of all inferences that can be derived from the facts alleged.   Barr v. Clinton, 370 F.3d \n1196, 1199 (D.C. Cir. 2004) ; Kowal v. MCI Comm unications Corp., 16 F.3d 1271, 1276 (D.C. \nCir. 1994).  However, the Court need  not accept asserted inferences or conclusory allegations \nthat are unsupported by the facts set forth in the complaint.  Kowal, 16 F.3d at 1276. \nB.   Option 1 of The Road Home’s Homeowner Assistance Program  Provides \nCompensation Grants to Eligible Homeowners \n \nThe Louisiana Road Home program is a grant program created by the Louisiana \nlegislature, funded by Community Development Block Grants provided by the HUD, and \noperated by the LRA to provide compensation to those who sustained unreimbursed damage to \ntheir homes during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.   Groby v. Davis, 575 F.Supp.2d 762 (E.D. La. \n2008). In the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, Congress appropriated funds fo r disaster \nrelief to be administered through HUD’s Community Development Block Grant Program.  HUD  \ndistributed some of these funds to Louisiana, which in turn created the Road Home program to \ndistribute these funds as grants to homeowners in  thirty-seven (37) parishes (counties)4.  See In \nre Katrina Canal Breaches Consolidated Litigation, 2009 WL 546660, at *1 (E.D. La. March 5, \n2009). Road Home grants are designed to compensate homeowners up to $150,000 for structural \ndamage, exclusive of contents damages, cause by Hurricanes Katrina or Rita. Id. \nIn the Complaint, Plaintiffs Gloria Burns , Rhonda Dents, Almarie Ford, Daphne Jones \nand Edward Randolph all stipulate that they were homeowners as of August 29, 2005, and thus \n                                                \n4 The thirty-seven (37) parishes (counties) are: Acadia, Allen, Ascension, Assumption, Calcasieu, Cameron, \nBeauregard, East Baton Rouge, East Feliciana, Evangeline, Iberia, Iberville, Jefferson, Jefferson Davis, Lafayette, \nLafourche, Livingston, Orleans, Pointe Coupee, Plaquemines, Sabine, St. Bernard, St. Charles, St. Helena, St. \nJames, St. John, St. Landry, St. Mary, St. Martin, St. Tammany, Tangipahoa, Terrebone, Vermillion, Vernon, \nWashington, West Baton Rouge and West Feliciana.  \n  19 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 28 of 54\n \nwere eligible to receive compensation grants pursuant to the Road Home requirements; all five \nnamed Plaintiffs likewise chose Option 1, i.e., to remain in the homes. (Complaint, ¶¶ 13-17, 21.)  \nPlaintiffs are contesting only one aspect of the Road Home Program —the formula used to \ncalculate grants to homeowners who choose Option 1 under the homeowner’s program, entitled \n“Option 1: Stay” or, alternatively, “Option 1: Homeowner Staying in Home.” (Complaint, ¶ 21: \nAction Plan, Seventh Amendment, attached Ex. A, §§ 2.4.2, 2.4.4, pp. 8,10.)   In particular, \nPlaintiffs allege that the formula, which requires using the lesser of eithe r the pre-storm value of \nthe home or the estimated cost to repair or replace the home, creates a discriminatory disparate \nimpact for African American homeowners in Orleans Parish. (Complaint, ¶ 3; Ex. A, §2.4.4, p. \n10)    \n  In fact, the Road Home program at  issue (Option 1) is not a housing program and in no \nway involves residential real estate transactions.  Instead, the challenged Road Home program is \nsolely a compensation program. (Kome Declaration, Rec. Doc. 22-2, ¶ 18.) (“As it developed the \nRoad Home program, Louisiana ultimately chose to provide  compensation and incentive grants \nto eligible homeowners . . ..”) (emphasis added).  In fact, as Kome testifies and attests, the LRA \nconsidered implementing a traditional housing rehabilitation and reconstruction program, but due \nto costs and technical requirements associated with a housing program, the LRA opted instead \nfor a compensation and grant program. (Kome Declaration, Rec. Doc. 22-2, ¶ 16.)    \nThe Road Home compensation program is fully explained and de fined in the LRA’s \nAction Plan, Seventh Amendment, dated November 30, 2006, which is referred to by Plaintiffs \nin their Complaint. (Complaint, ¶ 44; Ex. A.)  This Action Plan clearly and unequivocally \ndesignates the program as a compensation program.  (Exhibit A.) Option 1 of compensation \nprogram does not provide housing or otherwise engage in residential real estate transactions. (Ex. \n  20 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 29 of 54\n \nA, §2.2, p.  5.)  Section 1.1 of the Action Plan  outlines the goals of  the Road Home Housing \nPrograms, including to: \n•  Provide compensation to homeowners for damages to their \nhomes related to Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita  \n \n(Ex. A, §1.1, p. 3)(emphasis added).  In summarizing the various programs, the Action Plan \nstates: \nThe homeowner assistance activities consist of the following: \n \n•  Funds provided to homeowners as (i)  compensation grants \nfor hurricane damage to their home, without limitations \nwith respect to income, and additional  compensation in the \nform of affordable compensation loans for eligible \nhomeowners (i.e., those  whose household income are less \nthan are [sic] equal to 80% of median income for the \naffected area) . . ..Homeowners can elect to receive their \nassistance (i.e., as  compensation for losses if they elect to \nretain their home . . .). After certain deductions , the \nhomeowner has complete discretion as to the use of the \ncompensation grant funds received, as allowable by State \nand Federal law, as they work through their personal \ndisaster recovery situation.  \n \n(Ex. A, § 2.1, pp. 4 -5)(emphasis added).  This provision clearly provides that the compensation \nfunds do not necessarily need to be spent on housing and/or housing repairs; instead, the \nhomeowners have “complete discretion as to the use of the compensation grants.” (Ex. A,  § 2.1, \np.5; see also § 2.1, p.5, “Th e covenants do not require program funds to be used to meet these \nconditions.”)  \nThe Action Plan also explains that the compensation grants are not designed to cover \n100% of the rebuilding costs for each homeowner. (Ex. A, §  2.4.1, p.  8.)  Likewise, the \ncompensation grants are not annually funded entitlement programs, and thus cannot go over \nbudget. (Ex. A, § 2.4.1, p. 8.)  \n  21 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 30 of 54\n \nThough it is the intent of the program that homeowners have \nsufficient resources to get back in to a home, not every homeowner \nis neces sarily entitled to the maximum amount of financial \nassistance.  In many cases, the Road Home will not provide 100% \nof the resources the homeowner needs to recover from the losses \nsuffered as a result of Hurricane Rita or Hurricane Katrina.  This is \ntrue for many reasons, such as the fact that assistance is capped at \n$150,000, labor and material costs in Louisiana are very high, and \nassistance is reduced by any hazard insurance, flood insurance, \nFEMA benefits and other compensation payments received by the \nhomeowner for the losses due to Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane \nRita. \n \nNote that Road Home is not an annually funded entitlement \nprogram and cannot go over budget.  If costs exceed budgeted \nprojections, grant assistance to homeowners may have to be \nreduced and the Program may be required to pro -rate remaining \nbenefits for homeowners who have not received funds from the \nprogram.  \n \n(Ex. A, § 2.4.1, p. 8.) \nThe Action Plan also explains the formula under Option 1 of the homeowners assistance \nprogram: \nFigure 1- COMPENSATION GRANT FOR OPTION 1: STAY \n \nEquals the following up to $150,000 \n \nPre-Storm value* (Minus) other Compensation [FEMA, Insurance, \nother funds](Minus) 30% Penalty for failure to have insurance if \napplicable \n \n*Note: If the Estimated Cost of Damage or  Estimated Cost to \nReplace Home is less than the Pre -Store value, the Estimated Cost \nof Damage/Estimated Cost to Replace Home will be used instead \nof PSV in the calculation.  \n \n(Ex. A, § 2.4.4, p. 10.)  In other words, the Action Plan presumes that the  pre-storm value of the \nhome will be the basis for the grant calculation, unless the estimated cost of damage or estimated \ncost to replace the home is less than the pre-storm value of the home, in which case the estimated \ncost of  damage/ estimated cost to  replace will be used as the basis for the formula. (Ex. A, § \n  22 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 31 of 54\n \n2.4.4, p. 10.)  Appendix 1 to the Action Plan provides examples of how hypothetical households \nmight be assisted under Option 1 and how the formula would be applied. (Ex.A, Appendix 1, pp. \n16-21.) \n  Further, Action Plan Amendment 14 dated May 17, 2007, clarifies the previous  action \nplans to clearly and unequivocally designate the program as a compensation program. Indeed, \nthe Introduction5 states: “These changes are being submitted to resolve HUD’s conce rn that \nLouisiana’s program did not comply with the requirements of a true compensation program .” \n(Action Plan Amendment 14, Ex. B, § 1, p. 1.)(emphasis added).  In other words, in case there \nwas any doubt or confusion, the LRA clarified that its program w as and is a “true compensation \nprogram.” (Ex. B,  §1, p. 1.)   \nAlthough Amendment 14 does not substantively change the program, it adds provisions \nto clarify the intent of the LRA that the program be a true compensation program. For instance, § \n2.4.2 adds the four types of benefits available for under Option 1, including: \n1.  Compensation grants —To cover  uninsured, uncompensated  \ndamages incurred by the homeowner as a result of Hurricane \nKatrina or Hurricane Rita.  \n \n2.  Elevation Assistance \n \n•  Elevation Compensation  for those homeowners who \nselect Option 1 and whose property is subject to the \nlatest available FEMA guidance for base flood \nelevations . . .;  \n \n*     *    * \n \n  3.  Additional Compensation Grant—Funding of up to $50,000 for \nhomeowners with income at or below  80% of area median \nincome. \n \n                                                \n5The Introduction also explains th at Amendment 14 “is to be considered current policy upon its \npublication” and supercedes all other Action Plans. \n \n  23 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 32 of 54\n \n4.  Mitigation Grants of up to $7,500 may be available to complete \nother mitigating measures. Funding of this program is \ndependent on other available funding. \n \n  Finally, at the time the Plaintiffs received their compensation grants from the Road Home \nprogram, they each signed  the Road Home Program Grant Agreement 6. (Ex. C.) The  Grant \nAgreement provides that the purpose of the grant  is “to provide  compensation for damages \nincurred by the Homeowner(s) due to Hurricanes Katrina in Augus t 2005 and/or Rita in \nSeptember 2005.” (Ex. C.)(emphasis added). \n  C.   Plaintiffs’ Claims Under the Fair Housing Act \nIn the Complaint, Plaintiffs characterize the Road Home program and the compensation \ngrants awarded to homeowners under Option 1 as a “housi ng redevelopment program.” \n(Complaint, ¶¶ 1, 2, 42, 44, 45.)  Again, as the a ction plans and Declaration of Jessie Handforth \nKome clearly demonstrate, the homeowner assistance program at issue is not a housing program, \ndoes not provide housing to anyone, d oes not involve real estate transactions, and instead only \nawards compensation grants to homeowners. (Exs. A-C; Kome Declaration, Rec.Doc. 22-2, ¶18).  \nAs for Plaintiffs’ claims under the Fair Housing Act  (FHA), they allege (1)  Defendants “denied \nhousing” to African American homeowners because of their race in violation of the Fair Housing \nAct, 42 U.S.C. § 3604 (a); (2) Defendants discriminated against African American homeown ers \nbecause of their race “in the availability of, and in the terms and conditions of, real estate-related \n                                                \n6Plaintiffs also signed a waiver of rights and liability contained in the Grant Agreement. (Grant Agreements \nfor Gloria Burns, Rhonda Dents, Almarie Ford, Daphne Jones and Edward Randolph, attached as Ex. C  in globo.) \nThe Grant Agreement was drafted and executed in Louisiana, and thus Louisiana law applies. The waiver in the \nGrant Agreement clearly, unequivocally and unambiguously provides that grant recipients will not “hold the State of \nLouisiana, United States or any other branch or agency of the state or federal government liable for their actions \nrelating to this Grant.” (Ex.C.) Instead, recipients agree to participate and resolve their disp utes through the \nresolution and appeal process provided by the Road Home program and Office of Community Development. (Ex. \nC.) Finally, the Grant Agreement provides if the homeowners attempt to take legal action, the State will have the \nright to recover at torneys’ fees and expenses. (Ex.C.) Therefore, the named Plaintiffs are barred from suing the \nState, its agents or agencies as they have waived their right to sue. (Ex. C.) See La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2046.  \n \n  24 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 33 of 54\n \ntransactions” in violation of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3605 (a); and, (3) Defendants \n“failed to administer housing -related programs and activities in a manner that affirmatively \nfurthers fair housing” in violation of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S .C.  §  3608(d), (e)(5) 7.  \n(Complaint, ¶¶ 74-76.) \nD.   The Fair Housing Act  Does Not Apply to The Road Home  Compensation \nGrant Program to Eligible Homeowners \n \nSection 3604(a) of the FHA provides that it shall be unlawful: \nTo refuse to sell or rent after the making of a bona fide offer, or to \nrefuse to negotiate for the sale or rental of, or other make \nunavailable or deny, a dwelling to any person because of race, \ncolor, religion, sex, familial status, or national origin.  \n \nLikewise, § 3605(a) of the FHA also provides: \nIt shall be unlawful for any person or other entity whose business \nincludes engaging in residential real estate -related transactions to \ndiscriminate against any person in making  available such a \ntransaction, or in the terms of conditions of such a transaction, \nbecause of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or \nnational origin.  \n \nThe issue of whether the  FHA, and in particular  §§ 3604(a) and 3605(a) of the FHA, \napplies to a compensation grant program falling under the auspices of HUD, s eems to be one of \nfirst impression.  Although HUD has funded other compensation programs using Community \nDevelopment Block Grants (i.e., the compensation and incentive grants following September 11, \n2001, and loan payments to homeowners in Grand Forks, North Dakota after flooding in 1997), \nno court has ever been called upon to determine whether plaintiffs can state a claim under the \nFHA for alleged disparate impact discrimination as a result of the  formula used to determine the \namount of compensation grants awarded to eligible individuals. (See Kome Declaration,  Rec. \nDoc. 22-2, ¶ 17.)  In addition, no Court has ever determined whether compensation grants \n                                                \n7Sections 3608(d) and 3608(e)(5) apply exclusively to HUD’s duties under the FHA, and thus do not apply \nto Defendant Rainwater. \n  25 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 34 of 54\n \nprovided by a state to a homeowner has any effect on the  “availability of housing ” or is \nconsidered a “residential real estate transaction” under the FHA. \n Generally, in order to state a claim under the FHA, “the alleged illegal actions must lead \nto discriminatory effects on the availability of housing.”  Ficken v. Golden, 2005 WL 692019 at \n*5 (D.D.C. March 24, 2005) (holding plaintiff failed to state a claim under FHA §§ 3604 (a) or \n3605(a) because defendants did not have the ability to refuse to sell or rent a dwelling and were \nnot in the real estate -related business as contemplated by the FHA ). This has been a basic and \nlongstanding requirement of this and other courts. For instance, in  Clifton Terrace Associates, \nLtd. v. United Technologies Corporation,  929 F.2d 714, 719 (D.C.  Cir. 1991), this Court held \nthat by the plain terms of § 3604(a), the FHA reaches only “discrimination that adversely affects \nthe availability of housing.”  Therefore, it is fundamental that in order for the FHA to apply, the \nchallenged conduct must impact the “availability of housing.”  \nAlthough the language of § 3604 (a) seems all encompassing, its scope is not limitless. \nCox v. City of Dallas, 430 F.3d 734, 740 (5th Cir. 2005), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1130, 126 S.Ct. \n2039, 164 L.Ed.2d 783 (2006) .  The Cox court noted that although the FHA  is meant to have a \nbroad reach, failing to enforce the clear language of the statute “pushes the FHA into a general \nanti-discrimination pose, creating rights for any discriminat ory act which impacts property \nvalues....” Cox, 430 F.3d at 746.  Instead, “while sweeping widely, the FHA does so in the \nhousing field  and remains a  housing statute —the focus of congressional concern. That the \ncorrosive bite of racial discrimination may soak into all facets of black lives cannot be gainsaid, \nbut [the FHA] targets only housing.” Cox, 430 F.3d at 746 (emphasis added).  \nIn fact, in  Cox, the plaintiff s complained that the City of Dallas violated § 3604(a) \nbecause it allowed the construction of a dump near the plaintiffs’ homes, which made it more \n  26 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 35 of 54\n \ndifficult for the plaintiffs to sell their homes and lowered the property values of their homes.  Id.  \nThe Fifth Circuit rejected the p laintiffs claims holding § 3604 (a) affords no right of action to \ncurrent homeowners claiming that the value or “habitability” of their property has decreased due \nto discrimination in the delivery of pr otective city services. Cox, 430 F.3d at 742 -43. The court \nstated: “To affect the availability of housing within the meaning of the FHA, the discriminatory \nactions must have a direct impact on plaintiffs’ ability, as potent ial homebuyers or renters, to \nlocate in a particular area or to secure housing.“   Cox, 430 F.3d at 740 , citing Cox v. City of \nDallas, 2004 WL 370242 at *6 (N.D. Tex. Feb. 24, 2004).  Indeed, to recover under § 3604 (a), \nthe plaintiffs must prove that the defendant has made unavailable or denied them dwellings; \nsection 3604(a) protects the right of individuals to live where they choose, it does not protect \nintangible interest in already -owned property, such as habitability or value.  Id.  Therefore, the \nFifth Circuit held that because the plaintiffs were already homeowners and were not denied \nhousing, the FHA did not apply to their claims. Id. \nThe Cox case is not an anomaly; cou rts have consistently held that not every act or \nconduct tangentially related to housing is actionable under the Fair Housing Act .  Jersey Heights \nNeighborhood Assn. v. Glendening, 174 F.3d 180,192 (4th Cir. 1999)(holding the State’s decision \nin selecting a location for a new highway through predominately African -American \nneighborhood did not oth erwise make housing unavailable );  see also   Edwards v. Johnston \nCounty Health Dept., 885 F.2d 1215, 1221 (4th Cir. 1989)(holding the county’s actions in issuing \npermits for establishment of substandard housing for predominately non -white migrant farm \nworkers did not make housing unavailable).   \nFor instance, the court in Jersey Heights dismissed a plaintiff neighborhood association’s \nclaim that the State of Maryland’s process and decision to build a new highway just south of its \n  27 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 36 of 54\n \nborders had a disparate adverse impact on their African American communit y. Jersey Heights, \n174 F.3d at 184 -85. Among other things, the court reasoned that the process and eventual site \nselection was too remotely related to the housing interests protected by the FHA. Jersey Heights, \n174 F.3d at 192. The court stated that situations involving racial steering by real estate agents \nprovided a closer causal link between housing and a dispu ted action than the highway selection \nsite process.  Id. Likewise, the court also found that the highway site selection did not make \nhousing “unavailable” and did not deny a dwelling to anyone.  Jersey Heights, 174 F.3d 192-93. \nThe Plaintiff neighborhood association, thus, did not state a claim under the Fair Housing Act . \nId.  \nThe Seventh Circuit reached the same result in the case of  Southend Neighborhood \nImprovement Assoc . v. St. Clair  County , 743 F.2d 1207, 1210 (7 th Cir. 1984) . The court \nconsidered plaintiff’s claim that the county’s discriminatory refusal to properly manage the \nproperties it owned damaged their interests in neighboring properties.  Id.  The court noted \nplaintiff’s claim was “quite different from most of the practices that co urts have deemed illegal \nunder § 3604 (a).” Id. The court held that since plaintiffs failed to allege that they had been \nhindered in an effort to “acquire a dwelling,” they did not state a claim un der the FHA. \nSpecifically, the court reasoned:  \nWe hold that the County’s actions here could not have affected the \navailability of housing in a manner implicating Section 3604(a) of \nthe Fair Housing Act. Section 3604(a) is designed to ensure that no \none is denied the right to live where they choose for discriminatory \nreasons, but it does not protect the intangible interests in the \nalready-owned property raised by the plaintiffs allegations.   \n \nSouthend, 743 F.2d at 1210. \nThe Seventh Circuit revisited the issue in Halprin v. The Prairie Single Family Homes of \nDearborn Park Assoc., 388 F.3d 327 (7th Cir. 2004), in which the plaintiff, a Jewish homeowner, \n  28 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 37 of 54\n \nfiled suit against the homeowners’ association and others claiming they harassed him because of  \nhis religion, by, among other things, writing an obscenity on and vandalizing his property. \nHalprin, 388 F.3d at 328. The Court noted that the plaintiffs were complaining n ot about being \nprevented from acquiring property, but about being harassed by other property owners in the \nsame subdivision. Halprin, 388 F.3d at 329.   The court held that t he plaintiff failed to state a \nclaim under  § 3604(a) of the FHA, reasoning: \nTitle VII protects the job holder as well as the job applicant, so an \nemployer who resorts to harassment to force an employee to quit is \nengaged in job discrimination within the meaning of the Act. The \nFair Housing Act contains no hint either in its language or its \nlegislative history of a concern with anything but access to \nhousing.  . . . Since the focus [of Congress] was on [minority’s] \nexclusion, the problem of how they were treated when they were \nincluded, that is, when they were allowed to own or rent homes in \nsuch areas, was not at the forefront of congressional thinking. \n \nHalprin, 388 F.3d at 329.  \nFinally, as these cases illustrate, discriminatory practices alleged by current homeowners \nwho are plaintiffs are quite unlike the discriminatory practices in other cases allowed under the \nFHA-- for example, “racial steering,” locking out of owners of one race but not another,  \nmortgage redlining, insurance redlining, exclusionary zoning-- where  the availability of housing \nfor prospective owners or tenants is implicated. See Cox, 430 F.3d 734 at 741-42. \nThe same is true in the case at bar.  In this case, the challenged Road Home compensation \ngrants were only available to homeowners as of the date of Hurricane Katrina, August 29, 2005  \nand/or Hurricane Rita, September 24, 2005 .  In fact, each named Plaintiff owned their home at \nthe time of Hurricane Katrina and continued to own their homes at the time of their application \nand award of compensation grants under the Road Home program. (Complaint, ¶¶ 13-17.)  Thus, \nPaul Rainwater and/or the LRA did not deny Plaintiffs access to housing and Plaintiffs h ave not \n  29 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 38 of 54\n \nin any way been hindered in acquiring a dwelling.  Again, home ownership was a pre-requisite to \nparticipate in the Road Home program. (Exs. A, B.) \nFurther, Option 1 of the Road Home Program was not and is not a housing program in \nthat it did not an d does not place or assist citizens in housing; instead, it simply gave citizens \ncompensation grants based on either the pre -store value of their homes or the cost to repair or \nrebuild their homes. (Exs. A, B.)  Utilizing home values in the formula to dete rmine the amount \nof grant awards is simply not enough to equate or convert Option 1 of the Road Home Program \nto a housing program.  Further,  the LRA acknowledged that the compensation grants would not \ndesigned to provide 100% of the resources the homeowne r may need to recover from the losses \nsuffered as a result of the hurricanes. (Exs. A, B.)  In addition,  grant recipients are not required \nto use the Road Home compensation grant funds to repair their houses; instead, the homeowners \nare free to use the co mpensation grants in any way they choose. (Exs. A, B.)  Therefore, \nPlaintiffs cannot assert that the lack of funding or their inability to receive larger grants denied \nthem the ability to access their houses.  In truth, the compensation grants did not guar antee any \nhomeowner that they would be able to resume living in their house as a result of receiving the \nfunds. \nE.   Option 1 of the Homeowners Assistance Program  Does  Not  Involve \nResidential Real Estate Transactions \n \nIn addition, the challenged formula for grants under Option 1 of  the Road Home program \nhas nothing to do with “residential real estate -related transactions“ as defined in § 3605 (a) or \nHUD regulations interpreting § 3605(a), 24 CFR  § 100.115, et seq.  In fact, even if the Option 1 \ngrants constitute “other financial assistance,” the compensation grants were not solely designated \nfor “purchasing, constructing, improving, repairing, or maintaining a dwell ing” and the grants \nwere not “secured by residential real estate.” 24 CFR   § 110.115 (a)(1), (a)(2).   Again, \n  30 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 39 of 54\n \ncompensation grant recipients were allowed to use the funds from the compensation grants in \nany way they chose, and were not required to use the funds to rebuild or repair their homes. (Exs. \nA, B.)   In addition, Paul Rainwater, the LRA and/or the Road Home were not in the business of \nengaging in residential real estate, especially as it concerned Option 1 grants.   Indeed, Plaintiffs \nhave not alleged Rainwater, the LRA or the Road Home sold, brokered, or appraised residential \nreal estate property. See 24 CFR § 100.115(b). \nLikewise, the list of prohibited practices under § 3605 (a)  include suc h acts such as \nfailing or refusing to provide to any person, in connection with a residential real estate -related \ntransaction, information regarding the availability of loans or financial assistance, application \nrequirements, procedures or standard for the review and approval of loans or financial assistance, \nor providing information which is inaccurate or different from that provided to others because of \nrace. 24 CFR § 100.120(b).  Other prohibited practices include using different policies, practices \nor procedures in evaluating or determining creditworthiness or determining the type of loan or \nfinancial assistance, interest rate, duration or other term of the loan/ financial assistance because \nof race.   24 CFR § 100.130(b)(1), (b)(2).  Plaintiffs have not alleged that Rainwater engaged in \nany of the se prohibited practices.  In fact, as these prohibited practices demonstrate, neither \nRainwater, the LRA and/or the Road Home were engaged the type of activities considered and \ncontemplated as being a part of  residential real estate transactions under §3605(a).  Instead, the \nformula for determining Option 1 compensation grants did not involve any real estate \ntransactions.  Thus, Plaintiffs fail to state a claim for relief under this section.  \nF.   Plaintiffs Fail to  State a  Claim Under the Fair Housing Act B ecause They \nHave Not Alleged  Proper Comparators \n \nFinally, Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under the  FHA, not only because the  FHA \ndoes not apply to a true compensation program for people who are already homeowners and \n  31 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 40 of 54\n \nbecause the compensation program did not involve real estate -related transactions, but also \nbecause Plaintiffs failed to allege sufficient  facts to maintain a discrimination claim under the \nFHA.  Importantly, Plaintiffs have utterly failed to allege that they have treated differently than \ncomparable or substantially similar white homeowners. 8  See e.g., 2922 Sherman Avenue \nTenants’ Assoc. v.  District of Columbia, 444 F.3d 673 (D.C. Cir. 2006) ; Anderson v. Zubieta, \n180 F.3d 329, 342 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (holding plaintiffs in Title VII disparate impact case must \ndemonstrate that they were treated less well than other employees who were  similarly \nsituated)(emphasis added).  In other words, Plaintiffs failed to allege that they were treated \ndifferently than white homeowners with the same or substantially the same pre -storm value \nand/or estimated costs of damage for their homes.  In fact, P laintiffs do not contest that the \nformula at issue applied the same to all applicants having the same valuation of property, i.e., \napplicants who were similarly situated.   \nFor instance, as a hypothetical, if a plaintiff’s pre -storm value of his or her hom e was \n$127,000 and estimated cost of damage to the home was $212,730, in order to maintain a \ndiscrimination claim, plaintiff s must allege that a similarly situated white homeowner (i.e., a \nwhite homeowner with a pre -storm value of $127,00 and/or an estimat ed cost of damage of \n$212,730) was treated more favorably, presumably because of their race.   Specifically in order \nto maintain a disparate impact discrimination claim under the FHA, plaintiffs must allege that a \nneutral policy caused African American hom eowners to be treated less favorably than similarly \nsituated white homeowners; again, however, the pre -storm value and/or the estimated cost of \ndamage for both white and African American homeowners must be substantially the same in \norder to make a meaningful and accurate comparison.   \n                                                \n8Rainwater also adopts by reference HUD’s argument on this issue. (HUD’s Memorandum in Support of its \nMotion to Dismiss,  Rec. Doc. 22,  pp. 42-43.) \n  32 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 41 of 54\n \nIn this case, Plaintiffs have not and cannot allege that African American and white \nhomeowners with substantially similar home values were treated differently or suffered a \nsignificantly discriminatory impact because of the ap plication of the Option 1 formula.  Instead, \nin a convoluted and strained argument, Plaintiffs allege that African American homeowners and \nwhite homeowners with the same square footage (but not the same home values) were treated \ndifferently. (Complaint, ¶¶ 53-60.)  Plaintiffs argue that “comparable homes” (meaning homes \nwith the same amount of square footage) have lower values in African American communities \nthan in predominantly white communities. (Complaint, ¶ 53.)  However, Paul Rainwater, the \nLRA and/or the Road Home are not to blame and cannot be held liable or at fault for different \nvaluation of homes with the same square footage based on location; there are many reasons and \nfactors which determine home values, none of which were developed or determine d by \nRainwater, the LRA or the Road Home and not all of which are discriminatory.   However, that \nis beyond the scope of this lawsuit.  Instead, in order to state a cognizable claim, Plaintiffs must \nallege that there was a disparate impact in the granting  of compensation awards for African \nAmerican homeowners as compared to white homeowners who owned substantially similar \nhomes (meaning homes with substantially the same property value).  Plaintiffs have utterly failed \nto allege this, and, therefore, their claims should be dismissed.  \nIV.  PLAINTIFFS HAVE NO CLAIM FOR REMEDIES UNDER THE \nHOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 1974 \n \n  In Count Two of the their Complaint, Plaintiffs allege Defendants failed to administer the \nCDBG program in a manner that affirmatively furthers fair housing, in violation of Title I of the \nHousing and Community Development Act of 1974, 42 U.S.C. § 5304  (b)(2), (HCDA).  Section \n5304(b)(2) reads: \n(b) Certification of enumerated criteria by grantee to Secretary \n  33 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 42 of 54\n \nAny grant under section 5306 of this title shall be made only if the \ngrantee certifies to the satisfaction of the Secretary that— \n \n*   *  * \n  (2) the grant will be conducted and administered in \nconformity with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C.A. § \n2000a et seq .] and the Fair Housing Act [42 U.S.C.A. § 3601 et \nseq.] and the grantee will affirmatively further fair housing. \n \nFirst, § 5304(b)(2) of the HCDA requires that a grantee make certifications that, among other \nthings, the grant will be conducted in conformity with the Civil Rights Act and Fair Housing Act.  \nPlaintiffs have not alleged that Paul Rainwater, the LRA or the Road Home failed to make these \ncertifications.  In fact, the LRA did comply with § 5304(b)(2) by making the certifications to the \nsatisfaction of HUD in the action plan s. (Kome Declaration, Rec. Doc. 22-2, ¶ 14.)(“Louisiana \nsubmitted its first action plan in early 2006 and made all required alternative certifications at that \ntime, including the certification that the state would affirmatively further fair housing. . . .   \nLouisiana later made the same certifications to obtain funds from the second and third \nappropriations.”)  HUD deemed the LRA to be fully in compliance with § 5304 (b)(2), and \nreleased the funds accordingly.  In fact, neither the LRA nor a ny other state agency, entity or \nperson involved with the grants at issue in this suit has never been cited or deemed in violation \nby HUD of these certifications.  HUD has taken no adverse action toward the State, its agencies \nor employees, in connection with the CDBG funds. \n  In any event, the sole remedies for breach of § 5304 (b)(2) are contained in  42 U.S.C. §  \n5311.  Section 5311 of the HCDA  provides that  if the Secretary of HUD fi nds a recipient of \nassistance failed to comply with, among other things, § 5304(b)(2), then the Secretary has the \nauthority to terminate, reduce, or limit the availability of the grant payments. 42 U.S.C. §  5311 \n(a).  In addition, the Secretary may also refer the matter to the  Attorney General of the United \nStates with a recommendation that civil action be instituted. 42 U.S.C. §5311 (b)(1).  Thereafter, \n  34 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 43 of 54\n \nthe Attorney General may bring a civil action in  any United States district court having venue, \nincluding an action to recover the amount of grant previously distributed and/or for injunctive \nrelief. 42 U.S.C. § 5311(b)(2).  However, these are the sole remedies for violation of the HCDA.  \nIn other words, the HCDA does not provide for a private cause of action for Plaintiffs to seek \nremedies against Paul Rainwater, the LRA or the Road Home for violations under this chapter. \nThe court in  People’s Housing Development Corporation v. City of Poughkeepsie , 425 \nF.Supp. 482 (S.D. N.Y. 1976), considered the issue of whether the HCDA allows a private cause \nof action and reached the conclusion that the HCDA did not allow such a private right of action.   \nIn People’s, the plaintiff, a  not-for-profit corporation, sued a municipality  under the HCDA  for \ncancelling its contract to establish and administer a program of acquisition, rehabilitation, and \nhome ownership grants concerning properties within the municipality.  People’s, 425 F.Supp. at \n484.  The court dismissed the suit holding the HCDA did not allow plaintiff to maintain a private \nclaim.  The court noted that there is nothing in either the legislative history  of the HCDA, nor in \nthe language of legislation itself which would militate towards a finding of congressional intent \nto supply anyone, whether a principal or secondary beneficiary, a private cause of action under \nthe Act.  People’s, 425 F.Supp. at 484.    Instead, the plain language of the statute itself speaks \nonly of the procedures and remedies which the Secretary of HUD may pursue.  Id. Therefore, the \ncourt presumes that Congress did to some degree consider the enforcement of terms and \nconditions of the Act, and obviously felt that the administrative agency should have the major, if \nnot exclusive, responsibility for compliance under the Act.  Id.   The Court concluded that the \ncase came into the directive of  National Railroad Passenger Corp.v. National Ass’n of Railroad \nPassengers, 414 U.S. 453, 94 S.Ct. 690, 38 L.Ed.2d 646 (1974): \n[W]hen legislation expressly provides a particular remedy or \nremedies, courts should not expand the coverage of the statute to \n  35 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 44 of 54\n \nsubsume other remedies.  ‘When a statute limits a thing to be done \nin a particular mode , it includes the negative of any other mode.’ \nBotany Worsted Mills v. United States, 278 U.S. 282, 289, 49 S.Ct. \n129, 132, 73 L.Ed. 379 (1929). \n \nPeople’s, 425 F. Supp. at 484. \nThe court also reasoned  that when Congress vests enforcement responsibilities in the \ngovernment agency with expertise in the particular area, agency enforcement  should be regarded \nas exclusive.  In addition, the court noted that it disfavors the fragmented approaches to the \nproblems in question which may result when the lower federal courts, lacking the agency’s \nexpertise, respond to private actions.  People’s, 425 F.Supp. at 492. Ultimately, the court \nconcluded that HUD has a wide variety of sanctions to invoke against a recipient of Act -\ngenerated funds, and there was no basis for the court to assume that th e agency would not apply \nthem in an appropriate case.  People’s, 425 F.Supp. at 493.   The Court noted: \n[T]he federal grants which sponsor these urban redevelopment \nprograms are based on detailed and comprehensive plans, which, \nwhen fully implemented over the entire course of the program may \nentail substantial alterations . . .. To view, as courts responding to \nindividual cases must, each alleged incident of discrimination in its \nown isolated context could lead to faulty conclusions. Because \nHUD has studied and approved each community’s long -term plan, \nit should be better equipped than the courts to determine whether \nthe alteration or termination of a single segment of that plan will \nhinder realization of its long -range goals as set by the \ncomprehensive plan.  Again, because the agency is well acquainted \nwith said plan, it should have a  high degree of competence in \ndiscerning whether, within the context of the overall program, an \nindividual incident represents the existence of . . . discrimination. \n \nPeople’s, 425 F.Supp. at 493.   Therefore, the court concluded that the HCDA  did not endow \nplaintiff with a private remedy.  See also Payne v. United States Department of Housing and \nUrban Development, 551 F.Supp. 1113 (S.D. Ohio 1982 )(holding a plaintiff’s sole remedy is \nthrough the procedures outlined in 42 U.S.C. § 5311).   \n  36 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 45 of 54\n \n  Indeed, the Supreme Court has been especially reluctant to imply private rights in cases \nenacted under Congress’ spending powers .  See Guilford County Community Action Program, \nInc. v. Wilson, 348 F.Supp.2d 548, 554-55 (M.D.N.C. 2004).  In Pennhurst State School & Hosp. \nv. Halderman, supra, the court explained that “[i]n legislation enacted pursuant to the spen ding \npower, the typical remedy for state noncompliance with federally imposed conditions is not a \nprivate cause of action for noncompliance but rather action by the Federal Government to \nterminate funds to the State.” Pennhurst State School & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 28, 101 \nS.Ct. 1531, 1545, 67 L.Ed.2d 694 (1981) . Since Pennhurst, the Court has remained reluctant to \nfind that spending legislation gave a private right of action.  Guilford, 348 F.Supp.2d at 555.  In \nfact, no court has found that the HCDA affords a private cause of action; instead, the exclusive \nremedy for violation of the HCDA’s provision rests with the statutory remedies contained in 42 \nU.S.C. § 5311.  \n  This case presents no reason to abrogate from the generally accepted premise that the \nthere is no private cause of action for violations of the HCDA .  In fact, the same analysis and \nconclusions are true for this suit as was the  People’s case. See also Chan v. City of New York, 1 \nF.3d 96, 101-102 (2nd Cir. 1993) (holding the HCDA did not create a private right of action to \nthe plaintiffs and, further, stating, “The mere fact that plaintif fs are intended beneficiaries of the \nstatute does not mean that Congress intended the statute to grant them a private right of action to \nsecure that benefit.”)  \nIndeed, it has been over thirty years since the  People’s case announced a prohibition of \nprivate suits under the HCDA, and Congress has done nothing to amend the HCDA  to allow for \na private cause of action.  Again, there is nothing in the legislat ive history or HCDA itself which \nwould indicate in any way that Congress intended private citizens to pursue claims individually \n  37 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 46 of 54\n \nunder the Act.  See Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, 444 U.S. 11, 100 S.Ct. 242, \n62 L.Ed.2d 146 (1979).   Finally, as the  People’s court aptly noted, HUD is in the superior \nposition to enforce the provisions of the HCDA , as HUD has hands-one, intimate knowledge of \nthe grants and Action Plans at issue in this case.  Therefore, because there  is no private cause of \naction under the HCDA,  Plaintiffs claims against Rainwater for violating  the HCDA must be \ndismissed.  \nV.  THIS CASE SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO LOUISIANA \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404 (a), Defendant seeks transf er of this matter to the United \nStates District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana,  located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, or \nalternatively, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana , located in \nNew Orleans, Louisiana.  The Court can consider this issue at any time, including before ruling \non Rainwater’s motions to dismiss.  Atfab v. Gonzalez, 597 F.Supp.2d 76 (D.D.C. 2009) , citing \nSinochem Int’l Co. , Ltd. v. Malaysia Int’l Shipping Corp. , 549 U.S. 422,  127 S.Ct. 1184, 167 \nL.Ed.2d 15 (2007).  \nA.  Standard for Change of Venue Under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) \nSection 1404(a) of Title 28 of the U.S. Code permits the Court to transfer this case to \n“any other district or division where it might have been brought” for the “convenience of parties \nand witnesses, in the interest of justice.” 28 U.S.C. § 1404 (a); Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno , 454 \nU.S. 235, 253, 102 S.Ct. 252, 70 L.Ed.2d 419 (1981) .  In analyzing a motion to transfer, a court \nmust first determine whether the action could have been brought in the district to which transfer \nis sought. Stewart Org., Inc. v. Ricoh Corp.,  487 U.S. 22, 29 , 108 S.Ct. 2239, 101 L.Ed.2d 22  \n(1988), citing Van Dusen v. Barrack, 84 S.Ct. 805, 376 U.S. 612, 613, 11 L.Ed.2d 945  (1964). \nThe Court must conduct a case-by-case analysis, balancing the private interests of the parties and \n  38 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 47 of 54\n \npublic interests such as efficiency and fairness.  Id. at 29;  Atfab v. Gonzalez, 597 F.Supp.2d 76 \n(D.D.C. 2009).  \nIn conducting its interests analysis, when, as here, the plaintiffs’ choice of  venue appears \nto relate solely on the federal agency defendant’s (HUD) presence in Washington D.C., a court \nshould carefully consider whether venue is proper.  Cameron v. Thornburgh, 983 F.2d 253, 256 \n(D.C. Cir. 1993) (holding “[c]ourts in this circuit must examine challenges to . . . venue carefully \nto guard against the danger that a plaintiff might manufacture venue in the District of Columbia. \nBy naming high go vernment officials as defendants, a plaintiff could bring a suit here that \nproperly should be pursued elsewhere.”).  This standard of close scrutiny has resulted in courts in \nthe District of Columbia invoking their transfer authority under § 1404(a) and tr ansferring cases \nto a district having a  closer connection to the parties’ dispute.   See Al-Ahmed v. Chertoff, 564 \nF.Supp.2d 16, 19 (D.D.C. 2008) (“[W]hen the  only real connection [the] lawsuit has to the \nDistrict of Columbia is that a federal agency headquartered here is charged with generally \nregulating and overseeing the [administrative] process, venue is not appropriate in the District of \nColumbia.”).  \nB.  The Middle District of Louisiana is a  More Convenient and  Appropriate \nVenue for This Suit \n \nThis case should be transferred pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1404  to the Middle District of \nLouisiana.  The LRA is domiciled by statute and locat ed in Parish of East Baton Rouge, located \nwithin the United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana (“Middle District”). \nLa. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 49:220.4 .   Defendant Paul Rainwater’s office and resi dence is in Baton \nRouge, Louisiana.  Further, most, if not all, of LRA’s witnesses and documents are located in \nBaton Rouge, Louisiana, in the Middle District. The challenged formula was designed in Baton \n  39 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 48 of 54\n \nRouge. Of the five named Plaintiffs, one currently  resides in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. \n(Complaint, ¶ 13.)      \nThe only link between this action and the District of Columbia is that the offices of co -\ndefendant, HUD, are located in the District of Columbia, along with the offices for Plaintiffs’ \nlead counsel.  There are no other ties to this District .  The events giving rise to Plaintiffs’ \nComplaint, such as the processing of their Road Home grant applications, the creation of the \nformula used in awarding the Road Home grants, and the disbursing and calculatin g of funds \nrelative to the Plaintiffs’ grant applications, all occurred in the State of Louisiana, principally in \nBaton Rouge, Louisiana, located in the Middle District.  The Middle District is a far more \nappropriate forum for this case than the District o f Columbia, and the interests of justice support \ntransfer at this initial stage of this action.  \nC.  This Action Could Have Been Brought in the Middle District of Louisiana \nThis case is governed by the general venue statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1391 , which establishes \ndefault rules for venue that apply to federal lawsuits where underlying statutes do not specify \nvenue rules.  Under  § 1391, there are three possible bases for venue for claims against federal \ngovernment officials and/or or agencies. They include: (1) where a defendant in the action \nresides; (2) the district where a substantial part of the events (or omissions) giving rise to the \nclaim occurred; or, (3) where “the plaintiff resides, if no real proper ty is involved in the action.” \nSee 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e).  \nAs a threshold matter, under § 1391, Plaintiffs clearly could have brought this case in the \nMiddle District or the Eastern District of Louisiana.   Defendant Paul Rainwater  and the LRA \nreside and are domiciled in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in the Middle District of Louisiana. Second, \na substantial part, if not all, of the events giving rise to the Plaintiffs’ claims occurred in the \n  40 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 49 of 54\n \nMiddle District of Louisiana at the offices of  the LRA.  The LRA was created by Louisiana \ngovernment and statutory law. The challenged LRA action plan and formula were created in \nBaton Rouge, Louisiana.  The Road Home program was created and implemented in Louisiana. \nPlaintiffs’ Road Home grant applic ations were processed in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in the \nMiddle District.9  The funds were distributed by the LRA in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in the \nMiddle District.  The approval and/or denials and/or appeal decisions for Plaintiff’s Road Home \ngrant applications were made in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in the Middle District.   In sum, the \nRoad Home grant program and the adjudication of Plaintiffs’ Road Home grant applications at \nissue in this action all took place in Baton Rouge, Louisiana within the Middle Dist rict. Finally, \none of five named Plaintiffs the plaintiffs reside in the Parish of Baton Rouge, located in the \nMiddle District.  No Plaintiffs reside outside the State of Louisiana, or specifically in the District \nof Columbia. Accordingly, under 28 U.S.C.  § 1391 venue is proper in the Middle District of \nLouisiana, or alternatively in the Eastern District of Louisiana.   \nD.  Private Interests Favor Transfer of  This Case to the Middle District of \nLouisiana \n \nPrivate interests favor tran sfer of this case to the Middle District of Louisiana. Such \ninterest factors typically include: (1) the parties’ choice of forum; (2) where the claim arose; (3) \nthe convenience of the parties; (4) the convenience of the witnesses, particularly if important  \nwitnesses may be unavailable to give live testimony in one of the trial districts; and , (5) the ease \nof access to sources of proof.”  Atfab, supra, 597 F.Supp.2d at 80 , citing, Montgomery v. STG \nInt'l, Inc., 532 F.Supp.2d 29, 3 2-33 (D.D.C. 2008 ).  Each of these factors weighs in favor of \ntransferring this case to the Middle District, or alternatively, the Eastern District of Louisiana.  \n                                                \n9The properties for which the grants were sought are all located in the Parish of Orleans, within the Eastern \nDistrict of Louisiana. \n  41 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 50 of 54\n \nIn this case, Plaintiffs’ choice of forum deserves little deference. Although courts \ngenerally accord deference to a plaintiff’s choice of forum, such deference is weakened when the \nforum chosen is  not the plaintiff’s home forum  and most of the relevant events occurred \nelsewhere. Id. citing Hunter v. Johanns, 517 F.Supp.2d 340, 344 (D.D.C. 2007); see also Kafack \nv. Primerica Life Ins. Co ., 934 F.Supp. 3, 6-7 (D.D.C. 1996)  (granting transfer when “the \nmaterial events that constitute the factual predicate for the plaintiff's  claims occurred” in the \ntransferee district);  See also,  Islamic Republic of Iran v. Boeing Co ., 477 F.Supp.  142, 144 \n(D.D.C. 1979) (holding plaintiff's choice of forum is accorded “diminished consideration” where \nthe forum “has no meaningful ties to the controversy and no particular interest in the parties or \nsubject matter.”).  In this case, none of the named Plaintiffs reside in the District of Columbia.  In \nfact, all five Plaintiffs reside in the State of Louisiana, either the Middle District or Eastern \nDistrict of Louisiana.10  Defendant Rainwater and the LRA are located in the Middle District. \nMost, if not all, of the  relevant events concerning Plaintiffs’ Road Home grant applications and \ngrant awards took place in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.   The only “residential” link in this litigation \nto the District of Columbia  is the office location of HUD and Plaintiffs’ counsel.   This is \ninsufficient to support litigation of this case in the District of Columbia.   \nAdditionally, the Middle District has strong connections to Plaintiffs’ case.   Primarily, \nPlaintiffs’ claim arose from alleged acts occurring in the Middle District.   The LRA was created \nand is located in the Middle District, the Road Home grant program was implemented in the \nMiddle District and Plaintiffs’ Road Home applications were processed in the Middle District.  \nFinally, the Middle District (or the Eastern District of Louisiana) is more convenient that \nthe District of Columbia. Again, the Plaintiffs are located in Louisiana.  Defendant, the LRA, and \n                                                \n10Plaintiff Gloria Burns resides in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Plaintiff Rhonda Dents resides in New Orleans, \nLouisiana; Plaintiff Almarie Ford resides in New Orleans, Louisiana; Plaintiff Daphne Jones resides in New \nOrleans, Louisiana; Plaintiff Edward Randolph resides in Luling, Louisiana. (See Complaint, ¶¶13-17.) \n  42 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 51 of 54\n \nits employees are all located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Documents and materials concerning \nPlaintiff’s Road Home grant applications are located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in the Middle \nDistrict.  \nE.   Public Interests Favor Transfer to the Middle District of Louisiana \nPublic interests also favor transfer of this case to the Middle District, or alternatively, the \nEastern District of Louisiana.   Public interest considerations include: the transferee district’s \nfamiliarity with governing laws, relative congestion of the calendars of the potential transferee \nand transferor courts, and local interests in deciding local controve rsies at home.  Atfab, supra. \n597 F.Supp.2d at 83, citing Liban v. Churchey Group II, L.L.C., 305 F.Supp.2d 136, 143 (D.D.C. \n2004).  The Middle District of Louisiana is presumed to be equally familiar with the federal laws \ngoverning the Plaintiffs’ claims.  Atfab, 597 F.Supp.2d at 83 .  There is no evidence Plaintiffs’ \ncase would proceed more quickly in the District of Columbia. Finally, the Middle District has a \nstronger local interest in resolving this matter. 11  Plaintiffs are challenging the LRA’s formula \nand action plan, both created in Louisiana; the LRA’s alleged decision s affected all Louisiana \ncitizens - no citizens of the District of Columbia were involved; the controversy stems from the \nimpact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on the State of Louisiana; and the controversy relates to \nthe valuation of properties all of which are located in the State of Louisiana. Simply stated, there \nare no significant ties to the District of Columbia and this District has no local interest in \nresolving this case. See Abusadeh v. Chertoff, 2007 WL 2111036, at *8 (D.D.C., July 23, 2007) \n(“[T]here is a local interest in having localized controversies decided at home.”)   The case \n                                                \n11To determine whether a controversy is local in nature, courts can consider a “wide variety” of factors, \nincluding, but not limited to, where the challenged decision was made, whether the decision directly affected \ncitizens of the transferee state; the location of the contro versy; whether the issue involved federal constitutional \nissues or local property laws; whether the controversy involved state law issues, whether the controversy has \nnational significance and whether there was personal involvement by a District of Columbia official.  Atfab, supra at \n84, citing Otay Mesa Property L.P. v U.S. Department of Interior, 584 F.Supp.2d 122, 126 (D.D.C. 2008). \n  43 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 28-1    Filed 05/05/09   Page 52 of 54\n \ninvolves Louisiana residents and parties. It involves  Louisiana Recovery Authority and the \nLouisiana Road Home Program.  It involves  Louisiana properties.  It is a Louisiana controversy \nthat would be better resolved by a court in the State of Louisiana.   Accordingly, Defendant’s \nmotion to transfer this action to the Unite d States District Court for the Middle District of \nLouisiana (or alternatively, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana) \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) should be granted.  \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n/s/ Renee Culotta         \nA.J.

Plaintiffs have standing to challenge HUD’s unlawful conduct............................6 \nB.  The case is not moot............................................................................................12 \nC.  Neither the sovereign immunity of the United States nor the Eleventh \nAmendment immunity of Louisiana bars this suit...............................................15 \n1.  Congress has waived the immunity of the United States in actions, \nlike this one, that seek relief other than money damages........................16 \n2.  This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims \nagainst Rainwater because they are claims against a state officer \nfor prospective relief from unlawful acts.................................................19 \na.  Ex parte Young applies because Plaintiffs seek no funds \nfrom the state treasury..................................................................20 \nb.  The decision in Coeur d’Alene is inapplicable............................23 \nc.  There can be no Eleventh Amendment immunity for \nviolations of the HCDA...............................................................25 \nII.  Defendants’ motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim should be denied.................25 \nA.  Rainwater is subject to the requirements of both the Fair Housing Act and \nthe HCDA............................................................................................................26 \n1.  This Court must reject Rainwater’s disingenuous argument that the \nRoad Home program is beyond the reach of the Fair Housing Act.........26 \n2.  Plaintiffs may enforce 42 U.S.C. § 5304(b) against Rainwater \nthrough a direct right of action or under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.....................30 \na.  Congress intended the HCDA to be directly enforceable \nthrough an implied right of action...............................................30 \nb.  Plaintiffs may enforce the HCDA against Rainwater under \n42 U.S.C. § 1983..........................................................................34 \nB.  The Administrative Procedure Act does not preclude Plaintiffs’ claims \nagainst HUD.........................................................................................................36 \n1.  Title VIII and the HCDA directly confer a right of action to \nchallenge HUD’s discriminatory conduct................................................37 \n \n-i-   \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 3 of 77\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n(continued) \nPage \n \n2.  Plaintiffs’ claims against HUD are reviewable under 5 U.S.C. \n§ 704.........................................................................................................39 \na.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy for HUD’s \ndiscriminatory conduct other than a remedy from HUD.............39 \nb.  Plaintiffs challenge final agency action.......................................44 \n3.  The “discrete agency action” requirement does not preclude review \nof HUD’s actions in this case...................................................................44 \na.  HUD’s conduct is properly reviewed pursuant to § 706(2).........45 \nb.  Even if HUD’s actions can only be reviewed pursuant to \n§ 706(1), the “discrete agency action” requirement is met \nhere...............................................................................................47 \nC.  Plaintiffs’ Complaint alleges sufficient facts to state a claim against both \nHUD and Rainwater for violations of Title VIII and the HCDA........................50 \n1.  HUD’s motion to dismiss must be denied because Plaintiffs allege \nsufficient facts to establish violations of Title VIII and the HCDA........51 \n2.  Rainwater’s motion to dismiss must be denied because Plaintiffs \nhave alleged sufficient facts to state a Title VIII disparate impact \nclaim.........................................................................................................56 \nD.  The individual Plaintiffs did not waive their right to sue....................................58 \nIII.  Rainwater’s motion to transfer should be denied because Rainwater has failed to \ncarry his heavy burden of establishing that this Court should disturb Plaintiffs’ \nchoice of forum................................................................................................................60 \nA.  Rainwater has not demonstrated that the private interests of the parties and \nwitnesses weigh in favor of transferring this case...............................................60 \nB.

The Road Home program is the largest single housing \nredevelopment plan in United States history. \nThe Plaintiffs—two fair housing organizations and a proposed class of approximately \n20,000 African American homeowners—allege that the Road Home program awards smaller \ngrants to African American families than to white families with comparable homes that suffered \nsimilar damage.  This disparity leaves African American families with a larger gap between the \ngrant amount and the cost to rebuild their homes, disproportionately harming African Americans \nwho seek to return to their homes in New Orleans.  Plaintiffs allege that by developing, \nimplementing, and overseeing the Road Home program, both the U.S. Department of Housing \nand Urban Development (“HUD”) and Paul Rainwater, Executive Director of the Louisiana \nRecovery Authority (“LRA”), have violated the nondiscrimination and affirmative fair housing \nprovisions of Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, see 42 U.S.C. §§ 3604, 3605, and 3608 \n(the “Fair Housing Act” or “Title VIII”), and the Housing and Community Development Act of \n1974, see 42 U.S.C. § 5304 (the “HCDA”). \nHUD and Rainwater have moved to dismiss the Complaint for lack of subject-matter \njurisdiction and failure to state a claim; and Rainwater also moves to transfer this action from \nthis Court to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana.  For the \nreasons stated herein, defendants’ motions should be denied. \nBACKGROUND \nThe CDBG Disaster Recovery Grant program is a $19.7 billion program for which \nCongress allocated Community Development Block Grant (“CDBG”) funds for necessary \n1 \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 13 of 77\n \nexpenses related to disaster relief, long-term recovery, and rebuilding in the areas in the Gulf of \nMexico most affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005.  Compl. ¶¶ 5, 33-36, Dkt. 1 (Nov. \n12, 2008).  Congress created and funded the Disaster Recovery Grant program through three \nappropriations statutes passed in 2005, 2006, and 2007.  See Department of Defense, Emergency \nSupplemental Appropriations to Address Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, and Pandemic \nInfluenza Act, 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-148, 119 Stat. 2680, 2779-81 (Dec. 30, 2005) (the “2005 \nAct”) (Ex. A); Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on \nTerror, and Hurricane Recovery, 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-234, 120 Stat. 418, 472-73 (June 15, \n2006) (the “2006 Act”) (Ex. B); Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2008, Pub. L. No. \n110-116, 121 Stat. 1295, 1343-44 (Nov. 13, 2007) (the “2007 Act”) (Ex. C).1   \nThe first two statutes appropriated a combined $16.7 billion to the five affected states—\nLouisiana, Mississippi, Texas, Florida, and Alabama—for activities authorized under the CDBG \nstatute.  See 2005 Act, 119 Stat. at 2779-81 ($11.5 billion appropriation); 2006 Act, 120 Stat. at \n472-73 ($5.2 billion appropriation).  From the overall $16.7 billion appropriation in the 2005 and \n2006 Acts, HUD allocated $10.41 billion to Louisiana for disaster recovery expenses.  See 71 \nFed. Reg. 7666, 7666 (Feb. 13, 2006) (Ex. D) (allocating $6.21 billion of the $11.5 billion from \nthe 2005 Act to Louisiana); 71 Fed. Reg. 63,337, 63,338 (Oct. 30, 2006) (Ex. E) (allocating $4.2 \nbillion of the $5.2 billion from the 2006 Act to Louisiana).  Congress passed the third \nappropriations statute in late 2007, authorizing an additional $3 billion for supplemental CDBG \ngrants to Louisiana.  See 2007 Act, 121 Stat. at 1343-44.  Accordingly, $13.41 billion of the total \namount appropriated by Congress for the CDBG Disaster Recovery Grant program has been \nallocated to Louisiana.   \n                                                 \n1 For the Court’s convenience, the relevant CDBG Disaster Recovery Grant statutes and \nregulations are attached as exhibits A through G. \n \n2\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 14 of 77\n \nThe Disaster Recovery Grant program is governed by the general statutory and regulatory \nframework that governs regular CDBG funds.2  See 2005 Act, 119 Stat. at 2779-80; 2006 Act, \n120 Stat. at 472-73.  In administering the Disaster Recovery Grant program, HUD may waive \ncertain CDBG program requirements if requested by a state, but may not waive requirements \nrelating to fair housing, nondiscrimination, labor standards, and the environment.  See 2005 Act, \n119 Stat. at 2780; 2006 Act, 120 Stat. at 472-73. \nThe appropriations statutes include a reporting and monitoring framework that \nsupplements the regular CDBG program requirements.  The 2005 Act and 2006 Act provide that \n“prior to the obligation of funds each State shall submit a plan to the Secretary [of HUD] \ndetailing the proposed use of all funds, including criteria for eligibility and how the proposed use \nof all funds . . . will address long-term recovery and restoration of infrastructure.”  2005 Act, 119 \nStat. at 2780; 2006 Act, 120 Stat. at 473; see also 42 U.S.C. § 5304(a)(1).  HUD’s implementing \nregulations require that grantees submit an “action plan” to fulfill this obligation.  See 71 Fed. \nReg. at 7669; 71 Fed. Reg. at 63,338-39; 72 Fed. Reg. 70,472, 70,472-73 (Dec. 11, 2007) \n(Ex. F).  In addition to detailing the intended uses of all grant funds, the action plan must include \na number of certifications,3 including assurances that the grantee will comply with the Fair \nHousing Act and will affirmatively further fair housing.  71 Fed. Reg. at 7671; 71 Fed. Reg. at \n                                                 \n2 The regular CDBG program provides annual block grants to local and state governments for \nhousing and housing-related development activities.  42 U.S.C. § 5301.  The primary objective \nof the CDBG program is to develop “viable urban communities[] by providing decent housing \nand a suitable living environment and expanding economic opportunities, principally for persons \nof low and moderate income.”  Id. § 5301(c).  The statutory requirements for the regular CDBG \nprogram are established in Title I of the HCDA.  Id. §§ 5301-5318. \n3 “Certification” is defined in HUD regulations to mean: “A written assertion, based on \nsupporting evidence, that must be kept available for inspection by HUD, by the Inspector \nGeneral of HUD, and by the public.”  24 C.F.R. § 91.5. \n \n3\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 15 of 77\n \n63,339; 72 Fed. Reg. at 70,472.  HUD is required to review and approve these certifications \nbefore it obligates any grant funds.  42 U.S.C. § 5304(b). \nThe Louisiana Recovery Authority (“LRA”) is a Louisiana state agency created to \nadminister funds for recovery from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, including CDBG Disaster \nRecovery Grant funds.  Defendant Paul Rainwater is the LRA’s Executive Director.  Compl. \n¶ 19.  From its total of $13.41 billion in Disaster Recovery Grant funds, the LRA designated \napproximately $11 billion for housing programs known collectively as the Road Home program.  \nId. ¶ 41.  The largest Road Home component is the Homeowner Assistance Program,4 which \nprovides rebuilding assistance to homeowners whose homes were destroyed or suffered major \ndamage as a result of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.  Id. ¶¶ 43-44. \nHomeowners who agree to use Road Home funds to rebuild or repair their homes are \neligible for grants of up to $150,000.  Id. ¶¶ 45-46.  The grant amount is calculated using the \nlower of two baseline values: the home’s pre-storm or the cost of damage to the home.  Id. ¶ 47.  \nConsistent with the statutory and regulatory framework described above, the LRA proposed and \ndeveloped the Road Home grant formula and the details of the Road Home program in \nconsultation with HUD and subject to HUD’s ongoing approval and oversight.  Id. ¶¶ 49-51. \nThe requirement that Road Home grant awards not exceed the pre-storm value of the \nhome has a discriminatory disparate impact on African Americans.  Id. ¶¶ 52-60.  Homes in \npredominantly African American communities had lower values than those in white \ncommunities, even when the condition, style, and quality of the homes are comparable.  Id. \n¶¶ 53-54.  As a result, African American homeowners have been more likely than whites to \nreceive a Road Home grant that is based on the pre-storm value of their home rather than on the \n                                                 \n4 This memorandum will refer to the Road Home Homeowner Assistance Program as the \n“Road Home” program for brevity. \n \n4\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 16 of 77\n \ncost of damage and are, therefore, more likely than white homeowners to have a gap between \ntheir rebuilding resources and the cost to rebuild.  Id. ¶¶ 55-60. \nAccordingly, the operation of this program violates both Title VIII (42 U.S.C. §§ 3604, \n3605, and 3608) and the HCDA (42 U.S.C. § 5304).  Id. ¶ 74-77.  Section 3604(a) of Title VIII \nmakes it unlawful to “make unavailable or deny” housing to any person because of race.  42 \nU.S.C. § 3604(a).  Section 3605(a) of Title VIII makes it unlawful to discriminate on the basis of \nrace in the availability, terms, or conditions of residential real estate-related transactions.  Id. \n§ 3605(a).  And § 3608(e)(5) of Title VIII requires HUD and recipients of federal funds to \n“administer the programs and activities relating to housing and urban development in a manner \naffirmatively to further” fair housing.5  Id. § 3608(e)(5).  Finally, § 5304(b)(2) of the HCDA \nrequires that the use of all CDBG funds be conducted in a manner that “affirmatively further[s] \nfair housing.”  Id. § 5304(b)(2).  Plaintiffs allege that by designing, implementing, and \noverseeing a program that has a disparate impact on African American families as compared to \nwhite families, both HUD and Rainwater violated the anti-discrimination provisions of § 3604(a) \nand § 3605(a), and failed to fulfill their affirmative obligations under § 3608(e)(5) and \n§ 5304(b)(2). \nThe discriminatory disparities in the application of the Road Home formula give rise to \nthis action for declaratory and injunctive relief to end the discriminatory operation of the Road \n                                                 \n5 Plaintiffs’ Complaint alleges that the defendants violated § 3608(d) in addition to \n§ 3608(e)(5) of the Fair Housing Act.  Compl. ¶ 76.  As HUD notes, § 3608(d) and § 3608(e)(5) \nimpose an identical obligation to administer housing programs “in a manner affirmatively to \nfurther” fair housing policies.  Defendant HUD’s Motion to Dismiss 36, Dkt. 22 (Mar. 6, 2009) \n(“HUD Br.”).  This memorandum will refer only to § 3608(e)(5) in discussing Plaintiffs’ \nallegations that the defendants violated their affirmative obligations under both § 3608(d) and \n§ 3608(e)(5) of the Fair Housing Act. \n \n5\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 17 of 77\n \nHome program and to direct the Defendants to develop and apply a new nondiscriminatory grant \nformula.   \nARGUMENT \nI.  Defendants’ motions to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction should be \ndenied. \nHUD and Rainwater each move to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack \nof subject-matter jurisdiction.  HUD argues (1) that Plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge \nthe Road Home formula because Plaintiffs’ injuries will not be redressed by a favorable \njudgment; (2) that Plaintiffs’ claims are moot as to those Disaster Recovery Grant funds that \nHUD has already obligated to Louisiana; and (3) that Plaintiffs’ Complaint fails to allege a \nwaiver of sovereign immunity.  Defendant HUD’s Motion to Dismiss 20-31, Dkt. 22 (Mar. 6, \n2009) (“HUD Br.”).  Rainwater separately argues that this Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction \nbecause the Eleventh Amendment bars Plaintiffs’ claims against Rainwater.  Defendant Paul \nRainwater’s Motion to Dismiss and Motion to Transfer 3-18, Dkt. 28 (May 5, 2009) (“Rainwater \nBr.”).  None of these arguments has merit and each should be rejected. \nIn evaluating a motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, this Court must \nconstrue all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.  Vanover v. Hantman, 77 F. Supp. 2d \n91, 98 (D.D.C. 1999).  The Court may rely on matters outside the pleadings only if the facts are \nundisputed or if the Court provides Plaintiffs an opportunity to discover the facts necessary to \nestablish jurisdiction.  Herbert v. Nat’l Acad. of Scis., 974 F.2d 192, 198 (D.C. Cir. 1992). \nA.  Plaintiffs have standing to challenge HUD’s unlawful conduct. \nThe jurisdiction of federal courts is limited to actual cases or controversies between \nproper litigants.  U.S. Const. art. III, § 2.  Constitutional standing requires that a party have \nsuffered an actual or threatened injury, which may be fairly traced to the challenged action and \n \n6\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 18 of 77\n \nwhich is “likely to be redressed by a favorable decision” of the court.  Fla. Audubon Soc’y v. \nBentsen, 94 F.3d 658, 661 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (en banc) (quoting Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. \nAm. United for Separation of Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 472 (1982)).  HUD argues that \nPlaintiffs cannot show that a favorable judgment would redress the harm caused by HUD’s \napproval and continued oversight of the discriminatory Road Home grant formula.  See HUD Br. \n19-27.  The Court should reject this argument, because Plaintiffs’ Complaint easily establishes \nthat the alleged harms would be redressed by a favorable judgment. \nIn order to satisfy the redressability requirement, Plaintiffs must establish that it is likely, \nas opposed to merely speculative, that a favorable decision by this Court will redress the injury \nsuffered.  America’s Cmty. Bankers v. FDIC, 200 F.3d 822, 827 (D.C. Cir. 2000); Fla. Audubon \nSoc’y, 94 F.3d at 663-64 (“Redressability examines whether the relief sought, assuming that the \ncourt chooses to grant it, will likely alleviate the particularized injury alleged by the plaintiff.”).  \nPlaintiffs are not required to prove to a certainty that the alleged injuries will be redressed by a \nfavorable decision.  See W. Va. Ass’n of Cmty. Health Ctrs., Inc. v. Heckler, 734 F.2d 1570, 1575 \n(D.C. Cir. 1984) (“[O]nce appellants demonstrated that they would qualify to receive . . . funds, \nthey need not shoulder the additional burden of demonstrating that they are certain to receive \nfunding.”). \nHere, Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to demonstrate that a favorable ruling would \nlikely redress the injuries alleged in this suit.  Any order from this Court that invalidates the \nRoad Home grant formula would compel Rainwater to develop, and HUD to evaluate and \napprove, a new housing recovery formula that would treat African American homeowners fairly \nin the New Orleans redevelopment process.  HUD disputes that such an order would remedy \nPlaintiffs’ injuries by downplaying its role in the Road Home program.  But the Complaint \n \n7\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 19 of 77\n \nalleges, and the statutory scheme provides, that HUD is responsible for the administration, \nfunding, and supervision of federal low-income housing programs, including the regular CDBG \nprogram and the CDBG Disaster Recovery Grant program.  Compl. ¶¶ 18, 33-37.  All grantees, \nincluding Rainwater, must submit an action plan to HUD that explains the intended uses of the \nfunds and promises to comply with the Fair Housing Act.  HUD must approve this action plan \nbefore disbursing any funds.  Id. ¶¶ 37-38; 42 U.S.C. § 5304(b); 71 Fed. Reg. at 7671; 71 Fed. \nReg. at 63,339; 72 Fed. Reg. at 70,472; 73 Fed. Reg. 46,312, 46,314 (Aug. 8, 2008) (Ex. G).  \nThe existing Road Home grant formula was proposed and developed in consultation with HUD, \nwas approved by HUD as a condition of the distribution of grant funds, and is subject to HUD’s \ncontinuing oversight and approval.  Compl. ¶¶ 49-51. \nPlaintiffs therefore seek an order setting aside HUD’s approval of the discriminatory \nformula and requiring HUD to oversee the development of a new, nondiscriminatory formula.  \nThe D.C. Circuit has found in the analogous context of agency rule promulgation that a court \norder requiring an agency to vacate a rule and develop a new one would redress the claims of \nplaintiffs who had challenged that rule.  See, e.g., America’s Cmty. Bankers, 200 F.3d at 828-29 \n(“Where an agency rule causes the injury, the redressability requirement may be satisfied . . . by \nvacating the challenged rule and giving the aggrieved party the opportunity to participate in a \nnew rulemaking, the results of which might be more favorable to it.”); Motor & Equip. Mfrs. \nAss’n v. Nichols, 142 F.3d 449, 457-58 (D.C. Cir. 1998); cf. Ctr. for Auto Safety v. Nat’l \nHighway Traffic Safety Admin., 793 F.2d 1322, 1334 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (redressability prong \nsatisfied where a favorable decision could trigger a series of penalties that would force third \nparties to take specific actions).  Plaintiffs’ claims are therefore sufficient to establish standing.   \n \n8\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 20 of 77\n \nHUD relies on Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737 (1984), and Simon v. Eastern Kentucky \nWelfare Rights Organization, 426 U.S. 26 (1976), to argue that Plaintiffs’ likelihood of obtaining \nredress is speculative.  The plaintiffs in Allen and Simon, however, requested relief that could not \nbe ordered by the court, because the relief depended upon the independent actions of third parties \nthat were not parties to the litigation.  See Allen, 468 U.S. at 743-46; Simon, 426 U.S. at 41-42.  \nIn particular, both cases involved challenges to favorable tax treatment that was alleged to affect \nthe third party’s incentives.  See Allen, 468 U.S. at 743-36; Simon, 426 U.S. at 33.  The D.C. \nCircuit has explained that both cases establish the principle that “speculative claims dependent \nupon the actions of third parties do not create standing for the purposes of establishing a case or \ncontroversy under Article III.”  Gettman v. Drug Enforcement Admin., 290 F.3d 430, 435 (D.C. \nCir. 2002) (discussing Allen and Simon); see also Action Alliance of Senior Citizens of Greater \nPhila. v. Heckler, 789 F.2d 931, 938 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (“In the [Simon] line of cases, causality \nand remediability were doubtful because the plaintiffs’ injury resulted from the action of third \nparties not before the court . . . .”).6  No such problem arises in this case, as Plaintiffs need not \nrely on any indirect effect on a third party.  All of the parties necessary to accord the relief that \nPlaintiffs seek—HUD and Rainwater—are defendants before this Court. \n                                                 \n6 The lower court decisions relied upon by HUD feature complainants with similarly flawed \narguments.  See US Ecology, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of the Interior, 231 F.3d 20, 24-25 (D.C. Cir. \n2000) (action challenging decision of federal agency to rescind the sale of land to third party not \nbefore the court); Univ. Med. Ctr. of S. Nev. v. Shalala, 173 F.3d 438, 439-40 (D.C. Cir. 1999) \n(holding that the plaintiff did not have standing where relief depended upon whether third parties \nnot involved in the litigation would opt to make retroactive payments to appellants); Freedom \nRepublicans v. FEC, 13 F.3d 412, 414, 417-19 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (action against the FEC to block \nfunding for the Republican National Convention because of alleged discrimination by the \nRepublican Party); see also Linda R. S. v. Richard D., 410 U.S. 614, 614-16 (1973) (action by \nmother seeking to challenge a local prosecutor’s decision to decline prosecution of a “deadbeat” \nfather who failed to pay child support). \n \n9\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 21 of 77\n \nIn addition, HUD’s authority over Rainwater through HUD’s direct grant-making and \nregulatory authority distinguishes this case from the more attenuated remedial proposals at issue \nin Allen and Simon.  The D.C. Circuit has consistently upheld plaintiffs’ standing to challenge \nfederal agency decisions in similar circumstances.  See, e.g., Ctr. for Auto Safety, 793 F.2d at \n1334 (holding that consumer organizations had standing to challenge automobile fuel economy \nstandards because the claimed injury—the lack of fuel-efficient vehicles—would be redressed by \na ruling that required the agency to adopt regulations mandating increased fuel efficiency); \nAction Alliance, 789 F.2d at 936-39 (holding that plaintiffs had standing where the requested \nrelief—a court order requiring that agency-specific regulations be modified to be compatible \nwith government-wide regulations—would redress the alleged injury of organizational \nplaintiffs). \nHUD contends that it does not in fact have authority to impose fair housing conditions on \ngrant recipients, arguing that it has a “limited role in approving CDBG funds.”  HUD Br. 22-23 \n(citing Declaration of Jessie Handforth Kome Submitted in Support of Defendant HUD’s Motion \nto Dismiss ¶¶ 3, 9, 13, Dkt. 22, Attachment (Mar. 3, 2009), (“Kome Decl.”)).  This argument not \nonly is foreclosed by the mandatory statutory and regulatory scheme described above, but also \nwas rejected unanimously by the Supreme Court over thirty years ago in Hills v. Gautreaux, 425 \nU.S. 284 (1976).  In Gautreaux, HUD argued that no remedy could be ordered for HUD’s \napproval of discriminatory local housing practices in Chicago on the ground that the “practical \noperation” of many HUD-funded programs is “in a significant degree under local control.”  See \nBr. for the Pet’r 29-34, Hills v. Gautreaux, No. 74-1047 (filed Nov. 8, 1975), available at 1975 \nWL 173594.  The Supreme Court rejected this argument, holding that the district court could \norder a remedy requiring HUD to impose and enforce civil rights conditions on the use of federal \n \n10\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 22 of 77\n \nhousing funds.  Gautreaux, 425 U.S. at 301-06 (“[A] metropolitan area relief order directed to \nHUD . . . would have the same effect on the suburban governments as a discretionary decision by \nHUD to use its statutory powers to provide the respondents with alternatives to the racially \nsegregated Chicago public housing system . . . .”); see also, e.g., NAACP v. HUD, 817 F.2d 149, \n155, 157 (1st Cir. 1987) (Breyer, J.) (“Clearly, HUD possesses broad discretionary powers to \ndevelop, award, and administer its grants and to decide the degree to which they can be shaped to \nhelp achieve Title VIII’s goals.”); Shannon v. HUD, 436 F.2d 809, 820-23 (3d Cir. 1970); \nNAACP, Boston Chapter v. Kemp, 721 F. Supp. 361, 367 (D. Mass. 1989) (“[HUD’s] control of \ncurrent and future [CDBG] grant funds gives the agency leverage to remedy past and current \nnoncompliance with fair housing goals.”).7 \nHUD also argues that the possibility a favorable judgment will result in replacing the \ndiscriminatory formula with a particular alternative—a cost-of-damage formula—is too \nspeculative to establish standing.  HUD Br. 24.  But the relief Plaintiffs seek does not depend on \nthe Court’s ordering use of a particular formula.  Rather, Plaintiffs simply ask the Court to direct \nHUD to rescind approval of the discriminatory formula currently in use and replace it with a \nnondiscriminatory one.  See Compl. p.17 (requesting that the Court order HUD and Rainwater \n“to cease immediately their violation of Plaintiffs’ rights, and to remedy the invidious effects of \ntheir violations by recalculating Road Home homeowner grants in a nondiscriminatory manner”).  \nThe Complaint’s reference to the cost-of-damage calculation is simply an illustration of one way \nof recalculating grant awards to remedy racial disparities in the existing formula.  See id. ¶ 60.  \nThis claim suffices to establish standing, because Plaintiffs need only show that a favorable \n                                                 \n7 Should the Court be inclined to credit the assertions in the Kome Declaration regarding the \nnature of HUD’s authority over Rainwater and other state grantees, see Kome Decl. ¶¶ 3, 9, 13, \nPlaintiffs reserve the right to seek expedited discovery regarding those jurisdictional facts.  See \nHerbert, 974 F.2d at 198. \n \n11\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 23 of 77\n \njudgment would compel HUD to devise an alternative, nondiscriminatory calculation.  See CC \nDistribs., Inc. v. United States, 883 F.2d 146, 151 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (holding that plaintiff had \nstanding to challenge a Department of Defense contracting decision because the requested \nrelief—requiring the defendant to conduct re-competitions and cost comparison studies—would \nredress plaintiffs’ claims, not by guaranteeing that they would be awarded the contracts, but by \ngiving them the opportunity to compete for the contracts); W. Va. Ass’n., 734 F.2d at 1574 \n(holding that plaintiff community health centers who challenged a federal grant decision “need \nnot demonstrate that they would actually receive the additional funding” in order to show \nredressability, and instead it sufficed that plaintiffs alleged the denial of the “opportunity to \ncompete for . . . increased funding”). \nBecause a favorable judgment will likely redress Plaintiffs’ injuries, this Court should \ndeny HUD’s motion to dismiss for lack of standing. \nB.  The case is not moot. \nHUD next asserts that the Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction because Plaintiffs’ \nclaims are moot.  HUD Br. 27-28.  This assertion ignores that Plaintiffs’ claims can be satisfied \nwithout requiring HUD to reallocate or obligate any additional federal funds.  Plaintiffs need not \nask the Court to order the expenditure of federal funds that were previously dedicated to \nhomeowners other than Plaintiffs, or the reallocation of funds already obligated to other states.  \nSee City of Houston v. HUD, 24 F.3d 1421, 1424-27 (D.C. Cir. 1994); W. Va. Ass’n, 734 F.2d at \n1577 & n.8; cf. Population Inst. v. McPherson, 797 F.2d 1062, 1081 (D.C. Cir. 1986).  Rather, \nPlaintiffs ask the Court to order HUD to use its existing authority to force Rainwater to conform \nthe Road Home program with federal law.  Thus, no part of this action is moot.   \nContrary to HUD’s assertion, the mootness principles of City of Houston and West \nVirginia have no relevance in this action.  See HUD Br. 27-28.  In City of Houston, HUD had \n \n12\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 24 of 77\n \nreduced Houston’s CDBG grant for fiscal year 1986 by $2.6 million and reallocated the $2.6 \nmillion to other grantees.  24 F.3d at 1424-25.  Houston claimed its grant could not be reduced \nwithout a hearing and sought a court order compelling HUD to increase its grant by $2.6 million.  \nId.  But because HUD had already contractually obligated all of its 1986 CDBG appropriations \nbefore the action was filed, the court lacked the power to order the further expenditure of those \nfunds.  Id. at 1426-27.  As the D.C. Circuit explained, “when an appropriation has lapsed or has \nbeen fully obligated, federal courts cannot order the expenditure of funds that were covered by \nthat appropriation.”  Id. at 1424; see id. at 1428 (rejecting the city’s assertion that its grant could \nbe increased from funds recouped from other grantees).   \nSimilarly, in West Virginia, an association of community health centers challenged a \nfederal agency’s allocation formula for the federal Primary Care Block Grant and sought an \norder compelling the agency to increase West Virginia’s 1983 block grant.  734 F.2d at 1572-73.  \nThe action was deemed moot, however, because plaintiffs “concede[d] that all FY83 PCBG \nfunds have been awarded by the Secretary to various recipients.”  Id. at 1577.  Thus, in both City \nof Houston and West Virginia, plaintiffs’ injuries could only be redressed by a court order \ncompelling a federal agency to increase a state’s grant from a source of funds that had already \nbeen fully obligated.  See City of Houston, 24 F.3d at 1426.    \nHere, Plaintiffs’ claims can be redressed without a court order compelling HUD to spend \nany additional CDBG “funds that were covered” by the 2005, 2006, and 2007 Acts, because the \ncourt may order HUD to exercise its extant authority to impose fair housing conditions on \nRainwater’s continued operation of the Road Home program.  Id. at 1424, 1426.  In particular, \nHUD has the authority to require Rainwater to use the funds that HUD has already disbursed and \nobligated to LRA (though not yet awarded to particular homeowners), to (1) award Road Home \n \n13\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 25 of 77\n \ngrants based on a nondiscriminatory formula to homeowners who have not yet received grants, \nand (2) recalculate awards for homeowners who previously received grants under the \ndiscriminatory formula.  42 U.S.C. §§ 5304, 5311; see also Kemp, 721 F. Supp. at 367 (“[T]he \nfact that the 1977-81 funds have been disbursed does not deprive HUD of all leverage over its \ngrantees.  Its control of current and future grant funds gives the agency leverage to remedy past \nand current noncompliance with fair housing goals.”) (citing 42 U.S.C. §§ 5304, 5311 and Davis \nv. HUD, 627 F.2d 942, 945 (9th Cir. 1980) (Kennedy, J.) (rejecting HUD’s contention that an \naction under the HCDA was “moot because block grant funds have been disbursed to the City \nwhich has already expended most of them”)).  Thus, each class plaintiff can obtain relief in the \nabsence of a court ordering the expenditure of additional federal funds.  Accordingly, the “fully \nobligated” standard of City of Houston does not apply here.  See 24 F.3d at 1424.8       \nEven if the Court were to apply City of Houston, it still could not conclude that Plaintiffs’ \naction is moot.  Under City of Houston, an action seeking the expenditure of appropriated funds \nmay become moot “when an appropriation has lapsed or has been fully obligated.” Id. (emphasis \nadded).  Here, the relevant appropriations have neither lapsed nor been fully obligated.  As HUD \nconcedes, Congress expressly stated that the CDBG funds at issue here shall not lapse.  HUD Br. \n28 n.10; 2005 Act, 119 Stat. at 2779-80; 2006 Act, 120 Stat. at 472; 2007 Act, 121 Stat. at 1343.  \nAnd because HUD has obligated only a portion of the relevant CDBG funds to the Road Home \nprogram, with $1 billion yet to be obligated to Louisiana, HUD clearly has not fully obligated all \nof the relevant funds.  Compare City of Houston, 24 F.3d at 1427 (granting summary judgment \nto HUD where it was undisputed that funds had been contractually obligated in their entirety at \n                                                 \n8 Because the relief Plaintiffs seek does not require the expenditure of additional federal \nfunds, Plaintiffs need not, as HUD suggests, “seek a preliminary injunction preventing the \nagency from disbursing those funds.”  HUD Br. 28.   \n \n14\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 26 of 77\n \nleast six months prior to initiation of suit), with Kome Decl. ¶ 25 (“Of the remaining funds that \nCongress has appropriated for disaster recovery, HUD has not yet obligated $1,000,000,000 to \nLouisiana.”).  Until all of the relevant appropriated funds have been obligated, this Court retains \nthe authority to “order the expenditure of funds covered by that appropriation.”  City of Houston, \n24 F.3d at 1424; see also Nat’l Ctr. for Mfg. Scis. v. Dep’t of Defense, 199 F.3d 507, 509-10 \n(D.C. Cir. 2000) (holding that an action was not moot where the plaintiff’s claim could be \nsatisfied with unobligated funds from the same appropriations act as the challenged provision); \ncf. W. Va. Ass’n, 734 F.2d at 1577 (holding an action moot since all funds had already been \nobligated); Hegna v. Snow, No. 03-01479, 2005 WL 3276307, at *3 (D.D.C. Sept. 27, 2005) \n(Kennedy, J.) (same).9  Therefore, even if City of Houston applies, this action is not moot.10 \nFinally, even if, arguendo, the Court were to accept HUD’s flawed argument—supported \nby not a single case in this Circuit or elsewhere—that Plaintiffs’ action is moot because a portion \nof the relevant funds has been obligated already, Plaintiffs’ challenge to HUD’s continuing \napproval and oversight of LRA’s discriminatory policies in the Road Home program is clearly \nnot moot, as HUD itself concedes.  HUD Br. 28 n.11; see also Dynalantic Corp. v. Dep’t of \nDefense, 115 F.3d 1012, 1015 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (citing City of Houston, 24 F.3d at 1428). \nC.  Neither the sovereign immunity of the United States nor the Eleventh \nAmendment immunity of Louisiana bars this suit. \nBoth HUD and Rainwater move to dismiss this action for lack of subject-matter \njurisdiction on sovereign immunity grounds.  HUD argues that Plaintiffs’ claims should be \n                                                 \n9 Should the Court deem City of Houston applicable, Plaintiffs reserve the right to seek \nexpedited discovery to support a possible motion for a preliminary injunction to preserve the \nremaining unobligated funds. \n10 Because these unobligated funds originated from the same source that HUD used to fund \nthe Road Home program, there can be no concern that an injunction ordering HUD to use these \nfunds would “constitute monetary damages rather than specific relief” under the waiver of \nsovereign immunity in 5 U.S.C. § 702.  See City of Houston, 24 F.3d at 1428; infra Part I.C.1.   \n \n15\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 27 of 77\n \ndismissed, because Plaintiffs did not allege a waiver of sovereign immunity in the Complaint.  \nHUD Br. 29-31.  Rainwater argues that Plaintiffs’ suit is barred by the Eleventh Amendment to \nthe Constitution.  Rainwater Br. 3-18.  For the reasons discussed below, neither argument \nprovides a basis for dismissal here. \n1.  Congress has waived the immunity of the United States in actions, like \nthis one, that seek relief other than money damages. \nHUD argues that the Court lacks jurisdiction because the Complaint does not expressly \nallege a waiver of sovereign immunity by the United States.  See HUD Br. 29-31.  Plaintiffs have \nproperly invoked sufficient bases for this Court’s subject-matter jurisdiction, and HUD’s motion \nto dismiss on this ground should therefore be denied. \nHUD acknowledges that Congress has waived the immunity of the United States in any \naction “seeking relief other than money damages.”  5 U.S.C. § 702; see HUD Br. 29-31.  HUD \nnonetheless argues that because Plaintiffs do not specifically cite § 702 in the Complaint, the \nComplaint should be dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.  See HUD Br. 29-31.  But \n§ 702 is not an independent grant of jurisdiction.  Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99, 105-07 & \nn.6 (1977).  Rather, subject-matter jurisdiction is conferred on this Court by 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, \n1343(a)(3), 1343(a)(4), and 42 U.S.C. § 3613(a), as Plaintiffs’ Complaint properly states.  See \nCompl. ¶ 8; see also 14A Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure § 3659, at 51 (3d ed. \n1998 & Supp. 2009) (“[I]t is now quite clear that plaintiffs seeking specific relief are given the \nright to sue the government in federal court by the Administrative Procedure Act but the subject \nmatter jurisdiction basis is the general federal question statute.”).  Plaintiffs’ Complaint thus \nmeets the requirement that a pleading contain “a short and plain statement of the grounds for the \ncourt’s jurisdiction.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(1). \n \n16\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 28 of 77\n \nNor is it necessary for Plaintiffs’ Complaint to specifically invoke the right of judicial \nreview provided by § 702.  A complaint is simply required to give the defendant fair notice of \nthe plaintiff’s claim and the grounds on which it rests, and HUD’s response makes clear that it is \non notice of Plaintiffs’ claims.  See Alvarez v. Hill, 518 F.3d 1152, 1157 (9th Cir. 2008) (“The \ncontention that his complaint’s omission of a citation to RLUIPA precludes [the plaintiff] from \nadvancing legal arguments based on that statute is entirely meritless. . . .  [The plaintiffs’] \ncomplaint and subsequent filings provided appellees with ‘fair notice’ of that claim, even though \nthe statute was not cited in the complaint itself.” (citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. \n544, 562 (2007))); 2 Moore’s Federal Practice §§ 8.03[3] n.19, 8.04[3] n.13 (3d ed. 1997 & \nSupp. 2009) (citing cases); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(e) (“Pleadings must be construed so as to \ndo justice.”).11 \nPlaintiffs have brought this action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to enforce \nHUD’s statutory mandate to ensure its grantees comply with federal anti-discrimination laws.  \nSee Compl. ¶¶ 7, 9.  Accordingly, on its face, this action seeks “relief other than money \ndamages” that squarely fits within the § 702 waiver of sovereign immunity.  Plaintiffs’ action \nseeks specific relief in the form of an order setting aside HUD’s approval of the discriminatory \nformula and requiring HUD to oversee the development of a new, nondiscriminatory formula. \nSee Compl. ¶ 17.  Binding precedent has long recognized that actions for specific relief, even \nwhere they would result in the payment of money due, fall within the sovereign immunity waiver \nof§ 702.  See, e.g., Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 893-901 (1988) (adopting reasoning \nin Maryland. Dep’t of Human Res. v. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 763 F.2d 1441 (D.C. Cir. \n                                                 \n11 If this Court believes that the lack of specific citation to § 702 in the Complaint deprives \nthe Court of subject-matter jurisdiction, Plaintiffs will amend the Complaint to so plead.  See \nFed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(1)(A); see also 6 Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure § 1483 & \nn.15, at 587-88. \n \n17\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 29 of 77\n \n1985)).  These decisions have explained that “money damages represent compensatory relief, an \naward given to a plaintiff as a substitute for that which has been lost; specific relief in contrast \nrepresents an attempt to restore to the plaintiff that to which it was entitled from the beginning.”  \nAmerica’s Cmty. Bankers, 200 F.3d at 829; see Bowen, 487 U.S. at 893-901.  As the D.C. Circuit \nhas emphasized, “[w]here a plaintiff seeks an award of funds to which it claims entitlement \nunder a statute, the plaintiff seeks specific relief, not damages.”  America’s Cmty. Bankers, 200 \nF.3d at 829; Nat’l Ass’n of Counties v. Baker, 842 F.2d 369, 373 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (release of \nsequestered funds was not money damages as plaintiffs “are seeking funds to which a statute \nallegedly entitles them rather than money in compensation for the losses they may have suffered \nby virtue of the withholding of those funds”); see also Esch v. Yeutter, 876 F.2d 976, 983-85 \n(D.C. Cir. 1989) (finding farmers’ claim for a redetermination of their entitlement to a federal \nsubsidy in compliance with the subsidy statutes did not seek “money damages”).12   \nIn Bowen, the state of Massachusetts sought to enjoin the Department of Health and \nHuman Services from refusing to reimburse the state for Medicaid expenditures under an \nimproper interpretation of its statutory mandate.  Bowen, 487 U.S. at 889.  The Court explained \nthat the relief Plaintiffs sought—a reversal of the decision to disallow the reimbursements—was \nnot “damages” but rather an adjustment in the size of the federal grant due.  Id. at 893.  The \nCourt held that § 702’s waiver of sovereign immunity permitted the action, because the suit \nsought “to enforce the statutory mandate itself, which happens to be one for the payment of \n                                                 \n12 Hubbard v. Administrator, EPA, 982 F.2d 531 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (en banc), similarly \nrecognized this distinction between specific relief and monetary damages.  The court held that a \nsuit for back pay as compensation for the refusal to hire constituted “money damages,” as the \nharm suffered was the lost opportunity to perform the job and, thus, the specific relief sought was \ninstatement.  Id. at 532, 534.  The court observed that back pay might well be properly \ncategorized as specific relief where a plaintiff had been hired and worked for a year without \nbeing paid, as in that circumstance the money he had “a right to receive in exchange for his labor \nmight well be the very thing that was taken from him.”  Id. at 534 n.4.   \n \n18\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 30 of 77\n \nmoney.”  Id. at 900.  Thus, the plaintiff sought the “very thing” to which the state was entitled.  \nId. at 910.    \nHere, Plaintiffs seek to obtain relief in the form of an order setting aside HUD’s approval \nof the discriminatory formula and requiring HUD to oversee the development of a new, \nnondiscriminatory formula. This would provide to Plaintiffs the specific thing to which they \nwere originally entitled.  HUD apparently concedes as much, characterizing the relief Plaintiffs \nseek as “prospective relief,” not money damages.  See HUD Br. 21.  Accordingly, this action is \nauthorized to proceed under the United States’s waiver of sovereign immunity in § 702. \nBecause § 702 waives the sovereign immunity of the United States in this action and \nbecause Plaintiffs’ Complaint gives HUD ample notice of the basis of Plaintiffs’ claims, the \nmotion to dismiss on sovereign immunity grounds should be denied. \n2.  This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims \nagainst Rainwater because they are claims against a state officer for \nprospective relief from unlawful acts. \nRainwater moves to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction on \nthe ground that the Eleventh Amendment bars Plaintiffs’ suit.  See Rainwater Br. 3-18.  The \nEleventh Amendment poses no obstacle to the relief sought here.  As the Supreme Court held in \nEx parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), “[a] federal court is not barred by the Eleventh \nAmendment from enjoining state officers from acting unconstitutionally, either because their \naction is alleged to violate the Constitution directly or because it is contrary to a federal statute or \nregulation that is the supreme law of the land.”  Vann v. Kempthorne, 534 F.3d 741, 749 (D.C. \nCir. 2008) (quoting 17A Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure § 4232).  This case is a \n \n19\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 31 of 77\n \nstraightforward application of that doctrine: Plaintiffs seek an injunction against a state officer, \nRainwater, alleging that his actions violate several federal statutes.13 \na.  Ex parte Young applies because Plaintiffs seek no funds from \nthe state treasury. \n  Rainwater’s leading argument against application of Ex parte Young rests on the \nirrelevant and undisputed fact that the LRA as an entity—and not Rainwater alone—designed the \nformula at issue and administers the Road Home Program.  Rainwater Br. 5-7, 11-12.  According \nto Rainwater, this means that the state “is the real party in interest.”  Id. at 4.  But the Supreme \nCourt rejected this very argument in Ex parte Young.  There, Young was the attorney general of \nMinnesota and, notwithstanding that the policy in question was set out by the state legislature, \nthe Court held that if Young’s actions violated federal law, “[t]he state has no power to impart to \nhim any immunity from responsibility to the supreme authority of the United States.”  Ex parte \nYoung, 209 U.S. at 159-60.  The D.C. Circuit rejected this very argument just last year, as it \nexplained: “the Cherokee Nation argues that tribal sovereign immunity bars the suit against its \nofficers because the requested relief really runs against the tribe itself.  This is reminiscent of the \nlosing argument in Ex parte Young.  The argument is no more persuasive a century later.”  Vann, \n534 F.3d at 750 (citation omitted).14 \n                                                 \n13 To the extent that Rainwater suggests, without any authority, that Plaintiffs must “address \nthe issue of sovereign immunity in their Complaint” and “invoke the doctrine of Ex parte Young \nin their Complaint,” to invoke the subject-matter jurisdiction of this Court, see Rainwater Br. 7 \n(citation omitted), the Court should reject this argument for the same reasons given above.  See \nsupra Part I.C.1.  The basis for federal jurisdiction is the same against Rainwater as against \nHUD, and adequately pleaded in the Complaint. \n14 Rainwater further misinterprets Ex parte Young by arguing that “the instant case can easily \nbe distinguished from the facts of Ex parte Young where a state official allegedly violated state \nlaw.”  Rainwater Br. 12.  Ex parte Young involved no violation of state law, but rather an \ninjunction preventing the attorney general from enforcing a state law alleged to contravene \nfederal law.  Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. at 132.  Here, as in Ex Parte Young, the Plaintiffs seek to \nenjoin a state officer from violating federal law. \n \n20\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 32 of 77\n \n  As even Rainwater ultimately acknowledges, the immunity provided by the Eleventh \nAmendment is limited to protection against remedies requiring payment of state funds.  \nRainwater Br. 4-5 (admitting that the Eleventh Amendment’s “sovereign immunity bars suits \nwhose direct outcome will diminish the public treasury through the award of retroactive \ndamages” (citing Ford Motor Co. v. Dep’t of Treasury, 323 U.S. 459, 464 (1945))).  Put another \nway, if the relief the Plaintiffs sought required payment from funds in the state treasury, the \nEleventh Amendment would apply regardless of whether Rainwater or the state was named as \nthe defendant.  As the relief the Plaintiffs seek here relates to the use of federal funds and will \nnot require payment of any state monies, there is no basis to invoke the immunity provided by \nthe Eleventh Amendment. \n  In his argument that Ex parte Young is inapplicable, Rainwater cites only two cases in \nwhich the relief sought was unavailable under Ex parte Young, and in each case the plaintiffs \nsought payment of money from the state treasury.  See Rainwater Br. 10-16 (citing Edelman v. \nJordan, 415 U.S. 651 (1974); Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265 (1986)).15  This is no coincidence.  \nIn Edelman, relied on heavily by Rainwater, the Supreme Court noted repeatedly that the \nplaintiffs sought an expenditure of state funds to compensate them for a past loss.  The Court \nemphasized that the requested relief “in practice resemble[d] a money judgment payable out of \nthe state treasury,” id. at 666, and that it “require[d] payment of state funds, not as a necessary \nconsequence of compliance in the future with a substantive federal question determination, but as \n                                                 \n15 In three of the other cases Rainwater cites in that section, the plaintiffs were permitted to \nrely on Ex parte Young.  Verizon Md., Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm’n of Md., 535 U.S. 635, 645-48 \n(2002); Quern v. Jordan, 440 U.S. 332, 347-49 (1979); Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 288-\n90 (1977).  In two others, the case turned not on the relief sought but on other issues not relevant \nhere.  Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 73-76 (1996) (comprehensive remedial \nscheme); Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 106 (1984) (Ex parte Young \ninapplicable to violations of state law). \n \n21\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 33 of 77\n \na form of compensation.” Id. at 668.  Similarly, in Papasan, on which Rainwater also heavily \nrelies, the Court stressed that the state would be required “to use its own resources to take the \nplace of the [lost trust] corpus or the lost income from the corpus.”16  Papasan, 478 U.S. at 281. \nIn an effort to invoke the Eleventh Amendment, Rainwater seeks to characterize the relief \nthe Plaintiffs seek as retrospective merely because Plaintiffs seek to correct decisions that were \nmade in the past.  Rainwater Br. 15-16.  But that is not nearly enough to invoke the Eleventh \nAmendment’s immunity.  In Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267 (1977), the Supreme Court \naffirmed an award of compensatory and remedial education programs to remedy past de jure \nschool segregation.  Although the segregation had originated in the past, the relief sought was \nnot tantamount to an award of damages from the state treasury and was therefore labeled \nprospective: “That the programs are . . . ‘compensatory’ in nature does not change the fact that \nthey are part of a plan that operates prospectively.”  Id. at 290.  In fact, even if the order had “a \ndirect and substantial impact on the state treasury,” id. at 289—something Rainwater has not \nshown here—it was nonetheless permissible because of its prospective nature. \nMilliken thus reinforces the distinction between the various types of prospective relief Ex \nparte Young authorizes and the raids on state treasuries Edelman prohibits.  As one court put it, \nin Milliken the Supreme Court “solidified the distinction it has drawn between prospective and \nretroactive relief in setting the boundaries of the Eleventh Amendment’s bar on suits against a \nstate in federal court.  The distinction accommodates an individual’s right to obtain relief in \nfederal court from state officials’ unconstitutional actions with the states’ right not to have their \n                                                 \n16 Even Rainwater’s own argument based on Idaho v. Coeur d’Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 \nU.S. 261 (1997), though misguided in several ways as discussed below, see infra Part I.C.2.b, \nrecognizes the importance of a direct impact on state funds as a critical part of the analysis.  See \nRainwater Br. 17-18. \n \n22\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 34 of 77\n \npublic coffers depleted with large retroactive damage awards.”  Santiago v. N.Y. State Dep’t of \nCorr. Servs., 945 F.2d 25, 29 (2d Cir. 1991).17 \nThis case falls comfortably on the “prospective” side of that line.  Plaintiffs seek to \ncorrect grant calculations awarded pursuant to a formula that relies upon discriminatory housing \nconditions and to ensure any future use of federal funds will not promote such discrimination.  \nLouisiana’s public coffers face no risk of a retroactive damage award, because the relief can be \nawarded entirely through grants of federal funds.  See 2005 Act, 119 Stat. at 2779-81; 2006 Act, \n120 Stat. at 472-73; 2007 Act, 121 Stat. at 1343-44; 71 Fed. Reg. at 7666 (allocating funds from \nthe 2005 Act to Louisiana); 71 Fed. Reg. at 63,337 (allocating funds from the 2006 Act to \nLouisiana).  Should Plaintiffs prevail on the merits, a remedial order would therefore be not a \nraid on the Louisiana state treasury but instead a directive to correct the Road Home program’s \ndiscriminatory formula using only federal funds.  Such relief is unequivocally prospective. \nb.  The decision in Coeur d’Alene is inapplicable. \nPerhaps recognizing that Plaintiffs here seek prospective relief, Rainwater argues that \n“even prospective relief . . . [is] barred if the relief sought is the functional equivalent of relief \notherwise barred by the Eleventh Amendment and ‘special sovereignty interests’ are implicated.”  \nRainwater Br. 16 (citing Idaho v. Coeur d’Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U.S. 261, 281 (1997)).  \nRainwater nowhere describes, however, what form of relief barred by the Eleventh Amendment \nis the “functional equivalent” of the relief sought here.  Nor is Rainwater’s analogy to Coeur \nd’Alene availing.  In Coeur d’Alene, the plaintiffs sought to tread on the state’s core sovereign \n                                                 \n17 If Rainwater’s statement that “this lawsuit does not challenge the constitutionality of Mr. \nRainwater’s actions,” Rainwater Br. 10, seeks to distinguish between statutory and constitutional \nclaims, it is misguided.  Ex parte Young applies equally to statutory and constitutional claims.  \nSee, e.g., Verizon Md., 535 U.S. at 645 (applying Ex parte Young to a claim that state officers \nviolated the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and a Federal Communications Commission \nruling). \n \n23\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 35 of 77\n \npower: the power to exercise control over the lands and waters of the state.  As the Supreme \nCourt described it, “[t]he requested injunctive relief would bar the State’s principal officers from \nexercising their governmental powers and authority over the disputed lands and waters,” and \n“diminish, even extinguish, the State’s control over a vast reach of lands and waters long deemed \nby the State to be an integral part of its territory.”  Coeur d’Alene, 521 U.S. at 282.  Requiring \nRoad Home grants to be administered in a way that is fair to African American homeowners is a \nfar cry from extinguishing a state’s control over its own sovereign territory. \nNor can Coeur d’Alene be stretched to apply to this case.  The D.C. Circuit has declined \nto “extend Coeur d’Alene beyond its ‘particular and special circumstances,’ which involved the \nprotection of a State’s land.” Vann, 534 F.3d at 756 (citation omitted).  Instead, it “le[ft] it for the \nSupreme Court to decide whether to add additional sovereign interests to the core concerns \ndiscussed in Coeur d’Alene.”  Id.18  Against this controlling precedent, the best authority \nRainwater can muster for his tortured analogy is a single case in which the plaintiffs sought to \nexercise control over state funds “where Congress has expressly enacted that states may allocate \nsuch funds as they please.”  Barton v. Summers, 293 F.3d 944, 951 (6th Cir. 2002).  But Barton \nsimply echoes the point highlighted above: the Eleventh Amendment acts as a bar when the \nrelief sought constitutes a raid on the state’s general revenues.  Put simply, Coeur d’Alene \naffords the same protection to a state’s land that Edelman provides to its treasury.  See Vann, 534 \n                                                 \n18 See also 17A Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure § 4232 & n.41 (“Lower \ncourts have been reluctant to use the special state sovereignty interest rationale to limit Ex Parte \nYoung relief.”) (collecting cases); Hill v. Kemp, 478 F.3d 1236, 1259 (10th Cir. 2007) \n(recognizing that “the Supreme Court in Verizon Maryland clarified that the courts of appeals \nneed not (and should not) linger over the question whether ‘special’ or other sorts of sovereign \ninterests are at stake before analyzing the nature of the relief sought.”); Cardenas v. Anzai, 311 \nF.3d 929, 938 (9th Cir. 2002) (“Applying the Coeur d’Alene exception to bar this action because \nit affects the state’s interest in providing for the public health and welfare would allow the Coeur \nd’Alene exception to swallow the Ex parte Young rule.”). \n \n24\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 36 of 77\n \nF.3d at 756 (“Coeur d’Alene closely aligns with earlier decisions holding that Ex parte Young \ncannot be used to gain access to the State’s treasury.”). \nIn short, this case fits comfortably within the Ex parte Young doctrine, and Rainwater’s \nEleventh Amendment argument is meritless. \nc.  There can be no Eleventh Amendment immunity for violations \nof the HCDA. \nIn addition, as to Plaintiffs’ claims arising under the HCDA, Rainwater can assert no \nEleventh Amendment immunity at all.  Under 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-7, “A State shall not be \nimmune under the Eleventh Amendment . . . for a violation of . . . the provisions of any . . . \nFederal statute prohibiting discrimination by recipients of Federal financial assistance.”  As \ndiscussed in more detail infra Part II.A.1, the HCDA prohibits discrimination by recipients of \nCDBG grants.  See 42 U.S.C. §§ 5304(b)(2), 5306, 5309(a).  Rainwater can therefore assert no \nimmunity for claims under that section. \n* * * \nNeither defendant has raised a persuasive argument that this Court lacks subject-matter \njurisdiction to hear Plaintiffs’ claims.  The motions to dismiss for lack of subject-matter \njurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) should be denied. \nII.  Defendants’ motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim should be denied. \nBoth Defendants also move to dismiss the Complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to \nstate a claim.  Rainwater argues that the Fair Housing Act does not apply to the Road Home \nprogram, and that Plaintiffs may not enforce the HCDA in court.  Rainwater Br. 25-31, 33-38.  \nHUD argues that its conduct is unreviewable under the Administrative Procedure Act.  HUD Br. \n31-40.  In addition, both Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient facts to state \na violation of Title VIII.  Rainwater Br. 31-33; HUD Br. 40-45.  \n \n25\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 37 of 77\n \nFor the reasons discussed below, Plaintiffs’ claims are reviewable by this Court and are \nadequately pleaded. \nA.  Rainwater is subject to the requirements of both the Fair Housing Act and \nthe HCDA. \n  Rainwater moves to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) on the \ngrounds that (1) the Road Home program is not subject to the requirements of the Fair Housing \nAct, and (2) Plaintiffs cannot enforce the requirements of the HCDA.  Rainwater Br. 25-31, 33-\n36.  Rainwater’s first argument is frivolous: his own certifications demonstrate the applicability \nof the Fair Housing Act to the Road Home program, and Plaintiffs have alleged an effect on the \navailability of housing sufficient to establish the applicability of Title VIII in any event.  \nRainwater’s second argument must likewise be rejected, because Plaintiffs have a clear right to \nenforce the HCDA in this action. \n1.  This Court must reject Rainwater’s disingenuous argument that the \nRoad Home program is beyond the reach of the Fair Housing Act. \nRainwater first argues that the Fair Housing Act does not apply to the Road Home \nprogram because it is a “compensation grant program,” and not a “housing program.”  Rainwater \nBr. 19-30.  This is an astonishing argument for Rainwater to make, given that he was required to \ncertify to HUD—before receiving any CDBG Disaster Recovery Grant funds under the \nappropriations acts—that all of those funds would be administered in compliance with the Fair \nHousing Act.  Even apart from Rainwater’s certification, the case law makes clear that the Road \nHome program is subject to the requirements of the Fair Housing Act. \nThe statutes that funded the CDBG Disaster Recovery Grant program authorized \nappropriations “for activities authorized under title I of the Housing and Community \nDevelopment Act of 1974.”  2005 Act, 119 Stat. at 2779-80; see also 2006 Act, 120 Stat. at 472 \n(same).  The HCDA provides block grants to state and local governments for housing and \n \n26\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 38 of 77\n \nhousing-related development activities.  42 U.S.C. §§ 5301, 5305(a) (enumerating a list of \neligible housing and housing-related activities).  The HCDA further specifies that the use of \ngrant funds “will be conducted and administered in conformity with . . . the Fair Housing \nAct . . . .”  Id. § 5304(b)(2).  Because the appropriations acts expressly limited the use of Disaster \nRecovery Grant funds to housing-related activities authorized under the HCDA, and because the \nHCDA requires that all funds be spent in conformity with the Fair Housing Act, it is hard to \nconceive how Rainwater can claim the Road Home program is not subject to the Fair Housing \nAct. \nRainwater’s argument is made even more incredible by the requirement that he agree to \ncomply with the Fair Housing Act as a condition of receiving the funds.  The HCDA provides \nthat prior to the receipt of grant funds, grantees must (among other requirements) certify that the \ngrantee will comply with the Fair Housing Act and will affirmatively further fair housing.  Id. \n§ 5304(b)(2).  To effectuate these statutory requirements, HUD has promulgated a detailed \nregulatory framework governing a grantee’s use of CDBG Disaster Recovery Grant funds.  That \nframework requires any state receiving Disaster Recovery Grant funds to certify both that the \nstate “will affirmatively further fair housing,” and that “the grant will be conducted and \nadministered in conformity with . . . the Fair Housing Act . . . and implementing regulations.”  71 \nFed. Reg. at 7671 (regulations applying to the 2005 Act); see also 71 Fed. Reg. at 63,339 \n(providing that all regulations that apply to the 2005 Act will also apply to the 2006 Act); 72 \nFed. Reg. at 70,472 (providing that all program requirements that apply to the 2005 and 2006 \nActs will also apply to the 2007 Act); 73 Fed. Reg. at 46,314 (reconsidering and reauthorizing \nthe certification requirements applicable to all three appropriations). \n \n27\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 39 of 77\n \nIn other words, as a condition of receiving the CDBG Disaster Recovery Grant funds that \nRainwater used to establish the Road Home program, Rainwater was required to certify to HUD \nthat all uses of the funds would be conducted in conformity with the Fair Housing Act.  For \nRainwater now to contend that the Fair Housing Act does not apply is hard to reconcile with, and \nindeed calls into question, Rainwater’s prior certifications that he would comply with this law.  \nSee United States ex rel. Anti-Discrimination Ctr. of Metro N.Y., Inc., v. Westchester County, No. \n06-2860, 2009 WL 455269, at *2, *13-16 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 24, 2009) (rejecting Westchester \nCounty’s motion for summary judgment in a qui tam action in which the relators alleged that the \nCounty falsely certified that it would use CDBG grant funds in compliance with the Fair \nHousing Act). \nIn any event, Rainwater’s assertion that the Fair Housing Act does not apply to the Road \nHome program because it is a “compensation program” is incorrect.  The stated purpose of the \nRoad Home program is to rebuild hurricane-affected communities, and the challenged Road \nHome formula provides grants to homeowners who agree to use the funds to rebuild or repair \ntheir homes.  Compl. ¶¶ 44-46.  Each of the individual Plaintiffs alleges that he or she has been \nunable to complete home repairs, and in some cases has been unable to return to the dwelling at \nall, because of the discriminatory disparate impact of the Road Home formula.  Compl. ¶¶ 61-65.  \nThese allegations are sufficient to state a claim that Rainwater has “ma[de] unavailable or \nden[ied]” housing to African American homeowners in violation of § 3604(a).  This Court has \nheld that § 3604(a) must be read broadly to reach any conduct that hinders access to housing on \nthe basis of race.  See, e.g., Nat’l Fair Hous. Alliance, Inc. v. Prudential Ins. Co., 208 F. Supp. \n2d 46, 56 (D.D.C. 2002) (“[T]he broad, general language—reflected in phrases such as \n‘otherwise make unavailable or deny’—was intended to be flexible enough to cover multiple \n \n28\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 40 of 77\n \ntypes of housing-related transactions.”); see also Nat’l Cmty. Reinvestment Coal. v. Accredited \nHome Lenders Holding Co., 573 F. Supp. 2d 70, 76-77 (D.D.C. 2008) (“NCRC”); Nat’l Cmty. \nReinvestment Coal. v. Novastar Fin., Inc., No. 07-0861, 2008 WL 977351, at *2-3 (D.D.C. Mar. \n31, 2008).  Because the Road Home formula operates to deny black families sufficient rebuilding \nassistance compared to white families, it hinders access to housing on the basis of race and is \ncomfortably within the scope of conduct prohibited by § 3604(a). \nRainwater argues that § 3604(a) applies only to prospective homeowners, and does not \napply to Plaintiffs here because they were already homeowners before Hurricane Katrina.  This \nargument is incorrect.  This Court has held that § 3604(a) applies to conduct that puts existing \nhomeowners at risk of losing their property.  See 2922 Sherman Ave., 444 F.3d at 682; \nHargraves v. Capital City Mortgage Corp., 140 F. Supp. 2d 7, 20 (D.D.C. 2000).  Rainwater also \nargues that § 3604(a) does not prohibit conduct, unrelated to housing, that may diminish home \nvalues on the basis of race.  Rainwater Br. 26-29 (citing Jersey Heights Neighborhood Ass’n v. \nGlendening, 174 F.3d 180, 192 (4th Cir. 1999), and Cox v. City of Dallas, 430 F.3d 734, 740 (5th \nCir. 2005)).  Even assuming this to be correct, Plaintiffs do not allege that the Road Home \nprogram diminishes the value of their homes—they allege that the grant formula has made \nhousing unavailable to them because of their race.  Compl. ¶¶ 44-46, 61-65. \nFinally, Rainwater asserts in a footnote that the requirement to affirmatively further fair \nhousing in 42 U.S.C. § 3608(e)(5) applies only to HUD and not to state grantees.  See Rainwater \nBr. 25 n.7.  This argument is foreclosed by the terms of the HCDA as well as more than three \ndecades of case law.  See Otero v. N.Y. City Hous. Auth., 484 F.2d 1122, 1133-34 (2d Cir. 1973) \n(describing “the affirmative duty placed on the Secretary of HUD by [§ 3608(e)(5)] and through \nhim on other agencies administering federally-assisted housing programs”); Langlois v. Abington \n \n29\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 41 of 77\n \nHous. Auth., 234 F. Supp. 2d 33, 73 (D. Mass. 2002) (“When viewed in the larger context of \nTitle VIII, the legislative history, and the case law, there is no way—at least, none that makes \nsense—to construe the boundary of the duty to affirmatively further fair housing as ending with \nthe Secretary [of HUD].” (citing Otero, 484 F.2d at 1133-34)); Resident Advisory Bd. v. Rizzo, \n425 F. Supp. 987, 1015-17 (E.D. Pa. 1976) (holding that the affirmative obligation to promote \nfair housing in § 3608(e)(5) “applies not only to HUD but applies as well to other governmental \nagencies administering federally financed housing programs”). \nAccordingly, this Court should reject Rainwater’s attempt -- after certifying to HUD that \nhe would administer the Road Home program in compliance with the Fair Housing Act -- to \nevade his obligation to comply with that statute. \n2.  Plaintiffs may enforce 42 U.S.C. § 5304(b) against Rainwater through \na direct right of action or under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  \n  Rainwater concedes that the Road Home program is subject to the HCDA, but contends \nthat Plaintiffs have no right of action to enforce § 5304(b).  See Rainwater Br. 33-38.  This \nargument should be rejected, because Plaintiffs may enforce § 5304(b) directly through an \nimplied right of action or, in the alternative, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \na.  Congress intended the HCDA to be directly enforceable \nthrough an implied right of action. \nCourts weigh four factors in determining whether plaintiffs have an implied right of \naction to enforce a statute: (1) whether the plaintiff is part of the class for whose benefit the \nstatute was enacted; (2) whether the legislature intended to create a private remedy; (3) whether a \nprivate remedy is consistent with the purposes of the legislation; and (4) whether the cause of \naction is not founded on an area traditionally relegated to state law.  Tax Analysts v. IRS, 214 \nF.3d 179, 185-86 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (citing Cort v. Ash, 422 U.S. 66, 78 (1975)).  This Court has \nexplained that of these factors, “the most important consideration is whether the legislature \n \n30\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 42 of 77\n \nintended to create a private right of action.”  Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Employees v. Hawley, 543 F. \nSupp. 2d 44, 47 (D.D.C. 2008) (quoting Dial A Car, Inc. v. Transp., Inc., 132 F.3d 743, 744 \n(D.C. Cir. 1998)).  Moreover, “there is no need for [the Court] to ‘trudge through all four of the \nfactors when the dispositive question of legislative intent has been resolved.’”  Nat’l Postal \nProf’l Nurses v. U.S. Postal Serv., 461 F. Supp. 2d 24, 32 n.1 (D.D.C. 2006) (quoting Merrill \nLynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. v. Curran, 456 U.S. 353, 388 (1982)).  \nHere, Congress’s intent to provide a remedy for violations of the HCDA is apparent from \nthe legislative history.  The House Report to the 1987 amendments to the HCDA expressly states \nthis intent:            \nThe assisted housing programs have been created specifically to \nassure lower income households have greater access to decent and \naffordable housing than their limited incomes would otherwise \npermit.  The Committee intends, and has always intended, that \napplicants and tenants who are adversely affected by violations of \nthese statutory provisions should have a cause of action to enforce \nthe statute in federal court. . . .  [T]he Committee wishes to clarify \nits long-standing intention in favor of private enforcement.  \n \nH.R. Rep. No. 100-122(I), at 53 (1987), as reprinted in 1987 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3317, 3369 \n(emphasis added).  Rainwater’s assertion that there is nothing in the legislative history to \ndemonstrate Congress’s intent to provide a right to sue, Rainwater Br. 35, is therefore false. \nAlso false is Rainwater’s assertion that “no court has found that the HCDA affords a \nprivate cause of action.”  Rainwater Br. 37.  The Fifth Circuit has specifically held that the \nHCDA provides plaintiffs with a right of action to enforce anti-discrimination provisions of the \nstatute.19  Montgomery Improvement Ass’n v. HUD, 645 F.2d 291, 295 (5th Cir. 1981) (“[W]here \n                                                 \n19 But cf. Latinos Unidos De Chelsea En Accion (LUCHA) v. HUD, 799 F.2d 774, 795 (1st \nCir. 1986) (finding no private right of action to enforce certain provisions of the HCDA); Chan \nv. City of N.Y., 1 F.3d 96, 102 (2d Cir. 1993) (same); Freeman v. Fahey, 374 F.3d 663 (8th Cir. \n \n31\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 43 of 77\n \nCongress enacts legislation for a particular purpose and forbids the expenditure of federal funds \nin a manner that will discriminate against members of designated classes in the execution of that \npurpose . . . [m]embers of those groups . . . may bring an action in federal court to seek redress \nfor such discrimination.”).  The Fifth Circuit specifically concluded, as Plaintiffs contend here, \nthat Congress intended to create a private right of action to enforce the nondiscrimination \nprovisions of the HCDA.  See id. at 296-97 (“It is clear from the [HCDA] that Congress granted \n‘persons of low and moderate income’ certain rights and expressly forbad discrimination or \nexclusion from benefits based on race, color, national origin, or sex.  There is nothing in the Act \nto suggest any congressional purpose to deny a private cause of action.”).20 \nIn light of the clear legislative history, this Court’s analysis could end here.  Nat’l Postal \nProf’l Nurses, 461 F. Supp. 2d at 32 n.1.  However, Plaintiffs’ argument that the HCDA may be \nenforced through an implied right of action is further supported by examination of additional \nfactors.  Like the plaintiffs in Montgomery, Plaintiffs here—low- and moderate-income \nbeneficiaries of a federal housing program—are clearly part of the “class for whose especial \nbenefit the statute was enacted.”  Cort, 422 U.S. at 78.  Indeed, even in the principal case upon \nwhich Rainwater relies to support his argument that the HCDA does not provide plaintiffs with a \n                                                                                                                                                             \n2004) (same).  The D.C. Circuit has not yet addressed the issue of whether the HCDA provides \nan implied right of action. \n20 Rainwater relies on Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1 (1981), \nto claim that because the HCDA was enacted pursuant to Congress’s spending clause authority, \nthere is no private right of action.  See Rainwater Br. 37.  But in Pennhurst, the Court concluded \nthat the statute at issue did not create a private right of action because it was merely a funding \nstatute, and the language in “no way suggests that the grant of federal funds is ‘conditioned.’”  \n451 U.S. at 23.  By contrast, the grant of CDBG funds is specifically and unequivocally \nconditioned upon the grantee’s compliance with the statute’s mandates.  See 42 U.S.C. \n§ 5304(b)(2); see also Wilder v. Va. Hosp. Ass’n, 496 U.S. 498, 509 (1990) (concluding that a \nprovision of the Medicaid Act provided an enforceable private right and distinguishing \nPennhurst on the ground that “neither the statute nor the corresponding regulations made \ncompliance with the provision a condition of receipt of federal funding”). \n \n32\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 44 of 77\n \nprivate right of action, the court concluded that low- and moderate-income individuals, as the \n“intended occupants of the contemplated housing,” are “within the primary protection of the \n[HCDA].”  People’s Hous. Dev. Corp. v. City of Poughkeepsie, 425 F. Supp. 482, 491 (S.D.N.Y. \n1976).  Although the court ultimately concluded that the HCDA did not provide the plaintiff with \na private right of action, it did so primarily because the only plaintiff was an organization, which \ncould not “be characterized as ‘one of the class for whose especial benefit’ the [HCDA] was \nenacted.”  Id. (citing Cort, 422 U.S. at 78).  By contrast, Plaintiffs here include a class of low- \nand moderate-income individuals who are the “intended occupants of the contemplated \nhousing.”  Id.  \nGiven Congress’s clear intent to protect persons of low and moderate income, a private \nremedy is also consistent with the purposes of the HCDA.  Rainwater’s argument that the “sole \nremedies” for violations of the HCDA are contained in 42 U.S.C. § 5311 is without merit.  See \nRainwater Br. 34-35.  Although § 5311 does provide for certain enforcement measures to be \nundertaken by the Secretary of HUD or the Attorney General, these federal enforcement options \ncannot be read to preclude private enforcement in light of the clear congressional intent to the \ncontrary.  See People’s Hous. Dev. Corp., 425 F. Supp. at 491 (holding that the § 5311 \nenforcement measures “do not necessarily preclude private rights of action”); Wright v. City of \nRoanoke Redevelopment & Hous. Auth., 479 U.S. 418, 424 (1987) (rejecting argument that \nenforcement scheme in Housing Act of 1937 demonstrated Congress’s intent to foreclose a \nprivate action because the Act and its “legislative history [were] devoid of any express indication \nthat exclusive enforcement authority was vested in HUD”). \n \n33\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 45 of 77\n \nb.  Plaintiffs may enforce the HCDA against Rainwater under 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983. \n  Even if this Court concludes that Plaintiffs do not have an implied right of action under \nthe HCDA, Plaintiffs’ § 5304(b) claim is enforceable against Rainwater under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  \nSee Price v. City of Stockton, 390 F.3d 1105, 1114-15 (9th Cir. 2004) (holding that plaintiffs’ \nclaims under § 5304(d)(2)(A)(iii) and (iv) of the HCDA were enforceable under § 1983); Chan v. \nCity of N.Y., 1 F.3d 96, 106 (2d Cir. 1993) (holding that plaintiffs’ claims under § 5310 of the \nHCDA were enforceable under § 1983). \nThe central inquiry in determining whether a statutory provision is enforceable under \n§ 1983 is “whether or not Congress intended to confer individual rights upon a class of \nbeneficiaries.”  Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 285 (2002).  To determine whether, in \nenacting a particular statutory provision, Congress intended to create rights enforceable by \nprivate parties pursuant to § 1983, courts consider “(1) whether Congress intended the provision \nin question to benefit the plaintiff; (2) whether the plaintiff has demonstrated that the asserted \nright ‘is not so vague and amorphous that its enforcement would strain judicial competence’; and \n(3) whether the provision giving rise to the right is ‘couched in mandatory, rather than precatory, \nterms.’”  Price, 390 F.3d at 1109 (quoting Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329, 340-41 (1997)).  \nThe § 1983 inquiry “begins with a presumption in favor of the right to bring suit, for the ‘general \nrule’ is that § 1983 provides a remedy for violations of federal statutory rights unless ‘Congress \nhas affirmatively withdrawn the remedy.’”  Chan, 1 F.3d at 103 (quoting Wilder v. Virginia \nHosp. Ass’n, 496 U.S. 498, 509 n. 9 (1990)); see also Golden State Transit Corp. v. City of L.A., \n493 U.S. 103, 106 (1989) (“[T]he coverage of [§ 1983] must be broadly construed.”). \nAll elements of the congressional-intent inquiry are met here.  First, it is beyond question \nthat Congress intended the HCDA to benefit low- and moderate-income individuals, such as \n \n34\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 46 of 77\n \nPlaintiffs, who are beneficiaries of federal housing programs.  See 42 U.S.C. § 5301(c) (“The \nprimary objective of [the HCDA] is the development of viable urban communities, by providing \ndecent housing and a suitable living environment and expanding economic opportunities, \nprincipally for persons of low and moderate income.”); see also Chan, 1 F.3d at 104 (holding \nthat the plaintiffs were the intended beneficiaries of one provision of the HCDA).   \nSecond, it does not “strain judicial competence” for a court to determine whether a \ngrantee has administered federal funds in a discriminatory manner, or has failed to affirmatively \nfurther fair housing.  See, e.g., NAACP, 817 F.2d at 158-59 (holding that courts are capable of \ndetermining whether “HUD’s pattern of activity reveals a failure to live up to is obligation . . . to \naffirmatively further the policies of fair housing,” and noting that this determination is not “any \nmore difficult than other civil rights cases in which courts have judged the lawfulness of agency \nbehavior against roughly analogous standards”); Anderson v. Jackson, No. 06-3298, 2007 WL \n458232, at *3 (E.D. La. Feb. 6, 2007) (holding that the duty to affirmatively further fair housing \nis not “too vague and amorphous for the courts to enforce” (quoting Langlois, 234 F. Supp. 2d at \n72)); Wallace v. Chi. Hous. Auth., 298 F. Supp. 2d 710, 719 (N.D. Ill. 2003) (noting that the \n“parties [cannot] seriously contend” that a claim under § 3608(e)(5) “strains judicial \ncompetence”). \nThird, § 5304(b)(2) of the HCDA is “couched in mandatory, rather than precatory, \nterms.”  Blessing, 520 U.S. at 341.  The statute provides that “[a]ny grant . . . shall be made only \nif the grantee certifies” that the nondiscrimination and fair housing certification requirements will \nbe met.  42 U.S.C. § 5304(b)(2) (emphasis added).  This language unambiguously imposes a \nbinding obligation on grantees.  See Chan v. City of N.Y., 803 F. Supp. 710, 725 (S.D.N.Y. 1992) \n \n35\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 47 of 77\n \n(holding that the use of the term “shall” in § 5310 of the HCDA “indicates that Congress sought \nto create a binding obligation on the governmental unit”), aff’d, 1 F.3d at 104. \nAlthough, as noted above, the HCDA does provide for limited HUD enforcement, see 42 \nU.S.C. § 5311, these enforcement provisions are not sufficiently comprehensive to indicate that \nCongress intended for HUD enforcement to be the exclusive remedy.  See Wright, 479 U.S. at \n428 (“HUD’s authority to audit, enforce annual contributions contracts, and cut off federal funds \n. . . are generalized powers [that] are insufficient to indicate a congressional intent to foreclose \n§ 1983 remedies.”); Johnson v. Hous. Auth. of Jefferson Parish, 442 F.3d 356, 366 (5th Cir. \n2006) (noting that “[b]oth methods of enforcement, i.e., HUD oversight and private actions \nunder § 1983, may coexist if Congress so intends”); Price, 390 F.3d at 1114 (“The [HCDA] does \nnot expressly preclude suits under Section 1983, nor does it provide a comprehensive remedial \nscheme incompatible with private enforcement.”); Chan, 803 F. Supp. at 728.  \nBecause Plaintiffs are among the intended beneficiaries of the § 5304(b)(2) requirement \nthat Disaster Recovery Grant funds be administered to affirmatively further fair housing, the \nstatute may be enforced under § 1983. \nB.  The Administrative Procedure Act does not preclude Plaintiffs’ claims \nagainst HUD. \nHUD argues that §§ 704 and 706 of the APA bar Plaintiffs’ claims because (1) Plaintiffs \nhave an adequate remedy in court against HUD’s co-defendant Rainwater, see HUD Br. 32-35; \n(2) Plaintiffs have failed to allege a final agency action, see id. at 39; and (3) HUD’s statutory \nobligation to affirmatively further fair housing does not entail any discrete agency action that \nHUD is required to undertake, see id. at 36-40. \nAs an initial matter, HUD’s arguments erroneously assume that Plaintiffs’ claims must be \nassessed under the APA.  But the express waiver of sovereign immunity in 5 U.S.C. § 702 \n \n36\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 48 of 77\n \napplies to all actions brought against federal agencies for relief other than money damages, and \ndoes not constrain Plaintiffs to proceed under the APA.  Schnapper v. Foley, 667 F.2d 102, 107 \n(D.C. Cir. 1981) (citing the legislative history of § 702); see also Fallon, Meltzer, & Shapiro, \nHart & Wechsler’s The Federal Courts & The Federal System 968-69 (5th ed. 2003) (“Though \ncodified in the APA, the [§ 702] waiver applies to any suit, whether under the APA, § 1331, . . . \nor any other statute.”).  Thus, because both Title VIII and the HCDA provide Plaintiffs with a \ndirect right of action to challenge HUD’s discriminatory conduct, Plaintiffs need not proceed \nunder the APA at all, and HUD’s motion to dismiss based on various APA requirements should \nbe denied.   \nEven if Plaintiffs’ claims for relief may only be brought under the APA, the motion to \ndismiss should be denied because Plaintiffs’ claims against Rainwater are not an adequate \nalternative to a remedy for HUD’s distinct discriminatory conduct, and because the “discrete \nagency action” requirement does not preclude review of HUD’s actions in this case. \n1.  Title VIII and the HCDA directly confer a right of action to challenge \nHUD’s discriminatory conduct. \nAs noted, Plaintiffs allege that HUD violated the anti-discrimination provisions of Title \nVIII, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3604(a) and 3605(a), and that HUD has failed to fulfill its affirmative \nobligations under § 3608(e)(5) of Title VIII and § 5304(b)(2) of the HCDA.  Compl. ¶¶ 74-77. \nPlaintiffs’ claims under 42 U.S.C. §§ 3604(a) and 3605(a) are directly enforceable \nagainst HUD by the express terms of Title VIII.  Section 3613 of Title VIII provides a right of \naction in federal court to redress “an alleged discriminatory housing practice.”  42 U.S.C. \n§ 3613(a)(1)(A).  The statute further defines discriminatory housing practice to include “an act \nthat is unlawful under section 3604 [or] 3605 . . . of this title.”  42 U.S.C. § 3602(f).  Because \n \n37\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 49 of 77\n \nPlaintiffs specifically allege that HUD engaged in discriminatory activity in violation of §§ 3604 \nand 3605, they may raise such claims under the express grant of jurisdiction pursuant to § 3613. \nPlaintiffs’ claims under § 3608(e)(5) are also directly enforceable against HUD under \n§ 3613.  See Young v. Pierce, 544 F. Supp. 1010, 1017-18 (E.D. Tex. 1982).  In Young, the \ndistrict court held that § 3608(e)(5) was directly enforceable against HUD because the nature of \nthe § 3608(e)(5) obligation made HUD’s failure to meet that obligation a “discriminatory \nhousing practice” enforceable under § 3613: \n[I]t seems axiomatic that violations of [§ 3608(e)(5)] through \ninaction or indolence must be actionable.  Failure of HUD \n“affirmatively to further the policies of [Title VIII]” is illegal in a \nfundamental sense. . . .  Viewed another way, the failure of HUD \nto perform its legal duties mandated by [§ 3608(e)(5)] constitutes a \ndiscriminatory housing practice, in itself. \n \nId. at 1018.21  In reaching this conclusion, the court noted the scope and breadth of HUD’s \nobligations under Title VIII, and reasoned that the statute’s enforcement provisions must also be \nconstrued expansively.  Id. at 1017 (“The scope of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 is majestic, and \nits enforcement provisions are commensurately broad.”).  A broad reading of Title VIII’s \nenforcement provisions is consistent with the “familiar canon of statutory construction that \nremedial legislation should be construed broadly to effectuate its purposes.”  Tcherepnin v. \nKnight, 389 U.S. 332, 336 (1967); see also Hous. Opportunities Made Equal, Inc. v. Cincinnati \nEnquirer, Inc., 943 F.2d 644, 646 (6th Cir. 1991) (“Courts have given a broad reading to the \n                                                 \n21 Plaintiffs recognize that a different judge of this Court has held that § 3608(e)(5) may only \nbe enforced through the APA and cannot be enforced through § 3613.  See Jones v. Office of the \nComptroller of the Currency, 983 F. Supp. 197, 202-03 & n.8 (D.D.C. 1997) (Friedman, J.).  \nJones was affirmed after a pro se appeal to the D.C. Circuit in an unpublished, per curiam order \n“substantially for the reasons stated by the district court.”  Jones v. Office of the Comptroller of \nthe Currency, No. 97-5341, 1998 WL 315581, at *1 (D.C. Cir. May 12, 1998).  Under the rules \nof the D.C. Circuit, the unpublished affirmance of Jones does not have precedential effect on this \nor any Court, see Circuit Rule 32.1(b)(1)(A), and Plaintiffs respectfully submit that the better \nreading of Title VIII is that applied by the Eastern District of Texas in Young. \n \n38\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 50 of 77\n \n[Fair Housing Act] in order to fulfill its remedial purpose.”); cf. City of Edmonds v. Oxford \nHouse, Inc., 514 U.S. 725, 731 (1995) (“We also note precedent recognizing the [Fair Housing \nAct’s] ‘broad and inclusive’ compass, and therefore according a ‘generous construction’ to the \nAct’s complaint-filing provision.” (quoting Trafficante v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 409 U.S. 205, \n209, 212 (1972))). \nIn addition, as demonstrated supra Part II.A.2.a, Plaintiffs can enforce 42 U.S.C. \n§ 5304(b)(2) directly against HUD through an implied right of action.  See Montgomery, 645 \nF.2d at 293-97. \n2.  Plaintiffs’ claims against HUD are reviewable under 5 U.S.C. § 704. \nIf Plaintiffs’ § 3608(e)(5) and § 5304(b)(2) claims may only be reviewed under the APA, \n5 U.S.C. § 704 permits those claims to proceed against HUD because Plaintiffs have no other \nadequate remedy in a court.  Section 704 provides, in pertinent part, that “final agency action for \nwhich there is no other adequate remedy in a court [is] subject to judicial review.”  5 U.S.C. \n§ 704.  HUD contends that Plaintiffs’ § 3608(e)(5) and § 5304(b)(2) claims are not reviewable, \nboth because Plaintiffs could have an adequate alternative remedy by asserting discrimination \nclaims against the responsible Louisiana state officials and because Plaintiffs do not challenge a \nfinal agency action.  HUD Br. 32-35.  Both arguments are incorrect.   \na.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy for HUD’s discriminatory \nconduct other than a remedy from HUD. \nHUD first argues that its conduct is unreviewable under § 704 because Plaintiffs have an \nadequate remedy against Louisiana state officials.  HUD Br. 32-35.  But even if Plaintiffs prevail \non their discrimination claims against Rainwater, any remedy fashioned against Rainwater alone \nwould be ineffective without a judgment against HUD.  Put simply, because HUD and the state \n \n39\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 51 of 77\n \nof Louisiana are jointly responsible for the program’s implementation, proper remedial action \nmay be ensured only by a court order applicable to both entities. \nCongress’s purposes in enacting § 704 were (1) to codify the “proposition that ‘[o]ne \nneed not exhaust administrative remedies that are inadequate,’” and (2) to make clear that \n“Congress did not intend the general grant of review in the APA to duplicate existing procedures \nfor review of agency action.”  Bowen, 487 U.S. at 902-03 (quoting Davis, Administrative Law \n§ 26:11, at 464 (2d ed. 1983)).  Plaintiffs’ remedies against Rainwater are not an adequate \nsubstitute for redress from HUD’s violation of the unique obligation that it is required to fulfill \nunder federal fair housing law, and this Court’s review of HUD’s compliance with its fair \nhousing obligations will not “duplicate existing procedures” for review of agency action.  Id. \nSection 3608(e)(5) of the Fair Housing Act requires the Secretary of HUD to \naffirmatively further fair housing.  42 U.S.C. § 3608(e)(5).  It is well-established that this \nstatutory mandate requires HUD to take active, affirmative steps—steps beyond its obligation to \navoid discrimination—to promote fair housing and desegregation in its programs and activities.  \nSee NAACP, 817 F.2d at 155; Lee v. Pierce, 698 F. Supp. 332, 342 (D.D.C. 1988) (noting that \nunder § 3608(e)(5), “HUD is obliged to do more than simply refrain from discriminating”).  \nSimilarly, the HCDA imposes an affirmative duty on HUD that is distinct from the obligations of \nHUD’s grantees.  Under § 5304(b)(2), HUD must ensure that block grants distributed under the \nHCDA “will be conducted and administered in conformity” with Title VI and Title VIII, and that \n“the grantee will affirmatively further fair housing.”  42 U.S.C. § 5304(b)(2). \nIn accordance with these requirements, HUD has promulgated a detailed regulatory \nframework to oversee the administration of regular CDBG and Disaster Recovery Grant funds.  \nSee 24 C.F.R. Parts 91 and 570; 71 Fed. Reg. at 7666-72; 71 Fed. Reg. at 63,337-40; 72 Fed. \n \n40\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 52 of 77\n \nReg. at 70,472-74; 73 Fed. Reg. at 46,312-22.  The regulatory scheme recognizes HUD’s \nexpertise and obligation to monitor grant recipients for compliance with civil rights and other \nprogram requirements, as the Kome Declaration submitted with HUD’s motion to dismiss \nacknowledges.  See, e.g., 71 Fed. Reg. at 7668, 7670 (describing HUD’s oversight process and \nrole in providing “technical assistance” to grantees); Kome Decl. ¶¶ 16-17, 19, 22 (describing \nLouisiana’s reliance on technical assistance from HUD, based on HUD’s expertise in monitoring \nthe administration of CDBG funds in other jurisdictions).  HUD’s supervisory role thus is not \nonly essential but required to ensure that grantees such as Rainwater comply with their \naffirmative anti-discrimination obligations. \nIn light of HUD’s role in ensuring that Rainwater’s use of Disaster Recovery Grant funds \ncomplies with fair housing law, Plaintiffs’ claims against Rainwater alone cannot provide an \nadequate remedy to redress the harm caused by HUD’s failure to comply with its own \nobligations to further fair housing.  A complete remedy would require both that Rainwater \ndevelop a nondiscriminatory formula, and that HUD approve and oversee the administration of \nthat formula.  See 2005 Act, 119 Stat. at 2780 (requiring grantees to submit and HUD to approve \na plan detailing the proposed use and criteria for eligibility of all Disaster Recovery Grant \nfunds); 2006 Act, 120 Stat. at 473 (same); see also 42 U.S.C. § 5304(a)(1); 71 Fed. Reg. at 7669, \n7671; 71 Fed. Reg. at 63,339; 72 Fed. Reg. at 70,472.  \nFor this reason, several courts applying § 3608(e)(5) have expressly rejected HUD’s \nargument that relief from a HUD grantee is an adequate substitute for relief against HUD.  \nThompson v. HUD, 348 F. Supp. 2d 398, 422 (D. Md. 2005) (“[T]he Court does not construe \n§ 704 to foreclose Plaintiffs’ access to the APA with respect to HUD’s alleged Title VIII \nviolations.”); Dean v. Martinez, 336 F. Supp. 2d 477, 487 (D. Md. 2004) (“Because APA review \n \n41\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 53 of 77\n \nof HUD’s [Fair Housing Act] compliance . . . addresses a different harm from the plaintiffs’ \nclaims against the City . . . such claims are within the court’s jurisdiction.”); cf. Henry Horner \nMothers Guild v. Chi. Hous. Auth., 824 F. Supp. 808, 819-20 (N.D. Ill. 1993); Tinsley v. Kemp, \n750 F. Supp. 1001, 1009 (W.D. Mo. 1990).22  The district court’s analysis in Tinsley is \nparticularly instructive.  In that case, public housing residents sued both HUD and their local \npublic housing authority (the Housing Authority of Kansas City, or HAKC) under the Housing \nAct, claiming that the defendants were permitting deterioration of residential units amounting to \nillegal demolition.  Tinsley, 750 F. Supp. at 1003.  HUD argued in Tinsley, as here, that § 704 \nbarred review of HUD’s actions because an adequate remedy was available by proceeding \nagainst the housing authority alone.  Id. at 1009.  The court flatly rejected this argument, holding: \nThe pervasive regulation, the frequent and close oversight, and the \nfunding provided by HUD to HAKC illustrates that HAKC could \nnot correct alleged problems to any significant degree without \nHUD cooperation, supervision, approval and funding. A remedy \ndirected only at HAKC could be nearly worthless in these \ncircumstances. Any meaningful remedy could be achieved only \nwith HUD’s involvement, so Section 704 does not preclude \njudicial review here. \n \nTinsley, 750 F. Supp. at 1009; see also Henry Horner Mothers Guild, 824 F. Supp. at 819-20.  \nThe approach of these courts is consistent with the Supreme Court’s direction that § 704 “should \nnot be construed to defeat the central purpose of providing a broad spectrum of judicial review of \nagency action.”  Bowen, 487 U.S. at 903-04 (noting that the APA’s “‘generous review \nprovisions’ must be given a ‘hospitable’ interpretation” (quoting Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 \nU.S. 136, 140-41 (1967))). \n                                                 \n22 Numerous other courts have implicitly rejected HUD’s § 704 argument by adjudicating \nclaims against HUD for § 3608(e)(5) and § 5304(b) violations even though the plaintiffs in those \ncases also sued HUD grantees.  See, e.g., Davis v. HUD, 627 F.2d 942, 945 (9th Cir. 1980); \nMejia v. HUD, 518 F. Supp. 935, 937 (N.D. Ill. 1981); Colony Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass’n v. Harris, \n482 F. Supp. 296, 304 (W.D. Pa. 1980). \n \n42\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 54 of 77\n \nHUD cites the following cases as being to the contrary: American Disabled for Attendant \nPrograms Today (ADAPT) v. HUD, 170 F.3d 381 (3d Cir. 1999), Washington Legal Foundation \nv. Alexander, 984 F.2d 483 (D.C. Cir. 1993), and Women’s Equity Action League v. Cavazos, \n906 F.2d 742 (D.C. Cir. 1990).  See HUD Br. 33-34.  Each of the cited cases involved a \nplaintiff’s allegation that HUD violated the law by failing to enforce compliance by federal-\nfunding recipients with nondiscrimination requirements.  See ADAPT, 170 F.3d at 384-85; \nWashington Legal, 984 F.2d at 484; Women’s Equity, 906 F.2d at 748.  The court in each case \nheld that because the plaintiffs had a right of action against the third parties to redress the claims \nof discrimination, there was a judicial alternative to a suit against HUD and review was therefore \nbarred by § 704.  See ADAPT, 170 F.3d at 390; Washington Legal, 984 F.2d at 487-88; Women’s \nEquity, 906 F.2d at 750.  But the instant case does not seek to compel HUD to investigate \nanother party’s fair housing violations.  Rather, Plaintiffs seek declaratory and mandatory \ninjunctive relief to redress HUD’s own conduct in which it failed to perform its affirmative \nobligations under fair housing law.  See, e.g., Vaughn v. Consumer Home Mortgage, Inc., 293 F. \nSupp. 2d 206, 213 (E.D.N.Y. 2003) (distinguishing ADAPT and Washington Legal, and holding \nthat relief against federal-funding recipients is not an adequate alternative under § 704 to review \nof HUD’s compliance with its own obligations); Lattimore v. Nw. Coop. Homes Ass’n, No. 90-\n0049, 1992 WL 118383, at *7 (D.D.C. May 19, 1992) (concluding that the plaintiff’s claims \nagainst private defendants did not provide her with an “adequate remedy” where “Defendant \nHUD has not identified any other mechanism that would insure that plaintiff could obtain \nappropriate relief against the government”). \nPlaintiffs’ claims against Rainwater are distinct from the claims against HUD, and relief \nagainst Rainwater would not redress the specific harm that the Plaintiffs have incurred because \n \n43\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 55 of 77\n \nof HUD’s own conduct.  HUD’s participation is necessary to remedy the unlawful conduct at \nissue in this case.  Plaintiffs’ claims against HUD for violations of § 3608(e)(5) and § 5304(b) \nare therefore reviewable under the APA, because “there is no other adequate remedy in a court.”  \n5 U.S.C. § 704. \nb.  Plaintiffs challenge final agency action. \nHUD argues in a single paragraph that review is barred by § 704 because Plaintiffs have \nnot alleged any final agency action.  HUD Br. 39.  This argument is also incorrect. \nThe final agency action limitation is intended to ensure that courts are not asked to \nsupervise an agency’s “continuing (and thus constantly changing) operations,” but instead to \nintervene only to correct agency actions or inactions that have “an actual or immediately \nthreatened effect.”  Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, 497 U.S. at 890, 894.  Plaintiffs’ Complaint alleges that \nHUD assisted in developing, and then approved, the racially discriminatory Road Home grant \nformula.  Compl. ¶ 50.  Plaintiffs also allege actual effects from these final actions, including that \nAfrican American homeowners in New Orleans are burdened by a discriminatory disparity in \naccess to rebuilding resources compared to white homeowners.  Id. ¶¶ 52-60.  HUD does not \nsuggest that its approval of the discriminatory Road Home grant formula is likely to change, and \nPlaintiffs have therefore stated a challenge to a final agency action.  See Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, \n497 U.S. at 890, 894; Thompson v. HUD, No. 95-309, 2006 WL 581260, at *5-6 (D. Md. Jan. 10, \n2006). \n3.  The “discrete agency action” requirement does not preclude review of \nHUD’s actions in this case. \nHUD argues that its compliance with § 3608(e)(5) and § 5304(b)(2) may not be reviewed \nunder the APA, because there is no discrete agency action that HUD was required to take.  HUD \ncites Norton v. Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, 542 U.S. 55 (2004) (“SUWA”), for the \n \n44\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 56 of 77\n \nproposition that § 706(1) of the APA precludes review of HUD’s actions in this case.  See HUD \nBr. 36.  This argument should be rejected because HUD’s conduct is properly reviewed under \n§ 706(2), not § 706(1), and SUWA therefore does not apply.  Moreover, even if this Court were \nto evaluate HUD’s actions under the § 706(1) scope of review framework, the SUWA standard is \nmet here. \na.  HUD’s conduct is properly reviewed pursuant to § 706(2). \nThe APA provides that federal courts may review agency action pursuant to two distinct \nscope of review provisions.  Where agency action is otherwise reviewable:  \nThe reviewing court shall— \n(1) compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably \ndelayed; and \n(2) hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and \nconclusions found to be— \n(A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise \nnot in accordance with law; [or] \n. . .  \n(C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, \nor short of statutory right . . . . \n \n5 U.S.C. § 706.  HUD assumes without discussion that Plaintiffs’ claims should be reviewed \nunder § 706(1).  Plaintiffs’ claims are properly reviewed under § 706(2), not § 706(1), because \nPlaintiffs ask the Court to set aside agency action that is arbitrary and capricious or that is in \nexcess of HUD’s statutory authority. \nPlaintiffs specifically allege that certain HUD actions have violated § 3608(e)(5) and \n§ 5304(b)(2).  Compl. ¶¶ 74-77.  Plaintiffs allege that HUD is responsible for the administration, \nfunding, and supervision of federal low-income housing programs, including the CDBG Disaster \nRecovery Grant program, and that HUD may not waive fair housing or nondiscrimination \nrequirements in its administration of the Disaster Recovery Grant program.  Id. ¶¶ 6, 18, 37.  \nPlaintiffs allege that HUD consulted with the LRA on the design and development of the Road \n \n45\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 57 of 77\n \nHome grant formula; that HUD approved the grant formula and other Road Home program \ndetails; and that HUD is engaged in continuing oversight and approval of the Road Home \nprogram.  Id. ¶¶ 49-51.  Plaintiffs further allege that because of these actions by HUD, the \nindividual and organizational plaintiffs have suffered illegal racial discrimination in violation of \nTitle VIII and the HCDA.  Id. ¶¶ 52-73. \nProperly considered, then, Plaintiffs’ claims are based on affirmative decisions and \nactions undertaken by HUD that have violated § 3608(e)(5) and § 5304(b), and are therefore \nreviewable under § 706(2).  See, e.g., NAACP, 817 F.2d at 160-61; Thompson, 2006 WL 581260, \nat *3-4; M&T Mortgage Corp. v. White, No. 04-cv-4775, 2006 WL 47467, at *11-14 (E.D.N.Y. \nJan. 9, 2006). \nHUD repeatedly suggests that Plaintiffs have only alleged agency inaction.  See HUD Br. \n37-38.  As noted, the Complaint clearly alleges unlawful action and decisions by HUD.  Compl. \n¶¶ 6, 18, 37, 49-73.  And in any event, agency inaction is reviewable under § 706(2) as well \nwhen, as here, Congress has imposed affirmative statutory obligations.  See, e.g., NAACP, 817 \nF.2d at 160 (explaining that “[t]he purpose of § 706(2)(A) is to provide for judicial review of \nagency action and inaction that falls outside its statutory powers” (emphasis added)); Am. Horse \nProt. Ass’n v. Lyng, 812 F.2d 1, 4 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (“[T]his case requires a determination of \nwhether the Secretary’s failure to act was ‘arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \notherwise not in accordance with law’ under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).” (emphasis added)); see also \n5 U.S.C. § 551(13) (“For the purpose of this subchapter . . . ‘agency action’ includes . . . failure \nto act.”). \nBecause Plaintiffs’ claims are reviewable under § 706(2), HUD’s discussion of SUWA \nshould be disregarded.

U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 515 F. \n \n46\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 58 of 77\n \nSupp. 2d 1, 9-10 (D.D.C. 2007) (Kennedy, J.) (“SUWA addresses only attempts to ‘compel \nagency action’ pursuant to § 706(1) and does not reach claims encompassed within § 706(2), \nwhich merely seek to ‘hold unlawful and set aside’ arbitrary or capricious ‘agency action[s].’”).23  \nIndeed, SUWA could not reach claims brought under the § 706(2) scope of review provision, \nbecause the plaintiffs in SUWA only sought § 706(1) review.  See S. Utah Wilderness Alliance v. \nBabbitt, No. 99-852, 2000 WL 33347722, at *2 (D. Utah Dec. 22, 2000) (“Plaintiffs’ claims are \nall brought under section 706(1) of the Administrative Procedure Act . . . .”).  HUD’s effort to \nextend the SUWA analysis to this case should therefore be rejected.24 \nb.  Even if HUD’s actions can only be reviewed pursuant to \n§ 706(1), the “discrete agency action” requirement is met here. \nEven if HUD is correct that § 706(1) provides the proper scope of review of HUD’s \nconduct in this case, Plaintiffs meet the standard established in SUWA. \nIn SUWA, the plaintiffs alleged that the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) violated a \nstatute requiring that certain wilderness study areas be managed “so as not to impair their \nsuitability for preservation as wilderness,” by failing to act to protect public lands in Utah from \nenvironmental damage caused by off-road vehicles.  SUWA, 542 U.S. at 58-59 (quoting 43 \nU.S.C. § 1782(c)).  The Supreme Court held that “a claim under § 706(1) can proceed only \nwhere a plaintiff asserts that an agency failed to take a discrete agency action that it is required \nto take.”  Id. at 64.  Because banning off-road vehicles from wilderness study areas was not an \n                                                 \n23 For the same reason, HUD’s argument that the First Circuit’s NAACP decision was \nimplicitly overruled by SUWA, see HUD Br. 38, should be rejected.  The First Circuit held in \nNAACP that review of HUD’s compliance with its § 3608(e)(5) obligations was proper under \nboth § 706(1) and § 706(2).  NAACP, 817 F.2d at 160-61.  Because SUWA only addressed the \n§ 706(1) scope of review provision, NAACP is still good law. \n24 Despite HUD’s suggestion to the contrary, Plaintiffs are not seeking a court order telling \nHUD how to exercise its discretion in awarding unobligated funds.  See HUD Br. 39.  Instead, \nPlaintiffs seek an injunction providing, inter alia, that HUD must exercise its mandatory fair \nhousing obligation with respect to funds that it obligates—or has already obligated—to LRA. \n \n47\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 59 of 77\n \naction that BLM was specifically required to take in order to meet its statutory obligation, the \nSupreme Court rejected the plaintiffs’ claim.  Id. at 65-67.  SUWA thus limits justiciable \nchallenges under § 706(1) to those in which an agency is under a non-general legal duty to act. \nThe purpose of the discrete-agency-action limitation is to “protect agencies from undue \njudicial interference with their lawful discretion, and to avoid judicial entanglement in abstract \npolicy disagreements which courts lack both expertise and information to resolve.”  Id. at 66.  \nThe limitation thus precludes “the kind of broad programmatic attack we rejected in Lujan v. \nNational Wildlife Federation.”  Id. at 64 (internal citation omitted). \nHUD argues that its obligations under § 3608(e)(5) and § 5304(b) are too general to be \nenforced under the APA.  However, in light of the purposes of the discrete-agency-action \nlimitation, Plaintiffs have properly alleged that HUD failed to take discrete actions it is required \nto take, and are not seeking to bring an impermissibly broad programmatic attack. \nFirst, the Fair Housing Act establishes a specific legal duty on HUD to act affirmatively \nto promote fair housing.  As noted, § 3608(e)(5) provides that “[t]he Secretary of Housing and \nUrban Development shall . . . administer the programs and activities relating to housing and \nurban development in a manner affirmatively to further the policies of this subchapter.”  42 \nU.S.C. § 3608(e)(5).  The policies of the Fair Housing Act are not abstract or imprecise, but \nrather are specific and categorical.  They include “to provide . . . for fair housing throughout the \nUnited States,” 42 U.S.C. § 3601; to replace concentrated African American ghettos with “truly \nintegrated and balanced living patterns,” 114 Cong. Rec. 3422 (statement of Sen. Mondale); and \nto “remove the walls of discrimination which enclose minority groups,” 114 Cong. Rec. 9563 \n(statement of Rep. Celler).  Thus, HUD has, “at a minimum, an obligation to assess negatively \nthose aspects of a proposed course of action that would further limit the supply of genuinely \n \n48\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 60 of 77\n \nopen housing.”  NAACP, 817 F.2d at 156.  Put simply, “the Act’s fair housing policy requires \nsomething more of HUD than simply to refrain from discriminating itself or purposely aiding the \ndiscrimination of others.”  Id. at 154. \nHUD’s obligations pursuant to § 3608(e)(5) are therefore simply not comparable to the \nstatute at issue in SUWA.  Unlike the challenge in SUWA, where the Supreme Court held that \nimposing on BLM an obligation to ban off-road vehicles would interfere with its discretion in \nmeeting its wilderness-preservation mandate, Plaintiffs’ effort to require HUD to promote fair \nhousing as required by § 3608(e)(5) does not require undue judicial interference with HUD’s \nlawful discretion.  Rather, remedies may be devised that take account of the nature of HUD’s \nstatutory violations while acknowledging agency discretion in day-to-day management.  \nAlthough HUD has discretion to determine precisely how it will meet its fair housing and \nnondiscrimination mandate, it does not have discretion, as HUD seems to assert, to decide not to \nmeet that mandate by allowing federal funds to be used in a way that works against fair housing \ngoals.  Plaintiffs have thus properly alleged that (in addition to the improper actions described \nabove) HUD failed to take acts that it was specifically required to take.  Cf. Natural Res. Def. \nCouncil v. Patterson, 333 F. Supp. 2d 906, 916 (E.D. Cal. 2004) (distinguishing SUWA and \nholding that an agency’s statutory obligation to “reestablish and maintain” the historic fisheries \nin certain California waterways was a “specific legal duty [that was] a far cry from the general \nstatutory directive that the government endeavor to manage certain of its lands ‘so as not to \nimpair their suitability for preservation as wilderness.’” (quoting 43 U.S.C. § 1782(c))). \nSecond, Plaintiffs have not raised an impermissibly broad programmatic attack that \nwould entangle this Court in abstract policy disagreements.  See SUWA, 542 U.S. at 64; Lujan v. \nNat’l Wildlife Fed’n, 497 U.S. 871, 890-94 (1990).  Courts have read National Wildlife \n \n49\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 61 of 77\n \nFederation to foreclose challenges to “broad ill-defined programs that do not cause concrete \neffects.”  Northcoast Envtl. Ctr. v. Glickman, 136 F.3d 660, 669 (9th Cir. 1998).  Plaintiffs here \nhave not challenged an ill-defined program without concrete effects, but rather have challenged a \nspecific set of HUD decisions with regard to the Road Home program that has resulted in the \nconcrete effect of disproportionately burdening African American families in their efforts to \nrepair and return to their homes.  See Compl. ¶¶ 52-60. \nSeveral courts have held, subsequent to the Supreme Court’s decision in SUWA, that \n§ 3608(e)(5) imposes enforceable obligations on HUD that may be reviewed under the APA.  In \nDarst-Webbe Tenant Association Board v. St. Louis Housing Authority, 417 F.3d 898, 907 (8th \nCir. 2005), for example, the Eighth Circuit held that SUWA permits review of whether “HUD \nexercised its broad authority in a manner that demonstrates consideration of, and an effort to \nachieve, . . . results” by furthering opportunities for fair housing.25  See also Thompson, 2006 \nWL 581260, at *4-5 (“As held in Darst-Webbe, SUWA does not prevent the Court from \nreviewing whether HUD has met its statutory duty to affirmatively further fair housing.”). \nThis Court should accordingly hold that review of HUD’s compliance with its obligation \nto affirmatively further fair housing is proper under the APA. \nC.  Plaintiffs’ Complaint alleges sufficient facts to state a claim against both \nHUD and Rainwater for violations of Title VIII and the HCDA. \nHUD and Rainwater raise various arguments regarding the sufficiency of the facts \nalleged in Plaintiffs’ Complaint.  See HUD Br. 40-45; Rainwater Br. 18-33.  In considering the \nsufficiency of a plaintiff’s factual allegations, this Court accepts a plaintiff’s allegations as true \n                                                 \n25 While the Eighth Circuit without analysis equated § 3608(e)(5) with the general land-\nmanagement statute at issue in SUWA, a comparison with which Plaintiffs disagree, the court \nnonetheless went on to identify a specific legal obligation that is enforceable against HUD—\nnamely, the obligation to “demonstrate[] consideration of, and an effort to achieve, . . . results” in \nthe form of furthering fair housing opportunities.  Darst-Webbe, 417 F.3d at 907. \n \n50\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 62 of 77\n \nand draws all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor.  Aktieselskabet AF 21 Nov. 2001 v. \nFame Jeans Inc., 525 F.3d 8, 15 (D.C. Cir. 2008).  The plaintiff’s allegations must “raise a right \nto relief above the speculative level.”  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. \n1.  HUD’s motion to dismiss must be denied because Plaintiffs allege \nsufficient facts to establish violations of Title VIII and the HCDA. \nHUD asserts that Plaintiffs’ Complaint fails to satisfy the pleading standard in Rule 8(a) \nfor its causes of action against HUD under Title VIII and the HCDA.  HUD Br. 40-45.  But \nPlaintiffs’ Complaint clearly satisfies Rule 8(a) by providing ample notice to HUD of the factual \nbasis for the claims of disparate impact discrimination under § 3604(a) and § 3605, and for the \nclaims that HUD failed to affirmatively further fair housing under § 3608(e)(5) and § 5304(b)(2). \nHUD first argues that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for disparate impact \ndiscrimination under § 3604(a) and § 3605(a).  HUD rests this argument on the uniformly \nrejected theory that Plaintiffs must plead a prima facie case in their Complaint and, consequently, \nthat Plaintiffs must allege statistically significant statistics about racial disparities caused by \nHUD’s policies.  See HUD Br. 41-43.  It is well-accepted that statistics showing a policy had a \ndisparate impact on a protected class satisfy a plaintiff’s prima facie case in a Title VIII disparate \nimpact action.  See 2922 Sherman Ave. Tenants’ Ass’n v. Dist. of Columbia, 444 F.3d 673, 679-\n81 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  But uniform authority makes it clear that plaintiffs need not establish a \nprima facie case at the pleading stage, because “[t]he prima facie case . . . is an evidentiary \nstandard, not a pleading requirement.”  Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 510, 515 \n(2002); see also Twombly, 550 U.S. at 569-70 (reaffirming Swierkiewicz and reiterating that a \nheightened pleading requirement does not apply to discrimination claims).  Thus, while Plaintiffs \nmay need to produce statistics on racial disparities to prove their case at trial, or to defeat a \n \n51\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 63 of 77\n \nsummary judgment motion by HUD, they cannot be required to plead such statistics to survive a \nmotion to dismiss.  See, e.g., NCRC, 573 F. Supp. 2d at 79.   \nIn NCRC, this Court rejected a defendant’s identical argument that to survive a motion to \ndismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), plaintiffs in a Title VIII disparate impact action were required to \nplead facts showing that the defendant’s mortgage underwriting policies caused a \ndisproportionate impact on African American homeowners, including statistics comparing how \nAfrican American and white homeowners fared when the policy was applied to them.  Id. \n(following Swierkiewicz and reiterating that “‘the requirements for establishing a prima facie \ncase’” do not “‘apply to the pleading standard that plaintiffs must satisfy in order to survive a \nmotion to dismiss.’”) (quoting Swierkiewicz, 534 U.S. at 511); NCRC Dkt., No. 07-1357. \nTellingly, HUD relies exclusively and inappropriately on cases involving summary \njudgment motions or trials (where showing the prima facie case is necessary), and cites not a \nsingle case involving a Rule 12(b)(6) motion (where showing the prima facie case is \nunnecessary).26   This Court should disregard these wholly inapposite cases and, as in NCRC, \nreaffirm that at this stage “the ordinary rules for assessing the sufficiency of a complaint apply,” \nand not a heightened pleading standard.  Id. (quoting Swierkiewicz, 534 U.S. at 511).   \n  Plaintiffs’ Complaint easily satisfies the proper pleading standard.  “Rule 8 requires not a \nspecific quantity of facts, but simply ‘a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the \n                                                 \n26 See HUD Br. 41 (citing Graoch Assocs. v. Louisville/Jefferson County Metro Human \nRelations Comm’n, 508 F.3d 366, 369 (6th Cir. 2007) (affirming an appeal from the grant of \nsummary judgment in favor of an apartment owner); 2922 Sherman Ave., 444 F.3d at 676 \n(reversing a judgment after a jury trial on a disparate impact claim and ordering a new trial on \nplaintiffs intentional discrimination claim); Huntington Branch, NAACP v. Town of Huntington, \n844 F.2d 926, 928 (2d Cir. 1988) (reversing an appeal from a judgment following a bench trial); \nUnited States v. City of Black Jack, 508 F.2d 1179, 1187-88 (8th Cir. 1974) (reversing a district \ncourt’s refusal to grant a permanent injunction and remanding for the district court to enter an \norder enjoining the enforcement of a discriminatory ordinance)).     \n \n52\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 64 of 77\n \npleader is entitled to relief.’”  Aktieselskabet, 525 F.3d at 16 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).  \nAs the Supreme Court recently explained, “[t]o survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must \ncontain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its \nface.’”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570).  \nThis “plausibility” standard is not a “probability requirement,” and instead merely requires a \nplaintiff to allege facts that allow the court to “draw the reasonable inference that the defendant \nis liable for the misconduct alleged” or, in other words, that there is “more than a sheer \npossibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.”  Id. (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556-57). \nPlaintiffs’ Complaint alleges more than enough facts to create a reasonable inference that \nHUD’s approval of the Road Home grant formula (and other actions) have caused a disparate \nimpact on African American homeowners in New Orleans in violation of §§ 3604(a) and \n3605(a).  The Complaint offers an explicit, clear, and logical explanation of how the Road Home \nformula has caused a disproportionate impact on African Americans in receiving grants to \nrebuild, repair and return to their homes.  In particular, plaintiffs allege that:   \n•  U.S. Census data show that African Americans are more likely than whites to own homes \nwith lower property values, including comparable homes, and are more likely to receive \ngrants under the Road Home program based on the pre-storm value of their homes.  See \nCompl. ¶¶ 3-4, 53-55;  \n \n•  Nearly 80% of homes owned by African Americans in New Orleans were valued at less \nthan $100,000, compared to only about 33% homes owned by whites.  Compl. ¶ 54.  \n \n•  The Road Home formula disadvantages African American homeowners whose home \nproperty values are lower (when the cost of repair exceeds the pre-storm value), because \nthe formula awards grants based on the lower of the pre-storm value of the home or the \ncost of damage to the home.  Compl. ¶¶ 3-4, 45-53, 55.  \n \n•  Because of the formula, African American homeowners are more likely than white \nhomeowners to have a gap between the cost of rebuilding and their rebuilding resources \n(including grants), and the average gap for African American applicants is far larger than \nthe average gap for white applicants.  Compl. ¶¶ 56-57.   \n \n \n53\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 65 of 77\n \nThese factual allegations, which the “court must accept as true,” create far more than a \n“reasonable inference” or a “sheer possibility” that HUD’s formula has disproportionately \nimpacted African Americans.  Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949.27  Accepting as true Plaintiffs’ factual \nallegations that African Americans own homes with lower property values than whites (including \nwhen their homes are comparable); that the Road Home formula provides smaller awards to \nhomeowners whose property values are lower (when the cost of repair is higher than the pre-\nstorm value); and that this formula causes African Americans to have more frequent and larger \nshortfalls in funding needed to rebuild their homes than whites, the most logical conclusion—not \nonly a reasonable conclusion—is that the formula has caused a disparate impact on African \nAmericans, as Plaintiffs explicitly allege.  See Compl. ¶¶ 3-4, 52-59.  Thus, Plaintiffs have \nalleged facts that far surpass those necessary to satisfy Rule 8(a)’s pleading requirements.  \nMoreover, contrary to HUD’s contention that Plaintiffs “fail to allege that African American \nhomeowners experience a disparate impact in the amount they allegedly received under the Road \nHome grant award as compared to white homeowners,” HUD Br. 42, these facts clearly allege \nthat the formula caused African American homeowners to receive smaller grant awards than \nwhite homeowners under the Road Home program, causing more frequent and larger gaps in the \ncost to rebuild.  See Compl. ¶¶ 3-4, 52-58.28 \n                                                 \n27 The Court’s discussion in Iqbal about what factual allegations a plaintiff must make in \norder to sufficiently plead a Bivens claim of intentional discrimination under the Fifth \nAmendment, Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1948-49, 1951-52, is obviously inapplicable to Plaintiffs’ \ndisparate impact claim under Title VIII.  Plaintiffs need not allege or ultimately prove at trial \nthat HUD acted with discriminatory intent or purpose.  See 2922 Sherman Ave., 444 F.3d at 681. \n28 Contrary to HUD’s unsupported assertion, Plaintiffs need not allege discrimination in the \nmethod of home appraisals or the Road Home policy that allows grantees to use their own \nappraisers.  See HUD Br. 42-43.  Plaintiffs can adequately plead their claim without making \nthese two allegations, as detailed above.  In any event, it is common knowledge that racial \ndisparities in home values can occur without a biased appraiser or method of appraisal, because \nan appraisal compares a particular home to similar homes in the same area that have been sold at \n \n54\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 66 of 77\n \n  In addition, HUD contends that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for a violation of \n§ 3605(a) of Title VIII because “Plaintiffs do not allege, nor could they allege, that HUD \nengaged in residential real estate transactions with anyone.”  HUD Br. 43.  HUD’s argument is \nmisguided.  The statute defines the term “residential real estate-related transaction” to include \n“[t]he making or purchasing of loans or providing other financial assistance . . . for purchasing, \nconstructing, improving, repairing, or maintaining a dwelling.”  42 U.S.C. § 3605(b)(1)(A).  Not \nsurprisingly, HUD provides no authority for its apparent claim that HUD’s approval of the \ndisbursement of federal funds to homeowners who seek to repair damage caused by Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita does not constitute “providing . . . financial assistance” for “constructing, \nimproving, repairing, or maintaining a dwelling.”  Id.  In fact, the case law requires a far less \ndirect connection between the defendant’s financial assistance and the homeowner than HUD \nwishes to impose.  See Nat’l Fair Hous. Alliance, 208 F. Supp. 2d at 58 (holding that property \ninsurance is covered by § 3605 because “insurance provides the financial assistance necessary to \nmaintain a dwelling”); United States v. Mass. Indus. Fin. Agency, 910 F. Supp. 21, 29 (D. Mass. \n1996) (“Defendant’s argument that it does not provide ‘financial assistance’ because it does not \nprovide funds directly to applicants is unconvincing.”). \nFinally, HUD argues that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim that HUD violated its \naffirmative obligations under § 3608(e)(5) of Title VIII and § 5304(b)(2) of the HCDA.  See \nHUD Br. 44-45.  This argument rests on the contention that § 3608(e)(5) and § 5304(b)(2) \nrequire only that HUD consider the effect of its decisions on fair housing.  HUD Br. 44.  But \n                                                                                                                                                             \na market rate, and market rates are influenced by racial discrimination in our broader society.  \nSimilarly meritless is HUD’s assertion that Plaintiffs must allege the Additional Compensation \nGrants create statistical disparities in the award of grants.  HUD Br. 43.  Plaintiffs allege that the \nAdditional Compensation Grant “does not eliminate the discriminatory disparities in grant \namounts” that are caused by the general grant formula.

Compl. ¶¶ 3-4, 45-56.  These facts are sufficient to state a claim that HUD failed \nto act affirmatively to promote open housing in New Orleans. \n2.  Rainwater’s motion to dismiss must be denied because Plaintiffs have \nalleged sufficient facts to state a Title VIII disparate impact claim. \nRainwater also contends that Plaintiffs’ Title VIII claims must be dismissed under Rule \n12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim.  Rainwater first argues that Plaintiffs have not alleged a \nviolation of § 3605(a) because Rainwater has not engaged in any residential real estate-related \ntransactions.  Rainwater Br. 31.  This argument must be rejected for the same reasons discussed \nsupra Part II.C.1.  The statute specifically defines real estate-related transactions to include \nfinancial assistance “for improving, repairing, or maintaining a dwelling.”  42 U.S.C. \n§ 3605(b)(1)(A).  The Complaint plainly alleges that the Road Home program provides financial \nassistance for home improvement and repair, and that Rainwater’s design and implementation of \nthat program has a disparate impact on African Americans.  Compl. ¶¶ 43-60. \nRainwater also argues that Plaintiffs’ Title VIII claims must be dismissed because \nPlaintiffs “have not and cannot allege that African American and white homeowners with \n \n56\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 68 of 77\n \nsubstantially similar home values were treated differently” due to the application of the Road \nHome formula.29  Rainwater Br. 32-33.  This argument fundamentally misunderstands the \nappropriate legal standard. \nIn order to allege a disparate impact violation under Title VIII, a plaintiff need only \nallege facts sufficient to demonstrate that a facially-neutral policy has a significant adverse \nimpact on members of a protected group.  See NCRC, 573 F. Supp. 2d at 79.  Plaintiffs therefore \nneed only allege facts to show that application of the Road Home formula has had a \ndiscriminatory effect on African American homeowners—Plaintiffs do not need to allege that a \nsimilarly-situated group was treated differently under the Road Home program.  See id. \n(expressly rejecting the defendant’s argument in a Title VIII disparate impact claim that the \nplaintiff failed to allege the existence of a similarly-situated class); see also Charleston Hous. \nAuth. v. USDA, 419 F.3d 729, 741 (8th Cir. 2005) (rejecting housing authority’s argument that \nthe plaintiffs’ disparate impact claims fail because they did not demonstrate that similarly-\nsituated individuals were treated differently, and noting that plaintiffs “need prove no more than \nthat the conduct of the defendant actually or predictably results in discrimination”). \nRainwater asserts that 2922 Sherman Avenue is to the contrary, see Rainwater Br. 32, but \nthat case specifically declined to consider the defendant’s argument that plaintiffs needed to \nprovide evidence of a relevant comparison group.  See 2922 Sherman Ave., 444 F.3d at 681.30  \nBut Rainwater makes an even more fundamental error.  According to Rainwater, Plaintiffs must \n                                                 \n29 While HUD appears to make a version of this argument in its Preliminary Statement, see \nHUD Br. 3, HUD never makes this point in its Argument.  See HUD Br. 42.  In any event, as \ndiscussed in this section, this argument is meritless.  \n30 The court in 2922 Sherman Avenue did vacate a jury verdict in favor of the plaintiffs on \ntheir disparate impact claim, but that reversal was based on the plaintiffs’ failure, at trial, to \nprove statistically significant disparities that adversely affected Hispanics.  2922 Sherman Ave., \n444 F.3d at 681.  Of course, as discussed above, this case is not yet at the stage of determining \nthe sufficiency of evidence presented at trial.  See supra Part II.C.1.  \n \n57\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 69 of 77\n \nfind white and African American homeowners with “substantially the same property value” and \ndemonstrate that the white homeowners were treated more favorably.  Rainwater Br. 33.  But the \nuse of property value in the Road Home formula is the very practice alleged to be discriminatory, \nso it would be nonsensical to compare homeowners on whom the practice has no differentiating \neffect.  As the D.C. Circuit put it in the very case Rainwater cites, “[i]f we were to require that \nthe very factor that causes disparate impact be included in the comparison . . . , we would \neffectively define disparate impact analysis out of existence.”  Anderson v. Zubieta, 180 F.3d \n329, 342 (D.C. Cir. 1999), cited in Rainwater Br. 32.   \nBecause, as noted supra Part II.C.1, Plaintiffs have adequately alleged that the Road \nHome program has a disproportionate adverse effect on African American homeowners, \nRainwater’s argument must be rejected.  Compl. ¶¶ 3-4, 45-60, 74-76; see NCRC, 573 F. Supp. \n2d at 79. \nD.  The individual Plaintiffs did not waive their right to sue. \nRainwater finally contends in a footnote that by signing a Grant Agreement and accepting \ngrant awards, the individual Plaintiffs are required to raise any disputes through a state-level \nadministrative appeals process.  See Rainwater Br. 24 n.6.  But that administrative review \nprocess is expressly limited to reviewing homeowner challenges to grant awards and eligibility.  \nSee The Road Home, Appeals and Second Disbursements 1 (Ex. H) (“You have the right to \nappeal . . . [the] award decision.  You can appeal: Eligibility decisions; amount of benefit \ncompensation . . .; [d]enial of Additional Compensation Grant.”); The Road Home, Filing an \nAppeal 1 (Ex. I) (“If you believe the program’s determination of your funding award calculation \nor your eligibility status is incorrect . . . you can file a formal appeal . . . .”).  Plaintiffs do not \nargue that their grant was incorrectly calculated or that they were improperly found to be \nineligible.  Plaintiffs argue instead that the program, as designed and operated, had the illegal \n \n58\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 70 of 77\n \neffect of discriminating against them because they are African American.  Compl. ¶¶ 3-4, 45-60.   \nThis is a challenge that the appeals process expressly disclaims any authority to resolve: “The \nAppeals Office will not change policies or laws set forth by the State of Louisiana or the federal \ngovernment.”  The Road Home, Filing an Appeal 1 (Ex. I).  Rainwater cannot plausibly contend \nthat Plaintiffs’ only remedy for racial discrimination is through an administrative review process \nthat claims no ability to redress or even consider those claims. \nEven if the Grant Agreement were read to waive the individual Plaintiffs’ right to sue, \nthat waiver would be invalid under the appropriations statutes that created the CDBG Disaster \nRecovery Grant program (and that funded the Road Home program).  Those Acts provide that \nthe use of disaster recovery funds is subject to the requirements that govern the regular CDBG \nprogram, and that HUD can waive “any provision of any statute or regulation that the Secretary \nadministers . . . except for requirements related to fair housing, nondiscrimination, labor \nstandards, and the environment.”  2005 Act, 119 Stat. at 2780 (emphasis added); see also 2006 \nAct, 120 Stat. at 472-73 (same).  A requirement that purported to force Plaintiffs to raise fair \nhousing and nondiscrimination claims exclusively in a state administrative proceeding so ill-\nsuited for that purpose would violate this term of the federal appropriations acts and, thus, would \nbe unenforceable. \nEach of the individual Plaintiffs is therefore properly before this Court, because the Grant \nAgreement does not waive the right to sue for Rainwater’s violation of Title VIII and the HCDA, \nand because reading the Grant Agreement to constitute such a waiver would violate the federal \nstatutes establishing the CDBG Disaster Recovery Grant program. \n* * * \n \n59\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 71 of 77\n \nPlaintiffs’ claims that HUD and Rainwater violated Title VIII and the HCDA are \nenforceable against both Defendants and reviewable by this Court, and Plaintiffs have alleged \nsufficient facts to state a claim.  The motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Rule \n12(b)(6) should be denied. \nIII.  Rainwater’s motion to transfer should be denied because Rainwater has failed to \ncarry his heavy burden of establishing that this Court should disturb Plaintiffs’ \nchoice of forum. \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), this Court may transfer this action out of the District of \nColumbia only if Rainwater establishes that plaintiffs initially could have brought this action in \nthe Middle District of Louisiana, and considerations of convenience and the interests of justice \nweigh in favor of transfer to that district.  See Shenandoah Assocs. Ltd. P’ship v. Tirana, 182 F. \nSupp. 2d 14, 25 (D.D.C. 2001).  A court should not transfer a case from a plaintiff’s chosen \nforum “simply because another forum, in the court’s view, may be superior to that chosen by the \nplaintiff.”  Pain v. United Tech. Corp., 637 F.2d 775, 783 (D.C. Cir. 1980).  Instead, courts \nshould weigh a number of case-specific factors, including the private interests of the parties and \nwitnesses, and public interests such as efficiency and fairness.  Wilderness Soc’y v. Babbitt, 104 \nF. Supp. 2d 10, 12 (D.D.C. 2000). \nAlthough Plaintiffs agree that this action could have been filed in the Middle District of \nLouisiana or the Eastern District of Louisiana, see 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e), Rainwater has failed to \nmeet his heavy burden of demonstrating that the balance of interests favors transfer.  Pain, 637 \nF.2d at 784.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ choice of forum should not be disturbed.      \nA.  Rainwater has not demonstrated that the private interests of the parties and \nwitnesses weigh in favor of transferring this case.  \nDistrict courts weigh a number of private-interest factors in determining whether transfer \nis warranted, including the plaintiffs’ choice of forum, the defendants’ choice of forum, the \n \n60\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 72 of 77\n \nforum in which the claim arose, the convenience of the parties and witnesses, and the ease of \naccess to sources of proof.  See Wilderness Soc’y, 104 F. Supp. 2d at 12; Trout Unlimited v. \nUSDA, 944 F. Supp. 13, 16 (D.D.C. 1996)). \nThe first of these factors—the plaintiffs’ choice of forum—is often dispositive.  It is well \nestablished that a plaintiff’s choice of forum “should be afforded substantial deference unless \nthat forum has no substantial connection with the parties or subject matter at issue.”  Initiative & \nReferendum Inst. v. U.S. Postal Serv., 154 F. Supp. 2d 10, 14 (D.D.C. 2001); see also Wilderness \nSoc’y, 104 F. Supp. 2d at 12-13 (collecting cases).  Rainwater argues that Plaintiffs’ choice of \nforum “deserves little deference” because “none of the named Plaintiffs reside in the District of \nColumbia.”  Rainwater Br. 42.  This assertion is false.  Plaintiff National Fair Housing Alliance \n(“NFHA”) has its principal place of business in the District of Columbia, and is thus a resident of \nthe District of Columbia.  Compl. ¶ 12.  This Court has held that even when only one plaintiff is \na resident of the chosen forum, the court should afford substantial deference to the plaintiffs’ \nchoice of forum.  See Sierra Club v. Van Antwerp, 523 F. Supp. 2d 5, 11 (D.D.C. 2007).  \n  Rainwater further contends that Plaintiffs’ choice of forum should be given little \ndeference, because “most, if not all, of the relevant events concerning Plaintiffs’ Road Home \ngrant applications” took place in Louisiana.  Rainwater Br. 42.  This argument is also incorrect.  \nPlaintiffs’ Complaint alleges relevant events that occurred in the District of Columbia, including \nHUD’s assisting LRA in designing the Road Home grant formula and HUD’s review, approval, \nand continuing oversight.  Compl. ¶¶ 49-51; see also Kome Decl. ¶¶ 1, 13-24. \nThis Court’s decision in Greater Yellowstone Coalition v. Bosworth, 180 F. Supp. 2d 124 \n(D.D.C. 2001) is instructive.  In Bosworth, several environmental groups alleged that the United \nStates Forest Service failed to comply with certain federal statutes when it renewed a cattle-\n \n61\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 73 of 77\n \ngrazing permit for forest land in Montana without assessing the environmental impact of the \nrenewal.  Id. at 126.  The defendants moved to transfer the action to the District of Montana on \nthe ground that the decision to issue the permit and the effects of such a decision are inherently \nrelated to Montana, not the District of Columbia.  Id. at 128.  This Court denied the defendants’ \nmotion, concluding that because federal government officials in the District of Columbia were \ninvolved in the decision to reissue the permit and two of the five plaintiffs had offices in the \nDistrict of Columbia, the action had a sufficient nexus to this forum.  Id. at 128-29.  The Court \ndistinguished other cases involving federal agencies that had been transferred out of the District \nof Columbia, noting that in those cases, “none of the plaintiffs resided in the District of \nColumbia and none of the decisionmaking occurred in the District of Columbia.”  Id. at 129 \n(discussing Trout Unlimited and Hawksbill Sea Turtle v. FEMA, 939 F. Supp. 1 (D.D.C. 1996)). \nRainwater’s reliance on Al-Ahmed v. Chertoff, 564 F. Supp. 2d 16 (D.D.C. 2008), is \nmisplaced.  See Rainwater Br. 39.  Al-Ahmed granted the defendants’ motion to transfer because \nthe plaintiff was a Virginia resident, all of the administrative decisions at issue were made in \nVirginia, and the “only real connection [the] lawsuit has to the District of Columbia is that a \nfederal agency headquartered here is charged with generally regulating and overseeing the \n[administrative] process . . . .”  Al-Ahmed, 564 F. Supp. 2d at 19 (citations omitted).  Plaintiffs \nhere have alleged not that HUD is generally charged with regulating the administrative process, \nbut rather that HUD officials in the District of Columbia made specific decisions in the design \nand approval of the Road Home program that have resulted in a discriminatory disparate impact.  \nDespite Rainwater’s contention to the contrary, the fact that this litigation also has a \nconnection to Louisiana does not compel a transfer to the Middle District of Louisiana.  Cf. \nIngram v. Eli Lilly & Co., 251 F. Supp. 2d 1, 7 (D.D.C. 2003) (holding that although litigation \n \n62\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 74 of 77\n \n“admittedly has a greater connection to Washington [state],” plaintiff’s choice of the District of \nColumbia as its forum should not be disturbed).     \nNone of the other private interest factors weighs in favor of transferring this case to the \nMiddle District of Louisiana.  Although Rainwater asserts that such a transfer will be “more \nconvenient” for the parties, Rainwater Br. 42, Plaintiff NFHA and Defendant HUD are in the \nDistrict of Columbia, and many of the relevant documents and witnesses are therefore located in \nthis forum.  While some of the plaintiffs do reside in Louisiana, this Court should defer to their \njudgment regarding where to file their lawsuit.  See Wilderness Soc’y, 104 F. Supp. 2d at 15 \n(noting that although some of the plaintiffs were located in Alaska, they “presumably do not \nconsider the District of Columbia to be an inconvenient forum or else they would not have sued \nhere”).  And although Rainwater is located in Baton Rouge, he has failed to proffer any evidence \nto demonstrate that it would be an undue hardship for him to litigate this case in the District of \nColumbia.  See Robinson v. Eli Lilly & Co., 535 F. Supp. 2d 49, 52 (D.D.C. 2008) (denying \ntransfer motion where the defendant “neither articulated nor demonstrated hardship for it as a \ncorporate party to have to travel to this district for these proceedings”).  Nor has Rainwater \nshown that “any lay or expert witnesses will refuse to appear in this district for trial or cannot \nhave their testimony preserved by videotaped deposition.”  Id.  Moreover, although Rainwater \nvaguely asserts that “documents and materials concerning Plaintiffs’ Road Home grant \napplications are located in Baton Rouge,” it is uncontested that—in light of Plaintiffs’ claims \nagainst HUD—other documents relevant to this litigation are located in the District of Columbia.  \nB.  Rainwater has not demonstrated that public interests weigh in favor of \ntransferring this case. \nTransfer is also unwarranted in light of the public interests at issue in this action.  District \ncourts review a number of public-interest factors in considering a motion to transfer, including \n \n63\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 75 of 77\n \nthe transferee court’s familiarity with the governing laws, the relative congestion of the \ntransferor and transferee courts’ calendars, and any local interests in deciding local controversies.  \nTrout Unlimited, 944 F. Supp. at 16.  Rainwater has failed to demonstrate that any of these \ninterests weigh in favor of transferring this action to the Middle District of Louisiana.   \nFirst, Rainwater’s contention that the Middle District of Louisiana is “equally familiar \nwith the federal laws governing Plaintiffs’ claims” is of no moment.  Rainwater Br. 43.  The \napplicable standard is not whether the transferee court is “equally familiar” with the governing \nlaws, but whether the transferee court has some sort of expertise that the transferor court does \nnot, such that there is an advantage to having the transferee court resolve the dispute.  See \nWilderness Soc’y, 104 F. Supp. 2d at 16; Trout Unlimited, 944 F. Supp. at 19.  Here, none of \nPlaintiffs’ claims involves an issue of Louisiana state law, and there is thus “no advantage to \nhaving a federal court ‘thoroughly familiar and experienced’ in the state law of [Louisiana] \nadjudicate this suit.”  Wilderness Soc’y, 104 F. Supp. 2d at 16 (quoting Trout Unlimited, 944 F. \nSupp. at 19).  It is axiomatic that the Middle District of Louisiana is no better suited than this \nCourt to resolve Plaintiffs’ federal statutory claims.  See Miller v. Insulation Contractors, No. \n08-1556, 2009 WL 1066263, at *3 (D.D.C. Apr. 21, 2009) (“[A]ll federal courts are presumed to \nbe equally familiar with the law governing federal statutory claims.”).    \n  Second, Rainwater’s assertion that there is “no evidence that Plaintiffs’ case would \nproceed more quickly in the District of Columbia,” Rainwater Br. 43, improperly shifts the \nburden of proof to Plaintiffs to demonstrate that the District of Columbia is the most appropriate \nforum.  This simply is not the law.  It is Rainwater’s burden to demonstrate that public interests, \nsuch as the relative congestion of the courts, favor transferring the case.  See SEC v. Savoy \n \n64\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 76 of 77\n \nIndus., Inc., 587 F.2d 1149, 1154 (D.C. Cir. 1978).  Rainwater has not established that this \nCourt’s docket is significantly heavier than the docket in the Middle District of Louisiana.    \nFinally, Rainwater contends that the Middle District of Louisiana has a stronger local \ninterest in resolving this case because the litigation involves “Louisiana properties” and \n“Louisiana residents.”  Rainwater Br. 43-44.  But, as noted, this litigation also has significant ties \nto the District of Columbia.  In addition, all of Plaintiffs’ claims are based on violations of \nfederal law, and this Court has held that where one issue in the suit is “whether federal agencies \ncomplied with federal law,” the case cannot have a “purely local impact” in another forum.  \nSierra Club, 523 F. Supp. 2d at 13.  This is especially true because both Title VIII and the \nHCDA reflect national policies.  See id.; see also 42 U.S.C. § 3601 (“It is the policy of the \nUnited States to provide, within constitutional limitations, for fair housing throughout the United \nStates.”); 42 U.S.C. § 5301(b) (“The Congress . . . finds and declares that the future welfare of \nthe Nation and the well-being of its citizens depend on the establishment and maintenance of \nviable urban communities as social, economic, and political entities . . . .”). \nBecause Rainwater has failed to demonstrate that the balance of private and public \ninterests favors a transfer of this action to the Middle District of Louisiana, the motion to transfer \nshould be denied. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated herein, the Court should deny HUD’s motion to dismiss (Dkt. 22), \nRainwater’s motion to dismiss (Dkt. 28), and Rainwater’s motion to transfer (Dkt. 28). \n \n65\n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 34    Filed 06/05/09   Page 77 of 77\n \nDated: June 5, 2009.

The Relief Sought by Plaintiffs Falls Outside the Scope of the Ex Parte Young \nException  to The Eleventh Amendment’s General Prohibition  of Suits  \nAgainst a State by its Own Citizens             \n \n  Although Ex Parte Young , 209 U.S. 123  (1908), provides an exception to Eleventh \nAmendment immunity in suits involving the actions of state officials, it is well settled that “[t]he \nEleventh Amendment bars a suit against state officials when the state is the real, substantial party \nin interest.” Pennhurst State School & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 101–02 (1984).  In this \ncase, Rainwater cannot be the real party in interest because he lacked authority over  The Road \nHome compensation grant formula that is the alleged source of  Plaintiffs’ damages.  As will be \ndemonstrated by statute and by  Plaintiffs’ own admissions, the Louisiana  Recovery Authority \n(“LRA”) was solely responsible for the development and implementation of  The Road Home \ncompensation grant formula at issue in this l itigation.  As such, Ex Parte Young cannot permit \nPlaintiffs to circumvent the Eleventh Amendment. \nPlaintiffs, in their Opposition Memorandum, concede the LRA is the real party in interest \nin this action and not Rainwater, stating:   \nThe Louisiana Recovery  Authority (“LRA”) is a Louisiana state \nagency created to administer funds for recovery from Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita, including CDBG Disaster Recovery Grant Funds.  \nDefendant, Paul Rainwater, is the LRA’s Executive Director.   \n \n(Complaint, Dkt. 1,  ¶ 19;  Plaintiffs’ Opposition, Dkt. 34, p. 4.)  \n  1 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 39    Filed 07/08/09   Page 11 of 51\n \n  Plaintiffs further concede the LRA, and not Rainwater, is responsible for proposing and \ndeveloping the Road Home grant formula and details of The Road Home program that is at issue \nin this lawsuit.  Plaintiffs admit “the LRA proposed and developed the Road Home grant formula \nand details the  Road Home program in consultation with HUD and subject to HUD’s on -going \napproval and oversight.” (Complaint, Dkt. 1, ¶¶ 49-51, Plaintiffs’ Opposition, Dkt.. 34, p. 4.)1  \nFinally, Plaintiffs again ignore the language contained in their Exhibit A to the Opposition \nMemorandum, which provides that “ [t]he Louisiana Recovery Authority (“LRA”) has be en \ncharged by the Governor and Louisiana legislature with statutory responsibility for developing \npolicy and the required actions.” (Plaintiffs’ Opposition, Dkt. 34-3, p. 3.)2 \n  The declaration of Jesse Handforth Kome  submitted in support of the Defendant HUD’s \nMotion to Dismiss further bolsters Rainwater’s contention that the LRA is solely responsible for \nthe development and implementation of the Road Home grant formula. (Kome Declaration, Dkt.  \n22-2.)  Ms. Kome is the Deputy Director, Office of Block Grant Assistance (“OBGA”), Office of \nCommunity Planning and Development (“CPD”), U.S. Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment (“HUD”). (Kome Declaration, Dkt. 22-2, ¶1.)   Ms. Kome submits the following: \nThe Road Home Program is administered by the State of Louisiana \nthrough the Louisiana Office of Community Development and the \nLouisiana Recovery Authority and is funded by HUD through the \nCDBG Program.  The State of Louisiana is responsible for the \nimplementation, design, and administration of the Road Home \nProgram in conformance with the applicable CDBG Program \nrequirements set by HUD.   \n   \n                                                \n1   “Homeowners who agree to use Road Home funds to rebuild or repair their homes are eligible for grants of up to \n$150,000.”  (Complaint, Dkt. 1, ¶¶ 45-46.)  “The grant amount is calculated using the lower of two baseline values:  \nthe home’s pre-storm or the cost of damage to the home.”  (Complaint, Dkt. 1, ¶ 47.)   \n2   “Governor Kathleen Babineaux Blanco has prioritized housing redevelopment, infrastructure rehabilitation, and \neconomic development as the primary uses of the two supplemental appropriations.  The supplement CDBG \nrecovery funds are available to the state subject to HUD approval of action plans, which describe how the funds wil l\nbe used … Louisiana Office of Community Development, the agency that administers the state’s annual CDBG \nprogram, would administer the supplemental CDBG recovery program.” (Plaintiffs’ Opposition, Dkt. 34-3, p. 3.) \n  2 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 39    Filed 07/08/09   Page 12 of 51\n \nAs it developed, the Road Home Program, Louisiana ultimately \nchose to provide compensation and incentive grants to eligible \nhomeowners affected by Hurricanes Katrina or Ri ta, of up to \n$150,000.  Louisiana decided to base the amount of the \ncompensation and incentive grants on the lower of the pre -storm, \nfair market value of the home, or the cost to repair the home.   \n \n(Kome Declaration, Dkt.  22-2, ¶18.) (emphasis added). \nThe fact that a senior government official with HUD has confirmed that “[t]he State of Louisiana \nis responsible for the implementation, design, and administration of the  Road Home program,”  \nand not Rainwater, further corroborates that Rainwater had no authority in the creation and \nimplementation of the Road Home grant f ormula. (Kome Declaration,  Dkt. 22-2, ¶15.)  Thus, \nPlaintiffs’ claims are only against Rainwater in name and  against the LRA and the State of \nLouisiana in actuality. \nPlaintiffs cannot pierce the shield of the Eleventh Amendment immunity simply by \nnaming as defendant a party other than the State.  Looking to substance rather than form, the \nSupreme Court has decid ed that such immunity should not depend on “the mere names of the \ntitular parties but (on) the essential nature and effect of the proceeding, as it appears from the \nentire record.”  Sheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 237 (1974), overruled on other grounds, Davis \nv. Scherer, 468 U.S. 183 (1984) (citing Ex Parte New York , 256 U.S. 490, 500 (1921) ). “The \nEleventh Amendment bars a suit against state officials  when “the state is the real, substantial \nparty in interest.” Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp.,  465 U.S. at 101–02 (citing Ford Motor Co. v. \nDepartment of Treasury,  323 U.S. 459, 464 (1945). The United States Supreme Court has \n“previously held that the nature o f a suit as one against the state is to be determined by the \nessential nature and effect of the proceeding.”  Ford Motor Co., 323 U.S. at 463–64.  The LRA, \nnot Rainwater, is the real, substantial party in interest in this case.  \n  3 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 39    Filed 07/08/09   Page 13 of 51\n \n\"The general rule is that re lief sought nominally against an officer is in fact against the \nsovereign if the decree would operate against the latter.”  Vann v. Kempthorne, 534 F.3d 741 , \n754–55 n.5 (D.C. Cir. 2008)  (citing State of Hawaii v.  Gordon, 373 U.S. 57, 58  (1963)).  “[A] \nsuit is against the sovereign if the judgment sought would expend itself on the public treasury or \ndomain, or interfere with the public administration, or if the effect of the judgment would be 'to \nrestrain the Government from acting, or to compel  it to act.” Id. (citing Pennhurst State Sch. & \nHosp., 465 U.S. at 101 n. 11).  Plaintiffs’ claims against Rainwater create analogous concerns. \nThe relief Plaintiffs seek would clearly operate against the State of Louisiana through the \nLRA.  The Federal Government provided Louisiana with Community Development Block Grant \n(CDBG) funds.  These funds were distributed by the LRA to  hurricane affected residents of \nLouisiana.  Plaintiffs’ lawsuit will significantly interfere with Louisiana’s administration of the \nfunds provided by the Federal Government to aid its residents.   Further, the effect of a judgment \nin favor of Plaintiffs would be to compel the state government, through the LRA, to act because \nit is the statutory responsibility of the LRA, not Rainwater, to administer Road Home grant \nfunds. \nPlaintiffs contend that  Ex Parte Young provides no shield for a state official confronted \nby a claim that he deprived another of a federal righ t under the color of state law.  However, the \ninstant case is distinguishable from Ex Parte Young, where the Supreme Court observed: \nIn making an officer of the state a party defendant in a suit to \nenjoin the enforcement of an act alleged to be unconstitutional, it is \nplain that such officer must have  some connection with the \nenforcement of the act, or else it is merely making him a party as a \nrepresentative of the state and, thereby  attempting to make the \nstate a party. \n* * *  \nThe fact that the state offic er, by virtue of his office, has some \nconnection with the enforcement of the act, is the important and \nmaterial fact, and whether it arises out of the general law, or is \n  4 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 39    Filed 07/08/09   Page 14 of 51\n \nspecially created by the act itself, is not material so long as it \nexists. \n \nEx Parte Young, 209 U.S. at 157 (emphasis added).  Therefore, unless the state officer has some \nresponsibility to enforce the statute or provision at issue, the “fiction” of  Ex Parte Young cannot \noperate. \n  In Children’s Health Care is a Legal Duty, Inc. v. Deters , 92 F.3d 1412, 1422 (6th Cir. \n1996), the Sixth Circuit held that absent enforcement or threatened enforcement by the Attorney \nGeneral, an action against the Attorney General was precluded by the Ele venth Amendment.  \nThe court held: \nConsistent with the Young requirement of action on the part of the \nstate official, we note that the phrase “some connection with the \nenforcement of the act” does not diminish the requirement that the \nofficial threatened and be about to commence proceedings.  \n \nChildren’s Health Care, 92 F3d at 1416 (citing  Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. at 155-56).  “General \nauthority to enforce the laws of the state is not sufficient to make government officials the proper \nparties to litigation challenging the law.”    1st Westco Corporation v. School District of \nPhiladelphia, 6 F.3d 108, 113 (3d Cir. 1993) (citations omitted).  Holding that a state official’s \nobligation to execute the laws is sufficient connection to the enforcement of a challenged statute \nwould extend  Ex Parte  Young beyond what the Supreme Court has intended and held.    See \nWeinstein v. Edgar, 826 F.Supp. 1165, 1167 (N.D. Ill. 1993) ; Mendez v. Heller, 530 F.2d 457, \n460 (2d Cir. 1976)   (holding  an attorney general’s duty to support the constitutionality of \nchallenged state statutes and his duty to defend actions in which the state is interested do not \nconstitute enforcement of the statute  in question); see also, Shell Oil Co. v. Noel, 608 F.2d 208, \n211 (1st Cir. 1979) (citing Gras v. Stevens, 415 F.Supp. 1148, 1152 (S.D.NY 1976))(holding the \n  5 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 39    Filed 07/08/09   Page 15 of 51\n \nmere fact that a governor is under a general duty to enforce state law does not make him a proper \nparty defendant in every action attacking the constitutionality of a state statute).  \n  “Of critical importance are the nature of the statute and the state officer’s connection with \nthat statute.”   Shell Oil Co. v. Noel , 608 F.2d 208 , 212 (1st Cir. 1979).   In the instant case, \nPlaintiffs seek an injunction against a state officer, Rainwater, alleging that his actions violate \nseveral federal statutes.  ( Plaintiffs’ Opposition, Dkt. 34, p. 31.)  However, Rainwater  did not \nhave any responsibility or authority for the development and implementation of  The Road Home \ncompensation  grant  formula at issue .   To the contrary,  Plaintiffs admit   this was the  sole \nresponsibility of the LRA. (Complaint, Dkt. 1,  ¶¶ 49-51, Plaintiffs’ Opposition, Dkt.  34, p. 4.)  \nMoreover, unlike the Minnesota Attorney General in Ex Parte Young, Rainwater did not threaten \nto commence, and was not ab out to commence, proceedings against  Plaintiffs much less \nproceedings to enforce an allegedly unconstitutional act.  Plaintiffs allege that The Road Home’s \ngrant formula is discriminatory.  But Rainwater is not the proper party to answer to this alleged \ndiscrimination because he was not responsible for the development or implementation of the \nformula.3  Plaintiffs have “manufactured” a cause of action against Rainwater in a direct attempt \nto circumvent the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution.   \n  Rainwater’s only connection to the development of the grant formula is derived from his \ngeneral obligation as Executive Director of the Louisiana Recovery Authority.  La. Rev.  Stat. \nAnn. § 49:220.5(d).  However, the U.S. Supreme Court in Fitts v. McGhee, 172 U.S. 516 (1899), \nrejected a threat of liability predicated on a governor’s general obl igations as a executive of the \nstate and held this was insufficient to avoid the consequences of the Eleventh Amendment.   See \n                                                \n3   Paul Rainwater assumed the position of the Executive Director of the LRA in January 2008, after the design and \nimplementation of The Road Home compensation grant program at issue had been completed.  Further, Rainwater \ndid not sign any applications or certifications for the receipt of CDBG funds; instead, all contracts with HUD were \nauthorized and signed by the Division of Administration, an agency of the State of Louisiana .\n  6 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 39    Filed 07/08/09   Page 16 of 51\n \nalso Akron Center for Reproductive Health v. Rosen , 633 F.Supp. 1123, 1129–30 (M.D. Ohio  \n1986), reversed on other grounds, 497 U.S. 502 (1990) ; Hatfield v. Williams, 376 F.Supp. 212, \n214 (N.D. Iowa 1974); Sherman v. Community Consol. Sch. Dist. 21, 980 F.2d 437, 441 (7th Cir. \n1992), cert. denied, 508 U.S. 950 (1993) (holding attorney general’s general supervisory power \ninsufficient to establish the connection with enforcement required by  Ex Parte Young); Long v. \nVan De Camp, 961 F.2d 151, 152 (9th Cir. 1992). \n  “[I]n  Fitts, the Supreme Court articulated the requirement that there be a ‘close’ \nconnection or a ‘special relation’ between the statute and the defendant state officer's duty before \nthe Eleventh Amendment bar could be overcome.”  Okpalobi v. Foster, 244 F.3d 405, 413  (5th \nCir. 2001) (citing Fitts , 172 U.S at 529 –30).  “Fitts ill uminated the important precept that \nallowing state officers to be sued in lieu of the State absent some ‘special connection’ would \npermit the narrow exception to swallow the fundamental, constitutionally-based rule.” Id. \n  The other case on which P laintiffs rely,  Vann v. Kempthorne, 534 F.3d 741 (D.C. Cir. \n2008), is also distinguishable from the case at bar because the duties and responsibilities of the \ndefendants in  Vann are fundamen tally different from duties and responsibilities of Rainwater.   \nAs recognized by this Court in  Vann, Ex Parte Young only permits courts to “direct affirmative \naction where the [state] officer having some duty to perform not involving discretion, but merely \nministerial in its nature, refuses or neglects to take such action.” Vann, 534 F.3d at 752 (citing Ex \nParte Young, 209 U.S. at 158 ).  Unlike the Cherokee Chief and other tribal officers in  Vann, \nRainwater had no authority over or responsibility for the so urce of the  Plaintiffs’ injuries.  In \nVann, the plaintiff sought “an injunction preventing Chief Smith from holding further elections \nwithout a vote of all citizens, including [plaintiff].”  Vann, 534 F.3d at 754.    In this case, \nPlaintiffs seek to have  The Road Home  compensation grants recalculated.   The duty for the  \n  7 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 39    Filed 07/08/09   Page 17 of 51\n \ncompensation grant formula’s creation and implementation falls squarely on the LRA, not \nRainwater. La. Rev. Stat.  Ann. § 49:220.4 .4    Thus,  Plaintiffs’ are not seeking to compel \nRainwater to act.  In actuality, Plaintiffs wish to compel the LRA to act. \n  As Executive Director of the LRA, Rain water  did not and  does not have any \nresponsibility for  the design of  T he Road Home  compensation grant  f ormula. The statute \nempowering the LRA to implement the  Road Home program  only charges the Executive \nDirector with general responsibility to the governor and the LRA board. See La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \n§ 49:220.4. Rainwater has no special connection to the statute authorizing the LRA to create and \nimplement The Road Home grant formula.  Absent such a special connection, this Court should \nconclude that that the  Ex Parte Young  doctrine does not apply and find that the suit against \nRainwater is barred by the Eleventh Amendment. \nII.  Plaintiffs’ Complaint Fails to Establish a “Case or Controversy” Against \nRainwater Under Article III of the United States Constitution       \n \nUnder Article III of the Constitution, the federal courts have jurisdiction over a claim \nbetween a plaintiff and a defendant only if it presents a “case or controversy.” 5  Raines v. Byrd, \n521 U.S. 811, 818 (1997).  In this way, the power granted to federal courts under Article III “is \n                                                \n4   La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 49:220.4 states in pertinent part: \nA. (1) The Louisiana Recovery Authority is hereby created as a state agency within the office of the governor, \ndivision of administration. The authority shall be a body corporate with power to sue and be sued. The domicile of \nthe authority shall be in the parish of East Baton Rouge. The purpose of the authority shall be to recommend policy, \nplanning, and resource allocation affecting programs and services for the recovery, to implement programs and \nprovide services to the recovery, and to identify duplication of services relative to the recovery where appropriate .\nThe authority shall carry out its functions to support the most efficient and effective use of resources for the \nrecovery. \n(2) The board shall provide leadership and oversight for the activities of the authority. \n(3) The authority shall have an executive director who shall be appointed by the governor and subject to \nconfirmation by the Senate. The executive director shall serve at the pleasure of the governor and shall be paid a \nsalary which shall be fixed by the governor. The executive director shall be responsible to the governor and the \nboard. \n5   While the Eleventh Amendment is jurisdictional in the sense that it is a limitation on the federal court’s judicial \npower, and, therefore, can be raised at any stage of the proceedings, the Supreme Court has recognized that it is not \ncoextensive with the limitations on judicial power in Article III.  Calderon v. Ashmus, 523 U.S. 740 n. 2 (1998) \n(citing Idaho v. Coeur d’Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U.S. 261, 267, (1997)); Patsy v.Board of Regents of State of \nFlorida, 457 U.S. 496, 515 n. 19 (1982).  \n  8 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 39    Filed 07/08/09   Page 18 of 51\n \nnot an unconditioned authority to determine the constitutionality of legislative or executive acts.”  \nValley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., \n454 U.S. 464, 471 (1982).  \nIn order to establish a “case or controversy” sufficient to give a federal court jurisdiction \nover their claims,  Plaintiffs must satisfy three elements, which are said to constitute the \n“irreducible constitutional minimum”  of Article III.   Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife , 504 U.S.  \n555, 560 (1992).  First, they must show that they have suffered or are about to suffer “an injury \nin fact.”   Second, there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct \ncomplained of.  Third, it must be likely, as opposed to mere ly speculative, that the injury will be \nredressed by a favorable decision.   Id. at 561.  The party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the \nburden of establishing these three elements.   Id.  “These are not mere pleading requirements but \nan indispensable part of the plaintiff’s case.”   Id.  If any one of these three elements  – injury, \ncausation, redressability – is absent, Plaintiffs have no standing in federal court under Article III \nof the Constitution to assert their claim.   \nIn Lujan, environmental groups filed suit against the Secretary of the Interior challenging \ncertain provisions of the Endangered Species Act.   Id. at 559.  The Supreme Court held that the \nplaintiffs lacked standing and focused on the redressability prong of the “case or controversy” \ntest.  Id. at 569.  The Court reasoned that since  the plaintiffs attacked a decision of how to \nimplement specific government programs instead of the decision to fund the particular programs \ncausing them harm, the Secretary of the Interior had no controlling authority to redress  the \nplaintiffs’ injuries.  Id. at 568–69. \nIn  this  case, Plaintiffs fail to satisfy the “redressability” requirement of the case or \ncontroversy analysis.  Paul Rainwater as Executive Director of the LRA has no power to redress \n  9 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 39    Filed 07/08/09   Page 19 of 51\n \nthe asserted claims of Plaintiffs, just like the Secretary of the Interior had no authority to redress \nthe Lujan plaintiffs’ claims.  Id. at 568-69.  In fact, under Louisiana law, only the L RA has the \nauthority to revise the grant formula and recalculate grants, the requested relief by the plaintiffs \nin their Complaint.6  It is further clear that as Rainwater has no power to redress the injuries as \nalleged, Plaintiffs have no case or controversy with this defendant that will permit them to \nmaintain this action in federal court.   See Muskrat v. U.S. , 219 U.S. 346 (1911) ;   Simon v. E. \nKentucky Welfare Rig hts Org., 426 U.S. 26, 41 (1976) (denying standing to indigent plaintiffs \nwho alleged unfair hospital services but only sued Treasury officials who were not able to \nredress plaintiffs’ injuries); Miami Bldg. & Const . Trades Council v. Sec retary of Defense, 493 \nF.3d 201, 205 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (“[W]hether claims of economic  injury would be redressed by a \nfavorable decision depends on the unfettered choices made by independent actors not before the \ncourts and whose exercise of broad and legitimate discretion the courts cannot presume either to  \ncontrol or to predict.”).  \nRainwater cannot be ordered to act in any way that is beyond his authority to act in the \nfirst place.   \nWhen Congress passes an Act empowering administrative agencies \nto carry on governmental activities, the power of those agencies is \ncircumscribed by the authority granted.  This permits the courts to \nparticipate in law enforcement entrusted to administrative bodies \nonly to the extent necessary to protect justiciable individual rights \nagainst administrative action fairly beyond the granted powers. \n \nLujan, 504 U.S . at 577  (quoting Stark v. Wickard , 321 U.S. 288 , 309–10 (1944)).  Thus, it \nlogically follows that since the LRA proposed and developed the Road Home grant formula in \n                                                \n6   This begs the question of why Rainwater, and not the LRA, is a party to this suit.  See Ford Motor Co. v. Dept. of \nTreasury, 323 U.S. 459, 464 (1945) (holding that when the State is the real, substantial party in interest, the State is \nallowed to invoke sovereign immunity).  Here, Rainwater is not the real party in interest, andP laintiffs’ suit is \npurposefully crafted so as to avoid Eleventh Amendment immunity.  Rainwaterr equests that this Court follow the \nSupreme Court’s language in Edelman v. Jordan: “It is also well established that even though a State is not named a \nparty to the action, the suit may nonetheless be barred by the Eleventh Amendment.”  E  delman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. \n651, 663 (1974) (citing Ford, supra). \n  10 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 39    Filed 07/08/09   Page 20 of 51\n \nconsultation with HUD, those are the parties vested with power by Congress to “revise” the Road \nHome formula and “recalculate” the awards.   Lujan, 504 U.S. at 568–69.  Rainwater retains no \nsuch authority to act bey ond his granted powers to alter the formula.  Plaintiffs urge Rainwater \nnot only to act outside of the scope of his statutorily -granted authority but urge this Court to \noverstep the boundaries explicitly drawn by the Constitution —that Congress “define \ninjuries…that will give rise to a case or controversy” and the Judiciary interpret the \nCongressional language.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 580.7   \nIII.  Sovereign Interests Are Implicated In This Case Through Louisiana’s  \n  Road Home Program               \n \n  Rainwater contends that the  Ex Parte  Young doctrine does not extend to this case \nbecause regulation of Louisiana’s Road Home  program is as much a core sovereign interest o f \nLouisiana as regulating submerged land was for Idaho in Idaho v. Coeur d’Alene Tribe, 521 U.S. \n261 (1997).  In Coeur d’Alene Tribe, the Supreme Court held that  Ex Parte Young doctrine did \nnot authorize injunctive relief against state officials that would “diminish, even extinguish, the \nState’s control over a vast reach of lands and waters long deemed by the state to be an integral \npart of its territory.”  Id. at 282. \n  In Coeur d’Alene Tribe, the Supreme Court reasoned that proper application of the  Ex \nParte Young doctrine requires a case by case analysis that carefully considers whether a state \nforum is available to vindicate the federal int erests, the nature of the federal rights to be \nvindicated, and the competing sovereignty interests of the state.   Id. at 270-80.  Specifically, the \nCourt “noted that even prospective relief…would be barred if the relief sought is the functional \n                                                \n7   As the Supreme Court comments in Lujan, “[W]e must be sensitive to the articulation of new rights of action that \ndo not have clear analogs in our common-law tradition.  In exercising [its] power, however, Congress must at the \nvery least identify the injury it seeks to vindicate and relate the injury to the class of persons entitled to bring suit.” \nLujan, 504 U.S. at 590.  In our case, allowing Plaintiffs’ suit to proceed would create a new right of action, pursuant \nto the FHA and the HCDA, to sue a state official with no authority to redress the alleged injuries . See Wright v. \nAllen, 468 U.S. 737, 752 (1984) (noting that adjudication of claim was proper only when consistent with separation \nof powers doctrine). \n  11 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 39    Filed 07/08/09   Page 21 of 51\n \nequivalent of relief otherwise barred by the Eleventh Amendment and ‘special sovereignty \ninterests’ are implicated.” Barton v. Summers, 293 F.3d 944, 951  (6th Cir. 2002) (citing Couer \nd’Alene Tribe, 521 U.S. at 281).  \nThis case does present a special sovereign interest that requires dismissal based upon \nEleventh Amendment immunity.  Although it involves the use of federal funds, this case, at its \ncore, concerns a state-designed disaster recovery program implicating an important state interest. \nCreated in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita \nin 2005, the Louisiana Recovery Authority (LRA) is the \ncoordinating and planning body leading the most extensive \nrebuilding effort  in American history.    The central point for \nhurricane recovery in Louisiana, the LRA works closely with the \nGovernor’s office, Homeland Security and Emergency \nPreparedness Program (GOHSEP) and partners with state and \nfederal agencies to oversee more than $20 billion worth of \nprograms, speed the pace of rebuilding , remove hurdles and red \ntape and insures that Louisiana recovers safer and stronger than \nbefore.  \n \nSee http://www.lra.louisiana.gov.  \n \nIt is also significant that, in  Coeur d’Alene Tribe , Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice \nKennedy “called for a ‘fundamental reconceptualization’ of  Ex Parte Young .” Wright, Mi ller, \nCooper & Amar,  FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE, Jurisdiction and Related Matters , 17A \nFPP § 4232 (2009) . These two justices “would have limited the  Young ‘exception’ to Eleventh \nAmendment cases in which no state forum was available to decide whethe r federal laws entitled \na plaintiff to injunctive relief.” Id. (citing Couer D’Alene Tribe, 521 U.S. at 270-80 (Kennedy, J., \njoined by Rehnquist, C.J.)).8 \n                                                \n8   Rainwater recognizes that seven justices refused to join this portion of the opinion.  AlthoughV  erizon Maryland \nv. Public Service Commission of Maryland, 535 U.S. 635 (2002), controls this issue, commentators have noted the \n“newly developing effect of Coeur d’Alene Tribe.”   Hill v. Kemp, 478 F.3d 1236, 1257 n. 25 (10th Cir. 2007). \n  12 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 39    Filed 07/08/09   Page 22 of 51\n \n  Although this lawsuit does not involve state land ,9 the sovereign interests of the State of \nLouisiana are implicated through t he disaster recovery  program known as T he Road Home \nprogram.10  It is in Louisiana’s sovereign interests that its  residents be able to return to their \nhomes as quickly as possible  and through the mechanisms designed by the state’s Road Home \nprogram.  The Road Home program  is certainly a sovereign interest of the State of Louisiana. \nPlaintiffs’ suit implicates Louisiana’s interest in administering the funds it was granted to aid of \nits residents.  See Couer D’Alene Tribe, 521 U.S. at 282 (“Any contention that the State is not \nimplicated by the suit in a manner having an immediate effect on jurisdictional control over \nimportant public lands is belied by the complaint itself.”).   If allowed to proceed, this action will \nsignificantly affect Louisiana’s ability to rebuild its communities. Id.    \nIV.  Louisiana Has Not Waived Its Sovereign Immunity Through Its Receipt  \n  Of Federal Funds Or Participation In A Federal Program     \n \n  The U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly held that waiver of a state’s sovereign immunity  \nrequires an explicit, emphatic statement.  That is, a state waives its immunity from suit in federal \ncourt only where that waiver is “stated by the most express language or by such overwhelming \nimplications from text as will leave no room for any reasonab le construction.”  Edelman v. \nJordan, 415 U.S. 651, 653  (1974).  The purpose of this “stringent” test is to “to be certain that \nthe state in fact c onsents to suit.”   College Savings Bank v. Florida Pre -Paid Post Secondary \nEducation Expense Board, 527 U.S. 666, 675, 680  (1999).  Thus, we will not find “consent by \nimplication or by use of ambiguous language.”  Library of Congress v. Shaw, 478 U.S. 310, 318 \n(1986).   \n                                                \n9   Although not at issue in this lawsuit, under Option 3 of the Road Home program, Louisiana homeowners can \nelect to sell their homes to the state of Louisiana. http://www.road2la.org/homeowner/overview.htm.  In this way, \nthe Road Home program does involve state ownership of land, although Plaintiffs in this case did not exercise option \n3.  The State of Louisiana owns a substantial amount of property through Option 3 of The Road Home program.   \n10  See e.g., Cardenas v. Anza, 311 F. 3d. 929, 941 (9th Cir. 2002) (O’Scanlain concurring) (“would hold plaintiff’s \nclaims to be barred under the Coeur d’Alene exception to Ex Parte Young.”).  \n  13 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 39    Filed 07/08/09   Page 23 of 51\n \n  “A state does not waive its sovereign immunity through its mere receipt of federal funds \nor participation in a federal program.”  Atasendero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 246–\n47 (1985).  Instead, Congress must also express “a clear intent to condition participation . . . on a \nstate’s consent to waive its constitutional immunity.”   Id. at 247;  Litman vs. George Mason \nUniversity, 186 F.3d 544, 554 (4th Cir. 1999)  (recognizing Congress must “codify a clear, \nunambiguous and an unequivocal condition of waiver.”)  \n  Further, HUD’s contention that 42 U.S.C.   §  2000d-7(1) operates as a waiver of \nLouisiana’s, and presumably Rainwater’s, sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment \nis misguided.  As HUD asserts, 42 U.S.C.  § 2000(d)-7(1) provides that a State is not immune \nfrom suits in federal court involving violations of  “Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or \nthe provisions of any other Federal statute prohibiting discrimination by recipients of Federal \nfinancial assistance.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-7(1).  \nPlaintiffs have not sued Rainwater under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. \nPlaintiffs have asserted claims under Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968,  42 U.S.C. §§ \n3604, 3605, and 3608 (the “Fair Housing Act” or “FHA”), and the Housing and Community \nDevelopment Act of 1974, 42 U.S.C. § 5304  (the “HCDA”).  (Complaint, Dkt. 1, ¶¶ 74 -77; \nPlaintiffs’ Opposition, Dkt. 34, p. 1.)  Thus, Louisiana could not have waived its immunity on \nthis basis because Plaintiffs’ have not alleged a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of \n1964.  \n  It should also be noted that the cases on which HUD relies for the proposition that the \nSupreme Court has agreed that the receipt of Federal  funds operates as a waiver of Eleventh \nAmendment immunity both involved claims under the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C.  § 794, see \nLane v. Pe ňa, 518 U.S. 187 (1986) , as did the case to which  Lane was a response,  See \n  14 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 39    Filed 07/08/09   Page 24 of 51\n \nAtascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234 (1985). 42 U.S.C.  § 2000d-7(1) expressly \nlists the Rehabilitation Act as a statute under which a state waives its Eleventh Amendm ent \nimmunity by the receipt of federal funds, but it does not list either the FHA or the HCDA. \n  In the instant case, this Court should reject HUD’s flawed argument as neither the State \nof Louisiana nor Rainwater has consented to the jurisdiction of this Co urt for these claims by \nPlaintiffs through the receipt of federal funds in the Road Home program.11 \nV.  “Revise” and “Recalculate” Equals Retrospective Relief \n  Through a tortured  and disingenuous analysis,  P laintiffs conclude their request for \ninjunctive relief to “revise” the grant formula and “recalculate” grants “falls comfortably on the \nprospective side of [the damages] line.”  ( Plaintiffs’ Opposition, Dkt. 34, p. 23.)  However, any \nclaim for retroactive monetary relief, under any name, is barred.  United States v. Yonkers Bd. Of \nEduc., 893 F.2d 498, 503 ( 2d Cir. 1990); County of Oneida v. Oneida India n Nation, 470 U.S. \n226, 251–52 (1985). \n  “In determining whether the doctrine of  Ex Parte Young avoids an Eleventh Amendment \nbar to suit, a court need only conduct a ‘straight forward inquiry into whether [the] complaint \nalleges an ongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly cha racterized as \nprospective.’”  Idaho v. Coeur d’Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U.S. 261, 296 (1997).  \nHere Plaintiffs seek declaratory relief to  revise an alleged discriminatory grant formula.  \nThe primary objective of  Plaintiffs’  suit is to recalculate their respective Road Home \ncompensation  grants through a revision of the grant formula.   Plaintiffs principally, and \n                                                \n11   The fact that the LRA explicitly agreed to obey federal law in administering the program can hardly been \ndeemed as an express waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity.  This agreement merely stated a customary \ncondition for any participation in a federal program by the state, and Edelman already established that neither such \nparticipation in itself, nor a commitment to obey federal law, is sufficient to waive the protection of the Eleventh \nAmendment.  See Florida Dept. of Health and Rehabilitative Services v. Florida Nursing Home Assoc., 450 U.S. \n147, 150  (1981)(citing Edelman, 415 U.S. at 673-674).  \n  15 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 39    Filed 07/08/09   Page 25 of 51\n \nincorrectly, rely on  Bowen v.  Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879 (1988),  for the contention that the \ndamages they seek here are not “money damages,” but instead specific injunctive and declaratory \nrelief. (Plaintiffs’ Opposition, Dkt. 34, pp. 17-18.)  Bowen is distinguishable because it dealt with \nMedicaid reimbursements to which the State was already  entitled, quite unlike the CDBG funds \nin this case which have already been appropriated.  In  this case, the relief sought is not  a \nreimbursement already owed to  Plaintiffs but additional money to which they are not entitled. 12   \nSee Bowen, 487 U.S. at 892 -93; Green v. Mansour , 474 U.S. 64 , 73 (1985)(“[I]ssuance of a \ndeclaratory judgment in these circumstances would have much the same effect as a full -fledged \naward of damages or res titution by the federal court, the latter kinds of relief of course being \nprohibited by the Eleventh Amendment.”);  Barton v. Summers , 293 F.3d 944, 950 (6th Cir. \n2002) (“A court may enter a pr ospective injunction that costs the state money, but only if the \nmonetary impact is ancillary , i.e., not the primary purpose of the suit.”).  Rainwater maintains \nthat the relief requested by  Plaintiffs is entirely retrospective rather than prospective beca use \nrevisions and recalculations of  The Road Home formula will inevitably lead to a retrospective \nmonetary award to Plaintiffs. \n  This case is analogous to the facts in  Florida Assoc. of Rehabilitative Facilities, Inc. v. \nState of Florida Dept. of Health an d Rehabilitative Servs., 225 F. 3d 1208 (11th Cir. 2000) .  In \nthat case, various operators of intermediate care facilities in Florida for developmentally disabled \n(ICF/DD) filed a Section 1983 action aga inst the Florida Department of Health and \nRehabilitation Services and state officials seeking injunctive and declaratory relief for alleged \nviolations of Medicaid’s reimbursement provisions.  The Eleventh Circuit reversed the district \n                                                \n12   Bowen is additionally distinguishable because in Bowen the plaintiffs sued the Department of Health and Human \nServices, a party which could adequately redress the plaintiff’s complaint for specific relief.  Here, Plaintiffs have \nsued Rainwater, who has no authority to “revise” the Road Home formula and “recalculate” the previously allocated \ngrants. \n  16 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 39    Filed 07/08/09   Page 26 of 51\n \ncourt’s judgment and  found that “it essentially required them to redress inequities in their past \nreimbursement payments from 1991 to date of final judgment (April 1999), and potentially to \nreimburse plaintiffs for those past deficiencies.  The Eleventh Circuit found that ther e was “no \nway to distinguish the holding of  Edelman which prohibits exactly this sort retroactive award.”  \nId. at 1219.  Thus, this Cou rt should not be misled by the P laintiffs as they seek to circumvent \nthe Edelman holding when the claims they actually se ek are retrospective by the plain language \nof their complaint. \nVI.   Plaintiffs Fail to State a Claim under the Fair Housing Act \nA.   The Federal Appropriations Acts Do Not Restrict the Use of CDBG  \n  funds to Housing Programs. \n \nPlaintiffs suggest that the Fe deral Appropriations Acts contain provisions limiting the \nspending of the CDBG funds to housing-related activities which fall under the Fair Housing Act \n(FHA) and/or the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974  (HCDA).  In fact, the \nFederal Appropriations Acts are clear that the CDBG funds can be used by the state for a variety \nof disaster recovery-related uses, and are specifically not restricted to housing or housing -related \nprograms: \nFor an additional amount for the ‘Community development fund’, \nfor necessary expenses related to disaster relief, long -term \nrecovery, and restoration of infrastructure in the most impacted and \ndistressed areas related to the consequences of hurricanes in the \nGulf of Mexico in 2005 in States for which the President declar ed \na major disaster under title IV of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster \nRelief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.) in \nconjunction with Hurricane Katrina, Rita, or Wilma, . . .. \n \n(See Pubic Laws 109 -148 and 109 -234, Dkt. 34-4.)  In other wor ds, the CD BG funds are \navailable for various disaster recovery activities.  According to the Federal Appropriations Acts, \nLouisiana was not required to develop or implement any “housing programs” for homeowners to \n  17 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 39    Filed 07/08/09   Page 27 of 51\n \ngoverned by the FHA.  To the contrary, Lou isiana was given the freedom and flexibility to \ndesign and implement whatever programs it chose to distribute the CDBG funds.  ( Kome \nDeclaration, Dkt. 22-2, ¶¶ 2, 9, 13, 16, 18, 23, 24.)   Indeed, HUD’s requirement was that \nLouisiana certify that activities funded “be for necessary expenses related to disaster relief, long-\nterm recovery, and restoration of infrastructure in the most impacted and distressed areas related \nto the consequences of the hurricane;” HUD did not require Louisiana to use the CDBG funds on \nhousing programs or programs which would fall under the FHA.  See 71 Fed. Reg. 7666, 7670 \n(Feb. 13, 2006); (Kome Declaration, Dkt. 22-2, ¶ 13.) \nB.  The State of Louisiana’s Certifications Do Not Amount to a Consent  \n  that the Fair Housing Act Applies to the Compensation Grants.  \n \nPlaintiffs also argue the FHA provide them with a claim in this case because Paul \nRainwater certified he would comply with the FHA in connection the State’s application and \ncontract to receive CDGB funds.  First, Paul Rainwater personally did not sign any certifications \nto receive the CDBG funds at issue in this case; the certifications were signed by Jean S. Vandal, \nthe Deputy Commissioner of Louisiana, Division of Administration. (Certifications, Exhibit D.)   \nNevertheless, in  t hese certifications, the State agreed to comply with various laws, \nincluding Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, 42 USC  § 5301, \nSection 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, 12 U.S.C.  § 1701u, Title VI of \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.  § 2000d and the FHA, 42 U.S.C.  § 3601-3619.  Indeed, \nsome, but not all, of LRA’s programs funded by CDBG money would arguably fall within the \nambit of the FHA.  For instance, Louisiana has used CDBG fu nds for operating subsidies for \naffordable rental housing and rental and utility payment expenses. (Kome Declaration, Dkt. 22-2, \n¶¶ 24, 25.)  In addition, the LRA established a First -Time Homeowners Program, a government \nsubsidized mortgage program for low to moderate income, first -time homebuyers located in the \n  18 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 39    Filed 07/08/09   Page 28 of 51\n \n13 storm-impacted parishes; the First Time Homebuyers Program provides mortgage financing, \nfunds for down payments, closing costs, and construction costs to eligible homebuyers. (See \nwww.lra.louisiana.gov.)  Likewise, the LRA also administers Rental Programs, which, in some \ncases, provide loans and financing to property owners who operate or agree to build affordable \nrental property.  These programs may f all under the purview of the FHA because they are \ndirectly related to housing.   \nTherefore, some, but not all, of LRA’s programs are governed by the FHA.  Obviously, \nthe State’s certifications apply to the LRA programs which provide housing and are subject  to \nthe FHA.  However, the program at issue in this case (The Road Home Option 1) does not \nprovide housing.   This program specifically does not involve the sale or rental of housing.  \nInstead, this program awards compensation grants to homeowners based on  eligibility criteria; \nthe amount of the grant awards are dependant on various values, which take into account home \nvalues. (Kome Declaration, Dkt. 22-2, ¶¶ 16-20.) \n Importantly, despite Plaintiff’s erroneous description of the compensation grant program, \nthe compensation grants are not restricted in their use to rebuilding or repairing housing. 13 \n(Exhibit A, Dkt. 28-3, § 2.1, p. 5.)  Instead, applicants have “complete discretion” as to the use of \nthe funds, meaning they are able to use the compensation grant  money as they choose, and are \nnot required to use the grant money for housing and/or rebuilding costs. (Exhibit A,  Dkt 28-3, § \n2.1, p. 5.)   In other words, contrary to Plaintiff’s unsupported allegations contained in the \nComplaint and opposition  brief, homeowners who receive Road Home compensation grant do \n                                                \n13   This Court need not accept inferences drawn by Plaintiffs if unsupported by the facts. Kowal v. MCI \nCommunications Corp., 16 F.3d 1271, 1276 (D.C. Cir. 1994).  In addition, this Court can consider facts contained in \ndocuments incorporated in Plaintiffs’ complaint, matters in which the Court has taken judicial notice, and matters of \npublic record.  EEOC v. St. Francis Xavier Parochial Sch., 117 F.3d 621, 624 (D.C. Cir. 1997); Marshall County \nHealth Care Auth. V. Shalala, 988 F.2d 1221, 1226 n.6 (D.C. Cir. 1993). \n  19 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 39    Filed 07/08/09   Page 29 of 51\n \nnot have to agree to use the grant money to rebuild or repair their homes. (Exhibit A,  Dkt. 28-3, \n§ 2.1, p. 5.)   \nC.  There is No Jurisprudence Which Dictates That The Fair Housing  \n  Act Applies to this Case. \n \nFirst, the Plaintiffs have not cited any jurisprudence holding a state officers’ certification \ncontained in either an application for federal assistance or grant approval/ agreement is \ntantamount to a waiver of jurisdiction under any federal statute , including the FHA.  Indeed, no \nsuch case exists.  Simply put, the state’s certification that it will comply with various laws is in \nno way an admission or consent that the laws actually apply or that a plaintiff can state a viable \nclaim under the law14.  Cf. Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 673 (1974)  (rejecting the concept \nthat Illinois “constructively consented” to suit by agreeing to administer federal funds in \ncompliance with federal law). \nIn addit ion, neither Plaintiffs nor HUD has cited any jurisprudence holding that a \ncompensation program like the one developed, established and run by the LRA, is subject to the \nprovisions of the FHA.  Indeed, as previously stated, in Rainwater’s Memorandum in Support of \nthe Motion to Dismiss this is an issue of first impression.    \nThe FHA forbids racial discrimination in respect to the sale or rental of a dwelling. 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 3604, 3605; Meyer v. Holley, 537 U.S. 280, 281 (2003).  While the FHA is interpreted \nbroadly, the statute is not limitless and does not pertain to any and every program merely \nbecause HUD is the appointed as the federal agency with oversight.  In fact, as the court in  \nGourlay v. Forest Lake Estates Civic Association , 27 6 F.Supp.   2d 1222, 1232 (M.D.  Fla. \n                                                \n14   In fact, at the time Louisiana signed the CDBG application and agreement, it was considering a housing \nrehabilitation and reconstruction program. (Kome Declaration, Dkt. 22-2, ¶ 16.) However, Louisiana opted not to \nestablish a housing program, but instead to develop a homeowners compensation program. (Kome Declaration Dkt. \n22-2, ¶ 16.) \n  20 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 39    Filed 07/08/09   Page 30 of 51\n \n2003)15, noted, “. . . the FHA was passed to e nsure fairness and equality in housing . . . , not to \nbecome some all purpose civility code . . ..”   Further, the FHA should not be allowed to become \n“an all purpose cause of action, especially “when the dispute has little or no actual relation to \nhousing discrimination.” Id. at 1236. Likewise, the Seventh Circuit in deciding  Halprin v. \nPrairie Single Family Homes, 388 F.3d 327 (7th Cir. 2004), discussed the legislative history of \nthe FHA and found it was geared at preventing discrimination in the context of sale or \nacquisition of housing only, and Congress never intended for it to become a catch all a nti-\ndiscrimination law; the Court stated, “[W]e do not think that Congress wanted to covert every \nquarrel . . .. into a federal case.”  Id. at 330. \n  1.  Plaintiff’s Claims Under § 3604(a) \nPlaintiffs sued under § 3604(a) of the FHA, and Plaintiffs and HUD argue that The Road \nHome program Option 1 formula “otherwise make[s] unavailable or den[ies], a dwelling to any \nperson because of race . . ..” 42 U.S.C. § 3604 (a).  Specifically, Plaintiffs and HUD argue the \nfunding formula as applied to African American homeowners in Orleans Parish does not provide \nsufficient funds to rebuild their homes; Plaintiffs and HUD are requesting this Court to construe \nthe phrase “otherwise make unavailable” contained in § 3604(a) broadly to fit their factual \nscenario. (Complaint, Dkt. 1, ¶ 4.)   \nHowever, courts have uniformly concluded the “otherwise make unavailable” language \nin § 3604(a) only prohibits discriminatory cond uct that directly impacts a plaintiff’s ability to \nlocate in an area and/or secure housing.  See Gourlay, 276 F.Supp. 2d at 1230 (holding §3604(a) \napplies only when a prohibited act makes a dwelling inaccessible for purchase, sale or rent); \nClifton Terrace Assoc., Ltd. v. United Technologies Corp. , 929 F.2d 714, 719 (D.C. Cir. 1991)  \n                                                \n15   After the Gourlay decision was published, it was withdrawn as a condition of settlement. See Gourlay v. Forest \nLake States Civil Ass’n, 2003 WL 22149660 (M.D. Fla. September 16, 2003). \n  21 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 39    Filed 07/08/09   Page 31 of 51\n \n(holding the FHA addresses problems of housing availability  and  not problems of housing \nhabitability); Southend Neighborhood Improvement Assoc. v. St. Clair County , 743 F.2d 1207, \n1210 (7th Cir. 1984)  (holding the FHA does not protect “intangible interests in . . . already \nowned property.”).  As the court in Gourlay noted, HUD’s regulations support this interpretation. \nHUD’s regulations interpreting § 3604(a) inclu de a list of examples of prohibited conduct. 24 \nC.F.R. § 100.70(c)-(d).   While the list is not exhaustive, none of the prohibited activities listed \nin the regulation deals with a pro tected persons use or enjoyment of a dwelling  after purchase. \n24 C.F.R. § 100.70(c)-(d).    \nTo be sure, Rainwater and the LRA have not made any dwelling “unavailable” for sale or \nrental in violation of § 3604(a).  Inste ad, to be eligible for The Road Home program, applicants \nhad to be homeowners within the thirty -seven (37) parish region at the time of Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita.  In other words, it is stipulated the Plaintiffs all owned homes at the time of the \nhurricanes. (Complaint, Dkt. 1,  ¶¶ 13-17, 21.)   \nPlaintiffs argue Rainwater made their homes “unavailable,” because, without funding \nfrom The Road Home program, they are unable to complete renovations to their home. \n(Complaint, Dkt. 1, ¶¶ 61-65.)  However, Plaintiffs’ home renovations affect the habitability not \navailability to purchase their homes, and, thus this Circuit’s holding in Clifton Terrace is directly \non point.  Clifton Terrace, 929 F.2d at 719 (holding no § 3604 violation in refusing to repair \nelevator as the FHA addresses problems of housing availability and not problems of housing \nhabitability).   In other words, completing renovations would make Plaintiff’s homes more \nhabitable; but home renovations do not affect the Plaintiffs ability to become homeo wners in the \nfirst place as they already owned  their homes (and had to own their homes to meet eligibility \nrequirements for the program).   \n  22 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 39    Filed 07/08/09   Page 32 of 51\n \nPlaintiffs’ Complaint demonstrates that their FHA claim is based on habitability instead \nof access to buy or rent a  home. (Complaint, Dkt. 1,  ¶¶ 61- 65.)  For instance, Plaintiff Daphne \nJones alleges because of application of The Road Home Option 1 formula, she “has not been \nable to complete all needed repairs to her home, and has had to utilize personal savings and \nvolunteer labor to make the home livable.” (Complaint,  Dkt. 1, ¶ 64.)  Plaintiff Jones’ home is \n“livable,” but more CDBG funds would presumably have made her home nicer.   (Complaint, \nDkt. 1, ¶ 64.)   Likewise, Plaintiff Rhonda Dents “is living in a modular ho me of poorer \nconstruction quality and smaller size on the same property.” (Complaint,  Dkt. 1, ¶ 62.)  Again, \nthe LRA has not prevented Plaintiff Jones from owning a home; her complaint instead goes to \nthe habitability, i.e., with more CDBG funds she could  have owned a larger home made with \nbetter construction materials.  Finally, in their opposition brief, Plaintiffs argue that the FHA \napplies when conduct places a plaintiff “at risk of losing their property.”  However, there are no \nallegations in the Compl aint that any of the Plaintiffs are at risk of losing their properties.  \nIndeed, Plaintiffs in this case are not at risk of losing their property, and certainly are not at risk \nof losing property because of any action of Rainwater and/or the LRA. Therefore , Plaintiffs \nreliance on that jurisprudence is misplaced and unconvincing. \n  23 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 39    Filed 07/08/09   Page 33 of 51\n \n  2.  Plaintiff’s Claims Under § 3605(a)  \nPlaintiffs also sued under § 3605(a) of the FHA, which provides that it is unlawful for \nany person or entity whose business includes engagi ng in residential real estate -related \ntransactions to discriminate against any person in making available such a transaction, or in the \nterms or conditions of such a transaction, because of race.   Again, Plaintiffs ask this Court to \nread the FHA too broadly as they argue Rainwater and/or HUD violated § 3605(a) by providing \n“financial assistance for purchasing, constructing, improving, repairing, or maintaining a \ndwelling.”  However, neither Rainwater or the LRA were engaged in any real estate transactions \nwith Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs have failed to allege that Rainwater engaged in any real estate \ntransactions with Plaintiffs in the Complaint.   \nThis Court’s prior rulings interpreting § 3605(a) make it clear that The Road Home \ncompensation grants do not fal l within the purview of § 3605(a).  Indeed, in  National Fair \nHousing Alliance, Inc. v. Prudential Insurance Company of America, 208 F.Supp. 2d 46 (D.D.C. \n2002), this Court held the practice of redlining homeowners insurance products constituted \n“other financial assistance” under §3605(a).  However, in doing so, this Court noted homeowners \nare typically required to have homeowners’ insurance coverage in order to qualify for a mortgage \nor home equity loan, and must maintain insurance as a condition of the loan.  Prudential, 208 \nF.Supp.2d at 49.  Notably, this Court stated: \nIt is undisputed that individuals are often unable to purchase or to \nmaintain financing for homes without homeowners insurance.  \nWithout property insurance, most homeowners are unable to repair \ntheir homes when and if disaster should strike.  For these reasons, \ninsurance provides the financial assistance necessary to maintain a \ndwelling.  As such, it is reasonable to conclude the Congress \nintended that homeowners insurance fall within the scope of \n3605’s protection. \n \nPrudential, 208 F.Supp. 2d at 58.   \n  24 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 39    Filed 07/08/09   Page 34 of 51\n \nUnlike in the Prudential case, in this case, compensation grants awarded by the LRA to \neligible homeowners are not a condition or pre -requisite to obtaining a home loan and, by \nextension, a home.  The Road Home compensation grants are in no way tied to the financing of a \ndwelling, and the funds are not restricted or required to be used for the purchasing, constructing, \nimproving, repairing or maintaining of a dwelling. Again, the eligible recipients of the g rants \nwere already homeowners and The Road Home funds can be used by the homeowners in any \nway they please with no accounting, documentation, oversight or certification required by the \nLRA or HUD. The compensation grant funds are not an entitlement, and, i nstead are considered \na one-time benefit to homeowners affected by Hurricanes Katrina and/or Rita. (Exhibit A,  Dkt. \n28-3, § 2.4.1, p. 8.) \n        3.  Plaintiff’s Claims Under §3608(d)(5) \nFinally, in their opposition brief, Plaintiffs clarified that they are asserting a claim against \nRainwater under § 3608(d)(5) of the FHA.  Plaintiffs argue § 3608(d)(5) applies to “state \ngrantees” under “three decades of case law.”  (Plaintiffs’ Opposition, Dkt. 34, p. 29.) However, \nthere is not one case from this district h olding the provisions of § 3608 apply to a state agency \nand/or the executive director of a state agency.  By its terms and a plain reading of the statute, § \n3608(d) applies  only  to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and executive \ndepartments and Federal agencies.  Further, this Court has previously ruled that a plaintiff does \nnot have an implied private right of action to enforce the provisions of § 3608(d).  Jones v. Office \nof the Comptroller of the Currency , 983 F.Supp. 197 (D.D.C. 1997) , aff’d, 1998 WL 315581 \n(D.C. Cir. May 12, 1998).  Therefore, Plaintiffs claim against Rainwater under this provision of \nthe FHA is not cognizable.  \n  25 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 39    Filed 07/08/09   Page 35 of 51\n \nVII.   Plaintiffs Cannot Maintain a Claim Against Rainwater Under  \n  the Housing and Community Development Act       \n \n  Plaintiffs assert they have a private right of action to enforce § 5304(b)(2) of the Housing \nand Community Development Act (HCDA).  In support of their argument, Plaintiffs allege there \nis express legislative intent indicating Congress intended private citizens to pursue claims \nindividually under the HCDA. (Plaintiffs’ Oppo sition, Dkt. 34, p. 31 .)  In order to establish \nCongressional intent, Plaintiffs rely on a 1987 House Report.   Further, Plaintiffs rely on the case \nof Montgomery Improvement Association, Inc. v. HUD, 645 F.2d 291 (5th Cir. 1981).  However, \nneither the House Report or the Montgomery case are persuasive.   \nFirst, in an attempt to establish Congressional intent, Plaintiffs cite a House Report to the \n1987 amendments to the HCDA.  However, Plaintiffs citation is misleading, to say the least.  The \nquotation offered by Plaintiffs relates to a portion of the bill pertaining to rental assistan ce \npayments made pursuant to the National Housing Act, 12 U.S.C.  § 1701, et seq., and rent \nsupplemental payments pursuant to the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965, 12 U.S.C. \n§ 1701s, et seq.   In other words, the provision cited by Plaintiffs do not relate to the HCDA.  \nInstead, the provision cited by the Plaintiffs support a private right of action for the beneficiaries \nof rent subsidies under the National Housing Act and Housing and Urban Development Act.  The \ncomplete quotation clarifies this: \nThe Committee bill provides for full funding for state financed \nSec. 236 projects of additional rental assistance payments (RAP), \nmade pursuant to Sec. 236(f)(2) of the National Housing Act, and \nof rent supp lemental payments, made pursuant to Sec. 101(a) of \nthe Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965, when tenant \nrent payments plus existing assistance payments are insufficient to \ncover the total rent of units occupied by low-income tenants.  State \nprojects would thus be treated in the same manner as federally \ninsured projects which under present law receive 100% funding of \nthe shortfall. The Committee believes that not only is the present \nlaw which limits state projects to 90% funding of the rent shortfall \n  26 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 39    Filed 07/08/09   Page 36 of 51\n \ninequitable, but the absence of full funding limits the ability of \nthose projects to accommodate the entire spectrum of low -income \ntenants.   \n \nThe provisions of this bill are intended to benefit applicants and \ntenants.   The assisted housing programs have be en created \nspecifically to assure lower income households have greater access \nto decent and affordable housing than their limited incomes would \notherwise permit. The Committee intents, and has always intended, \nthat applicants and tenants who are adversely  affected by \nviolations of these statutory provisions should have a cause of \naction to enforce the statute in federal court.   In the past, such \ncauses of action were not explicitly specified in the statute because \nprogram beneficiaries were thought to be  a ble to protect their \ninterest under the Administrative  Procedure Act, Sec. 1983, and \nthe implied cause of action doctrine.  Because the courts have been \nsomewhat unreceptive to private causes of action, the Committee \nwishes to clarify its long -standing intention in favor of private \nenforcement.  This clarification is not intended to weaken any \nrights of program beneficiaries or the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development to enforce statutes previously or in the future.  \n \nH.R. Rep. No. 100-122(I), at 52–53 (1987), as reprinted in 1987 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3317, 3368–69.  \nPlaintiffs are mistaken and disingenuous in suggesting that this provision stands for the \nproposition that Congress intended citizens to have a private right of action for enforcement of \nthe HCDA.  This provision of the House Report does not stand for that proposition at all, and, in \nfact, there is no published Congressional intent for a private right of action to enforce the HCDA.   \n  Plaintiffs also rely on the Fifth Circuit Montgomery case.  First, the Montgomery case has \nnot been adopted by this Circuit and appears to be an abrogation.  See Latinos Unidos de Chelsea \nv. Secretary of Housing, 799 F.2d 774, 795 (1st Cir. 1986) (“Congress did not intend to create a \nprivate right of action  under the HCDA.”);  Dotson v. Pacific Gas and Electric Co. , 1993 WL \n248644 (N.D. Cal. June 25. 1993), aff’d, 46 F.3d 1140 (9th Cir. 1995); Milsap v. HUD, 1990 WL \n157516 (D. Minn. October 18, 1990) , aff’d, 42 F.3d 1394 (8 th Cir. 1994), Pleune v. Pierce, 697 \nF.Supp. 113, 119 (E.D.N.Y. 1988); Nabke v. HUD, 520 F.Supp. 5 (W.D. Mich. 1981); People’s \n  27 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 39    Filed 07/08/09   Page 37 of 51\n \nHousing Development Corp. v. City of Poukepsie , 425 F.Supp. 482, 491 (S.D.N.Y. 1976) .  \nFurther, while this Circuit has never directly ruled on whether the HCDA provides a private \ncause of action, it has considered whether other federal statutes provi de a private cause of action \nand held plaintiffs did not have a cause of action to enforce federal funds recipients’ compliance \nwith proscriptions against discrimination.  See Women’s Equity Action League v. Cavazos , 906 \nF.2d 742 (D.C. Cir. 1990).   \nAdditionally, the Montgomery court relied on cases that have been effectively overruled, \nor if not technically overruled, at least are no longer precedent.  Specifically, the  Montgomery \ncourt relied heavily upon two Supreme Court cases,  Canon v. The University of Chicago , 441 \nU.S. 677 (1979) and Cort v. Ash, 422 U.S. 66 (1975), which are no longer good law.  In the same \nyear as the Canon decision, and after the  Canon decision was rendered, the Supreme Court \nissued its ruling in Touche Ross & Co. v. Redington , 442 U.S. 560 (1979).  In Touche Ross, the \nCourt adopted Justice Powell’s position as stated in his dissenting opinion in  Cannon; \nspecifically, in Touche Ross, the Court held federal courts will create a private right of action \nonly if there is affirmative evidence of Congress’ intent to create a private right of action.  In \nother words the four factor test of  Cort v. Ash no longer applies; although the Supreme Court in \nTouche Ross did not expressly discard  Cort v. Ash, it articulated an unmistakable departure in \nmethodology. Justice Scalia, joined by Justice O’Conner, also stated Touche Ross has effectively \noverruled Cort in  Thompson v. Thompson , 484 U.S. 174, 199 (1988) .  Therefore, because the \nMontgomery court relied on the Cort and Canon cases, its opinion now does not hold the weight \nof precedent. Therefore, under  Touche Ross, without affirmative evidence of Congressional \nintent to create a private right of action, there is no private right of action.  Simply put, there is \nno affirmative evidence, explicit or implied, that Congress intended to create a private right of \n  28 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 39    Filed 07/08/09   Page 38 of 51\n \naction for the enforcement of provision in the HCDA. No congressional intent to create a private \ncause of action “appear[s] implicitly in the language or structure of the statute, or in the \ncircumstances of its enactment.”  Thompson, 484 U.S. at 94.  Therefore, Plaintiffs should not be \nallowed to proceed with their claims against Rainwater under the HCDA. \nVIII.  Rainwater Has Met His Burden Under 28 U.S.C. 1404(a) \nA.  The Threshold Inquiry is Met \nThe threshold in quiry under 28 U.S.C.  §1404(a) is whether this case could have been \nbrought in Middle District of Louisiana.  Plaintiffs concede the Middle District of Louisiana is a \nproper venue for this action. HUD offers no evidence refuting the Middle District would b e a \nproper venue.  Notwithstanding, Rainwater has satisfied this threshold inquiry.   Rainwater and \nthe LRA reside and/or are domiciled in the Middle District and a substantial part of the events \ngiving rise to the Plaintiffs’ claims arose in the Middle Dis trict.  The LRA Action Plan, its \nchallenged formula and the Road Home program were all created and implemented in Baton \nRouge, Louisiana - within the Middle District.  The injuries Plaintiffs seek to redress took place \nin Louisiana and involve Louisiana re sidents.  Accordingly, pursuant to § 1404(a), Plaintiffs \ncould have brought their case in the Middle District of Louisiana.  \nB.  Venue Can be Considered Before Subject Matter Jurisdiction is Established \n  HUD's contention this court must first decide the iss ue of subject matter jurisdiction \nbefore transfer is incorrect.16   There are no fixed rules on when cases should be transferred. SEC \nv. Savoy Industries, Inc., 587 F.2d 1149, 1154 (D.C. Cir. 1978).  Instead, courts must adjudicate \nmotions to transfer on an individualized, case -by-case basis, giving due consideration to \n                                                \n16   Notably, Plaintiffs have not opposed this Court considering the matter of venue before subject matter \njurisdiction.  \n  29 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 39    Filed 07/08/09   Page 39 of 51\n \nconvenience and fairness.   Stewart Org., Inc.,  v. Ricoh Corp. , 487 U.S.  22, 27  (1988).  Such \nconsiderations warrant transfer of this case to the Middle District of Louisiana. \nIn Sinochem Int'l Co. Ltd. v. Malaysia Int'l Shipping Corp.,  549 U.S. 422  (2007), the \nSupreme Court held that a court can immediately take up the question of  forum non conveniens \nunder § 1404(a), and need not first consider whether it has subject matter or personal \njurisdiction. Courts in this District have adopted and applied  Sinochem’s rationale when \naddressing motions to transfer under § 1404(a).  \nIn Miller v. Toyota Motor Corporati on, 2009 WL 1531658 , at * 6 -8 (D.D.C. June 2, \n2009), the defendant filed a motion to di smiss on several grounds, including  forum non \nconveniens and lack of personal jurisdiction.  Relying on Sinochem, the court first considered the \ndefendant’s motion to dismiss on grounds of  forum non conveniens before deciding whether it \nhad personal or subject matter jurisdiction.   The court sua sponte transferred the case under §  \n1404(a) to the Middle District of Florida citing pri vate and public interest factors, including, the \nplaintiff’s home forum, higher costs of litigating the matter in District of Columbia, conservation \nof judicial resources; location of evidence and witnesses; existence of companion cases; and the \nDistrict of Columbia's lack of interest in the case.  \nSimilarly, in  Kazenercom TOO v. Turan Petroleum, Inc ., 590 F.Supp.2d 153 (D.D.C. \n2008), the defendants moved to dismiss the case on several grounds including FRCP 12(b)(1), \n(2), (3), (5) and (6), and alternatively, to transfer the case under §§ 1404(a), 1406(a) or 1631, and \nto strike certain allegations under Rule 12(f)(2).   Relying on  Sinochem, the court  immediately \ntook up the issue of  forum non conveniens before personal and subject matter jurisdiction, and \ntransferred the case under §  1404 to the Central District of California, citing several factors \nfavoring transfer, including  t he fact that plaintiffs (sellers) resided outside the District of \n  30 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 39    Filed 07/08/09   Page 40 of 51\n \nColumbia, the defendant’s (buyer) headquarters were located in California and locus of \nsignificant activities relating to the claims were in California.  \nIn Cheney v. IPD Analytics, LLC, 583 F.Supp. 2d 108 (D.D.C. 2008), defendants filed a \nmotion to dismiss the former employee’s action under ERISA fo r improper venue, or \nalternatively, to transfer the case.   Again, relying on Sinochem, the court noted its  discretion to \nresolve issues such as venue that do not affect the merits of the case without first deciding \npersonal jurisdiction.  The court held the interests of judicial economy and prudential concerns \nweighed in favor of resolving venue at the outset.   Even if it were to sort through the complex \npersonal jurisdictional issues raised by the defendants, the court would have had to address \ntransfer under § 1404(a) given the presence of a forum selection clause in the employee’s \nemployment agreement and the strong connection of the case to the state of Florida.   Although \nfinding the forum selection clause enforceable, the Court still addressed the balan cing factors \nunder § 1404(a).  Considering the totality of the circumstances the Court transferred the case to \nFlorida.  \nIn Focus Enterprises, Inc. v. Zassi Medical Evolutions, Inc., 2007 WL 1577844, * 1, fn. 1 \n(D.D.C. May 31, 2007), relying on  Sinochem, the court first considered the issue of venue and \ndid not reach the question of personal jurisdiction. The court observed “a federal court has \nleeway to choose among threshold grounds for  denying an audience to a case on the merits.” \nAfter considering the private and public interest factors, the court transferred the case to the \nMiddle District of Florida.  Although the plaintiff resided in the District of Columbia, most of the \nwitnesses were located in Florida.   \nUnder  Sinochem, this Court can consider venue  before subject matter jurisdiction.  \nAlthough HUD cites several cases in support of its position, none of the cases are in this district, \n  31 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 39    Filed 07/08/09   Page 41 of 51\n \nthe majority involve removal actions, 17 and all but one predates  Sinochem.  HUD ignores the \nbroad discretion given this Court by  Sinochem to consider venue before any other jur isdictional \nquestion.  \n  C.  HUD'S Position is Inconsistent \nIn seeking dismissal of Plaintiff's lawsuit, HUD claimed its involvement in the  Road \nHome program was “limited” to an advisory role and that the State of Louisiana bore “ultimate \nresponsibility” in  implementing, designing and administrating the  Road Home program .  \nSpecifically, HUD stated in pertinent part:  \n…HUD’s role is  confined (emphasis added) to ensuring that the state’s \ninterpretation of the statutory and regulatory requirements “are not plain ly \ninconsistent with the Act.” 24 C.F.R.§ 570.480(c)  (giving “maximum \nfeasible deference” to a state’s interpretation of these requirements)  \n \n…HUD’s  technical assistance  (emphasis added) typ ically involves \nconsultation with the grantee to determine the grantee’s objectives and its \nproposed program designs. HUD then provides advice, training, or \nprogram models that will ensure the grantee will be able to comply with \nCDBG program requirements  w hile carrying out its purposes an d \nimplementing its programs. \n \nHUD’s review of the applicant’s plan is limited... (emphasis added)  \n \n…The Road Home program is administered by the State of Louisiana \nthrough the Louisiana Office of Community Development and  the \nLouisiana Recovery Authority and is funded by HUD through the CDBG \nprogram. The State of Louisiana is responsible for the implementation, \n                                                \n17  DiPilato v.

Va. 2006)(holding  in a removal \naction, removal statute must be strictly construed for purposes of determining remand, remanded case for lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction. Lower court had already addressed motion to transfer but had not yet issued order when \nparty removed case to district court.) \n  32 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 39    Filed 07/08/09   Page 42 of 51\n \ndesign, and administration of the Road Home program in conformance \nwith the applicable CDBG program requirements set by HUD.  \n \n…In designing the Road Home homeowner compensation and incentives \nprogram, Louisiana requested, and HUD provided, some technical \nassistance…. HUD did not make  any of the state’s program decisions or \nset any funding strategies in the Road Home  Program. Most of HUD’s \ntechnical assistance was provided by telephone.  \n \nAs it developed the Road Home P rogram, Louisiana ultimately chose to \nprovide compensation and incentive grants to eligible homeowners \naffected by Hurricanes Rita or Katrina of up to  $ 150,000. Louisiana \ndecided to base the amount of the compensation and incentives grant on \nthe lower of the pre -storm, fair-market value of the home, or the cost to \nrepair the home. \n \n(Kome Declaration, Dkt. 22-2, ¶¶ 3, 8, 9, 15, 16, 18.)   \nNow, in opposing Rainwater’s Motion to Transfer, HUD claims this matter must remain \nin the District of Columbia because all of HUD’s challenged actions occurred here, including its \nconsultation, approval and “continuing oversight” of Louisiana’s  Road Home program . \nInterestingly, HUD concedes,  despite the presence of organizational plaintiff National Fair \nHousing Alliance in the District of Columbia,18 Plaintiffs' interest in this Court hearing their suit \nmay be diminished if HUD is no longer a party to the litigation. This is precisely the type of case   \nCameron v. Thornburgh,  983 F.2d 253 (D.C. Cir. 1993)  addressed. Plaintiffs' naming of \ngovernmental officials (such as HUD), solely to bring their suit in the District of Columbia, \nwhen the action should be pursued elsewhere (the Middle District of Louisiana), warrants \ntransfer of this case out of this District. \n                                                \n18  Plaintiffs and HUD cite the location of the National Fair Housing Alliance in the District of Columbia in \nopposing transfer. \n  33 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 39    Filed 07/08/09   Page 43 of 51\n \nD.  Private Interest and Public Interest Factors Favor Transfer \nof this Case to the Middle District of Louisiana. \n \n  1.  Private Interest Factors: Parties' Choice of Forum;  \n    Where the Claim Arose; Convenience of Parties/Witnesses  \n \n  Private interest factors favor transfer of this case to the Midd le District of Louisiana. \nWhile a plaintiff's choice of forum generally merits deference, “the strong presumption against \ndisturbing plaintiff['s] initial forum of choice .  . . is weakened .  . . when the forum is not \nplaintiff's home forum and  most of the  relevant events occurred elsewhere.”  Great Socialist \nPeople's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya v. Miski , 496 F.Supp. 2d 137, 144-45 (D.D.C. 2007); Demery \nv. Montgomery County, MD , 602  F.Supp.  2d 206, 210 (D.D.C.   2009)  (quoting  Hunter v. \nJohanns, 517  F.Supp. 2d 340, 344 (D.D.C. 2007) ).  It is undisputed that none of the named \nPlaintiffs, nor any potential class member, reside in this District.   \n  Although Plaintiffs and HUD cite the presence of organizational Plaintiff, National Fair \nHousing Alliance (NFHA), whose main o ffice is located in the District of Columbia, to oppose \ntransfer, what Plaintiffs and HUD fail to address is that the Greater New Orleans Fair Housing \nAction Center (GNOFHAC), which maintains its main office in New Orleans, Louisiana, is a \nmember organizat ion of National Fair Housing Alliance.    According to NFHA's website, \nGNOFHAC is a “full service non-profit fair housing organization providing education, outreach, \nand enforcement with respect to the fair housing laws in order to create equal housing \nopportunities in Louisiana and to combat housing discrimination.”    See NFHA website: \nwww.nationalfairhousing.org.  GNOFHAC has an “ Operating Membership” status within the \nNFHA, “a status reserved for private, non-profit, full service fair housing organizations.” Id.   As \na operating member, GNOFHAC receives special access to educational and training resources \nthrough the NFHA.    NFHA also provides assistance to GNOFHAC with methodology \n  34 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 39    Filed 07/08/09   Page 44 of 51\n \ndevelopment, public policy  initiatives, education and outreach strategies, and administrative, \npersonnel and financial functions.   Id.  As a member of NFHA, GNOFHAC is undoubtedly \nrepresenting NFHA’s interests in this litigation.   Accordingly, the location of NFHA should not \nbe a factor precluding transfer of this case and Plaintiffs' choice of forum in this instance is \ndiminished.  \nWhen the events at issue occur in more than one district, a court can consider which \njurisdiction has the  stronger factual nexus to the claims.  Miller v. Insulation Contractors, Inc ., \n608 F.Supp.2d 97, 101–02 (D.D.C. 2009) (citing O'Shea v. Int'l Broth. of Teamsters,  2005 WL \n486143, at *3 (D.D.C. March 2, 2005) ).  There is no dispute the “factual nexus” of this case is \nmore closely tied to the State of Louisiana than the District of Columbia.  Most of the relevant \nevents occurred in Louisiana.  The LRA was created in the Middle District.   The challenged \nAction Plan  – the centerpiece of this litigation  - was created and implemented in the Middle \nDistrict.  The Road Home compensation grant program (Option 1) was created and implemented \nin the Middle District.    All of the named Plaintiffs' (and the poten tial class members') \napplications were processed in the Middle District. All of the property evaluated under the \nAction Plan is located in Louisiana.  As HUD's representative stated:  \nThe State of Louisiana is responsible for the implementation, \ndesign, an d administration of the Road Home program in \nconformance with the applicable CDBG pr ogram requirements set \nby HUD.   \n \n(Kome Declaration, Dkt. 22-2, ¶ 15.) \nWhile HUD's oversight and/or involvement, regardless of the extent thereof, may have \ntaken place in or from this District, and HUD's record may be located here, most of the relevant \nevents underlying Plaintiffs' claims occurred in Louisiana, not the District of Columbia.   Further, \nall of the evidence, including the LRA's record is located in the Middle Di strict of Louisiana. \n  35 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 39    Filed 07/08/09   Page 45 of 51\n \nThis matter involves Louisiana property and Louisiana residents.   The District of Columbia has \nno interest in this case and its citizens should not be burdened with this litigation.  Miller v. \nToyota Motor Corp ., supra.  Conversely, the State of Louisiana  – in particular, the Middle \nDistrict - has a significant interest in providing redress to the alleged injuries sustained by the \nnamed Plaintiffs (and potential class members)– all of whom are Louisiana residents.  \nFurther, it should be noted, the parties have not agreed or stipulated at this time this case \nwould involve solely the administrative record.   Therefore, convenience of witnesses remains a \nrelevant factor at this stage.   See Demery, 602 F.Supp. 2d at 210; Montgomery v. STG Intern. , \n532 F.Supp. 2d 29, 33 n. 5 (D.D.C. 2008)  (holding convenience of the witnesses refers to the \npossibility of having their live testimony at trial).   There is no dispute the Middle District  of \nLouisiana would be a more convenient forum for witnesses.   The named Plaintiffs reside in \nLouisiana.  Potential class members likely reside in the State of Louisiana.  LRA officials and \nemployees are in Louisiana.  Defendant, Paul Rainwater, is a Louisiana resident.  The documents \nrelative to the Plaintiffs' Road Home grants, applications, grant amounts, disbursements are all \nlocated in Louisiana.  Although HUD contends “all of its witnesses and documents” are in this \nDistrict, there can be no compariso n to the number of individuals from Louisiana, including \nRainwater, who would be required to travel at considerable expense, hardship and inconvenience \nto litigate this case or for trial.  Accordingly, private interest factors warrant transfer of this case  \nto the Middle District of Louisiana.  \n     2.  Public Interest Factors \nIn addition, public interest factors favor transfer of this case to the Middle District, or \nalternatively, the Eastern District of Louisiana. 19  There is a presumption the Middle District  of \n                                                \n19   See Otay Mesa Property L.P. v U.S. Department of Interior, 584 F.Supp.2d 122, 126 (D.D.C. 2008) (identifying \npublic interest factors).  \n  36 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 39    Filed 07/08/09   Page 46 of 51\n \nLouisiana is equally familiar with the federal laws at issue. Although this case may not involve \nissues of Louisiana state law, it involves Louisiana residents and Louisiana property, factors \ninvoking a substantially stronger local interest with the Mid dle District of Louisiana, rather than \nthe District of Columbia.  The challenged decision of the LRA was made in the Middle District \nof Louisiana.    The LRA's decision concerning grant amounts directly affected citizens of \nLouisiana – not citizens of the Di strict of Columbia.   The underlying controversy involves \nLouisiana citizens suing to redress alleged injuries occurring in Louisiana.   While there may be \nno issue concerning local property laws, it is undisputed this matter involves property located in \nthe State of Louisiana, not the District of Columbia. \nFinally, Plaintiffs have not alleged personal involvement by an individual of HUD \nlocated in the District of Columbia, but have named individually, Paul Rainwater, a citizen and \nresident of the State of Lo uisiana.  Although HUD contends this controversy “could” affect its \nadministration of the CDBG program in the “future,” such vague possibilities do not warrant \nlitigating these particular claims in the District of Columbia.  \n3.  Balance of Private and Public Interest Factors Favor \n  Transfer of This Litigation Involving Louisiana Properties  \n \nIn Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance v. Norton,  315 F.Supp. 2d 82 (D.D.C. 2004),  \nplaintiffs opposed the transfer of the case to the District of Utah, contending the controversy was \nsubstantially tied to Washington D.C. ( “D.C.”) because the wilderness policy changes at issue \nmade by D.C. senior officials had a direct impact on lease sales in Utah.   Plaintiffs relied on \nevidence establishing such ties, including an email and paper trail an employee in the Bureau of \nLand Management’s (BLM) Utah state office sent to its D.C. headquarters, as well as a two -day \nworkshop BLM headquarters conducted in Utah instructing Utah BLM personnel on  leasing the \nlands in dispute.   Plaintiffs also claimed one BLM official in D.C. was “intimately involved” \n  37 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 39    Filed 07/08/09   Page 47 of 51\n \nwith the National Energy Policy and emailed staff in BLM's Utah office ten times regarding \nlease sales. Defendants argued there was no “special oversi ght” by D.C. of BLM's mineral \nleasing program  - BLM's Utah office administered the public lands at issue, BLM's Utah \nDirector had authority to issue oil and gas leases, and the lease sale occurred in Utah under the \ndirection of BLM's Utah office.   BLM's headquarters officials involvement stemmed from the \nwilderness policy change, and the resulting guidance to BLM's Utah state office was meant to \nensure such change occurred.  \nThis Court noted although extensive involvement by headquarters has, in some instances, \njustified keeping a case in the District of Columbia, “mere involvement on the part of federal \nagencies, or some federal officials who are located in Washington, D.C., is not determinative.” \nSouthern Utah Wilderness Alliance, 315 F.Supp. 2d at 87 (citing Shawnee Tribe v. United States, \n298 F.Supp. 2d 21, 25–26 (D.D.C. 2002) .  This Court further held neither party would be \nsignificantly inconvenienced by litigating the case in Utah.   Although plaintiff had offices in \nD.C., it was headquartered in Salt Lake City and one of plaintiffs' attorneys resided in Utah. \nFinally, this Court observed that even if the case involved a review of the administrative record, \nthe location of the record was afforded little weight.   Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance , 315 \nF.Supp. 2d at 88 (citing Air Line Pilots Ass'n v. Eastern Air Lines, 672 F.Supp. 525, 527 (D.D.C. \n1987) (holding location of administrative record afforded little weight).   Because the issues \nprimarily involved decisions of officials in Utah, and no relevant records or witnesses were \navailable exclusively in the District of Columbia jurisdiction, the private interests of the parties \nfavored transfer to the District of Utah.  \nThis  Court also found public interest factors favored transfer. The controversy was \nlocalized because it involved Utah lands  – affording a strong local interest in having this case \n  38 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 39    Filed 07/08/09   Page 48 of 51\n \nheard in Utah.  Notwithstanding the national attention of the issue, the dispute was focused on 21 \nparcels of land in Utah.   This Court noted land is a localized interest because its management \ndirectly touches local citizens.  Id. citing Sierra Club v. Flowers, 276 F.Supp. 2d 62, 71 (D.D.C. \n2003) (granting motion to transfer suit involving the Florida Everglades in part because of the \n“depth and extent of Florida's interest”);  Trout Unlimited  v. U.S. Dep’t of Agriculture , 944 \nF.Supp. 13, 17 (granting motion to transfer to Colorado a suit involving the United States Forest \nService's decision to issue an easement for the operation of a dam and reservoir on public lands \nbecause of the “impact that the resolution of this action will have upon the affected lands, waters, \nwildlife and people of that sta te”).  This Court further noted “it makes sense that these alleged \nconsequences would be most particularly felt in Utah, and thus that the courts of Utah would \nhave a clear interest in resolving the dispute.”     Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance,  315 \nF.Supp.2d at 89 (citing, Trout Unlimited, 944 F.Supp. at 20 (it is appropriate to consider “those \nwhose rights and interests are in fact most vitally affected by the suit”) (citing Adams v. Bell, 711 \nF.2d 161, 167 n. 34 (D.C. Cir. 1983) ).  Accordingly, this Court held Utah's interest in the case \nwas substantial, outweighed any interest in litigating in D.C., and found transfer appropriate at \nthe early stage of litigation because the dispute would have the greatest impact on the citizens of \nUtah.  \nThe balance of private and public interest factors favor transfer of this case to the Middle \nDistrict of Louisiana.  The consequences of Plaintiffs' lawsuit would be most particularly felt in \nthe State of Louisiana  – not the District of Columbia.   Louisiana's interest in litigating claims \ninvolving Louisiana property far outweighs any interest the District of Columbia has in \nadjudicating such matters.   Regardless of the extent of HUD's involvement, the underlying \ncontroversy affects and involves the State o f Louisiana, its residents and its property.   The \n  39 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 39    Filed 07/08/09   Page 49 of 51\n \nconnection to the District of Columbia is too attenuated to justify using the judicial resources of \nthis Court.  The balance of private and public interest factors weigh in favor of transferring this \ncase at this early stage, and Defendant, Rainwater respectfully asks this Court to transfer this \nmatter to the Middle District of Louisiana. \nIX.  Conclusion \n  For the foregoing reasons, this Court should grant Defendant Paul Rainwater’s Motion to \nDismiss pursuant  to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), or, alternatively, transfer this case to \nfederal district courts in either Baton Rouge or New Orleans, Louisiana. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n            /s/ RENEE CULOTTA       \nA.J.

No. 1:08-cv-1938-HHK \n \nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING \nAND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ SECOND MOTION FOR A TEMPORARY  \nRESTRAINING ORDER AND A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n \nPlaintiffs Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center, et al., respectfully file this \nSecond Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and a Preliminary Injunction against \nDefendant Robin Keegan – the former Executive Director of the Louisiana Recovery Authority \n(“LRA”) and current Executive Director of the LRA’s successor agency, the Louisiana Office of \nCommunity Development (“OCD”). \nPlaintiffs seek relief on behalf of the subset of Plaintiffs who have not yet received their \ninitial grant awards under the Road Home Program and who are in imminent danger of receiving \ninitial grant awards based upon a formula that this Court concluded “may well be a \ndiscriminatory.”  Dkt. No. 61, at 17.  Specifically, Plaintiffs seek an immediate temporary \nrestraining order and a preliminary injunction enjoining Keegan from using a formula that takes \ninto account pre-storm home values (which this Court has already found is likely a \ndiscriminatory criterion) to calculate and disburse any future grants until the case is adjudicated \non the merits.  As of the date of this filing, Keegan has refused to alter the formula for \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 62    Filed 07/21/10   Page 2 of 4\ncalculating and disbursing future grant awards.  At any point, Keegan may (as she has in the \npast) use the discriminatory formula to calculate and disburse initial grant awards to Plaintiffs \nwho have yet to have their first closings under the Road Home Program.  By virtue of the \nCourt’s prior rulings in this case, such action may forever preclude Plaintiffs from obtaining \nrecalculated awards. \nFor the reasons stated above and in Plaintiffs’ attached memorandum, they satisfy all of \nthe requirements for this Court to issue temporary and preliminary injunctive relief.  Without a \ntemporary and preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm by forever losing \ntheir opportunity to obtain equitable relief for violations of federal anti-discrimination laws.   \nPlaintiffs respectfully request the Court to enter immediately the proposed order granting \ntheir request for temporary injunctive relief to preserve the status quo, and to schedule a hearing \non Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction at the earliest possible date convenient to the \nCourt and the parties.  As Keegan may take action at any time to calculate and disburse initial \ngrant awards by using a discriminatory formula, it is necessary for a temporary restraining order \nto be in place until the Court is able to rule on Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction. \n \nDated: July 21, 2010        Respectfully submitted, \n \n \n /s/ Damon T.

Defendants Keegan and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development \n(“HUD”) are in violation of Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3604, 3605, \nand 3608 (the “Fair Housing Act” or “Title VIII”),1 and the Housing and Community \nDevelopment Act of 1974, 42 U.S.C. § 5304 (the “HCDA”), by developing and implementing a \ngrant formula that has a disparate impact on African American homeowners in New Orleans.2  \nThe formula adversely affects African-American homeowners, as it ties rebuilding grants to pre-\nstorm home values, which are much lower in predominantly African-American communities \nthan predominantly white communities, leaving African-American families with more frequent \nand larger gaps between their rebuilding grants and the cost to rebuild their homes, and harming \ntheir efforts to return to their homes in New Orleans.  Compl., Dkt. No. 1, ¶¶ 52-60. \n  The Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center, National Fair Housing Alliance, \nand five African-American homeowners from New Orleans (collectively, “Plaintiffs”), filed this \nlawsuit on behalf of all African-American homeowners in New Orleans who have participated in \n                                                 \n1 Section 3604(a) makes it unlawful to “make unavailable or deny” housing to any person \nbecause of race.  42 U.S.C. § 3604(a).  Section 3605(a) makes it unlawful to discriminate on the basis of \nrace in the availability, terms, or conditions of residential real estate-related transactions.  Id. § 3605(a).  \nAnd § 3608(e)(5) of Title VIII requires HUD and recipients of federal funds to “administer the programs \nand activities relating to housing and urban development in a manner affirmatively to further” fair \nhousing.  Id. § 3608(e)(5).  Finally, § 5304(b)(2) of the HCDA requires that the use of all CDBG funds be \nconducted in a manner that “affirmatively further[s] fair housing.”  Id. § 5304(b)(2).   \n \n2 The City of New Orleans and the political subdivision Orleans Parish are coterminous.  \nPlaintiffs refer throughout this brief to New Orleans and Orleans Parish interchangeably. \n \n  1 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 62-1    Filed 07/21/10   Page 8 of 29\nthe Road Home Program whose initial grant awards were calculated, or will be calculated, based \nupon the pre-storm value of their homes.  Compl., Dkt. No. 1, ¶ 21.3 \nIn denying Plaintiffs’ first Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and a Preliminary \nInjunction, Dkt. Nos. 59 and 61, this Court previously ruled that it was barred by the Eleventh \nAmendment from ordering an ultimate remedy that would require the recalculation of initial \ngrant awards that had already been received by beneficiaries of the Road Home Program, even \nthough those awards were likely based upon a formula that had a discriminatory impact on \nAfrican-American homeowners.  It was primarily on this basis that the prior request for \npreliminary relief (freezing of assets in the form of surplus funds) was denied.4   \nPlaintiffs now seek relief on behalf of individuals who have not yet received their initial \ngrant awards under the Road Home Program and who are in imminent danger of receiving initial \ngrant awards based upon what this Court concluded “may well be a discriminatory formula.”  \nDkt. No. 61, at 17.  Specifically, Plaintiffs seek a temporary restraining order and a preliminary \ninjunction enjoining Keegan from using a formula that takes into account pre-storm home values \n(which this Court has already found is likely a discriminatory criterion, see id. at 7-8) to calculate \nand disburse any future grants until the case is adjudicated on the merits.  Insofar as this second \n                                                 \n3 The Court noted in its July 7, 2010, Memorandum Opinion that Plaintiffs did not seek to \ncircumscribe their first motion such that it would be limited to Road Home beneficiaries who had yet to \nreceive initial grant awards, Dkt. No. 61, at 14, n. 12, and also suggested that Plaintiffs did not wish to \nrepresent those individuals, id. at 15, n. 13.  However, the Complaint in this action clearly indicates that \nPlaintiffs seek relief on behalf of all current and future beneficiaries who had, or will have, their grants \nbased upon the discriminatory formula.  And while the first motion sought relief for all of these Plaintiffs, \nthe instant motion seeks relief only on behalf of the subset of Plaintiffs who have not yet received their \ninitial grant awards. \n \n4 Plaintiffs dispute the denial of their Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and a \nPreliminary Injunction (Order, Dkt. No. 59 and Memorandum Opinion, Dkt. No. 61) and reserve their \nright to appeal. \n  2 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 62-1    Filed 07/21/10   Page 9 of 29\nmotion pertains only to future grant awards, the requested relief does not disturb this Court’s \nruling that any order “mandating that LRA make payments to Road Home beneficiaries who \nhave already received funds” would violate the Eleventh Amendment.  Id. at 10 (emphasis \nadded). \nWithout temporary and preliminary injunctive relief, this subset of Plaintiffs may forever \nlose their right to obtain a remedy in this action, which seeks to vindicate the civil rights of \nAfrican-American homeowners.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs respectfully request an order from this \nCourt to prevent further discrimination, thus preserving the status quo until it issues a decision on \nthe merits.  \n \nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \nOn November 12, 2008, Plaintiffs filed their Complaint, alleging that Defendants \ndeveloped, implemented, and oversaw the Road Home Program in violation of the \nnondiscrimination and affirmative fair housing provisions of the Fair Housing Act and the \nHCDA, because the program has a disparate impact on African American homeowners as \ncompared to whites.  Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to end the discriminatory \noperation of the Road Home Program and to direct the Defendants to develop and apply a new, \nnon-discriminatory grant formula.  Compl., Dkt. No. 1, at 17.  \nOn March 6, 2009, HUD moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and for failure to state \na claim on which relief can be granted.  Dkt. No. 22.  On May 5, 2009, Keegan moved to dismiss \nbased on a lack of jurisdiction, failure to state a claim, and a sovereign immunity defense.  Dkt. \nNo. 28.  Keegan also moved for a transfer of venue to the Middle District of Louisiana.  Id.  On \nJune 5, 2009, Plaintiffs opposed the Defendants’ motions to dismiss and transfer venue.  Dkt. \n  3 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 62-1    Filed 07/21/10   Page 10 of 29\nNo. 34.  The same day, HUD responded to Keegan’s motions, arguing that the Plaintiffs have a \nright to sue Keegan under the doctrine of Ex parte Young; Keegan’s sovereign immunity defense \nis meritless and that the action should not be transferred.  Dkt. No. 33.  On July 8, 2009, Keegan \nand HUD filed reply briefs in support of their respective motions.  Dkt. Nos. 38-40. \nOn May 24, 2010, the Court scheduled a hearing on the motions to dismiss and directed \nthe parties to address (1) whether Ex parte Young permits an order precluding a state officer from \nusing funds that have not yet been released in a manner that violates federal law, and (2) how \nmuch money is available to the Road Home Program but has not yet been disbursed to Louisiana \nfor that use, and how much money Louisiana and/or the LRA have that has not yet been \ndisbursed to Road Home recipients.  Dkt. No. 45.  After conferring with HUD and Keegan, \nPlaintiffs filed their first Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction.  \nDkt. No. 50.  On June 4, 2010, the Court issued a clarification of its May 24, 2010 Order.  Dkt. \nNo. 52.  After responsive briefing by the parties, Dkt. Nos. 57 and 58, the Court set a hearing on \nPlaintiffs’ first motion for June 25, 2010.  After hearing oral argument on that date, the Court \ndenied Plaintiffs’ motion for injunctive relief in an Order dated June 29, 2010, Dkt. No. 59, and \nissued a Memorandum Opinion setting forth its reasons for denying the motion on July 7, 2010, \nDkt. No. 61 (“July 7 Opinion”). \n \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nIn the interest of brevity, Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the factual recitations set \nforth in their previous pleadings:  Compl., Dkt. No. 1, ¶¶ 1-73; Plaintiffs’ Memorandum and \nPoints of Authorities in Support of Their [First] Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and \n  4 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 62-1    Filed 07/21/10   Page 11 of 29\nA Preliminary Injunction, Dkt. No. 50-1, at 10-28; and Plaintiffs’ Supplemental Memorandum in \nResponse to the Court’s June 4, 2010 Clarification Order, Dkt. No. 53, at 2-7.  However, \nPlaintiffs highlight the following facts that are particularly relevant to the instant motion: \nSource of funds \nIn the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, Congress established a $19.7 \nbillion Disaster Recovery Grant program.  Through three separate allocations of Community \nDevelopment Block Grant (“CDBG”) funds in 2005, 2006, and 2007, Congress provided funds \nfor necessary expenses related to disaster relief, long-term recovery, and rebuilding in the most \naffected areas in the Gulf of Mexico.5  The first two statutes appropriated a combined $16.7 \nbillion to five affected states—Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, Florida, and Alabama—for \nactivities authorized under the CDBG statute.  See 2005 Act, 119 Stat. at 2779-81 ($11.5 billion \nappropriation); 2006 Act, 120 Stat. at 472-73 ($5.2 billion appropriation).  But the final \nappropriation authorized an additional $3 billion of supplemental CDBG grants “solely for the \npurpose of covering costs associated with otherwise compensated but eligible claims that were \nfiled on or before July 31, 2007, under the Road Home program,” which operates solely in \nLouisiana.  2007 Act, 121 Stat. at 1343-44.  The funds that remain for this program all come \nfrom the third supplemental appropriation, as the funds for the first two appropriations have \nalready been exhausted.  Congress required that all funds be disbursed in compliance with the \n                                                 \n5 See Department of Defense, Emergency Supplemental Appropriations to Address Hurricanes in the \nGulf of Mexico, and Pandemic Influenza Act, 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-148, 119 Stat. 2680, 2779-81 (Dec. \n30, 2005) (the “2005 Act”); Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on \nTerror, and Hurricane Recovery, 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-234, 120 Stat. 418, 472-73 (June 15, 2006) (the \n“2006 Act”); Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-116, 121 Stat. 1295, \n1343-44 (Nov. 13, 2007) (the “2007 Act”).   \n  5 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 62-1    Filed 07/21/10   Page 12 of 29\nFair Housing Act.  71 Fed. Reg. 7,666, 7,671 (Feb. 13, 2006); 71 Fed. Reg. 63,337, 63,339 \n(October 30, 2006); 72 Fed. Reg. 70,472, 70,473 (Dec. 11, 2007). \nOngoing Discrimination \nThe formula for computing the grants, which was adopted by LRA and approved by \nHUD, provides that the grant amount is based chiefly upon the lower of two values: (1) the \nhome’s pre-storm value (minus any other compensation the applicant received for loss to the \nstructure, such as insurance proceeds), or (2) the cost of repairing damage to the home (minus \nany other compensation the applicant received for loss to the structure).  Dkt. No. 61, at 3.  As \nthis Court has noted, because homes in predominantly African-American communities have \nlower pre-storm values than comparable homes in predominantly white communities, and \nbecause the Road Home Program provides grants based on the lesser of the pre-storm value or \nthe cost of repairing damage, African Americans are more likely than whites to receive a Road \nHome grant based on the pre-storm value of their home rather than on the much higher cost of \nrepairing damage.  Id. at 8.  As a result, African-American homeowners are more likely than \nwhite homeowners to have a gap between their rebuilding resources and the cost to rebuild and, \non average, their gaps are larger.  Id. \nAs of the filing of this motion, a number of Road Home Program applicants have yet to \nreceive initial grant awards.  And Keegan has thus far failed to alter the discriminatory formula \nfor those remaining Road Home beneficiaries who have yet to receive initial grant awards.  \nTherefore, many of them face the immediate prospect of receiving insufficient initial grant \nawards based upon a discriminatory formula.  Plaintiffs are not able to ascertain the precise \nnumber of individuals in this situation.  However, Defendant Keegan estimates that as of June \n  6 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 62-1    Filed 07/21/10   Page 13 of 29\n11, 2010, 179 African-American homeowners in Orleans Parish fell into this category, see Dkt. \nNo. 57, at 17-18. \nImportantly, any of these individuals may receive initial grants at any moment, locking in \ndiscrimination in a manner that the Court has indicated may not be undone. \n \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \n   “To warrant preliminary injunctive relief, the moving party must show (1) a substantial \nlikelihood of success on the merits, (2) that it would suffer irreparable injury if the injunction \nwere not granted, (3) that an injunction would not substantially injure other interested parties, \nand (4) that the public interest would be furthered by the injunction.”  Chaplaincy of Full Gospel \nChurches v. England, 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (“CFGC”) (citations omitted).   \n“These factors should be balanced against one another and ‘[i]f the arguments for one \nfactor are particularly strong, an injunction may issue even if the arguments in other areas are \nrather weak.’” Jasperson v.

United States, 679 F. \nSupp. 2d 37, 42 (D.D.C. 2010) (“Both the United States Supreme Court and the Court of \nAppeals for the D.C.

Moreover, \nwhen a plaintiff has demonstrated a substantial likelihood that a defendant has violated specific \nfair housing statutes and regulations, the violation alone creates a rebuttable presumption of \nirreparable injury.

Dkt. No. 61, at 7-8.  Under the Court’s reasoning, \nrelief on behalf of homeowners who have yet to receive grant awards is prospective, not \nretrospective, relief, thereby falling within the exception to Eleventh Amendment sovereign \nimmunity recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court in Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908). \nSecond, the harm will be irreparable because this Court has ruled that once initial grant \nawards are calculate and disbursed, requiring the recalculation of those grants constitutes \nimpermissible retrospective relief.  See Dkt. No. 61, at 13-15.  Thus, Plaintiffs will lack an \nadequate remedy to the discrimination they will suffer if Keegan is permitted to issue \ndiscriminatory grant awards. \n                                                 \n6 See also Cousins v. Bray, 297 F. Supp. 2d 1027, 1041 (S.D. Ohio 2003) (“[B]ecause of the strong \nnational policy against race discrimination in housing, once a plaintiff has demonstrated a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits of a claim of housing discrimination, irreparable harm will be presumed.”); Remed \nRecovery Care Centers v. Township of Willistown, 36 F. Supp. 2d 676, 688 (E.D. Pa. 1999) (“[A] \nviolation of the [FHA] creates a presumption of irreparable harm that a defendant must rebut in order for \na preliminary injunction not to issue.”); Stewart B. McKinney Found., Inc. v. Town Plan and Zoning \nComm’n of the Town of Fairfield, 790 F. Supp. 1197, 1208 (D. Conn. 1992) (“[I]rreparable harm may be \npresumed in this case because . . . the plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to establish that its rights \nunder the [FHA] have been violated.”). \n  9 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 62-1    Filed 07/21/10   Page 16 of 29\nThird, the proposed relief—prohibiting Keegan from using the pre-storm value criterion \nfor future grant awards—will not harm Defendants or any other interested parties.   \nFinally, the public interest strongly supports the issuance of the requested relief and an \ninjunction will stop any further discrimination in the nation’s largest federal emergency housing \nprogram—a program to which Congress specifically attached fair housing and non-\ndiscrimination protections. \nA.   Plaintiffs Have a Substantial Likelihood of Success on the Merits  \n1.  The pre-storm value criterion violates the Fair Housing Act. \nThough federal courts have alternately applied two possible standards to assess disparate \nimpact claims under the Fair Housing Act, this Court adopted the burden-shifting framework \nfavored by most courts.  See Dkt. No. 61, at 7-8.  Under this framework “once the plaintiff \ndemonstrates that the challenged practice has a disproportionate impact, the burden shifts to the \ndefendant to ‘prove and that no alternative would serve that interest with less discriminatory \neffect.’” Dkt. No. 61, at 7-8 (quoting 2922 Sherman Avenue Tenants’ Ass’n v. Dist. of Columbia, \n444 F.3d 673, 680 (D.C. Cir. 2006)). \nPlaintiffs have marshaled a considerable amount of statistical, documentary, and \ntestimonial evidence demonstrating how and why the Road Home Program grant formula has a \ndisparate impact on African-American homeowners.     \nThis evidence included statistics from the U.S. Census showing that homes owned by \nAfrican Americans in New Orleans have lower values, on average, than homes owned by whites, \nDkt. No. 50-1, at 8-9, Ex. P; a published report from the organization Policy Link, which \nconcludes that, on average, African-American applicants to the Road Home Program received \n  10 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 62-1    Filed 07/21/10   Page 17 of 29\nfunds in amounts further below the costs to rebuild their homes than white applicants, Dkt. No. \n50-1, at 12-15, Ex. S; supporting declarations, Dkt. No 50-1, Ex. T; and admissions from \nKeegan’s predecessor, Paul Rainwater, that home values in African-American neighborhoods \ntend to be lower than in white neighborhoods and that he was “sure” that African-American \nhomeowners were more likely than whites to receive awards based on the value of their homes \nthan the cost of repairs, Dkt. No. 50-1, at 15-16, Ex. N, at 23-24.   \nEven in light of this overwhelming evidence, Keegan failed to articulate any bona \nfide interest in using the pre-storm value criterion for some, but not all, homeowners; nor \ncould she point to the absence of a non-discriminatory alternative. \nBased upon Plaintiffs’ unrebutted evidence, this Court applied the burden shifting \nframework that the majority of Circuits have adopted to adjudicate FHA disparate impact claims \nand concluded that Plaintiffs have a high likelihood of succeeding in their disparate impact \nclaim: \nPlaintiffs have demonstrated that they would likely be able to make out this prima \nfacie case after discovery. The statistical and anecdotal evidence they submit to \nthe Court leads to a strong inference that, on average, African-American \nhomeowners received awards that fell farther short of the cost of repairing their \nhomes than did white recipients. Keegan’s attacks on that evidence are \nunpersuasive. Plaintiffs need not make a showing at this stage of the \nproceedings, before discovery and when briefing is necessarily rushed, sufficient \nto prove the merits of their case. Keegan neither demonstrates that plaintiffs’ \nstatistics or logic is flawed nor provides data about the administration of the \nProgram that would show what effect the Option 1 formula has had. Cf. Berger v. \nIron Workers Reinforced Rodmen Local 201, 843 F.2d 1395, 1412 (D.C. Cir. \n1988) (“Defendants may also attempt to undermine plaintiffs’ prima facie case \nby attacking the validity of plaintiffs’ statistical evidence, or by introducing \nstatistical evidence of their own showing that the challenged practice did not have \nracially disproportionate results.” (citation omitted)). She has also offered no \nlegitimate reason for taking pre-storm home values into account in calculating \nProgram awards.  \n \n  11 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 62-1    Filed 07/21/10   Page 18 of 29\nMem. Op., Dkt. No. 61, at 8.  This finding constitutes the law of the case for purposes of \nthe present motion.  Kimberlin v. Quinlan, 199 F.3d 496, 500 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (“[T]he \nsame issue presented a second time in the same case in the same court should lead to the \nsame result.”) (quoting LaShawn A. v. Barry, 87 F.3d 1389, 1393 (D.C. Cir. 1996)); Does \nI through III v. District of Columbia, 593 F.Supp.2d 115, 122 (D.D.C. 2009) (Kennedy, \nJ.) (“The [l]aw-of-the-case doctrine refers to a family of rules embodying the general \nconcept that a court involved in later phases of a lawsuit should not re-open questions \ndecided (i.e., established as the law of the case) by that court or a higher one in earlier \nphases.”) (internal quotes omitted). \n2.  The proposed injunctive relief does not implicate sovereign \nimmunity concerns. \n \nThe Eleventh Amendment generally bars suits against states absent the relevant \nstate’s consent to be sued or some abrogation of the state’s immunity by Congress, \nPapasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 276 (1986).  However, in Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 \n(1908), the Supreme Court announced an exception to that immunity that allows federal \ncourts to enjoin state officials like Keegan from acting contrary to federal law, “either \nbecause their action is alleged to violate the Constitution directly or because it is contrary \nto a federal statute or regulation that is the supreme law of the land.”  Vann v. \nKempthorne, 534 F.3d 741, 749 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (quoting CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT ET \nAL., FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 4232 (3d ed. 2007)). \n  “In determining whether the doctrine of Ex parte Young avoids an Eleventh Amendment \nbar to suit, a court need only conduct a ‘straightforward inquiry into whether [the] complaint \nalleges an ongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly characterized as \n  12 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 62-1    Filed 07/21/10   Page 19 of 29\nprospective.’”  Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm’n, 535 U.S. 635, 645 (2002) (quoting \nIdaho v. Coeur d’Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U.S. 261, 296 (1997) (O’Connor, J., concurring)). \nThis analysis typically precludes the payment of damages from the state treasury to correct a \nprior unlawful act by a state official.  Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 663-64 (1974) (holding \nthat federal courts lack jurisdiction to require a state to spend money that “should have been \npaid, but was not”). \nThe Court denied Plaintiffs’ first request for a temporary restraining order and \npreliminary injunction based primarily upon its finding that part of the ultimate remedy would \nrequire the recalculation of initial grant awards of Road Home Program beneficiaries who had \nalready received awards under a discriminatory formula—relief that the court found was \nretrospective relief akin to money damages paid out of the state treasury.  Dkt. No. 61, at 14-15.  \nHowever, the Court also indicated that it would have jurisdiction to provide a remedy for those \nRoad Home Program beneficiaries who had not yet received initial grant awards, as any order as \nto those individuals would constitute forward-looking prospective relief: \n[I]t seems to the Court that if the Road Home Program has not been completed, \nthe Court may—if plaintiff’s arguments that Option 1 of the Road Home Program \nviolates federal law are correct—enjoin Keegan from continuing to administer it \nin an unlawful manner. Were the Court to grant injunctive relief of that nature, it \nwould not be ordering the payment of money. Instead, it would be ordering that, \ngoing forward, Keegan may not use the existing formula to disburse funds to \nProgram beneficiaries.  Such relief is the sort permitted under the doctrine of Ex \nparte Young.  See Edelman, 415 U.S. at 664 (holding that prospective injunctive \nrelief, such as the order issued in Ex parte Young itself in which “the Attorney \nGeneral of Minnesota was enjoined to conform his future conduct of that office to \nthe requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment,” is not barred by the Eleventh \nAmendment).  \n \nDkt. No. 52, at 4-5 (emphasis added). \n \n  13 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 62-1    Filed 07/21/10   Page 20 of 29\n  As the Court made clear, the type of relief Plaintiffs’ seek in the instant motion fits \nsquarely within the Ex parte Young exception because Plaintiffs only seek to “enjoin Keegan \nfrom continuing to administer [the Road Home Program] in an unlawful manner.”  Id.  The \ninjunction sought only bars Keegan from using a discriminatory formula to calculate and \ndistribute future grant awards until the case is adjudicated on the merits.  Such relief does not run \nafoul of the Eleventh Amendment because it affects only future grants and prevents \ndiscrimination against beneficiaries who have not yet received initial grant awards.  See Verizon, \nU.S. 535 at 645.  This type of forward-looking injunction involves purely prospective relief.   \n  In addition, even though compliance with the requested preliminary relief may require \nKeegan to issue future grants based upon the estimated cost of damage or some other non-\ndiscriminatory alternative to pre-storm value (a change that could result in Keegan spending \nmore money in order to comply), the relief is still properly characterized as prospective and \ninjunctive.7  See Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 289 (1977) (holding that a court-ordered \nschool desegregation plan that required some incidental expenditure of state funds came within \nthe Ex parte Young exception because it “enjoin[ed] state officials to conform their conduct to \nrequirements of federal law” in the future); United States v. Yonkers Bd. of Educ., 893 F.2d 498, \n503 (2d Cir. 1990) (“[E]ven where the relief requested will require the expenditure of state \nfunds, if it is ancillary to such a prospective injunction it is not barred by the Eleventh \nAmendment.” ).  As such, the Ex parte Young exception is plainly applicable and the Eleventh \nAmendment poses no bar to the requested relief. \n                                                 \n7 In making this argument, Plaintiffs note that the Court determined that the surplus Road Home \nfunds are state funds. Dkt. No. 61, at 11-12.  However, while respectful of the law of the case, Plaintiffs \ndo not concede this point and wish to preserve their argument that these funds are federal funds. \n \n  14 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 62-1    Filed 07/21/10   Page 21 of 29\nB.  Plaintiffs Will Be Irreparably Harmed If This Court Does Not Issue a \nTemporary Restraining Order and a Preliminary Injunction. \n   \nFor an injury to constitute irreparable harm, it “must be ‘certain and great,’ ‘actual and \nnot theoretical,’ and ‘of such imminence that there is a clear and present need for equitable relief \nto prevent irreparable harm.’”  Fraternal Order of Police Library of Cong. Labor Comm., 639 F. \nSupp. 2d at 24 (quoting CFGC, 454 F.3d at 297).  In addition, it “must be ‘beyond remediation,” \nwhich means that “[t]he possibility that adequate compensatory or other corrective relief will be \navailable at a later date, in the ordinary course of litigation weighs heavily against a claim of \nirreparable harm.”  Id. (quoting CFGC, 454 F.3d at 297-98 (citation omitted)); see also 11A \nWRIGHT, MILLER AND KANE, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 2948.1 (2d ed. 1995) (“Only \nwhen the threatened harm would impair the court’s ability to grant an effective remedy is there \nreally a need for preliminary relief.”)). \nIn its July 7, 2010 Memorandum Opinion, this Court concluded that any individual who \nhas already received an initial Road Home grant may not obtain court-ordered relief in the form \nof a recalculated grant, as this would be retrospective relief akin to money damages from the \nstate.  See Dkt. No. 61, at 14-15.  Consequently, Road Home Program beneficiaries who have yet \nto receive initial grant awards face immediate peril.  If these Plaintiffs receive an initial grant \naward based upon the pre-storm value of their homes today, pursuant to the Court’s previous \nOrder, the Court will be powerless to rectify the situation and order recalculation of those grants, \nno matter how damning the evidence of the discriminatory effect.  These Plaintiffs would be \nlocked into the same type of discrimination that now traps thousands of other African-American \nhomeowners in New Orleans.  Under these circumstances, preliminary injunctive relief is clearly \nappropriate in order to protect African American homeowners from discrimination before it \n  15 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 62-1    Filed 07/21/10   Page 22 of 29\nhappens.  See Gresham, 730 F.2d at 1423 (holding that “when a plaintiff who has standing to \nbring suit shows a substantial likelihood that a defendant has violated specific fair housing \nstatutes and regulations, that alone, if unrebutted, is sufficient to support an injunction remedying \nthose violations.”).  \nC.  A Preliminary Injunction Will Not Harm Defendants or Other Interested \nParties. \nNeither the Defendants nor any other interested third parties will suffer harm, let alone \n“substantial harm,” if this Court enjoins Keegan from using the discriminatory pre-storm value \ncriterion to issue future grants to Road Home beneficiaries.  See Jasperson, 460 F. Supp. 2d at 88 \n(“The court must consider . . . whether the issuance of injunctive relief would ‘substantially \nharm’ other parties.”).  Keegan has already made clear in her prior court filings that she has \nsufficient funds to provide non-discriminatory grants to the remaining beneficiaries who have yet \nto receive initial grant awards: \nThe LRA has determined that under the existing formula, the amount of potential \ndisbursements calculated for [eligible members of the Plaintiff class] is $9.224 \nmillion. . . However, the LRA has set aside and reserved a total of $126.6 million \nto pay pending applications for [grants for] eligible Road [H]ome applicants who \nhave not yet had their first closing. \n \nDkt. No. 57, at 18. \n \nThis figure does not account for funds set aside in reserve by the LRA for other \npossible payments under the Road Home Program, including payments for \nappeals, second disbursements, additional compensation grants, individual \nmitigation measures, contaminated drywall and sold homes.  The total about of \nfunds in reserve is $554.5 million \n \nId. at 18, n.10. \n \n[T]here is [sic] sufficient funds in reserve and set-aside to pay eligible pending \ngrant applications. . . . This Court should find that these funds are more than \nsufficient to cover any future grant calculations covered by this suit. \n  16 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 62-1    Filed 07/21/10   Page 23 of 29\n \nId. at 31. \n \nAs such, Keegan would not be injured by the proposed relief.  Moreover, no other \ninterested parties will face harm, let alone substantial harm.  Notably, the proposed injunction \nwould neither stop, nor slow, the flow of funds to Louisiana homeowners who are in need.  \nUnder the terms of the proposed relief, Keegan may still offer grants to all individuals who have \nyet to receive an initial grant award.  However, those awards simply may not be based upon pre-\nstorm value; instead, they must be based upon some other, non-discriminatory alternative, such \nas the estimated cost-of-damage criterion that Keegan has already used for the majority of white \nhome owners.  Moreover, the relief sought would make it more likely that Keegan would finally \naddress the Road Home Program’s failures and discriminatory effect, at least as to some \nbeneficiaries.  And, as the passages above demonstrate, the surplus Road Home funds are ample \nenough to permit Keegan to continue the Road Home Program while also providing appropriate, \nnon-discriminatory grants to Plaintiffs in the future. \nIn evaluating the impact of an injunction on existing Road Home recipients, the Court \nshould note that allowing Keegan to continue using the pre-storm value criterion will actually \nfurther perpetuate discrimination against African-American homeowners.  The balance of harms, \ntherefore, decidedly tips in favor of granting preliminary relief, as the Plaintiffs risk the loss of \nany means to redress the harm giving rise to this action, whereas Defendants and other parties \nfaces no danger at all. \nD.  Granting the Proposed Injunctive Relief is in the Public Interest. \nThe public interest plainly favors enjoining Keegan from using the discriminatory \nformula to issue any further Road Home grants until the case is adjudicated on the merits.  First, \n  17 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 62-1    Filed 07/21/10   Page 24 of 29\n“[t]here can be no doubt that the public interest lies in terminating” such discrimination.  Cook v. \nBillington, No. 82-0400, 1988 WL 35364, at *2 (D.D.C. Mar. 31, 1988).   Indeed, the Supreme \nCourt has recognized that the eradication of housing discrimination serves “an overriding \nsocietal priority.”  United States v. Edward Rose & Sons, 384 F.3d 258, 264 (6th Cir. 2004) \n(quoting Meyer v. Holley, 537 U.S. 280, 290 (2003)).  Moreover, eliminating housing \ndiscrimination and affirmatively promoting fair housing were the very purposes of enacting the \nFair Housing Act.  See 42 U.S.C. § 3601 (“It is the policy of the United States to provide, within \nconstitutional limitations, for fair housing throughout the United States.”); see also Price v. \nPelka, 690 F.2d 98, 101 (6th Cir. 1982) (“The eradication of housing discrimination is a policy \nthat Congress considered to be of the highest priority.”) (citing Trafficante v.

Several courts, \nincluding those within this Circuit, have routinely emphasized that remedying discrimination is \nan important public interest in cases involving violations of the Fair Housing Act.  See, e.g., \nBrown v. Artery Org., Inc., 691 F.

As Congress specifically directed that the Road Home funds be spent \npursuant to federal fair housing and anti-discrimination standards, 2005 Act, 119 Stat. at 2780; \n2006 Act, 120 Stat. at 472-73, “the public interest will be frustrated” if the LRA is permitted to \n“distribute the funds” in direct contravention of the civil rights standards “dictated by Congress.”  \nPopulation Inst., 797 F.2d at 1082; see also Letter from Rep. Maxine Waters to HUD Secretary \nShaun Donovan (Apr. 14, 2010), Dkt. No. 50-1, Ex. gg, at 1-2 (stating that the Road Home \nProgram “appears to contravene the fair housing protections enshrined in federal law—\nprotections that were explicitly mandated by Congress when it funded the Road Home \n[P]rogram.”).  Issuing the proposed preliminary injunction would further the stated purposes of \nthe Road Home Program and Congress’ intent, as well. \n                                                 \n8 Likewise, outside the fair housing context, courts have found that the public interest favors \ngranting injunctive relief in the face of a discriminatory formula promulgated by a state agency.  See \nSouth Camden Citizens in Action v. N.J. Dep’t of Env. Prot., 145 F. Supp. 2d 446, 502 (D.N.J. 2001) \n(concluding the public interest favored plaintiff, in part because “requiring the [state agency] to comply \nwith the EPA’s Title VI implementing regulations is inherently in the public interest, insofar as it ensures \nthe protection of civil rights”).   \n \n  19 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 62-1    Filed 07/21/10   Page 26 of 29\nFinally, if the Court preserves the status quo by preventing Keegan from discriminating \nagainst the prescribed subset of Plaintiffs, nearly 200 African-American homeowners in New \nOrleans will likely receive first-time Road Home grants that will help them finish repairing their \nhomes.  Cf. id. at 2 (stating that the Road Home Program’s “discrimination . . . poses a major \nobstacle to rebuilding the great city of New Orleans and enabling its people to return home,” and \nthat many African American families “impacted by this discriminatory policy . . . still face \ninsurmountable barriers to rebuilding.”).  Undoubtedly, completing these rebuilding efforts, \nespecially in predominantly African-American neighborhoods, will improve the lives of \nresidents, homeowners, and communities in New Orleans in so many tangible and intangible \nways. \nAs this court has expressly recognized, rehabilitating communities is in the public \ninterest.  Brown, 654 F. Supp. at 1119 (noting that the argument that rehabilitating apartment \ncomplexes is in the public interest has “obvious merit”).  Surely the same logic applies to \nrebuilding thousands of homes in a historic American city that was devastated by Hurricane \nKatrina.    \nIn short, overwhelming legal authority and evidence demonstrates that a preliminary \ninjunction will further the public interest by remedying costly discrimination, ensuring that the \nnation’s largest federal housing program is administered according to the express fair housing \nmandates of Congress, and assisting thousands of homeowners to complete their repairs. \n \n \n  20 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 62-1    Filed 07/21/10   Page 27 of 29\nCONCLUSION \nAs the fifth anniversary of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita approaches, New Orleanians are \nstill struggling to recover.  Many plaintiffs in this action have already had their dreams \nundermined by having their initial Road Home grant awards based not on a realistic factor such \nas the actual cost to repair the damage to their homes, but rather on the pre-storm market value of \ntheir homes—a criterion that clearly leads to rank discrimination.   But some have yet to receive \ninitial grant awards at all.  Ironically, as this subset of Plaintiffs clamors for funds that they \ndesperately need to rebuild their homes five years after the storms, Keegan proposes to continue \na pattern of discrimination by offering them insufficient grants based upon the discriminatory \npre-storm value criterion.  At any moment, Keegan may issue these initial grant awards.  Under \nthis court’s previous rulings, if these plaintiffs receive even a portion of these funds they will be \nforever denied an opportunity to obtain a recalculation of their grant awards on a non-\ndiscriminatory basis.  Under these circumstances, preliminary injunctive relief is clearly \nappropriate in order to address an ongoing violation of the law and to prevent further \ndiscrimination. \nFor the foregoing reasons, pending this Court’s consideration of Plaintiffs’ claims on the \nmerits, the Court should temporarily restrain and preliminarily enjoin Keegan from using the pre-\nstorm value criterion to calculate and disburse further Road Home Homeowner Assistance \nProgram grants. \n \n \n \n  21 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 62-1    Filed 07/21/10   Page 28 of 29\nDated: July 21, 2010        Respectfully submitted, \n \n \n /s/ Damon T.

R. Civ. P. 65.   \nOn July 26, 2010, Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal appealing this Court’s Order denying \ntheir first motion for temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction. Plaintiffs’ second \nmotion for temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction seeks identical relief on \nbehalf of the same individuals for whom relief was sought by virtue of Plaintiffs’ first motion \nand for whom Plaintiffs’ counsel declined representing at oral argum ent on Plaintiffs’ first \nmotion.  Keegan submits Plaintiffs’ filing of a notice of appeal divests this Court of jurisdiction \nto entertain Plaintiffs’ second motion. \nIn addition, Keegan submits  Plaintiffs’ second request for a temporary restraining order \nand/or preliminary injunction remains premature at this stage in the litigation since this Court has \nnot yet decided and/or issued a ruling as to whether it has subject matter jurisdiction in this case \nand the proper venue for this case. 1  This Court should not address Plaintiffs’ requested relief \nwithout first deciding the issue of whether it can and will exercise jurisdiction over this case.   \nAlternatively, Keegan maintains  Plaintiffs are not entitled to a temporary restraining \norder and/or a preliminary injunction.2  They cannot show a likelihood of success on the merits, \nirreparable injury or that the injunctive relief is in the public interest.   The evidence relied upon \nby the Court in its Memorandum Opinion dated July 6, 2010, in suggesting the Road Hom e \n                                                \n1   Keegan adopts and incorporates by reference all defenses raised in her motion to dismis s and reply \nmemorandum. (Rec. Doc. 28.)  \n2   Keegan adopts and incorporates by reference her opposition to Plaintiffs’ first motion for temporary \nrestraining order and preliminary injunction. (Rec. Doc. 57.) \n289292  8  \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 69    Filed 08/04/10   Page 9 of 33\nformula may be discriminatory 3 was flawed and unreliable. In addition, it is well settled such \ndicta at the preliminary injunctive stage are not the law of the case. Notwithstanding, the \nevidence provided herein shows the Road Home formula has no discriminatory effect.  Plaintiffs \ncannot succeed on the merits of their disparate impact claim.  \nIn addition, it has already been established the State of Louisiana has adequately set aside \nand reserved sufficient funds to pay  any remaining Road Home applicants  who are deemed \neligible.  Therefore, Plaintiffs are not at risk of any irreparable injury because, even if they are \nsuccessful on the merits , which is denied,  the LRA has obligated sufficient funds to  cover the \npayment of Road Home grant awards for eligibl e Road Home applicants who have not yet had \ntheir first closing.  Injunctive relief would only harm the remaining Road Home applicants and is \nnot in the public interest.  \nPlaintiffs’ second request for a temporary restraining order and preliminary relief remains \noverly broad, unnecessary and detrimental to the public interest and the administration of the \nRoad Home Program.  Their request should be denied. \nI.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n  Plaintiffs filed their Complaint in this case on November 12, 2008. (Rec. Doc.  1.)   \nDefendant filed a Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ lawsuit on May 5, 2009. (Rec. Doc. 28.)  \nAlthough Defendant’s motion to dismiss is potentially dispositive of all claims at issue in this \nlitigation, it remains pending as of the date of this motion.  O n June 2, 2010, Plaintiffs filed a \n                                                \n3   Keegan strongly disagrees with the Court’s dicta concerning the discriminatory impact of the formula. The \nRoad Home program was never about race; it was a state wide program designed to assist low to moderate income \nindividuals whose homes were damaged or destroyed by Hurricanes Katrina and/or Rita in  more than 37 Louisiana \nparishes. It was not designed solely for Orleans Parish. Nevertheless, there has never been a showing by any expert \nthe Road Home formula had a discriminatory impact. The only “evidence” submitted by Plaintiffs is based on \ninaccurate and flawed data. Notwithstanding, once the ACG was lifted, there is no possibility there could have been \na discriminatory impact, as Plaintiffs admit.  \n \n289292  9  \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 69    Filed 08/04/10   Page 10 of 33\nMotion for a Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction (“First Motion”).  (Rec. \nDoc. 50.)   Oral argument on Plaintiffs’ motion was heard June 25, 2010.   On June 29, 2010, this \nCourt denied Plaintiff’s motio n.  (Rec. Doc. 59.)   On July 6, 2010, the Court issued its \nMemorandum Opinion setting forth the reasons for the denial. (Rec. Doc. 61.)  The Court’s \ndenial of Plaintiff’s motion was  not limited to an Eleventh Amendment analysis, but included \nseveral grounds for denial, including, Plaintiffs’ failure to demonstrate a likelihood of success; \nthe Court’s lack of authority to grant the ultimate relief sought; the involvement of state versus \nfederal funds; Plaintiffs’ failure to show irreparable harm; likelihood  of third party injury, and \npublic interest weighing in favor of both parties.  \n  Thereafter, on July 21, 2010, Plaintiffs filed a Second Motion for Temporary Restraining \nOrder and Preliminary Injunction (“Second Motion”) seeking relief  identical to that so ught by \nvirtue of their first motion.  (Rec. Doc. 62.)  On July 22, 2010, Keegan filed a Motion for \nExtension of Time to Respond to Plaintiff’s Second Motion. (Rec. Doc. 63.)  On July 23, 2010, \nPlaintiffs also filed an Opposition to Keegan’s motion for add itional time. (Rec. Doc. 65.)   On \nJuly 23, 2010, the Court denied Keegan’s motion but provided an additional two days for \nKeegan to respond to Plaintiff’s First Motion. (Rec. Doc. 66.)4  On July 26, 2010, Plaintiffs filed \na Notice of Appeal appealing the  Court’s order denying their First Motion for preliminary \ninjunction. (Rec. Doc. 67.)   \nII.  THE COURT LACKS JURISDICTION TO ENTERTAIN PLAINTIFF’S \nSECOND MOTION & PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION IS BY COLLATERAL \nESTOPPEL \n \nUnder 28 U.S.C. § 1291, “all final decisions” of  the district court are appealable. This \nCircuit strictly construes this rule, noting “a district court's decision is ordinarily not final until it \n                                                \n4   Keegan’s response is timely filed in accordance with the Court’s Order.  \n289292  1 0 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 69    Filed 08/04/10   Page 11 of 33\n‘ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the \njudgment.’” Banks v. Office of Senate Sergeant -At-Arms and Doorkeeper of the United States \nSenate, 471 F.3d 1341, 1345 (D.C.Cir. 2006) (quoting In re Sealed Case (Medical Records), 381 \nF.3d 1205, 1209 (D.C.Cir. 2004)).  One exception to the final order rule is found in 28 U. S.C. § \n1292, which grants a court of appeals jurisdiction over certain interlocutory appeals. 28 U.S.C. § \n1292(a)-(b). Under § 1292(a)(1), courts of appeals have jurisdiction from orders granting or \notherwise relating to injunctions. 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1).5  \nIt is well-settled that the filing of a notice of appeal, including an interlocutory appeal, \nconfers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of control over those \naspects of the case involved in the appeal.  United States v.  DeFries, 129 F.3d 1293, 1302 \n(D.C.Cir. 1997) (quoting  Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co ., 459 U.S. 56, 58, 103 \nS.Ct. 400, 74 L.Ed.2d 225 (1982)(“a federal district court and a federal court of appeals should \nnot attempt to assert jurisdiction over a  case simultaneously”).  The reasons for the transfer of \njurisdiction are obvious; “divestiture of district court jurisdiction avoids the ‘confusion and waste \nof time that might flow from putting the same issues before two courts at the same time.’” \nDecatur Liquors, Inc., et al. v District of Columbia, et al , 2005 WL 607881 *2 (D.D.C. March \n16, 2005), citing,  In the Matter of Thorp,  655 F.2d 997, 998 (9 th Circ. 1981).  The only \nexceptions to this rule are when a party frivolously appeals or takes an interlo cutory appeal from \na non-appealable order -  neither of which is applicable in this case.  United States v. DeFries, \n129 F.3d. at 1302-03; McKesson HBOC, Inc. v. Islamic Republic of Iran , 315 F.Supp.2d 63, 66 \n                                                \n5   Additionally, under §  1292(b), a district court judge may certify that “an order ‘involves a controlling \nquestion of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion’ and further finds ‘that an \nimmediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ulti mate termination of the litigation.’ ”  Banks, 471 \nF.3d at 1345 (quoting 28 U.S.C. 1292(b)). If a party files an appeal upon such certification, “[t]hat application for an \nappeal hereunder shall not stay proceedings in the district court unless the district judge or the Court of Appeals or a \njudge thereof shall so order.” 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). No such certification has been issued in this case. Accordingly, \n§1292(b) is inapplicable.  \n \n289292  1 1 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 69    Filed 08/04/10   Page 12 of 33\n(D.D.C. 2004) (“[A] notice of appeal from an una ppealable order does not divest the district \ncourt of jurisdiction.”).   The district court does not regain jurisdiction over the issues on appeal \nuntil the court of appeals issues its mandate.  Johnson v. Bechtel Associates Professional Corp ., \n801 F.2d 412, 415 (D.C.Cir. 1986) (per curiam). 6 \nPlaintiff’s Second Motion claims to seek relief on behalf of Road Home applicants who \nhave not received their initial grant rewards under the Road Home Program. (Rec. Doc. 62, p. 8.)  \nPlaintiffs seek a temporary restra ining order and preliminary injunction enjoining Keegan from \nusing a formula that takes into account pre -storm home values to calculate and disburse any \nfuture grants. (Id. )  By Plaintiffs’ own admission, however, the individuals for whom Plaintiffs \nseek relief by virtue of their Second Motion were included in Plaintiffs’ First Motion. (See Rec. \nDoc. 65, p. 2.) (“African American homeowners who have not yet received initial awards under \nthe Road Home Program …have thus always been a part of this litigation  and a part of the class \nfor whom Plaintiffs sought relief in this litigation,  including in Plaintiffs’ first motion for \npreliminary relief.” )(emphasis added.)  Further, Plaintiffs admit their Second Motion \n“encompasses the same factual issues and largely  the same legal issues” as their First Motion. \n(Id.)   Although Plaintiffs contend their Second Motion “simply addresses a narrower subset of \nPlaintiffs,” it is undisputed this “subset” was included in their First Motion, which this Court \ndenied and for which Plaintiffs have filed a notice of appeal.  It is further undisputed Plaintiffs \ncounsel declined at oral argument to limit their First Motion and the requested injunctive relief to \nthis “narrow subset” for whom they now seek relief.   \n \n \n                                                \n6   While a district court may retain jurisdiction to modify an injunction,  Plaintiffs are not seeking a \nmodification of their injunctive relief. Fed.R.Civ.P. 62(c).  Rather, Plaintiffs are seeking the identical relief sought \nby way of their First Motion, which this Court denied and which Plaintiffs have now appealed.  \n289292  1 2 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 69    Filed 08/04/10   Page 13 of 33\nAs this Court noted in its Memorandum Opinion: \nThe Court asked plaintiffs during oral argument on this motion whether they \nwould wish to go forward with their request for a preliminary injunction if \nthe Court were to hold that the ultimate relief they seek is only availabl e to \nthose 179 individuals. Plaintiffs did not express a desire to limit their case to \nsuch a narrow group of Road Home Program beneficiaries.  \n \n*  *  * \nAs noted, plaintiffs’ counsel have declined to indicate that the wish to \nrepresent the 179 applicants who have not yet received awards.  \n \n(Rec. Doc. 65, pps. 14-15, fn. 12, 13.) 7 \nThis “narrow subset” of plaintiffs was included in Plaintiff’s First Motion.  It was the \nsubject of oral argument on Plaintiffs’ First Motion.   It was the subject of this Court’s \nMemorandum Opinion dated  July 6, 2010, denying Plaintiff’s First Motion.  Plaintiffs’ counsel \nwere provided the opportunity to seek relief on behalf of this narrow subset during oral argument \nJune 25, 2010.  They declined.  Their subsequent appeal of the Co urt’s Order denying their First \nMotion inherently includes an appeal of all issues before the Court by way of their First Motion.  \nSee Decatur Liquors, supra. at *3 (where party moved to dissolve a preliminary injunction but \nraised no new facts or argument  it was inadvisable for the court to reconsider its decision \nparticularly where the propriety of its initial determination is under review by an appeals court.)  \nAs this “narrow subset” was included in the First Motion, and Plaintiffs have now raised \nthe same factual and legal arguments in their Second Motion, any issues related to the denial \ninjunctive relief on this subset’s behalf is encompassed in Plaintiffs’ appeal.  Accordingly, this \nCourt is divested of jurisdiction to entertain Plaintiffs' Second Motion and their motion should be \nstayed pending the outcome of Plaintiffs’ appeal. \n                                                \n7   Keegan submits Plaintiffs’ lack standing to seek injunctive relief on behalf of this subset of individuals as \nPlaintiffs’ counsel unequivocally declined representing these individuals at oral argument.   \n289292  1 3 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 69    Filed 08/04/10   Page 14 of 33\nIn addition, Plaintiffs’ Second Motion is barred by collateral estoppel and/or res judicata. \nTraditionally, issues litigated in the context of a preliminary injunction tradit ionally would not \nform a basis for collateral estoppel.   Kuznich v. County of Santa Clara, 689 F.2d 1345, 1350-51 \n(9th Cir. 1983).  Recent decisions have relaxed this view by applying the collateral estoppel \ndoctrine to matters resolved by preliminary ruli ngs.” See  Barnhardt v. District of Columbia , \n2010 WL 2802646 (D.D.C. July 16, 2010) citing , In re Nangle, 274 F.3d 481, 484 -85 (8th Cir. \n2001).  The doctrine may apply,  where findings made in a prior proceeding are “sufficiently \nfirm” to remove any compell ing reason to permit re -litigation of the issues . Barnhardt at *9, \nciting, Hawksbill Sea Turtle v. FEMA, 126 F.3d 461, 474 n. 11 (3d Cir. 1997).  For purposes of \ncollateral estoppel, finality “may mean little more than that the litigation of a particular issue has \nreached such a stage that a court sees no really good reason for permitting it to be litigated \nagain.” Id, citing, In re Brown, 951 F.2d 564, 569 (3d Cir. 1991).  The issue of whether Plaintiffs \nare entitled to any injunctive relief has already been decided by this Court.  Because the subset of \napplicants for whom Plaintiffs now seek relief were included in their First Motion and therefore, \nwere included in the Court’s July 6, 2010, Memorandum, Plaintiffs’ requested relief is barred by \ncollateral estoppel.  Moreover, Plaintiffs have appealed the denial of their First Motion. (Rec. \nDoc. 67; District of Columbia Court of Appeals, Civil Action No. 10-5257).  Plaintiffs should be \nprecluded from re-litigating the very issues previously decided by this Court and issues presently \non appeal.  \nIII.  PLAINTIFFS LACK STANDING TO SEEK RELIEF ON BEHALF OF THE \nSUBSET \n \nArticle III of the Constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to cases or \ncontroversies. U.S. Const. Art. III, § 2, cl. 1.  “[A] showing  of standing is an essential and \nunchanging predicate to any exercise of a court's jurisdiction.”  Fla. Audubon Society v. Bentsen, \n289292  1 4 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 69    Filed 08/04/10   Page 15 of 33\n94 F.3d 658, 663 (D.C.Cir. 1996) (citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 \nS.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992)).  The “question of standing is whether the litigant is entitled \nto have the court decide the merits of the dispute or of particular issues.”  Allen v. Wright, 468 \nU.S. 737, 750-51, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984).  Therefore, standing must be resolved \nas threshold matter. Raytheon Co. v. Ashborn Agencies, Ltd., 372 F.3d 451, 453 (D.C.Cir. 2004).  \nTo demonstrate standing, a plaintiff must satisfy a three -pronged test.  Sierra Club v. \nEnvironmental Protection. Agency, 292 F.3d 895, 898 -99 (D.C.Cir. 2002) (citing Defenders of \nWildlife, 504 U.S. at 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130). First, the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact \nwhich is defined as a harm that is concrete and actual and/or imminent, not one that is \nconjectural or hypothetical.  Byrd v. En vironmental Protection Agency , 174 F.3d 239, 243 \n(D.C.Cir. 1999).  Second, there must be a fairly traceable connection between the alleged injury \nand the alleged conduct of the defendant.  Id.; Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Org.,  426 \nU.S. 26, 41, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976).   Finally, it must be likely that the requested \nrelief will redress the alleged injury.  Id.    \nIt is well settled that “[m]ere allegations will not support standing at the preliminary \ninjunction stage.” Doe v. Nat'l Bd. Med. Examiners, 199 F.3d 146, 152 (3rd Cir. 1999);  see also \nNat'l Wildlife Fed. v. Burford,  878 F.2d 422, 423 (D.C.Cir. 1989),  rev'd on other grounds sub \nnon Lujan, 497 U.S. 871, 110 S.Ct. 3177 (the burden of establishing standing at preliminary \ninjunction stage is no less than the standard for summary judgment).  No standing will exist if the \nallegations are “purely speculative, [which is] the ultimate label for injuries too implausible to \nsupport standing.” Tozzi v. Dep't of Health & Human Servs., 271 F.3d 301, 307 (D.C.Cir. 2001).  \nFurther, no standing will exist if the court is required to accept “very speculative inferences and \n289292  1 5 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 69    Filed 08/04/10   Page 16 of 33\nassumptions in any endeavor to connect the alleged injury with [the challenged conduct].” \nWinpisinger v. Watson, 628 F.2d 133, 139 (D.C.Cir. 1980). \nPlaintiffs cannot demonstrate an injury-in-fact for the subset of Road Home applicants for \nwhom they seek injunctive relief.  In fact, Plaintiffs’ claim of injury on behalf of this purported \nsubset is purely speculative.  As more detaile d below, there is only a  possibility that any of the \nremaining “179” applicants  (now numbering 141)  are even eligible to receive Road Home \ngrants due to various eligibility issues and an impending deadline. (See Section V, Exhibit B, \ninfra, identifying the eligibility issues faced by the remaining 141 applicants.)   In addition, \nbecause there is no injury in fact, Plaintiffs cannot establish a traceable connection between the \nalleged injury and the alleged conduct of Keegan.  The requested relief cannot r edress the \nsubset’s alleged injury as it is purely speculative as to whether an injury has been sustained. \nFinally, to the extent a number of the subset claims (38) have already been processed and \ngrants dispersed, Plaintiffs lack standing to seek redress  on their behalf, as first, they can show \nno injury has been suffered and second, the Court is without authority to order the recalculation \nof these grants.  \nAbsent this Court accepting Plaintiffs’ speculative inferences and unsupported \nassumptions concerning the Road Home formula and the subset’s alleged risk of imminent harm, \nPlaintiffs have failed to demonstrate standing on behalf of this subset of Road Home applicants \nfor whom they request injunctive relief.  Their request should be denied.  \nIV.   PLAINTIFFS’ SECOND REQUEST FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IS \nPREMATURE  \n \nAs of the date of this Opposition, the Court has not ruled on Keegan’s Motion to Dismiss \nfiled May 5, 2009, a motion potentially dispositive of all issues in this litigation.  Accordingly, \n289292  1 6 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 69    Filed 08/04/10   Page 17 of 33\nsimilar to Plaintiffs’ first request for injunctive relief, Keegan maintains their second request for \ninjunctive relief is premature. \nIt is well settled that  jurisdictional questions should be resolved before  considering the \nmerits of injunctive relief.  See Leitner v. U.S., 679 F.Supp.2d 37, 40 (D.D.C. 2010 ); In Re Any \nand All Funds or Other Assets in Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. , 601 F.Supp.2d 252, 253 \n(D.D.C. 2009); Bancoult v. McNamara, 227 F.Supp.2d 144  (D.D.C. 2002).  Therefore, prior to \ndeciding Plaintiff’s second motion, this Court should decide the threshold question of whether it \nhas jurisdiction over this litigation by ruling on the outstanding Motion to Dismiss.  Liberty Mut. \nIns. Co. v. Wetzel, 424 U.S. 737, 740, 96 S.Ct. 1202, 47 L.Ed.2d 435 (1976) ; Cobell v. Norton, \n240 F.3d 1081, 1094 (D.C. Cir. 2001) .  See 11A C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal \nPractice and Procedure § 2941, p. 35 (2d ed. 1995) (“[Rule 65] assumes the district court has \nalready acquired jurisdiction and that venue is proper.”)   Until such time as this Court rules on \nKeegan’s motion to dismiss,  Plaintiffs’ repeated requests for a temporary restraining order and \npreliminary injunction are premature and should be denied.  \nV.   PLAINTIFFS ARE NOT ENTITLED TO INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER FED. R. \nCIV.P. 65 \n \n  A.   Standard for Injunctive Relief \n \nPlaintiffs’ Second Motion, like their First Motion, fails to satisfy the requisite showing \nfor injunctive relief at this stage of the litigation.  I njunctions are extraordinary forms of judicial \nrelief which courts should grant sparingly. Mazurek v. Armstrong, 520 U.S. 968, 972, 117 S.Ct. \n1865, 138 L.Ed.2d 162 (1997) .  It is not a form of relief granted lightly.  Ambach v. Bell, 686 \nF.2d 974, 979 (D.C. Cir. 1982) .  Rather, only when the movant demonstrates (1)  a substantial \nlikelihood of success on the merits; (2) it would suffer irreparable injury if the  injunction is not \ngranted; (3) an injunction would not substantially injure other interested parties; and (4) the \n289292  1 7 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 69    Filed 08/04/10   Page 18 of 33\npublic interest would be furthered by the injunction should such relief be granted.  Mova Pharm. \nCorp. v. Shalala, 140 F.3d 1060, 1066 (D.C. C ir. 1998)(quoting CityFed Fin. Corp. v. Office of \nThrift Supervision, 58 F.3d 738, 746 (D.C. Cir. 1995) .8   These factors “interrelate on a sliding \nscale and must be balanced against each other.”  Serono Labs., Inc. v. Shalala , 158 F.3d 1313, \n1318 (D.C. Cir. 1998) .  Of significant importance in this analysis is the requirement for  the \nmovant to demonstrate a substantial likelihood of succ ess on the merits.  Cf. Benton v.

Absent a \n“substantial indication” of likely success on the merits, “there would be no justification for the \ncourt’s intrusion into the ordinary processes of administration and judicial review.”  Am.

Plaintiffs Cannot Prove A Substantial Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nThis Court has already found Plaintiffs  cannot prove a substantial likelihood of success \non the merits.  To support their claim of success on the merits, Plaintiffs rely solely on the \nCourt’s dicta in its Memorandum Opinion that the Road Home formula may ha ve a disparate \n                                                \n8   Certain types of preliminary injunctions are disfavored: (1) preliminary injunctions that alter the status quo; \n(2) mandatory preliminary injunctions; and, (3) preliminary injunctions that give the movant all the relief it would \nbe entitled to if it prevailed in a full trial.  O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao Do  Vegetal v. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d \n973, 975 (10th Cir. 2004), affirmed, 546 U.S. 418, 126 S.Ct. 1211, 163 L.Ed.2d 1017 (2006).  In these cases, a party \nseeking a preliminary injunction “must meet a higher standard than in the ordinary case by showing ‘clearly’ that he \nor she is entitled to relief or that ‘extreme or very serious damage’ will result from the denial of the injunction.”  \nVeitch v. Danzig, 135 F.Supp.2d 32, 35 (D.D.C. 2001).   \n9   Similar to their First Motion, Plaintiffs’ Second Motion does not seek to maintain the status quo, rather it is \ntailored to have the opposite effect.  The status quo would be to allow OCD to complete the Road Home Program to \nassist Louisiana homeowners  by completing the processing of the Road Home grant applications and appeals \nremaining, awarding and disbursing compensation grants, awarding and disbursing Additional Compensation Grants \n(ACG) in an amount over the original $50,000 cap pursuant to Action  Plan Amendment 39, and by proposing and \nseeking HUD approval for a construction loan program as described in Action Plan Amendment 43.  \nIt is clear from the overly broad wording of Plaintiffs’ proposed order, they are requesting a “freeze” all of  \nOCD’s functions at this time, thus putting an end to the flow of federal recovery money to the State of Louisiana by \nasking this Court to enjoin Keegan “from using the pre -storm value of a beneficiary’s home as a criterion to \ncalculate or disburse any further initial grant awards to beneficiaries of the Road Home Program, which Defendant \nadministers.” (Rec. Doc. 62-2.)  Plaintiffs should be required to meet the higher standard than in the ordinary case \nby showing they are ‘clearly’ entitled to relief and/or that ‘ extreme or very serious damage’ will result from the \ndenial of the injunction. \n289292  1 8 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 69    Filed 08/04/10   Page 19 of 33\nimpact.  However, this Court has not yet ruled on Keegan’s motion to dismiss or determined that \nthe Fair Housing Act even applies to Plaintiff’s claims. 10   Moreover, Plaintiffs have not proven \ntheir disparate impact claim with any competent evidence.  \nDisparate impact claims “involve. . . practices that are facially neutral in their treatment \nof different groups but that in fact fall more harshly on one group than another and cannot be \njustified by business necessity.”  Anderson v. Zubieta , 180 F.3d 329 (D.C. Cir. 1999) , citing \nInternational Bhd. Of Teamsters v. United States , 431 U.S. 324, 336 n. 15, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 52 \nL.Ed.2d 396 (1977).   This Court has identified four factors for determining whether conduct that \nproduces a disparate impact violates the FHA : (1) the strength of the plaintiffs’ showing of \ndiscriminatory effect; (2) whether any evidence indicates discriminatory intent; (3) the \ndefendant’s interest on taking the ch allenged actions; and, (4) whether the plaintiffs seek to \ncompel the defendant to affirmatively provide housing to a protected class or merely to restrain \nthe defendant from interfering with individual property owners who wish to provide such \nhousing. 2922 Sherman Avenue Tenants’ Association v. District of Columbia , 444 F.3d 673, 680 \n(D.C. Cir. 2006).  Once plaintiffs demonstrate that the challenged practice has a disproportionate \nimpact, the burden shifts to the defendant “to prove that its actions furthered, in theory and in \npractice, a legitimate, bona fide governmental intere st and that no alternative would serve that \ninterest with less discriminatory effect.”  Id.; see also, National Fair Housing Alliance, Inc. v. \nPrudential Insurance Company of America , 208 F.Supp.2d 46 (D.D.C. 2002) (“Courts have \napplied the basic burden -shifting scheme used to review disparate impact  clams brought under \n                                                \n10   Keegan renews her argument the Fair Housing Act does not supply Plaintiffs with a cognizable claim since \nthe Road Home Program at issue is a compensation grant program, rathe r than a housing program, and Keegan did \nnot “make unavailable or deny . . . a dwelling to any person because of race,”  “discriminate against any person in \nthe terms, conditions or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of service s or facilities in \nconnection therewith, because of race,” participate in any “real estate-related transactions,” or  administer  “housing-\nrelated programs” as defined in the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3604(a) -(b) , 3605(a), 3608(d), 3608(e)(5). In \naddition, Plaintiffs have still not addressed their claims under the Housing and Community Development Act of \n1974, 42 U.S.C. § 5304(b)(2).      \n289292  1 9 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 69    Filed 08/04/10   Page 20 of 33\nTitle VII, 42 U.S.C. § 1973(c) , to disparate impact claims brought pursuant to FHA .”)  Under \nboth the four -factor and burden -shifting approaches,  this Court requires “proof of \ndisproportionate impact.”  2922 Sherman Avenue Tenants’ Association , 444 F.3d at 680 .  “To \nprevail on a disparate impact claim, a plaintiff must offer sufficient evidence to support a finding \nthat the challenged policy actually disproportionately affected a protected class.”  2922 Sherman \nAvenue Tenants’ Association, 444 F.3d at 681. \nTypically, a showing of disparate impact is made through the submission of statistical \nevidence by an expert that compares the relevant populations and the effect of the practice at \nissue. Menokan v.  Blair, 2006 WL 1102809, at *2 (D.D.C. April 26, 200 6). Disparate impact \ndiscrimination is proven by showing disparities in excess of 1.96 standard deviations under a \ntwo-tailed test of statistical significance. Anderson, 108 F.3d 329 at 339 -40.  In support of their \nSecond Motion, Plaintiffs failed to submit any real statistical evidence or the opinion of an expert \neconomist or statistician that indic ates the effect of the practice at issue (the formula used for \nOption 1 compensation grants) has a disparate impact on African American eligible homeowners \nin Orleans Parish as compared to Caucasian eligible homeowners in Orleans Parish. 11  Further, \nPlaintiffs have offered no admissible or reliable evidence the alleged disparities are in excess of \n1.96 standard deviations.  Without such reliable statistical proof, Plaintiffs are unable to show \nany likelihood on the success of the merits of this case.   \nThe Court’s dicta made in connection with Plaintiffs’ First Motion was not based upon a \ncomplete review of the merits of Plaintiffs’ disparate impact claim.12  Rather, the Court’s opinion \nwas based upon a flawed PolicyLink report which contained incomplete and o utdated data.   \nNotwithstanding, the Court’s dicta at the preliminary injunctive stage are  not binding and do not \n                                                \n11   Plaintiffs’ First Motion was likewise devoid of this type of statistical support.  \n12   Dicta is an opinion by a court on a question that is directly involved, briefed, and argued by counsel, and \neven passed on by the court, but that is not essential to the decision.

Camenisch,  451 U.S. 390, \n395, 101 S.Ct. 1830, 68 L.Ed.2d 175 (1981) (“[F]indings of fact and conclusions of law made by \na court granting a preliminary injunction are not binding at trial on the merits.”);  Nutrition Inst. \nv. Block, 749 F.2d 50, 56 (D.C.Cir. 1984) (“[A] tentative assessment made to support the \nissuance of a preli minary  injunction pending resolution of the issue ... is not even law of the \ncase, much less res judicata in other litigation”). As of the date of Plaintiffs’ Second Motion, \nthere is no competent evidence supporting this Court’s “finding” the Road Home fo rmula may \nhave a disparate impact.  To the contrary, the evidence shows no disparate impact.  \n1.  Plaintiffs’ Evidence is Flawed \nTo support their First Motion, Plaintiffs relied on a 2008 report prepared by PolicyLink to \nprove disparate impact discriminatio n.   In their Second Motion, Plaintiffs continue to rely on \nconclusions from the PolicyLink report, using the Court’s dicta based on the report, to support \ntheir claim the remaining 179 Road Home applicants are of risk of being discriminated against \nabsent injunctive relief.   However, as demonstrated herein, t he PolicyLink is flawed in several \naspects and it does not provide any direct comparisons of the outcomes for African -Americans \nand Caucasians who are in the higher income group,  nor anything specific to the 179 African -\nAmerican homeowners who may be awarded an Option 1 grant , but who have not yet received \nany funds from the Road Home Program.   \nPrimarily, the PolicyLink report is based on incomplete data. (See Exhibit A, Declaration \nof Janet R. Thornton, Ph.D.)  The PolicyLink Report is based on data for Option 1 Road Home \n                                                \n13   None of the cases cited by Plaintiffs involve a challenge to findings made during preliminary injunctive \nproceedings. Kimberline v. Quinlan, 199 F.3d 496 (D.C.Cir. 1999)(law of the case doctrine addressed during §1983 \naction and appeal of denial of summary judgment);  Does I through III v. District of Columbia,  593 F.Supp.2d 115 \n(D.D.C. 2009)(when a case is appealed and remanded the decision of the Court of Appeals establishes the law of the \ncase which the trial court must follow on remand).  \n \n289292  2 1 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 69    Filed 08/04/10   Page 22 of 33\napplicants who received a monetary grant as of June 26, 2008 , and whose transactions  were \nrecorded in the database upon which the authors relied.  (Exhibit A, ¶ 7.)   The report  shows, \nstatewide14, the number of closed applications was 84,114 as of  June 26, 2008.  (Id.)  As of July \n15, 2010, however, there were  117,298 applicants  who received Road Home Program  grants \nunder Option 1.   (Id.) The PolicyLink  Report failed to include  approxim ately 30% of the \nLouisiana grants that have now been awarded. (Id.)   \nAs of June 26, 2008, the number of New Orleans closed applications was 31,347. This is \nonly 58.1% of the total number of applications  citywide. (Exhibit A, ¶ 8.)   The percent of New \nOrleans applications that closed by June 26, 2008 varied by neighborhood . (Id.)  The Lower 9th \nWard had the lowest percentage closed  at 53.9% and Gentilly had the highest percentage closed \nat 66.6%.  (Id.)  Given that nearly 42% of the New Orleans application s are not included in the \nPolicyLink Report and nearly 30% of all closed applications  were not included, the PolicyLink \nReport is not reliable to assess any validity to  Plaintiffs’ allegation of race discrimination in the \ndistribution of Road Home Option 1 grants to Orleans Parish homeowners.  (Id.)   \nIn addition, the PolicyLink Report does not even focus on the group of homeowners who \nare the focus of Plaintiffs’ claim. Rather, it  is primarily based on grants awarded to homeowners \nin all income categories and is not restricted to those in the higher income category  (i.e., above \nLMI).  (Exhibit A, ¶ 9.)  As a result, the 2008 report does not provide any information that can be \nused to determine whether African -American recipients  in the higher income catego ry, those \npersons for whom  Plaintiffs now seek  relief, were adversely impacted by the way in which the \nLRA distributed Option 1 funds. (Id.)  \n                                                \n14   The Road Home program was designed as a state-wide program for thirty-seven parishes. It is not designed \nsolely for Orleans Parish.  \n289292  2 2 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 69    Filed 08/04/10   Page 23 of 33\nSecondly, the PolicyLink report understates the value of the grants some homeowners \nactually received as of mid-2010. (Exhibit A, ¶ 10.)  In 2009, the LRA amended the formula and \nremoved the $50,000 cap on the Additional Compensation Grants (ACGs) for LMI homeowners.  \n(Id.)  Effective January 2010,  applicants in this income bracket  became eligible for  additional \ngrant awards up to the estimated cost of damage or up to the  maximum grant of $150,000, even \nif the applicant did not possess flood and/or hazard insurance.  (Id.)  These extra funds likely \neliminated any gap between the estimated cost of repairing/rebuilding an d the total resources \navailable for such purposes for those whose income was at or below 80% of the area median \nincome.  (Id.)  Notably, Plaintiffs concede that LMI homeowners became entitled to grants based \non the full cost of repair (up to $150,000).15   \nAs of July 2010, 42% of the Option 1 closed applications were from LMI households \nand, across all closings, 41% were African -American.  (Exhibit A, ¶ 11.)  Given that in Orleans \nParish there is generally a strong correlation between LMI status and being Af rican-American, a \nlarge portion of the African -American grant recipients are likely  LMI households.  (Id.) For \nexample, in 2010, among the Orleans Parish Census Tracts severely impacted by Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita, approximately 82% of the families in the LMI category are African-American.  \n(Id.)  Considering this data, a large portion of the African -American recipients included in the \nPolicyLink Report are  not likely to be part of the subset of recipients on which Plaintiffs have \nnow focused their claim.  (Id.)  Further, a substantially larger percentage of African -Americans \nthan Caucasians in the Orleans Parish neighborhoods that suffered the greatest storm damage are \nin the LMI category.  (Id.)  Therefore, the removal of the cap on ACGs likely  reduced or may \nhave eliminated any potential adverse impact on African-American recipients as a group. (Id.)  \n                                                \n15 See Rec. Doc. 50, p. 17, fn. 9; Rec. Doc. 58,  pps. 2-3 (Plaintiffs’ admit the removal of the cap on ACGs \neliminated any potential adverse impact on African -Americans whose income is 80% or less of the area median \nincome.)  \n289292  2 3 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 69    Filed 08/04/10   Page 24 of 33\nFurther, the PolicyLink report does not provide any information that can be used to the \nevaluate Plaintiffs’ claim of adverse impact on the subset  of ind ividuals at issue. (Exhibit A, ¶ \n12.)  The PolicyLink Report includes no statistical analysis of differences between the African -\nAmerican and  Caucasian gaps among  higher income homeowners  – the  category on which \nPlaintiffs now focus.   (Id.) The PolicyLink  Report shows the gap between the total resources \navailable and the estimated cost of damage for LMI and higher income homeowners, as well as \nthe gaps for select neighborhoods in Orleans Parish.   (Id.)  These June 2008 calculations reveal \nthat, on average, the gap is larger among LMI than higher income homeowners, and is larger for \nhomeowners in predominately African -American neighborhoods than predominately Caucasian \nneighborhoods.  (Id.)  If the PolicyLink  Report included the ACGs and the  additional ACGs \n(“AACG”) that these LMI homeowners received, the gaps shown for the LMI group, African -\nAmericans and predominately African -American low income neighborhoods , would be \nsubstantially smaller than the report suggests. (Id.)  \nThirdly, even if the PolicyLink report had included complete data, the gaps between total \nresources to finance rebuilding and the estimated cost of repairs are likely inaccurate because the \ndamage estimates are not based on actual repair cost.  (Exhibit A, ¶ 13.)  According to The Road \nHome’s Frequent Questions for Homeowners, the estimated cost of damage is based on modest \nrebuilding standards.  If the dwelling sustained less than 51% damage, the cost was estimated on \na component-by-component basis.  If the  home was torn down or sustained m ore than 51% \ndamage, the estimated cost of repair was calculated by multiplying $130 by the total number of \nsquare feet in the home plus other costs.  Therefore, the gaps for homeowners whose actual costs \nof repair were  higher than the modest estimates are  understated.   (Id.)  If higher income and \nCaucasian homeowners were more likely to have actual repair costs in excess of their estimated \n289292  2 4 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 69    Filed 08/04/10   Page 25 of 33\ndamage, then  the  PolicyLink comparisons of  the  gaps between income or racial groups \nexaggerate the disparity, if any existed.  (Id.)  \nFinally, in order to determine whether African -American recipients as a group were \nadversely impact ed by the LRA’s distribution of Option 1 grants, an inferential statistical \nanalysis must be conducted.    (Exhibit A, ¶ 14.)   In this case, the analysis should compare the \nproportion of non-LMI African-American and Caucasian recipients whose grants were based on \nthe pre-storm value of the home.  (Id.)  If these proportions are statistically similar, then the data \nindicate that the policy is neu tral with respect to the race of these homeowners. (Id.)  If the \nproportions are not statistically similar, then the analyst can determine if the gap between \nAfrican-American and Caucasian recipients is statistically significant.   (Exhibit A, ¶ 15.)   The \ncalculation of the gap should account for  insurance payments and FEMA grants as well as the \npenalty for the lack of insurance. (Id.)  The results of such an analysis can be used to determine \nwhether the high income  African-Americans were adversely impacted  by the formula that LRA \nused to distribute Option 1 grants to applicants with income above the LMI threshold.  (Id.)  \nThe PolicyLink report relied upon by Plaintiffs is unequivocally incomplete, outdated, \nand fails to include the additional compensation gr ants to low/moderate income recipients.  The \nreport is devoid of any reliable information to evaluate whether the formula utilized by the LRA \nhas an adverse impact on the African -American Option 1 recipients or 179 potential recipients \nwith income levels a bove the low/moderate income threshold.   (Exhibit A, ¶ 16.)   The report \nshould be disregarded in its entirety.  \n2.  Sovereign Immunity Concerns Exists \nThe Court did not deny Plaintiff’s First Motion solely because of sovereign immunity \nconcerns.  Several gr ounds formed the basis of the denial: Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a \n289292  2 5 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 69    Filed 08/04/10   Page 26 of 33\nlikelihood of success; the Court’s lacked authority to grant the ultimate relief sought by \nPlaintiffs; state funds, not federal funds were involved; Plaintiffs failed to show irreparable harm; \nthere was a likelihood of third party injury, and public interest weighed in favor of both parties. \n(Rec. Doc. 61).  Plaintiffs’ Second Motion should not change this Court’s analysis, as Plaintiffs \ncontinue to fail to meet the requisite showing j ustifying injunctive relief at this stage of the \nlitigation. \nNotably, Plaintiffs attempt to circumvent sovereign immunity concerns by citing the \nCourt’s suggestion it “would” have jurisdiction to enjoin Keegan from continuing to administer \nthe Road Home Program in an unlawful manner.  However, as demonstrated above, the Court’s \ndicta the formula at issue may be discriminatory was based on incomplete, outdated and flawed \ndata.  \nIn addition, sovereign immunity concerns remain viable, even for the “179” remain ing \napplicants for whom Plaintiffs seek relief.  Of the original 179 applicants, as of July 31, 2010, an \nadditional 38 applicants have received grants. (Exhibit B, Declaration of Lara Robertson.) Their \ngrants have been calculated and dispersed. Accordingly , any relief ordered by this Court for \nthose applicants would be retroactive and impermissible. \n  Therefore, while Keegan opposes any injunctive relief concerning the “179” applicants, \nas the funds involved are state, not federal funds, by no means can this  Court order retroactive \nrelief for any applicants, including, the 38 applicants identified above, whose grants have already \nbeen calculated and/or dispersed.16  \n3.  There is no Risk of Irreparable Harm \n“[T]he basis of injunctive relief in the federal courts ha s always been irreparable harm,” \nSampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 88, 94 S.Ct. 937, 39 L.Ed.2d 166 (1974).  A court may deny a \n                                                \n16   See Rec. Doc. 52. \n289292  2 6 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 69    Filed 08/04/10   Page 27 of 33\nmotion for a preliminary injunction and not address the remaining three factors where a plaintiff \nfails to establish irreparable harm.  CityFed Fin. Corp. v. Office of Thrift Supervision , 58 F.3d \n738, 747 (D.C.Cir.1995).  To be irreparable, an injury must be “certain and great,” “actual and \nnot theoretical,” and “of such imminence that there is a clear and present need for equitable relief \nto prevent irreparable harm.” Id.   A mere showing of “possible” injury is insufficient.  Winter v. \nNat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., --- U.S. ----, 129 S.Ct. 365, 375, 172 L.Ed.2d 249 (2008) (a plaintiff \nmust “demonstrate that irreparable injury is like ly in the absence of an injunction,” and not a \nmere “possibility”);   Wisconsin Gas Co. v. FERC,  758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C.Cir. 1985) (per \ncuriam) (irreparable harm is shown only where a plaintiff's injury is “both certain and great” \nrather than “theoretical”).  \nThe purported “narrow subset” of Road Home applicants for whom Plaintiffs seek relief \ndo not face irreparable harm as there is only a mere  possibility any of these applicants will ever \nmeet eligibility requirements and/or receive Road Home grants.   Of  t he remaining 141 \napplicants, 2 applicants are no longer eligible to receive a Road Home grant because they failed \nto meet the program deadline of November 1, 2008. (Exhibit B, ¶5(a).)   Fifty -four (54) \napplicants have failed to maintain communications with  the program staff and it is unknown \nwhether they have a continued interest in receiving a Road Home grant.  (Exhibit B, ¶5(c).)  \nSixty-nine (69) applicants face eligibility issues relating to documentation evidencing their \nownership of the property. (Exhib it B, ¶5(d).)  Thirteen (13) applicants face eligibility issues \nrelating to documentation evidencing their occupancy of the property. (Exhibit B, ¶5(e).)  \nAnother three (3) applicants have other eligibility issues relating to either ownership and/or \noccupancy issues.  (Exhibit B, ¶5(b).)   \n289292  2 7 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 69    Filed 08/04/10   Page 28 of 33\nThe Office of Community Development has established a deadline of August 16, 2010 by \nwhich applicants must contact the program staff and provide missing documentation and \nschedule a closing date, which must occur prior to  October 1, 2010. (Exhibit B, ¶5.)  It is \nanticipated that a substantial portion of the remaining applicants will no longer be eligible for a \nRoad Home grant once the August 16, 2010 deadline passes.  (Id.) \nIn addition, it is undisputed there are sufficien t funds in reserve and set -aside to pay any \neligible pending grant applications.  Primarily, and contrary to the position taken by the Plaintiffs \nin their Second Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction, no \n“surplus” of monies exis t from which this Court can take funds to disperse to the “subset” of \napplicants identified by the Plaintiffs, i.e., those individuals who comprise the approximate 141 \npending Road Home applications of identified African American homeowners in Orleans Pari sh \nwho opted for Option 1 and are above low-to-moderate levels of income. (Exhibit C, Declaration \nof Robin Keegan.) \nThe remaining funding of the various types of grants under the Road Home program and \nthe expenses associated with administration and complet ion of the program is through an \nappropriation from the U.S. Congress under Public Law 110 -116.  (Exhibit C, ¶ 6.)  Following \nbudgeted amounts for payment of homeowner compensation grants, additional compensation \ngrants, elevation incentive grants, “sold  h ome” grants, payment of costs associated with \nrehabilitation of acquired properties, administrative expenses of the Louisiana Land Trust, \namong others, there remains from that appropriation approximately  $150 million  which is \nrestricted by law for use in the Road Home program.  (Id.)  As there continue to be a number of \nRoad Home grant recipients that, due to a variety of reasons, have unmet needs which have \nprevented them from completing recovery from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, to further assist \n289292  2 8 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 69    Filed 08/04/10   Page 29 of 33\nsuch Road Home grant recipients the State has prepared Action Plan Amendment 43 (APA43), \nwhich was submitted to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development on \nJuly 1, 2010.  (Id.) Through APA43, the remaining funds of the appropriation under PL11 0-116 \nshall be utilized in construction lending programs. (Id.) This proposed activity would be \ncombined with other programs that the OCD has developed to support Option 1 families to \nrebuild their homes. (Id.)  \nNotwithstanding, as this Court has already f ound, Plaintiffs’ allegations of  irreparable \ninjury are a crisis of their own making as they waited more than 4 years to bring their motion.  A  \nparty cannot claim irreparable harm if the “injury is of their own making.”  See Carollo v. \nHerman, 84 F.Supp.2d 374, 378-79 (E.D.N.Y. 2000); Citibank , N.A. v.

As of \nNovember 12, 2008, there were 119,647 applications with funding disbursed and $7.3 billions \ndollars total funding disbursed.   However, Plaintiffs waited more than 20 months to fil e this \nmotion on behalf of an alleged “narrow subset” of individuals  – persons they declined to \nrepresent at the hearing on their first motion.   (Rec. Doc. 50.)    Plaintiffs have never explained \nthe reasons for this unreasonable delay.   Such delay justifies the denial of Plaintiffs’ request for \npreliminary injunction.17   \n                                                \n17   See Majorica,, S.A. v. R.H.

There is no evidence the formula has a disparate impact; as such, there is no evidence the \nremaining applicants face a risk of irreparable harm.

Injunctive Relief  Would Injure Other Interested Parties and Would Not \nFurther the Public Interest \n \n  Keegan has provided overwhelming evidence showing no disparate impact in the use of \nthe Road Home formula. She has provided  overwhelming evidence refuting any risk of \nirreparable harm.  Similarly, there is no justification for injunctive relief as the final two factors, \nharm to other interested parties and public interest, weigh against Plaintiffs.  Stopping the flow \nof the Road Home Program in its final stages, after nearly five years of operation, during which \ntime these Plaintiffs took no action whatsoever, would injure those remaining parties awaiting \nreceipt of their grants.  In addition, public interest in  Louisiana favors completing the Road \nHome grant process.  It does not favor a cessation of operations or a  complete overhaul of the \nprogram in the final stages, particularly, when there is no evidence of disparate impact and \nPlaintiffs’ request for relief is supported o nly by a PolicyLink report comprised of outdated and \nincomplete data. \n                                                                                                                                                       \nundermined the plaintiffs’ claim of irreparable harm); Commer v.

The relief Plaintiffs seek must be denied.  \nVI.

      "text": "Case 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 72    Filed 08/16/10   Page 1 of 6\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\nGREATER NEW ORLEANS FAIR\nHOUSING ACTION CENTER, et al.\nPlaintiffs,\nv. \nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF\nHOUSING AND URBAN Civil Action 08-01938  (HHK)\nDEVELOPMENT\nand\nROBIN KEEGAN, Executive Director of\nthe Louisiana Recovery Authority,\nDefendants. \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\nBefore the Court are plaintiffs’ “Second Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and\nPreliminary Injunction” [#62] and the “Motion to Stay Proceedings Pending Appeal” of\ndefendant Robin Keegan, Executive Director of the Louisiana Recovery Authority [#70].  Upon\nconsideration of the motions, the oppositions thereto, and the record of this case, the Court\nconcludes that Keegan’s motion should be denied and plaintiffs’ motion should be granted.  \nI\nThe background of this case is set out in the Court’s memorandum opinion explaining the\nreasons for its denial of plaintiffs’ first motion for a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) and\npreliminary injunction.  See Greater New Orleans Fair Hous. Action Ctr. v. U.S. Dep’t of Hous.\nand Urban Dev., — F. Supp. 2d —, 2010 WL 2718164, at *1-2 (July 6, 2010).  The Court will\nnot repeat that background here except to briefly summarize that Keegan’s agency is tasked with\ndistributing funds appropriated by Congress to individuals whose homes were damaged by\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 72    Filed 08/16/10   Page 2 of 6\nHurricanes Rita and Katrina.  Plaintiffs assert that the formula by which she does so under a\nportion of the program called Option 1 has a discriminatory impact on African-American\nhomeowners in New Orleans, in violation of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq. \nAfter the Court denied plaintiffs’ motion for a TRO and preliminary injunction, plaintiffs filed an\ninterlocutory appeal to the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.  That appeal is pending.  On\nJuly 21, 2010, plaintiffs filed a second motion for a TRO, seeking to enjoin Keegan from\ndisbursing initial Road Home Program awards to Option 1 applicants using a formula that takes\ninto account the pre-storm value of an individual’s home.  Keegan opposes this motion and also\nseeks a stay of this case pending appellate review.\nII\nA. Motion to Stay\nThe Court first addresses Keegan’s motion to stay.  Keegan seeks a stay because, she\nasserts, the issues raised in plaintiffs’ second motion for a TRO are identical to those now before\nthe D.C. Circuit on appeal.  The Court disagrees.  Although the two motions are closely related,\nthe second motion seeks different relief than did the first.  Accordingly, the D.C. Circuit will\nreview the Court’s resolution of whether the broad relief plaintiffs initially sought was warranted;\nthe Court here addresses whether the narrow relief they seek now is appropriate.  Therefore, the\nCourt will not stay this case.\nB. Second Motion for a TRO and Preliminary Injunction\nThis court may issue a preliminary injunction only when the movant demonstrates: (1) “a\nsubstantial likelihood of success on the merits”; (2) “that it would suffer irreparable injury if the\ninjunction is not granted”; (3) “that an injunction would not substantially injure other interested\n2\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 72    Filed 08/16/10   Page 3 of 6\nparties”; and (4) “that the public interest would be furthered by the injunction.”  Mova Pharm.\nCorp. v. Shalala, 140 F.3d 1060, 1066 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (quoting CityFed Fin. Corp. v. Office of\nThrift Supervision, 58 F.3d 738, 746 (D.C. Cir. 1995)).  “These factors interrelate on a sliding\nscale and must be balanced against each other.”  Serono Labs., Inc. v. Shalala, 158 F.3d 1313,\n1318 (D.C. Cir. 1998). \n1. Likelihood of Success on the Merits\nThe Court explained in its previous opinion that plaintiffs are likely able to make out a\nprima facie case that the formula used to calculate awards under Option 1 of the Road Home\nProgram violates the Fair Housing Act.  See Greater New Orleans, 2010 WL 2718164, at *3. \nNevertheless, the Court determined that plaintiffs did not have a likelihood of success on the\nmerits of their case because, under a line of cases expanding upon Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123\n(1908), the Court does not have jurisdiction to provide the retroactive relief—specifically,\ncorrection of awards already disbursed—plaintiffs ultimately sought.  See id. at *4-6.  Plaintiffs’\ncurrent motion, however, only seeks an injunction that would allow them ultimately to obtain the\nlimited relief the Court explained in a Clarification of an earlier order, issued June 4, 2010 [#52],\nit has jurisdiction to provide.  Specifically, they ask that Keegan be enjoined from disbursing\nfuture, initial Road Home Program awards under Option 1 based on a formula that takes into\naccount the pre-storm value of the applicant’s home.  In this way, plaintiffs seek to preserve the\nclaims of those individuals who have not yet received awards.  Keegan disputes the Court’s\ndetermination that plaintiffs have submitted evidence sufficient to show that they would likely be\nable to make out a prima facie case of racially discriminatory impact.  But the Court finds no\nreason to reconsider its ruling as to that issue, especially where Keegan has still provided neither\n3\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 72    Filed 08/16/10   Page 4 of 6\nevidence contradicting plaintiffs’ contentions nor an explanation of the reason for taking pre-\nstorm home values into account.  Because plaintiffs will likely be able to show after discovery\nthat the Option 1 formula is unlawful and in the absence of an impediment to success where\nplaintiffs ultimately seek only prospective relief, the Court concludes that plaintiffs have a\nlikelihood of prevailing on the merits of their Fair Housing Act claim as to Option 1 awards that\nhave not yet been distributed.\n2. Irreparable injury\nFor the reasons explained in this Court’s prior rulings and as referenced above, only\nindividuals who are entitled to but have not yet received initial Option 1 grants may bring suit on\nthe theories plaintiffs advance.  As Keegan continues to distribute awards, homeowners who\nreceive them lose their ability to challenge what plaintiffs allege is a racially discriminatory\nformula.  Accordingly, the Court finds that prospective Road Home Program recipients would\nface irreparable injury were it not to grant the injunction sought.\n3. Substantial injury to other parties\nThe Court acknowledges that granting plaintiffs’ motion may delay the distribution of\nawards to some homeowners, and for that reason, this factor weighs against doing so.  The Court\nnotes, however, that plaintiffs seek narrow relief—their proposed order specifically provides that\nKeegan “may continue to calculate and disburse grant awards in a manner that does not utilize\nthe pre-storm value of the beneficiary’s home as a criterion,” Pls.’ 2d Mot. for TRO, Proposed\nOrder at 1—so the injunction need not delay all Option 1 awards and will not interfere with the\nadministration of any other portion of the Road Home Program.\n4\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 72    Filed 08/16/10   Page 5 of 6\n4. Public interest\nAs noted in the Court’s previous opinion, it is in the public interest to remedy housing\ndiscrimination as well as to promptly disburse funds for the purpose of helping those severely\nharmed by hurricanes that occurred years ago.  This factor therefore does not weigh strongly on\nthe side of either party’s position.\n5. Conclusion\nHaving weighed the factors that must be considered when determining whether to grant\ninjunctive relief, the Court concludes that it is appropriate to grant the injunction plaintiffs seek\nhere.  Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their Fair Housing Act claim as to the\nOption 1 awards not yet disbursed, individuals who have not received awards will suffer\nirreparable injury to their ability to bring such claims if they receive awards based on the\nallegedly discriminatory formula, and neither the interests of third parties nor the public interest\noutweigh the reasons to grant the injunction.\nIII\nFor the foregoing reasons, it is this 16th day of August 2010, hereby\nORDERED that Keegan’s motion for a stay pending appellate review [#70] is DENIED;\nand it is further\nORDERED that plaintiffs’ motion for a second TRO and preliminary injunction [#62] is\nGRANTED.  Accordingly, Keegan, or any successor officer, is prohibited from disbursing any\naward under the Road Home Program using the pre-storm value of the home as a criterion for\ncalculating the amount of such award.  Under the terms of this order, Keegan may continue to\ncalculate and disburse Road Home Program funds in a manner that does not take into account the\n5\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 72    Filed 08/16/10   Page 6 of 6\npre-storm value of the recipient’s home.  This injunction shall remain in effect until the Court\nissues a decision on the merits or orders otherwise.\nHenry H. Kennedy, Jr.\nUnited States District Judge\n6",

This\n1 Plaintiffs seek to certify of a class of individual homeowners but, in accordance\nwith a deadline set in an order proposed by the parties and entered by the Court on February 9,\n2009, they have not yet filed for class certification.\n2 At the times plaintiffs filed their complaint and the state official filed the motion\nto dismiss resolved herein, Paul Rainwater was the Executive Director of the LRA.  Pursuant to\nRule 25(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, his replacement, Robin Keegan, became the\nnamed defendant when she took on Rainwater’s title.  Since that time, the LRA has ceased to\nexist, and Keegan has become the Executive Director of the Louisiana Office of Community\nDevelopment (“OCD”), the LRA’s successor agency.  No party has moved to correct the caption\nto reflect this change.

Plaintiffs seek an injunction requiring recalculation of Program awards to homeowners\nin New Orleans using a formula that does not have a disparate impact on African Americans. \nBefore the Court is Keegan’s motion to dismiss and for a transfer of venue [#28].  Upon\nconsideration of the motion, the opposition thereto, and the record of this case, the Court\nconcludes that the motion to dismiss should be granted in part and denied in part and the motion\nto transfer should be denied.\nI. BACKGROUND\nA. Factual Background\nIn 2005, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita caused catastrophic damage to much of the Gulf\nCoast, including New Orleans, Louisiana.  In response, Congress created a block grant program\nto assist in recovery of the region, which it funded through three appropriations statutes.  See\nPub. L. No. 109-148, 119 Stat. 2680, 2779-81 (Dec. 30, 2005); Pub. L. No. 109-234, 120 Stat.\n418, 472-73 (June 15, 2006); Pub. L. No. 110-116, 121 Stat. 1295, 1343-44 (Nov. 13, 2007). \nPursuant to these statutes and HUD regulations, the State of Louisiana was to receive $13.4\nbillion.  See 121 Stat. at 1343-44 (authorizing spending $3 billion on supplemental grants to\nLouisiana); 71 Fed. Reg. 7666, 7666 (Feb. 13, 2006) (allocating $6.2 billion from the first\nappropriation to Louisiana); 71 Fed. Reg. 63,337, 63,338 (Oct. 30, 2006) (allocating $4.2 billion\nfrom the second appropriation to Louisiana).  \n2\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 77    Filed 09/07/10   Page 3 of 21\nLouisiana designated approximately $11 billion of those funds for the Road Home\nProgram.  The LRA, in consultation with HUD, developed the Road Home program; HUD\napproved it and disburses the money Congress has appropriated for it to the LRA; and the LRA\nadministers it.  Under a portion of the Program called Option 1, an individual whose house was\ndamaged by the hurricanes may choose to receive a grant to repair or rebuild her home.3  Each\nbeneficiary of an Option 1 grant receives an award in the amount of either the value of her home\nbefore the storms or the cost of repairing her home, whichever is less, but not in excess of\n$150,000.  Since plaintiffs initiated their suit, the LRA has created Additional Compensation\nGrants (“ACGs”), supplemental awards available to Option 1 beneficiaries whose incomes are at\nor below eighty percent of the median in their areas.  Regardless of the pre-storm values of their\nhomes, these individuals may receive ACGs such that their total awards from the Road Home\nProgram reach the cost of repairs to their homes, still subject to the $150,000 cap.\nSince the Road Home Program’s inception, the LRA has distributed Option 1 awards to\ntens of thousands of homeowners.  At this time, a relatively small number of Option 1 applicants\nhave yet to receive their awards.\nIndividual plaintiffs Gloria Burns, Rhonda Dents, Almarie Ford, Daphne Jones, and\nEdward Randolph are African Americans who own homes in New Orleans that were severely\ndamaged by Hurricane Katrina, and subsequent flooding, in 2005.4  Each applied for a Road\n3 The Program also permits homeowners to instead opt to receive smaller grants to\nobtain housing elsewhere in Louisiana or outside the state.  The design and implementation of\nthose aspects of the Program are not at issue here.\n4 The other plaintiffs, Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center and the\nNational Fair Housing Alliance, non-profit organizations based in Louisiana and Washington,\nD.C., respectively, are advocacy groups that, inter alia, oppose housing discrimination.  \n3\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 77    Filed 09/07/10   Page 4 of 21\nHome Program grant under Option 1, and each received an award based on the pre-storm value\nof her or his home rather than the cost of repairing that home.  Since receiving their initial grants,\nBurns and Jones have been deemed eligible to receive ACGs such that their total awards will\namount to $150,000. \nB. Procedural History\nPlaintiffs initiated this action in November 2008.  In their complaint, they allege that the\nreliance on home values in calculating Option 1 awards “has a discriminatory disparate impact on\nAfrican Americans living in historically segregated communities.”  Compl. ¶ 52.  Specifically,\nthey argue that because “African American homeowners in New Orleans are more likely than\nwhite homeowners in New Orleans to own homes with lower values,” African-American\nrecipients of Option 1 grants are more likely than white recipients to receive only the amount of\nthe pre-storm value of their homes.  Compl. ¶¶ 54-57.  Consequently, plaintiffs allege, African-\nAmerican homeowners are likely to have a larger gap than white recipients between the amount\nof their awards and the cost of rebuilding.  Id. \nPlaintiffs assert that the discriminatory effects of the Option 1 formula violate the FHA\nand the HCDA.  Specifically, Count I of their complaint alleges that defendants have (1) “made\nunavailable or denied housing to African American homeowners because of their race in\nviolation of” section 3604(a) of the FHA; (2) “discriminated against African Americans because\nof their race in the availability of, and in the terms of conditions of, real estate-related\ntransactions in violation of” section 3605(a) of the FHA; (3) “failed to administer housing-related\nprograms and activities in a manner that affirmatively furthers fair housing, in violation of”\nsections 3608(d) and 3608(e)(5) of the FHA.  Compl. ¶¶ 74-76.  Count II alleges that defendants\n4\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 77    Filed 09/07/10   Page 5 of 21\n“failed to administer the Community Development Block Grant Program in a manner that\naffirmatively furthers fair housing, in violation of Title I of [the HCDA], 42 U.S.C. §\n5304(b)(2).”  Id. ¶ 77.  Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, “including but not limited to ordering\nDefendants to cease immediately their violation of Plaintiffs’ rights, and to remedy the invidious\neffects of their violations by recalculating Road Home homeowner grants in a nondiscriminatory\nmanner.”  Compl. at 17.\nKeegan and HUD both filed motions to dismiss this case.5  On May 24, 2010, the Court\nissued an order scheduling a hearing on those motions [#45], indicating that the parties should\naddress legal and factual issues regarding the application of Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123\n(1908), to this case; in particular, the Court was concerned—as explained in some detail in a\nClarification filed on June 4, 2010 [#52]—that the plaintiffs sought, in large part, retroactive\nrelief that would impermissibly call on this Court to order payment from the state treasury.  In\nresponse, plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) and preliminary\ninjunction.  They sought to have Keegan enjoined from spending any surplus funds—that is,\nProgram funds not already designated for any specific use—until the merits of their case were\nresolved.  The Court denied the motion largely for the reasons explained in the Clarification, see\nGreater New Orleans Fair Hous. Action Ctr. v. U.S. Dep’t of Hous. & Urban Dev., — F. Supp.\n2d —, 2010 WL 2718164 (July 6, 2010), which are also relevant to the resolution of Keegan’s\nmotion to dismiss.  Plaintiffs then filed a second motion for a TRO and preliminary injunction,\nwhich sought only to enjoin Keegan from disbursing initial Road Home Program awards to\n5 This opinion addresses only Keegan’s motion to dismiss.  The Court will issue a\nseparate opinion resolving the distinct legal issues raised in HUD’s motion.\n5\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 77    Filed 09/07/10   Page 6 of 21\nOption 1 applicants using a formula that takes into account the pre-storm value of an individual’s\nhome.  The Court granted that motion.  See Greater New Orleans Fair Hous. Action Ctr. v. U.S.\nDep’t of Hous. & Urban Dev., — F. Supp. 2d —, 2010 WL 3221968 (August 16, 2010).  Both of\nthe Court’s opinions are currently on appeal to the D.C. Circuit.\nAlthough the Court addressed in its opinions some of the issues crucial to ruling on\nKeegan’s motion to dismiss, it has not resolved all of the issues Keegan raises nor has it ruled on\nKeegan’s motion to transfer.  It now turns to these motions.\nII. ANALYSIS\nA. Motion to Dismiss\nKeegan seeks dismissal of plaintiffs’ claims as against her on the ground that the\nEleventh Amendment bars them.  In the alternative, she argues that the complaint fails to state a\nclaim on which relief can be granted as to Count I, the FHA claims and may not be brought by a\nprivate plaintiff as to Count II, the HCDA claim.  The Court concludes that some of these\narguments have merit but others do not.\n1. Sovereign immunity bars part of plaintiffs’ suit against Keegan.\nKeegan argues that plaintiffs’ claims against her are barred by sovereign immunity.6  She\nasserts that the exception to the Eleventh Amendment created by Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123\n(1908), does not apply because (1) the LRA, not Keegan as its Executive Director, is responsible\nfor the challenged provisions of the Road Home Program, and furthermore the LRA must obtain\nthe approval of several other entities in order to take action; (2) plaintiffs seek retrospective\n6 This portion of Keegan’s motion is based on Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure, which provides for dismissal based on lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.  Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 12(b)(1).\n6\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 77    Filed 09/07/10   Page 7 of 21\nrelief; and (3) this case implicates “special sovereign interests” and therefore is barred according\nto the reasoning of Idaho v. Coeur d’Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U.S. 261 (1997).7\nPlaintiffs respond that the Eleventh Amendment does not bar their claims.  They argue\nthat the Ex parte Young exception to sovereign immunity applies because (1) that the suit is\neffectively against the state does not bar it; (2) the relief plaintiffs seek is prospective and would\nrequire the expenditure of only federal, not state, funds; and (3) the principles articulated in\nCoeur d’Alene are inapplicable here.\nThe Court addresses each argument in turn but first describes the well established\nunderlying legal principles.  The Eleventh Amendment8 bars suits against states absent a state’s\nconsent to be sued.  See Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 276 (1986).9  But Ex parte Young held\nthat “[a] federal court is not barred by the Eleventh Amendment from enjoining state officers\nfrom acting unconstitutionally, either because their action is alleged to violate the Constitution\ndirectly or because it is contrary to a federal statute or regulation that is the supreme law of the\nland.”  Vann v. Kempthorne, 534 F.3d 741, 749 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (quoting CHARLES ALAN\n7 Keegan also asserts that plaintiffs’ “fail[ure] to address the issue of sovereign\nimmunity in their Complaint,” in particular by not “invok[ing] Ex parte Young,” is “fatal.” \nKeegan Mot. to Dismiss at 7.  She cites no authority for the proposition that a plaintiff must\nplead the application of the doctrine established in that case in order to rely upon it.\n8 The Eleventh Amendment provides that “[t]he Judicial power of the United States\nshall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against\none of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign\nState.”  U.S. CONST. amend. XI.\n9 HUD, which filed a response to Keegan’s motion, argues that Louisiana has\nconsented to suits alleging violations of federal law by accepting federal funds under HCDA. \nBecause the Court concludes that the Ex parte Young exception to sovereign immunity applies,\nthis opinion need not address this alternative argument.\n7\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 77    Filed 09/07/10   Page 8 of 21\nWRIGHT ET AL., FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 4232 (3d ed. 2007)).  This doctrine relies\non “the fiction that the suit [goes] against the officer and not the State, thereby avoiding\nsovereign immunity’s bar.”  Id. (citing Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89,\n114 n.25 (1984)).10 \ni. Keegan is not an improper defendant.\nFirst, the Court rejects Keegan’s argument that because it is the LRA, not herself, who is\nresponsible for the actions at issue and because the LRA must obtain approval for its actions, Ex\nparte Young does not apply.  Cases analyzing and applying the doctrine established in Ex parte\nYoung do not inquire into the state officer’s personal actions or responsibility for the alleged\nviolation of federal law by an agency, and, by extension, a state.  See, e.g., Verizon Md. Inc. v.\nPub. Serv. Comm’n of Md., 535 U.S. 635, 645 (2002) (holding that “the doctrine of Ex parte\nYoung avoids an Eleventh Amendment bar to suit” against the individual commissioners of a\nstate commission without discussing the responsibilities or authority of a commissioner).  Nor\nhas Keegan cited to any authority supporting the contention that the requirement that a state\nofficial consult with other entities before taking action negates the ability of a private party to sue\nthat official for violations of federal law.11\n10 In addition to the arguments described above and addressed below, Keegan\ncontends that because Louisiana, rather than herself or the LRA, is the “real party in interest,” she\nmay invoke sovereign immunity as a bar to this suit.  Keegan Mot. to Dismiss at 4.  It should be\nclear from the Court’s brief explanation of Ex parte Young that this contention does not have\nmerit.  Furthermore, the Supreme Court has so noted.  See Coeur D’Alene, 521 U.S. at 269\n(observing that “[w]hen suit is commenced against state officials, even if they are named and\nserved as individuals, the State itself will have a continuing interest in the litigation whenever\nstate policies or procedures are at stake” but continuing to follow Ex parte Young).\n11 Furthermore, Keegan’s underlying premise regarding her responsibilities appears\nto be incorrect.  As HUD notes in the response it filed to Keegan’s motion, the Louisiana statute\n8\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 77    Filed 09/07/10   Page 9 of 21\nii. The exception to Ex parte Young established in Coeur D’Alene does\nnot apply.\nThe Court next addresses Keegan’s third argument.  Coeur D’Alene, the case on which\nKeegan relies, barred the Coeur D’Alene Tribe and some of its members from suing the State of\nIdaho where they sought a declaration that the Tribe owned certain land submerged by water and\nthat Idaho’s regulation of that land was invalid.  Coeur D’Alene, 521 U.S. at 265, 282.  The\nSupreme Court held that these remedies would so significantly infringe on the state’s “sovereign\nauthority and its standing in the Union” as to not properly be before a federal court.  Id.  The\nopinion focused on the total inability to “exercis[e] . . . governmental powers” the relief the Tribe\nsought would effect and discussed at length the significance of a state’s control of submerged\nlands and navigable waters.  Id. at 282, 283-88.  No such significant state interest is implicated\nhere.  The relief plaintiffs seek would not prevent Louisiana from acting as a sovereign over any\nland, nor would it even take full control of the Road Home Program.  Because “[a]n allegation of\nan ongoing violation of federal law where the requested relief is prospective is ordinarily\nsufficient to invoke the Young fiction,” id. at 281, and the Court finds nothing extraordinary\nabout the case before it, Keegan’s argument fails.\niii. Plaintiffs’ claims may go forward only insofar as they seek\nprospective relief.\nKeegan’s second argument raises more difficult questions.  Suits brought under the Ex\nparte Young doctrine are only proper if they seek prospective, as opposed to retrospective, relief. \nVann, 534 F.3d at 750 (“In determining whether the doctrine of Ex parte Young avoids an\ngoverning the LRA provides that the agency’s Executive Director’s “powers, duties, and\nfunctions” include “[t]o discharge all operational, administrative, and executive functions of the\nauthority.”  La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 49:220.5(D)(2). \n9\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 77    Filed 09/07/10   Page 10 of 21\nEleventh Amendment bar to suit, a court need only conduct a straightforward inquiry into\nwhether [the] complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly\ncharacterized as prospective.”  (quoting Verizon Md. Inc., 535 U.S. at 645) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).  A request for relief that would require payment from the state treasury, rather\nthan that a state officer “conform [her] future conduct to the requirement of” a federal law, is\nbarred by the Eleventh Amendment.  Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 664 (1974) (holding that\nan order “which requires the payment of a very substantial amount of money which . . . should\nhave been paid, but was not” by the state to citizens eligible for a federal aid program was\nimproper because such a retrospective award violated sovereign immunity).  \nIt is the application of this principle of law to the facts of this case that has occupied the\nparties and the Court in significant part in the two motions for TROs and preliminary injunctions,\nthe oppositions to those motions, and the Court’s opinions ruling on them.  Accordingly, the\nCourt will not repeat here its understanding of how the doctrine controls under these\ncircumstances.  Based on the reasoning in the Court’s Clarification and its opinions denying the\nfirst motion for a TRO and preliminary injunction and granting the second, the Court concludes\nthat dismissal in part is warranted on this ground.  The Court does not have subject-matter\njurisdiction over any portion of this case seeking retroactive relief; in other words, to the extent\nplaintiffs seek correction of awards already distributed in accordance with an allegedly\ndiscriminatory formula, their case must be dismissed.  As to any individuals who have not yet\nreceived initial awards of Option 1 grants, the case may go forward and plaintiffs may seek a\npermanent injunction that, like the preliminary injunction now in place, prohibits Keegan from\ncalculating Option 1 grants based on the pre-storm value of a home. \n10\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 77    Filed 09/07/10   Page 11 of 21\nBecause each of the five individual plaintiffs has already received an Option 1 award,\nnone have a claim over which the Court has jurisdiction.  Accordingly, Burns, Dents, Ford,\nJones, and Randolph may not remain parties to this case.\n2. Count I of plaintiffs’ complaint may go forward, but only as to section\n3604(a).\ni. Keegan’s argument that plaintiffs fail to state a claim under 42 U.S.C.\n§ 3604(a) does not have merit.\nKeegan next argues that plaintiffs’ FHA claim as to her should be dismissed for failure to\nstate a claim.12  She asserts that because Option 1 is “solely a compensation program,” section\n3604(a) of the FHA does not apply.  Keegan Mot. to Dismiss at 20.  Citing a variety of cases\ndismissing FHA claims, Keegan reasons that section 3604(a) of the FHA, which provides that “it\nshall be unlawful . . . to . . . make unavailable or deny[] a dwelling to any person because of\nrace,” 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a), applies only to situations in which a prospective homeowner or renter\nis unable to acquire housing. \nPlaintiffs respond that Keegan is obligated by the terms of the block grant program\npursuant to which the Road Home program was created to comply with the FHA.  They also\n12 Under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a court may dismiss\na complaint, or any portion of it, for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 requires that a complaint contain “a\nshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.”  Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 8(a)(2).  The Supreme Court has explained that “the pleading standard Rule 8 announces does\nnot require ‘detailed factual allegations,’ but it demands more than an unadorned,\nthe-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation.  A pleading that offers ‘labels and conclusions’\nor ‘a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.’”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, —\nU.S. —, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555\n(2007)) (internal citation omitted).  A court considering a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule\n12(b)(6) must assume that all factual allegations in the complaint are true, even if they are\ndoubtful.  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555.\n11\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 77    Filed 09/07/10   Page 12 of 21\nassert that she agreed to comply with the FHA as a condition of receiving funds to disperse\nthrough the Road Home program.  Finally, plaintiffs argue that because they allege that they have\nbeen unable to repair their homes, and in some cases have been unable to live in their homes at\nall, their complaint sufficiently makes out a claim under section 3604(a).  They contend, relying\non different cases than Keegan cites, that the provision’s language prohibiting “mak[ing]\nunavailable or deny[ing]” housing on the basis of race should be construed broadly to encompass\n“any conduct that hinders access to housing on the basis of race.”  Pls.’ Opp’n at 28.\nThe Court will not dismiss plaintiff’s FHA claim on this ground.  Section 3604(a) of the\nFHA provides:\nIt shall be unlawful . . . [t]o refuse to sell or rent after the making of a bona fide\noffer, or to refuse to negotiate for the sale or rental of, or otherwise make\nunavailable or deny, a dwelling to any person because of race, color, religion, sex,\nfamilial status, or national origin.\n42 U.S.C. § 3604(a) (emphasis added).  The scope of the “otherwise make unavailable or deny”\nlanguage is not entirely clear.  Keegan asserts, and plaintiffs do not dispute, that the question\nraised here—whether a grant program for disaster recovery with an alleged racially\ndiscriminatory impact falls within the text’s meaning—has not been addressed by any other\nfederal court.  But courts have discussed the “broad purpose of the FHA,” Nat’l Cmty.\nReinvestment Coal. v. Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co., 573 F. Supp. 2d 70, 77 (D.D.C.\n2008), which is to “promote integrated housing patterns and to discourage discrimination in\naccess to housing,” Nat’l Fair Housing Alliance v. Prudential Ins. Co., 208 F. Supp. 2d 46, 57\n(D.D.C. 2002) (citing Trafficante v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 409 U.S. 205, 211-12 (1972)).  And the\nD.C. Circuit has made clear that “make unavailable” means not just preventing access to new\n12\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 77    Filed 09/07/10   Page 13 of 21\nhousing by prospective buyers and renters but also the loss of housing to those who already\noccupy it.  2922 Sherman Ave. Tenants’ Ass’n v. Dist. of Columbia, 444 F.3d 673, 685 (D.C. Cir.\n2006) (“Telling the tenants either that their ‘occupancy . . . is . . . prohibited’ or that they must\n‘seek alternative housing’ certainly qualifies as making the buildings ‘unavailable’ under the\nFHA.”); see also Hargraves v. Capital City Mortg. Corp., 140 F. Supp. 2d 7, 20 (D.D.C. 2000)\n(holding that section 3604(a) applies to “predatory practices” in lending because those practices\n“can make housing unavailable by putting borrowers at risk of losing the property which secures\ntheir loans”). \nThe cases on which Keegan relies do not persuade the Court that section 3604(a) is\ninapplicable here.  In each opinion, the relevant Circuit Court concluded that an action farther\nremoved from the statutory language than the one alleged here did not fall under the FHA.  See\nCox v. City of Dallas, Tex., 430 F.3d 734, 740 (5th Cir. 2005) (concluding that a challenge to a\ncity’s placement of a dump near a residential area, which reduced the value of existing homes, “is\nnot a claim of ‘unavailability’ or ‘den[ial]’ of housing under a proper reading of the FHA”\n(alteration in original)); Jersey Heights Neighborhood Ass’n v. Glendening, 174 F.3d 180, 192\n(4th Cir. 1999) (holding that the construction of a bypass road, which would “clos[e] off\nexpansion” of an African-American neighborhood, does not have a sufficient “causal link” to the\ndenial of housing to state a claim under section 3604(a)); Southend Neighborhood Improvement\nAss’n v. County of St. Clair, 743 F.2d 1207, 1210 (7th Cir. 1984) (holding that allegations that\n“the County’s discriminatory refusal to properly manage the properties it owns damaged\n[plaintiffs’] interests in neighboring properties” do not implicate section 3604(a)).  Each of these\ncases acknowledges the broad reach of the text of section 3604(a) to actions other than sales and\n13\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 77    Filed 09/07/10   Page 14 of 21\nrentals that are tied to housing.  Cox, 430 F.3d at 741-42 & n.18 (including a string cite of\ncitations to cases applying section 3604(a), distinguishing the facts before it, and noting that the\ncourt’s holding “is not to say that a current owner or renter evicted or constructively evicted from\n[her] house does not have a claim”); Jersey Heights, 174 F.3d at 192 (listing examples of\n“housing-related” policies, such as “racial steering by real estate agents,” that fall under section\n3604(a)’s prohibition of discrimination); Southend Neighborhood, 743 F.2d at 1209-10 & n.3\n(same, and including examples such as “mortgage ‘redlining,’ insurance redlining, . . . [and]\nexclusionary zoning decisions”).  The claim here rests not on a reduction in property values or a\nlimit on the growth of a residential area but on the inability of homeowners to inhabit their\nhouses because of a Road Home Program formula.13  Consequently, the Court shall not dismiss\nplaintiffs’ FHA claim pursuant to section 3604(a) against Keegan.\nii. Plaintiffs’ claims under sections 3605(a) and 3608(d), (e)(5) of the\nFHA may not go forward as to Keegan.\nAs noted above, Count I of plaintiffs’ complaint also states causes of action under 42\nU.S.C. §§ 3605(a) and 3608(d), (e)(5).  These claims may not go forward against Keegan.  \n13 The complaint does not directly allege that homeowners who have applied for but\nnot yet received Option 1 grants are unable to live in their homes.  But because this case is before\nthe Court on a motion to dismiss, the Court must “accept[] as true all of the factual allegations\ncontained in the complaint and draw[] all inferences in favor of” plaintiffs.  City of Harper\nWoods Emps. Ret. Sys. v. Olver, 589 F.3d 1292, 1298 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (citing Ctr. for Law &\nEduc. v. Dep’t of Educ., 396 F.3d 1152, 1156 (D.C. Cir. 2005)).  The Court finds that it is a\nreasonable inference from the devastating effects of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, Compl. ¶ 31\n(“As a result of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, more than half a million New Orleans residents\nwere displaced and more than 53,000 homes in New Orleans were damaged or destroyed.”), and\nthe eligibility requirements for the Road Home Program, Compl. ¶ 43 (“Eligible homeowners are\nthose who . . . had FEMA catagorize their home as destroyed or having suffered major\ndamage.”), that many prospective Option 1 beneficiaries cannot live in their homes.\n14\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 77    Filed 09/07/10   Page 15 of 21\nSection 3605(a) prohibits “any person or other entity whose business includes engaging in\nresidential real estate-related transactions [from] discriminat[ing] against any person in making\navailable such a transaction, or in the terms or conditions of such a transaction, because of race”\nor other enumerated categories.  42 U.S.C. § 3605(a).  Keegan makes two arguments as to this\nprovision.  First, she contends that Road Home Program recipients “were allowed to use the\nfunds . . . in any way they chose, and were not required to use the funds to rebuild or repair their\nhomes,” Keegan Mot. to Dismiss at 31, so Program awards cannot be said to be “for purchasing,\nconstructing, improving, repairing, or maintaining a dwelling,” 42 U.S.C. § 3605(b)(1)(a)\n(defining “residential real estate transaction”).  Second, she asserts that she was not engaged in\nthe type of financial practices contemplated by section 3605, such as providing information about\nor administering policies regarding loans for the purchase of homes.  Plaintiffs do not respond to\neither of these points; their opposition to the arguments in Keegan’s motion to dismiss does not\nmention section 3605(a) at all.  Accordingly, the Court considers the arguments to be conceded. \nSee Buggs v. Powell, 293 F. Supp. 2d 135, 141 (D.D.C. 2003) (“It is understood in this Circuit\nthat when a plaintiff files an opposition to a dispositive motion and addresses only certain\narguments raised by the defendant, a court may treat those arguments that the plaintiff failed to\naddress as conceded.”  (citing FDIC v. Bender, 127 F.3d 58, 67-68 (D.C. Cir. 1997); Stephenson\nv. Cox, 223 F. Supp. 2d 119, 121 (D.D.C. 2002))). \nDespite moving for dismissal of plaintiff’s entire complaint as to her, Keegan makes no\nargument directly addressing section 3608, which provides in relevant part that “[a]ll executive\ndepartments and agencies shall administer their programs and activities relating to housing and\nurban development . . . in a manner affirmatively to further the purposes of this subchapter,” 42\n15\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 77    Filed 09/07/10   Page 16 of 21\nU.S.C. § 3608(d), and the Secretary of HUD shall “administer the programs and activities\nrelating to housing and urban development in a manner affirmatively to further the policies of\nthis subchapter,” id. § 3608(e)(5).  The Court will nevertheless dismiss plaintiffs’ claims against\nKeegan pursuant to this provision because Keegan, a state officer, is neither an executive\ndepartment or agency nor the Secretary of HUD; therefore, these provisions do not mandate or\nprohibit any action by her.\n3. Count II of plaintiffs’ complaint must be dismissed as against Keegan\nbecause plaintiffs cannot sue her under 42 U.S.C. § 5304(b)(2).\nCount II of plaintiffs’ complaint alleges that Keegan and HUD have violated\n42 U.S.C. § 5304(b)(2), a provision of the HCDA, which requires:\nAny grant under section 5306 of this title shall be made only if the grantee\ncertifies to the satisfaction of the Secretary [of HUD] that . . . the grant will be\nconducted and administered in conformity with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and\nthe Fair Housing Act, and the grantee will affirmatively further fair housing.\n  \n42 U.S.C. § 5304(b)(2).  Specifically, plaintiffs allege that defendants have “failed to administer\nthe [Road Home Program] in a manner that affirmatively furthers fair housing.”  Compl. ¶ 77. \nNo party disputes that the grants to Louisiana for purposes of administering the Road Home\nProgram are subject to this provision.  \nKeegan has moved for dismissal of this claim as against her, however, on the ground that\nthere is no private right of action under this provision.14  First, she asserts that the remedies for\nany violation of section 5304(b)(2) are those described in the 42 U.S.C. § 5311, which provides\n14 Keegan also argues that there is no basis for this cause of action because she\ncomplied with the requirements of section 5304(b)(2) by making the necessary certifications\ndescribed therein.  But plaintiffs do not argue that she failed to make these certifications; they\nargue that she failed to adhere to the promise to affirmatively further fair housing. \n16\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 77    Filed 09/07/10   Page 17 of 21\nthat the Secretary of HUD may, if a grant recipient has failed to comply with the HCDA,\nterminate grant payments or refer the matter to the U.S. Attorney General to initiate a civil action. \nSecond, she contends that this Court should follow others that have held that Congress did not\nintend to allow private suits under the HCDA. \nPlaintiffs disagree.  They argue first that Congress plainly intended to allow for private\nrights of action under the HCDA, relying on legislative history and Montgomery Improvement\nAss’n v. HUD, 645 F.2d 291 (5th Cir. 1981), a Fifth Circuit case permitting such a suit.  Second,\nthey argue that even if their first argument is incorrect, they may go forward with their claim\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\nThe Court cannot agree with either of plaintiffs’ contentions.  Although “whether a\nstatutory violation may be enforced through § 1983 ‘is a different inquiry than that involved in\ndetermining whether a private right of action can be implied from a particular statute,’” Gonzaga\nUniv. v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 283 (2002) (quoting Wilder v. Va. Hosp. Ass’n, 496 U.S. 498, 508\nn.9 (1990)), both “require a determination as to whether or not Congress intended to confer\nindividual rights upon a class of beneficiaries,” id. at 285.  Courts have found that some\nprovisions of the HCDA do indicate such an intent.  See Price v. City of Stockton, 390 F.3d 1105,\n1111 (9th Cir. 2004) (concluding that 42 U.S.C. § 5304(k) “evinces a clear intent to create a\nfederal right” because it “requires that benefits be provided to particular persons displaced by\nfederally funded redevelopment activities”); Chan v. City of New York, 1 F.3d 96, 104 (2d Cir.\n1993) (concluding that plaintiffs could bring a section 1983 action for a violation of\n42 U.S.C. § 5310, “the provision for payment of a certain minimum wage” to workers employed\nwith funds from grants under the HCDA, because that provision “confers its principal benefit on\n17\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 77    Filed 09/07/10   Page 18 of 21\nthe wage earners,” who are “clearly specified” as “laborers and mechanics”).15  But the provision\nunder which plaintiffs seek to sue is distinct from those that are “phrased with an unmistakable\nfocus on the benefitted class.”  Gonzaga Univ., 536 U.S. at 284 (quoting Cannon v. Univ. of\nChicago, 441 U.S. 677, 692 (1979)).  It does not identify any class of people who will benefit\nfrom the grantee’s certification that it will further fair housing.  And the broad statement in the\nHCDA’s declaration of purpose that Congress sought, among other goals, to promote “[d]ecent\nhousing, suitable living environment, and economic opportunities for persons of low and\nmoderate income,” 42 U.S.C. § 5301(c), is not specific enough to confer rights.  This conclusion\nis especially correct here, where homeowners with viable claims are not low- and moderate-\nincome individuals; those beneficiaries of the Road Home Program are eligible for ACGs\nsupplementing their Option 1 grants and so are not subject to the alleged discriminatory effect of\n15 Precedent is split as to 42 U.S.C. § 5309, which provides: “No person in the\nUnited States shall on the ground of race, color, national origin, religion, or sex be excluded from\nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or\nactivity funded in whole or in part with funds made available under [the HCDA].” \n42 U.S.C. § 5309(a).  Compare Montgomery Improvement Ass’n, 645 F.2d at 296 (relying on\n“the fact that the district court in this case found plaintiffs to be members of the class Congress\nintended to be especially benefitted” in “concluding that the anti-discrimination provisions of the\n[HCDA] permit the bringing of a private cause of action”), with Latinos Unidos de Chelsea v.\nSec’y of Hous., 799 F.2d 774, 794 (1st Cir. 1986) (concluding, as to a claim under 42 U.S.C. §\n5309 by individuals who were allegedly discriminated against, that Title I of HCDA was not\n“enacted for their ‘especial benefit’ in the sense required for finding a private right of action”);\nsee also Freeman v. Fahey, 374 F.3d 663, 665 (8th Cir. 2004) (holding that 42 U.S.C. § 5309\ndoes not confer a private right of action because Congress did not intend to create a private\nremedy where other methods of enforcement exist, but not addressing whether a section 1983\naction could have survived based on the intent to benefit a particular class of individuals). \nBecause plaintiffs have not stated a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 5309, the Court need not address the\nquestion of whether they could have done so.\n18\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 77    Filed 09/07/10   Page 19 of 21\nthe Option 1 formula.16  Consequently, the Court will grant Keegan’s request to dismiss Count II\nas to her.\nB. Motion to Transfer\nKeegan moves for transfer of this case to the Middle District of Louisiana, in which\nBaton Rouge, the capital of Louisiana, is located, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a).17  That statute\nprovides that “[f]or the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district\ncourt may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been\nbrought.”  28 U.S.C. § 1404(a).18  To assess whether transfer pursuant to section 1404(a) is\nappropriate, the court will “balance a number of case-specific factors which include the private\ninterests of the parties as well as public interests such as efficiency and fairness.”  Wilderness\nSoc’y v. Babbitt, 104 F. Supp. 2d 10, 12 (D.D.C. 2000) (citing Stewart Org., Inc. v. Ricoh Corp.,\n487 U.S. 22, 30 (1988)).19 \n16 Plaintiffs made explicit in a filing submitted in the course of briefing their first\nmotion for a TRO that they now seek relief only as to “middle class African American\nhomeowners who received grants based on pre-storm value [of their homes, rather than the cost\nof repair] and did not receive an Additional Compensation Grant of any amount.”  Pls.’ Reply to\nKeegan Opp’n to Pls.’ First Mot. for TRO at 3.  As explained above, lower-income homeowners\ncould receive ACGs such that their total Option 1 awards were either the amount of the cost of\nrepair or $150,000, whichever was less, so they are no longer subject to the allegedly\ndiscriminatory practice of taking home value into account in calculating grants.\n17 Keegan asks in the alternative that the Court transfer the case to the Eastern\nDistrict of Louisiana, in which New Orleans is located. \n18 Plaintiffs concede that this case could have been brought in the Middle District of\nLouisiana. \n19 The private interest factors include: (1) plaintiff’s choice of forum, (2) defendant’s\nchoice of forum, (3) whether the claim arose elsewhere, (4) convenience of the parties,\n(5) convenience of the witnesses, and (6) ease of access to sources of proof.  Wilderness Soc’y,\n104 F. Supp. 2d at 12 (quoting Trout Unlimited v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 944 F. Supp. 13, 16\n19\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 77    Filed 09/07/10   Page 20 of 21\nKeegan argues that both the private and public interests weigh in favor of transferring this\ncase.  She asserts that plaintiffs’ choice of forum should be afforded little deference because none\nof the individual plaintiffs reside in the District of Columbia.  She further asserts that the claims\narose in Baton Rouge, because that is where the LRA sits and where it developed and now\nadministers the Road Home Program.  Moreover, Keegan contends that the Middle District of\nLouisiana has a strong interest in the case, which revolves around the damage from storms that\noccurred in Louisiana and a program designed to assist people who live there.  On the other hand,\naccording to Keegan, the District of Columbia has no direct ties to or interest in this case.\nPlaintiffs respond that their choice of forum should be given significant weight.  They\nalso note that HUD’s assistance in developing and approval of the Road Home Program occurred\nin, and plaintiff National Fair Housing Alliance is based in, the District of Columbia.  As to the\npublic interest factors, they note that the Middle District of Louisiana has no special expertise in\nthe legal questions this case raises.  Furthermore, they contend that the District of Columbia, as\nthe seat of the federal government, has an interest in the enforcement of federal statutes as well as\nadherence to those statutes by federal agencies, such as HUD.\nAlthough several factors do weigh in favor of Keegan’s request, the Court will not\nexercise its discretion to transfer this case.  At this point, this Court is familiar with the facts and\nlegal issues raised, and two of its opinions in this action are on appeal to the D.C. Circuit. \nTherefore, the interests of justice—in particular, in judicial efficiency—weigh strongly on the\n(D.D.C. 1996)).  The public interest factors include: (1) the transferee district’s familiarity with\nthe governing laws, (2) the relative congestion of both the transferor and transferee courts’\ncalendars, and (3) the local interest in deciding local controversies at home.  Id. (quoting Trout\nUnlimited, 944 F. Supp. at 16). \n20\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 77    Filed 09/07/10   Page 21 of 21\nside of keeping the Court in this district.  Cf. Navajo Nation v. Peabody Holding Co., Inc., 209 F.\nSupp. 2d 269, 280 (D.D.C. 2002) (denying a motion to transfer in part because where “th[e] case\nhas been pending in this Court for almost three years, during which time the Court has\nconsidered and resolved a variety of potentially dispositive motions and discovery disputes,” the\n“interests of judicial efficiency” would not have been served by transfer).  Accordingly, the Court\nwill not grant this motion.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, it is this 7th day of September 2010 hereby\nORDERED that Keegan’s motion to dismiss [#28] is GRANTED in part and DENIED\nin part; and it is further\nORDERED that Keegan’s motion to transfer [#28] is DENIED.\nHenry H. Kennedy, Jr.\nUnited States District Judge\n21",

No. 22) demonstrated that the limited waiver of sovereign immunity extended by\nCongress in § 702 of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq., would\nnot apply in this case because Congress has provided plaintiffs with a fully adequate alternative\nremedy for their discrimination claims against HUD.1  HUD demonstrated that plaintiffs could\nbring a cause of action directly against Defendant Paul Rainwater (“Rainwater”), in his official\ncapacity as Executive Director of the Louisiana Recovery Authority (“LRA”) with respect to\nplaintiffs’ claims of race discrimination in the administration of Hurricane Katrina disaster\nrecovery Community Development Block Grant (“CDBG”) funds under the Fair Housing Act\n(“FHA”), 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq., and the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974\n(“HCDA”), 42 U.S.C. § 5301 et seq., and directly against the State of Louisiana under Title VI of\n1  To be clear, HUD’s motion to dismiss demonstrated that plaintiffs failed to allege a\nwaiver of sovereign immunity by the United States in any form, and also argued that the APA\nwould not provide a waiver of sovereign immunity in this instance.  See HUD Mot. to Dismiss at\n27-29, 29-39.\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 33    Filed 06/05/09   Page 2 of 24\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-7.  \nDefendant Rainwater’s motion to dismiss challenges, on behalf of the LRA, plaintiffs\nability to bring their race discrimination claims directly against the state agency and also\nchallenges the ability of plaintiffs to seek judicial enforcement of the FHA and the HCDA\nagainst him under the doctrine of Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908).  See Rainwater Mot. to\nDismiss and Mot. to Transfer (Doc. No. 28-2).  HUD, both on its own and through the\nDepartment of Justice, has authority to enforce Title VI, the FHA, and the HCDA to ensure\ncompliance with their terms.  42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1; 42 U.S.C. § 3612; 42 U.S.C. § 5311. \nHowever, because of the inherent limitations on the litigation resources of the United States,\nHUD has an interest in ensuring that the non-discrimination requirements of Title VI, the FHA,\nand the HCDA can be enforced by private parties to the extent permitted by the statutes and the\nConstitution. \nRainwater’s claim, on behalf of the LRA, that the Eleventh Amendment to the U.S.\nConstitution bars plaintiffs’ suit because the LRA is the real party at interest, ignores both the\napplicability of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, and the\nLouisiana state legislature’s waiver of the LRA’s immunity and consent to suit, at least in state\ncourt.  See La. Rev. Stat. § 49:220.4.  Title VI not only prohibits race discrimination by recipients\nof federal funds but also unambiguously waives a state’s immunity from suit in federal court as a\ncondition of accepting that financial assistance.  Moreover, Congress has authorized a private\ncause of action under the FHA enforceable in state court.  Because plaintiffs can bring suit\ndirectly against Louisiana in federal court to enforce Title VI, and because plaintiffs can bring\nsuit directly against the LRA to enforce the FHA in state court, plaintiffs have an adequate\nremedy at law.  Moreover, plaintiffs’ ability to pursue claims under Title VI and the FHA\nprovides an adequate remedy to any discrimination claims they may have under the HCDA.\n- 2 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 33    Filed 06/05/09   Page 3 of 24\nSimilarly meritless is Rainwater’s claim that the Eleventh Amendment bars plaintiffs’\nsuit against him in his official capacity as Executive Director of the LRA, despite the long-settled\nexception to this immunity established by Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908).  It is well settled\nthat Ex parte Young permits private parties to bring suit against state officials to require them to\nconform their conduct with federal law.  Rainwater also errs in his contention that his use of\nfederal disaster recovery CDBG funds under the HCDA implicate the “special sovereignty\ninterests” recognized in Coeur d’Alene Tribe of Idaho v. Idaho, 521 U.S. 261 (1997).  Courts\nhave repeatedly found that the disbursal of federal funds consistent with applicable federal law\ndoes not implicate matters essential to state sovereignty. \nFinally, this Court should not consider Rainwater’s motion to transfer venue to the\nMiddle District of Louisiana, unless and until it determines it has subject matter jurisdiction over\nplaintiffs’ claims against HUD.  If the court were to consider the motion, neither the private\nfactors nor the public factors governing transfer motions support Rainwater’s motion.  \nAccordingly, Rainwater’s motion to transfer should be denied.\nII. ARGUMENT\nA. The Administrative Procedure Act Would Not Waive Sovereign Immunity of\nthe United States for Plaintiffs’ Claims Against HUD Because There Are\nOther Adequate Remedies at Law\nHUD’s motion to dismiss demonstrated that suit against a federal agency can be\nmaintained under the APA only if there is a “final agency action for which there is no other\nadequate remedy in a court.”  5 U.S.C. § 704 (emphasis added).  See HUD Mot. to Dismiss at\n32-35.  The D.C. Circuit has repeatedly found that suit against a federal agency under the APA is\nprecluded whenever suit could be maintained against an allegedly discriminating non-federal\nentity that has accepted federal funds.  See, e.g., Wash. Legal Found. v. Alexander, 984 F.2d 483\n(D.C. Cir. 1993) (finding no waiver of immunity under the APA in suit against the Department of\n- 3 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 33    Filed 06/05/09   Page 4 of 24\nEducation for Title VI violations because plaintiffs had an implied right of action against\nindividual educational institutions); Women’s Equity Action League v. Cavazos, 906 F.2d 742\n(D.C. Cir. 1990) (no waiver of immunity under the APA in suit against the Departments of\nEducation and Labor because implied rights of action existed against federally funded\ninstitutions). \nIn this case, plaintiffs bring race discrimination claims under the FHA and the HCDA\nagainst HUD for its “consultation,” “approval,” and “continuing oversight” of the LRA’s Road\nHome program.  Compl. ¶¶ 49-51, 74-77.  However, contrary to Rainwater’s assertion, plaintiffs\ncan maintain these race discrimination claims under Title VI against the State of Louisiana in\nfederal court, under the FHA directly against the LRA in state court, or, against Rainwater (or\nany other necessary Louisiana state officials), to the extent that plaintiffs raise valid claims for\nprospective injunctive relief,2 under the doctrine of Ex parte Young.  Thus, because Congress has\nprovided plaintiffs with an adequate remedy against the State of Louisiana, the LRA, and\nRainwater, the APA does not provide a waiver of immunity by the United States in this instance. \n1. The State of Louisiana Waived its Immunity from Suit in Federal\nCourt Under Title VI Because it Accepted Federal Funds under the\nHCDA\nContrary to Rainwater’s contention, see Rainwater Mot. at 7, neither the state nor the\nLRA has immunity under the Eleventh Amendment in this instance.  The Eleventh Amendment\nbars private suits against a State sued in its own name, absent a valid abrogation by Congress or\nwaiver by the State.  See Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 755-756 (1999).  “Although by its terms\nthe Amendment applies only to suits against a State by citizens of another State,” the Supreme\nCourt has “extended the Amendment’s applicability to suits by citizens against their own states.” \n2  HUD emphasizes that it takes no position as to whether the claims alleged against\nRainwater constitute valid claims for prospective injunctive relief.  \n- 4 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 33    Filed 06/05/09   Page 5 of 24\nUniv. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 362 (2001).  However, Congress may exercise its\nenforcement power under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to abrogate a state’s immunity\nwithout its consent, or a state may waive its immunity and consent to suit in federal court.\nCollege Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Educ. Expense Bd., 527 U.S. 666, 670\n(1999); Atascadero State Hosp. v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 238 (1985).  \nOne way that a state may waive its immunity and consent to suit is by accepting certain\nfederal grants.  Congress “may, in the exercise of its spending power, condition its grants of\nfunds to the States upon their taking certain actions that Congress could not require them to take,\nand . . . acceptance of the funds entails an agreement to the actions.”  Id. at 686.  Accord South\nDakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 207-08 (1987).  Nevertheless, Congress must exercise its waiver\npower explicitly:  a congressional waiver provision is constitutional only if it manifests “a clear\nintent to condition participation in the programs funded under the Act on a State’s consent to\nwaive its constitutional immunity.”  Atascadero, 473 U.S. at 247.3   \nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides that “[n]o person in the United States\nshall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be\ndenied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving\nFederal financial assistance.”  42 U.S.C. § 2000d.  It is beyond question that Title VI provides a\nprivate cause of action against race discrimination.  Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 279\n(2001) (“private individuals may sue to enforce § 601 of Title VI and obtain both injunctive relief\nand damages.); Cannon v. Univ. of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 702 (1979)  (“We have no doubt that\nCongress . . . understood Title VI as authorizing an implied private cause of action for victims of\n3  Although it is true that an effective waiver must be “knowing,” accepting federal funds\non a clear condition constitutes an objective manifestation of knowledge.  As the Court said in\nCollege Savings, when the condition is explicit, “acceptance of the funds entails an agreement to\nthe actions.”  College Savings, 527 U.S. at 686.\n- 5 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 33    Filed 06/05/09   Page 6 of 24\nthe prohibited discrimination.”).   \nMoreover, Title VI further provides that “[a] State shall not be immune under the\nEleventh Amendment of the Constitution of the United States from suit in Federal court for a\nviolation of . . . Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or the provisions of any other Federal\nstatute prohibiting discrimination by recipients of Federal financial assistance.”  42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000d-7(1).  Every circuit that has considered the question has held that the language of this\nprovision of Title VI unambiguously conditions a state agency’s acceptance of federal funds on\nits waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity.  See, e.g., Barbour v. Wash. Metro. Area Trans.\nAuth., 374 F.3d. 1161, 1164 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (“the simple choice offered to states [is]: if they\naccept federal funds, they will lose their immunity.”).  Albeit in dictum, the Supreme Court has\nsaid so as well.  Lane v. Peòa, 518 U.S. 187, 200 (1986) (declaring that “Congress responded to\nour decision in Atascadero by crafting an unambiguous waiver of the States’ Eleventh\nAmendment immunity”) (emphasis added).  \nIn this case, Rainwater does not challenge the fact that Louisiana received federal\nfinancial assistance under the HCDA in the form of disaster recovery CDBG funds.  See\nRainwater Mot. at 6-7.  The HCDA contains several non-discrimination provisions.  For\nexample, it requires grant recipients “to certify that the grant will be conducted and administered\nin conformity with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Fair Housing Act.”  42 U.S.C.\n§ 5304(b)(2).  In addition, the act provides that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the\nground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits\nof, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity funded in whole or in part\nwith funds made available under this chapter.”  Id. § 5309(a).  By accepting federal financial\nassistance in the form of disaster recovery CDBG funds under the HCDA, the State of Louisiana\nhas waived its immunity and has consented to suit in federal court by private plaintiffs for\n- 6 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 33    Filed 06/05/09   Page 7 of 24\nviolations of Title VI.  \n2. Plaintiffs Can Maintain Their FHA Claims Directly Against the LRA\nAlthough Rainwater fails to acknowledge it, the Louisiana state legislature has expressly\nwaived the immunity of the LRA from suit, at least in state court.  The Louisiana State\nConstitution provides that “[t]he legislature may authorize other suits against the state, a state\nagency, or a political subdivision.  A measure authorizing suit shall waive immunity from suit\nand liability.”  La. Const. Art. 12, § 10.  In authorizing the LRA, the Louisiana legislature\nprovided that the LRA “shall be a body corporate with power to sue and be sued.”  La. Rev. Stat.\n§ 49:220.4(A)(1) (emphasis added).  Louisiana state courts have made clear that the legislature’s\ngrant of authority to an entity such as the LRA to “sue and be sued,” at least in state court,\n“amounts to a full Legislative waiver of governmental immunity from suit and liability effective\nand valid for all purposes.”  Warfield v. Fink & McDaniel Plumbing & Heating, 203 So.2d 827,\n829 (La. App. 1967).  See also, e.g., Bd. of Com’rs of Port of New Orleans v. Splendour, 273\nSo.2d 19, 25 (La. 1973) (“Since the legislature had granted the City of Shreveport the power to\nsue and be sued, there was a waiver of whatever immunity the city enjoyed from suit and\nliability.”).  Accordingly, the State of Louisiana has waived the immunity of the LRA and has\nconsented to suit against it by private parties against the LRA, at least in state court.  \nMoreover, Congress has expressly authorized a private cause of action to enforce the\nFHA in either federal or state court.  Specifically, the FHA provides that “an aggrieved person\nmay commence a civil action in an appropriate United States district court or State court . . . to\nobtain appropriate relief with respect to such discriminatory housing practice or breach.”  42\nU.S.C. § 3613(a) (emphasis added).  In light of the Louisiana legislature’s waiver of the LRA’s\nimmunity and consent to suit, at least in state court, plaintiffs can, at the very least, maintain their\n- 7 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 33    Filed 06/05/09   Page 8 of 24\nFHA claims, to the extent they are cognizable at all, directly against the LRA in state court.4\nIn addition, plaintiffs can use Title VI and the FHA to challenge the LRA’s use of disaster\nrecovery CDBG funds under the HCDA.  See Latinos Unidos De Chelsea En Accion v. HUD,\n799 F.2d 774, 794 (1st Cir. 1986) (“Title[] VI and [the FHA] may still be used to challenge any\naction of discrimination by recipients of HCDA funds.”), even though § 5304 of HCDA may not\nprovide private parties with a direct cause of action against grant recipients such as the LRA.  See\nid. (finding that, although Congress’s stated intention in the HCDA was to revitalize the nation’s\ncities through increased housing and economic opportunities, “principally for persons of low and\nmoderate income,” the statute was not enacted for “especial benefit” of minorities in the sense\nrequired for finding a private right of action).  But see Montgomery Imp. Ass’n, Inc. v.HUD, 645\nF.2d 291, 297 (5th Cir. 1981) (finding private right of action to enforce non-discrimination\nprovision of the HCDA against grant recipients).5  Accordingly, plaintiffs’ ability to bring their\n4  Rainwater argues that the discriminatory denials of grant monies under the Road Home\nprogram cannot constitute a violation of the FHA because plaintiffs already owned their homes\nand were not “hindered in acquiring a dwelling.”  Rainwater Mot. at 30.  Rainwater’s claim that\nthe Act does not cover post-acquisition discrimination is erroneous.  The broad language of\n§ 3604(a) of the FHA encompasses post-acquisition actions that prevent residents from using and\noccupying their dwellings and includes no restriction to offenses related to sales or rental\ntransactions.  See 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a).  Courts in this circuit have recognized that the FHA\nprohibits discrimination that prevents residents from occupying the housing they have already\nacquired.  See, e.g., 2922 Sherman Ave. Tenants’ Ass’n v. Dist. of Columbia, 444 F.3d 673, 682\n(D.C. Cir. 2006) (city’s alleged targeting for closure of buildings in disproportionately Hispanic\nneighborhoods stated claim under 3604(a)); Wai v. Allstate Ins. Co., 75 F. Supp. 2d 1, 6 (D.D.C.\n1999) (alleged refusal to provide standard homeowners insurance at ordinary rates to housing\nprovider who rented house to disabled persons states claim of making housing unavailable).  We\nnote also that Rainwater’s reliance on Clifton Terrace Assoc. v United Technologies Corp., 929\nF.2d 714 (D.C. Cir. 1991), is misplaced because that case involved habitability rather than a\ndenial of housing.  See id. at 719.  \nTo be clear, HUD’s motion to dismiss demonstrated that the FHA does not provide a\nwaiver of sovereign immunity by the United States and that plaintiffs failed to state a claim for\nrelief under § 3604(a) for other reasons.  See HUD Mot. to Dismiss at 28-29, 40-43.\n5  In any event, plaintiffs’ sole claim for relief under the HCDA is for a “fail[ure] to\nadminister the [CDBG] program in a manner that affirmatively furthers fair housing.”  Compl.\n- 8 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 33    Filed 06/05/09   Page 9 of 24\nrace discrimination claims under Title VI against Louisiana and under the FHA against the LRA\nprovides an adequate remedy to their HCDA claims.  Latinos Unidos De Chelsea En Accion, 799\nF.2d at 794.  In sum, plaintiffs’ ability to maintain their race discrimination claims under Title VI\ndirectly against the State of Louisiana and under the FHA directly against the LRA provides an\nadequate remedy at law to both plaintiffs’ FHA and HCDA claims against HUD.  As a result, the\nAPA would not provide a waiver of sovereign immunity for plaintiffs’ claims against HUD in\nthis instance.   \n3. Eleventh Amendment Immunity Does Not Allow States to Violate\nFederal Law\nContrary to Rainwater’s suggestion, even if Louisiana had not waived its immunity from\nsuit for claims brought under Title VI by accepting funds under the HCDA, and even if the\nLouisiana state legislature had not waived the LRA’s immunity from suit for claims brought\nunder the FHA, it would not mean that Rainwater, in his official capacity as Executive Director\nof the LRA, would be free to ignore the non-discrimination requirements of the FHA, or that if\nhe did, private parties would not have a remedy against him in federal court.  In Univ. of\nAlabama v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356 (2001), the Supreme Court reaffirmed that Eleventh\nAmendment immunity does not authorize states to violate federal law.  Rather, the Court held\nthat even if “Congress did not validly abrogate the States’ sovereign immunity from suit by\nprivate individuals for money damages . . . [it would] not mean that [private] persons [would]\n¶ 77 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 5304(b)(2)).  This claim is identical to that alleged by the plaintiffs under\nthe FHA:  “Defendants have . . . failed to administer housing-related programs and activities in a\nmanner that affirmatively furthers fair housing.”  Compl. ¶ 76 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 3608(d),\n(e)(5)).  HUD’s motion to dismiss demonstrated that these claims against HUD are not\nreviewable because they do not identify a circumscribed, discrete agency action that HUD is\nrequired to take.  HUD’s Motion to Dismiss at 36-40 (citing  Norton v. S. Utah Wilderness\nAlliance, 542 U.S. 55, 64 (2004)).  Accordingly, the possibility that the HCDA claim may not be\nenforceable against the LRA would not mean that plaintiffs can maintain this claim against HUD. \n- 9 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 33    Filed 06/05/09   Page 10 of 24\nhave no federal recourse against discrimination.”  Id. at 374 n.9; see also Alden, 527 U.S. at\n754-755 (“The constitutional privilege of a State to assert its sovereign immunity . . .  does not\nconfer upon the State a concomitant right to disregard the Constitution or valid federal law.”).  \na. Rainwater Must Conform His Conduct with the Requirements\nof the FHA and the HCDA under the Doctrine of Ex parte\nYoung\nTo reconcile these very principles — that States have Eleventh Amendment immunity\nfrom many private suits, but that they are still bound by federal law — the Supreme Court\nadopted the doctrine of Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908).  See Alden, 527 U.S. at 756.  In Ex\nparte Young, the Court held that, when a state official acts in violation of the Constitution or\nfederal law (which the Constitution’s Supremacy Clause makes the “supreme Law of the Land”),\nhe is deemed to be acting ultra vires and is no longer entitled to the state’s immunity from suit. \nMore recently, the Court has unanimously reiterated that Ex parte Young permits suits against\nstate officials in their official capacities as long as the “complaint alleges an ongoing violation of\nfederal law and seeks relief properly characterized as prospective.”  Verizon Md. v. Pub. Serv.\nCom’n of Md., 535 U.S. 635, 646 (2002).  See also Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 664,\n667-668 (1974); Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 167 n.14 (1985).  By limiting relief to\nprospective injunctions against officials, the doctrine of Ex parte Young avoids courts entering\njudgments directly against the state but, at the same time, prevents the state (through its officials)\nfrom continuing illegal action.\nIn this case, HUD takes no position as to whether the plaintiffs have stated a claim against\nRainwater for prospective injunctive relief under the FHA or the HCDA.  To the extent that the\nplaintiffs have met this requirement, however, Rainwater’s contention that Ex parte Young does\nnot apply is without merit.  Rainwater claims that plaintiffs acknowledge that “the LRA, and not\nPaul Rainwater in his official capacity as Executive Director of the LRA[,] was responsible for\n- 10 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 33    Filed 06/05/09   Page 11 of 24\n. . . the Road Home . . . grant formula.”  Rainwater Mot. at 11.  He further claims that the\nLouisiana statute authorizing the LRA “provides that the LRA, not its Executive Director, has the\nauthority to establish ‘a clear and effective process for the implementation of action plans for the\nCDBG.’”  Rainwater Mot. at 5-6 (citing La. Rev. Stat. § 49:220.5).  But that same statute\nmandates that “[t]he executive director shall have the . . . power[] . . . to discharge all\noperational, administrative and executive functions of the [LRA].”  La. Rev. Stat. § 49:220.5(D)\n(emphasis added).  Because Louisiana state law makes Rainwater responsible for “all . . .\nfunctions” of the LRA, the doctrine of Ex Parte Young permits suit against him to the extent\nthose actions constitute an ongoing violation of federal law. \nRainwater further attempts to disclaim responsibility for the Road Home program by\nalleging that the actions of the LRA pass through “multiple layers of review” beyond the agency,\nincluding an oversight board and the state legislature itself.  Rainwater Mot. at 6-7.  However,\nthe federal special appropriations at issue in this case conditioned receipts of the disaster\nrecovery CDBG funds on each governor’s designation of an entity that the funds would be\n“administered through.”  Pub. L. 109-148.  The Governor of Louisiana designated the LRA to be\nthat entity.  See La. Exec. Order KBB 2005-63 (Oct. 17, 2005).  Because the LRA has been\ndesignated as the entity responsible for administering the CDBG funds, and because Louisiana\nstate law gives Rainwater power over the administrative functions of the LRA, the suit against\nRainwater falls squarely within the Ex parte Young exception to Eleventh Amendment immunity,\nto the extent the plaintiffs’ request for relief is properly characterized as one for prospective\ninjunctive relief for an ongoing violation of federal law.  Accord Verizon Md., 535 U.S. at 646.  \nEven if Rainwater were correct that he alone does not control the use of disaster recovery\nCDBG funds or the Road Home program at issue in this case, it would not mean, as Rainwater\nsuggests, that Ex parte Young is inapplicable.  Rainwater Mot. at 11.  Rather, it would mean only\n- 11 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 33    Filed 06/05/09   Page 12 of 24\nthat, in order to ensure compliance with the requirements of the FHA, plaintiffs would have to\nbring suit against additional Louisiana state officials in their official capacities under the doctrine\nof Ex parte Young. \nb. Coeur d’Alene Tribe of Idaho v. Idaho Does Not Apply\nRainwater contends that the receipt and disbursal of federal disaster recovery funds under\nthe HCDA implicates special sovereignty interests of the state, and therefore invokes the\nexception to the Ex parte Young doctrine that the Supreme Court articulated in Coeur d’Alene\nTribe of Idaho v. Idaho, 521 U.S. 261 (1997).  See Rainwater Mot. at 16-17.  However, this\nassertion ignores the narrow limits of Coeur d’Alene and runs contrary to the weight of circuit\ncourt precedent declining to extend Coeur d’Alene to cases concerning the administration of\nfederally funded programs.  \nIn Coeur d’Alene, a plurality of the Court found that in the “particular and special\ncircumstances” of the case, the sovereign interests of the state were so pressing as to permit an\nexception to Ex parte Young.  Coeur d’Alene, 521 U.S. at 287 (1997).  These interests were\nsufficiently pressing because the dispute concerned Idaho’s control of its submerged lands in the\nface of a suit that was the “functional equivalent” of a quiet title action.  Id. at 281.  Five years\nlater, the Court confirmed the narrow reach of Coeur d’Alene in Verizon Md., 535 U.S. at 646. \nIn Verizon, a unanimous Court did not undertake any inquiry into whether the suit at hand might\nimplicate special state sovereignty concerns.  The Court relied instead on the concurrence and\ndissent in Coeur d’Alene in holding that, to determine whether Ex parte Young applies, “a court\nneed only conduct a ‘straightforward inquiry into whether [the] complaint alleges an ongoing\nviolation of federal law and seeks relief properly characterized as prospective”  Id. at 646\n(quoting Coeur d’Alene, 521 US at 296 (O’Connor, J., concurring), and citing id. at 288-89\n(Souter, J., dissenting)).  Similarly, the D.C. Circuit has declined to “extend Coeur d’Alene\n- 12 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 33    Filed 06/05/09   Page 13 of 24\nbeyond its “‘particular and special circumstance,’ which involved the protection of a State’s\nland.”  Vann v. Kempthorne, 534 F.3d 741, 756 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (quoting Coeur d’Alene, 521\nU.S. at 287).  Accord Tarrant Regional Water District v. Seven Oaks, 545 F.3d 906, 912 (10th\nCir. 2008) (finding no Eleventh Amendment bar to a suit concerning a state’s right to use and sell\nsurface waters because the Supreme Court “limited the reach of Coeur d’Alene” in Verizon Md.). \nAccordingly, the narrow reach of Coeur d’Alene does not encompass the suit against Rainwater\nin this instance, and Ex parte Young should apply to the extent the plaintiffs allege a valid claim\nfor prospective injunctive relief.\nRainwater cites only a single case to support his claim that Coeur d’Alene applies.\nRainwater Mot. at 17 (citing Barton v. Summers, 293 F.3d 944 (6th Cir. 2002)).  In that case, the\nSixth Circuit found that Coeur d’Alene would apply to a suit by Medicaid recipients to intercept\ntobacco settlement money due to Kentucky and Tennessee.  Barton 293 F.3d at 951.  However,\nthe court rested its decision in large part on Congress’s explicit mandate that “ the states are\nspecifically allowed to allocate the [settlement] proceeds as they see fit.”  Id.  By contrast,\nCongress has given no such blanket discretion to the states in conjunction with the disaster\nrecovery CDBG funds at issue in this case, but has instead delineated the eligible activities and\nother requirements for use of the funds.  Indeed, unlike the tobacco funds at issue in Barton,\nRainwater cannot dispute that the funds at issue in this case come directly from the Federal\ntreasury, pursuant to the non-discrimination requirements of the HCDA, rather than from the\nproceeds of a settlement brought by the states against private companies.6  \n6  Of the eight other circuits addressing near-identical challenges to the Medicaid tobacco\nsettlement, none has found Coeur d’Alene applicable.  See Cardenas v. Anzai, 311 F.3d 929 (9th\nCir. 2002); Strawser v. Atkins, 290 F.3d 720 (4th Cir. 2002); Greenless v. Almond, 277 F.3d 601\n(1st Cir. 2002); Harris v. Owens, 264 F.3d 1282 (10th Cir. 2001); Watson v. Texas, 261 F.3d 601\n(5th Cir. 2001); McClendon v. Georgia Dep’t of Cmty. Health, 261 F.3d. 1252 (11th Cir. 2001);\nTyler v. Douglas, 280 F.3d 116 (2d Cir. 2001); Floyd v. Thompson, 227 F.3d 1029 (7th Cir.\n- 13 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 33    Filed 06/05/09   Page 14 of 24\nIndeed, courts have consistently found that no special sovereignty interests are at stake in\nan Ex parte Young action, like the one at hand, seeking to require state officials to follow the\nrequirements of federal law.  See, e.g., Fla. Ass’n of Rehab. Facilities v. Fla. Dep’t of Health &\nRehab. Servs., 225 F.3d 1208, 1218-19 (11th Cir. 2000) (finding “no important sovereignty\ninterests” in “a suit ... seeking to enforce compliance with the federal program under which [the\nstate] ha[s] accepted funds.”); Marie O. v. Edgar, 131 F.3d 610, 617 & n.13 (7th Cir. 1997)\n(permitting a Young-based suit for provision of early intervention services required under the\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act).  In the Medicaid context, the Fourth, Ninth, and\nEleventh Circuits have all permitted such suits even when the outcome had the potential to\nincrease state expenses.  Antrican v. Odom, 290 F.3d 178, 189 (4th Cir. 2004) (finding no\nEleventh Amendment bar to a suit against state officials alleging inadequacies in the provision of\nMedicaid dental services); Children’s Hosp. & Health Ctr. v. Belshe, 188 F.3d 1090, 1095 (9th\nCir. 1999) (finding a Young exception for a challenge to Medicaid reimbursement rates); Doe v.\nChiles, 136 F.3d 709, 719-20 (11th Cir. 1998) (permitting a Young action for “reasonable\npromptness” under the Medicaid Act).  The weight of precedent, then, dictates that the Coeur\nd’Alene exception does not apply in this matter. \nAccordingly, because plaintiffs can maintain suit under the doctrine of Ex parte Young\nagainst Rainwater (and any other Louisiana State officials who administer the disaster recovery\n2000).  The majority of the circuits resolved these challenges on other grounds, but the two\ncircuits that did consider Ex parte Young held that it should apply and explicitly found that Coeur\nd’Alene was not controlling.  Cardenas, 311 F.3d at 938 (“We also reject the defendants’ efforts\nto bring the plaintiffs’ claims within the Coeur d’Alene.”); Harris, 264 F.3d at 1293 (“the\nEleventh Amendment does not ‘extend to every situation where a state property interest is at\nissue;’ Coeur d’Alene represents an ‘extreme and unusual case.’”) (quoting Elephant Butte, 160\nF.3d 602, 612 (10th Cir. 1998)).  In light of the D.C. Circuit’s finding in Vann v. Kempthorne\nconcerning the narrow reach of Coeur d’Alene, this Court should adopt the reasoning of the\nCardenas and Harris courts and reject that of the Sixth Circuit in Barton.\n- 14 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 33    Filed 06/05/09   Page 15 of 24\nCDBG funds and the Road Home program at issue in this case), plaintiffs have an adequate\nremedy at law.  Here again, the existence of an adequate alternative remedy available to plaintiffs\nmeans that the APA would not provide a waiver of sovereign immunity by the United States for\nplaintiffs’ claims against HUD.  \nB. Rainwater’s Motion to Transfer Is Without Merit\nRainwater errs when he asserts that this suit should be transferred to the Middle or\nEastern District of Louisiana, and that this court can consider such a transfer “at any time.” \nRainwater Mot. at 38.  In fact, a court generally cannot address a motion to transfer until it has\nestablished its subject-matter jurisdiction, which is a “fundamentally preliminary” inquiry.  Leroy\nv. Great W. United Corp., 443 U.S. 173, 180 (1979).  Only after this court has determined\nwhether plaintiffs have standing and whether they have overcome the sovereign immunity of\ndefendants HUD and Rainwater can it reach the issue of venue.  At that point, if this court has\nnot dismissed the suit against HUD, it should find that transfer under Section 1404(a) is\ninappropriate.  The plaintiff’s choice of forum deserves “considerable weight,” Pain v. United\nTechs. Corp., 637 F.2d 775, 783 (D.C. Cir. 1980), and the private and public factors relevant in a\ntransfer determination weigh against disturbing plaintiff’s choice to file this suit in the District of\nColumbia. \n1.   This Court Should Determine Whether It Has Subject Matter Jurisdiction\nOver Plaintiffs’ Claims Against HUD Before It Considers Rainwater’s\nMotion to Transfer\nContrary to Rainwater’s contention, Rainwater Mot. at 38,  it would not be appropriate\nfor this Court to consider his transfer motion before determining its subject-matter jurisdiction. \nAs noted above, the Supreme Court has long recognized that the issue of subject-matter\njurisdiction is “fundamentally preliminary.”  Leroy, 443 U.S. at 180.  Courts consistently refuse\nto consider transfer motions before resolving questions of subject-matter jurisdiction.  See, e.g.,\n- 15 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 33    Filed 06/05/09   Page 16 of 24\nDiPilato v. Commonwealth Ass’n of School Administrators, Local 502, 588 F. Supp. 2d 631, 634\n(E.D. Pa. 2008) (finding that because “no federal question jurisdiction exists . . . this court lacks\nthe power to transfer this case”); Marotta Gund Budd & Dzera LLC v. Costa, 340 B.R. 661, 663\nn.2 (D.N.H. 2006) (“Transfer under § 1404(a) is possible only if venue is proper in the original\nforum and federal jurisdiction existed there.  If subject-matter jurisdiction is lacking, there is no\npower to do anything with the case except dismiss”) (quoting 15 Charles A. Wright, et al., Fed.\nPractice and Procedure § 3844 (2005)).  Accord  Morongo Band of Mission Indians v. Cal. State\nBd. of Equalization, 858 F.2d 1376, 1380 (9th Cir. 1988) (“If jurisdiction is lacking at the outset,\nthe district court has “no power to do anything with the case except dismiss.”) (quoting 15 Fed.\nPractice and Procedure § 3844); Atlantic Ship Rigging Co. v. McLellan, 288 F.2d 589, 591 (3d\nCir. 1961) (“Where, as here, the court lacks jurisdiction over the subject-matter, [a defect that]\nprecludes it from acting at all, a fortiori a court lacks power to transfer.”); O’Quinn v. CNH\nAmerica, LLC, 457 F. Supp. 2d 678, 683 n.7 (E.D. Va. 2006) (declining to consider motion to\ntransfer because court found it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction).  \nThe Supreme Court’s recent decision in Sinochem Intern. Co. Ltd. v. Malaysia Intern.\nShipping Corp, 549 U.S. 422 (2007), is not to the contrary.  The Sinochem Court reiterated that\nwhen “a court can readily determine that it lacks jurisdiction over the cause or the defendant, the\nproper course [is] to dismiss on that ground.”  Id. at 436.  In Sinochem, however, jurisdictional\nquestions posed an exceptional burden because “the district court’s subject-matter jurisdiction\npresented an issue of first impression” and discovery concerning personal jurisdiction would\nhave been both expensive and time consuming.  Id. at 435.  In this limited circumstance, the\nCourt found that a preliminary dismissal on the grounds of forum non conveniens was\nappropriate without consideration of jurisdiction because such an approach clearly represented\n“the less burdensome course.”  Id. at 436.  The Court emphasized, however,  that “[i]n the mine\n- 16 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 33    Filed 06/05/09   Page 17 of 24\nrun of cases jurisdiction ‘will involve no arduous inquiry’ and both judicial economy and the\nconsideration ordinarily accorded the plaintiff’s choice of forum ‘should impel the federal court\nto dispose of [those] issue[s] first.’”  Id. at 436 (quoting Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil Co., 526\nU.S. 574, 587-88 (1999)).  \nHere, both as a matter of law and practicality, this court should first determine whether it\nhas subject-matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ claims against HUD before considering the motion\nto transfer.  This matter falls squarely within the “mine run of cases” in which establishing\njurisdiction first will represent the “less burdensome course.”  Sinochem, 549 U.S. at 436.  No\nfurther discovery is required for the court to assess whether it has subject-matter jurisdiction over\nplaintiffs’ claims against HUD.  In contrast, considering Rainwater’s motion to transfer first\nwould interfere both with “judicial economy and the consideration ordinarily afforded plaintiff’s\nchoice of forum.”  Id.  Plaintiffs’ decision to file this complaint in the District of Columbia was\nalmost certainly prompted in part by the recognition that HUD’s offices are in the District of\nColumbia and that all of the challenged HUD actions occurred here.  If, however, HUD is not an\nappropriate party to this suit because subject-matter jurisdiction is lacking, then plaintiffs’\ninterest in this court hearing the suit may be diminished.  Therefore, a determination of subject-\nmatter jurisdiction is a necessary precursor to an accurate evaluation of the motion to transfer.  \nIndeed, while Rainwater notes that in this district one court has ordered a transfer before\nassessing subject-matter jurisdiction, that court was prompted to do so by “adjudicative\nefficiency” concerns that are not present here.  See Rainwater Mot. at 38 (citing Aftab v.\nGonzalez, 597 F. Supp. 2d 76 (D.D.C. 2009)).  In Aftab, the court found that venue in the District\nof Columbia was appropriate because federal officials had been named as defendants.  However,\nunlike in the matter at hand, the alleged involvement of the officials located in the District of\nColumbia was so “attenuated and insignificant,” that even if the officials were proper parties to\n- 17 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 33    Filed 06/05/09   Page 18 of 24\nthe suit, their presence presented no obstacle to a transfer to the alternate venue.  Id. at 82.  In the\npresent case, by contrast, plaintiffs challenge HUD’s consultation, approval, and continuing\noversight of Louisiana’s Road Home program.  Compl. ¶¶ 49-51.  To the extent plaintiffs’ claims\nagainst HUD are cognizable,  the official actions are not obviously “attenuated” or\n“insignificant” to the suit.  Thus, the court must resolve whether HUD is an appropriate party\nbefore it can properly evaluate the motion to transfer.7  \n2. If HUD is to Remain in this Suit, Transfer Is Not Appropriate\nEven if the court determines that it has jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ claims against HUD,\ntransfer to another venue is inappropriate.  The statute authorizing motions to transfer permits a\ncourt to transfer a suit to another district where the action could have been brought if such a\ntransfer accommodates “the convenience of parties and witnesses” and is “in the interest of\njustice.”  28 U.S.C. §1404(a).  The moving party has the burden of establishing that transfer is\nproper under this statute.  Trout Unlimited v. Dep’t of Agric., 944 F. Supp. 13, 16 (D.D.C. 1996). \nRainwater has not met this burden.  \nBefore ordering transfer to another district in which venue is proper, a district court “must\nweigh several private and public interest factors to determine whether transfer would, indeed, be\n‘in the interest of justice.’”  Elemary v. Holzmann, 533 F. Supp. 2d 144, 149 (D.D.C. 2008).  The\nprivate interest factors that must be weighed include: \n(1) the plaintiffs choice of forum, unless the balance of convenience is strongly in favor\nof the defendants; (2) the defendants’ choice of forum; (3) whether the claim arose\nelsewhere; (4) the convenience of the parties; (5) the convenience of the witnesses, but\nonly to the extent that the witnesses may actually be unavailable for trial in one of the\nfora; and (6) the ease of access to sources of proof.\n7  If, however, this court determines that subject-matter jurisdiction with respect to HUD\nis improper and dismisses HUD from the suit, HUD takes no position on whether the transfer\nmotion should be approved.  \n- 18 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 33    Filed 06/05/09   Page 19 of 24\nOtay Mesa Property, L.P. v. U.S. Dep’t of Interior, 584 F. Supp. 2d 122, 124-25 (D.D.C. 2008). \nIn the present case, none of these factors weigh in favor of transfer.  \nThe first factor, the plaintiffs’ choice of forum, strongly supports retaining this suit in the\nDistrict of Columbia.  The D.C. Circuit has expressed a “strong presumption against disturbing\nplaintiffs’ initial forum choice.”  Pain v. United Techs. Corp, 637 F.2d 775, 784 (D.C. Cir.\n1980).  Rainwater errs in his contention that in this case, plaintiffs’ “choice of forum deserves\nlittle deference” because plaintiffs supposedly lack sufficient connection to the District of\nColumbia.  Rainwater ignores that the National Fair Housing Alliance, one of the the\nassociational plaintiffs who brings this action, is headquartered in Washington, D.C.  Rainwater\nalso errs in his contention that the plaintiffs’ choice of forum is entitled to less deference because\n“most of the relevant events occurred elsewhere.”  Rainwater Mot. at 42.  To the extent\nplaintiffs’ claims against HUD are cognizable, the events relevant to those claims occurred\nalmost exclusively within the District of Columbia.  HUD’s “consultation,” “approval,” and\n“continuing oversight” occurred and occurs in Washington, D.C.  HUD Mot. to Dismiss at 13-\n14.  \nFor the same reason, Rainwater errs in his suggestion that the D.C. Circuit’s warnings in\nCameron v. Thornburgh, 983 F.2d 253, 256 (D.C. Cir. 1993), apply here.  In that case, the court\ncautioned that district courts should “guard against the danger that . . . . [b]y naming high\ngovernment officials as defendants, a plaintiff could bring suit here that properly should be\npursued elsewhere.”  Id.  But in Cameron, the court demonstrated that its true concern was\nfrivolous suits against high officials: it not only transferred the case, but dismissed the action\nagainst the federal officials whose presence in the action had justified venue in the District of\nColumbia.  Id. at 257.  As HUD’s motion to dismiss demonstrated, dismissal of plaintiffs’ claims\nagainst HUD in the proper course of action here.  See HUD Mot. to Dismiss passim.  But to the\n- 19 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 33    Filed 06/05/09   Page 20 of 24\nextent the Court determines that it has subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ claims against\nHUD, the events material to those claims occurred in the District of Columbia and the plaintiffs’\nchoice to lodge suit here deserves “considerable . . . weight.”8  Pain, 637 F.2d at 783.  Indeed,\nanother court in this district has found that even when “the nexus between the present\ncontroversy and the [proposed alternate venue] is marginally stronger than the nexus between the\ncontroversy and the District of Columbia,” and even when plaintiff’s choice is accorded\ndiminished deference, this decreased deference is still enough to “tip[] the balance in [the\nplaintiffs’] favor.”  Otay Mesa, 584 F. Supp. 2d at 125.  When, as in this case, the nexus between\nthe controversy and the District of Columbia is itself strong, and and the deference is\nundiminished, the balance should be decidedly in favor of respecting plaintiffs’ chosen venue.  \nThe other private factors do not serve to shift this balance.  It is true that Rainwater\nsupports a motion to transfer, but HUD opposes such a motion.  Thus, the second factor – the\ndefendants’ choice of forum – does not favor Rainwater’s motion.  The third factor – the location\nwhere the claims arose – similarly fails to support a transfer.  Although Rainwater argues that\nclaims against him arose in the Middle District of Louisiana, the claims against HUD, to the\nextent they are even cognizable, arose in the District of Columbia.  And while Rainwater has\nclaimed that the fourth factor, the convenience of the parties, weighs in his favor, Rainwater Mot.\nat 42-43, the plaintiffs clearly view Washington, D.C. as the more convenient forum.  HUD\nwould also be inconvenienced by a transfer to Louisiana because HUD’s record of decision\nmaking is located in the District of Columbia.\n8  Rainwater’s citation to Al-Ahmed v. Chertoff, 564 F. Supp. 2d 16 (D.D.C. 2008), a\nrecent district case approving a transfer motion in part because of the heightened scrutiny of\nvenue suggested by Cameron, is inapposite.  The Al-Ahmed Court specifically found that the\nchallenged federal actions – the adjudications of the plaintiff’s immigration applications – would\noccur in the local immigration offices, not, as in the matter at hand, in the agency headquarters\nlocated in the District of Columbia.  Id. at 18.    \n- 20 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 33    Filed 06/05/09   Page 21 of 24\nThe last two private factors, the “convenience to the witnesses” and the “ease of access to\nsources of proof,” also weigh against transferring this case to the Middle District of Louisiana. \nPlaintiffs have suggested that their case against HUD is not one to be judged solely on the\nadministrative record, a contention HUD strongly disputes.  But if this were the case, all key\nHUD witnesses and documents are located in the District of Columbia.  To the extent, though,\nthat this matter will be tried solely on the administrative record, that record is located in\nWashington, D.C.  Courts have found that in a case involving review of an agency action “the\nlocation of the administrative record . . . . carries some weight.”  Sierra Club v. Flowers, 276 F.\nSupp. 2d 62, 68 (D.D.C. 2003).  Thus, none of the private interest factors act to displace the\n“considerable . . . weight” given to the plaintiffs’ choice of venue.  Pain, 637 F.2d at 783.\nNor do the public interest factors favor a transfer.  Two of the public interest factors that\ncourts typically consider – the familiarity of each district with the relevant laws, and the relative\ncongestion of the districts’ calendars, Trout Unlimited, 944 F. Supp. at 16 – are irrelevant here. \nAll federal courts are presumed to have familiarity with federal laws, In re Korean Air Lines\nDisaster of Sept. 1, 1983, 829 F.2d 1171, 1175 (D.C. Cir. 1987), and the relative congestion of\nthe courts’ dockets is not decisive.  Rainwater therefore relies primarily on the third public\ninterest factor: the interest in deciding local controversies at home.  Rainwater Mot. at 43-44. \nBut many of the considerations courts have identified as significant in determining whether a\ncontroversy is local in nature counsel against such a determination in this case.  These factors\ninclude: \nwhere the challenged decision was made; whether the decision directly affected\nthe citizens of the transferee state; the location of the controversy; whether the\ncontroversy involved issues of state law, whether the controversy has some\nnational significance; and whether there was personal involvement by a District of\nColumbia official. \nOtay Mesa, 584 F. Supp. 2d at 126.  While it is true that the decisions in the matter at hand will\n- 21 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 33    Filed 06/05/09   Page 22 of 24\ndirectly affect the citizens of Louisiana, the challenged HUD decisions were made in the District\nof Columbia, and the claims all charge violations of federal, rather than state, law.  Moreover, if\nHUD remains a defendant, the controversy – involving what constitutes discriminatory oversight\nand administration of federal housing grant programs – could significantly affect HUD’s\nadministration of the CDBG program in the future.  The local interests in this case, then, are not\nstrong enough to outweigh the private interests and the customary deference afforded to the\nplaintiffs’ choice of forum.  See id. at 126-28 (finding that local interests did not support\ntransferring a case concerning the protection of a San Diego endangered fairy shrimp habitat\nfrom the District of Columbia because federal government actors, federal law, and national\ninterests were involved).\nIn sum, Rainwater has not met his burden of proving that a transfer of this case to the\nMiddle or Eastern District of Louisiana will accommodate “the convenience of parties and\nwitnesses.”  28 U.S.C. § 1404(a).  Nor has he demonstrated that such a transfer is “in the interest\nof justice.”  Id.  If the HUD remains a party to the suit, then both convenience and justice are best\nserved by hearing the case in the District of Columbia. \nIII. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons set forth above, this Court should deny the Motion to Dismiss and Motion\nto Transfer of defendant Rainwater.  \n- 22 -\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 33    Filed 06/05/09   Page 23 of 24\nDated: June 5, 2009\nRespectfully submitted,\nTONY WEST\nAssistant Attorney General, Civil Division\nCHANNING D.

Without temporary and, if necessary, \npreliminary injunctive relief, the LRA will continue to commit the balance of available funds, \nmaking those funds unavailable to rectify the disparate impact that past grant awards have had on \nAfrican American homeowners.  Accordingly, the Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court \n1 \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 50-1    Filed 06/02/10   Page 9 of 51\n \npreserve the status quo until it can adjudicate the merits of this action and award whatever relief \nis warranted.   \nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \nOn November 12, 2008, the Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center, National \nFair Housing Alliance, and five African American homeowners from New Orleans (“Plaintiffs”), \nfiled the instant action against the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development \n(“HUD”) and the Louisiana Recovery Authority’s (“LRA”) Executive Director Paul Rainwater, \nalleging that Defendants developed, implemented, and oversaw the Road Home program in \nviolation of the nondiscrimination and affirmative fair housing provisions of the Fair Housing \nAct and the HCDA, because the program has an unlawful disparate impact on African American \nhomeowners.  Dkt. No. 1, ¶¶ 74-77.1  The Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to end \nthe discriminatory operation of the Road Home program and to direct the Defendants to develop \nand apply a new, non-discriminatory grant formula.  Id. at 17.  \nOn March 6, 2009, HUD moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and for failure to state \na claim on which relief can be granted.  Dkt. No. 22.  On May 5, 2009, Rainwater moved to \ndismiss for lack of jurisdiction, failure to state a claim, and a sovereign immunity defense.  Dkt. \nNo. 28.  Rainwater also moved for a transfer of venue to the Middle District of Louisiana.  Id.  \nOn June 5, 2009, Plaintiffs opposed the Defendants’ motions to dismiss and transfer venue.  Dkt. \nNo. 34.  The same day, HUD responded to Rainwater’s motions, arguing that the Plaintiffs have \n                                                 \n1 Section 3604(a) makes it unlawful to “make unavailable or deny” housing to any person because of \nrace.  42 U.S.C. § 3604(a).  Section 3605(a) makes it unlawful to discriminate on the basis of race in the \navailability, terms, or conditions of residential real estate-related transactions.  Id. § 3605(a).  And \n§ 3608(e)(5) of Title VIII requires HUD and recipients of federal funds to “administer the programs and \nactivities relating to housing and urban development in a manner affirmatively to further” fair housing.  \nId. § 3608(e)(5).  Finally, § 5304(b)(2) of the HCDA requires that the use of all CDBG funds be \nconducted in a manner that “affirmatively further[s] fair housing.”  Id. § 5304(b)(2).   \n  2 \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 50-1    Filed 06/02/10   Page 10 of 51\n \na right to sue Rainwater under the doctrine of Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), Rainwater’s \nsovereign immunity defense is meritless, and the action should not be transferred.  Dkt. No. 33.  \nOn July 8, 2009, Rainwater and HUD filed reply briefs in support of their respective motions.  \nDkt. Nos. 38-40.   \nOn March 3, 2010, the Court denied the Plaintiffs’ July 23, 2009 request for an oral \nhearing on the pending motions.  See Minute Order of Judge Henry H. Kennedy, Jr. (Mar. 3, \n2010); Dkt. No. 41.  However, on May 24, 2010, the Court scheduled a hearing for June 4, 2010, \nat 3:00 p.m., and directed the parties to address (1) whether Ex Parte Young permits an order \nprecluding a state officer from using funds that have not yet been released in a manner that \nviolates federal law, and (2) how much money is available to the Road Home program but has \nnot yet been disbursed to Louisiana for that use, and how much money Louisiana and/or the \nLRA have that has not yet been disbursed to Road Home recipients.  Dkt. No. 45.   \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nA.  Congress Responded to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita by Funding the Largest \nEmergency Housing Program in American History, and Required States Spending \nthe Funds to Follow Federal Non-Discrimination and Fair Housing Requirements   \n \nIn the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, Congress established a $19.7 \nbillion Disaster Recovery Grant program.  To support that program, Congress allocated \nCommunity Development Block Grant (“CDBG”) funds for necessary expenses related to \ndisaster relief, long-term recovery, and rebuilding in the most affected areas in the Gulf of \nMexico.2  Congress created and funded the Disaster Recovery Grant program through three \n                                                 \n2 See Department of Defense, Emergency Supplemental Appropriations to Address Hurricanes in the \nGulf of Mexico, and Pandemic Influenza Act, 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-148, 119 Stat. 2680, 2779-81 (Dec. \n30, 2005) (the “2005 Act”) (Ex. A); Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global \nWar on Terror, and Hurricane Recovery, 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-234, 120 Stat. 418, 472-73 (June 15, \n2006) (the “2006 Act”) (Ex. B); Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-116, \n  3 \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 50-1    Filed 06/02/10   Page 11 of 51\n \nappropriation statutes passed in 2005, 2006, and 2007.  The first two statutes appropriated a \ncombined $16.7 billion to the five affected states—Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, Florida, and \nAlabama—for activities authorized under the CDBG statute.  See 2005 Act, 119 Stat. at 2779-81 \n($11.5 billion appropriation); 2006 Act, 120 Stat. at 472-73 ($5.2 billion appropriation).   \nFrom the overall $16.7 billion appropriation in the 2005 and 2006 Acts, HUD allocated \n$10.41 billion to Louisiana for disaster recovery expenses.3  Congress passed the third \nappropriations statute in late 2007, authorizing an additional $3 billion for supplemental CDBG \ngrants to Louisiana “solely for the purpose of covering costs associated with otherwise \ncompensated but eligible claims that were filed on or before July 31, 2007, under the Road Home \nprogram”—the program at issue in this litigation.  2007 Act, 121 Stat. at 1343-44.  Thus, $13.41 \nbillion of the total amount appropriated by Congress for the CDBG Disaster Recovery Grant \nprogram has been allocated to Louisiana.   \nThe Disaster Recovery Grant program is governed by the same statutory and regulatory \nframework that governs regular CDBG funds.4  See 2005 Act, 119 Stat. at 2779-80; 2006 Act, \n120 Stat. at 472-73.  Congress granted HUD limited authority to waive certain CDBG program \nrequirements if requested by a state, but Congress expressly retained the standard restrictions on \n                                                                                                                                                             \n121 Stat. 1295, 1343-44 (Nov. 13, 2007) (the “2007 Act”) (Ex. C).  For the Court’s convenience, the \nrelevant CDBG Disaster Recovery Grant statutes and regulations are attached as exhibits A through F. \n \n3 See 71 Fed. Reg. 7666, 7666 (Feb. 13, 2006) (Ex. D) (allocating $6.21 billion of the $11.5 billion \nfrom the 2005 Act to Louisiana); 71 Fed. Reg. 63,337, 63,338 (Oct. 30, 2006) (Ex. E) (allocating $4.2 \nbillion of the $5.2 billion from the 2006 Act to Louisiana).   \n \n4 The regular CDBG program provides annual block grants to local and state governments for housing \nand housing-related development activities.  42 U.S.C. § 5301.  The primary objective of the CDBG \nprogram is to develop “viable urban communities[] by providing decent housing and a suitable living \nenvironment and expanding economic opportunities, principally for persons of low and moderate \nincome.”  Id. § 5301(c).  The statutory requirements for the regular CDBG program are established in \nTitle I of the HCDA.  Id. §§ 5301-5318. \n  4 \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 50-1    Filed 06/02/10   Page 12 of 51\n \nthe use of CDBG funds related to fair housing, nondiscrimination, labor standards, and the \nenvironment, and HUD may not waive them.  See 2005 Act, 119 Stat. at 2780; 2006 Act, 120 \nStat. at 472-73.  \nThe appropriation statutes include a reporting and monitoring framework that \nsupplements the regular CDBG program requirements.  The 2005 and 2006 Acts provide that \n“prior to the obligation of funds each State shall submit a plan to the Secretary [of HUD] \ndetailing the proposed use of all funds, including criteria for eligibility and how the proposed use \nof all funds . . . will address long-term recovery and restoration of infrastructure.”  2005 Act, 119 \nStat. at 2780; 2006 Act, 120 Stat. at 473; see also 42 U.S.C. § 5304(a)(1).  HUD’s implementing \nregulations require that grantees submit an “action plan” to fulfill this obligation.  See 71 Fed. \nReg. at 7669; 71 Fed. Reg. at 63,338-39; 72 Fed. Reg. 70,472, 70,472-73 (Dec. 11, 2007) \n(Ex. F).  In addition to detailing the intended uses of all grant funds, the action plan must include \na number of certifications,5 including assurances that the grantee will comply with the Fair \nHousing Act and will affirmatively further fair housing.  71 Fed. Reg. at 7671; 71 Fed. Reg. at \n63,339; 72 Fed. Reg. at 70,472.  HUD is required to review and approve these certifications \nbefore it obligates any grant funds.  42 U.S.C. § 5304(b). \nB.  Louisiana Has Spent Approximately $11 Billion of the Recovery Funds on the Road \nHome Program to Assist Homeowners With Repairing and Rebuilding Their \nHomes, But Applies a HUD-Approved Formula That Adversely Impacts African \nAmerican Homeowners  \n \nTo administer the recovery funds from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, including CDBG \nDisaster Recovery Grant funds, Louisiana created the LRA.  LRA Strategic Plan FY 2008/2009 \n                                                 \n5 “Certification” is defined in HUD regulations to mean: “A written assertion, based on supporting \nevidence, that must be kept available for inspection by HUD, by the Inspector General of HUD, and by \nthe public.”  24 C.F.R. § 91.5. \n  5 \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 50-1    Filed 06/02/10   Page 13 of 51\n \nat 1 (Ex. G).  The LRA “was created by Executive Order in 2005 and in statute through Act 5 of \nthe 2006 1st Extraordinary Session of the Louisiana Legislature. The organizational sunset date \nof the agency is July 1st, 2010, unless further extended by the Legislature.”  Id.  At the inception \nof this action, Paul Rainwater was the LRA’s Executive Director.  See Compl. ¶ 19.  As of \nJanuary 1, 2010, Robin Keegan replaced Rainwater as the Executive Director of the LRA.  See \nLouisiana Recovery Authority, Rainwater Joins Governor’s Staff, Keegan Named LRA \nExecutive Director (Dec. 29, 2009) (Ex. H); Biography of Robin Keegan (Ex. I).6   \nFrom a total of over $13 billion in Disaster Recovery Grant funds, the LRA designated \nnearly $12 billion for housing programs known collectively as the Road Home program.  See \nLRA Recovery Budget and Program Updates, Robin Keegan, at 1 (May 10, 2010) (“May 2010 \nLRA Budget Update”) (Ex. J).  The largest Road Home component is the Homeowner \nAssistance Program,7 which provides rebuilding assistance to homeowners whose homes were \ndestroyed or suffered major damage as a result of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.  See id. at 1-2 \n(stating that $10.348 billion of the total LRA budget of $13.781 billion has been obligated to the \nHomeowner Assistance Program, compared to $1.303 billion for rental assistance); The Road \nHome, Overview of the Homeowner Program (Ex. K). \nHomeowners who agree to use Road Home funds to rebuild or repair their homes are \neligible for rebuilding grants of up to $150,000.  The Road Home Homeowner Program Policies, \nVersion 3.4 (Mar. 15, 2007) at 12 (Ex. L).  The formula for computing the grants, which was \nadopted by LRA and approved by HUD, provides that the grant amount is the lower of two \n                                                 \n6 For the purposes of this Motion, the Plaintiffs will refer interchangeably to Rainwater and the \nLRA’s Executive Director. \n \n7 Unless otherwise specified, this memorandum will refer to the Road Home Homeowner Assistance \nProgram as the “Road Home” program for brevity. \n  6 \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 50-1    Filed 06/02/10   Page 14 of 51\n \nvalues: (1) the home’s pre-storm value (minus any other compensation the applicant received for \nloss to the structure, such as insurance proceeds), or (2) the cost of repairing damage to the home \n(minus any other compensation the applicant received for loss to the structure).  Id.  Hereinafter, \nthe Plaintiffs refer interchangeably to the cost of repairing damage, the cost of damage, and the \nestimated cost of damage.  In May 2007, individuals with incomes at or below 80 percent of the \narea median income became eligible for an Additional Compensation Grant of up to $50,000.  \nLRA Action Plan Amendment 14 (First Allocation) – Road Home Homeowner Compensation \nPlan (May 14, 2007) at 7 (Ex. M).   \nConsistent with the statutory and regulatory framework described above, the LRA \nproposed and developed the Road Home grant formula and the details of the Road Home \nprogram in consultation with HUD and subject to HUD’s ongoing approval and oversight.  See \nTestimony of Paul Rainwater, Executive Director of the LRA, Before the U.S. Subcommittee on \nHousing and Community Opportunity (Aug. 20, 2009) at 87 (Ex. N) (stating that HUD had \napproved “two overarching Action Plans” and “Louisiana ha[d] presented” 45 amendments to \nHUD “to clarify programmatic rules and outline additional uses of funds”); State of Louisiana \nOffice of Community Development Disaster Recovery Unit (Ex. O) (listing action plans and \namendments approved and rejected by HUD).    \nAs the Plaintiffs alleged in their Complaint and document below, the requirement that the \nRoad Home grant not exceed the pre-storm value of the home has had a disparate impact on \nAfrican Americans.  Pl’s Complaint ¶¶ 52-60 (Dkt. 1).  Because homes in predominantly African \nAmerican communities had lower pre-storm values than comparable homes in predominantly \nWhite communities, and the Road Home program provides a grant based on the lesser of the pre-\nstorm value or the cost of repairing damage, African Americans have been more likely than \n  7 \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 50-1    Filed 06/02/10   Page 15 of 51\n \nWhites to receive a Road Home grant based on the pre-storm value of their home rather than on \nthe higher cost of repairing damage.  Id. ¶¶ 52-55.  As a result, African American homeowners are \nmore likely than White homeowners to have a gap between their rebuilding resources and the cost \nto rebuild and, on average, their gaps are larger.  Id. ¶¶ 55-57.  \nC.  The Road Home Program Grant Formula Has Had a Disparate Impact on African \nAmerican Home Owners  \n \nNotwithstanding that the Plaintiffs have yet to conduct discovery in this action, evidence \nfrom publicly-available sources reveals that the Road Home program’s grant formula has had an \nadverse impact on African American homeowners in New Orleans.  First, homes in African \nAmerican communities have lower values than homes in predominantly White communities.  \nSecond, by linking the amount of the grant award to the pre-storm home value, the Road Home \nformula ensures that African Americans are more likely than Whites to receive grants based on a \nlow pre-storm home value and face larger gaps between the cost of repairing their homes and \ntheir Road Home grants. \ni.  Homes in Predominantly African American Communities Have Lower Values \nThan Homes in Predominantly White Communities  \n \nBoth statistical and testimonial evidence demonstrate that African Americans in New \nOrleans are much more likely than Whites to own homes with lower values, even when the \nhomes are comparable.  First, U.S. Census data shows that before the storm, 80% of African \nAmerican homeowners in New Orleans owned homes worth less than $100,000, compared to \n33% of White homeowners; 89% of African American homeowners owned homes worth less \nthan $125,000, compared to 44% of White homeowners; and 93% of African American \nhomeowners owned homes worth less than $150,000, compared to 55% of White homeowners.  \n  8 \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 50-1    Filed 06/02/10   Page 16 of 51\n \nPercentage of African American and White Homeowners Who Own Homes Less Than \n$100,000, $125,000 and $150,000 in Orleans Parish (Ex.

See African American Homeowners and Home Values \nby Census Tract, Orleans Parish (Ex. Q). The disparities in pre-storm home values between \npredominantly African American and predominantly White communities can be discerned even \nmore clearly from a map of New Orleans reporting for each Census tract the median home value \nand the percentage of African American owner-occupied homes.  African American Percentage \nof Owner Occupied Homes and Median Home Values in Orleans Parish (Ex. R) (applying the \nsame 2000 Census data).  The map paints a stark picture: almost none of the Census tracts where \nAfrican Americans own 60% or more of the homes has a median home value of $150,000 or \n  9 \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 50-1    Filed 06/02/10   Page 17 of 51\n \nmore, whereas the vast majority of Census Tracts where Whites own 80% or more of the homes \nhave median home values between $150,000 and $300,000, or $300,000 to $500,000.  Id.  \nSimilarly, while almost none of the Census tracts where Whites own 80% or more of the homes \nhas a median home value less than $100,000, almost all Census Tracts where African Americans \nown 60% or more of the homes have a median home value of less than $100,000.  Id.  \n  \nAccord  Kalima Rose, Annie Clark, & Dominique Duval-Diop, A Long Way Home: The State of \nHousing Recovery in Louisiana 2008 (“PolicyLink Study”), at 46, 49 (Ex. S) (reporting “average \npre-storm home value by block” in “select heavily damaged neighborhoods” in New Orleans, to \ndemonstrate how the “predominantly African-American neighborhoods” of “Gentilly, Lower 9th \nward, and New Orleans East had lower pre-storm value”).  \n  10 \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 50-1    Filed 06/02/10   Page 18 of 51\n \nThird, this statistical data is consistent with the first-hand observations of local real estate \nprofessionals and public officials who recognized that homes values in predominantly African \nAmerican neighborhoods were typically much lower than home values in predominantly White \nneighborhoods.  See Affidavit of Carol George Johnson, Owner and President of Johnson \nMortgage Company ¶¶ 2, 5 (June 1, 2010) (Ex. T) (noting that her “chief responsibility is \ndetermining feasibility of mortgage loans based on . . . the market values of assets,” that she \nevaluates appraisals, and that her company “has originated more than 7,500 home mortgage \nloans for first time-homeowners”).  Based on nearly two decades of experience as a lender and \nher public service as the Executive Director of the Finance Authority of New Orleans, Ms. \nJohnson “observed that pre-Katrina homes in predominantly African American neighborhoods \nwere valued less than comparably sized homes in predominantly White neighborhoods.”  Id. ¶ 6. \nii.  As African Americans Own Homes With Lower Values, They Are More Likely \nThan Whites to Receive Rebuilding Grants Based on Low Pre-Storm Values and \nHave Larger Gaps in Their Rebuilding Resources  \n \nAs a consequence of this phenomenon that homes in predominantly African American \nneighborhoods were worth less than homes in predominantly White neighborhoods, the Road \nHome grant formula adopted by LRA and approved by HUD resulted in African Americans  \nbeing more likely than Whites to receive grant awards based on lower pre-storm values and, as a \nresult, being more likely to confront costs of rebuilding their homes that exceed the size of their \nRoad Home grants (and other resources, such as insurance proceeds).  See The Road Home \nHomeowner Program Policies 3.4 at 12 (Ex. L).   \nFirst, the results of a study conducted in 2008 by PolicyLink, a national independent \nresearch organization, confirm that gaps between the amounts of Road Home program grants and \n  11 \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 50-1    Filed 06/02/10   Page 19 of 51\n \nthe costs to rebuild homes are more frequent and larger for African American than for White \nhome owners in Louisiana.  The study reported that:      \nNearly three-fourths of Road Home applicants had gaps between their rebuilding \nresources and the cost to rebuild.  The gap was larger for African American \napplicants [$39,082 on average] than their white counterparts [$30,863]. . . .  The \ngrant formula had a more negative effect on those whose homes were valued less \nthan their damage estimates.  Those whose damages were greater than their pre-\nstorm home value—46.7% of all applicants rebuilding in place—experienced a \ngap of nearly $50,000.  All the rest had a much lower gap—an average of about \n$14,000 (53.3% of all applicants rebuilding in place).    \n \nPolicyLink Study at 42-43 (Ex. S).  \nThese disparities are most pronounced in New Orleans, where there are especially large \ndifferences in the value of homes located in predominantly African American and White \nneighborhoods.  See id. at 42, 47, 49 (reporting large disparities in property values, grant awards, \nand gaps between the cost to rebuild homes and awards received for that purpose, finding “New \nOrleans’ Road Home applicants are more likely to have a gap than all applicants statewide,” and \nthe average rebuilding gap was $55,000 in New Orleans compared to about $36,000 statewide).   \nFor instance, in the Lower 9th Ward, a predominantly African American neighborhood in \nNew Orleans, the average pre-storm home value was $100,739, the average Road Home grant \nwas $93,401, and the average gap between the cost to rebuild homes and the funds awarded for \nthat purpose was $75,355  In the predominantly White New Orleans neighborhood of Lakeview, \nthe average pre-storm home value was $336,064, the average Road Home grant was $109,777, \nand the average gap between the cost to rebuild homes and the amount of funds awarded to do so \nwas $44,405.  Id.  And while 66.1% of the Lower 9th Ward applicants faced gaps of more than \n$40,000, only 35.2% of Lakeview applicants faced a gap of the same magnitude.  Id. at 48.

For example, Ms. Carol George \nJohnson, an owner of a mortgage company, who has handled property sales and valuations in \nNew Orleans for nearly 20 years, attests that “because of the formula employed . . . homeowners \nin predominantly African American areas receive[d] lower grant awards than homeowners in \npredominantly White areas.”  Johnson Aff. ¶¶ 5, 7.      \nAccounts from the named plaintiffs illustrate, in greater detail, the adverse effect of the \nRoad Home program grant formula on African American homeowners.     \nAlmarie Ford is an African American resident of Orleans Parish who, since 1988, has \nowned a home at 7071 Ridgefield Dr., New Orleans.  Her home was “completely destroyed” by \nHurricane Katrina, making it uninhabitable and forcing her to rent an apartment in Baton Rouge \nfor two years while she continued to pay the mortgage on her home.  Affidavit of Almarie Ford \n¶¶ 1-3, 5 (May 24, 2010) (Ex. U).  Although Ms. Ford received over $146,000 in insurance \nproceeds, she faced over $297,000 in rebuilding costs.  Id. ¶¶ 4-5.

Id. ¶ 5.  LRA also required Ms. Ford to assign to it \nthe proceeds from a small settlement with State Farm Insurance, “leaving [her] with a grant of \nonly $1,399.46.”  Id. ¶ 5.  As Ms. Ford explains:    \nI have been living in my property since September 2008, but repairs are not \ncompleted, because I did not receive enough money from the Road Home \nProgram or insurance to complete repairs.  The exterior of my house still requires \npainting, and storm shutters, and the interior requires finishing work. I had to \nspend $35,000 of my own funds and take out a SBA loan for $54,000 to repair the \nhome, but the repairs are still not finished.  I currently still owe $22,173.01 on the \nSBA loan.  My mortgage company Wells Fargo Home Mortgage will not release \nthe remaining balance of insurance funds until repairs are completed, but I cannot \nfinish repairs because I have no money available. \n \nId. ¶ 6.    \nEdward Randolph is an African American resident of Orleans Parish who, since 2000, \nhas owned a “duplex” at 8851-8853 Gervais St., New Orleans, 70127, half of which he rented \nout prior to Hurricane Katrina.  Affidavit of Edward Randolph ¶¶ 1-2 (May 24, 2010) (Ex. V).   \nMr. Randolph’s home suffered more than $308,193 in rebuilding costs.  Id. ¶ 6.

I was able to move back \ninto my house in December 2009, after renting an apartment in Luling, Louisiana, \n25 miles upriver of New Orleans.  During this time, I had to pay rent and my \nmortgage, and almost lost my house twice to foreclosure because I was unable to \nafford both of these responsibilities.  I am still unable to rent the other side of my \nhouse, and all repairs are not yet completed.  \n  14 \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 50-1    Filed 06/02/10   Page 22 of 51\n \n \nId. ¶¶ 6-7.

Ford Aff. ¶ 5;   \n \nRandolph Aff. ¶ 5.   \n \nD.  The LRA Executive Director Admits That the Road Home Grant Formula Has \nAdversely Affected African American Homeowners \n \nIn August, 2009, the House Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity8  \nheld a hearing on the administration of the Road Home program and the extent to which it has \noperated adversely to African American home owners.  At that hearing, in his capacity as \nExecutive Director of the LRA, Rainwater admitted that the Road Home program had produced \nan adverse effect on African American homeowners.  Field Hearing Before the Subcommittee on \nHousing and Community Opportunity of the Committee on Financial Services, Implementation \nof the Road Home Program Four Years After Hurricane Katrina (Aug. 20, 2009), Ser. No. 111-\n70, at 23 (Ex N) (“Hearing Transcript”), at 23-24, available at \nhttp://www.house.gov/apps/list/hearing/financialsvcs_dem/hrhus_082009.shtml.   \nIn his testimony, Rainwater confirmed that the Road Home grant formula has had an \nadverse effect on African American homeowners.  First, Rainwater agreed that “home values in \npredominantly African American neighborhoods tend to be lower than values in similar houses \nin predominantly white neighborhoods.” Id. at 23; see also id. at 18 (Rainwater stating that the \nadditional compensation grant was created because assessments in “parts of New Orleans were \n                                                 \n8 The House Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity has jurisdiction over HUD and \nits implementation of the Road Home program.  See House Committee on Financial Services, \nCommittee/Subcommittee Jurisdiction: Housing and Community Opportunity (Ex. W) (“The Housing \nand Community Opportunity subcommittee . . . oversees the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment . . . . The subcommittee also handles matters related to public, affordable, and rural housing, \nas well as community development . . . .”).   \n  15 \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 50-1    Filed 06/02/10   Page 23 of 51\n \nlower than other parts, like Lakeview”).  Next, when asked whether it is “true that African-\nAmerican homeowners are more likely to receive what is called the pre-storm value for their \nhomes by virtue of the [] methodologies that you use to compute values—is it true that they are \nmore likely to receive the pre-storm value as opposed to the actual cost to repair value,” \nRainwater agreed, “Yes sir, I am sure it is. . . . I do not deny that.”  Id. at 23-24.  \n Rainwater also admitted that most low-income homeowners lack the resources to rebuild \ntheir damaged homes, agreeing that low-income homeowners “9 times out of 10, they cannot \nsave the money or have the money by which to get these homes [repaired].” Id. at 17.  Overall, \nRainwater disclosed, the Road Home grant formula had left a gap between the cost of rebuilding \nhomes in New Orleans and the grant funds available for that purpose.  As he explained, LRA’s \n“analysis showed a gap in homeowner rebuilding resources available in the city of New Orleans, \nof between $1.6 billion and $2.3 billion. . . .  Many low-to-moderate income homeowners may \nnot have the resources to build their homes with the funds available.”  See id. at 90.   \nE.  More than $500 Million in Road Home Monies Are Needed to Fund the Road Home \nGrants Recalculated Through Use of a Non-Discriminatory Formula  \n \nAlthough the Plaintiffs lack access to LRA’s current program data, publicly available \ninformation reveals  that the cost of recalculating Road Home grants in Orleans Parish, based on \na  formula with no adverse impact, is estimated to exceed $500 million.   \nThe computation of this estimate is straightforward.  The starting point is 41,419, the \nnumber of Road Home grant recipients in Orleans Parish who have received rebuilding grants \nunder Option 1.  See State of Louisiana, Office of Community Development, The Homeowner \nAssistance Program Week 201 Situation & Pipeline Report (May 11, 2010) at 17 (Ex. X).  Next, \nthis number is multiplied by 46.7% to reflect the percentage of recipients who received a grant \n  16 \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 50-1    Filed 06/02/10   Page 24 of 51\n \nbased on pre-storm home value, resulting in 19,343 residents of Orleans Parish who are \nestimated to have received grants based on the pre-storm value of their homes.  (These \nindividuals would receive higher rebuilding grants under a grant formula based on the cost of \nrepair).  PolicyLink Study at 43 (Ex. N).  This number is again multiplied, this time by 48.9%, \nthe percentage of recipients who have incomes above 80% of the area median income, id. at 37, \nas they were ineligible for the Additional Compensation Grant, which was initially limited to \n$50,000 but today is limited only by the full cost of repair.9  Thus, 9,459 recipients in Orleans \nParish would be expected to benefit from a recalculated grant formula.  Finally, to estimate the \ncost of funding the difference between the old grants and the recalculated grants for 9,459 \nrecipients in Orleans Parish, their number is multiplied by the average gap of $54, 586 between \nthe grants awarded and the cost of repairing homes in New Orleans.  Id. at 47.  The ensuing \nestimate of the additional monies needed to fund recalculated Road Home grants for Orleans \nParish residents is $516 million. \nF.  LRA Has Announced Plans That, in the Near Future, Would Deprive the Plaintiffs \nof Their Ability to Obtain Equitable Relief in This Action \n \nSince 2009, the LRA has taken action to obligate large portions of the remaining federal \nemergency CDBG funds that HUD has provided for the Road Home Homeowner Assistance \nprogram.  And now, with less than a month before the LRA is scheduled to dissolve \n                                                 \n9 Last year, the LRA amended its formula to remove the $50,000 cap on the Additional \nCompensation Grant.  LRA Proposed Action Plan Amendment 39, Removal of Affordable Compensation \nGrant Cap (Oct. 12, 2009) at 1 (Ex. Y).  As a result, Road Home grant recipients with incomes at or \nbelow 80% of the area median income should be entitled to a grant based on the full cost of repair.  \nAccordingly, it does not appear that these low-income individuals would receive a higher grant award if \nthe Court orders the LRA to implement a non-discriminatory formula based on the cost of repair. \n \n  17 \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 50-1    Filed 06/02/10   Page 25 of 51\n \norganizationally,10 the LRA has announced plans to direct how the $148 million in remaining \nRoad Home funds it possesses should be expended by whatever organization assumes its duties.  \nSee generally Proposed Action Plan Amendment No. 43 (Third Appropriation) – Homeowner \nUnmet Recovery Needs Program To be Submitted for LRA Approval: May 19, 2010 (Apr. 28, \n2010) (Ex. aa) (“Action Plan Amendment 43”).  Equally critical, only $500 million in \nunobligated funds remain with HUD from the third appropriation that Congress earmarked for \nthe Road Home program.  And it isn’t even clear that, were the Court to grant the relief \nrequested, this $500 million could be used entirely to fund the recalculated Road Home grants, as \nHUD may be required to direct a portion of this fund to defray expenses incurred by the LRA or \nLouisiana under Options 2 and 3 of the Road Home program, as well as expenses for compliance \nand assurance.   See Affidavit of Peter Romer-Friedman ¶ 5 (June 2, 2010) (Ex. bb). \nIt should be clear, therefore, that in the very near future, there will be insufficient monies \nremaining to fund the equitable remedy the Plaintiffs seek.  As the remaining funds that HUD \nand LRA together have in their custody are approximately $648 million, assuming none of those \nmonies has already been committed for other purposes, there are scarcely sufficient monies \nremaining in the Road Home Program to permit funding of the grants to Orleans Parish residents \nrecomputed through use of a non-discriminatory formula.  Any further commitment of the \nremaining Road Home monies would forever deny the Plaintiffs an opportunity to obtain a full \nequitable remedy in this action.  \ni.   LRA’s Recent Actions Reduced its Remaining Road Home Funds to $148 Million \nWhile the LRA has taken a number of steps to obligate its remaining Road Home funds, \nby far the LRA’s most significant action was removing the $50,000 cap on the Additional \n                                                 \n10 By statute, the LRA Board will sunset on June 30, 2010.  See Louisiana Recovery Authority, \nResolution to Approve Strategic Allocation of Remaining Unspent Funds (May 17, 2010) at 2 (Ex. Z).  \n  18 \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 50-1    Filed 06/02/10   Page 26 of 51\n \nCompensation Grants (“ACG”) given to homeowners with incomes at or below 80% of the area \nmedian income.  See LRA Proposed Action Plan Amendment 39, Removal of Affordable \nCompensation Grant Cap (Oct. 12, 2009) (Ex. Y); Letter from Yolanda Chavez, Deputy \nAssistant Secretary for Grant Programs, to Paul Rainwater (Oct. 14, 2009) (“HUD Letter”) (Ex. \ncc) (acknowledging LRA’s action plan amendment to “remove[e] the $50,000 cap for [ACGs] to \nprovide these low- to moderate-income homeowners with additional resources needed to recover \nfrom Hurricanes Katrina and Rita”).  Both Rainwater and HUD described removing the ACG \ncap as an effort to assist low-income homeowners who received low Road Home grants based on \npre-storm homes values and, thus, faced large gaps in rebuilding costs that prevented them from \nrealizing the program’s benefits.11   \nAlthough removing the ACG cap provided important assistance to thousands of very low-\nincome homeowners, including some members of the proposed Plaintiff class, it did not address \nthe gaps that many moderate-income African American homeowners continue to face.  \nRemoving the cap did nothing to supplement the grants of homeowners whose incomes exceed \n80 percent of the area median income.  See, e.g., LRA Plan Amendment 39, at 1-2; Ford Aff. ¶ 5 \n(Ex. U) (stating that she was not eligible for a ACG and received a grant of $1,399); Randolph \nAff. ¶¶ 5-6 (Ex. V) (stating that because he received a grant of $16,649 he is still “short \n                                                 \n11 See id.; Testimony of Paul Rainwater, Hearing Transcript at 11-12 (Ex.

The aim is to help people who had homes of modest value.  Because the original grants \nwere based on a home’s pre-storm value, in many cases they did not cover the cost of rebuilding.  That \nwas especially true in poorer neighborhoods, which have lower property values.”).  Accordingly, both \nHUD and LRA acknowledged that their formula adversely impacted residents with more modest homes, \nwho are disproportionately African-American.  Absent any recognition that HUD had approved the \nformula that created the disparities in the first place, HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan hailed the removal \nof the ACG cap as “a good example of HUD’s willingness to alter ‘barriers that hamper recovery.’”  Oct. \n16, 2009 Times Picayune Article, at 1 (Ex. dd) (quoting Secretary Donovan).    \n    \n  19 \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 50-1    Filed 06/02/10   Page 27 of 51\n \n$173,193 needed to rebuild”).12  Moreover, it reduced the LRA’s remaining Road Home program \nfunds by $317 million to a total of $148 million.  May 2010 LRA Budget Update at 2 (Ex. J).  \nii.   The LRA Intends to Obligate the $148 Million of Remaining Funds Very Soon  \n \nWith only $148 million remaining in unobligated Road Home Homeowner Assistance \nfunds, id., the LRA intends to obligate most, if not all, of the remaining funds it possesses by \npassing a $100 million-plus Action Plan Amendment (No. 43) to transform the remainder of the  \nRoad Home program from a grant program into a “construction lending program.”  Action Plan \nAmendment 43 at 2 (Ex. aa).13   Amendment 43 would provide loans to homeowners who \nalready received Road Home grants, but “have not yet been able to reoccupy their pre-storm \ndwelling due to unmet recovery needs.”  Id.   \nLast week, the LRA informed the Plaintiffs that it intends to approve the lending program \nas Action Plan Amendment 43 at its final board meeting in June before LRA dissolves, and then \nseveral other state bodies would pass the Amendment before its submission to HUD for \napproval.  Romer-Friedman Aff. ¶¶ 4-5 (Ex. bb).  Once LRA’s Board approves Amendment 43 \n(or any other amendment), it could be presented to HUD within about 8 days, as the only waiting \nperiod for action that state law imposes is a seven day period between approval by LRA and \napproval by a legislative body.  See La. Rev. Stat. § 49:220.5(G)(4) (2010).  Therefore, if LRA \napproves Amendment 43 on June 24, it could seek HUD’s approval by early- to mid-July.  And \n                                                 \n12 Indeed, only 42% of Road Home applicants have incomes at or below 80 percent of the area \nmedian income to qualify for an ACG.  PolicyLink Study at 37 (Ex. S).  Nor did removing the ACG cap \ncorrect the discriminatory formula that created the sizable gaps in the first instance.  \n \n13 To justify no longer providing rebuilding grants that need not be repaid and instead offering \nloans that must be repaid to private financial institutions, the LRA states that (1) despite Road Home \nprogram assistance, “20,000 households statewide . . . will not be able to rebuild and reoccupy their \nhomes,” and (2) there will be thousands of homeowners who require additional financial assistance, \nespecially in the current recession where construction lending has been significantly reduced.”  Id. at 1. \n    \n  20 \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 50-1    Filed 06/02/10   Page 28 of 51\n \nwhile HUD has 45 days to review and approve any Action Plan Amendment, HUD can approve \nthe amendment immediately.  24 C.F.R. § 91.500.  Accordingly, based on the schedule currently \nin place, LRA’s lending program will be ready for HUD approval in July or, at the latest, in \nAugust and can be implemented immediately thereafter.  LRA, however, has the discretion to \naccelerate this process by moving its Board meeting to an earlier date, as long it provides public \nnotice 24 hours in advance,14 in which case HUD could approve this amendment as early as mid-\nJune, 2010.  Once LRA proposes and HUD approves an amendment obligating LRA’s remaining \nRoad Home funds, these monies will become unavailable to fund an equitable remedy in this \naction. \niii.  LRA May Also Request that HUD Disburse the $500 Million That Remains from \nthe Road Home Appropriation, Jeopardizing the Availability of These Monies to \nFund Recalculated Road Home Program Grants  \n \nIn addition to obligating the money it currently possesses, the LRA may also request that \nHUD obligate, award, and disperse the remaining $500 million that HUD has in unobligated \nfederal Road Home funds from the third Congerssional appropriation.  See 2007 Act, 121 Stat. at \n1343; Romer-Friedman Aff. ¶ 5 (Ex. bb).  Since the LRA can make such a request in the same \ntimeframe as it approves and submits Amendment 43 to HUD, there is a direct and immediate \nthreat to the remaining $500 million that would otherwise be available to fund recalculated \ngrants, should the Plaintiffs prevail in this action. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \n  “‘The purpose of a preliminary injunction is merely to preserve the relative positions of \nthe parties until a trial on the merits can be held.’”  Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. \n                                                 \n14 See La.

And within days or weeks, the \nLRA will obligate most or all of the remaining $148 million it possesses and also ask HUD to \nobligate and disburse the remaining $500 million in Road Home funds in HUD’s custody.  If \neven a significant portion of these funds are obligated for a purpose other than relief in this \naction, it will forever deny the Plaintiffs an opportunity to obtain the full equitable relief they \nseek – the recalculation of Road Home grant awards in Orleans Parish on a non-discriminatory \nbasis.   \nUnder these circumstances and particularly when government funds are at stake, courts \nroutinely freeze disputed assets in order to preserve the status quo pending resolution of the \nlitigation.  In fact, the only unique or novel aspect of the Plaintiffs’ motion is that one Defendant, \nthe LRA’s Executive Director Paul Rainwater, has actually conceded the merits of Plaintiffs’ \ndisparate impact claim.   \nThe Plaintiffs can easily satisfy each part of the four-part balancing test to obtain a \npreliminary injunction.  First, it is undisputable that the Plaintiffs will lack an adequate remedy \nto the discrimination they suffered if the LRA is permitted to further obligate and spend the \n  23 \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 50-1    Filed 06/02/10   Page 31 of 51\n \nremaining Road Home funds.  Next, there will be no harm to the Defendants by temporarily \nfreezing the remaining Road Home funds, and other interested parties will actually benefit from \nthe preliminary relief the Plaintiffs seek, as existing Road Home applicants would receive grants \ninstead of loans under the LRA’s proposed lending program.    \nFinally, the public interest strongly supports the issuance of a preliminary relief, because \nan injunction will preserve the opportunity of the Plaintiffs and this Court to vindicate the civil \nrights of homeowners who are victims of discrimination in the nation’s largest federal \nemergency housing program, a program to which Congress specifically attached fair housing and \nnon-discrimination protections.    \nARGUMENT \nThe Plaintiffs Are Entitled to a Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary \nInjunction Barring the Executive Director of LRA or a Successor From Obligating \nand/or Spending Any Funds Available for Relief in This Action, or Seeking From \nHUD the Further Obligation and/or Disbursement of Any Such Funds    \n \nA.  The Plaintiffs Have a Substantial Likelihood of Success on the Merits  \n  As the Plaintiffs have marshaled substantial evidence about how and why the Road Home \nProgram grant formula has had a disparate impact on African American homeowners, the \nPlaintiffs have a very high likelihood of succeeding in their disparate impact claim.   \nTo determine the Plaintiffs’ likelihood of success, this Court should apply the burden-\nshifting framework that a number of Circuits have adopted to adjudicate FHA disparate impact \nclaims, drawing on Title VII jurisprudence.  See Huntington Branch, NAACP v. Town of \nHuntington, 844 F.2d 926, 935-36 (2d Cir. 1988) (adopting the burden shifting framework); see \nalso Nat’l Fair Housing Alliance v. The Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 208 F. Supp. 2d 46, 60 \n(D.D.C. 2002) (“Courts have applied the basic burden-shifting scheme used to review disparate \n  24 \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 50-1    Filed 06/02/10   Page 32 of 51\n \nimpact claims brought under Title VII . . . to disparate impact claims brought pursuant to the \nFHA.”) (citations omitted).   \nThe Second Circuit and “several [other] circuits have adopted this burden-shifting \nframework,” 2922 Sherman Ave. Tenants Assoc. v. District of Columbia, 444 F.3d 673, 680 \n(D.C. Cir. 2006) (discussing competing approaches for adjudicating FHA disparate impact \nclaims, but declining to adopt a standard, as the plaintiffs could not satisfy either standard) \n(citing Darst-Webbe Tenant Ass’n Bd. v. St. Louis Hous. Auth., 417 F.3d 898, 901-02 (8th Cir. \n2005); Langlois v. Abington Hous. Auth., 207 F.3d 43, 51 (1st Cir. 2000)); see also Gamble v. \nCity of Escondido, 104 F.3d 300, 306 (9th Cir. 1997), which operates in the following manner:  \nIn order to make out a prima facie case under the FHA on a theory of disparate \nimpact, a plaintiff must demonstrate that an outwardly neutral practice actually \nor predictably has a discriminatory effect; that is, has a significantly adverse or \ndisproportionate impact on minorities, or perpetuates segregation. The plaintiff \nneed not make any showing of discriminatory intent, however.  The burden then \nshifts to a defendant to demonstrate that “its actions furthered . . . a legitimate, \nbona fide governmental interest and that no alternative would serve that interest \nwith less discriminatory effect.  \n \nFair Hous. in Huntington Comm. Inc. v. Town of Huntington, 316 F.3d 357, 366  (2d Cir. 2003) \n(citations and internal quotations omitted).15   \n                                                 \n15 In Metropolitan Housing Development Corporation v. Village of Arlington Heights, 558 F.2d \n1283 (7th Cir. 1977), the Seventh Circuit adopted an alternative four-part test that would consider, inter \nalia, “whether any evidence indicates discriminatory intent.”  Courts have vigorously rejected that test, \nhowever, as it “would place ‘too onerous a burden’ on plaintiffs to treat these four factors ‘as steps \nnecessary to make out a prima facie case’” 2922 Sherman Ave., 444 F.3d at 680 (quoting Town of \nHuntington, 844 F.2d at 935-36), and it would contravene the FHA’s stated purpose of ending \ndiscrimination.  See Pfaff v. HUD, 88 F.3d 739, 745-46 (9th Cir. 1996) (“we find no support for the \nproposition that a finding of intent is required to establish a prima facie case of disparate impact under the \nFHA”) (citing United States v. Yonkers Bd. of Educ., 837 F.2d 1181, 1217 (2d Cir. 1987) (“The consensus \nis that a plaintiff need prove only discriminatory effect, and need not show that the decision complained \nof was made with discriminatory intent.”); Town of Huntington, 844 F.2d at 934-35 (“The Act’s stated \npurpose to end discrimination requires a discriminatory effect standard; an intent requirement would strip \nthe statute of all impact on de facto segregation.”); United States v. City of Black Jack, 508 F.2d 1179, \n1185 (8th Cir. 1974) (“Effect, and not motivation, is the touchstone, in part because clever men may \neasily conceal their motivations, but more importantly, because . . . ‘we now firmly recognize that the \n  25 \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 50-1    Filed 06/02/10   Page 33 of 51\n \nThe Plaintiffs have a strong likelihood of prevailing under this burden-shifting \nframework.  At the outset, the Plaintiffs can demonstrate a prima facie case under the FHA, as \nthe statistical, documentary, and testimonial evidence in the record shows that the LRA’s \n“outwardly neutral practice” of using the pre-storm value to determine rebuilding grants, \n“actually or predictably has a discriminatory effect,” on African American homeowners in New \nOrleans; “that is, [it] has a significantly adverse or disproportionate impact.”  Huntington \nComm., 316 F.3d at 366.   \nFirst, homes in predominantly African American neighborhoods have lower values than \nhomes in predominantly White neighborhoods in New Orleans, even when the homes are \ncomparable.  African Americans are also more likely than Whites to own homes with lower \nvalues than Whites.  Indeed, the LRA’s Executive Director Paul Rainwater already conceded this \npoint by admitting to a Congressional panel that it is “true that home values in predominantly \nAfrican-American neighborhoods tend to be lower than values in similar houses in \npredominantly white neighborhoods.”  Hearing Transcript at 23 (Ex. N) (emphasis added).   \n  The following record evidence supports his observation:   \n•  U.S. Census Data shows nearly 80% of African American homeowners in New \nOrleans owned homes worth less than $100,000, compared to 33% of White \nhomeowners, and 93% of African American homeowners own homes worth less than \n$150,000, compared to 55% of White homeowners.  See Percentage of African \nAmerican and White Homeowners Who Own Homes Less Than $100,000, $125,000 \nand $150,000 in Orleans Parish (Ex. P).   \n \n•  U.S. Census data and an illustrative map show the median home value and percentage \nof African American owner occupied homes in each Census tract, and demonstrate \nthat almost none of the Census tracts where African Americans own 60% or more of \nthe homes have a median home value of $150,000 or more, whereas the vast majority \nof Census Tracts where Whites own 80% or more of the homes have a median home \n                                                                                                                                                             \narbitrary quality of thoughtlessness can be as disastrous and unfair to private rights and the public interest \nas the perversity of a willful scheme.’”) (citations omitted)).   \n  26 \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 50-1    Filed 06/02/10   Page 34 of 51\n \nvalue between $150,000 and $300,000, or $300,000 and $500,000.

R); accord PolicyLink Study at 46, 49 (Ex. S) (reporting “average \npre-storm home value by block” in “select heavily damaged neighborhoods” in New \nOrleans, to demonstrate how the “predominantly African American neighborhoods” \nof “Gentilly, Lower 9th ward, and New Orleans East had lower pre-storm value”). \n \n•  The affidavit of a veteran New Orleans real estate professional and public official \nwith authority over housing issues, who states that “Based on my experience, I have \nobserved that pre-Katrina homes in predominantly African American neighborhoods \nwere valued less than comparably size homes in predominantly White \nneighborhoods.”  Johnson Aff. ¶ 6 (Ex. T).  \n \nSecond, LRA adopted and HUD approved a grant formula that determines awards based \non the lesser of the pre-storm home value or the cost of repairing damage.  Road Home Policies \n3.4, at 12 (Ex. L).  \nThird, as African American homeowners in New Orleans are more likely than White \nhomeowners to own homes with lower pre-storm values, and because Road Home program grant \nawards are based on the lesser of pre-storm value of the home or the cost of repairing damage, \nAfrican American homeowners in New Orleans are more likely than White homeowners to \nreceive grants based on the pre-storm value of their homes rather than the higher cost of repair, \nand experience more frequent and larger gaps in rebuilding resources than White homeowners.   \nThe following evidence strongly supports these factual allegations: \n•  The PolicyLink study analyzed the LRA’s state-wide program data and found that the \nrebuilding gap “was larger for African American applicants [$39,082 on average] \nthan their white counterparts [$30,863]” and that “[t]he grant formula had a more \nnegative effect on those whose homes were valued less than their damage estimates.” \nPolicyLink Study at 42-43 (Ex. S).   \n \n•  Because of the large racial disparities in home values in New Orleans, the disparities \nobserved by PolicyLink are very likely to be even greater within New Orleans than \nstatewide, as evidenced by the disparities reported for selected neighborhoods in New \nOrleans.  See id. at 48 (finding that in the Lower 9th Ward, a predominantly African \nAmerican neighborhood, the average pre-storm home value was $100,739, the \n  27 \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 50-1    Filed 06/02/10   Page 35 of 51\n \naverage Road Home grant was $93,401, and the average gap in rebuilding resources \nwas $75,355, whereas in the predominantly White neighborhood of Lakeview, the \naverage pre-storm home value was $336,064, the average Road Home grant was \n$109,777, and the average gap in rebuilding resources was $44,405); see also id. \n(finding that 66.1% of the Lower 9th Ward applicants faced gaps of more than \n$40,000, while only 35.2% of Lakeview applicants faced such a substantial gap); id. \nat 42, 47 (stating that homeowners in New Orleans on average experienced a much \nlarger rebuilding gap, $54,586, than homeowners statewide, $35,865).    \n \n•  The affidavits of African American homeowners who received very low grant awards \nbased on the pre-storm value of their homes and, therefore, have faced large gaps in \nrebuilding resources and have been unable to rebuild their homes.  See Ford Aff. ¶¶ 5-\n6 (Ex. U) (stating that the damage to her home was $297,000 for which she received \nover $146,000 in insurance proceeds; but she received a Road Home grant of only \n$1,468 based on her pre-storm home value of $150,000, and as result has not finished \nrepairing her home, despite spending $35,000 of her own money and taking out a \n$54,000 SBA loan); Randolph Aff. ¶¶ 5-7 (Ex. V) (stating that the damage to his \nhome was over $308,000 for which he received about $107,000 in insurance \nproceeds, he received a Road Home grant of only $16,649, and as a result he is still \n“short $173,193 needed to rebuild [his] house” and “all repairs are not yet \ncompleted”).    \n \n•  An affidavit of Carol George Johnson, the owner of a mortgage company in New \nOrleans that provides mortgages to thousands of New Orleans homeowners, who \nstates that she has “observed that because of the formula employed [by LRA], Road \nHome Program grant awards have been issued in a manner such that homeowners in \npredominantly African American areas receive lower grant awards than homeowners \nin predominantly White areas.”  Johnson Aff. ¶ 7 (Ex. T).   \n \nThe LRA’s Executive Director conceded this point by telling Congress that he is “sure it \nis true” and he “does not deny that” it is “true that African-American homeowners are more \nlikely to receive what is called the pre-storm value for their homes by virtue of the [] \nmethodologies that [the LRA] use[s] to compute values . . . they are more likely to receive the \npre-storm value as opposed to the actual cost to repair value.”  Rainwater Testimony, Hearing \nTranscript at 23-24 (Ex. N).       \nTaken together, these key facts are more than sufficient to show that the LRA’s \n“outwardly neutral” grant formula has “actually or predictably” had a “significantly adverse or \n  28 \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 50-1    Filed 06/02/10   Page 36 of 51\n \ndisproportionate impact” on African American homeowners in New Orleans.  Huntington \nComm., 316 F.3d at 366.  Accordingly, the Court should find that the Plaintiffs will be able to \n“make out a prima facie case under the FHA on a theory of disparate impact.”  Id. \n   Once the Plaintiffs present a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the LRA to \ndemonstrate that (1) it had  a “bona fide governmental interest” in using the pre-storm value to \ndetermine the amount of Road Home grants, and (2) “no alternative would serve the \n[government’s] interest with less discriminatory effect.”  Id. (quoting Town of Huntington, 844 \nF.2d at 936).  The LRA, however, cannot satisfy either standard.   \nFirst, as the primary function of the Road Home Homeowner Assistance program is to \nassist homeowners in rebuilding their homes, see LRA Action Plan Amendment 14 (May 14, \n2007) at 1 (Ex. M), LRA cannot assert that it has a bona fide interest in using the pre-storm value \nto determine Road Home grants when that formula will leave, and has left, owners of homes in \nareas with depressed property values without the means to complete repairs.  As Rainwater has \nmade clear and as the record evidence shows, a homeowner who receives an Option 1 Road \nHome grant based on a pre-storm value will typically not have adequate funds to rebuild his or \nher home, whereas a homeowner who receives a grant based on the cost of repairing the damage \ntypically will be able to rebuild his or her home.  See Hearing Transcript at 11, 17-20, 90; see \nsupra at 11-14.  \n  Second, the LRA cannot show the absence of a less discriminatory alternative.    \nHuntington Comm., 316 F.3d at 366.  Indeed, an alternative that would have had no adverse \nimpact was readily available.  LRA’s Executive Director conceded an across-the-board grant \nformula based on the cost of repairing damage would have been an acceptable alternative and \nwould have reduced or eliminated the disparities faced by owners of homes in areas with low \n  29 \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 50-1    Filed 06/02/10   Page 37 of 51\n \npre-storm values, most of whom in New Orleans were African American.  See Hearing \nTranscript at 18-19, 23-24.  Nor is there any greater likelihood that HUD could satisfy this \nstandard.  Therefore, neither the LRA nor HUD can claim that a less discriminatory alternative \nwas unavailable. \nAs there is little chance the Defendants can carry their burden of rebutting the Plaintiffs’ \nprima facie case, the Plaintiffs have a strong likelihood of prevailing in their disparate impact \nclaim.  Accordingly, the Plaintiffs have satisfied the first part of the four-part balancing test for \ntemporary and preliminary relief.   \nB.  Absent an Order Freezing the Assets Available to Satisfy the Equitable Relief the \nPlaintiffs Seek in This Action Until the Merits of This Action Can be Adjudicated, \nthe Plaintiffs Will Be Irreparably Harmed  \n   \nFor an injury to constitute irreparable harm, it “must be ‘certain and great,’ ‘actual and \nnot theoretical,’ and ‘of such imminence that there is a clear and present need for equitable relief \nto prevent irreparable harm.’”  FOP Library of Cong. Labor Comm., 639 F. Supp. 2d at 24 \n(quoting CFGC, 454 F.3d at 297).  In addition, it “must be ‘beyond remediation,” which means \nthat “[t]he possibility that adequate compensatory or other corrective relief will be available at a \nlater date, in the ordinary course of litigation weighs heavily against a claim of irreparable \nharm.”  Id. (quoting CFGC, 454 F.3d at 297-98 (citation omitted)); see also 11A Wright, Miller \nand Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2948.1 (1995) (“Only when the threatened harm \nwould impair the court’s ability to grant an effective remedy is there really a need for \npreliminary relief.”)).16  \n                                                 \n16 In the context of the FHA, a number of courts have adopted a rebuttable presumption of \nirreparable harm when the court finds that the Plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on the \nmerits.  See Gresham v. Windrush Partners, Ltd., 730 F.2d 1417, 1423 (11th Cir. 1984) (holding that \n“because of the subtle, pervasive, and essentially irremediable nature of racial discrimination, proof of the \nexistence of discriminatory housing practices is sufficient to permit a court to presume irreparable \n  30 \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 50-1    Filed 06/02/10   Page 38 of 51\n \nThe LRA has already obligated and spent hundreds of millions of dollars of the \nremaining Road Home Homeowner Assistance funds, and in the near future it will take action to \nobligate and spend the $148 million of remaining funds it possesses.  See supra at 17-21.  \nSimilarly, the LRA or its successor could obtain from HUD within the near future an obligation \nand disbursement of all or part of the $500 million from Congress’ third emergency \nappropriation that remains unobligated.  See id. at 21.  As these funds taken together, which \namount to $648 million, barely exceed the estimated cost of $516 million needed to fund \nrecalculated grants for nearly 9,500 homeowners in Orleans Parish, any additional commitment \nof the remaining Road Home funds will likely preclude the full award of equitable relief the \nPlaintiffs seek in this action.   \nOnce the LRA and HUD obligate a portion or all of the remaining Road Home funds for \nother purposes, the funds “cannot be recouped” and, therefore, the Plaintiffs will suffer \nirreparable harm, as “[i]t will be impossible in the absence of a preliminary injunction to award \nthe plaintiffs the relief they request if they should eventually prevail on the merits.”  Ambach v. \nBell, 686 F.2d 974, 986 (D.C.

The Plaintiffs have a strong equitable interest \nin the remaining Road Home funds, as their entire ability to obtain relief is tied directly to those \nfunds, and the only type of relief they seek is the “equitable remedy of an injunction” requiring \nthe LRA prospectively to implement the Road Home program in a non-discriminatory manner.  \nId. at 1159-60.

See supra at 17-21. \nGiven that the Defendants currently possess about the same amount of funds as are \nneeded to provide full equitable relief, it is clear that without an injunction the Defendants will \nlack sufficient funds to satisfy a judgment for the Plaintiffs, creating an imminent and concrete \nrisk of irreparable harm.

Absent relief to enjoin \ncommitment and disbursement of the remaining Road Home funds, many Plaintiffs will be \nunable to complete repairs to their homes in sufficient time to satisfy “covenants” required by \nLRA in every grant, that the homeowner “use the property within 3 years from the date of \nclosing as a primary residence.”  Road Home Homeowner Policies Version 7.0 at 48 (Ex. ee).   \nLRA rules require that homeowners who fail to satisfy this covenant repay the entire grant, \nnotwithstanding that the grant funds have been expended on repairs made to date.  See id. \n(“Applicants who fail to meet the terms of the covenants are required to pay back the entire \ngrant amount.”) (emphasis added).  \nFailure to occupy homes, because repairs couldn’t be completed without grants calibrated \nto the cost of repair, would likely cause most homeowners to become insolvent and risk the loss \n  35 \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 50-1    Filed 06/02/10   Page 43 of 51\n \nof their property altogether.  See Johnson Aff. ¶ 5, 8 (Ex. T) (stating that “many of my clients \n[95% of whom are minority] . . . are at significant risk of losing their property because they are \nunable to adequately rebuild and return to their homes, and therefore they cannot comply with \nthe Road Home Program covenant requiring them to use as their primary residence within three \nyears from the date of their closing with the Road Home Program.”).18   The loss of property \nwould, by its very nature, constitute irreparable harm to the Plaintiffs.  \nIt is well settled that land is unique and its loss would cause irreparable harm.  Pelfresne \nv. Village of Williams Bay, 865 F.2d 877, 883 (7th Cir. 1989) (“As a general rule, interference \nwith the enjoyment or possession of land is considered ‘irreparable’ since land is viewed as a \nunique commodity for which monetary compensation is an inadequate substitute.”); United \nChurch of the Med. Ctr. v. Med. Ctr. Comm’n, 689 F.2d 693, 701 (7th Cir. 1982) (uniqueness of \nland “settled beyond the need for citation.”).  Thus, the LRA’s clawback provisions threaten \nmany Plaintiffs’ primary asset – their homes – and poses a very real threat of irreparable harm. \nFor all these reasons, the Plaintiffs have shown that, absent the temporary and, if \nnecessary, preliminary relief sought herein, they would almost assuredly, and certainly “likely,” \nsuffer irreparable harm. \n \n                                                 \n18 See also Affidavit of Seth Weingart, Homeownership Counseling Supervisor at the Greater \nNew Orleans Fair Housing Action Center ¶ 5 (May 29, 2010) (Ex. ff) (stating that, as a housing counselor \nin New Orleans since 2006, he has observed that “many homeowners who received Road Home Program \ngrant awards are at risk of losing their homes, because they are unable to satisfy the grant covenants to \nreoccupy their homes.  They are at risk of the State of Louisiana taking their homes for failing to abide by \nthe grant covenants, and at risk of foreclosure by their mortgage lenders for being unable to pay \nmortgages on homes they are unable to live in. These grantees would not have the financial capacity to \nrepay a loan if such a program was available, due to the fact that they are already overburdened with a \nmortgage and other debts, lack of income, and poor credit.

A Preliminary Injunction Will Not Substantially Harm the Defendants or Other \nInterested Parties \nThe third factor also weighs strongly in favor of granting preliminary injunctive relief.  \nNeither the Defendants nor any other interested third parties will suffer harm, let alone \n“substantial harm,” if this Court enjoins LRA from obligating or spending the remaining Road \nHome funds until it decides this case on its merits.  See Jasperson, 460 F. Supp. 2d at 88 (“The \ncourt must consider . . . whether the issuance of injunctive relief would ‘substantially harm’ other \nparties”).   \nUnlike the immediate, certain and grave harm the Plaintiffs face, the LRA plainly will not \nsuffer substantial harm.  The delay in obligating and disbursing the remaining Road Home funds \nis insufficient  to demonstrate substantial harm either to LRA or to HUD.  Indeed, delay alone \ndoes not constitute harm to defendants or third parties sufficient to deny a request for injunctive \nrelief.  See Monument Realty LLC v. Wash. Metro. Area Transit Auth., 540 F. Supp. 2d 66, 80-81 \n(D.D.C. 2008) (finding that the balance of harms favored the plaintiff where it faced loss of the \nright to purchase unique and irreplaceable real property, while defendant transit authority merely \nfaced delay in its ability to sell the property).19  In contrast to the temporary delay that the \nDefendants might experience if an injunction is granted, should the Court deny Plaintiffs’ motion \nfor a preliminary injunction, the Plaintiffs will likely lose their opportunity forever to have the \nLRA recalculate their grants on a non-discriminatory basis.  See City of Houston, 24 F.3d at \n                                                 \n19 See also PCTV Gold, Inc. v.

Gist, 976 F. Supp. 601, 616-17 (S.D. Tex. 1996) (preliminary injunctive relief blocking federal \ndistribution of funds was warranted where plaintiff county would otherwise suffer irreparable harm of \nlosing its right to negotiate with defendant city over proper distribution of the funds, while defendant city \nwould only face delay in receiving the grant money). \n   \n  37 \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 50-1    Filed 06/02/10   Page 45 of 51\n \n1426-27 (to avoid having its case mooted, a plaintiff must seek injunctive relief before agency \nfunds at issue are fully obligated or awarded); see supra at 31-32.  \nMoreover, no other interested parties20 will face substantial harm.  First, the vast majority \nof individuals eligible for the LRA’s lending program – whether or not they are potential class \nmembers – will actually benefit from preliminary relief, as  most individuals eligible for the \nLRA’s loan program would receive higher recalculated grants based on the cost of their repairs, \nrather than pre-storm value, should the plaintiffs prevail in this action.     \nThere is no dispute that LRA’s lending program is limited to “Road Home recipients who \nare not able to get back into their homes with their current resources,” LRA Proposed Action \nPlan Amendment No. 43 at 3 (Ex. aa), and that homeowners who face sizeable gaps in rebuilding \ncosts making it difficult for them to “get back into their homes” were far more likely to receive \ngrants based on the lower pre-storm value than the cost of repairing damage.  See PolicyLink \nStudy at 43.  Therefore, most of the homeowners eligible to receive a loan under the LRA’s new \nlending program received grants based on the lower pre-storm value.  And these homeowners \nwho received grants based on pre-storm values would receive a higher recalculated grant if this \nCourt orders the LRA to implement a non-discriminatory formula.   \nThe benefits of receiving a larger recalculated grant that need not be repaid undoubtedly \nexceed the value of receiving a loan, pursuant to LRA’s proposed Amendment 43, that must be \n                                                 \n20 As a large portion of the Road Home grant recipients who have been unable to rebuild due to \ninsufficient grants are actually members of the proposed plaintiff class, they cannot be considered “other \ninterested parties.”  Indeed, named Plaintiffs have affirmed that repairs to their homes remain incomplete \nbecause they still have not received sufficient funding from the Road Home Program, making them \npotentially eligible for the new lending program.  See, e.g., Ford Aff. ¶ 6 (Ex. U) (“I have been living on \nmy property since September 2008, but repairs are not completed, because I did not receive enough \nmoney from the Road Home Program or insurance to complete repairs.”); Randolph Aff. ¶ 6 (Ex. V) \n(“With the grant award I received from the Road Home, insurance and FEMA, I am still short $173,193 \nneeded to rebuild my house.”).   \n  38 \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 50-1    Filed 06/02/10   Page 46 of 51\n \nrepaid in the near future.  For example, a homeowner in the situation of Mr. Randolph, who \nreceived a grant of $16,649, would clearly prefer a recalculated grant of $150,000 instead of a \nloan of any amount.  And for homeowners who have limited or fixed incomes, it is unlikely they \nwould be able to repay a loan, making a grant the only feasible option.  Moreover, for a \nhomeowner who already has been forced to borrow funds because the Road Home grant award \nwas insufficient to defray all rebuilding costs, offering him yet another loan – rather than a grant \n– will only increase his overall debt.  See, e.g., Ford Aff. ¶ 6 (Ex. U).  \nSecond, in evaluating the impact of an injunction on existing Road Home recipients, the \nCourt must recognize that the LRA’s lending proposal will actually increase and further \nperpetuate discrimination against African American homeowners.  Simply put, the LRA’s \nlending proposal will deepen the disparities between the benefits received by White and African \nAmerican homeowners—Whites more often received grants based on the full cost of repairing \ntheir homes, while African Americans more often received grants based on the low pre-storm \nvalue of their homes plus a loan that must be repaid.  \nThe balance of harms, therefore, decidedly tips in favor of granting preliminary relief, as \nthe Plaintiffs risk the loss of any means to redress the harm giving rise to this action, whereas the \nDefendants, at most, face delay in implementing their programs.  As most of the homeowners \neligible to receive a loan under the program LRA presently contemplates would likely be eligible \nfor higher recalculated grants and thus ultimately benefit from a delay, the balance tips even \nfurther towards granting preliminary relief. \n \n \n \n  39 \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 50-1    Filed 06/02/10   Page 47 of 51\n \nD.  The Public Interest Unequivocally Favors Injunctive Relief \nThe public interest plainly favors enjoining the LRA from obligating or spending the \nremaining Road Home funds, and barring LRA from seeking the obligation and/or disbursement \nof the remaining funds HUD has, as denial of such relief will deprive the Plaintiffs of an ability \nto vindicate their civil and fair housing rights, and will guarantee that they will be denied an \nequal opportunity to benefit from the nation’s largest emergency housing program.   \nFirst, “[t]here can be no doubt that the public interest lies in terminating” such \ndiscrimination.  Cook v. Billington, No. 82-0400, 1988 WL 35364, at *2 (D.D.C. Mar. 31, 1988).   \nIndeed, the Supreme Court has recognized that the eradication of housing discrimination serves \n“an overriding societal priority.”  United States v. Edward Rose & Sons, 384 F.3d 258, 264 (6th \nCir. 2004) (quoting Meyer v. Holley, 537 U.S. 280, 290 (2003)).  Moreover, eliminating housing \ndiscrimination and affirmatively promoting fair housing were the very purposes of enacting the \nFair Housing Act.  See 42 U.S.C. § 3601 (“It is the policy of the United States to provide, within \nconstitutional limitations, for fair housing throughout the United States.”); see also Price v. \nPelka, 690 F.2d 98, 101 (6th Cir. 1982) (“The eradication of housing discrimination is a policy \nthat Congress considered to be of the highest priority.”) (citing Trafficante v. Metro. Life Ins. \nCo., 409 U.S. 205 (1972)).  And, “[i]n deciding what issues are imbued with the ‘public interest,’ \ncourts have given considerable weight to the policies of Congress[.]”  James Wm. Moore, et al., \nMoore’s Federal Practice at § 65.22[3], at 65-58 (2010). \nThe importance of remedying housing discrimination is well established.  Courts, \nincluding those within this Circuit, have routinely emphasized that remedying discrimination is \nan important public interest in cases involving violations of the Fair Housing Act.  See, e.g., \nBrown v. Artery Org., Inc., 691 F. Supp. 1459, 1461 (D.D.C. 1987) (concluding that “the public \n  40 \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 50-1    Filed 06/02/10   Page 48 of 51\n \ninterest would be better served by remedying any possible racial injustice” and denying \ndefendants’ motion to stay); Brown v. Artery Org., Inc., 654 F. Supp. 1106, 1119 (D.D.C. 1987) \n(concluding that “the public interest will most readily be served if prevention of the spread of \nracial discrimination in housing is given priority weight.”); Price, 690 F.2d at 101 (“Private \nenforcement of the Fair Housing Act and 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1982 not only vindicates the \ncivil rights of the individual victim of discrimination, but promotes the public interest by \neradicating housing discrimination.”); United States v. Edward Rose & Sons, 246 F. Supp .2d \n744, 755 (E.D. Mich. 2003) (“[W]here there has been a showing of housing discrimination, \npreliminary injunctive relief serves the public interest by carrying out the stated policy of the \nUnited States in 42 U.S.C. § 3601”); United States v. Puerto Rico, 764 F. Supp. 220, 225 (D.P.R. \n1991) (granting injunction and emphasizing “the public interest that all citizens have in seeing \nvigorous enforcement of civil rights legislation like the Fair Housing Act.”).21 \nSecond, “[t]he public has an interest in assuring that public funds are appropriated and \ndistributed pursuant to Congressional directives.”  Population Inst., 797 F.2d at 1082.  As \nCongress specifically directed that the Road Home funds be spent pursuant to federal fair \nhousing and anti-discrimination standards, 2005 Act, 119 Stat. at 2780; 2006 Act, 120 Stat. at \n472-73, “the public interest will be frustrated” if the LRA is permitted to “distribute the funds” in \ndirect contravention of the civil rights standards “dictated by Congress.”  Population Inst., 797 \nF.2d at 1082; see also Letter from Rep. Maxine Waters to HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan (Apr. \n                                                 \n21 Likewise, outside the fair housing context, courts have found that the public interest favors \ngranting injunctive relief in the face of a discriminatory formula promulgated by a state agency.  See \nSouth Camden Citizens in Action v. N.J. Dep’t of Env. Prot., 145 F. Supp. 2d 446, 502 (D.N.J. 2001) \n(concluding the public interest favored plaintiff, in part because “requiring the [state agency] to comply \nwith the EPA’s Title VI implementing regulations is inherently in the public interest, insofar as it ensures \nthe protection of civil rights”).   \n \n  41 \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 50-1    Filed 06/02/10   Page 49 of 51\n \n14, 2010) at 1-2 (Ex. gg) (stating that the Road Home program “appears to contravene the fair \nhousing protections enshrined in federal law—protections that were explicitly mandated by \nCongress when it funded the Road Home program.”). \nFinally, if the Court preserves the status quo and the Plaintiffs are able to obtain the \ntemporary and preliminary relief they seek, nearly 9,500 homeowners in Orleans Parish will \nreceive additional resources that will help them finish repairing their homes.  See id. at 2 (stating \nthat the Road Home Program’s “discrimination . . . poses a major obstacle to rebuilding the great \ncity of New Orleans and enabling its people to return home,” and that many African American \nfamilies “impacted by this discriminatory policy . . . still face insurmountable barriers to \nrebuilding.”).  Undoubtedly, completing these rebuilding efforts, especially in predominantly \nAfrican American neighborhoods, will improve the lives of residents, homeowners, and \ncommunities in New Orleans in so many tangible and intangible ways.22  As this Court has \nexpressly recognized that rehabilitating communities is in the public interest, Brown, 654 F. \nSupp. at 1119 (noting that the argument that rehabilitating apartment complexes is in the public \ninterest has “obvious merit”), surely the same logic applies to rebuilding thousands of homes \nthere were devastated by Hurricane Katrina.     \nIn short, there is overwhelming legal authority and evidence that a preliminary injunction \nwill further the public interest by remedying costly discrimination, ensuring that the nation’s \nlargest federal housing program is administered according to the express fair housing mandates \nof Congress, and assisting thousands of homeowners to complete their repairs. \n                                                 \n22   Relatedly, granting injunctive relief will provide an economic benefit to the New Orleans and \nLouisiana governments, as such relief will make it possible for thousands of displaced residents to receive \nadditional assistance and properly repair their homes, which will translate into higher property values.  \nHigher property values, of course, will translate to higher property tax collections for the city and state \ngovernments.  Moreover, all homeowners in the City of New Orleans will benefit from the rising property \nvalues.   \n  42 \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 50-1    Filed 06/02/10   Page 50 of 51\n \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, pending this Court’s consideration of Plaintiffs’ claims on the \nmerits, the Court should temporarily restrain and, if necessary, preliminarily enjoin the LRA \nfrom taking any action to obligate any funds that remain available in the Road Home \nHomeowner Assistance program, and also enjoin the LRA from taking any action to request that  \nHUD further obligate, award or disburse Road Home funds in its custody.   \n \nDated: June 2, 2010.

In the briefing currently before the Court, plaintiffs\nfocus only on their FHA claim, so this memorandum opinion similarly does not discuss this\nsecond claim.\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 61    Filed 07/06/10   Page 2 of 17\ngrants as part of the Road Home Homeowner Assistance Program (“Road Home Program” or\n“Program”), a housing redevelopment initiative designed to help homeowners affected by\nHurricanes Katrina and Rita.  Plaintiffs seek an injunction requiring recalculation of Program\nawards to homeowners in New Orleans using a formula that does not have a disparate impact on\nAfrican Americans.  \nOn June 29, 2010, the Court issued an order that denied plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary\nrestraining order and a preliminary injunction [#50] which sought to enjoin Keegan from\nspending surplus funds that remain available to the Road Home Program, or seeking any\nadditional Program funds from HUD, while this case is pending.  This opinion explains the\nreasoning on which that order was based.\nI. BACKGROUND\nIn 2005, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita caused catastrophic damage to New Orleans,\nLouisiana, and other nearby places.  In response, Congress created a block grant program to assist\nin recovery of the region, which it funded through three appropriations statutes.  See Pub. L. No.\n109-148, 119 Stat. 2680, 2779-81 (Dec. 30, 2005); Pub. L. No. 109-234, 120 Stat. 418, 472-73\n(June 15, 2006); Pub. L. No. 110-116, 121 Stat. 1295, 1343-44 (Nov. 13, 2007).  Pursuant to\nthese statutes and HUD regulations, the State of Louisiana was to receive $13.4 billion.  See 71\nFed. Reg. 7666, 7666 (Feb. 13, 2006) (allocating $6.2 billion from the first appropriation to\nLouisiana); 71 Fed. Reg. 63,337, 63,338 (Oct. 30, 2006) (allocating $4.2 billion from the second\nappropriation to Louisiana); 121 Stat. at 1343-44 (appropriating $3 billion for supplemental\ngrants to Louisiana).\n2\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 61    Filed 07/06/10   Page 3 of 17\nLouisiana designated approximately $11 billion of those funds for the Road Home\nProgram.  The LRA, in consultation with HUD, developed the Program; HUD approved it and\ndisburses the money Congress has appropriated for it to the LRA; and the LRA administers it. \nUnder a portion of the Program called Option 1, an individual whose house was damaged by the\nhurricanes may choose to receive a grant to repair or rebuild her home.3  Each beneficiary of an\nOption 1 grant receives an award in the amount of either the value of her home before the storms\nor the cost of repairing her home, whichever is less, but not in excess of $150,000.  Since\nplaintiffs initiated their suit, the LRA has created Additional Compensation Grants (“ACGs”),\nsupplemental awards available to Option 1 beneficiaries whose incomes are at or below eighty\npercent of the median in their areas.  Regardless of the pre-storm values of their homes, these\nindividuals may receive ACGs such that their total awards from the Road Home Program reach\nthe cost of repairs to their homes, still subject to the $150,000 cap.\nSince the Road Home Program’s inception, the LRA has distributed Option 1 awards to\ntens of thousands of homeowners.  As of the time of the briefing regarding plaintiffs’ current\nmotion, only 179 individuals who applied for Option 1 grants had yet to receive their awards. \nThe LRA has money set aside to fund grants for those individuals, to continue to distribute ACGs\nto eligible individuals, and for other projects within the Road Home Program.  The LRA is\ncurrently seeking approval to use much of the Program money not yet designated to a specific use\nfor “Action Plan Amendment 43,” a construction lending program designed to assist Road Home\n3 The Program also permits homeowners to instead opt to receive smaller grants to\nobtain housing elsewhere in Louisiana or outside the state.  The design and implementation of\nthose aspects of the Program are not at issue here.\n3\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 61    Filed 07/06/10   Page 4 of 17\nProgram beneficiaries who have not been able to complete repairs to their homes.  Keegan\nestimates that she has $554.5 million remaining in the Program budget.\nIndividual plaintiffs Gloria Burns, Rhonda Dents, Almarie Ford, Daphne Jones, and\nEdward Randolph are African Americans who own homes in New Orleans that were severely\ndamaged by Hurricane Katrina, and subsequent flooding, in 2005.4  Each applied for a Road\nHome Program grant under Option 1, and each received an award based on the pre-storm value\nof her or his home rather than the cost of repairing that home.5  Since receiving their initial\ngrants, Burns and Jones have been deemed eligible to receive ACGs such that their total awards\nwill amount to $150,000. \nIn their complaint, plaintiffs allege that the LRA’s reliance on home values in calculating\nawards “has a discriminatory disparate impact on African Americans living in historically\nsegregated communities.”  Compl. ¶ 52.  Specifically, they argue that because “African American\nhomeowners in New Orleans are more likely than white homeowners in New Orleans to own\n4 The other plaintiffs, Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center, a non-\nprofit organization based in Louisiana, and the National Fair Housing Alliance, a non-profit\norganization based in Washington, D.C., are advocacy groups that, inter alia, oppose housing\ndiscrimination.  \n5 According to the complaint, Burns received $106,500, which was $89,000 less\nthan the cost of damage to her home and $43,500 less than the maximum she could have\nreceived; Dents received $88,534, which was $58,730 less than the cost of damage to her home;\nFord received $3,468, which was $156,073 less than the cost of damage to her home and\n$146,532 less than the maximum she could have received; Jones received $61,000, which was\n$45,262 less than the cost of damage to her home; and Randolph received $16,650, which was\n$173,193 less than the cost of damage to his home and $133,350 less than the maximum he could\nhave received.  Compl. ¶¶ 61-65.  Some of the awards are in amounts less than the pre-storm\nvalue of the home because the LRA deducts from each grant any amount of money the\nhomeowner has received as compensation for storm damage from her insurance company or\nanother source, such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n4\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 61    Filed 07/06/10   Page 5 of 17\nhomes with lower values,” African-American recipients of Road Home Program grants are more\nlikely than white recipients to receive only the amount of the pre-storm value of their homes and,\nconsequently, to have a larger gap than white recipients between the amount of the grant and the\ncost of rebuilding.  Compl. ¶¶ 54-57.  This effect, plaintiffs assert, constitutes a violation of the\nFair Housing Act.6  Ultimately, plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, “including but not limited to\nordering Defendants to cease immediately their violation of Plaintiffs’ rights, and to remedy the\ninvidious effects of their violations by recalculating Road Home homeowner grants in a\nnondiscriminatory manner.”  Compl. at 17.\nAt this time, plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction enjoining Keegan from spending any\nsurplus funds—that is, Program funds not already designated for the remaining 179 Option 1\nawards, ACGs, or any other specific use—until the merits of their case are resolved.  They make\nthis request because Keegan will only be able to distribute recalculated awards, should plaintiffs\nprevail on the merits, if sufficient Road Home Program funds remain available for that purpose.  \nPlaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction is accompanied by evidence they allege\nsupports their allegation that the Option 1 formula has a discriminatory effect.  Specifically, they\npoint to statistics from the U.S. Census showing that in New Orleans, homes owned by African\nAmericans have lower values, on average, than homes owned by whites.  Pls.’ Mot. for TRO, Ex.\nP.  They attached to their motion a study by PolicyLink, “a national independent research\n6 Specifically, Count I of the complaint alleges that defendants have (1) “made\nunavailable or denied housing to African American homeowners because of their race in\nviolation of” section 3604(a) of the FHA; (2) “discriminated against African Americans because\nof their race in the availability of, and in the terms and conditions of, real estate-related\ntransactions in violation of” section 3605(a) of the FHA; and (3) “failed to administer housing-\nrelated programs and activities in a manner that affirmatively furthers fair housing, in violation\nof” sections 3608(d) and 3608(e)(5) of the FHA.

Id. at 11-12; id., Ex. S.  They also assert that Paul Rainwater, Keegan’s predecessor\nat the LRA, told a subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives that home values in\nAfrican-American neighborhoods tend to be lower than in white neighborhoods and that he was\n“sure” that African-American homeowners were more likely than whites to receive awards based\non the value of their homes than the cost of repairs.  Id. at 15-16; id., Ex. N at 23-24.  Finally,\nthey attach to their motion the declaration of Carol Johnson, president of a Louisiana mortgage\ncompany, who asserts she has expertise in the mortgage industry and that she has “observed that\nbecause of the formula employed, Road Home Program grant calculations result in homeowners\nin predominantly African American areas received lower grant awards than homeowners in\npredominantly White areas.”  Id., Ex. T ¶ 7.7\nII. ANALYSIS\nThis court may issue a preliminary injunction only when the movant demonstrates: (1) “a\nsubstantial likelihood of success on the merits”; (2) “that it would suffer irreparable injury if the\ninjunction is not granted”; (3) “that an injunction would not substantially injure other interested\nparties”; and (4) “that the public interest would be furthered by the injunction.”  Mova Pharm.\nCorp. v. Shalala, 140 F.3d 1060, 1066 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (quoting CityFed Fin. Corp. v. Office of\n7 Keegan has moved to strike this declaration because Johnson is “not an expert\neconomist or statistician.”  Keegan Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. for TRO (“Keegan Opp’n”) at 29 n.20. \nPlaintiffs oppose this motion, arguing that Johnson has relevant expertise regarding home values\nin New Orleans.  The parties have made these arguments in less detail than is necessary for the\nCourt to rule on the motion.  Furthermore, the Court’s ruling on plaintiffs’ motion does not\ndepend on whether it considers this evidence.\n6\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 61    Filed 07/06/10   Page 7 of 17\nThrift Supervision, 58 F.3d 738, 746 (D.C. Cir. 1995)). “These factors interrelate on a sliding\nscale and must be balanced against each other.”  Serono Labs., Inc. v. Shalala, 158 F.3d 1313,\n1318 (D.C. Cir. 1998).  Because preliminary injunctions are “extraordinary and drastic” forms of\njudicial relief, district courts should not grant them “unless the movant, by a clear showing,\ncarries the burden of persuasion.”  Mazurek v. Armstrong, 520 U.S. 968, 972 (1997) (quoting\n11A C. WRIGHT, A. MILLER, & M. KANE, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 2948, pp.\n129-130 (2d ed.1995)) (emphasis in Mazurek). \nA. Plaintiffs Have Not Shown a Likelihood of Success on the Merits.\n1. Plaintiffs have demonstrated that they could likely make out a prima facie\ncase of discrimination in violation of the Fair Housing Act.\nFor the reasons explained below, the Court concludes that it may not provide the ultimate\nrelief plaintiffs seek and therefore should not grant the preliminary relief they currently request. \nBut the Court notes first that plaintiffs’ disparate impact claim under the Fair Housing Act\nappears to have merit.  Although full analysis of the issues raised here is unnecessary, the Court\nfeels compelled nevertheless to briefly explain its reasoning.  \nAlthough the D.C. Circuit did not determine in 2922 Sherman Avenue Tenants’\nAssociation v. District of Columbia, 444 F.3d 673 (D.C. Cir. 2006), which of two possible\nstandards courts in this Circuit are to apply in assessing disparate impact claims under the FHA, \nsee id. at 680, the Court believes that the appropriate approach is the burden-shifting framework\nadopted by several other Circuits.  Under this framework, “once the plaintiff demonstrates that\nthe challenged practice has a disproportionate impact, the burden shifts to the defendant to ‘prove\nthat its actions furthered, in theory and in practice, a legitimate, bona fide governmental interest\n7\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 61    Filed 07/06/10   Page 8 of 17\nand that no alternative would serve that interest with less discriminatory effect.’”  Id. (quoting\nHuntington Branch, NAACP v. Town of Huntington, 844 F.2d 926, 935-36 (2d Cir. 1988)).  \nPlaintiffs have demonstrated that they would likely be able to make out this prima facie\ncase after discovery.  The statistical and anecdotal evidence they submit to the Court leads to a\nstrong inference that, on average, African-American homeowners received awards that fell\nfarther short of the cost of repairing their homes than did white recipients.  Keegan’s attacks on\nthat evidence are unpersuasive.  Plaintiffs need not make a showing at this stage of the\nproceedings, before discovery and when briefing is necessarily rushed, sufficient to prove the\nmerits of their case.  Keegan neither demonstrates that plaintiffs’ statistics or logic is flawed nor\nprovides data about the administration of the Program that would show what effect the Option 1\nformula has had.  Cf. Berger v. Iron Workers Reinforced Rodmen Local 201, 843 F.2d 1395,\n1412 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (“Defendants may also attempt to undermine plaintiffs’ prima facie case\nby attacking the validity of plaintiffs’ statistical evidence, or by introducing statistical evidence\nof their own showing that the challenged practice did not have racially disproportionate results.” \n(citation omitted)).  She has also offered no legitimate reason for taking pre-storm home values\ninto account in calculating Program awards.  The Court does not take lightly that some African-\nAmerican homeowners received lower awards than they would have if their homes were in\npredominantly white neighborhoods.  And, although the Court appreciates that all of the parties\nare committed to the rebuilding of a city that has suffered greatly, it is regrettable that this effort\nto do so appears to have proceeded in a manner that disadvantaged African-American\nhomeowners who wish to repair their homes.\n8\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 61    Filed 07/06/10   Page 9 of 17\n2. Plaintiffs cannot prevail on the merits because this Court does not have the\nauthority to grant the ultimate relief they seek.\nKeegan argues that regardless of the merit of plaintiffs’ discrimination claim, the Court\nlacks subject matter jurisdiction over this case because the Eleventh Amendment to the U.S.\nConstitution bars the Court from providing the relief plaintiffs seek.  Her primary argument8 is\nbased on a legal premise the Court explained in some detail in a Clarification [#52] to an order it\nentered regarding a motion to dismiss Keegan filed before plaintiffs submitted their motion.  For\nclarity, the Court again describes the legal background before addressing plaintiffs’ response.\nThe Eleventh Amendment bars suits against states absent the relevant state’s consent to\nbe sued.  See Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 276 (1986).9  But in Ex parte Young, 209 U.S.\n123 (1908), the Supreme Court held that “[a] federal court is not barred by the Eleventh\nAmendment from enjoining state officers from acting unconstitutionally, either because their\naction is alleged to violate the Constitution directly or because it is contrary to a federal statute or\nregulation that is the supreme law of the land.”  Vann v. Kempthorne, 534 F.3d 741, 749 (D.C.\nCir. 2008) (quoting CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT ET AL., FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 4232\n8 Keegan also argues that Eleventh Amendment immunity bars this action because\nthe LRA, and therefore the State of Louisiana, “not Keegan, is the real party in interest in this\nsuit.”  Keegan Opp’n at 13.  But the Ex parte Young exception to sovereign immunity permits\nsuits against state officers by relying on “the fiction that the suit [goes] against the officer and not\nthe State,” Vann v. Kempthorne, 534 F.3d 741, 749 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (citing Pennhurst State Sch.\n& Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 114 n.25 (1984)), and the Court disagrees with Keegan’s\ncontention that this fiction does not operate here.\n9 The Eleventh Amendment provides that “[t]he Judicial power of the United States\nshall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against\none of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign\nState.”  U.S. CONST. amend. XI.  The Supreme Court “long ago held that the Amendment bars\nsuits against a State by citizens of that same State as well.”  Papasan, 478 U.S. at 276 (citing\nHans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1 (1890)).\n9\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 61    Filed 07/06/10   Page 10 of 17\n(3d ed. 2007)).  The Supreme Court has directed that “[i]n determining whether the doctrine of\nEx parte Young avoids an Eleventh Amendment bar to suit, a court need only conduct a\n‘straightforward inquiry into whether [the] complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law\nand seeks relief properly characterized as prospective.’”  Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public Serv.\nComm’n, 535 U.S. 635, 645 (2002) (quoting Idaho v. Coeur d’Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U.S.\n261, 296 (1997) (O’Connor, J., concurring)).  In this context, the distinction between retroactive\nand prospective relief is significant because the Eleventh Amendment bars “a suit by private\nparties seeking to impose a liability which must be paid from public funds in the state treasury.” \nEdelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 663 (1974) (citations omitted); see also Verizon Md. Inc., 535\nU.S. at 645 (making clear that relief that “impose[s] upon the State ‘a monetary loss resulting\nfrom a past breach of a legal duty on the part of the defendant state officials’” is not permissible\n(quoting Edelman, 415 U.S. at 668) (emphasis removed)).  In other words, this Court cannot\norder the payment of damages to correct a prior unlawful act by a state official.  See Edelman,\n415 U.S. at 663 (holding that a federal court may not issue an order that requires a state to spend\nmoney that “should have been paid, but was not”).  \nBased on these principles of law, the Court suggested in its Clarification, and now holds,\nthat it may not grant plaintiffs’ request for an order mandating that LRA make payments to Road\nHome Program beneficiaries who have already received funds in amounts calculated using an\nallegedly discriminatory formula.  An order requiring Keegan to correct Road Home Program\npayments that have already been made would not provide prospective relief; it would require\npayment of state funds rather than prohibit certain actions in the future.  Plaintiffs do not dispute\nthe Court’s reliance on these fundamental principles, but they contest the Court’s understanding\n10\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 61    Filed 07/06/10   Page 11 of 17\nof the facts underlying this case and, therefore, its application of those principles to the situation\nat hand.  The Court cannot agree with their arguments.\na. The relief plaintiffs seek would require the expenditure of state, not\nfederal, funds.\n  First, plaintiffs argue that the Court may enter the injunction they seek because such an\norder would require the expenditure of federal funds, not state funds.  To demonstrate that this\ndistinction is legally significant, plaintiffs rely primarily on Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651\n(1974), quoting the many instances in that opinion in which the Supreme Court discussed the\nsignificance for an Eleventh Amendment analysis of requiring the payment of “state funds,” and\nthey repeat language from other cases relying on Edelman for the proposition that it is\nimpermissible for a federal court to impose a liability to be paid from the “state treasury.”  Pls.’\nResp. to Clarification at 8-9.10  They assert that because the LRA spends money that comes\ndirectly from HUD at Congress’s direction, the funds they wish the Court to order Keegan to use\nto correct award amounts do not belong to the state.\nThe Court does not find that the funds the LRA spends are federal.  It simply cannot be\nsaid that an injunction preventing a state official from disbursing money according to a program\nadministered by her state agency controls only the flow of federal funds.  Furthermore, a careful\nreading of Edelman reveals that the Supreme Court has made no distinction between money that\ncomes to a state account from the federal government as opposed to from some other source.  In\n10 Plaintiffs note in their reply to Keegan’s opposition to their motion that Keegan\nhas failed to address this point and argue Keegan has therefore conceded it.  The parties have\neach made a multitude of arguments in addressing the various complicated issues raised in this\ncase, and neither has directly addressed each point made by the other.  The Court will not assume\nthat any arguments are conceded.\n11\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 61    Filed 07/06/10   Page 12 of 17\nEdelman, the plaintiffs had successfully demonstrated that Illinois’s administration of a welfare\nprogram, which was “funded by the State and the Federal Governments” and administered by\nstate agencies, the directors of which were the named defendants, violated certain federal\nregulations.  Edelman, 415 U.S. at 653-56.  The opinion held that the district court had properly\nenjoined the state officers from continuing to administer the program in a manner that violated\nthose regulations but had improperly ordered that individuals who received less than they were\nowed because of past violations be compensated.  Id. at 664-65.  The Supreme Court referred\nthroughout to state funds and the state treasury, generating the quotes to which plaintiffs have\npointed, but nowhere did it distinguish funds that the federal government gave to the state for the\nwelfare program from those the state contributed from its own resources.  In other words, the\nopinion did not address the issue plaintiffs have raised and does not support plaintiffs’\narguments; the best inference to draw is that the Supreme Court considered federal money given\nto the state for administration of the relevant program to be state funds.11  For purposes of this\nanalysis, the money the LRA uses to make awards to Road Home Program beneficiaries are\nproperly considered state funds.\n11 None of the other cases plaintiffs cite contribute to an analysis of this issue.  See\nVerizon Md. Inc., 535 U.S. at 646 (distinguishing between an injunction that would require\npayment from a state treasury and one that imposed a financial liability on private parties); Quern\nv. Jordan, 440 U.S. 332, 337 (1979) (repeating language from Edelman but addressing only the\nquestion of whether ordering that a particular notice be sent to individuals who might have\nclaims against Illinois constitutes retroactive relief); Fla. Dep’t of State v. Treasure Salvors, Inc.,\n458 U.S. 670, 689-90 (1982) (reciting language from Edelman but addressing the propriety of a\nsuit against Florida based on the discovery of a sunken ship); Travelers Indem. Co. v. Sch. Bd. of\nDade County, Fla., 666 F.2d 505, 509 (11th Cir. 1982) (reciting language from Edelman but\naddressing whether the Florida board of education has Eleventh Amendment immunity under\ncertain circumstances not analogous to those here).\n12\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 61    Filed 07/06/10   Page 13 of 17\nb. An injunction requiring the correction of Option 1 awards would\nimpermissibly provide retroactive relief.\nSecond, plaintiffs argue that the relief they seek is prospective because the Road Home\nProgram is “continuing and open,” Pls.’ Resp. to Clarification at 11, and they therefore request\n“an end to [] present violation[s] of federal law,” id. (quoting Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265,\n278 (1986)) (alterations and emphasis in brief).  They argue that in contrast to Edelman, in which\nthe defendant state officers had failed to pay benefits that correlated to discrete past time periods,\nthe Road Home Program “has an ever-changing current balance sheet for an incomplete\nprogram.”  Id.  Keegan asserts that correction of Road Home Program awards previously\ndisbursed would constitute retroactive relief. \nThe fundamental premise here, explained above, is not in dispute: \nRelief that in essence serves to compensate a party injured in the past by an action\nof a state official in his official capacity that was illegal under federal law is\nbarred even when the state official is the named defendant. . . . On the other hand,\nrelief that serves directly to bring an end to a present violation of federal law is\nnot barred by the Eleventh Amendment even though accompanied by a substantial\nancillary effect on the state treasury. \n \nPapasan, 478 U.S. at 278 (citations omitted).  The Supreme Court has acknowledged that “the\nline between permitted and prohibited suits will often be indistinct,” id., but here, the outcome is\nunavoidable.  \nPlaintiffs’ characterization of the Road Home Program as ongoing does not persuade the\nCourt that an injunction requiring the recalculation of Option 1 awards would constitute\nprospective relief.  It is true that the Road Home Program as a whole is not complete.  But all but\n13\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 61    Filed 07/06/10   Page 14 of 17\n179 Option 1 grants have been distributed.12  It is also true that some Road Home Program\nrecipients have received funds in addition to their initial awards under Option 1.  But those\nsupplemental grants were not based on any change to the formula for, nor did they constitute a\nrecalculation of, Option 1 awards.  The allegedly discriminatory award amounts have, as to\nalmost all applicants, already been calculated and disbursed.  Correcting them, even by entry of\nan injunction, would effectively constitute an award of damages.  Cf. Papasan, 478 U.S. at 279\n(advising that “[i]n discerning on which side of the line [between prospective and retroactive\nrelief] a particular case falls,” a court is to “look to the substance rather than to the form of the\nrelief sought”).  As was the case in Edelman, the program at issue here distributes discrete\nawards; it does not provide any ongoing service such that a “present violation” of law can be said\nto exist.  Id. at 278; cf. Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 289 (1977) (holding that a court-\nordered program to remedy inequalities resulting from school segregation “fits squarely within\nthe prospective-compliance exception reaffirmed by Edelman” because it “enjoin[s] state\nofficials to conform their conduct to requirements of federal law” in the future operation of\nschools).\nWere the Court to order, as plaintiffs request, that Keegan recalculate awards that have\nalready been distributed and make supplemental payments to homeowners whose awards would\nhave been greater had they not been based on home values, it would impermissibly be requiring\nthe state to disburse money that “should have been paid, but was not.”  Edelman, 415 U.S. at\n12 The Court asked plaintiffs during oral argument on this motion whether they\nwould wish to go forward with their request for a preliminary injunction if the Court were to hold\nthat the ultimate relief they seek is only available to those 179 individuals.  Plaintiffs did not\nexpress a desire to limit their case to such a narrow group of Road Home Program beneficiaries.\n14\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 61    Filed 07/06/10   Page 15 of 17\n664.  It would impermissibly be doing more than  “enjoining state officers from acting\nunconstitutionally.”  Vann, 534 F.3d at 749.  Although, as explained, the Court suspects that the\nOption 1 formula did violate the Fair Housing Act, this Court has no authority to remedy it in the\nway plaintiffs ask.  Accordingly, the Court cannot find that plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the\nmerits of their case.\n2. Plaintiffs have not shown that they will face irreparable injury absent the\nentry of an injunction.\nPlaintiffs argue that without an injunction, the LRA will be able to spend any or all Road\nHome Program funds and an insufficient amount of money would remain available to provide the\nultimate relief they seek.  This reasoning relies on, among other assumptions, the premise that the\nLRA must hold approximately $516 million in order to comply with a future order from this\nCourt mandating the correction of the disparate impact of the Option 1 formula.  Keegan\nresponds that the LRA has sufficient funds to comply with an order from this Court enjoining her\nfrom using the existing Option 1 formula in calculating the awards owed to the 179 remaining\nOption 1 applicants.\nAs explained above, the Court may not order the relief plaintiffs seek.  There is no risk,\ntherefore, that any spending by the LRA will cause the irreparable harm plaintiffs foresee.13\n3. The injury to third parties that would result from the preliminary injunction\nplaintiffs seek weighs strongly against granting plaintiffs’ motion.\nPlaintiffs argue that other parties would not be harmed by the entry of the preliminary\ninjunction they seek.  They note that non-class members whose Road Home Program benefits\n13 As noted, plaintiffs’ counsel have declined to indicate that they wish to represent\nthe 179 applicants who have not yet received awards.\n15\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 61    Filed 07/06/10   Page 16 of 17\nmight be delayed by such an injunction would benefit overall if the LRA is ultimately made to\ncalculate future awards considering only the cost of repairs.  \nThe Court will not find that third parties would not be harmed by the entry of an\ninjunction of the sort plaintiffs seek.  Even though the preliminary injunction plaintiffs seek\nwould permit Keegan to disburse some Road Home Program funds, it would restrict her\nspending significantly.  Each dollar the Court enjoined her from spending would be a dollar\nwithheld from a Louisiana resident who wants to repair or rebuild her home and who has been\nunable to do so in the five years since the storm damaged it.  The Court notes that plaintiffs could\nhave initiated this case and sought preliminary relief long ago, before the Road Home Program\nwas almost complete and the funds almost depleted.  And the Court will not ignore the fact that\nthe delay a preliminary injunction would cause is significant; discovery and a resolution on the\nmerits of this case could, and likely would, take years.\n4. The public interest in an injunction does not weigh in favor of either party.\nPlaintiffs argue that it is in the public interest to remedy housing discrimination.  Keegan\nargues that the public interest would not be served by delaying the distribution of funds under the\nRoad Home Program and that Louisiana citizens “continue to need and rely upon funding from\nthe Road Home” Program.  Keegan Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. for TRO at 35. \nBecause both parties’ positions have merit, the Court finds that this factor does not weigh\nin favor of either party.  Plaintiffs are correct that there is a strong public interest in preventing\ndiscrimination on the basis of race, and the Court takes seriously Congress’s intent to do so by\nenacting the Fair Housing Act.  But Keegan is correct that there is a strong public interest in\ngoing forward with a program designed to repair a devastated area.  As noted above, a\n16\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 61    Filed 07/06/10   Page 17 of 17\npreliminary injunction would cause significant delay in the distribution of Program funds to\npeople who have suffered long enough.\n5. Conclusion\nThe Court must balance these four factors against each other.  Serono Labs., Inc. v.\nShalala, 158 F.3d 1313, 1318 (D.C. Cir. 1998).  In sum, the Court has found that plaintiffs’ Fair\nHousing Act claim likely has merit but that plaintiffs do not have a strong likelihood of success\nin this action because the Court cannot grant the relief they seek.  Furthermore, delaying the\nadministration of the Road Home Program would be harmful to Louisiana homeowners who still\nneed assistance.  Although the Court is not unsympathetic to the ways in which the law operates\nin this instance to preclude the possibility of correcting what may well be a discriminatory\nformula, it is bound to apply the law as it stands and it must consider the effect its ruling here\ncould have on individuals who are not represented.  For these reasons, the Court will not grant\nthe preliminary injunction plaintiff seek.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, on June 29, 2010, the Court entered an order denying\nplaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction [#50].\nHenry H. Kennedy, Jr.\nUnited States District Judge\n17",

Moore, and Craig \nGoldblatt. \nBefore: ROGERS and KAVANAUGH, Circuit Judges, and \nWILLIAMS, Senior Circuit Judge. \nOpinion  for the Court filed by  Senior  Circuit Judge  \nWILLIAMS.  \nOpinion  concurring in part and concurring in the \njudgment filed by Circuit Judge ROGERS. \nWILLIAMS, Senior Circuit Judge:  The pla intiffs in this \ncase are two fair housing organi zations in New Orleans and \nfive  African-American  homeowners.   They claim   that a \nprogram to help homeowners rebuild after hurricanes Katrina \nand Rita has employed a grant formula that violates the anti-\ndiscrimination provisions of the Fair Housing Act, particularly \n42 U.S.C. § 3604(a).  The progr am is administered by the \nOffice of Community Development (“OCD”) of the State of \nLouisiana,  an entity   we tre at  interchangeably  with  its \npredecessor,  the Louis iana  Recovery  Authority (“LRA”).   \nDefendant  Robin Keegan is the E xecutive  Director  of th e \nOCD.   Th e  U.S. Departm ent  of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment (“HUD”) is a defendant in the suit but has taken \nno part in this appeal and cross-appeal.   \nPlaintiffs sought preliminary injunctive relief, which the \ndistrict court initially denied on the ground that it was barred \nby state sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment.  \nPlaintiffs appealed.  While the appeal was pending, the district \ncourt  granted the plaintiffs ’  later  request  for narrowe r \ninjunctive relief.  Defendant Keegan cross-appealed.  Because \nit is plain that there are some potential remedies not running \nafoul of sovereign immunity, we  have jurisdiction to address \nthe  substantive  merits  of  plaintiffs’  claim  (regardless  of \n\n  3\nsovereign immunity’s possible applicability to the injunction \ninitially  sought).  Doing so, we   find that the plaintiffs’ \nshowing  on those m erits  is too weak to give them   the \nlikelihood of success required for a prelim inary injunction.  \nAccordingly,  we affirm   the de nial  of plaintiffs’ initially \nrequested injunction and reverse  the grant of their follow-up \ninjunctive claim.1 \n*  *  * \nIn 2005 approximately 123,000 owner occupied homes in \nLouisiana were destroyed or  severely damaged by hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita.  Deferred Appendix (“D.A.”) 47.  Using \nfederal funds, Louisiana created the Road Home Homeowner \nAssistance  Program  to assist Louisianans dis placed  by the \nhurricanes.   The pr ogram’s  principal activity has been \nprovision  of grants to hom eowners  who wish to repair or \nrebuild and reoccupy their damaged homes.  As of March 24, \n2011, it had given 117,744 Louisiana hom eowners almost $8 \nbillion  in grants for rebui lding.   Office of Comm unity \nDevelopment, The Homeowner Ass istance Program Weekly \n                                                 \n1 The parties on March 28, 2011, in accord with Part II.C.2 of \nthe  Circuit’s Handbook of Practice,  filed  notice  that  they  were \nengaged  in  serious  settlement  negotiations.  Notice of such \nnegotiations is of course most useful before the court has expended \nresources in drafting an opinion or opinions resolving the case.  On \nMarch  29, 2011 we  issued  our judgment  affirming the district \ncourt’s judgment in No. 10-5257, reversing its judgment in No. 10-\n5269, vacating the injunction we had issued on September 22, 2010, \nand noting that that we  did so for reasons to be explained “in \nopinions to be filed at  a later date.”   Greater New Orleans Fai r \nHousing  Action Center  v.  U. S. Dep’t of Housing &   Urban \nDevelopment, No. 10-5257 (D.C. Cir.  March 29, 2011).  These a re \nthose opinions.   \n\n  4\nSituation and Pipeline Report Week 247, 1 (March 29, 2011) \n(“Weekly  Situation and Pipeline Report”), \nhttp://www.road2la.org/Docs/pipeline/week247pipeline.pdf.  \nThe program is supported by thr ee special appropriations of \nCommunity Development Block Grants by Congress in 2005, \n2006, and 2007.  Pub. L. No. 109-148, 119 Stat. 2680, 2779-\n81 (Dec. 30, 2005); Pub. L. No. 109- 234, 120 Stat. 418, 472-\n73 (June 15, 2006); Pub. L.  No. 110-116, 121 Stat. 1295, \n1343-44 (Nov. 13, 2007) (“2007 Act”).     \nThe program’s grants fall into three categories.  Option 1 \ngrants are available to those Louisiana homeowners who plan \nto  repair  or  rebuild th eir  damaged  homes.   Hom eowners \nreceiving Option 1 grants must agree to a covenant requiring \ntheir  rebuilt home  to be owne r-occupied  for at least three \nyears (the covenant runs with the house so that any buyer of \nthe  house is bound if the grant  recipient  sells the house).   \nOptions 2 and 3 relate to homeowners without plans to rebuild \non their original hom esites.  This case concerns only grants  \nmade under Option 1.   \nOCD has calculated these gran ts by taking the lesser of \nthe  pre-Katrina  value of  the home  and the co st-to-rebuild, \nsubtracting the value o f any FEMA or insurance proceed s \nreceived by the homeowner, and, if the homeowner carried no \nhome insurance, applying a 30%  penalty (i.e., 30% of the \nlower of value or cost-to-rebu ild, minus any FEMA grant).   \nD.A. 110.  The resulting tota l is capped at $150,000.  The \nformula has special provision for houses m ore than half (but \nnot fully) destroyed and for ho meowners who must raise the  \nelevation  of  their ho mes  in order to com ply  with new \nregulations.  Homeowners with incomes that are no higher \nthan  80% of the “area m edian  income”  may  receive an  \nAdditional  Compensation  Grant  (“ACG”) to cover a ny \ndifference between the cost-to-rebuild and the amount of their \ncompensation  and elev ation  grants.   ACGs were initia lly \n\n  5\nsubject to a $50,000 lim it, but that was removed before the \ndistrict  court  heard p laintiffs’  motion f or  a prelim inary \ninjunction.  The $150,000 cap applies to any recipient’s total \ngrant, including any elevation grant or ACG.   The various \nformulae used in awarding grants have been developed by the \nLRA and OCD and approved by HUD.   \nPlaintiffs brought suit against HUD and Keegan on behalf \nof all African-American homeowners in New Orleans who \nwill have participated in the Road Home program by the first \nday of trial and had their grant amounts calculated on the basis \nof pre-storm value of their homes.  The parties agreed to defer \nbriefing on class certification until after commencement of \ndiscovery, D.A. 38-39, and ther e has been no ruling on class \ncertification.   Plaintiffs alle ged  that the Option 1 for mula \nviolates the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3604(a), 3605(a), \n3608(d),  (e)(5), and the  Housing  and Comm unity \nDevelopment Act of 1974, 42 U.S.C. §  5304(b)(2).  Their \ntheory is that the formula’s use of pre-Katrina house values as \na grant ceiling had a disparate im pact on African-American \nhomeowners, who tend to live in New Orleans neighborhoods  \nwith lower property values than those in predominately white \nneighborhoods.   \nFactually, the disparate impact claim relies primarily on a \n2008  study by PolicyLink, using  data  on the Road Home  \nprogram provided by the LRA and the Louisiana Housing \nFinance Agency.  Plaintiffs focus on a “resource gap” found \nby the study, which it defined as  the difference between total \nresources available for rebuilding and the cost of rebuilding.   \nPolicyLink calculated resources for rebuilding as including all \ngrants under the Road Hom e program, plus money received \nfrom  FEMA  and the hom eowner’s  insurance proceeds.   \nPolicyLink,  A Long Way Hom e:  the State of Housing \nRecovery  in Louisiana 2008 (“PolicyLink”), at 39,  \nhttp://policylink.info/threeyearslater/.  For rebuilding costs, it \n\n  6\nused the same formulae that LRA used in calculating grant  \nawards.   \nThe study found that although African-American Option \n1 grant recipients received larger average Road Hom e grants \nthan  white recipients, the “resource gap” was $39,082 on \naverage for African-American grant recipients, compared with \n$30,863 on average for white grant  recipients.  PolicyLink at \n42.  The study suggested that much of the “resource gap” was \ndriven by the element of the formula using home values as a \nceiling on grants.  Among homeowners who were paid under \nthe prong of the formula looking to pre-Katrina home values, \nthe average resource gap was nearly $50,000, com pared to \nabout  $14,000 for homeowners who were paid under the \nformula’s cost-to-rebuild prong.  PolicyLink at 43.  The study \nalso  noted that “African  American  households and low-\nincome households had lower pre-storm home values than the \naverage for closed[2] applicants rebuilding in place” and that \n“[l]ow-income households and  African Americans had less \ninsurance  on average than any other dem ographic  group.”  \nPolicyLink  at 38.  Plaintiffs   presented data from the \nPolicyLink study and the 2000 census showing that houses in \npredominantly  African-American  neighborhoods in New \nOrleans have significantly lower values than houses in white  \nneighborhoods.  PolicyLink at 46-51; D.A. 163, 165.   \nIn October 2009 the state of  Louisiana (with the consent \nof  HUD) rem oved  the $50,000 ceiling on A CGs  for low \nincome homeowners.  D.A.  236.  As a result hom eowners \nwhose income was no higher than 80% of the median became \neligible for total grants up to the lesser of  the full cost-to-\nrebuild or $150,000.  Because the new for mula made low \n                                                 \n2 PolicyLink appears to use th e term “closed” for those who \nhad received their Road Home grants.   \n\n  7\nincome  homeowners  eligible  for  grants up to the cost-to-\nrebuild, or $150,000, regardless of  the pre-Katrina value of \ntheir  homes,  it effectively removed, for low incom e \nhomeowners, the part of the gr ant formula that considered \nhomes’ pre-Katrina value.  In effect, low income homeowners \nreceived the relief requested by plaintiffs.  As of May 6, 2010, \nOCD  had paid 9,301   grant recipients $326 .5  million  in \nadditional ACGs.  D.A. 193.   \nIn June 2010 plaintiffs reque sted a temporary restraining \norder (“TRO”) and prelim inary injunction that would enjoin \nKeegan “from taking any action to obligate, reallocate and/or \nspend any funds that, as of J une 2, 2010, remain available to \nthe LRA’s Road Home Homeowner Assistance program, and \n. . . from taking any action to submit any request to the U.S. \nDepartment  of Housing and Urban Developm ent  . . . t hat \nwould  result in or cause fu rther  obligation, award, and/or  \ndisbursement of funds . . . .”   D.A. 68.  The purpose of this \npreliminary injunction would have been to preserve a source \nof funds for the additional grants that plaintiffs (and the class \nof homeowners they purport to represent) would be entitled to \nif their lawsuit were to succeed.  The proposed injunction \nwould thwart LRA’s plans to use at lea st $100 million of \navailable funds on a constructi on lending program to support \nloans to Road Home grant recipients who for various reasons \nhad  insufficient funds to rebui ld  and difficulty obtaining \ncredit.  D.A. 230-31.  \nThe district court denied pl aintiffs’ motion.  Although it \nfound that the plaintiffs were likely to be able to make a prima \nfacie  showing of disparate im pact,  it conc luded  that  state \nsovereign  immunity under the E leventh  Amendment,  as \ninterpreted  by  Edelman  v. Jordan ,  415 U.S. 651 (1974), \nbarred the relief.  While Edelman finds “prospective” relief \npermissible  under the Eleven th  Amendment,  it bars \n“retroactive”  injunctive  relief  as an im pingement  on state \n\n  8\nsovereign  immunity.  See  Edelman,  415 U.S. at 677.   \nAlthough the injunction sought would only hold paym ents in \nabeyance, plaintiffs sought it in aid of their claim  to have \ngrant awards recalculated for Option 1 app licants who had \nalready been paid, and the distri ct court ruled that a m andate \nof such payments would “effectively constitute an award of  \ndamages” for a past b reach of a legal duty.   Greater New \nOrleans Fair Housing Action Center v. U. S. Dep’t of Housing \n& Urban Development, 723 F. Supp. 2d 1, 9 (D.D.C. 2010).   \nPlaintiffs  appealed the   denial of   this f irst  preliminary \ninjunction motion, arguing that th e district court erred in its \nanalysis of the im plications of Edelman.  They also filed a \nmotion in the district court for a second TRO and prelim inary \ninjunction.  This alternative relief was to bar OCD from using \nthe house value element of the existing grant form ula in any \nfuture grants, relief that did not, under the district court’s prior \nruling,  run afoul of  Edelman’s  bar on retrosp ective  relief.  \nLittle was at stake, however.  In her oppositio n to this second \nmotion, defendant Keegan pointed out that as of July 29, 2010 \nthere  were only 141 African-A merican  Option 1 grant \napplicants  in Orleans Parish  who  were not elig ible  for  an \nACG and had not yet received  any grants.  Furtherm ore, of \nthese 141 applications several did not meet program eligibility \nrequirements, 54 had not replied to correspondence from OCD \nto  indicate  their contin uing  interest  in the p rogram  for  a \nsubstantial  period of tim e,  and over 80 had various  \ndeficiencies in their documentation.

Because the \ndeadline for submitting initial Option 1 grant applications has \nalready passed, there will not  be any new applicants.  2007 \nAct, 121 Stat. at 1343, § 159(a).   \nThe district court granted this second motion; because the \nsecond requested injunction would affect only the awards of \nfuture grantees, the relief sought  would be permissible under \nEdelman and Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908).   Greater \n\n  9\nNew Orleans Fair Housing Action Center v. U. S. Dep’t of  \nHousing  & Urban De velopment,  723 F. Supp. 2d 11, 13 \n(D.D.C. 2010).  As before, it found that plaintiffs had shown a \nlikelihood of success on the m erits of their disp arate impact \nclaim,  and in addition found  the  other elem ents  of t he \nconventional  preliminary  injunction  formula  tilting in \nplaintiffs’ favor.  Id. at 13-14.   \nDefendant  Keegan filed a cro ss-appeal  of the district  \ncourt’s  ruling on the second motion for a TRO and \npreliminary injunction.  She ar gues, among other things, that \nplaintiffs do not have standing a nd that the district court did \nnot  have jurisdiction to enter this prelim inary  injunction \nbecause jurisdiction over the matter had shifted to the court of \nappeals.   \nWhile the appeal and cross-appeal were pending before  \nus, plaintiffs filed a motion for an injunction pending appeal.   \nWe  granted that m otion  and enjoined Keegan “from \ncommitting Road Home funds to any new projects, such as the \nproposed construction lending pr ogram, pending disposition \nof this appeal.”   Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action \nCenter v. U. S. Dep’t of Housing & Urban Development , No. \n10-5257 (D.C. Cir. Sept. 22, 2010) (order granting injunction \npending  appeal).  This ruling, in effect, gave plaintif fs \ntemporarily the relief they s ought in the first motion for a \npreliminary injunction.   \n*  *  * \nIn ruling on a prelim inary injunction a key issue—often \nthe  dispositive one—is whethe r  the m ovant  has shown a  \nsubstantial likelihood of success on the merits.  See Munaf v. \nGeren, 553 U.S. 674, 690 (2008).  As we’ve seen, the district \ncourt resolved that issue against plaintiffs on the ground that \n\n  10\nthe  relief sought would viol ate  Louisiana’s sovereign \nimmunity.   It ruled that requi ring  Louisiana to adjust th e \naward of grant recipients who had already been paid under the \nRoad Home program would be retrospective relief of the type \nbarred by Edelman.  The issue is in fact extremely complex,  \nfor several reasons: (1) Although the Road Hom e program is \nadministered by a state agency, it is funded by the federal \ngovernment; (2) Although Congress initially allowed the state \nagency a fairly wide discretion to deploy the funds—subject \nto  HUD approval—in response to the Katrina and Rita  \ndisasters, the 2007 Act explicitly  required them to be used \n“solely  for the purpose of covering costs associated with \notherwise uncompensated but eligible claim s that were filed \non or before July 31, 2007, under the Road Hom e program.”  \n2007  Act, 121 Stat. at 1343, §  159(a);  (3) T he  OCD and \ndefendant Keegan have changed the Road Home formula over \ntime,  giving addition al  sums  to prior r ecipients  (leading \nplaintiffs to divide the grants into categories they call “initial” \nand “final”).  And there is no precedent in our circuit applying \nEdelman to comparable facts.  Ot her circuits have adopted \ngreatly  varying interpretations of  Edelman  where a state ’s \ndiscretion  over the funds at issue is lim ited.   Compare  \nVaqueria Tres Monjitas Inc. v. Irizarry, 587 F.3d 464, 478-80 \n(1st Cir. 2009) (holding that Edelman does not bar retroactive \nrelief  paid from   special  state trust fund),  reh’g  denied \nVaqueria Tres Monjitas Inc. v. Irizarry , 600 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. \n2010); Bennett v. White, 865 F.2d 1395, 1408 (3rd Cir. 1989)  \n(permitting retrospective relief under Edelman to the extent \nthat any funds paid by the state will be reimbursed by the  \nUnited States), and Brown v. Porcher, 660 F.2d 1001, 1006-\n07  (4th Cir. 1981) (holding that  Edelman  does not bar \nretrospective relief when the award is not paid from  a state’s \ngeneral revenue fund), with Paschal v. Jackson, 936 F.2d 940, \n944 (7th Cir. 1991) (declining to  inquire as to the source of \nstate funds), and Esparza v. Valdez, 862 F.2d 788, 794 (10th \n\n  11\nCir. 1988) (rejecting a rule that would look to whether “relief \nwould be paid out of a general or special revenue fund”). \nBy  contrast, we find t he  substantive  merits  relatively \neasy.  But we can reac h them only if permitted to do so by \nSteel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment , 523 U.S. 83 \n(1998),  which generally gives  an  absolute priority to \njurisdictional questions.  We conclude that Steel Co. presents \nno obstacle.  We can perceive no good reason that Louisiana’s \nsovereign  immunity might preclude  all  relief.   Although \ndefendant  Keegan makes several wholly im plausible \narguments  to the effect that the second motion for a  \npreliminary injunction is barred by the Eleventh Amendment, \nthese  arguments rest on a f undamental  confusion over the \nsignificance of Ex Parte Young, and they read Idaho v. Coeur \nd’Alene  Tribe of Idaho ,  521 U.S. 261 (1997), as if it \neffectively overruled Ex Parte Young.  At a minimum, it is \nclear that under Edelman the district court has jurisdiction to \norder  LRA to use a different form ula  for future grantees.   \nThus, unlike the typical jurisdictional issue, the Edelman issue \nis not one that calls into question the authority of the court to \nhear  plaintiffs’ claim   on the m erits.   So it is clear that  \nregardless of how the Eleven th Amendment might apply to \nthe  first prelim inary  injunction,  the district court properly \nexercised  jurisdiction over both the case as   a whole and  \nplaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, and that we  \nmay do the same.   \nWe note for the record that, apart from situations like this \nwhere the only jurisdictional obstacle is to particular varieties \nof relief, there is considerable uncertainty about sequencing in \nthe Eleventh Amendment context.  The Suprem e Court has \nfound it permissible, “indeed appropriate,” to decide the issue \nof whether a statute provides for suits against the states before \ndetermining  whether, if   it did, th e  Eleventh  Amendment \nwould  permit  such a suit.   Vermont  Agency of Natu ral \n\n  12\nResources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U.S. 765, 780 \n(2000).  It reasoned that the  statutory issue was “logically \nantecedent  to th e  existence  of th e  Eleventh  Amendment \nquestion,” id. (internal quotations omitted), and that the court, \nin resolving that issue would not “pronounce upon any issue, \nor  upon the rights of   any person, beyond the issues and \npersons  that would be re ached  under the Eleventh \nAmendment  inquiry anyway”  (as  it m ight  in resolving \nquestions such as whether the statute permitted private causes \nof action generally).   Id.  Thus the “com bination of logical \npriority and virtual coincidenc e of scope m akes it possible, \nand indeed appropriate, to decide the statutory issue first.”  Id. \nat  779-80.  See also  United  States ex rel. Long v. SCS \nBusiness & Technical Institute, In c. 173 F.3d 890, 893-98 \n(D.C. Cir. 1999).  But at least one  circuit is ready to consider \nmerits before passing on an Eleventh Amendment issue on the \ngrounds that state sovereign immunity, unlike ordinary subject \nmatter jurisdiction issues such as standing, may be waived by \nthe state and, if not raised by the state, m ay but need not be \nconsidered  by the court  sua  sponte.    Parella  v.  R.I. \nEmployees’ Retirement System, 173 F.3d 46, 53-57 (1st Cir. \n1999); see also  Greenless v. Almond, 277 F.3d 601, 607-08 \n(1st Cir. 2002); cf.  United States ex rel. Long , 173 F.3d at \n893-94 (noting several Supreme Court hints that the Eleventh \nAmendment was no m ore than “quasi-jurisdictional”).  But \nsee Vermont Agency, 529 U.S. at 779 (not ing that personal \njurisdiction “is an essen tial element of the jurisdiction of  a \ndistrict court, without which the court is powerless to proceed \nto  an adju dication”).   But because here the Eleventh  \nAmendment is at m ost a barrier to  some possible remedies \nand the district court’s jurisdiction over the case as a whole is \nclear, we can consider the merits first, without sorting out the \nsequencing issue for other contexts.   \n\n  13\n*  *  * \nIn  evaluating  likelihood  of success on the su bstantive \nmerits,  we review the distri ct  court’s  legal  conclusions  de \nnovo.  Davis v. PBGC, 571 F.3d 1288, 1291 (D.C. Cir. 2009).  \nContrary  to  the d istrict  court,  we conclude that plaintiffs’  \ndisparate impact claim lacks merit.   \nSection  3604(a) of the Fa ir  Housing Act m akes  it \nunlawful “To refuse to sell or  rent after the making of a bona \nfide offer, or to refuse to negotiate for the sale or rental of, or \notherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any person \nbecause  of race, colo r,  religion,  sex, fam ilial  status, or \nnational origin.”  42 U.S.C. §  3604(a).  We have not decided \nwhether this permits disparate impact claims.  2922 Sherman \nAvenue  Tenants’ Association v. District of Columbia ,  444 \nF.3d 673, 679 (D.C. Cir. 2006).   The argument that it does  \nrests largely on the point that the language is parallel to that of \nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §  2000e-\n2,  under w hich  a plaintiff can prevail by showing either  \ndisparate impact or disparate treatment.  See  2922 Sherman \nAvenue Tenants’ Association, 444 F.3d at 679.  Each of the  \neleven circuits that have resolved the m atter has found the  \ndisparate  impact theory appli cable  under the Fair Housing \nAct.  Id.  As the matter has not been briefed and its resolution \nis unnecessary to the outcome, however, we shall, as in  2922 \nSherman  Avenue Tenants’ Association ,  simply  assume  the \navailability of the disparate impact theory.  We note, however, \nthat  no co urt  has app lied  disparate  impact  theory to th e \nformulae used administering a grant program.  \nSimilarly, we need not decide as between the two leading \ntests for applying disparate im pact, the four-factor balancing \ntest  of the Seventh Circuit,  Metropolitan  Housing \nDevelopment Corp. v. Village of Arlington Heights, 558 F.2d \n1283, 1290 (7th Cir. 1977), or the  burden-shifting test of the \n\n  14\nSecond  Circuit,  Huntington  Branch, NAACP v. Town of \nHuntington, 844 F.2d 926, 935-36 (2nd Cir. 1988),  aff’d on \nother grounds, 488 U.S. 15, 18 (1988).   As in  2922 Sherman \nAvenue Tenants’ Association, the success of plaintiffs’ claim \ndoesn’t turn on the de tails of the legal test; either appro ach \nrequires proof of disproportiona te impact, measured in some \nplausible way, 444 F.3d at 679-80 , and plaintiffs have not \noffered such proof.   \nWhen  presenting a dis parate  impact  claim,  a plaintiff \nmust generally “demonstrate with statistical evidence that the \npractice  or policy has an adve rse  effect on the protected \ngroup.”  Garcia v. Johanns, 444 F.3d 625, 633 (D.C. Cir. \n2006) (evaluating a disparate  impact claim under the Equal \nCredit Opportunity Act); see also Watson v. Fort Worth Bank \n& Trust, 487 U.S. 977, 987 (1988).  “T he correct inquiry is \nwhether the policy in question had a disproportionate im pact \non the minorities in the total group to which the policy was \napplied.”  Betsey v Turtle Creek Associates, 736 F.2d 983, 987 \n(4th  Cir. 1984); see also  Darensburg  v. Metropolitan \nTransportation Commission, No. 09-15878, --- F.3d ---, 2011 \nWL 540592 (9th Cir. 2011) (eva luating a disparate im pact \nclaim  alleging discriminatory   allocation  of  mass  transit \nfunds).  In this case, the polic y—the grant formula that called \nfor using the lesser of pre-Ka trina home value and cost to \nrepair—was applied to all applicants for Option 1 Road Home \ngrants.  The question, then, is whether the formula as a whole \nhad a disparate impact on African-American grant applicants. \nWe pause to consider examples of what is precluded by a \nfocus on the effects of the form ula as a whole.  In any s tate \nwhere  African-American  and white hom eowners  have \nsignificantly different economic profiles, it will presum ably \nbe the case that particular elements of a complex formula such \nas  that o f  the Road Hom e  program will hav e  a \ndisproportionate negative impact on African-Americans, an \n\n  15\nimpact potentially offset by other elem ents of the for mula.  \nFor example, assuming that use of  the pre-Katrina value of \nhome as one element of the formula favors white homeowners \non average, the PolicyLink study invoked by plaintiffs tells us \nthat African-American homeowners received less money from \ninsurance on average, PolicyLink at 38, so that the form ula’s \ndeduction of insurance proceeds from the grant appears to \nfavor  African-Americans.    Similarly,  the $150,000 cap on \ntotal grants would seem to disf avor wealthier (and therefore, \naccording to the Policy Link study, disproportionately white) \ngrant  recipients.  It seem s  unlikely  that an agency could \nfashion a grant formula in this context without  some element \nhaving a disproportionate impact on a protected group.  (For \nthe moment we defer consideration of the consequences if, as \nunder Title VII, whites are also acceptable plaintiffs.) \nFor the same reason, attention to the formula’s effects as \na whole bars our looking at the effects of the grant form ula \nonly in Orleans Parish.  If th e economic profiles of racial \ngroups differ from parish to pari sh in the parts of Louisiana \naffected by hurricanes Katrina and Rita, then a grant form ula \nthat has non-disparate racial effects for Louisiana as a whole \ncan  easily  have a dis parate  impact  on African-Am erican \nresidents in at least som e individual parishes (not to mention \nsmaller geographic units).  To allow plaintiffs to pick a special \nsubset of the affected localities to test for dis parate impact \nwould, just like allowing them to single out of the effects of a \nsingle formula element, expose almost any grant form ula to \nlitigation.  Although plaintiffs  focus much of their case on \nOrleans Parish, we must consider the impact on Louisiana as a \nwhole.   \nApart from these obvious limits, it is hard to see just how \none  may  affirmatively  identify a sound benchm ark  for \nassessing the disparateness of a grant formula’s impact (or, to \nput  the problem   slightly di fferently,  to say what a non-\n\n  16\ndisparate impact would look like).  Plaintiffs urge us to focus  \non the “resource gap” facing Option 1 grant recipients, that is, \nthe  difference  between  the cost -to-rebuild  and the “total \nresources” of an applicant—the latter being defined (by them \nand the PolicyLink study) as the grantees’ total receipts from \ninsurance, FEMA and the Road Hom e program.  They point  \nto  the PolicyLink finding of   a “resource g ap”  between \nAfrican-American and white grant  recipients of slightly over \n$8,000  ($39,082 on a verage  for African-Am erican  grant \nrecipients, compared with an average of $30,863 for white  \ngrant recipients).  PolicyLink at 42. \nEven if we accep ted “resource gap” as the appropriate \nmeasure, which we do not, plaintiffs’ evidence is problematic \nat best.  The PolicyLink study  predates the removal of the \n$50,000 cap on ACGs  (which in turn predated the district \ncourt  injunction proceeding), creating what OCD calls the \nAdditional ACG program.  That removal has had considerable \nimpact.  By May 6, 2010 (before the district court ruled on the \nfirst motion for a TRO and preliminary injunction), OCD had \npaid  9,301  grant recipients $326 .5  million  in Addition al \nACGs.  D.A. 193.  According to the m ost recent data, OCD \nhas  now disbursed $466,313,036.52 to 13,267 grant \nrecipients.  Weekly Situation and Pipeline Report at 5.  This is \nmore than 10% of Option 1 grants to low incom e recipients \nand represents an av erage Additional ACG of over $35,00 0.  \nId.  We do not know the fraction of  these grants received by \nAfrican-Americans.  But if African-American grant recipients \nare more likely to qualify as low incom e and are more likely \nto face a resource gap, as the PolicyLink study suggests, they \nwould  be eligible substant ially  more  often, and for \nsubstantially  larger av erage  Additional ACGs, than would \nwhite recipients.  Thus removal of the ceiling on ACGs casts \ngrave doubt on plaintif fs’ claim even under their “resource  \ngap” theory.   \n\n  17\nAt  oral argum ent,  plaintiffs’  counsel responded to the \nremoval of the $50,000 cap by arguing that it would have no \neffect among recipients altogether ineligible for ACGs, i.e., \nthose  with incom es  higher th an  80% of “area m edian \nincome.”  But this sort of analytical cherry-picking seems to \nus no more valid than the sam e practice that we rejected as  \napplied to individual elements of the formula or to geographic \nunits.   \nIn any event, we find the “resource gap” an inappropriate \nbenchmark.   The “resource gap” m easures  neither the  \nresources a recipient receives under the Road Home program, \nnor a grant recipient’s ability to obtain housing, nor the extent \nto which the Road Home program compensates a recipient for \nhurricane-inflicted  losses.  It m easures  only the extent to \nwhich grant receipts, FEMA receipts and insurance receipts \nfall short of the cost-to-rebuild  a house of the size that the \ngrant  recipient owned before  the  hurricanes.   This   is  a \ncompletely  artificial metric.   It  represents an unprincipled \nmish-mash of considerations in tension with one another.  The \n“resource  gap” m etric  gestures  at m easuring  need  by \ncalculating shortfalls from the cost of rebuilding rather than \nsize of the total grant.  But the cost-to-rebuild element rests on \nthe size of applicant’s former house, rather than assuming (as \nwould  an egalitarian concern for need) an equal cost o f \nhousing  for all.  And the treatm ent  of insurance seems  \ncompletely anomalous.  It makes homeowners who bothered \nto insure their homes appear to be the recipients of some sort \nof government munificence, while in fact their grants have \nbeen  reduced on account of their precau tions  (a reductio n \npresumably made because OCD’s resources were finite an d \nbecause the justifications for the “collateral source” rule are \nabsent here).   \nAn alternative focus would be the  total value of Road \nHome grants received, or the value of Road Home grants as a \n\n  18\nproportion of a grantee’s uncom pensated losses.  But on this  \ncriterion, the plaintiffs’ own evidence is fatal to their claim.  It \nindicates that African-American grant recipients on average \nhave  received  larger  total awards   than d id  white gran t \nrecipients.  PolicyLink at 38 (“ African American and elderly \nhouseholds received higher av erage grants because a higher \npercentage of them received additional compensation grants, \nwhich  were available   to low-in come  individuals.”).   If  \nanything,  this discrepancy ha s  become  greater since the  \nPolicyLink study, by virtue of removal of the $50,000 cap on \nACGs.    \nIn short, then, plaintiffs’ facts are at best sketchy even on \nthe implausible resource-gap theory, and do not begin to show \na violation on the size-of-grant metric.   \nAlternative  benchmarks  are clearly conceiv able.   In  \nrejecting the resource-gap theory and in tentatively applying \nthe size-of-grant theory, we do no t mean to endorse size-of-\ngrant  as  necessarily  suitable.   Choice of a benchm ark  is \nfurther complicated by uncertainty whether one need consider \nonly the impact on minority groups.  As Title VII perm its \nwhite  employees  to bring  job  discrimination  claims, \nMcDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transportation Co. , 427 U.S. \n273, 279-80 (1976), white grant recipients m ight, on the size-\nof-grant  standard, be able to   make  a prim a  facie case of \ndisparate impact.  See also Jordan v. Khan, 969 F. Supp. 29, \n30-31  (N.D. Ill. 1997) (perm itting  white plaintiff to bring \nracial  discrimination  claim  under  the Fair H ousing  Act); \nMiller v. Towne Oaks East Apartments, 797 F. Supp. 557, 561 \n(E.D. Tex. 1992) (same).  In the face of this legal uncertainty, \nadoption of the size-of-grant benchm ark would put OCD—\nand other agencies trying to develop formulae for comparable \ngrants—in  a damned-if- you-do,  damned-if-you-don’t \nquandary.   \n\n  19\nThus the data offered by plai ntiffs to show a disparate \nimpact fall short.  The numbers by no means establish that the \nOCD formula actually in effect at the time of the district court \nproceeding  created results am ounting  to a violation even \nunder plaintiffs’ resource-gap theory, which in any event we  \nreject.   On  the less implausible   size-of-grant standard, the \nevidence flatly contradicts their claim.  As a re sult, plaintiffs \nhave not shown a likelihood of success on the merits.  While \nthe  criteria governing grant of   a prelim inary  injunction \ninclude other elements (the balance of harms to the parties and \nthe effect on the public  interest), see, e.g.,  Davis v. PBGC, \n571 F.3d at 1291, and we review the district court’s balance of \nfactors for abuse of discretion, id., there is no need to remand \nto  the dis trict  court.   When   a plaintiff has not shown a \nlikelihood  of success on the m erits,  there is no need to \nconsider  the  remaining  factors.   See  Arkansas  Dairy \nCooperative Ass’n, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Agriculture, 573 F.3d \n815, 832 (D.C. Cir. 2009);  Apotex, Inc. v. FDA, 449 F.3d \n1249, 1253 (D.C. Cir. 2006).   \nWe  therefore affirm   the dist rict  court’s denial of the \ninitially requested injunction. \n*  *  * \nWe turn now to plaintiffs’  second motion for a TRO and \npreliminary injunction.  The district court granted this motion \nseveral  weeks  after  plaintiffs’  notice  of appeal of its first  \ninjunction ruling.  Defendants appeal this decision on several \ngrounds,  including jurisdictional  ones—that  plaintiffs lack \nstanding and that their appeal of the denial of the first motion \nfor a TRO and prelim inary injunction divested the district \ncourt of jurisdiction over the matter.  Under  Steel Co. we \nwould  normally  be required to  address  these  jurisdictional \nquestions before ruling on the substantive merits, but this case \n\n  20\nfits well within an exc eption recognized by Steel Co.  If the \noutcome on the m erits is “foreordained” by another ruling, \nsuch that “the pretermission of the jurisdictional question [is \nnot  used] as a dev ice  for reaching  a ques tion  of law tha t \notherwise would have gone unaddressed,” then a court m ay \nturn to the merits without considering the jurisdictional issue.  \nSteel Co., 523 U.S. at 98.  In ru ling on the first motion for a \npreliminary injunction, we found that plaintiffs’ likelihood of \nsuccess  on the m erits  of their un derlying  claim  was slim.   \nAlthough  the scope of relief re quested  differs, the second \nmotion implicates the exact same disparate impact claim and \nthus  shares the first motion’s  fatal  defect.  And, as noted \nabove, when a plaintiff has not shown a likelihoo d of success \non the merits, we need not consider the other factors.  Our \nruling on the first motion is therefore fully dispositive of the \nsecond motion.  Accordingly, we  reverse the district court’s \ngrant of the second motion.  \n*  *  * \nAs set forth in our March 29, 2011 judgm ent, we affirm \nthe district court’s denial of plaintiffs’ first motion for a TRO \nand  preliminary  injunction and  reverse  the dis trict  court’s \ngrant of plaintiffs’ second m otion.  We also, as previously \nordered, vacate the injunction we  had issued pending appeal.   \nFinally, we remand the case for pro ceedings not inconsistent \nwith this opinion. \n\nRogers, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and concurring\nin the judgment:  Although I concur in holding that plaintiffs\nfail to demonstrate entitlement to injunctive relief based on a\nlikelihood of success on the m erits of their disparate impact\nclaim, I write separately to identify the narrow issue this court\nis required to decide in disposing of these appeals.\nPlaintiffs’ theory of the case is straightfor ward: The\nformula used to determine grant awards of federal funds under\nOption 1 of the Road Home Program1, which bases the award\non the lesser of the pre-storm value of an applicant’s home and\nthe cost to rebuild, ha s a discriminatory impact on African-\nAmerican  grantees living in historically   segregated\ncommunities because generally African-Americans own homes\nwith pre-storm values that fall below the cost to rebuild, while\nwhites  living in predom inantly  white com munities  own\ncomparable homes with pre-storm values that exceed the cost to\nrebuild.  See Compl. ¶¶ 52-60.  Robin Keegan, then-Executive\nDirector of the Office of Community Development for the State\nof Louisiana, interposed three objections  to plaintiffs’ claim of\nlikelihood  of success on the m erits:  (1) The Eleventh\nAmendment bars any relief; (2) The Fair Housing Act, 42\nU.S.C. §§ 3601 et seq., does not afford a cognizable claim; and\n(3) Plaintiffs’ evidentiary proffer does not account for the total\nfederal funds distributed and hence fails to show that the pre-\nstorm value calculation under Option 1 of t he Road Home\nProgram  had a disparate im pact  on the proposed class of\n1  Maj. Op. at 3-4, referring to the funding of the Road Home\nProgram  by  congressional  appropriations  of Com muniity\nDevelopment Block Grants in 2005, 2006, and 2007.  See generally\nTitle I of the Housinga nd Community Development Act of 1974, Pub.\nL. No. 93-383, 88 Stat. 663 (codified  as amended at 42 U.S.C. §§\n5301 et seq.).\n\n2\nAfrican-American homeowners in Orleans Parish.2\n1. The Eleventh Amendment argument is based on\nfundamental factual and legal misunderstandings, see Maj. Op.\nat 10-11, and is effectively conceded by Keegan.  Pla intiffs\ncontend that because Keegan m ust use the re maining $148\nmillion of federal funds to suppl ement the federal grants of\nexisting  Road Hom e  recipients,  see  An  Act  Making\nappropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year\nending September 30, 2008, and for other purposes, Pub. L. No.\n110-116, § 159, 121 Stat. 1295, 1343-44 (2007) (“2007 Act”),\nany relief would remedy an ongoing violation of federal law and\nhave no impact on the state’s treasury or budge t, thereby\navoiding the Eleventh Amendment’s sovereign immunity bar. \nSee Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651 (1974); Ex parte Young,\n209 U.S. 123 (1908).  In response Keegan claimed that the Ex\nparte Young exception to the bar interposed by the Eleventh\nAmendment was inapplicable because the state, not Keegan, is\nthe real party in interest inasm uch as the state’s political or\nproperty rights and its public treasury would be adversely\naffected were plaintiffs to prevail.  This argument is premised\non Keegan’s position that the recalculation of Option 1 grants\nsought by plaintiffs would “amount to money damages to be\n2  Keegan also  maintained as to the second m otion for a\npreliminary injunction that plaintiffs lacked standing and that  the\ndistrict  court  lacked jurisdiction.   See  Maj. Op. at 9.  Keegan\nacknowledges that three of the five named plaintiffs are homeowners\nin New Orleans whose grant amounts under the Road Home Program\nwere calculated based on the pre-storm value of their homes and that\nthey are ineligible to receive Additional Compensation Grants.  See\nCompl. ¶¶ 13-17, 21; Def.-Appellee Cross-Appellant Robin Keegan\nBr. at 29.  Class certification, by agreement of the parties, has been\npostponed by the district court.  The court does not reach the grounds\non which Keegan argues that the disrtict court lacked jurisdiction.  See\nMaj. Op. at 19-20.\n\n3\npaid from the State treasury,” Def.-Appellee Cross-Appellant\nRobin Keegan Br. at 15, and that“ [t]he allocation of state funds\nby the State of Loui siana to compensate homeowners after\nHurricanes Katrina and Rita is an im portant sovereign state\ninterest,” id. at 25.  Even after plaintiffs pointed to the federal\nsource of the funds, Keegan repeated in reply that “the funds in\nquestion are state rather than federal funds.”  Def.-Appellee\nCross-Appellant Robin Keegan Reply Br. at 23.  This insistence\ncontinued during oral argum ent, where Keegan argued t hat\n“plaintiffs’ requested relief is a retrospective claim for damages\nto be paid from the state treasury.”  Oral Arg. at 24:45-52.  \nKeegan has not identified any state funds that are\ndisbursed under the Road Home Program, and Congress, in\nappropriating the disaster recovery Community Development\nBlock Grant funds from  which the $148 m illion would be\ndrawn, mandated that “such funds serve only to supplement and\nnot supplant any other State or Federal resources committed to\nthe Road Home program.”  2007 Act § 159(b), 121 Stat. at\n1343.  As plaintiffs’ counsel confirmed to the district court and\nduring oral argument, the $148 million remains in “the custody\nand control of the United Stat es” and the funds “have neve r\nbeen disbursed to Louisiana; Louisiana has no right to use them\nat this point.”  Oral Arg. at  34:46-35:14; Clarification of the\n[District] Court’s May 24, 2010 Order, No. 1:08-cv-1938, at 6\n(D.D.C. June 6, 2010).3   Moreover, counsel for Keegan and for\nplaintiffs confirmed during oral argument that any unused Road\n3  See also 2007 Act § 159(b), 121 Stat. at 1343 (“No funds\nshall be drawn from the [United States] Treasury under this section\nbeyond  those necessary   to fulfill the exclusive purpo se  of  this\nsection,” namely “to enable the Secretary. . . to make a grant or grants\nto the State of Louisiana solely for the purpose of covering costs\nassociated with otherwise uncompensated but eligible claims that were\nfiled on or before July 31, 2007, under the Road Home program”).  \n\n4\nHome  Program  funds would revert t o  the United States\nTreasury.  See Oral Arg. at 7:45-9:00, 27:52-28:35.\nAs legal support for the Eleventh Amendment objection,\nKeegan relied on the dissenting opinion in  Seminole Tribe of\nFlorida  v. Florida ,  517 U.S. 44, 78 (1996) (Stevens, J.,\ndissenting), and Idaho v. Coeur d’Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521\nU.S.  261 (1997).  As the m ajority  notes, Keegan\n“implausibl[y]” reads Coeur d’Alene  to overturn Ex parte\nYoung.  Maj. Op. at 11.  Other than seeking an extension of the\n“special  sovereign interest” exception addressed in   Coeur\nd’Alene, Keegan cited no authority to suppor t an Eleventh\nAmendment bar to plaintiffs’ claims where only federal funds\nare involved and plaintiffs’ proposed form of relief will not\nimpose a monetary loss on the state treasury.  Because the\nfederal funds at issue remained in the United States Treasury,\nKeegan failed to explain how they could be considered state\nfunds in any legal sense. 4  The Supreme Court’s decision in\nEdelman, 415 U.S. at 664-67 & n.11, and its progeny,s ee, e.g.,\nPapasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 278-81 (1986), emphasize that\nthe  Eleventh Amendm ent  prohibits retroactive relief   that\nimposes a “monetary loss” on the state’s treasury.  By failing\nto oppose plaintiffs’ argument regarding the non-effect on the\nstate  treasury,  Keegan has effectively conceded the point\nbecause “[t]he party asserting Eleventh Amendment immunity\nbears the burden of proving its applicability.”  Betts v. New\nCastle Youth Dev. Ctr. , 621 F.3d 249, 254 (3d Cir . 2010)\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n4  On September 22, 2010, this court granted plaintiffs’ motion\nfor a temporary injunction.  Upon being advised by letter of March 28,\n2011 from counsel for plaintiffs and Keegan that serious settlement\nnegotiations were underway, see D.C. Cir. Handbook Section II.C.2,\nthe court vacated the injunction on March 29, 2011.\n\n5\n2.  The objection that plaintiffs  have no cognizable\nclaim  under the Fair Housing Act, because, according to\nKeegan, the Road Home Program  is a com pensation grant\nprogram rather than a housing program, was a passing assertion\nin Keegan’s brief without legal citation.  A passing reference to\nan unsupported narrative is insufficient to present an argument\nto this court.  Cf., e.g., Bush v. District of Columbia, 595 F.3d\n384, 388 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (citing FED. R. APP. P. 28(a)(9)(A)). \nEven  assuming  for purposes of argument that Keegan\nincorporated  authority by referencing her m emorandum\nopposing plaintiffs’ motion for injunctive relief, the argument\nwas confined to a footnote and a single cit ation involving a\ncity’s failure to prevent dumping at a neighboring site.   See\nOpp’n to Pls.’ Mot. for a TRO and Prelim. Inj., No. 1:08-cv-\n1938, Doc. No. 57, at 16 n.5 (June 14, 2010) (citing Cox v. City\nof Dallas, 430 F.3d 734, 740 (5th Cir. 2005), cert. denied, 547\nU.S. 1130 (2006)).  This court ordinarily does not address an\nargument presented in a footnote.  See, e.g., Am. Wildlands v.\nKempthorne, 530 F.3d 991, 1001 (D.C. Cir. 2008).  In any\nevent, the cases cited by the Fifth Circuit in Cox are likewise\nnot on point.   See Cox, 430 F.3d at 740  (citing Southend\nNeighborhood Improvement Ass’n v. County of St. Clair, 743\nF.2d 1207, 1210 (7th Cir. 1984)).  Plaintiffs’ content ion is\ndifferent, namely that if the rem aining federal funds for the\nRoad Home Program are not available to support the ultimate\nremedy in their action, then thousands of plaintiffs will forever\nlose the opportunity to obtain grants for home repairs on a non-\ndiscriminatory basis.\n3. The evidentiary objection is persuasive beca use a\nfactual premise underlying plaintiffs’ request for injunctive\nrelief has been overtake n by events.  In the district court,\nKeegan twice declined to dispute plaintiffs’ evidentiary proffer\nwith  “data about the adm inistration  of the [Road Hom e]\nProgram that would show what effect the Option 1 formula has\n\n6\nhad,” despite the district court’s finding of a prima facie case\nof disproportionate impact.  See Greater New Orleans Fair\nHous. Action Ctr. v. U.S. Dep’t of Hous. & Urban Dev., 723 F.\nSupp.  2d, 1, 6 (D.D.C .  2010). The district court noted,\nmoreover, that Keegan has not “demonstrate[d] that plaintiffs’\nstatistics or logic is flawed.”  Id.  Nonetheless, in moving for a\npreliminary injunction plaintiffs have the burden to demonstrate\nthe likelihood of success on the merits of their disparate impact\nclaim.  See Gordon v. Holder, 632 F.3d 722, 724 (D.C. Cir.\n2011) (citing Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, 129 S. Ct.\n365,  374 (2008));  Wash.  Metro. Area Transit Comm’n v.\nHoliday Tours, Inc., 559 F.2d 841, 844 (D.C. Cir. 1977).\nKeegan asserts on appeal that “the Road Home Program\nis a state-wide program” and thus “when [plaintiffs] do submit\nappropriate evidence, it will need to be on a state-wide level.” \nDef.-Appellee Cross-Appellant Robin Keegan Br. at 33.  The\nmajority credits this argument.  Maj. Op. at 14.  Keegan made\nthe argument only cursorily and without citation to authority,\nand hence it is not properly presented for this court to resolve. \nSee,  e.g.,  Bush,  595 F.3d at 388 (citing F ED.  R.  APP.  P.\n28(a)(9)(A)).\nKeegan does, however, present a persuasive argument\nwith  respect to the 2008 PolicyLink study 5  proffered by\nplaintiffs.  As Keegan points out, the PolicyLink study does not\nconsider the total current compensation package available to\nOption 1 applicants.  Although the study notes the availability\nof Additional Compensation Grants (“ACGs”) to low- and\n5  PolicyLink, A Long Way Home: The State of Housing\nRecovery  in  Louisiana  2008  (“PolicyLink”),\nhttp://policylink.info/threeyearslater/; see also affidavit of June 18,\n2010, by the authors explaining the methodology.\n\n7\nmoderate-income (“LMI”)6 applicants, at the time of the study\nACGs were subject to a $50,000 cap.   See PolicyLink at 41. \nOnce this limitation was removed, effective January 2010, LMI\napplicants could receive an ACG in an amount subject only to\nthe existing $150,000 cap for total Road Home Program grants. \nKeegan asserts on brief that  “[s]ince minority and disabled\nfamilies are more likely to be in the LMI category, the ACG\ngrants adjust for any alleged disparity caused by the [pre-storm\nvalue] formula.”  Def.-Appellee Cross-Appellant Robin Keegan\nBr. at 34.  In other wor ds, with regard to LMI applicants,\nKeegan  claims  the rem oval  of the ACG cap effect ively\neliminated  the average resource gap of nearly $50,000\nidentified by the PolicyLink study for all grant recipients whose\nawards were based on pre-storm value, which was larger for\nAfrican-American applicants than their white counterparts. S ee\nPolicyLink at 42-43; see also Maj. Op. at 5-7.\nDuring  oral argum ent  counsel for plaintiffs\nacknowledged that the removal of the $50,000 cap for ACGs\nresulted in LMI applicants “receiv[ing] the full amount [of their\ncost to rebuild] up to $150,000” under the Option 1 grant\nformula, making them “[in]eligible for any additional financial\nrelief under the order that [plaintfifs] seek.”  Oral Arg. at 39:04-\n45.  This leaves in plaintiffs’p roposed class only those African-\nAmerican applicants or grantees who do not qualify for ACGs\ndue to their income levels.  See id.  Plaintiffs claim there are\n9,500 other homeowners in Orleans Parish who received initial\ngrants based on pre-storm value but did not receive ACGs like\nLMI homeowners.  See Pls.-Appellants’ Br. at 22.  Keegan\nresponds that only 19 applicants potentially fit into plaintiffs’\nproposed class of non-LMI Af rican-American applicants in\nOrleans Parish whose grants were calculated using pre-storm \n6  To qualify as LMI in Orleans Parish an applicant can have\na maximum income of only $29,637.\n\n8\nvalue.  See Def.-Appellee Cross-Appellant Robin Keegan Reply\nBr. at 30; see also Maj. Op. at 8.  Regardless of which number\nis correct, neither the 2000 U.S. Cens us data proffered by\nplaintiffs, showing African-Americans in New Orleans are\nmore likely than white hom eowners in New Orleans to own\nhomes with lower values, nor the 2008 PolicyLink study, which\ngroups all African-American homeowners in Orleans Parish\ntogether regardless of income level, allow for disparate impact\nanalysis as to non- LMI African-American homeowners in\nOrleans  Parish.  Plaint iffs’  anecdotal evidence, including\ncongressional  testimony,  does not fill the gap.  W ithout\ndisaggregated data, the showing regarding African-American\napplicants who are ineligible for ACGs is “too weak t o give\n[plaintiffs] the likelihood of success required for a preliminary\ninjunction.”  Maj. Op. at 3.\nThe court, as a result, need not address the other three\npreliminary injunction factors.  See Apotex, Inc. v. FDA, 449\nF.3d 1249, 1253-54 (D.C. Cir. 2006); Maj. Op. at 19.  It bears\nnoting, however, that the m ajority takes a strange turn in\ndisposing of these appeals.  In reaching Keegan’s evidentiary\nobjection, the majority meanders into disparate impact theory\n– without citation to authority, e.g., Maj. Op. at 14-15, 17 – and\ninto benchmark suppositions not briefed by the parties much\nless argued in the district court, id. at 17-18, and set up only to\nbe rejected without record evidence on either side of the new\nconstructs while ignoring support for plaintiffs’ evidentiary\nproffer,  id.  at 19.  The m ajority’s  statewide  analysis\nrequirement, id. at 14-15, suffers from  similar flaws and, as\nnoted, that argument by Keegan is not properly before the\ncourt.  Along the way, the majority even speculates that white\nrecipients might have disparate impact claims under a different,\nsize-of-grant benchmark.  Id. at 18.  One m ight well wonder\nwhat  purpose these m eanderings  have other than t o  posit\nhurdles for future disparate im pact claims.  Whatever their\n\n9\npurpose, the comments by the majority are unnecessary to the\nresolution of these appeals.  Because these issues were not\nargued  by the   parties  in their briefs (Keegan’s passing\nassertions bare of authority fail to conform to FED. R. APP. P.\n28(a)(9)(A)), and  the appeals are based on a  pre-discovery\nrecord inasmuch as Keegan refused to present statistical data on\nthe Road Home Program to challenge plaintiffs’ evidentiary\nproffer in the district court, rum inations regarding disparate\nimpact  analysis and alternative statistical benchm arks  are\nproperly left for another day.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT\nPlaintiffs’ claims against defendant, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment (“HUD”), should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction and for failure to state a\nclaim on which relief can be granted.  Plaintiffs, five home-owners and two non-profit fair\nhousing organizations, challenge HUD’s informal consultation, approval, and continuing\noversight of the State of Louisiana’s Road Home program, a program designed and administered\nby the Louisiana Recovery Authority (“LRA”) and funded by three special appropriations from\nCongress to provide federal disaster recovery assistance.  Plaintiffs claim that the state’s\ncompensation and incentives grants to homeowners whose homes were damaged or destroyed by\nHurricane Katrina impose a disparate impact on African Americans in violation of the Fair\nHousing Act (“FHA”), 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq., and the Housing and Community Development\nAct of 1974 (“HCDA”), 42 U.S.C. § 5301 et seq.  Plaintiffs claim that this discriminatory effect\narises from the fact that Louisiana has chosen to limit Road Home compensation and incentive\ngrant awards of up to $150,000 to the lesser of the cost of storm damage or the pre-storm value\nof the home.\nThis Court lacks jurisdiction because plaintiffs lack standing under Article III of the U.S.\nConstitution to maintain this action against HUD.  Plaintiffs have failed to allege, and cannot\nshow, that there is a substantial likelihood that the relief they seek from this Court against HUD\nwill redress their injuries even if awarded.  Neither the special appropriations that funded the\nRoad Home program, nor any other authority, placed any responsibility on HUD to design or\nimplement the challenged program.  Nor do the special appropriations or any other authority\nrequire Louisiana to provide any disaster recovery assistance to homeowners, let alone dictate\nhow the compensation and incentives grants should be calculated.  Thus, plaintiffs cannot show\nthat an order of this Court setting aside HUD’s approval of Louisiana’s Road Home program will\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 13 of 57\nprovide plaintiffs with Road Home grants awards that are based solely on the cost of storm\ndamage to a home, which is the relief that plaintiffs seek.  Accordingly, plaintiffs do not have\nstanding to maintain their claims against HUD. \nEven if plaintiffs had standing to maintain this action, this Court would lack jurisdiction\nwith respect to most of the funds at issue.  HUD obligated most of the disaster recovery funds to\nLouisiana, which, in turn, has drawn down those funds as it has implemented the program.  Thus,\nplaintiffs’ challenge to the LRA’s use of funds HUD has already obligated is moot.   \nIn addition, this Court lacks jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ claims against HUD because\nplaintiffs fail to even allege a waiver of sovereign immunity by the United States that\nencompasses their claims.  Plaintiffs’ invocation of this Court’s jurisdiction under general federal\njurisdiction and civil rights jurisdiction statutes do not provide a waiver of sovereign immunity. \nNor do the FHA or the HCDA, which plaintiffs allege HUD has violated, provide any waiver of\nimmunity by the United States.  Absent such a waiver, this Court lacks jurisdiction over\nplaintiffs’ claims against HUD.\nNor would the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq., provide a\nwaiver by the United States in this case even if plaintiffs asserted their claims under that statute. \nFirst, the APA would not provide a waiver because plaintiffs have an adequate remedy at law\ninasmuch as they can maintain these exact claims for injunctive relief directly against Louisiana\nstate officials under the FHA and the HCDA and directly against the State of Louisiana under\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d.  Second, the APA\nwould not provide a waiver for plaintiffs’ claims that HUD failed to affirmatively further fair\nhousing in violation of the FHA and the HCDA.  Neither statute requires HUD to take a discrete\naction that it failed to take in continuing to approve and oversee the Road Home program. \nAccordingly, the APA would not provide a waiver of sovereign immunity in this instance.\n-2-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 14 of 57\nFinally, even if this Court had jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ claims against HUD, plaintiffs\nhave failed to state a cause of action under the FHA and the HCDA.  Plaintiffs’ claim that the\nRoad Home grant awards impose a disparate impact on African Americans fails to allege that the\nprogram imposes a disparate impact on African Americans homeowners as compared to\nsimilarly-situated white homeowners.  Additionally, plaintiffs fail to make any allegations to\nsupport a claim that HUD violated its duty to affirmatively further fair housing.  Plaintiffs’\nallegations that the LRA proposed and developed the Road Home program in consultation with\nHUD, that HUD approved the Road Home program, and that the LRA administers the Road\nHome program subject to ongoing oversight and continuing approval of HUD, do not plead a\nviolation of HUD’s fair housing obligations.  Accordingly, plaintiffs fail to state a claim under\nwhich relief may be granted.\nII.  BACKGROUND\nA. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 and the Community\nDevelopment Block Grant Program\nThe Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (“HCDA” or “Act”), as\namended, 42 U.S.C. § 5301 et seq., seeks to develop viable urban communities by providing\ndecent housing, a suitable living environment, and expanding economic opportunities, principally\nfor persons of low and moderate income.  Id. § 5301(c).  The statute authorizes HUD to make\ngrants, known as Community Development Block Grants (“CDBG”) to states, tribes, and local\ngovernments to carry out activities in accordance with provisions of the Act, id. § 5303, and sets\nout 25 broad categories of activities for which grantees may use funds.  Id. §§ 5305, 5305(a). \nThe Act requires that not less than 70 percent of grant funds be used for the benefit of low- and\n-3-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 15 of 57\nmoderate-income persons.  Id. § 5301(c).1  Congress enacted the legislation as a federal block\ngrant statute, under which the day-to-day administration of the federal program, including the\nactual expenditure of federal funds, is delegated to state and local authorities.  Dixson v. U.S.,\n465 U.S. 482, 486 (1984).\nThe HCDA distributes funds appropriated by Congress through recipients outside the\nfederal government.  Id. at 486-87.  To that end, the statute provides for a straight-forward\napplication and approval process for federal assistance, see id. §§ 5301(b)(3), 5301(d)(1),\n5304(b), and shifts the responsibility from the federal government to state and local authorities\nfor the implementation of federally assisted projects.  Brandon v. Pierce, 725 F.2d 555, 559 (10th\nCir. 1984) (citing Conf. Rep. No. 1279, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., reprinted in 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n4449 et seq.,), overruled on other grounds by, Village of Los Ranchos De Albuquerque v. Marsh,\n956 F.2d 970 (10th Cir. 1992).  Accordingly, it is the grant recipients, rather than HUD, that\ndesign programs, within the federal constraints, to address local needs.  Dixson, 465 U.S. at 487. \nFurther, HUD’s role is confined to ensuring that the state’s interpretation of the statutory and\nregulatory requirements “are not plainly inconsistent with the Act,” 24 C.F.R. § 570.480(c)\n(giving “maximum feasible deference” to a state’s interpretation of these requirements), in order\nto avoid “unnecessary ‘second-guessing by Washington.’”  S. Rep. No. 93-693, 93d Cong., 2d\nSess. 56, reprinted in 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 4273, 4325.\nTo obtain federal funds, state or local authorities must develop a five-year consolidated\nplan that assesses housing and homeless needs, analyzes the jurisdiction’s housing markets, sets\nforth strategic plans for meeting priority needs, and sets out action plans.  Action plans, in turn,\nmust include required certifications that the applicants will comply with the requirements of the\n1  The statute defines low- and moderate- income persons as individuals whose incomes\ndo not exceed 80 percent of the median income of the area involved.  42 U.S.C.\n§ 5302(a)(20)(A).   \n-4-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 16 of 57\nprogram.  42 U.S.C. § 5304(a); id. § 12705; 24 C.F.R. § 570.485, id. Part 91, Subparts C & D.\nHUD’s regulations implementing the HCDA require grantees to certify that their\nprojected use of funds “will give maximum feasible priority to activities . . .[(i)] of benefit to\nlow- and moderate-income families, . . .[(ii) that seek] elimination of slums and blight, [or (iii)\nthat seek] to meet other community development needs having a particular urgency because\nexisting conditions pose a serious threat to health and welfare.”  24 C.F.R. § 570.483.  The\nregulations provide that an activity generally will be considered to meet the national objective of\nbenefit to low and moderate income persons if: (i) the activity benefits an area that is at least 51\npercent low and moderate income; (ii) the activity benefits a limited low- and moderate-income\nclientele, including services or facilities for the homeless, abused children, the elderly, or migrant\nfarm workers; (iii) the activity provides or improves permanent housing to be occupied by a low-\nor moderate-income person; or (iv) the activity is designed to create permanent jobs where at\nleast 51 percent of the jobs will be held by or made available to low- and moderate-income\npersons.

HUD has 45 days\nto review the plan, and the plan is deemed approved unless HUD notifies the jurisdiction within\nthe 45-day period that the plan is disapproved.  Id. § 91.500(a).  HUD may disapprove a plan\nonly if it is inconsistent with the purposes of the Act, it is substantially incomplete, the\ncertifications are not acceptable, or if HUD determines that the applicant has not complied with\nthe CDBG requirements.  Id. § 91.500(b).  The regulations do not permit HUD to disapprove an\napplication based on the grantee’s choice of eligible activities.  Id.; Kome Decl. ¶ 9.\nIn order to ensure that CDBG funds are not misused, the HCDA authorizes HUD to audit\nthe records of HCDA programs, 42 U.S.C. § 5304(e), and to recover improperly expended funds. \nId. § 5311(b)(2); Dixson, 465 U.S. at 487.

Pub. L. Nos. 109-148, 109-234, and 110-116\nIn response to the 2005 Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, Congress passed three\nspecial appropriations to provide disaster recovery CDBG funds to affected areas in five states,\nincluding Louisiana.  See Pub. L. No. 109-148, 119 Stat. 2779 (Dec. 30, 2005) (the “first\nappropriation”); Pub. L. No. 109-234, 120 Stat. 418 (June 15, 2006) (the “second\nappropriation”); and Pub. L. No. 110-116, 121 Stat. 1343 (Nov. 13, 2007) (the “third\nappropriation”).  The first appropriation provided $11,500,000,000 in CDBG funds to the\naffected states, which Congress directed to “be administered through an entity . . . designated by\n. . . each State.”  Pub. L. 109-148.  This appropriation required HUD to “waive, or specify\nalternative requirements for, any provision of any statute or regulation[, including the HCDA\nand its implementing regulations] that [HUD] administers in connection with the obligation by\n[HUD] or the use by the recipient of these funds or guarantees,” except for requirements related\nto fair housing, nondiscrimination, labor standards, and the environment, “upon a request by the\nState that such waiver is required to facilitate the use of such funds or guarantees, and a finding\nby the Secretary that such waiver would not be inconsistent with the overall purpose of the\nstatute, as modified.”  Id. (emphasis added).  The first appropriation also authorized HUD to\n“waive the requirement [of the HCDA] that activities benefit persons of low and moderate\nincome, except that at least 50 percent of the funds made available under this heading must\nbenefit primarily persons of low and moderate income unless [HUD] otherwise makes a finding\nof compelling need.”  Id. (emphasis added).  The appropriation required HUD to “publish in the\nFederal Register any waiver of any statute or regulation.”  Id.2   Finally, the appropriation\nrequired, prior to the obligation of these funds to each state, that the state submit a plan to HUD\n2  The appropriation also provided that it would not lapse.  Id.\n-7-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 19 of 57\n“detailing the proposed use of all funds, including criteria for eligibility and how the use of these\nfunds will address long-term recovery and restoration of infrastructure.”  Id.\nThe second appropriation provided an additional $5,200,000,000 in CDBG funds to the\naffected states and authorized (although it did not require) HUD to make these same statutory\nand regulatory waivers authorized by the first appropriation.  Pub. L. No. 109-234.  This\nappropriation earmarked $1,112,650,000 for affordable rental housing programs.  Id.; Kome\nDecl. ¶ 11.  The remainder of the second appropriation was substantially identical to the first. \nPub. L. No. 109-234; Kome Decl. ¶ 11.  The third appropriation provided an additional\n$3,000,000,000 “solely for the purpose of covering costs associated with otherwise\nuncompensated but eligible claims that were filed on or before July 31, 2007, under the Road\nHome program administered by the State [of Louisiana] in accordance with plans approved by\n[HUD].”  Pub. L. No. 110-116.      \nC. HUD Waivers of CDBG Program Requirements and Louisiana’s Action Plan\nfor CDBG Disaster Recovery Funds\nOn February 13, 2006, HUD published a Federal Register notice implementing the\nrequirements of the first appropriation.  71 Fed. Reg. 7666 (Feb. 13, 2006).  HUD allocated\n$6,210,000,000 of the first appropriation to Louisiana.  Id.  As directed by Congress in the first\nappropriation, HUD waived many standard certifications of the CDBG program, including the\nrequirement that 70 percent of funds be used for activities that benefit low- and moderate-income\npersons, in order “to give grantees even greater flexibility to carry out recovery activities within\nthe confines of the CDBG program national objectives.”  71 Fed. Reg. at 7667.  In their place,\nHUD substituted alternative certifications.  Id.  Pursuant to the first appropriation, HUD required\nthe states to certify that activities funded “be for necessary expenses related to disaster relief,\nlong-term recovery, and restoration of infrastructure in the most impacted and distressed areas\n-8-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 20 of 57\nrelated to the consequences of the hurricanes.”  Id. at 7670.  As also directed by the first\nappropriation, HUD required that, overall, at least 50 percent of disaster recovery grant funds be\nused for activities that principally benefit low- and moderate-income persons.  Id. at 7667; see\nalso id. at 7668.  As further directed by the first appropriation, HUD still required the state to\ncertify that it will affirmatively further fair housing, “which means that it will conduct an analysis\nto identify impediments to fair housing choice within the state, take appropriate actions to\novercome the effects of any impediments identified through that analysis, and maintain records\nreflecting the analysis and actions in this regard.”  Id. at 7671.  HUD did not waive the CDBG\nprogram’s financial accountability requirements.  Kome Decl. ¶ 13. \nLouisiana submitted its first action plan in early 2006 and made all required alternative\ncertifications at that time, including the certification that the state would affirmatively further fair\nhousing.  Kome Decl. ¶ 14.3  As is required by the CDBG program, the state already had\nproduced a pre-storm Analysis and Impediments (“AI”) to fair housing.  Id.  HUD advised\nLouisiana to review its AI post-storm and make any updates the state deemed necessary.  Id. \nD. Louisiana’s Road Home Program and HUD’s Role in Reviewing, Approving\nand Monitoring the Program\nOn May 12, 2006, Louisiana submitted Amendment 1 to its original action plan, known\nas the Road Home Program.  Kome Decl. ¶ 15.  The program consists of: (i) homeowner\ncompensation and incentives programs; (ii) workforce and affordable rental housing programs;\n(iii) homeless housing programs; and, (iv) developer incentive programs.  Id.  The Road Home\nprogram is administered by the State of Louisiana through the Louisiana Office of Community\nDevelopment and the Louisiana Recovery Authority, and is funded by HUD through the CDBG\nprogram.  Id.  The State of Louisiana is responsible for the implementation, design, and\n3  The state later made these same certifications in order to obtain funds from the second\nand third appropriations.  Kome Decl. ¶ 14.\n-9-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 21 of 57\nadministration of the Road Home program in conformance with the applicable CDBG program\nrequirements set by HUD.  Id.\n1. Technical Assistance Provided by HUD\nIn designing the Road Home homeowner compensation and incentives program,\nLouisiana requested, and HUD provided, some technical assistance.  Kome Decl. ¶ 16.  The state\nevaluated the relative costs of implementing a housing rehabilitation and reconstruction program\nas compared to implementing a homeowner compensation and incentives program.  Id.  State\nstaff called HUD staff several times a week throughout 2006 regarding the details of the\nhomeowner program design.  Id.  HUD’s guidance focused on how the activity could meet\nCDBG national objectives and how the state could manage the program to account for all\nprogram funds while meeting the disaster recovery purpose of the supplemental appropriations. \nId.  HUD did not make any of the state’s program decisions or set any funding strategies in the\nRoad Home Program.  Id.  Most of HUD’s technical assistance was provided by telephone.  Id.\nPart of the technical assistance HUD provided to state staff concerned sound financial\nmanagement principles.  Kome Decl.  ¶ 17.  Financial management principles guide the grantee\nin the design of a program that provides the smallest amount of resources necessary to achieve a\ndesired result.  Id.  HUD explained to state staff that, for example, the compensation and\nincentives program launched by the state of New York following September 11, 2001, provided\nno more than $14,500 to any household and achieved success in meeting its goals.  Id.  HUD also\nexplained that the city of Grand Forks, North Dakota, provided $5,000 loan payments as\nincentives to homeowners who remained in the city for disaster recovery after floods in 1997\ncaused significant damage to the city and its residences.  Id.\n-10-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 22 of 57\n2. Road Home homeowner compensation and incentives grant\nAs it developed the Road Home program, Louisiana ultimately chose to provide\ncompensation and incentives grants to eligible homeowners affected by Hurricanes Rita or\nKatrina of up to $150,000.  Kome Decl. ¶ 18.  Louisiana decided to base the amount of the\ncompensation and incentives grant on the lower of the pre-storm, fair-market value of the home,\nor the cost to repair the home.  Id.  The state chose to provide homeowners with three\ncompensation and incentive grant options: (i) stay in their home; (ii) purchase another home in\nLouisiana; or (iii) sell their home and choose not to remain a homeowner in the state.  See LRA\nhttp://www.road2la.org/homeowner/default.htm.4  The last day to apply to the Road Home\nprogram was July 31, 2007, and the last day to complete an initial appointment was December\n15, 2007.  Id.  \nIn developing the Road Home program, the state considered basing the compensation and\nincentives payment amounts on the tax valuations of homes.  Kome Decl. ¶ 19.  As part of the\ntechnical assistance HUD provided to the state, HUD stated its concern about using tax values as\npart of the basis for the calculation of the homeowner payment amount because the tax valuation\nsystem(s) in Louisiana, and in New Orleans Parish in particular, were unreliable, resulting in\nvastly different values for similar homes, with no rational basis.  Id.  The state ultimately chose\nnot to use tax values as a basis for providing compensation and incentives grants.  Id.\nTo determine the pre-storm value of a home, Louisiana chose to rely instead on pre-storm\n4  If the homeowner chooses to relocate within Louisiana, the compensation grant\ndepends on the extent of damage to the home.  Id.  If damage to the home is estimated at less\nthan 51% of the pre-storm value of the home, the compensation grant is the lesser of either (a)\nthe pre-storm value minus other assistance provided or (b) the estimated cost of damage minus\nother assistance.  Id.  If damage to the home is estimated at 51% or more of the pre-storm value\nof the home, the compensation grant is the pre-storm value minus other assistance provided.  Id. \nIf the homeowner chooses to relocate outside Louisiana, the compensation grant will be 60% of\nthe in-state relocation option, unless the homeowner is over age 65.  Id.  \n-11-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 23 of 57\nappraisals provided by the homeowner-applicants, the repositories of federal mortgage servicers,\nand the archives of Louisiana appraisal firms.  See\nhttp://www.road2la.org/homeowner/default.htm.  Louisiana also chose to allow homeowners to\nprovide a post-storm appraisal from a licensed and certified Louisiana appraiser setting out the\nproperty’s pre-storm value.  Id.\nAlthough the state chose to base the calculation of the payment it would make to each\nhomeowner on one of several measures of pre-storm property value or storm damage,\ncompensation and incentives under the Road Home program are not actually for storm damage. \nKome Decl. ¶ 20.   Rather, the Road Home program provides compensation and incentives for\nthe homeowner’s agreement to meet certain recovery conditions, such as remaining in a certain\ngeographic area, maintaining flood insurance on a dwelling, and meeting modern building codes\nwithin a set period of time.  Id.\n3. Additional Compensation Grants, Individual Mitigation Measures,\nand Elevation Allowances\nLouisiana also chose to provide Additional Compensation Grants of up to $50,000 for\ncertain homeowners.  Kome Decl. ¶ 21.  Louisiana provides the Additional Compensation Grants\nto bridge any gap between the estimated cost of damage and the amount(s) the homeowner\nreceives from other assistance (insurance, FEMA, etc.) and the basic compensation and\nincentives grant, still subject to the $150,000 limit on the grant.  See\nhttp://www.road2la.org/homeowner/default.htm.  Louisiana decided to offer Additional\nCompensation and incentives Grant to applicants with household incomes at or less than 80\npercent of the median income in the parish where the house was located.  Id.  In addition to the\nAdditional Compensation Grants, Louisiana chose to provide compensation and incentives grants\nto homeowners via Individual Mitigation Measures and Elevation Incentives.  Id.  Individual\n-12-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 24 of 57\nMitigation Measures provide incentive grants to homeowners to install home “hardening”\nfeatures that will protect homes from future storm damage, including storm shutters and roof tie\ndowns.  Id.  Elevation Incentives are grants to elevate site-built homes and mobile homes to meet\nFEMA’s current Advisory Base Flood Elevation or Base Flood Elevation levels to protect against\nfuture floods.  Id.\n4. HUD review and approval of the Road Home homeowner program\n  As part of the technical assistance HUD provided to Louisiana, HUD reviewed the Road\nHome program’s ability to help Louisiana meet the overall benefit requirements of the special\nappropriations.  Kome Decl. ¶ 22.  As noted above, the special appropriations’ overall benefit\nrequirement is that 50 percent of the state’s disaster recovery CDBG expenditures will support\nactivities that benefit low- and moderate-income persons.  Id.  To meet that requirement,\nLouisiana can count homeowner payments to low- and moderate-income households and rental\nprojects that house low- and moderate-income tenants toward the overall requirement, but it\ncannot count payments to above-income homeowners, or for above-income rental projects.  Id. \nHUD determined that Louisiana’s inclusion of the Additional Compensation Grant, Individual\nMitigation Measures, and Elevation Allowances could help the state meet the overall benefit\nrequirement.  Id.\n  On June 14, 2006, HUD published a Federal Register notice granting additional waivers\nto Louisiana and approving Louisiana’s Road Home program.  71 Fed. Reg. 34451 (June 14,\n2006).  Finding that additional waivers and alternative requirements are not inconsistent with the\noverall purpose of the HCDA, HUD waived statutory and regulatory requirements to allow\nLouisiana to provide compensation to homeowners whose homes were damaged, “if the\nhomeowners agree to meet the stipulations of the published program design.”  Id.  HUD also\nallowed Louisiana to “offer disaster recovery or mitigation housing incentives to promote\n-13-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 25 of 57\nhousing development or resettlement in particular geographic areas.”  Id. at 34453.5  In addition,\nHUD approved Louisiana’s use of disaster recovery CDBG funds for, among other things,\n(i) government buildings; (ii) special economic development job-retention activities; (iii) down\npayment assistance for new construction; (iv) support of the tourism industry; (v) relocation\nassistance; and (vi) the one-for-one replacement requirement of housing units damaged by\ndisaster.  Id. at 34452-53.  \nOn March 6, 2007, HUD provided additional waivers that allowed Louisiana to use\nCDBG disaster recovery funds for, among other things, (i) research, commercialization, and\neducational enhancement; (ii) operating subsidies for affordable rental housing; and (iii) rental\nand utility payment assistance.  72 Fed. Reg. 10014 (Mar. 6, 2007).  Kome Decl. ¶ 24.  \nTo date, HUD has obligated $12,400,000,000 to Louisiana to administer the Road Home\nprogram.  Kome Decl. ¶ 25.  As of February 22, 2009, Louisiana had provided approximately\n$7,800,000,000 in compensation and incentive grants to 140,083 homeowner applicants through\nthe Road Home homeowners program, for an average award of $63,517.  See\nhttp://www.road2la.org/default.htm.  In addition to its homeowner compensation and incentives\nprogram, Louisiana has devoted approximately $1,540,000,000 CDBG disaster recovery funds to\naffordable rental housing programs.  Kome Decl. ¶ 25.  Rental housing assistance programs\nfunded by the grants include the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (“LIHTC”) Piggyback\nProgram, Gulf Opportunity Zone (“GO Zone”) tax credits, public housing projects and developer\nincentives.  Id.  Louisiana also has devoted funds for homeless shelters and homelessness\ncessation services.  Id.  \n5  HUD also noted that, under the HCDA and implementing regulations, states “have the\ndiscretion to pay pre-flood or post-flood values for the acquisition of properties located in a flood\nway or floodplain.”  Id. at 34456.  HUD noted that “[i]n using CDBG disaster recovery funds for\nsuch acquisitions, the grantee must uniformly apply whichever valuation method it chooses.”  Id.\n-14-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 26 of 57\nE.

Plaintiffs assert jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1331, 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3)-(4), 42 U.S.C. § 3613, and seek declaratory and injunctive relief\nunder 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-02.  Compl. ¶¶ 8-9.  Plaintiffs consist of five homeowners, who allege\nthat they lived in New Orleans and that their homes were destroyed by Hurricane Katrina, and\ntwo non-profit fair housing organizations.  Id. ¶¶ 11-17.  Plaintiff homeowners allege that they\nreceived Road Home grant awards that were less than the cost of storm damage to their homes\nand that they have been unable to complete repairs on their homes.  Id. ¶¶ 61-65.  The\norganizational plaintiffs claim that, because of the Road Home program, they have been\n“substantially injured and frustrated in their mission to promote fair housing,” and “have been\nforced to devote scarce resources to identifying and counteracting defendants’ housing practices\n. . . [and] to educat[ing] the public about the . . . nature of the Road Home program.”  Id. ¶¶ 66-\n71.  The organizational plaintiffs also claim that they “would have devoted their resources to\ntheir other activities and services such as expanding equal housing opportunities; . . . providing\ncounseling and referral services to the public . . . ; and assisting residents . . . affected by [the]\n[h]urricanes, . . . to negotiate mortgage loan modifications and equitable insurance settlements.” \nId. ¶ 73.  The individual plaintiffs bring this action “on behalf of themselves and all similarly-\nsituated . . . African American homeowners in New Orleans who have participated in Louisiana’s\nRoad Home program or will participate by the first day of trial, whose grant amount was\ncalculated or will be calculated based on the pre-storm value of their homes, and who have\nselected or will select the program’s option of using funds to repair or rebuild their homes.”  Id.\n¶¶ 20-21.  \nPlaintiffs claim that the requirement that the Road Home grant awards not exceed the pre-\n-15-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 27 of 57\nstorm value of the home (where the pre-storm value is less than the cost of damage) has a\ndiscriminatory impact on African Americans.  Compl. ¶ 52.  Plaintiffs further allege that African\nAmerican recipients of Road Home grants are more likely than white grantees to have a gap in\ntheir rebuilding resources and the cost to rebuild.  Id. ¶¶ 56, 58.  The entirety of plaintiffs\nallegations against HUD are that: (i) the LRA “proposed and developed” the Road Home\nprogram, “in consultation with HUD,” (ii) HUD “approved the Road Home grant formula,” and\n(iii) the LRA administers the Road Home program “subject to ongoing oversight and continuing\napproval of HUD.”  Id. ¶¶ 49-51.  As a result of these alleged actions, plaintiffs allege that HUD\nhas: (i) made housing unavailable or denied housing to African American homeowners, in\nviolation of 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a); (ii) discriminated against African Americans in the availability,\nterms and conditions of real-estate related transactions, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 3605(a); and\n(iii) failed to administer housing programs in a manner that affirmatively furthers fair housing, in\nviolation of 42 U.S.C. § 3608(d), (e)(5).  Id. ¶¶ 74-76.  Plaintiffs also allege that HUD “failed to\nadminister the CDBG program in a manner that affirmatively furthers fair housing,” in violation\nof 42 U.S.C. § 5304(b)(2) (requiring “grantees” to affirmatively further fair housing).  Id. ¶ 77. \nPlaintiffs seek a declaration that HUD has deprived plaintiffs of their rights under the FHA and\nthe HCDA and seek an injunction that would require HUD to “cease violating plaintiffs’ rights”\nand to “recalculat[e] Road Home homeowners grants in a non-discriminatory manner.”  Compl.,\nRequest for Relief.\nIII. STANDARD OF REVIEW\nTo prevail on a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 12(b)(1), it is the plaintiffs’ burden to establish that the court has subject matter\njurisdiction to hear the case.  In re Swine Flu Immunization Prods. Liab. Litig., 880 F.2d 1439,\n1442-43 (D.C. Cir. 1989); Jones v. Exec. Ofc. of the Pres., 167 F. Supp. 2d 10, 13 (D.D.C. 2001). \n-16-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 28 of 57\nMoreover, “plaintiff[s’] factual allegations in the complaint . . . will bear closer scrutiny in\nresolving a 12(b)(1) motion than in resolving a 12(b)(6) motion for failure to state a claim”\nbecause the plaintiffs bear the burden of proof.  Grand Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police v.\nAshcroft, 185 F. Supp. 2d 9, 13-14 (D.D.C. 2001) (internal quotation marks omitted).  In making\nits determination regarding the existence of subject matter jurisdiction, the court may consider\nmatters outside the pleadings, such as a declaration submitted by an agency official.  Lipsman v.\nSec’y of the Army, 257 F. Supp. 2d 3, 6 (D.D.C. 2003).\nPlaintiffs’ standing under Article III of the U.S. Constitution to maintain this action in\nfederal court is a threshold jurisdictional matter that must be decided prior to other issues\ninvolved in the case.  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 500 (1975) (standing is a threshold inquiry\nthat “in no way depends on the merits of the plaintiff’s contention that particular conduct is\nillegal”); Am. Library Ass’n v. F.C.C., 401 F.3d 489, 492 (D.C. Cir. 2005).  The “irreducible\nconstitutional minimum of standing” requires that plaintiffs demonstrate (a) an “injury in fact”\nwhich is “concrete and particularized,” (b) that the injury is “fairly . . . trace[able] to the\nchallenged action of the defendant, and not . . . th[e] result [of] the independent action of some\nthird party,” and (c) that it is “‘likely,’ as opposed to merely ‘speculative,’ that the injury will be\n‘redressed by a favorable decision.’”  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-561\n(1992) (emphasis added) (quoting in part Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rts. Org., 426 U.S. 26, 38,\n41-42, 43 (1976)).  “This triad . . . constitutes the core of Article III’s case-or-controversy\nrequirement, and the party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing its\nexistence.”  Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 103-104 (1998).  Moreover,\nthese three core requirements of standing are substantially more difficult to establish where, as\nhere, plaintiffs are not themselves the direct object of the particular federal government action or\ninaction challenged in the lawsuit.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562.\n-17-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 29 of 57\n “The doctrine of mootness is a logical corollary of the case or controversy\nrequirement[.]”  Better Gov’t Ass’n v. Dep’t of State, 780 F.2d 86, 90 (D.C. Cir. 1986).  In cases\nwhere challenged conduct ceases, “it becomes impossible for the court to grant any effectual\nrelief whatever to the prevailing party, and any opinion as to the legality of the challenged action\nwould be advisory.” City of Erie v. Pap’s A.M., 529 U.S. 277, 287 (2000).  Accordingly, a court\nmay not rule on the merits of a case in which the claim for relief is moot.\nAbsent an express statutory waiver, the doctrine of sovereign immunity shields the\nfederal government from suit.  FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 475 (1994); see also U.S. v.\nSherwood, 312 U.S. 584, 586 (1941).  Because sovereign immunity is jurisdictional in nature,\nMeyer, 510 U.S. at 475, “the terms of [the government’s] consent to be sued in any court define\nthat court’s jurisdiction to entertain the suit.”  Sherwood, 312 U.S. at 586.  As the Supreme Court\nhas often observed, a waiver of sovereign immunity must be “unequivocally expressed in the\nstatutory text” and “strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign.”  Dep’t of\nArmy v. Blue Fox, Inc., 525 U.S. 255, 261 (1999) (internal quotations omitted).  A party bringing\nsuit against the United States bears the burden of proving that the government has unequivocally\nwaived its immunity.  See, e.g., Graham v. Fed. Emergency Mgt. Agency, 149 F.3d 997, 1005\n(9th Cir. 1998); James v. U.S., 970 F.2d 750, 753 (10th Cir. 1992); Reynolds v. Army & Air\nForce Exch. Serv., 846 F.2d 746, 748 (Fed. Cir. 1988).\nAlthough plaintiffs have not invoked the Court’s jurisdiction under the Administrative\nProcedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq., the APA provides, in certain circumstances, a\nlimited waiver of sovereign immunity for suits seeking non-monetary relief against the United\nStates and its agencies.  5 U.S.C. § 702.  Under the APA, however, a court may overturn agency\naction, or compel agency inaction, only if the action or inaction was “arbitrary, capricious, an\nabuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,” or in excess of its statutory\n-18-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 30 of 57\njurisdiction or authority.  5 U.S.C. § 706(1), (2)(A), (C).  The question of whether an agency has\nproperly exercised its discretion does not “rais[e] issues of fact,” but “primarily raise[s] issues of\nlaw.”  James Madison Ltd. v. Ludwig, 82 F.3d 1085, 1096 (D.C. Cir. 1996). \nFurther, when a court has jurisdiction to review an agency action under the APA, it sits as\nan appellate tribunal—its only function is to determine whether the agency committed legal error,\nnot to supervise future regulatory action by the agency.  Heckler v. Redbud Hosp. Dist., 473 U.S.\n1308, 1313 (1985).  Thus, in the event the Court were to find jurisdiction and rule in favor of\nplaintiffs, the Court would be empowered only to set aside the agency’s action, or order the\nagency to act, and leave it to the agency to take appropriate further action; the Court would not be\nempowered to compel specific remedial or affirmative action, or prohibit other future action by\nthe agency.  County of Los Angeles v. Shalala, 192 F.3d 1005, 1011 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (“[W]hen a\ncourt reviewing agency action determines that an agency made an error of law, the court’s inquiry\nis at an end: the case must be remanded to the agency for further action consistent with the\ncorrected legal standards.”) (quoting PPG Indus., Inc. v. U.S., 52 F.3d 363, 365 (D.C. Cir.\n1995)); id. at 1011–12 (holding that the district court erred in retaining jurisdiction to devise a\nspecific remedy for the agency to follow).\nIV. ARGUMENT\nA.   Plaintiffs Lack Standing to Maintain Their Claims Against HUD\nBecause They Cannot Satisfy the Redress Prong of Article III’s \nStanding Requirement\nPlaintiffs lack standing to challenge HUD’s actions because they cannot establish that the\njudgment they seek would redress the injuries they have identified.  “Redressability examines\nwhether the relief sought, assuming that the court chooses to grant it, will likely alleviate the\nparticularized injury alleged by the plaintiff.”  Fla. Audubon Soc’y v. Bentsen, 94 F.3d 658,\n-19-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 31 of 57\n663-64 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (en banc).6  In this action, plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that\nHUD’s “acts, practices, policies, and omissions have deprived [p]laintiffs of their rights under\nthe [FHA] and the [HCDA],” and seek injunctive relief ordering HUD “to cease immediately\n[its] violation of [p]laintiffs’ rights.”  Compl., Request for Relief ¶¶ (b) - (c).  Plaintiffs also seek\nan injunction “recalculating Road Home homeowner grants in a nondiscriminatory manner.”  Id.\n¶ (c).  To satisfy the redressability component of standing, plaintiffs would have to allege (and\nultimately prove) that it is “likely,” as opposed to merely “speculative,” Friends of the Earth, Inc.\nv. Laidlaw Env’tl Srvs., Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 181 (2000)), that a judgment setting aside HUD’s\napproval of Louisiana’s Road Home program, and finding HUD’s continuing approval and\noversight was arbitrary and capricious, would redress their injuries.  See Compl., Prayer for\nRelief.  This plaintiffs cannot do. \nAn “adequate examination” of redressability requires that the court first “identify the\ncomponents of [plaintiffs’] alleged harm.”  Freedom Republicans, Inc. v. FEC, 13 F.3d 412, 416\n(D.C. Cir. 1994).  Here, plaintiffs identify as a harm to them only that Louisiana’s “Road Home\ngrant awards are calculated using the lower of two baseline values: the pre-storm value of the\nhome, or the cost of damage to the home,” Compl. ¶ 47, which in turn, allegedly has a disparate\nimpact on African Americans.  Id. ¶  52.  Plaintiffs’ complaint is not that HUD directly imposed\nthese requirements.  See id. ¶ 49 (alleging that the LRA proposed and developed the Road Home\n6  The D.C. Circuit has explained that when, as is true in this case, “plaintiffs’ claim\nhinges on the failure of [the federal] government to prevent another party’s injurious behavior,\nthe “fairly traceable” and redressability inquiries appear to merge.  See Competitive Enter. Inst. v.\nNHTSA, 901 F.2d 107, 113 (D.C. Cir. 1990).  In such cases, both prongs of the standing analysis\ncan be said to focus on principles of causation:  fair traceability turns on the causal nexus\nbetween the agency action and the asserted injury, while redressability centers on the causal\nconnection between the asserted injury and judicial relief.  See Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 753\nn.19 (1984).  Despite these similarities, however, each inquiry has its own emphasis.  Causation\nremains inherently historical; redressability quintessentially predictive.  See id.\n-20-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 32 of 57\nProgram); id. ¶ 51 (alleging that the LRA administers the Road Home Program).  Instead, they\nallege only that HUD’s initial and continuing approval and oversight of the Road Home grant\nformula, id. at ¶¶ 50-51, is allegedly the cause of their injuries.  \nHowever, “indirectness of injury, while not necessarily fatal to standing, ‘may make it\nsubstantially more difficult to meet the minimum requirement of Art. III: To establish that, in\nfact, the asserted injury was the consequence of the defendants’ actions, or that prospective relief\nwill remove the harm.”’ Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. at 44-45 (emphasis\nadded) (quoting in part Warth, 422 U.S. at 505).  As the Supreme Court explained in Lujan v.\nDefenders of Wildlife: \nWhen . . . a plaintiff’s asserted injury arises from the government’s allegedly\nunlawful regulation (or lack of regulation) of someone else, much more is needed. \nIn that circumstance, causation and redressability ordinarily hinge on the response\nof the regulated (or regulable) third party to the government action or inaction\n. . . .  The existence of one or more of the essential elements of standing depends\non the unfettered choices made by independent actors . . . whose exercise of broad\nand legitimate discretion the courts cannot presume to control or to predict. \n504 U.S. at 562 (emphasis by court) (quotation and citation omitted).\nThus, to satisfy the minimum requirements of Article III, plaintiffs must demonstrate that\nit is “likely,” and not merely “speculative,” that the prospective relief they seek (invalidation of\nHUD’s approval of Louisiana’s Road Home grant formula, see Compl., Prayer for Relief) will\nresult in the removal of the harm they have identified (Road Home grants . . . calculated based on\nthe pre-storm value of the home), Compl. ¶ 60).  If plaintiffs are unable to do so, then their\ninjuries would not be redressed by a favorable judgment and their claims must be dismissed for\nlack of standing.  Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 107 (“Relief that does not remedy the injury suffered\ncannot bootstrap a plaintiff into federal court; that is the very essence of the redressability\nrequirement.”).\nHere, plaintiffs have not and cannot demonstrate a likelihood that a favorable judgment in\n-21-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 33 of 57\nthis action against HUD would have any substantial impact on decisions by LRA regarding how\nto use disaster recovery CDBG funds provided by the special appropriations.  Consequently, even\nif this Court were to declare HUD’s approval of Louisiana’s Road Home grant awards to be\ninvalid, and HUD’s continuing oversight of the program to be arbitrary and capricious, plaintiffs\nhave not even alleged, and cannot establish a likelihood, that the LRA would necessarily create a\ndisaster recovery program that provided something resembling the repair cost reimbursement\nstructure that plaintiffs seek.  To be clear, plaintiffs challenge is to HUD’s approval and\ncontinuing oversight of third-party conduct – Louisiana’s decision about how to use disaster\nrecovery funds under the special appropriations.  Under these circumstances, invalidation of\nHUD’s approval of the Road Home grant awards and finding its oversight arbitrary and\ncapricious would not necessarily alter Louisiana’s use of disaster recovery funds in a way that\nfavors plaintiffs. \nEven assuming arguendo that “the Road Home formula design disproportionately\nburdens African American homeowners and hinders their ability to return home compared to\nwhite families,” as plaintiffs allege, Compl. ¶ 58, both the CDBG program in general, and the\nspecial appropriations in particular, vest Louisiana, and not HUD, with the authority to decide\nhow to use these disaster recovery funds consistent with the requirements of the CDBG program\nas modified by the special appropriations.  Kome Decl. ¶¶ 3, 6, 9.  Courts have recognized\nHUD’s limited role in approving CDBG funds.  See, e.g., Mejia v. HUD, 688 F.2d 529, 535 (7th\nCir. 1982) (noting HUD’s limited power to review applications for CDBG funds).  In this case,\nmoreover, the special appropriations required HUD to waive its normal statutory and regulatory\nprogram requirements of the HCDA at the request of the states and on HUD’s finding that such\nwaiver would not be inconsistent with the purposes of the Act.  Kome Decl. ¶ 13.  Pub. L. 109-\n148 provided that HUD “shall waive, or specify alternative requirements for, any provision of\n-22-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 34 of 57\nany statute or regulation that [HUD] administers in connection with the obligation by [HUD] or\nthe use by the recipient of these funds or guarantees,” except for requirements related to fair\nhousing, nondiscrimination, labor standards, and the environment.  Id. (emphasis added).  Pub. L.\n109-234 also authorized HUD to waive these same requirements, see id., which HUD waived\n(and the waiver of which plaintiffs do not challenge).  Compl. passim.  See Kome Decl. ¶ 23. \nMoreover, the special appropriations cannot be reasonably read to preclude Louisiana from using\nthe pre-storm value of the house as a basis for providing disaster relief.   Pub. L. 109-148; Pub.\nL. 109-234.  Nor, if the Court were to set aside HUD’s approval of Louisiana’s homeowner\nprogram, or find its oversight to be arbitrary and capricious, would there be anything in the\nspecial appropriations that requires the State to provide compensation and incentive grants of up\nto $150,000, see id., which plaintiffs allege is necessary to allow them to complete repairs and\nreturn to their homes.  Compl. ¶¶ 60-65.  By contrast, New York’s use of CDBG disaster\nrecovery funds for a homeowner compensation program following September 11, 2001 provided\nno more than $14,500 to any household and achieved success in meeting its goals.  Kome Decl.\n¶ 17.  Similarly, the city of Grand Forks, North Dakota, used CDBG disaster recovery funds to\nprovide $5,000 loan payments as incentives to homeowners who remained in the city after\nflooding.  See id.  Neither of these programs was designed to provide compensation for the cost\nof damage to a home, yet both satisfied the requirement of HUD’s disaster recovery CDBG\nprogram.  Indeed, there is nothing in these specially-appropriated disaster relief authorizations\nthat would require Louisiana to provide any assistance to homeowners of any income level at all. \nPub. L. 109-148; Pub. L. 109-234.7  Rather, Louisiana had to obtain a waiver from HUD of the\n7  Of the $5,200,000,000 provided in the second appropriation, Congress required the five\nstates affected by the hurricanes to collectively devote at least $1,000,000,000 for the “repair,\nrehabilitation, and reconstruction (including demolition, site clearance and remediation) of the\naffordable rental housing stock (including public and other HUD-assisted housing) in the\n-23-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 35 of 57\nnormal CDBG program requirements just to allow the state to provide compensation and\nincentive grants to homeowners in the first place.  Kome Decl. ¶ 23.  In sum, in light of the\ndiscretion that the CDBG program and the special appropriations vest with Louisiana, plaintiffs\ncannot establish that an injunction against HUD would force Louisiana to provide them with the\nrelief they seek.  \nMoreover, plaintiffs’ speculation regarding what Louisiana “might” do if HUD’s\napproval or oversight are enjoined is exactly the type of speculation the courts have held\ninsufficient to establish standing.  See Compl. ¶ 60 (“Road Home grants could be calculated\nbased [solely] on the cost of damage to the home.”) (emphasis added).  For example, in Allen v.\nWright, the Supreme Court held that it was overly speculative whether requiring the IRS to\nenforce its rules, which prohibited tax breaks to racially discriminatory private schools, would\nprevent segregated schools, as plaintiff in that case alleged.  Allen, 468 U.S. at 751.  The Court\nheld that even the court-ordered withdrawal of tax breaks would not necessarily convince these\nprivate schools to change policies, or convince parents to transfer their children to nonsegregated\nschools.  Id. at 758.  Similarly, in Simon, the Court held that it was overly speculative to conclude\nthat suspending tax benefits to private hospitals would force those hospitals to take on more\nindigent patients, as plaintiff in that case had sought.  See Simon, 426 U.S. at 43-44 (1976).  See\nalso Linda R.S. v. Richard D., 410 U.S. 614, 618 (1973) (finding no standing based on lack of\nredressability because the prospect that prosecuting deadbeat dads would result in payment of\nchild support was only speculative).\nThe D.C. Circuit has also dismissed claims like plaintiffs’ for lack of standing on\nimpacted areas.”  Pub. L. 148-109 (emphasis added).  Congress made no such requirement that\nany funds be used for homeowners in any of the appropriations.  See, e.g., id.\nEven the third special appropriation merely provided funds to the Road Home program. \nPub. L. No. 110–116.  It did not require that these funds be used to assist homeowners.  See id.\n-24-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 36 of 57\nredressability grounds because the remedy sought was purely speculative.  In Freedom\nRepublicans, supra, the court of appeals dismissed for lack of standing a challenge to the Federal\nElection Commission’s alleged failure to enforce Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 against\nthe Republican Party and its delegate allocation system.  See Freedom Republicans, 13 F.3d at\n417.  The court held that the plaintiffs had not established that a possible judicial response would\nredress their injuries because it would have been “pure speculation” to attempt to predict the\npotential impact of the threat of withdrawal of all federal funding (which according to the\ncomplaint was in excess of $10,000,000) on the Republican Party’s decision-making.  See id. at\n418-19 & n.6.\nSimilarly, in US Ecology, Inc., v. U.S. Dep’t of the Interior, a private company sued the\nU.S. Department of Interior for its allegedly unlawful rescission of a decision to approve the\ntransfer of a plot of land to the State of California, which would enable the company to develop a\nfacility on the site as a licensee for the state.  The D.C. Circuit held that the injury of the private\ncompany was not redressable by a favorable court decision because the company could not\ndemonstrate that the state would accept title to the land from the federal government, let alone\nthat it would proceed with the plaintiff’s development contract.  See US Ecology, Inc. v. U.S.\nDep’t of the Interior, 231 F.3d 20, 21, 24-25 (D.C. Cir. 2000).\n  Finally, in Univ. Med. Ctr. of S. Nev. v. Shalala, 173 F.3d 438 (D.C. Cir. 1999), a hospital\nchallenged its allegedly unlawful exclusion by the Secretary of Health and Human Services from\na list of entities eligible for discounts from drug manufacturers.  The D.C. Circuit held that the\nplaintiff’s injury in losing drug discounts was not redressable by a favorable court decision\nwhere, even if the court granted declaratory relief that the government unlawfully delayed in\nplacing the hospital on the list of entities eligible for discounts, retroactive discounts would\nactually be available only if third party manufacturers could be persuaded to pay them.  See Univ.\n-25-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 37 of 57\nMed. Ctr. of S. Nev., 173 F.3d at 441.8   \n In each of these cases, the plaintiffs had not established, nor could the courts predict,\nhow non-federal parties would respond to a favorable decision for the plaintiffs, and thus\nplaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the requested relief against the federal defendants would\nredress plaintiffs’ injuries.  This fatal flaw is also present in this action because neither plaintiffs\nnor the Court can predict what effect, if any, a favorable court ruling in this case setting aside\nHUD’s approval of the Road Home program, or ordering HUD to exercise its oversight authority\nover the program, would have on decisions by Louisiana about whether to even continue the\nprogram or how to administer the program, let alone on the state’s decisions regarding how to\n8  Other circuits have dismissed similar challenges.  For example, in Rubin v. City of\nSanta Monica, 308 F.3d 1008 (9th Cir. 2002), the Ninth Circuit dismissed for lack of standing a\nchallenge to the California Secretary of State’s administration of the state’s election regulations\nbecause of the City of Santa Monica’s interpretation of those regulations.  The Ninth Circuit held\nthat plaintiff could not establish that “enjoining the Secretary of State from enforcing the election\nregulations would stop the City of Santa Monica from following them in the future.”  Id.  In so\nholding, the Ninth Circuit found that a “purely speculative” favorable outcome will not suffice to\nestablish the redressability prong.  Id. at 1020.   \nSimilarly, in Burton v. Cent. Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact Comm’n,\n23 F.3d 208 (8th Cir. 1994), the court addressed claims by plaintiffs seeking an injunction\nagainst a government’s taxation of public power entities.  Id. 209-10.  In holding that plaintiffs\nlacked standing, the Eighth Circuit held that, even though plaintiffs might by able to establish the\ntraceability prong of standing, by showing that “LES [a third party] increased electricity rates in\nresponse to the [defendant’s] taxes on LLRW [another third party],” it was still “not by itself\nenough to confer standing on [plaintiffs].”  Id. (emphasis added)  The Court explained that: \n[although increased rates may constitute an injury that is traceable to the\n[defendant’s] conduct, [plaintiff has] not alleged that the injury is likely to be\nredressed by a favorable decision.  The complaint asks the court to ‘redress\n[plaintiff’s] injuries’ by declaring the [defendant’s] policies illegal and issuing an\ninjunction preventing the [defendant] ‘from any further and future perversion of\nits legal duties.’  [Plaintiff] apparently would have us take it on faith that LES, . . .\nwould adjust its rates if the district court enjoined the [defendant’s] taxes on\nLLRW . . . Thus, it is “merely speculative” here whether a favorable decision\nwould affect the electricity rate that [plaintiff] pays.  \nId. at 210 (emphasis in original).  \n-26-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 38 of 57\nuse disaster recovery funds provided by the special appropriations.9  Certainly a favorable\njudgment of this Court would not make it likely that Louisiana would provide compensation and\nincentive grants of up to $150,000 based solely on the cost of damage to a home, as plaintiffs\nseek.\n  In sum, the judgment sought by plaintiffs against HUD in this case would not and could\nnot likely redress plaintiffs’ injuries caused by Louisiana.  Accordingly, plaintiffs lack standing\nto pursue their claims against HUD, and this action should be dismissed against HUD for lack of\nsubject matter jurisdiction.\nB. Plaintiffs’ Claims About HUD’s Approval and Oversight of the LRA’s Road\nHome Program are Mostly Moot\nPlaintiffs challenge HUD’s “approval” and “continuing approval and oversight” of the\nLRA’s Road Home program.  Compl. ¶¶ 50-51.  Because HUD has already obligated\n$12,400,000,000 in disaster recovery CDBG funds provided by the special appropriations to\nLouisiana to implement the Road Home program, plaintiffs’ challenge to HUD’s approval and\ncontinuing oversight of Louisiana’s use of these funds is now moot.  The D.C. Circuit’s case law\n“unequivocally provides that once the relevant funds have been obligated, a court cannot reach\nthem in order to award relief.”  City of Houston, Tex. v. HUD, 24 F.3d 1421, 1426 (D.C. Cir.\n1994).  In W. Va. Health Ctr. v. Heckler, 734 F.2d 1570 (D.C. Cir. 1984), for example, the court\n9  To be clear, plaintiffs’ claims here are plainly distinguishable from a challenge to a\ngovernment action which authorizes or permits “third party conduct that allegedly caused a\nplaintiff injury, when that conduct would otherwise have been illegal.”  E.g., Animal Legal\nDefense Fund v. Glickman, 154 F.3d 426, 442 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (en banc)  (emphasis added);\nAm.’s Community Bankers v. FDIC, 200 F.3d 822, 827 (D.C. Cir. 2000); Bristol-Myers Squibb\nCo. v. Shalala, 91 F.3d 1493, 1499 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  In that type of case, invalidation of the\nfederal government’s action would redress a plaintiff’s injury by rendering the third party’s\nconduct illegal again.  In this case, plaintiffs do not allege that HUD’s approval is what legalized\nthe LRA’s ability to provide “Road Home grants [that] are calculated using the lower of two\nbaseline values: the pre-storm value of the home or the court of damage to the home.”  Compl.\n¶ 47.  HUD merely provided the funding for the program.  \n-27-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 39 of 57\nacknowledged the equitable doctrine permitting courts to award funds after an appropriation has\nlapsed, if a suit is timely filed (as that case was), but held that no relief was available for one of\nthe fiscal years in question because “all of these funds ha[d] been awarded by the Secretary to\nvarious recipients.”  734 F.2d at 1577.  The D.C. Circuit has relied on similar reasoning in at\nleast two other cases.  See Ambach v. Bell, 686 F.2d 974, 986 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (“Once the\nchapter 1 funds are distributed to the States and obligated, they cannot be recouped.  It will be\nimpossible in the absence of a preliminary injunction to award the plaintiffs the relief they\nrequest if they should eventually prevail on the merits.”); Population Inst. v. McPherson, 797\nF.2d 1062, 1081 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (quoting Ambach and W. Va. Health Ctr., and noting that “if\nthe government in the instant case is permitted to distribute the $10 million to other\norganizations, the appeal will become moot.”).  Thus, to avoid having its case mooted, a plaintiff\nmust seek a preliminary injunction preventing the agency from disbursing those funds.  City of\nHouston, Tex. v. HUD, 24 F.3d at 1427.\nIn City of Houston, the court held that the case was moot on two independent grounds,\nincluding the fact that HUD had contractually obligated the CDBG funds at issue more than six\nmonths before plaintiff filed its complaint.  Id.10  In this case, HUD had already obligated\n$12,400,000,000 in disaster recovery CDBG funds to Louisiana provided by each of the special\nappropriations before plaintiffs brought suit.  Kome Decl. ¶ 25.  Accordingly, plaintiffs’ claims\nagainst HUD for its approval and continuing oversight of the LRA’s use of these funds for its\nRoad Home homeowners program are now moot.11  \n10  The other independent ground was that the appropriation had lapsed.

L. 109-148.  \n11  To be clear, HUD does not take the position that plaintiffs’ challenge to HUD’s\ncontinuing approval and oversight concerning funds not yet obligated, Kome Decl. ¶ 25, is moot.  \n-28-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 40 of 57\nC. Plaintiffs Fail to Allege a Waiver of Sovereign Immunity By the United States\nEven if plaintiffs’ lack of standing and the mootness of most of their claims were not a\nbar to this action against HUD, sovereign immunity is also a bar plaintiffs’ action against HUD. \n“The United States, as sovereign, is immune from suit save as it consents to be sued and the\nterms of its consent to be sued in any court define that court’s jurisdiction to entertain the suit.” \nHercules Inc. v. U.S., 516 U.S. 417, 422 (1996) (citations and internal punctuation omitted).  A\nwaiver of sovereign immunity “cannot be implied but must be unequivocally expressed” in the\ntext of the statute on which the claimed waiver is based.  U.S. v. King, 395 U.S. 1, 4 (1969). \nTherefore, in analyzing whether Congress has waived the immunity of the United States, waivers\nmust be construed strictly in favor of the sovereign, and not enlarged beyond what the statutory\nlanguage requires.  McMahon v. U.S., 342 U.S. 25, 27 (1951).  See also Ruckelshaus v. Sierra\nClub, 463 U.S. 680, 685-86 (1983); E. Transp. Co. v. U.S., 272 U.S. 675, 686 (1927). \nAccordingly, plaintiffs may not maintain any claims against HUD absent a waiver of sovereign\nimmunity that covers those claims, and plaintiffs are bound by any limitations, substantive or\nprocedural, that any such waiver imposes.  Veldheon v. U.S. Coast Guard, 35 F.3d 222, 225 (5th\nCir. 1994) (“Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.  Absent jurisdiction conferred by\nstatute, district courts lack power to consider claims.  This limitation is doubly significant for\nsuits against the federal government, which, absent express waiver, are barred by the doctrine of\nsovereign immunity.”).\nPlaintiffs invoke this Court’s jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331, 28 U.S.C.\n§§ 1343(a)(3)-(4), and 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201, 2202.

Although many of these statues may provide the Court with jurisdiction in appropriate\ncircumstances, none of them waives the sovereign immunity of the United States, and thus none\nprovides this Court with jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ claims against HUD.  \nFederal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 does not by itself operate as a\nwaiver of sovereign immunity by the United States.  See Sabhari v. Reno, 197 F.3d 938, 943 (8th\nCir. 1999); Lonsdale v. U.S., 919 F.2d 1440, 1443-44 (10th Cir. 1990); Kester v. Campbell, 652\nF.2d 13, 15 (9th Cir. 1981).  Moreover, federal courts have repeatedly and uniformly held that\n§ 1343(a) does not constitute a waiver of the United States’ sovereign immunity.  See, e.g.,\nSalazar v. Heckler, 787 F.2d 527, 528 (10th Cir. 1986); Beale v. Blount, 461 F.2d 1133, 1138\n(5th Cir. 1972); Zhu v. U.S., 2005 WL 1378914, *3 (D.D.C. 2005); Byrd v. Smith, 693 F.

In addition, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-02 allows for declaratory\njudgments; it does not confer jurisdiction, nor does it contain a waiver of sovereign immunity by\nthe United States.  Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 339 U.S. 667, 671 (1950); TTEA v.\nYsleta del Sur Pueblo, 181 F.3d 676, 681 (5th Cir. 1999); Amalgamated Sugar Co. v. Bergland,\n664 F.2d 818, 822 (10th Cir. 1981); Ballistrieri v. U.S., 303 F.2d 617, 619 (7th Cir. 1962).\nNor is there any express waiver of the United States’ sovereign immunity in the Fair\nHousing Act or the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974.  “[T]he Fair Housing\nAct does not waive sovereign immunity to permit suits against the federal government.”  Zhu v.\nGonzales, 2006 WL 1274767, *5 (D.D.C. May 8, 2006); Boyd v. Browner, 897 F. Supp. 590, 595\n(D.D.C.1995) (“[T]he Fair Housing Act does not ‘unambiguously waive’ the government’s\nsovereign immunity defense.”).  Accord Anderson v.

Lastly, the Housing and\nCommunity Development Act of 1974 does not waive the federal government’s immunity from\nsuit.  Pleune v. Pierce, 697 F. Supp. 113, 119 (E.D.N.Y. 1988); Nabke v. HUD, 520 F. Supp. 5,\n8-9 (W.D. Mich. 1981).  \nIn light of plaintiffs’ failure to even allege a waiver of sovereign immunity by the United\nStates, HUD remains immune from suit, and this Court lacks jurisdiction over HUD.  \nAccordingly, plaintiffs’ claims against HUD should be dismissed on sovereign immunity\ngrounds.\nD.  Plaintiffs Could Not Maintain Suit Under the Administrative Procedure Act,\nWhich Provides the Only Possible Waiver of Sovereign Immunity For Their\nClaims \nThe only sovereign immunity waiver that could conceivably apply to plaintiffs’ claims\nappears in the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”).  5 U.S.C. §§ 701 et seq.  The APA\nprovides a limited waiver of sovereign immunity for “[a] person suffering legal wrong because of\nagency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a\nrelevant statute.”  Id. § 702.12  However, in 5 U.S.C. § 704, “the APA excludes from its waiver of\nsovereign immunity claims for which an adequate remedy is available elsewhere.”  Fornaro v.\nJames, 416 F.3d 63, 66 (D.C. Cir. 2005).  See also Turner v. Sec’y of HUD, 449 F.3d 536, 539-\n41 (3d Cir. 2006) (an APA action that might otherwise be properly brought against HUD is\nbarred because plaintiffs can obtain their remedy against a non-federal party).  The statute also\nprecludes review when the underlying statute does not require the agency to take a discrete action\nwhich it failed to take.  Norton v. S. Utah Wilderness Alliance (“SUWA”), 542 U.S. 55, 64\n(2004).  \n12   The APA does not waive sovereign immunity for suits seeking monetary damages.\nDep’t of the Army v. Blue Fox, Inc., 525 U.S. 255, 260-63 (1999). \n-31-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 43 of 57\nIn this case, even if plaintiffs were to allege a waiver of immunity under the APA, judicial\nreview of the claims asserted would still be precluded because plaintiffs: (i) have an adequate\nremedy at law directly against Louisiana state officials and the State of Louisiana; and (ii) have\nfailed to identify specific, discrete actions that the relevant statutes required HUD to take.  \n1.  The APA would not waive sovereign immunity for plaintiffs’ claims\nbecause there is another adequate remedy at law\nSuit against federal agencies can be maintained under the APA only if there is a “final\nagency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.”  5 U.S.C. § 704.  See also\nTransohio Sav. Bank v. Dir., Ofc. of Thrift Supervision, 967 F.2d 598, 607 (D.C. Cir. 1992)\n(“Whether § 702 of the APA justifies . . . jurisdiction over [plaintiffs’] case depends on whether\n[their] claims fall under any of the . . . limitations on the APA’s waiver of sovereign immunity. \nThe APA excludes from its waiver . . . claims for which an adequate remedy is available\nelsewhere.”).  Here, such an adequate remedy exists because plaintiffs can maintain their\ndiscrimination claims — to the extent that any of them are cognizable — directly against the\nLouisiana state officials under the FHA and the HCDA, and directly against the State of\nLouisiana under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, alleging the same\nfacts and seeking the same remedies.  \n  Plaintiffs can maintain their claims for declaratory and injunctive relief under the FHA\nand the HCDA directly against defendant Paul Rainwater, as Executive Director of the LRA,\nunder the doctrine of Ex Parte Young.  See Verizon Md., Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Com’n of Md., 535\nU.S. 635, 646 (2002) (“In determining whether the doctrine of Ex parte Young avoids an\nEleventh Amendment bar to suit, a court need only conduct a straightforward inquiry into\nwhether [the] complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly\ncharacterized as prospective.”) (quotation marks and citation omitted).  Neither the FHA nor the\n-32-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 44 of 57\nHCDA display any intent to foreclose jurisdiction under Ex parte Young.  Accord High Plains\nCmty. Devel. Corp. v. Schaefer, 2007 WL 4180707, *2 (D. Neb. 2007) (FHA doesn’t foreclose\njurisdiction for suits against states ).  Cf. Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Fla., 517 U.S. 44, 74 (1996)\n(suit under Ex parte Young would be inconsistent with the “detailed remedial scheme” set out in\nthe Indian Regulatory Gaming Act, 25 U.S.C. § 2710).\nIn addition, in Section 1003 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, 100 Stat.\n1845, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-7, Congress expressly abrogated the states’ sovereign immunity against\nsuits brought in federal court to enforce Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000d, and provided that, in a suit against a state, “remedies (including remedies both at law\nand in equity) are available . . . to the same extent as such remedies are available . . . in the suit\nagainst any public or private entity other than a State.”  42 U.S.C. § 2000d-7(a)(2).  Alexander v.\nSandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 280 (2001); Goonewardena v. NY, 475 F. Supp. 2d 310, 328 (S.D.N.Y.\n2007).  Accordingly, plaintiffs can bring suit directly against the State of Louisiana under Title\nVI.  \nBecause there is an adequate remedy at law here for plaintiffs’ claims, § 704 bars this\naction against HUD.  In cases similar to this one, the D.C., Third, and Fourth Circuits found that\nsuits directly against an allegedly discriminating non-federal entity provided an adequate\nalternative to APA review, and therefore suit under the APA was precluded under § 704.  In\nWash. Legal Found. v. Alexander, 984 F.2d 483 (D.C. Cir. 1993), the D.C. Circuit considered a\nchallenge under the APA to the alleged failure of the Department of Education to enforce the\nnon-discrimination provisions of Title VI against educational institutions that offered some\nscholarships only to minority students.  Id. at 484.  The court held that because plaintiffs had “an\nimplied right of action under Title VI against the individual colleges and law schools to redress\nany discrimination they have allegedly suffered, . . .that alternative remedy . . . preclude[d] a\n-33-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 45 of 57\nremedy under the APA.”  Id. at 486.  See also Jersey Heights Neighborhood Ass’n v. Glendening,\n174 F.3d 180, 191-92 (4th Cir. 1999) (dismissing APA claim against federal defendants because\ncourt found that a Title VI claim pursued directly against the state, as a recipient of federal\nfunding, provided adequate alternative remedy).  Similarly, in Women’s Equity Action League\n(“WEAL”) v. Cavazos, 906 F.2d 742 (D.C. Cir. 1990), the D.C. Circuit considered a broad\nchallenge to the alleged failure of the Departments of Education and Labor to enforce various\ncivil rights statutes against educational institutions receiving federal funds.  The court upheld the\ndistrict court’s dismissal of the complaint, finding that no right of action was available to the\nplaintiffs under the APA because of the existence of “implied rights of action against\nfederally-funded institutions to redress discrimination proscribed by Titles VI and IX and express\nrights of action against federally-funded discriminators under . . . the Rehabilitation Act.” Id. at\n750 (citation omitted). \nIn Am. Disabled for Attendant Programs Today (“ADAPT”) v. HUD, 170 F.3d 381 (3d\nCir. 1999), the Third Circuit addressed an APA suit against HUD brought by organizations\nrepresenting disabled individuals alleging that HUD had abdicated its duty under the FHA and\nviolated its own regulations under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  Id. at 382.  The court\ndismissed the claims, finding that “a private right of action against individual housing providers\nthat receive federal funding is provided for in the text of the [FHA].  This remedy is clearly\n‘adequate’ in the section 704 sense, and so judicial review is inappropriate on all counts.”  Id. at\n390.  These direct statutory remedies against the entity alleged to be engaging in discrimination\nwere held to be “‘adequate,’ therefore preclusive of a default remedy under the APA.”  Id. \nMoreover, it is well settled that “[a] legal remedy is not inadequate for purposes of\n[preclusion of review under] the APA because it is procedurally inconvenient for a given\nplaintiff, or because plaintiffs have inadvertently deprived themselves of an opportunity to pursue\n-34-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 46 of 57\nthat remedy.”  Town of Sanford v. U.S., 140 F.3d 20, 23 (1st Cir. 1998).  See also Martinez v.\nU.S., 333 F.3d 1295, 1320 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (“The fact that the complaint was untimely filed . . .\ndoes not mean that that court could not offer a full and adequate remedy; it merely means that\n[plaintiff] did not file his complaint in time to take advantage of that remedy.”); Sable Commc’n\nof Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 827 F.2d 640, 642 (9th Cir. 1987).  Indeed, the D.C. Circuit has held that\nthe APA “bar[s] suits where a plaintiff’s injury may be remedied in another action, even if that\nremedy would have no effect upon the challenged agency action.”  Coker v. Sullivan, 902 F.2d\n84, 90 n.5 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (citation omitted).  In Coker, the court held that “[a]ctions directly\nagainst the states are not merely adequate; they are also more suitable avenues for plaintiffs to\npursue the relief they seek.  The states are the immediate cause of the injuries of which the\nCokers and the Porters complain; these plaintiffs ask [the federal defendant] not to refrain from\nharming them but rather to cure their state-created injuries.”  Id. at 90. \nThe courts’ holdings in Wash. Legal Found., WEAL, and Coker control here, and the\nprinciples of Jersey Heights, and ADAPT apply as well.  Congress has provided plaintiffs with a\nfully adequate alternative remedy for their claimed injuries in the form of a cause of action\ndirectly against Louisiana state officials with respect to plaintiffs’ claims of discrimination under\nthe FHA and the HCDA, and directly against the state under Title VI.  Inasmuch as maintaining\nsuit directly against Louisiana state officials and the state provides an adequate legal remedy for\nall of plaintiffs’ claims (to the extent that they are cognizable at all), § 704 precludes plaintiffs\nfrom maintaining suit against HUD under the APA.  Thus, the APA would not provide a waiver\nof sovereign immunity by the United States in this instance.\n-35-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 47 of 57\n2. Plaintiffs’ claims for relief under 42 U.S.C. §§ 3608(d) and (e)(5) and\n42 U.S.C. § 5304(b)(2) are not reviewable under the APA\nThe APA also does not provide a waiver of immunity to review plaintiffs’ claims for\nrelief arising under 42 U.S.C. §§ 3608(d) and (e)(5) and 5304(b)(2) in this instance.  Sections\n3608(d) and (e)(5) require HUD to “administer [its] programs and activities relating to housing\nand urban development . . . in a manner affirmatively to further the purposes of this subchapter”\nand to “administer the programs and activities relating to housing and urban development in a\nmanner affirmatively to further [its fair housing ] policies.”  Id. §§ 3608(d) and (e)(5).  Similarly,\nthe § 5304(b)(2) requires that “grantees will affirmatively further fair housing.”  Id. § 5304(b)(2)\n(emphasis added).13  However, because the APA does not provide for review of HUD’s alleged\nfailure to follow these provisions, it does not provide a waiver of sovereign immunity.  Although\nthe APA allows reviewing courts to “compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably\ndelayed,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(1), the Supreme Court has unanimously held that a plaintiff cannot\nmaintain a § 706(1) claim absent a mandatory statutory obligation that an agency take the\nspecific, discrete action that the plaintiff wants it to take.  SUWA, supra, 542 U.S. at 64.  \nIn SUWA, the Supreme Court dismissed an APA claim that sought to compel the Interior\nDepartment to ban off-road vehicles in a wilderness area, because the statute at issue simply\ndirected the agency to preserve the character of wilderness areas.  Id. at 65-67.  The Court began\nits analysis by noting that the term “agency action,” although including “a failure to act,” is\ndefined in the first instance by reference to “a list of five categories of decisions made or\noutcomes implemented by an agency–‘agency rule, order, license, sanction [or] relief.’”  Id. at 62\n(quoting 5 U.S.C. § 551(13)).  The Court explained that: \n13  Although plaintiffs’ complaint alleges that both HUD and the LRA have violated 42\nU.S.C. § 5304(b)(2) in Count Two of their complaint, plaintiffs may have intended to allege only\nthat the LRA, as the grantee, has violated that provision, because it requires only that “grantees\nwill affirmatively further fair housing.”  Id.  \n-36-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 48 of 57\nAll of those categories involve circumscribed, discrete agency actions, as their\ndefinitions make clear:  “an agency statement of . . . future effect designed to\nimplement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy” (rule); a “final disposition . . . in\na matter other than rule making” (order); a “permit . . . or other form of\npermission” (license); a “prohibition . . . or taking [of] other compulsory or\nrestrictive action” (sanction); or a “grant of money, assistance, license, authority,”\netc., or “taking of other action on the application or petition of, and beneficial to, a\nperson” (relief). \nId. (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 551(4), (6), (8), (10), (11)) (emphasis added).  The Court then construed\nthe phrase “failure to act” as a failure to take one of the five agency actions earlier defined in\n§ 551(13), emphasizing that “[t]he important point is that a ‘failure to act’ is properly understood\nto be limited, as are the other items in § 551(13), to a discrete action.”  Id. at 62-63 (emphasis in\noriginal). \nThe Court then explained that “the only agency action that can be compelled under the\nAPA is action legally required.”  Id. at 63 (emphasis in original).  Therefore, “a claim under\n§ 706(1) can proceed only where a plaintiff asserts that an agency failed to take a discrete agency\naction that it is required to take.”  Id. at 64 (emphasis in original).  This limitation “rules out\njudicial direction of even discrete agency action that is not demanded by law.”  Id. at 65. \nIn SUWA, as in the present case, the plaintiffs alleged that an agency had failed to comply\nwith a broad statutory mandate.  The SUWA plaintiffs claimed that a statute requiring the Bureau\nof Land Management to “continue to manage [wilderness areas] in a manner so as not to impair\nthe suitability of such areas for preservation as wilderness,” 43 U.S.C. § 1782(c), forbade the\nagency from taking a particular action–permitting the use of off-road vehicles in certain\nwilderness areas.  Id. at 65.  The Supreme Court rejected the plaintiffs’ assertion, explaining: \nIf courts were empowered to enter general orders compelling compliance with\nbroad statutory mandates, they would necessarily be empowered, as well, to\ndetermine whether compliance was achieved–which would mean that it would\nultimately become the task of the supervising court, rather than the agency, to\nwork out compliance with the broad statutory mandate, injecting the judge into\nday-to-day agency management. . . . The prospect of pervasive oversight by\n-37-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 49 of 57\nfederal courts over the manner and pace of agency compliance with such\ncongressional directives is not contemplated by the APA. \nId. at 66-67 (citations and internal punctuation omitted). \nBefore the Supreme Court decided SUWA in 2004, some courts reviewing claims of\nagency inaction permitted claims under 42 U.S.C. § 3608(e)(5) to proceed even if a plaintiff did\nnot identify a discrete agency action that the agency was explicitly required to take.  See, e.g.,\nNAACP v. HUD, 817 F.2d 149, 160-61 (1st Cir. 1987) (Breyer, J.) (asserting that a court\napplying APA § 706(1) “can compel an official to exercise his discretion where he has obviously\nfailed or refused to do so”) (citation omitted).  This position is no longer tenable.  As noted\nabove, the unanimous Supreme Court opinion in SUWA (which Justice Breyer joined), explained\nthat if the relevant statutory provision provides the agency with discretion regarding the range of\nactions it may take, an APA claim cannot lie for agency inaction.  Rather, “§ 706(1) [of the APA]\nempowers a court only to compel an agency to perform a ministerial or non-discretionary act, or\nto take action upon a matter, without directing how it shall act.”  SUWA, 542 U.S. at 64\n(emphasis added).14   \nAs noted above, plaintiffs do not allege that HUD has failed to perform a particular\nministerial act.  Plaintiffs’ only allegations against HUD are that: (i) the LRA “proposed and\n14  For this reason, the unpublished decision in M&T Mortgage Corp. v. White, 2006 WL\n47467 (E.D.N.Y. 2006), in which the Court relied on the First Circuit’s NAACP opinion, is not\npersuasive.  Moreover, Darst-Webbe Tenant Ass’n Bd. v. St. Louis Hous. Auth., 417 F.3d 898,\n909 (8th Cir. 2005) (affirming the dismissal of an action alleging violations of § 3608(e)(5)),\ndoes not have any precedential value.  The Darst-Webbe panel merely addressed its earlier order\n(which pre-dated SUWA) that the district court, on remand, determine whether HUD had assessed\n“those aspects of its proposed course of action that would further limit the supply of genuinely\nopen housing” and assessed “those aspects of the proposed course of action that would increase\nthat supply.”  Id. at 907.  In so doing, the court found that its standard of review was merely “to\nassess whether HUD exercised its broad authority in a manner that demonstrates consideration\nof, and an effort to achieve, fair housing opportunities.”  Id.  However, because the court’s\nholding addressed an order that pre-dated SUWA, its finding is sui generis.  To the extent Darst-\nWebbe is in any way inconsistent with SUWA, this Court should simply disregard the decision.  \n-38-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 50 of 57\ndeveloped” the Road Home program, “in consultation with HUD,” (ii) HUD “approved the Road\nHome grant formula,” and (iii) the LRA administers the Road Home program “subject to\nongoing oversight and continuing approval of HUD.”  Compl. ¶¶ 49-51.  However: \na.  Plaintiffs’ challenge to HUD’s informal consultation is not final agency action. \nPlaintiffs do not allege and could not show, that HUD’s “consultation” with Louisiana\nconstituted final agency action reviewable under the APA.  5 U.S.C.§ 702.

Plaintiffs’ challenge to HUD’s approval of Louisiana’s Road Home program is moot. \nFor the reasons set forth above in Section IV(B), supra, plaintiffs cannot maintain their challenge\nto HUD’s approval and continuing oversight of Louisiana’s use of disaster recovery CDBG funds\nthat HUD had already obligated to the state to administer the Road Home homeowners program,\nas that challenge is moot.  City of Houston, 24 F.3d at 1427. \nc.  HUD’s oversight of unobligated funds for the Road Home program is not reviewable\nunder APA § 706(1).

These challenges would fall under\n5 U.S.C. § 706(1), because all they allege is that HUD is failing to exercise its statutory authority. \nHowever, in alleging that HUD is violating §§ 3608(d) and (e)(5) and § 5304(b)(2), plaintiffs are\nmaking almost the identical claims that the Supreme Court rejected in SUWA.  Like the plaintiffs\nin SUWA, plaintiffs here are claiming that HUD’s duties under §§ 3608(d) and (e)(5) and\n§ 5304(b)(2) require HUD, in exercising its authority to obligate the remaining funds, to stop the\nLRA’s Road Home compensation and incentives grants for homeowners in its current form.  But\n-39-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 51 of 57\nin making these allegations, plaintiffs here, just like the plaintiffs in SUWA, do not identify a\ncircumscribed, discrete agency action that §§ 3608(d) and (e)(5) and § 5304(b)(2) require HUD\nto take.  Cf. Alliance to Save Mattaponi v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 515 F. Supp. 2d 1, 9-10\n(D.D.C. 2007) (finding that, because 33 U.S.C. § 1344(c) grants the EPA a discrete, discretionary\npower to veto Army Corps Clean Water Act permitting decisions, EPA’s alleged failure to\nexercise that veto power was reviewable under the APA).  Rather, plaintiffs’ complaint makes\nonly the vaguest allegations that, in continuing to oversee Louisiana’s Road Home program,\nHUD has failed to affirmatively further its fair housing obligations under §§ 3608(d) and (e)(5)\nand § 5304(b)(2).  Compl. ¶¶ 76-77.  Accordingly, in the present case, as in SUWA, the statutes\nunder which plaintiffs have filed suit are “mandatory as to the object to be achieved, but [they]\nleave[ the agency] a great deal of discretion in deciding how to achieve it.”  Id. at 66.  So much\ndiscretion, in fact, that HUD’s actions are unreviewable by a court, and the APA does not\nprovide a waiver of immunity in this instance.  In sum, plaintiffs cannot maintain their claims\nthat HUD violated its obligations under §§ 3608(d) and (e)(5) or § 5304(b)(2).  Because APA\nrelief would not be available here under APA § 706(1), these claims should be dismissed against\nHUD.\nE. The Complaint Should Be Dismissed Because Plaintiffs Fail to State a Claim\non Which Relief May Be Granted\n1.  Plaintiffs’ Disparate Impact Against HUD Should Be Dismissed\nBecause No Prohibited Discrimination Is Alleged\nCount One, ¶¶ 74-75, alleges that defendants violated 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a), and 42 U.S.C.\n§ 3605(a).  But plaintiffs fail to plead facts that would establish a violation of these provisions. \nSection 3604(a) provides, in relevant part, that it is unlawful:\nTo refuse to sell or rent after the making of a bona fide offer, or to refuse to \nnegotiate for the sale or rental of, or otherwise make unavailable or deny, a \ndwelling to any person because of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or\n-40-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 52 of 57\nnational origin.\n42 U.S.C. § 3604(a).  Section 3605 provides, in relevant part, that it is unlawful:\nfor any person or other entity whose business includes engaging in residential real\nestate transactions to discriminate against any person in making available such a\ntransaction, or in the terms of conditions of such transaction, because or race,\ncolor, religion, sex, handicap, familial statute, or national origin.\n42 U.S.C. § 3605(a) (emphasis added).  To establish a prima facie case of a violation of these\nprovisions, plaintiffs must allege facts showing that HUD’s actions produced a discriminatory\neffect against a protected class.  2922 Sherman Ave. Tenants’ Ass’n v. DC, 444 F.3d 673, 680\n(D.C. Cir. 2006).  See, e.g., Huntington Branch, NAACP v. Town of Huntington, 844 F.2d 926,\n934 (2d Cir. 1988) (“Under disparate impact analysis, as other circuits have recognized, a prima\nfacie case is established by showing that the challenged practice of the defendant actually or\npredictably results in racial discrimination; in other words that it has a discriminatory effect.”). \nSee also U.S. v. City of Black Jack, 508 F.2d 1179, 1184 (8th Cir. 1975) (same).  At the motion\nto dismiss stage, plaintiffs can establish a prima facie case of disparate impact by alleging “that a\nchallenged housing practice or policy has caused a statistically significant disparate effect on a\nprotected class.”  Graoch Assoc. v. Louisville/Jefferson Cty. Metro Human Relations Comm., 508\nF.3d 366, 390 (6th Cir. 2007). \nCount One alleges that HUD’s approval of the LRA’s Road Home program disparately\nimpacted African-Americans in violation of the FHA.  See Compl. ¶¶ 74-75.  However, plaintiffs\nfail to allege a prima facie case for disparate impact discrimination on the basis of race or color. \nPlaintiffs allege that “[t]he requirement that Road Home grant awards not exceed the pre-storm\nvalue of the home (where the pre-storm value is less than the cost of damage) has a\ndiscriminatory disparate impact on African Americans.”  Compl. ¶ 52.  Plaintiffs further allege\nthat “nearly 80% of homes owned by African Americans in New Orleans were valued at less than\n-41-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 53 of 57\n$100,000, while only about 33% of homes owned by whites were valued at less than $100,000.” \nId. ¶ 54.  Plaintiffs also allege that “approximately 93% of homes owned by African Americans\nin New Orleans were valued at less than $150,000, compared to 55% of homes owned by white\nhomeowners.”  Id.\nHowever, plaintiffs fail to allege that African American homeowners experience a\ndisparate impact in the amount they allegedly received under the Road Home grant award as\ncompared to white homeowners.  Compl. passim.  Although the program, to date, has served\nmore 140,000 homeowners, plaintiffs fail to allege statistically-significant disparities in the\namounts of the Road Home grant awards that they have received.  Thus, plaintiffs fail to allege a\nviolation of the FHA.  Cf. Mountain Side Mobile Estates P’ship v. HUD, 56 F.3d 1243, 1253\n(10th Cir. 1995) (“Although discriminatory effect is generally shown by statistical evidence, any\nstatistical analysis must involve the appropriate comparables.”). \nPlaintiffs also allege that “comparable” homes have lower values in African American\ncommunities than in white communities.  Compl. ¶ 53.  However, plaintiffs do not allege any\nstatistical disparity in support of this allegation.  Id. passim.  Nor do they allege that the\nappraisals for their home values are the result of different methods used for different races or\ndifferent neighborhoods.  Id.  To the contrary, Louisiana allows homeowners to provide their\nown pre-storm appraisals or to provide a post-storm appraisal from a licensed and certified\nLouisiana appraiser setting out the property’s pre-storm value.  See\nhttp://www.road2la.org/homeowner/default.htm.  Not surprisingly, plaintiffs have not alleged\nthat any lower value of their homes is the result of HUD’s actions in approving or overseeing the\nLRA’s Road Home program.  Thus, this allegation fails to allege a violation of the FHA against\nHUD.\nPlaintiffs also allege that African American recipients of Road Home grants are more\n-42-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 54 of 57\nlikely than white grantees to have a gap between their rebuilding resources and the cost to\nrebuild.  Compl. ¶¶ 56, 58.  Again, plaintiffs fail to allege any statistical disparity to support this\nallegation.  Compl. passim.  Moreover, for the reasons just stated, plaintiffs’ allegations belie the\nclaim that this gap produces a disparate impact based on race.  Nor do plaintiffs allege\nstatistically-significant disparities in the awarding of the Additional Compensation Grants of up\nto $50,000 for low- and moderate-income homeowners, the Individual Mitigation Measures, or\nthe Elevation Allowances to African American homeowners.  Id. \n Finally, plaintiffs fail to allege that HUD, as opposed to the LRA, violated § 3605.  In\norder to state a prima facie claim under this section, plaintiffs must plead that they attempted to\nengage in real estate-related transactions, that defendant refused to transact business with them\ndespite their qualifications, and that defendant continued to engage in that type of transaction\nwith other parties with similar qualifications.  Mich. Protection & Advocacy Serv., Inc. v. Babin,\n18 F.3d 337 (6th Cir. 1994).  Plaintiffs do not allege, nor could they allege, that HUD engaged in\nresidential real estate transactions with anyone.  See Compl. passim.  Thus, plaintiffs fail to state\na claim for relief under 42 U.S.C. § 3605 against HUD.\n2. Plaintiffs’ Remaining Claims Against HUD Should Be Dismissed\nCount One, ¶ 76, and Count Two allege that HUD failed to affirmatively further fair\nhousing in violation of 42 U.S.C. §§ 3608(d) and (e)(5) and in violation of 42 U.S.C.\n§ 5304(b)(2).  Compl. ¶¶ 76-77.  However, plaintiffs fail to plead facts that allege HUD has\nviolated these provisions.\nAs noted above, sections 3608(d) and (e)(5) requires HUD to “administer [its] programs\nand activities relating to housing and urban development . . . in a manner affirmatively to further\nthe purposes of this subchapter” and to “administer the programs and activities relating to\nhousing and urban development in a manner affirmatively to further [its fair housing] policies.” \n-43-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 55 of 57\n42 U.S.C. §§ 3608(d) and (e)(5).  By contrast, § 5304(b)(2) provides that a grant “shall be made\nonly if the grantee certifies to the satisfaction of [HUD] that . . . the grantee will affirmatively\nfurther fair housing.”  Id. § 5304(b)(2).  First, for the reasons set forth above in Section IV(D)(2),\nsupra, plaintiffs do not allege that HUD failed to take a discrete action that either §§ 3608(d) and\n(e)(5) or § 5304(b)(2) required HUD to take.  Compl. passim.  See McGrath v. HUD, 722 F.\nSupp. 902, 908 (D. Mass. 1989) (Section 3608(e)(5) “does not mandate specific actions or\nremedial plans which HUD should undertake”).  Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above,\nplaintiffs have failed to state a claim under Count One, ¶ 76, of the Complaint.\nSecond, as noted above, § 3608(d) and (e)(5) require HUD to affirmatively further fair\nhousing.  Id.  Plaintiffs only allegations about HUD are that: (i) the LRA “proposed and\ndeveloped” the Road Home program, “in consultation with HUD,” (ii) HUD “approved the Road\nHome grant formula,” and (iii) the LRA administers the Road Home program “subject to\nongoing oversight and continuing approval of HUD.”  Compl. ¶¶ 49-51.  Because, for the reasons\nset forth above in Section IV(D), supra, plaintiffs fail to state a claim that HUD violated any\nother provision of the FHA, plaintiffs have failed to make sufficient allegations that HUD failed\nto further fair housing.  Plaintiffs have not alleged that HUD failed to consider the racial impact\nof the LRA’s Road Home program.  Compl. passim.  Cf. Pleune, 765 F. Supp. at 47.  Rather, the\nHCDA requires the grantee to certify that it will affirmatively further fair housing in order to\nobtain federal funds.  42 U.S.C. § 5304(b)(2).  Plaintiffs do not allege that Louisiana failed to\nsubmit such a certification.  Compl. passim.  Accordingly, plaintiffs have failed to state a claim\nthat HUD has violated § 3608(d) and (e)(5).\nThird, plaintiffs have failed to allege that HUD violated § 5304(b)(2).  As noted above,\nthis section provides that a grant “shall be made only if the grantee certifies to the satisfaction of\n[HUD] that . . . the grantee will affirmatively further fair housing.”  Id. § 5304(b)(2).  As just\n-44-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22    Filed 03/06/09   Page 56 of 57\nexplained, plaintiffs do not allege that the LRA failed to certify that it would affirmatively further\nfair housing.  See Compl. passim.  \nIn sum, plaintiffs fail to state a claim on which relief may be granted against HUD.\nV. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons set forth above, this Court should grant HUD’s Motion to Dismiss for\nLack of Jurisdiction and for Failure to State a Claim Upon Which Relief May be Granted. \nDated: March 6, 2009\nRespectfully submitted,\nMICHAEL F.

I am the Deputy Director, Office of Block Grant Assistance (“OBGA”), Office of \nCommunity Planning and Development (“CPD”), U.S. Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment (“HUD”).  I have held this position since February 2009.  From August 2007 to \nFebruary 2009, I was the Director, Disaster Recovery and Special Issues Division (“DRSI”), in \nthe OBGA.  In my DRSI capacity, my duties included general oversight responsibility for grants \nmade from emergency supplemental appropriations of Community Development Block Grant \n(“CDBG”) funds for recovery from certain Presidentially-declared disasters.  Prior to this, I was \na Community Planning and Development Specialist in DRSI.  In that capacity, I was responsible \nfor drafting program technical information and requirements, training grantees, and \nadministering the reporting system for disaster recovery grants.  I submit this declaration in \nsupport of Defendant HUD’s Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction in the above-captioned \naction.  I base this declaration on personal knowledge and on information obtained in my official \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22-1    Filed 03/06/09   Page 2 of 11\ncapacities as Director of the DRSI and as a Community Planning and Development Specialist at \nDRSI. \nThe Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 \n2.    The Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (“HCDA” or “Act”), as \namended, 42 U.S.C. § 5301 et seq., seeks to develop viable urban communities by providing \ndecent housing, a suitable living environment, and expanding economic opportunities, \nprincipally for persons of low and moderate income.  The statute authorizes HUD to make \ngrants, known as Community Development Block Grants (“CDBG”) to states, tribes, and local \ngovernments to carry out activities in accordance with provisions of the Act, and sets out 25 \nbroad categories of activities for which grantees may use funds.  The Act requires that not less \nthan 70 percent of grant funds be used for the benefit of low- and moderate-income persons.  The \nAct is a federal block grant statute, under which the day-to-day administration of the federal \nprogram, including the actual expenditure of federal funds, is delegated to state and local \nauthorities.   \n3.    The HCDA distributes funds appropriated by Congress through recipients outside \nthe federal government.  HUD’s role is confined to ensuring that the state’s interpretation of the \nstatutory and regulatory requirements “are not plainly inconsistent with the Act.”  24 C.F.R. \n§ 570.480(c) (giving “maximum feasible deference” to a state’s interpretation of these \nrequirements). \n4.    To obtain federal funds, state or local authorities must develop a five-year \nconsolidated plan that assesses housing and homeless needs, analyzes the states’ or local \nauthorities’ housing markets, sets forth their strategic plans for meeting priority needs, and sets \nout action plans.  The action plans, in turn, must include required certifications that the \n  2\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22-1    Filed 03/06/09   Page 3 of 11\napplicants will comply with the requirements of the program.  24 C.F.R. § 570.485, id. Part 91, \nSubparts C & D.     \n5.    HUD’s regulations implementing the HCDA require grantees to certify that their \nprojected use of funds “will give maximum feasible priority to activities . . .[(i)] of benefit to \nlow- and moderate-income families, . . .[(ii) that seek] elimination of slums and blight, [or (iii) \nthat seek] to meet other community development needs having a particular urgency because \nexisting conditions pose a serious threat to health and welfare.”  24 C.F.R. § 570.483.  The \nregulations provide that an activity generally will be considered to meet the national objective of \nbenefit to low and moderate income persons if: (i) the activity benefits an area that is at least 51 \npercent low and moderate income; (ii) the activity benefits a limited low-and moderate-income \nclientele, including services or facilities for the homeless, abused children, the elderly, or \nmigrant farm workers; (iii) the activity provides or improves permanent housing to be occupied \nby a low- or moderate-income person; or (iv) the activity is designed to create permanent jobs \nwhere at least 51 percent of the jobs will be held by or made available to low- and moderate-\nincome persons.  Id.  \n6.    A CDBG grantee is also responsible for meeting all program requirements.  Each \nactivity must be an eligible one as defined by the statute, meet a national objective, and have \nbeen through citizen participation as part of the action plan development and submission process.  \nGrantees must be able to account for all grant funds, comply with all reporting requirements, \nperform environmental reviews, and meet all applicable relocation, fair housing, equal \nopportunity, and labor standards.  24 C.F.R. § 570.487-491.   \n7.    After developing proposed plans, the applicants must publish the plans for citizen \ncomment.  24 C.F.R. § 91.115; id. § 91.320.  The applicants then submit the plan, summaries of \ncitizen comments, and signed certifications to HUD.  Id; see also id. § 91.325.  \n  3\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22-1    Filed 03/06/09   Page 4 of 11\n8.    A grantee may request and receive technical assistance from HUD program staff \nat any time.  HUD’s technical assistance typically involves consultation with the grantee to \ndetermine the grantee’s objectives and its proposed program designs.  HUD then provides \nadvice, training, or program models that will ensure the grantee will be able to comply with \nCDBG program requirements while carrying out its purposes and implementing its programs. \n9.    HUD’s review of the applicant’s plan is limited.  24 C.F.R. § 91.500.  HUD has \n45 days to review the plan, and the plan is deemed approved unless HUD notifies the jurisdiction \nwithin the 45-day period that the plan is disapproved.  Id. § 91.500(a).  HUD only may \ndisapprove a plan if it is inconsistent with the purposes of the Act, is substantially incomplete, \nthe certifications are not acceptable, or if HUD determines that the applicant has not complied \nwith the CDBG requirements.  Id. § 91.500(b).  The regulations do not permit HUD to \ndisapprove an application based on the grantee’s choice of eligible activities.  Id. \n10.    In order to ensure that CDBG funds are not misused, the HCDA authorizes HUD \nto audit the records of HCDA programs, and to recover improperly expended funds.  HUD may \ntake corrective actions ranging from issuing a warning letter to instituting collections procedures \nto recover improperly expended funds.  24 C.F.R. § 570.495.  After reasonable notice and \nopportunity for a hearing, HUD may terminate, reduce, or limit the availability of payments to a \ngrant recipient for failure to substantially comply with the provisions of the Act.  24 C.F.R. § \n570.496(b), (d).  The statute further authorizes the Department of Justice, upon a referral from \nHUD, to bring a civil action to recover misspent or misused CDBG funds.  24 C.F.R. § \n570.496(c).  \nPub. L. Nos. 109-148, 109-234, and 110-116 \n11.    In response to the 2005 Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, Congress passed \nthree special appropriations to provide disaster recovery CDBG funds to affected areas in five \n  4\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22-1    Filed 03/06/09   Page 5 of 11\nstates, including Louisiana.  See Pub. L. No. 109-148, 119 Stat. 2779 (Dec. 30, 2005) (the “first \nappropriation”); Pub. L. No. 109-234, 120 Stat. 418 (June 15, 2006) (the “second \nappropriation”); and Pub. L. No. 110-116, 121 Stat. 1343 (Nov. 13, 2007) (the “third \nappropriation”).  The first appropriation provided $11,500,000,000 in CDBG funds to the \naffected states, which Congress directed to “be administered through an entity . . . designated by \n. . . each State.”  Pub. L. 109-148.  This appropriation required HUD to “waive, or specify \nalternative requirements for, any provision of any statute or regulation[, including the HCDA and \nits implementing regulations] that [HUD] administers in connection with the obligation by \n[HUD] or the use by the recipient of these funds or guarantees,” except for requirements related \nto fair housing, nondiscrimination, labor standards, and the environment, “upon a request by the \nState that such waiver is required to facilitate the use of such funds or guarantees, and a finding \nby the Secretary that such waiver would not be inconsistent with the overall purpose of the \nstatute, as modified.”  Id.  The first appropriation also authorized HUD to “waive the \nrequirement [of the HCDA] that activities benefit persons of low and moderate income, except \nthat at least 50 percent of the funds made available under this heading must benefit primarily \npersons of low and moderate income unless [HUD] otherwise makes a finding of compelling \nneed.”  Id.  The appropriation required HUD to “publish in the Federal Register any waiver of \nany statute or regulation.”  Id.  The appropriation also provided that it would not lapse.  Id. \n(providing that the funds will “remain available until expended.”).  Finally, the appropriation \nrequired, prior to the obligation of these funds to each state, that the state submit a plan to HUD \n“detailing the proposed use of all funds, including criteria for eligibility and how the use of these \nfunds will address long-term recovery and restoration of infrastructure.”  Id. \n12.    The second appropriation provided an additional $5,200,000,000 in CDBG funds \nto the affected states and authorized (although it did not require) HUD to make these same \n  5\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22-1    Filed 03/06/09   Page 6 of 11\nstatutory and regulatory waivers authorized by the first appropriation.  Pub. L. No. 109-234.  \nThis appropriation earmarked $1,112,650,000 for affordable rental housing programs.  Id.  The \nremainder of the second appropriation was substantially identical to the first.  The third \nappropriation provided an additional $3,000,000,000 “solely for the purpose of covering costs \nassociated with otherwise uncompensated but eligible claims that were filed on or before July 31, \n2007, under the Road Home program administered by the State in accordance with plans \napproved by the Secretary.”  Pub. L. No. 110-116.       \nHUD Waivers of CDBG Program Requirements  \nand Louisiana’s Action Plan for CDBG Disaster Recovery Funds \n \n13.    On February 13, 2006, HUD published a Federal Register notice implementing \nthe requirements of the first appropriation.  71 Fed. Reg. 7666 (Feb. 13, 2006).  HUD allocated \n$6,210,000,000 of the first appropriation to Louisiana.   As directed by Congress in the first \nappropriation, HUD waived many standard certifications of the CDBG program, including the \nrequirement that 70 percent of funds be used for activities that benefit low- and moderate-income \npersons, in order “to give grantees even greater flexibility to carry out recovery activities within \nthe confines of the CDBG program national objectives.”  71 Fed. Reg. at 7667.  In their place, \nHUD substituted alternative certifications.  Pursuant to the first appropriation, HUD required the \nstates to certify that activities funded “be for necessary expenses related to disaster relief, long-\nterm recovery, and restoration of infrastructure in the most impacted and distressed areas related \nto the consequences of the hurricanes.”  Id. at 7670.  As also directed by the first appropriation, \nHUD required that, overall, at least 50 percent of disaster recovery grant funds be used for \nactivities that principally benefit low- and moderate-income persons.  Id. at 7667; see also id. at \n7668.  As further directed by the first appropriation, HUD still required the state to certify that it \nwill affirmatively further fair housing, “which means that it will conduct an analysis to identify \n  6\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22-1    Filed 03/06/09   Page 7 of 11\nimpediments to fair housing choice within the state, take appropriate actions to overcome the \neffects of any impediments identified through that analysis, and maintain records reflecting the \nanalysis and actions in this regard.”  Id. at 7671.  HUD did not waive the CDBG program’s \nfinancial accountability requirements.   \n14.    Louisiana submitted its first action plan in early 2006 and made all required \nalternative certifications at that time, including the certification that the state would affirmatively \nfurther fair housing.  As is required by the CDBG program, the state already had produced a pre-\nstorm Analysis and Impediments (“AI”) to fair housing.  HUD advised Louisiana to review its \nAI post-storm and make any updates the state deemed necessary.  Louisiana later made these \nsame certifications to obtain funds from the second and third appropriations. \nLouisiana’s Road Home Program and HUD’s \nRole in Reviewing, Approving and Monitoring the Program \n \n15.    On May 12, 2006, Louisiana submitted Amendment 1 to its original action plan, \nknown as the Road Home Program.  The program consists of: (i) homeowner compensation and \nincentives programs; (ii) workforce and affordable rental housing programs; (iii) homeless \nhousing programs; and, (iv) developer incentive programs.  The Road Home program is \nadministered by the State of Louisiana through the Louisiana Office of Community Development \nand the Louisiana Recovery Authority and is funded by HUD through the CDBG program.  The \nState of Louisiana is responsible for the implementation, design, and administration of the Road \nHome program in conformance with the applicable CDBG program requirements set by HUD. \n16.    In designing the Road Home homeowner compensation and incentives program, \nLouisiana requested, and HUD provided, some technical assistance.  The state evaluated the \nrelative costs of implementing a housing rehabilitation and reconstruction program as compared \nto implementing a homeowner compensation and incentives program.  State staff called HUD \n  7\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22-1    Filed 03/06/09   Page 8 of 11\nstaff several times a week throughout 2006 regarding the details of the homeowner program \ndesign.  HUD’s guidance focused on how the activity could meet CDBG national objectives and \nhow the state could manage the program to account for all program funds while meeting the \ndisaster recovery purpose of the supplemental appropriations.   HUD did not make any of the \nstate’s program decisions or set any funding strategies in the Road Home Program.  Most of \nHUD’s technical assistance was provided by telephone.  \n17.    Part of the technical assistance HUD provided to state staff concerned sound \nfinancial management principles.  Financial management principles guide the grantee in the \ndesign of a program that provides the smallest amount of resources necessary to achieve a \ndesired result.  HUD explained to state staff that, for example, the compensation and incentives \nprogram launched by the state of New York following September 11, 2001, provided no more \nthan $14,500 to any household and achieved success in meeting its goals.  The city of Grand \nForks, North Dakota, provided $5,000 loan payments as incentives to homeowners who \nremained in the city for disaster recovery after floods in 1997 caused significant damage to the \ncity and its residences. \n18.    As it developed the Road Home program, Louisiana ultimately chose to provide \ncompensation and incentive grants to eligible homeowners affected by Hurricanes Rita or \nKatrina of up to $150,000.  Louisiana decided to base the amount of the compensation and \nincentives grant on the lower of the pre-storm, fair-market value of the home, or the cost to \nrepair the home.   \n19.    In developing the Road Home program, the state considered basing the \ncompensation and incentives payment amounts on the tax valuations of homes.  As part of the \ntechnical assistance HUD provided to the state, HUD stated its concern about using tax values as \npart of the basis for the calculation of the homeowner payment amount because the tax valuation \n  8\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22-1    Filed 03/06/09   Page 9 of 11\nsystem(s) in Louisiana, and in New Orleans Parish in particular, were unreliable, resulting in \nvastly different values for similar homes, with no rational basis.  The state ultimately chose not \nto use tax values as a basis for providing compensation and incentives grants.  \n20.    Although the state chose to base the calculation of the homeowner compensation \nand incentives grant on either the pre-storm property value or the cost of storm damage, \ncompensation and incentives under the Road Home program are not actually for storm damage.  \nThe Road Home program provides compensation and incentives for the homeowner’s agreement \nto meet certain recovery conditions, such as remaining in a certain geographic area, maintaining \nflood insurance on a dwelling, and meeting modern building codes within a prescribed period of \ntime.  \n21.    Louisiana also provides Additional Compensation Grants of up to $50,000 for \ncertain homeowners.  Total compensation and incentive grants are still capped at $150,000. \nLouisiana offers Additional Compensation and incentives Grant to applicants with household \nincomes 80 percent and below the median income in the parish where the house was located.  In \naddition to the Additional Compensation Grants, Louisiana provides compensation and \nincentives grants to homeowners via Individual Mitigation Measures and Elevation Incentives.  \nIndividual Mitigation Measures provide incentive grants to homeowners to install home \n“hardening” features that will protect homes from future storm damage, including storm shutters \nand roof tie downs.  Elevation Incentives are grants to elevate site-built homes and mobile homes \nto meet FEMA’s current Advisory Base Flood Elevation or Base Flood Elevation levels to \nprotect against future floods. \n22.    As part of the technical assistance HUD provided to Louisiana, HUD reviewed \nthe Road Home program’s ability to help Louisiana meet the overall benefit requirements of the \nspecial appropriations.  As noted above, the special appropriations’ overall benefit requirement is \n  9\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22-1    Filed 03/06/09   Page 10 of 11\nthat 50 percent of the state’s disaster recovery CDBG expenditures will support activities that \nbenefit low- and moderate-income persons.  To meet that requirement, Louisiana can count \nhomeowner payments to low- and moderate-income households and rental projects that house \nlow- and moderate-income tenants toward the overall requirement, but it cannot count payments \nto above-income homeowners or for above-income rental projects.  HUD determined that \nLouisiana’s inclusion of the Additional Compensation Grant, Individual Mitigation Measures, \nand Elevation Allowances could help the state meet the overall benefit requirement. \n23.    On June 14, 2006, HUD published a Federal Register notice granting additional \nwaivers to Louisiana and approving Louisiana’s Road Home program.  71 Fed. Reg. 34451 (June \n14, 2006).  Finding that additional waivers and alternative requirements are not inconsistent with \nthe overall purpose of the HCDA, HUD waived statutory and regulatory requirements to allow \nLouisiana to provide compensation to homeowners whose homes were damaged, “if the \nhomeowners agree to meet the stipulations of the published program design.”  Id.  HUD also \nallowed Louisiana to “offer disaster recovery or mitigation housing incentives to promote \nhousing development or resettlement in particular geographic areas.”  Id. at 34453.  In addition, \nHUD approved Louisiana’s use of disaster recovery CDBG funds for, among other things, (i) \ngovernment buildings; (ii) special economic development job-retention activities; (iii) down \npayment assistance for new construction; (iv) support of the tourism industry; (v) relocation \nassistance; and (vi) the one-for-one replacement requirement of housing units damaged by \ndisaster.  Id. at 34452-53.   \n24.    On March 6, 2007, HUD provided additional waivers that allowed Louisiana to \nuse CDBG disaster recovery funds for, among other things, (i) research, commercialization, and \neducational enhancement; (ii) operating subsidies for affordable rental housing; and (iii) rental \nand utility payment assistance.  72 Fed. Reg. 10014 (Mar. 6, 2007).   \n  10\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22-1    Filed 03/06/09   Page 11 of 11\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01938-HHK   Document 22-2    Filed 03/06/09   Page 1 of 1\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\nGREATER NEW ORLEANS FAIR HOUSING )\n  ACTION CENTER, et al., )\n)\nPlaintiffs, )\n) No. 1:08-cv-1938-HHK \nv. )\n)\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND  )\n  URBAN DEVELOPMENT, et al.,  )\n)\nDefendants. )\nORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT U.S. DEPARTMENT \nOF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT’S MOTION TO DISMISS\nBefore this Court is the motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and for failure to state a\nclaim on which relief can be granted of defendant, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment (“HUD”).
