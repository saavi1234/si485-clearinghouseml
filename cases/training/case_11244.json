The plaintiff, represented by private counsel, alleged that defendant's practices, resulting in the incarceration of indigent residents that failed to pay traffic fines violated the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments. The plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment that the practices violated the plaintiffs' rights, an injunction enjoining the alleged practices, compensatory and punitive damages, and attorneys' fees. </p><p>Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that his and others' rights were violated by the City's practice of arresting individuals for alleged Motor Vehicle Code violations and then subjecting them to incarceration following Philadelphia Traffic Court proceedings conducted without the assistance of counsel, notice of specific charges against them, opportunity to prepare a defense, cross-examine witnesses, or offer evidence on their own behalf.  The plaintiff and other members of the class were allegedly not released until they paid substantial amounts of money to satisfy fines levied against them. </p><p>On March 18, 2003, the District Court (Judge Timothy J. Savage) ordered that no defendant brought before The Philadelphia Traffic Court shall be ordered incarcerated for failure to post bail or security pending a trial at which the defendant shall be afforded the right to counsel and shall be advised of his or her right to appeal to the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas.</p><p>On June 11, 2003, the parties submitted a settlement agreement. Subsequently, on July 8, 2003, the District Court (Judge Savage) issued a settlement order resolving the case. The settlement order, pursuant to the parties' settlement agreement, certified the proposed class solely as to the issues of declaratory and injunctive relief and acknowledged that the parties had engaged in serious, good faith negotiations relating to the establishment of procedures to resolve the issues related to the class action. More specific terms of the settlement agreement are not readily available. </p><p></p>",

The District Court ( Judge Timothy J.

KELLY, \nIndividually as President Judge of \nPhiladelphia Traffic Court, \nHONORABLE FORTUNATO PERRI, \nIndividually  as Administrative Judge \nof Philadelphia Traffic Court, \nOFFICERS JOHN DOE(S) and \nOFFICERS RICHARD ROE(S), \nIndividually as Officers of the \nPhiladelphia Police Department, \nDefendants \nCOMPLAINT \nPreliminary Statement \n1. Plaintiff Ebony Davis was arrested by Philadelphia police officers who erroneously claimed \nthat he owed outstanding fines and costs in connection with alleged violations ofthe Pennsylvania \nMotor Vehicle Code. The officers failed to consider available information which demonstrated that \nPlaintiff Davis  was  not  the  individual who  had  committed the  alleged Motor Vehicle Code \nviolations.  Despite the  absence of probable cause  to arrest,  Plaintiff was  detained, searched, \nhandcuffed and transported to Philadelphia Traffic Court. After a Traffic Court proceeding at which \nhe was not afforded counsel, notice ofthe specific charges against him, the opportunity to prepare \na defense, to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him, and to present evidence on his \n\nCase 2:03-cv-01400-TJS   Document 1   Filed 03/04/03   Page 2 of 18\nown behalf, Plaintiffwas sentenced to aperiod ofincarceration in the Philadelphia County Prison \nSystem.  Plaintiff, who is indigent, was forced to remain in custody for nearly one month because \nhe was unable to remit a portion of the outstanding fines and costs to secure his release, a right \ngranted only to those with the means to make substantial monetary payments. \n2.  On behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, Plaintiff seeks to enjoin Defendants' \npattern, practice and policy of unlawfully arresting, prosecuting and incarcerating individuals on \nalleged Motor Vehicle Code violations in the absence of probable cause and without the right to \ncounsel andtoa fairtrial.  The named Plaintiffand thePlaintiffClass have been and continue tobe \ndeprived ofrights guaranteed by the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United \nStates Constitution and 42 U.S.c. §1983.  The named Plaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive \ndamages as a result of the harms  caused by Defendants'  actions and the loss of fundamental \nconstitutional rights.  The Plaintiff Class seeks a declaratory judgment that the acts complained of \nherein are unconstitutional and injunctive relief to prevent further civil rights violations. \nJurisdiction \n3.  This action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.c. §1983.  Jurisdiction is based upon 28 U.S.C. \n§§133l and 1343 (1), (3), (4) and the aforementioned statutory provision.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.c. \n§§2201 and 2202, this Court has jurisdiction to declare the rights of the parties and to grant all \nfurther relief found necessary and proper. \n2\n \n\nCase 2:03-cv-01400-TJS   Document 1   Filed 03/04/03   Page 3 of 18\nParties \n4.  Plaintiff Ebony Davis is a citizen of the Eastern District ofPennsylvania and at all \ntimes relevant to this action resided in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. \n5.  Defendant City of Philadelphia is a municipality of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania \nthat operates and funds Philadelphia Traffic Court and the Philadelphia Police Department which \nemploys the other named defendants, including Defendants Kelly, Perri, Doe(s) and Roe(s). \n6.  Defendant Philadelphia Traffic Court is a governmental agency funded by the City \nofPhilade1phia which is responsible for the daily operation, direction and control ofall proceedings \nconducted in Philadelphia Traffic Court. \n7.  Defendants, Honorable Francis E. Kelly and Honorable Fortunato Perri, were at all times \nrelevant to this action President Judge  and Administrative Judge, respectively, of Philadelphia \nTraffic Court and, in those capacities, exercised supervisory and administrative authority over the \noperationofPhiladelphiaTraffic Court anditsofficials andemployees. They arebeingsuedintheir \nindividual capacities as supervisors and administrators of Philadelphia Traffic Court.  At all times \nrelevant to this action, Defendant Kelly was and is a final policy and decision-maker for Defendants \nCity of Philadelphia and Philadelphia Traffic  Court.  Defendant Perri was  a final policy  and \ndecision-maker for Defendants City ofPhiladelphia and Philadelphia Traffic Court with respect to \nthe claims raised herein until his removal as Administrative Judge on or about December 1, 2002. \n8.  Defendant Police Officers Roe(s) and Doe(s) are police officers for the Philadelphia Police \nDepartment who, at all times relevant to this action, acted under color ofstate law.  They are being \nsued in their individual capacities as police officers. \n9.  At all relevant times, all Defendants were acting under color of state law and in concert and \n3\n \n\nCase 2:03-cv-01400-TJS   Document 1   Filed 03/04/03   Page 4 of 18\nagreement with each other to improperly deprive the named Plaintiffand the PlaintiffClass oftheir \nconstitutional and statutory rights. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS OF THE PLAINTIFF CLASS \n10.  Plaintiff Davis seeks to maintain this action on behalf of himself and all others similarly \nsituated pursuant to Rules 23(a) and (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Plaintiff Davis \nrepresents a class ofpersons who have been or will be detained, arrested, searched, prosecuted and \nincarcerated by Defendants without the right to counsel and to a fair trial.  The class members have \nbeen, are and will be subjected to deprivations of their rights under the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and \nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and 42 U.S.c. §1983. The PlaintiffClass \ntherefore seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to eliminate Defendants' actions, policies and \npractices which caused, are causing, and will continue to cause constitutional violations. \n11.  The Plaintiff Class consists of individuals who have been and will be arrested for alleged \nMotor Vehicle Code violations and subjected to periods ofincarceration as a result ofPhiladelphia \nTrafficCourtproceedingsconductedwithouttheassistance ofcounsel,notice ofthespecificcharges \nagainst them, the opportunity to prepare a defense, to confront and cross-examine the witnesses \nagainst them and to offer evidence on their own behalf. \n12. The requirements ofRules 23(a) and (b) are satisfied by this class action.  Upon information \nand belief,  the Plaintiff Class consists of more than one hundred individuals and will  include \nadditional individuals in the future, thereby making joinder of all members impractical. \n13.  There are questions of law and fact common to the class, including the constitutionality of \nDefendants' practices, customs and policies.  The claims of the named Plaintiff are typical of the \nclaims ofthe class and he will fairly and adequately represent and protect the interests ofthe class. \n4 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-01400-TJS   Document 1   Filed 03/04/03   Page 5 of 18\n14. PlaintiffDavis is an adequate representative ofthe PlaintiffClass as he was and is subject to \nDefendants' pattern, practice and policy of unlawfully arresting,  prosecuting and incarcerating \nindividuals on alleged Motor Vehicle Code violations without the right to counsel and a fair trial. \nIt is the existence of this pattern, practice and policy that gives rise to questions of law and fact \ncommon to all members of the Plaintiff Class. \n15.  Upon information and belief, there is no pending litigation concerning these issues which \nwould be disrupted by maintaining this matter as a class action.  Moreover, this is the appropriate \nforum for this litigation.  To the extent that management of this matter as a class action will pose \ndifficulties, the fact that the Plaintiff Class is represented by experienced civil rights litigators and \nthe law firm of'Kairys, Rudovsky, Epstein and Messing will substantially reduce the burdens on the \nCourt and litigants. \n16. Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the Plaintiff \nClass, thereby making final injunctive and declaratory relief appropriate with respect to the class as \na whole. \n17. Over an extended period of time, including but not limited to the period from March 1, 2001 \nto the present, members of the Plaintiff Class were arrested by Defendants Roe(s), Philadelphia \npolice officers, on the basis of allegations that they owed fines and costs in connection with Motor \nVehicle Code violations. \n18. Members ofthePlaintiffClass were transportedtoPhiladelphiaTraffic Court where theywere \nfurther detained and appeared before Traffic Court judges on violations of the Pennsylvania Motor \nVehicle Code, summary offenses punishable under Pennsylvania law by a maximum period of \nninety days incarceration and a $300 fine. Upon information and belief, most ifnot all members of \n5\n \n\nCase 2:03-cv-01400-TJS   Document 1   Filed 03/04/03   Page 6 of 18\nthePlaintiffClasswere chargedwith anumber ofoutstandingMotorVehicleCode violationswhich \ncarried potential consecutive prison sentences in excess of six months. \n19. At the Traffic Court proceedings, members of the Plaintiff Class who were indigent and \nunable to afford private counsel were not advised of their right to counsel nor provided with the \nassistance of counsel. \n20.  At the Traffic Court proceedings, members of the Plaintiff Class were not advised of the \nspecific charges against them and were not afforded the opportunity to prepare a defense, to confront \nand cross-examine the witnesses against them and to present evidence on their own behalf. \n21. Members ofthe Plaintiff Class were sentenced to periods ofincarceration in the Philadelphia \nCounty Prison System. \n22.  The Traffic Court judges further ordered that members of the Plaintiff Class were to be held \nin the Philadelphia County Prison System until dates certain or until substantial amounts ofmoney \nwere paid to secure their release. \n23. Asmembers ofthePlaintiffClasswere financiallyunable tomake therequiredpayments,they \nwere held in the Philadelphia County Prison System for extended periods of time. \n24. It was the policy and practice ofDefendants City ofPhiladelphia, Philadelphia Traffic Court, \nKelly and Perri to release from custody individuals with the financial means to pay a portion ofthe \noutstanding fines and costs that accrued in connection with alleged Motor Vehicle Code violations. \nIndividuals, such as members of the Plaintiff Class who are indigent and thus unable to make a \nsubstantial monetary payment, are required to serve prison sentences. \n25.  The practice ofDefendants City ofPhiladelphia, Philadelphia Traffic Court, Kelly and Perri \nrequiring  indigent  persons  to  post  substantial  amounts  of money  or  remain  incarcerated \n6\n \n\nCase 2:03-cv-01400-TJS   Document 1   Filed 03/04/03   Page 7 of 18\nimpermissibly treats a class of persons - the indigent - differently than others similarly situated. \n26.  Defendants  Kelly  and  Perri,  in  their  respective  capacities  as  President Judge  and \nAdministrative Judge of Philadelphia Traffic Court, and as final policy and decision makers for \nDefendants City of Philadelphia and Philadelphia Traffic Court, knew or should have known that \nthe named Plaintiff and the Plaintiff Class were being subjected to the above-described treatment \nby officials and employees of the Philadelphia Traffic Court and failed to take steps to ensure that \nin cases where individuals were subject to periods of incarceration the accused were provided: \na.  the assistance of counsel; \nb.  notice of the specific charges against them; \nc.  the opportunity to prepare a defense; \nd.  the opportunity to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against them; \ne.  the opportunity to offer evidence on their own behalf; and \nf.  equal protection of the law. \n27. The arrests, prosecutions and incarcerations ofthe named Plaintiffand the PlaintiffClass were \nundertaken by all Defendants pursuant to a pattern, practice and policy ofunlawfully arresting and \nprosecuting individuals on alleged Motor Vehicle Code violations without the rights to counsel, due \nprocess and equal protection of the law. \n28.  As a direct and proximate cause of all Defendants' illegal and unconstitutional actions, the \nnamed Plaintiff and the Plaintiff Class suffered and will suffer pain, fear, anxiety, embarrassment, \nloss of liberty,  emotional trauma,  financial  losses,  the  loss of the  enjoyment of life, and the \ndeprivation of other liberty and property interests. \n7\n \n\nCase 2:03-cv-01400-TJS   Document 1   Filed 03/04/03   Page 8 of 18\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS OF PLAINTIFF EBONY DAVIS\n \n29.  On or about September 30, 2002, Plaintiff Davis was arrested by Defendant Doe(s) and \ncharged with the failure to pay alleged Motor Vehicle Code violations which totaled in excess of \n$7,500.00 in fines and costs.  Defendant Doe(s) failed to consider available information which \ndemonstrated that Plaintiff Davis was not the individual who had committed the alleged traffic \nviolations. \n30.  Plaintiff Davis repeatedly told Defendant Doe(s) that he was not the individual who had \ncommitted the alleged Motor Vehicle Code violations and produced identification which confirmed \nthat fact.  Defendant Doe(s) knew or should have known that PlaintiffDavis' name, date ofbirth, \nsocial security number and other descriptive information differed from that ofthe person who was \nalleged to have committed the Motor Vehicle Code violations. \n31.  Defendant Doe(s) knew or should have known that there was no probable cause to arrest \nPlaintiff Davis for the alleged Motor Vehicle Code violations as there was no reasonable basis for \nthe belief that Plaintiff Davis  was the individual  who had accrued the traffic tickets  and the \nassociated fines and costs. \n32.  Plaintiff Davis did not commit the alleged Motor Vehicle Code violations or commit any \noffenses against the laws ofthe United States, the Commonwealth ofPennsylvaniaand theCounty \nof Philadelphia that justified the actions of Defendant Doe(s). \n33.  Defendant Doe(s) detained Plaintiff Davis and, without cause or justification, placed him \nunder arrest,  searched him and secured him in handcuffs.  Plaintiff Davis was transported to \nPhiladelphia Traffic Court where he was further detained.  Plaintiff Davis appeared before the \nHonorable  Robert  Shaffer on numerous  violations of the Pennsylvania Motor Vehicle  Code, \n8\n \n\nCase 2:03-cv-01400-TJS   Document 1   Filed 03/04/03   Page 9 of 18\nsummary offenses punishable under Pennsylvania law  by  a maximum period of ninety  days \nincarceration and a $300 fine, as set forth in Offense Tracking Number 20561194. \n34.  Although each of the offenses with which Plaintiff Davis was charged carried a maximum \nperiodofninetydays incarceration,the total number ofoutstandingMotorVehicleCode violations \ncarried a potential consecutive prison sentence in excess of six months. \n35. At the proceeding before Judge Shaffer, PlaintiffDavis, who was indigent and unable to afford \nprivate counsel,was not advised ofhisright tocounselnor providedwiththe assistance ofcounsel. \n36. At the proceeding before Judge Shaffer, PlaintiffDavis was not afforded notice ofthe specific \ncharges against him, the opportunity to prepare a defense,  to confront and cross-examine the \nwitnesses against him or to present evidence on his own behalf. \n37. Despite PlaintiffDavis' protest that he was not the individual who had accrued fines and costs \nin connection with alleged Motor Vehicle Code violations, Judge Shaffer sentenced PlaintiffDavis \nto a period oftwenty-six days incarceration. \n38.  Judge Shaffer further ordered Plaintiff Davis held in the custody of the Philadelphia County \nPrison System until October 25, 2002 or until the amount of $1,748.00 was paid. \n39. As PlaintiffDavis was financially unable to pay the $1,748.00, he was held in the Philadelphia \nCounty Prison System until October 25,2002. \n40.  It is the policy and practice ofDefendants City of Philadelphia, Philadelphia Traffic Court, \nKelly and Perri to release from custody individuals with the financial means to pay a portion ofthe \noutstanding fines and costs that accrued in connection with alleged Motor Vehicle Code violations. \nIndividuals, such as PlaintiffDavis, who are indigent and thus unable to make substantial monetary \npayments, are required to serve prison sentences. \n9\n \n\nCase 2:03-cv-01400-TJS   Document 1   Filed 03/04/03   Page 10 of 18\n41. Upon information and belief, prior to October 25, 2002, employees and officials of the \nPhiladelphiaTraffic Court determinedorshouldhavedeterminedthatPlaintiffDavis wasinfactnot \nthe individual who was alleged to have violated the Pennsylvania Motor Vehicle Code.  No effort \nwas made by Defendants to secure PlaintiffDavis' release from custody prior to October 25,2002. \n42.  On October 25, 2002, Plaintiff Davis was transported from the Philadelphia County Prison \nto Philadelphia Traffic Court where a representative of the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office \nand court-appointed counsel were present. At that time, PlaintiffDavis, having been determined not \nto be the individual wanted for Motor Vehicle Code violations, was ordered released from custody. \nThis order thus invalidated the judgment and sentence ofJudge Shaffer dated September 30, 2002. \nMr. Davis had served twenty-six days in prison. \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nINJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF FOR CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS \nThe Named Plaintiff and the Plaintiff Class v, Defendants \n43. Plaintiffs hereby reallege paragraphs 1-42 ofthis Complaint, as though fully set forth herein. \n44.
