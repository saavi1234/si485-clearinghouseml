    "summary": "<p>On June 25, 1999, several individuals, representing all individuals who were previously receiving benefits under one or more of Food Stamps, Medicaid, or Food Assistance, but whose benefits have been terminated and were denied fair hearings, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  The plaintiffs, represented by a number of public interest firms, brought the suit against the New York Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, the New York Department of Health, and the New York Department of Labor.  Plaintiffs contend that defendants systematically fail to provide recipients with fair hearings that comply with the requirements set forth in (i) federal and state statutory law; and (ii) the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p><p>Defendants moved to dismiss the case under FCRP Rule 12(b)(6). The District Court, held that: (1) recipients were not required to exhaust state court appeals of decisions; (2) Eleventh Amendment barred claims based on state law, but did not bar federal claims; (3) recipients could maintain suit under § 1983 for violations of fair hearing provisions of Food Stamp Act and Medicaid Aid; (4) the court was not required to abstain from deciding case under Younger or Burford abstention doctrines; and (5) recipients stated a claim that administrative law judges violated their rights to fair hearing by not assessing the adequacy of affidavits from state agencies attesting to notice procedures followed when benefits were withdrawn. The motion was granted in part and denied in part: plaintiffs' claims were dismissed to the extent that they arose under New York State law, but in all other respects, defendants' motion to dismiss was denied.</p><p>Following the judgment on the motion to dismiss, the parties agreed to a settlement. The terms of the agreement included (1) class certification; (2) training, coding, and sampling by the plaintiffs' counsel for 18 months; (3) individual relief allowing the named plaintiffs to reopen their hearings; and (4) the dismissal of the action.</p>",

    "summary_short": "This class action was filed against the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance in 1999, challenging the failure of that agency to provide due process to appellants in administrative fair hearings. The defendants filed 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. The motion was granted for the claims that arose under New York State Law, but was denied in all other respects. This case settled in February 2005, awarding significant injunctive relief to the platiniffs.",

Kevin Castel from Vincent Leong\ndated 4/13/04 re: dfts request with plaintiffs' counsel consent, permission to submit a\n\nmemorandum of law in support of dft's motion for summary judgment (currently due\n4/14/04); the parties are directed to appear before me on 4/19/04 @11:00 a.m. There\nappears to be fundamental misunderstanding of the forthcoming motion. Prior to and\nat our last conference 2/27/04, plaintiffs expressed a desire to refile their summary\njudgment motion and dfts expressed a desire to refile their summary judgment\nmotion. We recessed to permit the parties to confer privately. thereafter, it was agreed\nthat I would set a trial date of 9/7/04.that the summary judgment motions would not\nbe refiled at that defendants would present their legal defenses by way of motion...\nspecifically, I recall Mr. Leong referring to an 11th argument, Mr. Leong?s letter of\n4/13/04 appears to proceed from the premise that none of the foregoing transpired on\n2/27. His requests is denied. (Signed by Judge P. Kevin Castel on 4/14/04) (pl, )\nModified on 4/19/2004 (pl, ). (Entered: 04/19/2004)\n04/19/2004 83  ENDORSED LETTER addressed to Judge P.

(es, )\n(Entered: 03/24/2005)\n03/25/2005 125  MEMORANDUM AND ORDER UPON CONSIDERATION...Defendants'\nwell−intentioned memorandum reinforces my conclusion that there are problems\nwith the proposed Settlement as drafted. Defendants concede that the preclusive\neffect of a judgment as to a future−eligible class member \"who came to participate in\na fair hearing with a mailing issue at some date in the future following the expiration\nof the Settlement may have been less than artfully expressed.\" (Def. Mem. at 7)\n(em−phasis in original) The proposed Settlement refers to the class dissolving after\n\"the expira−tion of the term of this Stipulation,\" but the proposed Settlement itself\nhas no date of expi−ration, and, as I read Paragraph III(B) of the Proposed\nSettlement, class members \"forever discharge\" their released claims. At a minimum,\nthis is confusing. Defendants propose a modification that they say remedies the\nproblem. In their view, the proposed revision makes it clear that only future eligible\npersons who file claims for public assistance before the period of time that the\ndefendants complete their implementation will be barred, and only during the period\nof implementation which is expected to continue into 2007. I have reviewed the\nproposed language and conclude that it does not reconcile the \"forever discharge\"\nrequirement with the purported \"expiration of the term of this Stipulation.\" More\nimportantly, the proposed modification does not address the adequacy of\nrepresentation (as well as the intermeshed typicality and commonal−ity issues, see\nMarch 8, 2005 Mem. and Order n.1) and due process concerns. Defendants argue that\nthe Settlement, in its modified form, presents only a slight burden on future eligible\npersons because they would not be forever barred from bringing equitable and\ndeclaratory claims but only barred until the defendants implement training and\nmonitoring measures. These measures are expected to be complete by early 2007.\nDefendants concede that their concern is that future eligible persons will come\nforward during the period of implementation and seek other or different relief. The\nfact that the defendants' concern is bona fide validates the proposition that the future\neligible persons would be forced to give up a valuable right. Defendants' concern\nabout exposure to claims by future−eligible persons does not trump Rule 23(a) and\nthe notice requirements of due process. Defendants would be fully capable of arguing\nin subsequent litigation that further injunctive and declaratory relief would be\nunwarranted, given the substantial steps they will be undertaking to remedy their own\nprocedures through enhanced training and monitoring. Defendants cite Joel A. v.\nGiuliani, 218 F.3d 132 (2d Cir. 2000), considered by this Court but not cited in the\nMemorandum and Order of March 8. The objections before the Court in Joel A. were\nnot those asserted on behalf of future eligible persons, but rather, were asserted on\nbehalf of \"alleged victims of bias−related violence, harassment and discrimination at\nthe hands of their heterosexual peers in the foster care system and by the City and\nState officials responsible for overseeing the child welfare system.\" Id. at 137. As the\nCourt's opinion notes, \"[t]he Joel A. objectors asserted in the district court and claim\nhere that they could not be adequately represented within the Marisol subclass three,\nsince the class consists of the very peers who have been victimizing them, and that\nthe dis−trict court took insufficient steps to ensure that they were adequately\nrepresented in settlement discussions.\" Id. at 138. Joel A. arose in the context of a\nsettlement approval and the Court expressly declined to revisit issues of class\ncertification. Id. at 143. The Court af−firmed the district court's finding of fairness of\na settlement that precluded individuals from bringing claims during a finite period\n\nduring which compliance was implemented. Id. at 142. In the case before me, it is not\nthe substantive fairness of the settlement that warrants concern, but Rule 23 and due\nprocess as applied to persons to whom notice is not possible.The motion is denied. I\nwill take up remaining matters at a conference scheduled for March 28, 2005 at 10:00\na.m. (Signed by Judge P.

Cf. Beaudoin, \n45 N.Y.2d at 347, 408 N.Y.S.2d 417, 380 N.E.2d \n246. As stated previously, the hearing officers whose \nconduct is challenged in this action are State officers, \nand the City's procedures, such as those for mailing \nNotices or presenting evidence at the fair hearings, \nare not directly challenged by plaintiffs. Rather, the \nState defendants' alleged policies in conducting the \nfair  hearings  and  accepting  the  City's  evidence \nprovide  the  bases  for  plaintiffs'  causes  of  action. \nFinally, the Court notes that the City is free to file a \nmotion to intervene if it so chooses. \n \nDefendants' motion to dismiss for failure to join a \nnecessary party is therefore denied. \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nFor the reasons stated, defendants' motion to dismiss \nis GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. Plaintiffs' \nclaims are dismissed to the extent that they arise \nunder New York State law. In all other respects, \ndefendants' motion to dismiss is DENIED. \n \n ",

Moreover,  defendants  attempt to \nassert the privilege as to documents generated by a \nthird party (i.e. the HRA), as opposed to intra-agency \ndocuments as required by relevant case law.FN2See, \ne.g., In re Franklin Nat'l Bank Securities Litig., 478 \nF.Supp. 577, 580-81 (E .D.N.Y.1979); cf.

The Court also notes that defendants \nhave failed to submit a proper privilege log \nbecause  the  log  fails  to  indicate  which \nprivilege  purportedly  applies  to  which \ndocument. \n \nTherefore,  defendants  shall  disclose  each  of  the \ndocuments to plaintiffs. However, defendants may \nredact the documents to avoid disclosure of material \nthat  would  not  qualify  for  disclosure  under  the \nprevious guidelines set forth by this Court, or which \nis  not  otherwise  discoverable  under  Rule  26(b). \nHowever,  defendants  shall  not  redact  information \nrelated to procedures used at fair hearings, decisions \nissued by administrative law judges (ALJs), possible \nproblems associated with the hearing process, or the \nreceipt (or non-receipt) of mail by benefit recipients. \nAny  discussion of the instant action contained in \nthese documents may be excluded under the work \nproduct doctrine. \n \n*4 SO ORDERED. \n \nS.D.N.Y.,2000. \nMeachem v.

In  the  event  such  an  amended  complaint  conforming  to \nthe  requirements  of  Section  IV.F.l  hereof  is served and  filed \nduring  the  Reinstatement  Window,  the  action  shall  proceed on  the \namended  complaint,  subject  to  such pleading,  motion,  discovery \nand  trial schedule  as  the  Court  may  determine,  consistent  with \nthe  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure.  In proceedings  had  upon \nthe  amended  complaint,  rulings  of  law made  prior to  reinstatement \nof  the action  shall  serve  as  law  of  the  case  to  such  extent  as \nthe  Court  may  determine  these  prior rulings  of  law  remain \napplic~ble to  and  controlling of  questions  of  law  that  arise  in \nthe  course  of  litigation of  the  claim(s)  set  forth  in  the  amended \ncomplaint. \n3.  Counsel  for  the  parties  stipulate  that  in  the  event \nthe  action  is  reinstated by  the  service  and  filing  of  an  amended \n13 \n\ncomplaint  pursuant  to  Section  IV.F.l  hereof,  alleged violations \nof  rights  at  Fair Hearings  of  Class  Members  that  occurred or  are \nalleged  to  have  occurred prior to  the  First  Sampling  Period shall \nnot  form  a  basis  for  any  relief  (declaratory,  injunctive  or \notherwise)  in the  reinstated action,  and  counsel  representing  the \nplaintiffs or any  certified plaintiff class  in  the  reinstated \naction shall  not  be  permitted to  introduce,  or otherwise  rely \nupon,  any  evidence of  alleged deficiencies  in the  conduct  of  Fair \nHearings  of  Class  Members  with  respect  to  fair hearings  that  were \nconducted prior to  the  First  Sampling  Period,  to  support  any \nclaim seeking  declaratory,  injunctive or other relief  in such \nreinstated action. \nIV.

Hanks  SUBJECT:  Fair Hearing Training \nIt is  the  intention  of the  Office  of Administrative  Hearings  to  continue  to  provide  CLE \naccredited training to its hearing officers to reinforce the Office of Administrative Hearings' objective to \nprovide the best possible hearings for the parties before us.  We have begun training on and continue to \ndevelop a training module dealing with, among other items, proof of mailing and related issues.  The \ncurriculum for that on-going training will include the following general principles: \n•  Defining the issue for review \nAt the beginning of a hearing, the hearing officer should confirm and clarify the hearing issue \nrequested by the appellant. \n•  Introduction of documents at the hearing \nAs documents are being offered as  evidence at a hearing, the hearing officer should clearly \nidentify them for the record and indicate on the record that each party has a copy or is being shown a \ncopy of the documents presented. \nA collection 0 f documents, such as an evidence packet, should be separately identified to the \nextent practicable.  Each document in a collection should be described by the hearing officer and then \nmarked separately for identification.  After a document has been offered as evidence, the hearing officer \nshould indicate on the \"green sheet,\" as well as the on the record whether a document is or is not being \naccepted into evidence.  If the hearing officer does not accept a document into evidence, he/she should \nexplain the reason on the record.  If the hearing officer chooses not to accept into evidence a document \nmarked for identification, the hearing officer should explain the reason on the record but the document \nwill nonetheless be made part of the fair hearing record.  In what is anticipated to be rare instances, if a \nparty offers into evidence voluminous documents that are clearly completely irrelevant to the issue or \nissues of the hearing, the hearing officer has the discretion not to mark the documents into evidence nor \nplace them in  the fair  hearing  file  but  should  describe  the  documents  and  explain  why  they are \nirrelevant. \nIn addition to checking that both s ides either have the document, or have been shown it, the \nhearing officer should give the party being presented with the document an opportunity to review it and \nask any questions with regard to the document. \n•  Mailing affidavits \nIn cases where affidavits are offered to establish the local agency's procedures with respect to \nmailing a document, the hearing officer should evaluate whether the affidavit is appropriate for the type \n\nof docwnent mailed, and determine whether the presumption of mailing the document was established \nin  the  appellant's  case.  To  that end,  the  evidence presented should correspond with  the  process \ndescribed in the affidavit.  The hearing officer should also  evaluate whether the agency has the \nappellant's correct address in its records, and , if not, whether the appellant ever properly and timely \nnotified the agency ofthe hislher correct address. \nIn sum, the hearing officer should examine and consider all the documents and other evidence in \nthe record in order to determine whether or not the· mailing procedure alleged in the affidavit(s ) was \nused for the mailing in question.  . \n•  Developing the hearing record \nThe hearing officer's duties include the responsibility to elicit evidence, if necessary, particularly \nwhere the appellant demonstrates difficulty or inability to question a witness (See 18 NYCRR §358-\n5.6(b)(3), but not to the extent of acting as an appellant's representative. \nThe recording equipment should be on during the entire hearing.  If there is any conversation \nbetween the hearing officer and the parties, or between the parties before the recording equipment is \ntorned on, the hearing officer should summarize the conversations on the record.  If the hearing officer \nturns off the recording equipment during the hearing, he or she should state on the record the reason. \nWhen the recording equipment is turned back on, the hearing officer should ask the parties if there was \nany conversation while the equipment was off and, if so, what was said. \nIf the appellant alleges non-receipt of a mailed docwnent, the hearing officer should explain to \nboth parties that the agency will first be asked to provide evidence that establishes the document was \nproperly mailed and, if mailing is established, the appellant will have a full and fair opportunity to \nexplain why the document at issue was not received.  The hearing officer may find  an appellant's \n.uncorroborated testimony as sufficient to  rebut the agency's claim that the appellant was mailed a \n··notice.  If the appellant identifies a docwnent which appears to the hearing officer can corroborate the \nappellant's testimony on a material issue, the hearing officer should ask the appellant whether he or she \nwould like an adjournment for that purpose and, if so, an adjournment should be granted.  The hearing \nofficer may issue subpoenas or take other action, pursuant to  18 NYCRR 358-5.6(b)(8), to  compel \nproduction of either witnesses or documents. \n•  Fair Hearing Decisions \nWhen a decision adverse to the appellant turns on the credibility of the appellant, the basis for \nthe determination should be included in the decision.  Please note that the lack of documentary evidence \nis  not  a  per se basis  for  finding  an appellant's  testimony incredible.  A  hearing officer may find \nuncorroborated testimony to be credible, especially where it is found to be uncontradicted or internally \nconsistent. \nI appreciate the warm reception our CLE-accredited training has received from hearing officers \nand the interest expressed in on-going training.  We are continuing to develop and update our curricula \nand welcome your recommendations for additional topics of concern.
