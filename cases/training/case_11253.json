GIULIANI, in his official capacity as Mayor of the City of New \nYork, Howard Safir, in his official capacity as Police Commissioner of \nthe City of New York, and The City of New York, Defendants. \nNo. 97 Civ. 6748(VM). \nUnited States District Court, S.D. New York. \nJuly 13, 2004. \nDaniel J. Leffell, Douglas Lasdon, New York City, for Plaintiffs. \nAlbert Fredericks, Paul A. Crotty, Corporation Counsel for the City of NY, New York City, for \nDefendants. \nDECISION AND ORDER \nMARRERO, District Judge. \nIn this attorney's fees application, the Court must determine a reasonable fee for a plaintiff \nwhose broad civil rights class action complaint ultimately resulted in only modest, individual \nsuccess. In September 1996, the Manhattan law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and \nGarrison, LLP (\"Paul Weiss\") began researching the prospect of challenging New York \nCity's (the \"City\") policy of arresting homeless persons sleeping in public spaces. Paul \nWeiss eventually found two plaintiffs who had been arrested in a February 331*331 1997 \npark sweep and, in September 1997, filed a class action complaint on their behalf against \nthe City, then-mayor Rudolph Giuliani (\"Giuliani\"), and then-Police Commissioner Howard \nSafir (collectively the \"Defendants\"). The complaint sought to invalidate the City ordinance \nunder which the plaintiffs were arrested, and it sought class-wide damages for all those \nsimilarly situated. After compiling close to $1 million in fees and expenses, the lawsuit's only \nsuccess has been that one plaintiff, Augustine Betancourt (\"Betancourt\"), obtained a \n$15,000 settlement for having been unlawfully strip searched. The lawsuit (thus far) has \nfailed to overturn the challenged ordinance, or to even have a class certified. For these \nreasons, and those set forth more fully below, the Court considers reasonable an award of \n$55,976.19. \n[1]\nI. BACKGROUND  \nIn July 1996, the New York City Police Department (\"NYPD\") issued a guide listing thirty-\nfive law enforcement tools for its officers to implement the Giuliani administration's \"Quality \nof Life Initiative,\" which, among other things, sought to remove the homeless from public \n\nspaces. The guide included Section 16-122 of the New York City Administrative Code, \nwhich states in relevant part: \nIt shall be unlawful for any person, such person's agent or employee to leave, or to suffer or \npermit to be left, any box, barrel, bale of merchandise or other moveable property whether \nor not owned by such person, upon any marginal or public street or any public place, or to \nerect or cause to be erected thereon any shed, building or other obstruction. \nN.Y.C. Admin. Code § 16-122(b) (2000). \nOn February 27, 1997, Betancourt, a homeless man, entered Collect Pond park in lower \nManhattan and fell asleep on a park bench inside a tube he had fashioned from cardboard \nboxes. That evening, the NYPD arrested Betancourt and approximately twenty-six other \nindividuals in the park, many of whom were also homeless. Betancourt was subjected to a \nstrip search while in custody and he was not released until the morning of March 1. His \npapers indicated he was arrested for violating Section 16-122, but the New York County \nAssistant District Attorney ultimately declined to prosecute the case. \nIn September 1997, Betancourt and another individual arrested in the park sweep, Lambert \nWatson,[2] filed the class action complaint in this action, signed by pro bono counsel Paul \nWeiss and the Urban Justice Center. Paul Weiss had been contemplating such a lawsuit at \nleast as early as September 1996, long before the Park sweep. The complaint alleges, in \nshort, that, under the Quality of Life Initiative, the City had applied Section 16-122 as a \nbroad anti-vagrancy statute which unlawfully punished New Yorkers for merely existing in \npublic with some of their personal belongings. Among the 17 causes of action are (1) that \nSection 16-122 is vague and overbroad as applied to the sweep victims; (2) that the sweep \nvictims were arrested without probable cause and subjected to unreasonable strip searches \nand property seizures; and (3) that the City's selective enforcement violated the 332*332 \nEqual Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. \nIn an oral ruling in May 1997, Judge Sprizzo (then the District Judge assigned) denied \nBetancourt's motion to preliminarily enjoin City officials from arresting persons under \nSection 16-122. After extensive discovery and briefing on cross motions for summary \njudgment, Judge Martin (to whom the case was later re-assigned), granted Betancourt \nsummary judgment on the unlawful strip search claim, but granted Defendants summary \njudgment as to every other claim. See Betancourt v. Giuliani, No. 97 Civ. 6748, 2000 WL \n1877071 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 26, 2000). Judge Martin also denied Betancourt's motion for class \ncertification. See id. at *7. \nOn the strip search claim, the Court determined that the alleged violation of law for which \nBetancourt was arrested, which carried a maximum sentence of ten days' imprisonment, did \nnot justify a strip search, absent any suspicion that Betancourt was concealing weapons or \nother contraband. See id. Betancourt appealed Judge Martin's order, but the Second \nCircuit, sua sponte, determined that it lacked jurisdiction because the order was not a final \njudgment. See Betancourt v. Giuliani, 30 Fed.Appx. 11, 2002 WL 226408 (2d Cir.2002). \nAfter the dismissal, the parties settled the strip search claim — the only claim standing in \nthe way of appellate jurisdiction — for $15,000 and this Court entered final judgment in \n\nFebruary 2004. Betancourt appealed the merits of Judge Martin's order again, and that \ncase is pending before the Second Circuit (Docket No. 04-0926). \nNow before the Court is Betancourt's motion for attorneys' fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. § \n1988. The Court must determine a reasonable award in light of the limited success of the \nlawsuit so far. \nII. DISCUSSION \nThe Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Award Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. § 1988, governs this motion \nand states, in relevant part: \"In any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of section [ ] \n... 1983[,] the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party ... a reasonable \nattorney's fee as part of the costs....\" It is undisputed that Betancourt is a prevailing party \nwithin the meaning of § 1988, leaving only the question of what amount is reasonable. \nThe Supreme Court has stated that the \"most useful starting point for determining the \namount of a reasonable fee is the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation \nmultiplied by a reasonable hourly rate,\" a figure commonly called the \"loadstar.\" Hensley v. \nEckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983). The district court then \nmay adjust the loadstar based upon a number of factors,[3] the \"most critical\" of which \"is the \ndegree of success obtained.\" See id. at 436, 103 S.Ct. 1933. As the Supreme Court held: \n\"The result is what matters.\" Id. at 435, 103 S.Ct. 1933.[4] \n333*333 Betancourt acknowledges that the lawsuit has been only a partial success so far. \nHe proposes that the Court first excise the fees pertaining to the failed appeal and then, to \naccount for the limited success, reduce the remaining fees by eighty percent, for a total \naward of approximately $156,000. Although Defendants do not propose an alternative \nreasonable fee award, it is clear they would have the Court award a much lower figure. \nDefendants suggest that, even before making an across-the-board reduction to account for \nthe lawsuit's limited success, the Court should excise a large portions of the bills which they \ncontend do not pertain to the successful strip search claim. Defendants also claim Paul \nWeiss's hourly rates are too high, and that certain costs and expenses should be \neliminated. \nA. HOURLY RATE \nThe Court first turns to the appropriate hourly rate to apply to Betancourt's application. On \naverage, Paul Weiss's attorneys \"charged\" — it bears recalling that they initiated the \nlitigation as pro bono counsel — a rate of about $300 per hour, corresponding to the rates \nat which Paul Weiss would normally charge its corporate clients for the services of the \nassociate attorneys assigned to this case.[5] Defendants persuasively argue that those rates \nfar exceed the typical rates at which a civil rights attorney would actually charge a paying \nclient. As a judge in this District stated, \"there is force in [Defendants'] argument that [they] \nshould not be required to pay for legal services at the rate [a corporate law firm] would \ncharge to, say, General Motors or IBM (should they be among its clients), but should be \nrequired to compensate plaintiff only for what would have been charged by a competent \nattorney specializing in civil rights litigation.\" Pastre v. Weber, 800 F.Supp. 1120, 1125 \n\n(S.D.N.Y.1991). Just as the \"negotiation and payment of fees by sophisticated clients are \nsolid evidence of their reasonableness in the market,\" see Gucci Am., Inc. v. Duty Free \nApparel, Ltd., 315 F.Supp.2d 511, 524 (S.D.N.Y.2004) (quoting Bleecker Charles Co. v. 350 \nBleecker Street Apartment Corp., 212 F.Supp.2d 226, 230 (S.D.N.Y.2002)), the fact that the \nfees here were not actually charged by Paul Weiss to any client suggests that the Court \nmust take a closer look as to whether the hourly rates are reasonable. Moreover, the Court \nechoes the observation in Pastre that Paul Weiss \"derive [s] value from undertaking \nlitigation such as this which may indeed far exceed anything [the Court] can award,\" such \nas training to younger associates and the recruitment value of a strong pro bono practice. \nSee Pastre, 800 F.Supp. at 1125. In light of the above analysis, the Court concludes that \nthe average hourly rate should be reduced to $200 per hour. See Knoeffler v. Town of \nMamakating, 126 F.Supp.2d 305, 312 (S.D.N.Y.2000) (awarding a civil rights lawyer with \nseven years' experience $200 per hour and collecting supporting cases). \nB. REDUCTION FOR LIMITED SUCCESS \nTurning to the actual billing entries, the Court notes initially that the Supreme Court has \nexplicitly approved both general approaches which the parties propose: \"The district court \nmay attempt to identify specific hours that should be eliminated\" (Defendants' suggestion), \n\"or it may simply reduce the award to account for the limited success\" (Betancourt's \nsuggestion). See Hensley, 461 U.S. at 436-37, 103 S.Ct. 334*334 1933; see also Green v. \nTorres, 361 F.3d 96, 99 (2d Cir.2004). The Court adopts the latter approach and will apply \nan across-the-board reduction of ninety percent. \nDefendants' proposal, which the Court rejects, is that the Court excise certain portions of \nthe bills altogether because, according to Defendants, those bills clearly pertain to issues \nother than the strip search claim. The Court is not convinced that it is advisable, much less \npossible, to make such a sharp demarcation, especially considering that the billing record, \nwhich is approaching its eight-year anniversary, is so extensive. See New York State Ass'n \nfor Retarded Children, Inc. v. Carey, 711 F.2d 1136, 1146 (2d Cir.1983) (\"[I]t is unrealistic to \nexpect a trial judge to evaluate and rule on every entry in an application.\"); cf. Hensley, 461 \nU.S. at 437, 103 S.Ct. 1933 (\"A request for attorney's fees should not result in a second \nmajor litigation.\"). For example, Defendants suggest that the hours pertaining to certain \ndepositions, including Betancourt's own deposition, should be eliminated from consideration \nbecause the topics discussed did not involve the strip search claim. It would be a tall order \nfor the Court to review all the depositions to try to confirm this assertion, or to otherwise \nattempt to apportion the depositions' text as between the successful and unsuccessful \nclaims. By way of further example, Defendants suggest that the Court should eliminate all \nthe bills predating the complaint. Again, however, Betancourt's attorneys must have spend \nsome amount of time researching and drafting the portion of the complaint pertaining to the \nsuccessful strip search claim. The Court's review of the billing entries makes it clear that it \nwould be impossible discern that precise amount of time. \nMoreover, the Court emphasizes that Defendants' proposed technical review would unlikely \nproduce a more accurate figure. As explained above, even if the Court were to eliminate \ncertain clearly unrecoverable billing entries (e.g.,\"research class cert. brief\"), the vast \nmajority of the billing entries would remain, and, as to those entries, the Court would \nnecessarily have to venture into the inexact science of applying an across-the-board \n\npercentage reduction to account for Betancourt's limited success. The imprecision inherent \nin that calculation would render trivial the more technical points Defendants press here. To \nbe sure, the Court has not ignored altogether Defendants' points in this regard. Defendants' \narguments serve to underscore the more basic point, which the Court addresses next, that \nmost of the effort in this litigation, and the bulk of the bills Paul Weiss compiled, pertained to \nits unsuccessful (so far) attempt to invalidate Section 16-122. \nFinally, the Court is mindful that in civil rights litigation there is frequently an overlap of \nefforts relating to successful claims and to claims that ultimately fail. No surgical standards \nexist by which to neatly and minutely isolate and sever elements of legal services devoted \nto this division of claims. In fact, courts recognize that the pursuit of successful causes of \naction often entails and is inexorably intermingled with claims that do not prevail insofar as \nthe claims involve a common core of facts or are based on related legal theories. See \nGonzalez v. Bratton, 147 F.Supp.2d 180, 212 (S.D.N.Y.2001) (citing Reed v. A.W. \nLawrence & Co., 95 F.3d 1170, 1183 (2d Cir.1996)). \nTurning now to the appropriate percentage reduction, the Court must discern the measure \nof Betancourt's success, which by all accounts is relatively minimal. In simple terms, \nBetancourt's complaint attempted to initiate an impact litigation against the Giuliani \nadministration, but to date has achieved virtually no success in 335*335 that regard. The \nCourt has not invalidated Section 16-122, nor certified a class on the issue, nor has \nBetancourt demonstrated that the City has changed its policies in any way as a direct \nconsequence of this lawsuit.[6] The City agreed only to do something which it no doubt does \nin many of the hundreds of ordinary tort cases it faces each year: to write a check to \ncompensate the victim of an official's unlawful conduct. \nMoreover, the Court notes that the strip search claim involved settled law and essentially \nuncontested facts. The claim comprised only five sentences and a single case citation in \nBetancourt's summary judgment briefing. Although Defendants denied the strip search \nclaim in their answer, they did not devote a single sentence in their summary judgment \nbriefing to opposing Betancourt's motion for summary judgment on the strip search claim. In \nother words, Defendants essentially conceded the issue.[7] \nIn light of the simplicity of the issue, the Court concludes that Paul Weiss must have spent a \nnominal amount of time on the strip search claim, as compared to the much more complex, \nunsuccessful claims. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the fees requested should be \nreduced by ninety percent, instead of the eighty percent which Betancourt suggests. \nC. EXPENSES AND COSTS \n\"[A]wards of attorney's fees in civil rights suits under fee-shifting statutes ... normally include \nthose reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the attorney and which are normally \ncharged fee-paying clients.\" Reichman v. Bonsignore, Brignati & Mazzotta P.C., 818 F.2d \n278, 282 (2d Cir.1987). All of the expenses in Betancourt's application are those which are \ntypically charged to fee-paying clients and, hence, are recoverable. See, e.g., Gucci Am., \n315 F.Supp.2d at 526 (awarding expenses for electronic research); Sea Spray Holdings, \nLtd. v. Pali Fin. Group, Inc., 277 F.Supp.2d 323, 325 (S.D.N.Y.2003) (awarding fees for \nnon-legal support); Wilder v. Bernstein, 975 F.Supp. 276, 287 (S.D.N.Y.1997) (awarding \n\nexpenses for transportation costs); Cool v. Police Dep't of City of Yonkers, 620 F.Supp. \n954, 957 (S.D.N.Y.1985) (awarding expenses for overtime and duplicating). \nDefendants challenge the connection of these costs to the strip search claim. Again, \nhowever, the Court will not venture to discern, for example, which photocopies pertain to \nwhich of the claims in this lawsuit. Instead, to address Defendants' more fundamental point, \nthe Court will apply the same ninety percent reduction to Betancourt's requests for costs \nand expenses. This large reduction is also intended to subsume any of Defendants' claims \nthat the costs charged were excessive. \n336*336 D. CALCULATION OF AWARD \nIn accordance with the above discussion, the Court makes the § 1988 award as set forth in \nthe chart below. \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----- \nATTORNEYS\n                                      \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----- \nHours Bills                                                            2520.8  \nA \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----- \nHours Spent on Dismissed Appeal                                         259.8  \nB \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----- \n                                          Subtotal of Hours (A-B)        2261  \nC \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----- \nHourly Rate                                                              $200  \nD \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----- \n                                                      Total (C×D)  $  452,200  \nE \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----- \nNON-LEGAL SUPPORT\n                                   \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----- \nHours Billed                                                             \n435.3  F \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----- \nHours Spent on Dismissed Appeal                                           \n89.1  G \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----- \n                                          Subtotal of Hours (F-G)        \n346.2  H \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----- \nAvg.

ORDER \nFor the reasons stated, it is hereby \nORDERED that the motion of plaintiff Augustine Betancourt (\"Betancourt\") for attorney's \nfees and costs under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 is granted and defendant the City of New York is \nfound liable to Betancourt in the amount of $55,976.19. \nThe Clerk of Court is directed to enter judgment accordingly and to close this case. \n\nSO ORDERED. \n[1] The factual summary derives from the Declaration of Eric Twiste in Support of Plaintiff Bentacourt's Application for \nan Award to Counsel of Attorney's Fees, Expenses, and Related Costs, dated March 2, 2004, and the Declaration of \nAve Maria Brennan in Response to Plaintiff's Application for Fees and Costs, dated April 30, 2004, as well as the \nexhibits attached to those documents. The Court will not cite these sources further. \n[2] Watson was dismissed from the case because he has disappeared. \n[3] In adjusting the loadstar, courts generally consider the following twelve factors set forth in Johnson v. Georgia \nHighway Express, Inc., 488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir.1974): \"(1) the time and labor required; (2) the novelty and difficulty of \nthe questions; (3) the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly; (4) the preclusion of employment by the \nattorney due to acceptance of the case; (5) the customary fee; (6) whether the fee is fixed or contingent; (7) time \nlimitations imposed by the client or the circumstances; (8) the amount involved and the results obtained; (9) the \nexperience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys; (10) the `undesirability' of the case; (11) the nature and length of \nthe professional relationship with the client; and (12) awards in similar cases.\" See Hensley, 461 U.S. at 430 n. 3, 103 \nS.Ct. 1933 (citing Johnson, 488 F.2d at 717-19). \n[4] Betancourt, as the fee applicant, \"bears the burden of establishing entitlement to an award and documenting \nappropriate hours expended and hourly rates.\" Id. at 437, 103 S.Ct. 1933. \n[5] The billing records indicate that only a negligible amount of the billing pertains to partners, as opposed to \nassociates. \n[6] In a separate lawsuit, the City paid a substantial settlement to victims of its unconstitutional blanket policy of strip \nsearching persons arrested for minor offenses. See Benjamin Weiser, New York Will Pay $50 Million In 50,000 Illegal \nStrip-Searches, N.Y. Times, Jan. 10, 2001, at A1 (referring to Tyson v. City of New York, No. 97 Civ. 3762 (filed May \n22, 1997)). Judge Martin declined to certify a class in this lawsuit because one had already been certified in Tyson. \nSee Betancourt, 2000 WL 1877071, at *7 (\"As to the strip-search claim, a class action has already been certified and \nthere is no need for another one.\"). \n[7] The Court does not intend to suggest that Betancourt's award should be reduced by the mere fact that his claim \nwas straightforward. See DiFilippo v. Morizio, 759 F.2d 231, 235 (2d Cir.1985) (\"[T]he fact that a case is \nstraightforward is not grounds to reduce a lodestar award.\"). Instead, the Court takes this fact as evidence towards \nmaking a proper apportionment of the fee as between the successful and unsuccessful claims. \n ",

Betancourt alleged that subsection (b) of that section, which, inter\nalia, prohibits leaving boxes and erecting obstructions in public spaces, is unconstitutionally overbroad and, as\napplied to him, unconstitutionally vague; he also alleged that his arrest was without probable cause and violated\nhis right to travel. The district court, John S. Martin, Jr., then-Judge, granted defendants' motion for partial\nsummary judgment dismissing those claims on the grounds that § 16-122(b) was sufficiently clear to give notice\nboth to Betancourt and to law enforcement officials as to what conduct was prohibited; that the section plainly\napplied to Betancourt's observed conduct; and that the section did not implicate Betancourt's right to travel. On\nappeal, Betancourt principally pursues his contentions that § 16-122(b) is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad\nand that he was arrested without probable cause. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\nI. BACKGROUND\nThis case arises out of the 1997 arrest of Betancourt and other homeless persons pursuant to a City program\ndesigned to improve the quality of life in the City's public spaces. Viewed in the light most favorable to\nBetancourt, as the party against whom summary judgment was granted on the claims at issue on this appeal, the\nfollowing facts are not in dispute except as indicated.\nA. The Events\nIn 1994, the City undertook a \"Quality of Life\" initiative designed to reduce a wide range of street crimes including\nprostitution, panhandling, and drug sales. Betancourt asserted that the initiative was thereafter expanded to, inter\n\nalia, reduce the number of homeless persons residing in public spaces. The City's Police Department issued a\nguide for law enforcement officers, listing laws that prohibited conduct targeted by the initiative. Those laws\nincluded City Administrative Code § 16-122, subsection (b) of which states that\n[i]t shall be unlawful for any person, such person's agent or employee to leave, or to suffer or\npermit to be left, any box, barrel, bale of merchandise or other movable property whether or not\nowned by such person, upon any marginal or public street or any public place, or to erect or cause\nto be erected thereon any shed, building or other obstruction.\nN.Y., N.Y., Admin. Code (\"NYC Admin. Code\") § 16-122(b).\nIn the early morning hours of February 28, 1997, in or around certain parks in lower Manhattan, police officers\narrested 25 individuals, including Betancourt. Betancourt had come to the park at approximately 10:30 p.m. on\nFebruary 27 with some personal possessions, three folded cardboard boxes, and a loose piece of cardboard. He\n550 used the three boxes to construct *550 a \"tube\" large enough to accommodate most of his body; he placed the\ntube on a park bench, climbed into the tube, covered the exposed part of his body with the loose piece of\ncardboard, and went to sleep. At approximately 1:00 a.m. on February 28, the police roused Betancourt from his\nsleep and arrested him. At approximately 5:00 a.m. on March 1, 1997, Betancourt was given a Desk Appearance\nTicket, noting that he was charged with violating § 16-122, and was released. By that time, the District Attorney's\nOffice had signed a \"DECLINATION OF PROSECUTION,\" stating that \"PROSECUTION OF TH[E] CASE\n[against Betancourt] WAS DECLINED [because the case] Lack[ed] Prosecutorial Merit.\" (Declination of\nProsecution dated February 28, 1997.)\nB. The Present Action\nThe present action was commenced in September 1997 under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 by Betancourt and by another\nplaintiff who has not pursued his claims. Betancourt alleged principally (a) that § 16-122(b) is unconstitutionally\noverbroad and unconstitutionally vague as applied to him, (b) that he had been arrested without probable cause\nand in violation of his right to travel, and (c) that he had been subjected to an unreasonable strip search.\nFollowing a period of discovery, both sides moved for summary judgment.\nAs to the vagueness challenge, defendants contended that § 16-122(b) was clear on its face. Betancourt\ndisputed that contention, pointing out that subsection (a) of § 16-122 states that \"[t]he purpose of this section is to\npunish those persons who abandon and/or remove component parts of motor vehicles in public streets,\" NYC\nAdmin. Code § 16-122(a). He argued that § 16-122 as a whole did not provide him with reasonable notice that his\nconduct, which was unrelated to motor vehicles, would be unlawful.\nIn a Memorandum Opinion and Order dated December 26, 2000, the district court granted Betancourt's motion\nfor summary judgment as to liability on his strip-search claim00a claim that was eventually settled and is not at\n97\nissue on this appeal. As to Betancourt's remaining claims, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of\ndefendants. See Betancourt v. Giuliani, No. 97 Civ. 6748, 2000 WL 1877071, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Dec.26, 2000) (\n\"Betancourt I\").\nIn addressing Betancourt's vagueness challenge, the district court stated that a statute is not unconstitutionally\nvague if it (1) \"give[s] the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited,\"\nand (2) \"provide[s] explicit standards for those who apply [it].\" Id. at *3 (internal quotation marks omitted). The\ncourt also noted that \"`[b]ecause the statute is judged on an as applied basis, one whose conduct is clearly\nproscribed by the statute cannot successfully challenge it for vagueness.'\" Id. (quoting United States v. Nadi, 996\nF.2d 548, 550 (2d Cir.1993)).\nThe district court found the plain language of § 16-122(b) sufficiently clear to alert Betancourt that his conduct\nwas prohibited. The court stated that the language that \"makes it unlawful to erect or cause to be erected . . . any\nshed, building or other obstruction,\" Betancourt I, 2000 WL 1877071, at *3 (internal quotation marks omitted),\nwas reasonably understood to apply to Betancourt's conduct because he\n\nhad erected a human-sized cardboard structure, housing a human inside, in a public space. He\nwas not simply occupying a park bench with a few personal items. Rather, he had erected an\nobstruction in a public space.\n551 *551 . . . . Because Plaintiff had sufficient notice that his conduct was prohibited by Section 16-122\n(b), the statute passes the first prong of the vague as applied test,\nid. at *4.\nThe district court rejected Betancourt's argument that subsection (b) implicitly included subsection (a)'s reference\nto motor vehicles. The court noted that the predecessor to § 16-122(b) had referred to, inter alia, erecting\nobstructions and leaving boxes and \"vehicle[s]\" on \"public street[s],\" NYC Admin. Code § 755(4)-2.0 (1964).\nSection § 755(4)-2.0 was substantially revised in 1969 and was eventually codified as § 16-122. Subsections (a),\n(c), (e), and (f) of § 16-122 were drafted to deal explicitly with motor vehicles; the language of § 755(4)-2.0\nbecame subsection (b) of § 16-122 but was amended to remove any reference to vehicles. However, the court\nnoted,\nthe prohibition against leaving boxes, barrels, bales of merchandise, and erecting sheds or\nobstructions in public spaces remained in subsection (b). While subsection (a) explained the\npurpose of the new subsections regarding motor vehicles, no such explanation was needed to\nexplain the purpose of the prohibition against leaving other things in public spaces. Moreover, the\nplain meaning of subsection (b), which unlike the other subsections contains no reference to\nvehicles, requires that it be read as prohibiting leaving boxes and erecting obstructions in public\nspaces.\nBetancourt I, 2000 WL 1877071, at *3 (emphases added).\nThe district court also found that § 16-122(b) did not give law enforcement agents unfettered discretion to make\narrests, but instead provided adequate guidelines to permit them to determine whether a person was engaging in\nconduct that violated that subsection. Distinguishing City of Chicago v. Morales, 527 U.S. 41, 119 S.Ct. 1849, 144\nL.Ed.2d 67 (1999), in which the Supreme Court had found unconstitutionally vague a city ordinance that simply\nprohibited gang members from \"loitering\" in public spaces, without providing guidance as to what constituted\nloitering, the district court stated that\nthe ordinance at issue in this case offers law enforcement personnel guidance in the form of a list\nof specific objects, including boxes, that should not be left in public spaces.\nSimilarly, there is less uncertainty involved in a police determination of what constitutes an\nobstruction of a public space than in a police determination of what constitutes loitering in a public\nspace. The fact that the police must exercise some discretion in the application of Section 16-122\n(b) does not render the regulation void. . . . The text of Section 16-122(b) provides sufficient\nguidelines to limit police discretion in its application, and therefore it is not void in its application to\nPlaintiff's conduct. Plaintiff's constitutional challenge to Section 16-122(b) therefore fails.\nBetancourt I, 2000 WL 1877071, at *4-*5 (emphasis added).\nFollowing the decision in Betancourt I, Betancourt attempted an immediate appeal. However, as his strip-search\nclaim had not yet been fully resolved, this Court dismissed the appeal sua sponte for lack of appellate jurisdiction.\nSee Betancourt v. Giuliani, 30 Fed.Appx. 11, 12-13 (2d Cir. 2002). After the strip-search claim was settled in 2004\nby the City's agreement to pay Betancourt $15,000, a final judgment was entered, and this appeal followed.\nII. DISCUSSION\n552 On appeal, Betancourt principally pursues his claim that § 16-122(b) is unconstitutionally *552 vague as applied\nto him, arguing that \"[t]he district court properly recognized . . . that Section 16-122(b) required at least a `fairly\nstringent' standard of vagueness, because the section imposes criminal penalties and does not have any intent\n\nrequirement,\" but that the court \"should have . . . applied a stricter, `especially stringent' standard of vagueness,\nbecause Section 16-122(b) also implicates the fundamental right to travel.\" (Betancourt brief on appeal at 21-22.)\nBetancourt also argues that § 16-122(b) is overbroad and that the police did not have probable cause to arrest\nhim. For the reasons that follow, we find no basis for reversal.\nA. The Vagueness Claim\nThe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that laws be crafted with sufficient clarity to\n\"give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited\" and to \"provide\nexplicit standards for those who apply them.\" Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33\nL.Ed.2d 222 (1972); see, e.g., Smith v. Goguen, 415 U.S. 566, 572-73, 94 S.Ct. 1242, 39 L.Ed.2d 605 (1974)\n(\"the due process doctrine of vagueness\" \"incorporates notions of fair notice or warning\" and \"requires\nlegislatures to set reasonably clear guidelines for law enforcement officials and triers of fact in order to prevent\n`arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement'\"). Thus,\n[a]s generally stated, the void-for-vagueness doctrine requires that a penal statute define the\ncriminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is\nprohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. \nHoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., [455 U.S. 489, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 71 L.Ed.2d 362\n(1982)]; Smith v. Goguen, 415 U.S. 566, 94 S.Ct. 1242, 39 L.Ed.2d 605 (1974); Grayned v. City of\nRockford, 408 U.S. 104, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972); Papachristou v. City of\nJacksonville, 405 U.S. 156, 92 S.Ct. 839, 31 L.Ed.2d 110 (1972); Connally v. General\nConstruction Co., 269 U.S. 385, 46 S.Ct. 126, 70 L.Ed. 322 (1926). Although the doctrine focuses\nboth on actual notice to citizens and arbitrary enforcement, . . . the more important aspect of the\nvagueness doctrine \"is not actual notice, but the other principal element of the doctrine00the\n97\nrequirement that a legislature establish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement.\" Smith, 415\nU.S., at 574, 94 S.Ct. 1242. Where the legislature fails to provide such minimal guidelines, a\ncriminal statute may permit \"a standardless sweep [that] allows policemen, prosecutors, and juries\nto pursue their personal predilections.\" Id., at 575, 94 S.Ct. 1242.\nKolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 357-58, 103 S.Ct. 1855, 75 L.Ed.2d 903 (1983).\nRegulations need not, however, achieve \"meticulous specificity,\" which would come at the cost of \"flexibility and\nreasonable breadth.\" Grayned, 408 U.S. at 110, 92 S.Ct. 2294 (internal quotation marks omitted). \"The degree of\nvagueness that the Constitution tolerates00as well as the relative importance of fair notice and fair\n97\nenforcement00depends in part on the nature of the enactment.\" Village of Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman\n97\nEstates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 498, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 71 L.Ed.2d 362 (1982). For example, \"economic regulation is\nsubject to a less strict vagueness test\" than is legislation regulating noncommercial conduct. Id. On the other\nhand, a greater degree of precision is required for enactments that provide for \"criminal penalties because the\n553 consequences of imprecision are qualitatively\" *553 more severe. Id. at 498-99, 102 S.Ct. 1186. \"[P]erhaps the\nmost important factor affecting the clarity that the Constitution demands of a law is whether it threatens to inhibit\nthe exercise of constitutionally protected rights.\" Id. at 499, 102 S.Ct. 1186. If it does pose such a threat, \"a more\nstringent vagueness test should apply.\" Id.\nIn the present case, § 16-122(b) is a criminal statute, and thus is subject to more than a minimal level of scrutiny.\nBut as applied in the present case it does not impinge on constitutionally protected rights. Betancourt does not\ncontend that his construction of a cardboard enclosure in which he could sleep, with some protection from the\ncold, was intended to be expressive activity protected by the First Amendment. Nor does § 16-122(b) impinge on\nBetancourt's other constitutionally protected rights, for, despite his contention to the contrary, it does not impair\nhis right to travel, given that it does not restrict interstate or intrastate \"freedom of movement,\" Kolender, 461 U.S.\nat 358, 103 S.Ct. 1855. Thus, only a moderately stringent vagueness test was required for a determination of\nwhether § 16-122(b) was impermissibly vague as applied to Betancourt. The district court properly recognized\nthis standard, and we see no basis for reversal in its application of the standard to the language of § 16-122(b)\nthat prohibits the erection of an obstruction.\n\nWe pause to note our disagreement with the district court's ruling to the extent that it determined that the first of §\n16-122(b)'s prohibitions, i.e., \"leav[ing], or . . . permit[ting] to be left, any box [etc.],\" provided guidance to officers\nin their arrest of Betancourt, on the premise that that segment made clear that \"boxes . . . should not be left in\npublic spaces,\" Betancourt I, 2000 WL 1877071, at *4 (emphasis added). That part of § 16-122(b) was not\napplicable to Betancourt. He did not \"leave\" his box behind; he remained inside it.\nNonetheless, the second § 16-122(b) prohibition forbids a person to \"erect [in any public place] . . . any shed,\nbuilding or other obstruction,\" and those words have plain dictionary meanings that applied to the conduct of\nBetancourt. For example, Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1976) (\"Webster's Third\") gives one\ndefinition of the verb to \"erect\" as to \"put up (as a building or machine) by the fitting together of materials or\nparts.\" Id. at 770. An ordinary person planning to fashion three boxes into a structure that was sufficiently large\nfor a man to crawl into, and that was designed to give him shelter against the cold, would recognize that he was\nplanning to \"put up\" something \"by the fitting together of materials or parts.\" Webster's Third defines \"obstruction\"\nas \"something that obstructs or impedes,\" and defines \"obstruct\" as to \"block up.\" Id. at 1559. An ordinary person\nwould understand that an agglomeration of boxes large enough for a man to fit into would be \"something that\nobstructs or impedes.\"\nBetancourt points out that sheds and buildings are structures that would normally be of some permanence. See,\ne.g., Webster's Third at 2090 (defining \"shed\" as \"a slight structure (as a penthouse, lean-to, or partially open\nseparate building) built primarily for shelter or storage\"). He also points out that the first § 16-122(b) prohibition,\nforbidding the \"leav[ing]\" of \"any box, barrel, bale of merchandise or other movable property,\" concerns movable\nobjects. He argues that § 16-122(b)'s final prohibition concerning \"other obstruction[s]\" should therefore be\ninterpreted as limited to structures of permanence. We disagree.\n554 An object plainly may \"obstruct[ ] or impede[ ]\" without doing so permanently. *554 Had the lawmakers intended\n\"obstruction\" to mean a permanent edifice, they could have simply added that adjective before \"obstruction.\" We\nthink it clear that § 16-122(b) was meant to forbid any obstruction, whether permanent or temporary.\nIn sum, as § 16-122(b) forbids a person to \"erect\" an \"obstruction\" in a public place, we conclude that the district\ncourt properly ruled that that language was sufficient to alert Betancourt, and to provide adequate guidance to\nlaw enforcement agents, that Betancourt's conduct was prohibited. Accordingly, § 16-122(b) is not\nunconstitutionally vague as applied to Betancourt.\nB. Betancourt's Other Claims\nBetancourt's other claims do not require extended discussion. He claims that § 16-122(b) is \"unconstitutionally\nover-reaching because it prohibits innocent, unoffending conduct that is beyond the state's police power to\nregulate\" (Betancourt brief on appeal at 35), i.e., \"sitting, lying, or sleeping\" by homeless persons \"in parks and\nother public places, where they are not impinging on the rights of others\" (id. at 37). This claim is doubly flawed.\nFirst, the Supreme Court \"ha[s] not recognized an `overbreadth' doctrine outside the limited context of the First\nAmendment.\" United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 95 L.Ed.2d 697 (1987). Because\nBetancourt has not raised a First Amendment challenge and is \"`a person to whom a statute may constitutionally\nbe applied,'\" he \"`will not be heard to challenge that statute on the ground that it may conceivably be applied\nunconstitutionally to others, in other situations not before the Court.'\" Parker v. Levy, 417 U.S. 733, 759, 94 S.Ct.\n2547, 41 L.Ed.2d 439 (1974) (quoting Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 610, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830\n(1973)). Second, § 16-122(b) by its terms prohibits leaving or constructing in public spaces inanimate objects that\nare, inter alia, obstructions. That section does not appear to prohibit the conduct00\"sitting, lying, or\n97\nsleeping\"00described by Betancourt.\n97\nFinally, the district court properly dismissed Betancourt's false arrest claim because the police, having observed\nhim in a cardboard structure large enough to house an adult human being, which he had erected in a public\nspace, had probable cause to arrest him.\n\nCONCLUSION\nWe have considered all of Betancourt's arguments on this appeal and have found in them no basis for reversal.\nThe judgment of the district court is affirmed.\nCALABRESI, Circuit Judge, dissenting.\nThe twilight arrest of Augustine Betancourt, purportedly for \"erect[ing] . . . an obstruction\" in a public park,\npresents a textbook illustration of why vague criminal laws are repugnant to the Due Process Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment. It is, as a result, troubling to me that the majority goes to such lengths to find clarity and\nguidance in a city ordinance that provides little of either. Because I believe the law in question, as applied to\nBetancourt, is unconstitutionally vague, I respectfully dissent.\nFor a criminal law to comport with the Due Process Clause and withstand a void-for-vagueness challenge, it must\nboth \"give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited\" and \"provide\nexplicit standards for those who apply them.\" Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33\n555 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972). As the circumstances of Betancourt's arrest demonstrate, Section 16-122(b) of the New *555\nYork City Administrative Code (hereinafter \"Section 16-122(b)\" or \"subsection (b)\") fails to perform these essential\nfunctions.\nThe constitutional defects arise from the ambiguous text of the law at issue. On its face, Section 16-122(b) is a\nbizarre grab bag of loosely-related and imprecise proscriptions:\nIt shall be unlawful for any person, such person's agent or employee to leave, or to suffer or permit\nto be left, any box, barrel, bale of merchandise or other movable property whether or not owned\nby such person, upon any marginal or public street or any public place, or to erect or cause to be\nerected thereon any shed, building or other obstruction.\nN.Y.C. Admin. Code § 16-122(b). The majority opinion admits that most of these restrictions are inapplicable to\nBetancourt. Thus, the majority explicitly disavows the district court's conclusion that Betancourt's conduct was\nsubject to Section 16-122(b)'s prohibition against leaving boxes or other movable property in a public place. See\nMajority Opinion, at *553 (finding that Betancourt \"did not `leave' his box behind; he remained inside it\").\nMoreover, the majority does not at any point suggest that Betancourt erected a shed or a building. Left only with\nthe language barring individuals from \"erect[ing] . . . [some] other obstruction,\" the majority nonetheless insists\nthat the law is not vague as applied to Betancourt, whose offending conduct was seemingly to lie down on a park\n[**]\nbench encircled in a cardboard tube made of two boxes tucked into one another.\nThe first test for constitutional vagueness is whether \"a penal statute define[s] the criminal offense with sufficient\ndefiniteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited.\" Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352,\n357, 103 S.Ct. 1855, 75 L.Ed.2d 903 (1983). As to this, I simply cannot see how one could divine, even after\ncarefully studying the full text of Section 16-122(b), that sleeping on a park bench covered with cardboard is any\nmore unlawful under the ordinance than doing so covered with blankets (which is plainly not illegal under the law\nat hand). Moreover, the specific words that the majority emphasizes 00 \"to erect\" and \"obstruction\" 00 do not, with\n97 97\nor without the aid of published definitions from Webster's Third New International Dictionary, provide meaningful\n556 notice to the ordinary citizen of what is enjoined. See Colautti v.*556Franklin, 439 U.S. 379, 390, 99 S.Ct. 675,\n58 L.Ed.2d 596 (\"It is settled that, as a matter of due process, a criminal statute that fails to give a person of\nordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden by the statute . . . is void for\nvagueness.\"). Could anyone reasonably believe that \"to erect\" refers, as the majority would have it, to all acts of\n\"fitting together of materials or parts\"? See Majority Opinion, at *553. Such a sweeping construction would\nencompass everything from stitching two blankets together to stuffing one winter jacket into another, or00for that\n97\nmatter00to lacing a silk scarf under the collar of a fur coat on an unusually cold winter day. And, if these activities\n97\ndo not fall within the meaning of \"to erect,\" on what possible basis could a person know that putting one\n[***]\ncardboard box into another would be unlawful? See United States v. Harriss, 347 U.S. 612, 617, 74 S.Ct. 808,\n\n98 L.Ed. 989 (1954) (\"The underlying principle is that no man shall be held criminally responsible for conduct\nwhich he could not reasonably understand to be proscribed.\").\nPresumably the majority believes that it is only when one erects an \"obstruction\" that the prohibition of Section\n16-122(b) is triggered. But Betancourt's cardboard tube placed on a park bench was no more of an obstruction\nthan his prone body alone. Indeed, had he draped stitched blankets, stuffed jackets, or a warm fur coat over his\nbody before laying down, would Betancourt thereby have created an obstruction? Hardly! Not even the district\ncourt thought that Section 16-122(b) \"penalize[d] people for merely occupying any public place with a few of their\npersonal belongings.\" Betancourt v. Giuliani, No. 97CIV6748 JSM, 2000 WL 1877071, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec.26,\n2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). Nor does the law, according to the lower court, \"authorize the arrest of\nindividuals for hanging around in public places.\" Id. What the law covers in this context then is entirely unclear,\nand how a person of ordinary intelligence is supposed to figure out that Betancourt's actions were forbidden is\nbeyond me.\nBut it is not just the wording of the provision that makes it hard to know what the law prohibits. It is also the\nstatutory context in which the specific ordinance is found. For the meaning of Section 16-122(b) is further\nobfuscated by the fact that the law is buried among a series of provisions that exclusively pertain to abandoned\n557 automobiles. In fact, apart from *557 Section 16-122(b) 00 i.e., subsection (b) 00 all the other subsections of\n97 97\nSection 16-122 either concern the abandonment of vehicles and vehicle parts, or they prescribe the civil and\ncriminal penalties for violating specific provisions of the code:\n§ 16-122. Vehicles and other movable property.\na. Legislative intent. The need for this legislation is indicated by the ever increasing number of\nabandoned cars in the city of New York. The purpose of this section is to punish those persons\nwho abandon and/or remove component parts of motor vehicles in public streets. It is not the\nintent to prohibit or preclude any person in lawful possession of a vehicle from making lawful\nrepairs or removing any component part for the purpose of making such lawful repairs to a motor\nvehicle on a public street.\n* * * * * * *\nc. It shall be unlawful for any person, such person's agent or employee to leave, or suffer or permit\nto be left, any motor vehicle, not otherwise lawfully parked, whether or not owned by such person,\nin any marginal or public street, or any public place. The owner or driver of a disabled vehicle shall\nbe allowed a reasonable time, not exceeding three hours, in which to remove said vehicle.\nd. Any person convicted of a violation of the provisions of subdivision b or c of this section shall be\npunished by a fine of not less than fifty dollars nor more than two hundred fifty dollars,\nimprisonment for not more than ten days, or both.\ne. It shall be unlawful for any person, such person's agent or employee, to abandon, or to suffer or\npermit to be abandoned any motor vehicle, whether or not owned by such person, in any marginal\nor public street, or any public place.\nf. It shall be unlawful for any person to dismantle, or to remove any component part of any motor\nvehicle in any marginal or public street or any public area.\ng. Any person convicted of a violation of the provisions of subdivision e or f of this section shall be\npunished by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars, or imprisonment for not more than one\nyear.\nh. Any person violating the provisions of subdivision b or c of this section shall be liable and\nresponsible for a civil penalty of not less than twenty-five dollars nor more than one hundred\ndollars.\nN.Y.C. Admin. Code § 16-122 (emphasis added).\n\nAccordingly, Betancourt argues to us (as he did before the district court) that the unequivocal statement of\nlegislative intent in subsection (a) demonstrates that subsection (b) was manifestly not meant to apply to his\nconduct, which, after all, had nothing to do with cars or car parts. Betancourt also reasons that, at the very least,\nthe ubiquitous references to abandoned motor vehicles throughout Section 16-122 cloud the purported meaning\nof Section 16-122(b), and make it nearly impossible for someone reasonably to think that Section 16-122(b)\nimplicates conduct involving cardboard boxes.\nWith respect to these arguments, the majority opinion is silent, and the district court's only answer was to comb\nthrough the legislative history of the law, and, on the basis of that history, to conclude that subsection (b) could be\nread separately from the rest of Section 16-122. See Betancourt, 2000 WL 1877071, at *3 (parsing the City\nCouncil's 1969 amendments, and comparing the text of Section 16-122 to its predecessor, Section 755(4)-2.0, to\n558 decide that \"the legislative history of Section 16-122 defeats\" Betancourt's contention that *558 subsection (b),\nwhen read in the context of the full law, is difficult to decipher).\nTo be sure, our court has previously consulted legislative history in determining whether a law is\nunconstitutionally vague. See, e.g., United States v. Rybicki, 354 F.3d 124, 132-34 (2d Cir.2003) (en banc). But,\nin assessing whether a \"person of ordinary intelligence\" would \"know what is prohibited,\" we cannot automatically\nassume that a lay person will, as a general matter, \"perform[ ] the lawyer-like task of statutory interpretation by\nreconciling the text of [ ] separate documents.\" Rybicki, 354 F.3d at 158 (Jacobs, J., dissenting). Nor should we\nanticipate that ordinary citizens will research, and then reconcile, differences between older and newer laws, and,\non that basis, learn what is allowed and what is unlawful. See id. at 160 (Jacobs, J., dissenting) (\"Ordinary people\ncannot be expected to undertake such an analysis [of legislative history]; rare is the lawyer who could do it; and\nno two lawyers could be expected to agree. . . . \").\nTo its credit (and unlike the district court), the majority opinion does not rely on the legislative history of the city\nordinance to justify its view of what a reasonable person would think Section 16-122(b) deems unlawful. As a\nresult, however, the majority's discussion leaves entirely unaddressed a serious source of confusion for ordinary\ncitizens who, invariably and understandably, will read subsection (b) in the context of the rest of Section 16-122,\ntaking account of, inter alia, the overarching aim of the city ordinance and the legislative intent of the provisions\nas announced in the preceding subsection. See Jones v. United States, 527 U.S. 373, 389, 119 S.Ct. 2090, 144\nL.Ed.2d 370 (1999) (\"Statutory language must be read in context and a phrase `gathers meaning from the words\naround it.'\") (quoting Jarecki v. G.D. Searle & Co., 367 U.S. 303, 307, 81 S.Ct. 1579, 6 L.Ed.2d 859 (1961)). In\norder to do this, an individual need not engage in sophisticated legal analysis or historical speculation; he need\nonly read the language of the law as written. And, where the text is so imprecise, and the context so bewildering,\nthat \"men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning,\" Connally v. Gen. Constr. Co., 269 U.S.\n385, 391, 46 S.Ct. 126, 70 L.Ed. 322 (1926), the law must be deemed fatally vague.\nThe failure to give fair notice is only the first of the two reasons why Section 16-122(b) flunks the canonical test\nfor constitutional vagueness. To satisfy due process, the legislature must also, in drafting a criminal law,\n\"establish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement.\" Smith v. Goguen, 415 U.S. 566, 574, 94 S.Ct. 1242, 39\nL.Ed.2d 605 (1974). The majority opinion essentially ignores this constitutional requirement in its analysis. The\nvoid-for-vagueness doctrine calls for a disjunctive analysis. Thus, vagueness may be found either for want of\nnotice or for want of minimal guidelines. See City of Chicago v. Morales, 527 U.S. 41, 56, 119 S.Ct. 1849, 144\nL.Ed.2d 67 (1999) (\"Vagueness may invalidate a criminal law for either of two independent reasons. First, it may\nfail to provide the kind of notice that will enable ordinary people to understand what conduct it prohibits; second, it\nmay authorize and even encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\" (emphasis added)). It is also well-\nsettled that the second requirement is today the more important one. See Kolender, 461 U.S. at 357-58, 103\nS.Ct. 1855 (\"Although the doctrine focuses both on actual notice to citizens and arbitrary enforcement, we have\nrecognized recently that the more important aspect of vagueness doctrine is not actual notice, but the other\n559 principal element of the doctrine 00 the requirement that a legislature establish minimal guidelines to govern law \n97\n*559 enforcement.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); Rybicki, 354 F.3d at 160 (Jacobs, J., dissenting) (\"This\nsecond inquiry is the more important of the two, and is alone sufficient to decide constitutional infirmity.\" (internal\nquotation marks omitted)).\n\nAs a consequence, I believe that the majority leaves a crucial issue unanswered: what standards, if any, does\nSection 16-122(b) provide to guide law enforcement, prosecutors, judges, and juries in deciding what conduct\nviolates a law that prohibits \"erect[ing] . . . [an] obstruction\"? To this question, the district court had given two\nresponses. First, it stated, without authority or argument, that \"there is less uncertainty involved in a police\ndetermination of what constitutes an obstruction of a public space than in a police determination of what\nconstitutes loitering in a public space.\" Betancourt, 2000 WL 1877071, at *5 (referring to the Supreme Court's\ndetermination in Morales that a city ordinance prohibiting loitering in public spaces was fatally vague). I see no\nbasis for the lower court's assertion. It seems to me that less uncertainty in how this law is enforced may only be\nachieved if the discretion of police officers is bounded by guidelines or standards that delineate what qualifies as\na criminal obstruction. Section 16-122(b) contains neither.\nThe district court also said that the ordinance \"offers law enforcement personnel guidance in the form of a list of\nspecific objects, including boxes, that should not be left in public spaces.\" Id. at *4. But this argument was\npremised on the district court's view that Betancourt had been properly arrested in part for leaving boxes in the\npark, a position the majority explicitly rejects. Thus, to the extent that Betancourt was detained for erecting an\nobstruction, the references to boxes and barrels and bales of merchandise in the first half of Section 16-122(b)\nsupply no more guidance to police officers in interpreting what constitutes an obstruction than do the numerous\nreferences to abandoned vehicles in the rest of Section 16-122. Clarity with respect to one part of a criminal\nordinance does not rectify its absence in the rest of the law. And it is the remaining and unclear part of the\nordinance that Betancourt was arrested for violating.\nIronically, the only guidance on how Section 16-122(b) should be applied came from the New York Police\nDepartment itself: in 1994, the NYPD issued a catalog of \"enforcement options\" to effectuate then-Mayor\nRudolph Giuliani's \"Quality of Life\" initiatives. This type of \"guidance\" is anything but comforting. The fact that a\nlaw against leaving boxes, barrels, and \"other movable property\" in a public place, on the one hand, and erecting\na \"shed, building or other obstruction,\" on the other, was listed, by the police department, as an \"enforcement\noption\" to target seemingly unrelated crimes like \"prostitution, drug sales, and aggressive panhandling\" is\nevidence of that very unfettered discretion that causes vague texts to give rise to constitutional problems. Cf. \nMorales, 527 U.S. at 63, 119 S.Ct. 1849 (deciding that the police's \"internal rules limiting . . . enforcement to\ncertain designated areas\" fails to rescue a vague ordinance against loitering). Deriving standards as to how a law\nshould be applied not from the text of the ordinance, as drafted by the legislature, but instead from how the police\ndepartment might use the law to achieve unrelated ends runs contrary to the main reason that vagueness\ndoctrine insists on standards in the first place. See Smith, 415 U.S. at 575, 94 S.Ct. 1242 (\"Statutory language of\nsuch a standardless sweep allows policemen, prosecutors, and juries to pursue their personal predilections.\n560 Legislatures may not so abdicate their responsibilities *560 for setting the standards of the criminal law.\").\nAs written, Section 16-122(b) leaves the initial decision as to whether someone's actions constitute a crime not\nwith our elected legislators, but with everyday police. Why doesn't the law apply to a woman who, having\nwrapped herself in a fur coat and silk scarf, regularly reclines on a park bench to feed the birds? Or to a passing\nsportsman who, while awaiting his tour bus, takes a nap after lashing together his ski boots, skis, and\nsnowboard? Or to the midnight photographer who mounts his camera onto a tripod and waits patiently for the\nperfect picture? Or would it apply in these situations, but only if the city administrators or the police were averse\nto pigeons, snowboarding, or troublesome artists? Cf. Grover Rees III, Cathedrals Without Walls: A View from the\nOutside, 61 Tex. L.Rev. 347, 371-72 (1982) (discussing the effect of \"anti-parakeet sentiment . . . at the Yale\nClub\" on the enforcement of a vague statute); Am. Fed'n of Gov't Employees, AFL-CIO v. Veneman, 284 F.3d\n125, 129 (D.C.Cir.2002) (musing on H.L.A. Hart's hypothetical law 00 \"No vehicle may be taken into the park.\" 00\n97 97\nas applied to strollers and skateboards (citing H.L.A. Hart, The Concept of Law 25 (1961))); Tunick v. Safir, 209\nF.3d 67 (2d Cir.2000) (concerning a photographer whose metier is the taking of pictures of nude bodies in public\nspaces). Section 16-122(b) is an impenetrable law that could be read to allow police officers to apply the\nordinance almost however they want against virtually whomever they choose. And on the night of February 27,\n1997, that is precisely what they did as part of the mayor's \"Quality of Life\" campaign against the homeless. But\nlet me be clear. This case is not about whether the homeless should be allowed to sleep on park benches.\nPerhaps they should. Perhaps they should not. The issue is whether the law that was used to prevent this\nhomeless man from sleeping on a park gave any guidance whatsoever. Because I, as a citizen, would not know\n\nwhat I was prohibited from doing, and because I, as an officer of the law, would have even less of an idea of what\nI was empowered to stop people from doing, I conclude that the ordinance is unconstitutionally vague.\nAccordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n[*] Pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 43(c)(2), Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Police\nCommissioner Raymond W. Kelly are automatically substituted for former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and former\nPolice Commissioner Howard Safir as defendants in this case.\n[**] In a single sentence, the majority opinion also conjectures that Section 16-122(b) does not implicate the right\nto travel or any other constitutionally-protected rights. On this basis, the majority purports to evaluate the law at\nissue under the \"moderately stringent\" vagueness test applicable to criminal statutes, rather than subjecting it to\nthe more stringent test required for laws that threaten fundamental liberties. With this too, I am inclined to\ndisagree. \nAs it was applied in this case, the ordinance in question seems either to jeopardize the right to travel by\nburdening the so-called \"right to remain,\" see, e.g., City of Chicago v. Morales, 527 U.S. 41, 53-54, 119 S.Ct.\n1849, 144 L.Ed.2d 67 (1999) (\"[T]he freedom to loiter for innocent purposes is part of the `liberty' protected by the\nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. . . . Indeed, it is apparent that an individual's decision to \nremain in a public place of his choice is as much a part of his liberty as the freedom of movement inside frontiers\nthat is a part of our heritage.\" (plurality opinion) (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks and citations\nomitted)), or to endanger other constitutional freedoms, see, e.g., Jones v. City of Los Angeles, 444 F.3d 1118,\n1120 (9th Cir.2006) (striking down as a violation of the Eight Amendment's bar against punishing status rather\nthan conduct a city ordinance that states that \"no person shall sit, lie or sleep in or upon any street, sidewalk or\npublic way\"). I need not settle this question however. For, in my view, Section 16-122(b) is undeniably void for\nvagueness under either the \"moderately stringent\" or the \"even more stringent\" standard.\n[***] In describing Betancourt's act of \"erecting\" something, the majority opinion claims that he \"fashion[ed] three\nboxes into a structure. . . . designed to give him shelter against the cold.\" Majority Opinion, at *553 (emphasis\nadded). One of these boxes was literally just placed on its side on one end of the park bench. After sticking the\ntwo other boxes into one another and encasing his torso within the resulting tube of cardboard, Betancourt slid\nhis shoes and feet into the box that was lying by itself. The majority's suggestion that this third box (which simply\nsat sideways on the bench and was physically unconnected from the cardboard tube) was also part of what\nBetancourt had \"erected\" would entail an even looser meaning of the already-vague verb. \nThe majority opinion also selectively ignores part of the very definition it presents. According to the opinion, \"to\nerect\" means to \"put up (as a building or machine) by the fitting together of materials or parts.\" Majority Opinion,\nat *553 (emphasis added). The references to \"a building or machine\" in the dictionary definition, just like the\nstatutory references to \"shed\" and \"building\" in Section 16-122(b), were admittedly meant to be illustrative, not\nexhaustive. Yet, the majority makes no attempt to explain how Betancourt's cardboard tube was tantamount to, or\nof a similar scale as, a building, shed, or machine.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
