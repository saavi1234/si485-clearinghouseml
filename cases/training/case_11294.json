    "summary": "<p>On August 1, 2005, a group of men, who claimed they were wrongfully searched, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs sued the City of Oakland, the Oakland Chief of Police, and Oakland police officers under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, alleged that the defendants violated the plaintiffsโ constitutional rights through a policy and practice of performing strip searches and body-cavity searches in public on only โreasonable suspicionโ that people were hiding something illegal. The plaintiffs sought both injunctive relief and damages. This case was related to eight similar cases pending in the Northern District of California.</p><p>On September 20, 2005, the plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint for class action and individual relief for injuries and violation of their civil rights. On October 6, 2005 the case was reassigned to Judge Marilyn Hall Patel. Discovery proceeded for 18 months. On January 29, 2007, Judge Patel denied the plaintiffsโ motion for class certification. 2007 WL 219796.</p><p>The parties each moved for summary judgment, and the individual defendants sought qualified immunity (immunity from liability for a public official who is performing a discretionary function, as long as the conduct does not violate clearly established constitutional or statutory rights). On March 27, 2008, Judge Patel granted in part the plaintiffsโ motion for partial summary judgment.  Judge Patel issued a declaratory judgment that the Oakland Police Departmentโs (โOPDโ) policies were unconstitutional in certain respects.  Judge Patel denied the plaintiffsโ motion for summary judgment on liability and declaratory relief for the individual searches at issue. The strip-search policy was held unconstitutional because it provided too low a threshold for officers seeking to check for contraband on suspects in public places. The Court held that while reasonable suspicion is adequate to justify a strip search in the context of a detention facility when institutional security is a concern, it is โinsufficient to justify a strip search in the field.โ The police policy was held unconstitutional to the extent that it allowed strip searches of any kind in the field to be performed on less than probable cause. Judge Patel also found that an earlier version of the policy, enacted in 1998, was unconstitutional because it did not require that more invasive body-cavity searches be conducted by medical personnel. 621 F.Supp.2d 779 (N.D. Cal. 2008).</p><p>Litigation continued regarding the plaintiffsโ claims for liability and declaratory relief on the individual searches at issue. The plaintiffs renewed their motion for class certification, but on January 13, 2009, Judge Patel again denied the plaintiffsโ motion for class certification. 2009 WL 88433.</p><p>On December 14, 2009, Judge Patel granted in part an individual plaintiffโs motion for partial summary judgment on his Fourth Amendment claim for the unlawful strip search that a defendant officer conducted on the plaintiff. Judge Patel declined to rule on the issues of qualified immunity and damages because factual disputes needed to be resolved first. 675 F.Supp.2d 992 (N.D. Cal. 2009).</p><p>The officer petitioned the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals for a writ of mandamus ordering the district court to rule on the issue of qualified immunity. On January 13, 2010, the Ninth Circuit denied the defendantโs petition because there were still material questions of fact regarding qualified immunity, and the defendant had not asked the district court to rule on qualified immunity either by filing a motion for summary judgment or at trial. </p><p>On March 3, 2010, Judge Patel found that two of the cases were related to each other (C-08-4255MHP and C-04-4843MHP), but the other claims had been misjoined. Judge Patel gave the plaintiffs in those actions twenty days to drop all but one of the plaintiffs in each of the actions and to file new actions for each of the dropped plaintiffs. On December 1, 2011 the case was reassigned to Judge Susan Illston. Discovery and settlement negotiations proceeded for the next two years. </p><p>On April 18, 2013, the parties agreed to a settlement of injunctive and declaratory relief claims. The City of Oakland through the OPD agreed to institute a new policy concerning strip searches in the field. The OPD was required to capture and retain all complaints about strip searches conducted in the field and all reports of such searches for a period of two years from the entry of the order. Those reports were forwarded to the plaintiffโs counsel every six months, and the court maintained jurisdiction to ensure compliance for the two years. In the absence of any further proceedings, these related matters were fully and finally dismissed with prejudice on April 18, 2015. The case is closed. </p><p></p>",

Plaintiff Darnell Foster\n8\nPlaintiff Foster is an African-American man.  On February 27, 2004, Foster was visiting a\n9\nfriend in Oakland, California.  At that time, he had served all but two months of a five year\n10\nunsupervised probation sentence without incurring any violations.  \n11\nAt around 3 p.m. of that day, Officer Festag and another unknown officer stopped Foster\n12\nT a\nUR rni 13 outside the School Market on Oaklandโs School Street near Pleitner Avenue.  The officers asked\nO o\nf\nCT  Cali 14 Foster for identification, which he showed to them.  The officers also asked whether Foster was on\nC f \nI o probation or parole, which he answered affirmatively.  Officer Festag then handcuffed Foster and\nR t  15\nT c\nS ri\nDI Dist 16 forced him against the back of his patrol vehicle parked in front of the School Market.  Foster was\nTES  ern  17 ordered to spread his legs and Officer Festag searched Fosterโs pockets.  No contraband was found. \nA h\nT rt\nSo Officer Festag then guided Foster into the rear of the patrol vehicle.  The officers ran a warrant\nD  N 18\nE e \nNIT or th 19 check and searched the area for evidence of illegal activity.  The searches revealed no warrants or\nUF\nevidence of wrongdoing.\n20\nFoster was then removed from the patrol vehicle by Officer Festag, who forced Foster over\n21\nthe hood of the vehicle.  Wearing a latex glove retrieved from the vehicleโs trunk, Officer Festag\n22\npulled Fosterโs pants and underwear down to his knees.  Officer Festag proceeded to search around\n23\nFosterโs testicles using his gloved hand.  The officer also spread Fosterโs buttocks and visually\n24\nsearched Fosterโs anus, stating โIโm going to do a butt-crack search, see if you got crack in your\n25\nbutt-crack.โ  Compl. ยถ 5.

Foster refused to work undercover for the officers and\n2\nrepeatedly denied wrongdoing.  The officers then issued Foster a citation for loitering with the intent\n3\nto sell narcotics before releasing him. \n4\nSeveral months later, in May, Foster received a Notice to Appear in criminal court in\n5\nOakland on the citation issued by Officer Festag.  The charge was subsequently dismissed due to the\n6\nabsence of both the officers to substantiate the allegation against Foster.  Foster filed an Internal\n7\nAffairs complaint against Officer Festag in July 2004.  On August 1, 2005 Foster and another\n8\nplaintiff filed a complaint alleging violations his civil rights under 42 U.S.C. section 1983. \n9\n10\nB.

Duarte was placed in the rear of a police vehicle.  The officers then\n22\nperformed a strip and visual body cavity search on Duarteโs friend.  That search also yielded no\n23\ncontraband.  During the searches of the two men, a crowd had begun to gather around the scene,\n24\nincluding some people with whom Duarte was acquainted.  The individuals witnessed the searches\n25\nof both men.\n26\nDuarte was taken to Oakland City Jail and cited after about two hours in custody.

Plaintiff Yancie Young\n4\nPlaintiff Young is an African-American man.  At approximately 11:30 p.m. on September\n5\n30, 2003, Young was pulled over by Officer Bergeron around the 2800 block of West Street in\n6\nOakland.  Officer Bergeron opened Youngโs car door, pulled him out of the car, and handcuffed\n7\nhim.  Officer Bergeron asked Young if he was on probation or parole, which Young denied   Officer\n8\nBergeron insisted that he smelled marijuana in Youngโs car and suggested that Young was\n9\nsmuggling large quantities of the drug.  \n10\nOfficer Bergeron then took Young to the back of a police car.  While facing Young, he\n11\npulled down Youngโs pants and underwear, revealing Youngโs genitalia.  Then Officer Bergeron\n12\nT a\nUR rni 13 shined a flashlight directed at Youngโs genitalia, visually inspecting Young for up to a minute. \nO o\nf\nCT  Cali 14 Officer Bergeron next performed a pat-search of Young, including ordering Young to remove his\nC f \nI o shoes and feeling Youngโs private area through his pants.

Defendants\n24\nDefendant City of Oakland is a municipal corporation, operating the Oakland Police\n25\nDepartment and employing the additional defendants named below.

They have been sued in both their individual\n2\nand official capacities.\n3\n  1. Oakland Police Departmentโs Policy Before 2004.\n4\nThe Oakland Police Departmentโs 1998 policy, entitled โStrip Searches, Visual Body-Cavity\n5\nSearches, and Physical Body-Cavity Searches,โ barred such searches in public, unless there was an\n6\nurgent need to perform the search and no privacy was reasonably available. Pls.โ Am. Mot. for Class\n7\nCertification at 11. According to Captain Israel, who wrote that policy and trained fellow officers in\n8\nenacting it, searching suspects in the โVโ of a car door was acceptable where justified by some\n9\nโurgent need.โ  Israel Dep., Pls.โ Exh. E at 28:11-29:14.  Captain Israel stated that examples of an\n10\nโurgent needโ to perform such searches included the possibilities of the suspect concealing a weapon\n11\nor some contraband that might be ingested or forced into the rectum.  Id. at 30:2-30:10.  The policy\n12\nT a\nUR rni 13 did not require reasonable suspicion or probable cause.  Id. at 31:3-31:9.  There was also no\nO o\nf\nCT  Cali 14 consideration as to the types of charges for which the suspect was being arrested.  Id. at 31:15-31:18.\nC f \nI o 2. Oakland Police Departmentโs Amended Policy.\nR t  15\nT c\nS ri\nDI Dist 16 In 2004, the Oakland Police Department amended its policy on strip and body-cavity\nTES  ern  17 searches.  The amendments came in response to public concerns regarding the Departmentโs practice\nA h\nT rt\nSo of carrying out such searches.  The Department publicly identified a โlong-standing and problematic\nD  N 18\nE e \nNIT or th 19 practice of conducting strip searches in the field.โ  Pls.โ Exh. C at 4.  \nUF\nThe revised policy added requirements for reasonable suspicion that the subject is concealing\n20\na weapon or contraband.  Additionally, the revised policy addressed the subjectโs privacy, stating\n21\nthat strip searches and body-cavity searches โmust be conducted so that the search cannot be easily\n22\nobserved by the public.โ  The policy required that โreasonable efforts must be made to provide as\n23\nmuch privacy as possible given the circumstances.โ Pls.โ Exh. E, Israel Dep. at 80:23-81:9.  \n24\n3. Oakland Police Departmentโs Alleged Practice.\n25\nPlaintiffs allege that there is a widespread practice of public strip and body-cavity searches\n26\nwithin the Oakland Police Department that deviates from the Departmentโs recently revised policy. \n27\n28\n5\n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-MHP   Document42    Filed01/29/07   Page6 of 10\nPlaintiffs claim that this practice occurs without regard to the privacy of subjects being searched. \n1\nSubjects genitalia, buttocks, and/or anuses are exposed, often without any screen from public view. \n2\nThis alleged practice targets racial minoritiesโespecially Hispanic- and African-Americans.  \n3\n4\nII. Procedural History\n5\nPlaintiffs Foster and Duarte filed the present action on August 1, 2005.  Pursuant to\n6\nstipulations, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on September 22, 2005 adding plaintiff Young. \n7\nAdditionally, the following actions were related to this action: (1) Rider v. City of Oakland, No. C\n8\n05-3204 MHP, related on October 6, 2005; (2) Taylor v. City of Oakland, No. C 04-4843 MHP,\n9\nrelated on October 6, 2005; (3) Moore v. City of Oakland, No. C 06-02426 MHP, related on July 12,\n10\n2006.     \n11\nOn behalf of themselves and a group of similarly-situated persons, plaintiffs charge that\n12\nT a\nUR rni 13 defendants have a pattern and practice of public body-cavity searches, violating plaintiffsโ\nO o\nf\nCT  Cali 14 constitutionally guaranteed rights including due process, freedom from unreasonable searches and\nC f \nI o seizures, freedom from excessive use of forces by police officers, equal protection of the laws, and\nR t  15\nT c\nS ri\nDI Dist 16 freedom from interference within their zones of privacy.\nES  n \nT er 17\nA h\nT rt\nSo LEGAL STANDARD\nD  N 18\nE e \nNIT or th 19 A party seeking to certify a class must satisfy the four prerequisites enumerated in Rule\nUF\n23(a), as well as at least one of the requirements of Rule 23(b).  Under Rule 23(a), the party seeking\n20\nclass certification must establish: (1) that the class is so large that joinder of all members is\n21\nimpracticable (i.e., numerosity); (2) that there are one or more questions of law or fact common to\n22\nthe class (i.e., commonality); (3) that the named partiesโ claims are typical of the class (i.e.,\n23\ntypicality); and (4) that the class representatives will fairly and adequately protect the interests of\n24\nother members of the class (i.e., adequacy of representation).  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  In addition to\n25\nsatisfying these prerequisites, parties seeking class certification must show that the action is\n26\nmaintainable under Rule 23(b)(1), (2) or (3).  See Rule 23(b); Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor,\n27\n28\n6\n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-MHP   Document42    Filed01/29/07   Page7 of 10\n521 U.S. 591, 614 (1997).  Rule 23(b)(2) permits class actions for declaratory or injunctive relief\n1\nwhere the party opposing the class โhas acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to\n2\nthe class.โ Rule 23(b)(2). \n3\nThe party seeking class certification bears the burden of establishing that the requirements of\n4\nRules 23(a) and 23(b) have been met.  See Zinser v. Accufix Research Inst., Inc., 253 F.3d 1180,\n5\n1188 (9th Cir.  2001), amended by 273 F.3d 1266 (9th Cir. 2001); Hanon v. Dataproducts Corp., 976\n6\nF.2d 497, 508 (9th Cir. 1992).  However, in adjudicating a motion for class certification, the court\n7\naccepts the allegations in the complaint as true so long as those allegations are sufficiently specific\n8\nto permit an informed assessment as to whether the requirements of Rule 23 have been satisfied. \n9\nSee Blackie v. Barrack, 524 F.2d 891, 901 n.17 (9th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 816 (1976).  \n10\nThe merits of the class membersโ substantive claims are generally irrelevant to this inquiry.  Eisen v.\n11\nCarlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 177โ78 (1974); Moore v. Hughes Helicopters, Inc., 708 F.2d\n12\nT a\nUR rni 13 475, 480 (9th Cir. 1983).\nO o\nf\nCT  Cali 14\nC f \nI o DISCUSSION\nR t  15\nT c\nS ri\nDI Dist 16 Plaintiffs seek certification of three subclasses:  1) individuals subjected to a strip search\nTES  ern  17 and/or visual body-cavity search in public by Oakland Police officers from August 1, 2003 to\nA h\nT rt\nSo present and until this matter is adjudicated; 2) individuals subjected to a physical body-cavity search\nD  N 18\nE e \nNIT or th 19 in public by Oakland Police officers from August 1, 2003 to present and until this matter is\nUF\nadjudicated; 3) individuals, based in part on their race and/or national origin, subjected to a strip\n20\nsearch, visual or physical body-cavity search in public by Oakland Police officers from August 1,\n21\n2003 to the present and until this matter is adjudicated.  They ask the court to certify their claims for\n22\ndamages as well as injunctive relief under Rule 23(b)(1) and 23(b)(2). \n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n7\n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-MHP   Document42    Filed01/29/07   Page8 of 10\nPursuant to Rule 23, the class must be โso numerous that joinder of all members is\n1\nimpracticable.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1).  As a general rule, classes numbering greater than forty-\n2\none individuals satisfy the numerosity requirement.  See 5 James Wm. Moore et al., Mooreโs Federal\n3\nPractice ยง 23.22[1][b] (3d ed. 2004).  Although plaintiffs need not allege the exact number or\n4\nidentity of class members to satisfy the numerosity prerequisite, mere speculation as to the number\n5\nof parties involved is not sufficient to satisfy the numerosity requirement.  See Freedman v.\n6\nLouisiana-Pac. Corp., 922 F. Supp. 377, 398 (D. Or. 1996); 7 Wright, Miller, & Kane, Federal\n7\nPractice and Procedure ยง 1762 (3d ed. 1995).  Here, plaintiffs have identified sixteen potential class\n8\nmembers who were subject to either a public strip search and/or a public body-cavity search.  Nine\n9\nplaintiffs in this case and related cases have filed suit based on the alleged practice of public strip\n10\nand body-cavity searches by the Oakland Police Department; one case has been dismissed.  Seven\n11\nadditional potential class members have been disclosed in the production of Internal Affairs\n12\nT a\nUR rni 13 complaints filed by alleged subjects of public strip searches.  Word Dep. at 8:10โ10: 10.  As\nO o\nf\nCT  Cali 14 defendants note, one of the putative class members, James Taylor, filed suit based on a search that\nC f \nI o occurred on November 13, 2002, one year prior to the dates in the class definition.  According to this\nR t  15\nT c\nS ri\nDI Dist 16 tally, plaintiffs have presented evidence of a sixteen alleged victims that meet the class definition. \nTES  ern  17 They further speculate that more potential class members are likely to be uncovered but provide no\nA h\nT rt\nSo evidence as to how many more class members there may be.  \nD  N 18\nE e \nNIT or th 19 While there is no specific numerical requirement in the text of Rule 23, courts have\nUF\nrepeatedly held that classes of less than twenty members do not satisfy the numerosity requirement. \n20\nSee, e.g., General Tel. Co. of the Northwest, Inc. v.  EEOC, 446 U.S. 318, 330 & n.14 (1980)\n21\n(citing, with approval, cases in which numerosity was not met with as many as forty class members);\n22\nHarik v.  Cal.  Teacherโs Assโn, 326 F.3d 1042, 1052 (9th Cir. 2003) (vacating certification of\n23\nclasses with less than ten members).  Plaintiffs have produced no evidence that the size of the\n24\npotential class is larger than fifteen members.  The text of Rule 23(a)(1) instructs the court to certify\n25\na class only where joinder of all of the potential plaintiffs would be impracticable.  In this case,\n26\njoinder seems viable: all potential plaintiffs are in the same geographic area, and the small number\n27\n28\n8\n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-MHP   Document42    Filed01/29/07   Page9 of 10\nof potential class members suggests that doing so would not be unduly burdensome.  Accordingly,\n1\nthe court finds that plaintiffs have not satisfied the numerosity requirement at this time.  \n2\nTherefore, the court DENIES plaintiffsโ motion for class certification without prejudice to\n3\ntheir filing another such motion at a later time if plaintiffs can present evidence of a sufficiently\n4\nlarge number of potential class members. \n5\n6\nCONCLUSION\n7\nBased upon the foregoing, plaintiffsโ motion to certify a class is DENIED. \n8\n9\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n10\n11\nDated: \n12\nT a\nUR rni 13 _______________________________\nO o\nf\nCT  Cali 14 MUnAitRedIL SYtaNte Hs DAiLsLtr iPctA CToEuLrt Judge\nC f \nI o Northern District of California\nR t  15\nT c\nS ri\nDI Dist 16\nES  n \nT er 17\nA h\nT rt\nSo\nD  N 18\nE e \nh\nNIT or t 19\nUF\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n9\n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-MHP   Document42    Filed01/29/07   Page10 of 10\nENDNOTE\n1\n2 1.

Plaintiff FOSTER had purchased two Black and Mild cigars at the School\n25\nMarket shortly before Defendant Officer FESTAG and one other unknown Oakland Police Officer\n26\nDOE stopped him.  He possessed no contraband and was not engaged in any illegal activity\n27\nwhatsoever.  Defendant Officers stopped Plaintiff FOSTER as he walked out of the School Market\n28\nand asked him for his identification.   Plaintiff FOSTER showed the officer his identification.  The\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR CLASS ACTION AND INDIVIDUAL RELIEF FOR INJURIES AND VIOLATION OF\nCIVIL RIGHTS 3\n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-SI   Document6   Filed09/22/05   Page4 of 18\n1 officers then asked him whether he was on probation or parole.  Plaintiff FOSTER honestly replied\n2 that he was on probation. In fact, Plaintiff FOSTER,  only two months remained of the five year\n3 felony unsupervised probation sentence for possession for sale of marijuana. Plaintiff FOSTER had\n4 served his probation sentence without incurring  a single violation.  Plaintiff FOSTER told Defendant\n5 Officer FESTAG that he had only two months remaining on his probation.\n6 15. Defendant Officer FESTAG handcuffed Plaintiff FOSTER without explanation and\n7 escorted him to the back of his patrol vehicle, which was parked in front of the School Market.\n8 Defendant Officer FESTAG forced Plaintiff FOSTER against the back of the patrol vehicle and\n9 ordered him to spread his legs.  Defendant Officer FESTAG searched Plaintiff FOSTERโs pockets\n10 and found $22.  Defendant Officer FESTAG told Plaintiff FOSTER that the $22 would be\n11 confiscated.  Even though Plaintiff FOSTER had committed no crime and was not involved in any\n12 manner of illegal activity, Defendant Officer FESTAG informed Plaintiff FOSTER that the $22\n13 found in Plaintiff FOSTERโs pocket was proceeds of narcotics sales.  Defendant Officer FESTAG\n14 claimed that Plaintiff FOSTER was engaged in narcotics sales.  He handcuffed Plaintiff FOSTER and\n15 placed him in the rear of the police vehicle.\n16 16. The unknown Officer DOE ran Plaintiff FOSTERโs name for a warrant check.  The\n17 search revealed no warrants for Plaintiff FOSTER.  Defendant Officer FESTAG searched the area\n18 around the market and located no evidence of any illegal activity relating to Plaintiff FOSTER.  In\n19 spite of the circumstances, which overwhelmingly indicated that Plaintiff FOSTER had not\n20 committed any crime, Defendant Officer FESTAG maliciously told Plaintiff FOSTER that he was\n21 going to violate his probation.  Defendant Officer FESTAG told Plaintiff FOSTER, โI think youโre\n22 holding out on me,โ even though there was no basis to believe that Plaintiff FOSTER was engaged in\n23 illegal activity.\n24 17. Defendant Officer FESTAG removed Plaintiff FOSTER, still handcuffed, from the\n25 back of the patrol vehicle and bent him over the hood of the police car. Defendant Officer FESTAG\n26 opened the patrol vehicleโs trunk and put on a purple latex glove.   He then returned to Plaintiff\n27 FOSTER and ordered him to bend over the hood of the patrol vehicle. Plaintiff FOSTER stood in the\n28 gutter, between the sidewalk and the police car, handcuffed, while Defendant Officer FESTAG\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR CLASS ACTION AND INDIVIDUAL RELIEF FOR INJURIES AND VIOLATION OF\nCIVIL RIGHTS 4\n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-SI   Document6   Filed09/22/05   Page5 of 18\n1 yanked Plaintiff FOSTERโs gray sweat pants down to his knees.  Defendant Officer FESTAG then\n2 yanked Plaintiff FOSTERโs boxer shorts down to his knees, exposing Plaintiff FOSTERโs genitalia.\n3 Humiliated and stunned, Plaintiff FOSTER felt Defendant Officer FESTAGโs hands reach under his\n4 testicles.  Consistent with Plaintiff FOSTERโs  innocence, this offensive sexual battery showed that\n5 Plaintiff FOSTER possessed no contraband at all.\n6 18.  To Plaintiffโs shock and disbelief, Defendant Officer FESTAG told Plaintiff FOSTER\n7 โIโm going to do a butt-crack search, see if you got crack in your butt-crack.โ  Plaintiff FOSTER was\n8 forced to comply with Defendant Officer FESTAGโs outrageous conduct.  Defendant Officer\n9 FESTAG spread Plaintiff FOSTERโs butt-cheeks with his right hand and exposed the anus.  The\n10 unknown Officer DOE was also present, and both officers inspected Plaintiff FOSTERโs anus.\n11 Predictably, this unwarranted intrusive search failed to reveal any contraband.\n12 19. Defendant Officers pulled Plaintiffโs underwear and sweat pants up and put him back\n13 in the rear of the patrol vehicle.  Despite the complete lack of evidence, Defendant Officer FESTAG\n14 told Plaintiff that he was going to take him to jail for โloitering with the intent to sell narcotics.โ\n15 Plaintiff FOSTER denied loitering and told the officers that he had just gone to the store, and was not\n16 involved in any drug activity.\n17 20. Defendant Officer FESTAG drove about two blocks away and stopped the patrol\n18 vehicle near the corner of Texas and Maple Streets.  One of the Defendant Officers asked Plaintiff\n19 FOSTER if he knew anyone who sold marijuana. When Plaintiff FOSTER said โno,โ the officers\n20 asked him to make an undercover drug purchase.   After Plaintiff FOSTER refused to become a\n21 snitch for the officers, Defendant Officer FESTAG told Plaintiff FOSTER โHelp me so I can help\n22 you.โ\n23 21. Plaintiff FOSTER again asked the officers what he had done, and they again claimed\n24 that he had sold narcotics. When Plaintiff FOSTER truthfully stated that he had not sold narcotics,\n25 the officers insisted that Plaintiff FOSTER sign a citation for violating an Oakland Municipal\n26 Ordinance prohibiting loitering with the intent to sell narcotics.  Plaintiff FOSTER signed the citation\n27 and Defendant Officer released him.  Defendant Officers kept Plaintiff FOSTER handcuffed\n28 throughout the incident, which lasted nearly half an hour.\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR CLASS ACTION AND INDIVIDUAL RELIEF FOR INJURIES AND VIOLATION OF\nCIVIL RIGHTS 5\n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-SI   Document6   Filed09/22/05   Page6 of 18\n1 22. After being released, Plaintiff FOSTER returned to the same store, โSchool Marketโ\n2 and spoke with the store clerk.  The clerk told Plaintiff FOSTER that one of the officers had come in\n3 and asked him how long Plaintiff FOSTER had been in the store.  The clerk stated that he had told\n4 the officer Mr. FOSTER had come into the store just before the police came.\n5 23. Plaintiff FOSTER returned home to Carson City, Nevada.  Several months later, in\n6 May, Plaintiff FOSTER received a Notice to Appear in Criminal court in Oakland in September 2004\n7 on the citation issued by Defendant Officer FESTAG.    Plaintiff FOSTER called the Oakland Police\n8 Department Internal Affairs Division and filed an Internal Affairs complaint against Defendant\n9 Officer FESTAG sometime around July 2004.   In order to defend against the false loitering charges,\n10 Plaintiff FOSTER traveled from Nevada to Oakland and appeared in court in Oakland on September\n11 24, 2004.  The charge against him was dismissed when neither Officer FESTAG, nor any other\n12 officer, appeared in court to substantiate the false allegation against Plaintiff FOSTER.\n13 24. Plaintiff FOSTER alleges, on information and belief, that defendant officers had\n14 insufficient information, and no particularized facts, to support their stop, detention, and search of\n15 Plaintiff.\n16 25. The detention, search, and arrest of Plaintiff FOSTER described herein was done\n17 without any just provocation or cause, proximately causing Plaintiff FOSTERโs injuries and resulting\n18 damages.\n19 26. Plaintiff FOSTER alleges on information and belief that defendant officers performed\n20 the public, intrusive anal-cavity search without probable or reasonable cause pursuant to an official or\n21 de facto CITY OF OAKLAND policy condoning and/or ratifying such illegal searches.  Plaintiff\n22 further alleges he was singled out for this conscience-shocking search at least in part due to his race.\n23 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS REGARDING PLAINTIFF RAFAEL DUARTE\n24 27. On the afternoon of March 9, 2005, Plaintiff RAFAEL DUARTE was a passenger in a\n25 car driven by a friend of his, Deandre Wash. Mr. Wash drove a late-80s model Toyota Supra. Two\n26 all-black Oakland Police vehicles, believed to be โtask-forceโ vehicles, cut the Supra off without\n27 warning, forcing the car  to a sudden stop on Baker Street between, between 62nd and 63rd Street in\n28 Oakland.\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR CLASS ACTION AND INDIVIDUAL RELIEF FOR INJURIES AND VIOLATION OF\nCIVIL RIGHTS 6\n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-SI   Document6   Filed09/22/05   Page7 of 18\n1 28. Although the Officers gave no orders to Plaintiff or Mr. Wash, at least one Defendant\n2 Officer DOE opened the passenger side door and yanked Plaintiff DUARTE from the vehicle.\n3 Although Plaintiff DUARTE had committed no crime, the DOE police officer forced him against the\n4 Toyotaโs hood and handcuffed him.  The DOE police officer then walked Plaintiff DUARTE to the\n5 front-side of a nearby house.   Several other unknown Defendant Officer DOES were also present at\n6 the scene.  The DOE police officer pat-searched Plaintiff DUARTE several times and then searched\n7 him thoroughly.  The search yielded no contraband.\n8 29. Plaintiff DUARTE protested, stating that he had not committed any crime and was not\n9 in possession of any contraband.  Even though the searches performed by  Officer DOE confirmed\n10 that Plaintiff DUARTE had committed no crime and possessed no contraband, one other Defendant\n11 Officer DOE 2 told the first Officer DOE that he thought he had seen Plaintiff DUARTE โstuff\n12 something in his pants.โ\n13 30. Defendant Officers pulled Plaintiff DUARTEโs pants down and ordered him to bend\n14 over.  To Plaintiff DUARTEโs shock and humiliation, one of the Defendant Officer DOES spread\n15 Plaintiff DUARTEโs butt-cheeks exposing his anus.  The search proved fruitless.  Plaintiff DUARTE\n16 possessed no contraband anywhere.\n17 31. Plaintiff DUARTE was placed in the rear of the police vehicle.  Defendant Officers\n18 then removed Plaintiffโs friend, Mr. Wash, from the vehicle and performed the same type of anal-\n19 cavity search on Mr. Wash.  That search also yielded no contraband whatsoever.  A crowd of people\n20 had gathered during the search, and Plaintiff DUARTE was acquainted with some of the people who\n21 witnessed the outrageous anal-cavity search of Plaintiff and his friend, Mr. Wash.\n22 32. Plaintiff DUARTE was transported to Oakland City Jail where he was cited out after\n23 about two hours in custody. Plaintiff DUARTE told the officer who took his fingerprints about the\n24 anal-cavity search and was told by the officer to file an Internal Affairs complaint.  He was also told\n25 that his civil rights had been violated and that he should file a lawsuit.  No charges were ever filed\n26 against Plaintiff DUARTE.\n27\n28\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR CLASS ACTION AND INDIVIDUAL RELIEF FOR INJURIES AND VIOLATION OF\nCIVIL RIGHTS 7\n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-SI   Document6   Filed09/22/05   Page8 of 18\n1 33.  Plaintiff DUARTE alleges, on information and belief, that defendant officers had\n2 insufficient information, and no particularized facts, to support their stop, detention, and search of\n3 Plaintiff.\n4 34. The detention, search, and arrest of Plaintiff DUARTE described herein was done\n5 without any just provocation or cause, proximately causing Plaintiff DUARTEโs injuries and\n6 resulting damages.\n7 35. Plaintiff DUARTE alleges on information and belief that defendant officers performed\n8 the public, intrusive anal-cavity search without probable or reasonable cause pursuant to an official or\n9 de facto CITY OF OAKLAND policy condoning and/or ratifying such illegal searches.  Plaintiff\n10 further alleges he was singled out for this conscience-shocking search at least in part due to his race.\n11 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS REGARDING PLAINTIFF YANCIE YOUNG\n12 36. On September 30, 2003, at approximately 11:30 p.m., Defendant BERGERON made a\n13 traffic stop of Plaintiff YOUNG at approximately the 2800 block of West Street in the City of\n14 Oakland.  This traffic stop was without probable cause or other legal justification.\n15 37. Defendant BERGERON opened Plaintiffโs door, pulled Plaintiff YOUNG out of his\n16 car, and handcuffed him.  This arrest was without probable cause or other legal justification.\n17 38. Defendant BERGERON asked Plaintiff YOUNG if Plaintiff was on probation or\n18 parole, which Plaintiff denied.  Defendant BERGERON told Plaintiff YOUNG that he โsmelled\n19 marijuanaโ in Plaintiffโs car and accused Plaintiff YOUNG of โsmuggling poundsโ of marijuana.\n20 Defendant BERGERON walked Plaintiff to the back of a police car, and while Plaintiff YOUNG was\n21 facing Defendant BERGERON, Defendant BERGERON pulled Plaintiff YOUNGโs pants and\n22 underwear open and away from his body exposing Plaintiffโs private parts.  Defendant BERGERON\n23 shined his flashlight on Plaintiff YOUNGโs privates, visually strip searching Plaintiff YOUNG for\n24 several seconds up to a minute.  Next, Defendant BERGERON performed a pat down search of\n25 Plaintiff YOUNG, including feeling Plaintiffโs private area through his pants.  Defendant\n26 BERGERON also ordered Plaintiff YOUNG to remove his shoes, which Defendant BERGERON\n27 then searched.  Defendant BERGERON found no contraband on Plaintiff YOUNG.  Another officer,\n28\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR CLASS ACTION AND INDIVIDUAL RELIEF FOR INJURIES AND VIOLATION OF\nCIVIL RIGHTS 8\n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-SI   Document6   Filed09/22/05   Page9 of 18\n1 Bernard Ortiz #8132, searched the interior of Plaintiff YOUNGโs car while Defendant BERGERON\n2 searched Plaintiff.\n3 39. Defendant BERGERON placed Plaintiff YOUNG in the back of a police car, still\n4 handcuffed, for well over one hour, during which time, Defendant BERGERON, other officers, and a\n5 police canine thoroughly searched Plaintiffโs car.  No drugs or other contraband were found in\n6 Plaintiff YOUNGโs car.\n7 40. Defendant BERGERON filled out a โfield contact cardโ and released Plaintiff\n8 YOUNG with no charges recommended.  Defendant BERGERON laughed as he released Plaintiff\n9 YOUNG and said he would โCatch you for something later.โ  As Plaintiff YOUNG was surveying\n10 his ransacked car, Plaintiff YOUNG told Defendant BERGERON and other officers that he was\n11 going to file a complaint against them.  Defendant BERGERON replied, โGo ahead, Iโll just get\n12 acquitted like my Rider buddies!โ\n13 41. Plaintiff YOUNG did file a complaint against Defendant BERGERON with the\n14 Oakland Citizenโs Police Review Board (CPRB), which investigated and sustained Plaintiffโs\n15 complaint, finding that Defendant โBERGERON performed an unlawful strip search on Mr.\n16 YOUNG.โ  The CPRB recommended to Defendant Chief of Police WORD that Defendant\n17 BERGERON receive training and a reprimand.\n18 42. Defendant BERGERON is among a group of only 10 Oakland police officers who\n19 received four or more complaints against them with the CPRB between January 1, 2003 and June 30,\n20 2005.\n21 43. Defendantsโ seizure and search of Plaintiff YOUNG was without a Warrant and\n22 without other legal cause.  Defendantsโ use of force against Plaintiff YOUNG was excessive and\n23 objectively unreasonable under the circumstances.\n24 44. Defendantsโ unreasonable seizures, uses of excessive force, and public strip search of\n25\nPlaintiff were done at least in part because of Plaintiffโs race and/or ethnicity.  Plaintiff is African-\n26\nAmerican.\n27\n45. At all material times, and alternatively, the actions and omissions of each defendant\n28\nwith respect to each plaintiff herein were intentional, wanton and/or willful, conscience shocking,\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR CLASS ACTION AND INDIVIDUAL RELIEF FOR INJURIES AND VIOLATION OF\nCIVIL RIGHTS 9\n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-SI   Document6   Filed09/22/05   Page10 of 18\n1 reckless, malicious, deliberately indifferent to Plaintiffโs rights, done with actual malice, grossly\n2 negligent, negligent, and objectively unreasonable.\n3 DAMAGES\n4 46. As a proximate result of Defendantsโ conduct, Plaintiffs suffered severe and extreme\n5 emotional distress, fear, terror, anxiety, humiliation, invasion of privacy and bodily integrity, and loss\n6 of their sense of security, dignity, and pride as United States citizens.\n7 47. Plaintiffs were assaulted, detained, handcuffed, illegally searched in the anus and\n8 privates in public, and falsely arrested by the defendant officers noted herein without any just\n9 provocation or probable cause.  Plaintiff FOSTER defended against the false charge of loitering and\n10 traveled from Nevada to Oakland to make a court appearance at which Defendant Officer FESTAG\n11 did not bother to appear.\n12 48. The conduct of defendant officers was malicious, wanton, reckless, and oppressive.\n13 Plaintiffs are therefore entitled to an award of punitive damages against said defendant police\n14 officers.\n15 49. Plaintiffs found it necessary to engage the services of private counsel to vindicate his\n16 rights under the law.  Plaintiffs are therefore entitled to an award of all attorneyโs fees incurred in\n17 relation to this action for violation of their civil rights.\n18 CLASS ALLEGATIONS\n19\n50. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that Defendants have followed,\n20\nand continue to follow, a custom, policy, and/or practice of strip searching individuals on public\n21\nstreets without legal cause and in violation of the United States and California Constitutions and other\n22\n23 statutes and regulations.  In addition to the types of strip searches described by Plaintiffs herein,\n24 Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege that other individuals further have been\n25\nsubjected to physical body cavity searches, including anal penetration, by Defendants and/or other\n26\nofficers of the Oakland Police Department, including but not limited to as alleged by plaintiffs in\n27\nTaylor, et. al. v. City of Oakland, Officer B. Estrada, et. al., no. C-04-4843 MHP, and Rider v. City of\n28\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR CLASS ACTION AND INDIVIDUAL RELIEF FOR INJURIES AND VIOLATION OF\nCIVIL RIGHTS 10\n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-SI   Document6   Filed09/22/05   Page11 of 18\n1 Oakland, Officer B. Estrada, Officer William BERGERON, et. al., No. C-05-3204 MHP.  Plaintiffs\n2\nare informed and believe, and thereon allege, that Defendants have disproportionately singled out\n3\nyoung men of color, predominantly African-American and Latino, for such illegal searches and\n4\nseizures.  Additionally, Defendant City of Oaklandโs police training program and written policies\n5\n6 with respect to public strip searches, including both visual and physical body cavity searches, has\n7 been, and continues to be unconstitutional and deliberately indifferent to the rights and safety of\n8\nPlaintiffs, the class described herein, and the public.\n9\n51. The conduct of Defendants with respect to Plaintiffs FOSTER, DUARTE, AND\n10\nYOUNG, as described herein, was also pursuant to the customs, policies, and/or practices set forth in\n11\n12 the preceding paragraphs and as further described below.\n13\n52. Plaintiffs FOSTER, DUARTE, and YOUNG bring this action on their own behalf and\n14\non behalf of all persons similarly situated pursuant to FRCivP 23.\n15\n53. The proposed class consists of all persons, in the period from and including August 1,\n16\n2003 to the present and continuing until this matter is adjudicated and the unlawful customs, policies,\n17\n18 and/or practices complained of herein cease, who were seized and subjected to one or more strip\n19\nand/or visual body cavity and/or physical body cavity searches in public without legal basis.\n20\n54. In accordance with F.R.Civ.P. 23, Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon\n21\nallege, that the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  Plaintiffs do not\n22\nknow the exact number of class members.\n23\n24 55. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege, these inappropriate and illegal\n25\nsearches and customs, policies, and/or practices have existed for years and will continue to affect\n26\nmore potential class members in the future.\n27\n28\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR CLASS ACTION AND INDIVIDUAL RELIEF FOR INJURIES AND VIOLATION OF\nCIVIL RIGHTS 11\n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-SI   Document6   Filed09/22/05   Page12 of 18\n1 56. There are questions of law and fact common to the class of plaintiffs, including but not\n2\nlimited to:  the legality of strip searching individuals in public and the legality of Defendant City of\n3\nOaklandโs training program and written policies with respect to public strip searches, including both\n4\nvisual and physical body cavity searches.\n5\n6 57. The claims of the representative Plaintiffs FOSTER, DUARTE and YOUNG, are\n7 typical of the claims of the class of plaintiffs.  Representative Plaintiffs FOSTER, DUARTE, and\n8\nYOUNG have the same interests and has suffered the same types of injuries as all of the class\n9\nmembers.  The claims of Plaintiffs FOSTER, DUARTE, and YOUNG and the class members arise\n10\nfrom the same customs, policies, and/or practices of the Defendants that have damaged all class\n11\n12 members.  Plaintiff FOSTER, DUARTE, and YOUNGโs interests are consistent with, and not\n13\nantagonistic to, the interests of the class.\n14\n58. The named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent and protect the interests of\n15\nthe members of the class.  Plaintiffsโ counsel are experienced in litigating federal civil rights cases,\n16\nincluding cases against the City of Oakland, alleging unlawful and inappropriate searches.  Counsel\n17\n18 have the resources and expertise to prosecute this action.\n19\n59. The prosecution of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a\n20\nrisk of inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class, and\n21\nwould establish incompatible standards of conduct for Defendants.\n22\n60. Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class,\n23\n24 thereby making final injunctive and declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole appropriate.\n25\n61. Additionally, prosecution of separate actions would create a risk of adjudications with\n26\nrespect to individual members of the class that would, as a practical matter, be dispositive of the\n27\n28\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR CLASS ACTION AND INDIVIDUAL RELIEF FOR INJURIES AND VIOLATION OF\nCIVIL RIGHTS 12\n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-SI   Document6   Filed09/22/05   Page13 of 18\n1 interests of the other members who are not parties, or would substantially impair or impede their\n2\nability to protect their interests.\n3\n4\n5\nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION\n6\n(42 U.S.C. Section 1983)\n7 (Against Defendants FESTAG, BERGERON, and DOES 1-10)\n8 62. Plaintiffs hereby re-allege and incorporate by reference herein all other paragraphs of\n9\nthis Complaint.\n10\n63.

Plaintiffs hereby re-allege and incorporate by reference herein all other paragraphs of\n3\n4 this Complaint.\n5\n65. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege that high ranking City of\n6\nOakland officials, including high ranking police supervisors, such as Defendant Richard WORD,\n7\nDOES 11 through 25, and/or each of them, knew and/or reasonably should have known about\n8\n9 repeated acts of misconduct by Defendants FESTAG, BERGERON, and DOES 1-10, and/or each of\n10 them, including illegal public strip search and anal-cavity searches without legal justification.\n11\n66. Despite having such notice, Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege that\n12\nDefendants WORD, DOES 11-25, and/or each of them, approved, ratified, condoned, encouraged\n13\nand/or tacitly authorized the continuing pattern and practice of misconduct and/or civil rights\n14\n15 violations by said officers.\n16\n67.

As against Defendant CITY, Defendant WORD and/or DOES 11-25 in his/their\n22\ncapacity as official policy-maker(s) for the CITY OF OAKLAND, Plaintiffs further allege that the\n23\n24 acts and/or omissions alleged in the Complaint herein are indicative and representative of a repeated\n25\ncourse of conduct by members of the CITY OF OAKLAND Police Department tantamount to a\n26\ncustom, policy or repeated practice of condoning and tacitly encouraging the abuse of police\n27\nauthority, and disregard for the constitutional rights of citizens.\n28\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR CLASS ACTION AND INDIVIDUAL RELIEF FOR INJURIES AND VIOLATION OF\nCIVIL RIGHTS 15\n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-SI   Document6   Filed09/22/05   Page16 of 18\n1 72.

INTRODUCTION  \n \nThe purpose of this Training Bulletin is to identify the circumstances under which \nan officer may search detainees, arrested persons, and their possessions. \n \nThe Fourth Amendment protects people against unreasonable searches and \nseizures. It is essential that officers understand the limitations the law imposes upon \ntheir conduct of a search. Police officers must constantly be aware of and comply \nwith case law that describes conditions allowing searches and seizures by the \ngovernment.  \n \nState and Federal courts do not support and routinely suppress evidence that result \nfrom searches that unreasonably infringe on the reasonable expectation of privacy \nof the person searched. Additional consequences include violations of \nDepartmental policy and claims of civil rights violations. \n \nThe intrusiveness of a search is just one element of a search but easily the single \nmost important in the reasonableness analysis conducted by State and Federal \ncourts.

CURSORY SEARCHES \n \nDuring a detention, you have no power to conduct a general, full, exploratory \nsearch of the suspect. However, you may conduct a patdown or limited weapons \nsearch of someone you have detained, but only: \n \n  For weapons,  \n  Of the person(cid:182)s outer clothing, and  \n  If you have specific facts which make you feel in danger.  \n \n(cid:179)(cid:54)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:83)(cid:85)(cid:82)(cid:70)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:88)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:180)(cid:3)is not good enough. You must reasonably suspect that the \nperson is armed or may be armed, although you do not need to be positive. The \ncourts are quite supportive of your safety. But at the very least you need a \npotentially dangerous situation to justify a patdown search. Dealing with a \nsuspected dangerous felon is by definition enough cause. However, pat searching \nthe passenger of a vehicle stopped for a traffic infraction, with nothing more, is not \njustified. \n \nExamples: \n \nA.  While on routine patrol one morning, two officers spotted a young man \nlooking into two parked cars in an alley where many complaints of criminal \nactivity(cid:178)including vehicle tampering(cid:178)had originated.

SEARCHES INCIDENT TO AN ARREST \n \nA.  Legal Requirements  \n \nThere are three requirements for a lawful search incident to an arrest:  \n \n1.  The arrest must be legal. \n \n2.

During a narcotics arrest, for example, when a hostile \ncrowd gathered, police were allowed to interrupt the search of the \nsuspect to move to a safer location in order to protect themselves \nand the arrested person. \n \n3.  The arrest must be custodial.

To help eliminate negative perceptions of peace officers(cid:182) conduct, \nofficers are encouraged to focus on developing a rapport with community members \nand refrain from immediately asking if a person is on probation or parole. Such a \nquestion, especially if it is the first question asked, infers that the community \nmember must have some sort of criminal history.

STRIP SEARCHES IN THE FIELD \n \nA.  PURPOSE \nField strip searches are significantly restricted by law.  Officers may be \nsubject to liability under state and federal law for constitutional violations.  \nUnder Penal Code Section 4030, officers who use, participate in, or allow \n7 \n \n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-SI   Document141   Filed04/18/13   Page16 of 21\n \n \nLegal Aspects of Searching Persons, Index Number I-O.02\n   \nother officers to conduct field strip searches without justification or in a \ncapricious or arbitrary manner may face criminal liability. \n \nThe purpose of this policy is to:  \n \n1.  Ensure compliance with legal standards applicable to field strip \nsearches;  \n \n2.  Establish policy requirements; and  \n \n3.  Provide officers with guidelines for determining when and under \nwhat limited conditions the use of field strip searches are authorized \nby law and this policy.  \n \nB.  POLICY  \nThe Department recognizes the intrusiveness of strip searches on individual \nprivacy and the significant legal restrictions imposed by State and Federal \nlaw.  The use of strip searches may, under certain limited conditions, be \nnecessary to protect the safety of officers and the public, and to detect and \nsecure evidence of criminal activity.  Consistent with the law, the \nDepartment discourages the use of strip searches in the field.  It is the policy \nof the Department that strip searches in the field shall be conducted only \nunder exigent circumstances and with the proper authority and justification.  \nField strip searches shall be conducted in accordance with the procedural \nguidelines as set forth in this policy and with due recognition and deference \nfor the human dignity and privacy rights of those being searched. \n \nC.  DEFINITIONS \n1.  Strip Search \n \nA strip search is a search which requires a person to remove or \narrange some or all of his or her clothing so as to permit a visual \ninspection of the underclothing, breasts, buttocks, or genitalia of \nsuch person (Penal Code 4030(c).) \n \n2.  Exigent Circumstances \n \nExigent circumstances are circumstances where the immediate need \nto perform a field strip search outweighs the need to transport the \nprisoner to a jail facility and perform a strip search in the facility in \naccordance to PC 4030.  \n8 \n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-SI   Document141   Filed04/18/13   Page17 of 21\n \n02 Apr 13 (cid:135)(cid:3)(cid:50)(cid:68)(cid:78)(cid:79)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:51)(cid:82)(cid:79)(cid:76)(cid:70)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:39)(cid:72)(cid:83)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:87)(cid:80)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:87)\n \nThe following are examples of exigent circumstances that may \nprompt a field strip search: \n \na.  The arrestee is making overt attempts to remove the \nconcealed narcotics and orally ingest them. Ingestion of the \nnarcotics can lead to choking or other medical emergency. \n \nb.  The arrestee is making overt movements to remove the \nconcealed narcotics and destroy them. \n \nc.  The arrestee is suspected of concealing a weapon.  \n \n3.  Field Strip Search \n \nA field strip search is a strip search as discussed above which is \nconducted outside of a jail facility and not as part of the booking \nprocess. \n \nD.  REQUIREMENTS AND PROCEDURES \n1.  Field strip searches shall be conducted only on persons who are \narrested, when an officer has independent probable cause to \nbelieve that the arrestee is concealing weapons or contraband, and \nunder exigent circumstances where the life of officers or civilians \nmay be at risk or evidence may be destroyed. The following \nrequirements must be met: \n \na.  Arrestee \n \nThe person on whom the strip search is conducted must be \nan arrestee.  This also applies to probationers and parolees. \n \nb.  Probable Cause for Believing the Arrestee Is Concealing \nEvidence \n \nThere must be probable cause to believe that the arrestee is \nconcealing weapons, narcotics, or contraband and the strip \nsearch will lead to the discovery of items.   \n \nc.  Urgency \n \nThere must be an urgency requiring the recovery of the items \nin the field to safeguard officers and the public from harm, \nand to protect evidence from being destroyed. \n9 \n \n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-SI   Document141   Filed04/18/13   Page18 of 21\n \n \nLegal Aspects of Searching Persons, Index Number I-O.02\n   \nd.

The Parties\n25\nThe following order pertains to all of the parties in Foster and the related cases.  A\n26\ndescription of the claims brought by the three plaintiffs in Foster is included below and is\n27\nrepresentative of the claims in the related cases brought by plaintiffs James Taylor, Robert Forbes,\n28\n2\n\nCase 3:06-cv-02426-MHP     Document 28      Filed 03/27/2008     Page 3 of 24\n1 Jimmy Rider, Tyrone Moore, Deandre Wash, Jason Cagler, Jomal Reed, Curtis Freeman, Glenn\n2 Lovely, Jeffrie Miller, Kevin Bradley and Richard Tillman. \n3\n4 A. Plaintiff Darnell Foster\n5 Plaintiff Foster is an African-American man.  On February 27, 2004 Foster was visiting a\n6 friend in Oakland, California.  At that time, he had served all but two months of a five year\n7 unsupervised probation sentence without incurring any violations.  \n8 At around 3 p.m. of that day, Officer Festag and another unknown officer stopped Foster\n9 outside the School Market on Oaklandโs School Street near Pleitner Avenue.  The officers asked\n10 Foster for identification, which he showed to them.  The officers also asked whether Foster was on\n11 probation or parole, which he answered affirmatively.  Officer Festag then handcuffed Foster and\n12 forced him against the back of his patrol vehicle parked in front of the School Market.  Foster was\nT a\nUR rni 13 ordered to spread his legs and Officer Festag searched Fosterโs pockets.  No contraband was found. \nO o\nf\nCT  Cali 14 Officer Festag then guided Foster into the rear of the patrol vehicle.  The officers ran a warrant\nC f \nI o\nR t  15 check and searched the area for evidence of illegal activity.  The searches revealed no warrants or\nT c\nS ri\nDI Dist 16 evidence of wrongdoing.\nES  n \nT er 17 Foster was then removed from the patrol vehicle by Officer Festag, who forced Foster over\nA h\nT rt\nSo\nD  N 18 the hood of the vehicle.  Wearing a latex glove retrieved from the vehicleโs trunk, Officer Festag\nE e \nh\nNIT or t 19 pulled Fosterโs pants and underwear down to his knees.  Officer Festag proceeded to search around\nUF\n20 Fosterโs testicles using his gloved hand.  The officer also spread Fosterโs buttocks and visually\n21 searched Fosterโs anus, stating โIโm going to do a butt-crack search, see if you got crack in your\n22 butt-crack.โ  Foster Compl. ยถ 5.   No contraband was discovered.\n23 The officers then pulled Fosterโs pants and underwear back up and returned him to the rear of\n24 the vehicle.  Officer Festag drove about two blocks and stopped the patrol vehicle to request that\n25 Foster make an undercover drug purchase. Foster refused to work undercover for the officers and\n26 repeatedly denied wrongdoing.  The officers then issued Foster a citation for loitering with the intent\n27 to sell narcotics before releasing him. \n28\n3\n\nCase 3:06-cv-02426-MHP     Document 28      Filed 03/27/2008     Page 4 of 24\n1 Several months later, in May, Foster received a Notice to Appear in criminal court in\n2 Oakland on the citation issued by Officer Festag.  The charge was subsequently dismissed due to the\n3 absence of both the officers to substantiate the allegation against Foster.  Foster filed an Internal\n4 Affairs complaint against Officer Festag in July 2004.  On August 1, 2005 Foster and another\n5 plaintiff filed a complaint alleging violations of their civil rights under 42 U.S.C. section 1983. \n6\n7 B. Plaintiff Rafael Duarte\n8 Plaintiff Duarte is an Hispanic-American man.  On the afternoon of March 9, 2005, while\n9 driving, Duarte and a friend were forced to a stop on Oaklandโs Baker Street, between 62nd and\n10 63rd Streets.\n11 Unknown officers emerged from two vehicles and pulled Duarte from the friendโs car\n12 without giving any orders.  Duarte was handcuffed and forced against the hood.  Duarte was then\nT a\nUR rni 13 escorted by the first officer to the front of a nearby house, where several other unknown officers\nO o\nf\nCT  Cali 14 were also present.  The first officer repeatedly pat-searched Duarte, but the search yielded no\nC f \nI o\nR t  15 contraband.\nT c\nS ri\nDI Dist 16 A second officer then informed the first officer that he thought he had seen Duarte โstuff\nES  n \nT er 17 something down his pants.โ  Foster Compl. ยถ 7.  The officers pulled down Duarteโs pants and\nA h\nT rt\nSo\nD  N 18 ordered him to bend over.  Duarteโs buttocks were spread, permitting visual inspection of his anus. \nE e \nh\nNIT or t 19 No contraband was found, but Duarte was placed in the rear of a police vehicle.  The officers then\nUF\n20 performed a strip and visual body cavity search on Duarteโs friend.  That search also yielded no\n21 contraband.  During the searches of the two men, a crowd had begun to gather around the scene,\n22 including some people with whom Duarte was acquainted.  The individuals witnessed the searches\n23 of both men.\n24 Duarte was taken to Oakland City Jail and cited after about two hours in custody.  No\n25 charges were ever filed against Duarte.  On August 1, 2005 Duarte and other plaintiffs filed charges\n26 alleging violations of their civil rights under 42 U.S.C. section 1983.\n27\n28\n4\n\nCase 3:06-cv-02426-MHP     Document 28      Filed 03/27/2008     Page 5 of 24\n1 C.

At approximately 11:30 p.m. on September\n3 30, 2003 Young was pulled over by Officer Bergeron around the 2800 block of West Street in\n4 Oakland.  Officer Bergeron opened Youngโs car door, pulled him out of the car and handcuffed him. \n5 Officer Bergeron asked Young if he was on probation or parole, which Young denied.  Officer\n6 Bergeron insisted that he smelled marijuana in Youngโs car and suggested that Young was\n7 smuggling large quantities of the drug.  \n8 Officer Bergeron then took Young to the back of a police car.  While facing Young, he\n9 pulled down Youngโs pants and underwear, revealing Youngโs genitalia.  Then Officer Bergeron\n10 shined a flashlight directed at Youngโs genitalia, visually inspecting Young for up to a minute. \n11 Officer Bergeron next performed a pat-search of Young, ordered Young to remove his shoes and felt\n12 Youngโs private area through his pants.  Another officer searched Youngโs car during the search of\nT a\nUR rni 13 Youngโs person.  No contraband was found.  \nO o\nf\nCT  Cali 14 Officer Bergeron seated a handcuffed Young in the back of a police car, where he sat for\nC f \nI o\nR t  15 over one hour.  During that time, Officer Bergeron, other officers and a police canine searched\nT c\nS ri\nDI Dist 16 Youngโs car.  That search produced no evidence of criminal activity.\nES  n \nT er 17 No charges were filed against Young.  Young subsequently filed a complaint with the\nA h\nT rt\nSo\nD  N 18 Citizensโ Police Review Board.  The Board found that Officer Bergeron performed an unlawful strip\nE e \nh\nNIT or t 19 search of Young.  Young filed a complaint on August 1, 2005.\nUF\n20\n21 D.

They have been\n2 sued in both their individual and official capacities.3 \n3   1. Oakland Police Departmentโs Policy Before 2004\n4 The Oakland Police Departmentโs 1998 policy, entitled โStrip Searches, Visual Body-Cavity\n5 Searches, and Physical Body-Cavity Searchesโ appears in the OPDโs 1998 Training Bulletin.4 \n6 Defs.โ Opp., Exh. A (โ1998 Policyโ).   The policy begins by defining the terms โstrip search,โ\n7 โvisual body-cavity searchโ and โphysical body-cavity search.โ  Id. at 8.  A strip search is โany\n8 search that requires the officer to remove or arrange some or all of a personโs clothing to permit a\n9 visual inspection of the subjectโs underclothing, breasts, buttocks, or genitals.โ  Id.  A visual body\n10 cavity search is โa search which consists of the visual inspection of the subjectโs rectal cavity and, if\n11 the subject is a female, vagina.  A visual body-cavity search does not include a search of the mouth.โ \n12 Id.  A physical body cavity search is โa search which consists of the physical intrusion into a body\nT a\nUR rni 13 cavity for the purpose of discovering a concealed object.โ  Id.  The policy next stipulates that four\nO o\nf\nCT  Cali 14 requirements must be met before a strip search or a visual body cavity search may be performed: (1)\nC f \nI o\nR t  15 โ[t]he person to be searched must be under arrest and ultimately booked;โ (2) โ[t]he arrest must be\nT c\nS ri\nDI Dist 16 for an offense involving weapons, controlled substances, or violence;โ (3) โ[t]he person conducting\nES  n \nT er 17 the search must be of the same sex as the person searched;โ and (4) โ[t]he search must be conducted\nA h\nT rt\nSo\nD  N 18 in a private area where it cannot be observed by persons not participating in the search.โ  Id. \nE e \nh\nNIT or t 19 Additionally, the policy specifies that a physical body cavity search requires a warrant.  Id.\nUF\n20 The Bulletin also discusses the permissible scope of pat searches and the requirements for\n21 searches incident to arrest.  Id. at 2โ8.  To perform a search incident to arrest, three requirements\n22 must be met: (1) โ[t]he arrest must be legal;โ (2) โ[t]he search must be contemporaneous with the\n23 arrest;โ and (3) โ[t]he arrest must be custodial.โ  Id. at 7.  The policy on searches incident to arrest\n24 also states that an officer may search a person for contraband with probable cause.  Id.  \n25 2. Oakland Police Departmentโs Amended Policy\n26 In 2004 the Oakland Police Department amended its policy on strip and body-cavity\n27 searches.  The amendments came in response to public concerns regarding the Departmentโs practice\n28\n6\n\nCase 3:06-cv-02426-MHP     Document 28      Filed 03/27/2008     Page 7 of 24\n1 of carrying out such searches.  The Department publicly identified a โlong-standing and problematic\n2 practice of conducting strip searches in the field.โ  Burris Dec., Exh. C at 4.  \n3 Similar to the 1998 Policy, the 2004 Training Bulletin defines the three types of strip\n4 searches, discusses the permissible scope of pat searches and outlines the requirements for searches\n5 incident to arrest.  Id., Exh. G (โ2004 Policyโ) at 1โ6.  Specifically, the 1998 requirements for\n6 performing a strip search were significantly amended in 2004.  Id. at 6.  In the 2004 Bulletin, the\n7 section relevant to strip searches is entitled โStrip Searches in the Field.โ  Id.  The policy stipulates\n8 that a โstrip search incident to an arrestโ may only be performed when: (1) โ[i]t is reasonable to\n9 believe that the arrestee is concealing a weapon;โ or (2) โit is reasonable to believe that the arrestee\n10 is concealing evidence or contraband;โ and (3) โthat evidence may be destroyed or ingested unless it\n11 is immediately recovered.โ  Id. (emphases omitted).  The policy goes on to say that warrantless strip\n12 searches โare not justified by the arrest itself,โ and that one must have โreasonable suspicion that the\nT a\nUR rni 13 arrestee has concealed a weapon, contraband or evidence.โ  Id. (emphasis omitted). \nO o\nf\nCT  Cali 14   Additionally, the 2004 Policy states that a strip search in the field may not be performed\nC f \nI o\nR t  15 unless the following requirements are met: (1) the officer has โreasonable suspicion to believe the\nT c\nS ri\nDI Dist 16 arrestee is hiding or concealing evidence, a weapon, or contraband;โ (2) the officer is โof the same\nES  n \nT er 17 sex as the arrestee unless there is an exigency and an officer of the same sex is not available to\nA h\nT rt\nSo\nD  N 18 respond;โ (3) the officer โmay not have physical contact with the arrestee except contact that is\nE e \nh\nNIT or t 19 reasonably necessary to search for and recover items and to control or direct the arrestee;โ (4) โthe\nUF\n20 search must be conducted so that the search cannot be easily observed by the public,โ and\n21 โreasonable efforts must be made to provide as much privacy as possible;โ and (5) the officer โmust\n22 document the search and the need to conduct the search in the field in the appropriate report.โ  Id.\n23 at 7 (emphases omitted).  Notably, the 2004 Policy explicitly prohibits officers from ever conducting\n24 a physical or visual body cavity search in the field.  Id.  \n25\n26\n27\n28\n7\n\nCase 3:06-cv-02426-MHP     Document 28      Filed 03/27/2008     Page 8 of 24\n1 3. Oakland Police Departmentโs Alleged Practice\n2 Plaintiffs allege that there is a widespread practice of public strip and body cavity searches\n3 within the Oakland Police Department that deviates from the Departmentโs recently revised policy. \n4 Plaintiffs claim that this practice occurs without regard to the privacy of subjects being searched. \n5 Subjectsโ genitalia, buttocks, and/or anuses are exposed, often without any screen from public view. \n6 This practice allegedly targets racial minoritiesโespecially Hispanic- and African-Americans.  \n7\n8 II. Procedural History\n9 Plaintiffs Foster and Duarte filed the present action on August 1, 2005.  Pursuant to\n10 stipulations, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on September 22, 2005 adding plaintiff Young. \n11 Additionally, the following actions were related to this action: (1) Rider v. City of Oakland, No. C\n12 05-3204 MHP, related on October 6, 2005; (2) Taylor v. City of Oakland, No. C 04-4843 MHP,\nT a\nUR rni 13 related on October 6, 2005; (3) Moore v. City of Oakland, No. C 06-02426 MHP, related on July 12,\nO o\nf\nCT  Cali 14 2006; and (4) Miller v. City of Oakland, No. C 07-1773 MHP, related on April 17, 2007.\nC f \nI o\nR t  15 Plaintiffsโ motion to certify a class was denied on January 27, 2007 for failure to satisfy the\nT c\nS ri\nDI Dist 16 requirement of numerosity.  Docket No. 42.  Plaintiffs now move for partial summary judgment on\nES  n \nT er 17 the following grounds: 1) declaratory relief that the 1998 Policy is unconstitutional; 2) declaratory\nA h\nT rt\nSo\nD  N 18 relief that the 2004 amended Policy is unconstitutional; 3) judgment that any search in accordance\nE e \nh\nNIT or t 19 with either of the policies is unconstitutional; 4) summary judgment on the issue of liability in favor\nUF\n20 of plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs have not moved for summary judgment on claims related to the OPDโs\n21 alleged practice.\n22\n23 LEGAL STANDARD\n24 Summary judgment is proper when the pleadings, discovery and affidavits show that there is\n25 โno genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a\n26 matter of law.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  Material facts are those which may affect the outcome of the\n27 case.  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).  A dispute as to a material fact is\n28\n8\n\nCase 3:06-cv-02426-MHP     Document 28      Filed 03/27/2008     Page 9 of 24\n1 genuine if there is sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving\n2 party.  Id.  The party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of identifying those portions\n3 of the pleadings, discovery and affidavits that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material\n4 fact.  Celotex Corp. v. Cattrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).  On an issue for which the opposing party\n5 will have the burden of proof at trial, the moving party need only point out โthat there is an absence\n6 of evidence to support the nonmoving partyโs case.โ  Id.\n7 Once the moving party meets its initial burden, the nonmoving party must go beyond the\n8 pleadings and, by its own affidavits or discovery, โset forth specific facts showing that there is a\n9 genuine issue for trial.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).  Mere allegations or denials do not defeat a moving\n10 partyโs allegations.  Id.; Gasaway v. Nw. Mut. Life Ins. Co., 26 F.3d 957, 960 (9th Cir.\n11 1994).  The court may not make credibility determinations, and inferences to be drawn from the\n12 facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.  Masson v. New\nT a\nUR rni 13 Yorker Magazine, 501 U.S. 496, 520 (1991); Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249.\nO o\nf\nCT  Cali 14 The moving party may โmove with or without supporting affidavits for a summary judgment\nC f \nI o\nR t  15 in the partyโs favor upon all [claims] or any part thereof.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  โSupporting and\nT c\nS ri\nDI Dist 16 opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be\nES  n \nT er 17 admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the\nA h\nT rt\nSo\nD  N 18 matters stated therein.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).\nE e \nh\nNIT or t 19\nUF\n20 DISCUSSION\n21 Plaintiffs seek partial summary judgment on four grounds: 1) declaratory relief that the 1998\n22 Policy is unconstitutional; 2) declaratory relief that the 2004 amended Policy is unconstitutional;\n23 3) judgment that any search in accordance with either of the policies is unconstitutional; 4) summary\n24 judgment on the issue of liability in favor of plaintiffs.  The thrust of plaintiffsโ argument is that the\n25 OPD policies should be found unconstitutional as a matter of law because the policies: 1) do not\n26 allow for individualized suspicion; 2) permit invasive searches of an arresteeโs person upon less than\n27\n28\n9\n\nCase 3:06-cv-02426-MHP     Document 28      Filed 03/27/2008     Page 10 of 24\n1 probable cause; 3) do not adequately protect a suspectโs constitutionally protected right to physical\n2 privacy; and 4) permit warrantless searches in circumstances in which a warrant is required. \n3\n4 I. Fourth Amendment Requirements\n5 The instant action presents an issue of first impression to the extent that it implicates Fourth\n6 Amendment restraints on strip searches performed outside the traditional setting of a police station\n7 or detention facility.  Before addressing the constitutionality of the OPDโs 1998 and 2004 strip\n8 search policies, it is useful to review the case law describing the requirements of the Fourth\n9 Amendment in similar contexts.  The Supreme Court has noted that there is no precise formula for\n10 reconciling the competing interests of law enforcement and individual privacy with respect to\n11 searches and seizures: \n12 The test for reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of\nT a precise definition or mechanical application.  In each case it requires a\nUR rni 13 balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of\nO fo personal rights that the search entails.  Courts must consider the scope of\nCT  Cali 14 the  particular  intrusion,  the  manner  in  which  it  is  conducted,  the\nC f  justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted. \nI o\nR t  15\nT c\nS ri Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979).  \nDI Dist 16\nES  n   โState law is also relevant in analyzing the reasonableness of a search under the Fourth\nT er 17\nA h\nT rt Amendment.โ  Edgerly v. City and County of San Francisco, 495 F.3d 645, 656 (9th Cir. 2007).\nSo\nD  N 18\nE e  The Ninth Circuit has had occasion to determine the constitutionality of various strip search\nh\nUNIT For t 19 policies employed by law-enforcement agencies.  See, e.g., Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614 (9th\n20\nCir. 1984); Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police Depโt, 901 F.2d 702 (9th Cir. 1990); Fuller v. M.G.\n21\nJewelry, 950 F.2d 1437 (9th Cir. 1991).  There are two significant differences between the policies\n22\nexamined in this line of cases and the policy at issue in the instant action.  First, the policies\n23\nconsidered in those cases were blanket strip search policies requiring that an arrestee be subjected to\n24\na strip search if the arrestee met certain criteria, e.g., if the arrestee was arrested on suspicion of\n25\ncommitting a felony.  See, e.g., Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 713 (holding that the Los Angeles Police\n26\nDepartmentโs blanket cavity search policy for felony arrests was unconstitutional).  The OPD\n27\n28\n10\n\nCase 3:06-cv-02426-MHP     Document 28      Filed 03/27/2008     Page 11 of 24\n1 policies do not require that a strip search be performed at any time; they only define when a strip\n2 search is permissible.  1998 Policy at 8; 2004 Policy at 6โ7.  Where the Ninth Circuit has found\n3 blanket strip search policies to be unconstitutional, they have done so pursuant to the Supreme\n4 Courtโs balancing test articulated in Bell.  To be clear, the OPD policies are not blanket strip search\n5 policies, and therefore do not risk violating the Supreme Courtโs balancing test on that ground. \n6 Second, the previous cases have all considered strip search policies that contemplate searches\n7 occurring post-arrest and pre-booking at a police station or other detention facility.  See Giles, 746\n8 F.2d at 617 (strip search of woman at county jail pursuant to a blanket jail policy held\n9 unconstitutional); Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 713 (strip search of woman at jail pursuant to a blanket jail\n10 policy held unconstitutional); Fuller, 950 F. 2d at 1449โ50 (strip search of woman at Los Angeles\n11 Police Department central station pursuant to a blanket policy held unconstitutional).  None have\n12 considered strip searches occurring in the field.5 \nT a\nUR rni 13 The term โstrip searchโ has been variously defined by applicable law.  It is specifically\nO o\nf\nCT  Cali 14 defined by the California Penal Code, section 4030(c) as โa search which requires a person to\nC f \nI o\nR t  15 remove or arrange some or all of his or her clothing so as to permit a visual inspection of the\nT c\nS ri\nDI Dist 16 underclothing, breasts, buttocks, or genitalia of such person.โ (emphasis added).  It is this definition \nES  n \nT er 17 the court uses here.  In fact, the Ninth Circuit in Edgerly described Californiaโs definition of โstrip\nA h\nT rt\nSo\nD  N 18 searchโ as reasonable and instructed that it โinforms our Fourth Amendment Analysis.โ  495 F.3d at\nE e \nh\nNIT or t 19 656.  \nUF\n20 Section 4030(d) of the California Penal Code defines other searches that are more instrusive:\n21 โ(2) โ[v]isual body cavity searchโ means visual inspection of a body cavity [defined as stomach,\n22 rectal cavity or vagina]. (3) โ[p]hysical body cavity searchโ means physical intrusion into a body\n23 cavity for the purpose of discovering any object concealed in the body cavity.โ\n24 Courts have taken note of the intrusive nature of strip searches, especially body cavity\n25 searches, on numerous occasions.  The Ninth Circuit observed that โ[t]he intrusiveness of a body-\n26 cavity search cannot be overstated.  Strip searches involving the visual exploration of body cavities\n27 is [sic] dehumanizing and humiliating.โ6  Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 711.   Justice Marshall remarked in\n28\n11\n\nCase 3:06-cv-02426-MHP     Document 28      Filed 03/27/2008     Page 12 of 24\n1 Bell that visual body cavity searches โrepresent one of the most grievous offenses against personal\n2 dignity and common decency.โ  441 U.S. at 576โ77 (Marshall, J., dissenting).  The majority in Bell\n3 commented that โ[a]dmittedly, this practice instinctively gives us the most pause.โ  Id. at 558.\n4 The constitutional requirements for performing the three types of strip searches differ. \n5 Physical body cavity searches are the most invasive, and, therefore, are subject to the strictest\n6 requirements.  California Penal Codes section 4030(k) requires that a physical body cavity search be\n7 performed by an authorized medical professional.  The Supreme Court has commented in the\n8 context of searches and seizures that โserious questions . . . would arise if a search involving use of a\n9 medical technique, even of the most rudimentary sort, were made by other than medical personnel or\n10 in other than a medical environmentโfor example, if it were administered by police in the privacy\n11 of the stationhouse.โ  Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 771โ72 (1966).  The Ninth Circuit has\n12 found physical body cavity searches of inmates to be unreasonable where they were performed by\nT a\nUR rni 13 inadequately trained medical assistants, holding that โissues of privacy, hygiene, and the training of\nO o\nf\nCT  Cali 14 those conducting the searches are relevant to determining whether the manner of the search was\nC f \nI o\nR t  15 reasonable.โ  Vaughan v. Ricketts, 859 F.2d 736, 741 (9th Cir. 1988).  It is clear in this Circuit that\nT c\nS ri\nDI Dist 16 physical body cavity searches may only be conducted upon probable cause and, absent an\nES  n \nT er 17 emergency, a search warrant is ordinarily required.  Fuller, 950 F.2d at 1449.  In Fuller, the Ninth\nA h\nT rt\nSo\nD  N 18 Circuit held that the Schmerber requirement that a warrant be obtained prior to performing a blood\nE e \nh\nNIT or t 19 test on an arrestee should apply with equal force to physical body cavity searches.  Id.  The court\nUF\n20 concluded that โโ[t]he interests in human dignity and privacyโ invaded when a public official peers\n21 inside a personsโs body cavity are at least as great as those invaded by a needle piercing the skin.โ \n22 Id. at 1449 (quoting Schmerber, 384 U.S. at 769โ70).\n23 With respect to visual body cavity searches, such searches may be conducted upon\n24 reasonable suspicion that a particular arrestee harbors weapons or dangerous contraband.  The\n25 purpose of this policy is to ensure that weapons, drugs or other contraband that would pose a threat\n26 to the safety or the security of the penal institution are not introduced into the facility.  Thus, the\n27 question of such a search arises when the arrestee is brought into a jail or similar institution.  Here,\n28\n12\n\nCase 3:06-cv-02426-MHP     Document 28      Filed 03/27/2008     Page 13 of 24\n1 courts have distinguished among those being admitted into the general inmate population and those\n2 who are awaiting bail or release.  See, e.g., Dobrowolskyj v. Jefferson County, 823 F.2d 955 (6th\n3 Cir. 1987) (strip search upheld where detainee was not searched until he was going to be moved to\n4 general jail population); Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007 (4th Cir. 1981) (strip search of detainee\n5 was held unconstitutional where he was not to be admitted to general jail population).   \n6  In Fuller, the Ninth Circuit noted that institutional considerationsโsuch as the safety of the\n7 broader inmate populationโjustified visual body cavity searches on less than probable cause.  950\n8 F.2d at 1447 (โ[S]trip and body cavity searches of detainees may be conducted on reasonable\n9 suspicion only where such searches are necessary to protect the overriding security needs of the\n10 institutionโ).  The court declined to extend the reasonable suspicion standard to body cavity searches\n11 for stolen property, which did not implicate these institutional concerns.  Id. at 1448.  Thus, in Fuller\n12 smuggling a ring into a detention facility was not considered a security concern, and, therefore, the\nT a\nUR rni 13 Ninth Circuit held that probable cause was required for such a search.  Most recently the Ninth\nO o\nf\nCT  Cali 14 Circuit reaffirmed in Edgerly that arrestees charged with only minor offenses may be subjected to\nC f \nI o\nR t  15 strip searches โโonly if jail officials possess a reasonable suspicion that the individual arrestee is\nT c\nS ri\nDI Dist 16 carrying or concealing contraband.โโ  495 F.3d at 656 (quoting Fuller, 950 F.2d at 1446).\nES  n \nT er 17 Courts have not often discussed the requirements for performing strip searches that do not\nA h\nT rt\nSo\nD  N 18 rise to the level of physical or visual body cavity searches.  However, they often lump them all\nE e \nh\nNIT or t 19 together with visual body cavity searches as the court did in Fuller, finding that such searches may\nUF\n20 be conducted in an institutional setting where there is reasonable suspicion that the arrestee\n21 possesses weapons or dangerous contraband such as drugs but that probable cause is required for\n22 body cavity searches for ordinary evidence.  Most cases dealing with strip searches have involved\n23 such searches occurring at a jail, police station or other place where the arrestee will be held in\n24 custody.  Courts have also made a distinction between arrestees being admitted into the general jail\n25 population and those simply awaiting bail or other custodial arrangements requiring less security\n26 concerns.  Very few have involved strip searches performed in the field.  Furthermore, all of the\n27 cases speak to strip searches of persons who have been arrested.  Courts have authorized what is\n28\n13\n\nCase 3:06-cv-02426-MHP     Document 28      Filed 03/27/2008     Page 14 of 24\n1 called a โfull search of the personโ in the field, however, when that search has been incident to\n2 arrest. United States v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218, 235 (1973).  The extent of the search in Robinson\n3 was limited to a pat-down and examination of the arresteeโs pockets, with the Court noting that the\n4 search was after a โfull-custody arrest.โ  Id. at 237 n.6.\n5 What is clear from a review of the case law is that a strip search may be conducted under the\n6 following circumstances:\n7 1) the subject has been arrested, brought to a jail or similar custodial situation and will be\n8 placed in the general custodial population or under similar housing conditions;\n9 2) there is a reasonable suspicion that the subject is secreting drugs or weapons and that\n10 reasonable suspicion is based on the nature of the offense, the subjectโs appearance and conduct and\n11 the subjectโs prior arrest record; and\n12 3) the search complies with the necessary privacy and health precautions discussed above.\nT a\nUR rni 13 What is not clear is the extent to which a strip search may be conducted in the field.  There is\nO o\nf\nCT  Cali 14 no case law suggesting that such a search may be performed in the absence of an arrest.  All of the\nC f \nI o\nR t  15 cases are premised on there being an arrest, not merely a detention or a stop for questioning.  An\nT c\nS ri\nDI Dist 16 arrest must be based on probable cause and may thus justify some type of search depending on the\nES  n \nT er 17 circumstances.  However, detentions and stops that are short of an actual arrest will not support a\nA h\nT rt\nSo\nD  N 18 strip search or, indeed, any kind of search except for a Terry search when the standards of Terry v.\nE e \nh\nNIT or t 19 Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968), justify a Terry stop.  Given the limits on strip searches even in a jail\nUF\n20 setting, certainly the limitations are greater when the search is in the field  pursuant to a valid arrest. \n21 It is clear that the โfull searchโ authorized by Robinson is ordinarily conducted for the officersโ\n22 safety.  A โfull searchโ incident to arrest, however, does not permit a strip search or bodily intrusion. \n23 Like the searches in Fuller, the searches in the instant case are unrelated to prison security.  Field\n24 strip searches by definition occur before a suspect has arrived at a detention facility.  And even after\n25 the arrestee has arrived at the facility, security concerns may not be great enough to justify invasive\n26 searches upon reasonable suspicion if the detainee is not to be admitted to the general jail population\n27 or the search is merely for evidence.  Fuller, 950 F.2d at 1448.   Only after an arrestee has arrived at\n28\n14\n\nCase 3:06-cv-02426-MHP     Document 28      Filed 03/27/2008     Page 15 of 24\n1 a detention facility does institutional security become a factor, thereby permitting searches for\n2 weapons or contraband based upon reasonable suspicion.  Prior to his arrival at the facility, an\n3 arrestee poses no threat to prison security, and officers in the field are adequately protected by their\n4 ability to perform security searches incident to arrest.\n5 Therefore, the court concludes that officers in the field are generally limited to a search\n6 incident to arrest as described in Robinson and that strip and more invasive searches in the field may\n7 only be performed under exigent circumstances and with probable cause which may, consistent with\n8 the above, require a warrant.  In sum, the court concludes that the Fourth Amendment requirements\n9 for the three types of strip searches performed in the fieldโstrip search, visual body cavity search\n10 and physical body cavity searchโare as follows:\n11\n1) there must be exigent circumstances;\n12\nT a 2) the search may only be performed on persons who have been lawfully arrested on\nUR rni 13\nO o probable cause and may not be performed on anyone for whom there is no\nf\nCT  Cali 14\nC f  probable cause to arrest;\nI o\nR t  15\nT c\nS ri 3) the search requires probable cause that is independent of the probable cause found\nDI Dist 16\nES  n  for the arrest;7\nT er 17\nA h\nT rt 4) the search may only be performed when there is probable cause to believe that the\nSo\nD  N 18\nE he  arrestee is in possession of weapons, drugs or dangerous contraband; and\nNIT or t 19\nUF\n5) additionally, physical body cavity searches require a warrant authorizing the\n20\nsearch and must be administered by an authorized medical professional.\n21\n22\n23 II. 1998 Policy\n24 Plaintiffs contend that the 1998 OPD Policy does not pass constitutional muster for four\n25 reasons: 1) the policy fails the balancing test required by the Supreme Court in Bell; 2) the policy\n26 permits invasive searches of an arresteeโs person upon less than probable cause; 3) the policy does\n27\n28\n15\n\nCase 3:06-cv-02426-MHP     Document 28      Filed 03/27/2008     Page 16 of 24\n1 not adequately protect a suspectโs constitutionally protected right to physical privacy; and 4) the\n2 policy permits warrantless searches in circumstances in which a warrant is required. \n3 Plaintiffsโ first argument is unpersuasive.  As discussed above, only blanket policies\n4 requiring strip searches at detention centers have been found unconstitutional under Bell, and the\n5 1998 OPD Policy contains no such requirement.  See, e.g., Giles, 746 F.2d at 617; Kennedy, 901\n6 F.2d at 713; Fuller, 950 F.2d at 1449โ50.  Because the 1998 Policy outlines when a strip search may\n7 be performed and requires individual determinations of suspicion, it allows for the balancing of\n8 security and privacy interests required by Bell.\n9 Plaintiffsโ second argument is that the 1998 Policy allows for strip searches on less than\n10 probable cause.  Plaintiffs claim that the policy allows strip searches to be performed upon the\n11 satisfaction of only the four requirements outlined in the OPDโs Training Bulletin section entitled\n12 โStrip Searches, Visual Body-Cavity Searches, and Physical Body-Cavity Searches:โ (1) โ[t]he\nT a\nUR rni 13 person to be searched must be under arrest and ultimately booked;โ (2) โ[t]he arrest must be for an\nO o\nf\nCT  Cali 14 offense involving weapons, controlled substances, or violence;โ (3) โ[t]he person conducting the\nC f \nI o\nR t  15 search must be of the same sex as the person searched;โ and (4) โ[t]he search must be conducted in a\nT c\nS ri\nDI Dist 16 private area where it cannot be observed by persons not participating in the search.โ  1998 Policy at\nES  n \nT er 17 8.  Defendants claim that the strip search section of the training bulletin cannot be read\nA h\nT rt\nSo\nD  N 18 independently of the entire bulletin; specifically, defendants claim that a strip search may be\nE e \nh\nNIT or t 19 performed only after the requirements of searches incident to arrest are met.  The section entitled\nUF\n20 โSearches Incident to an Arrestโ of the OPD Training Bulletin, which appears on the page previous\n21 to the section on strip searches, states that โ[w]hen an officer has probable cause to believe that\n22 contraband is on a person, an officer can search that person.โ  Id. at 7.  Plaintiffs provide no support\n23 for their argument that the sections of the training bulletin may be, or necessarily are, read\n24 independently of one another.  The court finds that the sections of the bulletin must be read together,\n25 and therefore the 1998 OPD Policy does not violate the requirement that strip searches be performed\n26 only with probable cause.8  The court notes, however, that pursuant to Way v. County of Ventura,\n27 445 F.3d 1157 (9th Cir. 2006), and Edgerly, 495 F.3d at 656 n.17, this Circuit has clearly held since\n28\n16\n\nCase 3:06-cv-02426-MHP     Document 28      Filed 03/27/2008     Page 17 of 24\n1 2006 that the inclusion of all drug offenses, without an attempt to distinguish under the influence\n2 charges from distribution charges, would not pass muster.\n3 Plaintiffs next argue that the OPDโs 1998 Policy permits strip searches of arrestees in public,\n4 and therefore, fails to protect an arresteeโs Fourth Amendment right to physical privacy.  The โplace\n5 in which [a search] is conductedโ is one of the factors the courts must consider in determining the\n6 reasonableness of a search.  Bell, 441 U.S. at 559.  Plaintiffs cite to a number of cases outside the\n7 Ninth Circuit that found public strip searches to be unconstitutional for want of privacy.  See, e.g.,\n8 Iskander v. Village of Forest Park, 690 F.2d 126 (7th Cir. 1982); Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007\n9 (4th Cir. 1981); Timberlake by Timberlake v. Benton, 786 F. Supp. 676 (M.D. Tenn. 1992).  The\n10 issue of whether the OPD has conducted strip searches in public, and whether OPD officials\n11 interpret the policy as permitting strip searches in public, is not before the court at this time.  The\n12 court must consider only whether the 1998 Policy itself  violates an arresteeโs privacy interests as a\nT a\nUR rni 13 matter of law.  The evidence suggests that an arresteeโs privacy interests are adequately protected by\nO o\nf\nCT  Cali 14 the policy.  The Training Bulletinโs fourth requirement when performing strip searches clearly states\nC f \nI o\nR t  15 that the search must be conducted in a private area, where it cannot be observed by persons not\nT c\nS ri\nDI Dist 16 participating in the search.  1998 Policy at 8.  This requirement comports with California Penal Code\nES  n \nT er 17 section 4030(m) and does not justify a finding that the policy violates privacy interests as a matter of\nA h\nT rt\nSo\nD  N 18 law.  However, to the extent that field strip searches are inconsistent with the principles set forth\nE e \nh\nNIT or t 19 above, they are violative of the Fourth Amendment.\nUF\n20 Plaintiffsโ final argument is that the 1998 Policy is unconstitutional because it permits\n21 warrantless strip searches where a warrant is required.  A warrant is required for physical body\n22 cavity searches, absent exigent circumstances.  Fuller, 950 F.2d at 1449โ50; Schmerber, 384 U.S. at\n23 770.   Only physical body cavity searches require a warrant; other strip searches may be performed\n24 without a warrant.  See, e.g., United States v. Cameron, 538 F.2d 254, 259 (9th Cir. 1976); People v.\n25 Wade,  208 Cal. App. 3d 304, 307 (1989).   Defendantsโ 1998 Policy plainly states that a physical\n26 body cavity search requires a warrant.  1998 Policy at 8.  Therefore, the 1998 Policy is not\n27 unconstitutional on these grounds. \n28\n17\n\nCase 3:06-cv-02426-MHP     Document 28      Filed 03/27/2008     Page 18 of 24\n1 As an additional matter, although the 1998 Policy requires warrants for physical body cavity\n2 searches, it does not state that such searches must be performed by a medical professional. \n3 California Penal Code section 4030(k) and federal common law require that a physical body cavity\n4 search be performed by a medical professional.  See Schmerber, 384 U.S. at 771โ72; Vaughan, 859\n5 F.2d at 741.  Given the policyโs silence on the issue, the court must conclude that the policy contains\n6 no such requirement.  In this respect, the 1998 OPD Policy is unconstitutional and in violation of\n7 California law.\n8 In sum, the OPD 1998 strip search Policy is not unconstitutional for any of the reasons put\n9 forth by plaintiffs in their motion for partial summary judgment.  It is, however, unconstitutional\n10 insofar as it allows physical body cavity searches to be performed by someone other than a medical\n11 professional. \n12\nT a\nUR rni 13 III. 2004 Policy\nO o\nf\nCT  Cali 14 Plaintiffs argue that defendantsโ 2004 strip search Policy is unconstitutional for the same\nC f \nI o\nR t  15 reasons they believe the 1998 strip search Policy is unconstitutional.  The court considers these \nT c\nS ri\nDI Dist 16 arguments with respect to the 2004 Policy in turn.  \nES  n \nT er 17 Plaintiffsโ argument that the 2004 Policy fails to allow for individual suspicion is again\nA h\nT rt\nSo\nD  N 18 unpersuasive.  Like the 1998 Policy, the 2004 Policy is not a blanket strip search policy, and\nE e \nh\nNIT or t 19 therefore allows for the balancing of interests as required by Bell.  \nUF\n20 Plaintiffs contend that the 2004 Policy similarly allows for strip searches on less than\n21 probable cause.  While defendants contend that the field strip search section of the 2004 Training\n22 Bulletin must be read together with the requirements of the other sections, the language of the 2004\n23 Policy is somewhat contradictory.  The Training Bulletin states that โ[w]hen an officer has probable\n24 cause to believe that contraband is on a person, an officer can search that person.โ  2004 Policy at 5. \n25 However, the section entitled โStrip Searches in the Fieldโ states that a strip search in the field may\n26 be conducted when it is โreasonable to believeโ that an arrestee is carrying a weapon or contraband. \n27 Id. at 6.  This language appears to require only reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip search of an\n28\n18\n\nCase 3:06-cv-02426-MHP     Document 28      Filed 03/27/2008     Page 19 of 24\n1 arrestee.  While reasonable suspicion is adequate to justify a strip search in the context of a detention\n2 facility when institutional security is a concern, in accordance with the above holding, it is\n3 insufficient to justify a strip search in the filed.  Because the language of the 2004 policy is unclear,\n4 the court assumes that the policy requires only reasonable suspicion.  In this respect the 2004 OPD\n5 strip search Policy is unconstitutional. \n6 Plaintiffs next argue that the 2004 Policy fails to protect an arresteeโs Fourth Amendment\n7 right to physical privacy.  Again, the court considers the โplace in which [a search] is conductedโ\n8 when determining the reasonableness of a search.  Bell, 441 U.S. at 559.  The 2004 OPD strip search\n9 Policy differs from the 1998 Policy with respect to an arresteeโs privacy.  While the 1998 Policy\n10 states that a strip search must be conducted in a private area where it cannot be observed by others,\n11 the 2004 Policy states that โreasonable efforts must be made to provide as much privacy as possible\n12 given the circumstances.โ  2004 Policy at 7 (emphasis omitted).  Although this language seems to\nT a\nUR rni 13 protect an arresteeโs privacy less effectively, the 2004 Policy also states that visual and physical\nO o\nf\nCT  Cali 14 body cavity searches may never be conducted in the field.  Id.  Therefore, the only type of strip\nC f \nI o\nR t  15 search that is permitted in the field by the 2004 Policy is one that does not rise to the level of a\nT c\nS ri\nDI Dist 16 cavity search, and that is only a rearrangement of the clothing.  The test for the constitutionality of a\nES  n \nT er 17 strip search is reasonableness under the circumstances.9  Bell, 441 U.S. at 559.  Because the 2004\nA h\nT rt\nSo\nD  N 18 Policy limits field searches to strip searches and requires โreasonable effortsโ to protect a suspectโs\nE e \nh\nNIT or t 19 privacy, the policy does not violate an arresteeโs right to privacy as a matter of law.\nUF\n20 Plaintiffs again argue that the 2004 Policy is unconstitutional because it permits warrantless\n21 strip searches where a warrant is required.  A warrant is required for physical body cavity searches,\n22 absent exigent circumstances.  Fuller, 950 F.2d at 1449โ50; Schmerber, 384 U.S. at 770.  Other strip\n23 searches may be performed without a warrant.  See Wade, 208 Cal. App. 3d at 307; Cameron, 538\n24 F.2d at 259.  Defendantsโ 2004 Policy plainly states that a physical body cavity search requires a\n25 warrant.10  2004 Policy at 7.  Therefore, the 2004 Policy is not unconstitutional on these grounds. \n26 In sum, the 2004 OPD strip search Policy is unconstitutional to the extent that it allows strip\n27 searches of any kind in the field to be performed on less than probable cause.\n28\n19\n\nCase 3:06-cv-02426-MHP     Document 28      Filed 03/27/2008     Page 20 of 24\n1 IV. Constitutionality of Individual Searches\n2 Plaintiffs seek summary judgment declaring any search in accordance with either of the OPD\n3 policies to be unconstitutional.  The constitutionality of an individual search, however, does not turn\n4 solely on the constitutionality of the policy pursuant to which it was performed.  See Kennedy, 901\n5 F.2d at 715.  The Ninth Circuit observed in Kennedy that โa search, although not supportable under\n6 an institutional policy, is not per se unconstitutional.โ  Id.  And in Fuller, the court noted that โ[t]he\n7 fundamental question under the fourth amendment is whether โthe grounds for a search . . . satisfy\n8 objective standardsโ of reasonableness.โ  950 F.2d at 1446 (quoting Torres v. Commonwealth of\n9 Puerto Rico, 442 U.S. 465, 471 (1979)) (emphasis omitted).  Thus, even if a policy permitting a\n10 search passes constitutional muster, an individual search must be evaluated based upon the above\n11 standards.  Where a policy permits searches that may be unconstitutional, an individual search must\n12 still meet constitutional standards.  Where the officer claims to rely on an unconstitutional policy,\nT a\nUR rni 13 the rules regarding qualified immunity apply and liability must depend upon the facts of the\nO o\nf\nCT  Cali 14 particular case.  \nC f \nI o\nR t  15 To the extent that the OPD policies are inconsistent with the foregoing standards, the court\nT c\nS ri\nDI Dist 16 must determine the appropriate relief.\nES  n \nT er 17\nA h\nT rt\nSo\nD  N 18 V. Liability\nE e \nh\nNIT or t 19 Plaintiffs seek summary judgment on the issue of liability in favor of the plaintiffs.  As noted\nUF\n20 in the previous section, the court is presently unable to determine the constitutionality of any\n21 particular search in the instant case until further evidence is submitted.  To the extent that the court\n22 has found certain policies do not meet constitutional standards, defendant Oakland must bring its\n23 policies into compliance.  \n24\n25 VI. Objections to Related Case\n26 Defendants argue in one sentence in a footnote that the defendants in Miller v. City of\n27 Oakland have not been served or have not yet appeared in the case, and therefore should not be\n28\n20\n\nCase 3:06-cv-02426-MHP     Document 28      Filed 03/27/2008     Page 21 of 24\n1 included in this motion for partial summary judgment.  Plaintiffs note that defendants Oakland and\n2 Richard Word filed an answer in Miller on April 19, 2007.  The court therefore finds that the parties\n3 in Miller are proper parties to this motion.\n4\n5 VII. Evidentiary Issues\n6 Defendants ask the court to take judicial notice of two separate sets of documents: 1) the\n7 1998 and 2004 OPD strip search policies, and 2) documents in this case and in Cammerin K. Boyd\n8 v. City of Oakland, Case No. 03-3391 JL (N.D. Cal.).  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 201, the\n9 court takes judicial notice of the 1998 and 2004 OPD policies as they are capable of accurate and\n10 ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.  See Fed.\n11 R. Evid. 201(b)(2); see also Hott v. City of San Jose, 92 F. Supp. 2d 996, 998 (N.D. Cal. 2000)\n12 (Fogel, J.) (holding the court may take judicial notice of relevant documents).  Plaintiffs have not\nT a\nUR rni 13 objected to defendantsโ request for judicial notice.  Accordingly, the court GRANTS the defendantsโ\nO o\nf\nCT  Cali 14 request for judicial notice of the OPD policies.  The court declines to take judicial notice of the\nC f \nI o\nR t  15 second set of documents because it has not considered them here. \nT c\nS ri\nDI Dist 16 Defendants have submitted a separate statement of genuine issues to which plaintiffs object. \nES  n \nT er 17 Because the court has not considered this statement, the court need not address plaintiffsโ objections\nA h\nT rt\nSo\nD  N 18 at this time.\nE e \nh\nNIT or t 19 /////\nUF\n20 /////\n21 /////\n22 /////\n23 /////\n24 /////\n25 /////\n26 /////\n27\n28\n21\n\nCase 3:06-cv-02426-MHP     Document 28      Filed 03/27/2008     Page 22 of 24\n1 CONCLUSION\n2 For the reasons stated above, the court GRANTS IN PART plaintiffsโ motion for partial\n3 summary judgment with respect to the request for declaratory relief that the 1998 and 2004 OPD\n4 policies are unconstitutional in certain respects, and DENIES the motion for summary judgment on\n5 liability and declaratory relief on the individual searches at issue.\n6 The parties shall arrange a case management conference with the court to discuss the\n7 remedies necessary to comply with this order and for further proceedings in this and the other related\n8 cases.\n9 IT IS SO ORDERED.\n10 Dated: March 27, 2008                                                                     \nMARILYN HALL PATEL\n11 United States District Court Judge\nNorthern District of California\n12\nT a\nUR rni 13\nO o\nf\nCT  Cali 14\nC f \nI o\nR t  15\nT c\nS ri\nDI Dist 16\nES  n \nT er 17\nA h\nT rt\nSo\nD  N 18\nE e \nh\nNIT or t 19\nUF\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n22\n\nCase 3:06-cv-02426-MHP     Document 28      Filed 03/27/2008     Page 23 of 24\n1 ENDNOTES\n2 1.

The words โTraining Bulletin,โ โBulletinโ and โpolicyโ are used interchangeably in this\n9\norder. \n10\n5. The court understands โin the fieldโ to mean a search conducted outside the privacy of a\n11 police station or detention center, contrary to plaintiffsโ repeated implication that โin the fieldโ is\nsynonymous with โin public.โ  Former OPD Chief Richard Wordโs internal communication indicates\n12\nthat an appropriate place for a field search would be inside an unoccupied private or public\nT a\nUR rni 13 restroom; it would be a stretch to characterize a search conducted in such surroundings as a search\nO o\nf โin public.โ  Nisenbaum Dec., Exh. A at 33.\nCT  Cali 14\nIC of  6. Since, as can be seen from this sentence, the term โstrip searchโ has been used to denote a\nR t  15\nST ric wide variety of search practices varying in their degree of intrusiveness, this court, as stated above,\nDI Dist 16 uses the California Penal Code definitions.\nES  n \nT er 17 7.

This action arises under Title 42 of the United States Code, Section 1983.  Jurisdiction\n23\nis conferred upon this Court by Title 28 of the United States Code, Sections 1331 and 1343.  The\n24\nunlawful acts and practices alleged herein occurred in the County of Alameda, California, which is\n25\nwithin this judicial district.\n26\n27\n28\nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND DAMAGES - 1\n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-MHP   Document1    Filed08/01/05   Page2 of 13\n1 PARTIES\n2 2. Plaintiff herein, DARNELL FOSTER (โFOSTERโ), is readily recognizable as an\n3 African-American male and was at all times herein mentioned a citizen of the United States residing\n4 in Alameda County in California.\n5 3. Plaintiff herein, RAFAEL DUARTE (โDUARTEโ), is readily recognizable as an\n6 Hispanic-American was at all times herein mentioned a citizen of the United States residing in\n7 Alameda County in California.\n8 4. Defendant City of Oakland (โCITYโ) is a municipal corporation, duly organized and\n9 existing under the laws of the State of California.  The City operates under its authority the Oakland\n10 Police Department.\n11 5. At all times mentioned herein, Defendant RICHARD WORD was employed by\n12 Defendant CITY as Chief of Police for the Defendant CITY.  He is being sued in his official capacity\n13 as Chief of Police for the City.\n14 6. At all times mentioned herein, Defendant officer J. FESTAG (โFESTAGโ) was\n15 employed by Defendant CITY as a police officer.  He is being sued individually and in his official\n16 capacity as a police officer for the City.\n17 7. Plaintiffs are ignorant of the true names and capacities of Defendants DOES 1 through\n18 25, inclusive, and therefore sue these defendants by such fictitious names.  Plaintiffs are informed\n19 and believe and thereon allege that each Defendant so named is responsible in some manner for the\n20 injuries and damages sustained by Plaintiffs as set forth herein.  Plaintiffs will amend their complaint\n21 to state the names and capacities of DOES 1-25, inclusive, when they have been ascertained.\n22 8. In engaging in the conduct described herein, Defendant police officers acted under the\n23 color of law and in the course and scope of their employment with the City.  In engaging in the\n24 conduct described herein, Defendant police officers exceeded the authority vested in them as police\n25 officers under the United States and California Constitutions and as police officers employed by\n26 Defendant CITY.\n27\n28\nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND DAMAGES - 2\n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-MHP   Document1    Filed08/01/05   Page3 of 13\n1 STATEMENT OF FACTS\n2 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS REGARDING PLAINTIFF DARNELL FOSTER\n3 9. On February 27, 2004, at around 3 p.m., Defendant Officer FESTAG stopped Plaintiff\n4 FOSTER in front of a small market, the โSchool Marketโ, located near the corner of School Street\n5 and Pleitner Avenue in Oakland, Caifornia.\n6 10. Plaintiff FOSTER lived in Carson City, Nevada at the time, but was visiting friends\n7 who lived in Oakland.  Plaintiff FOSTER had purchased two Black and Mild cigars at the School\n8 Market shortly before Defendant Officer FESTAG and one other unknown Oakland Police Officer\n9 DOE stopped him.  He possessed no contraband and was not engaged in any illegal activity\n10 whatsoever.  Defendant Officers stopped Plaintiff FOSTER as he walked out of the School Market\n11 and asked him for his identification.   Plaintiff FOSTER showed the officer his identification.  The\n12 officers then asked him whether he was on probation or parole.  Plaintiff FOSTER honestly replied\n13 that he was on probation. In fact, Plaintiff FOSTER,  only two months remained of the five year\n14 felony unsupervised probation sentence for possession for sale of marijuana. Plaintiff FOSTER had\n15 served his probation sentence without incurring  a single violation.  Plaintiff FOSTER told Defendant\n16 Officer FESTAG that he had only two months remaining on his probation.\n17 11. Defendant Officer FESTAG handcuffed Plaintiff FOSTER without explanation and\n18 escorted him to the back of his patrol vehicle, which was parked in front of the School Market.\n19 Defendant Officer FESTAG forced Plaintiff FOSTER against the back of the patrol vehicle and\n20 ordered him to spread his legs.  Defendant Officer FESTAG searched Plaintiff FOSTERโs pockets\n21 and found $22.  Defendant Officer FESTAG told Plaintiff FOSTER that the $22 would be\n22 confiscated.  Even though Plaintiff FOSTER had committed no crime and was not involved in any\n23 manner of illegal activity, Defendant Officer FESTAG informed Plaintiff FOSTER that the $22\n24 found in Plaintiff FOSTERโs pocket was proceeds of narcotics sales.  Defendant Officer FESTAG\n25 claimed that Plaintiff FOSTER was engaged in narcotics sales.  He handcuffed Plaintiff FOSTER and\n26 placed him in the rear of the police vehicle.\n27 12. The unknown Officer DOE ran Plaintiff FOSTERโs name for a warrant check.  The\n28 search revealed no warrants for Plaintiff FOSTER.  Defendant Officer FESTAG searched the area\nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND DAMAGES - 3\n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-MHP   Document1    Filed08/01/05   Page4 of 13\n1 around the market and located no evidence of any illegal activity relating to Plaintiff FOSTER.  In\n2 spite of the circumstances, which overwhelmingly indicated that Plaintiff FOSTER had not\n3 committed any crime, Defendant Officer FESTAG maliciously told Plaintiff FOSTER that he was\n4 going to violate his probation.  Defendant Officer FESTAG told Plaintiff FOSTER, โI think youโre\n5 holding out on me,โ even though there was no basis to believe that Plaintiff FOSTER was engaged in\n6 illegal activity.\n7 13. Defendant Officer FESTAG removed Plaintiff FOSTER, still handcuffed, from the\n8 back of the patrol vehicle and bent him over the hood of the police car. Defendant Officer FESTAG\n9 opened the patrol vehicleโs trunk and put on a purple latex glove.   He then returned to Plaintiff\n10 FOSTER and ordered him to bend over the hood of the patrol vehicle. Plaintiff FOSTER stood in the\n11 gutter, between the sidewalk and the police car, handcuffed, while Defendant Officer FESTAG\n12 yanked Plaintiff FOSTERโs gray sweat pants down to his knees.  Defendant Officer FESTAG then\n13 yanked Plaintiff FOSTERโs boxer shorts down to his knees, exposing Plaintiff FOSTERโs genitalia.\n14 Humiliated and stunned, Plaintiff FOSTER felt Defendant Officer FESTAGโs hands reach under his\n15 testicles.  Consistent with Plaintiff FOSTERโs  innocence, this offensive sexual battery showed that\n16 Plaintiff FOSTER possessed no contraband at all.\n17 14.  To Plaintiffโs shock and disbelief, Defendant Officer FESTAG told Plaintiff FOSTER\n18 โIโm going to do a butt-crack search, see if you got crack in your butt-crack.โ  Plaintiff FOSTER was\n19 forced to comply with Defendant Officer FESTAGโs outrageous conduct.  Defendant Officer\n20 FESTAG spread Plaintiff FOSTERโs butt-cheeks with his right hand and exposed the anus.  The\n21 unknown Officer DOE was also present, and both officers inspected Plaintiff FOSTERโs anus.\n22 Predictably, this unwarranted intrusive search failed to reveal any contraband.\n23 15. Defendant Officers pulled Plaintiffโs underwear and sweat pants up and put him back\n24 in the rear of the patrol vehicle.  Despite the complete lack of evidence, Defendant Officer FESTAG\n25 told Plaintiff that he was going to take him to jail for โloitering with the intent to sell narcotics.โ\n26 Plaintiff FOSTER denied loitering and told the officers that he had just gone to the store, and was not\n27 involved in any drug activity.\n28\nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND DAMAGES - 4\n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-MHP   Document1    Filed08/01/05   Page5 of 13\n1 16. Defendant Officer FESTAG drove about two blocks away and stopped the patrol\n2 vehicle near the corner of Texas and Maple Streets.  One of the Defendant Officers asked Plaintiff\n3 FOSTER if he knew anyone who sold marijuana. When Plaintiff FOSTER said โno,โ the officers\n4 asked him to make an undercover drug purchase.   After Plaintiff FOSTER refused to become a\n5 snitch for the officers, Defendant Officer FESTAG told Plaintiff FOSTER โHelp me so I can help\n6 you.โ\n7 17. Plaintiff FOSTER again asked the officers what he had done, and they again claimed\n8 that he had sold narcotics. When Plaintiff FOSTER truthfully stated that he had not sold narcotics,\n9 the officers insisted that Plaintiff FOSTER sign a citation for violating an Oakland Municipal\n10 Ordinance prohibiting loitering with the intent to sell narcotics.  Plaintiff FOSTER signed the citation\n11 and Defendant Officer released him.  Defendant Officers kept Plaintiff FOSTER handcuffed\n12 throughout the incident, which lasted nearly half an hour.\n13 18. After being released, Plaintiff FOSTER returned to the same store, โSchool Marketโ\n14 and spoke with the store clerk.  The clerk told Plaintiff FOSTER that one of the officers had come in\n15 and asked him how long Plaintiff FOSTER had been in the store.  The clerk stated that he had told\n16 the officer Mr. FOSTER had come into the store just before the police came.\n17 19. Plaintiff FOSTER returned home to Carson City, Nevada.  Several months later, in\n18 May, Plaintiff FOSTER received a Notice to Appear in Criminal court in Oakland in September 2004\n19 on the citation issued by Defendant Officer FESTAG.    Plaintiff FOSTER called the Oakland Police\n20 Department Internal Affairs Division and filed an Internal Affairs complaint against Defendant\n21 Officer FESTAG sometime around July 2004.   In order to defend against the false loitering charges,\n22 Plaintiff FOSTER traveled from Nevada to Oakland and appeared in court in Oakland on September\n23 24, 2004.  The charge against him was dismissed when neither Officer FESTAG, nor any other\n24 officer, appeared in court to substantiate the false allegation against Plaintiff FOSTER.\n25 20. Plaintiff FOSTER alleges, on information and belief, that defendant officers had\n26 insufficient information, and no particularized facts, to support their stop, detention, and search of\n27 Plaintiff.\n28\nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND DAMAGES - 5\n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-MHP   Document1    Filed08/01/05   Page6 of 13\n1 21. The detention, search, and arrest of Plaintiff FOSTER described herein was done\n2 without any just provocation or cause, proximately causing Plaintiff FOSTERโs injuries and resulting\n3 damages.\n4 22. Plaintiff FOSTER alleges on information and belief that defendant officers performed\n5 the public, intrusive anal-cavity search without probable or reasonable cause pursuant to an official or\n6 de facto CITY OF OAKLAND policy condoning and/or ratifying such illegal searches\n7 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS REGARDING PLAINTIFF RAFAEL DUARTE\n8 23. On the afternoon of March 9, 2005, Plaintiff RAFAEL DUARTE was a passenger in a\n9 car driven by a friend of his, Deandre Wash. Mr. Wash drove a late-80s model Toyota Supra. Two\n10 all-black Oakland Police vehicles, believed to be โtask-forceโ vehicles, cut the Supra off without\n11 warning, forcing the car  to a sudden stop on Baker Street between, between 62nd and 63rd Street in\n12 Oakland.\n13 24. Although the Officers gave no orders to Plaintiff or Mr. Wash, at least one Defendant\n14 Officer DOE opened the passenger side door and yanked Plaintiff DUARTE from the vehicle.\n15 Although Plaintiff DUARTE had committed no crime, the DOE police officer forced him against the\n16 Toyotaโs hood and handcuffed him.  The DOE police officer then walked Plaintiff DUARTE to the\n17 front-side of a nearby house.   Several other unknown Defendant Officer DOES were also present at\n18 the scene.  The DOE police officer pat-searched Plaintiff DUARTE several times and then searched\n19 him thoroughly.  The search yielded no contraband.\n20 26. Plaintiff DUARTE protested, stating that he had not committed any crime and was not\n21 in possession of any contraband.  Even though the searches performed by  Officer DOE confirmed\n22 that Plaintiff DUARTE had committed no crime and possessed no contraband, one other Defendant\n23 Officer DOE 2 told the first Officer DOE that he thought he had seen Plaintiff DUARTE โstuff\n24 something in his pants.โ\n25 27. Defendant Officers pulled Plaintiff DUARTEโs pants down and ordered him to bend\n26 over.  To Plaintiff DUARTEโs shock and humiliation, one of the Defendant Officer DOES spread\n27 Plaintiff DUARTEโs butt-cheeks exposing his anus.  The search proved fruitless.  Plaintiff DUARTE\n28 possessed no contraband anywhere.\nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND DAMAGES - 6\n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-MHP   Document1    Filed08/01/05   Page7 of 13\n1 28. Plaintiff DUARTE was placed in the rear of the police vehicle.  Defendant Officers\n2 then removed Plaintiffโs friend, Mr. Wash, from the vehicle and performed the same type of anal-\n3 cavity search on Mr. WASH.  That search also yielded no contraband whatsoever.  A crowd of\n4 people had gathered during the search, and Plaintiff DUARTE was acquainted with some of the\n5 people who witnessed the outrageous anal-cavity search of Plaintiff and his friend, Mr. Wash.\n6 29. Plaintiff DUARTE was transported to Oakland City Jail where he was cited out after\n7 about two hours in custody. Plaintiff DUARTE told the officer who took his fingerprints about the\n8 anal-cavity search and was told by the officer to file an Internal Affairs complaint.  He was also told\n9 that his civil rights had been violated and that he should file a lawsuit.  No charges were ever filed\n10 against Plaintiff DUARTE.\n11 30.  Plaintiff DUARTE alleges, on information and belief, that defendant officers had\n12 insufficient information, and no particularized facts, to support their stop, detention, and search of\n13 Plaintiff.\n14 31. The detention, search, and arrest of Plaintiff DUARTE described herein was done\n15 without any just provocation or cause, proximately causing Plaintiff DUARTEโs injuries and\n16 resulting damages.\n17 32. Plaintiff DUARTE alleges on information and belief that defendant officers performed\n18 the public, intrusive anal-cavity search without probable or reasonable cause pursuant to an official or\n19 de facto CITY OF OAKLAND policy condoning and/or ratifying such illegal searches\n20\n21 DAMAGES\n22 33. As a proximate result of Defendantsโ conduct, Plaintiffs suffered severe and extreme\n23 emotional distress, fear, terror, anxiety, humiliation, and loss of their sense of security, dignity, and\n24 pride as United States citizens.\n25 34. Plaintiffs were assaulted, detained, handcuffed, illegally searched in the anus in public,\n26 and falsely arrested by the  defendant officers noted herein without any just provocation or probable\n27 cause.  Plaintiff FOSTER defended against the false charge of loitering and traveled from Nevada to\n28 Oakland to make a court appearance at which Defendant Officer FESTAG did not bother to appear.\nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND DAMAGES - 7\n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-MHP   Document1    Filed08/01/05   Page8 of 13\n1 35. The conduct of defendant officers was malicious, wanton, and oppressive.  Plaintiffs\n2 are therefore entitled to an award of punitive damages against said defendant police officers.\n3 36. Plaintiffs found it necessary to engage the services of private counsel to vindicate his\n4 rights under the law.  Plaintiffs are therefore entitled to an award of all attorneyโs fees incurred in\n5 relation to this action for violation of their civil rights.\n6\n7 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION\n(42 U.S.C.

It appears that the latter action was related to the constellation of cases related to \n26 C-04-4843 by order dated February 17, 2010, but that the earlier of the two cases was not related\n27 although it had been assigned to this judge.  Apparently no proposed order was submitted and no\n28 //\n2\n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-SI   Document112   Filed03/04/10   Page3 of 4\n1 action was actually taken relating that case.  Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that C-08-\n2 4255MHP is deemed related to C-04-4843MHP.\n3 The court also notes in reviewing these two cases that a disturbing pattern seems to be\n4 emerging.  Claims are being misjoined, for in both of these cases there are individuals making\n5 claims that although they may be related as to common questions of law, do not allege incidents\n6 occurring on the same date or involving the same facts, persons or officers.  Each of the incidents\n7 complained of  in these cases is separate and distinct.  \n8 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 18(a) provides that โ[a] party asserting a claim...may\n9 join...as many claims as it has against an opposing party.โ  Whether claims are misjoined is\n10 governed by Rule 21 which adverts to Rule 20(a)(1) when determining whether separate persons\n11 may join in a single action.  That rule states that such claims may be joined if โ(A) they assert any\n12 right to relief jointly, severally, or in the alternative with respect to or arising out of the same\n13 transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences; and (B) any question of law or\n14 fact common to all plaintiffs will arise in the action.โ  These two conditions are in the conjunctive. \n15 Any claims failing to meet these conditions are โmisjoinedโ.  The court finds that the claims in C-\n16 08-4255 and C-09-5316 are misjoined.\n17 In accordance with Rule 21, the remedy may be the dropping of some of the parties from the\n18 complaint or the severance of claims.  The court finds that the better procedure, since these plaintiffs\n19 should not all be joining in the same action, is for the court to give plaintiffs in these actions twenty\n20 (20) days to drop all but one of the plaintiffs in each of these actions and file new actions as to each\n21 of the dropped plaintiffs.  The court will consider the dates of the original filings as being the dates\n22 of filings for the new actions.  In other words, the statute of limitations is deemed tolled as of the\n23 date of original filing and will continue tolled until the new actions are filed, if they are filed within\n24 the twenty days or, if extended by the court, within the extended time.\n25 //\n26 //\n27 //\n28 //\n3\n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-SI   Document112   Filed03/04/10   Page4 of 4\n1 In the future, counsel for plaintiffs are instructed that any new actions shall comply with the\n2 preceding paragraphs.  The court will not allow the joining of claims that do not meet the provisions\n3 of Rule 20(a)(1).\n4 THE FOREGOING IS SO ORDERED.\n5\n6 Dated: March 3, 2010 _________________________\nMARILYN HALL PATEL\n7 United States District Court Judge\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n4",

Events of September 30, 2003 \n= \n~  18  On September 30, 2003, at approximately 11 :30 p.m., defendant Bergeron pulled plaintiff \n19  Young over at approximately the 2800 block of West Street, in Oakland, California.  Young is an \n20  African-American man and was wearing blue jeans, a belt, a shirt and shoes.  Docket No.1 03' \n21  (Haddad Dec.), Exh. A (Young Depo.) at 19.  Young was not on probation or parole.  Bergeron, who \n22  was driving his patrol car with a partner, Officer Bernard Ortiz, first observed Young's car as it \n23  turned from 29th Street onto West Street.  Id., Exh. B (Bergeron Dep.) at 24.  According to \n24  Bergeron, Young's car seemed to have been traveling \"faster than it should have been for having to \n25  stop at a stop sign.\" Bergeron admits that he did not actually see Young roll through the stop sign \n26  and did not witness any sort of moving violation at the area of the stop sign.  Id.  Bergeron did notice \n27  an air freshener hanging from Young's rearview mirror.  The air freshener was, according to \n28  Bergeron, \"one ofthe Christmas tree or the tree-shaped air fresheners.\"  According to Bergeron, the \n3 \n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-SI   Document99   Filed12/14/09   Page4 of 18\n1  dimensions of the air freshener were four to five inches long by two to four inches wide.  Id. at 25. \n2  Bergeron believed that the air freshener hanging from Young's rearview mirror constituted a \n3  violation of California Vehicle Code 26708(a)(2), which prohibits the driving of a vehicle \"with any \n4  object or material placed ... in or upon a vehicle that obstructs or reduces the driver's clear view \n5  through the windshield or side windows.\" [d.; see Cal. Veh. Code ยง 26708(a)(2).  For this reason, \n6  Bergeron pulled Young over.  Bergeron Dep. at 24-25. \n7  After Young pulled his car over, Bergeron approached the driver's side window of Young's \n8  car.  Bergeron told Young why he had been stopped, stated that Bergeron needed to remove the air \n9  freshener, and asked for Young's driver's license, registration and insurance.  !d. at 25, 28.  During \n10  this process, Bergeron smelled a strong odor of fresh marijuana coming from inside the vehicle.  He \n... \n... \n11  also observed a bunch of small pieces of what he believed to be marijuana crumbs on the front of \n= \nU.0..    'E\"   12  Young's shirt.  [d. at 28-29.  Bergeron believed there was probable cause to arrest Young for \n<8 \n...r.-,....I    iu   13  possession of marijuana for use or distribution.  The odor emanating from the car was so strong that \n\"-\"' \n.- 0 \nrIl  u  14  Bergeron believed there to be more marijuana in the car or on Young's person.  !d. at 29-30.  It \n'~ \n~ \n...  Ci \n.r~.I.l    0E)   15  smelled like a significant amount.  [d. at 61.  Ortiz also smelled a very potent smell of marijuana \n..0 \n~ t::: \nz0  \nrJJ  16  emanating from Young's car.  Docket No. 108 (Def.'s Supporting Evid.), Exh. 4, Attachment 3 \n\"..0.   -0s)  \n.... \n.~- u0. .  17  (Ortiz Depo.) at 5-6.  According to Bergeron, Young admitted at some point that he had smoked \n= \n~  18  marijuana earlier that day.  !d., Attachment 1, Exh. 2 (comment on field contact report); Bergeron \n19  Depo. at 60.  Bergeron did not know Young and had never heard of him prior to stopping him. \n20  Bergeron Depo. at 61. \n21  Young was asked to step out of his car.  !d. at 32.  After Bergeron handcuffed Young, he \n22  recovered the substance from Young's shirt by scraping it off with an assignment card.  Id. at 30. \n23  Later, Bergeron packaged the substance in an Oakland Police Department (\"OPD\") Criminalistics \n24  Section envelope, but Bergeron does not know if the substance was ever tested to confirm whether it \n25  was marijuana.  [d. at 32. \n26  Bergeron took Young to the rear of the police car on the driver's side.  [d. at 33.  Using a \n27  grasping hand technique, Bergeron conducted a pat-down search of Young's entire body, with \n28  Young facing away from Bergeron and toward the police car.  The pat-down did not reveal any \n4 \n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-SI   Document99   Filed12/14/09   Page5 of 18\nmarijuana or other contraband.  Id. at 35.  Bergeron does not recall requiring Young to take his shoes \n2  off.  Id. at 43.  Based on the continuing marijuana smell, the apparent pieces of marijuana on the \n3  front of Young's shirt, and Bergeron's experience and training, Bergeron suspected Young had \n4  concealed marijuana under his clothing.  Id. at 35-38.  Bergeron turned Young around and grabbed \n5  the front of Young's pants.  According to Bergeron's version of what followed, which must be \n6  accepted as true for purposes of the instant motion, Bergeron pulled the front of Young's pants out \n7  and shined his flashlight down the front.  Bergeron did not pull Young's underwear out so as to see \n8  Young's privates.  The visual inspection lasted \"less than ten seconds for sure.\" Id. at 40. \n9  At the same time that Bergeron shined his flashlight down Young's pants, Ortiz was \n10  searching \"every part of [Young's] car that [he] could think of.\"  Ortiz Depo. at 11.  Bergeron placed \n... \n11  Young in the patrol car and then conducted a records check of Young via the vehicle computer in the \n;=..  \n0 \nU...   <O8J   12  police car.  Bergeron Depo. at 58-59.  The records check showed that Young did not have any \n:-ยง \n..~.-.  <ua   13  warrants at that time.  Id. at 59.  Bergeron then assisted Ortiz in searching Young's vehicle.  Id.  No \n;.. \n'-\n.- 0 \nrIJ \n<~  14  contraband was found~ despite what smelled like a significant amount of fresh marijuana.  Id. at 60-\n~ \n...  i5 \nrIJ  E  15  61.  Unable to find the source of the smell, Bergeron and Ortiz conferred with a sergeant who was \n.~..  \" \n..c \n~ t:: \nz0  \nr:J\"J.  16  not on the scene.  The officers decided to call a canine officer, Diane Nichelini, to the scene.  !d. at \n\".'.0.   .vs  \n:s \n.~- w..  17  62.  Nichelini arrived and could smell the marijuana from ten feet away.  Def.'s Supporting Evid., \n= \nP \n18  Exh. 4, Attachment 4 (Nichelini Depo.) at 6-8.  During a ten-to-fifteen minute search, her dog got a \n19  \"hit\" in the rear ofthe car, but the dog did not give Nichelini a \"true alert.\"  The officers checked the \n20  rear seat area of the car but were again unable to locate any contraband.  Id. at 9-10; Bergeron Depo. \n21  at 63.  After completing their search, the officers released Young pursuant to California Penal Code \n22  section 849(b).  Id.; see Cal. Penal Code ยง 849(b) (allowing release from custody without booking of \n23  individual arrested without warrant where officer is satisfied insufficient grounds exist for making a \n24  criminal complaint).  Although Bergeron thought the substance found on Young's shirt was \n25  marijuana, Bergeron concluded that it was not a \"usable amount\" and therefore was not enough to \n26  provide the basis for a citation.  Bergeron Depo. at 32.  The OPD Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) \n27  report indicates that Bergeron pulled Young over at 11 :33 p.m. and that Bergeron left the scene at \n28  1: 11 a.m.  Haddad Dec., Exh. C (CAD Report); see Bergeron Depo. at 63-66. \n5 \n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-SI   Document99   Filed12/14/09   Page6 of 18\n1  II.  The 1998 OPD Strip Search Policy \n2  At the time of the incident, Bergeron did not believe the type of search he performed on \n3  Young was a \"strip search.\" Id. at 43, 48.  At that time, OPD had a policy in place entitled \"The \n4  Legal Aspects of Searching Persons.\"  This policy had been in place since 1998.  Haddad Dec., \n5  Exh. D (1998 Policy) at 1.  It defined a strip search as \"any search that requires the officer to remove \n6  or arrange some or all ofa person's clothing to permit a visual inspection of the subject's \n7  underclothing, breasts, buttocks, or genitals.\" Id. at 8.  The policy further instructed, \n8  A strip search or visual body-cavity search may be conducted only if all of the \nfollowing conditions are met: \n9  โข  The person to be searched must be under arrest and ultimately booked. \nโข  The arrest must be for an offense involving weapons, controlled substances, or \n10  violence. \n...  โข  The person conducting the search must be of the same sex as the person \n11  searched . \nJ,.o \nโข  The search must be conducted in a private area where it cannot be observed by \nu.0=.=.     \"'ยง\"   12  persons not participating in the search. \n;.g,  \n.-\n.(..j   u  13  Id.

Relevant Procedural History \n\".'.C.   -'5\"  \n.<-1#  15 \n[..l...  17  Plaintiffs Foster and Duarte filed the present action on August 1, 2005.  Pursuant to \n= \n;;;;J \n18  stipulations, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on September 22,2005, adding plaintiff Young. \n19  On March 27, 2008, the court partially granted and partially denied plaintiffs' partial motion for \n20  summary judgment.  Docket No. 71 (\"March 2008 Order\").  Plaintiffs moved for partial summary \n21  judgment on the following grounds: declaratory relief that the OPD's 1998 strip search policy was \n22  unconstitutional; declaratory relief that the 2004 amended policy was unconstitutional; judgment that \n23  any search in accordance with either of the policies was unconstitutional; and summary judgment on \n24  the issue of liability in favor of plaintiffs.  The court held the 1998 policy to be unconstitutional \n25  insofar as it allowed physical body cavity searches to be performed by someone other than a medical \n26  professional.  Id. at 18.  The 2004 policy was found to be unconstitutional to the extent it allowed \n27  strip searches of any kind to be performed in the field on less than probable cause.  Id. at 19.  The \n28 \n6 \n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-SI   Document99   Filed12/14/09   Page7 of 18\n1  other parts of plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment were denied.  Plaintiff Young thereafter filed \n2  the instant motion. \n3 \n4  LEGAL STANDARD \n5  Summary judgment may be granted only when, drawing all inferences and resolving all \n6  doubts in favor of the non-moving party, there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving \n7  party is entitled to judgment as a matter oflaw.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); see generally Anderson v. \n8  Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242,247-255 (1986).  A fact is \"material\" ifit may affect the outcome \n9  of the proceedings, and an issue of material fact is \"genuine\" if the evidence is such that a reasonable \nlO  jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party.  !d. at 248.  The court may not make credibility \n... \n11  determinations.  Id. at 255.  The moving party bears the burden of identifying those portions of the \n1=.   \nU.Q..    <'8\"   12  pleadings, discovery and affidavits that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. \n..e \n.... \n.~..  ~  13  Celotex Corp. v.

Young focuses his \n21  arguments on three actions taken by Bergeron: (1) the initial stop of Young on the basis of California \n22  Vehicle Code subsection 26708( a)(2); (2) the arrest of Young on the suspicion he possessed \n23  marijuana; and (3) the alleged strip search ofYoung.2  Bergeron argues that his actions were lawful \n24  and that he is, in any event, protected from liability by the doctrine of qualified immunity. \n25  1.  The Investigatory Stop \n26  Young argues that Bergeron unlawfully stopped his vehicle on the basis of an alleged \n27  violation of California Vehicle Code 26708(a)(2) (\"subsection (a)(2)\").  \"Under the Fourth \n28  Amendment, government officials may conduct an investigatory stop of a vehicle only if they \n7 \n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-SI   Document99   Filed12/14/09   Page8 of 18\n1  possess reasonable suspicion: a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person \n2  stopped of criminal activity.  Such reasonable suspicion requires specific, articulable facts which, \n3  together with objective and reasonable inferences, form a basis for suspecting that a particular person \n4  is engaged in criminal conduct.\"  United States v. Twilley, 222 F.3d 1092, 1095 (9th Cir. 2000) \n5  (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \n6  On February 27,2003, approximately seven months before the incident at issue on this \n7  motion, the California Court of Appeal held a vehicle stop based on the same vehicle code provision \n8  and the same type of air freshener as Young's to have been umeasonable.  People v.  White, 107 Cal. \n9  App. 4th 636 (2003).  In that case, a patrol officer stopped a car with a tree-shaped air freshener \n10  hanging from the rearview mirror.3  Id. at 640-641.  Upon making contact with the driver of the \n...... \n11  vehicle, the officer smelled marijuana and subsequently discovered over five pounds of marijuana \n='\"\"   \nu0   O'\"s   12  and other contraband.  An occupant of the vehicle, White, was convicted oftransporting marijuana in \n......  <8 \n.- :.a \n~ u  13  violation of California law.  He appealed the trial court judge's denial of his suppression motion.  Id. \n..-'.\"..\".   '0- \n.f I.l \n.~  14  at 639-640 . \nt; \n~ \nis \nfI.l  E  15  The Court of Appeal reversed the lower court, holding that reasonable suspicion was lacking. \n..~....  -u=  \n..e..o.:.   t:: \nrJ1  z0   16  The court found that subsection (a)(2) does not flatly prohibit hanging any object from a rearview \nu \n'\"0  -.5..  \n...~.-...   u0. .  17  mirror.  Rather, subsection (a)(2) proscribes the placement of articles in or upon the vehicle which \n= \n~  18  \"obstruct or reduce the driver's clear view through the windshield or side windows.\"  See Cal. Veh. \n19  Code ยง 26708(a)(2).  The officer never testified that he believed the air freshener obstructed the \n20  driver's view.  He also did not testify to specific and articulable facts, like erratic driving, that might \n21  suggest the driver's view was impeded.  Moreover, an expert had testified that the air freshener \n22  covered less that 0.05 percent of the windshield of the car at issue.  Id. at 642.  The court held, \"[o]n \n23  this record,\" that it was not objectively reasonable to believe the air freshener obstructed or reduced \n24  the driver's clear view through the windshield in violation of the vehicle code.  Id. \n25  Bergeron does not dispute Young's contention that his air freshener was the same \n26  \"ubiquitous\" air freshener at issue in White.  According to Young, Bergeron should have known at \n27  the time of the incident with Young that a tree-shaped air freshener hanging from a rearview mirror \n28  cannot be the factual basis for a violation of subsection (a)(2).  Young's reading of White is too \n8 \n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-SI   Document99   Filed12/14/09   Page9 of 18\n1  narrow.4  White rejects a construction of the code section that would flatly prohibit hanging a tree-\n2  shaped air freshener from a rearview mirror; however, it does not adopt the position that such an \n3  item can never provide the basis for a stop.  Aside from Bergeron's very general description of the \n4  air freshener, neither party has submitted evidence pertaining to the size of his windshield, the exact \n5  size of the air freshener or any other factor that would shed light on whether the air freshener reduced \n6  Young's view.  While Bergeron admitted he did not see any moving violation, he testified in his \n7  deposition that Young's car looked as if it had been traveling \"faster than it should have been for \n8  having to stop at a stop sign.\" Whether these facts are sufficiently specific and articulable to support \n9  \"reasonable suspicion\" depends upon the credibility of Bergeron and must be weighed by the finder \n10  of fact rather than decided on summary judgment. \n... \n...  11  II.  The Arrest \n= \nc \nU...   E'\"   12  The parties agree that Bergeron placed Young under arrest at the point Bergeron handcuffed \n<2 \n...~.-...

Ci \n.~r.I.J    E..,   15  Young contends that Bergeron lacked probable cause.  The Fourth Amendment requires that a law \n\" โฌ\n~ \nz0  \nrJJ  16  enforcement officer have \"probable cause\" to arrest an individual without a warrant.  United States v. \n\"..0.   ..'\".;.   \n..~..  ::0... .  17  Jensen, 425 F.3d 698, 704 (9th Cir. 2005), cert. denied, 126 S.Ct. 1664.  \"The test for whether \n= \n~  18  probable cause exists is whether 'at the moment of arrest the facts and circumstances within the \n19  knowledge of the arresting officers and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were \n20  sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that the petitioner had committed or was committing \n21  an offense.'\"  Id. (quoting United States v. Bernard, 623 F.2d 551, 559 (9th Cir. 1980). \"A \n22  determination as to whether probable cause exists requires a practical, common-sense decision based \n23  on the totality ofthe circumstances, including the veracity, basis of knowledge and reliability of the \n24  information provided by informants.\" ld. (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Illinois v. Gates, \n25  462 US. 213, 214 (1983)).  \"Hunches\" or \"gut feelings\" are insufficient to establish reasonable \n26  suspicion, let alone probable cause.  United States v. Johnson, 256 F.3d 895, 905 (9th Cir. 2001) (en \n27  banc). \n28 \n9 \n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-SI   Document99   Filed12/14/09   Page10 of 18\n1  For the purposes of this motion, the court accepts as true Bergeron's testimony that he \n2  smelled a strong scent of fresh marijuana and that he saw crumbs on Young's shirt that looked like \n3  manJuana.  Young objects that Bergeron had no definitive proof that any such crumbs were \n4  manJuana.  He contends that any odor Bergeron smelled, combined with the crumbs, was not enough \n5  to constitute probable cause that Young had committed a crime.  In Young's view, Bergeron merely \n6  had a hunch that Young had large quantities of marijuana. \n7  It must first be noted that Bergeron was not required to have probable cause to suspect Young \n8  had \"large quantities\" of marijuana, as Young's counsel repeatedly characterizes the inquiry.  A more \n9  proper question is whether Bergeron had probable cause to believe Young had enough marijuana to \n10  violate the law.  A second important question is whether at the time of the arrest Bergeron believed \n...... \na..  11  he had probable cause to arrest Young for a felony or only a misdemeanor, which is a citable offense \n= \n0  '\"  12  under California Penal Code section 853.6.  An odor, by itself, can be the basis for probable cause if \nU  E \n.........   S \nCJ  \"u'   13  the affiant is qualified to know the odor and it is one sufficiently distinctive to identifY a forbidden \na.. \n......  '\"\" \n....  0 \nQt'I l  .~< .>   14  substance.  See United States. v. DeLeon, 979 F.2d 761,765 (9th Cir. 1992) (citing Johnson v. \ni:5 \nt'Il \n..Q...;.j   \"E   15  United States, 333 U.S. 10, 13 (1948)).  Bergeron has been a sworn peace officer since 1990 and \n..c.:.t.:.I   โฌ \n00  z.0,    16  spent approximately three years assigned to OPD's Vice Nareotics Unit prior to the incident with \n\"'0  -5 \n....Q....;..j    u2..;   17  Young.  Bergeron Depo. at 5.  Bergeron and the two other officers who were on the scene have \n= \n~  18  testified that they smelled marijuana.  Young has not challenged the respective qualifications of any \n19  ofthese police officers to recognize the scent of fresh marijuana.  Drawing inferences in favor of the \n20  non-moving party, the court must conclude that the officers were qualified to recognize the distinct \n21  odor of marijuana. \n22  Young's assertions that Bergeron arrested him simply on a \"hunch\" are unpersuasive. \n23  Bergeron was confronted with the strong evidence of his senses, not simply a gut feeling.  The strong \n24  scent of fresh marijuana coupled with the sight of a substance the officer believed to be marijuana \n25  warranted the belief that Young had committed or was committing an offense.  But, if Bergeron did \n26  not have probable cause to arrest Young for a felony rather than a citable misdemeanor, the extent of \n27  the search of Young's person conducted thereafter may be affected.  It would appear on the facts in \n28  this record that Bergeron did not have probable cause to arrest for a felony since the only evidence he \n10 \n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-SI   Document99   Filed12/14/09   Page11 of 18\n1  had was the collection of crumbs found on Young.  Although the parties have stipulated this was an \n2  arrest, the facts suggest that it was more likely a detention.  Nonetheless, this presents other problems \n3  with the validity of the strip search.  Without full development of the facts at trial the court cannot \n4  determine whether the seizure was an arrest or detention. \n5  III.  The Strip Search \n6  Finally, Young argues that Bergeron conducted an unlawful strip search ofhim.5  This court's \n7  March 2008 order used the definition of \"strip search\" provided in section 4030(c) of the California \n8  Penal Code, which defines \"strip search\" as \"a search which requires a person to remove or arrange \n9  some or all of his or her clothing so as to permit a visual inspection of the underclothing, breasts, \n10  buttocks, or genitalia of such person.\"  March 2008 Order at 11; see Cal. Penal Code ยง 4030(c ). \n... \nr..  11  Defendant Bergeron now urges that this definition is too broad.6  According to Bergeron, simply \n= \nU.0..    'ยง'\"   12  pulling back Young's pants, but not his underwear, to visually inspect inside his pants does not \n.. .ยง.  \n.~..  ;u;,;   13  constitute a \"strip search\" and should not be subject to the Fourth Amendment test for \nr.. \n0 \nโข!;โขI.l   ',t>5   14  constitutionality of strip searches in the field.  According to Bergeron, the sort of search he \nQ  '\" \n...  0 \n!;I.l \n.~..  E'\"   15  performed on Young is \"minimally intrusive,\" indeed in some ways even less intrusive than a pat \nโฌ \n~ \nz0  \n00  .s  16  down search.  Bergeron relies upon a recent California Court of Appeal case.  See People v. Smith, \n\".'.0.  \n..  ::; \n~ \"- 17  172 Cal. App. 4th 1354 (2009).  In that case, criminal defendant Smith appealed denial of a \n= \n~  18  suppression motion, arguing he was subject to an unconstitutional strip search.  On patrol, the \n19  officers in that case had spotted a man trying to open the window of a hotel room in a high-crime \n20  neighborhood.  They then saw a second man, Smith, sitting in the driver's seat of a car parked \n21  directly in front of the same hotel room.  An officer approached Smith and asked ifhe was on parole. \n22  Smith answered in the affirmative and gave permission for the officers to search his car.  The officers \n23  conducted a pat-down search of Smith and a thorough search of his car, and found no contraband. \n24  Because of the high incidence of drug activity in the area, Smith's own history of selling drugs, and \n25  the officers own \"feeling\" Smith had contraband in his underwear, one ofthe officers removed \n26  Smith's belt, unzipped his pants, pulled them down \"a foot or so,\" and pulled the elastic waistband \n27  out away from Smith's body.  Tho officer saw a large bag the size of a baseball sitting \"right on top \n28 \n11 \n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-SI   Document99   Filed12/14/09   Page12 of 18\n1  of his penis.,,7  The officer retrieved the bag, which contained several smaller baggies of heroin, \n2  cocaine and methamphetamine.  Id. at 1357-1358. \n3  The court held the search to have been reasonable, relying heavily on the fact that Smith was \n4  a parolee.  See id. at 1360 (\"Here, this analysis turns on Smith's status as a parolee.\"), 1363 (\"We \n5  agree with the trial court's conclusion that Smith was not SUbjected to a public strip search ..... We \n6  deem the intrusiveness of the search even less significant in light of our conclusion that Smith had a \n7  sharply diminished expectation of privacy as a parolee.\").  For this reason, Smith is inapposite to the \n8  instant case, where Young was not on probation or parole and the officers knew nothing about any \n9  drug-related activities of Young.  Furthermore, the Smith court found that the officers had taken steps \n10  such as conducting the search \"in an area that did not face the street, was fenced-off on at least one \n..:.......   11  side, and was not heavily frequented.\"  Id. at 1363.  The officers also placed Smith inside the crook \n= \n0  '\"  12  between the door ofthe patrol car and the body of the car, and stood around him to obstruct \nU  E \n......  @ \n.~- -u.;   13  visibility.  Id.  Bergeron does not contend that he took any of these steps.  Finally, it is worth noting \n..:.......   --\n.- 0 \ntll \n.~  14  that the sequence of Bergeron's search differed markedly from the Smith search.  Believing that \nQ \n0 \ntll \n..~....  <E>   15  Smith had contraband, the officers first patted down Smith and throughly searched his vehicle.  It \n.c \n..C...I.:   1:: \nrJ1  ;.z0, ;   16  was only when they were unable to find contraband in any other location that they concluded any \n\"'CI  -.5..  \n...~.-...  \"0-  17  contraband Smith had must be stashed in his underwear.  In the instant case, Bergeron believed that \n= \n~  18  there was fresh marijuana either in Young's car or on Young's person.  Bergeron Depo. at 30.  Yet \n19  Bergeron searched Young's underwear before the search of the car was completed.  Id. at 58-59.  In \n20  short, even if Smith were controlling, it would be distinguishable on its facts.  Although the Smith \n21  court couched the question rhetorically as a definitional one-i.e., was Smith subjected to a \"strip \n22  search\"?-the inquiry undertaken by the court was actually a substantive analysis of whether the \n23  specific circumstances in that case amounted to a Fourth Amendment violation.  The case did not \n24  tum on the issue of whether the nomenclature of \"strip search\" applied. \n25  Neither do the federal cases relied upon by Smith support Bergeron's assertion that the search \n26  of Young was not a \"strip search\" and was therefore permissible under the Fourth Amendment.  In \n27  United States v.  Williams, 477 F.3d 974 (8th Cir. 2007), the officers had obtained a search warrant \n28  for the suspect's home.  After observing the suspect, Williams, drive away from his home, the \n12 \n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-SI   Document99   Filed12/14/09   Page13 of 18\n1  officers conducted a traffic stop.  A pat-down search revealed something in Williams's pants.  The. \n2  officers took Williams into custody, placed him in a squad car, and drove him several blocks to the \n3  police department's precinct building.  They searched Williams in the parking lot and reached into \n4  his underwear to retrieve a large amount of crack and cocaine near his genitals.  Id. at 975.  The court \n5  did not consider this search to be a \"full-blown strip search\" and found the search to be reasonable \n6  under the circumstances.  !d. at 976.  While instructive, this case is inapposite because the pat-down \n7  search had given the officers reason to believe that Williams had hidden contraband in his \n8  underwear.  Moreover, the court found that the officers had taken a number of effective steps to \n9  protect Williams's privacy.  See id. at 977.  Similarly, the officer in United States v. Ashley, 37 F.3d \n10  678 (D.C. Cir. 1994), had proceeded to open the suspect's pants only after feeling an object his \n..-.....   11  training indicated was a bag of crack cocaine during a pat-down search.  Id. at 679-680.  Bergeron \n= \nQ  .'ยง\"   12  cites these cases for the proposition that a \"reach in\" or a visual inspection of the underwear is not a \nU \n.-\n......  @ \n-C..i   -u;;   13  \"strip search.\" Yet the result of neither case turns on the terminology employed. \n.- ..... \n...... \n0 \nfI.l \n\"E:  14  Bergeron provides no support, either in the form of evidence or legal authority, to buttress his \n~ at;  \nfI.l \n..Q..,.,.}   .E,   15  contention that a person would ordinarily find a visual search of undergarments to be less intrusive \n' โฌ\n..~....  \nz0  \nr.F.l  16  than a pat-down search.  In summary, there is no reason for this court to conclude that a visual \nOJ \n.\"'-0  -5 \n..Q..,.,.}   \"5\"   17  inspection of Young's underwear was not a \"strip search,\" a conclusion which would conflict with \n= \n~  18  the definition of the phrase found not only in California Penal Code section 4030(C )8 but also the \n19  OPD's own policy in place in 2003. \n20  The next question is whether the strip search of Young violated his Fourth Amendment right \n21  to be free of unreasonable search and seizure.  The constitutionality ofa search is assessed by \n22  balancing the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search \n23  entails.  This requires the court to weigh the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it \n24  is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.  Way v. County \n25  a/Ventura, 445 F.3d 1157,1160 (9th Cir. 2006) (quoting Bell v.  Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979)). \n26  \"The test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or \n27  mechanical application.  In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search \n28  against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails.\" Bell, 441 U.S. at 559. \n13 \n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-SI   Document99   Filed12/14/09   Page14 of 18\n1  Based on a detailed review of the case law concerning strip searches and body cavity \n2  searches, this court articulated Fourth Amendment requirements for strip searches in the field, in the \n3  context of determining whether a given police department policy is constitutional.  Because the \n4  Fourth Amendment test is not a bright line rule, this list is non-exhaustive when applied to questions \n5  of liability arising out of particular incidents; other factors must be considered as appropriate to the \n6  individual circumstances.  In order to justify a strip search in the field: (1) there must be exigent \n7  circumstances; (2) the search may only be performed on persons who have been lawfully arrested on \n8  probable cause and may not be performed on anyone for whom there is no probable cause to arrest; \n9  (3) the search requires probable cause that is independent of the probable cause found for the arrest; \n10  and (4) the search may only be performed when there is probable cause to believe that the arrestee is \n..... \n1]  in possession of weapons, drugs or dangerous contraband.  Order of March 2008 at 15 (and \nI=...   \nU0   'E'\"   12  authorities cited therein). \n.....  <B \n.-\nCj  ~w   13  In the instant case, Bergeron does not even attempt to argue in his opposition that the strip \n..I......   \"\"' \n.....  0 \nI:IJ  .~  14  search of Young met these requirements.  Bergeron does not assert that exigent circumstances \n.b \n~ '\" \ni5 \nI:IJ \n..Q..,.)   E  15  obtained, and indeed it is difficult to imagine how Young would have ingested, hidden or destroyed \n..<c'.:)  \n..C..!:.I   1:: \n0 \n00  Z  16  any narcotics in his underwear while securely handcuffed in the back of the squad car.  Nor does \n'\" \n\"0  -5 \n...Q-..,.)   t5 \n\"\"  17  Bergeron point to any genuine issue of material fact regarding independent probable cause to strip \n= \n~  18  search Young.  There is no evidence that Bergeron had reason to believe Young was secreting \n19  marijuana in his underwear, other than a hunch or a gut feeling.  Bergeron has testified that he saw \n20  Young make \"furtive movements\" inside the vehicle before Bergeron approached the car, but this \n21  statement lacks specificity and is partially contradicted by Bergeron's deposition testimony that he \n22  never saw Young trying to destroy marijuana.9  Bergeron Depo. at 38.  This is insufficient to create a \n23  genuine issue of fact.  Moreover, Bergeron himself testified that the smell of marijuana emanated \n24  either from Young's car or from Young.  As noted, Bergeron searched Young before completing the \n25  search of the car, undermining the assertion that Bergeron had some specific reason to believe the \n26  marijuana must be on Young's person, as opposed to lying undiscovered in the car. \n27  The manner in which the search was performed, with apparent disregard for any privacy \n28  interest of the suspect also points to the umeasonableness ofthe search.  Unlike officers in cases like \n14 \n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-SI   Document99   Filed12/14/09   Page15 of 18\n1  Williams, Bergeron did not take any steps to protect Young's privacy such as taking Young to a \n2  private location or even searching him in the crook of the car door.  Bergeron instead pulled out \n3  Young's pants and looked into them in the middle of the street. \n4  In summary, Bergeron has raised no genuine issue of material fact that exigent circumstances \n5  obtained or that independent probable cause existed to believe Young was hiding drugs in his \n6  underwear.  Nor has he provided evidence that any steps were taken to protect Young's privacy or \n7  pointed to any other factors specific to this case that weigh against a finding of a Fourth Amendment \n8  violation.  Even accepting Bergeron's version of the events as true, the search conducted on Young \n9  violated Young's Fourth Amendment rights. \n10  IV.  Qualified Immunity \n.. \n.... \n11  Even if a law enforcement officer violates an individual's constitutional rights, the officer \n= \n0  '\"  12  may be protected by the doctrine of qualified immunity.  Qualified immunity shields a public official \nU  E \n......   .s \n... \nii \n..~..  u  13  from individual liability for civil damages under 42 US.C. section 1983 so long as his conduct does \n...  \"'\"' \n0 \nr.Il  .~  14  not \"violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would \n!:l \n~ on \n0 \n..r..I.l  \nQj  E...   15  have known.\" Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 US. 800, 818 (1982).  \"Qualified immunity balances two \n....  ' โฌ\n~ \n0 \n00  Z  16  important interests~-the need to hold public officials accountable when they exercise power \n'\" \n\"....'.0..    -.5...  \nQj  u0.   17  irresponsibly and the need to shield officials from harassment, distraction, and liability when they \n= \n~  18  perform their duties reasonably.  The protection of qualified immunity applies regardless of whether \n19  the government official's error is a mistake of law, a mistake of fact, or a mistake based on mixed \n20  questions of law and fact.\"  Pearson v. Callahan, _  U.S. _, _, 129 S.Ct. 808, 815 (2009) \n21  (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  Qualified immunity \"provides ample protection to \n22  all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\" Malley v. Briggs, 475 US. \n23  335,341 (1986).  As qualified immunity provides immunity from suit and is not merely a defense to \n24  liability, it is important to \"resolv[ e] immunity questions at the earliest possible stage in litigation.\" \n25  See Hunter v. Blyant, 502 U.S. 224,227 (1991). \n26  In Saucier v. Katz, 533 US. 194 (2001), the Supreme Court articulated an inquiry for \n27  determining whether qualified immunity is appropriate.  For an official to benefit from qualified \n28  immunity, two requirements must be met.  First, the court must determine whether, taken in the light \n15 \n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-SI   Document99   Filed12/14/09   Page16 of 18\n1  most favorable to the party asserting the injury, the facts alleged show the officer's conduct violated \n2  a constitutional right.  Id. at 201.  Second, the court must consider whether any constitutional right \n3  that was violated was so clearly established that a reasonable officer would understand that what he \n4  is doing violates that right.  Id. at 202.  The second inquiry is particularized, as it occurs in the \n5  specific context of the situation confronted by the official.  Id.; see also Rudebusch v. Hughes, 313 \n6  F.3d 506, 514 (9th Cif. 2002).  The Saucier inquiry articulated the first question as a threshold \n7  question; however the Court recently held that lower courts may \"exercise their sound discretion in \n8  deciding which of the two prongs of the qualified immunity analysis should be addressed first in \n9  light of the circumstances in the particular case at hand.\" Pearson, 129 S.Ct. at 818. \n10  Bergeron points out that this court recognized in March 2008 \"What is not clear is the extent \n...... \n11  to which a strip search may be conducted in the field.\"  See March 2008 Order at 14.  Indeed, as the \n=J,..   \nU.Q..    'ยงc:!   12  court noted, there has been very little case law both on strip searches in the field and on the \n@ \n.-\n.C..J   \"uiii   13  requirements for performing strip searches that do not rise to the level of physical or visual body \nJ,..

While the Ninth Circuit has had occasion to determine the constitutionality of \n!:l \n~ \"' \n...  i5 \n.r~..f..!   ..t.:,.:.    15  various strip search policies, those cases dealt with blanket strip searches conducted at a police \nโฌ \n~ \nz0  \n00  .,  16  station or other detention facility.  See, e.g., Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614 (9th Cif. 1984) \n\"C  ;.S...  \n...~.-...  0  17  (holding unconstitutional pre-booking search of arrestee for minor traffic violation conducted \n~ \nc \n;J \n18  pursuant to blanket strip search policy), overruled on other grounds by, Hodgers-Durgin v. de la \n19  Vina, 199 F.3d 1037, 1040 n.l (9th Cif. 1999); Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police Dep 't, 901 F.2d 702 \n20  (9th Cir. 1990) (holding unconstitutional city's blanket policy of performing visual body cavity \n21  searches on all felony arrestees), overruling on other grounds recognized in, Act Up!/Portland v. \n22  Bagley, 971 F.2d 298, 301 (9th Cif. 1992); Fuller v. M.G. Jewelry, 950 F.2d 1437 (9th Cir. 1991) \n23  (holding unconstitutional strip search at police station pursuant to blanket policy). \n24  Bergeron argues that ifthe parameters of a permissible strip search in the field were not yet \n25  established in 2008, they could not have been clearly established in the mind of a reasonable police \n26  officer in 2003.  Young contends that Bergeron should have known that the conditions for \n27  conducting a strip search on the street are logically more stringent than those for conducting a strip \n28  search in ajail facility.  Young also argues that Bergeron was on notice that his actions were \n16 \n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-SI   Document99   Filed12/14/09   Page17 of 18\n1  unconstitutional because they violated the OPD's own strip search policy.  Where a police \n2  department has articulated an institutional policy pertaining to a practice, such policy is a factor in \n3  determining both whether the officer acted reasonably and whether he was on notice that actions \n4  transgressing the policy violated an established right.  See Drummond v. City ofA  naheim, 343 F.3d \n5  1052, 1061-1062 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding police department training materials' discussion of danger \n6  of compression asphyxia relevant to both reasonableness and notice practice was unconstitutional); \n7  Headwaters Forest Defense v. County of Humboldt, 276 F.3d 1125, 1] 31 (9th Cir. 2002) (holding \n8  right clearly established in part through regional and state-wide police practice).  Bergeron plainly \n9  violated the OPD's policy regarding strip searches insofar as he did not ultimately book Young and \n- 10  did not conduct the search in a private area where the search could not be observed by persons not \n11  participating in the search.1O  Furthermore, despite the agreement ofthe parties, it is not clear on the \n=J.  \n-\n0  ro  12  record before the court whether the seizure of Young can be characterized as an arrest. \nU  \"ยง \n-\"E \n:.a \n.s~:  u  13  This is not the sort of case in which qualified immunity has been, or could have been, \n.- '0- \nrL:l  ,~  14  successfully invoked early in the litigation.

Plaintiff's motion is in all other respects DENIED.  Remaining \n22  issues concerning the investigatory stop and arrest, qualified immunity, and any damages that may be \n23  due to plaintiff cannot be adjudicated on this summary judgment motion. \n24 \n25  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n&t.  1 \nIt \n~:  ~ \nDated: \n28 \n17 \n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-SI   Document99   Filed12/14/09   Page18 of 18\n1  ENDNOTES \n2  1.  Unless otherwise indicated, all references to docket numbers refer to the docket in Case No. \nC 04-4843. \n3 \n2.  Plaintiff does not challenge the constitutionality of the search of his vehicle. \n4 \n3.  In White, the officer also cited a second, independent ground for stopping the vehicle: the absence \n5  of a front licence plate. The car was licensed in Arizona, a state that issues only a rear license plate. The \ncourt found that California law did not require a front license plate for a car registered in another state \n6  when that state did not require a front plate.  107 Cal. App. 4th at 643.  The court also held there to be \nno good faith exception to the exclusionary rule for police who enforce a legal standard that does not \n7  exist.  Id. at 644. \n8  4.  Indeed, a later California Court of Appeal case, again addressing the same section ofthe vehicle \ncode and the same Ubiquitous tree-shaped air freshener, distinguished White and denied a suppression \n9  motion. People v. Colbert, 157 Cal. App. 4th 1068 (2007). As Young notes, Colbert is irrelevant to the \nquestion ofw  hether Bergeron reasonably thought he could stop Young in 2003. Yet the case is relevant, \n10  as persuasive authority, to the question whether such a stop violates the Fourth Amendment at all. \n.. \n...... \n11  5.  To be clear, Young does not contest the pat-down search but rather the portion of the search \n= \ninvolving the rearrangement of his clothing. As to the latter portion of the search, Bergeron and Young \nu0  \"'s\"   12  have differing recollections of the invasiveness and duration of the search.  As noted, Bergeron's \n.....-....   :@  testimony is accepted as true for the purposes of Young's motion for summary judgment. \n~ C:..5>   13 \n....-...  40-  6.  The court relied in part upon Edgerly v. City & County ofS an Francisco, 495 F.3d 645 (9th Cir. \nrIl \n.~  14  2007), which had discussed the California definition approvingly. See id. at 656. Inexplicably, counsel \n~ \ni5  for Bergeron failed to point out in their opposition that the Edgerly opinion has since been withdrawn \nrIl \n..~....   E\"   15  pending rehearing by the panel. See Edgerlyv. City & County ofS an Francisco, 527 F.3d 841 (9th Cir. \n=:  โฌ \n......  2008) (granting panel rehearing and withdrawing earlier opinion). \n0 \n00  Z  16 \n\" \n\"0  -S  7.  The opinion does not indicate how the pat-down failed to reveal the baseball-sized object in \n...~.-...   u0.   17  Smith's underwear. \n= \n~  18  8.  The definition found at California Penal Code section 4030 was enacted before 2003. \n19  9.  \"The general rule in the Ninth Circuit is that a party cannot create an issue of fact by an affidavit \ncontradicting his prior deposition testimony.\" Kennedy v. Allied Mut. Ins. Co., 952 F.2d 262, 266 (9th \n20  Cir. 1991).  There is even more reason to disregard an affidavit that has been contradicted by later \ndeposition testimony.  Young has objected to the two Bergeron declarations filed by defendant. To the \n21  extent that these declarations contradict Bergeron's deposition testimony, the obj ection is SUSTAINED. \nThe court also SUSTAINS Young's objection to the admission of the unsworn recorded interview of \n22  Leron Habebullah.  This interview was not taken under oath, and Bergeron has not indicated that \nHabebullah is unavailable for the purposes of filing a declaration or being deposed. \n23 \n10.  The Citizens' Police Review Board and the OPD Internal Affairs Division also found that \n24  Bergeron violated the policy.  See Haddad Dec., Exhs. F & G. \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n18 ",

Plaintiffs allege that defendants violated plaintiffsโ constitutional rights through a policy\nr\nu\no a 12 and practice of performing strip searches and body-cavity searches in public.  Plaintiffs seek both\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 injunctive relief and damages.  This case, Foster v. City of Oakland, Case No. C 05-3110 MHP, has\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 been related to eight similar cases pending in the Northern District of California, and this order\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 applies to each of them.1  Now before the court is plaintiffsโ renewed motion for class certification. \nS N 16 After considering the partiesโ arguments and submissions and for the reasons set forth below, the\nted  For the  17 court enters the following memorandum and order.\ni\nn\nU\n18\n19 BACKGROUND\n20 I. The Parties\n21 A. Plaintiffs\n22 The plaintiffs in Foster and each of the eight related cases allege that they have suffered\n23 injuries to their civil rights as a result of strip searches, visual body cavity searches, or physical body\n24 cavity searches administered in public by Oakland police officers at some time between August 1,\n25 2003, and the present.  A detailed description of the allegations of Foster, Duarte, and Young may be\n26 found in the courtโs March 27, 2008, order partially granting and partially denying plaintiffsโ partial\n27 motion for summary judgment.  See Docket No. 63 at 2-5.  The total number of named plaintiffs in\n28 the nine cases is forty.  In addition, plaintiffs state that there are eleven class members who they\n3\n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-MHP   Document79    Filed01/13/09   Page4 of 12\n1 have identified but not yet named.  Mot. at 10.2  One of the forty named plaintiffs, James Taylor (No.\n2 C 04-4843 MHP), filed suit based upon a search that occurred in November 2002, about one year\n3 prior to the period included in the class definition.  Of the thirty-nine remaining named plaintiffs,\n4 thirty-eight identify themselves as African-American and one (Duarte) identifies himself as Latino.  \n5\n6 B. Defendants\n7 Defendant Oakland is a municipal corporation that, among other things, operates the Oakland\n8 Police Department (โOPDโ) and employs the other defendants.  Plaintiffs have variously named\n9 current Chief of Police Wayne Tucker in his official capacity, former Chief of Police Richard Word\n10 in both his individual and official capacities, and numerous individual Oakland police officers in\nt 11 both their individual and official capacities.\nr\nu\no a 12\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 II.

See id.  These groups overlap with one another: some plaintiffs allege\ni\nn\nU\n18 they were subjected to just one type of search, while others allege they were subjected to two or\n19 even all three of the different search techniques.  See id.  The โtype of searchโ conducted on each\n20 plaintiff varies from plaintiff to plaintiff.  The various types include: โunlawful detention,โ โvisible\n21 public strip search,โ โmanipulation of testicles,โ โmanipulation of genital cavity,โ โmanipulation of\n22 anal cavity,โ โanal cavity penetration,โ and combinations of these types.  See Sherwin Dec., Exh. A. \n23 Some but not all of the plaintiffs had outstanding warrants for their arrest at the time they were\n24 subjected to search.  Some but not all were on probation or parole and it remains to be determined\n25 whether the detaining officers knew whether the subjects were on probation or parole.  Numerous\n26 officers are alleged to have been involved in the various strip searches, but no single officer was\n27 involved in all or even most of the searches.  See id.4  \n28\n4\n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-MHP   Document79    Filed01/13/09   Page5 of 12\n1 III. Relevant Procedural History\n2 Plaintiffs Foster and Duarte filed the present action on August 1, 2005.  Pursuant to\n3 stipulations, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on September 22, 2005, adding plaintiff Young. \n4 Plaintiffsโ motion to certify a class was denied on January 27, 2007, for failure to satisfy the\n5 requirement of numerosity.  Docket No. 42 (โJanuary 2007 Orderโ).  At that time, there were three\n6 related cases,5 and plaintiffs had identified sixteen potential class members, almost all of whom lived\n7 in Oakland.  \n8 On March 27, 2008, the court partially granted and partially denied plaintiffsโ partial motion\n9 for summary judgment.  Docket No. 63 (โMarch 2008 MSJ Orderโ).  Plaintiffs moved for partial\n10 summary judgment on the following grounds: declaratory relief that the OPDโs 1998 strip search\nt 11 policy was unconstitutional; declaratory relief that the 2004 amended policy was unconstitutional;\nr\nu\no a 12 judgment that any search in accordance with either of the policies was unconstitutional; and\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 summary judgment on the issue of liability in favor of plaintiffs.6  The court held the 1998 policy to\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 be unconstitutional insofar as it allowed physical body cavity searches to be performed by someone\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 other than a medical professional.  Id. at 18.  The 2004 policy was found to be unconstitutional to the\nS N 16 extent that it allowed strip searches of any kind to be performed in the field on less than probable\nted  For the  17 cause.  Id. at 19.  The other parts of plaintiffsโ motion for summary judgment were denied.  \ni\nn\nU\n18 On September 9, 2008, plaintiffs filed the instant renewed motion for class certification. \n19 Since the courtโs denial of plaintiffsโ motion to certify a class in January 2007, five new cases have\n20 been related to this case,7 bringing the total number of named plaintiffs meeting plaintiffsโ proposed\n21 class definition to thirty-nine.  \n22\n23 LEGAL STANDARD\n24 A class may be certified in a case that meets the four prerequisites enumerated in Rule 23(a)\n25 and at least one of the requirements of Rule 23(b).  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.  Under Rule 23(a), the party\n26 seeking class certification must establish numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of\n27 representation.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  In addition to the explicit requirements set out by Rule 23(a),\n28\n5\n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-MHP   Document79    Filed01/13/09   Page6 of 12\n1 the class definition must set forth a class which is adequately defined and clearly ascertainable.  See\n2 DeBremaecker v. Short, 433 F.2d 733, 734 (5th Cir. 1970).  \n3 The party seeking class certification bears the burden of establishing that the requirements of\n4 Rule 23(a) and (b) have been met.  Zinser v. Accufix Research Inst., 253 F.3d 1180, 1186 (9th Cir.\n5 2001), amended by 273 F.3d 1266 (9th Cir. 2001); Hanon v. Dataproducts Corp., 976 F.2d 497, 508\n6 (9th Cir. 1992).  When adjudicating a motion for class certification, the court accepts the allegations\n7 in the complaint as true so long as those allegations are sufficiently specific to permit an informed\n8 assessment as to whether the requirements of Rule 23 have been satisfied.  Blackie v. Barrack, 524\n9 F.2d 891, 901 (9th Cir. 1975).  The merits of the class membersโ substantive claims are generally\n10 irrelevant to this inquiry.  Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 177-78 (1974); see also\nt 11 Moore v. Hughes Helicopters, Inc., 708 F.2d 475, 480 (9th Cir. 1983). \nr\nu\no a 12\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 DISCUSSION\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 A proposed class cannot be certified unless it meets all four prerequisites of Rule 23(a), and\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 meets at least one requirement of Rule 23(b).   \nS N 16\nted  For the  17 I. Rule 23(a) Numerosity\ni\nn\nU\n18 When plaintiffs brought their first motion to certify, their proposed class did not meet the\n19 numerosity requirement.  Five additional cases have been filed since that time.  Plaintiffs note that\n20 there are now thirty-nine named plaintiffs who would meet the class definition and further assert that\n21 there are eleven more persons who have not yet been named.  The numerosity requirement states that\n22 a class action is appropriate โonly if the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is\n23 impracticable.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1).  Both plaintiffs and defendants, as well as this court, have\n24 taken note of one treatiseโs observation that โ[a] class of 41 or more is usually sufficiently\n25 numerous.โ  Mooreโs Federal Practice ยง 23.22[1][b]; see January 2007 Order at 8; Mot. at 10; Opp.\n26 at 17.  However, there is no magic number.  The number of potential class members needed to\n27 establish numerosity varies with other factors, such as geographical dispersion and the difficulty in\n28 identifying class members.  See Moeller v. Taco Bell, 220 F.R.D. 604, 608 (N.D. Cal. 2004)\n6\n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-MHP   Document79    Filed01/13/09   Page7 of 12\n1 (Jenkins, J.); Mooreโs Federal Practice ยง 23.22[1][a] (noting that no single factor controls); see also\n2 Allen v. Isaac, 99 F.R.D. 45 (N.D. Ill. 1983) (deciding that class of 17 satisfied numerosity\n3 requirement); Joshlin v. Gannett River States Publโg Corp., 152 F.R.D. 577, 579 (E.D. Ark. 1993)\n4 (deciding that class of 95 failed to satisfy numerosity requirement).\n5 Plaintiffs also propose certification of four subclasses.  When appropriate, a class may be\n6 divided into subclasses that are each treated as a class.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(5).  Yet each subclass\n7 โmust independently meet the requirements of Rule 23 for the maintenance of a class action.โ  Estate\n8 of Felts v. Genworth Life Ins. Co., 250 F.R.D. 512 (W.D. Wa. 2008), quoting Betts v. Reliable\n9 Collection Agency, Ltd., 659 F.2d 1000, 1005 (9th Cir. 1981).  The court must, then, determine not\n10 only whether the numerosity requirement is met for the overall class, but whether each subclass\nt 11 meets the requirement.  \nr\nu\no a 12 Including the as-of-yet unnamed individuals, the number of individuals so far identified as\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 potential members of each class and subclass are as follows:\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 C Class: 50 individuals (39 named plaintiffs plus 11 other identified individuals);\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 C Subclass (a) (strip searches): 50 individuals;\nS N 16 C Subclass (b) (visual body cavity searches): 12 individuals;\nted  For the  17 C Subclass (c) (physical body cavity searches): 13 individuals; and\ni\nn\nU\n18 C Subclass (d) (race or national origin): 39 named plaintiffs plus some unspecified \n19 number of individuals identified but not yet named.8\n20  The claims of each plaintiff involve events that occurred in Oakland, so the potential for\n21 geographic dispersion is low.  There does not seem to be any particular difficulty in identifying\n22 individuals with similar claims, since they have continued to come forward at a relatively steady\n23 pace.  The nature of the alleged offense distinguishes it from the sort of situation in which an\n24 individual may not know that his rights have potentially been violated.  Based on the specific factors\n25 of this case, neither the proposed class nor any of the proposed subclasses meet the Rule 23(a)\n26 numerosity prerequisite.  For this reason alone, the instant motion should be denied.  Lest plaintiffs\n27 interpret this finding as an invitation to file a third request for class certification in the event that\n28\n7\n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-MHP   Document79    Filed01/13/09   Page8 of 12\n1 more plaintiffs come forward, it is useful to note that the requirements of Rule 23(b) are not met\n2 either.  \n3\n4 II. Rule 23(b)\n5 To be certified, a class definition must meet at least one of Rule 23(b)โs enumerated\n6 requirements.  As explained below, none are met in this case.  \n7\n8 A. Rule 23(b)(1) \n9 A class action may be certified under Rule 23(b)(1) if the prosecution of separate actions\n10 would have the effect of establishing incompatible standards of conduct for the opposing party or if\nt 11 separate actions would impair individual class membersโ interests.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1); see\nr\nu\no a 12 generally Wright & Miller, Civil Practice & Procedure, ยงยง 1773 & 1774.  In this case, there is no\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 danger of either.  By its nature, any standard of conduct set forth for the OPD and its officers will be\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 a standard of general applicability.  The individual right to be free from unlawful strip searches does\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 not vary from person to person.  Plaintiffs raise the specter of multiple courts issuing conflicting\nS N 16 injunctions.  There is no real danger of such occurring in this case.  All incidents at issue have\nted  For the  17 occurred in Oakland, and every action has been filed in the Northern District of California and been\ni\nn\nU\n18 related to the others.  Hypothetically, some related claims could be filed in state court, and the state\n19 and federal courts could issue conflicting injunctions.  Such a possibility exists regardless of whether\n20 or not this action is treated on a class action basis.  There is, in this case, no real danger of\n21 establishing incompatible standards of conduct.\n22 Neither is there a concern that separate actions would impair individual class membersโ\n23 interests.  The individual claims arise from very different individual factual circumstances.  This is\n24 not an instance in which the disposition of one plaintiffโs case will in some way impair the ability of\n25 other plaintiffs to protect their interests.  Classes are typically certified under Rule 23(b)(1)(B) when\n26 a common fund of a limited amount exists to settle claims and the separate adjudication of claims\n27 may leave those plaintiffs who later establish a right to payment with no funds left to satisfy that\n28 right.  See, e.g., In re Drexel Burnham Group, 960 F.2d 285, 292 (2d Cir. 1992) (certifying class\n8\n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-MHP   Document79    Filed01/13/09   Page9 of 12\n1 where limited amount of funds was available to pay victims).  Cases not involving a common fund\n2 but rather some other common interest have been found to merit class treatment in accordance with\n3 this rule.  See, e.g., Robertson v. Natโl Basketball Assโn, 556 F.2d 682, 685 (2d Cir. 1977)\n4 (certifying class in antitrust suit where preventing merger of two competing basketball leagues\n5 would affect interests of all professional basketball players).  A judgment for one plaintiff against\n6 the City of Oakland would not affect a different plaintiffโs ability to collect on his own judgment.  \n7\n8 B.   Rule 23(b)(2)\n9 This rule is limited to cases in which โfinal injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory\n10 relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  Legal remedies\nt 11 which are incidental to a request for injunctive relief may be included as a part of the claim. \nr\nu\no a 12 Williams v. Owens-Illinois, Inc., 665 F.2d 918, 928 (9th Cir. 1982); see also Moeller, 220 F.R.D. at\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 610 (certifying class where the plaintiffs sought, in addition to injunctive relief, minimal statutory\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 damages to which they were entitled without proof of actual injury).  The Foster plaintiffs and\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 plaintiffs in the related actions pray for substantial sums.  The Foster plaintiffs have asked for $1\nS N 16 million each in general damagesโplus special damages, punitive damages, attorneysโ fees, and\nted  For the  17 costs.  See FAC at 17-18.  There is no dispute that injunctive relief is important to plaintiffs, but the\ni\nn\nU\n18 request for damages is quite important as well.  In any event, damages are not incidental, and the\n19 determination of damages would require the sort of individualized proof not contemplated in a class\n20 certified under this rule, which unlike Rule 23(b)(3) does not contain an opt-out provision.   \n21 Furthermore, class treatment is unnecessary to provide injunctive relief that would protect\n22 the rights of the class as a whole.  A grant of injunctive relief to one plaintiff that alters OPDโs\n23 policies and practices would protect all purported class members.  \n24\n25 C. Rule 23(b)(3)\n26 Class certification pursuant to this rule requires that the court determine โthat the questions\n27 of law or fact common to the class members predominate . . .โ and that a class action is โsuperior to\n28 other available methodsโ for fairly adjudicating the controversy.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). \n9\n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-MHP   Document79    Filed01/13/09   Page10 of 12\n1 Plaintiffsโ moving papers observe that blanket strip search cases such as Bull v. City and County of\n2 San Francisco, 539 F.3d 1193 (9th Cir. 2008), have been found suitable for class action treatment. \n3 In the blanket strip search cases cited by plaintiffs, the complainants challenged a general policy to\n4 strip search in a particular way all individuals meeting certain criteria.  In such a case, a defendantโs\n5 liability for violating the law can be determined on a class-wide basis.  Plaintiffs in the related cases\n6 at bar challenge individual searches conducted under specific attendant circumstances.  The cases\n7 involve individual alleged incidents in different parts of Oakland occurring over the course of\n8 several years and involving many different police officers.  Some plaintiffs had outstanding arrest\n9 warrants; some did not.  Some of the plaintiffs were on parole or probation; some were not.  The\n10 types of strip search allegedly performed on plaintiffs varies widely, from anal body cavity searches\nt 11 to the lifting of the waistband or their undergarments.  Determinations of liability cannot be made\nr\nu\no a 12 without significant inquiry into the attendant facts of each alleged incident.\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 The fact that the alleged strip searches took place at a time when unconstitutional policies\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 were in effect is not enough in itself to establish that any particular search was unconstitutional.  As\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 this court previously noted, the Ninth Circuit has observed that โa search, although not supportable\nS N 16 under an institutional policy, is not per se unconstitutional.โ  Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police Dept.,\nted  For the  17 901 F.2d 702, 715 (9th Cir. 1990), abrogated on other grounds by Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224\ni\nn\nU\n18 (1991); see March 2008 MSJ Order at 20.  There is a factual dispute over whether many or all of the\n19 strip searches took place, and a finding that  a particular search took place has no necessary relation\n20 to whether any other search took place.  Similarly, a finding that a given search was undertaken, for\n21 example, with independent probable cause does not dispose of the question of whether any other\n22 given search was or was not conducted with independent probable cause.  Since the test for\n23 constitutionality involves several fact-intensive inquiries specific to each incident, common\n24 questions plainly do not predominate.  \n25 This is not to say that these cases involve no common questions of law or fact.  Once\n26 individual cases are brought to trial, it may become apparent that there is a basis for Monell claims\n27 against the municipal defendants.  See Monell v. Depโt of Social Services of City of New York, 436\n28 U.S. 658, 690 (1978) (holding that a municipality may be subject to section 1983 liability where\n10\n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-MHP   Document79    Filed01/13/09   Page11 of 12\n1 official policy or custom causes a constitutional tort).  If so, a Monell hearing may be held.  Class\n2 certification would not, however, assist with such a determination.   \n3\n4 CONCLUSION\n5 For the foregoing reasons, plaintiffsโ renewed motion for class certification is DENIED.\n6\n7 IT IS SO ORDERED.\n8\n9\nDated: January 12, 2009                                                               \n10 MARILYN HALL PATEL\nUnited States District Court Judge\nt 11 Northern District of California\nr\nu\no a 12\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14\n  Di\ntates orthern  15\nS N 16\nted  For the  17\ni\nn\nU\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n11\n\nCase3:05-cv-03110-MHP   Document79    Filed01/13/09   Page12 of 12\n1 ENDNOTES\n2 1.
