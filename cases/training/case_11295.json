Paragraphs 1 through 10, above, are incorporated herein by reference as if fully set\nforth in this paragraph.\nJoe Torres\n12. Torres is 48 years old and was born and raised in Belen, New Mexico.  He\ngraduated from Belen High School and has a steady work history.  Prior to September 3, 2006, he\nhad never been arrested in his life.\n13. On September 3, 2006, Torres went to his former girlfriend’s home to pick up his\ndaughter.  While there, he was arrested for allegedly violating a restraining order and was taken\nto VCDC. \n14.  Upon arrival at VCDC, Torres was transferred to the custody and control of\nDefendants and processed for confinement.  After being detained in a holding cell overnight,\nTorres and three other detainees were taken to a hallway adjacent to the cell blocks for male\n4\n\ninmates.  A VCDC corrections officer then called Torres into a laundry area and told him to strip\nnaked.  He complied and was visually examined.  The officer then told Torres to bend over and\ncough while the officer visually examined Torres’ genital and anal area.  Nothing was found\nduring the strip search.   \n15. Defendants had no valid reason for conducting a strip search of Torres.  Nothing\nin Torres’ history, nor the circumstances of his arrest, gave Defendants reasonable suspicion that\na strip search of Torres would result in the discovery of contraband or weapons.  Rather,\nDefendants’ strip search of Torres was undertaken pursuant to a blanket and indiscriminate\npolicy of strip searching each and every detainee processed at VCDC,  in violation of well-settled\nconstitutional law and standards of correctional practice.  \n16. Torres was shocked, repulsed, humiliated, ashamed and distraught at being\nsubjected to this degrading and dehumanizing invasion of his privacy.\nEufrasio Armijo\n17. Armijo is 65 years old and was born and raised in San Acacia, New Mexico.  He\nattended Albuquerque Technical Vocational Institute and currently is retired from a successful\ncareer as a plumber.  Prior to May 28, 2004, he had never been arrested in his life.\n18. On May 28, 2004, Armijo was stopped at a New Mexico State Police roadblock. \nEven though he had not consumed any alcohol, he was required to perform field sobriety tests. \nArmijo was 63 years old at the time and suffered from arthritis and asthma.  His age and medical\ncondition made it difficult for him to perform the tests and he stumbled.  He was placed under\narrest on suspicion of Driving Under the Influence and transported to a police sub-station. \nArmijo then was subjected to repeated breathalyser tests, all of which confirmed that he had a\n5\n\nzero breath alcohol content.  Despite the test results, Armijo was kept in custody and transported\nto VCDC.  \n19.  Upon arrival at VCDC, Armijo was transferred to the custody and control of\nDefendants and processed for confinement.   He was booked and placed in a holding cell.  He\nwas then taken to a separate area adjacent to the holding cell and ordered by a VCDC corrections\nofficer to strip naked.    He complied and was visually examined.  The officer combed through\nArmijo’s hair, and then told him to bend over and cough, while he was visually inspected.  The\nofficer then told Armijo to lift his genitals, also while being visually inspected.  Nothing was\nfound during the strip search. \n20. Defendants had no valid reason for conducting a strip search of Armijo.  Nothing\nin Armijo’s history, nor the circumstances of his arrest, gave Defendants reasonable suspicion\nthat a strip search of Armijo would result in the discovery of contraband or weapons.  Rather,\nDefendants’ strip search of Armijo was undertaken pursuant to a blanket and indiscriminate\npolicy of strip searching each and every detainee processed at VCDC,  in violation of well-settled\nconstitutional law and standards of correctional practice.  \n21. Armijo was shocked, repulsed, humiliated, ashamed and distraught at being\nsubjected to this degrading and dehumanizing invasion of his privacy.\nIV.\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS\n22. Paragraphs 1 through 21, above, are incorporated herein by reference as if fully set\nforth in this paragraph.\n23. The strip searches to which Plaintiffs were subjected were performed pursuant to\n6\n\nthe policies, practices and customs of Defendants of conducting strip searches of all incoming\ndetainees.  The searches complained of herein were performed without regard to the nature of the\nalleged offenses for which Plaintiffs had been arrested, and without Defendants having a\nreasonable belief that the Plaintiffs possessed weapons or contraband, or that there existed facts\nsupporting a reasonable belief that the searches would produce contraband or weapons. \n24. This civil action is brought by Plaintiffs on their own behalf and on behalf of a\nclass of similarly situated persons, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.  The class for which Plaintiffs\nseek certification is defined as follows:  all persons who, in the period from April 3, 2004, to the\npresent and continuing until this matter is adjudicated and the practices complained of herein\ncease, were arrested and subjected to a strip search and/or body cavity search at VCDC pursuant\nto a policy or practice of conducting strip searches on pre-arraignment arrestees without\nindividualized reasonable suspicion that the search would lead to the discovery of contraband or\nweapons.\n25. Plaintiffs are members of the class they seek to represent, and have standing to\nbring this action because they were arrested and subjected to a strip search and/or visual body\nsearch at VCDC without Defendants having a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be\nproductive of contraband or weapons, as set forth in more detail above.\n26. Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23, Plaintiffs, individually and on behalf of the\nmembers of the class, seek such relief as is just and equitable, including but not limited to:\n(i)  Complete disclosure of all information within the possession, custody or control of\nDefendants concerning, relating to or involving the searches complained of herein;\n(ii) A judicial declaration that the searches complained of herein are unlawful;\n7\n\n(iii)  Issuance of a permanent injunction prohibiting Valencia County from engaging in\nthe searches complained of herein; and\n(iv)  Judgment for compensatory and punitive damages to the fullest extent allowable by\nlaw from Defendants in favor of Plaintiffs and the members of the class for personal and\neconomic injury, and deprivation of statutory and/or common law rights resulting from\nDefendants’ practices.\n27. Plaintiffs are unable to state precisely the size of the class.  On information and\nbelief, Plaintiffs allege that there often are more than ten persons per day who are arrested and\ntaken into custody at VCDC and subjected to the searches complained of herein as a result of\nDefendants’ policies, practices, and customs related to said searches.  Thus, the class is\nsufficiently numerous that joinder of all members herein is impracticable.  The exact number of\nclass members will be ascertained through appropriate discovery, from records maintained by\nDefendants and their agents.\n28. Questions of law and fact are common to the claims of Plaintiffs and the members\nof the class, including but not limited to (1) whether Defendants routinely subjected all persons\narrested to strip searches and/or body cavity searches; (2) whether persons are subjected to strip\nsearches and/or body cavity searches without there being any reasonable suspicion, based on\nspecific and articulable facts, to believe any particular detainee has concealed drugs, weapons,\nand or contraband; (3) whether the strip searches are conducted in an area of privacy so that the\nsearches cannot be observed by persons not participating in the searches; (4) whether Defendants\nmay lawfully perform strip searches and/or body cavity searches without reasonable suspicion,\nbased on specific and articulable facts, to believe any particular detainee has concealed drugs,\n8\n\nweapons or contraband; (5) whether strip searches and/or body cavity searches may lawfully be\nconducted in areas where the search can be observed by people not participating in the search;\nand (6) whether or not Defendants’ strip search policy and procedure is in accordance with the\nState and Federal Constitutions.  \n29. Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the\nclass, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with\nrespect to the class as a whole.\n30. There is a well-defined community of interest amongst members of the class.  The\nclaims of the Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the members of the class.  The factual bases of\nDefendants’ misconduct are common to all class members and represent a common policy and\npractice of blanket strip searches of all detainees without reasonable suspicion.  Moreover,\nPlaintiffs’ claims are based on the same legal theories as those of the class members.\n31. The Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. \nPlaintiffs are committed to prosecuting this action, and have retained competent counsel\nexperienced in civil litigation of this nature.  Moreover, the interests of Plaintiffs are coincident\nwith, and not antagonistic to, those of the other members of the class.\n32. The common questions of law and fact herein predominate over questions\naffecting any individual class member, and class action treatment provides a superior method for\nthe fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.\n33. At all times relevant to the acts alleged herein, and as to every cause of action \nasserted, Defendants acted fraudulently, oppressively, maliciously, and in knowing and conscious\ndisregard of Plaintiffs’ rights and the rights of class members, as outlined herein.\n9\n\nV.\nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION\n(Civil Rights Violations Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983)\n34. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference into their first cause of action the allegations of\nparagraphs 1 through 33 above, as fully as if realleged and set forth herein.\n35. The above-described acts and omissions of Defendants were unreasonable,\nshocking to the conscience, and were committed intentionally, maliciously, willfully and/or with\nreckless or deliberate indifference, and in violation of the following clearly established\nconstitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have been aware:\n(a) Plaintiffs’ and class members’ Fourth Amendment rights to be free from\nunreasonable searches and seizures; and\n(b) Plaintiffs’ and class members’ Eighth Amendment rights to be free from cruel and\nunusual punishment and/or Fourteenth Amendment rights to substantive and\nprocedural due process, and to privacy.\n36.  The above-described acts and omissions of Defendants were motivated by evil\nmotive and intent, and involved recklessness and callous indifference to Plaintiffs’ and class\nmembers’ federally protected rights, justifying an award of punitive damages.\n37. Prior to the acts and omissions alleged herein, Defendants failed to properly\ncreate, adopt and inculcate appropriate policies and procedures for corrections officers and\nsupervisory personnel employed by them; failed to properly train, monitor, supervise and\ndiscipline corrections officers and supervisory personnel employed by them, and failed to\notherwise institute adequate procedures and policies that would protect the rights of Plaintiffs\nand class members.  These acts and omissions were direct and proximate causes of the injuries\n10\n\ncomplained of by Plaintiffs herein, as set forth below.\n37. Defendants Valencia County, Cornell, Oliver and/or Barreras maintained a custom\nor policy which permitted or condoned the foregoing violations of Plaintiffs’ and class members’\nconstitutional rights.\n38.        The acts and omissions of the Defendants as set forth above were undertaken\nunder color of state law and operated to deprive Plaintiffs and the members of the class of their\nfederal rights.  Defendants Valencia County, Cornell, Oliver and Barreras are liable for damages\nproximately caused by these acts and omissions.  Plaintiffs are also entitled to injunctive relief\nagainst Valencia County, including a permanent injunction prohibiting Valencia County from\nengaging in the unlawful practices and procedures complained of herein.\n39. As a direct and proximate cause of Defendants’ violations of their constitutional\nrights, Plaintiffs and members of the class suffered damages as set forth below.\nVI.\nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION\n(Claims Arising Under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act)\n40. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference into their second cause of action the allegations\nof paragraphs 1 through 39 above, as fully as if realleged and set forth herein.\n41. The conduct of Defendants, described above, resulted in personal injury and\nbodily injury to Plaintiffs and members of the class resulting from assault, battery, false\nimprisonment, and/or deprivation of rights, privileges or immunity secured by the Constitution\nand laws of the United States and New Mexico.\n42. Oliver and Barreras, as supervisory law enforcement officers, had the duty in any\nactivity actually undertaken by them to exercise for the safety of others that care ordinarily\n11\n\nexercised by a reasonable, prudent and qualified law enforcement supervisor in light of the nature\nof what was being done.  In addition, Oliver and Barreras had a duty to properly screen, hire,\ntrain, monitor, supervise and/or discipline VCDC employees.  Oliver and Barreras knew or\nreasonably should have known of the information described above.  \n43. Oliver and Barreras breached the foregoing duties by failing to properly screen,\nhire, train, monitor, supervise and/or discipline VCDC employees, and by failing to adopt\nappropriate policies, procedures and protocols, by failing to implement appropriate supplemental\ntraining, by failing to appropriately discipline subordinate officers, and by failing to take other\nappropriate and usual supervisory actions to correct the problems and to prevent the harm which\nresulted to Plaintiffs and members of the class as a result of the misconduct of Defendants,\ndescribed above. \n44. Valencia County is the governmental entity which had immediate supervisory\nresponsibility over the actions of employees and agents of Valencia County, including but not\nlimited to Oliver and Barreras.  Therefore, Valencia County is jointly and severally liable for all\ninjuries and damages caused by the negligence of any of its municipal officials or employees\nunder the doctrine of vicarious liability.\n45. The conduct of Defendants was a direct and proximate cause of the injuries and\ndamages to Plaintiffs and members of the class as set forth below.\n46. All of the acts or omissions which constitute the basis for liability herein come\nwithin the scope of the waivers of immunity contained within the New Mexico Tort Claims Act.\n47. To the extent required, Plaintiffs have given written notice of the claims contained\nherein in compliance with the New Mexico Tort Claims Act, §41-4-16(A)-(C) NMSA 1978, as\n12\n\namended.\n48. As a direct and proximate cause of Defendants’ conduct, Plaintiffs and members\nof the class suffered damages as set forth below. \nVII.\nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION\n(Claims Arising Under New Mexico Common Law)\n49. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference into his third cause of action the allegations of\nparagraphs 1 through 48 above, as fully as if realleged and set forth herein.\n50. The acts and omissions of Cornell and Barreras, as set forth above, give rise to\nliability based on assault, battery, invasion of privacy, and intentional infliction of emotional\ndistress.\n51. As a direct and proximate cause of the conduct of Cornell and Barreras, Plaintiffs\nand members of the class suffered damages as set forth below.\nVIII.\nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION\n(Declaratory and Injunctive Relief)\n52. Plaintiffs incorporates by reference into their fourth cause of action the allegations\nof paragraphs 1 through 51 above, as fully as if realleged and set forth herein.\n53. Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and the members of the class, seek a judgment\ndeclaring that Valencia County must cease the activities described herein and enjoining Valencia\nCounty from any further strip searches without individualized reasonable suspicion.\n54. The constitutional violations alleged herein arise from official policies and\npractices sanctioned by Valencia County.  The harm which the Plaintiffs and the members of the\nclass have sustained are directly traceable to these officially sanctioned policies and procedures.  \n13\n\n55. Plaintiffs and members of the class do not have a plain, adequate, speedy, or\ncomplete remedy at law to address the wrongs alleged in this Complaint, and they will suffer\nirreparable injury as a result of Valencia County’s misconduct unless injunctive and declaratory\nrelief is granted.  Plaintiffs and members of the class are in real and immediate danger of\nsustaining future, direct injury as a result of Valencia County’s official policies and practices that\nare ongoing at the time of this suit.\n56. No cognizable burden will be placed on Valencia County by requiring that no\nstrip searches be undertaken without individualized reasonable suspicion.  The public interest\nwould be greatly enhanced by enforcement of policies and practices which adhere to the\nrequirements of the state and federal Constitutions.  Absent injunctive relief, there is no\nguarantee that Valencia County will cease their illegal policies and practices as alleged herein.\n57. By reason of the foregoing, Plaintiffs and members of the class are entitled to\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief as set forth above.\nIX.\nDAMAGES\n58. Paragraphs 1 through 57, above, are incorporated herein by reference as if fully set\nforth in this paragraph.\n59. As a direct and proximate result of the wrongful and unlawful actions of\nDefendants, described above, Plaintiffs and the members of the class were injured and have\nsuffered and continue to suffer damages, including but not limited to emotional distress, anguish,\nsuffering, humiliation, deprivation of constitutional rights, and other incidental, consequential,\nand special damages.\n14\n\n60. Defendants’ acts and omissions, as set forth herein, were malicious, reckless,\nwanton, oppressive, and/or fraudulent, justifying an award of punitive damages against Oliver in\nhis personal capacity, and against Cornell and Barreras, for the purpose of punishment and to\ndeter others from the commission of like offenses.\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs, on their own behalf, and on behalf of the members of the class\nrepresented herein, respectfully pray for and demand judgment against the Defendants as follows:\n(a) For judgment against Defendants for compensatory damages, special damages,\nconsequential damages and incidental damages under any or all of the causes of action, in an\namount to be determined at the trial of this cause;\n(b) For judgment declaring the rights of the parties;\n(c) For injunctive relief; \n(d) For reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred herein;\n(e) For pre-judgment and post-judgment interest in amounts to be determined\naccording to law; \n(f) For an award of punitive and exemplary damages, in an amount to be determined\nat the trial of this cause; and\n(g) For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.\nJURY TRIAL REQUEST\nCOME NOW Plaintiffs Joe Torres and Eufrasio Armijo, by and through their counsel,\nbelow-listed, on his own behalf and on behalf of a class of similarly situated persons, and hereby\ndemand trial by jury pursuant to the terms and conditions of Fed.R.Civ.P. 38 in regard to all\nissues in the above-referenced cause.\n15\n\nRespectfully submitted,\nROTHSTEIN, DONATELLI, HUGHES,\nDAHLSTROM, SCHOENBURG & BIENVENU, LLP\n     By: __electronically signed 4-3-07 JCB_______________\nRobert R.

Plaintiffs allege that they were \neach unlawfully subjected to a strip search perfonned pursuant to the policies, practices and \ncustoms of Defendants of conducting strip searches of all incoming pre-arraignment detainees. \nPlaintiffs allege that these strip searches were perfonned without regard to the nature of the \nalleged offenses for which Plaintiffs had been arrested, and without Defendants having a \nreasonable belief that the Plaintiffs possessed weapons or contraband, or that there existed facts \nsupporting a reasonable belief that the search would produce contraband or weapons. \nPlaintiffs sought damages for civil rights violations under 42 U.S.C. § \\983, and for \nclaims arising under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act.
