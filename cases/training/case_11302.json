    "summary": "<p>On September 8, 2008, Plaintiffs filed a federal class action lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against McLennan County, McLennan County Sheriff's Office, and others in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, Waco Division.</p><p>The named plaintiffs were each arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol. In each case, the arresting officer took the plaintiff to the McLennan County jail where he was subjected to a visual body cavity search. Plaintiffs allege that the strip searches were performed prior to any appearance before a judge and without individualized reasonable suspicion that either plaintiff was concealing weapons or contraband.</p><p>Plaintiffs allege that the McLennan County Sheriff's Deputies routinely follow a policy of strip searching pre-arraignment detainees without having an individualized reasonable suspicion that such a search would be productive of weapons or contraband. </p><p>Plaintiffs seek monetary damages and declaratory and injunctive relief. Specifically, Plaintiffs claim damages for \"distress, anguish, suffering, humiliation, deprivation of constitutional rights, and other incidental, consequential, and special damages\" all arising from the strip search that each defendant endured. Plaintiffs also allege that the defendants acted in a \"malicious, reckless, wanton, oppressive, and/or fraudulent\" way that justifies an award of punitive damages. Plaintiffs additionally ask the Court to enjoin Defendants from strip searching persons arrested for non-violent, non-drug related crimes.</p><p>On May 19, 2009, in a 17-page ruling, the U.S. District Court (Judge Walter S. Smith Jr.) ordered that Plaintiff's claims against \"the McLennan County Sheriff's Department\" and against \"Sheriff Larry Lynch in his Official Capacity\" be dismissed. However, the Court denied Defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to allege a constitutional violation. Taking as true all of Plaintiffs' allegations, the Court held that Plaintiffs alleged a constitutional violation but lacked standing to pursue injunctive relief, because any threat of future harm to the named Plaintiffs is based on a hypothetical situation where they again violate the law. </p><p>After the ruling on Defendants' motions to dismiss, Plaintiffs sought class certification. On October 30, 2009, Judge Smith Jr. denied the motion.</p><p>On January 19, 2010, the parties filed a joint motion to withdraw and pursue non-binding mediation through the Court's Alternative Dispute Resolution (\"ADR\") program.  The parties reached a settlement whose terms are not available at the time of this writing.</p><p>On May 11, 2010, pursuant to the Stipulation of Dismissal filed by the parties, the Court (Judge Smith Jr.) dismissed the case with prejudice.</p><p></p>",

W-08-CV-246\n    §\n    §\nMcLENNAN COUNTY; et al.,     §\nDefendants,     §\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\nBefore  the  Court  are  Defendant  Sheriff  Lynch’s  Motion  to  Dismiss,  and\nDefendant McLennan County’s Motion to Dismiss.  The arguments contained in\neach Motion are similar enough that a single order may adequately address both.\nHaving reviewed the Motions, Response, Replies, and applicable legal authority, the\nCourt is of the opinion that the motions are meritorious in part and should be granted\nin part and denied in part.  \nI. FACTS\nOn or about June 1, 2007, Plaintiff William Robert Bradshaw was arrested for\ndriving under the influence of alcohol.  The arresting officer took Plaintiff to the\nMcLennan County jail where Plaintiff was subjected to a visual body cavity search,\nwhich is better known as a strip search.  This strip search was allegedly performed\n\nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 21    Filed 05/19/09   Page 2 of 17\nprior to any appearance before a judge and without individualized reasonable\nsuspicion that Plaintiff was concealing weapons or contraband.  \nOn or about May 3, 2008, Plaintiff Randall Lee Gerik was arrested for driving\nunder the influence of alcohol.  Like Bradshaw, Gerik was arrested and taken to the\nMcLennan County Jail where he was strip searched.  Gerik alleges that said strip\nsearch was conducted without a reasonable suspicion that he was concealing\ncontraband or weapons.  \nPlaintiffs allege that the Sheriff’s Deputies who conducted the strip search did\nso  pursuant  to  established  policies  of  the  McLennan  County  Sheriff’s  Office.1\nPlaintiffs  further allege that the McLennan County Sheriff’s Deputies routinely follow\nthe  policy  of  strip  searching  pre-arraignment  detainees  without  having  an\nindividualized reasonable suspicion that such a search would be productive of\nweapons or contraband. \nPlaintiffs now seek monetary damages and prospective relief.  Specifically,\nPlaintiffs claim damages for “distress, anguish, suffering, humiliation, deprivation of\nconstitutional rights, and other incidental, consequential, and special damages” all\narising from the strip search that each defendant endured.  Pls.’ Complaint 16.\nPlaintiffs also allege that the defendants acted in a “malicious, reckless, wanton,\n1Because class certification issues have not been addressed, this Order\nexamines only the two named plaintiffs and not the class they seek to represent. \nThe term “Plaintiffs” refers only to William Robert Bradshaw and Randall Lee\nGerik.  \n2\n\nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 21    Filed 05/19/09   Page 3 of 17\noppressive, and/or fraudulent” way that justifies an award of punitive damages.  Pls.’\nComplaint 16.  Plaintiffs additionally ask the Court to enjoin Defendants from strip\nsearching persons arrested for non-violent, non-drug related crimes. \nPlaintiffs have sued McLennan County, the McLennan County Sheriff’s Office,\nMcLennan County Sheriff Larry Lynch, individually and in his official capacity,\nMcLennan  County  Sheriff  Deputies,  sued  under  their  fictitious  names  Does  1\nthrough 50 and Roes 1 through 20.  In the motions before the Court, Defendants\nMcLennan County and Sheriff Larry Lynch in his individual capacity request that the\nCourt dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims against them.  McLennan County argues that two\nnamed defendants–the McLennan County Sheriff’s Department and Sheriff Larry\nLynch in his official capacity–should be dismissed because the Sheriff’s Department\nis not an entity of jural existence and the official capacity action is redundant of the\naction against McLennan County itself.  Both McLennan County and Sheriff Lynch\nargue that Plaintiffs have failed to allege a constitutional violation.  Sheriff Lynch also\nclaims that he is entitled to qualified immunity.  Finally, both McLennan County and\nSheriff Lynch argue that Plaintiffs lack standing to seek prospective relief as the\nfuture harm to Plaintiffs is based on a hypothetical situation.  \nII. DISCUSSION\nIn a Motion to Dismiss, the Court must take as true all well-pleaded, non-\nconclusory allegations in the Plaintiff’s Complaint.  See Kaiser Aluminum & Chem.\nSales, Inc. v. Avondale, 677 F.2d 1045, 1050 (5th Cir. 1982).  The Court may\n3\n\nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 21    Filed 05/19/09   Page 4 of 17\ndismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim only  if it appears beyond doubt from\nthe face of Plaintiff’s pleadings that he can prove no set of facts in support of his\nclaims that would entitle him to relief.  Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 73\n(1984).\na. ACTIONS AGAINST THE McLENNAN COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT\nAND SHERIFF LYNCH IN HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY\nMcLennan  County  first  alleges  that  the  McLennan  County  Sheriff’s\nDepartment, which is a named defendant, is not an entity of jural existence, nor a\n“person” under § 1983.  McLennan County argues that the action against McLennan\nCounty Sheriff’s Office should therefore be dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).\nPlaintiffs acknowledge that the McLennan County Sheriff’s Office is not a separate\nentity amenable to suit and do not object to the Sheriff’s Office being dismissed.\nAccordingly,  McLennan  County’s  Motion  to  Dismiss  should  be  granted  in  this\nrespect, and Plaintiffs claims against the McLennan County Sheriff’s Office should\nbe dismissed.    \nMcLennan County next alleges that the action against Sheriff Larry Lynch in\nhis official capacity is redundant of the action against McLennan County itself and\nhas no independent legal significance.  Plaintiffs state that they do not object to\ndismissing the official capacity action against Sheriff Lynch “provided the Court does\nnot grant McLennan County’s Motion to Dismiss.”  Pl.’s Response 2.  \nSuing a person in his official capacity has the same effect as suing the entity\n4\n\nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 21    Filed 05/19/09   Page 5 of 17\nof which the officer is an agent.  Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 166 (1985).  By\nnaming as defendants McLennan County and Sheriff Lynch in his official capacity\nPlaintiffs name the same entity as defendant twice.  Plaintiffs attempt to make their\nconsent to the dismissal of Sheriff Lynch in his official capacity contingent on the\ndenial of McLennan County’s Motion to Dismiss.  Regardless of whether Plaintiffs\nconsent, the Court will dismiss the claims against Sheriff Lynch in his official capacity\nbecause they are redundant of the claims against McLennan County.  \nb. CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATION\nBoth McLennan County and Sheriff Lynch claim that the facts Plaintiffs allege,\neven if true, do not amount to a constitutional violation.  McLennan County and\nSheriff Lynch argue that current case law permits strip searches of persons arrested\nfor violations of law that are not “minor.”  Defendants interpret relevant case law as\ndefining a minor offense as one for which jail time is not a possible punishment. \nAccordingly, Defendants argue, a strip search of a person arrested for DWI is\nacceptable as there is a minimum punishment of 72 hours confinement for such a\nperson.  Plaintiffs’ complaint should be dismissed, Defendants argue, for failure to\nsufficiently allege a Constitutional violation.  Plaintiffs respond by arguing that case\nlaw from several different Circuits establishes that Defendants’ acts and omissions\nviolated Plaintiffs’ rights under the 4th Amendment of the Constitution.\nThe Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality of strip searches in Bell\nv. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979).  In Wolfish, pretrial detainees challenged the\n5\n\nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 21    Filed 05/19/09   Page 6 of 17\nconstitutionality of strip searches and body cavity searches that were conducted after\ncontact visits with persons from outside the institution.  Id. at 558.  The Second\nCircuit Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court’s finding that the strip searches\nwere acceptable.  Id.  The Court of Appeals also affirmed the lower court’s finding\nthat body cavity searches should be prohibited absent probable cause to believe that\nthe individual was concealing contraband.  Id.  \nThe Supreme Court acknowledged that body cavity searches are extremely\nintrusive. Id.  Even still, the Court stated, “we nonetheless conclude that these\nsearches do not violate [the Fourth] Amendment.  The Fourth Amendment prohibits\nonly unreasonable searches, . . . and under the circumstances, we do not believe\nthat these searches are unreasonable.”  Id.  The Court emphasized the importance\nof according prison administrators “wide-ranging deference in the adoption and\nexecution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve\ninternal order and discipline and to maintain institutional security.”  Id. at 547.  \nSince the Supreme Court’s decision in Wolfish, circuit courts across the\ncountry have distinguished cases from Wolfish and have whittled away at the “wide-\nranging deference” that the Supreme Court relied upon.  See, e.g. Mary Beth G. v.\nCity of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263 (7th Cir. 1983);  Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007 (4th\nCir. 1981); Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796 (2nd Cir. 1986).   Most significant to the\nimmediate discussion is the Fifth Circuit’s decision in Stewart v. Lubbock County,\n767  F.2d  153  (5th  Cir.  1985).    In  Stewart,  the  Fifth  Circuit  addressed  the\n6\n\nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 21    Filed 05/19/09   Page 7 of 17\nconstitutionality of a strip search policy that permitted strip searches of arrestees\nregardless of the crimes for which they were arrested.  Id.  One plaintiff in Stewart\nwas arrested for public intoxication, the other on an outstanding warrant for issuing\na bad check.2  After being arrested and taken to the Lubbock County jail the plaintiffs\nwere strip searched pursuant to the aforementioned policy. The plaintiffs claimed\nthat such searches violated their Fourth Amendment rights.  \nIn its analysis the Fifth Circuit looked to cases from the Seventh and Fourth\nCircuits for guidance.  The first case the Fifth Circuit addressed was Mary Beth G.\nv. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263 (7th Cir. 1983).  In Mary Beth G. the Seventh\nCircuit distinguished Wolfish from the case then before the court and balanced the\nCity of Chicago’s need to search “minor offenders” in order to preserve jail security\nwith the minor offenders’ interest in their personal privacy.  Id. at 156.  The court\nthere held that the city’s interest in security was outweighed by the privacy interests.\nId.  The court found the strip searches unreasonable because the authorities had no\nreasonable suspicion that the detainees were concealing weapons or contraband.\nId.  \nThe Stewart court next cited to Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007 (4th Cir.\n1981).  In that case, the Fourth Circuit applied and distinguished Wolfish to a strip\nsearch of a person arrested for driving while intoxicated.  Id. at 1013.  The Fourth\n2The second plaintiff in the action sued on behalf of herself and all others\nsimilarly situated.  For the purposes of this discussion, however, the Court will\nrefer to the group as one individual.\n7\n\nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 21    Filed 05/19/09   Page 8 of 17\nCircuit pointed out that the offense of driving while intoxicated was “not a minor traffic\noffense.”  Id. Nevertheless, the Fourth Circuit said, it was an offense “not commonly\nassociated by its very nature with the possession of weapons or contraband.”  Id.\nThat court held that the strip search of the arrestee was unconstitutional.  Id. \nUltimately, the Fifth Circuit found Lubbock County’s strip search policy to be\nunconstitutional because it “was applied to minor offenders awaiting bond when no\nreasonable suspicion existed that they as a category of offenders or individually\nmight possess weapons or contraband. . . .”  Id. at 156-157.  Although the holding\nin Stewart relied on the strip search policy’s application to minor offenders–contrary\nto  the  Logan  court’s  reasoning–this  Court  finds  that  Plaintiffs  have  alleged  a\nconstitutional violation.  \nThe case law discussed above addresses two ends of a spectrum of offenses.\nOn one end there are offenses that clearly fall into the “minor” category–offenses\nsuch as failing to register a dog, or public intoxication.  At the other end of this\nspectrum are the offenses that Plaintiffs and Defendants accept to be “major”–drug\noffenses and violent crimes.  Somewhere between those two ends lies the offense\nof driving under the influence of alcohol.  The Court believes that the offense of\ndriving under the influence of alcohol, unaccompanied by any other illegal activity,\nfits more appropriately with the minor offenses.  Of course, a driving under the\ninfluence  of  alcohol  arrest  accompanied  by,  for  instance,  evading  arrest  or\nsuspected intoxication on another drug would fall closer to the “major” offense end\n8\n\nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 21    Filed 05/19/09   Page 9 of 17\nof the spectrum than would DUI alone.  The Court, however, is not presented with\nsuch a situation.  As with other offenses at the minor end of the spectrum, the Court\nfinds that an officer needs reasonable suspicion to strip search someone arrested\nsolely for driving under the influence of alcohol.\nIn the case now before the Court Plaintiffs allege that they were arrested for\ndriving under the influence of alcohol.  As stated, this offense, by itself, falls more\nclosely towards the “minor” end of the spectrum.  The Court finds, therefore, that the\nstrip search of a driving under the influence of alcohol arrestee without a reasonable\nsuspicion that the strip search will yield contraband or weapons is a constitutional\nviolation.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs have stated a claim for a constitutional violation.\nBecause Plaintiffs have done so, neither the action against McLennan County nor\nthe action against Sheriff Lynch in his individual capacity should be dismissed on this\nground.  \nc. QUALIFIED IMMUNITY\nSheriff Lynch argues that he should be immune from suit in the case before\nthe Court.3  Sheriff Lynch claims that his interpretation of relevant case law, which\nwas discussed above, is reasonable and he was not provided with fair notice that his\nactions were prohibited by the Constitution.  Plaintiffs counter by citing to a Northern\nDistrict of Texas case from 1987 in addition to the case law discussed supra to show\n3Because the Court finds that Plaintiffs’ claims against Sheriff Lynch in his\nofficial capacity should be dismissed any further discussion of Sheriff Lynch\nrefers to Sheriff Lynch in his individual capacity.\n9\n\nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 21    Filed 05/19/09   Page 10 of 17\nthat the illegality of the strip search was clearly established at the time of the actions\nin question.  \nTo determine whether an officer is entitled to qualified immunity a court must\ndetermine whether the plaintiff has stated a claim for a violation of a constitutional\nright, whether that right was clearly established at the time of the actions underlying\nthis suit, and whether the defendant’s actions were objectively unreasonable in light\nof the legal rules clearly established at the time of the actions.  See e.g., Thomas v.\nCity of Dallas, 175 F.3d 358 (5th Cir. 1999).  As discussed above, Plaintiffs have\nstated a claim for a constitutional violation.  Accordingly, the Court must next\ndetermine whether the constitutional right allegedly violated by Sheriff Lynch was\n“clearly established” at the time of the alleged violation.\nTo  be  clearly  established,  a  right  must  be  defined  well  enough  that  “a\nreasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.”  Hope\nv.  Pelzer,  536  U.S.  730,  739  (2002).    The  Supreme  Court  has  likened  this\nrequirement to the right to fair notice held by defendants charged with a criminal\noffense.  See id.  The Hope Court clarified that “even though ‘the very action in\nquestion has [not] previously been held unlawful,’” “. . . a general constitutional rule\nalready identified in the decisional law may apply with obvious clarity to the specific\nconduct in question. . . .”  Id. at 741 (citing Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640\n(1987)).    It  is  important  to  note  that  the  Court  must  determine  whether  the\nconstitutional violation is clearly established at the time of the alleged action.  See\n10\n\nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 21    Filed 05/19/09   Page 11 of 17\nHope, 536 U.S. at 741.   \nAs discussed earlier, the Fifth Circuit has addressed the lawfulness of strip\nsearches in the context of “minor” offenses but not in DWI cases.  The Fifth Circuit\nhas not, however, addressed strip searches in the context of “major” offenses that\nare not the type normally associated with concealing weapons or contraband.  The\nFifth Circuit’s brief mention of the Logan case, discussed supra, provides little\nguidance.  In fact, the Fifth Circuit recognized that the Logan court looked past the\nfact that DWI is not a “minor” offense and then immediately reached a decision\nbased on the minor/major offense distinction.  It is not objectively unreasonable for\nan official to interpret the Fifth Circuit’s ruling, which relied on the minor/major\ndistinction, as rejecting the Fourth Circuit’s method that requires looking at whether\nor not the offense is one that is not commonly associated with the concealing of\nweapons or contraband.  \nPlaintiffs allege that the case of Holton v. Mohan, 684 F.Supp. 1407 (N.D. Tex.\n1987), demonstrates that the illegality of strip searches such as the one before the\nCourt was clearly established at the time of Plaintiffs’ arrests.  Aside from its lack of\nprecedential value, the Holton case was decided without the benefit of the following\ntwenty years of case law in which the Fifth Circuit strengthened its reliance on the\nminor/major offense distinction.  See, e.g. Watt v. City of Richardson, 849 F.2d 195\n(5th Cir 1988); Kelly v. Foti, 77 F.3d 819 (5th Cir. 1996).  Plaintiffs further claim that\n“it has been clearly established for some time that a search is ‘unreasonable’ if it\n11\n\nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 21    Filed 05/19/09   Page 12 of 17\nviolates the searched person’s constitutional rights.”  Pl.’s Response 5 (citing Holton,\n684 F.Supp. 1407(N.D. Tex 1987)).  This tautological statement provides no further\nsupport  for  Plaintiffs’  position  in  light  of  the  Supreme  Court’s  statements  in\nAnderson.  Anderson, 483 U.S. at 639 (stating that qualified immunity would be\nturned into unqualified liability if courts allowed plaintiffs to allege violations of\nextremely abstract rights to defeat qualified immunity).  \nRegardless of the state of law at the time of the Holton decision, at the time\nof the actions alleged in the case now before the Court the propriety of strip\nsearches of a person arrested for DWI was not so clearly established as to provide\nfair warning to Sheriff Lynch that his actions amounted to a violation of the Fourth\nAmendment.    Furthermore,  Sheriff  Lynch’s  actions  were  not  objectively\nunreasonable in light of the legal rules clearly established at the time of the alleged\naction.  Accordingly, Sheriff Lynch is entitled to qualified immunity.  \nd. STANDING\nDefendants McLennan County and Sheriff Lynch argue that Plaintiffs lack\nstanding to pursue injunctive or declaratory relief.  Plaintiffs’ request for injunctive\nrelief is based on mere conjecture and hypothetical future injury, Defendants claim.\nDefendants cite to City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95 (1983) for support.\nPlaintiffs argue that their situation differs from that of the plaintiff in the Lyons case\ncited by Defendants.  They claim that a Fifth Circuit case, Hernandez v. Cremer, 913\nF.2d 230 (5th Cir. 1990), supports standing because the complained of activity here\n12\n\nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 21    Filed 05/19/09   Page 13 of 17\nis “capable of repetition, yet evading review.”  Pls.’ Response 9.  \nTo pursue a claim for injunctive relief in federal court, a “plaintiff must show\nthat he ‘has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury’\nas the result of the challenged official conduct and the injury or threat of injury must\nbe both ‘real and immediate,’ not ‘conjectural’ or ‘hypothetical.’” Lyons, 461 U.S. at\n101-102  (quoting  Golden  v.  Zwickler,  394  U.S.  103,  109-110  (1969).    This\nrequirement, which is imposed by Article III of the Constitution, is designed to ensure\ntrue adverseness between the parties.  Id. at 101.  This true adverseness “‘sharpens\nthe presentation of issues’ necessary for the proper resolution of constitutional\nquestions.”  Id. (citing Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 204 (1962)).\nIn City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95 (1983), the Supreme Court\naddressed whether an injured party could seek injunctive relief.  The injury in\nLyons arose from police officers’ use of a choke-hold on the plaintiff.  Id. at 97-98.\nThe Court there held that the plaintiff had not established a real and immediate\nthreat of future injury.  Id. at 108.  In order to be subjected to the injury to be enjoined\nLyons would have to “again be stopped for a traffic violation, or for any other offense,\nby an officer or officers who would illegally choke him into unconsciousness without\nany provocation or resistance on his part.”  Id. at 105.    \nAlthough Plaintiffs cite to Hernandez v. Cremer, 913 F.2d 230 (5th Cir. 1990),\nto support the conclusion that they have standing, the Hernandez case actually\nsupports the opposite result.  See id. at 235.  The plaintiff in Hernandez sought to\n13\n\nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 21    Filed 05/19/09   Page 14 of 17\nenjoin harassment that accompanied his pursuit of a legal activity–crossing the\nborder between the United States and Mexico by a United States Citizen.  Id.  The\nFifth Circuit made clear that  “courts have been unwilling to assume that the party\nseeking relief will repeat the type of misconduct that would once again place him or\nher at risk of that injury.”  Id.  In Hernandez, the Fifth Circuit distinguished Lyons and\nheld that the plaintiff had standing to seek an injunction of the defendants’ actions\nbecause, unlike Lyons, the action he sought to repeat was a legal activity.  Id.   \nIn order to suffer future injury, Plaintiffs Bradshaw and Gerik would have to\ndrink enough alcohol to exceed the legal limit, enter a vehicle and drive while\nintoxicated, be pulled over by an officer, placed under arrest, taken to the McLennan\nCounty jail, and strip searched pursuant to the County’s policy.  The potential for\ninjury in this case is based entirely on a hypothetical future scenario where Plaintiffs\nagain exercise poor judgment and drive while intoxicated.  If drunk driving were a\nlegal  activity,  Plaintiffs  might  have  standing  to  pursue  injunctive  relief.    See\nHernandez, 913 F.2d at 235.  This Court, however, will follow the holdings of the\nUnited States Supreme Court and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and hold that\nPlaintiffs do not have standing to pursue their claims for injunctive and declaratory\nrelief.  See Lyons, 461 U.S. at 1667.\nPlaintiffs next argue that they have standing to enjoin the County from strip\nsearches because the alleged constitutional violation is “capable of repetition, yet\nevading review.”  Pls.’ Response 9.  Aside from the fact that Plaintiffs’ argument\n14\n\nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 21    Filed 05/19/09   Page 15 of 17\ncould not remedy the absence of a future injury, it lacks merit.  Even if the Court\nwere to entertain Plaintiffs’ argument, Plaintiffs’ claim that they were illegally strip\nsearched remains to be litigated in this suit.  In no sense does that claim “evade”\nreview.  See Lyons, 461 U.S. at 109.  “Furthermore, the capable-of-repetition\ndoctrine applies only in exceptional situations, and generally only where the named\nplaintiff can make a reasonable showing that he will again be subjected to the\nalleged illegality.”  Id. (citing DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U.S. 312, 319 (1974)). As\ndiscussed above, Plaintiffs have failed to make such a showing.  The “capable of\nrepetition, yet evading review” argument proffered by Plaintiffs lacks merit and does\nnot convey standing to Plaintiffs.  \nIII. CONCLUSION\nBecause the McLennan County Sheriff’s Department is not an entity subject\nto suit Plaintiffs’ claims against it should be dismissed.  Because Plaintiffs’ claims\nagainst Sheriff Larry Lynch in his official capacity are redundant of the claims against\nMcLennan County, they too should be dismissed.  Taking as true all of Plaintiffs’\nallegations, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have alleged a constitutional violation.\nAccordingly, McLennan County’s Motion to Dismiss should be denied to the extent\nit requests dismissal of Plaintiffs’ claims against McLennan County for failure to state\na claim for a constitutional violation.  \nEven  though  Plaintiffs  have  alleged  facts  that  establish  a  constitutional\nviolation, the right allegedly violated by Sheriff Lynch was not “clearly established”\n15\n\nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 21    Filed 05/19/09   Page 16 of 17\nat the time of the alleged violation and his actions were not objectively unreasonable.\nSheriff Lynch, therefore, is entitled to qualified immunity and Plaintiffs’ claims against\nSheriff Lynch should be dismissed.  \nFinally, Plaintiffs lack standing to pursue injunctive relief.  Any threat of future\nharm to the Plaintiffs is based on a hypothetical situation where Plaintiffs again\nviolate the law.  Furthermore, Plaintiffs’ claims do not “evade review” in any sense\nof the word.  Plaintiffs do not, therefore, meet the requirements of Article III of the\nUnited States Constitution.  Accordingly, it is\nORDERED that McLennan County’s Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED in part\nand DENIED in part.  It is further\nORDERED that Plaintiffs’ claims against “the McLennan County Sheriff’s\nDepartment”  and  against  “Sheriff  Larry  Lynch  in  his  Official  Capacity”  are\nDISMISSED.  It is further\nORDERED that McLennan County’s Motion to Dismiss for failure to allege a\nconstitutional violation is DENIED.  It is further\nORDERED that Sheriff Larry Lynch’s Motion to Dismiss for failure to allege a\nconstitutional violation is DENIED.  It is further\nORDERED that Sheriff Lynch’s claim for qualified immunity is GRANTED and\nPlaintiffs’ claims against Sheriff Lynch are DISMISSED.  It is further\n16\n\nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 21    Filed 05/19/09   Page 17 of 17\nORDERED that Plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive relief are DISMISSED for lack\nof standing.  \nSIGNED on this 19th day of May, 2009.\n_________________________________\nWALTER S.

Plaintiffs move for \ncertification of the following classes: \nClass A, represented by Plaintiff William Bradshaw: \nAll persons, during the applicable statue of limitations (two years before the filing of \nthe Complaint on September 8, 2008), and continuing until Defendants’ custom and \npolicy was brought into compliance with the law, who were arrested and booked at the \nMcLennan County Jail on “minor offenses,” that is, \n \n  •  on any charge (including felonies) not involving weapons, controlled \n    substances, or violence; \n \n  •  not involving a violation of parole or probation for such offenses,  \n \n  •  without a history of such offenses within the last two years,  \n \n \n  1 \n\nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 26    Filed 06/25/09   Page 2 of 11\n \nand who were subjected to a strip search by defendants before arraignment at the \nMcLennan County jail pursuant to Defendants’ uniform and indiscriminate \n(“blanket”) policy and custom of conducting such strip searches, without any \nindividualized reasonable suspicion that the persons searched were concealing \ncontraband. \nClass B, represented by Plaintiff  Randall Gerik: \nAll persons, during the applicable statue of limitations (two years before the filing of \nthe Complaint on September 8, 2008), and continuing until Defendants’ custom and \npolicy is  brought into compliance with the law, who were arrested and booked at the \nMcLennan County Jail on “minor offenses,” that is, \n \n  •  on any charge (including felonies) not involving weapons, controlled \n    substances, or violence; \n \n  •  not involving a violation of parole or probation for such offenses,  \n \n  •  without a history of such offenses within the last two years,  \n \nand who were subjected to a strip search, including a visual body cavity inspection1 by \ndefendants before arraignment at the McLennan County jail pursuant to Defendants’ \nuniform and indiscriminate (“blanket”) policy or custom of conducting such strip \nsearches, without any individualized reasonable suspicion that the persons searched \nwere concealing contraband. \nPlaintiffs also request that Plaintiffs’ counsel be appointed to represent the certified classes, \npursuant to Rule 23(g) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \nII.  MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF  \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \nPlaintiffs submit this Memorandum in accordance with Rule CV-23 and Appendix A of the \nLocal Rules of the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The Motion and this \nMemorandum are provisional, pending discovery of specific information within Defendants’ custody \nand control concerning the following factual issues:  the number of persons in each class who have \nbeen booked at the McLennan County Jail within the applicable period of limitations; the Sheriff’s \npolicies and customs pertaining to the strip search of arrestees before arraignment; and the Sheriff’s \n                                                 \n1  Definition of Visual Body Cavity Search:  Arrestees are instructed to remove all of their clothing, and hand each piece of \nclothing to the deputy who puts them in a bag.  Once completely naked, the arrestee is instructed to bend over and spread \ntheir butt cheeks so that the deputy may inspect their anus with a flashlight.  If the arrestee is male they are instructed to \nlift their penis and testicles so that the deputy may inspect them.  The arrestee is then told to open their mouth so the \ndeputy may look inside and then run their fingers through their hair. \n \n  2 \n\nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 26    Filed 06/25/09   Page 3 of 11\ncomputerized information systems which will allow categorization by date, offense, and pre-\narraignment status (as well as the identification) of the arrestees in each class.  \nDiscovery has been stayed until the present time because the pendency of Defendants’ Motion \nto Dismiss, which was denied in pertinent part by this Court’s Order on May 19, 2009.  This Motion \nis timely under Appendix A of the Local Rules because the Defendants filed their Answer within the \nlast 30 days, on May 29, 2009. \nA.  Brief Statement Of The Case \nThe Complaint in this action was filed under the Federal Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S. C. § 1983, \non September 8, 2008. This lawsuit arises out of the unconstitutional policies and procedures of strip \nsearching arrestees at the McLennan County Jail in Waco, Texas. The facility is a local jail operated \nby Defendant McLennan County; the Defendants before the Court, pursuant to the Court’s ruling on \nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss, are McLennan County and McLennan County Sheriff Lynch in his \nindividual capacity.  (See, this Court’s Order, May 19, 2009.) \nPlaintiffs in the present case are two male arrestees who were arrested for driving under the \ninfluence and booked at the McLennan County Jail: Plaintiff William Bradshaw, the putative class \nrepresentative of Class A, was subjected to a strip search upon being booked; Plaintiff Randall Gerik, \nthe putative class representative of Class B, was subjected to a strip search which included a visual \nbody cavity search.  (Declarations of William Bradshaw and Randall Gerik, filed herewith.) \nPursuant to Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, this Court has ruled that the strip search of \nPlaintiffs, as alleged in the Complaint, was a violation of the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. \nConstitution.  (5/19/09 Order, pp. 8-9.)   \nB.  Statement Defining The Proposed Class, Including Geographical And Temporal Scope: \nAs noted above, Plaintiffs have moved for the certification of two classes of arrestees. The \nperiod for class membership extends from September 8, 2006 (two years before the filing of the \nComplaint) to such time as the unconstitutional custom or policy ceases. \nThe definition of the class excludes all those who were not arrested for a “minor offense” and \nmakes the class ascertainable. (See, Declaration of Mark E. Merin filed herewith.) As many courts \nhave recognized, and as counsel for Plaintiffs have learned in extensively litigating this issue in other \n \n  3 \n\nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 26    Filed 06/25/09   Page 4 of 11\njails, county jails now routinely rely on computers to record the identity of each arrestee, the date and \ncharge(s) involved in the most recent arrest, the charges involved in each prior arrest, the \nprobationary or parolee status of the arrestee, as well as the date of arraignment or first movement to \ncourt. This data can be sorted by offense and by date – a process that results in the exclusion of all \nthose arrested on serious offenses as well as those with a pertinent history of those offenses, and that \npermits pinpointing of the applicable dates.  (Declaration of Mark E. Merin, ¶ 11.) \nThe types of offenses to be considered “minor” can be negotiated by the parties and/or \nsubmitted to the Court for determination.  (Declaration of Mark Merin, ¶ 13.)  If records are kept, an \nexpeditious file review is sufficient to resolve any further questions in the event such information is \nnot noted in the computer. \nC.  Description Of Plaintiffs’ Grievance And Why It Qualifies Plaintiffs As Members Of The \nClass As Defined: \nBoth Plaintiffs were arrested for driving under the influence – in unrelated instances a year \napart in time – and were strip searched at the McLennan County jail. (See, Declarations of Plaintiff \nBradshaw and Gerik filed herewith.) Since driving under the influence is a “minor offense,” as \nverified in this Court’s order, and each was subjected to a strip search, they are members of the class \nof such “minor offense” arrestees who were subjected to unconstitutional strip searches at the jail. \n(Order 5/19/09. p. 8.) \nD.  Appropriateness Of Certification Of The Class Under 23(b)(3): \nUnder Rule 23 (b) (3), an action may be maintained as a class action if, in addition to \nsatisfying the requirements of Rule 23 (a), the court finds that the questions of law common to the \nmembers of the class “predominate” over those affecting individuals members, and that the class \naction is “superior” to other methods for the “fair and efficient” adjudication of the controversy.  \nThe “predominance” requirement “tests whether the proposed classes are sufficiently \ncohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.” Unger v. Amedisys, 401 F.3d 316, 320, (5th Cir. \n2005.)  In strip search cases, the courts have consistently rejected, with few exceptions, the claim that \nthe hypothetical existence of individualized reasons to strip search class members will defeat class \ncertification. Tardiff v. Knox County, 365 F.3d 1, 6, (1st Cir. 2004).  See, also, Smith v. Dearborn \nCounty, 244 F.R.D. 512, 519-520 (S.D. Ind., 2007) [Court determined computer data would “provide \n \n  4 \n\nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 26    Filed 06/25/09   Page 5 of 11\nall the information necessary to determine if a strip search is supported by individualized reasonable \nsuspicion”: while the Sheriff would have the opportunity to adduce additional facts, “[u]nder this \nscenario, it is apparent to the court that the class action vehicle will be adequate to resolve this \nconstitutionality issue for each class member.”]; Jones v. Murphy, 256 F.R.D. 519, 524-525 (D.Md., \n2009) […”because the class was limited to those arrested for misdemeanors or ordinance violations \nunrelated to weapons or illegal drugs, there likely would not be much evidence of reasonableness”]; \nMitchell v. County of Clinton, (N.D. N.Y. 2007) 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48589 *12-13 [class of minor \narrestees certified; “the existence of defenses with respect to individual plaintiffs… will concern only a \nlimited number of plaintiffs” and do not foreclose certification]; Streeter v. Sheriff of Cook County, \n(N.D. Ill., 2009) 576 F.R.D. 609, 614 [predominance requirement satisfied where question is whether \nthe Sheriff’s policy avoided all inquiry into reasonable suspicion, rather than whether individualized \nreasonable suspicion existed]; See also, Florence v. Board of Freeholders, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n22152 *37; Bizzarro v. Ocean County, 2009 U.S. Dist LEXIS 48384 *49-50;  Williams v. County of \nNiagara, 2008 LEXIS 76206 *12-13; Bame v. Dillard, 2008 U.S. Dist LEXIS 40805. \nEven causation and damages are, to a great extent, common to the class. Although \ncompensatory damages may vary in amount, the causation and nature of the injury is the same within \neach class. Indeed, in previous cases, spreadsheets have been used to create “tiers” of damage \nrecovery, setting a specified, standardized amount as the basic compensation and applying \n“enhancements” based on age, gender, disability, and the like. (Declaration of Mark Merin filed \nherewith.) \nIt is well established in the Fifth Circuit that “relatively few motions to certify a class fail \nbecause of disparities in the damages suffered by class members.” Bell Atlantic Corp v. AT & T Corp, \n339 F. 3d 294, 306 (5th Cir 2003.) As the Court observed in Tardiff, supra, at the point consideration \nof damages becomes an issue, “the court would have further options, such as an agreement on modest \nuniform damages for those not claiming special injury, with masters to determine the (potentially few) \nserious claims to special injury. E.g, In re Corrugated Container Anti-Trust Litig., 80 F.R.D. 244 \n(S.D. Tex 1978.).” \nIn strip search cases where blanket policies are challenged, many courts have come to the \nconclusion that potential differences in the amount of damages do not defeat class certification. See, \n \n  5 \n\nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 26    Filed 06/25/09   Page 6 of 11\nthe specific analyses in Jones v. Murphy, supra,  256 F.R.D at 524-525;  Florence v. Board of \nFreeholders, supra, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22152 *37; Bizzarro v. Ocean County, supra,  2009 U.S. \nDist LEXIS 48384 *49-50; Bame v. Dillard, supra, 2008 U.S. Dist LEXIS 40805.  See also,   Johnson \nv. District of Columbia, 248 F.R.D 46 at 57, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9069; Blihovde v. St. Croix \nCounty, 219 F.R.D. 607 at 621, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23964; Mack v. Suffolk County, 191 F.R.D. 16 \nat 25, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4007. \nMoreover, all of these courts have found that class certification is a superior method of \nresolving challenges to blanket strip search policies on behalf a narrowly defined class, such as the \nPlaintiffs’ classes here, because of the relatively modest individual recoveries, which give the \nincentive for individual lawsuits, and because the “common classes of law and fact permit the court to \nconsolidate otherwise identical actions into a single efficient unit.” Bynumv. District of Columbia, \n217 F.R.D. 27 at 49, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4797.  \nE.  Appropriateness Of Certification As A Class Action Under Rule 23(a); \n1.  The Anticipated Number Of Class Members And How This Number Was \nDetermined: \nAs this court is aware, Plaintiffs have not yet had the opportunity to initiate discovery. \nTherefore, Plaintiffs cannot give more than the most general picture of the numbers of arrestees who \nwill qualify for membership in the two classes Plaintiff seeks to certify. However, it appears to be \nwell in excess of forty members, a number cited in the Fifth Circuit, as well as other Circuits, as the \nminimum “ball park” number suitable for class treatment. See, Republic Nat’l Bank v. Denton &  \nAnderson Co., 68 F.R.D. 208,213 (N.D. Tex. 1975). \nThe Texas Commission on Jail Standards website includes a “Jail Population Report,” which \nreflects that 107 persons were confined in the jail under the category “pretrial misdemeanants” in the \nmonth of May 2009. (Declaration of Mark E. Merin, ¶ 3, Exhibit A.)  Since the class includes all the \n“minor offenders,” as defined above, arrested since September 2005, it appears – as a matter of \ncommon sense – that dozens, if not hundreds, of “minor offense” arrestees were strip searched under \nthe Sheriff’s blanket policies. In previous jail strip search cases handled by Plaintiffs’ counsel, the \nclasses have typically included  several  thousand individual “minor offense arrestees” strip searched \nin accordance with blanket policies. (Declaration of Mark Merin, ¶ 4.)  \n \n  6 \n\nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 26    Filed 06/25/09   Page 7 of 11\n2.  The Common Questions Of Law And Fact Involved: \n“[T]he threshold for commonality is not high,” Applewhite v. Reichhold Chemicals, Inc., 67 \nF.3d 571, 573 (5th Cir. 1995), and many of the arguments supporting commonality will also support \nthe typicality requirement.  Forbush v. J.C. Penney Co., Inc., 994 F.2d 1101, 1106 (5th Cir. 1993); \nsee also Shipes v. Trinity Indus., 987 F.2d 311, 316 (5th Cir. 1993).  “The commonality test is met \nwhen there is at least one issue, the resolution of which will affect all or a significant number of the \nputative class members.”  Forbush, 994 F.2d at 1106; Lightbourn v. County of El Paso, 118 F.3d 421, \n426 (5th Cir. 1997).   \nAs alleged in the First Amended Complaint, there are many questions of fact common to the \nclass, including: (1) whether Defendants routinely subject all persons arrested to visual body cavity \nsearches prior to arraignment if they intend such persons to be housed in the McLennan County Jail; \n(2) whether persons are subjected to strip and/or visual body cavity searches prior to arraignment \nwithout there being any reasonable suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts, to believe any \nparticular arrestee has concealed drugs, weapons, and/or contraband in bodily cavities which could be \ndetected by means of a strip and/or visual body cavity search; (3) whether the strip and/or visual body \ncavity searches are conducted in an area of privacy so that the searches cannot be observed by persons \nnot participating in the searches; and, (4) whether the strip and/or visual body cavity searches are \nreasonably related to Defendants’ penological interest to maintain the security of the jail and whether \nor not there are less intrusive methods for protecting any such interest. (First Amended Complaint, ¶ \n23.)  In addition, as noted above, the type of injury and causation is common to the class, in that each \ninjury and constitutional violation resulted from strip searches under the challenged policies. \nThere are also many questions of law common to the class, as alleged in the First Amended \nComplaint, including, but not limited to: (1) whether Defendants may perform strip and/or visual \nbody cavity searches on persons prior to their arraignment without reasonable suspicion, based on \nspecific or articulable facts, to believe any particular prearraignment detainee has concealed drugs, \nweapons and/or contraband which would likely be discovered by a strip and/or visual body cavity \nsearch; (2) whether Defendants may perform strip and/or visual body cavity searches on persons \nwithout first reasonably relating the strip search of the subject to Defendants’ penological interest to \nmaintain the security of the jail and determining if there is a less intrusive method to protect that \n \n  7 \n\nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 26    Filed 06/25/09   Page 8 of 11\ninterest; (3) whether strip and/or visual body cavity searches may be conducted in areas where the \nsearches can be observed by people not participating in the search without violating Plaintiffs’ \nfederal constitutional rights; and, (4) whether or not Defendants’ strip search policy and procedure is \nin accordance with the Federal Constitution. (First Amended Complaint, ¶ 24.) \n3.  The Reasons Why Plaintiffs’ Claims Are Typical Of Those Of Other Class \nMembers: \n“The test for typicality, like commonality, is not demanding.”  Lightbourn, 118 F.3d at 426, \nciting Forbush, 994 F.2d at 1106.  “Typicality focuses on the similarity between the named plaintiffs' \nlegal and remedial theories and the legal and remedial theories of those whom they purport to \nrepresent.”  Lightbourn, 118 F.3d at 424.  The typicality requirement is satisfied, as here, when the \nnamed plaintiffs advance legal and remedial theories similar to those that would be advanced by class \nmembers if they were pursuing parallel actions.  Id.   However, “the two sets of claims need not be \ncompletely co-extensive or identical.”  Ledet, 548 F. Supp. at 782. \n4.  The Reason Why Representation By The Named Plaintiffs Is Adequate To \nProtect The Interests Of The Class: \ni.  Whether The Claims Of The Named Plaintiffs Presently Or Potentially \nConflict With Those Of Any Members Of The Class:    \n “The adequacy of representation requirement tends to merge with the commonality and \ntypicality requirement, since an adequate representative's interest and injury must be aligned with the \nclass, and also factors in competency of counsel and conflicts of class counsel.” Amchem Products, \nInc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 626 n. 20 (1997).  Here, the claims of the named plaintiffs are identical \nto those of the class. They do not presently or potentially conflict with those of the class. \nii.  Whether The Claims Of The Class Require Subclasses Presently Or In \nThe Future: \nSubclasses are not presently required, nor are they likely to be required in the future. \niii.  The Prior Experience Of Counsel For Plaintiffs Indicating Their \nCapability To Handle The Lawsuit: \nPlaintiffs are represented by Mark E. Merin of the Law office of Mark E. Merin along with co-\ncounsel, James C. Harrington of the Texas Civil Rights Project, who individually and collectively \n \n  8 \n\nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 26    Filed 06/25/09   Page 9 of 11\nhave prior experience enabling them effectively to prosecute this action.  (See Declarations of Mark \nE. Merin and James C. Harrington, filed herewith.) \niv.  Whether Counsel Is Presently Representing Or Has At Any Time \nRepresented A Class In Any Other Class Action, And If So, When And \nHow Many Instances: \nPlaintiffs’ counsel are, and have in the past, represented classes in other class action lawsuits. \n (See Declarations of Mark E. Merin and James C. Harrington, filed herewith.) \nv.  The Number Of Cases Plaintiffs’ Counsel Is  Now Handling In Which \nClass Action Allegations Are Made?  \nPlaintiffs’ counsel are handling various cases in which class action allegations are being \nmade.  (See Declarations of Mark E. Merin and James C. Harrington, filed herewith.) \n5.  Other Pending Actions In Any Court Against Defendants Alleging The Same Or \nSimilar Causes Of Action:  \nNone. \n6.  Whether The Attorneys For The Named Plaintiffs Have Discussed And \nThoroughly Explained To The Plaintiffs The Nature Of A Class Action And \nPotential Advantages And Disadvantages To The Named Plaintiffs By Proceeding \nIn A Class Action Rather Than Individually:  \nYes. \n7.  Proposed Notices To Class Members And How And When The Notices Will Be \nGiven, Including A Statement Regarding Security Deposit For The Cost Of \nNotice: \nPursuant to the orders of the Court, Plaintiffs will give notice to class members both by \npublication, by website, and by first class mail. In handling class actions, Counsel has retained an \nexpert class action administrator and anticipates that this may be appropriate or necessary in this case \nas well.  (Declaration of Mark E. Merin, ¶ 16.)  This notice will include information concerning \neligibility for class membership (i.e., the period of the statute of limitations and  a description of the \ntype of arrest (i.e., a “minor offense” not involving drugs, weapons, or violence) which is a threshold \nrequirement for participation in the class), as well as the contact information of  Plaintiffs’ counsel \nand the deadline for filing a claim. If so ordered, Plaintiffs are prepared to submit to the Court a \n \n  9 \n\nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 26    Filed 06/25/09   Page 10 of 11\nsecurity deposit amounting to estimated publication costs, mailing costs, and other expenses. \n8.  The extent of any previous settlement negotiations and the likelihood of \nsettlement with the named plaintiffs on an individual basis: \nSettlement with the named Plaintiffs alone is unlikely, because Plaintiffs’ individual claims \nare identical to those asserted on behalf of the class. No settlement discussions have yet occurred. \n9.  Any other matters necessary and proper to the expedition of a decision on the \nmotion and the speedy resolution of the case on the merits:  \nNone. \nIII.

W-08-CV-246\n    §\n    §\nMcLENNAN COUNTY; et al.,     §\nDefendants.     §\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\nBefore the Court is Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification.  Having reviewed\nthe Motion, Response, Reply, and applicable legal authority, the Court finds that the\nMotion lacks merit and should be denied.\nOn or about June 1, 2007, Plaintiff William Robert Bradshaw was arrested for\ndriving under the influence of alcohol.  The arresting officer took Plaintiff to the\nMcLennan County Detention Center where Plaintiff was subjected to a visual body\ncavity search, which is better known as a strip search.  This strip search was\nallegedly  performed  prior  to  any  appearance  before  a  judge  and  without\nindividualized  reasonable  suspicion  that  Plaintiff  was  concealing  weapons  or\ncontraband.  \nOn or about May 3, 2008, Plaintiff Randall Lee Gerik was arrested for driving\nunder the influence of alcohol.  Like Bradshaw, Gerik was arrested and taken to the\nMcLennan County Detention Center where he was strip searched, and subjected to\na visual body cavity search.  Gerik alleges that said search was conducted without\n\nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 34    Filed 10/30/09   Page 2 of 14\na reasonable suspicion that he was concealing contraband or weapons.  \nPlaintiffs allege that the Sheriff’s Deputies who conducted the strip search did\nso  pursuant  to  established  policies  of  the  McLennan  County  Sheriff’s  Office.\nPlaintiffs  further allege that the McLennan County Sheriff’s Deputies routinely follow\nthe  policy  of  strip  searching  pre-arraignment  detainees  without  having  an\nindividualized reasonable suspicion that such a search would be productive of\nweapons or contraband. \nOn January 27, 2009, McLennan County, McLennan County Sheriff’s Office,\nand Sheriff Larry Lynch all moved to dismiss the case.  Ultimately, the Court granted\nin part and denied in part those motions.  The result of the Court’s Order was that\nSheriff Larry Lynch and the McLennan County Sheriff’s Department were dismissed\nfrom the suit.  The Court also found that a strip search of a person arrested for\ndriving under the influence of alcohol, without reasonable suspicion that the search\nwould produce contraband, was a violation of the constitution.  \nFrom the date of the filing of this suit, Plaintiffs have expressed their desire to\nproceed on behalf of similarly situated persons–as a class action suit.  After the\nCourt  ruled  on  the  defendants’  motions  to  dismiss,  Plaintiffs  sought  class\ncertification.  Plaintiffs claim that this case meets all the requirements of Federal\nRule  of  Civil  Procedure  23,  which  determines  whether  class  certification  is\nappropriate.  Defendant McLennan County (“Defendant”) disagrees and argues that\nseveral of the Rule 23 requirements have not been met.  \n2\n\nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 34    Filed 10/30/09   Page 3 of 14\nA court has substantial discretion in the determination of whether an action\nshould be certified as a class action.  See Steering Comm. v. Exxon Mobil Corp.,\n461 F.3d 598, 601 (5th Cir. 2006).  The Court must, however, “conduct a rigorous\nanalysis of the rule 23 prerequisites before certifying a class.”  Id. (citing Castano v.\nAmerican Tobacco Co., 84 F.3d 734, 740 (5th Cir. 1996)).  In this analysis, the\nburden of proof lies on the party seeking certification.  Steering Comm., 461 F.3d at\n601.  \nThe Court begins its analysis by looking to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure.  That rule enumerates the requirements for certifying a class action\nsuit.  The rule states that members of a class \nmay sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all members\nonly if:\n(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is\nimpracticable;\n(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class;\n(3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are\ntypical of the claims or defenses of the class; and\n(4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect\nthe interests of the class.\nFED. R. CIV. P. 23(a).  These four requirements have been called numerosity,\ncommonality, typicality, and adequacy.  If the requirements of 23(a) are met, a class\naction may be maintained in three situations.  FED. R. CIV. P. 23(b).  Plaintiffs seek\ncertification of the proposed class under the third situation enumerated in Rule\n23(b)(3).  That subsection allows for certification of a class if “the court finds that the\nquestions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions\n3\n\nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 34    Filed 10/30/09   Page 4 of 14\naffecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other\navailable methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.”  FED. R. CIV.\nP. 23(b)(3). \nNumerosity\nThe Court must first determine whether the proposed class is “so numerous\nthat joinder of all members is impracticable.”  23(a)(1).  Plaintiffs must show some\nevidence or a reasonable estimate of the number of purported class members.\nJames v. Dallas, 254 F.3d 551, 570 (5th Cir. 2001).  In James, the Court found that\nthe plaintiffs had met their burden of proving numerosity by alleging that there were\nmore than 100 class members.  Id.  The plaintiffs in James relied on an estimate that\n580 individuals were affected by the defendant’s actions.  Id.  \nIn the case before the Court, Plaintiffs rely on a Jail Population Report for the\nMcLennan County Jail to support their claim that the numerosity requirement is met.\nThat report shows that approximately 107 “pretrial misdemeanants” were confined\nin the McLennan County Jail in May, 2009.  Using this number, counsel for Plaintiffs\nestimates that “dozens, if not hundreds, of ‘minor offense’ arrestees were strip\nsearched under the Sheriff’s blanket policies.”  (Pls.’ Mot., 6)  To arrive at that\nconclusion, however, it appears that Plaintiffs’ counsel assumes that each of these\n“pretrial misdemeanants” fits into one of the two classes enumerated by Plaintiffs\nand  that  those  107  persons  were  arrested  in  the  month  of  May.    With  those\nassumptions, Plaintiffs’ counsel extrapolates the number over a 2 year period and\n4\n\nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 34    Filed 10/30/09   Page 5 of 14\nconcludes that hundreds, if not thousands, of class members exist.\nWhile Plaintiffs’ counsel could be correct in his calculations, the Court does\nnot believe he has met his burden of proving that the numerosity requirement is\nsatisfied.  Plaintiffs’ counsel informs the Court that, because the case is in such an\nearly stage, he would benefit from additional time to discover information that would\nhelp him show that the Rule 23(a) requirements are met.  Although the Court finds\nthat Plaintiffs have not proven the numerosity requirement, it is unnecessary to give\nadditional time to Plaintiffs’ counsel to prove that requirement, as the predominance\nrequirement, discussed below, precludes the Court from certifying the proposed\nclasses.\nCommonality\nNext, Plaintiffs must show that there are questions of law or fact common to\nthe class.  FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a)(2).  The commonality requirement of Rule 23(a)\nrequires there to be factual or legal issues that are common to all or substantially all\nof the class members.  Jenkins v. Raymark Indus., Inc., 782 F.2d 468, 472 (5th Cir.\n1986).   The \"commonality test is met when there is 'at least one issue whose\nresolution will affect all or a significant number of the putative class members.'\"\nForbush v. J.C. Penney Co., 994 F.2d 1101, 1106 (5th Cir. 1993)(citing Stewart v.\nWinter, 669 F.2d 328, 335 (5th Cir. 1982)).  \"The threshold of 'commonality' is not\nhigh.\" Jenkins, 782 F.2d at 472.  As long as class members are allegedly affected\nby a defendant's general policy, and the general policy is the crux or focus of the\n5\n\nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 34    Filed 10/30/09   Page 6 of 14\nlitigation, the commonality prerequisite is satisfied.  Bowling v. Pfizer, Inc., 143\nF.R.D. 141, 158 (S.D. Ohio 1992), appeal dism'd without opinion, 995 F.2d 1066 (6th\nCir. 1993).\nIn the case before the Court, there exist issues whose resolution will affect a\nsignificant  number  of  the  putative  class  members.    For  example,  whether\nDefendant’s strip search policy violates the constitution will affect every member of\nthe proposed class.  Because there is at least one issue whose resolution will affect\na significant number of the proposed class members the commonality requirement\nof Rule 23(a)(2) is met in this instance.  \nTypicality\nThe typicality requirement does not focus as much on the relative strengths\nof the cases of the named and unnamed plaintiffs as it does on the \"similarity of the\nlegal  and  remedial  theories  behind  their  claims.\"    Jenkins,  782  F.2d  at  472.\nTypicality requires the plaintiff to show that his claims arise from the same event,\npractice, or course of conduct that gives rise to the claims of other class members.\nFord v. NYLcare Health Plans, 190 F.R.D. 422, 426 (S.D. Tex.1999).  Moreover, the\nplaintiff must have the same interest and must have suffered the same injuries as\nthose of the proposed class.  Zachery v. Texaco Exploration and Prod., Inc., 185\nF.R.D. 230, 240 (W.D. Tex. 1999).  This requirement focuses on the similarity of the\nlegal and remedial theories of the named plaintiffs and the class members whom\nthey purport to represent. Jenkins, 782 F.2d at 472.  Typicality exists when the class\n6\n\nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 34    Filed 10/30/09   Page 7 of 14\nmembers, were they to proceed in a parallel action, \"would advance legal and\nremedial theories similar, if not identical, to those advanced by the named plaintiffs.\"\nLightbourn v. El Paso, 118 F.3d 421, 426 (5th Cir. 1997).  In fulfilling this element,\nplaintiffs or class representatives must possess \"the same interests and suffer the\nsame injuries as the proposed class.\" Celestine v. Citgo Petroleum Corp., 165\nF.R.D.  463,  467  (W.D.La.  1995).    This  requirement,  like  the  commonality\nrequirement, is not overly demanding.  Id.\nIn the case before the Court the plaintiffs’ legal theories are similar to those\nof the proposed class.  According to Plaintiffs’ complaint, Plaintiffs and the proposed\nclass members were arrested for minor offenses and strip-searched pursuant to\nDefendant’s policy.  If each member of the proposed class were to proceed to trial\nseparately, he would advance a similar legal theory to that advanced by every other\nmember and claim a similar type of damages for the emotional harm he allegedly\nsuffered.  While the extent of the alleged harm would differ greatly among plaintiffs,\nthe type of harm is the same.  The Court believes that the low threshold of Rule\n23(a)(3) is met in this case.  \nAdequacy of Representation\nRule 23(a)(4) requires the class representatives and their counsel to \"fairly\nand adequately protect the interests of the class.\"   FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a)(4).  To meet\nthis  requirement,  the  class  representatives  must  address  two  concerns:    (1)\nconcerns regarding the qualifications of counsel and (2) concerns regarding the\n7\n\nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 34    Filed 10/30/09   Page 8 of 14\nrelationship between the interests of the class representatives and the interests of\nother class members.  Jenkins v. Raymark Indus., Inc., 109 F.R.D. 269, 273 (E.D.\nTex. 1985), aff'd, 782 F.2d 468 (5th Cir. 1986)).   The Court must be sure there is an\nabsence of conflict and be assured of a vigorous prosecution. 1 NEWBERG ON\nCLASS ACTIONS § 3.22, at 3-126.\nPlaintiffs argue that the legal claims of the representative plaintiffs are identical\nto the claims of the proposed class members.1  This situation, however, presents a\nunique dilemma.  The proposed class includes “minor offenders.”  Both parties\nrecognize that there is a grey area where crimes could fall on either the minor or\nmajor side of the equation.  While the determination of membership of the class is\naddressed later, the parties’ discussion in their response and reply demonstrates a\nproblem with the proposed class representation.  \nIn its response, Defendant asks whether certain crimes create a reasonable\nsuspicion  for  a  strip  search.     Defendant  uses arson,  indecency  with  a  child,\nterroristic threats, abuse of prescription drugs, parole violations for violent crimes,\nbringing contraband into an institution, and escape or evading arrest as examples.\nIn response, Plaintiffs concede that such crimes do create reasonable suspicion.  By\nconceding this point, however, Plaintiffs’ attorneys have created a conflict between\nthose proposed class members who are clearly minor offenders, and those proposed\n1As discussed below, the extent of damages differs greatly.  For the\npurposes of the instant analysis, however, the extent of each class member’s\ndamages does not affect the adequacy of the named plaintiffs’ representation.\n8\n\nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 34    Filed 10/30/09   Page 9 of 14\nclass members who are arguably minor or major.  For instance, an arson arrestee\ncould argue that his crime does not create a reasonable suspicion for a strip search.\nBut  that  arrestee’s  proposed  representative  has  already  conceded  this  point,\nprecluding the arrestee’s interests from being represented in this case.  Plaintiffs\nhave an obvious interest in maintaining this lawsuit, and the potential class members\nhave an interest in being a part of the class.  However, Plaintiffs’ interests may be\nbest served by conceding points that effectively preclude litigation of whatever claims\nthose would-be class members have. Because the plaintiffs interests may be in\nconflict  with  those  of  the  proposed  class  members,  a  conflict  between  the\nrepresentative parties and the proposed class members may exist.  \nThe second part of the adequacy query favors class certification.  Plaintiffs’\ncounsel appears to be experienced in litigating the same issues presented in this\nlawsuit in several different jurisdictions.  Counsel’s qualifications appear adequate\nto protect the interests of the named plaintiffs and the proposed class members.  \nAlthough  the  Court  is  not  convinced  that  Plaintiffs  have  met  the  four\nrequirements of 23(a), the Court will now determine whether “the questions of law\nor fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only\nindividual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods\nfor fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.”  FED. R. CIV. P. 23(b)(3).  The\nanalysis of whether certification under Rule 23(b)(3) is appropriate has devolved into\ntwo main inquiries: whether common issues predominate over individual issues and\n9\n\nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 34    Filed 10/30/09   Page 10 of 14\nwhether the class action is a superior adjudicatory scheme for resolution of the legal\nand factual claims raised by the plaintiffs.\nThe Predominance Inquiry\nThe predominance inquiry involves a comparison of the issues common\namong the class members and the issues individual to them.  This inquiry is far more\ndemanding than the \"commonality\" requirement of Rule 23(a).  Jackson v. Motel 6\nMultipurpose,  Inc.,  130  F.3d  999,  1005  (11th  Cir.  1997).    The  Rule  23(b)(3)\npredominance inquiry \"tests whether proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive to\nwarrant adjudication by representation.\"  Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S.\n591, 623 (1997).  The cohesiveness of a class deteriorates when the plaintiffs seek\ncompensatory damages. \nThe  very  nature  of  these  damages,  compensating  plaintiffs  for\nemotional  and  other  intangible  injuries,  necessarily  implicates  the\nsubjective differences of each plaintiff's circumstances; they are an\nindividual,  not  class-wide,  remedy.  The  amount  of  compensatory\ndamages  to  which  any  individual  class  member  might  be  entitled\ncannot be calculated by objective standards. Furthermore, by requiring\nindividualized proof of discrimination and actual injury to each class\nmember, compensatory damages introduce new and substantial legal\nand factual issues.\nAllison, 151 F.3d at 417.  Claims for compensatory damages, then, must be placed\non  the  \"individual\"  side  of  the  equation,  counseling  against  a  finding  of\npredominance.  To do otherwise would allow a class action to \"degenerate in\npractice into multiple lawsuits separately tried.\"  Castano, 84 F.3d at 745 n. 19 (citing\nFED. R. CIV. P. 23 (advisory committee notes)).\n10\n\nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 34    Filed 10/30/09   Page 11 of 14\n  In the case before the Court, Plaintiffs seek damages for “distress, anguish,\nsuffering,  humiliation,  deprivation  of  constitutional  rights,  and  other  incidental,\nconsequential, and special damages.”  (Pls.’ Am. Compl. ¶ 45)  As stated by the\nFifth Circuit in Allison, “in this circuit, compensatory damages for emotional distress\nand other forms of intangible injury will not be presumed from mere violation of\nconstitutional or statutory rights.  Specific individualized proof is necessary . . . .”\nAllison at 416-17.  In this case, the circumstances of each allegedly-unlawful search\nwould have to be presented to the Court or jury.  The potential amount of damages\nfor a plaintiff strip-searched “in an area that could be and was observed by persons\n. . . who were of the opposite sex,” (Pls’ Am. Compl. ¶ 14), might differ from the\ndamages for a person strip-searched in a private room, out of sight of members of\nthe opposite sex.  Even if two class members were subjected to the very same strip-\nsearch, with the very same surrounding circumstances, after having been arrested\nfor  the  very  same  crime,  their  damages  would  likely  differ  as  a  result  of  the\n“subjective differences of each plaintiff's circumstances.”  Allison at 417.  While one\nclass  member  may  be  severely  affected,  another  may  not  have  suffered  any\nembarrassment or emotional harm from the circumstances.  The Court or the jury\nwould have no way of determining damages without presentation of each class\nmember’s personal injuries.  The resultant series of mini-trials is the very harm Rule\n23(b) is designed to prevent with its predominance inquiry.  \nRegardless of Plaintiffs’ desire to characterize the situation as “putative class\n11\n\nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 34    Filed 10/30/09   Page 12 of 14\nmembers all strip searched pursuant to a blanket jail strip search policy,” each strip-\nsearch was a separate event, with differing circumstances for each one.  In this\nrespect, the facts of this case are similar to those in Allison.  Allison, 151 F.3d 402.\nBecause of the predominance of  individualized issues, this case is not proper for\nclass certification.\nSuperiority\nNext the Court must determine whether the class action method of handling\nthis case is superior to other available methods.  There are several factors in this\ncase that tip the scale against class certification.  Primarily, the nature of Plaintiffs’\nclaims and the effect of the Court’s Order on Defendant’s earlier Motion to Dismiss\nmake the class action vehicle inferior.  In the Court’s earlier Order, the Court found\nthat “the strip search of a driving under the influence of alcohol arrestee without a\nreasonable suspicion that the strip search will yield contraband or weapons is a\nconstitutional violation.”  (Court Doc. No. 21, Order on Defendant’s Mot. to Dismiss,\n9)  The Court’s analysis in that Order also made clear that a strip search of “minor\noffenders” was equally in violation of the constitution.  By so ruling, the Court has\naddressed the greatest of the class-wide issues in this case.  The remainder of the\ncase, then, will involve Plaintiffs’ proof of the occurrence of the strip-search and the\ncircumstances surrounding each search, the County’s presentation of any evidence\nit may have of individualized reasonable suspicion, and Plaintiffs’ presentation of\nevidence of individualized damages. The class action suit  is not the superior method\n12\n\nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 34    Filed 10/30/09   Page 13 of 14\nof handling this case.  \nAscertainability\nAs Defendant properly notes, a pre-requisite to any certification is that the\nclass must be ascertainable.  DeBremaecker v. Short, 433 F.2d 733, 734 (5th Cir.\n1970).  In the DeBremaecker case, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held that a\npurported class of “residents of this State active in the ‘peace movement’ does not\nconstitute an adequately defined or clearly ascertainable class.”  Id.  In affirming the\ndistrict court’s denial of class certification, the Fifth Circuit relied, in part, on the\n“patent uncertainty” of the term peace movement.  Id.  \nAs in DeBremaecker, the proposed class definition here involves terms so\nuncertain that it makes ascertaining the class difficult.  Namely, defining the class as\npersons arrested for “minor offenses” would require the Court to determine which\noffenses fall into the category of “minor.”  In many cases, such a delineation would\nbe simple.  As Defendant points out, however, there are a number of crimes that\npresent a more difficult question to the Court.  If the parties were to agree on which\ncrimes were minor versus which were major, the issue would still not be resolved.\nBy negotiating the composition of the proposed classes, counsel for the plaintiffs and\nthe class they represent would be forced to guard the interests of those class\nmembers who clearly fall into the “minor offense” category while negotiating away\nthe claims of other potential class members whose crimes are not clearly minor or\nmajor, as discussed above.  \n13\n\nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 34    Filed 10/30/09   Page 14 of 14\nPlaintiffs also propose that the classes in the case before the Court be\ndefined,  in  part,  as  those  arrestees  who  were  strip-searched  “without  any\nindividualized reasonable suspicion that the persons searched were concealing\ncontraband.”  (Pls.’ Mot. 2)  In order to determine class membership, then, the Court\nwould have to determine whether each proposed class member was strip-searched\nwithout individualized reasonable suspicion.  This would, once again, result in a\nseries of mini-trials that Rule 23 was created to prevent. \nEven if the claims in this cause of action met the four requirements of Rule\n23(a), the difficulty in ascertaining the class and the predominance of individual\nfactual issues make class certification inappropriate.  Accordingly, it is\nORDERED that Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification (Court. Doc. No. 26)\nis DENIED.  \nSIGNED on this 30th day of October, 2009.\n_________________________________\nWALTER S.

Plaintiff, for himself and all those in the class \n\n• \nof similarly situated persons, seeks an order declaring illegal defendants' policy of subjecting \ndetainees in their custody to strip and visual body cavity searches before they are arraigned and \nwithout having any reasonable suspicion that the searches will be productive of contraband. \nDefendants' strip search and visual body cavity search policies, practices, and customs \nviolate those rights of plaintiff, and all those he represents, that are secured by the Fourth and \nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and entitle plaintiff, and all those \nsimilarly situated, to recover damages under the Federal Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. § 1983). \nPlaintiff alleges against Defendants upon knowledge as to himself and all matters of \npublic record, and upon information and belief as to all other matters, as follows: \nI. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n1.

Plaintiff WILLIAM ROBERT BRADSHAW, and all those similarly situated, are, \nand at all material times herein, were residents of the state of Texas who were arrested within the \nperiod beginning two (2) years before the filing of this Complaint, and continuing to this date, \nand who were subjected to strip and/or visual body cavity searches at a MCLENNAN COUNTY \nJail, prior to being arraigned and/or without the defendants first having, and recording in writing, \n2 \n\n•  • \na reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband or weapons. \n4.  Defendant MCLENNAN COUNTY is, and at all material times referred to herein, \nwas a division of the state of Texas, that maintained or permitted an official policy or custom or \npractice causing or permitting the occurrence of the types of wrongs complained of herein, which \nwrongs damaged Plaintiff and all those similarly situated, as herein alleged.  Plaintiffs \nallegations against MCLENNAN COUNTY are based on acts and omissions of the SHERIFF \nand his DEPUTIES and on acts and omissions of those who are COUNTY employees, and on the \nCOUNTY's breach of duty to protect the Plaintiff and all those who he represents, from the \nwrongful conduct of said persons and employees. \n5.  Defendant MCLENNAN COUNTY SHERIFFS OFFICE was a governmental \nentity and local public body as those terms are defined in the Texas Civil Practice & Remedies \nCode, Title 5, Chapter 101(A).  At all times material hereto, MCLENNAN COUNTY was the \nemployer andlor supervisor of the individually named defendants.  MCLENNAN COUNTY had \na statutory obligation to provide for the confinement of prisoners incarcerated under the \nCOUNTY's jurisdiction.  MCLENNAN COUNTY had a statutory obligation to appropriate \nfunds and otherwise provide the necessary funding to maintain and operate a facility for the \nincarceration of prisoners under the jurisdiction of the COUNTY. \n6.  Defendant MCLENNAN COUNTY SHERIFF LARRY LYNCH is, and at all \nmaterial times referred to herein, was a resident of MCLENNAN COUNTY and the duly elected \nSheriff of MCLENNAN COUNTY.  In addition, at all times material hereto, Defendant LYNCH \nwas a law enforcement officer and public employee, and was acting within the scope of his \nduties as well as under color oflaw.  He is sued in his individual and official capacities. \n3 \n\n•  • \n7.  Defendants MCLENNAN COUNTY SHERIFF DEPUTIES sued herein by their \nfictitious names (Does 1 through 50) are all deputies who, as part of their duties at the \nMCLENNAN COUNTY Jail, subjected Plaintiff, and all those he represents, to pre-arraignment \nstrip and/or visual body cavity searches without having, and recording in writing, a reasonable \nsuspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband or weapons. \n8.  At all material times mentioned herein, each of the defendants was acting under \nthe color of law, to wit, under color of statutes, ordinances, regulations, policies, customs and \nusages of MCLENNAN COUNTY and/or the MCLENNAN COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE. \n9.  Defendants whose names are not now known and who are sued by the fictitious \nnames of ROES 1 through 20, are all agents and/or employees of one or another of the other \nnamed defendants who ordered, condoned, authorized, covered up, or were otherwise associated \nwith the implementation of the illegal policy and practices relating to strip searches complained \nof herein. \n10.  Defendants MCLENNAN COUNTY, MCLENNAN COUNTY SHERIFF'S \nOFFICE, and MCLENNAN COUNTY SHERIFF LARRY LYNCH were responsible for the \nscreening, hiring, training, monitoring, supervision, and disciplining of subordinate employees of \nthe MCLENNAN COUNTY Jail, and were the authorities empowering the MCLENNAN \nCOUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES to incarcerate prisoners under the jurisdiction of \nMCLENNAN COUNTY.  Defendants MCLENNAN COUNTY, MCLENNAN COUNTY \nSHERIFF'S OFFICE, and MCLENNAN COUNTY SHERIFF LARRY LYNCH were \nresponsible for administering the Jail facilities and for making, overseeing, and implementing the \npolicies, practices, and customs challenged herein relating to the operation of the MCLENNAN \n4 \n\n•  • \nCOUNTY Jail. \n11.  Plaintiffs allegations against MCLENNAN COUNTY are based on acts and \nomissions of the SHERIFF, his DEPUTIES, and the acts and omissions of MCLENNAN \nCOUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE and their employees, agents, and representatives, as well as on \nacts and omissions of persons who are MCLENNAN COUNTY employees, and on \nMCLENNAN COUNTY's breach of its duty to protect plaintiff, and all those he represents, \nfrom the wrongful conduct of said persons and employees. \n12.  Defendants MCLENNAN COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE and MCLENNAN \nCOUNTY SHERIFF LARRY LYNCH, in his individual and official capacity, also maintained \nor permitted an official policy or custom of causing or permitting the occurrence of the types of \nwrongs complained of herein, which wrongs damaged plaintiff, and all those similarly situated, \nas herein alleged. \n13.  Class action plaintiffs are those similarly situated who, during the period \nbeginning two (2) years before the filing of this Complaint, and continuing to this date, were \nsubjected by defendants to  strip and/or visual body cavity searches without \npre~arraignment \ndefendants having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be \nproductive of contraband or weapons. \nIII. \nFACTS \n14.  On or about June 1, 2007, Plaintiff WILLIAM ROBERT BRADSHAW \n(hereinafter referred to as \"Plaintiff') was pulled over and arrested allegedly for driving under \nthe influence of alcohol in Waco, Texas.  Plaintiff was transported to the MCLENNAN \nCOUNTY Jail and, upon arrival at the MCLENNAN COUNTY Jail, and prior to any appearance \n5 \n\n•  • \nbefore a judge and without there being any reasonable suspicion to believe that he was \nconcealing contraband, plaintiff, pursuant to policies, practices, and procedures of defendants, \nand each of them, was subjected to a visual body cavity search (strip search) in violation of the \nFourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  Plaintiff was coerced, \nforced, and compelled to disrobe for the strip search in an area that could be and was observed \nby persons who were not participating in the search and who were of the opposite sex. \n15.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and therefore alleges, that Defendants routinely \nfollow their policy, practice, and custom of subjecting pre-arraignment detainees, including \nplaintiff, and all those he represents, to strip and visual body cavity searches without first having, \nand recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the search will be productive of contraband \nor weapons. \n16.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Defendants have the \nability to identify all such similarly situated plaintiffs, specifically those who, while in \nDefendants' custody, at the MCLENNAN COUNTY Jail within two (2) years prior to the filing \nof this Complaint, were subjected to strip searches and/or visual body cavity searches prior to \narraignment without Defendants first having, and recording, a reasonable suspicion that the \nsearches would be productive of contraband or weapons. \n17.  Defendants MCLENNAN COUNTY, MCLENNAN COUNTY SHERIFF'S \nOFFICE, and MCLENNAN COUNTY SHERIFF LARRY LYNCH are personally responsible \nfor the promulgation and continuation of the strip search policy, practice, and custom pursuant to \nwhich Plaintiff, and those he represents, were subjected to strip searches. \n6 \n\n•  • \n18.  As a result of being subjected to the strip searches complained of herein, Plaintiff, \nand each of the persons similarly situated, suffered physical, mental, and emotional distress, \ninvasion of privacy, and violation of due process of law and federal constitutional rights, and is \nentitled to recover damages according to proof. \nIV. \nCLASS CLAIMS \n19.  The strip and visual body cavity searches to which Plaintiff, and all those \nsimilarly situated, were subjected were performed pursuant to policies, practices, and customs of \ndefendants MCLENNAN COUNTY, MCLENNAN COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE, \nMCLENNAN COUNTY SHERIFF LARRY LYNCH, and the individual MCLENNAN \nCOUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES sued herein by the fictitious names 1 through 50, and the \nindividuals whose names are not now known and who are sued by the fictitious names of ROES \n1 through 20.  The searches complained of herein were performed without regard to the nature of \nthe alleged offenses for which Plaintiff, and all those similarly situated, had been arrested, \nwithout regard to whether or not Plaintiff, and those he represents, were eligible for being cited \nand released, without regard to whether or not Plaintiff, and those similarly situated, were \neligible for and/or were released on his or her own recognizance, or on bail.  Furthermore, the \nsearches complained of herein were performed without Defendants having a reasonable belief \nthat the Plaintiff, or any of those similarly situated, so searched possessed weapons or \ncontraband, and those facts being articulated and recorded in a supervisor-approved document. \nAnd the searches complained of herein were performed without Defendants taking reasonable \nprecautions to make certain that Plaintiff, and each of those similarly situated, were not observed \nby others not involved in the search. \n7 \n\n•  • \n20.  Plaintiff brings this action on his own behalf and on behalf of all persons similarly \nsituated pursuant to Rule 23, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n21.  The class of plaintiffs is defined to include all persons arrested on charges not \ninvolving violence, drugs or weapons who, in the period from and including two (2) years prior \nto the filing of this Complaint, and continuing until this matter is adjudicated and the practices \ncomplained of herein cease, were arrested and subjected to a pre-arraignment strip and/or visual \nbody cavity searches at the MCLENNAN COUNTY Jail without defendants first having, and \nrecording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband \nor weapons. \n22.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the members of \nthe class are so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical.  Plaintiff does not know the \nexact number of class members.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that \nthere are more than 10 persons per day who are arrested by defendants and/or are in the custody \nof defendants who are and have been subjected to the searches complained of herein as a result \nof Defendants' policy, practice, and custom relating to said searches. \n23.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), Plaintiff is \ninformed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that there are many questions of fact common to \nthe class including, but not limited to: (1) whether Defendants routinely subject all persons \narrested to visual body cavity searches prior to arraignment if they intend such persons to be \nhoused in the MCLENNAN COUNTY Jail; (2) whether persons are subjected to strip and/or \nvisual body cavity searches prior to arraignment without there being any reasonable suspicion, \nbased on specific or articulable facts, to believe any particular arrestee has concealed drugs, \n8 \n\n•  • \nweapons, and/or contraband in bodily cavities which could be detected by means of a strip and/or \nvisual body cavity search; (3) whether the strip and/or visual body cavity searches are conducted \nin an area of privacy so that the searches cannot be observed by persons not participating in the \nsearches; and, (4) whether the strip and/or visual body cavity searches are reasonably related to \nDefendants' penological interest to maintain the security of the jail and whether or not there are \nless intrusive methods for protecting any such interest. \n24.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), Plaintiff is \ninformed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that there are many questions of law common to \nthe class including, but not limited to: (l) whether Defendants may perform strip and/or visual \nbody cavity searches on persons prior to their arraignment without reasonable suspicion, based \non specific or articulable facts, to believe any particular prearraignment detainee has concealed \ndrugs, weapons and/or contraband which would likely be discovered by a strip and/or visual \nbody cavity search; (2) whether Defendants may perform strip and/or visual body cavity searches \non persons without first reasonably relating the strip search of the subject to Defendants' \npenological interest to maintain the security of the jail and determining ifthere is a less intrusive \nmethod to protect that interest; (3) whether strip and/or visual body cavity searches may be \nconducted in areas where the searches can be observed by people not participating in the search \nwithout violating Plaintiffs' federal constitutional rights; and, (4) whether or not Defendants' \nstrip search policy and procedure is in accordance with the Federal Constitution. \n25.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the claims of the \nrepresentative plaintiff is typical of the class.  Plaintiff was arrested on an offense not involving \nviolence, drugs or weapons and was searched, prior to arraignment, without Defendants having a \n9 \n\n•  • \nreasonable suspicion that a strip or visual body cavity search would produce drugs, weapons or \ncontraband (and without the facts supporting any such suspicion being articulated in a \nsupervisor-approved writing).  Representative plaintiff has the same interests and suffered the \nsame type of injuries as all of the class members.  Plaintiffs claims arose because of Defendants' \npolicy, practice, and custom of subjecting arrestees to strip and/or visual body cavity searches \nbefore arraignment without having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the \nsearch would be productive of contraband or weapons.  Each class member suffered actual \ndamages as a result of being subjected to a strip and/or visual body cavity search.  The actual \ndamages suffered by the representative plaintiff is similar in type and amount to the actual \ndamages suffered by each class member. \n26.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the \nrepresentative plaintiff will fairly and adequately protect the class interests.  Plaintiffs interests \nare consistent with and not antagonistic to the interests of the class. \n27.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(g)(l), class counsel \nwill fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class, have experience handling similar \nclass actions (Bull, et al. v. San Francisco, et al., USDC, No. Dist. ofCA, Case No. C 03-1840 \nCRB; Haney, et al. v. Miami-Dade County, et al., USDC, So. Dist. ofFL, Miami Div., Case No. \n04-20S16-CIV-Jordan/Brown; Allison, et al. v. Lincoln County, et al., USDC, NM, Case No. CV \n05-881 WPJIWDS; Gallagher, et al. v. San Mateo County, et al., USDC, No. Dist. ofCA, Case \nNo. C 04-0448 SBA), are knowledgeable about the applicable law, have the resources necessary \nto represent the class, and have no conflicts. \n10 \n\n.---------------•-- ----~---- ---- • \n28.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(A), \nprosecution of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk that \ninconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class would \nestablish incompatible standards of conduct for the parties opposing the complaint. \n29.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(I)(B), \nprosecution of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk of \ninconsistent adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would, as a \npractical matter, substantially impair or impede the interests of the other members of the class to \nprotect their interests. \n30.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(2), Plaintiff is \ninformed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that Defendants have acted on grounds generally \napplicable to the class, thereby making appropriate the final injunctive or declaratory relief with \nrespect to the class as a whole. \n31.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b )(3), this class \naction is superior to other available methods for the fair and equitable adjudication of the \ncontroversy between the parties.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that \nthe interests of members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution of a separate \naction is low, in that most class members would be unable individually to prosecute any action at \nall.  Plaintiff also is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that the amounts at stake for \nindividuals are so small that separate suits would be impracticable.  Plaintiff is informed and \nbelieves, and thereupon alleges, that most members of the class will not be able to find counsel \nto represent them.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that it is desirable to \n11 \n\n•  • \nconcentrate all litigation in one forum because all of the claims arise in the same location; i.e., \nthe MCLENNAN COUNTY Jail.  It will promote judicial efficiency to resolve the common \nquestions of law and fact in one forum, rather than in multiple courts. \n32.  Plaintiff does not know the identities of all of the class members.  Plaintiff is \ninformed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that the identities of the class members may be \nascertained from records maintained by Defendants MCLENNAN COUNTY and MCLENNAN \nCOUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that \nDefendants' records reflect the identities, including addresses and telephone numbers, of the \npersons who have been held in custody in the MCLENNAN COUNTY Jails.  Plaintiff is \ninformed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that records of, and maintained by Defendants \nreflect who was subject to a strip and/or visual body cavity search, when the search occurred, \nwhere the search occurred, whether any reasonable suspicion for the search existed and was \nrecorded in a supervisor-approved writing, whether the search was videotaped, when persons \nsearched were arraigned, and the charges on which such persons were arrested.  Plaintiff is \ninformed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that all of the foregoing information is contained \nin Defendants' computer system and that the information necessary to identify the class \nmembers, by last known addresses, and the dates and reasons for their arrests and/or release from \ncustody, is readily available from said computer system. \n33.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(c)(2)(b), class \nmembers must be furnished with the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including \nindividual notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort.  Plaintiff is \ninformed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that Defendants' computer records contain a last \n12 \n\n•  • \ni  ' \nknown address for class members.  Plaintiff contemplates that individual notice will be given to \nclass members at such last known address by first class mail.  Plaintiff contemplates that the \nnotice will inform class members of the following: \ni.  The pendency of the class action and the issues common to the class; \nii.  The nature of the action; \niii.  Their right to \"opt out\" of the action within a given time, in which event \nthey will not be bound by a decision rendered in the class action; \niv.  Their right, ifthey do not \"opt out,\" to be represented by their own \ncounsel and to enter an appearance in the case; otherwise they will be \nrepresented by the named class plaintiff and the named class plaintiffs \ncounsel; and \nv.  Their right, if they do not \"opt out,\" to share in any recovery in favor of \nthe class, and conversely to be bound by any judgment on the common \nissues adverse to the class. \nV. \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Civil Rights Violations Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n34.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference into this cause of action the allegations in each \nof the preceding paragraphs, as fully as if realleged and set forth herein. \n35.  Defendants' policies, practices, and customs regarding the strip and visual body \ncavity searches complained of herein violated Plaintiffs, and all those similarly situated's, \nclearly established rights under the Fourth Amendment to be free from unreasonable searches \nand seizures, violated Plaintiffs, and all those similarly situated's, clearly established rights to \n13 \n\n• \n, \n( \ndue process and privacy under the Fourteenth Amendment, and directly and proximately \ndamaged plaintiff, and all those similarly situated, as herein alleged, entitling plaintiff, and all \nclass members, to recover damages for said constitutional violations pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § \n1983. \nWHEREFORE, plaintiff prays for relief, for himself and for all persons similarly situated, \nas hereunder appears. \nVI. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Declaratory and Injunctive Relief) \n36.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference into this second cause of action the allegations \nof the preceding paragraphs, as fully as if realleged and set forth herein. \n37.  Plaintiff, on behalf of himself and the members of the class, seeks a judgment \ndeclaring that Defendants must cease the activities described herein and enjoining Defendants \nfrom any further strip searches without individualized reasonable suspicion. \n38.  The constitutional violations alleged herein arise from official policies and \npractices sanctioned by Defendants.  The harm which Plaintiff and the members of the class have \nsustained are directly traceable to these officially sanctioned policies and procedures. \n39.  Plaintiff and members ofthe class do not have a plain, adequate, speedy, or \ncomplete remedy at law to address the wrongs alleged in this Complaint, and they will suffer \nirreparable injury as a result of Defendants' misconduct unless injunctive and declaratory relief \nis granted.  Plaintiff and members of the class are in real and immediate danger of sustaining \nfuture, direct injury as a result of Defendants' official policies and practices that are ongoing at \nthe time of this suit. \n14 \n\n•  • \nI  T \n40.  No cognizable burden will be placed on Defendants by requiring that no strip \nsearches be undertaken without individualized reasonable suspicion.  The public interest would \nbe greatly enhanced by enforcement of policies and practices which adhere to the requirements \nof the federal Constitution.  Absent injunctive relief, there is no guarantee the Defendants will \ncease their illegal policies and practices as alleged herein. \n41.  By reason of the foregoing, Plaintiff and members of the class are entitled to \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief as set forth above. \nWHEREFORE, plaintiff prays for relief, for himself and for all persons similarly situated, \nas hereunder appears. \nIX. \nDAMAGES \n42.  The above paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference as if fully set forth in \nthis paragraph. \n43.  As a direct and proximate result of the wrongful and unlawful actions of \nDefendants, described above, Plaintiff and the members of the class were injured and have \nsuffered and continue to suffer damages, including but not limited to distress, anguish, suffering, \nhumiliation, deprivation of constitutional rights, and other incidental, consequential, and special \ndamages. \n44.  Defendants' acts and omissions, as set forth herein, were malicious, reckless, \nwanton, oppressive, and/or fraudulent, justifying an award of punitive damages against the \nindividually named Defendants in their personal capacities, and against Defendants \nMCLENNAN COUNTY, MCLENNAN COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE, and MCLENNAN \n15 \n\n•  • \nI  ~  !~. . \nCOUNTY SHERIFF LARRY LYNCH, for the purpose of punishment and to deter others from \nthe commission of like offenses. \nx. \nPRAYER \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff, on behalf of himself and on behalf of the members of the class \nrepresented herein, respectfully prays for and demands judgment against the Defendants as \nfollows: \n(a)  For judgment against defendants for compensatory damages, special \ndamages, consequential damages and incidental damages under any or all \nof the causes of action, in an amount to be determined at the trial of this \ncause; \n(b)  For judgment declaring the rights of the parties; \n(c)  For injunctive relief; \n(d)  For reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred herein; \n(e)  For pre-judgment and post-judgment interest in amounts to be determined \naccording to law; \n(f)  For an award of punitive and exemplary damages, in an amount to be \ndetermined at the trial of this cause; and \n(g)  For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper. \n16 \n\n•  • \ni. \"  r. \nJURY TRIAL REQUEST \nCOMES NOW Plaintiff WILLIAM ROBERT BRADSHAW, by and through his counsel, \nbelow listed, on his own behalf and on behalf of a class of similarly situated persons, and hereby \ndemands trial by jury pursuant to the terms and conditions of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 38, in \nregard to all issues in the above-referenced cause. \nDATED:  September 5, 2008 \nMark E.

Plaintiffs, for themselves and all those in the \nclass of similarly situated persons, seek an order declaring illegal Defendants' policy of \nsubjecting detainees in their custody to strip and visual body cavity searches before they are \narraigned and without having any reasonable suspicion that the searches will be productive of \ncontraband. \nDefendants' strip search and visual body cavity search policies, practices, and customs \nviolate those rights of Plaintiffs, and all those they represent, that are secured by the Fourth and \nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and entitle Plaintiffs, and all those \nsimilarly situated, to recover damages under the Federal Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. § 1983). \nPlaintiffs allege against Defendants upon knowledge as to themselves and all matters of \npublic record, and upon information and belief as to all other matters, as follows: \nI. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n1.  This action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988, and the Fourth \nand Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  Jurisdiction is founded upon 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343(a)(3) and (4) and the aforementioned statutory and constitutional \nprovisions. \n2.  Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). \nII. \nPARTIES \n3.  Plaintiffs WILLIAM ROBERT BRADSHAW, RANDALL LEE GERIK, and all \nthose similarly situated, are, and at all material times herein, were residents of the state of Texas \nwho were arrested within the period beginning two (2) years before the filing of this Complaint, \n2 \n\n•  • \nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 9    Filed 11/24/08   Page 3 of 18\nand continuing to this date, and who were subjected to strip and/or visual body cavity searches at \na MCLENNAN COUNTY Jail, prior to being arraigned and/or without the Defendants first \nhaving, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of \ncontraband or weapons. \n4.  Defendant MCLENNAN COUNTY is, and at all material times referred to herein, \nwas a division of the state of Texas, that maintained or permitted an official policy or custom or \npractice causing or permitting the occurrence of the types of wrongs complained of herein, which \nwrongs damaged Plaintiffs and all those similarly situated, as herein alleged.  Plaintiffs' \nallegations against MCLENNAN COUNTY are based on acts and omissions of the SHERIFF \nand his DEPUTIES and on acts and omissions of those who are COUNTY employees, and on \nthe COUNTY's breach of duty to protect Plaintiffs, and all those they represent, from the \nwrongful conduct of said persons and employees. \n5.  Defendant MCLENNAN COUNTY SHERIFFS OFFICE was a governmental \nentity and local public body as those terms are defined in the Texas Civil Practice & Remedies \nCode, Title 5, Chapter 101(A).  At all times material hereto, MCLENNAN COUNTY was the \nemployer and/or supervisor of the individually named Defendants.  MCLENNAN COUNTY had \na statutory obligation to provide for the confinement of prisoners incarcerated under the \nCOUNTY's jurisdiction.  MCLENNAN COUNTY had a statutory obligation to appropriate \nfunds and otherwise provide the necessary funding to maintain and operate a facility for the \nincarceration of prisoners under the jurisdiction of the COUNTY. \n6.  Defendant MCLENNAN COUNTY SHERIFF LARRY LYNCH is, and at all \nmaterial times referred to herein, was a resident of MCLENNAN COUNTY and the duly elected \n3 \n\n• \nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 9    Filed 11/24/08   Page 4 of 18\nSheriff of MCLENNAN COUNTY.  In addition, at all times material hereto, Defendant LYNCH \nwas a law enforcement officer and public employee, and was acting within the scope of his \nduties as well as under color of law.  He is sued in his individual and official capacities. \n7.  Defendants MCLENNAN COUNTY SHERIFF DEPUTIES, sued herein by their \nfictitious names (Does 1 through 50), are all deputies who, as part of their duties at the \nMCLENNAN COUNTY Jail, subjected Plaintiffs, and all those they represent, to pre \narraignment strip and/or visual body cavity searches without having, and recording in writing, a \nreasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband or weapons. \n8.  At all material times mentioned herein, each of the Defendants was acting under \nthe color of law, to wit, under color of statutes, ordinances, regulations, policies, customs and \nusages of MCLENNAN COUNTY and/or the MCLENNAN COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE. \n9.  Defendants whose names are not now known and who are sued by the fictitious \nnames of ROES 1 through 20, are all agents and/or employees of one or another of the other \nnamed Defendants who ordered, condoned, authorized, covered up, or were otherwise associated \nwith the implementation of the illegal policy and practices relating to strip searches complained \nof herein. \n10.  Defendants MCLENNAN COUNTY, MCLENNAN COUNTY SHERIFF'S \nOFFICE, and MCLENNAN COUNTY SHERIFF LARRY LYNCH were responsible for the \nscreening, hiring, training, monitoring, supervision, and disciplining of subordinate employees of \nthe MCLENNAN COUNTY Jail, and were the authorities empowering the MCLENNAN \nCOUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES to incarcerate prisoners under the jurisdiction of \nMCLENNAN COUNTY.  Defendants MCLENNAN COUNTY, MCLENNAN COUNTY \n4 \n\n• \nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 9    Filed 11/24/08   Page 5 of 18\nSHERIFF'S OFFICE, and MCLENNAN COUNTY SHERIFF LARRY LYNCH were \nresponsible for administering the Jail facilities and for making, overseeing, and implementing the \npolicies, practices, and customs challenged herein relating to the operation of the MCLENNAN \nCOUNTY Jail. \n11.  Plaintiffs' allegations against MCLENNAN COUNTY are based on acts and \nomissions of the SHERIFF, his DEPUTIES, and the acts and omissions of MCLENNAN \nCOUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE and their employees, agents, and representatives, as well as on \nacts and omissions of persons who are MCLENNAN COUNTY employees, and on \nMCLENNAN COUNTY's breach of its duty to protect Plaintiffs, and all those they represent, \nfrom the wrongful conduct of said persons and employees. \n12.  Defendants MCLENNAN COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE and MCLENNAN \nCOUNTY SHERIFF LARRY LYNCH, in his individual and official capacity, also maintained \nor permitted an official policy or custom of causing or permitting the occurrence of the types of \nwrongs complained of herein, which wrongs damaged Plaintiffs, and all those similarly situated, \nas herein alleged. \n13.  Class action Plaintiffs are those similarly situated who, during the period \nbeginning two (2) years before the filing of this Complaint, and continuing to this date, were \nsubjected by Defendants to pre-arraignment strip and/or visual body cavity searches without \nDefendants having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be \nproductive of contraband or weapons. \n5 \n\n• \nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 9    Filed 11/24/08   Page 6 of 18\nIII. \nFACTS \n14.  On or about June 1,2007, Plaintiff WILLIAM ROBERT BRADSHAW \n(hereinafter referred to as \"BRADSHAW\") was pulled over and arrested allegedly for driving \nunder the influence of alcohol in Waco, Texas.  BRADSHAW was transported to the \nMCLENNAN COUNTY Jail and, upon arrival at the MCLENNAN COUNTY Jail, and prior to \nany appearance before a judge and without there being any reasonable suspicion to believe that \nhe was concealing contraband, BRADSHAW, pursuant to policies, practices, and procedures of \nDefendants, and each of them, was subjected to a visual body cavity search (strip search) in \nviolation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. \nBRADSHA W was coerced, forced, and compelled to disrobe for the strip search in an area that \ncould be and was observed by persons who were not participating in the search and who were of \nthe opposite sex. \n15.  On or about May 3, 2008, Plaintiff RANDALL LEE GERIK (hereinafter referred \nto as \"GERIK\") was pulled over and arrested allegedly for driving under the influence of alcohol \nin Waco, Texas.  GERIK was transported to the MCLENNAN COUNTY JAIL and, upon arrival \nat the MCLENNAN COUNTY Jail, and prior to any appearance before a judge and without \nthere being any reasonable suspicion to believe that he was concealing contraband, GERIK, \npursuant to policies, practices, and procedures of Defendants, and each of them, was subjected to \na visual body cavity search (strip search) in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments \nto the United States Constitution.  GERIK was coerced, forced, and compelled to disrobe for the \nstrip search in an area that could be and was observed by persons who were not participating in \nthe search and who were of the opposite sex. \n6 \n\n• \nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 9    Filed 11/24/08   Page 7 of 18\n16.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and therefore allege, that Defendants \nroutinely follow their policy, practice, and custom of subjecting pre-arraignment detainees, \nincluding Plaintiffs, and all those they represent, to strip and visual body cavity searches without \nfirst having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the search will be productive of \ncontraband or weapons. \n17.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that Defendants have the \nability to identify all such similarly situated Plaintiffs, specifically those who, while in \nDefendants' custody, at the MCLENNAN COUNTY Jail within two (2) years prior to the filing \nofthis Complaint, were subjected to strip searches andlor visual body cavity searches prior to \narraignment without Defendants first having, and recording, a reasonable suspicion that the \nsearches would be productive of contraband or weapons. \n18.  Defendants MCLENNAN COUNTY, MCLENNAN COUNTY SHERIFF'S \nOFFICE, and MCLENNAN COUNTY SHERIFF LARRY LYNCH are personally responsible \nfor the promulgation and continuation of the strip search policy, practice, and custom pursuant to \nwhich Plaintiffs, and those they represent, were subjected to strip searches. \n19.  As a result of being subjected to the strip searches complained of herein, \nPlaintiffs, and each of the persons similarly situated, suffered physical, mental, and emotional \ndistress, invasion of privacy, and violation of due process of law and federal constitutional \nrights, and are entitled to recover damages according to proof. \nIV. \nCLASS CLAIMS \n20.  The strip and visual body cavity searches to which Plaintiffs, and all those \nsimilarly situated, were subjected were performed pursuant to policies, practices, and customs of \n7 \n\n- -- - ---\n~~~-~\"\"\"i?,f.'~~~---------~-- •~---- ---~---~---- ~-\nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 9    Filed 11/24/08   Page 8 of 18\nDefendants MCLENNAN COUNTY, MCLENNAN COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE, \nMCLENNAN COUNTY SHERIFF LARRY LYNCH, and the individual MCLENNAN \nCOUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES sued herein by the fictitious names 1 through 50, and the \nindividuals whose names are not now known and who are sued by the fictitious names of ROES \n1 through 20.  The searches complained of herein were performed without regard to the nature of \nthe alleged offenses for which Plaintiffs, and all those similarly situated, had been arrested, \nwithout regard to whether or not Plaintiffs, and those they represent, were eligible for being cited \nand released, without regard to whether or not Plaintiffs, and those similarly situated, were \neligible for and/or were released on his or her own recognizance, or on bail.  Furthermore, the \nsearches complained of herein were performed without Defendants having a reasonable belief \nthat Plaintiffs, or any of those similarly situated, so searched possessed weapons or contraband, \nand those facts being articulated and recorded in a supervisor-approved document.  And the \nsearches complained of herein were performed without Defendants taking reasonable \nprecautions to make certain that Plaintiffs, and each of those similarly situated, were not \nobserved by others not involved in the search. \n21.  Plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalf and on behalf of all persons \nsimilarly situated pursuant to Rule 23, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n22.  The class of Plaintiffs is defined to include all persons arrested on charges not \ninvolving violence, drugs or weapons who, jn the period from and including two (2) years prior \nto the filing of this Complaint, and continuing until this matter is adjudicated and the practices \ncomplained of herein cease, were arrested and subjected to a pre-arraignment strip and/or visual \nbody cavity searches at the MCLENNAN COUNTY Jail without Defendants first having, and \n8 \n\n• \nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 9    Filed 11/24/08   Page 9 of 18\nrecording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband \nor weapons. \n23.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the members of \nthe class are so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical.  Plaintiffs do not know the \nexact number of class members.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that \nthere are more than 10 persons per day who are arrested by Defendants and/or are in the custody \nof Defendants who are and have been subjected to the searches complained of herein as a result \nof Defendants' policy, practice, and custom relating to said searches. \n24.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), Plaintiffs are \ninformed and believe, and thereupon allege, that there are many questions of fact common to the \nclass including, but not limited to: (1) whether Defendants routinely subject all persons arrested \nto visual body cavity searches prior to arraignment if they intend such persons to be housed in \nthe. MCLENNAN COUNTY Jail; (2) whether persons are subjected to strip and/or visual body \ncavity searches prior to arraignment without there being any reasonable suspicion, based on \nspecific or articulable facts, to believe any particular arrestee has concealed drugs, weapons, \nand/or contraband in bodily cavities which could be detected by means of a strip and/or visual \nbody cavity search; (3) whether the strip and/or visual body cavity searches are conducted in an \narea of privacy so that the searches cannot be observed by persons not participating in the \nsearches; and, (4) whether the strip and/or visual body cavity searches are reasonably related to \nDefendants' penological interest to maintain the security ofthe jail and whether or not there are \nless intrusive methods for protecting any such interest. \n9 \n\n•  •  ---------------~-~~~~ \nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 9    Filed 11/24/08   Page 10 of 18\n25.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), Plaintiffs are \ninfonned and believe, and thereupon allege, that there are many questions of law common to the \nclass including, but not limited to: (1) whether Defendants may perfonn strip andlor visual body \ncavity searches on persons prior to their arraignment without reasonable suspicion, based on \nspecific or articulable facts, to believe any particular prearraignment detainee has concealed \ndrugs, weapons and/or contraband which would likely be discovered by a strip andlor visual \nbody cavity search; (2) whether Defendants may perfonn strip andlor visual body cavity \nsearches on persons without first reasonably relating the strip search of the subject to \nDefendants' penological interest to maintain the security of the jail and detennining if there is a \nless intrusive method to protect that interest; (3) whether strip andlor visual body cavity searches \nmay be conducted in areas where the searches can be observed by people not participating in the \nsearch without violating Plaintiffs' federal constitutional rights; and, (4) whether or not \nDefendants' strip search policy and procedure is in accordance with the Federal Constitution. \n26.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the claims of the \nrepresentative Plaintiffs are typical of the class.  Plaintiffs were arrested on offenses not \ninvolving violence, drugs or weapons and were searched, prior to arraignment, without \nDefendants having a reasonable suspicion that a strip or visual body cavity search would produce \ndrugs, weapons or contraband (and without the facts supporting any such suspicion being \narticulated in a supervisor-approved writing).  Representative Plaintiffs have the same interests \nand suffered the same type of injuries as all of the class members.  Plaintiffs' claims arose \nbecause of Defendants' policy, practice, and custom of subjecting arrestees to strip andlor visual \nbody cavity searches before arraignment without having, and recording in writing, a reasonable \n10 \n\n• \nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 9    Filed 11/24/08   Page 11 of 18\nsuspicion that the search would be productive of contraband or weapons.  Each class member \nsuffered actual damages as a result of being subjected to a strip and/or visual body cavity search. \nThe actual damages suffered by the representative Plaintiffs are similar in type and amount to \nthe actual damages suffered by each class member. \n27.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the \nrepresentative Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the class interests.  Plaintiffs' interests \nare consistent with and not antagonistic to the interests of the class. \n28.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23 (g)(1 ), class counsel \nwill fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class, have experience handling similar \nclass actions (Bull, et al. v. San Francisco, et al., USDC, No. Dist. ofCA, Case No. C 03-1840 \nCRB; Haney,et al. v. Miami-Dade County, et al., USDC, So. Dist. ofFL, Miami Div., Case No. \n04-20516-CIV-Jordan/Brown; Allison, et al. v. Lincoln County, et al., USDC, NM, Case No. CV \n05-881 WPJIWDS; Gallagher, et al. v. San Mateo County, et al., USDC, No. Dist. ofCA, Case \nNo. C 04-0448 SBA), are knowledgeable about the applicable law, have the resources necessary \nto represent the class, and have no conflicts. \n29.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(A), \nprosecution of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk that \ninconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class would \nestablish incompatible standards of conduct for the parties opposing the complaint. \n30.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(B), \nprosecution of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk of \ninconsistent adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would, as a \n11 \n\n• \nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 9    Filed 11/24/08   Page 12 of 18\npractical matter, substantially impair or impede the interests of the other members of the class to \nprotect their interests. \n31.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b )(2), Plaintiffs are \ninformed and believe, and thereupon allege, that Defendants have acted on grounds generally \napplicable to the class, thereby making appropriate the final injunctive or declaratory relief with \nrespect to the class as a whole. \n32.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), this class \naction is superior to other available methods for the fair and equitable adjudication of the \ncontroversy between the parties.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that \nthe interests of members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution of a separate \naction is low, in that most class members would be unable individually to prosecute any action at \nall.  Plaintiffs also are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the amounts at stake for \nindividuals are so small that separate suits would be impracticable.  Plaintiffs are informed and \nbelieve, and thereupon allege, that most members of the class will not be able to find counsel to \nrepresent them.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that it is desirable to \nconcentrate all litigation in one forum because all of the claims arise in the same location; i.e., \nthe MCLENNAN COUNTY Jail.  It will promote judicial efficiency to resolve the common \nquestions of law and fact in one forum, rather than in multiple courts. \n33.  Plaintiffs do not know the identities of all of the class members.  Plaintiffs are \ninformed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the identities of the class members may be \nascertained from records maintained by Defendants MCLENNAN COUNTY and MCLENNAN \nCOUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that \n12 \n\n• \nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 9    Filed 11/24/08   Page 13 of 18\nDefendants' records reflect the identities, including addresses and telephone numbers, of the \npe,rsons who have been held in custody in the MCLENNAN COUNTY Jails.  Plaintiffs are \ninformed and believe, and thereupon allege, that records of, and maintained by Defendants \nreflect who was subject to a strip and/or visual body cavity search, when the search occurred, \nwhere the search occurred, whether any reasonable suspicion for the search existed and was \nrecorded in a supervisor-approved writing, whether the search was videotaped, when persons \nsearched were arraigned, and the charges on which such persons were arrested.  Plaintiffs are \ninformed and believe, and thereupon allege, that all of the foregoing information is contained in \nDefendants' computer system and that the information necessary to identify the class members, \nby last known addresses, and the dates and reasons for their arrests and/or release from custody, \nis readily available from said computer system. \n34.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23( c) (2)(b), class \nmembers must be furnished with the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including \nindividual notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort.  Plaintiffs are \ninformed and believe, and thereupon allege, that Defendants' computer records contain a last \nknown address for class members.  Plaintiffs contemplate that individual notice will be given to \nclass members at such last known address by first class mail.

The constitutional violations alleged herein arise from official policies and \npractices sanctioned by Defendants.  The harm which Plaintiffs and the members of the class \nhave sustained are directly traceable to these officially sanctioned policies and procedures. \n40.  Plaintiffs and members of the class do not have a plain, adequate, speedy, or \ncomplete remedy at law to address the wrongs alleged in this Complaint, and they will suffer \nirreparable injury as a result of Defendants' misconduct unless injunctive and declaratory relief \nis granted.  Plaintiffs and members of the class are in real and immediate danger of sustaining \nfuture, direct injury as a result of Defendants' official policies and practices that are ongoing at \nthe time of this suit. \n41.  No cognizable burden will be placed on Defendants by requiring that no strip \nsearches be undertaken without individualized reasonable suspicion.  The public interest would \nbe greatly enhanced by enforcement of policies and practices which adhere to the requirements \nof the federal Constitution.  Absent injunctive relief, there is no guarantee the Defendants will \ncease their illegal policies and practices as alleged herein. \n15 \n\n•  • \nCase 6:08-cv-00246-WSS-JCM   Document 9    Filed 11/24/08   Page 16 of 18\nf  ' \n42.
