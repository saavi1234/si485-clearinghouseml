    "summary": "<p>On March 27, 2007, Plaintiffs, individually and as class representatives, filed a civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California, Fresno Division, against Kern County California, the Kern County Sheriff's Department (\"KCSD\"), and officials in their supervising capacity. Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief and damages resulting from the strip and/or visual body cavity searches of prisoners by Defendants.</p><p>The complaint, later amended, pursues causes of action for violations of the Fourth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, violation of Article I, ยงยง 1, 7, 13 and 17 of the California Constitution and state law violations. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants maintained a policy of indiscriminately strip/body cavity searching all or a large number of persons being processed into the jail without limitation on the number of persons who can see, hear or observe the searches. Plaintiffs also allege that Defendants improperly strip searched detainees who had been ordered released.</p><p>On July 17, 2008, Defendants filed a joint motion for summary adjudication regarding liability of entities and individuals as to group strip searches. Defendants contend that the group strip searches at issue do not violate the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. In addition, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' equal protection claim and state law claims fail as a matter of law.</p><p>On June 17, 2008, Plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification, seeking certification of two classes--the Post-Release Class and the Group Strip Search Class.</p><p> </p><p>On November 7, 2008, Defendants filed a second joint motion for summary adjudication regarding court returnees, qualified immunity and Eleventh Amendment immunity. Defendants contend that (1) the searches of certain Plaintiffs who assert that their constitutional rights were violated when they were subjected to strip searches after returning to the jail following a court appearance in which they were ordered released were reasonable; (2) Defendants are immune from liability because the law was not clearly established that searching post-arraignment detainees in small groups violates Plaintiffs' rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and violates the Equal Protection Clause; (3) the Sheriff is a state actor and immune from a ยง 1983 suit; and (4) the County should be dismissed from the action.</p><p>On November 7, 2008, Plaintiffs filed a cross-motion for partial summary judgment and/or summary adjudication. Plaintiffs sought a determination that (1) KCSD's policy of strip searching persons ordered released from custody violated the Fourth Amendment; (2) KCSD's policy of group strip searching prisoners violated the Fourth Amendment; (3) the strip search policies violated Plaintiffs' state constitutional rights pursuant to Cal. Const. Art. I, ยง 1 (privacy), Cal. Const. Art. I, ยง 13 (unreasonable searches) and Cal. Const. Art. I, ยง 7 (equal protection); and (4) the entity defendants are liable under federal and state law.</p><p>On March 31, 2009, in a published order, the Court (Magistrate Judge Dennis L. Beck) granted in part and denied in part the parties' motions for partial summary judgment/summary adjudication and on April 01, 2009, certified the two putative Plaintiff classes.</p><p>Plaintiffs and Defendants sought interlocutory appeals to the Ninth Circuit. However, pursuant to the stipulation of the parties and the supplemental letter filed by counsel on January 21, 2011, these consolidated appeals were voluntarily dismissed without prejudice. On January 21, 2011, the parties filed a joint motion for preliminary approval of a class settlement in the District Court. </p><p>On February 23, 2011, the District Court preliminarily approved the Settlement Agreement. In a nutshell, the Settlement Agreement provides that: (1) each Post-Release Class Member who files a claim shall receive $1500; (2) each Group Strip Search Class Member shall receive $200; (3) Post-Release Class Members may receive an additional $750 if s/he was subjected to a second such search during the class period; (4) the class payment figures are subject to certain aggregate maximums to be paid each class (totaling approximately $4,350,000 for the two classes combined), after which payments would be prorated; (5) Defendants shall separately pay $30,000 to each of the three named plaintiffs, pay the cost of class administration, pay class counsel costs not to exceed $65,000, and pay class counsel attorneys' fees of $2 million.</p><p>On August 31, 2011, the District Court issued a final order to approve the Settlement. On September 02, 2011, the District Court awarded the class counsels attorneys' fees in the amount of $2 million, and costs in the amount of $44,393.60.</p><p>(Updated on April 21, 2012)</p><p></p>",

INTRODUCTION \n3 Defendant Kern County operates its own jails under the auspices of the Kern \n4 County Sheriffโs Department (โKCSDโ). Cal. Govt. Code ยง26605; Cal. Penal \nCode ยง4000.1  See, also, Defendantsโ Answer to Plaintiffsโ Second Amended \n5\nComplaint, ยถ5 (admitting that the KCSD is an agency of the County). \n6\nUntil October 2007, the policy of the KCSD was 1) to strip/visual body \n7\ncavity search (hereafter โstrip/vbc searchโ) all persons who appeared in court and \n8\nbecame entitled to release. The individual would be taken back to the housing \n9\nlocation in which s/he had been placed and strip searched, or alternatively would \n10\nbe returned to the Central Receiving Facility (โCRFโ) and strip searched there.  \n11\nThis shall be referred to herein as the โPost-Release Classโ. \n12\nIn addition, until that date, strip/vbc searches were routinely conducted any \n13\ntime an inmate was moved out of the facility and returned, including when taken to \n14\ncourt and returned. All such strip/vbc searches during that time period occurred in \n15\ngroups where inmates could view each other during the search. Thus, the searches \n16\nwere not conducted in such a manner as to provide privacy to those being searched.  \n17\nThis is referred to herein as the โGroup Strip Search Classโ.2\n18\nThis motion seeks certification of these two classes. \n19\n20\n                                           \n21\n1 Kern County Sheriffs website at http://www.co.kern.ca.us/sheriff/index.html \n22\nstates that, โThe Sheriff is the chief law enforcement officer in the county. In \n23\naddition to providing police services to the unincorporated portions of the county, \nthe Sheriff has the responsibility for the jail systemโฆ.โ Ex. โ4โ. \n24\n2 Plaintiffsโ First Amended Complaint also alleges that the KCSD conducts routine \n25\nstrip/vbc searches prior to as part of the booking process prior to arraignment. \n(โPrearraignment Classโ)  However, based on the discovery adduced thus far, there \n26\ndoes not appear to be any factual basis to make such a claim.  Therefore, plaintiffs \n27\nshall not seek to certify a Prearraignment Class, pending further discovery. \n  1 \n28\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 33-1    Filed 06/17/08   Page 13 of 37\n   \n1 II.  COUNTY STRIP SEARCH POLICIES AND PRACTICES \n2 The alleged County policies are, for the most part, admitted by the County.  \n3 In any event, in deciding a motion for class certification, it is axiomatic that the \n4 plaintiffs' allegations in the complaint are taken as true. Eisen v. Carlisle & \nJacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 177-78 (1974). \n5\nPlaintiffs deposed Sgt. Ian Silva on December 7, 2007, as the designated \n6\nrepresentative of the Kern County Sheriffโs Department on various strip search \n7\npolicy issues. Most of the description below of the Kern County practices in effect \n8\nduring the class period are based on his testimony.  \n9\nA.  KCSD Strip Search Methodology \n10\n \n11 A strip search in the Kern County Jail typically entails the following: The \n12 inmate removes his/her clothing; after the clothing is removed, deputy searches the \nclothing articles; the male would lift his penis and scrotum to visually inspect for \n13\nanything hidden there; the inmate would be told to squat down and stand back up; \n14\nthe inmate would bend over and separate  the buttocks. Silva D. Tr. pp.19:14-21; \n15\n20:1-17. Department Search Procedures definition of strip search includes โvisual \n16\ninspection of the underclothing, female breasts, buttocks, or genitalia of such \n17\nperson.โ The policies further specify that a visual body cavity search entails a \n18\nโvisual inspection of the anus and/or vaginal areaโ in such a manner as to โexpose \n19\nbody cavity orifices.โ 3 Exhibit โ1โ. \n20\nB.  The Policy To Strip Search Those Returning From Court Entitled \n21\nto Release. \n \n22\nUntil the policy was changed after filing of this suit, those inmates who were \n23\nbeing housed in the jail, appeared in court and became entitled to release were \n24\n25\n                                           \n26\n3 Kern County Sheriffโs Department, Detentions Bureau Policies and Procedures; \n27\nSearch Procedures C-500 revised 5/4/07; Definitions, Bates #05092 Ex. โ7โ. \n  2 \n28\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 33-1    Filed 06/17/08   Page 14 of 37\n   \n1 returned to their housing location and were subjected to a strip/ visual body cavity \n2 search (โstrip/vbc searchโ). The Kern County housing units are known as Lerdo.  \n3 Sgt. Silva testified that Lerdo inmates who went to court in 2005 and were \n4 ordered released would go back to Lerdo via CRF, and would be strip searched at \nLerdo. Silva D. Tr. pp. 44:14-45; 45: 1-4. While the testimony was in reference to \n5\n2005, this was the policy in effect until October 2007. Silva D. Tr. pp.56:14-57; \n6\n57:1-7. \n7\nThe written policy for inmates going into Lerdo provided that any inmate \n8\ngoing into the general population would be strip/vbc searched. Ex. โ6โ, โLerdo \n9\nPre-Trial Divison Search Procedure,โ pg. 2 (Bates 05070). Thus, the written policy \n10\nprovided for such strip searches because post-release inmates were being returned \n11\nto the general population for out-processing. Ex. โ6โ. \n12\nC.  The Policy Of Conducting Strip Searches En Masse \n13\n \nWhen strip/vbc searches are conducted by the KCSD, which occurs every \n14\ntime that inmates are moved from Lerdo and back (see Ex. โ6โ, supra), the \n15\nsearches are routinely conducted en masse, i.e., the searches were group searches \n16\nwhere inmates were able to view the other inmates being strip searched. Silva D. \n17\nTr. pp.35:3-36; 36:1-2, D. Tr. p.51:2-10.  The Sheriffโs Department stopped both \n18\nof the foregoing policies on or about October 1, 2007. See Policy No. C-550:  Strip \n19\nand Body Cavity Searches, effective date 10-01-07, Ex. โ1โ. \n20\nIII.  CLASS REPRESENTATIVES \n21\nIn the interests of space, the facts supporting each of the named plaintiffsโ \n22\nallegations, including the facts supporting commonality, typicality and their \n23\nadequacy as class representatives, are contained in the declarations submitted \n24\nherewith. The facts are summarized here are contained in the declarations of each \n25\nplaintiff submitted with this motion, but the specific references to the relevant \n26\nparagraphs of each declaration are omitted. \n27\n  3 \n28\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 33-1    Filed 06/17/08   Page 15 of 37\n   \n1 A.  Plaintiff Marsial Lopez \n2 On or about late June 2005, plaintiff Lopez surrendered himself to out-of-\n3 state law enforcement officers upon learning that there was a Kern County felony \n4 warrant for his arrest for charges filed in the Kern County Superior Court. \nThereafter, Lopez was incarcerated in the Kern County jails, commencing late June \n5\n2005 and continuing until the first week of November, 2006. \n6\nDuring his incarceration in the Kern County jails, Kern County Sheriffโs \n7\nDepartment (โKCSDโ) deputies transported Lopez to and from the Kern County \n8\nSuperior Court for appearances on plaintiffsโ then pending criminal case. \n9\nWhenever Lopez was transported between jail facilities, and when he was returned \n10\nto jail from superior court, he was subjected to intrusive visual body cavity/strip \n11\nsearches in groups with other inmates being transported, where inmates were able \n12\nto view each others while being strip/vbc searched. The conditions in which these \n13\nsearches occurred were often unsanitary. \n14\nOn or about November 6, 2006, Lopez, still incarcerated in the Kern County \n15\njail and awaiting a retrial (in his first trial, the jury deadlocked 11-1 in favor of \n16\nacquittal), was taken before the Kern County Superior Court. At that time the \n17\nprosecuting authority dismissed all criminal charges against him. The prosecutor \n18\ndismissed the charges because the prosecutorโs office finally decided to test DNA \n19\nfound on clothing recovered from the crime scene. The DNA test results excluded \n20 him as the perpetrator of the charged crimes. \n21 After the charges were dismissed, the superior court ordered Lopezโ release. \n22 At that point KCSD deputies returned Lopez to the Kern County jail for the sole \n23 purpose of processing his release from custody. Upon arrival at the jail, Lopez was \n24 subjected to an illegal and intrusive visual body cavity/strip search, in unsanitary \nconditions, without privacy, and without reasonable suspicion that he possessed \n25\ncontraband or weapon(s). The search took place in the presence of persons not \n26\n27\n  4 \n28\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 33-1    Filed 06/17/08   Page 16 of 37\n   \n1 necessary for the search, forcing Lopez to expose his body cavities in the presence \n2 of other persons, without privacy, and in unsanitary conditions. \n3 B.  Plaintiff Sandra Chรกvez \n4 On or about February 17, 2007, plaintiff Chavez was arrested by KCSD \npersonnel, placed in KCSD custody after arrest, and transported to a Kern County \n5\njail facility.  Chavez was arrested on a charge related to fighting in public. \n6\nUpon her arrival at the jail, KCSD personnel subjected Chavez to an \n7\nintrusive strip and visual body cavity search.  During the search KCSD employees \n8\nrequired Chavez to remove all of her clothing, and to bend and squat, exposing her \n9\nanus and vagina.  Chavez was searched in a room along with approximately four or \n10\nfive other women. At the time of the search, KCSD personnel did not have \n11\nprobable cause or reasonable suspicion that Chavez or the other prisoners were in \n12\nthe possession of contraband, or any other substance that would justify or \n13\nnecessitate the strip and/or body cavity search.  A male officer, though not \n14\nparticipating in the strip search, was within view of Chavez during the search. \n15\nAfter being booked and strip searched, Chavez was given a court date and \n16\nreleased from custody.  She was not arraigned until two weeks later, where she was \n17\nsentenced to probation and a fine. \n18\nC.  Plaintiff Theodore Medina \n19\nOn or about June 7, 2006, plaintiff Medina was arrested by KCSD \n20 personnel, placed in KCSD custody after arrest, and transported to a Kern County \n21 jail facility.  Medina was arrested on a charge of public intoxication. \n22 Upon arrival at the jail, KCSD personnel subjected Medina to an intrusive \n23 strip and visual body cavity search.  During the search KCSD employees required \n24 Medina to remove all of his clothing, and to bend and squat, exposing his anus.  \nMedina was searched in a room along with approximately four or five other \n25\narrestees. At the time of the search, KCSD personnel did not have probable cause \n26\nor reasonable suspicion that Medina or the other arrestees were in the possession of \n27\n  5 \n28\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 33-1    Filed 06/17/08   Page 17 of 37\n   \n1 contraband, or any other substance that would justify or necessitate the strip and/or \n2 body cavity search.  The strip and visual body cavity search described herein \n3 occurred before Medina was arraigned. \n4 Within two years from the filing of this complaint, Medina was also arrested \non a charge of spousal abuse, placed in KCSD custody after arrest, and transported \n5\nto a Kern County jail facility.  While being booked KCSD personnel subjected \n6\nMedina to an intrusive strip and visual body cavity search, in the presence of others \n7\nnot involved in his search, and in unsanitary conditions.  After spending 17 days in \n8\na Kern County jail facility, Medina appeared in court, was sentenced to time served \n9\nand ordered released by the judge.  After the order of release, Medina was \n10\ntransferred from court to jail and, as a routine part of out-processing, was subjected \n11\nto an intrusive strip search, in the presence of others not involved in his search, and \n12\nin unsanitary conditions.  At the time of the aforementioned searches, KCSD \n13\npersonnel did not have probable cause or reasonable suspicion that Medina was in \n14\npossession of contraband, or any other substance that would justify or necessitate \n15\nthe strip and/or visual body cavity search. \n16\nIV.  CLASS DEFINITIONS \n17\n  Class One (โPost-Release Classโ) is defined as persons who, from March 27, \n18\n2005, up to October 1, 2007, or the time of judgment or settlement of the case: (a) \n19\nwere in KCSD  custody; (b) were taken from jail to court; (c) became entitled to \n20 release after going to court; and (d) were strip and/or visual body cavity searched \n21 before release pursuant to KCSDโs blanket policy, practice and/or custom to \n22 strip/vbc search all court returns, including those entitled to release.  Plaintiffs \n23 Lopez and Medina belong to and represent the Post-Release Class. \n24 Class Two (โGroup Strip Search Classโ) is defined as persons who, from \nMarch 27, 2005, up to October 1, 2007, or the time of judgment or settlement of \n25\nthe case: (a) were in KCSD custody; (b) were subjected to a strip and/or visual \n26\nbody cavity search in a group with other inmates also being strip/vbc searched, \n27\n  6 \n28\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 33-1    Filed 06/17/08   Page 18 of 37\n   \n1 which search did not afford privacy from others; and (c) whose strip searches were \n2 conducted pursuant to KCSDโs blanket policy, practice and/or custom to regularly \n3 conduct strip/vbc searches in a group setting. Plaintiffs Lopez, Chavez and Medina \n4 belong to and represent the Group Strip Search Class. \n5 V.  GENERAL CLASS ACTION CONSIDERATIONS. \nA.  Class Actions Are Particularly Suitable in Civil Rights Cases. \n6\nThe purposes of class actions are to (1) avoid multiplicity of actions and (2) \n7\nenable persons to assert small claims that could not be litigated individually \n8\nbecause the costs would far out-weigh any recovery. E.g., Crown, Cork, & Seal \n9\nCo. v. Parker, 462 US 345, 349 (1983). Class actions โconserveโ resources by \n10\npermitting an issue potentially affecting every class member to be litigated in an \n11\neconomical fashion. General Telephone Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, \n12\n155 (1982). Civil rights cases, like this one, โare often by their very nature class \n13\nsuits involving class-wide wrongs.โ East Texas Motor Freight, Inc. v. Rodriguez, \n14\n431 U.S. 395, 405 (1977).  \n15\nThe United States Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit have repeatedly \n16\nendorsed the class action procedure as the superior method of adjudicating cases \n17\nwhere there are numerous claims that are too small to litigate individually. See, \n18\ne.g., Phillips Petroleum Co v. Shutts, 472 U.S. 797 (1985); Blackie v. Barrack, 524 \n19 F.2d 891, 899 (9th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 816 (1976). Further, โcertain \n20 types of lawsuits, such as those in the criminal justice area, are inherently class \n21 actions because individual wrongs can be righted only by institutional reforms \n22 affecting an entire class of people.โ Herbert B. Newberg & Alba Conte, Newberg \n23 on Class Actions (4th ed.2002) (hereafter โNewbergโ) ยง25:25.  \n24 B.  Presumptions Applicable to Motion for Class Certification \nIn a class certification motion, plaintiffsโ allegations in the complaint are \n25\ntaken as true, and inquiry into the merits of the case is improper except to \n26\ndetermine whether there is a realistic claim. Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, supra, \n27\n  7 \n28\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 33-1    Filed 06/17/08   Page 19 of 37\n   \n1 177-78; Stanton v. Boeing, 327 F.3d 938, 954 (9th Cir. 2003) (courtโs inquiry \n2 โdoes not extend to whether plaintiff class representatives have successfully stated \n3 a cause of action or will prevail on the meritsโ); Blackie v. Barrack, 524 F.2d 891, \n4 901 (9th Cir. 1975).  \nIn a close certification case, a court should err on the side of certifying the \n5\nclass, because a class can always be decertified. Rule 23(c) (1); Blake v. City of \n6\nLos Angeles, 595 F.2d 1367, 1386 (9th Cir. 1979); Cummings v. Connell, 316 F.3d \n7\n886, 896 (9th Cir. 2003). As a result, โif there is to be an error made, let it be in \n8\nfavor and not against the maintenance of the class action, for it is always subject to \n9\nmodification should later developments during the course of the trial so require.โ \n10\nEsplin v. Hirschi, 402 F. 2d 94, 99 (10th Cir. 1968). Although class certifications \n11\nare reviewed for abuse of discretion, โan appellate courtโฆis noticeably less \n12\ndeferential, โฆ when the district court has denied class status than when it has \n13\ncertified a class.โ Parker v.

Wal-Mart, Inc., 474 F.3d 1214, 1223 (9th Cir. \n15\n2007) (greater deference given where district court certifies class). Hence, the \n16\npresumption is in favor of certification.

REQUIREMENTS UNDER FRCP 23(A). \n22 All class actions in federal court must meet the prerequisites of Rule 23(a). \n23 There are four prerequisites, each of which are satisfied in this case for all five \n24 classes: Numerosity: The class must be so numerous that joinder of all members \n25 individually is โimpracticableโ. FRCP 23(a) (1). Commonality: There must be \nquestions of law or fact common to the class. FRCP 23(a) (2). Typicality: The \n26\nclaims or defenses of the class representative must be typical of the claims or \n27\n  10 \n28\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 33-1    Filed 06/17/08   Page 22 of 37\n   \n1 defenses of the class. FRCP 23(a) (3). Adequacy of representation: The person \n2 representing the class must be able fairly and adequately to protect the interests of \n3 all members of the class. FRCP 23(a) (4).  \n4 A.  Numerosity \n5 According to the Kern County Sheriffโs website (http://www.co.kern.ca.us/ \nsheriff/detentions), Ex. โ4โ โThe Kern County Sheriff's Office, Detentions Bureau \n6\nhas an average daily inmate population of approximately 2,500 inmates. We \n7\nreceive approximately 40,000 new arrests a year.โ Thus, assuming that the \n8\nchallenged practices ceased as of October 2007, the class period is approximately \n9\n30 months, and the total processed over that time was 100,000. KCSD \n10\nclassification supervisor Sgt. Greg Gonzales, whose job in part was to maintain \n11\npopulation counts in the jails, provided ample evidence of numerosity at his \n12\ndeposition.5 Deposition of Greg Gonzales, Ex. โ9โ, at p. 4:4-20. For example, in \n13\n2006 alone 51,882 inmates were transported to and from court. Ex. โ9โ, at B-0002.  \n14\nThat same year, 44, 797 were released by the jails. Id. at B-0003.  Because all court \n15\nreturnees during the class period were strip searched en masse, and because \n16\npersons released after court were also strip searched as a matter of policy, Sgt. \n17\nGonzalesโ numbers are far above what is needed to satisfy the numerosity \n18\nrequirement.  Since Plaintiffs have not yet received the Sheriffโs computer \n19\ndatabase and the information needed to write code to determine the size of \n20\ndifferent classes, we ourselves have not generated a precise number. The requests \n21 for such data are pending, but it will probably be some time before the data has \n22\n                                           \n23\n5In response to a 30(b)(6) notice, Sgt. Gonzales generated population counts for the \n24\nclass period. Gonzales Depo, Ex. \"9\", at pp. 11:11 to 12:22. Attached hereto as Ex. \n25\n9, is a copy of the 30(b)(6) notice.  Attached hereto as Ex. 9, is a copy of Sgt. \nGonzalesโ calculations in response to each of the 30(b)(6) areas, which were also \n26\nattached as an exhibit to his deposition.\n \n27\n \n  11 \n28\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 33-1    Filed 06/17/08   Page 23 of 37\n   \n1 been obtained, understood and analyzed. See Declaration of Brian Kriegler, Ex. \n2 โ3โ, at ยถ12.   \n3 To satisfy the numerosity requirement, Plaintiffs need only show that the \n4 number is sufficiently large that it would be extremely difficult or inconvenient to \njoin all the members of the class. Comparably sized or smaller classes have \n5\nroutinely been certified. Alba Conte and Herbert B.

Commonality \n5\nMinor factual differences will not defeat a class action.  So long as it appears \n6\nunlikely โthat differences in the factual background of each claim will affect the \n7\noutcome of the legal issue, โฆ the class action device saves the resources of both \n8\nthe courts and the parties permitting an issue potentially affecting [class members] \n9\nto be litigated in an economical fashion under Rule 23.โ  Califano v. Yamasaki, \n10\n442 U.S. 682, 701 (1979).  See, also, Walters v. Reno, 145 F.3d 1032, 1045-45 (9th \n11\nCir. 1998) (existence of common legal issue with divergent factual predicates \n12\nsufficient to meet commonality requirement of Rule 23); Hanlon v. Chrysler \n13\nCorp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1019 (9th Cir. 1998) (โexistence of shared legal issues with \n14\ndivergent factual predicates is sufficient, as is a common core of salient facts \n15\ncoupled with disparate legal remedies within the classโ); Hurley v. Ward, 1979 \n16\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 8630 (S.D.N.Y. 1979) (fact that New York Department of \n17\nCorrections Services' strip search policy, applicable to all inmates, included a \n18\ngeneral authorization for practices challenged as unconstitutional provided the \n19\n\"necessary common questions, even though the specific circumstances in which it \n20\nmay be applied to individual inmates can differโ). \n21 Class certification in strip search cases, for example, does not turn on the \n22 individual circumstances of each search.  See In re Nassau County Strip Search \n23 Cases, 461 F.3d 219 (2nd Cir. 2006) (abuse of discretion to refuse to certify under \n24 23(b)(3) strip search class for liability pursuant to Rule 23 (c)(4)(A) where there \n25 was a blanket strip search policy); see generally strip search cases cited at ยง V(C) \nsupra. \n26\n27\n  13 \n28\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 33-1    Filed 06/17/08   Page 25 of 37\n   \n1 The common issues here include the existence and legality of blanket \n2 policies of (1) conducting strip/visual body cavity searches of those returned from \n3 court entitled to release before release; and (2) conducting strip/visual body cavity \n4 searches in groups where inmates could view each other during the search. \nThe Ninth Circuit, and district courts within it, has allowed the certification \n5\nof other classes where the class members have far less in common than the class \n6\nmembers here.  See, Hilao v. Estate of Ferdinand Marcos, 103 F. 3d 767, 774 (9th \n7\nCir. 1996) (allowing the certification of a class of โall current civilian citizens of \n8\nthe Republic of the Philippines, their heirs, and beneficiaries, who between 1972 \n9\nand 1986 were tortured, summarily executed or disappeared while in custody of \n10\nmilitary or paramilitary groups.โ); see, also, International Moldersโ and Allied \n11\nWorkersโ Local Union No. 164 v.

Cal. 1983) \n12\n(certifying a class of persons of Hispanic or other Latin American ancestry, \n13\nsubjected to the policies, practices and conduct of INS and/or Border Patrol during \n14\nthe course of INS area control operations directed at places of employment). \n15\nC.  Typicality \n16\nโThe commonality and typicality requirements of Rule 23(a) tend to merge.โ  \n17\nGeneral Telephone Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 157 (1982); Stanton \n18\nv. Boeing, 327 F.3d 938, 957 (9th Cir. 2003) (same).  The test of typicality is \n19\nโwhether other members have the same or similar injury, whether the action is \n20\nbased on conduct which is not unique to the named plaintiffs, and whether other \n21 class members have been injured by the same course of conduct.โ Hanon v. \n22 Dataproducts Corp., 976 F. 2d 497, 508 (9th Cir. 1992). If the representative \n23 โclaim arises from the same event, practice or course of conduct โฆ and is based \n24 upon the same legal theory, varying factual differencesโ will not render the class \n25 representativeโs claim atypical. Jordan, supra, 669 F.2d at 1321. Commonality and \ntypicality โmandate only that complainantsโ claims be common, and not in \n26\nconflict.โ Hassine v. Jeffes, 846 F.2d 169, 177 (3rd Cir. 1988). Thus, \n27\n  14 \n28\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 33-1    Filed 06/17/08   Page 26 of 37\n   \n1 โrepresentative claims are โtypicalโ if they are reasonably co-extensive with those \n2 of absent class members; they need not be substantially identical.โ Hanlon, supra, \n3 150 F.3d at 1020. \n4 Here, the main legal theories apply equally to all class representatives and \nmembers. As discussed extensively, supra, plaintiffs were subjected to \n5\nunreasonable searches in violation of their civil rights without a reasonable \n6\nsuspicion to believe they had contraband, or otherwise posed a threat to the \n7\nsecurity of the prison facility, upon release, and were strip searched in groups. \n8\nTypicality is satisfied.  \n9\nD.  Adequacy of Representation \n10\n1.  Class Representativesโ Interests Are Not Antagonistic To \n11\nThe Interests Of The Class \n12  \nThe class will be adequately represented in this action.  Rule 23(a)(4)โs \n13\nrequirement for adequate representation is met when 1) there is no conflict of \n14\ninterest between the legal interests of the named plaintiffs and those of the \n15\nproposed class; 2) counsel for the plaintiffs is competent to represent the class. \n16\nLerwill Inflight Motion Pictures, Inc., 582 F. 2d 507, 512 (9th Cir. 1978); In Re: \n17\nNorthern Dist. Of Cal Dalkon Shield Etc., 693 F. 2nd 847, 855 (9th Cir. 1982);  \n18\nStanton v. Boeing, 327 F.3d 938, 957 (9th Cir. 2003). \n19\nThe interests of all the members of the class are aligned in this action, and \n20\nthere is no anticipated or actual conflict of interests here. See Class Representative \n21\nDeclarations filed herewith.  The Defendantsโ policies and practices subjected all \n22\nof the plaintiff class to the same deprivations, and all of the plaintiffs have suffered \n23 substantially similar injuries as a result.  Moreover, the named Plaintiffs have \n24 suffered injuries that are representative of those of all of the class members. \n25 2.  Counsel Are Well Qualified To Represent The Class \n26 Plaintiffsโ counsel include Barrett Litt and Paul Estuar of the law firm of \n27 Litt, Estuar, Harrison & Kitson, LLP; Robert Mann and Donald Cook.  Counsel are \n  15 \n28\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 33-1    Filed 06/17/08   Page 27 of 37\n   \n1 experienced class action and civil rights practitioners.  Mr. Litt has handled \n2 numerous civil rights class actions, which are enumerated in his accompanying \n3 declaration and CV, including three of the four largest strip search settlements in \n4 the country. See Declaration of Barrett Litt, ยถ5.  Mr. Estuar, Mr. Mann and Mr. \nCook have been involved in many to most (in Mr. Estuarโs case) of the class cases \n5\nin which Mr. Litt has been active. Mr. Mann and Mr. Cook have also been \n6\ninvolved in class civil rights cases in which Mr. Litt has not participated. This \n7\ngroup of class counsel is among the most experienced in the country in litigation of \n8\nthe type involved here. \n9\nAll of the criteria set forth in Rule 23 (g) are present here, i.e., (a) counsel \n10\nhave identified and investigated the potential claims in the case, (b) counsel have \n11\nextensive experience in handling similar cases, (c) counsel are well versed in the \n12\napplicable law, and indeed have often made the law, and (d) counsel have the \n13\nresources necessary to prosecute the case. \n14\nVII.  REQUIREMENTS UNDER RULE 23(B) \n15\nPlaintiffs are seeking certification under all of Rule 23(b)โs provisions โ \n16\n(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3). โIn order to be maintained as a class action, a \n17\nrepresentative suit must comply with the requirements of each of the four \n18\nsubsections of Rule 23(a), and must satisfy the additional requirements of at least \n19\none of the three subdivisions of Rule 23(b).โ Newberg, ยง4:1. In addition to meeting \n20\nall the requirements for 23(a), the plaintiff class easily meets the requirements of \n21\n23(b), and specifically Rule 23(b)(2) and (3). \n22\nA.  Rule 23(b)(1)โs Requirements Are Met. \n23\nRule 23 (b)(1) provides that a class action may be maintained where \n24\nprosecution by or against individual class members would create a risk of either (a) \n25 inconsistent or varying adjudications that could establish incompatible standards, \n26 or (b) adjudication with respect to individual class members that would, as a \n27 practical matter, dispose of othersโ claims or substantially impair or impede their \n  16 \n28\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 33-1    Filed 06/17/08   Page 28 of 37\n   \n1 ability to defend their interests. A case of this type readily meets the standard of a \n2 risk of inconsistent verdicts, given that the challenge here is to a policy, and there \n3 is a risk that different triers of fact could reach different conclusions regarding the \n4 lawfulness of the policy. \n5 B.  Common Questions of Law or Fact Predominate \n6 Rule 23(b)(3) provides that class certification should be granted where โthe \nquestions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any \n7\nquestions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to \n8\nother available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.โ \n9\nDetermination of the predominance of questions of law or fact common to the class \n10\nand the superiority of a class action is to be guided by a consideration of four \n11\nfactors, (1) the interest of members of the class in individually controlling the \n12\nprosecution or defense of separate actions; (2) the extent and nature of any \n13\nlitigation concerning the controversy already commenced by or against members \n14\nof the class; (3) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of \n15\nthe claims in a particular forum; and (4) the difficulties likely to be encountered in \n16\nthe management of a class action. Rule 23(b)(3). \n17\n1.  Common Questions of Law or Fact Predominate \n18\nThe first requirement is that common factual and legal issues predominate \n19\nover any such issues that affect only individual class members.  There is no magic \n20\nformula in making this determination.  E.g., Bynum v. District of Columbia, 214 \n21\nF.R.D. 27, 41 (D.D.C. 2003) (certifying hybrid (b)(2) and (b)(3) strip search class).  \n22\nThe common questions of law or fact โpredominate over any questions affecting \n23\nonly individual membersโ in this case because the allegations of an \n24\nunconstitutional custom and practice of strip searches relate to the defendant' s \n25\nconduct, and therefore proof of liability will not vary among the class members.  \n26 See, e.g., Johnson v. District of Columbia, 2008 WL 344739, 2 (D.D.C. 2008) \n27\n  17 \n28\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 33-1    Filed 06/17/08   Page 29 of 37\n   \n1 (โCourts routinely certify strip search class actions similar to this oneโ); see \n2 generally cases cited in ยงV(C), supra. \n3 Where a common nucleus of operative facts forms the central issue in the \n4 case, even if individualized issues of proof are present, the predominance hurdle \n5 will have been cleared. See, e.g., Dornberger v. Metropolitan Life Insurance \n6 Company, 182 F.R.D. 72, 77 (S.D. N.Y. 1998) (Rule 23(b)(3) class where \n7 insurance policies sold in nine overseas countries without regulatory approval); \n8 Wells v. Allstate Insurance Co., 210 F.R.D. 1, 12 (D.D.C. 2002) (Rule 23(b)(3) \n9 class certified where common questions predominated in consumer action \n10 involving denial of insurance claims); Rossini v. Olgivy & Mather, 798 F.2d 590, \n11 598-599 (2d Cir. 1986) (reversing decertification of Rule 23(b)(3) class as to \n12 employee claims of sex discrimination in training and promotion alleging pattern \n13 and practice of employer). Here, the common policies described above provide that \n14 common nucleus. As mentioned above, (b)(3) certifications are common in strip \n15 search cases due to the predominance of a particular policy or approach to a \n16 particular demonstration.  \n17 Generally speaking, if the action complained of on behalf of the putative \n18 class members arises out of a single set of operative facts, then the commonality \nrequirement will have been satisfied.  If that common nucleus of operative facts \n19\nforms the central issue in the case, even if individualized issues of proof are \n20\npresent, the predominance hurdle will have been cleared.  See, e.g., Rossini v. \n21\nOlgivy & Mather, 798 F.2d 590, 598-599 (2d Cir. 1986) (reversing decertification \n22\nof Rule 23(b)(3) class as to employee claims of sex discrimination in training and \n23\npromotion alleging pattern and practice of employer); see generally cases cited in \n24\nArgument V (C), supra. \n25\n26\n27\n  18 \n28\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 33-1    Filed 06/17/08   Page 30 of 37\n   \n1 There are at least two key questions, one of fact and one of law, common to \n2 members of each of the proposed classes: (a) whether the County has a particular \n3 strip search policy and (b) whether the policy violates the Constitution.  \n4 The resolution of both these questions would dispose of the liability issue.  This \nsuffices to show that common questions of law and fact predominate over any \n5\nquestions affecting individual class members. E.g., Bynum, 214 F.R.D. at 39.  \n6\n2.  Once a Common Policy Or Law Is Established, the Burden \n7\nShifts To The Defendants To Identify Exceptions. \n8  \nIt is well established in strip search cases that, once Plaintiffs establish an \n9\nunlawful policy, the burden shift to defendants to affirmatively identify individuals \n10\nwho were justifiably strip searched despite the existence of the unlawful policy. \n11\nSee, e.g., Doe v. Calumet City, Illinois, 754 F.Supp. 1211, 1220 (N.D.Ill. 1990) \n12\n(plaintiffs not required to show that defendants lacked reasonable belief that \n13\nindividual plaintiffs were concealing weapons or contraband where plaintiffs had \n14\nshown the strip-search policy to be routine and indiscriminate); Mack v. Suffolk \n15\nCounty, 191 F.R.D. 16, 24 (D.Mass. 2000) (where a blanket strip search policy \n16\nexisted, defendants had burden to demonstrate that particular searches were \n17\nreasonable); Blihovde v. St. Croix County, Wis., 219 F.R.D. 607, 621 -\n18\n622 (W.D.Wis. 2003) (following Mack and Doe, supra); Tardiff v. Knox County, \n19\n365 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2004) (recognizing that several courts have found where \n20\nthere is a blanket policy the burden shifts to the defendants to point out the \n21\nexceptions to the rule, but not deciding the issue except to say that, whoever had \n22\nthe burden, it would not defeat class certification); In re Nassau County Strip \n23\nSearch Cases, 461 F.3d 219, 230-31 (2nd Cir. 2006) (defense that some plaintiffs \n24\nwere properly strip searched not defeat class certification). See also International \n25\nBrotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324 (1977) (when plaintiffs in \n26\ndiscrimination action prove that defendants engaged in pattern or practice of \n27 discrimination, burden of persuasion shifts to defendants to prove individual \n  19 \n28\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 33-1    Filed 06/17/08   Page 31 of 37\n   \n1 actions were not discriminatory); Hervey v. City of Little Rock, 787 F.2d 1223, \n2 1228 (8th Cir.1986) (applying pattern or practice method of proof to claim brought \n3 under ยง1983); Anderson v. Cornejo, 199 F.R.D. 228, 240-41 (N.D.Ill.2000) \n4 (assuming that pattern and practice method of proof applies to class actions \n5 involving strip search policies). \n3.  Predominance on a Single Issue is Enough to Satisfy 23(b)(3) \n6\nRule 23(c)(4) provides that โwhen appropriate (A) an action may be brought \n7\nor maintained as a class action with respect to particular issues.โ Thus, the court \n8\ncould certify the class for liability purposes only, or for a determination of certain \n9\nspecified liability issues, leaving other liability issues (although here there are \n10\nnone) and damages for individual determination. See, e.g., 7A Charles Alan Wright \n11\n& Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure ยง1778 (2d ed. 1986) (\"when \n12\none or more of the central issues in the action are common to the class and can be \n13\nsaid to predominate, the action will be considered proper under Rule 23(b)(3) even \n14\nthough important matters will have to be tried separately\"); Valentino v. Carter- \n15\nWallace, Inc., 97 F.3d 1227, 1234 (9th Cir. 1996) (โeven if the common questions \n16\ndo not predominate over the individual questions so that class certification of the \n17\nentire action is warranted, Rule 23 authorizes the district court in appropriate cases \n18\nto isolate the common issues under Rule 23(c)(4)(A) and proceed with class \n19\ntreatment of these particular issues.โ); In re Nassau County Strip Search Cases, \n20\n461 F.3d 219, (abuse of discretion to refuse to certify 23(b)(3) strip search class for \n21\nliability only under Rule 23 (c)(4)(A) where there was a blanket strip search \n22\npolicy; on remand, district court should reconsider whether damages component \n23\nshould be certified) (citing Valentino); Sterling v. Velsicol Chemical Corp., 855 \n24\nF.2d 1188, 1196-97 (6th Cir. 1988) (\"no matter how individualized the issue of \n25\ndamages may be . . . the mere fact that questions peculiar to each member of the \n26\nclass remain after the common questions of the defendant's liability have been \n27 resolved does not dictate the conclusion that a class action is impermissible\"). \n  20 \n28\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 33-1    Filed 06/17/08   Page 32 of 37\n   \n1 In In Re Nassau County Strip Search Cases, supra, 2006 WL 2441023, the \n2 Second Circuit reversed as an abuse of discretion the district courtโs denial of class \n3 certification in a case involving a blanket strip search policy, indicating that the \n4 requirements of Rule 23(b)(3) were met even if damages were not certified due to \nindividual considerations because Rule 23(c)(A)(4) provided for certification of \n5\nindividual issues. In doing so, the Court characterized the issue as โwhether a court \n6\nmay employ Rule 23(c)(4)(A) to certify a class as to a specific issue where the \n7\nentire claim does not satisfy Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance requirementโ In \n8\nanswering the question in the affirmative (and indeed holding it was an abuse of \n9\ndiscretion not to do so), the Second Circuit cited Valentino, supra, a Ninth Circuit \n10\ncase. It emphasized that, as here, the class โdefinition referenced only defendants' \n11\nโblanket policy,โ thus avoiding questions of probable cause.โ Id. at p.9. Thus, at a \n12\nminimum, certification should be granted on the liability issues. \n13\n4.  Damages Do Not Defeat Predominance in this Case. \n14\nThe First, Second, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh and Eleventh Circuits, have \n15\nrecently reaffirmed that the mere existence of individual damages issues in a (b)(3) \n16\nclass does not cause individual issues to predominate over common issues on \n17\nliability or causation so as to justify denying certification of the class when the \n18\nliability issue is susceptible of class proof.

See, e.g., Carnegie v. \n2 Household Int'l , Inc., 376 F.3d 656, 661 (7th Cir.2004) (Posner, J.) (โit may be \n3 that if and when the defendants are determined to have violated the law separate \n4 proceedings of some character will be requiredโ, but that โprospect need not defeat \n5 class treatmentโ; after a liability determination favorable to the class, โa global \nsettlement โฆ will be a natural and appropriate sequelโ; and if not, โRule 23 allows \n6\nโฆ imaginative solutions,โ including bifurcation of liability and damages, \n7\nappointing a magistrate judge or special master to preside over individual damages \n8\nproceedings, decertifying class for subsequent proceedings, and others) 6.  \n9\nBifurcation of liability and damage determinations is well recognized. See, \n10\ne.g., Chang v. U.S., 217 F.R.D. 262, 272 (D.D.C. 2003) (โdistrict court, should, of \n11\ncourse, ordinarily consider such well-established methods as bifurcating the trial \n12\ninto liability and damages phases before denying certification,โ quoting McCarthy \n13\nv.

Allied Van Lines, Inc., 231 F.R.D. 280, 284 -85 (N.D.Ill. 2005). \n22\n7 As long as separate juries do not re-examine previously resolved fact \n23\ndeterminations, Rule 42(b) and the Seventh Amendment permit trials of individual, \ndiscrete issues before separate juries. Robinson v. Metro-North Commuter R.R., \n24\n267 F.3d 147, 170 (2nd Cir. 2001); Mullen v. Treasure Chest Casino, LLC, 186 \n25\nF.3d 620 (5th Cir. 1999).

Arkansas Log \n27\nHomes, Inc., 1989 WL 18755, 1 (D.Kan. 1989) (bifurcated issue of causation in \n  22 \n28\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 33-1    Filed 06/17/08   Page 34 of 37\n   \n1 In this case, there are several readily available approaches to damages \n2 should settlement not be possible after a class-wide liability determination. \n3 a)  Classifying Damages \n4 Damages could be tried as a whole, with the jury placing values on certain \n5 categories of damages (e.g., the value of a strip search of a 1) first time arrestee, 2) \n6 men versus women, 3) those who suffered particular psychological distress, 4) \nthose who were mentally ill, those who were searched under particularly difficult \n7\ncircumstances, such as while menstruating, and the like). A grid could be \n8\ndeveloped, and the jury could place values on these or other categories of damages. \n9\nPlaintiffs are not specifically proposing these categories, but use them as \n10\nillustrations. See, e.g., Dellums v. Powell, 566 F.2d 167 (D.C.Cir.1977) (damages \n11\nset by category: for false arrest based on categories of detention of up to 12 hours, \n12\n12-24 hours, 24-48 hours, and 48-72 hours; additional fixed amount of damages \n13\nfor violation of First Amendment rights, cruel and unusual punishment, and \n14\ncategories of malicious prosecution: court did not โthink that determination of \n15\ndamages in this case requires individualizationโ; instead, they โwere fixed either \n16\nfor the class as a whole or by subclassโ); Allaptatah Services v. Exxon, 157 \n17\nF.Supp.2d 1291, 1313 (S.D. FLA 2001) (\"it is appropriate for the class \n18\nrepresentatives to develop and prove common guidelines or formulae that will \n19\napply for each individual proof of claims.\") (citing Newberg, ยง10.01 and Hilao, v. \n20\nEstate of Marcos, 103 F.3d 767 (9th Cir. 1996)). \n21\n22\n                                                                                                                                        \n23\nEPA case); Paine, Webber, Jackson & Curtis, Inc. v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, \n24\nFenner & Smith, 587 F.Supp. 1112, 1117 (D.Del.1984) (patent infringement \n25\nbifurcated into liability and damages trials); Carroll-McCreary Co., Inc. v. New \nJersey Steel Corp., 1981 WL 2030 (E.D.N.Y. 1981) (no โneat dividing lineโ \n26\nbetween the issues of liability and damages in antitrust case; bifurcation \n27\npermissible under Seventh Amendment). \n  23 \n28\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 33-1    Filed 06/17/08   Page 35 of 37\n   \n1 b)  Bellwether Trials \n2 Alternatively, the court could hold bellwether or test trials to aid settlement, \n3 if the parties cannot agree. See, e.g., MCL, supra, ยง22.91, p.448 (โparties may \n4 agree to use test-case trials to establish a range of value for resolving similar \n5 claimsโ); In re Chevron, 109 F.3d 1016, 1019 (5th Cir. 1997) (notion that \n6 bellwether trials may enhance settlement prospects or help resolve common \nquestions โis a sound oneโ); In re Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE) Products, \n7\n2007 WL 1791258 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (ordering bellwether trials on representative \n8\nclaims despite defendantsโ objections).\n9\nc)  Statutory Damages \n10\nIn this case, individual damage issues may be obviated by the availability of \n11\nstatutory minimum damages of $4,000 per violation under Californiaโs Unruh Act, \n12\nCivil Code ยง52.  Section 52 is the remedies section of the Act. Thus, although ยง52 \n13\nitself only address certain violations of ยง51 (not including ยง52.1), ยง52.1(b) \n14\nexpressly incorporates the remedy provisions of ยง52(a) making statutory damages \n15\navailable for a violation of ยง52.1. When and if the stage of the litigation were \n16\nreached where a violation of ยง52.1 were determined, plaintiffs would then propose \n17\nthat class members have the choice of accepting the statutory damages or opting \n18\nout, which would effectively eliminate the need to determine individual damages at \n19\nall.  \n20\nThe propriety of applying a pre-determined mathematical formula to class \n21\ncompensatory damages is well-established. See, e.g., Six (6) Mexican Workers v. \n22 Arizona Citrus Growers, 904 F.2d 1301, 1305-1306 (9th Cir. 1990) (where plaintiff \n23\nclass sought statutory not actual damages, they were intended โto promote \n24 enforcementโ of the underlying statute [there the FLCRA] and โdeter future \n25 violationsโฆ. Therefore, the district court was not obligated to require individual \n26 proof of injury from each class member.โ); Windham v. American Brands, Inc., \n27 565 F.2d 59, 68 (4th Cir.1977). \n  24 \n28\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 33-1    Filed 06/17/08   Page 36 of 37\n   \n1 d)  Statistical Methods of Determining Damages \n2 The Ninth Circuit has endorsed the use of special and innovative methods to \n3 allow a damages class to proceed, including specifically statistical sampling. Hilao \n4 v. Estate of Marcos, 103 F.3d 767, 774 (9th Cir. 1996) (class action against \n5 Fernando Marcos for of torture, \"disappearance,\" or summary execution that \noccurred over a 14 year period based on randomly selected sample comports with \n6\nthe historical understanding of both procedural and substantive due process). 8 See \n7\nalso, e.g., Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Jersey, Inc. v. Philip Morris, Inc., \n8\n113 F. Supp.2d 345, 372-376 (E.D.N.Y. 2000) and 2001 WL 1304370, p.43 \n9\n(E.D.N.Y. 2001) (Weinstein, D.J.) (health plans could use statistical evidence in \n10\nsupport of their claim for damages due to unlawful conduct of Phillip Morris).  \n11\nC.  Manageability and the Role of Kern Countyโs Sheriffโs Database. \n12\nBecause Kern County maintains a database which contains the essential \n13\ninformation in (a) determining class membership and (b) contacting class \n14\nmembers, there should be little or no manageability concerns in certifying this case \n15\nas a class action. \n16\nLieutenant Dennis Smithson, the Countyโs Rule 30(b)(6) designee regarding \n17\nits inmate management system called the Criminal Justice Information System or \n18\nโCJISโ, testified that CJIS identifies every person presently in Kern County \n19\nSheriffโs custody, identifies what criminal matters are pending against an inmate, \n20\nidentify whether an inmate has any warrants or holds placed on him/her, identify \n21\nwhen an inmate is eligible for release. Smithson Depo., Ex. 10, pp.18:19-25 to  \n22\n                                           \n23\n8 For an extensive analysis of statistical sampling, see Michael J. Saks and Peter \n24\nDavid Blanck, Justice Improved: THE UNRECOGNIZED BENEFITS OF \n25\nAGGREGATION AND SAMPLING IN THE TRIAL OF MASS TORTS, 44 Stanford \nLaw Review 815 (1992); Laurens Walker & John Monahan, Sampling Damages, \n26\n83 Iowa L.Rev. 545 (1998) (โa complete solution of the numbers problem in mass \n27\ntorts can only be achieved by ยทยทยท randomly sampling damages without apology.โ). \n  25 \n28\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 33-1    Filed 06/17/08   Page 37 of 37\n   \n1 19:1-6.  Using CJIS, one can generate a list of everyone who was held in custody \n2 at a Kern County detention facility for a given period of time, and can further limit \n3 that list, for example, to only felony bookings. Smithson Depo., Ex. 10, p.24:15-25 \n4 to 26:1-10. CJIS also allows to not only extract a record of all releases, but can also \nidentify the reason for a particular release. Smithson Depo., Ex. 10, p.28:13-15. \n5\nIt is clear that all the information necessary to determine class membership \n6\nis maintained by the County in its computer records.  In addition, plaintiffs have \n7\nretained the services of a statistical expert, Brian Kriegler, who has extensive \n8\nexperience analyzing highly sensitive and confidential inmate data from law \n9\nenforcement databases in strip search cases, as he has acted as an expert for \n10\nPlaintiffsโ counsel in several strip search class actions for purposes of determining \n11\nclass membership and ultimately class damages through statistical means (e.g., \n12\nusing statistical sampling of class members as a basis for drawing conclusions \n13\nabout the whole class).  There should be little concern about manageability of this \n14\ncase as a class action. See Declarations of Barrett S. Litt and Brian Kriegler. \n15\nVIII. CONCLUSION \n16\nFor the foregoing reasons, plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court grant \n17\ntheir Motion for Class Certification. \n18\nDated: June 16, 2008      Respectfully submitted, \n19\n            LITT, ESTUAR, HARRISON   \n            & KITSON, LLP \n20\n \n21\n \n            __/s/  Barrett S.

INTRODUCTION \n2 1.  This action concerns the manner in which prisoners are searched in Kern  \n3 Countyโs jails, alleging, inter alia, violations of the Fourth, Eighth and Fourteenth \n4\nAmendments of the United States Constitution, and their corollaries under the \n5\nCalifornia Constitution.   \n6\n2.   The gravamen of this complaint concerns the privacy rights of prisoners \n7\nwho are routinely subjected to strip and/or visual body cavity searches in violation \n8\nof the constitutions and laws of the United States and the State of California. \n9\nII.   JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n10\n3.   Plaintiffs present federal claims for relief under 42 U.S.C. ยง1983. \n11\nAccordingly, federal jurisdiction is conferred upon this Court by 28 U.S.C.          \n12\nยงยง1331 and 1343.  Plaintiffsโ state law claims are so related to the federal law \n13\nclaims that they form part of the same case or controversy.  Accordingly, \n14\nsupplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims is conferred upon this Court by \n15\n28 U.S.C. ยง1367. \n16\n4.   Plaintiffsโ claims arise out of acts of the Kern County Sheriffโs Department \n17\nin the County of Kern, State of California, in and about Bakersfield, California.  \n18\nAccordingly, venue is proper within the Eastern District of California. \n19\nIII.   PARTIES \n20\n  Plaintiffs \n21\n5.   Plaintiff Marsial Lopez, a male, is and was at all times relevant hereto, a \n22\n23 resident of the County of Kern, State of California. \n24 6.  Plaintiff Sandra Chavez, a female, is and was at all times relevant hereto, a \n25 resident of the County of Kern, State of California. \n26 7.  Plaintiff Theodore Medina, a male, is and was at all times relevant hereto, a \n27 resident of the County of Kern, State of California. \n28  \n  2\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 10    Filed 06/21/07   Page 3 of 17\n   \n1   Defendants \n2 8.  Defendant County of Kern (โCountyโ) is a public entity organized and \n3 existing under the laws of the State of California.  Defendant Kern County \n4\nSheriffโs Department (โKCSDโ) is a public entity within the meaning of California \n5\nlaw, and is a County agency.  These defendants are sued in their own right for a \n6\nCounty and/or KCSD policy, practice or custom which caused plaintiffsโ injuries \n7\nin violation of one or more federal constitutional guarantees, and on plaintiffsโ \n8\nstate law claims based on respondeat superior, under California Government Code \n9\nยง815.2 and mandatory duties under California Government Code ยง815.6. \n10\n9.  Defendant Donny Youngblood (โYoungbloodโ) is the Sheriff of Kern \n11\nCounty, and is the policy maker for the KCSD. He is sued in his official and \n12\nindividual capacities. \n13\n10.   Defendant Mack Wimbish (โWimbishโ) is the former sheriff for Kern \n14\nCounty, and is Youngbloodโs predecessor. Plaintiffs sue Wimbish in his individual \n15\ncapacity only.  \n16\n11.   Plaintiffs are ignorant of the true names and capacities of defendants sued \n17\nherein as DOES 1 through 100, inclusive, and therefore sues these defendants by \n18\nsuch fictitious names. Plaintiffs will give notice of this complaint, and of one of \n19\nmore DOESโ true names and capacities, when ascertained. Plaintiffs are informed \n20\nand believe and based thereon allege, that defendants DOES 1 through 100 are \n21\nresponsible in some manner for the damages and injuries hereinafter complained \n22\n23 of. \n24 12.  DOES 1-50 (hereinafter collectively referred to as โKCSD Supervisory \n25 defendantsโ) were and are now responsible for the KCSD jails and, among other \n26 things, are responsible for the training, supervision, control, assignment and \n27 discipline of the sworn and civilian personnel of the KCSD and County who work \n28 in, operate, administer and manage the jails, and for the formulation, promulgation, \n  3\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 10    Filed 06/21/07   Page 4 of 17\n   \n1 adoption, application, administration and enforcement of the policies, rules, \n2 regulations and practices of the KCSD jails. \n3 13.  Upon information and belief, plaintiffs further allege that, at all times \n4\nrelevant herein, the KCSD Supervisory defendants participated in, approved, \n5\nand/or ratified the unconstitutional or illegal acts complained of herein that \n6\noccurred within KCSD jails.  \n7\n14.  DOES 51-100 were and are now KCSD employees and/or agents \n8\nresponsible for the implementation of the policies, rules, regulations and practices \n9\nof the KCSD jails, and include KCSD employees who actually implemented and \n10\nenforced the unlawful policies and practices complained of herein. \n11\n15.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege that, at all times \n12\nrelevant herein, the individual defendants, and each of them, were the agents, \n13\nservants and employees of their respective employers (defendants KCSD, County) \n14\nand were acting at all times within the scope of their agency and employment, and \n15\nwith the knowledge and consent of their principals and employers. At all times \n16\nherein, defendants, and each of them, were acting under the color of state law. \n17\nIV.   CLAIMS OF CLASS REPRESENTATIVES \n18\n  Plaintiff Marsial Lopez \n19\n16.  On or about late June 2005, plaintiff Lopez surrendered himself to out-of-\n20\nstate law enforcement officers upon learning that there was a Kern County felony \n21\nwarrant for his arrest for charges filed in the Kern County Superior Court. \n22\n23 Thereafter, Lopez was incarcerated in the Kern County jails, commencing late June \n24 2005 and continuing until the first week of November, 2006. \n25 17.  During his incarceration in the Kern County jails, KCSD deputies \n26 transported Lopez to and from the Kern County Superior Court for appearances on \n27 plaintiffsโ then pending criminal case. Whenever Lopez was transported between \n28 jail facilities, and when he was returned to jail from superior court, he was \n  4\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 10    Filed 06/21/07   Page 5 of 17\n   \n1 subjected to intrusive visual body cavity/strip searches. That is, in the presence of \n2 others not necessary for the searches and without any privacy, Lopez was forced to \n3 remove all of his clothing, expose his body cavities in the presence of other \n4\npersons, in unsanitary conditions. \n5\n18.  On or about November 6, 2006, Lopez, still incarcerated in the Kern County \n6\njail and awaiting a retrial (in his first trial the jury deadlocked 11-1, in favor of \n7\nacquittal) was taken before the Kern County Superior Court. At that time the \n8\nprosecuting authority dismissed all criminal charges against him. The prosecutor \n9\ndismissed the charges because the prosecutorโs office finally decided to test DNA \n10\nfound on clothing recovered from the crime scene. The DNA test results excluded \n11\nhim as the perpetrator of the charged crimes. \n12\n19.  After the charges were dismissed, the superior court ordered Lopezโ release. \n13\nAt that point KCSD deputies returned Lopez to the Kern County jail for the sole \n14\npurpose of processing his release from custody. Upon arrival at the jail, Lopez was \n15\nsubjected to an illegal and intrusive visual body cavity/strip search, in unsanitary \n16\nconditions, without privacy, and without reasonable suspicion that he possessed \n17\ncontraband or weapon(s). The search took place in the presence of persons not \n18\nnecessary for the search, forcing Lopez to expose his body cavities in the presence \n19\nof other persons, without privacy, and in unsanitary conditions. \n20\n20.  Lopez has timely filed a claim under Government Code ยง910 with the \n21\nCounty of Kern, both on behalf of himself and other persons similarly situated. \n22\n23   Plaintiff Sandra Chavez \n24 21.  On or about February 17, 2007, plaintiff Chavez was arrested by KCSD \n25 personnel, placed in KCSD custody after arrest, and transported to a Kern County \n26 jail facility.  Chavez was arrested on a charge related to fighting in public. \n27 22.  Upon her arrival at the jail, KCSD personnel subjected Chavez to an \n28 intrusive strip and visual body cavity search.  During the search KCSD employees \n  5\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 10    Filed 06/21/07   Page 6 of 17\n   \n1 required Chavez to remove all of her clothing, and to bend and squat, exposing her \n2 anus and vagina.  Chavez was searched in a room along with approximately four or \n3 five other women. At the time of the search, KCSD personnel did not have \n4\nprobable cause or reasonable suspicion that Chavez or the other prisoners were in \n5\nthe possession of contraband, or any other substance that would justify or \n6\nnecessitate the strip and/or body cavity search.  A male officer, though not \n7\nparticipating in the strip search, was within view of Chavez during the search. \n8\n23.  After being booked and strip searched, Chavez was given a court date and \n9\nreleased from custody.  She was not arraigned until two weeks later, where she was \n10\nsentenced to probation and a fine. \n11\n24.  Chavez has timely filed a claim under Government Code ยง910 with the \n12\nCounty of Kern, both on behalf of herself and other persons similarly situated. \n13\n  Plaintiff Theodore Medina \n14\n25.  On or about June 7, 2006, plaintiff Medina was arrested by KCSD \n15\npersonnel, placed in KCSD custody after arrest, and transported to a Kern County \n16\njail facility.  Medina was arrested on a charge of public intoxication. \n17\n26.  Upon arrival at the jail, KCSD personnel subjected Medina to an intrusive \n18\nstrip and visual body cavity search.  During the search KCSD employees required \n19\nMedina to remove all of his clothing, and to bend and squat, exposing his anus.  \n20\nMedina was searched in a room along with approximately four or five other \n21\narrestees. At the time of the search, KCSD personnel did not have probable cause \n22\n23 or reasonable suspicion that Medina or the other arrestees were in the possession of \n24 contraband, or any other substance that would justify or necessitate the strip and/or \n25 body cavity search.  The strip and visual body cavity search described herein \n26 occurred before Medina was arraigned. \n27 27.  Within two years from the filing of this complaint, Medina was also arrested \n28 on a charge of spousal abuse, placed in KCSD custody after arrest, and transported \n  6\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 10    Filed 06/21/07   Page 7 of 17\n   \n1 to a Kern County jail facility.  While being booked KCSD personnel subjected \n2 Medina to an intrusive strip and visual body cavity search, in the presence of others \n3 not involved in his search, and in unsanitary conditions.  After spending 17 days in \n4\na Kern County jail facility, Medina appeared in court, was sentenced to time served \n5\nand ordered released by the judge.  After the order of release, Medina was \n6\ntransferred from court to jail and, as a routine part of out-processing, was subjected \n7\nto an intrusive strip search, in the presence of others not involved in his search, and \n8\nin unsanitary conditions.  At the time of the aforementioned searches, KCSD \n9\npersonnel did not have probable cause or reasonable suspicion that Medina was in \n10\npossession of contraband, or any other substance that would justify or necessitate \n11\nthe strip and/or visual body cavity search. \n12\nV.   CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n13\n28.  Plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalf, and on behalf of a class of all \n14\nother persons similarly situated, pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil \n15\nProcedure. The class is defined as those persons who, in the two years preceding \n16\nthe filing of this action, and up until the date of class certification, or such other \n17\ndate as the Court may set, were forced to undergo unlawful strip and/or visual body \n18\ncavity searches in Kern Countyโs jails which are operated, maintained and under \n19\nthe control of the County, the KCSD and the Supervisory defendants. \n20\n29.  On information and belief, plaintiffs allege the strip and/or visual body \n21\ncavity searches to which they and class members were subjected, were done \n22\n23 pursuant to defendantsโ policy and practice to indiscriminately search all or a large \n24 number of persons being processed into the jail without regard to: a) The nature of \n25 their offense or criminal history; b) Whether they are under an order of release or \n26 not; c) Whether they have had contact with any persons from outside the County \n27 jail system who could reasonably be believed to be a potential source of \n28 contraband or weapons; d) Whether there is cause of any kind to believe they are a \n  7\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 10    Filed 06/21/07   Page 8 of 17\n   \n1 potential source of contraband or weapons; e) Whether there is any other \n2 articulable justification for defendantsโ indiscriminate strip and body search policy; \n3 or f) Whether they are โprearraignment detainees,โ as that term is used in \n4\nCalifornia Penal Code ยง4030(b). \n5\n30.  On information and belief, plaintiffs allege that defendants have a policy of \n6\nnot limiting the persons who can see or hear or observe all or part of the strip and \n7\nbody cavity searches to those who are necessary to the procedure. Thus, other \n8\ninmates, members of the opposite six, dispensable jail personnel and possibly \n9\nothers are able to see and/or hear some or all of the searches described below.  \n10\nSpecifically, class members are required to submit to strip and/or body cavity \n11\nsearches during which other people, who are not participating in the search and \n12\npossibly are of the opposite sex, including jail staff and other inmates, are able to \n13\nobserve the search and the class membersโ naked bodies.  In many instances, class \n14\nmembers are forced to touch each otherโs bodies during the searches. \n15\n31.  On information and belief, plaintiffs allege that defendants will continue \n16\ntheir aforementioned policy and practice of unlawful strip and/or visual body \n17\ncavity searches unless enjoined and restrained by the court.  Without injunctive \n18\nrelief applicable to the class as a whole, the class members will suffer irreparable \n19\nharm for which there is no adequate remedy at law in that their constitutional and \n20\nstatutory rights will be systematically violated. \n21\nVI.   RULE 23 PREREQUISITES \n22\n23   A.  Numerosity \n24 32.  In accordance with F.R.Civ. P. Rule 23(a), the members of the class are so \n25 numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. Plaintiffs do not know the \n26 exact number of class members. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon \n27 allege that there are more than 50 prisoners per day who are subjected to strip \n28 and/or body cavity searches as a result of defendantsโ policies and practices of \n  8\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 10    Filed 06/21/07   Page 9 of 17\n   \n1 indiscriminately subjecting prisoners to strip and body cavity searches. Plaintiffs \n2 are informed and believe and thereon allege that the number of persons in the \n3 proposed class is in the thousands. \n4\n  B.  Common Issues of Fact or Law \n5\n33.  In accordance with F.R. Civ. P. Rule 23(a), there are questions of fact \n6\ncommon to the class. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege that the \n7\ncommon questions of fact include, but are not limited to the following: (1) \n8\nWhether the KCSD routinely subjects all prisoners to strip and/or body cavity \n9\nsearches without there being any reasonable suspicion, based on specific or \n10\narticulable facts, to believe any particular inmate has concealed drug(s), weapon(s) \n11\nand/or any contraband on their persons or in their body cavities; (2) Whether the \n12\nstrip and/or body cavity searches are conducted in an area of privacy so that the \n13\nsearch cannot be observed by persons not participating in the search, or whether \n14\nthe strip and body cavity searches are conducted in areas where they may be \n15\nobserved by persons not participating in the searches; and (3) Whether the strip \n16\nand/or body cavity searches are conducted in an unsanitary area, infested with \n17\nbacteria such as MRSA and other communicable diseases. \n18\n34.  In accordance with F.R. Civ. P. Rule 23(a), there are questions of law \n19\ncommon to the class.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege that \n20\nthe common questions of law include but are not limited to the following: (1) \n21\nWhether the KCSD may indiscriminately conduct strip and/or body cavity searches \n22\n23 of inmates without there being any reasonable suspicion, based on specific or \n24 articulable facts, to believe any particular inmate has concealed drug(s), weapon(s) \n25 and/or any contraband on their persons or in their body cavities; (2) Whether the \n26 KCSD may conduct strip and/or body cavity searches of inmates in open areas \n27 where they may be observed by persons not participating in the searches; (3) \n28 Whether KCSDโs policy of subjecting persons to strip and/or body cavity searches \n  9\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 10    Filed 06/21/07   Page 10 of 17\n   \n1 violates California Penal Code ยง4030; (4) Whether KCSDโs policy of subjecting \n2 persons to strip and/or body cavity searches in an area which is not an โarea of \n3 privacyโ violates California Penal Code ยง4030(m); (5) Whether the conduct \n4\ndescribed above violates the Fourth and/or Fourteenth Amendments, and/or \n5\nCalifornia Constitution Article I, ยงยง1, 7, and/or 13; (6) Whether the conduct \n6\ndescribed above constitutes a policy or custom of the defendants; (7) Whether any \n7\nindividual defendant is entitled to qualified immunity on the federal claims, or state \n8\nlaw immunity on the state law claims, for the practices complained of herein; and \n9\n(8) Whether determination of damages suffered by a statistically representative \n10\nsample of the class provides the basis for determination of all class membersโ \n11\ndamages except those who opt out. \n12\n  C.  Typicality \n13\n35.  In accordance with F.R. Civ. P. Rule 23(a), the claims of the representative \n14\nPlaintiffs are typical of the class. Plaintiffs were in KCSD custody when he was \n15\nsubjected to at least one strip and/or visual body cavity searches without there \n16\nbeing any reasonable suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts, to believe \n17\nthat plaintiffs and class members had concealed drug(s), weapon(s) and/or any \n18\ncontraband in their body cavities; plaintiffs were subjected to searches in open \n19\nareas where they were observed by other prisoners and persons not involved in the \n20\nsearch, possibly including sometimes members of the opposite sex; plaintiffs were \n21\nsearched and forced to stand naked in unsanitary and bacteria infested areas. \n22\n23 36.  Thus, plaintiffs have the same interests and have suffered the same type of \n24 damages as the class members. Plaintiffsโ claims are based upon the same or \n25 similar legal theories as the claims of the class members. Each class member \n26 suffered actual damages as a result of being subjected to a strip and/or body cavity \n27 search. The actual damages suffered by plaintiffs are similar in type and amount to \n28 the actual damages suffered by each class member. \n  10\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 10    Filed 06/21/07   Page 11 of 17\n   \n1 37.  In accordance with F.R. Civ. P. Rule 23(a), the representative plaintiffs will \n2 fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. The interests of the \n3 representative plaintiffs are consistent with and not antagonistic to the interests of \n4\nthe class. \n5\n   D.  Maintenance and Superiority \n6\n38.  In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(1)(A), prosecutions of separate \n7\nactions by individual members of the class would create a risk that inconsistent or \n8\nvarying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class would \n9\nestablish incompatible standards of conduct for the parties opposing the class. \n10\n39.  In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(1)(B), prosecutions of separate \n11\nactions by individual members of the class would create a risk of adjudications \n12\nwith respect to individual members of the class which would, as a practical matter, \n13\nsubstantially impair or impede the interests of the other members of the class to \n14\nprotect their interests. \n15\n40.  In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(2), plaintiffs are informed and \n16\nbelieve and thereon allege that the defendants have acted on grounds generally \n17\napplicable to the class. \n18\n41.  In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(3), the questions of law or fact \n19\ncommon to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting \n20\nonly individual members, and this class action is superior to other available \n21\nmethods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy between the \n22\n23 parties.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege that the interest of \n24 class members in individually controlling the prosecution of a separate action is \n25 low, in that most class members would be unable to individually prosecute any \n26 action at all.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege that the \n27 amounts at stake for individuals are such that separate suits would be impracticable \n28 in that most members of the class will not be able to find counsel to represent \n  11\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 10    Filed 06/21/07   Page 12 of 17\n   \n1 them. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege that it is desirable to \n2 concentrate all litigation in one forum because all of the claims arise in the same \n3 location, i.e., the County of Kern, and it will promote judicial efficiency to resolve \n4\nthe common questions of law and fact in one forum, rather than in multiple courts. \n5\n42.  Plaintiffs do not know the identities of the class members. Plaintiffs are \n6\ninformed and believe and thereon allege that the identities of the class members are \n7\nascertainable from KCSD records, in particular the KCSD computer system used \n8\nto track and identify KCSD inmates. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and \n9\nthereon allege that the computer system reflects the identities, including addresses \n10\nand telephone numbers, of the persons who have been held in custody by KCSD; \n11\nwhen inmates were arrested and booked, taken to court, returned from court; why \n12\ninmates were released; and when inmates were released.  \n13\n43.  Plaintiffs know of no difficulty that will be encountered in the management \n14\nof this litigation that would preclude its maintenance as a class action.  The class \n15\naction is superior to any other available means to resolve the issues raised on \n16\nbehalf of the class.  The class action will be manageable because so many different \n17\nrecords systems exist from which to ascertain the members of the class. Liability \n18\ncan be determined on a class-wide basis. Damages can be determined on a class-\n19\nwide basis using a damages matrix set by a jury, or by trying the damages of a \n20\nstatistically valid sample of the class to a jury and extrapolating those damages to \n21\nthe class as a whole. \n22\n23 44.  In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(3), class members must be \n24 furnished with the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including \n25 individual notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort.  \n26 Plaintiffs are informed and believe that KCSD computer records contain a last \n27 known address for class members.  Plaintiffs contemplate that individual notice be \n28 given to class members at such last known address by first class mail. Plaintiffs \n  12\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 10    Filed 06/21/07   Page 13 of 17\n   \n1 contemplate that the notice inform class members of the following: \n2 a.  The pendency of the class action, and the issues common to the class; \n3 b.  The nature of the action; \n4\nc.  Their right to โopt outโ of the action within a given time, in which \nevent they will not be bound by a decision rendered in the class \n5\naction; \n6\n \n7 d.  Their right, if they do not โopt out,โ to be represented by their own \ncounsel and enter an appearance in the case; otherwise, they will be \n8\nrepresented by the named plaintiffs and his counsel; and \n9  \ne.  Their right, if they do not โopt out,โ to share in any recovery in favor \n10\nof the class, and conversely to be bound by any judgment on the \n11 common issues, adverse to the class. \n \n12\n45.  Plaintiffs restate and incorporate by reference each of the foregoing \n13\nparagraphs in each of the following causes of action as if each paragraph was fully \n14\nset forth therein. \n15\n  COUNT ONE - 42 U.S.C. ยง1983 \n16\n  (All Defendants) \n17\n46.  In subjecting plaintiffs and class members to the unnecessary, demeaning, \n18\noutrageous and intrusive strip and/or body cavity searches, defendants, and each of \n19\nthem, violated plaintiffsโ and class membersโ rights to be secure in their persons \n20\nagainst unreasonable searches and seizures as guaranteed by the Fourth and \n21\nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Therefore, plaintiffs \n22\n23 and class members are entitled to bring suit and recover damages pursuant to 42 \n24 U.S.C. ยง1983. \n25   COUNT TWO - EQUAL PROTECTION \n26   (All Defendants) \n27 47.  The unnecessary, demeaning, outrageous and intrusive strip and/or body \n28 cavity searches deprived plaintiffs and class members of the protections afforded \n  13\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 10    Filed 06/21/07   Page 14 of 17\n   \n1 by provisions of the 14th Amendment Equal Protection guarantees. Therefore, \n2 plaintiffs and class members are entitled to bring suit and recover damages \n3 pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง1983. \n4\n  COUNT THREE - Cal. Const., Art. I ยงยง7, 13 \n5\n  (All Defendants) \n6\n48.  The unnecessary, demeaning, outrageous and intrusive strip and/or body \n7\ncavity searches to which plaintiffs and class members were subjected violated \n8\nplaintiffsโ rights not to be denied equal protection of the law, as guaranteed by \n9\nArticle I, ยง 7 of the California Constitution; and to be secure in their persons \n10\nagainst unreasonable searches and seizures, as guaranteed by Article I, ยง 13 of the \n11\nCalifornia Constitution. \n12\n  COUNT FOUR - Cal. Civ. Code ยง52.1 \n13\n  (All Defendants) \n14\n49.  The unnecessary, demeaning, outrageous and intrusive strip and/or visual \n15\nbody cavity searches were accomplished via threats, intimidation and/or coercion. \n16\n50.  The unnecessary, demeaning, outrageous and intrusive strip and/or visual \n17\nbody cavity searches deprived plaintiffs and the class they represent of the \n18\nprotections afforded by provisions of federal constitutional and state constitutional \n19\nand statutory law, including but not limited to rights protected under the Fourth, \n20\nEighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; Article I,   \n21\nยงยง1, 7, 13, and 17, of the California state constitution, and California Penal Code  \n22\n23 ยง4030.  Therefore, plaintiffs and the class are entitled to bring suit and recover \n24 damages pursuant to Cal. Civ. Code ยง52.1(b). \n25 51.  As a direct and proximate cause of the aforementioned acts, plaintiffs and \n26 class members were damaged in an amount to be proven at trial but in any event \n27 not less than $4,000 per violation pursuant to the provisions of Civil Code ยง52(b). \n28\n  14\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 10    Filed 06/21/07   Page 15 of 17\n   \n1 52.  The aforementioned acts of defendants directly and proximately caused \n2 plaintiffs to be deprived of their California constitutional rights as stated above, \n3 thereby entitling plaintiffs and class members to recover damages proximately \n4\ncaused by defendantsโ wrongful acts. \n5\n  COUNT FIVE - Violation of Statutory Duties, Penal Code ยง4030 \n6\n  (Against All Defendants) \n7\n53.  The unnecessary, demeaning, outrageous, and intrusive strip and/or body \n8\ncavity searches to which plaintiffs and the class members were subjected by \n9\ndefendants, violated plaintiffsโ and the class membersโ state-law protections \n10\nguaranteed by California Penal Code ยง4030 and equal protection guarantees. \n11\n54.  Although by its terms Penal Code ยง4030 only applies to misdemeanor \n12\narrests, there is no reason to establish different standards for how a strip is \n13\nconducted in order to maintain the arresteeโs privacy while allowing the strip \n14\nsearch based on whether arrestee is charged with a misdemeanor or a felony. \n15\nAccordingly, equal protection and due process of law under the Federal and \n16\nCalifornia Constitutions require that the manner of strip search protections \n17\ncontained in Penal Code ยง4030 apply to felony arrestees as well as misdemeanor \n18\narrestees. \n19\n55.  Any violation of a California statute is mandatory and prohibitory. \n20\n56.  The aforementioned acts of defendants directly and proximately caused the \n21\nplaintiffs and the class members to be deprived of their rights as stated above, \n22\n23 thereby entitling plaintiffs and class members to recover damages proximately \n24 caused by defendantsโ wrongful acts, including statutory damages under Penal \n25 Code ยง 4030. \n26   COUNT SIX- Violation of Mandatory Duties \n27   (Against All Defendants) \n28 57.  The Fourth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \n  15\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 10    Filed 06/21/07   Page 16 of 17\n   \n1 Constitution; Article I, ยงยง1, 7, 13, and 17, of the California state constitution; \n2 California Penal Code ยง4030; and California Civil Code ยง52.1 are enactments.  \n3 Enactments form the basis of a mandatory duty under California Government Code \n4\nยง815.6. \n5\n58.  These constitutional provisions and statutes apply to all members of the \n6\ngeneral public, including plaintiffs, and were all designed to prevent the kind of \n7\ninjuries alleged herein. \n8\n59.  Defendants did not exercise reasonable diligence in discharging their duty to \n9\nrefrain from violating the constitutional rights of plaintiffs and class members. \n10\n60.  As a direct and proximate cause of the aforementioned acts of defendants, \n11\nplaintiffs and class members were damaged in amounts to be determined at trial. \n12\nVII.   PRAYER \n13\n  WHEREFORE, plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and the class members \n14\nthey represent, request the following against each defendant as follows: \n15\n61.  General and special damages according to proof; \n16\n62.  Temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief prohibiting \n17\ndefendants from continuing to engage in the unlawful practices complained \n18\nof herein; \n19\n63.  As against the individual defendants only, punitive damages according to \n20\nproof; \n21\n64.   In addition to actual damages, statutory damages as allowed by law, \n22\n23 including Penal Code ยง4030 and Civil Code ยงยง52 and 52.1; \n24  \n25  \n26  \n27  \n28  \n  16\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 10    Filed 06/21/07   Page 17 of 17\n   \n1 65.

Similar to the other searches in this case that Plaintiffs have\n11 challenged, th~ undisputed evidence relevant to this motion clearly establishes that the searches of I\ni\n12 these Plaintiffs upon their return to the jail from an outside, unsecure setting was reasonable and\nthe security needs related to having to place the detainees back in the jail's\n13 appropriate in light of \n14 general population for holding during the delay between the time the detainees were returned to the\n15 jail and when the jail finally received the court order directing their release from custody.\n16 Defendants also move for judgment on behalf of individual Defendants Y oungblood and\n17 Wimbish. Defendants maintain their position, as stated in their first Motion for Summary\n18 Adjudication, that searching post-arraignment detainees in small groups does not violate Plaintiffs'\n19 rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, nor do these searches violate the Equal\n20 Protection Clause simply because California law prohibits similar searches from being conducted\n21 as to pre-arraignment arrestees. However, to the extent that any question may exist as to the\n22 constitutionality of these security-based practices, Defendants Youngblood and Wimbish are\n23 immune from liabilty because the law is not clearly established that such practices violate\n24 constitutional rights.\n25 Finally, Defendants' motion also pertains to the status of the Sheriff as a State actor with\n26 respect to the searches of detainees whom the court has ordered to be released. The actions at issue\n27 II in this lawsuit are directly tied to the statutory mandate the State has issued to the Sheriff as to\n28 enforce the laws of the State of California. Moreover, in holding these inmates, the Sheriff acts on\nPORTER SCOTT\n1\nDEFENDANTS' MSA RE: QUALIFIED IMMUNITY AND ELEVENTH AMENDMENT\nw'wwporrerscol/com 00622819,WPD\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 64    Filed 11/07/08   Page 8 of 27\n1 behalf of the State of California because he is beholden to the Superior Cour in awaiting its\n2 disposition of each detainee's case. In so doing, the Sheriff stands in place of the State of California\n3 in maintaining custody of these detainees such that he is immune from suit in this matter pursuant\n4 to the Eleventh Amendment. Because the Sheriff is a state actor, none of the actions at issue in\n5 regard to this particular putative class can be attributed to the County and therefore the County\n6 should be dismissed from this action in that regard as an improper party.\n9 II.\n7 Based upon the clear evidence and legal precedent discussed herein, Defendants respectfully\n8 request that their Motion for Summary Adjudication in regard to these enumerated issues be granted.\n10 FACTS\n11 Inmates housed at the Lerdo facility of the Kern County Jail (\"jail\") are required to be\n12 transported to one of the Kern County Superior Court locations to appear regarding the criminal\n13 charges against them. See Defendants' Joint Separate Statement of Undisputed Material Facts\n14 (UMF), UMF 1. Hundreds of inmates are transported to court each day from the Lerdo facility.\n15 UMF 2. Sometimes at a cour appearance, the court orders that the inmate should be released. UMF\n16 3. Reasons for the release may include release on the inmate's own recognizance, posting bailor\nthe criminal charges. UMF 4. However, when the court orders the inmate to\ni 7 complete dismissal of \n18 be released, it does so only on the matter or matters before it. UMF 5. In other words, the court does\n19 not consider other reasons or cases that the inmate may be in custody. UMF 6. Therefore, an order\n20 of release does not necessarily mean that the inmate may be released from custody at that time. UMF\n21 7.\n22 When the court issues an order of  release, the clerk of  the court enters the court's order into\n23 the local computerized Criminal Justice Information System (\"CJIS\"), as well as the reason for the\nthe clerk's\n24 order of  release. UMF 8. The clerk may enter the order at any time before the end of \n25 work day. UMF 9. Almost always, the inmate has returned to the Lerdo facility before the clerk has\n26 entered the order into CJIS. UMF 10. The Detention Deputies who transport the inmates to and from\nthe court's orders regarding release because they do not provide courtroom\n27 the court are not aware of \n28 security. UMF 11. After the clerk enters the information, CJIS creates a \"flag\" on the inmate's CJIS\nPORTER SCOTT\n2\nDEFENDANTS' MSA RE: QUALIFIED IMMUNITY AND ELEVENTH AMENDMENT\nwwporierscotl.com 00622819WPD\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 64    Filed 11/07/08   Page 9 of 27\nto locate the flag, they must run a C,JIS search to pull the\n1 record. UMF 12. However, for jail staff \n2 records with the specific, court-entered flag. UMF 13. Generally, jail staff runs the report hourly to\nthe inmates have a flag that indicates that the court has ordered the inmate to be\n3 determine which of \n4 released on the charge on which the inmate appeared. UMF 14.\n5 Once jail staff runs the CJIS search for the inmates ordered released by the court, each of\n6 these inmate records must be checked to determine whether there are other reasons for the inmate\n7 to remain in jaiL. UMF 15. Reasons for holding the inmates after a court-ordered release on a\n8 particular criminal case may include the existence of other ongoing criminal cases, holds or warrants.\n9 UMF 16. To conduct this check, the local CJIS system must be searched, as well as the statewide\n10 computer system, the California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (known as\n11 I \"CLETS\"). UMF 17. Ifit is determined that there is no other basis for the inmate to be retained in\ni\n1211 the jail, then the inmate is released. UMF 18.\n13 the time delay between the inmates' return from court and the court clerk's entries\nBecause of \n14 of the release orders, there was no way for the custodial staff to know which of the inmates were\n15 going to be released following to their appearances in court. UMF 19. Moreover, there was no way\n16 to know which of those inmates that were ordered to be released would not,\nfor the j ail custodial staff \n17 in actuality, be eligible for release. UMF 20. As a result, inmates returning from court had to be re-\n18 housed in the jaiL. UMF 21. Inmates had to be re-housed at the jail for numerous reasons. As stated,\n19 there was no way to know at the time that the inmates returned to Lerdo from their court appearances\n20 who would ultimately be released from custody. UMF 22. In addition, the Lerdo facility has no way\n21 to temporarily segregate and house the large number of inmates who are transported to and from\n22 court each day. UMF 23. To segregate and temporarily house the inmates returning from court, the\n23 Lerdo facility would have to have sufficient holding cells for each classification of prisoner because\n24 inmates of different housing classifications cannot be held together; commingling of different\nthe facility.\n25\nclassifications poses a safety risk to the inmates and a threat to the internal security of \n26 UMF 24. For example, members of opposing gangs cannot be housed together due to the likelihood\n27 of ensuing violence. UMF 25. Even commingling inmates of the same classification in close\n28 time that is required to determine whether an inmate may be released from\nquarters for the amount of \nPORTER SCOTT\n3\nDEFENDANTS' MSA RE: QUALIFIED IMMUNITY AND ELEVENTH AMENDMENT\nwwporferscoftcom 00622819.WPD\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 64    Filed 11/07/08   Page 10 of 27\n1 custody poses the potential for a violent exchange between inmates, which is a serious threat to the\njail staffing\n2 jaiL. UMF 26. In addition, as explained in Defendants' first motion, there is insuffcient \n3 to provide even the minimum amount of security necessary for any such \"temporary\" housing unit.\n4 UMF 27.\n5 When the inmates were transported to and from the court, they had contact with other inmates\n6 from their jail unit, other units and other Lerdo facilities on the transport bus and while at the\n7 courthouse. i UMF 28. Given the amount of contraband that the jail's custodial offcers find, they\n8 have reasonably concluded that the contraband is largely obtained as a result ofthe contact with other\n9 inmates during the court transports. UMF 29. For example, inmates somehow obtain portions of\n10 latex gloves, in particular the fingers of the gloves, and use the latex to envelop contraband. UMF\n11 1130. Inmates commonly place the contraband in their rectums for transport back to the Lerdo facility.\ntheir bodies while at court.\n1211 UMF 31. However, inmates also hide contraband in or on other areas of \n13 UMF 32. For example, in a widely publicized incident in 2007, convicted mass-murderer Vincent\n14 Brothers managed to secret a fabricated handcuff key in his hair during a visit to court. UMF 33.\n15 This key was discovered during a strip search of his person. UMF 34. This example serves to\n16 ilustrate that because of contact between inmates, it was necessary to strip searched the inmates\n18 III.\n17 upon their return to the jaiรญ prior to being re-housed. UMF 35.\n19 LEGAL STANDARD\n20 If there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment\n21 as a matter of law, then the court must make an order granting the movant's motion for summary\n22 judgment.

Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 585-87 (1986).

Neither the\n22 corrections offcers escorting the detainees to and from the courthouse nor the offcers stationed in\n23 the jail facility know whether a detainee has been ordered released at the time the detainee returns\n24 to the jail, requiring that the returning detainees are placed back into jail general population until\n25 further information is received later in the day. As established in Defendants' first motion for\n26 summary adjudication, the Kern County jail is full and the inmate-to-staff ratios have become\n27 increasingly imbalanced; further, space in the jail is extremely limited. The jail has concluded that\n28 its best option to maintain immediate security needs is to place all prisoners back into the general\nPORTER SC OTT\n6\nDEFENDANTS' MSA RE: QUALIFIED IMMUNITY AND ELEVENTH AMENDMENT\nww.ponerscott.com 00622819.wPD\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 64    Filed 11/07/08   Page 13 of 27\n1 population until proper notification of release is received from the court. Because the prisoners wil\n2 be sent back to general population, internal security needs mandate that all inmates be searched so\n3 that contraband is not introduced into the facility. Indeed, it is only appropriate and necessary that\n4 all inmates returning to the jail be strip searched before they are placed back into the general\n5 population. This is the only means by which Defendants can locate any of the contraband that\n6 undisputedly exists and which the inmates may have obtained while outside the facility and prevent\n7 it from being passed to other detainees within the jaiL. Accordingly, pursuant to Bell, the search is\nthe inmates as a matter oflaw.

When considering a defendant's motion for summary judgment on the ground of qualified\n23 immunity, the court first must determine whether the offcial's conduct violated a constitutional\n24 right. Saucier v. Katz 533 U.S. 194,201 (2001).2 If so, the court next must consider whether the\n25 right claimed to be violated was clearly established at the time of the allegedly improper act. Id.

Id. at 199. If so, then\n3 summary judgment must be granted on the grounds of qualified immunity.\n4 A right is \"clearly established\" for qualified immunity purposes when the contours of the\n5 right are \"suffciently clear that a reasonable offcial would understand that what he is doing violates\n6 that right.\" Saucier, 533 U.S. at 202. To determine whether qualified immunity applies, the court\nthe right in the specific context in question. See Redding v. Safford\n7 must consider the application of \n8 Unified Sch.

Defendants Youngblood and Wimbish are Entitled to Qualified Immunity in Regard\nto the Issue of Group Searches\n15\n1. Qualified immunity should be applied to the Fourth Amendment claims specific\n16 to the group searches.\n17 In their first Motion for Summary Adjudication, Defendants moved for judgment with respect\n18 to all claims ofthe putative class pertaining to strip searches of post-arraignment detainees in small\n19 groups. In that Motion, Defendants noted that there is no clearly established case law that specifically\n20 proscribes the use of group strip searches of post-arraignment detainees.3 Indeed, in their Opposition\n21 to that Motion, Plaintiffs were unable to identify any case that specifically prohibited group searches\n22 of post-arraignment detainees. Thus, there is no basis for finding that Defendants' actions were\n23 unconstItutional and Plaintiffs' claims in this regard therefore must fail as a matter of law.\n24 III\n25 III\n26\n27\n3Defendants incorporate by reference their legal arguments and case law cited in their Motion for Summary\n28 Adjudication as to the group search issue (Docket No. 37), as well as their Reply (Docket No. 58) to the\nOpposition to the Motion, as though fully restated herein.\nPORTER SCOTT\n8\nDEFENDANTS' MSA RE: QUALIFIED IMMUNITY AND ELEVENTH AMENDMENT\nwww.ponerscolt.รงom\n00622819.WPD\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 64    Filed 11/07/08   Page 15 of 27\nAssuming arguendo the court concludes that group strip searches of post-arraignment\n1\n2 detainees may violate the constitution, Defendants are nevertheless entitled to qualified immunity.\n3 There is no extant legal precedent that \"point(s) unmistakably to the unconstitutionality of the\n4 conduct complained of and (is) so clearly foreshadowed by applicable direct authority as to leave no\n5 doubt in the mind of a reasonable officer that his conduct, if challenged on constitutional groups,\n6 would be found wanting.\" Virgili v. Gilbert 272 F.3d 391,393 (6th Cir. 2001). In fact, a recent\n\\\n7 case from the Western District of Kentucky specifically granted qualified immunity to individual\n8 officers arising out of claims of groups strip searches, finding that there was no clearly established\n9 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23055\nlaw that would prohibit the searches. Hughes v. City of  Louisville \n10 (W.D. Ky. 2007);4 see Bookerv. Horton 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15825 (W.D.

It is apparent that there is no clearly established law that would have\n16 post-arraignment\nplaced Defendants Youngblood and Wimbish on notice that conducting searches of \n17 detainees in small groups would violate any aspect of the Constitution. Accordingly, Defendants\n18 Youngblood and Wimbish are entitled to qualified immunity in regard to this aspect of Plaintiffs'\n19 First Amended Complaint and Defendants therefore request that their motion pertaining to this claim\n20 be granted.\n21 2. Qualified immunity should be applied to Plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment\nclaims specific to the group searches\n22\n23 As also discussed in Defendants' Motion and Reply, there is no legal support for Plaintiffs'\n24 claim that Defendants' practice in search procedures violates the Due Process Clause.

Absent evidence of express punitive intent, the Ninth\n4 Circuit has noted that \"to constitute punishment, the harm or disability caused the governent's\n5 action must either significantly exceed, or be independent of, the inherent discomforts of\n6 to Plaintiffs' Fourth\nconfinement.\" Demery v. Arpaio, 378 F.3d 1020, 1030 (9th Cir. 2004). Similar \n7 Amendment Claim, there simply are no facts to suggest that any ofthe Plaintiffs were strip searched\n8 as a means for punishment - whether they were searched alone or while in a small group. The\n9 rational basis for conducting the strip search is permitted for security concerns as a matter of law.\n10 the staff constraints proportionate\nThe need for these searches to be conducted as a group in light of \n11 I to inmate population. There are no facts to indicate that strip searching inmates in front of other\n121 inmates was punishment, nor can it be said that the group searches significantly exceed the inherent\n13 discomforts of confinement. Therefore, because there is no constitutional violation of Plaintiffs'\n14 rights, no further legal inquiry is necessary for purposes of qualified immunity. See County of\n15 Sacramento v. Lewis, supra.\n16 Assuming arguendo the Court determines that a question exists as to whether a constitutional\n17 violation occurred in conjunction with the group searches, Defendants Youngblood and Wimbish\n18 also are entitled to qualified immunity in regard to this claim. Again, as with Plaintiffs' Fourth\n19 Amendment claim, there is no clearly established law that would have placed these Defendants on\n20 notice that performing the searches in small groups would violate the Fourteenth Amendment rights\n21 of their prisoners. There is no clear legal precedent that would have indicated to Youngblood and\n22 Wimbish that small-group searches significantly exceeded or were independent of the \"inherent\n23 discomforts\" of confinement. Demery 378 F.3d at 1030. Without such clear legal directives, notice\n24 of any wrongdoing cannot be imputed to these Defendants and they therefore are entitled to qualified\n25 immunity as a matter of law.\n26 1/1\n27 /11\n28 III\nPORTER I SCOTT\nATTORNEYS 10\nDEFENDANTS' MSA RE: QUALIFIED IMMUNITY AND ELEVENTH AMENDMENT\nWW\\'porterscotl.com\n006228 i 9.wPD\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 64    Filed 11/07/08   Page 17 of 27\n3. Defendants Youngblood and Wimbish are entitled to qualified immunity in\n1\nregard to Plaintiffs' equal protection claims\n2\n3 In their first Motion for Summary Adjudication, Defendants addressed Plaintiffs' contention\n4 that the treatment of post-arraignment detainees as compared to pre-arraignment arrestees with\n5 respect to strip searches violated the Equal Protection Clause. In that regard, Plaintiffs never\n6 asserted assert that Defendants violated Section 4030, nor can they do so. Indeed, Section 4030\n7 applies only \"only to prearraignment detainees arrested for infraction or misdemeanor offenses.\"\n8 CaL. Penal Code ยง 4030. Section 4030 was enacted to regulate booking searches - a fact which\n9 Plaintiffs failed to refute or even address in their Opposition to Defendants' Motion. As stated in\n10 Defendants' prior Motion, the undisputed evidence establishes that only post-arraignment prisoners\n11 were ever subjected to strip searches, whether alone or in a group; because Section 4030 applies only\ni\n12 II to arrestees who are strip searched prior to arraignment, the claims asserted by Plaintiffs or any party\n13 they purport to represent as part of a class in this regard fails as a matter of law. Moreover, as\n14 Defendants noted in their first Motion, Plaintiffs have failed to establish the fudamental legal\n15 requirements to support an Equal Protection claim: post-arraignment detainees are not similarly\n16 situated to pre-arraignment arrestees and any differential treatment was not based on their\n17 membership in a legally protected class. Finally, Defendants clearly demonstrated that any group\n18 searches survive rational basis review and do not violate the detainees' constitutional rights.\n19 However, assuming arguendo the court concludes that a constitutional violation may exist\n20 as to any differential treatment, Defendants Youngblood and Wimbish are entitled to qualified\n21 immunity with respect to Plaintiffs' Equal Protection Clause claim. It was not and is not clearly\n22 established that differentiating search procedures and practices between pre-arraignment arrestees\n23 and post-arraignment detainees is unconstitutional or otherwise improper. In fact, the California\n24 State Legislature established the basis for any difference in treatment between these two groups when\n25 it enacted California Penal Code Section 4030, which, by its plain language applies to and provides\n26 protections only to pre-arraignment misdemeanant arrestees. Section 4030 has never been declared\n27 unconstitutional and therefore Defendants reasonably and justifiably relied on the distinctions\n28 between prisoner groups provided for therein. Moreover, there is no legal precedent that would have\nPORTER SCOTT\n11\nDEFENDANTS' MSA RE: QUALIFIED IMMUNITY AND ELEVENTH AMENDMENT\nwwporterscott.com\n00622819WPD\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 64    Filed 11/07/08   Page 18 of 27\n1 placed Defendants notice that such differentiation in searches was unconstitutionaL. Without any\n2 clear legal guideposts to define these parameters, Defendants Youngblood and Wimbish are entitled\n3 to qualified immunity as a matter of law and therefore request that their motion in this regard be\n4 granted.\n5 B. Defendants Youngblood and Wimbish Are Entitled to Qualified Immunity Regarding\nthe Searches of Detainees upon Return from Court Appearances after They Were\n6 Ordered Released\n7 Assuming arguendo the court finds a question of fact as to whether the searches of the\n8 returning detainees is constitutional, Defendants Youngblood and Wimbish nevertheless are entitled\n9 to qualified immunity. There is no clearly established case law that would have placed Youngblood\n10 and/or Wimbish on notice that this protocol was in any way unconstitutionaL. All relevant case law\n11 reflects that searches of inmates returning to a detention facility from outside its secure setting are\npreventing introduction of contraband into the facility. Moreover, there\n12 reasonable as a means of \n13 is no clearly established law that requires that a detention facility know the status of detainees\n14 returning from court or that they somehow be segregated and held indefinitely until their status is\n15 conclusively determined. Without any applicable legal requirements stating that the established\ni 6 practices of the KCSO are unconstitutional, Defendants Youngblood and Wimbish had no way to\n17 know that their policies would violate clearly established law. Thus, these individual Defendants\n18 respectfully submit that they are entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law and request that\n219 their M1otion be  granted Vwith respIect to all .claims regarding the searches of detainees returning from\n20 court who have been ordered released.\n22 THE SHERIFF IN HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY IS A POLICYMAKER FOR THE\nSTATE OF CALIFORNIA, NOT THE\n23 COUNTY OF KERN, AND THUS IS IMMUNE FROM SECTION 1983 LIABILITY\nPURSUANT TO THE ELEVENTH AMENDMENT\n24\n25 A.

Accordingly, their actions in performing the functions of \n23 respective positions cannot expose the counties in which they work to liability for alleged violations\n24 of ยง 1983 because a State is not a \"person\" who is subject to suit under that statute. The California\n25 Supreme Court affirmed McMilian in regard to both District Attorneys and Sheriffs in Venegas.\n26 The Venegas Court reiied upon McMilian and other related state cases in holding that in all matters\n27 related to investigation of crime, training of subordinate officers and staff, and options for crime\n28 the State in enforcing its laws and thus is a State\nfighting tactics, the County Sheriff acts on behalf of \nPORTER SC OTT\n14\nDEFENDANTS' MSA RE: QUALIFIED IMMUNITY AND ELEVENTH AMENDMENT\nwww.porterscotrcom 00622819.WPD\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 64    Filed 11/07/08   Page 21 of 27\n1 actor. 32 Cal.4th at 830-839. Under McMilian, whether a particular official has policy making\n2 authority is dependent upon an analysis of state law; California Constitution, Article V, Section 13,\n3 provides that sheriffs and district attorneys are actors of the state, under the supervision of the\n4 California Attorney General, which is reinforced by the Venegas Court's decision determining\n5 sheriffs to be state actors.\n6 The State of California charges Sheriffs with preserving the peace, \"participat(ingJ in any\n7 project of crime prevention, rehabilitat(ingJ of persons previously convicted of crime\" and to\n8 \"prevent(ingJ and suppress(ingJ any affrays, breaches of the peace, riots and insurrections.\" CaL.\n9 Govt.

See Govt. Code ยงยง 26601,26602. In addition, persons detained at the jail have been\n16 arested for committing crimes violating state law and are awaiting trial, have already been\n17 convicted of and sentenced for violating state law andlor are detained as witnesses or under orders\n18 of civil process or contempt. In essence, the Sheriff promulgates and maintains policies to ensure\n19 that violators of California law are held to answer the charges fied against them by the district\n20 attorney, who acts on behalf of the State, in the Superior Court, which is a division of the State.\n21 Because the functions of the Sheriff in this case can only be classified as benefitting and occurring\nthe State ofCalifornia, the Sheriff cannot be classified as being a policymaker for Kern\n22 on behalf of \n23 County.

County of  Los Angeles, 236 F.3d 552 (9th Cir. 2001), the Court \n3 Department was subject to ยง 1983 liability because the sheriff acted for the County as the jail\n4 administrator when he set policy for conducting prisoner release record checks. The policy at issue\n5 in Streit is distinguishable from the conduct at issue in the instant case. There, the Court found that\n6 the sheriff acted for the county when he established a policy whereby prisoners were not released\n7 until after all recent warrants and holds were checked - a purely administrative function. In contrast,\n8 the instant case concerns the coordination of efforts to maintain the peace and safety of citizens who\n9 happen to be detained in the jail, as the Sheriff is mandated to do by California law and under the\n10 direction of the California Attorney General. Notably, Streit observed that courts analyzing\nEleventh Amendment immunity are to avoid a \"categorical all or nothing approach.\"\n11 application of \n12 II Id. An inquiry must be made on a case-by-case basis to determine whether governmental offcials\n13 are final policymakers for the local government in a particular area or on a particular issue. Id.\n14 Here, to the extent that the Defendant Sheriffs established any type of policy regarding the\n15 strip searches, it was a policy established on behalf ofthe State of California to maintain prisoners'\n16 safety while charges were pending against them or to incarcerate them on behalf of the State after\n17 they were convicted. The anticipated criminal prosecutions for which the detainees are held in the\n18 jail do not benefit Kern County, but instead benefit the People of the State of California. The\n19 Eastern District of California has already granted Eleventh Amendment immunity to Sheriffs in a\n20 Sacramento, 2008 U.S.Dist.LEXIS 12460 (E.D. CaL.\ncustodial setting. See McNeely v.

Smith\nis\n10 v. County  of  San  Mateo, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13253 (N.D. CaL. 1999). In sum, the Sheriff \n11 responsible by California statute to hold and maintain the detainees safety until a court of the State\nCalifornia forwards the appropriate order for their release. Thus, there can be no dispute that in\n1211 of \n13 this limited scope the Sheriff is acting for and on behalf of the State of California and therefore he\n14 is entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity for his actions as to this particularly group of prisoners.\n15 The decisions in Brewster v. Shasta County, 275 F.3d 803 (9th Cir. 2001) and Bishop Paiute\n16 Tribe v. County ofInyo, 275 F.3d 893 (9th Cir. 2002), vacated, do not preclude finding that Sheriff\n17 Youngblood is a state actor. In Brewster, the Ninth Court held that the Shasta County Sheriff acted\n18 as a final policymaker for the county specifically when he was alleged to have manipulated a witness,\n19 failed to test physical evidence and failed to disclose exculpatory evidence. Brewster, 275 F.3d at\n20\n21 that right to speedy trial under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution had been violated.

Placer County was not a part to the proceedings which had\nwarrant that plaintiff \nresulted in Plaintiffs release from custody in Sacramento County.

Coverdell v. Dep't of Social & Health Servs., 834 F.2d 758, 764-65 (9th Cir. 1987). This is\n28 particularly true here, where the Sheriff is beholden to the superior court to engage in any conduct at all and,\nthe court until the necessary release paperwork is received.\nPORTER SCOTT in fact, holds the prisoners at the behest of \n17\nDEFENDANTS' MSA RE: QUALIFIED IMMUNITY AND ELEVENTH AMENDMENT\nwww.porlerscoll.com\n00622819,WPD\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 64    Filed 11/07/08   Page 24 of 27\n1 812.

Bishop\n2 obtained and executed a search warrant that was alleged to be in excess of \n3 Paiute Tribe, 275 F.3d 909-910. First, the conduct at issue in Brewster and Bishop is entirely\n4 distinguishable from the conduct at issue in this case as in the instant case, as Defendant Youngblood\n5 is not being sued for conduct he engaged in while fulfilling investigatory duties. Instead, he is being\n6 sued solely for his activities in promulgating policy affecting prisoners charged with violation of\n7 California law as he is required to do by California statute.\n8 Of significant importance, the Ninth Circuit decidecBreit, Brewster and Bishop well before\n9 the California Supreme Court considered precisely this same issue in Venegas v. County of Los\n10 Angeles, supra. As noted above, in deciding a McMilian issue, a reviewing court is required to 100k\n11 to state constitutions, statute and relevant case law. The Venegas Court engaged in a pure McMilian\n12 analysis regarding Sheriffs in California acting as State officials in regard to enforcing the Penal\n13 Code, concluding that they are shielded by Eleventh Amendment immunity in ยง 1983 actions. See\n14 Id. at 828-30. In so concluding, the Venegas Court analyzed various portions of the California\n15 Constitution and Government Code statutes and reviewed and relied upon its own prior ruling in\n16 Pitts v. County of Kern, in which the Court held that those very same statutes provided Eleventh\n17 Amendment immunity to District Attorneys of the various counties in California, thus warranting\n18 extension ofthe immunity to Sheriffs. Id. The Ninth Circuit has repeatedly relied on Pitts in holding\n19 that District Attorneys in California are immune from ยง 1983 liability. See, e.g., Ceballos v. Garcetti,\n20 361 F.3d 1168, 1182-83 (9th Cir. 2004) (relying on Pitts and holding that \"a district attorney is a\n21 state official when he acts as a public prosecutor. . .

Those same statutes that led the California Supreme Court\n26 to find Eleventh Amendment immunity applicable to District Attorneys are the same statutes that\n27 led that same Court to apply the immunity to Sheriffs in California - the same cases now utilized by\n28 the Ninth Circuit.\nPORTER SCOTT\n18\nDEFENDANTS' MSA RE: QUALIFIED IMMUNITY AND ELEVENTH AMENDMENT\nwwwpol1er.icotlcom\n00622819 WPD\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 64    Filed 11/07/08   Page 25 of 27\n1 There is plainly an inconsistency and split of authority between the laws and judicial\nCalifornia and the rulings ofthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals regarding\n2 precedent of  the State of \n3 application of Eleventh Amendment immunity to California Sheriffs, particularly since the Ninth\nthe state.'''

It is\n1 Amendment, a factor that 'subsumes all others' is the treatment of \n2 only common sense to conclude that if the Ninth Circuit recognizes the authority of the California\n3 Supreme Court as being the \"ultimate interpreter\" of state law in regard to District Attorneys under\n4 Pitts, then it must afford the same deference to the decision of the California Supreme Court in\n5 Venegas that applies Eleventh Amendment immunity to Sheriffs in regard to their law enforcement\n6 duties.\n7 Defendants respectfully submit that because the Defendant Sheriffs is a state actor in this\n8 scope, they cannot be sued under ยง 1983 pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment. Accordingly,\n10 VII.\n9 Defendants respectfully request that their motion for summary adjudication be granted in this regard.\n11 THE COUNTY OF KERN is AN IMPROPER PARTY TO THIS ACTION\n12 As stated above, pursuant to ยง 1983, local government entities may only be held liable for\n13 constitutional injuries that are inflcted by their officials which are pursuant to municipal policy,\n14 practice or custome. Monell, supra, 436 U.S. at 654. As discussed in greater detail above, the\n15 Supreme Cour in McMilian reaffrmed that state governent actors cannot be liable under ยง 1983.\n16 Further, in accordance with Pitts, County oflos Angeles v. Superior Court (Peters), 68 Cal.App.4th\n17 (1998), and Venegas, the counties also sued in each case also were dismissed from each respective\n18 matter because the actions taken by the District Attorney or the Sheriff occurred on behalf of the\n19 State rather than the County, resulting in the individual Defendants not being subject to suit under\n20 ยง 1983 pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment. Because the conduct at issue in each of these cases\n21 occurred on behalf of the State in relation to dealing with crime, these courts concluded that no\n22 County involvement existed in the claim which the plaintiffs therein asserted.\n23 On this basis, the Kern County Sheriff in his official capacity, in addressing and fighting\n24 crime within the confines of the jail, acts on behalf of the State of Califomia. Therefore, in that\n25 capacity he did not act on behalf of the County of Kern. Thus, because he was acting for the State\nKern under Monell for any\n26 and not the County of  Kern, no liability can be imputed to the County of \n27 actions related to the strip search of detainees returning to the jail from the Kern County Superior\nKern\n28 Court for appearances related to the criminal charges against them.

RELIEF  REQUESTED. \nPlaintiffs,  former  prisoners  held  at  the  Kern  County  Jail  (โKCJโโ)  and  the putative \nclasses  they  represent,  bring  this  facial  challenge  to  certain  Kern  County  Sheriffโs \nDepartmentโs  (โโKCSDโ)  strip/visual  body  cavity  search policies  and practices.  Plaintiffs \ncontend  that  the  KCSDโs  former  policies  of  (1)  routinely  strip  searchingโ  prisoners \nordered  released  from custody  pursuant  to  court  order without  reasonable  suspicion  that \nthe prisoner posses  weapons or contraband,  and  (2)  routinely  searching all prisoners  upon \ntheir  arrival  at  the  Lerdo  jail  in  groups,  without  privacy  and  where  the  strip  search  was \nviewed by other inmates and jail personnel not necessary to the  search, violated plaintiffsโ \nrights  under  the  federal and  state  constitutions.  Thus,  plaintiffs  contend, they  are  entitled \nto  this  Courtโs  ruling  that  defendants  are  liable  as  a matter of law  for  violating  plaintiffsโ \nrights. \n13 \nI.  STATEMENT  OF  FACTS. \n14 \nA.  The  Kern  County  Jail. \n15      \nThe  KCSD  operates  the  Kern  County  Jail  (KCJ).  The  KCJ  consists  of  Central \n16 \nReceiving  Facility  (CRF)  in Bakersfield,  the  Lerdo  Detention  Complex  (Lerdo jail),  and \n17 \npre-arraignment jails  at  Mojave  and  Ridgecrest.  Most  new  arrestees  are  initially  housed \n18 \nat  CRF.  If  not  released  from  CRF,  arrestees  are  then  housed  at  the  Lerdo  jail.  (The \n19 \nMojave  and  Ridgecrest  jails  are  used  to  hold,  pre-arraignment,  those  arrestees  who, \n20 \n21  because  of geographical  distance,  must  be  held  in  custody  while  awaiting  transport  to \n22  CRF in  Bakersfield.) Plaintiffsโ Statement of Undisputed Facts  (hereinafter โPSUFโโ) nos. \n23  1-3. \n24  Arrestees  may  remain at  CRF  anywhere  from  a  few  hours  to  a  few  days.  Arrestees \n25  are  then  either  released  from  custody,  or  transported  to  Kern  County  Superior  Court \n26 \n  \n27 \n'  As  used herein  to  refer  to  defendantsโ  policies,  a  โstrip  searchโ means  strip/visual  body  cavity \nsearch. \n28 \n1 \nP LAINTIFFSโ  MEMORANDUM  OF LAW IN  SUPPORT  OF  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMEhoo.wep \nCase  1:07-cv-00474-DLB  Document  69 _  Filed  11/07/08  Page  7  of  20 \n(KCSC)  for  their  initial  court  appearance.  If,  following  the  arresteeโs  initial  court \nappearance,  the  KCSC orders  the  arresteeโs release,  the  arrestee is  returned to CRF  where \nhe  is  released  (assuming  no  other  holds).  If  KCSC  remands  the  arrestee  to  custody,  the \narrestee returns  to CRF,  then  via bus  transported to  the Lerdo jail  where he  is  housed until \neither  his  release  or  next  court  appearance.  PSUF  nos.  4-5. \nPost-arraignment  prisoners,  including  those  serving  sentences,  are  housed  at  the \nLerdo jail.  If  a  prisoner  housed  at  the  Lerdo  jail  has  a  court  appearance,  via  bus  KCSD \ntransports  the prisoner to CRF where he  is  staged forthe  court appearance.  Following that \nappearance  the  prisoner is  returned  to  CRF,  then  to  his  Lerdo jail  housing.  At  Lerdo,  the \n10 \nprisoner is  heldin  custody or released,  depending  onthe  courtโs  order(s).  Thus,  prisoners \n11 \nwho,  following  a  court  appearance,  are  ordered  released,  are  turned  to  the  Lerdo  jail  so \n12 \nthat  they  may  be  released  from  custody.

Strip/Visual  Body  Cavity  Search  โ  defined \n15      \nA  strip/visual  body  cavity  search  requires  the  arrestee  or  prisoner  to  remove  all \n16 \nclothing  so  as  to  permit  a visual  inspection  of the  breasts,  buttocks,  and  genitalia  of the \n17 \nperson  being  searched.  A  female  prisoner  must  expose  her  vagina;  a  male  prisoner must \n18 \nlift  his  penis  and  scrotum for  visual  inspection.  A  prisoner  must  bend  over  and  separate \n19 \nhis/her  buttocks  cheeks,  to  squat  down  then  stand  back  up,  and  to  cough  three  times. \n20 \n21  From  2003  to  present,  the  manner  of  strip  searching  prisoners  has  not  changed.  PSUF \nnos.  10-12. \n22 \n23  2.  Who  Gets  Strip/Visual  Body  Cavity  Searched \n24  Broadly  speaking,  prisoners  subjected  to  a  strip  search  fall into  one  of three  types: \n25  (1)  arrestees  strip  searched  pursuant  to  Cal.

Moreover, this  last  group includes \nprisoners  like  Marsial  Lopez  and  Theodore  Medina  โ  the  Kern  County  Superior  Court \nhad  ordered their  release  from custody  butin  the  course of processing  their  releases,  KCJ \nofficials  strip  searched  Mr.  Lopez  and  Mr.  Medina  because jail  officials  returned  to  the \nLerdo  jail  to  process  their  releases.

The  Absence  Of Privacy For Prisoners  Strip  Searched At  The  Lerdo  Jail \n10 \nUpon  Arrival \n11 \nBefore October 2007,  KCSD routinely conducted strip  searching in a group  setting, \n12 \nwithout  providing  prisoners  privacy.  There  were  no  partitions,  booths,  or  curtains. \n13 \nPrisoners  were  lined  up  in  a  group  as  many  as  25,  and  could  observe  each  otherโs \n14 \nsearches.  For  instance,  plaintiff  Sandra  Chavez  had  to  expose  her  vagina  while  on  her \n15      \nmenstrual  cycle,  in  full  view  of other  arrestees.  Women  were  ordered  to  remove  sanitary \n16 \nnapkins  in  view  of  other  prisoners.  Prisoners  were  crowded  together  so  tightly  that \n17 \nphysical  contact  was  unavoidable.  PSUF  nos.  13-15,  20. \n18 \nThis  practice  of  searching  prisoners  in  groups  without  privacy  stood  in  stark \n19 \ncontrast  to  the  jailโs  Cal.  Penal  Code  ยง  4030  searches.  For  those  strip  searches  KCJ \n20 \n21  personnel  strip  searched  ยง  4030(/  arrestees  individually,  in  a booth  that prevented other \nprisoners  and  non-involved jail  personnel  from  observing  the  search.

The  Strip  Searches  Were  Often  Conducted  Under  Unsanitary  And \nDegrading  Conditions \nDuring group  strip  searches, prisoners  were exposed to unsanitary conditions.  They \nstood  and  walked  barefoot  on  dirty  floors  contaminated  with  bodily  fluids,  including \nblood,  with  material tracked  on  shoes  from outside  and  from within  other locations  of the \nfacility.  Detainees  were  required  to  throw  their clothing  on  filthy  floors  and  at  times,  had \nto  re-dress  in  clothing  after  it  had  lain  on  the  dirty  floor.  PSUF  nos.  14,  15,  21. \nMenstruating  women  bled  on  themselves  and  on  the  floor.  The  floor  was  also  the \nrepository  for  the  prisonersโ  clothes.  Male  and  female  prisoners  stood  barefoot  on  the \nsame  floor that captured the prisonersโ  clothes  and bodily fluids.  Meanwhile, jail officials \nwould  also  offer  their  comments,  mocking  and/or  humiliating  prisoners,  including \ndisabled  prisoners  like  Mr.  Medina.

The  persons  subjected  to  the  search,  e.g.,  Mr.  Lopez  and  Mr.  Medina,  were  ordered \nreleased  from  custody.  At  the  point  the  release  order  issued,  defendantsโ  justification  for \n13 \nany  search  of  plaintiffs  was  necessarily  minimized.  And  when  one  considers  the \n14 \nespecially  intrusive  nature  of  a  strip/visual  body  cavity  search  (Way,  445  F.3d  at  1160) \n15      \nthe  policy  cannot be justified  under  the  Fourth  Amendment.

NCAA,  7  Cal.4th  1,  34  (1994).  In  Hill,  the  court  articulated  a  test  for  a  state \nconstitutional  right  to  privacy  cause  of  action.  There  must  be:  (1)  a  legally  protected \nprivacy  interest  involved;  (2)  a reasonable  expectation  of privacy  on  the  plaintiff's  part; \nand  (3)  a  serious  invasion  of  a  privacy  interest.  /d.  at  36-37.  The  plaintiff's  privacy \ninterest  must  then  be  balanced  against  the  defendantโs  countervailing  interest.  Jd.  The \ndefendant  must  demonstrate  either  a  โcompelling  interest,โ  /d.  at  34,  or  a  โlegitimate \ninterest,โ /d.  at 56-57, in violating plaintiffs privacy rights.  The  standard applied depends \nupon  the  nature  and  severity  of the  intrusion.  In  cases  where  the  defendant  commits  โan \nobvious  invasion  of  an  interest  fundamental  to  personal  autonomy,โ  .  .  .  a  โcompelling \n10 \ninterestโ  must be  present  to overcome  the  vital privacy  interest.  If,  in contrast,  the privacy \n11 \ninterest is  less  central,  or in  bona fide  dispute,  general  balancing tests  are  employed.โ  Jd. \n12 \nat  34.  If the  defendant  articulates  a  countervailing interest,  the  plaintiff has  the  burden  of \n13 \ndemonstrating  that  equally  effective  alternatives  that  are  less  intrusive  to  plaintiffโs \n14 \nprivacy  interests  are  available.  /d.  at  38.  If  such  alternatives  are  available,  the  invasion \n15      \nof privacy  is  enhanced.  /d.  The  โleast  intrusive  meansโ  is  applied  when  there  is  a  clear \n16 \ninvasion of  โcentral,  autonomy-based  rights,โ /d.  at  49,  or in  cases  where  a  state actor has \n17 \nviolated  a  right  of privacy. \n18 \nThe  Hill  court  made  clear that  alternatives  are  a key  factor  in  the  privacy  analysis, \n19 \nnoting  that,  โif  defendant's  legitimate  objectives  can  be  readily  accomplished  by \n20 \n21  alternative  means  having  little  or  no  impact  on  privacy  interests,  the  prospect  of \n22  actionable  invasion  of  privacy  is  enhanced.โ  /d.,  7  Cal.4th  at  38.

Given  the extreme  intrusion  on privacy,  defendants  cannot \n18 \nbegin  to  justify  the  practice  by  arguments  that  it  is  more  convenient  for  them,  and  they \n19 \ncannot contend that  it could  not  be  done, particularly  since defendants  have discontinued \n20 \n21  the  challenged policies.

Distinctions  in  statutes  that  involve  suspect  classifications  or \ntouch  upon  fundamental  interests  are  subject  to  strict  scrutiny,  and  can be  sustained  only \nif  they  are  necessary  to  achieve  a  compelling  state  interest.โ  People  v.

Where  a  statute \n10 \ntouches  on  a  fundamental  interest,  โit  must  be  narrowly  drawn  to  use  the  least  intrusive \n11 \nmeans  to  achieve a  compelling state  purpose.โ Del Monte v.

The  conclusion  that  these  highly \n18 \ndemeaning  and  embarrassing  searches  implicate  fundamental  interests  is  considerably \n19 \nstrengthened  in  California  by  Article  I,  Section  1  of the  California  Constitution  because \n20 \n21  of  its  explicit  elevation  of  privacy  protections  to  constitutional  dimensions.  See  Part \n22  ITICE)(1),  supra. \n23  Here,  plaintiffs  contend  they  were  denied  equal protection  because  KCJ  provided \n24  privacy  to  prisoners  strip  searched  pursuant  to  Cal.

PSUF  nos.  13,  16.  This  unequal \ntreatment  of similarly  situated  prisoners  (both groups  subjected  to  strip  searches), places \nthe  burden  on  defendants  to  justify  this  disparate  treatment.  In  Long  Beach  City \nEmployees Assn,  41  Cal.3d  937  (1986),  the  issue  was  whether  a  statutory  scheme  which \nforbad  private  employers  from requiring  employees  to  take  a polygraph  examination  as \na  condition  of employment,  while  permitting  some  public  employers  to  use  polygraph \nexaminations,  violated  the  equal  protection  rights  of  the  employees  who  could  be \nsubjected  to  polygraph  examinations.  The  California  Supreme  Court,  in  ruling  that  the \nlie  detector tests  implicated privacy interests  protected by Article  I,  ยง  1,  held  that  the  โthe \nburden  is  on  the  City  to demonstrate  that the  classifications drawn  by Labor Code  section \n432.2  and  Government  Code  section  3307  are  justified  by  a  compelling  governmental \ninterest  and  that  the  distinctions  drawn  are  necessary to  further that purpose.โ  41  Cal.3d \n13 \nat  948  (emphasis  added).  The  โstate  must  establish  the  unavailability  of  less  offensive \n14 \nalternatives  and  demonstrate that  the  statutory  intrusion  on the  cherished  right of privacy \n15      \nis  drawn  with  narrow  specificity.โ  41  Cal.3d  at  953. \n16 \nDefendants  cannot offer  any  compelling  justification  for providing  privacy  to  one \n17 \ngroup  of prisoners  strip  searched  (ยง  4030(4/)  arrestees),  but  not to  prisoners  strip  searched \n18 \nupon  their  arrival  at  the  Lerdo jail.  An  argument  of  administrative  convenience,  i.e.,  it \n19 \nwas  easier and/or  less  costly  to  provide  privacy to  the  ยง  4030(f)  prisoners  than  those like \n20 \n21  plaintiffs,  fails.  โIt  is  now  well  settled  that  administrative  burden  does  not  constitute  a \ncompelling  state  interest  which  would justify  the  infringement  of  a  fundamental  right.โ \n22 \n23  Central  Valley  Chap.  7th  Step  Foundation  v.

This Court has jurisdiction over this Lawsuit and each of the parties to \n24\nit. \n25\n26\n27\n            4               \n28\n \n \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 151    Filed 08/31/11   Page 6 of 23\n   \n1 II.  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT APPROVED BECAUSE FAIR, \nADEQUATE AND REASONABLE \n2\n3.  The settlement of this lawsuit was not the product of collusion \n3\nbetween Plaintiffs and Defendants or their respective counsel, but rather was the \n4\nresult of armโs-length negotiations conducted in good faith by the parties and their \n5\ncounsel, with the assistance of an independent mediator. \n6\n4.  The Classโs satisfaction with the settlement is reflected in the claim \n7\nstatistics. There were 36,075 total identified class members in the Countyโs \n8\ndatabase, 29,678 of whom had a mailing address.  After re-mailing returned \n9\nmailings, the Class Administrator was able to mail successfully to 22,917 such \n10\nmembers. There were 7,961 timely Claim Forms filed, which is over 34% of class \n11\nmembers reached through the mail. (See Solรณrzano Decl., ยถยถ3-10.) If the total \n12\n36,075 class members are counted, this is a claim rate of 22%. According to \n13\nPlaintiffsโ counsel, who have handled several of these cases, this is on the high end \n14\nof claim rates. (See Declaration of Barrett S. Litt, ยถ5.) There were only two \n15\nobjections (addressed in Section VII, infra) and 15 opt-outs (addressed in Section \n16\nVI, infra) , which means that, even if opt-outs are considered individuals \n17\ndissatisfied in some form with the result (a conclusion not borne out by the content \n18\nof the opt-outs), less than 1/20 of 1% of class members expressed any type of \n19\narguable dissatisfaction. Litt Decl., ยถ6.  This is a highly favorable reaction by the \n20\nclass to the settlement. See, e.g., Hughes v. Microsoft Corp., 2001 WL 34089697, 8 \n21\n(W.D.Wash. 2001) (court found that the โclass members overwhelmingly \n22\nsupport[ed] the settlementโ where there were over 37,000 notices sent out, 2,745 \n23\nclass members participated in the settlement, โonly nine objections were \n24\nsubmittedโ, and there were 86 timely opt-outs and over 20 additional defective or \n25\nuntimely opt-outs;  โthese indicia of the approval of the class of the terms of the \n26\n27\n            5               \n28\n \n \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 151    Filed 08/31/11   Page 7 of 23\n   \n1 settlement support a finding of fairness under Rule 23โ), citing Hanlon v. Chrysler \n2 Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1027 (9th Cir.1998) (despite vigorous objections and appeal \n3 by objectors, โfact that the overwhelming majority of the class willingly approved \n4 the offer and stayed in the class presents at least some objective positive \n5 commentary as to its fairnessโ; court did not abuse its discretion in approving \n6 settlement). \n7 5.  The Settlement Agreement and the settlement set forth therein โ \n8 attached to the Preliminary Approval Order in this case โ are hereby approved and \n9 found to be fair, adequate, reasonable, in the best interest of the Class as a whole, \n10 and in satisfaction of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and due \n11 process requirements. \n12 III.  CERTIFICATION OF STRIP SEARCH CLASSES \n13 6.  The Court has previously certified Strip Search Classes under Fed. R. \n14 Civ. P. 23(b)(3) for damages and monetary relief.  Class Members have a right to \n15 opt out of the settlement.  The Court hereby reaffirms the class definitions as set \n16 forth in the Class Certification Order of April 1, 2009, and reiterated in the \n17 Settlement Agreement, including the class period of March 27, 2005, to October 1, \n18 2007. \n19 7.  The Court reaffirms that all the criteria of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and \n20 (b)(3) are met for all the classes settled herein.  Specifically, the Court finds that all \n21 the criteria of Rule 23(a) are met, to wit, 1) that the class is so numerous that \n22 joinder of all members individually is impracticable, 2) that there are questions of \n23 law or fact common to the class, 3) that Plaintiffsโ claims are typical of the claims \n24 of Class Members, and 4) that the persons representing the class must be able fairly \n25 and adequately to protect the interests of all members of the class. The Court \n26 further finds, pursuant to the provisions of Rule 23(b)(3) that 1) the common \n27\n            6               \n28\n \n \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 151    Filed 08/31/11   Page 8 of 23\n   \n1 factual and legal issues predominate over any such issues that affect only \n2 individual Class Members, and 2) that a class action is superior to other available \n3 methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy. The Court \n4 further concludes that nothing in the partiesโ settlement alters, but rather, if \n5 anything, reinforces, the prior conclusions it reached regarding the desirability of \n6 the class action mechanism as a means of resolving the claims in this case. \n7 IV.  NOTICE \n8 8.  As required by this Court in its Preliminary Approval Order: (a) Class \n9 and Settlement Notice, and Claim Forms, were mailed by first-class mail to all \n10 Class Members for whom addresses could be determined, and to all potential Class \n11 Members who requested a copy; and (b) Class and Settlement Notice was \n12 published as set forth in the Settlement Agreement and in the Preliminary \n13 Approval Order, all as more fully set forth in the Declaration of Tricia M. \n14 Solorzano.  \n15 9.  The notice given to the class is hereby determined to be fully in \n16 compliance with requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \n17 and due process, and is found to be the best notice practicable under the \n18 circumstances and to constitute due and sufficient notice to all parties entitled \n19 thereto. \n20 10.  Due and adequate notice of the proceedings having been given to the \n21 Class and a full opportunity having been offered to the Class to participate in the \n22 hearing, it is hereby determined that all Class Members, except those who have \n23 opted out of the settlement, listed in the Declaration of Julia C. White, are bound \n24 by this Final Order of Approval and Settlement. \n25 V.  CLAIMS FILED \n26 11.  The claims filing postmark deadline was on July 13, 2011.  As of \n27\n            7               \n28\n \n \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 151    Filed 08/31/11   Page 9 of 23\n   \n1 August 12, 2011, the Class Administrator has received 7,961 timely Claim Forms \n2 and 111 late Claim Forms. Solorzano Decl., ยถ10.  Of the 111 late Claim Forms, 21 \n3 were Post-Release Class members. \n4 12.  The Court will allow the valid late claims to be considered and paid if \n5 received by the Claims Administrator by August 26, 2011. \n6 VI.  OPT-OUTS \n7 13.  There were 14 unequivocal opt-outs. Solorzano Decl., ยถ11.  This \n8 figure does not include 1 individual who subsequently retracted [his/her] opt-out. \n9 14.  As class members have opted out, Plaintiffsโ counsel have attempted \n10 to contact opt-outs to see if they had any questions that could be cleared up. \n11 Declaration of Julia C.  White, ยถ2.  Counsel was able to find contact information \n12 for 12 of the individuals. White Decl., ยถยถ2(a), (c), (d), (e).  Based on these contacts, \n13 Plaintiffsโ counsel have been able to determine the nature of most if not all of the \n14 reasons the opt-outs were filed. \n15 15.  Six individuals indicated that they believed they were never strip \n16 searched. White Decl., ยถ2(d).  One additional individual indicated he was never \n17 incarcerated in Kern County Jail. White Decl., ยถ2(e).  As such, these people should \n18 not be considered opt-outs even if they filed an opt-out request, as they do not \n19 qualify as class members at all because a condition of membership in each class is \n20 that the person was strip searched by Kern County. \n21 VII.  OBJECTIONS \n22 16.  There have been two objections to the settlement in this matter.  \n23 17.  The first objection, by Gregory McClellan, was dated March 24, 2011, \n24 prior to the deadline for filing objections.  A copy of Mr. McClellanโs objection \n25 was previously filed with the Court on July 13, 2011.  Mr. McClellan also filed a \n26 claim form.  According to Mr. McClellan, he was strip searched on three occasions \n27\n            8               \n28\n \n \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 151    Filed 08/31/11   Page 10 of 23\n   \n1 (twice on 11-09-2006, and once on 11-16-2006).  He objects to the settlement \n2 amount due him, which he indicates is $200, and instead is seeking $1,500.00. He \n3 cites no case law and gives no particular factual reason why he is entitled to \n4 $1,500, as opposed to the amount he is due to receive as a result of this settlement. \n5 18.  The second objection, by Sean Robbins, was dated June 8, 2011, prior \n6 to the deadline for filing objections.  A copy of Mr. Robbinsโ objection was \n7 previously filed with the Court on July 13, 2011.   He also filed a claim form, and \n8 he is due $200 under the settlement. According to Mr. Robbins, he was strip \n9 searched on multiple occasions during the booking process, during inmate transfers \n10 and on return from court.  Mr. Robbins also claims that he was strip searched by \n11 female officers. He objects to the settlement amount due him, but does not provide \n12 an amount to which he believes he is due. \n13 19.  The settlement of this lawsuit was not the product of collusion \n14 between Plaintiffs and Defendants or their respective counsel. Rather, it was the \n15 result of bona fide and armโs-length negotiations conducted in good faith by the \n16 parties and their counsel with the assistance of an independent mediator, who is a \n17 retired United States District Judge. \n18 Plaintiffsโ counselsโ efforts prior to settlement were extensive, and involved \n19 all that occurs in a case that is litigated up to the eve of trial. The work performed \n20 included: 1) extensive investigation of the underlying circumstances, including \n21 speaking with scores of class members; 2) discovery including three sets of \n22 requests for production of documents, interrogatories and multiple depositions; 4) \n23 multiple summary judgment motions by both sides, on all of which Plaintiffs \n24 prevailed; 5) a successful contested motion to certify the classes; 6) retention of \n25 data consultants and extensive analysis of computerized jail data; 7) contested \n26 motions to certify an interlocutory appeal; and 8) attendance and work associated \n27\n            9               \n28\n \n \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 151    Filed 08/31/11   Page 11 of 23\n   \n1 with four day-long mediation sessions. \n2 Any settlement requires compromise by both parties and involves the \n3 weighing of several considerations.  One significant factor in settlement is to take \n4 into account the risks associated with proceeding through to trial.  The issues \n5 involved are complex areas of constitutional law in an arena where considerable \n6 deference is given to jail officials. The settlement in this case encompassed two \n7 categories of class members. At the time this lawsuit was filed, the law was not \n8 settled in either of the areas encompassed by the suit.  For the Group Strip Search \n9 class, there is very little law stating that a strip search in a group setting is in and of \n10 itself a constitutional violation.  For the Post-Release class, in the course of the \n11 lawsuit, there were developments that can fairly be stated as problematic for \n12 Plaintiffs.  Those cases, namely Bull v. City & County of San Francisco, 595 F.3d \n13 964, 966 (9th Cir. 2010); Powell v. Barrett, 541 F.3d 1298 (11th Cir.2008); and \n14 Florence v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders of County of Burlington, 621 F.3d 296 (3d \n15 Cir. 9/21/2010), cert. granted, 2011 WL 202772 (4/4/2011), all demonstrated \n16 substantial risk and uncertainty for Plaintiffs in what is now unsettled legal terrain.  \n17 Further, the authority upon which Plaintiffs were able to rely was relatively scant, \n18 and emanated from the body of law whose validity is at least called into question \n19 by Bull, Powell and Florence. \n20 The financial terms of the settlement are very favorable to class members. \n21 Post-release class members receive $1500 for a first time and $750 for a second \n22 offense. This is considerably higher than the average recovery in many other strip \n23 search class actions. While this is partly explained by the scale of the other cases \n24 compared to this one, the fact remains that class members are receiving very \n25 favorable payments. In addition, those for whom searches would have otherwise \n26 been legal under Plaintiffsโ theories had they been conducted in privacy (i.e., those \n27\n            10               \n28\n \n \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 151    Filed 08/31/11   Page 12 of 23\n   \n1 strip searched in groups), are receiving money, including Messrs. McClellan and \n2 Robbins. \n3 The reason for the difference in values for the two groups - $1500 for post-\n4 release versus $200 for group strip search โ  is primarily that the very act of strip \n5 searching post-release is (Plaintiffs contended) illegal. In contrast, Plaintiffs did \n6 not contend that the act of strip searching those searched in groups was illegal, \n7 only the manner of the search. Since most jails provide a variety of settings in \n8 which inmates are nude in front of each other and in front of guards, the damages \n9 for group searches are relatively minimal compared to damages for one illegally \n10 strip searched. \n11 The results in this case cannot be judged solely by the monetary component \n12 of the settlement. The County ceased all strip search practices addressed in this \n13 settlement. That is a major accomplishment, particularly in light of the standing \n14 limitations imposed on such cases. Tens of thousands of future inmates have been \n15 spared the โembarrassing and humiliating experienceโ, and โextensive intrusion on \n16 personal privacyโ, that a strip search, โregardless of how professionally and \n17 courteously conductedโ, necessarily entails. In some cases, they will not be strip \n18 searched at all (post-release inmates) and in others, if they are strip searched, it will \n19 be done with much greater privacy. \n20 Unlike most class actions, Plaintiffs and the classes they represent were \n21 persons charged with crimes and, thus, not people generally considered \n22 sympathetic or desirable by the public at large.  This makes any potential jury \n23 verdict speculative at best. \n24 With regard to Mr. Robbinsโ objection that he was strip searched by female \n25 guards, this was not a claim raised in the lawsuit. More importantly, the Ninth \n26 Circuit has held that visual body strip searches of male inmates by female guards \n27\n            11               \n28\n \n \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 151    Filed 08/31/11   Page 13 of 23\n   \n1 are not per se unlawful. See Grummett v. Rushen, 779 F.2d 491, 495-96 (9th \n2 Cir.1985) (pat-down searches of male inmates that included groin area by female \n3 guards do not violate Fourth Amendment); Michenfelder v. Sumner, 860 F.2d 328, \n4 332, 334 (9th Cir.1988) (occasional visual strip searches of male inmates by \n5 female guards do not violate Fourth Amendment; โ[o]ur circuit's law respects an \n6 incarcerated prisoner's right to bodily privacy, but has found that assigned \n7 positions of female guards that require only infrequent and casual observation, or \n8 observation at distance, and that are reasonably related to prison needs are not so \n9 degrading as to warrant court interferenceโ ); Jordan v. Gardner, 986 F.2d 1521, \n10 1524-26 (9th Cir. 1993) (policy that male guards would routinely engage in \n11 โclothed body searchesโ of women inmates, which entailed a search up to several \n12 minutes, running the guardโs hands over the female inmateโs clothed body from the \n13 neck to the feet, โpush[ing] inward and upward when searching the crotch and \n14 upper thighsโ, and flattening the breast, violated the Eighth Amendment; the record \n15 established that that โwomen experience unwanted intimate touching by men \n16 differently from men subject to comparable touching by womenโ, and that many of \n17 the women inmates at WCCW suffered had โhistories of sexual or physical abuse \n18 by menโ). Had Mr. Robbins wished to pursue such a claim for himself, he had that \n19 right, but it is not a valid objection to this settlement. \n20 20.  Based on the foregoing, the Court overrules the objections by Gregory \n21 McClellan and Sean Robbins. \n22 VIII. ALLOCATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF SETTLEMENT FUND \n23 21.  The Court hereby approves the Settlement Agreement. The Court \n24 finds that Defendantsโ proposed payment of the following amounts (each of which \n25 is in addition to the other) are within the range of what would constitute a fair, \n26 reasonable, and adequate settlement in the best interests of the class as a whole: \n27\n            12               \n28\n \n \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 151    Filed 08/31/11   Page 14 of 23\n   \n1 (a)  A person who was subjected for the first time during the class \n2 period (between March 27, 2005, and October 1, 2007) to a \n3 Kern County strip search after a Court ordered him or her to be \n4 released from all pending charges, and the person was in fact \n5 entitled to immediate release based on that order, will receive a \n6 payment of $1500 (subject to certain possible adjustments \ndescribed below in ยถ2(d)). \n7\n(b)  A person who was subjected for a second time during the class \n8\nperiod (between March 27, 2005, and October 1, 2007) to a \n9\nKern County strip search after a Court ordered him or her to be \n10\nreleased from all pending charges, and the person was in fact \n11\nentitled to immediate release based on that order, will receive a \n12\npayment of $750 in addition to the $1500 for the first strip \n13\nsearch (again subject to certain possible adjustments described \n14\nbelow in ยถ2(d)). No additional payments will be made to \n15\npersons subjected to more than two such searches. \n16\n(c)  A person who was strip searched in a group while in Kern \n17\nCounty custody will receive a one time only payment \n18\n(regardless of the number of times the person was strip searched \n19\nin a group) of $200 (subject to certain possible adjustments \n20\ndescribed below in ยถ2(d)). \n21\n(d)  Notwithstanding the amounts set forth above to be paid to each \n22\nclass member, the parties have agreed to a maximum payout for \n23\neach class, the amount of which was derived from their joint \n24\nestimate that claims are unlikely to exceed approximately 28% \n25\nof the class members (and, based on past experience, will likely \n26\nbe meaningfully lower than that). Accordingly, the amounts to \n27\n            13               \n28\n \n \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 151    Filed 08/31/11   Page 15 of 23\n   \n1 be paid Class Members (not including class representatives) \n2 will be adjusted if the amount to be awarded eligible Class \n3 Members in either the Post-Release or Group Strip Search who \n4 make claims exceeds the total amount to be paid to that Class. \n5 In that event, the amount that members of that class receive will \n6 be adjusted on a pro-rated basis, which would result in payment \nto individual Class Members of amounts lower than those set \n7\nforth above. The total amount paid to Post-Release Class \n8\nMembers is capped at $2,335,830.00, and if claims exceed that, \n9\nthey will be adjusted on a pro-rated basis so that the total \n10\npayment to such Post-Release Class Members (first and second \n11\ntime combined) will not exceed that total. The amount paid to \n12\nGroup Strip Search Class Members is capped at $2,016,000.00, \n13\nand if claims exceed that, they will be adjusted on a pro-rated \n14\nbasis so that the total payment to such Group Strip Search Class \n15\nMembers will not exceed that total. \n16\n(e)  Class administration costs, as described below at Section X. \n17\n(f)  $2,000,000 in attorneysโ fees, plus class counsel costs not to \n18\nexceed $65,000. \n19\n(g)  $30,000 damages award to each Named Plaintiff, of whom \n20\nthere are three, as identified below at Section IX. \n21\n22.  The Administrator shall make payments to SCMs who have filed \n22\ntimely claims in accordance with this Final Approval Order within a reasonable \n23\ntime, with a goal of within 120 days after the Effective Date. If a check to a SCM \n24\nis not cashed within three months of its mailing, the Administrator shall hold the \n25\nfunds for six additional months, during which time it shall make reasonable efforts \n26\nto contact the person to whom the un-cashed check was written to make \n27\n            14               \n28\n \n \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 151    Filed 08/31/11   Page 16 of 23\n   \n1 arrangements for its cashing or reissuance. Any such funds not cashed within one \n2 year of its mailing shall revert to Defendants. \n3 IX.  NAMED PLAINTIFFSโ DISTRIBUTION \n4 23.  The class representatives are Marsial Lopez, Sandra Chavez, and \n5 Theodore Medina.  The Court awards each of the Named Plaintiffs $30,000.  The \n6 Named Plaintiffs will not otherwise participate in the claims process involving \n7 SCMโs, or receive any other payment under the terms of the Settlement \n8 Agreement. \n9 24.  The Court concludes that this award is justified because the Named \n10 Plaintiffs made contributions to the class as a whole, justifying awards to them \n11 higher than those to the general class. In addition, the Named Plaintiffsโ \n12 individualized damages claims, including special damages, are a factor in the \n13 determination of the sum they receive. Such determinations cannot reasonably be \n14 made for class members in general without unduly consuming funds for \n15 administrative costs that will otherwise be available for distribution to Class \n16 members. Any fees due Class Counsel for their representation of the Named \n17 Plaintiffs are encompassed within the Class Fund Attorneysโ Fees referenced \n18 herein. \n19 X.  CLASS ADMINISTRATION \n20 25.  The Court reaffirms the retention of Gilardi & Co., LLC (โGilardiโ) as \n21 Class Administrator to administer the distribution of the Class and Settlement \n22 Notice. The Court authorizes the payment, to be made immediately by the \n23 Defendants to cover Gilardiโs expenses to date.  The Court also authorizes payment \n24 of Gilardiโs further expenses by the Defendants related to class administration, \n25 distribution of settlement checks to Class Members, and handling of payments to \n26 Claimants with Liens as set forth in the Settlement Agreement. \n27\n            15               \n28\n \n \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 151    Filed 08/31/11   Page 17 of 23\n   \n1 26.  As part of the overall costs of Class Administration, the Court \n2 authorizes payment by Defendants of any expenses for a Special Master as set \n3 forth in the Settlement Agreement, should retention of a Special Master become \n4 necessary.  No further order of this Court is required to pay Class Administration \n5 costs.  Such payment shall be separate from the payment of Named Plaintiffs, \n6 attorneysโ fees and costs, and payments to class members. \n7 XI.  LIEN PROVISIONS \n8 27.  Consistent with the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the Class \n9 Administrator shall deduct from any claim certain payment amounts owed by a \n10 Claimant with Liens for any liens or court orders for restitution, child support, \n11 debts to county and statutory liens. The Class Administrator will make payment to \n12 Kern County, the proper payee and/or their designee for those payment amounts \n13 deducted as set forth in this paragraph. The Defendants shall prepare a list of the \n14 liens or orders applicable to each Claimant with Liens. That list will be provided to \n15 the Administrator, which will be responsible to confirm the list of such liens.  The \n16 following procedures shall apply to the liens. \n17 a.  For Claimants with Liens, the payment disbursement letter \n18 accompanying any claim check sent to them shall include a \n19 notice of that amount, specifying the nature of the lien and the \n20 purported amount of the lien. The Notice shall include advising \n21 the claimant of his or her right to contest the lien and advise \n22 him or her of the procedures to do so. The Notice will advise \n23 the Claimant with Liens that they have 30 days from the date of \n24 receipt of such notice (based on the postmark of said notice) to \n25 file a Notice Contesting Lien, and of the procedure to contest \n26 the lien. A form Notice Contesting Lien shall be provided to \n27\n            16               \n28\n \n \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 151    Filed 08/31/11   Page 18 of 23\n   \n1 each Claimant with Liens, to be prepared by the Administrator \n2 subject to approval by the parties, which will be used to contest \n3 the lien.  The Notice Contesting Lien shall specify the grounds \n4 for the objection, and copies shall be sent to Class Counsel, \n5 Defendantsโ counsel and the Claims Administrator. \n6 b.  First, the SCM, Class Counsel and Defendantsโ Counsel will \n7 attempt to resolve the objection by meet and confer conference.  \n8 In the event the objection cannot be resolved in that fashion, the \n9 Special Master agreed to pursuant to ยถ49 of the Settlement \n10 Agreement will be empowered to resolve any lien disputes \n11 under this paragraph. To participate as a class member, any \n12 Claimant with Liens will be deemed to have agreed that the \n13 Special Masterโs determination shall be binding and non-\n14 appealable, and that fact shall be included in the letter sent to \n15 Claimants with Liens. Such a claimant may present his or her \n16 contentions and supporting documents in writing to the Special \n17 Master. The Special Master will decide the validity of the lien, \n18 and may request recommendations from each sideโs counsel \n19 before doing so. \n20 c.  Despite the amount of any lien, no Claimant with Liens shall \n21 have to pay more than 50% of his/her class fund payment \n22 towards the lien, which ensures that the claimant will receive \n23 funds for his/her claim regardless of the amount of any lien.  \n24 d.  The cost of the Special Master shall be borne by the Defendants \n25 as part of the Class Administration costs. \n26 28.  The Court approves the use of the liens under the terms set forth \n27\n            17               \n28\n \n \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 151    Filed 08/31/11   Page 19 of 23\n   \n1 above, which will reduce the portion of the settlement provided to any SCM to \n2 whom these provisions apply. Any government recordation of such liens or debts \n3 shall be adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect the reduction resulting from the \n4 pay down of the liens or debts effectuated by this provision. \n5 XII.  SPECIAL MASTER \n6 29.  The Court reaffirms the appointment of retired United States District \n7 Judge Raul A. Ramirez as the Special Master in this case. \n8 XIII. CLASS COUNSEL \n9 30.  The Court reaffirms the appointment of Barrett S. Litt and Paul J. \n10 Estuar of Litt, Estuar & Kitson, LLP, as Class Counsel. \n11 XIV. CLASS FUND ATTORNEYSโ FEES \n12 31.  As set forth in the Settlement Agreement, Defendants shall pay a one-\n13 time only lump sump payment of $2,000,000 + costs (Two Million Dollars + \n14 actual costs) issued to Litt, Estuar & Kitson, LLP, which payment is inclusive of \n15 fees and costs.  This payment represents a full and final settlement of all past, \n16 present and future attorneysโ fees and all past, present and future ordinary and \n17 extraordinary costs.  It shall be paid as specified in ยถ34, infra. \n18 32.  The Court has reviewed the Plaintiffsโ counselโs claim for attorneysโ \n19 fees and finds them well within the accepted range for class fund fees. \n20 33.  The Court finds the partiesโ agreement regarding attorneysโ fees and \n21 costs to be reasonable, and awards the requested fees and costs. It addresses the \n22 issue in a separate order approving the fees and cost request herein. \n23  \n24\n25\n26\n27\n            18               \n28\n \n \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 151    Filed 08/31/11   Page 20 of 23\n   \n1 XV.  FORM OF PAYMENT OF NAMED PLAINTIFFSโ DISTRIBUTION \nAND ATTORNEYSโ FEES \n2\n34.  Within 30 days after the Effective Date, Defendants or their insurers \n3\nwill issue a check that will include the approved attorneysโ fees and costs and the \n4\nfunds awarded to the class representatives in a single check.  Alternatively \n5\nDefendants or their insurers may make a single wire transfer to the Litt, Estuar & \n6\nKitson, LLP Client Trust Account that will include the approved attorneysโ fees \n7\nand costs, and the funds awarded to the class representatives in a single transfer \n8\n(hereafter the โClass Rep/Fee Transferโ) within thirty (30) days of the Effective \n9\nDate. \n10\nXVI. GENERAL PROVISIONS \n11\n35.  Claim forms not received by August 26, 2011, shall not be paid, \n12\nalthough such persons shall nonetheless be bound by this Order. \n13\n36.  All class members except those who timely filed opt-outs shall be \n14\nbound by this Order. \n15\n37.  Except as otherwise provided in this Order, each party shall bear its \n16\nown costs, expenses and attorneysโ fees. \n17\n38.  The use of the masculine gender herein is construed to include the \n18\nfeminine and/or the neuter where applicable. The use of the singular herein is to be \n19\nconstrued to include the plural where applicable. The use of the plural herein shall \n20\nbe construed to include the singular where applicable. \n21\n39.  Any disputes regarding the right of a claimant or class member to \n22\nqualify for payment under Order shall be resolved by the Special Master. \n23\n40.  The Court reserves and maintains jurisdiction over this settlement and \n24\nits provisions, and over the claims administration and distribution of the funds. \n25\nDisagreements between the parties on any disputes or unresolved aspects of this \n26\n27\n            19               \n28\n \n \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 151    Filed 08/31/11   Page 21 of 23\n   \n1 Order shall be subject to mediation before the mediator who has mediated this case \n2 to date. If mediation is not successful, the matter shall be brought to this Court for \n3 resolution. \n4 41.  At the conclusion of the Class Distribution, the Class Administrator \n5 shall submit a report to the Court summarizing the payments made to the Class, \n6 and seeking any final administrative costs to be approved. \n7 XVII.   FINAL RESOLUTION \n8 42.  The monetary relief provided for in the Settlement Agreement shall \n9 compensate for all alleged violations of rights and all claims by the Plaintiff class \n10 members that were or could have been brought in this civil action under any theory \n11 of liability related to allegedly unlawful strip searches of those within the class \n12 definitions contained herein, except as to monetary damages for those class \n13 members who choose to opt out.   \n14 43.  The Court hereby dismisses the lawsuit on the merits, with prejudice, \n15 and without further costs, with such dismissal subject only to compliance by the \n16 Parties with the terms and conditions of the Settlement Agreement and this Final \n17 Order of Approval and Settlement. \n18 44.  Plaintiffs, including their agents, attorneys and assigns, are hereby \n19 severally and permanently barred and enjoined, to the fullest extent permitted by \n20 law, from filing, commencing, instituting, maintaining, prosecuting or participating \n21 in a lawsuit or any other proceeding against the Defendants, including the \n22 employees, entities, agents, attorneys and insurers of Defendants, involving or \n23 based on any of the claims encompassed by this Settlement and Order, including \n24 specifically claims on behalf of any class member whose claims are covered by \n25 this Settlement and Order.  \n26 45.  The Named Plaintiffs and each Class Member waive all rights or \n27\n            20               \n28\n \n \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 151    Filed 08/31/11   Page 22 of 23\n   \n1 benefits which he or she now has or in the future may have under the terms of \n2 California Civil Code ยง1542, arising from, alleged in, or pertaining to the claims \n3 that were asserted in the Lawsuit, specifically claims for strip searches and/or \n4 visual body cavity searches. Section 1542 reads: \n5 โA general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not \n6 know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the \n7 release, which if known by him or  her must have materially affected his or \n8 her settlement with the debtor.โ \n9 46.  Plaintiffs have not relied upon the advice of Class Counsel as to the \n10 legal and/or tax consequences of this settlement, the payment of any money by the \n11 Defendants or the distribution of the Settlement Funds.  \n12 47.  Neither this Final Order of Approval and Settlement, the Settlement \n13 Agreement, nor any of its terms or the negotiations or papers related thereto shall \n14 constitute evidence or an admission by any Defendant that any acts of wrongdoing \n15 have been committed, and they shall not be deemed to create any inference that \n16 there is any liability therefore. Neither this Final Order of Approval and \n17 Settlement, nor the Settlement Agreement, nor any of its terms or the negotiations \n18 or papers related thereto shall be offered or received in evidence or used for any \n19 purpose whatsoever, in this or any other matter or proceeding in any court, \n20 administrative agency, arbitration, or other tribunal, other than as expressly set \n21 forth in the Settlement Agreement. \n22 /// \n23 /// \n24 /// \n25 /// \n26 /// \n27\n            21               \n28\n \n \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 151    Filed 08/31/11   Page 23 of 23\n   \n1 48.  Pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the \n2 Court finds that there is no just reason for delay and therefore directs entry of this \n3 Final Order of Approval and Settlement. Inasmuch as this disposes of all claims \n4 asserted in the Lawsuit, the Court further directs the Clerk to enter an order of \n5 dismissal pursuant to F.R.Civ.P Rule 41(a)(1)(2). \n6  \n7 Dennis L.

PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT \n8 \n1.  This Order incorporates by reference the definitions in the Settlement \n9 \nAgreement (Exhibit A), and also incorporates Exhibits B through D, thereto. All \n10 \nterms defined therein shall have the same meaning in this Order. The Court has \n11 \njurisdiction over this settlement pursuant to the Order of Conditional Dismissal \n12 \nfrom the Ninth Circuit attached as Exhibit E.  \n13 \n2.  The Settlement Agreement is hereby preliminarily approved, subject \n14 \nto further consideration thereof, and final approval, at or after the Fairness Hearing \n15 \nprovided for below. The Court finds that Defendantsโ proposed payment of the \n16 \nfollowing amounts (each of which is in addition to the other) are within the range \n17 \nof what would constitute a fair, reasonable, and adequate settlement in the best \n18 \ninterests of the Class as a whole: \n19 \n(a) A person who was subjected for the first time during the class period \n20 \n(between March 27, 2005, and October 1, 2007) to a Kern County \n21 \nstrip search after a Court ordered him or her to be released from all \n22 \npending charges, and the person was in fact entitled to immediate \n23 \nrelease based on that order, will receive a payment of $1500 (subject \n24 \nto certain possible adjustments described below in ยถ 2(d)). \n25 \n(b) A person who was subjected for a second time during the class period \n26 \n(between March 27, 2005, and October 1, 2007) to a Kern County \n27 \n \n{00868293.DOC}\n2\n               \n28 \n \nAMENDED PRELIMINARY APPROVAL ORDER \n29   \n \n30 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 130    Filed 02/23/11   Page 3 of 12\n   \n1  strip search after a Court ordered him or her to be released from all \n2  pending charges, and the person was in fact entitled to immediate \n3  release based on that order, will receive a payment of $750 in addition \n4  to the $1500 for the first strip search (again subject to certain possible \n5  adjustments described below in ยถ 2(d)). No additional payments will \n6  be made to persons subjected to more than two such searches. \n(c) A person who was strip searched in a group while in Kern County \n7 \ncustody will receive a one time only payment (regardless of the \n8 \nnumber of times the person was strip searched in a group) of $200 \n9 \n(subject to certain possible adjustments described below in ยถ 2(d)). \n10 \n(d) Notwithstanding the amounts set forth above to be paid to each class \n11 \nmember, the parties have agreed to a maximum payout for each class, \n12 \nthe amount of which was derived from their joint estimate that claims \n13 \nare unlikely to exceed approximately 28% of the class members (and, \n14 \nbased on past experience, will likely be meaningfully lower than that). \n15 \nAccordingly, the amounts to be paid Class Members (not including \n16 \nclass representatives) will be adjusted if the amount to be awarded \n17 \neligible Class Members in either the Post-Release or Group Strip \n18 \nSearch who make claims exceeds the total amount to be paid to that \n19 \nClass. In that event, the amount that members of that class receive \n20 \nwill be adjusted on a pro-rated basis, which would result in payment \n21 \nto individual Class Members of amounts lower than those set forth \n22 \nabove. The total amount paid to Post-Release Class Members is \n23 \ncapped at $2,335,830.00, and if claims exceed that, they will be \n24 \nadjusted on a pro-rated basis so that the total payment to such Post-\n25 \nRelease Class Members (first and second time combined) will not \n26 \nexceed that total. The amount paid to Group Strip Search Class \n27 \n \n{00868293.DOC}\n3\n               \n28 \n \nAMENDED PRELIMINARY APPROVAL ORDER \n29   \n \n30 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 130    Filed 02/23/11   Page 4 of 12\n   \n1  Members is capped at $2,016,000.00, and if claims exceed that, they \n2  will be adjusted on a pro-rated basis so that the total payment to such \n3  Group Strip Search Class Members will not exceed that total. \n4  (e) Class administration costs. \n5  (f) $2,000,000 in attorneysโ fees and costs, plus class counsel costs not to \n6  exceed $65,000. \n(g) $30,000 damages award to each Named Plaintiff, of whom there are \n7 \nthree. \n8 \n3.  The Court approves the publication of summary class notice, as set \n9 \nforth in the Settlement Agreement.  \n10 \n4.  Defendants shall pay the Class Administrator all sums necessary to \n11 \neffectuate the terms of the Settlement Agreement and this Order, as set forth in the \n12 \nSettlement Agreement. \n13 \n5.  The Court preliminarily concludes that the terms of the Settlement \n14 \nAgreement satisfy the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(e) and due process \n15 \nrequirements.  \n16 \nII.  DEADLINES FOR NOTICE, FILING OBJECTIONS AND OPT-\n17 \nOUTS, AND DATE OF FAIRNESS HEARING \n18   \n6.  The Court has set the following dates for purposes of this class action: \n19 \n(a) Final class identifying information has already been provided to the \n20 \nclass administrator in computerized form by the Defendants or will be \n21 \nwithin ten (10) days of the date of this Order; \n22 \n(b) Mailing Class and Settlement Notice, and Claim Forms, to Class \n23 \nMembers, as defined in the Settlement Agreement (Exhibit A), to be \n24 \ncompleted within two consecutive business days from start to finish. \n25 \nThe first such mailing must be postmarked by March 14, 2011, and \n26 \nthe last such mailing must be postmarked within one business day \n27 \n \n{00868293.DOC}\n4\n               \n28 \n \nAMENDED PRELIMINARY APPROVAL ORDER \n29   \n \n30 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 130    Filed 02/23/11   Page 5 of 12\n   \n1  thereafter; \n2  (c) Publication of summary notice as provided in the Settlement \n3  Agreement (Exhibit A): effected by April 4, 2011; \n4  (d) Filing of Plaintiffsโ Motion for Award of Attorneysโ Fees and Costs: \n5  Must be filed by May 9, 2011; \n(e) Filing of Class Membersโ Objections to any aspect of the Settlement \n6 \n(including Plaintiffsโ Motion for Approval of Settlement of \n7 \nAttorneysโ Fees and Costs): Must be filed by June 13, 2011; \n8 \n(f) Deadline to opt-out: Must be postmarked or received by July 13, \n9 \n2011; \n10 \n(g) Deadline for filing class claims: Must be postmarked or received by \n11 \nJuly 13, 2011; \n12 \n(h) Filing of Opposition or Reply to Objections (including to objections \n13 \nto award of attorneysโ fees and costs): Must be filed by July 13, 2011; \n14 \nand \n15 \n(i) Final Approval Hearing: August 26, 2011. \n16 \n7.  In the event that the class notice is not mailed and initially published \n17 \nwithin the time specified herein, the subsequent dates contained herein will be \n18 \ndeferred for the number of additional days before such notice occurs without the \n19 \nneed for additional court approval. However, the Court must approve any change \n20 \nof the date of the Final Approval Hearing. \n21 \nIII.  CERTIFICATION OF CLASS AND STRIP SEARCH CLASS \n22 \n8.  The Court has previously certified Strip Search Classes under Fed. R. \n23 \nCiv. P. 23(b)(3). This is a class action, certified under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) for \n24 \ndamages and monetary relief. Class Members have a right to opt out of the \n25 \nsettlement. The Court hereby reaffirms the class definition as set forth in the Class \n26 \nCertification Order of April 1, 2009, and reiterated in the Settlement Agreement \n27 \n \n{00868293.DOC}\n5\n               \n28 \n \nAMENDED PRELIMINARY APPROVAL ORDER \n29   \n \n30 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 130    Filed 02/23/11   Page 6 of 12\n   \n1  attached as Exhibit A, including the class period of March 27, 2005, to October 1, \n2  2007.  \n3  9.  The Court reaffirms that all the criteria of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and \n4  (b)(3) are met for all the classes being settled herein. Specifically, the Court finds \n5  that all the criteria of Rule 23(a) are met, to wit, 1) that the class is so numerous \n6  that joinder of all members individually is impracticable, 2) that there are \nquestions of law or fact common to the class, 3) that Plaintiffsโ claims are typical \n7 \nof the claims of Class Members, and 4) that the persons representing the class \n8 \nmust be able fairly and adequately to protect the interests of all members of the \n9 \nclass. The Court further finds, pursuant to the provisions of Rule 23(b)(3) that 1) \n10 \nthe common factual and legal issues predominate over any such issues that affect \n11 \nonly individual Class Members, and 2) that a class action is superior to other \n12 \navailable methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy. The \n13 \nCourt further concludes that nothing in the partiesโ settlement alters, but rather, if \n14 \nanything, reinforces, the prior conclusions it reached regarding the desirability of \n15 \nthe class action mechanism as a means of resolving the claims in this case. \n16 \n10.  Pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement, if the total number \n17 \nof Opt-Outs exceeds 25, Defendants, in their sole discretion, may rescind their \n18 \nacceptance of the Settlement Agreement.  Defendants, in exercising this right of \n19 \nrescission, shall provide the Administrator and Class Counsel with written notice \n20 \nof rescission within 20 days after receipt of the Administratorโs report providing \n21 \nthe total number of Opt-Outs.  In the event Defendants exercise their right of \n22 \nrescission in accordance with this paragraph, any funds paid or deposited pursuant \n23 \nto this Settlement Agreement shall be returned to Defendants within 10 days of the \n24 \nexercise of the right to rescind, less any expenses, fees and costs incurred by the \n25 \nAdministrator. \n26 \n27 \n \n{00868293.DOC}\n6\n               \n28 \n \nAMENDED PRELIMINARY APPROVAL ORDER \n29   \n \n30 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 130    Filed 02/23/11   Page 7 of 12\n   \n1  11.  For purposes of settlement, the parties have determined Class \n2  Members from the Countyโs records and reached agreement regarding who \n3  belongs in the class for purposes of this settlement. Only persons who have been \n4  jointly identified by the parties through this process qualify as Class Members for \n5  purposes of this settlement. The process has entailed reaching agreement on the \ncomputer programming logic to be applied to the Defendantsโ data to determine \n6 \nwho fits the class definitions, and who are qualifies as Class Members. Anyone \n7 \nnot so identified is not a member of the class. If a person is not so identified, he or \n8 \nshe has the right to pursue his or her own claim should s/he so choose. Such \n9 \npersons are not considered opt-outs for they were never members of the classes \n10 \ncertified herein.  \n11 \n12.  Defendantsโ stipulations are for purposes of settlement only, and if \n12 \nthis Settlement is not finally approved or does not become effective for any \n13 \nreason, Defendants retain their right to contend that persons agreed on as Class \n14 \nMembers for this settlement are not in fact Class Members. \n15 \nIV.  NAMED PLAINTIFFS/CLASS REPRESENTATIVES \n16 \n13.  The class representatives are Marsial Lopez, Sandra Chavez, and \n17 \nTheodore Medina. \n18 \nV.  CLASS ADMINISTRATOR \n19 \n14.  The Court approves the retention of Gilardi & Co., LLC as Class \n20 \nAdministrator to administer the distribution of the Class and Settlement Notice, \n21 \nand publication of the Class and Settlement Notice, and to distribute the proceeds \n22 \nof the settlement to all eligible Class Members pursuant to the terms set forth in \n23 \nthe Settlement Agreement (Exhibit A) and the Final Order of Approval and \n24 \nSettlement (Exhibit D) should the Court grant final approval.  Gilardi was chosen \n25 \nby defense counsel pursuant to agreement between the parties preliminary to the \n26 \nfinalization of the Settlement Agreement, under which Defendants would choose a \n27 \n \n{00868293.DOC}\n7\n               \n28 \n \nAMENDED PRELIMINARY APPROVAL ORDER \n29   \n \n30 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 130    Filed 02/23/11   Page 8 of 12\n   \n1  reputable, experienced Third Party Administrator who is in the business of class \n2  administration. Plaintiffs agree that Gilardi meets this standard. \n3  15.  The Class Administratorโs responsibilities shall include mailing notice \n4  to identified and possible Class Members, publishing notice, processing claims \n5  and otherwise engaging in the activities needed to administer the class claims. The \n6  specific duties of the Class Administrator between this Preliminary Approval \nOrder and the Final Approval Order are set forth in ยถยถ 31-48 of the Settlement \n7 \nAgreement (Ex. A), the provisions of which are incorporated herein and approved. \n8 \n16.  The Class Administrator shall be compensated by Defendants for its \n9 \nservices, and any costs associated with them, in connection with notice and \n10 \nadministration and for the costs of giving mailed and published notice, pursuant to \n11 \nsuch orders as the Court may enter from time to time, including this one. Such \n12 \npayment shall be separate from the payment of Named Plaintiffs awards (see ยถ \n13 \n2(g) supra), attorneysโ fees and costs (see ยถ 2(f) supra), and payments to Class \n14 \nMembers who file claims that are accepted (see ยถยถ 2(a), (b), (c) and (d) supra). \n15 \nVI.  SPECIAL MASTER \n16 \n17.  The Special Master referred to in the Settlement Agreement shall be \n17 \nretired United States District Judge Raul A. Ramirez. \n18 \nVII.  CLASS COUNSEL \n19 \n18.  Barrett S. Litt and Paul J. Estuar are hereby confirmed as counsel for \n20 \nthe Class Representatives and the Class (โClass Counselโ).  \n21 \n19.

The parties shall provide the Class and Settlement Notice, and the \n4  Claim Form, to the Class Administrator for distribution according to the schedule \n5  set forth above. The Class Administrator shall additionally cause publication in the \n6  form of a modified and shortened form of the Class Notice, in the publications set \nforth in ยถ 35 of the Settlement Agreement (Ex. A) and on the schedule set forth \n7 \nabove.  \n8 \n22.  Defendants will provide the name, address, social security number, \n9 \ndate of birth, driver's license information, and any other identifying information, \n10 \nof Class Members to the Class Administrator in computerized form, to facilitate \n11 \nlocating them.  Such information shall be confidential, and may not be disclosed to \n12 \nanyone except counsel of record, the Class Administrator, and designated \n13 \nrepresentatives of Defendants.  Should the Defendants discover at any time any \n14 \nadditional information containing relevant class information, they shall promptly \n15 \nprovide it to the Class Administrator.  \n16 \n23.  Provision of the data specified in ยถ 22 is determined by the Court to be \n17 \nnecessary to identify and notify Class Members. Accordingly, the provision of \n18 \nsuch data is the product of this court order, is absolutely privileged and cannot be \n19 \nthe basis of any lawsuit, for privacy breach or otherwise, under any federal or state \n20 \ncause of action, in any federal or state court.  \n21 \n24.  Defendants shall provide the Class Administrator the electronic data \n22 \nspecified in ยถ 22 within ten (10) business days of the signing of this Preliminary \n23 \nApproval Order to the extent it has not already been so provided. \n24 \n25.  At least 10 days before the Fairness Hearing, the Class Administrator \n25 \nshall serve and file a sworn statement attesting to compliance with the provisions \n26 \nof this Order governing Class and Settlement Notice.

The Court approves the Class and Settlement Notice so long as it is \n3  materially similar to the proposed form attached as Exhibit C.  \n4  27.  The Court approves the Claim Form so long as it is materially similar \n5  to the proposed form attached as Exhibit B. \n6  28.  The Court finds that the notice required by the foregoing provisions of \nthis Order is the best notice practicable under the circumstances and shall \n7 \nconstitute due and sufficient notice of the Settlement and the Fairness Hearing to \n8 \nall Class Members and other persons affected by and/or entitled to participate in \n9 \nthe settlement, in full compliance with the notice requirements of Rule 23 of the \n10 \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure and due process. \n11 \nIX.  THE FAIRNESS HEARING \n12 \n29.  A Fairness Hearing shall be held on August 26, 2011, to consider: (a) \n13 \nthe fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy of the Settlement; (b) whether the Final \n14 \nOrder of Approval and Settlement, attached as Exhibit D, should be entered in its \n15 \ncurrent or some modified form; and (c) the application by Class Counsel for \n16 \napproval of the settlement of attorneysโ fees and costs (the โFee Motionโ). \n17 \n30.

Final determination of whether any such objector is a class \n12 \nmember who has standing to object shall be determined solely from the \n13 \nDefendantsโ records, from which the list of Class Members has been compiled. In \n14 \nthe absence of the timely filing and timely service of the notice of intention to \n15 \nappear and all other materials required by this paragraph, any objection shall be \n16 \ndeemed untimely and denied. \n17 \n32.  Pending final approval of the Settlement Agreement, no Class \n18 \nMember shall, either directly, representatively, or in any other capacity, \n19 \ncommence, prosecute against any Defendant or participate in any action or \n20 \nproceeding in any court or tribunal asserting any of the matters, claims, or causes \n21 \nof action that are to be released by the Settlement Agreement upon final approval. \n22 \n33.

In that event, the \n20 \namount that members  of that class receive will be adjusted on a  pro-rated basis, \n21 \nwhich would result in payment to individual Class Members of amounts lower than \nthose set forth above. The total amount paid to Post-Release Class Members is \n23 \ncapped at $2,335,830.00, and if claims exceed that, they will be adjusted on a pro- \n24 \nrated basis so that the total payment to such Post-Release Class Members (first and \n25 \nsecond time combined) will not exceed that total. Similarly,  the amount paid to \n26 \nGroup Strip Search  Class Members is capped at $2,016,000.00, and if claims \n27 \nexceed that, they will be adjusted on a pro-rated basis so that the total payment to \n28 \nsuch Group Strip Search Class Members will not exceed that total, \n10 \n{00850924.DOC} \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \nEXHIBIT A \nNN \n\nCCaassee  11::0077--ccvv--0000447744--DDLLBB      DDooccuummeenntt  112390--11        FFiilleedd  0022//2223//1111      PPaaggee  1122  ooff  2604\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB Document 125-2 Filed 01/22111 Page 11 of 19 \n29.

What Is The Class Action Lawsuit About? \nThis lawsuit involves the former policy and/or practice of the Kern County Jail of \na) strip searching inmates (i.e., requiring inmates to remove all clothing and submit to a \nvisual inspection, usually including a visual inspection of their breasts, genitals and \nrectum) in a group with other inmates, and b) strip searching inmates who became \nentitled to release from custody after going to court. The Class Period covers March 27, \n2005, through October 1, 2007 (when the policy was stopped). \n2. Who Is A Member Of The Class? \nYou are a member of the class if you meet the definition of either of the classes \n(summarized above and set forth fully in the judgeโs orders), and your claim can be verified \nfrom the records of the Kern County Sheriffโs Department, \nKern County must have a record of your being in custody so that officials can \nidentify you individually by true name and other methods of identification, and ascertain \nthat you qualify as someone who is a member of the class. Such records are the sole and \nfinal way it is determined who is a member of the class. \nYou have received this Notice either because (a) County of Kern records indicate \nthat you may be in the class, or (b) you contacted the Class Administrator in the belief \nthat you are in the class. Whether or not you qualify as a class member will be based \nupon records of the County of Kern. If those records do not contain your name and show \nyou to be within the definition of the class, you will not qualify. \n3. What Is The Purpose Of This Notice? \nYou have a right to know about a proposed Settlement of this class action lawsuit \nand about all of your options before the Court decides whether to give final approval to \nthe Settlement. Your rights may be affected by this lawsuit. \nThis information is being sent to every known person who is or may be a member \nof the class based upon the last known address available from the records of the Kern \nCounty Sheriffโs Department, and otherwise publicized to reach class members. \nThis Notice explains the lawsuit, the Settlement, your legal rights, what benefits \nare obtained, who is eligible and how to file a claim. \nThe Court in charge of the case is the United States District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of California, located in Fresno,  California. The case is known as  Lopez v, \nYoungblood et al.,  Case No. CV-F-07-0474 DLB. The people who brought the case are \ncalled Plaintiffs, and the people they sued are called Defendants. \nEXHIBIT C \n\nCCaassee 1 1:0:077--ccvv--0000447744--DDLLBB     D Dooccuummeennt t1 13209--13       F Filieledd 0 022/2/232/1/111     P Paaggee 2 58  ooff  1614\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB Document 125-4 Filed 01/22/11 Page 4 of 10 \n4. Why Is This A Class Action? \nIn a class action, one or more persons, called the Class Representative(s), sue on \nbehalf of a group of people who have similar claims - the Class Members. One court \nthen resolves the issues for all Class Members, except for those who exclude themselves \nfrom the class. \n5. Why Is There A Settlement? \nThis case has been going on for a very long time. Instead of continuing with the \ncase, both sides have agreed to a Settlement. That way, both sides are able to avoid the \nrisks and costs of a trial or appeal, the case can be resolved immediately, and the benefits \nof the Settlement can be made immediately available to the Class Members. The Class \nRepresentatives and their attorneys think that the proposed Settlement is fair to the Class \nMembers and the parties in the case, and think that the terms of the Settlement are a fair, \nreasonable and adequate resolution of this matter. Because this is a settlement, the \nDefendants do not formally admit liability, but they nonetheless agree to pay money to \nclass members. \n6. Are There Lawyers Representing You? \nThe Court has approved lawyers (called \"Class Counsel\") to collectively represent \nyou. You will not be asked to pay your own personal money for the services of these \nattorneys and their associates and staff in litigating this case and negotiating this \nSettlement. Instead, the lawyers will seek payment from the defendants, subject to final \napproval of the Court, as is described further below. Only Class Counsel may act on \nbehalf of the class, However, that does not prevent you from hiring your own lawyer to \nadvise you personally about your rights, options or obligations as a Class Member in this \nlawsuit. If you want to be represented by your own lawyer, you may hire one at your \nown expense. \n7. What Does The Settlement  Provide9 \n \nThe Settlement provides for the following payments to class members in three \ntiers: \na. A person who was subjected for the first time during the class period (between \nMarch 27, 2005, and October 1, 2007) to a Kern County strip search after a \nCourt ordered him or her to be released from all pending charges, and the \nperson was in fact entitled to immediate release based on that order, will \nreceive a payment of $1500 (subject to certain possible adjustments described \nbelow in ยถ 8). \nb. A person who was subjected for a second or more time during the class period \n(between March 27, 2005, and October 1, 2007) to a Kern County strip search \nafter a Court ordered him or her to be released from all pending charges, and \nthe person was in fact entitled to immediate release based on that order, will \nreceive a payment of $750 in addition to the $1500 for the first strip search \nri \nEXHIBIT C \n\"43 \n\nCCaassee 1 1:0:077--ccvv--0000447744--DDLLBB     D Dooccuummeennt t1 13209--13       F Filieledd 0 022/2/232/1/111     P Paaggee 2 69  ooff  1614\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB Document 125-4 Filed 01122111  Page 5 of 10 \n(again subject to certain possible adjustments described below in ยถ 8). If \nsomeone was strip searched after being ordered released more than two times \nduring the Class Period, s/he will not receive additional money for those \nsearches. \nc.  A person who was strip searched in a group while in Kern County custody \nduring the Class Period will receive a one time only payment (regardless of \nthe number of times the person was strip searched in a group) of $200 (subject \nto certain possible adjustments described below in ยถ 8). \nIn addition, the Agreement provides for the following other payments: \na) Separate payment by Defendants of settlement administration fees. \nb) Separate payment by Defendants of a total of $90,000 to the three \nindividuals ($30,000 each) who were Named Plaintiff and Class \nRepresentatives, and whose individual damages could be assessed prior to \nSettlement. These plaintiffs will receive more under the Settlement than \nother Class Members because of the role that they played in the litigation, \nand because of individualized damages determinations made in their cases. \nThe Court will finally approve whether to allow this amount or a different \n(but not higher) amount. \nC) (cid:9) An award of attorneysโ fees, to be separately paid by the Defendants, in the \namount of $2,000,000, subject to the final approval of the Court, and costs \nof litigation not to exceed $65,000. \nAs a result of this case, Kern County Jail no longer engages in routine strip \nsearches in groups or of those who are ordered by a court to be released, and are entitled \nto immediate release. \n8. (cid:9) What Are The Possible Adjustments To The Amounts Class \nRepresentatives Receive? \nAs indicated above, class members are to receive a fixed amount of money, which \nmay be adjusted under certain circumstances.  An adjustment would only occur if the \nnumber of claims substantially exceeds what the parties expect based on past  experience \nin cases of this kind. Specifically, the total amount paid to Post-Release Class Members \n(first and second time combined) is capped at approximately $2,335,000, and amount \npaid to Group Strip Search Class Members is capped at approximately  $2,015,000 (each \nrounded to the nearest $5000). If  claims exceed those amounts for either class, they will \nbe adjusted on a pro-rated basis so that the total payment for that class will not exceed its \nmaximum. \nThe reason for this maximum is that the defendants bargained that the settlement \nwould not cost them more than a certain amount, so this adjustment assures them that the \ntotal cost of the settlement will not exceed a certain amount. \nEXHIBIT C \n11 \n\nCCaassee 1 1:0:077--ccvv--0000447744--DDLLBB     D Dooccuummeennt t1 13209--13       F Filieledd 0 022/2/232/1/111     P Paaggee 3 70  ooff  1614\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB Document 125-4 Filed 01/22/11  Page 6 of 10 \nThe parties expect that the amount allocated for each class will be sufficient to \npay each class member the amounts set forth previously. However, it is possible that the \nparties are wrong, and that the amounts to be paid to class members will have to be \nadjusted. Thus, it is important that you understand that this is possible. \nEven if 100% of class members filed claims, and all were paid, post-release strip \nsearch class members would receive $420, and group strip search class members would \nreceive $56. \nThe Class Administrator shall deduct from any claim payment the amount owed by a \nclaim participant for liens or court orders for restitution, child support, debts owed to the \nCounty of Kern or any statutory liens. By filing a Claim Form, you agree to allow the Class \nAdministrator access to your records regarding child support or potential statutory liens. \nHowever, no more than 50% of the amount due to a claimant may be deducted to pay such \nrestitution, debts or liens, so all qualifying claimants will receive some money even if such \ndeductions occur. A Class Member from whom lien deductions will be taken will have the \nright to present evidence to a retired judge that s/he does not owe the money on which the lien \nis based; the retired judgeโs decision on that issue will be final. \n10. (cid:9) Will I Receive Anything From The Settlement? \nIf it is verified that you are a Class Member, and you file an approved claim \nwithin the time set by the Court, you will be entitled to receive compensation in \naccordance with the schedule described above. \nIL. (cid:9) Do I Do To Get Money? \nIf you wish to receive money from the Settlement, you must complete and submit \nthe accompanying Claim Form. Read the instructions on the Claim Form carefully. All \nClaim Forms must be completed- . โAnd .stmarked (or received by the \nAdministrator) no later than  _, 2011, but it is recommended that you complete \nand mail your Claim Form as soon as possible.  If you do not timely and properly \nsubmit your Claim Form, you will not receive any money  from the Settlement. if \nyou need a copy of a Claim Form, please call   (toll free), or write to the \nLopez v. Youngblood  Settlement Administrator,  (cid:9) , CA \nor download the Form from the Internet at \n12. (cid:9) Can I Exclude Myself From The Settlement? \nIf you do not want to be a member of the class, then you must take steps to get out \nof the class. This is called \"excluding yourself\" from, and sometimes is referred to as \n\"opting out\" of, the class. \nEXHIBIT C \n40 \n\nCCaassee 1 1:0:077--ccvv--0000447744--DDLLBB     D Dooccuummeennt t1 13209--13       F Filieledd 0 022/2/232/1/111     P Paaggee 3 81  ooff  1614\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB Document 125-4 Filed 01/22/11 Page 7 of 10 \n13. What Do I Do To Exclude Myself From The Lawsuit? \nTo exclude yourself, you must send a letter by First-Class mail clearly stating that \nyou want to be excluded from Lopez v. Youngblood, et al.  Be sure to include your name, \naddress, telephone number and signature. The name and address of your attorney is not \nsufficient.  You must mail your Exclusion Request, postmarked no later than \n,2011 to: \nLopez v, Youngblood, et al.  Settlement Administrator \n____,CA \nYou cannot exclude yourself on the phone or by email. If you are excluded, you \nwill not be entitled to get any money from the Settlement, and you cannot object to the \nSettlement. Nor will you be legally bound by anything that happens in this lawsuit. \nUnless you exclude yourself from the class, you remain in the class and give up \nall of your rights against the Defendants except those available to you under this \nSettlement. That means that, if you donโt exclude yourself and you also donโt file a \nclaim, you will receive no money but still lose your rights against the Defendants. So  be \nsure to file your claim. \n14. What Is The Release Of Claims? \nIf you are a class member and have not excluded yourself from the class as \ndescribed above, you are waiving all your rights to all claims during the class period \nrelated to strip searches by the Kern County Sheriffs Department falling within the \nCourtโs definition of the Classes, even those you are not aware of at present. This waiver \nincludes a waiver of the provisions of California Civil Code ยง1542, which provides that \n\"a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect \nto exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or \nher must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.\" By not \nexcluding yourself, you will be giving up unsuspected claims in these areas related to \nstrip searches by the Kern County Sheriffs Department. However, you will not be  giving \nup any other claim(s) that you may have against Kern County for conduct not covered by \nthis Settlement (for example, a false arrest or battery by a police officer). \n15. If! Do Not Like The Settlement Or Object To The Attorneysโ Fees, \nHow Do I Tell The Court? \nIf you are and remain a Class Member, you can object to the Settlement if you do \nnot like any part of it, or you may object to the request for Attorneysโ Fees. You must \ngive the reason why you think that the Court should not approve the Settlement or the \nrequested Attorneysโ Fees. A mere statement that \"I object\" will not be sufficient. Do not \ncontact the Court orally to object. Rather, you  must send  a written statement with the \ncase name and number  (Lopez v. Youngblood, et  al.,  Case No. CV-F-07-0474 DLB) at \nthe top of the page. In addition,  provide your name, your address (just giving the address \nof an attorney who represents you is not sufficient), your telephone number, the date of \narrest to the extent known, your signature and the reason why you object. If you are \nEXHIBIT C \nME \n\nCCaassee 1 1:0:077--ccvv--0000447744--DDLLBB     D Dooccuummeennt t1 13209--13       F Filieledd 0 022/2/232/1/111     P Paaggee 3 92  ooff  1614\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB Document 125-4 Filed 01/22/11 Page 8 of 10 \nrepresented by a lawyer, you should also give the name, address and telephone number of \nthat lawyer.  You must mail  your objections and any  supporting papers by First-\nClass mail, postmarked no later than   2011, to the Court and counsel as \nfollows: \nU.S. District Court  Barrett S.

You can object only if you stay in the class. If you object and the Court \nrejects your objection, you remain a member of the class and will be hound by any \noutcome of the case. Excluding yourself is telling the Court that you do not want to be \npart of the class. If you exclude yourself, you have no basis to object because the case no \nlonger affects you. If you do object, you should also file a claim form. \n17. When And Where Will The Court Decide Whether To Approve The \nSettlement And Attorneysโ Fees? \nThe Court has scheduled the Fairness Hearing for 10:00 A.M. on   \n2011, in the United States District Courthouse for the Eastern District of California, 2500 \nTulare Street, Fresno, CA 93721, in the courtroom of Magistrate Judge Dennis Beck, \nCourtroom No. 9. At this Hearing, Judge Beck will consider whether the Settlement is \nfair, reasonable and adequate, and will determine the amount of Attorneysโ Fees and \ncosts to be awarded. If there are any objections, the Court will consider and rule on them. \nWe do not know how long this process will take. We do not know if the Hearing will be \ncontinued. There will not be a new notice if it is. You may  speak at the Hearing with the \npermission of the Court, but only if you have submitted your comments or objections as \ndescribed above. \n18. Do I Have To Come To The Hearing? \nNo. You may, but need not, attend the Hearing. Class Counsel will answer any \nquestions the Court may have. However, you may come if you choose, at your own \nexpense. If you sent a written objection, you do not have to come to Court to talk about \n\nCCaassee  11::0077--ccvv--0000447744--DDLLBB      DDooccuummeenntt  112390--31        FFiilleedd  0022//2223//1111      PPaaggee  1303  ooff  1614\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB Document 125-4 Filed 01/22/11 Page 9 of 10 \nit. As long as you properly submitted your written objection, the Court will consider it. \nYou may also pay your own lawyer to attend, but it is not necessary. \n19. May I Speak At The Hearing? \nYou will not be heard unless you have submitted your comments or objections. \nYou cannot speak at the Hearing if you exclude yourself. If you have submitted an \nobjection, the Court will decide whether or not to hear from you verbally as well. \n20. What Happens If I Do Nothing At All? \nIf you do nothing, your rights will be affected. You will be bound by the terms of \nthe Settlement and you will be agreeing to a release of the claims that are contained in the \nSettlement. However, because you did not file a claim, you will not be entitled to any \nmoney from the Settlement, \n21. When Will I Receive Money From the Settlement? \nNo money will be paid until after the Settlement is approved and all possibilities \nof appeal are completed. After that, it will likely take two to three months, and quite \npossibly more, to process all the claims, calculate the amount due to each Class Member \nand receive the money to send to the Class Members. \nIf you file a claim and do not receive money within eight months after \n2011, which is the last day to mail or file a claim, check the website for this \ncase about when mailings are expected, or contact the Class Administrator by either \ncalling _________ or writing to: \nLopez v. Youngblood  Settlement Administrator \n-_, _C,CAA    \nWe strongly recommend that you keep a copy of your Claim Form. You may \nwant to send the Form in by certified mail so it can be verified, but you are not required \nto do so. \nRemember that it is possible that the Court will approve the settlement, but that \nthere could be an appeal that would substantially delay any payment if it were successful. \n22. What Happens If There Is Not A Final Settlement? \nUnder certain circumstances, it is possible the settlement might not go through \n(for example, if there are too many people who decide not to participate or if the court for \nsome reason does not approve the settlement). In that situation, the case would go \nforward and go to trial. \n23, (cid:9) Are There More Details About The Settlement? \nThis Notice merely summarizes the proposed Settlement.

Payments To The Class By The Defendants \n10  14. As set forth in more detail in the Settlement Agreement, the \nDefendants agreed to pay all Class Members who file claims on the following \n11 \nI terms. \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n23 \n24 \nz \n26 \n27 \n28 \n(cid:9)\nI  (00851460.DOC)  7 \nEXHIBIT D \n\nCCaassee 1 1:0:077--ccvv--0000447744--DDLLBB     D Dooccuummeennt t1 13209--14       F Filieledd 0 022/2/232/1/111     P Paaggee 4 93  ooff  1684\nase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB Document 125-5 Filed 01/22/11 Page 8 of 17 \n1  payments will be made to persons subjected to more than two such \n2  1.. \na1cI1e.) \n3  c. Group Strip Search Settlement Class Member: A Group Strip Search \n4  Settlement Class Member is a SCM who meets the definition of a Group \n5  Strip Settlement Class Member provided above and was subjected to a \n6  group strip/vcb search during the Class Period. Defendants agree to pay a \n7  SCM who qualifies as a Post-Release Class Member 1 a sum of $200. No \n8  additional sums shall be paid to a Group Strip Search Settlement Class \n9  Member who was subjected to a post-release strip/vcb search more than \n10  one time (i.e., each Group Strip Search Settlement Class Member shall be \n11  paid $200 no matter how many times the individual was subjected to a \ngroup strip search). \n12 \n13  15. A SCM who is a Post-Release Class Member is also entitled to \n14  payment as a Group Strip Search Class Member in addition to the payment s/he \nreceives as a Post-Release Class Member, \n15 \n16  16. Notwithstanding the amounts set forth above to be paid LU caCuL  Class \nMember, the parties have agreed to a maximum payout for each class, the amount \n17 \nof which was derived from their joint estimate that claims are unlikely to exceed \n18 \napproximately 28% of the claSs members  (and, based on past experience, will \n19 \nlikely be meaningfully lower than that). Accordingly, the amounts  to be paid Class \n20 \nMembers (not including class representatives) will be adjusted if the amount  to be \n21 \nawarded eligible Class Members in either the Post-Release or Group Strip Search \n22 \nmake claims that exceed the total amount to be paid to that class. In that event, the \n23 \namount that members of that class receive will be adjusted on a pro-rated basis, \n24 \nwhich would result in payment to individual Class Members of amounts lower than \n25 \nthose set forth above, Thus, the total amount paid to Post-Release Class Members \n26 \nis capped at $2,335,830.00, and if claims exceed that, they will be adjusted on a \n27 \n28 \n(00851460.DOc) \n\nCCaassee  11::0077--ccvv--0000447744--DDLLBB      DDooccuummeenntt  112390--41        FFiilleedd  0022//2223//1111      PPaaggee  1404  ooff  1684\nse 1:07-cv-00474-DLB Document 125-5 Filed 01/22/11  Page 9 of 17 \npro-rated basis so that the total payment to such Post-Release Class Members (first \nand second time combined) will not exceed that total. Similarly, the amount paid to \nGroup Strip Search Class Members is capped at $2,016,000.00, and if claims \nexceed that, they will be adjusted on a pro-rated basis so that the total payment to \nsuch Group Strip Search Class Members will not exceed that total. \n17. Within thirty (30) calendar days from the date the Claims \nAdministrator notifies counsel for Defendants of the amount necessary to satisfy \n8  all proper claims, the Defendants shall have deposited with the Class Administrator \n9  the sums necessary to pay all claims made and approved to date. In the event that, \n10  for some reason, there are timely claims not yet resolved, Defendants shall \n11  continue to provide on an ongoing basis such sums as may be required to continue \n12  to pay approved claims until all such claims are paid or determined not to qualify \n13  for payment. \n14  18. The Administrator shall make payments to SCMs who have flied \n15  timely claims in accordance with this Settlement Agreement within a reasonable \n16  time, with a goal of within 120 days after the Effective Date. If a check to a SCM \n17  is not cashed within three months of its mailing, the Administrator shall hold the \nfunds for nine additional months, during which time it shall make reasonable \n18 \nefforts to contact the person to whom the  un-cashed check was written to make \n19 \narrangements for its chasing or reissuance. Any such funds not cashed within one \n20 \nyear of its mailing shall revert to Defendants, \n21 \nX (cid:9) Named Plaintiffsโ Distribution \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n{00851460.Doc} \n\nCCaassee  11::0077--ccvv--0000447744--DDLLBB      DDooccuummeenntt  112390--41        FFiilleedd  0022//2223//1111      PPaaggee  1415  ooff  1684\n1:07-cv-00474-DLB Document 125-5 Filed  01/22111  Page 10 of 17 \nthe Lift, Estuar & Kitson Client Trust Account by wire at the same time that the \n2  class attorneysโ fees are paid. \n(cid:9)\n3  20. The Court concludes that this award is justified because the Named \n4  Plaintiffs made contributions to the class as a whole, justifying awards to them \n5  higher than those to the general class. In addition, the Named Plaintiffsโ \n6  individualized damages claims, including special damages, are a factor in the \n7  determination of the sum they receive. Such determinations cannot reasonably be \n8  made for Class Members in general without unduly consuming funds for \n9  administrative costs that will otherwise be available for distribution to Class \n10  Members. Any fees due Class Counsel for their representation of the Named \n11  Plaintiffs are encompassed within the Class Fund Attorneysโ Fees referenced \nherein. \n12 \nXL Class Fund Attorneys Fees \n13 \n(cid:9)\n21. The Court has reviewed the Plaintiffsโ counselโs claim for attorneysโ \n14 \nfees and finds them well within the accepted range for class fund fees for the \n15 \nreasons contained in the Order Granting Plaintiffs Motion for Attorneysโ Fees and \n16 \nCosts. In addition to and separate from any other payments called for in this Order, \nthe Released Parties shall pay a one-time only lump sump payment of $2,000,000, \n18 \nto be paid to the LEK Client Trust Account, as Class Counsel attorneysโ fees, plus \n19 \ncosts not to exceed $65,000. This payment represents a full and final settlement of \n20 \nall past, present and future attorneysโ fees and all past, present and future ordinary \n21 \nand extraordinary costs. Defendants or their insurers will  make a single wire \n22 \ntransfer to the LEK Client Trust Account that will include the approved attorneysโ \n23 \nfees and costs, and the funds awarded to the class representatives, in a single \n24 \ntransfer (hereafter the \"Class Rep/Fee Transfer\") within thirty (30) days of the \nI Effective Date. \n26 \n27 \n28 \n(cid:9) EDI \n{00851460.DOC} \n[i4ItI:IaI \n\nCCaassee  11::0077--ccvv--0000447744--DDLLBB      DDooccuummeenntt  112390--41        FFiilleedd  0022//2223//1111      PPaaggee  1426  ooff  1684\nso 1:07-cv-00474-DLB Document 125-5 Filed 01/22111  Page 11 of 17 \n1  XII, CLASS-WIDE PROSPECTIVE RELIEF STRIP SEARCH CLASS \n2  22.

Class Administrator \n10  24. The Court reaffirms the appointment of Gilardi & Co., LLC as Class \n11  Administrator (hereafter \"Gilardi\"), Defendants shall pay all past and future costs \n12  of class administration as a separate and distinct payment from all other payments \nset forth in this Order. \n13 \n25.

The first round payment shall be paid to SCMs who filed timely Proof of \n5  Claim and Release Forms and whose claims have been determined to be valid, \n6  within a reasonable time, with a goal to be within 120 days after the Effective \n7  Date. If for some reason, there are SCMs at that time whose claims remain \n8 \n(cid:9)\n9  28.

On June 21, 2007, Plaintiffs Marsial Lopez, Sandra Chavez,\n6 and Theodore Medina, individually and as class representatives, filed a First Amended\n7 Complaint (โFACโ) against Defendants.  Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief and damages resulting\n8 from the strip and/or visual body cavity searches of prisoners by the Kern County Sheriffโs\n9 Department. \n10 The FAC pursues causes of action for violation of the Fourth, Eighth and Fourteenth\n11 Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, violation of Article I, ยงยง 1, 7, 13 and 17 of the California\n12 Constitution and state law violations.  Plaintiffs allege that Defendants maintained a policy of\n13 indiscriminately strip/body cavity searching all or a large number of persons being processed into\n14 the jail without limitation on the number of persons who can see, hear or observe the searches. \n15 Plaintiffs also allege that Defendants improperly strip searched detainees who had been ordered\n16 released.\n17 On July 17, 2008, Defendants filed a joint motion for summary adjudication regarding\n18 group strip searches.  Defendants contend that the group strip searches at issue do not violate the\n19 Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  In addition, Defendants argue that Plaintiffsโ equal\n20 protection claim state law claims fail as a matter of law. \n21 Pursuant to a briefing schedule, Plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motion on September\n22 16, 2008, along with a statement of disputed and undisputed facts and objections to the\n23 declaration of Ian Silva.  On October 3, 2008, Defendants filed a reply and objections to the\n24 Declaration of Paul J. Estuar filed in support of Plaintiffsโ motion. \n25 On November 7, 2008, Defendants filed their second joint motion for summary\n26 adjudication regarding court returnees, qualified immunity and Eleventh Amendment immunity. \n27\n1Plaintiffsโ motion to certify the class, Plaintiffsโ motion to strike and Plaintiffsโ motion to amend the FAC\n28\nalso are pending before the Court. \n2\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 91      Filed 03/31/2009     Page 3 of 32\n1 Defendants contend that (1) the searches of certain Plaintiffs who assert that their constitutional\n2 rights were violated when they were subjected to strip searches after returning to the jail\n3 following a court appearance in which they were ordered released were reasonable; (2)\n4 Defendants Yougblood and Wimbish are immune from liability because the law was not clearly\n5 established that searching post-arraignment detainees in small groups violates Plaintiffsโ rights\n6 under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and violates the Equal Protection Clause; (3) the\n7 Sheriff is a state actor and immune from a ยง 1983 suit; and (4) the County should be dismissed\n8 from this action.\n9 Plaintiffs filed an opposition to Defendantsโ second motion on November 21, 2008, along\n10 with a statement of disputed and undisputed facts and the Declaration of Barrett S. Litt and\n11 Donald W. Cook.  Defendants filed a reply and objections to Plaintiffsโ statement of facts on\n12 December 5, 2008. \n13 On November 7, 2008, Plaintiffs also filed their cross-motion for partial summary\n14 judgment and/or summary adjudication.  Plaintiffs seek a determination that (1) KCSOโs policy\n15 of strip searching persons ordered released from custody violated the Fourth Amendment; (2)\n16 KCSOโs policy of group strip searching prisoners violated the Fourth Amendment; (3) the strip\n17 search policies violated Plaintiffsโ state constitutional rights pursuant to Cal. Const. Art. I, ยง 1\n18 (privacy), Cal. Const. Art. I, ยง 13 (unreasonable searches) and Cal. Const. Art. I, ยง 7 (equal\n19 protection); and (4) the entity defendants are liable under federal and state law.\n20 Defendants filed an opposition to Plaintiffsโ cross-motion for summary adjudication on\n21 November 21, 2008, along with a statement of undisputed facts and objections to the declaration\n22 of Donald W. Cook.  Plaintiffs filed a reply on December 6, 2008.\n23 FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n24 A. Jail Facilities\n25 Defendant KCSO operates four different jail facilities.  These facilities include Central\n26 Receiving Facility (โCRFโ), Ridgecrest, Mojave, and Lerdo.  The main function of the CRF\n27 facility is booking and receiving arrestees coming straight off the street.  Since at least 2003, pre-\n28\n3\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 91      Filed 03/31/2009     Page 4 of 32\n1 arraignment misdemeanor arrestees at CRF were not subject to strip searches on a routine basis,\n2 either before or after their first court appearance.  \n3 If not released from CRF, arrestees are transported to the Kern County Superior Court\n4 (โSuperior Courtโ) for their initial court appearance.  After their initial court appearance,\n5 arrestees are transported back to CRF for either (a) housing in the Lerdo jail if remanded to\n6 custody or (b) to be released from custody at CRF.  Post-arraignment prisoners, including those\n7 serving sentences, are housed at Lerdo.  Lerdo is divided into four different divisions: pretrial,\n8 maximum-medium (โmax-medโ), female minimum and male minimum.\n9 B. KCSO Inmate Searches\n10 Procedure D of KCSO Policy C-500 specifies that persons in the general inmate\n11 population (not pre-arraignment detainees):\n12 may be subjected to a strip search or visual body cavity search in the following\nsituations:  \n13\nโข After an inmate has left the facility and returned (i.e., medical appointment, court,\n14 etc.)\nโข After an inmate laborer has completed their assigned duties inside or outside the\n15 facility and is returning to their housing area.\nโข After any contact visit.\n16 โข If an officer has a reasonable suspicion that an inmate is concealing a weapon or\ncontraband and that a strip search or visual body cavity search will result in\n17 discovery of the weapon or contraband. \n18 KCSO, Detentions Bureau Policies and Procedures, Search Procedures C-500, p. 5; Exhibit E to\n19 the Declaration of Terrence Cassidy.\n20 Per KCSO Search Procedure, a strip search involves a โvisual inspection of the\n21 underclothing, female breasts, buttocks, or genitalia of such person.โ  KCSO, Detentions Bureau\n22 Policies and Procedures, Search Procedures C-500, p. 2.  A strip search includes a visual body\n23 cavity search.  A visual body cavity search includes a โvisual inspection of the anus and/or\n24 vaginal area; generally requiring the subject to bend over and spread the cheeks of the buttocks,\n25 to squat, and/or otherwise expose body cavity orifices.โ  Id.  From 2003 to present, the manner of\n26 strip searching prisoners has not changed.  \n27 From January 2005 to October 2007, the Kern County Sheriffโs Department conducted a\n28 strip/visual body cavity (โstrip/vbcโ) of all inmates who were moved from Lerdo to court and\n4\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 91      Filed 03/31/2009     Page 5 of 32\n1 back.  Upon arrival at Lerdo, prisoners were routinely subjected to a strip/visual body cavity\n2 search without regard to the reasonable suspicion standard.  This search policy included both\n3 prisoners housed for the first time at Lerdo following an initial court appearance and prisoners\n4 who were previously housed at Lerdo but who had been ordered released following a court\n5 appearance. \n6 Prior to October 2007, all such strip/visual body cavity searches were group searches\n7 conducted in view of other inmates.  Each prisoner could observe the searches of other prisoners\n8 in the group.  There were no partitions or other barriers to prevent such observation. \n9  In October 2007, Defendants stopped โgroup strip searches,โ adopting an updated policy. \n10 KCSO, Detentions Bureau Policies and Procedures, Strip and Body Cavity Searches C-550, p. 2;\n11 Exhibit 1 to Declaration of Paul Estuar in Support of Plaintiffsโ Opposition to Motion for\n12 Summary Adjudication.  Defendants now employ privacy partitions or booths when conducting\n13 strip searches at Lerdo facilities.\n14 C. Individual Plaintiffs\n15 1. Marsial Lopez\n16 From about July 2005 to November 2006, Plaintiff Marsial Lopez was a prisoner in the\n17 Kern County Jail, awaiting trial and resolution of criminal charges filed against him.  Between\n18 July 2005 and November 2006, Plaintiff Lopez made numerous appearances in Superior Court\n19 regarding pending criminal charges.  After each appearance, he was returned to Lerdo.  Upon his\n20 arrival at Lerdo, Plaintiff Lopez was subjected to a strip/vbc search.  On November 6, 2006,\n21 Plaintiff Lopez appeared in Superior Court.  At that time, the court dismissed all charges against\n22 him and ordered his release.  Plaintiff Lopez returned to Lerdo and was subjected to a strip/vbc\n23 search.\n24 2. Sandra Chavez\n25 On February 17, 2007, KCSO deputies arrested Plaintiff Sandra Chavez.  She was housed\n26 at CRF where she was subjected to a strip/vbc search\n27 ///\n28 ///\n5\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 91      Filed 03/31/2009     Page 6 of 32\n1 3. Theodore Medina\n2 On or about May 10, 2006, KCSO deputies arrested Plaintiff Theodore Medina.  He was\n3 housed at Lerdo.  On May 26, 2006, he appeared in Superior Court at which time the court\n4 sentenced him to time served.  Plaintiff Medina returned to Lerdo and was subjected to a\n5 strip/vbc search.\n6 D. Court Returnees\n7 Between January 2005 and October 2007, the Kern County Sheriffโs Department\n8 subjected all inmates who were returning from court to a strip/vbc search .  Inmates housed at the\n9 Lerdo facility of the Kern County Jail are required to be transported to one of the Kern County\n10 Superior Court locations to appear regarding the criminal charges against them.  Hundreds of\n11 inmates are transported to court each day from the Lerdo facility.  Sometimes at a court\n12 appearance, the court orders that the inmate should be released.  Reasons for release may include\n13 release on the inmateโs own recognizance, posting bail or complete dismissal of the criminal\n14 charges. \n15 When the court issues an order of release, the clerk of the court enters the courtโs order\n16 into the local computerized Criminal Justice Information System (โCJISโ), as well as the reason\n17 for the order of release.  After the clerk enters the information, CJIS creates a โflagโ on the\n18 inmateโs CJIS record.  For jail staff to locate the flag, they must run a CJIS search to pull the\n19 records with the specific, court entered flag.  Once jail staff runs the CJIS search for the inmates\n20 ordered released, each of these inmate records must be checked to determine whether there are\n21 other reasons for the inmate to remain in jail.  Reasons for holding the inmates after a court-\n22 ordered release on a particular criminal case may include the existence of other ongoing criminal\n23 cases, holds or warrants.  To conduct this check, the local CJIS system must be searched, along\n24 with the statewide California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (โCLETSโ).  If it is\n25 determined that there is no other basis for the inmate to be retained in the jail, then the inmate is\n26 released. \n27 ///\n28 ///\n6\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 91      Filed 03/31/2009     Page 7 of 32\n1 DISCUSSION\n2 A. Summary Judgment Standard\n3 Summary judgment is appropriate when no genuine issue of material fact exists and the\n4 moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317\n5 (1986).  โIf the party moving for summary judgment meets its initial burden of identifying for the\n6 court the portions of the materials on file that it believes demonstrate the absence of any genuine\n7 issues of material fact,โ the burden of production shifts and โthe non moving party must set forth,\n8 by affidavit or as otherwise provided in Rule 56, โspecific facts showing that there is a genuine\n9 issue for trial.โโ  T.W. Electric Service, Inc. v. Pacific Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 630\n10 (9th Cir. 1987) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e)).  As to the specific facts offered by the nonmoving\n11 party, the court does not weigh conflicting evidence, but draws all inferences in the light most\n12 favorable to the nonmoving party.  Id. at 630-31.\n13 If the moving party meets its initial responsibility, the burden then shifts to the opposing\n14 party to establish that a genuine issue as to any material fact actually does exist.  Matsushita Elec.\n15 Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586 (1986).\n16 In attempting to establish the existence of this factual dispute, the opposing party may not\n17 rely upon the denials of its pleadings, but is required to tender evidence of specific facts in the\n18 form of affidavits, and/or admissible discovery material, in support of its contention that the\n19 dispute exists.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e); Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 586 n.11.  The opposing party must\n20 demonstrate that the fact in contention is material, i.e., a fact that might affect the outcome of the\n21 suit under the governing law, Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986); T.W.\n22 Elec. Serv.,809 F.2d at 630, and that the dispute is genuine, i.e., the evidence is such that a\n23 reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party, Wool v. Tandem Computers, Inc.,\n24 818 F.2d 1433, 1436 (9th Cir. 1987).\n25 In the endeavor to establish the existence of a factual dispute, the opposing party need not\n26 establish a material issue of fact conclusively in its favor.  It is sufficient that the claimed factual\n27 dispute be shown to require a jury or judge to resolve the partiesโ differing versions of the truth at\n28 trial.  T.W. Elec. Serv., 809 F.2d at 630.  Thus, the โpurpose of summary judgment is to โpierce\n7\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 91      Filed 03/31/2009     Page 8 of 32\n1 the pleadings and to assess the proof in order to see whether there is a genuine need for trial.โโ \n2 Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e) advisory committeeโs note on 1963\n3 amendments).\n4 In resolving the summary judgment motion, the court examines the pleadings,\n5 depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if\n6 any.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). The evidence of the opposing party is to be believed, Anderson, 477\n7 U.S. at 255, and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the facts placed before the\n8 court must be drawn in favor of the opposing party, Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587 (citing United\n9 States v. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 655 (1962) (per curiam).  Nevertheless, inferences are not\n10 drawn out of the air, and it is the opposing partyโs obligation to produce a factual predicate from\n11 which the inference may be drawn.  Richards v. Nielsen Freight Lines, 602 F.Supp. 1224, 1244-\n12 45 (E.D. Cal. 1985), aff'd, 810 F.2d 898, 902 (9th Cir. 1987).  \n13 Finally, to demonstrate a genuine issue, the opposing party โmust do more than simply\n14 show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts . . . .  Where the record taken\n15 as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no\n16 โgenuine issue for trial.โโ  Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587 (citation omitted).\n17 B. Discussion2\n18 1. Fourth Amendment\n19 In Count One, Plaintiffs contend that Defendants violated Plaintiffsโ rights to be secure in\n20 their persons against unreasonable searches and seizures as guaranteed by the Fourth and\n21 Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  FAC, at ยถ 46.  Plaintiffs seek\n22 recovery of damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.  FAC, at ยถ 46. \n23 The Fourth Amendment protects prisoners from unreasonable searches and seizures. \n24 Strip searches that are excessive, vindictive, harassing, or unrelated to any legitimate penological\n25\n26\n2The Court has reviewed Plaintiffsโ amended complaint, the cross-motions for summary judgment, the\n27 oppositions, and the replies.  The Court declines to exhaustively list every argument forwarded, every fact recited,\nand every piece of evidence submitted by the parties.  Omission in this order of reference to various arguments, facts,\n28 or evidence should not be interpreted by the parties as an indication that the Court overlooked that argument, fact, or\npiece of evidence.\n8\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 91      Filed 03/31/2009     Page 9 of 32\n1 interest are not reasonable.  Michenfelder v. Sumner, 860 F.2d 328, 332 (9th Cir. 1988).  Neither\n2 the United States Supreme Court nor the Ninth Circuit has yet held that prisoners retain no\n3 privacy rights under the Fourth Amendment.  Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 526 (1984)\n4 (โFourth Amendment proscription against unreasonable searches does not apply within the\n5 confines of the prison cell.โ) (emphasis added); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 558 (1979)\n6 (โassuming [without deciding] that inmates, both convicted prisoners and pretrial detainees,\n7 retain some Fourth Amendment rights upon commitment to a corrections facility . . . .โ); Somers\n8 v. Thurman, 109 F.3d 614 (9th Cir. 1997).  The Ninth Circuit has found that prisoners retain a\n9 limited right to bodily privacy.  Michenfelder, 860 F.2d at 333.\n10 In analyzing whether searches of detainees violate the Fourth Amendment, the Supreme\n11 Court set forth a balancing test in Bell, 441 U.S. at 559.  In Bell, the Supreme Court held that\n12 visual body cavity searches of pre-trial detainees conducted after every contact visit with a person\n13 from outside the institution did not violate the Fourth Amendment.  Id. at 558.  \n14 The Bell court explained:\n15 The test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise\ndefinition or mechanical application.  In each case it requires a balancing of the\n16 need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the\nsearch entails.  Courts must consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the\n17 manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in\nwhich it is conducted.\n18\nId. at 559.  \n19\nThe Ninth Circuit applied the Bell factors in Way v. County of Ventura, 445 F.3d 1157,\n20\n1179 (9th Cir. 2006).  In so doing, the Ninth Circuit found unconstitutional a strip search/visual\n21\nbody cavity inspection of an arrestee booked on a misdemeanor drug charge, which was\n22\nconducted pursuant to a blanket policy of strip searching all arrestees on all drug offenses before\n23\nplacement in the general population.  \n24\nGroup Strip Searches\n25\nIn this case, Plaintiffs are not contesting the practice of conducting strip searches on in-\n26\ncustody inmates.  Instead, they are contesting the practice of group strip searches.  There is a\n27\npaucity of case law in this circuit limited to the specific issue before the Court, i.e., the\n28\n9\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 91      Filed 03/31/2009     Page 10 of 32\n1 constitutionality of strip searches conducted in groups.  As such, the Court looks to the Bell\n2 factors and considers the scope, place, manner and justification to assess KCSOโs group strip\n3 searches.  \n4 The scope of intrusion associated with strip and/or visual body cavity searches has been\n5 described as a โโfrightening and humiliatingโ invasion, even when conducted โwith all due\n6 courtesy.โโ Way, 445 F.3d at 1160 (quoting Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 617 (9th Cir.\n7 1984).  The place of search at issue is primarily the Lerdo facility.3  The searches are conducted\n8 in view of other inmates in small groups. \n9 In connection with the manner of the search, Defendants argue that the searches were not\n10 โexcessive in their performance or ... calculated harassment,โ pointing to severe personnel\n11 limitations and security concerns to justify searches in small groups.  (Defendantsโ Memorandum\n12 of Points and Authorities in Support of Motion for Summary Adjudication (โDefs.โ Mem. Supp.\n13 Summ. J.โ)  9.)  Defendantsโ assertion that the searches were not excessive or conducted in a\n14 harassing manner is conclusory and does not counter the undisputed fact that strip/vbc searches\n15 were conducted in a group setting. \n16 To support their argument regarding the reasonable nature of the searches, Defendants\n17 direct the court to Fernandez v. Rapone, 926 F.Supp. 255 (D. Mass. 1996) and Zunker v.\n18 Bertrand, 798 F.Supp. 1365 (E.D. Wis. 1992), which involved group strip searches of inmates. \n19 The Court initially notes that neither case is binding authority, but considers Defendantsโ\n20 arguments in reliance on these cases.  In Fernandez, the Massachusetts district court was\n21 confronted with a policy of strip/vbc searching prisoners who have received visitors to ensure,\n22 among other things, that no contraband is introduced into the facility.  Inmates challenged the\n23 strip searches, which were often conducted in the presence of other inmates who also were being\n24\n25 3Defendants explain that the point of entry for any inmate transported to the Lerdo Minimum facility for\nhousing for the first time or after attending court is a room known as โGate 1.โ  Declaration of Ian Silva in Support\n26 of Defendantsโ Joint Motion for Summary Adjudication (โSilva Dec.โ) ยถ 12; Doc. 39.  Defendants report that, from\nMarch 2005 through October 2007, no more than about 20 to 25 inmates were searched at one time at Gate 1.  Silva\n27 Dec. ยถ 12.  From March 2005 through October 2007, when inmates were returned to their housing assignment at the\npretrial facility no more than about 10 to 15 inmates were searched at one time.  Silva Dec. ยถ 13.  From March 2005\n28 through October 2007, when inmates were returned to their housing assignment at the Max-Med facility generally no\nmore than about 5 to 7 inmates were searched at one time.  Silva Dec. ยถ 14. \n10\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 91      Filed 03/31/2009     Page 11 of 32\n1 searched.  After determining that reasonable post-visit strip searches were constitutional, the\n2 court then considered whether conducting searches in the vicinity of other inmates who also were\n3 being searched rendered the practice unconstitutional.  Fernandez, 926 F.Supp. at 261.  In\n4 analyzing the group searches, the court employed the Bell test and concluded that โthe fact that\n5 plaintiffs were often searched in the presence of other inmates being searched does not render the\n6 searches unreasonable.โ  Id. at 262.  The court noted that the searches were performed by\n7 correction officers of the same sex, out of the view of visitors and/or other staff, and there were\n8 no allegations of physical abuse or touching by the officers.  Id.  In addition, the court observed\n9 that inmates shared cells, showered together and were observed throughout the day by fellow\n10 inmates and male and female correction officers while dressing, bathing or even defecating.  Id. \n11 The court supported its conclusion that the group searches were not unreasonable by recognizing\n12 that it was the policy and practice at the institution for an officer to comply with an inmateโs\n13 request to be searched alone.  Id.     \n14 Although Fernandez employed the Bell test, it is distinguishable from the instant matter. \n15 In Fernandez, it was the policy and practice for an officer to comply with an inmateโs request to\n16 be searched alone.  Here, there is no evidence of such a policy and/or practice.\n17 In Zunker v. Bertrand, the Wisconsin district court considered a correctional institution\n18 policy of strip searching all inmates leaving the visiting areas.  The policy was adopted in\n19 response to concerns that money and drugs were being brought into the institution during\n20 visitation.  After concluding that the constitutionality of visual body cavity searches conducted\n21 pursuant to security concerns had been established, the court considered whether the manner in\n22 which the searches were conducted, i.e., within the view of other inmates, was unreasonable. \n23 798 F.Supp. at 1369.  In Zunker, the defendant believed that booths in a shake down room, where\n24 the searches primarily were conducted, provided privacy because the officer stood in front of the\n25 inmate during the strip search and obstructed the view of inmates waiting to be searched.  Id. at\n26 1367-68.  The defendant initially did not install privacy curtains because of a belief that they\n27 would impede the officerโs view and allow inmates to hide contraband.  Id. at 1369-70.  The\n28 court determined that defendant took additional steps to try to protect the privacy of inmates who\n11\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 91      Filed 03/31/2009     Page 12 of 32\n1 were subjected to strip searches.  Id. at 1369.  That the defendant later decided to provide inmates\n2 with the privacy curtains did not render the initial decision or the initial searches unreasonable. \n3 Id. at 1370.  The court concluded that the privacy interest in not having other inmates view the\n4 strip searches did not outweigh the security interests of the prison.  Id.    \n5 Zunker is readily distinguishable.4  In Zunker, the searches at issue were conducted in\n6 booths and inmates were blocked from the view of other inmates by the officer conducting the\n7 search.  Here, however, there is no evidence of booths or any other efforts undertaken to protect\n8 privacy rights.  As the Zunker court acknowledged, โit is preferable to conduct strip searches in a\n9 way that protects the privacy of the inmates as much as possible.โ  Zunker, 798 F.Supp. at 1370.  \n10 Defendants next argue that the Ninth Circuit has rejected the argument that strip searches\n11 must be conducted in a private place outside of view of other inmates.  Defendants cite\n12 Thompson v. Souza, 111 F.3d 694, 699 (9th Cir. 1997) and Michenfelder, supra., 860 F.2d at\n13 333-34, to support their argument.  Plaintiffs counter that it is incorrect to suggest that Ninth\n14 Circuit precedent permits group strip searching.  Plaintiffs distinguish Thompson and\n15 Michenfelder as not addressing group strip searches. \n16 In Thompson, prison officials developed a plan to detect illicit drugs in the prison.  The\n17 plan called for prison staff to remove pre-selected inmates, and their cellmates, from their cells,\n18 while the cells were searched for drugs and urine samples were collected.  The inmates were\n19 chosen because of their prior involvement with illicit drugs.  Prison officials subjected 129 of\n20 3,400 inmates to the plan.  Strip searches were not discussed in the search plan.  In carrying out\n21 the plan, guards removed inmate Thompson and his cellmate from their cell and visually\n22 inspected their genitals and rectal areas as part of a strip search.  The search took place within\n23 view of other prisoners on the tier outside their cell.  Thompson, 111 F.3d at 697.  \n24\n25\n26\n4Insofar as Plaintiffs seek to further distinguish Fernandez and Zunker because the matters involved\n27 convicted inmates and not pretrial detainees, there is no indication that the searches were imposed as punishment and\nBell recognized no distinction between pretrial detainees and convicted inmates regarding regulations governing\n28 prison security.  See Bell, 441 U.S. at 546-47 & n. 28.  \n12\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 91      Filed 03/31/2009     Page 13 of 32\n1 Inmate Thompson argued in part that the strip searches should have been conducted in a\n2 more private location, out of view of the other prisoners.  The court rejected this argument,\n3 indicating that it would not question the prison officialsโ judgment that the conditions required\n4 searches outside the prisonersโ cells in order to protect the safety of the officers conducting them. \n5 Id. at 701.  In addition, the court determined that having the searches in an entirely separate area\n6 would potentially allow prisoners to discard contraband on the way to the separate area.  Id.  The\n7 court found that Thompson failed to meet his burden of showing that the strip search violated a\n8 clearly established right protected by the Fourth Amendment.  Id. \n9 In Michenfelder, the Ninth Circuit considered the strip search policy at the Nevada State\n10 Prisonโs Unit 7, the maximum security unit for the stateโs 40 most dangerous prisoners. \n11 Strip/vbc searches were conducted every time a Unit 7 inmate left or returned to the unit.  The\n12 searches occurred at the end of the hallway, visible to other prisoners whose cell doors opened\n13 onto the corridor and visible to some officers.  The prisoner in Michenfelder argued that strip\n14 searches should be conducted within the privacy of prisonersโ cells rather than out in the hallway. \n15 Although the Ninth Circuit stated that the prisonerโs argument was not meritless, the court went\n16 on to conclude that the unitโs layout presented only two alternative locationsโthe hallway or the\n17 prisonerโs cellโand it would not question the prisonโs judgment that conditions in the unit\n18 reasonably required searches outside the prisonersโ cells to protect the safety of officers\n19 conducting them.  Michenfelder, 860 F.2d at 333.  However, the court did โencourage [the\n20 prison] to opt for less public searches when security considerations allow[ed].โ Id. \n21 Thompson and Michenfelder involve unique circumstances.  In Thompson, the court\n22 confronted a plan to detect contraband targeted to specific inmates, not a blanket policy\n23 permitting group strip searches.  Similarly, the policy in Michenfelder limited searches to the\n24 stateโs most dangerous prisoners, which were housed in the maximum security unit, not a blanket\n25 strip search policy.  Further, when considering the visible nature of the strip searches, the\n26 Michenfelder court focused its analysis on officer safety and the lack of available alternatives. \n27 860 F.2d at 333.  Nonetheless, the court encouraged less public searches when security\n28 considerations allowed.  \n13\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 91      Filed 03/31/2009     Page 14 of 32\n1 Although Defendants have made general assertions regarding limited space and limited\n2 staffing as precluding individualized searches, Defendants made no apparent efforts to conduct\n3 individualized searches or to preserve the privacy of the individuals during searches. \n4 Michenfelder, 860 F.2d at 333 (encouraging prison to opt for less public searches when security\n5 considerations allow); Craft v. County of San Bernardino, 468 F.Supp.2d 1172, 1176 (C.D.Cal.\n6 2006) (factor regarding manner of searches strongly favored inmates where searches were\n7 conducted โen masse without any attempt to limit the humiliation occasioned by conducting the\n8 searches in full view of dozens of other individualsโ).  Defendantsโ arguments regarding lack of\n9 adequate resources and limited space fall within the category of administrative burden and\n10 inconvenience.  Plaintiffs properly discount these arguments as not providing a basis to permit\n11 constitutional violations.  Cf. Craft, 468 F.Supp.2d at 1178 (lack of funds does not justify a\n12 constitutional violation); Stone v. City and County of San Francisco, 968 F.2d 850, 858\n13 (financial constraints do not allow states to deprive persons of their constitutional rights). \n14 Defendants proffered no evidence of lack of available alternatives or the preclusion of officer\n15 safety, and, while not determinative, the subsequent policy change belies any assertion that there\n16 were a lack of alternatives or that safety considerations would not permit individualized searches. \n17 Defendantsโ additional arguments regarding security concerns relate to the justification\n18 for the searches at issue.  As the Supreme Court recognized in Bell, \n19 maintaining institutional security and preserving internal order and discipline are\nessential goals that may require limitation or retraction of the retained\n20 constitutional rights of convicted prisoners and pretrial detainees. Central to all\nother corrections goals is the institutional consideration of internal security within\n21 the corrections facilities themselves. \n22 Bell, 441 U.S. at 546-47 (citations and internal quotations omitted).  Accordingly, โwhen an\n23 institutional restriction infringes on a specific constitutional guarantee ... the practice must be\n24 evaluated in the light of the central objective of prison administration, safeguarding institutional\n25 security.โ  Id. at 547.   \n26 To demonstrate โlegitimate, identifiable security reasons,โ Defendants contend that the\n27 โfacts clearly establish that in the last five years, approximately 1,900 inmates in KCSO custody\n28 have been found guilty of having some type of prohibited contraband.โ (Defs.โ Mem. Supp.\n14\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 91      Filed 03/31/2009     Page 15 of 32\n1 Summ. Adj. 9; Silva Dec. ยถ 19).  Since September 2007, KCSO discovered contraband possessed\n2 by 22 inmates as a result of strip searches.  (Defs.โ Mem. Supp. Summ. Adj. 9; Silva Dec. ยถ 19). \n3 Defendantsโ asserted justification for the policyโthe prevention of contraband being introduced\n4 into the jailโis โan extremely weighty government interest.โ  Thompson v. City of Los Angeles,\n5 885 F.2d 1439, 1446 (9th Cir. 1989) (prevention of the introduction of weapons or other\n6 contraband); Way, 445 F.3d at 1161 (recognizing the difficulty of operating a detention facility\n7 safely, the seriousness of the risk of smuggled weapons and contraband, and the deference owed\n8 to jail officials' exercise of judgment in adopting and executing policies necessary to maintain\n9 institutional security); Michenfelder, 860 F.2d at 332 (acknowledging โ[v]isual body cavity\n10 searches conducted after contact visits as a means of preventing prisoners' possession of weapons\n11 and contraband, even absent probable cause, have been found reasonable by the Supreme Courtโ) \n12 (citing Bell, 441 U.S. at 558-60, 99 S.Ct. at 1884-85).  \n13 However, the evidence presented by Defendantsโ declaration does not reveal whether the\n14 contraband discoveries were made pursuant to the group strip searches at issue or whether they\n15 were the result of searches conducted based on a tip, reasonable suspicion or cell search.  See,\n16 e.g., Way, 445 F.3d at 1161 (requiring link between blanket strip search policy and legitimate\n17 security concerns); Giles, 746 F.2d at 618 (requiring demonstration that security interests\n18 warranted the serious invasion of privacy inflicted by strip searching of arrestee and concluding\n19 the evidence of smuggling activity was minimal), overruled on other grounds by Hodgers-Durgin\n20 v. de la Vina, 199 F.3d 1037, 1040 n.1 (9th Cir. 1999); Craft, 468 F.Supp.2d at 1178 (โevidence\n21 does not reveal whether [contraband] discoveries were made pursuant to a search of a\n22 pre-arraignment transferee (such as the ones at issue in the present case), to say nothing of the\n23 fact that defendants make no attempt to demonstrate that any particular pre-arraignment\n24 transferee had been identified as likely or potentially likely to smuggle contraband in a manner\n25 likely to be detected by a strip and/or visual body search).  Defendants have not provided\n26 evidence suggesting that group strip searches (versus individualized searches) increase the\n27 likelihood of contraband finds.  Insofar as Defendants have provided examples of specific\n28 inmates who were found with contraband when strip searched, these examples are not\n15\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 91      Filed 03/31/2009     Page 16 of 32\n1 instructive.5  The policy of strip searching individuals for purposes of discovering contraband is\n2 not being challenged.  The issue is group strip searches.  Defendants have provided no evidence\n3 to suggest that the contraband was more likely to be found during a group strip search than a\n4 search which afforded the individual being searched some privacy.\n5 Defendants fault Plaintiffs for their failure to cite Powell v. Barrett, 541 F.3d 1298 (11th\n6 Cir. 2008) in which the Eleventh Circuit, en banc, concluded that a policy or practice of strip\n7 searching all arrestees at the time of booking was constitutionally permissible.  The Powell\n8 decision is of no precedential value in this circuit and it is unpersuasive.  In addition, although\n9 the Powell court was willing to uphold searches so long as they were no more intrusive than the\n10 visual body cavity searches in Bell, the strip search at issue in Powell did not include a visual\n11 body cavity search.  Instead, the search occurred immediately after each plaintiff had taken a\n12 group shower with other incoming detainees of the same sex and before they put on their jail\n13 jumpsuits.  The strip searches consisted of one or more guards viewing the front and back sides\n14 of the plaintiffsโ naked bodies.  The exposure of flesh was no greater than what occurred in the\n15 shower.  Id. at 1313 n. 6.  The Powell court did not think it was open to โserious dispute that\n16 inmates of the same sex may be required to shower together and that guards of that sex may\n17 watch them while they are showering to prevent any misconduct.โ Id. (internal citations omitted). \n18 The court concluded that it โnecessarily follows that [a] visual strip search is not\n19 unconstitutional.โ Id.  In the instant case, however, a visual body cavity is not the apparent\n20 equivalent to viewing a detainee in the shower.\n21  Under the guidance of Michenfelder, which encouraged less public searches when\n22 security considerations allow, the Court finds that the blanket policy of strip searching detainees\n23 in groups violates the Fourth Amendment.  Accordingly, Plaintiffsโ motion for summary\n24\n25 5The Declaration of Ian Silva provides: โIn a widely publicized incident in 2007, convicted mass-murderer\nVincent Brothers managed to secret a fabricated handcuff key in his hair during a visit to court. This key was\n26 discovered during a strip search of his person....In another incident, murder suspect Andrew Hernandez was strip\nsearched prior to a court appointment in May of 2007.  A razor blade was discovered in his shoe. In May of 2008,\n27 after strip searches had been restricted by Sheriffโs Office policy, Hernandez was transported to a hospital without\nbeing strip searched. He produced a stolen handcuff key, removed his restraints, and fled.  He was recaptured by\n28 Deputies, but not before he broke into an occupied apartment in an attempt to evade the pursuit.โ  Silva Dec. ยถยถ 17-\n18.\n16\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 91      Filed 03/31/2009     Page 17 of 32\n1 adjudication limited to KCSOโs policy of group strip searching prisoners in violation of the\n2 Fourth Amendment is GRANTED.  Defendantsโ motion for summary adjudication as to this\n3 claim is DENIED.\n4 Court Returnees Ordered Released\n5 As to the prisoners ordered released, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants cannot justify their\n6 former policy of subjecting all prisoners who have been ordered released to a strip search. \n7 Defendants contend it is well established that where exposure to the general public presents a\n8 very real danger of contraband being passed to a detainee, a policy of strip searching the\n9 detainees upon their return from the courthouse and prior to their being placed back in the\n10 general population of the detention center is both justified and reasonable.  \n11 Defendants cite Richerson v. Lexington Fayette Urban County Govt., 958 F.Supp. 299,\n12 307 (E.D. Ky. 1996) to support strip searching of a post-arraignment, pre-trial detainee returning\n13 from court to general population.  Defendantsโ reliance on Richerson overlooks a key distinction. \n14 Richerson addressed a policy regarding strip searching a detainee returned to the general\n15 population following his arraignment, not a detainee who is ordered released, but subsequently\n16 returned to the general population for administrative reasons pending actual release.  Richerson,\n17 958 F.Supp. at 306 n. 4.  Defendants provide no authority to support the propriety of strip\n18 searching detainees who have been ordered released.      \n19 In justification of the policy of searching court returnees who have been ordered released,\n20 Defendants argue that neither the corrections officers escorting the detainees to and from the\n21 courthouse nor the officers stationed in the jail facility know whether a detainee has been ordered\n22 released at the time the detainee returns to the jail.  Defendants assert that when the court issues\n23 an order of release, the clerk of the court enters the courtโs order into the local computerized\n24 Criminal Justice Information System (โCJISโ).  Defendants further assert that due to the time\n25 delay between the return from court and the entry of release orders, there is no way for custodial\n26 staff to know which of the inmates are going to be released following their court appearances\n27 and, hence, inmates returning from court must be re-housed in the jail until further information is\n28 received later in the day regarding their release.  In support of this argument, Defendants provide\n17\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 91      Filed 03/31/2009     Page 18 of 32\n1 only the conclusory declaration of Ian Silva, stating that the clerk may enter the order at any time\n2 before the end of the clerkโs work day and, almost always, the inmate has returned to the Lerdo\n3 facility before the clerk has entered the order in CJIS.  (Declaration of Ian Silva in Support of\n4 Defendantsโ Joint Motion for Summary Adjudication Regarding Court Returnees, Qualified\n5 Immunity and Eleventh Amendment Immunity (โSecond Silva Dec.โ) ยถยถ 5-9; Doc. 66). \n6 Defendants provide no evidence to support the assertions as to the Superior Courtโs practice, the\n7 actual timing of release orders or, more importantly, evidence to suggest Defendants make any\n8 effort to determine whether a detainee has been ordered released before the detainee is strip\n9 searched and returned to the general population.  Additionally, Defendants offer no evidence to\n10 suggest that the percentage of persons ordered released is high or that there is no means to\n11 identify or segregate them from other court returnees to prevent their return to the general\n12 population.  As the Craft court reasoned:\n13 As to the court returnees entitled to release, although defendants conduct the searches\nin order to maintain institutional security, they create the security concerns they seek\n14 to address by failing to segregate individuals entitled to release from those who are\nand/or who will be returned to the general population.  This category of plaintiffs are,\n15 by definition, those who became entitled to release as a result of their court\nappearances.  A blanket policy of subjecting these individuals to strip and/or visual\n16 body cavity searches cannot be reconciled with the Fourth Amendment.  Cf. Ward v.\nSan Diego County, 791 F.2d 1329, 1333 (9th Cir. 1986) (โIn most instances the\n17 unreasonableness of a strip search conducted prior to an [own recognizance] release\ndetermination is plain.โ), cert. denied sub nom., 483 U.S. 1020, 107 S.Ct. 3263, 97\n18 L.ED.2d 762 (1987).  \n19 Craft, 468 F.Supp.2d at 1179.  That Craft may have been limited to arrestees entitled to release as\n20 opposed to detainees entitled to release is distinction without a difference here as both the\n21 arrestees and the detainees are entitled to release as a result of court appearances. \n22 Accordingly, Plaintiffsโ motion for summary adjudication limited to KCSOโs policy of\n23 strip searching persons ordered released from custody in violation of the Fourth Amendment is\n24 GRANTED. \n25 Defendants contend that the County of Kern cannot be liable for any violation of the\n26 constitutional rights fo detainees ordered released  because it is the Superior Courtโs policy\n27 procedure which prevents jail staff from being able to determine the inmatesโ status upon return\n28 to the jail rather than Countyโs.  This argument is simply without merit or factual support. \n18\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 91      Filed 03/31/2009     Page 19 of 32\n1 Generally, a claim against a local government unit for municipal or county liability requires an\n2 allegation that โa deliberate policy, custom, or practice . . . was the โmoving forceโ behind the\n3 constitutional violation . . . suffered.โ  Galen v. County of Los Angeles, 477 F.3d 652, 667 (9th\n4 Cir. 2007); City of Canton, Ohio, v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 385 (1989).  Contrary to Defendantsโ\n5 assertion, it is not the Superior Courtโs policy, but rather the jail policy and practice of strip\n6 searching persons ordered released and returning to them to general population.  The County of\n7 Kern is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law and Defendantsโ summary adjudication\n8 motion regarding the court-returnee class is DENIED. \n9 2. Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\n10 In Count One of the FAC, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated their rights under the\n11 Fourteenth Amendment to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.  FAC, at ยถ 46. \n12 Defendants argue that the group searches at issue do not violate Plaintiffsโ rights under the Due\n13 Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and seek summary adjudication. \n14 In evaluating the constitutionality of conditions or restrictions of pretrial detention which\n15 implicate only the deprivation of liberty without due process of law, the United States Supreme\n16 Court has indicated that the proper inquiry is whether the conditions amount to punishment of the\n17 detainee.  Bell, 441 U.S. at 535-37.  A court must decide whether the disability is imposed for the\n18 purpose of punishment or whether it is but an incident of some other legitimate governmental\n19 purpose.  Bell, 441 U.S. at 538.  Plaintiffs did not expressly oppose Defendantsโ due process\n20 arguments and count one of the FAC does not expressly allege a due process violation premised\n21 on the Fourteenth Amendment.  As Defendants contend, however, there are no facts to suggest\n22 that any of the Plaintiffs were strip searched as a means for punishment.  Plaintiffs have failed to\n23 demonstrate that the practice of searching inmates in small groups violates due process rights\n24 under the Fourteenth Amendment.  Accordingly, to the extent that Plaintiffs have alleged a\n25 Fourteenth Amendment due process violation regarding group strip searches, Defendantsโ motion\n26 for summary adjudication as to this claim is GRANTED.\n27 ///\n28 ///\n19\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 91      Filed 03/31/2009     Page 20 of 32\n1 3. Equal Protection of the Fourteenth Amendment\n2 In Count Two, Plaintiffs allege that the strip and/or vbc searches โdeprived plaintiffs and\n3 class members of the protections afforded by provisions of the 14th Amendment Equal Protection\n4 guarantees.โ  FAC, at ยถ 47.  Defendants seek summary adjudication on Plaintiffsโ equal\n5 protection claim.    \n6 The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment commands that no state shall\n7 deny any person equal protection of the laws.  City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, 473\n8 U.S. 432, 439 (1985).  Thus, all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.  Id.; Plyler v.\n9 Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 216 (1982).  Dissimilar treatment of dissimilarly situated persons does not\n10 violate Equal Protection. See Keevan v. Smith, 100 F.3d 644, 648 (8th Cir. 1996) (treatment of\n11 dissimilarly situated persons in a dissimilar manner does not violate the Equal Protection\n12 Clause); Barket, Levy & Fine, Inc. v. St. Louis Thermal Energy Corp., 21 F.3d 237, 242 (8th Cir.\n13 1994).  \n14 Plaintiffs challenge the unequal practice of providing privacy for pre-arraignment strip\n15 searches, but not other strip searches conducted by Defendants.  Plaintiffs have offered no\n16 authority to support their contention that pre-arraignment arrestees and post-arraignment persons\n17 are similarly situated.  Plaintiffsโ attempt to equate the two by arguing that a personโs interest in\n18 maintaining the privacy of his or her body cavities is the same for both arrestees and pre-trial\n19 detainees is unpersuasive.  The Court agrees with Defendants that, in this context, pre-\n20 arraignment arrestees are not similarly situated to post-arraignment detainees.  Compare Giles,\n21 746 F.2d at 615 (โarrestees for minor offenses may be subjected to a strip search only if jail\n22 officials have a reasonable suspicion that the particular arrestee is carrying or concealing\n23 contraband or suffering from a communicable diseaseโ), with Bell, 441 U.S. at 546-47 & n. 28\n24 (finding no basis to conclude that pretrial detainees pose any lesser security risk than convicted\n25 inmates and applying constitutional rights enjoyed by convicted prisoners to pretrial detainees;\n26 determining visual body cavity searches following contact visits did not violate Fourth\n27 Amendment and could be conducted on less than probable cause). \n28\n20\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 91      Filed 03/31/2009     Page 21 of 32\n1 Insofar as Plaintiffs fault Defendants for not applying California Penal Code section\n2 4030(m) to post-arraignment detainees in their Equal Protection claim, their argument is without\n3 merit.  California Penal Code ยง 4030 applies โonly to pre-arraignment detainees arrested for\n4 infraction or misdemeanor offenses.โ  Cal. Pen. Code ยง 4030 (b).  Subsection (m) requires all\n5 strip, visual and physical body cavity searches of pre-arraignment detainees to โbe conducted in\n6 an area of privacy so that the search cannot be observed by persons not participating in the\n7 search.โ  Cal. Pen. Code ยง 4030(m).  Plaintiffs do not contend that Defendants violated section\n8 4030.  (Plaintiffsโ Opp. to Defs.โ Mot. Summ. Adj. 16-17 (โSince the County already conducts all\n9 pre-arraignment strip searches in private...the focus of this motion is group post-arraignment strip\n10 searches....).  Plaintiffs essentially argue that Defendants should have extended the protections of\n11 section 4030 to all detainees.  However, by its terms, section 4030 is limited to pre-arraignment\n12 detainees arrested on infraction or misdemeanor offenses.  \n13 Based on the above, Defendantsโ motion for summary adjudication as to Plaintiffsโ Equal\n14 Protection Clause claim as to persons alleging group strip searches is GRANTED.   \n15 4. State Law Claims\n16 a. Right to Privacy Claim\n17 Plaintiffs argue that the group strip search policy violated their right to privacy\n18 guaranteed by Cal. Const. Art. 1, ยง 1. See Cal. Const. Art. I, ยง 1 (โAll people are by nature free\n19 and independent and have inalienable rights. Among these are enjoying and defending life and\n20 liberty, acquiring, possessing, and protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining safety,\n21 happiness, and privacy.โ).  Plaintiffs complaint does not include a separate cause of action for\n22 violation of section 1, but Plaintiffs have filed a motion to amend their complaint to allege a\n23 separate cause of action.  Concurrently with this order, Plaintiffs have been granted leave to file\n24 a second amended complaint alleging a section 1 cause of action and the parties arguments in\n25 connection with the section 1 claim are addressed.     \n26 Several courts have indicated that in the search and seizure context, the Article I, ยง 1\n27 privacy clause of the California Constitution has not been held to establish a broader protection\n28 than that provided by the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  See, e.g., Quon\n21\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 91      Filed 03/31/2009     Page 22 of 32\n1 v. Arch Wireless Operating Co., Inc., 529 F.3d 892, 903 (9th Cir. 2008) (the privacy protected\n2 by Article I, Section 1 of the California Constitution is no broader in the area of search and\n3 seizure than the privacy protected by the Fourth Amendment) (quoting Hill v. Natโl Collegiate\n4 Ath. Assโn, 7 Cal.4th 1, 30 n.9 (1994)), rehโg denied, 554 F.3d 769 (2009); Sanchez v. County\n5 of San Diego, 464 F.3d 916, 943 (9th Cir. 2006) (in search and seizure context, the Article I,\n6 Section 1, privacy clause of the California Constitution has never been held to establish a\n7 broader protection than that provided by the Fourth Amendment), rehโg denied, 483 F.3d 965\n8 (9th Cir. 2007), cert. denied, 128 S.Ct. 649 (2007).  Accordingly, the discussion of Plaintiffsโ\n9 federal constitutional claim resolves both the federal and state constitutional privacy claims. \n10 Plaintiffsโ motion for summary adjudication regarding this claim is GRANTED.\n11   b.  California Constitution ยง 7 and ยง 13\n12 In Count Three, Plaintiffs claim that the strip and/or visual body cavity searches violated\n13 California Constitution, Art. 1, ยง 7 (equal protection) and ยง 13 (unreasonable search and\n14 seizure).  FAC, at ยถ 48.  Plaintiffs seek summary judgment regarding these claims.  Defendants\n15 argue that there is no private cause of action for damages for an alleged violation of ยง 13.  \n16 Plaintiffs may not bring damages claims directly under Article I, Section 13 or Section 7.\n17 See Brown v. County of Kern, 2008 WL 544565, *17 (E.D.Cal. February 26, 2008) (plaintiff in\n18 an excessive force case could not bring a damages claim directly under Article 1, Sections 7 or\n19 13 of the California Constitution in part because alternative statutory and/or common law causes\n20 of action were available).  As Plaintiffs cannot assert an independent cause of action for\n21 violation of sections 7 and 13, Plaintiffs are not entitled to summary judgment as to their third\n22 cause of action.  \n23 c. California Civil Code ยง 52.1(b)\n24 As to the group strip searches, Defendants seek summary adjudication regarding\n25 Plaintiffsโ claims for damages in count four pursuant to California Civil Code ยง 52.1(b).  FAC,\n26 at ยถ 50.  California Civil Code  ยง 52.1(b) authorizes a civil cause of action by an individual\n27 whose federal or state constitutional rights are interfered with in a manner prohibited by Cal.\n28 Civ. Code ยง 52.1(a).  Section 52.1(a), in turn, prohibits โthreats, intimidation, or coercion, or\n22\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 91      Filed 03/31/2009     Page 23 of 32\n1 attempts to interfere by threats, intimidation, or coercion, with the exercise or enjoyment by any\n2 individual or individuals of rightsโ guaranteed by the United States and California\n3 Constitutions.  Plaintiffs base their ยง 52.1(b) claim, in part, on violations of the Fourth, Eighth\n4 and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article I, ยง ยง 1, 7, 13 and 17\n5 of the California Constitution.  FAC, at ยถ 50.\n6 In their motion for summary adjudication, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs cannot\n7 demonstrate an underlying violation of state or federal law in order to prevail on their claims for\n8 violation of California Civil Code section 52.1.  (Defs.โ Mem. Supp. Summ. Adj. 16; Doc. 37). \n9 Plaintiffs did not respond expressly to Defendantsโ contention in their opposition.  (Doc. 54). \n10 Plaintiffs also did not seek partial summary judgment regarding their claim for damages\n11 pursuant to California Civil Code ยง 52.1(b).  (Doc. 69).  Although Plaintiffsโ cross-motion seeks\n12 partial summary judgment regarding their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment claims and their\n13 California Constitutional claims under Article I, ยง ยง 1, 7 and 13, there is no discussion of\n14 California Civil Code section 52.1.  As indicated throughout this order, however, Plaintiffs have\n15 demonstrated underlying violation(s) of state and/or federal law.  As Defendants premised their\n16 section 52.1 arguments on the ground that Plaintiffs could not demonstrate an underlying\n17 constitutional violation, neither party has fully briefed their arguments regarding California\n18 Civil Code section 52.1.  Accordingly, Defendantsโ motion for summary adjudication regarding\n19 Plaintiffsโ state law claims is DENIED without prejudice.\n20 5. Qualified Immunity\n21 Defendants contend that the individual defendants, Youngblood and Wimbish, are\n22 entitled to qualified immunity as to Plaintiffsโ constitutional claims.  โQualified immunity is โan\n23 entitlement not to stand trial or face the other burdens of litigation.โโ Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S.\n24 194, 200 (2001) (quoting Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526 (1985)).  The Court evaluates a\n25 defendant's qualified immunity defense using a two-step inquiry.  Id.  However, the Supreme\n26 Court recently held that this two-step inquiry is no longer an inflexible requirement.  Pearson v.\n27 Callahan, --- U.S. ----, ----, 129 S.Ct. 808, 818, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009) (explaining โthat, while\n28 the sequence set forth [in Saucier] is often appropriate, it should no longer be regarded as\n23\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 91      Filed 03/31/2009     Page 24 of 32\n1 mandatoryโ).  It is within our โsound discretion in deciding which of the two prongs of the\n2 qualified immunity analysis should be addressed first in light of the circumstances in the\n3 particular case at hand.โ Id.\n4 Under Saucier's first prong, the court must determine whether, viewing the facts in the\n5 light most favorable to the plaintiff, the government employees violated the plaintiff's\n6 constitutional rights.  Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201.  If the court determines that a constitutional\n7 violation has occurred, under Saucierโs second prong, it must determine whether the rights were\n8 clearly established at the time of the violation. Id.  For a right to be clearly established, its\n9 contours โ โmust be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is\n10 doing violates the right.โ โ Id. at 202 (quoting Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640\n11 (1987)).  The protection afforded by qualified immunity โsafeguards โall but the plainly\n12 incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.โโ Brewster v. Bd. of Educ. of the\n13 Lynwood Unified Sch. Dist., 149 F.3d 971, 977 (9th Cir.1998) (quoting Malley v. Briggs, 475\n14 U.S. 335, 341 (1986)).\n15 a. Group Searches\n16 Fourth Amendment Claims\n17 Defendants argue that Defendants Youngblood and Wimbish are entitled to qualified\n18 immunity regarding the Fourth Amendment claims specific to group searches because there is\n19 no clearly established case law. \n20 At a minimum, it is established that the Fourth Amendment protects prisoners from\n21 unreasonable searches and seizures.  Michenfelder, 860 F.2d at 332 (strip searches that are\n22 excessive, vindictive, harassing, or unrelated to any legitimate penological interest are not\n23 reasonable).  It is also clear that prisoners retain a limited right to bodily privacy.  Michenfelder,\n24 860 F.2d at 333.  However, under the second prong of Saucier, the inquiry is more\n25 particularized.  The issue before the Court is whether the contours of the limited right to privacy\n26 and the protection against unreasonable searches were sufficiently clear such that the individual\n27 defendants could believe that group strip searches violated the Fourth Amendment rights of\n28 post-arraignment detainees. \n24\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 91      Filed 03/31/2009     Page 25 of 32\n1 Plaintiffs contend that the law has been clearly established for many years prior to 2006\n2 that absent some compelling reason the prisoner must be afforded privacy.  Plaintiffs direct the\n3 court to  Amaechi v. West, 237 F.3d 356, 364 (4th Cir. 2001), Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007,\n4 1014 (4th Cir. 1981) and Iskander v. Village of Forest Park, 690 F.2d 126, 129 (7th Cir. 1982)\n5 in support of their contentions.  In Amaechi, the plaintiff was not searched in a private holding\n6 cell, but rather on the street in front of the plaintiffโs home, subject to viewing by her family, the\n7 public, and the other officers.  Id. at 361-362.  In disavowing the public search at issue, the\n8 Fourth Circuit noted that it had โrepeatedly emphasized the necessity of conducting a strip\n9 search in private.โ  Id. at 364.\n10 In Logan, the Fourth Circuit considered a strip search of a female arrested on a DWI\n11 charge.  A magistrate judge directed she be held for four hours or until a person took custody of\n12 her.  She was taken to a holding cell and a visual strip search was conducted.  There was a\n13 factual dispute over whether the window blinds in the holding cell were either open or broken\n14 and permitted anyone in the booking area to observe the strip search.  Id. at 1010.  In\n15 considering the issue of qualified immunity, the court reasoned:\n16\nWe think that, as a matter of law, no police officer in this day and time could\nreasonably believe that conducting a strip search in an area exposed to the\n17\ngeneral view of persons known to be in the vicinity whether or not any actually\nviewed the search is a constitutionally valid governmental โinvasion of (the)\n18\npersonal rights that (such a) search entails.โ \n19\nId. at 1014 (citation omitted).  \n20\nIn Iskander, the court ruled that evidence regarding a strip search of the plaintiff\n21\nwarranted submission to the jury.  With regard to the strip search claim, the plaintiff presented\n22\nevidence that the police department customarily conducted strip searches in a room with a\n23\nwindow facing a corridor through which numerous individuals might be passing at any given\n24\ntime.  In discussing the strip search claim, the Seventh Circuit indicated that โDefendant\n25\nnaturally does not maintain that routine strip searches may be conducted in a room open to the\n26\nprying eyes of passing strangers consistent with the reasonableness requirement imposed on all\n27\nsearches under the Fourth Amendment, nor would such a contention be entertained.โ  Iskander,\n28\n690 F.2d at 129.\n25\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 91      Filed 03/31/2009     Page 26 of 32\n1 Plaintiffsโ citations are not instructive as they addressed searches conducted in potential\n2 view of the public.  Plaintiffs have not identified cases that specifically proscribed the use of\n3 group strip searches of post-arraignment detainees.  Based the previous discussion regarding the\n4 Fourth Amendment, the Court finds that at the time of the policies at issue, the law was not\n5 clearly established that group strip searches of post-arraignment detainees were unconstitutional. \n6 See, e.g., Bell, 441 U.S. at 558 (visual body cavity searches of pre-trial detainees conducted\n7 after every contact visit with a person from outside the institution did not violate Fourth\n8 Amendment; court did not consider blanket policy of group strip searching detainees);\n9 Thompson, 111 F.3d at 701 (upholding searches outside of prisonersโ cells within view of other\n10 inmates; court did not consider generalized strip search policy permitting group searches of\n11 detainees); Michenfelder, 860 F.2d at 333 (upholding strip searches of prisoners conducted at\n12 end of hallway visible to other prisoners and some officers; court did not consider strip search\n13 policy permitting group strip searches of detainees); Craft, 468 F.Supp.2d at 1179 (policy of\n14 group strip searching arrestees returning from court entitled to release determined unreasonable;\n15 court did not expressly consider strip search policy permitting group strip searches of detainees).\n16 Defendantsโ motion for summary adjudication that Defendants Youngblood and\n17 Wimbish are entitled to qualified immunity regarding Plaintiffsโ Fourth Amendment claims\n18 specific to group strip searches is GRANTED.     \n19 Fourteenth Amendment and Equal Protection Claims\n20 It is not necessary to address Defendants arguments that qualified immunity should be\n21 applied to Plaintiffsโ Fourteenth Amendment and Equal Protection claims specific to the group\n22 searches, because there has been no determination of an underlying violation of the Fourteenth\n23 Amendment or an Equal Protection violation.  Accordingly, Defendantsโ motion for summary\n24 adjudication that Defendants Youngblood and Wimbish are entitled to qualified immunity\n25 regarding Plaintiffsโ Fourteenth Amendment and Equal Protection claims is GRANTED. \n26 b. Court Ordered Releases\n27 Defendants argue that individual defendants Youngblood and Wimbish should be\n28 granted qualified immunity regarding searches of detainees upon return from court appearances\n26\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 91      Filed 03/31/2009     Page 27 of 32\n1 after they were ordered released.  In support, Defendants contend that there is no clearly\n2 established case law that would have placed Youngblood and/or Wimbish on notice that this\n3 protocol was in any way unconstitutional.  Insofar as Defendants argue that there is no clearly\n4 established case law requiring a detention facility to know the status of detainees returning from\n5 court or requiring they be segregated and held indefinitely until their status is conclusively\n6 determined, this is not the appropriate inquiry.  Instead, the inquiry is whether the law at the\n7 time of the violation(s) was clearly established such that Defendants Youngblood and Wimbish\n8 would understand that strip searches of detainees ordered release were unconstitutional.    \n9 Plaintiffs argue that appellate decisions as early as 1981 have held that strip searching\n10 prisoners who have been ordered released violates the constitution.  Plaintiffs partially rely on \n11 Young v. City of Little Rock, 249 F.3d 730, 735-36 (8th Cir. 2001).  Young involved a female\n12 mistakenly arrested.  Although the arresting officer realized the mistake, the arrestee remained\n13 in jail during the weekend until she appeared in front of a judge on Monday.  During this\n14 detention, she was strip searched.  After appearing in court, the judge determined that the wrong\n15 person had been arrested and ordered her released.  Instead of being released, she was\n16 transported back to the county jail.  While there, she was again strip searched.  The strip search\n17 took place in front of five or six other people.  In reviewing the events after the ordered release,\n18 the appellate court reasoned, in part, that she could have been transported back to the jail\n19 without chaining and that โcertainly there was no necessity whatever to strip search a person\n20 who was wholly innocent of any charge.โ  Id. at 736.  The court characterized the โwhole\n21 incidentโ as โshocking.โ  Id.\n22 Unlike Young, there is no evidence regarding the innocence of the class of court\n23 returnees.  However, this factual distinction is not determinative.  During the time period at\n24 issue, the law was sufficiently clear that strip searches of persons entitled to release were\n25 unreasonable.  In Ward v. San Diego County, supra., the Ninth Circuit considered a policy of\n26 strip searching minor arrestees even before an own recognizance release determination was\n27 made and absent reasonable suspicion that the arrestee possessed a weapon or contraband. \n28 Ward, 791 F.2d at 1333, cert. denied, 483 U.S. 1020 (1987).  The court commented that the\n27\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 91      Filed 03/31/2009     Page 28 of 32\n1 facts before it suggested โthe easiest possible caseโ and reasoned that โ[i]n most instances the\n2 unreasonableness of a strip search conducted prior to an [own recognizance] release\n3 determination is plain.โ  Id.  Here, a court has issued an express determination that a detainee is\n4 entitled to release.  Following Ward, the facts presented here make plain the unreasonableness\n5 of strip searches conducted on court returnees.  Accordingly, Defendantsโ motion for summary\n6 adjudication that Defendants Youngblood and Wimbish are entitled to qualified immunity\n7 regarding the searches of detainees upon return from court appearances after they were ordered\n8 released is DENIED.\n9 3. Eleventh Amendment Immunity\n10 Defendants argue that Sheriff Donny Youngblood, in his official capacity, is a\n11 policymaker for the State of California and is immune from ยง 1983 liability pursuant to the\n12 Eleventh Amendment.  The Eleventh Amendment bars damages actions against state officials in\n13 their official capacity.  See Doe v. Lawrence Livermore Natโl Lab., 131 F.3d 836, 839 (9th Cir.\n14 1997); Eaglesmith v. Ward, 73 F.3d 857, 859 (9th Cir. 1996); Pena v. Gardner, 976 F.2d 469,\n15 472 (9th Cir. 1992).  \n16 Defendants rely on McMillian v. Monroe County, 520 U.S. 781 (1997) and Venegas v.\n17 County of Los Angeles, 32 Cal.4th 820 (2004) to support their contention that the Sheriff is an\n18 actor representing the state and cannot be sued under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.  In McMillian, the\n19 County was sued for allegedly unconstitutional actions undertaken by the Monroe County\n20 Sheriff.  The McMillian court indicated that in cases involving the liability of local governments\n21 under ยง 1983, the court must ask whether governmental officials are final policymakers for the\n22 local government in a particular area.  Id. at 785-86.  In deferring to state law in the context of\n23 section 1983, the Supreme Court closely examined the Alabama Constitution, Code and case\n24 law.  After so doing, the Court concluded that โAlabama sheriffs, when executing their law\n25 enforcement duties, represent the State of Alabama, not their counties.โ  Id. at 793.  The court\n26 affirmed dismissal of the claims against the county and the sheriffs in their official capacities\n27 because the sheriff was not the final policymaker for the county.  \n28\n28\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 91      Filed 03/31/2009     Page 29 of 32\n1 Defendants contend that, like Alabama, the California Constitution and state laws\n2 support the conclusion that the Sheriff is an actor representing the state.  Defendants further\n3 contend that examination of California law enforcement hierarchy reveals that California\n4 Sheriffs and District Attorneys are subject to the California Attorney General in regard to the\n5 official functions of their job in investigating and fighting crime and must be deemed state\n6 actors.  Defendants essentially argue that โthe Sheriff promulgates and maintains policies to\n7 ensure that violators of California law are held to answer the charges filed against them by the\n8 district attorney, who acts on behalf of the State, in the Superior Court, which is a division of\n9 the State.โ  (Defs.โ Mot. Sum. Adjud. Re: Court Returnees, Qualified Immunity and Eleventh\n10 Amendment Immunity 20-21 Defendantsโ Joint Motion for Summary Adjudication 15).   Per\n11 Defendants, the policy regarding strip searches was โestablished on behalf of the State of\n12 California to maintain prisonersโ safety while charges were pending against them or to\n13 incarcerate them on behalf of the State after they were convicted.โ  (Defs.โ Mot. Sum. Adjud.\n14 Re: Court Returnees, Qualified Immunity and Eleventh Amendment Immunity 16).  \n15 Plaintiffs counter that Defendants are judicially estopped from claiming they are โarms\n16 of the Stateโ based on the Ninth Circuitโs decision in Streit v. County of Los Angeles, 236 F.3d\n17 552, 565 (9th Cir. 2001).  Streit involved a policy whereby prisoners were not released until\n18 after all recent warrants and holds were checked.  In Streit, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the\n19 Sheriff acts for the County in its oversight and management of the local jail based on its\n20 independent analysis of Californiaโs constitution, statutes and case law.  Id. at 561.  The court\n21 observed that Article XI, section 1(b) of the California Constitution designates sheriffs as county\n22 officers and there was no provision in the constitution which states that the sheriffโs department\n23 acts for the state when managing the local jails.  The Ninth Circuit further noted that although\n24 the California Attorney General has statutory control over the sheriffs in a law enforcement\n25 capacity, in California, the counties hold the ultimate power over the jails.  Id.  In so doing, the\n26 Ninth Circuit compared Cal. Gov. Code ยง 12560 (granting attorney general powers over\n27 sheriffsโ activities relevant to the โinvestigation or detection of crimeโ), with Cal. Gov. Code ยง\n28 25303 (granting the county boards of supervisors broad fiscal and administrative powers for the\n29\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 91      Filed 03/31/2009     Page 30 of 32\n1 management of the individual county jails), and also examined California Government Code\n2 provisions supporting the countyโs liability, including Cal. Gov. Code ยงยง 815.2 (monetary\n3 damages paid by county), 24000(b) (sheriff included as county officer). \n4 Defendants argue that at the time of the Streit ruling, the California Supreme Court had\n5 not issued its ruling in Venegas, 32 Cal.4th 820.  In Venegas, the court considered the issue of\n6 whether a sheriff acts on behalf of the state or county when conducting a criminal investigation,\n7 including detaining suspects and searching their home and vehicle.  The defendants, a county\n8 acting on behalf of its sheriffโs department and sheriff, claimed they were immune from liability\n9 under the Eleventh Amendment because the sheriff acts on behalf of the state rather than the\n10 county when engaged in investigating crime.  Id. at 829.  The court concluded that sheriffs act\n11 on behalf of the state when performing law enforcement activities.  Id. at 839.  In so concluding,\n12 the court relied on two other state decisions that were confined to situations in which district\n13 attorneys and sheriffs were actually engaged in performing law enforcement duties, such as\n14 investigating and prosecuting crime, or training staff and developing policy involving such\n15 matters. Id. at 838.      \n16 The Venegas decision does not overturn Ninth Circuit precedent on this issue regarding\n17 a federal statute and does not control on issues of federal law.  See Brown, 2008 WL 544565, at\n18 * 12 (declining to conclude that county sheriffs act on behalf of the state when conducting law\n19 enforcement activities).  This Court is bound by Ninth Circuit precedent and declines to hold\n20 that the Kern County Sheriffs were acting on behalf of the State of California. \n21 Defendantsโ motion for summary adjudication against Plaintiffsโ causes of action for ยง\n22 1983 claims on that ground that the Sheriffs are state actors is DENIED.  \n23 4. County of Kern\n24 Defendantsโ contend that the County of Kern is an improper party to this action and\n25 request that their motion for summary adjudication as to any claims asserted against the County\n26 be granted.  To support this contention, Defendants argue:\n27 the Kern County Sheriff in his official capacity, in addressing and fighting crime\nwithin the confines of the jail, acts on behalf of the State of California.\n28 Therefore, in that capacity he did not act on behalf of the County of Kern. Thus,\n30\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 91      Filed 03/31/2009     Page 31 of 32\n1 because he was acting for the State and not the County of Kern, no liability can\nbe imputed to the County of Kern under Monell for any actions related to the\n2 strip search of detainees returning to the jail from the Kern County Superior\nCourt for appearances related to the criminal charges against them. Accordingly,\n3 the County of Kern is an improper party to this action....\n4 (Defs.โ Mot. Sum. Adjud. Re: Court Returnees, Qualified Immunity and Eleventh Amendment\n5 Immunity 20-21).  As the Court has rejected Defendantsโ argument that the Kern County Sheriff\n6 is acting on behalf of the State, the Court also rejects Defendantsโ related argument that the\n7 County cannot be liable.  Defendantsโ motion for summary adjudication as to section 1983\n8 claims asserted against the County is DENIED.\n9 CONCLUSION AND ORDER\n10 For the reasons set forth above, \n11 1.  Plaintiffsโ motion for partial summary judgment/summary adjudication limited to\n12 KCSOโs policy of group strip searching prisoners in violation of the Fourth Amendment is\n13 GRANTED.  Defendantsโ motion for summary adjudication as to this claim is DENIED.\n14 2.  Plaintiffsโ motion for partial summary judgment/summary adjudication limited to\n15 KCSOโs policy of strip searching persons ordered released from custody in violation of the\n16 Fourth Amendment is GRANTED.  Defendantsโ summary adjudication motion regarding the\n17 court-returnee class is DENIED.\n18 3.  Defendantsโ motion for summary adjudication limited to the extent that Plaintiffs\n19 have alleged a Fourteenth Amendment due process violation regarding group strip searches is\n20 GRANTED.\n21 4.  Defendantsโ motion for summary adjudication as to Plaintiffsโ Equal Protection\n22 Clause claim as to persons alleging group strip searches is GRANTED.\n23 5.  Plaintiffsโ motion for partial summary judgment/summary adjudication regarding\n24 violation of California Constitution, Article I, Section 1 is GRANTED.\n25 6.  Plaintiffsโ motion for partial summary judgment regarding their third cause of action\n26 for violation of California Constitution Article 1, section 13 is DENIED.\n27 7.

Specifically, Plaintiffs\n9 allege, inter alia, that their rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments were violated when\n10 they were purportedly subjected to visual body cavity searches at the same time as other prisoners\n11 (hereinafter โgroup searchโ) while in the custody of the Kern County Sheriffโs Office (โKCSOโ). \n12 The undisputed evidence in this case establishes that the searches of Plaintiffs were constitutionally\n13 sound and the fact that some may have occurred in small groups does not violate Plaintiffsโ rights.\n14 Plaintiffsโ First Amended Complaint (โFACโ) asserts various claims for relief against\n15 Defendants. In this motion, Defendants move for summary adjudication as to those claims asserted\n16 under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and state law specific to group searches.  Defendants\n17 base their motion on the clear and undisputed evidence establishing that Plaintiffs have not been\n18 deprived of any constitutional rights, as well as overwhelming legal precedent establishing that group\n19\n20\n1Defendants file this joint Motion for Summary Adjudication contemporaneous with their Opposition\n21 to Plaintiffsโ Motion for Class Certification, pursuant to Eastern District Local Rule 78-230(e), which\nprovides:\n22\nAny counter-motion or other motion that a party may\n23 desire to make that is related to the general subject matter\nof the original motion shall be served and filed with the\n24\nClerk in the manner and on the date prescribed for the\nfiling of opposition. In the event such counter-motion or\n25\nother related motion is filed, the Court may continue the\nhearing on the original and all related motions so as to\n26\ngive all parties reasonable opportunity to serve and file\noppositions and replies to all pending motions.\n27\n28 In this Motion, Defendants seek to eliminate one of the proposed classes that Plaintiffs seek to certify.  Thus,\nthis motion is related to the general subject matter of the original motion.\nP O R T E R  *  S C O T T\nATTORNEYS\n350 UNIVERSITY AVE., SUITE 200\nSACRAMENTO, CA 95825 MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY ADJUDICATION\nTEL: 916. 929.1481\nwFwAwX.p: o9r1t6e.r 9s2c7o.t3t7.c0o6m 00597684.WPD 1\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 37    Filed 07/17/08   Page 7 of 22\n1 searches are not per se in violation of the Constitution as Plaintiffs contend.\n2 II.\n3 STATEMENT OF FACTS\n4 A. General Description of KCSO Jail Facilities \n5 KCSO jails have about 2,500 beds between four different facilities.  Defs. Undisputed\n6 Material Fact (โUMFโ) 1.  These facilities include Central Receiving Facility (CRF), Ridgecrest,\n7 Mojave, and Lerdo.  UMF 2.  Lerdo is divided into four different divisions: pretrial, maximum-\n8 medium (โmax-medโ), female minimum and male minimum.  UMF 3. The average total inmate\n9 population per day is 2,300. UMF 4.  Generally the status of the inmate population house at the\n10 Lerdo facilities is, at a minimum, post-arraignment.  UMF 65.\n11 The main function of CRF is booking and receiving arrestees coming straight off the street.\n12 UMF 5.  Since at least 2003, pre-arraigned misdemeanor arrestees at CRF were not subject to strip\n13 searches on a routine basis, either before or after their first court appearance, such as arraignment.\n14 UMF 6. \n15 In the other KCSO jail facilities, such as Lerdo, inmates are housed based upon their\n16 classification. UMF 7.  Each inmateโs classification is determined by a multitude of factors\n17 including, but not limited to, gang affiliation; mental and medical status; conduct while at the\n18 facility; past conduct while incarcerated, whether at Lerdo or at a different facility; and, the nature\n19 of the charges that caused them to be in custody.   UMF 8.\n20 The inmate population housed at Lerdo has exploded in recent years and the facilities cannot\n21 be used as originally intended.   UMF 9.  The various Lerdo facilities were originally intended to\n22 function as their names describe.   UMF 10.  Over time, the Lerdo facilities have been forced to\n23 house inmates together according to the security risk that each inmate poses and the other\n24 classification factors cited above, rather than merely whether an inmate has not been tried, for\n25 example.  UMF 11.  Thus, the name of the particular Lerdo facility does not determine where the\n26 inmate is housed nor does it necessarily accurately describe the security risk or type of inmate housed\n27 there. UMF 12.  At the Lerdo Max-Med facility, there are two blocks of 17 cells  that house one\n28 inmate per cell.   UMF 13.   These single cells contain a toilet.   UMF 14.  The toilet in each cell\nP O R T E R  *  S C O T T\nATTORNEYS\n350 UNIVERSITY AVE., SUITE 200\nSACRAMENTO, CA 95825 MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY ADJUDICATION\nTEL: 916. 929.1481\nwFwAwX.p: o9r1t6e.r 9s2c7o.t3t7.c0o6m 00597684.WPD 2\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 37    Filed 07/17/08   Page 8 of 22\n1 does not have any provision for privacy and the view of the cell contents and the toilet is open to\n2 anyone passing in the corridor in front of the cells, including other inmates and custodial staff.  UMF\n3 15.   In these cell blocks, there are two shower cells that each allows showering by one inmate at a\n4 time.  UMF 16.  Like the toilet, these showers are open to the view of anyone passing through the\n5 corridor outside of the cell.  UMF 17.\n6 Other than these two blocks of cells at the Max-Med facility, there are two tiers of cells,\n7 approximately 14 cells, that house between six and twelve inmates.  UMF 18.  Each cell has a toilet\n8 for use by the inmate assigned to the cell.  UMF 19.  There is no provision for privacy in these cells\n9 and toileting is done within full view of other inmates.  UMF 20.  The remaining โcellsโ are\n10 dormitory style which house up to 31 inmates.  UMF 21.  Like the other cells, the toileting\n11 provisions are open to view by other inmates and custodial staff.  UMF 22.   Similarly, the shower\n12 facilities are โgym-styleโ in which there are two walls of shower heads within the shower room\n13 which allow multiple inmates to shower at the same time. UMF 23.  As a result, showering and\n14 undressing/dressing is done within the view of other inmates. UMF 24.\n15 At the Lerdo Minimum facilities, inmates are housed โbarracks style.โ  UMF 25.  Each of\n16 these barracks houses approximately 41 inmates.  UMF 26.  Although the toilets and showers are\n17 situated in separate rooms connected to the barracks, toileting and showering โ including dressing\n18 and undressing related to showering โ occur within the view of the other inmates who are present\n19 in the toilet or shower room.  UMF 27.\n20 Inmates are not permitted to leave their housing assignment for the purpose of using a toilet\n21 in a different area unless the inmate had a medical issue that required it and then the inmateโs\n22 housing assignment would likely be changed to the medical clinic. UMF 28.  However, other than\n23 a medical reason, an inmate would not be permitted to leave their housing unit to use a preferred\n24 toilet elsewhere. UMF 29.\n25 B. Contraband in KCSO Facilities and Related Inmate Searches\n26 Inmate possession of contraband is an extreme problem for all of the KCSO jail facilities.\n27 Within the last five years, approximately 915 inmates in the Lerdo facility have been found guilty\n28 of violating the facility rule that prohibits inmates from making or possessing contraband that poses\nP O R T E R  *  S C O T T\nATTORNEYS\n350 UNIVERSITY AVE., SUITE 200\nSACRAMENTO, CA 95825 MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY ADJUDICATION\nTEL: 916. 929.1481\nwFwAwX.p: o9r1t6e.r 9s2c7o.t3t7.c0o6m 00597684.WPD 3\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 37    Filed 07/17/08   Page 9 of 22\n1 a hazard to health, safety, or facility security. UMF 30.  The contraband located commonly includes\n2 drugs, weapons, and escape tools.  UMF 31.   Additionally, approximately 986 inmates have been\n3 found guilty of violating the facility rules prohibiting other types of contraband.   UMF 32.  These\n4 statistics cannot demonstrate the deterrent effect of searches, since inmates were less likely to move\n5 or carry contraband when they knew they were going to be strip searched.  UMF 33.  Since\n6 September of 2007, strip searches has discovered inmate possession of contraband in approximately\n7 22 incidents.   UMF 34.\n8 Procedure D of KCSO Policy C-500 specifies that persons in the general inmate population\n9 (not pre-arraignment detainees) โmay be subjected to a strip search or visual body cavity search in\n10 the following situations: after leaving and then returning to the facility (i.e., medical appointment,\n11 court, etc.); after completing their assigned duties inside or outside the facility and returning to their\n12 housing area; after any contact visit; and, if an officer has a reasonable suspicion that they are\n13 concealing a weapon or contraband and that a strip search or visual body cavity search will result in\n14 discovery of the weapon or contraband.โ UMF 35.  Inmates are subject to strip searches when they\n15 return from court appearances because they mingled with other inmates from their housing unit,\n16 other units and other Lerdo jail facilities on the transport bus and while at court.  UMF 36.  Given\n17 the amount of contraband that was discovered at the jail facilities, KCSO officers believe that\n18 inmates frequently obtain this contraband as a result of the court contact.  UMF 37.  For example,\n19 inmates somehow obtain portions of latex gloves, in particular the fingers of the gloves, and use the\n20 latex to envelope contraband.  UMF 38.  The inmates then place the contraband in their rectums for\n21 transport back to the Lerdo facility. UMF 39.  The reasonable belief regarding the source of\n22 contraband in KCSO jails is supported by the sworn testimony of Plaintiff Marsial Lopez, who\n23 testified that sometimes when the inmates who were returning from court were strip searched,\n24 officers discovered contraband on their person hidden in pieces of a latex gloves.  UMF 40.  Even\n25 then, despite being strip searched, Lopez testified that inmates were still sometimes able to get\n26 contraband into the jail facility.  UMF 41.\n27 Failure to locate contraband possessed by KCSO prisoners has proven to have potentially\n28 life-threatening consequences. In a widely publicized incident in 2007, convicted mass-murderer\nP O R T E R  *  S C O T T\nATTORNEYS\n350 UNIVERSITY AVE., SUITE 200\nSACRAMENTO, CA 95825 MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY ADJUDICATION\nTEL: 916. 929.1481\nwFwAwX.p: o9r1t6e.r 9s2c7o.t3t7.c0o6m 00597684.WPD 4\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 37    Filed 07/17/08   Page 10 of 22\n1 managed to secrete a fabricated handcuff key in his hair during a visit to court.  UMF 42.  This key\n2 was discovered during a strip search of his person. UMF 43.  In another incident, a murder suspect\n3 was strip searched related to a court appointment in May of 2007. UMF 44.  A razor blade was\n4 discovered in his shoe.  UMF 45.  In May of 2008, this same inmate was transported to a hospital\n5 without being strip searched.  UMF 46.  He produced a stolen handcuff key, removed his restraints,\n6 and fled.  UMF 47.  He was recaptured by deputies, but not before he broke into an occupied\n7 apartment in an attempt to evade the pursuit. UMF 48.\n8 By March 2005, the jail population had grown to such an extent that the available man-power\n9 had been outstripped by the size of the population.  UMF 49.  To meet the other staffing/security\n10 needs of the various facilities, frequently as few as one or two detention deputies were available to\n11 conduct strip searches at any given time.  UMF 50.  Other operations could not be scheduled around\n12 court returns because the timing and number of inmates returning to a particular Lerdo facility was\n13 unpredictable.  UMF 51.   In addition, the limited space at the Lerdo facilities, dictated that\n14 individual searches could not occur in a timely fashion.  UMF 52.  This would have meant that,\n15 while the individual searches were occurring, the rest of the inmates had to wait in holding cells.\n16 UMF 53. This problem was complicated further by the fact that inmates of different housing\n17 classifications could not be held together to await their search due to the probability of violence that\n18 this would incite.  UMF 54.  Commingling inmates outside of their classifications would have been\n19 a safety risk to the inmates and a threat to the internal security of the facility. UMF 55.  Even\n20 commingling inmates of the same classification in close quarters for the amount of time required to\n21 conduct the individual searches would have posed the potential for a violent exchange which was\n22 a threat to the security of the jail.  UMF 56.  Additionally, in most cases, those inmate who had been\n23 searched would also have to be placed in  separate holding cells, segregated by classification, or staff\n24 would have to be assigned to individually escort each searched inmate back to his/her housing unit.\n25 UMF 57.  Thus, to individually strip search each inmate returning from court would effectively\n26 require a doubling of the already limited holding cells or enough staff to individually escort each\n27 searched inmate back to his/her housing unit.

Inmates have\n19 necessarily shown a lapse in ability to control and conform their behavior to the legitimate standards\n20 of society by the normal impulses of self-restraint; they have shown an inability to regulate their\n21 conduct in a way that reflects either a respect for law or an appreciation of the rights of others.โ\n22 Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 526 (1984). Indeed, the courts recognize that jails and prisons are\n23 places of confinement that necessarily result in a prisonerโs loss of freedom of choice and privacy.\n24 Bell v. Wolfish,  441 U.S. 520, 537 (1979); Peckharn v. Wisc. Dept. of Corr., 141 F.3d 694, 696-697\n25 (7th Cir. 1998); Johnson v. Phelan, 69 F.3d 144, 146 (7th Cir. 1995); Bell v. Wolfish,  441 U.S. 520,\n26 559 (1979).

United States v. Dawson, 516 F.2d 796, 805-806  (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 855\n3 (1975); United States v. Savage, 482 F.2d 1371, 1373 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 932 (1973).\n4 While the Fourth Amendment prohibits searches which are unreasonable, the Supreme Court\n5 has held that the reasonableness of a challenged search in the prison context is dependant upon a\n6 balancing between the rights of prisoners against the need for the particular search.  Bell,  441 U.S.\n7 at 559; see Hudson, at 527 (determining whether an expectation of privacy is โlegitimateโ or\n8 โreasonableโ necessarily entails a balancing of interests). Among the factors considered are โthe\n9 scope of the particular intrusion, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is\n10 conducted.โ Id.  Although the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has recognized that prisoners retain\n11 limited rights to bodily privacy under the Fourth Amendment, those rights must be determined in\n12 reference to the prison context. Thompson v. Souza, 111 F.3d 694, 699 (9th Cir. 1997) (internal\n13 quotations omitted) (citing Michenfelder v. Sumner, 860 F.2d 328, 333-34 (9th Cir. 1988)).\n14 Moreover, in achieving an acceptable balance between prison security and rights of prisoners, courts\n15 are deferential to the experienced judgment of prison administrators. See, e.g.,  Sandin v. Conner,\n16 515 U.S. 472  (1995); Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 85 (1987); Bell, 441 U.S. at 540 n.27, 547. \n17 As observed by the Supreme Court in Bell: \n18 [M]aintaining institutional security and preserving\ninternal order and discipline are essential goals that\n19 may require limitation or retraction of the retained\nconstitutional rights of both convicted prisoners and\n20 pretrial detainees. โ[Central] to all other corrections\ngoals is the institutional consideration of internal\n21 security within the corrections facilities themselves.โ\nPrison officials must be free to take appropriate action\n22 to  ensure  the  safety  of  inmates  and  corrections\npersonnel and to prevent escape or unauthorized entry.\n23 Accordingly,  we  have  held  that  even  when  an\ninstitutional  restriction  infringes  a  specific\n24 constitutional  guarantee  ...  the  practice  must  be\nevaluated in the light of the central objective of prison\n25 administration, safeguarding institutional security.\n26 441 at 546-47.\n27 Given such security concerns, it is reasonable and not unconstitutional for jail officials to\n28 conduct regular strip searches of detainees involving visual body-cavity inspections .

Thus, a prisoner claiming a constitutional violation arising out of a strip search has a\n2 โheavy burdenโ of proving (1) that a strip search was not rationally related to a legitimate security\n3 interest, and (2) that it was conducted in a harassing manner intended to humiliate and inflict\n4 psychological pain. Bell, 441 U.S. at 561-62; Whitman v. Nesic, 368 F.3d 931, 934 (7th Cir. 2004);\n5 Calhoun v. Detella, 319 F.3d 936, 939 (7th Cir. 2003). \n6 Here, Plaintiffs cannot satisfy the first element of their  burden of proof because the facts\n7 establish that there were legitimate, identifiable security reasons to conduct visual body searches in\n8 groups.  The body searches clearly were done with penological justification and KCSO had and\n9 continues have the responsibility of holding inmates and other prisoners in custody pending trial as\n10 well as after sentencing. This responsibility includes the need to maintain safety and order for both\n11 the inmates and the staff of each facility.  Defendants have proffered clear evidence regarding the\n12 necessity of security for conducting the searches themselves as well as conducting the searches in\n13 small groups.  The undisputed facts clearly establish that in the last five years, approximately 1,900\n14 inmates in KCSO custody have been found guilty of having some type of prohibited contraband.\n15 The undisputed facts also establish that since September 2007, KCSO has discovered contraband\n16 possessed by 22 inmates as a result of the strip searches. Indeed, the sworn testimony of Plaintiff\n17 Lopez corroborates the fact that prisoners were able to pass contraband after being out of the facility\n18 for court appearances.  Thus, increased vigilance remains essential in order to discover and deter any\n19 activity involving contraband. Defendants have also provided herein specific examples of extremely\n20 dangerous  inmates  who  were  found  with  contraband  when  strip  searched,  as  well  as  the\n21 consequences of what happens when inmates are not strip searched.  Thus, because KCSO had\n22 legitimate security reasons for the body searches, the searches had penological justification and\n23 cannot be found to be unconstitutional. See Bell, 441 U.S. at 558-62; Peckham, 141 F.3d at 695, 697;\n24 Koger v. Snyder, 252 F.Supp.2d 723, 725-26 (C.D. Ill. 2003).\n25 Plaintiffs also cannot demonstrate that the searches, as conducted in a group, were excessive\n26 in their performance or that they amounted to calculated harassment unrelated to jail needs and done\n27 with the intent to humiliate and inflict psychological pain. Whitman, 368 F.3d at 934.

In a matter similar to this case, the plaintiffs in\n3 Fernandez v. Rapone, 926 F.Supp. 255  (D.Mass. 1996), also alleged that their constitutional rights\n4 had been violated because they had been strip searched in front of other inmates and officers.  See\n5 id. at 262. There, the court noted that in the prison setting, inmates share cells with other prisoners\n6 and shower with fellow inmates. Id.  Likewise, the defendants contended, and the court agreed, that\n7 โ[t]hroughout the day, the inmates, โwhether dressing, bathing or even defecating,โ are observed by\n8 fellow inmates and male and female correction officers.โ Id. Accordingly, the โdefendants properly\n9 maintain that standing naked within the possible view of other inmates for a brief period of time is\n10 โhardly shocking or unreasonable in light of the vital security interest [the searches seek] to preserve\n11 against the backdrop of day to day prison life.โโ Id.  Therefore, the District Court concluded โthat\n12 the fact that plaintiffs were often searched in the presence of other inmates being searched [did] not\n13 render the searches unreasonable.โ  Id. \n14 Similarly, in Zunker v. Bertrand, 798 F. Supp. 1365 (E.D.Wis. 1992), the district court held\n15 that an inmate's โprivacy interest in not having other inmates view the strip searches [did not\n16 outweigh] the security interests of the prison [and, therefore,] as a matter of lawโฆeven if other\n17 inmates observed plaintiff being strip searched, his constitutional rights were not violated.โ Id. at\n18 1370; see also United States v. Cofield, 391 F.3d 334, 337(1st Cir. 2004) (strip search in hallway\n19 near booking desk was not unconstitutional); Franklin v. Lockhart, 883 F.2d 654 (8th Cir. 1989)\n20 (upholding constitutionality of visual body cavity searches in a hallway within view of inmates in\n21 nearby cells and in passageway in groups of four); Thompson, 111 F.3d at 701 (9th Cir. 1997)\n22 (rejecting plaintiffโs claim that the strip searches should have been conducted out of the view of other\n23 prisoners, in a more private location).\n24  Defendants note that the district court in Craft v. County of San Bernardino, 468 F.Supp.2d\n25 1172 (C.D. Cal. 2006), took a different view in regard to the group search issue. However, the fact\n26 that the searches at issue in Craft occurred in group settings was only one of the factors the court\n27 considered in reaching its decision.  Id.  The decision was limited to those pre-arraignment prisoners\n28 who were strip searched before being transferred to another unit and arrestees returning from court\nP O R T E R  *  S C O T T\nATTORNEYS\n350 UNIVERSITY AVE., SUITE 200\nSACRAMENTO, CA 95825 MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY ADJUDICATION\nTEL: 916. 929.1481\nwFwAwX.p: o9r1t6e.r 9s2c7o.t3t7.c0o6m 00597684.WPD 10\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 37    Filed 07/17/08   Page 16 of 22\n1 who had been found to be entitled to release.  Id. at 1180.   In Craft, it was the policy of the detention\n2 facility to strip and/or visual body cavity search all arrestees (including those booked on non-violent,\n3 non-drug related charges) prior to arraignment, regardless of individualized suspicion to conduct the\n4 strip and/or visual body cavity search on the arrestee.  Id. at 1174. The defendants in Craft contended\n5 that the searches were necessary for security reasons, but the court disagreed, stating that evidence\n6 the defendants provided showed only two discoveries of contraband in nearly two years.  Id.  The\n7 evidence provided by Defendants also did not specify whether the discoveries were made pursuant\n8 to a search of a pre-arraignment transferee (the group at issue in the case), or of some other group.\n9 See id.\n10 More important, the binding precedent of the Ninth Circuit has rejected the argument that\n11 strip searches must be conducted in a private place outside of view of other inmates.  Thompson, 111\n12 F.3d at 701 (9th Cir. 1997); Michenfelder, 860 F.2d at 333.   The Craft court, by comparison, relied\n13 almost exclusively on Way v. County of Ventura, 445 F.3d 1157 (9th Cir. 2008), to conclude that\n14 the group strip searches in San Bernardino County were improper.  However, Way, like Craft, also\n15 is distinguishable.  The Ninth Circuit in Way recognized the intrusive nature of the strip search, just\n16 as it did in Thompson, and also recognized โthe difficulty of operating a detention facility safely, the\n17 seriousness of the risk of smuggled weapons and contraband, and the deference we owe jail officialsโ\n18 exercise of judgment in adopting and executing policies necessary to maintain institutional security.โ\n19 Id. at 1161 (citing Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 546-47).   However, unlike here, the Defendants in Way\n20 โfailed to show any link between their blanket strip search policy and legitimate security concerns[.]โ\n21 Id.   Instead, the defendants โmade only a conclusory submission that the purpose of the search\n22 protocol is โto provide facility security and to ensure the inmate's health and safety[.]โโ Id.  By\n23 comparison, the Way court noted that evidence in the record in Wolfish established detaineesโ\n24 attempts to secrete money, drugs, weapons and other contraband in body cavities. Id.; see Wolfish,\n25 at 559. \n26 This case is easily distinguishable from both Craft and Way.   Here, the Court is not asked\n27 to consider searches of pre-arraignment detainees; rather, the searches pertain to post-arraignment\n28 and in some cases post-conviction and sentenced inmates. Moreover, as discussed above, the\nP O R T E R  *  S C O T T\nATTORNEYS\n350 UNIVERSITY AVE., SUITE 200\nSACRAMENTO, CA 95825 MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY ADJUDICATION\nTEL: 916. 929.1481\nwFwAwX.p: o9r1t6e.r 9s2c7o.t3t7.c0o6m 00597684.WPD 11\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 37    Filed 07/17/08   Page 17 of 22\n1 undisputed facts clearly establish 1) the need to conduct the searches; and, 2) the need to conduct the\n2 searches in small groups.  Certainly, the undisputed facts establish the success that has been realized\n3 in preventing the introduction of contraband into the KCSO jail facilities through strip searches.  The\n4 facts also establish that the staffing limitations coupled with the ever-increasing inmate population\n5 and their related security risk require that the optimal means for corrections officers to conduct the\n6 searches and to maintain institutional security for staff and inmates were to conduct the searches in\n7 small groups.  Thus, the group strip searches do not violate the Fourth Amendment rights of\n8 Plaintiffs or any other inmate incarcerated in KCSO custody and Defendantsโ Motion for Summary\n9 Adjudication in this regard should be granted.\n10 V.\n11 THE GROUP SEARCHES AT ISSUE DO NOT VIOLATE \nPLAINTIFFSโ RIGHTS UNDER THE DUE PROCESS \n12 CLAUSE OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT\n13 In Bell, the Supreme Court enunciated the appropriate legal standard for evaluating the\n14 constitutionality of a strip search involving a post-arraignment detainee.  441 U.S. at 535.  โ[U]nder\n15 the Due Process Clause, a detainee may not be punished prior to an adjudication of guilt in\n16 accordance with due process of law.โ  Id.  The inquiry for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment\n17 protection in Bell requires the court to determine whether there was an express intent to punish, or\n18 โwhether an alternative purpose to which [the strip search] may rationally be connected is assignable\n19 for it, and whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned [to it].โ Id. at\n20 538 (quoting Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. 144, 168-69 (1963)).  Absent evidence of\n21 express punitive intent, the Ninth Circuit has noted that โto constitute punishment, the harm or\n22 disability caused the governmentโs action must either significantly exceed, or be independent of, the\n23 inherent discomforts of confinement.โ  Demery v. Arpaio, 378 F.3d 1020, 1030 (9th Cir. 2004).  \n24 Here, as discussed at length above in regard to Plaintiffsโ Fourth Amendment claim, there\n25 are no facts to suggest that any of the Plaintiffs were strip searched as a means for punishment โ\n26 whether they were searched alone or while in a small group.  The rational basis for conducting the\n27 strip search is permitted for security concerns as a matter of law.  The need for these searches to be\n28 conducted as a group in light of the staff constraints proportionate to inmate population. There are\nP O R T E R  *  S C O T T\nATTORNEYS\n350 UNIVERSITY AVE., SUITE 200\nSACRAMENTO, CA 95825 MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY ADJUDICATION\nTEL: 916. 929.1481\nwFwAwX.p: o9r1t6e.r 9s2c7o.t3t7.c0o6m 00597684.WPD 12\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 37    Filed 07/17/08   Page 18 of 22\n1 no facts to indicate that strip searching inmates in front of other inmates was punishment, nor can\n2 it be said that the group searches significantly exceed the inherent discomforts of confinement,\n3 particularly where inmates regularly observe each other showering and toileting due to the standard\n4 conditions of incarceration. Thus, Defendantsโ practice of searching of inmates in small groups does\n5 not violate Plaintiffsโ constitutional rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and Defendants\n6 respectfully request that their Motion for Adjudication should be granted as a matter of law. \n7 VI.\n8 PLAINTIFFSโ EQUAL PROTECTION CLAIM FAILS BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT\nDIFFERENCES BETWEEN POST-ARRAIGNMENT DETAINEES AND POST-\n9 SENTENCING PRISONERS\n10 Any alleged differential treatment between post-arraignment detainees and pre-arraignment\n11 detainees is not unconstitutional.  The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\n12 commands that no state shall deny any person the equal protection of the laws. City of Cleburne v.\n13 Cleburne Living Center, 473 U.S. 432 (1985). As a result, โall persons similarly circumstanced shall\n14 be treated alike.โ Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 216 (1982) (quoting F.S. Royster Guano Co. v.\n15 Virginia, 253 U.S. 412, 415 (1920)).  \n16 Generally, when state action is challenged on equal protection grounds, either strict scrutiny\n17 or the rational basis analysis is applied.  Hoffman v. United States, 767 F.2d 1431, 1434 (9th Cir.\n18 1985). Strict scrutiny applies when the stateโs classification is alleged to have been made on\n19 โsuspectโ grounds such as race, ancestry, alienage, or categorizations impinging upon fundamental\n20 rights such as privacy, marriage, voting, travel, and freedom of association. Id. at 1434-35. When\n21 no suspect class is involved and a fundamental right has not been burdened, a rational basis test to\n22 determine the legitimacy of the state's classifications is appropriate. Kahawaiolaa v. Norton, 386\n23 F.3d 1271, 1277-78 (9th Cir. 2004).  \n24 While strict scrutiny has been applied to prison classifications based on a suspect class, such\n25 as race, the Supreme Court has not concluded that the burdening of prisonersโ fundamental rights\n26 in subject to the same.  Johnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499  (2005).  In Turner, supra, the Supreme\n27 Court held that when โa prison regulation impinges on inmatesโ constitutional rights, the regulation\n28 is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.โ 482 U.S. at  89.

Bazzetta, 539 U.S. 126, 131\n3 (2003)).  Accordingly, imprisonment permits the greater restriction of constitutional rights than\n4 would otherwise be valid and many constitutional rights enjoyed prior to incarceration are curtailed\n5 or lost upon imprisonment. Beard v. Banks, 126 S. Ct. 2572, 2577-78 (2006); Overton, 539 U.S. at\n6 128.\n7 Nevertheless, with respect to the extent of curtailment of privacy rights, the Ninth Circuit has\n8 concluded it does not violate the Constitution for such limitations to be same for pretrial detainees\n9 as for convicted inmates. United States v. Van Poyck, 77 F.3d 285, 291 (9th Cir. Cal. 1996) (citing\n10 Bell).  The only difference between the two groups for purposes of evaluation under the Constitution\n11 is that pretrial detainees are protected by the Fourteenth Amendmentโs Due Process Clause, as well\n12 as specific substantive guarantees of the federal Constitution, such as the Eighth Amendment. Under\n13 the Due Process Clause, detainees have a right against jail conditions or restrictions that โamount\n14 to punishment.โ Bell, 441 U.S. at 535-37. This standard differs from the standard relevant to\n15 convicted prisoners only with respect to that fact that convicted prisoners may be subject to\n16 punishment so long as it does not violate the Eighth Amendmentโs bar against cruel and unusual\n17 punishment. Id. at 535 n.16; see Pierce v. County of Orange, 526 F.3d 1190, 1205 (9th Cir. Cal.\n18 2008).   In other words, under Van Poyck, it is constitutionally acceptable to treat these two groups\n19 essentially the same as to infringement on privacy.  In contrast, the Ninth Circuit also has specifically\n20 addressed the lawfulness of strip searches in cases involving pre-arraignment arrestees: โarrestees\n21 for minor offenses may be subjected to a strip search only if jail officials have a reasonable suspicion\n22 that the particular arrestee is carrying or concealing contraband or suffering from a communicable\n23 disease.โ Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614. 615 (9th Cir.1984) (per curiam) (overruled on other\n24 grounds by Hodgers-Durgin v. de la Vina, 199 F.3d 1037, 1041 (9th Cir.1999) (en banc)). Factors\n25 such as โthe nature of the offense, the arresteeโs appearance and conduct, and the prior arrest recordโ\n26 determine reasonable suspicion. Giles, 746 F.2d at 617.\n27 Here, Plaintiffsโ claim regarding any type of disparate treatment based on prisoner status fails\n28 as a matter of law.  Plaintiffs overlook the most fundamental aspect of a claim asserted under the\nP O R T E R  *  S C O T T\nATTORNEYS\n350 UNIVERSITY AVE., SUITE 200\nSACRAMENTO, CA 95825 MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY ADJUDICATION\nTEL: 916. 929.1481\nwFwAwX.p: o9r1t6e.r 9s2c7o.t3t7.c0o6m 00597684.WPD 14\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 37    Filed 07/17/08   Page 20 of 22\n1 Equal Protection Clause: that the comparison must be between โpersons similarly circumstanced.โ\n2 Plyler, 457 U.S. at 216.  Dissimilar treatment of dissimilarly situated persons does not violate equal\n3 protection. See Barket, Levy & Fine, Inc. v. St. Louis Thermal Energy Corp., 21 F.3d 237, 242 (8th\n4 Cir. 1994). Thus, the first step in an equal protection case is determining whether the plaintiff has\n5 demonstrated that he was treated differently than others who were similarly situated to him. See, e.g.,\n6 Samaad v. City of Dallas, 940 F.2d 925, 940- 41 (5th Cir. 1991). Absent a threshold showing that\n7 he is similarly situated to those who allegedly receive different treatment, the plaintiff does not have\n8 a viable equal protection claim. Klinger v. Department of Corrections, 31 F.3d 727, 731 (8th Cir.\n9 1994). \n10 There can be no debate that pre-arraignment arrestees and post-arraignment prisoners are not\n11 similarly situated and therefore the long-standing legal distinctions between the two groups do not\n12 violate any tenet of Equal Protection.  The critical difference lies in the fact that members of the first\n13 group are brought in off the street and await a hearing and formal charges; without reasonable\n14 suspicion of possession of contraband or violent tendencies that would constitute a security risk to\n15 the jail or staff, there is no grounds for which members of this group may be searched.  However,\n16 as to post-arraignment prisoners, a court of law has found, already probable cause to charge them\n17 with a specific crime. They are returned to the custody of the jail pursuant to court order, where the\n18 limitations on their privacy are as diminished as they would be for convicted prisoners in light of\n19 their ability to commingle with other members of the general jail population.  Further, post-\n20 arraignment prisoners are often removed from the secure setting of the jail where, unlike pre-\n21 arraignment arrestees who are just entering the jail, they are able to obtain contraband.  Furthermore,\n22 because post-arraignment prisoners will remain in jail, they have a greater incentive to smuggle in\n23 contraband from outside the facility.  There simply is no way as a fundamental matter of law to\n24 equate these two groups of prisoners for purposes of equal protection, nor have the courts seen fit\n25 to do so.  \n26 In addition, Plaintiffโs allegations regarding the inequality of Penal Code section 4030 must\n27 fail.  Section 4030 applies only โonly to prearraignment detainees arrested for infraction or\n28 misdemeanor offenses.โ  Pen. Code ยง 4030.  In other words, Section 4030 was enacted to regulate\nP O R T E R  *  S C O T T\nATTORNEYS\n350 UNIVERSITY AVE., SUITE 200\nSACRAMENTO, CA 95825 MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY ADJUDICATION\nTEL: 916. 929.1481\nwFwAwX.p: o9r1t6e.r 9s2c7o.t3t7.c0o6m 00597684.WPD 15\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 37    Filed 07/17/08   Page 21 of 22\n1 booking searches โ i.e., the searches to which all arrestees are subjected regardless of whether they\n2 will be released after booking.  Specifically, Penal Code section 4030(f) prohibits strip searching an\n3 individual arrested on a misdemeanor offense not involving weapons, controlled substances or\n4 violence โprior to placement in the general jail populationโ unless a peace officer has determined that\n5 there is reasonable suspicion that the individual is concealing contraband.  Cal.Penal.Code ยง4030(f).\n6 Here, Plaintiffs have abandoned their claims regarding certification of strip searches of pre-\n7 arraignment detainees because the evidence clearly demonstrates that such searches simply did not\n8 happen. The evidence further establishes that only post-arraignment prisoners were ever subjected\n9 to strip searches, whether alone or in a group.  Because Section 4030 by its terms applies only to\n10 arrestees who are strip searched before arraignment, the claims asserted by Plaintiffs or any party\n11 they purport to represent as part of a class who were strip searched in groups fails as a matter of law.\n12 Moreover, even if Plaintiffs believe that section 4030 is in some way unfair, it is the clear intent of\n13 the California Legislature to limit the protections of the statute to a specific class of people.  Unless\n14 the State Legislature amends Section 4030, its applicability is limited by its terms only to\n15 prearraignment detainees โ which were undisputedly never searched in a group setting while in\n16 KCSO custody.  See Wynn v. Natโl Broadcasting Co., 234 F.Supp.2d 1067, 1112 n.37 (C.D. Cal.\n17 2002) (โIn the context of statutory construction, a courtโs goal is to discern the apparent legislative\n18 intent, not to adopt a judicial construction to give that provision the meaning the court might believe\n19 most salutary.โ) (citations omitted). \n20 Thus, Plaintiffsโ Equal Protection Clause claim as to persons alleging group strip searches\n21 must fail and Defendants request that their motion in this regard be granted.\n22 VII.\n23 PLAINTIFFSโ STATE LAW CLAIMS FAIL AS A MATTER OF LAW\n24 Plaintiffs must demonstrate an underlying violation of state or federal law in order to prevail\n25 on their claims for violation of California Civil Code section 52.1.  See Cal.Civ.Code ยง52.1.  As set\n26 forth throughout this Motion, Plaintiffs cannot establish an underlying violation of a constitutional\n27 right and/or Penal Code section 4030.  Therefore, Defendants respectfully submit that there is no\n28 evidence to establish a violation of California Civil Code section 52.1 and, therefore, respectfully\nP O R T E R  *  S C O T T\nATTORNEYS\n350 UNIVERSITY AVE., SUITE 200\nSACRAMENTO, CA 95825 MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY ADJUDICATION\nTEL: 916. 929.1481\nwFwAwX.p: o9r1t6e.r 9s2c7o.t3t7.c0o6m 00597684.WPD 16\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 37    Filed 07/17/08   Page 22 of 22\n1 request that the court enter judgment as a matter of law on the claims arising out of California Civil\n2 Code section 52.1 with respect to the group search putative class.\n3 In addition, for the same reasons that Plaintiffsโ group search-related claims fail under the\n4 federal constitution, they also fail under the California Constitution. See Kasky v. Nike, Inc., 27 Cal.\n5 4th 939, 969 (2002) (in claims asserted under the California Constitution, however, the California\n6 Supreme Court often uses the analysis framed by the United States Supreme Court in interpretation\n7 of analogous provisions of the federal constitution).  Thus, Plaintiffsโ judgment should be granted\n8 to Defendants with respect to the group search claims asserted under the California Constitution, as\n9 well. \n10 VIII.\n11 CONCLUSION\n12 Based on the foregoing, Defendants SHERIFF DONNY YOUNGBLOOD, FORMER\n13 SHERIFF MACK WIMBISH, COUNTY OF KERN and KERN COUNTY SHERIFFโS OFFICE\n14 respectfully request that their joint Motion for Summary Adjudication of the federal claims\n15 pertaining to persons alleging group strip searches while in KCSO custody be granted.\n16 Respectfully submitted,\n17 Dated:  July 17, 2008 PORTER SCOTT\nA PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION\n18\n19 By   /s/ Terence J.

INTRODUCTION\n2 1.This action concerns the manner in which prisoners are searched in Kern Countyโs\n3 jails, alleging, inter alia, violations of the Fourth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of\n4 the United States Constitution and their corollaries under the California Constitution.  \n5 2. The gravamen of this complaint concerns the privacy rights of prisoners, who are\n6\nroutinely subjected to strip searches in violation of the Constitutions and laws of the United\n7\nStates and the State of California.\n8\nII. JURISDICTION AND VENUE\n9\n3. Plaintiff presents federal claims for relief under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.

Accordingly, supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims\n13\nis conferred upon this Court by 28 U.S.C. ยง 1367.\n14\n4. Plaintiffโs claims arise out of acts of the Kern County Sheriffโs Department in the\n15\nCounty of Kern, State of California, in and about Bakersfield, California.  Accordingly,\n16\nvenue is proper within the Eastern District of California.\n17\nIII. PARTIES\n18\nPlaintiff\n19\n5. Plaintiff Marsial Lopez, a male, is and was at all times relevant hereto, a resident\n20\nof the County of Kern.\n21\nDefendants\n22\n6. Defendant County of Kern (โCountyโ) is a public entity organized and existing\n23\nunder the laws of the State of California.  Defendant Kern County Sheriffโs Department\n24\n(โKCSDโ) is a public entity within the meaning of California law, and is a County agency.\n25\n26 These defendants are sued in their own right for a County and/or KCSD policy, practice\n27 or custom which caused plaintiffโs injuries in violation of one or more federal constitutional\n28 guarantees, and on plaintiffโs state law claims based on respondeat superior, under\n-2-\n00019046.WPD\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 1    Filed 03/27/07   Page 3 of 14\n1 California Government Code ยง 815.2 and mandatory duties under California Government\n2 Code ยง 815.6.\n3 7. Defendant Donny Youngblood (โYoungbloodโ) is the Sheriff of Kern County, and\n4 is the policy maker for the KCSD. He is sued in his official and individual capacities.\n5 8. Defendant Mack Wimbish (โWimbishโ) is the former sheriff for Kern County, and\n6\nis Youngbloodโs predecessor. Plaintiff sues Wimbish in his individual capacity only. \n7\n9. Plaintiff is ignorant of the true names and capacities of defendants sued herein as\n8\nDOES 1 through 100, inclusive, and therefore sues these defendants by such fictitious\n9\nnames. Plaintiff will give notice of this complaint, and of one of more DOESโ true names\n10\nand capacities, when ascertained. Plaintiff is informed and believe and based thereon\n11\nalleges, that defendants DOES 1 through 100 are responsible in some manner for the\n12\ndamages and injuries hereinafter complained of.\n13\n10.  DOES  1-50  (hereinafter  collectively  referred  to  as  โKCSD  Supervisory\n14\ndefendantsโ) were and are now responsible for the KCSD jails and, among other things, are\n15\nresponsible for the training, supervision, control, assignment and discipline of the sworn\n16\nand civilian personnel of the KCSD and County who work in, operate, administer and\n17\nmanage  the  jails,  and  for  the  formulation,  promulgation,  adoption,  application,\n18\nadministration and enforcement of the policies, rules, regulations and practices of the\n19\nKCSD jails.\n20\n11. Upon information and belief, plaintiff further alleges that, at all times relevant\n21\nherein, the KCSD Supervisory defendants participated in, approved, and/or ratified the\n22\nunconstitutional or illegal acts complained of herein that occurred within KCSD jails.\n23\n12. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges that, at all times relevant\n24\nherein,  the  individual  defendants,  and  each  of  them,  were  the  agents,  servants  and\n25\n26 employees of their respective employers (defendants KCSD, County) and were acting at\n27 all times within the scope of their agency and employment, and with the knowledge and\n28 consent of their principals and employers. At all times herein, defendants, and each of them,\n-3-\n00019046.WPD\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 1    Filed 03/27/07   Page 4 of 14\n1 were acting under the color of state law.\n2 IV. CLAIMS OF CLASS REPRESENTATIVE \n3 13. On or about late June 2005, plaintiff surrendered himself to out-of-state law\n4 enforcement officers upon learning that there was a Kern County felony warrant for his\n5 arrest, for charges filed in the Kern County Superior Court. Thereafter, plaintiff was\n6\nincarcerated in the Kern County jails, commencing late June 2005 and continuing until the\n7\nfirst week of November, 2007.\n8\n14. During his incarceration in the Kern County jails, KCSD deputies transported\n9\nplaintiff to and from the Kern County Superior Court for appearances on plaintiffโs then\n10\npending criminal case. Whenever plaintiff was transported between jail facilities, and when\n11\nhe was returned to jail from superior court, plaintiff was subjected to intrusive visual body\n12\ncavity/strip searches. That is, in the presence of others not necessary for the searches and\n13\nwithout any privacy, plaintiff was forced to remove all his clothing, expose his body\n14\ncavities in the presence of other persons, in unsanitary conditions.\n15\n15. On or about November 6, 2007, plaintiff, still incarcerated in the Kern County\n16\njail and awaiting a retrial (in his first trial the jury deadlocked 11-1, in favor of acquittal)\n17\nwas taken before the Kern County Superior Court. At that time the prosecuting authority\n18\ndismissed all criminal charges against plaintiff. The prosecutor dismissed the charges\n19\nbecause the prosecutorโs office finally decided to test DNA found on clothing recovered\n20\nfrom the crime scene. The DNA test results excluded plaintiff as the perpetrator of the\n21\ncharged crimes.\n22\n16. After the charges were dismissed, the superior court ordered plaintiffโs release.\n23\nAt that point KCSD deputies returned plaintiff to the Kern County jail for the sole purpose\n24\nof processing his release from custody. Upon arrival at the jail, plaintiff was subjected to\n25\n26 an illegal and intrusive visual body cavity/strip search, in unsanitary conditions, without\n27 privacy, and without reasonable suspicion that plaintiff possessed contraband or weapon(s).\n28 The search took place in the presence of persons not necessary for the search, forcing\n-4-\n00019046.WPD\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 1    Filed 03/27/07   Page 5 of 14\n1 plaintiff to expose his body cavities in the presence of other persons, without privacy, and\n2 in unsanitary conditions.\n3 17. Plaintiff has timely filed a claim under Government Code ยง 910 with the County\n4 of Kern, both on behalf of himself and other persons similarly situated.\n5 V. CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS\n6\n18. Plaintiff brings this action on his own behalf, and on behalf of a class of all other\n7\npersons similarly situated, pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The\n8\nclass is defined as those persons who, in the two years preceding the filing of this action,\n9\nand up until the date of class certification, or such other date as the Court may set,  were\n10\nforced to undergo unlawful strip and/or visual body cavity searches in Kern Countyโs jails\n11\nwhich are operated, maintained and under the control of the County, the KCSD and the\n12\nSupervisory defendants.\n13\n19. On information and belief, plaintiff alleges the strip and/or visual body cavity\n14\nsearches to which he and class members were subjected, were done pursuant to defendantsโ\n15\npolicy and practice to indiscriminately search all or a large number of persons being\n16\nprocessed into the jail without regard to: a) The nature of their offense or criminal history;\n17\nb) Whether they are under an order of release or not; c) Whether they have had contact\n18\nwith any persons from outside the County jail system who could reasonably be believed to\n19\nbe a potential source of contraband or weapons; d) Whether there is cause of any kind to\n20\nbelieve they are a potential source of contraband or weapons; e) Whether there is any other\n21\narticulable justification for defendantsโ indiscriminate strip and body search policy; or f)\n22\nWhether they are โprearraignment detainees,โ as that term is used in California Penal Code\n23\nยง 4030(b).\n24\n20. On information and belief, plaintiff alleges that defendants have a policy of not\n25\n26 limiting the persons who can see or hear or observe all or part of the strip and body cavity\n27 searches to those who are necessary to the procedure. Thus, other inmates, members of the\n28 opposite six, dispensable jail personnel and possibly others are able to see or hear some or\n-5-\n00019046.WPD\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 1    Filed 03/27/07   Page 6 of 14\n1 all of the searches described below.  Specifically, class members are required to submit to\n2 strip searches during which other people, who are not participating in the search and\n3 possibly are of the opposite sex, including jail staff and other inmates, are able to observe\n4 the search and the class membersโ naked bodies.  In many instances, class members are\n5 forced to touch each otherโs bodies during the searches.\n6\nVI. RULE 23 PREREQUISITES\n7\nA.  Numerosity\n8\n21. In accordance with F.R.Civ. P. Rule 23(a), the members of the class are so\n9\nnumerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. Plaintiff does not know the exact\n10\nnumber of class members. Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges that there\n11\nare more than 50 prisoners per day who are subjected to strip and/or body cavity searches\n12\nas a result of defendantsโ  policy and practice of indiscriminately subjecting prisoners to\n13\nstrip and body cavity searches. Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges that\n14\nthe number of persons in the proposed class is in the thousands.\n15\nB.  Common Issues of Fact or Law\n16\n22. In accordance with F.R. Civ. P. Rule 23(a), there are questions of fact common\n17\nto the class. Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges that the common\n18\nquestions of fact include, but are not limited to the following: (1) Whether the KCSD\n19\nroutinely subjects all prisoners to strip and/or body cavity searches without there being any\n20\nreasonable suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts, to believe any particular inmate\n21\nhas concealed drug(s), weapon(s) and/or any contraband on their persons or in their body\n22\ncavities; (2) Whether the strip and/or body cavity searches are conducted in an area of\n23\nprivacy so that the search cannot be observed by persons not participating in the search, or\n24\nwhether the strip and body cavity searches are conducted in areas where they may be\n25\n26 observed by persons not participating in the searches; and (3) Whether the strip and/or\n27 body cavity searches are conducted in an unsanitary area, infested with bacteria such as\n28 MRSA and other communicable diseases.\n-6-\n00019046.WPD\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 1    Filed 03/27/07   Page 7 of 14\n1 23. In accordance with F.R. Civ. P. Rule 23(a), there are questions of law common\n2 to the class.  Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges that the common\n3 questions of law include but are not limited to the following: (1) Whether the KCSD may\n4 indiscriminately conduct strip and/or body cavity searches of inmates without there being\n5 any reasonable suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts, to believe any particular\n6\ninmate has concealed drug(s), weapon(s) and/or any contraband on their persons or in their\n7\nbody cavities; (2) Whether the KCSD may conduct strip and/or body cavity searches of\n8\ninmates in open areas where they may be observed by persons not participating in the\n9\nsearches; (3) Whether KCSDโs policy of subjecting persons to strip and/or body cavity\n10\nsearches violates California Penal Code ยง 4030; (4) Whether KCSDโs policy of subjecting\n11\npersons to strip and/or body cavity searches in an area which is not an โarea of privacyโ\n12\nviolates California Penal Code ยง 4030(m); (5) Whether the conduct described above\n13\nviolates the Fourth and/or Fourteenth Amendments, and/or California Constitution Article\n14\nI, sections 1, 7, and/or 13; (6) Whether the conduct described above constitutes a policy\n15\nor custom of the defendants; (7) Whether any individual defendant is entitled to qualified\n16\nimmunity on the federal claims, or state law immunity on the state law claims, for the\n17\npractices complained of herein; and (8) Whether determination of damages suffered by a\n18\nstatistically representative sample of the class provides the basis for determination of all\n19\nclass membersโ damages except those who opt out.\n20\nC.  Typicality\n21\n24. In accordance with F.R. Civ. P. Rule 23(a), the claims of the representative\n22\nPlaintiff are typical of the class. Plaintiff was in KCSD custody when he was subjected to\n23\nat least one strip and/or visual body cavity searches without there being any reasonable\n24\nsuspicion, based on specific or articulable facts, to believe that plaintiff and class members\n25\n26 had concealed drug(s), weapon(s) and/or any contraband in their body cavities; plaintiff\n27 was subjected to searches in open areas where they were observed by other prisoners and\n28 persons not involved in the search, possibly including sometimes members of the opposite\n-7-\n00019046.WPD\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 1    Filed 03/27/07   Page 8 of 14\n1 sex; plaintiff was searched and forced to stand naked in unsanitary and bacteria infested\n2 areas.\n3 25. Thus, plaintiff has the same interests and have suffered the same type of damages\n4 as the class members. Plaintiffโs claims are based upon the same or similar legal theories\n5 as the claims of the class members. Each class member suffered actual damages as a result\n6\nof being subjected to a strip and/or body cavity search. The actual damages suffered by\n7\nplaintiff are similar in type and amount to the actual damages suffered by each class\n8\nmember.\n9\n26. In accordance with F.R. Civ. P. Rule 23(a), the representative plaintiff will fairly\n10\nand adequately protect the interests of the class. The interests of the representative plaintiff\n11\nare consistent with and not antagonistic to the interests of the class.\n12\n  D.  Maintenance and Superiority\n13\n27. In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(1)(A), prosecutions of separate\n14\nactions by individual members of the class would create a risk that inconsistent or varying\n15\nadjudications with respect to individual members of the class would establish incompatible\n16\nstandards of conduct for the parties opposing the class.\n17\n28. In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(1)(B), prosecutions of separate\n18\nactions by individual members of the class would create a risk of adjudications with respect\n19\nto individual members of the class which would, as a practical matter, substantially impair\n20\nor impede the interests of the other members of the class to protect their interests.\n21\n29. In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(2), plaintiff is informed and believes\n22\nand thereon alleges that the defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable to the\n23\nclass.\n24\n30. In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(3), the questions of law or fact\n25\n26 common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only\n27 individual members, and this class action is superior to other available methods for the fair\n28 and efficient adjudication of the controversy between the parties.  Plaintiff is informed and\n-8-\n00019046.WPD\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 1    Filed 03/27/07   Page 9 of 14\n1 believes and thereon alleges that the interest of class members in individually controlling\n2 the prosecution of a separate action is low, in that most class members would be unable to\n3 individually prosecute any action at all.  Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon\n4 alleges that the amounts at stake for individuals are such that separate suits would be\n5 impracticable in that most members of the class will not be able to find counsel to represent\n6\nthem.  Plaintiff  is  informed  and  believes  and  thereon  alleges  that  it  is  desirable  to\n7\nconcentrate all litigation in one forum because all of the claims arise in the same location,\n8\ni.e., the County of Kern, and it will promote judicial efficiency to resolve the common\n9\nquestions of law and fact in one forum, rather than in multiple courts.\n10\n31. Plaintiff does not know the identities of the class members. Plaintiff is informed\n11\nand believe and thereon allege that the identities of the class members are ascertainable\n12\nfrom KCSD records, in particular the KCSD computer system used to track and identify\n13\nKCSD inmates. Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges that the computer\n14\nsystem reflects the identities, including addresses and telephone numbers, of the persons\n15\nwho have been held in custody by KCSD; when inmates were arrested and booked, taken\n16\nto court, returned from court; why inmates were released; and when inmates were released.\n17\n32. Plaintiff knows of no difficulty that will be encountered in the management of\n18\nthis litigation that would preclude its maintenance as a class action.  The class action is\n19\nsuperior to any other available means to resolve the issues raised on behalf of the class.\n20\nThe class action will be manageable because so many different records systems exist from\n21\nwhich to ascertain the members of the class. Liability can be determined on a class-wide\n22\nbasis. Damages can be determined on a class-wide basis using a damages matrix set by a\n23\njury, or by trying the damages of a statistically valid sample of the class to a jury and\n24\nextrapolating those damages to the class as a whole.\n25\n26 33. In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(3), class members must be furnished\n27 with the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including individual notice to all\n28 members who can be identified through reasonable effort.  Plaintiff is informed and believes\n-9-\n00019046.WPD\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 1    Filed 03/27/07   Page 10 of 14\n1 that KCSD computer records contain a last known address for class members.  Plaintiff\n2 contemplates that individual notice be given to class members at such last known address\n3 by first class mail. Plaintiff contemplates that the notice inform class members of the\n4 following:\n5 A. The pendency of the class action, and the issues common to the class;\n6\nB. The nature of the action;\n7\nC. Their right to โopt outโ of the action within a given time, in which event\n8\nthey will not be bound by a decision rendered in the class action;\n9\nD. Their right, if they do not โopt out,โ to be represented by their own counsel\n10\nand enter an appearance in the case; otherwise, they will be represented by the\n11\nnamed plaintiff and his counsel; and\n12\nE. Their right, if they do not โopt out,โ to share in any recovery in favor of the\n13\nclass, and conversely to be bound by any judgment on the common issues, adverse\n14\nto the class.\n15\n34. Plaintiff restates and incorporates by reference each of the forgoing paragraphs\n16\nin each of the following causes of action as if each paragraph was fully set forth therein.\n17\nCOUNT ONE - 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983\n18\n(All Defendants)\n19\n35.  In subjecting plaintiff and class members to the unnecessary, demeaning, and\n20\noutrageous intrusive strip and body cavity search, defendants, and each of them, violated\n21\nplaintiffโs and class membersโ  rights to be secure in their persons against unreasonable\n22\nsearches and seizures as guaranteed by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the\n23\nUnited States Constitution. Therefore, plaintiff and class members are entitled to bring suit\n24\nand recover damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.\n25\n26 COUNT TWO - EQUAL PROTECTION\n27 (All Defendants)\n28 36.  The unnecessary, demeaning, and outrageous intrusive strip and body cavity\n-10-\n00019046.WPD\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 1    Filed 03/27/07   Page 11 of 14\n1 search deprived plaintiff and class members of the protections afforded by provisions of the\n2 14th Amendment Equal Protection guarantees. Therefore, plaintiff and class members are\n3 entitled to bring suit and recover damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.\n4 COUNT THREE - Cal. Const., Art. I ยงยง 7, 13\n5 (All Defendants)\n6\n37.  The unnecessary, demeaning, outrageous, and intrusive strip and body cavity\n7\nsearch to which plaintiff and class members were subjected violated plaintiffโs rights not\n8\nto be denied equal protection of the law, as guaranteed by Article I, ยง 7 of the California\n9\nConstitution; and to be secure in their persons against unreasonable searches and seizures,\n10\nas guaranteed by Article I, ยง 13 of the California Constitution.\n11\nCOUNT FOUR - Cal. Civ. Code ยง 52.1\n12\n(All Defendants)\n13\n38. The unnecessary, demeaning, and outrageous intrusive strip and/or visual body\n14\ncavities were accomplished via coercion and/or threats of coercion.\n15\n39. The unnecessary, demeaning, and outrageous intrusive strip and visual body\n16\ncavity searches deprived plaintiff and the class he represent of the protections afforded by\n17\nprovisions of federal constitutional and state constitutional and statutory law, including but\n18\nnot limited to rights protected under the Fourth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the\n19\nUnited  States  Constitution;  Article  I,  ยงยง  1,  7,  13,  and  17,  of  the  California  state\n20\nconstitution, and California Penal Code ยง 4030.  Therefore, plaintiff and the class are\n21\nentitled to bring suit and recover damages pursuant to Cal. Civ. Code ยง 52.1(b).\n22\n40. As a direct and proximate cause of the aforementioned acts, plaintiff and class\n23\nmembers were damaged in an amount to be proven at trial but in any event not less than\n24\n$4,000 per violation pursuant to the provisions of Civil Code ยง 52(b).\n25\n26 41.  The aforementioned acts of defendants directly and proximately caused plaintiff\n27 to be deprived of her California constitutional rights as stated above, thereby entitling\n28 plaintiff and class members to recover damages proximately caused by defendantsโ\n-11-\n00019046.WPD\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 1    Filed 03/27/07   Page 12 of 14\n1 wrongful acts.\n2 COUNT FIVE Violation of Statutory Duties\n3 (Penal Code ยง 4030)\n4 (Against Defendants County and KCSD Only)\n5 42.The unnecessary, demeaning, outrageous, and intrusive strip and body cavity\n6\nsearches, to which plaintiff and the claim members were subjected by defendants, violated\n7\nplaintiffโs and the class membersโ state-law protections guaranteed by California Penal\n8\nCode ยง 4030.\n9\n43. Any violation of a California statute is mandatory and prohibitory.\n10\n44. The aforementioned acts of defendants directly and proximately caused the\n11\nplaintiff and the class members to be deprived of their rights as stated above, thereby\n12\nentitling plaintiff and class members to recover damages proximately caused by defendantsโ\n13\nwrongful acts, including statutory damages under Penal Code ยง 4030.\n14\nCOUNT SIX- Violation of Mandatory Duties\n15\n(Against Defendants County and KCSD)\n16\n45.

These constitutional provisions and statutes apply to all members of the general\n21\npublic, including Plaintiff, and were all designed to prevent the kind of injuries alleged\n22\nherein.\n23\n47. Defendants did not exercise reasonable diligence in discharging their duty to\n24\nrefrain from violating the constitutional rights of plaintiff and class members.\n25\n26 48. As a direct and proximate cause of the aforementioned acts of defendants,\n27 plaintiff and class members were damaged in amounts to be determined at trial.\n28 ///\n-12-\n00019046.WPD\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 1    Filed 03/27/07   Page 13 of 14\n1 VII.

Summary\n3 The plaintiffs allege that during the period from March 27, 2005 up to October 1,\n4 2007, they, and other inmates housed by the Kern County Sheriffโs Office (โKCSOโ) were\n5 subjected to strip searches that were conducted unlawfully but according to official policy.\n6 Thurston Dec ยถ 2. In counter motions for summary adjudication/judgment, the parties\n7 addressed the most significant class issues raised by the complaint.  Id. at ยถ 3.\n8 The plaintiffs challenge two portions of the KCSO โstrip searchโ policy and its customs\n9 in implementing it.  They assert that the KCSOโ s policy and its custom was unconstitutional\n10 because it allowed inmates to be searched in view of other inmates who were also\n11 undergoing search.  Likewise, they contend that the policy and custom was unlawful\n12 because it allowed inmates, who had been ordered โreleasedโ at their most recent court\n13 appearance, to be strip searched while awaiting confirmation of whether they were, in fact,\n14 eligible for release.\n15 In ruling on the motions, the Court denied  Eleventh Amendment immunity to Sheriff\n16 Donny Youngblood and former Sheriff Mack Wimbish as to all federal law issues.  Thurston\n17 Dec ยถ 4.  These defendants are filing notices of appeal as to this final judgment at the same\n18 time as the filing of this motion.  Puerto Rico Aqueduct & Sewer Authority v. Metcalf & Eddy,\n19 Inc.,  506  U.S.  139,  144  [Denial  of  Eleventh  Amendment  immunity  is  immediately\n20 appealable.].  In addition, the Court determined that the County of Kern could be held liable\n21 for the strip search policy adopted by the KCSO and determined that searching inmates in\n22 groups and after they had been ordered released was unconstitutional. Id. at ยถ 5.\n23 In this motion, the defendants (hereafter โCountyโ) seek entry of judgment on the\n24 claim that it may be held liable under 42 USC ยง 1983 for the policies or customs of the\n25 KCSO described above.  Thurston Dec ยถยถ 5-6.  County contends that this issue is\n26 inextricably intertwined with the individualsโ entitlement to the protections of Eleventh\n27 Amendment immunity and certifying this issue for appeal serves judicial economy and\n28\nMemorandum of Points & Authorities in Support of Rule 54 Certification Motion and Request for Stay\n2\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 94-1    Filed 04/28/09   Page 3 of 12\n1 prevents piecemeal appeal.  This issue forms the basis for the Courtโs determination of\n2 Countyโs liability as to all claims raised under 42 U.S.C ยง 1983 and, to that extent, County\n3 seeks to settle this issue now.1\n4 In addition, County seeks entry of judgment on the Courtโs determination that\n5 searching inmates in groups was unconstitutional.  Thurston Dec ยถ 6.  County argues here\n6 that this is a central issue in the litigation and raises an important issue of law such that\n7 appellate review should not be delayed.  Therefore, County seeks certification of the  order\n8 granting plaintiffsโ motion for summary adjudication related to liability under the Fourth\n9 Amendment to the United States Constitution and under Article I, section 1of the California\n10 Constitution and the denial of Countyโs motion for summary adjudication on the alleged\n11 violation of California Civil Code section 52.1 as it relates to the group strip search issue.\n12 Id. at ยถ 5.\n13 Finally, County requests the Court stay the remaining and undetermined portions of\n14 the matter until completion of the appellate process.\n15 II.  The Court has the Authority to Certify for Appeal the Specified Claims\n16 Federal Rules of Civil Procedure rule 54, subdivision (b) vests the Court with the\n17 authority to enter judgment if there is no just reason for delay.  This rule provides in pertinent\n18 part,\n19 When an action presents more than one claim for relief . . . or when multiple\nparties are involved, the court may direct entry of a final judgment as to one\n20 or more, but fewer than all, claims or parties only if the court expressly\ndetermines that there is no just reason for delay. \n21\nId.  In Continental Airlines, Inc., v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 819 F.2d 1519, 1525 (9th\n22\nCir. 1987) the Court held, \n23\nDistinguishing \"claims\" from theories of recovery for purposes of Rule 54(b)\n24 has occasioned a good deal of subtle jurisprudence. A claim, it is true, is less\n25\n1At this time, County does not challenge the substance of the Courtโs determination\n26\nthat strip searching court โreleaseesโ is unconstitutional.  Thurston Dec ยถ 5.  It does seek to\n27 challenge whether the County of Kern can be held liable for this KCSO policy/custom. Id.\nat ยถ 5.\n28\nMemorandum of Points & Authorities in Support of Rule 54 Certification Motion and Request for Stay\n3\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 94-1    Filed 04/28/09   Page 4 of 12\n1 than the central object of a lawsuit and surely more than merely one element\nof proof offered in support of a complaint seeking money damages. But the\n2 essence eludes the grasp like quicksilver. We agree with Judge Wisdom that\nthe solution for Rule 54(b) purposes lies in a more pragmatic approach\n3 focusing on severability and efficient judicial administration.\n4 The Court decided that even though the final rulings below โeliminated none of the parties\n5 and left open potentially full recovery in both of Continental's ultimate areas of loss,โ\n6 certifying the issues for appeal was proper given that it streamlined the action and narrowed\n7 the issues.  Id.\n8 For the reasons set forth below, County contends that there is no just reason to delay\n9 entry of judgment on the issues identified which will allow immediate appellate review at the\n10 same time as the individualsโ appeal related to denial of Eleventh Amendment immunity.\n11 A.  A โfinalโ judgment has been issued regarding Countyโs liability under 42\n12 USC ยง 1983 and as to the lawfulness of searching inmates in groups. \n13 In determining a Rule 54 certification motion, the Court must determine first whether\n14 a โfinalโ judgment exists. In Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. General Elec. Co., 446 U.S. 1, 7 (1980)\n15 the court held that for a judgment to be considered โfinalโ for Rule 54 certification purposes,\n16 โIt must be a \"judgment\" in the sense that it is a decision upon a cognizable claim for relief,\n17 and it must be \"final\" in the sense that it is \"an ultimate disposition of an individual claim\n18 entered in the course of a multiple claims action.โ\n19 i.  Whether the Sheriff is a policymaker for the County of Kern is a\n20 โclaimโ upon which the Court has made a final determination.\n21 Whether County is liable for the policies of the KCSO involves analysis of the\n22 relationship between the Kern County Board of Supervisors and the Sheriff and the\n23 relationship between the Attorney General and the Sheriff as well as other relationships.  It\n24 requires evaluation of a discrete set of state law and other legal authorities and appears to\n25 be a pure question of law.  Thurston Dec ยถ 9. Thus, this issue is a โclaimโ for purposes of\n26 Rule 54 certification.\n27 Moreover, the Court has determined that County is liable for the policies of the KCSO\n28\nMemorandum of Points & Authorities in Support of Rule 54 Certification Motion and Request for Stay\n4\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 94-1    Filed 04/28/09   Page 5 of 12\n1 related to strip searches of inmates.  Thurston Dec ยถ 5. Likewise, it has determined that\n2 these KCSO policies were unconstitutional.  Id. at ยถยถ 5-6.  There are no remaining questions\n3 related to liability on this topic.  Thus, the Courtโs ruling is a final disposition of the issue of\n4 Countyโs responsibility for the KCSO policies and is appropriate for Rule 54 certification.\n5 This issue is intertwined with the Courtโs denial of Eleventh Amendment immunity\n6 about which Youngblood and Wimbish are seeking appellate review.  Thurston Dec ยถ 7.\n7 Judicial economy dictates that the entirety of the issue be decided on appeal now rather\n8 than in a piecemeal fashion.  For example, Countyโs intention is to appeal the issue of its\n9 liability for the KCSO policies when operating the jail at the entry of judgment, whether this\n10 occurs now or in the future. Id. at ยถ 7.  On the other hand, addressing this issue on appeal\n11 now would assist in the possibility of settlement because, no matter how Countyโs appeal\n12 is decided, it would assist in clarifying the availability of insurance coverage. Id. at ยถ 8.\n13 ii.  Whether the policy of strip searching inmates in groups was\n14 unconstitutional is a โclaimโ upon which the Court has made a\n15 final determination.\n16 The set of facts regarding strip searches of inmates in groups is discrete from the\n17 issues remaining in the case that have not yet been determined.  Thurston Dec ยถ 9. It is\n18 discrete also from the determination that strip searching court โreleaseesโ is unconstitutional\n19 both legally and factually. Id. Instead, appellate review of the lawfulness of strip searching\n20 inmates in groups involves a pure question of law.2  Id. Thus, this issue is a โclaimโ for\n21 purposes of Rule 54 certification.  \n22 The fact that the plaintiffs relied upon this manner of searching as support for several\n23 different causes of action does not militate against finding that the issue is a claim for\n24 purposes of Rule 54 certification.  Instead, a โclaimโ โrefers to a set of facts giving rise to\n25 legal rights in the claimant, not to legal theories of recovery based upon those facts.โ CMAX,\n26\n27 2This is true because the defendants do not deny the content of the policy, how it was\nimplemented or how and when strip searches were conducted as this relates to this issue.\n28\nMemorandum of Points & Authorities in Support of Rule 54 Certification Motion and Request for Stay\n5\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 94-1    Filed 04/28/09   Page 6 of 12\n1 Inc. v. Drewry Photocolor Corp., 295 F.2d 695, 697 (9th Cir. 1961) The Court in CMAX Inc.\n2 warned, โIt does not seem to us to be good judicial administration, or a reasonable\n3 construction of Rule 54(b), to have both this court and the district court simultaneously\n4 passing upon what is in substance the identical claim, we dealing with one theory, but\n5 basically the same facts, under the second count, and the district court dealing with another\n6 other theory, but basically the same facts, under the first count.โ  Id.  Thus only where\n7 factual questions overlap with issues not on appeal are courts reluctant to grant certification.\n8 The Courtโs ruling determining that the defendantsโ action in strip searching inmates\n9 in groups was unlawful, is a final determination which makes the entity liable in this case.3\n10 Thurston Dec ยถยถ 5-6. Therefore, this determination is of a โclaimโ in the lawsuit.  As a result,\n11 the entity seeks certification of the โgroup strip search claimโ that includes the Courtโs ruling\n12 that  strip  searching  in  groups  violated  the  Fourth  Amendment  to  the  United  States\n13 Constitution.  Id. at ยถ 6.  As  to the individual defendants and the entity, the defendants seek\n14 certification of the Courtโs ruling that strip searching in groups violated Article I, Section 1 of\n15 the California Constitution and that it forms an underlying basis for liability under California\n16 Civil Code section 52.1. Id.\n17 B. There is no just reason to delay appeal of the identified issues.\n18 The second step in determining the Rule 54 certification motion requires the Court\n19 to evaluate whether there are just reasons to delay the appeal.  Curtiss-Wright Corp. v.\n20 General Elec. Co., supra, 446 U.S. at 8.  The Court is required to โtake into account judicial\n21 administrative interests as well as the equities involvedโ and, in doing so, consider such\n22 factors as whether โthe claims under review were separable from the others remaining to be\n23 adjudicated and whether the nature of the claims already determined was such that no\n24 appellate court would have to decide the same issues more than once even if there were\n25 subsequent appeals.โ Id.  One of the most important factors the Court is required to evaluate\n26 is the โinterrelationship of the claims so as to prevent piecemeal appeals.โ  Id. at 10.\n27\n3Youngblood and Wimbish were granted qualified immunity on this topic.\n28\nMemorandum of Points & Authorities in Support of Rule 54 Certification Motion and Request for Stay\n6\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 94-1    Filed 04/28/09   Page 7 of 12\n1 However,  if  the  Court  finds  โa  sufficiently  important  reason  for  nonetheless  granting\n2 certification,โ that one of the factors mitigates against granting the certification motion is not\n3 determinative.  Id. at n. 2.\n4 In General Acquisition, Inc. v. Gencorp, Inc., 23 F.3d 1022, 1030 (9th Cir. 1994), the\n5 Court held that there is no โprecise testโ for determining if just cause exists to delay the\n6 appeal.  However, the Court articulated a โnonexhaustive list of factors which a district court\n7 should consider when making a Rule 54(b) determination.\"  Id. The Court identified the\n8 suggested factors to consider as,\n9 (1) the relationship between the adjudicated and unadjudicated claims; (2) the\npossibility that the need for review might or might not be mooted by future\n10 developments in the district court; (3) the possibility that the reviewing court\nmight be obliged to consider the same issue a second time; (4) the presence\n11 or absence of a claim or counterclaim which could result in set-off against the\njudgment sought to be made final; (5) miscellaneous factors such as delay,\n12 economic and solvency considerations, shortening the time of trial, frivolity of\ncompeting claims, expense and the like.\n13\n14 Id.   โRule 54(b) certification is proper if it will aid โexpeditious decisionโ of the case. [Citation]\n15 โThe Rule 54(b) claims do not have to be separate from and independent of the remaining\n16 claims.โ [Citation] However, Rule 54(b) certification is scrutinized to 'prevent piecemeal\n17 appeals in cases which should be reviewed only as single units.'\"  Texaco, Inc. v. Ponsoldt,\n18 939 F.2d 794, 797 (9th Cir. 1991). \n19 As noted above, there is no factual or legal relationship between the matters not\n20 decided by the Court or the issue of strip searching court โreleaseesโ and those issues\n21 sought to be appealed.  Thurston Dec ยถ 10. Likewise, no development in the trial court,\n22 outside of sua sponte reversal of the orders by the Court, will moot the need for appellate\n23 review of the identified issues.  Id. at ยถ 10. However, decisions on the appealed issues could\n24 streamline the trial on the remaining issues.  Id. For example, each plaintiff alleges claims\n25 against the entity and the individuals.  Id. Thus, a determination that the Sheriff acted for the\n26 state, rather than the County, would preclude further litigation.  Id. Likewise, a determination\n27 that strip searching inmates in groups was lawful would effectively cut the lawsuit in half but,\n28\nMemorandum of Points & Authorities in Support of Rule 54 Certification Motion and Request for Stay\n7\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 94-1    Filed 04/28/09   Page 8 of 12\n1 in terms of prospective class members, it would reduce the size to a mere fraction of those\n2 that would otherwise be class members. Id. at ยถยถ 10-11.\n3 The trial, when held, could be greatly shortened by the appeal because if County is\n4 successful, the number of plaintiffs would be significantly reduced and there would be fewer\n5 issues to determine.  Thurston Dec ยถยถ 10-11. This, in turn, would reduce the amount of time\n6 the Court would require to spend and the amount of time the parties would spend in\n7 discovery and would preserve the economic resources of the Court and the parties.  Id.\n8 Resources would be preserved also because the need for notifying prospective members\n9 of the group strip search class could be rendered unnecessary depending upon the results\n10 on appeal.  Id.\n11 Finally, because the matter is being appealed by Youngblood and Wimbish as of\n12 right, there seems little justification for failing to obtain an appellate determination as to all\n13 ripe issues at this time.  Thurston Dec ยถ 4. Because the issues are distinct from those not\n14 appealed or determined, the Court of Appeals would not decide the same issue more than\n15 once.  Id. at ยถยถ 4, 7-8.  Therefore, based upon the factors announced in General Acquisition,\n16 Inc. v. Gencorp, County requests the Court certify the following claims:\n17 1.  The claim that the County of Kern may be held liable under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983\n18 for the policies of the Sheriff as they relate to operation of the jail;\n19 2.  The claim that strip searching inmates in groups is unlawful which includes the\n20 Courtโs ruling that strip searching in groups violated the Fourth Amendment\n21 to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 1 of the California\n22 Constitution and that it forms an underlying basis for liability under California\n23 Civil Code section 52.1.\n24 III.  The Claims at Issue are Justiciable \n25 A.  The Defendants Have Standing to Appeal\n26 The defendants here have standing to appeal because they were parties who\n27 participated in the proceedings below.  Thurston Dec ยถยถ 3-6. They are aggrieved by the\n28\nMemorandum of Points & Authorities in Support of Rule 54 Certification Motion and Request for Stay\n8\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 94-1    Filed 04/28/09   Page 9 of 12\n1 decision of the Court which determined that they are liable for conducting strip searches in\n2 groups and, in the case of the entity, that it is liable for the policies of the Sheriff when\n3 operating the jail. Id.; Hoover v. Switlik Parachute Co., 663 F.2d 964, 966 (9th Cir. 1981)\n4 [Determination of an issue of liability unfavorably to the defendant/appellant is sufficient to\n5 demonstrate standing to appeal.].\n6 B.  The Issues Have Not Become Moot\n7 County knows of no facts that have made moot the issues sought to be raised on\n8 appeal. Thurston Dec ยถ 10.\n9 C.  The Controversy is Ripe for Appeal\n10 The Court has made a final determination that the defendants are liable to classes\n11 of plaintiffs.  Thurston Dec ยถยถ 5-6. Thus, any opinion issued by the Court of Appeal would\n12 not be advisory but would determine an actual case and controversy. (Vieux v. E. Bay Reg'l\n13 Park Dist., 906 F.2d 1330, 1344 (9th Cir. 2003) [โThe ripeness doctrine prevents courts from\n14 deciding abstract issues that have not yet had a concrete impact on the parties.โ].\n15 IV.  Good Cause Exists to Stay the Non-Appealed Portions of the Case\n16 The Court has the inherent power to stay the case to allow the appeal to proceed. In\n17 CMAX, Inc. v. Drewry Photocolor Corp., supra, 295 F.2d at 268, the Court held,\n18 A district court has inherent power to control the disposition of the causes on\nits docket in a manner which will promote economy of time and effort for itself,\n19 for counsel, and for litigants. The exertion of this power calls for the exercise\nof a sound discretion.  Where it is proposed that a pending proceeding be\n20 stayed, the competing interests which will be affected by the granting or\nrefusal to grant a stay must be weighed. Among these competing interests are\n21 the possible damage which may result from the granting of a stay, the\nhardship or inequity which a party may suffer in being required to go forward,\n22 and the orderly course of justice measured in terms of the simplifying or\ncomplicating of issues, proof, and questions of law which could be expected\n23 to result from a stay.\n24 County contends that good cause exists to stay the proceedings as to those issues\n25 not subject to appellate review.  Thurston Dec ยถยถ 10-12. First, proceeding with the remainder\n26 of the case will be extremely costly and these costs could be determined to be unnecessary\n27 depending upon the outcome of the appeal. Id.  For example, notification of potential class\n28\nMemorandum of Points & Authorities in Support of Rule 54 Certification Motion and Request for Stay\n9\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 94-1    Filed 04/28/09   Page 10 of 12\n1 members will be very costly in terms of resources, time and money.  Id. However, should\n2 County succeed on appeal and it is determined that these defendants cannot be held liable,\n3 notification to the group strip search class will be unnecessary. Id.\n4 Second, if County does not succeed on appeal but notification to the โPost Release\n5 Classโ has occurred, re-notice to this class will be necessary because of their potential\n6 inclusion in the โGroup Strip Searchโ class also.  Thurston Dec ยถยถ 10-12. Not only is this a\n7 duplication of cost of resources, it is prejudicial in that it gives these prospective class\n8 members more than the one opportunity to join in or opt out of the class although\n9 prospective members of the other class will have only one opportunity.  Id.  Moreover, it will\n10 require  moving  forward  on  a  damage  determination  either  through  โmini-trialsโ  of\n11 representative plaintiffsโ cases and/or through negotiation without regard for the need for the\n12 same effort as to the other defined class. Id.\n13 Third, proceeding with the determination of the named plaintiffsโ claims is potentially\n14 wasteful of the Courtโs time because Countyโs appeal will challenge the primary bases upon\n15 which the plaintiffs rely for their assertions of liability.  Thurston Dec ยถยถ 10-12. In the event\n16 of success of the appeal, there is a significant probability of inconsistent determinations.  Id.\n17 Fourth, a stay will allow for the orderly administration of this case, is not sought for any\n18 improper purpose and the defendants know of no prejudice that will result thereby. Thurston\n19 Dec ยถ 12.\n20 V.  Conclusion\n21 For the reasons set forth, certification of the identified issues for purposes of appeal\n22 will serve the interests of judicial economy and will not pose the risk of piecemeal appeals\n23 and, in fact, will avoid the probability of piecemeal appeals. Therefore, County requests the\n24 Court grant the motion and certify the issues identified above for immediate appeal.\n25 ///\n26 ///\n27 ///\n28\nMemorandum of Points & Authorities in Support of Rule 54 Certification Motion and Request for Stay\n10\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 94-1    Filed 04/28/09   Page 11 of 12\n1 Likewise, ordering a stay of the action would avoid waste of resources and duplication\n2 of efforts and would allow for the orderly administration of the balance of the case.  Thus,\n3 County urges the Court to stay the proceedings to allow completion of the appeals.\n4\n5 Dated: April 28, 2009 OFFICE OF THE COUNTY COUNSEL\n6\n7 By      /s/ Jennifer L.

The matter was heard on June 26, 2009, before the\n20 Honorable Dennis L. Beck, United States Magistrate Judge.  Barrett Litt and Paul Estuar\n21 appeared telephonically on behalf of Plaintiffs.  Jennifer Thurston and Terence Cassidy appeared\n22 on behalf of Defendants.\n23 BACKGROUND\n24 Plaintiff Marsial Lopez, individually and as class representative, filed the instant civil\n25 rights action on March 27, 2007.  On June 21, 2007, Plaintiffs Marsial Lopez, Sandra Chavez,\n26 and Theodore Medina, individually and as class representatives, filed a First Amended\n27 Complaint (โFACโ) against Kern County, the Kern County Sheriffโs Department, Kern County\n28 Sheriff Donny Youngblood (officially and individually) and former Kern County Sheriff Mack\n1\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 114    Filed 07/01/09   Page 2 of 8\n1 Wimbish (individually).  Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief and damages resulting from the strip\n2 and/or visual body cavity searches of prisoners by the Kern County Sheriffโs Department. \n3 The FAC contains six causes of action:  (1) damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983\n4 premised on unreasonable searches and seizures in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth\n5 Amendments of the U.S. Constitution; (2) damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 premised on\n6 violation Fourteenth Amendment equal protection guarantees; (3) violation of their equal\n7 protection rights pursuant to Article I, ยง 7 of the California Constitution and unreasonable search\n8 and seizure in violation of Article I, ยง 13 of the California Constitution; (4) damages pursuant to\n9 California Civil Code ยง 52.1(b) and ยง 52(b) premised on violations of their rights under the\n10 Fourth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Article I, ยงยง 1, 7, 13 and 17 of the California\n11 Constitution, and California Penal Code ยง 4030; (5) violation of California Penal Code ยง 4030;\n12 and (6) violation of mandatory duties under California Government Code ยง 815.6. \n13 On March 31, 2009, the Court issued an order on the partiesโ cross motions for summary\n14 judgment.  In its Order, the Court: (1) granted Plaintiffs summary judgment/adjudication as to\n15 KCSOโs policy of group strip searching prisoners in violation of the Fourth Amendment; (2)\n16 granted Plaintiffs summary judgment/summary adjudication as to KCSOโs policy of strip\n17 searching persons ordered released from custody in violation of the Fourth Amendment; (3)\n18 granted Plaintiffsโ motion for partial summary judgment/summary adjudication regarding\n19 violation of California Constitution, Article I, Section 1; (4) denied without prejudice\n20 Defendantsโ motion for summary adjudication regarding Plaintiffsโ state law claims pursuant to\n21 California Civil Code section 52.1; (5) granted Defendantsโ motion for summary adjudication\n22 that Defendants Youngblood and Wimbish are entitled to qualified immunity regarding\n23 Plaintiffsโ Fourth Amendment claims specific to group strip searches; (6) denied Defendantsโ\n24 motion for summary adjudication that Defendants Youngblood and Wimbish are entitled to\n25 qualified immunity regarding the searches of detainees upon return from court appearances after\n26 they were ordered released; (7) denied Defendantsโ motion for summary adjudication against\n27 Plaintiffsโ causes of action for ยง 1983 claims on the ground that the Sheriffs are state actors and\n28\n2\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 114    Filed 07/01/09   Page 3 of 8\n1 are entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity; and (8) denied Defendantsโ motion for summary\n2 adjudication as to ยง 1983 claims asserted against the County.\n3 On April 1, 2009, the Court also granted Plaintiffsโ motion for class certification.  The\n4 Court certified the following classes:\n5   Post-Release Class: Persons who, from March 27, 2005, up to October 1, 2007, or the\ntime of judgment or settlement of the case: (a) were in KCSD custody; (b) were taken\n6 from jail to court; (c) became entitled to release after going to court; and (d) were strip\nand/or vbc searched before release pursuant to KCSDโs blanket policy, practice and/or\n7 custom to strip/vbc search all court returns, including those entitled to release.\n8 Group Strip Search Class: Persons who, from March 27, 2005, up to October 1, 2007, or\nthe time of judgment or settlement of the case: (a) were in KCSD custody; (b) were\n9 subjected to a strip and/or vbc search in a group with other inmates also being strip/vbc\nsearched, which search did not afford privacy from others; and (c) whose strip searches\n10 were conducted pursuant to KCSDโs blanket policy, practice and/or custom to regularly\nconduct strip/vbc searches in a group setting.\n11\nOn April 28, 2009, Defendants Sheriff Donny Youngblood and former Sheriff Mack\n12\nWimbish filed a notice of appeal as to the Courtโs determination that they were not entitled\n13\nEleventh Amendment immunity as to Plaintiffsโ section 1983 claims.  The appeal was processed\n14\nto the Ninth Circuit on May 13, 2009, and has been assigned USCA Case Number 09-16006.  \n15\nOn April 28, 2009, Defendants County of Kern, Kern County Sheriffโs Office, Donny\n16\nYoungblood and Mack Wimbish also filed the instant motion for entry of judgment pursuant to\n17\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b).  Defendants move the Court to certify the following\n18\nissues for immediate appeal: (1) whether the County of Kern may be held liable under 42 U.S.C.\n19\nยง 1983 for the policies of the Sheriff as they relate to operation of the jail; (2) whether strip\n20\nsearching inmates in groups violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution;\n21\n(3) whether strip searching inmates in groups violated Section 1 of the California\n22\nConstitution; and (4) whether strip searching inmates in groups forms an underlying basis for\n23\nliability under California Civil Code section 52.1.  Defendants applied for a stay as to the\n24\nremaining issues.  Defendants supported their motion with the declaration of counsel, Jennifer\n25\nThurston.  \n26\nPlaintiffs filed their opposition to the motion on May 15, 2009, along with the declaration\n27\nof counsel, Barrett Litt.  \n28\n3\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 114    Filed 07/01/09   Page 4 of 8\n1 Defendants filed a reply on May 22, 2009.  On that same date, Defendants filed a motion\n2 for certification of issues for immediate interlocutory review pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1292, for\n3 amendment of the Courtโs March 31, 2008, order and for a stay pending appeal.  Similar to the\n4 Rule 54(b) motion, the motion for interlocutory review includes, but is not limited to the issue of\n5 the constitutionality of group strip searches of post-arraignment detainees and inmates under the\n6 Fourth Amendment and the issue of the Countyโs status as a potentially improper party based on\n7 Eleventh Amendment immunity of the Sheriff defendants.  The interlocutory review motion was\n8 heard on the same day as the instant motion.\n9 DISCUSSION\n10 A. Legal Standard\n11 Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows for the entry of final judgment\n12 with respect to less than all parties or claims in an action if the court makes โan express\n13 determination that there is no just reason for delayโ and expressly directs โentry of judgment.โ \n14 Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b).1  In making a determination under Rule 54(b), the court must first\n15 determine that it is dealing with a final judgment, which means a decision that is โan ultimate\n16 disposition of an individual claim entered in the course of a multiple claims action.โ \n17 Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. General Elec. Co., 446 U.S. 1, 7 (1980); Sears, Roebuck & Co. v.\n18 Mackey, 351 U.S. 427, 436 (1956).  Second, the court must determine whether there is any just\n19 reason for delay.  Curtiss-Wright Corp., 446 U.S. at 7.  In sum, Rule 54(b) requires the presence\n20 of three conditions: (1) multiple claims or multiple parties; (2) at least one claim or the rights and\n21 liabilities of one party have been finally decided; and (3) there is no just reason for any delay in\n22 entering judgment and allowing an appeal. See 10 Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal Practice and\n23 Procedure: Civil 3d ยง 2656 (1998).\n24\n25\n26\n27 1Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b) states: โWhen an action presents more than one claim for reliefโwhether as a claim,\ncounterclaim, crossclaim, or third-party claimโor when multiple parties are involved, the court may direct entry of a\n28 final judgment as to one or more, but fewer than all, claims or parties only if the court expressly determines that there\nis no just reason for delay.โ\n4\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 114    Filed 07/01/09   Page 5 of 8\n1 B. Analysis\n2 1. Final Determination\n3 Defendant County requests entry of judgment on the following: (1) the Countyโs section\n4 1983 liability for the policies or customs of KCSO; and (2) the Courtโs determination that\n5 searching inmates in groups is unconstitutional, including liability under the Fourth Amendment,\n6 Article I, Section 1 of the California Constitution and California Civil Code section 52.1. \n7 Defendants contend that the Court has made final determinations on these โclaims.โ\n8 Plaintiffs counter that Defendantsโ basis for an appeal falls short because, despite a liability\n9 determination, there has been no damages determination.  As noted by Plaintiffs, the Ninth Circuit\n10 has held that โa judgment is not final as to one entire claim under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1291, or under\n11 F.R.Civ.P. 54(b) if it decides only liability and leaves open the question of relief.โ  Wolf v. Banco\n12 Nacional de Mexico, S.A., 721 F.2d 660, 662 (9th Cir. 1983) (an appeal did not lie under Rule\n13 54(b) where the judgment addressed liability on one claim but did not address any requested\n14 damages or attorneyโs fees); cf. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Wetzel, 424 U.S. 737, 744 (1976)\n15 (discussing ยง 1291 and indicating no finality where assessment of damages or awarding of other\n16 relief remains to be resolved); Hain Pure Food Co., Inc. v. Sona Food Products Co., 618 F.2d 521,\n17 522 (9th Cir. 1980) (discussing ยง 1292 and concluding that the determination of liability alone is\n18 not a final judgment); United States v. Southern Pac. Transp. Co., 543 F.2d 676, 681 n. 5 (9th Cir.\n19 1976) (district court decided only the issue of liability, without deciding what relief would be\n20 appropriate, and therefore the judgment was not final as to one entire claim and not appealable\n21 under ยง 1291).\n22 As to the issues identified by the Defendants for entry of judgment, the Court has ruled on\n23 the Countyโs section 1983 liability and the unconstitutional nature of the group strip searches,\n24 without deciding what relief and/or damages would be appropriate.  Defendants have not\n25 adequately addressed the absence of a damages ruling in their papers.2  At oral argument,\n26\n27 2Defendant County objected to the lateness of Plaintiffsโ opposition, noting it was due on May 12, 2009, but\nwas not filed and served electronically until May 15, 2009.  Based on the original hearing date of May 29, 2009,\n28 Plaintiffsโ opposition was late pursuant to the Local Rules.  Local Rule 78-230(c) requires either personal service 14\ndays before the hearing or electronic service 17 days before the hearing.  However, Defendants were able to file a\n5\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 114    Filed 07/01/09   Page 6 of 8\n1 Defendants acknowledged that entry of judgment would place these issues in an unusual posture on\n2 appeal where there has been no ruling on damages.  Absent a damage determination or resolution\n3 as to relief, the Court finds that judgment is not final as to one entire claim and therefore not\n4 appropriate for entry of judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b).  \n5 2. No Just Reason to Delay Appeal\n6 Defendants cite General Acquisition, Inc. v. GenCorp, Inc., 23 F.3d 1022, 1030 (6th Cir.\n7 1994), which lists factors to consider when making a Rule 54(b) determination regarding a just\n8 reason for delay.  In that case, the court noted that โ[n]o precise test exists for determining whether\n9 there is a just reason to delay,โ but articulated factors for consideration to include:\n10 (1) the relationship between the adjudicated and unadjudicated claims; (2) the\npossibility that the need for review might or might not be mooted by future\n11 developments in the district court; (3) the possibility that the reviewing court might\nbe obliged to consider the same issue a second time; (4) the presence or absence of a\n12 claim or counterclaim which could result in set-off against the judgment sought to\nbe made final; (5) miscellaneous factors such as delay, economic and solvency\n13 considerations, shortening the time of trial, frivolity of competing claims, expense\nand the like.\n14\nId. at 1030.  \n15\nApplying the General Acquisition factors, Defendants submit the declaration of counsel and\n16\naver that (1) there is no factual or legal relationship between the matters not decided by the Court\n17\nor the issue of strip searching court โreleaseesโ and those issues sought to be appealed; (2) no\n18\ndevelopment in the trial court (outside of sua sponte reversal by the Court) will moot the need for\n19\nappellate review of the identified issues; (3) decisions on the appealed issues could streamline the\n20\ntrial on the remaining issues, e.g., an appellate determination that the Sheriff acted for the state, not\n21\nthe County, would preclude further litigation or a determination that group strip searches were\n22\nlawful would cut the lawsuit in half and reduce prospective class members to a โmere fractionโ; (4)\n23\nthe trial could be greatly shortened if the County is successful because of the reduced number of\n24\nplaintiffs and issues; (5) the Courtโs time and the partiesโ time would be reduced and economic\n25\nresources preserved, including the need for notifying prospective class members; (6) the matter is\n26\n27\nreply to the opposition on May 22, 2009, and have not demonstrated any prejudice resulting from the late-filed\n28 opposition.  On May 26, 2009, the Court rescheduled the original hearing date to coincide with the hearing on\nDefendantsโ motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1292(b).  \n6\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 114    Filed 07/01/09   Page 7 of 8\n1 being appealed by Youngblood and Wimbish as of right so there is little justification for failing to\n2 obtain appellate review as to all ripe issues; and (7) the issues are distinct from those not appealed\n3 and the Court of Appeals would not decide the same issue more than once.  Thurston Decl., ยถยถ 4,\n4 7-8, 10-11.\n5 In their briefing, Defendants miscite General Acquisition as a Ninth Circuit case, and\n6 contend that the Court should apply these five factors.  General Acquisition is a case from the\n7 Sixth Circuit and is not binding.  At a minimum, however, the Court โmust take into account\n8 judicial administrative interests as well as the equities involved,โ including such factors โas\n9 whether the claims under review [are] separable from the others remaining to be adjudicated and\n10 whether the nature of the claims already determined [is] such that no appellate court would have to\n11 decide the same issues more than once even if there were subsequent appeals.โ  Curtiss-Wright\n12 Corp., 446 U.S. at 8 (noting that one factor may be offset by another).  \n13 Plaintiffs counter that if Defendants appeal the post-release liability determination in the\n14 future, granting a Rule 54(b) judgment โwould result in piecemeal appeals involving the same\n15 basic set of facts.โ  Opposition, p. 7.  Plaintiffs contend that the asserted justifications for strip\n16 searching persons post-release, which is not the subject of the instant motion, are the same as those\n17 asserted for group strip searches and, thus, the Court of Appeals would have to review the same\n18 evidence more than once.  A similarity of legal or factual issues weigh heavily against entry of\n19 judgment under Rule 54(b) and such an order โwill be proper only where necessary to avoid a\n20 harsh and unjust result.โ  Morrison-Knudsen Co., Inc. v. Archer, 655 F.2d 962, 965 (9th Cir.\n21 1981).  Although Defendants argue that there is no factual similarity between the group search\n22 class and the post-release strip search class, the Court notes that there is an overlap in asserted\n23 justifications for the group searches and the post-release searches, which weighs against entry of\n24 judgment. \n25 CONCLUSION\n26 Based on the above, Defendantsโ motion for entry of judgment on specified claims and\n27 certification of claims for appeal pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b) is DENIED.  As the Court has\n28\n7\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB   Document 114    Filed 07/01/09   Page 8 of 8\n1 declined to enter judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 54 (b), the corresponding application for\n2 stay also is DENIED.\n3\n4 IT IS SO ORDERED.                                                                                                     \n5 Dated:      June 30, 2009                                  /s/ Dennis L.

The matter was heard on December 19, 2008, before the Honorable Dennis\n19 L. Beck, United States Magistrate Judge.  Barrett Litt and Donald Cook appeared on behalf of\n20 Plaintiffs.  Jennifer Thurston and Terence Cassidy appeared on behalf of Defendants Kern\n21 County, the Kern County Sheriffโs Office, Sheriff Donny Youngblood (individually and in his\n22 official capacity) and Former Sheriff Mack Wimbish (individually) (โDefendantsโ).\n23 BACKGROUND\n24 Plaintiff Marsial Lopez, individually and as class representative, filed the instant civil\n25 rights action on March 27, 2007.  On June 21, 2007, Plaintiffs Marsial Lopez, Sandra Chavez,\n26 and Theodore Medina, individually and as class representatives, filed a First Amended\n27 Complaint (โFACโ) against Kern County, the Kern County Sheriffโs Department, Kern County\n28 Sheriff Donny Youngblood (officially and individually) and former Kern County Sheriff Mack\n1\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 90      Filed 03/31/2009     Page 2 of 5\n1 Wimbish (individually).  Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief and damages resulting from the strip\n2 and/or visual body cavity searches of prisoners by the Kern County Sheriffโs Department. \n3 The FAC contains six causes of action:  (1) damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983\n4 premised on unreasonable searches and seizures in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth\n5 Amendments of the U.S. Constitution; (2) damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 premised on\n6 violation Fourteenth Amendment equal protection guarantees; (3) violation of their equal\n7 protection rights pursuant to Article I, ยง 7 of the California Constitution and unreasonable search\n8 and seizure in violation of Article I, ยง 13 of the California Constitution; (4) damages pursuant to\n9 California Civil Code ยง 52.1(b) and ยง 52(b) premised on violations of their rights under the\n10 Fourth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Article I, ยงยง 1, 7, 13 and 17 of the California\n11 Constitution, and California Penal Code ยง 4030; (5) violation of California Penal Code ยง 4030;\n12 and (6) violation of mandatory duties under California Government Code ยง 815.6. \n13 On November 12, 2008, Plaintiffs filed the instant motion for leave to file a second\n14 amended complaint.1  Plaintiffs seek to add a seventh cause of action under Article I, ยง1 of the\n15 California Constitution for violations of their privacy rights.  Plaintiffs argue that the proposed\n16 cause of action was โmistakenly omittedโ from the original complaint.  \n17 Defendants filed a joint opposition on December 2, 2008.  Plaintiffs filed a reply on\n18 December 5, 2008.\n19 DISCUSSION\n20 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 15(a) provides that the court โshould freely give\n21 leave when justice so requires.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2).  The United States Supreme Court has\n22 stated: \n23 [i]n the absence of any apparent or declared reason โ such as undue delay, bad faith or\ndilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by\n24 amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of\nallowance of the amendment, futility of amendment, etc. โ the leave sought should, as the\n25 rules require, be โfreely given.โ\n26\n27\n28 1Plaintiffsโ motion for partial summary judgment, Defendantsโ two joint motions for summary adjudication,\nPlaintiffsโ motion to certify the class and Plaintiffsโ motion to strike also are pending before the Court. \n2\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 90      Filed 03/31/2009     Page 3 of 5\n1 Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962).  The Ninth Circuit has summarized these factors to\n2 include the following: (1) undue delay; (2) bad faith; (3) prejudice to the opponent; and (4)\n3 futility of amendment.  Loehr v. Ventura County Cmty. Coll. Dist., 743 F.2d 1310, 1319 (9th Cir.\n4 1984).  Leave to amend rests in the sound discretion of the trial court.  Swanson v. United States\n5 Forest Serv., 87 F.3d 339, 343 (9th Cir. 1996).  Despite the policy favoring amendment under\n6 Rule 15, leave to amend may be denied if the proposed amendment is futile or would be subject\n7 to dismissal.  Saul v. United States, 928 F.2d 829, 843 (9th Cir. 1991).\n8 Defendants object to the proposed amendment on two grounds: (1) prejudice and (2)\n9 futility.  To demonstrate prejudice, Defendants point out that the instant motion follows the filing\n10 of dispositive motions.  Defendants contend that Plaintiffs attempted to assert this new claim in\n11 their Opposition to Defendants first motion for summary adjudication regarding strip searches. \n12 Defendants noted this impropriety in their reply of October 3, 2008.  Defendants then filed a\n13 second summary adjudication motion on November 7, 2008, regarding qualified immunity,\n14 Eleventh Amendment immunity and court returnees.  Defendants argue that Plaintiffs did not\n15 seek to amend their complaint until November 12, 2008, โsome six weeks after Defendants first\n16 called attention to their omission and after two dispositive motions were filed.โ  (Defs.โ Joint\n17 Opp. to Plaintiffsโ Mot. to Amend Complaint 2).  \n18 Defendants argue that the delay and related expense constitute prejudice, citing Ansam\n19 Assocs., Inc. v. Cola Petroleum, Ltd., 760 F.2d 442, 446 (2d Cir. 1985) and Campbell v. Emory\n20 Clinic, 166 F.3d 1157, 1162 (11th Cir. 1999).  Defendants citations are not instructive.  In\n21 Ansam, the court upheld the denial of leave to amend due to prejudice associated with the close\n22 of discovery and the filing of a motion for summary judgment.  However, the proposed claims in\n23 Ansam involved an entirely new set of operative facts, a different period of time and a different\n24 statute from the operative pleading.  Id. at 446.  Here, Plaintiffs propose to add a claim regarding\n25 the right to privacy under the California Constitution.  This claim does not involve a new set of\n26 facts, a different time period or even a different statute from the operative pleading.  For instance,\n27 Plaintiffs partially base their fourth cause of action under Civil Code ยง 52.1(b) on an underlying\n28 violation of Article I, ยง 1 of the California Constitution.  FAC, at ยถ 50.  \n3\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 90      Filed 03/31/2009     Page 4 of 5\n1 The instant case also differs from Campbell.  In that case, the court found prejudice and\n2 undue delay inherent in an amendment asserted after the close of discovery and after dispositive\n3 motions were filed, briefed, and decided.  Campbell, 166 F.3d at 1162.  The motions for leave to\n4 amend in Campbell were filed more than one year after discovery had ended, after dispositive\n5 motions had been filed, between five-and-six years after the lawsuits had begun and after the\n6 plaintiff had been twice granted leave to amend.  In this case, the dispositive motions have not\n7 been decided, this case has been pending for two years and Plaintiffs have not requested leave to\n8 amend at any other time.\n9 Defendants further contend that the original complaint did not โreasonablyโ place them\n10 on notice that Plaintiffs intended to assert an independent ยง 1 claim.  Although Defendants\n11 objected to the assertion of the section 1 claim in Plaintiffsโ cross-motion for summary judgment,\n12 Defendants responded to it in their opposition to Plaintiffsโ cross-motion.  (Doc. 75).  Defendants\n13 argued, in part, that just as Plaintiffsโ Fourth Amendment claim must fail, their Section 1 claim\n14 must fail because the right of privacy established by Section 1 is not a broader protection than\n15 that provided under the Fourth Amendment.  (Defs.โ Opp. Cross-Mot. Sum. Adjud. 18.) \n16 Several courts have indicated that in the search and seizure context, the Article I, ยง 1\n17 privacy clause of the California Constitution has not been held to establish a broader protection\n18 than that provided by the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  See, e.g., Quon\n19 v. Arch Wireless Operating Co., Inc., 529 F.3d 892, 903 (9th Cir. 2008) (the privacy protected by\n20 Article I, Section 1 of the California Constitution is no broader in the area of search and seizure\n21 than the privacy protected by the Fourth Amendment) (quoting Hill v. Natโl Collegiate Ath.\n22 Assโn, 7 Cal.4th 1, 30 n.9 (1994)), rehโg denied, 554 F.3d 769 (2009); Sanchez v. County of San\n23 Diego, 464 F.3d 916, 943 (9th Cir. 2006) (in search and seizure context, the Article I, Section 1,\n24 privacy clause of the California Constitution has never been held to establish a broader protection\n25 than that provided by the Fourth Amendment).  Accordingly, the Court finds no prejudice to the\n26 proposed amendment as Defendants fully briefed their contentions under the Fourth Amendment.\n27\n28\n4\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 90      Filed 03/31/2009     Page 5 of 5\n1 Insofar as Defendants argue that the proposed amendment is futile because of the\n2 reasonable nature of the searches at issue, the Court defers such determination until resolution of\n3 the pending summary judgment motions.\n4 Based on the above, Plaintiffsโ motion for leave to file a second amended complaint is\n5 GRANTED.\n6\n7 IT IS SO ORDERED.                                                                                                     \n8 Dated:      March 31, 2009                                  /s/ Dennis L.

On June 21, 2007, Plaintiffs Marsial Lopez, Sandra Chavez\n28 and Theodore Medina, individually and as class representatives, filed a First Amended\n1\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 92      Filed 04/01/2009     Page 2 of 9\n1 Complaint (โFACโ) against Kern County, the Kern County Sheriffโs Office, Sheriff Donny\n2 Youngblood (individually and in his official capacity) and Former Sheriff Mack Wimbish\n3 (individually).  The action concerns the manner in which prisoners are searched in Kern Countyโs\n4 jails and alleges violations of the Fourth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, as well as\n5 violations of the California Constitution.\n6 On June 17, 2008, Plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification, seeking certification of\n7 two classes- the Post-Release Class and the Group Strip Search Class.  Defendants opposed the\n8 motion on July 17, 2008.  Plaintiffs filed their reply on July 28, 2008, along with a motion to\n9 strike the declaration of Ian Silva in support of Defendantsโ opposition.  Defendantsโ opposed the\n10 motion to strike on October 3, 2008. \n11 FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n12 The FAC sets forth the claims of the class representatives as follows:\n13 1. Plaintiff Marsial Lopez: After surrendering himself to out-of-state officers, Lopez\nwas incarcerated in Kern County Jails from June 2005 through November 2006. \n14 When he was transferred between jail facilities and when he was returned to jail\nfrom court, he was subjected to intrusive strip/visual body cavity (โvbcโ) searches,\n15 in the presence of others not necessary for the searches, without privacy and in\nunsanitary conditions.  On November 6, 2006, he was taken to court and all\n16 charges against him were dismissed based on DNA evidence.  He was ordered\nreleased, though when he returned to jail for the sole purpose of processing his\n17 release, he was subject to an illegal an intrusive strip/vbc search, in unsanitary\nconditions, without privacy and without reasonable suspicion that he possessed\n18 contraband or weapons.  \n19 2. Plaintiff Sandra Chavez: On February 17, 2007, Chavez was arrested and upon\nher arrival at the jail, Kern County Sheriffโs Department (โKCSDโ) personnel\n20 subjected her to an intrusive strip/vbc search.  She was searched in a room with\nfour or five other women and male officer within view.  At the time of the search,\n21 KCSD had no probable cause or reasonable suspicion that Chavez or the other\nprisoners were in possession of contraband.  She was eventually released from\n22 custody and given a fine and probation.\n23 3. Plaintiff Theodore Medina: On June 7, 2006, Medina was arrested by KCSD\npersonnel and transported to jail.  Upon arrival, he was subjected to an intrusive\n24 strip and vbc search in a room with four or five other arrestees.  At the time of the\nsearch, KCSD had no probable cause or reasonable suspicion that Medina or the\n25 other arrestees were in possession of contraband.\n26 Within two years from the filing of the FAC, Medina was also arrested on\na charge of spousal abuse.  While being booked, KCSD personnel subjected him\n27 to an intrusive strip and visual body cavity search (โvbcโ), in the presence of\nothers not involved in the search and in unsanitary conditions.  He was eventually\n28 ordered released, and as a routine part of out-processing, he was subjected to an\n2\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 92      Filed 04/01/2009     Page 3 of 9\n1 intrusive strip search, in the presence of others not involved and in unsanitary\nconditions, in the absence of probable cause.\n2\nPlaintiffs allege that the searches were conducted pursuant to Defendantsโ policy and\n3\npractice to indiscriminately search all, or a large number of, persons being processed into jail\n4\nwithout regard to the nature of their offense, whether they are under an order of release, whether\n5\nthere was probable cause, etc.  They further allege that Defendants have a policy of not limiting\n6\nthe persons who can see, hear or observe the searches, meaning that other inmates, members of\n7\nthe opposite sex, disposable jail personnel and others are able to see the searches and the class\n8\nmembersโ naked bodies. \n9\nBased on these allegations, Plaintiffs allege (1) violation of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 (Fourth\n10\nAmendment protection against unreasonable search and seizures); (2) violation of Equal\n11\nProtection; (3) violation of California Constitution, Article I, sections 7 and 13; (4) violation of\n12\nCalifornia Civil Code section 52.1(b) (civil action for protection of rights); (5) violation of\n13\nstatutory duties, Penal Code section 4030 (policies and practices for strip and body cavity\n14\nsearches)1; and (6) violation of mandatory duties to protect against specific injuries under\n15\nCalifornia Government Code section 815.6.\n16\nPlaintiffs seek injunctive relief, as well as general, special, statutory and punitive\n17\ndamages.  \n18\nDISCUSSION\n19\nI. MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION\n20\nPlaintiffs seek to certify the following classes:\n21\nPost-Release Class (Medina and Lopez): persons who, from March 27, 2005, up to\n22 October 1, 2007,2 or the time of judgment or settlement of the case: (a) were in KCSD\ncustody; (b) were taken from jail to court; (c) became entitled to release after going to\n23 court; and (d) were strip and/or vbc searched before release pursuant to KCSDโs blanket\npolicy, practice and/or custom to strip/vbc search all court returns, including those\n24 entitled to release. \n25\n26\n1 Although section 4030 specifically states that it is applicable only to โprearraignment detainees arrested\nfor infraction or misdemeanor offenses,โ Plaintiffs believe that the section applies to felony arrestees, as well. \n27\nDefendants dispute this point.\n28\n2 Plaintiffs contend that the policies at issue were in effect until October 2007.\n3\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 92      Filed 04/01/2009     Page 4 of 9\n1 Group Strip Search Class (Lopez, Chavez and Sanchez):  persons who, from March 27,\n2005, up to October 1, 2007, or the time of judgment or settlement of the case: (a) were in\n2 KCSD custody; (b) were subjected to a strip and/or vbc search in a group with other\ninmates also being strip/vbc searched, which search did not afford privacy from others;\n3 and (c) whose strip searches were conducted pursuant to KCSDโs blanket policy, practice\nand/or custom to regularly conduct strip/vbc searches in a group setting.  \n4\nTo qualify for class certification, Plaintiffs must satisfy all of the requirements of Rule\n5\n23(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure and any one of the requirements of Rule 23(b).  Rule 23(a)\n6\nrequires (1) impracticability of joinder due to numerosity; (2) commonality of questions of law or\n7\nfact; (3) typicality of claims; and (4) adequacy of representation. \n8\nThe burden is on the party seeking to maintain the class action.  In this case, Plaintiff\n9\nmust establish a prima facie showing of each of the elements of Rule 23(a) prerequisites and the\n10\nappropriate 23(b) ground for a class action.  Taylor v. Safeway Stores, Inc., 524 F.2d 263, 270\n11\n(10th Cir. 1975), overruled on other grounds by Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club, 463 U.S. 680\n12\n(1983).  The burden, however, is slight.  Plaintiff need only present sufficient proof to allow the\n13\ncourt to come to a โreasonable judgmentโ on each requirement.  Blackie v. Barrack, 524 F.2d\n14\n891, 901 (9th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 816 (1976).  \n15\nA. 23(a) Requirements\n16\n1. Numerosity\n17\nThe class must be so numerous that joinder of all members individually is\n18\nโimpracticable.โ  Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(1).  No specific numerical threshold is required; each case\n19\nmust be examined.  General Tel.C. v. E.E.O.C., 446 U.S. 318, 330, 100 S.Ct. 1698 (1980). \n20\nGenerally, 40 or more members will satisfy the numerosity requirement.  Consolidated Rail\n21\nCorp. v. Town of Hyde Park, 47 F.3d 473, 483 (2nd Cir. 1995).\n22\nTo establish numerosity, Plaintiffs point to the sheer number of individuals who are\n23\nprocessed, transported and returned under the authority of the KCSD.  For example, there is an\n24\naverage daily population of 2,500 inmates, and 40,000 new arrests are received a year.  Assuming\n25\nthat the practice ceased as of October 2007, and given the class period of 30 months, Plaintiffs\n26\ncalculate that approximately 100,000 individuals were processed.  Sgt. Gonzales, the\n27\nclassification supervisor, calculated that in 2006 alone, 51,882 inmates were transported to and\n28\n4\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 92      Filed 04/01/2009     Page 5 of 9\n1 from court and 44,797 inmates were released by the jails.  Declaration of Barrett S. Litt (โLitt\n2 Dec.โ), Ex. 9.  Plaintiffs have not yet identified a precise number because they have not received\n3 Sgt. Gonzalesโ computer database.  \n4 Defendants do not dispute numerosity.  In any event, the numbers provided by Plaintiffs\n5 satisfy the numerosity requirement.\n6 2. Commonality\n7 There must be questions of law or fact common to the class.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(2).  A\n8 โcommon nucleus of operative factsโ is usually enough to satisfy the commonality requirement. \n9 Rosario v. Livaditis, 963 F.2d 1013, 1017-18 (7th Cir. 1992).\n10 Plaintiffs contend, and the Court agrees, that class certification in this action would not\n11 turn on the individual circumstances of each search.  Rather, common issues exist where there is\n12 a blanket policy of (1) conducting strip/vbc searches of those returning from court and entitled to\n13 release; and (2) conducting strip/vbc searches in groups where inmates could view each other. \n14 These blanket policies obviate the need to conduct individualized liability determinations.\n15 Defendants take issue with the class definitions, arguing that individuals who were not\n16 searched would be allowed into the class.  However, each definition clearly states that the class\n17 includes, among other things, individuals who โwere strip and/or vbc searched before releaseโ\n18 and those who โwere subjected to a strip and/or vbc search in a group with other inmates also\n19 being strip/vbc searched, which search did not afford privacy from others.โ  A basic requirement\n20 of each class is the necessity of the individual to have been actually searched.  The Court\n21 therefore finds no problem with the definitions.\n22 3. Typicality\n23 Rule 23(a)(3) requires that โthe claims or defenses of the representative parties [be]\n24  typical of the claims or defenses of the class.โ  In General Tele. Co. of the Southwest v. Falcon,\n25 457 U.S. 147, 102 S.Ct. 2364 (1982), the Court noted โ[t]he commonality  and typicality\n26 requirements of Rule 23(a) tend to merge.โ  457 U.S. at 157 n. 13, 102 S.Ct. 2364.  A named\n27 plaintiffsโ claim is โtypicalโ under Rule 23 if it arises โfrom the same event or practice or course\n28 of conduct that gives rise to the claims of the other class members and his or her claims are based\n5\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 92      Filed 04/01/2009     Page 6 of 9\n1 on the same legal theory.โ  Ballard v. Equifax Check Services, 186 F.R.D. 589, 595 (E.D.Cal.\n2 1999). \n3 The typicality requirement is satisfied for the same reasons Plaintiffs have demonstrated\n4 commonality.  The Plaintiffsโ allegations arise from the same practice or course of conduct of\n5 Defendants, and certainly, their claims are based on the same legal theory.\n6 4. Adequacy of Representation\n7 The person representing the class must be able โfairly and adequately to protect the\n8 interestsโ of all members in the class.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(4).  The representation is โadequateโ if\n9 the attorney representing the class is qualified and competent and the class representatives are not\n10 disqualified by interests antagonistic to the remainder of the class.  Lerwill v. Inflight Motion\n11 Pictures, Inc., 582 F.2d 597, 512 (9th Cir. 1978).\n12 Although Defendants suggest that Plaintiffs do not fall into the categories they propose to\n13 represent, the interests of the class members are aligned because they were all subject to the same\n14 blanket policy.  \n15 As to Class Counsel, there does not appear to be any dispute as to the qualifications of\n16 either Mr. Litt or Mr. Ester.\n17 B. 23(b) Requirements\n18 Although Plaintiffs seek certification under all three sections of Rule 23(b), they do not\n19 address 23(b)(2).  As discussed below, the Court finds the class suitable for certification under\n20 23(b)(3) and will therefore not analyze 23(b)(1).\n21 Rule 23(b)(3) provides for certification when:\n22 (3) the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class \npredominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action\n23 is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the\ncontroversy. The matters pertinent to the findings include: (A) the interest of members of\n24 the class in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions; (B) the\nextent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already commenced by or\n25 against members of the class; (C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the\nlitigation of the claims in the particular forum; (D) the difficulties likely to be\n26 encountered in the management of a class action.\n27 The satisfaction of the typicality requirement of Rule 23(a) goes a long way towards\n28\n6\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 92      Filed 04/01/2009     Page 7 of 9\n1 satisfying the Rule 23(b)(3) requirement of commonality.  Gen. Tel. Co. of the Southwest v.\n2 Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 157 n. 13 (1982). \n3 It appears that only commonality/predominance and management are at issue.  As to\n4 commonality, the Court again finds because this action involves a challenge to Defendantsโ\n5 blanket strip/vbc search policy, the question of law and fact common to the class members\n6 predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.  Plaintiffs identify two key\n7 questions common to all members: (1) whether the County has a particular strip search policy;\n8 and (2) whether the policy violates the constitution.  In other words, proof of liability will not\n9 vary among members of the class.\n10 Insofar as Defendants rely on the โvastly differentโ experience of each Plaintiff to defeat\n11 predominance, they unpersuasively attempt to turn the Courtโs attention away from the actual\n12 issue- the constitutionality of the blanket strip/vbc search policy.  In fact, a majority of\n13 Defendantsโ opposition and supporting declarations focus mainly on factual issues in an attempt\n14 to justify their policy.  Such inquiries are not relevant at the class certification stage.  In any\n15 event, the individualized experiences Defendants point to, such as whether Plaintiffs were\n16 consistently subject to searches and the circumstances under which each Plaintiff was transported\n17 to and from court, have little relevance to the constitutionality of the blanket policy.  \n18 Defendantsโ reliance on Klein v. DuPage County, 119 F.R.D. 29, 31 (N.D.Ill. 1988), is\n19 also misplaced.  Klein involved a group of inmates who alleged that routine strip and cavity\n20 searches before and after court appearances and visitation violated the Fourth Amendment. \n21 There, the court denied class certification, explaining:\n22 Here, where there are special institutional security concerns and where each plaintiff may\nhave been arrested for different reasons, may have had full or no contact with those\n23 outside the prison, may pose little or great threats to prison safety, and may have been\nsearched in a variety of ways at numerous different times, it is questionable that there is a\n24 narrow issue suitable for one constitutional determination in the context of a class action.\n25 The court also explained that whether the searches were reasonable or unconstitutional โis\n26 a fact-specific inquiry that depends upon the way each plaintiff was searched and the security\n27 risks presented by each plaintiff.โ  Klein, 119 F.R.D at 30.  Here, however, such issues are not\n28 relevant.  There is no dispute that the Kern County Jail has โspecial institutional security\n7\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 92      Filed 04/01/2009     Page 8 of 9\n1 concerns,โ nor is there any issue as to why each Plaintiff was arrested.  Moreover, while the\n2 prisoners in Klein may have been searched โin a variety of ways at numerous different times,โ\n3 the variability of Plaintiffsโ searches is not relevant to the central issue- whether the blanket\n4 policy, to which all Plaintiffs were subject, was constitutional.  In fact, Klein noted that\n5 certification may be proper in cases involving the โnarrow questionโ of whether a โblanket\n6 policyโ was constitutional.  Klein, 119 F.RD. at 30.  Put simply, Klein denied class certification\n7 for reasons that are either not disputed here, or are not relevant to the ultimate issue.3  See also\n8 Blihovde v. St. Croix County, 219 F.R.D 607, 621 (W.D. Wis. 2003) (distinguishing Klein\n9 because plaintiffs did not allege that they were searched in accordance with a uniform policy).  \n10 While the Court finds that commonality exists, it recognizes Defendantsโ concern over\n11 individualized damages.  Individual damage issues do not defeat a finding that common\n12 questions of law or fact predominate, though it may warrant a method for handling damages. \n13 Based on Plaintiffsโ representations in their briefing and discussions at oral argument, the Court\n14 is satisfied that any individualized damage issues can be properly managed.  The Court can re-\n15 visit this issue if and when it becomes necessary.\n16 Accordingly, based on the above analysis, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffsโ motion for class\n17 certification and CERTIFIES the following classes under Rule 23(b)(3):\n18 Post-Release Class: Persons who, from March 27, 2005, up to October 1, 2007,4 or the\ntime of judgment or settlement of the case: (a) were in KCSD custody; (b) were taken\n19 from jail to court; (c) became entitled to release after going to court; and (d) were strip\nand/or vbc searched before release pursuant to KCSDโs blanket policy, practice and/or\n20 custom to strip/vbc search all court returns, including those entitled to release. \n21 Group Strip Search Class: Persons who, from March 27, 2005, up to October 1, 2007, or\nthe time of judgment or settlement of the case: (a) were in KCSD custody; (b) were\n22 subjected to a strip and/or vbc search in a group with other inmates also being strip/vbc\nsearched, which search did not afford privacy from others; and (c) whose strip searches\n23 were conducted pursuant to KCSDโs blanket policy, practice and/or custom to regularly\nconduct strip/vbc searches in a group setting.  \n24\n25\n26\n27 3 The Court also notes that later courts refused to follow the reasoning of Klein.  See eg. Gary v. Sheahan,\n1999 WL 281347, *3 (N.D. Ill. 1999).\n28\n4 Plaintiffs contend that the policies at issue were in effect until October 2007.\n8\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00474-DLB     Document 92      Filed 04/01/2009     Page 9 of 9\n1 II. MOTION TO STRIKE\n2 In conjunction with their reply, Plaintiffs moved to strike all but four paragraphs of Ian\n3 Silvaโs Declaration, filed in support of Defendantsโ opposition.  As Mr. Silvaโs Declaration did\n4 not factor into this Courtโs analysis, Plaintiffโs motion is DENIED AS MOOT.\n5 III.
