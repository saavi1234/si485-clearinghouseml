Plaintiffs seek an award of$258,000 in costs, most of which are for medial liens yet to be paid.

    "summary": "<p>On May 1, 2007, the Multi-Ethnic Immigrant Workers Organizing Network (MIWON), along with several other organizations, held a march and rally in MacArthur Part in Los Angeles, CA. MIWON had obtained a permit for the demonstration and met with the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) beforehand to work out the details of the rally. However, approximately four hours into the demonstration, without any dispersal order, the LAPD officers, dressing in riot gear, advanced on the peaceful protestors, hitting protestors with batons and shooting foam batons and other &ldquo;less lethal&rdquo; munitions at people indiscriminately. Only after several minutes of this treatment did the LAPD issue a dispersal order, which was in English only and was not even audible most people in attendance. There was no probable cause or reasonable suspicion to justify such use of force by the LAPD.</p>\r\n<p>On May 9, 2007, organizations and individuals present at the rally filed suit against the City of Los Angeles and the LAPD in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, included MIWON, the Korean Immigrant Workers Alliance, the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights Los Angeles, IDESPCA, Pilipino Workers Center, Garment Workers Center, and numerous individuals. The plaintiffs alleged that the LAPD used excessive force in trying to disperse the rally, therefore violating the U.S. Constitution's 1st, 4th, and 14th amendments, the California Constitution, and California Civil Code &sect; 52.1. The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief to prevent the LAPD from unlawfully dispersing permitted assemblies as well as damages.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs moved for class certification on September 6, 2007, and in his chamber minutes from December 14, 2007, Judge Howard Matz laid out his reasons for granting class certification. 246 F.R.D. 621. On January 8, 2008, the court certified a class for both structural relief and monetary relief for the reasons elaborated in the Court&rsquo;s chamber minutes. The certification for structural relief included anyone who engaged or may engage in peaceful demonstrations in LA, and who at the time of the demonstration were or are: (1) one of the plaintiff organizations; (2) officers and representatives of the plaintiffs' organizations, including people who participate in the Plaintiffs' organizations' events; (3) other organizations who advocate and/or organize on behalf of individuals' right to free speech and assembly; and (4) people who participate in events put on by the organizations described in (3). The certification for monetary relief included any persons present at the May 1, 2007 rally between 5-7pm who did not engage in conduct justifying the LAPD's use of force, and who were subject to the force or other unlawful police activity.</p>\r\n<p>The parties worked with Magistrate Judge Carla Woehile to negotiate a settlement agreement. On March 19, 2009, the court granted preliminary approval of a settlement agreement. The settlement created a class fund of $250,000 for unrepresented class members, and a represented individuals fund of $12,550,000 for the individual plaintiffs named in the suit. The agreement also stipulated an award of the class attorneys&rsquo; fees of $3,753,000. 2009 WL 9100391. Judge Matz granted final approval of the settlement agreement on June 23, 2009 and dismissed the suit with prejudice. 2009 WL 9112416.</p>\r\n<p>The structural relief order, issued by Judge Matz on June 24, 2009, restricted the LAPD from interfering with individuals' right to free speech for any reasons other than protecting public safety or public health, and required LAPD officers to issue a Declaration of Unlawful Assembly before taking any action. The relief order also placed restrictions on the methods of disbursement the LAPD may use, including limiting the use of &ldquo;less lethal&rdquo; weapons, batons, motorcycles and low-flying helicopters that would interfere with the demonstrators' right to free speech. Aside from these restrictions on use of force, the order stipulated that LAPD officers undergo annual training on proper crowd control policies and techniques.</p>\r\n<p>The district court retained jurisdiction over the case to enforce the agreed-upon relief for four years following the June 24, 2009 structural relief order. As those four years have passed, this case is now closed.&nbsp;</p>",

    "summary_short": "This class action was brought by protesters at a 2007 immigration rally in Los Angeles who were victims of excessive force by police officers trying to disperse the rally. The 2009 settlement awarded the plaintiffs damages of over $12 million and attorneys' fees of $3.7 million, as well as both structural reform of the LAPD. The structural reform placed limitations on the LAPD's ability to interfere with nonviolent demonstrations, including issuing a declaration of unlawful assembly before any using force to break up the demonstration. The order also restricted the methods of disbursement the LAPD can use, including limitations on the use of less lethal weapons, batons, motorcycles and low-flying helicopters that would interfere with the demonstration.

Plaintiffs bring this action for declaratory relief,\ninjunctive relief and\n3 damages under 42 U.S.C. §\n1983; the First, Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to\n4 the United States Constitution; Article I, §\n3, 7 and 13 of the California\n2,\n5 Constitution; and California Civil Code §\n52.1. Jurisdiction lies under 28 U.S.C. §\n6 1331, 1343, and 1367.\n7 2. Venue is proper in the Central District of California\nunder 28 U.S.C. §\n8 1391(b). Defendants reside in the Central District, and the acts or omissions\n9 complained of herein have occurred in the Central District.\n10\n11 FACTS\n12 3. This action seeks declaratory and injunctive relief\nrestraining the Los\n13 Angeles Police Department (\"LAPD\") from disrupting the exercise of First\n14 A.mendnient rights in public assemblies and marches\nthrough the unlawful dispersal\n15 of permitted assemblies, unreasonably using and\nunreasonably threatening to use\n16 \"less-lethal\" munitions to disperse peaceful demonstrators,\nunreasonably using and\n17 unreasonably threatening to use baton strikes against\npeacefl.il and dispersing\n18 demonstrators, unreasonably using and unreasonablythreatening to use motorcycles\n19 against peaceful demonstrators as a means of crowd control,\nunreasonably using and\n20 unreasonably threatening to use other forms of physical force\nagainst peaceful and\n21 dispersing demonstrators, all without any warning, a deficient and improper\n22 declaration of an unlawful assembly and insufficient time to\ncomply with the patently\n23 unlawful order to disperse. So, even if there were\nsome arguable justification for\n24 declaring an unlawful assembly in this instance —and there was not — the police\n25 action on May Day in MacArthur Park violated the law in\nevery possible respect.\n26 4. This action also asks for damages to compensate plaintiffs and the class\nthey\n27\n28\n\nseek to represent for violations of their First, Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment\n1\n2 rights (and corollary state rights), caused by policies, practices and customs of the\n3 Los Angeles Police Department (\"LAPD\") and the City of Los Angeles. Plaintiffs\n4 and the class they seek to represent were peaceful protestors, members of the media,\n5 delegates, legal observer, persons lawfully enjoying the use of MacArthur Park and\n6 other persons (hereafter collectively \"peaceful participants\") who were injured after\n7 the LAPD purportedly declared an assembly they were attending or nearby to\n8 unlawful, shot plaintiffs with \"less-lethal\" projectiles, hit them with batons and\n9 otherwise used force against them and injured them while they attempted to disperse.\n10 5. The events giving rise to this action occurred at approximately 6:15 p.m.\n11 during a permitted immigrants' rights march and rally on May 1 in MacArthur Park,\n12 located at Wilshire Boulevard and Alvarado Boulevard.\n13 6. On May 1, 2007, the Multi-ethnic Immigrant Worker Organizing Network\n14 (\"MIWON\") conducted a march and rally, beginning at approximately 2 p.m. at\n15 Vermont Avenue and Third Street, traveling through multi-ethnic communities along\n16 Olympic Boulevard, then north on Alvarado Boulevard to a scheduled rally in\n17 MacArthur Park. The event was permitted to continue until 9:00 p.m. The marchers\n18 began on the sidewalks, as required by their permit, but by the time the group reached\n19 Olympic and Vermont, the number of marchers was so great that the police then\n20 closed two lanes of traffic to facilitate the march. The main rally was held at the\n21 soccer field in MacArthur Park, located in the northwest quadrant of the Park.\n22 Approximately 5,000 people participated in the march. Prior to the event, MIWON\n23 obtained a permit from the City of Los Angeles and met several times with\n24 representatives of the LAPD to work out the details of the planned demonstration.\n25 7. At approximately 6:17 p.m., on May 1, 2007, an announcement was made\n26 from a helicopter that the permitted rally had been declared an unlawful assembly and\n27\n-2-\n28\n\nI those present were ordered to disperse. The\nannouncement was inaudible to most of\n2 those in the park, including the LAPD officers\npresent. Radio traffic between LAPD\n3 officers indicated that\nmany of them could not hear the order and were not sure that\n4 a declaration of an unlawful assembly had been\nmade. The order given was in\n5 English only, even though\nmany, if not most, of the people in the park did not\n6 understand English. In addition to members of the\nmedia, legal observers from the\n7 National Lawyers Guild and peaceful\nparticipants in the assembly, families from the\n8 surrounding neighborhood were using the\npark facilities. Even for those who spoke\n9 English and heard the garbled order, there\nwas no direction as to how to disperse\n10 other than to leave the park. As a result, chaos ensued\nas people began to run, and the\n11 police began to chase them, indiscriminately shooting less-lethal\nmunitions and using\n12 baton strikes against the media, peaceful\nparticipants in the First Amendment\n13 assembly, women with their children, and others\nlawfully using the Park.\n14 8. The pretext for the LAPD's action\nwas the purported behavior of a small\n15 number of individuals who reacted to the sudden\npresence of riot-gear clad officers\n16 —their\nidentities obscured by face shields and vests and other\nequipment covering\n17 their badges —with\nweapons drawn at what had been a peaceful and lawifil assembly\n18 for nearly an hour before the\nappearance of the officers along Alvarado on the east\n19 side of the Park. These few individuals posed\nno harm to any police officers or\n20 civilians, at worst threw a few empty water bottles,\npaper and oranges at police, and\n21 were in an area away from the bulk of the\npersons assembled, and could easily have\n22 been isolated from the peaceful participants gathered in the\nsoccer field. Rather than\n23 isolating and dealing with the small number of\npeople who were throwing things,\n24 LAPD declared the entire gathering an \"unlawful\nassembly\" and ordered all of the\n25 peaceful participants to disperse. There was no lawful justification for this\npolice\n26 action as even the limited\nresponse of a few persons to the earlier police\n27\n28\n\ndemonstration of force had ended approximately 30 minutes before the police swept\n1\n2 through the park, assaulting anyone in their path.\n3 9. Shortly after the march first arrived at the MacArthur Park rally site at\n4 approximately 5:00 the LAPD made a show of force with officers positioned\np.m.,\n5 acrossthe west end of Wilshire near Park View. The officers wore riot helmets with\n6 faceshields down and batons drawn. Victor Narro, who had obtained the permit for\n7 the event and met with the police in the weeks before the event to discuss its\n8 implementation, was told by Defendant Deputy Chief Carter to move the\n9 demonstrators off the street or the police would do it. As the demonstration\n10 organizers began to move the remaining marchers into the park, riot-gear clad officers\n11 with batons drawn began marching east on Wilshire toward the demonstrators. The\n12 marchers in the street were delayed in entering the park because the sidewalk was\n13 crowded with families and other marchers who stopped to watch the police line.\n14 After advancing approximately 50 to 100 feet, the police stopped. Over the next 5\nto 10 minutes, the marchers continued to move into the park and clear the street.\n15\n16 When nearly all of the marchers had left the street, the police then returned to their\n17 prior position at Park Viçw and Wilshire Boulevard.\n18 10. Organizers of the rally attempted to cooperate with LAPD to ensure the\n19 lawful assembly would continue. Only a handfl.il of individuals remained in the\n20 street. At the request of Deputy Chief Carter, a representative of the rally organizers\n21 utilized the amplification system on a police vehicle to advise the few individuals still\n22 in the street to enter the park. The vehicle was parked behind the police line. All but\n23 approximately two dozen individuals complied with the order. The remaining\n24 persons in the street were isolated and isolatable from the lawful assembly, which\n25 continuedpeacefully.\n26 11. It took a considerable time for all of the thousands of marchers to reach the\n27\n28\n\n1 Park. The last group of marchers were the Aztec dancers, who haveparticipated in\n2 nearly every major march and rally in the City for thepast several years. The dancers\n3 are predominantly women and children. When the Aztec dancers reached MacArthur\n4 Park, they closed the march with a symbolic dance circle in Alvarado. As\nthey\n5 engaged in their traditional dances on May 1 at approximately 5:30to 5:40 p.m. in\n6 Alvarado Boulevard, LAPD motorcycle officers used theirmotorcycles as a means\n7 of crowd control, riding their vehicles into the marchers and thosegathered to watch\n8 them, which included many women and small children. At about the\nsame time, riot-\n9 gear clad officers moved in on foot and shoved the\ngroup with batons even as the\n10 peaceful dancers and onlookers repeatedly stated that theywere moving as directed.\nii All ofthis was done without warning and without sufficient\nopportunity for the Aztec\n12 dancers to collect their drums and other property. Although the\npeople were angry\n13 with the police action, they complied with orders, stepping on to the sidewalk\n14 adjacent to Alvarado.\n15 12. At approximately 6:00 p.m., the policepresence began to build even more\n16 on Alvarado Boulevard between 7th Street and Wilshire Boulevard,forming a near\n17 solid line of officers in the street. Several hundred people were gathered\non the\n18 public sidewalk and the adjoining grass, watching the police line. The police then\n19 ordered everyone to get off the public sidewalk and move onto thegrass. As those\n20 in the park watched, additional officers arrived and lined Alvarado.\n21 13. At approximately 6:15 p.m., still more officers in riot\ngear appeared along\n22 7th Street, south of the park. The pretext for this increased police presence was to\n23 address a small group of demonstrators who were \"taunting\" the police but in\nreality\n24 the deliberate intention of the LAPD was to breakup a lawful demonstration. The\n25 police could readily have isolated this group and removed them from the Park.\n26 Instead, the police pushed the supposed \"agitators\" into those lawfully assembled in\n27\n28\n\n1 the park. As the peaceful participants simply stood in the park, behind the sidewalk,\n2 the police line at 7th Streetand Alvarado began moving north into the park. At this\n3 point in time, no dispersal order had been given and no objects had been thrown at\n4 the police other than a single can that LAPD radio transmissions minimized and\n5 stated fell far short of striking an officer. With riot helmets on, batons drawn and\n6 rifles aimed to shoot less-lethal munitions, the officers advanced on the peaceful\n7 participants. As they neared the peaceful participants, the officers used their batons\n8 to shove anyone in their path and to hit people with batons, indiscriminately.\n9 14. As the line of police officers advanced, people began to walk away from\n10 them. The line of officers had advanced only a few feet into the park when several\n11 officers began shooting foam batons and other munitions at the people in front of\n12 them. In response, nearly everyone in the area began to run. Some of the children\n13 who had been in the park began crying as they ran with their mothers to escape the\n14 shots being fired.\n15 15. Dozens of individuals were shot at close range as officers simply unloaded\n16 their weapons at anyone in the area. At the same time, officers shoved and struck\n17 virtually anyone with whom they came in contact. The indiscriminate actions of the\n18 officers were exemplified when they came upon a homeless man who had been\n19 sleeping in the park. Officers grabbed him, dragged him to his feet, then started\n20 shoving and hitting him to force him to leave the park.\n21 16. Only after the police line had assaulted the peaceful participants for several\n22 minutes was any announcement made of an \"unlawful assembly.\" The announcement\n23 was made from a helicopter overhead. The purported announcement was largely\n24 unintelligible, particularly with the noise of the helicopter compounded by the\n25 screamingand crying of the peaceful participants who were being shot, beaten and\n26 shoved by the line officers. Many ofthose present, including LAPD officers, did not\n27\n-6-\n28\n\n1 hear the announcement. The announcement\nwas made only in English, despite the\n2 fact that both the neighborhood where the\nrally was held and most of the rally\n3 participants are primarily Spanish-speaking\nimmigrants. Finally, the announcement\n4 gave no directions regarding dispersal other than to declarean \"unlawful assembly.\"\n5 17. The police line continued to\nsweep north, crossing Wilshire Boulevard.\n6 Asthe officers moved north,\nanyone in their path was the target of baton strikes and\n7 other force as the officers continued to fire less-lethal rounds\nindiscriminately into the\n8 crowd. While the peaceful participants ran in\nan attempt to elude the projectiles and\n9 batonstrikes, lines ofofficers blocked Alvarado and Wilshire\nBoulevards, preventing\n10 people from leaving the park to the north or the\neast, forcing some individuals back\n11 toward the advancing officers who were using force.\nAlthough the LAPD officers\n12 were forcing people out of the park on to 6th Street, the LAPD did\nnot stop vehicular\n13 traffic on 6th Street, creating a dangerous situation for\npeaceful participants as they\n14 attempted to comply with some unknown orders to\ndisperse. In one incident, a car\n15 traveling on 6th Street stopped short to avoid hitting\na woman attempting to flee with\n16 one of her children in tow.\n17 18. During the time that the LAPD was engaging in this riotous conduct\n18 against peaceful participants, a small\ngroup of demonstrators, numbering no more\n19 than a dozen or so, occupied the northeast corner of the intersection\nof 6th and\n20 Alvarado. In response to the earlier incident in which the\npolice rode their\n21 motorcycles into the Aztec dancers, the\ngroup chanted at the police in the intersection\n22 and lobbed empty water bottles and small objects in the direction of the\npolice. With\n23 approximately 600 officers on hand, the LAPD outnumbered thissmall group of\n24 demonstrators nearly 15 to 1, yet no attempt was made to isolate the\ngroup and permit\n25 the lawful assembly to continue. Instead, the LAPD used\nan unwarranted and\n26 unlawful show of force against peaceful participants to intimidate them into\nforegoing\n27\n28 -7-\n\n1 the lawful exercise of their First Amendment rights.\n2 19. At or around this same time, a man in a motorized wheelchair entered the\n3 intersection twice to criticize the police. Officers at one point pinned the man's hands\n4 behind his back, but then released him.\n5 20. LAPD officers chased hundreds of people assembled in the park,\n6 regardless of whether they had engaged in any unlawful activity, participated in the\n7 rally, or simply come to the park for fresh air with their children, hitting them with\n8 baton, shooting them with so-called \"less lethal\" munitions, including foam batons\n9 and sponge rounds designed to incapacitate the target, and driving all in their path,\n10 including those not participating in the march, from the Park. LAPD officers did not\n11 use such force to effectuate arrest, overcome resistence to arrest, or in self-defense.\n12 The peaceful participants did not resist arrest, attempt to escape arrest, use force upon\n13 any person, or threaten to use force upon any person.\n14 21. LAPD officers fired their \"less lethal\" weapons indiscriminately into the\n15 people in the park, aiming at and striking in the upper torsos of peaceful participants,\n16 contrary to manufacturer's warnings. Although the munitions used on May Day were\n17 \"target specific,\" as opposed to the \"stinger\" rounds used at demonstrations in the\n18 past, virtually none of the \"targets\" had committed any unlawful act, justifying such\n19 use of force. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege that LAPD\n20 officers deliberately fired at the upper torsos of peaceful participants, based on their\n21 training and with the approval of LAPD command staff. But even if the officers had\n22 done nothing more than shoot indiscriminately at the lower torso area of the adults,\n23 that put them in direct range of the upper torsos and heads of the children in the park.\n24 It was sheer luck that no child was struck with a projectile given the indiscriminate\n25 deployment of more than 140 rounds of less-lethal munitions at a peaceful, fleeing\n26 assembly. Despite their denomination as \"less-lethal\", such weapons have the\n27\n-8-\n28\n\n1 potential to cause death or great bodily injury under certain\ncircumstances. The\n2 manufacturer's specifications describe these\nmunitions as designed for the\n3 incapacitation of aggressive,\nnon-compliant subjects and designed to inflict serious\n4 pain.\n5 22. There was no probable cause or reasonable\nsuspicion to believe that\n6 peaceful participants posed an immediate\nor credible threat of injury to police or\nany\n7 otherperson.\n8 23. As they swept through the Park\nremoving everyone in sight, LAPD officers\n9 deliberately singled out peaceful participants who were members of the media,\n10 attempting to report on the actions of the\npolice, and subjected them to the same\n11 brutal force as was directed toanyone in the path of the LAPD.\n12 24. Hundreds of peaceful participants\nincluding men, women, and children,\n13 who had been engaged in no criminal activity\n—andwho were attempting to comply\n14 with the LAPD's legally deficient orders to\ndisperse — were\nphysically injured as they\n15 were shot with foam batons, struck with batons and/or\nshoved by the advancing\n16 police lines.\n17 25. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and\non that basis allege that the conduct\n18 complained of herein was undertaken\npursuant to the policies, practices and customs\n19 of the LAPD, an agency of the City of Los\nAngeles, and the City of Los Angeles and\n20 ratified by defendants.\n21\n22 THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IN NA TIONAL\nLAWYERS GUILD\n23 26. In June, 2005, the City of Los Angeles entered into\na settlement\n24 agreement in National Lawyers Guild, et at\nv. City of Los Angeles, et at, CV 01-\n25 6877 FMC (Cwx), an action arising from the\ndisruption of lawful assemblies and use\n26 of unlawful force, including the use of less-lethal\nmunitions, during the Democratic\n27\n28\n\nNational Convention (\"DNC\") in Los Angeles in 2000 and a subsequent\n1\n2 demonstration on October 22, 2000. The settlement provided for six changes in the\n3 policy and practices of the LAPD as applied to demonstrations. At least four of those\n4 provisions were violated in this instance.\n5 27. Under the terms of the settlement in National Lawyers Guild,\n6 demonstrators, while participating in lawful assemblages, are not to be prevented\n7 from using public sidewalks adjacent to a lawful march route.\n8 28. The terms of the settlement also expressly provide that LAPD officers are\n9 not to use their motorcycles as a weapon of crowd control against peaceful\n10 demonstrators.\nii\n29. The terms of the settlement also expressly provide that less lethals may\n12 only be deployed on \"aggresive and/or combative suspects in a crowd control\n13 situation, on suspects who are a potential physical threat to themselves or others, on\n14 suspects armed with weapons other than firearms, or suspects displaying 'aggressive\n15 and/or combative' actions.\"\n16 30. The settlement agreement entered into by the City expressly provided that\n17 \"less lethal weapons should not be used on a lawfully dispersing crowd or\n18 individual.\" In addition, the agreement prohibited the use of less lethal munitions\n19 \"against a person or a crowd that is retreating unless the person or crowd continues\n20 to engage in unlawful activity that is aggressive and/or combative.\"\n21 31. Finally, the settlement provided that, prior to declaring an unlawful\n22 assembly, the LAPD Incident Commander should evaluate the feasibility of isolating\n23 and arresting those responsible for any unlawful conduct, and if feasible, shall take\n24 such action.\n25\n26\n27\n-10-\n28\n\nMONELL ALLEGATIONS\n1\n2 32. The City, through Chief Bratton and the Los\nAngeles Police Department,\n3 has failed to train its officers in the permissible use of less lethal\nweapons to disperse\n4 a demonstration. The need for training in this instance\nwas obvious. The City has\n5 known of the deficiencies in its training since at least 2000 and entered\ninto a\n6 settlement agreement in June 2005, agreeing to revised\npolicies, yet the City has\n7 failed to promulgate policies effectuating the terms of the settlement\nagreement\n8 and/or to train its command staff and its officers on the revised\npolicies, if any exist\n9 33. Chief Bratton, as well as those members of his command staff officers to\n10 whom he has delegated his responsibility to enact and implement lawful\npolicies on\n11 the declaration of an unlawful assembly, the use of less lethalweapons, and the use\n12 of motorcycles as a crowd control tool, are aware of the unlawful\npolicies, practices\n13 and customs of the City and the LAPD which resulted in the settlement in National\n14 Lawyers Guild v. City of Los Angeles in June, 2005. Moreover, Chief Bratton and his\n15 delegated command staff are aware that the use of force to break\nup lawful protests\n16 is a custom so ingrained in the marrow of the LAPD that it was critical to take all\n17 steps necessary to ensure that official policy was implemented in amanner sufficient\n18 to address the deeply rooted custom to violate First Amendment rights in the\nspecific\n19 ways identified in the National Lawyers Guild settlementagreement. The failure to\n20 take such steps directly lead to the injuries suffered by the Plaintiffs.\n21 34. The City paid more than $4,000,000 in damages as a result of thesesame\n22 unlawful practices during the DNC. Subsequent to the DNC, the City\npaid nearly\n23 $1,000,000 for injuries arising from the use of less-lethal\nweapons during a permitted\n24 demonstration on October 22, 2000. Prior to the DNC, the City paid\nnearly\n25 $2,000,000 in damages arising from the dispersal ofpeaceful demonstrations through\n26 force and intimidation. In all of its actions, the City has acted with deliberate\n27\n-11-\n28\n\nindifference to the rights of the public to engage in lawful expressive activity in\n1\n2 traditional public fora within the City.\n3 35. Despite its knowledge that the LAPD has had a history of unlawful\n4 conduct at demonstrations, and its knowledge that there has been a traditional lack\n5 oftraining of LAPD line and command staff on proper law enforcement conduct at\n6 demonstrations, and its agreement in the National Lawyers Guild case, supra,\n7 regardingthe use of force at peaceful demonstrations, the City failed to adequately\n8 train its officers and command staff in, among other things, the rights of\n9 demonstrators, lawful crowd control, dispersal orders, separating those engaged in\n10 unlawfulconduct from those engaged in lawful conduct, the permissible use of batons\n11 incrowd control/demonstration situations, the permissible use of \"less-than-lethal\"\n12 weaponsin crowd control/demonstration situations, and the permissible use of force\n13 andcircumstances justifring it in such situations. This failure amounted to deliberated\n14 indifference to the rights of persons with whom the police come into contact, and\n15 constituted a conscious choice by the City not to properly train its law enforcement\n16 personnelon these issues.\n17 36. On information and belief, ChiefBratton delegated final responsibility and\n18 authorityto persons within his command staff to act as the final policy maker at the\n19 MayDay March to decide whether to declare the assembly unlawful and whether to\n20 useforce. The persons who made these decisions acted as the delegated policy maker\n21 for the City of Los Angeles on these issues. There was no time, opportunity or\n22 procedurefor anyone to review or revise the decisions made by these delegated policy\n23 makersprior to their final implementation.\n24\n25 COMMONALLEGATIONS\n26 37. Defendants improperly declared the assembly unlawful. All with the\n27\n-12-\n28\n\n1\npossible exception of but a handful of the\napproximately 5,000 people assembled in\n2 MacArthur\nPark on May Day for the immigrant workers\nrally, as well as the families\nusing the park for recreational purposes, were peaceful. The few\nprotestors who\nverbally criticized the police, and the even fewer who threw inocuous\nobjects at the\nriot-gear clad police, did not present sufficient, if\nany, justification for declaring the\n6\nassembly unlawful orjustify defendants' infringement on the First\nAmendment rights\nof the vast, peaceful majority. All force used\nto disperse class members after\n8 defendants\nimproperly declared the assembly unlawful was illegal because saidforce\nwas a proximate result of an illegal, unconstitutional dispersal order.\n10\n38. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon\nallege that defendants\ndeclared the gathering an \"unlawful\nassembly,\" and ordered the peaceful participants\n12\nto disperse, and used force upon the peaceful\nparticipants, and singled out persons\n13\nperceived to be members of the media, for the\npurpose of interfering with the First\n14 Amendment\nrights of the peaceful participants.\n15\n39. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon\nallege that, in declaring the\n16\ngathering an \"unlawful assembly,\" and ordering the peaceful\nparticipants to disperse,\n17 and\nusing force upon the peaceful participants, and singling out\npersons perceived to\n18 be members\nof the media, defendants engaged in content-discrimination\nand\n19\nviewpoint-discrimination Defendantst actions were motivated and influenced\nby the\n20\npolitical content, message, and viewpoint of plaintiffs,\nor by defendants' perception\n21 of the\npolitical content, message, and viewpoint of plaintiffs. Defendantstreated\n22\nplaintiffs less favorably than others whose speech has a different\ncontent, message\n23 and\nviewpoint.\n24\nAssumingthat a dispersal order could have been legallyjustified under all\n25 of the facts\nand circumstances, the order given\nwas, nonetheless, deficient as it was\n26\nnot given until after the officers began advancing on and\nfiring at those present in the\n27\n28 -13-\n\n1\npark, was unintelligible as delivered from a helicopter, was given only in English, and\n2 the order failed\nto specify how peaceful participants were todisperse and failed to\n3\ngive the peaceful participants sufficient time or opportunity to disperse. All force\nused to disperse peaceful participants was unreasonable because defendants failed to\nprovide peaceful participants with sufficient time and opportunity to disperse.\n6\n41. Assuming the dispersal order was lawful, and that defendants provided\npeaceful participants with sufficient time and opportunity to disperse, the use of force\n8\nwas nonetheless unlawful because class members never presented any threat to the\npolice nor any other person, and were not committing any act which would justify\nany\n10 use of force. All force used to disperse peaceful participants was unreasonable\nbecause peaceful participants did not present any threat justifying the use of\nany\n12 force. None of the class\nrepresentatives were arrested for acts committed on May 1,\n13 2000.\n14\n42. Defendants' use of force against peaceful participants was unreasonable\n15 because defendants used force\nindiscriminately, including shooting peaceful\n16\nparticipants with projectiles, hitting them with batons, and shoving them, all without\n17\nany individualized justification for the use of such force.\n18\n43. Defendants' use of force was unreasonable because defendants\ngave no\n19\nwarning before using force, including shooting peaceful participants with projectiles\n20\nor hitting them with batons.\n21\nDefendants use of force was unreasonable because defendants utilized\n22\nweapons in an improper and unreasonable manner. Guidelines for the \"less lethal\"\n23\nprojectile weapons carried by defendants specify that, in order to avoid serious injury,\n24 such\nprojectiles should not be aimed at the upper torso and should not be used in a\n25\nnon-target specific manner. Defendants improperly fired projectile weapons directly\n26 at\npeaceful participants' upper bodies, causing physical injuries.\n27\n-14-\n28\n\n1 45. Asa result of defendants' actions, hundreds of peacefl.il participants\nwere\n2\ndeprived of their First, Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights (and\ncorollary state\nlaw rights) and physically and emotionally\ninjured.\n46. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon\nallege that the LAPD\nofficers acted in accordance with orders given them\nby supervisors from the highest\n6 command\npositions, in accordances with policies and procedures instituted\nby the\nLAPD and the City of Los Angeles.\n8\nPARTIES\n10\nThe Class Representative Plaintiffs\n11\nPlaintiff Multi-Ethnic Immigrant Workers\nOrganizing Network\n12\n(\"MI WON\") is a collaborative effort of the Coalition for Humane\nImmigrant Rights\n13 ofLos\nAngeles (\"CHIRLA\"), the Korean Immigrant Workers Alliance(\"KIWA\"), the\n14\nPilipino Workers Center (\"PWC\") and the Garment Workers Center\n(\"GWC\").\nMI WON was formed for the\npurpose of organizing and educating immigrant workers\n16\non their rights.

Whether defendants engaged in content-discrimination and viewpoint-\ndiscrimination.\n16\n17 75. In accordance with F.R. Civ. P. Rule 23(a), there are questions of law\n18 common to the class. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege that the\n19 common questions of law include but are not limited to, the following:\n20 a. Whether defendants were legally justified in declaring the gathering an\n21 unlawful assembly;\n22 b. Whether (assuming the dispersal order was unlawful) any use of force was\n23 lawful;\n24 c. Whether (assuming the dispersal order was lawful) defendants gave\n25 peaceful participants an adequate opportunity to disperse;\n26 d. What degree of force (assuming the dispersal order was lawful), if any,\n27\n-24-\n28\n\ndefendants were permitted to use to disperse the peaceful participants;\n2 e.

Whether defendants were permitted to randomly fife into the\ndispersing\n5 peaceful participants;\n6 g. Whether the force defendants used was constitutionally reasonable.\n7 76. In accordance with F.R. Civ. P. Rule 23(a), the claims of the\nrepresentative\n8 plaintiffs are typical of the class they represent. Each representative\nplaintiff was\n9 presentin or about MacArthur Park on May 1,2007, between the hours of 5:45\np.m.\n10 and 7:30 p.m. Each representative plaintiff was subjected to force in the Parkor as\n11 he or she attempted to disperse from the Park, or as she or he attempted to disperse\n12 along Wilshire Boulevard, Alvarado Boulevard, 7th Street and/or Park View, or in the\n13 vicinity of those streets. No representative plaintiff did anything to attack or threaten\n14 to attack any person, or interfere with any lawful action ofanyone, or resist arrest, or\n15 escape. Except for their presence at the Park, and peaceful, verbal, non-violent\n16 protests, and observing defendants, plaintiffs did nothing. Defendants had no legal\n17 justification for ordering any representative plaintiff to disperse and no legal\n18 justification for using force against any representative plaintiff.\n19 77. Each representative plaintiff has the same interests and suffered thesame\n20 type injuries as the class members. The claims of each representative plaintiff arose\n21 because of LAPD's dispersal orders and use of force against the peaceful participants.\n22 The claims of the representative plaintiffs are based upon the same legal theories as\n23 the claims of the class members. Each representative class member suffered actual\n24 physical injuries as a result of defendants' dispersal orders and defendants' use of\n25 force.\n26 78. In accordance with F.R. Civ. P. Rule 23(a), the representative plaintiffs\n27\n-25-\n28\n\n1 will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. The interests ofthe\n2 representative plaintiffs are consistent with and not antagonistic to the interests of the\n3 class.\n4 79. In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(1)(A), prosecutions of\n5 separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk that\n6 inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class\n7 would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the parties opposing the class.\n8 80. In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)( 1 )(B), prosecutions of\n9 separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk of\n10 adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would, as a\n11 practical matter, substantially impair or impede the interests of the other members of\n12 the class to protect theft interests.\n13 81. In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(2), the Defendants have acted,\n14 threaten to act, and will continue to act on grounds generally applicable to the class,\n15 thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or declaratory relief with respect\n16 to the class as a whole.\n17 82. In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(3), the questions of law or fact\n18 common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only\n19 individual members. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege that the\n20 questions of law and/or fact which predominate over any question affecting only\n21 individual members include whether defendants improperly declared an unlawful\n22 assembly depriving peaceful participants of theft First Amendment rights, whether\n23 defendants used excessive force against peaceful participants, whether defendants'\n24 motivation was to deprive the peaceful participants of theft First Amendment rights,\n25 and whether defendants engaged in content-discrimination and viewpoint-\n26 discrimination.\n27\n-26-\n28\n\n83. In accordance with Fed.R.Cjv,P. Rule\n1 23(b)(3), this class action is superior\n2 to other available methods for the fair and efficient\nadjudication of the controversy\n3 between the parties. Plaintiffs are informed and believe\nand thereon allege that the\n4 interest of members of the class in\nindividually controlling the prosecution of a\n5 separate action is low, in that most class members would be unable to individually\n6 prosecute any action at all. Plaintiffs are informed and believe\nand thereon allege that\n7 the amounts at stake for individuals are so small that\nseparate suits would be\n8 impossible or impracticable. Plaintiffs are informed and\nbelieve and thereon allege\n9 that most members of the class will not be able to find\ncounsel to represent them.\n10 Plaintiffs are informed and believe that defendants have\nno or virtually no records or\n11 evidence of any kind justifying\nany use of force against individual peaceful\n12 participants, and that defendants' only justifications for\nany use of force against\n13 peaceful participants is based on facts which\napply to all peaceful participants\n14 equally.\n15 84. Plaintiffs are informed and believe that it is desirable\nto concentrate all\n16 litigation in one forum because all of the claims arise in the\nsame location, date and\n17 time, i.e., in the vicinity of MacArthur Park on\nMay 1, 2007, between 5:45p.m. and\n18 7:30 p.m., and it will promote judicial efficiency to resolve thecommon questions of\n19 law and fact in one forum, rather than in multiple courts.\n20 85. Plaintiffs do not know the identities of all of the class members.Plaintiffs\n21 are aware of the identities of approximately 50\nclass members. Plaintiffs are\n22 informed and believe and thereon allege that the identities of\nmost class members\n23 may be obtained from organizations which sponsored the march and\nrally, including\n24 MIWON, CHIRLA, KIWA, PWC, GWC and IDEPSCA. Plaintiffsare informed and\n25 believe and thereon allege that the identities of class members\nmay be obtained from\n26 calls for assistance made to MIWON, CHIRLA, KIWA, PWC, GWC andIDEPSCA.\n27\n28 -27•\n\n86. In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(3), class members must be\n1\n2 furnished with the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including\n3 individual notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort.\n4 Plaintiffs contemplate notice through organizational \"hotlines\" devoted to the events\n5 of May 1, 2007, distribution of leaflets in MacArthur Park, as well as calls to the\n6 numbers for Plaintiffs' counsel provided in the Spanish language media. Plaintiffs\n7 contemplate that the notice will inform class members of the following:\n8 a. The pendency of the class action, and the issues common to the class;\n9 b. The nature of the action;\n10 c. Their right to 'opt out' of the action within a given time, in which event they\n11 will not be bound by a decision rendered in the class action;\n12 d. Their right, if they do not 'opt out,' to be represented by their own counsel\n13 and enter an appearance in the case; otherwise, they will be represented by the\n14 named plaintiffs and their counsel; and\n15 e. Their right, if they do not 'opt out,' to share in any recovery in favor of the\n16 class, and conversely to be bound by any judgment on the common issues,\n17 adverse to the class.\n18\n19 FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF\n20 FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND ASSOCIATION\n21 (1st and 14th Amendments, 42 U.S.C. Section 1983)\n22 (All the class representatives, individually and on behalf of the class\n23 they seek to represent, against all defendants)\n24 87.

The actions of the defendants, as set forth above, violated plaintiffs' right\n27\n-28-\n28\n\n1 to freedom of speech and association guaranteed by the First Amendment of the\n2 United States Constitution.\n3 89. As a proximate result of the wrongful, malicious and violent acts of\n4 defendants, and the fright caused plaintiffs, plaintiffs and each ofthem, suffered\n5 physical injuries and experienced shock and injury to thenervous system and were\n6 injured in their health, strength and activity, suffering extreme andsevere mental\n7 anguish and physical pain, anxiety, humiliation and emotional distress.\n8 90. By reason of the aforementioned acts and omissions of defendants and the\n9 City of Los Angeles, plaintiffs, and each of them, have incurred and will incur inthe\n10 future, medical and related expenses, past and future lost earnings, loss of\nproperty\n11 and other special and general damages, in an amount according toproof, but in excess\n12 of the jurisdictional limits of this court.\n13 91. In doing the foregoing wrongful acts, defendants, and each of them, acted\n14 in intentional, reckless andlor callous disregard for the constitutional\nrights of\n15 plaintiffs. The wrongful acts, and each of them, were willful, oppressive, fraudulent\n16 and malicious.\n17\n18 SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF\n19 THREATS, INTIMIDATION OR COERCION\n20 FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND ASSOCIATION\n21 (Civil Code Section 52.1)\n22 (All class representatives, individually and on behalf of the class\n23 they seek to represent, against all defendants)\n24 92.

RECITALS \nThe Class Representative Plaintiffs filed the above-captioned action in the \n16 \nUnited States District Court for the Central District of California (\"Court\") on May \n17 \n9,2007. The several Related Cases were filed in the Central District as well. \n18 \nThe Class Representative Plaintiffs asserted they represented a class of \n19 \npersons who were subjected to violation of their First and Fourth Amendment \n20 \nrights, as well as other federal constitutional rights and rights under California state \n21 \nlaw, as a result of actions by the Los Angeles Police Department (\"LAPD\"), an \n22 \nagency of the City, surrounding a protest at MacArthur Park on May I, 2007 (\"May \n23 \nI \"). The Class Representative Plaintiffs alleged that the LAPD and its personnel, \n24 \npursuant to policy, violated their rights by, among other things, declaring an \n25 \nunlawful assembly and engaging in excessive force. \n26 \nOver the objections and opposition of the City and other defendants named in \n27 \nthe above-captioned case brought by plaintiff Multi-Ethnic Immigrant Workers \n28 \nOrganizing Network (\"MIWON\"), the Court certified a damages class and an \n3 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 20 of 98\n1  injunctive class on January 8,2008. Subsequently, the parties engaged in extensive \n2  settlement negotiations over six sessions with United States District Court \n3  Magistrate Judge Carla Woehrle (\"Judge Woehrle\"). This settlement, which the \n4  parties have reached through arms-length negotiations with the assistance of Judge \n5  Woehrle, is the result of those negotiations. \n6  The Defendants, the plaintiffs in the MIWON case, and the plaintiffs in the \n7  Related Cases, now agree that they wish to avoid the cost, time and risks involved \n8  in further litigation of these cases and to bring an end to the litigation. \n9  Therefore, the parties agree as follows: \n10  II.  DEFINITIONS \n11  1.  \"Administrator\" means the claims administrator chosen by the \n12  Plaintiffs and to be appointed by the Court to administer the claims process, pay \nclass claims, cause (if needed) English-language documents disseminated to class \n13 \n14  members to be translated into Spanish prior to dissemination, issue deficiency \nnotices, publish summary Class Notice, discharge other duties set forth in this \n15 \nSettlement Agreement and handle other tasks necessary and appropriate to \n16 \ncompleting the claims process. \n17 \n2.

A Represented \n24 \nIndividual requests exclusion from the settlement either by failing to provide \n25 \nhislher counsel with a signed authorization or by providing written notice to the \n26 \nCourt and parties of hislher intent to exclude him or herself, in either case no later \n27 \nMIWON counsel intend to advise the Court of the amounts they calculated for the \n1 \n28  non-MIWON  counsel  based  on  the  information  made  available  to  MIWON \n9 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 26 of 98\n1  than the Bar Date. \n2  III.  DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY; NO ADMISSION OR WAIVER \n3  20.  This Settlement Agreement is for settlement purposes only. Nothing in \n4  the Settlement Agreement, its exhibits or other documents incorporated herein shall \n5  be construed as, or deemed to be evidence of, a waiver of any defense or legal \n6  position otherwise available to any of the Defendants or any other persons. Neither \n7  the fact of settlement nor any provision contained in this Settlement Agreement, its \n8  exhibits or other documents incorporated herein, nor any party's or other person's \n9  performance hereunder shall constitute or be admissible anywhere as (a) evidence \n10  establishing or otherwise relating to any claim for relief or any fact alleged by any \nRepresented Individual, Unrepresented Class Member or other person, whether in \n11 \n12  this action or in any other pending or future action or proceeding; or (b) evidence of \n13  any wrongdoing, fault, violation oflaw, or liability of any kind on the part of any \n14  Defendant or other Released Person. The Defendants make no admission of any \n15  claim, allegation or fact in the MIWON case, the Related Cases or any other action \n16  or proceeding whatsoever.  Rather they deny all allegations of wrongdoing and \ndeny any liability whatever to the Represented Individuals, to any Unrepresented \n17 \nClass Member or to any other person. This Settlement Agreement does not create, \n18 \nand is not intended to create, any rights belonging to any non-parties, except as \n19 \notherwise expressly provided herein. \n20 \nIV.  TERMS OF SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT FOR DAMAGES \n21 \n21.  The parties enter into this Settlement Agreement solely for the \n22 \npurposes of this settlement and its implementation. If the Settlement Agreement \n23 \ndoes not receive final court approval as provided herein, then this Settlement \n24 \nAgreement shall have no effect whatever, and the parties shall in all respects return \n25 \nto their positions ex ante; provided, however, that said return to the parties' \n26 \npositions ex ante shall not entitle any party to reimbursement of costs already \n27 \nincurred under this Settlement Agreement, except as otherwise expressly provided \n28 \ncounsel.. \n10 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 27 of 98\n1  herein. \n2  22.  The total monetary settlement in the MIWON and Related Cases \n3  collectively, including all payments to Represented Individuals and Unrepresented \n4  Class Members, and all payments for class administration (except for special \n5  payments for activities requested by the City as provided in Paragraph 54), is \n6  $12,850,000. Payment of said amount shall be the obligation of the City and no \n7  other Defendant or person. The City intends to use the proceeds from one or more \n8  Judgment Obligation Bonds (hereafter the \"Judgment Bond\") to fund the Consent \n9  Judgment resulting from this settlement. The City will deposit the funds required \n10  under this Settlement Agreement forthwith after it receives the proceeds of the sale \n11  of the Judgment Bond, the purpose of such sale being to fund the instant settlement. \n12  The parties will use their best efforts to facilitate receipt of such funds within 120 \ndays of the Effective Date. If, after six months from the Effective Date, the \n13 \n14  Judgment Bond has not been sold, the City will provide a report to the Court and \n15  Class Counsel regarding how it plans to fund the settlement. The failure or inability \nof the City to sell the Judgment Bond shall not be cause for the City to rescind the \n16 \nSettlement Agreement. The Consent Judgment shall in any event be considered a \n17 \nfinal non-appealable judgment, collectible under the same legal standard as any \n18 \nfinal judgment in federal court that has not been appealed, except as otherwise \n19 \nprovided in this Settlement Agreement. Other provisions of this paragraph \n20 \nnotwithstanding, the City shall advance to the Litt, Estuar, Harrison & Kitson \n21 \nClient Trust Account\" $50,000 of the $250,000 constituting the Class Fund (the \n22 \n\"Advance Payment\") for: dissemination of Class Notices and publication of \n23 \nsummary Class Notices; processing of class claims; and other reasonably necessary \n24 \nclass-administration activities after the Court issues its preliminary approval, \n25 \nincluding other class administration activities set forth in the Settlement \n26 \nAgreement. In the event no Consent Judgment becomes final, or if the Settlement \n27 \nAgreement is rescinded, any portion of the Advance Payment that the \n28 \nAdministrator has used, including sums paid to organizations pursuant to Paragraph \n11 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 28 of 98\n1  46, infra, shall not be refundable; portions of the Advance Payment that the \n2  Administrator has not used shall be refundable.  Should the total amount required \n3  by the Administrator exceed $50,000, such additional funds shall be drawn from the \n4  $200,000 otherwise designated for payment of claims to Unrepresented Class \n5  Members. \n6  23.  The Represented Individuals' Fund amount of$12,600,000 shall be \n7  applied to settle all the claims of all the Represented Individuals, including all \n8  attorney's fees, all liens and costs.  Counsel for the MIWON Represented \n9  Individuals and counsel for the other Represented Individuals have agreed among \n10  themselves on the amounts that each of the Represented Individuals will receive. \nEach Represented Individual, except Missing Represented Individuals, who are \n11 \n12  addressed elsewhere in this Settlement Agreement, either has agreed or is expected \n13  to agree, to settle hereunder in exchange for the amount designated for him/her by \n14  counsel. (See Paragraph 28 for the City's right to rescind this Settlement \n15  Agreement should the City fail to receive a signed authorization evidencing such \n16  agreement.) Counsel for the MIWON Represented Individuals and counsel for the \nother Represented Individuals have also agreed among themselves on the amounts \n17 \nand manner in which attorney's fees included within the Represented Individuals' \n18 \nFund will be distributed among counsel; provided, however, that non-MIWON \n19 \nRepresented Individuals might have agreements with their counsel regarding \n20 \npercentage divisions of their settlements as a means of determining attorney's fees. \n21 \n24.  It is expressly understood that Plaintiffs' potential claim for statutory \n22 \nattorney's fees was a substantial factor in arriving upon the final settlement amount \n23 \nof$12,850,000. Although the parties did not set a specific figure for attorney's fees \n24 \nin agreeing upon the final settlement amount, they understood that the statutory \n25 \nattorney's-fee claim materially and substantially increased the final settlement \n26 \namount from what it otherwise would have been. \n27 \n25.  Except as provided under Paragraph 29, infra, and subject to the terms \n28  of Paragraph 22, supra, the City shall transfer the total settlement amount of \n12 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 29 of 98\n1  $12,850,000 via wire transfer into the \"Litt, Estuar, Harrison & Kitson Client Trust \n2  Account\". \n3  26.  After the City advances the total settlement amount referenced in the \n4  preceding paragraph into the Litt, Estuar, Harrison & Kitson Client Trust Account, \n5  a portion of that amount shall be distributed to the Trust Accounts of plaintiffs' \n6  counsel in each of the Related Cases as agreed to among all Plaintiffs' counsel. \n7  (The MIWON counsel will determine separately and among themselves how to \n8  divide attorney's fees among themselves and how to distribute the funds to the \n9  Represented Individuals they represent.) The amounts to go to each Trust Account, \n10  which constitute the complete payments to each attorney and hislher clients, \n11  inclusive of attorney's fees, client damages and all liens and costs, if any, are as \n12  follows: \nA.  Gregory Yates: $525,000 \n13 \nB.  Ellen Ellison: $40,000 \n14 \nC.  Susan Pintar: $530,000 \n15 \nD.  Luis Carrillo: $2,090,000 \n16 \nE.  Louis Krass: $50,000 \n17 \nF.  Carl Douglas: $352,000 \n18 \nG.  Leo Hernandez: $38,000 \n19 \nH.  Jaime Segall-Gutierrez: $241,000. At an earlier stage in this \n20 \nlitigation, Mr. Segall-Gutierrez represented the following individuals: \n21 \nSummer Reese, for herself and as guardian for her minor child Patrick \n22 \nReese; Geneva Reese; Ed Cotton; Pedro Reyes; Tania Torres; Miguel \n23 \nGuzman; and Nadia Khan. Those individuals are no longer represented by \n24 \nMr. Segall-Gutierrez, and they will be paid directly from the Litt, Estuar et \n25 \nal. Client Trust Account. \n26 \n1.  Litt, Estuar et al. (for MIWON): $8,984,000 (which includes the \n27 \nentire $250,000 Class Fund). \n28 \n27.  It is expressly understood and agreed upon that any and all disputes, or \n13 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 30 of 98\n1  resolution of such disputes, between or among any of the Plaintiffs, or between or \n2  among counsel for any of the Plaintiffs, or between or among any Plaintiffs, on the \n3  one hand, and their counsel, on the other, over any apportionment, division or \n4  transfer of the total settlement amount under the terms of Paragraph 26, supra, shall \n5  not entitle any such plaintiff or any such counsel to any relief whatever against the \n6  City or other Released Person, or impose any duty of any kind upon the City or \n7  other Released Person. Plaintiffs and their counsel shall hold the City and all other \n8  Released Persons harmless in any dispute, or for any alleged wrong, in any way \n9  arising out of any and all distributions referenced in Paragraph 26, supra. Plaintiffs \n10  and their respective counsel, as reflected in Exhibit E, shall respectively hold the \n11  City and all other Released Persons harmless with regard to any dispute, or alleged \n12  wrong, in any way relating to any claim by any third-party lienholder to any \n13  amount distributed to any Represented Individual herein; provided, however, that \n14  the Plaintiffs and their counsel shall only hold the City harmless under the terms of \nthis sentence to the extent that counsel for the debtor-plaintiff(s) in issue have \n15 \nreceived notice of the subject lien(s) on or before the date that the City has \n16 \ndeposited the total settlement amount into the Litt, Estuar, Harrison & Kitson Client \n17 \nTrust Account. Plaintiffs hereby expressly acknowledge receipt of the Notice of \n18 \nLien issued upon the assets of Tomasa Alvarez by LACIUSC Medical Center and \n19 \nissued by USCB, Inc. by way of letter dated December 29,2008; and Plaintiffs also \n20 \nexpressly acknowledge receipt of the Notice of Lien upon the assets of Antonio \n21 \nLopez by Presbyterian Community and issued by Health Advocates by way of letter \n22 \ndated January 28,2008. \n23 \n28.  Class Counsel shall provide a signed authorization from each \n24 \nRepresented Individual agreeing to the terms of the settlement as it relates to that \n25 \nRepresented Individual, redacted to omit personal identifying information other \n26 \nthan the Represented Individual's name and attorney, to counsel for the City, either \n27  by personal delivery or facsimile, no later than the Bar Date. The City shall be \n28  entitled to treat Class Counsel's failure to provide such a signed authorization for \n14 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 31 of 98\n1  any Represented Individual as that Represented Individual's request for exclusion \n2  from the settlement.  If any Represented Individual requests exclusion from the \n3  settlement or is otherwise excluded from the Settlement, the City shall be entitled to \n4  rescind the Settlement Agreement within 20 days after the Bar Date or date of \n5  exclusion, whichever is later.  Rescission shall return the MIWON and Related \n6  Cases to active litigation status; shall provide Plaintiffs the right to reinstate all \n7  dismissed individual defendants; and shall revoke and withdraw any and all \n8  releases from liability provided by such individual defendants.  In addition, the \n9  tolling of the statute of limitations shall terminate for the claims for relief against \n10  the individual defendants previously dismissed (such statute(s) of limitations \n11  having been tolled at the time of the dismissal) on the earlier of (a) 30 days after the \n12  rescission or (b) the filing of a notice of reinstatement of claims filed with the \n13  Court. In the event the City exercises a right of rescission in accordance with this \n14  paragraph, any funds that it has paid or otherwise has transferred or deposited \n15  pursuant to this Settlement Agreement shall be returned to it within 10 days of the \nrescission, less any expenses, fees and costs incurred by the Administrator, such \n16 \ncosts to include all sums paid to organizations pursuant to Paragraph 46, infra; \n17 \nprovided, however, that the Administrator shall make a written accounting, to \n18 \ncounsel for the City and to Class Counsel, of all such fees and costs.  The \n19 \nAdministrator shall forward its written accounting at the same time it returns any \n20 \nfunds to the City pursuant to this paragraph. \n21 \n29.  Despite the provisions of Paragraph 26, this Settlement Agreement \n22 \ncontemplates that there may be some structured settlements for individual plaintiffs. \n23 \nTo the extent there are such structured settlements, the City will enter into the \n24 \nappropriate agreements not in conflict with this Settlement Agreement or terms of \n25 \nthe Consent Judgment, and will follow any payment instructions it receives \n26 \npursuant to such structured settlements prior to directing payment of settlement \n27  funds into the Litt, Estuar, Harrison & Kitson Client Trust Account. To the extent \n28  there are such structured settlements, the City will deduct payments made pursuant \n15 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 32 of 98\n1  to such instructions from the amount subsequently transferred into the Litt, Estuar, \n2  Harrison & Kitson Client Trust Account. The City shall not enter into any \n3  structured-settlement agreements or follow any payment instructions thereunder \n4  after it directs payment to be made into the Litt, Estuar, Harrison & Kitson Client \n5  Trust Account. This Settlement Agreement fixes the total amount that the City will \n6  be responsible to pay Plaintiffs collectively, either directly or in the form of a \n7  structured settlement. To the extent there are structured settlements, they will be \n8  negotiated by counsel for individual Represented Individuals, memorialized in \n9  individual settlement agreements, and provided to the Court prior to entry of the \n10  Consent Judgment. No structured settlement shall increase the total cost of this \nsettlement to the City or impose any obligations or duties of any kind upon any \n11 \ndefendant or Released Person other than the City whatever.  Once the Consent \n12 \nJudgment becomes final, it is the Consent Judgment that constitutes the binding \n13 \nsettlement terms among the parties. Plaintiffs and their counsel shall hold harmless \n14 \nall Defendants or other Released Persons with regard to any dispute between or \n15 \namong any Plaintiffs, between or among any Plaintiffs' counsel, or between or \n16 \namong any Plaintiffs, on the one hand, and Plaintiffs' counsel, on the other, in any \n17 \nway related to any structured settlement. \n18 \n30.  Upon deposit of the total settlement amount into the Litt, Estuar, \n19 \nHarrison & Kitson Client Trust Account, payment of the Post Administration Class \n20 \nFund shall issue therefrom to the Administrator to permit payment of claims to \n21 \nUnrepresented Class Members who file timely Proof of Claim Forms that the \n22 \nAdministrator does not rej ect. Each such payment shall be issued in an amount not \n23 \nto exceed $1000. In the event that there are more such claims than can be paid in \n24 \nthe amount of $1000 from the Post Administration Class Fund without depleting it, \n25 \nthen the Post Administration Class Fund will be distributed proportionally to each \n26 \nUnrepresented Class Member who files a timely Proof of Claim Form that the \n27 \nAdministrator does not reject. If, after payment to each Unrepresented Class \n28 \nMember the amount owed under the terms of this paragraph, there are funds \n16 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 33 of 98\n1  remaining in the Post Administration Class Fund, then that remaining amount shall \n2  revert to the City. Whether or not a portion of the Post Administration Class Fund \n3  remains for reversion to the City, the Administrator shall make a written \n4  accounting, to counsel for the City and to Class Counsel, of all sums, fees, costs \n5  and expenses paid from the Class Fund, including from the Advance Payment. The \n6  Administrator shall make the accounting within 60 days from the date the \n7  Administrator receives the Post Administration Class Fund for disbursement. Along \n8  with the accounting, the Administrator shall provide Class Counsel and counsel for \n9  the City with a written report listing the total number of Proof of Claims Forms it \n10  received, the total number of claims it paid, and the total number of claims it \n11  rejected broken down by the reasons for rejection.  The City makes no \n12  representations about, and makes no guarantee to any person with regard to, the \n13  amount that will ultimately constitute the Post Administration Class Fund.  All \n14  Plaintiffs and their counsel shall hold the City and all other Released Persons \n15  harmless in any dispute in any way arising from the determination of the amount \nconstituting the Post Administration Class Fund or any transfer or distribution of \n16 \nany portion of the Post Administration Class Fund. \n17 \n31.  If the City fails to exercise any right of rescission pursuant to this \n18 \nSettlement Agreement, then after all such rights to rescind have expired, but before \n19 \nentry of the Consent Judgment, Plaintiffs shall dismiss from the above-captioned \n20 \nMIWON case and from all the Related Cases, all defendants other than the City, \n21 \nincluding each and every defendant other than the City named in the Related Cases \n22 \nlisted in Paragraph 4, supra; provided, however, that in the event the Matters \n23 \nAlleged in the Lawsuit are not resolved with a Consent Judgment that becomes \n24 \nfinal, such dismissed defendants shall be reinstated to permit the parties to proceed \n25 \nupon the Matters Alleged in the Lawsuit as the parties deem appropriate. In the \n26 \nevent of reinstatement, the applicable statute(s) of limitations governing claims for \n27 \nrelief related to Matters Alleged in the Lawsuit for each such reinstated defendant \n28  shall be tolled from the date of dismissal to the earlier of (a) 30 days after the \n17 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 34 of 98\n1  rescission or (b) the filing of a notice of reinstatement of claims filed with the \n2  Court .. Plaintiffs shall lose any right of reinstatement once the total settlement \n3  amount is deposited into the Litt, Estuar, Harrison & Kitson Client Trust Account. \n4  Notwithstanding this paragraph or any other paragraph in this Settlement \n5  Agreement, Plaintiffs shall promptly dismiss from the MIWON case and all Related \n6  Cases any defendant other than the City once Class Counsel receives a document, \n7  signed by that defendant, containing the defendant's (a) release of all Plaintiffs \n8  from any and all liability, claims for relief or actions in any way arising from the \n9  Matters Alleged in the Lawsuit, (b) acknowledgement that the defendant's \n10  dismissal under the terms of this sentence shall be withdrawn, and the defendant \nreinstated into all cases from which the defendant had been dismissed under the \n11 \n12  terms of this paragraph, should the instant settlement fail to produce a Consent \n13  Judgment that becomes final, and (c) acknowledgement that any statute(s) of \n14  limitations governing any of the Plaintiffs' claims against the defendant in any way \n15  arising from the Matters Alleged in the Lawsuit shall be tolled from the date of \ndismissal to the earlier of (a) 30 days after the rescission or (b) the filing of a notice \n16 \nof reinstatement of claims filed with the Court.  No defendant shall be dismissed \n17 \nunder the terms of the preceding sentence until and unless the Court enters a \n18 \npreliminary approval order.  Upon reinstatement of any defendant pursuant the \n19 \nterms of this paragraph, such reinstatement automatically triggers revocation and \n20 \nwithdrawal of all releases and acknowledgements on the part of that defendant \n21 \nmade under the terms of this paragraph. \n22 \nv. \nEFFECT OF SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT FOR DAMAGES \n23 \n32.  This Settlement Agreement is subject to and conditioned on a Fairness \n24 \nHearing conducted by the Court, the Court's final approval of this Settlement \n25 \nAgreement, and entry of the Consent Judgment. The Consent Judgment shall be \n26 \ndeemed final only on expiration of the time to appeal by a class member who has \n27 \nfiled a timely objection to the settlement, or if a Notice of Appeal by any such \n28  person is filed in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, upon exhaustion of all appeals \n18 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 35 of 98\n1  and petitions for writs of certiorari or the expiration of the time to file such writ \n2  petitions. Once final, the Consent Judgment shall be a judgment of this Court, \n3  binding and enforceable in accordance with the terms of this Settlement Agreement \n4  and applicable law. Subject to any continuing rights of Opt-Outs, the Consent \n5  Judgment shall: \n6  A.  Dismiss with prejudice, in the above-captioned MIWON \ncase and all Related Cases, all claims for damages or other relief against any \n7 \nand all Defendants or other Released Persons, each party therein to bear all \n8 \nits own costs and attorney's fees except as otherwise expressly provided for \n9 \nin this Settlement Agreement; \n10 \nB.  Enjoin all Damages Class Members, Structural Relief \n11 \nClass Members and Unrepresented Class Members from asserting against \n12 \nany Defendant or other Released Person any and all claims for damages or \n13 \nother relief which any such class member had, has, or may have in the future \n14 \nin any way arising out of the facts alleged, or in any way related to the claims \n15 \nfor relief pleaded, in the MIWON Complaint or Related Case Complaints, \n16 \nwhich are fully incorporated herein by reference; \n17 \nC.  Release each Defendant and other Released Person from \n18 \nall claims for damages or other relief which any Damages Class Member, \n19 \nStructural Relief Class Member or Unrepresented Class Member had, has, or \n20 \nmay have in the future, against such Defendant or other Released Person in \n21 \nany way arising out of the facts alleged, or in any way related to the claims \n22 \nfor relief pleaded, in the MIWON Complaint or Related Case Complaints; \n23 \nD.  Determine that this Settlement Agreement is entered into \n24 \nin good faith, is reasonable, fair and adequate, and in the best interest of all \n25 \nthe class members; and \n26 \nE.  Reserve the Court's continuing jurisdiction over the \n27 \nparties to this Settlement Agreement, including Defendants, Represented \n28 \nIndividuals and Unrepresented Class Members, to administer, supervise, \n19 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 36 of 98\n1  construe and enforce the Settlement Agreement and/or Consent Judgment in \n2  accordance with their terms for the benefit of all parties. \n3  F.  Reserve the Court's continuing jurisdiction over the \n4  parties to this Settlement Agreement to enforce the terms of the separate \n5  Structural Relief Agreement and Order thereon (\"Structural Relief Order\") \n6  entered by the Court, and fully incorporated herein, regarding resolution of \n7  the injunctive relief class certified by the Court on January 8,2008. \n8  33.  The parties will take all necessary and appropriate steps to obtain \n9  preliminary and final approvals of the Settlement Agreement, dismissal of the \n10  defendants other than the City as provided in Paragraph 31, and dismissal of the \nMIWON and Related Cases with prejudice at the time the Court enters its Consent \n11 \n12  Judgment, all parties bearing all their own attorney's fees and costs unless \n13  otherwise expressly provided in this Settlement Agreement. If the Consent \n14  Judgment is entered and there is an appeal therefrom by an objector, the City will \n15  not oppose Plaintiffs' efforts to defend the Settlement Agreement and/or Consent \n16  Judgment, which shall be at Plaintiffs' sole expense. \n34.  The Consent Judgment that this Settlement Agreement contemplates \n17 \nresolves in full as of the Effective Date all claims for relief, actions, causes of \n18 \naction, or allegations of any kind that in any way arise from or relate to the Matters \n19 \nAlleged in the Lawsuit, against any or all of the Defendants and other Released \n20 \nPersons by any and all of the Represented Individuals and Unrepresented Class \n21 \nMembers, whether based upon any federal, state or local law, law of any foreign \n22 \nnation, regulation, duty, obligation, promise, ordinance or any other legal rule. As \n23 \nof the Effective Date, all the Represented Individuals and Unrepresented Class \n24 \nMembers, except Opt-Outs, waive all rights to any and all claims for relief, actions \n25 \nor causes of action in any way arising from or related to the Matters Alleged in the \n26 \nLawsuit against any and all of the Defendants and other Released Parties, whether \n27 \nbased upon any federal, state or local law, law of any foreign nation, regulation, \n28 \nduty, or obligation, promise, ordinance or any other legal rule. \n20 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 37 of 98\n1  35.  As of the Effective Date, the Represented Individuals and the \n2  Unrepresented Class Members, except Opt-outs, and all their agents, attorneys and \n3  assigns, on the one hand, and the Defendants and all of their agents, attorneys and \n4  assigns, on the other, hereby waive and release one another from any and all claims \n5  or rights to pursue, initiate, prosecute, or commence any action or proceeding \n6  against one another before any court, administrative agency or other tribunal, or to \n7  file against one another any complaint regarding acts or omissions with respect to \n8  any Matters Alleged in the Lawsuit, including but not limited to any claims of \n9  malicious prosecution or abuse of process; and further, as it relates to this mutual \n10  waiver and release, expressly waive the provisions of California Civil Code Section \n11  1542, which provides that \n\"a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not \n12 \nknow or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the \n13 \nrelease, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or \n14 \nher settlement with the debtor.\" \n15 \n36.  Upon Entry of the Consent Judgment, each Represented Individual and \n16 \nUnrepresented Class Member shall be deemed to have consented to the jurisdiction \n17 \nof the Court.  Nothing in this paragraph is intended to negate any prior or other \n18 \nconsent to this Court's jurisdiction by any Represented Individual, Unrepresented \n19 \nClass Member or other person. \n20 \nVI.  HANDLING OF MINORS' CLAIMS \n21 \n37.  Included among the Represented Individuals are minors, some of \n22 \nwhose settlements hereunder are $6000 or less, and some of whose settlements \n23 \nexceed $6000. For those minors who receive, exclusive of attorney's fees and costs, \n24 \nsettlements of $6000 or less, blocked accounts are not to be opened, and the money \n25 \nshall be paid to the parent or other guardian ad litem of the minor for general use \n26 \nfor the minor's health and well-being in whatever manner the parent or guardian \n27 \nsees fit; MIWON plaintiffs within this category, along with their counsel, are listed \n28 \nin Exhibit F. Non-MIWON counsel shall provide their own lists, in a form \n21 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 38 of 98\n1  substantially similar to Exhibit F, to Class Counsel by March 13,2009.  This \n2  paragraph does not impose any duties upon any of the Defendants or other Released \n3  Persons. \n4  38.  For those minors who receive, exclusive of attorney's fees and costs, \n5  settlements over $6000, and who are under the age of 16 as of December 31, 2009, \n6  their counsel shall cause to be opened for them blocked interest bearing bank \n7  accounts on terms further elaborated in the proposed Consent Judgment (attached \n8  as Exhibit C). MIWON plaintiffs within this category, along with their counsel, are \n9  listed in Exhibit G. Non-MIWON counsel shall provide their own lists, in a form \n10  substantially similar to Exhibit G, to Class Counsel by March 13, 2009. Counsel for \n11  any minor encompassed within the first sentence of this paragraph shall file with \n12  the Court a record of each such blocked interest bearing account within 90 days \nfrom the date the City deposits the total settlement amount into the Litt, Estuar, \n13 \n14  Harrison & Kitson Client Trust Account pursuant to Paragraph 25, supra. It shall be \n15  the duty of plaintiffs' counsel to coordinate with Class Counsel to learn the date \nthat such amount is deposited into the Litt, Estuar, Harrison & Kitson Client Trust \n16 \nAccount. This paragraph does not impose any duties upon any of the Defendants or \n17 \nother Released Persons. \n18 \n39.  Settlement funds for those minors who will be 16 years of age or older \n19 \nas of December 31, 2009, and whose individual settlements exceed $6000 exclusive \n20 \nof attorney's fees and costs, shall be maintained in their counsel's Client Trust \n21 \nAccount so that each such settlement can be expeditiously paid to each such minor \n22 \nat the time ofhis/her 18th birthday. MIWON plaintiffs within this category, along \n23 \nwith their counsel, are listed in Exhibit H. Non-MIWON counsel shall provide their \n24 \nown lists, in a form substantially similar to Exhibit H, to Class Counsel by March \n25 \n13,2009. This paragraph does not impose any duties upon any of the Defendants or \n26  other Released Persons. \n27 \n40.  The parties recognize that there may be circumstances in which a \n28  parent or other guardian has a need for the funds in a blocked account for the direct \n22 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 39 of 98\n1  and immediate benefit of a minor plaintiff with an interest in funds in a blocked \n2  account, such as for a medical emergency or braces. The Consent Judgment \n3  contains procedures under which such parents and guardians may withdraw funds \n4  in such cases without the need for court approval. \n5  VII.  HANDLING OF MISSING REPRESENTED INDIVIDUALS' CLAIMS \n6  41.  There are Represented Individuals whose whereabouts are currently \n7  unknown (\"Missing Represented Individuals\"). Plaintiffs' counsel are currently \n8  unable to secure the consent of the Missing Represented Individuals to the \nsettlement. \n9 \n42.  The Court has the authority to approve the amount of settlement for \n10 \nthe Missing Represented Individuals and to bind them under this Settlement \n11 \n12  Agreement and the Consent Judgment. Counsel for the Missing Represented \nIndividuals will send written notice to the last known address of each Missing \n13 \n14  Represented Individual, such notice to set forth the material terms of the settlement, \n15  including all waivers and releases and any sum hereunder payable to such Missing \nRepresented Individual, as those terms relate specifically to him/her. The parties \n16 \nshall request, and hereby do so request, that the Court approve settlements as shall \n17 \nbe designated for the Missing Represented Individuals. Should the Court fail to \n18 \napprove settlement for all the Missing Represented Individuals in the Consent \n19 \nJudgment, the City and other Defendants reserve the right to rescind this Settlement \n20 \nAgreement.  In the event a defendant exercises a right of rescission in accordance \n21 \nwith this paragraph, any funds that the City has paid or otherwise has transferred or \n22 \ndeposited pursuant to this Settlement Agreement shall be returned to it within 10 \n23 \ndays of the rescission, less any expenses, fees and costs incurred by the \n24 \nAdministrator, such costs to include all sums paid to organizations pursuant to \n25 \nParagraph 46, infra; provided, however, that the Administrator shall make a written \n26 \naccounting, to counsel for the City and to Class Counsel, of all such fees and costs. \n27 \nThe Administrator shall forward its written accounting at the same time it returns \n28 \nany funds to the City pursuant to this paragraph. \n23 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 40 of 98\n1  43.  Assuming the Court approval referenced in the preceding paragraph, \n2  each Missing Represented Individual's settlement funds will be placed in a \n3  separate, special interest bearing trust account, where, absent the Missing \n4  Represented Individual's appearance and claim of such funds via such Missing \n5  Represented Individual's counsel in the MIWON or Related Cases, the funds will \n6  remain until December 31, 2012. If any Missing Represented Individual has not \n7  claimed hislher funds by December 31, 2012, then the funds in the account for such \n8  individual shall revert to the City. Counsel for any Missing Represented Individual \n9  who opens a trust account pursuant to this paragraph shall, at the time the trust \n10  account is opened, provide the financial institution holding the funds written notice \n11  of the City's reversionary right and all instructions necessary to facilitate such \n12  reversion on January 1,2013. It shall then be the responsibility of the City to \n13  initiate the reversionary process and contact any holders of the trust accounts \n14  necessary to accomplish it, with which process all Plaintiffs' counsel shall \n15  cooperate. Despite the provisions of this paragraph, between January 1,2013, and \n16  December 31,2018, each Missing Represented Individual shall retain the right to \nreceive from the City (and no other person) the amount of net principal and accrued \n17 \ninterest, if any, that was in the trust account at the time the City received funds from \n18 \nit; provided, however, that said Missing Individual shall not be entitled to receive \n19 \ninterest accrued after December 31,2012, if any. The names of, and counsel for, the \n20 \nMissing Represented Individuals will be provided as an exhibit to the proposed \n21 \nConsent Judgment submitted to the Court before the Fairness Hearing. \n22 \nVIII. TERMS AND EFFECT OF SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT FOR \n23 \nSTRUCTURAL RELIEF \n24 \n44.  This Settlement Agreement contemplates the Court's separate entry of \n25 \nthe Structural Relief Order. A copy of that Order is attached to this Settlement \n26 \nAgreement at Exhibit D and incorporated as though fully set forth herein. The \n27 \nStructural Relief Order provides support for the First Amendment right to assemble \n28 \nin public places to engage in expressive activity and, thereby, provides a substantial \n24 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 41 of 98\n1  benefit to all the Rule 23(b)(2) class members. In addition, the Court has retained \n2  jurisdiction for a period of not less than four (4) years to enter any orders necessary \n3  to enforce the terms of the Structural Relief Order. \n4  IX.  CLASS COUNSEL FEES \n5  45.  The parties agree that the total settlement amount of$12,850,000 \n6  includes all attorney's fees and costs and is the total amount that the City owes \n7  hereunder. Of the $12,600,000 from the total settlement amount, Class Counsel \n8  shall seek an attorney's fee award of no more than $3,713,000, inclusive of all \n9  litigation costs, medical liens and medical costs, for the MIWON-plaintiffs' \n10  counsel. This award encompasses all the attorney's fees and costs for all the \n11  MIWON-plaintiffs' counsel, who carried the great burden of the work on behalf of \n12  all Plaintiffs' counsel in this case. To the limited extent non-MIWON plaintiffs' \ncounsel are entitled to any statutory or other attorney's fees in the Related Cases, \n13 \n14  such fees are encompassed in the amounts designated for them and their clients in \n15  Paragraph 26 (A)-(I), supra. Class Counsel shall provide the Court the amounts \nthey considered in the total amounts paid to non-MIWON plaintiffs' counsel as part \n16 \nof the fee motion. Defendants take no position on the amount of the fees and costs \n17 \nherein sought by Class Counsel. \n18 \nX.  CLASS NOTIFICATION AND CLAIMS ADMINISTRATION \n19 \n46.  In this case, there are not any known mailing lists that contain \n20 \ninformation allowing identification of Unrepresented Class Members. The most \n21 \npractical way to locate Unrepresented Class Members is through dissemination of \n22 \nClass Notices to those in contact with the organizations that organized the May 1 \n23 \nevents in and around MacArthur Park, i.e., MIWON, CHIRLA, IDEPSCA, KlWA, \n24 \nFilipino Workers Center, and Garment Workers Center. Such dissemination may be \n25 \naccomplished by distributing Class Notices and Proof of Claim Forms to members \n26 \nof the organizations and to the general population living in, and using the facilities \n27 \nof, MacArthur Park; by distributing Class Notices at various immigrant-rights \n28 \nrallies, events and meetings, if any, between the Court's preliminary approval and \n25 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 42 of 98\n1  the Claim Cut-Off Date; and by other means of outreach as the Court may order. \n2  Accordingly, the Court authorizes each such organization to be paid up to $4000 \n3  (with the actual amount to be determined by Class Counsel in consultation with the \n4  Administrator) from the Class Fund as a cost of class administration. These \n5  expenditures shall be funded from the Advance Payment or, if necessary, from the \n6  Class Fund. In exchange, each such organization must devote 100 hours to \n7  distribution of Class Notices in areas in which the organization believes it most \n8  likely that Unrepresented Class Members may be present. Each such organization \n9  shall complete its dissemination of Class Notices and Proof of Claim Forms no later \n10  than May 6,2009, and shall further provide the Administrator written attestation of \ncompliance with the provisions of this paragraph, including compliance with the \n11 \n100-hour distribution requirement herein, no later than the Claim Cut-Off Date. The \n12 \n13  Administrator shall file all such attestations with the Court no later than June 3, \n14  2009. \n47.  All Class Notices shall include a Proof of Claim Form to be used in \n15 \nconnection with any claims made against the Class Fund. (See Exhibit B.) The \n16 \nProof of Claim Form shall require a statement, made under penalty of perjury, that \n17 \nthe individual (1) was present on May 1, 2007, in the geographic area bounded by \n18 \n6th Street (on the north), Alvarado Street (on the east), 7th Street (on the south), \n19 \nand Park View Street (on the west), or the immediately adjacent areas, including \n20 \nfrom 6th Street west to Lafayette Park, at some point between the hours of 5 :00 \n21 \np.m. and 7:00 p.m., (2) did not engage in any conduct justifying Defendants' \n22 \ndispersal order or the use of force, and (3) was subjected to the LAPD's use of \n23 \nforce, dispersal order or other unlawful police activity arising from the police \n24 \nresponse to the immigration march and rally. The Proof of Claim Form shall require \n25 \nan additional statement in the claimant's own words setting forth specific facts \n26 \nsupporting his/her claim against the Class Fund. \n27 \n48.  The Administrator shall be responsible for publishing a summary Class \n28 \nNotice in La Opinion, once a week for at least three consecutive weeks beginning \n26 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 43 of 98\n1  no later than the week of March 30, 2009. The parties agree that La Opinion is the \n2  publication most likely to reach Unrepresented Class Members. \n3  49.  Except for publication of summary Class Notice in La Opinion, \n4  preparation of approximately 10,000 Class Notices for distribution, and provision \n5  of Class Notices to those who request them from the Administrator, the \n6  Administrator's only responsibilities shall be (a) to process and pay class claims, \n7  (b) to process Unrepresented Class Members' objections and requests for exclusion, \n8  (c) to file attestations as provided in paragraph 46, supra, (d) to use the database(s) \n9  normally used by the Administrator to verify the social security number or TIN a \n10  claimant has provided on the Proof of Claim Form (\"SS Database\") (see Paragraph \n52, infra); (e) to select the Investigator referenced in Paragraph 54, infra, and cause \n11 \n12  investigations to be undertaken upon request from the City; (f) to provide \ndocuments required by court orders to finalize the class settlement, (g) to provide \n13 \n14  the accountings, reports and notices to parties and/or counsel, including the total \n15  number of Opt-Outs under Paragraph 63, infra, pursuant to the terms of this \nSettlement Agreement, (h) to provide and maintain the lists of rejected claims \n16 \npursuant to Paragraph 57, infra, (i) to return to the City any unused portion of the \n17 \nPost Administration Class Fund or Advance Payment, (j) to return to the City any \n18 \nfunds due the City upon rescission of the Settlement Agreement, and (k) to perform \n19 \nany other tasks specified for it in this Settlement Agreement. \n20 \n50.  A Proof of Claim Form shall be deemed timely submitted when \n21 \nreceived by the Administrator, or postmarked for delivery to the Administrator, on \n22 \nor before the Claim Cut-Off Date. \n23 \n51.  An Unrepresented Class Member's objection to or request for \n24 \nexclusion from the settlement shall be deemed timely submitted if received by the \n25 \nAdministrator, or postmarked for delivery to the Administrator, on or before the \n26  Bar Date. \n27 \n52.  Prior to payment of any Unrepresented Class Member's claim against \n28 \nthe Class Fund, the Administrator shall ensure that every claimant has provided all \n27 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 44 of 98\n1  the information required by the terms of the Proof of Claim Form.  The \n2  Administrator shall also take such other steps as it deems reasonably necessary to \n3  satisfy itself that claimants were present at MacArthur Park between the hours of \n4  5:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. on May 1, and that there is a factual basis for the claims. \n5  These steps may include (a) checking a social security number or TIN appearing on \n6  a Proof of Claim Form, (b) comparing the name of any claimant to the name listed \n7  in the SS Database, (c) checking with witnesses listed in the Proof of Claim Form, \n8  (d) communicating with the claimant, and (e) otherwise following up on claims. \n9  The Administrator shall preliminarily reject any claim upon discovery of any claim \n10  in which a social security number or TIN has been used on more than one Proof of \nClaim Form.  The Administrator shall similarly preliminarily reject any claim in \n11 \n12  which the claimant has not provided all the information required by the terms of the \n13  Proof of Claim Form. If the Administrator rejects a claim under the terms of the \n14  preceding sentences in this paragraph, such rejection shall not be final.  Instead, the \n15  Administrator shall provide the claimant a deficiency notice by First Class Mail, \nand such written notice shall (1) identify the deficiency or deficiencies in the claim \n16 \nand (2) designate a 30-day time limit to provide an opportunity for the claimant to \n17 \ncure all deficiencies. The Administrator shall prepare form deficiency notices and \n18 \nprovide them to the parties, who shall have the opportunity to make suggestions \n19 \nregarding the final forms. In determining whether to finally accept or reject a claim, \n20 \nit shall be the responsibility of the Administrator to assess the accuracy and \n21 \nreliability of the claim, including the claimant's response to any deficiency notice. \n22 \nIf, upon the expiration of the 30-day period after mailing a deficiency notice, no \n23 \nwritten explanation is received by, or postmarked for delivery to, the Administrator, \n24 \nthe Administrator shall finally reject that claim.  The Administrator may finally \n25 \nreject a claim that remains deficient notwithstanding the claimant's response to a \n26 \ndeficiency notice. \n27 \n53.  Immediately upon entry of the Consent Judgment, the Administrator \n28 \nshall provide to Class Counsel and counsel for the City, via U.S. Mail, redacted \n28 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 45 of 98\n1  copies of all Proof of Claim Forms that the Administrator determines warrant \n2  payment from the Class Fund. The Administrator shall redact such copies to omit \n3  all information on each Proof of Claim Form except the specific facts set forth by \n4  the claimant to support the claim and the unique Proof of Claim Form number, \n5  which the Administrator shall assign to each Proof of Claim Form. Only the \n6  Administrator and any Investigator it selects pursuant to Paragraph 54 shall be \n7  privy to the other information contained in the Proof of Claim Forms, subject to the \n8  terms of Paragraph 64, infra. In providing counsel with the redacted copies herein, \n9  the Administrator shall identify, by cover letter or other means, all Proof of Claim \n10  Forms that the Administrator does not intend to pay, or intends to send deficiency \nnotices on, for whatever reason. If a Proof of Claim Form has not been so \n11 \ndesignated, that means the Administrator intends to pay the claim without further \n12 \n13  mqUIry. \n14  54.  Upon receipt of the redacted copies of Proof of Claim Forms \n15  referenced in the preceding paragraph, the City shall be entitled to designate Proof \nof Claim Forms on which it wishes to cause an investigation to be conducted by a \n16 \nprivate, neutral investigator (\"Investigator\") of the Administrator's choosing, into \n17 \ntruthfulness and merits of any claim raised. In addition, the City may designate \n18 \ncategories of claims to be investigated, e.g., claims where more than a certain \n19 \nnumber of individuals use the same address or claims where the same witness is \n20 \nlisted for unrelated claimants. The Administrator shall cause investigations in such \n21 \ncases to be undertaken by the Investigator. The Investigator shall conduct \n22 \ninvestigations with all due speed. The Investigator shall provide the written results \n23 \nof his/her investigation, including a written conclusion whether the Investigator is \n24 \nreasonably satisfied that the claim is meritorious, to the Administrator. If the \n25 \nAdministrator concludes that the claim lacks merit, then the Administrator shall \n26 \nsend the claimant a deficiency notice and afford the claimant 30 days from the date \n27 \nthe deficiency notice is mailed to provide a written explanation, under penalty of \n28 \nperjury, for the deficiency. If, upon the expiration of the 30-day period, no written \n29 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 46 of 98\n1  explanation is received by, or postmarked for delivery to, the Administrator, the \n2  Administrator shall reject the claim. If the Claimant timely responds to the \n3  deficiency notice, the Administrator and the Investigator shall confer.  If the \n4  Administrator determines that the weight of the evidence in the Proof of Claim \n5  Form and response to the deficiency notice indicates that the claim lacks merit, the \n6  claim will be rejected.  If the Administrator concludes that the weight of the \n7  evidence indicates that the claim is meritorious, the claim will be honored and paid. \n8  Nothing in this paragraph or any other paragraph in this Settlement Agreement shall \n9  require the Administrator or Investigator to inquire into any claimant's citizenship \n10  or immigration status. \n11  55.  Class Counsel shall receive copies of all requests regarding possible \n12  investigations of claims and may submit their views regarding the propriety of any \ninvestigation sought, and their reasons therefore. Such views expressed by Class \n13 \n14  Counsel shall not affect the Administrator's duty to cause an investigation to be \n15  undertaken upon request by the City. \n56.  The costs of all investigations under Paragraph 54, but not activities \n16 \nlisted in Paragraph 52, shall be at the City'S sole expense, to be paid by the City \n17 \nbased upon bills sent by the Administrator. Accordingly, no portion of the Class \n18 \nFund, as defined herein, shall be used to pay for any investigation or verification of \n19 \nclass claims under Paragraph 54. \n20 \n57.  The Administrator will prepare a list of all rejected claims, with the \n21 \nreasons for rej ection, and maintain the list until at least December 31, 2014. \n22 \n58.  The Parties agree that untimely filed Proof of Claim Forms shall be \n23 \nfinally rejected by the Administrator and no payments thereon shall be made. \n24 \nXI.  EXCLUSION FROM SETTLEMENT CLASS: OPT-OUTS \n25 \n59.  Any Unrepresented Class Member who wishes to be excluded from \n26 \nthe terms of this Settlement Agreement must submit a request for exclusion by the \n27 \nBar Date.

PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT \n1.  This is a class action brought in connection with events at and \n11 \nsurrounding a protest at MacArthur Park on May 1, 2007 (\"May 1\" ). Plaintiffs \n12 \nallege that the Los Angeles Police Department (\"LAPD\"), an agency of the City, \n13 \n14  violated their First and Fourth Amendment rights by, among other things, \ndeclaring an unlawful assembly and engaging in excessive force. The Court, with \n15 \nthe approval of all Plaintiffs' counsel, ordered the captioned MIWON class action \n16 \ninto mediation, along with the following Related Cases, all of which involved \n17 \nsimilar allegations: \n18  \u0001r-----------------------~----------~------------------~I \nRELATED CASES  NUMBER  ATTORNEY \n19  Santiago v.  City ofL os Angeles  2:07 CV -02966  Gregory Yates \n20  Brandon Aguilar v.  City ofL os  2:07 CV-04131  Luis Carrillo \nAngeles \n21  Newton v.

The MIWON \n28  counsel represented both the certified  3 class and individual class members in \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 4 of 98\n1  the MIWON case, who alleged they had been injured as a result of the actions of \n2  the LAPD on May 1. Other counsel represent additional individuals in the Related \n3  Cases who also alleged they had been injured as a result of the actions of the \n4  LAPD on May 1. The 297 total individuals represented by the MIWON counsel \nand other counsel in the Related Cases are hereafter referred to collectively as the \n5 \n\"Represented Individuals\" whether they are named in any complaint or not. Their \n6 \nnames and counsel are listed in Exhibit E to the Settlement Agreement. The \n7 \nsettlement negotiations were conducted in such a manner as to compensate the \n8 \nRepresented Individuals, inclusive of attorney's fees and costs, and to compensate \n9 \na residual class composed of class members who do not opt out and who file \n10 \nclaims against a residual Class Fund. \n11 \n3.  This Order incorporates by reference the definitions in the Settlement \n12 \nAgreement (Exhibit A), and also incorporates Exhibits B through H, thereto. All \n13 \nterms defined therein shall have the same meaning in this Order.  This Order is not \n14 \nintended to modify any of the terms of provisions of the Settlement Agreement. \n15 \n4.  The Settlement Agreement provides for a total of$12,600,000 to be \n16 \npaid to the 297 represented individuals and a residual Class Fund of $250,000 \n17 \n(inclusive of costs of class administration). The plaintiffs' counsel who are \n18 \nsignatories to the Settlement Agreement (Exhibit A) have warranted that, with the \n19 \nexception of the Missing Represented Individuals and Antonio Lopez, (1) they \n20 \nhave authority from each Represented Individual whom they represent to settle the \n21 \ncases on the terms set forth herein, (2) each of their clients is aware of and has \n22 \nauthorized the amount each will receive from the settlement, and (3) each of their \n23 \nclients is aware of and has approved the attorney's fee arrangement between \n24 \ncounsel and client. \n25 \n5.  The parties' Settlement Agreement contemplates that there may be \n26 \nsome structured settlements for individual plaintiffs. (A structured settlement \n27 \nrefers to an agreement under which a third party is paid by the Defendants to \n28 \n4 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 5 of 98\n1  provide agreed upon periodic payments over a defined period of time, rather than a \n2  single lump sum payment.) To the extent there are such agreements, funds will not \n3  be deposited into any individual accounts but will be directed as required under \n4  the terms of the structured settlement agreement. Thus, this Preliminary Approval \n5  Order preliminarily approves only the total amount that the City will be \n6  responsible to pay plaintiffs collectively, either directly or in the form of a \nstructured settlement. To the extent there are structured settlements, they will be \n7 \nnegotiated by counsel for that plaintiff individually, memorialized in individual \n8 \nsettlement agreements, and provided to the court as part of the Consent Judgment. \n9 \nIt will be the Consent Judgment, should there be one, consistent with the terms of \n10 \nthe Settlement Agreement, that will constitute the binding settlement terms among \n11 \nthe parties. \n12 \n6.  Class Counsel have represented to the Court that they believe that \n13 \nmost of those filing Class Fund claims (as distinct from Represented Individuals) \n14 \nwill not have suffered physical injury, and the value of those claims is \n15 \nconsiderably lower than the value of the claims of those who suffered physical \n16 \nInJury. \n17 \n7.  Class Counsel have also represented to the Court that they believe that \n18 \na minority of class members (but most Represented Individuals) received physical \n19 \ninjuries while most class members (but few Represented Individuals) received no \n20 \nphysical injury. Class Counsel consider a hybrid settlement appropriate as a class \n21 \nsettlement because (1) they have been able to assess the damages for the \n22 \nRepresented Individuals, the majority of whom received physical and/or \n23 \nsignificant psychological injury, (2) they consider it likely that most of those who \n24 \nreceived physical injuries are among the Represented Individuals, and (3) those \n25 \nfew class members who have serious injuries and are not among the Represented \n26 \nIndividuals will be able to opt out of the settlement and pursue individual \n27 \nremedies. \n28 \n5 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 6 of 98\n1  8.  The Court is also advised that, pursuant to contract terms between \n2  attorney and client, some of the non-MIWON attorneys - but not the MIWON \n3  counsel- may receive a percentage of the client's recovery, as negotiated between \n4  attorney and client. Since these agreements are in the non-MIWON cases, they are \n5  not subject to court approval. (See Exhibit E for the clients and for their counsel; \n6  the non-MIWON clients are those listed as represented by the following non \nMIWON  counsel: Carl Douglas; Ellen Ellison; Leo Hernandez; Louis Krass; Luis \n7 \nCarrillo; Susan Pintar; James Segall-Gutierrez; and Gregory Yates.) \n8 \n9.  The Court is also advised that the settlement provides that minors' \n9 \nclaims at or below $6000 will be designated for general use for the minor's health \n10 \nand well-being in whatever manner the parent or guardian sees fit, with certain \n11 \nother conditions set forth in the Settlement Agreement and proposed Consent \n12 \nJudgment. For minors receiving above $6000, they will be either placed in a \n13 \nblocked account or, for those who are 16 or above this year, they will be placed in \n14 \ncounsel's trust account until they tum 18. There are also provisions for \n15 \nwithdrawals for the minor's benefit from any blocked account. \n16 \n10.  The Court is further advised that the settlement provides that the \n17 \nawards for Missing Represented Individuals should be approved by the Court \n18 \nunless such individuals have opted out. Prior to the Final Approval Hearing, the \n19 \nCourt will be provided with a list of the Represented Individuals who are then \n20 \nmissing, and with declarations from their respective counsel regarding the efforts \n21 \nmade to locate those individuals. \n22 \n11.  The Court is further advised that there is a draft of a Structural Relief \n23 \nOrder, attached as Exhibit D, to resolve the injunctive relief claims in this case, \n24 \nwhich the Court will also be asked to approve at the Fairness Hearing. \n25 \n12.  The Court is advised that the settlement includes a component for \n26 \nattorney's fees amounting to less than the hours recorded and spent on the case \n27 \nmultiplied by Plaintiffs' counsel's hourly rates, to be taken from the $12,600,000 \n28 \n6 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 7 of 98\n1  Represented Individuals' Fund. This fee, not to exceed $3,713,000 (inclusive of \n2  litigation costs and medical costs and medical liens ), will be presented to the Court \n3  in the form of a motion for approval of attorney's fees (\"Fee Motion\"), to be \n4  considered and ruled on by the Court at the same time as the Fairness Hearing. \n5  13.  The Court is aware that this matter was mediated by Magistrate Judge \n6  Carla Woehrle, and that this settlement was reached at arm's length. \n14.  The Settlement Agreement is hereby preliminarily approved, subject \n7 \nto further consideration thereof at the Fairness Hearing provided for below. The \n8 \nCourt finds that the Settlement Agreement is within the range of what would \n9 \nconstitute a fair, reasonable, and adequate settlement in the best interests of the \n10 \nclass as a whole. The Court also preliminarily finds that it is reasonable to \n11 \ndistinguish between the Represented Individuals, whose damages could be \n12 \nindividually assessed, and most of whom suffered physical injury, from the \n13 \nresidual class, on the assumption that most residual class members did not suffer \n14 \nsignificant physical or psychological injury, and that those who did would have \n15 \nthe choice to opt out of the settlement. \n16 \n15.  This preliminary approval includes preliminary approval of the \n17 \nhandling of minors' claims and Missing Represented Individuals' claims, as set \n18 \nforth in the Settlement Agreement. \n19 \n16.  The Court approves the process for notifying possible class members \n20 \nof the settlement, and the claims process, as set forth in the Settlement Agreement. \n21 \n17.  The Court approves the publication of summary Class Notice, as set \n22 \nforth in the Settlement Agreement. \n23 \n18.  The Court has previously certified classes under Federal Rules of \n24  Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3). The Court hereby reaffirms the class \n25  definitions as set forth in its order of January 8, 2008. \n26  II.  DEADLINES FOR NOTICE, FILING OBJECTIONS AND OPT-\n27  OUTS, AND DATE OF FAIRNESS HEARING \n28 \n7 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 8 of 98\n1  19.

However, the Court must approve \n24 \nany change of the date of the Fairness Hearing. \n25 \n21.  Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, if the total number \n26 \nof Opt-Outs exceeds 25 persons, the City, in its sole discretion, may rescind the \n27 \nSettlement Agreement.

The City, in exercising a right of rescission under \n3  the terms of this paragraph, shall provide the Administrator and Class Counsel \n4  with written notice of rescission (1) within 20 days after receipt of the \n5  Administrator's report providing the total number of Opt-Outs, and/or (2) within \n6  20 days after the Bar Date or date of any Represented Individual's exclusion from \n7  the settlement, whichever is later.  In the event the City exercises a right of \n8  rescission under the terms of this paragraph, any funds paid or deposited pursuant \n9  to this Settlement Agreement shall be returned to the City within 10 days of the \n10  exercise of the right to rescind, less any expenses, fees and costs incurred by the \n11  Administrator, and the case shall return to active litigation status. \n12  III.  CLASS REPRESENTATIVES \n13  22.  The Class Representatives are: Kevin Breslin, David Gabriel Eng, \nLuis Galvez, Gerardo Gomez, Jaime Maldonado, Leopoldo Ortiz, Romualdo \n14 \nPedro, and Jeremy Rothe-Kushel (per the Court's January 8, 2008, class \n15 \ncertification order). \n16 \nIV.  CLAIMS ADMINISTRATOR \n17 \n23.  The Court approves Class Counsel's retention of Gilardi & Co. LLC \n18 \nas Administrator to administer the distribution of the Class Notice and publication \n19 \nof summary Class Notice, and to distribute the proceeds of the settlement to all \n20 \neligible class members pursuant to the terms set forth in the Settlement Agreement \n21 \n(Exhibit A) and the Consent Judgment (Exhibit C) should the Court grant final \n22 \napproval.

The Administrator's responsibilities shall include publishing notice, \n26 \nprocessing claims and otherwise engaging in the activities needed to administer \n27 \nthe class claims. The specific duties of the Administrator between this Preliminary \n28 \n9 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 10 of 98\n1  Approval Order and the Consent Judgment are set forth in Paragraphs 46-58 of the \n2  Settlement Agreement, the provisions of which are incorporated herein and \n3  approved. \n4  25.  The Administrator shall be compensated for its services out of the \n5  $250,000 set aside for the residual Class Fund. The City shall advance $50,000 for \n6  class notice, processing, and administration. \n7  V.  CLASS COUNSEL \n8  26.  Barrett S. Litt, Carol A. Sobel and Paul L. Hoffman are hereby re-\nconfirmed as counsel for the Class Representatives and the Class (\"Class \n9 \nCounsel\"). \n10 \n27.  Class Counsel are authorized to act on behalf of the class with respect \n11 \nto all acts or consents required by, or which may be given pursuant to, the \n12 \nSettlement Agreement, and such other acts reasonably necessary to consummate \n13 \nthe Settlement Agreement. \n14 \n28.  At the Fairness Hearing, Class Counsel shall make an application for \n15 \napproval of Class Attorneys' Fees not to exceed $3,713,000, including litigation \n16 \ncosts and medical costs and medical liens, to be paid from Represented \n17 \nIndividuals' Fund of$12,600,000. \n18 \nVI.  CLASS AND SETTLEMENT NOTICE \n19 \n29.  In these cases, there are not any mailing lists that contain information \n20 \nallowing identification of potential class members. The most practical way to \n21 \nlocate potential class members is through dissemination of Class Notices to those \n22 \nin contact with the organizations who organized the May 1 protest.  Accordingly, \n23 \nthe Court approves payment of up to $4000 as a cost of class administration from \n24 \nthe Class Fund to each Plaintiff Organization. These expenditures shall be \n25 \nconsidered a class administration cost. In exchange, each such organization must \n26 \ndistribute Class Notices in areas in which it believes it most likely that class \n27 \nmembers may be present. Each such organization shall provide an attestation of \n28 \n10 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 11 of 98\n1  compliance with these provisions, including the time spent, prior to the Fairness \n2  Hearing. \n3  30.  The Class Notice shall include a Proof of Claim Form to be used in \n4  connection with any claims made against the Class Fund. It shall require a \n5  statement, made under penalty of perjury, that the individual claimant (1) was \n6  present on May 1, 2007 in the geographic area bounded by 6th Street (on the \nnorth), Alvarado Street (on the east), 7th Street (on the south), and Park View \n7 \nStreet (on the west), or the immediately adjacent areas, including from 6th Street \n8 \nwest to Lafayette Park, at any point between the hours of 5:00 and 7:00 p.m., (2) \n9 \ndid not engage in any conduct justifying Defendants' dispersal order or the use of \n10 \nforce, (3) and was subjected to the LAPD's use of force, dispersal order or other \n11 \nunlawful police activity arising from the police response to the immigration march \n12 \nand rally.  The Proof of Claim Form shall require an additional statement in the \n13 \nclaimant's own words setting forth specific facts supporting his/her claim against \n14 \nthe Class Fund. \n15 \n31.  The Court approves the substance of the draft Class Notice attached as \n16 \nExhibit B. \n17 \n32.  The Court approves the substance of the draft Proof of Claim Form \n18 \nattached as the last page of Exhibit B. \n19 \n33.  The Administrator shall be responsible for publishing a summary \n20 \nClass Notice once a week for three consecutive weeks in La Opinion, which the \n21 \nparties agree is the publication most likely to reach class members. \n22 \n34.  The Court finds that the notice required by the foregoing provisions of \n23 \nthis Order is the best notice practicable under the circumstances and shall \n24 \nconstitute due and sufficient notice of the settlement and the Fairness Hearing to \n25 \nall class members and other persons affected by, or entitled to participate in, the \n26 \nsettlement, and is in full compliance with the notice requirements of Rule 23 of the \n27 \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure and due process of law. \n28 \n11 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 12 of 98\n1  35.  Except for publication in La Opinion, preparation of 10,000 class \n2  notices, and providing class notices to those who request them from the \n3  Administrator, the Administrator's responsibility shall be to process and pay class \n4  claims, to provide documents required by court orders to finalize the class \n5  settlement, and to engage in other activities assigned to the Administrator in the \n6  Settlement Agreement attached as Exhibit A. \n7  36.  A Proof of Claim Form shall be deemed timely submitted when \n8  received by the Administrator, or postmarked, on or before the Claim Date. \n9  37.  An Unrepresented Class Member's objection or request for exclusion \n10  shall be deemed timely submitted when received by the Administrator, or \n11  postmarked, on or before the Bar Date. \n12  VII.  THE FAIRNESS HEARING \n13  38.  A Fairness Hearing shall be held on June 22,2009, to consider: (a) the \nfairness, reasonableness, and adequacy of the settlement; (b) whether the Consent \n14 \nJudgment, a draft of which is attached as Exhibit C, should be entered in its \n15 \ncurrent or some modified form; and (c) the application by Class Counsel for \n16 \napproval of the settlement of attorneys' fees and expenses. \n17 \n39.  The date and time of the Fairness Hearing shall be subject to \n18 \nadjournment by the Court without further notice to the class members other than \n19 \nthat which may be posted at the Court and on the Court's web site. \n20 \n40.  Any class member who objects to the approval of the Settlement \n21 \nAgreement, the Represented Individuals' award, the Class Fund award or the Fee \n22 \nMotion, and has filed a timely objection (i.e., by April 27, 2009), may appear at \n23 \nthe Fairness Hearing and show cause why the Settlement Agreement, the \n24 \nRepresented Individuals' award, the Class Fund award or the Fee Motion should \n25 \nnot be approved as fair, reasonable, and adequate, and why the Consent Judgment \n26 \nshould not be entered; except that no such class member may appear at the \n27  Fairness Hearing unless the class member, no later than May 15,2009, (a) files \n28 \n12 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 13 of 98\n1  with the Clerk of the Court a notice of such person's intention to appear, a \n2  statement that indicates the basis and grounds for such person's objection to the \n3  Settlement Agreement, the Represented Individuals' award, the Class Fund award \n4  or the Fee Motion, and all documentation, papers, or briefs in support of such \n5  objection; and by the same date (b) serves upon all Counsel to the Parties (as listed \nin the Notice of Proposed Settlement), either in person or by mail, copies of such \n6 \nnotice of intention to appear, statement of objections and all documentation, \n7 \npapers, or briefs that such person files with the Court. The required documentation \n8 \nshall include information demonstrating that the objector is a class member, \n9 \nincluding name, address, date of birth, and a description of the class member's \n10 \nexperiences on May 1, entitling him or her to qualify as a class member (including \n11 \nnames of witnesses and all relevant documentation). Final determination whether \n12 \nany such objector is a class member who has standing to object shall be made by \n13 \nthe Court if any party contests the issue. In the absence of the timely filing and \n14 \ntimely service of the notice of intention to appear and all other materials required \n15 \nby this paragraph, any objection shall be deemed untimely and denied. \n16 \n41.  Pending final approval of the Settlement Agreement, no class member \n17 \nshall, either directly, representatively, or in any other capacity, commence, \n18 \nprosecute against any Defendant or participate in any action or proceeding in any \n19 \ncourt or tribunal asserting any of the matters, claims, or causes of action that are to \n20 \nbe released by the Settlement Agreement upon final approval. \n21 \n42.  In the event of final approval of the Settlement Agreement, all class \n22 \nmembers (except those who have requested exclusion and been excluded) shall be \n23 \nforever enjoined and barred from asserting any of the matters, claims or causes of \n24 \naction released by the Settlement Agreement, and all such class members shall be \n25 \ndeemed to have forever released any and all such matters, claims and causes of \n26 \naction as provided for in the Settlement Agreement. \n27  VIII.

RECITALS \nThe Class Representative Plaintiffs filed the above-captioned action in the \n16 \nUnited States District Court for the Central District of California (\"Court\") on May \n17 \n9,2007. The several Related Cases were filed in the Central District as well. \n18 \nThe Class Representative Plaintiffs asserted they represented a class of \n19 \npersons who were subjected to violation of their First and Fourth Amendment \n20 \nrights, as well as other federal constitutional rights and rights under California state \n21 \nlaw, as a result of actions by the Los Angeles Police Department (\"LAPD\"), an \n22 \nagency of the City, surrounding a protest at MacArthur Park on May I, 2007 (\"May \n23 \nI \"). The Class Representative Plaintiffs alleged that the LAPD and its personnel, \n24 \npursuant to policy, violated their rights by, among other things, declaring an \n25 \nunlawful assembly and engaging in excessive force. \n26 \nOver the objections and opposition of the City and other defendants named in \n27 \nthe above-captioned case brought by plaintiff Multi-Ethnic Immigrant Workers \n28 \nOrganizing Network (\"MIWON\"), the Court certified a damages class and an \n3 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 20 of 98\n1  injunctive class on January 8,2008. Subsequently, the parties engaged in extensive \n2  settlement negotiations over six sessions with United States District Court \n3  Magistrate Judge Carla Woehrle (\"Judge Woehrle\"). This settlement, which the \n4  parties have reached through arms-length negotiations with the assistance of Judge \n5  Woehrle, is the result of those negotiations. \n6  The Defendants, the plaintiffs in the MIWON case, and the plaintiffs in the \n7  Related Cases, now agree that they wish to avoid the cost, time and risks involved \n8  in further litigation of these cases and to bring an end to the litigation. \n9  Therefore, the parties agree as follows: \n10  II.  DEFINITIONS \n11  1.  \"Administrator\" means the claims administrator chosen by the \n12  Plaintiffs and to be appointed by the Court to administer the claims process, pay \nclass claims, cause (if needed) English-language documents disseminated to class \n13 \n14  members to be translated into Spanish prior to dissemination, issue deficiency \nnotices, publish summary Class Notice, discharge other duties set forth in this \n15 \nSettlement Agreement and handle other tasks necessary and appropriate to \n16 \ncompleting the claims process. \n17 \n2.

Nothing in this paragraph in any way either increases \n14  the total settlement amount owed by the City or imposes any payment obligation on \n15  any other Defendant or Released Person. \n18.  The \"Claim Cut-off Date\" of May 27,2009, is the date by which any \n16 \nUnrepresented Class Member who wishes to receive payment from the Post \n17 \nAdministration Class Fund must file hislher Proof of Claim Form (attached as the \n18 \nlast page of Exhibit B). \n19 \n19.  The \"Bar Date,\" which is April 27, 2009, is the date by which any \n20 \nclass member must file objections, if any, to this Settlement Agreement, or any \n21 \nclass member must request exclusion from the settlement.  An Unrepresented Class \n22 \nMember requests exclusion from the settlement by sending a request to the \n23 \nAdministrator consistent with the terms of Paragraph 59, infra.  A Represented \n24 \nIndividual requests exclusion from the settlement either by failing to provide \n25 \nhislher counsel with a signed authorization or by providing written notice to the \n26 \nCourt and parties of hislher intent to exclude him or herself, in either case no later \n27 \nMIWON counsel intend to advise the Court of the amounts they calculated for the \n1 \n28  non-MIWON  counsel  based  on  the  information  made  available  to  MIWON \n9 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 26 of 98\n1  than the Bar Date. \n2  III.  DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY; NO ADMISSION OR WAIVER \n3  20.  This Settlement Agreement is for settlement purposes only. Nothing in \n4  the Settlement Agreement, its exhibits or other documents incorporated herein shall \n5  be construed as, or deemed to be evidence of, a waiver of any defense or legal \n6  position otherwise available to any of the Defendants or any other persons. Neither \n7  the fact of settlement nor any provision contained in this Settlement Agreement, its \n8  exhibits or other documents incorporated herein, nor any party's or other person's \n9  performance hereunder shall constitute or be admissible anywhere as (a) evidence \n10  establishing or otherwise relating to any claim for relief or any fact alleged by any \nRepresented Individual, Unrepresented Class Member or other person, whether in \n11 \n12  this action or in any other pending or future action or proceeding; or (b) evidence of \n13  any wrongdoing, fault, violation oflaw, or liability of any kind on the part of any \n14  Defendant or other Released Person. The Defendants make no admission of any \n15  claim, allegation or fact in the MIWON case, the Related Cases or any other action \n16  or proceeding whatsoever.  Rather they deny all allegations of wrongdoing and \ndeny any liability whatever to the Represented Individuals, to any Unrepresented \n17 \nClass Member or to any other person. This Settlement Agreement does not create, \n18 \nand is not intended to create, any rights belonging to any non-parties, except as \n19 \notherwise expressly provided herein. \n20 \nIV.  TERMS OF SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT FOR DAMAGES \n21 \n21.  The parties enter into this Settlement Agreement solely for the \n22 \npurposes of this settlement and its implementation. If the Settlement Agreement \n23 \ndoes not receive final court approval as provided herein, then this Settlement \n24 \nAgreement shall have no effect whatever, and the parties shall in all respects return \n25 \nto their positions ex ante; provided, however, that said return to the parties' \n26 \npositions ex ante shall not entitle any party to reimbursement of costs already \n27 \nincurred under this Settlement Agreement, except as otherwise expressly provided \n28 \ncounsel.. \n10 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 27 of 98\n1  herein. \n2  22.  The total monetary settlement in the MIWON and Related Cases \n3  collectively, including all payments to Represented Individuals and Unrepresented \n4  Class Members, and all payments for class administration (except for special \n5  payments for activities requested by the City as provided in Paragraph 54), is \n6  $12,850,000. Payment of said amount shall be the obligation of the City and no \n7  other Defendant or person. The City intends to use the proceeds from one or more \n8  Judgment Obligation Bonds (hereafter the \"Judgment Bond\") to fund the Consent \n9  Judgment resulting from this settlement. The City will deposit the funds required \n10  under this Settlement Agreement forthwith after it receives the proceeds of the sale \n11  of the Judgment Bond, the purpose of such sale being to fund the instant settlement. \n12  The parties will use their best efforts to facilitate receipt of such funds within 120 \ndays of the Effective Date. If, after six months from the Effective Date, the \n13 \n14  Judgment Bond has not been sold, the City will provide a report to the Court and \n15  Class Counsel regarding how it plans to fund the settlement. The failure or inability \nof the City to sell the Judgment Bond shall not be cause for the City to rescind the \n16 \nSettlement Agreement. The Consent Judgment shall in any event be considered a \n17 \nfinal non-appealable judgment, collectible under the same legal standard as any \n18 \nfinal judgment in federal court that has not been appealed, except as otherwise \n19 \nprovided in this Settlement Agreement. Other provisions of this paragraph \n20 \nnotwithstanding, the City shall advance to the Litt, Estuar, Harrison & Kitson \n21 \nClient Trust Account\" $50,000 of the $250,000 constituting the Class Fund (the \n22 \n\"Advance Payment\") for: dissemination of Class Notices and publication of \n23 \nsummary Class Notices; processing of class claims; and other reasonably necessary \n24 \nclass-administration activities after the Court issues its preliminary approval, \n25 \nincluding other class administration activities set forth in the Settlement \n26 \nAgreement. In the event no Consent Judgment becomes final, or if the Settlement \n27 \nAgreement is rescinded, any portion of the Advance Payment that the \n28 \nAdministrator has used, including sums paid to organizations pursuant to Paragraph \n11 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 28 of 98\n1  46, infra, shall not be refundable; portions of the Advance Payment that the \n2  Administrator has not used shall be refundable.  Should the total amount required \n3  by the Administrator exceed $50,000, such additional funds shall be drawn from the \n4  $200,000 otherwise designated for payment of claims to Unrepresented Class \n5  Members. \n6  23.  The Represented Individuals' Fund amount of$12,600,000 shall be \n7  applied to settle all the claims of all the Represented Individuals, including all \n8  attorney's fees, all liens and costs.  Counsel for the MIWON Represented \n9  Individuals and counsel for the other Represented Individuals have agreed among \n10  themselves on the amounts that each of the Represented Individuals will receive. \nEach Represented Individual, except Missing Represented Individuals, who are \n11 \n12  addressed elsewhere in this Settlement Agreement, either has agreed or is expected \n13  to agree, to settle hereunder in exchange for the amount designated for him/her by \n14  counsel. (See Paragraph 28 for the City's right to rescind this Settlement \n15  Agreement should the City fail to receive a signed authorization evidencing such \n16  agreement.) Counsel for the MIWON Represented Individuals and counsel for the \nother Represented Individuals have also agreed among themselves on the amounts \n17 \nand manner in which attorney's fees included within the Represented Individuals' \n18 \nFund will be distributed among counsel; provided, however, that non-MIWON \n19 \nRepresented Individuals might have agreements with their counsel regarding \n20 \npercentage divisions of their settlements as a means of determining attorney's fees. \n21 \n24.  It is expressly understood that Plaintiffs' potential claim for statutory \n22 \nattorney's fees was a substantial factor in arriving upon the final settlement amount \n23 \nof$12,850,000. Although the parties did not set a specific figure for attorney's fees \n24 \nin agreeing upon the final settlement amount, they understood that the statutory \n25 \nattorney's-fee claim materially and substantially increased the final settlement \n26 \namount from what it otherwise would have been. \n27 \n25.  Except as provided under Paragraph 29, infra, and subject to the terms \n28  of Paragraph 22, supra, the City shall transfer the total settlement amount of \n12 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 29 of 98\n1  $12,850,000 via wire transfer into the \"Litt, Estuar, Harrison & Kitson Client Trust \n2  Account\". \n3  26.  After the City advances the total settlement amount referenced in the \n4  preceding paragraph into the Litt, Estuar, Harrison & Kitson Client Trust Account, \n5  a portion of that amount shall be distributed to the Trust Accounts of plaintiffs' \n6  counsel in each of the Related Cases as agreed to among all Plaintiffs' counsel. \n7  (The MIWON counsel will determine separately and among themselves how to \n8  divide attorney's fees among themselves and how to distribute the funds to the \n9  Represented Individuals they represent.) The amounts to go to each Trust Account, \n10  which constitute the complete payments to each attorney and hislher clients, \n11  inclusive of attorney's fees, client damages and all liens and costs, if any, are as \n12  follows: \nA.  Gregory Yates: $525,000 \n13 \nB.  Ellen Ellison: $40,000 \n14 \nC.  Susan Pintar: $530,000 \n15 \nD.  Luis Carrillo: $2,090,000 \n16 \nE.  Louis Krass: $50,000 \n17 \nF.  Carl Douglas: $352,000 \n18 \nG.  Leo Hernandez: $38,000 \n19 \nH.  Jaime Segall-Gutierrez: $241,000. At an earlier stage in this \n20 \nlitigation, Mr. Segall-Gutierrez represented the following individuals: \n21 \nSummer Reese, for herself and as guardian for her minor child Patrick \n22 \nReese; Geneva Reese; Ed Cotton; Pedro Reyes; Tania Torres; Miguel \n23 \nGuzman; and Nadia Khan. Those individuals are no longer represented by \n24 \nMr. Segall-Gutierrez, and they will be paid directly from the Litt, Estuar et \n25 \nal. Client Trust Account. \n26 \n1.  Litt, Estuar et al. (for MIWON): $8,984,000 (which includes the \n27 \nentire $250,000 Class Fund). \n28 \n27.  It is expressly understood and agreed upon that any and all disputes, or \n13 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 30 of 98\n1  resolution of such disputes, between or among any of the Plaintiffs, or between or \n2  among counsel for any of the Plaintiffs, or between or among any Plaintiffs, on the \n3  one hand, and their counsel, on the other, over any apportionment, division or \n4  transfer of the total settlement amount under the terms of Paragraph 26, supra, shall \n5  not entitle any such plaintiff or any such counsel to any relief whatever against the \n6  City or other Released Person, or impose any duty of any kind upon the City or \n7  other Released Person. Plaintiffs and their counsel shall hold the City and all other \n8  Released Persons harmless in any dispute, or for any alleged wrong, in any way \n9  arising out of any and all distributions referenced in Paragraph 26, supra. Plaintiffs \n10  and their respective counsel, as reflected in Exhibit E, shall respectively hold the \n11  City and all other Released Persons harmless with regard to any dispute, or alleged \n12  wrong, in any way relating to any claim by any third-party lienholder to any \n13  amount distributed to any Represented Individual herein; provided, however, that \n14  the Plaintiffs and their counsel shall only hold the City harmless under the terms of \nthis sentence to the extent that counsel for the debtor-plaintiff(s) in issue have \n15 \nreceived notice of the subject lien(s) on or before the date that the City has \n16 \ndeposited the total settlement amount into the Litt, Estuar, Harrison & Kitson Client \n17 \nTrust Account. Plaintiffs hereby expressly acknowledge receipt of the Notice of \n18 \nLien issued upon the assets of Tomasa Alvarez by LACIUSC Medical Center and \n19 \nissued by USCB, Inc. by way of letter dated December 29,2008; and Plaintiffs also \n20 \nexpressly acknowledge receipt of the Notice of Lien upon the assets of Antonio \n21 \nLopez by Presbyterian Community and issued by Health Advocates by way of letter \n22 \ndated January 28,2008. \n23 \n28.  Class Counsel shall provide a signed authorization from each \n24 \nRepresented Individual agreeing to the terms of the settlement as it relates to that \n25 \nRepresented Individual, redacted to omit personal identifying information other \n26 \nthan the Represented Individual's name and attorney, to counsel for the City, either \n27  by personal delivery or facsimile, no later than the Bar Date. The City shall be \n28  entitled to treat Class Counsel's failure to provide such a signed authorization for \n14 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 31 of 98\n1  any Represented Individual as that Represented Individual's request for exclusion \n2  from the settlement.  If any Represented Individual requests exclusion from the \n3  settlement or is otherwise excluded from the Settlement, the City shall be entitled to \n4  rescind the Settlement Agreement within 20 days after the Bar Date or date of \n5  exclusion, whichever is later.  Rescission shall return the MIWON and Related \n6  Cases to active litigation status; shall provide Plaintiffs the right to reinstate all \n7  dismissed individual defendants; and shall revoke and withdraw any and all \n8  releases from liability provided by such individual defendants.  In addition, the \n9  tolling of the statute of limitations shall terminate for the claims for relief against \n10  the individual defendants previously dismissed (such statute(s) of limitations \n11  having been tolled at the time of the dismissal) on the earlier of (a) 30 days after the \n12  rescission or (b) the filing of a notice of reinstatement of claims filed with the \n13  Court. In the event the City exercises a right of rescission in accordance with this \n14  paragraph, any funds that it has paid or otherwise has transferred or deposited \n15  pursuant to this Settlement Agreement shall be returned to it within 10 days of the \nrescission, less any expenses, fees and costs incurred by the Administrator, such \n16 \ncosts to include all sums paid to organizations pursuant to Paragraph 46, infra; \n17 \nprovided, however, that the Administrator shall make a written accounting, to \n18 \ncounsel for the City and to Class Counsel, of all such fees and costs.  The \n19 \nAdministrator shall forward its written accounting at the same time it returns any \n20 \nfunds to the City pursuant to this paragraph. \n21 \n29.  Despite the provisions of Paragraph 26, this Settlement Agreement \n22 \ncontemplates that there may be some structured settlements for individual plaintiffs. \n23 \nTo the extent there are such structured settlements, the City will enter into the \n24 \nappropriate agreements not in conflict with this Settlement Agreement or terms of \n25 \nthe Consent Judgment, and will follow any payment instructions it receives \n26 \npursuant to such structured settlements prior to directing payment of settlement \n27  funds into the Litt, Estuar, Harrison & Kitson Client Trust Account. To the extent \n28  there are such structured settlements, the City will deduct payments made pursuant \n15 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 32 of 98\n1  to such instructions from the amount subsequently transferred into the Litt, Estuar, \n2  Harrison & Kitson Client Trust Account. The City shall not enter into any \n3  structured-settlement agreements or follow any payment instructions thereunder \n4  after it directs payment to be made into the Litt, Estuar, Harrison & Kitson Client \n5  Trust Account. This Settlement Agreement fixes the total amount that the City will \n6  be responsible to pay Plaintiffs collectively, either directly or in the form of a \n7  structured settlement. To the extent there are structured settlements, they will be \n8  negotiated by counsel for individual Represented Individuals, memorialized in \n9  individual settlement agreements, and provided to the Court prior to entry of the \n10  Consent Judgment. No structured settlement shall increase the total cost of this \nsettlement to the City or impose any obligations or duties of any kind upon any \n11 \ndefendant or Released Person other than the City whatever.  Once the Consent \n12 \nJudgment becomes final, it is the Consent Judgment that constitutes the binding \n13 \nsettlement terms among the parties. Plaintiffs and their counsel shall hold harmless \n14 \nall Defendants or other Released Persons with regard to any dispute between or \n15 \namong any Plaintiffs, between or among any Plaintiffs' counsel, or between or \n16 \namong any Plaintiffs, on the one hand, and Plaintiffs' counsel, on the other, in any \n17 \nway related to any structured settlement. \n18 \n30.  Upon deposit of the total settlement amount into the Litt, Estuar, \n19 \nHarrison & Kitson Client Trust Account, payment of the Post Administration Class \n20 \nFund shall issue therefrom to the Administrator to permit payment of claims to \n21 \nUnrepresented Class Members who file timely Proof of Claim Forms that the \n22 \nAdministrator does not rej ect. Each such payment shall be issued in an amount not \n23 \nto exceed $1000. In the event that there are more such claims than can be paid in \n24 \nthe amount of $1000 from the Post Administration Class Fund without depleting it, \n25 \nthen the Post Administration Class Fund will be distributed proportionally to each \n26 \nUnrepresented Class Member who files a timely Proof of Claim Form that the \n27 \nAdministrator does not reject. If, after payment to each Unrepresented Class \n28 \nMember the amount owed under the terms of this paragraph, there are funds \n16 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 33 of 98\n1  remaining in the Post Administration Class Fund, then that remaining amount shall \n2  revert to the City. Whether or not a portion of the Post Administration Class Fund \n3  remains for reversion to the City, the Administrator shall make a written \n4  accounting, to counsel for the City and to Class Counsel, of all sums, fees, costs \n5  and expenses paid from the Class Fund, including from the Advance Payment. The \n6  Administrator shall make the accounting within 60 days from the date the \n7  Administrator receives the Post Administration Class Fund for disbursement. Along \n8  with the accounting, the Administrator shall provide Class Counsel and counsel for \n9  the City with a written report listing the total number of Proof of Claims Forms it \n10  received, the total number of claims it paid, and the total number of claims it \n11  rejected broken down by the reasons for rejection.  The City makes no \n12  representations about, and makes no guarantee to any person with regard to, the \n13  amount that will ultimately constitute the Post Administration Class Fund.  All \n14  Plaintiffs and their counsel shall hold the City and all other Released Persons \n15  harmless in any dispute in any way arising from the determination of the amount \nconstituting the Post Administration Class Fund or any transfer or distribution of \n16 \nany portion of the Post Administration Class Fund. \n17 \n31.  If the City fails to exercise any right of rescission pursuant to this \n18 \nSettlement Agreement, then after all such rights to rescind have expired, but before \n19 \nentry of the Consent Judgment, Plaintiffs shall dismiss from the above-captioned \n20 \nMIWON case and from all the Related Cases, all defendants other than the City, \n21 \nincluding each and every defendant other than the City named in the Related Cases \n22 \nlisted in Paragraph 4, supra; provided, however, that in the event the Matters \n23 \nAlleged in the Lawsuit are not resolved with a Consent Judgment that becomes \n24 \nfinal, such dismissed defendants shall be reinstated to permit the parties to proceed \n25 \nupon the Matters Alleged in the Lawsuit as the parties deem appropriate. In the \n26 \nevent of reinstatement, the applicable statute(s) of limitations governing claims for \n27 \nrelief related to Matters Alleged in the Lawsuit for each such reinstated defendant \n28  shall be tolled from the date of dismissal to the earlier of (a) 30 days after the \n17 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 34 of 98\n1  rescission or (b) the filing of a notice of reinstatement of claims filed with the \n2  Court .. Plaintiffs shall lose any right of reinstatement once the total settlement \n3  amount is deposited into the Litt, Estuar, Harrison & Kitson Client Trust Account. \n4  Notwithstanding this paragraph or any other paragraph in this Settlement \n5  Agreement, Plaintiffs shall promptly dismiss from the MIWON case and all Related \n6  Cases any defendant other than the City once Class Counsel receives a document, \n7  signed by that defendant, containing the defendant's (a) release of all Plaintiffs \n8  from any and all liability, claims for relief or actions in any way arising from the \n9  Matters Alleged in the Lawsuit, (b) acknowledgement that the defendant's \n10  dismissal under the terms of this sentence shall be withdrawn, and the defendant \nreinstated into all cases from which the defendant had been dismissed under the \n11 \n12  terms of this paragraph, should the instant settlement fail to produce a Consent \n13  Judgment that becomes final, and (c) acknowledgement that any statute(s) of \n14  limitations governing any of the Plaintiffs' claims against the defendant in any way \n15  arising from the Matters Alleged in the Lawsuit shall be tolled from the date of \ndismissal to the earlier of (a) 30 days after the rescission or (b) the filing of a notice \n16 \nof reinstatement of claims filed with the Court.  No defendant shall be dismissed \n17 \nunder the terms of the preceding sentence until and unless the Court enters a \n18 \npreliminary approval order.  Upon reinstatement of any defendant pursuant the \n19 \nterms of this paragraph, such reinstatement automatically triggers revocation and \n20 \nwithdrawal of all releases and acknowledgements on the part of that defendant \n21 \nmade under the terms of this paragraph. \n22 \nv. \nEFFECT OF SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT FOR DAMAGES \n23 \n32.  This Settlement Agreement is subject to and conditioned on a Fairness \n24 \nHearing conducted by the Court, the Court's final approval of this Settlement \n25 \nAgreement, and entry of the Consent Judgment. The Consent Judgment shall be \n26 \ndeemed final only on expiration of the time to appeal by a class member who has \n27 \nfiled a timely objection to the settlement, or if a Notice of Appeal by any such \n28  person is filed in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, upon exhaustion of all appeals \n18 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 35 of 98\n1  and petitions for writs of certiorari or the expiration of the time to file such writ \n2  petitions. Once final, the Consent Judgment shall be a judgment of this Court, \n3  binding and enforceable in accordance with the terms of this Settlement Agreement \n4  and applicable law. Subject to any continuing rights of Opt-Outs, the Consent \n5  Judgment shall: \n6  A.  Dismiss with prejudice, in the above-captioned MIWON \ncase and all Related Cases, all claims for damages or other relief against any \n7 \nand all Defendants or other Released Persons, each party therein to bear all \n8 \nits own costs and attorney's fees except as otherwise expressly provided for \n9 \nin this Settlement Agreement; \n10 \nB.  Enjoin all Damages Class Members, Structural Relief \n11 \nClass Members and Unrepresented Class Members from asserting against \n12 \nany Defendant or other Released Person any and all claims for damages or \n13 \nother relief which any such class member had, has, or may have in the future \n14 \nin any way arising out of the facts alleged, or in any way related to the claims \n15 \nfor relief pleaded, in the MIWON Complaint or Related Case Complaints, \n16 \nwhich are fully incorporated herein by reference; \n17 \nC.  Release each Defendant and other Released Person from \n18 \nall claims for damages or other relief which any Damages Class Member, \n19 \nStructural Relief Class Member or Unrepresented Class Member had, has, or \n20 \nmay have in the future, against such Defendant or other Released Person in \n21 \nany way arising out of the facts alleged, or in any way related to the claims \n22 \nfor relief pleaded, in the MIWON Complaint or Related Case Complaints; \n23 \nD.  Determine that this Settlement Agreement is entered into \n24 \nin good faith, is reasonable, fair and adequate, and in the best interest of all \n25 \nthe class members; and \n26 \nE.

Reserve the Court's continuing jurisdiction over the \n4  parties to this Settlement Agreement to enforce the terms of the separate \n5  Structural Relief Agreement and Order thereon (\"Structural Relief Order\") \n6  entered by the Court, and fully incorporated herein, regarding resolution of \n7  the injunctive relief class certified by the Court on January 8,2008. \n8  33.  The parties will take all necessary and appropriate steps to obtain \n9  preliminary and final approvals of the Settlement Agreement, dismissal of the \n10  defendants other than the City as provided in Paragraph 31, and dismissal of the \nMIWON and Related Cases with prejudice at the time the Court enters its Consent \n11 \n12  Judgment, all parties bearing all their own attorney's fees and costs unless \n13  otherwise expressly provided in this Settlement Agreement. If the Consent \n14  Judgment is entered and there is an appeal therefrom by an objector, the City will \n15  not oppose Plaintiffs' efforts to defend the Settlement Agreement and/or Consent \n16  Judgment, which shall be at Plaintiffs' sole expense. \n34.  The Consent Judgment that this Settlement Agreement contemplates \n17 \nresolves in full as of the Effective Date all claims for relief, actions, causes of \n18 \naction, or allegations of any kind that in any way arise from or relate to the Matters \n19 \nAlleged in the Lawsuit, against any or all of the Defendants and other Released \n20 \nPersons by any and all of the Represented Individuals and Unrepresented Class \n21 \nMembers, whether based upon any federal, state or local law, law of any foreign \n22 \nnation, regulation, duty, obligation, promise, ordinance or any other legal rule.

As of the Effective Date, the Represented Individuals and the \n2  Unrepresented Class Members, except Opt-outs, and all their agents, attorneys and \n3  assigns, on the one hand, and the Defendants and all of their agents, attorneys and \n4  assigns, on the other, hereby waive and release one another from any and all claims \n5  or rights to pursue, initiate, prosecute, or commence any action or proceeding \n6  against one another before any court, administrative agency or other tribunal, or to \n7  file against one another any complaint regarding acts or omissions with respect to \n8  any Matters Alleged in the Lawsuit, including but not limited to any claims of \n9  malicious prosecution or abuse of process; and further, as it relates to this mutual \n10  waiver and release, expressly waive the provisions of California Civil Code Section \n11  1542, which provides that \n\"a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not \n12 \nknow or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the \n13 \nrelease, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or \n14 \nher settlement with the debtor.\" \n15 \n36.  Upon Entry of the Consent Judgment, each Represented Individual and \n16 \nUnrepresented Class Member shall be deemed to have consented to the jurisdiction \n17 \nof the Court.  Nothing in this paragraph is intended to negate any prior or other \n18 \nconsent to this Court's jurisdiction by any Represented Individual, Unrepresented \n19 \nClass Member or other person. \n20 \nVI.  HANDLING OF MINORS' CLAIMS \n21 \n37.  Included among the Represented Individuals are minors, some of \n22 \nwhose settlements hereunder are $6000 or less, and some of whose settlements \n23 \nexceed $6000. For those minors who receive, exclusive of attorney's fees and costs, \n24 \nsettlements of $6000 or less, blocked accounts are not to be opened, and the money \n25 \nshall be paid to the parent or other guardian ad litem of the minor for general use \n26 \nfor the minor's health and well-being in whatever manner the parent or guardian \n27 \nsees fit; MIWON plaintiffs within this category, along with their counsel, are listed \n28 \nin Exhibit F. Non-MIWON counsel shall provide their own lists, in a form \n21 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 38 of 98\n1  substantially similar to Exhibit F, to Class Counsel by March 13,2009.  This \n2  paragraph does not impose any duties upon any of the Defendants or other Released \n3  Persons. \n4  38.  For those minors who receive, exclusive of attorney's fees and costs, \n5  settlements over $6000, and who are under the age of 16 as of December 31, 2009, \n6  their counsel shall cause to be opened for them blocked interest bearing bank \n7  accounts on terms further elaborated in the proposed Consent Judgment (attached \n8  as Exhibit C). MIWON plaintiffs within this category, along with their counsel, are \n9  listed in Exhibit G. Non-MIWON counsel shall provide their own lists, in a form \n10  substantially similar to Exhibit G, to Class Counsel by March 13, 2009. Counsel for \n11  any minor encompassed within the first sentence of this paragraph shall file with \n12  the Court a record of each such blocked interest bearing account within 90 days \nfrom the date the City deposits the total settlement amount into the Litt, Estuar, \n13 \n14  Harrison & Kitson Client Trust Account pursuant to Paragraph 25, supra. It shall be \n15  the duty of plaintiffs' counsel to coordinate with Class Counsel to learn the date \nthat such amount is deposited into the Litt, Estuar, Harrison & Kitson Client Trust \n16 \nAccount. This paragraph does not impose any duties upon any of the Defendants or \n17 \nother Released Persons. \n18 \n39.  Settlement funds for those minors who will be 16 years of age or older \n19 \nas of December 31, 2009, and whose individual settlements exceed $6000 exclusive \n20 \nof attorney's fees and costs, shall be maintained in their counsel's Client Trust \n21 \nAccount so that each such settlement can be expeditiously paid to each such minor \n22 \nat the time ofhis/her 18th birthday. MIWON plaintiffs within this category, along \n23 \nwith their counsel, are listed in Exhibit H. Non-MIWON counsel shall provide their \n24 \nown lists, in a form substantially similar to Exhibit H, to Class Counsel by March \n25 \n13,2009. This paragraph does not impose any duties upon any of the Defendants or \n26  other Released Persons. \n27 \n40.  The parties recognize that there may be circumstances in which a \n28  parent or other guardian has a need for the funds in a blocked account for the direct \n22 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 39 of 98\n1  and immediate benefit of a minor plaintiff with an interest in funds in a blocked \n2  account, such as for a medical emergency or braces. The Consent Judgment \n3  contains procedures under which such parents and guardians may withdraw funds \n4  in such cases without the need for court approval. \n5  VII.  HANDLING OF MISSING REPRESENTED INDIVIDUALS' CLAIMS \n6  41.  There are Represented Individuals whose whereabouts are currently \n7  unknown (\"Missing Represented Individuals\"). Plaintiffs' counsel are currently \n8  unable to secure the consent of the Missing Represented Individuals to the \nsettlement. \n9 \n42.  The Court has the authority to approve the amount of settlement for \n10 \nthe Missing Represented Individuals and to bind them under this Settlement \n11 \n12  Agreement and the Consent Judgment. Counsel for the Missing Represented \nIndividuals will send written notice to the last known address of each Missing \n13 \n14  Represented Individual, such notice to set forth the material terms of the settlement, \n15  including all waivers and releases and any sum hereunder payable to such Missing \nRepresented Individual, as those terms relate specifically to him/her. The parties \n16 \nshall request, and hereby do so request, that the Court approve settlements as shall \n17 \nbe designated for the Missing Represented Individuals. Should the Court fail to \n18 \napprove settlement for all the Missing Represented Individuals in the Consent \n19 \nJudgment, the City and other Defendants reserve the right to rescind this Settlement \n20 \nAgreement.  In the event a defendant exercises a right of rescission in accordance \n21 \nwith this paragraph, any funds that the City has paid or otherwise has transferred or \n22 \ndeposited pursuant to this Settlement Agreement shall be returned to it within 10 \n23 \ndays of the rescission, less any expenses, fees and costs incurred by the \n24 \nAdministrator, such costs to include all sums paid to organizations pursuant to \n25 \nParagraph 46, infra; provided, however, that the Administrator shall make a written \n26 \naccounting, to counsel for the City and to Class Counsel, of all such fees and costs. \n27 \nThe Administrator shall forward its written accounting at the same time it returns \n28 \nany funds to the City pursuant to this paragraph. \n23 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 40 of 98\n1  43.  Assuming the Court approval referenced in the preceding paragraph, \n2  each Missing Represented Individual's settlement funds will be placed in a \n3  separate, special interest bearing trust account, where, absent the Missing \n4  Represented Individual's appearance and claim of such funds via such Missing \n5  Represented Individual's counsel in the MIWON or Related Cases, the funds will \n6  remain until December 31, 2012. If any Missing Represented Individual has not \n7  claimed hislher funds by December 31, 2012, then the funds in the account for such \n8  individual shall revert to the City. Counsel for any Missing Represented Individual \n9  who opens a trust account pursuant to this paragraph shall, at the time the trust \n10  account is opened, provide the financial institution holding the funds written notice \n11  of the City's reversionary right and all instructions necessary to facilitate such \n12  reversion on January 1,2013. It shall then be the responsibility of the City to \n13  initiate the reversionary process and contact any holders of the trust accounts \n14  necessary to accomplish it, with which process all Plaintiffs' counsel shall \n15  cooperate. Despite the provisions of this paragraph, between January 1,2013, and \n16  December 31,2018, each Missing Represented Individual shall retain the right to \nreceive from the City (and no other person) the amount of net principal and accrued \n17 \ninterest, if any, that was in the trust account at the time the City received funds from \n18 \nit; provided, however, that said Missing Individual shall not be entitled to receive \n19 \ninterest accrued after December 31,2012, if any. The names of, and counsel for, the \n20 \nMissing Represented Individuals will be provided as an exhibit to the proposed \n21 \nConsent Judgment submitted to the Court before the Fairness Hearing. \n22 \nVIII. TERMS AND EFFECT OF SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT FOR \n23 \nSTRUCTURAL RELIEF \n24 \n44.  This Settlement Agreement contemplates the Court's separate entry of \n25 \nthe Structural Relief Order. A copy of that Order is attached to this Settlement \n26 \nAgreement at Exhibit D and incorporated as though fully set forth herein. The \n27 \nStructural Relief Order provides support for the First Amendment right to assemble \n28 \nin public places to engage in expressive activity and, thereby, provides a substantial \n24 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 41 of 98\n1  benefit to all the Rule 23(b)(2) class members. In addition, the Court has retained \n2  jurisdiction for a period of not less than four (4) years to enter any orders necessary \n3  to enforce the terms of the Structural Relief Order. \n4  IX.  CLASS COUNSEL FEES \n5  45.  The parties agree that the total settlement amount of$12,850,000 \n6  includes all attorney's fees and costs and is the total amount that the City owes \n7  hereunder. Of the $12,600,000 from the total settlement amount, Class Counsel \n8  shall seek an attorney's fee award of no more than $3,713,000, inclusive of all \n9  litigation costs, medical liens and medical costs, for the MIWON-plaintiffs' \n10  counsel. This award encompasses all the attorney's fees and costs for all the \n11  MIWON-plaintiffs' counsel, who carried the great burden of the work on behalf of \n12  all Plaintiffs' counsel in this case. To the limited extent non-MIWON plaintiffs' \ncounsel are entitled to any statutory or other attorney's fees in the Related Cases, \n13 \n14  such fees are encompassed in the amounts designated for them and their clients in \n15  Paragraph 26 (A)-(I), supra. Class Counsel shall provide the Court the amounts \nthey considered in the total amounts paid to non-MIWON plaintiffs' counsel as part \n16 \nof the fee motion. Defendants take no position on the amount of the fees and costs \n17 \nherein sought by Class Counsel. \n18 \nX.  CLASS NOTIFICATION AND CLAIMS ADMINISTRATION \n19 \n46.  In this case, there are not any known mailing lists that contain \n20 \ninformation allowing identification of Unrepresented Class Members. The most \n21 \npractical way to locate Unrepresented Class Members is through dissemination of \n22 \nClass Notices to those in contact with the organizations that organized the May 1 \n23 \nevents in and around MacArthur Park, i.e., MIWON, CHIRLA, IDEPSCA, KlWA, \n24 \nFilipino Workers Center, and Garment Workers Center. Such dissemination may be \n25 \naccomplished by distributing Class Notices and Proof of Claim Forms to members \n26 \nof the organizations and to the general population living in, and using the facilities \n27 \nof, MacArthur Park; by distributing Class Notices at various immigrant-rights \n28 \nrallies, events and meetings, if any, between the Court's preliminary approval and \n25 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 42 of 98\n1  the Claim Cut-Off Date; and by other means of outreach as the Court may order. \n2  Accordingly, the Court authorizes each such organization to be paid up to $4000 \n3  (with the actual amount to be determined by Class Counsel in consultation with the \n4  Administrator) from the Class Fund as a cost of class administration. These \n5  expenditures shall be funded from the Advance Payment or, if necessary, from the \n6  Class Fund. In exchange, each such organization must devote 100 hours to \n7  distribution of Class Notices in areas in which the organization believes it most \n8  likely that Unrepresented Class Members may be present. Each such organization \n9  shall complete its dissemination of Class Notices and Proof of Claim Forms no later \n10  than May 6,2009, and shall further provide the Administrator written attestation of \ncompliance with the provisions of this paragraph, including compliance with the \n11 \n100-hour distribution requirement herein, no later than the Claim Cut-Off Date. The \n12 \n13  Administrator shall file all such attestations with the Court no later than June 3, \n14  2009. \n47.  All Class Notices shall include a Proof of Claim Form to be used in \n15 \nconnection with any claims made against the Class Fund. (See Exhibit B.) The \n16 \nProof of Claim Form shall require a statement, made under penalty of perjury, that \n17 \nthe individual (1) was present on May 1, 2007, in the geographic area bounded by \n18 \n6th Street (on the north), Alvarado Street (on the east), 7th Street (on the south), \n19 \nand Park View Street (on the west), or the immediately adjacent areas, including \n20 \nfrom 6th Street west to Lafayette Park, at some point between the hours of 5 :00 \n21 \np.m. and 7:00 p.m., (2) did not engage in any conduct justifying Defendants' \n22 \ndispersal order or the use of force, and (3) was subjected to the LAPD's use of \n23 \nforce, dispersal order or other unlawful police activity arising from the police \n24 \nresponse to the immigration march and rally. The Proof of Claim Form shall require \n25 \nan additional statement in the claimant's own words setting forth specific facts \n26 \nsupporting his/her claim against the Class Fund. \n27 \n48.  The Administrator shall be responsible for publishing a summary Class \n28 \nNotice in La Opinion, once a week for at least three consecutive weeks beginning \n26 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 43 of 98\n1  no later than the week of March 30, 2009. The parties agree that La Opinion is the \n2  publication most likely to reach Unrepresented Class Members. \n3  49.  Except for publication of summary Class Notice in La Opinion, \n4  preparation of approximately 10,000 Class Notices for distribution, and provision \n5  of Class Notices to those who request them from the Administrator, the \n6  Administrator's only responsibilities shall be (a) to process and pay class claims, \n7  (b) to process Unrepresented Class Members' objections and requests for exclusion, \n8  (c) to file attestations as provided in paragraph 46, supra, (d) to use the database(s) \n9  normally used by the Administrator to verify the social security number or TIN a \n10  claimant has provided on the Proof of Claim Form (\"SS Database\") (see Paragraph \n52, infra); (e) to select the Investigator referenced in Paragraph 54, infra, and cause \n11 \n12  investigations to be undertaken upon request from the City; (f) to provide \ndocuments required by court orders to finalize the class settlement, (g) to provide \n13 \n14  the accountings, reports and notices to parties and/or counsel, including the total \n15  number of Opt-Outs under Paragraph 63, infra, pursuant to the terms of this \nSettlement Agreement, (h) to provide and maintain the lists of rejected claims \n16 \npursuant to Paragraph 57, infra, (i) to return to the City any unused portion of the \n17 \nPost Administration Class Fund or Advance Payment, (j) to return to the City any \n18 \nfunds due the City upon rescission of the Settlement Agreement, and (k) to perform \n19 \nany other tasks specified for it in this Settlement Agreement. \n20 \n50.  A Proof of Claim Form shall be deemed timely submitted when \n21 \nreceived by the Administrator, or postmarked for delivery to the Administrator, on \n22 \nor before the Claim Cut-Off Date. \n23 \n51.  An Unrepresented Class Member's objection to or request for \n24 \nexclusion from the settlement shall be deemed timely submitted if received by the \n25 \nAdministrator, or postmarked for delivery to the Administrator, on or before the \n26  Bar Date. \n27 \n52.  Prior to payment of any Unrepresented Class Member's claim against \n28 \nthe Class Fund, the Administrator shall ensure that every claimant has provided all \n27 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 44 of 98\n1  the information required by the terms of the Proof of Claim Form.  The \n2  Administrator shall also take such other steps as it deems reasonably necessary to \n3  satisfy itself that claimants were present at MacArthur Park between the hours of \n4  5:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. on May 1, and that there is a factual basis for the claims. \n5  These steps may include (a) checking a social security number or TIN appearing on \n6  a Proof of Claim Form, (b) comparing the name of any claimant to the name listed \n7  in the SS Database, (c) checking with witnesses listed in the Proof of Claim Form, \n8  (d) communicating with the claimant, and (e) otherwise following up on claims. \n9  The Administrator shall preliminarily reject any claim upon discovery of any claim \n10  in which a social security number or TIN has been used on more than one Proof of \nClaim Form.  The Administrator shall similarly preliminarily reject any claim in \n11 \n12  which the claimant has not provided all the information required by the terms of the \n13  Proof of Claim Form. If the Administrator rejects a claim under the terms of the \n14  preceding sentences in this paragraph, such rejection shall not be final.  Instead, the \n15  Administrator shall provide the claimant a deficiency notice by First Class Mail, \nand such written notice shall (1) identify the deficiency or deficiencies in the claim \n16 \nand (2) designate a 30-day time limit to provide an opportunity for the claimant to \n17 \ncure all deficiencies. The Administrator shall prepare form deficiency notices and \n18 \nprovide them to the parties, who shall have the opportunity to make suggestions \n19 \nregarding the final forms. In determining whether to finally accept or reject a claim, \n20 \nit shall be the responsibility of the Administrator to assess the accuracy and \n21 \nreliability of the claim, including the claimant's response to any deficiency notice. \n22 \nIf, upon the expiration of the 30-day period after mailing a deficiency notice, no \n23 \nwritten explanation is received by, or postmarked for delivery to, the Administrator, \n24 \nthe Administrator shall finally reject that claim.  The Administrator may finally \n25 \nreject a claim that remains deficient notwithstanding the claimant's response to a \n26 \ndeficiency notice. \n27 \n53.  Immediately upon entry of the Consent Judgment, the Administrator \n28 \nshall provide to Class Counsel and counsel for the City, via U.S. Mail, redacted \n28 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 45 of 98\n1  copies of all Proof of Claim Forms that the Administrator determines warrant \n2  payment from the Class Fund. The Administrator shall redact such copies to omit \n3  all information on each Proof of Claim Form except the specific facts set forth by \n4  the claimant to support the claim and the unique Proof of Claim Form number, \n5  which the Administrator shall assign to each Proof of Claim Form. Only the \n6  Administrator and any Investigator it selects pursuant to Paragraph 54 shall be \n7  privy to the other information contained in the Proof of Claim Forms, subject to the \n8  terms of Paragraph 64, infra. In providing counsel with the redacted copies herein, \n9  the Administrator shall identify, by cover letter or other means, all Proof of Claim \n10  Forms that the Administrator does not intend to pay, or intends to send deficiency \nnotices on, for whatever reason. If a Proof of Claim Form has not been so \n11 \ndesignated, that means the Administrator intends to pay the claim without further \n12 \n13  mqUIry. \n14  54.  Upon receipt of the redacted copies of Proof of Claim Forms \n15  referenced in the preceding paragraph, the City shall be entitled to designate Proof \nof Claim Forms on which it wishes to cause an investigation to be conducted by a \n16 \nprivate, neutral investigator (\"Investigator\") of the Administrator's choosing, into \n17 \ntruthfulness and merits of any claim raised. In addition, the City may designate \n18 \ncategories of claims to be investigated, e.g., claims where more than a certain \n19 \nnumber of individuals use the same address or claims where the same witness is \n20 \nlisted for unrelated claimants. The Administrator shall cause investigations in such \n21 \ncases to be undertaken by the Investigator. The Investigator shall conduct \n22 \ninvestigations with all due speed. The Investigator shall provide the written results \n23 \nof his/her investigation, including a written conclusion whether the Investigator is \n24 \nreasonably satisfied that the claim is meritorious, to the Administrator. If the \n25 \nAdministrator concludes that the claim lacks merit, then the Administrator shall \n26 \nsend the claimant a deficiency notice and afford the claimant 30 days from the date \n27 \nthe deficiency notice is mailed to provide a written explanation, under penalty of \n28 \nperjury, for the deficiency. If, upon the expiration of the 30-day period, no written \n29 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 46 of 98\n1  explanation is received by, or postmarked for delivery to, the Administrator, the \n2  Administrator shall reject the claim. If the Claimant timely responds to the \n3  deficiency notice, the Administrator and the Investigator shall confer.  If the \n4  Administrator determines that the weight of the evidence in the Proof of Claim \n5  Form and response to the deficiency notice indicates that the claim lacks merit, the \n6  claim will be rejected.  If the Administrator concludes that the weight of the \n7  evidence indicates that the claim is meritorious, the claim will be honored and paid. \n8  Nothing in this paragraph or any other paragraph in this Settlement Agreement shall \n9  require the Administrator or Investigator to inquire into any claimant's citizenship \n10  or immigration status. \n11  55.  Class Counsel shall receive copies of all requests regarding possible \n12  investigations of claims and may submit their views regarding the propriety of any \ninvestigation sought, and their reasons therefore. Such views expressed by Class \n13 \n14  Counsel shall not affect the Administrator's duty to cause an investigation to be \n15  undertaken upon request by the City. \n56.  The costs of all investigations under Paragraph 54, but not activities \n16 \nlisted in Paragraph 52, shall be at the City'S sole expense, to be paid by the City \n17 \nbased upon bills sent by the Administrator. Accordingly, no portion of the Class \n18 \nFund, as defined herein, shall be used to pay for any investigation or verification of \n19 \nclass claims under Paragraph 54. \n20 \n57.  The Administrator will prepare a list of all rejected claims, with the \n21 \nreasons for rej ection, and maintain the list until at least December 31, 2014. \n22 \n58.  The Parties agree that untimely filed Proof of Claim Forms shall be \n23 \nfinally rejected by the Administrator and no payments thereon shall be made. \n24 \nXI.  EXCLUSION FROM SETTLEMENT CLASS: OPT-OUTS \n25 \n59.  Any Unrepresented Class Member who wishes to be excluded from \n26 \nthe terms of this Settlement Agreement must submit a request for exclusion by the \n27 \nBar Date. The request for exclusion must be delivered to the Administrator, or \n28  postmarked for delivery to the Administrator, on or before the Bar Date. \n30 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 47 of 98\n1  60.  Each Unrepresented Class Member who requests exclusion from, or \n2  objects to, this settlement shall be deemed to have consented to the jurisdiction of \n3  the Court with respect to hislher claim, if any. \n4  61.  Any Unrepresented Class Member who does not request exclusion \n5  from the settlement as set forth in this Settlement Agreement shall conclusively be \n6  deemed to be bound by the Settlement Agreement and Consent Judgment, including \n7  all release provisions, as well as by all subsequent proceedings, orders and \n8  judgments herein. \n9  62.  Any Unrepresented Class Member who becomes an Opt-Out shall not \n10  share in any monetary benefits provided by this Settlement Agreement. \n63.  The Administrator will report in writing, via facsimile and electronic \n11 \n12  mail, to counsel for the City and Class Counsel the names of, and total number of, \n13  all Opt-Outs no later than 10 days after the Bar Date. If the total number of Opt-\n14  Outs exceeds 25, the City, in its sole discretion, may rescind this Settlement \n15  Agreement. In exercising this right of rescission, the City shall provide the \nAdministrator and Class Counsel with written notice of rescission within 20 days \n16 \nafter receipt of the Administrator's report providing the total number of Opt-Outs. \n17 \nIn the event the City exercises the right of rescission in accordance with this \n18 \nparagraph, any funds paid or deposited pursuant to this Settlement Agreement shall \n19 \nbe returned to the City within 10 days of the rescission, less any expenses, fees and \n20 \ncosts incurred by the Administrator, such costs to include all sums paid to \n21 \norganizations pursuant to Paragraph 46, supra.  Rescission shall return the MIWON \n22 \nand Related Cases to active litigation status and result in other actions as set forth in \n23 \nParagraph 28, supra. \n24 \n64.  The Administrator shall maintain copies of all Opt-Out forms and data. \n25 \nIf the City does not rescind pursuant to the preceding paragraph, and one or more \n26 \nOpt-Outs sue upon Matters Alleged in the Lawsuit, any of the Defendants may \n27 \ninquire of the Administrator for identifying information, not previously provided, \n28  reasonably necessary to determine whether the individual suing opted out of the \n31 \nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 48 of 98\n1  settlement. \n2  XII.  INTEGRATION \n3  65.  This Settlement Agreement, together with all exhibits and other \n4  documents expressly incorporated herein by reference, supersedes all prior and \n5  contemporaneous written or oral agreements and understandings between or among \n6  the signatories hereto or their representatives, agents or principals regarding the \n7  matters contained herein.

City ofL os Angeles, et al., Case No. CV 07-3072 AHM (FMOx). \nThis Class Notice is available on line at www.maydaylitigation.comorby calling toll-free: 1 -\n----\nA class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court, Central District of California, alleging that the Los \nAngeles Police Department violated civil rights by declaring an unlawful assembly and forcing people out of MacArthur \nPark and surrounding areas. The Court has certified the case as a class action.  The parties have reached a proposed \nsettlement. If the proposed settlement receives final court approval, class members are eligible to receive money. \nIf you 1) were present on May 1, 2007, in or around the MacArthur Park area at any point between the hours of \n5:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m., 2) did not engage in any conduct justifying Defendants' dispersal order or the use of force, \nand 3) were subjected to the Los Angeles Police Department's use of force, dispersal order or other unlawful police \nactivity arising from the police response to the immigration march and rally, you may be entitled to MONEY as a \nCLASS MEMBER. \nThis case was filed as a class action because it affected a large number of people who were at or near MacArthur Park on \nMay 1, 2007. Many individuals with serious physical or psychological injuries went to lawyers and are included \nindividually in the settlement. The settlement for these 297 people constitutes the great majority of the settlement of \n$12,850,000. \nHowever, the parties agreed that, in addition to the 297 represented individuals, there were others who qualified as class \nmembers, many of whom experienced minor injuries. Thus, a CLASS FUND of $250,000 (including costs of \nadministration) was established for such individuals. This $250,000 fund approximately $200,000 after class \nadministration costs) will be divided equally among those who file claims, up to a maximum of$1000 per person. If \nmoney is left after such a distribution, it will be returned to the City of Los Angeles. \nATTORNEY'S FEES: There will be a claim for attorney's fees based on the recovery for the individual plaintiffs and \nthe changes in policy mandated by the settlement. The attorney's fees will come from a separate fund set up for the \nrepresented individuals and will be based upon the legal standards governing attorney fee awards. It will not exceed \n$3,713,000 (including fees, litigation costs, and medical liens and medical costs). A fees motion will be filed on April 20, \n2009. No attorney's fees will be taken out of the $250,000 class fund described above. You may object to the fees \nrequested by filing a timely objection. \nEXCLUDING YOURSELF (DEADLINE: APRIL 27): All class members have the right to exclude themselves or \"opt \nout\" from the settlement.

The processing of these claims forms \n15 \nhas not been completed. \n16 \n25.  The Court [w  ill/will not] allow the late claims filed between May 15 \n17 \nand  to be considered and paid. \n18 \nVI.  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT APPROVED BECAUSE FAIR, \n19 \nADEQUATE, AND REASONABLE. \n20 \n26.  The settlement of this Lawsuit was not the product of collusion \n21 \nbetween Plaintiffs and Defendants or their respective counsel, but rather was the \n22 \nresult of bona fide and arm's-length negotiation conducted in good faith by the \n23 \nParties and their counsel, with the assistance of an independent mediator, who is a \n24 \nsitting United States Magistrate Judge. \n25 \n27.  The Settlement Agreement and the settlement set forth therein are \n26 \nhereby approved and found to be fair, adequate, reasonable, in the best interest of \n27 \nthe Class as a whole, and in satisfaction of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil \n28 \nProcedure and due process requirements. \n5 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 65 of 98\n1  VII.  DISTINCTION BETWEEN REPRESENTED INDIVIDUALS AND \n2  REMAINING CLASS MEMBERS \n3  28.  The Court is aware that the parties have settled this case as a hybrid \n4  settlement. The MIWON counsel represented both the certified class and_ \n5  individual class members who alleged they had been injured as a result of the \n6  actions of the LAPD on May 1. In addition, the cases listed in ~ 5, supra, represent \na combined additional  individuals who also alleged they had been injured as a \n7 \nresult of the actions of the LAPD on May 1. These are collectively the \n8 \n\"Represented Individuals\" as defined above.  Each of the Represented Individuals \n9 \nis to receive the same amount of compensation as every other Represented \n10 \nIndividual with similar injuries, but no additional damages have been awarded \n11 \nbased on an individual's role as a class representative.  The Court is also aware \n12 \nthat the Represented Individuals are receiving significantly higher amounts than \n13 \nare the Remaining Class Members (defined above). The Court fmds this \n14 \ndistinction appropriate under the unique circumstances of this case for the \n15 \nfollowing reasons: \n16 \nA. In the mediation process, the plaintiffs presented evidence that the \n17 \nRepresented Individuals were in fact present at the events in question \n18 \nthrough individualized analysis of witness statement, photographs and \n19 \nthe like, which is not the case for the Remaining Class Members. \n20 \nB. In the mediation process, the plaintiffs presented evidence of the \n21 \nparticular circumstances of each Represented Individual, and all parties \n22 \nwere able to assess damages for those individuals, which is not the case \n23 \nfor the Remaining Class Members. \n24 \nC. Plaintiffs presented evidence in the mediation process indicating that \n25 \nmost of the Represented Individuals suffered significant physical and \n26 \npsychological injuries. \n27 \nD. It is the assessment of both parties, and the Court concurs, that most of \n28  those who suffered serious injuries as a result of the matters alleged in \n6 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 66 of 98\n1  the lawsuit were included among the Represented Individuals, especially \n2  in light of the widespread publicity about the events and the ensuing \n3  lawsuits. \n4  E.  The City's offer to settle the case in the amount it did was driven almost \nexclusively by its assessment of the Represented Individuals' claims. It \n5 \nwas Class Counsel who insisted that the Class Fund be established for \n6 \nthose who qualify as Damages Class Members and were not Represented \n7 \nIndividuals. \n8 \nF.  The Class Fund established in this settlement is designed to compensate \n9 \nDamages Class Members who did not receive serious injuries. If there are \n10 \na few who did, they have the right to opt out of the settlement. [The fact \n11 \nthat only _  did so is an indication that the assessment that most serious \n12 \ninjuries were included among the Represented Individuals was correct.] \n13 \n14  VIII. NOTICE \n29.  As required by this Court in its Preliminary Approval Order: (a) Class \n15 \nNotices were distributed by the five organizational plaintiffs to inform as many \n16 \nindividuals as was practicable of the settlement and the claims process; and (b) \n17 \nClass and Settlement Notice was published in a summary fashion as set forth in \n18 \nthe Settlement Agreement and in the Preliminary Approval Order, all as more \n19 \nfully set forth in the Declaration of the Class Administrator, dated ____:  \n20 \n21 \n30.  The notice given to the Remaining Class Members is hereby \n22 \ndetermined to be fully in compliance with the requirements of Rule 23 of the \n23 \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure and due process and is found to be the best \n24 \nnotice practicable under the circumstances and to constitute due and sufficient \n25 \nnotice to all parties entitled thereto. \n26 \n31.  Due and adequate notice of the proceedings having been given to the \n27 \nClass and a full opportunity having been offered to the Class to participate in this \n28 \nhearing, it is hereby determined that all Class Members, except those who have \n7 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 67 of 98\n1  opted out of the settlement are bound by this Final Order of Approval and \n2  Settlement. Exhibit 1 contains the list of the  individuals who opted out of \n--\n3  the settlement. \n4  IX.  CLASS-WIDE PROSPECTIVE RELIEF \n5  32.  The Court has entered a separate Order addressing class-wide \nprospective relief and retaining jurisdiction to enforce the terms of that Order for a \n6 \nperiod of no less than four (4) years.  A copy of the Order is attached as Exhibit 2 \n7 \nto this Order and incorporated as though fully set forth in this Settlement \n8 \nAgreement. \n9 \nDAMAGES SETTLEMENT \n10  X. \n33.  $12,600,000 of the total settlement of$12,850,000 shall go to cover \n11 \nthe claims of the Represented Individuals, including statutory attorney's fees, costs \n12 \nand any outstanding liens. Counsel for the MIWON Represented Individuals and \n13 \nthe other Represented Individuals have agreed among themselves as to how much \n14 \nmoney will be provided to each of the Represented Individuals. Counsel for the \n15 \nMIWON Represented Individuals and the other Represented Individuals have also \n16 \nagreed among themselves how any Class Fund Attorney's fees will be distributed \n17 \namong Counsel. In addition, in the case ofnon-MIWON Represented Individuals, \n18 \nthey may have agreements with their counsel regarding percentage division of \n19 \ntheir settlements. The amount of attorney's fees and costs approved by the Court is \n20 \naddressed in 'iI_ below. \n21 \n34.  The Settlement Agreement provides for a total of $12,600,000 \n22 \n(whether via direct payment or structured settlement) to be paid to the_ \n23 \nrepresented individuals and a residual class fund of $250,000 (inclusive of costs of \n24 \nclass administration). The counsel who are signatories to the Settlement \n25 \nAgreement (Exhibit A to the Preliminary Approval Order) have warranted 1) that \n26 \nthey have authority from each represented individual whom they represent \n27 \nindividually to settle the cases on the terms set forth herein, 2) that each of their \n28  clients is aware of and has authorized the amount each will receive from the \n8 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 68 of 98\n1  settlement, and 3) that each of their clients are aware of and has approved the \n2  attorney's fee arrangement between counsel and client. \n3  35.  ,-r regarding any structured settlements. \n4  36.  Within 30 days from the Effective Date of Settlement, all settlement \nfunds shall be deposited into the Litt, Estuar Trust Account, and from there shall \n5 \nbe distributed by wire to the Trust Accounts of the counsel in each of the Related \n6 \nCases as agreed to among the parties, and from each respective trust account shall \n7 \nbe distributed to the clients or counsel, as has been agreed to among the parties \n8 \nand counsel, (The MIWON counsel will determine among themselves how to \n9 \ndistribute the funds to the Represented Individuals they represent.) The amounts to \n10 \ngo to the non-MIWON Attorney Trust Accounts (inclusive of their proportionate \n11 \nshare of the Awarded Attorney's Fees) is as follows: \n12 \nA.  Gregory Yates: $525,000 \n13 \nB.  Ellen Ellison: $40,000 \n14 \nC.  Susan Pintar: $530,000 \n15 \nD.  Luis Carrillo: $2,090,000 \n16 \nE.  Louis Krass: $50,000 \n17 \nF.  Carl Douglas: $352,000 \n18 \nG.  Leo Hernandez: $38,000 \n19 \nH.  Jaime Segall- Guttierrez: $401,000 \n20 \nI.  Litt, Estuar et al. (for MIWON clients and counsel): $8,864,000 \n21 \n37.  In addition, within thirty (30) calendar days of the Effective Date for \n22 \nPayment, the Defendants shall deposit or cause to be deposited by wire an amount \n23 \nof same day available funds, into the Class Fund equal to $250,000 less the \n24 \namount already advanced to the Class Administrator under the terms of the \n25 \nStipulated Order Granting Preliminary Approval to Class Settlement for \n26 \ndistribution to the class members ho filed claims and are not Represented \n27 \nIndividuals. \n28  38.  A class member not listed in Exhibit E to the Preliminary Approval \n9 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 69 of 98\n1  Order who filed a timely claim form shall be paid $1000, or, in the event that there \n2  are more claims than can be paid in that amount from the Post-Administration \n3  Class Fund without depleting it before all class claimants are paid, then the Post-\n4  Administration Class Fund will be distributed proportionally to each class member \n5  who filed a timely claim. [This will be modified to reflect the actual amount when \n6  we know it.] \n7  XI.  HANDLING OF MINORS' CLAIMS FOR REPRESENTED \n8  INDIVIDUALS \n9  39.  Included among the Represented Individuals are minors, some of \nwhose recoveries are $6000 or less and some of whose recoveries exceed $6000. \n10 \nFor those minors who receive after attorney's fees and costs $6000 or less, \n11 \nblocked accounts need not be opened, and the money shall be paid to the parents \n12 \nor guardians of the minor for general use for the minor's health and well-being in \n13 \nwhatever manner the parent or guardian sees fit. For those minors who receive, \n14 \nafter attorney's fees and costs, over $6000, blocked interest bearing bank accounts \n15 \nshall be opened for those who will not tum 16 by the end of this year. For those \n16 \nminors who receive, after attorney's fees and costs, over $6000, their funds shall \n17 \nbe maintained in their individual counsel's Client Trust Account so that they can \n18 \nth \nbe expeditiously paid to the client at the time of hislher 18 birthday. The names \n19 \nand categories of those minors addressed by this and the next two paragraphs are \n20 \nlisted in Exhibit 3 to this Order. A record of each blocked account - which \n21 \nincludes the minor's name, date of birth, parent's or guardian's name, and current \n22 \naddress; and the name and branch of the bank in which the account is opened and \n23 \nthe account number - must be filed with the Court within 90 days from the \n24 \nEffective Date of this Order. \n25 \n40.  The Court recognizes that there may be circumstances in which a \n26 \nparent has a need for the funds in a blocked account for the direct and immediate \n27 \nbenefit of the child plaintiff, such as for a medical emergency or braces. The Court \n28 \nauthorizes the withdrawal of funds from the blocked account for such a purpose \n10 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 70 of 98\n1  with the written concurrence of the counsel for that minor listed in Exhibit 3 to \n2  this Order. The written concurrence shall memorialize the reasons for the \n3  withdrawal, and a copy shall be filed with the financial institution where the funds \n4  are maintained, which shall keep such record until the minor reaches maturity and \n5  withdraws the funds. The maximum allowed number of such withdrawals is two. \n6  41.  In that regard, the Court authorizes the use of $5000 for minor \n7  plaintiff  to pay for braces without further order of court or approval of \n8  counsel. \n9  XII.  HANDLING OF ABSENT REPRESENTED INDIVIDUALS' CLAIMS \n10  42.  There are Represented Individuals whose present whereabouts are \n11  unknown (\"Missing Represented Individuals\"). Plaintiffs' counsel have ranked \n12  Missing Represented Individuals' settlement within the grid system utilized for the \nRepresented Individuals, but are unable to secure the consent of the Missing \n13 \nRepresented Individuals to the settlement. The names of the Missing Represented \n14 \nIndividuals, and the amounts of their settlement after attorney's fees and costs, as \n15 \ndetermined by the Counsel whom they retained, are contained in Exhibit 4. \n16 \n43.  The Court fmds that Plaintiffs' counsel made diligent efforts to locate \n17 \nthe Missing Represented Individuals, which efforts were unsuccessful. These \n18 \nefforts included calling, mailing and trying to make personal contact. \n19 \n44.  Plaintiffs request that the Court authorize that the funds designated for \n20 \nthe Missing Represented Individuals set forth in Exhibit 4 be placed in a special \n21 \ntrust account because the Court has jurisdiction over, and the authority to bind, \n22 \nany class member who has not opted out, and none of the Missing Represented \n23 \nIndividuals has opted out. \n24 \n45.  Class members must be adequately represented by Class Counsel and \n25 \nafforded due process in order to be bound by a class settlement or judgment. Thus, \n26 \nin class actions, personal jurisdiction for judgment purposes may be exercised over \n27 \nnonresident class members, even those without minimum contacts with the forum, \n28 \nand without affirmative opt-in consent having been made, so long there has been \n11 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 71 of 98\n1  the best notice practicable under the circumstances, and an opportunity for class \n2  members to exclude themselves from the litigation. Phillips Petroleum Co. v. \n3  Shutts, 472 U.S. 797, 808, 105 S. Ct. 2965, 86 L. Ed. 2d 628,2 Fed. R. Servo 3d \n4  797 (1985). The Court finds that such due process requirements have been met \n5  here, and that it accordingly may bind even those individuals who are individual \nplaintiffs who are now absent if they have not opted out. Accordingly, the Court \n6 \nconcludes that Class Counsel's proposal is proper. \n7 \n46.  This is especially so because, without the Court approving the \n8 \nsettlement for the Missing Represented Individuals, the Missing Represented \n9 \nIndividuals, if they are named parties, would be subject to a motion for dismissal \n10 \nwith prejudice for failure to prosecute their case, under F.R.Civ.P. Rule 41(b). See, \n11 \ne.g., Henderson  Duncan, 779 F .2d 1421, 1423 (9th Cir.1986) (in ruling on a \nV. \n12 \nmotion under Rule 41 (b), the Court considers several factors, including, \"( 1) the \n13 \npublic's interest in expeditious resolution of litigation; (2) the court's need to \n14 \nmanage its docket; (3) the risk of prejudice to the defendants; (4) the public policy \n15 \nfavoring disposition of cases on their merits and (5) the availability of less drastic \n16 \nsanctions\"); Aziz v.  Wright, 34 F.3d 587 (8th Cir. 1994) (plaintiff twice appeared \n17 \nfor deposition but refused each time to be deposed; case properly dismissed for \n18 \nfailure to prosecute after court ordered plaintiff to be deposed and he failed to \n19 \ncomply). If they are not named parties, they would be bound by the settlement \n20 \neven though they were receiving no funds. \n21 \n47.  The Court finds that it is in the interest of the Missing Represented \n22 \nIndividuals, and of the class as a whole, to include the Missing Represented \n23 \nIndividuals in the settlement on the terms proposed, and that it has the authority to \n24 \ndo so in the context of this class action without the approval of the Missing \n25 \nRepresented Individuals. Accordingly, Class counsel shall open special interest \n26 \nbearing trust accounts for each such client. If the client has not claimed the funds \n27 \nby December 31, 2012, then the funds in such account shall be paid to the Central \n28  American Resource Center (\"CARECEN\"), whose mission is to protect and \n12 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 72 of 98\n1  promote the rights and opportunities of low-income immigrants and their family \n2  members, as a cy pres payment, to be used for the purpose of its activities relating \n3  to ensuring immigrants' rights. \n4  48.  The Missing Represented Individuals will be bound by this Order in \n5  the same manner as any other class member who has not opted out. \n6  XIII. CLASS FUND ATTORNEYS' FEES \n7  49.  Plaintiffs have filed a Motion for Attorney's Fees requesting payment \n8  of $_  __ in attorney's fees and $ _  in costs. The Court approves this request \nand is entering a separate order addressing it [including addressing the objections \n9 \nthereto]. \n10 \n50.  The Court is also advised that, pursuant to contract terms between \n11 \nattorney and client, some of the non-MIWON attorneys - but not the MIWON \n12 \ncounsel-may receive a percentage of the client's recovery, as negotiated between \n13 \nattorney and client. Since these agreements are in the non-MIWON cases, they do \n14 \nnot require court approval. Nonetheless, in an excess of caution, the Court \n15 \napproves such an arrangement to the same extent that such an arrangement would \n16 \nbe permissible in an individual representation case. \n17 \nXIV.  CLASS ADMINISTRATOR \n18 \n51.  The Court reaffirms the appointment of ____ as Class \n19 \nAdministrator (hereby \" ___\" ). The Court authorizes the payment, to be made \n20 \nimmediately by the Defendants, of $  to cover's expenses to date. \n21 \nWhen and if the class distribution goes forward (i.e., if there is no appeal or there \n22 \nis an appeal and the settlement is approved at the appellate level or abandoned), \n23 \nthen  will receive all the funds due to be paid to the Settlement Fund in \n24 \naccord with the provisions of,-r _, supra. \n25 \n52.  The Claims Administrator shall preserve all written communications \n26 \nfrom Class Members in response to the Class at least until December 31, 2012, or \n27 \npursuant to further order of the Court. All written communications received by the \n28  Claims Administrator from Class Members relating to the Settlement Agreement \n13 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 73 of 98\n1  shall be available at all reasonable times for inspection and copying by Counsel \n2  for the Parties. \nxv. \n3  CLASS NOTICE \n4  53.  The Claims Administrator has served and filed a sworn statement \nattesting to compliance with the provisions of the Preliminary Approval Order \n5 \ngoverning Class and Settlement Notice. \n6 \n54.  The Court finds that the notice required by the Preliminary Approval \n7 \nOrder was the best notice practicable under the circumstances and constituted due \n8 \nand sufficient notice of the Settlement and the Fairness Hearing to all Class \n9 \nMembers and other persons affected by and/or entitled to participate in the \n10 \nsettlement, in full compliance with the notice requirements of Rule 23 Federal \n11 \nRules of Civil Procedure and due process. \n12 \nXVI.  GENERAL PROVISIONS \n13 \n55.  Claim forms not received or postmarked by  ,2009, shall not \n14 \nbe paid, although such persons shall nonetheless be bound by this Order. \n15 \n56.  All class members except those who timely filed opt-out forms shall \n16 \nbe bound by this Order. \n17 \n57.  Except as otherwise provided in this Order, each party shall bear its \n18 \nown costs, expenses and attorneys' fees. \n19 \n58.  The use of the masculine gender herein is construed to include the \n20 \nfeminine and/or the neuter where applicable. The use of the singular herein is to be \n21 \nconstrued to include the plural where applicable. The use of the plural herein shall \n22 \nbe construed to include the singular where applicable. \n23 \n59.  Late claims filed after the Bar Date, through the date of this Order, \n24 \n[shaW shall not] be permitted. Any claims filed after the date of this Order shall \n25 \nnot be permitted. \n26 \n60.  The Court reserves and maintains jurisdiction over this settlement and \n27 \nits provisions, and over the claims administration and distribution of the funds. \n28 \nDisagreements between the parties on any disputes or unresolved aspects of this \n14 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 74 of 98\n1  Order as it relates to monetary relief shall be subject to mediation before the \n2  mediator who has mediated this case to date [Magistrate Judge Woehrle]. If \n3  mediation is not successful, the matter shall be brought to this Court for resolution. \n4  61.  At the conclusion of the Class Distribution, the Class Administrator \n5  shall submit a report to the Court summarizing the payments made to the Class. \n6  XVII. FINAL RESOLUTION \n7  62.  The monetary relief provided for in this Order shall compensate for all \n8  alleged violations of rights and all claims by the Damages Class Members on \nmatters alleged in the lawsuit under any theory of liability related to the events of \n9 \nMay 1, 2007, that come within the Damages Class definition, except as to \n10 \nmonetary damages for those class members who opt out. \n11 \n63.  The Court hereby dismisses the Lawsuit on the merits, with prejudice, \n12 \nand without further costs, with such dismissal subject only to compliance by the \n13 \nParties with the terms and conditions of the Settlement Agreement, the Order on \n14 \nthe injunctive relief class claims, and this Final Order of Approval and Settlement. \n15 \n64.  The Damages and Injunctive Relief Class Members, including the \n16 \nRepresented Individuals, and including their agents, attorneys and assigns, are \n17 \nhereby severally and permanently barred and enjoined, to the fullest extent \n18 \npermitted by law, from filing, commencing, instituting, maintaining, prosecuting \n19 \nor participating in a lawsuit or any other proceeding against the Defendants, \n20 \nincluding the employees, entities, agents, attorneys and insurers of Defendants, \n21 \ninvolving or based on any of the claims encompassed by the MIWON complaint \n22 \nor the complaints in the related cases covered by this Settlement and Order, \n23 \nincluding specifically claims on behalf of any class member whose claims are \n24 \ncovered by this Settlement and Order. \n25 \n65.  The Named Plaintiffs and each Class Member waive all rights or \n26 \nbenefits which he or she now has or in the future may have under the terms of \n27 \nCalifornia Civil Code § 1542, arising from, alleged in, or pertaining to the matters \n28 \nalleged in the Lawsuit, specifically claims related to the events of May 1, 2007, \n15 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 75 of 98\n1  that come within the Damages Class definition, except as to monetary damages for \n2  those class members who have opted out. Section 1542 reads: \n3  \"A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not \n4  know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the \n5  release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or \n6  her settlement with the debtor.\" \n7  66.  The Defendants, and all of their agents, attorneys and assigns, waive \nand release any and all claims or rights to pursue, initiate, prosecute, or commence \n8 \nany action or proceeding before any court, administrative agency or other tribunal, \n9 \nor to file any complaint regarding acts or omissions, by the Plaintiffs in any of the \n10 \ncases covered in this Settlement, by any Represented Individuals as defined \n11 \nherein, and by any Class Members, with respect to any matters related to the \n12 \nmatters alleged in the lawsuit complaint, including waiver of the right to file a \n13 \nmalicious prosecution action; and further, as it relates to this waiver or Release, \n14 \nexpressly waive the provisions of California Civil Code § 1542 recited in the \n15 \nprevious paragraph. \n16 \n67.  Plaintiffs have not relied upon the advice of Class Counsel as to the \n17 \nlegal and/or tax consequences of this settlement, the payment of any money by the \n18 \nDefendants or the distribution of the Settlement Funds. \n19 \n68.  Neither this Final Order of Approval, the Settlement Agreement, nor \n20 \nany of its terms or the negotiations or papers related thereto shall constitute \n21 \nevidence or an admission by any Defendant that any acts of wrongdoing have been \n22 \ncommitted, and they shall not be deemed to create any inference that there is any \n23 \nliability therefore. Neither this Final Order of Approval and Settlement, nor the \n24 \nSettlement Agreement, nor any of its terms or the negotiations or papers related \n25 \nthereto shall be offered or received in evidence or used for any purpose \n26 \nwhatsoever, in this or any other matter or proceeding in any court, administrative \n27 \nagency, arbitration, or other tribunal, other than as expressly set forth in the \n28 \nSettlement Agreement. \n16 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 76 of 98\n1  69.  Pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the \n2  Court fmds that there is no just reason for delay and therefore directs entry of this \n3  Final Order of Approval and Settlement. Inasmuch as this disposes of all claims \n4  asserted in the Lawsuit, the Court further directs the Clerk to enter an order of \n5  dismissal pursuant to F.R.Civ.P Rule 41 (a)(l)(2). \n6 \n7 \n8  DATED: _______  \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT \n9 \n10  JUDGE \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n17 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 77 of 98\n1  Exhibit 1  Opt Outs \n2  Exhibit 2  Injunctive Relief Agreement and Order Thereon \n3  Exhibit 3  Names of Minor Plaintiffs and Their Counsel and \n4  Categories \n5  Exhibit 4  Names Of Missing Represented Individuals, And \n6  Amounts Of Their Post-Fee Settlement \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n18 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 78 of 98\nEXHIBITD \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 79 of 98\nDRAFT STRUCTURAL RELIEF AGREEMENT \nThe parties to the above-captioned action have submitted a joint Order for the Court's \nreview and approval, addressing the injunctive relief class certified by the Court in its Order \nissued on January _, 2008.  The court has considered the joint submission and now issues the \nfollowing Order: \n1.  Basic Principles: \nAll persons have the right to march, demonstrate, protest, rally or perform other activities \nprotected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and the California \nConstitution.  The government may impose reasonable and narrowly tailored restrictions on the \ntime, place, and manner of conducting these activities.  However, any limitations or restrictions \nplaced on demonstrations or other First Amendment activities must be justified by the \nrequirements of maintaining public safety, public health, or safe access/egress from the area, and \nshould restrict no more speech than necessary to further these substantial government interests. \nOfficers must not be affected by the content of the opinions being expressed nor by the race, \ngender, linguistics, national origin, sexual orientation, physical disabilities, appearances, or \naffiliation of anyone exercising lawful rights. \n2.  Helicopters: \nLos Angeles Police Department (LAPD) helicopters assigned to monitor permitted crowd \ncontrol incidents shall operate the aircraft at reasonable altitudes so as to avoid disruption of First \nAmendment protected activities.  The Incident Commander will coordinate with event organizers \nto help avoid over flights during keynote speaker presentations.  This action is not intended to \nprevent LAPD helicopters from response to emergent situations requiring immediate police \npresence during such crowd control events. \n3.  Marches: \nDemonstrators, while participating in lawful assemblages, shall not be prevented from \nusing public sidewalks to join or exit a lawful march or from using any public sidewalk adjacent \nto a lawful march route.  However, while on the sidewalk, marchers will not be allowed to \nobstruct or unreasonably interfere with pedestrian movement and/or prevent lawfully open \nbusinesses from operating when such conduct violates any applicable law.  LAPD will consider \nthe practicality of facilitating demonstrations that may temporarily block traffic and LAPD shall \ninclude the subject in its Crowd Management training. \n4.  Motorcycles/Bicycles/Motor Vehicles: \nPolice motorcycles, bicycles, and motor vehicles may be used for the purpose of \nobservation, visible deterrence, traffic control, transportation and area control during a crowd \nevent.  When used at the back of a march, they should maintain a reasonably safe distance \nbehind the marchers.  LAPD personnel will not utilize motorcycles, bicycles, or motor vehicles \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 80 of 98\nto strike assembled demonstrators/marchers as a method for crowd control or crowd dispersal. \n5.  Crowd Management Training -Horses: \nIn its crowd management training, the LAPD shall include a subject on the impact of the \nuse of horses on crowd behavior. \n6.  Use of Less Lethal Weapons: \nLess-lethal munitions are categorized as projectiles launched or otherwise deployed for \nthe purpose of overcoming resistance, effecting arrest or addressing the threat of serious injury to \nan officer or suspect with less risk of causing death than the use of a fIrearm. \na.  Less-lethal munitions may be deployed on aggressive and/or combative \nsuspects in a crowd control situation, on suspects who are a potential physical \nthreat to themselves or others, or suspects displaying \"aggressive\" and/or \n\"combative\" actions. \nb.  For the purpose of deployment ofless-Iethal munitions, \"aggressive\" and/or \n\"combative\" actions include ongoing destruction of property that presents a \nthreat to the personal safety of officers or others. \nc.  Less lethal weapons should not be used on a lawfully dispersing crowd or \nindividual. \nd.  Less lethal weapons should not be used against a person or a crowd that is \nretreating unless the person or crowd continues to engage in unlawful activity \nthat is aggressive and/or combative. \ne.  Where feasible, notice should be given to the crowd before less-lethal weapons \nare deployed in a crowd control or dispersal situation, and where feasible, it \nshould be given in the language(s) spoken by those assembled. \nf.  If the LAPD resumes the use of stinger rounds, the LAPD will publish a notice \nthat will require that less-lethal stinger weapons can be used only with the \napproval of a staff officer (i.e., commander or above) and only in a riotous \nsituation where the use of lethal force would not be reasonable. \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 81 of 98\n7.  Use of Batons: \nBatons should not be used against members of the crowd attempting to disperse, persons \nunable to move because of the press of the crowd, or persons otherwise posing no imminent \nthreat to the officers or other persons.  Batons may be displayed or used in a pushing motion \nwhen used as a justified and authorized crowd management technique.  The baton may be used \nto push individuals who intentionally delay dispersal subsequent to a lawful order to disperse. \nWhen an individual's behavior is threatening or violent in nature, the baton may be used as an \nimpact device in accordance with Department policy. \n8.  Public Assemblies: \nThe Incident Commander and supervisors shall make every effort to ensure that the \npolice mission is accomplished as efficiently as possible, with the highest regard for human \ndignity and liberty of all persons, with consideration of the cultural and linguistic diversity of the \nneighborhoods and communities of Los Angeles, and with minimum reliance on the use of \nphysical force.  Incident Commanders, prior to declaring an assembly unlawful, will follow the \nprocedures as directed in the LAPD Guidelines for Crowd Management and Crowd Control, \nVolume 5 of the LAPD Emergency Operations Guide.  Before any public assembly is declared to \nbe unlawful, the Incident Commander should evaluate the feasibility of isolating and arresting \nthose responsible for the unlawful conduct, and if it is determined to be feasible, shall take such \naction. \n9.  Declaration of Unlawful Assembly: \nCrowd dispersal techniques shall not be initiated until after a declaration has been \nannounced as required by California Penal Code Section 409.  LAPD personnel will follow the \nprocedures as directed in the LAPD Guidelines for Crowd Management and Crowd Control, \nVolume 5 of the LAPD Emergency Operations Guide.  The following factors shall be considered \nwhen issuing a dispersal order: \na.  Use of an amplified loudspeaker system to issue the order \nb.  If feasible, send an officer to the far side of the crowd to tape record the order. \nc.  If circumstances permit (absence of serious violence), the order shall be made \nrepeatedly over a period of time and, if necessary, from a variety oflocations. \nd.  The order must include an objectively reasonable period of time to disperse \nand a clear and safe route to disperse based on the facts and circumstances \nknown at the time. \ne.  An order to disperse shall be given in a manner reasonably calculated to be \nheard by the entire crowd under the circumstances.  When it is known that \nmembers of the crowd do not understand English, an effort should be made, \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 82 of 98\nwhen feasible, to give the order to disperse in both English and the other \nlanguage(s). \nf.  The order to disperse shall include a warning that police action may include the \nuse of less lethal munitions, which could cause significant risk of serious injury \nto those who remain. \n10.  Crowd Management Training - Shows of Force \nIn its crowd management training, the LAPD shall include a subject on the impact of \nshows of force on crowd behavior. \n11.  LAPD's Policy Regarding Crowd Control: \nLAPD's policy regarding crowd control can be found in the Emergency Operations \nGuide, Volume 5, Chapter 7.  All LAPD directives and orders directly related to crowd control \nand the relevant portions of this agreement shall be included in the Emergency Operations Guide \nby July 1, 2009.  The plaintiffs shall be given an opportunity to provide input and comment on \nthe revisions prior to final approval by the LAPD. \n12.  Training on Crowd Control Policies: \nThe LAPD shall require Metropolitan Division to undergo training annually, and every \nofficer at the level of Sergeant I and above to undergo training at minimum intervals of two \nyears, on the Crowd Control and Use of Force policies to be developed pursuant to Paragraph 11 \nof this document.  The Department's existing training, designed and implemented after May 1, \n2007, will be reviewed and modified, as necessary, to conform to the policies developed as part \nof this agreement.  The training may be live or bye-module, or both, at the Department's \ndiscretion. \n13.  Retention of Jurisdiction: \nThe Court retains jurisdiction to enforce the terms of this judgment and to issue all orders \nnecessary to do so.  The Court's jurisdiction shall continue for a period of four years and may be \nextended-in whole or in part-for an additional period of two years upon proof by a \npreponderance of the evidence that the activities complained of are due to the Department's \nfailure to substantially comply with the provisions of this order. \nBefore bringing a motion to enforce this order, plaintiffs shall give defendants notice of \nan alleged violation and a reasonable opportunity to remedy it.  If necessary to permit defendants \nadequate time to remedy the alleged failure to comply, the parties will submit a joint request to \nextend the Court's initial period of jurisdiction. \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 83 of 98\nEXHIBITE \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 86      Filed 03/19/2009     Page 84 of 98\nMIWON AND RELATED CASE CLIENTS -ALPHABETICALLY BY LAST \nNAME \nFirst Name  Last Name  Attorney  Signed \n1.

INTRODUCTION \n2  This case is a class action on behalf of those whose First and Fourth \n3  Amendment rights were alleged to have been violated at the May 1, 2007, protest \n4  rally at MacArthur Park. The case was settled on terms spelled out in the \n5  Preliminary Approval Order and documents attached thereto, and those terms will \n6  not be repeated here. \n7  As a result of the lawsuit, a Consent Judgment will be entered embodying \n8  the terms of the settlement. Included in these terms is an order entered by the Court \n9  requiring certain guidelines and actions by the LAPD and the City of Los Angeles \nloin its future handling of rallies, demonstrations and marches. Thus, this case \n11  definitively altered practices that had been an issue within the LAPD for many \n12  years. \n13  This case settled for a total monetary award of$12,850,000, after extensive \n14  mediation efforts, to be divided among 297 individual class members represented \n15  individually by various MIWON or other counsel, and a residual class fund. From \n16  this, the Court was to be requested to award $3,455,000 plus $258,000 in medical \n17  liens and litigation costs, for a total of$3,713,000, to MIWON Counsel (as well as \n18  to approve the arrangement under which the non-MIWON counsel received \n19  approximately $500,000 in statutory fees negotiated between them and MIWON \n20  Counsel, as part of the division of the settlement.) \nPlaintiffs filed a motion for attorneys' fees seeking the foregoing agreed to \n21 \nfees and costs, based on both a class fund theory and a lodestar theory. For the \n22 \nreasons stated below, the Court awards Plaintiffs' counsel $3,713,000 in attorneys' \n23 \nfees and costs. \n24 \nDefendants did not object to, or challenge, Class Counsel's request for fees \n25 \nand costs. \n26 \n27 \n28 \n2 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 111      Filed 06/24/2009     Page 3 of 15\n1  II.  THE STANDARDS FOR AWARDING CLASS FUND ATTORNEYS' \nFEES. \n2 \nIt is well settled in the Ninth Circuit that, \"[i]n a common fund case, the \n3 \n4  district court has discretion to apply either the lodestar method or the percentage \nof-the-fund method in calculating a fee award.\" Fischel v. Equitable Life \n5 \n6  Assurance Soc'y a/the Us., 307 F.3d 997, 1006 (9th Cir.2002). \"Reasonableness \n7  is the goal.\" Id.  at 1007. \nThe Court will analyze the requested fees under both the percentage of the \n8 \nfund and the lodestar tests. \n9 \nTHE REQUESTED FEE IS REASONABLE UNDER THE \n10  III. \nPERCENTAGE OF THE FUND TEST. \n11 \nAlthough not mandated by the Ninth Circuit, courts often consider the \n12 \nfollowing factors when determining the benchmark percentage to be applied: (1) \n13  the result obtained for the class; (2) the effort expended by counsel; (3) counsel's \n14  experience; (4) counsel's skill; (5) the complexity of the issues; (6) the risks of \n15  non-payment assumed by counsel; (7) the reaction of the class; and (8) comparison \n16  with counsel's loadstar. See, e.g., In re Heritage Bond Litigation, 2005 WL \n17 \n1594403 at 18; In re Quintus Sec. Litig., 148 F.Supp.2d 967,973-74 \n18 \n(N.D.Cal.200 1). The Court will address each factor below. \n19 \nIn this case, the Court finds that most of the factors enunciated above exists \n20  in this case. \n21  A. \nTHE COMPLEXITY OF THE ISSUES, COUNSEL'S SKILL AND \n22  EXPERIENCE, AND THE EFFORT INVOLVED. \n23  Congress recognized the complexity of civil rights cases when the civil \n24  rights attorneys' fee statute (42 U.S.C. §1988) was passed in 1976. The legislative \n25  history states, \"It is intended that the amount of fees awarded under S. 2278 (42 \n26  U.S.C. § 1988) be governed by the same standards which prevail in other types of \n27  equally complex federal litigation, such as antitrust cases and not be reduced \n28 \n3 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 111      Filed 06/24/2009     Page 4 of 15\n1  because the rights involved may be nonpecuniary in nature.\" S.Rep.No. 94-1011, \n2  1976 U.S.Code Congo & Admin.News at 5913. \n3  While the legal issues in this case are not particularly novel, the factual \n4  issues were complex, and management of the process required a high level of skill \n5  and effort.  Because this was a hybrid individual and class case, Plaintiffs' counsel \n6  and their staffs represented nearly 300 individuals. Defendants insisted that, in \n7  order to settle the case, they needed independent verification (video, photos, third \n8  party witnesses, medical reports) for the vast majority of the Represented \n9  Individuals, even though the case was a class action. \n10  Counsel litigated this case aggressively. The work performed included: 1) \n11  extensive investigation of the underlying circumstances, including interviewing \n12  each of the approximately 300 Represented Individuals at length, and many \nwitnesses as well; 2) reviewing LAPD reports and investigations, as well as \n13 \nhundreds of hours of videos to locate photos of Represented Individuals; 3) \n14 \npreparation of the complaint; 4) the Rule 26 conference and report; 5) obtaining the \n15 \nmedical records for the Represented Individuals; 6) preparing mediation write-ups \n16 \nregarding the specifics of each Represented Individual, and then preparing a \n17 \nmediation package with photographic and video evidence to support each of the \n18 \n300 individual claims of presence in the park, and injury; 7) filing the class \n19 \ncertification motion and related papers; 8) engaging counsel for all the Represented \n20 \nIndividuals in a common process of valuing cases, after MIWON Counsel \n21 \nestablished and refined a system for assessing the cases, as a result of which all \n22 \ncounsel in all case agreed to the approach; 9) preparing lengthy mediation papers; \n23 \n10) attending six mediation sessions; 11) working out a series of individual \n24 \nproblem cases, with the participation of Class Counsel, the individual counsel \n25 \nrepresenting the client, and Judge Woehrle; and 12) preparing and negotiating the \n26 \nsettlement documents with the defendants. \n27 \n28 \n4 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 111      Filed 06/24/2009     Page 5 of 15\n1  Class Counsel have represented that the monetary terms of the settlement \n2  represent, to their knowledge, the largest total settlement in the country for a \n3  demonstration case, and the largest average per person damages recovery in any \n4  mass demonstration case to date. In addition, the settlement encompasses \n5  comprehensive structural relief. \n6  The appointed MIWON Class Counsel - Barry Litt, Carol Sobel and Paul \n7  Hoffman - are highly skilled civil rights and civil rights class action litigators. \n8  Each has outstanding reputations as exceptional civil right attorneys. \n9  B.  THERISKSOFNON-PAYMENTASSUMEDBYCOUNSEL \n10  While there may not have been a great risk of lack of proof of liability in the \n11  case, , there was substantial risk that the cost of litigating it could outstrip the \n12  damages in the case, particularly if the Class were not certified. Those risks \n13  included: 1) a potentially very difficult discovery process, requiring thousands of \n14  additional hours for the case; 2) a requirement (asserted by the City at the class \n15  certification hearing) that Plaintiffs prove lack of probable cause on an individual \n16  basis; 3) in the current economic climate, the risks of non or delayed payment are \n17  substantial (a form of which has occurred in that payment is delayed until sale of a \n18  judgment bond to fund the settlement). \nOther risks included class certification, settling the case expeditiously, \n19 \nmanaging the factual complexities of the case effectively, receiving an adequate \n20 \nfee award commensurate with the work involved, the disproportionate \n21 \nresponsibility of the MIWON counsel to carry the case. \n22 \nWhile risk is normally tied to the right to receive a multiplier above the \n23 \nordinary hourly rate to compensate for contingent risk, in this case, the opposite is \n24 \ntrue, i.e., counsel seek an award that actually represents a discount from lodestar, \n25 \nas is discussed in the lodestar section. \n26 \n27 \n28 \n5 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 111      Filed 06/24/2009     Page 6 of 15\n1  C.  THE RESULT OBTAINED FOR THE CLASS AND THE CLASS' REACTION. \n2  As discussed, this settlement represents the largest financial settlement of a \n3  demonstration case Class Counsel know of, with a residual class fund. In addition, \n4  in the past, the LAPD had privately agreed to changes, but had not implemented \n5  those agreements. The current settlement incorporates a Consent Judgment under \n6  which the City and the LAPD agree to a series of policies and procedures, as well \n7  as the continued jurisdiction of the Court to enforce the Consent Judgment as part \n8  of the Court's order approving the final settlement. \n9  There was only one objection to the settlement itself or to the award of \n10  attorney's fees, and there were no opt-outs. This is a highly favorable reaction by \n11  the class to the settlement. Compare, e.g., Hughes v.  Microsoft Corp., 2001 WL \n12  34089697,8 (W.D.Wash. 2001) (court found that the \"class members \n13  overwhelmingly support[ ed] the settlement\" where there were over 37,000 notices \n14  sent out, 2,745 class members participated in the settlement, \"only nine objections \n15  were submitted\", and there were 86 timely opt-outs and over 20 additional \n16  defective or untimely opt-outs;  \"these indicia of the approval of the class of the \n17  terms of the settlement support a finding of fairness under Rule 23 \"), citing Hanlon \n18  v.  Chrysler Corp.,  150 F.3d 1011, 1027 (9th Cir.1998) (despite vigorous objections \nand appeal by objectors, \"fact that the overwhelming majority of the class willingly \n19 \napproved the offer and stayed in the class presents at least some objective positive \n20 \ncommentary as to its fairness\"; court did not abuse its discretion in approving \n21 \nsettlement); Marshall v. Holiday Magic, Inc., 550 F.2d 1173, 1178 (9th Cir.1977) \n22 \n(approximately 1%   of 31 ,000 class members opted out; \"the fact that the \n23 \noverwhelming majority of the class willingly approved the offer and stayed in the \n24 \nclass presents at least some objective positive commentary as to its fairness\"). \n25 \nD.  THIRTY-ONE PERCENT Is A REASONABLE CLASS FUND AWARD IN \n26 \nTHIS CASE. \n27 \n28 \n6 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 111      Filed 06/24/2009     Page 7 of 15\n1  Where the percentage of the fund award is employed, the Ninth Circuit has \n2  \"established 25% of the common fund as the 'benchmark' award for attorney \n3  fees.\" E.g., Torrisi v.  Tucson Elec. Power Co.,  8 F.3d 1370, 1376 (9th Cir.1993). \n4  Although 25% is the benchmark, the Ninth Circuit has recognized that a variety of \n5  factors may lead to an upward adjustment of the percentage. E.g., In re Pac. Enter. \n6  Sec. Litig., 47 F.3d 373,379 (9th Cir.1995) (district court \"may adjust the \n7  benchmark when special circumstances indicate a higher or lower percentage \n8  would be indicated\"). The percentage amount can be adjusted upward or \n9  downward, or replaced by a lodestar calculation, to account for any unusual \n10  circumstances involved in the case, which, for example, would indicate that the \n11  percentage recovery would be either too small or too large in light of the hours \n12  devoted to the case. Six Mexican Workers v. Arizona Citrus Growers, 904 F.2d \n13  1301,1311 (9th Cir.1990). When making an adjustment, the district court should \n14  identify \"how it arrives at the figure ultimately awarded.\" Paul, Johnson, Alston & \n15  Hunt v.  Graulty, 886 F.2d 268,272 (9th Cir. 1989); see also Six Mexican Workers, \n16  supra. \n17  Nationally, the average percentage of the fund award in class actions is \n18  approximately one-third. The Federal Judicial Center published a report in 1996, \n19  entitled \"Empirical Study of Class Actions in Four Federal District Courts: Final \n20  Report to the Advisory Committee on Civil Rules\" (\"FJC Report\"). The study is \nbased on 407 class action lawsuits that either settled or went to verdict in the two \n21 \n22  year period from July 1, 1992, through June 30, 1994, in four federal district \n23  courts: the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia); the Southern District of \n24  Florida (Miami), the Northern District of Illinois (Chicago); and the Northern \n25  District of California (San Francisco). (FJC Report, pp. 3-4, 7-8.) The Empirical \nStudy found that \"the fee-recovery rate infrequently exceeded the traditional 33.3% \n26 \ncontingency fee rate. Median rates ranged from 27% to 30%. Most fee awards in \n27 \n28 \n7 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 111      Filed 06/24/2009     Page 8 of 15\n1  the study were between 20% and 40% of gross monetary settlement.\" (Id. at pp. \n2  68-69; citation and footnote omitted.). The Report concluded that \"attorneys' fees \n3  were generally in the traditional range of approximately one-third of the total \n4  settlement.\" (Id. at p. 90.) \n5  Another study, cited by Silber and Goodrich, Common Funds and Common \n6  Problems: Fee Objections and Class Counsel's Response, 17 RevLitig 525, 534 \n7  (1998), was done by National Economic Research Associates, an economics \n8  consulting firm, in 1994. It found that attorneys' fees in class actions averaged \n9  approximately 32% of the recovery, regardless of the case size, and averaged \n10  34.74% when the fees and expenses were added together. Silber and Goodrich, \n11  supra at 545-546. Silber and Goodrich conclude with the observation that a 33% \n12  fee award is both reasonable, and in line with the general market for contingent fee \n13  work. Id. at 546-549. This is the general percentage that they recommend. See also \n14  In re Rite Aid Corp. Securities Litigation, 396 F.3d 294,303 (3rd Cir. 2005), citing \n15  three studies (\" [0] ne study of securities class action settlements over $10 million ... \n16  found an average percentage fee recovery of 31 %; a second study by the Federal \n17  Judicial Center of all class actions resolved or settled over a four-year period ... \n18  found a median percentage recovery range of27-30%; and a third study of class \n19  action settlements between $100 million and $200 million ... found recoveries in \n20  the 25-30% range were 'fairly standard.\"') (citations omitted). \nIn this case, based on a fee of$3,955,000 (the requested MIWON statutory \n21 \nfees plus the non-MIWON statutory fees), Plaintiffs would receive, as a percentage \n22 \nof the fund, a 31 % award. This is well within the reasonable range of percentage of \n23 \n24  the fund awards, just at what most studies and commentators have characterized as \n25  the median nationally. \n26  The Ninth Circuit has recognized that many cases result in a higher \n27  percentage than the benchmark. See, e.g., Vizcaino v. Microsoft Corp., 290 F3d \n28 \n8 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 111      Filed 06/24/2009     Page 9 of 15\n1  1043 (9th Cir. 2002) (affirming a 28% award, resulting in a multiplier for \n2  Plaintiffs' counsel of3.65, based on 1) an exceptional result, 2) litigation risk, 3) \n3  benefits generated beyond the cash settlement, 4) the 28% figure was at or below \n4  market rate, and 5) the lengthy time period of the litigation and foregoing other \n5  work). Most, ifnot all of these factors are present here, but the biggest difference \n6  is that there is no multiplier above lodestar, but a discount, a factor favoring an \n7  upward adjustment. \n8  In addition, because there was a statutory attorney's fee available, it was an \n9  independent factor in the settlement negotiations and significantly increased the \n10  recovery. The settlement agreement,  states that \"Plaintiffs' potential claim for \n~24, \n11  statutory attorney's fees was a substantial factor in arriving upon the final \n12  settlement amount of$12,850,000\" and that \"the statutory attorney's fee claim \n13  materially and substantially increased the final settlement amount from what it \n14  otherwise would have been.\" In such a situation, and where the lodestar exceeds \n15  the benchmark percentage of the fund amount, it is appropriate to consider the \n16  lodestar in determining a reasonable upward adjustment of a percentage fee award. \n17  Various factors support this conclusion, including that 1) the amount requested was \nfactored in by Class Counsel in determining the reasonableness of the settlement; \n18 \n2) the MIWON Plaintiffs agreed to post-fee amounts, i.e., the amount they would \n19 \nactually receive, and the award requested here does not affect any of those \n20 \namounts; and 3) the MIWON Counsel- in contrast to the non-MIWON counsel-\n21 \n22  waived their right to any percentage of the recovery beyond what the Court \n23  awarded with any of their individual clients. \n24  IV.  THE REQUESTED FEE IS REASONABLE UNDER THE \nLODESTAR TEST. \n25 \nA.  LODESTAR STANDARDS. \n26 \nLodestar is defined generally as the number of hours reasonably expended \n27 \non the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate. Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 \n28 \n9 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 111      Filed 06/24/2009     Page 10 of 15\n1  U.S. 424, 433 (1983). Where a plaintiff has obtained excellent results, his or her \n2  attorney should recover a fully compensatory fee. See Hensley, supra, 461 U.S. at \n3  435. Full compensation normally encompasses all hours reasonably expended on \n4  the litigation. Id. \n5  In Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886,895, n.ll (1984), the United States \n6  Supreme Court explained that '''reasonable fees' ... are to be calculated according \n7  to the prevailing market rates in the relevant community.\" The Court should pay \n8  \"close attention\" to \"the fees charged by 'lawyers of reasonably comparable skill, \n9  experience and reputation.' \" Davis v.  City and County a/San Francisco, 976 F.2d \n10  1536, 1545-1546 (9th Cir. 1992). Subsequently, in City a/Riverside v. Rivera, 477 \n11  U.S. 561, 575-576 (1986), the Supreme Court elaborated that rates for civil rights \n12  litigation should be based on the market for complex federal litigation, citing \n13  Congress intent in enacting Section 1988 that it \"intended that the amount of fees \n14  awarded under [§1988] [sic] be governed by the same standards which prevail in \n15  other types of equally complex Federal litigation, such as antitrust cases.\" \n16  B.

The Court finds that the rates \n8  requested by the MIWON counsel are reasonable. \nC.  THE HOURS EXPENDED ARE REASONABLE \n9 \nWhile the hours expended by MIWON Counsel are substantial, they are not \n10 \nunexpected in light of the character of the case. MIWON Counsel represented \n11 \n12  nearly 200 individuals, and there was a total of 297 Represented Individuals, \nincluding those represented by non-MIWON counsel. MIWON counsel took the \n13 \nlead on all fronts of the case. \n14 \nMIWON Counsel assigned each attorney or law firm a group of clients for \n15 \n16  which they were responsible. The interaction with that client throughout the case, \n17   the documentation, client assessment, medical workups where needed, and written \n18  summary were the responsibility of that attorney. A handful of full client meetings \nwere held, in which all the MIWON clients and Counsel were invited to \n19 \nparticipate. In those meetings, there were presentations on general questions \n20 \napplicable to all clients (e.g., how a class action works, mediation plans, and the \n21 \nlike), discussions of the progress of the case and the Police Department \n22 \ninvestigation of complaints, with a time set at the end of each meeting for the \n23 \nlarger group of clients to break into the smaller assigned groups to meet with the \n24 \nindividual attorneys assigned to each group of clients. This was a reasonable means \n25 \nof communication with clients, and an effective means of investing them in the \n26 \n27 \n28 \n11 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 111      Filed 06/24/2009     Page 12 of 15\n1  case as a whole - a necessity for a case that, at best would take two to three years \n2  and, if it did not settle, far longer. \n3  MIWON Counsel worked with the non-MIWON counsel to agree to a \n4  common approach to settlement, reviewed the write-up for each non-MIWON \n5  Plaintiff, recommending changes, conforming its format, evaluating the individual \n6  rating and damages for that individual, and then meeting with each of the non \n7  MIWON counsel so as to ensure uniformity. This occurred with the non-MIWON \n8  counsel after the same process had been completed for the MIWON counsel. In \n9  addition, MIWON Counsel prepared all the pleadings and early discovery, all the \n10  negotiations with the City and Judge Woehrle (in some of which some of the non \n11  MIWON counsel participated), all of the negotiations to reach the structural relief \nagreement, and the vast majority of the review of the demonstration documentation \n12 \nto locate participants and respond in concrete form to the City's requirement that \n13 \nPlaintiffs provide some form of verification of their presence in MacArthur Park at \n14 \nthe date and time of the police action .. \n15 \nIn order to ensure uniformity of each case assessment - essential if a \n16 \nsettlement were to be reached - MIWON Counsel established a committee of \n17 \nseveral MIWON Counsel responsible to evaluate every case uniformly - both \n18 \nthose represented by MIWON and non-MIWON counsel. They developed a \n19 \nuniform scoring system; reviewed each Plaintiff, hislher facts, documentation and \n20 \nmedical records; and scored the Plaintiff. \n21 \nMIWON counsel met with the non-MIWON counsel primarily responsible \n22 \nfor the particular client, and used the same methodology used for the MIWON \n23 \nclients to come to an agreement about the valuation of their clients' claims. They \n24 \nreviewed all the documents for the non-MIWON as well as the MIWON clients. \n25 \nFurther, MIWON Counsel participated directly in meeting with reluctant clients of \n26 \nother counsel - generally in conjunction with Judge Woehrle - to work out ways of \n27 \n28 \n12 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 111      Filed 06/24/2009     Page 13 of 15\n1  resolving this issue so that it would not stymie the settlement process. Dozens of \n2  hours were spent by MIWON Counsel in just this effort. \n3  All settlement documents were prepared by MIWON Counsel and the City. \n4  It was generally acknowledged by all counsel that the MIWON Counsel \n5  were the driving force in resolving the settlement. MIWON Counsel ultimately \n6  negotiated with each set of non-MIWON attorneys the recovery, including \n7  statutory fees, that would be assigned each attorney and hislher clients. \n8  Analyzed on a per client basis, with approximately 300 clients - since the \n9  MIWON Counsel were effectively co-representing the non-MIWON clients - and \n10  9600 hours, it means that 32 hours were expended per client. The mean recovery \n11  was over $25,000. Attorney's fees of $4,000,000 prorated (including the statutory \n12  fees paid to non-MIWON counsel) prorated among 297 clients comes to slightly \n13  more than $13,000 per client. This is reasonable for a case that involved litigation, \n14  informal discovery, extensive mediation, and a class process. \n15  Accordingly, the Court finds that the hours expended in this case were \n16  reasonable. The Court also notes that the actual hours being compensated, based on \n17  the approved hourly rates, amounts to a 13%-14% discount from lodestar (the \n18  difference between a $4,000,000 lodestar based on the approved rates and hours \n19  and factoring in a modest amount of further work) and the $3,455,000 requested as \n20  MIWON fees. \n21  Accordingly, whether using the lodestar or the percentage of the fund \n22  method, the fee requested is reasonable. \n23  V.  ALLOCATION OF LIEN REDUCTIONS. \nThe Court has been advised that MIWON counsel has successfully \n24 \nnegotiated some liens and expects to reduce the size of the MIWON liens \n25 \nsomewhere between $50,000 and $100,000. These lien funds are part of the total \n26 \n$3,753,000 requested by MWION counsel. MIWON counsel have further advised \n27 \n28 \n13 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 111      Filed 06/24/2009     Page 14 of 15\n1  the Court that, under their arrangements with their clients, each client is to receive \n2  a specified amount, and counsel assumed responsibility for the liens. The Court has \n3  also been advised by MIWON counsel that, probably as a result of the larger than \n4  expected Unrepresented Class Member claims, there is a bill of$30,617.80 to \n5  cover the Class Administrator's billing to date, and the Class Administrator \n6  estimates an additional $11,315 and possibly more to complete the claims \n7  administration (excluding particular efforts that may be requested by the City at its \n8  expense). This bill is greater than had originally been expected. Originally, \n9  $50,000 in class administrative costs was anticipated, including payment of \n10  $20,000 to Plaintiff organizations for outreach to Unrepresented Class Members. \n11  Based on the currently anticipated Class Administrator bills, the costs of class \n12  administration will be approximately $12,000 more than anticipated. \n13  In light of the fact that the amount to be paid to MIWQN counsel is less than \n14  their lodestar, the Court approves that any sums saved by the reduction of liens \n15  shall be deemed fees to the MIWON counsel. However, from that reduction, \n16  MIWON counsel shall pay the additional class administrative costs so that the \nfunds available for distribution to Unrepresented Class Members remains \n17 \n$200,000. \n18 \n19  VI.  THE REQUESTED COSTS ARE REASONABLE. \nPlaintiffs seek an award of$258,000 in costs, most of which are for med· \n20 \nft.-.IWOtJ \nliens yet to be paid. To the extent they are not, MIVvTOUN Counsel submitted an \n21 \nitemization of costs, which the Court finds reasonable. Accordingly, those costs are \n22 \nawarded as well. \n23 \n24 \nDATED: \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n14 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 111      Filed 06/24/2009     Page 15 of 15\n1 \n2 \nSubmitted by: \n3  LITT, ESTUAR, HARRISON & KITSON, LLP \n4  LAW   OFFICES OF CAROL SOBEL \n5 \n6 \n7  By:  lsi  Barrett S.

The court has considered the \n4  joint submission and now issues the following Order: \n5  1.  Basic Principles: \n6  All persons have the right to march, demonstrate, protest, rally or perform \n7  other activities protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution \n8  and the California Constitution.  The government may impose reasonable and \n9  narrowly tailored restrictions on the time, place, and manner of conducting these \n10  activities.  However, any limitations or restrictions placed on demonstrations or \n11  other First Amendment activities must be justified by the requirements of \n12  maintaining public safety, public health, or safe access/egress from the area, and \nshould restrict no more speech than necessary to further these substantial \n13 \ngovernment interests.  Officers must not be affected by the content of the opinions \n14 \nbeing expressed nor by the race, gender, linguistics, national origin, sexual \n15 \norientation, physical disabilities, appearances, or affiliation of anyone exercising \n16 \nlawful rights. \n17 \n2.  Helicopters: \n18 \nLos Angeles Police Department (LAPD) helicopters assigned to monitor \n19 \npermitted crowd control incidents shall operate the aircraft at reasonable altitudes \n20 \nso as to avoid disruption of First Amendment protected activities.  The Incident \n21 \nCommander will coordinate with event organizers to help avoid over flights during \n22 \nkeynote speaker presentations.  This action is not intended to prevent LAPD \n23 \nhelicopters from response to emergency situations requiring immediate police \n24 \npresence during such crowd control events. \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n2 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 112      Filed 06/24/2009     Page 3 of 7\nCa  2:07 -cv-03072-AHM-FFM  Document 109  Filed 06/23/2009  Page 3 of 7 \n1  3.  Marches: \n2  Demonstrators, while participating in lawful assemblages, shall not be \n3  prevented from using public sidewalks to join or exit a lawful march or from using \n4  any public sidewalk adjacent to a lawful march route.  However, while on the \n5  sidewalk, marchers will not be allowed to obstruct or unreasonably interfere with \n6  pedestrian movement and/or prevent lawfully open businesses from operating \n7  when such conduct violates any applicable law.

Less-lethal munitions may be deployed on aggressive and/or \n25 \ncombative suspects in a crowd control situation, on suspects who \n26 \n27 \n28 \n3 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 112      Filed 06/24/2009     Page 4 of 7\nCa  2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM  Document 109  Filed 06/23/2009  Page 4 of 7 \n1  are a potential physical threat to themselves or others, or suspects \n2  displaying \"aggressive\" and/or \"combative\" actions. \n3  b.  For the purpose of deployment ofless-Iethal munitions, \n4  \"aggressive\" and/or \"combative\" actions include ongoing \n5  destruction of property that presents a threat to the personal safety \n6  of officers or others. \n7  c.  Less lethal weapons should not be used on a lawfully dispersing \n8  crowd or individual. \n9  d.  Less lethal weapons should not be used against a person or a crowd \n10  that is retreating unless the person or crowd continues to engage in \n11  unlawful activity that is aggressive and/or combative. \n12  e.  Where feasible, notice should be given to the crowd before less \nlethal weapons are deployed in a crowd control or dispersal \n13 \nsituation, and where feasible, it should be given in the language(s) \n14 \nspoken by those assembled. \n15 \nf.  If the LAPD resumes the use of stinger rounds, the LAPD will \n16 \npublish a notice that will require that less-lethal stinger weapons \n17 \ncan be used only with the approval of a staff officer (i.e., \n18 \ncommander or above) and only in a riotous situation where the use \n19 \nof lethal force would not be reasonable. \n20 \n7.  Use of Batons: \n21 \nBatons should not be used against members of the crowd attempting to \n22 \ndisperse, persons unable to move because of the press of the crowd, or persons \n23 \notherwise posing no imminent threat to the officers or other persons.  Batons may \n24 \nbe displayed or used in a pushing motion when used as a justified and authorized \n25 \ncrowd management technique.  The baton may be used to push individuals who \n26 \nintentionally delay dispersal subsequent to a lawful order to disperse.  When an \n27 \n28 \n4 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 112      Filed 06/24/2009     Page 5 of 7\nCa  2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM  Document 109  Filed 06/23/2009  Page 5 of 7 \n1  individual's behavior is threatening or violent in nature, the baton may be used as \n2  an impact device in accordance with Department policy. \n3  8.  Public Assemblies: \n4  The Incident Commander and supervisors shall make every effort to ensure \n5  that the police mission is accomplished as efficiently as possible, with the highest \n6  regard for human dignity and liberty of all persons, with consideration of the \n7  cultural and linguistic diversity of the neighborhoods and communities of Los \n8  Angeles, and with minimum reliance on the use of physical force.  Incident \n9  Commanders, prior to declaring an assembly unlawful, will follow the procedures \nas directed in the LAPD Guidelines for Crowd Management and Crowd Control, \n10 \n11  Volume 5 of the LAPD Emergency Operations Guide.  Before any public assembly \nis declared to be unlawful, the Incident Commander should evaluate the feasibility \n12 \nof isolating and arresting those responsible for the unlawful conduct, and if it is \n13 \ndetermined to be feasible, shall take such action. \n14 \n9.  Declaration of Unlawful Assembly: \n15 \nCrowd dispersal techniques shall not be initiated until after a declaration has \n16 \nbeen announced as required by California Penal Code Section 409.  LAPD \n17 \npersonnel will follow the procedures as directed in the LAPD Guidelines for \n18 \nCrowd Management and Crowd Control, Volume 5 of the LAPD Emergency \n19 \nOperations Guide.  The following factors shall be considered when issuing a \n20 \ndispersal order: \n21 \na.  Use of an amplified loudspeaker system to issue the order. \n22 \nb. If feasible, send an officer to the far side of the crowd to tape record \n23 \nthe order. \n24 \nc.  If circumstances permit (absence of serious violence), the order \n25 \nshall be made repeatedly over a period of time and, if necessary, \n26 \nfrom a variety of locations. \n27 \n28 \n5 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 112      Filed 06/24/2009     Page 6 of 7\nCa  2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM  Document 109  Filed 06/23/2009  Page 6 of 7 \n1  d.  The order must include an objectively reasonable period of time to \n2  disperse and a clear and safe route to disperse based on the facts \n3  and circumstances known at the time. \n4  e.  An order to disperse shall be given in a manner reasonably \n5  calculated to be heard by the entire crowd under the circumstances. \n6  When it is known that members of the crowd do not understand \n7  English, an effort should be made, when feasible, to give the order \n8  to disperse in both English and the other language(s). \n9  f.  The order to disperse shall include a warning that police action may \n10  include the use of less lethal munitions, which could cause \n11  significant risk of serious injury to those who remain. \n12  10.  Crowd Management Training - Shows of Force \n13  In its crowd management training, the LAPD shall include a subject on the \n14  impact of shows of force on crowd behavior. \n15  11.

The plaintiffs shall \n19 \n20  be given an opportunity to provide input and comment on the revisions prior to \n21  final approval by the LAPD. \n12.  Training on Crowd Control Policies: \n22 \nThe LAPD shall require Metropolitan Division to undergo training annually, \n23 \nand every officer at the level of Sergeant I and above to undergo training at \n24 \n25  minimum intervals of two years, on the Crowd Control and Use of Force policies \n26  to be developed pursuant to Paragraph 11 of this document.  The Department's \n27  existing training, designed and implemented after May 1,2007, will be reviewed \n28 \n6 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 112      Filed 06/24/2009     Page 7 of 7\nCa  2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM  Document 109  Filed 06/23/2009  Page 7 of 7 \n1  and modified, as necessary, to confonn to the policies developed as part of this \n2  agreement.  The training may be live or bye-module, or both, at the Department's \n3  discretion. \n4  13.  Retention of Jurisdiction: \n5  The Court retains jurisdiction to enforce the tenns of this judgment and to \n6  issue all orders necessary to do so.  The Court's jurisdiction shall continue for a \n7  period of four years and may be extended-in whole or in part-for an additional \n8  period of two years upon proof by a preponderance of the evidence that the \n9  activities complained of are due to the Department's failure to substantially comply \n10  with the provisions of this order. \n11  Before bringing a motion to enforce this order, plaintiffs shall give \n12  defendants notice of an alleged violation and a reasonable opportunity to remedy it. \n13  If necessary to pennit defendants adequate time to remedy the alleged failure to \n14  comply, the parties will submit a joint request to extend the Court's initial period \n15  of jurisdiction. \nTJUDGE \n18 \n19 \nSubmitted by: \n20 \nLITT, ESTUAR, HARRISON & KITSON, LLP \n21 \nLAW OFFICES OF CAROL SOBEL \n22 \n23 \n24  By:  /s/  Barrett S.

The force used against plaintiffs, if any, was caused and necessitated by the\n15 actions of plaintiffs, and was reasonable and necessary for the defense of others.\n115. The state claims are ban-ed for plaintiffs' failure to comply with the\n16\n17 provisions of the California Tort Claims Act, Government Code § 910 et seq.\n18 116.

HOWARD MATZ, U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE \nStephen Montes  Not Reported \nDeputy Clerk  Court Reporter / Recorder  Tape No. \nAttorneys NOT Present for Plaintiffs:  Attorneys NOT Present for Defendants: \nProceedings:  IN CHAMBERS (No Proceedings Held) \nThe Court, having considered the memoranda, declarations and exhibits filed by \nPlaintiffs and Defendants in support of and in opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for Class \nCertification, and having heard oral argument by both parties on October 29,2007, \ngrants the motion for the reasons fully elaborated in the Court's civil minutes dated \nDecember 14,2007.  A true and correct copy of the Court's civil minutes is attached as \nExhibit 1 and incorporated herein by this reference.  This order specifically makes the \nfindings required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23. \n1.  The Court makes the following findings pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a), \nupon which the Court elaborates in detail at pages 14-17 of Exhibit 1: \na.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; the \nLAPD's own estimate of the size of the May 1, 2007, march is over 6000 \npeople. \nb.  There are questions of law or fact common to the class, which include the \nLAPD's command decisions to declare an unlawful assembly, disperse the \ncrowd, and authorize the use of force. \nc.  The claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims \nor defenses of the class; all the proposed representative parties claim to have \nbeen driven from the park or immediately surrounding areas and to have \nCV-90 (06/04) \nCIVIL MINUTES -GENERAL \nPage 1 ofS \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 41      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 2 of 31\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \n~:~'  /D~t¢:::' \nCV 07-3072 ARM (FMOx)  January 8, 2007 \n:fr\"K~ \nMULTI-ETHNIC IMMIGRANT WORKERS ORGANIZING NETWORK, et al. v. \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES, et al. \nsuffered injury as a result, in violation of both their First Amendment and \nFourth Amendment rights. \nd.  The representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of \nthe class. \ni. The Court appoints Kevin Breslin, David Gabriel Eng, Luis Galvez, \nGerardo Gomez, Jaime Maldonado, Leopoldo Ortiz, Romualdo Pedro, and \nJeremy Rothe-Kushel as class representatives. \nii. The Court appoints Barrett Litt, Carol Sobel and Paul Hoffman as lead \nclass counsel, who will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the \nclass.  The Court finds that those counsel have all of the characteristics \nidentified in Fed. R. Civ. P.  23(b)(g)(1)(A), to wit, a) they have identified \nand investigated the potential claims in the action, b) they have extensive \nexperience in handling class actions and other complex litigation, \nparticularly in the civil rights area, c) they are knowledgeable regarding the \napplicable law, and d) they have committed the resources necessary to \nrepresenting the class.  The Court considers these counsel best able to \nrepresent the interests of the class. \nc.  Those attorneys who filed actions on behalf of other clients who agree to be \nmembers of the damages class may serve on a steering committee. \n2.  The Court finds, pursuant to the requirement of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), \nthat, based upon Plaintiffs' allegations, defendants, who are the party opposing the class, \nhave acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final \ninjunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as \na whole.  The actions alleged that qualify as acting or refusing to act include declaration \nof an unlawful assembly and dispersal of the crowd, and failure to adopt and/or \nimplement policies to prevent the infringement of the rights of demonstrators. \n3.  The Court further finds that injunctive relief to secure the rights of \ndemonstrators in the future by holding the LAPD accountable for failing to comply with \npolicies and practices that it previously promised to implement is the primary goal of the \nCV-90 (06/04)  CIVIL MINUTES -GENERAL  Page 2 of5 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 41      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 3 of 31\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \n....... ~~ CV 07-3072 ARM (FMOx) \nMULTI-ETHNIC IMMIGRANT WORKERS ORGANIZING NETWORK, et al. v . \n.., ;·];f:~;jir~*i.. _  C. :::.I:..:T~Y.....:O::::F:......::.LO.:::..:..S .:.:A~N:...:G=E=L=E.:..:S,:...:e:.:..ta =l..:..... _________________  \nlitigation.  Because injunctive relief predominates, certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(b )(2) is permissible despite Plaintiffs' additional claims for monetary damages. \n4.  The Court further finds that manageability considerations do not justify \ndenial ofa Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) class. \n5.  The Court certifies a class pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), which class \nis defined as follows: \n\"Those who in the past have engaged in or who in the future may engage in \npeaceful demonstrations or protest in the City of Los Angeles and who, at the time they \nengage in such peaceful demonstrations or protest, were or are: \n(a) The following organizations: Multi-Ethnic Immigrant Workers Organizing \nNetwork, Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, Koreatown \nImmigrant Workers Alliance, Institute for Popular Education of Southern California, \nPilipino Workers Center, Garment Workers Center (\"Plaintiff Associations\"); \n(b) Officers, representatives, or members of Plaintiff Associations; \n( c) Persons who attend or participate in Plaintiff Associations' events, including \nbut not limited to their rallies; \n(d) Organizations that advocate, organize, or both advocate and organize on behalf \nof the rights of individuals and associations to engage in speech, assembly, and \nexpression within the scope of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution; \nand \n( e) Persons who participate in public assemblies organized by the organizations \ndescribed in paragraph (d). \n6.  The Court also finds, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), that the questions \nof law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only \nindividual members.

The Court's conclusions in this regard \nare set out in further detail at pages 19-22 of Exhibit 1. \n7.  The Court also finds, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), that a class action \nis superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the \ncontroversy.  The Court's conclusions in this regard are set out in further detail at pages \n19-22 of Exhibit 1.  Below, each additional factor listed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) is \ndiscussed: \na.  There are approximately 300 individual claims filed from among the over \n6000 class members, and over half of those appear to be represented by the \nMIWON counsel. Thus, the interests of class members in individually \ncontrolling separate actions and the extent and nature of litigation already \ncommenced, do not lead to the conclusion that class treatment is \ninappropriate. \nb.  The desirability of concentrating the action weighs in favor of class \ncertification since all claims arise from a common core of facts. \nc.  The Court finds that the class is manageable.  Many tools are available to \nmanage the class, including bifurcating liability and damages, appointing a \nmagistrate judge or special master to preside over damages proceedings, and \ncreating subclasses as permitted under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4). \nd.  In addition, the Court notes that certification of demonstration classes is \nwell established in the law, and is consistent with the primary policy goal of \nthe class action mechanism -- to enable the collective vindication of the \nrights of numerous persons whose claims are not worth litigating in \nindividual actions. \nCV-90 (06/04) \nCIVIL MINUTES -GENERAL  Page 4 of5 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 41      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 5 of 31\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \n:;, .' ..' .

The Court defers notice to the class at this time.  Notice is not generally \nrequired for a class certified under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  See Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23 (c)(2)(A).  Notice is required for classes certified under Fed. R. Civ.

INTRODUCTION \nThis is one of several civil rights actions arising from the Los Angeles Police \nDepartment's (\"LAPD\") forceful dispersal of the May 1,2007 immigration rally at \nMacArthur Park.  It is, of course, not surprising that such a momentous clash would \nspawn litigation, but because that event was so highly publicized, it has also triggered \nextensive commentary.  The Court will not add to others' reflections about what May \nDay 2007 says about the City of Los Angeles.  In this order the Court will only rule on \nthe Plaintiffs' motion for class certification.  For the following reasons, the Court \nGRANTS that motion. 1 \nII.  BACKGROUND \nThe LAPD recently issued a detailed report containing a minute-by-minute account \nof the events of May Day 2007 (\"LAPD Report,,).2  It is largely consistent with the \nfactual allegations in the F AC.  The events were also extensively captured on video.

MULTI-ETHNIC IMMIGRANT WORKERS ORGANIZING NETWORK, et al. v. \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES, et al. \nOn May 1, 2007, an association of five non-profit organizations comprising \nPlaintiff Multi-Ethnic Immigrant Workers Organizing Network (\"MIWON\") conducted a \nmarch and rally, as they had done previously on \"May Day\" for several years.  FAC ~ 50. \nThe permitted events consisted of a morning march and rally in downtown Los Angeles3 \nand a final rally at MacArthur Park.  LAPD Report at 7.  The MacArthur Park rally was \npermitted to continue until 9:00 p.m.  FAC ~ 6.  By 5:00 p.m, an estimated 6,000 to 7,000 \npeople were present in or around MacArthur Park.  LAPD Report at 7.  A number of \nevents created tensions among demonstrators and police.4  In the immediately \nprecipitating incident, a group of20 or 30 \"anarchist kids\" began throwing objects at the \npolice, including water bottles and gravel.  LAPD Report at 8,32-33. \nAs officers in the field radioed in reports that they were \"taking rocks and bottles\" \nand that unruly elements were inciting the crowd, two groups of supervising officers \ndiscussed plans to disperse the crowd.  LAPD Report at 33-34.  Despite some \nmiscommunication along the chain of command, the discussions resulted in \"a decision to \ndeclare an unlawful assembly and disperse the crowd.\"  LAPD Report at 8.  \"[The] plan \ninvolved the use of Metropolitan Division [an elite LAPD unit] resources to move the \ncrowd from the south side of the park northbound from 7th and Alvarado toward the \nnorth side of the park.\"  Id.  The LAPD commanders also gave authorization to use \"less \nlethal\" munitions if the behavior of the crowd warranted it.  Id. at 34-35. \n\"At 6: 17 p.m., the Metropolitan Division B-Platoon formed a skirmish line, and \nwithout a dispersal order being given, moved the crowd northbound, pushing and striking \nsome individuals in the crowd, including some members of the media, and firing less \nlethal munitions.\"  Id. at 8; FAC ~ 7. A few minutes later, a police helicopter broadcast a \npartial dispersal order:  \"This is the Los Angeles Police Department. (Inaudible) ... This \nis now an unlawful assembly.  Everybody needs to leave the park immediately.\"  LAPD \nReport at 38.  This order was broadcast in English and was inaudible to many in the park, \nincluding certain LAPD commanders, who in the next ten minutes sought confirmation \nthat an order had been given.  See LAPD Report at 40; FAC ~ 7.  By 6:41 p.m., when the \n3The LAPD Report states that the morning events took place in \"Central Area,\" which is an \nLAPD designation for downtown Los Angeles.  MacArthur Park is in the \"Rampart Area.\" \n4For example, at one of the entrances to the park, the police formed a skirmish line to direct the \ncrowd into a particular entrance, thereby raising tensions with the crowd.

A group of \nattorneys from over a dozen law firms (\"MIWON counsel\") jointly represent the named \nplaintiffs as well as a large number of unnamed plaintiffs, totaling over 180 people. \nPlaintiffs seek appointment of the twelve named individual plaintiffs as class \nrepresentatives and appointment of MIWON counsel as class counsel. \nThe First Amended Complaint (\"F AC\") contains seven claims seeking relief for \nviolations of various rights: \n1.

MULTI-ETHNIC IMMIGRANT WORKERS ORGANIZING NETWORK, et al. v. \n.);~~  CITY OF LOS ANGELES, et at. \nPlaintiffs initially moved to certify the following two classes under Rule 23(b )(2) \nand 23(b) (3): \n(1) An injunctive class defined as \"all persons who in the past, or may in the future, \nengage in peaceful demonstrations or protest in the City of Los Angeles.\" \n(2) A damages class defined as \"those persons who were present on May 1, 2007 in \nor around MacArthur Park at any point between the hours of 5:00 and 7:00 p.m., who did \nnot engage in any conduct justifying Defendants' dispersal order or the use of force, and \nwho were subjected to the LAPD's use of force, dispersal order or other unlawful police \nactivity in MacArthur Park, or along Wilshire Boulevard, Alvarado Boulevard, 7th Street \nor Park View Street, or in the vicinity of those streets.\" \nAt a hearing conducted on October 29,2007, the Court pointed out various \nproblems with the proposed class definitions.  Those problems related primarily to \nwhether the proposed class representatives had standing to pursue the injunctive class and \nwhether the proposed damages class was sufficiently discrete and manageable to warrant \ncertification.  Following the hearing, Plaintiffs modified their proposals and now they \npropose these classes: \n(1) An injunctive class defined as:  \"Those who in the past have engaged in or who \nin the future may engage in peaceful demonstrations or protest in the City of Los Angeles \nand who, at the time they engage in such peaceful demonstrations or protest, were or are: \n(a) The following organizations: Multi-Ethnic Immigrant Workers \nOrganizing Network, Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, \nKoreatown Immigrant Workers Alliance, Institute for Popular Education of Southern \nCalifornia, Pilipino Workers Center, Garment Workers Center (\"Plaintiff Associations\"); \n(b) Officers, representatives, or members of Plaintiff Associations; \n( c) Persons who attend or participate in Plaintiff Associations' events, \nincluding but not limited to their rallies; \n(d) Organizations who advocate and/or organize on behalf of the rights of \nindividuals and associations to engage in speech, assembly, and expression \nwithin the scope of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.\" \n(2) A damages class defined as:  \"Those persons who were present on May 1,2007 \nCV-90 (06/04)  CIVIL MINUTES -GENERAL  Page4of25 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 41      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 11 of 31\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \n~-;-:-u~-:-~-~-~_i_~-sH_~-N-~~:-:-~-~~:e-~-a-r-~-o-~~-R-S~O-R-G-A-N-IZ-I~N~~~2007 \nin the geographic area bounded by 6th Street (on the north), Alvarado Street (on the east), \n7th Street (on the south), and Park View Street (on the west), or the immediately adjacent \nareas, including along 6th Street to Lafayette Park, at any point between the hours of 5:00 \nand 7:00 p.m., who did not engage in any conduct justifying Defendants' dispersal order \nor the use of force, and who were subjected to the LAPD' s use of force, dispersal order or \nother unlawful police activity arising from the police response to the immigration march \nand rally.\" \nIII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nThe party seeking class certification bears the burden of establishing that each of \nthe four requirements of Rule 23(a) and at least one requirement of Rule 23(b) have been \nmet.  Dukes v.  Wal-Mart, Inc., --- F.3d ---, 2007 WL 4303055 *4 (9th Cir., Dec. 11, \n2007) (citing Zinser v. Accufix Research Institute, Inc., 253 F.3d 1180, 1186 (9th Cir. \n2001), amended, 273 F.3d 1266 (9th Cir. 2001)).  A district court may certify a class only \nif, after \"rigorous analysis,\" it determines that the party seeking certification has met its \nburden.  General Telephone Co. o/the Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 158-161 \n(1982).  However, in determining whether plaintiffs have carried their burden, the court \nmay not consider the merits of their claims.  See Dukes, 2007 WL 4303055 at *4.  Rather, \nin reviewing a motion for class certification, the Court generally is bound to take the \nsubstantive allegations of the complaint as true.  In re Coordinated Pretrial Proceedings \nin Petroleum Products Antitrust Litig., 691 F.2d 1335, 1342 (9th Cir. 1982) (citing \nBlackie v. Barrack, 524 F.2d 891,901 (9th Cir. 1975)).  Nevertheless, the Court may look \nbeyond the pleadings to determine whether the requirements of Rule 23 have been met. \nHanon v. Dataproducts Corp., 976 F.2d 497,509 (9th Cir. 1992) (citation omitted).  In \nfact, \"courts are not only at liberty to but must consider evidence which goes to the \nrequirements of Rule 23 [at the class certification stage] even [if] the evidence may also \nrelate to the underlying merits of the case.\"  Dukes, 2007 WL 4303055 at *4 (internal \nquotations and citation omitted).  Ultimately, it is within the district court's broad \ndiscretion to determine whether a class should be certified.

DISCUSSION \nA.  Standing \nA party cannot be a proper representative of a class if such party lacks standing \nindividually to pursue the claims of the class.  Hawkins v.  Comparet-Cassani, 251 F .3d \n1230, 1238 (9th Cir. 2001). \nTo have Article III standing to seek injunctive relief on behalf of a class, a named \nplaintiff must have suffered harm constituting \"actual injury.\"  Armstrong v. Davis, 275 \nF.3d 849, 860-61 (9th Cir. 200 I) (internal citations omitted) (citing 0 'Shea v. Littleton, \n414 U.S. 488, 494 (1974), Lewis v.  Casey, 518 U.S. 343,348-49 (1996), and City ofL os \nAngeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 109 (1983».  There is no dispute that the individual \nPlaintiffs have alleged actual and direct injury - being driven out of a public park and \nsurrounding areas, as well as physical injury.  Each Plaintiff has alleged that he (or she) \nwas present at MacArthur Park as a demonstrator, observer of the rally, or recreational \nuser of the park at the time of the forceful dispersal, and that he (or she) suffered physical \ninjury due to the LAPD's use of force.  FAC ~~ 40,56-67. \nBut a class representative plaintiff also \"must demonstrate 'that he is realistically \nthreatened by a repetition of [the violation].'\"  Armstrong, 275 F.3d at 860-61 (quoting \nLyons, 461 U.S. at 109).  Defendants argue that Plaintiffs do not face a real and \nimmediate threat of being prevented by the LAPD from participating in a lawful and \npeaceful demonstration in the future. \nNine of the twelve individual Plaintiffs have submitted declarations making it clear \nthat they frequent MacArthur Park and other public areas, whether for demonstrations or \nrecreation, and intend to do so in the future.  See Reply Ex. B (Declarations of Breslin, \nCuellar, Eng, Galvez, Gomez, Maldonaldo, Ortiz, Pedro and Rothe-Kushel).  Breslin, \nGomez, Galvez, and Ortiz submitted supplemental declarations after the hearing \nindicating that they also attended the May Day 2006 rally.  PIs.' Supp. Mem. Exs. A-D. \nDefendants do not dispute that those Plaintiffs who have submitted supporting \ndeclarations are likely to attend demonstrations in the future.  They argue only that the \nLAPD's behavior will not occur again. \nIII \nCV -90 (06/04)  CIVIL MINUTES -GENERAL  Page 6 of25 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 41      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 13 of 31\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES -GENERAL \ni \nCV 07-3072 AHM (FMOx)  December 14  2007 \n,,<:\\<  ' \nMULTI-ETHNIC IMMIGRANT WORKERS ORGANIZING NETWORK, et al. v. \n..  CITY OF LOS ANGELES, et al. \nOne way to meet the \"realistic repetition\" requirement is to \"demonstrate that the \nharm is part of a 'pattern of officially sanctioned ... behavior, violative of the plaintiffs' \n[ federal] rights. '\"  Armstrong, 275 F.3d at 961 (quoting LaDuke v. Nelson, 762 F .2d \n1318, 1323 (9th Cir. 1985)).  As the Ninth Circuit elaborated, \"where the defendants have \nrepeatedly engaged in the injurious acts in the past, there is a sufficient possibility that \nthey will engage in them in the near future to satisfy the 'realistic repetition' \nrequirement.\"  Armstrong, 275 F.3d at 961; see also Thomas v.  County ofL os Angeles, \n978 F.2d 504, 507 (9th Cir. 1992) (noting that the \"possibility of recurring injury ceases \nto be speculative when actual repeated incidents are documented.\") (citation omitted). \nThe LAPD has issued unlawful dispersal orders and displayed excessive force \norders against demonstrators in the past.  Some of the incidents are documented in \nlawsuits, such as the Los Angeles Superior Court cases Marmillion v. City ofL os Angeles \n(BC 059778), arising out of a large demonstration in October 1991; and Vassos v.  City of \nLos Angeles (BC 080155) and Shejik v.  City ofL os Angeles (BC 080092), arising from \nmass arrests of protesters in 1992.  Declaration of Carol A. Sobel in Support of Plaintiffs' \nSupplemental Memorandum (\"Sobel Supp. Decl.\"),-r,-r 2,4.  Vassos and Shejik ended in a \ncombined settlement agreement in 1995, involving monetary payment as well as LAPD \npolicy changes and training requirements.  Id. ,-r,-r 5-6 & Ex. C.  Notably, that settlement \nincluded provisions defining an unlawful assembly, distinguishing an unlawful assembly \nfrom unlawful conduct by isolated individuals, and setting forth requirements for \ndispersal orders.  Id., Ex. C, ,-r,-r 10, 12, 14. \nAt the Democratic National Convention in 2000, the LAPD declared an unlawful \nassembly in the public demonstration area, ordered the crowd to disperse, and used \nrubber bullets, batons and other forms of physical force as the crowd attempted to \ndisperse.  That melee led to three federal lawsuits in this District:  National Lawyers \nGuild v.  City ofL  os Angeles (CV 01-6877) (\"NLG\"), Berg v. City ofL os Angeles  (CV \n01-7046), and Crespo v.  City ofL os Angeles (CV 00-8869).  The NLG and Crespo cases \nended in settlements that set forth standards for the LAPD in regards to unlawful \nassemblies, dispersal orders, and treatment of the media.  See Mem. Ex. 37 (Settlement \nagreement in NLG) (\"NLG Settlement\"); LAPD Report, Appendix A, p. 85 (summary of \nstandards from NLG and Crespo settlement agreements). \nIII \nCV-90 (06/04)  CIVIL MINUTES -GENERAL  Page 70f25 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 41      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 14 of 31\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \nCase~~.  CV 07-3072 ARM (FMOx)  Date  December 14, 2007 \nMULTI-ETHNIC IMMIGRANT WORKERS ORGANIZING NETWORK, et al. v. \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES, et al. \nThe Court in NLG found that plaintiffs had established sufficient likelihood of \nrepetition to have Article III standing to seek equitable relief, citing numerous \ndemonstrations at which the LAPD allegedly acted unlawfully.  Sobel Supp. Decl., Ex. E \n(Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment \nat 12-13 (CV 01-6877, Dec. 3,2003)). \nThe LAPD itself has acknowledged that what happened on May Day 2007 was not \nan isolated incident:  \"Chief Bratton was concerned that the Department had identified \nmany of these problems in the past and that the lessons learned had been forgotten.\" \nLAPD Report at 74.  The LAPD Report also acknowledges that the treatment of the \nmedia at May Day 2007 failed to comply with the NLG and Crespo settlement \nagreements.  LAPD Report at 10, 11,48.  The Report further identified a number of \nreasons for the repetition on May Day 2007 of the kind of police misconduct that \noccurred at the Democratic National Convention some seven years earlier.  For example, \nit noted: \"Over the past several years, there appears to have been a gradual diminution of \nan arrest posture during organized crowd control situations. The Department has moved \nfrom a posture of isolating and arresting those who are engaging in unlawful activity or \ndisrupting a rally or demonstration, to a posture of declaring an unlawful assembly and \nclearing the entire area.\"  Id. at 52.  The report also faulted the scaling back of training in \ncrowd control and treatment of the media, suggesting it was \"non-required\" training that \nwas \"not a priority,\" given other demands on LAPD resources.  Id. at 63-64. \nIn short, May Day 2007 was not an isolated event caused by unusual or isolated \nfactors. \nThe injunction that Plaintiffs now seek generally mirrors the standards set forth in \nthe NLG Settlement and incorporates the principles from the Vassos-Shejik settlement. \nSee Mem. Ex. 37; Sobel Supp. Decl., Ex. C.  Indeed, the LAPD Report explicitly \nrecognizes that standards in the NLG and Crespo settlements apply.  LAPD Report \nAppendix 1 (Summary of the measures that the LAPD agreed to enact as part of the \nsettlements resulting from the 2000 Democratic National Convention).  However, those \nsettlements were private agreements, not consent decrees or court injunctions.  Moreover, \nsome of the settlement language was permissive, lacking the precision and force of a \nlegal decree.  For example, the NLG Settlement provided that the LAPD may use less \nlethal weapons under certain circumstances, rather than that the LAPD is prohibited from \nusing those weapons except under certain circumstances.

Resp. to PIs.' Supp. Mem. at 2.  Defendants cite \nto the LAPD Report's description of the Incident Management and Training Bureau, \nestablished in July 2007, the institution of Department-wide training in crowd control and \nFirst Amendment issues, and several examples of successful LAPD management of mass \ndemonstrations since May 2007.  Id., Hillman Decl. ~~ 1-8.  Defendants also emphasize \nthat historically there have been more events and rallies with no LAPD misconduct than \nthose with problems, pointing to May Day 2006 as an example of a very similar \ndemonstration that was successful.  Id. ~ 9. \nDefendants' showing is insufficient to deny Plaintiffs standing to seek injunctive \nrelief.  In the past, the LAPD has undertaken efforts to revise its policies and train LAPD \nofficers to ensure proper management of demonstrations, albeit those efforts were not as \nextensive as the post-May Day 2007 efforts are touted to be.  See Sobel Supp. Decl. ~ 6 & \nEx. C ~~ 7-17 (policies and training changes as part of the Vassos-Shefik settlement). \nAlthough steps were taken in the immediate aftermath of previous litigation, nevertheless \nnew instances of misconduct occurred.  The Court cannot find that the measures the \nLAPD took after May 2007 have achieved, in a mere six months, the reforms that \nplaintiffs in previous cases sought for over a decade. \nDefendants' contention that their overall record of complying with constitutional \nrequirements relating to crowd control is more positive than negative is similarly \nunpersuasive.  Defendants suggest that Plaintiffs lack standing because the LAPD's \nrecord with regards to May Day immigration rallies is \"1 and 1\" - i.e., as successful in \n2006 as it was unsuccessful in 2007.  Def. Resp. at 3.  This argument actually hurts \nDefendants: if the odds of an alleged constitutional violation recurring were 50 percent, a \nsufficient case or controversy would be present. \nIII \nIII \nCV-90 (06/04)  CIVIL MINUTES -GENERAL  Page 9 of25 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 41      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 16 of 31\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \n';;!::'\" \nCV 07-3072 ARM (FMOx)  .~.  December 14, 2007 \nMULTI-ETHNIC IMMIGRANT WORKERS ORGANIZING NETWORK, et al. v . \n. '<\"; CITY OF LOS ANGELES, et al. \nIn any event, to establish a case or controversy Plaintiffs need not establish that \nfuture harm is certain, or even probable.  What they must establish is that recurrence is \nnot \"conjectural\" or \"hypothetical,\" as it would be if future injury were contingent on \nmultiple unlikely assumptions.  See Lyons, 461 U.S. at 105-08 (threat of future injury not \nsufficiently real and immediate to establish existing controversy where the claim of future \ninjury rested on assumption that plaintiffs would engage in conduct leading to an \nencounter with police involving the use of a chokehold).  Given Plaintiffs' declarations, \nthe contents of the LAPD Report and the unfortunate history of civil rights violations by \nLAPD officers,5 it is clear that here the threat of future injury is not merely conjectural or \nhypothetical.  Although the Court applauds the LAPD's remedial actions since May Day \n2007, the Court finds that the individual Plaintiffs are \"realistically threatened by a \nrepetition of [the violation.]\"  Lyons at 109. \nThis conclusion is consistent with Lyons and Ninth Circuit precedent.  In Hodgers \nDurgin v. De La Vina, a case which Defendant cites, the Ninth Circuit distinguished \nLyons on the ground that in Lyons, the police chokehold that was the alleged injury \noccurred during a traffic stop prompted by Lyons's misconduct.  199 F.3d 1037, 1041-42 \n(9th Cir. 1999) (en bane) (stating that the Supreme Court in Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. \n1, 15 (1998) \"characterized the denial of Article III standing in Lyons as having been \nbased on the plaintiffs ability to avoid engaging in illegal conduct.\"). The plaintiffs in \nHodgers-Durgin had standing to challenge the Border Patrol's practice of stopping \nmotorists without reasonable suspicion because driving vehicles near the Mexican border \nis innocent conduct and therefore they had no duty to avoid another stop by the Border \nPatrol.  Id. at 1041.  Moreover, there was \"no string of contingencies necessary to \nproduce an injury.\"  Id. at 1042-43.  This case is like Hodgers-Durgin and not like Lyons \nfor the same reasons.  Plaintiffs claim that they were engaged in innocent conduct when \nthey were unjustifiably driven from MacArthur Park and surrounding areas.  Like the \nplaintiffs in Hodgers-Durgin, they are neither able to nor required to prevent the \npossibility of that injury being repeated. \n5See Report ofthe Independent Commission on the Los Angeles Police Department (1991) (the \n\"Christopher Commission Report\"); Consent Decree, United States v.

Rather, \"a class will be \nfound to exist if the description of the class is definite enough so that it is \nadministratively feasible for the court to ascertain whether an individual is a member.\" \nO'Connor v. Boeing N. Am., Inc., 184 F.R.D. 311, 319 (C.D. Cal. 1998) (citing Aiken v. \nObledo, 442 F.Supp. 628,658 (E.D.

Damages class definition. \n\"Those persons who were present on May 1, 2007 in the geographic area bounded by 6th \nStreet (on the north), Alvarado Street (on the east), 7th Street (on the south), and Park \nView Street (on the west), or the immediately adjacent areas, including from 6th Street \nwest to Lafayette Park, at any point between the hours of 5:00 and 7:00 p.m., who did not \nengage in any conduct justifying Defendants' dispersal order or the use of force, and who \nwere subj ected to the LAPD' s use of force, dispersal order or other unlawful police \nactivity arising from the police response to the immigration march and rally.\" \n2. Injunctive class definition. \n\"Those who in the past have engaged in or who in the future may engage in peaceful \ndemonstrations or protest in the City of Los Angeles and who, at the time they engage in \nsuch peaceful demonstrations or protest, were or are: \n(a) The following organizations: Multi-Ethnic Immigrant Workers Organizing \nNetwork, Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, Koreatown Immigrant \nWorkers Alliance, Institute for Popular Education of Southern California, Pilipino \nWorkers Center, Garment Workers Center (\"Plaintiff Associations\"); \nCV-90 (06/04)  CIVIL MINUTES -GENERAL  Page 11 of25 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 41      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 18 of 31\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \n\"  . v':/>';~;;))'<'/:\\/ :;,::<,.>:>';i-'.,\\  ~:ft·'< \nCV 07-3072 ARM (FMOx)  :Uatcr:;;  December 14, 2007 \nMULTI-ETHNIC IMMIGRANT WORKERS ORGANIZING NETWORK, et al. v. \n..

They also contend that the terms \n\"peaceful\" and \"demonstration\" are not defined.  Finally, they argue that class \nmembership cannot be objectively determined, because it would tum on each potential \nclass member's state of mind.  Not so. \nAs a general matter, less precision is required of class definitions under Rule \n23(b )(2) than under Rule 23(b) (3), where mandatory notice is required by due process. \nSee Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U.S. 797, 812 (holding that notice of right to \nopt-out of suit for money damages is required by the Due Process Clause); Yaffe v. \nPowers, 454 F.2d 1362, 1366 (1st Cir. 1972) (stating that in contrast to certification of a \nsubdivision (b )(3) class, \"notice to the members of a (b )(2) class is not required and the \nactual membership of the class need not therefore be precisely delimited.\"). \nManageability is not as important a concern for injunctive classes as for damages classes. \nSee Elliott v.  Weinberger, 564 F.2d 1219, 1229 (9th Cir. 1977) (\"by its terms, Rule 23 \nmakes manageability an issue important only in determining the propriety of certifying an \naction as a (b )(3), not a (b )(2), class action.\"), aff'd in pertinent part sub nom, Califano v. \nYamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 701 (1979). \nDefendants' objection to the lack of a temporal limit lacks merit.  Indeed, the very \nnature of an injunctive class contemplates that there will be class members who can only \nbe determined in the future.  See Probe, 780 F.2d at 780; see also Carpenter v. Davis, \n424 F.2d 257,260 (1st Cir. 1970) (approving injunctive class consisting of all who wish \nor expect to write for, publish, sell or distribute the newspaper in the future and \nemphasizing that \"[t]he record is ample to show numerous such people in existence, as \nwell as the probability of others who may become members of the class in the future.\"). \nCV-90 (06/04)  CIVIL MINUTES -GENERAL  Page 12 of25 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 41      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 19 of 31\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \n;';\"E:0'; \n.  CV 07-3072 ARM (FMOx)  ~B~te:'\" December 14, 2007 \nMULTI-ETHNIC IMMIGRANT WORKERS ORGANIZING NETWORK., et al. v. \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES, et al. \nAny temporal limit on the injunctive class in this case would be arbitrary. \nAlthough class definitions should avoid criteria that are subjective, the words \n\"peaceful\" and \"demonstration\" are objectively determinable descriptors of class \nmembers' behavior.  Other courts have certified a class defined with similar language. \nSee, e.g., Washington Mobilization Committee v.  Cullinane, 400 F.Supp. 186,218 \n(D.D.C. 1975), rev'd in part on other grounds, 566 F.2d 107 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (certifying \nclass of \"all persons who have participated in or observed and who intend to participate \nin or observe lawful, peaceful, orderly and non-obstructive public demonstrations for the \nexercise of their Constitutional rights of free speech and assembly\"); Medrano v. Allee, \n1972 WL 714, *3 (S.D. Tex. Dec. 4,1972), vac'd in part on other grounds, Allee v. \nMedrano, 416 U.S. 802 (1974). \nThis case is distinguishable from cases in which the class definition depended on \nthe states of mind of class members or defendants, such as Vietnam Veterans Against the \nWar v. Beinecke.  63 F.R.D. 675, 679-80 (W.D. Mo. 1974).  There, like here, plaintiffs \nalleged that the police deprived them of their right to assemble peacefully when their \nprotest march was cut short.  Id. at 677.  The proposed class definition encompassed \n\"persons who attend or participate or who wish to attend or participate in any public \nassembly or demonstration in Kansas City, Missouri held by citizens groups or \norganizations whose political or social views conflict with those of the officials in the \ngovernment or the Kansas City, Missouri Police Department.\"  Id. at 678.  This \ndefinition, the court held, was insufficient for determining membership in the class, \nbecause it was \"based upon such a general and indefinite state of mind, encompassing a \nkaleidoscopic variety of mental positions ....\"   Id. at 680.  Similarly, in Koen v. Long, a \nclass consisting of people belonging to organizations \"that are unpopular with \ndefendants, and who participate in activities which are \"controversial and unpopular with \ndefendants\" was found to depend on the state of mind of defendants, and therefore \ninadequate.  302 F.Supp. 1383, 1387-89 (E.D. Mo. 1969), afJ'd 428 F.2d 876 (8th Cir. \n1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 923 (1971). \nUnlike those cases, membership in the injunctive class proposed here does not \ndepend on the beliefs or state of mind of any individuals.  Rather, membership is based \non the putative class members' conduct, activities, and affiliations.  These criteria are \nreadily susceptible to judicial determination.  See Alliance to End Repression v. American \nCivil Liberties Union, 565 F.2d 975, 978 (7th Cir. 1977) (holding that the injunctive class \nCV-90 (06/04)  CIVIL MINUTES -GENERAL  Page 13 of25 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 41      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 20 of 31\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \n_C_V_O_7_-3_0_72__AH_ M_( .;...F_M_O_x~) __________ D,,~te  December 14,2007 \nMULTI-ETHNIC IMMIGRANT WORKERS ORGANIZING NETWORK, et al. v. \nl'~!  CITY OF LOS ANGELES, et at. \nwas adequately defined because its scope is defined by the activities of the defendants \nwith no particular state of mind required). \nC.  Rule 23(a) Requirements \n1. Numerosity \nRule 23(a)(l) requires that the class be \"so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpracticable.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(l).  Dukes, 2007 WL 4303055 at *4.  The damages \nand injunctive classes indisputably meet this requirement. \nBased on the LAPD's estimates of tumo ut, Plaintiffs logically estimate the \ndamages class to include over 6,000 people.6  As the LAPD Report confirmed, only a \nvery few people were disobedient or disorderly (or attacked the police), and therefore \npotentially ineligible.  Given these estimates, the damages class meets the numerosity \nrequirement. \nDefendants' objection to Plaintiffs' vague estimate of the size of the injunctive \nclass is not well taken.  Rule 23 does not require a numeric estimate of the number of \nclass members, if certification under Rule 23(b )(2) is sought.  See Advisory Committee \nNotes, 39 F.R.D. 69, 102 (\"Illustrative [of23(b)(2)] are various actions in the civil-rights \nfield where a party is charged with discriminating unlawfully against a class, usually one \nwhose members are incapable ofs pecific enumeration.\") (emphasis added). \n2. Commonality \nRule 23(a)(2) requires that \"there are questions of law or fact common to the \nclass.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2).  \"Rule 23(a)(2) has been construed permissively.  All \nquestions of fact and law need not be common to satisfy the rule. The existence of shared \nlegal issues with divergent factual predicates is sufficient, as is a common core of salient \nfacts coupled with disparate legal remedies within the class.\"  Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., \n150 F.3d 1011, 1019 (9th Cir. 1998). \n6The LAPD Report estimates that 6,000 to 7,000 were present in MacArthur Park at 5:00 p.m. \nThe damages class is comprised ofthose present in the park or immediately adjacent areas between 5:00 \nand 7:00 p.m. \nCV-90 (06/04)  CIVIL MINUTES -GENERAL  Page 14 of25 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 41      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 21 of 31\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES -GENERAL \n,  CV 07-3072 ARM (FMOx)  ~t;Date; December 14,2007 \n~}~;,'  ;4;'---------:....---~---------....; .  . ,An3.[',--------:~--\n;i \n~tjtle  MULTI-ETHNIC IMMIGRANT WORKERS ORGANIZING NETWORK, et al. v. \n;<'T;k\\?~t!!~;;i;  CITY OF LOS ANGELES, et al. \nThe LAPD's command decisions to declare an unlawful assembly, disperse the \ncrowd, and authorize the use of force constitute the \"common core of salient facts\" that \nsupport commonality.  See FAC ~~ 77, 78 (listing common questions of law and fact). \nDefendants do not challenge any of these commonalities.  Accordingly, the Court finds \nthat there are sufficient shared factual and legal issues to satisfy Rule 23(a)(2). \n3. Typicality \nRule 23(a)(3) requires that \"the claims or defenses of the representative parties are \ntypical of the claims or defenses of the class.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3).  The typicality \nrequirement \"is designed to assure that the named representative's interests are aligned \nwith those of the class.\" Jordan v.  County olLos Angeles, 669 F.2d 1311, 1321 (9th Cir.), \nvacated and remanded on other grounds, 459 U.S. 860 (1982).  Where such an alignment \nexists, a representative who vigorously pursues her own interests will necessarily advance \nthe interests of the class.  Id.  The Ninth Circuit interprets the typicality requirement \npermissively.  Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1020.  Named plaintiffs' claims need not be identical \nto the claims of the class; rather, their claims are typical if they are \"reasonably co \nextensive with those of absent class members.\"  Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1020.  \"As long as \nthe named representative's claim arises from the same event, practice, or course of \nconduct that forms the basis of the class claims, and is based upon the same legal theory, \nvarying factual differences between the claims or defenses of the class and the class \nrepresentative will not render the named representative's claim atypical.\"  Jordan, 669 \nF.2d at 1321. \nAll of the proposed representatives claim they were driven from the park, all claim \nphysical injury and some claim to have had physical contact with the police.  Defendants \nnevertheless argue that typicality is lacking because the May Day incident gave rise to \ndifferent rights, injuries, and claims, depending on whether one was a participant, legal \nobserver, or bystander, whether one heard the dispersal order, whether one had physical \ncontact with the police, and whether one suffered physical injury.  Plaintiffs correctly \nrespond that one's status as participant, observer or bystander does not defeat typicality \nas to their First Amendment claim, because that claim alleges that everyone had a First \nAmendment right to be in the park.  Similarly, one's right to be free from excessive force \ndoes not depend on whether one was participating in the protest.  Nor do differences in \nphysical contact and injury defeat typicality as to the Fourth Amendment claim, because \nCV-90 (06/04)  CIVIL MINUTES -GENERAL  Page 15 of25 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 41      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 22 of 31\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \n..•; ~;:  CV 07-3072 ARM (FMOx)  kilate'  December 14,2007 \n,  c,'~,·,  ~t'::'S-<fB1/\\:<;~>'. _ __  ___. :.....-__ \n:titt'!&!ii;S;{;;;i; \nMULTI-ETHNIC IMMIGRANT WORKERS ORGANIZING NETWORK, et al. v. \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES, et al. \nthey are permissible variations within a class.  See Vodak v.  City of Chicago, 2006 WL \n1037151 at *6 (N.D. Ill. 2006) (similar variations in arrest and detention within large \ngroup of protesters did not defeat typicality).  As the Ninth Circuit noted in Hanlon, \n\"[u]nder the rule's permissive standards, representative claims are 'typical' if they are \nreasonably coextensive with those of absent class members; they need not be \nsubstantially identical.\"  150 F.3d at 1020.  Under these standards, the proposed \nrepresentatives' claims are typical. \n4. Adequacy of representation \nThe adequacy requirement of Rule 23(a) is that the \"representative parties will \nfairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  This \nfactor requires: (1) that the proposed representative Plaintiffs do not have conflicts of \ninterest with the proposed classes, and (2) that Plaintiffs are represented by qualified and \ncompetent counsel who will prosecute the action vigorously on behalf of the class. \nDukes, 2007 WL 4303055 at *11 (citations omitted).  The declarations of Plaintiffs and \ntheir counsel satisfy these requirements.  Defendants' only argument regarding adequacy \nis that the class representatives lack standing to seek an injunction.  The Court rejected \nthat argument, above. \n(a) Class representatives. \nPlaintiffs request that the twelve individually named plaintiffs be appointed class \nrepresentatives.  The Court will appoint as class representatives only those named \nplaintiffs who have filed declarations attesting to their understanding of their obligations \nas class representatives.  They are:  Kevin Breslin, David Gabriel Eng, Luis Galvez, \nGerardo Gomez, Jaime Maldonado, Leopoldo Ortiz, Romualdo Pedro, and Jeremy Rothe \nKushel.7 \n7Each of these eight individuals has submitted a second declaration with the Reply \nin support of their standing to represent an injunctive class.  Four of these individuals, \nBreslin, Gomez, Galvez, and Ortiz, submitted a third declaration after the hearing in \nsupport of their standing. \nCV-90 (06/04)  CIVIL MINUTES -GENERAL  Page 16 of25 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 41      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 23 of 31\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \n::S!:~~O'l  ~i;J;),aie \nCV 07-3072 ARM (FMOx)  December 14,2007 \nTitle  ...

Those attorneys who filed actions on behalf of other clients who agree to be \nmembers of the damages class may serve on a steering committee. \nD.  Rule 23(b )(2) Requirements \nCertification under Rule 23(b )(2) is appropriate where the opposing party \"has \nacted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making \nappropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the \nclass as a whole.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  Originally designed for civil rights cases, \nRule 23(b )(2) class actions are limited to those class actions seeking primarily injunctive \nor corresponding relief.  Newberg on Class Actions, § 4.11 (4th ed. 2002). \nOther courts have certified Rule 23(b )(2) classes in cases involving police action \nagainst demonstrators.  See Chang v.  United States, 217 F.R.D. 262, 264, 267 (D.D.C. \n2003) (certifying a class of persons arrested en masse during an anti-World Bank/IMF \nprotest in September 2002 in Washington D.C.); Washington Mobilization Committee v. \nCullinane, 400 F. Supp. 186,219 n. 2 (D. D.C. 1975); Sullivan v. Murphy, 478 F.2d 938, \n967 (D.C. Cir. 1973) (noting class treatment was appropriate, despite the highly \nindividualized nature of probable cause, because it was \"a situation in which the police \ndid not govern themselves by their ordinary procedures ...A  nd the arrests that were made \nwere the product of a common course of conduct by the police.\"); Sullivan v. Murphy, \n380 F.Supp 867, 868 (D.D.C. 1974).8 \n8Defendants cited one mass demonstration case in which Rule 23(b )(2) certification \nwas denied, but on the ground that the class definition was inadequate (because it \ndepended on the \"state of mind\" of class members and defendants).

Act or refusal to act. \nThe mere fact that the LAPD declared an unlawful assembly and dispersed the \ncrowd at MacArthur Park is enough to meet the requirement that defendants acted on \ngrounds generally applicable to the class.  Moreover, Plaintiffs have alleged (and at this \nstage the Court must accept as true) that the LAPD has failed to adopt and/or implement \npolicies to prevent the infringement of the rights of demonstrators.  See FAC ~~ 28-39. \nThat Defendants have \"acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the \nclass\" is patently obvious based on the LAPD Report and the allegations at the heart of \nthis lawsuit. \n2. Impact of money damages on injunctive class certification. \nThe Ninth Circuit recently reiterated that Rule 23(b )(2) class actions can include \nclaims for monetary damages, so long as such damages are not the \"predominant\" relief \nsought, but instead are \"secondary to the primary claim for injunctive or declaratory \nrelief.\"  Dukes, 2007 WL 4303055 at *11 (internal quotations and citations omitted). \nMoreover, \"the predominance test turns on the primary goal of the litigation--not the \ntheoretical or possible size of the damage award.\"  ld. at *13. \nPlaintiffs seek compensatory and special damages, damages pursuant to California \nCivil Code § 52, and exemplary damages \"in an amount sufficient to deter and to make \nan example of [] defendants.\"  FA  C ~~ 118-120.  The Court should not and will not \nspeculate as to the possible size of the damage award.  \"Focusing predominantly on the \nplaintiffs' intent in bringing the suit,\" it is clear that injunctive relief predominates in this \ncase.  ld. at 1234.  Plaintiffs' prayer for injunctive relief and the declarations supporting \nthis motion plainly demonstrate that the primary goal of the litigation is to secure the \nrights of demonstrators in the future, i. e. by holding the LAPD accountable for failing to \ncomply with policies and practices that it promised to implement pursuant to prior \nsettlement agreements.

Manageability considerations. \nDefendants raise vague concerns about manageability in connection with the \npotential size of the injunctive class.  Manageability considerations do not justify denial \nof certification of a Rule 23(b)(2) class.  See Elliott, 564 F.2d at 1229 (\"The [defendant] \ndoes not cite, nor can we find, any authority which supports his rather novel theory \nlimiting (b)(2) class actions because of their numerosity and manageability problems.  By \nits terms, Rule 23 makes manageability an issue important only in determining the \npropriety of certifying an action as a (b )(3), not a (b )(2), class action.\"). \nE.  Rule 23(b )(3) Requirements \nThe key questions under this analysis are: (1) whether common issues predominate \nover questions affecting only individual members and (2) whether the putative class \naction is superior to other methods for fair and efficient adjudication of the issues.  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  \"Subdivision (b)(3) encompasses those cases in which a class action \nwould achieve economies of time, effort, and expense, and promote uniformity of \ndecision as to persons similarly situated, without sacrificing procedural fairness or \nbringing about other undesirable results.\"  Advisory Committee Notes, 39 F.R.D. 69, \n102-103. \n1. Rule 23(b)(3) factor one: Predominance. \n\"When common questions present a significant aspect of the case and they can be \nresolved for all members of the class in a single adjudication, there is clear justification \nfor handling the dispute on a representative rather than on an individual basis.\"  Hanlon, \n150 F.3d at 1022.  When one or more of the central issues in the action are common to \nthe class, the action may be considered proper under Rule 23(b )(3) even though other \nimportant matters will have to be tried separately, such as damages or some affirmative \ndefenses peculiar to some individual class members.  See Local Joint Executive Bd. of \nCulinary/Bartender Trust Fund v. Las Vegas Sands, Inc., 244 F.3d 1152, 1163 (9th Cir. \n2001) (holding that Rule 23(b)(3) predominance requirement was satisfied where all \nliability issues in employment case were the same and the only individualized issues \nrelated to the calculation of damages); Gunnells v. Healthplan Servs., Inc., 348 F.3d 417, \n428 (4th Cir.), cert. denied 124 S.Ct. 2837 (2003) (stating that because Rule 23(b)(3) \nactions usually require individual proof of damages, courts usually find predominance \nCV-90 (06/04)  CIVIL MINUTES -GENERAL  Page 19 of25 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 41      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 26 of 31\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \n;~~~N;:!{  CV 07-3072 ARM (FMOx)  ID ate  December 14, 2007 \n,;:fiL  ------------.;----------\n~k'! \n':~~t ~~T 6:r~~~~~k~~~i WORKERS ORGANIZING NETWORK, et al. v. \nrequirement satisfied if common questions predominate over individual questions as to \nliability). \nAs discussed below, the common issues in the First Amendment claim, Fourth \nAmendment claim, Monell claim, and respondeat superior liability are more than \nsufficient to meet the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3).  Because the record \nthus far is insufficiently developed as to the alleged Fourteenth Amendment violations, \nthe Court declines at this time to include those claims among those the class may pursue. \n(a) First Claim for Relief:  First Amendment, § 1983 claim. \nAs to the First Amendment claim, Plaintiffs are correct that the only material fact is \nthat the LAPD decided to declare an unlawful assembly and disperse the crowd.  Even \nthe LAPD Report states that the First Amendment rights of peaceful individuals and \nmembers of media were curtailed.  LAPD Report at 51-52.  However, an individual \nquestion exists as to whether each class member, such as a random passerby, actually was \nengaged in protected First Amendment activity. \nFrom a practical point of view, common questions predominate, largely because \nmost of those present were engaged in protected activity.  See LAPD Report at 4, 51, 52. \nGiven the intangible nature of First Amendment rights and values, it makes sense to \nassess damages on this claim on the basis of criteria applicable to the class as a whole, \nsuch as the degree to which the police action curtailed the planned events.  The court or \njury could then determine the total compensation appropriate for that loss or the \nreasonable award for each victim.  See, e.g., Dellurns, 566 F.2d at 174 (jury awarded \nuniform compensatory damages per class member for violations of First Amendment \nrights). \n(b) Third, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Claims for Relief:  Fourth \nAmendment and related state claims for excessive force.9 \nIII \n9Counse1 for Defendants acknowledged at the hearing that the Fourth Amendment claim will be \nsimilar to the state law claims for most putative class members. \nCV-90 (06/04)  CIVIL MINUTES -GENERAL  Page 20 of25 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 41      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 27 of 31\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \n.~CV_O_7_-3_0_72_A_H_M_(~F_M_O_x~)  ~J?~t~;ii!._ \n__________  D_e_c_em_be_r_1-.4,_2_00_7_ \nMULTI-ETHNIC IMMIGRANT WORKERS ORGANIZING NETWORK, et al. v. \n; CITY OF LOS ANGELES, et al. \nThe Fourth Amendment prohibits the use of unreasonable force in effecting a \nsearch or seizure of a suspect.  The LAPD use or threat of force against the assembled \ncrowd may constitute a seizure,1O although there are individual factual questions as to \nwhether a given officer caused a particular individual to be displaced by the use or threat \nof force.  The parties focus their arguments not on whether there was a seizure, but on \nwhether the actions of the police officers were reasonable.  Thus, Plaintiffs focus on the \nLAPD commanders' authorization of \"less lethal\" force (as distinct from the application \nof such force). \nAt the hearing on this motion, Defendants opposed certification because the LAPD \nis in the process of investigating which individual officers may be subject to discipline or \nliability.  However, the scope of the Department's investigation is necessarily limited.  It \nis difficult to determine the identity of the officers responsible for any particular injuries, \nbecause the officers wore riot gear that obscured their name tags and they fired munitions \nfrom various skirmish lines.  Despite the extensive video coverage of the event, thus far \nthe LAPD has identified only twenty-six officers for individual investigations.  Hence, \nindividualized assessments of whether an officer's use of force was reasonable will not be \npossible for the majority of putative class members.  The LAPD's internal investigation is \nnot a reason to defer certification. \nThe Court recognizes that the conduct of individual officers in the field may \npresent individual issues of reasonableness, namely whether it was reasonable under the \ncircumstances for a particular officer to fire less-lethal munitions, use his baton to strike \npeople, or use other forms of force, such as pushing and shoving. \nNonetheless, the individual issues share a common source:  the command decisions \nto disperse the crowd and to authorize the use of less-lethal munitions if the crowd's \nbehavior warranted it.  LAPD Report at 8, 34-35.  Because the legality of these command \ndecisions is the overriding common question, the predominance requirement is met as to \nthe Fourth Amendment claim. \n!OSee California v. Hodari D., 499 U.S. 621, 626 (1991) (\"The word 'seizure' readily bears the \nmeaning oflaying on of hands or application of physical force to restrain movement, even when it is \nultimately unsuccessful.\"); Marbet v.

Municipal liability under § 1983 requires \nproof of three elements: a policymaker, an official policy, and a violation of \nconstitutional rights whose \"moving force\" is the policy or custom.  Monell v. Dep't of \nSocial Services, 436 U.S. 658,694 (1978).  To hold the municipality liable, a plaintiff \nmust demonstrate that the official policy \"evidences 'a deliberate indifference' to his \nconstitutional rights,\" and caused his injury.  See Oviatt v. Pearce, 954 F.2d 1470, 1474 \n(9th Cir. 1992) (quoting City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378,389-91 (1989)). \nPlaintiffs allege that the City's failure to implement policies to ensure the rights of \ndemonstrators, given the City's obligations under the NLG and Crespo settlements, arises \nto a municipal policy or custom of deliberate indifference to the First Amendment rights \nof the public.  The elements of Plaintiffs' Monell claim rely on proof involving the City \nof Los Angeles's policies and practices, and will not require facts individual to each class \nmember's claims. \nFor an employer to be liable for an assault or other intentional tort, the tort must \nhave a causal nexus to the employee's work.  Lisa M  v. Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial \nHospital, 12 Ca1.4th 291,297 (1995).  Here, for the most part whether the actions of the \nindividual police officers have the requisite causal nexus will be a common question, \nbecause the police officers had been assigned to crowd control for the event and most \nincidents of use of force occurred as a result of the command decisions. \n2. Rule 23(b)(3) factor two: Class treatment is a superior method of \nadjudication. \nCV-90 (06/04)  Page 22 of25 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 41      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 29 of 31\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \n;~~~~~()~\\  ~;D~e \nCV 07-3072 AHM (FMOx)  \" December 14,2007 \n\"!;~>i;;';tf; MULTI-ETHNIC IMMIGRANT WORKERS ORGANIZING NETWORK, et at. v. \n:!:~;'* CITY OF LOS ANGELES  et at. \n1'4:::,;- ;%;  , \nwhen it would bring about \"undesirable results.\"  Advisory Committee Notes, 39 F.R.D. \n69, 103. \n(a) The interests of class members in individually controlling separate \nactions and the extent and nature of litigation already commenced. \nDefendants argue that class members' individual damages are not small, that they \nhave an emotional stake in the litigation and that they will therefore want to individually \nprosecute the action.  Defendants further claim there is a likelihood of more opt-outs than \nclass members.  Defendants provide little support for this argument.  Of the more than \n6,000 people in the damages class, 300 or so have filed claims (individually or in a \ngroup) against the City.  Thirteen lawsuits are currently pending: six before this Court \nand seven in state court.  MIWON counsel claims to represent over 176 claimants who \nhave agreed to be a part of the class action.  Realistically, the only people who may \nchoose to opt out are those who are prosecuting their own lawsuits in federal or state \ncourt.  Whatever the number, they will represent a small minority of claimants.  In any \nevent, the fact that some class members may wish to opt out does not lead to the \nconclusion that a class action is inappropriate, because it is their right under Rule \n23(b)(3) and not uncommon in large class actions. \n(b) The desirability of concentrating the action. \nThis factor favors class certification because all claims arise from same location, \ndate, and time period.  FA  C ~ 87.  The Court is amenable to coordinating the federal \ncases with those in state court. \n(c) Manageability. \nPlaintiffs have anticipated many of the management concerns the Court might \nhave.  A number of management tools are available to addressed individualized damages \nissues, such as bifurcating liability and damages trials, appointing a magistrate judge or \nspecial master to preside over damages proceedings, and creating subclasses as permitted \nunder Rule 23(c)(4).  Plaintiffs note that damages may be assessed class-wide based on a \nformula or through test trials.  Plaintiffs also have contemplated various methods of \nproviding the best notice practicable.

Wash. 2006) (protesters were surrounded by police in a \"no protest zone\" \nand arrested).  Vietnam War protests in Washington D.C. also gave rise to a prominent \nRule 23(b)(3) class action.  See Dellums v. Powell, 566 F.2d 167, 174 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (a \nclass consisting of \"all persons who were arrested while assembled on the Capitol steps \non May 5, 1971).  But see McCarthy v. Kleindienst, 741 F.2d 1406, 1415 n. 11 (D.C. Cir. \n1984) (deferring to district court's denial of class certification and noting that \"Dellums \nconsisted only of those persons arrested on the steps of the U.S. Capitol, a much more \ncohesive group than the approximately 7,000 putative class members here who were \narrested throughout the city.\").  Courts have also certified Rule 23(b) (3) classes in \ncontexts analogous to mass demonstrations.  See, e.g., Tardiffv. Knox County, 365 F.3d \n1, 6-7 (1 st Cir. 2004) (strip searches of pre-arraignment jail detainees); Williams v. \nBrown, 214 F.R.D. 484, 485 (N.D.

Ill. 1990) (strip searches of female arrestees). \nIt bears emphasizing that the primary policy of the class action mechanism is to \nenable the collective vindication of the rights of numerous persons whose claims are not \nworth litigating in individual actions.  See Amchem Prods., Inc. v.  Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, \n617 (1997).  As Plaintiffs point out, this rationale is particularly applicable here, where \nsome class members may feel hesitant about coming forward on their own because they \nmay be (or were at the time) in this country unlawfully.  Cf Patrykus v.  Gomilla, 121 \nF.R.D. 357, 361 (N.D.

INTRODUCTION\nThis is one of several civil rights actions arising from the Los Angeles Police\nDepartment’s (“LAPD”) forceful dispersal of the May 1, 2007 immigration rally at\nMacArthur Park.  It is, of course, not surprising that such a momentous clash would\nspawn litigation, but because that event was so highly publicized, it has also triggered\nextensive commentary.  The Court will not add to others’ reflections about what May\nDay 2007 says about the City of Los Angeles.  In this order the Court will only rule on\nthe Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification.  For the following reasons, the Court\nGRANTS that motion.1\nII. BACKGROUND\nThe LAPD recently issued a detailed report containing a minute-by-minute account\nof the events of May Day 2007 (“LAPD Report”).2  It is largely consistent with the\nfactual allegations in the FAC.  The events were also extensively captured on video.  The\nfollowing facts are evidently undisputed (unless otherwise noted).\n1Docket No. 17.\n2Plaintiffs’ Request for Judicial Notice, Los Angeles Police Department Report to the Board of\nCommissioners, An Examination of May Day 2007 (Oct. 9, 2007), Reply Ex.

FAC ¶ 50. \nThe permitted events consisted of a morning march and rally in downtown Los Angeles3\nand a final rally at MacArthur Park.  LAPD Report at 7.  The MacArthur Park rally was\npermitted to continue until 9:00 p.m.  FAC ¶ 6.  By 5:00 p.m, an estimated 6,000 to 7,000\npeople were present in or around MacArthur Park.  LAPD Report at 7.  A number of\nevents created tensions among demonstrators and police.4  In the immediately\nprecipitating incident, a group of 20 or 30 “anarchist kids” began throwing objects at the\npolice, including water bottles and gravel.  LAPD Report at 8, 32-33. \nAs officers in the field radioed in reports that they were “taking rocks and bottles”\nand that unruly elements were inciting the crowd, two groups of supervising officers\ndiscussed plans to disperse the crowd.  LAPD Report at 33-34.  Despite some\nmiscommunication along the chain of command, the discussions resulted in “a decision to\ndeclare an unlawful assembly and disperse the crowd.”  LAPD Report at 8.  “[The] plan\ninvolved the use of Metropolitan Division [an elite LAPD unit] resources to move the\ncrowd from the south side of the park northbound from 7th and Alvarado toward the\nnorth side of the park.”  Id.  The LAPD commanders also gave authorization to use “less-\nlethal” munitions if the behavior of the crowd warranted it.  Id. at 34-35.  \n“At 6:17 p.m., the Metropolitan Division B-Platoon formed a skirmish line, and\nwithout a dispersal order being given, moved the crowd northbound, pushing and striking\nsome individuals in the crowd, including some members of the media, and firing less-\nlethal munitions.”  Id. at 8; FAC ¶ 7. A few minutes later, a police helicopter broadcast a\npartial dispersal order:  “This is the Los Angeles Police Department. (Inaudible) . . . This\nis now an unlawful assembly.  Everybody needs to leave the park immediately.”  LAPD\nReport at 38.  This order was broadcast in English and was inaudible to many in the park,\nincluding certain LAPD commanders, who in the next ten minutes sought confirmation\nthat an order had been given.  See LAPD Report at 40; FAC ¶ 7.  By 6:41 p.m., when the\n3The LAPD Report states that the morning events took place in “Central Area,” which is an\nLAPD designation for downtown Los Angeles.  MacArthur Park is in the “Rampart Area.”\n4For example, at one of the entrances to the park, the police formed a skirmish line to direct the\ncrowd into a particular entrance, thereby raising tensions with the crowd.  LAPD Report at 8.\nCV-90 (06/04) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 2 of 25\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 40      Filed 12/14/2007     Page 3 of 25\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. CV 07-3072 AHM (FMOx) Date December 14, 2007\nTitle MULTI-ETHNIC IMMIGRANT WORKERS ORGANIZING NETWORK, et al. v.\nCITY OF LOS ANGELES, et al.\nLAPD drive to clear the park ended, “officers had driven thousands of people from the\npark, knocked over and struck some individuals – including media and non-media,\npeaceful or not – and deployed a total of 146 less-lethal impact munitions and over 100\nuses of the baton.”  LAPD Report at 9.\nAs a result of the LAPD’s forceful dispersal of the rally, MIWON, its five member\norganizations, and twelve individuals filed this putative class action against the City of\nLos Angeles, William Bratton (the Chief of Police), Cayler Carter (Deputy Chief of\nPolice), Louis Gray (an LAPD commander), and Does 1 through 10.  A group of\nattorneys from over a dozen law firms (“MIWON counsel”) jointly represent the named\nplaintiffs as well as a large number of unnamed plaintiffs, totaling over 180 people.  \nPlaintiffs seek appointment of the twelve named individual plaintiffs as class\nrepresentatives and appointment of MIWON counsel as class counsel.\nThe First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) contains seven claims seeking relief for\nviolations of various rights:\n1. Freedom of speech and association, pursuant to the First and Fourteenth\nAmendments, and 42 U.S.C. § 1983;\n2. Equal protection, pursuant to the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and 42\nU.S.C. § 1983;\n3.  Right to be free from excessive force, pursuant to the Fourth and Fourteenth\nAmendments, and 42 U.S.C. § 1983;\n4. Due process, pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment and 42 U.S.C. § 1983;\n5. Right to be free from threats, intimidation or coercion under California Civil\nCode § 52.1;\n6. Right to be free from violence or intimidation under California Civil Code §\n51.7; and\n7. Right to be free from assault and battery.\nThe organizational plaintiffs seek only injunctive relief.  The individual plaintiffs seek\ncompensatory, statutory and exemplary damages, and injunctive relief individually and as\nclass representatives. \n/ / /\nCV-90 (06/04) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 3 of 25\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 40      Filed 12/14/2007     Page 4 of 25\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. CV 07-3072 AHM (FMOx) Date December 14, 2007\nTitle MULTI-ETHNIC IMMIGRANT WORKERS ORGANIZING NETWORK, et al. v.\nCITY OF LOS ANGELES, et al.\nPlaintiffs initially moved to certify the following two classes under Rule 23(b)(2)\nand 23(b)(3):\n \n(1) An injunctive class defined as “all persons who in the past, or may in the future,\nengage in peaceful demonstrations or protest in the City of Los Angeles.”  \n(2) A damages class defined as “those persons who were present on May 1, 2007 in\nor around MacArthur Park at any point between the hours of 5:00 and 7:00 p.m., who did\nnot engage in any conduct justifying Defendants’ dispersal order or the use of force, and\nwho were subjected to the LAPD’s use of force, dispersal order or other unlawful police\nactivity in MacArthur Park, or along Wilshire Boulevard, Alvarado Boulevard, 7th Street\nor Park View Street, or in the vicinity of those streets.”\nAt a hearing conducted on October 29, 2007, the Court pointed out various\nproblems with the proposed class definitions.  Those problems related primarily to\nwhether the proposed class representatives had standing to pursue the injunctive class and\nwhether the proposed damages class was sufficiently discrete and manageable to warrant\ncertification.  Following the hearing, Plaintiffs modified their proposals and now they\npropose these classes:\n(1) An injunctive class defined as:  “Those who in the past have engaged in or who\nin the future may engage in peaceful demonstrations or protest in the City of Los Angeles\nand who, at the time they engage in such peaceful demonstrations or protest, were or are:\n(a) The following organizations: Multi-Ethnic Immigrant Workers\nOrganizing Network, Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles,\nKoreatown Immigrant Workers Alliance, Institute for Popular Education of Southern\nCalifornia, Pilipino Workers Center, Garment Workers Center (“Plaintiff Associations”);\n(b) Officers, representatives, or members of Plaintiff Associations;\n(c) Persons who attend or participate in Plaintiff Associations’ events,\nincluding but not limited to their rallies;\n(d) Organizations who advocate and/or organize on behalf of the rights of\nindividuals and associations to engage in speech, assembly, and expression\nwithin the scope of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.”\n(2) A damages class defined as:  “Those persons who were present on May 1, 2007\nCV-90 (06/04) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 4 of 25\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 40      Filed 12/14/2007     Page 5 of 25\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. CV 07-3072 AHM (FMOx) Date December 14, 2007\nTitle MULTI-ETHNIC IMMIGRANT WORKERS ORGANIZING NETWORK, et al. v.\nCITY OF LOS ANGELES, et al.\nin the geographic area bounded by 6th Street (on the north), Alvarado Street (on the east),\n7th Street (on the south), and Park View Street (on the west), or the immediately adjacent\nareas, including along 6th Street to Lafayette Park, at any point between the hours of 5:00\nand 7:00 p.m., who did not engage in any conduct justifying Defendants’ dispersal order\nor the use of force, and who were subjected to the LAPD’s use of force, dispersal order or\nother unlawful police activity arising from the police response to the immigration march\nand rally.”\nIII. LEGAL STANDARD\nThe party seeking class certification bears the burden of establishing that each of\nthe four requirements of Rule 23(a) and at least one requirement of Rule 23(b) have been\nmet.  Dukes v. Wal-Mart, Inc., --- F.3d ---, 2007 WL 4303055 *4 (9th Cir., Dec. 11, \n2007) (citing Zinser v. Accufix Research Institute, Inc., 253 F.3d 1180, 1186 (9th Cir.\n2001), amended, 273 F.3d 1266 (9th Cir. 2001)).  A district court may certify a class only\nif, after “rigorous analysis,” it determines that the party seeking certification has met its\nburden.  General Telephone Co. of the Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 158-161\n(1982).  However, in determining whether plaintiffs have carried their burden, the court\nmay not consider the merits of their claims.  See Dukes, 2007 WL 4303055 at *4.  Rather,\nin reviewing a motion for class certification, the Court generally is bound to take the\nsubstantive allegations of the complaint as true.  In re Coordinated Pretrial Proceedings\nin Petroleum Products Antitrust Litig., 691 F.2d 1335, 1342 (9th Cir. 1982) (citing\nBlackie v. Barrack, 524 F.2d 891, 901 (9th Cir. 1975)).  Nevertheless, the Court may look\nbeyond the pleadings to determine whether the requirements of Rule 23 have been met. \nHanon v.

DISCUSSION\nA. Standing\nA party cannot be a proper representative of a class if such party lacks standing\nindividually to pursue the claims of the class.  Hawkins v. Comparet-Cassani, 251 F.3d\n1230, 1238 (9th Cir. 2001).  \nTo have Article III standing to seek injunctive relief on behalf of a class, a named\nplaintiff must have suffered harm constituting “actual injury.”  Armstrong v. Davis, 275\nF.3d 849, 860-61(9th Cir. 2001) (internal citations omitted) (citing O’Shea v. Littleton,\n414 U.S. 488, 494 (1974), Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 348-49 (1996), and City of Los\nAngeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 109 (1983)).  There is no dispute that the individual\nPlaintiffs have alleged actual and direct injury – being driven out of a public park and\nsurrounding areas, as well as physical injury.  Each Plaintiff has alleged that he (or she)\nwas present at MacArthur Park as a demonstrator, observer of the rally, or recreational\nuser of the park at the time of the forceful dispersal, and that he (or she) suffered physical\ninjury due to the LAPD’s use of force.

Defendants argue that Plaintiffs do not face a real and\nimmediate threat of being prevented by the LAPD from participating in a lawful and\npeaceful demonstration in the future.  \nNine of the twelve individual Plaintiffs have submitted declarations making it clear\nthat they frequent MacArthur Park and other public areas, whether for demonstrations or\nrecreation, and intend to do so in the future.  See Reply Ex. B (Declarations of Breslin,\nCuellar, Eng, Galvez, Gomez, Maldonaldo, Ortiz, Pedro and Rothe-Kushel).

Nelson, 762 F.2d\n1318, 1323 (9th Cir. 1985)).  As the Ninth Circuit elaborated, “where the defendants have\nrepeatedly engaged in the injurious acts in the past, there is a sufficient possibility that\nthey will engage in them in the near future to satisfy the ‘realistic repetition’\nrequirement.”  Armstrong, 275 F.3d at 961; see also Thomas v. County of Los Angeles,\n978 F.2d 504, 507 (9th Cir. 1992) (noting that the “possibility of recurring injury ceases\nto be speculative when actual repeated incidents are documented.”) (citation omitted).\nThe LAPD has issued unlawful dispersal orders and displayed excessive force\norders against demonstrators in the past.  Some of the incidents are documented in\nlawsuits, such as the Los Angeles Superior Court cases Marmillion v. City of Los Angeles\n(BC 059778), arising out of a large demonstration in October 1991; and Vassos v. City of\nLos Angeles (BC 080155) and Shefik v. City of Los Angeles (BC 080092), arising from\nmass arrests of protesters in 1992.  Declaration of Carol A. Sobel in Support of Plaintiffs’\nSupplemental Memorandum (“Sobel Supp. Decl.”) ¶¶ 2, 4.  Vassos and Shefik ended in a\ncombined settlement agreement in 1995, involving monetary payment as well as LAPD\npolicy changes and training requirements.  Id. ¶¶ 5-6 & Ex. C.  Notably, that settlement\nincluded provisions defining an unlawful assembly, distinguishing an unlawful assembly\nfrom unlawful conduct by isolated individuals, and setting forth requirements for\ndispersal orders.  Id., Ex. C, ¶¶ 10, 12, 14.\nAt the Democratic National Convention in 2000, the LAPD declared an unlawful\nassembly in the public demonstration area, ordered the crowd to disperse, and used\nrubber bullets, batons and other forms of physical force as the crowd attempted to\ndisperse.  That mêlée led to three federal lawsuits in this District:  National Lawyers\nGuild v. City of Los Angeles (CV 01-6877) (“NLG”), Berg v. City of Los Angeles  (CV\n01-7046), and Crespo v. City of Los Angeles (CV 00-8869).  The NLG and Crespo cases\nended in settlements that set forth standards for the LAPD in regards to unlawful\nassemblies, dispersal orders, and treatment of the media.  See Mem.

Sobel Supp. Decl., Ex. E\n(Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment\nat 12-13 (CV 01-6877, Dec. 3, 2003)).\nThe LAPD itself has acknowledged that what happened on May Day 2007 was not\nan isolated incident:  “Chief Bratton was concerned that the Department had identified\nmany of these problems in the past and that the lessons learned had been forgotten.” \nLAPD Report at 74.  The LAPD Report also acknowledges that the treatment of the\nmedia at May Day 2007 failed to comply with the NLG and Crespo settlement\nagreements.  LAPD Report at 10, 11, 48.  The Report further identified a number of\nreasons for the repetition on May Day 2007 of the kind of police misconduct that\noccurred at the Democratic National Convention some seven years earlier.  For example,\nit noted: “Over the past several years, there appears to have been a gradual diminution of\nan arrest posture during organized crowd control situations. The Department has moved\nfrom a posture of isolating and arresting those who are engaging in unlawful activity or\ndisrupting a rally or demonstration, to a posture of declaring an unlawful assembly and\nclearing the entire area.”  Id. at 52.  The report also faulted the scaling back of training in\ncrowd control and treatment of the media, suggesting it was “non-required” training that\nwas “not a priority,” given other demands on LAPD resources.  Id. at 63-64.  \nIn short, May Day 2007 was not an isolated event caused by unusual or isolated\nfactors. \nThe injunction that Plaintiffs now seek generally mirrors the standards set forth in\nthe NLG Settlement and incorporates the principles from the Vassos-Shefik settlement. \nSee Mem. Ex. 37; Sobel Supp. Decl., Ex. C.  Indeed, the LAPD Report explicitly\nrecognizes that standards in the NLG and Crespo settlements apply.  LAPD Report\nAppendix 1 (Summary of the measures that the LAPD agreed to enact as part of the\nsettlements resulting from the 2000 Democratic National Convention).  However, those\nsettlements were private agreements, not consent decrees or court injunctions.  Moreover,\nsome of the settlement language was permissive, lacking the precision and force of a\nlegal decree.  For example, the NLG Settlement provided that the LAPD may use less-\nlethal weapons under certain circumstances, rather than that the LAPD is prohibited from\nusing those weapons except under certain circumstances.

Resp. to Pls.’ Supp. Mem. at 2.  Defendants cite\nto the LAPD Report’s description of the Incident Management and Training Bureau,\nestablished in July 2007, the institution of Department-wide training in crowd control and\nFirst Amendment issues, and several examples of successful LAPD management of mass\ndemonstrations since May 2007.  Id., Hillman Decl. ¶¶ 1-8.  Defendants also emphasize\nthat historically there have been more events and rallies with no LAPD misconduct than\nthose with problems, pointing to May Day 2006 as an example of a very similar\ndemonstration that was successful.  Id. ¶ 9.\nDefendants’ showing is insufficient to deny Plaintiffs standing to seek injunctive\nrelief.  In the past, the LAPD has undertaken efforts to revise its policies and train LAPD\nofficers to ensure proper management of demonstrations, albeit those efforts were not as\nextensive as the post-May Day 2007 efforts are touted to be.  See Sobel Supp. Decl. ¶ 6 &\nEx. C ¶¶ 7-17 (policies and training changes as part of the Vassos-Shefik settlement). \nAlthough steps were taken in the immediate aftermath of previous litigation, nevertheless\nnew instances of misconduct occurred.  The Court cannot find that the measures the\nLAPD took after May 2007 have achieved, in a mere six months, the reforms that\nplaintiffs in previous cases sought for over a decade. \nDefendants’ contention that their overall record of complying with constitutional\nrequirements relating to crowd control is more positive than negative is similarly\nunpersuasive.  Defendants suggest that Plaintiffs lack standing because the LAPD’s\nrecord with regards to May Day immigration rallies is “1 and 1\" – i.e., as successful in\n2006 as it was unsuccessful in 2007.  Def. Resp. at 3.  This argument actually hurts\nDefendants: if the odds of an alleged constitutional violation recurring were 50 percent, a\nsufficient case or controversy would be present.  \n/ / /\n/ / /\nCV-90 (06/04) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 9 of 25\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 40      Filed 12/14/2007     Page 10 of 25\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. CV 07-3072 AHM (FMOx) Date December 14, 2007\nTitle MULTI-ETHNIC IMMIGRANT WORKERS ORGANIZING NETWORK, et al. v.\nCITY OF LOS ANGELES, et al.\nIn any event, to establish a case or controversy Plaintiffs need not establish that\nfuture harm is certain, or even probable.  What they must establish is that recurrence is\nnot “conjectural” or “hypothetical,” as it would be if future injury were contingent on\nmultiple unlikely assumptions.  See Lyons, 461 U.S. at 105-08 (threat of future injury not\nsufficiently real and immediate to establish existing controversy where the claim of future\ninjury rested on assumption that plaintiffs would engage in conduct leading to an\nencounter with police involving the use of a chokehold).  Given Plaintiffs’ declarations,\nthe contents of the LAPD Report and the unfortunate history of civil rights violations by\nLAPD officers,5 it is clear that here the threat of future injury is not merely conjectural or\nhypothetical.  Although the Court applauds the LAPD’s remedial actions since May Day\n2007, the Court finds that the individual Plaintiffs are “realistically threatened by a\nrepetition of [the violation.]”  Lyons at 109.  \nThis conclusion is consistent with Lyons and Ninth Circuit precedent.  In Hodgers-\nDurgin v. De La Vina, a case which Defendant cites, the Ninth Circuit distinguished\nLyons on the ground that in Lyons, the police chokehold that was the alleged injury\noccurred during a traffic stop prompted by Lyons’s misconduct.  199 F.3d 1037, 1041-42\n(9th Cir. 1999) (en banc) (stating that the Supreme Court in Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S.\n1, 15 (1998) “characterized the denial of Article III standing in Lyons as having been\nbased on the plaintiff's ability to avoid engaging in illegal conduct.”). The plaintiffs in\nHodgers-Durgin had standing to challenge the Border Patrol’s practice of stopping\nmotorists without reasonable suspicion because driving vehicles near the Mexican border\nis innocent conduct and therefore they had no duty to avoid another stop by the Border\nPatrol.  Id. at 1041.  Moreover, there was “no string of contingencies necessary to\nproduce an injury.”  Id. at 1042-43.  This case is like Hodgers-Durgin and not like Lyons\nfor the same reasons.  Plaintiffs claim that they were engaged in innocent conduct when\nthey were unjustifiably driven from MacArthur Park and surrounding areas.  Like the\nplaintiffs in Hodgers-Durgin, they are neither able to nor required to prevent the\npossibility of that injury being repeated.\n5See Report of the Independent Commission on the Los Angeles Police Department (1991) (the\n“Christopher Commission Report”); Consent Decree, United States v.

Adequacy of Class Definitions\nRule 23 requires that a class be defined.  See Board of School Commissioners of\nCity of Indianapolis v. Jacobs, 420 U.S. 128, 130 (1975) (finding error in district court’s\nfailure to identify a class).  However, the contours of the class need not be so clear that\nevery potential member may be identified at the time of class certification.  Probe v. State\nTeachers’ Retirement System, 780 F.2d 776, 780 (9th Cir. 1986).  Rather, “a class will be\nfound to exist if the description of the class is definite enough so that it is\nadministratively feasible for the court to ascertain whether an individual is a member.” \nO'Connor v. Boeing N. Am., Inc., 184 F.R.D. 311, 319 (C.D. Cal. 1998) (citing Aiken v.\nObledo, 442 F.Supp. 628, 658 (E.D. Cal. 1977)); Manual for Complex Litigation (Fourth)\n§ 21.222 (2004).\nBased on the proposals the Court circulated at the hearing and the minor\nmodifications Plaintiffs suggested in their supplemental brief, the Court will certify the\nfollowing classes:\n1. Damages class definition.\n“Those persons who were present on May 1, 2007 in the geographic area bounded by 6th\nStreet (on the north), Alvarado Street (on the east), 7th Street (on the south), and Park\nView Street (on the west), or the immediately adjacent areas, including from 6th Street\nwest to Lafayette Park, at any point between the hours of 5:00 and 7:00 p.m., who did not\nengage in any conduct justifying Defendants’ dispersal order or the use of force, and who\nwere subjected to the LAPD’s use of force, dispersal order or other unlawful police\nactivity arising from the police response to the immigration march and rally.”\n2. Injunctive class definition.\n“Those who in the past have engaged in or who in the future may engage in peaceful\ndemonstrations or protest in the City of Los Angeles and who, at the time they engage in\nsuch peaceful demonstrations or protest, were or are:\n(a) The following organizations: Multi-Ethnic Immigrant Workers Organizing\nNetwork, Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, Koreatown Immigrant\nWorkers Alliance, Institute for Popular Education of Southern California, Pilipino\nWorkers Center, Garment Workers Center (“Plaintiff Associations”);\nCV-90 (06/04) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 11 of 25\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 40      Filed 12/14/2007     Page 12 of 25\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. CV 07-3072 AHM (FMOx) Date December 14, 2007\nTitle MULTI-ETHNIC IMMIGRANT WORKERS ORGANIZING NETWORK, et al. v.\nCITY OF LOS ANGELES, et al.\n(b) Officers, representatives, or members of Plaintiff Associations;\n(c) Persons who attend or participate in Plaintiff Associations’ events, including\nbut not limited to their rallies;\n(d) Organizations that advocate, organize, or both advocate and organize on behalf\nof the rights of individuals and associations to engage in speech, assembly, and\nexpression within the scope of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.\n(e) Persons who participate in public assemblies organized by the organizations\ndescribed in paragraph (d).”\nDefendants object that the size of this injunctive class is open-ended and without\ntemporal limit (i.e., it could include persons who first became eligible for class\nmembership only after the class was certified).  They also contend that the terms\n“peaceful” and “demonstration” are not defined.  Finally, they argue that class\nmembership cannot be objectively determined, because it would turn on each potential\nclass member’s state of mind.  Not so.\nAs a general matter, less precision is required of class definitions under Rule\n23(b)(2) than under Rule 23(b)(3), where mandatory notice is required by due process. \nSee Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U.S. 797, 812 (holding that notice of right to\nopt-out of suit for money damages is required by the Due Process Clause); Yaffe v.\nPowers, 454 F.2d 1362, 1366 (1st Cir. 1972) (stating that in contrast to certification of a\nsubdivision (b)(3) class, “notice to the members of a (b)(2) class is not required and the\nactual membership of the class need not therefore be precisely delimited.”). \nManageability is not as important a concern for injunctive classes as for damages classes. \nSee Elliott v. Weinberger, 564 F.2d 1219, 1229 (9th Cir. 1977) (“by its terms, Rule 23\nmakes manageability an issue important only in determining the propriety of certifying an\naction as a (b)(3), not a (b)(2), class action.”), aff’d in pertinent part sub nom, Califano v.\nYamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 701 (1979).\nDefendants’ objection to the lack of a temporal limit lacks merit.  Indeed, the very\nnature of an injunctive class contemplates that there will be class members who can only\nbe determined in the future.  See Probe, 780 F.2d at 780; see also Carpenter v. Davis,\n424 F.2d 257, 260 (1st Cir. 1970) (approving injunctive class consisting of all who wish\nor expect to write for, publish, sell or distribute the newspaper in the future and\nemphasizing that “[t]he record is ample to show numerous such people in existence, as\nwell as the probability of others who may become members of the class in the future.”). \nCV-90 (06/04) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 12 of 25\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 40      Filed 12/14/2007     Page 13 of 25\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. CV 07-3072 AHM (FMOx) Date December 14, 2007\nTitle MULTI-ETHNIC IMMIGRANT WORKERS ORGANIZING NETWORK, et al. v.\nCITY OF LOS ANGELES, et al.\nAny temporal limit on the injunctive class in this case would be arbitrary.\nAlthough class definitions should avoid criteria that are subjective, the words\n“peaceful” and “demonstration” are objectively determinable descriptors of class\nmembers’ behavior.  Other courts have certified a class defined with similar language. \nSee, e.g., Washington Mobilization Committee v. Cullinane, 400 F.Supp. 186, 218\n(D.D.C. 1975), rev’d in part on other grounds, 566 F.2d 107 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (certifying\nclass of “all persons who have participated in or observed and who intend to participate\nin or observe lawful, peaceful, orderly and non-obstructive public demonstrations for the\nexercise of their Constitutional rights of free speech and assembly”); Medrano v. Allee,\n1972 WL 714, *3 (S.D. Tex. Dec. 4, 1972), vac’d in part on other grounds, Allee v.\nMedrano, 416 U.S. 802 (1974). \nThis case is distinguishable from cases in which the class definition depended on\nthe states of mind of class members or defendants, such as Vietnam Veterans Against the\nWar v. Beinecke.  63 F.R.D. 675, 679-80 (W.D. Mo. 1974).  There, like here, plaintiffs\nalleged that the police deprived them of their right to assemble peacefully when their\nprotest march was cut short.  Id. at 677.  The proposed class definition encompassed\n“persons who attend or participate or who wish to attend or participate in any public\nassembly or demonstration in Kansas City, Missouri held by citizens groups or\norganizations whose political or social views conflict with those of the officials in the\ngovernment or the Kansas City, Missouri Police Department.”  Id. at 678.  This\ndefinition, the court held, was insufficient for determining membership in the class,\nbecause it was “based upon such a general and indefinite state of mind, encompassing a\nkaleidoscopic variety of mental positions. . . .”  Id. at 680.  Similarly, in Koen v. Long, a\nclass consisting of people belonging to organizations “that are unpopular with\ndefendants, and who participate in activities which are “controversial and unpopular with\ndefendants” was found to depend on the state of mind of defendants, and therefore\ninadequate.  302 F.Supp. 1383, 1387-89 (E.D. Mo. 1969), aff’d 428 F.2d 876 (8th Cir.\n1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 923 (1971). \nUnlike those cases, membership in the injunctive class proposed here does not\ndepend on the beliefs or state of mind of any individuals.  Rather, membership is based\non the putative class members’ conduct, activities, and affiliations.  These criteria are\nreadily susceptible to judicial determination.  See Alliance to End Repression v. American\nCivil Liberties Union, 565 F.2d 975, 978 (7th Cir. 1977) (holding that the injunctive class\nCV-90 (06/04) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 13 of 25\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 40      Filed 12/14/2007     Page 14 of 25\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. CV 07-3072 AHM (FMOx) Date December 14, 2007\nTitle MULTI-ETHNIC IMMIGRANT WORKERS ORGANIZING NETWORK, et al. v.\nCITY OF LOS ANGELES, et al.\nwas adequately defined because its scope is defined by the activities of the defendants\nwith no particular state of mind required).\nC. Rule 23(a) Requirements\n1. Numerosity\nRule 23(a)(1) requires that the class be “so numerous that joinder of all members is\nimpracticable.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1).  Dukes, 2007 WL 4303055 at *4.  The damages\nand injunctive classes indisputably meet this requirement.\nBased on the LAPD’s estimates of turnout, Plaintiffs logically estimate the\ndamages class to include over 6,000 people.6  As the LAPD Report confirmed, only a\nvery few people were disobedient or disorderly (or attacked the police), and therefore\npotentially ineligible.  Given these estimates, the damages class meets the numerosity\nrequirement.\nDefendants’ objection to Plaintiffs’ vague estimate of the size of the injunctive\nclass is not well taken.  Rule 23 does not require a numeric estimate of the number of\nclass members, if certification under Rule 23(b)(2) is sought.  See Advisory Committee\nNotes, 39 F.R.D. 69, 102 (“Illustrative [of 23(b)(2)] are various actions in the civil-rights\nfield where a party is charged with discriminating unlawfully against a class, usually one\nwhose members are incapable of specific enumeration.”) (emphasis added). \n2. Commonality\nRule 23(a)(2) requires that “there are questions of law or fact common to the\nclass.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2).  “Rule 23(a)(2) has been construed permissively.  All\nquestions of fact and law need not be common to satisfy the rule. The existence of shared\nlegal issues with divergent factual predicates is sufficient, as is a common core of salient\nfacts coupled with disparate legal remedies within the class.”  Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp.,\n150 F.3d 1011, 1019 (9th Cir. 1998).\n6The LAPD Report estimates that 6,000 to 7,000 were present in MacArthur Park at 5:00 p.m. \nThe damages class is comprised of those present in the park or immediately adjacent areas between 5:00\nand 7:00 p.m.\nCV-90 (06/04) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 14 of 25\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 40      Filed 12/14/2007     Page 15 of 25\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. CV 07-3072 AHM (FMOx) Date December 14, 2007\nTitle MULTI-ETHNIC IMMIGRANT WORKERS ORGANIZING NETWORK, et al. v.\nCITY OF LOS ANGELES, et al.\nThe LAPD’s command decisions to declare an unlawful assembly, disperse the\ncrowd, and authorize the use of force constitute the “common core of salient facts” that\nsupport commonality.

Typicality\nRule 23(a)(3) requires that “the claims or defenses of the representative parties are\ntypical of the claims or defenses of the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3).  The typicality\nrequirement “is designed to assure that the named representative’s interests are aligned\nwith those of the class.” Jordan v. County of Los Angeles, 669 F.2d 1311, 1321 (9th Cir.),\nvacated and remanded on other grounds, 459 U.S. 860 (1982).  Where such an alignment\nexists, a representative who vigorously pursues her own interests will necessarily advance\nthe interests of the class.  Id.  The Ninth Circuit interprets the typicality requirement\npermissively.  Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1020.  Named plaintiffs’ claims need not be identical\nto the claims of the class; rather, their claims are typical if they are “reasonably co-\nextensive with those of absent class members.”  Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1020.  “As long as\nthe named representative’s claim arises from the same event, practice, or course of\nconduct that forms the basis of the class claims, and is based upon the same legal theory,\nvarying factual differences between the claims or defenses of the class and the class\nrepresentative will not render the named representative’s claim atypical.”  Jordan, 669\nF.2d at 1321.\nAll of the proposed representatives claim they were driven from the park, all claim\nphysical injury and some claim to have had physical contact with the police.   Defendants\nnevertheless argue that typicality is lacking because the May Day incident gave rise to\ndifferent rights, injuries, and claims, depending on whether one was a participant, legal\nobserver, or bystander, whether one heard the dispersal order, whether one had physical\ncontact with the police, and whether one suffered physical injury.  Plaintiffs correctly\nrespond that one’s status as participant, observer or bystander does not defeat typicality\nas to their First Amendment claim, because that claim alleges that everyone had a First\nAmendment right to be in the park.  Similarly, one’s right to be free from excessive force\ndoes not depend on whether one was participating in the protest.  Nor do differences in\nphysical contact and injury defeat typicality as to the Fourth Amendment claim, because\nCV-90 (06/04) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 15 of 25\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 40      Filed 12/14/2007     Page 16 of 25\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. CV 07-3072 AHM (FMOx) Date December 14, 2007\nTitle MULTI-ETHNIC IMMIGRANT WORKERS ORGANIZING NETWORK, et al. v.\nCITY OF LOS ANGELES, et al.\nthey are permissible variations within a class.  See Vodak v. City of Chicago, 2006 WL\n1037151 at *6 (N.D. Ill. 2006) (similar variations in arrest and detention within large\ngroup of protesters did not defeat typicality).  As the Ninth Circuit noted in Hanlon,\n“[u]nder the rule’s permissive standards, representative claims are ‘typical’ if they are\nreasonably coextensive with those of absent class members; they need not be\nsubstantially identical.”  150 F.3d at 1020.  Under these standards, the proposed\nrepresentatives’ claims are typical.\n4. Adequacy of representation\nThe adequacy requirement of Rule 23(a) is that the “representative parties will\nfairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  This\nfactor requires: (1) that the proposed representative Plaintiffs do not have conflicts of\ninterest with the proposed classes, and (2) that Plaintiffs are represented by qualified and\ncompetent counsel who will prosecute the action vigorously on behalf of the class. \nDukes, 2007 WL 4303055 at *11 (citations omitted).  The declarations of Plaintiffs and\ntheir counsel satisfy these requirements.  Defendants’ only argument regarding adequacy\nis that the class representatives lack standing to seek an injunction.  The Court rejected\nthat argument, above.\n(a) Class representatives.\nPlaintiffs request that the twelve individually named plaintiffs be appointed class\nrepresentatives.  The Court will appoint as class representatives only those named\nplaintiffs who have filed declarations attesting to their understanding of their obligations\nas class representatives.  They are:  Kevin Breslin, David Gabriel Eng, Luis Galvez,\nGerardo Gomez, Jaime Maldonado, Leopoldo Ortiz, Romualdo Pedro, and Jeremy Rothe-\nKushel.7\n7Each of these eight individuals has submitted a second declaration with the Reply\nin support of their standing to represent an injunctive class.  Four of these individuals,\nBreslin, Gomez, Galvez, and Ortiz, submitted a third declaration after the hearing in\nsupport of their standing.\nCV-90 (06/04) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 16 of 25\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 40      Filed 12/14/2007     Page 17 of 25\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. CV 07-3072 AHM (FMOx) Date December 14, 2007\nTitle MULTI-ETHNIC IMMIGRANT WORKERS ORGANIZING NETWORK, et al. v.\nCITY OF LOS ANGELES, et al.\n(b) Class counsel and steering committee.\nThe Court appoints Barrett Litt, Carol Sobel and Paul Hoffman as lead class\ncounsel.   Those attorneys who filed actions on behalf of other clients who agree to be\nmembers of the damages class may serve on a steering committee.\nD. Rule 23(b)(2) Requirements\nCertification under Rule 23(b)(2) is appropriate where the opposing party “has\nacted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making\nappropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the\nclass as a whole.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  Originally designed for civil rights cases,\nRule 23(b)(2) class actions are limited to those class actions seeking primarily injunctive\nor corresponding relief.  Newberg on Class Actions, § 4.11 (4th ed. 2002). \nOther courts have certified Rule 23(b)(2) classes in cases involving police action\nagainst demonstrators.  See Chang v. United States, 217 F.R.D. 262, 264, 267 (D.D.C.\n2003) (certifying a class of persons arrested en masse during an anti-World Bank/IMF\nprotest in September 2002 in Washington D.C.); Washington Mobilization Committee v.\nCullinane, 400 F. Supp. 186, 219 n. 2 (D. D.C. 1975); Sullivan v. Murphy, 478 F.2d 938,\n967 (D.C. Cir. 1973) (noting class treatment was appropriate, despite the highly\nindividualized nature of probable cause, because it was “a situation in which the police\ndid not govern themselves by their ordinary procedures. . .And the arrests that were made\nwere the product of a common course of conduct by the police.”); Sullivan v. Murphy,\n380 F.Supp 867, 868 (D.D.C. 1974).8 \n8Defendants cited one mass demonstration case in which Rule 23(b)(2) certification\nwas denied, but on the ground that the class definition was inadequate (because it\ndepended on the “state of mind” of class members and defendants).  See Vietnam\nVeterans Against the War v. Benecke, 63 F.R.D. 675, 679-80 (W.D. Mo. 1974) (proposed\nclass “would encompass all persons of political or social persuasion different than\ngovernment officials and officers” of the city).  \nCV-90 (06/04) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 17 of 25\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 40      Filed 12/14/2007     Page 18 of 25\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. CV 07-3072 AHM (FMOx) Date December 14, 2007\nTitle MULTI-ETHNIC IMMIGRANT WORKERS ORGANIZING NETWORK, et al. v.\nCITY OF LOS ANGELES, et al.\n1. Act or refusal to act.\nThe mere fact that the LAPD declared an unlawful assembly and dispersed the\ncrowd at MacArthur Park is enough to meet the requirement that defendants acted on\ngrounds generally applicable to the class.  Moreover, Plaintiffs have alleged (and at this\nstage the Court must accept as true) that the LAPD has failed to adopt and/or implement\npolicies to prevent the infringement of the rights of demonstrators.  See FAC ¶¶ 28-39. \nThat Defendants have “acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the\nclass” is patently obvious based on the LAPD Report and the allegations at the heart of\nthis lawsuit.\n2. Impact of money damages on injunctive class certification.\nThe Ninth Circuit recently reiterated that Rule 23(b)(2) class actions can include\nclaims for monetary damages, so long as such damages are not the “predominant” relief\nsought, but instead are “secondary to the primary claim for injunctive or declaratory\nrelief.”  Dukes, 2007 WL 4303055 at *11 (internal quotations and citations omitted). \nMoreover, “the predominance test turns on the primary goal of the litigation--not the\ntheoretical or possible size of the damage award.”  Id. at *13.  \nPlaintiffs seek compensatory and special damages, damages pursuant to California\nCivil Code § 52, and exemplary damages “in an amount sufficient to deter and to make\nan example of [] defendants.”  FAC ¶¶ 118-120.  The Court should not and will not\nspeculate as to the possible size of the damage award.  “Focusing predominantly on the\nplaintiffs' intent in bringing the suit,” it is clear that injunctive relief predominates in this\ncase.  Id. at 1234.  Plaintiffs’ prayer for injunctive relief and the declarations supporting\nthis motion plainly demonstrate that the primary goal of the litigation is to secure the\nrights of demonstrators in the future, i.e. by holding the LAPD accountable for failing to\ncomply with policies and practices that it promised to implement pursuant to prior\nsettlement agreements.  See FAC ¶¶ 114-117; Reply Ex. A (LAPD’s summary of NLG\nSettlement); Reply Ex. B (Plaintiffs’ supplemental declarations); Mem. Ex. 37 (text of\nNLG Settlement).\nCV-90 (06/04) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 18 of 25\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 40      Filed 12/14/2007     Page 19 of 25\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. CV 07-3072 AHM (FMOx) Date December 14, 2007\nTitle MULTI-ETHNIC IMMIGRANT WORKERS ORGANIZING NETWORK, et al. v.\nCITY OF LOS ANGELES, et al.\n3. Manageability considerations.\nDefendants raise vague concerns about manageability in connection with the\npotential size of the injunctive class.  Manageability considerations do not justify denial\nof certification of a Rule 23(b)(2) class.  See Elliott, 564 F.2d at 1229 (“The [defendant]\ndoes not cite, nor can we find, any authority which supports his rather novel theory\nlimiting (b)(2) class actions because of their numerosity and manageability problems.  By\nits terms, Rule 23 makes manageability an issue important only in determining the\npropriety of certifying an action as a (b)(3), not a (b)(2), class action.”).\nE. Rule 23(b)(3) Requirements\nThe key questions under this analysis are: (1) whether common issues predominate\nover questions affecting only individual members and (2) whether the putative class\naction is superior to other methods for fair and efficient adjudication of the issues.  Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  “Subdivision (b)(3) encompasses those cases in which a class action\nwould achieve economies of time, effort, and expense, and promote uniformity of\ndecision as to persons similarly situated, without sacrificing procedural fairness or\nbringing about other undesirable results.”  Advisory Committee Notes, 39 F.R.D. 69,\n102-103. \n1. Rule 23(b)(3) factor one: Predominance.\n“When common questions present a significant aspect of the case and they can be\nresolved for all members of the class in a single adjudication, there is clear justification\nfor handling the dispute on a representative rather than on an individual basis.”  Hanlon,\n150 F.3d at 1022.  When one or more of the central issues in the action are common to\nthe class, the action may be considered proper under Rule 23(b)(3) even though other\nimportant matters will have to be tried separately, such as damages or some affirmative\ndefenses peculiar to some individual class members.  See Local Joint Executive Bd. of\nCulinary/Bartender Trust Fund v. Las Vegas Sands, Inc., 244 F.3d 1152, 1163 (9th Cir.\n2001) (holding that Rule 23(b)(3) predominance requirement was satisfied where all\nliability issues in employment case were the same and the only individualized issues\nrelated to the calculation of damages); Gunnells v. Healthplan Servs., Inc., 348 F.3d 417,\n428 (4th Cir.), cert. denied 124 S.Ct. 2837 (2003) (stating that because Rule 23(b)(3)\nactions usually require individual proof of damages, courts usually find predominance\nCV-90 (06/04) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 19 of 25\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 40      Filed 12/14/2007     Page 20 of 25\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. CV 07-3072 AHM (FMOx) Date December 14, 2007\nTitle MULTI-ETHNIC IMMIGRANT WORKERS ORGANIZING NETWORK, et al. v.\nCITY OF LOS ANGELES, et al.\nrequirement satisfied if common questions predominate over individual questions as to\nliability).\nAs discussed below, the common issues in the First Amendment claim, Fourth\nAmendment claim, Monell claim, and respondeat superior liability are more than\nsufficient to meet the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3).  Because the record\nthus far is insufficiently developed as to the alleged Fourteenth Amendment violations,\nthe Court declines at this time to include those claims among those the class may pursue.\n(a) First Claim for Relief:  First Amendment, § 1983 claim.\nAs to the First Amendment claim, Plaintiffs are correct that the only material fact is\nthat the LAPD decided to declare an unlawful assembly and disperse the crowd.  Even\nthe LAPD Report states that the First Amendment rights of peaceful individuals and\nmembers of media were curtailed.  LAPD Report at 51-52.  However, an individual\nquestion exists as to whether each class member, such as a random passerby, actually was\nengaged in protected First Amendment activity. \nFrom a practical point of view, common questions predominate, largely because\nmost of those present were engaged in protected activity.  See LAPD Report at 4, 51, 52. \nGiven the intangible nature of First Amendment rights and values, it makes sense to\nassess damages on this claim on the basis of criteria applicable to the class as a whole,\nsuch as the degree to which the police action curtailed the planned events.  The court or\njury could then determine the total compensation appropriate for that loss or the\nreasonable award for each victim.  See, e.g., Dellums, 566 F.2d at 174 (jury awarded\nuniform compensatory damages per class member for violations of First Amendment\nrights).\n(b) Third, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Claims for Relief:  Fourth\nAmendment and related state claims for excessive force.9 \n/ / /\n9Counsel for Defendants acknowledged at the hearing that the Fourth Amendment claim will be\nsimilar to the state law claims for most putative class members.\nCV-90 (06/04) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 20 of 25\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 40      Filed 12/14/2007     Page 21 of 25\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. CV 07-3072 AHM (FMOx) Date December 14, 2007\nTitle MULTI-ETHNIC IMMIGRANT WORKERS ORGANIZING NETWORK, et al. v.\nCITY OF LOS ANGELES, et al.\nThe Fourth Amendment prohibits the use of unreasonable force in effecting a\nsearch or seizure of a suspect.  The LAPD use or threat of force against the assembled\ncrowd may constitute a seizure,10 although there are individual factual questions as to\nwhether a given officer caused a particular individual to be displaced by the use or threat\nof force.  The parties focus their arguments not on whether there was a seizure, but on\nwhether the actions of the police officers were reasonable.  Thus, Plaintiffs focus on the\nLAPD commanders’ authorization of “less lethal” force (as distinct from the application\nof such force). \nAt the hearing on this motion, Defendants opposed certification because the LAPD\nis in the process of investigating which individual officers may be subject to discipline or\nliability.  However, the scope of the Department’s investigation is necessarily limited.   It\nis difficult to determine the identity of the officers responsible for any particular injuries,\nbecause the officers wore riot gear that obscured their name tags and they fired munitions\nfrom various skirmish lines.  Despite the extensive video coverage of the event, thus far\nthe LAPD has identified only twenty-six officers for individual investigations.  Hence,\nindividualized assessments of whether an officer’s use of force was reasonable will not be\npossible for the majority of putative class members.  The LAPD’s internal investigation is\nnot a reason to defer certification.\nThe Court recognizes that the conduct of individual officers in the field may\npresent individual issues of reasonableness, namely whether it was reasonable under the\ncircumstances for a particular officer to fire less-lethal munitions, use his baton to strike\npeople, or use other forms of force, such as pushing and shoving.\nNonetheless, the individual issues share a common source:  the command decisions\nto disperse the crowd and to authorize the use of less-lethal munitions if the crowd’s\nbehavior warranted it.  LAPD Report at 8, 34-35.  Because the legality of these command\ndecisions is the overriding common question, the predominance requirement is met as to\nthe Fourth Amendment claim.\n10See California v. Hodari D., 499 U.S. 621, 626 (1991) (“The word ‘seizure’ readily bears the\nmeaning of laying on of hands or application of physical force to restrain movement, even when it is\nultimately unsuccessful.”); Marbet v. City of Portland, 2003 WL 23540258 (D. Or. 2003) (holding that\nplaintiffs stated a Fourth Amendment claim where police moved a crowd of protestors 120 feet through\nuse of pepper spray and physical force).  \nCV-90 (06/04) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 21 of 25\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 40      Filed 12/14/2007     Page 22 of 25\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. CV 07-3072 AHM (FMOx) Date December 14, 2007\nTitle MULTI-ETHNIC IMMIGRANT WORKERS ORGANIZING NETWORK, et al. v.\nCITY OF LOS ANGELES, et al.\n \n(c) The Monell claim and respondeat superior.\nMunicipal liability for civil rights violations and employer liability under tort law\npresent predominantly common issues as well.  Municipal liability under § 1983 requires\nproof of three elements: a policymaker, an official policy, and a violation of\nconstitutional rights whose “moving force” is the policy or custom.  Monell v. Dep’t of\nSocial Services, 436 U.S. 658, 694 (1978).  To hold the municipality liable, a plaintiff\nmust demonstrate that the official policy “evidences ‘a deliberate indifference’ to his\nconstitutional rights,” and caused his injury.  See Oviatt v. Pearce, 954 F.2d 1470, 1474\n(9th Cir. 1992) (quoting City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 389-91 (1989)). \nPlaintiffs allege that the City’s failure to implement policies to ensure the rights of\ndemonstrators, given the City’s obligations under the NLG and Crespo settlements, arises\nto a municipal policy or custom of deliberate indifference to the First Amendment rights\nof the public.  The elements of Plaintiffs’ Monell claim rely on proof involving the City\nof Los Angeles’s policies and practices, and will not require facts individual to each class\nmember’s claims.\nFor an employer to be liable for an assault or other intentional tort, the tort must\nhave a causal nexus to the employee’s work.  Lisa M. v. Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial\nHospital, 12 Cal.4th 291, 297 (1995).  Here, for the most part whether the actions of the\nindividual police officers have the requisite causal nexus will be a common question,\nbecause the police officers had been assigned to crowd control for the event and most\nincidents of use of force occurred as a result of the command decisions.\n2. Rule 23(b)(3) factor two: Class treatment is a superior method of\nadjudication.\nRule 23(b)(3) specifies four nonexclusive factors that are “pertinent” to a\ndetermination of whether class certification is the superior method.  Fed. R. Civ. P.\n23(b)(3).  They are: (A) the interest of members of the class in individually controlling\nthe prosecution or defense of separate actions; (B) the extent and nature of any litigation\nconcerning the controversy already commenced by or against members of the class; (C)\nthe desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the\nparticular forum; (D) the difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a\nclass action.  Id.  Courts have discretion under Rule 23 to decline to certify a class action\nCV-90 (06/04) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 22 of 25\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 40      Filed 12/14/2007     Page 23 of 25\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. CV 07-3072 AHM (FMOx) Date December 14, 2007\nTitle MULTI-ETHNIC IMMIGRANT WORKERS ORGANIZING NETWORK, et al. v.\nCITY OF LOS ANGELES, et al.\nwhen it would bring about “undesirable results.”  Advisory Committee Notes, 39 F.R.D.\n69, 103.\n(a) The interests of class members in individually controlling separate\nactions and the extent and nature of litigation already commenced.\nDefendants argue that class members’ individual damages are not small, that they\nhave an emotional stake in the litigation and that they will therefore want to individually\nprosecute the action.  Defendants further claim there is a likelihood of more opt-outs than\nclass members.  Defendants provide little support for this argument.  Of the more than\n6,000 people in the damages class, 300 or so have filed claims (individually or in a\ngroup) against the City.  Thirteen lawsuits are currently pending: six before this Court\nand seven in state court.   MIWON counsel claims to represent over 176 claimants who\nhave agreed to be a part of the class action.  Realistically, the only people who may\nchoose to opt out are those who are prosecuting their own lawsuits in federal or state\ncourt.  Whatever the number, they will represent a small minority of claimants.  In any\nevent, the fact that some class members may wish to opt out does not lead to the\nconclusion that a class action is inappropriate, because it is their right under Rule\n23(b)(3) and not uncommon in large class actions.\n(b) The desirability of concentrating the action.\nThis factor favors class certification because all claims arise from same location,\ndate, and time period.  FAC ¶ 87.  The Court is amenable to coordinating the federal\ncases with those in state court.\n(c) Manageability.\nPlaintiffs have anticipated many of the management concerns the Court might\nhave.  A number of management tools are available to addressed individualized damages\nissues, such as bifurcating liability and damages trials, appointing a magistrate judge or\nspecial master to preside over damages proceedings, and creating subclasses as permitted\nunder Rule 23(c)(4).  Plaintiffs note that damages may be assessed class-wide based on a\nformula or through test trials.  Plaintiffs also have contemplated various methods of\nproviding the best notice practicable.  See FAC ¶ 89.  In general, their proposals and the\nCourt’s willingness to consider other proposals dispel any real concerns about\nCV-90 (06/04) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 23 of 25\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 40      Filed 12/14/2007     Page 24 of 25\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. CV 07-3072 AHM (FMOx) Date December 14, 2007\nTitle MULTI-ETHNIC IMMIGRANT WORKERS ORGANIZING NETWORK, et al. v.\nCITY OF LOS ANGELES, et al.\nmanageability.\n(d) General appropriateness.\nRule 23(b)(3) classes certified in mass demonstration cases are not new.  See \nVodak v. City of Chicago, 2006 WL 1037151 at *1, *6 ( (N.D. Ill. 2006) (protesters were\ndetained, arrested, and/or charged); Hickey v. City of Seattle, 236 F.R.D. 659, 660-61,\n664-67 (W.D. Wash. 2006) (protesters were surrounded by police in a “no protest zone”\nand arrested).  Vietnam War protests in Washington D.C. also gave rise to a prominent\nRule 23(b)(3) class action.  See Dellums v. Powell, 566 F.2d 167, 174 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (a\nclass consisting of “all persons who were arrested while assembled on the Capitol steps\non May 5, 1971).  But see McCarthy v. Kleindienst, 741 F.2d 1406, 1415 n. 11 (D.C. Cir.\n1984) (deferring to district court’s denial of class certification and noting that “Dellums\nconsisted only of those persons arrested on the steps of the U.S. Capitol, a much more\ncohesive group than the approximately 7,000 putative class members here who were\narrested throughout the city.”).  Courts have also certified Rule 23(b)(3) classes in\ncontexts analogous to mass demonstrations.  See, e.g., Tardiff v. Knox County, 365 F.3d\n1, 6-7 (1st Cir. 2004) (strip searches of pre-arraignment jail detainees); Williams v.\nBrown, 214 F.R.D. 484, 485 (N.D. Ill. 2003) (detention and searches of neighborhood\nresidents during a basketball tournament); Doe v. Calumet City, Illinois, 754 F.Supp.\n1211, 1212 (N.D. Ill. 1990) (strip searches of female arrestees).  \nIt bears emphasizing that the primary policy of the class action mechanism is to\nenable the collective vindication of the rights of numerous persons whose claims are not\nworth litigating in individual actions.  See Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591,\n617 (1997).  As Plaintiffs point out, this rationale is particularly applicable here, where\nsome class members may feel hesitant about coming forward on their own because they\nmay be (or were at the time) in this country unlawfully.  Cf. Patrykus v. Gomilla, 121\nF.R.D. 357, 361 (N.D. Ill. 1988) (certifying a class of 50 patrons of gay bars who were\nharassed and arrested by police, taking into consideration the potential social prejudice\nagainst homosexuals that may deter class members from suing in their own names).\n/ / /\nCV-90 (06/04) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 24 of 25\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 40      Filed 12/14/2007     Page 25 of 25\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. CV 07-3072 AHM (FMOx) Date December 14, 2007\nTitle MULTI-ETHNIC IMMIGRANT WORKERS ORGANIZING NETWORK, et al. v.\nCITY OF LOS ANGELES, et al.\nV.

INTRODUCTION \n2 This lawsuit having come before this Court for a hearing, pursuant to this \n3 Court's Preliminary Approval Order dated March 14, 2009 (the \"Preliminary \n4 Approval Order”) to consider and determine the matters set forth in the \n5 Preliminary Approval Order; and due notice of said hearing having been published \nand given; and all persons that made timely objections to the proposed settlement \n6\nset forth in the Settlement Agreement, and described in the Class Notice, having \n7\nbeen given an opportunity to present such objections to the Court; and the Court \n8\nhaving considered the matter, including all papers filed in connection therewith, \n9\nand the oral presentations of counsel at said hearing; and good cause appearing, \n10\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED THAT: \n11\nII. DEFINITIONS \n12\n1.

A “Structural Relief Class Member” means any class member meeting \n2 the following definition (as set forth in the Class Certification Order of January 8, \n3 2008):  \n4 “Those who in the past have engaged in or who in the future may \n5 engage in peaceful demonstrations or protest in the City of Los Angeles and \nwho, at the time they engage in such peaceful demonstrations or protest, were \n6\nor are: \n7\n“(a) The following organizations: Multi-Ethnic Immigrant Workers \n8\nOrganizing Network, Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los \n9\nAngeles, Koreatown Immigrant Workers Alliance, Institute for Popular \n10\nEducation of Southern California, Pilipino Workers Center, Garment Workers \n11\nCenter (“Plaintiff Associations”); \n12\n“(b) Officers, representatives, or members of Plaintiff Associations; \n13\n“(c) Persons who attend or participate in Plaintiff Associations' events, \n14\nincluding but not limited to their rallies; \n15\n“(d) Organizations that advocate, organize, or both advocate and \n16\norganize on behalf of the rights of individuals and associations to engage in \n17\nspeech, assembly, and expression within the scope of the First Amendment of \n18\nthe United States Constitution. \n19\n“(e) Persons who participate in public assemblies organized by the \n20\norganizations described in paragraph (d).” \n21\n5.  A “Represented Individual” is an individual class member who has \n22\nbeen represented individually and as a class member in either the above-captioned \n23\nMIWON case, or in any of the following Related Cases: \n24\nRELATED CASES  NUMBER  PLAINTFF’S ATTORNEY\n25 Santiago v.

City of Los Angeles  2:08 CV-02710 Leo Hernandez \n \n6\nThe names of, and counsel for, the Represented Individuals are set forth in \n7\nExhibit E to the Preliminary Approval Order.  \n8\nThe term “Represented Individuals” in the plural refers collectively to all the \n9\nRepresented Individuals in the MIWON and above listed cases. \n10\n6.  An “Unrepresented Class Member” is a class member not currently \n11\nrepresented by any of the counsel in MIWON or the Related Cases, i.e., a class \n12\nmember who is not a “Represented Individual” as defined in Paragraph 5. \n13\n7.  “Class Counsel” means Barrett S. Litt, Litt, Estuar, Harrison & \n14\nKitson, 1055 Wilshire Blvd., #1880, Los Angeles CA. 90017; Carol A. Sobel, 429 \n15\nSanta Monica Boulevard, Suite 550, Santa Monica, California 90401; and Paul L. \n16\nHoffman, 723 Ocean Front Walk, Venice, California 90291. \n17\n8.   “Matters Alleged in the Lawsuit” refers to claims for relief and \n18\nallegations in the MIWON Complaint dated May 9, 2007, as well as claims for \n19\nrelief and allegations in the operative complaints filed in the Related Cases, all of \n20\nwhich are based upon actions of the LAPD or its personnel for allegedly violating \n21\nFirst or Fourth Amendment rights, as well as other federal and state-law rights, in \n22\nor surrounding MacArthur Park on May 1, 2007.  \n23\n9.   “Released Persons” means the Defendants and their affiliates, \n24\nsubsidiaries, predecessors, successors, and/or assigns, together with past, present \n25\nand future officials, employees, representatives, attorneys, and/or agents.  \n26 10.   “LAPD” refers to the Los Angeles Police Department. \n27 11.  “Class Notice” means the notice in a form substantially similar to that \n28 attached to the Preliminary Approval Order as Exhibit B. \n  3 \n \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 107      Filed 06/23/2009     Page 7 of 24\n   \n1 12.  “Effective Date” means the date upon which this Consent Judgment \n2 becomes final.  Unless the Court entertains the one objection to the settlement that \n3 was filed, see Paragraph 21, infra, then the Consent Judgment becomes final at the \n4 time of its entry.  If the Court entertains and overrules the objection, then the \n5 Consent Judgment will be deemed final only upon expiration of the time for the \nobjector to appeal or, if a Notice of Appeal is filed, upon exhaustion of all the \n6\nobjector’s appeals and petitions for writs of certiorari. \n7\n13.  An “Opt-Out” is any Unrepresented Class Member who files with the \n8\nAdministrator a timely request for exclusion from the Settlement Agreement.   \n9\n14.  “Proof of Claim Form” means the Proof of Claim and Release Form \n10\nthat Unrepresented Class Members must use to make a claim for payment from the \n11\nPost Administration Class Fund, as that term is defined in Paragraph 16, infra.  A \n12\ncopy of the proposed Proof of Claim Form is attached to the Preliminary Approval \n13\nOrder as the last page of Exhibit B thereto. \n14\n15.  The “Class Fund” is the monetary fund set aside for Unrepresented \n15\nClass Members who filed timely class claims. The Class Fund amounts to \n16\n$250,000 inclusive of all costs of class administration.  \n17\n16.  The “Post Administration Class Fund” is the Class Fund less costs of \n18\nclass administration.  \n19\n17.  The “Represented Individuals’ Fund” encompasses all funds owed to \n20\nthe Represented Individuals under the Settlement Agreement.  The Represented \n21\nIndividuals’ Fund amounts to $12,550,000, inclusive of all attorneys’ fees, \n22\nmedical liens and costs.  The amount of $12,600,000 referenced in the Settlement \n23\nAgreement has been reduced by agreement of the parties in light of Plaintiff \n24\nAntonio Lopez’ decision to withdraw from the settlement.   \n25\n18.  The “Class Attorneys’ Fees” are the attorneys’ fees the MIWON \n26\nPlaintiffs have moved the Court to award Class Counsel and the MIWON counsel \n27 team in the total amount $3,753,000, inclusive of all MIWON-related litigation \n28 costs, medical liens and medical costs.  Class Attorneys’ Fees encompass some \n  4 \n \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 107      Filed 06/23/2009     Page 8 of 24\n   \n1 additional sums allocated to non-MIWON counsel, sums agreed to between \n2 MIWON counsel and non-MIWON counsel and in turn individually addressed \n3 between non-MIWON counsel and their clients.  These fees are all based on both a \n4 statutory and class fund fee award available on both the federal and state claims \n5 brought in this case.  Class Attorneys’ Fees do not in any way increase the total \nsettlement amount owed by the City, or impose any payment obligation on any \n6\nother Defendant or Released Person.   \n7\n19.  The “Claim Cut-Off Date” of May 27, 2009, is the date by which any \n8\nUnrepresented Class Member who wishes to receive payment from the Post \n9\nAdministration Class Fund was required to file his/her Proof of Claim Form.  \n10\n20.  The “Bar Date,” which is April 27, 2009, is the date by which any \n11\nclass member was required to file objections, if any, to the Settlement Agreement, \n12\nor any class member was required to request exclusion from the settlement.  A \n13\nRepresented Individual was required to request exclusion from the settlement by \n14\neither failing to provide his/her counsel with a signed authorization or by \n15\nproviding written notice to the Court and parties of his/her intent to exclude \n16\nhimself or herself, in either case no later than the Bar Date.  \n17\nIII.  OBJECTIONS  \n18\n21.  There has been one objection to the settlement, and no separate \n19\nobjection to the Motion for an award of attorneys’ fees. The one filed objection is \n20\nattached as Exhibit 1 hereto. It provides no information whatsoever as to the \n21\nground for the objection; instead, it merely objects to the settlement, stating, \n22\n“Objection to settlement in MIWON” etc., and nothing more. Accordingly, the \n23\nCourt concludes that the objection must be overruled as there is no substance \n24\nprovided permitting the Court to assess its merits.  The Court finds the settlement, \n25\nbased on all available evidence, to be fair, reasonable and adequate, and in the best \n26\ninterests of the class.  \n27 IV.  OPT OUTS \n28 22.  There have been no opt-out notices filed by Unrepresented Class \n  5 \n \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 107      Filed 06/23/2009     Page 9 of 24\n   \n1 Members. Among the Represented Individuals, one – Antonio Lopez, represented \n2 by Luis Carrillo –  has withdrawn from the settlement. The parties negotiated how \n3 that affects the settlement and agreed that Mr. Lopez would not be part of the \n4 settlement and would be treated as an Opt-Out. In consideration of the fact that the \n5 City will now have to litigate with Mr. Lopez, the Represented Individuals’ Fund \noriginally set at $12,600,000 was reduced by $50,000. Except for Mr. Lopez, all \n6\nclass members, including all Represented Individuals, are bound by the terms of \n7\nthis Consent Judgment and the settlement in this case. \n8\nV.  CLAIMS FILED. \n9\n23.  The claims filing postmark deadline for the Class Fund was on May \n10\n27, 2009. As of June 11, 2009, the Administrator has received 1324 timely Proof \n11\nof Claim Forms and 46 late Proof of Claim Forms. The processing of Proof of \n12\nClaims Forms has not been completed. \n13\n24.  Proof of Claim Forms received or postmarked by May 27, 2009, shall \n14\nbe paid. The Court will not allow late claims to be considered and paid. \n15\nVI.  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT APPROVED BECAUSE FAIR, \n16\nADEQUATE, AND REASONABLE. \n17\n25.  The settlement of this lawsuit was not the product of collusion \n18\nbetween Plaintiffs and Defendants or their respective counsel, but rather was the \n19\nresult of bona fide and arm’s-length negotiation conducted in good faith by the \n20\nparties and their counsel, with the assistance of an independent mediator, who is a \n21\nsitting United States Magistrate Judge. \n22\n26.  The Settlement Agreement and the settlement set forth therein are \n23\nhereby approved and found to be fair, adequate, reasonable, in the best interest of \n24\nthe Class as a whole, and in satisfaction of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil \n25\nProcedure and due process requirements. The Court previously certified an \n26\ninjunctive relief class and damages class after a contested motion, and re-affirms \n27 that certification. \n28\n  6 \n \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 107      Filed 06/23/2009     Page 10 of 24\n   \n1 VII.  DISTINCTION BETWEEN REPRESENTED INDIVIDUALS AND \n2 UNREPRESENTED CLASS MEMBERS \n3 27.  The Court is aware that the parties have settled this case as a hybrid \n4 settlement. The MIWON counsel represented both the certified class and 192 \n5 individual class members who alleged they had been injured as a result of the \nactions of the LAPD on May 1, 2007. In addition, the cases listed in Paragraph 5, \n6\nsupra, represent a combined additional 105 individuals who also alleged they had \n7\nbeen injured as a result of the actions of the LAPD on May 1, 2007. These are \n8\ncollectively the “Represented Individuals” as defined above.  Each of the \n9\nRepresented Individuals is to receive the same amount of compensation as every \n10\nother Represented Individual with similar injuries, but no additional damages have \n11\nbeen awarded based on an individual’s role as a class representative.  The Court is \n12\nalso aware that the Represented Individuals are receiving significantly higher \n13\namounts than are the Unrepresented Class Members. The Court finds this \n14\ndistinction appropriate under the unique circumstances of this case for the \n15\nfollowing reasons: \n16\nA. In the mediation process, the plaintiffs presented evidence that the \n17\nRepresented Individuals were in fact present at the events in question \n18\nthrough individualized analysis of witness statement, photographs and \n19\nthe like, which is not the case for the Unrepresented Class Members. \n20\nB. In the mediation process, the plaintiffs presented evidence of the \n21\nparticular circumstances of each Represented Individual, and all parties \n22\nwere able to assess damages for those individuals, which is not the case \n23\nfor the Unrepresented Class Members. \n24\nC. Plaintiffs presented evidence in the mediation process indicating that \n25\nmost of the Represented Individuals suffered significant physical and \n26\npsychological injuries. \n27\nD. It is the assessment of the parties, and the Court concurs, that most of \n28 those who suffered serious injuries as a result of the Matters Alleged in \n  7 \n \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 107      Filed 06/23/2009     Page 11 of 24\n   \n1 the Lawsuit were included among the Represented Individuals, especially \n2 in light of the widespread publicity about the events and the ensuing \n3 lawsuits. \n4 E. The City’s offer to settle the case in the amount it did was driven almost \n5 exclusively by its assessment of the Represented Individuals’ claims. It \nwas Class Counsel who insisted that the Class Fund be established for \n6\nthose who qualify as Damages Class Members and were not Represented \n7\nIndividuals. \n8\nF. The Class Fund established in this settlement is designed to compensate \n9\nDamages Class Members who did not receive serious injuries. If there are \n10\na few who did, they had the right to opt out of the settlement. The fact \n11\nthat there were no Opt-Outs and only one general objection (by an \n12\nindividual who provided no information establishing that she qualified as \n13\na class member) confirms that the Represented Individuals included all, \n14\nor virtually all, those with the more serious generally. \n15\nVIII. CLASS NOTICE \n16\n28.  As required by this Court in its Preliminary Approval Order: (a) Class \n17\nNotices were distributed by five Plaintiff Associations to inform as many \n18\nindividuals as was practicable of the settlement and the claims process; and (b) \n19\nClass Notice was published in a summary fashion as set forth in the Settlement \n20\nAgreement and in the Preliminary Approval Order. See Declaration of the Claims \n21\nAdministrator, and Supporting Declarations Re Outreach. The evidence provided \n22\nto the Court of the outreach efforts reflects an exceptionally successful outreach, \n23\nincluding email, hand-outs, and other distribution efforts by the organizations that \n24\ncomprise MIWON. See Declaration of Carol Sobel summarizing outreach effort. \n25\nIn light of the fact that no individual names and addresses of attendees of the May \n26\n1, 2007, activities exist, this effort was both impressive and successful. Between \n27\nthe Represented Individuals and the class members filing timely claims, \n28 approximately 25% of those present at the protest have come forward. This is an \n  8 \n \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 107      Filed 06/23/2009     Page 12 of 24\n   \n1 excellent result given returns in comparable cases. See Declaration of Barrett S. \n2 Litt regarding claims returns in other cases.  \n3 29.  The notice given to the Unrepresented Class Members is hereby \n4 determined to be fully in compliance with the notice requirements of Rule 23 of \n5 the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and due process and is found to be the best \nnotice practicable under the circumstances and to constitute due and sufficient \n6\nnotice to all parties entitled thereto. \n7\n30.  Due and adequate notice of the proceedings having been given, and a \n8\nfull opportunity having been offered to class members to participate in this \n9\nhearing, it is hereby determined that all class members, except Antonio Lopez (a \n10\nRepresented Individual, who is the sole Opt-Out), are bound by this Consent \n11\nJudgment. \n12\nIX.  CLASS-WIDE PROSPECTIVE RELIEF  \n13\n31.  The Court has entered a separate Structural Relief Order addressing \n14\nclass-wide prospective relief and retaining jurisdiction to enforce the terms of that \n15\norder for a period of no less than four (4) years.  A copy of this Structural Relief \n16\norder is attached as Exhibit 2 to this Consent Judgment and incorporated as though \n17\nfully set forth herein. \n18\nX.  DAMAGES SETTLEMENT  \n19\n32.  $12,550,000 of the total settlement of $12,800,000 shall go to cover \n20\nthe claims of the Represented Individuals, including statutory attorneys’ fees, costs \n21\nand any outstanding liens. Counsel for the MIWON Represented Individuals and \n22\ncounsel for the other Represented Individuals have agreed among themselves as to \n23\nhow much money will be provided to each of the Represented Individuals. \n24\nCounsel for the MIWON Represented Individuals and counsel for the other \n25\nRepresented Individuals have also agreed among themselves how any Class \n26\nAttorney’s Fees will be distributed among counsel. In addition, in the case of non-\n27\nMIWON Represented Individuals, they may have agreements with their counsel \n28 regarding percentage division of their settlements. The amount of attorneys’ fees \n  9 \n \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 107      Filed 06/23/2009     Page 13 of 24\n   \n1 and costs approved by the Court is addressed in Paragraph 49 below. \n2 33.  The Settlement Agreement provides for a total of $12,600,000 (now \n3 reduced to $12,550,000 as a result of Mr. Lopez’s withdrawal), whether via direct \n4 payment or structured settlement, to be paid to the 297 (now 296 as a result of Mr. \n5 Lopez’s withdrawal) Represented Individuals and a residual Class Fund of \n$250,000 (inclusive of costs of class administration). The Plaintiffs’ counsel who \n6\nare signatories to the Settlement Agreement (Exhibit A to the Preliminary \n7\nApproval Order) have warranted 1) that they have authority from each \n8\nRepresented Individual whom they represent individually to settle the cases on the \n9\nterms set forth herein, 2) that each of their clients is aware of and has authorized \n10\nthe amount each will receive from the settlement, and 3) that each of their clients \n11\nare aware of and has approved the attorneys’ fee arrangement between counsel and \n12\nclient.  \n13\n34.  There will be one structured settlement for one of the MIWON clients, \n14\nLuis Galvez, the particulars of which are currently being worked out. For that \n15\nstructured settlement to occur, the final structured settlement papers must be \n16\nsigned by all relevant parties before the payment of the settlement funds to the \n17\nvarious attorney client trust accounts, as set forth in Paragraph 35. In the event the \n18\nGalvez structured settlement occurs, the cost of that structure shall be deducted \n19\nfrom the amount of funds to be paid to the Litt, Estuar, Harrison & Kitson Client \n20\nTrust Account as set forth in Paragraph 35. \n21\n35.  Payment of the total $12,800,000 settlement amount shall be the \n22\nobligation of the City and no other Defendant or person. The City intends to use \n23\nthe proceeds from one or more Judgment Obligation Bonds (hereafter the \n24\n“Judgment Bond”) to fund this Consent Judgment. The City will deposit the funds \n25\nrequired under the Settlement Agreement and Consent Judgment forthwith after it \n26\nreceives the proceeds of the sale of the Judgment Bond, the purpose of such sale \n27\nbeing to fund the instant settlement.  The parties will use their best efforts to \n28 facilitate receipt of such funds within 120 days of the Effective Date. If, after six \n  10 \n \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 107      Filed 06/23/2009     Page 14 of 24\n   \n1 months from the Effective Date, the Judgment Bond has not been sold, the City \n2 will provide a report to the Court and Class Counsel regarding how it plans to fund \n3 the settlement. The failure or inability of the City to sell the Judgment Bond shall \n4 not be cause for the City to rescind the Settlement Agreement. The Consent \n5 Judgment is a final non-appealable judgment, collectible under the same legal \nstandard as any final judgment in federal court that has not been appealed. \n6\nForthwith after the settlement funds are collected from the sale of the judgment \n7\nbond, or otherwise pursuant to further order of court, all settlement funds shall be \n8\ndeposited into the Litt, Estuar, Harrison & Kitson Client Trust Account, and from \n9\nthere shall be distributed by wire to the trust accounts of the counsel in each of the \n10\nRelated Cases as agreed to among the parties, and from each respective trust \n11\naccount shall be distributed to the clients or counsel, as has been agreed to among \n12\nthe parties and counsel.  (The MIWON counsel will determine among themselves \n13\nhow to distribute the funds to the Represented Individuals they represent.) The \n14\namounts to go to the MIWON and non-MIWON client trust accounts (inclusive of \n15\ntheir proportionate share of the awarded attorney’s fees) is as follows: \n16\nA.  Gregory Yates: $525,000 \n17\nB.  Ellen Ellison: $40,000 \n18\nC.  Susan Pintar: $530,000 \n19\nD.  Luis Carrillo: $2,040,000 (having been reduced by $50,000 to    \n20\naccount for Antonio Lopez’s withdrawal from the settlement) \n21\nE.  Louis Krass1: $50,000 \n22\nF.  Carl Douglas: $352,000 \n23\nG.  Leo Hernandez: $38,000 \n24\n25\n26                                            \n27 1 If Mr. Krass, or any other non-MIWON counsel, is properly replaced on the \nrecord by new counsel, then the funds shall be paid to the trust account of whoever \n28\nis the current counsel of record. \n  11 \n \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 107      Filed 06/23/2009     Page 15 of 24\n   \n1 H.  Jaime Segall-Gutierrez: $241,000.  At an earlier stage in the \n2 case, Mr. Segall-Gutierrez represented the following \n3 individuals: Summer Reese, for herself and as guardian for her \n4 minor child Patrick Reese; Geneva Reese; Ed Cotton; Pedro \n5 Reyes; Tania Torres; Miguel Guzman; and Nadia Khan.  Those \nindividuals are no longer represented by Mr. Segall-Gutierrez, \n6\nand they will be paid directly from the Litt, Estuar, et al. Client \n7\nTrust Account their portion of the settlement. \n8\nI.  Litt, Estuar, et al. (for MIWON clients and counsel, and \n9\ninclusive of the $200,000 Post Administration Class Fund): \n10\n$8,934,000. \n11\n36.  Each class member not listed in Exhibit E to the Preliminary Approval \n12\nOrder who filed a timely, valid claim form shall be paid his or her proportional \n13\nshare of the Post Administration Class Fund. If all the claims timely filed were \n14\npaid, there would be $200,000 divided by 1324 claim forms, or slightly above \n15\n$150 per claimant.  \n16\nXI.  HANDLING OF MINORS’ CLAIMS FOR REPRESENTED \n17\nINDIVIDUALS \n18\n37.  Included among the Represented Individuals are minors, some of \n19\nwhose settlements are $6000 or less and some of whose settlements exceed $6000. \n20\nFor those minors who receive, exclusive of attorneys’ fees and costs, settlements \n21\nof $6000 or less, blocked accounts need not be opened, and the money shall be \n22\npaid to the parents or guardian ad litem of the minor for general use for the \n23\nminor’s health and well-being in whatever manner the parent or guardian sees fit. \n24\nFor those minors who receive, exclusive of attorneys’ fees and costs, settlements \n25\nover $6000, blocked interest bearing bank accounts shall be opened for those who \n26\nwill not reach the age of 16 by December 31, 2009. For those minors who will \n27\nreach the age of 16 by December 31, 2009, and who receive, exclusive of \n28 attorneys’ fees and costs, settlements over $6000, their funds shall be maintained \n  12 \n \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 107      Filed 06/23/2009     Page 16 of 24\n   \n1 in their individual counsel’s client trust account so that they can be expeditiously \n2 paid to the client at the time of his/her 18th birthday. The names and categories of \n3 minors addressed by this and the next two paragraphs are listed in Exhibit 3 to this \n4 Consent Judgment. A record of each blocked account – which includes the \n5 minor’s name, date of birth, parent’s or guardian’s name, and current address; and \nthe name and branch of the bank in which the account is opened and the account \n6\nnumber –  must be filed with the Court within 90 days from the initial payment of \n7\nfunds into the Litt, Estuar, et al. Client Trust Account. \n8\n38.  The Court recognizes that there may be circumstances in which a \n9\nparent or other guardian has a need for the funds in a blocked account for the \n10\ndirect and immediate benefit of the minor plaintiff, such as for a medical \n11\nemergency or braces. The Court authorizes the withdrawal of funds from the \n12\nblocked account for such a purpose with the written concurrence of the counsel for \n13\nthat minor listed in Exhibit 3 to this Consent Judgment. The written concurrence \n14\nshall memorialize the reasons for the withdrawal, and a copy shall be filed with \n15\nthe financial institution where the funds are maintained, which shall keep such \n16\nrecord until the minor reaches maturity and withdraws the funds. The maximum \n17\nallowed number of such withdrawals is two.  \n18\n39.  In that regard, the Court authorizes the use of $5000 for minor \n19\nplaintiff NZ (whose GAL is Maria Guadalupe Gonzales) to pay for orthodonture \n20\nwithout further order of Court or approval of counsel. \n21\nXII.  HANDLING OF ABSENT REPRESENTED INDIVIDUALS’ CLAIMS \n22\n40.  There are Represented Individuals whose present whereabouts are \n23\nunknown (“Missing Represented Individuals”). Plaintiffs’ counsel have ranked \n24\nMissing Represented Individuals’ settlement within the grid system utilized for the \n25\nRepresented Individuals, but are unable to secure the consent of the Missing \n26\nRepresented Individuals to the settlement. The names of the Missing Represented \n27\nIndividuals, the amounts of their settlement after attorneys’ fees and costs, as \n28 determined by the counsel whom they retained, and the names of their counsel, are \n  13 \n \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 107      Filed 06/23/2009     Page 17 of 24\n   \n1 contained in Exhibit 4. \n2 41.  The Court finds that Plaintiffs’ counsel made diligent efforts to locate \n3 the Missing Represented Individuals, which efforts were unsuccessful. These \n4 efforts included calling, mailing and trying to make personal contact. See \n5 Declarations of Carol Sobel, Jorge Gonzalez, Colleen Flynn, Do Kim and Luis \nCarrillo in Support of Exhibit 4 Re Missing Clients. \n6\n42.  Plaintiffs request that the Court authorize that the funds designated for \n7\nthe Missing Represented Individuals set forth in Exhibit 4 be placed in a special \n8\ntrust account because the Court has jurisdiction over, and the authority to bind, \n9\nany class member who has not opted out, and none of the Missing Represented \n10\nIndividuals has opted out. \n11\n43.  Class members must be adequately represented by Class Counsel and \n12\nafforded due process in order to be bound by a class settlement or judgment. Thus, \n13\nin class actions, personal jurisdiction for judgment purposes may be exercised over \n14\nnonresident class members, even those without minimum contacts with the forum, \n15\nand without affirmative opt-in consent having been made, so long as there has \n16\nbeen the best notice practicable under the circumstances, and an opportunity for \n17\nclass members to exclude themselves from the litigation. Phillips Petroleum Co. v. \n18\nShutts, 472 U.S. 797, 808 (1985). The Court finds that such due process \n19\nrequirements have been met here, and that it accordingly may bind even those \n20\nindividuals who are individual plaintiffs who are now absent if they have not \n21\nopted out. Accordingly, the Court concludes that Class Counsel’s proposal is \n22\nproper. \n23\n44.  This is especially so because, without the Court approving the \n24\nsettlement for the Missing Represented Individuals, the Missing Represented \n25\nIndividuals, if they are named parties, would be subject to a motion for dismissal \n26\nwith prejudice for failure to prosecute their case, under F.R.Civ.P. Rule 41(b). See, \n27\ne.g., Henderson v. Duncan, 779 F.2d 1421, 1423 (9th Cir.1986) (in ruling on a \n28 motion under Rule 41(b), the Court considers several factors, including, “(1) the \n  14 \n \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 107      Filed 06/23/2009     Page 18 of 24\n   \n1 public's interest in expeditious resolution of litigation; (2) the court's need to \n2 manage its docket; (3) the risk of prejudice to the defendants; (4) the public policy \n3 favoring disposition of cases on their merits and (5) the availability of less drastic \n4 sanctions”); Aziz v. Wright, 34 F.3d 587 (8th Cir. 1994) (plaintiff twice appeared \n5 for deposition but refused each time to be deposed; case properly dismissed for \nfailure to prosecute after court ordered plaintiff to be deposed and he failed to \n6\ncomply). If they were not named parties, they would be bound by the settlement \n7\neven though they were receiving no funds. \n8\n45.  The Court finds that it is in the interest of the Missing Represented \n9\nIndividuals, and of the class as a whole, to include the Missing Represented \n10\nIndividuals in the settlement on the terms proposed, and that it has the authority to \n11\ndo so in the context of this class action without the approval of the Missing \n12\nRepresented Individuals. Accordingly, Class Counsel shall open special interest \n13\nbearing trust accounts for each such client. If any Missing Represented Individual \n14\nhas not claimed his/her funds by December 31, 2012, then the funds in the account \n15\nfor such individual shall revert to the City. Counsel for any Missing Represented \n16\nIndividual who opens a trust account pursuant to this paragraph shall, at the time \n17\nthe trust account is opened, provide the financial institution holding the funds \n18\nwritten notice of the City’s reversionary right and all instructions necessary to \n19\nfacilitate such reversion on January 2, 2013. Counsel for any Missing Represented \n20\nIndividual shall also give the City written notice, addressed to Cory Brente of the \n21\nLos Angeles City Attorney’s Police Litigations Section, of the financial \n22\ninstitution(s) in which any such account has been opened so that the City may take \n23\nsteps to exercise its reversionary rights at the appropriate time.  It shall then be the \n24\nresponsibility of the City to initiate the reversionary process and contact any \n25\nholders of the trust accounts necessary to accomplish the reversion, with which \n26\nprocess all Plaintiffs’ counsel shall cooperate. Despite the provisions of this \n27\nparagraph or any other paragraph herein, between January 1, 2013, and December \n28 31, 2018, each Missing Represented Individual shall retain the right to receive \n  15 \n \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 107      Filed 06/23/2009     Page 19 of 24\n   \n1 from the City (and no other person) the amount of net principal and accrued \n2 interest, if any, that was in the trust account at the time the City received funds \n3 from it; provided, however, that said Missing Individual shall not be entitled to \n4 receive interest accrued after December 31, 2012, if any. The names, settlement \n5 amounts, and counsel for the Missing Represented Individuals are provided in \nExhibit 4. \n6\n46.  The Missing Represented Individuals will be bound by this Consent \n7\nJudgment in the same manner as any other class member who has not opted out. \n8\nXIII. CLASS FUND ATTORNEYS’ FEES \n9\n47.  Plaintiffs have filed a Motion for Attorneys’ Fees requesting payment \n10\nof $3,753,000 in attorneys’ fees including litigation costs and medical liens and \n11\ncosts. The Court approves this request and is entering a separate order addressing \n12\nit. \n13\n48.  The Court is also advised that, pursuant to contract terms between \n14\nattorney and client, some of the non-MIWON attorneys – but not the MIWON \n15\ncounsel – may receive a percentage of the client’s recovery, as negotiated between \n16\nattorney and client. Since these agreements are in the non-MIWON cases, they do \n17\nnot require court approval. \n18\nXIV. CLASS ADMINISTRATOR \n19\n49.  The Court reaffirms the appointment of Gilardi & Co., LLC as \n20\nAdministrator. The Court authorizes the payment, to be made immediately from \n21\nthe Litt, Estuar, et al. Client Trust Account, of $30,617.80 to cover the \n22\nAdministrator’s expenses to date. The Class Administrator estimates an additional \n23\n$11,315 or possibly more to complete the claims administration (excluding \n24\nparticular efforts that may be requested by the City at its expense), for which the \n25\nCourt authorizes payment upon completion. When and if the class distribution \n26\ngoes forward (i.e., if there is no appeal or there is an appeal and the settlement is \n27\napproved at the appellate level or abandoned), then Gilardi & Co. LLC will \n28 receive an additional $200,000 to distribute to class members as part of the class \n  16 \n \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 107      Filed 06/23/2009     Page 20 of 24\n   \n1 fund. \n2 50.  The Administrator shall preserve all written communications from \n3 class members at least until December 31, 2012, or pursuant to further order of the \n4 Court. All written communications received by the Administrator from class \n5 members relating to the settlement shall be available at all reasonable times for \ninspection and copying by counsel for the parties. \n6\n51.  In addition to the Administrator, work to distribute the Class Notices \n7\nwas performed by the Plaintiff Organizations, each of which has filed a \n8\ndeclaration attesting to their outreach efforts. The Court authorizes payment of up \n9\nto $20,000, at $40 per hour, for these efforts by Plaintiff Organizations.   \n10\n52.  Based on the foregoing figures, the Court is aware that the cost of \n11\nadministration will exceed the original estimate of $50,000. MIWON counsel has \n12\nadvised the Court that they have succeeded in reducing some of the liens for their \n13\nclients, and that they estimate that the total savings will be somewhere between \n14\n$50,000 and $100,000. These lien funds are part of the total $3,753,000 requested \n15\nby MIWON counsel. MIWON counsel have further advised the Court that, under \n16\ntheir arrangements with their clients, each client is to receive a specified amount, \n17\nand counsel assumed responsibility for the liens. Since the amount to be paid to \n18\nMIWON counsel is less than their lodestar, the Court approves that any sums \n19\nsaved by the reduction of liens shall be deemed fees to the MIWON counsel, \n20\nexcept that from that reduction, MIWON counsel shall pay the additional class \n21\nadministrative costs so that the funds available for distribution to Unrepresented \n22\nClass Members remains $200,000.   \n23\nXV.  GENERAL PROVISIONS \n24\n53.  All class members except those who timely filed opt-out forms shall \n25\nbe bound by this Consent Judgment. \n26\n54.  Except as otherwise provided in this Consent Judgment, each party \n27\nshall bear its own costs, expenses and attorneys’ fees. \n28 55.  The use of the masculine gender herein is construed to include the \n  17 \n \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 107      Filed 06/23/2009     Page 21 of 24\n   \n1 feminine and/or the neuter where applicable. The use of the singular herein is to be \n2 construed to include the plural where applicable. The use of the plural herein shall \n3 be construed to include the singular where applicable.  \n4 56.  The Court reserves and maintains jurisdiction over this settlement, this \n5 Consent Judgment and its provisions, and over the claims administration and \ndistribution of the funds. Disagreements between or among parties over aspects of \n6\nthis Consent Judgment as it relates to monetary relief shall be subject to mediation \n7\nbefore United States Magistrate Judge Carla Woehrle, the mediator who has \n8\nmediated this case to date. If mediation is not successful, the matter shall be \n9\nbrought to this Court for resolution. \n10\n57.  At the conclusion of the distribution of the Post Administration Class \n11\nFund, the Administrator shall submit a report to the Court summarizing the \n12\npayments made to the Unrepresented Class Members.  \n13\nXVI. FINAL RESOLUTION  \n14\n58.  The monetary relief provided for in this Consent Judgment shall \n15\ncompensate for all alleged violations of rights and all claims by the Damages \n16\nClass Members on Matters Alleged in the Lawsuit under any theory of liability \n17\nrelated to the events of May 1, 2007, that come within the Damages Class \n18\ndefinition, except as to monetary damages for those class members who opt out.  \n19\n59.  The Court hereby dismisses the lawsuit on the merits, with prejudice, \n20\nand without further costs, with such dismissal subject only to compliance by the \n21\nparties with the terms and conditions of the Settlement Agreement, the Structural \n22\nRelief Order, and this Consent Judgment. \n23\n60.  With the exception of Antonio Lopez, all Damages Class Members \n24\nand Structural Relief Class Members, including all the Represented Individuals \n25\nand the Unrepresented Class Members, as well as any and all of their agents, \n26\nattorneys and assigns, are hereby severally and permanently barred and enjoined, \n27\nto the fullest extent permitted by law, from filing, commencing, instituting, \n28 maintaining, prosecuting or participating in a lawsuit or any other proceeding \n  18 \n \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 107      Filed 06/23/2009     Page 22 of 24\n   \n1 against any of the Defendants or other Released Person, involving or in any way \n2 arising from any of the Matters Alleged in the Lawsuit, including specifically \n3 claims of any class member whose claims are dismissed by this Consent \n4 Judgment.  \n5 61.  The Represented Individuals and Unrepresented Class Members \nwaive all rights or benefits which they now have or in the future may have under \n6\nthe terms of California Civil Code §1542, arising from, alleged in, or pertaining to \n7\nthe Matters Alleged in the Lawsuit, specifically claims related to the events of \n8\nMay 1, 2007, that come within the Damages Class Member definition, except as to \n9\nmonetary damages for those class members who have opted out. Section 1542 \n10\nreads: \n11\n“A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not \n12\nknow or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the \n13\nrelease, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or \n14\nher settlement with the debtor.” \n15\n62.  The Defendants, and all of their agents, attorneys and assigns, waive \n16\nand release any and all claims or rights to pursue, initiate, prosecute, or commence \n17\nany action or proceeding before any court, administrative agency or other tribunal, \n18\nor to file any complaint regarding acts or omissions, by the Plaintiffs in any of the \n19\ncases covered in the settlement herein, by any Represented Individuals as defined \n20\nherein, and by any Unrepresented Class Members, with respect to any Matters \n21\nAlleged in the Lawsuit, including waiver of the right to file a malicious \n22\nprosecution action; and further, as it relates to this waiver, expressly waive the \n23\nprovisions of California Civil Code §1542 recited in the previous paragraph.  \n24\n63.  Plaintiffs have not relied upon the advice of Class Counsel as to the \n25\nlegal and/or tax consequences of this settlement, the payment of any money by the \n26\nDefendants or the distribution of any settlement funds.  \n27\n64.  Neither this Consent Judgment, the Settlement Agreement, nor any of \n28 its terms or the negotiations or papers related thereto shall constitute evidence or \n  19 \n \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 107      Filed 06/23/2009     Page 23 of 24\n   \n1 an admission by any Defendant or other Released Person that any acts of \n2 wrongdoing have been committed, and they shall not be deemed to create any \n3 inference that there is any liability therefore. Neither this Consent Judgment, nor \n4 the Settlement Agreement, nor any of its terms or the negotiations or papers \n5 related thereto shall be offered or received in evidence or used for any purpose \nwhatsoever, in this or any other matter or proceeding in any court, administrative \n6\nagency, arbitration, or other tribunal, except insofar as the parties seeks to enforce \n7\nthe terms of this Consent Judgment or the underlying Settlement Agreement. \n8\n65.

[Honorable A. Howard Matz] \n22 \n23  Plaintiffs,  STRUCTURAL RELIEF ORDER \n24 \nvs.  DATE:  June 22, 2009 \nTIME:  10:00 A.M. \n25 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES, et aI.,  COURTROOM:  14 \n26 \nDefendants. \n27 \n28 \n1 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 112      Filed 06/24/2009     Page 2 of 7\nCa  2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM  Document 109  Filed 06/23/2009  Page 2 of 7 \n1  The parties to the above-captioned action have submitted this joint Order for \n2  the Court's review and approval, addressing the injunctive relief class certified by \n3  the Court in its Order issued on January 8, 2008.  The court has considered the \n4  joint submission and now issues the following Order: \n5  1.  Basic Principles: \n6  All persons have the right to march, demonstrate, protest, rally or perform \n7  other activities protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution \n8  and the California Constitution.  The government may impose reasonable and \n9  narrowly tailored restrictions on the time, place, and manner of conducting these \n10  activities.  However, any limitations or restrictions placed on demonstrations or \n11  other First Amendment activities must be justified by the requirements of \n12  maintaining public safety, public health, or safe access/egress from the area, and \nshould restrict no more speech than necessary to further these substantial \n13 \ngovernment interests.  Officers must not be affected by the content of the opinions \n14 \nbeing expressed nor by the race, gender, linguistics, national origin, sexual \n15 \norientation, physical disabilities, appearances, or affiliation of anyone exercising \n16 \nlawful rights. \n17 \n2.  Helicopters: \n18 \nLos Angeles Police Department (LAPD) helicopters assigned to monitor \n19 \npermitted crowd control incidents shall operate the aircraft at reasonable altitudes \n20 \nso as to avoid disruption of First Amendment protected activities.  The Incident \n21 \nCommander will coordinate with event organizers to help avoid over flights during \n22 \nkeynote speaker presentations.  This action is not intended to prevent LAPD \n23 \n24  helicopters from response to emergency situations requiring immediate police \n25  presence during such crowd control events. \n26 \n27 \n28 \n2 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 112      Filed 06/24/2009     Page 3 of 7\nCa  2:07 -cv-03072-AHM-FFM  Document 109  Filed 06/23/2009  Page 3 of 7 \n1  3.  Marches: \n2  Demonstrators, while participating in lawful assemblages, shall not be \n3  prevented from using public sidewalks to join or exit a lawful march or from using \n4  any public sidewalk adjacent to a lawful march route.  However, while on the \n5  sidewalk, marchers will not be allowed to obstruct or unreasonably interfere with \n6  pedestrian movement and/or prevent lawfully open businesses from operating \n7  when such conduct violates any applicable law.  LAPD will consider the \n8  practicality of facilitating demonstrations that may temporarily block traffic and \n9  LAPD shall include the subject in its Crowd Management training. \n10  4.  Motorcycles/Bicycles/Motor Vehicles: \n11  Police motorcycles, bicycles, and motor vehicles may be used for the \n12  purpose of observation, visible deterrence, traffic control, transportation and area \ncontrol during a crowd event.  When used at the back of a march, they should \n13 \nmaintain a reasonably safe distance behind the marchers.  LAPD personnel will not \n14 \nutilize motorcycles, bicycles, or motor vehicles to strike assembled \n15 \ndemonstrators/marchers as a method for crowd control or crowd dispersal. \n16 \n5.  Crowd Management Training - Horses: \n17 \nIn its crowd management training, the LAPD shall include a subject on the \n18 \nimpact of the use of horses on crowd behavior. \n19 \n6.  Use of Less Lethal Weapons: \n20 \nLess-lethal munitions are categorized as projectiles launched or otherwise \n21 \ndeployed for the purpose of overcoming resistance, effecting arrest or addressing \n22 \nthe threat of serious injury to an officer or suspect with less risk of causing death \n23 \nthan the use of a firearm. \n24 \na.  Less-lethal munitions may be deployed on aggressive and/or \n25 \ncombative suspects in a crowd control situation, on suspects who \n26 \n27 \n28 \n3 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 112      Filed 06/24/2009     Page 4 of 7\nCa  2:07 -cv-03072-AHM-FFM  Document 109  Filed 06/23/2009  Page 4 of 7 \n1  are a potential physical threat to themselves or others, or suspects \n2  displaying \"aggressive\" and/or \"combative\" actions. \n3  b.  For the purpose of deployment ofless-Iethal munitions, \n4  \"aggressive\" and/or \"combative\" actions include ongoing \n5  destruction of property that presents a threat to the personal safety \n6  of officers or others. \n7  c.  Less lethal weapons should not be used on a lawfully dispersing \n8  crowd or individual. \n9  d.  Less lethal weapons should not be used against a person or a crowd \n10  that is retreating unless the person or crowd continues to engage in \n11  unlawful activity that is aggressive and/or combative. \n12  e.  Where feasible, notice should be given to the crowd before less \nlethal weapons are deployed in a crowd control or dispersal \n13 \nsituation, and where feasible, it should be given in the language(s) \n14 \nspoken by those assembled. \n15 \nf.  If the LAPD resumes the use of stinger rounds, the LAPD will \n16 \npublish a notice that will require that less-lethal stinger weapons \n17 \ncan be used only with the approval of a staff officer (i.e., \n18 \ncommander or above) and only in a riotous situation where the use \n19 \nof lethal force would not be reasonable. \n20 \n7.  Use of Batons: \n21 \nBatons should not be used against members of the crowd attempting to \n22 \ndisperse, persons unable to move because of the press of the crowd, or persons \n23 \notherwise posing no imminent threat to the officers or other persons.  Batons may \n24 \nbe displayed or used in a pushing motion when used as a justified and authorized \n25 \ncrowd management technique.  The baton may be used to push individuals who \n26 \nintentionally delay dispersal subsequent to a lawful order to disperse.  When an \n27 \n28 \n4 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 112      Filed 06/24/2009     Page 5 of 7\nCa  2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM  Document 109  Filed 06/23/2009  Page 5 of 7 \n1  individual's behavior is threatening or violent in nature, the baton may be used as \n2  an impact device in accordance with Department policy. \n3  8.  Public Assemblies: \n4  The Incident Commander and supervisors shall make every effort to ensure \n5  that the police mission is accomplished as efficiently as possible, with the highest \n6  regard for human dignity and liberty of all persons, with consideration of the \n7  cultural and linguistic diversity of the neighborhoods and communities of Los \n8  Angeles, and with minimum reliance on the use of physical force.  Incident \n9  Commanders, prior to declaring an assembly unlawful, will follow the procedures \nas directed in the LAPD Guidelines for Crowd Management and Crowd Control, \n10 \n11  Volume 5 of the LAPD Emergency Operations Guide.  Before any public assembly \nis declared to be unlawful, the Incident Commander should evaluate the feasibility \n12 \nof isolating and arresting those responsible for the unlawful conduct, and if it is \n13 \ndetermined to be feasible, shall take such action. \n14 \n9.  Declaration of Unlawful Assembly: \n15 \nCrowd dispersal techniques shall not be initiated until after a declaration has \n16 \nbeen announced as required by California Penal Code Section 409.  LAPD \n17 \npersonnel will follow the procedures as directed in the LAPD Guidelines for \n18 \nCrowd Management and Crowd Control, Volume 5 of the LAPD Emergency \n19 \nOperations Guide.  The following factors shall be considered when issuing a \n20 \ndispersal order: \n21 \na.  Use of an amplified loudspeaker system to issue the order. \n22 \nb. If feasible, send an officer to the far side of the crowd to tape record \n23 \nthe order. \n24 \nc.  If circumstances permit (absence of serious violence), the order \n25 \nshall be made repeatedly over a period of time and, if necessary, \n26 \nfrom a variety of locations. \n27 \n28 \n5 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 112      Filed 06/24/2009     Page 6 of 7\nCa  2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM  Document 109  Filed 06/23/2009  Page 6 of 7 \n1  d.  The order must include an objectively reasonable period of time to \n2  disperse and a clear and safe route to disperse based on the facts \n3  and circumstances known at the time. \n4  e.  An order to disperse shall be given in a manner reasonably \n5  calculated to be heard by the entire crowd under the circumstances. \n6  When it is known that members of the crowd do not understand \n7  English, an effort should be made, when feasible, to give the order \n8  to disperse in both English and the other language(s). \n9  f.  The order to disperse shall include a warning that police action may \n10  include the use of less lethal munitions, which could cause \n11  significant risk of serious injury to those who remain. \n12  10.  Crowd Management Training - Shows of Force \n13  In its crowd management training, the LAPD shall include a subject on the \n14  impact of shows of force on crowd behavior. \n15  11.  LAPD's Policy Regarding Crowd Control: \nLAPD's policy regarding crowd control can be found in the Emergency \n16 \nOperations Guide, Volume 5, Chapter 7.  All LAPD directives and orders directly \n17 \nrelated to crowd control and the relevant portions of this agreement shall be \n18 \nincluded in the Emergency Operations Guide by July 1,2009.  The plaintiffs shall \n19 \n20  be given an opportunity to provide input and comment on the revisions prior to \n21  final approval by the LAPD. \n12.  Training on Crowd Control Policies: \n22 \nThe LAPD shall require Metropolitan Division to undergo training annually, \n23 \nand every officer at the level of Sergeant I and above to undergo training at \n24 \n25  minimum intervals of two years, on the Crowd Control and Use of Force policies \n26  to be developed pursuant to Paragraph 11 of this document.  The Department's \n27  existing training, designed and implemented after May 1,2007, will be reviewed \n28 \n6 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03072-AHM-FFM     Document 112      Filed 06/24/2009     Page 7 of 7\nCa  2:07 -cv-03072-AHM-FFM  Document 109  Filed 06/23/2009  Page 7 of 7 \n1  and modified, as necessary, to conform to the policies developed as part of this \n2  agreement.  The training may be live or bye-module, or both, at the Department's \n3  discretion. \n4  13.  Retention of Jurisdiction: \n5  The Court retains jurisdiction to enforce the terms of this judgment and to \n6  issue all orders necessary to do so.  The Court's jurisdiction shall continue for a \n7  period of four years and may be extended-in whole or in part-for an additional \n8  period of two years upon proof by a preponderance of the evidence that the \n9  activities complained of are due to the Department's failure to substantially comply \n10  with the provisions of this order. \n11  Before bringing a motion to enforce this order, plaintiffs shall give \n12  defendants notice of an alleged violation and a reasonable opportunity to remedy it. \n13  If necessary to permit defendants adequate time to remedy the alleged failure to \n14  comply, the parties will submit a joint request to extend the Court's initial period \n15  of jurisdiction. \nT JUDGE \n18 \n19 \nSubmitted by: \n20 \nLITT, ESTUAR, HARRISON & KITSON, LLP \n21 \nLAW OFFICES OF CAROL SOBEL \n22 \n23 \n24  By:  /s/  Barrett S.
