Plaintiff argues that this strip search and delousing policy as applied to pretrial detainees charged with misdemeanors or other minor crimes is unconstitutional under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The plaintiff brings this action on behalf of himself and others similarly situated seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, compensatory damages, and attorneys' fees and costs. </p><p>On October 28, 2009, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the action. On August 05, 2010, Judge Robert C. Chambers denied the defendants' motion to dismiss.</p><p>Discovery proceeded in this case until June 1, 2011, when Judge Chambers signed the parties’ proposed stipulation to stay further proceedings in this matter until after the United States Supreme Court issued a decision in <i><a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detailDocument.php?id=41186\">Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders</a></i>, another strip search case in a jail setting.

On August 12, 2013, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgement. On August 27, 2013, the plaintiffs responded with a cross-motion for summary judgement. On October 4, 2013, Judge Robert C. Chambers released an order granting the defendant's motion for summary judgement and denying the plaintiff's. Judge Chambers ruled that based on the precedent set in <i>Florence</i>, defendant's strip search and delousing of plaintiff was not unconstitutional, and in doing so denied plaintiff's class-action certification. The case is now closed. </p>",

Miller, both individually and in his \nofficial capacity as Executive Director of the \nWest Virginia Regional Jail and Correctional \nFacility Authority. \nDefendants. \nINTRODUCTION \nThis is a class action brought to redress the deprivation by Defendants of rights secured to \nthe Plaintiff and proposed Class by the United States Constitution and the laws of the United \nStates  of America.  For  at  least  the  past  11  years,  the  West  Virginia  Regional  Jail  and \nCorrectional Facility Authority has had a policy of strip  searching all individuals who enter any \nof the West Virginia Regional Jails and placing them in jail clothing, regardless ofthe crime with \nwhich they are charged.  In addition, the West Virginia Regional Jail and Correctional Facility \nAuthority also requires that all pre-trial detainees be deloused by having corrections officers use \n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758     Document 1      Filed 07/01/2009     Page 2 of 18\nplastic  bottles  to  spray  caustic  delousing  solution  over  the  genitals  of detainees.  Upon \ninfonnation and belief, these policies are,  in part, derived from  the written procedures of the \nWest Virginia Regional Jail and Correctional Facility Authority, and were promulgated by senior \nWest Virginia Regional Jail and Correctional Facility Authority officials named herein. \nIt is well established in this judicial circuit that individuals charged with misdemeanors or \nother minor crimes cannot be strip-searched absent particularized suspicion that they possess \nweapons  or contraband.  Consequently,  the  policy of the  West  Virginia Regional  Jail  and \nCorrectional  Facility  Authority  to  force  those  charged  with  minor  crimes  to  undergo  the \nindignities  of a strip search  upon  entry into  the  any of the  West Virginia Regional Jails  is \ninsensitive, unnecessary, and illegal. \nPlaintiff Cantley brings this action on behalf of himself,  and on behalf of a Class of \nthousands of others who were strip searched after being charged with petty crimes, to vindicate \nthe clear and  unnecessary violation  of his  civil  rights  and  those  of the  Class Members  he \nproposes to represent.  Plaintiff was charged with a non-felony offense, and was subjected to a \nstrip search, in violation of his right against unreasonable searches under the Fourth Amendment \nof the United States Constitution.  Plaintiff seeks monetary damages from Defendant Terry L. \nMiller for himself and each member of the Proposed Class, a declaration that Defendant West \nVirginia Regional Jail and Correctional Facility Authority's policies are unconstitutional, and an \ninjunction precluding Defendant West Virginia Regional Jail and Correctional Facility Authority \nand  Defendant Terry L.  Miller from  continuing to violate the rights of those placed into the \ncustody of the Regional Jails that they administer.  With this as a background, Plaintiff Cantley \ncomplains as follows: \n2 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758     Document 1      Filed 07/01/2009     Page 3 of 18\nJURISDICTION \n1.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. §§ \n1331, 1341 & 1343 because it is filed to obtain compensatory damages and injunctive relief for \nthe deprivation, under color of state law, of the rights of citizens of the United States secured by \nthe Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  This Court also has jurisdiction \nover this action under the provisions of28 U.S.C. § 2201, as it is filed to obtain declaratory relief \nrelative to the constitutionality ofthe policies of a state government. \n2.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) because a substantial part of the \nevents or omissions  giving rise  to  Plaintiffs and Class claims occurred within this judicial \ndistrict. \nPARTIES \n3.  Plaintiff Cantley is an adult male residing in Cabell County, West Virginia.  On or \nabout September 28, 2008, he was arrested and placed in the Western Regional Jail on on non \nfelony charges of violating an order of protection at the home of his ex-wife. \n4.  Defendant  West  Virginia  Regional  Jail  and  Correctional  Facility  Authority \n(\"WVRJA\") is a state government agency organized and existing under the laws of the State of \nWest Virginia.  At all  times  relevant hereto,  the  WVRJA was  responsible  for  the policies, \npractices, supervision, implementation and conduct of all matters pertaining to the West Virginia \nRegional Jail System and was responsible for the appointment, training, supervision and conduct \nof all Regional  Jail personnel, including those working in the Central Regional Jail, Eastern \nRegional Jail, North Central Regional Jail, Northern Regional Jail, Potomac Highlands Regional \nJail,  South Central Regional Jail, Southern Regional Jail, Southwestern Regional Jail, Tygart \n3 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758     Document 1      Filed 07/01/2009     Page 4 of 18\nValley Regional Jail, and the Western Regional Jail (collectively the \"West Virginia Regional \nJail System\" or \"WVRJS\").  In addition, at all relevant times, the WVRJA was responsible for \nenforcing the rules of the West Virginia Regional Jail System, and for ensuring that personnel \nemployed in West Virginia Regional Jail system obey the Constitution and laws of the United \nStates and of the State of West Virginia. \n5.  Defendant Terry L.  Miller (\"Director Miller\") is  the duly appointed Executive \nDirector of the WVRJA, and, as such, is a policy maker with respect to the treatment of pre-trial \nand  other detainees  over which  the  WVRJA  exercises custodial  or other control.  Director \nMiller's principal place of business is the WVRJA's Office, 1325 Virginia St. East, Charleston \nWest Virginia, 25301.  Director Miller is made a Defendant in this action in both his individual \nand official capacities. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n6.  Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Rules 23(b)(1), 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) ofthe \nFederal  Rules  of Civil  Procedure  on  behalf of himself and  a  Class  of similarly  situated \nindividuals who were charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and were strip searched upon \ntheir entry into  the  West Virginia Regional Jail System, including the Central Regional Jail, \nEastern Regional Jail, North Central Regional Jail, Northern Regional Jail. Potomac Highlands \nRegional Jail, South Central Regional Jail. Southern Regional Jail. Southwestern Regional Jail, \nTygart Valley Regional Jail, and the Western Regional Jail. \n7.  The Class that Plaintiff seeks to represent is defined as follows: \nAll persons who have been or will be placed into the custody of the West \nVirginia  Regional  Jail  System,  after  being  charged  with  misdemeanors, \nsummary  violations,  violations  of  probation,  traffic  infractions,  civil \n4 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758     Document 1      Filed 07/01/2009     Page 5 of 18\ncommitments or other minor crimes and were or will be strip searched upon \ntheir entry into  the West Virginia Regional  Jail System, pursuant to  the \npolicy,  custom  and  practice  of the  West  Virginia  Regional  Jail  and \nCorrectional Facility Authority.  The class period commences on June 30, \n2007 and extends to the date on which the West Virginia Regional Jail and \nCorrectional  Facility  Authority  is  enjoined  from,  or  otherwise  ceases, \nenforcing its policy, practice and custom of conducting strip searches absent \nreasonable suspicion.  Specifically excluded from the class are Defendants \nand  any and  all  of their respective affiliates,  legal  representatives, heirs, \nsuccessors, employees or assignees. \n8.  This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a Class action \nunder  Federal  law  and  satisfies  the  numerosity,  commonality,  typicality  and  adequacy \nrequirements for maintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n9.  The members of the Class are so numerous as to render joinder impracticable. \nUpon  information  and  belief,  there  are  hundreds  of people  arrested  for  misdemeanors  and \nviolations who  are placed into  the custody of the West Virginia Regional Jail System every \nmonth -- all of whom are members of the Proposed Class.  Upon information and belief, the size \nof the Proposed Class totals at least thousands of individuals, some of whom have had their civil \nrights violated on multiple occasions. \n10.  Upon information and belief, joinder of all of these individuals is impracticable \nbecause of the large number of Class Members and  the  fact  that Class Members are  likely \ndispersed over a large geographical area, with some members presently residing outside of West \nVirginia and this Judicial District.  Furthermore, upon information and belief, many members of \nthe Class are low-income persons, may not speak English, and likely would have great difficulty \nin pursuing their rights individually. \n5 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758     Document 1      Filed 07/01/2009     Page 6 of 18\n11.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, in that \nthey  all  had  their  right  to  be  free  from  unreasonable  searches  and  delousing  violated  by \nDefendants' conducting strip searches absent particularized suspicion.  All members of the Class \nwere charged with misdemeanors or summary violations when placed into the custody of the \nWest Virginia Regional Jail System, and  all were illegally strip searched in violation of the \nestablished law in this judicial circuit. \n12.  Plaintiffs claims are typical of the claims of the members of the Class.  Plaintiff \nand all members of the Class sustained damages arising out of Defendants' course of conduct. \nThe harms suffered by the Plaintiff are typical ofthe harms suffered by the Class Members. \n13.  The representative Plaintiff has the requisite personal interest in the outcome of \nthis  action and will  fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class.  Plaintiff has no \ninterests that are adverse to the interests of the Members of the Class. \n14.  Plaintiff has retained counsel with substantial experience in the prosecution of \nClass  action  and  civil  rights  litigation,  including successful  litigation  of strip  search cases. \nPlaintiffs counsel  has the resources,  expertise and  experience to  successfully prosecute this \naction against the WVRJA and Director Miller.  Counsel for the Plaintiff knows of no conflicts \namong members of the Class or between counsel and members of the Class. \n15.  This action, in part, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.  As such, the Plaintiff \nseeks Class Certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), in that all Class Members were subject \nto the same policy requiring the illegal strip searches and delousing of individuals charged with \nmisdemeanor or minor crimes and placed into the custody of the West Virginia Regional Jail \n6 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758     Document 1      Filed 07/01/2009     Page 7 of 18\nSystem.  In short, the WVRJA, Director Miller, and the Regional Jail personnel acted on grounds \ngenerally applicable to all Class Members. \n16.  In addition to certification under Rule 23(b )(2), and in the alternative, Plaintiffs \nseek certification under Rule 23(b)(3). \n17.  Common questions of law  and  fact  exist as to  all members of the Class, and \npredominate  over  any  questions  that  affect  only  individual  members  of the  Class.  These \ncommon questions of law and fact  include, without limitation, the common and predominate \nquestion  of whether  the  Defendants'  written  and/or  de facto  policy of strip  searching  and \ndelousing all individuals charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and committed to the Jail \nis a violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and \nwhether such a written and/or de facto policy existed during the Class Period. \n18.  A Class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy, since joinder of all of the individual members of the Class is \nimpracticable given the large number of Class Members and the fact that they are dispersed over \na large geographical area.  Furthermore, the expense and burden of individual litigation would \nmake it difficult or impossible for individual members of the Class to redress the wrongs done to \nthem.  The cost to the federal court system of adjudicating thousands of individual cases would \nbe enormous.  Individualized litigation would also magnify the delay and expense to all parties \nand the court system.  By contrast, the conduct of this action as a Class action in this District \npresents far fewer management difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court \nsystem, and protects the rights of each member of the Class. \n7 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758     Document 1      Filed 07/01/2009     Page 8 of 18\n19.  Upon information and belief, there are no other actions pending to address the \nDefendants' flagrant violation of the civil rights of thousands of individuals, even though the \nDefendants have maintained their illegal strip search and delousing regimen for at least the past \n[three] years. \n20.  In the alternative to certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), Plaintiff also \nseeks partial certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4). \nFACTS \nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally \n21.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits state officials, \nsuch as Director Miller in this action and the Corrections Officers he supervises, from performing \nstrip searches of arrestees who have been charged with misdemeanors or other minor crimes \nunless the officer has reasonable suspicion to believe that the arrestee is concealing a weapon or \ncontraband. \n22.  Upon information and belief, the WVRJA and Director Miller have instituted a \nwritten andlor de facto policy, custom or practice of strip searching and delousing all individuals \nwho enter the custody of the West Virginia Regional Jail System, regardless of the nature of their \ncharged crime and without the presence of reasonable suspicion to believe that the individual was \nconcealing a weapon or contraband. \n23.  Upon information and belief, the WVRJA and Director Miller have instituted a \nwritten  and/or de facto  policy, custom or practice of conducting visual body cavity searches \n(visual inspection of the vaginal and rectal cavities) on all individuals who enter the custody of \nthe West Virginia Regional Jail System, regardless of the individual characteristics or the nature \n8 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758     Document 1      Filed 07/01/2009     Page 9 of 18\nof their charged crime.  For purposes of this Complaint, strip and visual cavity searches are \ncollectively referred to as \"strip searches\". \n24.  Upon information and belief, some members of the Proposed Class (not including \nthe Plaintiff) are also required to undergo physical cavity searches upon entry to the custody of \nthe WVRJA, where a Corrections Officer inserts a gloved finger into the rectum of a detainee to \nsearch for contraband. \n25.  Upon information and belief, the WVRJA and Director Miller have instituted a \nwritten and/or de facto  policy, custom or practice of delousing all individuals who  enter the \ncustody of the West Virginia Regional Jail System, regardless of the individual characteristics or \nthe nature of their charged crime.  The delousing procedure first entails a detainee completely \ndisrobing in front of a correction officer.  The correction officer then sprays delousing solution \nupon a detainee's naked body.  Finally, the detainee is ordered to shower within full view of the \ncorrections officer.  The delousing procedure is conducted upon all detainees without inquiry into \nor establishment of reasonable suspicion, or inquiry or establishment into whether the detainee \nactually harbors lice. \n26.  The WVRJA and Director Miller know that they may not institute, enforce or \npermit enforcement of a policy or practice of conducting strip searches and delousing without \nparticularized, reasonable suspicion. \n27.  The Defendants' written and/or de facto policy, practice and custom mandating \nwholesale strip  searches  and  delousing of all  misdemeanor and  violation arrestees has been \npromulgated, effectuated and/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly established law. \n9 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758     Document 1      Filed 07/01/2009     Page 10 of 18\n28.  Reasonable  suspicion  to  conduct  a  strip  search  may only emanate  from  the \nparticular circumstances antecedent to the search, such as the nature of the crime charged, the \nparticular characteristics of the arrestees, and/or the circumstances of the arrest. \n29.  Upon information and belief, the WVRJA and Director Miller have promulgated, \nimplemented,  enforced,  and/or  failed  to  rectify a written  and/or de facto  policy,  practice or \ncustom of strip  searching and delousing all  individuals placed into the custody of the  West \nVirginia  Regional  Jail  System  without  any  requirement  of reasonable  suspicion,  or indeed \nsuspicion of any sort.  This written and/or de facto policy made the strip searching of pre-trial \ndetainees routine; neither the nature of the offense charged, the characteristics of the arrestee, nor \nthe circumstances of a particular arrest were relevant to the enforcement of the policy, practice \nand custom of routine strip searches. \n30.  Pursuant  to  this  written  and/or  de facto  policy,  each  member  of the  Class, \nincluding the named Plaintiff, was the victim of a routine strip search upon their entry into the \nWest Virginia Regional  Jail  System.  These searches and delousing were conducted without \ninquiry  into  or  establishment  of reasonable  suspicion,  and  in  fact  were  not  supported  by \nreasonable suspicion.  Strip searches are conducted for individuals arrested for,  among other \ninnocuous offenses, Driving While Intoxicated, Harassment and Trespassing. \n31.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search conducted pursuant \nto this written and/or de facto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip searches and delousing - \neach  member  of the  class,  including  the  named  Plaintiff -- has  suffered  or  will  suffer \npsychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \n10 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758     Document 1      Filed 07/01/2009     Page 11 of 18\nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiff \n32.  Plaintiff Cantley is an adult male residing in Cabell County, West Virginia.  On or \nabout  September 28,  2008  he  was  arrested  on  non-felony charges  of violating an  order of \nprotection at the home of his ex-wife.  Specifically, Mr. Cantley was required to stay away from \nhis former wife's home, and failed to do so on the date in question.  The allegations against Mr. \nCantley did not involve a claim that he had harmed his wife, or anyone else, but rather that he \nwas present in a location at which he was forbidden to be present. \n33.  Plaintiff Cantley's arrest was void of any reasonable suspicion that he harbored \nany weapons or contraband. \n34.  Mr. Cantley was first taken in custody by the West Virginia State Police, and later \nthat evening taken to the Western Regional Jail.  The Plaintiff was initially housed in a holding \ncell. \n35.  After being housed in a holding cell for several hours, the Plaintiffwas required to \nundergo a strip search. \n36.  Plaintiff was brought into a shower room and advised by a correctional officer that \nhe  would  be  strip  searched.  In connection with the  strip  search,  Plaintiff was  required  to \ncompletely disrobe, lift his arms and legs, spread his butt cheeks, lift up his testicles and bend \nover, so that he could be inspected by a correctional officer.  Plaintiff was then sprayed with de \nlousing solution and ordered to  shower while the corrections officer had a complete view of \nPlaintiff showering.  He was then issued prison clothing. \n37.  Plaintiff was released from the Western Regional Jail on or about November 6, \n2008, and all charges were dismissed. \n11 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758     Document 1      Filed 07/01/2009     Page 12 of 18\n38.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search, Plaintiffhas suffered \nand continues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST DIRECTOR MILLER IN \nHIS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY \n-- Violation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law -\n- Illegal Strip and Visual Cavity Searches -\n39.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges each and every allegation stated \nin the foregoing paragraphs. \n40.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects citizens from \nunreasonable searches by law enforcement officers, and prohibits officers from conducting strip \nsearches  and  delousing  of individuals  arrested  for  misdemeanors  or violations  absent  some \nparticularized suspicion that the individual in question has either contraband or weapons. \n41.  The actions of Director Miller detailed above violated Plaintiffs rights under the \nUnited States Constitution.  It was not objectively reasonable for West Virginia Regional Jail \npersonnel to strip search and delouse the Plaintiff and Class Members based on their arrests for \nmisdemeanor/ summary violation charges.  It was also not objectively reasonable for Director \nMiller to order/direct West Virginia Regional Jail System personnel to conduct such searches. \n42.  These strip searches and delouses were conducted pursuant to the policy, custom \nor practice of Director Miller.  As such, Director Miller is directly liable for the damages of \nPlaintiff and members of the Class. \n12 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758     Document 1      Filed 07/01/2009     Page 13 of 18\n43.  Upon infonnation and belief, Director Miller is responsible for establishing the \npolicies and procedures to be utilized in the operation of the Western Regional Jail system, and is \nresponsible for the implementation of the strip search and delousing policies questioned in this \nlawsuit.  As such, Director Miller is individually responsible for the damages of the Plaintiff and \nMembers of the Class. \n44.  The Policy Making Defendants knew that the Jail's strip search and delousing \npolicies were illegal, and acted willfully, knowingly, and with specific intent to deprive Plaintiff \nand Members of the Class of their Constitutional rights. \n45.  This conduct on the part of all Defendants represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. § \n1983, given that their actions were taken under color of state law. \n46.  As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above, \nPlaintiff and the Members of the Class have been irreparably injured. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST DIRECTOR MILLER IN \nHIS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY \n-- Violation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law --\n- The Right to Privacy -\n47.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges each and every allegation stated \nin the foregoing paragraphs. \n48.  The  right  to  privacy  is  protected  by the  Fourth  Amendment  and  IS  also  an \nindependent right with other constitutional underpinnings. \n13 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758     Document 1      Filed 07/01/2009     Page 14 of 18\n49.  The right to privacy prohibits officers from conducting delousing of individuals \narrested for misdemeanors or violations absent some particularized suspicion that the individual \nin question has lice. \n50.  The actions of Director Miller detailed above violated and  improperly invaded \nPlaintiffs right to privacy.  It was not objectively reasonable for West Virginia Regional Jail \npersonnel  to  delouse  the  Plaintiff  and  Class  Members  based  on  their  arrests  for \nmisdemeanor/summary violation charges.  It was also not objectively reasonable for Director \nMiller to order/direct West Virginia Regional Jail System personnel to conduct such a procedure. \n51.  This  delousing  was  conducted  pursuant  to  the  policy,  custom  or  practice  of \nDirector Miller.  As  such,  Director Miller is directly liable for the damages of Plaintiff and \nmembers of the Class. \n52.  Upon information and belief, Director Miller is responsible for establishing the \npolicies and procedures to  be utilized  in  the operation of the Western Regional Jail,  and  is \nresponsible for the implementation of the delousing policies questioned in this lawsuit.  As such, \nDirector Miller is individually responsible for the damages of the Plaintiff and Members of the \nClass. \n53.  The Policy Making Defendant knew that the Jail's delousing policies were illegal, \nand acted willfully, knowingly, and with specific intent to deprive Plaintiff and Members of the \nClass of their Constitutional rights. \n54.  This conduct on the part of all Defendants represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. § \n1983, given that their actions were taken under color of state law. \n14 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758     Document 1      Filed 07/01/2009     Page 15 of 18\n55.  As  a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above, \nPlaintiff and the members of the Class have been irreparably injured. \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \n- Demand for Declaratory Judgment -\n56.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges each and every allegation stated \nin the foregoing paragraphs. \n57.  The policy, custom and practice of the WVRJA and Director Miller is clearly \nunconstitutional  and  violates  the  right  to  privacy,  in  that  these  entities  and  individuals  are \ndirecting/conducting the strip searches and delousing of all  individuals placed into the West \nVirginia  Regional  Jail  System  without  any  particularized  suspicion  that  the  individuals  in \nquestion have either contraband or weapons. \n58.  Plaintiff and Members of the Class request that this Court issue a declaratory \njudgment, and that it declare the strip search and delousing policies of the WVRJA and Director \nMiller to be unconstitutional and violative of the right to privacy. \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \n- Demand for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction -\n59.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges each and every allegation stated \nin the foregoing paragraphs. \n60.  The policy, custom and practice of the WVRJA and Director Miller is clearly \nunconstitutional and violative of the right to privacy, in that these entities and individuals are \ndirecting/conducting the strip searches and delousing of all  individuals placed into the West \n15 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758     Document 1      Filed 07/01/2009     Page 16 of 18\nVirginia  Regional  Jail  system  without  any  particularized  suspIcIon  that  the  individuals  In \nquestion have either contraband, weapons, or lice. \n61.  Upon information and belief, this policy is currently in place in the West Virginia \nRegional Jail System, with new and/or prospective Members of the Class being subjected to the \nharms that have already been inflicted upon the Plaintiff. \n62.  The continuing pattern of strip searching and delousing individuals charged with \nminor crimes will cause irreparable harm to the new and/or prospective Members of the Class, an \nadequate remedy for which does not exist at law. \n63.  Plaintiff demands  that  the  WVRJA,  Director  Miller,  and  the  West  Virginia \nRegional  Jail  System  personnel  immediately  desist  from  strip  searching  and  delousing \nindividuals  placed  into  the  custody of the  West  Virginia  Regional  Jail  System  absent  any \nparticularized suspicion that the individuals in question have either contraband, weapons, or lice, \nand seeks both a preliminary and permanent injunction from this Court ordering as much. \nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY \n64.  The Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff Cantley, on behalf of himself and on behalf of a Class of others \nsimilarly situated, requests that this Honorable Court grant them the following relief: \n1.  An order certifying this action as a Class Action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. \n16 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758     Document 1      Filed 07/01/2009     Page 17 of 18\n2.

A declaratory judgment against all Defendants declaring the WVRJA and Director \nMiller's policy, practice and custom of strip and visual cavity searching, and delousing, of all \ndetainees entering the West Virginia Regional Jail System, regardless of the crime charged or \nsuspicion of contraband or lice, to be unconstitutional, violative of the right to privacy and \notherwise improper. \n4.  A preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining all Defendants from continuing \nto strip and visual cavity search, and delouse, individuals charged with misdemeanors or minor \ncrimes absent particularized, reasonable suspicion that the arrestee subjected to the search is \nconcealing weapons or other contraband or lice. \n5.  A monetary award for attorneys' fees and the costs ofthis action, pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. § 1988 and Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. \nRespectfully submitted by: \nDated: June 30, 2009  /s/ D. Aaron Rihn.

Miller. [Doc. No. 16].\nUpon consideration of the arguments by the parties, the Court DENIES Defendants’ motion.\nI.\nFACTS\nOn October 9, 2009, Plaintiff Michael Cantley, individually and on behalf of a Class\nof others similarly situated, filed his First Amended Complaint.  In his First Amended Class Action\nComplaint, Plaintiff asserts he was arrested on or about September 28, 2008, on non-felony charges\nof violating a domestic violence protection order.  Plaintiff states he was at his former wife’s house\nin violation of the order, but he did not harm her or anyone else while there.  Following his arrest,\nPlaintiff was taken into custody and placed in a holding cell at the Western Regional Jail, where\nPlaintiff states he has been in custody on several previous occasions.  According to Plaintiff,\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 32   Filed 08/05/10   Page 2 of 29 PageID #: 198\nDefendant WVRJA is responsible for the policies, practices, supervision, implementation, and\nconduct of all matters pertaining to the West Virginia Regional Jail System, which includes the\nWestern Regional Jail.  Defendant Miller is the duly appointed Executive Director and a policy\nmaker for the WVRJA.\nAfter several hours of custody, Plaintiff was required to undergo a visual cavity strip\nsearch (vcs)1 and delousing pursuant to a WVRJA policy.  Although Plaintiff claims his arrest was\nvoid of any reasonable suspicion he possessed any weapons or contraband, the policy required him\nto completely disrobe in front of a correctional officer of the same sex for a visual inspection.\nDuring the inspection, Plaintiff had to lift his arms and legs, spread his butt cheeks, lift up his\ntesticles and bend at the waist.  The correctional officer then sprayed a delousing solution on him\nand required him to shower in view of the officer.  Plaintiff claims that correctional officers receive\nno medical training in applying the delousing solution and the delousing policy is enforced without\n1“A ‘strip search,’ though an umbrella term, generally refers to an inspection of a naked\nindividual, without any scrutiny of the subject's body cavities.  A ‘visual body cavity search’ extends\nto visual inspection of the anal and genital areas.  A ‘manual body cavity search’ includes some\ndegree of touching or probing of body cavities.” Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556, 561 n. 3 (1st Cir.\n1985) (citation omitted).  Although Plaintiff states he was not subjected to a physical cavity search,\nhe makes a cursory statement that he believes some members of the proposed class may have been\nsubject to such a search.  Defendants deny they do physical cavity searches.  In any event, Plaintiff\ndoes not focus on this type of search in his briefing before the Court, and it does not appear that he\nrelies upon this type of search in any of his causes of action.  In the First Amended Complaint,\nPlaintiff states he refers collectively to strip and vcs searches as “strip searches,” and these require\na detainee to manipulate body parts for a visual inspection of the detainee’s genitals and anus.  A\nphysical cavity search is not included in this description.  He then proceeds to discuss only strip and\nvcs searches in his causes of action, with no specific mention of physical cavity searches.  Thus, this\nCourt will not discuss the impact physical cavity searches may have on the constitutional issues\nraised in this case.\n-2-\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 32   Filed 08/05/10   Page 3 of 29 PageID #: 199\nany medical evaluation to determine if lice are present.  Based upon information and belief, Plaintiff\nfurther asserts that the WVJRA uses “Liceall,” which Plaintiff alleges is a caustic solution that can,\nand often does, cause chemical burns, especially when applied to African-Americans.  Following\nhis shower, Plaintiff was issued prison clothing to wear.  Plaintiff remained incarcerated until on or\nabout November 6, 2008, when all charges against him were dismissed.  \nPlaintiff argues the strip search and delousing policy as applied to pretrial detainees\ncharged with misdemeanors or other minor crimes is unconstitutional under the Fourth and\nFourteenth Amendments and 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  As a result of the policy, Plaintiff claims to have\nsuffered psychological pain, humiliation, suffering, and mental anguish.  Plaintiff brings this action\non behalf of himself and others similarly situated seeking declaratory and injunctive relief,\ncompensatory damages, and attorneys’ fees and costs.  On the other hand, Defendants contend that\nthe strip search policy and the delousing procedures are necessary for safety and health reasons.\nThus, Defendants argue the policies do not violate the Fourth Amendment. \nII.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\nIn Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007), the United States Supreme\nCourt disavowed the “no set of facts” language found in Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41 (1957),\nwhich was long used to evaluate complaints subject to 12(b)(6) motions. 550 U.S. at 563.  In its\nplace, courts must now look for “plausibility” in the complaint.  This standard requires a plaintiff\nto set forth the “grounds” for an “entitle[ment] to relief” that is more than mere “labels and\nconclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.” Id. at 555.\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  Accepting the factual allegations in the complaint\n-3-\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 32   Filed 08/05/10   Page 4 of 29 PageID #: 200\nas true (even when doubtful), the allegations “must be enough to raise a right to relief above the\nspeculative level . . . .” Id. (citations omitted).  If the allegations in the complaint, assuming their\ntruth, do “not raise a claim of entitlement to relief, this basic deficiency should . . . be exposed at the\npoint of minimum expenditure of time and money by the parties and the court.” Id. at 558 (internal\nquotation marks and citations omitted).  \nIn Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937 (2009), the Supreme Court explained the\nrequirements of Rule 8 and the “plausibility standard” in more detail.  In Iqbal, the Supreme Court\nreiterated that Rule 8 does not demand “detailed factual allegations[.]” 129 S. Ct. at 1949 (internal\nquotation marks and citations omitted).  However, a mere “unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-\nharmed-me accusation” is insufficient. Id.  “To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must\ncontain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its\nface.’” Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570).  Facial plausibility exists when a claim contains\n“factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable\nfor the misconduct alleged.” Id. (citation omitted).  The Supreme Court continued by explaining that,\nalthough factual allegations in a complaint must be accepted as true for purposes of a motion to\ndismiss, this tenet does not apply to legal conclusions. Id.  “Threadbare recitals of the elements of\na cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.” Id. (citation omitted).\nWhether a plausible claim is stated in a complaint requires a court to conduct a context-specific\nanalysis, drawing upon the court’s own judicial experience and common sense. Id. at 1950.  If the\ncourt finds from its analysis that “the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than\nthe mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged-but it has not ‘show[n]’-‘that the\n-4-\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 32   Filed 08/05/10   Page 5 of 29 PageID #: 201\npleader is entitled to relief.’” Id. (quoting, in part, Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).  The Supreme Court\nfurther articulated that “a court considering a motion to dismiss can choose to begin by identifying\npleadings that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth.\nWhile legal conclusions can provide the framework of a complaint, they must be supported by\nfactual allegations.” Id.\nIII.\nDISCUSSION\nA.\nThe Strip Search Policy\nThe issue facing the Court in this case is whether the alleged blanket strip search and\ndelousing policy is constitutional.  The parties agree that this issue is controlled by the United States\nSupreme Court’s benchmark decision in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979).  In Bell, the Court was\nasked to consider the constitutional rights of pretrial detainees who were subject to a variety of\ncorrectional conditions and practices at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC). 441 U.S. at\n523.2  The Court began by recognizing that, under the Due Process Clause, a condition of\nconfinement for a pretrial detainee cannot amount to a punishment. Id. at 535-36 n.16.  However,\nthe Court was careful to state that not every restriction placed upon a pretrial detainee is a\npunishment under the Constitution.  Clearly, the government must have the power to effectuate\ndetention when necessary.  “Loss of freedom of choice and privacy are inherent incidents of\nconfinement in such a facility.” Id. at 537.  The fact that confinement interferes with a detainee’s\n2MCC was a federally-run short-term facility that primarily housed pretrial detainees. Id.\nThere were, however, some convicted inmates at the facility. Id. at 524.\n-5-\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 32   Filed 08/05/10   Page 6 of 29 PageID #: 202\ncomfort and restraint levels “does not convert the conditions or restrictions of detention into\n‘punishment.’” Id.\nIn determining when the constitutional line is crossed, “[a] court must decide whether\nthe disability is imposed for the purpose of punishment or whether it is but an incident of some other\nlegitimate governmental purpose.” Id. at 538 (citation omitted).  If there is no expressed punitive\nintent, the decision generally will rest on “‘whether an alternative purpose to which [the restriction]\nmay rationally be connected is assignable for it, and whether it appears excessive in relation to the\nalternative purposes assigned [to it].’” Id. (citations omitted).  If a condition or restriction is\nreasonably related to a legitimate governmental goal, “it does not, without more, amount to\n‘punishment.’” Id. at 539 (footnote omitted).  On the other hand, if a condition is arbitrary or\npurposeless or otherwise not reasonably related to a governmental objective, a court “may infer that\nthe purpose of the governmental action is punishment that may not constitutionally be inflicted upon\ndetainees qua detainees.” Id. (citation and footnote omitted).\nWhen deciding whether a particular policy is constitutional, courts also must be\nmindful of the government’s interest in maintaining security and order at the facility and in making\nsure that “no weapons or illicit drugs reach detainees.  Restraints that are reasonably related to the\ninstitution’s interest in maintaining jail security do not, without more, constitute unconstitutional\npunishment, even if they are discomforting and are restrictions that the detainee would not have\nexperienced had he been released while awaiting trial ” Id. at 540 (footnote omitted).  In other\nwords, effective management of a facility “is a valid objective that may justify imposition of\n-6-\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 32   Filed 08/05/10   Page 7 of 29 PageID #: 203\nconditions and restrictions of pretrial detention and dispel any inference that such restrictions are\nintended as punishment.” Id. (footnote omitted).\nThe Court also identified several general principles guiding the constitutionality of\nrestrictions.  First, the Court said “convicted prisoners do not forfeit all constitutional protections\nby reason of their conviction and confinement in prison.” Id. at 545 (citations omitted).  Second,\nalthough inmates maintain some constitutional rights, it “does not mean that these rights are not\nsubject to restrictions and limitations.” Id.  Third, institutional security, order, and discipline are all\n“essential goals that may require limitation or retraction of the retained constitutional rights of both\nconvicted prisoners and pretrial detainees.” Id. at 546.  In this regard, the Court said in a footnote\nthat “[t]here is no basis for concluding that pretrial detainees pose any lesser security risk than\nconvicted inmates.” Id. at 547 n. 28.  Lastly, it is important to recognize that there are not easy\nanswers to operating a correctional facility on a day-to-day basis.  “Prison administrators therefore\nshould be accorded wide-ranging deference in the adoption and execution of policies and practices\nthat in their judgment are needed to preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain\ninstitutional security.” Id. (citations omitted).  The Court cautioned that lower courts must be wary\nthat such management decisions “are peculiarly within the province and professional expertise of\ncorrections officials, and, in the absence of substantial evidence in the record to indicate that the\nofficials have exaggerated their response to these considerations, courts should ordinarily defer to\ntheir expert judgment in such matters.” Id. 547-48 (citations omitted).\n-7-\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 32   Filed 08/05/10   Page 8 of 29 PageID #: 204\nRelying upon this analysis, the Court proceeded to discuss some of the specific issues\nbefore it.  As relevant here, one of those issues involved vcs searches of all inmates at Bureau of\nPrison facilities, including MCC, after every contact visit with an outsider. Id. at 558.  Correctional\nofficials testified such searches were necessary to prevent and deter the smuggling of weapons,\ndrugs, and other contraband into the facilities. Id.  Although the practice gave the Court pause, it\nnonetheless held that it did not violate the reasonableness requirement of the Fourth Amendment for\neither convicted prisoners or pretrial detainees. Id.  Under the Fourth Amendment, reasonableness\n“requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that\nthe search entails.  Courts must consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which\nit is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.” Id. at 559\n(citations omitted).  In acknowledging the security issues arising in a detention facility, the Court\nnoted the prevalence of smuggling items into facilities and stated that “inmate attempts to secrete\nthese items into the facility by concealing them in body cavities are documented in this record and\nin other cases.” Id. (citations omitted).  The Court further said the fact that there was only one\ndocumented instance of an MCC inmate attempting to smuggle in contraband on his person may\ndemonstrate the deterrent effect of the policy. Id.  Balancing the security interests against privacy\ninterests, the Court concluded that a vcs search under the MCC rules can “be conducted on less than\nprobable cause.” Id. at 560.  \nTwo years after the Bell decision, the Fourth Circuit was confronted with the\nreasonableness of a visual strip search in Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007 (4th Cir. 1981).  The\nplaintiff Lucy Logan was involved in an auto accident and was suspected of driving while\n-8-\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 32   Filed 08/05/10   Page 9 of 29 PageID #: 205\nintoxicated (DWI). 660 F.2d at 1009.  Ms. Logan was taken to the Arlington County Detention\nCenter, but refused to take a breathalyzer test.  A magistrate judge issued warrants for DWI and\nrefusal to take the test.  Ms. Logan was booked on the charges, and the magistrate judge ordered her\nreleased on her own recognizance. Id. at 1010.  However, to ensure Ms. Logan’s sobriety, the\nmagistrate judge directed that she could not leave the facility for four hours unless a responsible\nperson picked her up. Id.\nPrior to Ms. Logan being given the opportunity to call someone to pick her up, a\nfemale deputy sheriff inventoried her personal property, took her to a holding cell, and conducted\na visual strip search pursuant to an established policy that all persons held at the Center be strip\nsearched for weapons or contraband regardless of the offense.  The policy was adopted “after a\ndeputy allegedly was shot by a misdemeanant who had not been strip-searched.” Id.  Following the\nsearch, Ms. Logan was allowed to call a friend and was released upon her friend’s arrival. Id.\nThereafter, Ms. Logan filed suit alleging, in part, that the strip search policy was unreasonable in\nits scope and manner. Id. at 1011.  Upon consideration of the evidence, the Fourth Circuit agreed.\nIn so holding, the Fourth Circuit relied upon Bell and found that the “strip search bore\nno . . . discernible relationship to security needs at the Detention Center that, when balanced against\nthe ultimate invasion of personal rights involved, it could reasonably be thought justified.” Id. at\n1013.  The Court noted that detainees, like Ms. Logan, were not intermingled with the general\npopulation,  her  offense  was  not  one  commonly  associated  with  possession  of  weapons  or\ncontraband, there was no reason to believe she was harboring a weapon or contraband, and she was\n-9-\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 32   Filed 08/05/10   Page 10 of 29 PageID #: 206\nat the facility an hour and a half before she was subject to the strip search and she had not even been\npatted down.  The Fourth Circuit held that “[a]n indiscriminate strip search policy routinely applied\nto detainees such as Logan along with all other detainees cannot be constitutionally justified simply\non the basis of administrative ease in attending to security considerations.” Id.  (citation omitted).\nSince Logan was decided in 1981 numerous other district court’s and the vast\nmajority of courts of appeals have found strip searches of pretrial detainees, who are arrested for\nmisdemeanor offenses, unconstitutional in an absence of some particularized suspicion that a\nspecific individual may have contraband.  For instance, in Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d\n1263 (7th Cir. 1984), the Seventh Circuit cited both Bell and Logan in striking down a policy by the\nCity of Chicago that required strip and vcs searches “of all women arrested and detained in the City\nlockups, regardless of the charges against the women and without regard to whether the arresting\nofficers or detention aides had reason to believe that the women were concealing weapons or\ncontraband on their persons.” 723 F.2d at 1266.  \nThe plaintiffs in Mary Beth G. were women arrested on misdemeanor offenses and\nwere detained while awaiting bail money. Id.  The Seventh Circuit observed that the balancing test\nprescribed in . . . [Bell] does not validate strip searches in detention settings per se.”  Id. at 1272\n(citations omitted).  Although the Supreme Court upheld the strip search in Bell, the Seventh Circuit\nstated it did so on much different facts.  Thus, the Court found it necessary to apply the balancing\ntest announced in Bell to the facts before it.  \n-10-\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 32   Filed 08/05/10   Page 11 of 29 PageID #: 207\nIn doing so, the Seventh Circuit remarked that there are few instances that invade an\nindividual’s privacy more than a vcs search.  The City argued, however, that such searches were\nnecessary to prevent misdemeanor offenders from bringing weapons and contraband into the lockup\nfacilities.  Despite these arguments, the Seventh Circuit found that only a few items over the years\nwere ever discovered during a body cavity search of women arrested for minor offenses. Id.  Thus,\nthe Seventh Circuit found using Bell’s balancing test that “the strip searches bore an insubstantial\nrelationship to security needs” and cannot be considered reasonable under these facts. Id. at 1273\n(citing Logan).3 \nMore recently in Allison v. The GEO Group, Inc., 611 F. Supp.2d 433 (E.D. Pa.\n2009), the district court, as here, was confronted with a blanket strip search policy of all arrestees\ndetained at one of the custodial facilities operated by the defendant.  The searches allegedly were\nconducted irrespective of any reasonable suspicion or probable cause that the individual being\nsearched had any contraband. Id. at 438.  The district court recognized that detention situations\nobviously require the curtailment of rights, including personal privacy and Fourth Amendment\nrights.  In addition, courts should limit their roles in the administration of detention facilities. Id. at\n442 (citations omitted).  The court then proceeded to discuss Bell’s reasonableness test and noted\n3The policy also was challenged on equal protection grounds because it did not apply to men.\nId. at 1266.  The Seventh Circuit found, as an additional ground, that the policy violated the\nFourteenth Amendment’s equal protection clause. Id. at 1274.\n-11-\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 32   Filed 08/05/10   Page 12 of 29 PageID #: 208\nthat most courts addressing custodial strip searches have relied upon that test in evaluating claims.\nId. at 448.4   \n4The defendant in Allison, however, argued that Bell no longer controlled such decisions, but\nrather, the court should rely upon the holdings in Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517 (1984), and\nTurner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78 (1987).  \nIn Hudson, the Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality under the Fourth Amendment\nof searching prisoners’ cells.  The Court held that “society is not prepared to recognize as legitimate\nany subjective expectation of privacy that a prisoner might have in his prison cell and that,\naccordingly, the Fourth Amendment proscription against unreasonable searches does not apply\nwithin the confines of the prison cell.” 468 U.S. at 526.  In Turner, inmates had challenged under\nthe First and Fourteenth Amendment certain prison regulations related to inmate marriages and\ninmate-to-inmate correspondence. 482 U.S. at 81.  In that case, the Court announced a four-part test\nto consider in determining the reasonableness of a prison restriction, which includes:  (1) whether\nthere is “a ‘valid, rational connection’ between the prison regulation and the legitimate governmental\ninterest put forward to justify it[;]” (2) “whether there are alternative means of exercising the right\nthat remain open to prison inmates[;]” (3) “the impact accommodation of the asserted constitutional\nright will have on guards and other inmates, and on the allocation of prison resources generally[;]”\nand (4) “the absence of ready alternatives is evidence of the reasonableness of a prison regulation.”\nId. at 89-90 (citations omitted).\nIn rejecting both of these standards in Allison, the district court noted that neither Hudson\nnor Turner overruled Bell’s holding or analysis. 611 F. Supp.2d at 445 & 448.  In fact, a decision\nrendered by the Supreme Court on the same day as Hudson affirmed Bell’s Fourth Amendment\nassumption with regard to searching the cells of pretrial detainees. Id. at 445 (citing Block v.\nRutherford, 468 U.S. 576 (1984)).  In addition, the district court found that the majority of courts\nwhich have considered the impact of Hudson upon Bell have limited Hudson to cell searches and\nhave not extended Hudson’s ruling to the constitutionality of custodial strip searches. Id. (citations\nomitted).  Likewise, the district court found that “Turner cited Bell with approval and did not at any\npoint suggest that Bell’s approach to Fourth Amendment claims should no longer be controlling\nlaw.” Id. at 448.  Moreover, Bell specifically applied in a Fourth Amendment context of a strip\nsearch, while Turner challenged other polices under the First and Fourteenth Amendment, which\nare irrelevant here.  Although the district court noted that both the Second and Ninth Circuit mention\nTurner’s analysis in custodial strip search cases, the district court was not persuaded by their use.\nId. at 447-48 (citing Michenfelder v. Sumner, 860 F.2d 328 (9th Cir. 1988); Iqbal v. Hasty, 490 F.3d\n143 (2d Cir. 2007); and Shain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d 56 (2d Cir. 2001).\nIn this case, Defendants mention Turner in their Memorandum of Law in Support of their\nMotion to Dismiss, however, they assert that “it is not necessary for this Court to evaluate these\nfactors as to the WVRJA strip search policy” because Bell controls. Memorandum of Law, at 14; see\n(continued...)\n-12-\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 32   Filed 08/05/10   Page 13 of 29 PageID #: 209\nIn applying Bell to the facts before it, the district court recognized that a vcs search\nconstitutes an extremely invasive action by the government, and is “grossly disproportionate” when\nsomeone is arrested on a relatively minor offense. Id. at 452-53 (citations omitted).   “Few people\nwould think that their right of privacy in their own body, a ‘cherished value of our society,’ could\nbe jeopardized by the failure to pay parking tickets, shoplifting, or driving without a license.” Id.\n(citation omitted).  However, it is exactly what occurs when a blanket policy in enforced. Id.  The\ndistrict court noted that “[c]ourts that strike down blanket strip search policies for detained arrestees\nconclude that the two justifications which supported the constitutionality of the MCC policy for\ncontact visit strip searches are lacking in the arrestee context.” Id. at 454 (citation omitted).  \nFirst, arrests and detention are usually “unplanned events,” with little opportunity to\nsmuggle contraband. Id. (citations and internal quotation omitted).  In addition, it is likely that any\ncontraband would be uncovered “during a valid search incident to arrest or a less intrusive custodial\nsearch.” Id. (citations omitted).  Moreover, when an individual is arrested on an offense that is not\ncommonly associated with weapons, drugs, or other contraband, “the risk that an arrestee has\nsecreted contraband in such a way that it could only be detected by a strip search shrinks further.”\nId. (citations omitted).  Citing Logan and Mary Beth G., the district court found that “[s]trip\nsearching arrestees who are unlikely to possess, much less conceal, contraband does not serve the\n4(...continued)\nalso Defendants’ Reply in Support of its Motion to Dismiss, at 15 (stating “Bell established the\nframework by which this court must evaluate the WVRJA policy and Bell remains the only\nprecedent that this court should consider”).  Plaintiff also argues that the Hudson and Turner\nstandards are inapplicable.  Upon review, this Court agrees with the parties that Bell controls this\nsituation.\n-13-\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 32   Filed 08/05/10   Page 14 of 29 PageID #: 210\ninstitutional security needs of a custodial facility.” Id. at 454.  Second, the district court noted that,\nas arrests are typically unplanned, there is little deterrent effect as the Supreme Court found in Bell.\nId. at 455; see Bell, 441 U.S. at 559.  Thus, the district court stated that “[t]hese considerations\nsignificantly weaken the effectiveness of a blanket arrestee strip search policy and, therefore, a\ncustodial facility’s justification for enforcing it.” Id.  Balancing these considerations with the\ninvasion of privacy involved in a strip search, and the need for security in custodial facilities, the\ndistrict court agreed with the majority of courts which have determined that blanket strip search\npolicies permitting “indiscriminate searches of arrestees simply do not satisfy the basic Fourth\nAmendment requirement of reasonableness because they subject too many people to highly invasive,\nhumiliating searches that do not actually promote the institutional security interests of the custodial\nfacility.” Id. at 455 & 463.  Accordingly, the district court determined that the plaintiffs pled a viable\nclaim under the Fourth Amendment. Id. at 463.\nIn making its decision, the district court discussed the fact that, at the time, the\nEleventh Circuit was the only circuit court of appeals which had determined it was constitutionally\npermissible to have a policy “of strip searching all arrestees as part of the process of booking them\ninto the general population of a detention facility, even without reasonable suspicion to believe that\nthey may be concealing contraband[.]” Powell v. Barrett, 541 F.3d 1298, 1300 (11th Cir. 2008).  In\nso holding, the Eleventh Circuit stated that “the security needs the Court in Bell found to justify strip\nsearching an inmate re-entering the jail population after a contact visit are no greater than those that\njustify searching an arrestee when he is being booked into the general population for the first time.”\nId. at 1302.  In addition, the court noted the strip searches in Bell actually were more intrusive than\n-14-\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 32   Filed 08/05/10   Page 15 of 29 PageID #: 211\nthe ones challenged in the case before it.  Thus, the Eleventh Circuit found “[i]t follows from the\nBell decision that the less intrusive searches in this case do not violate the Fourth Amendment.” Id.\nAfter briefing was complete in this case, a sharply divided Ninth Circuit in Bull v.\nCity and County of San Francisco, 595 F.3d 964 (9th Cir. 2010), overruled its prior holdings and\njoined the Eleventh Circuit in finding that a policy requiring strip searches of all arrestees placed\nin the general jail population did not violate the Fourth Amendment. 595 F.3d at 982.  According\nto jail administrators, the policy in Bull was instituted because there was a serious problem of\nsmuggling into the jail system. Id. at 966.  Jail administrators also “concluded that, based on their\nexperience, ‘the greatest opportunity for the introduction of drugs and weapons into the jail occurs\nat the point when an arrestee is received into the jail for booking and, thereafter, housing.’” Id. at\n967.\nPreviously, in Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614 (9th Cir. 1984) (per curiam),5 the\nNinth Circuit held that strip searches of an arrestee for a minor offense cannot be justified on the fact\nthe arrestee will be placed in contact with the general inmate population.  Rather, it must be based\nupon individualized reasonable suspicion that the arrestee has contraband. 746 F.2d at 617.  In Bull,\nthe majority found that conclusion was inconsistent with Bell as the Supreme Court made no such\nrequirement.  “Rather, the Supreme Court upheld a policy of strip searching all persons who had\ncontact visits as categorically reasonable under the circumstances in the detention facility. Id.\n5Overruled on other grounds by Hodgers-Durgin v. de la Vina, 199 F.3d 1037, 1040 n. 1 (9th\nCir. 1999 (en banc).\n-15-\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 32   Filed 08/05/10   Page 16 of 29 PageID #: 212\n(citations omitted).  In addition, the Ninth Circuit in Bull disavowed its previous finding “that\narrestees charged with minor offenses ‘pose no security threat to the facility.’” 595 F.3d at 978\n(citing Giles, 746 F.2d at 618) (footnote omitted).  Again, the Ninth Circuit stated that Bell made\nno such requirement and the Supreme Court said nothing about modifying the policy based upon the\nnature of inmate’s underlying offense. Id.  \nNext, the Ninth Circuit found a record of smuggling was not necessary under Bell\nbecause of the deterrent effect a strip search policy may have. Id. at 979.  Lastly, the Ninth Circuit\nrejected its previous finding that arrests are normally unplanned events and, therefore, it is less likely\nthat an arrestee has contraband than an inmate after a contact visit. Id.  In this respect, the majority\nagreed with Eleventh Circuit’s reasoning in Powell which stated the fallacy in the “unplanned event”\nposition is that many individuals know when officers are coming to arrest them on warrants, others\nvoluntarily surrender to police, and some get themselves deliberately arrested.  In addition, even\nthose arrested pursuant to a vehicle stop may have time to hide contraband before an officer reaches\nthe vehicle. Id. at 980 (quoting Powell, 541 F.3d at 1313).  Accordingly, the majority found no\nmeaningful distinction between the policy in Bull and the one in Bell and, therefore, upheld the\npolicy.\nIn a sharply worded dissent, the minority stated there was absolutely no evidence in\nthe record of any arrestee hiding contraband with the intent to smuggle it into jail.  Moreover, there\nwas not anyone in the proposed class who was found to possess contraband when strip searched. Id.\nat 990.  Likewise, there is not even anecdotal support for the notion that some detainees get arrested\n-16-\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 32   Filed 08/05/10   Page 17 of 29 PageID #: 213\nfor the purpose of smuggling contraband into jail. Id. at 998-99.  The dissent stated that all but the\nEleventh Circuit rejected the majority’s approach because “[s]uspicionless, routine, mandatory strip\nsearch policies flatly contradict the balancing of interests that the Supreme Court has instructed us\nto undertake.” Id. at 991.  The majority’s holding simply legitimizes “abusive, unnecessary body\ncavity searches of those who pose no security risk.” Id.  The dissent emphasized the degrading\nnature of strip searches requires a strong justification by the government. Id. at 1001.  However, in\nthe case before it, the dissent found no justification for the policy, “aside from minor bureaucratic\ninconvenience. . . .  Judicial review cannot be halted when the government’s rationale is simply\n‘because I said so.’  Under proper, deferential judicial review, . . . [the] body cavity search policy\ncannot pass constitutional muster.” Id.  In ending, the dissent pointedly stated that “[i]nvading the\nrights of everyone, regardless of whether we have reason to suspect them or not, should give no one\nillusory comfort that we are providing justice for all.” Id. at 1004.6\n Defendant contends that this Court should adopt the Eleventh Circuit’s decision in\nPowell7 as the policy there is substantially similar to the policy at issue here.8  Defendant also asserts\n6The dissent also strongly disagreed with the majority’s suggestion that Turner may supplant\nBell’s analysis.  Although the majority did discuss the factors in Turner, it first concluded under Bell\nthat the strip search policy was reasonable and therefore did not violate the class members’ Fourth\nAmendment rights.” Id. at 975.  The majority then stated that “[b]ecause the Turner factors require\nus to give more deference to detention officials’ determinations than does the balancing test in Bell,\nit is not surprising that our consideration of the Turner factors leads to the same conclusion.” Id. at\n975-76.\n7Presumably, if the Court permitted additional briefing on the issue, Defendants also would\nargue the Court likewise should follow the decision in Bull.\n8Defendants contend that the only difference in the policies is that the WVJRA policy\nrequires searches be conducted in an area not visible to other inmates, prison employees not\n(continued...)\n-17-\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 32   Filed 08/05/10   Page 18 of 29 PageID #: 214\nthe Court should disregard the cases from other jurisdictions because they are factually diverse and\nmany merely challenge the particular conditions of a search rather than whether a policy, on its own,\nis constitutional.  Although the Court recognizes there is a wide variety of factual scenarios and legal\nchallenges in the strip search cases cited by Plaintiff, the overarching theme of those cases is that\nBell’s teaching requires “a detainee held on a misdemeanor charge not related to weapons or drugs\nmay not be strip searched absent individualized reasonable suspicion that he or she is carrying such\ncontraband.” Young v. County of Cook, 616 F. Supp.2d 834, 846 (N.D. Ill. 2009); see also Smith v.\nMontgomery County, Maryland, 643 F. Supp. 435, 440 (D. Md. 1986) (stating “courts have found\nthat strip searches of detainees arrested on minor offenses violate the Fourth Amendment”). \n Although the parties spend a great deal of time discussing cases from other\njurisdictions and those discussions are helpful in framing and understanding the issues, in the end,\nthis Court must be consistent with the Fourth Circuit’s application of Bell.  In quoting Bell, the\nFourth Circuit in Logan held:\nStrip  searches  of  detainees  are  constitutionally\nconstrained  by  due  process  requirements  of\nreasonableness under the circumstances.  “In each\ncase  it  requires  a  balancing  of  the  need  for  the\nparticular search against the invasion of personal\nrights that the search entails.  Courts must consider\nthe scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in\nwhich it is conducted, the justification for initiating it,\nand the place in which it is conducted.”\n8(...continued)\ninvolved in the search, or the public.  In Powell, the searches were conducted with up to forty other\ninmates.  541 F.3d at 1301.\n-18-\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 32   Filed 08/05/10   Page 19 of 29 PageID #: 215\n660 F.2d at 1013 (quoting Bell, 441 U.S. at 559).  The Fourth Circuit then concluded that the\nSheriff’s policy of strip searching “all persons held at the Detention Center for weapons or\ncontraband regardless of their offense” “was conclusively shown to be unconstitutional under the\nstandards laid out in Bell[.]” 660 F.2d at 1010 & 1013.\nDefendants argue, however, that the facts of Logan distinguish it from this case in\nthat, unlike Plaintiff in this case, Ms. Logan was never intermingled with the general population.\nDefendant argues intermingling with the general population increases the security risk and justifies\nthe policy.  However, Plaintiff asserts the proposed class includes all individuals who were strip\nsearched prior to being arraigned and, presumably, many of those individuals were released before\nbeing intermingled.9  Thus, they fall precisely in line with the facts in Logan.\nAssuming, as this Court must for purposes of this motion to dismiss, the truth of\nPlaintiff’s allegation that the policy applies broadly to all pretrial detainees regardless of whether\nthey are intermingled, the policy strikes directly in the face of the policy struck down in Logan.  If\ntrue, the blanket nature of the policy clearly would be unconstitutional.  Nevertheless, Defendant\nargues that Plaintiff’s claim cannot survive because reasonable suspicion existed to strip search him\nin this case.  Defendants make a number of factual allegations against Plaintiff which they assert\nwarranted the search.  In his First Amended Class Action Complaint, Plaintiff alleges his “arrest was\n9In paragraph 31 of the First Amended Class Action Complaint, Plaintiff alleges “[t]he strip\nsearches and delousing discussed in this complaint are often imposed upon pre-trial detainees prior\nto their arraignment before a judge.  Upon information and belief, many members of the proposed\nclass are bailed out of custody shortly after being arraigned.” First Amended Class Action\nComplaint, at ¶ 31.\n-19-\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 32   Filed 08/05/10   Page 20 of 29 PageID #: 216\nvoid of any reasonable suspicion that he harbored any weapons or contraband.” First Amended Class\nAction Complaint, at ¶ 38, in part.10  Again, for purposes of a motion to dismiss, this Court must\naccept the truth of Plaintiff’s allegations.  Having done so, the Court DENIES Defendant’s motion\nto dismiss with respect to Plaintiff’s challenge of the strip search policy.\nB.\nThe Delousing Policy\nThe next issue the Court must address is whether Defendants’ delousing policy is\nunconstitutional.  The Court recognizes there are few cases which discuss delousing policies and the\nparties cite none within this circuit.  In support of their motion, Defendants rely upon Russell v.\nRichards, 384 F.3d 444 (7th Cir. 2004).  In Russell, the Seventh Circuit was asked to consider\nwhether a “jail’s policy of directing that all incoming inmates to use a delousing shampoo violated\ntheir Fourteenth Amendment due process right to be free from unwanted medical treatment.” 384\nF.3d at 446.  The plaintiffs in Russell were minor, non-violent offenders who were arrested and\ntaken to jail.  Upon arrival, incoming inmates were given a cup of Liceall and told to apply it to their\nscalp and then shower it out.  There was no monitoring of its use and no way to verify that the\ninmates actually used it.  In addition, although inmates were not told they can refuse to use it, the\njail’s position was that they may refuse. Id.\n10In addition, although Defendants contend that Plaintiff’s arrest and actions on September\n28, 2008, provided reasonable suspicion for the strip search, Plaintiff maintains that he was held at\nWVRJA facilities on multiple occasions and counsel has not had the opportunity to take any\ndiscovery into the circumstances of those other instances.  In addition, Plaintiff argues that he will\ndemonstrate that the facts now cited by Defendants are nothing more than a post hoc effort to justify\nhis strip search and delousing under the blanket policy.  Specifically, Plaintiff asserts that it is not\neven known yet whether the correctional officers knew what he was charged with when he entered\nthe facility.  Plaintiff argues that these are all issues for which discovery is appropriate and which\nare more properly dealt with on a motion for summary judgment, not a motion to dismiss.\n-20-\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 32   Filed 08/05/10   Page 21 of 29 PageID #: 217\nThe jail administrators justified their policy on the grounds that they were trying to\nprevent lice infestations, which, if they occur, are difficult and time consuming to ameliorate.  Id.\nHowever, the manner in which they attempted to prevent infestations through the policy had some\nserious flaws.  In addition to the fact that there was no effort made to ensure incoming inmates\nactually used the delousing solution, the instructions for Liceall were not followed.  For instance,\ninmates were never told they had to leave it on their hair for ten minutes and were not given a\nsecond application.  In addition, inmates were not told to put Liceall on other parts of their bodies\nwhere lice may be present. Id.  The instructions also cautioned that individuals allergic to ragweed\ncould have a reaction, but inmates were never given this warning. Id. at 446-47.\nIn discussing the policy, the Seventh Circuit assumed without deciding that the\napplication of Liceall constitute a medical treatment, which implicates an “inmate’s constitutionally-\nprotected interest in refusing unwanted medical treatment.  Id. at 447 (citations and footnote\nomitted).  The Seventh Circuit then proceeded to discuss the policy under the test announced in\nTurner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78 (1987), to determine its reasonableness.  The reasonableness test under\nTurner includes: (1) whether there is “a ‘valid, rational connection’ between the prison regulation\nand the legitimate governmental interest put forward to justify it[;]” (2) “whether there are\nalternative means of exercising the right that remain open to prison inmates[;]” (3) “the impact\naccommodation of the asserted constitutional right will have on guards and other inmates, and on\nthe allocation of prison resources generally[;]” and (4) “the absence of ready alternatives is evidence\nof the reasonableness of a prison regulation.”  482 U.S. at 89-90 (citations omitted).\n-21-\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 32   Filed 08/05/10   Page 22 of 29 PageID #: 218\nAnalyzing  factors  (1),  (3),  and  (4),11  the  Seventh  Circuit  found  there  was  a\nsatisfactory justification between the policy and the jail’s justification for it despite the problems\nnoted with how it was being administered. 384 F.3d at 448 & 450.  Specifically, the Seventh Circuit\nstated that if inmates were accommodated by being told they could refuse treatment, it could result\nin lice infestations. Id. at 448-49.  In addition, the Seventh Circuit found no evidence in the record\nas to the effectiveness or cost of directing examinations for lice prior to using the solution so that\nit only would be given to those actually infected.  Indeed, the Seventh Circuit observed that some\ninmates may consider a close examination of their hair more intrusive then just being given the\ntreatment. Id. at 449.  Therefore, the Seventh Circuit concluded “the record  . . . [did] not support\nthe conclusion that the jail’s policy with respect to delousing shampoo amounts to an unreasonable\nintrusion on an inmate’s constitutional rights.” Id.\nPlaintiff argues that Russell is distinguishable from this case because it was brought\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment and the inmates were given the product to apply themselves and\nthere was no monitoring by prison personnel.  To the contrary, Plaintiff points out he has filed a\nFourth Amendment challenge to the policy and it involves prison officials spraying the product on\nnaked detainees.  In support of his position that this policy is unconstitutional, Plaintiff cites Doan\nv. Watson, 168 F. Supp.2d 932 (S.D. In. 2001).12\n11The Seventh Circuit stated that factor number 2 is irrelevant in the context of involuntary\nmedical treatment. Id. at 448 n. 2 (citing Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210 (1990)).\n12Plaintiff also cites Wilson v. County of Gloucester, 256 F.R.D. 479 (D. N.J. 2009), and\nGwiazdowski v. County of Chester, 263 F.R.D. 178 (E.D. Pa. 2009).  In Wilson, the district court\nfound common issues of law and fact for class action purposes exist as to the purpose of supervised\n(continued...)\n-22-\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 32   Filed 08/05/10   Page 23 of 29 PageID #: 219\nIn Doan, individuals arrested on misdemeanor offenses were strip searched, sprayed\nwith a delousing solution, and then told to shower. 168 F. Supp.2d at 933.  The district court found\n“the delousing procedure included the essential elements of the strip search” and, therefore, the\nFourth Amendment and Bell’s reasonableness test applied. Id. at 936.  Finding the strip searches in\nDoan “closely resemble the searches at issue in Mary Beth G., the district court found the defendants\nfailed to “demonstrate[] any factual basis to relate the blanket strip search policy to legitimate\nsecurity interests.” Id. at 936.  Without any further discussion about the reasonableness under Bell\nof the delousing policy, the district court found it violated the Fourth Amendment right against\nunreasonable searches. Id. at 937.\nAs the current action challenges the delousing policy on Fourth Amendment grounds,\nthe Court finds that the reasonableness test in Bell is more relevant than the test announced in\nTurner.  However, there is no record in this case upon which this Court can apply Bell’s test.  Based\nupon Plaintiff’s allegations, the delousing policy was a blanket policy which applied to pretrial\ndetainees prior to arraignment with some of those detainees presumably being released without ever\nbeing housed with the general population.  At first glance, a court may sweep this challenge up with\nthe strip search challenge and declare it unreasonable.  However, such result does not take into\naccount that Defendants should be given the opportunity to present evidence and arguments\n12(...continued)\nshower and delousing policies. 263 F.R.D. at 486.  In Gwiazdowski, the district court found the\ndelousing policy, which required a visual inspection of the inmate for wounds and sores, a strip\nsearch.  Nevertheless, it did not decide whether the policy violated the Fourth Amendment’s\nreasonableness standard.  It stated its finding was only relevant for class certification purposes, and\nit did not bind the finder of fact on the merits. 263 F.R.D. at 186.\n-23-\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 32   Filed 08/05/10   Page 24 of 29 PageID #: 220\njustifying the delousing policy on its own merits.13  The Court will not sit and ponder all the possible\njustifications and evidence that Defendants may cite in support of its delousing policy.  Suffice it\nto say, the Court believes it is necessary to independently examine the reasonableness of the\ndelousing policy.14  Therefore, the Court DENIES Defendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s\nchallenge of this policy.\nC.\nImmunity\nDefendants further assert that Plaintiff’s claims against them are barred under the\nEleventh Amendment and Will v. Michigan Department of State Police, 491 U.S. 58 (1989).  In Will,\nthe Supreme Court stated “that neither a State nor its officials acting in their official capacities are\n‘persons’ under § 1983.” 491 U.S. at 71.  It is well established that the WVRJA is an agency of the\nState of West Virginia and is not a “person” within the meaning of § 1983 for purposes of an action\nseeking money damages. See Roach v. Burke, 825 F. Supp. 116, 118 (N.D. W. Va. 1993) (holding\nthat the WVRJA is not a person amenable to suit under § 1983); see also Lavender v. West Virginia\nReg’l Jail Auth. and Corr. Facility Auth., No. 3:06-1032,  2008 WL 313957 (S.D. W. Va. 2008)\n(same).  “An individual defendant employed . . . [by the WVRJA] and sued in his official capacity\nis also immune from suit in federal court under the Eleventh Amendment.” Edwards v. West\n13For instance, the Court can imagine Defendants may attempt to distinguish delousing from\na search for weapons on the basis that, merely because someone is arrested on a misdemeanor, it\ndoes not mean they are any less likely to have lice as some courts have held is the situation in\nsearching for weapons and other contraband.\n14To be clear, the Court is not saying that a detainee being nude in front of a prison official\nis not a factor the Court will consider in weighing the reasonableness of the delousing policy.\nHowever, it is but one of the many factors the Court must consider in applying the reasonableness\ntest.\n-24-\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 32   Filed 08/05/10   Page 25 of 29 PageID #: 221\nVirginia, No. 2:00-0775, 2002 WL 34364404 (S.D. W. Va. 2002).  Thus, a claim for money\ndamages against these Defendants acting in their official capacity is barred by the Eleventh\nAmendment. See Gillette v. West Virginia, No. Civ. A. 2:01-1309, 2003 WL 23522062 (S.D. W. Va.\nJune 6, 2003) (holding the WVRJA “is an agency of the State . . . . [and] [a] . . . suit for money\ndamages is barred by the Eleventh Amendment”). \nHowever, as pointed out by Plaintiff, he has not filed any claims for monetary relief\nunder § 1983 against Defendants in their official capacities.  Rather, his claims against both\nDefendants in their official capacities are for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief.  The\nSupreme Court in Will very clearly held that “a state official in his or her official capacity, when\nsued for injunctive relief, would be a person under § 1983 because ‘official-capacity actions for\nprospective relief are not treated as actions against the State.’” Will, 491 U.S. at 71 n.10 (citation\nomitted); see also Frew v. Hawkins, 540 U.S. 431, 437 (2004) (stating “[t]o ensure the enforcement\nof federal law, however, the Eleventh Amendment permits suits for prospective injunctive relief\nagainst state officials acting in violation of federal law”).  Accordingly, the Court DENIES\nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s claims against them in their official capacities.\nDefendant Miller also moves to dismiss the claim against him in his individual\ncapacity on the basis of qualified immunity.  Defendant Miller asserts that it is clear the allegations\nagainst him are made for actions he took in furtherance of his official duties and not because he, in\nhis individual capacity, deprived Plaintiff of any rights.  However, the Eleventh Amendment does\nnot bar suits under § 1983 for money damages against defendants sued in their individual capacities\n-25-\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 32   Filed 08/05/10   Page 26 of 29 PageID #: 222\nmerely because “the alleged wrongdoing was conducted while in performance of their official\ncapacity.” Roach, 825 F. Supp. at 118; Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, 27 (1991) (rejecting the\npetitioner’s argument that “[u]nder Will, . . . state officials may not be held liable in their personal\ncapacity for actions they take in their official capacity”).  The doctrine of qualified immunity,\nhowever, does protect public officials performing discretionary functions from civil liability if they\ncan show that their conduct did “not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of\nwhich a reasonable person would have known.” Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 609 (1999); (quoting\nHarlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982)).  \nThe threshold question a court must answer when qualified immunity is raised is:\n“Taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, do the facts alleged show the\nofficer's conduct violated a constitutional right?” Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001).15  If the\nanswer to this question is no, the inquiry ends. Id.  If, on the other hand, the answer is yes, then the\ncourt must determine whether the right was clearly established in the specific context of the case.\nId.\nIn this case, there are two alleged actions which the Court will address separately for\nqualified immunity purposes.  The first action is the actual strip search.  As discussed above, taking\nPlaintiff’s allegations as true, the Court has no difficulty finding the strip search policy violates a\n15Although it often will be appropriate to conduct the qualified immunity analysis by first\ndetermining whether a constitutional violation occurred and by next determining whether the\nconstitutional right was clearly established, the order of that two-step protocol is no longer\nmandatory. Pearson v. Callahan, 129 S. Ct. 808 (2009) (overruling Saucier).\n-26-\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 32   Filed 08/05/10   Page 27 of 29 PageID #: 223\nconstitutional right and such right was clearly established under Logan.  As governmental officials\nare held to have “presumptive knowledge of and respect for ‘basic, unquestioned constitutional\nrights,’” and may be liable for constitutional violations when they “‘knew or reasonably should have\nknown’” their actions violated those rights,16 the Court DENIES Defendant Miller’s Motion to\nDismiss with respect to the strip search policy. \nThe second action is the delousing policy.  As mentioned above, there are very few\ncases which discuss delousing policies and there do not appear to be any cases on point within the\nFourth Circuit.  Thus, even if the Court were to presume at this point in the litigation that the\ndelousing policy violates a constitutional right, the Court finds it highly unlikely that a reasonable\nperson would have notice of that violation.  Nevertheless, as the Court has denied Defendants’\nMotion to Dismiss with respect to the delousing policy, the Court also DENIES Defendant Miller’s\nqualified immunity argument with respect to this policy.  The Court believes this issue is best\nresolved after the Court decides the underlying issue regarding the policy itself, which will give both\nparties the opportunity to present evidence and arguments in support of their positions. See Amaechi\nv. West, 237 F.3d 356, 362-63 (2001) (stating that the concept of “clearly established” includes those\nrights previously adjudicated and “those manifestly included within more general applications of\nthe core constitutional principle invoked” which would provide notice to a reasonable person in the\nofficial’s position that certain conduct violates those rights (citations and internal quotation marks\nomitted)). \n16Harlow, 457 U.S. at 815 (quoting Wood v. Strickland, 420 U.S. 308, 322 (1975) (emphasis\nin Harlow deleted).\n-27-\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 32   Filed 08/05/10   Page 28 of 29 PageID #: 224\nD.\nThe PLRA\nDefendants further argue Plaintiff’s action must be dismissed because he failed to\nexhaust his administrative remedies under the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA).  Section\n1997e(a) of the PLRA provides:  \nNo action shall be brought with respect to\nprison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or\nany other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any\njail, prison, or other correctional facility until such\nadministrative  remedies  as  are  available  are\nexhausted.\n42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a).  However, Plaintiff was no longer an inmate at the time he filed this action.\nTherefore, the PLRA is not applicable. See Cofield v. Bowser, 247 Fed. Appx. 413, 414, 2007 WL\n2710423, *1 (4th Cir. 2007) (unpublished) (stating because the plaintiff “was not a prisoner when\nhe filed his complaint, the PLRA exhaustion requirement is not applicable to his § 1983 action.  A\nformer inmate who has been released is no longer ‘incarcerated or detained’ for the purposes of\n§ 1997e(h) and therefore does not qualify as a ‘prisoner’ subject to the PLRA”); Shembo v. Bailey,\nNo. 3:07cv543-RJC, 2009 WL 129974, *2 (W.D. N.C. Jan. 20, 2009) (same).  Accordingly, the\nCourt DENIES Defendants’ motion on exhaustion grounds.\nIII.\nCONCLUSION\nAccordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES Defendants’ Motion to\nDismiss.\n-28-\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 32   Filed 08/05/10   Page 29 of 29 PageID #: 225\nThe Court DIRECTS the Clerk to send a copy of this Order to counsel of record and\nany unrepresented parties.\nENTER: August 5, 2010\nROBERT C.

CIVIL  ACTION  NO.  3:09-0758\nTHE WEST VIRGINIA REGIONAL JAIL AND\nCORRECTIONAL FACILITY AUTHORITY; \nTERRY L. MILLER, both individually and in his\nofficial capacity as Executive Director of the\nWest Virginia Regional Jail and Correctional\nFacility Authority; JOSEPH A. DELONG, both \nindividually and in his capacity as Acting Executive \nDirector of the West Virginia Regional Jail \nand Correctional Facility Authority; and LARRY\nPARSONS, both individually and in his\nofficial capacity as Executive Director of the\nWest Virginia Regional Jail and Correctional\nFacility Authority,\nDefendants.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\nPending before the Court are the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment. ECF\nNos. 149 & 157.  The Court held a hearing on the motions on September 19, 2013.  Based upon the\narguments of the parties and evidence submitted, the Court GRANTS the motion by Defendants The\nWest Virginia Regional Jail and Correctional Authority (WVRJA), Terry L. Miller, Joseph A.\n\nDeLong, and Larry Parsons1 and DENIES the like motion by Plaintiffs Michael Cantley and Floyd\nTeter. \nI.\nFACTUAL AND \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\nThe procedural history of this case was set forth recently in this Court’s Memorandum\nOpinion and Order entered on May 30, 2013 (ECF No. 107), denying Defendants’ Renewed Motion\nto Dismiss Plaintiffs’ Third Amended Complaint.  To briefly reiterate, this action was filed on July\n1, 2009, by Plaintiff Michael Cantley, individually and on behalf of a class of others similarly\nsituated, against the WVRJA and Mr. Miller.  In his First Amended Class Action Complaint filed on\nOctober 9, 2009, Plaintiff Cantley claimed he was arrested on or about September 28, 2008, on non-\nfelony charges and was required to undergo a visual cavity strip search2 and delousing pursuant to a\nWVRJA policy.  Plaintiff Cantley claimed that the WVRJA policy of strip searching and delousing\npretrial detainees charged with misdemeanors or other minor crimes is unconstitutional under the\nFourth and Fourteenth Amendments and 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n1Mr. Miller was the Executive Director of the WVRJA at the time Plaintiffs Cantley and Teter\nwere detained.  Mr. DeLong served as the Executive Director after Mr. Miller until Mr. Parsons was\nnamed as the Executive Director.  Later, Mr. DeLong was renamed as the Executive Director and is\ncurrently serving in that position.\n2“A ‘strip search,’ though an umbrella term, generally refers to an inspection of a naked\nindividual, without any scrutiny of the subject's body cavities.  A ‘visual body cavity search’ extends\nto visual inspection of the anal and genital areas.  A ‘manual body cavity search’ includes some\ndegree of touching or probing of body cavities.” Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556, 561 n.3 (1st Cir.\n1985) (citation omitted). \n2\n\nDefendants WVRJA and Mr. Miller filed a motion to dismiss.  On August 5, 2010, the\nCourt denied the motion. Cantley v. W. Va. Reg’l Jail & Corr. Fac. Auth., 728 F. Supp. 2d 803 (S.D.\nW. Va. 2010).  Discovery proceeded in this case until June 1, 2011, when the Court signed the parties’\nproposed stipulation to stay further proceedings in this matter until after the United States Supreme\nCourt issued a decision in Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders, another strip search case in a\njail setting.  The Supreme Court issued its decision on April 2, 2012. Florence v. Bd. of Chosen\nFreeholders, 132 S. Ct. 1510 (2012).  In the interim period, the Court permitted Floyd Teter to be\nadded as a class representative in a Second Amended Complaint. ECF Nos. 65 & 66.  Mr. Teter  also\nalleges that he was arrested on non-felony charges, subjected to a visual cavity search, and sprayed\nwith a delousing solution prior to being arraigned.\nIn light of the Supreme Court’s decision in Florence, the Court permitted Plaintiffs\nto amend and file a Third Amended Complaint, in which Defendants DeLong and Parsons were\nadded. ECF No. 89.  The Court also entered a new Scheduling Order.  Thereafter, Defendants filed\nanother motion to dismiss the Third Amended Complaint.  The Court denied the motion on May 30,\n2013, and the parties proceeded with discovery.  The parties now have filed cross-motions for\nsummary judgment.  Although this case was filed as a putative class action, a class has not been\ncertified and the only claims before the Court are the individual claims of Plaintiff Cantley and\nPlaintiff Teter.  Therefore, the Court restricts its decision in this matter to the individual claims of\nPlaintiffs Cantley and Teter. See Wooden v. Bd. of Regents of the Univ. Sys. of Ga., 247 F.3d 1262,\n1289 (11th Cir. 2001) (“[T]he district court is not required to resolve . . . [Plaintiff’s] class\ncertification request before resolving a challenge to . . . [Plaintiff’s] individual claim.  If the district\ncourt were to resolve a summary judgment in Defendants' favor and in so doing dismiss . . .\n3\n\n[Plaintiff’s] individual claim before ruling on class certification, then . . . [Plaintiff] would not be an\nappropriate class representative.”)\nII.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\nTo obtain summary judgment, the moving party must show that there is no genuine\nissue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 56(a).  In considering a motion for summary judgment, the Court will not “weigh the\nevidence and determine the truth of the matter.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249\n(1986).  Instead, the Court will draw any permissible inference from the underlying facts in the light\nmost favorable to the nonmoving party. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475\nU.S. 574, 587-88 (1986).\nAlthough the Court will view all underlying facts and inferences in the light most\nfavorable to the nonmoving party, the nonmoving party nonetheless must offer some “concrete\nevidence from which a reasonable juror could return a verdict in his [or her] favor.” Anderson, 477\nU.S. at 256.  Summary judgment is appropriate when the nonmoving party has the burden of proof\non an essential element of his or her case and does not make, after adequate time for discovery, a\nshowing sufficient to establish that element. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986). \nThe nonmoving party must satisfy this burden of proof by offering more than a mere “scintilla of\nevidence” in support of his or her position. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252.\n4\n\nIII.\nDISCUSSION\nA.\nThe Florence Decision\nBefore discussing the specific facts of this case, it is important for the Court to analyze\nthe Supreme Court’s recent decision in Florence.  As this Court explained in its May 30, 2013\nMemorandum Opinion and Order, the Supreme Court in Florence was asked to determine whether\nall detainees who are admitted to the general jail3 population may be compelled to undress and submit\nto a close visual inspection. 132 S. Ct. at 1513.   In that case, Albert W. Florence was arrested on an\noutstanding warrant, which inexplicitly remained in a computer database despite the fact the\nunderlying reason for the warrant was resolved. Id. at 1514.  Upon his arrest, Mr. Florence was\nconfined at the Burlington County Detention Center in New Jersey for six days and then was\ntransferred to the Essex County Correctional Facility. Id.  \nPursuant to the procedures at the Burlington County jail, every arrestee was required\n“to shower with a delousing agent.” Id.  As an arrestee disrobed, officers examined the  individual “for\nscars, marks, gang tattoos, and contraband.” Id.  Mr. Florence also said he was directed “to open his\nmouth, lift his tongue, hold out his arms, turn around, and lift his genitals[,]” although it was not clear\nwhether these requirements were normal practice. Id. (citations omitted).  During his detention, Mr.\nFlorence “shared a cell with at least one other person and interacted with other inmates[.]” Id. at 1513.\n3The Supreme Court used a broad meaning of the word “jail” to include prisons and detention\nfacilities. 132 S. Ct. at 1513.\n5\n\nSimilarly, when Mr. Florence was transferred to the Essex County Correctional\nFacility, he was placed in a holding cell, instructed to disrobe, and subjected to a visual inspection\n“for body markings, wounds, and contraband” while “an officer looked at . . . [his] ears, nose, mouth,\nhair, scalp, fingers, hands, arms, armpits, and other body openings” without touching him. Id. at 1514\n(citation omitted).  “This policy applied regardless of the circumstances of the arrest, the suspected\noffense, or the detainee’s behavior, demeanor, or criminal history.” Id.  Mr. Florence then was\nrequired to shower (while his clothes were inspected) and, thereafter,  was admitted to the Essex\nfacility.  Mr. Florence was released the following day, after the charges were dismissed. Id.   \nMr. Florence brought an action challenging the policy requiring visual cavity strip\nsearches of those arrested for minor offenses, without any reason to believe the arrestee was harboring\nweapons, drugs, or contraband. Id. at 1514-15.  The district court certified a class and, after discovery,\nruled on summary judgment that the policy violated the Fourth Amendment. Id. at 1515.  The United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, finding the procedure “struck a reasonable\nbalance between inmate privacy and the security needs of the two jails.” Id. (citation omitted).  The\nThird Circuit premised its holding on finding that the searches occurred prior to an arrestee’s\nadmission into the general population.  Mr. Florence did not dispute this premise. Id.\nIn ruling on the constitutionality of the policy, the Supreme Court acknowledged the\ndifficulties in operating and maintaining safety in detention facilities, which “requires the expertise\nof correctional officials, who must have substantial discretion to devise reasonable solutions to the\nproblems they face.” Id.  The Supreme Court emphasized its position of giving deference to\ncorrectional authorities and upholding regulations that impinge upon the constitutional rights of\n6\n\ninmates if they are “‘reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.’” Id. (quoting Turner v.\nSafley, 482 U.S. 78, 89 (1987) (other citations omitted)).  In addition, the Supreme Court  recognized\nthere is no mechanical test to determine the reasonableness of an intrusion into an inmate’s privacy.\nId. at 1516 (citing Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979)).  Rather, “[t]he need for a particular\nsearch must be balanced against the resulting invasion of personal rights.” Id. (citing Bell, 441 U.S.\nat 559).  \nUtilizing this balancing test, the Supreme Court upheld “[p]olicies designed to keep\ncontraband out of jails and prisons.” Id. (citing Block v. Rutherford, 468 U.S. 576 (1984) (banning\ncontact visits); Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517 (1984) (upholding random searches of inmates’\nlockers and cells)).  The Supreme Court recognized that its prior “cases establish that correctional\nofficials must be permitted to devise reasonable search policies to detect and deter the possession of\ncontraband in their facilities.” Id. at 1517 (citation omitted).  In addition, the reasonableness of a\npolicy, when juxtaposed to legitimate security concerns, lies within the realm and expertise of those\nofficials.  Further, the Supreme Court repeatedly admonished that “in the absence of substantial\nevidence in the record to indicate that the officials have exaggerated their response to these\nconsiderations courts should ordinarily defer to their expert judgment in such matters.” Id. (citations\nomitted).\nApplying this standard, the Supreme Court stated that admitting a new detainee to the\ninmate population creates numerous risks to staff, other inmates, and the new detainee. Id. at 1518.\nGiven that facilities “are often crowded, unsanitary, and dangerous places,” there is a significant\ninterest on the part of correctional officials to conduct a thorough search during the intake process.\n7\n\nId. at 1520.  Specifically, the Court stated that “[t]he danger of introducing lice or contagious\ninfections, for example, is well documented.” Id. at 1518 (citations omitted).  Likewise, the Court\nnoted that visually inspecting tattoos to identify gang affiliation is a reasonable requirement during\nthe intake process to protect everyone at the facility. Id. at 1519.  Moreover, screening for contraband\nduring intake is a most serious duty, and some inmates who may be believed to be the lowest risk are\nactually dangerous criminals and may be caught bringing contraband into jail. Id. at 1519-20.  The\nCourt noted that, not only do those arrested for minor offenses have the same incentive to conceal\ncontraband, they may be coerced to hide contraband if it is known they are not subject to the same\nsearches as others.  Therefore, to carve out an exception to a standard search protocol for those\narrested for minor offenses opens the door for those arrestees to being asked or coerced into bringing\ncontraband into the facilities because it will be well known that they will not be searched. Id. at 1520-\n21.\nIn addition, the Court recognized that, practically speaking, it may be difficult to make\ninmate classifications based upon current and prior offenses before an intake search is conducted.  Id.\nat 1521.  Moreover, in the case before it, criminal history records were not available to the intake\nofficers conducting searches and, even if they were available, they may be inaccurate or incomplete.\nId. (citations omitted).  Without reliable information about the arrestees’ records, the Court found “it\nwould be illogical to require officers to assume the arrestees in front of them do not pose a risk of\nsmuggling something into the facility.” Id.  Furthermore, even if reliable records are available,\nrequiring officers to make quick decisions on whether the arrestee’s record requires a search raises\nserious difficulties with implementation and opens the door to potential charges of discrimination. Id.\nat 1521-22 (citation omitted).  Therefore, for all of these reasons, the Supreme Court affirmed the\n8\n\nThird Circuit’s decision finding the procedure was a reasonable balance between the need for security\nand inmate privacy. Id. at 1523.  In doing so, the Court specifically stated it was not ruling on a\nsituation in which the arrestee’s detention had “not yet been reviewed by a magistrate or other judicial\nofficer, and who can be held in available facilities removed from the general population[.]” Id. at\n1523.  In addition, in their concurring opinions, both Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito\nemphasized that the Court was not foreclosing the possibility of an exception when a detainee has\nbeen arrested for a minor offense, the detention has not yet been reviewed by a judicial officer, and\nthe detainee may be placed in an alternative facility away from the general inmate population. Id. at\n1523-24.\nB.\nSearch of Mr. Cantley\nApplying Florence to the present case, the Court considers separately the facts related\nto the named Plaintiffs’ strip search claims.  With respect to Mr. Cantley, it is undisputed that he was\narrested on non-felony charges of violating a domestic protection order on September 28, 2008. \nFollowing his arrest, Mr. Cantley was taken before a magistrate for his arraignment.  Afterwards, he\nwas admitted to the Western Regional Jail pursuant to a Jail Commitment Order signed by the\nmagistrate judge.4\n4Plaintiff Cantley also makes a general statement in his Third Amended Complaint that he\n“was admitted to the Western Regional Jail on other occasions during the class period, and was strip\nsearched and deloused prior to being arraigned before a judicial officer.” Third Amend. Compl. ¶ 50. \nHe further states that on some occasions he was admitted for misdemeanor or other minor crimes and\nthere was no reasonable suspicion to search him. Id. ¶ 51.  Although Plaintiff Cantley makes these\ngeneral statements, it is clear the focus of his claim, and the focus of discovery, always has been his\ndetention on September 28.  Other than some records showing he was admitted to the facility on\nmultiple occasions, Plaintiff Cantley makes these self-serving allegations with no real supporting\nevidence.  Therefore, to the extent Mr. Cantley is now attempting to argue there were other occasions\nin which he was improperly strip searched and deloused, the Court rejects those arguments as being\n(continued...)\n9\n\nLieutenant C.E. Aldridge, who is assigned to the Western Regional Jail and named as\none of Defendants’ Rule 30(b)(6) designees, stated in his deposition that, if a detainee had a\ncommitment order from a magistrate judge (as was the case with Mr. Cantley), the detainee, upon\nentry to the facility, was given a pat down search.5  The detainee also was asked if he or she needed\nany medical attention and was given a quick medical assessment.  If deemed fit for incarceration, the\narresting officer was permitted to leave, and jail officials began the booking process.  The detainee\nhad his or her fingerprints and photographs taken, and the detainee’s information was entered in the\njail’s computer system (referred to as the TAG system).  The detainee was then taken to a shower area\nand visually strip searched and deloused.  During this process, the detainee was given a prison\nuniform, and the detainee’s clothes were checked for contraband and placed in a property bag.\nLt. Aldridge further stated in his deposition that he was aware of incidents where\nweapons were found in duffle bags and in ankle holsters and instances in which pills were found.  He\nalso recounted a recent incident in which a temporary female detainee, who had not been arraigned,\nhad a cigarette fall out of her bra.  As a result, she was strip searched and a lighter and dice were\nfound on her person and cash was found in her vagina.6 \n4(...continued)\ninsufficiently pled as a matter of law.\n5Lt. Aldridge stated jail officials also take the detainee’s personal property and shoes, but the\ndetainee is kept in his or her clothes during this time.\n6Although the woman was a pre-arraignment detainee, Lt. Aldridge stated she was searched\nbecause the cigarette fell out of her bra, which gave the booking officer reasonable suspicion to search\nher.\n10\n\nUpon his arrival at the Western Regional Jail, Mr. Cantley stated in his deposition that\nhe was patted down and booked into the facility.  According to an Incident Report filed by booking\nofficer Corporal Ferrell, Mr. Cantley cursed at the deputy upon entry to the facility.  Cpl. Ferrell\ninitially was able to calm Mr. Cantley down, but he then began cursing and making threatening\nstatements.  Mr. Cantley was cleared by a nurse and placed in a holding cell.  However, Mr. Cantley\nbegan kicking the cell door.  Despite being told to stop, Mr. Cantley refused to do so and, ultimately,\nhe was placed in a restraint chair.  When a nurse attempted to check Mr. Cantley, he tried to grab her\nhand.  According to Cpl. Ferrell, Mr. Cantley yelled, cursed, and struggled to get out of the chair for\nan hour and a half.  The Inmate Special Watch Log indicates that, during that time, he also threatened\nto strangle an officer.  He was removed from the chair fifteen minutes after he calmed down.  In his\ndeposition, Mr. Cantley said that, except for a few minor differences, the Incident Report was\naccurate.7\nMr. Cantley testified that, prior to being admitted to the general housing population,\nhe was strip searched and deloused.  The strip search entailed him removing his clothing in a private\nshower area where he could not be seen by other detainees.  After disrobing, he handed his clothes\nto a male correctional officer who checked his clothes for contraband.  Mr. Cantley stated there was\nonly one correctional officer in the room with him.  Mr. Cantley was then subjected to a visual\ninspection by the same officer, which included Mr. Cantley raising his scrotum, bending over, and\ncoughing.  There are no allegations that the officer ever touched Mr. Cantley during the process. \nAfter the visual inspection, Mr. Cantley stated he was asked to walk over to the shower area, where\n7In his deposition, Mr. Cantley did say the Incident Report inaccurately stated the time he was\nreleased from the restraint chair and inaccurately stated he broke free from one of the restraints.\n11\n\nthe officer sprayed him with a delousing solution from a Windex type bottle.  He then was permitted\nto shower off and dress in his prison uniform.  After dressing, Mr. Cantley was placed in a holding\ncell with other people until he was assigned to the general housing unit.  Mr. Cantley remained\nincarcerated in the general inmate population until he was released on November 6, 2008.\nUpon consideration of this evidence, the Court finds as a matter of law that the visual\ncavity strip search conducted on Mr. Cantley did not violate his constitutional rights.  As recognized\nin Florence, Defendants have a significant interest in searching detainees to ensure they are not\nbringing any contraband into a facility, even when detainees like Mr. Cantley are held for minor\noffenses.  The search here was conducted post-arraignment by a male correctional officer who never\nphysically touched Mr. Cantley.  The area in which Mr. Cantley disrobed was a private setting where\nno other correctional officers or other detainees could see him.  After the search was complete, Mr.\nCantley was placed in a general housing unit, where he remained for over a month.8  Clearly, Mr.\nCantley’s search falls precisely within the parameters of the constitutionally-permitted conduct\noutlined in Florence.9  Therefore, the Court GRANTS Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment\nwith respect to this claim.  \n8Mr. Cantley stated during his deposition that, after the search, he was placed back in a holding\ncell with other inmates/detainees before he got his assignment to a pod in general housing.\n9Moreover, although not necessary to establish the constitutionality of Mr. Cantley’s search,\nthe Court finds the search was permissible on other grounds.  Mr. Cantley was arrested for violating\na domestic violence protection order and was acting in a violent manner when he was admitted to the\nfacility.  Not only did he attempt to grab a nurse, he threatened to strangle a correctional officer and\nwas so belligerent that he was placed in a restraint chair for an hour and a half before he calmed down. \nCertainly, under these circumstances, officers were justified in searching Mr. Cantley to ensure their\npersonal safety and the safety of others in the facility.\n12\n\nC.\nSearch of Mr. Teter\nTurning next to Mr. Teter’s claim, he was arrested on Friday, February 19, 2010, on\nmisdemeanor charges of Putting Debris in a Roadway and Obstructing an Officer.  At his deposition,\nMr. Teter said he believed he was arrested between 3:00 and 4:00 in the afternoon.  Following his\narrest, Mr. Teter was taken to a local hospital to be examined and then was transported to the Preston\nCounty Courthouse, where he was fingerprinted but did not appear before a judicial officer.  When\nhe was finished at the Courthouse, he was taken to the Tygart Valley Regional Jail in a cruiser with\nan inmate whom he believed was being transferred from a federal facility.  When he got to the\nregional jail, he and the inmate being transferred were patted down by correctional officers and\nbrought to the intake area.  The booking data sheet shows he arrived at the facility at 10:15 p.m. on\nFriday. \nDuring the intake procedures, officers took his personal property, and he discussed his\nmedical situation with a nurse.  According to the booking data sheet, he was medically pre-screened\nat 10:25 p.m.  and screened again at 2:45 a.m. on Saturday.  Afterwards, Mr. Teter said he was taken\nto a shower room and asked to undress.  Mr. Teter testified that there was one male correctional\nofficer in the room with him, whom he identified as Sergeant Daniel Cutright.  According to Mr.\nTeter, Sgt. Cutright searched his clothes and placed them in a bag.  Sgt. Cutright then asked him to\nspread his legs, lift his testicles, turn around, bend over, and spread his cheeks.  He also checked in\nMr. Teter’s mouth.  When he finished with the visual inspection, Sgt. Cutright took a garden type\n13\n\nsprayer and sprayed a delousing solution on him.10  Mr. Teter was instructed to wait for some period\nof time, a matter of minutes, before he could shower.11  After his shower, Mr. Teter dressed in a jail\nuniform and ultimately was taken to a holding cell.  Mr. Teter said that another person was put in the\ncell with him. \nMr. Teter testified he was in the cell for three or four hours before he and the other\ndetainee were placed together in a smaller cell.  He understood that he was being moved into a smaller\ncell because the facility was expecting a van load of detainees who were going to be placed in the\nlarger cell.  Mr. Teter remained in the smaller cell for about one-half hour.  He said he then was taken\nthrough a set of doors and down a hallway past other inmates.   He was placed in a room where he had\na video arraignment and was released on a $500 bond.  According to the Jail Release Order, Mr. Teter\nwas released at 9:00 a.m. on Saturday.\nSgt. Cutright was deposed, and he described that to get to the video conferencing\nroom, detainees have to exit the booking area and go into the core part of the facility, which is about\n100 to 150 yards from the holding cells.  Sgt. Cutright also said the jail had some inmates who had\nbeen sentenced and whose housing assignments were in the booking area, but the pre-arraignment\ndetainees were held in different cells.  Sgt. Cutright said that most detainees who arrived at the facility\nafter 4:00 p.m. were not arraigned until 8:00 a.m. the next day.  When that occurred, detainees, like\n10At oral argument, Defendants clarified that the sprayer was a small, hand-held container, not\nattached to any hose, with a low-pressure spray.\n11At first Mr. Teter said it was a couple of minutes, but later he said it could have been five\nto ten minutes.\n14\n\nMr. Teter, were designated in the TAG system as temporary commitments.12  Sgt. Cutright said that,\nat the time Mr. Teter was brought to the facility, every detainee, whether or not yet arraigned, were\nsubject to being visually strip searched and deloused.\nSgt. Cutright claimed that he was aware of multiple pieces of contraband being\ndiscovered during pat down searches of individuals arriving at the Tygart Valley facility, including\nknives, ammunition, brass knuckles, large pieces of metal, illegal drugs, cigarettes, and lighters.  He\nfurther testified he had found just as much contraband in detainees’ genital areas while doing strip\nsearches as he had by doing pat down searches.  He also said he had found such items taped in armpits\nduring strip searches.  In his Affidavit, Sgt. Cutright averred that the cells where new detainees are\nheld at Tygart Valley hold up to 15 detainees at a time.  He said it was impossible to predict how\nmany people will be placed in a cell on any given occasion because it is dependent upon how many\nindividuals are arrested and brought to the facility.\nDefendants’ Rule 30(b)(6) designee for the Tygart Valley facility is Sergeant Michael\nWayne.  Sgt. Wayne was deposed and confirmed Sgt. Cutright’s statement that the video arraignment\nroom is located in the core area of the facility.  He also agreed with Sgt. Cutright that everyone who\nwas brought to the facility was visually strip searched and deloused.  In January 2011, however, the\nTygart Valley facility was directed to change its practice so that no one charged with a minor crime\ncould be strip searched and deloused until after arraignment unless correctional officers had\n12The designation also is referred to as a CDR because it is made on a document entitled Core\nDisposition Reporting.  Sgt. Cutright noted there are a number of situations where detainees are not\nconsidered temporary commitments, but those other situations are not applicable to Mr. Teter’s case.\n15\n\nreasonable suspicion to search.  Sgt. Wayne stated that the facility was told to change its procedure\nto be in compliance with Policy and Procedure Statement 17001.\nSgt. Wayne said he was troubled by the directive because he believed it downgraded\nsecurity at the facility.  He stated that, as a result of inmate overpopulation, they only can use holding\ncells five and six in the booking area to hold detainees.13  As a result, detainees are segregated only\nby sex, not by whether they are charged with a felony or misdemeanor.  Although the detainees were\nsubjected to pat down searches upon arrival at the facility, he recalled an incident after the directive\nwas issued when marijuana was found inside a holding cell and the detainees were smoking it.  He\nalso recalled a time when a woman concealed eighty Xanax pills on her person and the entire group\nof detainees in the cell were high on Xanax.  He further said that when he has conducted strip searches\nhe has found contraband, including cocaine in the underwear of a person charged with a misdemeanor\noffense of domestic violence.\nPolicy and Procedure Statement 17001, referred to by Sgt. Wayne, sets forth the\nofficial Inmate Admission Procedures promulgated by the WVRJA.  Procedure J of 17001 provides\nthat “[e]ach inmate committed to a regional jail facility will be required to delouse and shower prior\nto being placed in a housing unit.” Policy and Procedure Statement, at 8.  In addition, Policy and\nProcedure 17004, referred to by both parties, states, in part:\n13At the hearing, counsel represented there are six cells in the booking area.  Cells one through\nfour are small cells designed to hold just one or two people.  Cells five and six are large cells.  The\nsmall cells often are used to hold those who are ill, mentally unstable, or under the influence of drugs\nand alcohol.\n16\n\nA newly admitted inmate charged with a misdemeanor\nwill be strip searched only upon reasonable suspicion\nthat the inmate is concealing weapons, contraband or\nevidence.  Reasonable suspicion must be documented\nby  the  Shift  Supervisor.    In  determining  whether\nreasonable suspicion exists, circumstances surrounding\nthe arrest, the crime for which the person is charged,\nand the inmate’s conduct at time of admission shall be\nconsidered.  In any case, no inmate shall be placed in\na housing unit until showered and personal property\ninventoried in accordance with Policy 17001.\nPolicy and Procedure Statement, at 1-2.  These policies have been in effect since May 15, 1997, long\nbefore Mr. Teter was taken into custody.  Although the parties disagree on the meaning and\nimplementation of these policies, they do agree that Tygart Valley’s practice of doing blanket strip\nsearches of all detainees violated the policies to the extent they may prohibit a strip search of a\nmisdemeanant pre-arraignment detainee absent reasonable suspicion to conduct a search.  Regardless\nof whether the strip search of Mr. Teter violated the WVRJA’s own policy, however, the first thing\nthe Court must consider is whether, in light of the facts of his case, the strip search violated Mr.\nTeter’s constitutional rights.14\nAlthough Florence left open the question of whether blanket pre-arraignment strip\nsearches of those charged with minor offenses violate detainees’ constitutional rights, the Court finds\nthe decision instructive in Mr. Teter’s case.  Florence specifically directs courts to begin their analysis\nwith the framework announced in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979). Florence, 132 S. Ct. at 1516. \nIn Bell, the Supreme Court recognized the need for a search must be balanced against an individual\n14Moreover, even when a state policy is not followed, it does not necessarily mean there is a\nconstitutional violation. See Smith v. Atkins, 777 F. Supp. 2d 955, 965 (E.D. N.C. 2011) (stating “the\nmere failure to comply with . . . [a] state regulation and jail policy [regarding suicide watches] is not\na constitutional violation”).\n17\n\ndetainee’s rights. Bell, 441 U.S. at 559.  In applying this balancing test, the Supreme Court upheld the\nconstitutionality of requiring pretrial detainees “to expose their body cavities for visual inspection as\npart of a strip search conducted after every contact visit with a person from outside the institution.”\nId. at 558 (footnote omitted).  The Court made clear that the “[l]oss of freedom of choice and privacy\nare inherent incidents of confinement in such a facility” and correctional officials must have the power\nto discover and deter in a reasonable manner the smuggling of contraband into facilities. Id. at 537\n& 560; see also Florence, 132 S. Ct. at 1517 (reiterating that case law “establish[es] that correctional\nofficials must be permitted to devise reasonable search policies to detect and deter the possession of\ncontraband in their facilities”).  Moreover, the Supreme Court emphasized in Florence that, “in the\nabsence of substantial evidence in the record to indicate that the officials have exaggerated their\nresponse to these considerations courts should ordinarily defer to the expert judgment in such\nmatters.” Florence, 132 S. Ct. at 1517 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\nIn this case, the Tygart Valley facility admittedly was conducting blanket visual strip\nsearches of all detainees, which included Mr. Teter, apparently contrary to Defendants’ policies.  The\nCourt finds the search of Mr. Teter, nevertheless, did not violate his constitutional rights.  The\ndeposition testimony of both Sgt. Cutright and Sgt. Wayne establishes that the facility had a\nreasonable concern about detainees bringing dangerous contraband into the facility.  Although\ndetainees were patted down when they arrived at the facility, Sgt. Cutright stated he found just as\nmuch contraband during strip searches as during pat down searches.  Similarly, Sgt. Wayne\nspecifically recalled an incident, after they stopped doing blanket searches, when detainees were\nfound smoking marijuana in a holding cell and when an individual secreted Xanax pills on her person\nand apparently shared them with the other detainees.  He also recalled a time when he discovered\n18\n\ncocaine during a strip search of an individual charged with a misdemeanor offense of domestic\nviolence.\nThe problem with exempting misdemeanant pre-arraignment detainees from strip\nsearches at the Tygart Valley facility is compounded by the fact that detainees are segregated by sex\nand held together in a communal cell that holds up to fifteen people.  The Tygart Valley facility serves\nas the detention center for at least six counties in West Virginia, and it is impossible for correctional\nofficers to know in advance how many detainees they will hold at any given time or whether those\ndetainees will be charged with misdemeanors or felonies.  When detainees, like Mr. Teter, are brought\nto the facility after the magistrates or judges go off duty, they have to wait until the next morning in\nthe holding cell until their arraignment.  The result is that detainees who are charged with\nmisdemeanors and those charged with felonies end up in the same holding cell.   In addition, for\nvarious reasons, committed inmates are sometimes assigned to the other cells in the booking area as\ntheir general housing assignment.   \nAs recognized by the Supreme Court in Florence, “[e]xempting people arrested for\nminor offenses from a standard search protocol,” when misdemeanants and felons are intermingled,\nincreases the risk of “more contraband being brought into the detention facility” and it “is a\nsubstantial reason not to mandate the exception . . . as a matter of constitutional law.” Id. at 1521.  At\nthe Tygart Valley facility, there is not only the intermingling of misdemeanant and felony detainees,\nbut other committed inmates are sometimes assigned to the booking area.  Detainees also may\nencounter committed inmates when they go to the video conferencing room because it is located in\nthe core of the facility.  In fact, Mr. Teter stated that he saw other inmates when he went to the video\n19\n\nconferencing room for his arraignment.  At the hearing, defense counsel further explained  that the\nvideo conferencing room is used by all inmates, both pretrial detainees and committed inmates.\n \nAlthough the Court views the intrusion on Mr. Teter’s privacy as significant, it is\ntempered somewhat by the fact it was conducted in a private setting, with a same-sex correctional\nofficer who never physically touched him.  No doubt it was an embarrassing and humiliating\nexperience for Mr. Teter, but his interest must be weighed against the strong interest correctional\nofficials have in preventing the introduction of contraband at the facility.  In balancing these interests,\nthe Court finds it weighs in favor of the officials at the Tygart Valley facility, where, as described\nabove, there was a problem with contraband, detainees were held communally in an area that\nsometimes held other committed inmates, and detainees had to walk into the core of the facility to be\narraigned where other committed inmates were present.  Clearly, there is a risk that contraband could\nbe introduced at the Tygart Valley facility because of the manner in which pre-arraignment detainees\nare held.  The Court certainly cannot say there is substantial evidence demonstrating that blanket\nvisual strip searches at the Tygart Valley facility are an exaggerated response to the situation.15\nIn addition, merely because a detainee is currently being held on a misdemeanor does\nnot mean the detainee is not dangerous or has no significant criminal history for other more serious\n15In 1981, the Fourth Circuit decided Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007 (4th Cir. 1981), in which\nit determined that a visual strip search of a detainee being held for driving while intoxicated was\nunconstitutional.  To the extent Logan remains viable under Florence, the Court finds that it clearly\nis distinguishable from the facts presented in this case.  In Logan, the detainee was not intermingled\nwith the general inmate population, she was at the facility for only one and one-half hours and her\nrelease was impending, and she was not subject to a pat down search before being strip searched. 660\nF.2d at 1013.  In addition, the court noted that the search may have been conducted in an area where\nothers could observe her because the window blinds were either open or broken. Id. at 1010.\n20\n\noffenses.  Likewise, misdemeanants may have their own incentive to bring contraband to the facility. \nEven if they do not have such an incentive, if it is known that misdemeanant pre-arraignment\ndetainees are not strip searched, others may coerce them to hold contraband for them. See Florence,\n132 S. Ct. at 1521 (stating “[e]ven if people arrested for a minor offense do not themselves wish to\nintroduce contraband into jail, they may be coerced into doing so by others.  This could happen any\ntime detainees are held in the same area, including in a van on the way to the station or in the holding\ncell of a jail.”).  Accordingly, the Court finds that, under the particular circumstances at the Tygart\nValley facility, the correctional officials implementing the search struck a reasonable balance between\nthe need to provide safety and security at the facility and Mr. Teter’s privacy interests.  Thus, the\nCourt  finds  the  visual  strip  search  at  the  Tygart  Valley  facility  did  not  violate  Mr.  Teter’s\nconstitutional rights and GRANTS summary judgment in favor of Defendants on this claim.16\nD.\nDelousing Procedure\nPlaintiffs also complain that the compulsory delousing procedure at the facilities was\nunconstitutional because it violated the detainee’s right to privacy and it constituted an unwanted\nmedical treatment.  In addition, Plaintiffs claim the process is degrading, ineffective, and unnecessary\nand there are reasonable alternatives to a universal delousing policy.  In balancing the interests of\ndetainees against the interest of facility officials, however, the Court finds the policy strikes a\nreasonable balance and does not violate the detainees’ constitutional rights.\n16Defendants claim they are entitled to summary judgment on several grounds, including\nqualified immunity.  However, the Court need not address those other arguments because the Court\nfinds there was no constitutional violation.\n21\n\nIn Florence, the Supreme Court stated that “[t]he danger of introducing lice or\ncontagious infections . . . is well documented.” 132 S. Ct. at 1518 (citations omitted).  During his\ndeposition, Lt. Aldridge estimated that he saw thirty to thirty-five cases of lice at the Western\nRegional Jail over the past year.  Infection control records for 2010 from the Western Regional Jail\nshow incidents of head lice and scabies nearly every month, but no incidence of pubic lice.  Sgt.\nWayne explained when outbreaks of lice do occur at facilities, it creates a number of problems.  First,\nit requires an extensive process to rid the pests from the facility.  Inmates must be deloused and their\ncells must be stripped and cleaned.  He stated he was aware of another WVRJA facility which had to\ncontinuously use delousing solutions on large sections of inmates.  Second, it creates  potential\nconflicts because those inmates subjected to the process do not think highly of those inmates\nidentified as being infected. \nThe process of delousing at the facilities involves spraying all detainees17 with a\ndelousing solution from a plastic sprayer after they have been visually strip searched.  In Mr.\nCantley’s case it was sprayed from a Windex type bottle, and in Mr. Teter’s case it was a garden\nsprayer.  After the solution is applied, detainees have to keep it on their bodies for about ten minutes\nbefore they are allowed to shower it off.  John L. King II, who is the Chief of Operations for the\nWVRJA, explained that officers do not hand the spray bottle to detainees to spray on themselves\nbecause the bottle may be used as a weapon, they may spray it at the face of the officer, or they may\nnot comply with applying the solution.  In addition, Mr. DeLong, who is the acting Executive Director\n17Mr. King stated pregnant women are not sprayed.\n22\n\nof the WVRJA, stated in his deposition that they do not provide nit combs to detainees because the\ndetainee may use the comb as a weapon.\nThere is no medical screening to determine whether or not a particular detainee has\nlice before they are sprayed.  Mr. King explained the WVRJA contracts with a medical company that\nprovides medical care throughout the facilities, and there may be one or two nurses on duty at a jail\nduring normal business hours.  Mr. King stated it is simply not practical to do visual inspections of\nevery detainee given the volume of detainees coming into some of the facilities and the amount of\nmedical care they must provide other inmates.  Given limited resources, Mr. King said it is an\nadministrative decision to use their personnel and resources in the most cost effective manner they\ncan.  Moreover, he stated that most of the nurses are female, so visual inspections would require a\nfemale nurse to come into the shower area and closely inspect both male and female detainees’ bodies,\nincluding their pubic areas, to see if there are any nits or lice present.  Mr. King believed this process\nwould be much more embarrassing to a detainee then just being sprayed with a solution.   Indeed,\nPlaintiffs’ own proffered expert, Richard J. Pollack, Ph.D., a public-health entomologist, stated in his\nPreliminary Report that the detection of louse eggs and their hatchlings requires specialized training\nand a close inspection or the use of an illuminated magnification device.  He further opined it may\ntake a skilled inspector an hour to examine long, braided or tangled hair on someone’s head. \nToxicologist Anthony F. Pizon, M.D. was named as Defendants’ delousing expert. \nIn his deposition, Dr. Pizon stated that it is more likely to see lice in places like prisons because the\npopulation is held closely together and it easily spreads.  Dr. Pizon said Liceall, the delousing solution\nused by the WVRJA, is a pyrehtrin, which is a safe over-the-counter natural product derived from a\n23\n\nchrysanthemum plant.  Although Dr. Pizon said he recommends two applications of the solution about\nseven days apart because of the life cycle of lice and their eggs, he estimated that one application will\neradicate lice on about fifty to seventy-five percent of people who have it.  With two treatments, he\nsaid it would eliminate lice on about ninety percent of the people who have it.  Dr. Pollack also opined\nthat a single application would not kill embryotic lice.  \nDr. Pizon opined that proactively delousing detainees in a correctional facility is\nappropriate because there is a greater risk of lice in a prison population, delousing treats everyone the\nsame, and Liceall is a safe product.   He also approves of the manner in which the WVRJA has\ncorrectional officers apply the solution because they can ensure it is thoroughly applied to the hairy\nareas of the body and officers can avoid getting the solution on sores or in eyes, which may cause\nirritation.  He  further mentioned that detainees may attempt to drink the solution if correctional\nofficers hand it to them to apply themselves.\nPlaintiffs argue that, because there is only one application and detainees are not\nprovided a nit comb to remove eggs, the treatment is completely ineffective.  Plaintiffs insist that a\nbetter procedure would be to ask the detainees whether they have lice or to have them screened by a\nnurse or assessed by a correctional officer.  In addition, Plaintiffs contend there is no legitimate\njustification for delousing detainees’ entire bodies because none of the deponents could identify a\nsingle outbreak of body lice in the regional jail system.  Despite these arguments, the Court finds the\npolicy strikes a reasonable balance between the legitimate interests of the WVRJA and the detainee.\n24\n\nIn assessing Plaintiffs’ arguments, the Court is guided by Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S.\n78 (1987).  In Turner, the Supreme Court recognized that “[r]unning a prison is an inordinately\ndifficult undertaking that requires expertise, planning, and the commitment of resources, all of which\nare peculiarly within the province of the legislative and executive branches of government.”  482 U.S.\nat 84-85.  In addition, the Supreme Court cautioned that “[w]here a state penal system is involved\nfederal courts have . . . additional reason to accord deference to the appropriate prison authorities.”\nId. at 85 (citation omitted).  “[W]hen a prison regulation impinges on inmates’ constitutional rights,\nthe regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.” Id. at 89.  In\nassessing the reasonableness of a regulation, courts should consider: (1) whether there is a “‘valid,\nrational connection’ between the prison regulation and the legitimate governmental interest put\nforward to justify it[;]” (2) whether there are alternative means of exercising the right that remain open\nto prison inmates[;]” (3) what “impact accommodation of the asserted constitutional right will have\non guards and other inmates and on the allocation of prison resources generally[;]” and (4) “the\nabsence of ready alternatives is evidence of the reasonableness of a prison regulation.” Id. at 89-90\n(citations omitted).\nIn applying these considerations to the present case, the Court finds there is a valid and\nrational relationship between the delousing policy and the correctional authorities’ interest in reducing\nthe outbreak of lice in the jails.  As stated above, lice infestation is a real problem in correctional\nfacilities.  Inmates live in close quarters and outbreaks can be hard and expensive to eradicate.  The\ndelousing policy is designed to reduce the number of outbreaks in the facility by eliminating anywhere\nfrom fifty to seventy-five percent of the cases from the outset.  Although the process does not kill\nembryotic lice and some outbreaks still occur in the facility, perfection is not a constitutional\n25\n\nrequirement.  It certainly is laudable to eradicate a significant percentage of the lice before they\nspread, and the policy is logically connected to this objective.  Moreover, although there is no\nevidence of outbreaks of pubic lice in a facility, it is unknown if there would be outbreaks if the policy\nwas not in place.  Given the strong interest correctional officials have in maintaining a lice-free\nenvironment, the Court finds that the policy is not unreasonable.\nNext, the Court recognizes that the correctional officials should be given deference as\nto what is the most effective and efficient manner in which to maintain a lice-free environment. \nPlaintiffs suggest correctional officers simply should ask an inmate whether they have lice and then\ndelouse as needed.  However, as noted by Mr. King, correctional officers cannot trust that detainees\nwill give an honest answer because it may be a situation in which they do not know they have lice or\nthey may have a reason to lie about it.  In addition, the Court rejects Plaintiffs’ suggestion that the\ndelousing policy should be replaced by physically screening all inmates.  Such a process would be\nextremely time consuming, expensive, and intrusive as it would require either an up-close or\nilluminated magnification of a detainee’s body.  In addition, if the screening is performed by a nurse,\nit will have a significant impact on the other inmates in need of medical care because those nurses\nwould be unavailable to deliver that care unless correctional officials would allocate more prison\nresources for additional nurses.  Under these circumstances, the Court will leave to the sound\ndiscretion of the WVRJA how best to allocate its resources and reduce the incidence of lice in the jails\nin a cost effective and efficient way.\nIn addition, the Court finds the policy is not unconstitutional because the detainees are\nsprayed by a correctional officer rather than given a cup of the solution to apply it to themselves, as\n26\n\nPlaintiffs assert were the underlying facts in Florence.  First, the Court recognizes that the detainees\nalready have been visually strip searched so the fact they remain in view of the correctional officer\nfor a very limited time longer in order to be deloused is not a significant additional impingement on\ntheir right to privacy.  Second, the correctional officers have offered legitimate reasons for not\nallowing detainees to apply the solution to themselves because they may not comply, may use it as\na weapon, or may apply it improperly or incompletely.  Third, the correctional officers never touch\nthe detainees with their hands; they merely spray the solution on them.  Plaintiffs attempt to compare\nthis spraying with the unconstitutional touching in Amaechi v. West, 237 F.3d 356 (4th Cir. 2001),\nbut that case is far removed from the facts of this case. See Amaechi, 237 F.3d at 359-60 (finding a\nconstitutional violation where a semi-clad woman, who was being arrested for a noise violation that\noccurred two days earlier, was subjected to an officer swiping his ungloved hand across the vagina\nin front of her townhouse where others could observe).  Thus, the Court finds no reason to declare the\npolicy unconstitutional based upon the manner in which it is applied.  Therefore, the Court finds that\nthe delousing policy at issue in this case is reasonably related to the WVRJA’s goal of decreasing the\nspread of lice and it is entitled to deference.  The Court finds neither Mr. Cantley nor Mr. Teter’s\nconstitutional rights were violated by virtue of being deloused.\nIV.\nCONCLUSION\nAccordingly, after review of the undisputed evidence submitted in this case and for\nthe foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS summary judgment in favor of Defendants on Plaintiffs’\nclaims and DENIES summary judgment in favor of Plaintiffs.  In addition, as Defendants have been\nawarded summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ individual claims and a class has not been certified, the\nCourt finds Plaintiffs may not proceed with this action. See J & R Mktg., SEP v. Gen. Motors Corp.,\n27\n\n549 F.3d 384, 390 (6th Cir. 2008) (“If it is found, prior to class certification, that the named plaintiffs’\nindividual claims are without merit, then dismissal is proper.”); Bass v. Butler, 116 F. App’x 376, 385\n(3d Cir. 2004) (dismissing class claim where individual claims were dismissed pre-certification). \nThus, as there are no other matters pending before the Court, the Court DISMISSES this case from\nthe docket of the Court.\nThe Court DIRECTS the Clerk to send a copy of this Order to counsel of record and\nany unrepresented parties.\nENTER: October 4, 2013\n28",

Chambers \n   \nv.   \n  FIRST AMENDED \nThe West Virginia Regional Jail and  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \nCorrectional Facility Authority;    \n   \nand;   \n   \nTerry L. Miller, both individually and in his   \nofficial capacity as Executive Director of the  JURY TRIAL DEMANDED \nWest Virginia Regional Jail and Correctional   \nFacility Authority. \n \n    Defendants. \n \n \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis is a class action brought to redress th e deprivation by Defendants of rights secured \nto the Plaintiff and proposed Class by the United  States Constitution and the laws of the United \nStates  of Am erica.   For at least the past   11  years, the W est  Virginia Regional Jail and \nCorrectional Facility Authority has had a policy of strip  searching all individuals who enter any \nof the West Virginia Regional Jails and placing them  in jail clothing, regardless of the crim e \nwith which they are charged.  In addition, the W est Virginia Regional Jail and Correctional \nFacility Authority also requires that all pre-trial detainees be deloused by having corrections \n  1\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 14    Filed 10/09/09   Page 2 of 20\nofficers use plastic bottles to spray caustic delousing solution over the genitals of detainees. The \nDefendants have admitted the truth of these factual allegations.    These procedures are, in part, \nderived from the written policies of  the West Virginia Regional Jail and Correctional Facility \nAuthority, and were promulgated by senior West Virginia Regional Jail and Correctional Facility \nAuthority officials named herein. \nIt is well established in this judicial circ uit that individuals charged with m isdemeanors \nor other minor crimes cannot be strip-searched absent particularized suspicion that they possess \nweapons  or contraband.  Consequently, the po licy  of the W est  Virginia Regional Jail and \nCorrectional  Facility Authority to force thos e  charged with m inor  crimes  to undergo the \nindignities of a strip search upon entry into the  any of the W est Virginia Regional Jails is \ninsensitive, unnecessary, and illegal.   \nPlaintiff Cantley brings this action on behalf  of himself, and on behalf of a Class of \nthousands of others who were strip searched af ter being charged with petty crimes, to vindicate \nthe clear and unnecessary violation of his civ il rights and those of the Class Mem bers he \nproposes to represent.  Plaintiff was charged w ith a non-felony offense, and was subjected to a \nstrip search, in violation of his right against unreasonable searches under the Fourth Amendment \nof the United States Constitution.  Plaintiff  seeks monetary damages from Defendant Terry L. \nMiller for himself and each member of the Proposed Class, a declaration that Defendant W est \nVirginia Regional Jail and Correctional Facility Authority’s policies are unconstitutional, and an \ninjunction precluding Defendant West Virginia Regional Jail and Correctional Facility Authority \nand Defendant Terry L. Miller f rom continuing to violate the rights of  those placed into the \n  2\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 14    Filed 10/09/09   Page 3 of 20\ncustody of the Regional Jails that they adm inister.  With this as a background, Plaintiff Cantley \ncomplains as follows: \nJURISDICTION \n1.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. §§ \n1331, 1341 & 1343 because it is filed to obtain com pensatory damages and injunctive relief for \nthe deprivation, under color of state law, of the rights of citizens of the United States secured by \nthe Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42 U. S.C. § 1983.  This Court also has jurisdiction \nover this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. § 2201, as it is filed to obtain declaratory relief \nrelative to the constitutionality of the policies of a state government. \n2.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2 ) because a substantial part of the \nevents or omissions giving rise  to Plaintiff’s and Class claim s occurred within this judicial \ndistrict. \nPARTIES \n3.  Plaintiff Cantley is an adult male residing in Cabell County, West Virginia.  On or \nabout September 28, 2008, he was arrested and  placed in the Western Regional Jail on on non-\nfelony charges of violating an order of protecti on at the home of his ex-wife.  Mr. Cantley was \nalso admitted to custody of the W estern Regional Jail on several other occasions during the \nproposed class period.   \n4.  Defendant  West  Virginia Regional Ja il  and Correctional Facility Authority \n(“WVRJA”) is a state government agency organized and existing under the laws of the State of \nWest Virginia.  At all tim es relevant hereto, the WVRJA was responsible for the policies, \npractices, supervision, implementation and conduct of all matters pertaining to the West Virginia \n  3\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 14    Filed 10/09/09   Page 4 of 20\nRegional Jail System and was responsible for the appointment, training, supervision and conduct \nof all Regional Jail personnel, including those wo rking in the Central Regional Jail, Eastern \nRegional Jail, North Central Regional Jail, Northern Regional Jail, Potomac Highlands Regional \nJail, South Central Regional Jail, Southern Regi onal Jail, Southwestern Regional Jail, Tygart \nValley Regional Jail, and the W estern Regional Jail (collectively the “West Virginia Regional \nJail System” or “WVRJS”).  In addition, at all  relevant times, the WVRJA was responsible for \nenforcing the rules of the W est Virginia Regional Jail System, and for ensuring that personnel \nemployed in West Virginia Regional Jail system  obey the Constitution and laws of  the United \nStates and of the State of West Virginia.   \n5.  Defendant Terry L. Miller (“Director Miller”) is the duly appointed Executive \nDirector of the WVRJA, and, as such, is a policy maker with respect to the treatment of pre-trial \nand other detainees over which the W VRJA exercises custodial or other control.  Director \nMiller’s principal place of business is the W VRJA’s Office, 1325 Virginia St. East, Charleston \nWest Virginia, 25301.  Director Miller is m ade a Defendant in this action in both his individual \nand official capacities.   \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n6.  Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Rules 23(b)(1), 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) of the \nFederal  Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of   himself  and a Class of sim ilarly  situated \nindividuals who were charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and were strip searched upon \ntheir entry into the W est Virginia Regional  Jail System, including the Central Regional Jail, \nEastern Regional Jail, North Central Regional Ja il, Northern Regional Jail, Potomac Highlands \n  4\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 14    Filed 10/09/09   Page 5 of 20\nRegional Jail, South Central Regional Jail, Southe rn Regional Jail, Southwestern Regional Jail, \nTygart Valley Regional Jail, and the Western Regional Jail. \n7.  The Class that Plaintiff seeks to represent is defined as follows: \nAll persons who have been or will be  placed into the custody of the W est \nVirginia  Regional Jail System ,  after being charged with m isdemeanors, \nsummary  violations, violations of  probation,  traffic infractions, civil \ncommitments or other minor crimes and were or will be strip searched and \ndeloused upon their entry into the W est Virginia Regional Jail System , \npursuant to the policy, custom  and practice of the West Virginia Regional \nJail and Correctional Facility Author ity.  The class period com mences on \nJune 30, 2007 and extends to the date on which the West Virginia Regional \nJail  and Correctional Facility Authority   is enjoined f rom,  or otherwise \nceases,  enforcing its policy, practi ce  and custom   of conducting strip \nsearches absent reasonable suspicion.  Specifically excluded from the class \nare  Defendants  and any and all of   their respective af filiates,  legal \nrepresentatives, heirs, successors, employees or assignees.   \n \n8.  This action has been brought and m ay properly be maintained as a Class action \nunder  Federal law and satisfies the num erosity,  commonality,  typicality and adequacy \nrequirements for maintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n9.  The members of the Class are so num erous as to render joinder im practicable.  \nUpon  information  and belief, there are hundred s  of people arrested for m isdemeanors  and \nviolations who are placed into the custody of  the West Virginia Regional Jail System  every \nmonth -- all of whom are members of the Proposed Class.  Upon information and belief, the size \nof the Proposed Class totals at least thousands of individuals, some of whom have had their civil \nrights violated on multiple occasions. \n10.  Upon information and belief, joinder of a ll of these individuals is im practicable \nbecause of the large num ber of Class Mem bers and the fact that Class Mem bers are likely \ndispersed over a large geographical area, with some members presently residing outside of West \n  5\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 14    Filed 10/09/09   Page 6 of 20\nVirginia and this Judicial District.  Furthermore, upon information and belief, many members of \nthe Class are low-income persons, may not speak English, and likely would have great difficulty \nin pursuing their rights individually. \n11.  Common questions of law and fact exist as  to all members of the Class, in that \nthey all had their right to be free from unreasonable searches and involuntary delousing violated \nby Defendants’ conducting strip searches absent pa rticularized suspicion.  All m embers of the \nClass were charged with misdemeanors or summary violations when placed into the custody of \nthe West Virginia Regional Jail System, and all were illegally strip searched in violation of  the \nestablished law in this judicial circuit. \n12.  Plaintiff’s claims are typical of the claims of the members of the Class.  Plaintiff \nand all members of the Class sustained dam ages arising out of Defendants’ course of conduct.   \nThe harms suffered by the Plaintiff are typical of the harms suffered by the Class Members. \n13.  The representative Plaintiff has the requisite personal interest in the outcom e of \nthis action and will f airly and adequately protect  the interests of  the Class.  Plaintif f has no \ninterests that are adverse to the interests of the Members of the Class. \n14.  Plaintiff has retained counsel with subs tantial experience in the prosecution of \nClass action and civil rights litigation, including su ccessful litigation of strip search cases.   \nPlaintiff’s counsel has the resources, expertise  and experience to successfully prosecute this \naction against the WVRJA and Director Miller.  Counsel for the Plaintiff knows of no conflicts \namong members of the Class or between counsel and members of the Class. \n15.  This action, in part, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.  As such, the Plaintiff \nseeks Class Certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b )(2), in that all Class Members were subject \n  6\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 14    Filed 10/09/09   Page 7 of 20\nto the same policy requiring the illegal strip search es and delousing of individuals charged with \nmisdemeanor or minor crimes and placed into the custody of the W est Virginia Regional Jail \nSystem.  In short, the WVRJA, Director Miller, and the Regional Jail personnel acted on grounds \ngenerally applicable to all Class Members. \n16.  In addition to certification under Rule 23(b)(2 ), and in the alternative, Plaintiffs \nseek certification under Rule 23(b)(3).   \n17.  Common questions of law and fact exist  as to all m embers of the Class, and \npredominate  over any questions that affect onl y  individual m embers  of the Class.  These \ncommon questions of law and fact include,  without limitation, the common and predominate \nquestion  of  whether the Def endants’  written and/or  de  facto  policy  of strip searching and \ndelousing all individuals charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and committed to the Jail \nis a violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth  Amendments to the United States Constitution, and \nwhether such a written and/or de facto policy existed during the Class Period. \n18.  A Class action is superior to other ava ilable methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy, since joinder of  all of the individual m embers of the Class is \nimpracticable given the large number of Class Members and the fact that they are dispersed over \na large geographical area.  Furtherm ore, the expense and burden of individual litigation would \nmake it difficult or impossible for individual members of the Class to redress the wrongs done to \nthem.  The cost to the federal court system  of adjudicating thousands of individual cases would \nbe enormous.  Individualized litigation would also  magnify the delay and expense to all parties \nand the court system.  By contrast, the conduct of this action as a Class action in this District \n  7\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 14    Filed 10/09/09   Page 8 of 20\npresents far fewer management difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court \nsystem, and protects the rights of each member of the Class. \n19.  Upon information and belief, there are  no other actions pending to address the \nDefendants’ flagrant violation of the civil ri ghts of thousands of individuals, even though the \nDefendants have maintained their illegal strip search and delousing regimen for at least the past \ntwelve years. \n20.  In the alternative to certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), Plaintiff also \nseeks partial certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4). \nFACTS \nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally \n21.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits state officials, \nsuch  as Director Miller in this action and the Corrections Of ficers  he supervises, f rom \nperforming strip searches of arrestees who have been charged with misdemeanors or other minor \ncrimes unless the officer has reasonable suspici on to believe that the arrestee is concealing a \nweapon or contraband. \n22.  The WVRJA and Director Miller have instituted a written and/or  de facto policy, \ncustom or practice of strip searching and delous ing all individuals who enter the custody of the \nWest Virginia Regional Jail System, regardless of the nature of their charged crime and without \nthe presence of reasonable suspicion to believe  that the individual was concealing a weapon or \ncontraband. \n23.  In a recent filing with the Court, th e WVRJA and Director Miller adm itted, \nthrough counsel, as follows:  “W VRJA maintains a policy by which all incom ing detainees go \n  8\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 14    Filed 10/09/09   Page 9 of 20\nthrough a visual strip search a nd delousing procedure ….Defendants acknowledge that Plaintiff \nwas  strip searched and deloused upon his ad mission  to Western  Regional Jail pursuant to \nWVRJA.”  (Docket Number 8, pp. 1, 4).     \n24.  The written policy of the W VRJA also confirms this procedure.  A copy of the \nWVRJA’s  written “Inm ate  Admission  Procedures”  policy is attached to this Am ended \nComplaint as Exhibit A.    \n25.  The WVRJA and Director Miller have instituted a written and/or  de facto policy, \ncustom or practice of conducting visual body cavity  searches (visual inspection of the vaginal \nand rectal cavities) on all individuals who enter  the custody of the West Virginia Regional Jail \nSystem, regardless of the individual characteristics  or the nature of their charged crim e.  For \npurposes of this Complaint, strip and visual cavity searches are collectively referred to as “strip \nsearches”.  These strip and visual cavity search es include a visual inspection of a detainee’s \ngenitals and anus, and require detainees to m anipulate body parts to allow for an inspection of \nthese private areas.   \n26.  Upon information and belief, some members of the Proposed Class (not including \nthe Plaintiff) are also required to undergo physical cavity searches upon entry to the custody of \nthe WVRJA, where a Corrections Officer inserts a gloved finger into the rectum of a detainee to \nsearch for contraband.   \n27.  The WVRJA and Director Miller have instituted a written and/or  de facto policy, \ncustom or practice of delousing all individuals  who enter the custody of the W est Virginia \nRegional Jail System, regardless of the individual  characteristics or the nature of their charged \ncrime.  The delousing procedure first entails  a detainee completely disrobing in front of a \n  9\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 14    Filed 10/09/09   Page 10 of 20\ncorrection officer.  The correction officer then sprays delousing solution upon a detainee’s naked \nbody.  Finally, the detainee is ordered to shower w ithin full view of the corrections officer.  The \ndelousing procedure is conducted upon all detainees  without inquiry into or establishm ent of \nreasonable suspicion, or inquiry or establishment into whether the detainee actually harbors lice.  \nThis delousing is com pulsory, in that a correc tion officer stands before a detainee and sprays \nthem with a plastic spray bottle, and then observes them  rubbing the solution into their hair, \nincluding their pubic hair.  This delousing occurs  in the absence of any m edical evaluation to \ndetermine the presence, or absence, of lice.  \n28.  Upon information and belief, the presence of lice in the W VRJA facilities is \nlimited,  and the one-tim e  application of   “liceall,”  in the absence of any further m edical \ntreatment, is not an effective cure for lice.   \n29.  Upon information and belief, the “liceall” solution used by the WVRJA is caustic, \nin that can, and often does, cause chem ical burns to those upon whom  it is applied, especially \nAfrican-Americans.   \n30.  Upon information and belief, Corrections Officers of the WVRJA do not receive \nany medical training prior to applying “liceall” to  the faces, genitals, and rectum s of pre-trial \ndetainees.   \n31.  The strip searches and delousing discussed in this com plaint are often im posed \nupon pre-trial detainees prior to their arraignm ent before a judge.  Upon information and belief, \nmany members of the proposed class are bailed out of custody shortly after being arraigned.    \n  10\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 14    Filed 10/09/09   Page 11 of 20\n32.  The WVRJA and Director Miller know that  they may not institute, enforce or \npermit enforcement of a policy or practice of conducting strip searches and delousing without \nparticularized, reasonable suspicion.   \n33.  The Defendants’ written and/or de facto policy, practice and custom mandating \nwholesale strip searches and delousing of all  misdemeanor and violation arrestees has been \npromulgated, effectuated and/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly established law. \n34.  Reasonable  suspicion to conduct a stri p  search m ay  only em anate  from  the \nparticular circumstances antecedent to the searc h, such as the nature of the crim e charged, the \nparticular characteristics of the arrestees, and/or the circumstances of the arrest. \n35.  The  WVRJA  and Director Miller have  promulgated,  implemented,  enforced, \nand/or failed to rectify a written and/or de facto policy, practice or custom of strip searching and \ndelousing all individuals placed into the custody of  the West Virginia Regional Jail System  \nwithout any requirement of reasonable suspicion, or indeed suspicion of any sort.  This written \nand/or de facto policy made the strip searching of pre-trial detainees routine; neither the nature \nof the offense charged, the characteristics of the  arrestee, nor the circumstances of a particular \narrest were relevant to the enforcem ent of the policy, practice and custom  of routine strip \nsearches.   \n36.  Pursuant  to this written and/or  de  facto  policy,  each m ember  of the Class, \nincluding the named Plaintiff, was the victim of a routine strip search upon their entry into the \nWest Virginia Regional Jail System .  These s earches and delousing were conducted without \ninquiry  into or establishm ent  of reasonable  suspicion,  and in fact were not supported by \n  11\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 14    Filed 10/09/09   Page 12 of 20\nreasonable suspicion.  Strip searches are conduc ted for individuals arrested for, am ong other \ninnocuous offenses, Driving While Intoxicated, Harassment and Trespassing. \n37.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search conducted pursuant \nto this written and/or de facto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip searches and delousing -- \neach  member  of the class, including the na med  Plaintiff -- has suffered or will suffer \npsychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \n \nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiff \n38.  Plaintiff Cantley is an adult male residing in Cabell County, West Virginia.  On or \nabout September 28, 2008 he was arrested on non- felony charges of violating an order of \nprotection at the home of his ex-wife.  Specifically, Mr. Cantley was required to stay away from  \nhis former wife’s home, and failed to do so on the date in question.  The allegations against Mr. \nCantley did not involve a claim  that he had harmed his wife, or anyone else, but rather that he \nwas present in a location at which he was forbidden to be present.    Plaintiff Cantley’s arrest was \nvoid of any reasonable suspicion that he harbored any weapons or contraband. \n39.  Mr. Cantley was first taken in custody by the West Virginia State Police, and later \nthat evening taken to the Western Regional Jail.  The Plaintiff was initially housed in a holding \ncell.  \n40.  After being housed in a holding cell for se veral hours, the Plaintiff was required \nto undergo a strip search. \n41.  Plaintiff was brought into a shower room  and advised by a correctional officer \nthat he would be strip searche d.  In connection with the strip search, Plaintiff was required to \n  12\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 14    Filed 10/09/09   Page 13 of 20\ncompletely disrobe, lift his arm s and legs, spread his butt cheeks, lift up his testicles and bend \nover, so that he could be inspected by a correcti onal officer.  Plaintiff was then sprayed with de-\nlousing solution and ordered to shower while th e corrections officer had a com plete view of \nPlaintiff showering.  He was then issued prison clothing. \n42.  Plaintiff was released from the Western Regional Jail on or about Novem ber 6, \n2008, and all charges were dismissed.   \n43.  Mr. Cantley has also been adm itted the Western Regional Jail on several other \noccasions during the class period for m isdemeanor or other m inor charges, and underwent \nprocedures  similar,  in all m aterial  ways, to   those detailed in this Am ended  Class Action \nComplaint.   Upon inform ation  and belief, thes e  arrests were also void of any reasonable \nsuspicion to believe that he possessed weapons or contraband in his private areas.  \n44.  As a direct and proxim ate result of thes e unlawful strip searches, Plaintiff has \nsuffered and continues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \n \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST DIRECTOR MILLER IN  \nHIS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY \n \n-- Violation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law --  \n-- Illegal Strip and Visual Cavity Searches -- \n \n45.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference and r ealleges each and every allegation stated \nin the foregoing paragraphs. \n46.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects citizens f rom \nunreasonable searches by law enforcement officers, and prohibits officers from conducting strip \n  13\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 14    Filed 10/09/09   Page 14 of 20\nsearches and delousing of individuals arrested  for misdemeanors or violations absent som e \nparticularized suspicion that the individual in question has either contraband or weapons. \n47.  The actions of Director Miller detailed a bove violated Plaintiff’s rights under the \nUnited States Constitution.  It was not objectivel y reasonable for West Virginia Regional Jail \npersonnel to strip search and delouse the Plain tiff and Class Members based on their arrests for \nmisdemeanor/ summary violation charges.  It wa s also not objectively reasonable for Director \nMiller to order/direct West Virginia Regional Jail System personnel to conduct such searches.   \n48.  These strip searches and delousing were conducted pursuant to the policy, custom \nor practice of Director Miller.   As such, Director Miller is directly liable f or the damages of \nPlaintiff and members of the Class. \n49.  Upon information and belief, Director M iller is responsible for establishing the \npolicies and procedures to be utilized in the operation of  the Western Regional Jail system, and \nis responsible for the implementation of the strip search and delousing policies questioned in this \nlawsuit.  As such, Director Miller is individually responsible for the damages of the Plaintiff and \nMembers of the Class.    \n50.  The Policy Making Defendants knew that th e Jail’s strip search and delousing \npolicies were illegal, and acted willfully, knowingly, and with specific intent to deprive Plaintiff \nand Members of the Class of their Constitutional rights. \n51.  This conduct on the part of all Defendants  represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. § \n1983, given that their actions were taken under color of state law. \n52.  As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above,  \nPlaintiff and the Members of the Class have been irreparably injured. \n  14\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 14    Filed 10/09/09   Page 15 of 20\n \n \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST DIRECTOR MILLER IN  \nHIS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY \n \n-- Violation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law --  \n-- The Right to Privacy – \n \n53.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference and r ealleges each and every allegation stated \nin the foregoing paragraphs. \n54.  The  right to privacy is protected by th e  Fourth Am endment  and is also an \nindependent right with other constitutional underpinnings. \n55.  The right to privacy prohibits officers  from conducting delousing of individuals \narrested for misdemeanors or violations absent some particularized suspicion that the individual \nin question has lice. \n56.  The actions of Director Miller detailed  above violated and im properly invaded \nPlaintiff’s right to privacy.  It was not objec tively reasonable for West Virginia Regional Jail \npersonnel  to delouse the Plaintiff and Cl ass  Members  based on their arrests for \nmisdemeanor/summary violation charges.  It wa s also not objectively reasonable for Director \nMiller to order/direct West Virginia Regional Jail System personnel to conduct such a procedure.   \n57.  This  delousing was conducted pursuant to the policy, custom   or practice of \nDirector Miller.  As such, Director Miller is directly liable f or the damages of Plaintiff and \nmembers of the Class. \n58.  Upon information and belief, Director M iller is responsible for establishing the \npolicies and procedures to be utilized in the operation of  the Western Regional Jail, and is \n  15\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 14    Filed 10/09/09   Page 16 of 20\nresponsible for the implementation of the delousing policies questioned in this lawsuit.  As such, \nDirector Miller is individually responsible for th e damages of the Plaintiff and Mem bers of the \nClass.    \n59.  The Policy Making Defendant knew that the Jail’s delousing policies were illegal, \nand acted willfully, knowingly, and with specific in tent to deprive Plaintiff and Members of the \nClass of their Constitutional rights. \n60.  This conduct on the part of all Defendants  represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. § \n1983, given that their actions were taken under color of state law. \n61.  As a direct and proxim ate result of  the unconstitutional acts described above, \nPlaintiff and the members of the Class have been irreparably injured. \n \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \n \n-- Demand for Declaratory Judgment -- \n   \n62.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference and r ealleges each and every allegation stated \nin the foregoing paragraphs. \n63.  The policy, custom and practice of  the WVRJA and Director Miller is clearly \nunconstitutional and violates the right to privac y, in that these entities and individuals are \ndirecting/conducting the strip searches and delous ing of all individuals placed into the W est \nVirginia  Regional Jail System   without any particularized suspicion that the individuals in \nquestion have either contraband or weapons. \n  16\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 14    Filed 10/09/09   Page 17 of 20\n64.  Plaintiff and Members of the Class request  that this Court issue a declaratory \njudgment, and that it declare the strip search and delousing policies of the WVRJA and Director \nMiller to be unconstitutional and violative of the right to privacy. \n \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS  \n-- Demand for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction -- \n65.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference and r ealleges each and every allegation stated \nin the foregoing paragraphs. \n66.  The policy, custom and practice of  the WVRJA and Director Miller is clearly \nunconstitutional and violative of the right to priv acy, in that these entities and individuals are \ndirecting/conducting the strip searches and delous ing of all individuals placed into the W est \nVirginia  Regional Jail system   without any particularized suspicion that the individuals in \nquestion have either contraband, weapons, or lice. \n67.  Upon information and belief, this policy is currently in place in the West Virginia \nRegional Jail System, with new and/or prospective Members of the Class being subjected to the \nharms that have already been inflicted upon the Plaintiff.   \n68.  The continuing pattern of strip searching  and delousing individuals charged with \nminor crimes will cause irreparable harm to the new and/or prospective Members of the Class, \nan adequate remedy for which does not exist at law. \n69.  Plaintiff  demands  that the W VRJA,  Director Miller, and the W est  Virginia \nRegional  Jail System   personnel im mediately  desist  from  strip searching and delousing \nindividuals  placed into the custody of the W est  Virginia Regional Jail System   absent any \n  17\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 14    Filed 10/09/09   Page 18 of 20\nparticularized suspicion that the individuals in question have either contraband, weapons, or lice, \nand seeks both a preliminary and permanent injunction from this Court ordering as much. \n \nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY \n70.  The Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury. \n \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff Cantley, on behalf of himself and on behalf of a Class of others \nsimilarly situated, requests that this Honorable Court grant them the following relief: \n \n1.

CIVIL  ACTION  NO.  3:09-0758\nTHE WEST VIRGINIA REGIONAL JAIL and\nCORRECTIONAL FACILITY AUTHORITY; and\nTERRY L. MILLER, both individually and in his\nofficial capacity as Executive Director of the\nWest Virginia Regional Jail and Correctional\nFacility Authority,\nDefendants.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\nPending before the Court is a Motion to Dismiss by Defendants The West Virginia\nRegional Jail and Correctional Facility Authority (WVRJA) and Terry L. Miller. [Doc. No. 16].\nUpon consideration of the arguments by the parties, the Court DENIES Defendants’ motion.\nI.\nFACTS\nOn October 9, 2009, Plaintiff Michael Cantley, individually and on behalf of a Class\nof others similarly situated, filed his First Amended Complaint.  In his First Amended Class Action\nComplaint, Plaintiff asserts he was arrested on or about September 28, 2008, on non-felony charges\nof violating a domestic violence protection order.  Plaintiff states he was at his former wife’s house\nin violation of the order, but he did not harm her or anyone else while there.  Following his arrest,\nPlaintiff was taken into custody and placed in a holding cell at the Western Regional Jail, where\nPlaintiff states he has been in custody on severa l previous occasions.  Ac cording to Plaintiff,\n\nDefendant WVRJA is responsible for the policies, practices, supervision, im plementation, and\nconduct of all matters pertaining to the West Virginia Regional Jail System, which includes the\nWestern Regional Jail.  Defendant Miller is t he duly appointed Executive Director and a policy\nmaker for the WVRJA.\nAfter several hours of custody, Plaintiff wasr equired to undergo a visual cavity strip\nsearch (vcs)1 and delousing pursuant to a WVRJA policy.  Although Plaintiff claims his arrest was\nvoid of any reasonable suspicion he possessed any weapons or contraband, the policy required him\nto completely disrobe in front of a correctional officer of the same sex for a visual inspection.\nDuring the inspection, Plaintiff had to lift his ar ms and legs, spread his butt cheeks, lift up his\ntesticles and bend at the waist.  The correctional officer then sprayed a delousing solution on him\nand required him to shower in view of the officer.  Plaintiff claims that correctional officers receive\nno medical training in applying the delousing solution and the delousing policy is enforced without\n1“A ‘strip search,’ though an umbrella term, generally refers to an inspection of a naked\nindividual, without any scrutiny of the subjecst' body cavities.  A ‘visual body cavity search’ extends\nto visual inspection of the anal and genital areas.  A ‘manual body cavity search’ includes some\ndegree of touching or probing of body cavities.”B lackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556, 561 n. 3 (1st Cir.\n1985) (citation omitted).  Although Plaintiff states he was not subjected to a physical cavity search,\nhe makes a cursory statement that he believes some members of the proposed class may have been\nsubject to such a search.  Defendants deny they do physical cavity searches.  In any event, Plaintiff\ndoes not focus on this type of search in his briefing before the Court, and it does not appear that he\nrelies upon this type of search in any of his causes of action.  In the  First Amended Complaint,\nPlaintiff states he refers collectively to strip and vcs searches as “strip searches,” and these require\na detainee to manipulate body parts for a visual inspection of the detainee’s genitals and anus.  A\nphysical cavity search is not included in this descrpition.  He then proceeds to discuss only strip and\nvcs searches in his causes of action, with no specific mention of physical cavity searches.  Thus, this\nCourt will not discuss the impact physical cavity searches may have on the constitutional issues\nraised in this case.\n-2-\n\nany medical evaluation to determine if lice are present.  Based upon information and belief, Plaintiff\nfurther asserts that the WVJRA uses “Liceall,” which Plaintiff alleges is a caustic solution that can,\nand often does, cause chemical burns, especially when applied to African-Americans.  Following\nhis shower, Plaintiff was issued prison clothing to wear.  Plaintiff remained incarcerated until on or\nabout November 6, 2008, when all charges against him were dismissed.  \nPlaintiff argues the strip search and delousing policy as applied to pretrial detainees\ncharged with misdemeanors or other m inor crimes is unconstitutional under the Fourth and\nFourteenth Amendments and 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  As a result of the policy, Plaintiff claims to have\nsuffered psychological pain, humiliation, suffering, and mental anguish.  Plaintiff brings this action\non behalf of him self and others sim ilarly situated seeking declaratory and injunctive re lief,\ncompensatory damages, and attorneys’ fees and costs.  On the other hand, Defendants contend that\nthe strip search policy and the delousing procedures are necessary for safety and health reasons.\nThus, Defendants argue the policies do not violate the Fourth Amendment. \nII.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\nIn Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007), the United States Supreme\nCourt disavowed the “no set of facts” language found in Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41 (1957),\nwhich was long used to evaluate complaints subject to 12(b)(6) motions. 550 U.S. at 563.  In its\nplace, courts must now look for “plausibility” in the complaint.  This standard requires a plaintiff\nto set forth the “grounds” f or an “entitle[ment] to relief” that is m ore than mere “labels and\nconclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.” Id. at 555.\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  Accepting the factual allegations in the complaint\n-3-\n\nas true (even when doubtful), the allegations “must be enough to raise a right to relief above the\nspeculative level . . . .” Id. (citations omitted).  If the allegations in the complaint, assuming their\ntruth, do “not raise a claim of entitlement to relief, this basic deficiency should . . . be exposed at the\npoint of minimum expenditure of time and money by the parties and the court.” Id. at 558 (internal\nquotation marks and citations omitted).  \nIn Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937 (2009), the Suprem e Court explained the\nrequirements of Rule 8 and the “plausibility standard” in more detail.  In Iqbal, the Supreme Court\nreiterated that Rule 8 does not demand “detailed factual allegations[.]” 129 S. Ct. at 1949 (internal\nquotation marks and citations omitted).  However, a mere “unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-\nharmed-me accusation” is insufficient.  Id.  “To survive a m otion to dismiss, a complaint must\ncontain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its\nface.’” Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570).  Facial plausibility exists when a claim contains\n“factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable\nfor the misconduct alleged.” Id. (citation omitted).  The Supreme Court continued by explaining that,\nalthough factual allegations in a complaint must be accepted as true for purposes of a m otion to\ndismiss, this tenet does not apply to legal conclusions. Id.  “Threadbare recitals of the elements of\na cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.” Id. (citation omitted).\nWhether a plausible claim is stated in a complaint requires a court to conduct a context-specific\nanalysis, drawing upon the court’s own judicial experience and common sense. Id. at 1950.  If the\ncourt finds from its analysis that “the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than\nthe mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged-but it has not ‘show[n]’- ‘that the\n-4-\n\npleader is entitled to relief.’” Id. (quoting, in part, Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).  The Supr eme Court\nfurther articulated that “a court considering a motion to dismiss can choose to begin by identifying\npleadings that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth.\nWhile legal conclusions can provide the f ramework of a complaint, they must be supported by\nfactual allegations.” Id.\nIII.\nDISCUSSION\nA.\nThe Strip Search Policy\nThe issue facing the Court int his case is whether the alleged blanket strip search and\ndelousing policy is constitutional.  The parties agere that this issue is controlled by the United States\nSupreme Court’s benchmark decision in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979).  InB ell, the Court was\nasked to consider the constitutional rights of  pretrial detainees who were subject to a variety of\ncorrectional conditions and practices at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC). 441 U.S. at\n523.2  The Court began by recognizing that, under the Due Process Clause, a condition of\nconfinement for a pretrial detainee cannot amount to a punishment. Id. at 535-36 n.16.  However,\nthe Court was careful to state that not every restriction placed upon a pretrial detainee i s a\npunishment under the Constitution.  Clearly, the gove rnment must have the power to ef fectuate\ndetention when necessary.  “Loss of freedom  of choice and privacy are inherent incidents of\nconfinement in such a facility.” Id. at 537.  The fact that confinement interferes with a detainee’s\n2MCC was a federally-run short-term facility that primarily housed pretrial detainees. Id.\nThere were, however, some convicted inmates at the facility. Id. at 524.\n-5-\n\ncomfort and restraint le vels “does not convert the conditions or restrictions of detention into\n‘punishment.’” Id.\nIn determining when the constitutional line is crossed, “[a] court must decide whether\nthe disability is imposed for the purpose of punishment or whether it is but an incident of some other\nlegitimate governmental purpose.” Id. at 538 (citation omitted).  If there is no expressed punitive\nintent, the decision generally will rest on “‘whethera n alternative purpose to which [the restriction]\nmay rationally be connected is assignable for it, and whether it appears excessive in relation to the\nalternative purposes assigned [to it].’”  Id. (citations omitted).  If a condition or  restriction is\nreasonably related to a legitim ate governmental goal, “it does not, without m ore, amount to\n‘punishment.’” Id. at 539 (footnote om itted).  On the othe r hand, if a condition is arbitrary or\npurposeless or otherwise not reasonably related toa  governmental objective, a court “may infer that\nthe purpose of the governmental action is punishment that may not constitutionally be inflicted upon\ndetainees qua detainees.” Id. (citation and footnote omitted).\nWhen deciding whether a particular policy  is constitutional, courts also m ust be\nmindful of the government’s interest in maintaining security and order at the facility and in making\nsure that “no weapons or illicit drugs reach detainees.  Restraints that are reasonably related to the\ninstitution’s interest in maintaining jail security do not, without more, constitute unconstitutional\npunishment, even if they are discomforting and are restrictions that the detainee would not have\nexperienced had he been released while awaiting trial ”  Id. at 540 (footnote omitted).  In other\nwords, effective management of a facility “is a valid objective that m ay justify imposition of\n-6-\n\nconditions and restrictions of pretrial detention and dispel any inference that such restrictions are\nintended as punishment.” Id. (footnote omitted).\nThe Court also identified several general principles guiding the constitutionality of\nrestrictions.  First, the Court said “convicted prisoners do not forfeit all constitutional protections\nby reason of their conviction and confinement in prison.” Id. at 545 (citations omitted).  Second,\nalthough inmates maintain some constitutional rights, it “does not mean that these rights are not\nsubject to restrictions and limitations.” Id.  Third, institutional security, order, and discipline are all\n“essential goals that may require limitation or retraction of the retained constitutional rights of both\nconvicted prisoners and pretrial detainees.” Id. at 546.  In this regard, the Court said in a footnote\nthat “[t]here is no basis for concluding that pretrial detainees pose any lesser security risk than\nconvicted inmates.” Id. at 547 n. 28.  Lastly, it is im portant to recognize that there are not  easy\nanswers to operating a correctional facility on a day-to-day basis.  “Prison administrators therefore\nshould be accorded wide-ranging deference in the adoption and execution of policies and practices\nthat in their judgm ent are needed to preserve internal order and discipline and to m aintain\ninstitutional security.” Id. (citations omitted).  The Court cautioned that lower courts must be wary\nthat such management decisions “are peculiarly within the province and professional expertise of\ncorrections officials, and, in the absence of substantial evidence in the record to indicate that the\nofficials have exaggerated their response to these considerations, courts should ordinarily defer to\ntheir expert judgment in such matters.” Id. 547-48 (citations omitted).\n-7-\n\nRelying upon this analysis, the Court proceeded to discuss some of the specific issues\nbefore it.  As relevant here, one of those issues involved vcs searches of all inmates at Bureau of\nPrison facilities, including MCC, after every contact visit with an outsider. Id. at 558.  Correctional\nofficials testified such searches were necessary to prevent and deter the sm uggling of weapons,\ndrugs, and other contraband into the facilities. Id.  Although the practice gave the Court pause, it\nnonetheless held that it did not violate the reasonbaleness requirement of the Fourth Amendment for\neither convicted prisoners or pretrial detainees. Id.  Under the Fourth Amendment, reasonableness\n“requires a balancing of the need for the particula srearch against the invasion of personal rights that\nthe search entails.  Courts must consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which\nit is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.” Id. at 559\n(citations omitted).  In acknowledging the security issues arising in a detention facility, the Court\nnoted the prevalence of smuggling items into facilities and stated that “inmate attempts to secrete\nthese items into the facility by concealing them in body cavities are documented in this record and\nin other cases.” Id. (citations omitted).  The Court further said the fact that there was only one\ndocumented instance of an MCC inmate attempting to smuggle in contraband on his person may\ndemonstrate the deterrent effect of the policy. Id.  Balancing the security interests against privacy\ninterests, the Court concluded that a vcs search under the MCC rules can “be conducted on less than\nprobable cause.” Id. at 560.  \nTwo years after the  Bell decision, the Fourth Ci rcuit was confronted with the\nreasonableness of a visual strip s earch in Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007 (4th Cir. 1981).  The\nplaintiff Lucy Logan was involved in an auto  accident and was suspected of driving while\n-8-\n\nintoxicated (DWI). 660 F.2d at 1009.  Ms. Logan  was taken to the Arlington County Detention\nCenter, but refused to take a breathalyzer test.   A magistrate judge issued warrants for DWI and\nrefusal to take the test.  Ms. Logan was booked on teh charges, and the magistrate judge ordered her\nreleased on her own recognizanc e. Id. at 1010.  However, to ensure Ms. Logan’s sobriety, the\nmagistrate judge directed that she could not leave the facility for four hours unless a responsible\nperson picked her up. Id.\nPrior to Ms. Logan being given the opportunity to call som eone to pick her up, a\nfemale deputy sheriff inventoried her personal property, took her to a holding cell, and conducted\na visual strip search pursuant to an established policy that all persons held at the  Center be strip\nsearched for weapons or contraband regardless of the offense.  The policy was adopted “after a\ndeputy allegedly was shot by a misdemeanant who had not been strip-searched.” Id.  Following the\nsearch, Ms. Logan was allowed to call a friend and was released upon her friend’s arrival.  Id.\nThereafter, Ms. Logan filed suit alleging, in part, that the strip search policy was unreasonable in\nits scope and manner. Id. at 1011.  Upon consideration of the evidence, the Fourth Circuit agreed.\nIn so holding, the Fourth Circuit relied uponB ell and found that the “strip search bore\nno . . . discernible relationship to security needs a tthe Detention Center that, when balanced against\nthe ultimate invasion of personal rights involved, it could reasonably be thought justified.” Id. at\n1013.  The Court noted that detainees, like Ms. L ogan, were not intermingled with the general\npopulation,  her off ense  was not one com monly  associated  with possession of   weapons or\ncontraband, there was no reason to believe she was harboring a weapon or contraband, and she was\n-9-\n\nat the facility an hour and a halfb efore she was subject to the strpi search and she had not even been\npatted down.  The Fourth Circuit held that “[a]n indiscriminate strip search policy routinely applied\nto detainees such as Logan along with all otherd etainees cannot be constitutionally justified simply\non the basis of administrative ease in attending to security considerations.” Id.  (citation omitted).\nSince Logan was decided in 1981 num erous other district court’s and the vast\nmajority of courts of appeals have found strip searches of pretrial detainees, who are arrested for\nmisdemeanor offenses, unconstitutional in an absen ce of some particulari zed suspicion that a\nspecific individual may have contraband.  For instance, inM  ary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d\n1263 (7th Cir. 1984), the Seventh Circuit cited bothB ell and Logan in striking down a policy by the\nCity of Chicago that required strip and vcs searches “of all women arrested and detained in the City\nlockups, regardless of the charges against the women and without regard to whether the arresting\nofficers or detention aides had reason to belie ve that the women were concealing weapons or\ncontraband on their persons.” 723 F.2d at 1266.  \nThe plaintiffs in Mary Beth G. were women arrested on misdemeanor offenses and\nwere detained while awaiting bail money. Id.  The Seventh Circuit observed that the balancing test\nprescribed in . . . [Bell] does not validate strip searches in detention settings per se.”  Id. at 1272\n(citations omitted).  Although the Supreme Court upheld the strip search inB ell, the Seventh Circuit\nstated it did so on much different facts.  Thus, the Court found it necessary to apply the balancing\ntest announced in Bell to the facts before it.  \n-10-\n\nIn doing so, the Seventh Circuit remarked that there are few instances that invade an\nindividual’s privacy more than a vcs search.  The City argued, however, that such searches were\nnecessary to prevent misdemeanor offenders from bringing weapons and contraband into the lockup\nfacilities.  Despite these arguments, the Seventh Circuit found that only a few items over the years\nwere ever discovered during a body cavity search of women arrested for minor offenses. Id.  Thus,\nthe Seventh Circuit found using Bell’s balancing test that “the strip searches bore an insubstantial\nrelationship to security needs” and cannot be considered reasonable under these facts. Id. at 1273\n(citing Logan).3 \nMore recently in Allison v. The GEO Group, Inc. , 611 F. Supp.2d 433 (E.D. Pa.\n2009), the district court, as here, was confronted with a blanket strip search policy of all arrestees\ndetained at one of the custodial facilities operated by the defendant.  The searches allegedly were\nconducted irrespective of any reasonable suspicion or probable cause that the individual being\nsearched had any contraband. Id. at 438.  The district court recognized that detention situations\nobviously require the curtailment of rights, including personal privacy and Fourth Am endment\nrights.  In addition, courts should limit their roles in the administration of detention facilities. Id. at\n442 (citations omitted).  The court then proceeded to discuss Bell’s reasonableness test and noted\n3The policy also was challenged on equal protetcion grounds because it did not apply to men.\nId. at 1266.  The Seventh Circuit found, as an additional ground, that the policy vi olated the\nFourteenth Amendment’s equal protection clause. Id. at 1274.\n-11-\n\nthat most courts addressing custodial strip searches have relied upon that test in evaluating claims.\nId. at 448.4   \n4The defendant in Allison, however, argued thatB  ell no longer controlled such decisions, but\nrather, the court should rely upon the holdings in  Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517 (1984), and\nTurner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78 (1987).  \nIn Hudson, the Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality under the Fourth Amendment\nof searching prisoners’ cells.  TheC  ourt held that “society is notp repared to recognize as legitimate\nany subjective expectation of privacy that a prisoner m ight have in his prison cell and that,\naccordingly, the Fourth Amendment proscription against unreasonable searches does not apply\nwithin the confines of the prison cell.” 468 U.S. at 526.  In Turner, inmates had challenged under\nthe First and Fourteenth Amendment certain prison regulations related to inm ate marriages and\ninmate-to-inmate correspondence. 482 U.S. at 81.  In that case, the Court announced a four-part test\nto consider in determining the reasonableness of a prison restriction, which includes:  (1) whether\nthere is “a ‘valid, rational connection’ between the prison regulation and the legitimate governmental\ninterest put forward to justify it[;]” (2) “whether there are alternative means of exercising the right\nthat remain open to prison inmates[;]” (3) “the impact accommodation of the asserted constitutional\nright will have on guards and other inmates, and on the allocation of prison resources generally[;]”\nand (4) “the absence of ready alternatives is evidence of the reasonableness of a prison regulation.”\nId. at 89-90 (citations omitted).\nIn rejecting both of these standards in Allison, the district court noted that neither Hudson\nnor Turner overruled Bell’s holding or analysis. 611 F. Supp.2d at 445 & 448.  In fact, a decision\nrendered by the Supreme Court on the same day as Hudson affirmed Bell’s Fourth Amendment\nassumption with regard to searching the cells of  pretrial detainees.  Id. at 445 (citing  Block v.\nRutherford, 468 U.S. 576 (1984)).  In addition, the district court found that the majority of courts\nwhich have considered the impact of Hudson upon Bell have limited Hudson to cell searches and\nhave not extended Hudson’s ruling to the constitutionality of custodial strip searches. Id. (citations\nomitted).  Likewise, the district court found that “Turner cited Bell with approval and did not at any\npoint suggest that Bell’s approach to Fourth Amendment claims should no longer be controlling\nlaw.” Id. at 448.  Moreover,  Bell specifically applied in a Fourth Amendment context of a strip\nsearch, while Turner challenged other polices under the First and Fourteenth Amendment, which\nare irrelevant here.  Although the district court noetd that both the Second and Ninth Circuit mention\nTurner’s analysis in custodial strip search cases, the district court was not persuaded by their use.\nId. at 447-48 (citing Michenfelder v. Sumner, 860 F.2d 328 (9th Cir. 1988);I qbal v. Hasty, 490 F.3d\n143 (2d Cir. 2007); and Shain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d 56 (2d Cir. 2001).\nIn this case, Defendants mention Turner in their Memorandum of Law in Support of their\nMotion to Dismiss, however, they assert that “it is not necessary for this Court to evaluate these\nfactors as to the WVRJA strip search policy” becauseB  ell controls. Memorandum of Law, at 14; see\n(continued...)\n-12-\n\nIn applying Bell to the facts before it, the district court recognized that a vcs search\nconstitutes an extremely invasive action by theg overnment, and is “grossly disproportionate” when\nsomeone is arrested on a relatively minor offense. Id. at 452-53 (citations omitted).   “Few people\nwould think that their right of privacy in their own body, a ‘cherished value of our society,’ could\nbe jeopardized by the failure to pay parking tickets, shoplifting, or driving without a license.” Id.\n(citation omitted).  However, it is exactly what occurs when a blanket policy in enforced. Id.  The\ndistrict court noted that “[c]ourts that strike downb lanket strip search policies for detained arrestees\nconclude that the two justifications which supported the constitutionality of the MCC policy for\ncontact visit strip searches are lacking in the arrestee context.” Id. at 454 (citation omitted).  \nFirst, arrests and detention are usually“ unplanned events,” with little opportunity to\nsmuggle contraband. Id. (citations and internal quotation omitted).  In addition, it is likely that any\ncontraband would be uncovered “during a valid searchi ncident to arrest or a less intrusive custodial\nsearch.” Id. (citations omitted).  Moreover, when an individual is arrested on an offense that is not\ncommonly associated with weapons, drugs, or other contraband, “the risk that an arrestee has\nsecreted contraband in such a way that it could only be detected by a strip search shrinks further.”\nId. (citations omitted).  Citing  Logan and Mary Beth G., the district c ourt found that “[s]trip\nsearching arrestees who are unlikely to possess, much less conceal, contraband does not serve the\n4(...continued)\nalso Defendants’ Reply in Support of its Motion to Dismiss , at 15 (stating “Bell established the\nframework by which this court m ust evaluate the W VRJA policy and  Bell remains the only\nprecedent that this court should cons ider”).  Plaintiff also argues that the  Hudson and Turner\nstandards are inapplicable.  Upon review, this Court agrees with the parties that Bell controls this\nsituation.\n-13-\n\ninstitutional security needs of a custodial facility.” Id. at 454.  Second, the district court noted that,\nas arrests are typically unplanned, there is littled eterrent effect as the Supreme Court found in Bell.\nId. at 455; see Bell, 441 U.S. at 559.  Thus, the district court stated that “[ t]hese considerations\nsignificantly weaken the effectiveness of a blanke t arrestee strip search policy and, therefore, a\ncustodial facility’s justification for enforcing it.” Id.  Balancing these considerations with the\ninvasion of privacy involved in a strip search, and the need for security in custodial facilities, the\ndistrict court agreed with the majority of courts which have determined that blanket strip search\npolicies permitting “indiscriminate searches of arrestees simply do not satisfy the basic Fourth\nAmendment requirement of reasonableness because they subject too many people to highly invasive,\nhumiliating searches that do not actually promote the institutional security interests of the custodial\nfacility.” Id. at 455 & 463.  Accordingly, the dsitrict court determined that the plaintiffs pled a viable\nclaim under the Fourth Amendment. Id. at 463.\nIn making its decision, the district court  discussed the fact that, at the tim e, the\nEleventh Circuit was the only circuit court of appeals which had determined it was constitutionally\npermissible to have a policy “of strip searching all arrestees as part of the process of booking them\ninto the general population of a detention facility,e ven without reasonable suspicion to believe that\nthey may be concealing contraband[.]” Powell v. Barrett, 541 F.3d 1298, 1300 (11th Cir. 2008).  In\nso holding, the Eleventh Circuit stated that “the security needs the Court inB ell found to justify strip\nsearching an inmate re-entering the jail population after a contact visit are no greater than those that\njustify searching an arrestee when he is beingb ooked into the general population for the first time.”\nId. at 1302.  In addition, the courtn  oted the strip searches in Bell actually were more intrusive than\n-14-\n\nthe ones challenged in the case before it.  Thus, the Eleventh Circuit found “[i]t follows from the\nBell decision that the less intrusive searches int his case do not violate the Fourth Amendment.” Id.\nAfter briefing was complete in this case, a sharply divided Ninth Circuit in Bull v.\nCity and County of San Francisco, 595 F.3d 964 (9th Cir. 2010), overruled its prior holdings and\njoined the Eleventh Circuit in finding that a policy requiring strip searches of all arrestees placed\nin the general jail population did not violate the Fourth Amendment. 595 F.3d at 982.  According\nto jail administrators, the policy in  Bull was instituted because there was a serious probl em of\nsmuggling into the jail system. Id. at 966.  Jail administrators also “concluded that, based on their\nexperience, ‘the greatest opportunity for the introduction of drugs and weapons into the jail occurs\nat the point when an arrestee is received into the jail for booking and, thereafter, housing.’” Id. at\n967.\nPreviously, in Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614 (9th Cir. 1984) (per curiam),5 the\nNinth Circuit held that strip searches of an arrsetee for a minor offense cannot be justified on the fact\nthe arrestee will be placed in contact with the general inmate population.  Rather, it must be based\nupon individualized reasonable suspicion that the arrestee has contraband. 746 F.2d at 617.  IBnu ll,\nthe majority found that conclusion was inconsistent with Bell as the Supreme Court made no such\nrequirement.  “Rather, the Supreme Court upheld a policy of strip searching all persons who had\ncontact visits as categorically reasonable under the circum stances in the detention facility.  Id.\n5Overruled on other grounds by Hodgers-Durgin v. de la Vin,a 199 F.3d 1037, 1040 n. 1 (9th\nCir. 1999 (en banc).\n-15-\n\n(citations omitted).  In addition, the Ninth Circuit in  Bull disavowed its previous finding “that\narrestees charged with minor offenses ‘pose no security threat to the facility.’” 595 F.3d at 978\n(citing Giles, 746 F.2d at 618) (footnote omitted).  Again, the Ninth Circuit stated that Bell made\nno such requirement and the Supreme Court said nothing about modifying the policy based upon the\nnature of inmate’s underlying offense. Id.  \nNext, the Ninth Circuit found a record of smuggling was not necessary under Bell\nbecause of the deterrent effect a strip search policy may have. Id. at 979.  Lastly, the Ninth Circuit\nrejected its previous finding that arrests are normally unplanned events and, therefore, it is less likely\nthat an arrestee has contraband than an inmate after a contact visit. Id.  In this respect, the majority\nagreed with Eleventh Circuit’s reasoning inP owell which stated the fallacy in the “unplanned event”\nposition is that many individuals know when officers are coming to arrest them on warrants, others\nvoluntarily surrender to police, and some get themselves deliberately arrested.  In addition, even\nthose arrested pursuant to a vehicle stop may have time to hide contraband before an officer reaches\nthe vehicle. Id. at 980 (quoting Powell, 541 F.3d at 1313).  Accordingly, the m ajority found no\nmeaningful distinction between the policy in Bull and the one in Bell and, therefore, upheld the\npolicy.\nIn a sharply worded dissent, the minority stated there was absolutely no evidence in\nthe record of any arrestee hiding contraband with the intent to smuggle it into jail.  Moreover, there\nwas not anyone in the proposedc lass who was found to possess contraband when strip searched. Id.\nat 990.  Likewise, there is not even anecdotal support for the notion that soem detainees get arrested\n-16-\n\nfor the purpose of smuggling contraband into jail. Id. at 998-99.  The dissent stated that all but the\nEleventh Circuit rejected the majority’s approach because “[s]uspicionless, routine, mandatory strip\nsearch policies flatly contradict the balancing of interests that the Supreme Court has instructed us\nto undertake.” Id. at 991.  The majority’s holding simply legitimizes “abusive, unnecessary body\ncavity searches of those who pose no s ecurity risk.” Id.  The dissent emphasized the degrading\nnature of strip searches requires a strong justification by the government. Id. at 1001.  However, in\nthe case before it, the dissent found no justification for the policy, “aside from minor bureaucratic\ninconvenience. . . .  Judicial review cannot be halted when the governm ent’s rationale is simply\n‘because I said so.’  Under proper, deferential judicial review, . . . [the] body cavity search policy\ncannot pass constitutional muster.” Id.  In ending, the dissent pointedly stated that “[i]nvading the\nrights of everyone, regardless of whether we haver eason to suspect them or not, should give no one\nillusory comfort that we are providing justice for all.” Id. at 1004.6\n Defendant contends that this Court should adopt the Eleventh Circuit’s decision in\nPowell7 as the policy there is substantiallys imilar to the policy at issue here8.  Defendant also asserts\n6The dissent also strongly disagreed with the majority’s suggestion that Turner may supplant\nBell’s analysis.  Although the majority did discuss the factors inT urner, it first concluded underB  ell\nthat the strip search policy was reasonable and therefore did not violate the class members’ Fourth\nAmendment rights.” Id. at 975.  The majority then stated that “[b]ecause the Turner factors require\nus to give more deference to detention officials’ determinations than does the balancing test inB  ell,\nit is not surprising that our consideration of theT  urner factors leads to the same conclusion.” Id. at\n975-76.\n7Presumably, if the Court permitted additional briefing on the issue, Defendants also would\nargue the Court likewise should follow the decision in Bull.\n8Defendants contend that the only difference in the policies is that the W VJRA policy\nrequires searches be conducted in an area not visible to other inm ates, prison employees not\n(continued...)\n-17-\n\nthe Court should disregard the cases from other jurisdictions because they are factually diverse and\nmany merely challenge the particular conditions ofa  search rather than whether a policy, on its own,\nis constitutional.  Although the Court recognizes thereis  a wide variety of factual scenarios and legal\nchallenges in the strip search cases cited by Plaintiff, the overarching theme of those cases is that\nBell’s teaching requires “a detainee held on a misdemeanor charge not related to weapons or drugs\nmay not be strip searched absent individualized erasonable suspicion that he or she is carrying such\ncontraband.” Young v. County of Cook, 616 F. Supp.2d 834, 846 (N.D. Ill. 2009); see also Smith v.\nMontgomery County, Maryland, 643 F. Supp. 435, 440 (D. Md. 1986) (stating “courts have found\nthat strip searches of detainees arrested on minor offenses violate the Fourth Amendment”). \n Although the parties spend a  great deal of time discussing cases from  other\njurisdictions and those discussions are helpful in framing and understanding the issues, in the end,\nthis Court must be consistent with the Fourth Circuit’s application of  Bell.  In quoting Bell, the\nFourth Circuit in Logan held:\nStrip  searches of   detainees are constitutionally\nconstrained  by due process requirem ents  of\nreasonableness under the circum stances.  “In each\ncase  it requires a balancing of the need for   the\nparticular search against the invasion of personal\nrights that the search entails.  Courts m ust consider\nthe scope of the particular intrusion, t he manner in\nwhich it is conducted, the justification for initiating it,\nand the place in which it is conducted.”\n8(...continued)\ninvolved in the search, or the public.  InP  owell, the searches were conducted with up to forty other\ninmates.  541 F.3d at 1301.\n-18-\n\n660 F.2d at 1013 (quoting  Bell, 441 U.S. at 559).  The Fourth Circuit then conc luded that the\nSheriff’s policy of strip searching “all persons held at the Detention Center for weapons or\ncontraband regardless of their offense” “was conclusively shown to be unconstitutional under the\nstandards laid out in Bell[.]” 660 F.2d at 1010 & 1013.\nDefendants argue, however, that the facts of Logan distinguish it from this case in\nthat, unlike Plaintiff in this case, Ms. Logan was never intermingled with the general population.\nDefendant argues intermingling with the general population increases the security risk and justifies\nthe policy.  However, Plaintiff asserts the proposed class includes all individuals who were strip\nsearched prior to being arraigned and, presumably, many of those individuals were released before\nbeing intermingled.9  Thus, they fall precisely in line with the facts in Logan.\nAssuming, as this Court must for purposes of this motion to dismiss, the truth of\nPlaintiff’s allegation that the policy applies broadly to all pretrial detainees regardless of whether\nthey are intermingled, the policy strikes directly in the face of the policy struck down in Logan.  If\ntrue, the blanket nature of the policy clearly would be unconstitutional.  Nevertheless, Defendant\nargues that Plaintiff’s claim cannot survive because reasonable suspicion existed to strip search him\nin this case.  Defendants make a number of factual allegations against Plaintiff which they assert\nwarranted the search.  In his First Amended Class Action Complaint, Plaintiff alleges his “arrest was\n9In paragraph 31 of the First Amended Class Action Complaint, Plaintiff alleges “[t]he strip\nsearches and delousing discussed in this complaint are often imposed upon pre-trial detainees prior\nto their arraignment before a judge.  Upon information and belief, many members of the proposed\nclass are bailed out of custody shortly after being arraigned.”  First Amended Class Action\nComplaint, at ¶ 31.\n-19-\n\nvoid of any reasonable suspicion that h eharbored any weapons or contraband.” First Amended Class\nAction Complaint, at ¶ 38, in part.10  Again, for purposes of a motion to dismiss, this Court must\naccept the truth of Plaintiff’s allegations.  Having done so, the CourtD  ENIES Defendant’s motion\nto dismiss with respect to Plaintiff’s challenge of the strip search policy.\nB.\nThe Delousing Policy\nThe next issue the Court must address is whether Defendants’ delousing policy is\nunconstitutional.  The Court recognizes there are few cases which discuss delousing policies and the\nparties cite none within this circuit.  In support of their m otion, Defendants rely upon Russell v.\nRichards, 384 F.3d 444 (7th Cir. 2004).  In  Russell, the Seventh Circuit was asked to consider\nwhether a “jail’s policy of directing that all incoming inmates to use a delousing shampoo violated\ntheir Fourteenth Amendment due process right to be free from unwanted medical treatment.” 384\nF.3d at 446.  The plaintiffs in  Russell were minor, non-violent offenders who were arrested and\ntaken to jail.  Upon arrival, incoming inmates were given a cup of Liceall and told to apply it to their\nscalp and then shower it out.  There was no m onitoring of its use and no way to verify that the\ninmates actually used it.  In addition, although inmates were not told they can refuse to use it, the\njail’s position was that they may refuse. Id.\n10In addition, although Defendants contend that Plaintiff’s arrest and actions on September\n28, 2008, provided reasonable suspicion for the strip search, Plaintiff maintains that he was held at\nWVRJA facilities on m ultiple occasions and counsel  has not had the opportuni ty to take any\ndiscovery into the circumstances of those other instances.  In addition, Plaintiff argues that he will\ndemonstrate that the facts now citedb y Defendants are nothing more than a post hoc effort to justify\nhis strip search and delousing under the blanket policy.  Specifically, Plaintiff asserts that it is not\neven known yet whether the correctional officers knew what he was charged with when he entered\nthe facility.  Plaintiff argues that these are all issues for which discovery is appropriate and which\nare more properly dealt with on a motion for summary judgment, not a motion to dismiss.\n-20-\n\nThe jail administrators justified their policy on the grounds that they were trying to\nprevent lice infestations, which, if they occur, are difficult and time consuming to ameliorate.  Id.\nHowever, the manner in which they attempted to prevent infestations through the policy had some\nserious flaws.  In addition to the f act that there was no effort made to ensure incoming inmates\nactually used the delousing solution, the instructions for Liceall were not followed.  For instance,\ninmates were never told they had to leave it on  their hair for ten minutes and were not given a\nsecond application.  In addition, inmates were not told to put Liceall on other parts of their bodies\nwhere lice may be present. Id.  The instructions also cautioned that individuals allergic to ragweed\ncould have a reaction, but inmates were never given this warning. Id. at 446-47.\nIn discussing the policy, the Seventh Circuit assum ed without deciding that the\napplication of Liceall constitute a medical treatment, which implicates an “inmate’s constitutionally-\nprotected interest in refusing unwanted m edical treatment.  Id. at 447 (citations and footnote\nomitted).  The Seventh Circuit then proceeded to discuss the policy under the test announced in\nTurner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78 (1987), to determine its reasonableness.  The reasonableness test under\nTurner includes: (1) whether there is “a ‘valid, rational connection’ between the prison regulation\nand the legitimate governmental interest put forw ard to justify it[;]” (2) “whether there are\nalternative means of exercising the right that r emain open to prison inmates[;]” (3) “the impact\naccommodation of the asserted constitutional right will have on guards and other inmates, and on\nthe allocation of prison resources generally[;]” and ()4 “the absence of ready alternatives is evidence\nof the reasonableness of a prison regulation.”  482 U.S. at 89-90 (citations omitted).\n-21-\n\nAnalyzing  factors  (1), (3), and (4), 11  the Seventh Circuit found there was a\nsatisfactory justification between the policy and the jail’s justification for it despite the problems\nnoted with how it was being administered. 384 F.3d at 448 & 450.  Specificalyl, the Seventh Circuit\nstated that if inmates were accommodated by being told they could refuse treatment, it could result\nin lice infestations. Id. at 448-49.  In addition, the Seventh Circuit found no evidence in the record\nas to the effectiveness or cost of directing examinations for lice prior to using the solution so that\nit only would be given to those actually infected.  Indeed, the Seventh Circuit observed that some\ninmates may consider a close examination of their hair more intrusive then just being given the\ntreatment. Id. at 449.  Therefore, the Seventh Circuit concluded “the record  . . . [did] not support\nthe conclusion that the jail’s policy with respect to delousing shampoo amounts to an unreasonable\nintrusion on an inmate’s constitutional rights.” Id.\nPlaintiff argues that Russell is distinguishable from this case because it was brought\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment and the inmates were given the product to apply themselves and\nthere was no monitoring by prison personnel.  To the contrary, Plaintiff points out he has filed a\nFourth Amendment challenge to the policy and it involves prison officials spraying the product on\nnaked detainees.  In support of his position that this policy is unconstitutional, Plaintiff citesD  oan\nv. Watson, 168 F. Supp.2d 932 (S.D. In. 2001).12\n11The Seventh Circuit stated that factor number 2 is irrelevant in the context of involuntary\nmedical treatment. Id. at 448 n. 2 (citing Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210 (1990)).\n12Plaintiff also cites Wilson v. County of Gloucester, 256 F.R.D. 479 (D. N.J. 2009), and\nGwiazdowski v. County of Chester, 263 F.R.D. 178 (E.D. Pa. 2009).  In Wilson, the district court\nfound common issues of law and fact for class action purposes exist as to the purpose of supervised\n(continued...)\n-22-\n\nIn Doan, individuals arrested on misdemeanor offenses were strip searched, sprayed\nwith a delousing solution, and then told to shower. 168 F. Supp.2d at 933.  The district court found\n“the delousing procedure included the essential elements of the strip search” and, therefore, the\nFourth Amendment and Bell’s reasonableness test applied. Id. at 936.  Finding the strip searches in\nDoan “closely resemble the searches at issue inM  ary Beth G., the district court found the defendants\nfailed to “demonstrate[] any factual basis to relate the blanket strip search policy to legitim ate\nsecurity interests.” Id. at 936.  Without any further discussion about the reasonableness under Bell\nof the delousing policy, the district court found  it violated the Fourth Amendment right against\nunreasonable searches. Id. at 937.\nAs the current action challenges the delousing policy on Fourth Amendment grounds,\nthe Court finds that the reasonable ness test in Bell is more relevant than the test announced in\nTurner.  However, there is no record in this case upon which this Court can applyB ell’s test.  Based\nupon Plaintiff’s allegations, the delousing policy  was a blanket policy which applied to pretrial\ndetainees prior to arraignment with some of those detainees presumably being released without ever\nbeing housed with the general population.  At firstg lance, a court may sweep this challenge up with\nthe strip search challenge and declare it unreasona ble.  However, such result does not take into\naccount that Defendants should be given the opportunity to present evidence and argum ents\n12(...continued)\nshower and delousing policies. 263 F.R.D. at 486.  In  Gwiazdowski, the district court found the\ndelousing policy, which required a visual inspection of the inmate for wounds and sores, a strip\nsearch.  Nevertheless, it did not decide whether the policy viol ated the Fourth Am endment’s\nreasonableness standard.  It stated its finding was only relevant for class certification purposes, and\nit did not bind the finder of fact on the merits. 263 F.R.D. at 186.\n-23-\n\njustifying the delousing policy on its own merits.13  The Court will not sit and ponder all the possible\njustifications and evidence that Defendants may cite in support of its delousing policy.  Suffice it\nto say, the Court believes it is necessary to i ndependently examine the reasonableness of the\ndelousing policy.14  Therefore, t he Court DENIES Defendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s\nchallenge of this policy.\nC.\nImmunity\nDefendants further assert that Plaintiff’s claims against them are barred under the\nEleventh Amendment and Will v. Michigan Department of State Polic,e 491 U.S. 58 (1989).  InW  ill,\nthe Supreme Court stated “that neither a State nor its officials acting in their official capacities are\n‘persons’ under § 1983.” 491 U.S. at 71.  It is well established that the WVRJA is an agency of the\nState of West Virginia and is not a “person” within the meaning of § 1983 for purposes of an action\nseeking money damages. See Roach v. Burke, 825 F. Supp. 116, 118 (N.D. W. Va. 1993) (holding\nthat the WVRJA is not a person amenable to suit under § 1983);s ee also Lavender v. West Virginia\nReg’l Jail Auth. and Corr. Facility Auth., No. 3:06-1032,  2008 WL 313957 (S.D. W. Va. 2008)\n(same).  “An individual defendant employed . . . [by the WVRJA] and sued in his official capacity\nis also immune from suit in federal court under the El eventh Amendment.” Edwards v. West\n13For instance, the Court can imagine Defendants may attempt to distinguish delousing from\na search for weapons on the basis that, merely because someone is arrested on a misdemeanor, it\ndoes not mean they are any less likely to have lice as som e courts have held is the situation in\nsearching for weapons and other contraband.\n14To be clear, the Court is not saying that a detainee being nude in front of a prison official\nis not a factor the Court will  consider in weighing the reasonableness of  the delousing policy.\nHowever, it is but one of the many factors the Court must consider in applying the reasonableness\ntest.\n-24-\n\nVirginia, No. 2:00-0775, 2002 W L 34364404 (S.D. W . Va. 2002).  Thus, a claim  for money\ndamages against these Defendants acting in their official capacity is barred by the Eleventh\nAmendment. See Gillette v. West Virginia, No. Civ. A. 2:01-1309, 2003W  L 23522062 (S.D. W. Va.\nJune 6, 2003) (holding the WVRJA “is an agency of the State . . . . [and] [a] . . . suit for m oney\ndamages is barred by the Eleventh Amendment”). \nHowever, as pointed out by Plaintiff, he has not filed any claims for monetary relief\nunder § 1983 against De fendants in their official capacities.  Rather, his claim s against both\nDefendants in their official capacities are for declaratory judgm ent and injunctive relief.  The\nSupreme Court in Will very clearly held that “a state official in his or her official capacity, when\nsued for injunctive relief, would be a person under § 1983 because ‘offi cial-capacity actions for\nprospective relief are not treated as actions against the State.’” Will, 491 U.S. at 71 n.10 (citation\nomitted); see also Frew v. Hawkins, 540 U.S. 431, 437 (2004) (stating “t[]o ensure the enforcement\nof federal law, however, the Eleventh Amendment permits suits for prospective injunctive relief\nagainst state officials acting in violation  of federal law”).  Accordingly, the Court  DENIES\nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s claims against them in their official capacities.\nDefendant Miller also moves to dismiss the claim against him in his individual\ncapacity on the basis of qualified immunity.  Defendant Miller asserts that it is clear the allegations\nagainst him are made for actions he took in furtherance of his official duties and not because he, in\nhis individual capacity, deprived Plaintiff of any rights.  However, the Eleventh Amendment does\nnot bar suits under § 1983 for money damages against defendants sued in their individual capacities\n-25-\n\nmerely because “the alleged wrongdoing was conduc ted while in performance of their official\ncapacity.” Roach, 825 F. Supp. at 118;  Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, 27 (1991) (rejecting the\npetitioner’s argument that “[u]nder Will, . . . state officials may not be held liable in their personal\ncapacity for actions they take in their official  capacity”).  The doctrine of  qualified immunity,\nhowever, does protect public officials performing discretionary functions from civil liability if they\ncan show that their conduct did “not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of\nwhich a reasonable person would have known.”W ilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 609 (1999); (quoting\nHarlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982)).  \nThe threshold question a court must answer when qualified immunity is raised is:\n“Taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, do the facts alleged show the\nofficer's conduct violated a constitutional right?” Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001)1.5  If the\nanswer to this question is no, the inquiry ends. Id.  If, on the other hand, the answer is yes, then the\ncourt must determine whether the right was clearly established in the specific context of the case.\nId.\nIn this case, there are two alleged actionsw hich the Court will address separately ofr\nqualified immunity purposes.  The first action is the actual strip search.  As discussed above, taking\nPlaintiff’s allegations as true, the Court has no difficulty finding the strip search policy violates a\n15Although it often will be appropriate to conduct the qualified immunity analysis by first\ndetermining whether a constitutional violation occurred and by next determ ining whether the\nconstitutional right was clearly established, the or der of that two-step protocol is no longer\nmandatory. Pearson v. Callahan, 129 S. Ct. 808 (2009) (overruling Saucier).\n-26-\n\nconstitutional right and such right was clearly established underL ogan.  As governmental officials\nare held to have “presumptive knowledge of and respect for ‘basic, unquestioned constitutional\nrights,’” and may be liable for constitutional violations when they “‘knew or reasonably should have\nknown’” their actions violated those rights,16 the Court DENIES Defendant Miller’s Motion to\nDismiss with respect to the strip search policy. \nThe second action is the delousing policy.  As mentioned above, there are very few\ncases which discuss delousing policies and there do not appear to be any cases on point within the\nFourth Circuit.  Thus, even if  the Court were to presum e at this point in the litigation that the\ndelousing policy violates a constitutional right, the Court finds it highly unlikely that a reasonable\nperson would have notice of that violation.  Nevertheless, as the Court has denied Defendants’\nMotion to Dismiss with respect to the delousing policy, the Court alsoD  ENIES Defendant Miller’s\nqualified immunity argument with respect to this policy.  The Court believes this issue is best\nresolved after the Court decidest he underlying issue regarding the policy itself, which will give both\nparties the opportunity to present evidencea nd arguments in support of their positions.S ee Amaechi\nv. West, 237 F.3d 356, 362-63 (2001) (stating that the concetp of “clearly established” includes those\nrights previously adjudicated and “those manifestly included within more general applications of\nthe core constitutional principle invoked” which would provide notice to a reasonable person in the\nofficial’s position that certain conduct violates those rights (citations and internal quotation marks\nomitted)). \n16Harlow, 457 U.S. at 815 (quotingW  ood v. Strickland, 420 U.S. 308, 322 (1975) (emphasis\nin Harlow deleted).\n-27-\n\nD.\nThe PLRA\nDefendants further argue Plaintiff’s action must be dismissed because he failed to\nexhaust his administrative remedies under the Prison Litigation Reform  Act (PLRA).  Section\n1997e(a) of the PLRA provides:  \nNo action shall be brought with respect to\nprison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or\nany other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any\njail, prison, or other corr ectional facility until such\nadministrative  remedies  as ar e  available are\nexhausted.\n42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a).  However, Plaintiff was no longer an inmate at the time he filed this action.\nTherefore, the PLRA is not applicable. See Cofield v. Bowser, 247 Fed. Appx. 413, 414, 2007 WL\n2710423, *1 (4th Cir. 2007) (unpublished) (stating because the plaintiff “was not a prisoner when\nhe filed his complaint, the PLRA exhaustion requirement is not applicable to his § 1983 action.  A\nformer inmate who has been released is no longe r ‘incarcerated or detained’ for the purposes of\n§ 1997e(h) and therefore does not qualify as a ‘prisoner’ subject to the PLRA”); Shembo v. Bailey,\nNo. 3:07cv543-RJC, 2009 WL 129974, *2 (W.D. N.C. Jan. 20, 2009) (same).  Accordingly, the\nCourt DENIES Defendants’ motion on exhaustion grounds.\nIII.\nCONCLUSION\nAccordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES Defendants’ Motion to\nDismiss.\n-28-\n\nThe Court DIRECTS the Clerk to send a copy of thisO rder to counsel of record and\nany unrepresented parties.\nENTER: August 5, 2010\nROBERT C.

For at least the past   11  years, the W est  Virginia  Regional  Jail and  \nCorrectional Facility Authority has had a policy of strip  searching all individuals who enter any \nof the West Virginia Regional Jails and placing them in jail clothing, regardless of the crime with \nwhich they are charged.  In addition, the West Virginia Regional Jail and Correctional Facility \nAuthority also requires that all pre-trial detainees be deloused by having corrections officers use \nplastic bottles to spray caustic delousing solution  over the genitals of detainees. Of particular  \nimport  to this action, the W est  Virginia Regi onal  Jail and Correctional Facility Authority \nperforms these blanket strip searches and delousing procedures on detainees who have yet to be \narraigned before a judicial officer.   These p rocedures are, in part, derived from  the written \npolicies  of  the W est  Virginia  Regional Jail  and  Correctional Facility Authority, and were \npromulgated by senior West Virginia Regional Jail and Correctional Facility Authority officials \nnamed herein. \nPlaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves, and on behalf of a Class of thousands \nof others who were deloused after being charge d with petty crimes, to vindicate the clear and \nunnecessary violation of their ci vil rights and those of the  Class Members they propose to \nrepresent.  Plaintiffs were charged with non-felony offenses, and were subjected to delousing, in \nviolation of their rights against unreasonable  searches under the Fourth Am endment of the \nUnited States Constitution.  Both Plaintiffs were also subjected to strip and visual cavity searches \nbefore being arraigned by a judicial officer, which  also represents a clear violation of their civil \n  2\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 89   Filed 09/14/12   Page 3 of 25 PageID #: 861\nrights.  The Plaintiffs seek to represent o ther similarly situated individuals who were strip \nsearched prior to being arraigne d while in the custody of the W est Virginia Regional Jail and \nCorrectional Facility Authority.    Pl aintiffs seeks monetary damages from Defendants Terry L. \nMiller, Joseph DeLong and Larry Parsons for himself and each member of the Proposed Class, a \ndeclaration that Defendant West Virginia Regional Jail and Correctional Facility Authority’s \npolicies are unconstitutional, and an injunction precluding Defendant West Virginia Regional \nJail and Correctional Facility Authority and the Individual Defendants  from continuing to \nviolate the rights of those placed  into the custody of the R egional Jails that th ey administer.  \nWith this as a background, Plaintiffs complains as follows: \nJURISDICTION \n1.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. §§ \n1331, 1341 & 1343 because it is filed to obtain com pensatory damages and injunctive relief for \nthe deprivation, under color of state law, of the ri ghts of citizens of the United States secured by \nthe Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Th is Court also has jurisdiction \nover this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. § 2201, as it is filed to obtain declaratory relief \nrelative to the constitutionality of the policies of a state government. \n2.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2 ) because a substantial p art of the \nevents or omissions giving rise to Plaintiffs’ a nd Class claims occurred within this judicial \ndistrict. \nPARTIES \n3.  Plaintiff  Michael Cantley is an adult  male  residing in C abell  County, W est \nVirginia.  On or about September 28, 2008, he was arrested and placed in the Western Regional \n  3\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 89   Filed 09/14/12   Page 4 of 25 PageID #: 862\nJail on non-felony charges of violating an order of  protection at the hom e of his ex-wife.  Mr. \nCantley was also admitted to custody of the Western Regional Jail on several other occasions \nduring the proposed class period.   \n4.  Plaintiff Teter is an adult male residing in Preston County, West Virginia.  On or \nabout February 19, 2010, he was arrested and placed in the Tygart Valley Regional Jail on non-\nfelony charges of putting materials on a highway and obstructing an officer.   \n5.  Defendant  West Virginia  Regional  Jail  and  Correctional  Facility  Authority \n(“WVRJA”) is a state government agency organized and existing under the laws of the State of \nWest Virginia.  At all tim es relevant hereto, the WVRJA was responsible for the policies, \npractices, supervision, implementation and conduct of all matters pertaining to the West Virginia \nRegional Jail System and was responsible for the appointment, training, supervision and conduct \nof all Regional Jail personnel, including those  working in the Central Regional Jail, Eastern \nRegional Jail, North Central Regional Jail, Northern Regional Jail, Potomac Highlands Regional \nJail, South Central Regional Jail, Southern Regional Jail, Southw estern Regional Jail, Tygart \nValley Regional Jail, and the Western Regional Jail (collectively the “West Virginia Regional \nJail System” or “WVRJS”).  In addition, at all  relevant times, the WVRJA was responsible for \nenforcing the rules of the W est Virginia Regional Jail System, and fo r ensuring that personnel \nemployed in West Virginia Regional Jail system obey the Constitution and laws of the United \nStates and of the State of West Virginia.   \n6.  Defendant Terry L. Miller (“Director  Miller”) was the duly appointed E xecutive \nDirector of the WVRJA, and, as such, was a policy m aker with respect to the treatment of pre-\ntrial and other detainees over which the W VRJA exercises custodial or other control.

Director Miller is m ade a Defendant in this action in both his individual \nand official capacities.  Miller was fired as Director of the WVRJA in October 2010.   \n7.  Defendant Joseph A. DeLong (“Acting Dir ector DeLong”) is the duly appointed \nActing Executive Director of the  WVRJA, and, as such, is a policy m aker with respect to the \ntreatment of pre-trial and other detainees over which the WVRJA exercises custodial and other \ncontrol.  Acting Directo r DeLong’s principal  place of business is th e WVRJA’s Office, 1325 \nVirginia Street East, C harleston, West Virginia  25301.  Acti ng Director DeLong is m ade a \nDefendant in this action in both his individua l and official capacities. Upon infor mation and \nbelief, Defendant DeLong became the Acting Executive Director of the WVRJA from October  \n2010 until April 2011, and then again in February 2012.   \n8.  Defendant Larry Parsons (“Director Pars on”) was the duly a ppointed Executive \nDirector of the WVRJA, and, as such, was a policy m aker with respect to the treatment of pre-\ntrial and other detainees over which the W VRJA exercises custodial or other control.  Director \nParsons’  principal place of business was the  WVRJA’s  Office, 1325 Vi rginia  Street  East, \nCharleston West Virginia 25301. Director Parsons is made a Defendant in this action in both his \nindividual and official capacities.  P arsons served as the Director of the WVRJA from  April 1, \n2011 until February 2, 2012.   \n9.  Collectively,  Defendants Miller, Pars ons  and DeLong are referred to the \n“Individual Defendants.” \n  5\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 89   Filed 09/14/12   Page 6 of 25 PageID #: 864\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n10.

The class period commen ces on June 30, 2007 and extends to \nthe date on which the West Virginia Regional Jail and Correctional Facility \nAuthority  is enjoined from ,  or ot herwise  ceases, enforcing its policy, \npractice and custom of conducting the uni form strip searches of pre-trial \ndetainees prior to their being provided with an initial appearance to contest \ntheir detention.  Specifica lly excluded from the class are D efendants and \nany  and all of   their respec tive  affiliates,  legal rep resentatives,  heirs, \nsuccessors, employees or assignees.   \n \nSUB-CLASS A \n \nAll persons who have been or will  be into the custody of the Central, \nPotomac Highlands or Tygart Valley  Regional Jails after being charged \nwith  misdemeanors,  summary violati ons,  violations of probation traffic \ninfractions, civil commitments or other minor crimes were or will be s trip \nsearched upon their entry into thes e Regional Jails prior to their bein g \narraigned or provided with an appropriate initial court appearance to contest \ntheir detention prior to  being searched, pursuant to the policy, custom  and \npractice  of the W est  Virginia Regi onal  Jail  and Correctional Fac ility \nAuthority.  The class period commen ces on June 30, 2007 and extends to \nthe date on which the West Virginia Regional Jail and Correctional Facility \nAuthority  is enjoined from ,  or ot herwise  ceases, enforcing its policy, \npractice and custom of conducting the uni form strip searches of pre-trial \ndetainees prior to their being provided with an initial appearance to contest \ntheir detention.

This action has been brought and m ay properly be maintained as a Class action \nunder  Federal law an d  satisfies  the num erosity,  commonality,  typicality and adequacy \nrequirements for maintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n13.  The members of the Class are so n umerous as to render jo inder impracticable.  \nUpon  information  and belief, there are hundreds  of  people arrested for m isdemeanors  and \nviolations who are placed into  the custody of the W est Virginia Regional Jail System  every \nmonth -- all of whom are members of the Proposed Class.  Upon information and belief, the size \n  7\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 89   Filed 09/14/12   Page 8 of 25 PageID #: 866\nof the Proposed Class totals at least thousands of individuals, some of whom have had their civil \nrights violated on multiple occasions. \n14.  Upon information and belief, joinder of a ll of these individuals is im practicable \nbecause of the larg e number of Class Mem bers and the fact that Class Mem bers are likely \ndispersed over a large geographical area, with some members presently residing outside of West \nVirginia and this Judicial District.  Furthermore, upon information and belief, many members of \nthe Class are low-income persons, may not speak English, and likely would have great difficulty \nin pursuing their rights individually. \n15.  Common questions of law and f act exist as to all members of the Class, in that \nthey all had their right to be free from unreasonable searches and involuntary delousing violated \nby Defendants’ conducting strip searches absent pa rticularized suspicion.  All m embers of the \nClass were charged with misdemeanors or summary violations when placed into th e custody of \nthe West Virginia Regional Jail System , and all  were illegally deloused in violation of the \nestablished law in this judicial circuit.  Many Class Members were also subjected to a strip and \nvisual cavity search prior to being arraigned, in violation of the es tablished law in this judicial \ncircuit.   \n16.  Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the members of the Class.  Plaintiffs \nand all members of the Class sustained dam ages arising out of Defendants’ course of conduct.  \nThe harms suffered by the Plaintiffs are typical of the harms suffered by the Class Members. \n17.  The representative Plaintiffs have the requisite personal interest in the outcome of \nthis action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class.  Plaintiffs have no \ninterests that are adverse to the interests of the Members of the Class. \n  8\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 89   Filed 09/14/12   Page 9 of 25 PageID #: 867\n18.  Plaintiffs have retained counsel with subs tantial experience in the prosecution of \nClass  action  and civil rights litigation, includin g successful  litigation of  strip search cases.   \nPlaintiffs’ counsel have the resources, expertis e and experience to succe ssfully prosecute this \naction against the WVRJA and the Individual Defendants..  Counsel for the Plaintiffs know of no \nconflicts among members of the Class or between counsel and members of the Class. \n19.  This action, in part, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.  As such, the Plaintiffs \nseek Class Certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), in that all Class Members were subject to \nthe same policy requiring the illegal strip searches and delousi ng of individuals charged with \nmisdemeanor or minor crimes and placed in to the custody of the W est Virginia Regional Jail \nSystem.  In short, the WVRJA, the Individual  Defendants and the Regional Jail personnel acted \non grounds generally applicable to all Class Members. \n20.  In addition to certification unde r Rule 23(b)(2), and in th e alternative, Plaintiffs \nseek certification under Rule 23(b)(3).   \n21.  Common questions of law and  fact exist as to all members of the Class, and \npredominate  over any questions that affect on ly  individual  members  of  the Clas s.   Thes e \ncommon questions of law and fact include,  without limitation, the common and predominate \nquestion of whether the Defendants’ written and/or de facto policy of  delousing all individuals \ncharged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and committed to the Jail is a v iolation of the \nFourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Un ited States Constitution, and whether such  a \nwritten and/or de facto policy existed during the Class Peri od.  Common questions also arise \nregarding the WVRJA’s policy, practice and/or pro cedure of strip searching detainees prior to \n  9\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 89   Filed 09/14/12   Page 10 of 25 PageID #: 868\ntheir  being arraigned or provide d  with other appropriate judici al  process  to c ontest  their \ndetention.  \n22.  A Class action is superior to other ava ilable methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy, since joinder of  all of the individual mem bers of the Class is \nimpracticable given the large number of Class Members and the fact that they are dispersed over \na large geographical area.  Furthermore, the e xpense and burden of individual litigation would \nmake it difficult or impossible for individual members of the Class to redress the wrongs done to \nthem.  The cost to the federal court system  of adjudicating thousands of individual cases would \nbe enormous.  Individualized litigation would al so magnify the delay and expense to all parties \nand the court system.  By contrast, the conduct of this action as  a Class action in this District \npresents far fewer management difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court \nsystem, and protects the rights of each member of the Class. \n23.  Upon information and belief, there are  no other actions pending to address the \nDefendants’ flagrant violation of  the civil rights of thousands  of individuals, even though the \nDefendants have maintained their illegal strip search and delousing regimen for at least the past \ntwelve years. \n24.  In the alternative to certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), Plaintiffs also \nseek partial certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4). \nFACTS \nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally \n25.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits state officials, \nsuch as the Individual Defendants in this actio n and the Corrections Officers they supervise, \n  10\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 89   Filed 09/14/12   Page 11 of 25 PageID #: 869\nfrom performing strip searches of arrestees who  have been charged with misdemeanors or other \nminor crimes, and who have not been arraigned or  provided with appropriate process to contest \ntheir  detention, unless the officer   has reasonable suspic ion  to believe that   the arrestee is \nconcealing a weapon or contraband. \n26.  The WVRJA and Director Miller have instituted a written and/or de facto policy, \ncustom or practice of strip sear ching and delousing all individuals who enter the custody of the  \nWest Virginia Regional Jail System, regardless of the nature of their charged crime and without \nthe presence of reasonable suspicion to believ e that the individual wa s concealing a weapon or \ncontraband. \n27.  In a recent filing with the Court, the WVRJA and Director Miller adm itted, \nthrough counsel, as follows:  “W VRJA maintains a policy by which all incom ing detainees go \nthrough a visual strip search and delousing pr ocedure ….Defendants acknowledge that Plaintiff \nwas  strip searched and deloused upon his ad mission  to Western Regi onal  Jail pursuant to \nWVRJA.”  (Docket Number 8, pp. 1, 4).     \n28.  The written policy of th e WVRJA also confirms this procedure.  A copy of the \nWVRJA’s  written “In mate  Admission  Procedures”  policy is attac hed  to this   Amended \nComplaint as Exhibit A.    \n29.  The WVRJA and Director Miller have instituted a written and/or de facto policy, \ncustom or practice of conducting visual body cavity  searches (visual inspection of the vaginal \nand rectal cavities) on all indivi duals who enter the custody of th e West Virginia Regional Jail \nSystem, regardless of the individual characteris tics or the nature of  their charged crime.  For \npurposes of this Complaint, strip and visual cavity searches are collectively referred to as “strip \n  11\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 89   Filed 09/14/12   Page 12 of 25 PageID #: 870\nsearches”.  These strip and visual cavity s earches include a visual insp ection of a detain ee’s \ngenitals and anus, and require detainees to m anipulate body parts to allow for an inspection of \nthese private areas.   \n30.  Upon information and belief, some members of the Proposed Class (not including \nthe Plaintiffs) are also required to undergo physical cavity searches upon entry to the custody of \nthe WVRJA, where a Corrections Officer inserts a gloved finger into the rectum of a detainee to \nsearch for contraband.   \n31.  Many of the pre-trial detainees in this  action, e.g., members of Class Two, were \nsubjected to a strip search, a visual cavity se arch and compulsory delousing prior to being \narraigned before a Judge or provided with any judicial process to contest their detentions.  \n32.  Many of the pre-trial detainees in this  action, e.g., m embers of Class Two, are  \ntaken into the custody of the WVRJA immediately after their arrest before appearing in Court to \nbe arraigned.  This often occurs during the even ing and on weekends, or for individuals arrested \nin rural areas.  Generally, th ese individuals are arraigned  by videoconference several hours \nand/or days after being taken into the custody of the WVRJA.    \n33.  Specifically, the WVRJA and the I ndividual Defendants’ written policies do not \nspecifically  require  that  individuals who are to be stri p  searched and deloused should be  \narraigned first prior to being strip searched and deloused.  This procedure, however, is conducted \ncontemporaneously with receiving the jail uni form.  According to de position testimony from \nemployees of the WVRJA, detainees are usually photographed prior to being arraigned, and are \nalways photographed prior to arraignm ent when they committed directly to the WVRJA after \narrest. \n  12\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 89   Filed 09/14/12   Page 13 of 25 PageID #: 871\n34.  In deposition testimony, the Rule 30(b)(6) deponent of the WVRJA admitted that \nthree facilities, the Tygart Valley Regional Ja il, the Potomac Highlands Regional Jail and the  \nCentral Regional Jail universally photographed pre-trial detainees in the WVRJA jail uniform.   \n35.  The WVRJA and the I ndividual Defendants instituted a written and/or de facto \npolicy, custom or practice of strip searching all pre-trial detainees at the WVRJA without regard \nto  whether or not they had b een  arraigned, and consequently  strip  searched and deloused \nthousands of individuals prior to their seeing a j udicial officer to contest their detention.  Many \nof these individuals, such as Plaintiff Floyd Teter, were released on their own recognizance after \narraignment.  Others made bail in short order after being arraigned.        \n36.  The WVRJA and the I ndividual Defendants have instituted a written and/or  de \nfacto policy, custom or practice of  delousing all individuals who  enter the custody of the W est \nVirginia Regional Jail System, regardless of the indi vidual characteristics or the nature of their \ncharged crime.  The delousing procedure first entails a detainee completely disrobing in front of \na correction officer.  T he correction officer then  sprays delousing solu tion upon a detainee’s \nnaked body.  Finally, the detainee is ordered to shower within full view of the corrections officer.  \nThe delousing procedure is conducted upon all detainees without inquiry into or establishment of \nreasonable suspicion, or inquiry or establishment into whether the detainee actually harbors lice.  \nThis delousing is com pulsory, in that a correction officer s tands before a detainee and sprays \nthem with a plastic spray bottl e, and then observes them  rubbing the solution into their hair, \nincluding their pubic hair.  This  delousing occurs in the absen ce of any medical evaluation to \ndetermine the presence, or absence, of lice.  \n  13\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 89   Filed 09/14/12   Page 14 of 25 PageID #: 872\n37.  Upon information and belief, the presen ce of lice in the W VRJA facilities is \nlimited,  and  the on e-time  application of   “liceall,”  in  the  absence  of any further m edical \ntreatment, is not an effective cure for lice.   \n38.  Upon information and belief, the “liceall” solution used by the WVRJA is caustic, \nin that can, and often does, cause chem ical burns to those upon whom it  is applied, especially \nAfrican-Americans.   \n39.  Upon information and belief, Corrections Officers of the WVRJA do not receive \nany medical training prior to apply ing “liceall” to the faces, genitals, and rectums of pre-trial \ndetainees.   \n40.  The WVRJA and the I ndividual Defendants know that they m ay not institute, \nenforce  or perm it  enforcement  of a policy  or  practice of conducting delousing without \nparticularized, reasonable suspicion that the detainee was harboring lice.   \n41.  The Defendants’ written and/or  de facto policy, practice and custom mandating \nwholesale  delousing of all m isdemeanor  and  violation  arrestees has been prom ulgated, \neffectuated and/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly established law. \n42.  The  WVRJA  and Director Miller have   promulgated,  implemented,  enforced, \nand/or failed to rectify a written and/or  de facto policy, practice or cust om of delousing all \nindividuals placed into the custody  of the  West Virginia Regional Jail System  without any \nrequirement of reasonable suspicion, or indeed suspicion of any sort.  This writte n and/or de \nfacto policy made the delousing of  pre-trial detainees routine;  whether or not a detainee was \nactually harboring lice, or was suspected to harbor lice, was not relevant to the WVRJA’s policy, \npractice and custom of compulsory delousing.   \n  14\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 89   Filed 09/14/12   Page 15 of 25 PageID #: 873\n43.  .   \n44.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search conducted pursuant \nto this written and/or de facto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip searches and delousing -- \neach member of the proposed classes, including the named Plaintiffs -- has suffered or will suffer \npsychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiff Michael Cantley \n45.  Plaintiff Cantley is an adult male residing in Cabell County, West Virginia.  On or \nabout September 28, 2008 he was arrested on non- felony charges of violating an order of \nprotection at the home of his ex-wife.  Specifically, Mr. Cantley was required to stay away from \nhis former wife’s home, and failed to do so on the date in question.  The allegations against Mr. \nCantley did not involve a claim  that he had harmed his wife, or  anyone else, but rather that he \nwas present in a location at which he was forbidden to be present.    Plaintiff Cantley’s arrest was \nvoid of any reasonable suspicion that he harbored any weapons, contraband, or lice. \n46.  Mr. Cantley was first taken in custody by the West Virginia State Police, and later \nthat evening taken to the W estern Regional Jail.  Plaintiff Cantley was initially housed in a  \nholding cell.  \n47.  After being housed in a holding cell for  several hours, Plaintiff Cantley was \nrequired to undergo a strip search. \n48.  Plaintiff Cantley was brought into a shower room  and advised by a correctional \nofficer that he would be strip searched.  In connection with the strip search, Plaintiff Cantley was \nrequired to completely disrobe, lift his arms and legs, spread his butt cheeks, lift up his testicles \nand bend over, so that he could be inspected by a correctional officer.  Plaintiff Cantley was then \n  15\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 89   Filed 09/14/12   Page 16 of 25 PageID #: 874\nsprayed with de-lousing solution and ordered to  shower while the corrections officer had a \ncomplete view of him showering.  He was then issued prison clothing. \n49.  Plaintiff  Cantley  was released from th e  Western  Regional Jail on or about \nNovember 6, 2008, and all charges were dismissed.   \n50.  Plaintiff Cantley was a dmitted to the W estern Regional Jail on other occasions \nduring the class period, and was strip searched a nd deloused prior to being arraigned before a  \njudicial officer.  \n51.  Mr. Cantley has also been adm itted the Western Regional Jail on seve ral other \noccasions during the class period f or misdemeanor or other minor charges, and underwent  \nprocedures  similar,  in all m aterial  ways, to those detaile d  in this Am ended  Class Action \nComplaint.   Upon inform ation  and belief, thes e  arrests were also voi d  of any reasonable \nsuspicion to believe that he possessed weapons or contraband in his private areas, or lice.  \n52.  As a direct and proximate result of these unlawful strip searches, Plaintiff Cantley \nhas  suffered  and continues to suf fer  psychological  pain,  humiliation,  suffering  and m ental \nanguish. \n \nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiff Floyd Teter \n53.  Plaintiff Teter is an adult male residing in Preston County, West Virginia.  On or \nabout February 19, 2010, he was arrested by an of ficer of the Terra Alta Police Departm ent on \nnon-felony charges of putting materials on a highway and obstructing an officer.   \n  16\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 89   Filed 09/14/12   Page 17 of 25 PageID #: 875\n54.  Specifically, Mr. Teter was on a tractor moving snow in the vicinity of a road, and \nwas arrested in a Church parking lo t after driving his tractor there.  Plaintiff Teter’s arrest was \nvoid of any reasonable suspicion that he harbored any weapons, contraband, or lice. \n55.  Mr. Teter was first taken into custody by the Terra Alta Police Department to the \nPreston Memorial Hospital to treat injuries to his back.  After being rel eased from the hospital, \nhe was transported to the Preston County Sher iff’s Department, and later transported by the \nPreston  County Sheriff’s Department Transport  Office  to  the Tygart  Valley  Regional Jail.   \nPlaintiff Teter was initially housed in a holding cell.  \n56.  After being housed in a holding cell for se veral hours, and prior to arraignm ent, \nPlaintiff Teter was required to undergo a strip search. \n57.  Plaintiff Teter was brought into a show er room and advised by a correctional \nofficer that he would be strip se arched.  In connection with the strip search, Plaintiff Teter was \nrequired to completely disrobe, lift his arms and legs, spread his butt cheeks, lift up his testicles \nand bend over, so that he could be inspected by  a correctional officer.  Plaintiff Teter was th en \nsprayed with de-lousing solution and ordered to  shower while the corrections officer had a \ncomplete view of him showering.  He was then issued prison clothing. \n58.  Plaintiff Teter was released from the Western Regional Jail on or about February \n20, 2011 shortly after being arraigned.   \n59.  As a direct and proximate result of this unlawful strip search, Plaintiff Teter has \nsuffered and continues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \n \n \n \n  17\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 89   Filed 09/14/12   Page 18 of 25 PageID #: 876\nCAUSES OF ACTION \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST THE INDIVDIUAL DEFENDANTS  IN  \nTHEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES \n \n-- Violation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law --  \n-- Illegal Strip and Visual Cavity Searches -- \n \n60.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and realleges each and every allegation stated \nin the foregoing paragraphs. \n61.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects citizens from \nunreasonable searches by law enforcement officers, and prohibits officers from conducting strip \nsearches and delousing of indi viduals arrested for m isdemeanors or violations absent som e \nparticularized suspicion that the individual in question has eith er contraband or weapons when \nthose  detainees have not been provided with a ppropriate  judicial pro cess  to contes t  their \ndetention. \n62.  The Fourth Amendment of the United St ates Constitution also protects citizens \nfrom unreasonable searches and seizures by law  enforcement officers, and prohibits officers \nfrom conducting uniform delousing of individuals arrested for misdemeanors or violations absent \nsome particularized suspicion that the individual in question is  harboring lice on  their bodies.  \nThis is especially so when the delousing regimen in question will not actually cure someone who \nis infested with lice.      \n63.  The actions of the Individual Defendants detailed above violated Plaintiffs’ rights \nunder the United States Constituti on.  It was not objectively r easonable  for West  Virginia \nRegional Jail personnel to strip  search and delouse the Plainti ffs and Class Members based on \ntheir arrests for misdemeanor/ summary violation charges when they were not provided with \n  18\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 89   Filed 09/14/12   Page 19 of 25 PageID #: 877\njudicial process to contest their detention an d seek bail.  Additiona lly, it was not objectively \nreasonable for West Virginia Regional Jail pers onnel to delouse all pre-trial detainees charged \nwith misdemeanors/summary violation charges in  the absence of any m edical inspection or \nsuspicion that the detainee’s body was harboring lice.  It was also not objectively reasonable for  \nthe  Individual Defendants to or der/direct  West Virginia Re gional  Jail System   personnel to \nconduct such searches.   \n64.  These strip searches and delousing were conducted pursuant to the policy, custom \nor practice of the Individual Defendants.  As su ch, the Individual Defendants are directly liable \nfor the damages of Plaintiffs and members of the Class. \n65.  Upon  information  and belief, the Indivi dual  Defendants are responsible for \nestablishing the policies and procedures to be  utilized in the opera tion of the West Virgin ia \nRegional  Jail system ,  and are re sponsible  for the im plementation  of the strip search and \ndelousing  policies questioned in this lawsu it.   As   such, the Individual Defendants are \nindividually responsible for the damages of the Plaintiffs and Members of the Class.    \n66.  The Policy Making Defendants knew that th e Jail’s strip search and delousing \npolicies were illegal, and acted willfully, knowingly, and with specific intent to deprive Plaintiffs \nand Members of the Class of their Constitutional rights. \n67.  This conduct on the part of all Individual  Defendants represents a violation of 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983, given that their actions were taken under color of state law. \n68.  As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above,  \nPlaintiffs and the Members of the Class have been irreparably injured. \n \n  19\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 89   Filed 09/14/12   Page 20 of 25 PageID #: 878\n \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST THE INDIVDIUAL DEFENDANTS IN  \nTHEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES \n \n-- Violation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law --  \n-- The Right to Privacy – \n \n69.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and realleges each and every allegation stated \nin the foregoing paragraphs. \n70.  The  right to privacy is protected by th e  Fourth Am endment  and is also an \nindependent right with other constitutional underpinnings. \n71.  The right to privacy prohibits officers from conducting delousing of individuals \narrested for misdemeanors or violations absent some particularized suspicion that the individual \nin question has lice. \n72.  The actions of the Individual Defendants  detailed above violated and improperly \ninvaded Plaintiffs’ right to privacy.  It was not objectively reasonable for West Virginia Regional \nJail  personnel  to delo use  the  Plaintiffs  and Class Members based on their arrests for \nmisdemeanor/summary  violation  charges.   It was also n ot  objectively  reasonable for the \nIndividual Defendant to order/direct West Virginia Regional Jail System personnel to conduct \nsuch a procedure.   \n73.  This delousing was conducte d pursuant to the  policy, custom or practice of the \nIndividual Defendants.  As such, the Individual Defendants are directly liable for the damages of \nPlaintiffs and members of the Class. \n74.  Upon  information  and belief, the Indivi dual  Defendants are responsible for \nestablishing the policies and procedures to be  utilized in the opera tion of the West Virgin ia \nRegional  Jail system,  and are re sponsible  for  the implementation  of the delousing policies \n  20\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 89   Filed 09/14/12   Page 21 of 25 PageID #: 879\nquestioned in this lawsuit.  As such, the Indi vidual Defendants are individually responsible for \nthe damages of the Plaintiffs and Members of the Class.    \n75.  The  Policy Making D efendants  knew that  the  Jail’s delousing policies were \nillegal,  and acted willfully, knowingly, and with  specific  intent to de prive  Plaintiffs and \nMembers of the Class of their Constitutional rights. \n76.  This conduct on the part of the Individual Defendants represents a violation of 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983, given that their actions were taken under color of state law. \n77.

Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and realleges each and every allegation stated \nin the foregoing paragraphs. \n79.  The policy, custom and practice of the WVRJA and the Individual Defendants are \nclearly unconstitutional and violates the right to privacy, in that these entities and individuals are \ndirecting/conducting the strip sear ches and delousing of all individuals placed into the W est \nVirginia  Regional Jail System   without any partic ularized  suspicion that   the individuals in \nquestion have either contraband or weapons. \n  21\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 89   Filed 09/14/12   Page 22 of 25 PageID #: 880\n80.  Plaintiffs and Members of the Class reque st that this Court issue a declaratory \njudgment, and that it declare  the strip search and delousing  policies of the W VRJA and the \nIndividual Defendants to be unconstitutional and violative of the right to privacy. \n \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS  \n-- Demand for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction -- \n81.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and realleges each and every allegation stated \nin the foregoing paragraphs. \n82.  The policy, custom and practice of the WVRJA and the Individual Defendants is \nclearly unconstitutional and violative of the right to privacy, in that these entities and individuals \nare directing/conducting the strip searches and delousing of all individuals placed into the West \nVirginia  Regional Jail system   without any partic ularized  suspicion that   the individuals in \nquestion have either contraband, weapons, or lice. \n83.  Upon information and belief, this policy is currently in place in the West Virginia \nRegional Jail System, with new and/or prospective Members of the Class being subjected to th e \nharms that have already been inflicted upon the Plaintiffs.   \n84.  The continuing pattern of strip searching  and delousing individuals charged with \nminor crimes will cause irreparable harm to the new and/or prospective Members of the Class, an \nadequate remedy for which does not exist at law. \n85.  Plaintiffs  demand  that the W VRJA,  Director  Miller,  and  the W est  Virginia \nRegional  Jail System personnel immediately de sist  from  strip searching and delousing \nindividuals  placed into   the custod y  of the We st  Virginia Regional J ail  System  absent any  \n  22\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 89   Filed 09/14/12   Page 23 of 25 PageID #: 881\nparticularized suspicion that the individuals in question have either contraband, weapons, or lice, \nand seeks both a preliminary and permanent injunction from this Court ordering as much. \n \nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY \n86.

A declaratory judgment against all Defendants declaring the WVRJA and the \nIndividual Defendants’ policy, practice and custom of strip and visual cavity searching, and \ndelousing, of all detainees entering the West Virginia Regional Jail System, regardless of the \ncrime charged or suspicion of contraband or lice, to be unconstitutional, violative of the right to \nprivacy and otherwise improper. \n  23\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 89   Filed 09/14/12   Page 24 of 25 PageID #: 882\n4.

Miller, Joseph A. DeLong, and Larry Parsons, all in their individua l and official\ncapacities as the Executive Directors of the WVRJA. ECF No. 95.  For the following reasons, the\nCourt DENIES the motion.\n\nI.\nFACTUAL AND \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\nThis action was filed on July 1, 2009, by Planitiff Michael Cantley, individually and\non behalf of a Class of others similarly situated, against the WVRJA and Mr. Miller.  In his First\nAmended Class Action Complaint filed on October 9, 2009, Plaintiff asserted he was arrested on or\nabout September 28, 2008, on non-felony charges and was required to undergo a visual cavity strip\nsearch (vcs)1 and delousing pursuant to a W VRJA policy.  Plaintiff Cantley claim ed that the\nWVRJA policy of strip searching and delousing pretrial detainees charged with misdemeanors or\nother minor crimes is unconstitutional under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983.\nDefendants WVRJA and Mr. Miller filed a motion to dismiss.  On August 5, 2010,\nthe Court denied the motion. Cantley v. W. Va. Reg’l Jail and Corr. Fac. Auth,. 728 F. Supp.2d 803\n(S.D. W. Va. 2010).  Discovery proceeded in this case until June 1, 2011, when the Court signed the\nparties’ proposed stipulation to stay further proceedings in this matter until after the United States\nSupreme Court issued a decision in Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders, another strip search\ncase.  The Supreme Court issued its decision on A pril 2, 2012.  Florence v. Board of Chosen\nFreeholders, 132 S. Ct. 1510 (2012).  In the interim period, the Court permitted Floyd Teter to be\n1“A ‘strip search,’ though an umbrella term, generally refers to an inspection of a naked\nindividual, without any scrutiny of the subjecst' body cavities.  A ‘visual body cavity search’ extends\nto visual inspection of the anal and genital areas.  A ‘manual body cavity search’ includes some\ndegree of touching or probing of body cavities.”B lackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556, 561 n. 3 (1st Cir.\n1985) (citation omitted). \n2\n\nadded as a class representative in a Second Amended Complaint. ECF Nos. 65 & 66.  Mr. Teter also\nalleges that he was arrested on non-felony charges,s ubjected to a visual cavity search, and sprayed\nwith a delousing solution prior to being arraigned.\nIn light of the Supreme Court’s decision in Florence, the Court permitted Plaintiffs\nto amend and file a Third Amended Complaint, in which Defendants DeLong and Parsons were\nadded. ECF No. 89.  The Court also entered a newS cheduling Order.  Thereafter, Defendants filed\nthe current motion to dismiss the Third Amended Complaint.\n  II.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\nIn Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007), the United States Supreme\nCourt disavowed the “no set of facts” language found in  Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41 (1957),\nwhich was long used to evaluate complaints subject to 12(b)(6) motions. 550 U.S. at 563.  In its\nplace, courts must now look for “plausibility” in the complaint.  This standard requires a plaintiff\nto set forth the “grounds” for an “entitle[m ent] to relief” that is m ore than mere “labels and\nconclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.” Id. at 555\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  Accepting the factual allegations in the complaint\nas true (even when doubtful), the allegations “must be enough to raise a right to relief above the\nspeculative level . . . .” Id. (citations omitted).  If the allegations in the complaint, assuming their\ntruth, do “not raise a claim of entitlement to relief, this basic deficiency should . . . be exposed at the\npoint of minimum expenditure of time and money by the parties and the court.” Id. at 558 (internal\nquotation marks and citations omitted).  \n3\n\nIn Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009), the Suprem e Court explained the\nrequirements of Rule 8 and the “plausibility standard” in more detail.  In Iqbal, the Supreme Court\nreiterated that Rule 8 does not demand “detailed factual allegations[.]” 556 U.S. at 678 (i nternal\nquotation marks and citations omitted).  However, a mere “unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-\nharmed-me accusation” is insufficient.  Id.  “To survive a m otion to dismiss, a complaint must\ncontain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its\nface.’” Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570).  Facial plausibility exists when a claim contains\n“factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable\nfor the misconduct alleged.” Id. (citation omitted).  The Supreme Court continued by explaining that,\nalthough factual allegations in a complaint must be accepted as true for purposes of a motion to\ndismiss, this tenet does not apply to legal conclusions. Id.  “Threadbare recitals of the elements of\na cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.” Id. (citation omitted). \nWhether a plausible claim is stated in a complaint requires a court to conduct a context-specific\nanalysis, drawing upon the court’s own judicial experience and common sense. Id. at 679.  If the\ncourt finds from its analysis that “the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than\nthe mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged-but it has not  ‘show[n]’-‘that the\npleader is entitled to relief.’” Id. (quoting, in part, Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).  The Suprem e Court\nfurther articulated that “a court considering a motion to dismiss can choose to begin by identifying\npleadings that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth. \nWhile legal conclusions can provide the fram ework of a complaint, they must be supported by\nfactual allegations.” Id.\n4\n\nIII.\nDISCUSSION\nIn Florence, the Supreme Court was asked to decide whether all detainees who are\nadmitted to the general jail2 population may be required to undress and subm it to a close visual\ninspection. 132 S. Ct. at 1513.  The case before it nivolved Albert W. Florence who was arrested on\nan outstanding warrant, which inexplicitly remained in a computer database despite the fact the\nunderlying reason for the warrant was resolved. Id. at 1514.  Upon his arrest, Mr. Florence was\nconfined at the Burlington County Detent ion Center in New Jersey for six days and then was\ntransferred to the Essex County Correctional Facility. Id.  \nPursuant to the procedures at the Burlnigton County jail, every arrestee was required\n“to shower with a delousing agent.” Id.  As an arrestee disrobed, officers also would examine the \nindividual “for scars, marks, gang tattoos, and contraband[.]” Id.  Mr. Florence further claimed he\nwas directed “to open his m outh, lift his tongue , hold out his arm s, turn around, and lift his\ngenitals[,]” although it was not clear whether these requirements were normal practice. Id. (citations\nomitted).  During his detention, Mr. Fl orence “shared a cell with at least one other person and\ninteracted with other inmates[.]” Id. at 1513.\nSimilarly, when Mr. Florence was transf erred to the Essex County Correctional\nFacility, he was placed in a holding cell, instructed to disrobe, and subjected to a visual inspection\n“for body markings, wounds, and contraband” and “ano fficer looked at their ears, nose, mouth, hair,\n2The Supreme Court used a broad meaning of the word “jail” to include prisons and detention\nfacilities. Id.\n5\n\nscalp, fingers, hands, arms, armpits, and other body openings” without touching him. Id. at 1514\n(citation omitted).  “This policy applied regardless of the circumstances of the arrest, the suspected\noffense, or the detainee’s behavior, demeanor, or criminal history.” Id.  Mr. Florence then was\nrequired to shower (while his clothes were inspected) and, thereafter, he was admitted to the Essex\nfacility.  Mr. Florence was released the following day, after the charges were dismissed. Id.   \nMr. Florence brought an action challenging the policy requiring c lose visual\ninspections of those arrested of m inor offenses, without any reason to believe the arrestee was\nharboring weapons, drugs, or contraband. Id. at 1514-15.  The district court certified a class and,\nafter discovery, ruled on summary judgment that the policy violated the Fourth Amendment. Id. at\n1515.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, finding the procedure\n“struck a reasonable balance between inmate privacy and the security needs of the two jails.” Id.\n(citation omitted).  The Third Circuit premised its finding that the searches occurred prior to an\narrestee’s admission into the general population, and Mr. Florence did not dispute this premise. Id.\nIn ruling on the constitutionality of thep olicy, the Supreme Court acknowledged the\ndifficulties in operating and maintaining safety in detention facilities, which “requires the expertise\nof correctional officials, who must have substantial discretion to devise reasonable solutions to the\nproblems they face.” Id. (citation omitted).  The Supreme Court emphasized its position of giving \ndeference to correctional authorities and upholdingr egulations that impinge upon the constitutional\nrights of inmates if they are “‘reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.’” Id. (quoting\nTurner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89 (1987) (other citations omitted)).  In addition, the Supreme Court \n6\n\nrecognized there is no m echanical test to determine the reasonableness of an intrusion into an\ninmate’s privacy. Id. at 1516 (citing Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979)).  Rather, “[t]he need\nfor a particular search must be balanced against the resulting invasion of personal rights.”I d. (citing\nBell, 441 U.S. at 559).  \nUtilizing this balancing test, the Supreme Court upheld “[p]olicies designed to keep\ncontraband out of jails and prisons[.]”I d. (citing Block v. Rutherford, 468 U.S. 576 (1984) (banning\ncontact visits); Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517 (1984) (upholding random searches of inmates’\nlockers and cells)).  “These cases establish that correctional officials must be permitted to devise\nreasonable search policies to detect and detert he possession of contraband in their facilities.” Id. at\n1517 (citation omitted).  In addition, the reasonableness of a policy, when juxtaposed to legitimate\nsecurity concerns, lies within the realm and expertise of those officials.  Further, the Supreme Court\nrepeatedly admonished that “in the absence of substantial evidence in the record to indicate that the\nofficials have exaggerated their response to these considerations courts should ordinarily defer to\ntheir expert judgment in such matters.” Id. (citations omitted).\nApplying this standard, the Supreme Court stated that admitting new detainees to the\ninmate population creates numerous risks to staff, other inmates, and the new detainee. Id. at 1518.\nThus, given that f acilities “are often crowded, unsanitary, and dangerous places,” there is a\nsignificant interest on the part of correctional foficials to conduct a thoroughs earch during the intake\nprocess. Id. at 1520.  Specificall y, the Court stated that “[t]he danger of introducing lice or\ncontagious infections, for example, is well documented.” Id. at 1518 (citations omitted).  Likewise,\n7\n\nthe  Court noted that visually inspecting tatt oos  to identif y  gang af filiation  is a reasonable\nrequirement during the intake process to protect everyone at the facility. Id. at 1519.  Moreover,\nscreening for contraband during intake is the most serious duty officials have, and some inmates\nwho may be believed to be the lowest risk area ctually dangerous criminals and are caught bringing\ncontraband into jail. Id. at 1519-20.  The Court noted that,  not only do those arrested for minor\noffenses have the same incentive to conceal contraband, but they may be coerced to hide contraband\nif it is known they are not subject to the sam e searches as others.  Therefore, to carve out an\nexception to a standard search protocol for those rarested for minor offenses opens the door for those\narrestees to being asked or coerced into bringingc ontraband into the facilities because it will be well\nknown they will not be searched. Id. at 1520-21.\nIn addition, the Court recognized that, practically speaking, it m ay be difficult to\nmake inmate classifications based upon current and prior offenses before an intake se arch is\nconducted.  Id. at 1521.  Moreover, in the case before it, cirminal history records were not available\nto the intake officers conducting searches and, even if they were available, they may be inaccurate\nor incomplete. Id. (citations omitted).  Without reliable information about the arrestees’ records, the\nCourt found “it would be illogical to require officers to assume the arrestees in front of them do not\npose a risk of smuggling something into the facility.” Id.  Furthermore, even if reliable records are\navailable, requiring officers to make quick decisions on whether the arrestee’s record requires a\nsearch raises serious difficulties with implementation and opens the door to potential charges of\ndiscrimination. Id. at 1521-22 (citation om itted).  Therefore, for all of these reasons, the Court\naffirmed the Third Circuit’s decision finding the procedure was a reasonable balance between the\n8\n\nneed for security and inmate privacy. Id. at 1523.  In doing so, the Court specifically stated it was\nnot ruling on a situation in which the arrestee’s detnetion had “not yet been reviewed by a magistrate\nor other judicial officer, and who can be held in available f acilities removed from the general\npopulation[.]” Id. at 1523.  In addition, in their concurrnig opinions, both Chief Justice Roberts and\nJustice Alito emphasized that the Court was not foreclosing the possibility of an exception when a\ndetainee has been arrested for a minor offense, the detention has not yet been reviewed by a judicial\nofficer, and the detainee may be placed in an a lternative facility away from the general inmate\npopulation. Id. at 1523-24.\nIn response to the Florence decision, Plaintiffs in the present case filed their Third\nAmended Class Action Complaint in an attempt to conform their claims to the holding inF  lorence. \nPlaintiffs allege the WVRJA has a blanket policyr equiring all pretrial detainees, who have not been\nbefore a judicial officer, be strip searched, deloused, and placed in jail clothing regardless of their\noffense. TAC, at 2.  Specifically, Plaintfif Michael Cantley asserts hew  as arrested on September 28,\n2008, on non-felony charges of violating a domestic violence protection order.  Plaintiff Cantley\nstates he was at his former wife’s house in violation of the order, but he did not harm her or anyone\nelse while there.  Plaintiff was arrested, taken into custody, and placed  in a holding cell at the\nWestern Regional Jail.\n9\n\nPlaintiff Cantley claims that, after several hours of custody in a holding cell, he was\nrequired to undergo a “strip search” 3  and delousing pursuant to a W VRJA policy.  Alt hough\nPlaintiff Cantley claims his arrest was void of any reasonable suspicion he possessed any weapons\nor contraband or harbored lice, the policy required him  to completely disrobe in front of a\ncorrectional officer for a visual inspection.  During the inspection, Plaintiff Cantley had to lift his\narms and legs, spread his butt cheeks, lift up his testicles and bend at the waist.  The correctional\nofficer then sprayed a delousing solution on him and required him to shower in view of the officer. \nPlaintiff Cantley was then issued prison clothing, and he remained incarcerated for over a month,\nuntil on or about November 6, 2008, when all charges against him were dismissed. \nPlaintiff Teter was arrested on February 19, 2010, “on non-felony charges of putting\nmaterials on a highway and obstructing an officer.”I d. at ¶53.  According to Plaintiff Teter, he was\narrested after using “a tractor moving snow in the vicinity of a road, and was arrested in a Church\nparking lot after driving his tractor there.” Id. at ¶54.  Like Plaintiff Cantley, he asserts “his arrest\nwas void of any reasonable suspicion that he harbored any weapons, contraband, or lice.”I d.  After\nhis arrest, Plaintiff Teter was treated for back injuries at a hospital and then ultimately placed in a\nholding cell at the Tygart Valley Regional Jail. Id. at ¶55.  Plaintiff Teter claims he was held in the\nholding cell for several hours and then strip s earched, sprayed with the delousing solution, and\n3In their Third Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs define their use of the phrase “strip search”\nto include a vc s and a requirement that the detainees “m anipulate body parts to allow for an\ninspection of these private areas.” Id. at ¶29.  In addition, Plaintiffs claim that “some members of\nthe Proposed Class (not including the  Plaintiffs) are also required to undergo physical cavity\nsearches upon entry to the custody of the WVRJA, where a Correctional Officer inserts a gloved\nfinger into the rectum of a detainee to search for contraband.” Id. at ¶30.\n10\n\nrequired to shower prior to being arraigned.  He describes his strip search as being identical to that\nof Plaintiff Cantley.  Plaintiff Teter states he was released from custody the next day on his own\nrecognizance, shortly after being arraigned.4\nWith respect to delousing, Plaintiffs cl aim that correctional officers receive no\nmedical training in applying the delousing solution and the policy is enforced without any medical\nevaluation to determine if lice are present.  Based upon inform ation and belief, Plaintiff further\nasserts that the WVJRA uses “Liceall,” which Plaintiff alleges is a caustic solution that can, and\noften does, cause chemical burns, especially when applied to African-Americans.  However, neither\nPlaintiff Cantley nor Plaintiff Teter claim they personally suffered any chemical burns.  In addition,\nPlaintiffs assert that a one-time treatment with Liceall, without further medical care, is ineffective\nas a cure for lice. \nPlaintiffs argue the strip search policy as applied to pretrial detainees charged with\nmisdemeanors or other minor crimes, absent some particularized suspicion, and prior to j udicial\nprocess to contest their detention violates theF ourth Amendment and 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  In addition,\nthey assert that the delousing policy as applied t aoll detainees charged with misdemeanors and other\nminor crimes, irrespective of whether they were arraigned, violates the Fourth Am endment and\n§ 1983.  As a result of these policies, Plainti ffs claim to have suffered psychological pain,\nhumiliation, suffering, and mental anguish.  Although Plaintiffs’ first and second causes of actions\n4Plaintiff Teter actually states he was arrested on February 19, 2010, and released after his\narraignment on February 20, 2011.  The Court believest hat one of the years is a typographical error\ngiven that it is unlikely his arraignment occurred over a year after his arrest.\n11\n\nare labeled as being “against the individual Defendants in their individual capacities,” Plaintiffs’\nPrayer for Relief only seeks “judgm ent against Director Miller in his individua l capacity, on\nPlaintiffs’ First and Second Causes of Action . . ., awarding compensatory damages to Plaintiffs and\neach Member of the Proposed Class . . . .”T AC, at 23 ¶2.  In addition, Plaintiffs seek declaratory and\ninjunctive relief against all Defendants that the policies are unconstitutional and violates their right\nto privacy.  On the other hand, Defendants contend that the strip search policy and the delousing\nprocedures are necessary for safety and healthr easons.  Thus, Defendants argue the policies are not\nconstitutionally defective and, in any event, they are entitled to qualified immunity.\nDefendants assert they are entitled to qualified immunity on the strip search issue\nbecause their conduct did “not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which\na reasonable person would have known.”  Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 609 (1999) (quoting\nHarlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982)).  Under the dotcrine of qualified immunity, a court\nfirst asks: “Taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, do the facts alleged\nshow the officer’s conduct violated a constitutional right? ” Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201\n(2001).  If the answer is no, the inquiry ends. Id. On the other hand, if the answer is yes, then the\nCourt must decide if it was a clearly established right within the context of the case. Id.5\nConsidering the factual allegations in theT  hird Amended Complaint in the light most\nfavorable to Plaintiffs in this case, the Court shall assume (without deciding) that both Plaintiffs\n5The order of the two-step protocol is no longer mandatory, but it often will be conducted\nin this order. Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223 (2009) (overruling Saucier).\n12\n\nwere arrested for minor crimes and strip searched and subject to delousing prior to appearing before\na judicial officer without any reasonable suspicionth at either harbored contraband, weapons, or lice. \nThe problem in this case in deciding the first question under Saucier, however, is that there is no\nmention in the Third Amended Complaint as to whether or not either Plaintiff was in close contact\nwith other detainees or inmates or admitted into the general population of the facility and, if so, were\nthere any reasonable alternatives to such placement.  Clearly, under Florence, a detainee’s access\nand contact to other inm ates is an important factor for this Court to consider in weighing the\nreasonableness of Defendants’ actions against Plaintiffs’ rights.  Therefore, at this point, the Court\nsimply does not have sufficient inform ation to rule on whether Defendants’ conduct viol ated a\nconstitutional right. See Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201.\nDefendants argue, however, that even if Plaintiffs were released from custody prior\nto being placed in a general housing unit, the Supreme Court in Florence made it clear it was not\ndeciding whether a strip search under those circ umstances would be reasonable.  Therefore,\nDefendants insist they did not violate any “clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of\nwhich a reasonable person woul d have known” and , therefore, they are entitled to im munity.\nWilson, 526 U.S. at 609 (citation omitted). \nAlthough it is true Florence did not rule on this precise issue, the Fourth Circuit\nestablished long ago that it is unconstitutional to have an indiscriminate policy of strip searching a\ndetainee who was not intermingled into the general population, who did not com mit an offense\ncommonly associated with possession of a weapon or contraband, who gave no reason to believe\n13\n\nshe possessed a weapon or contraband, and who was detained for a short amount of time prior to\nrelease. Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007, 1013 (4th Cir. 1981).6  The Supreme Court in Florence\nvery specifically stated it was not ruling on the erasonableness of searches where a detainee was not\nassigned to the general inmate population or in substantial contact with other detainees. 132 S. Ct.\nat 1523.  As mentioned above, this limitation in Florence was echoed by Chief Justice Roberts and\nJustice Alito in their separate concurring opinions.  Clearly, the Supreme Court left the door open\nto the possibility of finding a constitutional violtaion under these more narrow circumstances.  Thus,\nas Florence did not overrule the Fourth Circuit’s decision inL ogan in this regard, it remains clearly\nestablished within the Fourth  Circuit that such searches are unconstitutional.  Assum ing these\nlimited facts, the decision in Florence does nothing to change t he legal landscape in the Fourth\nCircuit.  Therefore, at this point, Defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity with respect to\nthe strip search and the Court DENIES Defendants’ motion with respect to the strip search claims.\nCompare Jones v. Murphy, Civil No. CCB-05-1287, 2013 WL 822372, *6 (D. Md. Mar. 5, 2013)\n(granting immunity to individual defendant wardens on the grounds that Florence overruled some\naspects of Fourth Circuit law and “left the cont ours of any ‘exception’ that would apply to the\nplaintiffs in this case unclear and open to debate”).\nTurning  next to the delousing issue, this Court fully explained i n  its  earlier\nMemorandum Opinion and Order that whether or  not the delousing policy violated Plaintiffs’\nconstitutional rights is a matter upon which the Court will withhold judgment until after Defendants\n6This Court fully discussed the holding in Logan in its decision resolving Defendants’ first\nmotion to dismiss. Cantley v. W. Va. Reg’l Jail and Corr. Auth., 728 F. Supp.2d at 809-815.\n14\n\nare “given the opportunity to present evidence and arguments justifying the delousing policy on its\nown merits.” Cantley, 728 F. Supp.2d at 817.  Defendants neverhteless argue they should be granted\nqualified immunity on this issue because they did not violate any “clearly established statutory or\nconstitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.”  Wilson, 526 U.S. at 609\n(citation omitted).  \nAgain, the Court finds that, under the particula rcircumstances of this case, this issue\nis one best resolved after discovery because there are numerous scenarios that may warrant or not\nwarrant immunity.  As stated in dicta in  Florence, “[t]he danger of introducing lice . . . is well\ndocumented.” 132 S. Ct. at 1518 (citations omitted).  Thus, it is conceivable that immunity may be\nappropriate if detainees entering the general inmate population, or who are in close contact with\nother detainees, are subject to delousing to prevent a potential outbreak.  On the other hand, a court\nmay decide that a reasonable official would not believe it is constitutional to have a detainee remove\nhis clothes and get sprayed with a delousing soluotin when that detainee has no indications of having\nlice, is never integrated with other detainees or in the general inmate population, and is released\nfrom custody within a few hours.S ee Amaechi v. West, 237 F.3d 356, 362-63 (4th Cir. 2001) (stating\nthat the concept of “clearly established” includes those rights previously adjudicated and “those\nmanifestly included within more general applications of the core constitutional principle invoked”\nwhich would provide notice to a reasonable person in the official’s position that certain conduct\nviolates those rights (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)).  The Court is not indicating\nhow it would rule on these different scenarios, but it is m erely demonstrating the breath of\n15\n\npossibilities and how it may impact whether a reasonable person in Defendants’ position would\nbelieve the conduct violated the constitutional rights of the detainee.  \nIn the instant case, the Court simply does not know whether either named Plaintiff\nwas integrated with other inmates or what specific justifications Defendants may have for the policy. \nAlthough the Court is mindful that decisions on immunity ordinarily should be decided early in\nlitigation,7 the Court does not have enough information at this point to rule on the issue and finds\na decision would be premature.  Moreover, even if the Court would find qualified immunity for the\nindividual Defendants exists, Plaintiffs also request injunctive relief which is not barred by qualified\nimmunity so discovery on the constitutionality of spraying Plaintiffs’ with a delousing solution will\nstill proceed. See Williams v. Ozmint, No. 11–6940, 2013 WL 1987231, *5 (May 15, 2013) (“The\ndefense of qualified immunity has no bearing, however, on claims for prospective court action such\nas injunctive relief.” (citations omitted)).  Therefore, the Court DENIES Defendants’ motion to\ndismiss  Plaintiffs’ claims with respect to the delousing policy.\nIn their motion, Defendants further argue that Plaintiffs’ proposed classes must be\nreformulated under Florence to exclude those individuals who were placed into a general housing\nunit.8  As Plaintiffs’ have not yetr equested class certification and the parties have not fully briefed \n7See Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224, 227 (1991) (“stress[ing] the importance of resolving\nimmunity questions at the earliest possible stage in litigation”(citations omitted)).\n8Plaintiffs propose to represent the following two classes and a subclass of detainees:\n(continued...)\n16\n\n8(...continued)\nCLASS ONE:\nAll persons who have been or will be placed into the\ncustody of the West Virginia Regional Jail System,\nafter being charged with m isdemeanors, summary\nviolations, violations of probation, traffic infractions,\ncivil commitments or other minor crimes and were or\nwill  be deloused upon their entry into the W est\nVirginia Regional Jail System, pursuant to the policy,\ncustom and practice of the W est Virginia Regional\nJail and Correctional Facility Authority.

Miller, individually and in his official capacity\nas Executive Director of the West Virginia Regional Jail and Correctional Facility Authority, by and\nthrough counsel David J. Mincer, Joshua K. Boggs, and the law firm of Bailey & Wyant, PLLC, and\nfor their Memorandum in Support of Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s First Amended\nComplaint do state unto the Court as follows:\nI. INTRODUCTION\nWVRJA maintains a policy by which incoming detainees go through a visual strip search and\ndelousing procedure to ensure that detainees are not concealing weapons or contraband, and are\nwithout lice and/or scabies.  The WVRJA has determined that such procedures are necessary for\nsafety and health reasons.  Plaintiff alleges that the strip search and delousing procedure to which\nhe was subjected subsequent to his arrest and detainment at the Western Regional Jail was a\nviolation of his constitutional right against unreasonable searches and in violation of his right to\nprivacy.  Plaintiff further suggests that as a pre-trial detainee detained on only misdemeanor charges,\nas opposed to a post-conviction detainee or a detainee being held on felony charges, it is a violation\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 17   Filed 10/28/09   Page 2 of 21 PageID #: 106\nof his constitutional rights to be subjected to these procedures.  The United States Supreme Court\nhas previously addressed this exact same issue and the claims of Plaintiff and has held on numerous\noccasions that a visual strip search and delousing of detainees, including pre-trial detainees charged\nonly with misdemeanors, does not violate their constitutional rights.  The Courts have uniformly\nnoted that detainment in a correctional facility inherently comes with certain restrictions and\ninfringements on one’s constitutional rights and those restrictions are constitutionally valid if they\nare related to a legitimate penological interest as opposed to having been implemented purely as a\npunitive measure as long as there are no outstanding circumstances which heighten the severity of\nthe constitutional violation so that it outweighs the penological interest.  As WVRJA’s visual strip\nsearch and delousing policies are implemented in a minimally intrusive fashion and for the dual\npurpose of detecting and deterring the smuggling of contraband and weapons into the facilities and\nto protect the health and safety of all detainees and correctional officers, the policies are instituted\nfor a legitimate penological interest.   As such, the WVRJA policies are justifiable and are not a\nconstitutional violation for which this Plaintiff should be permitted to pursue this cause of action\nagainst these Defendants.\nFurthermore, Plaintiff may not maintain this action, because he has failed to exhaust his\nadministrative remedies within the jail system prior to filing this action.  In addition, Plaintiff may\nnot maintain this action, because the Defendants are immune from his claims under the Eleventh\nAmendment to the United States Constitution and the Will Doctrine.  Finally, Defendant Terry\nMiller is entitled to qualified immunity with respect to the claims asserted against him.  For all of\nthe foregoing reasons, the Defendants are entitled to the dismissal of this action. \nII. STATEMENT OF FACTS\nOn September 28, 2008, Plaintiff, Michael Cantley, was arrested at the home of his ex-wife\nafter violating a Domestic Violence Protective Order that was issued against him pursuant to a claim\n2\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 17   Filed 10/28/09   Page 3 of 21 PageID #: 107\nof domestic violence made by his ex-wife.  Following the arrest, Plaintiff was taken to the Western\nRegional Jail, located in Barboursville, Cabell County, West Virginia.  Upon his arrival at the\nfacility, Plaintiff exhibited hostile and violent behavior towards the correctional officers, including\nthreatening to strangle one of the nurses at the facility when she attempted to check Plaintiff’s pulse.\nBecause of this behavior, Plaintiff initially had to be restrained until he was calm enough to proceed\nthrough the admission process.  \nAfter Plaintiff calmed down, he was then “patted down” by one of the correctional officers\nfor the purpose of locating any contraband or weapons concealed in the Plaintiff’s clothing.\nFollowing the “pat-down,” Plaintiff was pre-screened by the medical department and then his\nclothing and personal belongings were inventoried.  Plaintiff was then pictured and finger printed.\nNext, the Plaintiff was taken to a private shower area and was asked by a male correctional officer\nto remove his clothing.  Plaintiff was asked to squat and cough, and then asked to bend over at the\nwaist.  Additionally, Plaintiff was asked to lift his genitals so that the correctional officer could\ndetermine that the Plaintiff had not taped anything to his body.  Plaintiff was not touched in any way\nduring this procedure.  Once the visual search was complete, Plaintiff was sprayed with a non-toxic\nsolution called Liceall and after a short waiting period, he was asked to shower.  The purpose of the\ndelousing process is to ensure that the detainee is free of lice and scabies prior to being intermingled\nwith the rest of the prison population.  Like the search procedure, Plaintiff was not touched in any\nway during the delousing.1  Plaintiff was then issued prison clothing and admitted to the jail. \nOn or about July 1, 2009, Plaintiff filed a Class Action Complaint with this court naming the\nWest Virginia Jail and Correctional Facility Authority as well as Terry Miller, Executive Director\n1      Plaintiff alleges that some individuals undergoing the strip search procedure are required to undergo a\nphysical cavity search in which a Corrections Officer inserts a gloved finger into the rectum of the detainee; however\nPlaintiff acknowledges that his search was purely visual.  While Plaintiff’s allegation regarding other detainees is\nfactually incorrect, that allegation would be irrelevant to his claims in any case.  He acknowledges he was not\ntouched during his visual strip search and delousing procedure.\n3\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 17   Filed 10/28/09   Page 4 of 21 PageID #: 108\nof the West Virginia Regional Jail and Correctional Facility Authority, as Defendants.  Plaintiff’s\nComplaint alleged that the Defendants’ policy of visually strip searching and delousing all\nindividuals who enter one of the West Virginia Regional Jails, regardless of the crime with which\nthey are charged, constitutes a violation of his privacy rights and the right to be free from\nunreasonable searches under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  \nOn October 9, 2009, Plaintiff filed an Amended Class Action Complaint that is virtually\nidentical in the allegations asserted against these Defendants other than attaching a copy of the\nWVRJA  “Policy  and  Procedure  Statement,”  dated  May  15,  19972,  and  asserting  additional\nallegations regarding the use of a delousing solution in the administration of WVRJA’s policy of\ndelousing detainees located within its facilities. Plaintiff seeks to have certified a class action on\nbehalf of himself and other individuals who have been or will be placed into the custody of the West\nVirginia Regional Jail System after being charged with misdemeanors or other minor crimes and will\nundergo the visual strip search and delousing procedure prior to their entry into the West Virginia\nRegional Jail System.3 \nSpecifically, Plaintiff alleges that he should not have been subjected to WVRJA’s visual strip\nsearch and delousing procedure since his charge involved the non-violent offense of violating an\nDomestic Violence Protective Order.  Further, Plaintiff asserts that his charge did not involve a claim\nthat he caused harm to anyone else, but was simply an allegation that he was present in a location\nwhere he was forbidden to be pursuant to the Order of Protection.  As such, Plaintiff contends that\nhis arrest provided no reasonable basis for jail officials to suspect that he harbored either weapons\n2\n While it is assumed that Plaintiff has attached the policy as evidence of a “wholesale” strip search and\ndelousing procedure at WVRJA facilities, with regard to searches the policy only states that inmates being received\nwill receive a “pat search” and that a “a thorough search of the inmate’s person shall be conducted when\nappropriate.” Nowhere within the policy is it stated or implied that all incoming detainees are subjected to a strip\nsearch.  Defendants do not contest that WVRJA policy requires that inmates be deloused prior to being placed in a\nWVRJA facility.\n3\nThe Defendants certainly believe that there are numerous reasons why class certification should not be\ngranted and intend to vigorously contest class certification should this Court deny their Motion to Dismiss.\n4\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 17   Filed 10/28/09   Page 5 of 21 PageID #: 109\nor contraband.  While Plaintiff’s labeling of his reason for arrest as non-violent is curious given that\nit was a violation of a Domestic Violence Protective Order, the charges upon which the arrest were\nmade are inapposite factually to the need for a visual strip search and delousing policy to be\nimplemented and, under the controlling case law handed down by the United States Supreme Court,\ninapposite legally to whether Plaintiff’s constitutional rights were violated. \nDefendants acknowledge that Plaintiff was visually strip searched and deloused upon his\nadmission to Western Regional Jail, pursuant to WVRJA policy.  Additionally, while Plaintiff\nalleges that a correctional officer conducted the strip search and delousing and observed his shower\nafterwards, Plaintiff does not allege that anyone else, whether employees of the jail or inmates,\nwitnessed any of the above.  As a result of the procedure as described above, Plaintiff now claims\nthat he suffered and is suffering psychological pain, humiliation, and mental anguish.  In this regard,\nPlaintiff seeks the following from these Defendants: monetary damages, a declaration that the\nDefendants’ policies are unconstitutional, and an injunction precluding the Defendants from\nadministering the policies regarding the strip search and delousing of its detainees. \nIII.  STANDARD FOR MOTION TO DISMISS\nA motion to dismiss based on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state\na claim upon which relief can be granted functions “to test the formal sufficiency of the statement\nof the claim for relief, and is not a procedure for resolving a contest about the facts or merits of the\ncase.”  Henegar v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 965 F.Supp. 833 (N.D.W. Va. 1997).  In considering a\nmotion to dismiss on 12(b)(6) grounds, a dismissal is granted when “the allegations raised in the\ncomplaint clearly demonstrate that plaintiff does not have a claim and that no set of facts would\nsupport plaintiff’s claim.”  Booth v. Old Nat’l Bank, 900 F.Supp. 836 (N.D.W. Va. 1995).  A motion\nto dismiss should be granted where “it appears certain that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts\nwhich would support its claim and would entitle it to relief.”  Collins v. SWVA, Inc., 2005 WL\n5\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 17   Filed 10/28/09   Page 6 of 21 PageID #: 110\n1639305 (S.D.W. Va. 2005).  While the Court should accept as true all well-pleaded allegations and\nshould view the complaint in a light favorable to the Plaintiff, “the court need not, however, accept\nunsupported legal conclusions, legal conclusions couched as factual allegations, or conclusory\nfactual allegations devoid of any reference to actual events.”  Collins v. Red Roof Inns, Inc., 248\nF.Supp.2d 512, 515-516 (S.D.W. Va. 2003).  Even viewing the facts alleged by Plaintiff as true,\nbased on the precedent set by our United States Supreme Court, there is no legal basis for Plaintiff’s\nclaims and the Defendants are entitled to the dismissal of this action.  Furthermore, both Defendants\nare entitled to dismissal due to Plaintiff’s failure to exhaust administrative remedies and under the\n11th Amendment and the Will doctrine and Defendant Miller is entitled to immunity from this suit.\nIV. ARGUMENT\nA. The Supreme Court of the United States established long ago that the significant\nand legitimate security interests of the institution weigh heavily in favor of\nconducting strip searches of pretrial detainees on less than probable cause and\nas such, these searches are not unreasonable and do not constitute a violation\nof a detainee’s right to privacy.\nAs stated above, Plaintiff asserts that the Defendants’ policy, wherein pre-trial detainees\ncharged with non-felonious crimes are strip searched and deloused, is an unreasonable search that\nis in violation of the Fourth Amendment’s protection against unreasonable searches and of the\ndetainee’s  right  to  privacy.    More  specifically,  Plaintiff  states  that  the  Fourth  Amendment\nspecifically “prohibits officers from conducting strip searches and delousing of individuals arrested\nfor misdemeanors or violations absent some particularized suspicion that the individual in question\nhas either contraband or weapons.” See Complaint, ¶ 40.  Plaintiff’s position in that regard is directly\ncontrary to controlling law from the United States Supreme Court as set forth in Bell v. Wolfish, 441\nU.S. 520, 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1884 (1979). \nIn Bell, the Supreme Court considered several challenges made by pretrial detainees in\nrelation to the conditions of confinement and practices present in a federally operated short-term\n6\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 17   Filed 10/28/09   Page 7 of 21 PageID #: 111\ncustodial facility. While most of these challenges are not relevant to the case before this court, one\nof the challenges brought by the pre-trial detainees concerned the practice of conducting visual body-\ncavity searches  of the detainees.  The Bell court recognized that pre-trial detainees have not yet been\nadjudged guilty of any crime and that there is only a “judicial determination of probable cause as a\nprerequisite to [the] extended restraint of [his] liberty following arrest.”  Id. at 536, 99 S.Ct. at 1872.\nNoting that a pre-trial detainee may not be punished prior to an adjudication of guilt in accordance\nwith due process of law, the court found that the individual may be detained in order to ensure his\npresence at trial and pursuant to that goal, the individual may be subjected to the restrictions and\nconditions of the facility so long as those conditions and restrictions do not amount to punishment,\nor otherwise violate the Constitution.  Id. at 536-537, 99 S.Ct. at 1873.  \nIn considering the specific policy that is being challenged, the court must decide whether the\npolicy “is imposed for the purpose of punishment or whether it is but an incident of some other\nlegitimate governmental purpose.”  Id. at 538, 99 S.Ct. at 1873 (quoting Fleming v. Nestor, 363 U.S.\n603, 613-617, 80 S.Ct. 1367, 1374-1376).  The Court explained that unless Plaintiff can demonstrate\nan “expressed intent to punish on the part of facility officials,” this determination should be based\non “whether an alternative purpose to which [the restriction] may rationally be connected is\nassignable to it, and whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned [to\nit].”  Bell, 441 U.S. at 538, 99 S.Ct. at 1874 (quoting Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. 144,\n168-169, 83 S.Ct. 554, 567-568.  Thus, the Bell Court held, “if a particular condition or restriction\nof pretrial detention is reasonably related to a legitimate governmental objective, it does not, without\nmore, amount to “punishment.” 441 U.S. at 539, 83 S.Ct. at 1874.  With respect to identifying those\n“legitimate governmental objective[s]”, the Court noted that “the Government must be able to take\nsteps to maintain security and order at the institution and make certain no weapons or illicit drugs\nreach detainees.”\n7\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 17   Filed 10/28/09   Page 8 of 21 PageID #: 112\nBefore addressing the specific constitutional challenges raised by the detainees, the court\nrecognized that while pretrial detainees, who have not been convicted of any crimes, retain at least\nthose constitutional rights that are held by convicted prisoners, “simply because prison inmates retain\ncertain constitutional rights does not mean that these rights are not subject to restrictions and\nlimitations.”  Id. at 545, 99 S.Ct. at 1877.  Noting that institutional security as well as internal order\nand discipline are essential goals that may require limitation or retraction of retained constitution\nrights, the court held that “prison officials must be free to take appropriate action to ensure the safety\nof inmates and corrections personnel and to prevent escape or unauthorized entry” and in this regard,\nthe goal of maintaining institutional security is “central to all other corrections goals.” Id. at 546-547,\n99 S.Ct. at 1878 (quoting Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 823, 94 S.Ct. 2800, 2804).\nBecause of the need to preserve institutional security and order, the Bell Court recognized\nthat prison administrators have a certain perspective and expertise in this regard that others,\nincluding members of the judicial branch, simply do not have.  In light of this fact, the Court held\nthat prison administrators “should be accorded wide-ranging deference in the adoption and execution\nof policies and practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal order and discipline\nand to maintain institutional security.”  441 U.S. at 547, 99 S.Ct. at 1878.  This deference should be\nafforded because these issues are “peculiarly within the province and professional expertise of\ncorrections officials” and because prison officials “have a better grasp of his domain than the\nreviewing judge” and “the operation of our correctional facilities is peculiarly within the province\nof the Legislative and Executive Branches of our Government, not the Judicial. 441 U.S. at 548, 99\nS.Ct. at 1879 (citing to Pell, 417 U.S. at 827, 94 S.Ct. at 2806; Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396,\n405,  94 S.Ct. 1800, 1807 (1974)). \nWith the notion that the constitutional rights of pre-trial detainees can be restricted if the\nrestriction is related to a legitimate governmental objective and that deference should be afforded\n8\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 17   Filed 10/28/09   Page 9 of 21 PageID #: 113\nto prison officials in this regard, the Bell Court turned to a consideration of the detainees’ challenge\nwith regard to the visual body-cavity searches, which are generically referred to as a “strip search.”\nJust as in the case at issue, the Bell Court was evaluating a purely visual strip search with on\ntouching involved.  Just as in Bell, WVRJA strip searches are conducted by a member of the same\nsex as the detainee.  Further, WVRJA strip searches are conducted in a place out of the sight of other\nstaff members and other inmates. \nWhile the Court in Bell was confronted with a policy that required inmates, including pre-\ntrial detainees, to expose their bodies for visual inspection following every contact visit with a\nperson from the outside, there is no reason to believe that the court’s analysis in this regard would\nnot apply to a policy like WVRJA’s that requires the search of a pre-trial detainee when s/he is first\nbrought to the facility.  While some jurisdictions have tried to categorize the Bell holding in this\nregard and it is anticipated that Plaintiff will attempt to do the same, there is no reasoning that would\nsupport making that type of distinction.  At the heart of the Bell court’s analysis is the reasoning that\na visual cavity search is “necessary not only to discover but to deter the smuggling of weapons,\ndrugs, and other contraband into the institution.” 411 U.S. at 558, 99 S. Ct. at 1884.  It is\nindisputable that this is the goal behind WVRJA’s strip search policy; in fact, Plaintiff makes no\nallegations to the contrary.  Given this fact, there is simply no reason why the Bell analysis would\nnot extend to the search of a pre-trial detainee upon his/her initial entry into the facility.  Noting that\nthe detainees’ allegations of constitutional violations are based on the Fourth Amendment and its\nvarious constitutional guarantees, the Bell court concluded that visual cavity strip searches of pretrial\ndetainees are not in violation of the Fourth Amendment, as only  “unreasonable” searches are\nprohibited.  Evaluating the circumstances and purpose surrounding the strip searches along with the\nmanner in which they are conducted, the court held that the searches were not unreasonable and were\nnot in violation of the detainees’ constitutional rights.  Given that the policy at issue in Bell is\n9\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 17   Filed 10/28/09   Page 10 of 21 PageID #: 114\nvirtually identical to the WVRJA policy, this Court should find that WVRJA’s policies are also\nreasonable and constitutionally sound.   \nReferencing its articulation of the “reasonableness test” by which the Plaintiff’s allegations\nof constitutional violations should be evaluated, the court held that this test is not able to be defined\nprecisely and should not be applied in a mechanical fashion as each case “requires a balancing of the\nneed for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails.  Courts\nmust consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the\njustification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.”  Bell, 411 U.S. at 559, 99 S. Ct.\nat 1884.  The Court noted that a detention facility “is a unique place fraught with serious security\ndangers.  Smuggling of money, drugs, weapons, and other contraband is all too common an\noccurrence.  And inmate attempts to secret these items into the facility by concealing them in body\ncavities are documented in this accord.” Id. (referencing U.S. v. Edwards, 536 F.Supp. 2d 977\n(D.Minn. 2008), Bonner v. Outlaw, 552 F.3d 673 (8th cir. 2009), Young v. County of Cook, 598 F.\nSupp. 2d 854 (N.D. Ill. 2009),  Allison v. GEO Group, Inc., 611 F.Supp.2d 433 (E.D.Pa. 2009),\nYoung v. County of Cook, 616 F. Supp.2d 834 (N.D.Ill. 2009), Chehade Refai v. Lazaro, 614\nF.Supp.2d 1103 (D.Nev. 2009), and Beerheide v. Suthers, 286 F.3d 1179 (10th Cir. 2002)).\nFocusing on the allegation that strip searches are a violation of a detainee’s right to privacy,\nthe court recognized that strip searches may invade the personal privacy of the individual and also\nrecognized that on occasion a search may be conducted in an abusive fashion.  Despite this,  the\ncourt held that the appropriate question is “whether visual body-cavity inspections ... can ever be\nconducted on less than probable cause.”  Bell, 441 U.S. 520, 560, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1885.  After\n“balancing the significant and legitimate security interests of the institution against the privacy\ninterests” of the detainees, the Bell court held that the institutional goals or ensuring safety and\nsecurity in the facility was so detrimental to these facilities that visual body-cavity inspections or\n10\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 17   Filed 10/28/09   Page 11 of 21 PageID #: 115\nstrip searches can be conducted on less than probable cause.  Furthermore, the court found that the\ndetainees did not meet their heavy burden of demonstrating that the officials exaggerated their\nresponse to the indisputable security concerns at the facility.  In the instant case, Plaintiff asserts that\nhis search was conducted without “reasonable suspicion” that he possessed weapons or contraband.\nIt is clear that “reasonable suspicion” as used by the Plaintiff and “probable cause” are referring to\nthe same question of whether there is justification for a correctional officer to believe that a\nparticular detainee may possess weapons or contraband.  Thus, Bell’s analysis regarding probable\ncause can and should be extended to find that strip searches conducted pursuant to WVRJA policy\ncan be conducted on less than “reasonable suspicion.” \nAnticipating that lower courts would dissect and compartmentalize its rulings, the Bell court\nincluded a warning against courts becoming “increasingly enmeshed in the minutiae of prison\noperations.” Id. at 561, 99 S.Ct. at 1886.  Doing so, the court noted, would go against the spirit of\nthe Constitution since under the Constitution, “the first question to be answered is not whose plan\nis best, but in what branch of the Government is lodged the authority to initially devise the plan.”\nId.  The court continued that “the inquiry of federal courts into prison management must be limited\nto the issue of whether a particular system violates any prohibition of the Constitution or, in the case\nof a federal prison, a statute.  The wide range of “judgment calls” that meet constitutional and\nstatutory requirements are confided to officials outside of the Judicial Branch of the Government.”\nId.  Therefore, unless a particular policy clearly violates a particular Constitutional right or\nprohibition, the Judicial Branch should be relatively hands-off with regard to the integral decisions\nunique to prison administration. \nAfter Bell was decided, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit had the\noccasion in Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007 (1981) to apply those standards enunciated by the Bell\ncourt in relation to a strip search by prison officials of a female DWI arrestee following her arrest\n11\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 17   Filed 10/28/09   Page 12 of 21 PageID #: 116\nand arrival at the jail facility.  The detainee in Logan alleged that the strip search policy was\nunreasonable in both scope and manner as it was conducted without a warrant or probable cause and\ntherefore, was in violation of various unspecified Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, and\nconstituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment.  Using the\nbalancing test articulated in Bell, the court found that the policy in question was unconstitutional in\nthat it “bore no such discernible relationship to security needs ... when balanced against the ultimate\ninvasion of personal rights involved.”  Id. at 1013. The court based its decision on its evaluation of\nthe manner in which this particular search was conducted and the invasion of the detainee’s personal\nrights.  In this regard, the Logan decision can be distinguished from Bell and the case currently\nbefore this court.  The Logan court explicitly based its decision on the fact that the detainee in Logan\nwould not have been intermingled with the general jail population as she was simply being held until\nsomeone picked her up or until she became sober; and second, the strip search in Logan was alleged\nto have occurred in an area exposed to public view.  Neither of these elements are present in the case\nbefore this court.  The search and delousing of Plaintiff occurred in a shower stall out of the view\nof other staff members and other detainees.  Additionally, the WVRJA strip searches are performed\nprecisely because the detainees are intermingled, thereby increasing the security risk associated with\ndoing anything other than a uniform strip search of all detainees.  \nTherefore, while Plaintiff may assert that the court should have just taken it for granted that\nhe was not concealing contraband or weapons since his charge was “non-violent,” this is a risk that\nthe facility simply cannot bear.  It creates the possibility that a “non-violent” detainee will smuggle\nin and provide a “violent” detainee with a weapon, thus endangering the safety of every individual\nin the facility.  Therefore, given that the Logan court’s reasoning was based solely on the basis that\nthe particular invasions, which are not present in the case before this court, outweighed the risk of\nnot performing that particular search,  Logan can be factually and legally distinguished from the case\n12\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 17   Filed 10/28/09   Page 13 of 21 PageID #: 117\nbefore this Court.\nThe standards set forth in Bell have went largely untouched by courts who have utilized those\nstandards in the evaluation of constitutional claims made by detainees.  Eight years after the court\nhanded down its decision in Bell, it took those standards and enumerated specific factors that courts\nshould use in evaluating allegations that a prison regulation has impinged upon a detainee’s\nconstitutional rights.  In Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89, 107 S. Ct. 2254, 2261 (1987), the court\nechoed Bell and held that “when a prison regulation impinges on inmates’ constitutional rights, the\nregulation is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.” Turner v. Safley, 482\nU.S. 78, 89, 107 S. Ct. 2254, 2261 (1987).  Although Turner concerned regulations regarding the\npersonal relationships of inmates, such as marriages and personal correspondence, the Turner\nstandard “applies to all circumstances in which the needs of prison administration implicate\nconstitutional rights,” including circumstances where the claim involves a fundamental right.\nWashington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 223-224, 110 S. Ct. 1028, 1037-1038 (1990).\nTurner acknowledged the principles enunciated in  Bell that “running a prison is an\ninordinately difficult undertaking that requires expertise, planning, and the commitment of resources,\nall of which are peculiarly within the province of the legislative and executive branches of\ngovernment” and that, with regard to issues of prison administration and state penal systems,\n“separation of powers concerns counsel a policy of judicial restraint.”  482 U.S. at 85, 107 S.Ct. at\n2259.  In acknowledgment of this policy of judicial restraint, the court sought to use the Bell\nprinciples to formulate a standard of review that would be responsive to both judicial restraint and\nthe need to protect constitutional rights.  Hence, the court articulated  four factors that a court should\nconsider in determining the reasonableness of a prison regulation: (1) whether there is “a ‘valid,\nrational connection’ between the prison regulation and the legitimate governmental interest put\nforward to justify it,” 482 U.S. at 89, 107 S. Ct. at 2262 (quoting Block v. Rutherford, 468 U.S. 576,\n13\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 17   Filed 10/28/09   Page 14 of 21 PageID #: 118\n586, 104 S. Ct. 3227, 3232 (1984)); (2) “whether there are alternative means of exercising the right\nthat remains open to prison inmates,” Id. at 90, 107 S. Ct. at 2262; (3) “the impact accommodation\nof the asserted constitutional right will have on guards and other inmates, and on the allocation of\nprison resources generally,” Id.; and (4) whether there is a ready alternative to the policy “that fully\naccommodates the prisoner’s rights at de minimis cost to valid penological interests,” Id. at 90-91,\n107 S.Ct. at 2262.\nWhile it is not necessary for this Court to evaluate these factors as to the WVRJA strip search\npolicy, by virtue of the fact that the same policy was upheld as not a violation of detainees’\nconstitutional rights in Bell, it is clear that if this Court engages in that analysis, the strip search\npolicy is clearly non-violative of those rights.  There can be no doubt but that the WVRJA strip\nsearch policy has a rational connection to regulation of the jails and legitimate governmental\ninterests; that there is no other less intrusive means of achieving the purpose of a strip search; and\nthat the adverse impact on guards,  other inmates, and the general public of abandoning the policy\nis detrimental, severe, and recklessly dangerous.\nB. WVRJA’s policy of delousing all pretrial detainees regardless of the crime with\nwhich they are charged does not violate Plaintiff’s constitutional rights in that\nthe policy is rationally related to the legitimate penological interest of preserving\nthe health of all detainees confined within the facility.\nPrior to a consideration of WVRJA’s policy regarding the delousing of pretrial detainees, it\nshould be noted that this is a unique issue that has not squarely been dealt with in an in-depth\nfashion.  Plaintiff alleges that the delousing procedure to which he was subjected was a violation of\nhis right to privacy and also his right to be free from unreasonable searches.  It is unclear, however,\nupon what facts Plaintiff bases his claim.  Plaintiff alleges no direct harm from the delousing and like\nthe strip search procedure, the delousing occurred in a private area with no spectators (other than the\nattending correctional officers) and involved absolutely no touching.  Plaintiff’s claim essentially\namounts to a claim of a violation of his right to privacy for having to remove his clothing and expose\n14\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 17   Filed 10/28/09   Page 15 of 21 PageID #: 119\nhimself to a correctional officer.  This, argument, however is not unique to the delousing procedure\nsince detainees must remove their clothing in order to undergo the visual strip search.  Therefore,\nthe Turner analysis as it is applied to strip searches is clearly applicable here, as well.  Once it is\nestablished that the visual strip search policy is constitutional, Plaintiff no longer has a claim with\nregard to “privacy” as it relates to the delousing procedure, since Plaintiff’s allegations regarding the\nunconstitutionality of the search and delousing procedures rely upon the same central fact - Plaintiff\nmust disrobe in front of a correctional officer. If this withstands constitutional scrutiny as it relates\nto the visual strip search, then it also withstands constitutional scrutiny with regard to the delousing.\nThe delousing procedure is implemented to prevent detainees from bringing lice and scabies\ninto the facility and to prevent the spread of  lice and scabies among other inmates and other areas\nof the facility.  The closest a Court has come to considering this issue was a case considered by the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.  In Russell, et al. v. Richards, 384 F. 3d 444\n(7th Cir. 2004), the court considered a correctional facility’s policy of requiring incoming inmates\nto use a delousing shampoo in order to rid the inmate of lice.  Although Russell concerned a claim\nthat the delousing procedure violated the inmates’ Fourteenth Amendment due process right to be\nfree from unwanted medical treatment, the court’s discussion is applicable here and sheds light on\nthe importance of such a procedure.  The court noted that the purpose of administering the delousing\nshampoo to new inmates was to avoid a lice infestation in the jail.  When lice are noticed on an\ninmate, the inmate and everyone and everything that the inmate has come in contact with must be\ncompletely disinfected, which takes a great deal of time and manpower.  Id. at 446.  Evaluating the\ndelousing procedure in light of these goals, the court found that “there is a satisfactory connection\nbetween the jail’s policy and the interest put forward to justify it” since “the jail has an obligation\nto  ensure  the  safety  and  medical  well-being  of  its  inmates  and  its  personnel.”  Id.  at  448.\nAdditionally, the court held that “the jail has a legitimate interest in preventing its inmate population\n15\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 17   Filed 10/28/09   Page 16 of 21 PageID #: 120\nand staff from being exposed to lice, not to mention a legitimate fiscal interest in avoiding the costs\nassociated with eradicating a lice infestation.” Id. \nC. Given the facts attendant to Plaintiff Cantley’s detention, Plaintiff Cantley\ncannot in good faith allege that a strip search of him in particular was not\nwarranted and that no reasonable suspicion would exist to support his strip\nsearch.  \nPlaintiff has asserted that absent a reasonable suspicion that a particular detainee might be\nsmuggling contraband or a weapon, there is no basis for said detainee to be strip searched and he\nuses that argument as the support for his claim of constitutional rights violations.  Beyond the fact\nthat the United States Supreme Court has already found that argument to be without merit and a\nreasonable suspicion to be unnecessary, the actions of Plaintiff Cantley would have provided\nreasonable suspicion if the Supreme Court required it.  He was arrested for violation of a Domestic\nViolence Protective Order, which is an indication of violence on his part.  He was hostile and\nthreatening to correctional officers upon his entry to the facility. See “WV Regional Jail &\nCorrectional Facility Authority Incident Report # 080928\" attached hereto as Exhibit A.  After being\nsecured in a temporary holding cell, Plaintiff began kicking the holding cell door in an attempt to\nbreak the glass. See Exhibit A.  Plaintiff then began kicking the door to the cell in an attempt to cause\nfurther damage. See Exhibit A.  Plaintiff had to be placed in a restraint chair to ensure Plaintiff’s\nsafety and to keep him from causing harm to himself or others.  See Exhibit A.  Plaintiff attempted\nto remove himself from the restraint chair and when a nurse attempted to check Plaintiff’s pulse  as\npart of the medical screening process, he menacingly and threateningly grabbed her by the hand.  See\nExhibit A.  Plaintiff continually yelled, cursed, and struggled throughout the admission process.\nFurther evidence of Plaintiff’s demeanor and behavior can be found in the “Booking\nSummary Report” as Plaintiff was noted as being “belligerent” upon arrival at Western Regional Jail\nfor admission.  See “Booking Summary Report” attached hereto as Exhibit B.  A “Watch Log” was\nalso kept with regard to this Plaintiff because of his hostile behavior and confirms the information\n16\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 17   Filed 10/28/09   Page 17 of 21 PageID #: 121\nprovided in the Incident Report referenced above.  Specifically, the Watch Log indicates that\nPlaintiff was yelling, struggling, and threatening to strangle one of the officers.  See “Inmate Special\nWatch Log” attached hereto as Exhibit C.  Given the charges against him and his conduct upon\nadmission, it is clear that if a reasonable suspicion was required of WVRJA, that requirement would\nhave been met in this case.\nD. Plaintiff failed to exhaust the administrative remedies available to inmates\nhoused in the WVRJA correctional facilities.\nFollowing the strip search and delousing of Plaintiff, he was housed at the Western Regional\nJail for over a month.  Throughout his incarceration, Plaintiff voiced no complaints regarding the\nstrip search and delousing procedures, and did not initiate the administrative grievance procedure\navailable to all inmates housed in WVRJA correctional facilities.  As such, Plaintiff has failed to\nexhaust the available administrative remedies.\nWith regard to the exhaustion of administrative remedies, 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a) provides that:\n“No action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under § 1997 of the\nrevised statute of the United States or any other federal law, by a prisoner confined\nin any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies\nas are available are exhausted.”  \nThe West Virginia Regional Jail and Correctional Facility Authority provides all inmates with an\nadministrative grievance procedure by which inmates may redress complaints concerning the\nconditions of their confinement at the facility.  All inmates are informed of this procedure as outlined\nin the Inmate Handbook distributed to each inmate upon admission to the jail.  Whenever an inmate\nfeels that he or she has a serious complaint or significant problem, the inmate simply completes an\ninmate grievance addressed to the Administrator of the facility.  Upon receipt of the grievance, the\nAdministrator will, if warranted, investigate the complaint and promptly provide the inmate with a\nwritten decision identifying any corrective action taken or reasons why the grievance is denied.  An\ninmate dissatisfied with the Administrator’s decision may then appeal directly to the Chief of\n17\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 17   Filed 10/28/09   Page 18 of 21 PageID #: 122\nOperations.  After receiving the appeal, the Chief informs the inmate in writing of any corrective\nactions taken or the reasons for a denial of the grievance.  Finally, the inmate is provided a Level III\nappeal directly to the Office of the Executive Director.  Despite the availability of this multi-level\ngrievance procedure and the steps taken to make it accessible to each inmate, Plaintiff failed to avail\nhimself of the same.  See “Affidavit” attached hereto as Exhibit D.\nIn Booth v. Churner, 532 U.S. 731, 149 L.ed.2d 958, 121 S.Ct. 1819 (2001), the United\nStates Supreme Court held that the Prison Litigation Reform Act requires inmates to exhaust\nadministrative remedies even if the inmate seeks only monetary damages and such relief is\nunavailable under the administrative process.  Additionally, in Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 11\nS.Ct. 983, 152 L.ed.2d 12 (2002), the United States Supreme Court held that the Prison Litigation\nReform Acts’ exhaustion requirements are applicable to all inmate suits relating to prison life,\nwhether they involve general circumstances or a particular episode.  Regardless of the circumstance,\nPlaintiff must exhaust the administrative remedies.  Plaintiff’s failure to utilize and exhaust the\nadministrative process in this case should compel this court to dismiss Plaintiff’s Complaint for\nfailure to comply with the requirement imposed by 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a) that inmates exhaust\nadministrative remedies.\nE. The Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution as well as the Will\nDoctrine bar Plaintiff’s claim against Defendants.\nThe United States Supreme Court has held that a suit against a state official in his or her\nofficial capacity is not a suit against the official but rather is a suit against the official’s office.\nBrandon v. Holt, 469 U.S. 464 (1985).  As such, it is not different from a suit against the State itself.\nFurthermore, it has been held that neither a state, nor its officials, acting in their official capacities\nare ‘persons’ under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Will v. Mich. Dept. of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 109 (1989).\nA careful reading of Plaintiff’s Complaint and Amended Complaint reveals that Plaintiff has\nnamed Defendant Terry L. Miller simply because of his official position as a state official, and not\n18\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 17   Filed 10/28/09   Page 19 of 21 PageID #: 123\nbecause of any actual deprivation allegedly undertaken by this Defendant.  Defendant is an agent of\nthe State instrumentality through his employment with the West Virginia Regional Jail and\nCorrectional Facility Authority, a state agency.  As all of the actions alleged in the Complaint were\nrendered in furtherance of Defendant Miller’s official duties in his official capacity as a state official,\nPlaintiff’s claims as to Defendant Terry L. Miller are barred, as are those against the WVRJA. \nF. Qualified good faith immunity shields Defendant Terry L. Miller from claims\nasserted against him in his individual capacity. \nQualified good faith immunity shields a governmental official from liability if the officer’s\nconduct does not violate a clearly established statutory or constitutional right of which a reasonable\nperson in the same position would have known.  Harlow v. Gitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982).\nIt has been held that “in determining whether the specific right allegedly violated was ‘clearly\nestablished,’ the proper focus is not on the right at its most general or abstract level, but at the level\nof its application to the specific conduct being challenged.”  Pritchett v. Alford, 973 F.2d 307, 312\n(4th Cir. 1992).  Moreover, “the manner in which... [the clearly established] right applies to the action\nof the official must also be apparent.”  Maciariello v. Sumner, 973 F.2d 295, 298 (4th Cir. 1992),\nciting Tarantino v. Baker, 825 F.2d 772, 774 (4th Cir. 1987).  Plaintiff has failed to make any\nallegation that a particular action of Defendant Terry L. Miller violated a right, privilege, or\nimmunity secured to the Plaintiff.  As such, Plaintiff’s claims against Defendant Miller in his\nindividual capacity should be dismissed. \nV. CONCLUSION\nThe Defendants are entitled to the dismissal of this action.  The United States Supreme Court\nhas already evaluated the policy and practice that Plaintiff was subjected to by WVRJA in Bell and\ndetermined that the practice of visual strip searches of pre-trial misdemeanor detainees is not a\nviolation of their constitutional rights, because it serves a legitimate penological interest to ensure\n19\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 17   Filed 10/28/09   Page 20 of 21 PageID #: 124\nthe order, safety and security of the institution, there is no alternative that could be used to satisfy\nthe same purposes and without it, the safety of correctional officers, other detainees and the general\npublic would be compromised.  Although delousing has not been evaluated in as much detail by our\nnation’s highest court, the same reasoning applies and under the factors set forth in Turner, it also\ncannot be said to be a violation of a detainee’s constitutional rights.  In addition, even if Plaintiff’s\nposition that there needs to be a reasonable suspicion present to justify a strip search is accepted,\nPlaintiff’s conduct would have provided that reasonable suspicion and justified him being strip\nsearched.  Furthermore, the Defendants are entitled to dismissal of this action based on Eleventh\nAmendment immunity and the Will doctrine and due to Plaintiff’s failure to exhaust administrative\nremedies.  Finally, Defendant Terry Miller is entitled to qualified immunity for the claims asserted\nagainst him.   \nWHEREFORE, for the foregoing reasons, these Defendants move this Honorable Court to\ndismiss the Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be\ngranted, for the attorney fees and costs incurred by Defendants to be assessed against Plaintiff, and\nfor such further and other relief as this Court deems appropriate. \nTERRY L.

INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n \n  The Defendants have acknowledged that they strip search and “delouse” all detainees \nadmitted to the custody of the West Virginia Regional Jail Authority (“WVRJA”), including the \nproposed class representative in this case, Michael Cantley.  This admission is contained in their \nmotion papers, as well as the WVRJA written policies regarding strip searches.  The procedures \nemployed by the WVRJA could not be more humiliating.  All detainees are required to undress \nin front of a corrections officer, manipulate their breasts, genitals and buttocks to allow for an \nexamination of their genitals and body cavities, and then have their privates sprayed down with a \ncaustic delousing solution.   The strip and visual cavity searches of pre-trial detainees conducted \n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 23   Filed 11/17/09   Page 2 of 24 PageID #: 141\nby WVRJA are done in the absence of any particularized reasonable suspicion to believe that \ndetainees are harboring contraband in their private areas.   \nWVRJA Corrections Officers, by the Defendants’ own admission, do not consider the \nseriousness or nature of the charges faced by individual detainees before subjecting them to a \nstrip search.  Many other these searches occur before a detainee is even arraigned.  Amended \nComplaint, ¶ 31.  A legion of federal courts, including the United States Court of Appeals for the \nFourth Circuit and the District of Maryland, have held that strip searches of misdemeanor pre-\ntrial detainees are illegal in the absence of reasonable suspicion.  See, Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d \n1007, 1013 (4th Cir. 1981); Jones v. Murphy, 470 F. Supp.2d 537, 547-48 (D. Md. 2007).  In \nshort, forcing someone charged with a minor crime to undergo the indignity of having a stranger \nvisually examine their private areas, including their vagina and/or rectum, is a quintessential \nexample of an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment.  One appeals court described \nthese  searches  as  being  “demeaning,  dehumanizing,  undignified,  humiliating,  terrifying, \nunpleasant, embarrassing, repulsive, signifying degradation and submission.”  Mary Beth G. v. \nCity of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1272 (7th Cir. 1983).  Over twenty class actions have been \nsuccessfully prosecuted regarding blanket strip search policies.  See, for example, Wilson v. \nCounty of Gloucester, 256 F.R.D. 479 (D.N.J. 2009); Williams v. County of Niagara, 2008 WL \n4501918 (W.D.N.Y. September 29, 2008); Marriott v. County of Montgomery, 227 F.R.D. 159 \n(N.D.N.Y. 2005).     \n  Faced with their own admission that WVRJA strip searches and delouses all detainees, \nincluding  proposed  class  members,  in  the  absence  of  reasonable  suspicion  or  individual \njustification, the Defendants come before this Court, in the absence of any fact discovery, and \nwhile  ignoring  case  precedent,  and  claim  that  their  practices  are  legal  and  proper.    The \n  2\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 23   Filed 11/17/09   Page 3 of 24 PageID #: 142\nDefendants posit five arguments in support of dismissal:   (1) their blanket strip search and \ndelousing  policies  comport  with  the  Constitution  “precisely  because  the  detainees  are \nintermingled” and because jails have a generalized interest in avoiding lice infestations; (2) the \ncircumstances of Mr. Cantley’s entry to the Western Regional Jail, and the charges that Mr. \nCantley was brought in upon, provided reasonable suspicion to strip search him; (3) Plaintiff \nfailed  to  exhaust  administrative  remedies  under  the  Prison  Litigation  Reform  Act;  (4)  the \nEleventh Amendment and the Will Doctrine bars Plaintiff’s claims against Director Miller in his \nofficial capacity; and (5) the doctrine of qualified immunity shields Director Miller from liability \nin his individual capacity.  Many of these arguments ignore the plain language of the Plaintiffs’ \nthorough  Amended  Complaint,  which  details  that:  a)  many  members  of  the  class  are  strip \nsearched and deloused before being arraigned; b) Mr. Cantley was admitted to the WVRJA’s \ncustody on multiple occasions during the proposed class period for misdemeanor charges, not on \njust the one occasion where the Defendants proffer documents that have not been the subject of \nany discovery inquiry; and c) claims regarding illegal strip searches are clearly asserted against \nDefendant Terry Miller, the Executive Director of the Regional Jail Authority, in his individual \ncapacity.  The Defendants remaining arguments conveniently ignore case authority from this and \nother judicial circuits that undermines their claims regarding dismissal for qualified immunity \nand under the exhaustion requirements of the PLRA.     \n   The Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss this action should be denied, both as a matter of \nprocedure and, more importantly, as a matter of law. \n \n \n \n  3\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 23   Filed 11/17/09   Page 4 of 24 PageID #: 143\nII.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n \n  A.   The Defendants’ Illegal, Blanket Strip Search and Delousing Policies.   \n \n  Plaintiff has alleged that the WVRJA and Director Miller have instituted a written and/or \nde facto policy, custom or practice of strip searching and delousing all individuals who enter the \ncustody of the West Virginia Regional Jail System, regardless of the nature of their charged \ncrime  and  without  the  presence  of  reasonable  suspicion  to  believe  that  the  individual  was \nconcealing a weapon or contraband.  Amended Complaint, ¶ 22.  Moreover, the WVRJA and \nDirector Miller have instituted a written and/or de facto policy, custom or practice of conducting \nvisual  body  cavity  searches  (visual  inspection  of  the  vaginal  and  rectal  cavities)  on  all \nindividuals who enter the custody of the West Virginia Regional Jail System, regardless of the \nindividual characteristics or the nature of their charged crime.  Amended Complaint, ¶¶ 23-25.  \n  Plaintiffs have alleged that that the WVRJA and Director Miller have instituted a written \nand/or de facto policy, custom or practice of delousing all individuals who enter the custody of \nthe West Virginia Regional Jail System, regardless of the individual characteristics or the nature \nof their charged crime. Amended Complaint, ¶ 27.  The delousing procedure first entails a \ndetainee completely disrobing in front of a correction officer.  Id.  The correction officer then \nsprays delousing solution upon a detainee's naked body.   Id.  Finally, the detainee is ordered to \nshower within full view of the corrections officer.   Id. The delousing procedure is conducted \nupon all detainees without inquiry into or establishment of reasonable suspicion, or inquiry or \nestablishment into whether the detainee actually harbors lice.  Id.  The Plaintiff’s Amended \nComplaint  also  states  that  many  detainees  are  strip  searched  and  deloused  before  being \narraigned, and that a substantial number of proposed class members are strip searched and \ndeloused only to be released from WVRJA facilities a short time later.  Amended Complaint, ¶ \n  4\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 23   Filed 11/17/09   Page 5 of 24 PageID #: 144\n31.   \n  Aside from denying physical cavity searches, the Defendants have not denied that they \nperform blanket strip searches and delousing on all detainees who enter the West Virginia \nRegional Jail system.  See Defendants’ Brief at 5.  Rather, Defendants have attempted to justify \ntheir blanket strip search policy on the basis of intermingling: “the WVRJA strip searches are \nperformed precisely because the detainees are intermingled, thereby increasing the security risk \nassociated  with  doing  anything  other  than  a  uniform  strip  search  of  all  detainees.”    See \nDefendants’ Brief at p. 12.  The Defendants fail to provide any facts that justify this argument – \nfor instance – detailing to the Court the number of occasions when contraband is actually found, \nnor have the Plaintiffs had an opportunity to challenge these assertions.  See, Ford v. City of \nBoston, 154 F. Supp.2d 131, 134 (D. Mass. 2001) (contraband discovered “five times,” or 0.063 \npercent  of  the  time,  during  admissions  at  Suffolk  County  Jail  undermines  claims  of \nreasonableness).  The Defendants also ignore the well-pled allegations of the Plaintiffs complaint \ndetailing  that  WVRJA  detainees  are  routinely  strip  searched  and  deloused  prior  to  being \narraigned before a judge.  Amended Complaint, ¶ 31.   \nThe Defendants have failed to proffer any justification whatsoever for their blanket \ndelousing policy other than citing to Russell v. Richards, 384 F.3d 444 (7th Cir. 2004), where, \nunlike here, the defendant adduced evidence of lice infestations in the jail.  Plaintiff has had no \nopportunity to take discovery into the factual justification, if any, to substantiate the Defendants’ \nneed to conduct blanket strip searches and delousing on new pretrial detainees. \n \n \n \n  5\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 23   Filed 11/17/09   Page 6 of 24 PageID #: 145\n  B.   Facts Relevant to the Named Plaintiff Michael Cantley.   \n  Contrary  to  the  factual  recitation  put  forward  by  the  Defendants,  Plaintiff  Michael \nCantley has been admitted to the custody of the WVRJA on multiple occasions during the \nproposed class period for misdemeanor charges.   Mr. Cantley alleges that the charges brought \nagainst him did not support a claim that he “possessed weapons or contraband in private areas.” \nAmended Complaint, ¶ 43.    Defendants, in turn, contend that the charges brought against Mr. \nCantley – on one occasion -- were indicative of violence, thus providing reasonable suspicion to \nstrip search him.  See Defendants’ Brief at 15-16.  Defendants further submit three documents \nfrom  the  Western  Regional  Jail,  which  they  contend  show  that  Plaintiff  was  hostile  and \nbelligerent upon his entry of the jail, thus providing reasonable suspicion for his strip search.  See \nid. and Exhibits A-C thereto.  Plaintiff’s counsel has not had opportunity to take any discovery \ninto the circumstances of Mr. Cantley’s multiple entries into the WVRJA facilities, including the \ninstance detailed in the Defendants’ motion papers. The Plaintiffs maintain that discovery will \ndemonstrate that the facts posited by the Defendants are nothing but a post hoc effort to justify \nMr. Cantley being strip searched and deloused under their blanket policy.         \nIII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \n \nA Rule 12(b)(6) motion “should only be granted if, after accepting all well-pleaded \nallegations in the plaintiff's complaint as true and drawing all reasonable factual inferences from \nthose facts in the plaintiff's favor, it appears certain that the plaintiff cannot prove any set of facts \nin support of his claim entitling him to relief.” Ruttenberg v. Jones, 283 Fed. Appx. 121, 128 (4th \nCir. 2008) (quoting Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, 178 F.3d 231, 244 (4th Cir. 1999)).  To \nsurvive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint must contain sufficient factual \nmatter, accepted as true, to “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, \n  6\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 23   Filed 11/17/09   Page 7 of 24 PageID #: 146\n129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, (2007)). “When \nthere  are  well-pleaded  factual  allegations,  a  court  should  assume  their  veracity  and  then \ndetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.” Iqbal at 1950.  A claim is \nfacially plausible when the alleged facts “allow[] the court to draw the reasonable inference that \nthe defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Iqbal at 1949.       \n  “A district court may not resolve factual  disputes  on  Rule  12(b)(6)  motion  without \nconverting motion into one for summary judgment under Rule 56.”  Andrew v. Clark, 561 F.3d \n261, 267 (4th Cir. 2009) (citing Bosiger v. U.S. Airways, 510 F.3d 442, 450 (4th Cir. 2007).  \nIV.  ARGUMENT \n  A.  The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, Along With the Overwhelmingly Majority  \n    of Federal Courts, Have Held that Blanket Jail Strip Search Policies are    \n    Unconstitutional When Applied to Individuals Charged With Misdemeanors or  \n    Other Minor Crimes. \n \n  Defendants  argue  that  their  uniform  strip  search  policy  is  Constitutional  under  the \nbalancing test set forth by the Supreme Court in Bell v. Wolfish, as applied by the Fourth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals in Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007, 1013 (4th Cir. 1981), cert. denied sub nom. \nClements v. Logan, 455 U.S. 942, 71 L. Ed. 2d 653, 102 S. Ct. 1435 (1982).  Specifically, \nDefendants  contend  that  their  blanket  strip  searches  “are  performed  precisely  because  the \ndetainees are intermingled, thereby increasing the security risk associated with doing anything \nother than a uniform strip search of all detainees.”  See Defendants’ Brief at p. 11-12.  For this \nreason, Defendants assert their blanket strip search policy  passes muster under Bell.  This \nargument, however, is wholly contradicted by Logan and the overwhelming majority of case \nprecedent from other judicial circuits, as intermingling alone has never been found to provide \nsufficient basis to justify a blanket strip search policy.  See, e.g., Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d \n1248, 1254 (6th Cir.1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 977 (1989) (citing to Logan and finding that \n  7\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 23   Filed 11/17/09   Page 8 of 24 PageID #: 147\n“the  fact  of  intermingling  alone  has  never  been  found  to  justify  such  a  search  without \nconsideration of the nature of the offense and the question of whether there is any reasonable \nbasis  for  concern  that  the  particular  detainee  will  attempt  to  introduce  weapons  or  other \ncontraband to the institution”); Allison v. GEO Group, 611 F. Supp.2d 433, 460-61 (E.D. Pa. \n2009).      \n  The Fourth Amendment protects citizens against unreasonable searches and seizures by \nthe government.  In the context of searches incident to criminal detention, the United States \nSupreme Court held in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979), that: \n[t]he test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise \ndefinition or mechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing of the \nneed for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the \nsearch entails. Courts must consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the \nmanner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in \nwhich it is conducted. \n \nId. at 559.   An examination of one’s naked body, especially someone’s anus and vagina, clearly \nconstitutes “an invasion of personal rights of the first magnitude.” Chapman v. Nichols, 989 F.2d \n393, 395 (10th Cir. 1993). “[F]ew exercises of authority by the state… intrude on a citizen’s \nprivacy and dignity as severely as the visual anal and genital searches practiced here.” Mary Beth \nG. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1272 (7th Cir. 1983).   \n  In addressing the propriety of blanket strip search policies, the Fourth Circuit has held \nthat  an  “indiscriminate  strip  search  policy  routinely  applied  to  detainees  such  as  [the \nmisdemeanant plaintiff] along with all other detainees cannot be constitutionally justified simply \non the basis of administrative ease in attending to security considerations.”  Logan, 660 F.2d at  \n \n  8\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 23   Filed 11/17/09   Page 9 of 24 PageID #: 148\n1013.1  In Logan, the plaintiff was arrested for driving while intoxicated and ordered to be held \nfor four hours or until released to a responsible person.  Id. She was taken to a holding area and \nsubjected to a visual strip search.  Id.  In reversing a directed verdict for the defendants the court \nof appeals found that the search was unrelated to any discernible security needs and could not \nreasonably be thought justified when balanced against the nature of the intrusion. Id.  See also, \nAbshire v. Walls, 830 F.2d 1277, 1279-80 (4th Cir. 1987) (strip search of pre-trial detainee ruled \nunconstitutional, “the standard in this circuit for judging the constitutionality of a strip search of \na pre-trial detainee is firmly established”).  The Fourth Circuit listed four factors that led to its \nconclusion in Logan: (1) the plaintiff would not be intermingled with the general jail population; \n(2) the offense, although not a minor traffic violation, was not one usually associated with the \npossession of weapons or contraband; (3) there was no cause to believe that this particular \ndetainee might possess either; and (4) when the search was conducted the plaintiff had been at \nthe detention center for one and one-half hours without even a pat down.  Id.  District Courts \nwithin the Fourth Circuit have also addressed blanket strip search policies, and have uniformly \nfound them to be unconstitutional.  See Jones v. Murphy, 470 F. Supp. 2d 537, 547-548 (D. Md. \n2007) (citing Logan, 660 F.2d at 1013-14 (explaining that \"[a]n indiscriminate strip search policy \nroutinely applied to detainees [whose underlying offense is unlikely to involve weapons or \ncontraband] cannot be constitutionally justified . . .\"); see also Smith v. Montgomery County, 643 \n                                                           \n1 Further, the overwhelming majority of Circuit Courts, when considering the balancing test required by Bell, have \nlikewise held that strip searches cannot be utilized against individuals charged with, but not convicted of, minor \ncrimes (misdemeanors, summary offenses, arrests on bench warrants, etc.) in the absence of reasonable suspicion to \nbelieve a detainee is in possession of a weapon or contraband.  See Wood v. Hancock County Sheriff’s Dep’t., 354 \nF.3d 57, 62 (1st Cir. 2003); Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 801 (2d Cir. 1986); Stewart v. Lubbock County, 767 F.2d \n153, 156-57 (5th Cir. 1985); Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1253 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 977 (1989); \nMary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1273; Jones v. Edwards, 770 F.2d 739, 742 (8th Cir. 1985); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d \n614, 617 (9th Cir. 1984); Chapman v. Nichols, 989 F.2d 393, 395-96 (10th Cir. 1993).  This is because “[r]equiring \nparticularized reasonable suspicion to strip search misdemeanant arrestees balances institutional security needs with \nindividual privacy, which includes a reasonable expectation not to be unclothed involuntarily, to be observed \nunclothed or to have one’s private parts observed or touched by others.” Wood, 354 F.3d at 62 (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). \n \n  9\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 23   Filed 11/17/09   Page 10 of 24 PageID #: 149\nF. Supp. 435, 439-43 (D. Md. 1986) (holding that strip searching \"all felony arrestees, and all \ntemporary detainees arrested for misdemeanor offenses that involve weapons or contraband\" was \nconstitutional but explaining that blanket strip search policy regardless of underlying offense was \nunconstitutional). \n  Moreover, Defendants’ reliance upon “intermingling” with the general prison population \nis unavailing as a justification for blanket strip searches. As detailed above, the Fourth Circuit in \nLogan cited to a total of four factors in determining that the blanket strip searches at issue were \nunconstitutional, including two factors that Defendants ignore in their brief: whether a detainee’s \noffense  was  commonly  associated  by  its  very  nature  with  the  possession  of  weapons  or \ncontraband and whether there cause in a detainee’s specific case to believe that he or she might \npossess weapons or contraband.  Logan, 660 F.2d at 1013.  The Logan court then held that \nblanket  strip  searches  could  not  be  based  on  “administrative  ease  in  attending  to  security \nconsiderations.”  Id.  Thus, Logan directly contravenes the Defendants’ proffered justification for \nthe blanket strip searches here: that they “are performed precisely because the detainees are \nintermingled.” Defendants’ Brief at 11-12.  Instead, the Court in Logan applied the balancing test \nrequired by Bell after having full information about the searches in question.  Looking to one \nfactor from Logan is both unfair and a mischaracterization of the Fourth Circuit’s holding.  This \nis especially true given that the Plaintiffs’ complaint alleges that many members of the proposed \nclass were strip search before being arraigned, which would directly undermine concerns about \ncommingling  because  many  detainees  would  presumably  then  be  released.    Other  courts, \nincidentally, have reached the same conclusion in finding intermingling alone lacking as a \njustification for blanket strip searches.  See Masters, 872 F.2d at 1254 (citing to Logan and \nfinding that “intermingling alone” has never been found to justify blanket strip searches); see \n  10\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 23   Filed 11/17/09   Page 11 of 24 PageID #: 150\nalso Roberts v. State of Rhode Island, 239 F.3d 107, 112-113 (1st Cir. 2001) (“the deterrent \nrationale for the Bell search is simply less relevant given the essentially unplanned nature of an \narrest and subsequent incarceration”); Walsh v. Franco, 849 F.2d 66, 68 (2nd Cir. 1988) (blanket \nstrip searching is not acceptable merely because intermingling existed);  Young v. County of \nCook, 616 F. Supp. 2d 834, 848 (N.D. Ill. 2009) (“though intermingling with general prisoners \nmay be one factor in evaluating the reasonableness of a strip search policy, that fact standing \nalone  is  not  enough  to  justify  strip  searches  in  the  absence  of  individualized  reasonable \nsuspicion”) (cited in Defendants’ brief); Allison v. GEO Group, Inc., 611 F. Supp. 2d 433, 460-\n61 (E.D. Pa. 2009) (citations omitted) (“the Court is not influenced by the fact that some persons \ndo anticipate their own arrests and might have the opportunity to conceal contraband. . . Such \ncircumstances do not justify an otherwise unreasonable blanket policy.”) (cited by Defendants’ \nbrief); Newkirk v. Sheers, 834 F. Supp. 772, 789-90 (E.D. Pa. 1993) (rejecting defendants' \nargument that the strip searches of non-violent protestors pursuant to a blanket policy was \nreasonable  because  persons  \"'who  commit  actions  intending  or  expecting  to  go  to  prison'\" \nthreaten institutional security); John Does 1-100 v. Boyd, 613 F. Supp. 1514, 1524 (D. Minn. \n1985) (“[T]he commingling of detainees does not mandate a finding that the defendants’ strip \nsearch policy is constitutional … any danger associated with commingling is minimized by the \nfact that a detainee’s arrest is an unplanned event. The danger of smuggling is therefore wholly \nunsubstantiated. Further, methods can be devised by defendants to minimize commingling”).  \nThe Plaintiffs should be given an opportunity to take discovery on the WVRJA’s justification for \nits strip search and delousing policies before a decision is rendered on the merits.    \n  Finally, the other cases that Defendants rely upon are unavailing.  Defendants’ reliance \nupon Turner v. Safely, 482 U.S. 78 (1987) and Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517 (1984), and other \n  11\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 23   Filed 11/17/09   Page 12 of 24 PageID #: 151\nsimilar prison regulation cases, is entirely misplaced.  These decisions address the rights of \nincarcerated, convicted individuals, not pretrial detainees.  Both Turner and Hudson cited to the \nBell decision with approval, and neither set aside Bell’s balancing test regarding strip searches.  \nSee, Allison v. GEO Group, 611 F. Supp.2d 433, 444-48 (E.D. Pa. 2009); Foote v. Spiegel, 995 \nF. Supp. 1347, 1359, n. 2 (D. Utah 1998) (“Because the Fourth Amendment test is already one of \nreasonableness  under  the  circumstances,  the  court  finds  that  the  Bell  factors,  formulated \nspecifically for use in the Fourth Amendment context, are more appropriate for use in this \n[blanket strip search case] than the factors promulgated in Turner.”)   One circuit has expressly \nheld that Turner does not apply to local correctional facilities,  see, Shain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d 56, \n65-66 (2d Cir. 2001), while another has found that, in the context of strip searches, the Turner \nfactors  must  still  be  balanced  by the  reasonableness  requirements  of  Bell.    See,  Jordan  v. \nGardner, 986 F.2d 1521, 1540 (9th Cir. 1993) (en banc).  This Court, when previously analyzing \na strip search claim brought by an inmate housed in a high security area of a state prison – a \nsituation far removed from that considered here – also held that the reasonableness test in Bell “is \nmore appropriate to the specific question whether [visual body cavity] searches violate the \nFourth Amendment.”  Skundor v. McBride, 280 F. Supp.2d 524, 526, n. 2 (S.D.W.Va. 2003).  \nThe Defendants have not come forward with one case, from any jurisdiction, that holds that \nBell’s reasonableness requirement, as applied to strip searches, is in any way limited by prison \nregulation cases.   \n          In sum, because Defendants’ blanket strip search policy violates the Fourth Amendment’s \nprohibition on unreasonable searches as interpreted by the Fourth Circuit in Logan, Defendants’ \nmotion to dismiss should be denied.   \n \n  12\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 23   Filed 11/17/09   Page 13 of 24 PageID #: 152\n  B.  Defendants’ Delousing Policy Is An Unreasonable Search That Violates    \n    Plaintiff’s Right To Privacy Protected By The Fourth Amendment And Other  \n    Constitutional Underpinnings.  \n \n  Defendants argue that their delousing procedure is permissible because it takes place \nconcomitantly with their blanket strip search procedure, which they contend to be permissible.  \nBut for the same reasons that Defendants’ blanket strip search procedure fails muster under the \nConstitution, so too does Defendants’ delousing procedure.  Further, Defendants’ delousing \nprocedure is an even more intrusive search and invasion of privacy than a visual cavity search \nbecause it involves the involuntary spraying of delousing solution upon detainees’ naked bodies, \nincluding  their  genitals,  regardless  of  whether  a  detainee  is  actually  harboring  lice.    See \nAmended Complaint, ¶ 27.  The Defendants have proffered almost no cogent argument to the \nCourt to justify this delousing procedure, other than relying on one easily distinguishable case.         \n  Defendants cite to Russell v. Richards, 384 F.3d 444 (7th Cir. 2004), as the “closest a \nCourt has come to considering” the issue of whether a blanket delousing policy comports with \nthe Constitution.  To the contrary, at least three other District Courts have considered blanket \ndelousing  policies  where  naked  detainees  are  sprayed  down  with  anti-lice  solution  like \nDefendants’  policy  here.    One  of  these  courts  condemned  the  delousing  policy  as \nunconstitutional, and the other two certified classes relating to the issue of blanket delousing, \nwithout yet passing judgment on liability.  See, Doan v. Watson, 168 F. Supp. 2d 932, 937 (S.D. \nInd. 2001) (holding that the blanket, naked, spraying-down “delousing procedure administered \nby  Defendants  in  the  Floyd  County  Jail  violates  the  Fourth  Amendment's  prohibition  of \nunreasonable searches” and granting summary judgment for the plaintiffs); Wilson v. County of \nGloucester,  256  F.R.D.  479,  486  (D.N.J.  2009)  (finding  that  “Plaintiffs  have  put  forth  a \nlegitimate question of law common to all proposed class members: whether requiring all newly \n  13\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 23   Filed 11/17/09   Page 14 of 24 PageID #: 153\nadmitted pretrial detainees to completely disrobe before a corrections officer-- either during a \nsupervised  shower  or  application  of  delousing  spray--  violates  federal  or  state  law.”); \nGwiazdowski  v.  County  of  Chester,  2009  WL  3448121,  *6  (E.D.  Pa.,  October  20,  2009) \n(“Defendant’s delousing policy specifically requires a visual inspection of the naked body to \ninspect for wounds and sores, and therefore is considered a strip search”).  The Plaintiffs also \nrespectfully suggest that the WVRJA’s delousing policy goes beyond violating Cantley’s rights \nand the rights of putative class members under the Fourth Amendment, and also violates their \nconstitutional  right  to  privacy.    See,  Griswold  v.  Connecticut,  381  U.S.  479,  485  (1965) \n(recognizing the “penumbral rights of privacy and repose”); Canady v. Boardman, 16 F.3d 183, \n185 (7th Cir. 1994) (“[O]ne of the clearest forms of degradation in Western Society is to strip a \nperson of his clothes,  The right to be free from strip searches and degrading body inspections is \nthus basic to the concept of privacy”).  Thus, there is ample authority for the Court to find that \nDefendants’ delousing policy is unconstitutional. \n      Further, the delousing procedure employed by Defendants here markedly differs from \npolicy at issue in Russell, which was described by the court as follows:   \nBefore entering the general population of the Johnson County jail, each incoming \ninmate is handed a small cup of Liceall brand delousing shampoo and is told to \napply it to his scalp and rinse it out while showering. No one at the jail monitors \nthe inmate to verify that he has used the shampoo as instructed, however. In fact, \nas far as the jail is concerned, any inmate may refuse to apply the shampoo, \nalthough inmates are not told that they have this right. \n \nRussell, 384 F.3d at 446 (emphasis added).   \n  In addition to the fact that Russell concerned a claim under the Fourteenth Amendment \nfor unwanted medical treatment, rather than the Fourth Amendment claims at issue here, there \nwas no allegation in Russell that the detainees were forced to disrobe in front of a corrections \nofficer.  Second, unlike in Russell, Plaintiff and the putative class members here are not merely \n  14\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 23   Filed 11/17/09   Page 15 of 24 PageID #: 154\nhanded a small cup of anti-lice shampoo and then left unsupervised to shower, with the apparent \noption to refuse to apply the shampoo.  Rather, Plaintiff and the putative class members were and \nare sprayed down with anti-lice solution, stand naked for a period of time while being observed \n“rubbing the solution into their hair, including their pubic hair,” and then are ordered to shower \nwithin full view of a corrections officer.  See Amended Complaint, ¶ 27; see also Defendants’ \nBrief at 3-4.  Finally, unlike the defendant in Russell, the Defendants here have failed to adduce \nany evidence whatsoever that the WVRJA has had lice infestation problems sufficiently severe \nto justify a blanket delousing policy.2     \n  Furthermore, if the Court chooses to analyze the delousing policy under the Fourth \nAmendment balancing test enunciated in Bell, the rights of pre-trial detainees relative to forced \ndelousing are even more compelling that their rights regarding strip searches.  The WVRJA’s \ndelousing policy involves corrections officers spraying a caustic substance on the genitals, head \nand buttocks of detainees, making them stand there with this solution on their bodies for a period \nof time, and then supervising them showering the delousing solution off of their privates, all in \nthe absence of any inspection or determination that an individual is actually infested with lice.  It \nis hard to imagine a more degrading procedure for someone charged with a minor crime, who \nhas likely not even seen a judge, then for them to be deloused like an animal; the justification for \nthis procedure should be highly compelling and grounded in medical necessity.  The Plaintiffs \nwill present proof to the Court, after having an opportunity to conduct discovery, to demonstrate \nthat there is no medical justification for requiring the delousing of all detainees absent a finding, \nmade by a medical professional, that a detainee is actually harboring lice.  The Plaintiffs will also \npresent proof to the Court that a one-time “Liceall” treatment sprayed on by a Corrections \n                                                           \n2 As detailed elsewhere herein, Plaintiff has had no opportunity to take discovery into the factual justification, if any, \nto substantiate the Defendants’ need to conduct blanket delousing on new pretrial detainees. \n  15\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 23   Filed 11/17/09   Page 16 of 24 PageID #: 155\nOfficer, without any effort to remove lice eggs from head or pubic hair, is a largely ineffective \ntreatment for someone infested with lice.   \n  Accordingly, because Defendants’ delousing procedure is the same as the delousing \nprocedure at issue in Doan, and an order of magnitude more intrusive and invasive than the \ndelousing procedure at issue in Russell¸ the court should deny Defendants’ motion to dismiss.   \n  C.  Whether Defendants Had Reasonable Suspicion to Strip Search Plaintiff Cantley   \n    Is Properly the Subject Of a Summary Judgment Motion, Not a Motion to Dismiss \n \n  Defendants contend that there was reasonable suspicion to strip search Plaintiff Cantley \nbecause of the nature of the offense with which he was charged, and his actions at the jail.  \nPlaintiff disagrees with these contentions and has alleged otherwise.  See Amended Complaint, \n¶¶ 38-43.   (alleging that “the allegations against Mr. Cantley did not involve a claim that he had \nharmed his wife, or anyone else, but rather that he was present in a location at which he was \nforbidden to be present,” and that “Plaintiff Cantley's arrest was void of any reasonable suspicion \nthat he harbored any weapons or contraband”).   \n  First and foremost, it is well-settled that a “district court may not resolve factual disputes \non Rule 12(b)(6) motion without converting motion into one for summary judgment under Rule \n56.”  Andrew v. Clark, 561 F.3d 261, 267 (4th Cir. 2009) (citing Bosiger v. U.S. Airways, 510 \nF.3d 442, 450 (4th Cir. 2007).  Because Plaintiff’s counsel have not had opportunity to take any \ndiscovery  into  the  circumstances  of  Mr.  Cantley’s  entry  into  the  Western  Regional  Jail, \nDefendants’ motion to dismiss should be denied.  This is especially true given that Mr. Cantley \nhas been admitted to the WVRJA’s custody for misdemeanor charges on several occasions \nduring the class period, Amended Complaint, ¶ 43, not just on the one occasion referenced by the \nDefendants in their motion papers.       \n  Second, Defendants have not contended that the corrections officer(s) who strip searched \n  16\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 23   Filed 11/17/09   Page 17 of 24 PageID #: 156\nand deloused Mr. Cantley even knew what Mr. Cantley was charged with when he entered the \njail.  Exhibits A, B and C to the Defendants’ motion papers provide no further information on \nthis point, as they appear devoid of any charging information for Mr. Cantley.  Because a \ndefendant  may  not  invent  a  post  hoc  justification  for  an  unconstitutional  strip  search, \nDefendants’ argument that the nature of Mr. Cantley’s alleged offense justified his strip search \nmust fail. See, Bizzarro v. Ocean County, 2009 WL 1617887, * 13 (D.N.J. June 9, 2009)  \n(“Defendants cannot create post-hoc rationales to manufacture justifications for conducting strip \nsearches”); Doe v. Calumet City, 754 F. Supp. 1211, 1220 (N.D. Ill. 1990) (defendant cannot \navoid liability by manufacturing post-hoc basis for strip searches which were conducted pursuant \nto indiscriminate and routine policy); Gonzalez v. City of Schenectady, 141 F. Supp.2d 304, 309 \n(N.D.N.Y. 2001) (effort to establish reasonable suspicion after admitting blanket strip searches \n“defies logic and, frankly, is absurd”).     \n  Finally, Defendants do not and cannot argue that Mr. Cantley’s alleged offense, or his \npurported belligerence upon entry to the jail, justified the delousing procedure that he underwent.  \nFor this reason alone, Defendants’ motion to dismiss should be denied.   \n  The Court should not rule upon whether the Defendants had reasonable suspicion to strip \nsearch Mr. Cantley until such time that Plaintiff has had opportunity to take discovery in this \nmatter. \n  D.  The Prison Litigation Reform Act’s Exhaustion Requirement Is Not A Bar To  \n    Plaintiff’s Claims. \n \nDefendants  argue  that  the  Complaint  should  be  dismissed  because  Plaintiff  has  not \nexhausted his administrative remedies as set forth in the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA).  \nHowever, the PLRA’s exhaustion requirement does not apply to Plaintiff’s claims since Plaintiff \nwas not incarcerated at the time that the Complaint was filed.  The Western District of North \n  17\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 23   Filed 11/17/09   Page 18 of 24 PageID #: 157\nCarolina has recently held that:   \nAn inmate who has been released from custody is no longer “incarcerated or \ndetained” as defined in § 1997e(h) and, therefore, does not qualify as a prisoner \nsubject to the exhaustion requirement of the PLRA. See e.g., Cofield v. Bowser, \n247 Fed. App’x 413, 414 (4th Cir. 2007)] (“Because [the plaintiff] was not a \nprisoner when he filed his complaint, the PLRA exhaustion requirement is not \napplicable to his § 1983 action.”); Nerness v. Johnson, 401 F.3d 874, 876 (8th \nCir.2005)  (“First,  [plaintiff]  was  not  subject  to  the  PLRA's  exhaustion \nrequirement because he was not a prisoner or otherwise incarcerated when he \nfiled his complaint .”); Norton v. City of Marietta, 432 F.3d 1145, 1150 (10th Cir. \n2005),] “[P]laintiff, who was not a prisoner confined in a jail, prison, or other \ncorrectional  facility  when  he  brought  suit,  did  not  have  to  exhaust  his \nadministrative remedies first.”); Ahmed v. Dragovich, 297 F.3d 201, 210 n. 10 (3d \nCir.2002) (“We note that every court of appeals to have considered the issue has \nheld that the PLRA does not apply to actions filed by former prisoners.”).  \n \nShembo v. Bailey, 2009 WL 129974, *2 (W.D.N.C. Jan. 20, 2009); see also Janes v. Hernandez, \n215 F.3d 541, 543 (5th Cir. 2000); Grieg v. Goord, 169 F.3d 165 (2d Cir.1999); Wilson v. \nHampton County, 2005 WL 2877725, *3 (D.S.C. Oct. 31, 2005) (“the exhaustion-of-remedies \nrequirement in the PLRA does not apply to plaintiffs who file § 1983 actions after being released \nfrom prison”).  See also, Kelsey v. County of Schoharie, 2005 WL 1972557, *3 (N.D.N.Y. \nAugust 5, 2005) (refusing to apply the PLRA to a strip search class action).  Thus, Defendants’ \nargument with regard to the PLRA is without merit.   \n  E.  The Eleventh Amendment And The Will Doctrine Do Not Bar Plaintiff’s Claims  \n    Against Director Miller In His Individual Capacity.   \n \nThe Defendants next argue that the Plaintiff’s claims against Defendant Miller are barred \nby both 11th Amendment to the United States Constitution and the rule that state officials, acting \nin their official capacities, are not ‘persons’ under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Defendants’ Brief at 18 \n(citing Will v. Mich. Dept. of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 109 (1989)).   The law on these issues is \nso well developed, and the Plaintiff’s Complaint so patently clear, that Defendants’ argument is \nlittle more than unnecessary filler.   \n  18\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 23   Filed 11/17/09   Page 19 of 24 PageID #: 158\n Although all of the case authority provided by the Defendants deals only with claims \nagainst  a  state  official  in  their  official  capacity,  rather  than  their  individual  capacity,  the \nDefendant apparently seeks a dismissal of all claims.  It is unclear whether this is an oversight on \nthe Defendants’ part, or if they are being deliberately vague in order to create confusion.  The \ncase law is clear that § 1983 suits seeking monetary damages are permissible against state \nofficials in their individual capacities, and the Defendants have not cited a single authority to the \ncontrary.  See Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, 23 (1991).  See also, Roach v. Burke, 825 F. Supp. \n116, 118 (N.D.W.Va. 1993) (“individuals may still be sued in their individual capacities even if \nthe  alleged  wrongdoing  was  conducted  while  in  performance  of  their  official  capacity”).    \nFurthermore,  although  claims  for  monetary  damages  against  state  officials  in  their  official \ncapacities,  and  state  agencies,  are  barred,  claims  for  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  are \nperfectly appropriate.  Will v. Mich. Dept. of State Police, 491 U.S. 71, n. 10 (1989); Davis v. \nGreene, 2009 WL 3064106, * 16 (S.D.W.Va., September 18, 2009) (“A state agency is not a \n“person” within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and can only be sued for injunctive relief”).  \nIronically, Will is the very case which the Defendants relied upon to make their arguments.  The \nPlaintiff conspicuously distinguished the “individual capacity” damages causes of action from \nthe declaratory and injunctive relief causes of action in his Complaint just to forgo unnecessary \nbriefing such as this.  Amended Complaint, First and Second Causes of Action, pp. 13-14 \n(stating claims pled against Director Miller in his “individual capacity”).  The Defendants’ \nspecious claims in this regard are not a basis for dismissal.     \n \n \n \n  19\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 23   Filed 11/17/09   Page 20 of 24 PageID #: 159\n  F.  Qualified Immunity Does Not Not Bar Plaintiff’s Claims Against Director Miller  \n    Because Plaintiff’s Right to Be Free Of Unreasonable Searches Was Clearly \n    Established, and It Was Not Objectively Reasonable For Director Miller    \n    To Believe That A Blanket Strip Search Policy Was Lawful, Especially Given His \n    Position Of Authority.   \n \n  Defendant Miller further contends that he is entitled to dismissal under the doctrine of \nqualified immunity, arguing that the “Plaintiff has failed to make any allegation that a particular \naction of the Defendant Terry L. Miller violated a right, privilege, or immunity secured to the \nPlaintiff.”  Defendants’ Brief at 19.  Other than this terse statement, the Defendants do not even \nset forth a basis for the application of qualified immunity. \n  The  Defendants  correctly  observe  that  “[q]ualified  good  faith  immunity  shields  a \ngovernmental official from liability if the officer’s conduct does not violate clearly established \nstatutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person in the same position would have \nknown.”  Defendants’ Brief at 18 (citing Harlow v. Gitzgerald (sic), 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982)).  \nHowever, the Defendants do not proceed to argue that Defendant Miller did not violate the \nPlaintiff’s “clearly established rights.”  Rather, the Defendants merely seem to argue that the \nPlaintiff  failed  to  plead  facts  sufficient  to  overcome  a  qualified  immunity  defense.    This \nargument is unavailing for several reasons, not the least of which is that since qualified immunity \nis an affirmative defense, it need not be addressed by the Plaintiff in his Complaint. \nIn Gomez v. Toledo, 466 U.S. 635, 635-36, 100 S. Ct. 1920, 64 L. Ed. 2d 572 (1980), the \nSupreme Court considered the issue of whether, in an action brought under § 1983 against a \npublic official whose position might entitle him to qualified immunity; a plaintiff must plead \nallegations in anticipation of the affirmative defense. The Gomez Court began its analysis by \nelucidating the distinction between a plaintiff’s cause of action under § 1983 and a claim of \nqualified immunity: \n  20\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 23   Filed 11/17/09   Page 21 of 24 PageID #: 160\n[T]wo -- and only two -- allegations are required in order to state a cause of action \nunder [§ 1983]. First, the plaintiff must allege that some person has deprived him \nof a federal right. Second, he must allege that the person who has deprived him of \nthat right acted under color of state or territorial law. \n \nId. at 640.   The Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint pleads both of these requirements, almost to the \npoint of redundancy.  Specifically, paragraphs 5, 21-37, and 46-52, address these issues in a clear \nand incontrovertible manner. \nThe Gomez Court observed that neither the language of § 1983 nor its legislative history \nsuggests that a plaintiff has the duty to plead facts relevant to a qualified immunity defense in \norder to state a claim. See id. at 639-40. Qualified immunity, explained the Court, is a defense \navailable to the government official in question, not a part of the plaintiff’s cause of action which \nhe must denigrate. Id. at 640. Citing to the Federal Rules, the Court stated that “[s]ince qualified \nimmunity is a defense, the burden of pleading it rests with the defendant.” Id. (citing Fed. R. Civ. \nP.  8(c)  (imposing  upon  the  defendant  the  burden  of  pleading  any  “matter  constituting  an \navoidance or affirmative defense”)). The Court concluded that there is “no basis for imposing on \nthe plaintiff an obligation to anticipate such a defense…” Id. at 640. \nAdditionally, as discussed in greater detail earlier in this Brief, the law regarding the \nunconstitutionality  of  blanket  strip  searches  of  pre-trial  misdemeanor  detainees  was  clearly \nestablished at the time of the Plaintiff’s detention.   Indeed, the 4th Circuit itself had already \ndecided this issue as far back as 1981.  Logan, 660 F.2d 1007 at 1013; see also Jones, 470 F. \nSupp. 2d  at 547-548 (“the right of those arrested for offenses not likely to involve weapons or \ncontraband to be free from strip searches without any individualized finding of reasonable \nsuspicion appears to be clearly established.” ) (citing Logan, 660 F.2d at 1013 (strip searching \nmust be reasonable under the circumstances and was not reasonable when done to arrestee whose \noffense was not likely to involve weapons or contraband); Amaechi v. West, 237 F.3d 356, 364 \n  21\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 23   Filed 11/17/09   Page 22 of 24 PageID #: 161\n(4th Cir. 2001) (\"because West had no reason to believe that Amaechi posed a danger to the \nofficers, and because Amaechi was arrested for a misdemeanor noise violation, West should \nhave  known  that  his  search  of  Amaechi  similarly  was  unjustified  and  therefore \nunconstitutional.\"); Abshire v. Walls, 830 F.2d 1277, 1279-80 (4th Cir. 1987) (citing Logan and \nstating \"the standard in this circuit for judging the constitutionality of a strip search of a pre-trial \ndetainee is firmly established\")).  Moreover, and even more specifically, “it seems clear that it \nwas not objectively reasonable for [Director Miller] to believe that a blanket strip search policy \nwas lawful, especially when [his] position of authority is considered.” Jones, 470 F. Supp. 2d at \n547-548 (citing Logan, 660 F.2d at 1013-14 (explaining that \"[a]n indiscriminate strip search \npolicy routinely applied to detainees [whose underlying offense is unlikely to involve weapons \nor contraband] cannot be constitutionally justified . . .\" and distinguishing the reasonableness of a \npolicy-setting sheriff having believed a policy to be constitutional from that of an implementing \ndeputy). \n  Finally, as evidenced in other strip search litigation, factual discovery may undermine \nany qualified immunity defense the Defendant may attempt to raise.  Practically speaking, \ncorrectional officials generally follow the developing law pertinent to their duties and are usually \naware of most seminal decisions.  It is quite likely that Defendant Miller was perfectly aware of \nthe numerous legal decisions holding that blanket strip search policies are unconstitutional, yet \ncontinued to employ those unconstitutional practices in West Virginia.  The Plaintiffs’ complaint \nstates as much.  Amended Complaint, ¶ 33 (policy promulgated “in bad faith and contrary to \nclearly established law”).  The Defendant further disputes the facts pertinent to the Plaintiff’s \narrest, detention and subsequent strip search.  This alone is sufficient grounds to deny the Motion \nto Dismiss at this stage.  See Dimeglio v. Haines, 45 F.3d 790 (4th Cir. 1995) (noting that in cases \n  22\n\nCase 3:09-cv-00758   Document 23   Filed 11/17/09   Page 23 of 24 PageID #: 162\nwhere there is a material dispute concerning an alleged violation of clearly-established law, the \nquestion of qualified immunity “cannot be resolved without discovery.”). \n \nV.  CONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, Defendants’ motion to dismiss should be denied in its entirety, \nespecially in the absence of appropriate discovery. \n  Respectfully submitted by: \n \n  /s Aaron Rihn \nDated: November 17, 2009      _______________________  \nAaron Rihn, Esquire \nROBERT PEIRCE & ASSOCIATES, P.C. \n2500 Gulf Tower \n707 Grant Street \nPittsburgh, PA 15219-1918 \n412.281.7229 \n \n            Elmer Robert Keach, III, Esquire \n            LAW OFFICES OF ELMER ROBERT \nKEACH, III, P.C. \n1040 Riverfront Center \n            Post Office Box 70 \n            Amsterdam, NY 12010         \n            518.434.1718 \n             \n            Gary E.
