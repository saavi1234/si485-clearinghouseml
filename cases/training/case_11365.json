The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, asked the court for damages, claiming that they were unconstitutionally held after posting bond violating the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.

This is  a civil action arising under 42  U .S.C.  ยง 1983.  The jurisdiction of \nthis Court is conferred by 28 U.S.C. ยง1343. \n2.  Plaintiffs Robert Harper is a resident of the Northern District of Illinois. \n3.  Defendants  are  the  Sheriff of Cook  County  and  Cook  County,  Illinois. \nThe  Sheriff is  sued  in  his  official  capacity  only;  the  County  is  joined \npursuant to  Carver v.  Sheriff of LaSalle  County,  324 F.3d  947  (7th  Cir. \n2003). \n4.  On or about September 30, 2005, plaintiff Robert Harper was taken to the \nCriminal Courts Building at 2650 South California A venue following  his \narrest without a warrant by a Chicago police officer. \n5.  At the criminal courts building, plaintiff appeared by remote viewing (\"TV \ncourt\"), beforce a judge who set bond and ordered that plaintiff be held in \nthe custody of defendant Sheriff pending the posting of bond. \n\nCase: 1:07-cv-02393 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/01/07 Page 2 of 3 PageID #:2\n- 2 -\n6.  Members of plaintiff's family  attended the bond hearing and immediately \nsought to post cash bond to obtain plaintiff's enlargement from custody. \n7.  In accordance with a policy and/or practice of defendant Sheriff that is  so \npermanent and well-settled that it  constitutes a custom or usage with the \nforce of law, plaintiff was required to submit to the processing required by \nthe Sheriff's policies of a person being admitted to the Cook County Jail \nwhile plaintiff's family members posted cash bond. This processing began \nwith  placement  into  an  overcrowded  and  unsanitary  animal  cage,  and \nincluded  a  chest  x-ray,  the  non-consensual  insertion  of  a  swab  into \nplaintiff's  penis,  the  non-consensual  taking  of blood,  and a  strip  search \nwhich was conducted in a manner calculated to embarrass and humiliate. \n8.  It has at all times relevant been the practice of the Sheriff of Cook County \nto  excuse  from  this  processing  persons  of  wealth,  clout,  or  political \ninfluence who, after bond has been set at  \"TV  court,\"  are ready,  willing, \nand able to post cash bond. \n9.  As the direct and proximate result of the above referred policy, plaintiff, \nand all others persons subjected to  the above referred policy,  was embar \nrassed, humiliated, unreasonably deprived of his liberty,  incured pain and \nsuffering,  and  was  deprived  of rights  secured  by  the  Fourth  and  Four \nteenth Amendments. \n10.  Plaintiffs bring this action for a class of all persons who, following his or \nher arrest without a warrant,  appeared on or after May  1,  2005  before a \njudge at  \"TV court\"  and,  while persons  acting  on behalf of the  arrestee \nsought  to  post  cash  bond,  was  required  to  submit  to  the  processing \nrequired by the Sheriff's policies of a person being admitted to  the Cook \nCounty Jail.  The proposed class satisfies each of the requirements of Rule \n\nCase: 1:07-cv-02393 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/01/07 Page 3 of 3 PageID #:3\n- 3 -\n23(a)  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure.  The  relief  sought  is \nappropriate  damages  for  each  person  subjected  to  the  policy  and  class \ncertification is appropriate under Rules 23(b)(3). \nII.  Plaintiff hereby demands trial by jury. \nWherefore plaintiff requests  that judgment be  entered  in his  favor  in  an \namount in excess of one hundred thousand dollars, that judgment be entered in \nfavor  of  the  proposed  class,  and  that  the  Court  grant  such  relief  for  each \nmember of the proposed class as may be appropriate. \nhi Kmif2i!=---\nKENNETH N.

      "text": "Case: 1:07-cv-02393 Document #: 43 Filed: 05/29/08 Page 1 of 7 PageID #:492\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nNORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS \nEASTERN DIVISION \nROBERT HARPER,  ) \n) \nPlaintiff,  )  No. 07 CV 2393 \n) \nv.  )  Judge John W. Darrah \n) \nSHERIFF OF COOK COUNTY  ) \nand COOK COUNTY, ILLINOIS  ) \n) \nDefendants.  ) \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER \nPlaintiff, Robert Harper,  filed  a class-action suit against Defendants,  Sheriff of Cook \nCounty and Cook County, Illinois (\"County Defendants\"), alleging that the Defendant Sheriff \nviolated his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights by requiring him to participate in certain \nintake procedures at the Cook County Jail.  Presently pending before the Court is Plaintiffs \nMotion to Certify the Case as a Class Action. \nBACKGROUND \nA  reading  of Plaintiffs  Complaint  supports  the  following  summary  of the  alleged \nconduct of the parties. \nOn or about September 30, 2005, following his arrest, Harper appeared in Central Bond \nCourt.  Bond was set by the presiding judge; and Harper was ordered to be held in the Sheriffs \ncustody, pending the posting of bond.  Members of Harper's family were present at the bond \nhearing and immediately sought to post cash bond while Harper underwent the intake procedures \nat Cook County Jail.  These procedures included Harper's placement in a cell, followed by a \nchest x-ray, the non-consensual insertion of a swab into the plaintiffs penis, the non-consensual \n\nCase: 1:07-cv-02393 Document #: 43 Filed: 05/29/08 Page 2 of 7 PageID #:493\nโข \ntaking of blood, and a strip search conducted in a humiliating manner.  It is the practice of the \nDefendant  Sheriff to  excuse  from  these  procedures  persons  of wealth,  clout,  or  political \ninfluence who, after bond has been set, are ready, willing, and able to post cash bond.  As a \nresult of being subjected to the Defendant Sheriffs intake procedures, Harper, along with others \nin his putative class, are embarrassed and humiliated and incurred pain and suffering. \nANALYSIS \nAllegations  made  in  support  of class  certification  are  considered  true.  Hardin  v. \nHarshbarger, 814 F.  Supp. 703, 706 (N.D. Ill. 1993).  As a general matter, the court does not \nexamine the merits of the case.  Retired Chicago Police Ass 'n v.  City of Chicago, 7 F.3d 584, \n598 (7th Cir.  1993) (Retired Police).  However, a court \"may look beyond the pleadings to \ndetermine whether the requirements of Rule 23 have been satisfied.\"  Dhamer v. Bristol-Myers \nSquibb Co.,  183 F.R.D. 520, 529-30 (N.D. Ill 1998) (citing Castano v. American Tobacco Co., \n84  F.3d  734,  744  (5th  Cir.  1996)).  The  party  seeking  certification  bears  the  burden  of \nestablishing that class certification is proper.  See Trull v. Plaza Assoc., 1998 WL578173 (N.D. \nIll. Sept. 3, 1998). \nTo receive class certification, a party must satisfy all four elements of Rule 23(a), which \ninclude: numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation.  Fed. R.  Civ. P. \n23(a).  The party must also satisfy at least one of the three provisions under Rule 23(b). \nPlaintiff seeks to certify the following class: \nAll persons processed into the Cook County Jail on and after \nMay 2, 2005, while that person, or someone acting on his (or her) \nbehalf, sought to post cash bond. \n2 \n\nCase: 1:07-cv-02393 Document #: 43 Filed: 05/29/08 Page 3 of 7 PageID #:494\nNumerosity \nRule 23(a)(l) requires that the class be so numerous that joinder of all the members is \nimpracticable.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(l).  Plaintiff need not demonstrate the exact number of class \nmembers so long as a conclusion is apparent from good-faith estimates (Peterson v. H & R Block \nTax Servs., 174 F.R.D. 78, 81 (N.D. Til. 1997)); and the court is entitled to make \"common sense \nassumptions\" in order to support a finding of numerosity (Grossman v.  Waste Management, Inc., \n100 F.R.D. 781,785 (N.D. Ill. 1984)). \nPlaintiff projects the number of potential class members to be over 5,700 persons, based \non an average of five persons' being released on bail the same day that they were processed into \nthe jail as  calculated by 3,558  males'  being released  on bail  the  same  day that they were \nprocessed into the jail for the time period of May 2, 2005 through January 25, 2007. \nDefendants  argue  that  Plaintiffs potential  class  is  merely  speculative  because  some \nindividuals  may have been released for  other reasons,  and some of the  individuals  may be \nmembers of two other class actions brought against the same Defendants.1  In response, Plaintiff \nhas provided the sworn declarations of fifteen persons who would be included in the proposed \nclass.  Plaintiff has sufficiently demonstrated that the number of plaintiffs would be so numerous \nthat joinder of all the members is impracticable. \n1Jackson v. Sherif! of Cook County, 06 C 493, class of\"All male prisoners at the Cook County \nJail who, on or after January 27, 2004, were subjected to the non-consensual insertion of a swab \ninto his penis as part of his admission to the jail.\"  Young v.  County ofC  ook, 06 C 552, two \nclasses defined as: \"(I) all males who were subjected to a strip search and/or a visual body cavity \nsearch as new detainees at the Cook County Jail on or after January 30, 2004; and (2) all persons \ncharged only with misdemeanor or lesser offenses not involving drugs or weapons who were \nsubjected to a strip search and/or a body cavity search as new detainees at the Cook County Jail \non or after January 30, 2004.\" \n3 \n\nCase: 1:07-cv-02393 Document #: 43 Filed: 05/29/08 Page 4 of 7 PageID #:495\nCommonality and Typicality \nCommonality exists if the class members share common questions of law or fact.  The \nrequirement  is  usually satisfied when  a common  nucleus  of operative  facts  unites  a  class. \nRosario v.  Livaditis, 963  F.2d 1013,  1018 (7th Cir.  1992) (Rosario).  The presence of some \nfactual variations among the class members does not defeat commonality, so long as there is at \nleast one question of law or fact common to the class.  Rosario, F.2d at 1017. \nThe  typicality  requirement  of Rule  23(a)(3)  is  closely  related  to  the  commonality \nrequirement of Rule 23(a)(2).  Ruiz v.  Stewart Associates, Inc., 171  F.R.D. 238, 242 (N.D. Ill. \n1997).  A plaintiffs claim is typical if it arises from the same event or practice or course of \naction that gives rise to the claims of other class members and if his or her claims are based on \nthe same legal theory.  Rosario, 963 F.2d at 1018. \nPlaintiff argues that the class claims share common questions of fact and law: \n(1) whether there is any legitimate need to assign a jail identification number to any arrestee who \nis ready, willing, and able (either individually or through a friend or family) to post bond; \n(2) whether Defendants refuse to accept cash bond until late in the afternoon, resulting in several \nhours of detention for an arrestee that is ready, willing, and able to post cash bond; \n(3) whether persons with wealth, clout, or political influence are allowed to immediately post \nbond with the assignment of a jail identification number and without being processed into the \njail; (4) whether there is a lawful justification for the lengthy continued detention after bond has \nbeen posted; ( 5) whether the Defendants apply or enforce the policy alleged in the Complaint \nand does that policy result in a deprivation of rights secured by the Fourth Amendment; and \n4 \n\nCase: 1:07-cv-02393 Document #: 43 Filed: 05/29/08 Page 5 of 7 PageID #:496\n(6)  whether the Defendants  apply a different policy to persons of wealth,  clout, or political \ninfluence and does that disparate treatment amount to the denial of equal protection under the \nlaw. \nDefendants' arguments present questions of fact and law that go to the merits regarding \nthe elements of commonality and typicality.  A court does not examine the merits of a claim \nwhen determining if certification is proper.  See Retired Police, 7 F.3d at 598. \nDefendants also argue that typicality does not exist because of particular facts as to each \ndetainee - for example, the type of bond that was set, the differences in the intake process for \nfemale detainees, and possible defenses as to each member's claim.  Defendants' argument is not \npermissive because the proposed class includes only those individuals subject to  the claimed \noffensive  procedures  while  remaining  in  custody  although  able  to  post  a  cash  bond. \nAccordingly, Plaintiff has satisfied both the commonality and typicality requirements.  See \nKeele  v.  Wexler,  149  F.3d 589,  594 (7th Cir.  1998)  (\"Common nuclei  of fact  are  typically \nmanifest where . . . the defendants have engaged in standardized conduct towards members of \nthe proposed class ....\" ). \nAdequacy ofR  epresentation \nThe class representatives must \"fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\" \nFed.  R.  Civ.  P.  23(a).  In determining adequacy of class representation, the court considers \nwhether {I) any conflicts of interest exist between the named plaintiffs and the class members \nand (2) the named plaintiffs' counsel will adequately protect the interests of the class.  Gaspar v. \nLinvatec Corp., 167 F.R.D. 51, 58 (N.D. Ill. 1996). \n5 \n\nCase: 1:07-cv-02393 Document #: 43 Filed: 05/29/08 Page 6 of 7 PageID #:497\n' \nDefendants argue that Harper is not an adequate representative party because he cannot \nstate an actionable claim.  The Court has previously held that Plaintiff sufficiently pled a cause \nof action, and the Court will not address the merits of Plaintiffs specific claim at this time. \nDefendants  do  not challenge the  adequacy of class counsel, and class counsel has  extensive \nexperience litigating class actions. \nRule 23(b)(l)(3) \nPlaintiff seeks class certification under Rule 23(b)(l )(3).  Certification under \nRule  23(b)(l)(3)  is  appropriate  if \"questions  of law  or  fact  common  to  class  members \npredominate  over  any  questions  affecting  only  individual  members\"  and  \"a class  action  is \nsuperior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.\"  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 23(b)(J)(3). \nAs discussed above, Plaintiff has established common questions of law and fact as to the \nclass.  Defendants again argue that individual issues predominate over any common questions of \nlaw or fact- for example, the detainee's history, the amount of bond, and whether the individual \nproceeded through receiving procedures.  Defendants have not demonstrated that these issues are \nmaterial to defeat the certification of the proposed class.  The individual issues that Defendants \nargue are predominant are  not material  as  to  the common questions of whether there is any \nlegitimate need to assign a jail identification to any arresstee who is ready, willing and able to \npost cash bond or whether Defendants permit persons of wealth, clout or political influence to \npost bond without being assigned a jail identification number and without being processed into \nthe jail. \n6 \n\nCase: 1:07-cv-02393 Document #: 43 Filed: 05/29/08 Page 7 of 7 PageID #:498\nโข \n' \n' \nDefendants also argue that certifying a class action in the instant case is not a superior \nmethod of adjudication because the instant class would conflict with and overlap with other class \nactions.  However, Jackson, 06 C 493, which was recently settled, involved sexual-transmitted \ndisease testing of males processed into the jail; and Young, 06 C 552, which is presently awaiting \ntrial, challenged various aspects of the jail's strip search policies and do not resolve the claims \nasserted here. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Plaintiffs Motion to CertifY Case as  a Class Action is \ngranted.  However,  Plaintiffs proposed  class  definition  is  too  broad,  appearing  to  include \nindividuals that do not fall within the claims set forth in Plaintiffs Complaint - persons who \nwhere subject to, and required to submit to, the intake procedures of Cook County Jail on or after \nMay 2, 2005, while that person, or someone acting on his or her behalf, was willing and able to \npost cash bond.  Accordingly, Plaintiff is to file an amended class definition within fourteen days \nof this order.

The  district  court  certified\nHarperโs class, a decision that the Sheriff appeals. We\nagree with the Sheriff that this is not an appropriate case\nfor  class  disposition  and  vacate  the  decision  of  the\ndistrict court granting class certification.\nI.  BACKGROUND\nHarper was arrested by a Chicago police officer on the\nevening  of  September  29,  2005.  The  next  day,  he  was\nbrought before a judge around 1:00 p.m. for a probable\ncause hearing. The judge found probable cause, set bond\nat  $15,000,  and  remanded  Harper to the  Sheriffโs  cus-\ntody.  Harper  claims  that  his  wife  attended  the\nprobable cause hearing and immediately sought to post\ncash  bond,  but  was  not  permitted  to  post  bond  until\nsometime  after  4:00  p.m.  Harper  was  released  from\nthe Sheriffโs custody around 11:00 p.m.\nWhen a detainee returns to the Cook County Jail after\na  probable  cause  hearing,  he  is  placed  in  a  bull  pen\nand begins to be processed into the jail. This involves\nassigning the detainee an identification number, taking\nhis  picture  and  fingerprints,  collecting  any  property\ncarried by the detainee, conducting a personal history\ninterview, performing a psychiatric screening, assigning\nthe detainee to a division within the jail, conducting a\nmedical examination, and a strip search.\nFamily members or friends who want to post bond for\na detainee do so, not with the Sheriff, but with the Office\nof the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County. The\n\nCCaassee: :1C 0:a08s7-e3-c:4 v01-830- 23  34  91 D33 o D c o u c mDueomncetu:n m0t e0#n7: t16: 1522 4F9 i 4l e 6 d 1F:5 1il e 1 d / 1:  F30/i9l0e/90d 8:P 1/a21g0/e10 293/  2 o  0f   01P91a   gP  e a sPg:e a1IgD1e s#:: 51511\nNo. 08-3413 3\nSheriffโs  policy  directs  that  โ[i]nmates  who  have  their\nbond posted while going through the intake process are\nmoved ahead of the other inmates in order to speed up\ntheir release . . . . In some instances, the psychiatric inter-\nview  and  the  medical  examination  are  eliminated.โ\nBefore releasing a detainee, the Sheriff takes a number\nof steps to ensure that he is releasing the right person.\nThis  process  includes  checking  the  detaineeโs  photo-\ngraph, comparing the detaineeโs fingerprints with those\ntaken  during  the  intake  procedure,  and  requiring  the\ndetainee to provide answers to personal questions that\nwere asked during the prior personal history interview\nthat only the detainee should know.\nHarper brought this action to challenge his detention\nand treatment in the jail. In his complaint, Harper ex-\nplained  that  he  โwas  required  to  submit  to  the\nprocessing required by the Sheriffโs policies of a person\nbeing  admitted  to  the  Cook  County  Jail  while  plain-\ntiffโs family members posted cash bond.โ He went on to\ndescribe the processing, which โbegan with placement\ninto an overcrowded and unsanitary animal cage, and\ninclude a chest x-ray, the non-consensual insertion of a\nswab into plaintiffโs penis [to test for STDs], the non-\nconsensual  taking  of  blood,  and  a  strip  search  which\nwas  conducted  in  a  manner  calculated  to  embarrass\nand humiliate.โ\nIn  his  motion  to  certify  the  case  as  a  class  action,\nHarper  sought  to  represent  โ[a]ll  persons  who  were\nprocessed into the Cook County Jail on and after May 2,\n2005  while  persons  acting  on  behalf  of  the  arrestee\n\nCCaassee: :1C 0:a08s7-e3-c:4 v01-830- 23  34  91 D33 o D c o u c mDueomncetu:n m0t e0#n7: t16: 1522 4F9 i 4l e 6 d 1F:5 1il e 1 d / 1:  F30/i9l0e/90d 8:P 1/a21g0/e10 294/  2 o  0f   01P91a   gP  e a sPg:e a1IgD1e s#:: 51512\n4 No. 08-3413\nsought to post cash bond.โ He later changed his proposed\nclass definition to โ[a]ll persons processed into the Cook\nCounty Jail on and after May 2, 2005 while that person,\nor  someone  acting  on  his  (or  her)  behalf,  sought  to\npost  cash  bond.โ  The  district  court  granted  Harperโs\nmotion to certify the case as a class action, but found that\nHarperโs proposed class definition was too broad and\nordered  him  to  provide  a  new  class  definition  within\nfourteen  days.  We  granted  the  Sheriffโs  petition  to\nappeal  from  the  order  granting  class  certification  ac-\ncording to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f).\nII.  DISCUSSION\nTo certify a class, a district court must find that each\nrequirement  of  Rule  23(a)  (numerosity,  commonality,\ntypicality,  and  adequacy  of  representation)  is  satisfied\nas well as one subsection of Rule 23(b). โFailure to meet\nany of the Ruleโs requirements precludes class certifica-\ntion.โ Arreola v. Godinez, 546 F.3d 788, 794 (7th Cir. 2008).\nIn  this  case,  Harper  claimed,  and  the  district  court\nagreed,  that  his  class  action  satisfied  Rule  23(a)  and\nRule  23(b)(3)  (predominance  of  common  issues  and\nsuperiority of the class action format). On appeal,  the\nSheriff claims that none of the Rule 23(a) prerequisites\nfor  class  certification  were  met  and  that  Harperโs\nproposed class also failed to meet the requirements of\nRule 23(b)(3), so the district court should have denied\nclass certification. We review a district courtโs decision\nto certify a class for an abuse of discretion. Arreola, 546\nF.3d at 794.\n\nCCaassee: :1C 0:a08s7-e3-c:4 v01-830- 23  34  91 D33 o D c o u c mDueomncetu:n m0t e0#n7: t16: 1522 4F9 i 4l e 6 d 1F:5 1il e 1 d / 1:  F30/i9l0e/90d 8:P 1/a21g0/e10 295/  2 o  0f   01P91a   gP  e a sPg:e a1IgD1e s#:: 51513\nNo. 08-3413 5\nA. Jurisdiction\nBefore getting to the substance of this case, we address\na jurisdictional issue. Rule 23(f) states that โ[a] court of\nappeals may permit an appeal from an order granting\nor denying class-action certification under this rule if a\npetition for permission to appeal is filed . . . within 10 days\nafter  the  order  is  entered.โ  The  Sheriff  followed  this\nprocedure and we permitted the appeal. However, Harper\nclaims  that  the  district  courtโs  order  was  not  the\nappealable order contemplated by Rule 23(f) because it\ndid not define the class as required by Rule 23(c)(1)(B),\nand that, consequently, we do not have jurisdiction to\nconsider the Sheriffโs appeal. Harper is correct that the\ndistrict court did not define the class as it should have,\nbut that does not deprive us of jurisdiction.\nThere is no doubt that the district court certified the\nclass. Its order states: โPlaintiffโs Motion to Certify Case\nas a Class Action is granted.โ This allowed the Sheriff\nto  seek  permission  to  file  an  interlocutory  appeal.\nHarper argues that the Sheriff was required to wait until\na new class definition was submitted. But Harper was\ncharged  with  that  responsibility  and  the  Sheriff  had\nonly ten days in which to seek permission to appeal. The\nSheriff waited as long as he could and acted properly.1\n1 The Sheriff submitted his Rule 23(f) request to file an inter-\nlocutory appeal on the same day that Harperโs amended class\ndefinition  was  due.  Because  Rule  6  directs  that  weekends\nare not counted when a time period is less than eleven days,\n(continued...)\n\nCCaassee: :1C 0:a08s7-e3-c:4 v01-830- 23  34  91 D33 o D c o u c mDueomncetu:n m0t e0#n7: t16: 1522 4F9 i 4l e 6 d 1F:5 1il e 1 d / 1:  F30/i9l0e/90d 8:P 1/a21g0/e10 296/  2 o  0f   01P91a   gP  e a sPg:e a1IgD1e s#:: 51514\n6 No. 08-3413\nFurthermore,  the  propriety  of  resolving  Harperโs  pro-\nposed class issues through the class action format, which\ngoes  to  the  heart  of  this  appeal,  is  not  dependent  on\nthe subtleties of the class definition.\nB. Class Certification\nNext, we must decipher what Harper is complaining\nabout  in  order  to  determine  whether  his  claim  is\nsuitable for disposition through the class action format.\nAs the Sheriff notes, Harperโs claim has been a moving\ntarget  throughout  this  litigation.  Harperโs  actual  com-\nplaint makes it seem that he is seeking to challenge the\nspecific  intake  procedures  utilized  by  the Sheriff  such\nas  the  strip  search  and  STD  test.  Harperโs  deposition\ntestimony confirms that he was offended by these two\nprocedures.  But  Harper  assured  us  multiple  times  at\noral argument that this case is not about searching and\nswabbing, and we take him at his word. If these were\nhis claims, this case would be duplicative of two other\nclass actions challenging these procedures at the Cook\nCounty Jail. Young v. County of Cook, 06 C 552 (strip search);\nJackson v. Sheriff of Cook County, 06 C 493 (STD testing).2\n1 (...continued)\nten days for the Sheriff in this case was the same as fourteen\ndays for Harper.\n2 The complaint also mentions a chest x-ray and blood draw\nas part of the processing procedures. But Harperโs brief ac-\nknowledges that he had โno problemโ with these two proce-\ndures.\n\nCCaassee: :1C 0:a08s7-e3-c:4 v01-830- 23  34  91 D33 o D c o u c mDueomncetu:n m0t e0#n7: t16: 1522 4F9 i 4l e 6 d 1F:5 1il e 1 d / 1:  F30/i9l0e/90d 8:P 1/a21g0/e10 297/  2 o  0f   01P91a   gP  e a sPg:e a1IgD1e s#:: 51515\nNo. 08-3413 7\nFailing to take issue with any particular intake proce-\ndure, Harper is left with a claim that the Sheriff is uncon-\nstitutionally  holding  detainees  after  bond  has  been\nposted.3  But  the  constitutionality  of  this  detention\ndepends on whether the length of the delay between the\ntime  the  Sheriff  was  notified  that  bond  had  been\nposted and the time that the detainee was released was\nreasonable in any given case. See Chortek v. City of Mil-\nwaukee, 356 F.3d 740, 747 (7th Cir. 2004) (delay in process-\ning is actionable if unreasonable). That is an individual\nissue that will depend on how long each detainee was\nheld  after  bond  was  posted  and  what  justifications\nthere might be for the delay on that particular day or\nโ\nfor  that  particular  detainee the  time  of  day,  whether\nthe  jail  was  processing  an  unusually  large  number  of\ndetainees at that time, whether other events occurring\nat the jail legitimately slowed processing times, whether\nthe  detaineeโs  lack  of  cooperation  delayed  processing,\netc. See Lewis v. OโGrady, 853 F.2d 1366, 1370 (7th Cir. 1988)\n(what is a reasonable time for detaining prisoner after\ngrounds  for  detention  have  ceased  depends  on  facts\n3 This gives Harper the benefit of the doubt. In some places, his\nbrief claims that detainees should not be processed into the\njail  when  a  family  member  is  ready,  willing,  and  able  to\npost bond. But bond is posted at the Clerkโs office; Harper\ndoes not explain how the Sheriff is to blame for any delay a\nfamily  member  might  experience  in  being  allowed  to\nactually post bond with the Clerk and the Sheriff cannot be\nexpected  to  forego  processing  based  on  a  detaineeโs  as-\nsurances that bond will be posted soon.\n\nCCaassee: :1C 0:a08s7-e3-c:4 v01-830- 23  34  91 D33 o D c o u c mDueomncetu:n m0t e0#n7: t16: 1522 4F9 i 4l e 6 d 1F:5 1il e 1 d / 1:  F30/i9l0e/90d 8:P 1/a21g0/e10 298/  2 o  0f   01P91a   gP  e a sPg:e a1IgD1e s#:: 51516\n8 No. 08-3413\npresented in each case). Liability, to say nothing of dam-\nages,  would  need  to  be  determined  on  an  individual\nbasis.  Thus,  common  issues  do  not  predominate  over\nindividual  issues,  making  this  case  inappropriate  for\nclass disposition. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).4\nHarper counters that a common issue predominates:\nwhether  it  is  reasonable  to  assign  a  jail  identification\nnumber to a detainee before allowing him to be released\non  bond.  But  claiming  that  an  issue  predominates\ndoes not make it so. Harper is trying to focus the class\ncertification  discussion  around  an  issue  that  is  not\ncentral to the litigation. See Amchem Products, Inc. v. Wind-\nsor,  521  U.S.  591,  624-25  (1997)  (basic  fact  that  all\nmembers  of  proposed  class  were  exposed  to  asbestos\nwas  insufficient  to  satisfy  predominance  requirement\nwhere  greater  number  of  significant  individual  issues\nexisted);  see  also  Hyderi  v.  Washington  Mut.  Bank,  FA,\n4 Harper also attempts to bring this action on behalf of individ-\nuals who were required to undergo certain processing proce-\ndures  before  being  allowed  to  post  bond  themselves.  It\nis  questionable  as  to  whether  Harper  can  represent  these\nindividuals since he did not attempt to post bond himself and\nso his claim is likely not typical of that portion of the pur-\nported class that posted bond themselves. See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n23(a)(3).  Regardless  of  this  typicality  concern,  the  reason-\nableness  of  the  delay  between  a  detainee  informing  the\nSheriff of his desire to post bond and the detaineeโs release\nremains an individual issue to be determined according to\nthe length of the delay and the conditions and exigencies of\nthe jail as they existed on that particular day.\n\nCCaassee: :1C 0:a08s7-e3-c:4 v01-830- 23  34  91 D33 o D c o u c mDueomncetu:n m0t e0#n7: t16: 1522 4F9 i 4l e 6 d 1F:5 1il e 1 d / 1:  F30/i9l0e/90d 8:P 1/a21g0/e10 299/  2 o  0f   01P91a   gP  e a sPg:e a1IgD1e s#:: 51517\nNo. 08-3413 9\n235  F.R.D.  390,  403  (N.D.

The  fact  that  the  Sheriff\nassigned  Harper  an  identification  number  cannot  be\nwhat  caused  Harper  the  embarrassment,  humiliation,\nunreasonable  deprivation  of  liberty,  and  pain  and\nsuffering described in his complaint.\nIf assigning identification numbers is the predominant\nissue in this case, then Harper would be arguing that it\nis  unconstitutional  to  give  detainees,  who  have  been\nremanded to the custody of the Sheriff to keep until trial\nor  until  bond  is  posted,  an  identification  number,  re-\ngardless  of  the  amount  of  time  it  takes  to  assign  the\nnumber and ultimately release the detainee. The Sheriff\nprocesses approximately 300 new detainees into the jail\nevery day and he must maintain some system of keeping\ntrack of who has been committed to, and released from,\nhis  custody.  There  is  nothing  unconstitutional  about\nassigning  an  identification  number  to  a  detainee  who\nhas been remanded to the custody of the Sheriff, unless\nit takes an unreasonable amount of time or is done in\nsome  unreasonable  manner.  And,  as  we  just  stated,\nthose are individual issues.\nWe have one last matter to resolve. Harper makes an\nequal  protection  claim  that  individuals  with  wealth,\n\nCCasaes:e 1:C :00a87s--e3c:4v 01-0832- 3 3 4 9 1 3D3 Do  co  uc  muDmeoncetun: mt0 #e0:n7 6t1:5 12 2F49i l 4e  6d  1:F 51il 1e  /d 1 : 3 F0/0i9le9/0d P8: a1/2g10e/10 1290/ 2   o 0 f 0 P19a1  g  P e  asPg: ae1gI1Des #: :15158\n10 No. 08-3413\nclout, or political influence are not required to undergo\nthe Sheriffโs intake procedures, but are allowed to im-\nmediately post bond (individually or through a family\nmember)  and  be  released  from  the  Sheriffโs  custody.\nHarper  admitted  that  he  was  not  treated  differently\nfrom anyone he observed in the jail; to support his equal\nprotection  claim,  Harper  obtained  an  affidavit  from  a\npolice officer who was arrested and claimed that after\nhis  hearing  he  was  not  placed  into  a  bull  pen  or\nprocessed  into  the  jail,  but  was  released  immediately\nafter the hearing when his wife posted bond. The officer\nclaimed that this is common treatment for persons with\nclout.\nIt is easy to understand why police officers would not\nbe placed in a bull pen with other detainees for the safety\nof the officers. The Sheriffโs written policy states that one\nreason to separate a detainee is his need for protective\ncustody. But either way, class action disposition is not\na  superior  method  of  litigating  this  claim. See  Fed.  R.\nCiv.  P.  23(b)(3).  Harper  is  not  interested  in  a  large\ndamage  award  (he  claimed  at  oral  argument  that  he\nwould have brought this case as a Rule 23(b)(2) action\nfor an injunction if he had standing to do so), and his\ndesire  to  prove  the  existence  and  illegality  of  the\nSheriffโs  discriminatory  practice  can  be  satisfied  in  an\nindividual  suit  without  the  management  issues  of  a\nclass  action.  It  would  be  better  to  litigate  this  claim\nwith Harperโs other individual claims.\n\nCCasaes:e 1:C :00a87s--e3c:4v 01-0832- 3 3 4 9 1 3D3 Do  co  uc  muDmeoncetun: mt0 #e0:n7 6t1:5 12 2F49i l 4e  6d  1:F 51il 1e  /d 1 : 3 F0/0i9le9/0d P8: a1/2g10e/10 1291/ 2   o 0 f 0 P19a1  g  P e  asPg: ae1gI1Des #: :15159\nNo. 08-3413 11\nIII.
