Williams, Esquire, Williams Cuker \nBerezofsky, brings this suit to recover for violations of his federal and state civil rights, as \nfollows: \nPARTIES \n1.  Plaintiff, Anthony Fernandez, is a current inmate at the Northampton County \nPrison (hereinafter, \"NCP\") in Easton, Northampton County, in the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania; he was incarcerated at NCP on or about December 31, 2006 and remains there at \nthe present time. While incarcerated at NCP, Mr. Fernandez has been and is completely \ndependent upon Defendants for his care and well-being. \n2.  Defendant Northampton County is a municipal corporation of the Commonwealth \nof Pennsylvania. \n3.  At all relevant times, Defendant, Prime Care Medical, Inc., (hereinafter, \"Prime \nCare\"), was and is a Pennsylvania Corporation which has been under contract with Northampton \nCounty to provide medical care and services to inmates at the Northampton County Prison, \nincluding Mr. Fernandez. \n4.  Upon information and belief, at all relevant times Defendant, Dr. William \nSprague, was a physician who played a role in overseeing Mr. Fernandez' treatment on behalf of \nPRIME CARE and Northampton County while Mr. Fernandez was incarcerated at Northampton \nCounty Prison. \n5.  Upon information and belief, at all relevant times Defendant, Dr. Victoria \nGessner, was a physician who played a role in overseeing Mr. Fernandez' treatment on behalf of \n\nCase 5:09-cv-00320-TMG   Document 1   Filed 01/22/09   Page 7 of 22\nPRIME CARE and Northampton County, while Mr. Fernandez was incarcerated at NCP. \n6.  At all relevant times, Defendant Todd Haskins, RN, CCHP was and/or is the \nCorrectional Healthcare Solutions Director, who was and is responsible for the overall operation \nof the prison's healthcare services.  He is sued in his individual and official capacities. \n7.  At all relevant times, Defendant Todd Buskirk served as the Director of \nCorrections and the former Warden of the Northampton County Prison, and was responsible for \nthe overall operation of the prison.  He is sued in his individual and official capacities. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n8.  Jurisdiction in this Court is asserted under the provisions of28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and \n1343.  This Court has Supplemental Jurisdiction of Plaintiff s state law claims pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 1367(a). \n9.  Venue is appropriately laid in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1391(b) in that the \nactions complained of took place within the District, the Defendants have carried on business \nwithin the District, and at least one Defendant resides within the District. \nFACTUAL ALLEGA nONS ON THE MERITS \n10.  Northampton County Prison (\"NCP\") has a history of inhumane conditions and \nrecklessly indifferent administration and staffing. \n11.  As a result, the prison has become a breeding ground for disease. \n12.  Due to Defendants' actions and inactions over the past years, the prison has \nexperienced repeated outbreaks of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (hereinafter, \n\"MRS A\"), a potentially deadly bacterial infection that is resistant to certain antibiotics. \n13.  According to the United States Department of Health and Human Services, \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, MRSA infections occur in otherwise healthy people. \n\nCase 5:09-cv-00320-TMG   Document 1   Filed 01/22/09   Page 8 of 22\n14.  MRSA often first appears as a pimple or boil which can become red, swollen, and \nextremely painful; as it advances, the boils often have pus or other drainage and result in the \nformation of a mass below the surface of the skin. \n15.  Drainage of skin boils or abscesses requires the attention of a healthcare provider. \n16.  Once a MRS A boil drains and the mass is removed, a hole is left behind and \nbecomes a scar which deforms the affected area. \n17.  More serious infections may cause pneumonia, bloodstream infections, surgical \nwound infections, and death. \n18.  Factors associated with the spread of MRS A skin infections include exposure to \ncontaminated items and surfaces, crowded living conditions, exposure to dirty and unsanitary \nliving environments, and openings in the skin such as cuts and abrasions. \nPrison Conditions \n19.  At all relevant times, the conditions of the prison have been filthy and \novercrowded, creating a breeding ground for diseases such as MRSA. \n20.  As discussed herein, Defendants have knowingly failed to maintain sanitary \nconditions throughout the prison, including the medical unit, causing the MRSA outbreaks and \nPlaintiff's associated inj uries. \n21.  Defendants did not clean the inmates' cells or blankets, did not allow adequate \nflow of fresh or clean air, did not provide adequate medical isolation facilities, and did not \nprotect inmates from the spread of life-threatening infections. \n22.  There have been roof leaks that were never fixed. \n23.  The leaks were patched on the inside, not the outside, and buckets caught the \nwater. \n\nCase 5:09-cv-00320-TMG   Document 1   Filed 01/22/09   Page 9 of 22\n24.  The leaking water ran down into the walls, ruined the sheetrock and left holes in \nthe walls. Inmates were not given enough food resulting in substantial weight loss in many \ninmates. \n25.  Food from previous meals was left on trays. \n26.  Food was not handled properly and sometimes smelled. \n27.  Food that should have been served hot was often served cold. \n28.  Food often was stored in refrigerators that were not cold enough to safely store \nand preserve food for human consumption. \n29.  The drinking water was a dirty brown color. \n30.  The kitchen was infested with cockroaches and fruit flies. \n31.  On at least one occasion, the prison was locked down for a time due to sewage \ncoming up through a grease trap in the kitchen. \n32.  A sewage pipe in the cafeteria ceiling leaked raw sewage into the cafeteria. \n33.  Cafeteria ceiling tiles were replaced regularly, but the sewage pipe was never \nfixed. \n34.  Due to the sewage leak, the cafeteria smelled like urine. \n35.  Showers which the inmates use were rarely cleaned, and whenlifthey were \ncleaned, they were never cleaned properly. \n36.  Showers were moldy, dirty and had hair on the floors. \n37.  C-Tier and K-Tier showers were merely rinsed with a hose to wash the hair down \nthe drain. \n38.  Some showers had pipes coming out of the walls, missing tiles and feces on the \nwalls. \n\nCase 5:09-cv-00320-TMG   Document 1   Filed 01/22/09   Page 10 of 22\n39.  The shower water was dirty. \n40.  Many showers had no hot water, did not work properly and had too many inmates \nusing them at one time (i.e. seven [7] to thirteen [13] inmates used a six [6] man shower all at the \nsame time). \n41.  The inmates were not required to shower, therefore, some did not creating further \nrisk of the development and/or spread of infection(s). \n42.  Inmates could usually take only one shower per day. \n43.  After recreational activities, inmates had to remain sweaty and dirty until, and if, \nthe guards allowed them to shower. \n44.  Even if permitted to shower, inmates often did not have enough soap to shower \nproperly. \n45.  Once, after a flood had occurred in the prison, inmates were unable to shower for \nabout a week. \n46.  Inmates were not always allowed to shower on time, and showers were often \nlimited in time to about five (5) minutes per inmate. \n47.  Many inmates were refused showers for various reasons, such as when corrections \nofficers would wrongly claim that an inmate had already showered, when there were alleged \nemergencies in other areas of the prison, and sometimes for no reason at all. \n48.  When inmates pressed the issue of wanting to shower, they faced being written up \nand taken to lock down (the \"Hole\") by the guards or commanding officer. \n49.  Many inmates were afraid to use the toilets because of the unsanitary conditions. \n50.  Many toilets leaked. \n51.  Due to overcrowding, thirty (30) inmates at a time, sleeping on the floor in plastic \n\nCase 5:09-cv-00320-TMG   Document 1   Filed 01/22/09   Page 11 of 22\n\"boats\", were housed in the \"Gym\" with access to only one (1) toilet and two (2) showers, and \neight (8) inmates were in one (1) cell with one (1) toilet and one (1) small sink. \n52.  It was common practice to have overcrowded cells with inmates sleeping on dirty \nfloors on mattresses, in plastic \"boats\" or simply on the floor. \n53.  Inmates were made to sleep on the floor for extended periods of time. \n54.  Many inmates slept on the floor next to toilets with feces rings. \n55.  The general population and medical cells were dirty and had severe mold and \nmildew issues. \n56.  The cells were rarely cleaned and had holes, open concrete, paint peeling, cables \nand bare wires hanging and/or sticking out, and spit and other unhealthy things on the surfaces. \n57.  Basically, the cells were filthy and coming apart. \n58.  Inmates requesting to clean their cells were usually denied or ignored altogether. \n59.  When given time to clean their cells, inmates used a mop and dirty water that had \nbeen passed from cell to cell and left a foul odor. \n60.  Any supplies given to the inmates for cleaning were limited, heavily diluted with \nwater and ran out. \n61.  Cells were not disinfected between inmates. \n62.  In general population, linens and towels were usually taken weekly to be washed \nbut were washed together with the laundry of inmates who were suffering from MRSA. \n63.  Changing linens, towels and washing laundry were not mandatory. \n64.  The inmates blankets were virtually never washed. \n65.  Laundry was taken to be washed weekly, but it came back wet and with the same \nstains as before it was washed. \n\nCase 5:09-cv-00320-TMG   Document 1   Filed 01/22/09   Page 12 of 22\n66.  Mattresses that had been defecated and urinated on were not cleaned or changed \nbetween inmates, and instead, were quite often left in place for the next inmate's use. \n67.  Several inmates were working in the kitchen when they contracted MRS A. \n68.  Even after the prison experienced MRSA outbreaks, many inmates remained \nworking in the kitchen with clear MRS A symptoms. \n69.  Inmates found to have, or suspected of having, MRSA were usually placed in a \n\"MRS A cell,\" which was any cell with other inmates who had or were suspected of having \nMRS A. \n70.  Many different cells, both in general population and medical, were used as MRS A \ncells. \n71.  MRS A cells were often in general population and very near, if not next to, cells \nwith inmates that did not have and were not suspected of having MRS A. \n72.  Inmates awaiting culture results for MRSA were typically placed in MRS A cells \nand started on antibiotics, but they were often housed with MRSA positive inmates until their \nresults came back. \n73.  When in a MRS A cell, the inmates' linens and laundry were quite often not \nwashed at all, and they would only change their jumpsuits. \n74.  MRS A cells were especially filthy and effectively locked down with no visits, no \nrecreation, no phone calls and being let out only to shower occasionally. \n75.  If an inmate's culture results were negative for MRSA, antibiotic treatment was \noften ended, and the inmate was returned to general population after being housed with MRS A \ninfected inmates. \n76.  Staff at the prison would often tease or taunt infected inmates, calling them \n\nCase 5:09-cv-00320-TMG   Document 1   Filed 01/22/09   Page 13 of 22\n\"MRSA-naries\", among other names, and acting as though they were less than human. \n77.  At times, inmates in MRSA cells were only able to shower every other day. \n78.  Sometimes inmates in MRS A cells had to use general population showers. \n79.  Each of the individually named defendants were aware of and responsible for the \nconditions described above, and have allowed these conditions to continue. \nAllegations Specific to Mr. Fernandez \n80.  Based upon records provided by defendants on or about April 4, 2007 Mr. \nFernandez notified medical staff that a finger of his right hand was swollen and painful. \n81.  Based upon records produced by defendants, a doctor or medical staff member \nwrote a physician order on April 9, 2007 directing that Mr. Fernandez be placed in isolation until \nfurther notice and to house him alone. \n82.  However, despite the physician'S written order, Mr. Fernandez was placed in cell \non H-Tier, the \"flats\", with a MRS A positive inmate, where he remained for approximately four \n(4) days, exposed to an inmate suffering from MRS A. \n83.  Mr. Fernandez was given antibiotics while he was in the cell with the MRS A \npositive inmate .. \n84.  The area on Mr. Fernandez' finger was cultured and reported as positive for \n\"heavy growth of staphylococcus aureus.\" \n85.  The cell that Mr. Fernandez occupied with the MRS A positive inmate was filthy \nas were the bed linens and towels that he was given to use there. \n86.  Based upon records provided by Defendants, on or about July 4, 2008 , and \ncontrary to the medical notes provided, Mr. Fernandez developed a painful, swollen bump on the \nleft side of his jaw which he reported to the medical unit staff. \n\nCase 5:09-cv-00320-TMG   Document 1   Filed 01/22/09   Page 14 of 22\n87.  At the time that this bump developed Mr. Fernandez was in BHU-4, known \namong the prison population as \"The Hole,\" as it is the area where inmates are placed if they \nhave been found to have committed an infraction of prison rules. \n88.  Mr. Fernandez asked the medical staff to leave him in the \"Hole\"rather than return \nto the dirty, unsanitary conditions that he had experienced in the H-Tier Isolation cell in April \n2007. \n89.  The medical staff put Mr. Fernandez on antibiotics, cultured the wound on his \njawline and left him in \"The Hole.\" \n90.  On July 10,2008 a laboratory report on the culture came back reading positive for \nMRS A. \n91.  Based upon records provided by Defendants, Mr. Fernandez reported the \ndiscovery of a boil under his left armpit to medical staff on or about September 18, 2008. \n92.  Based upon records provided by Defendants, while they suspected that Mr. \nFernandez had a recurrence of MRS A the medical staff prescribed Bactrim, did not culture the \nboil and did not isolate Mr. Fernandez. \n93.  During November 2008 the prison was locked down for 6 consecutive days, \nduring which Mr. Fernandez, along with the other inmates he was housed with in the B Unit, \nwere not permitted to shower or change their bed sheets at all. \n94.  Based on information and belief, Mr. Fernandez developed a boil on his right \ncheck, popped the boil, and he reported to medical staff on or about December 5, 2008. \n96.  Based on information and belief, Mr. Fernandez showed the popped boil to the \nmedical staff on or about December 5,2008 at which time a nurse told him he had MRSA, did \nnot culture the area, did not provide proper wound care, prescribed antibiotics for him and \n\nCase 5:09-cv-00320-TMG   Document 1   Filed 01/22/09   Page 15 of 22\nisolated him in cell H-13 alone. \n97.  Mr. Fernandez remained in H-13 for approximately 3 days. \n99.  When he was discharged from isolation and returned to B-2, Mr. Fernandez still \ndid not receive proper wound care, the affected area oozed and discharged blood and pus on to \nhis pillow when he slept, and the pillow case was not changed until he asked several times for a \nclean one. \n100.  Mr. Fernandez has grave fears about reoccurrences and infecting his loved ones \nwith the diseases he contracted while at Northampton County Prison. \n101.  As a result of Defendants' conduct, Plaintiff suffered the embarrassment, \nimmense pain, bumps and scarring associated with contracting multiple cases of MRS A. \n102.  Plaintiff was subjected to the unsanitary conditions ofthe prison and its medical \nunit, including but not limited to defendants' failures to provide sufficient antibacterial soap for \nplaintiffs personal use, preventing him from properly cleaning himself to prevent contracting \ndiseases such as MRSA. \n103.  The prison medical staff, including defendants, knew and/or reasonably should \nhave known that Plaintiff was at risk of contracting a staph infection, but they were deliberately \nindifferent to this risk, failing to protect Plaintiff by housing him with a MRS A positive inmate, \nMr. Rios and/or allowing Plaintiff to determine the location of proper isolation - i.e., \"The Hole\" \n- rather than assure that he was isolated and treated in a properly sanitized cell that would \nprovide for a safe environment both for Plaintiff to heal and to prevent him from developing \nfuture MRS A outbreaks. \n104.  The PrimeCare Defendants have engaged in a pattern and practice of failing \nand/or refusing to generate, maintain, and/or preserve accurate medical records. \n\nCase 5:09-cv-00320-TMG   Document 1   Filed 01/22/09   Page 16 of 22\n105.  Defendants have engaged in a pattern and practice of failing and/or refusing to \nprovide adequate and necessary medical treatment to inmates. \n106.  Defendants have engaged in a pattern and practice of failing to adequately treat \ninmates who require medical care. \n107.  Defendants have acted with deliberate indifference toward Plaintiff s medical \nneeds and well-being, in that they knew of the substantial risk of serious harm to Plaintiff and \nthey ignored that risk. \n108.  Defendants' actions and inactions have amounted to unnecessary and wanton \ninfliction of pain and grief. \n109.  Defendants' actions and inactions toward Plaintiff have caused him physical and \nemotional injury, and have created significant and permanent scarring. \n110.  Defendants have violated Plaintiff s clearly established and well-settled federal \nand state constitutional rights, including his right to be free from deliberate indifference to his \nmedical needs and well-being. \n111.  Defendants acted with callous indifference toward Plaintiff s federal and state \nrights. \n112.  At all times during the events described above each of the Defendants, upon \ninformation and belief, were aware of and acquiesced in the acts of the other Defendants. \n113.  Upon information and belief, each Defendant advised, assisted, directed, and/or \nratified the actions that are at issue herein. \n114.  Upon information and belief, each of the individual Defendants played a \nsubstantial role and provided input which affected the adverse actions against Plaintiff. \n115.  Defendants County, PrimeCare, Sprague, Gessner, Haskins, and Buskirk have, \n\nCase 5:09-cv-00320-TMG   Document 1   Filed 01/22/09   Page 17 of 22\nwith deliberate indifference, failed to adequately train, supervise and discipline personnel at the \nprison, and the injuries to Plaintiff were caused by, and were a foreseeable consequence of, such \nfailures. \n116.  Defendants County, PrimeCare, Sprague, Gessner, Haskins, and Buskirk have, \nwith deliberate indifference, failed to provide sanitary and humane conditions in the prison and \nits medical unit, and the injuries to Plaintiff were caused by, and were a foreseeable consequence \nof, such failures. \n117.  Defendants County, PrimeCare, Sprague, Gessner,  Haskins, and Buskirk have, \nwith deliberate indifference, failed to adequately train and supervise personnel at the prison \nconcerning the proper sanitation practices to provide for the health and humane treatment of the \ninmates', and the injuries to Plaintiff were caused by, and were a foreseeable consequence of, \nsuch failures. \n118.  At all times relevant to the allegations herein, Defendants have refused and/or \notherwise failed to provide the recommended treatment to individuals with MRSA, including but \nnot limited to, not providing MRS A patients with all doses of antibiotics on the required \nschedule, and not providing medical attention to the MRS A patients to the extent that some \npatients' MRS A \"boils\" or infections have been opened in and under unsanitary conditions by \nother individuals. \n119.  Defendants Sprague, Haskins, Gessner and Buskirk knew and/or reasonably \nshould have known that they, the County and PrimeCare had provided inadequate training, \nsupervision and discipline to personnel at the prison, and that this failure of training, supervision \nand discipline was likely to result in the constitutional violations that caused Plaintiffs injuries. \n120.  Plaintiffs serious injuries were a foreseeable and direct result of Defendants' \n\nCase 5:09-cv-00320-TMG   Document 1   Filed 01/22/09   Page 18 of 22\nactions and inactions. \n121.  At all times relevant to the allegations herein, Defendants have refused and/or \notherwise failed to follow the protocol recommended by the Department of Health and Human \nServices, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for the prevention and/or treatment of \nMRSA, and have routinely and continually exposed individuals with MRSA to those who do not \nhave it, allowed filthy and unsanitary conditions to exist. \n122.  At all times relevant to the allegations herein, Defendants have refused and/or \notherwise failed to provide clean, sanitary conditions at Northampton County Prison and thus, \nhave created an environment in which MRS A not only exists, but has thrived to the point of \nbecoming epidemic in proportions. \n123.  Defendants' conduct shocks the conscience. \n124.  As a direct and proximate result of the Defendants' wrongful actions and \ninactions, Plaintiff has incurred significant hardship. \n125.  As a direct and proximate result of the Defendants' wrongful actions and \ninactions, Plaintiff has suffered grievously and needlessly, including, without limitation, severe \nbodily injury, extreme pain and discomfort, and severe emotional distress. \nCOUNT I - 42 U.S.C. § 1983 - VIOLATION OF EIGHTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS \n126.  The allegations of all the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint are realleged \nherein as if fully set forth. \n127.  Defendants, acting under color of law, denied Plaintiff his rights under the \nEighth Amendment to the United States Constitution in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, \nas amended, 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n128.  As a direct and proximate result of the aforesaid, Plaintiff has been damaged as \n\nCase 5:09-cv-00320-TMG   Document 1   Filed 01/22/09   Page 19 of 22\nalleged. \nCOUNT II -42 U.S.c. § 1983 -VIOLA nON OF FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS \n129.  The allegations of all the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint are realleged \nherein as i2  fully set forth. \n130.  Defendants, acting under color of law, denied Plaintiff his rights under the \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in violation of the Civil Rights Act of \n1866, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n131.  As a direct and proximate result of the aforesaid, Plaintiff has been damaged as \nalleged. \nCOUNT III - 42 U.S.c. § 1983 - DEFENDANT NORTHAMPTON COUNTY \n132.  The allegations of all the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint are realleged \nherein as if fully set forth. \n133.  Prior to the events described herein, Northampton County developed and \nmaintained policies, practices and/or customs exhibiting deliberate indifference to the \nconstitutional rights of persons within the Northampton County Prison, which caused violations \nof Plaintiff's rights. \n134.  It was the policy, practice and/or custom of Northampton County to provide \nunsafe, inhumane and unsanitary conditions in the prison and its medical unit. \n135.  It was the policy, practice and/or custom of Northampton County and PrimeCare \nto fail to adequately treat and/or to dump inmates who required extensive and/or expensive \nmedical care. \n136.  It was the policy, practice and/or custom of Northampton County to inadequately \nand improperly investigate and scrutinize the backgrounds of administrators and medical service \n\nCase 5:09-cv-00320-TMG   Document 1   Filed 01/22/09   Page 20 of 22\nproviders, including those identified herein. \n137.  As a result, Northampton County retained administrators and medical service \nproviders, including those identified herein, who have deprived the federally and state protected \nrights of people with whom they have come into contact, including Plaintiff. \n138.  This deprivation of rights was the plainly obvious consequence of the County's \nfailure to adequately and properly investigate and scrutinize the backgrounds of administrators \nand medical providers. \n139.  It was the policy, practice and/or custom of Northampton County to inadequately \nand improperly investigate complaints regarding constitutional violations at the Prison (including \ncomplaints concerning inadequate medical care and inhumane prison conditions), and such \nviolations were instead tolerated by the County. \n140.  It was the policy, practice and/or custom of Northampton County to inadequately \nsupervise and train its administrators and medical providers, including those identified herein, \nthereby failing to adequately discourage further constitutional violations on the part of these \nofficials. \n141.  Northampton County did not provide and/or require appropriate in-service \ntraining or re-training to prevent constitutional violations. \n142.  As a result of the above-described policies, practices and customs, administrators \nand medical providers of the Northampton County Prison, including those identified herein, \nbelieved that their actions would not be investigated or sanctioned, but would be tolerated. \n143.  The above described policies, practices and customs demonstrated a deliberate \nindifference on the part of the policymakers of Northampton County to the constitutional rights \nof persons within the Prison, and were the cause of the violations of Plaintiff's rights as alleged \n\nCase 5:09-cv-00320-TMG   Document 1   Filed 01/22/09   Page 21 of 22\nherein. \n144.  As a direct and proximate result of the aforesaid, Plaintiff has been damaged as \nalleged. \nCOUNT IV -CONSTITUTION OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA -\nVIOLATION OF ARTICLE I, SECTION 13 \n145.  The allegations of all the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint are realleged \nherein as if fully set forth. \n146.

Admitted. \n \n \n\nCase 5:09-cv-00320-TMG   Document 23   Filed 05/13/09   Page 2 of 16\n  3-6.  The averments of paragraphs 3-6 are directed to parties other than the Answering \nDefendants; accordingly no response is required. \n  7.  Admitted. \n  8.

However, the \nprison has acted reasonably to promptly diagnose and treat inmates exhibiting symptoms of \nMRSA infection and to prevent spread of the infection to other inmates. \n  13.  Denied as stated.  The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) has \nstated the following concerning MRSA:  “MRSA infections that occur in otherwise healthy \npeople who have not been recently (within the past year) hospitalized or had a medical procedure \n(such as dialysis, surgery, catheters) are known as community-associated (CA)-MRSA \ninfections.  These infections are usually skin infections, such as abscesses, boils, and other pus-\nfilled lesions.”  The CDC has further stated that “[i]n the outbreaks of MRSA, the environment \nhas not played a significant role in the transmission of MRSA.  MRSA is transmitted most \nfrequently by direct skin-to-skin contact.  You can protect yourself from infections by practicing \ngood hygiene (e.g., keeping your hands clean by washing with soap and water or using an \nalcohol-based hand rub and showering after working out); covering any open skin area such as \nabrasions or cuts with a clean dry bandage; avoiding sharing personal items such as towels or \nrazors; using a barrier (e.g., clothing or a towel) between your skin and shared equipment; and \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:09-cv-00320-TMG   Document 23   Filed 05/13/09   Page 3 of 16\nwiping surfaces of equipment before and after use.” \n  14.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  It is admitted only that MRSA infection can \npresent as a pimple or boil on the skin.  By way of further response, individuals may be \ncolonized in the nose or on the skin with MRSA for years and not develop an active skin \ninfection.  According to the CDC, “[a]pproximately 25% to 30% of the population is colonized \n(when bacteria are present, but not causing an infection) in the nose with staph bacteria.” \n  15.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  It is admitted only that the drainage of skin boils \nor abscesses may require medical attention.   \n  16.  Admitted in part, denied in part.  It is admitted only that MRSA infection can \ncause scarring in some cases; however, whether and to what extent scarring occurs varies from \nindividual to individual and infection to infection. \n  17.  Admitted. \n  18.  Admitted.  By way of further response, the first factor identified by the CDC as \nbeing associated with MRSA infection is “close skin-to-skin contact.”  In addition, according to \nthe CDC the first thing an individual should do to prevent MRSA infection is to practice good \npersonal hygiene by keeping his or her hands clean and washing them thoroughly. \n  19-21. Denied.  By way of further response, inmates are responsible for cleaning their \ncells every day and can be sanctioned for failing to pass daily cell inspections.  \n  22-23. Denied. \n24.
