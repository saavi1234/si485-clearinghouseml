Plaintiffs alleged that as a result of Hurricane Rita they were subject to inhumane and unsanitary conditions of confinement. Plaintiffs also alleged that the conditions under which they were employed at a UNICOR factory manufacturing Kevlar helmets for a Department of Defense contract were similarly inhumane. Plaintiffs alleged that as a result of a delay in production caused by Hurricane Rita they were forced to work grueling days in unsanitary conditions, while also being subject to confinement at the Beaumont Federal Correctional Institution which was heavily damaged by Hurricane Rita and not fit to house prisoners. </p><p>In February 2009, the U.S. moved to dismiss the case, and in the alternative for summary judgment. Briefing was voluminous, but appears to have ended in October 2009.  As of March 2012, the judge had not decided the motion -- and issued a notice stating his intention to decide it soon.  This did not happen, however.  While the motion was pending, in October 2012, the plaintiffs' lawyer died.  No other lawyer appeared to take his place.  A year later, in December 2013, Magistrate Judge Giblin recommended that the case be dismissed for failure to prosecute.  District Court Judge Marcia Crone adopted that recommendation, and dismissed the case without prejudice should one or more of the plaintiffs decide to refile.  It does not appear that any plaintiff objected.  </p>",

INTRODUCTION AND LEGAL STANDARDS\nA. Background.\nThis case concerns an action filed by forty-seven federal inmates under the Federal Tort\nClaims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C § 2674.  Plaintiffs generally complain about conditions at the\nFederal Correctional Complex in Beaumont, Texas, resulting from the aftermath from Hurricane\n\nCase 1:08-cv-00593-MAC-KFG   Document 10    Filed 02/17/09   Page 2 of 21 PageID #:  81\nRita in 2005.  Plaintiffs allege the United States is liable because the Federal Bureau of Prisons\n(BOP) breached its duty of care under 18 U.S.C. 4042(a)(2) by failing to provide suitable\nquarters, safekeeping, care and subsistence at the Federal Correctional Complex - Medium\nSecurity Institution in Beaumont, Texas (FCC Beaumont Medium). See  generally Compl.  Plaintiffs\nclaim the United States is liable under Texas law for: (1) negligence; (2) coercion (Walsh-Healey\nAct  violations);  (3)  reckless  disregard  for  another’s  welfare  or  deliberate  indifference;  (4)\nmalice; and (5) cruel and unusual punishment as a constitutional tort. Id. at 6.\nPlaintiffs have filed administrative claims as required by 28 U.S.C. § 2675.  According to\nPlaintiffs’ suit, the time frame of material events to this suit and the actionable span of time for\ntheir claims is from November 8, 2005 through the end of February 2006. Id. ¶¶ 10 & 49.  Each\nclaimant  seeks  $250,000.000  in  damages.    Id.  at  37.    Plaintiffs  also  request  an  award  for\nattorney’s fees.  Id.\nB. Summary Judgment Standard.\nAs a procedural vehicle for disposing of deficient claims, summary judgment is not a\n“disfavored procedural shortcut”; rather, it is an important procedure “designed to secure the\njust, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action.”  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S.\n317, 325 (1986)(quoting FED.R.CIV.P. 1).  Summary Judgment is appropriate if the moving\nparty demonstrates that there is “no genuine issue as to any material fact” and that it is “entitled\nto a judgment as a matter of law.”  FED.R.CIV.P. 56(c).  While the party seeking summary\njudgment carries the burden of demonstrating that there is no actual dispute as to any material\nfact in the case, this burden does not require the movant to produce evidence showing the\nabsence of a genuine issue of material fact.  Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 325.  The moving party\n-2-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-00593-MAC-KFG   Document 10    Filed 02/17/09   Page 3 of 21 PageID #:  82\nsatisfies its burden by “pointing out to the district court . . . that there is an absence of evidence to\nsupport the nonmoving party’s case.”  Id.\nOnce the moving party satisfies its burden, the nonmovant must “set forth specific facts\nshowing that there is a genuine issue for trial.”  FED.R.CIV.P. 56(e).  The nonmovant must also\narticulate the precise manner in which the evidence he sets forth supports his claims.  See Forsyth\nv. Barr, 19 F.3d 1527, 1537 (5th Cir. 1994)(citation omitted).  Moreover, in designating specific\nfacts, the nonmovant must “‘go beyond the  pleadings’” and use “‘his own affidavits, . . .\ndeposition[s], answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file.”’ Jones v. Sheehan & Young\nCulp, P.C., 82 F.3d 1334, 1338 (5th Cir. 1996)(citation omitted).  If the nonmovant fails to set\nforth specific facts in support of allegations essential to that party’s claim and on which that\nparty will bear the burden of proof, then summary judgment is appropriate.  Celotex, 477 U.S. at\n323.  Even if the nonmovant brings forth evidence in support of its allegations, summary\njudgment will be appropriate unless there is sufficient evidence favoring the nonmoving party for\na jury to return a verdict for that party.  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249\n(1986)(citations omitted).  If the evidence is merely colorable, or is not significantly probative,\nsummary judgment may be granted.  See id. \nC. Applicable Standard for Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1).\nA motion to dismiss filed under Rule 12(b)(1) challenges the federal district court’s\nsubject matter jurisdiction.  FED.R.CIV.P. 12(b)(1).  “A case is properly dismissed for lack of\nsubject  matter  jurisdiction  when  the  court  lacks  the  statutory  or  constitutional  power  to\nadjudicate the case.” Home Builders Ass’n of Miss., Inc. v. City of Madison, 143 F.3d 1006, 1010\n(5th Cir. 1998) (quoting Nowak v. Ironworkers Local 6 Pension Fund, 81 F.3d 1182 (2d. Cir. 1996)).\n-3-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-00593-MAC-KFG   Document 10    Filed 02/17/09   Page 4 of 21 PageID #:  83\nFederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction and lack the power to adjudicate claims absent\njurisdiction conferred by the Constitution or legislation.  Coury v. Prot, 85 F.3d 244, 248 (5th Cir.\n1996); see also Stockman v. Federal Election Comm’n, 138 F.3d 144, 151 (5th Cir. 1998).  Subject\nmatter jurisdiction cannot be waived or conferred by agreement of the parties.  Id.  “In ruling on a\nmotion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, a court may evaluate (1) the complaint\nalone, (2) the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts evidenced in the record, or (3) the\ncomplaint supplemented by undisputed facts plus the court’s resolution of disputed facts.” Den\nNorske Stats Oljeselskap As v. HeereMack V.O.F., 241 F.3d 420, 424 (5th Cir. 2001), cert.\ndenied, 534 U.S. 1127 (2002)(citing Barrera-Montenegro v. United States, 74 F.3d 657, 659 (5th\nCir. 1996)).\nFurthermore, the party seeking to invoke the court’s jurisdiction bears the burden of\nestablishing the basis for such jurisdiction.  Ramming v. United States, 281 F.3d 158, 161 (5th\nCir. 1991); see also Harvey Constr. Co. v. Robertson-Ceco Corp., 10 F.3d 300, 303 (5th Cir. 1994).\nThus, when a challenge is made to the exercise of jurisdiction, the burden falls on the plaintiff\nto demonstrate that such jurisdiction is proper.  Stuart v. Spademan, 772 F.2d 1185, 1192 (5th\nCir. 1985).  Upon a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the district court is\nentitled to consider disputed facts as well as undisputed facts in the record.  Ramming, 281 F.3d at\n161.  In resolving the question of subject matter jurisdiction, the district court can refer to\nevidence outside the pleadings.  Luckett v. Bure, 290 F.3d 493, 496-97(2d Cir.2002); see also\nRosemound Sand & Gravel Co., v. Lambert Sand & Gravel Co., 469 F.2d 416, 417-18 (5th\nCir.1972); O’Rourke v. U.S., 298 F.Supp.2d 531, 534.  Unlike with a motion for failure to state\na claim under FED.R.CIV.P. 12(b)(6), the attachment of exhibits to an FED.R.CIV.P. 12(b)(1)\n-4-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-00593-MAC-KFG   Document 10    Filed 02/17/09   Page 5 of 21 PageID #:  84\nmotion does not convert it to an FRCP motion for summary judgment.  Gonzales, v. U.S., 284\nF.3d 281, 288 (1st Cir.2002).  As set forth below, the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction on\ncertain of Plaintiffs’ claims.\nD. Applicable Standard for Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\nMotions to dismiss for failure to state a claim are appropriate where the defendant attacks\nthe complaint because it fails to state a cognizable claim.  FED.R.CIV.P. 12(b)(6).  A complaint\nmay be dismissed for failure to state a claim where it “appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff\ncan prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.”  Conley v.\nGibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1957); Grisham v. United States, 103 F.3d 24, 25-26 (5th Cir 1997).\nSuch dismissal is also appropriate where a plaintiff’s allegations are conclusory or where the\ncomplaint shows relief is barred by an affirmative defense.  Kaiser Aluminum & Chem. Sales, Inc.\nv. Avondale Shipyards, 677 F.2d 1045, 1050 (5th Cir. 1982).  As set forth below, Plaintiffs’ fail\nto state a claim on certain of their claims.\nII. ARGUMENT AND ANALYSIS\nThe United States is immune from suit unless it has waived its immunity and consented to\nsuit. Price v. United States, 69 F.3d 46, 49 (5th Cir. 1995).  The FTCA constitutes the federal\ngovernment’s waiver of its immunity to a variety of suits and sets forth the specific conditions of\nthat waiver. McNeil v. United States, 897 F.Supp. 309, 311-312 (E.D. Tex. 1995)(Cobb, J.).  As a\nwaiver of sovereign immunity, the FTCA must be construed narrowly. Id.  Any ambiguity in\nconstruction must be resolved in favor of the government. Leleux v. United States. 178 F.3d 750,\n754 (5th Cir. 1999).  The FTCA permits suits “under circumstances where the United States, if\na private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the\n-5-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-00593-MAC-KFG   Document 10    Filed 02/17/09   Page 6 of 21 PageID #:  85\nact or omission occurred.” 28 U.S.C. § 1346(b).  The FTCA applies to negligent torts as well as\nto certain specifically enumerated intentional torts.  See 28 U.S.C. § 2680(h).\nClaim 1 - Negligence.\nPlaintiffs claim the United States was negligent and breached its duty of care under 18\nU.S.C. § 4042(a)(2) by failing to provide suitable quarters, safekeeping, care and subsistence.\nCompl. ¶ 84.  Plaintiffs also claim the Government violated American Correctional Association\nstandards  3-4317  and  3-4134.    Specifically,  Plaintiffs  claim  Unit  K/A  and  the  medical\ndepartment at FCC Beaumont Medium was not suitable as they were allegedly infested with\nmold.  Id. ¶ 85.  Plaintiffs further allege the United States violated the duty of care and safekeeping\nby compelling Plaintiffs to “drink contaminated water with brown matter floating” in it. Id.\n“Under Texas law, the elements of a negligence claim are (1) a legal duty on the part of the\ndefendant; (2) breach of that duty; and (3) damages proximately resulting from that breach.” Sport\nSupply Group, Inc. v. Columbia Cas. Co., 335 F.3d 453, 466 (5th Cir.2003)(citing Van Horn v.\nChambers, 970 S.W.2d 542, 544 (Tex.1998);and Praesel v. Johnson, 967 S.W.2d 391, 394\n(Tex.1998)).\nThe United States does not dispute that it has a duty of care under 18 U.S.C. § 4042 to\nprovide suitable quarters or to provide for the safekeeping, care and subsistence of inmates in its\ncustody.  The United States does contest, however, that it breached that duty or that Plaintiffs\nsuffered any damages as a result of their assignment to Unit K/A and work in the UNICOR\nfactory at FCC Beaumont Medium.\n-6-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-00593-MAC-KFG   Document 10    Filed 02/17/09   Page 7 of 21 PageID #:  86\nA. Mold Claims.\nUnit K/A at FCC Beaumont Medium was suitable to house Plaintiffs in November 2005.\nPrior to Plaintiffs’ assignment to Unit K/A, it was cleaned. See Exh. 1 ¶ 3, Declaration of Jessica\nCline, Counselor at FCC Beaumont Medium.  The cleaning was done by FCC Beaumont Camp\ninmates  and  supervised  by  FCC  Beaumont  Medium  staff.  Id.    Cleaning  the  unit  included\nremoving wax from the floors, scrubbing the walls, wiping the mattresses, and scrubbing and\ndisinfecting the toilets, sinks and showers.  Id.  Supplies to clean the unit included  QD-64, which\nis a germicidal cleaner, disinfectant, and deodorizer effective against HIV, staphylocidal, fungus,\netc.; Ajax, with oxygenated bleach; and a mold and mildew remover. See Exh. 2 ¶ 3, Declaration\nof Rebecca Kays, Safety Specialist at FCC Beaumont Medium.  There was no mold in Unit K/A.\nExh. 1 ¶ 7; Exh. 2 ¶ 4.  Further, Counselor Cline never received any verbal or written complaints\nabout mold from any Plaintiff. Exh 1 ¶ 7.  In fact, Counselor Cline’s office is in Unit K/A and\nneither  the  current  inmates  assigned  to  the  Unit  nor  other  Unit  staff  have  complained  or\ncommented about mold in Unit K/A. Id.  If anyone would have been concerned about mold in\nUnit K/A it would have been the staff that worked there everyday like Counselor Cline.  The fact\nthat neither staff nor inmates expressed concern about mold is strong evidence that Unit K/A\nwas not infested with black mold.\nLikewise, Plaintiffs allegations that the medical department at FCC Beaumont Medium\nwas infested with mold is not true.  Health Systems Specialist David Miller is assigned to medical\nat FCC Beaumont Medium. Exh. 4 ¶ 5.  When Plaintiffs returned to FCC Beaumont Medium\nthe medical department was fully functional and operational. Id.  Mr. Miller had an office in the\nmedical department and never heard any complaints from inmates or staff that the department\n-7-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-00593-MAC-KFG   Document 10    Filed 02/17/09   Page 8 of 21 PageID #:  87\nwas infested with mold. Id.  In fact, if medical staff had suspected mold, because of their\nspecialized knowledge, they would have immediately informed the warden that the area was a\nhealth hazard. Id.  That did not happen because the medical department was not infested with\nblack mold.\nThere was, however, some mold at the FCC Beaumont after Hurricane Rita in 2005. Exh.\n2 at ¶ 4. This mold, however, was restricted to the records room at the Central Administration\nBuilding and the outside Warehouse. Id.  These buildings are not within the secure perimeter of\nFCC Beaumont Medium where Plaintiffs were assigned. Id.  The mold was remediated by a\ncontract firm. Id.  There was no mold in Unit K/A nor the medical department at FCC Beaumont\nMedium. Id.\nIt is undisputed that current staff and inmates assigned to Unit K/A and staff assigned to the\nmedical department have not complained about black mold.  It is undisputed that there has never\nbeen any mold remediation of Unit K/A or the medical department at FCC Beaumont Medium.\nIf Plaintiffs’ claims are true, Unit K/A and the medical department would be condemned buildings\nas it has been over three years since both places, without remediation, were allegedly infested with\nblack mold.  The medical department and Unit K/A are still used today at FCC Beaumont Medium.\nInmates currently live in Unit K/A and staff such as Counselor Cline still work and have an office\nthere.  Further, the medical Department is still treating inmates at FCC Beaumont Medium and\nHealth  Systems  Specialist  Miller  still  has  an  office  there.    The  United  States  did  provide\nsuitable quarters for Plaintiffs and did not breach its duty under 18 U.S.C. § 4042.\n-8-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-00593-MAC-KFG   Document 10    Filed 02/17/09   Page 9 of 21 PageID #:  88\nB. Contaminated Water Claims.\nNext, Plaintiffs cannot prove the United States breached its duty to provide care and\nsafekeeping by compelling them to drink contaminated water.  According to Exhibit 3, declaration\nof  Steven  McBride,  Utilities  System  Repairer  Operator  Foreman  at  FCC  Beaumont,  water\nreceived by FCC Beaumont from the City of Beaumont must be sampled and independently\ntested by the State of Texas. Exh. 3 ¶ 2.  These samples are tested for Coliform and Escherichia\nColi.  Id.  Water samples were taken and tested on the following dates: August 24, 2005,\nSeptember 21, 2005, October 20, 2005, November 21, 2005, December 28, 2005, January 25,\n2006, February 16, 2006, and March 30, 2006. Id.  Not a single one of these test results\ndemonstrate that the water at FCC Beaumont contained Coliform and Escherichia Coli. Id. ¶ 3.\nThe results demonstrate the water at FCC Beaumont was within state requirements and safe to\ndrink.  \nAssuming arguendo that the United States did breach its duty to provide suitable quarters\nand provide care and safekeeping, Plaintiffs cannot produce one shred of independent, non-\nsecondary-gain, non-malingering medical evidence that they suffered any harm or damages that\nwere proximately caused by the breach of the duty to provide suitable quarters and provide care\nand safekeeping.\nAccordingly, because there was no mold present in Unit K/A nor the medical department\nat FCC Beaumont Medium, the United states did not breach its duty to provide suitable quarters to\nPlaintiffs.  Further, because independent water quality analysis demonstrates that the water at\nFCC Beaumont was safe to drink, the United States did not breach its duty to provide for the care\nand safekeeping of Plaintiffs.  Finally, because Plaintiffs cannot produce any independent medical\n-9-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-00593-MAC-KFG   Document 10    Filed 02/17/09   Page 10 of 21 PageID #:  89\nevidence of injury or damages from the alleged breach of duty, Plaintiffs’ negligence claim\nfails.  The United States is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ negligence claim that it\nfailed to provide suitable quarters, care and safekeeping.\nClaim 2 - Walsh- Healey Act Violations.\nA. Plaintiffs’ Walsh-Healey claims.\nPlaintiffs allege that they are entitled to better wages, hours, and benefits, based upon the\nWalsh-Healey Act, 41 U.S.C. § 35, et seq.  Because the provisions of the Walsh-Healey Act clearly\ndo not apply, however, Claim 2 of the Complaint must be dismissed.\n1. Inmates are not FPI employees.\nFederal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI or trade name UNICOR) is a statutorily-created,\nwholly-owned government corporation of the District of Columbia, created by Act of Congress\nin 1934.  It is charged with “determining in what manner and to what extent industrial operations\nshall be carried on in Federal penal and correctional institutions.”  18 U.S.C. § 4121; see 28 C.F.R.\n§  345.11  (2001).    FPI’s  mission  is  to  provide  “work  simulation  programs  and  training\nopportunities for inmates confined in Federal correctional facilities.”  28 C.F.R. § 345.11.  In order\nto achieve this goal, FPI operates factories in over 100 Federal prisons across the country.  It\nmanufactures products and services in eight different business groups: Electronics, Clothing &\nTextiles, Fleet Management & Vehicular Components, Services, Office Furniture, Recycling,\nIndustrial Products, and Graphics.\nTypically, each prison (with the exception of minimum security and administrative/pretrial\nfacilities) in the Federal system contains one UNICOR factory which is a division of one of the\n-10-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-00593-MAC-KFG   Document 10    Filed 02/17/09   Page 11 of 21 PageID #:  90\nabove referenced business groups.  USP Lompoc, for example, has a factory which is affiliated\nwith the electronics business group.1 \nThe issue of whether an inmate is an employee of FPI may have been a novel question in\n1934, when FPI was created by President Roosevelt.  However, any such question has long\nsince  been  resolved,  in  numerous  contexts,  most  importantly  the  FLSA,  which  is  closely\nanalogous to the Walsh-Healey Act.  In that context, the Fifth Circuit held:\nWe have held that prisoners not sentenced to hard labor, who worked\noutside the jail for a private firm, were FLSA employees of the\nprivate firm. Watson v. Graves, 909 F.2d 1549, 1556 (5th Cir.1990).\nIn a similar situation, we held that a jailer was not the FLSA\nemployer of an inmate working in a work-release program for a\nprivate employer outside the jail. Reimonenq v. Foti, 72 F.3d 472,\n475-76 (5th Cir.1996). We have also held that inmates who work\ninside a prison for a private enterprise are not FLSA employees of the\nprivate company. Alexander v. Sara, Inc., 721 F.2d 149, 150 (5th\nCir.1983). However, until today we have not expressly stated whether\nthere is any FLSA employment relationship between the prison and\nits inmates working in and for the prison.\n...\nWe join these other circuits and hold that a prisoner doing work in or\nfor the prison is not an employee” under the FLSA and is thus not\nentitled to the federal minimum wage.\nLoving v. Johnson, 455 F.3d 562, 563 (5th Cir. 2006).  See also Coupar v. U.S. Department of\nLabor, 105 F.3d 1263 (9th Cir. 1997); Hale v. Arizona, 993 F.2d 1387 (9th Cir.); cert. denied 510\nU.S. 946 (1993).  As in those previous cases, the Plaintiffs in the present case do not have a\npecuniary relationship with FPI.  Their relationship with the government is purely penological\n1  Although participation in the FPI program is voluntary, all medically eligible sentence\ninmates in the Bureau of Prisons are required to have a prison work assignment Coupar v. United\nStates Department of Labor, 105 F.3d 1265 (9th Cir. 1997); 18 U.S.C. § 4121 note; 28 C.F.R.\n§ 545.20(a).\n-11-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-00593-MAC-KFG   Document 10    Filed 02/17/09   Page 12 of 21 PageID #:  91\nin nature and, therefore, they cannot be considered an employee of FPI.  Coupar, 105 F.3d at\n1264-65; Hale, 993 F.2d at 1392-94.2\nAlthough the present case involves the Walsh-Healey Act, not the FLSA, the relationship\nbetween the inmate-worker and FPI under both statutes is identical: penal not pecuniary.  As such,\nwhile these inmates can be said to be working at, assigned to, or in the service of FPI, they clearly\nare not employees. Id.  See also Nicastro v. Reno, 84 F. 3d 1446, 1446-47 (D.C. Cir. 1996);Walton\nv. United States, 551 F.3d 1367, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2009).  As such, it is clear that where, as in the\npresent case, inmates have been assigned to work for FPI, and all work was performed within\nthe prison walls, there is absolutely no basis upon which to find that inmate are employees of\nFPI or the United States.  As such, the provisions of the Walsh-Healey Act do not apply, and\nPlaintiffs’ second claim must be dismissed with prejudice.3\n2. This Court lacks jurisdiction over Walsh-Healey claims.\nEven assuming arguendo that inmates were somehow employees of FPI or the United\nStates, this court is without jurisdiction over the Walsh-Healey Act claims.  First, by its own terms,\nthe Walsh-Healey Act specifically exempts inmates assigned to FPI from its provisions.  In\nSection 8, which is codified at 41 U.S.C. § 42, the statute reads:\n2  To be sure, incarceration with no work assignment at all would be well within the\nbounds of the sentence imposed.  James v. Quinlan, 866 F.2d 627, 629-30 (3rd Cir.), cert. denied\n493 U.S. 870 (1989)(Prisoners have no Constitutionally protected liberty or property interest in\ntheir prison work assignments); Bulger v. BOP, 65 F.3d 48, 50 (5th cir 1995)(Prisoner has\nno legitimate claim of entitlement to continuing UNICOR employment).\n3  Plaintiffs’ reliance on the criminal statute for the transportation or importation of\nprison-made goods, 18 U.S.C. § 1761, as the basis for their claim of entitlement to the protections of\nthe Walsh-Healey Act is nonsensical and wholly without merit.\n-12-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-00593-MAC-KFG   Document 10    Filed 02/17/09   Page 13 of 21 PageID #:  92\nsections 35 to 45 of this title shall not be construed to modify or\namend Title III of the Act entitled “An Act making appropriations for\nthe Treasury and Post Office Departments for the fiscal year ending\nJune 30, 1934, and for other purposes”, approved May 3, 1933\n(commonly known as the Buy American Act) [41 U.S.C.A. § 10a et\nseq.], nor shall the provisions of sections 35 to 45 of this title be\nconstrued to modify or amend sections 3141 to 3144, 3146, 3147 of\nTitle 40, nor the labor provisions of Title II of the National Industrial\nRecovery Act, approved June 16, 1933, as extended, or of section 7\nof the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act, approved April 8, 1935;\nnor shall the provisions of sections 35 to 45 of this title be construed\nto modify or amend chapter 307 and section 4162 of Title 18.\nOf course, Chapter 307 of Title 18 includes FPI’s statute, which is found at 18 U.S.C.\n§ 4121-4129.  So, it is clear on its face that the Walsh-Healey Act is not intended to apply to\ninmates assigned to FPI (or any other inmate work assignment within the institution.)\nFurthermore, Section 1 of the Walsh-Healey Act makes it clear that the Act applies to,\n“persons employed by contractors of the United States.”  41 U.S.C. § 35.  FPI, however, is not a\ncontractor of the United States.  It is a government corporation, created by Congress in 1934, and\nis a component of the Federal Bureau of Prisons.  Sales by FPI to other government agencies,\nincluding DoD, are considered intragovernmental transfers, not contracts.  18 U.S.C. § 4124( c);\nNicastro v. Clinton, 882 F. Supp. 1128, 1129 n. 2 (D. D.C.), aff’d  84 F.3d 1446 (D.C. Cir. 1996).\nThere is no basis upon which to apply the Walsh-Healey Act to intragovernmental transfers.  Id.\nFinally, as a procedural matter, the Walsh-Healey Act does not create an independent\nright of action in the Federal District Court against the United States.  Instead, it specifically lays\nout an administrative procedure in which such claims must be adjudicated before the Secretary\nof Labor.  41 U.S.C. §§ 37-38.  Plaintiffs provide no evidence to indicate that they participated in\nthis procedure in any way, or otherwise involved the Secretary of Labor, as required by the\n-13-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-00593-MAC-KFG   Document 10    Filed 02/17/09   Page 14 of 21 PageID #:  93\nstatute.  As such, this Court is without jurisdiction to hear this claim pursuant to the explicit\nprovisions of the Walsh-Healey Act.\nBased upon the above discussion, it is abundantly clear that there is absolutely no basis\nupon which the Walsh-Healey Act (or, for that matter the FLSA) could be applied to Federal\ninmates assigned to FPI.  As such, Claim 2 of the Complaint is without merit and should be\ndismissed in its entirety with prejudice.\nB. Plaintiffs’ on-the-job claims of injury.\nIt is well settled that the exclusive remedy for any injury suffered by an inmate during\nthe course of his work assignment is the Inmate Accident Compensation system, 18 U.S.C.\n§ 4126(c)(4).  United States v. Demko, 385 U.S. 149, 151-52, 87 S.Ct. 382, 384 (1966); Aston v.\nUnited States, 625 F.2d 1210, 1211 (5th Cir. 1980)(citing Demko); Joyce v. United States, 474\nF.2d 215, 219 (3rd Cir. 1973)(discussing the same issue with respect to the analogous FECA\nstatute); Vaccaro v. Dobre, 81 F.3d 854, 857 (9th Cir. 1996)(Demko establishes that 18 U.S.C.\n§ 4126 is the exclusive remedy against the government); Granade v. United States, 356 F.2d 837,\n840-41 (2d Cir.), cert. denied 385 U.S. 1012, 87 S.Ct. 720 (1967).  Thus, the FTCA’s waiver of\nsovereign immunity does not and cannot extend to actions relating to an injury suffered by an\ninmate during the course of performing his institution work assignment.  Demko, 385 U.S. at 151-\n52, 87 S.Ct. at 384.\nTherefore, if Plaintiffs’ allegations indicate that his injury was incurred while working,\nthen this Court must dismiss the Complaint for lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction.  Demko, 385\nU.S. at 153, 87 S.Ct. at 385;  Aston, 625 F.2d at 1211 (where an inmate was injured “on the job,”\nthe district court lacks jurisdiction to hear a cause of action grounded on the Federal Tort\n-14-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-00593-MAC-KFG   Document 10    Filed 02/17/09   Page 15 of 21 PageID #:  94\nClaims Act);  Premachandra v. United States, 739 F.2d 392, 394 (8th Cir. 1984)(a precisely\ndrawn, detailed statute pre-empts more general remedies);Wooten v. United States, 825 F.2d\n1039, 1044 (6th Cir. 1987)(whether Plaintiff’s injuries were caused by the performance of work\nis irrelevant; as long as the injury occurred while the inmate was on the job, section 4126 is the\nexclusive remedy.)\nIn the  present  complaint, Plaintiffs make several allegations regarding the UNICOR\nfactory, primarily relating to hazardous materials which were allegedly released into the air while\nmanufacturing Kevlar helmets.  Compl. ¶¶ 50-59.  Because these allegations relate specifically to\nthe conditions within the UNICOR factory, they are precluded by the Prison Industries Fund, 18\nU.S.C. § 4126(c)(4).  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ claim of injury as a result of hazardous chemical\nvapors must be dismissed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), as the Court lacks\nsubject matter jurisdiction over this claim.\nClaim 3 - Reckless Disregard for Welfare / Deliberate Indifference.\nPlaintiffs allege the United States acted recklessly and with deliberate indifference by\ncompelling them to work from 7:30 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. in a building that contained hazardous\nvapors; failing to provide safety apparel; housing them in a condemned building; making them\ndrink contaminated water and take cold showers; and allowing them less than an hour for their\npersonal needs. Compl ¶ 96.\n“There is no precise statutory or case law definition for ‘reckless disregard for the safety\nof others.’” City of San Antonio v. Schneider, 787 S.W.2d 459, 465 (Tex.App.- San Antonio 1990).\n“It appears that the breach of such duty lies between ‘ordinary’ and ‘gross’ negligence.” Id.\n“[R]eckless disregard includes essential characteristic of gross negligence, and indicates an entire\n-15-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-00593-MAC-KFG   Document 10    Filed 02/17/09   Page 16 of 21 PageID #:  95\nwant of care sufficient to raise the belief or presumption that the act or omission complained of\nwas the result to conscious indifference to the rights, welfare, or safety of the person or persons\naffected  by  it.”  Id.    “[R]eckless  disregard  means  more  than  momentary  thoughtlessness,\ninadvertence  or  error  of  judgment.”    Thus,  “reckless  disregard  and  gross  negligence  are\nsynonymous terms.” Id.; see also Western Guaranty Loan Co. v. Dean, 309 S.W.2d 857, 860 (Tex.\nCiv.App. 1957).\nIn Texas “gross negligence involves two components: (1) viewed objectively from the\nactor’s standpoint, the act or omission complained of must involve an extreme degree or risk,\nconsidering the probability and magnitude of the potential harm to others; and (2) the actor must\nhave actual, subjective awareness of the risk involved, but nevertheless proceed in conscious\nindifference to the rights, safety, or welfare of others.” Lee Lewis Construction, Inc. v. Harrison, 70\nS.W.3d 778, 785 (Tex. 2001)(citing Transportation Insurance C. v. Moriel, 879 S.W.2d 10, 23\n(Tex. 1994)).  “The first element, ‘extreme risk,’ means not a remote possibility of injury or even\na high probability of minor harm, but rather the likelihood of serious injury to the plaintiff.” Id.\n(citations omitted).  “The second element, ‘actual awareness,’ means that the defendant knew\nabout the peril, but its acts or omissions demonstrated that it did not care.” Id. (citations omitted).\nHere, Plaintiffs cannot prove gross negligence.  Certainly, there is no extreme degree or\nrisk of harm from working 7:30am to 9:00pm, taking a cold shower, or allowing less than an\nhour of time for their personal needs.  As to the allegations of being forced to work in a building\nthat  contained  hazardous  vapors,  not  being  provided  safety  apparel,  being  housed  in  a\ncondemned building and drinking contaminated water, it is impossible for Plaintiffs to prove the\n-16-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-00593-MAC-KFG   Document 10    Filed 02/17/09   Page 17 of 21 PageID #:  96\nsecond element of gross negligence.  Plaintiffs must prove that there was actual awareness of\nthe peril, but the United States took no action because it did not care.\nPlaintiffs will find it insurmountable to prove “actual awareness” that housing Unit K/A\nwas condemned.  According to Counselor Cline and Safety Specialist Kays, there was no black\nmold in Unit K/A. Exh. 1 ¶ 7, Exh. 2 ¶ 4.  The Unit was operational and inspected and cleaned\nbefore inmates were returned to the Unit in November 2005. Exh. 1 ¶ 6.  Because these staff\nmembers indicate no mold was present in Unit K/A, actual awareness is impossible for Plaintiffs\nto prove.\nPlaintiffs will find it impossible to prove that the United States was actually aware that\nthe water at FCC Beaumont Medium was contaminated.  As set forth supra, according Steven\nMcBride, Utilities System Repairer Operator Foreman at FCC Beaumont, water received at FCC\nBeaumont is sampled and independently tested by the State of Texas. Exh. 3 ¶ 3.  These samples\nare  tested  for  Coliform  and  Escherichia  Coli.  Id.    Water  samples  taken  and  tested  from\nNovember 2005 through March 2006 indicate the water at FCC Beaumont was within state\nrequirements and safe to drink. Id.\nIn addition, as demonstrated supra, the claims of working hazards in UNICOR are\nprecluded by United States v. Demko, 385 U.S. 149, 151-52, 87 S.Ct. 382, 384 (1966).  The United\nStates did not waive sovereign immunity for those claims.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ claims of\nbeing forced to work in a building that contained hazardous vapors and not being provided\nsafety apparel should be dismissed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1).\nFinally, as discussed infra in Defendant’s response to Claim 4, Plaintiffs’ deliberate\nindifference  claims  are  constitutional  claims  which  are  not  cognizable  under  the  FTCA.\n-17-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-00593-MAC-KFG   Document 10    Filed 02/17/09   Page 18 of 21 PageID #:  97\nAccordingly, Defendant should be granted summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ gross negligence\nclaim, and their deliberate indifference claim should be dismissed under Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 12(b)(1).\nClaim 4 - Cruel and Unusual Punishment (as a Constitutional Tort).\nPlaintiffs claim the United States violated the Eighth Amendment by “denying [them]\nthe minimal civilized measures of life’s necessities.”4 Compl. ¶¶ 99-104.  They claim they were\nforced to drink contaminated water and were exposed to toxic fumes that were spawned by the\npresence of black mold in Unit K/A. Id.  They further claim that the Eighth Amendment was\nviolated because there was an absence of hygiene and sanitation in Unit K/A and that there was\na lack of medical care. Id.\nThe FTCA waives sovereign immunity “under circumstances where the United States, if\na private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the\nact or omission occurred.” 28 U.S.C. § 1346(b); see also 28 U.S.C. § 2674.  Accordingly, there is\nno waiver of sovereign immunity to suits predicated on tort causes of action cognizable under\nstate law and the waiver is inapplicable to constitutional torts. Brown v. United States, 653 F.2d 196,\n201-02 (5th Cir. 1981); see also  Keene Corp v. United States, 700 F.2d 836, 845 n. 13 (2d Cir.\n1983)(no waiver of sovereign immunity for constitutional torts.); Allen v. Travis, 2008 WL\n1849171, *4 (N.D. Tex. 2008)(Constitutional torts are excepted from the FTCA.); Reed v. Hadden,\n473  F.Supp.  658,  660  n.2  (D.  Colo.  1979)(A  private  individual  could  not  violate  another\n4  Plaintiffs have not identified a cause of action in tort recognized by Texas that can be\nasserted alleging the same constitutional theory of recovery.\n-18-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-00593-MAC-KFG   Document 10    Filed 02/17/09   Page 19 of 21 PageID #:  98\nindividual’s constitutional rights, thus, the United States could not be liable under the FTCA for\nviolation of constitutional rights.).\nPlaintiffs’ claim of constitutional tort violations against the United States fails and must\nbe dismissed.  The United States has not waived sovereign immunity to be sued for the individual\nactions of FCC Beaumont Medium staff for violations of the Constitution.  To be successful,\nPlaintiffs’ constitutional tort claims must be brought against federal officials in their individual\ncapacities under Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S.\n388 (1971).  Here, only the United States is a defendant.\nPlaintiffs’ claim is barred by sovereign immunity. “The United States must consent to be\nsued, and that consent is a prerequisite to federal jurisdiction.” Delta Commercial Fisheries Ass'n\nv. Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council, 364 F.3d 269, 273 (5th Cir. 2004)(citing United\nStates v. Navajo Nation, 537 U.S. 488, 502, 123 S.Ct. 1079, 155 L.Ed.2d 60 (2003)).  Accordingly,\nPlaintiffs’  claim  of  an  Eighth  Amendment  violation  against  the  United  States  should  be\ndismissed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1).\nClaim 5 - Malice.\nPlaintiffs claim the prison employees acted with malice by failing to give them access to\nthe law. Compl. ¶¶ 105-108.  Defendant presumes this claim refers to Plaintiffs’ access to courts\nallegations as mentioned in paragraphs 79-82 of the complaint.  There, Plaintiffs complain that\nstaff threatened and retaliated against them for filing tort claims.\nWhile Plaintiffs’ allege malice, the gravamen of the allegations is one of retaliation.  A\nretaliation claim in this context is essentially an access to courts claim under the First Amendment.\nMorris v. Powell, 449 F.3d 682, 686 (5th Cir. 2006).  As discussed supra, a constitutional claim\n-19-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-00593-MAC-KFG   Document 10    Filed 02/17/09   Page 20 of 21 PageID #:  99\nagainst the United States should be dismissed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1)\nfor failure to state a claim.\nIf Plaintiffs truly intend to assert a claim for malice under Texas law, that claim wholly\nlacks merit.  In Texas, malice means:\n(A) a specific intent by the defendant to cause substantial injury to the claimant; or \n(B) and act or omission: (i) which when viewed objectively from the standpoint of\nthe actor at the time of its occurrence involves an extreme degree of risk, considering\nthe probability and magnitude of the potential harm to others; and (ii) of which the\nactor has actual, subjective awareness of the risk involved, but nevertheless proceeds\nwith the conscious indifference to the rights, safety, or welfare of others.\nV.T.C.A., Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 41.001.  Malice in Texas is an element of and related to an\nexemplary (punitive) damages claim.  Hartford Cas. Ins. v. Powell, 19 F.Supp.2d 678, 696\n(N.D.Tex.1998); see also V.T.C.A., Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 41.003.   Defendant can find no\nTexas case law where a private person was sued for malice as a cause of action in tort, nor do\nPlaintiffs cite to any cases.  Further, under the FTCA, the United States is not liable for punitive\ndamages. 28 U.S.C. § 2674.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ malice claim should be dismissed under\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nPlaintiffs suit should be dismissed.  Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on the\nnegligence  claim  as  it  did  not  breach  its  duty  of  care.    Further,  even  if  Defendant  was\nnegligent, Plaintiffs can prove no damages proximately caused by that negligence.  Further,\nPlaintiffs’ Walsh-Healey Act claims fail because the United States did not waive sovereign\nimmunity for that type of claim.  Plaintiffs’ reckless disregard / deliberate indifference / cruel and\n-20-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-00593-MAC-KFG   Document 10    Filed 02/17/09   Page 21 of 21 PageID #:  100\nunusual punishment (as a Constitutional tort) claims fail for the same reason.  Finally, Plaintiffs\nmalice claim fails because Texas does not recognize a cause of action in tort for malice.\nWHEREFORE,  PREMISES  CONSIDERED,  Defendant  prays  that  its  Motion  to\nDismiss be granted under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), and in the\nalternative that its motion for summary judgment be granted and that the above-styled and\nnumbered case be dismissed in its entirety with Plaintiff taking nothing by this suit.\nRespectfully submitted,\nREBECCA  A.

Jurisdi ction  is conferred  upon  this  court by 28 U.S.C. § 1331 \nwhich authorizes federal courts to decide cases concerning federal questions. \n  4\n\n2. Venue is proper in this Court because the true party in interest is an \nagency of the United States, to  wit the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. § 1391 (e) (2), a civil ac tion may be brought in any judicial \ndistrict in which a substantial part of the event or omissions giving rise to the \nclaim occurred. All of these events a nd omissions took place at the Federal \nCorrectional  Complex  at Beaumont,  Texas  on Knauth Road, Beaumont,  \nTexas 77705, thus satisfying the venue criteria for 28 U.S.C. § 1391 (e)(2).  \nApplicable Federal Statutes \n3.  Plaintiffs bring t his  action against the United States under the \nFederal Tort Claims Act, in accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 1346 (b)(2). \n4.  At all times material to the  events  referenced hereafter, the \nindividual employees and agents of  the Federal Government were acting \nwithin the scope of their employment as defined in 28 U.S.C. § 2671. \n           5.  All  plaintiffs  were  inmates living at the Beau mont  Federal \nCorrectional  Institution Medium .  All pl aintiffs  have presented a prior \nshowing  of physical injury in  accordance  with 28 U.S.C. § 1346(b), \ncompounded by both mental and em otional injuries which are inextricably \nintertwined with these physical inj uries. All plaintiffs point to a common \nsource for these physical and mental injuries, namely coerced labor requiring \n12 hour days, running seven days a week, coupled with close and prolonged \n  5\n\nproximity and repeated over exposure to hazardous products at a UNICOR \nfactory, further exacerbated by living  in a condemned building with only \ncontaminated and unsafe water to dri nk. The physical deprivations suffered \nand the resulting injuries are of such a  nature that these physical and mental \ninjuries will be lingering and will persist for a long period of time  \n6.  If the United States were a priv ate  party, it would be liable to \nPlaintiffs for acts and om issions of its employees and agents under the law \nof the place wher e said acts and omissi ons occurred, to wit in the State o f \nTexas under common law tort claim s for: (1) negligence, (2) coercion; (3) \nreckless disregard for another’s welfare or deliberate indifference, (4) malice \nand (5) cruel and unusual punishment as a constitutional tort. \nThe Parties \n7. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2675(a),  administrative remedies must be \nexhausted before seeking relief in a U.S.  District Court. If an administrative \nclaim is denied, a lawsuit must be commenced in six months. \n8.  There are 47 cl aimants  that ha ve  exhausted their adm inistrative \nremedies. Less than six months has elapsed since these claims were denied. \nAccordingly, this Court has jurisdiction to decide these claims.  \n9. All claimants are wards of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, housed at \nthe Beaumont Federal Correctional In stitution Medium. Claimants are also \n  6\n\nemployees of a prison indust ry called UNICOR, which is a self-sustaining \ncorporation established to create a real world work environment for inmates. \n10. Claimants were present when Hurricane Rita landed on September \n25, 2008. In the next 4 to 10 days, claimants were evacuated to other federal \nth th\nprisons. On or about November 7 , and again on Novem ber 18 , 2005, the \nfirst claimants were first brought back  to Beaumont Medium against their \nwills. The remaining claimants returned in late November and December of \n2005. This occurred 5 and 6 m onths before the Beaumont Medium prison \nwas repaired to the point t hat it could pass an inspection conducted by the \nFederal Bureau of Prison’s Regional Office in Dallas – Fort Worth and once \nagain serve as a prison. All material events set fort h in this Complaint took \nplace between November of 2005 and extended to February of 2006, before \nthe Medium prison in Beaumont could pass an inspection.    \n11. Defendant is the Unites States Government, under whose auspices \nboth  the Beau mont  Federal Correcti onal  Institution Medium   prison in \nBeaumont and the UNICOR factory associated with this prison, operate.   \nAllegations Common to all Claims \n  12.  The Beau mont  Federal Correc tional  Institution  Medium  is \noperated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons and, like every other federal adult \nprison, it is accredited by  the American Correctional Association and it has \n  7\n\nembraced standards in Program Statements set by the American Correctional \nAssociation. Bureau of Prison Director  Harley Lappin sits on t he American \nCorrectional  Association’s Standard s  Committee,  which establishes \nstandards for the accreditation of correctional institutions nationally. \n          13.  Beaumont Federal Correctional Institution Medium at Beaumont \nis  subject to the American Correcti onal  Association standards and it i s \nregularly audited to insure that it maintains these standards. \n  14. The Beaumont Federal Correctional Institution Medium operates a \nUNICOR factory which manufactures the PASGT Kevlar [hereafter Kevlar] \nmilitary helmet for the U.S. Department of Defense [a/k/a military].     \n15. American Correctional Association Standard 3-4401 states: \n \n           “Written policy, procedure and practice provide that all \ninstitutional work, industry and vocational education progra ms \nmust  meet  minimum  applicable  federal,  state or local wor k, \nhealth  and safety standards.  There  is documentation that th e \nprograms  are inspected by federa l  state or local health and \nsafety  officials at least a nnually.  The program s  are also \ninspected weekly by qualified de partmental staff and m onthly \nby a safety officer.” \n  \n  16. The written policy of the Federal Bureau of Prisons im plementing \nthe above Standard is attached as Exhibit 1 and, in relevant part, states: \n  “3. Operating machinery without use of safety guard(s) \nas provided is forbidden and subject to disciplinary action. \n \n            5.  To  protect  against  physical injury and / or health \nhazard,  each in mate  worker  is required to use all saf ety \n  8\n\nequipment  provided.  Personal  protective  equipment such as  \nhard hats, hearing protection,  goggles, respirators, aprons, arm \nguards, wire mesh gloves and safe ty shoes are to be used i n \ndesignated  areas and  must  be  worn in the proper mann er. \n[Emphasis in original text.] \n \n            6. Safety goggles must be worn when perform ing any \ngrinding,  chiseling, filing or   sanding operation.   Landscape \noperations involving the operation of weed eaters or edgers also \nrequire the use of safety goggles. \n \n            11.  Safety  hazards  are to be reported to your work \nsupervisor immediately. If the  work supervisor does not agree \nthat an unsafe condition exists, you are to report t he unsafe \ncondition  to the institution’s  Safety  Manager  for further \nconsideration.” \n \n17. American Correctional Association Standard 3-4404 states: \n \n  “Written policy, procedure, and practice provide that the \nnumber of inmates assigned to industries operations m eet the \nrealistic workload needs of each industries operating unit.” \n \n  18. On September 25, 2005, the Federal Prison Complex at Beaumont \nwas struck by the eye of Hurricane R ita. As the hurricane approached, the \nfirst building struck was the Medium prison. This means it was the first to be \nrocked by airborne debris carried from locations beyond the prison complex.   \n19. At the eye of the hu rricane, where winds are the most intense, the \nMedium prison was struck by sustai ned winds averaging 125 miles an hour \nor more. At this speed, the force of  these winds equals 1,250 pounds per \nsquare inch or roughly the weight of  32 concrete building blocks slamming \nagainst each square inch of wall and glass window encountered.  \n  9\n\n  20. Prison staff was not prepared for this hurricane and its devastating \neffects. The prison lost its electricity and there was no back-up source of \npower. Immediately, the prison could  no longer run its ventilation and air \nconditioning system. Plumbing became nonfunctional. Plastic bags had to be \nissued for the urine and feces of prisoners. Water became contaminated. \n  21. Outside, the temperatures hovered above 90 degrees. Inside these  \ncells, the temperature was between  100 and 110 degrees. As one claimant \ndescribed, the heat was unbearable, th ere was no sanitary drinki ng water, \nsevere hydration, overpowering stench from body waste with no possibility \nof showering or getting a clean set of sheets or even fresh clothing. \n  22.  To avoid suffering from   dehydration,  every occupant of t he \nMedium prison had to drink large quantities of contaminated drinking water. \nThis continued until they were finally evacuated, in some cases for a week.            \n23.  Once inmates were evacu ated,  the  edifice lef t  standing was a \ncondemned building in every sense of t he term. The Medium prison was \nunsuitable for human habitation and fo r use as a functioni ng prison. The \nperimeter fence was either  gone or on t he ground, large parts of t he roof \nwere blown away, electricity and plumbing were non-existent, water damage \nwas extensive throughout the interior and, along with this water damage, the \nhurricane left interior walls extensively infested with Black Mold.   \n  10\n\n  24.  Claimants were evacuated to  Federal prisons at Leavenworth,  \nKansas, Bennettsville and Williamsburg, South Carolina and other prisons. \n  25. For the last week of Septem ber, all of October and the first week \nof November, 2005, not a single Kevl ar helmet was m anufactured at the \nUNICOR factory in the Beaumont Federal Correctional Institution Medium. \n26. UNICOR is the sole source supplier to the Department of Defense \nfor the Kevlar military helmet.  The  order for Kevlar helmet s is placed by \nthe  Defense  Supply Center Philadelphia ,  an entity operating under the \nDepartment  of Defense’s  Defense  Logistics Agency .  In its website, the \nDefense  Supply Center Philadelphi a  prides itself on  transitions  from \nmanaging items to managing the supply chain.   \n27. The order from the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia is placed \nwith UNICOR’s Central Office at 320 Fi rst Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. \n20534, which is also the Central Offi ce address for the Federal Bureau of \nPrisons.  Within UNICOR, the ad ministration  of this order for Kevlar \nhelmets is placed with the Electronics Mfg. and Plastics Program.  \n28.  Upon inform ation  and belief, in   the course of m onitoring  the \nsupply chain for Kevlar helmets, the  Defense Supply Center Philadelphia  \nbecame aware of a shortage sometime in October or early November. Given \nthe events which unfolded in November and December of 2005, a flash point \n  11\n\nwas  obviously reach ed  and enorm ous  pressure  was soon applied by the \nDefense  Supply Center Philadelphia   to UNICOR’ s  Electronics  Mfg. and \nPlastics Program in Washington, D.C. This is the only plausible explanation \nfor an extraordinary sequence of events which unraveled thereafter in Texas. \nTransfer Back to Beaumont Medium and Daily Work Schedule \n  29.   Claimants were first orde red  back to Beaum ont  Federal \nCorrectional Institution Medium on November 8, 2005. After just survi ving \na hurricane, followed by 4 to 10 days of  being forced to drink contaminated \nwater  and living i n  the stench of th eir  own body waste, none of t hese \nclaimants wanted to return. In every cas e, claimants were told that they had \nno choice. They were compelled to return. They arrived by bus and by plane. \n  30. Claimants were taken to cells  in the least damaged K/A Unit, still \nleft filthy from its earlier departed o ccupants who, like them selves, had to \nendure a hurricane’s ravages until evacuated. Claimants arrived late at night, \nsometimes after 11 p.m. They were given no cleaning supplies and their own \nsupplies were still in transit. They were told that they would be woken up at \n6 a.m. the next day and left to sleep  on a filthy mat containing the dri ed up \nsweat and dirt of an  unknown earlier occupant. Hygiene and sanitation was \nnonexistent. K/A Unit sustaine d roof leaks, exposed wires, water damage \nand extensive mold. It was the least damaged but far from being undamaged.  \n  12\n\n  31. American Correctional Association Standard 3-4317 states: \n \n“Written policy, procedure, and practice provide for the issue of \nsuitable  clothing  to  all in mates.  Clothing is properly fitted,  \nclimactically suitable, durable, and presentable.” \n \n32. Clothing was issued to claimants at random from the Laundry. In \nmost cases, the clothing either did not  fit or, if it c ould be worn, the fitting \nwas such that it made a person’s appearance look comical.   \n33. When claimants awoke at 6 a.m.  and left K/A Unit, they noticed \nsigns informing guards that the water was not safe to be drunk. Despite this \nwarning, claimants had to drink, wash , cook and bath in this contam inated \nwater. They only received one small bottle of sanitary water each day. \n  34. From the Medium prison, they went to the Chow Hall, where they \nwere  bluntly  told by Warden Mors e,  Superintendent  of Industries \nHollingsworth and others, that they were brought back to complete a million \ndollar UNICOR contract and nothi ng else. They would not  get recreation \ntime, no law library time, no time to do anything but work at UNICOR.  \n35. Claimants were further told that if they did not want to work, they \nwould go to the Special Housing Unit (i.e. the hole). The hole consisted of a \n23 hour lockdown, and carried the po ssibility of losing earned good time,  \nwhich was equivalent to post poning their projected releases and keeping \nthem in prison longer. Under coercion and duress, claimants agreed to work.  \n  13\n\n  36. The Chow Hall floor was cove red with water which dripped from \ngaping holes in the ceiling. After eati ng breakfast, claimants were taken to \nthe UNICOR factory by 7:30 a.m.. \n          37. Claimants returning on November 8, 2005 re-opened the UNICOR \nfactory. After a lunch break, their 8 hour  shift ended at 3:30 p.m. Claimants \nwere compelled to work overtime.  \n38. In the first weeks of November, they worked 14 hour days, 7 days \na week. In late November and the first half of December, the shifts went 12  \nhours, for 10 or 12 straight days before  getting a day off. For the m ost part \nthrough November and December, 2005, claimants worked from 7:30 a.m. \nuntil  9 p. m.  at night. Around Christ mas,  production  was finally brought \ncurrent and they were given a few days off for the holidays.  \n          39.  While  they  worked,  claimants were constantly ridi culed, \ntormented and yelled at because of dead lines on million dollar contracts.  If \nthey faltered, they were told in no un certain terms that they would be taken \nto the hole.  Duress and coercion were unrelenting and ubiquitous. \n40. Claimants were forced to work at an accelerated pace. They were \npushed to make as many helmets as  possible. The production from these \nhundred or so workers in two months was equal to the output of a work force \nmore than double their size working normal eight hour shifts.     \n  14\n\n41. In return, Claimants were paid $1.00 an hour for regular ti me and \n$2.00 an hour for overtime.  \n42. Asking for medical attention or reporting to sick call was not an \noption. The medical area of the pr ison was badly dama ged by water and \ntotally infested with black mold on its walls, running from the doctor offices \nto the examining rooms. The medical care part of the prison was shut down.  \n43. At the end of t he work day, they would come back to their cells  \nwith sore and aching feet, blisters on  their hands and exposed parts of their \nskin, feeling totally exhausted and in many cases, traumatized by the ordeal.   \n  44. American Correctional Association Standard 3-4400 states:       \n \n  “Written policy, procedure, and practice provide that the \ninmate workday approximates the workday in the community.” \n \n   The normal workday does not appr oximate getting woken at 6 a.m. \nand ordered to work until 9 p.m. seven days a week, with an hour or less of \npersonal time. This standard has been deliberately and recklessly violated.  \n          45. American Correctional Association Standard 3-4134 states: \n \n            “Inmates  have  access  to operable showers with \ntemperature-controlled  hot an d  cold runni ng  water at a \nminimum ratio of one shower fo r every eight inmates. Wat er \nfor  showers is therm ostatically  controlled to tem peratures \nranging from 100 Fahrenheit to 12 0 Fahrenheit to ensure the \nsafety of inmates and to promote hygienic practices.” \n \n  15\n\n           In support, the American Correctional Association’s comment reads, \n“…Water temperatures below 100 Fahr enheit are uncomfortable and may \ndeter an individual from pursuing good hygienic practices. …”   \n  46. There was no hot water in the showers of the K/A Unit and the \nwater coming out felt ice cold. After  working a 12 hour shi ft and being on \ntheir legs all day, this shower was  just added punishment. The cold water \nalso did nothing to promote hygiene and sanitation.  \n         47. In addition to cold temperatures, water from the showerhead had a \nbrown color to it and the shower ceili ng had leaks in the roof. You woul d \nfeel water coming from the ceiling and roof as well as the showerhead.  \n         48. Lights were off at 10 p.m. Claimants were given an hour or less to \ntake a shower and tend to any personal matters before they went to bed.  \n         49. The Beaumont Federal Correctional Institution Medium did not re-\nopen and begin to repopulate until April  of 2006. It was not until March of \n2006 that sufficient repairs could be ma de to pass an inspection. The m ost \nsevere state of disrepair occurred in November and December of 2005, and it \ngradually improved thereafter. The actionable span of time set forth in these \ntort claims is from November 8, 2005 to the end of February, 2006. During \nthis  time period, this  prison  was closed because it could not pass an \ninspection. Moving claimants before it reopened in April violated every rule.  \n  16\n\nUNICOR Factory Operations and Materials  \n  50. The UNICOR factory manufacturing these Kevlar helmets has 12 \npress machines that run at temperatures of about 175 degrees. In the int erior \nspaces, there is no vapor control and there is no ventilation. Heat build-up in \nsummer, due to the temperatures given off by the presses, often exceeds 100 \ndegrees because the hot air has no where to escape.  \n  51. To make a Kelvar military helmet, the following products are used \nin the production process: \n(1) DuPont Kevlar Fibers;   \n(2) Sherwin-Williams Kem Aqua Hydralon B, high gloss waterborne  \n      topcoat (Chemical Warfare Resistant Coating);  \n(3) Sherwin-Williams MIL-DTL-64159 Type I Chemical Resistant    \n     Coating;  \n(4) 3M Fastbond Contact Adhesive 30-NF Green;  \n(5) 3M Acryl-Green Spot Putty 05960;  \n(6) Solarez Polyester Laminating Resin;  \n  \n  52. American Correctional Association Standard 3-4318 states: \n \n“Written policy, procedure, and practice provide for the issue of \nspecial and, when appropriate, protective clothing and equipment \nto  inmates assigned to   the institution's f ood  service, hospital,  \nfarm, garage, physical plant maintenance shops, and other special \nwork details.”  [Emphasis added.] \n \n           In support, the American Correctional Association’s comment reads, \n“Inmates assigned to special work areas should be clothed in accordance with \nthe requirements of their work assignment and, when appropriate, be furnished \n  17\n\nwith  suitable protective  equipment  (disposable f ace  masks and gloves, \nprotective helmets, goggles, etc.).” \n  53. Every one of the above mentioned products used for manufacturing \nthese helmets either contained hazardous ingredients or, in processing, it could \nrelease hazardous vapors, mists and harmful solid matter, necessitating safety \napparel. Claimants were not issued protective clot hing calculated to protect  \nthem from harmful vapors, mists and inhalation of microscopic solid matter.  \n  54. Processing and handling of Kevl ar fibers can produce airborne  \nrespirable fibrils. The product’s material safety data sheet recommends using \nventilation or a respirator to minim ize fibril inhalation. Over exposure and \nlong term exposure to high doses of respirable fibers can lead to pulm onary \ninflammation and subsequent development of chronic  lung disease. If there \nis inadequate ventilation, the product’s safety data sheet recommends use of \nan air purifying respirator wit h a dust  / mist / fume cartridge or canister. \nClaimants  were subjected to overexpo sure  and to repeated long te rm \nexposure of Kevlar respirable fibrils in an unventilated area and without the \nrecommended  safety apparel. Accord ingly,  claimants have all inhaled \nrespirable fibrils, and they are all at risk for contracting chronic lung disease. \n          55. The material safety data sheet for Sherwin William s’ Kem Aqua \nHydralon B, high gloss waterborne topc oat states, “Use only with adequate \n  18\n\nventilation. Avoid breathing vapor or spra y mist. Do not get in eyes or on \nskin.” Two ingredients are hazardous. If ventilation is inadequate, the safety \ndata  sheet recomm ends  a properly  fitted  organic  vapor / partic ulate \nrespirator and safety glasses with unperforated side shields. Claimants were \nsubjected to overexposure and long term repeated exposure of this product’s \nvapor and mist and this occurred without the recommended safety apparel.  \n  56. The product safety data sh eet for Sherwin-Williams MIL-DTL-\n64159 Type I Chemical Resistant coati ng warns against inhalation of vapor \nor  spray m ist.  If this enters the  upper  respiratory system, it can cause \nheadache, nausea or dizziness. It furt her warns, “Use only with adequate \nventilation.” The safety apparel reco mmended for this product includes a \npositive pressure air supplied respirator, protective gloves and safety glasses \nwith  unperforated  sideshields.  Claimants  were subjected to overexposure \nand to long term repeated exposure to this product’s vapor and spray mist, in \nan unventilated area and without the recommended safety apparel. \n  57. The product safety data sheet  for 3M Fastbond Contact Adhesive \n30-NF Green warns against eye contact,  skin contact, inhalation, ingestion \nand  prolonged and repeated exposur e.  The safety apparel recommended \nincludes safety glasses with side shie lds, gloves or protecti ve clothing to \navoid skin contact, and a half or full f ace mask air purifying respirator with  \n  19\n\norganic vapor cartridges and N95 particul ate prefilters.  Without this safety  \napparel, prolonged and repeated overexposure can cause blurred or impaired \nvision, hearing impairment, balance dysfunction, ringing in ears, headache, \ndizziness, drowsiness, incoordination, slow reaction time, slurred speech and \ncomplete  loss of smell. Neu rological  damage  may consist of personality \nchanges, tingling and num bness in extremities, tremors, sensory loss and  \nchanges  in blood pressure and heart  rate.  Claimants were subjected to \noverexposure and to repeated long term exposure to the hazardous effects of \nthis product in an unventilated area without the recommended safety apparel.  \n          58. The product safety data sheet for 3M Acryl-Green Spot Putty No. \n05960 warns against eye contact and skin contact. It further states, “Use in a \nwell  ventilated area.” The safety  apparel  recommended  for  this product \nincludes safety glasses with side shie lds, gloves made from nitrile rubber,  \nand a half mask organic vapor respirator with dust/mist prefilter, or full face \norganic vapor respirator with dust /  mist prefilter or full face organic vapor \nrespirator with dust/mist prefilter. Without this safety apparel, prolonged and \nrepeated overexposure can cause kidney  effects (i.e. reduced urine volume, \nblood in urine), back pain, liver e ffects (i.e. yellow skin and tender upper \nabdomen), central neuropathy damage (i.e. dizziness, incoordination, visual \nchanges,  emotional  changes, trem ors  and convulsions). Claimants were \n  20\n\nsubjected to overexposure and repeated long term exposure to hazards of this \nproduct in an unventilated area, without the recommended safety apparel. \n  59. The product safety data sheet  for Solarez Polyester Lam inating \nResin warns against inhaling its vapor or mist. Recommended safety apparel \nincludes splash goggles, polyvinyl alco hol gloves and full face atm osphere \nsupplying  respirator or air purifying  respirator  for organic vapors if \nventilation  is not adequate. Without th is  safety appare l,  prolonged and \nrepeated overexposure can cause severe  eye irritation (i.e. redness, tearing \nand blurred vision), moderate skin irritation, nasal and respiratory irritation, \ndizziness, weakness, fatigue, nausea and headache. High concentration may \nresult  in narcosis (i.e. a condition  of  deep stupor or unconsciousness \nproduced by a chemical). Claimants we re subjected to overexposure and to \nrepeated  long  term  exposure to hazardous   effects of this product in an  \nunventilated area and without the recommended safety apparel. \nWalsh – Healey Act Compliance / Non-Compliance \n  60. Federal prisoners are considered employees under the Federal Fair \nLabor Standards Act by virtue of the fact that they are absent from the list of \n1\nexemptions set forth in this law (i.e. see 29 U.S.C. § 213 Exemptions).    \n                                                 \n1 See also Carter v. Dutchess Community College, 735 F. 2 nd 813 (2nd Cir. 1984); \nWoodall v. Partilla, 581 F. Supp. 1066 (N.D. Ill. 1984). \n  21\n\n  61. Federal prisoners engaged in the m anufacture of commodities for \nuse by the Federal Government under an approved inmate work program are \nspecifically exempted from paragraph (c ) of the Walsh-Healey Act, which \n2\notherwise  excludes convict labor from   its protections.   Accordingly, \nclaimants are entitled to the protections of the Wash-Healey Act.  \n  62. The contract between the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia and \nUNICOR’s  Electronics  Mfg. and Plasti cs  Program  exceeds $10,000. A \nMarch 2003 contract is worth $5,533,080. A ttached as an exhibit is a series \n3\nof contracts confirming that the Walsh-Healey Act applied to these helmets.  \n  63. Paragraph (a) of the Walsh-H ealey Act requires the contractor, \nUNICOR’s Electronics Mfg. and Plastics Program, to pay minimum wages. \nThis provision was violated. Claimants were paid only $1.00 an hour for \nregular time and $2.00 an hour for overtime. \n         64. Paragraph (b) of the  Walsh-Healey Act requires the contractor, \nUNICOR’s Electronics Mfg. and Plast ics Program, to work its em ployees \nonly 40 hours a week. This provision was also violated. \n                                                 \n2 See 18 U.S.C. § 1761 (b) stating: “Thi s chapter shall  not apply to …  commodities \nmanufactured in a Federal … institution fo r use by the Federal Governm ent,” and (c) \nwhich states: “In addition to the exceptions set forth in subsection (b) of this section…” \nThe Walsh-Healey Act states: “… no convict  labor will be employed by the contractor \n…except  that this section … shall not a pply  to convict labor which satisfies the \nconditions of section 1761(c) of T itle 18.”  UNICOR comes within this W alsh-Healey \nexemption because it is referenced in both paragraphs (b) and (c) of 18 U.S.C. § 1761.  \n3 See Exhibit 2, UNICOR contracts awarded and confirming how Walsh-Healey applies. \n  22\n\n         65. Paragraph (d) of the  Walsh-Healey Act requires the contractor, \nUNICOR’s Electronics Mfg. and Plastics Program, to certify that no part of \nsuch  contract will be performed  under  working conditions which are \nunsanitary or hazardous or dangerous to the health and safety of employees. \nThis provision was violated in ways that are shocking to the conscience.  \n         66. It is incontrovertible that the terms of the Walsh-Healey Act apply \nto this contract and all of these provisi ons were violated. Notwithst anding \nthis overt conduct, Defendant’s UNI COR supervisors certified compliance \nwith Walsh-Healey Act provisions to the U.S. Department of Defense. \nPhysical Injuries \n \n  67. Morgellons disease is a skin disorder characterized by disfiguring \nsores and crawling sensations on and under the skin. From these severe skin \nsores, strange fibers are \"growing\" or  protruding out of t he sores. There is \nstrong data indicating that this diso rder is assciated with nanotechnol ogy, \nwhich refers to applied science involving the control of matter on an atomic \nor molecular scale. The outer casing of  its fiber specimen is made of high \ndensity polyethylene, the same mat erial used for fiber optics. Morgellons \ndisease was unknown prior to Hurricane  Rita. Chevron Chemical's ethylene \nplant in Port Arthur, Texas manufactures this material, which was caught in \nHurricane Rita’s storm surge and transported inland, contaminating water. \n  23\n\n  68.  Symptoms  of Morgellons dis ease  include skin rashes or sores \naccompanied by intense itching; threads, fibers, or black speck-like materials \nbeneath the skin; crawling sensations  on and under the skin akin to tiny \nworms, sometimes with biting and stinging sensations. There are also mental \nsymptoms including inability to concen trate and difficulty with short-term \nmemory.  There is al so  joint  and m uscle  pain, changes in vi sion,  mental \nconfusion, fatigue and changes in skin texture and color. \n  69. There is presently no cure for Morgellons disease. The man-made \nfibers  are immune to antibodies a nd  similar  remedies. The high density \ncasing will not burn until temperatures reach 1750 degrees Fahrenheit. Many \nclaimants are experiencing all of the symptoms of Morgellons disease.   \n  70. Stachybotrys Chartarum, referred to as  black mold, entered the \nprison through the roof, through window calking and by way of ventil ation \nducts. Claimants lived in close proximity and suffered long term exposure to \nthis mold, making inhaling of its harmful spores virtually unavoidable.  \n  71. Symptoms of black m old include shortness of breath, breathing \nproblems,  tightness in chest, chroni c  fatigue, watery and reddened eyes,  \nmemory  problems,  mood  swings and ski n  sores in a reas  subject  to \nperspiration. Once this mold becomes rooted in the respiratory track or the \nlungs, it is almost impossible to dislodge and results i n chronic, typically \n  24\n\nirreversible lung damage and atte ndant physical limitations caused by a n \nimpaired ability to breath. Claimants are experiencing all of these symptoms. \n  72. MRSA Staph is a highly contagious bacterium that spreads b y \ncontact. It could have been picked up  from one of the filthy mats used by a  \nprior occupant of the cell. Symptoms include pimples or boils, red pus filled \nskin sores, shortness of breath, feve r and chills and urinary track problem s. \nIf MRSA Staph is not diag nosed and treated at th e outset, it can spread  \nquickly and become life threatening, particularly when it is drilling holes in \nthe lungs and poisoning t he bloodstream. Claimants are experiencing all of \nthese symptoms and there was no medical care available to treat this disease. \nFurthermore, these symptoms did not arise prior to Hurricane Rita’s arrival. \n  73. H. pylori (i.e. helicobacter pylori)  is a bact eria that infects th e \nstomach’s lining. It is caught by ingesting feces. Many people have h. pylori \nand typically this disease is harmless. When the bacterial infection becomes \ndeeply embedded, it can cause these  symptoms; a bloated feeling after a \nsmall meal, excessive gas or burping, a  change in appetite with weight loss, \nnausea, bloody diarrhea, and pain in  the abdomen which goes away when \nyou eat or drink. Cl aimants are experiencing all of these sym ptoms from h \npylori and these sym ptoms did not exist  before they were forced to drink \ncontaminated water. If not treated, H  pylori can cause sto mach ulcers and \n  25\n\nstomach cancers. Many claimants are at risk of contracting stomach ulcers \nand stomach cancer after being forced  to drink contaminated water for a \nprolonged period of time with no access to medical care.   \n  74. Respiratory problems can result from  breathing and re-breathing \nair containing hazardous industrial chemicals. Claimants were overexposed \nand repeatedly exposed to hazardous vapors, mists and airborne solid matter \nthat can cause long term  breathing and  lung problems and, in som e cases, \nneurological damage. Many claimants are experiencing these symptoms. \n  75.  Claimants suffered from   high  stress.  When the hippocam pus \nportion of our brain is subjected to large amounts of stress, a hormone called \nglucocorticiods  is released throug hout  the body. The daily loading of \nenormous stress for a prolonge d and uninterrupted period of time releases \nthis hormone and, in the process the  memory storing function performed by \nthe hippocampus portion of the brain is damaged and im paired, leading to \nloss of memory. Claimants are all at risk of memory loss due to the extended \nperiod of high stress to which they were all subjected.  \n  76. Sleep Deprivation will severely impair the human body's ability to \nmetabolize glucose, which can lead to early-stage Diabetes Type 2. Lack of \nsleep will also cause blurred vision, impaired motor skills and irritability. All \nof these physical and behavior impairments were widely experienced. \n  26\n\nMental Injuries \n  77. The mental strain caused by this ordeal has left indeli ble scars \nupon  claimants that are inst antly  triggered  by the sm allest  reminders. \nClaimants have experienced depression, lack of self esteem and insomnia as \na direct result of this ordeal. These mental states are manifested in a reduced \nability to function, a higher incidence of diabetes 2 and abandonment issues. \n  78.  Upon inform ation  and belief, additiona l  mental  illnesses are \nexpected  to becom e  apparent during  the  course of discovery, and these \nmental illnesses are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully printed here.   \nObstructing Access to Courts \n79.  Defendant’s agents were well  aware  of their tortious conduct. \nThey  clearly  threatened and, in so me  cases, actually retaliated against \nclaimants for filing a tort claim. Over t sanctions consisted of baring them \nfrom continuing to work overtime. More subtle forms of retaliation consisted \nof taking them off a desirable job and moving them to a more stressful task.  \n80. For those that braved these thr eats and filed a tort claim anyway , \nthey received a denial decision from the Regional Counsel. These letters are \ndesigned to do more than just deny them administrative relief. The clai m is \ncharacterized as frivolous and the tone of the letter is such, it is calculated to \n  27\n\ndiscourage claimants and cause them  as well as others from  pursuing these \ntort claims. This is precisely the result achieved.  \n81. Once denial letters were issued and began circulating through \nthe prison, the sacrifices made to pursue these claims no longer seemed \nworthwhile, given the attitude reflected in these denial decisions.  \n82. As late as October of 2007, with only a month before the two \nyear  statute  of lim itation  would to ll,  not one tort cl aim  had been \npursued. These tort filings only became possible once counsel was able \nto become involved and do the Form 95’s for them. \nClaim 1 – Negligence \n83. The elements of negligence incl ude: (1) Plaintiff must show that \nDefendant owed them a duty of care; (2) the Defendant breached that duty of \ncare; (3) Plaintiffs suffered damage s and (4) Defendants’ breach was  the \nproximate cause of Plaintiffs’ damages.   \n  84. The existence of a duty is question of law to be decided from facts \nsurrounding the occurrence in question. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §  4042 (a)(2), \ntitled Duties of Bureau of Prisons, Defendant has a duty to provi de suitable \nquarters,  and provi de  for  the  safekeeping, care and subsistence   of all \npersons held in custody by the Federal Bureau of Prisons. This dut y of care \nis further defined in the standards of the American Correctional Association. \n  28\n\n  85. A condemned building is not suitable quarters within the meaning \nof 18 U.S.C. § 4042 (a)(2). Com pelling claimants to drink contam inated \nwater with brown matter floating violates the duty of Defendants to provide \nfor their care and safekeeping.  A number of mandatory standards set by the \nAmerican Correctional Association were not followed.  \n  86. Claimants suffered damages in the form of diseases and infections \ncontracted from drinking this contaminated water. Defendants’ movement of \nclaimants back to Beaumont to produce military helmets is a self serving and \nwholly inadequate reason for com promising claimants’ health and it is th e \nsole and proximate cause of claimants’ damages. As a re sult, Defendant is \nliable to claimants for negligence.   \nClaim 2 – Walsh – Healey Act Violations \n \n  87. Claimants are covered by protec tions in the Walsh – Healey Act. \nIf a legislative enactment is violated by doing a prohibited act, or failing to \ndo a required act, the interest of the individual sought to be protected by this \nstatute has been violated. This rule is  more than merely a canon of statutory \n4\ninterpretation. The disregard of a statute is a wrongful act and a tort.   \n  88.  Under § (a) [41  U.S.C.  § 35(a)] of the Walsh – Healey Act,  \nDefendant is required to pay claimants minimum wages. In paying claimants \n                                                 \n4 See Kardon v. National Gypsum Co., 69  F.Supp. 512, 513 (D.C. Pa. 1946).   See also \nVol. 2, Restatement Torts, § 286.  \n  29\n\nonly $1 an hour for regular time, Defe ndant violated § (a) of the Walsh – \nHealey Act by failing to do a required act. \n  89.  Under § (b) [41 U.S.C. § 35( b)] of the Walsh – Healey Act, \nDefendant is prohibited from requiring claimants to work in excess of forty \nhours  a week without their voluntary  consent  to do so. Claim ants  were \ncompelled to work overtime o n their daily shift, where they worked nearly \ndouble shifts during the week, and they  were compelled to work weekends. \nAll of this overtime and weekend work  exceeded the forty hour work week. \nAll  of thi s  overtime  work was invol untary.  Defendant vi olated  § (b) by \ndoing a prohibited act.  \n  90. Defendant paid claimants only  $2 an hour for overtim e, which is \nalso way below the m inimum wage and constitutes a third violation of the  \nWalsh Healey Act and the second time they failed to do a required act.  \n  91. Under § (d) [41 U.S.C. § 35(d)]  of the Walsh – Healey Act, the \nbuildings used for manufactu ring goods are required to be non-hazardous \nand sanitary, and there must be nothing unsafe about the working conditions. \nClaimants were compelled to work in a building that was not adequately \nventilated and they were not issued the proper safety apparel specified by the \nproduct safety data sheets used for manufacturing helmets. Defendants were \nsubjected to overexposure and repeat ed long term exposure of hazardous \n  30\n\nvapors, mists and microscopic solid matter and are experiencing eye, s kin, \nlung, kidney and neurological damage due to this long term proximity. \n  92. Defendants refused to do tw o acts required of them  under the \nWalsh – Healey Act and they have done  three overt acts prohibi ted by this \nlaw. The acts required but not performed consisted of: (1) paying $1 an hour \nfor regular time instead of the minimum wage, and (2) paying $2 an hour for \novertime instead of a wage above th e minimum wage. The three overt acts \nprohibited consisted of requiring claimants to work in excess of 40 hours a \nweek  under duress,   failing to provide   a properly ventilated work area  \nsuitable for manufacturing the finished end product and failing to provide  \nproper safety apparel to protect them from hazardous chemical ingredients. \nClaim 3 – Reckless Disregard for Welfare / Deliberate Indifference \n93.  The torts  reckless  disregard for the welfar e  of another   and \ndeliberate indifference overlap one another. Because of this co mmonality, \nboth types of torts are considered together as one claim.  \n94. The definition of  reckless disregard for the welfare of another  in \nTexas exceeds negligence and requires  such want of care as to equate to  \ngross negligence. In proving this claim, there is no requirement to prove any \nmental state of the person whose acts or  omissions are subject to the claim. \nReckless disregard for one’ s welfare can be proven  externally by acts and  \n  31\n\nomissions and the readily foreseeable consequences flowing from those acts \n5\nand omissions, leading up to and occurring at the time of the incident.  \n95.  Deliberate  indifference  is invoked to describe system ic \ndeficiencies and can also be proven through external evidence either through \nan established pattern or  by systemic def iciencies which make widespread \n6\nsuffering  inevitable.   Like reckless disregard for another’s welfare, \ndeliberate indifference requires conduct more blameworthy than negligence.  \n  96. Common sense and everyday  experience informs us that you \ncannot  compel a p erson  to  work from 7:30 a.m .  to 9 p.m .  without \nextracting a huge toll from them physically, emotionally and mentally. \nThis inherently stressful situation is exacerbated by compelling them to \nwork in a building that traps and holds hazar dous chemical vapors and \nby not providing them with the safety apparel specified by the product \nsafety data sheets. Finally, letting them return to a condemned building, \nwhere they are  forced to drink contaminated water, take an ice cold \nshower and allowing less than an hour  of time for thei r personal needs \nis calculated to keep them agitated and deprive them of time to heal.  \n                                                 \n5 See Rice v. Schiller, 241 S.W. 2nd 330, 338 (Tex. App. 1951) “reckless disregard of the \nrights of others does not depend upon the actual  mental state of the person whose acts or \nomissions are complained of, but is determined externally by his acts and conduct and the \nfacts and circumstances in evidence before  you leading up to and at the tim e of the \naccident in question.” This authority has been overruled on another, unrelated matter. The \npoint of law referenced herein has been cited and reaffirmed on several occasions.  \n6 See Ruiz v. Estelle, 503 F. Supp. 1265, 1329 (D.C. Tex. 1980)  \n  32\n\n  97. Throughout this time, there was no func tioning sick bay or \nmedical care available b ecause the prison was cl osed and the medical \ncare area in particular had sustaine d extensive water damage and mold \ninfestation, necessitating  the fact th at this had to be closed because it \nwas in no state to pass inspection.  \n  98.  Subjecting  anyone  to  this  regimen  is self ev ident  proof of \nboth deliberate indifference and a reckless disregard for their welfare.   \nClaim 4 – Cruel and Unusual Punishment (as a Constitutional Tort) \n  99. Routine discomfort is part of the penalty that criminal offenders \npay for committing crim es. Only those  deprivations denying “the m inimal \ncivilized  measure of life' s  necessities”  are sufficiently grave to form the \nbasis of an Eighth Amendment violation.” It is  obduracy and wantonness, \nnot  inadvertence or error i n  good f aith  that  characterize the con duct \n7\nprohibited by the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause …”   \n  100.   The   Supreme Court has held   that  the Eighth Am endment’s \nprohibition against cruel and unusual punishment will be violated if prison \nofficials expose an inmate to a conditio n that poses an unreasonable risk to \n8\nthat person’s future health.  This violates the Eighth Amend ment because it \n                                                 \n7 Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 298 – 299 (1991) [Emphasis in original text.] \n8 See Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33 (1993) “I t is “cruel and unusual punishment \nto hold convicted criminals in unsafe conditions.”    \n  33\n\namounts  to an unnecessary and wanton  infliction  of pai n  contrary t o \n9\ncontemporary standards of decency.   \n10 11\n  101. Allegations of contam inated water   and toxic fum es    have \nboth been held to state an Eighth Amendment claim. \n         102.  Claimants  have been afflicted with   a peculiarly unique set of \ndiseases. The evidence is irrefutable that Hurricane Rita brought black mold \ninto this prison and claimants’ health has been seriously compromised by the \ndamage  of these spores to the l ungs  and the entire respiratory track. \nMorgellons  disease was unknown until   the hurri cane’s  storm  surge and \npowerful winds blew this man made material inland and contam inated the \nwater. Just one of these diseases would be sufficient to make out an Eighth \nAmendment claim. The harm posed by both diseases is totally debilitating. \n        103.  With  regard  to  MRSA  Staph and H. Pylori, both diseases are \nreadily preventable. But with cold  showers and a total absence of hygiene \nand sanitation in living quarters, compounded by a lack of medical care at  \nthe prison, it was inevitable that each  disease would flourish and spread. \nBecause these diseases are preventable,  their wide-spread inflictions could  \n                                                 \n9 See Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 32 (1993).  \n10 See Jackson v. Arizona, 885 F. 2nd 639, 641 (9th Cir. 1989) and Jackson v. Duckworth, \n955 F. 2nd 21, 22 (7th Cir. 1992). \n11 Johnson-Eli v. Schoemehl, 878 F. 2nd 1043, 1054-55 (8th Cir. 1989); Cody v. Hillard,  \n599 F. Supp. 1025, 1032 (D.S.D. 1984).  \n  34\n\nnot  occur, indeed necessitated delib erate  indifference an d  a reckl ess \ndisregard for the welfare of claimants.  \n         104. Claimants have all suffered cruel and unusual punishment due to \nthe contaminated water they were for ced to drink, and the toxic chemi cal \nfumes  they were forced to breat h.  Claimants  were overexposed and \nrepeatedly exposed to hazardous and  toxic chemicals, and  none of these \ndangers can be justified as furthering any justifiable penological purpose. \nClaim 5 - Malice \n105. One definition for m alice consists of reckless disregard of the \n12\nlaw or of a person’s legal rights.    Claimants are incarcerated. Their access \nto the law is limited. As a consequence of being incarcerated, it is defined by \nacts and just as indelibly by omissions of prison staff, who hold the power to \ngive them full access, or no access, and any kind of access in between. \n106. Prison staff employed a num ber of different  strategies, ranging \nfrom outright retaliation to subtle, below the radar screen forms of retaliation \nto discourage the filing of tort claims. An overt form of retaliation consisted \nof no longer letting a claimant work ove rtime once they found out they had \njoined this lawsuit. A m ore subtle form of retaliation consi sted of giving \nthem a new and much less desirable job. Sometimes, both forms were used. \n                                                 \n12 See Black’s Law Dictionary, 8th Edition, online version, under “malice.” \n  35\n\n  107. Once denial letters began circulating through the prison, the \nsacrifices made to pursue these cl aims no longer seemed worthwhile, \ngiven the attitude reflected in these denial decisions.  \n  108. Through these practices, Defendant effectively discouraged \nthe filing of tort claims u ntil counsel came to their assistance. These \nacts and omissions were driven by a  reckless disregard for the law and \nof claimant’s legal rights, and constitute malice.  \n   109. Plaintiffs request a trial before a Judge. \n \n      WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request the following relief.   \n \n            1.  Issue  an  order  adjudging  and declaring the  pre-requisites  of th e \nFederal Tort Claim Act an d, in particular, the requirement imposed by 28 \nU.S.C.  § 1346 (b)(2) [i.e. the physiolog ical  basis for a mental disorder ]  \nsatisfied and further finding that Defendant is liable to claimants for damages.  \n            2. Declare that Plaintiffs have proven all of the elements for negligence \nand that Defendant has in fact been negligent toward claimants. \n            3. Declare that Plaintiffs have proven violations of the Walsh Healey \nAct, paragraphs (a), (b) and (d), and that Defendant is liable for damages.  \n  4. Declare that Plaintiffs have proven all elements for reckless disregard \nfor the welfare of another  and / or deliberate indifference, and that Defendant \nhas in fact been reckless and deliberately indifferent toward claimants. \n  36\n\n         5.    Declare  that  Plaintiffs  have proven all el ements  for proving the \nconstitutional tort of cruel and unusual punishments and that Defendant has in \nfact  arbitrarily and without good  cause  imposed cr uel  and unusual  \npunishments upon claimants.  \n         6. Declare that Plaintiffs have proven all elements for malice and that \nDefendant has in fact acted with malice toward claimants.  \n          7. Declare that for all claimants, the measure of damages is $250,000 per \nclaimant.  \n          8. Find that counsel has taken this case on a contingency fee basis and is \nentitled to attorney fees as set forth in the Federal Tort Claim Act, up to but not \nexceeding 25% of the award  granted to claimants. Pl aintiffs further request \nreimbursement of litigation fees of a  non-hourly nature, such as travel and  \nexpert witness fees.  \n          9. A Trustee should be appointed to issue awards granted to claimants.         \n           10.  Claimants  seek  any  other  relief  developed  by t he  evidence  and \nconsistent  with  allegations  pled  herein,  which is necess ary,  expedient or  \nconsequential to the relief herein requested. \n                                                             Respectfully submitted; \n \n            /s/ Norman L.
