Jones III\n:\nv. :\n:\nTHOMAS DECKER, et al., :\nRespondents :\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER\nAugust 10, 2009\n This matter is before the Court in what the respondents correctly note is a\nrather unique procedural posture.  Before the Court are the Amended Petition for\nWrit of Habeas Corpus and Complaint for Declaratory Relief (Doc. 9) of\npetitioners Alexander Alli and Elliot Grenade as well as the petitioners’ Motion\nfor a Preliminary Injunction (Doc. 27) and Motion for Class Certification (Doc.\n17).  By this Memorandum and Order, the Court does not finally resolve the\npetitioners’ claims, but sets forth its initial legal holdings and establishes a\nframework for additional proceedings.\nI. BACKGROUND\nThe petitioners are lawful permanent residents charged by the Bureau of\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement with being deportable from the United\n1\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00698-JEJ-SF     Document 56      Filed 08/10/2009     Page 2 of 33\nStates as a result of certain criminal convictions.  In their combination habeas\npetition and civil complaint, the petitioners challenge their detention during the\npendency of removal proceedings pursuant to the mandatory detention provisions\nof Section 236(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), 8 U.S.C. §\n1226(c).  As of the date of the filing of their amended petition, Alli and Grenade\nhad been detained for approximately 9 months and 20 months respectively.1  The\npetitioners seek a declaration that the failure to provide them with a hearing at\nwhich the government must justify their continued detention violates the INA and\nthe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  The petitioners also seek an\norder directing the government to conduct such hearings and have moved for a\npreliminary injunction directing the government to conduct their hearings within\n14 days.  \nIn addition to their individual claims, the petitioners propose to represent a\nclass of all lawful permanent residents in Pennsylvania, or alternatively in this\njudicial district, who are or will be subject to detention for 6 months or more under\n§ 1226(c) without an individualized hearing at which the government must justify\ndetention.  As classwide relief, the petitioners seek a declaration that the failure to\n1 The parties dispute how much of Grenade’s detention is actually pursuant to § 1226(c). \nFor the reasons explained below, however, the Court need not resolve this dispute now.  \n2\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00698-JEJ-SF     Document 56      Filed 08/10/2009     Page 3 of 33\nprovide all class members who are or will be detained under § 1226(c) for 6\nmonths or more with individualized detention hearings violates the INA and due\nprocess.  \nII. DISCUSSION 2\nA. Petitioners’ Individual Claims\nThe detention of an alien pending a decision on whether he is to be removed\nfrom the United States is governed by § 236 of the INA, codified at 8 U.S.C. § \n1226.  Under § 1226(a), the Attorney General (now the Secretary of Homeland\nSecurity)3 is granted discretion to detain the alien or release the alien on bond and\nwith conditions.  Under § 1226(c), however, the Attorney General “shall take into\ncustody any alien who... is deportable by reason of having committed” certain\naggravated offenses.  8 U.S.C. § 1226(c)(1)(B) (emphasis added).  Because of\ntheir prior offenses falling within the scope of the that section, the petitioners in\nthis case have been mandatorily detained pursuant to § 1226(c).  \n2 No party disputes the jurisdiction of the Court to consider this action.  See Demore v.\nKim, 538 U.S. 510, 516-17 (2003); Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 688 (2001); DeSousa v.\nReno, 190 F.3d 175, 182-183 (3d Cir.1999); Sandoval v. Reno, 166 F.3d 225, 238 (3d Cir. 1999).\n3 The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred most immigration-related functions of\nthe Attorney General to the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.  See Homeland\nSecurity Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135.  For the sake of convenience,\nthroughout this opinion we use the term Attorney General as contained in the statute.  \n3\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00698-JEJ-SF     Document 56      Filed 08/10/2009     Page 4 of 33\nIn considering the petitioners’ challenge to their detention, we must start\nfrom the Supreme Court’s holding in Demore v. Kim, 538 U.S. 510 (2003), that\nmandatory detention during removal proceedings under § 1226(c), without an \nindividualized bond hearing, does not violate due process.  In that case, the Court\nheld that “Congress, justifiably concerned that deportable criminal aliens who are\nnot detained continue to engage in crime and fail to appear for their removal\nhearings in large numbers, may require that persons such as respondent be\ndetained for the brief period necessary for their removal proceedings.”  Id. at 513;\nsee also id. at 526 (noting the “longstanding view that the Government may\nconstitutionally detain deportable aliens during the limited period necessary for\ntheir removal proceedings”).  The Court found that the petitioner’s six-month\ndetention under § 1226(c) did not violate due process.    \nIn doing so, the Court distinguished its prior decision in Zadvydas v. Davis,\n533 U.S. 678 (2001), wherein the Court considered a due process challenge to\ndetention of aliens under 8 U.S.C. § 1231, which governs detention following a\nfinal order of removal.  Under § 1231(a)(6), when an alien who has been ordered\nremoved is not in fact removed during the 90-day statutory “removal period,” that\nalien “may be detained beyond the removal period” in the discretion of the\nAttorney General.  In order to avoid “serious constitutional concerns” raised by\n4\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00698-JEJ-SF     Document 56      Filed 08/10/2009     Page 5 of 33\nthe indefinite detention possible under the statute, the Zadvydas court construed §\n1231 to authorize continued detention of an alien following the 90-day removal\nperiod for only such time as is reasonably necessary to secure the alien’s removal. \n533 U.S. at 699.   Based on the views of Congress, and for the sake of uniform\nadministration in federal courts, the Zadvydas court held that an alien’s detention\nfor more than six months after the issuance of a final order of removal is\npresumptively unreasonable, and that after this six-month period, once the alien\nprovides good reason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of removal\nin the reasonably foreseeable future, the government must respond with evidence\nsufficient to rebut that showing and demonstrate that detention remains\nreasonable.  Id. at 701.  \nIn Demore, the court distinguished Zadvydas on two grounds.  First, in\nZadvydas, the aliens challenging their detention were ones for whom removal was\nno longer practically attainable, and, therefore, continued detention did not serve\nthe purpose of § 1231, which is prevent aliens from fleeing prior to their removal. \nBy contrast, the Court found that detention pursuant to § 1226(c) “necessarily\nserves the purpose of preventing deportable criminal aliens from fleeing prior to or\nduring their removal proceedings, thus increasing the chance that, if ordered\nremoved, the aliens will be successfully removed.”  Id. at 527-28.  Second, while\n5\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00698-JEJ-SF     Document 56      Filed 08/10/2009     Page 6 of 33\nthe period of detention at issue in Zadvydas was “indefinite” and “potentially\npermanent,” 533 U.S., at 690-691, the Court  found that the detention at issue in\nDemore was of a much shorter duration.  538 U.S. at 528.  The Demore court\nnoted that “in 85% of the cases in which aliens are detained pursuant to § 1226(c),\nremoval proceedings are completed in an average time of 47 days and a median of\n30 days,” and that “[i]n the remaining 15% of cases, in which the alien appeals the\ndecision of the Immigration Judge to the Board of Immigration Appeals, appeal\ntakes an average of four months, with a median time that is slightly shorter.”  Id. at\n529; see also id. at 530 (stating “[i]n sum, the detention at stake under § 1226(c)\nlasts roughly a month and a half in the vast majority of cases in which it is\ninvoked, and about five months in the minority of cases in which the alien chooses\nto appeal”).  \nIn this case, the respondents stress the holding of Demore, that mandatory\ndetention under § 1226(c) is constitutional, and that, in contrast to the indefinite\nand potentially permanent detention at issue in Zadvydas, detention under §\n1226(c) has a definite end point at the conclusion of the removal proceedings.  The\npetitioners concede that brief detention under § 1226(c) is constitutional, but\nmaintain that “prolonged” detention, which they argue presumptively begins at six\nmonths, raises serious constitutional concerns.  The petitioners argue that to avoid\n6\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00698-JEJ-SF     Document 56      Filed 08/10/2009     Page 7 of 33\nconstitutional problems, § 1226(c) must be interpreted to permit mandatory\ndetention only for a brief period of time – six months – and that detention after\nthis is permitted only after a bond hearing is held under § 1226(a).  \nIn this case, the Court concurs with the growing consensus within this\ndistrict and, indeed it appears throughout the federal courts, that prolonged\ndetention of aliens under § 1226(c) raises serious constitutional concerns.  See,\ne.g., Tijani v. Willis, 430 F.3d 1241, 1242 (9th Cir. 2005); Ly v. Hansen, 351 F.3d\n263, 267-68 (6th Cir. 2003); Prince v. Mukasey, 593 F. Supp. 2d 727, 734 (M.D.\nPa. 2008).  Although mandatory detention under § 1226(c) serves the statutory\npurpose of guaranteeing an alien’s presence at removal proceedings, prolonged\ndetention contravenes the intent of Congress that such proceedings proceed\nexpeditiously.  Ly, 351 F.3d at 269; see also Patel v. Zemski, 275 F.3d 299, 304\n(3d Cir. 2001), overruled on other grounds by Demore, 538 U.S. at 516 (noting\n“[t]he current immigration laws reflect part of a growing effort by Congress to\nexpedite the removal of criminal aliens”).  Moreover, although detention under §\n1226(c) is not indefinite in that there will, at some point, be an end to removal\nproceedings, the holding of Demore that mandatory detention is constitutional\ncannot be divorced from the Supreme Court’s observation that such detention is of\na relatively short duration.  538 U.S. at 528-29.  The Demore court repeatedly\n7\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00698-JEJ-SF     Document 56      Filed 08/10/2009     Page 8 of 33\nqualified its holding by noting that mandatory detention is constitutionally\npermissible for the “brief,” id. at 513, 523, “limited,” id. at 526, 529 n.12, 531 and\n“temporary,” id. at 531, period necessary for removal proceedings.  When it moves\nbeyond the brief and limited period reasonably necessary to accomplish removal\nproceedings, mandatory detention is inconsistent with both the due process\nrequired by the Constitution and the statutory purposes of the INA.  The Court\nalso agrees with the numerous opinions which have concluded that, under the\ncanon of constitutional avoidance, § 1226(c) should be read to avoid such\nconstitutional concerns.  See, e.g., Tijani, 430 F.3d at 1242; Ly, 351 F.3d at 270;\ncf. Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 689.  The question becomes how to interpret § 1226(c)\nto meet constitutional requirements, and courts have taken divergent approaches.  \nIn Casas-Castrillon, 535 F.3d 942 (9th Cir. 2008), the Ninth Circuit\nadopted the approach urged by the petitioners here.  The court in that case\naddressed the different circumstances of an alien who was subject to § 1226(c),\nbut who had already been ordered removed and whose detention continued while\nhe judicially challenging his removal order.  The Ninth Circuit held that because\nneither § 1226(c) nor § 1231 authorizes prolonged detention pending judicial\nreview of a removal order, the alien’s continued detention could only be\nauthorized under § 1226(a), id. at 948, and that § 1226(a) must be construed as\n8\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00698-JEJ-SF     Document 56      Filed 08/10/2009     Page 9 of 33\nrequiring the Attorney General to exercise his discretion to conduct a bond\nhearing, id. at 951.  See also Tijani, 430 F.3d at 1242 (remanding case to the\ndistrict court “with directions to grant the writ unless the government within 60\ndays of this order provides a hearing to Tijani before an Immigration Judge with\nthe power to grant him bail unless the government establishes that he is a flight\nrisk or will be a danger to the community”).   The Casas court held that the\npetitioner’s seven-year detention in that case necessitated a bond hearing, but did\nnot define the parameters of what constitutes “prolonged” detention.  Id. at 950-\n51.  In this case, the petitioners urge the Court to adopt a rule that detention of six\nmonths or more under § 1226(c) is impermissibly “prolonged” and entitles an\nalien so detained to a bond hearing.  \nIn Ly v. Hansen, 351 F.3d 263 (6th Cir. 2003), the Sixth Circuit took a\ndifferent approach.  In order to avoid the serious constitutional concerns that\nwould arise from prolonged mandatory detention, the court held that § 1226(c)\nmust be construed “to include an implicit requirement that removal proceedings be\nconcluded within a reasonable time.”  Id. at 270.  The court expressly declined to\nrequire bond hearings for every alien detained under § 1226(c), noting that “[i]n\nthe majority of cases where an order of removal is promptly entered and removal\nis effected within the time allotted under Zadvydas, bond hearings are not\n9\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00698-JEJ-SF     Document 56      Filed 08/10/2009     Page 10 of 33\nrequired.”  Id.  The court also declined to establish a “bright line” test for the\nreasonable time limitation of pre-removal detention, finding that “hearing\nschedules and other proceedings must have leeway for expansion or contraction as\nthe necessities of the case and the immigration judge’s caseload warrant.”  Id. at\n271.  Instead, the Sixth Circuit instructed courts to “examine the facts of each\ncase, to determine whether there has been unreasonable delay in concluding\nremoval proceedings.”  Id.  Addressing the “question of institutional competence,”\nthe court acknowledged that “[b]y not requiring individualized bond hearings,\nfederal courts undertake to supervise the reasonability of detention only via the\nhabeas process.”  Id. at 272.  The Sixth Circuit offered three justifications for this\napproach.  First, the court noted that this was the approach taken by the Supreme\nCourt in Zadvydas.  Id.; see Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 699 (“Whether a set of\nparticular circumstances amounts to detention within, or beyond, a period\nreasonably necessary to secure removal is determinative of whether the detention\nis, or is not, pursuant to statutory authority. The basic federal habeas corpus statute\ngrants the federal courts authority to answer that question.”).  Second, “those\naliens not granted bond hearings would still file habeas petitions,” and therefore\n“federal courts will still be asked to review detention.”  Ly, 351 F.3d at 272. \nFinally, although a reasonableness standard is not as easily administrable as the\n10\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00698-JEJ-SF     Document 56      Filed 08/10/2009     Page 11 of 33\nbright-line rule adopted in Zadvydas, “courts are familiar with and regularly assess\nreasonableness as a legal standard.”  Id. at 272-73.  \nCourts within this district have adopted variations of both these approaches. \nCompare Prince, 593 F. Supp. 2d at 736 (directing that petitioner’s continued\ndetention be addressed at an already-scheduled hearing before an immigration\njudge); Wilks v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Security, C.A. No. 1:07-CV-2171, 2008\nWL 4820645, at *3 (M.D. Pa. Nov. 3, 2008) (ordering respondents to provide\npetitioner a bond hearing before an immigration judge) with Occelin v. Dist. Dir.\nfor Immigration Custom Enforcement, C.A. No. 1:09-CV-164, 2009 WL 1743742,\nat *4 (M.D. Pa. June 17, 2009) (ordering a hearing before the habeas court at\nwhich the government must justify the petitioner’s continued detention); Madrane\nv. Hogan, 520 F. Supp. 2d 654, 661-63 (M.D. Pa. 2007) (same).4   \nUpon consideration of this precedent, the Court adopts a variation of the\napproach adopted by the Sixth Circuit in Ly.  The Court construes § 1226(c) as\nauthorizing mandatory detention for the period of time reasonably necessary to\npromptly initiate and conclude removal proceedings.  If an alien detained pursuant\n4 Yet other courts in the district have ordered petitioners immediately released without an\nadministrative hearing or a hearing before the habeas court.  See, e.g., Victor v. Mukasey, C.A.\nNo. 3:08-CV-1914, 2008 WL 5061810, at *5 (M.D. Pa. Nov. 25, 2008); Nunez-Pimentel v. U.S.\nDep’t of Homeland Security, C.A. No. 1:07-CV-1915, 2008 WL 2593806, at *5 (M.D. Pa. June\n27, 2008). \n11\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00698-JEJ-SF     Document 56      Filed 08/10/2009     Page 12 of 33\nto § 1226(c) makes a showing via a habeas petition that detention is no longer\nreasonable, the alien must be afforded a hearing before the habeas court at which\nthe government bears the burden of justifying continued detention based on\ntraditional bail factors such as the alien’s risk of flight and potential danger to the\ncommunity.  \nThe Court adopts a reasonableness standard administered by federal courts\nbecause this approach avoids constitutional concerns while working the least\namount of damage to the statutory scheme Congress created.  “Statutes should be\nconstrued to avoid constitutional questions, but this interpretative canon is not a\nlicense for the judiciary to rewrite language enacted by the legislature.”  United\nStates v. Albertini, 472 U.S. 675, 680 (1985).  The canon of constitutional\navoidance is “a means of giving effect to congressional intent, not of subverting\nit.”  Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 382 (2005).  The intent of Congress in\nadopting § 1226(c) was to severely limit, if not eliminate, the discretion of the\nAttorney General to release deportable criminal aliens pending removal\nproceedings.  As the Demore court noted, Congress had before it evidence that,\nwhen the Attorney General had broad discretion to conduct individualized bond\nhearings and to release criminal aliens from custody during their removal\nproceedings when those aliens were determined not to present an excessive flight\n12\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00698-JEJ-SF     Document 56      Filed 08/10/2009     Page 13 of 33\nrisk or threat to society, other considerations such as limitations on funding and\ndetention space, affected release determinations.  538 U.S. at 519.  In addition, in\nlight of evidence that as many as one out of five criminal aliens released on bond\nabsconded prior to the completion of his removal proceedings, Congress was\nconcerned that, “even with individualized screening, releasing deportable criminal\naliens on bond would lead to an unacceptable rate of flight.”  Id. at 520.  \nThe construction of § 1226(c) adopted by the Court implements Congress’s\nintention of assuring attendance at removal proceedings by permitting mandatory\ndetention, to the extent constitutionally permissible, and connecting the duration\nof detention to the time reasonably necessary to complete such proceedings.  That\na habeas court determines whether continued detention is justified also addresses\nCongress’s concern that release decisions be based on traditional bail\nconsiderations such as risk of flight and danger to the community.  The approach\nurged by the petitioners and adopted by the Casas court, on the other hand,\nfunnels deportable criminal aliens to § 1226(a), a portion of the statute which\nCongress never intended to apply to such aliens, and requires the Attorney General\nto exercise the very discretion over release of criminal aliens which Congress\nintended to restrict.  \n13\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00698-JEJ-SF     Document 56      Filed 08/10/2009     Page 14 of 33\nSupervision of the reasonableness of detention through the habeas process\nalso provides justified protection of the alien’s liberty interest and conserves\njudicial resources.  If the remedy for unreasonable detention were an order\ndirecting a bond hearing under § 1226(a), an alien who has already demonstrated\nthat his detention is no longer reasonable would remain detained pending an initial\ncustody determination by the DHS district director, 8 C.F.R. § 236.1(d)(1), a\nhearing before an immigration judge, id., the IJ’s decision, and a potential appeal\nto the BIA, id. § 236.1(d)(3).  In addition, because discretionary bond decisions\nare not subject to direct judicial review, see 8 U.S.C. § 1226(e), the only recourse\nfor an alien dissatisfied with the outcome of his bond hearing would be to return to\ncourt again and file another habeas action.  Cf. Ly, 351 F.3d at 272.  A bond\nhearing before the habeas court avoids this circuitous and potentially lengthy\nprocess.  The habeas court’s determining whether a petitioner is entitled to release\nalso serves the “‘historic purpose of the writ,’ namely, ‘to relieve detention by\nexecutive authorities without judicial trial.’”  Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 699 (quoting\nBrown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443, 533 (1953) (Jackson, J., concurring)).   \nThe Court opts for a case-specific reasonableness standard rather than the\nsix-month bright-line rule urged by petitioners for several reasons.  First, there is\nno expression of Congress’s doubts as to the constitutionality of detention of\n14\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00698-JEJ-SF     Document 56      Filed 08/10/2009     Page 15 of 33\ndeportable criminal aliens for more than six months, even of the type found in\nZadvydas regarding aliens subject to a removal order.  See Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at\n701 (citing Juris. Statement in United States v. Witkovich, O.T. 1956, No. 295, pp.\n8-9).  Second, as the Sixth Circuit in Ly recognized, the varying circumstances of\nindividual removal proceedings make a bright-line rule inappropriate.  Ly, 351\nF.3d at 271.  Third, a reasonableness standard allows for consideration of relevant\nfactors beyond the length of detention, such as the alien’s conduct during removal\nproceedings and the likelihood that proceedings will result in an order of removal.\nA bright-line rule, and likely even a rule based solely on whether detention is\n“prolonged,” run the risk of ignoring these considerations.  \nAs support for the six-month rule that they urge, the petitioners cite to the\naverage times for completing removal proceedings relied on in Demore.  These\naverages were undoubtedly important to the holding in that case, but the Demore\ncourt also seemed to indicate that the average times are not an inflexible outer\nlimit to the constitutionality of mandatory detention without a hearing by finding\nthat the petitioner’s six-month detention, which was one month longer than\naverage, was constitutional.  See Demore, 538 U.S. at 530-31.  The petitioners also\nrely on 8 U.S.C. § 1226a, which directs the Attorney General to detain aliens\nremovable because of terrorist activities, but which provides that an alien “who\n15\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00698-JEJ-SF     Document 56      Filed 08/10/2009     Page 16 of 33\nhas not been removed under section 1231(a)(1)(A) of this title, and whose removal\nis unlikely in the reasonably foreseeable future, may be detained for additional\nperiods of up to six months only if the release of the alien will threaten the\nnational security of the United States or the safety of the community or any\nperson.”  8 U.S.C. § 1226a(a)(6).  This statute, however, addresses the concerns\nraised in Zadvydas regarding aliens already subject to removal, and for the reasons\nset forth in Demore and those discussed above, is largely inapplicable here.\nTo aid the parties in further proceedings this case, the Court will note some\nof the factors to be considered in determining the reasonableness of detention\nunder § 1226(c).  What follows, however, is by no means a conclusive or\ncomprehensive list of all potential considerations.  The Court adopts the Sixth\nCircuit’s instruction to “examine the facts of each case, to determine whether there\nhas been unreasonable delay in concluding removal proceedings.”  Ly, 351 F.3d at\n271.  \nA significant consideration is whether detention has continued beyond the\naverage times necessary for completion of removal proceedings which were\nidentified in Demore.  Although, as noted above, these averages do not mark a per\nse limit on constitutionally permissible detention under § 1226(c), they were\nimportant in defining the “brief” and “limited” period during which mandatory\n16\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00698-JEJ-SF     Document 56      Filed 08/10/2009     Page 17 of 33\ndetention is constitutional.  When detention moves beyond the time usually\nnecessary to complete removal proceedings, it becomes less likely that detention\nwithout a hearing is necessary to achieve the statutory purpose of assuring the\nalien’s attendance and expeditiously concluding removal proceedings.  See\nDemore, 538 U.S. at 532-33 (Kennedy, J. concurring) (“Were there to be an\nunreasonable delay by the INS in pursuing and completing deportation\nproceedings, it could become necessary then to inquire whether the detention is\nnot to facilitate deportation, or to protect against risk of flight or dangerousness,\nbut to incarcerate for other reasons.”).  \nA related consideration is the probable extent of future removal\nproceedings.  This factor cuts both ways.  Where the end of removal proceedings\nis relatively near, continued detention is more likely to be reasonable.  See, e.g.,\nHussain v. Mukasey, 510 F.3d 739, 743 (7th Cir. 2007) (affirming denial of a \npetition seeking release during removal proceedings where the alien filed his\npetition “with the completion of the administrative removal proceeding within\nsight,” and a decision on whether the alien was entitled to release would not come\nbefore judicial review of his removal order was completed).  On the other hand,\nwhere it can be foreseen that proceedings will continue for a prolonged period of\ntime, continued detention may be less likely to be reasonable.  See, e.g., Tijani,\n17\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00698-JEJ-SF     Document 56      Filed 08/10/2009     Page 18 of 33\n430 F.3d at 1242 (noting, in granting petitioner relief, that the “the foreseeable\nprocess” of his appeal of removal “is a year or more”).  That the foreseeable period\nof continued detention will be long is particularly relevant when it follows an\nalready prolonged period of detention.  See, e.g., Madrane, 520 F. Supp. 2d. at 667\n(noting “the forecast of additional future appeals or proceedings that could result\nin Petitioner being detained for many months in addition to the nearly three years\nhe has already been held in custody”); cf. Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 701 (stating “for\ndetention to remain reasonable, as the period of prior postremoval confinement\ngrows, what counts as the ‘reasonably foreseeable future’ conversely would have\nto shrink”).  \nThe respondents argue that future detention is too speculative to consider. \nWe disagree.  They are correct that some level of proof is necessary to consider\nprospective detention, but this is part of the habeas petitioner’s burden.  See Parke\nv. Raley, 506 U.S. 20, 34 (1992) (citing Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 468-69\n(1938) (noting “the preponderance of the evidence standard applicable to\nconstitutional claims raised on federal habeas”).  Moreover, the mere fact that\nremoval proceedings will continue, even beyond the time periods identified in\nDemore, does not necessarily mean that detention is unreasonable.  See, e.g.,\nMatthias v. Hogan, C.A. No. 4:07-CV-1987, 2008 WL 913522, at *6 (M.D. Pa.\n18\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00698-JEJ-SF     Document 56      Filed 08/10/2009     Page 19 of 33\nMar. 31, 2008) (finding that petitioner’s 7-month detention did not warrant a\nhearing even though removal proceedings were ongoing); Abdul v. U.S. Dep’t of\nHomeland Security, C.A. No. 1:07-CV-571 (M.D. Pa. Nov. 9, 2007) (finding that\npetitioner’s 10-month detention as of the date of habeas decision did not warrant\nhearing even though removal proceedings were ongoing).  As noted, prolonged\nfuture detention will be most relevant when it follows an already prolonged period\nof detention.  \nAnother factor in reasonableness determination is the likelihood that\nremoval proceedings will actually result in removal.  See Ly, 351 F.3d at 271.  The\ndetention of the petitioner in Demore was justified, in part, because he conceded\nthat he was deportable.  See Demore, 538 U.S. at 513, 522 & n.6, 531. \nConversely, courts have found detention under § 1226(c) unreasonable where an\nalien mounts a successful challenge to removal.  See, e.g., Madrane, 520 F. Supp.\n2d at 658, 660 (noting that, in habeas petition challenging alien’s removal order,\ngovernment represented that the petitioner was eligible to apply to for relief from\nremoval and that IJ had granted the alien a waiver of inadmissibility and\nadjustment of status to lawful permanent resident); cf. Ly, 351 F.3d at 271-72\n(finding detention unreasonable where petitioner was ordered removed to a\ncountry that does not have a repatriation treaty with the United States). \n19\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00698-JEJ-SF     Document 56      Filed 08/10/2009     Page 20 of 33\nFinally, another relevant consideration is the conduct of both the alien and\nthe government during removal proceedings.  In Demore, the court noted that the\npetitioner’s detention had been extended by his own request for a continuance, 538\nU.S. at 530-31, and, citing Congress’s concern with frivolous appeals that delay\ndeportation, found no constitutional prohibition against requiring aliens to make\nthe difficult choice of whether to appeal their removal at the potential cost of\nlonger detention, id. at 530 n.14.  Similarly, the Sixth Circuit in Ly cautioned that\nin considering the reasonableness of detention, “courts must be sensitive to the\npossibility that dilatory tactics by the removable alien may serve not only to put\noff the final day of deportation, but also to compel a determination that the alien\nmust be released because of the length of his incarceration. Without consideration\nof the role of the alien in the delay, we would encourage deportable criminal aliens\nto raise frivolous objections and string out the proceedings in the hopes that a\nfederal court will find the delay ‘unreasonable’ and order their release.”  Ly, 351\nF.3d at 272; see also Tavares v. Attorney General, 211 Fed. Appx. 127, 128 (3d\nCir. 2007) (affirming dismissal of Bivens action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)\nwhere alien’s 18-month detention was prolonged because “the proceedings\ninvolved two rounds of IJ decisions and appeals); Prince, 593 F. Supp. 2d at 735-\n20\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00698-JEJ-SF     Document 56      Filed 08/10/2009     Page 21 of 33\n36 (noting “petitioners ... must know that their own conduct has to be included in\ndetermining whether or not a ‘reasonable time’ was exercised by the authorities”).\nOn the other hand, aliens “should not be effectively punished for pursuing\napplicable legal remedies.”  Oyedeji v. Ashcroft, 332 F. Supp. 2d 747, 753 (M.D.\nPa. 2004).  “[A]ppeals and petitions for relief are to be expected as a natural part\nof the process.  An alien who would not normally be subject to indefinite detention\ncannot be so detained merely because he seeks to explore avenues of relief that the\nlaw makes available to him.”  Ly, 351 F.3d at 272.  While a court may examine an\nalien’s reasons for seeking relief, the government’s delays in resolving such\nappeals should not be counted against the alien.  See id. (noting “although an alien\nmay be responsible for seeking relief, he is not responsible for the amount of time\nthat such determinations may take”); Oyedeji, 332 F. Supp. 2d at 753 (“Prolonged\nincarceration for an alien whose potentially meritorious challenge to removal is\npart of a congested docket is indistinguishable from lengthy incarceration because\nthe alien’s native country refuses to issue travel documents.”).  Moreover, the\ngovernment’s own dilatory conduct is significant in determining whether removal\nproceeding are moving toward conclusion reasonably expeditiously.  See, e.g.,\nTijani, 430 F.3d at 1242 (noting that the government had sought multiple\nextensions of time in briefing petitioner’s appeal); Ly, 351 F.3d at 272 (“The mere\n21\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00698-JEJ-SF     Document 56      Filed 08/10/2009     Page 22 of 33\nfact that an alien has sought relief from deportation does not authorize the INS to\ndrag its heels indefinitely in making a decision.”).\nHaving determined that the petitioners have stated viable claims and having\nsketched a framework for further proceedings, we are left to apply that framework\nto this case.  To that end, the Court directs the parties to indicate by letter on the\ndocket, within 20 days of the date order, whether they wish to present testimony or\nevidence regarding the reasonableness of the petitioners’ detention.  Following an\nevidentiary hearing, or in lieu of one if the parties indicate that none is necessary,\nthe Court will accept additional submissions on this issue and then determine\nwhether the petitioners are entitled to a bond hearing.  Because the relief the\npetitioners seek in their petition and motion for preliminary injunction is identical,\nand because the evidence and argument directed at both submissions will be\nidentical, the Court will consolidate the hearing, if any, and further briefing on the\npreliminary injunction motion with the merits of the habeas petition.  See Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 65(a)(2).  By this order, the preliminary injunction motion will therefore be\ndenied as moot.\nB. Petitioners’ Class Claims\nAs noted above, the petitioners propose to represent a class of all lawful\npermanent residents in Pennsylvania, or alternatively in this judicial district, who\n22\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00698-JEJ-SF     Document 56      Filed 08/10/2009     Page 23 of 33\nare or will be subject to detention for 6 months or more under § 1226(c) without\nan individualized hearing at which the government must justify detention, and\nseek a classwide declaration that the failure to provide such a hearing violates the\nINA and due process.  The respondents argue that 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1) deprives\nthe Court of jurisdiction to adjudicate a class action.  For the reasons set forth\nbelow, the Court agrees that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the\npetitioners’ class claims. \n“The role of the courts in interpreting a statute is to give effect to Congress's\nintent.  Because it is presumed that Congress expresses its intent through the\nordinary meaning of its language, every exercise of statutory interpretation begins\nwith an examination of the plain language of the statute.”  United States v. Diallo,\n--- F.3d ----, 2009 WL 2342668, at *3 (3d Cir. July 31, 2009) (quoting Rosenberg\nv. XM Ventures, 274 F.3d 137, 141 (3d Cir. 2001)).  Section 1252(f)(1) provides:\nRegardless of the nature of the action or claim or of the identity of the\nparty or parties bringing the action, no court (other than the Supreme\nCourt) shall have jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the\noperation of the provisions of part IV of this subchapter, as amended by\nthe Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of\n1996, other than with respect to the application of such provisions to an\nindividual alien against whom proceedings under such part have been\ninitiated. \n23\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00698-JEJ-SF     Document 56      Filed 08/10/2009     Page 24 of 33\n8 U.S.C. §  1252(f)(1) (emphasis added).  The statute’s use of the disjunctive –\nenjoin or restrain – indicates that it is meant to bar jurisdiction over class claims\nfor more than just injunctive relief.  See Chalmers v. Shalala, 23 F.3d 752, 755 (3d\nCir. 1994) (“We see no basis to construe the disjunctive “or” in any way other than\nits plain meaning....”).  The Court must endeavor to give meaning to the term\n“restrain” and avoid an interpretation of § 1252(f)(1) which renders that term\nsuperfluous.  Rosenberg, 274 F.3d at 141-42.  \nThe question thus becomes whether declaratory relief falls within the scope\nof the meaning of “restrain.”  The ordinary meaning of “restrain” includes “to\nprevent from doing, exhibiting, or expressing something ... to limit, restrict, or\nkeep under control .... to moderate or limit the force, effect, development, or full\nexercise of,” Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary; “[t]o check, hold back, or\nprevent (a person or thing) from some course of action,” Oxford English\nDictionary; and “[t]o hold back or keep in check; control,” The American Heritage\nDictionary of the English Language, 4th Ed.  See United States v. Geiser, 527 F.3d\n288, 294 (3d Cir. 2008) (“We refer to standard reference works such as legal and\ngeneral dictionaries in order to ascertain the ordinary meaning of words.”).  \nThe Court finds that a classwide declaration that the failure to provide all\nclass members who are or will be detained under § 1226(c) for 6 months or more\n24\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00698-JEJ-SF     Document 56      Filed 08/10/2009     Page 25 of 33\nwith individualized detention hearings violates the INA and due process would\n“restrain” the operation of § 1226(c) within the plain meaning of that term.  The\npractical effect of the class-based declaration that the petitioners seek would be\nindistinguishable from the effect of a class-based injunction.  As the petitioners\nthemselves argue (see Doc. 44 at 22-23), although a declaration is a “milder form\nof relief” than an injunction, Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U.S. 452, 471 (1974)\n(quoting Perez v. Ledesma, 401 U.S. 82,  125-126 (1971) (Brennan J. in part and\ndissenting in part)), declaratory relief still has a strong persuasive effect.  See id. at\n469 (noting “a favorable declaratory judgment may nevertheless be valuable to the\nplaintiff though it cannot make even an unconstitutional statute disappear”);\nRivera Puig v. Garcia Rosario, 785 F. Supp. 278, 293 (D.P.R. 1992) (noting that a\ndeclaration “carries the moral force of an injunction”).  While a declaration may\nnot coercively enjoin the operation of § 1226(c), it would certainly restrain (limit,\nrestrict, hold back, etc.) the government’s implementation of the statute as written. \nThis is especially so because the declaration which the petitioners seek does not\nmerely declare the class members’ right to a bond hearing, but declares that the\ngovernment has committed a constitutional violation by failing to provide such a\nhearing.  (See Doc. 9 at 36.)  \n25\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00698-JEJ-SF     Document 56      Filed 08/10/2009     Page 26 of 33\nMoreover, the Declaratory Judgment Act provides that “[f]urther necessary\nor proper relief based on a declaratory judgment or decree may be granted,” 28\nU.S.C. § 2202, and such “necessary or proper relief” includes an injunction,\nSteffel, 415 U.S. at 461 n.11.  Especially given the res judicata and collateral\nestoppel effects of a declaratory judgment, a classwide declaration in this case\nwould merely be a prelude to later injunctions.  See id.; 10Alan Wright, Arthur R.\nMiller & Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice & Procedure § 23:62 (3d ed. 2008);\nsee also Stoetzner v. U.S. Steel Corp., 897 F.2d 115, 119 (3d Cir. 1990) (noting\nthat an action maintainable under both Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) and (b)(3) should\nbe treated under (b)(2) “to enjoy its superior res judicata effect”).  The classwide\ndeclaration that petitioners seek would have little practical difference from a\nclasswide injunction, and, even if it does not create precisely the same effect as an\ninjunction, such a declaration would certainly “restrain” the operation of §\n1226(c).  The petitioners may not use the procedural device of a declaratory\njudgment action to avoid the plain meaning of § 1252(f)(1).  \nThis holding is strongly supported by the Supreme Court’s opinion in\nCalifornia v. Grace Brethren Church, 457 U.S. 393 (1982).  In that case, the Court\naddressed the question of whether federal district courts were prohibited by the\nTax Injunction Act from issuing declaratory judgments holding that state tax laws\n26\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00698-JEJ-SF     Document 56      Filed 08/10/2009     Page 27 of 33\nunconstitutional.  The Tax Injunction Act employs language nearly identical to §\n1252(f)(1), providing that district courts “shall not enjoin, suspend or restrain the\n... collection of any tax under State law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy\nmay be had in the courts of such State.”  Id. at 407-08.  The Supreme Court held\nthat this language barred declaratory relief:\nInitially, we observe that the Act divests the district court not only of\njurisdiction to issue an injunction enjoining state officials, but also of\njurisdiction to take actions that “suspend or restrain” the assessment and\ncollection of state taxes. Because the declaratory judgment procedure\nmay in every practical sense operate to suspend collection of the state\ntaxes until the litigation is ended, the very language of the Act suggests\nthat a federal court is prohibited from issuing declaratory relief in state\ntax cases.  Additionally, because there is little practical difference\nbetween injunctive and declaratory relief, we would be hard pressed to\nconclude that Congress intended to prohibit taxpayers from seeking one\nform of anticipatory relief against state tax officials in federal court,\nwhile permitting them to seek another, thereby defeating the principal\npurpose of the Tax Injunction Act: to limit drastically federal district\ncourt jurisdiction to interfere with so important a local concern as the\ncollection of taxes.\nId. at 408 (citations omitted); see also Samuels v. Mackell, 401 U.S. 66, 72 (1971)\n(holding that Younger abstention bars declaratory as well as injunctive relief\nregarding pending state criminal proceedings because the declaration may be\nenforced through an injunction and because “the declaratory relief alone has\nvirtually the same practical impact as a formal injunction would”). Likewise,\ncourts have construed the similarly worded Johnson Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1342, which\n27\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00698-JEJ-SF     Document 56      Filed 08/10/2009     Page 28 of 33\nprovides that in certain circumstances district courts shall not “enjoin, suspend or\nrestrain the operation of, or compliance with” state utility rate decisions, to\nprohibit declaratory relief.  See, e.g., Brooks v. Sulphur Springs Valley Elec.\nCoop., 951 F.2d 1050, 1054 (9th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 503 U.S. 938 (1992);\nTennyson v. Gas Serv. Co., 506 F.2d 1135, 1139 (10th Cir. 1974).\nThe petitioners posit that § 1252(f)(1) bars courts, other than the Supreme\nCourt, from enjoining an unconstitutional statute, but does not bar courts from\ngranting relief from misinterpreted and unlawful government “policies and\nprocedures.”  (See Doc. 44 at 29.)  Relying on Ali v. Ashcroft, 346 F.3d 873, 886-\n87 (9th Cir. 2003), overruled on other grounds, Jama v. Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement, 543 U.S. 335 (2005), and similar cases, the petitioners argue that\nthey do not seek enjoin or restrain “the operation” of the INA but rather\n“violations” of the statute.  (Id. at 30-31.)  The Court does not find this argument\npersuasive.  To the extent the petitioners attempt to distinguish between the INA\nand the “policies and procedures” implementing the INA, the Court finds that both\nthe statute itself and the processes putting the statute into action are encompassed\nwithin the meaning of “the operation” of the INA.  Moreover, the petitioners do\nnot challenge a “violation” of the statute.  They do not appear to contest that their\ndetention is facially authorized by § 1226(c) and, at least initially, constitutionally\n28\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00698-JEJ-SF     Document 56      Filed 08/10/2009     Page 29 of 33\npermissible.  The petitioners do not seek an order that the government must follow\nits own policies.  Instead, the petitioners seek a declaration that an additional\nconstraint must be added to § 1226(c) and the government’s implementation of\nthat statute in order to avoid constitutional concerns.  Cf. United States v.\nX-Citement Video, Inc., 982 F.2d 1285, 1295 n. 6 (9th Cir.) (Kozinski, J.,\ndissenting), rev’d 513 U.S. 64 (1994) (“Constitutional narrowing seeks to add a\nconstraint to the statute that its drafters plainly had not meant to put there; it is\nakin to partial invalidation of the statute.”).  The limitation on § 1226(c) that the\npetitioners seeks to declare is required on a classwide basis undoubtedly\n“restrain[s] the operation” of that statute.  \nThe petitioners also cite to the heading of § 1252(f), “Limit on injunctive\nrelief”, as evidence that the section prohibits only class-based injunctions.  While\n“the title of a statute and the heading of a section are tools available for the\nresolution of a doubt about the meaning of a statute,” Almendarez-Torres v.\nUnited States, 523 U.S. 224, 234 (1998) (citation omitted), “[t]he title of a statute\ncannot limit the plain meaning of the text.  For interpretive purposes, it is of use\nonly when it sheds light on some ambiguous word or phrase” Pennsylvania\nDepartment of Corrections v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 212 (1998) (citation and\ninternal punctuation omitted).  As discussed above, there is no doubt that the plain\n29\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00698-JEJ-SF     Document 56      Filed 08/10/2009     Page 30 of 33\nmeaning of the jurisdictional prohibition in § 1252(f)(1) encompasses more than\njust injunctive relief, and, therefore, the heading of the section cannot be used to\nlimit the plain meaning of the text.  \nThe petitioners also point to the express inclusion of declaratory relief in §\n1252(e)(1) as an indication that Congress could have expressly included such\nrelief in § 1252(f)(1) had it so intended.  It is true that “when the plain meaning\ncannot be derived, the provision at issue must be viewed in the context of the\nstatute as a whole.”  Kaufman v. Allstate New Jersey Ins. Co., 561 F.3d 144, 155\n(3d Cir. 2009).  Section 1252(f)(1) plainly encompasses more than just injunctive\nrelief, however, and the ordinary meaning of the word “restrain” is easily broad\nenough to include declaratory relief, especially the type of declaratory relief\nsought by the petitioners, which has the same practical impact as an injunction. \nThat Congress employed different language in another portion of the statute does\nnot change this plain meaning.  \nIn sum, because the classwide declaration sought by the petitioners could so\nreadily be turned into an injunction, and because the practical effect of such\ndeclaratory relief would be essentially the same as injunctive relief, the Court\nholds that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the petitioners’ class action\ndeclaratory claims under § 1252(f)(1).  Therefore, the portion of the petitioners’\n30\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00698-JEJ-SF     Document 56      Filed 08/10/2009     Page 31 of 33\npetition seeking class relief will be dismissed, and their motion for class\ncertification will be denied.    \nIII. CONCLUSION\nTo reiterate, the Court harbors grave concerns about the prolonged\ndetention of aliens under § 1226(c).  While our holding is appropriately deferential\nto Congress’s intent, the constitutionally problematic statute has forced the\nrespondents to repeatedly interpose arguments that torture both law and logic in\nopposing habeas petitions of the type sub judice.  We have fashioned a resolution\nthat is admittedly imperfect, but which represents the best we can do given the\nstatutory and jurisprudential minefield facing us.   \nFor the foregoing reasons, the petitioners’ habeas petition will be granted in\npart to the extent that the Court construes § 1226(c) as authorizing mandatory\ndetention for the period of time reasonably necessary to promptly initiate and\nconclude removal proceedings.  Within 20 days of the date of this order, the\nparties shall indicate whether they wish to present testimony or evidence regarding\nthe reasonableness of the petitioners’ detention.  Thereafter, the Court will\ndetermine whether the petitioners shall be afforded a bond hearing.\n31\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00698-JEJ-SF     Document 56      Filed 08/10/2009     Page 32 of 33\nConsideration of the petitioners’ motion for a preliminary injunction will be\nconsolidated with the merits of their petition, and the motion will be denied as\nmoot.\nFinally, the portions of the petitioners’ habeas petition seeking class relief\nwill be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and the petitioners’\nmotion for class certification will be denied.\nNOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:\n1. Petitioners’ Amended Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and\nComplaint for Declaratory Relief (Doc 9) is GRANTED in part to the\nextent that the Court construes 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c) as indicated above;\n2. Within 20 days of the date of this Order, the parties shall indicate by\nletter on the docket whether they wish to present testimony or\nevidence regarding the reasonableness of the petitioners’ detention \n3. Petitioners’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction (Doc. 27) is\nconsolidated with the merits of their Amended Petition for Writ of\nHabeas Corpus and therefore DENIED as moot; \n4. The portions of the Petitioners’ Amended Petition for Writ of Habeas\nCorpus and Complaint for Declaratory Relief (Doc 9) seeking class\nrelief are DISMISSED for lack of subject matter jurisdiction; and \n32\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00698-JEJ-SF     Document 56      Filed 08/10/2009     Page 33 of 33\n5. Petitioners’ Motion for Class Certification (Doc. 17) is DENIED.\n/s/ John E. Jones III              \nJohn E. Jones III\nUnited States District Judge\n33",

Respondents' Motion for Reconsideration (Doc. 91) of this Court's \nJanuary 26, 2010 Memorandum and Order (Doc. 88) is DENIED.' \n'This Court finds that there is no necessity to correct a manifest error of law or fact or newly \ndiscovered evidence that warrants reconsideration of its January 26, 20 I 0 Order determining that \nGrenade made the necessary showing via his habeas petition that his detention no longer was \nreasonable such that he was entitled to a bond hearing before this Court.  See HarseDC  orp. v. \nZlotnicki, 779 F.2d 906, 909 (3d eiL 1995) (\"The purpose of a motion for reconsideration is to \ncorrect manifest errors of law or fact or to present newly discovered evidence . ..\" )  Moreover, the \nissuance of a bond determination by the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement \n(\"ICE\") Office on January 29, 2010 did not divest this Court of its jurisdiction to conduct the bond \nhearing scheduled by the January 26 Order inasmuch as the fact that ICE set a bond did not convert \n(continued ... ) \n\n2.  Pursuant to the Stipulation entered into by counsel on the record before \nthis Court on February 17,20 I 0, a transcript of which is attached hereto, \non or before March 15,20 I 0, counsel for Respondents shall file a status \nreport indicating whether the conditions of the Stipulation have been met \nsuch that Grenade has been released. \n3.  An extension of the deadline set forth in paragraph 2 above may be \ngranted upon motion. \n4.  This Court retains jurisdiction pending further order of court. \nstlohn E. lones III \nJohn E. Jones III \nUnited States District Judge \nl( ... continued) \nthis Court's proceeding into a review cfthat detennination.  Rather, this Court maintained \njurisdiction as a habeas court to conduct a hearing at which the government would bear the burden of \njustifying Grenade's continued detention based on traditional bail factors such as potential risk of \nflight and danger to the community in the event of release. \n2 \n\n1 \n1  IN  THE  UNITED  STATES  DISTRICT  COURT \nfOR  THE  MIDDLE  DISTRICT  OF  PENNSYLVANIA \n2 \nALEXANDER  ALLI  and  ELLIOT \n3  GRENADE,  on  behalf  of \nthemselves  and  all others \n4  similarly  situated,  Case  No .  4:09-CV-00698 \nPetitioners  (Judge  Jones) \n5 \nvs . \n6 \nTHOMAS  DECKER,  et  al . , \n7  Respondents \n8 \n9 \nTRANSCRIPT  OF  PROCEEDINGS \n10  IN  RE :  STIPULATION \n11  Before:  HONORABLE  JOHN  E.

Shuey,  RMR,  CRR \nU.S.  Official  Court  Reporter \n\n2 \n1  THE  COURT:  We 're  assembled  in  the  matter  of  AlIi  and \n2  Grenade  versus  Decker,  et  al.  Counsel,  would  you  enter  your \n3  appearances,  starting  with  counsel  for  the  petitioner  or \n4  petitioners. \n5  MS.  ANELLO:  Your  Honor,  Farrin  Anello  for  the \n6  petitioner. \n7  MS.  RABINOVITZ:  And  Judy  Rabinovitz  for  the \n8  petiti oner. \n9  MR.  ATKINSON:  Good  morning.  Your  Honor,  Theodore \n10  Atkinson  for  the  respondent,  the  United  States . \n11  THE  COURT:  Very  well .  And  welcome,  again,  to \n12  counsel .  The  record  should  indicate that  the  Court  has  had \n13  extensive  discussions  with  counsel  in  chambers. \n14  First  I ' ll note  that  the  Court  indicated  to  counsel \n15  off  the  record  and  wi ll now  place  on  the  record  t hat  the  Court \n16  is  inclined  to  and.  in  fact ,  will  deny  the  recentl y  fil ed \n17  motion  for  reconsideration  that  has  been  filed  by  the \n18  respondents  in  this  matter.  With  that  being  the  case,  the \n19  Court  requested  that  there  be  some  dialogue  between  the  parties \n20  in  this  case  that  would  potenti all y  lead  to  a  resolution. \n21  Now,  in  our  most  recent  conversation,  it was  indicated \n22  that  counsel  would,  in  particular,  speak  to  -- petitioner 's \n23  counsel  would  speak  to Mr.  Grenade.  Do  we  have  the  framework \n24  of  an  agreement  at  this  point? \n25  MS.  ANELLO :  Yes,  Your  Honor. \n\n3 \n1  THE  COURT:  All  right.  Why  don 't  we  have  Mr .  Atkinson \n2  place  on  the  record  what  ICE  is  proposing  to  do  in  this  case. \n3  Mr .  Atkinson . \n4  MR.  ATKINSON :  One  moment,  Your  Honor. \nS  THE  COURT:  Take  your  time. \n6  MR.  ATKINSON:  Your  Honor,  what  ICE  has  agreed  would \n7  form  the  framework  of  a  settlement  agreement  in  this  mat ter  or \n8  at  least  an  agreement  on  the  terms  of  a  bond  given  the  Court ' s \n9  exercise  of  jurisdiction  under  habeas  is  as  follows: \n10  First,  there  would  be  a  -- Mr.  Grenade  would  be \n11  released  without  the  posting  of  a  cash  bond. \n12  Second,  he  would  be  required  to  participate  in  the \n13  ISAP  program,  which  stands  for  the  Intensive  Supervision \n14  Appearance  Program,  which  is  maintained  and  operated  by  ICE  and \n15  its agents.  That  would  include  the  monitoring  through  an \n16  electronic  monitoring  device,  such  as  an  ankle  bracelet  or \n17  other  appropriate  device  used  by  ISAP  or  ICE . \n18  Three,  ICE  may  find  it necessary,  prior  to  the  entry \n19  of  a  bond,  to  set  additional  terms  and  conditions  regarding \n20  reporting  or  monitor ing  with  regard  to  Elliot  Grenade . \n21  All  of  this  would  be  conditioned  upon  Mr .  Grenade \n22  finding  a  permanent  residence  in  New  York  prior  to  his  release \n23  so  that  ICE  could  effectively  locate  him,  know  where  he  is at, \n24  and  which  address  is  required  for  successful  participation  in \n25  the  ISAP  program. \n\n4 \n1  I  believe  that  is  the  general  framework  of  the  bond \n2  that  ICE  is willing  to  accept  to  resolve  this  case. \n3  THE  COURT:  All  right .  Do  you  want  to  respond  for \n4  petitioner? \n5  MS .  ANELLO:  Yes,  Your  Honor .  Mr .  Grenade  would \n6  accept  those  terms  and  also  would  ask  that  this  Court  maintain \n7  jurisdiction over  the  case  so  that  we  could  revisit  this  issue \n8  if in  the  event  he  is  not  able  to  find  an  appropriate  permanent \n9  residence. \n10  MR.  ATKINSON:  Your  Honor,  I 'm sorry,  I  wrote  it down \n11  and  yet  I  still may  have  forgotten  and  I  just  want  to  make  sure \n12  the  record  is clear,  this  also  would  require  that  he  find \n13  residence  in  New  York  because  that 's  the  only  location  to  which \n14  there' s  any  demonstrable  ties  and  at  least  that 's  where  his \n15  proceedings  are  and  where  he ' s  being  detained  right  now . \n16  THE  COURT:  As  we  discussed  in  chambers,  \"residence\" \n17  would  constitute,  as  the  Court  understands  it,  someplace  that \n18  has  a  dedicated  address,  not  a  group  center,  shelter,  et \n19  cetera,  but  a  place  where  he  can  be  appropriately  monitored. \n20  Is  that  ICE ' s  position? \n21  MR.  ATKINSON:  That 's  correct,  Your  Honor. \n22  THE  COURT:  What  I  proposed  in  chambers,  as  counsel \n23  knows  and  we ' ll revisit  it on  the  record,  is  that  and  I 'm \n24  certainly  willing  to  continue  and  maintain  jurisdiction,  ret ain \n25  jurisdiction  in  this  case,  but  I  proposed  a  20-day  period  for  a \n\n5 \n1  status  report.  Does  that  still work  for  everybody? \n2  MR.  ATKINSON:  It does,  Your  Honor. \n3  MS.  ANELLO:  Yes,  Your  Honor . \n4  THE  COURT:  All  right.  So  what  I  would  propose  is \n5  that  I  will  promulgate  an  order.  It may  take  a  couple  days \n6  because  as  I  expressed  to counsel  in  chambers,  I 'm going  to  be \n7  in  transit  for  a  couple  days,  but  you  can  work  on  this  because \n8  we  have  the  stipulation  on  record. \n9  But  I  will  issue  an  order  no  later  than  Monday  that \n10  memorializes  everything  that  we've  accomplished  today  in  the \n11  form  of  an  order  giving  20  days  from  today's  date,  requesting \n12  that  at  or  by  that  date  and  it can  be  sooner,  obviously.  If \n13  Mr .  Grenade  finds  a  place  in  New  York  and  has  met,  otherwise, \n14  the  conditions  that  ICE  has  established,  then  I  can  be  so \n15  notified,  obviously,  and  we  will  close  the  file  at  that  point \n16  by  separate  order . \n17  Alternatively,  it's my  understanding  that  based  on  the \n18  agreement  that  has  been  reached,  that  inasmuch  as  I  am \n19  retaining  jurisdicti on,  that  if -- for  example,  a  scenario may \n20  be  that  Mr.  Grenade  cannot  find  a  place  in  New  York  and  wishes \n21  to  revisit  this  on  the  merits,  that  is,  have  the  bond  hearing \n22  that  we ' re  not  going  to  have  today,  that  we ' ll reschedule  that \n23  forthwith  upon  notification  that  Mr .  Grenade  wishes  to  do  so. \n24  Is  that  your  understanding? \n25  MS.  ANELLO:  Yes,  Your  Honor . \n\n6 \n1  THE  COURT:  Your  understanding,  Mr .  Atkinson? \n2  MR.  ATKINSON:  Yes,  Your  Honor . \n3  THE  COURT:  All  right.  Anything  else  that  you  want  to \n4  put  on  the  record  today? \n5  MS .  ANELLO :  No,  Your  Honor . \n6  MR.  ATKINSON :  No,  Your  Honor. \n7  THE  COURT:  All  right .  And  I  commend  counsel .  I \n8  think  that  we  have  a  reasonable  framework  for  an  agreement . \n9  Mr.  Grenade,  is  this  agreeable  to  you? \n10  MR.  GRENADE:  Yes,  sir. \n11  THE  COURT:  Then  we 're  going  to  do  our  best  to  see  if \n12  this  can  be  implemented.  I  understand  you ' re  going  to  make \n13  every  effort  to  find  a  place  in  New  York .  If  we  need  to extend \n14  the  period,  if  you 're  making  progress  and  you  haven 't  quite \n15  completed  it within  the  20-day  period,  that ' s  all  right,  too . \n16  I ' m perfectly  willing  to  do  that. \n17  So  if we  get  towards  the  elapse  of  the  20-day  period \n18  and  you  want  to extend  the  period  for  some  reasonable  time, \n19  that ' s  perfectly  all right .  Just  tell me  that,  and  we  can  kick \n20  out  an  order  that  does  that  if you  find  the  20  days  is  not \n21  enough  time  and  you ' re  making  progress  but  you  haven ' t  quite \n22  achieved  all  the  benchmarks.

This class action habeas petition and complaint for declaratory relief \nis brought on behalf of lawful permanent residents who are being imprisoned for \nprolonged periods of time in Pennsylvania facilities without receiving the most \nbasic element of Due Process—a custody hearing to determine if their prolonged \ndetention is justified.   \n2. Petitioners and named plaintiffs Alexander Alli and Elliot Grenade \n(hereafter “Petitioners”) are longtime lawful pemanent residents of the United \nStates who are challenging efforts by the Department of Homeland Security \n(“DHS”) to remove them from the United States.  Both have substantial ties to this \ncountry, including children who are U.S. citizens.  And both have substantial \nchallenges to removal.   Yet, each has been subject to prolonged detention—in Mr. \nAlli’s case for nearly nine months, and in Mr. Grenade’s case, for more than one \nand a half years—without any hearing to determine whether such detention is \njustified.\n3. Petitioners are not alone.  On any given day—DHS detains more than \none thousand noncitizens in jails across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, \nparticularly in the Middle District of Pennsylvania.  Like Petitioners, many are \nlawful permanent residents who are detained for months, if not years, while the \nimmigration courts and federal courts resolve their cases.  Yet they never receive a \n-3-\n\ncustody hearing to determine whether their prolonged detention is even necessary.  \nIndeed, many choose to abandon their meritorious cases because they cannot \nendure the prospect of being locked up indefinitely.\n4. Petitioners bring this action on their own behalf, and on behalf of \nsimilarly-situated individuals, to obtain the custody hearing to which they are \nstatutorily and constitutionally entitled. As set forth below, the Immigration and \nNationality Act (“INA”) does not authorize prolonged, pre-final order detention of \nthe kind Petitioners are suffering.  Indeed, if it did, it would raise serious \nconstitutional problems.  The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that immigration \ndetention violates Due Process unless it is reasonably related to its purpose.  \nMoreover, where detention is prolonged, Due Process requires a “sufficiently \nstrong special justification” to outweigh the significant deprivation of liberty, as \nwell as strong procedural protections to ensure that an individual’s detention is \nactually serving legitimate governmental aims, see Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. \n678, 690-91 (2001).  At a minimum, these procedural protections include a hearing \nbefore an impartial adjudicator where the government bears the burden of \njustifying prolonged detention.  Yet the government has failed to provide the \nPetitioners, and the class they seek to represent, with any custody hearing that \nwould even approach what is constitutionally required.\n5. Instead, pursuant to its unlawful policy and practice, the government \n-4-\n\nhas imprisoned Petitioners, and the similarly-situated persons they seek to \nrepresent, for prolonged periods of six months or more—and, in the case of Mr. \nGrenade, over one and a half years—without affording them a hearing to determine \nwhether their prolonged detention is justified.  This policy and practice violates \nboth the INA and the Due Process Clause.  To remedy this ongoing violation, \nPetitioners bring this action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of \nthemselves and declaratory relief on behalf of a class of similarly-situated persons.  \nPetitioners do not seek an order granting their release, but merely a hearing where \nthe government bears the burden of demonstrating that their prolonged detention is \njustified.\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE\n6. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § \n1331 (federal question); 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-02 (declaratory relief); 28 U.S.C. § \n2241 (habeas corpus); 5 U.S.C. § 702 (Administrative Procedures Act);  28 U.S.C. \n§ 1651 (All Writs Act); the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution; and the \nSuspension Clause of U.S. Constitution.\n7. Venue is proper in the Middle District of Pennsylvania pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 1391(b) because a substantial part of the events giving rise to these claims \noccurred in this District.  In the alternative, venue is proper in the District pursuant \n-5-\n\nto 28 U.S.C. § 2241(d) because Petitioners and proposed class members are \ndetained at facilities within this District.  \nPARTIES\n8. Petitioner Alexander Alli is a citizen of Ghana and a longtime lawful \npermanent resident of the United States.  He has been detained for nearly nine \nmonths while litigating his removal case.

Petitioner Alexander Alli, a longtime lawful permanent resident, has \nbeen detained for nearly nine months while challenging the Government’s efforts \nto remove him to Ghana, a country he left nearly 20 years ago.  Moreover, as \nrecognized by an Immigration Judge (“IJ”), Mr. Alli faces an indeterminate period \nof future detention while his immediate relative visa petition is pending at U.S. \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (“USCIS”).  See In the Matter of Alli, A \n074-983-378, dated Jan. 29, 2009 (“IJ decision”), at 4, attached as Ex. A.\n26. Mr. Alli came to the United States in 1990 and adjusted to lawful \npermanent resident status in 1996.  See Notice to Appear, dated Feb. 29, 2008, and \n-9-\n\nAdditional Charges of Inadmissibility/Deportability, dated July 2, 2008, attached \nas Ex. B.  He and his wife Rachel, a U.S. citizen, have been together for over \ntwenty years and were married in the United States in 2006.  They have three \nchildren together, all of whom are U.S. citizens. Mr. Alli has been licensed as a \nreal estate broker and owns his own real estate business, Bambos Property \nCorporation, which employs 10 to 15 agents at any given time.  Mr. Alli is also a \ndevout Christian and belongs to two different congregations of the Redeemed \nChristian Church of God, where Mrs. Alli is an ordained Deaconess.  Declaration \nof Alexander Alli (“Alli Decl.”) ¶¶ 12-33.\n27. In June 2006, Mr. Alli was convicted for conspiracy to commit wire \nfraud, identity fraud, and access device fraud under 18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 1028, and \n1029, respectively, and was sentenced to two years of incarceration.  See Ex. B. \nMr. Alli self-surrendered in January 2007 and completed his sentence in August\n2008.  See Bond Order, dated Mar. 9, 2005, attached as Ex. C.  Mr. Alli has no \nother criminal history.  See Alli Decl. ¶ 6.\n28. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) took custody of \nMr. Alli upon completion of his sentence on August 29, 2008.  At that time, ICE \nserved Mr. Alli with a Notice of Custody Determination informing him that he was \nsubject to mandatory detention and therefore ineligible for a bond hearing.  He has \nremained in ICE custody since that time—a period of nearly nine months.  He is \n-10-\n\ncurrently being held at the York County Prison in York, Pennsylvania.\n29. In his removal proceedings, Mr. Alli is seeking an INA § 212(h) \nwaiver of inadmissibility for his convictions so that he may re-apply for lawful \npermanent resident status based on his marriage to his U.S. citizen wife. On \nJanuary 29, 2009, the IJ held that Mr. Alli was eligible to seek such relief.  See In \nthe Matter of Alli, Ex. A, at 1.  However, Mr. Alli will not receive a hearing on his \napplication until his wife’s pending Form I-130 immediate relative visa petition is \napproved by USCIS.  As the IJ specifically noted, “several months, and sometimes \nmore than a year, is required” to process such visa petitions and Mr. Alli is \ntherefore “looking at potential long-term mandatory detention.”  Id. at 4.\n30. During the entire length of his detention, Mr. Alli has received no \ncustody hearing to determine whether his imprisonment is justified.  Moreover, \nbecause the government asserts that he is subject to mandatory detention, see Ex. \nC, it maintains that it need never provide him with a custody hearing, regardless of \nhow long his detention extends.\n31. Mr. Alli is neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community.  He has \nno violent criminal history and shows genuine evidence of rehabilitation.  See Alli \nDecl. ¶¶ 6-11, 34-36.  He has a history of appearing for legal proceedings, having \nself-surrendered for his criminal sentence after having been released on bond.  See\nEx. C; Alli Decl. ¶ 6.  He has strong ties to family, church, and community and a \n-11-\n\ncolorable claim to relief that gives him a strong incentive to appear for his removal \nproceedings.  Moreover, he has agreed to submit to supervision during the \npendency of his case, including electronic monitoring if necessary.  See Alli Decl. \n¶¶ 34-36.\nElliot Grenade \n32. Petitioner Elliot Grenade, a longtime lawful permanent resident, has \nspent 20 months in detention while challenging the government’s efforts to remove \nhim to Trinidad and Tobago, a country he left nearly 28 years ago.  Moreover, over \neighteen months of that detention is attributable to the government’s failure to send \nMr. Grenade’s Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) briefing schedule to the \nproper address.\n33. Mr. Grenade entered the United States as a lawful permanent resident \non or about August 6, 1981 when he was 21 years old.  See Notice to Appear, \ndated Jan. 12, 2007, attached as Ex. D.  He has a domestic partner and two \nchildren—Starquasia (age 11) and Elijah (age nine), who are all U.S. citizens, as \nwell as an elderly mother who is a U.S. citizen.  He has no family ties outside the \nUnited States.  See Declaration of Elliot Grenade “Grenade Decl.”) ¶¶ 1, 6-9.\n34. On April 27, 1995, Mr. Grenade pled guilty to criminal sale of a \ncontrolled substance in the fifth degree, in violation of N.Y. Penal Law § 220.31.  \nAt that time, his sentence date was deferred so that he could enter a drug treatment \n-12-\n\nprogram. Mr. Grenade did not complete the program and on September 28, 2006\nhe was re-sentenced for the same offense to two to four years of jail time.  He \ncompleted serving his sentence on September 28, 2007.  See Grenade Decl. ¶ 4.\n35. While Mr. Grenade was still serving his sentence, DHS commenced \nremoval proceedings against him based on his drug offense.  Ex. E.  Litigating his \nremoval case pro se, Mr. Grenade applied for relief from removal under former \nINA § 212(c) based on, inter alia, his long residence in the United States and his \nstrong family ties.  Nevertheless, the IJ ordered his removal to Trindad and Tobago \non August 2, 2007.  See Grenade v. Holder, No. 07-4953-ag (2d Cir. Apr. 29, \n2009), at *2, attached as Ex. E.  Mr. Grenade, still representing himself pro se, \ntimely appealed the IJ’s decision to the BIA.\n36. On September 18, 2007, upon completion of his criminal sentence and \nwhile his BIA appeal was pending, Mr. Grenade was taken into ICE custody and \nserved with a Notice of Custody Determination indicating that he was subject to \nmandatory detention and therefore not eligible for a bond hearing.  See Notice of \nCustody Determination, dated Dec. 28, 2006, attached as Ex. F.  Since that time, \nMr. Grenade has remained in ICE custody—a period of 20 months.  He is currently \nbeing held at the Pike County Correctional Facility in Lords Valley, Pennsylvania.\n37. On October 15, 2007, the BIA summarily dismissed Mr. Grenade’s\nappeal, based, in part, on his failure to submit a timely brief.  See Grenade v. \n-13-\n\nHolder, Ex. E, at *2. With the assistance of newly appointed pro bono counsel, \nMr. Grenade appealed the BIA’s order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second \nCircuit based, inter alia, on the fact that the Board had sent the briefing schedule to \na non-existent address.  Id. at *3. Ultimately, in April 2009—more than a year and \na half after the BIA’s summary dismissal—the Second Circuit granted Mr. \nGrenade’s appeal and remanded his case to the Board for further proceedings.  See\nid. at 4.  \n38. On remand, Mr. Grenade will raise a number of colorable challenges \nto the IJ’s denial of INA § 212(c) relief.  These include the IJ’s failure to advise \nhim of the availability of free legal services at trial which therefore prejudiced him \nin his ability to build his case for relief, see 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10, and the IJ’s error \nin weighing the strong equities in his case, such as the significant hardship his \nremoval would cause his family, including his eighty-two year old mother, two \nchildren, and his domestic partner, all of whom are U.S. citizens; his 28 years of \nlegal residence in the United States; his ties to the community, including his work \nwith religious communities; and evidence of his rehabilitation.  See generally,\nGrenade Decl.\n39. To date, Mr. Grenade has received no hearing as to whether his \ndetention is justified.  Instead, the only process he has received consists of a \nnumber of perfunctory administrative custody reviews that, on information and \n-14-\n\nbelief, deemed him a danger and flight risk based on his criminal history alone.  \nSee Notice of File Custody Review, dated Dec. 3, 2007, attached as Ex. G; \nDecision to Continue Detention-Stay, dated Jan. 16, 2009, attached as Ex. H.\n40. Moreover, because the government maintains that Mr. Grenade is \nsubject to mandatory detention, see Ex. F, Mr. Grenade will receive no hearing \nregarding his imprisonment for as long as his removal proceedings remain \npending.  This is so regardless of how long it takes for the Board to decide his \nappeal or, should he win a remand, for the IJ to decide the merits of his claim for \nINA § 212(c) relief.     \n41. Mr. Grenade poses no danger or flight risk. If released, Mr. Grenade \nintends to join his mother and children in Danville, Virginia and help support his \nfamily.  He has no violent criminal history, strong family ties, and a colorable \nclaim to relief that gives him a strong incentive to appear for his removal \nproceedings.  Moreover, he has agreed to submit to supervision during the \npendency of his case, including electronic monitoring if necessary.  Grenade Decl. \n¶ 27.\nCLASSWIDE ALLEGATIONS\n42. Petitioners are among dozens of detainees in the State of \nPennsylvania—and the Middle District of Pennsylvania in particular—who have \nbeen held for six months or more without a hearing to determine whether their \n-15-\n\nprolonged detention is justified.  Indeed, it is the government’s policy or practice to \ndetain non-citizens for prolonged periods of time pending completion of their \nremoval proceedings without providing them with hearings to determine whether \nsuch detention is justified.\n43. Petitioners bring this action on behalf of themselves and all other \nsimilarly-situated persons in Pennsylvania pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2) or, in the alternative, as a representative habeas class \naction for similarly-situated persons in the Middle District of Pennsylvania \npursuant to a procedure analogous to Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(2).  See Ali v. Ashcroft, \n346 F.3d 873, 890-91 (9th Cir 2003), overruled on other grounds, Jama v. \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement, 543 U.S. 335 (2005) (allowing class \naction habeas petition); Bijeol v. Benson, 513 F.2d 965, 969 (7th Cir. 1975) (same); \nUnited States ex rel. Sero v. Preiser, 506 F.2d 1115, 1126-27 (2d Cir. 1974) \n(same).  See also Geraghty v. U.S. Parole Commission, 429 F. Supp. 737, 740 \n(M.D. Pa. 1977) (noting that “procedures analogous to a class action have been \nfashioned in habeas corpus actions where necessary and appropriate”).\n44. Petitioners propose to represent a class of all lawful permanent \nresidents in Pennsylvania or, in the alternative, within this District who (1) are or \nwill be detained for prolonged periods of six months or more under the pre-final-\norder detention statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1226, pending completion of their removal \n-16-\n\nproceedings, inclusive of judicial review where the removal order has been stayed; \n(2) have not been afforded a hearing to determine whether their prolonged \ndetention is justified; (3) are not detained pursuant to one of the detention statutes \nthat specifically authorizes prolonged detention in excess of six months on national \nsecurity grounds,  see 8 U.S.C. § 1226A; 8 U.S.C. §§ 1531-37 (authorizing \nprolonged detention of, inter alia, suspected terrorists); and (4) are not detained \npursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1225, the statute that governs pre-final-order detention of \nnoncitizens who have not yet been admitted to the United States.\n45. The proposed class meets the requirements of Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure 23(a)(1).  At any given time, Petitioners’ counsel have been aware of \nroughly 40 other potential class members in this District alone who, like \nPetitioners, have been detained for six months or more pending completion of \nremoval proceedings and have never been given a hearing to determine whether \ntheir prolonged detention is justified.  Declaration of Michael Tan ¶ 2.  Indeed, \nICE’s own length of stay report for January 25, 2009 suggests that, on that date, \ndozens and possibly more similarly-situated non-citizens in removal proceedings \nhad been detained in this District and in Pennsylvania as a whole for six months or \nlonger without a hearing.  Id. at ¶¶ 11-17.  In addition, other persons will be subject \nto the government’s detention policy or general practice in the future.  Joinder of \nall members of this class is therefore impracticable.\n-17-\n\n46. The proposed class meets the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23(a)(2).  There are several common questions of law and fact in this \naction.  These include: (1) whether the government has a policy or general practice \nof detaining non-citizens for six months or more pending completion of removal \nproceedings without providing a hearing to determine whether such detention is \njustified; (2) whether this detention policy or practice is authorized by statute; and \n(3) whether this detention policy or practice violates the Due Process Clause.\n47. The proposed class meets the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23(a)(3).  The claims of the named Petitioners are typical of the claims \nof the proposed class.  Like all the proposed class members, the named Petitioners \nare lawful permanent residents who have been detained, pursuant to the \ngovernment’s policy and practice, pending completion of removal proceedings, \ninclusive of judicial review where the removal order has been stayed, but have \nnever been afforded a hearing to determine whether their prolonged detention is \njustified.\n48. The proposed class meets the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23(a)(4).  The named Petitioners will fairly and adequately represent the \ninterests of all members of the proposed class because they seek relief identical to \nthe relief sought by all class members, and because they have no interests adverse \nto other class members.  Moreover, the named Petitioners are represented by pro \n-18-\n\nbono counsel from the ACLU Immigrants’ Rights Project, the ACLU of \nPennsylvania, and the law firm of Pepper Hamilton LLP.  The organizations and \nattorneys working for the named Petitioners have extensive experience litigating \non behalf of detained immigrants and litigating class actions.\n49. The proposed class meets the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23(b)(2).  Respondents have acted on grounds generally applicable to \nthe class through their policy and practice of detaining non-citizens for six months \nor longer pending completion of removal proceedings without providing them a \nhearing to determine whether such prolonged detention is justified, making \nclasswide declaratory relief appropriate.\nLEGAL BACKGROUND\n50. Petitioners request only one form of relief: a constitutionally adequate \nhearing to determine whether their prolonged detention is justified.  Petitioners \nargue here that: (1) the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) does not authorize \ntheir prolonged detention without such a hearing, and (2) if it does, their prolonged \ndetention without adequate review violates the Due Process Clause.\n51. In Demore v. Kim, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of \nmandatory, pre-final order detention only where the non-citizen had conceded \nremovability and was held for the “brief period necessary for [completing] removal \nproceedings.”  538 U.S. 510, 513 (2003) (emphasis added).  The Demore Court, \n-19-\n\nhowever, did not address the permissibility of detention where that detention is \nprolonged in nature, and especially in cases where, as here, the individuals being \ndetained are pursuing a colorable challenge to removal.\n52. As set forth below, the INA does not authorize prolonged, pre-final \norder detention of the kind Petitioners have suffered and, indeed, would raise \nserious constitutional problems if it did.  The Supreme Court has repeatedly held \nthat immigration detention violates due process unless it is reasonably related to its \npurpose.  Moreover, where detention is prolonged, due process requires a \n“sufficiently strong special justification” to outweigh the significant deprivation of \nliberty, as well as strong procedural protections to ensure that an individual’s \ndetention is actually serving those governmental aims.  See Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 \nU.S. 678, 690-91 (2001).  Yet the government has failed to provide review that \neven approaches constitutional minimums.\n53. This Court need not—and should not—decide the serious \nconstitutional questions raised by Petitioners’ prolonged, pre-final order detention.  \nPrinciples of statutory construction require that, where possible, courts should \nconstrue statutes so as to avoid serious constitutional problems.  Indeed, the \nSupreme Court applied this canon in Zadvydas, construing the post-final-order \ndetention statute as authorizing detention only for the period of time reasonably \nnecessary to effectuate removal, and designating six months as the presumptively \n-20-\n\nreasonable period, even though the statute itself placed no limit on the length of \ndetention.  See id. at 701.  Likewise here, the pre-final-order statute is silent with \nrespect to both the length of detention authorized and the procedures necessary to \nimpose such detention.  In the absence of any evidence that Congress intended to \nauthorize prolonged detention without a constitutionally adequate hearing, this \nCourt should construe the statute as authorizing prolonged, pre-final order \ndetention only when accompanied by adequate procedural safeguards.  Thus, on \nstatutory grounds alone, this Court should order the government to provide \nPetitioners and the class they seek to represent with a constitutionally adequate \ncustody hearing.  \nI. The INA Does Not Authorize Petitioners’ Prolonged Detention \nWithout Constitutionally Adequate Procedural Protections.\n54. The rule of constitutional avoidance requires construing the pre-final \norder detention statute not to authorize Petitioners’ prolonged detention in the \nabsence of an adequate bond hearing.  The avoidance canon dictates reading a \nstatute as not authorizing unconstitutional action unless no other construction is \neven “fairly possible.” Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 689; see also Crowell v. Benson, 285 \nU.S. 22, 62 (1932).  This canon “is a tool for choosing between competing \nplausible interpretations of a statutory text, resting on the reasonable presumption \nthat Congress did not intend the alternative which raises serious constitutional \ndoubts.” Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 381 (2005); see also Sandoval v. Reno,\n-21-\n\n166 F.3d 225, 237 (3d Cir. 1999).\n55. The Supreme Court has consistently applied the canon of \nconstitutional avoidance to immigration statutes.  Thus, in Zadvydas, the Court \nheld that the general detention statute governing post-final order detention, 8 \nU.S.C. § 1231(a)(6), is insufficiently clear to authorize prolonged and indefinite \ndetention.  Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 697 (“if Congress had meant to authorize long-\nterm detention of unremovable aliens, it certainly could have spoken in clearer \nterms”); see also id. at 689, 699.  \n56. Applying the same rule here, the pre-final order detention statute \nshould be construed as not authorizing prolonged detention without a \nconstitutionally adequate hearing so long as another construction is “fairly \npossible.” See id. at 689.\nA. The Pre-Final Order Detention Statute Does Not \nExpressly Authorize Prolonged Detention.\n57. Petitioners and the detainees they seek to represent are detained under \n8 U.S.C. § 1226, the statute that governs the pre-final order detention of most non-\ncitizens who have been admitted to the United States and whom the government is \ntrying to remove.  8 U.S.C. § 1226(a) authorizes discretionary detention of such \nnon-citizens “pending a decision” as to removal, except for certain non-citizens \nremovable on criminal or terrorism-related grounds who are subject to mandatory \npre-final order detention under 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c).  \n-22-\n\n58. None of the Petitioners nor any other person they seek to represent are \ndetained pursuant to one of the detention statutes that specifically authorizes \nprolonged detention on national security grounds.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1226a; 8 U.S.C. \n§§ 1531-37 (authorizing prolonged detention of, inter alia, suspected terrorists).\n59. Nothing in the plain language of § 1226 states that it authorizes\nprolonged detention.  Nor is there any other evidence that Congress intended to \nauthorize prolonged detention.  \n60. Indeed, in upholding the constitutionality of § 1226(c), the Supreme \nCourt specifically described that statute as authorizing mandatory detention only \n“during the brief period necessary for . . . removal proceedings,” Demore, 538 U.S. \nat 513—a period that typically “lasts roughly a month and a half in the vast \nmajority of cases . . . and about five months in the minority of cases in which the \nalien chooses to appeal [to the BIA].”  Id. at 530; see also Madrane v. Hogan, 520 \nF. Supp. 2d 654, 664 (M.D. Pa. 2007) (noting that “[t]he emphasis in Demore on \nthe anticipated limited duration of the detention period is unmistakable, and the \nCourt explicitly anchored its holding by noting a brief period.”) (internal citations \nomitted).  Cf. Nadarajah v. Gonzales, 443 F.3d 1069, 1079 (9th Cir. 2006) \n(holding that where Congress intended to authorize prolonged and indefinite \ndetention, i.e., in cases involving specific types of national security risks, it did so \nclearly and that “general detention statutes” authorize detention only for “brief and \n-23-\n\nreasonable” time periods).\n61. The existence of distinct statutory provisions—namely, 8 U.S.C. § \n1537(b)(1), 1226A(a)(2)—that do expressly authorize the prolonged detention of \nterrorists further demonstrates that Congress did not intend for a general detention \nstatute such as § 1226 to serve this purpose.  Notably, the Supreme Court \nspecifically referenced these provisions in concluding that statutes that do not \nexpressly authorize prolonged and indefinite detention should not be read to do so.  \nSee Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 697; Martinez, 543 U.S. at 379 n.4, 386.  Unlike § 1226, \nthese special statutes clearly address the question of how long a non-citizen subject \nto their provisions may be detained: “until the completion of any appeal” in the \ncase of the Alien Terrorist Removal provisions, 8 U.S.C. § 1537(b)(1), and “until \nthe alien is removed from the United States” in the case of the Patriot Act.  8 \nU.S.C. § 1226A(a)(2).\nB. Prolonged Detention Without Adequate Procedural \nSafeguards Raises Serious Constitutional Concerns.\n62. The Supreme Court has held that due process requires a “sufficiently \nstrong special justification” to “outweigh[]” detention’s significant deprivation of \nliberty, as well as strong procedural protections.  See Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 690-\n91.  As detention becomes prolonged, the deprivation of liberty becomes greater, \nrequiring an even stronger justification and more rigorous procedural protections.  \nSee Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346, 368 (1997) (upholding involuntary civil \n-24-\n\ncommitment for periods of one year at a time, subject to “strict procedural \nsafeguards” including right to jury trial before state court and imposition of burden \nof proof beyond a reasonable doubt on the government).  \n63. Similarly, the Third Circuit has emphasized, even with respect to \n“excludable” non-citizens, that “when detention is prolonged, special care must be \nexercised . . . . The stakes are high and we emphasize that grudging and \nperfunctory review is not enough to satisfy the due process right to liberty . . . .”  \nNgo v. INS, 192 F.3d 390, 398 (3d Cir. 1999).\n64. Notably, unlike the Petitioners here and the class they seek to \nrepresent, Zadvydas and Ngo involved individuals who had been finally ordered \nremoved—i.e., who had exhausted all administrative and judicial challenges to \nremoval and whose removal order could have been effectuated if a country had \nbeen willing to take them back.  In contrast, individuals like Petitioners and \nproposed class members are pursuing colorable challenges to removal on which \nthey may well prevail.\n65. In addition, Ngo involved an “excludable alien.”  As the Third Circuit \nhas recognized, “excludable aliens traditionally have been afforded less \nconstitutional protection than deportable [i.e., admitted] aliens.” Patel, 275 F. 3d at \n310.  Non-citizens who have been admitted to the country, moreover as lawful \npermanent residents, hold even greater due process rights, see Zadvydas, 533 U.S. \n-25-\n\nat 693; see also Landon v. Plasencia, 459 U.S. 21, 32-33 (1982), and thus even \ngreater care must be exercised with respect to their prolonged confinement.\n66. As previously noted, in Demore, the Supreme Court upheld pre-final \norder mandatory detention for the brief period of time necessary to complete \nremoval proceedings.  Since Demore, the circuit courts considering the issue have \nacknowledged the serious constitutional concerns raised by prolonged, pre-final \norder detention.  See Tijani v. Willis, 430 F.3d 1241, 1242 (9th Cir. 2005) (finding \nthat petitioner’s prolonged mandatory detention while pursuing administrative and \njudicial review of his removal order raised serious constitutional problems and \nconstruing statute to require IJ bond hearing where Government bore burden of \njustifying imprisonment); Casas-Castrillon v. Dep’t of Homeland Security, 535 \nF.3d 942, 948 (9th Cir. 2008) (finding that “mandatory, bureaucratic detention of \naliens under § 1226(c) was intended to apply for only a limited time”); Ly v. \nHansen, 351 F.3d 263, 271-72 (6th Cir. 2003) (construing pre-final-order detention \nstatute, § 1226, as authorizing detention only for “a time reasonably required to \ncomplete removal proceedings in a timely manner,” and finding prolonged \ndetention to be  “especially unreasonable” where no chance of actual removal \nexisted); Cf. Demore, 538 U.S. at 532-33 (Kennedy, J. concurring) (noting that, at \nsome point, prolonged mandatory detention is not reasonably related to removal); \nTijani, 430 F. 3d at 1249 (Tashima, J., concurring) (noting that the “sheer length” \n-26-\n\nof petitioner’s detention violates the Constitution).  See also Welch v. Ashcroft, 293 \nF.3d 213, 224 (4th Cir. 2002) (holding, pre-Demore, prolonged detention of “a \nlongtime resident alien with extensive community ties, with no chance of release \nand no speedy adjudication rights” to be impermissible); Hussain v. Mukasey, 510 \nF.3d 739, 743 (7th Cir. 2007) (acknowledging that “[i]nordinate delay before [a \nremoval] order was entered might well justify relief” from mandatory detention but \ndeclining to decide the issue on mootness grounds).\n67. Several judges within the Middle District of Pennsylvania have \nrecently held the same.  See, e.g., Madrane, 520 F. Supp. at 666 (expressing \n“concern over what appears to be an extraordinarily lengthy deprivation of liberty”\nunder § 1226(c)); Nunez-Pimentel v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Security, No. 07-\n1915, 2008 WL 2593806 (M.D. Pa. June 27, 2008) (same); Victor v. Mukasey, No. \n08-1914, 2008 WL 5061810, at *3 (M.D. Pa. Nov. 25, 2008) (same); Wilks v. U.S. \nDep’t Homeland Security, No. 07-2171, 2008 WL 4820654, at *2 (M.D. Pa. Nov. \n3, 2008) (construing § 1226(c) to not authorize mandatory detention “beyond the\nperiod typically required for removal proceedings”).  \n68. Thus, even if § 1226(c) was properly applied to Petitioners at the \nbeginning of their detention, it does not authorize their mandatory detention now.  \nThe excessive length of Petitioners’ detention—which has reached beyond the \naverage five-month period recognized by the Supreme Court in Demore for cases \n-27-\n\ninvolving administrative appeals, 538 U.S. at 530—is patently unreasonable, at \nleast in the absence of a constitutionally adequate custody hearing.\n69. Indeed, the unreasonableness of Petitioners’ detention is further \ndemonstrated not only by the length of detention they have already endured, but \nalso by the indeterminate, potentially lengthy, future detention they face.  See, e.g., \nLy, 351 F.3d at 271-72; Tijani, 430 F.3d at 1242.  \n70. For example, if Mr. Grenade prevails on his appeal at the BIA, his \ncase will be remanded back to the IJ for further proceedings, which itself could \ntake a significant amount of time.  Mr. Alli will not even have his individualized \nmerits hearing on his adjustment claim before the IJ until his immediate relative \nvisa petition is approved.  See, e.g., Ly, 351 F.3d at 265 (noting that the petitioner’s \ncase was pending before the IJ for more than 18 months, most of this time waiting\nfor a merits hearing and a decision); Madrane, 520 F. Supp. 2d at 667 (expressing \nconcern that “the administrative and appellate process that has yet to be exhausted \nmay be considerably time-consuming”); Nunez-Pimentel, 2008 WL 2592806 at *5 \n(same); Victor, 2008 WL 5061810, at *4-5 (same).  \n71. Likewise, if Messrs. Alli or Grenade were to lose before the IJ or the \nBIA, they would almost certainly seek further review from the Court of Appeals.  \nThere is thus simply no way to predict how long it will take before Petitioners’ \nremoval challenges will finally be resolved.  Such resolution could take months or \n-28-\n\neven years, during which time Petitioners will be needlessly forced to endure \nfurther detention.\nC. The Pre-Final Order Detention Statute Should Be \nConstrued as Requiring a Constitutionally Adequate Bond \nHearing Whenever Detention Extends Six Months or \nBeyond.\n72. Once mandatory detention exceeds the brief period of time \ncontemplated by Demore, the only authority for continuing such detention is § \n1226(a).  See 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a) (generally providing for discretionary detention \nof arrested non-citizens “[e]xcept as provided in subsection (c) of this section”); cf.\nCasas-Castrillon, 535 F.3d at 948-49 (holding that § 1226(c) provides no authority \nfor mandatory detention of individuals beyond the brief period contemplated in \nDemore and that § 1226(a) therefore applies).  \n73. In order to address the serious due process concerns raised by \nprolonged, pre-final order detention without adequate review, and in the absence of\nany evidence that Congress intended to authorize such detention, this Court should \nconstrue § 1226(a) to require a bond hearing whenever detention has extended to \nsix months or longer.  Moreover, in order for that hearing to be constitutionally \nadequate, the government should bear the burden of proof of showing a sufficiently \nstrong justification to outweigh the deprivation of liberty caused by continued \ndetention.\n-29-\n\n74. In the civil detention context, the Supreme Court has repeatedly \nemphasized the importance of placing the burden of proof on the government to \njustify continued detention.  See, e.g., Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 692 (criticizing the \nregulations governing prolonged immigration detention for placing the burden of \nproof on the non-citizen); Tijani, 430 F.3d at 1242, 1244-45 (Tashima, J. \nconcurring) (noting that when the right to individual liberty is at stake, Supreme \nCourt precedent rejects laws that place on the individual the burden of protecting \nthat right); Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U.S. 71, 81 (1992) (striking civil commitment \nstatute because individual was denied an ‘‘adversary hearing at which the State \nmust prove by clear and convincing evidence that he is demonstrably dangerous to \nthe community’’); United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 750 (1987) (upholding \npre-trial detention under Bail Reform Act where Act provided for “a full-blown \nadversary hearing, the Government must convince a neutral decision-maker by \nclear and convincing evidence that no conditions of release can reasonably assure \nthe safety of the community or any person”); Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, \n432-33 (1979) (holding that state must justify civil commitment by clear and \nconvincing evidence of mental illness and dangerousness and rejecting \npreponderance standard); Hendricks, 521 U.S. at 353 (noting that state statute \nproviding for civil detention of “sexually violent predators” required prosecutor to \nprove beyond a reasonable doubt whether detention was justified during a trial at \n-30-\n\nwhich the individual had the right to counsel and right to present evidence and \ncross-examine witnesses).\n75. In recognition of these concerns, both the Ninth Circuit and this Court \nhave construed § 1226 to require a bond hearing where the Government bears the \nburden of demonstrating that prolonged detention is justified.  See Casas-\nCastrillon, 535 F.3d at 950 (construing § 1226(a) as requiring such a hearing); \nTijani, 430 F.3d at 1242 (finding that mandatory detention does not apply when \nproceedings are not “expeditious,” and ordering the petitioner’s release unless the \nGovernment established at a hearing before an IJ that his prolonged detention was \njustified); Wilks, 2008 WL 4820654 at *2 (same).  Thus, this Court should likewise \nconstrue § 1226(a) to require a constitutionally adequate custody hearing where, as \nhere, detention has become prolonged in nature.\n76. Detention should be deemed “prolonged” in nature whenever it \nextends six months or longer.  See Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 701; Demore, 538 U.S. at \n513; Nadarajah, 443 F.3d at 1079.  \n77. Moreover, as set forth above, the reasonableness of detention is \ndefined by both the length of detention to date and length of future detention.  See \nsupra.  Consequently, the government must be required to justify continued \ndetention in light of both the length of past detention and the prospective length of \ndetention in the future.\n-31-\n\nII. The Due Process Clause Requires that Petitioners Be Afforded a \nHearing as to Whether Their Prolonged Detention is Justified.\n78. Assuming arguendo that the INA did authorize Petitioners’ prolonged \ndetention without a constitutionally adequate hearing, such detention would violate\nthe Due Process Clause.  As the Supreme Court has recognized, “[f]reedom from \nimprisonment—from Government custody, detention, or other forms of physical \nrestraint—lies at the heart of the liberty that [the Due Process] Clause protects.”  \nZadvydas, 533 U.S. at 690.  Moreover, as previously set forth, non-citizens—even \nthose, who unlike Petitioners have exhausted all their challenges to removal and \nare simply waiting to be removed—have a liberty interest threatened by \nimmigration detention.  Id. at 690-91; see also Patel v. Zemski, 275 F.3d 299, 309 \n(3d Cir. 2001), overruled on other grounds, Demore v. Kim, 538 U.S. 510 (2003) \n(recognizing “the critical liberty interest implicated by immigration detention”).  \n79. For this reason, the Supreme Court has held that detention violates \ndue process without a “sufficiently strong special justification” to “outweigh[]” the \nsignificant deprivation of liberty.  Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 690-91; see also Ngo, 192 \nF.3d at 398.\n80. Moreover, due process requires “strong procedural protections” to \nensure that detention is justified.  See Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 690-91; see also Ngo, \n162 F.3d at 398.  As the Supreme Court has held, to be constitutionally adequate, \nsuch review must allocate the burden of proof to the government to demonstrate a \n-32-\n\nsufficiently strong special justification for continued detention.  See supra. ¶ 73.\nBecause Petitioners in this case and the class they seek to represent have not \nreceived any hearing regarding their prolonged detention, much less review that \neven approaches these constitutional minimums, their continued detention violates \nthe Due Process Clause.\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF\nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION\nVIOLATION OF IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT—\nPROLONGED DETENTION IN THE ABSENCE OF A HEARING WHERE \nTHE GOVERNMENT BEARS THE BURDEN OF SHOWING THAT SUCH \nPROLONGED DETENTION IS JUSTIFIED\n81. The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated herein.\n82. 8 U.S.C. § 1226—the provision of the Immigration and Nationality \nAct (INA) under which Petitioners and other proposed class members are \ndetained—is silent with regard to the procedures required if such detention \nbecomes prolonged.  Because of the serious constitutional problems that would be \nposed if the statute authorized prolonged detention without the kind of strong \njustification and procedural safeguards that such detention would require—and in \nthe absence of any indication that Congress intended this result—this Court must \nconstrue the statute as requiring a constitutionally adequate hearing where the \ngovernment bears the burden of showing that prolonged detention is justified.\n83. Because Petitioners and other proposed class members have been \n-33-\n\ndetained for a prolonged period of time without a constitutionally adequate custody \nhearing, their detention violates the INA.\nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION\nVIOLATION OF IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT AND THE \nADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT—PROLONGED DETENTION IN \nTHE ABSENCE OF A HEARING WHERE THE GOVERNMENT BEARS \nTHE BURDEN OF SHOWING THAT SUCH PROLONGED DETENTION IS \nJUSTIFIED\n84. The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated herein.\n85. Pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. § 702, “A \nperson suffering legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or \naggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute, is entitled to \njudicial review thereof.”\n86. Petitioners and the members of the proposed class have been so \naggrieved.\n87. 8 U.S.C. § 1226—the provision of the Immigration and Nationality \nAct (INA) under which Petitioners and other proposed class members are \ndetained—is silent with regard to the procedures required if such detention \nbecomes prolonged. Because of the serious constitutional problems that would be \nposed if the statute authorized prolonged detention without the kind of strong \njustification and procedural safeguards that such detention would require—and in \nthe absence of any indication that Congress intended this result—this Court must \nconstrue the statute as requiring a constitutionally adequate hearing where the \n-34-\n\ngovernment bears the burden of showing that prolonged detention is justified.\n88. Because Petitioners and other proposed class members have been \ndetained for a prolonged period of time without a constitutionally adequate custody \nhearing, their detention violates the INA and the Administrative Procedures Act.\nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION\nVIOLATION OF DUE PROCESS CLAUSE OF THE FIFTH \nAMENDMENT—PROLONGED DETENTION WITHOUT A \nCONSTITUTIONALLY ADEQUATE HEARING WHERE THE \nGOVERNMENT BEARS THE BURDEN OF SHOWING THAT SUCH \nDETENTION IS JUSTIFIED\n89. The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated herein.\n90. Prolonged detention violates Due Process unless it is accompanied by \nstrong procedural protections to protect against the erroneous deprivation of \nliberty.  Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 690-91; Ngo, 192 F.3d at 398.  Moreover, when the \ngovernment deprives an individual of a significant liberty interest, the burden of \njustifying such a deprivation should be placed on the government.  See Tijani, 430 \nF.3d at 1242; Casas-Castrillon, 535 F.3d at 950.  \n91. During their detention, Petitioners and other proposed class members \nhave never had a custody hearing where the government bore the burden of \ndemonstrating that their prolonged detention is justified.\n92. Petitioners’ and other proposed class members’ prolonged detention \nhas not been accompanied by the kind of procedural protections that such a \nsignificant deprivation of liberty requires.  \n-35-\n\n93.
