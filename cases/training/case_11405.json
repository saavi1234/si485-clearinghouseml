    "summary": "<p>On September 6, 2001 displaced public housing residents represented by Florida Legal Services Inc., the Florida Justice Institute, and the National Housing Law Project filed a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida alleging that a revitalization plan for their complexes in Liberty City, Miami, Florida was racially discriminatory. The plaintiffs' claimed violations of the Fair Housing Act (42 U. S. C. §§ 3601 et seq.), Title VI of Civil Rights Acts of 1964 (42 U.S.C. §2000d),  Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection, the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act (QHWRA) ( 42 U.S. C. §1437v) and the Housing and Community Development Act (42 U.S.C. § 5304). The complaint was directed at two sets of defendants - Miami-Dade County / the Miami-Dade County Housing Agency (MDHA) and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief.</p><p>The thrust of plaintiffs' complaint was that the defendants' configuration of the Liberty City HOPE VI project was consciously designed to discourage African-Americans from living in the redeveloped Scott Homes neighborhood, and that the county's revitalization plan, as approved by HUD, would result in the destruction of affordable housing and the forced displacement of residents.</p><p>On July 3, 2002, the District Court (Judge Shelby Highsmith) certified a class consisting of all current African-American residents in the Scott-Holmes Housing Projects but denied (for lack of standing) certification of a class consisting of persons on the waiting list and applicants who would eventually be placed on the MDHA waiting list.</p><p>On November 11, 2009, United States District Court (Judge Daniel T. K. Hurley) granted defendants' motion for summary judgment and denied plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment.  On November 19, 2009, the court ordered final summary judgment against the plaintiffs, closing the case and terminating any pending motions as moot.</p><p></p>",

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n1.  Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and classes consisting of all African-American \nresidents of the James E. Scott Homes public housing development and all African-American \nindividuals on the waiting list for Miami-Dade County public housing, challenge the defendants \nMiami-Dade County and  the director of its Housing Agency, the United States Department of \nHousing and Urban Development (HUD) and its Secretary with respect to their planning, and \nimplementation of a multi-million dollar HOPE VI grant from HUD to Miami-Dade County. The \nHOPE VI plan will involuntary displace hundreds of African-American families currently \nresiding in James E. Scott Homes public housing development (hereafter Scott Homes).  This \n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 1    Entered on FLSD Docket 09/06/2001   Page 2 of 42\ndisplacement process is imminent. The HOPE VI Grant will then result in the demolition of \nresidents' homes, the seven hundred and fifty four  units of the Scott Homes pub! ic housing \nproject as well as the ninety tive  units in the adjoining Carver Homes public housing project. \nThe HOPE VI Grant will finance  replacement housing that will be, by design, inaccessible and \nunaffordable to the current residents and families on the waiting list for public housing. \n2.  Plaintiffs oppose the HOPE VI Grant project as currently configured. This project has \nbeen consciously designed for the purpose of discouraging African-Americans from living in the \nScott Homes neighborhood and will result: (1) in the destruction of desperately needed \naffordable housing for very poor families in the Scott Homes community, who are \noverwhelmingly African-American; (2) in the forced displacement of the predominantly African \nAmerican residents of the Scott Homes community; (3) in a dramatic reduction in the amount of \nthe affordable housing available for the displaced African-American residents of Scott Homes; \n(4) a significant reduction in the amount ofhousing affordable to poor residents of Miami-Dade \nCounty, who are predominantly African-American and (5) a dramatic  reduction in the amount of \nhousing affordable and available to large families who will be among those most severely \naffected by the project.  These families will not only be effectively excluded from the new Scott \nHomes community but will also tind little or no alternative housing in the larger Miami-Dade \narea. \n3.  Despite the mandates of federal law, plaintiffs and the classes they represent, their fellow \ntenants and waiting list families, have been effectively excluded from any opportunity to \nparticipate meaningfully in the planning of this \"'revitalized'' community. The defendants  have \ndeveloped plans that ensure that plaintiffs, and the other families currently living in Scott Homes \n2 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 1    Entered on FLSD Docket 09/06/2001   Page 3 of 42\nor eligible to live in the development. will be expelled from their homes and effectively barred \nfrom living in the newly revitalized community. \n4.  Plaintiffs seek through this action declaratory and injunctive relief as to all defendants to \nhalt the further implementation of the HOPE VI plan, including but not limited to, the forced or \nvoluntary relocation of the current residents, until the defendants have fully complied with the \nHOPE VI statute and guidelines. Title VI ofthe Civil Rights Act of 1964,42 U.S.C.§ 2000d, et \n~the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3601, et seq. and the other statutes alleged herein. \nSpecifically, plaintiffs request this Court to order defendants to halt all relocation or demolition \nactivities related to the Scott Homes Housing project, and to fully maintain and operate Scott \nHomes as decent, safe and sound affordable public housing and to present to the Court a \nRevitalization Plan, including a Relocation Plan, Community and Supportive Services Plan and \nreplacement housing plan, that meets the requirements of the fair housing statutes and \nregulations, the Uniform Relocation Act, the Community Development Block Grant relocation \nand replacement housing requirements as set forth in the Housing and Community Development \nAct and implementing regulations, the National Environmental Policy Act and implementing \nregulations. \nII.

DEFENDANTS \n15.  Miami-Dade County  is a political subdivision of the State of Florida which owns and \noperates federally subsidized public housing projects including Scott Homes and Carver Homes. \nThe County  is a Public Housing Agency (\"PHA\") within the meaning of42 U.S.C. ~ 1437 and \nadministers the federally subsidized and assisted public  housing within its jurisdiction as \nauthorized by the United States Housing Act and implementing federal regulations.  Miami-Dade \nCounty is the recipient of a HOPE VI Grant from the federal defendants which will result in the \ndemolition of Scott Homes and is the agency  responsible for the implementation of the grant. \nMiami-Dade Housing Agency is the department within Miami-Dade County directly responsible \nfor the administration and operation of the County's  public housing, including the \nadministration and operation of the HOPE VI Grant. \n16.  Rene Rodriguez is the Director of the  Miami-Dade Housing Agency.  He is charged with \nestablishing and administering the policies of the Agency including those relating to the daily \noperation, administration and maintenance of all public housing and the administration of the \nHOPE VI Grant.

Defendant Martinez is sued herein in \nhis official capacity.  County defendants and federal defendants will collectively be referred to \nherein as \"defendants.\" \nIV.  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n20.  Plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalf and on behalf of all those similarly situated \npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and 23(b)(l ), (b)(2).  Plaintiffs seek to represent two classes \ndefined as the following: \nI.  All African-American individuals  residing in Scott Homes Public Housing \nProject as of September 17, 1999; and \n2.  All African-American families who currently are, or will in the future be, on the \nMiami-Dade Housing Agency public housing waiting list. \nPlaintiffs Reese and Bailey seek to represent the class of all African-American individuals \nresiding in Scott Homes Public Housing Project as of September 17, 1999.  Plaintiffs Herbert \nand Sanders seek to represent the class of all African American families who currently are, or \nwill in the future be, on the Miami-Dade Housing Agency public housing waiting list. \n21.  Each of the requirements of the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) is met.  Members \nof the classes are so numerous that joinder is impracticable and individual litigation by each \n7 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 1    Entered on FLSD Docket 09/06/2001   Page 8 of 42\nwould unnecessarily and substantially burden the operation of the judicial system. \n21.  The interest of the classes members are typified by the interest ofthe named plaintiffs. all \nof whom share a common right to relief and a common interest in the case.  The named plaintiffs \nwill adequately and fairly represent and protect the interests of the classes in that each named \nplaintiff has suffered the same or similar harm in tem1s of deprivation of rights to fair housing \nand/or relocation benefits under federal housing and fair housing  law and the United States \nConstitution.  The attorneys representing plaintiffs and the legal services organizations which \nemploy them, Florida Legal Services, Inc. and Florida Justice Institute. Inc.  are experienced and \ncapable litigators possessed of sufficient resources to adequately protect and represent the \ninterests of the plaintiff classes. \n23.  The defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable to each plaintiff and to the \nclasses the plaintiffs represent, thereby making appropriate injunctive relief with respect to the \nclasses as a whole.  Specifically, defendants have utilized the policies and practices described \nherein to deny plaintiffs and the members of the plaintiff classes their rights under federal law \nand the United States Constitution. \n24.  Questions of law and fact common to the members of the putative classes predominate \nover questions affecting only individual members, and a class action is superior to individual \nlawsuits for resolving this controversy. \n25.  The questions of fact common to all members of the classes are as follows: \na.  Whether the defendants' actions with respect to the HOPE VI plan will have a \ndisproportionate adverse impact on the members of the classes on the basis of race and on \nthe basis of familial status; \n8 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 1    Entered on FLSD Docket 09/06/2001   Page 9 of 42\nb.  Whether the defendants' actions targeted  the Scott Homes public housing \ndevelopment for demolition and redevelopment because of the racial composition of its \nresidents and have expressed a racial preference in their public presentations and written \nmaterials: \nc.  Whether the federal defendants failed to consider the racial and socio-economic \neffects of the County defendants' application for a HOPE VI grant and funded the County \nHOPE VI application de~pite the fact that it contained an express racial preference; \nd.  Whether the County defendants failed to consider the racial and socio-economic \neffects of their HOPE VI plan; \ne.  Whether the County defendants are failing to provide within the same community \ncomparable replacement dwellings for the same number of occupants as those units \ndemolished; \nf.  Whether the defendants are proceeding with relocation despite not having \ndeveloped  a relocation plan that conforms to the requirements of the Uniform Relocation \nAct and the implementing regulations and in the absence of an adequate residential anti \ndisplacement and relocation assistance plan: \n. g.  Whether County defendants are proceeding without having conducted any \nenvironmental assessment ofthe impact of the HOPE VI grant. \n26.  The questions of law common to all members of the classes are as follows: \na.  Whether the County defendants' actions with respect to the HOPE VI \nredevelopment plan violate the class members' rights guaranteed under the Equal \n9 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 1    Entered on FLSD Docket 09/06/2001   Page 10 of 42\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution:  Title \n* \nVlli ofthe Civil Rights Act of 1968,42 U.S.C.  3604(a), (b), and (c): Title VI ofthe \nCivil Rights Act of 1964.42 U.S.C. 9 2000d: the Quality Housing and Work \nResponsibility Act of 1998.42 U.S.C. §§  1437c-l. 1437v: the Housing and Community \nDevelopment Act, 42 U.S.C.  § 5304(d): the Uniform Relocation Assistance And Real \nProperty Acquisition Act of 1970, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 4601, et seq.: and the \nNational Environmental Policy Act  (NEPA), 42 U.S.C.§ 4321 et seq.: and 42 U.S.C. § \n1983; \nb.  Whether the federal defendants' actions with respect to the HOPE VI \nredevelopment plan and application violate the class members rights guaranteed pursuant \nto the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution: Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of \n1968, 42 U.S.C. § 3608(e)(5), and 5 U.S.C. §§ 701 et seq. \nV. STATUTORY AND REGULA TORY SCHEME \nA. The HOPE VI Requirements \n27.  In October 1992, Congress created the Urban Revitalization Demonstration Program \n(\"URD\"), otherwise known as HOPE VL which provides grants of up to $50 million \"to carry \nout an urban revitalization demonstration program involving major reconstruction of severely \ndistressed or obsolete public housing projects to be administered by public housing agencies ... \" \nPub. L. 102-389, Title IL 106 Stat. 1579, reprinted at 42 U.S.C. § 14371, note. \n28.  In 1998 the HOPE VI Program was codified at42 U.S.C. § 1437v and provides. in \n10 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 1    Entered on FLSD Docket 09/06/2001   Page 11 of 42\nrelevant part, that a major purpose of the program is: \n( 1) improving the living environment for public housing residents of severely  distressed \npublic housing projects through the  demolition, rehabilitation, reconfiguration, or \nreplacement of obsolete public housing projects (or portions thereof); \n29.  HUD has issued interpretive policies requiring public housing agencies that receive \nHOPE VI funds to involve all affected tenants in the redevelopment process: \nResidents are to be included in all phases of the application pn:paration, planning, \nimplementation and operation ofthe HOPE VI development ... lPublic Housing \nAuthorities or \"PHAs\"] are responsible for communicating and disseminating \ninformation to all affected residents and ensuring that all affected residents have \nopportunities to participate .... Resident involvement often starts with the duly \nelected resident council, but the PHA must make sure that the resident council is \ntruly representative.  PHAs must give all affected residents reasonable notice of \nmeetings about HOPE VI planning and implementation, and provide them with \nopportunities to provide input.  Such meetings should be open to all affected \nresidents and their representatives. \nHUD's FY 1998 HOPE Vl Guidebook at 1. \n30.  The HOPE VI Grant application is accompanied by a very general, proposed \nRevitalization Plan,  describing the community to be developed.  After approval of the HOPE VI \nGrant application by federal defendants, the Grantee Housing Authority  and federal defendants \nenter into a Grant Agreement which requires  that a specific revitalization plan must be  approved \nby federal defendants prior to the release of grant funds.  The Grant Agreement also mandates \nthat there be significant local community input to the HOPE VI process including the convening \nof a Community Task Force. \n31.  The 1999 HUD Notice of Funding Availability for the HOPE VI Program, 64 Fed. Reg. \n9618, 9627-8 (Feb.26 1999) states that successful applicants \"will have a duty to affirmatively \nfurther fair housing.\" \n11  \n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 1    Entered on FLSD Docket 09/06/2001   Page 12 of 42\nB.  The Unifom1 Relocation Act Requirements \n32.  Congress passed the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition \nPolicies Act (the \"Uniform Relocation Act\" or \"URA''), 42 U.S.C. ~ 4601 et seq., in order to \nensure that persons displaced from their homes as a result of government action are resettled into \nnew homes following certain procedures and are not materially disadvantaged by their forced \nrelocation. \n33.  In particular, the URA and its implementing regulations specify that: \na.  \"A displacing agency, before approving a project, must assess the characteristics and \nneeds of the households to be displaced (42 U.S.C. ~ 4625(c), 49 C.F.R. ~ 24.205 (c)(2)(i)), and \ndetermine whether qualified replacement housing is available to meet those needs.\"  49 C.F.R. ~ \n24.205(a)(2), 24 C.F.R. ~ 970.8(d)(3). \nb.  A displacing agency must \"[a]ssure that a person not be required to move from a \ndwelling unless the person has had a reasonable opportunity to relocate to a comparable \nreplacement dwelling ... \" 42 U.S.C. § 4625(c)(3).  The URA defines the term \"comparable \nreplacement dwelling\" as a \"dwelling that is (I) decent. safe and sanitary: (2) adequate in size to \naccommodate the occupants: (3) within the financial means ofthe displaced person: (4) \nfunctionally equivalent; (5) in an area not subject to unreasonable adverse environmental \nconditions; and (6) in a location generally not less desirable than the location of the displaced \nperson's dwelling with respect to public utilities, facilities, services, and the displaced person's \nplace of employment.\"  42 U.S.C. § 4601(10). \nc.  \"Wherever possible, minority persons shall be given reasonable opportunities to \nrelocate to decent, safe and sanitary replacement dwellings, not located in an area of minority \n12 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 1    Entered on FLSD Docket 09/06/2001   Page 13 of 42\n* \nconcentration. that are within their financial means.\"  49 C.F.R.  24.205(c)(2). \nC.  Community Development Block Grant Requirements \n34.  The Community Development Block Grant (\"CDBG\") Program was created pursuant to \nTitle I of the Housing and Community Development Act (\"HCDA\"). as amended. codified at 42 \n* \nU.S.C.  5301 et seq.  The primary objective ofthe HCDA is \"the development of viable urban \ncommunities, by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment and expanding \neconomic opportunities, principally for persons of low and moderate income.\"  42 U .S.C. § \n5301(a).  For purposes ofthe HCDA, \"low income\" is defined as 0% to 50% of area median \nincome, and \"moderate income\" is defined as 50% to 80% of area median income.  24 C.F.R. § \n570.3. \n35.  In any development project assisted under the CDBG Program, there must be a residential \nanti-displacement and relocation assistance plan in place that provides, among other things, that: \na.  governmental agencies or private developers shall provide within the same community \ncomparable replacement dwellings for the same number of occupants as could have been housed \nin the occupied and vacant occupiable low and moderate income dwelling units demolished or \nconverted to a use other than for housing low and moderate income persons, and provide that \nsuch replacement housing may include existing housing assisted with project based assistance \nprovided under section 1437f of this title.  42 U.S.C. § 5304(d)(2)(A)(i); \nb.  such comparable replacement dwellings shall be designed to remain affordable to \npersons of low and moderate income for 10 years from the time of initial occupancy.  42 U.S.C. \n§ 5304(d)(2)(A)(ii); \nc.  in the case of displaced persons of low and moderate income, provide ... compensation \n13 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 1    Entered on FLSD Docket 09/06/2001   Page 14 of 42\nsufficient to insure that, for a 5-year period, the displaced families shall not bear, after relocation. \na ratio of shelter costs to income that exceeds 30 percent.  42 U.S.C. § 5304(d)(2)(A)(iii)(l): \nd.  Persons displaced shall be relocated into comparable replacement housing that is -\ndecent. safe and sanitary: adequate in size to accommodate the occupants: functionally \nequivalent: and in an area not subject to unreasonably adverse environmental  conditions.  42 \nU.S.C. ~ 5304(d)(2)(A)(iv). \nD.  Fair Housing Act Requirements \n36.  The Fair Housing Act provides that \"it shall be unlawful\": \na.  \"To ... make unavailable or deny [] a dwelling to any person because of race, color, .. \n. sex, [or] familial status ... \" 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a): or \nb.  \"To discriminate against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of ... rental \nof a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith, because of race, \ncolor, sex [or] familial status ... \" 42 U.S.C. § 3604(b); or \nc. \"To make, print or publish or cause to be made, printed or published any notice [or] \nstatement. .. with respect to the sale or rental of a dwelling that indicates any preference ... based on \nrace, color, ... or national origin, or an intention to make such preference ... \" 42 U.S.C. § 3604(c). \n37.  The Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3608(e){5), further provides the \"Secretary of Housing \nand Urban Development shall ... administer the programs and activities relating to housing and \nurban development in a manner to affirmatively further the policies of [the Fair Housing Act]. \nE.  Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act Requirements \n38.  The Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1988,42 U.S.C. § 1437c-l(b), \nrequires every public housing authority to prepare and submit for HUD approval an \"annual \n14 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 1    Entered on FLSD Docket 09/06/2001   Page 15 of 42\npublic housing agency plan\" detailing the PHA's policies in the administration of its programs. \nThe Act further requires the PHA to certify in that plan that it will \"carry out the public housing \nagency plan in confom1ity with ... the Fair Housing Act...and will affirmatively further fair \nhousing. \nF.  Title VI of the Civil Rights Act Requirements \n39.  Title VI ofthe Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides that \"[njo person in the United States \nshalL on the grounds of race, color or national origin. be excluded from participation in, be \ndenied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under, any program or activity receiving \nFederal financial assistance.\"  42 U.S.C. § 2000d. \nG.  National Environmental Policy Act \n40.  The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C.§§ 4321 et seq., requires that \nevery \"major Federal  action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment\" must \nbe accompanied by a detailed analysis of the environmental impacts of the project. \n41.  HUD has  issued regulations implementing NEPA at 24 C.F.R. Parts 50 & 58.  Those \nregulations provide that either an Environmental Assessment and a Finding of No Significant \nImpact or a full Environmental Impact Statement shall be completed \"prior to the approval \naction\" unless the action is considered exempt.  24 C.F.R. § 50.16.

Scott Homes Public Housing Development \n44.  Scott Homes Public Housing Project is a 754-unit public housing project located in the \nLiberty City neighborhood of north central Miami-Dade County.  The Scott Homes project was \nconstructed in 1953 and is one of the largest public housing communities in Florida. \n45.  Collectively, Scott Homes and the neighboring Carver Homes public housing \ndevelopment contain a total of 850 conventional public housing rental units consisting of: 8 one \nbedroom units, 312 two-bedroom units, 400 three-bedroom units, 75 four-bedroom units. 53 \nfive-bedroom units. and 2 six-bedroom units. \n46.  Scott Homes has always housed an African American population and  nearly all (99%) of \nthe residents are African American. The population of Scott homes is also very poor. According \nto the County defendants' 1999 HOPE VI application, the average household income of Scott \nHomes residents households is $7,238 a year ( 17% of the area median income). \n16 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 1    Entered on FLSD Docket 09/06/2001   Page 17 of 42\n47.  The population of the Scott-Carver complex consists of many large households residing \nin units with four or more bedrooms. It is the plaintiffs' informed belief that all or nearly all of \nthese large households include minor children. Overall, according to data published by federal \ndefendants. 84 percent of households in Scott Homes and the neighboring Carver Homes (which \nwill also be demolished) are families with children. \n48.  Despite the poverty of the community. there are many attractive aspects to the \nneighborhood.  As stated in the County's HOPE VI application. it is located near numerous retail \nstores, including the Northside Shopping Center, which is slated for a $25 million redevelopment \nand expansion by the Urban League of Greater Miami. A neighborhood family health center is \nused by over 100 Scott and Carver Homes residents daily. Nearby are also two public parks, a \n$3.2 million Youth Education Town Center providing recreation and education programs to \nneighborhood families. The three elementary schools that serve the Scott Homes neighborhood \nare currently undergoing a $5 million capital improvements program. The Scott Homes \nneighborhood has convenient access to Metrobus and Metrorail public transportation services. \nMoreover, many of the residents of Scott Homes have lived in this neighborhood for decades and \nhave strongly rooted ties and commitments to this area. \nB.  The Federal Housing Programs Administered by the County defendants \n49.  The Miami-Dade County Commission, acting through the Miami Dade Housing Agency, \nis the principal provider of housing affordable to very low income families in Miami-Dade \nCounty.  According to data published by HUD, the Miami-Dade Housing Agency administers \napproximately  II ,000  units of conventional public housing in both elderly and family public \nhousing developments.  Of these, half, approximately 5,500, of the units are family units and the \n17 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 1    Entered on FLSD Docket 09/06/2001   Page 18 of 42\nremaining are for occupancy by elderly persons only. \n50.  In general, rents for conventional public housing units are set at 30 percent of the income \nof the household that resides in the unit. As such. conventional public housing provide some of \nthe only housing guaranteed to be affordable to very low income and extremely low income1 \nhouseholds. \n51.  The Miami-Dade Housing Agency has a waiting list for its public housing. According to \ndata published by the defendant HUD, the average household spends 1.5 years on the County's \npublic housing waiting list before being admitted to a dwelling unit. \n52.  In March 2001, the Housing Agency opened up its public housing waiting list for the first \ntime in many years.  The list remained open for approximately 10 days and the Housing Agency \nreceived over 63,000 applications for assistance.  The larger families who applied for \nassistance, those who needed four, five and six bedroom units, were overwhelmingly African \nAmerican. \n53.  The Miami-Dade Housing Agency also administers a federal Housing Choice Voucher \nProgram (formerly known as the \"Section 8 Voucher Program\"). The Housing Agency has \nauthority to administer these portable tenant-based subsidies that families are supposed to be able \nto use to rent housing on the private rental market. Private landlords in Miami-Dade County are \nnot required to participate in the Housing Choice Voucher Program. \n54.  The Miami metropolitan area was identified by the federal defendants in September 2000 \n1 Following the usual HUD classifications, \"low income\" households have incomes higher \nthan 50 but not more than 80 percent of area median income, \"very low income\" households have \nincomes higher than 30 but not more than 50 percent of area median income. \"extremely low \nincome\" households have incomes at or below 30 percent of area median income. \n18 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 1    Entered on FLSD Docket 09/06/2001   Page 19 of 42\nas an area with severe geographic concentrations of Housing Choice voucher families. According \nto the federal defendants, 25 percent or more ofthe families renting housing in the Miami \nmetropolitan area with vouchers are concentrated in 5 percent of the area's census tracts. \nC.  The Affordable Housing Crisis in Miami-Dade County \n55.  Miami-Dade County is in the midst of an affordable housing crisis, particularly for very \npoor African American families.  In 1998, as a requirement of receiving federal Community \nDevelopment Block Grant (''CDBG\") funding Miami-Dade County developed a Five-Year \nConsolidated Plan (\"Consolidated Plan'') to assess the County's housing needs and to plan for \naddressing these needs. \n56.  The 1998 Consolidated Plan singled out the exact type of families living in Scott Homes \nas suffering the worst housing needs.  The Plan identified very poor large families, with incomes \nless than 30 percent of area median income, equal to $12,600 per year, as the group with the most \ncritical housing needs. Of this group, 93% lacked adequate affordable housing. Almost 70 \npercent of this group were paying over 50 percent of their monthly income in rent. \n57.  Indeed the Consolidated Plan identified this group as \"threatened with homelessness,'' \nstating, ''For these households, the loss of a job, an injury that interrupts a paycheck, a slight \nincrease in rent, or some other sudden change in income will result in a missed rent payment and \nthe loss of shelter.\" \n58.  Moreover. according to the Consolidated Plan, the impact of this crisis is borne to a \ndisproportionate degree by African American households.  While African American households \nmake up 20% ofthe population of Miami-Dade County, they compose 32% ofthe extremely \nlow income renters. \n19 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 1    Entered on FLSD Docket 09/06/2001   Page 20 of 42\n59.  Finally, the Consolidated Plan also documents that this affordable housing crisis for large \nextremely low income families will only get worse.  The Consolidated Plan estimates a need for \nan additional 4,000 units of rental housing affordable to low income renters just to maintain the \ncurrent status quo. \nD.  The County Defendants' Application and Plans for the HOPE VI Redevelopment of Scott \nHomes \n60.  The County defendants initially applied for a HOPE VI grant for Scott Homes in 1996. \nThat proposal provided for the selective demolition of only 149 units and resulted in a \ncommunity  with over 500 units of rehabilitated public housing and 100 market rate rental units \ncombined with an extensive home ownership program.  The stated goal of the plan was that \nnone of the current residents would be relocated.  That application was not funded by federal \ndefendants. \n61.  The County defendants again applied unsuccessfully for HOPE VI grants for Scott \nHomes in 1997 and 1998. \n62.  Finally, on May 17, 1999, the County defendants submitted their current HOPE VI \napplication to federal defendants. In September 1999, the federal defendant announced that the \nCounty defendants were  awarded  a $35 million dollar HOPE VI grant to \"revitalize\" the Scott \nHomes and Carver Homes deveiopments. \n63.  The 1999 application provides for the demolition of 850 units of public housing and the \nreplacement of these units with 80 units of conventional rental public housing, 135 units of \"rent \nto own\" public  housing, and 247 units of other home ownership housing on the Scott-Carver site \nand in the surrounding neighborhood. \n20 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 1    Entered on FLSD Docket 09/06/2001   Page 21 of 42\n64.  The conventional rental public housing planned as part of the 1999 application consists of \n2 one-bedroom units, 25 two-bedroom units, 43 three-bedroom units, 8 four-bedroom units, 2 \nfive-bedroom units, and zero six-bedroom units. The \"rent to own\" public housing will consist of \n1 one-bedroom units, 53 two-bedroom units. 68 three-bedroom units, 12 four-bedroom units, 1 \nfive-bedroom units, and zero six-bedroom units. \n65.  Taking into account the smaller number of multi-bedroom replacement units, the \ndefendants' HOPE VI plan will result in shortfall of over 400 \"comparable replacement \ndwellings\" as defined under the Housing and Community Development Act. \n66.  The defendants' HOPE VI plan will result in the net loss of 770 conventional public \nhousing rental units, an over 90 percent reduction in the number of such units in the Scott-Carver \ncomplex.  Access to these units will be restricted, as the  defendants plan to impose additional \nundisclosed eligibility criteria which could exclude many current Scott Homes residents and \nwaiting list families.  Plaintiffs and other residents have repeatedly requested that any proposed \neligibility criteria be disclosed prior to relocation so that current residents can participate in their \ndevelopment and implementation.  Defendants have consistently refused to do so. \n67.  The 135 units of\"rent to own\" public housing in the \"revitalized Scott Homes \ncommunity\" may or may not be affordable to the families currently residing in Scott Homes, \ndepending on the eligibility criteria and the program requirements. The  defendants currently \nhave no \"rent to own\" public housing program, and they have not developed any criteria or \nprocedures for implementing such a program. The  defendants have consistently refused to \ndisclose their plans for any \"rent to own\" public housing program, despite repeated requests by \nthe plaintiffs and other residents that they do so. \n21 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 1    Entered on FLSD Docket 09/06/2001   Page 22 of 42\n68.  According to the  defendants' HOPE VI application, very few of the  families who \ncurrently reside at Scott Homes will be able to qualify for, or afford. one of the 24 7 home \nownership units which comprise the remainder of the replacement housing  planned in the \nCounty's HOPE VI application.  The County's application states that the minimum \"qualifying \nincome\" for a one-bedroom home ownership dwelling is $I 2, 126, fully two-thirds more than the \naverage annual income of a Scott Homes or Carver Homes family. The situation is even worse \nfor multi-bedroom home ownership units needed by large families.  The application identities the \nminimum qualifying income for a four-bedroom home ownership dwelling as being  between \n$23,596 and $24,330, over three times the average annual income of a Scott Homes or Carver \nHomes family. \nE.  Miami-Dade County Commission Resolution No. 0 I I 002 \n69.  On May 8, 2001, in response to advocacy by residents, the Miami-Dade County \nCommission passed Resolution 011002, which authorized the construction of an additional 175 \nunits of project-based Section 8 housing in the area surrounding the Scott Homes/Carver Homes \nHOPE VI site for use by displaced tenants.  The Commission explicitly stated that this additional \nhousing was not part of the HOPE VI process and that the resolution in no way modified the \nHOPE VI proposal to federal defendants.  This additional housing was not included in the HOPE \nVI Relocation Plan approved by federal defendants. Thus, the Commission has reserved the right \nto modify or repeal the resolution at any time. \n70.  After the enactment of Resolution, the County defendants  stated that the 175 project-\nbased Section 8 units would be limited to occupancy by elderly and disabled persons. While \nthere has been no commitment to the bedroom size of these additional units, it is the plaintiffs' \n22 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 1    Entered on FLSD Docket 09/06/2001   Page 23 of 42\ninfom1ed beliefthat this unilaterally imposed elderly and disabled occupancy limitation will \neffectively result in units with few bedrooms. \n71.  Apart from describing this new occupancy restriction, as  of the date of the tiling of this \ncomplaint, the County defendants have taken no steps to implement Resolution 0 II 002.  The \nrelocation of residents is commencing prior to any attempts to site or construct this additional \nhousing. The County defendants have made no commitment that construction will be completed \nin a timely manner so that the housing can actually be used by any displaced Scott Homes \nresidents. \nF.  The County Defendants' Racial Motives for Their HOPE VI Plan \n72.  The County defendants held presentations for the residents of Scott Homes and the \nsurrounding community just prior to the submission of their 1999 application. At these \npresentations, the County defendants stated that one of the reasons that they targeted Scott \nHomes for a HOPE VI application was the their belief that the large concentration of\"minority\" \nfamilies in Liberty City would make their application more attractive. \n73.  In their presentation to the residents, the County defendants stated that one of the \nsignificant elements of a \"winning application\" is \"discouraging concentrations of minorities.'' \nThus, Scott Homes residents began to learn that their community was chosen for demolition and \nthat they were to be displaced from their neighborhood and excluded from millions of dollars in \nplanned \"replacement\" housing, because of their race. \n74.  The County defendants included materials describing their goal of\"discouraging \nconcentrations of minorities\" in their 1999 HOPE VI application to federal defendants. \nG.  The Displacement and Relocation of Scott Homes Families \n23 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 1    Entered on FLSD Docket 09/06/2001   Page 24 of 42\n75.  Because the  defendants' plan to rebuild only a small fraction of the conventional public \nhousing units that will demolished as part of the HOPE VI redevelopment the families currently \nresiding in Scott Homes will be forced to relocate to other public housing developments or to \nprivate rental housing using Housing Choice vouchers (formerly known as \"Section 8\" \nvouchers).  This will create significant hardships and potential homelessness for many Scott \nHomes families. and will exacerbate the County's affordable housing crisis. \n76.  The use of public housing as relocation housing for displaced families will strain an \nalready scarce affordable housing resource. According to data published by the federal \ndefendants, the average household spends 1.5 years on the County's public housing waiting list \nbefore being admitted to a dwelling unit. \n77.  The only other type of relocation subsidy being proposed for Scott Homes families is \ntenant-based Housing Choice vouchers (formerly known as ·'Section 8 vouchers\") administered \nby the  defendants with federal funding. The Housing Choice voucher  program is a federal \nhousing subsidy program which pays subsidies on behalf of individual households to allow them \nto rent private units in the local housing market. \n78.  However, the ability of very poor African American families, particularly large families, \nto use Housing Choice vouchers in Miami-Dade County is greatly limited by the nature of the \nprogram and the County's tight housing market. It is extremely difficult for families in Miami \nDade County to secure housing with Housing Choice vouchers on the private market and \nvirtually impossible for large t~unilies to locate units with a sufficient number of bedrooms. In \naddition, many landlords simply will not accept vouchers for reasons ranging from fear of \nbureaucracy to bias against poor families to racism. \n24 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 1    Entered on FLSD Docket 09/06/2001   Page 25 of 42\n79.  In Miami-Dade County, subsidy payment standards for Housing Choice vouchers are \nbased on HUD-calculated Fair Market Rent (\"FMR\") figures set at the 50th percentile of rents in \nthe local housing market. The FMRs are intended to reflect the lower half of total rental housing \nmarkets in particular areas. However, rents for newly constructed units are excluded from the \ncalculation of this 50th percentile figure, which means that FMR levels are probably lower than \nthe 50th percentile. \n80.  Public housing authorities have authority to set voucher payment standards at levels \nbetween 90 and II 0 percent of the HUD-calculated FMR. The Miami-Dade Housing Agency \n(\"MDHA\") has set payment standards for its vouchers at 100 percent of the FMR for Miami \nDade County. \n81.  If a family is able to find a unit renting at the payment standard or less, the family pays \n30 percent of its income towards housing costs and the subsidy covers the rest. If a family finds a \nunit renting at an amount higher than the payment standard, the family must pay 30 percent of its \nincome plus I 00 percent of the difference between the rent tor the unit and the payment standard, \nwhich can add up to substantially more than 30 percent of its income. However, families are \nprohibited from moving into a new unit with a voucher if the family would stand to pay more \nthan 40 percent of its income for housing costs. \n82.  Tenants who obtain a voucher must find a suitable unit on their own, negotiate an \nagreement with the landlord, and receive approval from MDHA, ordinarily within 60 days. \n83.  MDHA approval is conditioned on, among other things, units passing an exacting \nHousing Quality Standards (\"HQS\") inspection, which often eliminates units renting at an \naffordable price. Additionally, few landlords renting these lower priced units are willing to hold \n25 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 1    Entered on FLSD Docket 09/06/2001   Page 26 of 42\nthem otT the market for the week or two while this inspection is accomplished and paperwork \nprocess is completed. \n84.  In fact, because of delays involved in the HQS process, MDHA 's public housing agency \nplan specifically authorizes extensions to the usual 60-day deadline where units are undergoing \nHQS inspection. \n85.  As a result, plaintiffs are informed and believe that more than 25 percent of the Housing \nChoice vouchers issued in Miami-Dade County are returned unused and, as a result, forfeited by \nthe initial voucher holder and reissued by MDHA to the next eligible family on the waiting list. \n86.  In addition, most voucher holders who successfully locate a rental unit  end up living in \nneighborhoods with high concentrations of voucher assisted households.  The Miami \nmetropolitan area was identified by federal defendants in September 2000 as an area with severe \ngeographic concentrations of Housing Choice voucher families, with at least 25 percent of \nvoucher families residing in only 5 percent of the area's census tracts. \n87.  Finally, unlike public housing, a landlord can cancel its voucher Housing Assistance \nPayments (\"HAP\") contract with MDHA at the end of the family's initial lease terms (which can \nbe less than one year) or at the end of any month after the initial lease term for any reason. At \nthat time, because families are unable to afford private units without voucher subsidies, they \nmust once again search for new housing and sutTer the substantial risk that they will forfeit their \nvouchers if they are unable to do so within MDHA 's 60-day deadline. \nH.  The Disparate Impact of the Defendants' HOPE VI Plans \n88.  The  defendants' HOPE VI plan will have a disproportionate adverse impact on African \nAmericans living in the Scott Carver complex. \n26 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 1    Entered on FLSD Docket 09/06/2001   Page 27 of 42\n89.  As a result of the  defendants' HOPE VI plan. the over 600 families remaining in the \nScott Homes and Carver Homes developments will be expelled from their community. Their \nhomes will be demolished and nearly all of these families will be excluded from the new housing \nthe  detendants plan to construct due to the small number of affordable public housing units \nincluded in the 1999 HOPE Vl plan. \n90.  Over 99 percent of the tamilies residing in the Scott-Carver complex are African \nAmerican. In contrast. African American households comprise only 64 percent of the total \nhouseholds residing in MDHA public housing and only 20 percent of the total population of \nMiami-Dade County. \n91.  Families with children make up 83 percent of the Scott Homes households.  However. \nthey comprise only 39 percent of the total households in in MDHA public housing and only 33.8 \npercent ofthe total Miami-Dade County population. \n92.  The  defendants' HOPE VI plans will result in a net loss of hundreds of public housing \nunits in Miami-Dade County.  A total of 770 units of guaranteed affordable rental housing will \nbe lost at a time when the County is in the middle of an affordable housing crisis. \n93.  Forty one percent ofthe households on the County's public housing waiting list are \nidentified by the County defendants as African Americans.  This figure is twice the percentage of \nAfrican Americans in the Miami-Dade County total. \n94.  The  defendants' HOPE VI plan will cause especially severe harm to large families \nresiding in Scott Homes and on the MDHA public housing waiting list.  This harm will in turn \nfall most heavily on African Americans and families with children. \n27 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 1    Entered on FLSD Docket 09/06/2001   Page 28 of 42\n95.  Large families will be almost completely excluded from the new housing the  defendants' \nplan to construct due to the dramatic reduction in the number of four- and tive-bedroom public \nhousing rental units. There are currently 125 units with four or more bedrooms in Scott Homes \nand Carver Homes. Of these, 52 are five- or six-bedroom units. After the HOPE VI \nredevelopment, there will be only 8 four-bedroom, 2 live-bedroom, and zero six-bedroom units \navailable as traditional rental public housing.  In addition, 12 four bedroom units  and I tivc \nbedroom unit will be constructed as  \"rent to own\" public housing. This represents an 84 percent \nreduction in the number of public housing units with four or more bedrooms. \n96.  It is the plaintiffs' further informed belief that Section 8 Housing Choice vouchers will be \na largely useless form of relocation assistance for large Scott-Carver families because there are \nextremely few units with four or more bedrooms in the Miami-Dade County rental market. \nI.  The Failure of Defendants to Analyze the Racial and Socioeconomic Effects of Their \nHOPE VI  Decisions and Federal Defendants's Decision to Fund the  Defendants' Racially \nMotivated Plan \n97.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that, apart from targeting Scott Homes and Carver \nHomes based on the race of the families residing in these developments, the  defendants \nperformed no analysis of the racial and socioeconomic effects of their HOPE VJ plan. \n1.  The Defendants' Failure to Assess the Environmental impact of their HOPE VI Plan \n98.  No environmental assessment has been completed by County defendants.  Despite the \nabsence of an environmental assessment  the defendants are expending funds with respect to the \nproject, specifically including preparations for the relocation of the residents. \n28 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 1    Entered on FLSD Docket 09/06/2001   Page 29 of 42\nK.  The Defendants' Exclusion of Scott Homes Residents from the HOPE VI Process \n99.  The impact ofthe HOPE VI grant has been greatly exacerbated by the tailure of the \nCounty defendants to permit the residents to be involved in the HOPE VI revitalization process. \nDespite the express requirements of the HOPE VI statute and guidelines the residents have not \nbeen meaningfully involved in the development or implementation of the HOPE VI plan. \nIndeed, as described above, despite repeated pleas of the plaintiffs and other residents. many \ncrucial elements of the plan have yet to  be developed.  All of the County defendants' energies \nhave been focused on the prompt relocation of the residents and the demolition of their homes. \nI 00.  As a result of the County defendants' failure to proceed with respect to any of the \nsupportive services or programmatic portions of the HOPE VI process. while at the same time \nproceeding with the relocation of the residents. many residents. including the plaintiffs,  are now \nfaced with being relocated prior to having any input into the development of the revitalization \nplan and from participating in any of the services or opportunities which were proposed to be \nprovided by the Community and Supportive Services portion of the application. \nVI.  IRREPARABLE INJURY \n101.  These actions have caused and will cause irreparable injury to the plaintitTs. The \ndefendants are in the process of destroying the community where the plaintiffs live and have \nestablished personal ties. As a result of the defendants' actions, the plaintiffs  have lost or will \nlose their homes, have suffered or will suffer displacement from their community, and most of \nthem will be denied the opportunity to reside in the revitalized housing that is currently proposed \nby the defendants. The  defendants have engaged in purposeful or knowing  conduct that violates \nthe plaintiffs' civil rights. \n29 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 1    Entered on FLSD Docket 09/06/2001   Page 30 of 42\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nFAIR HOUSING/CIVIL RIGHTS CLAIMS \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Against County Defendants) \nViolation of the Fa*ir  Housing Act.

The Scott Homes HOPE VI project is currently utilizing  $2,000.000 in Community \nDevelopment Block Grant funds in the development of the project.  As part of the project \napproximately 850 units of housing affordable to very low income households are being \ndemolished.  However, the County defendants are replacing no more than 521  units.  Moreover, \nthe County defendants have specitically failed to replace units for larger families.

Section 104(d) ofthe Housing and Community Development Act, 42 U.S.C.~ 5304(d) \nprovides that in any development project assisted under the Community Development Block \nGrant Program, there must be a residential anti-displacement and relocation assistance plan in \nplace that conforms to the requirements of the section. \n128.  The Scott Homes HOPE VI project is currently utilizing  $2,000,000 in Community \nDevelopment Block Grant funds in the development of the project.  However, at no time have \nCounty defendants developed a residential anti-displacement and relocation assistance plan that \nconforms to the requirements of the Housing and Community Development Act. \nTHIRTEENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Against Federal Defendants) \nViolation of the Housing and Community Development Act, 42 U.S.C. § 5304(d) \nand 5 U.S.C. ~ 701. \n129.  All plaintiffs repeat and reallege Paragraphs I through I 0 I as if set out in full. \n130.  Federal defendants authorization of County defendants proceeding to relocate plaintiffs \ndespite the failure of the County defendants to comply with the terms of the Housing and \nCommunity Development Act a:o. set forth in~~ 123  through 128  violates plaintiffs' rights under \nthat Act. \n35 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 1    Entered on FLSD Docket 09/06/2001   Page 36 of 42\nFOURTEENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Against All Defendants) \nViolation of the Uniform Relocation Assistance And Real Property Acquisition Act of 1970 \nand Implementing Regulations \n131.  Plaintiffs Reese. Bailey and L.l.F.F.T.  repeat and reallege Paragraphs 1 through 101  as \nif set out in full. \n132.  The Uniform Relocation Assistance And Real Property Acquisition Act of 1970, as \namended, 42 U.S.C. ~ 4601, et seq., and implementing HUD regulations provides that in any \nproject assisted with federal funds no one may be displaced unless there is a comparable. \naffordable, decent, safe and sanitary unit available to serve as replacement housing.  HUD has \nimplemented the Act through regulations at 24 C.F.R. Part 42. \n133.  Plaintiffs, at the time of their displacement, will be  \"displaced persons\" within the \nmeaning of the Act in that they will be displaced as a direct result of a development financially \nassisted by HUD.  Nevertheless, defendants have failed and refused to develop a relocation plan \nthat conforms to the requirements of the Act and the implementing regulations. \n134.  The Relocation Plan developed by defendants fails to conform to the Act in numerous \nrespects.  Specifically, the Plan fails to provide the following: \n( 1) That relocation  housing must be in a location no less desirable than the displacement \nhousing; \n(2) That relocation housing must be in a location accessible to the relocatees work, the \nrelocatee's children's school, and other necessary facilities; \n(3) That relocation assistance can. at the option of the tenant, be provided in a lump sum \nfor the purposes of purchasing a dwelling; \n36 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 1    Entered on FLSD Docket 09/06/2001   Page 37 of 42\n(4  ) That the tenant may, at their option, choose either a lump sum payment calculated as \nset forth in the regulations or reimbursement for actual moving expenses; \n(5) That the tenant has a right to appeal any adverse determination tirst to the County and \nthen to HUD and that notices will inform the tenant of this right: \n(6) That the tenant has a right to additional financial assistance if a comparable \nreplacement dwelling rented with the Section 8 voucher would require the tenant to pay \nmore than 30% of their income in rent. \n135.  In addition to the foregoing, the reliance by defendants upon Section 8 vouchers in a \nhousing market in which such vouchers are extremely difficult to use, violates the guarantee that \nthe displaced person will be guaranteed adequate replacement housing for at least 42 months. \nFIFTEENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Against All Defendants) \nViolation ofthe National Environmental Policy Act  (NEPA), 42 U.S.C.9 432I et seq., \nand implementing regulations. \nI36.  All plaintiffs repeat and reallege Paragraphs I through I 0 I as if set out in full. \nI37.  The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C.§ 432I et seq., and the \nimplementing regulations  require a full environmental assessment prior to the funding of any \nsignificant federal action.  The environmental assessment must be completed prior to any final \ndetermination as to whether to proceed with the project and before there is any irreparable \nimpact. \nI38.  In the present case no environmental assessment has been completed.  Despite the \nabsence of an environmental assessment  the defendants arc expending funds with respect to the \nproject, specifically including preparations for the relocation of the residents.

In their motion, Plaintiffs seek to\ncertify two classes of Plaintiffs. The first class is composed\nof \"[a]ll African-American individuals residing in Scott Homes\nPublic Housing Project as of September 17, 1999.\" The second\nclass is composed of \"[a]ll African-American families who\ncurrently are, or will in the future be, on the Miami Dade\nHousing Agency public housing waiting list.\" In an order dated\nMay 24, 2002, however, the Court held that the waiting list\ntenants (the second proposed class) could not establish Article\nIII standing and, therefore, were dismissed from this lawsuit.\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 136    Entered on FLSD Docket 07/03/2002   Page 2 of 6\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA\nAccordingly, to the extent Plaintiffs' motion seeks to certify a\nclass of individuals on the public housing waiting list, such\nmotion should be denied. Conversely, for the reasons that follow,\nPlaintiffs' motion to certify a class of individuals currently\nresiding at Scott Homes, should be granted.\nDiscussion1\nA class action determination is left to the sound discretion\nof the district court. Jaffree v. Wallace, 705 F.2d 1526, 1536\n(11th Cir. 1983). Class certification is strictly a procedural\nmatter and the merits of the claims at stake are not considered\nwhen determining the propriety of the class action vehicle.\nEisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156 (1974). The district\ncourt may consider both allegations of the complaint and\nsupplemental evidentiary submissions of the parties. Blackie v.\nBarrack, 524 F.2d 891, 901 n.17 (9th Cir. 1975).\nRule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governs the\ncertification and maintenance of class actions. Rule 23(a)\nstates that one or more members of a class may sue or be sued as\nrepresentative parties on behalf of all only if: (1) the class is\nIn a contemporaneously issued order, the Court has\ndetailed the factual background of this case. Accordingly, in\nthis order, the Court will proceed directly to the analysis of\nthe certification issue.\n-2-\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 136    Entered on FLSD Docket 07/03/2002   Page 3 of 6\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA\nso numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2)\nquestions of law or fact common to the class exist; (3) the\nclaims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of\nthe claims or defenses of the class; (4) the representative\nparties can fairly and adequately protect the interest of the\nclass. Once these four elements of Rule 23(a) have been\nsatisfied, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the action falls\nwithin one of three categories set forth in Rule 23(b). The\nrelevant category in this case is subsection (2). For an action\nto fall within this subsection, the plaintiff must demonstrate\nthat \"the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on\ngrounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making\nappropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory\nrelief with respect to the class as a whole.\" Fed. R. Civ. P.\n23 (b) (2) .\nHere, Defendants only argument is that Plaintiffs have not\ndemonstrated the fourth element of Rule 23(a); namely, that the\nrepresentative parties will fairly and adequately protect the\ninterest of the class.2 Defendants claim that antagonism exists\nDefendants asserted several jurisdictional arguments in\nopposition to Plaintiffs' motion for class certification. In an\norder dated May 24, 2002, the Court ruled on those issues.\nAccordingly, Defendants only remaining argument is that\n-3-\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 136    Entered on FLSD Docket 07/03/2002   Page 4 of 6\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA\namong the class members regarding the benefits of the HOPE VI\nplan. Defendants state that, unlike the named Plaintiffs, many\nof Scott Homes' current tenants support the HOPE VI project and\nwish to see implementation of the project as currently\nconfigured.\nAs mentioned, Rule 23(a) (4) requires the movant to show that\nthe representative party will fairly and adequately protect the\ninterests of the class. To determine if a party seeking class\ncertification has met his or her burden, courts must determine:\n(1) that the plaintiff's attorney is qualified, experienced and\nwill competently and vigorously prosecute the suit; and (2) that\nthe interest of the class representative is not antagonistic to\nor in conflict with other members of the class. See,\nKirkpatrick v. J.C. Bradford, 827 F.2d 718, 726 (11th Cir. 1987);\nGriffin v. Carlin, 755 F.2d 1516, 1533 (11th Cir.1985).3\nClass actions, however, are not forbidden in every case in\nwhich class members disagree. Horton v. Goose Creek Indep. Sch.\nDist., 690 F.2d 470, 486 (5th Cir. 1982). Obviously, \"[i]n any\nPlaintiffs have not demonstrated that the representative parties\nwill fairly and adequately protect the interest of the class.\nIn this case, the Court notes that Plaintiffs' attorneys\nare qualified, experienced, and appear ready to competently and\nvigorously prosecute this action.\n-4-\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 136    Entered on FLSD Docket 07/03/2002   Page 5 of 6\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA\nconceivable case, some of the members of the class will wish to\nassert their rights while other will not wish to do Id.\nSO.II\nHere, the Court finds that the interests of the Scott Homes'\ntenants who support implementation of the HOPE VI plan as\ncurrently configured, are adequately protected. Although some of\nthe Scott Homes' tenants may disagree with the named Plaintiffs,\ntheir position has been asserted \"energetically and forcefullyll\nby the two governmental Defendants responsible for administering\nthe HOPE VI plan. See, Horton, at 487. The Court is mindful of\nthe apparent dangers in relying on the opponents of the class to\nrepresent the views of dissenting class members. Nevertheless,\nunlike many class action suits, the facts of this case reveal\nthat the interests of the dissenting class members are\nsufficiently intertwined with the interests of the governmental\nDefendants such that their views will be adequately safeguarded.\nAccordingly, the Court holds that the named Plaintiffs will\nfairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. 4\nShould the interests of the dissenting class members and the\ngovernmental Defendants become distinct, the Court will entertain\n4 The Court holds that Plaintiffs have met their burden of\ndemonstrating the existence of the remaining elements necessary\nfor class certification.\n-5-\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 136    Entered on FLSD Docket 07/03/2002   Page 6 of 6\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA\nmotions for decertification if appropriate.\nIn light of the foregoing, it is ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that\nPlaintiffs' motion to certify the class is GRANTED IN PART AND\nDENIED IN PART.

A hearing upon this matter was conducted on October 7, 2009.\nFor reasons set  forth below, the court has determined to grant the defendants’ motions and enter\nfinal summary judgment. \n  I.  Procedural Background      \nScott Homes and Carver Homes (collectively “Scott-Carver Homes”) are two public housing\ndevelopments located  in  Liberty City, Miami.  Built in 1954 and 1964, respectively, the projects\nwere  situate in Miami- Dade County and  operated at all material times by  the Miami- Dade County\nHousing Agency (MDHA).  \nPlaintiffs,  former residents of  Scott Homes, filed this class action lawsuit in 2001 against\ndefendants  Miami-Dade  County  and  the  United  States  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban\nDevelopment (HUD), alleging that the defendants discriminated against them on the basis of race\nin the  approval, funding  and implementation of a  revitalization plan for  Scott-Carver Homes.  At\nthe time the  lawsuit was  filed,  Scott-Carver Homes contained 850 public housing units and  99%\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 391    Entered on FLSD Docket 11/10/2009   Page 2 of 42\nof its residents were African-American.1\nAt the inception of the lawsuit,  plaintiffs  filed a  motion for  preliminary injunction seeking\nto halt the demolition of  Scott  Homes units and prevent  the “forced or voluntary” relocation of any\nScott  Homes residents in the County’s implementation of its revitalization plan.  A predecessor\njudge  denied the requested injunctive relief,  finding no likelihood of success on the merits on any\nof plaintiffs’  federal claims.  Reese v Miami Dade County,  242 F. Supp. 2d 1292 (S.D.  Fla. 2002),\naff’d, 77 Fed. Appx. 506 (11th Cir. 2003).  After that ruling was affirmed on appeal, defendants\nproceeded forward with demolition of the Scott-Carver Homes project.\nOn  September 30, 2003, the predecessor judge  ordered a  continuance of trial based on the\nthen  pendency of the parties’ original summary judgment motions (filed in November 2002).  [DE#\n299].  Although this order expressed the court’s intent to reset the case  for trial by separate order,\nthere was no further activity in the file  until  October 27, 2008,  when the case was  reassigned  to\nthis division. [DE# 299].  \nFollowing reassignment, this court ordered submission of updated summary judgment\nmotions and denied  the parties’ original summary judgment submissions as moot.  [DE# 308].   The\nparties have since  filed amended  summary judgment  motions [DE# #336, 337, 347 and 349] which\nare ripe for disposition.   \nII. The Complaint\nUnder their current complaint, plaintiffs   press forward  with  claims for declaratory  and\ninjunctive relief relating to the planned redevelopment of  the Scott-Carver project. Specifically,\n1The certified class consists of all African- American residents of Scott Carver Homes as of\nSeptember 17, 1999. \n2\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 391    Entered on FLSD Docket 11/10/2009   Page 3 of 42\nthey seek an injunction requiring the defendants to develop  and  implement a  revitalization plan\nfor Scott-Carver Homes which does not have a disparate  impact on African-American families,\ndoes not result  in a forced, permanent  relocation of  former Scott Homes residents, and  replaces\nall demolished  public housing  units on a one-to-one basis (850 units) in the Liberty City\nneighborhood around the original Scott Homes site.                 \nThey assert  following  constitutional and statutory claims: 2\n• Fair Housing Act  (42 U. S. C. §§ 3604 (a), (c),  42 U.S.C.  § 3608 (e)(5)) (Title VIII)\n• Title VI of Civil Rights Acts of 1964 (42 U.S.C. §2000d) \n• Equal Protection Claims ( Fourteenth Amendment, Fifth Amendment) \n• Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act (QHWRA) ( 42 U.S. C. §1437v)\n• Housing and Community Development Act (42 U.S.C. § 5304(d)(2)(A)(i))\nThe complaint names two sets of  defendants – the “County defendants,” consisting of\nMiami-Dade County, a  political subdivision of the State of Florida, and  the Director of the\nCounty’s Miami-Dade Housing Agency (“MDHA”),3  and   the “Federal defendants,” consisting of\nthe United  States  Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) and the Secretary of\n2  The predecessor judge dismissed plaintiffs’ claim against the County Defendants under the\nUniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition  Act of 1970 [DE# 137]. In  their\ncurrent summary judgment papers,  plaintiffs express an  intent to drop their corresponding claim\nagainst the Federal defendants  (Count 14) and their  FHA claim against the County defendants for\nintentional discrimination based on family   status (Count 2).\nIn an  earlier pretrial stipulation, plaintiffs voluntarily dropped their claim under the National\nEnvironmental Policy Act  (Count 15).  Pursuant to plaintiff’s voluntary notice of dismissal, these\nclaims, Counts 2, 14 and 15, shall  be dismissed with prejudice. \n3 Rene Rodriguez was originally named as defendant in this capacity.  The County defendants\nnote that he is succeeded  by current Interim Director Cynthia W. Curry, and request a corresponding\nsubstitution of party defendant.\n3\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 391    Entered on FLSD Docket 11/10/2009   Page 4 of 42\nHUD.4   \nThe thrust of plaintiffs’ complaint is that  the Defendants’ configuration of the Liberty City\nHOPE VI project was consciously designed  to discourage African-Americans from living in the\nredeveloped  Scott Homes neighborhood, and that the County’s revitalization plan, as approved by\nHUD, will result  in  “the destruction of desperately needed affordable housing for very poor families\nin the Scott Homes community, who are overwhelmingly African-American” and the “forced\ndisplacement of the predominantly African-American residents of the Scott Homes community.” \nIII.  Facts \nIn 1992, the Congressional Commission on Severely Distressed Public Housing was\nestablished to identify severely distressed or obsolete public housing developments and to offer\nsolutions for their revitalization.  The result of the Commission’s inquiry was the  “Homeownership\nand Opportunities for People Everywhere” or “HOPE VI”  program, a competitive grant program\ndesigned to prompt public housing agencies to develop and implement innovative strategies for the\nrevitalization of their  most troubled public housing projects and  surrounding neighborhoods. \nIn 1999, the HOPE VI  program was codified  at 42 U.S.C. § 1437v, when the Quality\nHousing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 (Public Housing Reform Act) amended section 24\nof the 1937 Act.  The goal of this  legislation is to stimulate  positive socio-economic change by:\n(1) improving the living environment for public housing residents of severely\ndistressed public housing projects through the demolition, rehabilitation, reconfiguration or replacement of obsolete public housing projects (or portions thereof);\n(2)  revitalizing sites (including remaining  public housing dwelling units) on which\n4  Mel Martinez was originally named as defendant in this capacity.  The federal defendants\nnote that he is succeeded by Shaun Donovan, and  request a corresponding  substitution of party\ndefendant pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(d).  \n4\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 391    Entered on FLSD Docket 11/10/2009   Page 5 of 42\nsuch public housing projects are located and contributing to the improvement of the\nsurrounding neighborhood;\n(3) providing housing that will avoid or decrease the concentration of very low-\nincome families; and\n(4) building sustainable mixed income communities.\n42 U.S.C. § 1437v(a)(1)-(4).    \nHOPE  VI  effected  numerous policy changes, including elimination of federally mandated\nadmission preferences,  repeal of   “one  for one replacement” requirements on demolished units, and\ntransfer of  admission standards to the control of  local housing authorities.  In addition, site selection\nrestrictions were lifted  for HOPE VI grantees, allowing recipients to redevelop housing on the\nfootprint of previously distressed public housing developments and in surrounding neighborhoods.\nHUD  is charged with responsibility for carrying out the Congressional purposes of the\nHOPE VI statute.  Toward this end, it  has developed a competitive funding process that rewards\napplicants who best demonstrate the  intent and ability to reduce concentrations of very low income\npopulations and create mixed income communities.  42 U.S.C. §1437v(e). 5  The statutory  purposes,\neligible activities and application  procedures of the HOPE VI program are enumerated in 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1437v(a), (d) and (e).\nIn 1996,  HUD  published  a Notice of  Funding  Availability  (“NOFA”)  seeking HOPE-\nVI grant applications from public housing authorities around the country.   Miami-Dade County\ndetermined that  Scott Homes would be a good candidate for a HOPE VI  revitalization grant\nbecause of its age, structural defects, infrastructure defects and high population density and\n5Through § 1437v(e)(2), Congress provided to the Secretary of HUD the authority to\nestablish selection  criteria for the award of HOPE VI Grants.  \n5\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 391    Entered on FLSD Docket 11/10/2009   Page 6 of 42\naccordingly submitted its  first  application for  HOPE VI funding in 1996.     \nFollowing HUD’s rejection of its 1996 application, County defendants met with Bob\nPrescott, a Deputy to the HUD Director of the HOPE VI program, who debriefed the County on the\nreasons for the failure of its application. Prescott advised that the 1996  application  was unsuccessful\nbecause it would result  in a project that was “still almost 100% single head of households, non-\nworking, mostly AFDC, 97% African-American, a homogenous concentration of like families.”\n[DE# 355, Ex. 5, DE# 200, pp. 33-37].  Prescott also expressed  concern over the “lesser amount of\ndemolition and not changing the tenant body... there was not that dramatic  a change either physically\nor socially.”  The County sought to address these concerns in new  HOPE VI grant applications\nsubmitted in 1997 and 1998, but  these applications, too, were  unfunded.   \nOn February 26, 1999, HUD issued a “Super Notice of Funding Availability” (“Super\nNOFA”) announcing the availability of approximately $523 million in HOPE VI revitalization funds.\nThe Super NOFA identified the following qualifying criteria for successful applicants:\n(a)  The  proposal must  be designed  to lessen the concentration of low income households,\ncreate opportunities  for desegregation, and offer viable housing choices in the design of the new\ndevelopment;  \n(b)  The  proposal must affirmatively further fair housing and encourage diversity by physical\ndesign of the revitalized units; location of the new units, and marketing of housing types; \n  (c) The applicant  must certify that it has  matching funds, which could be combined with\nHUD funds to carry out the revitalization efforts;\n(d) The applicant must comply with requirements of the Uniform Relocation and Real\nProperty Acquisition Act.\n6\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 391    Entered on FLSD Docket 11/10/2009   Page 7 of 42\nHUD’s 1999 Super NOFA included a section explaining the five  “rating factors” used to\nreview and score  HOPE VI grant applications:  \n(1)  Capacity (20 possible points)\n(2)  Need (20 possible points)\n(3)  Soundness of Approach (40 possible points)\n(4)  Leveraging Resources (10 possible points) and\n(5)  Comprehensiveness and Coordination (10 possible points).   \nEach rating factor is subdivided into  a number of subfactors, and each subfactor is assigned\na maximum point total.  Of particular relevance here,  under  the third rating factor, “soundness of\napproach,” is a sub-factor entitled “affirmatively furthering fair housing” (sub-8) which provides\nfor a maximum sub-score of  five points.  To receive maximum points under  this subfactor, the\nHUD Super NOFA and corresponding  application kit explain  that  the applicant “must affirmatively\nfurther fair housing though the physical design of the revitalized units,  the location of new units, and\nmarketing of housing  that  will encourage diversity.” \nUnder a subdivision (8)(b), captioned “diversity,” HUD further advises:\nTo receive maximum points, program activities must aid a broad diversity of eligible\nresidents, including the elderly, the disabled, etc.  HUD will also evaluate your\nefforts to increase community awareness in a culturally sensitive manner through\neducation  and  outreach,  as  applicable.  Describe  specific  steps  to  address  the\nelimination of impediments to fair housing that were identified  in your jurisdiction’s\nAnalysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice,  remedy discrimination in housing,\nor promote fair housing rights and fair housing choice.  Your marketing and outreach\nactivities should be targeted to all segments of the population on a nondiscriminatory\nbasis, promote housing choice and opportunity throughout your jurisdiction, and\ncontribute to the deconcentration of minority and low income neighborhoods.\n[DE# 352-4, p. 34]\n7\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 391    Entered on FLSD Docket 11/10/2009   Page 8 of 42\nRating factor number 3, “soundness of approach,” also includes  a sub-factor entitled “lessen\nconcentration,” allowing for a nine point maximum sub-score.  To receive maximum points under\nthis subfactor, the applicant’s revitalization plan  “must reduce the isolation of  low -income\nresidents, create opportunities for desegregation, and offer viable housing choices.” [DE# 352-4, p.\n27].   This subfactor  factor is further divided  into  two additional  components - “physical plan and\ndesign” (6 possible points) and  “Section 8\" (3 possible points).   \nUnder  “Physical Plan and Design,” [¶ (3)(a)],  HUD’s 1999 Super NOFA  explains in\npertinent part that maximum points are available to the applicant showing  that :\n(i) The physical plan and design of the proposed on site housing will significantly\nreduce the isolation of low income residents and/or significantly promote mixed\nincome communities in well  functioning neighborhoods.\n(ii) Any plans for off site housing will lessen concentration of low income residents\nand create opportunities for desegregation by activity ensuring that locations of\nhousing will not be in neighborhoods  with high levels of poverty and/or high\nconcentrations of minorities.  (You do not have to have selected the precise location\nof  site units in your application to receive full points for this element)\nAccording to the unrebutted  affidavit of  Susan Wilson, Director of HUD’s Office of Urban\nRevitalization,6  the reference to “desegregation” in the HUD Super NOFA and corresponding\nApplication Kit  “refers to the desegregation of  low income households, a congressionally mandated\npurpose of the HOPE VI program,  42 U.S.C. 1437v(a)(3),” [WILSON AFFIDAVIT, at ¶11 [DE#\n334-2],   while the “Section 8\" component of the “lessening de-concentration” factor concerns\n6  Wilson has held this post since 2006.  She was involved in  review and scoring of HOPE\nVI grant applications nationwide during fiscal years 1997-98 and 2000-2008, and was  “Team\nLeader”  at the time the subject grant was awarded to MDHA.  \n8\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 391    Entered on FLSD Docket 11/10/2009   Page 9 of 42\nprovision of relocation assistance for residents receiving  Section 8 certificates and vouchers.7 \nIn 1999,  HUD  developed a “Guidance” for evaluation of HOPE VI  applications  by the Fair\nHousing and Equal Opportunity and Public and Indian Housing Office.  This Guidance mirrors the\nlanguage of  the Super NOFA, including the advice  that “locations of offsite housing will not be in\nneighborhoods  with high levels of poverty and/or high concentrations of minorities.” [DE# 167]\nIt also encourages specific actions such as “selecting sites for replacement housing that have the\neffect of deconcentrating  minority persons...” and “reduc[ing] the existence of racially identifiable\nprojects.” [DE# 167]\nIn  May, 1999, the County submitted its fourth  HOPE VI grant application.   At that  time,\n99% of  Scott-Carver Homes residents were African-American, while African- American families\ncomprised 64% of the total households in MDHA public housing, and 20% of the general population\nin Miami-Dade County.  \nThe County’s 1999 application proposed to dramatically lessen on-site density at Scott\nCarver  by 56%, calling for  demolition of all  850 public housing units and replacement with  371\non-site units [80 public housing units, 135 public housing rent-to-own units, and 156 affordable\nhomeownership units] and 91 off-site  units of affordable  homeownership.  The  1999 Revitalization\nPlan contemplated relocation of  all  Scott -Carver Homes residents over a four year period to\nalternative housing through  Section 8  vouchers and other MDHA public housing, homeownership\n7   The  “Section 8 Voucher Program” is a portable, tenant based federal subsidy that families\nuse to rent housing in the private rental market.  It is administered through various state housing\nagencies, such as Miami-Dade Housing Agency\n9\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 391    Entered on FLSD Docket 11/10/2009   Page 10 of\n 42\nand rent- to-own programs. 8\nUnder a  section of the 1999 application captioned  “We cannot control,” the County states\nin pertinent part that  “We cannot control  HOPE  VI  requirements mandated by HUD” which\nrequire the County to “lessen the concentration of poverty,” and “discourage concentrations of\nminorities in undesirable neighborhoods.”  In this same section, the application references the\n“Adker Decree,”  a consent decree entered   by Judge Paine in Adker v United States Dept of Housing\nand Urban Development, Case No. 87-00874,  which required the County to desegregate its Section\n8 and public housing programs.\nThe County’s 1999 Revitalization Plan  included a commitment of approximately  $65\nmillion in additional  resources to complete the proposed revitalization.  Of this amount, the\nCounty’s Office of Community and Economic Development (“OCED”) committed $2 million in\nCommunity Development Block Grants (“CDBG”).\n  HUD approved the County’s 1999   HOPE  VI  application, and, on August 15, 1999,\nawarded the County a  $35 million HOPE VI grant for  revitalization of  Scott-Carver Homes.  The\naward  was based  on a point score of 96/100 on the MHDA’s  application, with nine out of nine\npossible points assigned  for the “lessening concentration” sub-factor.  According to  HUD, the\nMHDA’s proposed deconcentration of low income families was crucial to the success of its\napplication.  \n8  The County defendants predicted that 469 of the original 850 Scott Carver Homes families\nwould be forced to permanently relocate  using Section 8 vouchers , while 178 families would be\nforced to permanently relocate to other public housing projects. [DE# 167].  \nThey estimated that 44 of the original 850 would qualify to purchase one of the planned 149\nhomeownership units, where the minimum “qualifying income” for three bedroom home was\nestimated between $19,000 and $21,500 and a four bedroom between $23,596 and $24,330.  \n10\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 391    Entered on FLSD Docket 11/10/2009   Page 11 of\n 42\nShortly after the award was announced,  Scott-Carver residents complained to the Miami-\nDade Board of County Commissioners about the limited  amount of planned replacement housing.\nIn response, on  April 10, 2001, the Board adopted  Resolution  R-376-01, authorizing the transfer\nof $6 million  to the  Miami- Dade Housing Finance Authority for  the construction of one hundred\nand fifty (150)  single family homes for purchase  by public  housing residents,  with a right of first\nrefusal  to  Scott -Carver displacees.  \nOn May 8, 2001, the Board of County Commissioners adopted Resolution R- 495-01,\nauthorizing the MDHA to construct an additional 175 units of Section 8  based affordable rental\nhousing units to accommodate  Scott Carver Homes residents displaced as a result of the HOPE VI\nProject.  \nTo  facilitate ongoing  relocation of  Scott-Carver  displacees,  the County defendants\nallowed  large, multi-generational  families to split up, with each family group offered alternative\nMHDA public housing or Section 8 vouchers.   Over 1170 families were relocated in this fashion.\nBy 2004, the Scott-Carver site was essentially vacant.  \nMeanwhile,  reconstruction at the site came to a standstill.  A 2004 internal audit ordered by\nthe County  found that only one “in -fill” home had been constructed  with funds designated by  R-\n376-01, and only seven Scott-Carver families had been granted mortgages.  \nIn 2005, the Board of County Commissioners vacated R-376-01 and transferred the\nremaining funds to the MDHA Development Corporation along with the vacant lots.  However, this\nentity also failed to move forward with construction, prompting the Board to  ultimately retrieve the\nfunds and seek return of the lots.\n11\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 391    Entered on FLSD Docket 11/10/2009   Page 12 of\n 42\nBy 2007, 846 of the original 850 Scott-Carver Homes had been demolished,9 and all residents\nrelocated.  Although the County had originally pledged  a sophisticated tracking database to follow\nand assist  displaced families,  the promised  database was never developed, and, by 2006 the County\nhad lost track of hundreds of relocated families. [DE# 17].  In response to the community outcry, the\nBoard of County Commissioners passed  Resolution R-1436-06 in 2006, promising to fund  a\ncoordinated  “public relations,” media and intergovernmental campaign to track the lost Scott-Carver\nresidents.\nCommunity organizers, such as The  Miami Workers Center, undertook their own efforts to\nfind displaced residents, and through door-to-door canvassing and billboard advertising, eventually\nfound hundreds of “lost” families,  many of whom by then were homeless, doubled up with relatives,\nor living in cars.   For a brief period, the MDHA worked with these community leaders to reintegrate\none hundred-forty  “found” families back into public housing. \nIn 2006, the Miami Dade County Inspector General did an internal audit of the MDHA\nHOPE VI  housing revitalization plan, finding gross  fiscal mismanagement and lack of oversight\nin its administration.  For example, of  the  $3,509,697.00  budgeted  for support to relocatees, it\nfound  85 cents on the dollar spent for  inadequate program administration, and 15 cents on the dollar\nfor actual program services. [DE# 335, Ex. 24, 25] Partially due to this  mismanagement of  the\nHOPE VI program, the federal government  placed  the MDHA into receivership in 2007 and\nassumed  control over its operations. \nIn  2008, the County entered into a  Master Development Agreement with a  new  developer,\nMcCormack Baron Salazar Inc.,  to complete the project.  Under the proposed  McCormack plan,\n9At the residents’ request,  four units  were  left standing for historical purposes.\n12\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 391    Entered on FLSD Docket 11/10/2009   Page 13 of\n 42\ndevised with input from former Scott-Carver residents and community groups,  the revitalized\nproject would  contain 177 traditional public housing units and 177 rental units.  The County\ndefendants’ request for approval of this revision is still   pending before HUD.\n  In December, 2008,  the Miami Dade Board of County Commissioners  passed  Resolution\nR-1416-08,  requiring the County to use its  “best efforts,”  to replace Scott-Carver  housing on a\none-for-one basis in the surrounding neighborhoods through   project-based  Section 8  vouchers that\nwould be affordable to relocated residents.  This Resolution calls for the  Mayor to identify  up to\n850  annual contribution contract equivalent units in the expanded HOPE -VI target area, with a\nright of  first refusal  to Scott- Carver displacees.   To date, however, no funds have been allocated\nfor its implementation. \nMore  than  half  of    the  County’s  $35  million  HOPE  VI  grant  for  the  Scott-Carver\nrevitalization project  is now spent, and  there is no completed construction at the site  except  for\na small section of  single family  homes (57 homes) built by  Habitat for Humanity under contract\nwith the County.  Of  these, forty-one homes have been purchased by former Scott-Carver Homes\nresidents, nine by public housing residents, three by Section 8 residents, and four by individuals\nliving within the HOPE VI target area.\nIV.  Standard of Review \nSummary  judgment  is  appropriate  where  “the  pleadings,  depositions,  answers  to\ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with  the affidavits, if any, show that there is no\ngenuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving  party is entitled  to a judgment as a matter\nof law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).   An issue is “material” if it is a legal element  of the claim under\napplicable  substantive law that may affect the resolution of the action.  Anderson v Liberty Lobby,\n13\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 391    Entered on FLSD Docket 11/10/2009   Page 14 of\n 42\nInc.,  477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L. Ed.2d 202 (1986).  An issue is “genuine” if\nthe record, taken as a whole, could lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party. Id.\n   The movant may meet this standard by presenting evidence demonstrating the absence of a\ndispute of material fact, or by showing that the nonmoving party has not presented evidence in\nsupport of an element  of its  case on which it bears the burden of proof.  Celotex Corp v Catrett, 477\nU.S. 317,  322-33, 106 S. Ct. 2548,  2552-53, 91 L. Ed.2d 265 (1986).  It is not necessary for the\nmoving party to supply affidavits or other similar materials negating the opponent’s claim.  Id.\nOnce the movant meets its initial burden of proof, the nonmovant must “go beyond the\npleadings” and by affidavit, deposition testimony, answers to interrogatories and admission,\ndesignate  “specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.”  Id. at 324, 106 S. Ct. at\n2552-53.  The nonmovant need not present evidence that would be admissible at trial, but “must do\nmore than show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.” Matsushita Elec.\nIndus. Co., Ltd. v Zenith Radio Corp.,  475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). If\nthe evidence is merely colorable, or is not significantly probative, summary judgment may be\ngranted.  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249, 106 S. Ct. 2505. \nAt the same time, credibility determinations, the weighing of evidence, and the drawing of\ninferences from the facts are the function of the jury, and therefore the evidence  of the non-movant\nis to be believed and all justifiable  inferences are to be drawn in his  favor.  Anderson, 477 U.S. at\n255, 106 S. Ct. 2505.  The nonmovant need  not be given the benefit of every inference, but only of\nevery reasonable inference.  Brown v City of Clewiston, 848 F.2d 1534, 1540 n. 12 (11th Cir. 1988).\nFinally,  the findings of  fact and conclusions of law made  at  the preliminary injunction\nstage in this case  are not binding on the Court in this subsequent summary judgment proceeding.\n14\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 391    Entered on FLSD Docket 11/10/2009   Page 15 of\n 42\nTexas v Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (19801); McArthur v Firestone, 817 F.2d 1548 (11th Cir.\n1987); ABC Charters Inc. V Bronson, 591 F. Supp. 2d 1272 (S.D. Fla. 2008). \nV.  Discussion\nThe Fair Housing Act was passed in 1968,  pursuant to Congress’  Thirteenth  Amendment\npowers, with the declaration that “[i]t is  the policy of the United States to provide, within\nconstitutional limitations,   “for  fair housing” throughout the United States. 42 U.S.C. § 3601;\nUnited States v  Starrett City Associates,  840 F.2d 1096 (2d Cir.), cert. den., 488 U.S. 946 (1988).\nThe statute bans discrimination because of  “race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or national\norigin” in connection with the sale and rental of housing and other private  real estate transactions,\nsubject to limitations imposed by the statute.  42 U. S. C. §§ 3604, 3605. \nUnder the Act,  the Secretary is required  “to administer the programs and activities relating\nto housing and urban development in a manner affirmatively  to further the policies of” the statute.\n§ 3608(e)(5).  The Secretary must study  the nature and extent of  “discriminatory  housing\npractices,” §3608(e)(1), and report annually to Congress “data on the race, color, religion, sex,\nnational origin, age, handicap and family characteristics  “of persons who participate  in, benefit\nfrom or who may benefit from HUD programs.” § 3608(e)(6).  The  Secretary  must   also confer\nwith State and local officials on  “the extent,  if any, to which housing discrimination  exists” in\nstates and localities and how  “State  or local enforcement programs might  be utilized to combat\nsuch discrimination.”  §3609. \nWhile “the Act was designed primarily to prohibit discrimination in the sale, rental,\nfinancing, or brokerage of private housing and to provide federal enforcement  procedures for\nremedying such discrimination so that members of minority races would not be condemned to\n15\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 391    Entered on FLSD Docket 11/10/2009   Page 16 of\n 42\nremain in urban ghettos in dense concentrations where employment and educational opportunities\nwere minimal,”   the Act also  requires  the Secretary of HUD  to consider  “the impact of proposed\npublic housing programs on the racial concentration in the area in which the proposed  housing is\nto be  built.”  Otero v  New York City  Housing  Authority,  484 F.2d 1122, 1133-34 (2d Cir. 1973).\nThe Act  bans practices that are motivated  by a racially discriminatory  purpose as well as\nthose that disproportionately affect  minorities.  Starrett City, 840 F.2d at 1100.  It is designed to\nensure that “no one is denied the right to live where they choose for discriminatory reasons.” Id.,\nciting Southend Neighborhood Improv. Ass’n v County of St. Clair, 743 F.2d 1207, 1210 (7th Cir.\n1984).  Overall, “Congress saw the anti-discrimination policy [embodied in the Fair Housing Act]\nas the means to effect the antisegregation-integration policy.”  Id.   \nUnder § 3608(e)(5), HUD has an obligation administer its programs and activities in a\nmanner which “affirmatively furthers” fair housing.  This affirmative obligation may subject it to\nliability in two types of situations – first, when HUD takes discriminatory action itself, such as\napproving  federal assistance  for a  public housing project without  considering its effect on the\nracial and socio-economic composition of the surrounding area, and second, when it is  aware of a\ngrantee’s discriminatory practices and makes no effort to force it into compliance with the FHA by\ncutting off existing federal financial assistance to the agency in question.  Anderson v City of\nAlpharetta, Ga., 737 F.2d 1530 (11th Cir. 1984), citing Shannon v HUD, 436 F.2d 809,  811 (3d Cir.\n1970)  and Gautreaux v Romney, 448 F.2d 731 (7th Cir. 1971).  See also  N. A.

Fair Housing Act (FHA) Claim\n(42 U.S.C. § 3604 et seq., Title VIII of Civil Rights Act of 1968)\nSection 3604(a) of the Fair Housing Act , 42 U.S.C. § 3604  et seq.,  Title VIII  of  the Civil\nRights Act of 1964,  provides that it is  unlawful “[t]o refuse to sell or rent ... or otherwise make\nunavailable or deny ... a dwelling to any person because of race ...”\nSection 3604(c) of the Fair Housing Act provides it is unlawful to “make,  print or publish\n...  any notice, statement or advertisement with regard to the sale or rental of a dwelling that indicates\nany preference, limitation or discrimination based on race ...”  \nIn order to prevail on a claim under the FHA, a plaintiff must  show “unequal treatment on\nthe basis of race that affects the availability of housing.” Jackson v Okaloosa County, Florida, 21\nF.3d 1542 (11th Cir. 1994).    Unequal treatment “based on race” in this paradigm can be established\nby showing  intentional discrimination, or discriminatory impact.

Bonasera v City of Norcross, 2009 WL 2569097 (11th Cir.\n2009)(unpub). This can be accomplished with evidence that the decision making body acted for the\nsole purpose of effecting the desires of private citizens, that racial considerations were a motivating\nfactor behind those desires, and that members of the decision making body were aware of the\nmotivations of the private citizens.  Hallmark Developers, Inc. v  Fulton County, Ga., 466 F.3d 1276\n(11th Cir. 2006). \nIn contrast, to establish a  prima facie disparate impact claim, it is sufficient for  plaintiff to\ndemonstrate that the challenged action results in, or can be predicted to result in, a disparate impact\nupon a protected class compared to the relevant population as a whole.  Bonasera v City of Norcross,\nsupra,  citing Jackson v Okaloosa County, 21 F.3d 1531 (11th Cir. 1994); Oti Kaga, Inc. v South\nDakota Housing  Development Authority,  342 F.3d 871, 883 (8th Cir. 2003).   A plaintiff can show\ndiscriminatory  effect  in two ways – first, by showing that the decision has a desgregative effect, and\nsecond, by showing that the decision  makes housing options significantly more restricted  for\nmembers of a protected group than for persons outside  that group.  Bonasera,  citing Housing\nInvestors, Inc. V City of  Clanton, Ala., 68  F. Supp. 2d 1287, 1298 (M. D. Ala. 1999).  Typically,\na disparate impact is demonstrated  by statistics.  Id.   \n         In this case,  plaintiffs allege that County defendants violated the FHA  in three ways: \n(1) the development and implementation of a housing  plan having disparate impact on African-\nAmerican families, giving rise to a denial of housing opportunities based on race inn violation of \n42 U.S.C. §3604(a)(Count 1);  (2) the implementation of housing plan intentionally designed to force\n18\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 391    Entered on FLSD Docket 11/10/2009   Page 19 of\n 42\nAfrican-American residents out of the redeveloped neighborhood, giving rise to denial of housing\nopportunities based on race in violation of  42 U.S.C. §3604(a) (Count 3), and (3) the issuance of\na statement displaying a  racial preference in violation of  42 U.S.C. §3604(c)(Count 4).\na. disparate impact claim\nIn support of their disparate impact claim, plaintiffs present statistical evidence  pertaining\nto the population displaced  by the demolition of Scott-Carver Homes and the relevant demographics\nin the  larger metropolitan community. Specifically, they show that 99% of   persons displaced from\nScott-Carver housing project are African-American, while 64% of the MHDA public housing\npopulation is African-American, and 20% of the Miami-Dade County population is African-\nAmerica. \nAssuming, for the purpose of this analysis, that the statistics  proffered establish a  prima\nfacie disparate impact case, see e.g. Charleston Housing Authority v United States Dept. of\nAgriculture,  419  F.3d 729 (8th Cir. 2005)(prima facie disparate impact case established where\nundisputed  evidence  showed  demolition  of  low  income  housing  complex  would  have\ndisproportionate impact on African-Americans, since majority of tenants in housing project  were\nAfrican- American);  United States  v  City  of  Black  Jack, Missouri,  508  F.2d 1179 (8th Cir.), cert.\nden., 422 U.S. 1042 (1975),  the court proceeds to examine the  subsequent steps of FHA  disparate\nimpact burden shifting analysis. \n  Under the second step, the MHDA must show  that its proposed action has a “manifest\nrelationship” to a legitimate,  nondiscriminatory policy objective, and that the  action is  justifiable\nbecause  it is necessary to the attainment of  that objective.  Charlestown Housing Authority v United\nStates Dept. of Agriculture, 419 F.3d 729 (8th Cir. 2005); Oti Kaga, 342 F.3d at 883.  If it  makes this\n19\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 391    Entered on FLSD Docket 11/10/2009   Page 20 of\n 42\nshowing, the burden shifts back to plaintiffs to show the existence of a viable alternative which could\nachieve that goal without the discriminatory effect.  Huntington Branch, N.A.A.C.P. v Town of\nHuntington, 844 F.2d  926 (2d Cir.), aff’d in part, 488 U.S. 15 (1988).\nThe County justifies its plan as necessary to reduce low-income housing density, while\npreserving housing opportunities for Scott-Carver residents  within the general vicinity of their home\nneighborhood.  In this sense, its objectives coincide with the  overarching federal statutory  goal of\npoverty de-concentration and development of sustainable, mixed income communities.  See  42\nU.S.C. § 1437v(a)(3)(calling for “housing that will avoid or decrease  the concentration of very low\nincome families”) and 42 U.S.C. § 1437p(d)(implementing the goal of reducing the concentration\nof low income public housing by providing that replacement housing is permitted on site  following\nthe demolition of obsolete housing “if  the number of replacement public housing units is\nsignificantly fewer than the number of units demolished”).  By thus seeking to shift the model of\npublic housing in Scott-Carver Homes  from that of densely clustered,  low-income housing to one\nof  economic integration, without isolation of the development from the rest of the community,  the\nCounty has articulated a legitimate, facially neutral objective which coincides with the goals of the\nfederal statutory scheme.  As plaintiff does not proffer any evidence suggesting that  the County’s\nproffered  objective is  a pretext  for race discrimination, the County has sustained its burden of proof\nat this stage of the analysis.  See Darst-Webbe Tenant Association v St. Louis Housing Authority,\n417 F.3d 898 (8th Cir. 2005).  Compare Charlestown Housing Authority,  supra (finding issue of\npretext where  Housing Authority  falsely  represented  the low income population density at the\nlocation in question).\nAccordingly, the burden  shifts back to  plaintiffs to show the existence of  an  available\n20\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 391    Entered on FLSD Docket 11/10/2009   Page 21 of\n 42\nalternative  which would  have a less discriminatory impact.  Here, plaintiffs urge that the County’s\nRevitalization Plan could and should be amended to accommodate their demand  for one-for-one\nreplacement  of all demolished  low income public housing rental units in or around  the surrounding\nneighborhoods of the original Scott-Carver housing project site.  As evidence  of the County’s own\nbelief that such a plan is feasible and could be implemented  without running afoul of  federal\nfunding requirements, they focus on  the Miami- Dade County Board of County Commissioner’s\n2008 Resolution calling for use of  “best efforts” in the construction of  850  new public housing\nrental units,  with a  right of first refusal proffered to former Scott-Carver residents.  \nWhile this proffer perhaps raises an issue pertaining to the feasability of the designated\nalternative,  it does not satisfy  plaintiffs’ burden of  showing examples of  viable  alternatives that\nsatisfy the County’s legitimate objective of poverty de-concentration while at the same time reducing\nthe  discriminatory impact  on African-Americans.  That is, plaintiffs do not proffer evidence of  a\nplan  that guarantees one- for- one replacement of traditional public housing units which would\nactually have a  lesser impact on  protected class members.  Without any evidence of  a reliable\nprediction of the composition of the post development population, plaintiffs fail to  raise a fact\nquestion on whether  their  proposed plan is likely to achieve a lesser discriminatory  impact than the\nCity’s plan, and hence  fail to carry their burden of proof in this  third and final phase of  FHA\ndisparate impact burden shifting analysis.  See Darst -Webbe, supra.  Thus, summary judgment is\nappropriately entered in favor of the  County defendants on this claim. \nb.  Intentional Discrimination Claim (Count 3) \nPlaintiffs alternatively seek to establish an intentional discrimination FHA claim against the\nCounty.    To  prove  intentional  discrimination,    plaintiffs  must  show  that  defendants  acted\n21\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 391    Entered on FLSD Docket 11/10/2009   Page 22 of\n 42\nintentionally or were improperly motivated in their decision to discriminate against  persons\nprotected by the FHA.  Bonasera v City of Norcross, 2009 WL 2569079 (11th Cir. 2009)(unpub.),\nciting Reese v Miami Dade County, 242 F. Supp. 2d 1292 (S. Fla. 2002).  \nPlaintiffs claim that   the  County defendants  intentionally discriminated against them by\ncreating and  implementing a race-based  redevelopment  plan  purposefully designed to prevent all\nbut a  few of the original Scott-Carver African-American residents from returning to the original  site\nand living in redeveloped units.  Their theory of liability here is based on direct evidence of\ndiscriminatory intent embodied in statements contained in  the County’s 1999  HOPE VI application,\nwhere, under items “we cannot control,” the County stated that it was required to follow a federal\nmandate from HUD to “lessen concentration of poverty” and “discourage concentration of minorities\nin undesirable neighborhoods.”  Plaintiffs also claim that the contours of the city’s revitalization plan\nwere informed by overt, race-based advice from HUD Deputy Director Bob Prescott, who advised\nthat the 1996 redevelopment proposal was rejected because  it was “still almost 100% single head\nof household, non-working, mostly AFDC, 97% African American housing consisting of like\nfamilies.”\nUpon consideration of record as a whole, the Court does not find this evidence  sufficient to\nraise a genuine question of fact on the issue of whether the County and its employees acted with\nconscious  intent  to  discourage  or  prevent  African  American  families  from  returning  to  the\nredeveloped project.  A full reading of  the record shows that the County was motivated by a desire\nto  deconcentrate  poverty,  rather  than  any  animus  toward  the  predominant  African-American\npopulation which resided  in the original  Scott- Carver Homes project.  There is no evidence of such\nillicit motive on the part of any board member, and no evidence that the board was reacting \n22\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 391    Entered on FLSD Docket 11/10/2009   Page 23 of\n 42\n to racially motivated citizen complaints targeted  against African Americans when it formulated its\nredevelopment plan. \nBecause plaintiffs do not present evidence from which a fact finder could reasonably conclude\nthe County  was motivated by race in its decision to demolish the Scott-Carver Homes and replace\nthe project  with a  mixed  income community, their intentional discrimination claim under the FHA\nnecessarily fails.  See Bonasera, supra.\nc.  Illegal Statement of Racial Preference (Count 4) \nSection 3604 (c) of the Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to “make, print or publish, or\ncause  to be made, printed or published,  any notice, statement or  advertisement, with  respect  to the\n...rental of a dwelling that indicates any preference, limitation, or discrimination based on race, color,\n...  sex  [or]  familial  status...or  an  intention  to  make  a  any  such  preference,  limitation,  or\ndiscrimination.” \nPlaintiffs claim that language in  County Defendants’ application under “We Cannot  Control”\nreferring  to  “HOPE  VI  requisites  mandated  by  HUD”  which  require  County  to  “lessen  the\nconcentration of poverty; [discourage] concentrations  of minorities in undesirable neighborhoods,”\nconstitutes such a statement of illegal preference or discrimination.\nThe predecessor judge  found this language  is not discriminatory on its face because it does\nnot indicate a preference based on race, or express an intention to discriminate or make a preference\nbased on race.  Reese v Miami -Dade County, 242 F. Supp. 2d 1292, 1302 (S.D. Fla. 2002).  This\ncourt agrees. \nThe expression of a general  intent to pursue an affirmative, integrated  fair housing plan\npursuant to a larger urban revitalization project  does not constitute a publication of a statement\n23\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 391    Entered on FLSD Docket 11/10/2009   Page 24 of\n 42\nindicating  a preference based on race, or an intention to make such a preference within the meaning\nof the FHA where, as here, the statement contains no racial quota or other provision purporting  to\nmake  race a factor in deciding who will  be permitted to purchase the redeveloped homes.  See South-\nSuburban Housing Center v Greater South Suburban Bd. of Realtors, 935 F.2d 868 (7th Cir.\n1991)(affirmative housing marketing  plan which vendor of homes imposed on real estate agent,\nincluding requirement for  advertisement of homes  in media with predominantly white circulation,\ndid not constitute publication of statement indicating a preference based on race in violation of FHA,\nwhere plan did not deter black home buyers from pursuing their interests in homes nor preclude\nagents from showing homes to black potential purchasers),  cert. den., 502 U.S. 1074 (1992). \n2. Equal Protection Claim (§ 1983) (Count 8 )\nOn their equal protection claim, asserted under 42 U.S.C. §1983, plaintiffs contend  that the\nCounty’s revitalization plan creates an express racial classification meriting  “strict scrutiny,”\nrequiring that the  classification be (1) justified by a compelling governmental interest, and (2)\nnarrowly  tailored  to  furthering  that  interest  in  order  to  pass  constitutional  muster.  Adarand\nConstructors, Inc. v Pena,  515 U.S. 227, 115 S. Ct. 2097, 132 L. Ed.2d 158  (1995). \nProof of  discriminatory purpose or intent is necessary to establish a violation of the equal\nprotection clause.  Village of Arlington Heights v Metropolitan Housing Development Corp.,  429\nU.S. 252, 264-71 (1977).  To prove discriminatory purpose in this context, it is sufficient that\nplaintiffs simply show race was  a motivating favor in the challenged decision making process.  Id.\nat 265-66. \nIn support of their equal protection  claim against the County, plaintiffs  rely heavily on the\nUnited  States Supreme Court’s  decision in Parents Involved in Community Schools v Seattle School\n24\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 391    Entered on FLSD Docket 11/10/2009   Page 25 of\n 42\nDistrict No. 1, 551 U.S. 701, 127 S. Ct. 2738, 168 L. Ed.2d 508 (2007)  and the Fifth Circuit’s\nopinion in   Walker  v City of Mesquite, 169 F.3d 973 (5th Cir. 1999), cert. den., 528 U.S. 1131 (2000)\nas illustrations of “strict  scrutiny” analysis applied to  “benign” racial classifications geared toward\nintegration. \nIn Parents Involved,   the court  applied strict scrutiny to evaluate the constitutionality of high\nschool and elementary school student assignment plans that relied on  race to determine which\nschools certain children may attend.  The school districts justified  their action  as necessary to  reduce\nracial concentrations and promote  the overarching goal of  racial diversity in elementary and\nsecondary schools.  \nThe Supreme Court noted that the student assignment plans, in  design and operation, were\nwere directed only to racial balance, and that  “racial  balancing” could not be  transformed  from\n“patently unconstitutional” to a compelling state  interest simply by re-labeling it   “racial diversity.”\nIn reaching  this  result, it distinguished its prior opinion in Grutter v Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 123\nS. Ct. 2325, 156 L. Ed.2d 304 (2003),  where it  recognized  the interest  in racial  diversity  in higher\neducation as a compelling government interest sufficient to withstand  strict scrutiny analysis.  In\nGrutter, it held that a state university law school had a compelling interest  in attaining  a diverse\nstudent body, where its admission policy was  not focused on race alone but encompassed “all factors\nthat may contribute to student  body diversity.”  That is, Grutter permitted consideration of race as\n“a factor”  in a  holistic, individualized  admission review process designed to achieve “exposure to\nwidely  diverse  people, culture, idea and  viewpoints” in the context of higher education, while the\nstudent assignment plans in Parents Involved   impermissibly used race  as  “the factor” which alone\ndetermined  student assignments for some in a non-individual, mechanical  way.   Parents Involved\n25\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 391    Entered on FLSD Docket 11/10/2009   Page 26 of\n 42\nat  723-724.    \nIn Walker, the Fifth Circuit applied strict scrutiny analysis to a district  court  remedial order\nrequiring  new public housing  to be built in “predominantly white neighborhoods,” and found the\nremedial order violated equal protection because it was not narrowly tailored to remedy vestiges of\npast discrimination and segregation within  the city’s public housing programs, given the success of\nthe city’s  Section 8 system, the availability of viable, nonracial, nondiscriminatory site selection\ncriteria, and race-neutral, good  faith efforts on part of the City and  HUD to remedy the wrongs of\nthe past. \nUnlike the student assignment plans at issue  in Parents Involved, or the remedial order in\nWalker  v  City of Mesquite, the housing redevelopment plan of the County at issue here is  facially\nrace-neutral.  It does not set racial quotas for the redeveloped housing, or establish  site selection\ncriteria  based on race.  Rather, it is simply  geared, consistent with the underlying goals of the  HOPE\nVI program, toward the  de-concentration of poverty, regardless of the racial composition of the\nresulting  populations.    See  Reese v Miami Dade County, 242 F. Supp. 1292 (S.D. Fla. 2002).\nTo the extent that  “deconcentration of minorities” is also identified as a goal of the County’s\nredevelopment plan, it is  but one factor weighed in with others aimed at pursuing the County’s \noverarching goal of   deconcentration of poverty and economic integration. \nThus,  plaintiffs’ reliance on Parents Involved,  Walker and similar “strict scrutiny” equal\nprotection  cases  is  misplaced    because  the  County’s    plan  is  not  based  on  express  racial\nclassifications,   does not   expressly  limit or prohibit  housing opportunities  based on race, and  does\nnot  require integration or desegregation based on racial compositions.  More specifically, as\napproved by HUD, the County’s plan does not require integration of  former Scott -Carver residents\n26\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 391    Entered on FLSD Docket 11/10/2009   Page 27 of\n 42\ninto “predominantly white” communities,  cf. Walker v City of Mesquite, supra, and it does not set\nracial quotas for  residents  of the redeveloped property or the neighboring communities absorbing\nthe relocated Scott Carver displacees.  Cf. United States  v Starrett City Associates, 840 F.2d 1096\n(2d Cir.1988)(racial ceilings used to prevent “white flight” and maintain current integration levels\nheld unlawful under Fair Housing Act,  where quotas caused qualified minority applicants to wait\nlonger for apartments than whites), cert. den., 488 U.S. 946 (1988); United States v Charlottesville\nRedevelopment and Housing Authority, 718 F. Supp. 461 (W.D. Va. 1989)(race conscious tenant\nselection policy in public housing project which gave preferential  treatment to white applicants to\nachieve a 50/50 mix of black and white residents held unlawful under FHA; interest in racial\nintegration alone  insufficient to justify a racial quota systems which  lessened  housing opportunities\nfor minorities). \nThe  County’s plan in this case   calls for creation of  different types of affordable housing\ngeared toward economic integration and diversity.  Rather than  create  express racial classifications\nfor   on- site or off-site housing, the plan requires  the marketing of all new, affordable housing units\non a nondiscriminatory basis to all races.  Since the County’s 1999 revitalization plan is facially\nneutral, it is subject to  strict  scrutiny review   “only  if  it can be proved   that the law was ‘motivated\nby a racial purpose or object,’ or  is unexplainable on grounds other than race.”  Hunt v Cromartie,\n526 U.S. 541, 546 , 119 S. Ct. 1545, 143 L. Ed.2d 731  (1999).  Because plaintiffs  do not  make this\nshowing,  the County’s revitalization scheme  is subject to  simple  “rational basis” equal protection\nreview.   \nIt  survives  this  minimal level of scrutiny because the County  has a legitimate governmental\ninterest  in the de-concentration of poverty and integration of impoverished families into the larger\n27\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 391    Entered on FLSD Docket 11/10/2009   Page 28 of\n 42\ncommunity, and its  proposed redevelopment plan is rationally related to advancing  those  interests.\nSee e.g.  Friends of  Lake View School  District Incorporation No. 25 of Phillips County  v Beebe, 578\nF.3d 753 (8th Cir. August 25, 2009)(applying rational basis test to facially neutral Arkansas statute\nrequiring school districts with fewer than 350 students to be annexed by another district, where statute\nclassified school districts, not persons, based on average daily membership, regardless of racial\ncomposition of student population).   See generally San Antonio Independent School Dist. v\nRodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 93 S. Ct. 1278 (1973); City of Chicago v Shalala, 189 F.3d 598 (7th Cir.\n1999)(rational basis standard of equal protection  scrutiny applied to determine constitutionality of\nprovisions of Welfare Reform Act of 1996 that disqualified non-citizens lawfully in the U.S.  from\nparticipating in various federally funded welfare programs)\nWhile plaintiffs acknowledge that a policy of  “poverty de-concentration” is  not  necessarily\nor expressly  racial, they  argue that it should be treated as such in this case, where it  is applied to an\nimpoverished  population  known  to  be  99%  African-American.      However,  a  showing  of\ndiscriminatory purpose requires “more than a mere awareness of the consequences,” it requires\nevidence of  racially discriminatory intent or purpose.   See e.g.  Friends of  Lake View School District\nIncorporation No. 25 of Phillips County  v Beebe, supra. \nWhere  there  is no evidence that the County’s original decision to revitalize Scott- Carver\nHomes was linked to the racial composition of  its residents, or  that the planned redevelopment of\nthe property was intentionally organized along racial lines,  plaintiffs fail to demonstrate the existence\nof a  genuine issue of material fact on the issue of discriminatory intent necessary to sustain their\nequal protection claim.  Summary judgment shall accordingly enter upon this claim in favor of the\nCounty defendants.\n28\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 391    Entered on FLSD Docket 11/10/2009   Page 29 of\n 42\n3.  Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Count 7) \nTitle  VI  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964  (Count  7),  42  U.S.C.  §2000d,    prohibits\ndiscrimination against  racial and ethnic minorities  in programs receiving  federal  aid.  It reaches\nonly intentional discrimination, i.e. proof of purposeful discrimination is a necessary element of a\nvalid claim under this statute.  Guardians Association v Civil Service Commission of City of New\nYork, 463 U.S. 582 (1983).  \nAs applied in  the FHA context,  this provision prohibits  intentional discrimination on the\nbasis of race in the site selection process, see e.g. B. A. S. I. C. v Kemp, 776 F. Supp. 637 (D. R.I.\n1991); Gautreaux v Chicago Housing Authority, 296 F. Supp. 907 (N.D. Ill. 1969), and eliminates\nrace-based tenant preferences.  See e.g. Otero v New York City Housing Authority, 344 F. Supp. 737\n(S.D.N.Y. 1972).\nAs discussed above,  the record in this case reveals no evidence of intentional discrimination\nin the development and implementation of the County’s revitalization plan.  Accordingly, the\nplaintiffs’ claim under § 2000d   falls  along  with the other   intentional discrimination claims. \nAnderson v Fall River Housing Authority, 2008 WL 4372820 (D. Mass. 2008)(unpub); Seabrook v\nCity of New York, 509 F. Supp. 2d 393 (S. D. N. Y. 2007). \n4.  QHWRA (Count 10) \nThe Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act (“QHWRA”) of 1998 requires public\nhousing agencies like the MHDA  to submit a plan to HUD every five years that contains, among\nother things,  the agency’s certification that its public housing plans will be administered in\nconformity with the FHA and Civil Rights Act, and  “will affirmatively further fair housing.”   See\nU.S.C. § § 1437c-1(b)(1),  § 1437c-1(d)(15).    \n29\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 391    Entered on FLSD Docket 11/10/2009   Page 30 of\n 42\nPlaintiffs’  QHWRA claim is apparently based on the premise that a violation of this statue\noccurred when the County certified to HUD that its public housing plans would be conducted and\nadministered in conformity with the FHA and Civil Rights Act, when, in reality, the County had not\nadequately considered  the racial and socio-economic effects of its planned revitalization project\npursuant to its obligation to “affirmatively further fair housing.” Plaintiffs seek  redress for this\nalleged statutory violation under the vehicle of  §1983.\nAt the outset, this court questions whether Section 1437c-1(d)(15) of QHWRA  suggests a\ncongressional  intent  to  confer  enforceable  rights  on  plaintiffs,  noting  there  has  been  some\ndisagreement in the district courts on the  issue.  Compare  Wallace v Chicago Housing Authority,\n289 F. Supp. 2d  710 (N.D. Ill. 2003) (QHWRA  certification provision  subject to private\nenforcement  under  §1983) and  Reese v Miami Dade County, supra (same) with Thomas v Butzen,\n2005 WL 2387676 (N.D. Ill. 2005)(no private cause of action for §1437c-1(d)(15) QHWRA violation\nunder § 1983).\nIn Butzen, the court rejected the notion that this provision of QHWRA creates rights\ncognizable under §1983, noting that the focus of the statute is on a public housing agency’s\nresponsibility to  report to HUD;  the statute is in the nature of a general policy statement too vague\nand amorphous to be enforced, and that  plaintiffs failed to  identify any  specific rights allegedly\nconferred by the statute as required under Blessings v Freestone, 520 U. S.  329 (1997).11   Id at *9,\n11   While there may be other statutory mechanisms available to enforce an alleged  QHWRA\nviolation,  see e.g. United States ex rel. Anti-Discrimination Center of Metro New York, Inc. v\nWestchester County, New York, 495 F. Supp. 2d 375 (S.D. N . Y. 2007)(Qui tam relator stated claim\nunder False Claims Act (FCA) against County based on false certification in application  for federal\nblock grant funds, where  County certified grant would be administered in accord with Civil Rights\nand  Fair Housing Act,  when in fact it did not take race into consideration when evaluating fair\nhousing impediments and take appropriate corrective action), the existence of an implied private\ncause of action asserted through §1983 is dubious. \n30\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 391    Entered on FLSD Docket 11/10/2009   Page 31 of\n 42\nciting Gonzaga University v Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 122 S. Ct. 2268, 153 L. Ed.2d 309 (2002). \nThe court need not definitively resolve this question here, because, even assuming the\nexistence of an implied  cause of  action, there is no support for plaintiffs’ underlying assertion that\nthe MHDA’s obligation to “affirmatively further fair housing” pursuant  to this  statutory certification\nprocess necessarily includes a duty to conduct racial and socio- economic studies in the course of\nurban redevelopment.  Even if it did, as the predecessor judge  concluded, the  the County satisfied\nthat obligation here  by retaining Goodkin Consulting to perform an economic feasability study which\nit included in its  1999 HOPE VI application package. See Reese v Miami Dade County, 242 F. Supp.\n1292, 1305 (S.D. Fla. 2002).\n  5.  HCDA Claim \n42 U.S.C.§ 5304(d)(2) (Counts 11 &12)\nThe  Housing and Community Development Act (“HCDA”), 42 U.S.C. § 5304(d)(2), requires,\nin  the event of a residential displacement associated with a  development project assisted with CDBG\nfunds, that:  \nGovernmental  agencies  or  private  developers  shall  provide  within  the  same\ncommunity comparable replacement dwellings for the same number of occupants as\ncould have been housed in the occupied and vacant occupiable low and moderate\nincome dwelling units demolished or converted to a use other than for housing for low\nand moderate income persons, and provide that such replacement housing  may\ninclude existing housing assisted with project based assistance provided under section\n1437f of this title.\n42 U.S.C. § 5304(d)(2)(A)(i).  \nPlaintiffs assert that the  County’s  revitalization plan is a project assisted with CDBG funds\nbecause the County committed, as part of its matching funds, $2 million dollars  in CDBG funds\n(federal funds allocated to the County by HUD).  Plaintiffs charge  that the County defendants are\naccordingly obligated under § 5304(d)(2)  to create one-for-one replacement dwellings as part of \n31\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 391    Entered on FLSD Docket 11/10/2009   Page 32 of\n 42\nits revitalization plan. \nAt the outset, this court  questions whether the HCDA  creates an implied private cause of\naction enforceable against the County under  §1983.    See Price v City of Stockton, 390 F.3d 1105\n(9th Cir. 2004)(finding private cause of action under Section 104(d)(2)(A)(iii) and (iv), but no private\ncause of action under 104(d)(2)(A)(i) or (ii), noting that requirements of latter are directed to\ngovernmental agencies and private developers and are phrased in aggregate terms, without reference\nto individual displaced persons).\nEven assuming a private cause of action might be implied,  the claim does not survive\nsummary judgment in this case, where  the premise of plaintiffs’  suit is  inconsistent with the\nCongressional goal of reducing density in public housing complexes and the related elimination of\none- for- one replacement requirements for HOPE  VI funded projects.  See Darst Webbe Tenant\nAss’n Bd, 339 F.3d 702,  714 (5th Cir. 2003) (enforcing one- for- one replacement would  run contrary\nto Congressional goal of decreasing density of public housing complexes);   Reese v Miami Dade\nCounty, supra.\nB.    Federal Defendants \n1. Threshold Jurisdictional Challenges\na.  Sovereign Immunity\nPlaintiffs seek to enforce their statutory claims against the federal defendants  under the\nAdministrative Procedures Act,  5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq.  Section 702 of the Act provides a limited\nwaiver of  the  federal government’s sovereign immunity for claims challenging certain agency action,\nbut this waiver is limited by Section 704,  which provides  that a  federal court may only review\nagency action “made reviewable by statute and final agency action for which there is no other\nadequate remedy in a court.” 5 U.S.C. § 704. \n32\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 391    Entered on FLSD Docket 11/10/2009   Page 33 of\n 42\nThe federal defendants contend, first,  that the APA does not effect  a waiver of sovereign\nimmunity on any of claims asserted against them  because plaintiffs have an adequate remedy for\nthese alleged  wrongs against the County.  See  Cannon v University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677 (1979);\nADAPT v HUD, 170 F.3d 381 (3d Cir. 1999)(generalized challenge to HUD action based on alleged\nfailure to undertake  any enforcement and oversight activity not subject to APA review;  plaintiffs\ncould pursue their claims of housing discrimination directly against federal funding recipients”).\nHowever,  this  is not  a  general  “negligent oversight” or “negligent enforcement” case;\nrather,  plaintiffs challenge a specific decision of HUD to approve and fund a particular County’s\nplan. This court  has  jurisdiction under the  APA to review this level of HUD decision making.\nAnderson v Jackson, 556 F.3d 351 (5th Cir. 2009)(jurisdiction to review HUD Secretary decision to\npermit demolition of public housing);  NAACP v HUD, 817 F.2d 149 (1st Cir. 1987)( jurisdiction  to\nreview HUD action where plaintiffs “pointed to a pattern of specific grant decisions by HUD”).  \nb.  Discretionary Act Exception  \nIn Count 13, plaintiffs claim that HUD violated the Housing Community and Development\nAct ( HCDA) when it approved the County’s plan without enforcing  the HCDA’s alleged one for one\nreplacement requirement.\nThe federal defendants contend the APA’s limited waiver  of sovereign immunity does not\nallow this  claim because it effectively seeks review of an enforcement decision which is  committed\nto agency discretion by law.   See e.g. Heckler v Chaney, 470 U.S. 821 (1985)(no APA jurisdiction\nto review prisoner’s challenge to failure of  FDA to enforce possible violations of Food and Drug Act\nin use of drugs for human executions; APA does not generally provide review of passive failure to\nprosecute or enforce).\nHowever,  plaintiff’s  Complaint does not challenge HUD’s  passive decision to enforce or\n33\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 391    Entered on FLSD Docket 11/10/2009   Page 34 of\n 42\nprosecute a federal law; rather, it challenges  its decision to fund the project despite the County’s\nfailure to incorporate  one- for- one replacement housing as allegedly required under the HCDA.  The\n“discretionary acts” exception to sovereign  immunity does not apply to such a claim.   See e.g.\nCitizens to Preserve Overton Park v Volpe, 401 U.S. 402 (1971), abrogated on other grounds,\nCalifano v Saunders, 430 U.S. 99, 105 (1977)(upholding APA jurisdiction to review Secretary of\nTransportation’s approval of building of interstate highway).  See also NAACP v Secretary of HUD,\n817 F.2d 149 (1st Cir. 1987)(although HUD possesses broad discretionary powers to develop, award\nand administer its grants and to decide the degree to which they can be shaped to help achieve Title\nVII goals,  HUD’s affirmative  duty to  further fair housing under the FHA is not committed to agency\ndiscretion and is reviewable under the APA).\nc.  Mootness\nFederal defendants alternatively claim that all  claims for injunctive relief are  moot at this\njuncture because  the demolition of Scott- Carver Homes and relocation of its  original tenant base\nis now complete.\n  The current  complaint seeks  affirmative injunctive relief concerning the development and\nparticulars of the County’s  replacement housing plan.   This segment of plaintiffs’ demand for\ninjunctive relief is not mooted by the demolition and interim  relocation of the original Scott- Carver\nHome  residents.\nIn addition, the County  has  proposed a revision to its revitalization plan which is still\npending before HUD for approval.   With the implementation of the original plan at a virtual\nstandstill, and a   proposed  revision pending for approval before HUD,  the mootness challenge to\nplaintiffs’ complaint for  injunctive relief is without merit.   See Coliseum Square Ass’n v Jackson,\n465 F.3d 215 (5th Cir. 2006).\n34\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 391    Entered on FLSD Docket 11/10/2009   Page 35 of\n 42\nd.  Standing \nFederal defendants contend that plaintiffs lack standing to bring these  claims because the\nrequested injunctive relief seeking   replacement of  demolished public housing units on  a one- for-\none basis   would violate Congress’ express mandate regarding replacement housing and undermine\nthe  statutory goal  of “providing housing that will avoid or decrease the concentration of very low\nincome families.   42 U.S.C. § 1437v(a)(3).    This argument is dismissed  summarily  because  the\nmerit  of  plaintiffs’ statutory challenges does not defeat their standing to assert the claims as parties\nallegedly injured by the relevant conduct of the defendants. \nWith each of the federal government’s  threshold jurisdictional challenges   rejected, the\ncourt’s inquiry turns to the substantive challenge to  each of the claims asserted against the Federal\ndefendants.     \n2.  Intentional Discrimination Claims (Counts 6, 9): \n  [Purposeful  Use of Race Based Criteria in Approving/Funding 1999 Plan]\nPlaintiffs claim that HUD violated the FHA guarantee of  fair housing (Count 6)  and the\nFifth  Amendment  equal  protection  clause  (Count  9)    by  intentional  discrimination,  i.e.  by\npurposefully  using race-based criteria in approving and funding the MDHA’s 1999 Revitalization\nPlan.\nAs direct evidence of the alleged intentional discrimination, plaintiffs point to:  \n  (1) HUD’s approval and funding of  a HOPE VI application purposefully designed to achieve\n“deconcentration of minorities” and \n(2) HUD’s encouragement and knowledge of the MDHA’s improper motivation of racial\ndeconcentration/integration.\nIn support of  this claim,  plaintiffs again emphasize the   statement in the County’s 1999\n35\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 391    Entered on FLSD Docket 11/10/2009   Page 36 of\n 42\nHOPE VI application regarding its obligation under HUD requirements and the Adker decree to\n“discourag[e] concentrations of minorities  in undesirable neighborhoods,” and a similar statement\nin  the  County’s  promotional community educational materials which identify  a “winning\napplication” as one which is designed to “discourag[e] concentration of minorities.”  Plaintiffs\ncontend that these statements  were directly encouraged and solicited by HUD, which, in  its own\nscoring system,  included a  scoring criteria  entitled  “lessen concentration” which awarded points\nfor development of a  “physical plan” that  reduced  concentration of low income residents on site,\nand ensured that off site housing avoid neighborhoods with “high concentrations of minorities.”12\nThey also cite the testimony of Robert Levis, co-author of the County’s 1999 HOPE VI  grant\nproposal, who testified that he understood the HOPE VI program imposed an  obligation to\n“affirmatively furthering fair housing” by “discouraging concentrations of minorities in undesirable\nneighborhoods,” and that he derived  this impression from the HUD NOFAs under which he labored\nin 1996, 1997 and 1998, as well as  HUD’s  “critiques” of the County’s 1996 unsuccessful\napplication.\nFurther, plaintiffs point to evidence that  federal defendants denied prior HOPE VI \napplications of the County  due to its failure to  deconcentrate  poverty and  minority populations; that\na  high  ranking  HUD staff  debriefed County officials on deficiencies of prior proposals using\nexplicit racial terms; that the 1999 Notice of Funding Availability (Super NOFA) included project\nstructuring and scoring criteria incorporating specific racial components; that County defendants\n12  Also, they point to a Scoring “Guidance” developed by HUD in 1999 for evaluation of\nHOPE VI applications by the Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) Office which reiterates\nNOFA advice that “locations of [off site] housing will not be in neighborhoods with high levels of\npoverty and/or high concentrations of minorities.”  The Guidance goes further, citing specific actions\nlike “selecting sites for replacement housing that have the effect of deconcentrating minority\npersons...” and “reduc[ing] the existence of racially identifiable projects.”   \n36\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 391    Entered on FLSD Docket 11/10/2009   Page 37 of\n 42\nprofess to have absorbed the HUD requirement of “deconcentrating minorities” from these sources;\nthat the “we cannot control” section of 1999 application evinces the County’s belief that HUD\nrequired a deconcentration of minorities; and that HUD never amended its NOFA to delete the\nreference to “deconcentration of  minorities”  and never communicated any contrary understanding\nto the  County defendants.\nThe court disagrees  with plaintiff’s assessment of these statements as creation of express\n“race based” selection criteria.  The  evidence  shows  that HUD awarded the MDHA’s HOPE VI\ngrant based on HUD’s scoring (96/100) of the County’s 1999 HOPE VI application using a multi-\nfactor,  race-neutral rating system. Under  the third point or factor, “soundness of approach,” there\nis a subfactor for “affirmatively  furthering  fair housing,” which, according to the accompanying\nApplication Kit, includes a  requirement that  applicant’s  marketing and outreach efforts “ be targeted\nto all segments of the population on a nondiscriminatory basis, promote housing choices and\nopportunity  throughout your jurisdiction, and contribute to the deconcentration of minority and low\nincome neighborhoods.” 64 Fed. Reg. 9736-37; AR 61-62.   \nThere is nothing in this subfactor or any other scoring criteria used by HUD  for reviewing\n1999  HOPE  VI  applications    which  includes  an  allocation  of    points    specifically    for\n“deconcentration of  minorities” and nothing in the scoring criteria which  includes an express  racial\npreference or other race based criteria for replacement housing.13   Instead,  scoring guidelines\npublished  by  HUD’s Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO)  regarding this\n13Although the HUD Application Kit also includes a statement indicating  that plans for off-\nsite housing should ensure that the housing will not be in “neighborhoods with high levels of poverty\nand/or high concentration of minorities,” HUD explains  that this provision does not apply in\nsituations where  the redeveloped  housing is located on the site of the existing development or in\nits surrounding neighborhood, as is the case here. There is no evidence offered to contradict this\ninterpretation.    \n37\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 391    Entered on FLSD Docket 11/10/2009   Page 38 of\n 42\nsubfactor  state that “[Housing Authorities] should include in their work plans specific  steps they will\ntake to (1) address the elimination  of impediments to fair housing choice...(2) remedy discrimination\nin housing; or (3) promote fair housing rights and fair housing choice.” Wilson Affidavit, ¶8 citing\nA.R. 426. \nIn addition,  the FHEO  review of the County’s plan concluded that “MDHA proposes to\nincrease the admission of  higher  income  families  into lower income communities while\nencouraging a more balanced mix of incomes.”  Wilson Affidavit, ¶9.  The administrative record is\nthus consistent with proposition that  the County’s  application was scored  favorably  because the\nCounty designed its  plan  to attract a  broad  socioeconomic range of potential residents.   Such an\napproach is consistent with  the  fundamental, race neutral purpose of the  HOPE VI  program, i.e.,\n to promote  “housing that will avoid or decrease the concentration of very low income families.”\n§1437v(a)(3).  Plaintiffs accordingly  fail to establish a prima facie case of intentional discrimination\nunder the FHA or  Fifth Amendment equal protection clause against the Federal defendants.   The\ncourt shall accordingly enter summary judgment in favor of the Federal defendants on each of  the\nintentional discrimination claims. \n 3.  Failure to Affirmatively Further Fair Housing  (Counts 3, 5):\nPlaintiffs also contend  that HUD failed to  affirmatively further fair housing in violation of\nthe general statutory mandate  imposed by  42 U.S.C. §3608(e).  HUD’s   obligation  to “affirmatively\nfurther fair housing” under this provision of the  FHA may subject  HUD to liability in two ways: \n(1) First, where  the department takes discriminatory action itself, such as approving federal assistance\nfor a public housing project without considering its effect on the racial and socio-economic\ncomposition of the surrounding area, and (2) Second, when the department is aware of a  grantee’s\ndiscriminatory practice and makes no effort to force it into compliance with the FHA by cutting off\n38\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 391    Entered on FLSD Docket 11/10/2009   Page 39 of\n 42\nexisting federal financial assistance to the agency in question. Anderson v City of Alpharetta, 737 F.2d\n1530 (11th Cir. 1984). \nPlaintiffs  charge that HUD violated this statutory obligation in both ways -- first, by  failing\nto adequately consider  the  racial and socioeconomic effects of the County’s  Revitalization Plan on\nprotected class members before approving the plan (Count 5), and second, by  approving  the\nCounty’s  HOPE VI application  despite its  alleged  inclusion of a discriminatory  statement of racial\npreference  (Count 6).  It seeks to enforce these statutory violations against HUD under the\nAdministrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701 et seq.  \nThis court reviews HUD’s actions for compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act  and\na general statutory mandate under a highly deferential standard, reversing only if it finds that HUD’s\nactions were  “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law.”\n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A);     Norton v Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, 542 U.S. 55, 124 S. Ct. 2373\n(2004); Darst -Webbe Tenant Association v St. Louis Housing Authority, 417 F.3d 898 (8th Cir. 2005);\nPreserve Endangered  Areas of  Cobb’s History, Inc v United  States Army Corps of Engineers, 87\nF.3d 1242 (11th Cir. 1996);  N.A.A.C.P. v Secretary  of  HUD, 817 F.2d 149 (1st Cir. 1987).  The\nreview is deferential because “it is not the role of the courts to micro-manage agency actions for\ncompliance with broad, general statutory  mandates.”  Id. at 907.   \nThis  case involves a broad,  general statutory mandate,  HUD’s  “duty  to affirmatively further\nfair housing.”  The question presented in reviewing HUD’s adherence to this policy is not whether\nHUD has in fact achieved tangible, adequate  results in the discharge of that duty; rather, it is  simply\nwhether  HUD exercised its broad authority in a manner that demonstrates consideration of, and an\neffort to achieve, such results.  Norton at 124 S. Ct. at 2380-81.  \nThe record reveals that HUD did so here, where it  considered the Goodkin study submitted\n39\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 391    Entered on FLSD Docket 11/10/2009   Page 40 of\n 42\nwith the County’s application, and based its  approval of the County’s project on an assessment of\nthe  extent to which its plan  was designed and likely to lessen concentrations of low income\nhouseholds, create mixed income communities and offer viable housing choices to the community\n(single family, apartments, rentals and homeownership) on a race -neutral basis.  See Darst-Webbe,\nsupra, 417 F.3d at 908. \nPlaintiffs  make a  separate  claim that  HUD violated  its  duty to “affirmatively  further fair\nhousing” when it approved  the application  despite the County’s inclusion of a statement of “express\nracial  preference,” apparently a reference to the  County’s reference to a  federally mandated\nobligation to   “[discourage] concentrations of minorities” pursuant to the Adker decree and HUD\nrequirements.  However,  the Court finds no statement of “express racial preference” to support the\ncharge and no other evidence evincing an abdication of HUD’s responsibility  to “affirmatively\nfurther fair housing” under the FHA.\nSection 3608(e)(5) of the FHA charges HUD with obligation to administer  its programs and\nactivities in such a way as to further the statutory goal of providing equal housing opportunities.  As\na corollary principle, HUD is  prohibited from funding any activity  that would encourage, increase\nor perpetuate racial segregation.   Anderson v City of Alpharetta, 737 F.2d 1530 , 1537 (11th Cir.\n1984)(HUD is subject to liability under the “affirmatively further” requirement only where it has\ndisbursed  federal funds to local housing authorities  who are engaged in activities that will ‘establish\nand add to segregation in housing patterns”),  quoting Garrett v Hamtramck, 503 F.2d 1236 (6th Cir.\n1974); Shannon v U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Dev., 436 F.2d 809 (3d Cir. 1970).\n           The court  previously determined that the statement in question  does not amount to unlawful\nstatement  of  “racial preference,” and with  no evidence suggesting that the MDHA’s revitalization\nplan would contribute to racial  segregation in housing patterns, there is no evidentiary basis for this\n40\n\nCase 1:01-cv-03766-DTKH   Document 391    Entered on FLSD Docket 11/10/2009   Page 41 of\n 42\nstrand of the plaintiffs’ “affirmatively further” argument. \nFinally,   the  suggestion  that   HUD’s “affirmatively further” obligation under the FHA\nincludes an obligation to ensure  a one -for- one replacement of  low income replacement rental units\nin  the planned redevelopment is without merit.  Darst- Webbe Tenant Ass’n Bd, 339 F.3d at 714.\n(enforcing one for one replacement would run contrary to Congressional goal of decreasing density\nof public housing complexes). \n4.  HCDA  (Count 13) \nFinally, plaintiffs assert  that HUD’s authorization of the relocation plan despite the Count\ndefendants’  failure  to comply with the terms of the Housing and Community Development act:\n(HCDA)  violates plaintiffs’ rights under the HCDA, 42 U.S.C. 5304(d)(1), requiring governmental\nagencies receiving a CDBG to “provide within the same community comparable replacement\ndwellings for the same number of occupants as could have ben housed in the occupied and vacant\noccupiable low and moderate income dwelling units demolished.” \nAs indicated in connection with corresponding  claim against  County defendants, this HCDA\nclaim necessarily fails because the underlying premise is false: Plaintiffs do not have a statutory right\nto one- for- one replacement of demolished  Scott Homes public housing units.  See Reese v Miami\nDade County, supra;  Darst Webbe Tenant Ass’n Bd v St. Louis Housing Authority, 339 F.3d 702, 714\n(8th Cir. 2003).\nV.
