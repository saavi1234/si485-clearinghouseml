Dauphin County has a policy or practice of strip-\nsearching all individuals who enter the Dauphin County Prison and are placed into jail clothing, \nregardless of the crim e upon which they are char ged, and has had such a policy or practice \nduring the duration of the class period proposed in this com plaint.  Upon information and belief, \nthis  policy is, in part,   derived from   the  written  procedures  of Dauphin County, and was  \npromulgated by senior Dauphin County Prison officials.   \nIt is well established in this judicial circuit that individuals charged with misdemeanors or \nsummary offenses cannot be strip-searched absent particularized reasonable suspicion that they \npossess weapons or contraband.  In  short, the policy of Dauphin  County to force those charged \n  1\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 24      Filed 11/20/2007     Page 2 of 21\nwith minor crimes to undergo the indignities  of a strip search upon entry into the Dauphin \nCounty Prison is not only clearly illegal, but is insensitive and unnecessary.  \nPlaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves, and on behalf of a class of thousands \nof others who were strip search ed after being charged with petty  crimes, to vindicate the clear \nand unnecessary violation of their civil righ ts and those of the class members they propose to \nrepresent.  Plaintiffs were all  charged with summary offenses, and all were subjected to  a strip \nsearch, in violation of their rights against unreasonable searches under the Fourth Amendment of \nthe United States Cons titution.  Plaintiffs seek monetary damages for themselves and each \nmember  of the proposed class, a declaratio n  that the D auphin  County Prison policies are \nunconstitutional, and an injunction precluding  Dauphin County from continuing to violate the \nrights of those placed into th eir custody.  With this as a background,  Plaintiffs complains as \nfollows: \nJURISDICTION \n1.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. §§ \n1331, 1341 & 1343 because it is filed to obtain com pensatory damages and injunctive relief for \nthe deprivation, under color of state law, of the ri ghts of citizens of the United States secured by \nthe Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42  U.S.C. §§ 1981 & 1983.  This Court also has \njurisdiction over this action under  the provisions of 28 U.S.C. §  2201, as it is filed to obtain \ndeclaratory relief relative to the Constitutionality of the policies of a local government. \n2.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(2) because the events givin g rise to \nPlaintiff’s claims and those of proposed class members occurred in this judicial district. \n \n  2\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 24      Filed 11/20/2007     Page 3 of 21\nPARTIES \n3.  Plaintiff Jennifer Reynolds is a citizen of the United States and resides in the State \nof Maryland.  On or about September 2, 2007,  Ms. Reynolds was arrested and placed in th e \nDauphin County Prison on charges of assem bly without a proper perm it, a violation of the \nHarrisburg City Code. \n4.  Plaintiff  Ashley McCorm ick  is a citizen   of  the  United Stat es  and resides in \nDauphin County, Pennsylvania.  On or about September 13, 2007, Ms. McCormick was arrested \nand placed in the Dauphin County Prison for failing to  pay parking tickets in the City of \nHarrisburg. \n5.  Plaintiff Herbert Carter is a citizen of the United States and resides in the State of \nMaryland.  On or about Septem ber 2, 2007, Mr. Carter was arrested and placed in the Dauphin \nCounty Prison on charges of assembly without a proper permit, a violation of the Harrisburg City \nCode. \n6.  Plaintiff Devon Sheppard is a citizen of the United States and resides in the State \nof Maryland.  On or about September 2, 2007, Ms.  Sheppard was arrested  and placed in the \nDauphin County Prison on charges of assem bly without a proper perm it, a violation of the \nHarrisburg City Code. \n7.  Defendant County of Dauphin (the “Count y”) is a county gove rnment organized \nand existing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  At all times relevant hereto, \nthe County, acting through its P rison Board of Inspectors, was responsible for the policies, \npractices, supervision, implementation and conduct of all m atters pertaining to the Dauphin \nCounty Prison and was responsible for the appointment, training, supervision and conduct of all \n  3\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 24      Filed 11/20/2007     Page 4 of 21\nDauphin County Prison.  In addition, at all rele vant times, the County was responsible for \nenforcing the rules of the Da uphin County Prison, and for ensuri ng that personnel employed in \nthe Dauphin County Prison obey the Constitution a nd laws of the United States and of t he \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n8.  Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to  Rules 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure on behalf  of himself and a class of similarly situated individuals who \nwere charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and were strip searched upon their entry into \nthe Dauphin County Prison. \n9.  The class that Plaintiff seeks to represent is defined as follows: \nAll  persons  who have been or w ill  be  placed into th e  custody of the \nDauphin County Prison after being charged with m isdemeanors, summary \noffenses, violations of probation or parole, civil comm itments, or minor \ncrimes and were or will be strip searched upon their en try into the Dauphin \nCounty Prison pursuant to the policy, custom and practice of the County of \nDauphin.  The class period commences on September 16, 2005 and extends \nto the date on which Dauphin County is enjoined from, or otherwise ceases, \nenforcing their unconstitutional policy,  practice and custom of conducting \nstrip searches absent reasonable suspic ion.  Specifically excluded from the  \nclass are Defendants and any and all of  their respective affiliates, legal \nrepresentatives, heirs, successors, employees or assignees.   \n \n10.  This action has been brought and m ay properly be maintained as a class action \nunder  Federal law an d  satisfies  the num erosity,  commonality,  typicality and adequacy \nrequirements for maintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n11.  The members of the class are so n umerous as to rende r joinder impracticable.  \nUpon  information  and belief, there are hundreds  of  people arrested for m isdemeanors  and \nviolations who are placed into the custody of the Dauphin County  Prison every month -- all of \n  4\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 24      Filed 11/20/2007     Page 5 of 21\nwhom are members of the proposed class.  Upon information and belief, the size of the proposed \nclass totals at least 7,000 indivi duals, some of whom have had their civil rights violated on  \nmultiple occasions. \n12.  Upon information and belief, joinder of a ll of these individuals is im practicable \nbecause of the large n umber of class m embers and the fact that class m embers are likely \ndispersed over a large geographical area, with  some members presently residing outside of \nDauphin County and this Judicial  District.  F urthermore, upon information and belief, m any \nmembers of the class are low-inco me persons, may not speak English, and likely would have \ngreat difficulty in pursuing their rights individually. \n13.  Common questions of law and f act exist as to all members of the Class, in that \nthey all had their right to be free from unreasonable searches violated by Defendant’s conducting \nstrip searches absent particular ized suspicion.  All m embers of the class were charged with \nmisdemeanors or violations when placed into the custody of the Dauphin County Prison, and all \nwere illegally strip searched in violation of the established law in this judicial circuit. \n14.  Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the members of the Class.  Plaintiffs \nand all members of the class sustained dam ages arising out of Defendant’s course of conduct.  \nThe harms suffered by the Plaintiff are typical of the harms suffered by the class members. \n15.  The representative Plaintiffs have the requisite personal interest in the outcome of \nthis action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class.  Plaintiffs have no \ninterests that are adverse to the interests of the members of the Class. \n16.  Plaintiffs have retained counsel who have substantial experience and success in  \nthe prosecution of class action and civil rights litigation.   \n  5\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 24      Filed 11/20/2007     Page 6 of 21\n17.  In  short, Plaintiffs’ counsel has the re sources,  expertise and experience to \nsuccessfully prosecute this action against Dauphin County.  Counsel for the Plaintiff knows of no \nconflicts among members of the class or between counsel and members of the class. \n18.  This action, in part, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.  As such, the Plaintiffs \nseek class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2 ), in that all class members were subject to \nthe same policy requiring the illegal strip searches of individuals charged with m isdemeanor or \nminor crimes and placed into the custody of the Dauphin County Prison.  In short, the County of \nDauphin has acted on grounds generally applicable to all class members. \n19.  In addition to certification unde r Rule 23(b)(2), and in th e alternative, Plaintiffs \nseek certification under Rule 23(b)(3).   \n20.  Common questions of law and  fact exist as to all members of the Class, and \npredominate  over any questions that affect on ly  individual  members  of  the Clas s.   Thes e \ncommon questions of law and fact include,  without limitation, the common and predominate \nquestion  of whether the Defendant’s written and/or  de  facto  policy  of strip searching all \nindividuals charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and committed to the Dauphin County \nPrison is a violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, \nand whether such a written and/or de facto policy existed during the class period. \n21.  A class action is superior  to other available methods  for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy, since joinder of  all of the individual m embers of the class is \nimpracticable given the large number of class members and the fact that they are dispersed over a \nlarge geographical area.  Furtherm ore, the expense and burden of individual litigation would \nmake it difficult or impossible for individual members of the class to redress the wrongs done to \n  6\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 24      Filed 11/20/2007     Page 7 of 21\nthem.  The cost to the federal court system  of adjudicating thousands of individual cases would \nbe enormous.  Individualized litigation would al so magnify the delay and expense to all parties \nand the court system.  By contrast, the conduct of  this action as a class action in this District \npresents far fewer management difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court \nsystem, and protects the rights of each member of the Class. \n22.  Upon information and belief, there are  no other actions pending to address the \nDefendants’ flagrant violation of the civil rights of thousands of individuals. \n23.  In the alternative to certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), Plaintiffs also \nseek partial certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4). \nFACTS \nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally \n24.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits government \nagencies,  such as the County  of  Dauphin and the Corrections  Officers  it supervises, from \nperforming strip searches of arrestees who have been charged with misdemeanors or other minor \ncrimes unless the officers in que stion have reasonable suspicion to believe that the arrestee is \nconcealing a weapon or contraband. \n25.  Upon information and belief, the County  of Dauphin has instituted a written \nand/or de facto policy, custom or practice of strip searching all individuals who enter the custody \nof the Dauphin County Prison and are placed into jail clothing, regardless of the nature of their \ncharged crime and without the presence of reasona ble suspicion to believe  that the individual \nwas concealing a weapon or contraband.   \n  7\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 24      Filed 11/20/2007     Page 8 of 21\n26.  The Dauphin County Prison is the local ja il used by Dauphin County to m ostly \nhouse pre-trial detainees, as well as individuals sentenced to local time.  While Dauphin County \nrefers to its local jail  as a “prison,” and this co mplaint utilizes the formal name for the facility, \n“Dauphin County Prison,” provided by the County, Dauphin County’s local jail is most certainly \nnot  comparable  to a state prison, which hous es  only sentenced detainees facing lengthy \nsentences.  \n27.  Upon information and belief, the County  of Dauphin has instituted a written \nand/or de facto policy, custom or practice of conducti ng visual body cavity  searches (visual \ninspection of the vaginal and r ectal cavities) on all individua ls who enter the custody of the \nDauphin County Prison, regardless of the individual characteristics or the nature of their charged \ncrime.  For purposes of this Complaint, strip and visual cavity searches are collectively referred \nto as “strip searches.” \n28.  The  County of Dauphin knows that it m ay  not  institute, enforce or perm it \nenforcement  of a policy or practice of conduc ting  strip searches without particularized, \nreasonable suspicion.   \n29.  The Defendants’ written and/or  de facto policy, practice and custom mandating \nwholesale  strip  searches of all m isdemeanor  and  violation arrestees ha s  been prom ulgated, \neffectuated and/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly established law. \n30.  Reasonable  suspicion to conduct a stri p  search m ay  only e manate  from  the \nparticular circumstances antecedent to the search, such as the nature of the crim e charged, the \nparticular characteristics of the arrestees, and/or the circumstances of the arrest. \n  8\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 24      Filed 11/20/2007     Page 9 of 21\n31.  Upon  information  and belief, the C ounty  of Dauphin has prom ulgated, \nimplemented, enforced, and/or faile d to rectify a written and/or  de facto policy, practice or \ncustom of strip searching  all individuals placed into the custody of the Dauphin County Prison \nand  placed into jail clothing   without any requirem ent  of r easonable  suspicion, or indeed \nsuspicion of any sort.  This written and/or  de facto policy made the strip searching of pre-trial \ndetainees routine; neither the nature of the offense charged, the characteristics of the arrestee, nor \nthe circumstances of a particular arrest were relevant to the enforcement of the policy, practice \nand custom of routine strip searches.   \n32.  The preliminary discovery taken in this matter confirms that Dauphin County has \na written and/or  de facto policy or practice of  conducting blanket strip searches.  Dauphin \nCounty has produced the “strip search for ms” for all four proposed class representatives, copies \nof which are attached hereto as Exhibit A.  Three of these forms reflect that Ashley McCormick, \nJennifer Reynolds and Herbert Carter were strip  searched because they were “held with other  \ndetainees prior to commitment,” “not searched before being br ought into prison,” and “held at \nHPD with others,” resp ectively.  The Plaintiffs maintain that these proffered justifications for \nstrip searches do not satisfy th e requirements for individualized reasonable suspicion.  The \nPlaintiffs maintain that the proffered justification to strip search Devon Shepard is illu sory as \nwell, given her criminal charges and background.     \n33.  In short, the Plaintiffs maintain that the use of the “strip search forms” is nothing \nmore than a cover for the fact th at all detainees, regardless of crim inal charge or reasonable \nsuspicion, are strip searched upon their admission to the Dauphin County Prison.   \n  9\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 24      Filed 11/20/2007     Page 10 of 21\n34.  Pursuant  to this written and/or  de  facto  policy,  each m ember  of the Class, \nincluding the named Plaintiffs, was the victim of a routine strip search upon their entry into the \nDauphin County Prison.  These searches were conducted without inquiry into or establishment of \nreasonable suspicion, and in fact were not supported by reasonable suspicion.  Strip searches are \nconducted  for individuals arrested for, am ong  other innocuous offenses, Driving W hile \nIntoxicated, Harassment, Trespassing and a range of summary offenses. \n35.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search conducted pursuant \nto this written and/or de facto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip searches -- each m ember \nof the class, including the nam ed Plaintiffs -- has suf fered or will suf fer psychological pain, \nhumiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \n \nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiffs \n36.  Plaintiffs Jennifer Reynolds, Herbert Carter and Devon Sheppard were arrested on \nSeptember 2, 2007 for a violation of the Harrisburg City Code, for allegedly assembling without \na permit.  Reynolds, Carter and Sheppard were arre sted as part of the infa mous actions of the \nHarrisburg  Police on McCorm ick  Island during  the  recent Labor Day weekend, and were \ntransported to the Dauphin County Prison when they could not pay fines that were assessed upon \nthem by a District Justice to en sure their appearance.  Reynolds, Carter and Sheppard were all \nstrip searched shortly after their admission to the Dauphin County Prison contemporaneous with \ntheir receipt of a jail uniform .  All were released from the Dauphin County Prison shortly after \ntheir admission, when their fam ily members paid the required fines nece ssary to secure their \nrelease.  \n  10\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 24      Filed 11/20/2007     Page 11 of 21\n37.  Plaintiff Ashley McCormick was arrested on September 13, 2007 for failing to \npay parking tickets issued by the City of Harrisburg, the bulk of which relate to her failure to \nmove  her car for street cleaning.  McCorm ick  was  arrested by   Magisterial  District Court \nconstables in her hom e when she was sleeping,  and she was later transported to the Dauphin \nCounty Prison in her pajamas.  Shortly after being taken to the prison, Ms. McCormick was strip \nsearched immediately prior to receiving the ja il uniform.  Ms. McCor mick was later released \nfrom the Dauphin County Prison after her family paid her fines.   \n38.  Plaintiff  Ashley McC ormick  is a  resident  of Dauphin County, and was  \nincarcerated  for not paying parking tickets.   Without suggesting that Ms. McC ormick is a  \nhabitual criminal, or, more precisely, a habitual  recipient of parking tickets, it appears that \nindividuals who fail to pay thei r parking tickets are  routinely detained at the Dauphin County \nPrison.  Consequently, there is a po ssibility beyond mere speculation that Ms. McCormick will \nbe rearrested in the future, making it likely that she will again be subjected to the  same illegal \nsearch procedure. \n39.  The arrests of all four plaintiffs were void of any reasonable suspicion to believe \nthat they harbored any weapons or contraband. \n40.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip searches conducted pursuant \nto Dauphin County’s policy, practice and custom, Plaintiffs have suffered and continue to suffer \npsychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \n \n \n  11\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 24      Filed 11/20/2007     Page 12 of 21\nCAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law  \n \n-- Unreasonable Search and Failure to Implement Municipal Policies to Avoid   \nConstitutional Deprivations, Under Color of State Law -- \n \nDemand for Declaratory Judgment and Injunctive Relief \n \n41.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation stated in \nparagraphs 1 through 40. \n42.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects citizens from \nunreasonable searches by law enforcement officers, and prohibits officers from conducting strip \nsearches  of indiv iduals  arrested  for m isdemeanors  or violations absent   some  particularized \nsuspicion that the individual in question has either contraband or weapons. \n43.  The actions of Defendant Dauphin County  detailed above violated Plaintiffs’ \nrights under the United States C onstitution.  Simply put, it was  not objectively reasonable for \nDauphin County Corrections Officers to strip search Plaintiffs and Class members based on their \narrests for misdemeanor/summary charges.   \n44.  These strip searches were conducted pursuant to the policy, custom or practice of \nthe County of Dauphin.  As such, the County of Dauphin is directly liable for the damages of the \nPlaintiffs and members of the Class. \n45.  This conduct on the part of the Defendant represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. § \n1983, given that their actions were undertaken under color of state law. \n46.  As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above,  \nPlaintiff and the members of the Class have been irreparably injured.   \n  12\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 24      Filed 11/20/2007     Page 13 of 21\n47.  The  policy, custom   and  practice of   the County of Dauphin is clearly \nunconstitutional,  in that Corrections  Officers  of the Dauphin County Prison are \ndirecting/conducting the strip searches of all individuals placed into the Dauphin County Prison \nwithout any particularized suspicion that the in dividuals in question have either contraband or \nweapons. \n48.  Upon information and belief, this policy  is currently in place at the Dauphin \nCounty Prison, with new and/or prospective m embers of the Class being subjected to the harms \nthat have already been inflicted upon the Plaintiffs.   \n49.  The continuing pattern of strip searching  individuals charged with minor crimes \nwill cause irreparable harm to the new and/or prospective m embers of the Class, an adequate \nremedy for which does not exist at law. \n50.  Plaintiffs  demand  that the County of  Dauphin  immediately  desist from   strip \nsearching  individuals placed in to  the custod y  of the Dauphin County Prison absent any \nparticularized suspicion that the individuals in question have e ither contraband or weapons, and \nseeks both a preliminary and permanent injunction from this Court ordering as much. \n51.  Plaintiffs and members of the Class also request that this Court issue a declaratory \njudgment,  and that it declare the strip sear ch  policy of the County of Dauphin to be \nunconstitutional. \n \nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY \n52.  The Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury. \n \n  13\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 24      Filed 11/20/2007     Page 14 of 21\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs Jennifer Reynolds,  Ashley McCormick, Herbert Carter and \nDevon Sheppard, on behalf of themselves and on be half of a class of others sim ilarly situated, \nrequests that this Honorable Court grant them the following relief: \n \n1.  An order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. \n2.     A  judgment  against  Defendant  County  of Dauphin awarding Compensatory \nDamages to Plaintiff and each member of the proposed class in an amount to be determined by a \nJury and/or the Court on both an individual and a class wide basis.  \n3.   A declaratory judgment declaring that the County of Dauphin’s policy, practice \nand custom of strip and visual cavity searching all detainees entering the Dauphin County Prison, \nregardless of the crime charged or suspicion of contraband, to be unconstitutional and improper.    \n4.        A preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining Defendant County of Dauphin \nfrom continuing to strip and visual cavity sear ch individuals charged with m isdemeanors or \nminor crimes absent particularized, reasonable suspicion that the arrestee subjected to the search \nis concealing weapons or other contraband. \n5.    A monetary award for attorney’s fees  and the costs of this action, pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. § 1988 and Fed. R. Civ. P. 23; \n   \n \n  14\n\nNov  20  07  05:23p  Alan  M.

The County maintains, in the absence of any discovery and prior to class \ncertification  in  this  matter,  that  they  had  reasonable  suspicion  to  strip  search  “a \nsubstantial  portion  of  [the]  proposed  class.”    (Defendants’  Brief,  p.  9).    Without \nconsidering the allegations of the Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint, which clearly state that \nall detainees admitted to the Dauphin County Jail are strip searched regardless of criminal \ncharge or individualized reasonable suspicion, (Amended Compl., ¶¶ 24-35), the County \nmakes this bold claim and provides the Court with a copy of its written strip search policy \nfor justification.  Obviously, the County’s experienced counsel is well aware that the \nCourt cannot consider matters beyond the pleadings when considering their Motion to \nDismiss, but since the County wants to proffer its policy anyway, the Plaintiffs have no \nchoice to but reciprocate.  Attached to this motion the Court will find the deposition of \nWarden Dominick DeRose, the designated deponent of Defendant Dauphin County, as \nwell  as  a  “post  order”  describing  the  job  functions  of  a  Dauphin  County \n“Booking/Receiving Officer.”  (Ex. A, Ex. B).  Warden DeRose’s transcript, and the \n“Post Order,” tell a distinctly different story that the factual recitation provided by the \nDefendant in their motion papers.   \nIn fact, Warden DeRose admits that Dauphin County illegally strip searches the \nvast  majority  of  pretrial  detainees  admitted  to  the  Dauphin  County  Jail,  and  this \nadmission lends itself in support of the Plaintiffs’ allegations – that all detainees are \nuniformly strip searched, regardless of the requirements of the County’s written policy, \ntheir criminal charge or individualized reasonable suspicion.  (DeRose, pp. 57-59, 63).  \n  1\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 45      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 4 of 17\nWarden DeRose testified that the County believes reasonable suspicion exists to strip \nsearch pre-trial detainees, including those charged with not paying traffic tickets, if they \nare commingled with other detainees prior to their arrival at the Dauphin County Prison, \nor commingled while they are awaiting admission to the facility in a series of holding \ncells on site.  (DeRose, pp. 59, 63) (discussing, at page 63, the use of a “paddy wagon” \nfor transports from the City of Harrisburg).   Three of the four class representatives were \nstrip searched on this basis.  (Amended Compl., ¶¶ 32-33, Ex. A).  These searches are \npatently illegal and unnecessary.  See, for example, Calvin v. Sheriff of Will County, 405 \nF. Supp.2d 933, 942-943 (N.D. Ill. 2005) (intermingling alone insufficient to justify \nsearch, blanket strip searches improper where “less invasive searches or other detention \npractices could obviate the need for a strip search”); Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, \n1254 (6th Cir. 1989) (“intermingling alone has never been found to justify such a search \nwithout consideration of the nature of the offense and the question of whether there is any \nreasonable  basis  for  concern  that  the  particular  detainee  will  attempt  to  introduce \nweapons or other contraband to the institution”).   \nThe “Post Order” also demonstrates that all pre-trial detainees admitted to the \nDauphin County Jail are subjected to a uniform strip search to “check for contraband \nand/or injuries … [as well as] body vermin.”  (Ex. B).  The Post Order, as well as a \nsimilar training outline also requiring blanket strip searches “after arraignment,” is still in \nuse  today  at  the  Dauphin  County  Jail.    (DeRose,  pp.  165-166).  Warden  DeRose \nconfirmed that the single largest group of individuals admitted to the Dauphin County \nJail is not felons or other hardened criminals, but individuals who could not pay their \nchild support.  (DeRose, pp. 151-52).   \n  2\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 45      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 5 of 17\nThe basis for the County’s claim for dismissal is that it can, now, supposedly \ndemonstrate a post hoc basis to strip search some members of the class based on criminal \ncharge or past criminal history, and that this effort at Monday morning quarterbacking \nshould somehow carry the day in the absence of any discovery.  The County requests the \ndismissal  of  some  nebulous,  unidentified,  and,  without  discovery,  undeterminable \npercentage of claims brought by absent class members.  This claim is premature, given \nthat no class certification motion has been filed and no discovery has been taken.  It is \nalso contrary to a range of case law, including several cases from this judicial circuit, \ndetailing that a municipality must have individualized reasonable suspicion to strip search \na detainee at the time the search is conducted, and cannot engage in an effort, after the \ninstitution of litigation, to justify strip searches post hoc.  Most importantly, this claim is \nnonsense in light of Warden DeRose’s testimony, which confirms that no effort is made \nby Dauphin County to determine a pre-trial detainee’s “past criminal history, i.e. those \ndetainees … who had a past conviction for a felony, drug or weapons” prior to their being \nillegally strip searched.  (Defendant’s Brief, p. 9; DeRose, p. 44-52).  Instead, Warden \nDeRose confirmed that the Corrections Officers conducting these illegal strip searches do \nnot have access to criminal history information.  (DeRose, p. 44-45, 49).  It is also \nnonsense in light of the “Post Order,” which requires blanked strip searches.     \nFinally,  the  Defendant  maintains  that  three  of  the  class  representatives  lack \nstanding to seek injunctive relief, concede that the fourth one does, but absurdly demand \nthat the Court engage in a complicated standing analysis now, without discovery.  Suffice \nit to say, the case authority addressing class actions brought to address the wholesale and \nwillful violation of federally protected civil rights makes clear that class representatives \n  3\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 45      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 6 of 17\nhave standing to seek injunctive relief on behalf of a prospective class even if they, \nindividually, may lack standing to do so.  This is especially true if the class representative \nseeks to challenge the official policies or practices of a municipal defendant.   \nOne Circuit Court has referred to the blanket strip and visual cavity searches at \nissue  in  this  case  as  being  “demeaning,  dehumanizing,  undignified,  humiliating, \nterrifying, unpleasant, embarrassing, repulsive, signifying degradation and submission…”  \nMary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1272 (7th Cir. 1983).  The Plaintiffs plan \nto put a stop to these illegal and degrading practices shortly, but regrettably cannot do so \nnow prior to taking appropriate discovery.  Regardless, the County’s motion seeking \n“dismissal” of this action should be denied by this Court.  \n \nARGUMENT \nPOINT I \nTHE COUNTY’S REQUEST TO DISMISS THE CLAIMS OF ABSENT CLASS \nMEMBERS IS BOTH PREMATURE AND CONTRARY TO CASE LAW FROM \nTHIS JUDICIAL CIRCUIT. \n \n  The  County  acknowledges  that  blanket  strip  search  policies/practices  are \nunconstitutional.  The Plaintiffs appreciate this concession, as the Courts of this judicial \ncircuit, and every other circuit, have held as much.  See, Newkirk v. Sheers, 834 F. Supp. \n772, 789-90 (E.D. Pa. 1993); Wood v. Hancock County Sheriff’s Department, 354 F.3d \n57, 62-63 (1st Cir. 2003); Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 801 (2d Cir. 1986); Logan v. \nShealy, 660 F.2d 1007, 1013 (4th Cir. 1981); Stewart v. Lubbock County, 767 F.2d 153, \n156-57 (5th Cir. 1985); Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1253 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, \n493 U.S. 977 (1989); Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1273; Jones v. Edwards, 770 F.2d 739, \n  4\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 45      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 7 of 17\n742 (8th Cir. 1985); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 617 (9th Cir. 1984); Chapman v. \nNichols, 989 F.2d 393, 395-96 (10th Cir. 1993); Justice v. City of Peachtree City, 961 \nF.2d 188, 193 (11th Cir. 1992).  In fact, the unanimous Federal case law on the strip \nsearches  of  pre-trial  detainees  makes  clear  that  such  searches  must  be  based  on \n“particularized  reasonable  suspicion  that  the  detainee  is  concealing  a  weapon  or \nharboring contraband or drugs.”  Newkirk, 834 F. Supp. at 791.  Several class actions \naddressing the use of illegal strip searches at local jails have been successfully prosecuted \nacross the country, including four class settlements and two additional class certifications \nachieved  by  proposed  class  counsel  in  this  action.    See,  Marriott  v.  County  of \nMontgomery,  227  F.R.D.  159  (N.D.N.Y.),  aff’d,  2005  WL  3117194  (2d  Cir.  2005) \n(certification in strip search class action litigated by co-lead counsel in this case; later \nsettled for common fund); Kahler v. County of Rensselaer, No. 03-CV-1324 (TJM/DRH), \n2005  WL  1981300  (N.D.N.Y.  August  17,  2005)  (settlement  negotiated  by  co-lead \ncounsel in this case); McDaniel v. County of Schenectady, No. 04-CV-757 (GLS/RFT) \n(N.D.N.Y. November 29, 2006) (Exhibit C) (settlement negotiated by co-lead counsel);  \nKelsey v. County of Schoharie, 2007 WL 603406 (N.D.N.Y. February 21, 2007) (class \ncertification achieved by co-lead counsel);  Mitchell v. County of Clinton, 2007 WL \n1988716 (N.D.N.Y. July 5, 2007) (class certification achieved by co-lead counsel); Hicks \nv. County of Camden, 05-CV-1857 (JHR/JS) (D.N.J. December 17, 2007) (settlement \nnegotiated by co-lead counsel in this case) (Exhibit D); Dodge v. County of Orange, 226 \nF.R.D. 177 (S.D.N.Y. 2005); McBean v. City of New York, 228 F.R.D. 487 (S.D.N.Y. \n2005); Haney v. Miami-Dade Co., No. 04-20526-CIV, 2004 WL 2203481 (S.D. Fla. \nAugust 24, 2004); Mack v. Suffolk Co., 191 F.R.D. 16 (D. Mass. 2000); Bynum v. District \n  5\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 45      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 8 of 17\nof Columbia, 384 F. Supp.2d 342 (D.D.C. 2005); Nilsen v. York Co., 400 F. Supp.2d 266 \n(D. Me. 2005) (summarizing settlements).  The U.S. District Court for the Northern \nDistrict of New York has also awarded summary judgment and a permanent injunction to \na class of individuals, like those here, who were illegally strip searched upon admission \nto a local jail.  Marriott v. County of Montgomery, 426 F. Supp.2d 1 (N.D.N.Y. 2006).   \n  The County has no basis to presently dismiss this action in its entirety given this \noverwhelming case authority; instead, it chooses to quibble over the class definition prior \nto providing the Plaintiffs with an opportunity to take discovery.  The County implicitly \nconcedes that the claims of the class representatives are perfectly appropriate, and should \nnot be dismissed.  In fact, there was no reasonable suspicion to strip search the class \nrepresentatives  at  all.    None  of  them  has  any  significant  criminal  history.    Three \nrepresentatives were strip searched for “assembling without a permit” on McCormick \nIsland in Harrisburg during the Labor Day weekend; one was strip searched for not \npaying her parking tickets.  (Amended Compl., ¶¶ 3-6, 33-34).  All but one was strip \nsearched  because  they  were  supposedly  commingled  with  other  detainees  at  the \nHarrisburg Police Department or while being detained at the Jail, in violation of their \nconstitutional rights.  (Amended Compl., Ex. A). The fourth, Devon Sheppard, a doctoral \ncandidate in biophysics at Johns Hopkins, was strip searched while menstruating because \nshe “appeared to be concealing contraband.”  She was also forced to remove her tampon \nwhile being watched by a Corrections Officer.  In short, the strip searches imposed upon \nthe class representatives “could not have been more degrading.”  Ford v. City of Boston, \n154 F. Supp.2d 131, 133 (D. Mass. 2001).   \n  6\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 45      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 9 of 17\nThe County’s main argument regarding a limitation on the class size is that they \ncan purportedly demonstrate, after the fact, a justification to strip search some members \nof the proposed class based on their criminal charges or past criminal history.  The \nCounty proposes, albeit without any clarity or specificity, that the class be reduced and/or \nthe class definition be redefined based on their claim that reasonable suspicion can be \ndemonstrated for some class members post hoc.  The County’s arguments ignore the \nPlaintiffs’ Amended Complaint, which makes clear that the County has a blanket policy, \nor, in the alternative, a blanket practice, of strip searching all detainees admitted to the \nDauphin County Jail.  They also ignore their own written policies, as reflected in a “Post \nOrder,”  that  all  detainees  should  be  strip  searched  regardless  of  their  individual \ncircumstances.  (Keach Affirmation, Exhibit B).  While the Defendant directs the Court \nto case precedent from outside this judicial circuit to indicate their right to provide post \nhoc justifications for strip searches, that case authority has been ostensibly ignored by the \nmajority of Federal courts.    \n   The burden to establish reasonable suspicion relative to certain categories of \ncrimes and/or individual pre-trial detainees lies with the Defendant.  See, Curry v. City of \nSyracuse, 316 F.3d 324, 335 (2d Cir. 2003) (probable cause is an affirmative defense, the \nburden of proof of which is on the defendant); Mack v. County of Suffolk, 191 F.R.D. 16, \n24 (D. Mass. 2000) (“given that these women were routinely strip searched, the burden \nrests  on  Defendants  to  demonstrate  that  particular  searches  were  reasonable”).  \nAssuming, arguendo, that the Court will consider the County’s written policy now (and \nthat it will ignore the Defendant’s “Post Order,” conveniently not provided in their \nmotion  submission),  and  will  accept  the  County’s  unilateral  representation  that \n  7\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 45      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 10 of 17\nmisdemeanants charged with weapons or drug offenses are uniformly searched—and \nothers  are  not—that  does  not  mandate  the  dismissal  of  this  action  in  light  of  the \nallegations of the Amended Class Action Complaint.  Another Federal court in this \njudicial circuit, in rejecting the “blanket risk” approach advocated by the County and \ndetailed in Smith v. Montgomery County, 643 F. Supp. 435 (D. Md. 1986), held as \nfollows: \n[T]his court believes that the blanket risk approach [allowing for blanket \nstrip searches for certain categories of crimes] adopted by the Smith court, \nif  it  can  ever  exculpate  a  defendant  who  conducts  a  strip  search \nnotwithstanding  the  absence  of  any  suspicion  that  the  arrestee  is \nconcealing weapons or contraband, can do so only when the jail actually \nadopted a policy that permits only those persons arrested on felonies or on \ncharges  involving  weapons  or  contraband  to  be  searched  without \nindividualized  suspicion,  and  affirmatively  requires  individualized \nsuspicion with regard to other arrestees… However, when an arrestee \ncharged with a felony or a misdemeanor involving weapons or contraband \nis  strip  searched  pursuant  to  a  policy  encompassing  all  arrestees, \nregardless of the nature of their offenses, and where it is conceded that no \nsuspicion  regarding  the  particular  arrestee  existed,  the  requisite \njustification for the search is lacking; neither the general policy nor its \nparticular application is supportable. \n \nDavis v. County of Camden, 657 F. Supp. 396, 400-401 (D.N.J. 1987).  The District of \nNew Jersey further held that an effort to demonstrate reasonable suspicion after the fact \n(as suggested in the Defendant’s motion papers) for certain arrestees was “ingenious but \nultimately flawed” when the actual practices of the municipality in question required \nblanket strip searches. Davis, 657 F. Supp. at 400.  See also, Doe v. Calumet City, 754 F. \nSupp. 1211, 1220 (N.D. Ill.  1990) (defendant must show “reasonable basis” at time of \nstrip search to demonstrate reasonable suspicion); Gonzalez v. City of Schenectady, 141 \nF.  Supp.2d  304,  309  (N.D.N.Y.  2001)  (describing  an  effort  to  establish  reasonable \nsuspicion after fact as being “absurd”); Calvin v. Sheriff of Will County, 2004 WL \n  8\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 45      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 11 of 17\n1125922, *4 (N.D. Ill. May 17, 2004) (“the ultimate legal question is not whether jail \npersonnel made erroneous reasonable suspicion determinations regarding each individual, \nbut whether the Sheriff’s policy avoided all such inquiry, thus depriving those individuals \nof their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.”).      \nHere, Dauphin County’s written policy may well require the strip searching of all \ndetainees based on certain categories of criminal charges, but that does not end the \ninquiry.  First, the Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint makes clear that, notwithstanding the \nwritten policy, the de facto practice of Dauphin County is to strip search everyone, and to \nmake up a reason for doing so.  (Amended Compl., ¶¶ 33-34).  If the Plaintiffs were able \nto demonstrate that the Defendant’s employees universally ignored the County’s written \npolicy (by, for instance, following the contradictory “Post Order”), then the blanket risk \nanalysis proposed by the Defendant would not protect the County from liability because \nthey did not employ such an analysis.  Additionally, the Defendant’s policy requires that \n“strip search forms” be generated for each detainee brought to the Dauphin County Jail.  \nShould the Defendant’s employees actually follow the written policy on strip searches, \nand are strip searching detainees charged with certain categories of crimes that supply the \nrequisite reasonable suspicion, the County will be able to demonstrate this to the Court at \nthe appropriate time after discovery is taken.  Other courts have also held, however, that \nan arrest for a drug offense, without more, does not provide reasonable suspicion to strip \nsearch.  See, Way v. County of Ventura, 445 F.3d 1157, 1161-62 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, \n127 S.Ct. 665 (2006); Dodge v. County of Orange, 209 F.R.D. 65, 76-77 (S.D.N.Y. \n2002).  Once discovery is taken, a list of relevant admission crimes is generated, and the \nstrip  search  forms  are  produced  to  the  Plaintiffs,  the  parties  can  then  address  the \n  9\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 45      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 12 of 17\ncategories of crimes proffered by the Defendants as justifying strip searches, and the \nCourt can make a ruling on these individual categories.  The Plaintiffs may even consent, \nafter taking appropriate discovery, that certain categories of crimes should be excluded \nfrom the class definition, or should be addressed relative to the Defendants’ liability by \nthe certification of subclasses. \n  That is not the proposal provided here, however.  Instead, the Defendant claims \nthat an amorphous group of class members should be excluded from the class based on a \nlist of criminal charges that they, themselves, decline to define.  This most certainly does \nnot demonstrate, unequivocally, that specific absent class members should be excluded \nfrom this litigation or have no claim, as the Defendants bear the burden in this regard.  \nRelative  to  the  County’s  claims  that  criminal  record  can  substantiate  reasonable \nsuspicion, this is undermined by the fact that Warden DeRose’s testified that a detainee’s \nprior criminal record is generally not considered at the time the detainee is searched – in \nfact, the officers conducting the searches do not even have access to computers that \nwould show a detainee’s criminal record.  (DeRose, pp. 44-45).  Also, other courts have \nnot hesitated to certify class actions that address strip searches of parole and probation \nviolators,  who  are  usually  convicted  felons,  because  these  searches  also  require \nindividualized  reasonable  suspicion.    See,  Dodge,  209  F.R.D.  at  77.      Referring  to \ncriminal record, alone, is also not a sufficient basis to establish individualized reasonable \nsuspicion,  at  least  outside  of  the  Eleventh  Circuit.    Assuming  the  propriety  of  the \nDefendant’s analysis, someone convicted of a felony as a juvenile fifty years ago could \nbe strip searched now, as a senior citizen, if they were admitted to the Dauphin County \nJail on a traffic ticket, but have otherwise led a law abiding life.  This argument should \n  10\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 45      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 13 of 17\nnot provide a basis to exclude members of the class.  At a minimum, this determination \nshould  be  made  after  discovery  is  taken.    If  someone’s  criminal  record  provided \n“particularized reasonable suspicion” to strip search them, then inevitably it will be \nreflected on their strip search form. \n  As the preceding analysis makes clear, there are a range of facts that need to be \nplumbed in discovery before determining the Defendant’s arguments on class definition.  \nConsequently, the Defendant’s arguments are premature. At this juncture, the County has \nmoved to dismiss Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint. The Plaintiffs need only show that the \nproposed class representatives have stated a cause of action. Popoola v. MD Individual \nPractice Association, 230 F.R.D. 424, 433 (D. Md. 2005). In Popoola, the District Court \nstated: \nDefendants also argue that Plaintiffs’ amended complaint does not cure \nthe defects in class definition that compelled Judge Scrivener to deny class \ncertification  for  lack  of  typicality  and  commonality.  Upon  initial \ninspection, the court disagrees, but the question of class certification is not \nproperty before the court at this time. Plaintiffs note correctly that analysis \nof class compliance with Rule 23 is not appropriately undertaken a motion \nto dismiss, but should be addressed in a motion to dismiss, but should be \naddressed in a motion pursuant to Rule 23(c)(1)(A). See7B Charles A. \nWright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure § 1798, at 226-\n27 & n. 23 (3rd ed. 2005) (citing cases). As to Defendants’ motion to \ndismiss, Plaintiffs need only show, at this juncture, that they have stated a \ncause  of  action.  (\"In  determining  the  propriety  of  a  class  action,  the \nquestion is not whether the plaintiffs have stated a cause of action or will \nprevail on the merits, but rather whether the requirements of Rule 23 have \nbeen met.\") \nId.  In fact, most courts will not decide dispositive motions prior to class certification \nbecause a decision on dispositive motions will only affect the class representative and \ndefendant involved. Res judicata will not affect absent class members. Wright v. Schock, \n742 F.2d 541, 544 (9th Cir. 1984).  \"This type of potential disadvantage to defendants has \n  11\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 45      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 14 of 17\nprompted some courts to hold that no decision on the merits of a class action can proceed \na determination of class certification.\" Id.  Thus, in accordance with the Federal Rules of \nCivil  Procedure,  Defendant’s  Motion  to  Dismiss  should  only  address  the  class \nrepresentatives’ claims.  As noted previously, the County does not, and cannot, show \nparticularized reasonable suspicion to strip search Ashley McCormick, Devon Sheppard, \nJennifer Reynolds, and Herbert Carter. \nFor these reasons, the Court should deny the Defendants’ motion to dismiss the \nclaims of absent class members and/or limit the definition of the proposed class.   \n \nPOINT II \nPLAINTIFFS REYNOLDS, CARTER AND SHEPPARD HAVE STANDING TO \nSEEK INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. \n \n  The  County  concedes  that  Plaintiff  Ashley  McCormick  has  standing  to  seek \ninjunctive relief, and, consequently, that the class’ claims for injunctive relief should \nwithstand their motion to dismiss.  No request for injunctive relief is, however, presently \npending.  Regardless, the County marches forward with an argument that some class \nrepresentatives lack standing, and propose to burden the Plaintiffs and the Court with \naddressing a complicated standing question now, in the absence of discovery, when the \nCounty’s success on this point will have no affect on the progress of this lawsuit.  A \nbetter use of time and limited resources is hard to imagine. \n  Regardless, Plaintiffs Devon Sheppard, Jennifer Reynolds and Herbert Carter do \nindeed have standing to address Dauphin County’s illegal strip search regimen. The \nsituation presented to the Court is the quintessential example of one that is capable of \nrepetition, yet avoiding review.  The United States District Court for the Eastern District \n  12\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 45      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 15 of 17\nof Pennsylvania, in considering a conditions of confinement claim at the Philadelphia \nPrison System, recently held that the named plaintiffs in that action had standing under an \nexception to the mootness doctrine which “exist[s] to address short-term harms that \nwould otherwise evade judicial review.”  Bowers v. City of Philadelphia, 2006 U.S. Dist. \nLexis 71914, * 21, 2006 WL 2818501 (E.D. Pa., September 28, 2006).  Concluding that \nthe plaintiffs do, in fact, have standing to bring the class action for injunctive and \ndeclaratory relief, the Court stated: \nGiven that Plaintiffs allege severe prison overcrowding and \ndangerous, unhealthy, and degrading conditions and given \nthat it is certain that other pretrial detainees are currently \nand  will  in  the  future  be  detained  under  the  allegedly \nunconstitutional conditions, this case certainly belongs to \nthe class of cases for which an exception to mootness must \nbe made. \n \nBowers,  2006  U.S.  Dist.  Lexis  71914,  *23-24.    Here,  the  named  Plaintiffs  seek  to \nrepresent future detainees at the Dauphin County Jail, many of whom will be illegally \nstrip searched as this motion is pending.  Other Federal courts, in the context of a class \naction, have not hesitated to find standing for injunctive relief on behalf of a class even if \nthe representative plaintiff may not, on their own, have standing to seek such relief.  See, \nBull v. City & County of San Francisco, No. C 03-01840, 2006 WL 449148, * 5 (N.D. \nCal.,  Feb.  23,  2006).    This  is  especially  true  where  a  class  representative  seeks  to \nchallenge the written policies and practices of a municipality.  See, Marriott v. County of \nMontgomery, 227 F.R.D. 159, 173 (N.D.N.Y. 2005); Mack v. Suffolk County, 191 F.R.D. \n16, 21 (D. Mass. 2000).  In short, Ms. Sheppard, Ms. Reynolds and Mr. Carter have \nstanding, as proposed class representatives, to seek injunctive relief against Dauphin \nCounty.   \n  13\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 45      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 16 of 17\n \nCONCLUSION \n  For  these  reasons,  the  Plaintiffs  respectfully  request  that  this  Court  deny \nDefendant Dauphin County’s Motion to Dismiss. \n            Respectfully submitted by: \n \nDated:  January 8, 2008      Alan M.

Vanaskie\n Thomas I. Vanaskie\n United States District Judge\n9\n\nLegal Notice\nUnited States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania\nNOTICE OF PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND HEARING\nIf You Entered The Dauphin County Prison From September 16,\n2005 To March 12, 2008 And Were Strip Searched Upon Arrival,\nThen Your Rights Could Be Affected By A Proposed Class Action\nSettlement.\nThe United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania\nauthorized this notice.  It is not from a lawyer.  You are not being sued.\no This is a proposed settlement of a class action lawsuit alleging that corrections\nofficers employed at the Dauphin County Prison engaged in the illegal strip\nsearches of all individuals charged with only misdemeanors, summary offenses,\nviolations of probation or parole or intermediate punishment, civil commitments,\nor minor offenses upon their entry into the Dauphin County Prison from\nSeptember 16, 2005 until March 12, 2008.\no The settlement would entitle each Class Member to an equalshare of a\n$2,160,500.00 million settlement fund (after payment of administrative costs, an\nincentive award to the representative plaintiff, and attorneys’ fees).  The\nmaximum payment to any Class Member shall be $1,400.00.\no If any money is left over after each claimant has received their share of the\nsettlement fund, States Self-Insured Risk Retention Group may receive some\nmoney back.  This is detailed later in this notice.\no Visit the settlement website at [INSERT] for additional details about the\nsettlement.  You may also get additional information by calling 1-800 [insert\nphone #] or by writing to [insert address].\no Your legal rights are affected whether you act or don’t act.  Read this notice\ncarefully.\nYOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND OPTIONS IN THIS SETTLEMENT:\nSubmit a Claim Form You must submit a Claim Form to receive payment\nunder the settlement. You must submit a Claim\nForm by [insert date] to receive any money.\nExclude Yourself If you exclude yourself from the settlement, you\n\nwill not be bound by the settlement or judgment\nand will not be entitled to a cash payment.  You\nwill be free to pursue your claims against the\nDefendant.  This is the only option that allows you\nto bring or be part of any other lawsuit against the\nDefendant in this case about the same legal claims\nthat are advanced in this case. You must exclude\nyourself from the settlement by [Insert Date].\nObject If you do not exclude yourself, you may write to\nthe Court about why you do not like the settlement\nor the request for legal fees and costs. You must\nsend a written objection to the Court\npostmarked no later than [Insert Date].\nGo to a Hearing You may ask to speak in Court about the fairness\nof the settlement or the request for fees and costs.\nDo Nothing You get no payment.  You give up your right to\nsue Defendant on these claims later.\no These rights and options - and the deadlines to exercise them - are explained in\nthis notice.\no The Court in charge of this case still must decide whether to give final approval to\nthe settlement.  Likewise, payments to class members will be distributed only if\nthe Court grants final approval of the settlement and after any appeals are\nresolved.\nI. WHY DID I GET THIS NOTICE PACKAGE?\nYou or someone in your family may have been charged with misdemeanors,\nsummary offenses, violations of probation or parole, civil commitments, or minor crimes,\nin Dauphin County, from September 16, 2005 to March 12, 2008 and been subject to a\nstrip search.\nThe Court sent you this notice because you have the right to know about a\nproposed settlement of a class action lawsuit, and about your options, before the Court\ndecides whether to approve the settlement.  If the Court approves it, and after any\npossible objections and appeals are resolved, an administrator appointed by the Court\nwill make the monetary payments that the settlement allows.  You will be informed of\nthe progress of the settlement.  You should understand that the process of Court approval\nmay take a good deal of time.\n2\n\nThis package explains the lawsuit, the settlement, your legal rights, what benefits\nare available, who is eligible for them and how to get them.\nThe Court in charge of this case is the United States District Court for the Middle\nDistrict of Pennsylvania, United States District Judge Thomas I. Vanaskie presiding.  The\ncase is called Reynolds, et al. v. County of Dauphin, No. 1:07-CV-01688.  The people\nwho brought suit are called the Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs sued the County of Dauphin.\nII. WHAT IS THIS LAWSUIT ABOUT?\nPlaintiffs claim in this lawsuit that the County of Dauphin illegally strip searched\nindividuals who were charged with misdemeanor crimes, violations of probation or\nparole or intermediate punishment, or other minor offenses upon their admission to the\nDauphin County Prison, in violation of the unreasonable search provisions of the United\nStates Constitution. Defendant denies that it did anything wrong, and contends that even\nif the County did do something wrong, Plaintiffs and the Class Members are not entitled\nto any money as a result of being searched.\nIII. WHY IS THIS A CLASS ACTION?\nIn a class action, one or more people, called the Class Representatives, sue on\nbehalf of all people who have similar claims.  All of these people are a Class or Class\nMembers.  A class action resolves the issues for all Class Members, except for those who\nexclude themselves from the Class.  United States District Judge Thomas Vanaskie is in\ncharge of this class action.\nIV.      WHY IS THERE A SETTLEMENT?\nThe Court did not decide in favor of Plaintiffs or Defendant.  Instead, both sides\nagreed to a settlement.  That way, they avoid the costs and risks of a trial, and the people\naffected will get compensation.  The Class Representatives and their attorneys think the\nsettlement is best for everyone who is alleged to have been illegally strip searched.\nV. HOW DO I KNOW IF I AM PART OF THE SETTLEMENT?\nAll persons who  have been or will be placed into the custody of the Dauphin County\nPrison  after  being  charged  and  arrested  within  the  County  of  Dauphin  with\nmisdemeanors, summary offenses, violations of probation or parole, civil commitments,\nor minor crimes, were or will be strip searched upon their transfer and entry into Dauphin\nCounty Prison. The class period commences on September 16, 2005 and extends until\nMarch 12, 2008. Specifically excluded from the class are Defendant and any and all of its\nrespective affiliates,legal representatives, heirs, successors, employees or assignees.\nThe settlement does not cover individuals charged with felony offenses at the\ntime of their entry into the Dauphin County Prison, anyone who entered the Dauphin\nCounty Prison after being convicted of (as compared to only being charged with) a crime,\n3\n\nor anyone who entered the Prison but was not strip searched as part of the Prison’s\nbooking procedure.\nVI.       DO I NEED TO PROVE THAT I WAS STRIP-SEARCHED, AND WHAT\nDOES THAT MEAN?\nIn filling out the Claim Form, you will affirm, under penalty of perjury, that you\nwere strip searched during the admission process at the Dauphin County Prison.  If your\nname is not contained in Dauphin County’s records, you may be asked to provide\nadditional documentation before being allowed to participate in the settlement.\nA strip search occurred if, during the admission process, you were ordered to take\noff all of your clothes by a Dauphin County employee, with that employee watching you\nundress.  Some members of the Class may also have been forced to bend at the waist or\nmanipulate body parts to allow for a visual inspection.  If you were searched in this\nmanner when you were booked into the facility, you are a member of the Class and\nentitled to make a claim.  You will need to provide an affirmation on the Claim Form\nconfirming that one of these searches was conducted on you when you entered the\nDauphin County Prison.\nVIII. HOW DO I KNOW WHETHER THE CRIME FOR WHICH I WAS\nCHARGED UPON ADMISSION TO THE DAUPHIN COUNTY PRISON\nQUALIFIES ME FOR INCLUSION IN THE CLASS?\nYou must have been brought to the Dauphin County Prison before a judge had\nsentenced you (pre-adjudication) to be eligible to recover, and the charges must have\nbeen misdemeanor or summary offenses or violation of probation, parole or intermediate\npunishment.  Everyone brought to the Dauphin County Prison pre-adjudication on\nmisdemeanor and/or summary offenses and/or violation of probation or parole or\nintermediate punishment and who was strip searched upon admission is eligible under\nthis settlement agreement.\nFinally, if you were arrested and brought to the Dauphin County Prison under\ntraffic offenses or traffic warrants, failing to pay fines and contempt, pre-adjudication,\nyou are eligible under the Settlement Agreement.  Consequently, if you failed to honor a\npayment order with a municipal court and were arrested, or failed to appear for a\nmunicipal court date and arrested, brought to the Dauphin County Prison and strip\nsearched, you are eligible to receive a settlement payment.\nIX. I WAS ADMITTED TO THE DAUPHIN COUNTY PRISON BUT I CAN’T\nREMEMBER WHAT MY CRIMINAL CHARGES WERE.  HOW CAN I\nFIND THIS OUT, AND HOW DO I KNOW IF THE CHARGE WAS A\nMISDEMEANOR OR VIOLATION?\nThere are several ways for potential class members to determine the nature of\n4\n\ntheir criminal charges.  First, you can review your charging documents, which should\nreflect both your actual charges and whether the charges were a misdemeanor offense.  If\nyou do not have your charging document and remember the local court where you were\nprosecuted, the court clerk will be able to help you find these documents.\nIf you need additional help determining whether you are a class member, or of\nyou have other questions, you can contact the Settlement Administrator at[insert\nnumber].\nYou can still make a claim if you do not remember your criminal charges if you\nbelieve you are a member of the Class, but you may be asked for additional information.\nX. I PLED GUILTY TO A CRIME.  HOW DOES THIS AFFECT MY RIGHT\nTO PARTICIPATE IN THE SETTLEMENT?\nIf you were admitted to the Dauphin County Prison solely on minor charges, as\ndefined above, you can participate in the settlement regardless of how you resolved your\ncriminal charges, including if you pled guilty to those charges.  This is provided that you\nwere admitted to the Prison before being sentenced by a court.  For most Class Members,\nthis would mean that they were committed to the Dauphin County Prison after they were\narraigned before a Judge.  If you were sentenced before admission to the Prison (meaning\nyou were committed after pleading guilty or being convicted at trial) you are not a Class\nMember.\nXI. WHAT IF I WAS ADMITTED TO THE DAUPHIN COUNTY PRISON ON\nMORE THAN ONE OCCASION DURING THE CLASS PERIOD?  CAN I\nSTILL PARTICIPATE IN THE SETTLEMENT?\nYes.  Individuals who were admitted to the Dauphin County Prison on more than\none occasion during the class period can be members of the class and can recover money.\nThey can only recover one payment, however, meaning that you will not be provided\nwith extra payments if you were admitted to the Dauphin County Prison more than one\ntime.\nXII. I AM STILL NOT SURE IF I AM INCLUDED.\nIf you are still not sure if you are included, you can ask for help.  You can call\n[insert number] and the Settlement Administrator or Class Counsel may help answer\nyour questions.  For more information, you can also visit the website, [INSERT], or you\ncan just fill out the Claim Form and return it to the Settlement Administrator to see if you\nqualify.\nTHE SETTLEMENT BENEFITS - WHAT YOU GET\n5\n\nXIII. WHAT DOES THE SETTLEMENT PROVIDE?\nStates Self-Insured Risk Retention Group has agreed to pay $2,160,500.00 to\nresolve this litigation.  That money will be used to: 1) compensate Class Members who\nhave been illegally strip searched; 2) pay for notifying Class Members and administering\nthe settlement; 3) pay incentive awards to the named Plaintiffs, Jennifer Reynolds,\nAshley McCormick and Devon Shepard; and 4) pay attorneys’ fees and expenses.  A\ncomplete description of the settlement is provided in the Settlement Agreement.  You can\nget a copy of the Settlement Agreement by visiting[enter website address] or by calling\n[enter administrator phone number].\nXIV. WHAT CAN I GET FROM THE SETTLEMENT?\nThe settlement provides that all Class Members who make claims will receive an\nequal share of $2,160,500.00, minus the costs of notice and administration, an incentive\naward for the named Plaintiffs, attorneys’ fees, and expenses, except that payments to\neach Class Members will be no more than $1,400.00.  These amounts are dependent on\nhow many claims are received by the Claims Administrator during the claims period, and\nare subject to change based on the number of claims received.  No amount is guaranteed.\nIf any money is left over after each claimant has received his or her share of the\nsettlement fund, Defendant Dauphin County will receive it.\nHOW YOU GET A PAYMENT - SUBMITTING A CLAIM FORM\nXV. HOW CAN I GET A PAYMENT?\nTo qualify for a payment, youMUST send in a Claim Form.  A claim form is\nattached to this Notice.  You can also get a claim form on the Internet at [INSERT].\nRead the instructions carefully, fill out the form, sign it, and mail it postmarked no later\nthan[insert date].\nYou may be asked for additional documents, and will be contacted in writing.\nYou may want to send in your claim form by Certified Mail, Return Receipt Requested,\nto ensure that it is received by the Settlement Administrator.\nXVI. WHEN WOULD I GET MY PAYMENT?\nThe Court will hold a hearing on Friday, October 9, 2009, to decide whether to\napprove the settlement.  If Judge Vanaskie approves the settlement, there may be appeals.\nIt is always uncertain whether those appeals can be resolved, and resolving them can take\ntime, perhaps more than a year.  Everyone who sends in a claim form will be informed of\nthe progress of the settlement.  Please be patient.\nXVII. WHAT AM I GIVING UP TO GET A PAYMENT OR STAY IN THE\n6\n\nCLASS?\nUnless you exclude yourself, you are staying in the Class, and that means you\ncan’t sue, continue to sue, or be part of any other lawsuit against Dauphin County, its\nemployees, or its elected officials about the legal issues in this case.  It also means that all\nthe Court’s orders will apply to you and legally bind you.  If you sign the claim form, you\nwill agree to release all claims that you have relating to having been strip searched.\nEXCLUDING YOURSELF FROM THE SETTLEMENT\nIf you do not want a payment from this settlement, but you want to keep the right\nto sue or continue to sue Dauphin County on your own about the legal issues in this case,\nthen you must take steps to preserve these rights.  This is called excluding yourself - or is\nsometimes referred to as “opting out” of the Settlement Class.\nXVIII.  HOW DO I GET OUT OF THE SETTLEMENT?\nTo exclude yourself from the settlement, you must send a letter by mail saying\nthat you want to be excluded from Reynolds et al. v. County of Dauphin.  Be sure to\ninclude your name, address, telephone number and your signature.  You must mail your\nexclusion request postmarked no later than [insert date] to [insert address].\nYou can’t exclude yourself on the phone or by email.  If you ask to be excluded,\nyou will not get any settlement payment, and you cannot object to the settlement.  You\nwill not be legally bound by anything that happens in this lawsuit.  You may be able to\nsue (or continue to sue) Dauphin County in the future.\nXIX. IF I DO NOT EXCLUDE MYSELF, CAN I SUE DAUPHIN COUNTY FOR\nTHE SAME THING LATER?\nNo.  Unless you exclude yourself, you give up the right to sue Dauphin County\nfor the claims that this settlement involves.  If you have a pending lawsuit, speak to your\nlawyer in that lawsuit immediately.  You must exclude yourself from this class action to\ncontinue your own lawsuit.  Remember, the exclusion deadline is [insert date].\nXX. IF I EXCLUDE MYSELF, CAN I GET MONEY FROM THE\nSETTLEMENT?\nNo.  If you exclude yourself, do not send in a claim form to ask for money.  But,\nyou may sue, continue to sue, or be part of a different lawsuit against Dauphin County.\nTHE LAWYERS AND INDIVIDUALS\n7\n\nREPRESENTING YOU\nXXI.

You can object only if you stay in the Class.  Excluding yourself is telling the\nCourt that you do not want to be a part of the class.  If you exclude yourself, you have no\nbasis to object because the case no longer legally affects you.\nTHE COURT’S FAIRNESS HEARING\nThe Court will hold a hearing to decide whether to approve the settlement.

The Court will\nlisten to people who have asked to speak at the hearing.  The Court may also decide how\nmuch to pay Class Counsel.  This hearing may be continued or rescheduled by the Court\nwithout further notice.   We do not know how long it will take the Court to give its\ndecision.\nXXVI.  DO I HAVE TO COME TO THE HEARING?\nNo.  Class Counsel will answer questions Judge Vanaskie may have.  But you are\nwelcome to come at your own expense.  If you send an objection, you do not have to\ncome to Court to talk about it.  As long as you mailed your written objection on time, the\nCourt will consider it.

If you meet the\ncriteria explained below, you can share in this settlement. \nThe United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania\nauthorized this notice.  The Court will have a hearing to decide whether to approve the\nsettlement, so that the benefits may be paid.\nWho’s Included?\nYou are a Class Member and could get benefits if (1) you were admitted into the\nDCP from September 16, 2005 through March 12, 2008, (2) you were charged with\nmisdemeanors, summary offenses, violations of probation or parole or intermediate\npunishment, civil commitments, or minor crimes, and (3) you were strip searched upon\nentry into the Correctional Facility without reasonable cause to believe that you were\nconcealing a weapon or other contraband.\nWhat’s This About?\nThe lawsuit claims that Defendant Dauphin County and its Corrections Officers\nunlawfully strip-searched everyone admitted into the DCP.  The County of Dauphin has\ndenied those claims.  The Court did not decide which side was right, but both sides\nagreed to the settlement to ensure a resolution and to provide benefits to the people who\nwere affected.\nWhat Does the Settlement Provide?\nStates Self-Insured Risk Retention Group has agreed to pay a total of\n$2,160,500.00 to settle the case.  That will pay for the claims of the Class Members, the\nadministrative costs of the settlement, an incentive award to the named plaintiffs, and the\n\nattorneys’ fees and expenses.  You can only make one claim, even if you were strip\nsearched more than once.\nEach Class Member who makes a claim will receive an equal share of the portion\nof the settlement fund allocated to pay claims to Class Members, which, after deducting\nthe other costs set forth above, shall be no more than $1,400.00.\nIf any money is left over after each claimant has received their share of the\nsettlement fund, the Defendants may receive some money back from the settlement fund.\nHow Do You Ask For A Payment?\nA detailed Notice and Claim Form package contains everything you need.  Just\ncall 1-800-XXX-XXXX or visit the settlement website, [INSERT], to get one.  To\nqualify for a payment, you must send in a Claim Form.

If you don’t want the\nsettlement benefits or don’t want to be legally bound by the settlement, you must exclude\nyourself by[insert date] 2009.  If you exclude yourself, you can’t get any benefits from\nthis settlement, but you could bring a separate case against the defendant, if you want to. \nIf you stay in the settlement, you may object to it by[insert date] 2009.

Da uphin County has a policy  of strip-searching all \nindividuals who enter the Dauphin County Prison and are placed into jail clothing, regardless of \nthe crime upon which they are charged, and has had such a policy during the duration of the class \nperiod proposed in this complaint.  Upon information and belief, this policy is, in part, derived \nfrom the written procedures of Dauphin County, and was promulgated by senior Dauphin County \nPrison officials.   \nIt is well established in this judicial circuit that individuals charged with misdemeanors or \nsummary offenses cannot be strip-searched absent particularized reasonable suspicion that they \npossess weapons or contraband.  In  short, the policy of Dauphin  County to force those charged \n  1\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 1      Filed 09/16/2007     Page 2 of 16\nwith minor crimes to undergo the indignities  of a strip search upon entry into the Dauphin \nCounty Prison is not only clearly illegal, but is insensitive and unnecessary.  \nPlaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves, and on behalf of a class of thousands \nof others who were strip search ed after being charged with petty  crimes, to vindicate the clear \nand unnecessary violation of their civil righ ts and those of the class members they propose to \nrepresent.  Plaintiffs were all  charged with summary offenses, and all were subjected to  a strip \nsearch, in violation of their rights against unreasonable searches under the Fourth Amendment of \nthe United States Cons titution.  Plaintiffs seek monetary damages for themselves and each \nmember  of the proposed class, a declaratio n  that the D auphin  County Prison policies are \nunconstitutional, and an injunction precluding  Dauphin County from continuing to violate the \nrights of those placed into th eir custody.  With this as a background,  Plaintiffs complains as \nfollows: \nJURISDICTION \n1.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. §§ \n1331, 1341 & 1343 because it is filed to obtain  compensatory damages, punitive damages, and \ninjunctive relief for the deprivation , under color of state law, of the rights of citizens of the \nUnited States secured by the Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 & 1983.  \nThis Court also has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. § 2201, as it is \nfiled  to  obtain de claratory  relief  relative  to  the  Constitutionality  of  the  policies  of  a loca l \ngovernment. \n2.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(2) because the events givin g rise to \nPlaintiff’s claims and those of proposed class members occurred in this judicial district. \n  2\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 1      Filed 09/16/2007     Page 3 of 16\nPARTIES \n3.  Plaintiff Jennifer Reynolds is a citizen of the United States and resides in the State \nof Maryland.  On or about September 2, 2007,  Ms. Reynolds was arrested and placed in th e \nDauphin County Prison on charges of assem bly without a proper perm it, a violation of the \nHarrisburg City Code. \n4.  Plaintiff  Ashley McCorm ick  is a citizen   of  the  United Stat es  and resides in \nDauphin County, Pennsylvania.  On or about September 13, 2007, Ms. McCormick was arrested \nand placed in the Dauphin County Prison for failing to  pay parking tickets in the City of \nHarrisburg. \n5.  Plaintiff Herbert Carter is a citizen of the United States and resides in the State of \nMaryland.  On or about Septem ber 2, 2007, Mr. Carter was arrested and placed in the Dauphin \nCounty Prison on charges of assembly without a proper permit, a violation of the Harrisburg City \nCode. \n6.  Plaintiff Devon Sheppard is a citizen of the United States and resides in the State \nof Maryland.  On or about September 2, 2007, Ms.  Sheppard was arrested  and placed in the \nDauphin County Prison on charges of assem bly without a proper perm it, a violation of the \nHarrisburg City Code. \n7.  Defendant County of Dauphin (the “Count y”) is a county gove rnment organized \nand existing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  At all times relevant hereto, \nthe County, acting through its P rison Board of Inspectors, was responsible for the policies, \npractices, supervision, implementation and conduct of all m atters pertaining to the Dauphin \nCounty Prison and was responsible for the appointment, training, supervision and conduct of all \n  3\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 1      Filed 09/16/2007     Page 4 of 16\nDauphin County Prison.  In addition, at all rele vant times, the County was responsible for \nenforcing the rules of the Da uphin County Prison, and for ensuri ng that personnel employed in \nthe Dauphin County Prison obey the Constitution a nd laws of the United States and of t he \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n8.  Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to  Rules 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure on behalf  of himself and a class of similarly situated individuals who \nwere charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and were strip searched upon their entry into \nthe Dauphin County Prison. \n9.  The class that Plaintiff seeks to represent is defined as follows: \nAll  persons  who have been or w ill  be  placed into th e  custody of the \nDauphin County Prison after being charged with m isdemeanors, summary \noffenses, violations of probation or parole, civil comm itments, or minor \ncrimes and were or will be strip searched upon their en try into the Dauphin \nCounty Prison pursuant to the policy, custom and practice of the County of \nDauphin.  The class period commences on September 16, 2005 and extends \nto the date on which Dauphin County is enjoined from, or otherwise ceases, \nenforcing their unconstitutional policy,  practice and custom of conducting \nstrip searches absent reasonable suspic ion.  Specifically excluded from the  \nclass are Defendants and any and all of  their respective affiliates, legal \nrepresentatives, heirs, successors, employees or assignees.   \n \n10.  This action has been brought and m ay properly be maintained as a class action \nunder  Federal law an d  satisfies  the num erosity,  commonality,  typicality and adequacy \nrequirements for maintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n11.  The members of the class are so n umerous as to rende r joinder impracticable.  \nUpon  information  and belief, there are hundreds  of  people arrested for m isdemeanors  and \nviolations who are placed into the custody of the Dauphin County  Prison every month -- all of \n  4\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 1      Filed 09/16/2007     Page 5 of 16\nwhom are members of the proposed class.  Upon information and belief, the size of the proposed \nclass totals at least 7,000 indivi duals, some of whom have had their civil rights violated on  \nmultiple occasions. \n12.  Upon information and belief, joinder of a ll of these individuals is im practicable \nbecause of the large n umber of class m embers and the fact that class m embers are likely \ndispersed over a large geographical area, with  some members presently residing outside of \nDauphin County and this Judicial  District.  F urthermore, upon information and belief, m any \nmembers of the class are low-inco me persons, may not speak English, and likely would have \ngreat difficulty in pursuing their rights individually. \n13.  Common questions of law and f act exist as to all members of the Class, in that \nthey all had their right to be free from unreasonable searches violated by Defendant’s conducting \nstrip searches absent particular ized suspicion.  All m embers of the class were charged with \nmisdemeanors or violations when placed into the custody of the Dauphin County Prison, and all \nwere illegally strip searched in violation of the established law in this judicial circuit. \n14.  Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the members of the Class.  Plaintiffs \nand all members of the class sustained dam ages arising out of Defendant’s course of conduct.  \nThe harms suffered by the Plaintiff are typical of the harms suffered by the class members. \n15.  The representative Plaintiffs have the requisite personal interest in the outcome of \nthis action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class.  Plaintiffs have no \ninterests that are adverse to the interests of the members of the Class. \n16.  Plaintiffs have retained counsel who have substantial experience and success in  \nthe prosecution of class action and civil rights litigation.   \n  5\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 1      Filed 09/16/2007     Page 6 of 16\n17.  In  short, Plaintiffs’ counsel has the re sources,  expertise and experience to \nsuccessfully prosecute this action against Dauphin County.  Counsel for the Plaintiff knows of no \nconflicts among members of the class or between counsel and members of the class. \n18.  This action, in part, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.  As such, the Plaintiffs \nseek class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2 ), in that all class members were subject to \nthe same policy requiring the illegal strip searches of individuals charged with m isdemeanor or \nminor crimes and placed into the custody of the Dauphin County Prison.  In short, the County of \nDauphin has acted on grounds generally applicable to all class members. \n19.  In addition to certification unde r Rule 23(b)(2), and in th e alternative, Plaintiffs \nseek certification under Rule 23(b)(3).   \n20.  Common questions of law and  fact exist as to all members of the Class, and \npredominate  over any questions that affect on ly  individual  members  of  the Clas s.   Thes e \ncommon questions of law and fact include,  without limitation, the common and predominate \nquestion  of whether the Defendant’s written and/or  de  facto  policy  of strip searching all \nindividuals charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and committed to the Dauphin County \nPrison is a violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, \nand whether such a written and/or de facto policy existed during the class period. \n21.  A class action is superior  to other available methods  for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy, since joinder of  all of the individual m embers of the class is \nimpracticable given the large number of class members and the fact that they are dispersed over a \nlarge geographical area.  Furtherm ore, the expense and burden of individual litigation would \nmake it difficult or impossible for individual members of the class to redress the wrongs done to \n  6\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 1      Filed 09/16/2007     Page 7 of 16\nthem.  The cost to the federal court system  of adjudicating thousands of individual cases would \nbe enormous.  Individualized litigation would al so magnify the delay and expense to all parties \nand the court system.  By contrast, the conduct of  this action as a class action in this District \npresents far fewer management difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court \nsystem, and protects the rights of each member of the Class. \n22.  Upon information and belief, there are  no other actions pending to address the \nDefendants’ flagrant violation of the civil rights of thousands of individuals. \n23.  In the alternative to certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), Plaintiffs also \nseek partial certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4). \nFACTS \nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally \n24.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits government \nagencies,  such as the County  of  Dauphin and the Corrections  Officers  it supervises, from \nperforming strip searches of arrestees who have been charged with misdemeanors or other minor \ncrimes unless the officers in que stion have reasonable suspicion to believe that the arrestee is \nconcealing a weapon or contraband. \n25.  Upon information and belief, the County  of Dauphin has instituted a written \nand/or de facto policy, custom or practice of strip searching all individuals who enter the custody \nof the Dauphin County Prison and are placed into jail clothing, regardless of the nature of their \ncharged crime and without the presence of reasona ble suspicion to believe  that the individual \nwas concealing a weapon or contraband.   \n  7\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 1      Filed 09/16/2007     Page 8 of 16\n26.  The Dauphin County Prison is the local ja il used by Dauphin County to m ostly \nhouse pre-trial detainees, as well as individuals sentenced to local time.  While Dauphin County \nrefers to its local jail  as a “prison,” and this co mplaint utilizes the formal name for the facility, \n“Dauphin County Prison,” provided by the County, Dauphin County’s local jail is most certainly \nnot  comparable  to a state prison, which hous es  only sentenced detainees facing lengthy \nsentences.  \n27.  Upon information and belief, the County  of Dauphin has instituted a written \nand/or de facto policy, custom or practice of conducti ng visual body cavity  searches (visual \ninspection of the vaginal and r ectal cavities) on all individua ls who enter the custody of the \nDauphin County Prison, regardless of the individual characteristics or the nature of their charged \ncrime.  For purposes of this Complaint, strip and visual cavity searches are collectively referred \nto as “strip searches.” \n28.  The  County of Dauphin knows that it m ay  not  institute, enforce or perm it \nenforcement  of a policy or practice of conduc ting  strip searches without particularized, \nreasonable suspicion.   \n29.  The Defendants’ written and/or  de facto policy, practice and custom mandating \nwholesale  strip  searches of all m isdemeanor  and  violation arrestees ha s  been prom ulgated, \neffectuated and/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly established law. \n30.  Reasonable  suspicion to conduct a stri p  search m ay  only e manate  from  the \nparticular circumstances antecedent to the search, such as the nature of the crim e charged, the \nparticular characteristics of the arrestees, and/or the circumstances of the arrest. \n  8\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 1      Filed 09/16/2007     Page 9 of 16\n31.  Upon  information  and belief, the C ounty  of Dauphin has prom ulgated, \nimplemented, enforced, and/or faile d to rectify a written and/or  de facto policy, practice or \ncustom of strip searching  all individuals placed into the custody of the Dauphin County Prison \nand  placed into jail clothing   without any requirem ent  of r easonable  suspicion, or indeed \nsuspicion of any sort.  This written and/or  de facto policy made the strip searching of pre-trial \ndetainees routine; neither the nature of the offense charged, the characteristics of the arrestee, nor \nthe circumstances of a particular arrest were relevant to the enforcement of the policy, practice \nand custom of routine strip searches.   \n32.  Pursuant  to this written and/or  de  facto  policy,  each m ember  of the Class, \nincluding the named Plaintiffs, was the victim of a routine strip search upon their entry into the \nDauphin County Prison.  These searches were conducted without inquiry into or establishment of \nreasonable suspicion, and in fact were not supported by reasonable suspicion.  Strip searches are \nconducted  for individuals arrested for, am ong  other innocuous offenses, Driving W hile \nIntoxicated, Harassment, Trespassing and a range of summary offenses. \n33.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search conducted pursuant \nto this written and/or de facto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip searches -- each m ember \nof the class, including the nam ed Plaintiffs -- has suf fered or will suf fer psychological pain, \nhumiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \n \nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiffs \n34.  Plaintiffs Jennifer Reynolds, Herbert Carter and Devon Sheppard were arrested on \nSeptember 2, 2007 for a violation of the Harrisburg City Code, for allegedly assembling without \n  9\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 1      Filed 09/16/2007     Page 10 of 16\na permit.  Reynolds, Carter and Sheppard were arre sted as part of the infa mous actions of the \nHarrisburg  Police on McCorm ick  Island during  the  recent Labor Day weekend, and were \ntransported to the Dauphin County Prison when they could not pay fines that were assessed upon \nthem by a District Justice to en sure their appearance.  Reynolds, Carter and Sheppard were all \nstrip searched shortly after their admission to the Dauphin County Prison contemporaneous with \ntheir receipt of a jail uniform .  All were released from the Dauphin County Prison shortly after \ntheir admission, when their fam ily members paid the required fines nece ssary to secure their \nrelease.  \n35.  Plaintiff Ashley McCormick was arrested on September 13, 2007 for failing to \npay parking tickets issued by the City of Harrisburg, the bulk of which relate to her failure to \nmove  her car for street cleaning.  McCorm ick  was  arrested by   Magisterial  District Court \nconstables in her hom e when she was sleeping,  and she was later transported to the Dauphin \nCounty Prison in her pajamas.  Shortly after being taken to the prison, Ms. McCormick was strip \nsearched immediately prior to receiving the ja il uniform.  Ms. McCor mick was later released \nfrom the Dauphin County Prison after her family paid her fines.   \n36.  The arrests of all four plaintiffs were void of any reasonable suspicion to believe \nthat they harbored any weapons or contraband. \n37.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip searches conducted pursuant \nto Dauphin County’s policy, practice and custom, Plaintiffs have suffered and continues to suffer \npsychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \n \n \n  10\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 1      Filed 09/16/2007     Page 11 of 16\nCAUSES OF ACTION \nAS AND FOR A FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law  \n \n-- Unreasonable Search and Failure to Implement Municipal Policies to Avoid \nConstitutional Deprivations, Under Color of State Law -- \n \n38.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation stated in \nparagraphs 1 through 37. \n39.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects citizens from \nunreasonable searches by law enforcement officers, and prohibits officers from conducting strip \nsearches  of indiv iduals  arrested  for m isdemeanors  or violations absent   some  particularized \nsuspicion that the individual in question has either contraband or weapons. \n40.  The actions of Defendant Dauphin County  detailed above violated Plaintiffs’ \nrights under the United States C onstitution.  Simply put, it was  not objectively reasonable for \nDauphin County Corrections Officers to strip search Plaintiffs and Class members based on their \narrests for misdemeanor/summary charges.   \n41.  These strip searches were conducted pursuant to the policy, custom or practice of \nthe County of Dauphin.  As such, the County of Dauphin is directly liable for the damages of the \nPlaintiffs and members of the Class. \n42.  This conduct on the part of the Defendant represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. § \n1983, given that their actions were undertaken under color of state law. \n43.  As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above,  \nPlaintiff and the members of the Class have been irreparably injured. \n  11\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 1      Filed 09/16/2007     Page 12 of 16\nAS AND FOR A SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n \n-- Demand for Declaratory Judgment -- \n   \n44.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation stated in \nparagraphs 1 through 43. \n45.  The  policy, custom   and  practice of   the County of Dauphin is clearly \nunconstitutional,  in that Corrections  Officers  of the Dauphin County Prison are \ndirecting/conducting the strip searches of all individuals placed into the Dauphin County Prison \nwithout any particularized suspicion that the in dividuals in question have either contraband or \nweapons. \n46.  Plaintiffs and members of the Class reque st that this Court issue a declaratory \njudgment,  and that it declare the strip sear ch  policy of the County of Dauphin to be \nunconstitutional. \nAS AND FOR A THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS  \n-- Demand for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction -- \n47.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation stated in \nparagraphs 1 through 46. \n48.  The  policy, custom   and  practice of   the County of Dauphin is clearly \nunconstitutional,  in that Corrections  Officers  of the Dauphin County Prison are \ndirecting/conducting the strip searches of all individuals placed into the Dauphin County Prison \nwithout any particularized suspicion that the in dividuals in question have either contraband or \nweapons. \n  12\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 1      Filed 09/16/2007     Page 13 of 16\n49.  Upon information and belief, this policy  is currently in place at the Dauphin \nCounty Prison, with new and/or prospective m embers of the Class being subjected to the harms \nthat have already been inflicted upon the Plaintiffs.   \n50.  The continuing pattern of strip searching  individuals charged with minor crimes \nwill cause irreparable harm to the new and/or prospective m embers of the Class, an adequate \nremedy for which does not exist at law. \n51.  Plaintiffs  demand  that the County of  Dauphin  immediately  desist from   strip \nsearching  individuals placed in to  the custod y  of the Dauphin County Prison absent any \nparticularized suspicion that the individuals in question have e ither contraband or weapons, and \nseeks both a preliminary and permanent injunction from this Court ordering as much. \n \nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY \n52.  The Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  13\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 1      Filed 09/16/2007     Page 14 of 16\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs Jennifer Reynolds,  Ashley McCormick, Herbert Carter and \nDevon Sheppard, on behalf of themselves and on be half of a class of others sim ilarly situated, \nrequests that this Honorable Court grant them the following relief: \n \n1.  An order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. \n2.     A  judgment  against  Defendant  County  of Dauphin awarding Compensatory \nDamages to Plaintiff and each member of the proposed class in an amount to be determined by a \nJury and/or the Court on both an individual and a class wide basis.  \n3.   A declaratory judgment declaring that the County of Dauphin’s policy, practice \nand custom of strip and visual cavity searching all detainees entering the Dauphin County Prison, \nregardless of the crime charged or suspicion of contraband, to be unconstitutional and improper.    \n4.        A preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining Defendant County of Dauphin \nfrom continuing to strip and visual cavity sear ch individuals charged with m isdemeanors or \nminor crimes absent particularized, reasonable suspicion that the arrestee subjected to the search \nis concealing weapons or other contraband. \n5.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nPlaintiffs, Jennifer Reynolds, Ashley McCormick, Herbert Carter, and Devon \nShepard, both individually and on behalf of a class of others similarly situated, \ninitiated this class action lawsuit with the filing of a civil complaint on September \n18,  2007.    (Complaint,  Doc.  1).      Plaintiffs’  complaint  alleges  that  Plaintiffs \nReynolds, Carter and Shepard were arrested on September 2, 2007 for a violation of \nthe Harrisburg City Code.  (Id. at ¶ 34).  Plaintiffs’ complaint further alleges that \nReynolds,  Carter  and  Shepard  were  transported  to  Dauphin  County  Prison \n(hereinafter “Prison”) because they could not post bond and that they were strip \nsearched upon their admittance to the Prison.  (Id.).   \nPlaintiffs’ complaint avers that Plaintiff Ashley McCormick was arrested on \nSeptember  13,  2007  for  failing  to  pay  parking  tickets  issued  by  the  City  of \nHarrisburg.  (Id. at ¶ 35).  Following McCormick’s arrest, Plaintiffs also aver that \nMcCormick  was  transported  to  Dauphin  County  Prison  where  she  was  strip \nsearched upon being admitted.  (Id.). \nPlaintiffs’ complaint claims, inter alia, that Defendant has a written and/or de \nfacto policy of strip-searching all individuals who enter the Prison regardless of the \ncrime upon which they are charged and without the presence of reasonable suspicion \nto believe that the individuals are concealing a weapon or contraband.  (Id. at ¶ 25).  \n  1     \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 16      Filed 10/25/2007     Page 7 of 27\n \nPlaintiffs  allege  in  Count  I  of  their  complaint  that  the  strip  searches  of  named \nPlaintiffs  and  unnamed  members  of  the  purported  class  violated  the  Fourth \nAmendment of the United States Constitution.  (Id. at ¶¶ 38-43).  Plaintiffs request \nin Count II of their complaint that this Honorable Court declare that the policy, \ncustom,  and  practice  of  Defendant  is  unconstitutional  because  the  correctional \nofficers of the Prison are directing/conducting strip searches of all individuals placed \ninto the Prison without any particularized suspicion that the individuals have either \ncontraband or weapons.  (Id. at ¶¶ 44-46).  Plaintiffs also set forth a separate cause \nof  action  in  Count  III  of  their  complaint  seeking  preliminary  and  permanent \ninjunctive relief, enjoining Defendant from strip searching individuals placed into \ncustody of the Prison absent any particularized suspicion that the individuals have \neither  contraband  or  weapons.    (Id.  at  ¶¶  47-51).      As  a  result  of  the  alleged \nconstitutional violation, Plaintiffs seek: (1) an order certifying this action as a class \naction; (2) a judgment against Defendant awarding compensatory damages to each \nnamed Plaintiff and each member of the purported class; (3) a declaratory judgment \ndeclaring that the Defendant’s policy, practice and custom of strip searching all \ndetainees is unconstitutional; (4) a preliminary and permanent injunction seeking to \nenjoin  Defendant  from  continuing  to  strip  search  individuals  without  reasonable \nsuspicion  that  such  individuals  are  concealing  weapons  and/or  contraband;  (5) \nattorney’s fees; (6) and punitive damages.  (Id. at p. 14; Id. at ¶ 1). \n2 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 16      Filed 10/25/2007     Page 8 of 27\n \nII.  STATEMENT OF ISSUES PRESENTED \nA.  Whether on its face and as a matter of law, Plaintiffs’ complaint \nfails  to  state  a  claim  upon  which  relief  may  be  granted  as  to \nindividuals comprising a substantial portion of the purported class \nbecause, as a matter of law, reasonable suspicion existed to strip \nsearch those individuals. \n \n[suggested answer in the affirmative] \nB.  Whether the named Plaintiffs and purported class members lack \nstanding  to  seek  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  because \nPlaintiffs’ complaint does not allege that there is a likelihood that \nthey will be subjected to the complained of conduct in the future. \n \n[suggested answer in the affirmative] \n \nC.  Whether Plaintiffs’ third purported cause of action, which requests \nan injunction, must be dismissed because such cause of action seeks \nonly a form of relief and it cannot be maintained as an independent \ncause of action as a matter of law. \n \n[suggested answer in the affirmative] \n \nD.  Whether Plaintiffs’ claim for punitive damages must be dismissed \nbecause  Plaintiffs  cannot  recover  punitive  damages  from \nDefendant as a matter of law based upon the allegations contained \nin the complaint. \n \n[suggested answer in the affirmative] \n \nE.  Whether  Plaintiffs  cannot  recover  on  their  allegations  that \nDefendant  has  a  blanket  strip  search  policy  when,  in  fact, \nDefendant has a written policy which sets forth distinct factors for \neach correctional officer to consider in his/her determination as to \nwhether the requisite reasonable suspicion exists prior to any strip \nsearch being performed. \n \n[suggested answer in the affirmative] \n \n3 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 16      Filed 10/25/2007     Page 9 of 27\n \n \nIII.  STANDARD OF LAW \n \nThe standard to be applied in consideration of a motion to dismiss pursuant to \nRule 12(b)(6) is well established in our jurisprudence.  The court is to accept as true \nall factual allegations in the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences in the \nlight most favorable to the Plaintiff.  Board of Trustees of Bricklayers and Allied \nCraftsmen Local 6 of New Jersey v. Wettlin Assoc. Inc., 237 F.3d 270, 272 (3d Cir. \n2001).  The question before the court on a motion to dismiss is whether the plaintiff \ncan prove any set of facts in support of his claim that entitles the plaintiff to relief.  \nHartford Fire Insurance Company v. California, 509 U.S. 602; 125 L. Ed. 2d 488; \n113 S. Ct. 2801 (1993), Ramadan v. Chase Manhattan Corp., 229 F.3d 194-195-96 \n(3d Cir. 2000).  If it is clear from the pleading that a defendant cannot be held liable, \nthen dismissal of all claims against that defendant is appropriate.  Labov v. Lalley, \n809 F.2d 270 (3d Cir. 1987).   In adjudicating a Rule 12(b)(6) Motion, the district \ncourt  is  not  limited  to  evaluating  the  complaint;  rather,  it  can  also  consider \ndocuments attached to the complaint, matters of public record, and undisputedly \nauthentic documents.  Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. White Consol. Industries, 998 \nF.2d 1192, 1196 (3d Cir. 1993). \n \n \n4 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 16      Filed 10/25/2007     Page 10 of 27\n \nIV.  ARGUMENT \nA.  Plaintiffs’  purported  class  is  overbroad  and  contains  putative \nmembers who cannot obtain relief as a matter of law. \n \nPlaintiffs seek class certification pursuant to Rules (23)(b)(2) and 23(b)(3), \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  (Doc. 1 at ¶¶ 18, 19).  The class that Plaintiffs \nseek to represent is the following: \n All  persons  who  have  been  or  will  be  placed  into  the \ncustody of the Dauphin County Prison after being charged \nwith  misdemeanors,  summary  offenses,  violations  of \nprobation or parole, civil commitments, or minor crimes \nand were or will be strip searched upon their entry into the \nDauphin County Prison pursuant to the policy, custom and \npractice  of  the  County  of  Dauphin.    The  class  period \ncommences on September 16, 2005 and extends to the date \non which Dauphin County is enjoined from, or otherwise \nceases, enforcing their unconstitutional policy, practice and \ncustom  of  conducting  strip  searches  absent  reasonable \nsuspicion.    Specifically  excluded  from  the  class  are \nDefendants and any and all of their respective affiliates, \nlegal  representatives,  heirs,  successors,  employees  or \nassignees.   \n \n(Id. at ¶ 9).   \n  The United States Supreme Court has held that strip searches of arrestees are \nnot per se unconstitutional.  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559; 60 L. Ed. 2d 447, \n481; 99 S. Ct. 1861, 1884 (1979).  The Court in Wolfish, however, recognized that \narrestees have a legitimate privacy interest in not being strip searched, and explained \nthat  the  government  must  have  a  reasonable  justification  for  conducting  such \nsearches: \n5 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 16      Filed 10/25/2007     Page 11 of 27\n \nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is \nnot capable of precise definition or mechanical application.  \nIn  each  case  it  requires  a  balancing  of  the  need  for  a \nparticular  search  against  the  invasion  of  personal  rights \nthat the search entails.  Courts must consider the scope of \nthe  particular  intrusion,  the  manner  in  which  it  is \nconducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in \nwhich it is conducted. \n \nId. (internal citations omitted).  The Wolfish decision acknowledged that strip and \nbody  cavity  searches  of  pretrial  detainees,  in  order  to  avoid  the  smuggling  of \ncontraband into a detention facility, was a legitimate government interest, and held \nthat prison administrators should be afforded discretion in how best to prevent such \nsmuggling.  Id. at 559 and n. 40.  Assuming, without holding, that pretrial detainees \nretain some Fourth Amendment rights upon their commitment to a detention facility, \nthe Wolfish court held that body cavity searches of pretrial detainees following \ncontact visits with any person from outside the institution did not violate the Fourth \nAmendment. \n  Interpreting Wolfish, most federal circuit courts have held that a \"blanket\" \nstrip search policy, calling for the search of all arrestees without any individualized \njustification, violates the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  See \nJones v. Edwards, 770 F.2d 739 (8th Cir. 1985); Stewart v. County of Lubbock, 767 \nF.2d 153 (5th Cir. 1985); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614 (9th Cir. 1984); Hill v. \nBogans, 735 F.2d 391 (10th Cir. 1984); Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d \n1263 (7th Cir. 1982).  The prevailing interpretation of Wolfish is that an arrestee to \n6 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 16      Filed 10/25/2007     Page 12 of 27\n \nbe detained in the general jail population has a constitutional right under the Fourth \nAmendment to be free from strip searches conducted without reasonable suspicion \nthat the detainee is concealing weapons, drugs, or other contraband, and, therefore, \nblanket strip searches of all arrestees, without individualized reasonable suspicion, \nare unconstitutional.  See, e.g., Powell v. Barrett, 496 F.3d 1288, 1310 (11th Cir. \n2007).  In order to justify a strip search of a nonviolent arrestee, the government \nmust  have  reasonable  individualized  suspicion  that  the  detainee  is  carrying  or \nconcealing contraband.  Newkirk v. Sheers, 834 F.Supp. 772, 788 (E.D.Pa. 1993).  \nIndividualized suspicion sufficient to warrant such a strip search may be based on \nsuch factors as the nature of the offense, the arrestee's appearance and conduct, and \nany prior arrest record.  Id. \nThis interpretation of Wolfish, however, has not been adopted by the United \nStates Supreme Court or the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, \nand has been questioned by other courts.  See, e.g., Hicks v. Moore, 422 F.3d 1246, \nn. 5 (11th Cir. 2005); Evans v. Stephens, 407 F.3d 1272, 1278-79 (11th Cir. 2005) \n(en banc) (\"Most of us are uncertain that jailers are required to have a reasonable \nsuspicion of weapons or contraband before strip searching – for security and safety \npurposes – arrestees bound for the general jail population . . . Never has the Supreme \nCourt imposed such a requirement.\"); Johnson v. Phelan, 69 F.3d 144, 152-153 (7th \nCir. 1995) (Posner, J., concurring and dissenting) (\"[The Fourth] Amendment has \n7 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 16      Filed 10/25/2007     Page 13 of 27\n \nbeen held inapplicable to searches and seizures within prisons, and if applicable to \njails housing pretrial detainees as distinct from convicted defendants – an unsettled \nquestion – is only tenuously so . . .\"); Brothers v. Klevenhagen, 28 F.3d 452, 457 \nand n. 6 (5th Cir. 1994) (“The Court [in Wolfish] refused to concede that the Fourth \nAmendment applies to [pretrial detainees] and concluded that no protection would \nbe afforded even if it did apply.\"); Valencia v. Wiggins, 981 F.2d 1440, 1444-45 \n(5th Cir. 1993); U.S. v. Willoughby, 860 F.2d 15, 21 (2d Cir. 1988).    \nEven  under  the  expansive  prevailing  interpretation  of  Wolfish,  which \nDauphin County does not concede is correct, Plaintiffs fail to state a claim with \nregard to a substantial portion of their proposed class.  Those courts that have held \nthat individualized reasonable suspicion is required before the government may strip \nsearch an arrestee have conceded that such reasonable suspicion may be established \nby the circumstances of an arrest or the nature of the charges brought against the \narrestee.  See Powell v. Barrett, 496 F.3d 1288, 1310 (11th Cir. 2007); Tardiff v. \nKnox County, 365 F.3d 1, 5 n.6 (1st Cir. 2004) (noting that categories such as \ncurrent charge or criminal history are a permissible way to establish reasonable \nsuspicion).   \nIn  Powell,  the  court  held  that  the  circumstances  of  a  person's  arrest  may \nsupport  reasonable  suspicion  to  justify  a  strip  search  upon  booking  into  jail, \nincluding, for example, the possession of a weapon by a detainee at the time of \n8 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 16      Filed 10/25/2007     Page 14 of 27\n \narrest.  Id.  The Powell court also held that the nature of an arrest charge itself, \nindependent  of  the  facts  surrounding  the  arrest,  can  give  rise  to  reasonable \nsuspicion; therefore, it is objectively reasonable to conduct a strip search of a person \narrested for an offense involving weapons, drugs, or violence before placing the \narrestee into the general jail population.  Id. at 1311.  This is true of all crimes \ninvolving weapons, drugs, or violence, regardless of the level of the offense.  Id. \nIn  the  end,  balancing  this  serious  intrusion  against  the \ngovernment's  compelling  interest  in  jail  security  is \nunsusceptible  of  precise  evidentiary  resolution, \nundiscernible  in  the  language  of  the  Constitution  or  the \nintent of its framers.  But the Court has the duty to draw \nthe  line  somewhere.    The  Court  holds  that  reasonable \nsuspicion exists to strip search all felony arrestees, and all \ntemporary  detainees  arrested  for  misdemeanor  offenses \nthat involve weapons or contraband.  Reasonable suspicion \nalso exists to strip search all temporary detainees with prior \nrecords  of  convictions  or  unresolved  arrests  for  felony \noffenses,  or  for  misdemeanors  involving  weapons  or \ncontraband.  Other federal courts appear to have uniformly \ndrawn the line in the same place. \n \nSmith  v.  Montgomery  County,  Maryland,  643  F.Supp.  435,  439  (D.Md.  1986) \n(examining cases). \n  In light of this precedent, it is clear that Plaintiffs fail to state a cause of action \nas to a substantial portion of their proposed class.  Plaintiffs’ proposed class includes \npersons as to whom reasonable suspicion existed, arising by the very nature of the \ncrime the person was charged or their past criminal history, i.e. those detainees \nwhose charges upon intake implicated either weapons or drugs, or who had a past \n9 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 16      Filed 10/25/2007     Page 15 of 27\n \nconviction for a felony, drug or weapons charge.  Those persons are included in \nPlaintiffs’  broad  class  definition  under  “misdemeanors,  summary  offenses, \nviolations of probation or parole, civil commitments, or minor crimes.”   \nThe following is a small sample of misdemeanors covered under Plaintiffs’ \nproposed  class  definition  where  there  exists  reasonable  suspicion  to  search:  (1) \nmanufacture, sale or delivery of a controlled substance, 35 P.S. § 780-113(a)(30); \n(2) knowingly or intentionally possessing a controlled or counterfeit substance, 35 \nP.S.  §  780-113(a)(16);  (3)  possession  of  a  small  amount  of  marijuana  only  for \npersonal use, 35 P.S. § 780-113(a)(31); (4) the use of, or possession with intent to \nuse,  drug  paraphernalia  35  P.S.  §  780-113(a)(32);  (5)  to  make,  repair,  sell  or \notherwise deal in, use, or possess any offensive weapons, with the definition of \noffensive  weapons  including  metal  knuckles,  dagger,  knife,  razor  or  cutting \ninstrument, 18 Pa.C.S. § 908.   \nAs  to  persons  who  were  charged  with  such  crimes,  reasonable  suspicion \njustifying a strip search existed.  Importantly, \"it is immaterial whether the specific \narresting  officer  or  jailer  actually  and  subjectively  had  reasonable  suspicion,  or \nwhether  anyone  at  the  time  actually  conducted  a  reasonable  suspicion  analysis.  \nPowell, 496 F.3d at 1310.  Instead, the question for the Court is \"whether, given the \ncircumstances, reasonable suspicion objectively existed to justify the search.\"  Id.  \nTherefore, as a matter of law, the strip searches of persons charged with crimes \n10 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 16      Filed 10/25/2007     Page 16 of 27\n \ninvolving weapons, violence, or drugs, and those persons with past convictions or \nunresolved arrests for felonies or crimes involving violence, weapons, or drugs, \nwere objectively justified by reasonable suspicion and did not violate the Fourth \nAmendment.  Such persons fail to state a claim for a constitutional violation, cannot \nbe included in any class definition, and cannot obtain relief based upon the claims as \nalleged.   \nAt most, Plaintiffs’ class could be comprised of the following: \n All  persons  who  have  been  or  will  be  placed  into  the \ncustody of the Dauphin County Prison after being charged \nwith  misdemeanors,  summary  offenses,  violations  of \nprobation or parole, civil commitments, or minor crimes \nand were or will be strip searched upon their entry into the \nDauphin County Prison, pursuant to the policy, custom and \npractice  of  the  County  of  Dauphin,  where  such  intake \ncrimes did or do not implicate either weapons, violence or \ndrugs, and where such persons did or will not, at the time \nof  admission  to  Dauphin  County  Prison,  have  a  past \nconviction  or  unresolved  arrest  for  a  felony  or  charge \ninvolving drug, weapons, or violence.  The class period \ncommences on September 16, 2005 and extends to the date \non which Dauphin County is enjoined from, or otherwise \nceases, enforcing their unconstitutional policy, practice and \ncustom  of  conducting  strip  searches  absent  reasonable \nsuspicion.    Specifically  excluded  from  the  class  are \nDefendants and any and all of their respective affiliates, \nlegal  representatives,  heirs,  successors,  employees  or \nassignees.  (emphasis added) \n \n  It  is  anticipated  that  Plaintiffs  will  argue  that  Defendant’s  contention  that \nPlaintiffs’ class is overbroad is premature and can only be addressed at the class \ncertification stage of this matter.  This, however, is not a question of whether the \n11 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 16      Filed 10/25/2007     Page 17 of 27\n \nproposed  class  meets  the  procedural  requirements  to  justify  class  certification; \nrather, this is simply a question of whether some members of the proposed class are \nincapable of stating a claim upon which relief may be granted.   \nThe determination whether there is a proper class does not \ndepend on the existence of a cause of action.  A suit may \nbe a proper class action, conforming to Rule 23, and still \nbe dismissed for failure to state a cause of action. \n \nMiller v. Mackey Int'l, Inc., 452 F.2d 424, 427 (5th Cir. 1971).   \n  Defendant's  contention  that  a  substantial  portion  of  the  proposed  class \nmembers fail to state a claim cannot be reserved for the class certification stage, \nbecause the Court is forbidden from inquiring into the merits of Plaintiffs’ claims at \nthat stage.  The class certification stage is reserved for an inquiry into whether the \nproposed class meets the procedural requirements of Rule 23. \nRule 23 delineates the scope of inquiry to be exercised by a \ndistrict judge in passing on a class action motion.  Nothing \nin that Rule indicates the necessity or the propriety of an \ninquiry  into  the  merits.    Indeed,  there  is  absolutely  no \nsupport in the history of Rule 23 or legal precedent for \nturning a motion under Rule 23 into a Rule 12 motion to \ndismiss or a Rule 56 motion for summary judgment by \nallowing the district judge to evaluate the possible merit of \nthe  plaintiff's  claims  at  this  stage  of  the  proceedings.  \nFailure to state a cause of action is entirely distinct from \nfailure to state a class action. \n \nId. (emphasis added).  See also Lau v. Arrow Financial Services, --- F.R.D. ---, 2007 \nWL 2840390, *4 (N.D.Ill. Sept. 28, 2007) (merits of each potential class members' \nclaims could not be addressed at class certification stage); Pruitt v. Allied Chemical \n12 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 16      Filed 10/25/2007     Page 18 of 27\n \nCorp.,  85  F.R.D.  100,  104  (E.D.Va.  1980)  (court  could  not  consider  motion  to \ndismiss, which offered potential to reduce the class to more manageable numbers, at \nthe class certification stage, because propriety of class certification under Rule 23 \nwas separate from consideration of merits under Rule 12). \nDefendant  recognizes  that  claims,  including  class  claims,  should  not  be \ndismissed on the pleadings \"unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can \nprove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\" \nConley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80, 84, 78 S. Ct. 99, 102 (1957).  \nHere, however, it can be determined from the face of the Plaintiffs’ complaint that \nthe  law  cannot  provide  recovery  based  upon  the  claims  alleged,  which  is  the \nappropriate  consideration  when  determining  a  Motion  to  Dismiss.    Defendant \nbelieves that a facial review of Plaintiffs’ complaint by the Court will reveal that \nPlaintiffs’ complaint cannot provide recovery for certain putative members of its \nclass based upon any possible set of facts even if proven to be true.  Therefore, for \nthe reasons discussed supra, Defendant respectfully requests that this Court conclude \nthat Plaintiffs’ complaint fails to state a claim as to a substantial portion of the \nproposed class, and dismiss it as such. \n \n \n \n13 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 16      Filed 10/25/2007     Page 19 of 27\n \nB.  Named Plaintiffs and purported class members lack standing to \nseek declaratory and injunctive relief because Plaintiffs’ complaint \ndoes not allege that there is a likelihood that they will be subjected \nto the complained of conduct in the future. \n \nPlaintiffs request in Count II of their complaint that this Honorable Court \ndeclare that the policy, custom, and practice of Defendant is unconstitutional in that \nthe correctional officers of the Prison are directing/conducting strip searches of all \nindividuals  placed  into  the  Prison  without  any  particularized  suspicion  that  the \nindividuals have either contraband or weapons.  (Doc. 1 at ¶¶ 44-46).  Plaintiffs also \nset  forth  a  separate  cause  of  action  in  Count  III  of  their  complaint  seeking \npreliminary  and  permanent  injunctive  relief,  enjoining  Defendant  from  strip \nsearching individuals placed into custody of the Prison absent any particularized \nsuspicion that the individuals have either contraband or weapons.   \nA review of standing is a threshold inquiry; and the proper disposition of a \ncase challenging standing is a motion to dismiss.  Hassine v. Jeffes, 846 F.2d 169, \n176 (3d Cir. 1988).  Each member of a putative class must individually possess a \nright to make a claim in a matter.  Strzakowlski v. GMC, No. 04-4740, 2005 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 18111, *26 (D.N.J. Aug. 16, 2005).  Thus, a class cannot be so broad \nas to include members who have no standing to bring suit on their on accord.  Id.; \nSee Conte-Bros. Auto. Inc. v. Quaker State-Slick 50, Inc. 165 F.3d 221 (3d. Cir. \n1998) (affirming district court’s decision to grant defendant’s motion to dismiss \nbecause putative class members lacked standing based upon the claims alleged in \n14 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 16      Filed 10/25/2007     Page 20 of 27\n \ncomplaint).    Furthermore,  a  court  may  strike  class  action  allegations  prior  to \ndiscovery when presented with a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. See Clark v. McDonald's \nCorp., 213 F.R.D. 198, 205 n.3 (D.N.J. 2003).   \nIn addition to meeting the basic requirements for standing, a plaintiff must \nalso meet the preconditions for asserting an injunctive claim in a federal forum. See \nCity of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 75 L. Ed. 2d 675, 103 S. Ct. 1660 \n(1983).  To establish standing in an action for declaratory or injunctive relief, a \nplaintiff  must  show  that  he  or  she  is  likely  to  suffer  future  injury  from  the \ndefendant's illegal conduct. Roe v. Operation Rescue, 919 F.2d 857, 864 (3d Cir. \n1990).  Past illegal conduct is insufficient to warrant injunctive or declaratory relief \nunless  it  is  accompanied  by  \"continuing,  present  adverse  effects.\"  City  of  Los \nAngeles, 461 U.S. at 102, 75 L. Ed. 2d at 684, 103 S. Ct. at 1665.  Declaratory relief \nis unavailable to a plaintiff who has alleged nothing more than exposure to past \nunconstitutional state action.  Brown v. Fauver, 819 F.2d 395 (3d Cir. 1987).   \nSeveral  courts  in  cases  challenging  the  constitutionality  of  strip  search \npolicies  have  held  that  the  plaintiffs  lacked  standing  to  pursue  injunctive  relief \nbecause they cannot show any likelihood that they will be arrested again.  See John \nDoes 1-100 v. Boyd, 613 F. Supp. 1514 (D.Minn. 1985); Smith v. Montgomery \nCounty, 573 F. Supp. 604 (D.Md. 1983).  The plaintiffs in John Does 1-100, similar \nto the Plaintiffs in this action, challenged the constitutionality of strip searches at a \n15 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 16      Filed 10/25/2007     Page 21 of 27\n \ncounty  detention  facility.  The  district  court,  relying  primarily  on  the  Supreme \nCourt's decision in Lyons, held that the plaintiff lacked standing to seek injunctive \nrelief against the detention center's strip search policy. John Does 1-100, 613 F. \nSupp.  at  1529.    The  court  noted  that  the  “named  plaintiffs  cannot  establish  a \n‘credible threat’ that they will be arrested again.\"  Id.  The court thus concluded that \nthe plaintiffs lacked standing with respect to injunctive relief. \nIn O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 38 L. Ed. 2d 674, 94 S. Ct. 669 (1974), a \nchallenge  to  discriminatory  conduct  in  the  administration  of  a  county  criminal \njustice system, the Supreme Court looked to this same factor in holding that the \nplaintiffs lacked standing to seek an injunction:  \n[H]ere the prospect of future injury rests on the likelihood \nthat  respondents  will  again  be  arrested  for  and  charged \nwith  violations  of  the  criminal  law  and  will  again  be \nsubjected to bond proceedings, trial, or sentencing before \npetitioners. . . . [w]e assume that respondents will conduct \ntheir activities within the law and so avoid prosecution and \nconviction as well as exposure to the challenged course of \nconduct said to be followed by petitioners. \n \nO’Shea, 414 U.S. at 496-97, 38 L. Ed. 2d at 683, 94 S. Ct. at 676.    \nWhile plaintiffs in the instant case may be able to allege that if they are \narrested  and  detained  again  they  will  be  strip  searched,  they  cannot  show  any \nlikelihood that they will in fact be arrested again.  Plaintiffs have not alleged that \nthey  will  not  conduct  their  future  activities  within  the  parameters  of  the  law.  \nPlaintiffs essentially allege that they have been exposed to past unconstitutional \n16 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 16      Filed 10/25/2007     Page 22 of 27\n \naction, i.e. that they were subject to an unconstitutional strip search at the Prison.  \nTherefore, Plaintiffs, named and putative class members, do not have standing to \nseek injunctive and declaratory relief based upon the allegations set forth in their \nComplaint.  Thus, Counts II and III of Plaintiffs’ complaint should be dismissed.  \n \nC.  Plaintiffs’  third  purported  cause  of  action,  which  seeks  an \ninjunction,  must  be  dismissed  because  such  cause  of  action  is  a \nform of relief and it cannot be maintained as an independent cause \nof action as a matter of law. \n \nPlaintiffs’ third cause of action is a demand for a preliminary and permanent \ninjunction.  Plaintiffs aver that the “continuing pattern of strip searching individuals \ncharged  with  minor  crimes  will  cause  irreparable  harm  to  the  new  and/or \nprospective members of the Class, an adequate remedy for which does not exist at \nlaw.”  (Doc. 1 at ¶ 50).  Although Plaintiffs do not have standing to seek injunctive \nrelief as discussed supra, the third cause of action may also be dismissed on the \ngrounds that an injunction is a form of relief and not an independent cause of action.  \nAn injunction is a form of equitable relief.  City of Los Angeles, 461 U.S. at 133, 75 \nL. Ed. at 704, 103 S. Ct at 1682.  Thus, Plaintiffs’ third cause of action must be \ndismissed on these grounds as well. \n \n \n17 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 16      Filed 10/25/2007     Page 23 of 27\n \nD.  Plaintiffs cannot recover punitive damages from Defendant as a \nmatter  of  law  based  upon  the  allegations  contained  in  their \ncomplaint. \n \nPlaintiffs seek punitive damages in paragraph 1 of their Complaint.  In City of \nNewport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453 U.S. 247,  69 L. Ed. 2d 616 , 101 S. Ct. 2748  \n(1981), the Supreme Court held that, in general, a municipality is immune from \nliability for punitive damages in a section 1983 case.  Punitive damages are only \nallowed  against  municipalities  when  expressly  provided  by  statute.    Potence  v. \nHazleton Area Sch. Dist., 357 F.3d 366, 372 (3d Cir. 2004).  There is no statutory \nprovision which expressly provides for punitive damages based upon the allegations \ncontained in Plaintiffs’ complaint.  Thus, Dauphin County is immune from liability \nfor punitive damages and the same must be stricken from Plaintiffs’ complaint. \nE.  Plaintiffs cannot recover on their allegations that Defendant has a \nblanket strip search policy when, in fact, Defendant has a written \npolicy which sets forth distinct factors for each correctional officer \nto  consider  in  his/her  determination  as  to  whether  reasonable \nsuspicion exists prior to any strip search being performed.   \n \n  Defendant has attached a copy of the Dauphin County Prison’s strip search \npolicy to its Motion Dismiss at Exhibit “A.”  The general rule is that a district court \nruling on a motion to dismiss may not consider matters extraneous to the pleadings.  \nIn  re  Burlington  Coat  Factory  Sec.  Litig,  114  F.3d  1410,  1426  (3d  Cir.  1997).  \nHowever, exceptions to the general rule include documents integral to or explicitly \nrelied  upon  in  the  complaint,  which  may  be  considered  without  converting  the \n18 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 16      Filed 10/25/2007     Page 24 of 27\n \nmotion to dismiss into one for summary judgment.  Id.  Here, the strip search policy \nattached to Defendant’s Motion and attested to by Dauphin County Prison Warden \nDominick  DeRose,  may  be  considered  by  the  Court  because  it  is  undoubtedly \nintegral and relied upon by Plaintiffs throughout the complaint and serves as the \nbasis for the entire case. \n  Plaintiffs repeatedly allege that Defendant does not have a written strip search \npolicy or, in the alternative, Defendant has a de facto strip search policy because it \nstrip searches every person entering the prison despite the existence of a written \nstrip search policy stating otherwise.  Defendant has had a written strip search policy \nat  all  times  relevant  to  the  allegations  contained  in  Plaintiffs’  complaint.  \nDefendant’s strip search policy requires each intake correctional officer to determine \nwhether the requisite particularized reasonable suspicion existed, i.e. whether the \nintake  crime  implicated  either  weapons,  violence  or  drugs,  and/or  whether  the \ndetainee had a past conviction or unresolved arrest for a felony or charge involving \ndrug,  weapons,  or  violence.    Therefore,  Plaintiffs  cannot  maintain  any  cause  of \naction set forth in their complaint on the grounds that Defendant did not have a \nwritten strip search policy and any potential recovery cannot be predicated upon the \nsame.  Thus, Plaintiffs’ averments that Defendant does not have  a  written  strip \nsearch policy and has a blanket strip search policy of searching every individual \n19 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 16      Filed 10/25/2007     Page 25 of 27\n \nadmitted to the Prison must be stricken and Plaintiffs’ recovery must be limited to \ntheir de facto policy claim.  \n  WHEREFORE, for the reasons set forth hereinabove, Defendant, County of \nDauphin, hereby requests that this Honorable grant its Motion to Dismiss and enter \nthe accompanying order. \n            Respectfully submitted,  \n            Lavery, Faherty, Young & Patterson, P.C.  \n \nDate: 10/25/07          By: /s/ Frank J.

Plaintiffs, Jennifer Reynolds, Ashley McCormick, Herbert Carter, and \nDevon  Sheppard,  both  individually  and  on  behalf  of  a  class  of  others  similarly \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 26      Filed 12/05/2007     Page 2 of 9\nsituated, initiated this class action lawsuit with the filing of a civil complaint on \nSeptember 18, 2007. (Doc. 1). \n2.  Plaintiffs  served  their  complaint  upon  Defendant  on  September  21, \n2007.   \n3.  On October 11, 2007, Defendant filed a Motion to Dismiss in response \nto Plaintiffs’ complaint.  (Doc. 12). \n4.  On October 25, 2007, Defendant filed a brief in support of its Motion to \nDismiss.  (Doc. 16). \n5.  On November 20, 2007, Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint.  (Doc. \n24). \n6.  Plaintiffs’ amended complaint alleges, inter alia, that Dauphin County \nPrison (hereinafter “Prison”) has a written and/or de facto policy of strip-searching \nall individuals who enter the Prison regardless of the crime upon which they are \ncharged  and  without  the  presence  of  reasonable  suspicion  to  believe  that  the \nindividuals are concealing a weapon or contraband.  (Id. at ¶ 25). \n7.  The class that Plaintiffs seek to represent is the following: \n All  persons  who  have  been  or  will  be  placed  into  the \ncustody of the Dauphin County Prison after being charged \nwith  misdemeanors,  summary  offenses,  violations  of \nprobation or parole, civil commitments, or minor crimes \nand were or will be strip searched upon their entry into the \nDauphin County Prison pursuant to the policy, custom and \npractice  of  the  County  of  Dauphin.    The  class  period \ncommences on September 16, 2005 and extends to the date \n  2\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 26      Filed 12/05/2007     Page 3 of 9\non which Dauphin County is enjoined from, or otherwise \nceases, enforcing their unconstitutional policy, practice and \ncustom  of  conducting  strip  searches  absent  reasonable \nsuspicion.    Specifically  excluded  from  the  class  are \nDefendants and any and all of their respective affiliates, \nlegal  representatives,  heirs,  successors,  employees  or \nassignees.   \n \n(Id. at ¶ 9). \n \n8.  Plaintiffs  seek  class  certification  pursuant  to  Rules  (23)(b)(2)  and \n23(b)(3), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  (Id. at ¶¶ 18, 19).   \n9.  Named Plaintiffs allege that they each were arrested and subsequently \nstrip searched at the Prison.  (Id. at ¶¶ 36, 37). \n10.  Plaintiffs allege in their amended complaint that the strip searches of \nnamed Plaintiffs and unnamed members of the purported class violated the Fourth \nAmendment of the United States Constitution.  (Id. at ¶¶ 42, 43). \n11.  Plaintiffs  request  in  the  sole  cause  of  action  of  their  amended \ncomplaint, inter alia, that this Honorable Court declare that the policy, custom, and \npractice  of  Defendant  is  unconstitutional  in  that  the  correctional  officers  of  the \nPrison  are  directing/conducting  strip  searches  of  all  individuals  placed  into  the \nPrison  without  any  particularized  suspicion  that  the  individuals  have  either \ncontraband or weapons.  (Id. at ¶¶ 47, 51). \n12.  Plaintiffs also seek seeking preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, \nenjoining  Defendant  from  strip  searching individuals  placed  into  custody  of  the \n  3\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 26      Filed 12/05/2007     Page 4 of 9\nPrison  absent  any  particularized  suspicion  that  the  individuals  have  either \ncontraband or weapons.  (Id. at ¶¶ 50). \n13.  As a result of the alleged constitutional violation, Plaintiffs seek an \norder certifying this action as a class action, a judgment against Defendant awarding \ncompensatory damages to each named Plaintiff and each member of the purported \nclass, a declaratory judgment declaring that the Defendant’s policy, practice and \ncustom  of  strip  searching  all  detainees  is  unconstitutional,  a  preliminary  and \npermanent injunction seeking to enjoin Defendant from continuing to strip search \nindividuals  without  reasonable  suspicion  that  such  individuals  are  concealing \nweapons and/or contraband, and attorney’s fees.  (Id. at p. 14). \n14.  The  standard  to  be  applied  in  consideration  of  a  motion  to  dismiss \npursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is well established in our jurisprudence.  The court is to \naccept  as  true  all  factual  allegations  in  the  complaint  and  draw  all  reasonable \ninferences  in  the  light  most  favorable  to  the  Plaintiff.    Board  of  Trustees  of \nBricklayers and Allied Craftsmen Local 6 of New Jersey v. Wettlin Assoc. Inc., 237 \nF.3d 270, 272 (3d Cir. 2001).   \n15.  The question before the court on a motion to dismiss is whether the \nPlaintiff can prove any set of facts in support of his claim that entitles the Plaintiff to \nrelief.    Hartford  Fire  Insurance  Company  v.  California,  113  S.  Ct.  2811,  2817 \n(1993), Ramadan v. Chase Manhattan Corp., 229 F.3d 194-195-96 (3d Cir. 2000). \n  4\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 26      Filed 12/05/2007     Page 5 of 9\n16.  If it is clear from the pleading that a defendant cannot be held liable, \nthen dismissal of all claims against that defendant is appropriate.  Labov v. Lalley, \n809 F.2d 270 (3d Cir. 1987).   \n17.  On its face and as a matter of law, Plaintiffs’ Complaint fails to set \nforth  a  claim  upon  which  relief  can  be  granted  because  the  proposed  class  is \noverbroad  and  includes  purported  members  who  cannot  recover  based  upon  the \nclaims as alleged, i.e. individuals for whom there existed a reasonable suspicion that \nhe/she possessed weapons, possessed drugs, and/or had a criminal history at the time \nhe/she was strip searched. \n18.  Named  Plaintiffs  Jennifer  Reynolds,  Herbert  Carter,  and  Devon \nShepard,  and  purported  class  members,  lack  standing  to  seek  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief because they have not alleged that there is a likelihood that they \nwill be subjected to the complained of conduct in the future. \n \n  WHEREFORE, for the reasons set forth hereinabove, Defendant, Dauphin \nCounty, hereby requests that this Honorable grant its Motion to Dismiss Amended \nComplaint and enter the accompanying order. \n \n \n \n  5\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 26      Filed 12/05/2007     Page 6 of 9\n     Respectfully submitted, \n            Lavery, Faherty, Young & Patterson, P.C.  \n \nDate: December 5, 2007         By: /s/ Frank J.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nPlaintiffs, Jennifer Reynolds, Ashley McCormick, Herbert Carter, and Devon \nShepard, both individually and on behalf of a class of others similarly situated, \ninitiated this class action lawsuit with the filing of a civil complaint on September \n18,  2007.    (Complaint,  Doc.  1).      On  November  20,  2007,  Plaintiffs  filed  an \namended  complaint.    (Amended  Complaint,  Doc.  24).    Plaintiffs’  amended \ncomplaint alleges that Plaintiffs Reynolds, Carter and Shepard were arrested on \nSeptember  2,  2007  for  a  violation  of  the  Harrisburg  City  Code.    (Id.  at  ¶  36).  \nPlaintiffs’ amended complaint further alleges that Reynolds, Carter and Shepard \nwere  transported  to  Dauphin  County  Prison  (hereinafter  “Prison”)  because  they \ncould not post bond and that they were strip searched upon their admittance to the \nPrison.  (Id.).   \nPlaintiffs’ amended complaint avers that Plaintiff Ashley McCormick was \narrested on September 13, 2007 for failing to pay parking tickets issued by the City \nof Harrisburg.  (Id. at ¶ 37).  Following McCormick’s arrest, Plaintiffs also aver that \nMcCormick  was  transported  to  Dauphin  County  Prison  where  she  was  strip \nsearched upon being admitted.  (Id.). \nPlaintiffs’ amended complaint claims, inter alia, that Defendant has a written \nand/or  de  facto  policy  of  strip-searching  all  individuals  who  enter  the  Prison \n  1     \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 27      Filed 12/05/2007     Page 7 of 23\n \nregardless of the crime upon which they are charged and without the presence of \nreasonable  suspicion  to  believe  that  the  individuals  are  concealing  a  weapon  or \ncontraband.  (Id. at ¶ 25).  Plaintiffs allege in their amended complaint that the strip \nsearches of named Plaintiffs and unnamed members of the purported class violated \nthe  Fourth  Amendment  of  the  United  States  Constitution.    (Id.  at  ¶¶  42-51).  \nPlaintiffs request that this Honorable Court declare that the policy, custom, and \npractice of Defendant is unconstitutional because the correctional officers of the \nPrison  are  directing/conducting  strip  searches  of  all  individuals  placed  into  the \nPrison  without  any  particularized  suspicion  that  the  individuals  have  either \ncontraband  or  weapons.    (Id.).    Plaintiffs  also  seek  preliminary  and  permanent \ninjunctive relief, enjoining Defendant from strip searching individuals placed into \ncustody of the Prison absent any particularized suspicion that the individuals have \neither  contraband  or  weapons.    (Id.  at  ¶¶  50).      As  a  result  of  the  alleged \nconstitutional violation, Plaintiffs seek: (1) an order certifying this action as a class \naction; (2) a judgment against Defendant awarding compensatory damages to each \nnamed Plaintiff and each member of the purported class; (3) a declaratory judgment \ndeclaring that the Defendant’s policy, practice and custom of strip searching all \ndetainees is unconstitutional; (4) a preliminary and permanent injunction seeking to \nenjoin  Defendant  from  continuing  to  strip  search  individuals  without  reasonable \n2 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 27      Filed 12/05/2007     Page 8 of 23\n \nsuspicion that such individuals are concealing weapons and/or contraband; and, (5) \nattorney’s fees.  (Id. at p. 14). \nII.  STATEMENT OF ISSUES PRESENTED \nA.  Whether on its face and as a matter of law, Plaintiffs’ amended \ncomplaint fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted as \nto individuals comprising a substantial portion of the purported \nclass because, as a matter of law, reasonable suspicion existed to \nstrip search those individuals. \n \n[suggested answer in the affirmative] \nB.  Whether  named  Plaintiffs  Reynolds,  Carter,  and  Shepard,  and \npurported class members, lack standing to seek declaratory and \ninjunctive  relief  because  Plaintiffs’  amended  complaint  does  not \nallege that there is a likelihood that they will be subjected to the \ncomplained of conduct in the future. \n \n[suggested answer in the affirmative] \n \nIII.  STANDARD OF LAW \n \nThe standard to be applied in consideration of a motion to dismiss pursuant to \nRule 12(b)(6) is well established in our jurisprudence.  The court is to accept as true \nall factual allegations in the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences in the \nlight most favorable to the Plaintiff.  Board of Trustees of Bricklayers and Allied \nCraftsmen Local 6 of New Jersey v. Wettlin Assoc. Inc., 237 F.3d 270, 272 (3d Cir. \n2001).  The question before the court on a motion to dismiss is whether the plaintiff \ncan prove any set of facts in support of his claim that entitles the plaintiff to relief.  \nHartford Fire Insurance Company v. California, 509 U.S. 602; 125 L. Ed. 2d 488; \n3 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 27      Filed 12/05/2007     Page 9 of 23\n \n113 S. Ct. 2801 (1993); Ramadan v. Chase Manhattan Corp., 229 F.3d 194-195-96 \n(3d Cir. 2000).  If it is clear from the pleading that a defendant cannot be held liable, \nthen dismissal of all claims against that defendant is appropriate.  Labov v. Lalley, \n809 F.2d 270 (3d Cir. 1987).   In adjudicating a Rule 12(b)(6) Motion, the district \ncourt  is  not  limited  to  evaluating  the  complaint;  rather,  it  can  also  consider \ndocuments attached to the complaint, matters of public record, and undisputedly \nauthentic documents.  Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. White Consol. Industries, 998 \nF.2d 1192, 1196 (3d Cir. 1993). \nIV.  ARGUMENT \nA.  Plaintiffs’  purported  class  is  overbroad  and  contains  putative \nmembers who cannot obtain relief as a matter of law. \n \nPlaintiffs seek class certification pursuant to Rules (23)(b)(2) and 23(b)(3), \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  (Doc. 1 at ¶¶ 18, 19).  The class that Plaintiffs \nseek to represent is the following: \n All  persons  who  have  been  or  will  be  placed  into  the \ncustody of the Dauphin County Prison after being charged \nwith  misdemeanors,  summary  offenses,  violations  of \nprobation or parole, civil commitments, or minor crimes \nand were or will be strip searched upon their entry into the \nDauphin County Prison pursuant to the policy, custom and \npractice  of  the  County  of  Dauphin.    The  class  period \ncommences on September 16, 2005 and extends to the date \non which Dauphin County is enjoined from, or otherwise \nceases, enforcing their unconstitutional policy, practice and \ncustom  of  conducting  strip  searches  absent  reasonable \nsuspicion.    Specifically  excluded  from  the  class  are \nDefendants and any and all of their respective affiliates, \n4 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 27      Filed 12/05/2007     Page 10 of 23\n \nlegal  representatives,  heirs,  successors,  employees  or \nassignees.   \n \n(Id. at ¶ 9).   \n  The United States Supreme Court has held that strip searches of arrestees are \nnot per se unconstitutional.  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559; 60 L. Ed. 2d 447, \n481; 99 S. Ct. 1861, 1884 (1979).  The Court in Wolfish, however, recognized that \narrestees have a legitimate privacy interest in not being strip searched, and explained \nthat  the  government  must  have  a  reasonable  justification  for  conducting  such \nsearches: \nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is \nnot capable of precise definition or mechanical application.  \nIn  each  case  it  requires  a  balancing  of  the  need  for  a \nparticular  search  against  the  invasion  of  personal  rights \nthat the search entails.  Courts must consider the scope of \nthe  particular  intrusion,  the  manner  in  which  it  is \nconducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in \nwhich it is conducted. \n \nId. (internal citations omitted).  The Wolfish decision acknowledged that halting the \nsmuggling  of  contraband  into  a  detention  facility  was  a  legitimate  government \ninterest that could justify strip and body cavity searches of pretrial detainees, and \nheld that prison administrators should be afforded discretion in how best to prevent \nsuch smuggling.  Id. at 559 and n. 40.  Assuming, without holding, that pretrial \ndetainees  retain  some  Fourth  Amendment  rights  upon  their  commitment  to  a \ndetention  facility,  the  Wolfish  court  held  that  body  cavity  searches  of  pretrial \n5 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 27      Filed 12/05/2007     Page 11 of 23\n \ndetainees following contact visits with any person from outside the institution did \nnot violate the Fourth Amendment. \n  Interpreting Wolfish, most federal circuit courts have held that a \"blanket\" \nstrip search policy, calling for the search of all arrestees without any individualized \njustification, violates the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  See \nJones v. Edwards, 770 F.2d 739 (8th Cir. 1985); Stewart v. County of Lubbock, 767 \nF.2d 153 (5th Cir. 1985); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614 (9th Cir. 1984); Hill v. \nBogans, 735 F.2d 391 (10th Cir. 1984); Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d \n1263 (7th Cir. 1982).  The prevailing interpretation of Wolfish is that an arrestee to \nbe detained in the general jail population has a constitutional right under the Fourth \nAmendment to be free from strip searches conducted without reasonable suspicion \nthat the detainee is concealing weapons, drugs, or other contraband, and, therefore, \nblanket strip searches of all arrestees, without individualized reasonable suspicion, \nare unconstitutional.  See, e.g., Powell v. Barrett, 496 F.3d 1288, 1310 (11th Cir. \n2007).  A strip search of a nonviolent arrestee is justified where the government has \nreasonable  individualized  suspicion  that  the  detainee  is  carrying  or  concealing \ncontraband.    Newkirk  v.  Sheers,  834  F.Supp.  772,  788  (E.D.Pa.  1993).  \nIndividualized suspicion sufficient to warrant such a strip search may be based on \nsuch factors as the nature of the offense, the arrestee's appearance and conduct, and \nany prior arrest record.  Id. \n6 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 27      Filed 12/05/2007     Page 12 of 23\n \nThis interpretation of Wolfish, however, has not been adopted by the United \nStates Supreme Court or the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, \nand has been questioned by other courts.  See, e.g., Hicks v. Moore, 422 F.3d 1246, \nn. 5 (11th Cir. 2005); Evans v. Stephens, 407 F.3d 1272, 1278-79 (11th Cir. 2005) \n(en banc) (\"Most of us are uncertain that jailers are required to have a reasonable \nsuspicion of weapons or contraband before strip searching – for security and safety \npurposes – arrestees bound for the general jail population . . . Never has the Supreme \nCourt imposed such a requirement.\"); Johnson v. Phelan, 69 F.3d 144, 152-153 (7th \nCir. 1995) (Posner, J., concurring and dissenting) (\"[The Fourth] Amendment has \nbeen held inapplicable to searches and seizures within prisons, and if applicable to \njails housing pretrial detainees as distinct from convicted defendants – an unsettled \nquestion – is only tenuously so . . .\"); Brothers v. Klevenhagen, 28 F.3d 452, 457 \nand n. 6 (5th Cir. 1994) (“The Court [in Wolfish] refused to concede that the Fourth \nAmendment applies to [pretrial detainees] and concluded that no protection would \nbe afforded even if it did apply.\"); Valencia v. Wiggins, 981 F.2d 1440, 1444-45 \n(5th Cir. 1993); U.S. v. Willoughby, 860 F.2d 15, 21 (2d Cir. 1988).    \nEven  under  the  expansive  prevailing  interpretation  of  Wolfish,  which \nDauphin County does not concede is correct, Plaintiffs fail to state a claim with \nregard to a substantial portion of their proposed class.  Those courts that have held \nthat individualized reasonable suspicion is required before the government may strip \n7 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 27      Filed 12/05/2007     Page 13 of 23\n \nsearch an arrestee have conceded that such reasonable suspicion may be established \nby the circumstances of an arrest or the nature of the charges brought against the \narrestee.  See Powell v. Barrett, 496 F.3d 1288, 1310 (11th Cir. 2007); Tardiff v. \nKnox County, 365 F.3d 1, 5 n.6 (1st Cir. 2004) (noting that categories such as \ncurrent charge or criminal history present a permissible way to establish reasonable \nsuspicion).   \nIn  Powell,  the  court  held  that  the  circumstances  of  a  person's  arrest  may \nsupport  reasonable  suspicion  to  justify  a  strip  search  upon  booking  into  jail, \nincluding, for example, the possession of a weapon by a detainee at the time of \narrest.  Id.  The Powell court also held that the nature of an arrest charge itself, \nindependent  of  the  facts  surrounding  the  arrest,  can  give  rise  to  reasonable \nsuspicion; therefore, it is objectively reasonable to conduct a strip search of a person \narrested for an offense involving weapons, drugs, or violence before placing the \narrestee into the general jail population.  Id. at 1311.  This is true of all crimes \ninvolving weapons, drugs, or violence, regardless of the level of the offense.  Id. \nIn  the  end,  balancing  this  serious  intrusion  against  the \ngovernment's  compelling  interest  in  jail  security  is \nunsusceptible  of  precise  evidentiary  resolution, \nundiscernible  in  the  language  of  the  Constitution  or  the \nintent of its framers.  But the Court has the duty to draw \nthe  line  somewhere.    The  Court  holds  that  reasonable \nsuspicion exists to strip search all felony arrestees, and all \ntemporary  detainees  arrested  for  misdemeanor  offenses \nthat involve weapons or contraband.  Reasonable suspicion \nalso exists to strip search all temporary detainees with prior \n8 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 27      Filed 12/05/2007     Page 14 of 23\n \nrecords  of  convictions  or  unresolved  arrests  for  felony \noffenses,  or  for  misdemeanors  involving  weapons  or \ncontraband.  Other federal courts appear to have uniformly \ndrawn the line in the same place. \n \nSmith  v.  Montgomery  County,  Maryland,  643  F.Supp.  435,  439  (D.Md.  1986) \n(examining cases). \n  In light of this precedent, it is clear that Plaintiffs fail to state a cause of action \nas to a substantial portion of their proposed class.  Plaintiffs’ proposed class includes \npersons as to whom reasonable suspicion existed, arising by the very nature of the \ncrime the person was charged or their past criminal history, i.e. those detainees \nwhose charges upon intake implicated either weapons or drugs, or who had a past \nconviction for a felony, drug or weapons charge.  Those persons are included in \nPlaintiffs’  broad  class  definition  under  “persons…charged  with  misdemeanors, \nsummary offenses, violations of probation or parole, civil commitments, or minor \ncrimes.”   \nThe following is a small sample of misdemeanors covered under Plaintiffs’ \nproposed  class  definition  where  there  exists  reasonable  suspicion  to  search:  (1) \nmanufacture, sale or delivery of a controlled substance, 35 P.S. § 780-113(a)(30); \n(2) knowingly or intentionally possessing a controlled or counterfeit substance, 35 \nP.S.  §  780-113(a)(16);  (3)  possession  of  a  small  amount  of  marijuana  only  for \npersonal use, 35 P.S. § 780-113(a)(31); (4) the use of, or possession with intent to \nuse,  drug  paraphernalia  35  P.S.  §  780-113(a)(32);  (5)  to  make,  repair,  sell  or \n9 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 27      Filed 12/05/2007     Page 15 of 23\n \notherwise deal in, use, or possess any offensive weapons, with the definition of \noffensive  weapons  including  metal  knuckles,  dagger,  knife,  razor  or  cutting \ninstrument, 18 Pa.C.S. § 908.   \nAs  to  persons  who  were  charged  with  such  crimes,  reasonable  suspicion \njustifying a strip search existed.  Importantly, \"it is immaterial whether the specific \narresting  officer  or  jailer  actually  and  subjectively  had  reasonable  suspicion,  or \nwhether  anyone  at  the  time  actually  conducted  a  reasonable  suspicion  analysis.  \nPowell, 496 F.3d at 1310 (emphasis in original).  Instead, the question for the Court \nis \"whether, given the circumstances, reasonable suspicion objectively existed to \njustify the search.\"  Id.  Therefore, as a matter of law, the strip searches of persons \ncharged with crimes involving weapons, violence, or drugs, and those persons with \npast convictions or unresolved arrests for felonies or crimes involving violence, \nweapons, or drugs, were objectively justified by reasonable suspicion and did not \nviolate  the  Fourth  Amendment.    Such  persons  fail  to  state  a  claim  for  a \nconstitutional violation, cannot be included in any class definition, and cannot obtain \nrelief based upon the claims as alleged.   \nAt most, Plaintiffs’ class could be comprised of the following: \n All  persons  who  have  been  or  will  be  placed  into  the \ncustody of the Dauphin County Prison after being charged \nwith  misdemeanors,  summary  offenses,  violations  of \nprobation or parole, civil commitments, or minor crimes \nand were or will be strip searched upon their entry into the \nDauphin County Prison, pursuant to the policy, custom and \n10 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 27      Filed 12/05/2007     Page 16 of 23\n \npractice  of  the  County  of  Dauphin,  where  such  intake \ncrimes did or do not implicate either weapons, violence or \ndrugs, and where such persons did or will not, at the time \nof  admission  to  Dauphin  County  Prison,  have  a  past \nconviction  or  unresolved  arrest  for  a  felony  or  charge \ninvolving drug, weapons, or violence.  The class period \ncommences on September 16, 2005 and extends to the date \non which Dauphin County is enjoined from, or otherwise \nceases, enforcing their unconstitutional policy, practice and \ncustom  of  conducting  strip  searches  absent  reasonable \nsuspicion.    Specifically  excluded  from  the  class  are \nDefendants and any and all of their respective affiliates, \nlegal  representatives,  heirs,  successors,  employees  or \nassignees.  (emphasis added) \n \n  It  is  anticipated  that  Plaintiffs  will  argue  that  Defendant’s  contention  that \nPlaintiffs’ class is overbroad is premature and can only be addressed at the class \ncertification stage of this matter.  This, however, is not a question of whether the \nproposed  class  meets  the  procedural  requirements  to  justify  class  certification; \nrather, this is simply a question of whether some members of the proposed class are \nincapable of stating a claim upon which relief may be granted.   \nThe determination whether there is a proper class does not \ndepend on the existence of a cause of action.  A suit may \nbe a proper class action, conforming to Rule 23, and still \nbe dismissed for failure to state a cause of action. \n \nMiller v. Mackey Int'l, Inc., 452 F.2d 424, 427 (5th Cir. 1971).   \n  Defendant's  contention  that  a  substantial  portion  of  the  proposed  class \nmembers fail to state a claim cannot be reserved for the class certification stage, \nbecause the Court is forbidden from inquiring into the merits of Plaintiffs’ claims at \n11 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 27      Filed 12/05/2007     Page 17 of 23\n \nthat stage.  The class certification stage is reserved for an inquiry into whether the \nproposed class meets the procedural requirements of Rule 23. \nRule 23 delineates the scope of inquiry to be exercised by a \ndistrict judge in passing on a class action motion.  Nothing \nin that Rule indicates the necessity or the propriety of an \ninquiry  into  the  merits.    Indeed,  there  is  absolutely  no \nsupport in the history of Rule 23 or legal precedent for \nturning a motion under Rule 23 into a Rule 12 motion to \ndismiss or a Rule 56 motion for summary judgment by \nallowing the district judge to evaluate the possible merit of \nthe  plaintiff's  claims  at  this  stage  of  the  proceedings.  \nFailure to state a cause of action is entirely distinct from \nfailure to state a class action. \n \nId. (emphasis added).  See also Lau v. Arrow Financial Services, --- F.R.D. ---, 2007 \nWL 2840390, *4 (N.D.Ill. Sept. 28, 2007) (merits of each potential class members' \nclaims could not be addressed at class certification stage); Pruitt v. Allied Chemical \nCorp.,  85  F.R.D.  100,  104  (E.D.Va.  1980)  (court  could  not  consider  motion  to \ndismiss, which offered potential to reduce the class to more manageable numbers, at \nthe class certification stage, because propriety of class certification under Rule 23 \nwas separate from consideration of merits under Rule 12). \nDefendant  recognizes  that  claims,  including  class  claims,  should  not  be \ndismissed on the pleadings \"unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can \nprove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\" \nConley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80, 84, 78 S. Ct. 99, 102 (1957).  \nHere, however, it can be determined from the face of the Plaintiffs’ complaint that \n12 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 27      Filed 12/05/2007     Page 18 of 23\n \nthe  law  cannot  provide  recovery  based  upon  the  claims  alleged,  which  is  the \nappropriate  consideration  when  determining  a  Motion  to  Dismiss.    Defendant \nbelieves that a facial review of Plaintiffs’ complaint by the Court will reveal that \nPlaintiffs’ complaint cannot provide recovery for certain putative members of its \nclass based upon any possible set of facts even if proven to be true.  Therefore, for \nthe reasons discussed supra, Defendant respectfully requests that this Court conclude \nthat Plaintiffs’ complaint fails to state a claim as to a substantial portion of the \nproposed class, and dismiss it as such. \nB.  Named Plaintiffs Reynolds, Carter, and Shepard, and purported \nclass  members  lack  standing  to  seek  declaratory  and  injunctive \nrelief because Plaintiffs’ amended complaint does not allege that \nthere is a likelihood that they will be subjected to the complained of \nconduct in the future. \n \nA review of standing is a threshold inquiry; and the proper disposition of a \ncase challenging standing is a motion to dismiss.  Hassine v. Jeffes, 846 F.2d 169, \n176 (3d Cir. 1988).  Each member of a putative class must individually possess a \nright to make a claim in a matter.  Strzakowlski v. GMC, No. 04-4740, 2005 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 18111, *26 (D.N.J. Aug. 16, 2005).  Thus, a class cannot be so broad \nas to include members who have no standing to bring suit on their on accord.  Id.; \nSee Conte-Bros. Auto. Inc. v. Quaker State-Slick 50, Inc. 165 F.3d 221 (3d. Cir. \n1998) (affirming district court’s decision to grant defendant’s motion to dismiss \nbecause putative class members lacked standing based upon the claims alleged in \n13 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 27      Filed 12/05/2007     Page 19 of 23\n \ncomplaint).    Furthermore,  a  court  may  strike  class  action  allegations  prior  to \ndiscovery when presented with a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. See Clark v. McDonald's \nCorp., 213 F.R.D. 198, 205 n.3 (D.N.J. 2003).   \nIn addition to meeting the basic requirements for standing, a plaintiff must \nalso meet the preconditions for asserting an injunctive claim in a federal forum. See \nCity of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 75 L. Ed. 2d 675, 103 S. Ct. 1660 \n(1983).  To establish standing in an action for declaratory or injunctive relief, a \nplaintiff  must  show  that  he  or  she  is  likely  to  suffer  future  injury  from  the \ndefendant's illegal conduct. Roe v. Operation Rescue, 919 F.2d 857, 864 (3d Cir. \n1990).  Past illegal conduct is insufficient to warrant injunctive or declaratory relief \nunless  it  is  accompanied  by  \"continuing,  present  adverse  effects.\"  City  of  Los \nAngeles, 461 U.S. at 102, 75 L. Ed. 2d at 684, 103 S. Ct. at 1665.  Declaratory relief \nis unavailable to a plaintiff who has alleged nothing more than exposure to past \nunconstitutional state action.  Brown v. Fauver, 819 F.2d 395 (3d Cir. 1987).   \nSeveral  courts  in  cases  challenging  the  constitutionality  of  strip  search \npolicies  have  held  that  the  plaintiffs  lacked  standing  to  pursue  injunctive  relief \nbecause they cannot show any likelihood that they will be arrested again.  See John \nDoes 1-100 v. Boyd, 613 F. Supp. 1514 (D.Minn. 1985); Smith v. Montgomery \nCounty, 573 F. Supp. 604 (D.Md. 1983).  The plaintiffs in John Does 1-100, similar \nto the Plaintiffs in this action, challenged the constitutionality of strip searches at a \n14 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 27      Filed 12/05/2007     Page 20 of 23\n \ncounty  detention  facility.  The  district  court,  relying  primarily  on  the  Supreme \nCourt's decision in Lyons, held that the plaintiff lacked standing to seek injunctive \nrelief against the detention center's strip search policy. John Does 1-100, 613 F. \nSupp.  at  1529.    The  court  noted  that  the  “named  plaintiffs  cannot  establish  a \n‘credible threat’ that they will be arrested again.\"  Id.  The court thus concluded that \nthe plaintiffs lacked standing with respect to injunctive relief. \nIn O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 38 L. Ed. 2d 674, 94 S. Ct. 669 (1974), a \nchallenge  to  discriminatory  conduct  in  the  administration  of  a  county  criminal \njustice system, the Supreme Court looked to this same factor in holding that the \nplaintiffs lacked standing to seek an injunction:  \n[H]ere the prospect of future injury rests on the likelihood \nthat  respondents  will  again  be  arrested  for  and  charged \nwith  violations  of  the  criminal  law  and  will  again  be \nsubjected to bond proceedings, trial, or sentencing before \npetitioners. . . . [w]e assume that respondents will conduct \ntheir activities within the law and so avoid prosecution and \nconviction as well as exposure to the challenged course of \nconduct said to be followed by petitioners. \n \nO’Shea, 414 U.S. at 496-97, 38 L. Ed. 2d at 683, 94 S. Ct. at 676.    \nWhile Plaintiffs in the instant case may be able to allege that if they are \narrested  and  detained  again  they  will  be  strip  searched,  they  cannot  show  any \nlikelihood that they will in fact be arrested again.  Plaintiffs Reynolds, Carter, and \nShepard have not alleged that they will not conduct their future activities within the \nparameters of the law.  Plaintiffs essentially allege that they have been exposed to \n15 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 27      Filed 12/05/2007     Page 21 of 23\n \npast unconstitutional action, i.e. that they were subject to an unconstitutional strip \nsearch  at  the  Prison.    Therefore,  Plaintiffs  Reynolds,  Shepard,  and  Carter,  and \nputative class members, do not have standing to seek injunctive and declaratory \nrelief based upon the allegations set forth in their amended complaint.  Thus, such \nclaims for relief must be dismissed.  \n \n  WHEREFORE, for the reasons set forth hereinabove, Defendant, County of \nDauphin, hereby requests that this Honorable grant its Motion to Dismiss and enter \nthe accompanying order. \n \n     Respectfully submitted, \n            Lavery, Faherty, Young & Patterson, P.C.  \n \nDate: December 5, 2007         By: /s/ Frank J.

Plaintiffs, Jennifer Reynolds, Ashley McCormick, Herbert Carter, and \nDevon  Sheppard,  both  individually  and  on  behalf  of  a  class  of  others  similarly \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 12      Filed 10/11/2007     Page 2 of 10\nsituated, initiated this class action lawsuit with the filing of a civil complaint on \nSeptember 18, 2007. \n2.  Plaintiffs  served  their  complaint  upon  Defendant  on  September  21, \n2007.   \n3.  Plaintiffs’ complaint alleges, inter alia, that Dauphin County Prison \n(hereinafter  “Prison”)  has  a  written  and/or  de  facto  policy  of  strip-searching  all \nindividuals  who  enter  the  Prison  regardless  of  the  crime  upon  which  they  are \ncharged  and  without  the  presence  of  reasonable  suspicion  to  believe  that  the \nindividuals are concealing a weapon or contraband.  (Complaint, Doc. 1, ¶ 25). \n4.  The class that Plaintiffs seek to represent is the following: \n All  persons  who  have  been  or  will  be  placed  into  the \ncustody of the Dauphin County Prison after being charged \nwith  misdemeanors,  summary  offenses,  violations  of \nprobation or parole, civil commitments, or minor crimes \nand were or will be strip searched upon their entry into the \nDauphin County Prison pursuant to the policy, custom and \npractice  of  the  County  of  Dauphin.    The  class  period \ncommences on September 16, 2005 and extends to the date \non which Dauphin County is enjoined from, or otherwise \nceases, enforcing their unconstitutional policy, practice and \ncustom  of  conducting  strip  searches  absent  reasonable \nsuspicion.    Specifically  excluded  from  the  class  are \nDefendants and any and all of their respective affiliates, \nlegal  representatives,  heirs,  successors,  employees  or \nassignees.   \n \n(Id. at ¶ 9). \n \n  2\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 12      Filed 10/11/2007     Page 3 of 10\n5.  Plaintiffs  seek  class  certification  pursuant  to  Rules  (23)(b)(2)  and \n23(b)(3), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  (Id. at ¶¶ 18, 19).   \n6.  Named Plaintiffs allege that they each were arrested and subsequently \nstrip searched at the Prison.  (Id. at ¶¶ 34-37). \n7.  Plaintiffs allege in Count I of their complaint that the strip searches of \nnamed Plaintiffs and unnamed members of the purported class violated the Fourth \nAmendment of the United States Constitution.  (Id. at ¶¶ 38-43). \n8.  Plaintiffs request in Count II of their complaint that this Honorable \nCourt declare that the policy, custom, and practice of Defendant is unconstitutional \nin that the correctional officers of the Prison are directing/conducting strip searches \nof all individuals placed into the Prison without any particularized suspicion that the \nindividuals have either contraband or weapons.  (Id. at ¶¶ 44-46). \n9.  Plaintiffs also set forth a separate cause of action in Count III of their \ncomplaint seeking preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, enjoining Defendant \nfrom  strip  searching  individuals  placed  into  custody  of  the  Prison  absent  any \nparticularized suspicion that the individuals have either contraband or weapons.  (Id. \nat ¶¶ 47-51). \n10.  As a result of the alleged constitutional violation, Plaintiffs seek an \norder certifying this action as a class action, a judgment against Defendant awarding \ncompensatory damages to each named Plaintiff and each member of the purported \n  3\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 12      Filed 10/11/2007     Page 4 of 10\nclass, a declaratory judgment declaring that the Defendant’s policy, practice and \ncustom  of  strip  searching  all  detainees  is  unconstitutional,  a  preliminary  and \npermanent injunction seeking to enjoin Defendant from continuing to strip search \nindividuals  without  reasonable  suspicion  that  such  individuals  are  concealing \nweapons and/or contraband, attorney’s fees, and punitive damages.  (Id. at ¶ 1, p. \n14). \n11.  The  standard  to  be  applied  in  consideration  of  a  motion  to  dismiss \npursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is well established in our jurisprudence.  The court is to \naccept  as  true  all  factual  allegations  in  the  complaint  and  draw  all  reasonable \ninferences  in  the  light  most  favorable  to  the  Plaintiff.    Board  of  Trustees  of \nBricklayers and Allied Craftsmen Local 6 of New Jersey v. Wettlin Assoc. Inc., 237 \nF.3d 270, 272 (3d Cir. 2001).   \n12.  The question before the court on a motion to dismiss is whether the \nPlaintiff can prove any set of facts in support of his claim that entitles the Plaintiff to \nrelief.    Hartford  Fire  Insurance  Company  v.  California,  113  S.  Ct.  2811,  2817 \n(1993), Ramadan v. Chase Manhattan Corp., 229 F.3d 194-195-96 (3d Cir. 2000). \n13.  If it is clear from the pleading that a defendant cannot be held liable, \nthen dismissal of all claims against that defendant is appropriate.  Labov v. Lalley, \n809 F.2d 270 (3d Cir. 1987).   \n  4\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 12      Filed 10/11/2007     Page 5 of 10\n14.  In adjudicating a Rule 12(b)(6) Motion, the district court is not limited \nto evaluating the Complaint, rather it can also consider documents attached to the \ncomplaint, matters of public record, and undisputedly authentic documents.  Pension \nBenefit  Guar.  Corp.  v.  White  Consol.  Industries,  998  F.2d  1192,  1196  (3d  Cir. \n1993). \n15.  On its face and as a matter of law, Plaintiffs’ Complaint fails to set \nforth  a  claim  upon  which  relief  can  be  granted  because  the  proposed  class  is \noverbroad  and  includes  purported  members  who  cannot  recover  based  upon  the \nclaims as alleged, i.e. individuals for whom there existed a reasonable suspicion that \nhe/she possessed weapons, possessed drugs, and/or had a criminal history at the time \nhe/she was strip searched. \n16.  Named Plaintiffs and purported class members lack standing to seek \ndeclaratory  and  injunctive  relief  because  they  have  not  alleged  that  there  is  a \nlikelihood that they will be subjected to the complained of conduct in the future. \n17.  The third purported cause of action set forth in Plaintiffs’ Complaint, \nwhich requests an injunction, must be dismissed because such cause of action seeks \nonly a form of relief and it cannot be maintained as an independent cause of action \nas a matter of law. \n18.  Plaintiffs cannot recover punitive damages from Defendant as a matter \nof law based upon the allegations contained in the complaint. \n  5\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 12      Filed 10/11/2007     Page 6 of 10\n19.  Plaintiffs  cannot  recover  on  their  allegations  that  Defendant  has  a \nblanket strip search policy when, in fact, Defendant has a written policy which sets \nforth  distinct  factors  for  each  correctional  officer  to  consider  in  his/her \ndetermination as to whether reasonable suspicion exists prior to any strip search \nbeing  performed.    Plaintiffs’  claims  in  this  regard  should  be  limited  to  the \nallegations of a de facto, unconstitutional policy or custom.  A true and correct copy \nof the Prison’s strip search policy with original Affidavit attesting to its authenticity \nis attached hereto and marked as Exhibit “A”.     \n \n  WHEREFORE, for the reasons set forth hereinabove, Defendant, County of \nDauphin, hereby requests that this Honorable grant its Motion to Dismiss and enter \nthe accompanying order. \n  6\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 12      Filed 10/11/2007     Page 7 of 10\n \nRespectfully submitted, \n            Lavery, Faherty, Young & Patterson, P.C.  \n \nDate: October 11, 2007         By: /s/ Frank J.

ARGUMENT \n \nA.  Plaintiffs Attempt To Introduce Facts That May Not Be \nConsidered  By  The Co urt  When Ruling On \nDefendant’s Motion To Dismiss. \n       \n  Plaintiffs attach documents to thei r Brief In Opposition to Defendant's \nMotion  to Dismiss that the Court should not consi der  when ruling on \nDefendant’s  Motion to Dismiss.  Plaintiffs rely upon these documents to \nsupport their arguments th roughout their Brief.  (See , Doc. 45, pp. 1-3, 7, \n10).   As Plaintiffs aptly point out  in  their introducti on,  when ruling on a \ndefendant's motion to dismiss, a judge mu st accept as true all of the factual \nallegations contained in the complaint.   (Doc. 45, p. 1); Erickson v. Pardus , \n___ U.S. ___, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 2200, 167  L. Ed.2d 1081 (2007).  The court \nmay  only  consider certai n  narrowly def ined  types of materi al  without \nconverting the motion to dismiss to a summary judgment motion, including a \ndocument that is integral to or explicitly reli ed upon in the complaint. In re \nRockefeller Center Properties, Inc. Securities Litig. , 184 F.3d 280, 287 (3d \nCir. 1999).  A court may also consid er an \"undisputedly authentic document \nthat a defendant attaches as an exhibit to a motion to dismiss if the plaintiff's \n1 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 51      Filed 01/23/2008     Page 7 of 31\n \nclaims are based on the document.\"  P ension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. White \nConsol. Indus., Inc., 998 F.2d 1192, 1196 (3d Cir. 1993) (emphasis added). \nPlaintiffs have attached several ex trinsic documents to their brief in \nopposition  to Defendant's Motion to  Dismiss,  including a document \ncaptioned as a “post order” which purported ly describes job responsibilities \nof a booking officer at the Prison, (Doc . 45, Exhibit “B”), and excerpts of the \ndeposition transcript of Dauphin County Prison Warden Dominick DeRose.   \n(Doc. 45, Exhibit “A”).  These extrinsic documents are neither integral to nor \nexpressly  relied upon in the Complain t,  and Defendant did not introduce \nthem at this stage.  Plaintiffs cannot present the Court with the “post order” \nor DeRose’s deposition transcript to support their arguments in opposition to \nDefendant’s Motion to Dismiss because such documents are not integral  to \nor explicitly relied upon in the Amended Complaint.  In re Rockefeller Center \nProperties, Inc. Securities Litig., supra.   \nEven if such documents were int egral or relied upon in the Amended \nComplaint,  only Defendant may introdu ce  documents in support of its \nargument.  Pension Benefit Guar. Corp., supra.  Thus, Defendant urges this \nCourt to ignore the documents attached to Plaintiffs’ Brief in Oppositi on and \ntheir  arguments arising there from  when  ruling  on Defendant’s  Motion to \nDismiss.  \n2 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 51      Filed 01/23/2008     Page 8 of 31\n \nB.  Plaintiffs'  Proposed Class Is Facially   Overbroad \nBecause  It Contains Putati ve  Members Whom, As A \nMatter Of Law, Defendant  Had Reasonable Suspicion \nTo  Strip Search, And The Cour t  Should Therefor e \nDismiss Those Putative Members By Limiting Plaintiffs' \nClass Definition In Accord With Established Law. \n \n  As  set forth i n  Defendant's initi al  brief i n  support of its Moti on  to \nDismiss,  Plaintiffs have drawn their  proposed  class  so  broadly  that it \nencompasses arrestees whom Defendant  could constitutionally strip search \nbased entirely on the nature of their offense or their past criminal history.   \nSee Defendant's Brief In Support Of Its Motion To Dismiss The Amended \nComplaint (\"Defendant's Brief\") at § IV(A).   \nst th\nCourts of Appeal in the 1  and 11  Circuits, and a District Court in the \nth\n4  Circuit, have held that j ail administrators may strip search, without any \nfurther individualized suspicion, an arrestee who has been detained for a \ncrime  involving weapons or contraband,   or who has a prior record of \nconvictions or unresolved arrests for felonies, or for misdemeanors involving \nweapons or contraband.  S ee Powell v. Barrett, 496 F.3d 1288, 1310 (11th \nCir. 2007); Tardiff v. Knox County , 365 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2004); Smith v. \nMontgomery County, 643 F. Supp. 435, 439  (D.Md. 1986).  Defendant has \nrequested that this Court reach a si milar conclusion, and hold that, as a \nmatter of law, Plaintiff's proposed class is overly broad  because it includes \nputative class members who fall within these categories.   \n3 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 51      Filed 01/23/2008     Page 9 of 31\n \n1.  Defendant Has Not Conceded That Blanket Strip \nSearch Policies Are Unconstitutional. \n \n  No court has issued any judicial opinion, controlling upon this Court, \nholding that individualized reasonable suspicion is required to strip search a \npretrial detainee.  The United States  Supreme Court, in its only decision on \nthe question, refused to even find t hat pretrial detainees retain any Fourth \nAmendment rights upon their commitment to a detention facility.  See Bell v. \nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 560 (1979). \nLegal precedent interpreting the Supreme Court's decisi on in Wolfish \nis inconsistent, and several courts have held that no reasonable suspicion is \nrequired to justify the strip searc h of a pretri al detainee.  See  Defendant's \nBrief at pp. 7-10 (noting that neither the Supreme Court nor the Third Circuit \nhas held that individualized reasonable suspicion is required to strip search \na pretrial detainee, and setting forth six f ederal circuit decisions critical of \nthat prevailing interpretation of Bell v. Wolfish ).  Most recentl y, the Virginia \nCourt of Appeals held that a visual cavi ty search (strip search) of a pretri al \ndetainee  need not be justi fied  by reas onable  suspicion  to pass scruti ny \nunder the Fourth Amendment.  See  Winston v. Comm. , 654 S.E.2d 340, \n2007 WL 4523089 (Va. App. Dec. 27, 2007) (citi ng Wolfish, 441 U.S. at \n559). \n4 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 51      Filed 01/23/2008     Page 10 of 31\n \nGiven  this  lack of uniformity, Pl aintiffs'  statement that \"The County \nacknowledges  that bl anket  strip  search  policies/practices  are \nunconstitutional,\"  Plaintiffs'  Brief at p. 4, is a mischaracterization.  See  \nDefendant's  Brief at 6 (re cognizing  that the preva iling  interpretation of \nWolfish requires reasonable suspicion to justify a strip search of a detainee, \nbut citing dissenting opinions).  To the contrary, the County will contend that \nthe  prevailing i nterpretation  of Wol fish  is incorrect, and that reasonable \nsuspicion is not required to strip search a pretri al detainee.  The Court's \nconsideration of Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, however, does not require \nany examination or resolution of these competing viewpoints. \n2.  Defendant Urges This Court Find, as A Matter of \nLaw, That No Reasonable Suspicion is Required \nto  Strip Search an Arrestee Who Has Been \nDetained  for A Crime Involving Weapons, \nViolence  or Contraband, or Who Has A Prior \nRecord of Convictions or Unresolved Arrests for \nFelonies,  or for Crimes Involving Weapons, \nViolence or Contraband.    \n \na.  The nature of an arrestee's offense, or their \nprior criminal record, properly  establishes \nreasonable  suspicion and objectivel y \njustifies any strip search of the arrestee. \n \nDefendant  was not required to have  reasonable  suspicion to stri p \nsearch  any arrestee detai ned for a crime involving weapons, vi olence or \ncontraband, or who has a  prior record of convicti ons or unresolved arrests \n5 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 51      Filed 01/23/2008     Page 11 of 31\n \nfor  felonies,  or for crimes involv ing  weapons, viol ence  or contraband, \nbecause the nature of such charges or  prior criminal history alone provides \nreasonable suspicion constitutionally justifying a visual body cavi ty search.  \nSee Defendant's Brief at pp. 8-9 (citi ng Powell v. Barrett , 496 F.3d 1288, \n1310 (11th Cir. 2007); Tardiff v. Knox County, 365 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2004); \nSmith v. Montgomery County , 643 F. Supp. 435,  439 (D.Md. 1986)).  See  \nalso  Hicks v. Moore ,  422 F.3d 1246, 1252 (11th  Cir.  2005); Masters v. \nCrouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1255 (6th Cir. 1989).  Because these detainees \nhave no potential claims for a violati on of their Fourth Amendment rights, \nthis Court may limit the size of the p roposed class as a matter of law based \nupon the nature of the charges  and/or prior criminal hi story of the pre-tri al \ndetainee.   \nIn  Powell v. Barrett ,  496 F.3d 1288 (11th Cir. 2007), plaintiffs \nchallenged the constitutionality of a county jail’s strip search policy, similar to \nthat  presented by Plaintiffs in this  matter.   In the Court’s discussi on \nregarding  whether reasonabl e  suspicion  existed to   search certain class \nmembers,  the Court recognized that  a  person charged with a crime of \nviolence is sufficient to evoke reasonable suspicion that the person may be \nconcealing weapons or contraband.  Powell , 496 F.3d at 1311.  The Court \nopined that “where a person is arrested  for an offense involving weapons or \n6 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 51      Filed 01/23/2008     Page 12 of 31\n \ndrugs – such as possessi on or use of  a firearm and possession, use, or \ndistribution of an illegal substance – it is objectively reasonable to conduct a \nstrip  search of that person before he comes into contact with other \ndetainees.”   Id.    The Court concluded that  the  nature of a charge itself, \nindependent of the facts  surrounding the arrest, gi ves rise to reasonable \nsuspicion.  Id.   \nDefendant urges that the Court  adopt the holding of Powell , and the \nother cases cited above, that a jailer need not have reasonable suspicion to \nstrip  search a pretrial   detainee arres ted  for a crime involving weapons, \nviolence  or contraband, or who has  a  prior record of convictions or \nunresolved arrests for felonies, or for crimes involving weapons, violence or \ncontraband,  because such arrest or crim inal  history, as a matter of law, \nprovides reasonable suspicion.  Consistent with those cases, Defendant has \noffered an alternate class definition that does not include detainees charged \nwith the types of offenses or with the criminal history outlined in Powell.  See \nDefendant's Brief at p. 11. \n7 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 51      Filed 01/23/2008     Page 13 of 31\n \nb.  Defendant  can establish reasonable \nsuspicion  for the strip search of pretrial \ndetainees based upon an objective review  \nof  the circumstances, rath er  than a \nsubjective  review of the reasons that \nsearches were conducted. \n \n  Contrary to Plaintiffs' exhortations,  it is irrelevant whether Defendant's \nactual justifications for the strip search of putative class members arose from \nthe nature of their charges or their prior crimi nal history.  Rather, the Court \nshould  examine \"whether, given the ci rcumstances,  reasonable  suspicion \nobjectively  existed  to justify the search.\"  Powell ,  496 F.3d at 1310 \n(emphasis  in original).  T he  distinction  between a government actor's \nsubjective  motivations and the objecti ve  criteria arisi ng  from the \ncircumstances is a well-recognized tenet of American constitutional law.   \n  The  United States Supreme Court has made clear, time and time \nagain,  that an examination of the  constitutional  reasonableness of a \ngovernment  search rests on an objecti ve,  after-the-fact analysis of the \ncircumstances, rather than a subj ective review of the act ual basis for the \naction.   This principle has been es pecially  well enunciated in cases \nexamining the reasonable required to justify governmental searches.   \nIn  Terry v. Ohio ,  392 U.S. 1, 21-22 (196 8),  the Supreme Court \nemphasized the objective aspect of the  term “reasonable” in its examination \nof the constitutionality of pat-down searches by police officers: \n8 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 51      Filed 01/23/2008     Page 14 of 31\n \nThe  scheme of the Fourth Am endment  becomes meaningful \nonly when it is assured that at some point the conduct of those \ncharged with enforcing the laws  can be subjected to the more \ndetached,  neutral scrutiny of a  judge  who must evaluate the  \nreasonableness of a particular search or seizure in l ight of the \nparticular circumstances. And in  making that assessment it is  \nimperative  that the facts be ju dged  against  an objective \nstandard; would the facts available to the offi cer at the moment \nof  the seizure or the search   ‘warrant a man of reasonable \ncaution in the belief’ that the action taken was appropriate? \n \nSince Terry, the Court has made clear that the \"objective\" justifications \nfor  a search that may later becom e  apparent need not conform to the \n\"subjective\" justifications that were apparent at the time: \nWe have since held that the fact  that the officer does not have \nthe state of mind which is hypothecated by the reasons which \nprovide  the legal justifi cation  for the officer' s  action does not \ninvalidate the action taken as long as the circumstances, viewed \nobjectively, justify that action  . . . The Courts of Appeal s which \nhave  considered the matter have  likewise  generally  followed \nthese principles, first examining the challenged searches under \na  standard of obj ective  reasonableness  without regard to the \nunderlying intent or motivation of the officers involved. \n \nScott v. U.S., 436 U.S. 128, 138 (1978).  See also  Whren v. U.S., 517 U.S. \n806, 813 (1996) (\"Subjecti ve intentions play no role i n ordinary, probable-\ncause  Fourth Amendment analysis.\"); U.S. v. Leal ,  235 Fed. Appx. 937, \n2007 WL 1655658 (3d Cir.  2007) (\"Law enforcement  officers have broad \nleeway  to conduct s earches  and sei zures  regardless  of whether thei r \nsubjective intent corresponds to the legal  justifications for their actions if the \nlegal justification is objectively grounded.\"); U.S. v. Jones, 657 F. Supp. 492, \n9 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 51      Filed 01/23/2008     Page 15 of 31\n \n497  (W.D.Pa. 1987) (\"We look at the obje ctive  facts, not at the officers' \nsubjective intent: even if the police o fficers' professed reason for the search \nis  incredible or i nsufficient,  the search wi ll  be legal if the objecti ve \ncircumstances known to the officers would have justified a reasonable officer \nin taking these actions.\") (citing United States v. Hawkins, 811 F.2d 210, 215 \n(3d Cir.1987)).   \n  These same objective criteria sh ould be applied when examining the \nreasonableness of a jailer's strip search of a pretrial detainee.  See Powell v. \nBarrett, 496 F.3d 1288, 1310 (11th Ci r. 2007); Hicks v. Moore , 422 F.3d \n1246, 1252 (11th Cir. 2005); Evans v. Stephens , 407 F.3d 1272, 1280 n. 9   \n(11th Cir. 2005).  As stated by the court in Hicks: \n[T]he question we are faced with  here is not whether a specifi c \narresting  officer  or jailer act ually  and subj ectively  had the \npertinent  reasonable suspicion,   but whether, given the \ncircumstances,  reasonable susp icion  objectively  existed  to \njustify  such a search.  T hat  no  one, at the time, actual ly \nconducted a \"reasonable suspici on\" analysis is unimportant to \nwhether  reasonable suspicion obj ectively  existed,  given the  \ncircumstances.   The subjective intentions and beliefs of the \njailers conducting the strip search  are immaterial to the Fourth \nAmendment analysis. \n \nHicks, 422 F.3d at 1252. \nPlaintiffs ignore this well-established body of law, instead arguing that \nPowell, and its application of the \"objective criteria\" standard to strip search \ncases, \"has been ostensibly ignored by the majority of Federal courts,\" and \n10 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 51      Filed 01/23/2008     Page 16 of 31\n \nthat  Defendant cannot rel y  on \"post hoc \"  demonstrations of reasonable \nsuspicion as to some purported class memb ers.  Plaintiff's Brief at p. 7-8.   \nPlaintiffs,  however, point to absolutely no case law   that supports thei r \ncontention that the law in the contex t of strip searches  should depart from \nthe  uniform precedent of our Fourth  Amendment  jurisprudence  to focus \ninstead  on the subjective justifications   of corrections officers who stri p \nsearch pretrial detainees.   \nPlaintiffs  contend that governmental   consideration of the obj ective \ncriteria of the charges and criminal  history of an arrestee was rejected in \nDavis  v. County of Camden ,  657 F .  Supp. 396,  400-401  (D.N.J. 1987).   \nDavis, however, involved an individual plai ntiff's claim that she was illegally \nstrip-searched.   T here,  the \"defendant s  candidly admit that the county \nofficers  had no reasonable suspi cion  that the plaintiff was concealing \nweapons or contraband.\"  Distinguishing the facts from Smith, supra, a class \naction where the court had held that an arrestee's charges or criminal history \ncould justify a strip search, the Davis court noted: \nIn Smith, a class action, defendants  never conceded that they \nharbored no actual suspicion with respect to any plaintiffs; to the \ncontrary,  they persistently asserted that they had probabl e \ncause to search every person that  had opted in to the cl ass.  \nThe Smith court . . . did  not . . . hold that once a determination \n \n11 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 51      Filed 01/23/2008     Page 17 of 31\n \nhas been made that a parti cular arrestee does not present a \ndanger, a search may proceed nonetheless. \n \nDavis, 657 F. Supp. at 400.  The Davis  decision, therefore, rested on the \nspecific  fact that the jai l  administrators  had admitted that they had no \nreasonable suspicion as to the individual plainti ff.  To the extent that the \n1\nDavis decision thereafter criticized what it called a \"blanket risk approach\"   \njustifying the strip search of class action plaintiffs based on their charges or \ncriminal  history, such holdi ng  is di cta,  and further is contrary to Powell , \nWhren, and the other cases cited above.   \n  Plaintiffs cite to two cases that held that a particular drug arrest did not \ncreate reasonable suspicion sufficient to justify a strip search of the arrestee.  \nPlaintiffs' Brief at p. 9 (c iting Way v. County of Ventura , 445 F.3d 1157, \n1161-1162 (9th Cir. 2006) and D odge v. County of Orange , 209 F.R.D. 65, \n76-77 (S.D.N.Y. 2002)).  These decisions are outliers, which run contrary to \nthe consensus established above, and, further,  both ignore the recognized \ninterests of jail officials to prevent the smuggling of contraband into their \nprisons and the need for br ight-line rules to allow effective enforcement of \njail policies.  See  Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 559; Smith , 643 F. Supp. at 437.   \n                                                 \n1\n  Contrary to Plai ntiffs'  assertions,  courts  have not uniformly criticized or \ninvalidated  the \"blanket ri sk  approach.\"   To the contrary, D efendant's \nresearch  has uncovered only two opinions that even reference thi s \napproach.  \n12 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 51      Filed 01/23/2008     Page 18 of 31\n \nNone of the other cases ci ted by Plaintiffs address whether an arrestee's \ncharge or prior criminal history could provide constitutionally valid objective \ncriteria to justify a strip search. \nc.  Defendant's  strip searches of significant \nportions of the putative class were based \nupon  objectively  reasonable criteria, and \ntherefore did not violate the Constitution. \n \nBased upon the objective factors of   the nature of th e  charge for a \ndetainee and a detainee’ s prior criminal history, it can be concluded that \nreasonable suspicion existed to strip search many of the detainees included \nin Plaintiffs' putative class.   Clearly, this is a purely legal determination, one \nthat this Court may make at this ti me as a m atter of law based upon the \nclass  definition as alleged in Plaint iffs’  Amended Complaint.  Plainti ffs’ \nproposed class definition includes persons as to whom reasonable suspicion \nexisted, arising by the very nature of  the crime the person was charged or \ntheir past criminal history, i.e. th ose detainees whose  charges upon intake \nimplicated  either weapons or drugs, or   who had a past conviction for a \nfelony,  drug or weapons  charge.   Because Plai ntiffs’  proposed class \nincludes these detainees, it is overbroad as a matter of law. \nMoreover, although Plaintiffs allege  that the County has a pol icy of \nstrip-searching all pre-trial detainees, such all egation, even if proven to be \ntrue,  does not necessarily   result  in a viol ation  of each class member’s \n13 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 51      Filed 01/23/2008     Page 19 of 31\n \nconstitutional rights.  The mere fact that a detainee undergoes a strip search \nat a jail that had a blanket strip se arch policy does not mean that every \nsearch  conducted actual ly  violated the Constituti on.   See ,  e.g.,  Hicks v. \nMoore, 422 F.3d 1246, 1251 (11th Cir. 2005 ).  Therefore, even assuming \nthat the averments in Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint are true, such a policy \nwould not necessarily result in violati ons of the consti tutional rights of all \npersons strip searched.  Rather, if r easonable suspicion objectively existed \nthat the pre-trial detainee is conc ealing contraband, that detai nee cannot \nestablish that the strip search was a viol ation of his/her constitutional rights.  \nThus, the Court may obj ectively determine at this stage of the proceedi ngs \nthat Dauphin County had reasonabl e suspicion to search certain pre-trial \ndetainees, as outlined above, and that such a determination may be based \nupon the nature of the detainee’s charges and/or prior criminal history. \n3.  Discovery  is Not N ecessary  to Determine That \nPlaintiffs’  Putative Class is Overbroad as A  \nMatter of Law. \n \nPlaintiffs  contend that di scovery  must be completed before any \ndetermination regarding class size is made.  Plaintiffs are mistaken.  The \ndetermination that the Plai ntiffs’ proposed class is overbroad as presently \ndefined is a matter of l aw.  For example, there are no facts which could be \ndiscovered which would resu lt in a finding that a  searching officer lacked \n14 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 51      Filed 01/23/2008     Page 20 of 31\n \nreasonable suspicion to search a pre -trial detainee who was arrested on a \ndrug  charge.  Thus, no discovery is   necessary to determine whether \nPlaintiffs’  putative  class should be s ubstituted  with Defendant's proposed \ndefinition of class members. \n  Indeed, Plaintiffs have not denied or  refuted the fact that many of the \nputative members of their proposed class, as presently drawn, are arrestees \nwho have been detained for a crime  involving weapons or contraband, or \nwho have a prior record of convi ctions or unresolved arrests for felonies or \nfor  misdemeanors involvi ng  weapons  or  contraband.  As to these \nindividuals,  Defendant, as a matter of   law, possessed obj ective  criteria \ncreating  reasonable suspi cion  sufficient  to  justify their strip search upon \nadmission to Dauphin County Prison.   No further discov ery is required to \nestablish that Plaintiffs' proposed class is too broadly drawn, and that these \nindividuals have no actionable claims against Defendant.   \nPlaintiffs,  in fact, suggest that  they  may l ater  voluntarily agree to \nnarrow their class to the limi ts proposed by Defendant: \"Plaintiffs may even \nconsent…that  certain categori es  should be excluded from the class \ndefinition.”   (Doc. 45, p. 10).  Plai ntiffs  nonetheless c ontend  that further \ndiscovery  should  be taken as to putative cl ass  members  with no legal ly \ncognizable claims (as outlined above and in Powell ).  Allowing such further \n15 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 51      Filed 01/23/2008     Page 21 of 31\n \ndiscovery only would result in needless expense to the parties and a waste \nof judicial resources.   \nDefendant therefore requests that Plaintiffs' Complaint be dismissed to \nthe extent that its proposed class definition encompasses putati ve members \nwithout  legally  cognizable claims, and that Plainti ffs'  proposed class \ndefinition be accordingly amended as set fo rth in Defendant's initial  brief.  \nSee Defendant's Brief at p. 11. \n4.  Plaintiffs  Have the Burden to Prove That Their \nConstitutional Rights Were Violated. \n \nPlaintiffs contend that Defendant is  not entitled to dismissal based on \nthe existence of reasonable suspicion as  to putative members of the overly \nbroad class because the existence of reasonable suspicion is an affirmative \ndefense, as to which the burden of proof  is on Defendant.  Plaintiffs' Brief at \np. 7-8.   \nPlaintiffs'  contention  is incorrect   because the determinati on  of \nreasonable suspicion should be made as a matter of law, with respect to the \ndetainees described above.  Moreover, it  is important to note that a plaintiff \nin a Section 1983 action has the burden to prove a violation of a civil right \nsecured by the C onstitution or federal law and must show that the all eged \ndeprivation  was committed by a person acti ng  under color of state law.   \nGroman v. Township of Manalapan , 47 F.3d 628, 633 (3d Cir. 1995).  This \n16 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 51      Filed 01/23/2008     Page 22 of 31\n \nstandard has been applied to various constituti onal claims brought pursuant \nto Section 1983 in this jurisdiction.  See  Edwards v. Philadelphia, 860 F.2d \n568 (3d Cir. 1988) (plaintiff has the burden where the alleged deprivation i s \nthe use of excessive force); Hill v. Borough of Kutztown , 455 F.3d 225, 241 \n(3d Cir. 2006) (plaintiff has the burden in a First Amendment retaliation claim \nbrought pursuant to Section 1983).  The burd en, therefore, is on Plaintiffs to \nestablish that Defendant's al leged searches of the putative class members \nwere in violation of the Fourth Amendment. \nIn support of their argument in opposition, Plaintiffs fi rst cite to two \ncases from other jurisdictions, Curry v. City of Syracuse , 316 F.3d 324 (2d \nCir.  2003) and Mack v. Suffolk County ,  191 F.R.D. 16 (D. Mass. 2000), \nwhich they construe as placing the burden to establish reasonable suspicion \non  Defendant.  These cases do not  stand  for such a proposi tion  in the \ncontext of a constitutional challenge to a strip search policy pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C.  § 1983.  Additionally, no deci sions  from the Third Ci rcuit  or any \ndistrict court in the Third Circuit following the reasoning of Curry or Mack.    \nIn Curry, the plaintiff brought a claim against  a police officer for false \nimprisonment.  In its discussion regarding the elements of such a claim, the \nCourt noted that a “defendant has t he burden of raisi ng and proving the \naffirmative defense of probable cause.”  Curry , 316 F.3d at 335.  The false \n17 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 51      Filed 01/23/2008     Page 23 of 31\n \nimprisonment claim was brought pursuant to New York state law and it was \nnot  a claim for a United States cons titutional  violation.   There was no \ndiscussion regarding the burden of a Plaint iff in a civil rights acti on brought \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, nor was there any mention of the burden in an \naction  involving a constitutional   challenge  to a strip search policy.   \nFurthermore, in this jurisdiction, courts have held that to prevail  on a false \narrest claim under Section 1983, a plaintiff must demonstrate at trial that the \npolice lacked probable cause.  Groman, 47 F.3d at 634.   \nIn  Mack,  the plai ntiffs  brought a cl ass  action challenging the strip \nsearch policy of the Suffol k County Jail.  After  its determination that class \ncertification was appropriate and after   a finding  that the women plaintiffs \nwere routinely strip-searched, the Co urt stated that the burden then rested \non  the defendants to de monstrate  that the par ticular  searches were \nreasonable.   No such determinatio ns  have been made here to shift the \nburden onto Defendant to prove that reasonable suspi cion existed to strip \nsearch  any indivi duals  searched  under any alleged  strip  search poli cy.  \nThus, Plaintiffs maintain the burden to  prove that their consti tutional rights \nwere violated.   \n18 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 51      Filed 01/23/2008     Page 24 of 31\n \nC.  Plaintiffs’  Amended  Complaint  Clearly  Seeks \nInjunctive  Relief And Name d  Plaintiffs Shepard, \nCarter, And Reynolds, And Putative Class Members, \nDo Not Have Standing To Seek Such Relief. \n \nPlaintiffs contend that “[n]o request for [injunctive] relief is . . . presently \npending” and it attempts to dissuade the Court from a “complicated standing \nquestion” at this juncture.  (Doc. 45, p. 9).  Plaintiffs’ contention that they do \nnot seek injunctive relief is untrue.   At paragraph 4 of the prayer for relief \nportion  of their Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs seek, “[a] prelim inary  and \npermanent  injunction  enjoining De fendant  County of D auphin  from \ncontinuing  to stri p  and visual ca vity  search indi viduals  charged with \nmisdemeanors or minor crimes absent particularized, reasonable suspicion \nthat  the arrestee subjected to t he  search is conc ealing  weapons or \ncontraband.”  (Doc. 24, p. 14).   \nDefendant  requests that thi s  Court di smiss  the claim   for inj unctive \nrelief filed on behalf of Plaintiffs Reynolds, Sheppard and Carter because the \nAmended Complaint is completely devoid of a claim that any of the three is \nlikely to be subjected to a strip sear ch again in Dauphin County.  Glaringly, \nPlaintiffs’  Amended Complaint does include an averment that “there i s  a \npossibility  beyond mere specul ation”  that any of th e  plaintiffs other than  \nPlaintiff McCormick will again be subjec ted to a strip searc h.  (Doc. 24, ¶ \n38).  Without averring that Plainti ffs Shepard, Reynolds , and Carter, and \n19 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 51      Filed 01/23/2008     Page 25 of 31\n \nputative class members will be subjected to the complained of conduct in the \nfuture, i.e. a strip search at the Prison, those Plaintiffs do not have standing \nto seek injunctive relief.  See City of Los Angeles v. Lyons , 461 U.S. 95, 75 \nL. Ed.2d 675, 103 S. Ct. 1660 (1983).  \n  Plaintiffs  further argue that na med  Plaintiffs and putative class \nmembers  have standing to seek i njunctive  relief because the “si tuation \npresented to the Court is the quintess ential example of one that is capable \nof  repetition,  yet avoidi ng  review.”   (Doc.  45, p. 12).  Perhaps not as \nconcerned with any future relief of c urrently unrepresented parties, or their \nunwillingness to engage in such a “complicated” standing analysis, Plaintiffs \nbriefly  refer to case law from other  jurisdictions  which issued decisions \ncontra to the decision issued by the United States Supreme Court in Lyons .  \nPlaintiffs confuse the mootness doctri ne in their discussion of standing and \nincorrectly apply the doctrine to their discussion of whether named Plaintiffs \nand putative class members have standing to seek injunctive relief.   \nStanding  inquires whether \"someo ne  is the proper party to bring a \nlawsuit at the begi nning of the case.\"  Artway v.  Attorney Gen. of N.J. , 81 \nF.3d 1235, 1246 (3d Cir. 1996).  \"The three elements necessary to establish \nthe irreducible constitutional minimum of standing are: (1) the pl aintiff must \nhave suffered an i njury in fact - an i nvasion of a legal ly protected interest \n20 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 51      Filed 01/23/2008     Page 26 of 31\n \nwhich  is (a) concrete and particulari zed  and (b) actual or imminent, not \nconjectural  or hypothetical;  (2) there  is  a causal connection between the \ninjury and the conduct com plained of; and (3) it must be likely, as opposed \nto  merely speculative, that the in jury  will be redressed by a favorable \ndecision.\"  Taliaferro v. Darby Twp. Zoning Bd ., 458 F.3d 181, 188 (3d Cir. \n2006) (citation omitted).  Mootness has been described as \"the doctri ne of \nstanding set in a ti me frame: The requisite personal interest that must exi st \nat the commencement of the litigati on (standing) must continue through its \nexistence (mootness).\"  Rosetti v. Shalala, 12 F.3d 1216, 1224 n.19 (3d Cir. \n1993)  (citation  omitted).  \"A central   question  in determining m ootness  is \nwhether a change in the ci rcumstances since the beginning of the liti gation \nprecludes any occasion for meaningful relief.\"  Surrick v. Killion , 449 F.3d \n520, 526 (3d Cir. 2006) (citation omitted). \n  Here, named Plaintiffs Shepard,  Reynolds, and Carter, and putative \nclass  members, did not have standing to   recover at the outset of this \nlitigation.  Thus, the mootness doctrine is inapplicable.  Moreover, under the \n“capable  of repeti tion”  exception to   the mootness doctrine as argued by \nPlaintiffs, a court may exercise its juri sdiction and consider  the merits of a \ncase that would otherwise be deemed moot when, “(1) the challenged action \nis, in its duration, too short to be fully litigated, and (2) there is a reasonable \n21 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 51      Filed 01/23/2008     Page 27 of 31\n \nexpectation  that the same complaining  party  will be subj ect to the same  \naction  again.”  Spencer v. Kemna ,  523 U.S. 1, 17, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 \nL.Ed.2d 43 (1998).  Even assuming,  arguendo, that the mootness doctri ne \napplies  as Plaintiffs contend (which Defendant contends is an incorrect \nanalysis),  the “capable of repetition”  exception  cannot provide recovery \nbecause  the Amended Complaint failed to   allege that Plaintiffs Shepard, \nReynolds, and Carter, and putative class members, will be subject to strip \nsearches at the Prison again.  Defendant  urges this Court to follow Lyon s \nand  conclude that named Plaintiffs  Shepard,  Reynolds, and Carter, and \nputative  class members, cannot obtain   injunctive reli ef  based upon the \naverments of the Amended Complaint. \n   \n22 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 51      Filed 01/23/2008     Page 28 of 31\n \nWHEREFORE,  for the reasons se t  forth hereinabove, Defendant, \nCounty of Dauphin, hereby  requests that this Honorable grant its Motion to \nDismiss and enter the proposed order.  \n         Respectfully  submitted, \n       Lavery,  Faherty, Young & Patterson, P.C.  \n \nDate: January 23, 2008     By: /s/ Frank J.

Introduction \nOn behalf of the Settlement Class certified for settlement purposes by the Court \non April 8, 2009, Plaintiffs Jennifer Reynolds, Ashley McCormick, and Devon Shepard \nand Class Counsel hereby move, together with Defendant, Dauphin County, for final \napproval of the class action settlement, including an award of counsel fees, expenses, and \nincentive payments to the Class Representatives. Class Counsel respectfully suggests to \nthe  Court  that  the  $2,160,500.00  settlement  of the  Class  Members'  claims  against \nDauphin County provides Class Members with excellent relief for this case and should be \napproved by the Court. \nII.  Procedural Background \nThis case was commenced in September 2007 by the filing of a complaint. The \nparties engaged in extensive discovery, including serving and responding to \ninterrogatories and document requests, reviewing hundreds of documents, conducting \nnumerous depositions, and interviewing fact witnesses. After the completion of discovery \nbut before a class certification motion was filed, the parties agreed to enter into \nsettlement discussions.  Settlement negotiations began in July 2008, when the parties met \nfor a mediation session conducted by Judith Meyer, Esquire.  The Settlement Agreement \nwas executed January 26,2009. \nPlaintiffs moved for preliminary approval on January 28,2009 and the Court \nprovided preliminary approval of the Settlement Agreement on April 8, 2009.  Notice \nwas then mailed to the Class Members and notice was published in accordance with the \nSettlement Agreement.  Additional notice efforts were also undertaken.  See LaDuca \nCert. ~4; LaDuca Cert. Ex. A (Affidavit of Jose C. Fraga) at ~~3-4, 6-7.  Class Members \nhad until September 29,2009 to file claims.  A total of2,288 claims have been received \n1 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 74-3      Filed 09/30/2009     Page 11 of 41\n(of which 527 appear to have been from individuals not preliminarily identified as being \nvalid Class Members).  LaDuca Cert. Ex. A at ~9. Also, there has not been a single \nrequest for exclusion from the Settlement and only one objection was received.  LaDuca \nCert. at ~13.  Plaintiffs now move for final approval of the Settlement and all its \nconstituent parts. \nIII.  Terms of the Settlement and Settlement Administration \nThe proposed  Settlement Class consists of all persons brought to  the  County \nPrison after being charged with misdemeanor offenses (or other minor crimes) and were \nsubsequently  strip  searched upon their entry into  the  Prison pursuant to  the  policy, \ncustom and practice of the County of Dauphin (the \"Settlement Class\"): \nAll persons who have been or will be placed into the custody of the Dauphin \nCounty Prison after being charged with misdemeanors, summary offenses, \nviolations of probation or parole or intermediate punishment, civil commitments, \nor minor crimes who were strip searched upon their entry into the Dauphin \nCounty Prison pursuant to the policy, custom and practice of the County of \nDauphin.  The class period commences on September 16, 2005 and extends to \nMarch 12,2008.  Specifically excluded from the class is Defendant and any and \nall of its respective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs, successors, employees \nor aSSIgnees. \nThe settlement creates a fund of $2,160,500.00 (the \"Settlement Fund\").  All \nadministrative  expenses,  including  the  costs  of settlement  administration,  website \nadministration and the provision of notice to Class Members, as well as the amounts \nawarded by the Court for attorneys'  fees  and costs and incentive award to the Class \nRepresentatives (in the requested amount of $15,000 to Reynolds and McCormick, and \n$10,000 to Shepard), will be deducted from the Settlement Fund prior to determining the \namount of distribution for Class Members. I  In the event that the pro rata share of the \n1 The precise recovery from the Settlement Fund to Class Members, and the timing of distributions, will be \ndetermined by the Plan of Distribution. Members of the Settlement Class will then receive their pro rata \n2 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 74-3      Filed 09/30/2009     Page 12 of 41\nsettlement paid to Class Members would be greater than $1,400.00, the Defendant's \ninsurance  company,  States  Self-Insurers  Risk  Retention  Group,  Inc.,  will  receive  a \nreverter of all remaining funds. \nPursuant to the Court's preliminary approval order, the Settlement Administrator \n(1)  mailed  notice  of the  settlement (the  \"long  form  notice\")  to  all  members  of the \nSettlement Class, (2) placed a summary of the long-form notice (the \"short-form notice\") \nin the Harrisburg Patriot News at least one day per week for three consecutive weeks and \non one occasion during the last ten days of the claims period.  Advertisements were also \nbroadcast on television on four separate weeks.  See LaDuca Certification Exhibit A \n(Fraga  Affidavit)  ~4.  In  addition,  at  Class  Counsel's  request,  Garden  City  also \nestablished an Interactive Voice Response system which received 2,483 calls.  All told, \n8,779 Claim Packets were mailed (including reminder and duplicate mailings).  See \nLaDuca Certification Exhibit A (Fraga Affidavit) ~8. \nClass Counsel made supplemental efforts to increase the claims rate.  Individuals \nwho had not responded to the initial mailing for whom Garden City was able to obtain \nvalid telephone numbers received a pre-recorded message reminder, see LaDuca Cert. \nExhibit A (Fraga Affidavit) ~6), and a reminder mailing was sent to Class Members with \ndeliverable addresses that included a reminder of the upcoming claims deadline, as well \nas another set of claims forms.  See LaDuca Cert. Exhibit A (Fraga Affidavit) ~7. \nThe claims period concluded on September 29, 2009.  A total of 2,288 Claim \nForms have been received (527 of which have been identified as not being from valid \nClass Members - that is, from individuals for whom there is not a Dauphin County Jail \nshare ofthe distribution amount which counsel believes, based on claims data set forth in the Affidavit of \nJose C. Fraga, will be less than the $1,400 maximum amount permitted under the Settlement Agreement, \nsee SA at I1I(C)(I), (3). \n3 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 74-3      Filed 09/30/2009     Page 13 of 41\nbooking sheet showing that individual is a class member).  LaDuca Cert. Ex. A (Fraga \nAffidavit) ~9.  This is a claims rate of 34%, id, which is within the typical rate of return \nof claims in strip search class actions.2 \nNotably, not a single individual has opted-out of the settlement and only one \nperson has objected to it.  Based on the number of claims received, Settlement Class \nMembers will receive approximately $680 as their pro rata share of the Settlement Fund. \nSee LaDuca Cert. ~5.  As a consequence, Class Counsel believes that there will be no \nreverter arising from this Settlement. \nIV.  Standards and Procedures for Final Approval of Class Action Settlements \n\"Compromises of disputed claims are favored by the courts.\"  Williams v.  First \nNat 'I Bank, 216 U.S. 582, 595 (1910); In re Prudential Ins.  Co.  of Am. Sales Practices \nLitig., 148 F.3d 283,317 (3d Cir. 1998) (\"Prudential 11').  Settlement spares the litigants \nthe uncertainty, delay and expense of a trial, while simultaneously reducing the burden on \njudicial resources. \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \nmandates that a class action cannot be settled without court approval: \nA  class  action  shall  not  be  dismissed  or  compromised \nwithout  the  approval  of the  court,  and  notice  of the \nproposed dismissal  or compromise  shall  be  given to  all \nmembers of the class in such manner as the court directs. \nSee Amchem Prods. Inc. v.  Windsor,  521 U.S. 591, 617 (1997); Prudential II, 148 F.3d at \n316.  In a class action, the \"court plays the important role of protector of the [absent \nmembers'] interests, in a sort of fiduciary capacity.\"  In re Gen.  Motors Corp.  Pick-up \n2 Plaintiffs' initial estimate of the class size was 5,721. A thorough review of the class size data revealed, \nhowever, that the Settlement Class actually consists of 6, 618 individuals.  Considering only the valid \nclaims received to date, the claims rate is approximately 27%. \n4 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 74-3      Filed 09/30/2009     Page 14 of 41\nTruck Fuel Tank Prods.  Liab.  Litig., 55  F.3d 768,  785  (3d Cir.  1995).  The ultimate \ndetermination whether a proposed class action settlement warrants approval resides in the \ncourt's discretion.  Protective Comm. For Indep.  S'holders ofTMT Trailer Ferry, Inc.  v. \nu.s. \nAnderson, 390  414, 424-25  (1968);  Approval of a settlement is warranted if the \nsettlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate.  Fry v. Hayt, Hayt & Landau, 198 F.R.D. 461, \n470 (E.D. Pa. 2000); In re Cendant Corp. Litig., 264 F.3d 201, 231 (3d Cir. 2001). \nWhile the Court has discretion in determining whether to approve a settlement, it \nshould be hesitant to substitute its judgment for that of the parties who negotiated the \nsettlement.  Fisher Bros.  v.  Phelps Dodge Indus.,  Inc., 604 F. Supp. 446, 452 (E.D. Pa. \n1985).  \"Courts judge the fairness of a proposed compromise by weighing the plaintiff's \nlikelihood of success on the merits against the amount and form of the relief offered in the \nsettlement.  They do not decide the merits of the case or resolve unsettled legal questions.\" \nCarson v. Am. Brands, Inc., 450 U.S. 79,88 n.14 (1981) (citation omitted). The court may \nrely on the judgment of experienced counsel and should avoid transforming the hearing on \nthe settlement into a trial on the merits.  Bryan v.  Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co., 494 F.2d \n799,804 (3d Cir. 1974). \nThe procedure of providing notice to the class, followed by a hearing to consider \napproving  a  class  settlement,  is  now  standard  practice  in  this  Circuit,  as  well  as \nthroughout the Country.  Prudential II, 148 F.3d at 326-27; see also Bronson v. Board of \nEducation of the City School District of the City of Cincinnati, 604 F.  Supp. 68  (S.D. \nOhio 1984). \nThis Court previously granted preliminary approval of the Settlement, signifying \nthat the Settlement was in the range of possible approval. However, the ultimate Rule \n5 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 74-3      Filed 09/30/2009     Page 15 of 41\n23(e) determination is reserved pending the completion of the notice and initial opt-out \nprocess, so the Court can consider input from the Class Members who will be bound by \nthe final approval Order.  See General Motors, 55 F.3d 768; In re Corrugated Container \nAntitrust Litigation,  643  F.2d  195  (5th  Cir.  1981);  Armstrong  v.  Board  of School \nDirectors oft he City ofM  ilwaukee, 616 F.2d 305 (7th Cir. 1980).  Now that a full plan of \nnotice has  been effectuated and  the  deadline  for  objections  and  opt-outs period has \npassed, the Court may consider final approval of the Settlement. \nThe Third Circuit has identified nine factors - the Girsh factors - that a district \ncourt should  consider when determining  whether a proposed  class  action settlement \nwarrants approval.  In re Datatec Systems, 2007 WL 4225828, *2 (citing Girsh, 521 F.2d \nat 157).  These include: \n(1) the complexity, expense and likely duration of the litigation; \n(2) the reaction of the class to the settlement; (3) the stage of the \nproceedings and the amount of discovery completed; (4) the risks \nof establishing liability; (5) the risks of establishing damages; (6) \nthe risks of maintaining the class action through the trial; (7) the \nability of the defendants to withstand a greater judgment; (8) the \nrange of reasonableness of the settlement fund in light of the best \npossible  recovery;  (9)  the  range  of  reasonableness  of  the \nsettlement fund to a possible recovery in light of all the attendant \nrisks of litigation. \nSee  also  In  re  Rite Aid Corp.  Sec.  Litig.,  396  F.3d  294,  301  (3d  Cir.  2005).3  The \n3 The Girsh factors are not exhaustive, however, and the Third Circuit has advised that the District \ncourt may consider other relevant factors in determining whether [mal approval should be granted. In re \nAT & T Corp., 455 F.3d 160, 165 (3d Cir.2006) (citing In re Prudential Ins. Co. America Sales Practice \nLitigation Agent Actions, 148 F.3d 283,323 (3d Cir.1998».These may include, e.g.: \n[T]he maturity of the underlying substantive issues, as measured by the experience in \nadjudicating individual actions, the development of scientific knowledge, the extent of \ndiscovery on the merits, and other factors that bear on the ability to assess the probable \noutcome of a trial on the merits of liability and individual damages; the existence and \nprobable outcome of claims by other classes and subclasses; the comparison between the \nresults achieved by the settlement for  individual class or subclass members and the \nresults achieved-or likely to be achieved-for other claimants; whether class or subclass \n6 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 74-3      Filed 09/30/2009     Page 16 of 41\nSettlement before the Court in this case falls well within the range of possible approval, \ntaking  into  consideration  all  relevant  factors,  and,  therefore,  final  approval  of the \nSettlement should be granted. \nA.  Application of the Girsh Factors \n1.  Complexity, Expense and Likely Duration of the Litigation \nIf this  litigation were to proceed,  significant expense  and  delay  would result \nwhich  likely  would  not  benefit  Class  Members.  As  stated  above,  the  discovery \nconducted in this case has been significant.  If Plaintiffs were to continue to trial, the \nremaining discovery would be complex and expensive.  Moreover, there would be full \nbriefing on a motion for  class  certification and,  potentially,  dispositive  motions that \nwould take more time.  Even beyond the dispositive motions, pretrial activities would \ntake additional time and, should it be reached, a trial in this action would last for weeks, \nwith multiple jail employees being examined about the practices of the Dauphin County \nJail  in  an  effort  to  establish  municipal  liability.  The  Settlement  removes  the \noverwhelming and redundant costs of individual trials.  Indeed, if certification is not \ngranted, even having a small proportion of Class Members have duplicative trials on this \nissue would be an enormous waste of judicial resources, and would not be the superior \nand appropriate way to resolve this controversy. \nmembers are accorded the right to opt out of the settlement; whether any provisions for \nattorneys' fees are reasonable; and whether the procedure for processing individual claims \nunder the settlement is fair and reasonable. \nPrudential IL 148 F.3d at 323. \n7 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 74-3      Filed 09/30/2009     Page 17 of 41\n2.  The Absence of Objections is Evidence of the Reasonableness \nof the Settlement \nIt is clear that a pro rata share of the distribution amount, which is approximately \n$680 per Settlement Class member for the indignity at issue, is quite fair and reasonable, \ngiven the inherent risks of litigation and consistent with the awards in similar cases. \nAs described above, the notice has been given to the Class.  One objection was \nreceived and no individuals excluded themselves from the Settlement.  When determining \nthe measure of the class's reaction to a settlement, the court must look to the number and \n\"vociferousness\" of the objectors.  General Motors, 55 F.3d at 812.  Here, the response of \nthe Class represents a reliable barometer of the overall fairness of the Settlement itself. \nSee Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Bolger, 2 F.3d 1304, 1313 n.15 (3d Cir. 1993). \nAdditionally,  the  number  of claims  filed  on  the  Settlement  IS,  as  noted, \ncommensurate with, or greater, than claims rates in other strip search cases.  Here, the \ncurrent claims rate is 34% (or, approximately 27% considering only those claims which \nthe claims administrator has identified as being valid), see LaDuca Cert. Exhibit A (Fraga \nAffidavit) ~9, a rate within the range of strip search settlements.  See  Chart of Strip \nSearch Settlements, attached hereto as Exhibit A.  The fact that the Class Members \nresponded and made claims at such a rate, coupled with the fact that there have been no \nopt-outs and only one objector, shows that the reaction of the Class to the proposed \nsettlement has been overwhelmingly positive.  See, e.g. In re Datatec Systems, 2007 WL \nu.s. \n4225828, *3 (citing Stoetzner v.  Steel Corp., 897 F.2d 115, 118-19 (3d Cir.  1990) \n(finding that 29 objectors out of 281 Class Members \"strongly favors settlement\"); In re \nSmithKline Beckman Corp. Sec. Litig., 751 F. Supp. 525, 530 (E.n. Pa. 1990) (\"Both the \nutter absence of objections and the nominal number of shareholders who have exercised \n8 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 74-3      Filed 09/30/2009     Page 18 of 41\ntheir right to  opt out of this  litigation  militate  strongly in favor  of approval  of the \nsettlement.\"). \n3.  Stage of the Proceedings and the Amount of Discovery \nCompleted \nThis factor requires the Court to analyze the stage of the proceedings to determine \n\"the degree of case development that ... counsel have accomplished prior to the \nsettlement.  General Motors, 55 F.3d at 813.  Essentially, the Court must ensure that the \nSettlement is not the product of a quick and uniformed decision making process.  It has \nbeen generally understood by the Third Circuit that settlements made after discovery \nreflect the true value ofthe claim.  Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Bolger, 2 F.3d 1304, 1314 (3d \nCir. 1993).  Here, Class Counsel took numerous depositions and reviewed hundreds of \ndocuments.  Thus, this factor likewise weighs in favor of approval. \n4.  Risks of Establishing Liability and Establishing Damages \nThe Court must determine whether the proposed Settlement is within a range \nwhich experienced attorneys could accept in light of the relevant risks of the litigation. \nGeneral Motors, 55 F.3d at 806.  Here, as noted, the settlement range is well within that \nobtained  in other,  similar cases and  was,  as  set forth  below,  obtained  by  attorneys \nexperienced in this particular area of practice. \nIn addition, there has been the creation of some uncertainty in the law regarding \nwhether visual strip searches violate the United States Constitution and while district \ncourts in this Circuit have found such liability to exist, attempts are being made to take \nthe issue to the Third Circuit.  See Florence v.  County ofB  urlington, Civ. Action No. 05-\n3619  (D.N.J.).  Further,  given  the  credibility jurors  often  give  to  law  enforcement \ntestimony and the fact that it would have been difficult for Plaintiff to prove and recover \n9 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 74-3      Filed 09/30/2009     Page 19 of 41\ndamages for harms that were often dignitary rather than pecuniary, Class Counsel faced a \nrisk of a low damage award.  There are risks associated with trying this case before a jury \nin that there would be \"no guarantee whom the jury would believe.\"  In re Cendant Corp. \nLitig., 264 F.3d 201, 239  (3d Cir.  2001).  Thus, this factor also weighs in favor  of \napproval of the settlement. \n5.  Risk of Maintaining the Class Action Through the Trial \nAfter the Supreme Court's opinion in Amchem, 521 U.S. 591 (1997), this factor \n\"may not be  significant to  a  court's  determination  of the  approval  of a  settlement. \nPrudential II, 148 F.3d at 321.  Particularly because this is a settlement class, this factor \nadds little to the consideration of the fairness of the settlement.\" In re Safety Components \nInc. Sec. Litig., 166 F. Supp. 2d 72, 91 (D.N.J.2001).  Here, in any event, the Class was \nnot certified for litigation purposes, only for  settlement, though the risk of obtaining \ncertification and maintaining it, however, was real.  See In re Warfarin Sodium Antitrust \nLitig., 391 F.3d 516,537 (3d Cir. 2004). \n6.  Ability of the Defendants to Withstand Greater Judgment \nThis Girsh factor \"is concerned with whether the defendants could withstand a \njudgment for an amount significantly greater than the settlement.\"  Cendant, 264 F.3d at \n240.  Plaintiffs believe that the Settlement constitutes the limits of Defendant's ability to \npay and  could only have been concluded with the use of insurance money Dauphin \nCounty. \n7.  Range of Reasonableness of the Settlement Fund in Light of \nthe  Best  Possible  Recovery  and  the  Attendant  Risks  of \nLitigation \nThe fairness of the settlement process and of the Settlement Agreement itself also \n10 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 74-3      Filed 09/30/2009     Page 20 of 41\nwas shaped by the experience and reputation of counsel, an important factor in final \napproval of class action settlements.  See General Motors, 55 F.3d at 787-88; Cotton v. \nHinton,  559  F.2d  1326  (5th  Cir.  1977);  In  re  Coordinated Pretrial Proceedings  in \nAntibiotic Antitrust Actions, 410 F. Supp. 659 (D. Minn.1974) (\"The recommendation of \nexperienced antitrust counsel is entitled to great weight. \");  Fisher Brothers v.  Phelps \nDodge Industries, Inc., 604 F. Supp. 446 (E.D. Pa. 1985) (\"The professional judgment of \ncounsel involved in the litigation is entitled to significant weight. \").  This Settlement was \nspecifically negotiated by experienced counsel to meet all the requirements of Rule 23 as \ndiscussed in Amchem, and specifically to provide administrative procedures to assure all \nClass Members equal and sufficient due process rights.  Accordingly, the Settlement was \nnot  the  product  of collusive  dealings,  but,  rather,  was  informed  by  the  vigorous \nprosecution of the case by the experienced and qualified counsel.  Further, continued \nlitigation would be long, complex and expensive, and a burden to court dockets.  Lake v. \nFirst National Bank, 900 F. Supp. 726 (E.D. Pa. 1995) (expense and duration oflitigation \nare factors to be considered in evaluating the reasonableness of a settlement). \nThere is no reason to doubt the fairness of the proposed Settlement Agreement. \nThe  Settlement  Agreement  was  the  result  of months  of good  faith,  arm's  length \nnegotiations between experienced and informed counsel on both sides.  The proposed \nSettlement  Agreement  does  not  unduly  grant  preferential  treatment  to  the  Class \nRepresentatives or to segments of the Settlement Class, and it does not provide excessive \ncompensation  to  Counsel.  Moreover,  as  noted,  courts  have  approved  class  action \nsettlements paying victims of illegal strip searches in the range likely to be paid here. \nThus, the Settlement Agreement gives Class Members the benefit of a significant amount \n11 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 74-3      Filed 09/30/2009     Page 21 of 41\nof compensation, comparable to  analogous  cases, without having to prove particular \nemotional distress or the particular circumstances of a search.  Those who believed they \nwould have been entitled to  significantly more could, of course, have opted out and \npursed an independent remedy - and none chose that alternative.  The Settlement here is \nfair and on par with other settlements in similar cases. \nB.  The Plan of Distribution of the Settlement Fund is Fair \nThe \"[a]pproval of a plan of allocation of a settlement fund in a class action is \n'governed by the same standards of review applicable to approval of the settlement as a \nwhole: the distribution plan must be fair, reasonable and adequate. '\"  In re Ikon Office \nSolutions, Inc.  Sec.  Litig.,  194 F.R.D.  166, 184 (E.D. Pa. 2000) (citations omitted); see \nalso Walsh v.  Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co., 726 F.2d 956,964 (3d Cir.1983) (\"The Court's \nprincipal obligation is simply to ensure that the fund distribution is fair and reasonable as \nto all participants in the fund.\"). \nThe Plan of Distribution (Exhibit C to LaDuca Cert.) provides that Class Counsel \nwill seek to be reimbursed for costs and attorneys' fees of no more than thirty percent of \nthe  Settlement Fund.  Class  Counsel  proposes  that  $40,000  be  allocated to  pay  an \nincentive award to Class Representatives Jennifer Reynolds,  Ashley McCormick, and \nDevon Shepard.  After these costs and the costs of notice and claims administration, \napproximately $1,198,650 will be available to distribution on a pro rata basis to the class, \nwhich will, based upon claims to date, most likely be an amount of approximately $680 \nper class member.  See LaDuca Cert. ~ 5; LaDuca Cert. Ex. C. \nClass Counsel believes that the Plan of Distribution is eminently fair, reasonable, \nand adequate. \n12 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 74-3      Filed 09/30/2009     Page 22 of 41\nC.  Class Counsels' Request for Reimbursement of Expenses \nShould Be Approved \n\"Counsel  for  a  class  action  IS  entitled to  reimbursement of expenses \nthat were adequately documented and reasonably and appropriately incurred \nin the prosecution of the class action.\"  In re Datatec Systems, 2007 WL 4225828, \n*9 (quoting In re Safety Components, Inc.  Sec.  Litig., 166 F. Supp. 2d 72,  108 (D.N.J. \n2001)); In re Rent-Way Sec. Litig., 305 F. Supp. 2d 491,519 (W.D. Pa. 2003) (\"There is \nno doubt that an attorney who has created a common fund for the benefit of the class is \nentitled to reimbursement of. .. reasonable litigation expenses from that fund.\"). \nClass Counsel requests reimbursement of expenses in the amount of $18,700 to \ncover costs associated with legal research, travel, mediation, meals, transportation, court \nfees, mailing, postage, and telephone.  These reasonable expenses are documented on the \nbooks of Class Counsel and are reasonable in relation to the Settlement Fund and should \nbe awarded.  LaDuca Cert. at ~5, 18.  See Lan v.  Ludrof, 2008 WL 763763 (W.D. Pa. \nMarch 21, 2008) (reimbursement of expenses in the amount of $66,080.81); Rent-Way, \n305 F. Supp. 2d at 519 ($283,907 awarded in expenses); Lazy Oil Co. v.  Witco Corp., 95 \nF. Supp. 2d 290,324 (W.D. Pa. 1997) ($486,165). \nD.  The Incentive Award to the Class Representatives Should Be \nApproved \nThe  Settlement  Agreement  provides  for  an  incentive  award  for  Class \nRepresentatives  Reynolds  and  McCormick of $15,000,  and  for  Class  Representative \nShepard of $10,000.  The Class Representatives provided support to this litigation by \nagreeing to step forward to serve as the Class Representatives, providing responses to \ndiscovery requests, and making themselves available to be deposed.  The awards to the \n13 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 74-3      Filed 09/30/2009     Page 23 of 41\nClass Representatives are exceedingly modest, reasonable and should be approved. The \nlaw recognizes that it is appropriate to make modest awards in the range of $1,000 to \n$20,000 in recognition of the services that such plaintiffs perform in a successful class \naction. See In re Insurance Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 2007 WL 2916472, *8 ($10,000 \nincentive award to each plaintiff, resulting in total payment of $250,000); Lazy Oil, 95 F. \nSupp. 2d  at 345, 324-25 (incentive awards of $5,000 to $20,000 awarded); Godshall v. \nFranklin Mint Co., 2004 WL 2745890, *4  (E.D. Pa. Dec.  1, 2004) ($20,000 to each \nnamed plaintiff); In re Linerboard Antitrust Litig., 2004 WL 1221350, *18-19 (E.D. Pa. \nJune 2,  2004) (granting award of $25,000 to  each of the five  class representatives); \nRoberts v. Texaco, 979 F. Supp. 185,205 (S.D.N.Y. 1997); Genden v. Merrill Lynch, 700 \nF.

Class Counsels' Request for Attorneys' Fees Is Reasonable and \nShould be Approved by the Court \nPursuant to  Rule  23(h)  and  Rule  54(d)(2),  Class  Counsel  seeks  an award  of \nattorneys' fees  and costs in the amount of $648,150.00, or 30% of the common fund \ncreated by the  Settlement.  After extensive negotiation,  Defendant agreed to  pay this \namount of the fund as attorneys' fees and not oppose Class Counsel's application. \nThis Court uses the \"percentage-of-recovery\" method in determining attorneys' \nfee awards in common fund cases, subject to a \"lodestar/multiplier\" cross-check.

Supp. 2d at 322-23; Lan, 2008 \n14 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 74-3      Filed 09/30/2009     Page 24 of 41\nWL 763763, *18; In re Datatec System, 2007 WL 4225828, *6.  The Third Circuit has \nidentified several factors that a district court should consider in detennining an award of \nattorneys' fees. These factors include: \n(1)  the  size  of the  fund  created  and  the  number  of persons \nbenefitted; (2) the presence or absence of substantial objections by \nmembers of the class to the settlement tenns and/or fees requested \nby counsel; (3) the skill and efficiency of the attorneys involved; \n(4) the complexity and duration of the litigation; (5) the risk of \nnonpayment;  (6)  the  amount  of time  devoted  to  the  case  by \nplaintiff's counsel; and (7) the awards in similar cases. \nRite Aid, 396 F.3d at 301 (citing Gunter v.  Ridgewood Energy Corp., 223 F.3d 190, 195 \nn. 1 (3d Cir. 2000).  Each of these factors favors the requested award of attorneys' fees. \nFirst,  the fund created by the Settlement is  $2,160,500.00 and the Settlement \nClass consists of6,618 individuals.  LaDuca Cert. Ex. A (Fraga Affidavit) at '5,9.  The \nSettlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate, and the Settlement Class is large.  This factor \ntherefore weights in favor of granting the fee request.  See,  e.g., Erie County Retirees' \nAss'n., 192 F. Supp. 2d at 381  (\"Fee awards ranging from thirty to forty-three percent \nhave been awarded in cases with funds ranging from $400,000 to $6.5 million ... \"). \nSecond, as noted above, Class Members received notice of the Settlement tenns \nand the amount of attorneys' fees that Class Counsel would be applying for.  Only one \nobjection has been filed with respect to the reverter in particular and, as noted previously, \nin light of the high claims rate, it is believed that no reverter will take effect.  Further, no \nClass Members have opted out of the Settlement.  Accordingly, this factor too favors the \nrequested attorneys' fee award.  See,  e.g.,  In re AT&T Corp., 455 F.3d at 170 (district \ncourt did not abuse discretion in finding that second factor weighed strongly in favor of \napproval where there were 8 objections out of one million potential class members). \n15 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 74-3      Filed 09/30/2009     Page 25 of 41\nThird, the Class is represented by experienced counsel who have invested time \nand resources into the prosecution of this action and have served as Class Counsel in \nnumerous class actions including strip search class actions.  \"The fact that not a single \nobjection has been filed to the Settlement ... is strong evidence that counsel for the Class \nhave achieved a very good result for the Class.\" Lan, 2008 WL 763763, *23. \nFourth,  the  duration  of this  litigation  also  weighs  in  favor  of the  award  of \nattorneys' fees.  Counsel have litigated this case for over two years.  There is no doubt \nthat \"[t]he Settlement saves the parties substantial time and money.\"  In  re Datatec \nSystems, 2007 WL 4225828, *7. \nFifth, the risk of nonpayment is significant.  Class Counsel \"undertook this action \non a contingent fee basis, assuming a substantial risk that they might not be compensated \nfor their efforts.  Courts recognize the risk of non-payment as a factor in considering an \naward  of attorneys'  fees.\"  In  re  Datatec Systems,  2007  WL  4225828,  *7  (citation \nomitted). \nSixth, Class Counsel have committed approximately 1,252.45 hours through the \ncourse of this litigation to date, all of which was devoted on a contingency basis with no \nguarantee of repayment.  LaDuca Cert. at ~15. \nLastly, the requested percentage of the Settlement Fund of 30% is commensurate \nwith other settlements.  For example, the fee request approved in Suggs v.  Cumberland \nCounty, 1:06-CV-00087 (D.N.J.), was 30% of the $4.5 million in that case and also 30% \nin Boiselle v.  Mercer County, 3 :06-CV -2065, ($1.8 million settlement).  See also, Hicks \nv.

Apr. 26, 1995) \n(approving award equal to 33.3% of the $4.375 million settlement fund and noting that \n\"cases with smaller settlement funds often include attorneys' fee awards that exceed the \nmedian of 25  percent\").  \"The fact that the requested fee  represents a percentage of \nrecovery at or below the traditional range for similarly situated settlements ... supports the \nconclusion that it is reasonable.\" Lan, 2008 WL 763763, *25. \nCourts confmn the reasonableness of an award based on a percentage of recovery \n17 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 74-3      Filed 09/30/2009     Page 27 of 41\nby using the lodestar method.  Rite Aid, 396 F.3d at 305-06.  The lodestar analysis is \nperformed by \"multiplying the number of hours reasonably worked on a client's case by a \nreasonable hourly billing rate for such services based on the given geographical area, the \nnature of the services provided, and the experience of the attorneys.\"  Id.  at 305. The \nCourt \"should apply blended billing rates that approximate the fee  structure of all the \nattorneys who worked on the matter.\" Id. at 306. If the lodestar multiplier, which is equal \nto the proposed fee award divided by the produce of the total hours and the billing rate, is \nlarge, the award calculated under the percentage-of-recovery method may be deemed \nunreasonable, and the Court may consider reducing the award. Id. The lodestar multiplier, \nhowever, \"need not fall within any pre-defmed range, provided that the [d]istrict [c ]ourt's \nanalysis justifies the award.\"  Id. at 307. \"The court is not required to scrutinize every \nbilling record but may, instead, rely on summaries submitted by the attorneys, and is not \nrequired to scrutinize every billing record.  Id, 396 F.3d at 306-07. \n\"Multiples ranging from  one to  four are frequently  awarded in common fund \ncases when the lodestar method is applied.\"  Prudential II,  148 F.3d at 341 (quoting 3 \nHerbert Newberg &  Alba Conte, Newberg on  Class Actions,  §14.03  at  14-5  (3d ed. \n1992); In re  Vicuron Pharmaceuticals,  Inc.

Supp.  2d at 517; In  Re \nNASDAQ Market-Makers Antitrust Litig.,  187 F.R.D. 465, 489 (S.D.N.Y. 1998). Here, \nconsidering  the  approximate  hourly  attorneys'  fees  to  date,  Class  Counsel  seeks  a \nmultiplier of approximately 1.25 based upon the total lodestar time to date of $518,112.5, \nsee LaDuca Cert. at ~~15, 17, which is, as shown, is in the lower to middle range of \ntypical awards.  However, in all likelihood there will be extensive additional time in order \n18 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 74-3      Filed 09/30/2009     Page 28 of 41\nto oversee the settlement and to handle a significant volume of calls from class members \nthat will add at least 10% to the current lodestar, which will reduce the multiplier to 1.11, \nid., a number well within the range of reasonability, and particularly for a case in which \nthe class's reaction has been overwhelmingly positive. \nClass Counsel respectfully suggests that the counsel fee requested is reasonable \nin light of the time and labor expended by counsel, the magnitude of the litigation, the \nrisks taken in the litigation, the monetary results achieved for the class, and the amount of \nthe fee  in proportion to the monetary settlement and injunctive relief achieved.  It is \nparticularly reasonable because Class Counsel should be rewarded, not penalized, for \nrecognizing the  strengths and weaknesses of the  case and  for  being able to  settle it \nquickly so as to obtain recompense for the Class, sooner rather than later. \nv. \nCertification of the Proposed Settlement Class is Appropriate to Resolve All \nStrip Search Claims Against Defendants \nThe benefits of settlement classes are well-recognized.  See Amchem, 521  U.S. \n591; Prudential II,  148 F.3d 283; Hanlon v.  Chrysler Corp.,  150 F.3d 1011  (9th  Cir. \n1998).  The Third Circuit has a clear preference for class certification: \"The interests of \njustice require that in a doubtful case . . . any error, if there is to be one, should be \ncommitted in favor of allowing a class action\"  Eisenberg v.  Gagnon, 766 F.2d 770 (3d \nCir. 1985); see also Walsh v. Pittsburgh Press Co., 160 F.R.D. 527 (W.D. Pa. 1994). \nWhile the elements of Rule 23 are set forth below seriatim, it is worth noting that \nthis Court, and other federal courts, in considering the situation where cities or counties \nhave  employed blanket search policies have consistently recognized the propriety of \ncertifying such cases as class actions and the decisions certifying such cases are legion.4 \n4 See Delandro v. County ofA llegheny, Civ. No. 06-927 (W.D. Pa. Aug. 8,2008) (class certification in strip \n19 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 74-3      Filed 09/30/2009     Page 29 of 41\nA.  The Elements of Rule 23(a) are Satisfied in the Present Case \nIn order for a lawsuit to be maintained as a class action under Rule 23  of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, the named plaintiff or plaintiffs must establish each of \nthe four threshold requirements of subsection (a) of the Rule, which provides: \nOne or more members of a class may sue or be sued as \nrepresentative parties on behalf of all only if (1) the class is \nso numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; \n(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class; \n(3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are \ntypical of the claims or defenses of the class; and (4) the \nrepresentative parties will fairly and adequately protect the \ninterests of the class. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  See e.g. Barnes v. American Tobacco Co., 161 F.3d 127 (3d Cir. \n1998); Prudential II, 148 F.3d at 308-09; Wetzel v.  Liberty Mut. Ins.  Co., 508 F.2d 239 \n(3d Cir. 1975).  Here, all four elements easily are satisfied. \n1.  Numerosity Under Rule 23(a)(I) \nRule 23(a)(I) requires that the class be \"so numerous that joinder of all members \nis impracticable.\"  A plaintiff is not required to come before the Court and detail, to the \nperson, the exact size of the class or to demonstrate that joinder of all Class Members is \nimpossible.  \"Impracticability does not mean impossibility.\" Liberty Lincoln Mercury, \nsearch class action against county); Wilson v.

Corp.,  149 F.RD. 65, 73 (D.N.J. 1993) (\"precise enumeration of the \nmembers of a class is not necessary.\"); Zinberg v.  Washington Bancorp, Inc.,  138 F.R.D. \n397, 405 (D.N.J. 1990) (\"It is proper for the court to accept common sense assumptions \nin order to support a finding of numerosity.\"); Moskowitz v.  Lopp,  128 F.RD. 624, 628 \n(E.D.  Pa.  1989).  Numerosity  is  indisputable  here.  During  the  course  of the  case, \nDefendants produced booking records for individuals charged with misdemeanor or other \nminor offenses during the Class period.  Notice was mailed to thousands of individuals \nand numerosity is thus not at issue.  See e.g.  Bowers v.  City of Philadelphia, 2006 WL \n2818501, *2-3 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 28, 2006) (numerosity exists where over 300 individuals \nhad allegedly been subjected to unconstitutional conditions at PPS facilities and where \nthe proposed class, which includes future detainees, could include thousands of people); \nMarriott, 227 F.RD. at 171  (numerosity found in strip search class action where class \nnumbered over 2,000). \n2.  Commonality Under Rule 23(a)(2) \nRule 23(a)(2) requires that there be \"questions of law or fact  common to the \nclass.\"  The commonality requirement is met if Plaintiff s grievance shares a common \nquestion of law or of fact.  Baby Neal v.  Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 56 (3d Cir. 1994).  Rather \nthan requiring that all questions of law or fact be common, Rule 23  only requires that \n\"the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any \nquestions affecting only individual members.\" Fed. R  Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  A plaintiff is not \nrequired to show that all Class Members' claims are identical to each other as long as \nthere are common questions at the heart of the case; \"factual differences among the \nclaims of the putative Class Members do not defeat certification.\"  Baby Neal, 43 F.3d at \n21 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 74-3      Filed 09/30/2009     Page 31 of 41\n56; Prudential II,  148 F.3d 283.  Indeed, a single common question is sufficient to satisfy \nthe requirements of Rule 23(a)(2).  See H  Newberg & A.  Conte,  1 Newberg on Class \nActions § 3.10, at 3-50 (1992); accord Baby Neal,  43 F.3d at 56.  A party is entitled to \ncertification where the class claims arise \"from a 'common nucleus of operative fact' \nregardless of whether the underlying facts fluctuate over the class period and vary as to \nindividual claimants.\" In re Asbestos Sch. Litig., 104 F.R.D. 422, 429 (B.D. Pa. 1984). \nApplying these principles, it becomes manifest that the commonality requirement \nof subsection (a)(2) is easily met here.  The central issues posed by this litigation are:  a) \ndid Defendant have an blanket strip search policy and/or practice during the class period; \nb) did that policy rise to the level of violating the United States Constitution; and, if so, c) \nis Defendant responsible for the constitutional violations?  Given the presence of these \ncommon questions central to this litigation, Rule 23(a)(2)'s requirement for the existence \nof common questions of fact or law has been met here.  See Florence, supra;  Wilson, \nsupra. 5 \n3.  Typicality Under Rule 23(a)(3) \nRule 23(a)(3) requires that the representative plaintiff's claims be \"typical\" of \nthose of other Class Members.  The commonality and typicality requirements of Rule \n23(a) \"tend to merge\" Gen.  Tel.  Co.  of Southwest v.  Falcon, 457 U.S.  147,  157 n.13 \n(1982).  The requirement of this subdivision of the rule,  along with the adequacy of \n5  See also, e.g., Dodge, 226 F.R.D. at 180-181 (commonality exists where all members of the class contend \nthat a blanket strip search policy exists, where all members contend that the policy is illegal, and where all \nmembers of the class claim they were searched pursuant to the policy which was unifonnly applied to all \ndetainees); Marriott, 227 F.R.D. at 172 (finding commonality where the representative parties and the \nmembers of the proposed class had the same legal claims based upon the same official procedure); see also \nSutton v. Hopkins County,  2007 WL 119892, *4 (W.D. Ky. Jan. 11,2007) (\"Plaintiffs have alleged that the \nDefendants had a policy, custom, or practice of strip-searching persons on admission to and/or just prior to \nrelease from the Hopkins County Jail without regard to whether there existed the requisite individual, \nreasonable suspicion required by law. Given this allegation, the existence and constitutionality of the \ncounty's policy, custom or practice are common questions.\"). \n22 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 74-3      Filed 09/30/2009     Page 32 of 41\nrepresentation requirement set forth in subsection (a)(4), is designed to assure that the \ninterests of unnamed class members will be protected adequately by the named class \nrepresentative.  Id; Prudential II, 148 F.3d at 311; Bogosian v. Gulf Oil Corp., 561 F.2d \n434 (3d Cir.  1977); Asbestos School Litigation, 104 F.R.D. at 429-30.  The typicality \nrequirement \"is satisfied when each class member's claim arises from the same course of \nevents, and each class member makes similar legal arguments to prove the defendant's \nliability.\"  Marisol A. v.  Giuliani, 126 F.3d 372 (2d Cir.1997).  \"Factual differences will \nnot render a claim atypical if the claim arises from the same event or practice of course of \nconduct that gives rise to the claims of the Class Members, and it is based on the same \nlegal theory.\"  Hayworth v. Blondery Robinson & Co., 980 F.2d 912,923 (3d Cir. 1992). \nTypicality is demonstrated where the plaintiff can \"show that two issues of law or fact he \nor she shares in common with the class occupy the same degree of centrality to his or her \nclaims as to those of unnamed Class Members.\"  Weiss v.  York Hosp., 745 F.2d 786,809-\n10 (3d Cir. 1984); see also Blihovde, 219 F.R.D. at 617 (applying this principle to a strip \nsearch class action).  The typicality requirement has been liberally construed by the \nfederal courts.  Scholes v.  Stone,  McGuire & Benjamin,  143 F.R.D. 181, 185 (N.D. Ill. \n1992). \nHere, the Representative Plaintiffs' claims are typical of the claims of the Class. \nThese claims arise from the  same course  of events and the Representative Plaintiffs \nwould have to make the same or effectively the same arguments to prosecute his claim as \nwould be made by members of the proposed Class.  Typicality is satisfied because the \n\"[D]efendants acted pursuant to a policy that called for indiscriminate searches.  If this \nallegation is true, then the named [P]laintiffs would be similarly situated to the other \n23 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 74-3      Filed 09/30/2009     Page 33 of 41\nmembers of the class.\"  Blihovde, 219 F .R.D. at 617.  Thus, typicality is easily satisfied \nby this proposed class action.  See Bowers, 2006 WL 2818501, *2-3 (\"A plaintiffs claim \nis typical if it arises from the same event or course of conduct that gives rise to the claims \nof other Class Members and is based on the same legal theory.\"); see also Weisfeld v Sun \nChern.  Corp., 210 F.R.D.  136, 140 (D.N.J. 2002) (\"[I]n instances wherein it is alleged \nthat the defendants engaged in a common scheme relative to all members of the class \nthere is a strong assumption that the claims of the representative parties will be typical of \nthe absent Class Members.\") (citation omitted); Marriott,  227 F.R.D.  at 172 (fmding \ntypicality even where the claims of the representative parties involved a more detailed \nsearch than other Class Members, because they were conducted pursuant to the same \npolicy);  Sutton,  2007  WL  117892,  at  *4  (\"Because each named Plaintiff alleges  an \nunconstitutional strip search after arrest for a minor violation or before release from jail, \nthe claims of the representatives are typical of the class as a whole.\"). \n4.  Adequacy Under Rule 23(a)(4) \nThe  final  requirement  of Rule  23(a)  is  set  forth  in subsection  (a)(4),  which \nrequires that ''the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of \nthe class.\" The Third Circuit consistently has ruled that: \nAdequate representation depends on two factors:  (a) the \nplaintiffs  attorney  must  be  qualified,  experienced  and \ngenerally able to conduct the proposed litigation; and (b) \nthe plaintiff must not have interests antagonistic to those of \nthe class. \nWeiss, 745 F.2d at 811, quoting Wetzel v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., 508 F.2d at 247; \nsee also Prudential II, 148 F.3d at 312.  These two components are designed to ensure \nthat absentee Class Members' interests are fully pursued.  The existence of the elements \n24 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 74-3      Filed 09/30/2009     Page 34 of 41\nof adequate  representation  are  presumed  and  \"the  burden  is  on  the  defendant  to \ndemonstrate that the representation will be inadequate.\"  Asbestos School Litigation, 104 \nF.R.D. at 430, citing Lewis v.  Curtis, 671 F.2d 779 (3d Cir. 1982); Cook v. Rockwell Int'I \nCorp., 151 F.R.D. 378 (D. Colo. 1993) (quoting 2 Newburg, §7.24 at pp. 7-81,2-82). \nPlaintiffs and  Class Counsel have fairly  and adequately represented the Class \nhere, especially judging by the excellent settlement achieved in this litigation.  Indeed, in \nthe present case, the presumption of adequate representation cannot be rebutted.  With \nrespect to the issue of adequacy of counsel, the Court may take judicial notice of the fact \nthat Plaintiffs'  attorneys have substantial experience in litigating complex civil rights \nactions.  See LaDuca Cert. ~19.  The Class is represented by competent and experienced \ncounsel who have invested considerable time and resources into the prosecution of this \naction.  Additionally, counsel in this action has served as Class Counsel in numerous strip \nsearch class actions, and have been held to be adequate counsel repeatedly,  Inasmuch as \nClass Counsel are adequate under Rule 23(a)(4), the effectively parallel requirements of \nRule 23(g) are also met for the same reasons as those set forth immediately above. \nCounsel have taken significant discovery that has enabled them to negotiate an \nadvantageous settlement on behalf of the Class.  Class Counsel negotiated the proposed \nsettlement from a position of knowledge and strength, and as advocates for the entirety of \nthe class.  They have satisfied this requirement for certification. \nAs  to  the  second  issue,  there  is  nothing  to  suggest  that  the  Representative \nPlaintiffs have significant interests antagonistic to those of the absent Class Members in \nthe vigorous pursuit of the class claims against Defendant.  See Dietrich v.  Bauer,  192 \nF.R.D. 119, 126 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (\"gauging the adequacy of representation requires an \n25 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 74-3      Filed 09/30/2009     Page 35 of 41\nassessment whether the class representatives have interests antagonistic to those of the \nclass they seek to represent\").  The  Representative Plaintiffs  have come forward  to \nrepresent the Class under great personal pressure - as being subject to a situation as \nhumiliating as a strip search and then being forced to relive it would be difficult for \nanyone.  Plaintiffs'  \"interests in this case coincide with those  of the potential Class \nMembers in that [Plaintiffs seek] a declaration that the practices, policies, and conditions \ncomplained of in the [Class Action] Complaint are unconstitutional and seek injunctive \nrelief prohibiting the continuation of those\" policies.  Bowers, 2006 WL 2818501, *6-8. \nIndeed, Plaintiffs have obtained an advantageous settlement that treats all Class Members \nin the same fashion, and provides real value to all.  . \nHaving demonstrated that each of the mandatory requirements of Rule 23(a) are \nsatisfied here, Plaintiffs now turn to consideration of the factors which, independently, \njustify class treatment of this action under subdivision 23(b)(3) of the rule. \nB.  The Requirements of Rule 23(b) (3) Are Met in the Settlement Context \nPlaintiffs' proposed class also meet the requirements of Rule 23(b)(3).  Under \n23(b)(3) a class action may be maintained if: \nthe court finds that the questions of law or fact common to \nthe members of the class predominate over any questions \naffecting only individual members, and that a class action is \nsuperior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of the controversy.  The matters pertinent to \nthe findings  include:  (A) the interest of members of the \nclass in individually controlling the prosecution or defense \nof separate  actions;  (B)  the  extent  and  nature  of any \nlitigation concerning the controversy already commenced \nby or against members of the class; (C) the desirability or \nundesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims \nin the particular forum;  (D) the  difficulties  likely to  be \nencountered in the management of a class action. \n26 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 74-3      Filed 09/30/2009     Page 36 of 41\nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). \n\"The Rule  23(b) (3) predominance  inquiry tests  whether proposed classes  are \nsufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.\"  Amchem, 521 U.S. at \n623.  Although Rule 23(b)(3) requires that common issues oflaw and fact predominate, it \ndoes not require that there be an absence of any individual issues. In re Sugar Industry \nAntitrust Litig., 73 F.R.D. 322, 344 (E.D. Pa. 1976).  The Court must find that \"the group \nfor  which  certification  is  sought  seeks  to  remedy  a  common  legal  grievance. \" \nHochschuler v.  G.D. Searle & Co., 82 F.R.D. 339 (N.D. Ill. 1978); Dietrich, 192 F.R.D. \n119 (in determining whether common issues of fact predominate, \"a court's inquiry is \ndirected primarily toward whether the issue of liability is common to members of the \nclass\").  Rule 23(b) (3) does not require that all questions of law or fact be common.  See \nIn re Telectronics Pacing Systems, Inc.,  172 F.R.D. 271, 287-88 (S.D. Ohio 1997).  In \nthis regard, courts generally focus on the liability issues and if these issues are common \nto the class, common questions are held to predominate over individual questions.  See id \nHere, the proposed Class Members'  claims involve one central legal question: \nwas the strip searching of every pretrial detainee admitted to the Dauphin County Jail \nwithout  regard  to  the  crime  charged  or the  circumstances  of arrest,  constitutional? \nPlaintiffs' claims also share common factual issues - did this practice exist during the \nclass period and is the Defendant legally responsible for such practices?  Proof of these \nissues, with a goal to answering the two core legal questions, would be the undoubted \nfocus of any trial.  Clearly, legal and factual issues in this litigation predominate over any \nof the Plaintiff's individual issues. \nGiven the nature of this action and the fact that a substantial proportion of the \n27 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 74-3      Filed 09/30/2009     Page 37 of 41\nClass  membership  is  comprised of economically disenfranchised  individuals,  a  class \naction is also the superior method by which to  adjudicate claims of individual Class \nMembers.  Poor and marginalized Class Members are unlikely to be able to litigate their \ncases individually.  See Mack v. Suffolk County,  191 F.RD. 16,25 (D. Mass. 2000); In re \nNassau County Strip Search Cases, 461 F.3d 219, 230 (2d Cir. 2006); Tardiff, 365 F.3d \nat 7 (\"class status here is not only the superior means, but probably the only feasible one \n... to establish liability and perhaps damages\").  The class action device is designed for \nthe situation where an individual seeks to vindicate \"the rights of groups of people who \nindividually would be without effective strength to bring their opponents into court at \nall.\"  Amchem,  521  U.S.  at  617.  \"The policy at the very  core  of the  class  action \nmechanism is to overcome the problem that small recoveries do not provide the incentive \nfor any individual to bring a solo action prosecuting his or her rights.  A class action \nsolves  this  problem  by  aggregating  the  relatively  paltry  potential  recoveries  into \nsomething worth someone's  (usually  an  attorney's)  labor.\"  Mack,  191  F.RD. at  25 \n(internal citations omitted); Yang v.  Odum, 392 F.3d 97,  106 (3d Cir. 2004); Marriott, \n227 F.R.D. at 173; Sutton, 2007 WL 119892, *9 (\"litigating the existence of a uniform \npolicy for the class as a whole would both reduce the range of issues and promote judicial \neconomy.\")(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \nConsiderations of judicial economy underscore the superiority of the class action \nmechanism in this case.  The prosecution of this case as a class action is superior to \nthousands  of individual  cases  being  filed  in  this  Court,  each  of which  would  be \nrepetitious and possibly yield inconsistent adjudications.  See Califano v.  Yamaski,  42 \nU.S. 682, 700-701 (1979); Dodge, 226 F.RD. at 183 (\"Where a single issue (such as the \n28 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 74-3      Filed 09/30/2009     Page 38 of 41\nexistence of a uniform policy) is guaranteed to come up time and time again, issues of \njudicial economy strongly militate in favor of resolving that issue via a techniques that \nwill bind as many persons as possible.\"); Sutton, 2007 WL 119892, *9 (holding that \"a \nclass action provides the most feasible  and efficient method of determining liability\" \nwhere suit alleges existence if a uniform unconstitutional strip search policy). The trial in \nthis action would last for weeks, with scores of jail employees being examined about the \npractices of the Dauphin County Correctional Facility in an effort to establish municipal \nliability.  Even having a small proportion of Class Members have duplicative trials on \nthis  issue  would be an enormous waste of judicial resources,  and would not be the \nsuperior and appropriate way to resolve this controversy. \nSettlement  on  a  class  basis  also  is  superior  to  individual  litigation  and \nadjudication because settlement provides Class Members with prompt compensation for \ntheir damages, whether those damages exist now or manifest themselves sometime in the \nfuture.  By contrast, compensation resulting from litigation is highly uncertain and may \nnot be received before lengthy trial and appellate proceedings are complete.  In addition, \nthe Settlement obviously removes the overwhelming and redundant costs of individual \ntrials. \nAccordingly, the Settlement Agreement renders a class action superior to other \npotential avenues of recovery for Plaintiffs and the Class.  Therefore, this case presents \nthe  paradigmatic  example  of a  dispute  which  can  be  resolved  to  effectuate  the \nfundamental goals of Rule 23:  (1) to promote judicial economy through the efficient \nresolution of multiple claims in a single action; and (2) to provide persons with smaller \nclaims, who would otherwise be economically precluded from doing so, the opportunity \n29 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 74-3      Filed 09/30/2009     Page 39 of 41\nto assert their rights.  Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal Practice & Procedure: Civil 2d § \n1754.  Moreover, unless Class Members obtain relief through the settlement, most of \nthem will not obtain any relief at all.  It would be inconceivable for every one of the \nthousands of potential plaintiffs to conduct expensive and extensive discovery to prove \nliability under the legal theories proffered in the complaint for a potential individual \nrecovery of damages.  See In re Kirschner Medical Corp. Sec. Litig., 139 F.R.D. 74, 83 \n(D.  Md.  1991) (class suits superior when individual claims are too  small to warrant \nindividual suit).  At the same time, the settlement fully preserves the due process rights of \neach individual plaintiff seeking compensatory damages. \nIn sum, the requirements of Rule 23(b) (3) are satisfied and certification of a the \nproposed class is appropriate. \nVI.  Conclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Joint Motion for Final Approval of Class Action \nSettlement, for an Award of Expenses and Attorneys' Fess, and for Approval of Incentive \nAward to the Class Representative should be granted in its entirety. \nDated: September 30, 2009  Respectfully Submitted By: \nsf  Charles J.

Fraga of the Garden City Group, Inc.; and having heard\narguments from Class Counsel and the Defendant; and having considered the submissions by\nClass Members, THIS COURT, consistent with the opinion announced from the Bench at the\nconclusion of the December 18, 2009 hearing, now makes the following:\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n1.  This action was commenced on September 16, 2007, as a class action.\n2.  After intensive litigation, including extensive discovery and motion practice, and as a\nresult of intensive arm’s length negotiations between Class Counsel and Defendant, including a\nmediation with Judith Meyers, Esq., the parties have reached accord with respect to a\nSettlement that provides substantial benefits to Settlement Class members, in return for a\nrelease and dismissal of the claims at issue in this case against the Defendant (“Settlement\nAgreement”).  The resulting Settlement Agreement was preliminarily approved by the Court on\nApril 8, 2009.\n3.  As part of the Order Granting Preliminary Approval, this Court approved a proposed\nNotice Plan and Class Notice, which provided Settlement Class Members notice of the\nproposed settlement.  The Notice Plan provided an opportunity for Class Members to file\nobjections to the Settlement, and an opportunity to opt out of the Settlement.  As of the\ndeadline for the filing of objections and requests for exclusion set forth in the Notice Plan, one\nobjection was filed and no requests for exclusion were filed.\n2\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 87      Filed 12/18/2009     Page 3 of 7\n4.  By Order dated October 29, 2009, the Court approved a Notice of Revised\nDeadlines, which provided Class Members who may not have received direct mail written\nNotice of the Settlement with such notice.  The Notice of Revised Deadlines provided all Class\nMembers with an extension of time to submit a Claim Form, and provided Class Members who\nmay not have received mailed written Notice of the Settlement with additional time to exclude\nthemselves from the Settlement or object to the Settlement.  As of the deadline for the filing of\nobjections and requests for exclusion set forth in the Notice of Revised Deadlines, no requests\nfor exclusion were received and no additional objections were made.\n5.  Given the size of this Settlement, the Notice Plan, and Revised Notice of Settlement\ndescribed above, this Court finds that the submission of only one objection to the settlement,\nwhich concerned a reversionary clause that will not be triggered, is indicative of the fairness,\nreasonableness and adequacy of the Settlement with Defendant.\n6.  The settling parties have filed with the Court two affidavits from Joseph C. Fraga\ndeclaring that the mailing of the Court-approved notice, consistent with the Notice Plan and the\nNotice of Revised Deadlines, has been completed.\n7.  The Court finds that the published notice, mailed notice, and Internet posting\nconstitute the best practicable notice of the Fairness Hearing, proposed Settlement, Class\nCounsels’ application for fees and expenses, and other matters set forth in the Class Notice\nand Short Form Notice; and that such notice constituted valid, due, and sufficient notice to all\n3\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 87      Filed 12/18/2009     Page 4 of 7\nmembers of the Settlement Class, and complied fully with the requirements of Rule 23 of the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Constitution of the United States, the laws of\nPennsylvania, and any other applicable law.\n8.  Any persons who wished to be excluded from this action were provided an\nopportunity to “opt out” pursuant to the Notice, but no persons excluded themselves.\n9.  Settlement Class Members are bound by the Settlement, Settlement Agreement,\nreleases contained within the Settlement Agreement, and this Final Order and Judgment. \nSettlement Class Members do not have a further opportunity to opt out of this Action.\n10.  Any Class Member who did not timely file and serve an objection in writing to the\nSettlement Agreement, to the entry of Final Order and Judgment, or to Plaintiffs’ Class\nCounsels’ application for fees, costs, and expenses, in accordance with the procedure set forth\nin the Class Notice and mandated in the Order Granting Preliminary Approval of Settlement, is\ndeemed to have waived any such objection by appeal, collateral attack, or otherwise.\n11.  On the basis of all of the issues in this litigation, and the provisions of the\nSettlement Agreement, the Court is of the opinion that the Settlement is a fair, reasonable and\nadequate compromise of the claims against the Defendant in this case, pursuant to Rule 23 of\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  There are a number of factors which the Court has\nconsidered in affirming this Settlement, including:\na.  The liability issues in this case have been vigorously contested.\n4\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 87      Filed 12/18/2009     Page 5 of 7\nb.  This Settlement has the benefit of providing relief to Class Members now,\nwithout further litigation, under circumstances where the liability issues are still vigorously\ncontested among the parties to this litigation.  This Settlement provides Class Members with a\nreasonable monetary benefit.\nc.  This Settlement is clearly a byproduct of hard-fought litigation between the\nparties, and not a result of any collusion on the part of Class Counsel or Counsel for the\nDefendant.\n12.  Class Counsel submitted to the Court and served on the Defendant their application\nfor reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses consistent with the terms of the Settlement\nAgreement.  This Court has considered Class Counsels’ request and hereby grants an award of\nfees in the amount of twenty-five percent (25%) of the gross settlement amount, and an award\nof all expenses incurred.  \n13.  The claims procedure established under the Settlement Agreement is fair, a\nsimplified process, and workable.  In any event, the Court will retain jurisdiction to work out any\nunanticipated problems.\nNOW, THEREFORE, ON THE BASIS OF THE FOREGOING FINDINGS OF FACT,\nTHE COURT HEREBY MAKES THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS OF LAW:\n14.  This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter of this\nproceeding.\n5\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 87      Filed 12/18/2009     Page 6 of 7\n15.  Pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the following\nSettlement Class is certified for purposes of final settlement.\nAll person who have been placed into the custody of the Dauphin County Prison\nafter being charged with misdemeanors, summary offenses, violations of\nprobation or parole or intermediate punishment, civil commitments, or minor\ncrimes and were strip searched upon their entry into the Dauphin County Prison\npursuant to the policy, custom and practice of the County of Dauphin.  The class\nperiod commences on September 16, 2005, and extends to March 12, 2008. \nSpecifically excluded from the class are Defendants and any and all of their\nrespective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs, successors, employees or\nassignees.\n16.  The Court finds that, for the purpose of this Settlement, the requirements of Rule 23\nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are satisfied, and that a class action is an appropriate\nmethod for resolving the disputes in this litigation.  All the prerequisites for class certification\nunder Rule 23 are present.  The Class Members are ascertainable and too numerous to be\njoined.  Questions of law and fact common to all Class Members predominate over individual\nissues and should be determined in one proceeding with respect to all Class Members.  The\nClass Representatives’ claims are typical of those of the Class.  The Class action mechanism is\nsuperior to alternative means for adjudicating and resolving this action.\n17.  The Settlement Class Representatives, Jennifer Reynolds and Ashley McCormick,\nare entitled to and are each hereby awarded a payment of $15,000, and Class Representative\nDevon Shepard is awarded a payment of $10,000.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nPlaintiffs, Jennifer Reynolds, Ashley McCormick, Herbert Carter, and Devon \nShepard, both individually and on beha lf of a class of others sim ilarly situated, \ninitiated this class action lawsuit with the  filing of a civil com plaint on September \n18,  2007.   (Com plaint,  Doc. 1).   Plaintiffs’ c omplaint  alleges that Plaintiffs \nReynolds, Carter and Shepard were arrested on September 2, 2007 for a violation of \nthe Harrisburg City Code.  (Id.  at ¶ 34).  Plaintiffs’ co mplaint further alleges that \nReynolds,  Carter and Shepard were tr ansported  to Dauphi n  County Prison \n(hereinafter “Prison”) because they coul d not post bond and that they were strip \nsearched upon their admittance to the Prison.  (Id.).   \nPlaintiffs’ complaint avers that Plaintiff Ashley McCormick was arrested on \nSeptember  13, 2007 for fail ing  to pa y  parking  tickets issued by the City of \nHarrisburg.  (Id. at ¶ 35).  Foll owing McCormick’s arrest, Plaintiffs also aver that \nMcCormick  was transported to Dauphi n  County Prison where she was strip \nsearched upon being admitted.  (Id.). \nPlaintiffs’ complaint claims, inter alia, that Defendant has a written and/or de \nfacto policy of strip-searching all individuals who enter the Prison regardless of the \ncrime upon which they are charged and without the presence of reasonable suspicion \nto believe that the individuals are concealing a weapon or contraband.  (Id. at ¶ 25).  \n  1     \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 16      Filed 10/25/2007     Page 7 of 27\n \nPlaintiffs  allege in Count I of their co mplaint  that the stri p  searches of named \nPlaintiffs  and unna med  members of t he  purported  class violated the Fourth \nAmendment of the United States Constitution.  (Id. at ¶¶ 38-43).  Plaintiffs request \nin Count II of their com plaint that this  Honorable Court declare that the policy, \ncustom,  and practice of Defendant is  unconstitutional  because the correctional  \nofficers of the Prison are directing/conducting strip searches of all individuals placed \ninto the Prison without any particularized  suspicion that the individuals have either \ncontraband or weapons.  (Id. at ¶¶ 44-46).  Plaintiffs al so set forth a separate cause \nof  action in Count III of their com plaint  seeking prelimin ary  and perman ent \ninjunctive relief, enjoining  Defendant from strip search ing individuals placed into \ncustody of the Pri son absent any particulari zed suspicion that the individuals have \neither  contraband or weapons.  (Id.   at ¶¶ 47-51).   As a result of the alleged \nconstitutional violation, Plaintiffs seek: (1) an order certifying this action as a class \naction; (2) a judgment against Defendant awarding compensatory damages to each \nnamed Plaintiff and each member of the purported class; (3) a declaratory judgment \ndeclaring that the Defendant’s policy, pr actice and custom of strip searching all \ndetainees is unconstitutional; (4) a preliminary and permanent injunction seeking to \nenjoin  Defendant from continuing to st rip  search individuals without   reasonable \nsuspicion  that such indivi duals  are co ncealing  weapons and/ or  contraband; (5) \nattorney’s fees; (6) and punitive damages.  (Id. at p. 14; Id. at ¶ 1). \n2 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 16      Filed 10/25/2007     Page 8 of 27\n \nII.  STATEMENT OF ISSUES PRESENTED \nA.  Whether on its face and as a ma tter of law, Plaintiffs’ complaint \nfails  to state a claim upon w hich  relief may be granted as to  \nindividuals comprising a substantial portion of the purported class \nbecause, as a matter of la w, reasonable suspicion existed to strip \nsearch those individuals. \n \n[suggested answer in the affirmative] \nB.  Whether the named Plaintiffs  and purported class members lack \nstanding  to seek declarator y  and injunctive relief because \nPlaintiffs’ complaint does not allege that there i s a likelihood that \nthey will be subjected to the complained of conduct in the future. \n \n[suggested answer in the affirmative] \n \nC.  Whether Plaintiffs’ third purported cause of action, which requests \nan injunction, must be dismissed because such cause of action seeks \nonly a form of relief and it cannot be maintained as an independent \ncause of action as a matter of law. \n \n[suggested answer in the affirmative] \n \nD.  Whether Plaintiffs’ claim for puni tive damages must be dismissed \nbecause  Plaintiffs cannot recover punitive damages from \nDefendant as a matter of law  based upon the allegations contained \nin the complaint. \n \n[suggested answer in the affirmative] \n \nE.  Whether  Plaintiffs cannot recover on their allegations that \nDefendant  has a blank et  strip search policy w hen,  in fact, \nDefendant has a written policy which sets forth distinct factors for \neach correctional officer to consider  in his/her determination as to \nwhether the requisite reasonable suspicion exists prior to any strip \nsearch being performed. \n \n[suggested answer in the affirmative] \n \n3 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 16      Filed 10/25/2007     Page 9 of 27\n \n \nIII.  STANDARD OF LAW \n \nThe standard to be applied in consideration of a motion to dismiss pursuant to \nRule 12(b)(6) is well established in our jurisprudence.  The court is to accept as true \nall factual allegations in the c omplaint and draw all reasonable inferences in t he \nlight most favorable to the Plaintiff.  Bo ard of Trustees of Bricklayers and Allied  \nCraftsmen Local 6 of New Jersey v. Wettlin Assoc. Inc., 237 F.3d 270, 272 (3d Cir. \n2001).  The question before the court on a m otion to dismiss is whether the plaintiff \ncan prove any set of facts in support of his  claim that entitles the plaintiff to relief.   \nHartford Fire Insurance Company v. California, 509 U.S. 602; 125 L. Ed. 2d 488;  \n113 S. Ct. 2801 (1993), Ramadan v. Chase Manhattan Corp. , 229 F.3d 194-195-96 \n(3d Cir. 2000).  If it is clear from the pleading that a defendant cannot be held liable, \nthen dismissal of all claims against that defendant is appropriate.  Labov v. Lalley, \n809 F.2d 270 (3d Cir. 1987).    In adjudicating a Rule 12(b)(6) Moti on, the district \ncourt  is not lim ited  to evaluating the   complaint;  rather, it can also conside r \ndocuments attached to the com plaint, matters of public record, and undispute dly \nauthentic documents.  Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. White Consol. Industries, 998 \nF.2d 1192, 1196 (3d Cir. 1993). \n \n \n4 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 16      Filed 10/25/2007     Page 10 of 27\n \nIV.  ARGUMENT \nA.  Plaintiffs’  purported class is  overbroad  and contains putative \nmembers who cannot obtain relief as a matter of law. \n \nPlaintiffs seek class certification pursuant to Rules (23)(b)(2) and 23(b)(3), \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedur e.  (Doc. 1 at ¶¶ 18, 19).  The cl ass that Plaintiffs \nseek to represent is the following: \n All  persons who have been or will be placed into the \ncustody of the Dauphin County Prison after being charged \nwith  misdemeanors,  summary offense s,  violations  of \nprobation or parole, civil comm itments, or minor crimes \nand were or will be strip searched upon their entry into the \nDauphin County Prison pursuant to the policy, custom and \npractice  of the County of Dauphin.  The class period \ncommences on September 16, 2005 and extends to the date \non which Dauphin County is enjoined from , or otherwise \nceases, enforcing their unconstitutional policy, practice and \ncustom  of conducti ng  strip searches absent reasonable \nsuspicion.   Specifically  excluded  from the cl ass  are \nDefendants and any and all of  their respective affiliates, \nlegal  representatives, heirs,   successors, employees or \nassignees.   \n \n(Id. at ¶ 9).   \n  The United States Supreme Court has held  that strip searches of arrestees ar e \nnot per se unconstitutional.  Bell v. Wolfish , 441 U.S. 520, 559; 60 L. Ed. 2d 447,  \n481; 99 S. Ct. 1861, 1884 (1979).  The Court i n Wolfish, however, recognized that \narrestees have a legitimate privacy interest in not being strip searched, and explained \nthat  the governm ent  must  have a reas onable  justification for conducting such \nsearches: \n5 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 16      Filed 10/25/2007     Page 11 of 27\n \nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is \nnot capable of precise definition or mechanical application.  \nIn  each  case it r equires  a balancing of the need for a \nparticular  search against the invasion of personal rights \nthat the search entails.  Courts must consider the scope of \nthe  particular intrusion, the manner in whic h  it is \nconducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in \nwhich it is conducted. \n \nId. (internal citations omitted).  The Wolfish decision acknowledged that stri p and \nbody  cavity searches of pretrial detain ees,  in order to avoid t he  smuggling  of \ncontraband into a detention facility, was a  legitimate government interest, and held \nthat prison administrators should be afforded discretion in how best to prevent such \nsmuggling.  Id. at 559 and n. 40.  Assuming, without holding, that pretrial detainees \nretain some Fourth Amendment rights upon their commitment to a detention facility, \nthe Wolfish court held that body cavity search es of pretrial detainees following \ncontact visits with any person from outside the institution did not violate the Fourth \nAmendment. \n  Interpreting Wolfish, most federal circuit courts  have held that a \"blanket\" \nstrip search policy, calling for t he search of all arrestees without any i ndividualized \njustification, violates the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.

Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614 (9th Cir. 1984); Hill v. \nBogans, 735 F.2d 391 (10th Cir. 1984); Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d \n1263 (7th Cir. 1982).  The preva iling interpretation of Wolfish is that an arrestee to \n6 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 16      Filed 10/25/2007     Page 12 of 27\n \nbe detained in the general jail population has a constitutional right under the Fourth \nAmendment to be free from strip searches  conducted without reasonable suspicion \nthat the detainee is concealing weapons, drug s, or other contraband, and, therefore, \nblanket strip searches of all arrestees, wi thout individualized reasonable suspicion, \nare unconstitutional.  See , e.g., Powell v. Barrett , 496 F.3d 1288, 1310 (11th Ci r. \n2007).  In order t o justify a strip search of a nonviolent arrestee, the governm ent \nmust  have reasonable individualized susp icion  that the detainee is carrying or \nconcealing contraband.  Newkirk v. Sheers , 834 F.Supp. 772, 788 (E.D.Pa. 1993).  \nIndividualized suspicion sufficient to warrant such a strip sear ch may be based on \nsuch factors as the nature of the offense,  the arrestee's appearance and conduct, and \nany prior arrest record.  Id. \nThis interpretation of Wolfish, however, has not been adopted by the United \nStates Supreme Court or the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, \nand has been questioned by other courts.  See, e.g., Hicks v. Moore, 422 F.3d 1246, \nn. 5 (11th Cir. 2005); Evans v. Stephens , 407 F.3d 1272, 1278-79 (11t h Cir. 2005) \n(en banc) (\"Most of us are uncertain that  jailers are required to have a reasonable \nsuspicion of weapons or contraband before strip searching – for security and safety \npurposes – arrestees bound for the general jail population . . . Never has the Supreme \nCourt imposed such a requirement.\"); Johnson v. Phelan, 69 F.3d 144, 152-153 (7th \nCir. 1995) (Posner, J., concurring and di ssenting) (\"[The Fourth] Amendment has \n7 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 16      Filed 10/25/2007     Page 13 of 27\n \nbeen held inapplicable to searches and seiz ures within prisons, and if applicable to \njails housing pretrial detainees as distinct from convicted defendants – an unsettled \nquestion – is only tenuously so . .  .\"); Brothers v. Klevenhagen, 28 F.3d 452, 457 \nand n. 6 (5th Cir. 1994) (“The Court [in Wolfish ] refused to concede that the Fourth \nAmendment applies to [pretrial detainees] and concluded that no protection would \nbe afforded even if it did  apply.\"); Valencia v. Wiggins , 981 F.2d 1440, 1444-45 \n(5th Cir. 1993); U.S. v. Willoughby, 860 F.2d 15, 21 (2d Cir. 1988).    \nEven  under the expansive preva iling  interpretation of Wolfish ,  which \nDauphin County does not concede is correct,  Plaintiffs fail to state a claim with \nregard to a substantial portion of their propos ed class.  Those courts that have hel d \nthat individualized reasonable suspicion is required before the government may strip \nsearch an arrestee have conceded that such reasonable suspicion may be established \nby the circumstances of an arrest or the  nature of the charges brought  against the \narrestee.  See Powell v. Barrett , 496 F.3d 1288, 1310 (11th  Cir. 2007); Tardiff v. \nKnox County, 365 F.3d 1, 5 n.6 (1st Cir. 2004)  (noting that categories such as \ncurrent charge or crim inal history are a perm issible way to establish reasonable \nsuspicion).   \nIn  Powell,  the court held that the circu mstances  of a person's arrest   may \nsupport  reasonable  suspicion to justi fy  a strip search upon booking into jail, \nincluding, for example, the possession of  a weapon by a detainee at the time of \n8 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 16      Filed 10/25/2007     Page 14 of 27\n \narrest.  Id.  The Powell court also held that the nature  of an arrest charge itself , \nindependent  of the   facts surrounding the  arrest,  can give rise to reasonable \nsuspicion; therefore, it is objectively reasonable to conduct a strip search of a person \narrested for an offense involving weapons,  drugs, or violence before placing the \narrestee into the genera l jail population.  Id.  at 1311.  This is true of all crimes \ninvolving weapons, drugs, or violence, regardless of the level of the offense.  Id. \nIn  the end, balancing this se rious  intrusion  against  the \ngovernment's  compelling intere st  in jail security is \nunsusceptible  of precise evidentiary resoluti on, \nundiscernible  in the   language of the Constit ution  or the  \nintent of its fram ers.  But th e Court has the duty t o draw \nthe  line somewher e.   The C ourt  holds  that reasonable \nsuspicion exists to strip search all felony arrestees, and all \ntemporary  detainees  arrested  for m isdemeanor  offenses \nthat involve weapons or contraband.  Reasonable suspicion \nalso exists to strip search all temporary detainees with prior \nrecords  of convictions or unr esolved  arrests for felony \noffenses,  or for misdemeanors involvi ng  weapons or \ncontraband.  Other federal courts appear to have uniformly \ndrawn the line in the same place. \n \nSmith  v. Montgom ery  County, Maryland ,  643 F.Supp. 435, 439 (D.Md. 1986) \n(examining cases). \n  In light of this precedent, it is clear that Plaintiffs fail to state a cause of action \nas to a substantial portion of their proposed class.  Plaintiffs’ proposed class includes \npersons as to whom reasonable suspicion ex isted, arising by the very nature of the \ncrime the person was charged or their past  criminal history, i.e. those detainees \nwhose charges upon intake im plicated either weapons or drugs, or who had a past  \n9 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 16      Filed 10/25/2007     Page 15 of 27\n \nconviction for a fel ony, drug or weapons  charge.  Those persons are included in \nPlaintiffs’  broad class definition unde r  “misdemeanors,  summary  offenses, \nviolations of probation or parole, civil commitments, or minor crimes.”   \nThe following is a small sample of  misdemeanors covered under Plaintiffs’ \nproposed  class definition wh ere  there exists  reasonable  suspicion to search: (1) \nmanufacture, sale or delivery of a contro lled substance, 35 P. S. § 780-113(a)(30); \n(2) knowingly or intentionally possessing a  controlled or counterfeit substance, 35 \nP.S.  § 780-113(a)(16); (3) possession of  a  small am ount  of marijuana only for \npersonal use, 35 P.S. § 780-113(a)(31); (4) the use of, or possession wi th intent to \nuse,  drug paraphernalia 35  P.S.  § 780-113(a)(32); (5)  to  make, repair, sell or \notherwise deal in, use, or possess any o ffensive weapons, with the definition of \noffensive  weapons including metal knuckl es,  dagger, knife, razor or cut ting \ninstrument, 18 Pa.C.S. § 908.   \nAs  to persons who were charged with   such crimes, r easonable  suspicion \njustifying a strip search existed.  Im portantly, \"it is immaterial whether the specific \narresting  officer or jailer  actually  and subjectively   had reasonable suspicion, or \nwhether  anyone at the tim e  actually  conducted a reasonable suspicion analysis.   \nPowell, 496 F.3d at 1310.  Instead, the question for the Court is \"whether, given the \ncircumstances, reasonable suspicion objectively existed to justify the search.\"  Id.   \nTherefore, as a matt er of law, the strip searches o f persons charged with crimes  \n10 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 16      Filed 10/25/2007     Page 16 of 27\n \ninvolving weapons, violence, or drugs, and  those persons with past convictions or \nunresolved arrests for felonie s or crimes involvi ng violence, weapons, or drugs, \nwere objectively justified by  reasonable suspicion and did not violate the Fourth \nAmendment.  Such persons fail to state a claim for a constitutional violation, cannot \nbe included in any class definition, and cannot obtain relief based upon the claims as \nalleged.   \nAt most, Plaintiffs’ class could be comprised of the following: \n All  persons who have been or will be placed into the \ncustody of the Dauphin County Prison after being charged \nwith  misdemeanors,  summary offense s,  violations  of \nprobation or parole, civil comm itments, or minor crimes \nand were or will be strip searched upon their entry into the \nDauphin County Prison, pursuant to the policy, custom and \npractice  of the County of Dauphi n,  where such intake \ncrimes did or do not im plicate either weapons, violence or \ndrugs, and where such persons did or will not, at the time \nof  admission  to D auphin  County  Prison,  have a past \nconviction  or unresolved arre st  for a felony or charge \ninvolving drug, weapons, or violence .  The class  period \ncommences on September 16, 2005 and extends to the date \non which Dauphin County is enjoined from , or otherwise \nceases, enforcing their unconstitutional policy, practice and \ncustom  of conducti ng  strip searches absent reasonable \nsuspicion.   Specifically  excluded  from the cl ass  are \nDefendants and any and all of  their respective affiliates, \nlegal  representatives, heirs,   successors, employees or \nassignees.  (emphasis added) \n \n  It  is antic ipated  that Plaintiffs w ill  argue that Defendant’s contention that \nPlaintiffs’ class is overbroad i s premature and can onl y be addressed at the class \ncertification stage of this m atter.  This,  however, is not a question of whether the  \n11 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 16      Filed 10/25/2007     Page 17 of 27\n \nproposed  class meets the procedural requi rements  to justify class certification; \nrather, this is simply a question of whether some members of the proposed class are \nincapable of stating a claim upon which relief may be granted.   \nThe determination whether there is a proper class does not  \ndepend on the existence of a cause of action.  A suit may \nbe a proper class action, conf orming to Rule 23, and still \nbe dismissed for failure to state a cause of action. \n \nMiller v. Mackey Int'l, Inc., 452 F.2d 424, 427 (5th Cir. 1971).   \n  Defendant's  contention  that  a substa ntial  portion  of t he  proposed class \nmembers fail to state a clai m cannot be reserved for th e class certification stage,  \nbecause the Court is forbidden from inquiring into the merits of Plaintiffs’ claims at \nthat stage.  The class certifi cation stage is reserved for an inquiry i nto whether the \nproposed class meets the procedural requirements of Rule 23. \nRule 23 delineates the scope of inquiry to be exercised by a \ndistrict judge in passing on a class action m otion.  Nothing \nin that Rule indicates the nece ssity or the propriety of an \ninquiry  into  the m erits.   Inde ed,  there is absol utely  no \nsupport in the history of Ru le 23 or legal preced ent for \nturning a motion under Rule  23 into a Rule 12 m otion to \ndismiss or a Rule 56 m otion for summary judgment by \nallowing the district judge to evaluate the possible merit of \nthe  plaintiff's clai ms  at this   stage of the proceedings.   \nFailure to state a cause of action is entirely distinc t from \nfailure to state a class action. \n \nId. (emphasis added).  See also Lau v. Arrow Financial Services, --- F.R.D. ---, 2007 \nWL 2840390, *4 (N.D.Ill. Sept. 28, 2007) (mer its of each potential class m embers' \nclaims could not be addressed at class cer tification stage); Pruitt v. Allied Chemical \n12 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 16      Filed 10/25/2007     Page 18 of 27\n \nCorp.,  85 F.R.D. 100, 104 (E.D.Va. 1980)  (court  could not consi der  motion  to \ndismiss, which offered potential to reduce the class to more manageable numbers, at \nthe class certification stage, because propr iety of class certification under Rule 23 \nwas separate from consideration of merits under Rule 12). \nDefendant  recognizes that claim s,  including  class claim s,  should not be  \ndismissed on the ple adings \"unless it app ears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can \nprove no set of facts in support of hi s claim which would en title him to relief.\" \nConley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80,  84, 78 S. Ct. 99, 102 (1957).   \nHere, however, it can be determ ined from the face of the Pla intiffs’ complaint that \nthe  law cannot provide rec overy  based upon the claim s  alleged, which is the \nappropriate  consideration  when  determining a Motion to Dism iss.   Defendant  \nbelieves that a faci al review of Plaintiffs ’ complaint by the Court will reveal that \nPlaintiffs’ complaint cannot provide recove ry for certain putative mem bers of its \nclass based upon any possible set of facts even if proven to be true.  Therefore, for \nthe reasons discussed supra, Defendant respectfully requests that this Court conclude \nthat Plaintiffs’ complaint fails to state a  claim as to a substa ntial portion of the \nproposed class, and dismiss it as such. \n \n \n \n13 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 16      Filed 10/25/2007     Page 19 of 27\n \nB.  Named Plaintiffs and purported  class members lack standing to \nseek declaratory and injunctive relief because Plaintiffs’ complaint \ndoes not allege that there is a like lihood that they will be subjected \nto the complained of conduct in the future. \n \nPlaintiffs request in Count II of thei r complaint that this Honorable Court  \ndeclare that the policy, custom, and practice of Defendant is unconstitutional in that \nthe correctional officers of the Prison are  directing/conducting strip searches of all \nindividuals  placed i nto  the Prison without  any  particularized suspicion that the \nindividuals have either contraband or weapons.  (Doc. 1 at ¶¶ 44-46).  Plaintiffs also \nset  forth  a separate cause of action i n  Count III of t heir  complaint  seeking \npreliminary  and permanent injunctive   relief,  enjoining De fendant  from  strip \nsearching individuals placed into custody  of the Prison absent any particularized  \nsuspicion that the individuals have either contraband or weapons.   \nA review of standing is a thre shold inquiry; and the proper disposition of a \ncase challenging standing is a m otion to dismiss.  Hassine v. Jeffes , 846 F.2d 169, \n176 (3d Cir. 1988).  Each mem ber of a put ative class must individually possess a \nright to make a claim in a matter.  Strzakowlski v.  GMC, No. 04-4740, 2005 U .S. \nDist. LEXIS 18111, *26 (D.N.J. Aug. 16, 2005 ).  Thus, a class cannot be so broad \nas to include members who have no standing to bring suit on their on accord.  Id.;  \nSee Conte-Bros. Auto. Inc. v.  Quaker State-Slick 50, Inc. 165 F.3d 221 (3d. Cir.  \n1998) (affirming district court’s decision to grant defendant’s motion to dismiss \nbecause putative class members lacked standing based upon the claims alleged in  \n14 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 16      Filed 10/25/2007     Page 20 of 27\n \ncomplaint).   Furtherm ore,  a court m ay  strike  class action allegations pri or  to \ndiscovery when presented with  a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. See  Clark v. McDonald' s \nCorp., 213 F.R.D. 198, 205 n.3 (D.N.J. 2003).   \nIn addition to meeting the basic require ments for standing, a plaintiff m ust \nalso meet the preconditions for asserting an injunctive claim in a federal forum. See \nCity of Los Angeles v. Lyons , 461 U.S. 95, 75 L. Ed. 2d 675,  103 S. Ct. 1660 \n(1983).  To establish standing in an acti on for declaratory or injunctive relief, a \nplaintiff  must  show that he or she is likely to suffer future   injury from   the \ndefendant's illegal conduct.  Roe v. Operation Rescue , 919 F.2d 857, 864 (3d Cir. \n1990).  Past illegal conduct is  insufficient to warrant injunctive or declaratory relief \nunless  it is acco mpanied  by \"continuing, pr esent  adverse effects.\" City of Los \nAngeles, 461 U.S. at 102, 75 L. Ed. 2d at 684, 103 S. Ct. at 1665.  Declaratory relief \nis unavailable to a plaintiff who has al leged nothing more than exposure to past \nunconstitutional state action.  Brown v. Fauver, 819 F.2d 395 (3d Cir. 1987).   \nSeveral  courts in cases challenging  the  constitutionality of strip search \npolicies  have held that the plaintiffs l acked  standing  to pursue injunctive relief \nbecause they cannot show any likelihood that they will be arrested again.  See John \nDoes 1-100 v. Boyd , 613 F. Supp. 1514 (D.Minn.  1985); Smith v. Montgomery \nCounty, 573 F. Supp. 604 (D.Md. 1983).  The plaintiffs in John Does 1-100, similar \nto the Plaintiffs in this action, challenge d the constitutionality of strip search es at a \n15 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 16      Filed 10/25/2007     Page 21 of 27\n \ncounty  detention  facility.  The district court, relying primarily on the Supreme \nCourt's decision in Lyons, held that the plaintiff la cked standing to seek injunctive \nrelief against the de tention center's strip search policy. John Does 1-100 , 613 F. \nSupp.  at 1529.  T he  court noted that   the  “named  plaintiffs cannot establish a \n‘credible threat’ that they will be arrested again.\"  Id.  The court thus concluded that \nthe plaintiffs lacked standing with respect to injunctive relief. \nIn O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 38 L. Ed. 2d 674, 94 S. Ct. 669 (1974), a \nchallenge  to discrim inatory  conduct in t he  administration  of a county crim inal \njustice system, the Supreme Court looked to  this same factor in holding that the \nplaintiffs lacked standing to seek an injunction:  \n[H]ere the prospect of future injury rests on the likelihood \nthat  respondents will again be arrested for and charged \nwith  violations of the crim inal  law and will ag ain  be \nsubjected to bond proceedings, trial, or sentencing before \npetitioners. . . . [w]e assume  that respondents will conduct \ntheir activities within the law and so avoid prosecution and \nconviction as well as exposure  to the challenged course of \nconduct said to be followed by petitioners. \n \nO’Shea, 414 U.S. at 496-97, 38 L. Ed. 2d at 683, 94 S. Ct. at 676.    \nWhile plaintiffs in the instant cas e may be able t o allege t hat if they are \narrested  and detained again they will be   strip searched, they cannot show any \nlikelihood that they will in fact be arrested  again.  Plaintiffs  have not alleged that \nthey  will not conduct their future activitie s  within the parameters of the law.   \nPlaintiffs essentially allege that they  have been exposed to past unconstit utional \n16 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 16      Filed 10/25/2007     Page 22 of 27\n \naction, i.e. that they were subject to an  unconstitutional strip search at the Prison.   \nTherefore, Plaintiffs, named and putative  class members, do not have standing to \nseek injunctive and declaratory relief base d upon the allegations set forth in thei r \nComplaint.  Thus, Counts II and III of Plaintiffs’ complaint should be dismissed.  \n \nC.  Plaintiffs’  third purported ca use  of action,   which  seeks  an \ninjunction,  must be dismissed because such cause of action is a  \nform of relief and it cannot be maintained as an independent cause \nof action as a matter of law. \n \nPlaintiffs’ third cause of action is a  demand for a preliminary and permanent \ninjunction.  Plaintiffs aver that the “continuing pattern of strip searching individuals \ncharged  with m inor  crimes will cau se  irreparable  harm to the new an d/or \nprospective members of the Class, an adequate remedy for which does not exist  at \nlaw.”  (Doc. 1 at ¶ 50).  Although Plaint iffs do not have standing to seek injunctive \nrelief as discussed supra , the third cause of action m ay also be dism issed on the \ngrounds that an injunction is a form of relief and not an independent cause of action.  \nAn injunction is a form of equitable relief.  City of Los Angeles, 461 U.S. at 133, 75 \nL. Ed. at 704, 103 S. Ct at 1682.  Thus, Pl aintiffs’ third cause of action m ust be \ndismissed on these grounds as well. \n \n \n17 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 16      Filed 10/25/2007     Page 23 of 27\n \nD.  Plaintiffs cannot recover punitive  damages from Defendant as a \nmatter  of law   based upon the a llegations  contained in their \ncomplaint. \n \nPlaintiffs seek punitive damages in paragraph 1 of their Complaint.  In City of \nNewport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453 U.S. 247,  69 L. Ed. 2d 616  , 101 S. Ct. 2748  \n(1981), the Supreme Court held that, in  general, a municipality is immune from \nliability for punitive damages in a section 1983 case.  Punitive damages are only \nallowed  against m unicipalities  when  expressly  provided by statute.   Potence  v. \nHazleton Area Sch. Dist., 357 F.3d 366, 372 (3d Cir. 2004).  There is no statutory \nprovision which expressly provides for punitive damages based upon the allegations \ncontained in Plaintiffs’ complaint.  Thus, Dauphin County is immune from liability \nfor punitive damages and the same must be stricken from Plaintiffs’ complaint. \nE.  Plaintiffs cannot recover on their  allegations that Defendant has a \nblanket strip search policy w hen, in fact, Defendant has a w ritten \npolicy which sets forth distinct factors for each correctional officer \nto  consider in his/her determin ation  as to w hether  reasonable \nsuspicion exists prior to any strip search being performed.   \n \n  Defendant has attached a copy of th e Dauphin County Prison’s stri p search \npolicy to its Motion Dismiss at Exhibit “A.”  The general rule is that a district court \nruling on a motion to dismiss may not consider matters extraneous to the pleadings.  \nIn  re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Liti g,  114 F. 3d  1410, 1426   (3d Cir. 1997).   \nHowever, exceptions to the general rule incl ude documents integral to or explicitly \nrelied  upon in the com plaint,  which may be considered without converting t he \n18 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 16      Filed 10/25/2007     Page 24 of 27\n \nmotion to dismiss into one for summary judgment.  Id.  Here, the strip search policy \nattached to Defendant’s Motion and attested to by Dauphin County Prison Warden \nDominick  DeRose, may be considered  by  the Court because it is undoubte dly \nintegral and relied upon by Plaintiffs t hroughout the complaint and serves as the \nbasis for the entire case. \n  Plaintiffs repeatedly allege that Defendant does not have a written strip search \npolicy or, in the alternative, Defendant has a de facto strip search policy because it \nstrip searches every person entering the  prison despite the existence of a written  \nstrip search policy stating otherwise.  Defendant has had a written strip search policy \nat  all times relevant to the alleg ations  contained  in Plaintiffs’ com plaint.  \nDefendant’s strip search policy requires each intake correctional officer to determine \nwhether the requisite particularized reasona ble suspicion existed, i.e. whether the \nintake  crime im plicated  either weapons,  violence  or drugs,   and/or whether the \ndetainee had a past conviction or unresolved arrest for a felony or charge involvi ng \ndrug,  weapons, or violence.  Therefore,  Plaintiffs  cannot maintain any cause of \naction set forth in t heir complaint on the grounds that Defendant did not have a \nwritten strip search policy and any potential recovery cannot be predicated upon the \nsame.  Thus, Plaintiffs’ averments that  Defendant does not  have  a written strip  \nsearch policy and has a blanket strip search policy of searching every individual \n19 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 16      Filed 10/25/2007     Page 25 of 27\n \nadmitted to the Prison m ust be stricken and Plaintiffs’ recovery must be limited to \ntheir de facto policy claim.  \n  WHEREFORE, for the reasons set fort h hereinabove, Defendant, County of \nDauphin, hereby requests that this Honorable grant its Motion to Dism iss and enter \nthe accompanying order. \n       Respectfully  submitted,  \n       Lavery,  Faherty, Young & Patterson, P.C.  \n \nDate: 10/25/07          By: /s/ Frank J.

In selecting a mediator, the\nADR Coordinator should take into account potential conflicts of interest, and if possible, the\nmediator’s geographic location in relation to the attorneys/parties in this case.  Counsel will\nbe informed of the name of the mediator at the case management conference. \n4. The purpose of this conference is to discuss all aspects of this case,\nincluding any pending motions, as well as a schedule for (a) conducting mediation, (b) the\ncompletion of discovery, (c) amendment of pleadings, (d) joinder of parties, (e) filing of\nmotions, (f) counsel’s compliance with the disclosure requirements of Rule 7.1 of the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure and (g) trial.  Presently, joinder of third-party defendants is\ngoverned by Local Rules 14.1 and 14.2; amendment of pleadings by Fed.R.Civ.P. 15; the\nfiling of pretrial motions by Local Rule 7.1; and the closing of discovery by Local Rule 26.4. \nUnless modified at the Case Management Conference, these rules will continue to apply. \nThe subjects for consideration at the Case Management Conference will also include those\nmatters set forth in Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(b) and (c), in addition to the following:\na)  Whether, during discovery, the parties will exchange documents in digital\nformat; whether there are any issues as to the format to be used; and whether there are any\n2\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 21      Filed 11/06/2007     Page 3 of 6\nissues as to the alteration of documents that may routinely occur when paper documents\nare converted to digital format.\nb)  Whether the parties contemplate the use of any photographs in digital\nformat; and whether there are any issues as to how and when digital alteration of photos is\nto be disclosed.\nc)  Whether the parties plan to create and exchange video in digital format; as\nwell as the arrangements for the synchronization of the audio and video of any videotaped\ndepositions in digital format that may be shown at trial.\nd)  Whether there are any issues as to the discovery of digital materials other\nthan those identified in paragraphs 1 through 3 above (such as database), and whether the\nparties have agreed on ground rules for the routine business practices that affect the\nretention of these digital materials.\n5. It is anticipated that, prior to the Case Management Conference, the\nparties, at a minimum, will have complied with the disclosure requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P.\n26(a) so that a reasonable discussion of the merits will take place at the conference.\n6. In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(f) and Local Rule 16.3, lead\ncounsel for each party shall, as soon as practicable and in any event at least five (5) days\nprior to the Case Management Conference, meet and discuss in good faith the matters set\nforth on the Joint Case Management Plan, a copy of which is included in our Local Rules of\n3\n\nCase 1:07-cv-01688-TIV     Document 21      Filed 11/06/2007     Page 4 of 6\nCourt and may be obtained from the Clerk's Office.

See,\ne.g., Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(g).\n7.

Information on the Court’s ECF system can be obtained at the\nCourt’s website, www.pamd.uscourts.gov.  Counsel are directed to familiarize themselves\nwith the Court’s ECF system. Effective September 3, 2003, counsel may be required to\nshow cause why they should not be required to file documents through the ECF system.\nUse of the system will be discussed at the case management conference.\n11.
