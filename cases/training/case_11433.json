Plaintiffs challenged the validity of reductions made by the executive to unexpended allotments of funds appropriated for the Special Diet Program for the 2010-2011 biennium;  July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2011. The Governor authorized the cuts to to avoid deficit spending.</p><p>Plaintiffs claim that the reductions in allotments to the Special Diet Program violate the terms of the \"unallotment statute\", Minn. Stat. § 16A.152, subd. 4, and are unconstitutional as a violation of separation of powers. </p><p>On December 30, 2009, the District Court of Minnesota (Chief Judge Kathleen Gearin) enjoined Defendants from reducing the allotment to the Special Diet Program, retroactive to November 1, 2009, until further order of the court.</p><p>The parties stipulated to an expedited appeal of the district court's decision. On May 5, 2010, in a published opinion, the Minnesota Supreme Court (Chief Justice Eric L. Magnuson) affirmed the district court's decision, but not on the separation of powers argument.  Rather, the Court ruled that the Governor's allotment reductions since July 2009 were not authorized by the unallotment statute, Minn. Stat. § 16A.152, subd. 4, because they were taken before the legislative and executive branches had enacted a balanced budget. The reductions were therefore voided. Ramsey County v. Pawlenty, 781 N.W. 2d 357 (Minn. 2010).</p><p></p>",

Page 1 \nDistrict Court of Minnesota, \nSecond Judicial District. \nRamsey County \n \nDeanna BRAYTON, Darlene Bullock, Forough Mahabady Debra Branley, Marlene Griffin and Evelyn Bernhagen on \nbehalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, Plaintiffs, \nv. \nTim PAWLENTY, Governor of the State of Minnesota; Thomas Hanson, Commissioner, Minnesota Department of \nManagement and Budget; Cal Ludeman, Minnesota Department of Human Services; and Ward Einess, Commissioner. \nMinnesota Department of Revenue, Defendants. \n \nNo. 62-CV-09-11693. \nDecember 30, 2009. \n \nOrder \n \nKathleen Gearin, District Court Chief Judge. \n \nThe above-entitled matter came on for hearing before the undersigned on Monday, November 16, 2009, pursuant to a \nmotion for a temporary restraining order requested by the Plaintiffs and a motion to dismiss requested by the De-\nfendants. The hearing was originally scheduled for November 12th, 2009. It was continued by the Court at the request \nof the General Counsel for Governor Pawlenty. \n \nAttorneys Galen Robinson, David Gassoway, and Rolanda Mason represented the Plaintiffs. Solicitor General Alan I. \nGilbert appeared on behalf of the Defendants. Patrick D. Robben, General Counsel to the Governor, appeared for \nDefendant Governor Pawlenty. \n \nAt the request of the Chair of the Minnesota House of Representatives Committee on rules and legislative adminis-\ntration, the Court granted a motion to allow the Minnesota House of Representatives to submit an Amicus Curiae. This \nbrief was filed on November 20th, 2009. \n \nBased upon the files, records, and proceedings herein, the Court makes the following Order: \n1. Plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order under Rule 65.01 of the Minnesota Rules of Civil Procedure \nenjoining Defendants Governor and the Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Management and Budget from \nreducing allotments to the Minnesota Supplemental Aid Special Diet program and enjoining Defendant Commissioner \nof the Minnesota Department of Human Services from implementing the unallotment of the MSA Special Diet grant is \ngranted retroactive to November 1st, 2009 until further order of this Court. \n2. Defendants' motions are continued to the March 1, 2010 hearing, which has already been scheduled. \n3. The Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Management and Budget is ordered to reinstate the allotments \nto the Minnesota Supplemental Aid Special Diet program retroactively to November 1st, 2009, until further order of \nthis Court. \n4. Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Human Services is enjoined from implementing the unallotment of \nthe MSA Special Diet grant until further order of this Court. \n5. This Order does not prohibit either the Governor or the Legislature from the exercise of their legitimate constitu-\ntional power in light of the current budget issues facing the State of Minnesota. \n6. Either the Legislature or the Governor may bring a motion before this Court to end this order if either believes that \na legitimate exercise of either branch's constitutional powers has made the issues in this lawsuit moot. \n7. The attached Memorandum is incorporated into and made a part of this Order. \n \nLET JUDGMENT BE ENTERED ACCORDINGLY. \n\n2009 WL 5150309 (Minn.Dist.Ct.)   Page 2 \n \nDATED: 12-30-09 \n \nBY THE COURT \n \n<<signature>> \n \nKathleen Gearin \n \nDistrict Court Chief Judge \n \nMEMORANDUM \n \nAt the temporary restraining order hearing, the undersigned stated that “the judicial branch should tread lightly when \ndealing with “separation of powers issues”.” It is just as important that the legislative branch tread lightly when \ndealing with separation of powers issues. It is equally important that the Governor tread lightly when dealing with \nseparation of powers issues. \n \nThe Court has chosen to use the phrase “separation of powers” when discussing the issues raised in this lawsuit. The \nMinnesota Constitution Article 3 Section 1: “The powers of government shall be divided into three distinct depart-\nments.” Minnesota case law uses these terms interchangeably. The Court has chosen to use the term separation of \npowers when referring to this doctrine as it believes that that is more commonly understood by the average citizen. \n \nThe Governor's unallotment power granted to him by the Legislature in Minn. Stat. § 16A.152, Subd. 4, has been held \nby the Minnesota Court of Appeals to be constitutional. Rukavina v. Pawlenty, 684 NW 2nd 525 (Minn. App. 2004). \nIn the Rukavina case, the Court of Appeals stated: “We conclude that MinnStat § 16A.152, does not reflect an un-\nconstitutional delegation of Legislative power, but only enables the Executive to protect the State from financial crisis \nin a manner designated by the Legislature.” That remains the settled law in the State of Minnesota, and it would be \nimproper for this Court to revisit the constitutionality of the unallotment statute itself. It is constitutional. It was the \nspecific manner in which the Governor exercised his unallotment authority that trod upon the constitutional power of \nthe Legislature, and the Legislature alone, to make laws that, in the Court's opinion, was unconstitutional. \n \nIn order to understand the Court's decision, it is necessary to go into a brief summary of the Governor's actions at the \nend of the 2009 Legislative session. Minnesota operates on a two-year budget cycle. The biennial budget is comprised \nof appropriations established in bills passed by the Legislature and signed into law by the Governor. The Governor has \nauthority to veto line items in every appropriation bill. He may even veto an entire bill. The Commissioner of Man-\nagement and Budget is required to prepare a series of forecasts of anticipated revenues and expenditures. MinnStat. § \n16A.103. In November of 2008, the Commissioner forecast a $4.847 billion budget deficit for the 2010/2011 bien-\nnium. The Commissioner's February 2009 forecast continued to project a budget deficit of $4.847 billion for the next \nbiennium. In light of the forecast, the Governor submitted two proposed budgets for the 2010/2011 biennium to the \nLegislature. One was submitted in January, and the second proposed budget was submitted to the Legislature in March \nof 2009. Both proposed budgets submitted by the Governor relied upon the projected budget deficit and included \nnumerous reductions in expenditures. Throughout this time period, the Governor and the State Legislature made \nefforts to develop a state budget. Both branches relied upon the projected budget deficit of the Commissioner. The \ndiscussions were often rancorous and did not result in compromise legislation acceptable to both the legislative ma-\njority and the governor. \n \nOn May 11th, 2009, the Legislature approved H.F. No. 1362, the Health and Human Services appropriations bill. That \nbill contained the appropriations for all Human Services programs for the 2010/2011 biennium, including appropria-\ntions for the Minnesota Supplemental Aid Program, which is the subject of this temporary restraining order. Three \n\n2009 WL 5150309 (Minn.Dist.Ct.)   Page 3 \ndays later, on May 14th, 2009, Governor Pawlenty signed this bill. He exercised his right to line-item veto on only one \nprovision in the bill, funding for the General Assistance Medical Program. He did not veto the entire bill or the section \nof the bill which included the MSA Program. On the same day that he signed this bill into law, therefore making these \nappropriations the law of the State of Minnesota, the Governor announced at a news conference that he would use the \nunallotment statute to balance the state budget. \n \nFour days later, on May 18th, the final day of the Legislative session, the Legislature approved H.F. No. 2323, which \ncontained provisions to increase revenues needed to pay for the appropriations already signed into law by the Gov-\nernor. Governor Pawlenty vetoed H.F. 2323 in its entirety three days later, on May 21st, 2009. Because the legislative \nsession had ended, there was no opportunity for the legislature to attempt to override this veto or to continue to work \non a compromise. \n \nThe revenue bill that the governor vetoed would have balanced the budget based on the anticipated receipts forecast in \nFebruary 2009. The governor used unallotment rather than calling a special session of the legislature or vetoing the \nappropriations bill to balance the budget. He did this after signing numerous spending bills which taken together, he \nknew would not balance the budget unless revenues were raised. He used the unallotment statute to address a situation \nthat was neither unknown nor unanticipated when the appropriation bills became law. The Governors actions in this \ninstance differed from his use of unallotment in the Rukivina case. \n \nIn that situation the governor used unallotment to protect the state from a financial crisis that was both unknown and \nunanticipated when the appropriation bills were signed. In the beginning of June of 2009, Defendants took steps to \nunilaterally balance the budget by unallotting specific programs enacted into law during the session. By exercising his \nunallotment authority to apply to reductions in revenues that were determined by a forecast made before the budget \nhad even been enacted and by not excluding reductions that were already known when the budget was enacted, the \nGovernor crossed the line between legitimate exercise of his authority to unallot and interference with the Legislative \npower to make laws, including statutes allocating resources and raising revenues. The authority of the Governor to \nunallot is an authority intended to save the state in times of a previously unforeseen budget crisis, it is not meant to be \nused as a weapon by the executive branch to break a stalemate in budget negotiations with the legislature or to rewrite \nthe appropriations bill. \n \nIn light of the significant financial problems and the most recent budget projections, the state continues to face six \nmonths later, it is highly likely that cuts made to the appropriations in the health and human services appropriations \nbill will have to be made. Why then should the courts bother to enjoin this unallotment? Is the separation of powers \npart of our constitution that important? \n \nThe citizens of Minnesota, as well as the entire country, are the heirs of our founding fathers, the drafters of the United \nStates Constitution. It was their brilliance that resulted in the creation of a government consisting of three co-equal \nbranches. This results in a system of checks and balances that ensures that none of the three branches has absolute \npower. This system of checks and balances was embraced by the writers of the Minnesota Constitution in the mid-19th \nCentury and continues to the present day in Minnesota, as well as in our country. At times, this system results in \ndisagreements, conflicts, and convoluted compromises that leave no one happy. \n \nIn an 1865 Minnesota Supreme Court case entitled In the Matter of the Application of the Senate, 10 Minn. 78 (1865), \nthe balance of powers was described as follows: “By the constitution, the power of the state government is divided into \nthree distinct departments, legislative, executive, and judicial. The powers and duties of each department are distinctly \ndefined. The departments are independent of each other to the extent, at least, that neither can exercise any of the \npowers of the others not expressly provided for.” Citing Minn. Const., art. III, § 1. This not only prevents an as-\nsumption by either department of power not properly belonging to it, but also prohibits the imposition, by one, of any \nduty upon either of the other not within the scope of its jurisdiction; and, ‘it is the duty of each to abstain from and to \noppose encroachments on either.’ Any departure from these important principles must be attended with evil.” \n\n2009 WL 5150309 (Minn.Dist.Ct.)   Page 4 \n \nThis 1865 case involves a resolution passed by the Minnesota Senate requesting the Supreme Court to furnish to the \nSenate its opinion upon certain questions. The Court ruled this resolution unconstitutional because “... neither the \nLegislative nor the Executive branches can constitutionally assign to the Judicial, any duties but such as are properly \njudicial and to be performed injudicial manner.” Citing Hayburn's Case, 2 U.S. 408, 2 Dall. 409, 1 L.Ed. 436 (1792). \nThe above description of the separation of powers was cited with approval by the Minnesota Supreme Court in the \ncase of Sharood v. Hatfield, 296 Minn. 416, 210 N.W.2d 275 (1973). \n \nThe Court is aware that the actual revenues received by the State since the beginning of the 2010/2011 biennium are \neven less than predicted in the February 2009 dismal forecast. On December 2, Minnesota's Management and Budget \nDepartment reported that general fund revenues for the present two-year budget period are forecast to be $1.156 \nbillion below pre-biennium estimates mainly because of a decline in tax receipts. Even if the budget had been balanced \nthrough painful give and take between the Executive and Legislative branches, the Governor would have had to use his \nunallotment authority before the end of this biennium. \n \nIn 2005, the judicial branch became embroiled in a case, State ex rel. Sviggum v. Hanson, 732 N.W.2d 312 \n(Minn.App.2005), involving separation of powers issues when the Legislature ended the 2005 legislative session \nwithout appropriating the money necessary to fund significant executive-branch functions for the fiscal biennium \nbeginning on July 1st, 2005. It may be helpful to review the facts of that case to understand the complexity of the \npresent situation. At the end of the 2005 session the Governor exercised his constitutional power to call a special \nsession to allow the Legislature to pass the necessary appropriations bills. While the Legislature was still in special \nsession and before agreement had been reached breaking the impasse on appropriations bills, the Attorney General \nfiled a petition in District Court seeking a declaration that the Executive branch must undertake core functions re-\nquired by the State and Federal constitutions and an order requiring the Commissioner of Finance to fund those \nfunctions. The Governor filed a petition to intervene in this lawsuit. He requested similar relief. Neither the Minnesota \nSenate nor the House of Representatives took part in the temporary funding proceedings. The District Court granted \nthe requests of the Attorney General and the Governor's office and issued an order authorizing the Commissioner of \nFinance to continue to fund core government functions in the event the Legislature failed to appropriate the necessary \nfunds before the next fiscal biennium. Fifteen days later the Legislature appropriated funding retroactively to July 1st, \n2005 (the beginning of the biennium) for base level operations of all the agencies whose biennium appropriations had \nnot yet been approved. The Governor signed the bill into law. \n \nApproximately six weeks later a bipartisan legislative group petitioned the Supreme Court for a declaration that the \nfunds the Commissioner dispersed under the District Court's authorization without a legislative appropriation were \ndispersed in violation of the constitution. The Supreme Court required that it be heard first in District Court. The \nDistrict Court denied the petition and the matter went to the Minnesota Court of Appeals. \n \nThe Minnesota Court of Appeals held, among other things, that a writ of quo warranto could not be used to challenge \nthe constitutionality of completed disbursements of public funds. It further ruled that the controversy was not justi-\nciable because it had already been resolved by the Legislature when the Legislature passed the appropriations bill and \nmade them retroactive to July 1st. Because of this, the constitutionality of the District Court's action has never been \nfully addressed by an appellate court. The Court of Appeals stated: \n“The Legislature has exercised its fundamental constitutional power to appropriate the public funds and to provide that \nthe appropriations are retroactive to the beginning of the biennium and supersede the court-approved disbursements by \nthe Commissioner. The judiciary does not have the constitutional power to “re-legislate” the effect of the Legislature's \nappropriations decisions.” Id. at 323. \n \nThe Court of Appeals, however, was clearly sympathetic to the Legislators' position and referred to their argument as \n“compelling”. The Court also stated “... because of the structure and function of Legislative power, it is the Legislature \nand not the judiciary that has the institutional competency to devise a prospective plan for resolving future political \nimpasses.” Id. \n\n2009 WL 5150309 (Minn.Dist.Ct.)   Page 5 \n \nRegarding the present situation, this Court believes that it is the Executive branch that has the institutional competency \nand authority to decide what appropriations should be unalloted, not the judiciary. \n \nThe Legislative branch has the fundamental constitutional power to appropriate the public funds. This power is \ntempered by the Governor's veto authority. Their policy differences regarding how to deal with Minnesota's present \nbudget situation can only be resolved by them. Those branches have the institutional competency to break the present \nbudgetary deadlocks, not the judicial branch. \n \nIt is important that all parties understand that the decision made by this Court today has nothing to do with the merit or \nlack of merit of the individual programs unalloted by the Governor. The Court's decision was based on the way he \nunalloted, not what he unalloted. Difficult decisions that will be painful to many citizens will have to be made by the \nExecutive and Legislative branches in order to deal with the continuing budget crisis in this state. Those budget and \npolicy decisions are not the business of the courts unless they are made in a way that violates the Constitution. \n \nEarlier the Court posed a question regarding whether the separation of powers doctrine continues to be as important in \ntough economic times as it has been in our past. The answer is yes. Two Minnesota Supreme Courts have wisely \nwarned us that: \n“The tendency to sacrifice established principles of constitutional government in order to secure centralized control \nand high efficiency in administration may easily be carried so far as to endanger the very foundation upon which our \nsystem of government rests.” Juster Bros. v. Christgau, 214 Minn. 108, 7 N.W.2d 501, at 506 (1943), citing State ex \nrel. Young v. Brill, 100 Minn., 499, 520, 111 N.W. 294, 639-40 (1907). \n \nThis court agrees with the above quote, and therefore must answer yes to the question posed. \n \nKG \n \n<<signature>> \n \nBrayton v.

Stat. § 16A.152, subd. 4 \n(2008), by using that statute to balance the budget through reducing allotments before the \nbudget-making process was completed. \n  Affirmed.   \n \nO P I N I O N \n \nMAGNUSON, C.J. \n \n  This case presents questions about the authority of Minnesota’s executive branch \nunder Minn. Stat. § 16A.152, subd. 4 (2008), to reduce allotments in order to avoid \ndeficit  spending.    The  Ramsey  County  District  Court  held  that  use  of  the  statutory \n“unallotment” authority to reduce funding for the Minnesota Supplemental Aid—Special \nDiet Program in the circumstances of this case violated separation of powers principles.  \nWe affirm, although on different grounds. \n  Six  Minnesota  residents  who  qualify  for  payments  under  the  Minnesota \nSupplemental  Aid—Special  Diet  (Special  Diet)  Program  brought  an  action  seeking \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief.  These plaintiffs, respondents on appeal, challenge the \n  2 \n\nvalidity  of  reductions  made  by  the  executive  branch  to  unexpended  allotments  of \nappropriated funds available for payments under the Special Diet Program for the 2010-\n2011 biennium, which began July 1, 2009, and ends June 30, 2011.  The plaintiffs assert \nthat the reductions in allotments to the Special Diet Program violate the terms of the \nunallotment  statute,  Minn.  Stat.  §  16A.152,  subd.  4,  and  are  unconstitutional  as  a \nviolation of separation of powers.  The defendants, appellants on appeal, are Governor \nTim Pawlenty and the Commissioners of the Departments of Management and Budget, \nHuman Services, and Revenue.1 \n  As part of the obligation to “manage the state’s financial affairs,” Minn. Stat. \n§ 16A.055,  subd.  1(a)(2)  (2008),  the  Commissioner  of  Minnesota  Management  and \nBudget (MMB), is required to “prepare a forecast of state revenue and expenditures” in \nFebruary and November of each year.  Minn. Stat. § 16A.103, subd. 1 (2008).  The \nCommissioner’s November 2008 forecast for the 2010-2011 biennium projected a deficit \nof $4.847 billion, based on anticipated revenues of $31.866 billion.  The Commissioner’s \nFebruary 2009 forecast projected a deficit of $4.57 billion, based on anticipated revenues \nof $30.7 billion.   \n  In January 2009, the Governor submitted a proposed budget to the Legislature \nwith anticipated revenues of $31.07 billion.  In March 2009, after the February 2009 \nforecast, the Governor submitted a revised budget to the Legislature based on anticipated \n                                              \n1   Although  the  commissioners  of  the  three  departments  are  appellants,  unless \notherwise noted, references in this opinion to the Commissioner mean the Commissioner \nof Minnesota Management and Budget, who implements the challenged statute. \n \n  3 \n\nrevenues  of  $29.905  billion.    An  April  2009  economic  update  from  MMB  showed \nFebruary and March revenues as $46 million less than projected in the February forecast.   \n  On May 9, 2009, the Governor vetoed a revenue bill that increased taxes in order \nto meet the anticipated revenue shortfall.  The Legislature was unsuccessful in its attempt \nto override the veto.  Between May 4 and May 18, the Legislature passed and presented \nto the Governor appropriation bills for the 2010-2011 biennium.  These appropriation \nbills reduced spending below the levels projected in the February 2009 forecast so that \nthe projected deficit of $4.57 billion was reduced to $2.7 billion.  The Governor signed \nthe appropriations bills into law, exercising a limited number of line-item vetoes not at \nissue here.  House File 1362, the Omnibus Health and Human Services Bill, which \nprovided funding for the Special Diet Program that is at issue in this case, became law on \nMay 14.  Act of May 14, 2009, ch. 79, 2009 Minn. Laws 690. \nOn May 18, 2009, the same day it was required to adjourn, the Legislature passed \nHouse File 2323, another revenue bill that would raise taxes to address the $2.7 billion \nprojected deficit remaining after enactment of the appropriations bills.  As he had done \nwith the prior revenue enactment, the Governor vetoed the second revenue bill.  Because \nthe Legislature had adjourned by the time of the veto, the $2.7 billion projected deficit \nremained.  The Governor did not call a special session of the Legislature.  \n  The Minnesota Constitution allows the state to borrow money for only limited \npurposes.  See Minn. Const. art. XI.  As a result, the state’s biennial operating budget \nmust be balanced—that is, expenditures cannot exceed revenues for the biennium.  The \nstatute at issue in this case, Minn. Stat. § 16A.152, subd. 4 (the unallotment statute), \n  4 \n\nprovides the executive branch with a means to address a budget deficit, including creation \nof and authorization to use a budget reserve fund and, if the reserve fund is depleted, \nauthority to reduce unexpended allotments.  The statute provides: \n(a)  If the commissioner determines that probable receipts for the general \nfund will be less than anticipated, and that the amount available for the \nremainder of the biennium will be less than needed, the commissioner shall, \nwith  the  approval  of  the  governor,  and  after  consulting  the  Legislative \nAdvisory Commission, reduce the amount in the budget reserve account as \nneeded to balance expenditures with revenue. \n \n(b)  An additional deficit shall, with the approval of the governor and \nafter  consulting  the  legislative  advisory  commission,  be  made  up  by \nreducing  unexpended  allotments  of  any  prior  appropriation  or  transfer.  \nNotwithstanding  any  other  law  to  the  contrary,  the  commissioner  is \nempowered to defer or suspend prior statutorily created obligations which \nwould prevent effecting such reductions.   \n \n(c)  If the commissioner determines that probable receipts for any other \nfund,  appropriation,  or  item  will  be  less  than  anticipated,  and  that  the \namount available for the remainder of the term of the appropriation or for \nany allotment period will be less than needed, the commissioner shall notify \nthe agency concerned and then reduce the amount allotted or to be allotted \nso as to prevent a deficit.   \n \n(d)  In  reducing  allotments,  the  commissioner  may  consider  other \nsources of revenue available to recipients of state appropriations and may \napply allotment reductions based on all sources of revenue available.   \n \n(e)  In  like  manner,  the  commissioner  shall  reduce  allotments  to  an \nagency  by  the  amount  of  any  saving  that  can  be  made  over  previous \nspending plans through a reduction in prices or other cause. \n \nMinn. Stat. § 16A.152, subd. 4.  An “appropriation” is the Legislature’s authorization “to \nexpend or encumber an amount in the treasury.”  Minn. Stat. § 16A.011, subd. 4 (2008).  \nThe  executive  branch  “allots”  the  appropriated  funds  for  spending  throughout  the \nbiennium.  Minn. Stat. § 16A.011, subd. 3 (2008) (“ ‘Allotment’ means a limit placed by \n  5 \n\nthe commissioner on the amount to be spent or encumbered during a period of time \npursuant to an appropriation.”). \nIn  a  June  4,  2009,  letter,  the  Commissioner  informed  the  Governor  that  the \nconditions to trigger application of the unallotment statute existed and that it would be \nnecessary to reduce allotments to avoid a deficit.  In the letter, the Commissioner stated: \n“I have determined, as defined in Minnesota Statutes 16A.152, that ‘probable receipts for \nthe general fund will be less than anticipated, and that the amount available for the \nremainder of the [2010-2011] biennium will be less than needed.’ ”  The Commissioner \nfurther explained that the February 2009 forecast projected revenues for the biennium of \n$30.7 billion—$1.2 billion less than anticipated in the November 2008 forecast—and that \nbased on the bills enacted by the Legislature and signed by the Governor, forecasted \nrevenues would result in a $2.7 billion shortfall for the biennium.  The Commissioner \nalso noted that the national economy had worsened since the February forecast and that \nyear-to-date receipts for Fiscal Year (FY) 2009 were down $70.3 million compared to the \nFebruary forecast. \n  On  June  16,  2009,  in  accordance  with  subdivision  4  of  section  16A.152,  the \nCommissioner proposed allotment reductions to the Governor.  The Commissioner met \ntwice with the Legislative Advisory Commission to report on the allotment reductions.  \nThe Governor approved proposed allotment reductions of approximately $2.5 billion on \nJuly  1,  the  first  day  of  the  biennium,  and  the  Commissioner  implemented  the \nunallotments beginning that month.  The Commissioner notified the legislative budget \ncommittees of the unallotments within 15 days, as required by Minn. Stat. § 16A.152, \n  6 \n\nsubd. 6 (2008).   Some of the unallotments were effective for both the first and second \nyears of the biennium; some were effective for only the second year of the biennium \nwhich begins on July 1, 2010.  These changes were effected not only by reducing the \nnumber of dollars for specific allotments, but in some instances, by changing substantive \ncriteria that established eligibility for payments or formulas for spending.2  In addition to \nthe  $2.5  billion  of  unallotments,  the  Commissioner  implemented  $210  million  in \nadministrative savings to make up the remainder of the $2.7 billion projected deficit. \n  The  unallotment  at  issue  in  this  appeal  affected  funding  for  the  Special  Diet \nProgram.  The Special Diet Program is part of a broader Minnesota Supplemental Aid \n(MSA)  program,  which  provides  monthly  cash  payments  to  supplement  federal \nSupplemental Security Income benefits.  See Minn. Stat. §§ 256D.33-.54 (2008).  The \nSpecial Diet Program provides for payments to qualified MSA participants on medically \nprescribed  diets.    Minn.  Stat.  §  256D.44,  subd.  5(a).    That  statute  requires  county \nagencies  to  pay  monthly  allowances  to  qualified  individuals  based  on  United  States \nDepartment of Agriculture standards as specifically set out in the statute.  Id.  The Special \nDiet Program funding is included in the general appropriation to the Department of \n                                              \n2   For example, the other unallotment challenged in this lawsuit, but not part of this \nappeal, was to the renters’ property tax refund program.  Under this program renters are \neligible for a refund of a portion of the rent they pay based on a percentage that the \nLegislature deems attributable to property taxes.  The unallotment was accomplished by \nchanging the portion of rent used to calculate the refund from 19% of rent paid, as set by \nthe Legislature, to 15%.  Another example is the unallotment for the Medical Assistance \nProgram.  The eligibility criteria are established in statute, including the asset limitations \nof $20,000 for a household of two or more people and $10,000 for a household of one \nperson.    See  Minn.  Stat.  § 256B.056,  subd.  3c  (2008).    The  unallotment  was \naccomplished by reducing those limits to $6,000 and $3,000, respectively. \n  7 \n\nHuman Services for all MSA programs.  Act of May 14, 2009, ch. 79, art. 13, § 3, subd. \n4(j), 2009 Minn. Laws 690, 991.   \nThe MSA appropriation was $33.93 million for FY 2010 and $35.19 million for \nFY 2011.  Id.  The Commissioner reduced allotments from the MSA appropriations by \n$2.866 million for FY 2010 and $4.3 million for FY 2011, including allotment reductions \nto the Special Diet Program of $2.133 million for FY 2010 and $3.2 million for FY 2011.  \nThe effect of these unallotments was to eliminate Special Diet Program payments from \nNovember 1, 2009, through June 30, 2011, the end of the biennium. \n  The plaintiffs filed their complaint on November 3, 2009, in Ramsey  County \nDistrict Court.  The plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order requiring the \ndefendants to reinstate the Special Diet Program funding while the action was pending, \nand the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint.   \n  In an order and  memorandum filed on November 30, 2009, the district court \ngranted  plaintiffs’  motion  for  a  temporary  restraining  order.    The  court  enjoined \ndefendants  from  reducing  the  allotment  to  the  Special  Diet  Program,  retroactive  to \nNovember 1, 2009, and until further order of the court. \nThe district court concluded that it was bound by  Rukavina v. Pawlenty, 684 \nN.W.2d 525 (Minn. App. 2004), rev. denied (Minn. Oct. 19, 2004), a court of appeals \ncase holding that subdivision 4 of section 16A.152 is constitutional.  Nonetheless, the \ndistrict court held that “[i]t was the specific manner in which the Governor exercised his \nunallotment authority that trod upon the constitutional power of the Legislature.”  The \ncourt did not expressly find that the executive branch had failed to comply with the \n  8 \n\nrequirements of the statute.  The court concluded, however, that because the projected \nbudget shortfall “was neither unknown nor unanticipated when the appropriation bills \nbecame law,” the executive branch’s use of the unallotment authority was invalid.  The \ncourt stated: \nThe authority of the Governor to unallot is an authority intended to save the \nstate in times of a previously unforeseen budget crisis, it is not meant to be \nused as a weapon by the executive branch to break a stalemate in budget \nnegotiations with the Legislature or to rewrite the appropriations bill. \n \n  Shortly after the temporary restraining order ruling, the parties stipulated to the \ndenial of defendants’ motion to dismiss regarding the Special Diet Program funding and \nto entry of final judgment under Minn. R. Civ. P. 54.02 in favor of plaintiffs on that \nclaim.  The district court entered a final partial judgment, and defendants filed a notice of \nappeal to the court of appeals and petitioned for accelerated review in this court.  We \ngranted accelerated review and ordered expedited briefing and oral argument. \nI. \nAppellants here, defendants below, argue that the district court erred in concluding \nthat the unallotment authority in subdivision 4 of section 16.A152 can be exercised only \nfor budget deficits unforeseen while the Legislature is in session.  Appellants contend that \nthe challenged unallotment action was consistent with the plain language of the statute, \nand that even if the statute is ambiguous, their interpretation that there are no temporal \nrestrictions on the statute’s triggering conditions is supported by the canons of statutory \nconstruction.  \n  9 \n\nAppellants  also  contend  that  because  respondents  did  not  challenge  the \nconstitutionality of the unallotment statute in the district court, that issue is not properly \nbefore us.  Appellants argue that if we reach the constitutional question, the statute does \nnot violate separation of powers principles.  Appellants assert that the statute does not \nconfer “pure legislative power,” because the validity of appropriations is not affected by \nunallotment.    Rather,  unallotment  is  within  the  authority  of  the  executive  branch  to \nadminister  the  laws  and  the  budget.    Finally,  appellants  argue  that  the  statute  fully \ncomplies  with  case  law  requirements  for  delegation  of  legislative  authority  to \nadministrative agencies. \n  Respondents argue that under the plain language of the statute, the conditions \nrequired  to  trigger  implementation  of  unallotment  contain  temporal  limitations  that \nprecluded unallotment in the circumstances of this case.  Specifically, respondents assert \nthat the unallotment authority is intended to be exercised only in the event of unforeseen \nfiscal conditions that arise after the beginning of a biennium.  They maintain that even if \nthe plain language of the statute does  not  require their interpretation, the  canons  of \nconstruction compel it.  Respondents further argue that if we adopt appellants’ reading, \nthe  statute  would  allow  an  unconstitutional  infringement  on  the  Legislature’s \nappropriation power because the executive branch could create a deficit situation by \nrefusing to agree on revenue measures and then unilaterally alter spending priorities that \nhad been enacted into law. \n  10 \n\nII. \nWe first address the statutory issue raised by the parties.  Because we conclude the \nunallotment at issue here exceeded the scope of the statutory authority, and thus affirm \nthe district court, we do not address the arguments raised concerning the constitutionality \nof the unallotment action or the statute.  See In re Senty-Haugen, 583 N.W.2d 266, 269 \nn.3 (Minn. 1998) (we avoid a constitutional ruling if there is another basis on which we \nmay decide a case).   \nOur goal when interpreting statutory provisions is to “ascertain and effectuate the \nintention of the legislature.”  Minn. Stat. § 645.16 (2008); accord Educ. Minn.-Chisholm \nv. Indep. Sch. Dist. No. 695, 662 N.W.2d 139, 143 (Minn. 2003).  The statutory question \nhere  is  whether  the  Legislature  intended  the  unallotment  authority  conferred  on  the \nexecutive branch in Minn. Stat. § 16A.152, subd. 4, to apply in the circumstances of this \ncase.  We determine legislative intent “primarily from the language of the statute itself.”  \nGleason v. Geary, 214 Minn. 499, 516, 8 N.W.2d 808, 816 (1943).  If the text is clear, \n“statutory construction is neither necessary nor permitted and [we] apply the statute’s \nplain meaning.”  Am. Tower, L.P. v. City of Grant, 636 N.W.2d 309, 312 (Minn. 2001).  \nBut if a statute is ambiguous, we apply canons of construction to discern the Legislature’s \nintent.  See Minn. Stat. § 645.16 (2008). \nThe parties offer competing interpretations of the language of the unallotment \nstatute, as outlined above.   Both sides argue that the plain language of the unallotment \nstatute supports their interpretation.  Plain language controls only if the text of the statute \nis unambiguous, that is, if the language is susceptible to only one reasonable meaning.  \n  11 \n\nKratzer v. Welsh Cos., LLC, 771 N.W.2d 14, 21 (Minn. 2009).  The first question we \naddress,  then,  is  whether  only  one  of  the  proffered  interpretations  of  the  statute  is \nreasonable. \n  Respondents’ interpretation, accepted by the district court, is a reasonable reading \nof the statute, particularly when the two clauses of section 16A.152, subdivision 4(a) \n(“probable receipts for the general fund will be less than anticipated, and that the amount \navailable for the remainder of the biennium will be less than needed”) are read as a whole \nand the words are interpreted in accordance with their common meanings.  See Minn. \nStat. §§ 645.08, 645.16 (2008).  “Remainder” is defined as “a remaining group, part, or \ntrace.”  Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary 986 (10th ed. 1993).  “Remain” is \ndefined as “to be a part not . . . used up.”  Id.  The common meaning of “remainder” is \nthus  something  less  than  the  whole,  after  part  of  the  whole  has  been  removed  or \nconsumed.  Accordingly, the requirement that the Commissioner find that “the amount \navailable  for  the  remainder  of  the  biennium  will  be  less  than  needed,”  Minn.  Stat. \n§ 16A.152, subd. 4(a), reasonably means that the triggering circumstance (amount less \nthan needed) cannot logically be met until some of the biennium has passed, and that the \nunallotment process can never apply to a full biennium.  Moreover, the two clauses are \njoined by the conjunctive “and”; when read together, the natural conclusion is that the \ndetermination about receipts being “less than anticipated” must be related to “the amount \navailable for the remainder of the biennium.”  \n  Appellants present a more strained interpretation of Minn. Stat. § 16A.152, subd. \n4(a). The meaning appellants attribute to “remainder”—that the remainder can be the \n  12 \n\nentire  biennium  before  anything  is  removed—does  not  comport  with  the  common \nunderstanding of that word.  On the other hand, appellants are correct that the probable \nreceipts clause contains no express language dictating a timing element for the “less than \nanticipated” criterion, and the assertion that there is no timing limitation on this triggering \ncondition is not unreasonable.  But rather than establishing the plain meaning of that \ncriterion, the absence of any timing definition leaves it ambiguous—subject to precisely \nthe kind of debate about the proper baseline for “less than anticipated” that is presented in \nthis case. \n  Although  the  competing  interpretations  advanced  by  the  parties  are  each \nreasonable, that fact simply brings into focus the failure of the statutory language to \nclearly answer two questions: (1) probable receipts anticipated when? and (2) amount \navailable for what purpose?  Because we determine the language of the unallotment \nstatute is ambiguous, we must employ the canons of construction to determine what the \nLegislature intended by the language it used. \nMinnesota  Statutes  §  645.16  provides  that  when  the  words  of  a  law  are  not \nexplicit, we may ascertain the intention of the Legislature by considering, among other \nmatters:  \n(1) the occasion and necessity for the law;  \n(2) the circumstances under which it was enacted;  \n(3) the mischief to be remedied; \n(4) the objects to be attained; \n(5) the former law, if any, including other laws upon the same or similar \nsubjects; \n  13 \n\n(6) the consequences of a particular interpretation; \n(7) the contemporaneous legislative history; and  \n(8) legislative and administrative interpretations of the statute.   \n \nIn  addition,  the  Legislature  has  provided  that  courts  may  be  guided  by  certain \npresumptions in ascertaining legislative intent, including that “the legislature intends the \nentire  statute  to  be  effective  and  certain,”  Minn.  Stat.  § 645.17(2)  (2008),  and  “the \nlegislature does not intend to violate the Constitution of the United States or of this state.”  \nMinn. Stat. § 645.17(3) (2008). \n  The challenge to the unallotment authority is directly related to the functions of \nboth the legislative and executive branches in establishing the state budget.  Accordingly, \nwe must interpret the statute in that context.  We therefore briefly review the budget-\ncreation process as it is constitutionally defined, and the roles of the legislative and \nexecutive branches. \nAs  the  names  of  the  two  branches  suggest,  the  legislative  branch  has  the \nresponsibility and authority to legislate, that is, to make the laws, Minn. Const. art. IV, \n§§ 17-23, and the executive branch has the responsibility and authority to execute, that is, \nto carry out, the laws, Minn. Const. art. V, § 3.  Under the Separation of Powers Clause, \nno branch can usurp or diminish the role of another branch.  See Minn. Const. art. III, § 1.  \nIn State ex rel. Birkeland v. Christianson, we said: \nThe three departments of state government, the legislative, executive, and \njudicial, are independent of each other.  Neither department can control, \ncoerce, or restrain the action or nonaction of either of the others in the \nexercise of any official power or duty conferred by the Constitution, or by \nvalid law, involving the exercise of discretion.  The Legislature cannot \nchange  our  constitutional  form  of  government  by  enacting  laws  which \n  14 \n\nwould destroy the independence of either department or permit one of the \ndepartments to coerce or control another department in the exercise of its \nconstitutional powers. \n \n179 Minn. 337, 339-40, 229 N.W. 313, 314 (1930).   \n \nThe Legislature has the primary responsibility to establish the spending priorities \nfor the state through the enactment of appropriation laws.  Minn. Const. art. IV, § 22j; id. \nart. XI, § 1.  The executive branch has a limited, defined role in the budget process.  The \nGovernor  may  propose  legislation,  including  a  budget  that  includes  appropriation \namounts, which proposals the Legislature is free to accept or reject.  But the only formal \nbudgetary authority granted the Governor by the constitution is to approve or veto bills \npassed by the Legislature.  See Minn. Const. art. IV, § 23.  With respect to appropriation \nbills, the constitution grants the Governor the more specific line-item veto authority, \nthrough which an item of appropriation can be vetoed without striking the entire bill.  Id.  \nIf the Governor exercises the veto power, the Legislature may reconsider the bill or items \nvetoed, and if approved by a two-thirds vote, the vetoed bill or item becomes law.  Id.  \n  Once a bill has been passed by the Legislature and approved by the Governor (or a \nveto is overridden), the bill becomes law, and the constitutional responsibility of the \nGovernor is to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.”  Minn. Const. art. V, § 3.  \nIf this process of legislative passage and gubernatorial approval or veto does not succeed \nin producing a balanced budget within the normal legislative session, the Governor has \nthe authority to call the Legislature into special session.  See Minn. Const. art. IV, § 12. \nAfter appropriations are enacted, the executive branch undertakes a process of \nallotment.    The  Commissioner  approves  spending  plans  and  establishes  spending \n  15 \n\nallotments for segments of the biennium, thereby managing the pace at which executive \nbranch agencies spend their appropriations.  See Minn. Stat. § 16A.14 (2008).  In normal \ncircumstances, the allotment process functions simply as a device to manage the cash \nflow of the state as the funds appropriated by the Legislature are spent for the purposes \nintended.3  Unallotment occurs when the prior spending authorizations are altered, or, as \nin this case, canceled.  The question before us is whether the Legislature intended to \nauthorize  the  executive  branch  to  use  the  unallotment  process  in  the  circumstances \npresented here. \n                                              \n3  The parties discuss at some length the nature and scope of inherent executive \nspending authority, and to differing degrees, assert that these principles should guide our \ndecision.  We have not previously addressed this authority, but other state courts have.  \nMost  courts  conclude  that  the  executive  branch  has  some  inherent  authority  and \ndiscretion over spending, particularly to spend less than appropriated, but only within the \nscope of legislatively enacted spending priorities.  E.g., Opinion of the Justices to the \nSenate, 376 N.E.2d 1217, 1223 (Mass. 1978) (“The constitutional separation of powers \nand  responsibilities,  therefore,  contemplates  that  the  Governor  be  allowed  some \ndiscretion to exercise his judgment not to spend money in a wasteful fashion, provided \nthat  he  has  determined  reasonably  that  such  a  decision  will  not  compromise  the \nachievement of underlying legislative purposes and goals.”); Hunter v. State, 865 A.2d \n381, 390-91 (Vt. 2004) (adopting rationale of Opinion of the Justices in noting that \nalthough the Governor has some discretion in deciding whether to spend appropriated \nfunds, “[i]f the Governor has a free hand to refuse to spend any appropriated funds, he or \nshe can totally negate a legislative policy decision that lies at the core of the legislative \nfunction”); Rios v. Symington, 833 P.2d 20, 23, 29 (Ariz. 1992) (explaining that the \nLegislature “establishes state policies and priorities and, through the appropriation power, \ngives those policies and priorities effect” and the executive branch then retains discretion \nto  prevent  wasteful  spending  while  still  effectuating  legislative  goals);  Colo.  Gen. \nAssembly  v.  Lamm,  700  P.2d  508,  520,  522  (Colo.  1985)  (recognizing  executive \n“authority to administer the budget” but holding that the authority does not extend so far \nas to “directly contravene major objectives or purposes sought to be achieved” in an \nappropriation).    The  inherent  authority  of  the  executive  branch  concerning  actual \nspending decisions once appropriations are made is not, however, directly implicated in \nthe issue we decide today, that is, whether Minnesota’s unallotment statute was properly \ninvoked in this case.  \n  16 \n\n  Appellants and respondents both argue that the purpose of the unallotment statute \nsupports  their  favored  interpretation.    See  Minn.  Stat.  §  645.16(1),  (4)  (court  may \nconsider  “the  occasion  and  necessity  for  the  law”  and  “the  object  to  be  attained”).  \nAppellants offer a broad purpose for the statute—the elimination of budget deficits—to \nsupport their view of the broad reach of the statute.4  Respondents argue in support of \ntheir narrower reading that the statute has the limited purpose of addressing short term, \nunanticipated deficits.   \n  The distinct roles and powers allocated by the constitution to the two branches in \nthe  budget-creation  process  inform  us  concerning  the  purpose  and  intent  of  the \nLegislature in enacting the unallotment statute.  The general veto and the line-item veto \nare the specific tools provided by the constitution to the executive branch for achieving a \nbalanced budget.  See Johnson v. Carlson, 507 N.W.2d 232, 235 (Minn. 1993) (“The \nstate constitution, recognizing the governor’s oversight responsibilities for the state’s \nbudget,  provides  a  gubernatorial  line  item  veto  to  enable  the  state’s  chief  executive \nofficer to engage in cost-containment, subject, of course, to the possibility of the veto \n                                              \n4   Appellants also argue that the consequences of their interpretation, see Minn. Stat. \n§ 645.16(6), and the public interest, see Minn. Stat. § 645.17(5), favor their view of the \nstatute, but these arguments are essentially variations of their argument about the statute’s \npurpose.    In  addition,  appellants  contend  that  the  Commissioner’s  interpretation  is \nentitled to deference.  See Minn. Stat. § 645.16(8).  Because the question presented is not \none that invokes the expertise of the Commissioner regarding the intricacies of the state \nbudget and his interpretation is not a longstanding one, deference is not warranted.  See \nResident  v.  Noot,  305  N.W.2d  311,  312  (Minn.  1981)  (stating  that  deference  to \nadministrative  interpretations  of  statutes  is  appropriate  when  the  administrators  have \nspecialized  expertise  in  the  subject  of  the  statute  and  the  interpretation  is  of  long \nstanding).  \n  17 \n\nbeing overturned.”).  But we have recognized that the special line-item veto power the \nconstitution confers on the Governor for appropriation bills must be construed narrowly \nto prevent usurpation of the Legislature’s proper authority.  Inter Faculty Org. v. Carlson \n(IFO), 478 N.W.2d 192, 194 (Minn. 1991).   \n  In the context of this limited constitutional grant of gubernatorial authority with \nregard to appropriations, we cannot conclude that the Legislature intended to authorize \nthe executive branch to use the unallotment process to balance the budget for an entire \nbiennium when balanced spending and revenue legislation has not been initially agreed \nupon by the Legislature and the Governor.  Instead, we conclude that the Legislature \nintended the unallotment authority to serve the more narrow purpose of providing a \nmechanism by which the executive branch could address unanticipated deficits that occur \nafter a balanced budget has previously been enacted.5  \n                                              \n5   Courts in several other states have considered similar, but not identical, statutes \nand resolved both statutory and constitutional challenges to actions taken under those \nstatutes.  See, e.g., New England Div. of the Am. Cancer Soc’y v. Comm’r of Admin., 769 \nN.E.2d 1248, 1257-58 (Mass. 2002) (holding that the acting governor complied with \nterms  of  Massachusetts’  unallotment  statute  and  that  the  statute  was  constitutional); \nChiles v. Children A, B, C, D, E, & F, 589 So.2d 260, 267-68 (Fla. 1991) (holding that \nFlorida’s unallotment statute was unconstitutional because it did not contain sufficient \nguidelines to guide the executive branch in exercising delegated authority);  Univ. of \nConn. Chapter of AAUP v. Governor, 512 A.2d 152, 159 (Conn. 1986) (upholding the \nconstitutionality of Connecticut’s unallotment statute).  None of those cases, however, \nconfronted the situation that we face—that is, use of statutory adjustments of legislative \nspending decisions in the absence of a duly enacted budget.  See, e.g., New England, 769 \nN.E.2d  at  1249-50  (addressing  a  challenge  to  allotment  reductions  in  response  to \ndecreased revenue projections that occurred months after the enactment of a budget).  As \na  result,  although  we  may  take  some  guidance  from  those  cases  regarding  general \nprinciples of legislative and executive authority for appropriations and spending, in the \nend, we can and do resolve the case before us based on our reading of the statute enacted \n(Footnote continued on next page.) \n  18 \n\nAppellants’ interpretation of the unallotment statute envisions a much broader role \nfor the executive branch in the creation of biennial budgets than the process established \nby  the  constitution.    Under  appellants’  interpretation  of  the  unallotment  statute,  the \nexecutive branch has authority to modify spending decisions previously enacted into law \nif revenues projected (apparently at any time) for the biennium fall short of the spending \nauthority in appropriation bills passed by the Legislature and signed by the Governor, \nwhether the shortfall results from revenues lower than projected, a gubernatorial veto of a \nrevenue bill, or legislative failure to pass adequate revenue legislation. The unallotment \nauthority so construed would result in an alternative budget-creation mechanism that \nbypasses the constitutionally prescribed process.  There is nothing to suggest that was the \npurpose for which the unallotment statute was enacted.6 \nOn the contrary, it appears clear to us that the object to be attained, see Minn. Stat. \n§ 645.16(4), was the creation of a mechanism for adjusting expenditures, to be available \n \n(Footnote continued from previous page.) \nby  the  Minnesota  Legislature.    On  that  point,  we  find  the  greatest  guidance  in  our \nestablished canons of construction, and the words of the statute before us. \n \n6   Appellants argue that the statute does not allow the executive branch to change the \nactual amount appropriated, and the executive branch cannot use funds for a purpose \ndifferent than they are appropriated for, Minn. Stat. § 16A.139  (2008).   The result, \naccording to appellants, is that the decisions of the Legislature are not substantively \naffected by unallotment.  But this argument ignores the practical effect of unallotment.  \nAlthough the funds from a program whose funding is cut are not technically redirected to \nthe program whose funding is not cut, the effect of selective unallotment is the same.  \nUnder  the  unallotments  made  by  the  Commissioner,  some  programs  received  full \nfunding, some received reduced funding, and some, like the MSA Special Diet program \nreceived  no  funding,  effectively  eliminating  the  program  which  the  Legislature  had \nenacted. \n  19 \n\nin the event of an unanticipated revenue shortfall after enactment of a balanced budget.  \nThis narrow purpose and interpretation is consistent with and reflected in all prior use of \nthe statute.  See Peter S. Wattson, Legislative History of Unallotment Power 4-5, 9, 11 \n(June 29, 2009). \nThe requirement of a balanced budget as a necessary precursor to the use of the \nunallotment authority in section 16A.152, subdivision 4, provides necessary meaning to \nthe triggering condition of “receipts less than anticipated.”  The parties agree that for a \ncurrent amount of receipts to be “less than anticipated,” there must be some past baseline \namount to which the current amount is compared.  But appellants’ argument that there are \nno temporal limitations on this requirement leaves it entirely untethered—and virtually \nmeaningless—because  the  executive  branch  could  assign  any  previous  projection  of \ngreater revenues as the baseline.  This result is contrary to the statutory presumption that \n“the  legislature  intends  the  entire  statute  to  be  effective  and  certain.”    Minn.  Stat. \n§ 645.17(2) (emphasis added).  Reading the statute to require enactment of a balanced \nbudget as a predicate to the exercise of unallotment authority provides a definite and \nlogical  reference  point  for  measuring  whether  current  revenues  are  “less  than \nanticipated.”  The anticipated revenues are measured as of the date the balanced budget is \nenacted. \nThis conclusion is bolstered by consideration of the second triggering condition. \nThe only purpose for which revenues would be logically “needed” in the context of the \nunallotment statute is to fully fund all appropriations.  Thus,  in order for “probable \nreceipts . . . [to] be less than anticipated, and . . . the amount available for the remainder \n  20 \n\nof the biennium [to] be less than needed,” there must have been a point in time when \nanticipated  revenues  appeared  to  be  adequate  to  fund  appropriations—i.e.,  when  a \nbalanced budget was enacted. \nThe temporal limitations implicit in the common meaning of the words “less than \nanticipated” and “remainder of the biennium” constrain the statute’s use to circumstances \nconsistent with the distinct powers and roles conferred on the legislative and executive \nbranches in the constitution.  Those circumstances do not include use of unallotment \nauthority to address a deficit known to exist but not resolved by the legislative and \nexecutive branches using their constitutionally specified powers to enact spending and \nrevenue legislation.  The unallotment statute provides the executive branch with authority \nto address an unanticipated deficit that arises after the legislative and executive branches \nhave enacted a balanced budget.  The statute does not shift to the executive branch a \nbroad budget-making authority allowing the executive branch to address a deficit that \nremains after a legislative session because the legislative and executive branches have not \nresolved their differences.   \n  Because the legislative and executive branches never enacted a balanced budget \nfor the 2010-2011 biennium, use of the unallotment power to address the unresolved \ndeficit  exceeded  the  authority  granted  to  the  executive  branch  by  the  statute.    We \ntherefore affirm the district court’s conclusion that the unallotment of the Special Diet \nProgram funds was unlawful and void. \n  Affirmed. \n \n  21 \n\nC O N C U R R E N C E \nPAGE, Justice (concurring). \n  I concur in the opinion of the court that the exercise of unallotment authority at \nissue in this case was not authorized by the unallotment statute, Minn. Stat. § 16A.152, \nsubd. 4 (2008).  I write separately to highlight my concern that the unallotment statute \nconfers on the executive branch such broad and uncircumscribed authority to rewrite \nlegislative spending decisions that it may constitute an unlawful delegation of legislative \nauthority in violation of the separation of powers principle in our constitution. \n  Separation of powers is a core feature of our governmental structure, included in \nour  state  constitution  based  on  the  model  of  the  United  States  Constitution.1    The \nprinciple originates from the concern “that if all power were concentrated in one branch \nof government, tyranny would be the natural and probable result.”  Wulff v. Tax Court of \nAppeals, 288 N.W.2d 221, 222-23 (Minn. 1979).  Despite the fundamental nature of the \nseparation of powers principle, we have recognized that “there has never been an absolute \ndivision of governmental functions in this country, nor was such even intended.”  Id. at \n223 (footnote omitted). \n                                              \n1   Article III, Section 1, of the Minnesota Constitution provides: \n \n  The  powers  of  government  shall  be  divided  into  three  distinct \ndepartments:  legislative,  executive  and  judicial.    No  person  or  persons \nbelonging to or constituting one of these departments shall exercise any of \nthe powers properly belonging to either of the others except in the instances \nexpressly provided in this constitution. \nC-1 \n \n\n  Although separation of powers does not require absolute separation of legislative \nand  executive  functions,  we  have  long  held  that  the  separation  of  powers  principle \nprohibits legislative delegation of pure legislative power, that is, the power to make the \nlaw.  For example, in State v. Great Northern Railway Co., 100 Minn. 445, 111 N.W. 289 \n(1907), we struck down, on separation of powers grounds, a statute that authorized the \nRailroad and  Warehouse Commission to approve capital stock increases for railroad \ncorporations.  Id. at 470-71, 111 N.W. at 290.  We examined at length the necessary \nseparation  of  powers  distinction  between  permissible  delegation  of  the  power  to \nadminister a law and impermissible delegation of the power to make the law.  Id. at 475-\n81, 111 N.W. at 292-94.  We stated that “ ‘[t]he true distinction is between the delegation \nof power to make the law, which necessarily involves a discretion as to what it shall be, \nand the conferring of authority or discretion to be exercised under and in pursuance of the \nlaw.’ ”  Id. at 477, 111 N.W. at 293 (quoting State v. Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. \nCo., 38 Minn. 281, 300, 37 N.W. 782, 787-88 (1888), rev’d on other grounds, 134 U.S. \n418 (1890)).  We found the statute at issue constitutionally deficient because it committed \n“the  whole  subject  of  the  increase  of  capital  stock  by  railway  corporations  to  the \njudgment and discretion of the commission.”  Id. at 479, 111 N.W. at 294. \nWe reiterated this separation of powers principle in Lee v. Delmont, 228 Minn. \n101,  36  N.W.2d  530  (1949).    We  explained  that  the  separation  of  powers  doctrine \nprecludes  the  Legislature  from  delegating  purely  legislative  power.    Id.  at  112,  36 \nN.W.2d at 538.  We described “pure legislative power” as “the authority to make a \nC-2 \n \n\ncomplete law—complete as to the time it shall take effect and as to whom it shall apply—\nand to determine the expediency of its enactment.”  Id. at 113, 36 N.W.2d at 538. \n  Under our definition of pure legislative power, the sweeping discretion granted by \nsection  16A.152,  subdivision  4,  to  modify  and  negate  legislative  spending  decisions \nraises serious separation of powers concerns.  The lack of direction in the Minnesota \nstatute about how unallotment authority may be exercised once it is triggered leaves the \nexecutive  branch  with  virtually  unfettered  discretion  to  decide  which  funds  to  cut \nentirely, which to reduce in some measure, and which to leave fully funded.  Such \ndecisions inevitably change the legislative priorities established in the properly enacted \nappropriations laws, and the grant in subdivision 4 of section 16A.152 to the executive \nbranch of broad and uncircumscribed authority to make such changes may run afoul of \nthe separation of powers principle.  Although we need not decide that issue today, the \nlegislative and executive branches should be aware of that potential problem. \n \nANDERSON, Paul H., Justice (concurring). \n  I join in the concurrence of Justice Page. \n \nC-3 \n \n\nC O N C U R R E N C E \nANDERSON, Paul H., Justice (concurring). \nA legislative, an executive, and a judicial power comprehend the whole of \nwhat is meant and understood by government.  It is by balancing each of \nthese powers against the other two, that the efforts in human nature towards \ntyranny can alone be checked and restrained, and any degree of freedom \npreserved in the constitution. \n \nJohn Adams, Letter to Richard Henry Lee (Nov. 15, 1775), in 4 The Works of John \nAdams 186 (Charles Francis Adams ed., 1851),  quoted in The Oxford Dictionary of \nAmerican Legal Quotations 377 (Fred R. Shapiro ed., 1993). \n  I join in the concurrence of Justice Page because I share his concerns regarding the \nbalance of power between all three branches of government.  That said, nothing about my \njoining in Justice Page’s concurrence should be construed to diminish my support for the \nopinion of the majority, which I support without reservation. \n \nC-1 \n \n\nD I S S E N T \nGILDEA, Justice (dissenting).   \n \nIn our constitution, the people of Minnesota restricted the ability of the state \ngovernment to deficit spend.  The political branches have agreed on a process in the \nunallotment statute for ensuring that the government meets this obligation.  Whether that \nprocess is the wisest or most prudent way to avoid deficit spending is not an issue for \njudicial review.  That question should be left to the people themselves to debate and \nresolve through the political process.  The judiciary’s “duty” is simply “to apply the law \nas written by the legislature.”  Int’l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, Local No. 292 v. City of St. \nCloud, 765 N.W.2d 64, 68 (Minn. 2009) (Magnuson, C.J., for a unanimous court).  The \nmajority is unable to do so because the language the Legislature used in the unallotment \nstatute  leaves  the  majority  with  uncertainty  and  ambiguity.    The  majority  therefore \nrewrites the statute to insert additional conditions, and then finds that the Commissioner \nof Minnesota Management and Budget (Commissioner) violated the statute because he \ndid not comply with the conditions the majority has added.   \nUnlike the majority, I do not find the language the Legislature used uncertain or \nambiguous as applied to the unallotment at issue in this case.  I would not rewrite the \nstatute; I would apply the language as written.  Because I would hold that the executive \nbranch complied with the plain language of the statute, and that respondents have not met \ntheir burden to prove that the statute is unconstitutional, I respectfully dissent. \nRespondents challenge the decision of the Commissioner to unallot funds for the \nMinnesota  Supplemental  Aid–Special  Diet  Program  (Special  Diet  Program).    The \nD-1 \n \n\nunallotment  was  effective  November  1,  2009.    The  Commissioner  carried  out  the \nunallotment under Minn. Stat. § 16A.152, subd. 4 (2008).  Respondents contend, and the \ndistrict court held, that the Commissioner did not comply with the statute.  Respondents \nalso  contend  that  the  statute  is  unconstitutional.    Because  I  conclude  that  the \nCommissioner properly carried out his duties under the statute and because I conclude \nthat  respondents  have  not  met  their  burden  to  prove  that  the  unallotment  statute  is \nunconstitutional, I would reverse.   \nI. \n  I turn first to the question of whether the Commissioner complied with the statute.   \nThe Minnesota Legislature has charged the Commissioner with “manag[ing] the state’s \nfinancial affairs.”  Minn. Stat. § 16A.055, subd. 1(a)(2) (2008).  One of the ways in \nwhich the Commissioner performs this management function is to prepare “a forecast of \nstate revenue and expenditures” in February and again in November of each year.  Minn. \nStat. § 16A.103, subd. 1 (2008).  In November 2008, the Commissioner anticipated that \nthe state would receive $31.866 billion in revenue for the 2010-2011 biennium.  In \nFebruary 2009, the Commissioner modified this revenue forecast, and anticipated that the \nstate would receive $30.7 billion in revenue, and that the state would have $4.57 billion \nless than necessary to meet its obligations in the 2010-2011 biennium.  During the 2009 \nlegislative  session,  spending  changes  were  enacted  into  law  that  reduced  the  state’s \nprojected  deficit.    But,  on  June  4,  2009,  after  the  legislative  session  ended,  the \nCommissioner projected in a letter to the Governor that the state would still be short $2.7 \nbillion for the 2010-2011 biennium.  Because the Commissioner determined that probable \nD-2 \n \n\nreceipts would be less than anticipated and revenues were less than needed to satisfy the \nstate’s obligations for the 2010-2011 biennium, the Commissioner utilized the authority \nin section 16A.152, subdivision 4, to avoid deficit spending.   \n  This statute provides:   \n(a) If the commissioner determines that probable receipts for the \ngeneral fund will be less than anticipated, and that the amount available for \nthe remainder of the biennium will be less than needed, the commissioner \nshall, with the approval of the governor, and after consulting the Legislative \nAdvisory Commission, reduce the amount in the budget reserve account as \nneeded to balance expenditures with revenue. \n \nMinn. Stat. §  16A.152, subd. 4(a).  There were no funds in the budget reserve account \nthat could be used to balance the budget.  Accordingly, the Commissioner unallotted \nunder subdivision 4(b) of the statute, which provides:   \n(b) An additional deficit shall, with the approval of the governor, and \nafter  consulting  the  legislative  advisory  commission,  be  made  up  by \nreducing  unexpended  allotments  of  any  prior  appropriation  or  transfer.  \nNotwithstanding  any  other  law  to  the  contrary,  the  commissioner  is \nempowered to defer or suspend prior statutorily created obligations which \nwould prevent effecting such reductions. \n \nMinn. Stat. §  16A.152, subd. 4(b).   \n  There is no dispute in this case that the Commissioner sought and received the \napproval  of  the  Governor,  as  subdivision  4(b)  of  the  statute  required,  before  the \nunallotments were made.  The parties also agree that the Commissioner consulted with \nthe Legislative Advisory Commission before making any unallotments, as the statute also \nmandates.  But the parties dispute whether the Commissioner complied with the statute in \ntwo respects.  First, respondents contend that the unallotments did not comply with the \nstatute because, they argue, “probable receipts for the general fund” were not “less than \nD-3 \n \n\nanticipated.”  Minn. Stat. § 16A.152, subd. 4(a).  Second, respondents argue that the \nunallotments violated the statute because the Commissioner did not determine that the \n“amount available for the remainder of the biennium will be less than needed” when he \nunallotted.1  Id. \nThe parties each contend that the plain language of the statute  supports their \nposition, and, they argue in the alternative, that if we were to determine that the statute is \nambiguous, principles of statutory construction counsel that we construe the statute in \ntheir favor.  The majority concludes that the parties’ different readings of the statute are \nreasonable  and  that  therefore  the  statute  is  ambiguous.    The  majority  uses  its \ndetermination of ambiguity as an invitation to rewrite the statute to include the condition \nprecedent  of  a  balanced  budget.    Specifically,  the  majority  divines  that  what  the \nLegislature meant to say was that once a balanced budget has been enacted into law and a \ndeficit thereafter occurs, the Commissioner may unallot to make up that deficit.  The \nobvious problem with this rewrite is that it is a rewrite.  The Legislature chose not to \ninclude the condition precedent the majority finds necessary, and we cannot, under the \nguise of statutory construction, add it.  See Minn. Stat. § 645.16 (2008) (“When the words \nof a law in their application to an existing situation are clear and free from all ambiguity, \nthe letter of the law shall not be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing the spirit.”).  \n                                              \n1   Even though the unallotments were made under paragraph (b) of subdivision 4, the \nparties agree that the threshold determinations set forth in paragraph (a) (“that probable \nreceipts for the general fund will be less than anticipated” and “that the amount available \nfor the remainder of the biennium will be less than needed”) operate to constrain the \nCommissioner’s decision-making.   \nD-4 \n \n\nOur task instead is to read the words and apply them as the Legislature wrote them.   \nPhelps  v.  Commonwealth  Land  Title  Ins.  Co.,  537  N.W.2d  271,  274  (Minn.  1995) \n(“Where  the  intention  of  the  legislature  is  clearly  manifested  by  plain  unambiguous \nlanguage . . . no construction is necessary or permitted.”).  I turn now to that task and \nconsider the two specific provisions in the statute at issue. \nA.  Were Probable Receipts Less than Anticipated? \nRespondents  argue,  and  the  district  court  held,  that  the  Commissioner’s \nunallotments  violated  the  statute  because  the  budget  deficit  was  not  “previously \nunforeseen.”  Respondents’ argument is based on the fact that the budget deficit was \nknown  in  February  when  the  Commissioner  prepared  the  forecast.    Moreover, \nrespondents contend that when the Governor signed appropriation legislation and vetoed \nrevenue legislation, the Governor (and therefore the Commissioner) knew that the state \nwould not have funds sufficient to satisfy the financial obligations in the appropriation \nlegislation.  Therefore, respondents argue, the budget deficit was not unanticipated. \n  Even assuming the factual predicates for respondents’ arguments, I would hold \nthat  the  Commissioner  complied  with  the  plain  language  of  the  unallotment  statute.  \nWhen we construe statutes, our obligation is to determine whether the statute is plain on \nits face.  State v. Peck, 773 N.W.2d 768, 772 (Minn. 2009).  If so, the role of the judiciary \nis to apply the language as it is written.  See id. at 773 (“We have no opportunity to \nignore part of the legislature’s definition.”); State v. Jesmer, 293 Minn. 442, 442, 196 \nN.W.2d 924, 924 (1972) (“In construing statutes, we have said that where language is \nD-5 \n \n\nunambiguous, the clearly expressed intent must be given effect and there is no room for \nconstruction.” (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted)).   \nThe  statute  requires  that  the  Commissioner  determine  that  “probable \nreceipts . . . will be less than anticipated.”  Minn. Stat. § 16A.152, subd. 4(a).  Plainly, the \nCommissioner must make this determination before he unallots.  But the statute does not \nprovide any other deadline by which the Commissioner is to make this determination.  \nSee id.  The Legislature could have imposed temporal restrictions on the Commissioner’s \ndecision-making  if  that  was  its  intention,  but  it  chose  not  to  do  so  in  this  statute.  \nSpecifically, the Legislature could have written into the statute the requirement that the \nCommissioner may unallot only where a budget deficit arises that was not projected in \nthe most recent budget forecast.  The Legislature also could have added a provision \nrequiring the Commissioner to make the determination, within the biennium itself, that \n“probable receipts . . . will be less than anticipated.”  The Legislature did not do so, and \nas we have repeatedly recognized, it is not for the judiciary to insert such restrictions.  \nSee e.g., Reiter v. Kiffmeyer, 721 N.W.2d 908, 911 (Minn. 2006) (expressly declining to \nread time requirements into a statute because “we will not read into a statute a provision \nthat  the  legislature  has  omitted,  either  purposefully  or  inadvertently”);  Morrison  v. \nMendenhall, 18 Minn. 232 (Gil. 212, 218-20) (1872) (declining to interpret a foreclosure \nD-6 \n \n\nstatute  as  containing  additional  requirements  because  the  Legislature  rather  than  the \ncourts must be the source of any modifications to the statute as written).2   \nThere likewise is no requirement in the statute that the Commissioner determine \nthe cause of the budget deficit before he may unallot.  Which of the two coordinate \nbranches of government is responsible for the budget shortfall now facing Minnesota is \nthe subject of many pages of debate in this litigation.  The judiciary is not the venue to \nresolve this dispute.  See In re McConaughy, 106 Minn. 392, 415, 119 N.W. 408, 417 \n(1909)  (“Many  questions  arise  which  are  clearly  political,  and  not  of  judicial \ncognizance.”).  Moreover, even if the judicial branch were inclined to wade into this \ndispute, it would be irrelevant in this case because there is nothing in section 16A.152 \nthat limits the Commissioner’s authority to unallot depending upon what or who is most \nresponsible for the budget shortfall.  The judiciary cannot rewrite the statute to add such \nrestrictions.   \n                                              \n2   See also Greene v. Comm’r of Minn. Dep’t of Human Servs., 755 N.W.2d 713, \n722 (Minn. 2008) (noting that it is not the “proper function” of the judiciary to add “a \nright  into  the  statute”);  Beardsley  v.  Garcia,  753  N.W.2d  735,  740  (Minn.  2008) \n(declining to interpret the statute so as to “effectively rewrite” it because that prerogative \nbelongs to the Legislature rather than to the court); Goldman v. Greenwood, 748 N.W.2d \n279, 285 (Minn. 2008) (“The policy-based argument advanced by the dissent regarding \nwhen  to  measure  the  endangerment  to  the  child  is  not  without  merit,  but  such  a \ndetermination belongs to the legislature, not to this court.”); State v. Rodriguez, 754 \nN.W.2d 672, 684 (Minn. 2008) (explaining that it is the province of the Legislature, not \nthe  courts,  to  expand  an  accomplice  corroboration  statutory  requirement  to  jury \nsentencing trials); Isles Wellness, Inc. v. Progressive N. Ins. Co., 703 N.W.2d 513, 524 \n(Minn.  2005)  (explaining  that,  while  some  of  the  original  policy  considerations \nsupporting the corporate practice of medicine may need reexamination, the Legislature, \nnot  the  courts,  is  the  appropriate  forum  to  enact  such  policy  change);  Haghighi  v. \nRussian-Am. Broad. Co., 577 N.W.2d 927, 930 (Minn. 1998) (“If the literal language of \nthis statute yields an unintended result, it is up to the legislature to correct it.”). \nD-7 \n \n\n  The unallotment statute simply requires that the Commissioner determine whether \n“probable  receipts  for  the  general  fund  will  be  less  than  anticipated.”    Minn.  Stat. \n§ 16A.152, subd. 4(a).  This phrase is not ambiguous in my view, and I would hold that \nthe Commissioner made the necessary determination.  Specifically, he concluded, in his \nJune 4, 2009, letter, that “[y]ear to date receipts for FY 2009 are down $70.3 million \ncompared to the February forecast.  Nearly all major revenue categories have collected \nless than anticipated.”  Respondents make no argument that these determinations were \narbitrary or inaccurate in any way.  See In re Excess Surplus Status of Blue Cross & Blue \nShield  of  Minn.,  624  N.W.2d  264,  277  (Minn.  2001)  (noting  that  an  “agency’s \nconclusions are not arbitrary and capricious so long as a rational connection between the \nfacts  found  and  the  choice  made  has  been  articulated”  (citation  omitted)  (internal \nquotation marks omitted)).  Because the Commissioner complied with the plain language \nof the statute and respondents have not demonstrated that his determination was arbitrary \nand capricious, I would uphold the Commissioner’s determination that “probable receipts \nfor the general fund [were] less than anticipated.”   \nB.  Was the Amount Available for the Remainder of the Biennium Less than \nNeeded? \n \n  Respondents  argue  that  the  Commissioner’s  unallotments  violated  the  statute \nbecause the unallotments covered the entire biennium.  Respondents contend that whether \nfunds are available for the remainder of the biennium cannot be determined until some \npoint after the biennium has begun.  Accordingly, respondents argue, unallotments that \ncover the entire biennium and determinations that are made prior to the start of the \nD-8 \n \n\nbiennium violate the plain language of the statute.  The Commissioner contends that the \n“remainder  of  the  biennium,”  referred  to  in  Minn.  Stat.  § 16A.152,  subd.  4(a),  can \ninclude the entire biennium.  In the alternative, the Commissioner argues that even under \nrespondents’ interpretation of “remainder,” the unallotment at issue in this case—for the \nSpecial  Diet  Program—was  not  effective  until  November  1,  2009,  well  into  the \nbiennium.   \n  The parties’ disagreement as to the meaning of “remainder” in the statute appears \nto be the basis upon which the majority concludes that the statute is ambiguous.  In my \nview, we need not reach the question of whether the word “remainder” can refer to the \nwhole biennium or refers to a period that is less than the whole.   \n  The only question presented in this case is whether the decision to unallot funds \nfrom the Special Diet Program complies with the statute.  As to the Special Diet Program, \nthe  Commissioner  determined  that  “the  amount  available  for  the  remainder  of  the \nbiennium will be less than needed”; that is, the amount available, starting November 1, \nwould be less than needed to fund the Special Diet Program for the remainder of the \nbiennium.  Further, there is no dispute that the Special Diet Program funds were not \nunalloted until November 1.  The Commissioner’s determination that there would be \ninsufficient funds for this program was, indisputably, only with respect to a portion of the \nbiennium and not the entire biennium.  We therefore have no occasion in this case to \ndetermine  whether  decisions  to  unallot  that  were  effective  on  the  first  day  of  the \nbiennium violate the statute.  Because the unallotment decision at issue in this case \nconcerned only part of the biennium and the unallotment was not effective until several \nD-9 \n \n\nmonths  into the biennium, the Commissioner’s actions complied with the statute no \nmatter how “remainder” is defined.    \n  In sum, I would not reach out to decide more than the narrow question directly \npresented here.  As applied to the unallotment at issue in this case—the unallotment from \nthe Special Diet Program—the statute is not ambiguous, and the Commissioner complied \nwith the plain language the Legislature wrote in the statute.  See Minn. Stat. § 645.16 \n(directing that we are to look to see whether “the words of a law in their application to an \nexisting situation are clear and free from all ambiguity” (emphasis added)).  I would so \nhold.   \nII. \n  Respondents argue that if the Commissioner’s unallotment from the Special Diet \nProgram did not violate the unallotment statute, then the statute is unconstitutional as a \nviolation  of  the  separation  of  powers  doctrine.    Because  I  would  conclude  that  the \nCommissioner complied with the statute, it is necessary for me to reach the constitutional \nissue respondents raise.   \n  We are extremely reluctant to declare a statute unconstitutional and will do so \n“only when absolutely necessary.”  In re Haggerty, 448 N.W.2d 363, 364 (Minn. 1989).  \nOur precedent requires “every presumption” to be “invoked in favor of upholding [a] \nstatute” that is challenged on constitutional grounds.  State v. Schwartz, 628 N.W.2d 134, \n138 (Minn. 2001).  Because “Minnesota statutes are presumed constitutional,” those who \nchallenge the constitutionality of a statute bear a heavy burden in making this challenge.   \nIn re Haggerty, 448 N.W.2d at 364.  In order to succeed, respondents must demonstrate \nD-10 \n \n\n“beyond a reasonable doubt that the statute is unconstitutional.”  State v. Merrill, 450 \nN.W.2d 318, 321 (Minn. 1990).  I would hold that respondents have not met their heavy \nburden to show, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the statute is unconstitutional. \n  Our  constitution  divides  the  “powers  of  government  .  .  .  into  three  distinct \ndepartments:    legislative,  executive  and  judicial.”    Minn.  Const.  art.  III,  § 1.    The \nconstitution  also  prohibits  any  “person[]  belonging  to  or  constituting  one  of  these \ndepartments [from] exercis[ing] any of the powers properly belonging to either of the \nothers except in the instances expressly provided in this constitution.”  Id.  Respondents \nargue that the unallotment statute violates the separation of powers because in the statute, \nthe Legislature delegated pure legislative authority to the Commissioner.  I disagree. \n  Where one branch purports to perform completely a function assigned to one of \nthe other branches, such encroachment violates the separation of powers principle.  See \nLee v. Delmont, 228 Minn. 101, 112-13, 36 N.W.2d 530, 538 (1949) (noting that “purely \nlegislative power cannot be delegated” and that “[p]ure legislative power . . . is the \nauthority to make a complete law”).  We have recognized that such encroachment into \nthe judiciary’s sphere of constitutional responsibility is unconstitutional.  For example, \nwhere the Legislature purports to remove from the judiciary a class of cases that the \nconstitution vests in the judiciary, the Legislature has violated the separation of powers \ndoctrine.  Holmberg v. Holmberg, 588 N.W.2d 720, 726 (Minn. 1999) (holding that \n“[t]he  administrative  [child  support]  process  violates  separation  of  powers  and  is \nunconstitutional”); see also Quam v. State, 391 N.W.2d 803, 809 (Minn. 1986) (holding \nthat  the  Workers’  Compensation  Court  of  Appeals  “went  beyond  the  quasi-judicial \nD-11 \n \n\nauthority delegated to it to determine facts and answer questions of law as they arise \nunder the Workers’ Compensation Act and sought to assume the power to determine the \nvalidity of a duly promulgated rule of another agency” and the court “thereby exceeded \nthe scope of adjudicative power the legislature delegated to the agency consistent with \nthe constitutional doctrine of separation of powers”).    \n  Our separation of powers analysis therefore requires that we examine the function \nat  issue  and  determine,  as  a  threshold  matter,  whether  the  constitution  assigns  that \nfunction exclusively to one branch in our constitution.  See Irwin v. Surdyk’s Liquor, 599 \nN.W.2d 132, 141-42 (Minn. 1999) (“Legislation that prohibits this court from deviating \nfrom the precise statutory amount of awardable attorney fees impinges on the judiciary’s \ninherent power to oversee attorneys and attorney fees by depriving this court of a final, \nindependent review of attorney fees.  This legislative delegation of attorney regulation \nexclusively to the executive branch of government violates the doctrine of separation of \npowers.”).  In the case before us, the function at issue is the spending of state revenue.  \nMore specifically, the function is ensuring that the state does not deficit spend because \nour constitution restricts deficit spending.  See Minn. Const. art. XI, § 6 (“No certificates \n[of  indebtedness]  shall  be  issued  in  an  amount  which  .  .  .  will  exceed  the  then \nunexpended balance of all money which will be credited to that fund during the biennium \nunder existing laws.”).   \n  The constitution assigns the responsibility to ensure that the state does not deficit \nspend to both the legislative and executive branches.  See New England Div. of the Am. \nCancer Soc’y v. Comm’r of Admin., 769 N.E.2d 1248, 1256 (Mass. 2002) (recognizing \nD-12 \n \n\nthat passing laws authorizing spending is a legislative function and that spending state \nrevenue is an executive function).  The constitution assigns this function in part to the \nLegislature because “[n]o money shall be paid out of the treasury of this state except in \npursuance of an appropriation by law.”  Minn. Const. art. XI, § 1.  And the constitution \nassigns this function in part to the executive branch because the executive branch “shall \ntake care that the laws be faithfully executed.” Minn. Const. art. V, § 3.  As part of the \nfaithful execution of the law, the executive branch implements the appropriation laws \nthrough the spending of state revenue.  See Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 732-33 \n(1986) (describing “authority to determine the budget cuts to be made” to balance the \nfederal  budget  “as  plainly  entailing  execution  of  the  law  in  constitutional  terms”); \nOpinion of the Justices to the Senate, 376 N.E.2d 1217, 1222 (Mass. 1976) (noting that \n“the activity of spending money is essentially an executive task”).  The executive branch \nmust also faithfully execute the constitutional prohibition against deficit spending.  See \nMinn. Const. art. XI, § 6.  In ensuring that all laws, including appropriation laws and the \nconstitution, are faithfully executed, the executive “is bound to apply his full energy and \nresources, in the exercise of his best judgment and ability, to ensure that the intended \ngoals of legislation are effectuated.”  Opinion of the Justices, 376 N.E.2d at 1221; see \nalso  Bowsher,  478  U.S.  at  733  (“Interpreting  a  law  enacted  by  [the  Legislature]  to \nimplement the legislative mandate is the very essence of ‘execution’ of the law.”).3    \n                                              \n3   In  Bowsher,  Congress  passed  a  law  that  gave  the  Comptroller  General  the \nauthority to mandate which budget cuts the President had to make in the event of a \nfederal budget deficit.  478 U.S. at 717-18.  Because Congress had the authority to \n(Footnote continued on next page.) \nD-13 \n \n\n  Because the function is one that the constitution commits to both branches, the \nunallotment  statute—which  simply  acknowledges  this  joint  responsibility—does  not \ndelegate  pure  legislative  authority  to  the  executive  branch  and  it  does  not  violate \nseparation of powers.  There are many instances in the operation of government, such as \nthe prohibition against deficit spending, where the function at issue requires responsible \neffort from both of the political branches.  Such “cooperative ventures” do not violate the \nseparation of powers.  Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 371-72 (1989) (holding \nthat congressional creation of United States Sentencing Guidelines Commission did not \nviolate separation of powers).   \n  Precedent from the U.S. Supreme Court and from our court recognizes that within \nareas of joint responsibility— like that at issue here— the branches may seek assistance \nfrom one another without running afoul of the separation of powers.  The unallotment \nstatute recognizes that the Legislature needs assistance from the executive branch in \ndetermining how best to execute spending priorities when, because of the constitutional \nrestriction on deficit spending, an appropriation law cannot be fully executed.  The statute \ndoes not give the executive branch the authority to make or unmake the law.  Instead, the \nstatute  embodies  an  acknowledgement  of  the  responsibility  that  the  legislative  and \n \n(Footnote continued from previous page.) \nremove the Comptroller General, the Supreme Court found the statute unconstitutional.  \nId. at 732-33.  Specifically, the statute was unconstitutional because it vested executive \nauthority in the hands of an office within the legislative branch.  Id. at 733-34. \n \nD-14 \n \n\nexecutive branches share for managing our state’s budget, and it provides an opportunity \nfor the political branches to work cooperatively within the confines of our constitution.4  \n  As  former  Chief  Justice  Taft  explained,  “[i]n  determining  what  it  may  do  in \nseeking assistance from another branch, the extent and character of that assistance must \nbe fixed according to common sense and the inherent necessities of the governmental co-\nordination.”   J.W. Hampton, Jr.,  &  Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 394, 406 (1928) \n(concluding that a statute that authorized the President to increase tariff rates on foreign \n                                              \n4   This  principle  of  cooperation  is  central  to  the  budget-making  and  oversight \nprocess  in  Minnesota.    Although  the  Legislature  determines  appropriations,  it  is  the \nCommissioner that oversees the allotment process.  An “[a]llotment” is “a limit placed by \nthe commissioner on the amount to be spent or encumbered during a period of time \npursuant to an appropriation.”  Minn. Stat. §  16A.011, subd. 3 (2008).  The Legislature \napproves appropriations for agencies, but leaves the determination of the actual spending \nplans to the agencies.  See Minn. Stat. § 16A.14, subd. 3 (2008).  Agencies submit their \nspending plans to the Commissioner; those plans must certify that “the amount required \nfor  each  activity  is  accurate  and  is  consistent  with  legislative  intent.”    Id.    The \nCommissioner, not the Legislature, then reviews the spending plans to determine whether \nthey are “within the amount and purpose of the appropriation.”  Minn. Stat. § 16A.14, \nsubd. 4 (2008).  The Legislature has very broadly charged the Commissioner with the \ntask  of  determining  whether  these  spending  plans  are  within  the  purpose  of  the \nappropriation.  The Commissioner may even “modify the spending plan and the allotment \nto conform with the appropriation and the future needs of the agency.”  Id.  This authority \nto  review  spending  plans,  approve  them,  or  modify  them  along  with  allotments,  is \ndifferent  than  unallotment,  but  reflects  the  Legislature’s  recognition  that  the \nCommissioner’s exercise of the spending power requires the executive branch to discern \nand adhere to the legislative purpose in the appropriations.  See Bowsher, 478 U.S. at \n733.  Stated another way, inherent in the Commissioner’s authority to “allot” (i.e., place a \nlimit on the amount of money to be spent pursuant to an appropriation) is the necessity \nthat the Commissioner be guided by his determination of legislative priorities.  The \nLegislature does not give the Commissioner a definitive set of guidelines in discerning \nlegislative purpose and priorities embodied in the appropriations when the Commissioner \nis  making allotments; rather, the  Legislature gives the  Commissioner broad, flexible \nauthority in making allotments based on his identification of legislative priorities and \npurpose.     \n \nD-15 \n \n\nproducts was not a delegation of legislative authority to the President in violation of \nseparation of powers even though the Constitution vested in Congress the power to levy \nduties).  Specifically with regard to the legislative branch seeking assistance from the \nexecutive branch, so long as “Congress shall lay down by legislative act an intelligible \nprinciple to which the person or body authorized to [exercise the delegated authority] is \ndirected to conform, such legislative action is not a forbidden delegation of legislative \npower.”  Id. at 409. \n  We have likewise recognized that “some interference between the branches does \nnot undermine the separation of powers; rather, it gives vitality to the concept of checks \nand balances critical to our notion of democracy.”  Wulff v. Tax Court of Appeals, 288 \nN.W.2d 221, 223 (Minn. 1979) (noting that a “strict interpretation of the separation of \npowers  doctrine  would  make  the  existence  and  functioning  of  .  .  .  agencies  nearly \nimpossible”).  And we have embraced the “intelligible principle” standard from Hampton \nin our own separation of powers jurisprudence.  See Lee v. Delmont, 228 Minn. 101, 113 \nn.10, 36 N.W.2d 530, 539 n.10 (1949) (citing Hampton, 276 U.S. at 409).   \n  Specifically, we have held that “the legislature may authorize others to do things \n(insofar as the doing involves powers which are not exclusively legislative) which it \nmight properly, but cannot conveniently or advantageously, do itself.”  Id. at 112-13, 36 \nN.W.2d at 538.  Such legislative authorization does not offend the separation of powers \nas long as the Legislature provides a sufficient check in the form of a “reasonably clear \npolicy or standard of action which controls and guides the administrative officers in \nascertaining the operative facts to which the law applies.”  Id. at 113, 36 N.W.2d at 538.  \nD-16 \n \n\nThe law must “take[] effect upon these facts by virtue of its own terms, and not according \nto the whim or caprice of the administrative officers.”  Id.  If this check exists on the \nexecutive  branch’s  exercise  of  authority,  the  “discretionary  power  delegated  to  the \n[executive branch] is not legislative,” and there is no separation of powers violation.  Id. \nat 113, 36 N.W.2d at 538-39.  We have also recognized “that what is a sufficiently \ndefinite declaration of policy and standard varies in degree according to the complexity \nof the subject to which the law is applicable.”  Anderson v. Comm’r of Highways, 267 \nMinn. 308, 309, 315, 126 N.W.2d 778, 779, 782-83 (1964) (holding that a statute that \ndelegated authority to commissioner of highways to suspend driver’s license where driver \n“is an habitual violator” was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority).  \nThe unallotment statute satisfies the rule we applied in Lee and Anderson. \n  The statute sets forth the “controls” that guide the Commissioner.  Lee, 228 Minn. \nat 113, 36 N.W.2d at 538.  The Commissioner cannot unallot unless “probable receipts \nfor the general fund will be less than anticipated” and “the amount available for the \nremainder of the biennium will be less than needed.”  Minn. Stat. §  16A.152, subd. 4(a).  \nOnce these determinations are made, the Commissioner must first exhaust the budget \nreserve account before invoking the unallotment authority.   Id.; see also Minn. Stat. \n§ 16A.152, subd. 4(b), (c).  All of the determinations necessary to trigger the statute are \nD-17 \n \n\nobjectively verifiable and remove the unallotment authority from the mere “whim or \ncaprice” of the Commissioner.  Lee, 228 Minn. at 113, 36 N.W.2d at 538.5   \n  But these triggers are not the only controls on the Commissioner’s discretion.  To \nthe contrary, the Legislature has restricted the scope of the Commissioner’s unallotment \nauthority in several additional and clear ways.  First, the Commissioner may only unallot \nto the extent necessary to prevent deficit spending.  See Minn. Stat. §  16A.152, subd. \n4(b)  (“An  additional  deficit  shall  .  .  .  be  made  up  by  reducing  unexpended \nallotments . . . .”).   The unallotment itself does not impact the appropriation legislation; it \nmerely delays incurring the obligation until revenue is in place to pay for it.  \n  Second, before the Commissioner may unallot, the Commissioner must “consult[] \nthe legislative advisory commission.”  Id.  “Consult” means “to ask the advice or opinion \nof” and “to deliberate together.”  Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary 248 (10th ed. \n1993).    Our  precedent  requires  that  “every  presumption”  be  “invoked  in  favor  of \nupholding  the  statute,”  which  necessarily  means  that  we  must  give  force  to  the \nCommissioner’s obligation to seek the advice of and to deliberate with the legislative \nbranch.  See State v. Schwartz, 628 N.W.2d 134, 138 (Minn. 2001).  Through the required \nconsultation with the Legislative Advisory Commission, a group that includes the leaders \n                                              \n5   These triggers also demonstrate that this statute is not in any way similar to the \nstatute at issue in the case the concurrence cites, State v. Great Northern Railway Co., \n100  Minn.  445,  479,  111  N.W.  289,  294  (1907)  (suggesting  that  if  statute  charged \ncommission with “supervis[ion] [of] the issuance of only such stock as is authorized by \nlaw,” and with “the duty of ascertaining in each case whether the proposed increase is for \nan authorized purpose and in accordance with the requirements of the law,” the statute \nwould have been constitutional). \n \nD-18 \n \n\nfrom  both  houses  of  the  Legislature,6  the  executive  branch  receives  the  benefit  of \nguidance  as  to  legislative  priorities  and  concerns.    See  R.E.  Short  Co.  v.  City  of \nMinneapolis, 269 N.W.2d 331, 337 (Minn. 1978) (“In the absence of evidence to the \ncontrary, public officials, administrative officers, and public authorities, within the limits \nof  the  jurisdiction  conferred  upon  them  by  law,  will  be  presumed  to  have  properly \nperformed their duties in a regular and lawful manner and not to have acted illegally or \nunlawfully . . . .” (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted)).  By requiring that \nthe  Commissioner  ask  the  advice  of  and  deliberate  with  the  Legislative  Advisory \nCommission  before  the  Commissioner  unallots,  the  Legislature  has  provided  an \nimportant check on the Commissioner’s decision-making.   \n  Third, the Legislature has prioritized the areas from which the Commissioner may \nunallot by specifically exempting several funds from the unallotment authority.  See, e.g., \nMinn. Stat. §  16A.14, subd. 2a(1) (2008) (noting that the allotment system does not \napply to appropriations for the judiciary or the Legislature); Minn. Stat. § 16A.14, subd. \n2a(2) (2008) (providing exemption for unemployment benefits); Minn. Stat. § 16B.85, \nsubd.  2(e)  (2008)  (providing  that  the  risk  management  fund  “is  exempt  from  the \nprovisions of section  16A.152, subdivision 4”); Minn. Stat. § 477A.011, subd. 36(y) \n(2009 Supp.) (providing that “[t]he payment under this paragraph is not subject to . . . any \nfuture unallotment of the city aid under section 16A.152”).    \n                                              \n6   See Minn. Stat. § 3.30, subd. 2 (2008) (listing members of Legislative Advisory \nCommission).   \nD-19 \n \n\n  Fourth,  of  those  funds  that  the  Legislature  has  directed  are  available  for \nunallotment (in other  words, those programs the Legislature has  not exempted from \nunallotment), the Legislature has further constrained the executive branch.  Specifically, \nthe Legislature requires that the Commissioner “reduce allotments . . . by the amount of \nany saving that can be made over previous spending plans through a reduction in prices \nor  other  cause,”  and  directs  that  the  Commissioner  “may  consider  other  sources  of \nrevenue available to recipients of state appropriations and may apply allotment reductions \nbased on all sources of revenue available.”  Minn. Stat. §  16A.152, subd. 4(d), (e).  Fifth, \nonce an unallotment has been made, the Commissioner must, within 15 days, notify four \ndifferent committees of the Legislature of the decision.  Minn. Stat. §  16A.152, subd. 6 \n(2008).    \n  Finally, the Legislature, of course, remains free in the next legislative session to \nundo the unallotments as it has done in the past.  See, e.g., Minn. Stat. § 41A.09, subd. \n3a(h) (2008) (requiring that the Commissioner “reimburse ethanol producers for any \ndeficiency in payments . . . because of unallotment”).  The fact that the Legislature \nretains,  and  has  exercised,  the  authority  to  undo  the  Commissioner’s  unallotments \nprovides an important check on the Commissioner’s exercise of discretion.  This check is \nnot unlike the check we have found relevant within our own sphere in the opportunity for \nour review of decisions from executive branch “courts.”   See, e.g., Mack  v. City of \nMinneapolis,  333  N.W.2d  744,  753  (Minn.  1983)  (finding  that  the  “power”  of  the \nWorkers’ Compensation Court of Appeals, an executive branch court, “to set attorney \nfees is constitutionally permissible, because these awards are reviewable by this court”). \nD-20 \n \n\nBut  cf.  Holmberg  v.  Holmberg,  588  N.W.2d  720,  725  n.36  (Minn.  1999)  (“[T]he \navailability of judicial review alone will not provide adequate judicial supervision to \nprotect a system against a separation of powers challenge.”).  If the opportunity for \njudicial  review  in  our  court  is  a  relevant  check  of  executive  branch  “courts,”  logic \ndictates that a similar check in the legislative branch is likewise relevant to a separation \nof powers challenge to the unallotment statute.   \n  In sum, the unallotment statute provides objectively verifiable triggers for the \nCommissioner’s unallotment authority.  It defines the scope of what the Commissioner \nmay unallot—only funds sufficient to resolve the deficit.  It prioritizes the funds from \nwhich the Commissioner may not unallot, and for those funds available, it provides \nfurther guidance as to how the Commissioner is to unallot from those funds.  It requires \nthat the Commissioner work with the Legislative Advisory Commission in exercising the \nunallotment function.  Finally, the Legislature retains an important check through its \nability to undo the unallotments.  Our precedent compels the conclusion that there are \nsufficient  standards  in  this  statute.    This  is  especially  true  if  we  recall  that  every \npresumption is to be invoked in favor of upholding the constitutionality of a statute.  \nSchwartz, 628 N.W.2d at 138.7  \n                                              \n7   My  conclusion  that  the  statute  is  constitutional  is  in  accord  with  the  nearly \nunanimous  result  from  jurisdictions  around  the  country  that  have  upheld  the \nconstitutionality of similar unallotment statutes.  See Univ. of Conn. Chapter AAUP v. \nGovernor, 512 A.2d 152, 156-59 (Conn. 1986); Legislative Research Comm’n v. Brown, \n664 S.W.2d 907, 926-31 (Ky. 1984); New England Div. of the Am. Cancer Soc’y v. \nComm’r  of  Admin.,  769  N.E.2d  1248,  1256-58  (Mass.  2002);  N.D.  Council  of  Sch. \n(Footnote continued on next page.) \nD-21 \n \n\n  The issues presented here are only whether the Commissioner complied with the \nstatute, and whether the unallotment statute is constitutional.  Because I would hold that \nthe Commissioner complied with the plain language of the statute when he unallotted \nfrom the Special Diet Program, and that respondents have not met their heavy burden to \nprove that the unallotment statute is unconstitutional, I would reverse.   \n \nANDERSON, G.

Wattson, Senate Counsel, Legislative History of Una llotment Power, 4-13 \n(June 29, 2009) ................................................................................................................... 20 \nIII \n\nINTRODUCTION \nThe unallotments made by Appellants in the summer and fall of 2009 call \nsquarely into question the constitutionality of the statute on which they are based, \nMinnesota  Starute  § 16A.152,  subd.  4.  The manner in which Appellants have \nwielded this statute is unprecedented not only in its size and scope, but also in its \narbitrary  application.  If allowed  to  stand,  these  unallotments  will  represent a \nsignificant  and  dangerous  shift  in  power  from  the  Legislative  Branch  to  the \nExecutive Branch, permitting the Governor to engage in lawmaking with respect \nto the budget, spending levels and spending priorities.  Lawmaking is  a purely \nlegislative  function, however, and  it cannot be delegated to  any other branch of \ngovernment.  Maintaining separation of powers between governmental branches is \nessential  to  any  healthy  democracy, and  to  permit  the  centralization  of power \nclaimed here by the Executive Branch would open the door to a power that is more \nmonarchical than republican in nature. \nI \nARGUMENT \nI.  SEPARATION  OF  POWERS  Is  A  BASIC  TENET  OF  AMERICAN \nDEMOCRACY,  AND  THIS  COURT  MUST  CLOSELY  SCRUTINIZE  ANY \nSCHEME WHICH HAS THE POTENTIAL To CENTRALIZE POWER IN ONE \nBRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. \nThe  basic  concept of separation  of powers  is straigbtforward  and  well-\nestablished: \"Under the separation-of-powers doctrine, each branch of government \nPursuant to Minn. R. App. P. 129.03, amici curiae certifY that counsel for none of \n1 \nthe captioned parties authored  this brief, in  whole or  in  part, and  that no other \nperson or entity made a monetary contribution to the preparation or submission of \nthis brief. \n\nIS  prohibited  from  intruding  upon  another  branch's  unIque  constitutional \nfunctions.\"  Citizens  for  Rule  of Law  v.  Senate  Committee  on  Rules  and \nAdministration,  770  N.W.2d  169,  173  (Minn.  Ct.  App.  2009).  While  the \napplication of this doctrine has evolved over time, its underlying rationale remains \nunquestioned: \"The separation of powers doctrine is based on the principle that \nwhen the government's power is concentrated in one of its branches, tyranny and \nconuption will  result.\"  Holmberg v. Holmberg,  588 N.W.2d 720,  723  (Minn. \n1999). This concern predates not just the Constitution, but America itself: \nPolitical  philosophers  such  as  Locke  and  Montesquieu  were \nconcerned that if all power were concentrated in one branch of the \ngovernment,  tyranny  would  be  the  natural  and  probable  result. \nWhile their formulation of the actual workings of such a balanced \ngovernment has  been altered through the years, the basic principle \nremains: too much power in  the hands of one governmental branch \ninvites corruption and tyranny. \nWulffv. Tax Court ofA  ppeals, 288 N.W.2d 221, 222-23 (Minn. 1979). \nSeparation of powers is implicit but well-recognized  in the United States \nConstitution, see generally, Mistretta v.  United States, 488 U.S. 361, 381, 109 S. \nCt.  647,  659  (1989),  and  is  expressly  recognized  in  most  state  constitutions, \nincluding  the  MilUlesota  Constitution.  Minnesota's  Constitution  expressly \nprovides for the separation of powers into \"three distinct departments:  legislative, \nexecutive, and judicial.\"  See Minnesota Constitution, Art. III § l.  Usurpation of \npower by one branch from another is prohibited: \"No person or persons belonging \nto  or  constituting  one  of these  departments  shall  exercise  any  of the  powers \n2 \n\nproperly  belonging  to  either  of the  others  except  the  instances  expressly \nIn \nprovided for in this constitution.\" Id. \nMaintaining the separation of powers does not involve a bright-line rule; as \nthe task of governance has required more specialized decision-making, courts have \ntolerated an increased amount of friction among the three coordinate branches.  In \nparticular, Minnesota courts have joined the national trend of being more liberal in \npermitting  delegations  of discretionary  power  to  administrative  agencies  with \ntechnical expertise in  a particular area.  See generally Anderson v.  Comm'r of \nHighways,  126  N.W.2d 778, 780-81  (Minn.  1964);  Wulff,  288  N.W.2d at 223. \nWhile such discretionary delegations can involve important interests and become \nsources of considerable controversy, see,  e.g.,  State v.  Underdahl,  767 N.W.2d \n677 (Minn. 2009) (ordering production of computer source code for breath testing \ninstrument previously approved by the Commissioner of Public Safety pursuant to \nlegislative delegation), it is rare for opinions relating to these specialty delegations \nto contain words as strong as \"tyranny\" or \"corruption.\"  Such is not the case with \ndelegations which implicate the core power of another branch.  In those instances, \nthis  Court  has  consistently  expressed  concerns  about  the  foundations  of \ngovernment being subverted, and  it has  given such delegations of discretionary \npower close scrutiny, regardless of outcome. \nThis Court's decisions in WuljJv.  Tax Court of Appeals, 288 N.W.2d 221 \n(Minn.  1979), and Holmberg v.  Holmberg, 588 N.W.2d 720, 723  (Minn.  1999), \nare good examples of jlldicial caution and close scrutiny.  In Wulff, 288 N.W.2d at \n3 \n\n224-25,  this  Court held that the  creation  of the Minnesota  Tax  Court did  not \nrepresent an unconstitutional intrusion on the judicial branch, largely because the \nstatute creating that court did not fully divest original jurisdiction from the district \ncourt, nor did it eliminate the right to eventual judicial review.  By contrast, in \nHolmberg,  588  N.W.2d  at  726,  this  Court struck  down  a  statute  creating  an \n\"expedited\" child-support process because it did infringe on the district court's \noriginal jurisdiction and improperly conveyed  district court power to executive \nbranch administrative law judges. \nRegardless of outcome, this Court expressed the need for caution in both \ninstances.  In  Wulff- in which the challenged delegation was upheld - the Court \nobserved that while a strict interpretation of the separation of powers doctrine was \nimpractical, \"a too liberal interpretation could severely undennine the basis of our \ndemocratic system.\"  See Wulff, 288 N.W.2d at 223.  Holmberg clearly echoed the \nsame concern, with the Court holding that \"[t]he legislature's delegation of an area \nof the district court's original jurisdiction calls for this court's close scrutiny.\"  See \nHolmberg, 588 N.W.2d at 724.  Furthennore,  Wulff was clearly a close call and \nthis  Court  ended  its  opinion  with  cautionary  language,  stating  that  while  the \nunique nature of taxation power, coupled with judicial checks, ultimately saved \nthe tax  court statute, \"[w  ]e can envision circumstances  in which administrative \nadjudications could constitute an encroachment on the judicial power.\"  Wulff, 288 \nN.W.2d  at  225.  That  vision  of potential  encroachment  became  reality  in \nHolmberg, and this Court did not hesitate to act. \n4 \n\nThe  need  for  caution  and  close  scrutiny  extends  to  executive  branch \nreductions of legislative appropriations.  In Inter Faculty Organization v.  Carlson, \n478 N.W.2d 192 (Minn. 1991), this Court held that Governor Carlson's attempted \nline-item veto of some - but  not all - portions of an  appropriation  for  higher \neducation was unconstitutional.  In the course of its analysis, the Court recognized \nthe  basic proposition  that the  power to  appropriate  state  funds  is  a  legislative \npower, and observed that the governor's line-item veto authority is found not in \nthe  executive  branch  portions  of the  Minnesota  Constitution,  but  rather  was \nincluded as an exception in the legislative department article.  Id. at 194.  The \nCourt immediately  cited separation  of powers concerns:  \"As an  exception, the \npower must be narrowly construed to prevent an unwarranted usurpation by the \nexecutive of powers granted the legislature in the first instance.\" Id. \nThe above-cited cases have important implications that the Court should \nkeep in the forefront of its own analysis.  First, the separation of powers issue in \nthis case is not trivial or insubstantial.  To the contrary, the separation of powers \ndoctrine  is  clearly  implicated,  and  the  concerns  underlying  that  doctrine  run \nstraight to the foundation of our democracy.  As a result, and in order to prevent \nthe potential for centralization of power and abuse, the actions at issue in this case \nshould be given close scrutiny, and the powers claimed by the executive should be \nnarrowly construed. \n5 \n\nII.  MINNESOTA'S UNALWTMENT STATUTE CANNOT STAND BECAUSE, ON \nITS  FACE,  IT UNCONSTITUTIONALLY  DELEGATES  PURE LEGISLATIVE \nPOWER To THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. \nMinnesota's  unallotment  statute,  as  currently  written,  lS  facially \nunconstitutional because it provides a delegation of pure legislative power which \nallows the governor to engage in lawmaking without any meaningful participation \nby the legislature, effectively granting the governor a new veto power free from \nthe  threat of legislative override,  in  violation  of the  constitution's presentment \nclause.  See Minnesota Constitution, Art.  IV,  § 23.  Although  the  unallotment \nstatute has been on the books for decades, its previous use has been infrequent and \nrelatively  restrained.  Appellants'  attempt  to  apply  it  in  sweeping  fashion, \nhowever,  lays  bare  its  constitutional  infinnities.  Left  unchecked,  the  statute \nprovides the governor with the authority to not merely control spending levels, but \nalso to alter funding priorities in a way that allows him to de facto create wholly \nnew  legislation.  This  latter  authority  unconstitutionally  impinges  on  the \nlegislature's pure  legislative  power, and  if appellants'  actions were allowed to \nstand would represent a real and substantial shift of traditional legislative power \nfrom the legislative branch to the executive branch, leaving open the possibility of \nabuse. \nAlthough amici are deeply concerned about the negative impact appellants' \nactions could have on the balance of power in state government, they do not take \nthe position that unallotment power cannot be delegated to the executive under any \ncircumstances.  Rather, their contention is that any such delegation must contain \n6 \n\nsufficient checks to  ensure that  any  \"pure\" legislative power implicated  by  the \nunallotment process remains with the  legislature.  The inclusion of such checks \nhas been the deciding factor for virtually all courts nationwide that have examined \nthis issue, and amici believe that the absence of such checks should detennine the \nresult here.  Left unchecked, the governor can - at his whim - reduce specifically \nallocated funds  in  a range from  zero to one hundred percent, a fact graphically \nillustrated  by  Appellants'  reduction  or  elimination  of funding  for  programs  as \ndiverse  as  the MSA  Special  Diet  Program,  the Political  Contribution  Refund, \nLocal Government Aid, and the Property Tax Refund program. \nA.  Unallotment Is A Statutory Power, Not A Constitutional Power, \nAnd  Is  Therefore  Subject  To  Constraints  On  Delegation \nBetween Governmental Branches. \nThe power to unallot is not provided for in the Minnesota Constitution, but \ninstead is a creature of statute.  The unallotment statute in its original fonn was \npassed by the Legislature in 1939, in the midst of the Great Depression.  See Laws \nof Minnesota, Chapter 431, Art. II § 16.  In its current form, the statute provides in \nrelevant part that: \nIf the commissioner detennines that probable receipts for the general \nfund will be less than anticipated, and that the amount available for \nthe  remainder  of  the  bieIUlium  will  be  less  than  needed,  the \ncommissioner  shall,  with  the  approval  of the  governor,  and  after \nconsulting the Legislative Advisory Commission, reduce the amount \nin the budget reserve account as needed to balance expenditures with \nrevenue. \nMinn. Stat. § 16A.152, subd. 4(a). \n7 \n\nIn Lee v. Delmont, 36 N.W.2d 530, 538-39 (Minn. 1949), this Court set the \nbasic  parameters  for  determining  whether  a  particular  legislative  delegation \nviolates the separation of powers doctrine.  In that case, the Court stressed that \nwhile the Legislature can - and often does - delegate fact-finding authority to the \nexecutive branch in detennining whether a law's applicability has been triggered, \nthe Legislature must also provide meaningful guidance as to how that law is to be \nenforced: \nPure  legislative  power,  which  can  never  be  delegated,  is  the \nauthority to make a complete law - complete as to the time it shall \ntake effect and  as  to whom  it  shall  apply - and  to  determine the \nexpediency of its enactment. .. The power to ascertain facts, which \nautomatically brings a law into operation by virtue of its own terms, \nis not the power to pass, modifY, or annul a law.  If the law furnishes \na reasonably clear policy or standard of action which controls and \nguides the administrative officers in ascertaining the operative facts \nto which the law applies, so that the law takes effect upon these facts \nby virtue of its own terms, and not according to the whim or caprice \nafthe administrative officers, the discretionary power delegated ... is \nnot legislative. \nId.  In short, any delegation of legislative power to the executive branch must be \naccompanied by guidelines that inform the executive both of when the law must \nbe applied and of how it is to be applied.  Absent such guidance, the law can be \ninvoked unevenly, at the \"whim or caprice\" of the executive. \nB.  The  Absence  Of Constraints  On  Delegation  Has  Resulted  In \nUnaIlotm.nt  Statutes  In  Otber  States  Being  Held \nUnconstitutional. \nThe  presence  or  absence  of  meaningful  guidance  and  restraints  has \ndetermined the outcome of similar unallotment laws in other states.  In Fairbanks \n8 \n\nNorth Star Borough, and North Star Borough School District v. State ofA  laska et \naI., 736 P.2d 1140 (Alaska 1987), the Alaska Supreme Court was confronted with \na constitutional challenge to a statute strikingly similar to Minnesota's unallotment \nstatute.  At the outset, the Court noted both the breadth of the delegation to  the \ngovernor  and  the  absence of meaningful  limitations  and  guidance  on  how that \ndelegation was to be administered.  ld. at 1143.  The court also noted that \"[t]his is \nnot a case where the legislature has delegated broad authority to an agency with \nexpertise to regulate a narrowly defined field.\"  ld  Accordingly, the Alaska court \napplied  a  standard  of close  scrutiny,  and  ultimately  struck  down  the  statute, \nconcluding that its lack of standards left open the possibility of abuse: \nThe  legislature  has  articulated  no  principles,  intelligible  or \notherwise, to guide the executive.  Under [the unallotment statute], \nthe  governor  decides  when  projected  revenues  are  inadequate  to \nmeet appropriations.  Once he makes that detennination, he has total \ndiscretion as to which appropriations to cut and to what extent.  The \nstatute does not expressly require him to limit his cuts to the extent \nof the shortfall, nor does it provide for adjustment of the cuts to the \nactual revenues received ... The State conceded at oral argument that \nthe statute would permit the Governor to cut the entire budget for a \nparticular  department  or  project.  Indeed,  nothing  in  the  statute \nwould prevent him from effectively vetoing a project where his veto \nhad  been  previously  overridden.  An  appropriation  could  be \neliminated entirely, cut in half or left untouched.  In short, the effect \nof an exercise of authority under [the statute] is no more predictable \nthan the identity and priorities of our next governor. \nld \nSimilar concerns  regarding the  breadth  of power  and  lack  of standards \ndetermined the outcome in Chiles v. Children A, B, C, D, E, and F, 589 So.2d 260 \n(Fla.  1991),  in  which  Florida's  unallotment  statute  was  also  struck  down  as \n9 \n\nunconstitutional.  In its opinion, the Florida Supreme Court held that the power to \nunallot  amounted  to  an  unconstitutional  delegation  of  the  legislature's \nappropriation power: \nWe  construe  the  power  granted  in  [the  unallotment  statute]  as \nprecisely the power to appropriate ... [T]he constitutional efforts to \nset  forth  a  deliberate  veto  and  enforcement  mechanism  for  the \nexecutive branch would seem an elaborate exercise in futility if the \nGovernor and Cabinet, by stroke of the executive pen, could excise \nwhole  portions  of the  appropriations  act  and  totally  restructure \nlegislative priorities ... This delegation strikes at the very core afthe \nseparation of powers doctrine, and for this reason [the statute] must \nfail as unconstitutional. \nId. at 265-66. \nAlthough Fairbanks and Chiles are certainly the most-discussed opinions in \nthis  line,  other  state  courts  have  struck  down  similar  unallotment  statutes  or \npowers for essentially the same reasons.  See,  e.g., Colorado General Assembly v. \nLamm, 700 P.2d 508, 521 (Colo. 1985) (holding that while the governor has power \nto administer the state budget, that power does not extend to contradicting major \nlegislative detenninations); State ex rei. Schwartz v. Johnson, 907 P.2d 1001, 1002 \n(N.M.  1995) (\"[T]he fact  that respondent acted only  under certain self-imposed \nrestraints can in no way serve to supply what has been omitted.  It is not what has \nbeen  done  but  what  can  be  done  under  a  statute  that  determines  its \nconstitutionality.\"); State oj Nevada Employees Ass'n v.  Daines,  824 P.2d 276, \n279  (Nev.  1992)  (\"The  executive branch  has attempted to impound  the  funds \nspecifically appropriated for this salary increase in a manner that would defeat the \nlegislative  purpose  and  essentially  rewrite  the  act.  The  executive  is  not \n10 \n\nempowered  to  disregard  the  mandate  of the  legislature  that  certain  salaries  be \npaid.\"). \nIn  contrast,  the  Supreme  Court  of Vermont  has  explained  that  with \nsufficient guidance, the  power  to  unallot  need  not  necessarily  intrude  on  pure \nlegislative power.  See Hunter v.  State of Vermont, 865 A.2d 381  (VI. 2004).  In \nHunter, the court upheld a differently structured unallolment statute, holding that \nit provided sufficient safeguards to ensure that reductions in legislative allotments \ndid not unconstitutionally intrude on fundamental legislative power.  The Vermont \nstatute  barred  executive  unallotment  unless  three  factors  were  present:  (1) \nestimates from its emergency board must have shown that a fund was reduced in \nits previous estimate by at least 2%; (2) the General Assembly was not in session, \nand (3) a deficit-prevention plan was unecessary to ensure a balance budget.\"  Id. \nat 387.  In that instance, a Joint Fiscal Committee (\"JFC\") made up of members of \nthe legislature could \"accept, reject, or amend the plan\" prior to implementation. \nId.  at 385.  Absent such substantive checks, the court explained that a governor \n\"has a free hand to refuse to spend any appropriated funds, [and] can totally negate \na legislative policy decision that lies at the core of the legislative function.\"  Id. at \n384. \nC.  Minnesota's  Un allotment  Statute  Is  Facially  Unconstitutional \nBecause  It Attempts  to  Delegate  Pure Legislative  Power And \nContains No Meaningful Restrictions On The Executive Branch. \nThe present case should be decided in the same manner as Fairbanks and \nChiles.  Other  than  requiring  the  presence  of  an  unanticipated  shortfall, \n11 \n\nMinnesota's unallotment statute provides no clear policy or standard of action for \ndetermining when to unallot, how much to unallot, or in what areas to unallot.  In \nLee v.  Delmont, 36 N.W.2d at 538-39, this Court identified pure legislative power \nas \"the power to pass, modify, or annul a law.\"  These powers are disjunctive, and \nthe  power  to  perform  anyone  of these  tasks  should  be  considered  purely \nlegislative. \nHere, Appellants' actions have demonstrated in the clearest possible terms \nthat Minnesota's unallotment statute purports to convey the power to modify or \nannul  duly  enacted  appropriations  laws.  Although  this  appeal  concerns  the \nelimination of funding for just one program, the cuts made by Appellants -- in \ntheir  totality  -- are  real-world  examples  of the  hypothetical  abuses  which \nmotivated the result in Fairbanks.  What the court feared in Fairbanks, we have \nseen in Minnesota:  the governor truly can \"cut the entire budget for a particular \ndepartment or project. .. [and) an appropriation could be eliminated entirely, cut in \nhalf or left  untouched.\"  See Fairbanks,  736  P.2d at  1143.  In the absence of \nmeaningful  checks  and  balances,  the  application  of Minnesota's  unallotment \nstatute  \"is  no  more  predictable  than  the  identity  and  priorities  of our  next \ngovernor.\"  [d. \nIn addition to encompassing the power to modify or annul laws passed by \nthe  legislature,  Minnesota's  unallotment  statute  can  be  fairly  construed  as \nconveying the power to pass legislation with virtually no input from the legislature \nitself.  If there is one aspect of the legislative process that is as predictable as the. \n12 \n\nseasons, it is this: There will be an appropriations bill, and there will be a revenue \nbill.  Appellants have proven that if the executive branch wishes to exercise near \ntotal control over the appropriations process, all that need be done is to sign the \nappropriations  bill  and  veto  the  revenue  bilL  At  that  point,  MiIUlesota's \nunallotment  statute  can  be  invoked,  and  the  governor  can  reduce  or  eliminate \nfunding for a shockingly wide range of programs without any regard whatsoever \nfor the legislative priorities expressed in the original bill.  The potential for such a \nsweeping assertion of power is what caused the court in  Chiles to \"construe the \npower  granted  in  [Florida's  unal10tment  statute)  as  precisely  the  power  to \nappropriate.\"  589  So.2d  at 265.  \"The  legislative  responsibility  to  set  fiscal \npriorities through appropriations is totally abandoned when the power to reduce, \nnullitY, or  change those priorities is given over to  the total discretion of another \nbranch of government.\"  [d.  In the absence of meaningful guidance or restraints, \nthe \"whim or caprice\" of the executive branch that concerned this Court in Lee v. \nDelmont wil1 become our present reality, and Appel1ants have left little doubt that \nthe actions disputed in this case are likely to be repeated in the near future.  See \nBaird Helgeson, Pat Doyle, Pawlenty Digs In,  Will  Fight Budget Ruling, STAR \nTRIBUNE, Dec. 31, 2010 (quoting Appel1ant Governor Pawlenty as noting that the \nstate faces its worst financial hardship since World War II, and stating \"Ifw  e can't \nuse unallotment now, I don't know when we could.\"). \nIn  addition  to·  providing  a  delegation  of  legislative  power  that  is \nimpermissibly broad,  Minnesota's unallotment statute also allows a governor to \n13 \n\nunconstitutionally  evade the presentment clause of the Minnesota Constitution, \nArt. IV, § 23.  While the constitution does provide the governor with specific veto \npowers as an exception to the legislature's general power to make laws, see id., \nAppellants' use of the unallolment statute when the legislature is out of session \nshows  that  a  governor  can  effectively  veto  legislation  with  no  meaningful \nopportunity  for  legislative  override.  This  failing  demonstrates  graphically  the \nmanner in which the statute violates the separation of powers expressly provided \nfor  in  the Minnesota Constitution.  This Court must, therefore, strike down the \nstatute as unconstitutional. \nD.  Appell.nts  And  Their  Amici  Offer  Justific.tions  For  The \nUn.llotrnent Statute That Are IllUSOry. \nAppellants  and  their amici  curiae urge  the  opposite  result,  employing  a \nvariety of different rationales.  All should be rejected. \nI.  Appellants  and their amici err  in  asking  this  Court  to  be \nbroadly  protectiv.e  of the  governor's  executive  spending \npower, while narrowly construing the legislature's power to \nmake the budget and set legislative priorities. \nAmici Law Professors assert that the power contained in the unallotment \nstatute is not purely legislative because it involves the power to spend, which is a \nhallmark of executive branch power. See Brief of Amici Curiae· Law Professors at \n7-8.  Where amici  err in  their analysis is in their disregard  for  the concept of \nlegislative priority,  and  in  their over-reliance  on  federal precedent, which  is  a \nwholly separate body of law.  Amici's argument is asymmetrical, in that it makes \nexecutive  spending  power paramount over the  legislature's  power to  make the \n14 \n\nbudget and set spending priorities, despite the co-equal nature of the two branches. \nMinnesota's unallotment statute vests all these powers in the executive branch.  In \naddition to including the power to withhold funds, the unallotment statute conveys \non its face the power to prioritize spending, and the power to prioritize spending is \nthe power to make law, which is a purely legislative function.  Take, for example, \nthe following: \nIn  their brief, Amici Law Professors  observe that \"[cjost savings migbt \nmake it possible to spend less than the full  amount appropriated for a higbway \nproject.  No  separation-or-powers  principle  prevents  the  executive  from \nresponding  to  those situations  by  declining to  spend the  full  amount of every \nappropriation.\"  See Brief of Amici Curiae Law Professors at 7-8.  This assertion \nis  indisputably correct.  A governor who completes a higbway project  for  less \nmoney than was appropriated is the portrait of an effective executive; the will of \nthe  legislature has been executed and  cost savings  have resulted.  Contrast that \nexample with a governor who receives an appropriation for a highway project, but \nindependently  decides  that  cost  savings  are  paramount  and  makes  no  attempt \nwhatsoever to complete the project.  Cost savings have resulted, but what about \nthe will of the legislature?  Ifone ofa governor's key jobs is to execute the will of \nthe legislature, then the governor in this latter example can only be described as \nineffective and overreaching. \nWhat Amici Law Professors ignore is the fact that an appropriations bill is \nnot  just  a  cap  on  spending,  but  is  also  one  of the  most  concrete  possible \n15 \n\nexpressions of legislative will.  An appropriations bill  that  authorizes $100  for \npublic works and $10 for human services reflects very different priorities than an \nappropriations bill authorizing $100 for human services and $10 for public works. \nAbsent the power to totally re-write the bill, the governor has two choices: Veto \nthe measure or sign it and \"take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\"  See \nMinn. Const., Art. V, § 3.  Here, Appellants are claiming the power to totally re-\nwrite the bill, and if the final version -- enacted without any legislative consent --\nallocates $10 for public works and $10 for human services, one could be pardoned \nfor  asking  \"Why  have  a  legislature  at  all?\"  The  legislature's  voice  and  the \nlegislature's judgment has been totally quashed.  Amici have narrowly construed \nthe law-making power of the legislature, while tacitly asserting that the spending \npower of the executive cannot be limited or encroached upon, and pennitting the \ngovernor to completely avoid the threat of legislative override. \n2.  The persuasive precedent cited by Appellants and their amici \nis far from persuasive, in that it fails to anticipate or respond \nto assertions ofp ower oft he type or scale at issue here. \nAppellants and their amici also urge this Court to adopt two other decisions \nas persuasive precedent, New England Division o/the American Cancer Socy v. \nComm'r  of Administration,  769  N.E.2d  1248  (Mass.  2002),  and  the  Court  of \nAppeals'  decision  in  Rukavina  v.  Paw/enty,  684 N.W.2d 525  (Minn.  Ct.  App. \n2004), rev.  denied (Oct.  19, 2004).  Both cases were wrongly decided and should \nbe rejected. \n16 \n\nIn New England, 769 N.E.2d at 1257, the Massachusetts Supreme Court \nupheld that state's unallotment statute on the rationale that the law permitted the \ngovernor to unallot only \"in a time of true financial emergency.\"  The court rated \n\"[tlhe probability  that the Governor might abuse  her authority ... to  reduce, or \neliminate altogether, funding for certain programs based on her own ordering of \nsocial priorities\" as \"minimal\" because the Massachusetts Constitution bound the \ngovernor \"to ensure that the intended goals of legislation are effected.\" Id. \nThe problem with  this  analysis  is  that while  it  requires the  governor  to \nshow fealty to legislation, it leaves no role for the legislature.  If a governor can \nfundamentally  reorder  legislative appropriations without meaningful  input from \nthe legislature, then the role of the legislature is seriously reduced, and the balance \nof power  between  co-equal  branches  of government  is  seriously  tilted.  The \nMassachusetts Supreme Court simply discounted the possibility of unallotments \non the scale seen here, and the facts of this case graphically expose the faults  in \nthat  court's  reasoning,  including  the  failure  to  consider  the  chance  that  the \ngovernor  might  create  a  ''true  financial  emergency\"  by  approving  the \nappropriations  bill  and  then  vetoing  the  revenue  bill  immediately  after  the \nlegislative session ends. \nThe  court  in  New  England  was  also  swayed  by  the  argument  that \nunallotment means  merely  spending  less  money  than  authorized, and that  \"the \nunderlying appropriation remains fully in force to establish an upper limit on what \nmay be spent for that  line item, should sufficient revenue be forthcoming.\"  769 \n17 \n\nN.E.2d at  1257.  This argument is  purely semantic and should  be  rejected.  If \nfunding  for  construction  of a  bridge  is  completely  unalloted,  the  result  is  no \ndifferent than if the law authorizing its construction is simply vetoed: No bridge is \nbuilt.  This Court held in Lee v.  Delmont that nullification of an existing law is a \npurely legislative power.  To permit such nullification in the guise of unallotment \nwould effectively overturn that decision. \nRukavina v. Pawlenty, 684 N.W.2d 525 (Mirm. Ct. App. 2004), rev. denied \n(Oct.  19,  2004),  is  similarly  flawed.  In  that  decision,  the  court  treated \nconstitutionality  as  a side  issue  in  comparison  to  the  issues  of standing  and \nstatutory authorization. disposing of the question in les? than  a page.  No one in \nthat case anticipated the breadth of authority claimed here, in which the Governor \nclaims the power to unilaterally resolve a political deadlock at the very start of the \nbiennium wholly outside the normal system of checks and balances.  Furthermore, \nwhile the court correctly recited the definition of pure legislative power, it failed to \nrecognize  that  the  unallotment  statute  purports  to  convey  that  very  power. \nAccording to the court, \"[p]ure legislative power, which can never be delegated, is \nthe authority to make a complete law - complete as to the time it shall take effect \nand as to whom it shall apply - and to determine the expediency of its enactment.\" \nRukavina, 684 N.W.2d at 535.  Unallotment conveys that pure legislative power to \nthe governor, who alone detennines when to unallot, which programs to unallot, \nand whether to unallot at all - all free from the threat of override. \n18 \n\n3.  Minnesota's  unallotment  statute  contains  no  meaningful \nchecks on the exercise of legislative power by the governor. \nAmici Law Professors also assert, incorrectly, that Minnesota's unallotment \nstatute contains sufficient constraints on executive power, making it simi1ar to the \nVennont  unallotment  statute  upheld  in  Hunter.  See  Brief  of  Amici  Law \nProfessors at 15-17.  Unlike the checks outlined in Hunter, a brief examination of \nthe constraints claimed here reveals their illusory nature. \nFirst, amici claim limits on the circumstances in which unallotments may \nbe  made,  in  that \"[a]uthority  to  reduce allotments  is  not triggered  unless  'the \ncommissioner detennines that probable receipts for the general fund will be less \nthan anticipated, and that the amount available for the remainder of the biennium \nwill be less than needed.'\"  ld.  at  15  (quoting Minn.  Stat.  § 16A.152, subd. 4). \nWhile this statement is literally true, it affords no true protection if the governor \ncan simply create a deficit at wil1 when the legislature is out of session. \nSecond, amici claim that the legislature has provided sufficient guidance as \nto the purpose and priority of unallotments.  ld.  at 16.  A review of the provisions \ncited, however, reveals that the statute uses \"may\" in all  instances, other than the \ncommon-sense  provision  that  the  commissioner  \"shall\"  save  money  where \npossible.  See  id.  \"May\" is  not  a  limit,  and  while  it  may  be  some  fonn  of \nguidance, that guidance is constitutionally insufficient. \nThird,  amici  assert  that  the  statute  \"ensures  actual  guidance  by  the \nlegislatwe\" because of the requirement that the governor must first \"consult\" with \n19 \n\nthe Legislative Advisory Commission (\"LAC\") before engaging in unallotment. \nId  (emphasis in  original).  This argument is feeble at best,  and stands in sharp \ncontrast to the Joint Fiscal Commission found sufficient in Hunter, which had the \nability to \"accept, reject, or amend the [governor's] plan\" prior to implementation. \nSee Hunter, 865 A.2d at 385.  Despite heated rhetoric at its meetings this year, the \nLAC is in reality utterly toothless, that reality evidenced plainly by the fact that \nthe  Minnesota  House  has  weighed  in  on  behalf of Respondents  and  not  of \nAppellants.  Furthermore,  even  if the  LAC  did  have  the  powers  granted  to \nVermont's  Joint  Fiscal  Commission,  it  does  not  necessarily  follow  that  a \ndelegation from  the full  legislature to  a narrow sub-group of legislators is  free \nfrom  constitutional  question.  See  generally  Immigration  and  Naturalization \nService v.  Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 103 S. Ct. 2764 (1983) (holding one-house veto \nunconstitutional). \nFinally, amici assert that the unallotment statute penn its the prevention or \noverride  of the  governor's  unallotment  decisions.  See  Brief of Amici  Law \nProfessors  at  17.  This  is  only  a half-truth.  While the legislature can and  has \nexempted  funds  from  unallotment,  there  was  no  reason  to  believe  that  the \ngovernor would attempt to assert this power on such an unprecedented scale or in \nsuch an unprecedented manner. \nIn the seventy-plus years since the unallotment statute was first passed, the \npower  to  unallot  has  been  exercised  by  only  three  governors  in  four  prior \ninstances.  See  generally  PETER  S.  W AT ISON,  SENATE  COUNSEL,  LEGISLATIVE \n20 \n\nHISTORY  OF  UN ALLOTMENT  POWER,  4-13  (June  29,  2009).  In  all  of these \ninstances,  the  unallotments  were  undertaken  towards  the  end  of the  fiscal \nbiennium in the face  of shortfalls that were not effectively addressed during the \ncourse of that biennium.  Id.  Never before have  unallotments been announced \nbefore the start of a fiscal biennium. nor made at the first available opportunity in \nthat biennium, nor made on the scale of the  2009 unallotments, which are ten \ntimes greater than any previous unallotment in Minnesota history. \nThat the power to uoallot was not used until more than forty years after the \noriginal statute was passed - and  then only  four prior times  on a much smaller \nscale - should  be  construed  as  a  party  admission  that  the  power  asserted  by \nAppellants  in  this case was  never  intended when  the  statute  was passed.  The \nlegislature therefore cannot be faulted for failing to anticipate it.  Furthermore, the \nlegislature cannot call itself back into session, so if unallotments are undertaken \nwhen the legislature is not in session, it has no opportunity whatsoever to assert its \nwill  and prevent immediate cuts.  It is doubtful that the  legislature  intended to \nconvey the power to thwart its basic constitutional powers, including completely \nuntethering the governor's power from the override provisions of the presentment \nclause. \nCONCLUSION \nMinnesota's unallotment statute, in its current form, is impermissibly vague \nand unconstitutionally treads on the power of the legislature to detennine when -\nand  upon whom - a duly  allotted appropriation may be reduced or eliminated. \n21 \n\nWithout more specific guidance and limitations, a governor is left with near total \nauthority to determine on whim or caprice whether, when, why, and how any duly \nenacted legislative appropriation is actually put into practice.  Left unchecked by \nthe Court, this claimed power by the governor threatens to undennine the system \nof  checks  and  balances  which  lies  at  the  heart  of  our  state  and  federal \nconstitutions. \nDated:  February 23, 2010  Respectfully submitted, \nLAW OFFICES OF MARTIN A.

The district \ncourt acknowledged that section 16A. 152 is constitutional, but ruled that the unallotment violates separation of \npowers because it does not comply with the statute due to the timing of the unallotment.

V, XI \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n \nThis appeal concerns the validity of the executive branch's reduction of the unexpended allotments of the appropria-\ntions available to fund payments under the Minnesota Supplemental Aid-Special Diet (“MSA-SD”) program in the \ncurrent biennium of July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2011. Under the unallotment statute, Minn. Stat. § 16A.152 (2008), the \nexecutive branch reduced funding for the MSA-SD program effective November 1, 2009, by $2.133 million for fiscal \nyear 2010 and $3.2 million for fiscal year 2011. This was part of a larger set of approximately $2.5 billion in unal-\nlotments of expenditures made by the executive branch under section 16A.152 to address the State's current biennial \nbudget crisis. The Commissioner also took various administrative actions to reduce the budget deficit by about an \nadditional $200 million. See Appellants' Appendix (“A”) at A67-A 111. \n \nRespondents are six Minnesota residents who qualify for payments under the MSA-SD program. They filed this \nlawsuit on November 3, 2009, in Ramsey County District Court against Appellants, who are the Governor of the State \nof Minnesota and the Commissioners of the Minnesota Departments of Management and Budget, Human Services, \nand Revenue. \n \nRespondents claim that the unallotment of funding for the MSA-SD program does not comply with the unallotment \nstatute. A21-A22. Alternatively, Respondents contend that if the statute authorizes the unallotment, then the unal-\nlotment violates separation of powers under the Minnesota Constitution due to its timing. A22-A23; Transcript at 18, \n45. Respondents admit that the unallotment statute is constitutional. Transcript at 11, 45. Respondents' amended \ncomplaint also challenges the validity of the unallotment that reduces funding for renters' property tax refunds in FY \n2011, the second year of the biennium. A22. \n \nOn November 6, 2009, Respondents filed a motion for a temporary restraining order to require Appellants to restore \nthe unallotted funding for the MSA-SD program. A28. On November 12, 2009, Appellants filed a motion to dismiss \nthe amended complaint. A30. They argued that the challenged unallotments are authorized by section 16A.152 and do \nnot violate separation of powers. \n \nAfter extensive briefing by the parties, Respondents' motion was heard by the district court, Chief Judge Kathleen R. \nGearin, on November 16, 2009. That same day, a committee of the House of Representatives voted 14-8 to authorize \nsubmission of an amicus brief in support of Respondents. A letter in opposition to the filing of the amicus brief was \nsubmitted by a member of the House committee on November 16, 2009. With the district court's permission, the \namicus brief was filed on November 20, 2009. \n \nThe district court granted Respondents' motion in an order filed on December 30, 2009. Appellants' Addendum \n(“Add.”) at 7-17.[FN1] The order was based solely on the court's legal conclusion that the unallotment of funding for the \nMSA-SD program does not comport with section 16A.152 and therefore violates separation of powers. Id. The court's \nreasoning calls into question the validity of all of the $2.5 billion in unallotments made to address this biennium's \nbudget crisis. Id. In addition, as the court noted, the November 2009 Economic Forecast mandated by Minn. Stat. § \n16A.103 (2008) projects a further deficit of about $1.2 billion this biennium, beyond the approximate $2.7 billion \ndeficit already addressed by the Commissioner. Add. 14; A142-A150. \n \nFN1. The district court issued an amended order the same day which changed a reference in the initial order \nto the fiscal years for the current biennium. Add. 18. The current biennium in fact covers fiscal years 2010 \nand 2011. \n \nThe district court recognized that the unallotment statute is constitutional, but ruled that the unallotment of funding for \n\n2010 WL 545162 (Minn.)   Page 7 \nthe MSA-SD program does not comply with section 16A.152 because of its timing. Add. 10-12. Without applying or \nanalyzing the specific language of section 16A.152, the court reasoned that the executive branch exceeds its authority \nunder section 16A.152 if it unallots funding to eliminate a deficit that was known at the time the appropriation bills for \nthe biennium were signed into law. Id. The court suggested that in light of the November 2009 Economic Forecast, the \nconditions for unallotment in this biennium exist now, at least with respect to the projected additional deficit of about \n$1.2 billion. Id. at 14. \n \nBased on the order granting Respondents' motion, the parties stipulated to the denial of Appellants' motion to dismiss, \nand entry of final judgment for Respondents under Minn. R. Civ. P. 54.02, on the claim that the unallotment of funding \nfor the MSA-SD program is unlawful. Add. 19-24. The judgment, entered on January 8, 2010, requires Appellants to \nimmediately restore the funding with respect to that unallotment. Id. at 23-24. \n \nAppellants' notice of appeal from the judgment was filed on January 12, 2010. A33. By order filed on January 19, 2010, \nthe Court granted Appellants' petition for accelerated review and their motion for expedited review. Oral argument in \nthe case has been set for March 15, 2010. \n \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n \nThe district court's decision is based on the public records regarding the unallotments and the court's analysis of the \nlaw. The relevant facts are not in dispute. \n \nA. State Revenue And Expenditure Forecasts. \n \nThe Commissioner of Minnesota Management and Budget (“MMB”), Tom Hanson (“Commissioner”), is required to \n“manage the state's financial affairs.” Minn. Stat. § 16A.055, subd. l(a)(2) (2008). As part of this responsibility, in \nFebruary and November of each year, the Commissioner must prepare “a forecast of state revenue and expenditures.” \nMinn. Stat. § 16A.103, subd. 1 (2008). \n \nIn preparing the forecast, “[r]evenue must be estimated for all sources provided for in current law.” Id., subd. la. The \nforecast must take into account economic information available at the time of the forecast. Id., subd. 1 e. A forecast \nprepared in the first year of a biennium must cover the current and subsequent biennium. A forecast prepared in the \nsecond year of the biennium covers the current and next two bienniums. Id., subd. Ig. The Commissioner's forecast is \ndelivered to both the Legislature and the Governor. Id., subd. 1. Between forecasts MMB releases monthly reports \ndocumenting monthly revenue collections which compare actual receipts to forecast projections. See A120-A121. \n \n*6 B. The 2009 Legislative Session. \n \nBetween May 4 and May 21, 2009, the Legislature passed and presented to the Governor the appropriation bills for the \n2010-11 biennium, which were signed by the Governor on May 7, 14-16, and 21-22, 2009. See Minnesota Session \nLaws 2009, chs. 36, 37, 78, 79, 83, 93-96, 101, 126, 143, 172. On May 8, 2009, the Legislature passed a bill that \nincreased taxes from existing tax laws. House File 885 (chapter 77). The Governor vetoed the bill on May 9, 2009. A \nvote by the Legislature on May 17, 2009 to override the veto was unsuccessful. Journal of the House 6563-64 (2009). \nThe 2009 legislative session concluded on May 18, 2009, and at that time a huge budget deficit existed. Add. 5; A67. \n \nC. Unallotments By The Executive Branch For The 2010-2011 Biennium. \n \nBecause Article XI of the Minnesota Constitution limits the manner in which public debt may be used to fund State \ngovernment, the State must maintain a balanced budget for each biennium. Minn. Const. art. XI, § 6. In 1939, to ensure \nthat the State's budget remains balanced during a biennium, the Legislature enacted a so-called “unallotment” statute \nauthorizing the executive branch to reduce State spending to correct a biennial budget shortfall. Minnesota Session \n\n2010 WL 545162 (Minn.)   Page 8 \nLaws 1939, ch. 431, art. 2, § 16.[FN2] The Legislature has amended the law through the years. See, e.g., Minnesota \nSession Laws 1987, ch. 268, art. 18, §§ 1-3; Add. 4. \n \nFN2. The allotment and encumbrance system does not apply to the legislative and judicial branches. See \nMinn. Stat. § 16.14, subd. 2a (2008). \n \n*7 The current version of the unallotment law is found in Minn. Stat. § 16A.152 (2008 & Supp. 2009), which is en-\ntitled “Budget Reserve and Cash Flow Accounts.” Add. 1-4. Subdivisions 1 and 1(a) of section 16A.152 establish a \n“cash flow account” and “budget reserve” to manage the state's cash flow needs and provide for a so-called “rainy day \nfund.” Subdivision 2 of section 16A.152 provides that “if on the basis of a forecast of general fund revenues and \nexpenditures” the Commissioner determines that a surplus will exist for the biennium, the Commissioner must allo-\ncate money to the cash flow and budget reserve accounts and for other specified purposes depending upon the amount \nof the surplus. Subdivision 3 states, in part, that “[t]he budget reserve may be used when a negative budgetary balance \nis projected ....” \n \nSubdivision 4 of section 16A. 152, entitled “Reduction,” then states in relevant part as follows: \n(a) If the commissioner [of MMB] determines that probable receipts for the general fund will be less than anticipated, \nand that the amount available for the remainder of the biennium will be less than needed, the commissioner shall, with \nthe approval of the governor, and after consulting the Legislative Advisory Commission, reduce the amount in the \nbudget reserve account as needed to balance expenditures with revenue. \n(b) An additional deficit shall, with the approval of the governor, and after consulting the legislative advisory com-\nmission, be made up by reducing unexpended allotments of any prior appropriation or transfer. Notwithstanding any \nother law to the contrary, the commissioner is empowered to defer or suspend prior statutorily created obligations \nwhich would prevent effecting such reductions. \n \n(Emphasis added); see also Minn. Stat. § 16A.011, subd. 4 (2008) (defining “appropriation” as “an authorization by \nlaw to expend or encumber an amount in the treasury”); id., subd. 3 (defining “allotment” as “a limit placed by the \ncommissioner [of *8 MMB] on the amount to be spent or encumbered during a period of time pursuant to an appro-\npriation”).[FN3] \n \nFN3. Statutory references to the Commissioner of Finance are now to the Commissioner of Minnesota \nManagement and Budget, the agency into which Finance was merged. See Minnesota Session Laws 2009, ch. \n101, art. 2, § 109. \n \nPursuant to section 16A.152, subdivision 4(a), the Commissioner determined on June 4, 2009 in a letter to the Gov-\nernor and the Legislature that probable general fund receipts for the 2010-2011 biennium would be less than antic-\nipated in the Commissioner's February 2009 forecast and that the amount available for the biennium would be less \nthan needed to balance expenditures with revenues. Add. 5; A67. The Commissioner also noted that the budget reserve \naccount had previously been drawn down to zero and that an approximate $2.7 billion deficit remained in the general \nfund for the 2010-2011 biennium based on the February forecast (after adjustments enacted by the Legislature). Id. \n \nThe Commissioner therefore concluded that the budget deficit for the biennium will be greater than $2.7 billion be-\ncause revenue will be significantly less than projected in his February forecast. Id. The Commissioner decided to \nunallot $2.5 billion, and take administrative action saving $200 million, and await his November 2009 forecast and/or \npossible legislative action during the 2010 session before making additional unallotments. Id.; A139-A140. \n \nThe Commissioner's proposed unallotments to eliminate approximately $2.5 billion in expenditures were approved by \nthe Governor on July 1, 2009, after consultation *9 with the Legislative Advisory Commission (“LAC”), which in-\ncluded two formal public meetings of the LAC attended by the Commissioner and other executive branch officials.[FN4] \nA69-A98, A 102. The unallotments were implemented beginning in July 2009. A92-A 111. The Commissioner also \n\n2010 WL 545162 (Minn.)   Page 9 \nnotified the legislative budget committees of the approved unallotments within fifteen days, as required by subdivision \n6 of section 16A. 152. A99-A111. \n \nFN4. The LAC consists of legislative leaders, including the majority leader of the Senate and the speaker of \nthe House. Minn. Stat. § 3.30, subd. 2 (2008). \n \nThe Commissioner's determination that “probable receipts for the general fund will be less than anticipated” was \nbased on MMB's evaluation of compelling evidence of a worsening economy and decreasing revenue collections. Add. \n5; A67. As the Commissioner concluded, this information established that receipts for the 2010-2011 biennium would \nbe less than projected in his February 2009 Economic Forecast, which in turn had been significantly lower than the \nNovember 2008 forecast. Id. Subsequent analyses by MMB in the summer and fall of 2009 showed significant con-\ntinuing reductions in the State's revenues from previously anticipated levels reflected in the February 2009 forecast. \nA38-A66, A112-A121. On November 10, 2009, MMB determined that actual receipts for the first four months of the \n2010-2011 biennium were already $81.4 million less than projected. A120-A121. \n \nThe Commissioner's November 2009 Economic Forecast, issued on December 2, 2009, projected that general fund \nrevenues will be $1.156 billion lower than the February 2009 forecast. A142-A150. The November 2009 forecast \nprojected an additional budget *10 deficit of about $1.2 billion this biennium, beyond the approximate $2.7 billion \ndeficit already addressed by the Commissioner's unallotments and administrative actions. Id. \n \nMany of the $2.5 billion of unallotments approved in July 2009 take effect in the second year of the biennium, which \nbegins July 1, 2010. A92-A98. This delay provides more time to prepare for the spending reductions and their im-\nplementation. It also permits time for the Minnesota Legislature to address the reductions, if it chooses, during the \n2010 legislative session. However, the longer it takes to implement the necessary spending corrections, the more \ndifficult it will be to balance the budget during the biennium. At this time, approximately 30% of the biennium has \nalready elapsed. The largest unallotment is a $1.77 billion deferral in payments to school districts, $702 million of \nwhich is scheduled for the 2011 fiscal year. A92. \n \nD. Unallotment Of Funding For The MSA-SD Program. \n \nThe  unallotments  approved  in  July  2009 i nclude  funding  for  the  Minnesota  Supplemental  Aid-Special  Diet \n(“MSA-SD”) program. A95. MSA-SD is part of the broader Minnesota Supplemental Aid (“MSA”) program. The \nMSA program, which is supervised by the Department of Human Services (“DHS”) and administered by counties, \nprovides for State-funded monthly cash payments to supplement federal Supplemental Security Income benefits for \ncertain individuals. See Minn. Stat. §§ 256D.33-256D.54 (2008). MSA-SD provides for special needs payments to \nqualified MSA participants for certain medically prescribed diets. Id., § 256D.44, subd. 5(a). \n \nMSA-SD is not funded by a separate appropriation specific to that program, but rather as part of a general appropri-\nation to DHS for all the various MSA grants. *11 Minnesota Session Laws 2009, ch. 79 (House File 1362), art. 13, § 3, \nsubd. 4(j) (A127). \n \nIn the current biennium, the general appropriation to DHS for all MSA grants is $33.93 million for FY 2010 and \n$35.191 million for FY 2011. Id. In July 2009, the Commissioner reduced the allotment of the FY2010 DHS appro-\npriation for MSA grants by $2.866 million, and the allotment of the FY 2011 DHS appropriation for MSA grants by \n$4.3 million, or approximately 8% and 12.2% of total MSA funding for FY 2010 and 2011, respectively. A100. These \nunallotments represent a reduction in MSA-SD funding of $2.133 million for FY 2010 and $3.2 million for FY 2011. \nA95. The effect of the unallotments was to eliminate funding for MSA-SD payments for the period of November 1, \n2009 through June 30, 2011. Id. \n \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \n\n2010 WL 545162 (Minn.)   Page 10 \n \nStatutory and constitutional interpretation present questions of law, which the Court reviews de novo. State ex rel. \nHumphrey v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., 713 N.W.2d 350, 355 (Minn. 2006), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1206 (2007). \n \nARGUMENT \n \nI. THE UNALLOTMENT OF FUNDING FOR THE MSA-SD PROGRAM IS AUTHORIZED BY MINN. STAT. § \n16A.152. \n \nApplication of the plain language of the statute, and longstanding principles of construction if the statute is considered \nambiguous, establishes that the challenged unallotment is authorized by section 16A. 152. \n \n*12 A. The Plain Language Of The Statute Controls. \n \nIt is settled law that the plain language of the statute controls and “shall not be disregarded under the pretext of pur-\nsuing the spirit [of the statute].” Minn. Stat. § 645.16 (2008); see also American Tower, L.P. v. City of Grant, 636 \nN.W.2d 309, 312 (Minn. 2001) (stating that in applying statute's plain language, “statutory construction is neither \nnecessary nor permitted”). Indeed, the plain language of a statute controls whether or not the reviewing court considers \nthe result to be “reasonable” or “good policy.” Hyatt v. Anoka Police Dep ‘t, 691 N.W.2d 824, 826-28 (Minn. 2005). \n \n1. The Commissioner's Unallotments Comply With The Plain Language Of Section 16A.152. \n \nUnder the plain language of section 16A.152, subdivision 4(a), the unallotment authority may be exercised if the \nMMB Commissioner “determines that probable receipts for the general fund will be less than anticipated, and that the \namount available for the remainder of the biennium will be less than needed.” Once the Commissioner makes this \ndetermination, the statute empowers him, with the approval of the Governor and after consulting with the LAC, to \neliminate a deficit in the general fund by first exhausting the amount in the budget reserve account and then elimi-\nnating any remaining deficit “by reducing unexpended allotments of any prior appropriation or transfer.” Id., subds. \n4(a)-(b). \n \nThe public records confirm that each of the conditions of section 16A.152 was satisfied with respect to the unallot-\nments made for this biennium. The Commissioner reported to the Governor and the Legislature in his June 4, 2009 \nletter that he had *13 “determined, as defined in Minnesota Statutes 16A.152, that ‘probable receipts for the general \nfund will be less than anticipated, and that the amount available for the remainder of the [2010-2011] biennium will be \nless than needed.’ ” Add. 5; A67. The budget reserve account was previously drawn down to zero. Id. The Commis-\nsioner's proposed unallotments were approved by the Governor in July 2009, after the Commissioner's consultation \nwith the LAC. A69-A91. The Commissioner then notified the legislative budget committees of the approved unal-\nlotments within fifteen days as required by section 16A.152, subdivision 6. A99-A111. As to the MSA-SD program, \nthere was an unexpended FY2010 allotment and an unexpended FY2011 allotment of the appropriation from which \nthe program was to be funded this biennium. A95, A100, A128; Minn. Stat. § 16A.011, subds. 3-4. \n \nThe Commissioner explained in his June 4, 2009 letter to the Governor and the Legislature that “probable receipts for \nthe general fund will be less than anticipated” because compelling evidence of a worsening economy and decreasing \nrevenue collections showed that receipts for the 2010-2011 biennium would be less than projected in the Commis-\nsioner's February 2009 Economic Forecast (as well as the November 2008 Economic Forecast). Add. 5; A67. The \nCommissioner's determination that “the amount available for the remainder of the [2010-2011] biennium will be less \nthan needed” was based on the obvious deficiency between authorized spending and revenues provided for under \nexisting law. Id. \n \nThe Commissioner's use of the February 2009 forecast as the reference point for “anticipated” revenue is consistent \n\n2010 WL 545162 (Minn.)   Page 11 \nwith the literal language of the statute. Minnesota law *14 mandates that the Commissioner prepare these forecasts, \nMinn. Stat. § 16A.103, and the forecasts are explicitly referenced in section 16A.152. Minn. Stat. § 16A.152, subd. \n2(a)-(b). As part of the forecasts the Commissioner must project anticipated revenue for the biennium. Minn. Stat. § \n16A.103, subd. la. Considering the importance of these forecasts and the context of section 16A.152, the Commis-\nsioner's forecasts are certainly an appropriate benchmark for “anticipated” receipts when he determines whether \n“probable receipts for the general fund will be less than anticipated.” Moreover, the plain language of the statute does \nnot preclude the Commissioner from using his forecasts as a benchmark for “anticipated” revenue. \n \nThe accuracy of the Commissioner's June 2009 determination that probable receipts for the 2010-2011 biennium \nwould be less than anticipated in his February 2009 Economic Forecast has been borne out by subsequent reports of \nactual receipts. As MMB reported on November 10, 2009, actual receipts for the first four months of the biennium \nwere already $81.4 million less than the forecasted amount. A120-A121. The November 2009 Economic Forecast \nprojected an approximate $1.15 billion decrease in revenue from the February 2009 forecast and an additional budget \ndeficit of about $1.2 billion this biennium. A142-A150. \n \nUnder the plain language of section 16A.152, each of the conditions for unallotment was met, including a determi-\nnation that probable receipts for the biennium *15 would be less than anticipated and a budget deficit exists. The \nunallotments are therefore authorized by the statute.[FN5] \n \nFN5. The Commissioner also properly decided to unallot and take administrative action to address the $2.7 \nbillion deficit reflected in his February 2009 forecast (after adjustments enacted by the Legislature) and defer \nfurther unallotments until he issued his November 2009 forecast and/or until possible legislative action at the \n2010 legislative session. A67-Alll; A139-A140. Once the Commissioner determined the predicate facts \nunder section 16A. 152, subdivision 4(a), necessary to invoke the unallotment statute, he then had discretion \nto determine how best to effect the unallotments. See Rukavina v. Pawlenty, 684 N.W.2d 525, 533-35 (Minn. \nCt. App. 2004), rev. denied (Minn. Oct. 19, 2004). As stated in Miller v. Foley, 317 N.W.2d 710, 714 (Minn. \n1982), which involved budget reduction decisions of the government: \nWhen considering decisions of a governmental unit involving judgment and discretion, the court will not \nsubstitute its judgment for that of the governmental unit.... If the reasonableness of the action of the go-\nvernmental unit is “at least doubtful, or fairly debatable,” the court will uphold the action. \n \n(Emphasis added; citations omitted.) The Commissioner's November 2009 forecast quantified the additional \ndeficit in the amount of $1.2 billion. See supra pp. 9-10. \n \n2. The District Court Ignored The Plain Language Of The Statute And The Plain Language Doctrine. \n \nThe district court did not even reference, much less apply, the plain language of subdivision 4(a) or legal principles \napplicable to the interpretation of the plain language of laws. Rather, the district court erroneously concluded that the \nstatute was inapplicable because the State's budget crisis was not “unforeseen,” Add. 12, a term that does not appear, \nand a condition that does not exist, in section 16A.152. \n \nThe district court also concluded that the Commissioner improperly used the unallotment authority because the budget \ncrisis “was neither unknown nor unanticipated when the appropriation bills became law.” Id. The court's analysis \nagain fails to apply the statutory unallotment standards. In so doing, the court erroneously rewrites *16 subdivision \n4(a)'s requirement that the Commissioner determine “probable receipts for the general fund will be less than antic-\nipated” to include a temporal limitation that this determination can be based only on information received after the \nappropriation bills are signed. \n \nAs this Court has repeatedly emphasized, the plain language doctrine does not permit such a limitation to be read into \nthe statute. See, e.g., Reiter v. Kiffmeyer, 721 N.W.2d 908, 911 (Minn. 2006) (reiterating that “we will not read into a \n\n2010 WL 545162 (Minn.)   Page 12 \nstatute a provision that the legislature has omitted, either purposely or inadvertently”); Hutchinson Tech., Inc. v. \nCommissioner of Revenue, 698 N.W.2d 1, 12 (Minn. 2005) (reiterating that “we are unwilling to write into a statute \nwhat the legislature did not”); Green Giant Co. v. Commissioner of Revenue, 534 N.W.2d 710, 712 (Minn. 1995) (“We \nwill not supply that which the legislature purposefully omits or inadvertently overlooks.”). \n \nIn sum, because the plain language of section 16A. 152 establishes that the statute authorizes the Commissioner's \nunallotments, construction of the statute is not necessary nor permitted. State v. Peck, 773 N.W.2d 768, 772 (Minn. \n2009) (“We have consistently refused to assume a legislative intent in plain contradiction to words used by the leg-\nislature.”) (quoting State v. Jesmer, 293 Minn. 442, 443, 196 N.W.2d 924, 924 (1972)). \n \nB. Even Assuming The Statute Is Ambiguous, The Commissioner's Interpretation Is Supported By Established Prin-\nciples Of Statutory Construction. \n \nAs discussed above, the Commissioner's unallotments were based on an application of the unambiguous language of \nthe statute. However, if the Court finds *17 section 16A.152 to be ambiguous with respect to the Commissioner's use \nof the unallotment authority, the Court may construe the statute by considering factors that include the purpose of the \nstatute, the consequences of the competing interpretations, the public interest, and the implementing agency's inter-\npretation. Minn. Stat. § 645.16; Peck, 773 N.W.2d at 772. All of these principles support the Commissioner's unal-\nlotments. \n \n1. The Statute's Purpose Of Avoiding Budget Deficits And Preventing Financial Crises Is Consistent With The \nCommissioner's Interpretation Of The Law. \n \nAn ambiguous statute should be construed to effectuate its purpose. See Minn. Stat. § 645.16(3)-(4); Lee v. Fresenius \nMed. Care, Inc., 741 N.W.2d 117, 123 (Minn. 2007). The Commissioner's interpretation of section 16A. 152 effec-\ntuates the purpose of the law. \n \nSection 16A.152 is intended to prevent budget deficits and avert financial crises. See Rukavina, 684 N.W.2d at 533 \n(“The entire statutory scheme [in Minn. Stat. § 16A.152] is designed to enable the commissioner of finance, with \napproval of the governor and after consultation with the legislative advisory commission, to compensate for deficits in \nthe general fund.”); id. at 535 (stating that section 16A.152 “authorize[s] the executive branch to avoid, or reduce, a \nbudget shortfall in any given biennium” and “enables the executive to protect the state from financial crisis in a \nmanner designated by the legislature”). See also New England Div. of American Cancer Soc'y v. Commissioner of \nAdmin., 769 N.E.2d 1248, 1257 (Mass. 2002) (stating that the Massachusetts unallotment law “reflects a legislative \ndetermination that the Commonwealth's need to *18 remain solvent overrides particular statements of social policy \ncontained in those appropriation items subject to allotment”). The statutory purpose conforms to the constitutional \nmandate that the State's biennial budget be balanced. See supra p. 6. \n \nThe Commissioner initiated the unallotment process to address a large State budget shortfall after concluding in June \n2009 that “the state's revenues are not anticipated to be sufficient to support planned spending in the upcoming bi-\nennium.” Add. 5; A67. The Commissioner's use of the unallotment authority effectuates the statute's purpose, and the \ncorresponding constitutional requirement, by avoiding a huge budget deficit and averting a financial crisis. \n \n2. The Consequence Of The Commissioner's Interpretation, Which Avoids The Potential Shutdown Of State Gov-\nernment, Further Supports The Commissioner's Use Of The Unallotment Statute. \n \nThe consequences of the interpretations at issue in this appeal are also pertinent to the Court's construction of the \nstatute. See Minn. Stat. § 645.16(6); Burkstrand v. Burkstrand, 632 N.W.2d 206, 210 (Minn. 2001). Here, the Com-\nmissioner's interpretation avoids a potential government shutdown, and the opposing interpretation does not. This \nlends further support to the Commissioner's construction of the statute. \n\n2010 WL 545162 (Minn.)   Page 13 \n \nAs the district court recognized, its interpretation of section 16A.152 calls into question the validity of all the unal-\nlotments approved by the Governor in July 2009. Add. 23. Indeed, the district court's interpretation appears to mean \nthe executive branch could not eliminate the $2.7 billion deficit with unallotments even at this point in time, despite \nthe court's apparent acknowledgment that the statutory conditions for unallotment are now present based on the No-\nvember 2009 Economic Forecast. Add. 14-16. Under *19 the district court's view, the $2.7 billion deficit would have \nto be eliminated by agreement of the Legislature and Governor or not at all.[FN6] It is unclear whether the district court \nconcluded that the additional $1.2 billion deficit can be corrected by the Commissioner through unallotment.[FN7] \n \nFN6. See, e.g., Add. 16 (“Their [the executive and legislative branches'] policy differences regarding how to \ndeal with Minnesota's present budget situation can only be resolved by them.”). \n \nFN7. See Add. 14 (referring to $1.2 billion budget deficit reflected in November 2009 forecast and stating \n“[e]ven if the budget had been balanced through painful give and take between the Executive and Legislative \nbranches, the Governor would have had to use his unallotment authority before the end of this biennium”). \n \nThe district court's interpretation of section 16A.152 produces obvious adverse consequences for the operation of \nState government. The Minnesota Constitution does not permit the State's biennial budget to remain in deficit. Minn. \nConst. art. XI, § 6. The Governor and Legislature were previously unable to reach agreement on how to resolve the \n$2.7 billion budget deficit. Under the district court's reasoning, in the absence of such an agreement, spending pur-\nsuant to the biennium's appropriation bills will continue until such time as the State simply runs out of money before \nthe biennium ends, resulting in a government shutdown, at least as to non-core functions. See State ex rel. Sviggum v. \nHanson, 732 N.W.2d 312, 315-17, 324 (Minn. Ct. App. 2007) (rejecting, on procedural grounds, challenge to June \n2005 court order that authorized the finance commissioner to *20 continue to fund “core functions” of the executive \nbranch in the absence of legislative appropriations for them).[FN8] \n \nFN8. The potential outcome of the district court's construction of the statute would be worse than the 2005 \npartial shutdown, when the State had money but no appropriation authorizing its expenditure. A potential \nconsequence of the district court's construction would be to require an additional $2.5 billion in general fund \nexpenditures in the remaining months of the biennium - at a time when a $1.2 billion deficit exists that must \nbe closed by the end of the biennium, on June 30, 2011. The district court's construction would mean that the \nState could be without money to even pay for core function expenditures ordered by a court. \n \nIn contrast, the Commissioner's interpretation of section 16A.152 allows an alternative mechanism to resolve the \ndeficit in the State's general fund and avoid a government shutdown. Thus, Appellants submit that the consequence of \nthe competing interpretations before the Court, i.e., the ability of State government to operate, weighs in favor of the \nCommissioner's interpretation of section 16A. 152. \n \n3. The Public Interest In Continuing The Operation Of State Government Also Lends Credence To The Commis-\nsioner's Application Of The Unallotment Statute. \n \nThe Court must also consider the public interest in construing section 16A.152. See Mower County Bd. of Comm ‘rs v. \nBoard of Trustees of Pub. Employees Ret. Ass'n, 271 Minn. 505, 512, 136 N.W.2d 671, 676 (1965) (stating that “the \npublic interest is involved in every case before us and in every judicial or administrative construction of statutes”); \nKelly v. First Minneapolis Trust Co., 178 Minn. 215, 218, 226 N.W. 696, 697 (1929) (“Where the proper construction \nof a statute is otherwise doubtful, arguments from possible injustice or prejudice to the public interests or common \nrights may be considered.”). \n \n*21 The public interest is implicated by competing public policies relating to the interaction between the executive \nbranch and Legislature to implement a balanced budget. On the one hand, the Governor and Legislature attempt to \n\n2010 WL 545162 (Minn.)   Page 14 \nagree on a balanced budget at the outset of the biennium. On the other hand, section 16A.152 has been enacted to allow \nthe executive branch to remedy a budget shortfall through unallotment to avoid a financial crisis for the State and its \ncitizens. See supra pp. 17-18. \n \nIn this instance, the Governor and Legislature have been unable to reach an agreement on how to balance the State's \nbudget. Our system of democracy relies on periodic elections for the voters to express their approval or disapproval of \ntheir elected officials' public policy determinations. The current budget crisis and impasse may certainly be a subject \nof consideration by the voters. \n \nIn the meantime, it is in the public interest for the State to continue to operate for the benefit of its citizens. The statute \nserves as a method to continue the operation of State government if the predicate conditions of section 16A.152, \nsubdivision 4(a), are satisfied. In this regard, the executive and legislative branches are in a position to control whether \nthe predicate condition of a budget deficit exists, id., based on when, and if, they pass and sign (or veto) appropriation \nbills. No biennial budget deficit can exist unless the appropriation bills are enacted authorizing the State to spend \nmoney. \n \n4. Courts Defer To A Commissioner's Interpretation Of A Statute That The Commissioner Administers. \n \nThe office of the Commissioner of Finance (now MMB) has administered the unallotment statute in its various ite-\nrations for almost forty years. See Legislative History *22 of Unallotment Power, at 4-13 (Senate Counsel, June 29, \n2009) available at www.senate.leg.state.mn.us/departments/scr/treatise. A Commissioner's interpretation of a statute \nhe administers is entitled to deference. See, e.g., Krumm v. R.A. Nadeau Co., 276 N.W.2d 641, 644 (Minn. 1979) \n(stating established principle that “[w]hen the meaning of a statute is doubtful, courts should give great weight to a \nconstruction placed upon it by the department charged with its administration”). This judicial deference is “rooted in \nthe separation of powers doctrine.” In re Excess Surplus Status of Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Minnesota, 624 N.W.2d \n264, 278 (Minn. 2001) (footnote omitted). In according the required deference, “an agency's interpretation of the \nstatutes it administers ... should be upheld, absent a finding that it is in conflict with the express purpose of the Act and \nthe intention of the legislature.” Geo. A. Hormel & Co. v. Asper, 428 N.W.2d 47, 50 (Minn. 1988). Because no such \nconflict exists here, caselaw provides that the Court should defer to the Commissioner's interpretation of the statute. \n \nIf section 16A.152 is deemed ambiguous, established principles of construction lead to the same conclusion as ap-\nplication of the statute's plain language, thereby authorizing the Commissioner's use of the statute. \n \nII. THE UNALLOTMENT OF FUNDING FOR THE MSA-SD PROGRAM DOES NOT VIOLATE SEPARATION \nOF POWERS UNDER THE MINNESOTA CONSTITUTION. \n \nThe district court recognized that the unallotment statute is constitutional. Add. 10. However, the court erroneously \nconcluded, due to the timing of the challenged unallotment, that section 16A.152 does not apply and therefore the \nunallotment violates separation of powers. Add. 10-12. As discussed above, the Commissioner's *23 unallotments \ncomply with section 16A.152, see supra pp. 11-22, and accordingly do not violate separation of powers. \n \nRespondents admit that the statute is constitutional, but contend that the timing of the challenged unallotment, even if \nit complies with the statute, violates separation of powers.[FN9] This argument is without merit because regardless of its \ntiming, the unallotment by the executive branch does not involve the exercise of purely legislative power. \n \nFN9. See, e.g., A22-A23; Transcript at 45 (Respondents' counsel clarifying at November 16, 2009 hearing \nbefore district court,”[i]t is not that the statute is unconstitutional, it's that the Defendants' use of it at this time \nis unconstitutional”). \n \nA. A Constitutional Violation Is Found Only With Extreme Caution And Legislative Delegations Are Liberally \n\n2010 WL 545162 (Minn.)   Page 15 \nPermitted To Facilitate The Administration Of State Laws. \n \nConstitutional violations will be found by a court “with extreme caution and only when absolutely necessary.” State v. \nTennin, 674N.W.2d 403, 407 (Minn. 2004) (quoting State v. Larsen, 650 N.W.2d 144, 147 (Minn. 2002)). That is \nparticularly true in this case because the Court has “chosen to view legislative delegations liberally in order to faci-\nlitate the administration of laws which ... are complex in their application.” State v. King, 257 N.W.2d 693, 697 (Minn. \n1977).[FN10] Indeed, the Court has taken a very practical approach to determine whether separation of powers is vi-\nolated. As stated in *24 Anderson v. Commissioner of Highways, 267 Minn. 308, 311-12, 126 N.W.2d 778, 780-781 \n(1964): \n \nFN10. Over the last sixty years, since the seminal legislative delegation case of Lee v. Delmont, 228 Minn. \n101, 36 N.W.2d 530 (1949) was decided, the Court has found only one instance of legislative delegation \nwhich violated separation of powers. That case has no bearing here. Remington Arms Co., Inc. v. G.E.M. of St. \nLouis, Inc., 257 Minn. 562, 102 N.W.2d 528 (1960) (invalidating statutory provision that delegated legisla-\ntive powers to private parties). \n \nThe modem tendency is to be more liberal in permitting grants of discretion to administrative officers in order to \nfacilitate the administration of laws as the complexity of economic and governmental conditions increase.... [I]t is \nimpossible for the legislature to deal directly with the many details in the varied and complex conditions on which it \nlegislates, but must necessarily leave them to the reasonable discretion of administrative officers. \n \n(Emphasis added; footnotes omitted.) \n \nB. Unallotment Does Not Constitute The Exercise Of Purely Legislative Power By The Executive Branch. \n \nIn addressing the separation of powers doctrine, this Court has emphasized that “there has never been an absolute \ndivision of governmental functions in this country, nor was such even intended.” Wulff v. Tax Court of Appeals, 288 \nN.W.2d 221, 223 (Minn. 1979) (footnote omitted). “[S]ome functions of one branch may be performed by another \nbranch without subverting the Constitution. That there is some interference between the branches does not undermine \nthe separation of powers; rather, it gives vitality to the concept of checks and balances critical to our notion of de-\nmocracy.” Id. See also New England Div. of American Cancer Soc'y v. Commissioner of Admin. (“New England'), 769 \nN.E.2d 1248, 1256 (Mass. 2002) (stating “we speak in abstract terms of separation of powers; in reality, some overlap \nis inevitable, and may well be desirable”). \n \nSeparation of powers is violated if the Legislature “delegate[s] purely legislative power” to the executive branch. Lee \nv. Delmont, 228 Minn. at 112, 36 N.W.2d at 538. The Court reasoned in Lee v. Delmont that “[i]t does not follow, \nbecause a power may be wielded by the legislature directly, or because it entails an exercise of discretion and *25 \njudgment, that it is exclusively legislative.” Id. at 113, 36 N.W.2d at 538. Rather, purely legislative power “is the \nauthority to make a complete law - complete as to the time it shall take effect and as to whom it shall apply - and to \ndetermine the expediency of its enactment.” Id. The Minnesota Constitution gives the Legislature the power to make \nappropriation laws. Minn. Const. art. XI, § 1 (“No money shall be paid out of the treasury of this state except in \npursuance of an appropriation by law.”). \n \nThe spending power, however, belongs to the executive branch. See Minn. Const. art V, § 3 (providing Governor the \nresponsibility and duty to execute the laws); see also Opinion of the Justices, 376 N.E.2d 1217, 1222 (Mass. 1978) \n(observing that “spending money is essentially an executive task” and thus “it is the function of the executive branch \nto expend funds”). In the New England case, the Massachusetts Supreme Court rejected a separation of powers \nchallenge to the Massachusetts unallotment statute. In so doing, it reasoned as follows: \nTwo key concepts are determinative of our analysis: (1) a statute may not constitutionally allow the Governor to \nexercise the appropriation power; but (2) a statute may grant the Governor discretion to determine how to spend \n\n2010 WL 545162 (Minn.)   Page 16 \nappropriated funds, or, in limited circumstances, to withhold their expenditure. Thus, “[a] distinction must be made \nbetween the power of the Legislature to control the expenditure of funds in the sense that it determines the purposes for \nwhich expenditures may be made, and the power to control the extent of expenditures committed to a particular \npurpose.” We conclude that [the Massachusetts unallotment law] is an example of the latter power and constitutes, not \nthe legislative power of appropriation, but rather the executive power of expenditure. \n \n769 N.E.2d at 1256 (emphasis added; citations and footnote omitted). \n \nThe New England court further stated: \n*26 [The unallotment law] confers on the Governor neither the authority to set aside money from the treasury to be \nspent for a particular purpose, nor the authority to direct that any money so appropriated be spent in a manner dif-\nferent from what the Legislature intended. Instead, [the unallotment law] permits the Governor to use her executive \njudgment to reduce public expenditures in a time of true financial emergency. This obligation conforms to the con-\nstitutional requirement for a balanced budget. It reflects a legislative determination that the Commonwealth's need to \nremain solvent overrides particular statements of social policy contained in those appropriation items subject to \nallotment.... \n \nId. at 1257 (emphasis added; citations omitted). The court in New England also discussed the practical aspect of the \nuse of the unallotment law: \n[T]he Governor can reduce only the allotment; the underlying appropriation remains fully in force to establish an \nupper limit on what may be spent for that line item, should sufficient revenue be forthcoming. It should not be over-\nlooked either that [the unallotment law] requires that the Legislature be put on notice when a projected budget deficit \ntriggers the statute's operation. To the extent that the Legislature chooses, it retains full authority to restore funding to \nprograms affected by ... allotment reductions ... by enacting legislation ... to make up for any budget deficiency. \nFurther, the Legislature may pass “conditions” to items in an appropriation bill, exempting the funds in question from \nallotment reductions... \n \nId. (emphasis added). \n \nRelying on Lee v. Delmont, the Court of Appeals similarly recognized in Rukavina that Minn. Stat. § 16A.152 does not \ndelegate the purely legislative power of making an appropriation law. Rukavina, 684 N.W.2d at 535 (concluding that \nthe statute “does not represent a legislative delegation of the legislature's ultimate authority to appropriate money,” \nand “only enables the executive to protect the state from financial crisis in a manner designated by the legislature”); \nsee also Minnesota Fed'n of Teachers v. Quie, No. 447358, at 4 (Second Jud. Dist. Feb. 27, 1981) (upholding con-\nstitutionality of prior *27 version of the statute and stating “[t]his Court can find no basis for the claim of the plaintiffs \nthat the statute in question constitutes an unlawful delegation from the legislature to the executive branch”) (A137). \nThe district court itself referred to the Rukavina decision in acknowledging that section 16A. 152 is constitutional. \nAdd. 10. \n \nThe statute gives the Commissioner power to reduce the allotment for an appropriation to avoid a budget shortfall. An \n“allotment” as defined by the Legislature is “a limit placed by the commissioner [of MMB] on the amount to be spent \nor encumbered during a period of time pursuant to an appropriation.” Minn. Stat. § 16A.011, subd. 3 (emphasis \nadded). Section 16A.152 simply authorizes the executive branch to reduce spending in accordance with the statute if \ncertain predicate facts are determined by the Commissioner. See, e.g., Rukavina, 684 N.W.2d at 535. As stated by this \nCourt in Lee v. Delmont, “[t]he power to ascertain facts, which automatically brings a law into operation by virtue of \nits own terms, is not the power to pass, modify, or annul a law.” 228 Minn. at 113, 36 N.W.2d at 538; see also King, \n257 N.W.2d at 697 (“While the legislature may not delegate the authority to make a complete law, it may constitu-\ntionally authorize an administrative body to determine those facts that will make a statute effective.”). \n \nOther state court decisions, in addition to New England, have also held that their state's unallotment laws do not \n\n2010 WL 545162 (Minn.)   Page 17 \ndelegate the legislative power of appropriation. See, e.g., University of Connecticut Chapter AAUP v. Governor, 512 \nA.2d 152, 158 (Conn. 1986) (stating that the Connecticut unallotment law “does not delegate the legislative authority \nto appropriate,” but rather “delegates to the governor the power” to reduce “allotments”); North Dakota Council of Sch. \nAdm ‘rs v. Sinner, 458 N.W.2d 280, 286 (N.D. 1990) (“The *28 Legislature has not given the director of the budget \npower to make a law, but only the authority to execute the law within the parameters established by the Legislature.”); \nHunter v. State, 865 A.2d 381, 392 (Vt. 2004) (recognizing that “appropriation is a legislative power, but spending is \nan executive power” and the Vermont unallotment statute “involves shared powers at the intersection of the branches \nof government”). See also Colorado General Assembly v. Lamm, 700 P.2d 508, 520 (Colo. 1985) (noting that the \ngovernor's “duty to execute appropriations or spending laws encompasses the authority to administer the budget”). \n \nThe authority that section 16A.152 provides to the executive branch does not involve purely legislative power, ir-\nrespective of the timing of the unallotments. See Rukavina, 684 N.W.2d at 529, 533-35 (recognizing that an allotment \nmade in conformity with the terms of section 16A.152 does not violate separation of powers). The separation of \npowers analysis is based on the “nature of the power” delegated by the statute, Lee v. Delmont, 228 Minn. at 115, 36 \nN.W.2d at 539, not the timing of the exercise of that authority. The Legislature passed legislation appropriating money \nfor the biennium and the unallotment law involves the executive branch's authority to spend the appropriated funds. \nThe Commissioner's unallotments were made in accordance with section 16A. 152 and therefore Respondents' se-\nparation of powers claim must be rejected by the Court.[FN11] \n \nFN11. Since Respondents admit that section 16A.152 is constitutional, see supra pp. 2, 23, the issue of \nwhether the statute contains, or is required to contain, a standard for application of the statute, see, e.g., Lee v. \nDelmont, 228 Minn. at 112-14, 36 N.W.2d at 538-39; Anderson, 267 Minn. at 311-13, 126 N.W.2d at 780-82, \nis not before the Court. However, the statute does satisfy applicable law. \n \n*29 Respondents' separation of powers argument is based on their disagreement with the manner in which the Gov-\nernor interacted with the Legislature during the 2009 legislative session. See A10-Al1, A22-A23; Transcript at 14-15, \n18-19; Pls.' Mem. in Supp. TRO Mot. at 10-11, 25, 27. The Governor, however, was not obligated under the law to call \na special session or veto the appropriation bills.[FN12] Nor were the Governor and Legislature required to agree to a \nbalanced budget during the session. Respondents' policy concerns are not a basis for a separation of powers claim. \nMoreover, the legislative branch is ultimately in the position to consider amendments to section 16A. 152 in order to \nset the conditions as to when unallotment authority is used in the future. See, e.g., Sviggum, 732 N.W.2d at 323 (re-\ncognizing that “it is the legislature and not the judiciary that has the institutional competency to devise a prospective \nplan for resolving future political impasses”). \n \nFN12. Respondents also claim that the Governor should have line-item vetoed funding for the MSA-SD \nprogram instead of unalloting. A23. The Governor is under no legal obligation to veto any particular ap-\npropriation. In addition, funding for the MSA-SD program was not subject to a line-item veto because there \nwas no separate appropriation for that program. Rather, the MSA-SD program is funded from the large, \ngeneral appropriation for all the various MSA grants, which is $33.93 million for FY 2010 and $35.191 \nmillion for FY 2011. Minnesota Session Laws 2009, ch. 79, art. 13, § 3, subd. 4(j) (A127). See Minn. Const. \nart. IV, § 23 (“If a bill presented to the governor contains several items of appropriation of money, he may \nveto one or more of the items while approving the bill.”); Inter Faculty Org. v. Carlson, 487 N.W.2d 192, 195 \n(Minn. 1991) (“An ‘item of appropriation of money’ is a separate and identifiable sum of money appropriated \nfrom the general fund dedicated to a specific purpose.”). \n \n*30 CONCLUSION \n \nFor the reasons stated, the Court should reverse the judgment of the district court. \n \nDeanna BRAYTON, et al., Respondents, v.

The Role of the Executive Branch in Developing and Implementing the State's Budget. \n \nThe creation of a biennial budget under Minnesota law is intended to be a structured process requiring input and participation \nby both the executive and legislative branches. The process begins with the Commissioner of Management and Budget who is \nrequired to prepare a series of forecasts of revenues and expenditures. Minn. Stat. § 16A.103, subd. 1 (2008). \n \nThe budget decisions that are at issue in the present litigation were made by the Governor and Legislature in May and June, \n2009. Consequently, the material facts related to the present litigation involve the budget projections available to the legislative \nand executive branches in the months immediately before May and June 2009, when budget decisions were being made. \n\n2010 WL 770968 (Minn.)   Page 6 \n \nThe basic numbers available to both the legislative and executive branches during deliberations concerning the 2010/2011 \nbiennial budget were provided by the Commissioner of Management and Budget in his February 2009 budget forecast. See \nAppellants'Appendix (“A”) at A51-62. Under this February forecast, the probable receipts for the general fund in the coming \n2010-2011 biennium were anticipated to be $30.7 billion. Id. Based on these anticipated receipts, the February 2009 forecast \npredicted a 2010-201 deficit of $4.570 billion.[FN1] Id. (A comparable deficit ($4.847 billion) had previously been anticipated in \nthe November 2008 forecast.) A38-50. On March 17, 2009, the Governor submitted to the Legislature a revised budget which \nagain recognized the deficit projected in the February forecast. See Respondents' Appendix (“RA”) at RA4-22. \n \nFN1. The February 2009 forecast projected a $236 million dollar balance for the end of the 2008-2009 biennium. \nNumbers from March and April 2009 later showed a decline in actual revenues of about $46 million. This reduction \nlowered the projected balance from 2009 and therefore increased the projected deficit in the coming biennium. A63-66. \nThis potential increase in the deficit, however, was unrelated to the anticipated receipts for the coming biennium, \nwhich remained projected at $30.7 billion. \n \nBased upon the existing public record, the following facts are established. At the beginning May of 2009, the probable receipts \nfor the general fund in the coming 2010-2011 biennium were anticipated to be $30.7 billion. A51-62. Given $30.7 billion in \nanticipated receipts for the coming biennium, both the legislative and executive branches understood that the state faced a \npotential budget deficit in excess of $4.57 billion. A51-62. \n \nIn May of 2009, the Legislature presented its biennial budget to the Governor through the submission of a series of appropri-\nation and revenue bills. Cuts were made by the Legislature in an attempt to reduce the projected deficit. In May, Governor \nPawlenty signed each of the appropriations bills passed by the Legislature. See 2009 Minn. Laws at 134, 168, 542, 690, 1024, \n1315, 1353, 1427, 1475, 1654, 1873, 1996 and 2446. These bills included H.F. No. 1362 (ch. 79), the Omnibus Health and \nHuman Services bill which included the appropriation for the Minnesota Supplement Aid (MSA) special diet program. 2009 \nMinn. Laws 991. \n \nIn a letter dated May 14, 2009, Governor Tim Pawlenty notified the Speaker of the House that he signed H.F. 1362 (subject to \na line-item veto involving General Assistance Medical Care). In this letter, he also announced “related, anticipated unallot-\nments.” See, Respondents' Addendum (“R. Add.)at 1-2. On the same day that the appropriations were signed into law, the \nGovernor announced his intention to unallot. R. Add. 1-2. On May 14, 2009, when the Governor announced anticipated un-\nallotments, the anticipated receipts for the general fund remained as in the February forecast, projected at $30.7 billion. A51-62. \n \nBased upon the anticipated receipts for the coming biennium as understood on May 14, 2009 (i.e. $30.7 billion), the Legislature \npassed and the Governor signed into law appropriations that exceeded the state's projected revenues by approximately 2.7 \nbillion. R. Add. 1-2. At this point, the Legislature and the Governor had enacted laws that created a potential deficit. On May 14, \nthis potential deficit of $2.7 billion was known and anticipated. \n \nOn May 18, 2009, the Legislature then passed and submitted to the Governor HF 2323 (Chapter 179), a bill that increased taxes \nand delayed some expenditures by approximately $2.7 billion. Journal of the House 2009 Supplement, at 7481, available at: \nhttp://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/cco/journals/2009-10/Jsupp2009.htm#7481. This bill contained provisions for the increased \nrevenue that would cover the appropriations already signed into law by Governor Pawlenty. It thereby produced a balanced \nbudget from the Legislature for the 2010/2011 biennium. \n \nOn May 21, 2009, after allowing the legislative session to end, the Governor vetoed the May 18 revenue bill, HF 2323. RA28. \nIn doing so, the Governor chose not to resolve through the legislative process the projected deficit of approximately $2.7 billion \ncreated on May 14. Fiscal Analysis Department, Minnesota House of Representatives, Chapter 179 (HF 2323/SF 2074) \nConference Committee Report May 18, 2009 - - Vetoed (showing a $2.7 billion deficit under the enacted budget bills and a \n$3,625  balance  if  H.F.  2323  had  been  enacted  into  law,  rather  than  vetoed),  available  at:  http:// \nwww.house.leg.state.mn.us/fiscal/files/tax09.pdf. The Governor's veto of this bill resulted in the legislative session ending \n\n2010 WL 770968 (Minn.)   Page 7 \nwithout a balanced budget. No special session was called. \n \nWhen the legislative session ended in May of 2009, the anticipated revenue for the 2010-2011 biennium remained projected, as \nit had been in February, at $30.7 billion. The projected deficit of $2.7 billion, and the unallotment promised in the Governor's \nMay 14 letter were unrelated to any change in the probable receipts for the general fund for the coming biennium. \n \nOnce a budget is developed by the Legislature and signed into law by the Governor, it is the responsibility of the executive \nbranch to implement that budget. Minn. Const. Art. § 3, Minn. Stat. § 16A.055 (2008). The Commissioner of Management and \nBudget is required to set allotments consistent with the legislative appropriations. Minn. Stat. § 16A.14 (2008), R. Add. 3. This \nis accomplished by first having each agency submit spending plans for the next allotment period certifying, among other things, \nthat the amounts requested are consistent with legislative intent. Minn. Stat. § 16A.14, subd. 3 (2008), R. Add. 3. The Com-\nmissioner must then verify and approve that spending plans are within the amount and purpose of the appropriation. Minn. Stat. \n§ 16A.14, subd. 4 (2008), R. Add. 4. Then, and only then, is the allotment established. \n \nOn May 14, 2009, as noted above, Governor Pawlenty announced in a letter to the Speaker of the House that he would use \nunallotment to balance the budget. R. Add. 1-2. He did this before any spending plans could have been presented and before any \nallotments could be approved for the legislative appropriations. \n \nB. Unallotments by the Executive Branch for the 2010-2011 Biennium. \n \nImmediately following the conclusion of the legislative session, the Governor and Commissioner Hanson took steps to im-\nplement the Governor's May 14, 2009, announcement that he would use unallotment. By the unilateral action of unallotment, \nrather than by line-item veto or by legislation in a special session, the Governor decided the manner in which the budget would \nbe balanced. \n \nHere is the manner in which the Governor sought to justify the use of unallotment: On June 4, 2009, Commissioner Hanson sent \nGovernor Pawlenty a letter stating that the State's revenues were not going to be sufficient to support the spending authorized \nfor the 2010/2011 biennium. Add. 5-6. Commissioner Hanson then did a comparison. He looked at his November 2008 forecast \nand compared it to his February 2009 forecast. Add. 5. He did not mention that both the Governor and the Legislature had relied \nonly on the February 2009 forecast in forming the legislation passed or vetoed in May, 2009. Add. 5-6. Instead, the Commis-\nsioner reported that the revenues in the February 2009 forecast were less than he had anticipated in the forecast of November \n2008.[FN2] Add. 5. \n \nFN2. He also mentions a $70 million decline in 2009 revenues from amounts projected. Add. 5. As mentioned in \nfootnote 1, such a reduction in revenue would reduce the projected balance from 2008-2009 below the $236 million \nprojected as of February 2009. While a lower balance from 2009 would add to the deficit, it is not related to probable \nreceipts for 2010-2011. From February 2009 through June 2009, probable receipts remained projected at $30.7 billion. \n \nBased on the public record, it is beyond dispute that Governor Pawlenty and the Legislature were both fully aware that $30.7 \nbillion was the estimate of revenue upon which both the enacted budget and unallotment were based. These revenue estimates \nwere published by the Minnesota Department of Management and Budget (MMB) in its February forecast. MMB, February \nForecast (February 2009). A51-62. The February forecast showed $30,700 million in “current resources.” MMB, General \nFund, Fund Balance Analysis, February 2009 Forecast (March 3, 2009), p. 1, row titled “Subtotal current resources” and \ncolumn titled “2-09 Fcst FY 2010-11”. Ex. 1 to Marx Affidavit.[FN3] RA56-72. This is in fact the same number acknowledged \nby Commissioner Hanson in his June 4, 2010 letter to Governor Pawlenty. Add. 5 \n \nFN3. Note: Cited MMB documents state numbers in thousands of dollars. They are rounded here to millions of dollars. \n \nNevertheless, having justified unallotment by comparing projections of November 2008 with projections of February 2009, \nCommissioner Hanson then recommended reductions to thirty-eight separate state expenditures. A69-79. Many of these re-\n\n2010 WL 770968 (Minn.)   Page 8 \nductions amounted to a complete elimination of funding for the programs chosen. A69-79. At least seventeen of the proposed \nreductions were scheduled to go into effect on the very first day of the biennium, July 1, 2009. A69-67. Another seven programs \nwould be unallotted during the first year of the biennium. A69-79. The MSA special diet (MSA-SD) program was slated for \nunallotment on November 1, 2009. A76. Of the twenty-four programs to be unallotted during the first year of the biennium, \nonly two were scheduled to take effect after the start of the next legislative session. A69-79. \n \nC. Unallotments of Funding for the MSA-SD Program \n \nThe unallotments formally announced on June 16, 2009 included the elimination of funding for the MSA-SD program for the \nentire biennium. A69-79. Funding for the MSA program was included by the Legislature as part of the Omnibus Health and \nHuman Services bill. 2009 Minn. Laws at 991. The entire MSA program was funded through a single appropriation, without \ndivision for the basic needs grant or any of the various special needs payments. \n \nAppellants, as they did with the specific elimination of the MSA-SD program, repeatedly used the unallotment process to \nimplement the Governor's view of proper spending priorities. In numerous cases, Appellants effected funding reductions for \nprograms through unallotment in exactly the same manner that the Governor had originally tried to achieve in unsuccessful \nbudget proposals to the Legislature.[FN4] Through unallotment the Governor unilaterally implemented legislative proposals that \nwere specifically rejected by the Legislature. \n \nFN4. For example the Governor's unallotment to the Renter Property Tax Refund Program exactly mirrored his earlier \nbudget proposal. The Governor proposed in his budget that the program benefits be reduced by reducing the statutorily \nprescribed percentage of rent constituting property tax from 19% to 15%. Governor's Budget Recommendation, Fiscal \nYears  2010-2011,  Tax  Policy,  Aid  and  Credits  p.  17,  available  at  http:// \nwww.mmb.state.mn.us/doc/budget/narratives/gov09/tax-policy. The Legislature rejected this recommendation. HF \n1136 was introduced to amend the statute in this way. The bill failed to move out of committee. See https:// \nwww.revisor.mn.gov/revisor/pages/search_status/status_detail.php?b=House&f=H F1136&ssn=0&y=2009. \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nA. Minn. Stat. § 16A.152 subd. 4 Authorizes the Commissioner of Management and Budget (MMB) and the Governor to \nReduce Spending if and Only if Specified Conditions are Met. In June 2009, Appellants Exceeded the Authority Given by This \nStatute. \n \nAppellants argue that this case should be resolved based upon a plain reading of Stat. § 16A.152 subd. 4. Respondents agree. \nHowever, Appellants' interpretation of the statute both ignores and subverts its plain meaning. \n \nOn May 14, 2009, the Governor announced he would use the unallotment statute to balance the budget. R. Add. 1-2. At that \ntime, and throughout June when the unallotments were identified and later applied, the Governor knew that there would be a \nshortfall for the next [2010/2011] biennium. Did this shortfall exist because probable receipts for the next biennium were going \nto be less than anticipated? No. Throughout May and June of 2009, the probable receipts were forecasted to be $30.7 billion. \nThis is the amount set by Appellant Hanson in the February 2009 forecast. This is the amount that formed the basis for the \nLegislature's and for the Governor's own budget proposals-the probable receipts were anticipated and known. \n \nThroughout their brief, Appellants discuss the Governor's authority or power to reduce a budget shortfall. In each instance, they \nfail to mention that this authority is limited. It only exists if the shortfall is “unanticipated.” Appellants have no statutory au-\nthority to reduce allotments simply because the Governor decides to sign into law appropriations when he clearly knew that the \nappropriations exceeded anticipated revenues by $2.7 billion. This is precisely what occurred on May 14, 2009. On this date, \nthe Governor was aware of the revenues that were projected to be available for the biennium ($30.7 billion) and nevertheless \nchose to sign into law appropriation bills that exceeded the anticipated revenues. \n \n\n2010 WL 770968 (Minn.)   Page 9 \nIf the Governor was not willing to sign a revenue bill to fund the appropriation bills presented to him in May, then the only \noptions available to him under the Minnesota Constitution to reach a balanced budget for the next biennium were to veto one or \nmore appropriation bills outright, or to use the line-item veto to reduce individual items of appropriations, or to call a special \nsession. There is no Minnesota statute that gives him the authority to rewrite the budget or to otherwise reorder legislative \nspending priorities or to amend statutory language. \n \nAppellants argue that the district court failed to apply or analyze the language of the statute and that the district court miscon-\nstrued the statute by considering the timing of the Governor's actions. However, the court's order clearly applied the statute to \nthe facts of this case. After considering the facts, the district court concluded that the “[Governor] used the unallotment statute \nto address a situation that was neither unknown nor unanticipated when the appropriation bills became law.” Add. 12 (emphasis \nadded). This is precisely the legal analysis required by the law, because the express language of the statute requires a temporal \ninterpretation in two places. The statute requires both that receipts be “less than anticipated” and that there be insufficient funds \n“for the remainder of the biennium.” \n \nIn order to compare whether receipts are less than anticipated, there must be a starting reference point or baseline for receipts \nand revenues. For the 2010/2011 budget, that baseline is the one used by both Appellants and the Legislature when creating the \nbudget - the February 2009 forecast. See Amicus Curiae Brief from the House to the District court, RA120, 128, and Ex. 2 to \nMarx Affidavit. RA73-91. See also Appellants' Brief at 13. That the budget did not balance is not because receipts or revenues \nwere less than anticipated. They were known and for the most part unchanged throughout the process.[FN5] The budget did not \nbalance because the Governor signed all of the appropriation bills without using the line-item veto to eliminate sufficient \nportions to achieve a balanced budget, and then chose not to sign the revenue bill passed by the Legislature to pay for the \nappropriations he signed into law. \n \nFN5. There was a slight reduction in revenues between the February 2009 forecast and May of 2009 as evidenced by \nthe April update; however, a reduction of $.07 billion ($70 million) in the projected FY 2009 balance cannot justify \nunallotments totaling 2.7 billion dollars. Moreover, this decline was in fact anticipated and known in May when the \nGovernor signed the Health and Human Services appropriations bill into law. A63-66. \n \nThe statute's second requirement that funds be less than needed for the “remainder of the biennium” also requires a temporal \ninterpretation. In order to have a remainder, some portion of the biennium - a period of time - must have already passed. When \nthe Governor announced on May 14, 2009 that he would use unallotment to balance the budget no part of the biennium had \npassed. \n \nB. If the Unallotment Statute is Ambiguous or Otherwise Interpreted to Permit Appellants' Unallotments, Then the Statute is \nUnconstitutional. \n \nAppellants also argue that if the Court deems the statute ambiguous then factors weigh in favor of their interpretation of the \nstatute. However, Appellants fail to address the fundamental problem created by this argument. A statute delegating legislative \nauthority to reduce appropriations must be clear. Lee v. Delmont, 36 N.W.2d 530, 538 (Minn. 1949). See also City of Richfield \nv. Local No. 1215, Int'l Ass'n. of Fire Fighters, 276 N.W.2d 42, 45 (Minn. 1979) If the unallotment statute is at all ambiguous \nthen it is constitutionally infirm. \n \nAppellants and the Amici Professors assert that Respondents admitted that the unallotment statute is constitutional. This is \nsimply not true. This case is now before the Court following the district court's order granting Respondents' request for a \ntemporary restraining order. In order to obtain a temporary restraining order, Respondents had to demonstrate a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits. Respondents raised the constitutionality of the statute in both their complaint and the brief in support of \ntheir motion. However, at the outset of the hearing on Respondents' motion, the district court stated that as a result of the Court \nof Appeals ruling in Rukavina v. Pawlenty, 684 N.W.2d 525 (Minn. Ct. App. 2004) - a ruling the District court was required to \nfollow - the statute is constitutional. Transcript at 8. Given the need to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits, \nRespondents simply clarified at the hearing that they were not there to argue the constitutionality of the statute. Transcript at 6, \n\n2010 WL 770968 (Minn.)   Page 10 \n45. This choice of arguments at a Temporary Restraining Order hearing is a far cry from an admission that the statute is con-\nstitutional. \n \nRespondents' position remains the same as argued in their memorandum in support of their Temporary Restraining Order. A \nruling in this case does not have to reach constitutional questions because the statute is clear. Because probable receipts and \nrevenues for the 2010/2011 biennium were known, Appellants had no authority to reduce allotments. However, in the event the \nCourt determines that the language of the statute does permit Appellants to reduce allotments under the facts now before the \nCourt, then both the Governor's use of the statute and the statute itself is an unconstitutional violation of the Separation of \nPowers doctrine.[FN6] \n \nFN6. Because the Trial Court was compelled to follow the Court of Appeals holding in Rukavina, only the first of \nthese issues (i.e. The Governor's inappropriate use of the statute) is raised by the district court's decision in this appeal, \nhowever this Court can address the latter issue (i.e. the statute itself is unconstitutionally vague) if the interest of jus-\ntice so require. Minn. R. Civ. App. Pro. 103.04 (2009). \n \nARGUMENT \n \nI. APPELLANTS MISREAD BOTH MINN. STAT. § 16A.152 AND THE RULING IN RUKAVINA V. PAWLENTY WHEN \nTHEY CLAIM AUTHORITY TO REDUCE AN ITEM OF APPROPRIATION PRIOR TO THE START OF A NEW FIS-\nCAL BIENNIUM. \n \nThe budgeting system that we have in Minnesota is straightforward. Finances are handled in a biennium, a two-year cycle. The \nrevenues and expenditures for the two-year fiscal cycle are to balance.[FN7] Pursuant to the Minnesota Constitution, it is the duty \nof both *15 the Legislature - the branch that passes our spending and revenue laws - and the Governor, who signs appropriation \nand revenue bills after they are presented to him - to balance the budget. Minn. Const. art. XI, § 6. The Governor asks the Court \nto ignore his primary constitutional duty to sign into law revenue and appropriation bills achieving a balanced budget in the first \nplace, and then to authorize him effectively to enact his own spending priorities (which were not achieved through the legis-\nlative process) through use of the allotment reduction statute. The result of the Governor's request is to ask the Court to ratify his \nability wholly to disregard the Legislature's constitutional role in setting the state's spending priorities in order to replace them \nwith those of the executive branch. \n \nFN7. Prior to 1973, the budget was to be brought into balance every quarter (three months). It was under this quarterly \nbudget balancing requirement that Governor Stassen first cited a need for what was later enacted as the unallotment \nstatute. In 1973, the time period was extended to one year. Since 1981, the requirement to balance the budget is applied \nto the biennium. The extension of time provides the State with a longer period during which it can recover from un-\nanticipated fiscal problems. RA37-52 (Legislative History of Unallotment Power). \n \nA. Appellants Have no Authority to Reduce Allotments Unless There is an Unanticipated Shortfall in Receipts and Revenues \nDuring a Biennium. \n \nThe authority to reduce allotments, or “unallot,” is set forth in Minn. Stat. § 16A.152 subd. 4 (the “unallotment statute”). \nAmong other things, it provides: \n• (a) If the commissioner determines that probable receipts for the general fund will be less than anticipated, and that the amount \navailable for the remainder of the biennium will be less than needed, the commissioner shall... reduce the amount in the budget \nreserve account as needed to balance expenditures with the revenue (emphasis added). \n• (b) An additional deficit shall... be made up by reducing unexpended allotments of any prior appropriation or transfer. The \ncommissioner is empowered to defer or suspend prior statutorily created obligations which would prevent effecting such re-\nductions. \n \n*16 The unallotment statute cannot be used unless certain conditions are met to trigger the application of the statute. There must \n\n2010 WL 770968 (Minn.)   Page 11 \nbe a decrease in “probable receipts” so that the receipts become “less than anticipated.” If this unanticipated decline in receipts \ncaused a shortfall for “the remainder of the biennium,” the authority to unallot is conferred. Absent these triggers, there is no \nauthority to unallot conferred by the statute. \n \nB. Appellants Deviated From the Law. \n \nWhat occurred in 2008 and 2009? The following chronology traces the relevant events as they pertain to the Governor's un-\nallotments[FN8]: \n \nFN8. This chronology is focused on the unallotment of the MSA-Special Diet program, but it is equally applicable to \nthe unallotment of the Renter Property Tax Refund program and other allotment reductions by considering the dates \nthat the other appropriations bills were passed, presented and signed into law by the Governor between May 4 and \nMay 21, 2009. \n \nNovember, 2008  Commissioner of Management and Budget forecasts a \ndeficit of $4.847 billion based upon anticipated receipts \nof $31.866 billion. A38-39. \n    \nJanuary, 2009  Governor submits a proposed budget with anticipated \nreceipts of $34.221 billion. RA6. \n    \nFebruary, 2009  Commissioner provides a revised forecast - still re-\nflecting a deficit of $4.847 billion based upon antic-\nipated receipts of $30.700 billion. A54 \n    \nMarch, 2009  Governor submits a revised budget with anticipated \nreceipts of $29.905 billion. RA26. \n    \nApril, 2009  The Department of Management and Budget issues an \neconomic update showing that receipts for March and \nApril of 2009 were $46 million less than projected in \nthe February forecast. A63. \n    \nMay 11, 2009  Legislature passes and sends HF 1362, the Health and \nHuman Services appropriations bill to the Governor for \napproval. \n    \nMay 14, 2009  the Governor signs HF 1362 into law, with one item \nsubject to a line-item veto. R. Add. 1-2. \n    \nMay 14, 2009  Governor announces that he will use the unallotment \nstatute to balance the budget. R. Add. 1-2. \n    \nMay 18, 2009  Legislature passes HF 2323, the revenue bill which \nwould have resulted in a balanced budget, and sends it \n\n2010 WL 770968 (Minn.)   Page 12 \nto the Governor for approval. \n    \nMay 21, 2009  Governor vetoes the revenue bill. RA28. \n    \nJune 16, 2009  Governor announces allotment reductions, including \nthe reductions at issue in this litigation. A69-79. \n    \nJuly 1, 2009  Biennium begins. \n \n*17 When in the course of these events did the probable receipts for the general fund become “less than anticipated”? The \nanswer is “Never.” \n \nPrior to the enactment of any appropriation and prior to the veto of any revenue bill, everyone involved in the process knew that \nrevenues were projected to be $30.7 billion. The Governor's own proposals, as well as the bills enacted by the Legislature relied \non this forecast. There was nothing unknown, and there was nothing unanticipated. Appellants were fully aware of the pro-\njected receipts available for spending in the 2010/2011 biennium. \n \nWhen in the course of these events did the Governor become authorized to use “unallotment” authority granted by statute? The \nanswer is “Never.” \n \nC. The Plain Language of the Statute Controls the Outcome of This Case. \n \n*18 When interpreting a statute, the court first looks to the plain language of the statute. Munger v. State, 749 N.W.2d 335, 338 \n(Minn. 2008). If the meaning of the statute is unambiguous, it is interpreted according to its plain language. Molloy v. Meier, \n679 N.W.2d 711, 723 (Minn. 2004). The statutory triggers for the use of unallotment authority have never been met. The \nGovernor's actions are not an attempt to adjust expenditures “for the remainder of the biennium” on the grounds that the pro-\njected “probable receipts for the general fund will be less than anticipated.” The Governor's actions are not authorized by law. \n \n1. It is Appellants and not the District Court that Read Language Into the Statute \n \nAppellants argue that the district court read language into the unallotment statute-a temporal limitation. This misstates the \ndistrict court's opinion. The district court construed the statute according to its plain language. Statutory construction requires \nthat legislative intent controls and that every law shall be construed, if possible, to give effect to all its provisions. Minn. Stat. § \n645.16 (2008). A statute is to be construed “as a whole so as to harmonize and give effect to all its parts, and where possible, no \nword, phrase, or sentence will be held superfluous, void, or insignificant.” In re United Health Group Inc., 754 N.W.2d 544, \n563 (Minn. 2008). \n \nAppellants repeatedly omit the words “less than anticipated” when discussing the language of the unallotment statute or the \npower it conveys to the executive. The statute does not convey the authority to prevent all budget deficits to the Governor, only \nthose that are unanticipated. The district court correctly applied this standard when it stated *19 that the Governor used the \nunallotment statute to address a situation that was “neither unknown nor unanticipated.” Add. 12. The district court was also \ncorrect when it stated that the authority to unallot is intended to save the state in time of a “previously unforeseen” budget crisis. \nAdd. 12. The unallotment statute is triggered only when probable receipts are “less than anticipated.” Consequently, deter-\nmining whether the statute is being properly applied requires a court to consider what was known or unknown, anticipated or \nunanticipated. \n \nThe canons of construction also dictate that words and phrases are construed according to their common approved usage. Minn. \nStat. § 645.08 (2008). The unallotment statute has two phrases joined by the conjunction “and”. As a result, these two phrases \n\n2010 WL 770968 (Minn.)   Page 13 \nmust be read together to understand when reductions can occur. The Commissioner must determine that probable receipts for \nthe general fund will be less than anticipated, and that the amount available for the remainder of the biennium will be less than \nneeded. In addition to ignoring whether receipts were less than anticipated - they were not - Appellants also fail to address the \nnecessary meaning the Court must give to the qualifying language in the second part of the statute - “for the remainder of the \nbiennium.” \n \nProbable receipts and the amount available are two sides of the same coin. The receipts generate the revenue. But the inclusion \nof the word “remainder” in the phrase “for the remainder of the biennium” has to be given some meaning. Words are to be \nconstrued according to their common meaning. Minn. Stat. § 645.08(1) (2008). A remainder is only part of the whole. This \nprovision makes little sense unless the use of *20 the statute is restricted to those situations where a budget shortfall - antic-\nipated receipts and the amount available - is discovered after the biennium begins. Appellants' interpretation of the statute \nrenders the word “remainder” superfluous. For Appellants' arguments to prevail, the Court must substitute the phrase “next \nbiennium,”[FN9] for the actual statutory phrase “remainder of the biennium.” Respondents, on the other hand, are simply asking \nthe Court to read the statute in its entirety, giving effect to all of its words and provisions. In so doing, this Court should affirm \nthe decision of the district court. \n \nFN9. This is in essence what Appellant Hanson inserted by adding “[2010-2011]” between the words “remainder of \nthe” and “biennium” in his letter dated June 4, 2009, to announce that reduction in allotments would be necessary to \nbalance the budget. Add. 5 \n \n2. The Unallotment Statute Must be Read in Conjunction With the Other Provisions of Minnesota Statutes Chapter 16A \n \nIn addition to the plain language of the unallotment statute -limiting its application to situations where there truly is an unan-\nticipated shortfall-there are statutory provisions that must be followed before the Commissioner can make an allotment. It \nnecessarily follows that these conditions must be met before the Commissioner can make an unallotment. See e.g., Knopp v. \nGutterman, 102 N.W.2d 689, 641 (Minn. 1960) (“In construing a legislative act, a section thereof is not to be considered apart \nfrom other sections of the act, but the act is to be read and construed as a whole.”) (citations omitted). \n \nBefore the Commissioner can make an allotment, agencies must first submit spending plans for the next allotment period. \nThese spending plans must certify, among other things, that the amounts requested are consistent with legislative intent, Minn. \nStat. § 16A. 14 subd. *21 3 (2008). The level of an appropriation demonstrates the legislative intent. Following this, the \nCommissioner must approve spending plans if they are within the amount and purpose of the appropriation. Minn. Stat. § 16A. \n14 subd. 4 (2008)., R. Add. 3-4. \n \nThese conditions further support an interpretation that the Legislature did not intend the statute permitting a reduction in al-\nlotments to be available for use by Appellants as an initial budget balancing tool. Considering these additional relevant provi-\nsions of the law lends added support to Respondents' analysis of whether and when allotments can legally be reduced. Minn. \nStat. §§ 645.16, 645.17 (2008). \n \nThe legislative appropriation for the Health and Human Services budget embodied the legislative intent to fund all of the \nprograms included within it including a decision by the Legislature to fund the MSA special diet program. It was signed into \nlaw by the Governor on May 14, 2009. On that same day, Governor Pawlenty announced that he would use the unallotment \nstatute to balance the budget. He did this before any spending plans certifying that they are consistent with legislative intent \ncould have been presented, and before any allotments could be approved for the appropriation. Indeed, the Department of \nHuman Services could not certify that a spending plan would be consistent with legislative intent if it did not contain any \nfunding for the special diet program and the Commissioner could not approve such a plan. It defies logic to suggest that these \nother provisions contained within Chapter 16A can and should be ignored when considering whether the preconditions in the \nunallotment statute may be triggered. \n \nThe fact that there must first be spending plans certifying compliance with legislative intent also lends support to the meaning \n\n2010 WL 770968 (Minn.)   Page 14 \nof the phrase “for the remainder of the *22 biennium.” Minn. Stat. § 16A. 152 subd. 4 cannot be interpreted to apply before a \nbiennium begins and where there has been no initial allotment that follows the requirements of Minn. Stat. § 16A.14. R. Add. \n3-4. \n \n3. Appellants' Interpretation of the Statute Leads to an Absurd or Unreasonable Result. \n \nCourts “are not to assume that the Legislature will engage in a futile act nor attribute to it an intent to bring about an absurd or \nunreasonable result.” Knopp, 102 N.W.2d at 695. “A construction of a statute which will lead to an impracticable and absurd \nresult is to be avoided if the language used will reasonably bear any other construction.” Id. \n \nAccording to Appellants' logic, as set forth in Commissioner Hanson's June 4, 2009 letter justifying unallotment, the decline in \nprojected revenues from the Commissioner's November 2008 forecast to his February 2009 forecast was “unanticipated” and \ntherefore sufficient to confer on the Governor the statutory power to unallot. In this view of the law, nothing that occurs after \nFebruary 2009 is of legal significance. After the February forecast, the Governor can sign any appropriation bill and can veto \nany revenue bill; then, having enacted into law a budget deficit, the Governor can implement his legislative priorities by use of \nunallotment. Appellants' logic leads to this absurd result. \n \nThe “trigger” for the use of unallotment power under this interpretation was pulled in February, before the Governor submitted \nhis revised proposed budget to the Legislature, before the Legislature passed any of its appropriation bills for the next *23 \nbiennium and before the Governor signed those bills into law-in sum, before any shortfall in the budget occurred. If this reading \nof the statute does not render it and the Governor's actions unconstitutional, it is difficult to imagine what would. \n \n4. If the Unallotment Statute is Ambiguous Then it is an Unconstitutional Delegation of Legislative Power, and There is \nNothing for the Court to Construe. \n \nAppellants argue that if the statute is deemed to be ambiguous, then the Court may construe the statute by considering other \nfactors. The flaw in this argument is that the unallotment statute involves a delegation of legislative power. Such a delegation \ncan be made only if the law provides a “reasonably clear policy or standard of action which controls administrative officers in \nascertaining the operative facts.” Lee v. Delmont, 36 N.W.2d 530, 538 (Minn. 1949). See also City of Richfield v. Local No. \n1215, Int'l Ass'n of Fire Fighters, 276 N.W.2d 42, 45 (Minn. 1979) (“where the law embodies a reasonably clear policy or \nstandard to guide and control administrative officers...then the delegation of power will be constitutional.”). \n \nIf the statute is at all ambiguous, then it fails the critical requirement of providing clear policies or standards of action. As a \nresult, the statute would be unconstitutional and there is nothing for the Court to construe. \n \na. The Purpose of the Unallotment Statute is Limited to Addressing Unanticipated Budget Deficits. \n \nAppellants argue that the purpose of the unallotment statute is to “prevent budget deficits and avert financial crises.” Appel-\nlants' Brief at 17. What Appellants neglect to mention is that the purpose of the statute does not apply to all budget deficits. \nRather, its *24 purpose is aimed only at addressing unanticipated budget deficits. Appellants also claim that the purpose is to \nprevent financial crises. However, this sweeping statement fails to consider that the current crisis was caused by the Governor's \nown actions when he knowingly signed into law appropriation bills that exceeded the anticipated revenues for the 2010-2011 \nbiennium. Appellants cannot create a financial crisis and use that as a rationale to interpret the statute in their favor. \n \nb. Appellants' Arguments of a Potential Government Shutdown are Speculative and Without Merit. \n \nAppellants assert that the Commissioner's interpretation avoids grave consequences - a potential government shutdown - and \nthat Respondents' interpretation does not. This completely ignores that the dire situation predicted-should it come to pass-is \nboth avoidable and the direct result of actions taken by Appellants. By failing to take any one of several options available to \nobtain a balanced budget, the Governor created the very situation he then used the unallotment statute to correct. Now he asks \n\n2010 WL 770968 (Minn.)   Page 15 \nthe Court to sanction his use of that statute because the consequences of not doing so will leave the state with the situation he \ncreated. \n \nAppellants' argument also ignores the fact that Appellants have other possible solutions at hand. Appellants can work with the \ncurrently sitting Legislature to reach agreement on additional reductions in spending or increased revenues necessary to pay for \nthe appropriation bills the Governor signed into law. And if an agreement cannot be reached by the end of the legislative session, \nthe Governor has the constitutional authority to call a special session in order to balance the biennium's budget. *25Minn. Const. \nart. IV., § 12. The Governor has a constitutional duty to insure that the laws of this state are faithfully executed. Minn. Const. art \nV, § 3. This requires him to find a solution to resolve the problem created when he signed the appropriations bills into law, but \nvetoed the revenue bill passed to pay for those appropriations. \n \nc. Courts do not Defer to an Administrative Agency's Interpretation of a Statute Where That Interpretation is Erroneous. \n \nAppellants assert that courts defer to a Commissioner's interpretation of a statute that the Commissioner administers. However, \n“[a]dministrative agencies are creatures of statute and they have only those powers given to them by the Legislature.” In re \nDenial of Certification of the Variance Granted to Robert. W. Hubbard by the City of Lakeland, 2010 WL 455278, at 7, (Minn. \n2010). (citations omitted). Neither an agency nor the courts may enlarge the agency's powers beyond that which was contem-\nplated by the legislative body. Id. Deference to the agency's determination of authority need not be given when the court con-\nsiders the threshold question of whether the Legislature granted the agency the authority to take action. Id. at 14, fn 4. \n \nMost importantly, a court is not required to defer to an administrative interpretation where it is erroneous and in conflict with \nthe express purpose of the act and the intention of the Legislature. Soo Line R.R. Co. v. Comm'r of Revenue, 277 N.W.2d 7, 10 \n(Minn. 1979). And, although Rukavina held the unallotment statute constitutional, the use of the statute in a manner similar to \nthat of Appellants in this case has never before occurred and consequently has never before been challenged. See McCloud v. \nComm ‘r Pub. Safety, 394 N.W.2d 821, 824 (Minn. 1984). (If the statutes do not support the *26 Commissioner's interpretation, \nthe significance is weak, particularly where the Commissioner's interpretation has not been challenged before.) Accordingly, \nwhether the Commissioner acted within his statutory authority is a question of law that the court reviews de novo. In re \nHubbard, 2010 WL 455278, at 7. The Commissioners' determination that Appellants were authorized to use the unallotment \nstatute, in the words of the district court, as a weapon to break a stalemate in budget negotiations with the Legislature is er-\nroneous. \n \nAppellants' public policy arguments fail. The paramount policy is that it is in the interest of all Minnesotans that statutes are \ninterpreted in such a way to avoid constitutional problems. It is also paramount that that the Constitution be followed and that \nstatutes are not interpreted to permit an unlawful delegation of power from the legislative to the executive branch, or an un-\nlawful usurpation of legislative powers by the executive branch. \n \nII. APPELLANTS' USE OF MINN. STAT § 16A.152 SUBD. 4 VIOLATES THE SEPARATION OF POWERS DOCTRINE \nCONTAINED IN ARTICLE III, SECTION 1 OF THE MINNESOTA CONSTITUTION. \n \nIt is presumed that the Legislature does not intend to violate the Constitution. Minn. Stat. § 645.17(3) (2008). A plain reading of \nthe statute supports affirming the decision of the district court. The unallotment statute as written simply did not authorize \nAppellants to ignore the legislative process and balance the 2010/2011 biennium budget through unallotment. Therefore, it is \nnot necessary for the Court to reach constitutional questions. \n \nConstitutional issues will, however, be addressed in order to respond both to Appellants' claims that the unallotments by the \nexecutive branch do not involve the *27 exercise of purely legislative power, and also to the arguments of the Amici Professors \nthat the statute is constitutional. In addition, given the number of other programs that were unallotted, and the manner in which \nsome of the reductions were made,[FN10] the interest of justice may also require the Court to consider these constitutional issues. \nMinn. R. Civ. App. Pro. 103.04 (2009). \n \n\n2010 WL 770968 (Minn.)   Page 16 \nFN10. For example, in the Renter Property Tax Refund, Appellants effected unallotment by reducing the statutorily \nprescribed percentage of rent that constitutes the property tax from 19% to 15%, See Minn. Stat. § 290A.03, subd. 11 \n(2008). \n \nThe Constitution grants the executive branch only the power to approve or to veto legislation. Minn. Const. art. IV, § 23. In the \ncase of appropriations and achieving a balanced budget for an upcoming biennium, the Constitution permits the Governor to \nexercise the veto power selectively by using a line-item veto on one or more appropriations within the bill.[FN11] Id. If a Gov-\nernor vetoes all or any portion of an appropriation bill, the Constitution grants the power to the Legislature to try to override the \nveto. Id. If the Legislature is successful, the bill becomes law despite the veto. Once the Governor signs a bill or his veto is \noverridden, he is required by the Constitution to see that the law - as enacted - is faithfully executed. Minn. Const. art. V, § 3. If \nMinn. Stat § 16A.152 were to be construed in a manner permitting the executive branch first to sign an appropriation bill into \nlaw and then to ignore its provisions from the very first day *28 the appropriations become law, then the statute is an uncons-\ntitutional delegation of legislative authority.[FN12] Minn. Const. art. III, § 1. \n \nFN11. The Minnesota Constitution is a limit to - not a grant of-legislative power, Citizens for Rule of Law v. Senate \nCommittee on Rules & Administration, 770 N.W. 2d 169,176, (Minn. Ct. App. 2009) (citations omitted) Similarly, it is \nalso a limit to executive power. During the process of achieving a balanced budget for an upcoming biennium, the \nMinnesota Constitution confers no power to the executive branch to appropriate funds or to reduce an appropriation \nother than through a line-item veto. \n \nFN12. Permitting the statute to be used in this way also leads to unreasonable and illogical results. It would permit the \nGovernor to unallot a program that he first rejected using his line-item veto of an appropriations bill even if the Leg-\nislature were to override that veto. See Knopp, 102 N.W.2d 689, Minn. Stat. § 645.17 (it is presumed that the Legis-\nlature does not intend a result that is absurd or unreasonable). See also Alaska v. Fairbanks North Star Borough, 736 \nP.2d 1140, 1143 (Alaska 1987). \n \nThe Governor simply may not arrogate to himself the power to rewrite appropriations at the beginning of a biennium without \nviolating Minnesota's Constitution. Appellants' use of unallotment before the beginning of a biennium circumvents the Leg-\nislature's prerogative to attempt to override line-item vetoes of appropriations, and represents an unconstitutional violation of \nArticle III, section 1 of the Minnesota Constitution. \n \nA. Appellants' Use of the Unallotment Statute at the Start of a Biennium is Flawed and Unprecedented. \n \nAppellants' use of the unallotment statute to balance the budget at the start of a biennium is unprecedented. This use of the \nstatute extends beyond the facts in Rukavina, a decision by the Court of Appeals that has not been addressed by the Supreme \nCourt. It contradicts the Minnesota Constitution and its history. \n \nInter Faculty Org. v. Carlson, 478 N.W.2d 192 (Minn. 1991) illustrates the flaw in Appellants' arguments. At issue in Inter \nFaculty was Governor Carlson's use of the line-item veto. Before reaching its decision, the Supreme Court analyzed the power \nconveyed by the line-item veto in Article IV, § 23 of the Constitution. Because the authority is found in Article IV of the \nConstitution, the Court found it to be an exception to the *29 authority of the Legislature, and as such “the power must be \nnarrowly construed to prevent an unwarranted usurpation by the executive of powers granted the Legislature in the first in-\nstance.” Id. at 194 (emphasis added). \n \nContrary to the arguments of the Amici Professors, if the line-item veto - as provided for in the Constitution - must be narrowly \nconstrued to prevent the usurpation by the Governor of legislative powers, then certainly a statute claimed by the Governor to \ndelegate the power to reduce appropriations must also be narrowly construed. The liberal construction urged by the Amici \nProfessors defies both logic and law. The Court in Inter Faculty Org. went on to note: \nSecond, the language of the provision itself limits the authority to the veto of “items of appropriations,” not of a part or parts of \nan item. We therefore view that power as a negative authority, not a creative one - in its exercise the power is one to strike, not \n\n2010 WL 770968 (Minn.)   Page 17 \nto add to or even to modify the legislative strategy. \n \nId. (emphasis added). Pursuant to Articles III and IV of the Minnesota Constitution, the power to pass legislation to balance the \nbudget cannot be delegated or limited beyond that provided for by the line-item veto. For the unallotment statute to pass con-\nstitutional muster, its use must be limited to those times when a shortfall is discovered after the balanced budget is complete and \nlegislative priorities established. \n \n1. The Executive Branch Does not Have the Authority to Reduce Appropriations in Order to Balance the Budget at the Be-\nginning of a Biennium. \n \n*30 Within the full context of Chapter 16A, it would be an unreasonable interpretation of the unallotment statute to permit the \nstatute to be used by the executive branch to balance the budget for an entire biennium. \n \nHistorically, Minnesota has been reluctant to accept any limitation to the power of the Legislature to set the level of appropr-\niations. In 1915, a constitutional amendment was proposed that would have given the Governor the power to reduce an ap-\npropriation in whole or in part. (This is an item reduction veto.) Id. at 194, fn2. The amendment was rejected. The authority \nAppellants now claim to have by virtue of the unallotment statute - to reduce items appropriated in whole or in part for the entire \nbiennium in order to create a balanced budget at the start of a biennium - is the equivalent of an item reduction veto. It differs in \nonly one important respect - it does not provide the Legislature with a right to try to override the reduction. \n \nIt stands to reason that if this limitation on legislative power could not be given to the executive branch absent an amendment to \nthe Constitution, then the Legislature cannot pass a statute that would have the same effect. See, e.g., Citizens for Rule of Law v. \nSenate Comm. on Rules & Admin., 770, N.W.2d 169, 176 (Minn. Ct. App. 2009) (Legislature is presumed to act in a manner \nconsistent with the Constitution). Appellants should not be permitted to do in two steps what the Constitution does not permit in \none - taking an item of appropriation just signed into law and then immediately reducing the amounts. It defies logic to conclude \nthat the Legislature can delegate such power to the Governor by statute when a proposed constitutional amendment that would \nhave done so failed. \n \n*31 2. The Holding in Rukavina Does not Support Appellants' Unprecedented Use of the Unallotment Statute. \n \nIt is consistent with the decision in Rukavina to hold that the unallotment statute does confer an ability on the executive branch \nto reduce allotments after there is an unanticipated budget shortfall discovered during a biennium while still holding that the \nstatute does not confer on the Governor the power unilaterally to create a balanced budget at the start of a biennium. \n \nThe unallotment statute was found to be constitutional by the Court of Appeals on the facts that were before the court in Ru-\nkavina. But no Minnesota court has considered the question in the context that is now before this Court. In the present case, the \nexecutive branch of government used the unallotment statute in lieu of the options available in Article IV of the Minnesota \nConstitution to achieve a balanced budget. These constitutional options included passing both appropriation and revenue bills \nto achieve a balanced budget, vetoing appropriations bills in their entirety until that result is achieved, and using the line-item \nveto to reduce appropriations to fit within anticipated revenues. Absent reaching an agreement, the Governor also had the \nauthority to call the Legislature into special session to continue to work toward resolving the budget shortfall created when the \nGovernor vetoed the revenue bill that would have resulted in a balanced budget. \n \nThe facts in Rukavina are distinctly different from those now presented to this Court. Rukavina involved a challenge to a re-\nduction in funds from the mineral fund. The funds were available, they were not encumbered or otherwise obligated, and there \nwere *32 no pending development project requests for money. In other words, the funds at issue were not needed to pay any \ncurrent ongoing obligation. Furthermore, the unallotment occurred in February of 2003, a mere four months before the end of \nthe biennium in which the shortfall occurred. In addition, the unallotment was announced at a time when the Legislature was in \nsession and could have acted on its own. Against this backdrop of facts, the Rukavina court concluded that the statute was not \nunconstitutional. The court noted that while the: \n\n2010 WL 770968 (Minn.)   Page 18 \nappropriation of money is the responsibility of the legislature under Minn. Const. Art. XI § 1, it is an annual possibility that the \nrevenue streams to fund those appropriations may be insufficient to actually realize each appropriation. For that purpose, the \nlegislature, by statute authorized the executive branch to avoid, or reduce a budget shortfall in any given biennium. \n \nRukavina, 684 N.W.2d at 535 (emphasis added). The court, further noted that “although purely legislative power cannot be \ndelegated, the Legislature may authorize others to do things ... that it might properly but cannot conveniently or advantageously \ndo itself “ Id. at 538. citing Lee v. Delmont, 36 N.W.2d at 538 (emphasis added). Lee involved the question of whether regu-\nlatory powers conferred upon a board constituted a delegation of legislative power. In holding that it did not, the court reasoned \nthat while the power to ascertain facts which automatically bring a law into operation by virtue of its own terms can be dele-\ngated, it is not the same as the power to pass, modify or annul a law. Rukavina, 684 N.W.2d at 535. This rationale does not apply \nwhen the executive branch, as in the present case, claims the power to modify or annul a duly enacted law on the very day that \nit becomes law. \n \n*33 Compare the Rukavina facts with the facts now before the Court. The court in Rukavina reached its conclusion only after \nnoting that insufficient revenue streams are an annual possibility, and that the unallotment statute authorized the executive \nbranch to reduce a budget shortfall in any given biennium. It then concluded that the statute merely enabled the executive \nbranch to deal with an anticipated shortfall before it occurs. The Rukavina court's statement concerning the constitutionality of \nthe statute must be limited to its distinctly different facts - it should not be extended to the facts now before the Court. \n \nThe premises for the holding in Rukavina do not support a similar holding in the case now before the Court. In the present case, \neconomic forecasts of probable receipts and a projected budget deficit for the next biennium dated back at least to November of \n2008. The Governor used the February 2009 forecast which noted the receipts anticipated to be available for the 2010/2011 \nbiennium when drafting and submitting his budget proposals to the Legislature. He was aware of probable anticipated receipts \nand the projected deficit when he signed numerous appropriations bills into law in May. He had a constitutional right to use his \nline-item veto authority to reduce lines in any number of appropriation bills to achieve a balanced budget based on the $30.7 \nbillion in anticipated revenue, but he chose not to do so. Instead he signed the appropriations into law, at which point he had a \nconstitutional duty to see that these laws were faithfully executed. He was also presented with an opportunity to adhere to his \nduty - the Legislature sent him a revenue bill that would have balanced the budget, but he vetoed that bill. Then, in June, he \nunilaterally rewrote the State's budget through unallotment. *34 In so doing, he not only exceeded his constitutional authority, \nhe also deprived the Legislature of its constitutional right to try to override line-item vetoes of appropriations bills. \n \nIn Rukavina, the court permitted the use of Minn. Stat § 16A.152 to divert funds that were not in use at the end of a biennium in \norder to avoid a shortfall in that biennium. This use is a far cry from the present claimed expansion of executive power unila-\nterally to balance the budget at the beginning of a biennium by eliminating statutory appropriations for disabled Minnesotans \nentitled to their receipt. \n \nThe Court should reject an overly broad interpretation of Rukavina because, “The tendency to sacrifice established principles of \nconstitutional government in order to secure centralized control and high efficiency in administration may easily be carried so \nfar as to endanger the very foundation upon which our system of government rests.” Juster Bros. v. Christgau, 7 N.W.2d 501, \n(1943) citing State ex rel. Young v. Brill, 100 Minn. 499, 520; 111 N.W. 294, 639-40 (1907). \n \n*35 B. The Unallotment Statute is Unconstitutional if the Language is Interpreted to Permit Appellants' Actions. \n \n1. A Delegation of Constitutional Power is Unconstitutional if it Does not Furnish Reasonably Clear Policy Standards or if it is \nSubject to the Whims or Caprice of Administrative Officers. \n \nPurely legislative power may not be delegated. Lee v Delmont, 36 N.W.2d at 113. For a delegation of legislative power to be \nconstitutional it must furnish “reasonably clear policy or standards of action which controls and guides the administrative \nofficers in ascertaining the operative facts to which the law applies, so that the law takes effect upon these facts by virtue of its \nown terms, and not according to the whims or caprice of the administrative officers.” Id. (emphasis added) \n\n2010 WL 770968 (Minn.)   Page 19 \n \nMinnesota's unallotment statute does not provide clear policy standards of action.[FN13] It merely states that if there is insuffi-\ncient revenue in the budget reserve the executive branch is directed to reduce unexpended allotments of any prior appropriation \nor transfer. The statute provides absolutely no guidance to the executive as to which allotments should be reduced, the priority \nof programs to be reduced, or the manner in which they are to be reduced. This fact alone demonstrates the unconstitutionality \nof the unallotment statute. \n \nFN13. The Amici Professors baldly assert that the unallotment statute satisfies the requirement for reasonably clear \npolicies or standards to guide or control the administrative branch because, among other things, it provides a priority \nfor unallotments. This is simply not true. The statute provides that the budget reserve be used first to balance ex-\npenditures with revenue, but it does not provide guidance as to priorities for unallotment. \n \nIf the Court, based upon the facts of this case, interprets the statute to permit Appellants' unallotments, that too would dem-\nonstrate the unconstitutionality of the *36 statute-because it would render it subject to the whims or caprice of the executive \nbranch. On May 14, 2009, the Governor signed the Health and Human Services appropriations bill-thereby making it law which \nthe Minnesota Constitution then required him to faithfully execute. Yet on that very same day he did an about face and an-\nnounced instead that he would use unallotments to undo what he just signed into law. His rationale for using unallotments was \nthe deficit created by his decision to sign the appropriation bills. \n \nThe system that Appellants ask this Court to sanction is one which allows the executive branch to take a budget crisis as the \noccasion for claiming authority to wrest legislative power from the Legislature. It begins with the Governor's signing appro-\npriation bills when, based upon existing projections of revenues for the biennium (in this case $30.7 billion), he knows that this \naction creates a budget shortfall. The appropriation bills under our Constitution contain spending priorities that have now been \nenacted into law both by the Legislature and the Governor. But then the Governor almost immediately announces his intention \nto reject these legally enacted spending priorities. He effects the budget shortfall by vetoing the revenue bill that would have \nbalanced the budget, and he then unilaterally reorders spending priorities. If the unallotment statute can reasonably be read to \njustify such a course of action, it violates the fundamental principles of separation of powers embodied in our Constitution. \nBoth the Governor's actions and the statute are unconstitutional. \n \n*37 2. Other Courts Reject Attempts by the Legislature to Delegate Powers Absent Clear Guidance to the Executive as to How \nthe Powers Delegated are to be Applied. \n \nCourts in other states have considered statutes very similar to Minn. Stat. § 16A.152 subd. 4 and found them to be constitu-\ntionally infirm. These decisions focus on the balance of power between the two branches of government. \n \nIn Alaska v. Fairbanks North Star Borough, 736 P.2d 1140 (Alaska 1987), the Governor of Alaska unallotted appropriated \nfunds in a manner comparable to Governor Pawlenty's unallotments at issue in the present case. Such actions were judged to be \nan unconstitutional violation of limits imposed by separation of powers. Quoting Justice Brandeis, the Alaska Supreme Court \ngave the following description of the separation of powers doctrine: \n[T]he doctrine was adopted not to promote efficiency but to preclude the exercise of arbitrary power. The purpose was not to \navoid friction, but, by means of the inevitable friction incident to the distribution of the government powers among three de-\npartments, to save the people from autocracy. \n \n736 P.2d, at 1142, citing Myers v. U.S., 272 U.S. 52, 293, 47 S. Ct. 21, 85 (1926). \n \nGovernor Pawlenty is asserting that Minn. Stat. § 16A. 152 subd. 4 provides him with unbridled power unilaterally to reduce \nstatutory allotments and to rewrite statutes (i.e. change the statutory 19% rate for calculating renters' rebates to his preferred rate \nof 15%). If Minn. Stat. § 16A.152 subd. 4 were to be interpreted to confer such power on the Governor, it would be uncons-\ntitutional. In holding the comparable Alaska statute unconstitutional, the Alaska Supreme Court rejected it because the powers \nconferred were overly broad and amounted to a legislative abdication. Id. at 1144. \n\n2010 WL 770968 (Minn.)   Page 20 \n \n*38 In rejecting the statute, the Alaska court noted that the statute articulated no principles to guide the executive, and most \nimportantly, that the executive was provided with no policy guidance as to how the cuts should be distributed. As a result, the \ncourt concluded that nothing in the statute would prevent the Governor from effectively vetoing a project where his veto had \nbeen previously overridden. As with the Alaska statute, Minn. Stat. § 16A.152 fails to articulate any principles to guide the \nexecutive or to provide any policy guidance as to how cuts should be distributed. Consequently, when it is used by the Governor \nas a tool to balance the budget unilaterally at the outset of a biennium-by modifying spending in some programs, completely \neliminating spending for other programs and effectively amending statutes it is equally infirm. See e.g., Lee, N.W.2d 538. \n \nChilds v. Children A, B, C, D, E, and F, 589 So.2d 260, (Fla. 1991) also involved the constitutionality of a statute remarkably \nsimilar to Minn. Stat. § 16A.152 subd. 4. In Childs, the court concluded that the statute was an impermissible attempt by the \nLegislature to abdicate a portion of its lawmaking responsibility and to vest it in the executive branch. Id at 267. The court's \nconclusion was based on the following analysis: The power to appropriate state funds is legislative, and it is to be exercised only \nthrough duly enacted statutes. The power to reduce appropriations is also a legislative function. The veto power is the power to \nnullify - it is not the power to alter or amend legislative intent. Therefore, the executive branch does not have the power to use \nthe veto to restructure an appropriation. The court concluded that the Legislature cannot grant by *39 statute a power to the \nexecutive branch to do at a later date what it is forbidden by the Constitution during the initial appropriations process. Id at 265. \n \nA thoughtful analysis of the principles at issue in balancing legislative and executive powers is also provided by the court in \nHunter v. State, 177 VT 339, 347, 805 A.2d 381,390 (2004). The Vermont statute dealing with “unallotment” authorized the \nGovernor to recommend reductions if, after the passage of a balanced budget, there was a reduction of 2% or more in the \namount of revenue projected at the time the budget was adopted. The recommendation would be made to a Joint Fiscal \nCommittee of the Legislature, which could review and revise the recommendation.[FN14] This alternative process for balancing \nthe budget could be used only if the Legislature was not in session. This process was held to be constitutional. The discussion of \napplicable standards for assessing the constitutionality of the process is instructive. \n \nFN14. While the Minnesota unallotment statute requires Appellants to consult with the Legislature, the Legislature did \nnot give itself the authority to revise recommended reductions. \n \nThe Vermont Supreme Court in Hunter noted: “...appropriations necessarily represent legislative determination of policy, by \ndeciding which programs and activities to support financially, and therefore who obtains intended public benefits. If the \nGovernor has a free hand to refuse to spend any appropriated funds, he or she can totally negate a legislative policy that lies at \nthe core of the legislative function.” Id. at 347, 390. However, the Vermont court went on to note that because the “activity of \nspending is essentially an executive task, the Governor is allowed some discretion to exercise his judgment not to spend money \nin a wasteful fashion, provided that he determines that such *40 a decision will not compromise the achievement of underlying \nlegislative purposes and goals.”[FN15] Id. at 348. (citing Opinion of the Justices, 375 Mass. 827; 376 N.E.2d 1217 (1978)), \n(emphasis added) See; Colo. Gen. Assembly v. Lamm, 700 P.2d 508,521 (Colo. 1985) (whatever inherent power the Governor \nhas over administering the state budget, it does not extend to contradicting major legislative determinations.). \n \nFN15. Professors Amici suggest that this spending power is to be liberally construed. However they fail to note that \nthe power at issue in Hunter involves discretion to limit wasteful spending (such as paying for snowplowing when \nthere is no snow), and requires a prior determination that the reduction will not compromise the underlying legislative \npurpose and goals. Hunter, 177 Vt. 379. In the present case Appellants' unallotments fully compromised some pro-\ngrams. Spending for the MSA Special Diet program was completely eliminated. At other times they altered legislative \nintent by changing statutory requirements. The Renter Property Tax Refund changed the statutorily prescribed amount \nof rent constituting property tax. \n \nAppellants' reliance on New England Div. of the Am. Cancer Soc'y v. Comm'r of Admin., 769 N.E.2d 1248 (Mass. 2002) to \nsupport the proposition that Appellants' unallotments fall within the Governor's spending power is misplaced. One of the key \nconcepts guiding the New England court was that “a statute may grant the Governor discretion to determine how to spend \n\n2010 WL 770968 (Minn.)   Page 21 \nappropriated funds, or, in limited circumstances, to withhold their expenditure.” Id. at 1256 (emphasis added). It cannot be said \nthat using a statute to reduce appropriations (or withhold their expenditure) by $2.7 billion falls within this concept of “limited \ncircumstances.” This is particularly true where the Governor himself created the circumstances that resulted in an unbalanced \nbudget. \n \nAdditionally in New England, as in Rukavina, a reduction in allotments was made necessary by a decline in revenues after the \nLegislature enacted its fiscal year *41 appropriations, Id. 1249-50. And, while the Court found the statute in question to be an \nexample of the executive power of expenditure, it noted: \nThe probability that the Governor might abuse her authority under §9C, to reduce, or eliminate altogether, funding for certain \nprograms based on her own ordering of social priorities, is minimal. “To the contrary, the Governor is bound to apply [her] full \nenergy and resources, in the exercise of [her] best judgment and ability, to ensure that the intended goals of legislation are \neffectuated.” \n \nId. at 1257 (citations omitted). \n \nIn the case now before the Court, it cannot be said that Governor Pawlenty applied his full energy to ensuring that the intended \ngoals of Legislation were effectuated. On the same day he signed the Human Services Appropriation bill, he announced his \nintention to ignore its provisions and unallot appropriations for the programs he just approved. It also cannot be said that he did \nnot reduce programs based on his own ordering of social priorities. Many of his unallotments were nearly identical to proposals \nhe originally submitted to the Legislature in his proposed budgets.[FN16] These were rejected by the Legislature when they \npassed their appropriations bills. At nearly the same time, he vetoed a bill that would have raised the necessary revenue to fund \nthe MSA-SD program as well as other programs which support the poor. \n \nFN16. See footnote 4. \n \nApplying well established principles of law to the unilateral actions of Governor Pawlenty in the 2009 unallotments, the powers \nclaimed by the Governor under Minn. Stat. § 16A. 152 would render the statute unconstitutional. \n \n*42 CONCLUSION \n \nThe decision of the district court should be affirmed. Judge Kathleen Gearin correctly assessed the law in her Memorandum \nsupporting the Temporary Restraining Order. She held that the manner in which the Governor exercised unallotment in 2009 \ntrod upon the constitutional power of the Legislature, and the Legislature alone, to make laws. His actions were unconstitu-\ntional. \n \nIt would dramatically change the structure of government created by the Minnesota Constitution if this Court were to sanction \na process in which this or any other Governor could sign appropriations into law, then veto revenue bills, and then use unal-\nlotment to ignore legislative appropriations and to rewrite the budget according to the Governor's own legislative priorities. \nThis in fact is what has occurred. This use of unallotment was unauthorized by any law and was unconstitutional. \n \nThe decision of the district court should be affirmed. Funding for MSA-SD and for the Renter Property Tax Refund Program \nmay not be reduced based upon the 2009 unallotment, and Appellants should be permanently enjoined from implementing any \nreductions based upon this unallotment. \n \nAppendix not available. \n \nDeanna BRAYTON, et al., Respondents, v.

Amici are concerned that the district court decision unconstitutionally usurps \nlegislative power and unnecessarily involves the judiciary in a political dispute between the legislative and executive \nbranches of government. \n \nFN1. Pursuant to Minn. R. Civ. App. P. 129.03, amici curiae state that counsel for none of the captioned \nparties authored this brief, in whole or in part, and that no other person or entity made a monetary contribu-\ntion or promise of contribution to the preparation or submission of the brief. \n \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n \nAmici curiae adopt and incorporate the factual statement presented in Appellant's brief. \n \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n \nThe district court's ruling should be reversed. The unallotment statute is a constitutional delegation of legislative \npower to the executive. In granting the temporary restraining order - ostensibly to preserve separation of powers - the \ndistrict court unconstitutionally usurped the legislative authority to enact or amend legislation in violation of the \nseparation of powers doctrine. Finally, public policy supports reversing the district court's decision, as the dispute at \nissue is a wholly political dispute to be resolved between the executive and legislative branches. \n \nARGUMENT \n \nI. The unallotment statute is a constitutional delegation of legislative power to the executive. \n \nThe power to make the laws is expressly reserved to the legislature. See, Blake v. Winona & St. Peter RR, 19 Minn. 418 \n(Gil. 362) (1873), aff'd, 94 U.S. 180 (1876). The power to execute the laws belongs to the executive. See Minn. Const. \nart. V § 3. However, “additional duties .. may be imposed on the Governor by the legislature.” State ex rel. Kinsella v. \nEberhart, 116 Minn. 313, 319, 133 N.W. 857, 860 (1912). \n \n“Although purely legislative power cannot be delegated, the legislature may authorize others to do things (insofar as \nthe doing involves powers that are not exclusively *3 legislative) that it might properly, but cannot conveniently or \nadvantageously, do itself.” Lee v. Delmont, 228 Minn. 101, 112, 36 N.W.2d 530, 538 (1949). Pure legislative power \n“is the authority to make a complete law - complete as to the time it shall take effect and as to whom it shall apply - and \nto determine the expediency of its enactment.” Id. \n \nThe power to appropriate money belongs to the legislature. Minn. Const. Art. XI § 1. Recognizing that it is possible \n\n2010 WL 545163 (Minn.)   Page 4 \nthat revenues may be insufficient to meet appropriations, the legislature enacted Minn. Stat. § 16A.152 (the “unal-\nlotment statute”) to empower the Governor to unallot appropriations. The statute does not allow the Governor to \nappropriate money, but merely enables the executive to utilize the legislatively delegated power to unallot to remedy \nbudget shortfalls. \n \nBecause the legislature only delegated an authority to reduce appropriations, and not its ultimate authority to appro-\npriate money, the Minnesota Court of Appeals determined that it was a constitutional delegation of authority from the \nlegislature to the Governor. See Rukavina v. Pawlenty, 684 N.W.2d 525 (Minn. App. 2004), (review denied Minn. \n2004) (“We conclude that Minn. Stat. § 16A.152, does not reflect *4 an unconstitutional delegation of legislative \npower, but only enables the executive to protect the state from financial crisis in a manner designated by the legisla-\nture.”) Amici acknowledge that the opinion of the Minnesota Court of Appeals in Rukavina is not binding on this \nCourt. \n \nHowever, for the reasons enunciated therein, amici ask that this Court find that the unallotment statute is a constitu-\ntional delegation of legislative power to the executive. \n \nII. The district court's ruling should be reversed as it violated separation of powers by unconstitutionally usurping the \nlegislature's express power to make and amend the laws. \n \nThe Minnesota Supreme Court has stated that “[a]gainst no one more than themselves should judges be meticulous in \nobservance of the boundaries of their constitutional function.” Anderson v. Consolidated Sch. Dist. No 144, 196 Minn. \n256, 259, 264 N.W. 784, 786 (1936). The district court recognized that its order implicated the separation of powers \ndoctrine, providing: \nIn an 1865 Minnesota Supreme Court case entitled In the Matter of the Application of the Senate, 10 Minn. 78 (1865), \nthe balance of power was *5 described as follows: ‘By the constitution, the power of the state government is divided \ninto three distinct departments, legislative, executive, and judicial. The powers and duties of each department are \ndistinctly defined. The departments are independent of each other to the extent, at least, that neither can exercise any of \nthe powers of the others not expressly provided for.’ Citing Minn. Const., art. III, § 1. This not only prevents an as-\nsumption by either department of power not properly belonging to it, but also prohibits the imposition, by one, of any \nduty upon either of the other not within the scope of its jurisdiction; and, ‘it is the duty of each to abstain from and to \noppose encroachments on either.’ Any departure from these important principles must be attended with evil. \n \n(Order, p. 7). \n \nThe district court failed to observe the boundaries of its Constitutional function. While purporting to enforce the \nseparation of powers doctrine, the district court trod heavily upon it by unconstitutionally usurping legislative powers. \n \nThe legislature, as the voice of the sovereign people, is “subject only to the limitations as the people have seen fit to \nincorporate in their Constitution, the legislature is vested with the sovereign power of the people themselves ..” Town \nof Bridgie v. Koochiching, 227 Minn. 320, 323, 35 N.W.2d 537, 539-40 (Minn. 1948) (citing *6State ex rel. Simpson \nv. City of Mankato, 117 Minn. 458, 463, 136 N.W. 264, 266 (1948)). \n \nIn exercising its check on legislative power, the judiciary is limited to determining only what the law is, not what it \nshould be. Estate of Karger, 253 Minn. 542, 93 N.W.2d 137 (1958) (noting that the legislature is to decide what the \nlaw ought to be; what the law is rests with the courts). The courts are “to determine the application of legislative action, \nnot to revise it.” Board of Education v. Public School Employees No. 63, 233 Minn. 144, 152, 45 N.W.2d 797 (1951). \n“Whatever our individual opinions may be as to the wisdom of the present law or the necessity for further legislation, \nour duty here is simply to apply the law objectively as we find it.” Id. \n \nIn 1939, the legislature exercised its constitutional power and enacted the “unallotment statute”, what is now Min-\n\n2010 WL 545163 (Minn.)   Page 5 \nnesota Statute § 16A.152 (2008). The statute provides in relevant part: \n \nSubd. 4. Reduction. \n(a) If the commissioner [of Minnesota Management and Budget] determines that probable receipts for the general fund \nwill be less than anticipated, and that the amount available for the remainder of the biennium will be less than needed, \nthe *7 commissioner shall, with the approval of the governor, and after consulting the Legislative Advisory Com-\nmission, reduce the amount in the budget reserve account as needed to balance expenditures with revenue. \n(b) An additional deficit shall, with the approval of the governor, and after consulting the legislative advisory com-\nmission, be made up by reducing unexpended allotments of any prior appropriation or transfer. Notwithstanding any \nother law to the contrary, the commissioner is empowered to defer or suspend prior statutorily created obligations \nwhich would prevent effecting such reductions. \n \nThe district court found that the unallotment statute was constitutional. (Order, p. 4). Having found that the unallot-\nment statute was a constitutional delegation of legislative authority, the district court's review was then limited to \nwhether the executive exceeded that legislatively delegated authority. The district court erred -in effectively amending \nthe unallotment statute to include requirements not contained therein - in reaching its conclusion. \n \nThe district court found that there was a “$4.847 billion budget deficit for the 2010/2011 biennium.” (Order, p. 4). It \nalso found that “[b]y exercising his unallotment authority to apply to reductions in revenues that were *8 determined \nby a forecast made before the budget had even been enacted and by not excluding reductions that were already known \nwhen the budget was enacted, the Governor crossed the line between legitimate exercise of his authority to unallot and \ninterference with the Legislative power to make laws.” (Order, p. 6, emphasis added). \n \nHaving found the statute constitutional, and that there was a deficit for the biennium, the district court held that the \nGovernor's action was unconstitutional. (Order, p. (6). To reach this holding, the court effectively amended the statute \nto specifically require when the anticipated shortfall can occur before exercise of the unallotment authority is proper. \n \nThis Court has written that rules of statutory construction “forbid adding words or meaning to a statute that were \nintentionally or inadvertently left out.” Genin v. 1996 Mercury Marquis, 622 N.W.2d 114, 117 (Minn. 201), see also \nPhelps v. Commonwealth Land Title Ins. Co., 537 N.W.2d 271, 274 (Minn. 1995) (noting that courts should not read \ninto statutes restrictions that the: legislature did not include). The unallotment statute reads in pertinent part “probable \nreceipts for the general fund will be less *9 than anticipated.” Minn. Stat. § 16A.152 Subd. 4(a) (2008). Instead, the \ndistrict court effectively amended the statute to provide that unallotment is appropriate only when “probable receipts \nfor the general fund will be less than anticipated after passage of the biennium budget.” \n \nIt is on the basis of its reading of the “revised statute” that the district court determined the Governor exceeded his \nauthority. The district court moved from determining what the law is, which is a constitutional exercise of its authority, \ninto determining what the law ought to be, which was an unconstitutional usurpation of legislative power. \n \nHad the legislature intended to restrict unallotment authority to anticipated shortfalls occurring only after passage of \nthe biennium budget, it could have so written. It did not. The legislature has amended the unallotment statute three out \nof the five legislative sessions since it was declared constitutional in Rukavina. It amended subdivision 2 in 2005 and \nagain in 2007. See 2005 Minn. Laws. Ch. 156, Art. 2, § 16; 2007 Minn. Laws. Ch. 146, Art. 1, § 1. Finally, it amended \nsubdivision 2 and inserted subdivision 8 in 2009. See 2009 Minn. Laws. Ch. 36, art. 2, *10 § 1; Ch. 86, art. 1, § 4; Ch. \n101, art. 2, § 49. At no time did the legislature amend the unallotment statute to restrict the exercise of the unallotment \nauthority to only circumstances wherein the anticipated shortfall in general fund receipts occurs after passage of the \nbiennium budget. Yet, the district court's order reads such words into the statute. Had the legislature intended to so \nrestrict the unallotment authority, it had ample opportunity and continues to have ample opportunity. Having chosen \nnot to so amend the statute, the legislature manifested its intent to delegate authority to the executive as written. \n \n\n2010 WL 545163 (Minn.)   Page 6 \nThe district court also effectively amends subdivision 4(b). In holding that the Governor unconstitutionally usurped \nthe legislative authority to make the laws, the court writes “[t]he Governor used unallotment rather than calling a \nspecial session of the legislature or vetoing the appropriations bill to balance the budget.” (Order, p. 6). The plain \nlanguage of the unallotment statute reads: “Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the commissioner is em-\npowered to defer or suspend prior statutorily created obligations.” Minn. Stat. § 16A.152 subd. 4 (b). Rather than \naccept the plain language of the *11 statute, the district court effectively amends it to read: “Notwithstanding any other \nlaw to the contrary, except the Governor's authority to call a special session or to veto legislation, which shall in all \ncases be utilized before exercising the authority granted herein, the commissioner is empowered to defer or suspend \nprior statutorily created obligations.” Once again, the district court extended its authority beyond determining what the \nlaw is to what the law should be. In doing so, the district court unconstitutionally usurped the legislative power to \nmake the laws. Had the legislature intended the statute to restrict the Governor's unallotment power as the district court \ninterprets it, the legislature could have written it that way. That it did not, does not give the district court license to do \nso. \n \nThis Court has written in regards to the legislature and the executive that, “[t]here is a wide field wherein their decision, \neven though wrong is final. The same is true of judges, the sum of whose errors will be kept somewhere near an \nirreducible minimum in proportion as they refrain from attempts to decide issues which constitutional and statutory \nlaw have committed to the legislative and *12 executive departments of government.” Lindquist v. Abbet, 196 Minn. \n233, 240, 265 N.W. 54, 57 (1936). The legislature had ample opportunity to amend the statute as the district court \nwould seek to have it amended. It did not. \n \nThe amici curiae support the Governor's execution of his unallotment authority. But amici acknowledge that there \nmay be an instance where the Governor exercises that authority in a manner inconsistent with their intent. In such a \ncircumstance, the amici would resort to restricting that action through the use of their legislative authority, rather than \nresort to the courts to exercise their legislative authority for them. In fact, within days of the Governor's May 2009 \nannouncement that he would unallot, a bill was introduced to repeal the Governor's unallotment power. H.F. 2395, \n2009 Leg., 86th Sess. (Minn. 2009). The introduction of this bill illustrates the legislature's recognition of its power to \nrestrict the delegated authority to the Governor. \n \nThe district court's ruling should be overturned as it unconstitutionally usurped the legislative authority to make and \namend the laws by effectively amending the unallotment statute to include requirements not placed in *13 it by the \nlegislature. It was apparently on the basis of this “revised statute” that the district court found that the Governor vi-\nolated the act. \n \nIII. Public policy supports the reversal of the district court's decision as the proper outcome of political disputes is not \nfor the courts to determine. \n \nThe district court should be reversed because public policy supports that political disputes between the legislature and \nthe executive be settled by the legislature and the executive, rather than the courts. The district court finds that the \ndiscussions between the legislature and the governor in determining priorities and establishing a balanced budget \n“were often rancorous and did not result in compromise legislation acceptable to both the legislative majority and the \ngovernor.” (Order, p. 5). However, just because; the legislature and the executive were unable to settle a political \ndispute on how best to balance the budget, does not mean the district court should make that determination for them. \n“The executive and legislative departments of government have, properly, an extensive field of action, wherein, if they \nerr, there results no justiciable question for court determination. It *14 is often a political issue, and if such it is, it is not \nfor the courts to settle it. An error in that field ought to be corrected by an appeal to the voters at the proper time.” \nKetterer v. Independent School Dist. No. 1, 248 Minn. 212, 221-222, 79 N.W.2d 428, 435-436 (Minn. 1948). Sound \npublic policy demands that wholly political disputes are best resolved between the executive and legislative branches; \nnot among the executive, legislative and judicial branches. \n \nAssuming arguendo that the governor did exceed the authority delegated to him by the legislature, there would be a \n\n2010 WL 545163 (Minn.)   Page 7 \njusticiable controversy for the court to review. But in the case at issue, we assert that the Governor did act within the \nscope of authority that the legislature granted to him. An affirmance of the district court's decision would leave the \ncourt as the final arbiter of every political dispute between the legislature and the executive -an outcome that does not \ncomport with sound public policy. \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nThe district court's ruling should be reversed. The unallotment statute is a constitutional delegation of *15 legislative \npower to the executive. In granting the temporary restraining order - ostensibly to preserve separation of powers - the \ndistrict court unconstitutionally usurped legislative authority to enact or amend legislation. Finally, public policy \nsupports reversing the district court's decision, as the dispute at issue is a wholly political dispute to be resolved be-\ntween the executive and legislative branches. \n \nDeanna BRAYTON, et al., Respondents, v.

STAT. \n§ 16A.152, subd. 4 (“the unallotment statute”). We respectfully submit, however, that the unallotment power autho-\nrized by the statute is consistent with the Minnesota Constitution's separation of powers. This Court has identified two \nseparation-of-powers constraints on statutes that confer discretion on the executive. Neither is violated here. \n \nFN1. Counsel certify that this brief was authored in whole by listed counsel and the amid curiae professors. \nNo person or entity made any monetary contribution to the preparation or submission of the brief. This brief \nis filed on behalf of Professors David Stras, Associate Professor of Law at the University of Minnesota, and \nRyan Scott, Associate Professor at Indiana University Maurer School of Law in Bloomington, Indiana, who \nwere granted leave to participate as amid by this Court's January 28, 2010, Order. It is also filed on behalf of \nProfessor Michael Stokes Paulsen, Distinguished University Chair and Professor at the University of St. \nThomas School of Law in Minneapolis if his pending motion to participate as amicus curiae is granted by the \nCourt. All three professors participated in the preparation of this brief. \n \nFirst, the legislature cannot delegate “purely legislative power” to the executive branch. Lee v. Delmont, 36 N.W.2d \n530, 538 (Minn. 1949). Courts around the country, including the United States Supreme Court, draw a distinction \nbetween the legislative power to make appropriations and the executive power to control the extent of spending \npursuant to an appropriation. Clinton . City of N.Y., 524 U.S. 417, 446 (1998) (discussing the President's “traditional \nauthority to decline to spend appropriated funds,” when authorized by Congress). No fewer than thirty-eight States \nexpressly empower their governors to spend less than the amounts appropriated in enacted budgets without legislative \napproval. See National Association of State Budget Officers, Badget Processes in the States 29 (2008). There can be \nno serious claim, therefore, that the unallotment statute delegates “purely legislative power.” \n \nSecond, the legislature must provide “a reasonably clear policy or standard to guide and control administrative of-\n\n2010 WL 545164 (Minn.)   Page 6 \nficers.” City of Richfield v. Local No. 1215, Int'l Ass'n of Fire Fighters, 276 N.W.2d 42, 45 (Minn. 1979); Anderson v. \nComnm'r of Highways, 126 N.W.2d 778, 780 (Minn. 1964) (recognizing that the “modern tendency is to be more \nliberal in permitting grants of discretion” to the executive branch under the separation of powers). The unallotment \nstatute more than satisfies that minimal requirement by (1) limiting the circumstances and scope of the unallotment \npower, (2) supplying guidelines for the priority of unallotments, (3) requiring the executive to consult with legislative \nrepresentatives, and (4) reserving to the legislature ultimate authority to prevent or override unallotment decisions. \n \nThe district court's contrary ruling, which faulted the executive for the “specific manner” in which the unallotments \nwere implemented (Order 6), is deeply flawed. The validity of a statute conferring discretion on the executive depends \non the “nature of the power” exercised, not “the manner of its exercise.” Lee, 36 N.W.2d at 539. The district court's \nnovel conclusion that the legislature's freedom to delegate to the executive is confined by the Minnesota Constitution \nto circumstances that were “unknown and unanticipated” when the law was enacted (Order 6) is flatly inconsistent \nwith this Court's decisions. And the district court's approach, which necessitates a case-by-case inquiry into the mo-\ntives and “manner” of every unallotment, would itself raise separation-of-powers concerns by routinely injecting the \ncourts into contentious budget negotiations and requiring the them to be the final arbiters of inherently political dis-\nputes. \n \nArgument \n \nI. The Unallotment Statute Does Not Violate the Separation of Powers. \n \nThe Minnesota Constitution divides the powers of state government into legislative, executive, and judicial depart-\nments, and provides that “[n]o person or persons belonging to or constituting one of these departments shall exercise \nany of the powers properly belonging to either of the others.” MINN. CONST. art. III, § 1. This constitutional feature \nis designed to “diffuse power the better to secure liberty.” Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635 \n(1952) (Jackson, J., concurring); accord Wulff v. Tax Court of Appeals, 288 N.W.2d 221, 223 (Minn. 1979) (“the basic \nprinciple remains; too much power in the hands of one governmental branch invites corruption and tyranny”). \n \nInterpreting that command, this Court has recognized two separation-of-powers limitations on executive actions taken \nunder statutes conferring discretion on the executive branch. First, the legislature cannot grant “purely legislative \npower” to the governor or any executive agency. Lee, 36 N.W.2d at 538. Second, under the Court's nondelegation \ncases, the legislature may not grant executive officers discretion in executing the law without “a reasonably clear \npolicy or standard to guide and control administrative officers.” City of Richfield, 276 N.W.2d at 45. \n \nThe unallotment statute does not violate either of those limitations. Reasonable minds may disagree, as a matter of \npublic policy, about the wisdom and proper limits of *4 the statutory power of unallotment. The governor's exercise of \nthat power in this case has touched off a heated partisan battle. But whatever the resolution of those disagreements, the \nauthority granted by the legislature, and exercised by the executive here, does not violate the Constitution. The power \nto decline to spend appropriated funds is essentially executive, not legislative. And the unallotment power granted by \nMINN. STAT. § 16A.152, subd. 4, contains limitations that satisfy the minimal requirement of a “reasonably clear \npolicy or standard” under the nondelegation doctrine. \n \nA. The Unallotment Power Is Not “Purely Legislative,” and Therefore May Be Constitutionally Assigned to the Ex-\necutive. \n \nDespite the absolute language of the Constitution's separation-of-powers clause, this Court has long recognized that \n“there has never been an absolute division of governmental functions in this country, nor was such even intended.” \nWulff, 288 N.W.2d at 223; see, e.g., State ex rel. Patterson v. Bates, 104 N.W. 709, 712 (Minn. 1905) (disclaiming the \n“unwarranted assumption that all the functions of government must necessarily be either executive, legislative, or \njudicial in their nature”). Instead, the Court has interpreted the separation requirement as prohibiting the legislature \n\n2010 WL 545164 (Minn.)   Page 7 \nfrom delegating “purely” or “exclusively” legislative power to the governor or any executive agency or official. Lee, \n36 N.W.2d at 538; Patterson, 104 N.W. at 712; cf ICC v. Goodrich Transit Co., 224 U.S. 194, 214 (1912) (“The \nCongress may not delegate its purely legislative power to a commission ... “). “Pure legislative power,” means “the \nauthority to make a complete law-complete as to the time it shall take effect and as to whom it shall apply-and to \ndetermine the expediency of its enactment.” Lee, 36 N.W.2d at 538. \n \n*5 The discretionary power to decline to spend appropriated funds, especially when specifically authorized by the \nlegislature, is not “pure legislative power.” To the contrary, it is the essentially executive power to “take care that the \nlaws be faithfully executed.” MINN. CONST. art V, § 3. The constitutional imperative to avoid indebtedness rein-\nforces that the executive, with the blessing of the legislature, may play a proper role in heading off a budget deficit. Id. \nart. XI, §§ 4-6. \n \n1. The legislature may constitutionally appropriate money for a specific purpose and allow the executive to decline to \nspend the money. \n \nThere is no dispute that making appropriations is a purely legislative function. See MINN. CONST. art. XI, § 1 \n(providing that appropriations[s]” be made “by law”); Inter Faculty Org. v. Carlson, 478 N.W.2d 192, 194 (Minn. \n1991) (governor's item veto power over appropriations is “an exception” to the legislature's power). But nothing about \nthe legislature's exclusive power over appropriations precludes the legislature from authorizing the executive branch \nto spend less than the full amount of appropriated funds. To the contrary, the Supreme Court has recognized that the \nexecutive branch holds a “traditional authority to decline to spend appropriated funds” if authorized by the legislature, \ndating back to the first Congress in 1789. Clinton, 524 U.S. at 446 (discussing early appropriations laws that afforded \nthe President discretion to spend less than the full amount, or nothing at all); id. at 466-67 (Scalia, J., dissenting) \n(similar appropriations enacted during the early Eighteenth Century, Civil War, and Great Depression); id. at 488-89 \n(Breyer, J., dissenting) (same). Based on that long history, there is no doubt that the *6 legislature may constitutionally \nappropriate money for a specific purpose, but grant the executive discretion to decline to spend the money. See id. at \n446. \n \nMinnesota law reflects that understanding. It defines an “appropriation” as an “authorization by law to expend or \nencumber an amount in the treasury” for a particular purpose. See MINN. STAT. § 16A.11, subd. 4 (emphasis added). \nTellingly, it expressly contemplates that executive agencies may have “unused appropriations,” MINN. STAT. § \n16A.28, and empowers the commissioner to control whether monies not spent by the close of a biennium's first fiscal \nyear carry forward into the next, id. § 16A.28, subd. 2-4. Indeed, although the legislature could mandate full ex-\npenditure of an appropriation, courts around the country recognize a default rule that an appropriation “is not a \nmandate to spend,” but instead is “an authorization given by the legislature” to spend no more than a “stated sum for \nspecified purposes.” Island Count Comm, on Assessment Ratios v. Dept of Revenue, 500 P.2d 756, 763 (Wash. 1972); \nsee New England Div. of the Am. Cancer Soc't v. Comm'r of Admin., 769 N.E.2d 1248, 1256 (Mass. 2002) (defining \n“appropriation” as the “set[ing] apart from the public revenue a certain sum of money for a specified object, in such \nmanner that the executive officers of the government are authorized to use that money, and no more, for that object and \nfor no other”) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).[FN2] \n \nFN2. See also Rios v. Symington, 833 P.2d 20, 24 (Ariz. 1992); Colorado Gen. Assembly v. Lamm, 700 P.2d \n508, 520 (Colo. 1985) (en bane); State ex rel. Norfolk Beet-Sugar Co. v. Moore, 69 N.W. 373, 376 (Neb. \n1896); cf. Detroit City Council v. Mayor of Detroit, 537 N.W.2d 177, 182 (Mich. 1995) (“an appropriation is \nnot a mandate to spend”). \n \n*7 The longstanding recognition that the executive may presumptively decline to spend appropriated funds is \ngrounded in a fundamental distinction between appropriations and spending. Whereas the activity of setting appro-\npriations is a legislative task, “the activity of spending money is essentially an executive task.” Op. of the Justices to \nthe Senate, 376 N.E.2d 1217, 1222 (Mass. 1978); see also, e.g., Common Cause of Pa. v. Commonwealth, 668 A.2d \n190, 205-06 (Pa. 1995); Hunter v. State, 865 A.2d 381, 390 (Vt. 2004). The spending power derives from the execu-\n\n2010 WL 545164 (Minn.)   Page 8 \ntive's constitutionally-exclusive power and duty to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” MINN. CONST. \nart. V, § 3; see also U.S. CONST. art. II, § 3. Thus, when the legislature attempts to directly control spending beyond \nthe appropriations process, it risks unconstitutionally intruding on the powers of the executive branch.[FN3] \n \nFN3. See, e.g., Advisory Op. in re Separation of Powers, 295 S.E.2d 589, 594 (N.C. 1982) (invalidating \nstatute empowering legislative commission to control Governor's budget transfers because it encroached on \nthe executive's authority to “administer the budget”); Anderson v. Lamm, 579 P.2d 620, 623 (Colo. 1978) \n(invalidating statute conditioning spending pursuant to appropriation on approval from the legislature's \nbudget committee); State ex rel. Schneider v. Bennett, 547 P.2d 786, 797 (Kan. 1976) (legislative finance \ncommittee could not exercise continuing oversight of executive's spending pursuant to appropriations). \n \nThere are sound reasons why the power to spend is entrusted to the executive. Faithfully executing the laws neces-\nsarily entails “the exercise of judgment and discretion,” and the executive is “not obliged to spend [appropriated] \nmoney foolishly or needlessly.” Op. of the Justices, 376 N.E.2d at 1222-23. A mild winter might make it unnecessary \nto spend the full amount appropriated for snow removal. Cost savings might make it possible to spend less than the full \namount appropriated for a highway project. No *8 separation-of-powers principle prevents the executive from res-\nponding to those situations by declining to spend the full amount of every appropriation. Rios, 833 P.2d at 29 (“the \nGovernor must manage the government in a fiscally responsible fashion and is not required, under all circumstances, \nto dispose of all appropriated money before the end of the fiscal year”).[FN4] \n \nFN4. See also, e., Common Cause of Pa., 668 A.2d at 206 (“Once taxes have been levied and appropriation \nmade, the legislative prerogative ends and the executive responsibility begins ....”) (quoting Alexander v. \nState, 441 So. 2d 1329, 1341 (Miss. 1983)); State ex rel. McLeod v. Mclnnis, 295 S.E.2d 633, 637 (1982) \n(“[A]dministration of appropriations .. is a function of the executive department.”); Comci'ns workers of Am., \nAFL CIO v. Florio, 617 A.2d 223, 234 (N.J. 1992) (“[P]laintiffs fail to recognize the distinction between the \npower to appropriate or not appropriate funds, a legislative function, and the power to expend the appro-\npriated funds, an executive function.”). \n \nThe decision in Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714 (1986), confirms that the power to reduce spending to avoid a budget \ndeficit, within parameters set by the legislature, is essentially executive in nature. Bowsher involved a challenge to a \nfederal statute that mandated, upon a federal budget deficit exceeding a specified amount, immediate spending cuts by \nformula. Id. at 717-18. The statute provided that the Comptroller General, a legislative officer, determine the required \n“program-by-program” spending cuts under the statute. Id. at 732. The Court held that, by granting a legislative \nofficial “the ultimate authority to determine the budget cuts to be made” pursuant to the statute, the Act impermissibly \nencroached on the President's power to execute the laws. Id. at 733-34. Reducing spending according to standards set \nby Congress was executive action, the Court held, because it executes the law aimed at reducing the deficit. Id. at \n732-33 (“[W]e view these functions as plainly entailing execution of the law in constitutional terms.”). \n \n*9 2. The Minnesota Constitution s prohibition against public debt reinforces that the executive may constitutionally \ndecline to spend. \n \nThe Minnesota Constitution's imperative to avoid indebtedness reinforces the conclusion that the legislature is free to \nassign the executive a role in averting a budget and reserve deficit. Article XI of the Minnesota Constitution provides \nthat the State may not take on public debt, except for limited purposes, such as the acquisition and improvement of \nland and buildings. MINN. CONST. art. XI, §§ 4-5. It further provides that the State cannot issue short-term certifi-\ncates of indebtedness from a fund beyond the amount of monies that will be credited to the fund during the biennium. \nId. art. XI, § 6. Read together, those provisions prohibit the State from spending into indebtedness, save for specified \nlong-term projects. \n \nWhile this prohibition against public debt guides the legislature as it sets appropriations, it has particular importance \n\n2010 WL 545164 (Minn.)   Page 9 \nfor the executive branch. The executive branch is both responsible for, and “the only branch capable of, having de-\ntailed and contemporaneous knowledge regarding spending decisions.” Hunter, 865 A.2d at 390 (quoting Op. of the \nJustices, 376 N.E.2d at 1223). Thus, even though the executive is constitutionally bound “to apply his full energy and \nresources, in the exercise of his best judgment and ability, to ensure that the intended goals of legislation are effec-\ntuated,” Op. of the Justices, 376 N.E.2d at 1221, the executive is also bound not to spend more than the State has in \nreserves and revenues. Since the executive branch would violate the Constitution if its spending to the full amount of \nappropriations would lead to indebtedness, the executive branch presumptively has discretion to avoid that violation \nby *10 spending less than appropriated. See County of Cabarrus v. Tolson, 610 S.E.2d 443, 4.46 (N.C. Ct. App. 2005) \n(“Implicit in the duty to prevent deficits is the ability of the Governor to affect the budget he must administer.”). \n \n3. The unallotment statute does not assign “purely legislative” power. \n \nIn light of the long tradition of executive discretion to decline to spend appropriated funds, as well as the Minnesota \nConstitution's prohibition on public debt, the unallotment statute does not assign “purely legislative” power to the \nexecutive. It does not empower the executive to make a “complete law.” Lee, 36 N.W. at 538. Instead, under specified \ncircumstances, the statute directs the commissioner to tap the budget reserve “to balance expenditures with revenue” \nand, if any “additional deficit” remains, to “ma[k]e up” that amount “by reducing unexpended allotments of any prior \nappropriation or transfer.” MINN. STAT. § 16A.152, subd, 4(a)-(b). Unallotment does not disturb the legislature's \nappropriations, which continue to specify the maximum amount and sole purposes for which state funds may be spent. \nNor does unallotment alter the executive's constitutional obligation to take care, to the best of his ability, that the laws \nbe faithfully executed. MINN. CONST. art. V, § 3. If the budget forecast changes, and additional revenues reduce or \neliminate the deficit, the executive could resume spending up to the full amount of the legislature's appropriations. \nThus, the statute authorizes the commissioner to perform a fundamentally executive function, administering the \nbudget to ensure that expenditures do not outpace revenues. \n \nThe plaintiffs contend that unallotment grants the executive “the power to rewrite appropriations,” Mem. in Support of \nPlaintiffs” Motion for TRO at 25 (Nov. 6, 2009); see *11 id. at 27 (“power to modify or annul a duly enacted law”), \nand thereby to “ ‘totally negate a legislative policy that lies at the core of the legislative function,’ ” id. at 30 (quoting \nHunter, 805 A.2d at 390). They describe the unallotment power as equivalent to a veto, and therefore incompatible \nwith the Constitution's grant to the executive of line-item veto power for appropriations. Id. at 24-25. By treating the \ndiscretion to decline to spend funds as purely legislative power, which can never be delegated, the plaintiffs would \nstrip the executive of the essential ability to avoid unnecessary, wasteful, or irresponsible expenditures, no matter how \ncarefully the legislature limited the executive's discretion. \n \nIn any event, the plaintiffs' description of the unallotment power is inaccurate. An appropriation is an “authorization” \nto spend, not a command, MINN. STAT. § 16A.011, subd. 4, and unallotment does not “rewrite” or “veto” anything. \nFollowing unallotment, the underlying appropriation remains good law, and retains its full legal effect as an “autho-\nriz[ation] to use that money, and no more, for that object and for no other.” New England Div. of the Am. Cancer Soc]y, \n769 N.E.2d at 1256; see MINN. STAT. § 16A.152, subd. 4(b). Unallotment, when expressly permitted by statute, is \nexecutive action because it executes the statute's instruction to avoid a budget deficit. Bowsher, 478 U.S. at 733-35 \n(holding that, when a statute authorizes spending cuts to avoid a budget deficit, “the ultimate authority to determine \nthe budget cuts to be made” pursuant to the statute is executive power). Finally, the legislature remains free to exclude \nany appropriation from unallotment and to enact a statute overriding any unallotment, preserving the legislature's final \nsay on the appropriation. See infra at 16-17. \n \n*12 That the unallotment power is executive in nature is confirmed by the fact that in at least thirty-eight States, the \ngovernor is expressly authorized to spend less than the amount appropriated in enacted budgets without legislative \napproval. See National Association of State Budget Officers, Budget Processes in the States 29 (2008). A power \nwielded by more than three-fourths of the nation's governors can hardly be characterized as “purely legislative.” As \nthe Court of Appeals recognized in rejecting an earlier separation-of-powers challenge to the statute, unallotment does \nnot affect “the legislature's ultimate authority to appropriate money, but merely enables the executive to deal with an \n\n2010 WL 545164 (Minn.)   Page 10 \nanticipated budget shortfall before it occurs.” Rukavina v. Pawlenty, 684 N.W.2d 525, 535 (Minn. Ct. App. 2004). \n \nB. The Unallotment Statute Does Not Unconstitutionally Delegate Excessive Legislative Power to the Executive \nBranch. \n \nSeparately, this Court has recognized that, according to the separation of powers, the legislature must provide some \n“minimum standards” to guide executive officials “for a delegation of legislative power to receive constitutional \nprotection.” City of Richfield, 276 N.W.2d at 45. But the nondelegation standard is extremely permissive, Anderson, \n126 N.W.2d at 780-81; see also Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass'ns, 531 U.S. 457, 474-75 (2001), reflecting a recogni-\ntion that “legislation must often be adapted to complex conditions,” Lee, 36 N.W.2d at 538-39. Under that standard, \nthe unallotment statute falls comfortably within the boundaries of the nondelegation doctrine. It limits the circums-\ntances and scope of the unallotment power, supplies guidelines for the priority of unallotnents, compels the executive \nto consult with the legislature, and preserves the legislature's ultimate authority to prevent or override unallotments. \n \n*13 1. Delegation of legislative power pursuant to standards is constitutional. \n \nA delegation is constitutionally permissible so long as the legislature supplies “a reasonably clear policy or standard of \naction which controls and guides the administrative officers in ascertaining the operative facts to which the law ap-\nplies.” Lee, 36 N.W.2d at 538. In announcing that requirement, this Court emphasized that “[t]he policy of the law and \nthe standard of action to guide the administrative agencies may be laid down in very broad and general terms.” Id. at \n538-39. In subsequent years, the Court has elaborated on Lee's standard in light of the “modern tendency ... to be more \nliberal in permitting grants of discretion to administrative officers in order to facilitate the administration of laws as the \ncomplexity of economic and governmental conditions increase.” Anderson, 126 N.W.2d at 780-81. This Court has \nupheld, as constitutionally sufficient, broad instructions to adopt fire-hazard rules “consistent with nationally recog-\nnized good practice” that “safeguard[]” life and property “to a reasonable degree,” City of Minneapolis v. Krebes, 226 \nN.W.2d 617, 619 (Minn. 1975); and to prohibit “unprofessional conduct,” Reyburn v. Minn. State Bd. of Optomety, 78 \nN.W.2d 351, 354-56 (Minn. 1956). On three occasions, it has indicated that a legislative instruction to regulate a \ncomplex area “in the public interest” is constitutionally sufficient. Minn. Energy & Econ. Dev. Auth. v. Printy, 351 \nN.W.2d at 319, 349 n.10 (Minn. 1984); Lee, 36 N.W.2d at 539 n.ll; State e rel. Interstate Air Parts, Inc. v Minneap-\nolis-St. Pazl Metro. Airports Comm'n, 25 N.W.2d 718, 727-28 (Minn. 1947). Indeed, so far as our research discloses, \nthis Court has never once invalidated a delegation of legislative power to the executive branch for lack of a reasonably \nclear policy or standard. Printy, 351 N.W.2d at 350 n.1l. \n \n*14 This Court's approach to nondelegation is fully consistent with the United States Supreme Court's case law \nupholding expansive delegations of power to federal agencies. See, e.g., N.Y. Cent. Sec. Cotp. v. U.S., 287 U.S. 12, \n24-25 (1932) (power to approve railroad consolidations in the “public interest”); Nat'l Broad. Co. v. U.S., 319 U.S. \n190, 225-26 (1943) (power to regulate airwaves in the “public interest, convenience [and] necessity”); Lichter v. U.S., \n334 U.S. 742, 785-87 (1948) (power to recoup “excessive profits” from war contractors). Summarizing its cases, the \nCourt has explained that it “almost never fe[els] qualified to second-guess Congress regarding the permissible degree \nof policy judgment that can be left to those executing or applying the law.” Am. Tmwcking Ass'ns, 531 U.S. at 474-75 \n(internal quotation marks omitted). The United States Supreme Court has not struck down a statute on nondelegation \ngrounds since 1935. Id. \n \nNondelegation cases carve out a narrow role for courts in policing the degree of discretion conferred upon the ex-\necutive branch. E.g., Wayman v. Southard, 23 U.S. (10 Wheat.) 1, 46 (1825) (Marshall, C.J.) (“the precise boundary” \nbetween a permissible and impermissible delegation “is a subject of delicate and difficult inquiry, into which a court \nwill not enter unnecessarily”). That judicial self-restraint reflects important concerns about the competence of courts \nto determine which branch is best suited to make intricate policy judgments in complex financial and regulatory fields. \nAnderson, 126 N.W.2d at 780-81. As one scholar has explained, an aggressive “judicial enforcement of the [nonde-\nlegation] doctrine would produce ad hoc, highly discretionary rulings” that “suffer from the appearance, and perhaps \nthe reality, of judicial hostility to the particular *15 program at issue.” Cass R. Sunstein, Nondelegation Canons, 67 U. \n\n2010 WL 545164 (Minn.)   Page 11 \nCHI. L. REV. 315, 327 (2000). \n \n2. Because the delegation of power under the unallotment statute is constrained in several important ways, it is well \nwithin the legislature's constitutional power to delegate. \n \nUnder this Court's permissive nondelegation standard, the unallotment power conferred by the legislature is consti-\ntutional. Although § 16A.152, subd. 4, grants the executive discretion over spending decisions when the State faces a \nbudget shortfall, the statute limits the executive's unallotment authority in four significant ways. These constraints \nbring the unallotment power well within the expansive bounds of the legislature's constitutional power to delegate. \n \nFirst, the statute limits the circumstances and scope of the unallotment power, preventing the commissioner from \nreducing allotments at will. Authority to reduce allotments is not triggered unless “the commissioner determines that \nprobable receipts for the general fund will be less than anticipated, and that the amount available for the remainder of \nthe biennium will be less than needed.” MINN. STAT. § 16A.152, subd. 4(a)-4(b). Even then, the commissioner must \nfully exhaust the budget reserve account before resorting to unallotment. Id. In addition, once triggered, the power to \nreduce allotments is limited in scope to the amount “needed to balance expenditures with revenue” and to “ma [k]e up” \nany “additional deficit.” Id. subd. 4(b). The executive therefore cannot reduce allotments beyond the level necessary to \nprevent a budget deficit. Hence, the unallotment statute describes “operative facts” and “takes effect upon these facts \nby *16 virtue of its own terms, and not according to the whim or caprice of the administrative officers.” Lee, 36 \nN.W.2d at 538-39. \n \nSecond, the legislature has provided guidance concerning the purpose and priorHiy of unallotments. The statute \nprioritizes “saving[s]” within departments, directing that the commissioner “shall reduce allotments to an agency by \nthe amount of any saving that can be made over previous spending plans through a reduction in prices or other cause.” \nMINN. STAT. § 16A.152, subd. 4(e). It also provides that the commissioner “may consider other sources of revenue \navailable to recipients of state appropriations” (for example, tuition revenues available to state universities) and “may \napply allotment reductions based on” that information. Id. subd. 4(d). A statute can satisfy the requirement of a rea-\nsonably clear policy or standard by “provid[ing] guidelines” to executive officials “about the factors to consider in \ncoming to their decisions.” No Power Line, Inc. v. Min. Envtl. Quality Council, 262 N.W.2d 312, 330 (Minn. 1977); \nsee State v. King, 257 N.W.2d 693, 697 (Minn. 1977). \n \nThird, the statute ensures actual guidance by the legislature every time the governor invokes the unallotment power. \nBefore tapping the budget reserve and engaging in unallotment, the governor must first “consult?? the Legislative \nAdvisory Commission.” MINN. STAT. § 16A.152, subd. 4(a)-(b). That body, composed of key legislative leaders, see \nid. § 3.30, subd. 2, thus plays a necessary consultative role whenever the executive makes judgments concerning the \npriorities of unallotment. The statute also compels the executive branch to provide prompt notice of any reduction to \nfour different legislative committees. Id. § 16A.152, subd. 6. “[C]lose legislative monitoring of [executive] *17 op-\nerations” through planning and reporting requirements are hallmarks of permissible delegation because they ensure \nthat the legislature retains a degree of influence over the outcome, Printy, 351 N.W.2d at 351. \n \nFourth, the statute permits the legislature to prevent or override the governor's unallotment decisions. The legislature \nretains, and has repeatedly exercised, the power to exempt any individual appropriations it wishes from unallotment. \nSee, e.g., MINN. STAT. § 477A.011, subd. 36(y) (increasing the city aid base, and providing that “[t]he payment \nunder this paragraph is not subject to ... any future unallotment of the city aid under section 16A.152”); id. subd. 36(z) \n(same). In the past, the legislature has not hesitated to exclude even whole categories of appropriations from unal-\nlotment. Act of Feb. 13, 1981, ch. 1, § 2 (repealed) (removing the authority to reduce allotments of aid to school \ndistricts); see Senate Counsel, Legislative Histoy of Unallotment Power 4-5 (2009). Indeed, the legislature presently \nexempts entire funds from the governor's unallotment power. See MINN. STAT. § 16B.85, subd. 2(e) (risk man-\nagement fund “is exempt from the provisions of section 16A.152, subdivision 4”). And, of course, the legislature \nalways retains the power to enact new legislation that reshapes the budget in the manner of its choosing. See id. § \n41A.09, subd. 3a(h) (directing the commissioner to “reimburse ethanol producers for any deficiency in payments \n\n2010 WL 545164 (Minn.)   Page 12 \n[during certain time periods] because of unallotment”). The statutory scheme therefore reserves to the legislature, not \nthe governor, ultimate authority over spending priorities. \n \nFor those reasons, the court of appeals was correct in concluding that the unallotment power does not offend the state \nconstitution. As Judge Stoneburner *18 observed, the statute “does not reflect an unconstitutional delegation of leg-\nislative power,” but instead “enables the executive to protect the state from financial crisis in a manner designated by \nthe legislature.” Rikavina, 684 N.W.2d at 535 (emphasis added). \n \n3. Foreign decisions reinforce the constitutionality of unallotment in Minnesota. \n \nThe decisions of other state courts reinforce that the unallotment statute does not impermissibly delegate legislative \npower to the executive branch. In New England Div. of the Am. Cancer Soc'y v. Comm'r of Administration, 769 N.E.2d \n1248 (Mass. 2002), the court considered a challenge to a statute that directed an executive officer, whenever “available \nrevenues as determined by him from time to time during any fiscal year” would be “insufficient to meet all of the \nexpenditures authorized to be made from any fund,” to “immediately notify” key legislative committees and to “re-\nduce allotments ... by a total amount equal to such deficiency.” Id. at 1250. The court unanimously concluded that the \ngovernor's power was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. Id. at 1257. \n \nThe court stressed (1) that the unallotment power was confined to the amount of the revenue deficiency, (2) that the \ngovernor could reduce “only the allotment” while “the underlying appropriation remains fully in force,” (3) that the \nstatutory scheme requited immediate notice to the legislature whenever the power is invoked, (4) that the legislature \nretained “full authority” ex ante to attach conditions to individual appropriations “exempting the funds in question \nfrom allotment reductions,” (5) that the legislature retained full authority expost to balance the budget through new \nlegislation, and (6) the *19 constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed obligated the governor \n“to ensure that the intended goals of [affected] legislation are effectuated.” Id. \n \nThe same features are present under the Minnesota unallotment statute.[FN5] Indeed, the Minnesota statute grants the \ngovernor less discretion, since it supplies guidelines for setting unallotment priorities, and it compels the governor to \nconsult with the legislature during the process. \n \nFN5. See MINN. STAT. § 16A.152, subd. 4(b) (amount of unallotment limited to size of deficit); id. § \n16A.152, subd. 4(a)-(b) (no effect on underlying appropriations); id. § 16A.152, subd. 6 (notice to legislative \ncommittees); id. § 477A.011, subd. 36(y), (z) (exempting individual appropriations); id. § 41A.09, subd. 3a(h) \n(directing reimbursement of previously unalloted funds); MINN. CONST. art. V, § 3 (governor's duty to \n“take care that the laws be faithfully executed”). \n \nAt least seven other state supreme courts have upheld unallotment statutes, with widely varying triggers and limita-\ntions, against nondelegation challenges. See Legislative Research Comm'n ex rel. Prather v. Brown, 664 S.W.2d 907, \n925-26 (Ky. 1984);Judy v. Schaefer, 627 A.2d 1039, 1040,1052 (Md. 1993); Folsonm v. Wynn, 631 So. 2d 890, \n894-95 (Ala. 1993); N.D. Council of Sch. Adm'rs. v. Sinner, 458 N.W.2d 280, 286 (N.D. 1990); Hunter v. State, 865 \nA.2d 381, 395 (Vt. 2004); Univ. of Conn. Chapter of AAUP v. Governor, 512 A.2d 152, 158-59 (Conn. 1986); State ex \nrel. Schneider v. Bennett, 564 P.2d 1281, 1290 (Kan. 1977). \n \nNeither of the decisions relied upon by plaintiffs compel a different result here. See Meml. in Support of Plaintiffs' \nMotion for Temp. Restraining Order, at 28-29 (Nov. 6, 2009). In State v. Fairbanks North Star Borogh, 736 P.2d 1140 \n(Alaska 1987) (per curiam), the court struck down an unallotment statute that afforded the governor a “sweeping \npower over the entire budget with no guidance or limitation,” emphasizing that the *20 legislature “has articulated no \nprinciples, intelligible or otherwise, to guide the executive.” Id. at 1142-43. Once triggered by a budget deficit, the \nstatutory power to reduce allotments was unlimited; nothing in the statute compelled the governor to “limit his cuts to \nthe extent of the shortfall.” Id. at 1143. But the “[m]ost importantly” factor, according to the court, was the fact that \n\n2010 WL 545164 (Minn.)   Page 13 \n“the executive is provided with no policy guidance as to how the cuts should be distributed.” Id. \n \nThose problems are not present here. Section § 16A.152, subd. 4(b) expressly limits the governor's unallotment au-\nthority to the extent of the shortfall (to ‘ma[k]e up” any “additional deficit”). It also provides intelligible guidance to \nthe executive in two ways: (1) in the statute itself, by articulating guidelines for setting unallotment priorities (“sav-\ning[s]” in agency budgets, “all sources of revenue available” to affected departments), MINN. STAT. § 16A.152, subd. \n4(d)-(e); and (2) by directly involving the legislature in the decisionmaling process through consultation with the \nLegislative Advisory Commission, id. subd. 4(a)-(b). Those provisions of the Minnesota statute fully address the \n“most important” flaws in the Alaska statute. \n \nIn Chies v, Children A, B, C, D, E, and F, 589 So.2d 260 (Fla. 1991), the court struck down an even more expansive \ndelegation of authority to the executive. That case involved an executive commission with “broad discretionary au-\nthority to reapportion the state budget” under a statute that authorized the commission to directly “reduce all approved \nstate agency budget and releases” to prevent a deficit. Id. at 263 (emphasis in original). The court stressed that the \nstatute granted the executive branch “total discretion” to reduce appropriations, directly altering the state budget, and \nnot merely to *21 decline to spend appropriated funds. Id. at 265 (“We construe the power granted in [the statute] as \nprecisely the power to appropriate.”). Under the Florida constitution's strict nondelegation standard, the statute was \ninvalid because it did not contain any guidelines that could be “directly followed in the event of a budget shortfall” by \nspecifying “whichh budgeting priorities to maintain or to cut from the original appropriation.” Id. at 267-68 & n.9 \n(emphasis in original). \n \nThe Minnesota unallotment statute is substantially more limited. It grants the executive only the authority to decline to \nspend appropriated funds, not the power to alter appropriations set out in the legislature's budget, which remains in \nforce. See Folsom, 631 So. 2d at 894 (distinguishing Chiks on the ground that the Florida statute granted “absolute \ndiscretion to reduce and even eliminate all or part of the appropriations to state agencies”). It also provides guidance \nconcerning factors to consider in setting unallotnent priorities, and preserves a direct consultative role for the legis-\nlature whenever the power is triggered. \n \nIn any event, the Chiles court's nondelegation holding is inapposite because it rests on a fundamentally different legal \nstandard. Florida courts have adopted a notoriously restrictive nondelegation standard. Jim Rossi, Institutional Design \nand the Lingering Legacy, of Antifederalist Separation of Power Ideals in the States, 52 VAND. L. REV. 1167, \n1195-1200 (1999) (contrasting Florida's “strong” nondelegation doctrine, based on a “somewhat formalistic inter-\npretation of Florida's strict separation of powers clause,” with the “moderate” nondelegation approach of states like \nMinnesota). Minnesota's nondelegation decisions, which require only “a reasonably clear policy or standard of *22 \naction” and permit the legislature to use “very broad and general terms,” Lee, 36 N.W.2d at 538-39, cannot be re-\nconciled with a requirement of “clearly established” guidelines that “can be directly followed” and specify “which \nbudgeting priorities to maintain or to cut,” Chiles, 589 So. 2d at 267-68.[FN6] \n \nFN6. In addition, the Chiles court's approach is inconsistent with this Court's refusal to “judge the wisdom” \nof budget decisions, Johnson v. Carlson, 507 N.W.2d 232, 235 (Minn. 1993), as even the U.S. Department of \nJustice has identified Chikes as a case “in which courts have injected themselves into the state budget \nprocess.” Statement of Deputy Atty. Gen. Walter Dellinger, 19 U.S. Op. O.L.C. 8 (1995). \n \nIn sum, under this Court's “liberal” nondelegation standard, Anderson, 126 N.W.2d at 780, the present unallotment \nstatute readily-passes constitutional muster. \n \nII. The District Court Applied An Incorrect and Unworkable Separation-of-Powers Standard. \n \nThe district court not only reached the wrong result, but announced a deeply flawed constitutional standard that creates \nits own separation-of-powers problems by plunging the courts into every budget battle involving the unallotment \n\n2010 WL 545164 (Minn.)   Page 14 \npower. \n \nA. The District Court Wrongly Focused on the Manner of Exercise of Unallotment Authority, Rather Than the Nature \nof That Power. \n \nThe district court wrongly focused its constitutional inquiry on the “specific manner in which the Governor exercised \nhis unallotment authority.” Order 4; see id. 10 (‘The Court's decision was based on the way [the Governor] unalloted, \nnot what he unalloted.”). The district court apparently accepted that the executive branch had acted within the bounds \nof the unallotment statute. Nonetheless, the court held these particular unallotments unconstitutional. In the court's \nview, the statute authorizes some unallotments that are constitutional and others that are not. That is incorrect. \n \n*23 Whether an executive officer's action taken pursuant to a statute violates the separation of powers depends on “the \nnature of the power, and not the liability of its abuse or the manner of its exercise.” Lee, 36 N.W.2d at 539.[FN7] Thus, \nthe correct constitutional inquiry asks whether the nature of the unallotment power authorized by the statute is con-\nsistent with the separation of powers. It is a categorical, not case-specific, inquiry. If the unallotment statute is con-\nstitutional, as the court of appeals concluded, Rukavina, 684 N.W.2d at 535, and as demonstrated above, then any \nexercise of the statute consistent with the its terms is likewise constitutional. Lee, 36 N.W.2d at 539. Accordingly, the \ndistrict court's conclusion that the unallotment statute is constitutional (Order 4), should have ended its constitutional \ninquiry. \n \nFN7. The unallotment statute's constitutionality should not be judged against theoretical ways in which it \ncould be abused. Lee, 36 N.W.2d at 538. For example, plaintiffs raise the specter of the governor reducing \nallotments for projects that the legislature sought to fund fully by overriding a prior line-item veto of those \nprojects. Br. 24-25. There is no indication that any governor-in Minnesota or anywhere else-has actually used \nthe unallotment power in that fashion. Striking down the unallotment statute to prevent that theoretical pos-\nsibility would conflict both with Lee's focus on the “nature of the power,” and with the presumption that the \nexecutive will “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” See MINN. CONST. art. V, § 3. \n \nB. The District Court's Case-by-Case Test Is Unworkable and Without Constitutional Foundation. \n \nInstead, the district court fashioned a test that calls for a case-by-case determination of whether any given exercise of \nthe unallotment statute “crossed the line” of constitutionality. Order 6. That approach raises its own separa-\ntion-of-powers *24 concerns by making the courts final arbiters of inherently political disputes whenever the unal-\nlotment power is exercised. \n \nAlthough opaque, the district court's test apparently requires courts to scrutinize the executive and legislative \nbranches' respective motives and negotiating tactics, in order to decide which bears more fault for a particular budget \nimpasse. Thus, in explaining how the governor “crossed the line,” the court noted that the governor did not veto \nvarious appropriation bills, exercised a line-item veto over just one provision in the Health and Human Services bill, \nand did not call the legislature into a special session. See Order 5-6. The court focused on the governor's knowledge \nregarding projected revenues at the time he signed appropriation bills. Id. And the court observed that the “governor \nvetoed” a revenue bill that “would have balanced the budget.” Order 6. \n \nNeedless to say, the governor has full discretion over whether to sign a given bill, exercise particular vetoes, or call the \nlegislature into special session. See, e.g., State ex rel. Birkeland v. Christianson, 229 N.W. 313, 314 (Minn. 1930) \n(“Neither department can control, coerce, or restrain the action or nonaction of either of the others in the exercise of \nany official power or duty conferred by the Constitution, or by valid law, involving the exercise of discretion.”); State \nex rel. Burnquist v. Distict Court, 168 N.W. 634, 636 (Minn. 1918) (same). This Court has made clear that it has no \nappetite to assign blame or second-guess motives in political fights between coordinate branches of government. \nWhen reviewing disputes over the exercise of line-item vetoes, the Court has stressed that it has no role in judging “the \n\n2010 WL 545164 (Minn.)   Page 15 \nwisdom of a veto, or the motives behind it.” Johnson, 507 N.W.2d at 235; see also Inter Faculty Org., 478 N.W.2d at \n194 (stating that “it is not [the *25 Court's] role to comment on the wisdom of either the appropriations or the exercise \nof the item veto”); cf. Starkweather v. Blair, 71 N.W.2d 869, 875-76 (Minn. 1955) (“motives” of the political branches \nare not “the proper subject of judicial inquiry”). For the same reasons, the unallotments at issue here should not rise or \nfall based on a court's view of their prudence, or of the executive or legislative branches' behavior in the underlying \ndispute. \n \nC. There Is No Constitutional Foundation for a Requirement that Deficits Be “Unknown and Unanticipated.” \n \nAccording to the district court, the Constitution permits the legislature to delegate unallotment power only to the \nextent necessary to address budget deficits that are “unknown [and] unanticipated when the appropriation bills were \nsigned.” Order 6. The district court cited no authority for that constitutional holding, which limits the legislature's \npower to delegate, and we are aware of none. This Court has approved many delegations that did not involve changed \ncircumstances or emergency situations. E.g., Krebes, 226 N.W.2d at 619; Reyburn, 78 N.W.2d at 354-56. A delegation \nfrom the legislature is permissible under Lee so long as it contains “a reasonably clear policy or standard of action.” \nThat standard is comfortably satisfied in this case. \n \n*26 Conclusion \n \nThe judgment of the district court should be reversed. \n \nDeanna BRAYTON, et al., Respondents, v.
