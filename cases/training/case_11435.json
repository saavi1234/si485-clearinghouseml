    "summary": "<p>On February 25, 2008, the plaintiff, a pre-arraignment detainee in the Santa Cruz County Jail, filed a class action lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 in the United States Court for the District of Arizona, Tucson Division against Santa Cruz County. The plaintiff, represented by private counsel, asked the court for injunctive and compensatory relief, claiming violation of his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that the blanket policy of strip-searching and cavity searching all pre-arraignment detainees without reasonable suspicion was a violation of the plaintiff's right to due process and to be free from unreasonable search and seizure, and violated established Supreme Court precedent in Bell v. Wolfish. </p><p>Between 2006 and 2008, the plaintiff, the putative class representative, was arrested several times in Santa Cruz County on various minor offenses. Each time, when he was detained in the Santa Cruz County Jail, he was, in the company of other detainees and in full view of others, required to stand naked, lift his genitals, and expose his anus for visual inspection.  This was a routine procedure that all detainees at the jail were compelled to undergo. </p><p>The class was never certified because the case settled before the defendants and plaintiffs litigated class certification.</p><p>On January 15, 2009, the Court (Judge Raner C. Collins) entered an unpublished order approving a stipulated settlement that would dismiss the case with prejudice, after a fairness hearing. </p><p>In the Stipulated Settlement Agreement, the County agreed to pay 3.2 million dollars to a fund from which class members could claim damages. The class was described as people who had been subjected to strip and cavity searches without reasonable suspicion in the Santa Cruz County Jail, with the named plaintiff to receive $50,000. Attorney fees were awarded in the amount of  $725,000.  No injunctive-like provisions were included in the Stipulated Settlement.</p><p>The fairness hearing was held on July 13, 2009, and the Court approved the settlement, and dismissed the case the same day.  The case has been closed.</p>",

The  complaint \n16  alleged that the County's practices relating to strip searching certain arrestees and inmates \n17  violated rights of these individuals guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment to the United \n18  States, in several respects: the complaint alleged that blanket strip searches were being \n19  performed on pre-arraignment arrestees for whom there was no reasonable suspicion that \n20  they may be attempting to conceal contraband or weapons and the strip searches were \n21  conducted; in an area where others, not participating in the searches, could observe the \n22  persons being strip searched and who included members of the opposite sex. \n23  The  Parties  conducted  discovery  that  included  exchange  of documents, \n24  interrogatories, depositions, and inspection of the County's jail facilities. \n25  As  the  result  of the  filing  of this  Class  Action  Complaint,  the  Sheriffs \n26  Office issued revised strip search policies. Plaintiff is satisfied that, as of August 26, 2008, \n27  the Sheriffs Office strip search policies are essentially in conformity with federal law. \n28 \n1989906-1  2 \n1990272.1 \n11125/08 \n\nCase 4:08-cv-00139-RCC   Document 36-1   Filed 06/12/09   Page 5 of 29\n1  On November 24 and 25, 2008 the Parties participated in mediation sessions \n2  presided  over  by  the  Honorable  Lawrence  Fleischman  (Pima  County  Superior  Court \n3  judge, retired) and agreed to this Stipulation of Settlement which, subject to the approval \n4  of the Court, settles this action in the manner and upon the terms set forth below and fully \n5  resolves the dispute. \n6  NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY STIPULATED AND AGREED, by \n7  and between the Parties as follows: \n8  II. \n9  DEFINITIONS \n10  1.  \"Administrator\"  means Gilardi  and Co.,  LLC, P.

Up to $250,000 of the Settlement Fund may be used for costs of claims administration. Up to $2,162,300 may \nbe used to pay valid claims. The representative plaintiff will receive a payment of $50,000, subject to Court approval. \n2. Payments to Class Members Who File Claims. \nMoney for the class will be paid out based on a distribution formula, subject to payments being proportionately reduced if the total \nvalue of verified claims exceeds $2,162,300. \nPursuant to that distribution formula, members of the Settlement Class, upon return of a verified Claim Form, shall receive the following: \na.  All Settlement Class Members (โSCMsโ) arrested on charges not involving violence, drugs or weapons (โnon VDW \noffensesโ) excluding:  1) persons who, at the time of such Class Period booking were on parole, 2) persons who, at the \ntime of such booking, were required to submit to a search of their person as a condition of probation, and 3) persons \nwho, at the time of such booking, had been arrested on a VDW during the preceding seven (7) years who were strip-\nsearched, shall receive One Thousand, Seven Hundred Fifty Dollars ($1,750.00) for each booking, up to a maximum \nof two (2). \nb.

Your Options as a Class Member. \n1.  Be Bound by, and Participate in the Settlement. \nTo qualify for a payment, you must send in a completed Claim Form to the Claims Administrator. A Claim Form is included in this \nnotice package. You can also get a Claim Form by: (1) calling this toll free number:         [provided by Gilardi]            ; (2) visiting the \nwebsite,      [provided by Gilardi]             ; 3) requesting a Claim Form from the offices of Class Counsel at: The Law Office of Mark \nE. Merin, 2001 P Street #100, Sacramento, CA 95811, telephone (916) 443-6911; or (4) writing the Claims Administrator at: \nGarcia v. County of Santa Cruz Strip Search Class Action, c/o Claims Administrator, P.O. Box 8060, San Rafael, CA 94912-8060.  \nYou have until May 16, 2009, to submit a Claim Form. \nMail your completed Claim Form to: Garcia v. County of Santa Cruz Strip Search Class Action, c/o Claims Administrator, P.O. \nBox 8060, San Rafael, CA 94912-8060.   \nIf you need assistance in completing the claim form, feel free to contact one of the class counsel, Mark E. Merin at the Law Office of \nMark E. Merin, 2001 P Street, Suite 100, Sacramento, CA 95811, (916) 443-6911. \nRemember, if you do not submit a Claim Form, you cannot get a payment. Also, please note that Class Members who have already \nsettled their claims with the County of Santa Cruz or gone to trial with the County of Santa Cruz cannot receive a payment under this \nsettlement. If you submit a Claim Form, you will be bound by the Settlement and receive money (if you are a class member). If you \ndo not submit a Claim form but did not exclude yourself from the class, you will be bound by the terms of the Settlement and dismissal \nentered in this case, but you will not receive any money. \nBy participating in the S ettlement you will be waiving all  your rights to all claims up to August 26, 2008, related to  pre-\narraignment strip searches that took place in any Santa Cruz County detention facility, even those of which you are not aware at present.  \nBy participating, you will be giving up unsuspected claims in the areas covered by the litigation. \n2. Exclude Yourself From the Class. \nYou do not have to take part in the Settlement or be a member of the class.  This is called โexcludingโ yourself.  If you exclude yourself, you \ncannot get a payment and you cannot object to the Settlement.  Any Court orders will not apply to you.  To exclude yourself, you must file a \nRequest for Exclusion (Opt-Out) with the Clerk of the Court at United States District Court for the District of Arizona, 405 West Congress \nStreet, Suite 6170, Tucson, Arizona , on or before May 16, 2009, or as the Court may otherwise direct.  You must also sign a request for \nexclusion letter that states that you want to be excluded from Garcia v. County of Santa Cruz, et al., Case No. CV 08-00139-TUC-RCC.  Your \nexclusion letter must be mailed and postmarked before May 16, 2009, to: Garcia v. County of Santa Cruz Strip Search Class Action, c/o \nClaim Administrator, P.O. Box 8060, San Rafael, CA 94912-8060.   \nIf you do not follow these instructions properly, you will lose your right to exclude yourself.  If you exclude yourself, you cannot get any money \nfrom the Settlement and you cannot tell the Court you do not like the Settlement (which is called โobjectingโ).  If you exclude yourself, you are \nno longer part of the class or the Settlement, but you can sue the County of Santa Cruz on your own if you choose to do so. \nD. Fairness Hearing and Process for Objections.  \nA fairness hearing will be held on          [fairness hearing date]     , at the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, 405 \nWest Congress Street, Suite 6170, Tucson, Arizona.  If you are a class member and do not exclude yourself, you can tell the Court you \ndo not like the Settlement or some part of it at this hearing. This is called objecting to the Settlement. For example, you can say you do \nnot think the Settlement is fair or adequate. The Court will consider your views. \nTo object, you must send a letter to the Court that contains all of the following: (1) The name and title of the lawsuit, Garcia v. County \nof Santa Cruz, et al., Case No. CV 08-00139-TUC-RCC; (2) A statement of each objection you have and the facts that  support the \nobjections; (3) A description of any law or case supporting the objections; (4) A statement on whether or not you or your lawyer will \nask to appear at the Fairness Hearing to talk about your objections, and, if so, how long you will need to present your objections; and \n(5) Copies of any documents you or your lawyer will present at the Fairness Hearing. \nIndividually, or through counsel, any class member has the right to object to the proposed Settlement as a whole, to the amount of \nattorneys' fees and costs of Class Counsel, or to any portion of either.

Plaintiff GEORGE VICTOR GARCIA, and all those similarly situated, are, and \nat all material times herein, were residents of the state of Arizona who were arrested within the \nperiod beginning two (2) years before the filing of this Complaint, and continuing to this date, \nand who were subjected to strip and/or visual body cavity searches at SANTA CRUZ COUNTY \nJail (hereinafter referred to as ASANTA CRUZ COUNTY Jail@), prior to being arraigned and/or \nwithout the defendants first having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the \nsearches would be productive of contraband or weapons. \n2\n\nCase 4:08-cv-00139-RCC   Document 1    Filed 02/25/08   Page 3 of 16\n2. Defendant SANTA CRUZ COUNTY (hereinafter referred to as ASANTA CRUZ \nCOUNTY@) is a body politic and political subdivision of the state of Arizona.  SANTA CRUZ \nCOUNTY had an obligation to construct a county jail and to provide for the confinement of \nprisoners incarcerated under the COUNTYโs jurisdiction.  SANTA CRUZ COUNTY had an \nobligation to appropriate funds and otherwise provide the necessary funding to maintain and \noperate a facility for the incarceration of prisoners under the jurisdiction of the COUNTY.\n3. Defendant SANTA CRUZ COUNTY SHERIFF TONY ESTRADA (ASHERIFF\nESTRADA@) is, and at all material times herein, was a resident of SANTA CRUZ COUNTY and \nthe duly elected SHERIFF of SANTA CRUZ COUNTY with the duty to administer the county \njail and provide for the well-being of the prisoners within the county jail.  In addition, at all \ntimes material hereto, defendant SHERIFF ESTRADA was acting within the scope of his duties \nas well as under color of law.  He is sued in his individual and official capacities. \n4. Defendants DOES 1 THROUGH 50, inclusive, are SANTA CRUZ COUNTY \nSHERIFF DEPUTIES who were sued herein by their fictitious names and are all deputies who, \nas part of their duties at the SANTA CRUZ COUNTY Jail, subjected plaintiff, and all those he \nrepresents, to pre-arraignment strip and/or visual body cavity searches without having, and \nrecording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband \nor weapons.\n5. At all material times mentioned herein, each of the defendants was acting under \nthe color of law, to wit, under color of statutes, ordinances, regulations, policies, customs and \nusages of the state of Arizona, SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, and/or the SANTA CRUZ COUNTY \nSHERIFF=S DEPARTMENT.\n3\n\nCase 4:08-cv-00139-RCC   Document 1    Filed 02/25/08   Page 4 of 16\n6. Defendant SHERIFF ESTRADA was responsible for the screening, hiring, \ntraining, monitoring, supervision, and disciplining of subordinate employees of the SANTA \nCRUZ COUNTY Jail and was the authority empowering the SANTA CRUZ COUNTY \nDEPUTIES to incarcerate prisoners under the jurisdiction of SANTA CRUZ COUNTY.\n7. Defendant SHERIFF ESTRADA was responsible for administering the jail \nfacilities and for making, overseeing, and implementing the policies, practices, and customs \nchallenged herein relating to the operation of the SANTA CRUZ COUNTY Jail.\n8. Defendant SHERIFF ESTRADA, in his individual and official capacities, \nmaintained or permitted an official policy or custom of causing or permitting the occurrence of \nthe types of wrongs complained of herein, which wrongs damaged plaintiff and all those \nsimilarly situated as alleged herein.   \n9. Class action plaintiffs are those similarly situated who, during the period \nbeginning two (2) years before the filing of this Complaint, and continuing to this date, were \nsubjected by defendants to pre-arraignment strip and/or visual body cavity searches without \ndefendants having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be \nproductive of contraband or weapons.\nIII.\nFACTS\n10. During the two (2) years preceding the filing of this Complaint, plaintiff \nGEORGE VICTOR GARCIA (hereinafter referred to as โPlaintiffโ) was arrested on multiple \noccasions for minor offenses such as drinking in public, shoplifting, or disorderly conduct \nfollowing which arrests he was transported to SANTA CRUZ COUNTY Jail where, prior to \nappearance before a judge for arraignment and without there being any reasonable suspicion that \n4\n\nCase 4:08-cv-00139-RCC   Document 1    Filed 02/25/08   Page 5 of 16\nhe was concealing contraband, plaintiff, pursuant to policies, practices, and procedures of \ndefendants, and each of them, was subjected to a visual body cavity search (strip search) in \nviolation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  Plaintiff \nwas coerced, forced, and compelled to disrobe for the strip searches in areas that could be \nobserved by persons who were not participating in the search and who included members of the \nopposite sex.\n11. On each occasion, plaintiff was required to remove all of his clothes, lift his \ngenitals, bend over to expose his anus for inspection, individually, and in groups of other \ndetainees.\n12. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that defendants \nroutinely follow their policy, practice, and custom of subjecting pre-arraignment detainees, \nincluding plaintiff, and all those he represents, to strip and visual body cavity searches without \nfirst having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches will be productive \nof contraband or weapons; and that such searches are generally conducted both in groups and in \nareas where the searches can be and are observed by persons not participating in the searches, \nincluding guards of the sex opposite to those who are being searched. \n13. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that defendants have the \nability to identify all such similarly situated plaintiffs, specifically those who, while in \ndefendants= custody at the SANTA CRUZ COUNTY Jail within two (2) years prior to the filing \nof this Complaint, were subjected to strip searches and/or visual body cavity searches prior to  \narraignment without defendants first having, and recording, a reasonable suspicion that the \n5\n\nCase 4:08-cv-00139-RCC   Document 1    Filed 02/25/08   Page 6 of 16\nsearches would be productive of contraband or weapons. \n14. Defendant SANTA CRUZ COUNTY and SHERIFF ESTRADA are personally \nresponsible for the promulgation and continuation of the strip search policy, practice, and custom \npursuant to which plaintiff, and those he represents, were subjected to strip searches. \n15. As a result of being subjected to the strip searches complained of herein, plaintiff, \nand each of the persons similarly situated, suffered physical, mental, and emotional distress, \ninvasion of privacy, and violation of due process of law and federal statutory and constitutional \nrights, and are entitled to recover damages according to proof. \nIV.\n  CLASS CLAIMS\n16. The strip and visual body cavity searches to which plaintiff, and all those \nsimilarly situated, were subjected were performed pursuant to policies, practices, and customs of \ndefendants SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, SHERIFF ESTRADA, and SHERIFF=S DEPUTIES sued \nherein by the fictitious names 1 through 50.  The searches complained of herein were performed \nwithout regard to the nature of the alleged offenses for which plaintiff, and all those similarly \nsituated, had been arrested, without regard to whether or not plaintiff, and all those he represents, \nwere eligible for cite and release, without regard to whether or not plaintiff, and those similarly \nsituated, were eligible for and/or were released on his or her own recognizance, or on bail.\nFurthermore, the searches complained of herein were performed without defendants having a \nreasonable belief that the plaintiff, or any of those similarly situated, so searched possessed \nweapons or contraband, and those facts being articulated and recorded in a supervisor-approved \ndocument.  And the searches complained of herein were performed without defendants taking \nreasonable precautions to make certain that plaintiff, and each of those similarly situated, were \n6\n\nCase 4:08-cv-00139-RCC   Document 1    Filed 02/25/08   Page 7 of 16\nnot observed by others not involved in the search. \n17. Plaintiff brings this action on his own behalf and on behalf of all persons similarly \nsituated pursuant to Rule 23, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n18. The class of plaintiffs is defined to include all persons arrested on charges not \ninvolving violence, drugs or weapons who, in the period from and including two (2) years prior \nto the filing of this Complaint, and continuing until this matter is adjudicated and the practices \ncomplained of herein cease, were arrested and subjected to a pre-arraignment strip and/or visual \nbody cavity search at the SANTA CRUZ COUNTY Jail without defendants first having, and \nrecording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband \nor weapons. \n19. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the members of \nthe class are so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical.  Plaintiff does not know the \nexact number of class members.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that \nthere are more than 10 persons per day who are arrested by defendants and/or are in the custody \nof defendants who are and have been subjected to the searches complained of herein as a result \nof defendants= policy, practice, and custom relating to said searches.   \n20. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiff is \ninformed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that there are many questions of fact common to \nthe class including, but not limited to: (1) whether defendants routinely subject all persons \narrested to visual body cavity searches prior to arraignment if they intend such persons to be \nhoused in the SANTA CRUZ COUNTY Jail; (2) whether persons are subjected to strip and/or \nvisual body cavity searches prior to arraignment without there being any reasonable suspicion, \n7\n\nCase 4:08-cv-00139-RCC   Document 1    Filed 02/25/08   Page 8 of 16\nbased on specific or articulable facts, to believe any particular arrestee has concealed drugs, \nweapons, and/or contraband in bodily cavities which could be detected by means of a strip \nand/or visual body cavity search; (3) whether the strip and/or visual body cavity searches are \nconducted in an area of privacy so that the searches cannot be observed by persons not \nparticipating in the searches; (4) whether the strip and/or visual body cavity searches are \nperformed in groups; and (5) whether the strip and/or visual body cavity searches are reasonably \nrelated to defendants= penological interest to maintain the security of the jail and whether or not \nthere are less intrusive methods for protecting any such interest.  \n21. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiff is \ninformed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that there are many questions of law common to \nthe class including, but not limited to: (1) whether defendants may perform strip and/or visual \nbody cavity searches on persons prior to their arraignment without reasonable suspicion, based \non specific or articulable facts, to believe any particular prearraignment detainee has concealed \ndrugs, weapons and/or contraband which would likely be discovered by a strip and/or visual \nbody cavity search; (2) whether defendants may perform strip and/or visual body cavity searches \non persons without first reasonably relating the strip search of the subject to defendants=\npenological interest to maintain the security of the jail and determining if there is a less intrusive \nmethod to protect that interest; (3) whether strip and/or visual body cavity searches may be \nconducted in areas where the search can be observed by persons not participating in the search \nwithout violating plaintiffs= Federal constitutional and statutory rights; (4) whether or not \ndefendants= may strip search persons in groups in accordance with the Federal constitution; and \n(5) whether or not defendants have immunity or qualified immunity defenses to plaintiff=s\n8\n\nCase 4:08-cv-00139-RCC   Document 1    Filed 02/25/08   Page 9 of 16\nclaims.    \n22. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the claims of the \nrepresentative plaintiff is typical of the class.  Plaintiff was arrested on minor offenses not \ninvolving violence, drugs or weapons and was searched, prior to arraignment, without \ndefendants having a reasonable suspicion that a strip or visual body cavity search would produce \ndrugs, weapons or contraband (and without the facts supporting any such suspicion being \narticulated in a supervisor-approved writing).  Representative plaintiff has the same interests and \nsuffered the same type of injuries as did all of the other class members.  Plaintiff=s claims arose \nbecause of defendants= policy, practice, and custom of subjecting arrestees to strip and/or visual \nbody cavity searches before arraignment without having, and recording in writing, a reasonable \nsuspicion that the search would be productive of contraband or weapons.  Each class member \nsuffered actual damages as a result of being subjected to a strip and/or visual body cavity search. \n The actual damages suffered by the representative plaintiff is similar in type and amount to the \nactual damages suffered by each class member.   \n23. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the \nrepresentative plaintiff will fairly and adequately protect the class interests.  Plaintiff=s interests \nare consistent with and not antagonistic to the interests of the class.\n24. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(A), \nprosecution of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk that \ninconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class would \nestablish incompatible standards of conduct for the parties opposing the complaint.   \n25. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(B), \n9\n\nCase 4:08-cv-00139-RCC   Document 1    Filed 02/25/08   Page 10 of 16\nprosecution of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk of \ninconsistent adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would, as a \npractical matter, substantially impair or impede the interests of the other members of the class to \nprotect their interests. \n26. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(2), plaintiff is \ninformed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that defendants have acted on grounds generally \napplicable to the class, thereby making appropriate the final injunctive or declaratory relief with \nrespect to the class as a whole.\n27. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), this class \naction is superior to other available methods for the fair and equitable adjudication of the \ncontroversy between the parties.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that \nthe interests of members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution of a separate \naction is low, in that most class members would be unable individually to prosecute any action at \nall.  Plaintiff also is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that the amounts at stake for \nindividuals are so small that separate suits would be impracticable.  Plaintiff is informed and \nbelieves, and thereupon alleges, that most members of the class will not be able to find counsel \nto represent them.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that it is desirable to \nconcentrate all litigation in one forum because all of the claims arise in the same location; i.e., \nthe SANTA CRUZ COUNTY Jail.  It will promote judicial efficiency to resolve the common \nquestions of law and fact in one forum, rather than in multiple courts.   \n28. Plaintiff does not know the identities of all of the class members.  Plaintiff is \ninformed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that the identities of the class members may be \n10\n\nCase 4:08-cv-00139-RCC   Document 1    Filed 02/25/08   Page 11 of 16\nascertained from records maintained by defendants SANTA CRUZ COUNTY and SHERIFF \nESTRADA.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that defendants= records \nreflect the identities, including addresses and telephone numbers, of the persons who have been \nheld in custody in the SANTA CRUZ COUNTY Jail.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and \nthereupon alleges, that records of, and maintained by defendants reflect who was subject to a \nstrip and/or visual body cavity search, when the search occurred, where the search occurred, \nwhether any reasonable suspicion for the search existed and was recorded in a supervisor-\napproved writing, whether the search was videotaped, when persons searched were arraigned, \nand the charges on which such persons were arrested.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and \nthereupon alleges, that all of the foregoing information is contained in defendants= computer \nsystem and that the information necessary to identify the class members, by last known \naddresses, and the dates and reasons for their arrests and/or release from custody, is readily \navailable from said computer system.   \n29. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(c)(2)(b), class \nmembers must be furnished with the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including \nindividual notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort.  Plaintiff is \ninformed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that defendants= computer records contain a last \nknown address for class members.  Plaintiff contemplates that individual notice will be given to \nclass members at such last known address by first class mail.  Plaintiff contemplates that the \nnotice will inform class members of the following: \ni. The pendency of the class action and the issues common to the class; \nii. The nature of the action; \n11\n\nCase 4:08-cv-00139-RCC   Document 1    Filed 02/25/08   Page 12 of 16\niii. Their right to Aopt out@ of the action within a given time, in which event \nthey will not be bound by a decision rendered in the class action; \niv. Their right, if they do not Aopt out,@ to be represented by their own counsel \nand to enter an appearance in the case; otherwise they will be represented \nby the named class plaintiff and the named class plaintiff=s counsel; and\nv. Their right, if they do not Aopt out,@ to share in any recovery in favor of \nthe class, and conversely to be bound by any judgment on the common \nissues adverse to the class.\nV.\nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION\n(Civil Rights Violations Under 42 USC ' 1983) \n30. Plaintiff incorporates by reference into this cause of action the allegations in each \nof the preceding paragraphs, as fully as if realleged and set forth herein. \n31.  Defendants= policies, practices, and customs regarding the strip and visual body \ncavity searches complained of herein violated plaintiff=s, and all those similarly situated=s,\nclearly established rights under the Fourth Amendment to be free from unreasonable searches \nand seizures, violated plaintiff=s, and all those similarly situated=s, clearly established rights to \ndue process and privacy under the Fourteenth Amendment, and directly and proximately \ndamaged plaintiff, and all those similarly situated, as herein alleged, entitling plaintiff, and all \nclass members, to recover damages for said constitutional violations pursuant to 42 U.S.C. '\n1983.\nWHEREFORE, plaintiff prays for relief, for himself and for all persons similarly \nsituated, as hereunder appears.\n12\n\nCase 4:08-cv-00139-RCC   Document 1    Filed 02/25/08   Page 13 of 16\nVI.\nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Declaratory and Injunctive Relief) \n32. Plaintiff incorporates by reference into his second cause of action the allegations \nof the preceding paragraphs, as fully as if realleged and set forth herein. \n33. Plaintiff, on behalf of himself and the members of the class, seeks a judgment \ndeclaring that Defendants must cease the activities described herein and enjoining Defendants \nfrom any further strip searches without individualized reasonable suspicion. \n34. The constitutional violations alleged herein arise from official policies and \npractices sanctioned by Defendants.  The harm which plaintiff and the members of the class have \nsustained are clearly traceable to these officially sanctioned policies and procedures. \n35. Plaintiff and members of the class do not have a plain, adequate, speedy, or \ncomplete remedy at law to address the wrongs alleged in this Complaint, and they will suffer \nirreparable injury as a result of Defendants= misconduct unless injunctive and declaratory relief is \ngranted.  Plaintiff and members of the class are in real and immediate danger of sustaining \nfuture, direct injury as a result of Defendants= official policies and practices that are ongoing at \nthe time of this suit. \n36. No cognizable burden will be placed on Defendants by requiring that no strip \nsearches be undertaken without individualized reasonable suspicion.  The public interest would \nbe greatly enhanced by enforcement of policies and practices which adhere to the requirements \nof the state and federal Constitutions.  Absent injunctive relief, there is no guarantee that the \nDefendants will cease their illegal policies and practices as alleged herein. \n37. By reason of the foregoing, plaintiff and members of the class are entitled to \n13\n\nCase 4:08-cv-00139-RCC   Document 1    Filed 02/25/08   Page 14 of 16\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief as set forth above. \nVII.\n  DAMAGES \n38. The above paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference as if fully set forth in \nthis paragraph. \n39. As a direct and proximate result of the wrongful and unlawful actions of \nDefendants, described above, plaintiff and the members of the class were injured and have \nsuffered and continue to suffer damages, including but not limited to distress, anguish, suffering, \nhumiliation, deprivation of constitutional rights, and other incidental, consequential, and special \ndamages. \n40. Defendants= acts and omissions, as set forth herein, were malicious, reckless, \nwanton, oppressive, and/or fraudulent, justifying an award of punitive damages against the \nindividually named defendants including SHERIFF ESTRADA and DOES 1 THROUGH 50 \nwhose real names and identities will be substituted for the fictitious names stated herein as soon \nas said names are determined, for the purpose of punishment and to deter others from the \ncommission of like offenses. \nVIII.\n  PRAYER \nWHEREFORE, plaintiff, on behalf of himself and on behalf of the members of the class \nrepresented herein, respectfully prays for and demands judgment against the Defendants as \nfollows: \n(a) For judgment against defendants for compensatory damages, special \ndamages, consequential damages and incidental damages under any or all \n14\n\nCase 4:08-cv-00139-RCC   Document 1    Filed 02/25/08   Page 15 of 16\nof the causes of action, in an amount to be determined at the trial of this \ncause;\n(b) For judgment declaring the rights of the parties; \n(c) For injunctive relief; \n(d) For reasonable attorneys= fees and costs incurred herein; \n(e) For pre-judgment and post-judgment interest in amounts to be determined \naccording to law; \n(f) For an award of punitive and exemplary damages, in an amount to be \ndetermined at the trial of this cause; and \n(g) For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper. \n///\nJURY TRIAL REQUEST\nCOMES NOW plaintiff GEORGE VICTOR GARCIA, by and through his counsel, \nbelow listed, on his own behalf and on behalf of a class of similarly situated persons, and hereby \ndemands trial by jury pursuant to the terms and conditions of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \n38, in regard to all issues in the above-referenced cause. \nDATED:  February 25, 2008   Respectfully submitted, \n15\n\nCase 4:08-cv-00139-RCC   Document 1    Filed 02/25/08   Page 16 of 16\nBy:__Electronically Signed 2/25/08 \nMark E.
