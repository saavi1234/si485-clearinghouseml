    "summary": "<p>On December 22, 2009, four groups of foster parents and children directly receiving foster care maintenance payments or adoption assistance payments from the Indiana Department of Child Services (\"DCS\"), filed a law suit against DCS and its director (\"Payne\") under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU of Indiana and private counsel, asked the court for injunctive relief, alleging that the DCS violated Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 670, et seq. Specifically, the plaintiffs asked the District Court to enjoin DCS from implementing a 10% reduction in foster care and adoption assistance payments.</p><p>The plaintiffs alleged that DCS unlawfully reduced foster care and adoption assistance payments. DCS receives money from the federal government through Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 670, et seq., from which monthly payments are made to foster parents and adoptive parents. DCS had enacted a 10% reduction in these payments, effective in January of 2010. Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 673(a)(3), the amount of foster care and adoption assistance payments must be determined by considering the circumstances of the adopting parents and the needs of the child being adopted. The plaintiffs contended that the 10% reduction violated this provision because the reduction was motivated by budgetary constraints and not the individual assessments families receiving the payments or the general costs of providing care for the children in question. </p><p>On December 22, 2009, the plaintiffs moved to certify as a class all foster parents and children directly receiving foster care maintenance payments or adoption assistance payments from DCS.  On January 25, 2010, the District Court (Judge Sarah Evans Barker) granted the motion, certifying the claims of C.H. plaintiffs to proceed as a class action. </p><p>On December 28, 2010, the Indiana Association of Residential Child Care Agencies (\"IARCCA\"), the plaintiff in a separate action against DCS seeking to enjoin the 10% payment reduction, made an unopposed motion to consolidate cases. On January 25, 2010, the district court granted the motion to consolidate the case filed by IARCCA. </p><p>On January 20, 2010, the district court issued a preliminary injunction stopping the planned 10% reduction in foster care and adoption assistance payments. DCS appealed this preliminary injunction to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals on February 18, 2010. This appeal was dismissed. </p><p>On February 9, 2011, the parties executed a settlement agreement. The agreement stipulated that DCS would cease its effort to reduce foster care payments. Further, the agreement required DCS to continue to provide foster care maintenance payments of at least $25 a day until it established a method of computing the costs that satisfied the requirements of 42 U.S.C. § 673(a)(3). DCS was not precluded by the settlement agreement from reducing foster care payments once it had established a new method of computing such payments. The agreement allowed foster parents to challenge the new rates once they were established through the application of the new method of payment calculation. The agreement further provided that DCS pay $104,812 in attorneys' fees and costs.</p><p>On February 25, 2011, the the district court approved a Joint Stipulation of Dismissal, which dismissed with prejudice the claims made by C.H. against Payne and vacated the Court's Preliminary Injunction. On the same day, the court dismissed without prejudice the claim by IARCCA against Payne. The Joint Stipulation of Dismissal provided that the claims made in the Complaint could not be reopened unless DCS breached the Settlement Agreement or applicable law before 30 days after the new rates went into effect.</p><p>On November 30, 2011, the plaintiffs filed notice of intent to reopen litigation, alleging that the defendants had violated provisions of the settlement agreement. Because DCS scheduled decreases to the rates at which it would reimburse service providers, overall coverage of treatment provided to children would decrease. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint and an application for a preliminary injunction in December 2011.</p><p>At the court's suggestion, the plaintiffs moved in May 2012 to enforce the settlement agreement along with a motion for a preliminary injunction. The parties held a series of pretrial settlement conferences before Magistrate Judge Mark J. Dinsmore in May and June 2012. By late June, the parties agreed to stipulations to resolve the pending motions by agreeing to withdraw them. The parties officially reported a settlement and the case was officially dismissed in November 2012.</p>",

Accordingly, we summarize the facts of each case separately. \n \n \n2  The reimbursement rate is set prior to each federal fiscal year by the federal government. This rate has risen in each of \nthe last three fiscal years, from 62.69% in fiscal year (“FY”) 2008, to 64.26% in FY 2009, and 65.93% in FY 2010. In \n \nFebruary 2009, the federal stimulus bill raised the reimbursement rate an additional 6.2% for expenses incurred from \nOctober 1, 2008 through December 31, 2010. Thus, the current reimbursement rate is 72.13%. \n \n3  To be eligible for foster care maintenance payments, the child, among other requirements, must have met the eligibility \nrequirements for the former Aid to Families with Dependent Children in the month of his or her removal from the home. \n \nSee 42 U.S.C. § 672(a)(2). \n \n4  In Indiana, a “special needs child” is defined as follows: \n(1) The county office of family and children has determined that the child cannot or should not be returned to the \n \nhome of the child’s parent or parents and that the parent or parents have signed or will sign a consent to adoption \nregarding the child or that parental rights have been or will be terminated by a court in accordance with IC 31–35. \n(2) One (1) of the following conditions exist: \n(A) The child is two (2) years of age or older. \n(B) The child is a member of a sibling group of two (2) or more children of which at least one (1) is two (2) years \nof age or older and who will be placed with the sibling group in the same home. \n(C) The child has a medical condition or physical, mental, or emotional disability as determined by a physician \n \n \n\n \nlicensed to practice in Indiana or another state or territory. \n(3) Reasonable but unsuccessful efforts must be made to place the child in an appropriate adoptive home without \nproviding adoption assistance. Reasonable efforts include, but are not limited to, the following: \n(A) Photo listing the child with the Indiana adoption resource exchange for a minimum of six (6) months. \n(B) Inability to recruit appropriate, interested adoptive parent or parents who are able to meet the child’s needs \nwithout the use of adoption assistance. \n465 Ind. Admin. Code 2–7–2. \n \n5  Evidence was adduced to establish that the cost of providing necessary essentials for a foster child was, on average, \nsignificantly higher than the costs associated with raising children not in foster care, due to the fact that many children \n \nin foster care suffer from emotional, behavioral, or developmental problems. \n \n6  Although DCS removed education and child care expenditures from its calculation, some expenses within those \ncategories are in fact reimbursable under Title IV–E. \n \n \n7  The USDA Report indicated that in families with only one child the expense figure should be multiplied by a factor of \n1.25 to reflect a more reasonable amount. \n \n \n8  At some point before DCS instituted the ten percent reduction in foster care maintenance payments, the State Budget \nAgency had requested that DCS set aside a reserve of another ten percent of its funds for reversion back to the State. \n \n \n9  Plaintiffs  contend  that  the  State  may,  and  does,  pay  above  that  percentage  while  still  obtaining  Title  IV–E \nreimbursement for its expenditures, provided that the adoption assistance per diem does not exceed the foster care \n \nrate as provided by federal law. \n \n10  According to Mr. Weinberg, in certain cases the rates paid to some Providers were five times higher than the rates paid \nto other Providers for what appeared to be similar programs and services. \n \n \n11  Plaintiffs deny that they ever made such a request. When asked on cross-examination, Mr. Weinberg could not recall \nthe names of any specific individual or individuals who proposed the compression idea. \n \n \n12  Because the rates did not increase in 2009, this represents a twenty percent reduction in the Providers’ 2008 rates. \n \n \n13  This additional reduction was based on DCS’s determination that about sixty-three percent of the LCPA contract rate \nrepresented the pass through per diem to the foster parent for maintenance payments. Thus, to reflect the ten percent \n \nreduction in the foster parents’ per diem rate, DCS reduced the Placement Providers’ contract rates the additional \n6.3%. \n \n14  We were informed at the hearing that many providers are not-for-profit organizations who are required by their bylaws \nto convene their boards of directors before making significant financial decisions or entering into contracts. Plaintiffs \n \ncontend that this accelerated time period was wholly insufficient to allow them to schedule such meetings, let alone to \nanalyze their budgets and determine whether they could continue to provide the services they are contractually \nobligated to perform with the decreased rates, particularly since the deadline fell during the end-of-the-year holiday \nperiod. Plaintiffs viewed this timetable as harsh and insensitive to their interests and those they are seeking to serve. \n \n15  The M.A.R.C. in Indiana was calculated in 2006 to be $630 per month for a two-year-old, $722 per month for a \nnine-year-old, and $791 per month for a sixteen-year-old. Assuming 30.4 days in a month (365/12), Indiana’s 2010 \n \nmonthly reimbursement rate is $684 ($22.50 x 30.4). \n \n16  As discussed above, DCS was instructed to reserve 10% of its budget and subsequently cut the foster care \nmaintenance payments by the same percentage. \n \n \n17  DCS contends that state regulations require that the adoption assistance payments in Indiana be no more than \nseventy-five percent of the foster care maintenance payments, and thus, the ten percent cut in adoption assistance \n \npayments was required. The applicable regulatory provision provides: “The amount of the adoption assistance shall not \nexceed the [foster care] per diem paid by any county department of public welfare in Indiana or seventy-five percent \n(75%) of the per diem paid by the placing county department of public welfare, whichever is greater.” 465 IAC 2–7–3. \nHowever, the county departments no longer perform this task since the State took over child welfare costs, including \nadoption assistance payments, from counties on January 1, 2009. Moreover DCS has stipulated that, under certain \n \n \n\n \ncircumstances, it has made adoption assistance payments in amounts equal to the foster care maintenance payment \nrate. \n \n18  Under Title IV–E, Providers are entitled to reimbursement for expenses such as recruitment and training of foster \nparents, placement of children into foster care, case plan development and management, and certain administrative \n \ncosts. \n \n19  There is no Eleventh Amendment prohibition to our consideration of this issue because Defendants waived their \nimmunity by removing this case to federal court on December 23, 2009. See Lapides v. Board of Regents of Univ. Sys. \n \nof Georgia, 535 U.S. 613, 624, 122 S.Ct. 1640, 152 L.Ed.2d 806 (2002) (“[R]emoval is a form of voluntary invocation of \na federal court’s jurisdiction sufficient to waive the State’s otherwise valid objection to litigation of a matter (here of \nstate law) in a federal forum.”). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

The lawsuit is filed in federal \ncourt in Indianapolis and is entitled C.H., et al. v. James W. Payne, No. 1:10-cv-381. The case \nwas certified as a class action with four classes, which means that the individuals who filed the \ncase represent not only themselves but all others like them in the classes.  The classes are defined \nas: \n \n  Class A- \n \nall foster parents who are receiving, or will receive, foster care maintenance \npayments directly from the Indiana Department of Child Services pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. § 672. \n \n  Class B –  \nall children in foster care, or who will be in foster care, for whom foster care \nmaintenance payments are being made, or will be made, directly from the Indiana \nDepartment of Child Services pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 672. \n \nClass C-  \n \nall adoptive parents who are receiving adoption assistance payments through the \nIndiana Department of Child Services pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 673, and whose \npayments were reduced by 10% as of January 1, 2010. \n \nClass D- \n \nall adoptive children for whom adoption assistance payments are being made \nthrough the Indiana Department of Child Services pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 673, \nand whose payments were reduced by 10% as of January 1, 2010. \n \n  In January, the Court issued a preliminary injunction that prevented any cut in the foster \ncare or adoption payments. This is a temporary order in place until the case is fully resolved. \nHowever, rather than continue with the case, we have reached a settlement that resolves the case.  \nBecause this is a class action, court rules require that class members be notified of the settlement \nand be given an opportunity to comment on it.  We have summarized the settlement below and at \nthe end of this memo we have set out how you can comment on it if you wish to do so. \n \n  Under the settlement the following terms apply to foster parents and foster children \nreceiving payments directly from the Department of Child Services (DCS). \n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-MJD   Document 76-2    Filed 11/19/10   Page 2 of 3\n \n  1)  DCS agrees that it will cease its efforts to reduce the foster care payments and \n  will continue to pay at least $25 a day until it establishes a new policy.  One of the \n  criticisms in our lawsuit was that DCS had no clear method by which it was establishing \n  the new rates.  It is currently establishing a new method to compute the costs of the items \n  that are to be included in foster care maintenance payments.  It anticipates introducing \n  these new rates on or before January 1, 2011. \n \n2)  It is entirely possible that the new rates that the DCS will introduce in the future \nmay be lower than the current rates.  By entering into this settlement we are not waiving \nour right to bring a new lawsuit to challenge these rates. \n \n  Under the settlement the following terms apply to adoptive parents and their children \nwhose adoption assistance payments were scheduled to be reduced on January 1, 2010.   \n   \n  1)  DCS will continue to pay all monthly adoption assistance payments that were \n  being paid as of December 31, 2009.  This includes payments being made from both Title \n  IV-E and State funds.  These payments will not be reduced without the agreement of the \n  adoptive parents. \n \n  2)  DCS will no longer rely on any practice or policy that allows it to set a maximum \n  amount for the adoption assistance payments of 75% of the foster care maintenance \n  payments.  \n \n3)  However, federal law provides that the adoption assistance payments made under \nTitle IV-E cannot be greater than the foster care payments.  Therefore, if foster care \npayments are reduced in the future, this may have an effect on the adoption payment, \ndepending on the new foster care rate. \n \n4)  If the adoption assistance payment is less than the foster care payment, you have \nthe right to request that the adoption amount be raised if you can show it is justified by a \nchange in circumstances. \n \n  After we won the preliminary injunction DCS started an appeal of the case to the appeals \ncourt in Chicago that is the appellate court over Indiana.  DCS will dismiss its appeal of our case \nonce the settlement is approved.  And, once the settlement is approved we will dismiss this case \nwith prejudice.  This means that no class member will be able to file it again.  However, nothing \nstops  you,  or  the  attorneys,  from  filing  a  new  case  if  foster  care  payments  and  adoption \nassistance payments are reduced in the future.  \n \n  The settlement also provides that we are to be paid attorneys’ fees and costs in this case \nof $104,811.92.  This is paid by the DCS. Our services are free to our clients.  The fees go to the \nnot-for-profit organization that employs us.  \n \n  As we indicated above, under the rules governing class actions, the Court cannot approve \nthe proposed settlement without giving you notice and an opportunity to respond.  Then the \n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-MJD   Document 76-2    Filed 11/19/10   Page 3 of 3\nCourt must determine that the proposed settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate.  This is the \nnotice to the class.  No fewer than thirty (30) days after notice is given, we will inform the Court \nof any comments by class members so that the Court can make the determination of fairness or \nnot as required by the federal rules. \n \n  Therefore,  if  you  have  an  opinion  about  the  proposed  settlement,  please  mail  your \ncomments at the earliest opportunity to us at the address below.  You may also call us or e-mail \nus as well. We would be happy to send any of your written comments to the Judge.  If you want \nme to do this, please put in your letter or e-mail the following language: “I authorize you to give \nthe Court a copy of this letter including my actual name.”  If you do not do this we will not give \nthe Court a copy of the letter and we will not disclose your actual name.

IARCCA initiated this action in December 2009 against the Indiana \nDepartment of Child Services (\"DCS\") and James W. Payne (\"Payne\"), in his official capacity as \ndirector of DCS, after DCS announced that it was cutting the rates that DCS pays to the agencies \n(the \"Providers\") that provide treatment to abused, neglected and delinquent Indiana children and \ntheir families.  IARCCA contended that the rate cuts were arbitrary and unlawful. \n2.  After this Court granted a preliminary injunction, the parties entered into a \nsettlement agreement in March 2011 for the resolution of all claims in the case.  A true and \naccurate copy of the settlement agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit A.  \n3.  The settlement agreement required DCS to promulgate certain \nadministrative rules and a provider manual to govern the setting of the rates that DCS pays to the \nProviders, and to issue rates consistent with those rules.  \n4.  The settlement agreement also included agreement by the Providers to a \n5% across-the-board rate cut with certain exceptions.  Exceptions were for Providers being paid \nless than their IV-E claimable rates and Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facilities to be paid at \nthe Medicaid rate.   \n5.  Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the parties submitted, and the Court \napproved, an order dismissing the case without prejudice.  (Dkt. 88) The stipulation of dismissal \nallowed for IARCCA to seek relief in this Court for \"any breach of the settlement agreement \nbetween them, or any breach of applicable law … without having to exhaust administrative \nremedies.\" \n \n   \n2 \nBDDB01 9010752v1 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-MJD   Document 94   Filed 11/30/11   Page 3 of 6 PageID #: 1778\n \nThe New Rules & Rates \n6.  DCS filed the new rules on or about April 26, 2011 (for Residential \nProviders) and May 25, 2011 (for LCPA Providers).  DCS sought, and the Providers submitted, \ncost reports on or about May 31, 2011.  DCS published the provider manual on or about October \n20, and at that same time published Bulletins that set caps on rates.  A true and accurate copy of \nthose Bulletins is attached hereto as Exhibit B.  \n7.  On October 17, 2011, DCS issued letters to the Providers setting forth the \nrates that DCS would agree to pay beginning on January 1, 2012.  A true and accurate copy of \none such letter is attached hereto as Exhibit C. \n8.  The new rates announced by DCS represent drastic decreases to the \namounts DCS has historically paid to reimburse Providers for the services they provide – in \nsome cases, DCS intends to cut rates by more than 50%.  The rate cuts for most Providers are \nsignificantly greater than the cuts this Court previously enjoined in January 2010. \n9.  DCS did not comply with the settlement agreement, its own new rules, or \napplicable law in developing the new rates.   \n10.  For example, DCS has announced – outside of the rulemaking process – \ncaps on the amount of administrative costs it will reimburse, as a percentage of all costs.  And \nDCS has included as \"administrative\" costs several non-administrative functions, counting them \nagainst the cap.  This action is unlawful because it is arbitrary and not authorized by law. \n11.  Similarly, the cost report format required that program management costs \n(including program directors, quality assurance, and case managers) be classified in the \nadministrative column. These are program management costs that should not be subject to an \n“administrative” cap and lead to improperly low rates under DCS's own rules. \n3 \nBDDB01 9010752v1 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-MJD   Document 94   Filed 11/30/11   Page 4 of 6 PageID #: 1779\n \n12.  Making matters worse, at the time DCS required Providers to submit their \ncost reports, it had not published the provider manual, which it used to establish rates.  \nTherefore, the Providers were forced to categorize their anticipated costs without the benefit of \nthe definitions and other guidance found in the provider manual.  These actions by DCS are \ncontrary to the settlement agreement and violate Indiana law. \n13.  Additionally, DCS is requiring Providers to incur certain costs, but is \nrefusing to include them among reimbursable costs, such as a required number of visits with \nfoster children and parents. \n14.  As a further example of DCS's violations, DCS is applying staff ratios in \nan unlawful manner.  Licensing regulations (see e.g. 465 IAC 2-9-48, 465 IAC 2-10-48, 465 IAC \n2-12-48, and 465 IAC 2-13-48) require that child-caring institutions and group homes “employ \nstaff to perform administrative, supervisory, service, and direct care functions.”  Yet despite this \nseparation of supervisory staff from direct-case workers in DCS's own rules, DCS includes \nsupervisors and case managers in the direct care staff ratio calculations in the new rates, in \nviolation of the licensing provisions.  In a few cases, during the same week a Provider's \nreimbursement for staff was cut, DCS licensing personnel informed that same Provider that it \nneeded additional staff to comply with DCS licensing rules under which the Providers are \nrequired to operate. \n15.  Approximately 80 Providers who are IARCCA members have filed \nrequests for administrative review with DCS, as provided for by the new rules.   \n16.  DCS's responses to those requests are due on or about December 16, 2011. \n17.  Because of the ongoing administrative review process, IARCCA is not \nfiling a motion for injunctive relief concurrently with this notice.  It will not be until after the \n4 \nBDDB01 9010752v1 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-MJD   Document 94   Filed 11/30/11   Page 5 of 6 PageID #: 1780\n \nconclusion of the administrative review process – December 16 – that IARCCA's members will \nknow the full extent of their harm from the new rates.  IARCCA will file as soon as possible, \nkeeping in mind the need to give DCS appropriate time to respond to IARCCA's arguments.   \nRequest For Hearing \n18.  If the new rates go into effect, the Providers will be unable to care \nadequately for Indiana's most vulnerable children, as required by state and federal law. \n19.  Assuming the parties are not able to reach any other resolution, IARCCA \nanticipates filing an amended and supplemental complaint, seeking injunctive relief to prevent \nthe new rates from taking effect on January 1, 2012.  IARCCA anticipates filing that complaint \non or about December 7, 2011 and therefore requests that the Court set this matter for hearing \nbefore the end of December. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nBAKER & DANIELS LLP \n \nBy/s/April E.

Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 670, et seq., provides for\nfederal funds for the purposes offoster care and adoption assistance to states which have\nsubmitted, and approved, stateplans to the federal government.\n29. Indiana has submitted such plans, agreeing to be bound by the requirements of\nTitle IV-E, and has received the federal funding providedbyTitle IV-E.\n30. The Department of Child Services is the single state agency responsible for\nadministering the funds received under Title IV-E by the State ofIndiana. IND. CODE §\n31-25-2-8(a)(2).\n31. 42 U.S.C. § 672 provides for foster care maintenance payments on behalf of\neligible children who have been removed from relative homes and placed into foster care\nthrough a State agency, in Indianathe Department ofChild Services.\n32. The foster caremaintenance payments, defined by42 U.S.C. §675(4), are defined\nas, among other things, payments \"to cover the cost of(and the cost ofproviding) food,\nclothing, shelter, daily supervision, school supplies, a child's personal incidentals,\nliability insurance with respect to a child, and reasonable travel to the child's home for\nvisitation.\"\n33. 42 U.S.C. § 673 provides for adoption assistance payments to be made for special\nneeds children with the payments continuing after the child's adoption.\n34. Specifically, 42 U.S.C. §673(a)(3) provides that:\n(l)(A) Each State having a plan approved under this part shall enter into adoption\nassistance agreements (as defined in section 675(3) ofthis title) with the adoptive\nparents ofchildren with special needs.\n(B) Under any adoption assistance a!,rreement entered into by a State with parents\nwho adopt achild with special needs, the State-\n(i) shall make payments of nonrecurring adoption expenses incurred by or on\nbehalf of such parents in connection with the adoption of such child, directly\n6\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-MJD   Document 1    Filed 12/22/09   Page 7 of 12\nthrough the State agencyorthrough another public ornonprofit private agency, in\namounts determined underparagraph (3), and\n(ii) in any case where the child meets the requirements of paragraph (2), may\nmake adoption assistance payments to such parents, directly through the State\nagency or through another public or nonprofit private agency, in amounts so\ndetermined.\n* * *\n(3) The amount ofthe payments to be made in any case under clauses (i) and (ii)\nofparagraph (l)(B) shall be determined through agreement between the adoptive\nparents and the State or local agency administering the program under this\nsection, which shall take into consideration the circumstances of the adopting\nparents and the needs of the child being adopted, and may be readjusted\nperiodically, with the concurrence of the adopting parents (which may be\nspecified in the adoption assistance agreement), depending upon changes in such\ncircumstances. However, in no case may the amount of the adoption assistance\npayment made under clause (ii) of paragraph (l)(B) exceed the foster care\nmaintenance payment which would have been paid during the period ifthe child\nwith respect to whom the adoption assistance payment is made had been in a\nfoster family home.\n35. A child with special needs is defined by Indiana regulation, 465 lAC 2-7-2, to be\na child who meets the following criteria:\n(l) The county office offamily and children has determined that the child cannot\nor should not be returned to the horne ofthe child's parent or parents and that the\nparent or parents have signed or will sign a consent to adoption regarding the\nchild or that parental rights have been or will be terminated by a court in\naccordance with IC 31-35.\n(2) One (1) ofthe following conditions exists:\n(A) The child is two (2) years ofage orolder.\n(B) The child is a member ofa sibling group oftwo (2) ormore children ofwhich\nat least one (1) is two (2) years of age or older and who will be placed with the\nsibling group in the same home.\n(C) The child has a medical condition or physical, mental, or emotional disability\nas determined by a physician licensed to practice in Indiana or another state or\nterritory.\n7\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-MJD   Document 1    Filed 12/22/09   Page 8 of 12\n(3) Reasonable but unsuccessful efforts must be made to place the child in an\nappropriate adoptive home without providing adoption assistance. Reasonable\nefforts include, but are not limited to, the following:\n(A) Photo listing the child with the Indiana adoption resource exchange for a\nminimum ofsix (6) months.\n(B) Inability to recruit appropriate, interested adoptive parent or parents who are\nable to meet the child's needs without the use ofadoption assistance.\nReasonable efforts need not be made to place the child without adoption\nassistance ifto do so would be against the best interests ofthe child because of\nsuch factors as the existence of significant emotional ties with prospective\nadoptive parents while in the care ofsuchparents as a foster child.\nFactual allegations\n36. In December of2009, defendant Payne sent notices to all persons receiving foster\ncare payments as foster parents or adoption assistance payments as adoptive parents that\ntheir monthly payments would be reduced 10%, effective January 1,2010. The notice is\nattached as Exhibit 1.\n37. On information and belief this planned reduction is because of budgetary\nconstraints and is not the product ofany individual assessment ofthe families receiving\nthe payments or any assessment ofthe general costs ofproviding care for the children in\nquestion and whetherthose costs have decreased by 10% since the beginning of2009.\n38. In fact, defendant Payne engaged in no such individual assessment prior to\nimposing the reduction and the cost ofliving and providing care for the children in Class\nBand D has not decreased since 2008.\n39. S.H. #1, S.H. #2, A.H. and RH., are children adopted by C.H. and R.H.\n40. The children were adopted after being found to be Children in Need of Services\nand beingmade wards ofthe state.\n8\n\n..\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-MJD   Document 1    Filed 12/22/09   Page 9 of 12\n41. Because ofthe children's situations they are special needs children under Indiana\nlaw.\n42. Therefore, at the time of their adoptions, which occurred prior to December 31,\n2009, C.H. and R.H. entered into an agreement with the Department of Child Services\nthat the Department would provide the children a monthly adoption assistance payment.\n43. That payment has beenprovided and is used by C.H. and R.H. to care and provide\nfor the children.\n44. Additionally, C.H. and R.H. are the foster parents ofJ. J. #1, J.J. #2, and J.J. #3\nand receive monthly foster care assistance from the Department ofChild Services for the\ncare and maintenance ofthe children.\n45. C.H. and R.H. have now received Exhibit 1, informing them that their payments\nwill decrease 10% effectiveJanuary 1, 2010.\n46. No individual assessment has been done to determine if the children's expenses\nhave decreased. In fact they have not and the loss of 10% ofthe payments will make it\nmuch more difficult C.H. and R.H. to provide for the children.\n47. N.M.S. and N.J.S. are the adoptive children ofD.S. and T.S. The adoption was\ncompleted priorto January 1,2010.\n48. Prior to their adoption the children were wards of the Department of Child\nServices afterbeing found to be Children in Needs ofServices.\n49. Because ofthe children's situations, they are special needs children under Indiana\nlaw and therefore, at the time ofthe adoption, D.S. and T.S. entered into an agreement\nwith the Department ofChild Services that the Department would provide the children a\nmonthly adoption assistance payment.\n9\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-MJD   Document 1    Filed 12/22/09   Page 10 of 12\n50. That payment has been provided and is used by D.S. and T.S. to care and provide\nfor the children.\n51. D.S. and T.S. have now received Exhibit 1 and have been infonned that the\nadoption assistance payment will be cut 10% effective January 1, 2010.\n52. None ofthe adoptive parents have agreed or consented to the 10% reduction in\ntheirmonthly adoption assistance payments.\n53. No individual assessment has been done to detennine ifthe children's expenses\nhave decreased. In fact they have not and the loss of 10% ofthe payments will make it\nmuch more difficult for D.S. and T.S. to provide for the children.\n54. The actions and inactions ofdefendant are causing plaintiffs irreparable harm for\nwhich there is no adequate remedy at law.\n55. Afall times defendant has acted undercolorofstate law.\nLegal claims:\nFor ClassesA andB:\n56. Defendant's actions in unilaterally reducing foster care maintenance payments for\n10% solely because ofbudgetary concerns, without a proper methodology, and without\ntaking into consideration any of the cost factors noted in 42 U.S.c. § 675(4), and the\nindividual circumstances of foster parents and children in foster care, violates the\nrequirements ofTitle IV(E), 42 U.S.C. § 672(a) and 42 U.S.C. § 675(4), which require\nthat these foster care payments be suflicient to cover the cost of (and the cost of\nproviding) food, clothing, shelter, daily supervision, school supplies and a child's\npersonal incidentals, amongother costs.\n10\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-MJD   Document 1    Filed 12/22/09   Page 11 of 12\n57. Defendant's actions in unilaterally reducing foster care maintenance payments\n10% reduces thepayments below the level where they will cover the cost of(and the cost\nof providing) food, clothing, shelter, daily supervision, school supplies and a child's\npersonal incidentals, among other costs and therefore violate the requirements of Title\nIV(E), 42 U.S.c. §672(a) and 42 U.S.c. §675(4).\nFor Classes CandD:\n58. The unilateral and non-consensual 10% reduction of adoption assistance\npayments violates the explicit terms ofTitle IV-E, 42 U.S.C. § 673(a)(3), which states\nthat the amount ofsuch payments \"may be readjusted periodically, with the concurrence\nof the adopting parents\" and to the extent that the reduction is based on the unlawful\nreduction offoster carepayments, it is similarly unlawful.\n59. The unilateral and non-consensual 10% reduction of adoption assistance\npayments, solely because ofbudgetary concerns, violates the explicit term ofTitle IV-E,\n42 U.S.C. § 673(a)(3), which states that such payments must \"take into consideration the\ncircumstances ofthe adopting parents and the needs ofthe childbeing adopted.\"\nRequest for relief\nWHEREFORE, plaintiffs request that this Court:\na. Accept jurisdiction of this cause and set it for hearing at the earliest\nopportunity.\nb. Certifythis case as a class action with the classes as defined above.\nc. Declare that defendant has violated federal law for the reasons noted\nabove.\nd.

This reduction will begin with yournextpayment forthe\nmonth ofJanuary 2010.\nIn arrivingat these decisions, we consideredmany factors in addition tothe need to reduceoverallprogram expenses.\nThosefactors include ananalysis ofcurrentcosts and acomparison ofIndiana's foster care rates to those ofotherstates.\nIndiana's standard foster careperdiem, afterthe 10%reduction, stillremains among the highestin the United States.\nWhile itis oflittle comfort in these stressful times, pleaseknow thatyouarenot alone. Like othergovernmentagencies\nand business entities, DeS has spent countless hours trying to find ways to reduce expenses. These have been incredibly\ndifficultdeliberations and everyone involvedrecognizes the magnitudeofthedecisions beingmade. We understand the\nstress involved and we appreciate yourcontinued commitmentto children. DeS will evaluate the foster careperdiem\nrates and adoption payments as economicconditions warrant.\nI am confidentwewill get through these difficult times by partneringtogether. DeS remains committed to ourmission to\nprotectIndiana's abused and neglected children and to partnerwith you and others to provide safe, nurturing and stable\nhomes for ourchildren.

The State of Indiana, through the Department of Child Services, receives money \nfrom the federal government through Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § \n670, et seq., under which, among other things, monthly payments in the form of foster \ncare assistance and adoption assistance are given to, respectively, foster parents and \nadoptive parents.  Defendant, the director of the Department of Child Services, has \nrecently enacted a 10% reduction in these payments, effective in January of 2010.  These \nreductions violate federal law and are unlawful. \n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-MJD   Document 21    Filed 01/10/10   Page 2 of 13\nJurisdiction, venue, cause of action \n2.

Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 670, et seq., provides for \nfederal funds for the purposes of foster care and adoption assistance to states which have \nsubmitted, and approved, state plans to the federal government. \n  5\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-MJD   Document 21    Filed 01/10/10   Page 6 of 13\n29.  Indiana has submitted such plans, agreeing to be bound by the requirements of \nTitle IV-E, and has received the federal funding provided by Title IV-E. \n30.  The  Department  of  Child  Services  is  the  single  state  agency  responsible  for \nadministering the funds received under Title IV-E by the State of Indiana.  IND. CODE § \n31-25-2-8(a)(2). \n31.  42 U.S.C. § 672 provides for foster care maintenance payments on behalf of \neligible children who have been removed from relative homes and placed into foster care \nthrough a State agency, in Indiana the Department of Child Services. \n32.  The foster care maintenance payments, defined by 42 U.S.C. § 675(4), are defined \nas, among other things, payments “to cover the cost of (and the cost of providing) food, \nclothing,  shelter,  daily  supervision,  school  supplies,  a  child’s  personal  incidentals, \nliability insurance with respect to a child, and reasonable travel to the child’s home for \nvisitation.” \n33.  42 U.S.C. § 673 provides for adoption assistance payments to be made for special \nneeds children with the payments continuing after the child’s adoption.  \n34.  Specifically, 42 U.S.C. § 673(a)(3) provides that:  \n(1)(A) Each State having a plan approved under this part shall enter into adoption \nassistance agreements (as defined in section 675(3) of this title) with the adoptive \nparents of children with special needs.  \n \n(B) Under any adoption assistance agreement entered into by a State with parents \nwho adopt a child with special needs, the State—  \n(i) shall make payments of nonrecurring adoption expenses incurred by or on \nbehalf of such parents in connection with the adoption of such child, directly \nthrough the State agency or through another public or nonprofit private agency, in \namounts determined under paragraph (3), and  \n(ii) in any case where the child meets the requirements of paragraph (2), may \nmake adoption assistance payments to such parents, directly through the State \nagency or through another public or nonprofit private agency, in amounts so \ndetermined. \n  6\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-MJD   Document 21    Filed 01/10/10   Page 7 of 13\n \n*  *  * \n \n(3) The amount of the payments to be made in any case under clauses (i) and (ii) \nof paragraph (1)(B) shall be determined through agreement between the adoptive \nparents  and  the  State  or  local  agency  administering  the  program  under  this \nsection, which shall take into consideration the circumstances of the adopting \nparents  and  the  needs  of  the  child  being  adopted,  and  may  be  readjusted \nperiodically,  with  the  concurrence  of  the  adopting  parents  (which  may  be \nspecified in the adoption assistance agreement), depending upon changes in such \ncircumstances. However, in no case may the amount of the adoption assistance \npayment  made  under  clause  (ii)  of  paragraph  (1)(B)  exceed  the  foster  care \nmaintenance payment which would have been paid during the period if the child \nwith respect to whom the adoption assistance payment is made had been in a \nfoster family home. \n \n35.  A child with special needs is defined by Indiana regulation, 465 IAC 2-7-2, to be \na child who meets the following criteria: \n(1) The county office of family and children has determined that the child cannot \nor should not be returned to the home of the child's parent or parents and that the \nparent or parents have signed or will sign a consent to adoption regarding the \nchild  or  that  parental  rights  have  been  or  will  be  terminated  by  a  court  in \naccordance with IC 31-35.  \n \n(2) One (1) of the following conditions exists:  \n \n(A) The child is two (2) years of age or older.  \n \n(B) The child is a member of a sibling group of two (2) or more children of which \nat least one (1) is two (2) years of age or older and who will be placed with the \nsibling group in the same home.  \n \n(C) The child has a medical condition or physical, mental, or emotional disability \nas determined by a physician licensed to practice in Indiana or another state or \nterritory.  \n \n(3) Reasonable but unsuccessful efforts must be made to place the child in an \nappropriate adoptive home without providing adoption assistance. Reasonable \nefforts include, but are not limited to, the following:  \n \n(A) Photo listing the child with the Indiana adoption resource exchange for a \nminimum of six (6) months.  \n \n  7\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-MJD   Document 21    Filed 01/10/10   Page 8 of 13\n(B) Inability to recruit appropriate, interested adoptive parent or parents who are \nable to meet the child's needs without the use of adoption assistance.  \n \nReasonable  efforts  need  not  be  made  to  place  the  child  without  adoption \nassistance if to do so would be against the best interests of the child because of \nsuch  factors  as  the  existence  of  significant  emotional  ties  with  prospective \nadoptive parents while in the care of such parents as a foster child.  \n \nFactual allegations \n \n36.  In December of 2009, defendant Payne sent notices to all persons receiving foster \ncare payments as foster parents or adoption assistance payments as adoptive parents that \ntheir monthly payments would be reduced 10%, effective January 1, 2010.  The notice is \nattached as Exhibit 1. \n37.  On  information  and  belief  this  planned  reduction  is  because  of  budgetary \nconstraints and is not the product of any individual assessment of the families receiving \nthe payments or any assessment of the general costs of providing care for the children in \nquestion and whether those costs have decreased by 10% since the beginning of 2009. \n38.  In  fact,  defendant  Payne  engaged  in  no  such  individual  assessment  prior  to \nimposing the reduction and the cost of living and providing care for the children in Class \nB and D has not decreased since 2008. \n39.  S.H. #1, S.H. #2, A.H. and B.H., are children adopted by C.H. and R.H. \n40.  The children were adopted after being found to be Children in Need of Services \nand being made wards of the state. \n41.  Because of the children’s situations they are special needs children under Indiana \nlaw. \n  8\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-MJD   Document 21    Filed 01/10/10   Page 9 of 13\n42.  Therefore, at the time of their adoptions, which occurred prior to December 31, \n2009, C.H. and R.H. entered into an agreement with the Department of Child Services \nthat the Department would provide the children a monthly adoption assistance payment. \n43.  That payment has been provided and is used by C.H. and R.H. to care and provide \nfor the children. \n44.  C.H. and R.H. have now received Exhibit 1, informing them that their payments \nwill decrease 10% effective January 1, 2010. \n45.  No individual assessment has been done to determine if the children’s expenses \nhave decreased.  In fact they have not and the loss of 10% of the payments will make it \nmuch more difficult for C.H. and R.H. to provide for the children. \n46.  N.M.S. and N.J.S. are the adoptive children of D.S. and T.S.  The adoption was \ncompleted prior to January 1, 2010. \n47.  Prior  to  their  adoption  the  children  were  wards  of  the  Department  of  Child \nServices after being found to be Children in Needs of Services. \n48.  Because of the children’s situations, they are special needs children under Indiana \nlaw and therefore, at the time of the adoption, D.S. and T.S. entered into an agreement \nwith the Department of Child Services that the Department would provide the children a \nmonthly adoption assistance payment. \n49.  That payment has been provided and is used by D.S. and T.S. to care and provide \nfor the children. \n50.  D.S. and T.S. have now received Exhibit 1 and have been informed that the \nadoption assistance payment will be cut 10% effective January 1, 2010. \n  9\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-MJD   Document 21    Filed 01/10/10   Page 10 of 13\n51.  No individual assessment has been done to determine if the children’s expenses \nhave decreased.  In fact they have not and the loss of 10% of the payments will make it \nmuch more difficult for D.S. and T.S. to provide for the children.  \n52.  H.K. is the foster parent of S.D. and C.W., who are both wards of the Department \nof Child Services after being found to be Children in Need of Services.   \n53.  As  such,  H.K.  receives  foster  care  maintenance  payments  directly  from  the \nDepartment of Child Services on behalf of both S.D. and C.W. \n54.  No individual assessment has been done to determine if the children’s expenses \nhave decreased.  In fact they have not and the loss of 10% of the payments will make it \nmuch more difficult for H.K. to provide for the children. \n55.  H.K. has now received Exhibit 1, informing her that her payments would decrease \n10% effective January 1, 2010. \n56.  None of the adoptive parents have agreed or consented to the 10% reduction in \ntheir monthly adoption assistance payments. \n57.  With the 10% reduction in foster care maintenance payments, these payments are \ninsufficient to cover the cost of (and the cost of providing) the foster children’s food, \nclothing,  shelter,  daily  supervision,  school  supplies,  a  child’s  personal  incidentals, \nliability insurance with respect to a child, and reasonable travel to the child’s home for \nvisitation. \n58.  The actions and inactions of defendant are causing plaintiffs irreparable harm for \nwhich there is no adequate remedy at law. \n59.  At all times defendant has acted under color of state law. \nLegal claims: \n  10\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-MJD   Document 21    Filed 01/10/10   Page 11 of 13\n  For Classes A and B: \n60.  Defendant’s actions in unilaterally reducing foster care maintenance payments for \n10% solely because of budgetary concerns, without a proper methodology, and without \ntaking into consideration any of the cost factors noted in 42 U.S.C. § 675(4), and the \nindividual  circumstances  of  foster  parents  and  children  in  foster  care,  violates  the \nrequirements of Title IV(E), 42 U.S.C. § 672(a) and 42 U.S.C. § 675(4), which require \nthat  these  foster  care  payments  be  sufficient  to  cover  the  cost  of  (and  the  cost  of \nproviding)  food,  clothing,  shelter,  daily  supervision,  school  supplies  and  a  child’s \npersonal incidentals, among other costs. \n61.  Defendant’s actions in unilaterally reducing foster care maintenance payments \n10% reduces the payments below the level where they will cover the cost of (and the cost \nof providing) food, clothing, shelter, daily supervision, school supplies and a child’s \npersonal incidentals, among other costs and therefore violate the requirements of Title \nIV(E), 42 U.S.C. § 672(a) and 42 U.S.C. § 675(4). \n  For Classes C and D: \n62.  The  unilateral  and  non-consensual  10%  reduction  of  adoption  assistance \npayments violates the explicit terms of Title IV-E, 42 U.S.C. § 673(a)(3), which states \nthat the amount of such payments “may be readjusted periodically, with the concurrence \nof the adopting parents” and to the extent that the reduction is based on the unlawful \nreduction of foster care payments, it is similarly unlawful. \n63.  The  unilateral  and  non-consensual  10%  reduction  of  adoption  assistance \npayments, solely because of budgetary concerns, violates the explicit term of Title IV-E, \n  11\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-MJD   Document 21    Filed 01/10/10   Page 12 of 13\n42 U.S.C. § 673(a)(3), which states that such payments must “take into consideration the \ncircumstances of the adopting parents and the needs of the child being adopted.” \nRequest for relief \n  WHEREFORE, plaintiffs request that this Court: \na.   Accept jurisdiction of this cause and set it for hearing at the earliest \nopportunity. \n \nb.   Certify this case as a class action with the classes as defined above. \n \nc.   Declare  that  defendant  has  violated  federal  law  for  the  reasons  noted \nabove. \n \nd.  Enter a preliminary injunction, later to be made permanent, enjoining the \ndefendant’s  planned  10%  reduction  in  foster  care  and  adoption  assistance \npayments. \n \ne.   Award plaintiffs their costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. § 1988. \n \nf.   Award all other proper relief. \n \n                _/s/ Gavin M.

The cases at bar have been\nconsolidated for pretrial proceedings.  A hearing was held on January 20, 2010, at which\nthe parties presented evidence and oral argument.  Having considered the parties’\nbriefing, the documentary and testimonial evidence, and oral arguments, the Court orally\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-JMS   Document 48    Filed 01/26/10   Page 2 of 38\nsummarized from the bench at the conclusion of the hearing its conclusions.  For those\nreasons, as well as the additional reasons detailed below, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’\nmotions for injunctive relief.\nFactual and Procedural Background1\nA. C.H., et al. v. Payne\nOne group of Plaintiffs represents themselves and four classes of litigants\nconsisting of foster parents and foster children directly receiving foster care maintenance\npayments from the Indiana Department of Child Services (“DCS”) and adoptive parents\nand adopted special needs children directly receiving adoption assistance payments from\nDCS (“Class Action Plaintiffs”).  Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 670,\net seq. (“Title IV-E”), provides federal funding for the purposes of foster care and\nadoption assistance to states which have submitted state plans to the federal government\nand have had them approved.  The State of Indiana has submitted such a plan which has\nbeen approved and, thus, has agreed to be bound by all of the federal requirements under\nTitle IV-E.  DCS, headed by Director James Payne, is the state agency which administers\nthe Title IV-E monies provided by the federal government.\n1 Although these cases have been consolidated for pretrial proceedings, the facts\npertaining to each case, while similar, embody many important differences.  Accordingly, we\nsummarize the facts of each case separately.\n2\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-JMS   Document 48    Filed 01/26/10   Page 3 of 38\nUnder Title IV-E, the federal government underwrites a set percentage of the\nState’s expenses which are allowable and reimbursable under federal law.2  The funds\nused to provide the non-federal share of the Title IV-E expenses come from state-\nappropriated funds.  Prior to January 1, 2009, county tax levies and funds were used for\nthis purpose.  However, effective January 1, 2009, Indiana’s law changed, so that now\nonly state money is used to match the federal IV-E funds. \nFoster care maintenance payments are funds paid directly by DCS to DCS-licensed\nfoster parents (among other persons and entities), who are caring for or supervising\nchildren who have been removed from the homes of their relatives and are wards of DCS. \nIf a child is eligible to receive foster care maintenance payments,3 the State is required to\npay an amount sufficient to “cover the cost of (and the cost of providing) food, clothing,\nshelter, daily supervision, school supplies, a child’s personal incidentals, liability\ninsurance with respect to a child, reasonable travel to the child’s home for visitation, and\nreasonable travel for the child to remain in the school in which the child is enrolled at the\ntime of placement.”  42 U.S.C. § 675(4)(A).  DCS agrees that foster care maintenance\n2 The reimbursement rate is set prior to each federal fiscal year by the federal\ngovernment.  This rate has risen in each of the last three fiscal years, from 62.69% in fiscal year\n(“FY”) 2008, to 64.26% in FY 2009, and 65.93% in FY 2010.  In February 2009, the federal\nstimulus bill raised the reimbursement rate an additional 6.2% for expenses incurred from\nOctober 1, 2008 through December 31, 2010.  Thus, the current reimbursement rate is 72.13%.  \n3 To be eligible for foster care maintenance payments, the child, among other\nrequirements, must have met the eligibility requirements for the former Aid to Families with\nDependent Children in the month of his or her removal from the home.  See 42 U.S.C. §\n672(a)(2).\n3\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-JMS   Document 48    Filed 01/26/10   Page 4 of 38\npayments must cover all the reasonable costs of each of the items listed above.  These\npayments are paid as a per diem each month for the prior month’s services.  Therefore,\nthe monthly payment made on January 1, 2010, was for services rendered in December\n2009.\nAdoption assistance payments paid under Title IV-E are paid to eligible special\nneeds children4 and include one-time, non-recurring payments for costs such as attorneys’\nfees for the adoption.  Such assistance also includes continuing monthly payments for the\nchildren until they are at least eighteen years of age or are no longer receiving support\n4 In Indiana, a “special needs child” is defined as follows:\n(1)  The county office of family and children has determined that the child cannot or\nshould not be returned to the home of the child’s parent or parents and that the\nparent or parents have signed or will sign a consent to adoption regarding the\nchild or that parental rights have been or will be terminated by a court in\naccordance with IC 31-35.\n(2)  One (1) of the following conditions exist:\n(A)  The child is two (2) years of age or older.\n(B) The child is a member of a sibling group of two (2) or more children of\nwhich at least one (1) is two (2) years of age or older and who will be\nplaced with the sibling group in the same home.\n(C) The child has a medical condition or physical, mental, or emotional\ndisability as determined by a physician licensed to practice in Indiana or\nanother state or territory.\n(3) Reasonable but unsuccessful efforts must be made to place the child in an\nappropriate adoptive home without providing adoption assistance.  Reasonable\nefforts include, but are not limited to, the following:\n(A) Photo listing the child with the Indiana adoption resource exchange for a\nminimum of six (6) months.\n(B) Inability to recruit appropriate, interested adoptive parent or parents who\nare able to meet the child’s needs without the use of adoption assistance.\n465 Ind. Admin. Code 2-7-2.\n4\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-JMS   Document 48    Filed 01/26/10   Page 5 of 38\nfrom the adoptive parents.  The statute provides that the amount of the adoption\nassistance payments “shall be determined through agreement between the adoptive\nparents and the State . . . which shall take into consideration the circumstances of the\nadopting parents and the needs of the child being adopted, and may be readjusted\nperiodically, with the concurrence of the adopting parents (which may be specified in the\nadoption assistance agreement), depending upon changes in such circumstances.”  42\nU.S.C. § 673(a)(3).  Under federal law, adoption assistance payments cannot exceed the\nfoster care maintenance payment which would have been paid had the adopted child been\nin foster care.  Id.  As with foster care maintenance payments, adoption assistance\npayments are paid prospectively (i.e., the January 1, 2010 payment was for the month of\nDecember 2009).\nThe federal government does not direct the specific amounts of the payments; each\nstate determines the amounts of its own payments.  From 2006 until the payment incurred\nfor services beginning January 1, 2010, the standard per diem for foster care maintenance\npayments for children not requiring special needs or therapeutic foster care was $25 per\nday.  However, on January 1, 2009, when the State of Indiana assumed responsibility for\nthe rates, DCS undertook to reexamine the rate structure and determined that the rates\nneeded retooling.   In an attempt to arrive at a reasonable rate for payment, DCS engaged\nin a benchmarking process which included a comparison of Indiana payments to other\nstates’ rates.  \n5\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-JMS   Document 48    Filed 01/26/10   Page 6 of 38\nAs part of this review, DCS also relied heavily on a 2008 report from the United\nStates Department of Agriculture entitled “Expenditures on Children by Families”\n(“USDA Report”), which contains data on the actual expenditures made by all categories\nof parents for various categories of items for their children.  In that report, the data is\nseparated by age of child, income level of the family, size of the family, and general\ngeographic area.  The USDA report is not specifically focused on foster children, and,\nthus, includes certain expenses that are not part of the foster care rate, such as mortgage,\nrent, health care, and various education costs, but also excludes some expenses which are\nparticular to the care of children in foster care, including traveling costs incurred for visits\nto the foster child’s biological family.5  As part of its process of rate determination, DCS\nbegan with the amount of the total expenditures listed in the report for children aged\nfifteen to seventeen who were living in the lowest income group in the geographical\nregion titled “the Urban Midwest” and deducted from that amount expenditures deemed\nto be non-reimbursable under Title IV-E, such as health care, education, and child care\nexpenditures.6  Using that amount, DCS divided by a factor of 365 (days in a year) to\nreach a per diem of $20.68.7\n5 Evidence was adduced to establish that the cost of providing necessary essentials for a\nfoster child was, on average, significantly higher than the costs associated with raising children\nnot in foster care, due to the fact that many children in foster care suffer from emotional,\nbehavioral, or developmental problems.\n6 Although DCS removed education and child care expenditures from its calculation,\nsome expenses within those categories are in fact reimbursable under Title IV-E. \n7 The USDA Report indicated that in families with only one child the expense figure\n(continued...)\n6\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-JMS   Document 48    Filed 01/26/10   Page 7 of 38\nDCS also examined a 2006 nationwide report concerning foster care per diem rates\nentitled “Hitting the M.A.R.C. – Establishing Foster Care Minimum Adequate Rates for\nChildren” (“the M.A.R.C. Report”).  This report sets M.A.R.C.’s, or “minimum adequate\nrates for children” for three age-groups of children for each state.  Although the M.A.R.C.\nReport focuses on foster children, it does not include the costs of transporting such\nchildren for visits with family or the costs of childcare for working parents, some of\nwhich are reimbursable expenses under Title IV-E.  The 2006 figures disclose that\nIndiana’s foster care reimbursement rate was among the highest in the country per the\nM.A.R.C. Report.  At that same time Indiana’s rates were above the M.A.R.C. for two-\nand nine-year-old children, but below the M.A.R.C. for the sixteen-year-old group.  \nBased on its analysis of these reports, DCS concluded that Indiana’s foster care\nmaintenance payments needed to be reduced, and in late fall of 2009 DCS announced an\nacross-the-board ten percent (10%) reduction in those payments, which reduced the per\ndiem rate from $25 to $22.50.  This is the amount scheduled to be paid beginning\nFebruary 1, 2010, for foster care maintenance services rendered in January 2010.8   This\nfigure, while above the amount reached using calculations based on the USDA Report, is\nbelow the 2006 M.A.R.C., both with regard to the nine- and sixteen-year-old age groups. \n(...continued)\nshould be multiplied by a factor of 1.25 to reflect a more reasonable amount.\n8 At some point before DCS instituted the ten percent reduction in foster care\nmaintenance payments, the State Budget Agency had requested that DCS set aside a reserve of\nanother ten percent of its funds for reversion back to the State.\n7\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-JMS   Document 48    Filed 01/26/10   Page 8 of 38\nHowever, according to Douglas Weinberg, Deputy Director and Chief Financial Officer\nof DCS, even after the ten percent reduction, Indiana’s payments still rank as the fifth-\nhighest of all the states in the country.  Prior to reaching its decision to impose this cut,\nDCS made no attempt to contact foster care parents who were receiving such payments to\ninquire as to the impact of any reductions in the current per diem rate or to otherwise\nsolicit public comment or input.  \nWith regard to adoption assistance payments, as with foster care maintenance\npayments, the federal government does not impose any requirements on states as to the\nexact amount of the payments to recipients, but provides only that those payments not\nexceed the foster care per diem if the child were in foster care.  Thus, in Indiana, the 2009\nadoption assistance per diem was set at seventy-five percent (75%) of the $25 per day\nfoster care rate, that is, $18.50.  Defendants contend that duly promulgated Indiana\nregulations require that the adoption assistance payments not exceed seventy-five percent\nof the per diem rate for foster care maintenance payments.9  See 465 Ind. Admin. Code 2-\n7-3.  Thus, in reducing the amount of the adoption assistance rates to correlate with the\nreductions in the reduced foster care maintenance rates, DCS set the 2010 adoption\nassistance per diem at seventy-five percent of the reduced foster care rate of $22.50, that\nis, $16.88.  Again, at no point during the process of rate readjustment did DCS confer\n9 Plaintiffs contend that the State may, and does, pay above that percentage while still\nobtaining Title IV-E reimbursement for its expenditures, provided that the adoption assistance\nper diem does not exceed the foster care rate as provided by federal law.\n8\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-JMS   Document 48    Filed 01/26/10   Page 9 of 38\nwith the adopting parents regarding the impact of these reductions on their specific\ncircumstances and the needs of their adoptive children. \nCurrently, according to the documentary evidence, there are more special needs\nchildren awaiting adoption than there are prospective adoptive parents, and the reduction\nin adoption assistance rates has prompted some possible adoptive parents to decide not to\nadopt children.  Affidavit of Carolyn Thurston ¶ 3.  Various Plaintiff class members also\ntestified that the ten percent reduction in foster care maintenance payments will almost\ncertainly affect both their ability to cover the costs of the basic necessities for their\nchildren as well as to provide for their more specialized needs.\nThe total amount of State money saved annually by the 10% reductions in the\nfoster care maintenance and adoption assistance payments is approximately $10 million. \nThe major part of these savings comes in adoption assistance payments because more\nchildren are receiving these payments than receive foster care maintenance payments.\nB. The Indiana Association of Residential Child Care Agencies, Inc. v. \nThe Indiana Department of Child Services\nPlaintiff, the Indiana Association of Residential Child Care Agencies, Inc.\n(“IARCCA”), is an Indiana non-profit corporation representing approximately 110\nagencies.  IARCCA’s members provide a variety of services to Indiana families and\nchildren, including residential care and foster care placement services, for which they\nreceive varying rates of reimbursement from DCS.  Title IV-E provides that, for\ninstitutions such as IARCCA’s members, foster care maintenance payments “shall include\n9\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-JMS   Document 48    Filed 01/26/10   Page 10 of 38\nthe reasonable costs of administration and operation of such institution” as are necessarily\nrequired to provide the other items enumerated in § 675(4)(A), including: food, clothing,\nshelter, daily supervision, etc.\nIARCCA’s members provide services to two categories of clients that are relevant\nto this lawsuit:  Residential treatment service providers (“Residential Providers”), who\nprovide residential treatment for children in need of various developmental, mental,\nemotional, and educational services and Licensed Child Placing Agencies (“Placement\nProviders”), who focus on placement of children into foster care and/or adoptions.  Some\nproviders provide both residential and placement services.  Children are placed with\nproviders via referrals from DCS, juvenile courts and county probation departments, the\nIndiana Department of Education and the Indiana Bureau of Developmental Disabilities.\nDCS has Residential Treatment Services Provider Contracts (“Residential\nContracts”) with each Residential Provider which set forth the standards, terms, and\nconditions applicable to child caring institutions licensed under Indiana statutes and\noperating under DCS licensing regulations in providing residential care and treatment\nservices to children.  The Contracts require Residential Providers to provide basic\nnecessities, such as food and shelter as well as other treatment and services necessary to\naddress the problems of abuse and neglect their children have suffered.  Some treatments\nexceed the DCS per diem rate, but the rate is designed to cover many services and\nprograms beyond the provision of basic necessities.\nLicensed Child Placing Agency Contracts (“LCPA Contracts”) entered into by the\n10\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-JMS   Document 48    Filed 01/26/10   Page 11 of 38\nindividual Placement Providers and DCS went into effect on January 1, 2010.  Prior to\nthat date, a statewide master contract had not been in effect for Placement Providers.  The\nLCPA Contracts contain the standards, terms, and conditions applicable to child placing\nagencies operating under Indiana statutes and pursuant to DCS licensing regulations in\nproviding child welfare services, including placement of children for adoption, foster\ncare, or residential care.  The children served under these contracts do not reside with the\nPlacement Provider; they are placed in foster care and supervised by the Placement\nProvider.  \nThe Residential Contracts and LCPA Contracts do not specify the rates that DCS\nwill pay for the services described therein nor do they enumerate any criteria on which\nthe rates will be based.  Providers are notified of the rates that DCS will pay when they\nreceive their Individual Child Placement Agreements (“ICP Agreements”).  The Providers\nreceive an ICP Agreement tailored to each child under their care or supervision.  These\nagreements include more individualized information than contained in the master\nResidential or LCPA Contracts, including information regarding the specific services that\neach child is to receive.  Because the rates provided by the State for each child differ\ndepending upon the types of services each receives, the Providers are advised of the\nspecific reimbursement rates for the categories of services which they provide only at the\ntime they receive the ICP Agreements.\nAfter DCS assumed responsibility for the rate-setting and payment responsibilities\neffective January 1, 2009, it assessed the reasonableness and fairness of the rates then\n11\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-JMS   Document 48    Filed 01/26/10   Page 12 of 38\nbeing paid by the State to Residential and Placement Providers.  Mr. Weinberg testified\nthat, upon review of the rates paid to Residential Providers, DCS discovered that there\nexisted a significant disparity in payments received among the individual Providers for\nwhat appeared to be similar programs and services.10  In order to attempt to better\nunderstand these disparities, in April 2009, DCS Director James Payne sent a letter to\nResidential Providers requesting proposed rate-setting information.  DCS requested\ndetailed program descriptions and budgetary information from the Residential Providers,\nbut even after a careful review of the information submitted, DCS could not provide a\nreasonable rationale for the rate differences.  \nOn the basis of these data, Mr. Weinberg testified that DCS consulted a number of\nResidential Providers in an attempt to justify the differences in the proposed rates. \nThereafter, Mr. Weinberg concluded that the overall rate structure needed to be\n“compressed” in order to achieve more consistency among the varying amounts of\npayments made to Providers for similar services.  He testified that those Residential\nProviders who were on the higher end of the rate scale could reasonably be expected to\nabsorb rate reductions without incurring a significant detrimental impact on the quality of\ncare they could provide, given that they could also develop other revenue sources (i.e.,\ncharitable solicitations and fundraising) and improve their inefficiencies in administering\ntheir funding.\n10 According to Mr. Weinberg, in certain cases the rates paid to some Providers were five\ntimes higher than the rates paid to other Providers for what appeared to be similar programs and\nservices.\n12\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-JMS   Document 48    Filed 01/26/10   Page 13 of 38\nIn October 2009, DCS informed Residential Providers by letter that the rates they\nwere scheduled to receive in 2010 to cover the same services they provided in 2009\nwould be decreased by as much as ten percent.  However, this reduction would not be\nimposed uniformly among Providers: Residential Providers on the lower end of the rate\nspectrum would receive less of a reduction than those Providers on the higher end; some\nwould receive no reductions at all.  The reductions ranged from zero to ten percent; thirty-\nfour percent of Residential Providers would receive no reductions and four percent would\nreceive the full ten percent cut.  This works out to an average reduction of four percent. \nDCS’s October 2009 letter to Residential Providers contained no detailed explanation of\nthe manner in which any of these rate reductions was calculated.  A separate, subsequent\nletter to Residential Providers informed them that they could request reviews of possible\n“technical errors” with their respective rates, but again did not explain either how DCS\nhad arrived at the specific rates or how a Provider might know whether a rate was in\nerror, or, for that matter, how to lodge an appeal.  \nMr. Weinberg testified that, in October 2009, he had expected DCS to conduct\nsimilar reviews in 2010 of the 2011 rates, opining that the rate structures in place when\nthe State assumed responsibility for the payments were so out of kilter that more time\nthan a single year would be necessary to sort everything out.  However, based on existing\nbudgetary concerns, the effective dates of the proposed rate reductions were accelerated.\nOn November 30, 2009, therefore, the Residential Providers were sent another letter by\nDCS informing them that their rates were to be reduced across the board by an additional\n13\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-JMS   Document 48    Filed 01/26/10   Page 14 of 38\nfour percent.  The effect of this reduction was to lower some Providers’ rates for certain\nservices beneath the Title IV-E levels.  The November 30, 2009 letter also stated that the\nreduction “must be applied to all [ICP Agreements] that are currently in existence for\nchildren that are currently in placement as of the date of this letter and/or [ICP\nAgreements] that are entered into between now and January 1, 2010.”  Exh. Attached to\nAffidavit of Cathleen Graham (“Graham Aff.”) at 96 (November 30, 2009 Letter)\n(emphasis in original).  DCS further notified Residential Providers of its intent to\nterminate their Residential Contracts effective January 4, 2010, “in the event you choose\nnot to accept such a rate reduction.”  Id.  Thus, unless a Residential Provider accepted the\ncontract containing the rate reduction, no contract would be in place between DCS and\nthat Residential Provider as of January 4, 2010.  \nBeginning in mid-summer of 2009, DCS undertook a similar review of the rates\npaid to the Placement Providers.  As discussed above, in order to standardize payment\nrates for the services provided by Placement Providers throughout the State, a master\ncontract was created.  The proposed rate information solicited by DCS from Placement\nProviders did not contemplate payment for behavioral therapy or counseling services\nbecause those services were not covered under Title IV-E.  Those services accordingly\nwere unbundled from the proposed rates, but Mr. Weinberg testified that even with their\nseparation out of the calculations, the average rate proposed by the Placement Providers\nwas forty percent higher than the 2008 Title IV-E reimbursement rate and, further, as was\ntrue among the Residential Providers, large variations existed among the rates proposed\n14\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-JMS   Document 48    Filed 01/26/10   Page 15 of 38\nby the Placement Providers for similar services.\nIn an effort to address these rate disparities, DCS convened a rate workgroup,\nwhich included certain Placement Providers who were members of IARCCA.  According\nto Mr. Weinberg, rather than adopt a state-wide rate, these representatives of the\nPlacement Providers requested rate compression as a solution.11  Thus, in late November\nor early December 2009, DCS sent letters to all Placement Providers notifying them of\nrate reductions ranging from zero to twenty percent,12 with an overall average reduction\nof eight percent.  According to Mr. Weinberg, approximately twenty-three percent of the\nprograms received no reduction and approximately six percent received the maximum\nreduction.  DCS also subsequently informed the Placement Providers of an additional\nacross-the-board 6.3% reduction in their contract rates.13 \nThis notice of reductions allowed Residential Providers a mere ten days (that is,\nuntil December 14, 2009) and Placement Providers a mere sixteen days (that is, until\nDecember 20, 2009) to decide whether to sign their individual contracts and thereby\n11 Plaintiffs deny that they ever made such a request.  When asked on cross-examination,\nMr. Weinberg could not recall the names of any specific individual or individuals who proposed\nthe compression idea.\n12 Because the rates did not increase in 2009, this represents a twenty percent reduction in\nthe Providers’ 2008 rates.\n13 This additional reduction was based on DCS’s determination that about sixty-three\npercent of the LCPA contract rate represented the pass through per diem to the foster parent for\nmaintenance payments.  Thus, to reflect the ten percent reduction in the foster parents’ per diem\nrate, DCS reduced the Placement Providers’ contract rates the additional 6.3%.\n  \n15\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-JMS   Document 48    Filed 01/26/10   Page 16 of 38\naccept the reimbursement rate decreases.14  Mr. Payne informed the Providers by letter\nthat, if they did not accept the rate reductions by the designated deadline, DCS would\nneed to make arrangements to “transition [their] children to other providers.”  Exh.\nAttached to Graham Aff. at 99 (December 4, 2009 Letter).  In order to avoid the\npossibility of having the children whom they serve moved to another location or provider,\nbut also in an attempt to preserve their rights, many Providers who signed the contracts\nattached a “Reservation of Rights” form which provided in part as follows:\nThe rates of payment prescribed by this contract are inadequate and violate\nthe rights of the undersigned agency and the children placed under the\nagreement as established by federal law.  This agency is signing the\ncontract because of the Department of Child Services’ explicit statements\nthat failing to sign by a deadline 14 days after the contract was tendered\nwould result in termination of the agency as a provider and immediate\nrelocation of the children in its care, which would be contrary to the best\ninterests of those children.  This 14-day deadline is insufficient to allow the\nagency to determine whether it could continue to provide adequate care at\nthe reduced rate.  Signing this contract does not waive the agency’s right to\nchallenge the rates of payment as allowed by law.\nGraham Aff. ¶ 22.  On December 15, 2009, DCS informed IARCCA by letter that it\nviewed these Reservations of Rights submitted by the Residential Providers to be a “legal\nnullity” and repeated that the Residential Providers who had signed their contracts, even\nthose who had signed with a Reservation of Rights, would be paid according to the\n14 We were informed at the hearing that many providers are not-for-profit organizations\nwho are required by their bylaws to convene their boards of directors before making significant\nfinancial decisions or entering into contracts.  Plaintiffs contend that this accelerated time period\nwas wholly insufficient to allow them to schedule such meetings, let alone to analyze their\nbudgets and determine whether they could continue to provide the services they are contractually\nobligated to perform with the decreased rates, particularly since the deadline fell during the end-\nof-the-year holiday period.  Plaintiffs viewed this timetable as harsh and insensitive to their\ninterests and those they are seeking to serve.\n16\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-JMS   Document 48    Filed 01/26/10   Page 17 of 38\nreduced rates in effect beginning on January 1, 2010.  On December 17, 2009, however,\nDCS informed Placement Providers that all LCPA Contracts from Providers who had\nattached the Reservation of Rights to the contract would be rejected, and that, unless the\nReservation of Rights was asserted in a separate document, the Contracts would be\ndeemed invalid and DCS would subsequently discontinue future placements with and\npayments to those Providers.  Id. ¶¶ 23-24. \nFive Providers, all members of IARCCA, testified regarding the anticipated effects\nof the reductions in rates on their organizations.  According to their testimony, because of\nthe cuts many Providers will be forced to reduce staff, which is likely to affect both the\nchildren’s safety as well as the effectiveness and the adequacy of their therapeutic\nprograms.  Because the majority of children served by Residential and Placement\nProviders suffer from emotional, behavioral, and developmental problems, there is special\nneed for stable environments, individualized attention, and tailor-made therapies.  In turn,\nthe staff reductions will threaten the continuation of the Providers’ professional\naccreditations.  \nThe rate cuts also threaten to impact Providers’ ability to provide individualized\ntherapeutic services such as counseling, vocational programs, and placement of children\nin homes identified as suitable for meeting their specific needs.  For example, Joe\nHuecker, Director of Regional Youth Services, a Placement Provider with offices in\nJeffersonville, Evansville, and Madison, Indiana, testified that a number of the children\nserved by his organization have been reclassified by DCS from “special needs” foster\n17\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-JMS   Document 48    Filed 01/26/10   Page 18 of 38\ncare (which garners a higher reimbursement rate) to “traditional” foster care (which\ngarners a lower reimbursement  rate).  According to Mr. Huecker, a number of the\nchildren who were so reclassified unquestionably still require a special needs designation\ndue, for example, to a history of their inflicting sexual abuse on other children.  Such a\nclassification is necessary to ensure placement in a foster home suitable to their needs.  In\nMr. Huecker’s view, the reclassifications by DCS occurred as simply and foremost\nanother way (indeed, a disingenuous way) to reduce DCS’s overall costs. \n \nLegal Analysis\nI. Standard of Review\nThe grant of injunctive relief is appropriate if the moving party is able to\ndemonstrate: (1) a reasonable likelihood of succeeding on the merits; (2) irreparable harm\nif preliminary relief is denied; and (3) an inadequate remedy at law.  Girl Scouts of\nManitou Council, Inc. v. Girl Scouts of the United States of America, Inc., 549 F.3d\n1079, 1086 (7th Cir. 2008).  If the moving party fails to demonstrate any one of these\nthree threshold requirements, the emergency relief must be denied.  Id.  However, if these\nthreshold conditions are met, the Court must then assess the balance of harm – the harm\nto Plaintiffs if the injunction is not issued against the harm to Defendant if it is issued –\nand, where appropriate, also determine what effect the granting or denying of the\ninjunction would have on nonparties (the public interest).  Id. \n18\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-JMS   Document 48    Filed 01/26/10   Page 19 of 38\nIn determining whether to grant injunctive relief, the district court must take into\naccount all four of these factors and then “exercise its discretion ‘to arrive at a decision\nbased on the subjective evaluation of the import of the various factors and a personal,\nintuitive sense about the nature of the case.”  Id. (quoting Lawson Products, Inc. v. Avnet,\nInc., 782 F.2d 1429, 1436 (7th Cir. 1986)).  This process involves engaging in what is\ncalled the “sliding scale” approach, meaning that “the more likely it is the plaintiff will\nsucceed on the merits, the less balance of irreparable harms need weigh toward its side;\nthe less likely it is the plaintiff will succeed, the more the balance need weigh towards its\nside.”  Abbott Laboratories v. Mead Johnson & Co., 971 F.2d 6, 12 (7th Cir. 1992).  The\nsliding scale approach “is not mathematical in nature, rather ‘it is more properly\ncharacterized as subjective and intuitive, one which permits district courts to weigh the\ncompeting considerations and mold appropriate relief.’”  Ty, Inc. v. Jones Group, Inc.,\n237 F.3d 891, 895-96 (7th Cir. 2001) (quoting Abbott Laboratories, 971 F.2d at 12).\nII. Discussion\nA. The Likelihood of Success on the Merits:\n1. Private Cause of Action\nDefendants first contend that Plaintiffs do not have a likelihood of succeeding on\nthe merits of their federal claims because Title IV-E does not create rights enforceable\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983, foreclosing any private right of action.  Plaintiffs do concede that\nTitle IV-E, by its terms, does not expressly provide a private right of action for alleged\n19\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-JMS   Document 48    Filed 01/26/10   Page 20 of 38\nviolations of its terms and provisions.  However, Section 1983 “may supply a claim\nagainst state actors even when the underlying statute lacks express authorization of\nprivate litigation.”  McCready v. White, 417 F.3d 700, 703 (7th Cir. 2005) (citations\nomitted).  Section 1983 provides a remedy for violations of “rights, privileges, or\nimmunities secured by the Constitution and laws” of the United States.  In Gonzaga\nUniversity v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273 (2002), the Supreme Court made clear that the concept\nof “rights” differs from “broader or vaguer ‘benefits’ or ‘interests’” created by certain\nstatutes, and nothing “short of an unambiguously conferred right” supports a cause of\naction brought under § 1983.  Id. at 283.  Thus, “only statutes conferring rights on\nidentifiable persons may be enforced through § 1983.”  McCready, 417 F.3d at 703. \nPlaintiffs must also show that the right is framed in mandatory, rather than precatory\nterms, and that it is not so “vague and amorphous that its enforcement would strain\njudicial competence.”  Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329, 341 (1997). \nWhile the parties do not cite, nor has our research revealed, any Seventh Circuit\nauthority expressly addressing this issue, several courts in other jurisdictions have\npreviously addressed the issue of whether 42 U.S.C. § 672(a)(1) creates rights\nenforceable by foster parents and foster children under § 1983, and the majority of these\ncourts conclude that such rights are indeed created.  See California Alliance of Child &\nFamily Servs. v. Allenby [Allenby I], 459 F. Supp. 2d 919, 923-26 (N.D. Cal. 2006);\nMissouri Child Care Ass’n v. Martin, 241 F. Supp. 2d 1032, 1040-41 (W.D. Mo. 2003);\nKenny A. v. Perdue, 218 F.R.D. 277, 303 (N.D. Ga. 2003); California State Foster Parent\n20\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-JMS   Document 48    Filed 01/26/10   Page 21 of 38\nAss’n v. Wagner, 2008 WL 191283, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 22, 2008).  But see Carson v.\nHeineman, 240 F.R.D. 456 (D. Neb. 2007).  We agree with what we regard as these well-\nreasoned analyses. \nThe provision of the statute entitled “Foster Care Maintenance Payments Program”\nprovides in applicable part that “[e]ach State with a plan approved under this part shall\nmake foster care maintenance payments” with respect to particular foster children defined\ntherein.  42 U.S.C. § 672 (emphasis added).  “Foster care maintenance payments” are\n“payments to cover the cost of (and the cost of providing) food, clothing, shelter, daily\nsupervision, school supplies, a child’s personal incidentals, liability insurance with\nrespect to a child, and reasonable travel to the child’s home for visitation.”  42 U.S.C. §\n675(4)(A).  For institutional care, “such term shall include the reasonable costs of\nadministration and operation of such institution as are necessarily required to provide the\nitems described in the preceding sentence.”  Id.  \nThis language clearly and unambiguously confers a right to receive foster care\nmaintenance payments to individuals who have foster children who otherwise meet the\neligibility criteria.  The statute explicitly requires any State with an approved plan to\nprovide payments on behalf of eligible foster children to cover the specific costs listed in\n§ 675(4)(A).  In our view, the language contained in § 672(a)(1) is the type of rights-\ncreating language referenced in Gonzaga.  The right to reimbursement is couched in\nmandatory terms (providing that each State with an approved plan “shall” make foster\ncare maintenance payments) and is neither vague nor amorphous as the statute clearly\n21\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-JMS   Document 48    Filed 01/26/10   Page 22 of 38\nenumerates the items and services the payments are required to cover.  Thus, at least for\npurposes of ruling on Plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief, we conclude that a cause of\naction to enforce of this entitlement by foster parents is available under § 1983. \nMoreover, enforcement of this right by IARCCA is also proper because Title IV-E\ncontemplates payments directly to such providers.  42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(10).  \nThe statute mandating that adoption assistance payments be made, 42 U.S.C. §\n673(a)(3), is also enforceable through § 1983.  The statute provides in relevant part that\nthe amount of the payments “shall be determined through agreement between the\nadoptive parents and the State or local agency administering the program . . . which shall\ntake into consideration the circumstances of the adopting parents and needs of the child\nbeing adopted. . . .”  Id.  Furthermore, the statute provides that the amount of the payment\nmay only be readjusted “with the concurrence of the adopting parents.”  Id.  \nWe agree with the analysis incorporated by the Ninth Circuit in ASW v. Oregon,\n424 F.3d 970 (9th Cir. 2005), supporting its conclusion as excerpted below that § 671 and\n§ 673(a)(3) create rights enforceable by adopting parents and children:\nThis language [in § 673(a)(3)] evinces a clear intent to create a federal right. \nThe statutory text unambiguously requires the State to engage in an\nindividualized process with each family that takes into account their unique\nrequirements in determining the amount of their adoption assistance\npayments throughout the duration of their participation in the program. . .\n[T]hese particular statutory provisions are unambiguously framed in terms\nof the specific individual benefitted and contain explicit duty creating\nlanguage.\n22\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-JMS   Document 48    Filed 01/26/10   Page 23 of 38\nId. at 975-76 (internal citations omitted).  Thus, at least for purposes of ruling on\nPlaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief, we conclude that 42 U.S.C. § 673 is enforceable\nthrough § 1983.\n2. Associational Standing\nDefendants also challenge IARCCA’s standing to sue in this litigation.  IARCCA\ndoes not allege that it directly sustained any injury to itself; rather, it seeks to assert\nclaims for the alleged injuries to its members.  “[A]n association has standing to bring suit\non behalf of its members when: (a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in\ntheir own right; (b) the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization’s\npurpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the\nparticipation of individual members in the lawsuit.”  Hunt v. Washington State Apple\nAdvertising Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977).  \nIn deciding this issue, we see that clearly the first prong of this test is met here\nbecause, for the reasons detailed in Part II(A)(1), supra, where we have determined that\nindividual Providers have standing to challenge the rates that DCS proposes to pay for the\nservices they are providing.  Regarding the second prong, this action to require DCS to\ncomply with state and federal law in setting the reimbursement rates it will pay to\nProviders is consistent with IARCCA’s concurrent, independent interest in establishing\nand maintaining an appropriately high quality of care for children and their families. \nFinally, the third prong of the test is satisfied because the relief sought by IARCCA is\n23\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-JMS   Document 48    Filed 01/26/10   Page 24 of 38\ninjunctive or declaratory, which will inure to the benefit of all of its members who stand\nto suffer direct injury by violations of federal law.  See Retired Chicago Police Ass’n v.\nCity of Chicago, 7 F.3d 584, 602-03 (7th Cir. 1993).  Accordingly, we hold that IARCCA\nis a permissible and proper plaintiff in this action, insofar as it seeks injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief on behalf of itself and its members.\n3. Class Action Plaintiffs\na. Foster Care Maintenance Payments\n Federal law as previously cited provides that foster care maintenance payments\n“must cover the cost of (and the cost of providing)” the enumerated items, including food,\nclothing, shelter, etc.  42 U.S.C. § 675(4)(A).  DCS does not dispute the clear meaning of\nthis statutory language, to wit, that the payments provided must cover the total actual cost\nof the specified, covered items.  See California Alliance of Child & Family Servs. v.\nAllenby [Allenby II], ___ F.3d. ___, 2009 WL 4755730, at *3 (9th Cir. Dec. 14, 2009)\n(“[B]ecause the [statute] leaves ‘cover’ unqualified, the common understanding is that it\nmust refer to meeting all the costs of food, clothing, shelter, etc.”).  Moreover, because\nTitle IV-E requires foster care maintenance payments to fully cover the items specified in\n§ 675(4)(A), it follows that the methodology used by the State to determine an\nappropriate foster care maintenance per diem must take into consideration the actual costs\nof providing the enumerated items.  See Martin, 241 F. Supp. 2d at 1045 (“At a minimum,\nthe State is obligated to have a process for determining rates that takes into account the\n24\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-JMS   Document 48    Filed 01/26/10   Page 25 of 38\nstatutory criteria mandated by [the statute]”) (citations omitted).  Based on the evidence\nadduced at the hearing and in the written documents submitted into the record, we find\nthat Plaintiffs have established a likelihood of succeeding in their proof that the reduced\nrate is insufficient to cover the actual costs of providing the required items or at least that,\nin determining the rate for the foster care maintenance payments, the State did not employ\na methodology that fully encompassed Title IV-E’s mandatory cost factors.  \nAt the hearing, Mr. Weinberg testified that in setting the rates DCS relied\nprimarily upon the USDA Report.  However, the appropriateness of DCS’s reliance on\nthat report is questionable because it measures the expenses of raising all children, not\nonly foster children or foster children specifically.  The USDA Report contains certain\nexpenses that are not reimbursable under Title IV-E and fails to consider other expenses\nthat are.  Moreover, evidence introduced establishes that, because foster children often\nhave emotional, behavioral, and/or developmental problems, the costs of providing basic\nnecessities such as clothing, food, and shelter are often significantly higher for foster\nparents.  In addition, the USDA Report’s figures represent actual expenditures by families\non various items rather than the reasonable cost of providing those items.  Further,\nbecause DCS relied on the figures for the lowest income group in its calculations, those\nnumbers are likely eschewed by the poverty of the recipients rather than reflecting what\nthe items actually cost in a setting not restricted by such impecunious circumstances.  In\ncomparison, the M.A.R.C. Report focuses on the Title IV-E expenses specific to foster\ncare children.  Following the across-the-board ten percent reduction, Indiana’s 2010\n25\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-JMS   Document 48    Filed 01/26/10   Page 26 of 38\nfoster care maintenance payments will fall well below the 2006 M.A.R.C. in two of the\nthree age-group classifications.15  Based on this evidence, establishing that the ten percent\nreduction in payments likely fails to “cover the costs” made mandatory by the statute’s\nrequirements, Plaintiffs have established a likelihood of succeeding on the merits on this\npart of their claim.     \nMoreover, because Title IV-E requires foster care maintenance payments to fully\ncover the items specified in § 675(4)(A), while the State is not required to use any\nparticular methodology to determine an appropriate foster care maintenance per diem, it is\nobligated to use a methodology that takes into consideration the actual costs of providing\nthe enumerated items.  See Martin, 241 F. Supp. 2d at 1045.  The methodology employed\nby DCS did not satisfy this requirement.  As discussed above, the USDA Report does not\nfocus on the needs of foster care children and does not account for certain expenses that\nare reimbursable under Title IV-E, such as transportation expenses for visits with\nbiological families, and certain education and child care expenses that DCS deducted\nfrom its calculation.  It is true, as Defendants point out, that the 2010 rate reached by DCS\n($22.50) is higher than the calculation it reached using only the figures in the 2008 USDA\nReport ($20.68), ostensibly to cover the costs not contemplated therein.  However, there\nis no evidence that DCS employed any particular methodology in determining that the\n15 The M.A.R.C. in Indiana was calculated in 2006 to be $630 per month for a two-year-\nold, $722 per month for a nine-year-old, and $791 per month for a sixteen-year-old.  Assuming\n30.4 days in a month (365/12), Indiana’s 2010 monthly reimbursement rate is $684 ($22.50 x\n30.4).  \n26\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-JMS   Document 48    Filed 01/26/10   Page 27 of 38\nadditional $1.82 would be sufficient to fully cover the cost of providing the Title IV-E\nitems for foster care children in Indiana.  Nor is there evidence that DCS ever consulted\nwith any of the foster parents affected by the rate reduction to determine whether the\nreduced per diem could still be expected to cover the mandatory items.\nIn addition, to the extent that budgetary concerns drove the decision to impose the\nuniform across-the-board ten percent reduction,16 rather than consideration of the specific\nfactors mandated by the statute, such a procedure is in our view inappropriate under Title\nIV-E.  The Court does not underestimate the pressures on the State to respond to the\nmyriad of demands to provide services and to do so in a fiscally realistic and responsible\nway.  The fact that the task of consolidating such a wide range of data with relatively\nlimited resources available to draw on and to inform these decisions is a difficult and\nchallenging one is a matter well understood and fully appreciated by this Court. \nHowever, budgetary concerns cannot excuse reliance on a methodology that does not\nencompass the mandatory cost factors set out in Title IV-E.  \nFor the foregoing reasons, we conclude that Plaintiffs will likely be able to show\nthat, in determining the 2010 rates for foster care maintenance payments, DCS did not\nemploy a methodology based on the statutory factors mandated in 42 U.S.C. § 675(4)(A),\nas required under Title IV-E.  That the reduced per diem is demonstrably insufficient to\ncover all of the Title IV-E costs is also the clear conclusion of the evidence adduced by\n16 As discussed above, DCS was instructed to reserve 10% of its budget and subsequently\ncut the foster care maintenance payments by the same percentage.\n27\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-JMS   Document 48    Filed 01/26/10   Page 28 of 38\nthe parties at this juncture.  Accordingly, we hold that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on\nthe merits of their claim that the State’s ten percent across-the-board reduction in foster\ncare maintenance payments violates Title IV-E.\nb. Adoption Assistance Payments\nThe section of Title IV-E governing adoption assistance payments, 42 U.S.C. §\n673(a)(3), explicitly requires, in determining the amount of the payments, the State to\n“take into consideration the circumstances of the adopting parents and the needs of the\nchild being adopted.”  In interpreting a State’s duty under this section, the United States\nDepartment of Health and Human Services has explained that:\nTitle IV-E adoption assistance is not based upon a standard schedule of\nitemized needs and countable income.  Instead, the amount of the adoption\nassistance payment is determined through the discussion and negotiation\nprocess between the adoptive parents and a representative of the State\nagency based upon the needs of the child and the circumstances of the\nfamily.  The payment that is agreed upon should combine with the parents’\nresources to cover the ordinary and special needs of the child projected over\nan extended period of time and should cover anticipated needs.\nU.S. Dep’t of Health and Human Servs., Child Welfare Policy Manual § 8.2D.4, Answer\nto Question 1, available at http://www.acf.hhs.gov/j2ee/programs/cb/laws_policies/laws/\ncwpm/policy_dsp.jsp?citID=54 (last visited January 25, 2010).  In our view, Plaintiffs will\nhave little difficulty in establishing that the uniform ten percent reduction made by DCS,\nreached without any consultation with adoptive parents, does not meet that statutory\nstandard.  \n28\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-JMS   Document 48    Filed 01/26/10   Page 29 of 38\nThis statutory requirement clearly requires a State to engage in an individualized\ndetermination of the payment amount based on the specific needs of the children being\nadopted.  See ASW, 424 F.3d at 976 (“[The text of 42 U.S.C. § 673(a)(3)] unambiguously\nrequires the State to engage in an individualized process with each family that takes into\naccount their unique requirements in determining the amount of their adoption assistance\npayments throughout the duration of their participation in the program.”).  It is undisputed\nthat DCS engaged in no such process here, instead simply acting to reduce the adoption\nassistance payments by ten percent to correspond with the reduction in the foster care\nmaintenance payments.  \nIn light of the clear mandate set out in § 673(a)(3) requiring the State to consider\nthe individual needs of adopting parents and children when setting and readjusting the\npayments, in our view, the only time an across-the-board cut of adoption assistance\npayments might be allowable under the statute would be in circumstances where a State’s\nadoption assistance payments exceed its foster care maintenance payments.  See 42\nU.S.C. § 673(a)(3) (“[I]n no case may the amount of the adoption assistance payment . . .\nexceed the foster care maintenance payment which would have been paid during the\nperiod if the child with respect to whom the adoption assistance payment is made had\nbeen in a foster family home.”).  However, there is no indication here that Indiana’s\nadoption assistance rates at any time exceeded those of the foster care maintenance\npayments, even when compared to the reduced 2010 rate.  After the ten percent reduction\n(assuming it is determined to be lawful), the 2010 foster care maintenance payment rate\n29\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-JMS   Document 48    Filed 01/26/10   Page 30 of 38\nwould be $22.50.  Because the 2009 adoption assistance rate was $18.75, well below even\nthe reduced foster care rate, we can find no justification for imposing a blanket reduction\nin the adoption assistance payments for 2010 without (at least) first consulting with\nadoptive parents and considering the individualized needs of the children being adopted.17 \nBecause DCS failed to consult or confer with adoptive parents or consider the specific\nneeds of their children before making the rate reduction decision, we find that Plaintiffs\nhave established a clear likelihood of success in establishing that this uniform ten percent\ncut in adoption assistance payments violates Title IV-E. \n4. Provider Plaintiffs\na. Title IV-E\nDefendants argue that there is no requirement under Title IV-E that a particular\nmethod be used by a State to determine the amount of its foster care maintenance\npayments, and thus, the method used by DCS to set the Providers rates, while maybe not\nthe method that the Providers wanted, is not violative of Title IV-E.  We agree that Title\n17 DCS contends that state regulations require that the adoption assistance payments in\nIndiana be no more than seventy-five percent of the foster care maintenance payments, and thus,\nthe ten percent cut in adoption assistance payments was required.  The applicable regulatory\nprovision provides: “The amount of the adoption assistance shall not exceed the [foster care] per\ndiem paid by any county department of public welfare in Indiana or seventy-five percent (75%)\nof the per diem paid by the placing county department of public welfare, whichever is greater.” \n465 IAC 2-7-3.  However, the county departments no longer perform this task since the State\ntook over child welfare costs, including adoption assistance payments, from counties on January\n1, 2009.  Moreover DCS has stipulated that, under certain circumstances, it has made adoption\nassistance payments in amounts equal to the foster care maintenance payment rate.\n30\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-JMS   Document 48    Filed 01/26/10   Page 31 of 38\nIV-E does not mandate that a State use any particular methodology in setting its rates and\nwe are not requiring such here.  However, as discussed in detail above, whichever method\nthe State chooses it must consider the mandatory cost factors enumerated in §\n675(4)(A).18  See Martin, 241 F. Supp. 2d at 1046 (“This Court is not holding that\nDefendants need a certain or particular methodology, just that the Defendants need a\nmethodology that considers the required factors.”).  The process employed by DCS does\nnot do so.  \nAt a minimum, federal law obligates a State to have a process for determining rates\nthat takes into account Title IV-E’s criteria.  Id. at 1042-44.  DCS’s 2010 rate-setting\nprocedure was primarily performed by Mr. Weinberg, whose tenure with the agency was\nless than a year, who had no knowledge of how the rates had been set before 2010, and\nwho did not follow any specific written procedure.  Beyond the letter informing them of\nthe 2010 rates, Providers were given no information to explain or justify the established\nrates or the criteria on which they were based.  Without a clear rate-setting method, there\nis no way to discern whether DCS considered the actual cost of the items Title IV-E\nrequires in determining foster care maintenance payments.  Based on Mr. Weinberg’s\ntestimony, the process utilized by DCS appears to have focused heavily (perhaps\nexclusively) on instituting consistency and compression of the Providers’ rates, as\nopposed to determining the actual costs of services.  The rate-setting process also appears\n18 Under Title IV-E, Providers are entitled to reimbursement for expenses such as\nrecruitment and training of foster parents, placement of children into foster care, case plan\ndevelopment and management, and certain administrative costs.\n31\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-JMS   Document 48    Filed 01/26/10   Page 32 of 38\nto have been almost entirely motivated and controlled by budgetary concerns as is clear\nfrom the fact that, less than a month after determining that some Providers merited no\ndecrease in their rates, DCS instituted additional across-the-board reductions applicable to\nall Providers.  As a result, following the rate reductions, certain Providers are now\nassigned rates below their Title IV-E claimable rates, even though their contracts with\nDCS require them to provide more services than the minimum required by Title IV-E. \nFor the reasons detailed above, we hold that IARCAA has a reasonable likelihood of\nsuccess in showing that the process used by DCS in determining the 2010 rates for\nProviders did not properly take into account the Title IV-E factors.\nb. Indiana Code 4-2219\nAs a State agency, DCS is subject to the rule-making provisions of Indiana Code\nArticle 4-22.  Under Indiana law, agency rules must be promulgated according to various\nstatutory procedures, including, inter alia: notice (Ind. Code § 4-22-2-23); solicitation of\npublic comment (Ind. Code § 4-22-2-23.1); notice of public hearing (Ind. Code § 4-22-2-\n24); and public hearing (Ind. Code § 4-22-2-26; 27).  A “rule” is defined as: “an agency\nstatement of general applicability that: (1) has or is designed to have the effect of law; and\n19 There is no Eleventh Amendment prohibition to our consideration of this issue because\nDefendants waived their immunity by removing this case to federal court on December 23, 2009. \nSee Lapides v. Board of Regents of Univ. Sys. of Georgia, 535 U.S. 613, 624 (2002)\n(“[R]emoval is a form of voluntary invocation of a federal court’s jurisdiction sufficient to waive\nthe State’s otherwise valid objection to litigation of a matter (here of state law) in a federal\nforum.”).\n32\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-JMS   Document 48    Filed 01/26/10   Page 33 of 38\n(2) implements, interprets, or prescribes: (A) law or policy; or (B) the organization,\nprocedure, or practice requirements of an agency.”  Ind. Code § 4-22-2-3(b).\nDefendants contend that DCS was not required to engage in formal rulemaking on\nrates because rate-setting is a contractual matter between DCS and each Provider. \nHowever, we find persuasive the IARCCA’s contention that the rate cut directive DCS\ninstituted was in the nature of a rule, and thus, subject to the statutory requirements\ngoverning rulemaking.  The rulemaking function “embraces an element of generality,\noperating upon a class of individuals or situations” and, rather than operating\nretrospectively, “the exercise of administrative rulemaking power looks to the future.” \nBlinzinger v. Americana Healthcare Corp., 466 N.E.2d 1371, 1375 (Ind. Ct. App. 1984)\n(citations omitted).  It is true that DCS initially imposed a range of rate reductions that\naffected Providers differently based on the services they provided and the amount of their\nprior reimbursement rates.  However, DCS subsequently instituted additional cuts of 4%\nand 6.3%, which have general applicability to the classes of Residential Providers and\nPlacement Providers, respectively, and which all Providers were required to accept if they\nwanted to continue to contract with DCS.  Such uniform action is a hallmark of rule-\nmaking.  In addition, these rate reductions apply prospectively, not retroactively, and are\napplied as though they had the effect of law because Providers who do not accept the\nreduced rate may neither contract with DCS nor obtain referrals from the State.  For these\nreasons, we conclude that the IARCCA is likely to be able to establish that the general\n33\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-JMS   Document 48    Filed 01/26/10   Page 34 of 38\nrate reductions instituted by DCS constitute rules and are thus subject to the provisions of\nIndiana Code Article 4-22.\nIt is undisputed that there is no statute or administrative rule in place explicating\nthe procedures used by DCS to set the Residential or LCPA rates.  Even after they\nreceived notice of the reduced rates, Providers were given no explanation for the chosen\nrates or the criteria on which they were based or the way in which an appeal could be\nlodged.  DCS failed to solicit public comment or to take action to ensure that the rate-\nsetting process was open and transparent and otherwise in compliance with the State of\nIndiana’s statutory requirements.  While the State clearly has both the prerogative and the\nresponsibility to determine overall funding levels, it may not operate within those\nboundaries in an arbitrary, or apparently arbitrary, fashion.  For these reasons, we find\nthat the IARCCA has a reasonable likelihood of prevailing on its state law claim.   \nB. Irreparable Harm and Inadequate Remedy at Law\nThe injuries that all categories of plaintiffs stand to suffer if an injunction is not\nissued are significant and the type for which there is no adequate remedy at law.  There is\nmuch more than money at issue in this case.  The evidence presented at the hearing and\nadduced from the record demonstrates that, absent a preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs are\nlikely to suffer a variety of substantial harms due to the rate cuts, including, inter alia: a\nreduction in the monies necessary for the provision of basic care and support for foster\nchildren and special needs adopted children; a reduction in the number of persons willing\n34\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-JMS   Document 48    Filed 01/26/10   Page 35 of 38\nto be adoptive or foster parents, leading to difficulties placing children in safe and\nsupportive environments; staffing cutbacks, resulting in the loss of necessary supervision\nand stability for children, many of whom have severe emotional and behavioral problems\nand require individualized treatment; reclassification of children for financial reasons,\nresulting in the loss of certain benefits for those children; and the deleterious transfer of\nchildren from their current, presumably safe and secure custodial arrangements.    \nIt is the quality of care promised to the children under the applicable statutes that is\nat stake in the case at bar.  Any deficiency in such care cannot later be undone with\nmonetary compensation.  See American Commercial Lines, LLC v. Northeast Maritime\nInstitute, Inc., 588 F. Supp. 2d 935, 949 (S.D. Ind. 2008) (Barker, J.) (“[L]egal remedies\nare inadequate if damages would be inadequate to relieve the wrong.”) (citations omitted). \nAccordingly, we find that Plaintiffs have met their burden to show that, in the absence the\npreliminary relief they seek, they will likely suffer irreparable harm for which there is no\nadequate remedy at law.  \nC. Balance of the Harms and the Public Interest\nThe balance of the harms also weighs in favor of granting a preliminary injunction\nin the case at bar.  We say again that, the current economic climate imposes enormous\nchallenges on the State’s ability to deliver on essential governmental services in the face\nof declining revenues.  As the same time, the financial burden that Plaintiffs are faced\nwith if Defendants are not enjoined from implementing the proposed rate reductions is no\n35\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-JMS   Document 48    Filed 01/26/10   Page 36 of 38\nless substantial or critical.  The implementation of the proposed funding cuts may be\nexpected to result in immediate reductions in care, housing, services, staffing,\nsupervision, and stability for some of Indiana’s most vulnerable citizens – the children\nwho are beneficiaries of the payments at issue.  When compared with the potential\nemotional upheaval and deprivation of basic necessities that the recipients of the funds\nare likely to suffer if a preliminary injunction is not granted, the balance of hardships\nclearly tips in Plaintiffs’ favor.  Moreover, the public interest is served by ensuring that\nthe statutes and regulations in place to provide for the safety and well-being of these\nparticularly vulnerable children are strictly followed by the governmental agencies named\nhere as defendants.\nD. Bond\nRule 65(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that: “The court may\nissue a preliminary injunction . . . only if the movant gives security in an amount that the\ncourt considers proper to pay the costs and damages sustained by any party found to have\nbeen wrongfully enjoined or restrained.”  Id.  However, the Seventh Circuit has\nrecognized that, “[u]nder appropriate circumstances bond may be excused,\nnotwithstanding the literal language of Rule 65(c).”  Wayne Chem., Inc. v. Columbus\nAgency Serv. Corp., 567 F.2d 692, 701 (7th Cir. 1977).  In light of the nature of the\nclaims at issue, which concern Plaintiffs’ ability to afford to provide basic necessities for\ntheir children or the children they serve, coupled with the hardship they would face if a\n36\n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-JMS   Document 48    Filed 01/26/10   Page 37 of 38\nbond were to be required, no bond shall be required to be posed by Plaintiff in this\ninstance.\nIII. Conclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ Motions for Preliminary\nInjunction.  Defendants, the Indiana Department of Child Services (“DCS”) and James\nW. Payne, Director, and all of their agents, servants, and employees, are hereby\nPRELIMINARILY RESTRAINED from:\n(1) reducing or otherwise altering any reimbursement rate to any licensed child\nplacing agency (“LCPA”) or residential placement provider in the Title IV-E\nprogram below the DCS rates being paid on August 1, 2009;\n(2) taking any action to circumvent this order, including but not limited to transferring\na child to a less expensive placement, reclassifying a child to a less expensive rate,\nor declining to assign a child to a more expensive placement, solely or primarily to\nreduce expenditures on the child; and\n(3) reducing or otherwise altering all foster care maintenance payments paid directly\nto foster parents and all adoption assistance payments paid to adoptive parents\nbelow the amounts being paid on December 31, 2009.  The State is therefore\nPRELIMINARILY ENJOINED from implementing or otherwise effectuating the\nplanned ten percent reduction in these payments, which was scheduled to go into\neffect on January 1, 2010, absent further order of this Court.\n  \nSaid PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION took effect at the conclusion of the hearing\non January 20, 2010, by order of the Court and shall remain in effect and extend until\nfurther order of the Court or, in any event, no later than a final ruling on the merits.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n \n      _______________________________ \n37\nDate:  01/26/2010         SARAH EVANS BARKER, JUDGE \n        United States District Court \n        Southern District of Indiana \n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-JMS   Document 48    Filed 01/26/10   Page 38 of 38\nCopies to:\nDavid S.

Payne (\"Payne\"), in his official capacity as director of DCS, Plaintiff, The Indiana \nAssociation of Residential Child Care Agencies, Inc. (\"IARCCA\"), states as follows: \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-MJD   Document 96   Filed 12/08/11   Page 2 of 16 PageID #: 1796\n \nBackground: The Parties \n1.  IARCCA is a non-profit corporation, incorporated and with its principal \nplace of business in Indiana, comprised of approximately 110 member agencies that provide \nresidential treatment, foster care and home-based services to abused, neglected and delinquent \nIndiana children and their families (\"Providers\"). \n2.  Approximately 80 of IARCCA's 110 members provide services that \ninclude a residential component (\"Residential Providers\").  Licensed Child Placing Agencies \n(\"LCPAs\") are focused on placing children in qualified foster care.  Some IARCCA members are \nboth Residential Providers and LCPAs.  IARCCA represents the interests of its members relating \nto DCS's contracts with IARCCA member agencies. \n3.  According to Ind. Code § 31-25-2-8, DCS is the single State agency \nresponsible for administering Title IV-E of the Federal Social Security Act (see 42 U.S.C. § 670 \net seq.) (\"Title IV-E\"). \n4.  Defendant Payne is Director of DCS. \nBackground: This Litigation  \n \n5.  DCS pays each Provider a per diem rate for each child, based on the types \nof services that the child will receive. \n6.  IARCCA initiated this action in December 2009 against DCS and Payne, \nin his official capacity as director of DCS, after DCS announced that it was cutting the rates that \nDCS pays to Providers that provide treatment to abused, neglected and delinquent Indiana \nchildren and their families.  IARCCA contended that the rate cuts were arbitrary and unlawful.1 \n                                                 \n1 IARCCA originally filed the case in Marion County Superior Court, and the Defendants \nremoved it, thereby waiving their Eleventh Amendment immunity.  C.H. v. Payne, 683 F. Supp. \n2d 865, 883 n. 19 (S.D. Ind. 2010) (“[R]emoval is a form of voluntary invocation of a federal \n2 \nBDDB01 9021946v1 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-MJD   Document 96   Filed 12/08/11   Page 3 of 16 PageID #: 1797\n \n7.  The Court entered a preliminary injunction enjoining DCS from \nimplementing the rate cuts that were proposed at that time.  Dkt. 49. \n8.  The parties entered into a settlement agreement in February 2011 for the \nresolution of all claims in the case. A true and accurate copy of the settlement agreement (with \nexhibits) is attached hereto as Exhibit A. \n9.  The settlement agreement required DCS to promulgate certain \nadministrative rules and a provider manual to govern the setting of the rates that DCS pays to the \nProviders, and to issue rates consistent with those rules.  Id. ¶ 2. \n10.  The settlement agreement also included agreement by the Providers to a \nfive percent across-the-board rate cut with certain exceptions.  Id. ¶ 1.  Exceptions were for \nProviders being paid less than their IV-E claimable rates, and for those Providers that are \nPsychiatric Residential Treatment Facilities (\"PRTFs\") to be paid at the Medicaid rate.  Id. \n¶ 1(a)-(c). \n11.  The settlement agreement \"[p]ermits either party to enforce any breach of \nthis Agreement or applicable law in this court, without having to exhaust administrative remedies \n. . . .\"  Id. ¶ 4(c). \nBackground: The New Rules and Rates \n12.  DCS filed the new rules on or about April 26, 2011 (for Residential \nProviders) and May 25, 2011 (for LCPA Providers).  See 465 IAC 2-16-1 et seq. (as to \nResidential Providers) and 2-17-1 et seq. (as to Placement Providers).   \n                                                                                                                                                             \ncourt's jurisdiction sufficient to waive the State's otherwise valid objection to litigation of a \nmatter (here of state law) in a federal forum.”) (quoting Lapides v. Board of Regents of Univ. \nSys. of Georgia,535 U.S. 613, 624 (2002)). \n3 \nBDDB01 9021946v1 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-MJD   Document 96   Filed 12/08/11   Page 4 of 16 PageID #: 1798\n \n13.  To assist it with rate setting as contemplated by the rules, DCS sought, and \nthe Providers submitted, cost reports on or about May 31, 2011.  Cost reports are reports \nprepared annually by each Provider describing the costs they incurred during the prior year in \nproviding services to their youth placements. \n14.  On October 17, 2011, DCS issued letters to Providers setting forth the \nrates that DCS would agree to pay beginning on January 1, 2012.  Dkt. 94, Ex. C (sample rate \nletter). \n15.  Months after the cost reports were due – and three days after the rates \nbased on those reports had been set – DCS published two provider manuals on or about \nOctober 20, and at that same time published Bulletins that set \"caps\" on rates.  The provider \nmanuals are attached hereto as Exhibit B; see also Dkt. 94, Ex. B (Bulletins).  While the rules \ncontemplated, in concept, some allowable maximums on certain categories of rates, the rules \nwere silent on what those maximums would be or how they would be calculated.  The Bulletins \nalso do not explain how the rate caps were calculated. \n16.  While the submission of cost reports was not new in 2011, the information \nin the provider manuals about how certain costs must be allocated and which were reimbursable \nconstituted significant changes from past practice.  Because they lacked the manuals and \nBulletins when cost reports were prepared, Providers understood belatedly that they had not \nnecessarily \"adhered\" to some of the new guidelines (of which they were not aware) in their cost \nreporting.  Nevertheless, DCS set rates based on the cost reports that had already been submitted, \nwithout an opportunity to revise them in accordance with the provider manuals. \n17.  The proposed 2012 rates represent drastic decreases to the amounts DCS \nhas historically paid to reimburse Providers for the services they provide – in some cases, DCS \n4 \nBDDB01 9021946v1 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-MJD   Document 96   Filed 12/08/11   Page 5 of 16 PageID #: 1799\n \nintends to cut rates by more than 50 percent.  The rate cuts for most Providers are significantly \ngreater than the cuts this Court previously enjoined in January 2010. \nDCS did not comply with the settlement agreement, its own new rules, or other applicable \nlaw in developing the new rates.   \n18.  DCS is a state agency subject to the rule-making provisions of Ind. Code \nArt. 4-22.  These requirements apply to all children in a State's foster care program, whether or \nnot they are financially qualified for funds administered under Title IV-E.2   \n19.  DCS is required, under Ind. Code Art. 4-22, to promulgate administrative \nrules that set forth a method by which DCS will set per diem reimbursement rates for Providers. \n20.  In the Bulletins it issued in October, DCS published \"Cost Caps\" that \nwould apply to various cost categories.  \n21.  As noted above, although the rules contemplate that reasonable ceilings \nwould be placed on certain costs, DCS set those ceilings outside of the rule-making process, in \nBulletins.  Providers had no input into those Bulletins, which were not subject to public \ncomment.  Thus, DCS has not promulgated administrative rules concerning the setting of rate \ncaps on the rates it will pay to Providers, yet it has calculated rates based on these caps.   And the \nexisting Rules do not specify what the caps will be, yet it has informed Providers that those caps \nwill apply across the board. \n                                                 \n2  For a state to receive funds under Title IV-E, the state must make foster care maintenance \npayments for qualified children, to cover the cost of food, shelter, clothing, daily supervision, \nschool supplies, personal incidentals, liability insurance and reasonable travel to the child's home \nfor visitation.  Federal law requires that the rates be sufficient to cover the costs of items \ndescribed in Title IV-E, including the administration costs involved with providing those items.  \nBy paying per diem rates to Providers, DCS receives federal matching funds to cover part of the \ncosts for the services outlined in Title IV-E to children in Indiana.  The rates paid by DCS to \nProviders also cover health-related, education-related and other services not covered by Title IV. \n5 \nBDDB01 9021946v1 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-MJD   Document 96   Filed 12/08/11   Page 6 of 16 PageID #: 1800\n \n22.  One such cap limits the amount of administrative costs DCS will \nreimburse, as a percentage of all costs.  And DCS has included in its definition of \n\"administrative\" costs several non-administrative functions, counting them against the cap.  465 \nIAC 2-16-3.  For example, the 2011 cost report format required that program management costs \n(including program directors, quality assurance, and case managers) be classified in the \nadministrative column. These are program costs that should not be subject to an “administrative” \ncap and lead to improperly low rates under DCS's own rules. \n23.  By contrast, the rules contemplate some additional allowance for \n\"indirect\" costs incurred by Provider.  Indirect costs are agency infrastructure-type costs, such as \nhuman resources staff, financial staff, management information systems, and recordkeeping.  \nDCS failed to include an allowance for indirect costs in its methodology and Bulletin, resulting \nin these costs being disallowed for Providers.  This is problematic because Providers are required \nto perform the tasks included in indirect costs, such as keep records, budget, conduct audits, \nadhere to personnel requirements and background checks, and have an administrative \ninfrastructure that supports the direct administration of programs. \n24.  In addition to being arbitrary, the capped rates fail to reimburse Providers \nfor certain costs that DCS requires Providers to incur, such as required staffing ratios needed to \nmaintain licensing. \n25.  DCS's failure to promulgate administrative rules concerning the setting of \nrate caps for Providers violates Ind. Code Art. 4-22. \nDCS has failed to adhere to its own administrative rules regarding rate setting. \n26.  As noted, DCS did promulgate rules for use in Provider rate-making.  But \nit has failed to adhere to them in setting Providers' rates. \n6 \nBDDB01 9021946v1 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-MJD   Document 96   Filed 12/08/11   Page 7 of 16 PageID #: 1801\n \n27.  For example, DCS is applying staff ratios in an unlawful manner.  \nLicensing regulations (see e.g. 465 IAC 2-9-48, 465 IAC 2-10-48, 465 IAC 2-12-48, and 465 \nIAC 2-13-48) require that child-caring institutions and group homes “employ staff to perform \nadministrative, supervisory, service, and direct care functions,” describing four separate, \nsegregated functions.  Yet despite this separation of supervisory staff from direct-case workers in \nDCS's own rules, DCS includes supervisors and case managers in the direct care staff ratio \ncalculations in the new rates, in violation of the licensing provisions.  In one instance, during the \nsame week a Provider's reimbursement for staff was cut, DCS licensing personnel informed that \nsame Provider that it needed additional staff to comply with DCS licensing rules under which the \nProviders are required to operate. \n28.  Approximately 80 percent of IARCCA's Provider members have filed \nrequests for administrative review with DCS, as provided for by the new rules.  DCS's responses \nto those requests are due on or about December 16, 2011. \n29.  DCS's proposed rates are set to go into effect on January 1, 2012.  Based \non the current billing and reimbursement system between DCS and Providers, they will \nexperience the impact of those cuts immediately in January. \n30.  DCS's proposed rates will have a negative effect on the children in the \nProviders' care.   \n31.  DCS's proposed rates will leave Providers with many unreimbursed costs.  \nSome of IARCCA's members have already had to close programs and lay off staff because of the \ncuts.  They are concerned that DCS's new staff ratios fail to provide for adequate supervision of \nchildren.  Several anticipate losing their accreditation. \n7 \nBDDB01 9021946v1 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-MJD   Document 96   Filed 12/08/11   Page 8 of 16 PageID #: 1802\n \n32.  Unless restrained by this Court, the DCS's arbitrary and unlawful \nreduction of reimbursement rates to Providers will cause irreparable harm to the children served \nby the Providers. \nCount I: Violation of Ind. Code Sec. 4-22 \n33.  DCS's failure to set rate caps according to promulgated rules violates Ind. \nCode Art. 4-22.  \n34.  The specific caps set by DCS, published only in \"Bulletins,\" were not \npromulgated in accordance with any stated or written rules or criteria – beyond the fact that the \nrules contemplated that there would be maximums set for certain types of costs. \n35.  IARCCA is entitled to declaratory relief that DCS's use of arbitrary caps \non per diem rates set other than pursuant to promulgated rules violates state law and to injunctive \nrelief restraining DCS from setting current rates except pursuant to promulgated rules. \nCount II: Violations of Indiana Administrative Code \n36.  DCS has violated its own rules in three principal areas: staff ratios, \nadministrative costs, and fringe benefits.  \n37.  First, in its Bulletins, DCS has set staffing ratios that do not comply with \naccreditation standards or even DCS's own licensing rules. \n38.  Many Providers are required to comply with accreditation standards to \nprovide services, which call for no less than 5:1 staffing ratio. \n39.  Licensing rules require Providers \"to employ a sufficient number of \nqualified persons to provide care and supervision for the children at all times.\"  DCS's staffing \nratios do not allow for children to be transported individually to school or counseling \nappointments and still sufficiently staff children who remain in the facility.  For some Providers, \n8 \nBDDB01 9021946v1 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-MJD   Document 96   Filed 12/08/11   Page 9 of 16 PageID #: 1803\n \nthey do not allow compliance with 465 IAC 2-9-58(f) and 59(b), which require a second person \nbe available to \"continuously maintain direct observation\" of a child being restrained or \nconfined.  Licensing rules require that facilities with three (3) or more children under the age of \neight (8) to maintain a 1:4 staff ratio.  DCS's new staffing ratios do not permit that.   \n40.  The staffing ratios are inconsistent with DCS's own licensing rules, \nbecause they include supervisors and case managers in the direct care staffing ratio calculations.  \nBut licensing rules require that Providers employ staff to perform \"administrative, supervisory, \nservice, and direct care functions,\" and provide that \"functions may be combined only upon the \napproval of the department.\"  See 465 IAC 2-9-48, 2-10-48, 2-12-48 and 2-13-48.  Furthermore, \nProviders must be fully compliant with their staffing ratios for the state to claim Title IV-E funds \nfor the children in their care.  Thus, if Providers adhere to DCS's staffing ratios, they put their \nown licenses and their Title IV-E eligibility in jeopardy. \n41.  Second, the Rules require that DCS cover \"reasonable costs related to \nadministration\" of Providers.  See 465 IAC 2-17-21(a).  But DCS, as announced in its Bulletin, \ncapped administrative costs at 20% of direct costs – without any regard to whether that \npercentage is reasonable.  That cap fails to cover several costs that are required under licensing \nrules.  Indiana's Rule includes costs associated with casework, case management, and quality \nassurance procedures.  See 465 IAC 2-16-3.  By capping allowable costs at an unreasonable \nnumber, DCS has effectively disallowed a range of costs that the Rule requires it to cover. \n42.  DCS has failed to allow for both indirect costs and direct administrative \ncosts, as required by the rules – instead simply setting a cap on administrative costs.  See 465 \nIAC 2-16-21(d)(5) and 2-17-23(d)(5) (disallowing costs exceeding \"any indirect cost allocations \nas a percentage of total costs in excess of the maximum percentage of total costs established by \n9 \nBDDB01 9021946v1 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-MJD   Document 96   Filed 12/08/11   Page 10 of 16 PageID #: 1804\n \nthe department for allowable indirect costs\") and (6) (disallowing costs exceeding maximum \npercentage of total administrative costs established by the department).  This violation is \nespecially egregious because DCS's cost report required that Providers list both direct and \nindirect administrative costs – leading Providers, reasonably, to expect that DCS would cover \ncosts in both categories.    \n43.  The cap that DCS chose for administrative costs also fails to cover several \ncosts that are required under the licensing statute and rules that apply to Providers. These include \ncosts to conduct a criminal history check for all employees and volunteers (required by Ind. Code \n31-27-3-3); costs to maintain personnel records (required by 465 IAC 2-9-44, 48); costs to \ndevelop a written plan for the orientation, training and development of staff (required by 465 \nIAC 2-9-54); and costs to develop and administer health programs (required by 465 IAC 2-9-69). \n44.  Finally, the rules require that DCS set a maximum allowable variation \nfrom the median fringe benefit rate for all Providers.  See 465 IAC 2-16-21(d)(2) and 2-17-\n23(d)(2).  DCS did not do that.  Instead, DCS capped the allowable fringe benefit at 25% of \nsalaries and payroll taxes.  This number is simply the mean fringe benefit as reported by \nProviders – it is not by any definition a range around the median, and it therefore violates DCS's \nown rule, and it by definition puts half of Providers over the cap. \n45.  DCS's failure to follow its own administrative rules has harmed Providers \nby negatively impacting their expected rates for 2012.  IARCCA is entitled to a declaration that \nDCS's actions violate their own regulations and injunctive relief precluding DCS from \ncontinuing those violations. \n10 \nBDDB01 9021946v1 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-MJD   Document 96   Filed 12/08/11   Page 11 of 16 PageID #: 1805\n \nCount III: Violation of Title IV-E \n46.  DCS's failure to set rates according to written criteria and methods violates \nTitle IV-E.  \n47.  The State’s rate caps violate Title IV-E because they fail to reimburse \nProviders for all the reasonable costs enumerated in Title IV-E, including “food, clothing, \nshelter, daily supervision, school supplies, a child’s personal incidentals, liability insurance with \nrespect to a child, reasonable travel to the child’s home for visitation, and reasonable travel for \nthe child to remain in the school in which the child is enrolled at the time of placement,” and \nreasonable administrative costs pertaining to those items.  42 U.S.C. § 675(4)(A). \n48.  Because of the arbitrary and still unexplained nature of the caps on \nadministrative costs, fringe benefits, and staffing, DCS cannot demonstrate its compliance with \nTitle IV-E, which requires reimbursements to cover all of these costs. \n49.  By eliminating its former process of calculating separate rates for each \nprogram and provider upon which it would claim federal reimbursement, and choosing instead to \nclaim reimbursement based only on the rates paid, DCS has designed a system that “leaves on \nthe table” potential federal reimbursement.  While DCS is not obligated to maximize federal \nreimbursement, eliminating the so-called IV-E claimable rate for each program and provider \neliminates the other method for measuring whether DCS has complied with the substantive \nrequirements of IV-E. \n50.  By failing to follow its own rate-making process, establishing arbitrary \ncaps, and eliminating its separate system for measuring IV-E compliance, Indiana has eliminated \nany way to demonstrate its compliance with Title IV-E.   \n11 \nBDDB01 9021946v1 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-MJD   Document 96   Filed 12/08/11   Page 12 of 16 PageID #: 1806\n \n51.  IARCCA is entitled to a declaration that DCS's actions violate Title IV-E \nand injunctive relief precluding DCS from cutting current rates without first demonstrating that \nthey cover all costs required by Title IV-E. \nCount IV: Breach of Settlement Agreement \n52.  The parties' settlement agreement provides that DCS will not \"amend or \nRepeal the Rules, or otherwise . . . effect any significant changes in the rate-setting process that \nare inconsistent with the method in the Rules, without IARCCA's consent, until two (2) years \nfrom the date the Rules are enacted.\"  Ex. A, ¶ 2. \n53.  By 1) failing to follow the rules that it did promulgate and 2) by adhering \nto rate caps that were set outside of the rules, DCS has violated its obligation not to effect \nchanges in rate setting that are significant and inconsistent with the Rules. \n54.  IARCCA's members have been harmed by DCS's violation of the \nsettlement agreement. \n55.   IARCCA is entitled to a declaration that DCS's actions violate the \nsettlement agreement and injunctive relief precluding DCS from cutting current rates without \nadhering to its terms. \nCount V: Violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n56.  The DCS's failure to follow its rules for rate setting violates Title IV-E. \n57.  Payne, in seeking to enforce reimbursement rates set arbitrarily, is acting \nunder color of state law and in violation of the requirements of Title IV-E.  This conduct further \nviolates 42 U.S.C. § 1983 because it is an action under color of state law that violates the rights \nunder federal statute of IARCCA and its member agencies. \n58.  Payne is liable to IARCCA's members for violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n12 \nBDDB01 9021946v1 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-MJD   Document 96   Filed 12/08/11   Page 13 of 16 PageID #: 1807\n \n59.  IARCCA is entitled to relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 including recovery of \nattorneys' fees incurred in bringing this action under 42 U.S.C. § 1988. \nWHEREFORE, IARCCA requests the Court: \n(a)  to enter declaratory judgment that DCS's setting of per diem rate payments to \nProviders other than pursuant to promulgated rules violates Indiana Code Art. 4-22; \n(b)  to enter declaratory judgment that DCS's cuts in per diem rate payments to \nProviders described in this Complaint violate Title IV-E of the Social Security Act; \n(c)  to enter declaratory judgment that DCS has breached its settlement agreement \nwith IARCCA by failing to follow its own rules in setting rates; \n(d)  to enter preliminary injunctive relief precluding DCS from reducing rates until it \nadheres to its rules governing the establishment of per diem rates; \n(e)  to enter permanent injunctive relief requiring DCS to set rates and to increase or \nreduce rates only in accordance with written standards promulgated in accordance with federal \nand state law; \n(f)  to enter preliminary and permanent injunctive relief precluding DCS from taking \nany action concerning any children in the care of Providers, based solely on decisions about the \nrates to Providers; \n(g)  to award IARCCA its damages according to proof; and \n(h)  to award IARCCA its costs, attorneys' fees and all other appropriate relief. \n   \n13 \nBDDB01 9021946v1 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-01574-SEB-MJD   Document 96   Filed 12/08/11   Page 14 of 16 PageID #: 1808\n \nBAKER & DANIELS LLP \n \n \n \nBy/s/Jon Laramore   \nJon Laramore, #17166-49 \nApril E.
