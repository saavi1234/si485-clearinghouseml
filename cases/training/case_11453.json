    "summary": "<p>On May 29, 2007, a fair housing focused nonprofit organization filed a lawsuit against the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1437(f) and 3608(e)(5) in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas.  Plaintiff, represented by private counsel, asked the court for injunctive relief, claiming that HUD should use smaller rental housing market areas, instead of large multi-county regions, as a basis for determining Fair Market Rents (\"FMRs\").  Specifically, plaintiff alleged that HUD's practice of using a large multi-county region as the starting point for determining FMR violated both 42 U.S.C. § 1437(f), which requires HUD to base FMRs on \"market area,\" and the Fair Housing Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. § 3601, et seq., which imposes an affirmative duty on HUD to promote fair housing policies.  </p><p>Under its housing subsidy programs, HUD contracted with local public housing agencies and private landlords to pay the difference between the FMR and the amount paid by the tenant (roughly 30% of the tenant's income.) The lower the FMR, the less likely it was for a low-income tenant to be able to find an affordable unit.</p><p>The \"market area\" used by HUD to determine FMRs in the Dallas rental housing market was comprised of eight counties.  HUD, however, applied rent levels calculated using a twelve-county region. Plaintiff alleged that this practice resulted in lower FMRs for the Dallas rental housing market area, thereby precluding the Housing Choice Voucher Program participants from obtaining rental housing in more affluent, Caucasian areas.</p><p>On October 2, 2007, defendant filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that plaintiff lacked standing and that plaintiff's claims were barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity.  </p><p>On September 29, 2009, the Court (Judge Reed O'Connor) granted defendant's motion on the ground of sovereign immunity with respect to plaintiff's claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1437(f), but denied the motion in all other respects.</p><p>On October 26, 2009, plaintiff amended its complaint and sought relief under 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a) and 42 U.S.C. § 3608(e)(5), arguing that the state's practice violated equal protection incorporated in the Fifth Amendment.  HUD filed their answer to the amended complaint a month later.  </p><p>The parties then appeared to enter into settlement negotiations. On May 4, 2010, the Court ordered the parties to submit a settlement by June 4th. When this deadline passed without a settlement agreement, the Court temporarily closed the case. It reopened the case in 2012 to officially dismiss the case after the parties apparently filed a settlement agreement. The agreement is not publicly available, and the case is now closed.</p><p></p>",

      "text": "Case 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 28      Filed 08/10/2009     Page 1 of 5\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nNORTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS\nDALLAS DIVISION\nThe Inclusive Communities Project, Inc., *\nPlaintiff, * Civil Action No.\nv. * 07-CV-945-O\nThe United States Department of  * ECF\nHousing and Urban Development, *\nDefendant. *\nPLAINTIFF’S BRIEF IN OPPOSITION TO HUD OBJECTIONS AND MOTION TO STAY\nPlaintiff opposes HUD’s objections to and motion to stay the U.S. Magistrate’s July 20,\n2009 order requiring HUD to provide plaintiff with the administrative record in the case. HUD\ncites some unspecified burden as the reason for the objections and the stay. There is no such\nburden. HUD’s attorney has admitted that the administrative record is already compiled. HUD\ncites numerous cases in support of its motion. Not one of the cases involves a decision on a\nmotion to stay the filing of an administrative record by a federal agency. HUD has not met its\nburden for overturning or staying the order to provide the administrative record. Since HUD has\nalready used the administrative record - as set out in self-serving affidavits by HUD employees -\nin its favor on the motion to dismiss and since HUD is clearly going to continue its efforts to\ndismiss the case, plaintiff will be prejudiced by an order staying the order to produce. HUD can\ncontinue to dip into the record at its convenience while plaintiff will have no access to the record\nfor the continuing dispute on the motion to dismiss.\nHUD could not specify a burden because there is none.\nHUD’s argument that an unspecified “burden” on it justifies its objections to and its\nrequest for a stay of the order requiring it to provide plaintiff with the administrative record upon\nwhich HUD relied by August 19, 2009. Defendant’s Objections, page 2. HUD does not state\n-1-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 28      Filed 08/10/2009     Page 2 of 5\nwhat this burden might be. If HUD was seeking to prevent discovery by asserting such an undue\nburden, it would have to provide more than such a “mere statement.” S.E.C. v. Brady, 238 F.R.D.\n429, 437 - 438 (N.D. Tex. 2006). HUD did not do so but rather rests its motion on the non-\nspecific objection that provides no basis for either a detailed response or for an order granting\nrelief based on the general objection. \nHUD cannot show that the order will impose any burden much less an undue burden.\nWhen HUD’s attorney first called plaintiff’s attorney after the U.S. Magistrate’s recommendation\nand accompanying orders were filed, the HUD attorney confirmed that the HUD administrative\nrecord had been compiled. Placing postage on a package or emailing electronic records is not an\nundue burden that would justify the exceptional relief of a stay of a order that HUD must admit is\nclearly within the discretion of the Court.\nHUD’s cases provide no basis for the stay other than the discretion of the Court.\nThe order to provide the plaintiff with the administrative record violates no statute,\nregulation, or court made principle. HUD’s objections and motion provide no such authority. The\ncases HUD cites do not involve the question of whether the provision of the administrative\nrecord should be stayed pending the final decision on a motion to dismiss. The Court of Claims\nroutinely decides motions to dismiss along with decisions based on the administrative record.\nFlowers v. U.S., 80 Fed.Cl. 201, 202, 227 (Fed. Cl. 2008); Barnick v. U.S., 80 Fed.Cl. 545, 546-\n547 (Fed.Cl. 2008). There is no legal requirement for the requested stay.\nIn addition to HUD not meeting its burden to show a stay is justified, such an order\nwould prejudice plaintiff by continuing HUD’s unilateral access to the administrative\nrecord.\nIf the analogy to discovery is followed, then the onus is on HUD to show that it is entitled\n-2-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 28      Filed 08/10/2009     Page 3 of 5\nto the requested stay. HUD has shown neither legal authority nor factual grounds for the stay. An\nadditional ground for denial of the motion is the prejudice to plaintiff caused by allowing HUD\nto continue to enjoy unilateral access to the administrative record even on the motion to dismiss.\nHUD’s objections to providing the Court and the plaintiff with the administrative record\nhave not kept HUD from using the administrative record on its own behalf. Although the\ndocuments in the record have not been filed or served, HUD has already filed two affidavits\ndiscussing the contents of the administrative record. HUD used the affidavits to support its\nmotion to dismiss. \nThe first affidavit citing to and relying upon the administrative record was the Declaration\nof Kurt G. Usowski in Support of Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Subject Matter\nJurisdiction, Document 9 filed 10/02/2007 (Usowski). Mr. Usowski was the Assistant Deputy\nAssistant Secretary for Economic Affairs responsible for supervising the development of the\nSection 8 voucher program fair market rents.  Usowski, page 1. His declaration described HUD’s\nprocess for establishing fair market rent areas in general and in the Dallas area. Usowski pages 2\n- 4. Mr. Usowski discussed HUD’s findings, HUD’s phone survey, HUD’s use of Census data,\nHUD’s use of the Consumer Price Index data, the basis for some changes to the fair market rent\nareas, HUD’s use of American Community Survey data, and HUD’s record for implementation\nof the market area for the determination of fair market rents in the Dallas area. Usowski,\nthroughout. HUD cited Usowski on HUD’s record for establishing fair market rent areas and fair\nmarket rents 21 times in its brief in support of its motion to dismiss. Defendant’s Motion to\nDismiss for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction; Accompanying Brief; Certificate of Interested\nPersons, 4 cites on each of pages 9, 11, 12; 2 cites on each of pages 10 and 27, one cite on each\n-3-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 28      Filed 08/10/2009     Page 4 of 5\nof pages 16, 18, 21, 25, and 28. Plaintiff had no access to the same administrative record used by\nHUD and Mr. Usowski.\nThe second affidavit citing to and relying upon the administrative record was the\nDeclaration of Donald L. Darling In Support of Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss for Lack of\nSubject Matter Jurisdiction, Document 17 filed 11/13/2007 (Darling). Mr. Darling was the HUD\nRegional Economist and had a role in setting Section 8 Fair Market Rents. Darling, page 1. Mr.\nDarling’s affidavit discussed meetings with Dallas Housing Authority, data submitted by the\nDallas Housing Authority, a HUD spreadsheet identifying racial composition and median rents\nfor census tracts in Dallas, Collin, Denton, and Tarrant Counties, and his records concerning\ncontacts with the Dallas Housing Authority. Darling pages 1 - 3. None of the records were\nproduced. HUD used the Darling declaration to deny that it was responsible for setting rents that\ndid not provide access to predominantly White areas. Defendant’s Reply In Support of Its Motion\nto Dismiss for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction, page 9 n.8.\nHUD asked for and received an extension of time to file its objections to the U.S.\nMagistrate’s Recommendation on the HUD motion to dismiss. The District Judge’s decision on\nthose objections will be de novo. Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(3). Even if HUD does not submit\nadditional material concerning the administrative record to the District Judge, it will be using its\nprevious record and arguments. Plaintiff will still have no access to the underlying administrative\nrecord upon which HUD relies for its motion to dismiss if the Court grants the stay. \nConclusion\nHUD has not shown that it is entitled to the stay on either the law or the facts. There is no\nlaw requiring the stay and HUD will suffer no burden in complying with the order. Without such\n-4-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 28      Filed 08/10/2009     Page 5 of 5\na showing, there is no basis to prejudice plaintiff by supporting HUD’s unilateral access to the\nadministrative record. Plaintiff asks the Court to exercise its discretion and deny the motion for a\nstay of the order requiring HUD to provide plaintiff with a copy of the administrative order by\nAugust 19, 2009 as ordered.\nRespectfully Submitted,\ns/ Michael M.

This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1331.\n2. The plaintiff Inclusive Communities Project (\"ICP\") is a fair housing focused non-\nprofit organization which works with families seeking to obtain and retain housing in\npredominately non-minority areas of the Dallas metropolitan area. This is part of ICP's work to\nbreak down barriers to the creation of racially and economically inclusive communities.\nSpecifically, ICP works with Black families participating in the Section 8 Housing Choice\nVoucher program (the \"Section 8 program\") administered by the U.S. Department of Housing\nand Urban Development (\"HUD\") and Dallas Housing Authority (\"DHA\"). ICP assists DHA\nSection 8 program families who choose to lease dwelling units in non-minority areas with\ncounseling and financial assistance. ICP's office is located in the City of Dallas, Dallas County,\nTexas.\n3. The defendant is the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development\n[HUD]. HUD is an executive agency of the United States of America. HUD is the federal\nadministrator of the Section 8 program.\n4. The Section 8 program is the federal government's major program for assisting very\nComplaint -1-\n\n•\nCase 3:07-cv-0S0945     Document 1      Filed 05/29/2007     Page 2 of 14\nlow-incomefamilies to find and pay for decent, safe, and sanitary housing in the private housing\nmarket. The Section 8 families pay at least 30% of their income for the gross rent for a unit.\nGross rent includes both the contract rent and the cost of the utilities for the unit. The Section 8\nsubsidy for the portion of the rent not paid by the Section 8 family is paid directly to the landlord.\nHUD is the federal agency responsible for administering the Section 8 program using federal\nfunds. DHA is a local agency responsible for administering the Section 8 voucher program.\n5.TheSection 8 program legislation requires HUD to establish the fair market rents for\nexisting or newly constructed rental dwelling units of various sizes and types in rental housing\nmarket areas. The market rents must be for units suitable for occupancy by persons assisted under\nthe program. 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o)(l)(B)incorporating 42 u.s.c. § 1437f(c)(1).The units\nsuitable for occupancy by persons assisted by Section 8 are referred to as \"standard quality, non-\nluxury housing.\" The fair market rental for standard quality, non-luxury housing is used to\ndetermine:\nA. whether or not a unit is eligible for any subsidy assistance, and\nB. if the unit is eligible for subsidy, the amount of the rent paid by the participant and the\namount of federal subsidy that can be paid on behalf of a Section 8 participant. 42 U.S.C. §\n1437f(o)(2),(3).\n6. DHA's Section 8 population is 86% Black and 6% White.\n7. The Section 8 families participating in DHA's Section 8 program are not restricted to\nunits in either the City of Dallas or Dallas County. As of October 1, 2006, DHA Section 8\nhouseholds.were living in the non-Dallas County cities or towns of Allen, Flower Mound, Frisco,\nHeath, Highland Village, McKinney, and Plano. As of October 1, 2006 there were 443 DHA\nComplaint -2-\n\n.\nCase 3:07-cv-00945     Document 1      Filed 05/29/2S007     Page 3 of 14\nSection8 households in Collin County and 270 DHA Section 8 households in Denton County.\n8. DHA is required to administer the Section 8 program for any eligible unit located by a\nDHA Section 8 participant in Collin, Dallas, Denton, Kaufman, Rockwall, Ellis, or Tarrant\ncounties.\n9. HUD is violating its obligation to set market area fair market rentals for the Dallas area\nSection 8 programs. Rather than use market areas to establish the fair market rental, HUD uses\nU.S. Census data for a 12 county region that is not a market area. The twelve counties are Collin,\nDallas, Delta, Denton, Ellis, Hunt, Kaufman, Johnson, Parker, Rockwall, Tarrant, and Wise.\n10. By selecting this multi-county region instead of the actual market areas, HUD is able\nto apply a formula that calculates the maximum rent for the Section 8 program in the Dallas area\nbased on the lower rents in predominantly minority markets where many of the neighborhoods\nare blighted and have inadequate public and private services and facilities. This ghetto area rent\nis then applied by HUD to establish the maximum rent that can be paid under the Section 8\nprogram in the higher rent predominantly White markets where there are few if any blighted\nneighborhoods and the public and private services and facilities are better than those in the\nminority blighted neighborhoods.\n11. The 12 county area is not a single rental housing market area. The 12 county area\nconsists of 8,990 square miles of land with 5,161,544 people. In fact, HUD sets three separate\nfair market rents for the area. Only the rent for the Dallas area is set using the 12 county region\ndata. HUD sets separate rent levels in the four counties of Johnson, Parker, Tarrant, and Wise\nbecause of its determination that those counties are two separate rent setting areas. Johnson,\nParker, and Tarrant counties are in one HUD rent setting area and Wise County is in a separate\nComplaint -3-\n\n.\nCase 3:07-cv-0S0945     Document 1      Filed 05/29/2007     Page 4 of 14\nrentsetting area. Despite HUD' s determination that these four counties are separate rent setting\nareas, forty percent (40%) of the units that HUD uses to calculate its rent levels for the Dallas\narea Section 8 program are in those four counties -Johnson,Parker, Tarrant, and Wise.\n12. HUD does not calculate the rent levels for Johnson, Parker, Tarrant, and Wise\ncounties using the rental units in the 12 county area. The FY 2007 Section 8 program rent levels\nfor the HUD Fort Worth rent area is calculated using only the units in Johnson, Parker, and\nTarrant County. The FY 2007 two-bedroom rent for these three counties in the Fort Worth rent\nArea is $745. The FY 2007 two-bedroom rent level for the HUD Wise County rent area is\ncalculated using only the units in Wise County. That rent is $546. The FY 2007 rent levels for\nthe eight county HUD Dallas rent area were calculated using the units in all twelve counties. The\nFY 2007 two-bedroom rent for the Dallas area is $798.\n13. HUD applies the rent levels calculated using the 12 county region to the eight county\nHUD Dallas rent area. The eight counties are Collin, Dallas, Delta, Denton, Ellis, Hunt,\nKaufman, and Rockwall. The eight county HUD Dallas rent area has 5,589 square miles of land\nwith a population of 3,451,226. It is larger in land area than Rhode Island, Connecticut, or\nDelaware. It has more people than New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Delaware, or\nVermont.\n14. HUD publishes quarterly housing market studies that do not rely on either the 12\ncounty or the eight county region for HUD's rental housing market analysis. HUD's quarterly\nhousing market reports analyze the Dallas area and the Fort Worth area as separate housing\nmarket areas. U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Office of Policy\nDevelopment and Research, \"U.S. Housing Market Conditions.\" HUD's most recent report\nComplaint -4-\n\n. I\nCase 3:07-cv-00945     Document 1      Filed 05/29/2007     Page 5 of 14\nfocusingon the housing market conditions in the Dallas area states that the Dallas Housing\nMarket Area includes only Collin, Dallas, and Denton Counties. The report treats each individual\ncounty as a separate market. U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Office of\nPolicy Development and Research, \"Comprehensive Housing Market Analysis Dallas, Texas As\nof April 1, 2006,\" 2007.\n15. The HUD Dallas rent area, the eight county area, includes five counties that are not\nincluded in the HUD \"Dallas Housing Market Area\" -Delta,Ellis, Hunt, Kaufman, and\nRockwall counties. The eight county area includes three counties that are treated as separate\nhousing markets in HUD's housing market analysis -Collin,Dallas, and Denton. U.S.\nDeparment of Housing and Urban Development Office of Policy Development and Research,\n\"Comprehensive Housing Market Analysis Dallas, Texas As of April 1, 2006,\" 2007.\n16. HUD's own criteria for inclusion or exclusion of an area from a broader geographical\narea for rent determinations for the Section 8 program show that the eight counties in the HUD\nDallas rent area (Collin, Dallas, Delta, Denton, Ellis, Hunt, Kaufman, Rockwall) are not a single\nrental housing market. HUD states that the criteria for inclusion of a county or other area within a\ngiven HUD rent area is based on similarities of rent levels and median family income. A\ndeviation of more than five percent (5%) for either of these characteristics is the HUD criterion\nfor the exclusion of an area from a broader geographical region for its rent determinations.\n17. Under HUD' s criteria, the median family incomes for seven of the eight counties\ndeviate widely from the median family income for the HUD Dallas rent area. The median family\nincome for the Dallas rent area is $56,325. The median family income for each of the eight\ncounties except for Ellis deviates more than five percentage points from the rent area median\nComplaint -5-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945     Document 1      Filed 05/29/2007     Page 6 of 14\nfamily income. The Collin County $81,856 median family income deviates by +45percentage\npoints. The Dallas County $49,062 median family income deviates by - 13 percentage points.\nThe Delta County $37,925 median family income deviates by -33percentage points. The Denton\nCounty $69,292 median family income deviates by +23percentage points. The Hunt County\n$44,388 median family income deviates by -21 percentage points. The Kaufman County $50,354\nmedian family income deviates by - 11 percentage points. The Rockwall County $71,448 median\nfamily income deviates by +27percentage points. Only the Ellis County $55,358 median family\nincome which deviates by -2percentage points falls within the 5 percentage point HUD criterion\nfor inclusion in the HUD Dallas rent area.\n18. The widely disparate two-bedroom recent mover rents for each of the eight counties\nalso contradict HUD's claim that the counties are a single rental housing market. The 2000 U.s.\nCensus median rent for two-bedroom recent movers for each of the counties is: Collin County\n$880, Denton County $799, Rockwall County $763, Dallas County $738, Ellis County $616,\nKaufman County $526, Hunt County $493, and Delta County $443. HUD's 2000 U.S. Census\nBase Rent for the Dallas rent area is $731. Only the $763 Rockwall County median rent and the\n$738 Dallas County median rent fall within 5% of HUD's $731 Base fair market rent for the\nDallas area. The $880 Collin County median rent deviates by +20%. The $799 Denton County\nmedian rent deviates by +9%.The median rents in Ellis, Kaufman, Hunt, and Delta counties\ndeviate between - 16%and -39%.\n19. The use of market areas to establish fair market rentals would result in approximately\nthe same percentage of units available in predominantly White markets as is available in\npredominantly minority markets. HUD's use of the 12 county area causes a disproportionately\nComplaint -6-\n\n. .\nCase 3:07-cv-00945     Document 1      Filed 05/29/2007     Page 7 of 14\nhighnumber of units to be available in predominantly minority markets and a disproportionately\nlow number of units to be available in predominantly White markets.\n20. HUD's stated policy is that the Section 8 program fair rent levels for the Dallas area\nshould make 50% of the rental dwelling units in the Dallas area available for Section 8 use.\n21. HUD's Section 8 program rent setting policy and decisions do not make 50% of the\nrental dwelling units in the Dallas area housing markets available.\n22. HUD's policy and decisions make only 30% of the rental units in predominantly\nWhite areas available for occupancy by persons assisted under Section 8.\n23. HUD's policy and decisions make approximately 70% of the rental units in\npredominantly minority areas available for occupancy by persons assisted under Section 8.\n24.The disparity between the percent of units made available by the HUD rents in White\nareas compared to the percent in minority areas is greater for specific markets. In the City of\nPiano only 13% of the two bedroom units are avaiiable. Piano is 73% White. In contrast, 56% of\nthe two-bedroom units in the City of Dallas are available for Section 8 based on HUD's\ncaicuiations. Dallas is 35% White.\n25. HUD's rent setting formula and its application to the Dallas area Section 8 program\nsteers Biack DHA Section 8 participants into the predominantly minority areas of the City of\nDallas. HUD's rent setting formula and its application to the Dallas area Section 8 program steers\nBlack Section 8 participants away from and out of the predominantly White suburban cities in\nthe Dallas area.\n26. HUD's racial steering makes dwelling units unavailable to Black DHA Section 8\nparticipants and perpetuates racial segregation in the City of Dallas and in the Dallas area.\nComplaint -7-\n\n.\n.\nCase 3:07-cv-00945     Document 1      Filed 05/29/2007     Page 8 of 14\n27. HUD had many opportunities to revise its Section 8 program rent setting policy by\nusing actual market areas instead of multi-county regions. HUD continuously chose not to make\nthe revision but continued to use the multi-county regions.\n28. In 1977, the U.S. Comptroller General notified HUD that HUD's decision to use\nmetropolitan areas and other multi-county regions to set rent levels for the Section 8 program\nwas questionable because it ignored important distinctions between metropolitan central cities\nand suburban areas as well as among suburban areas. The Comptroller General recommended the\ndevelopment of separate rent schedules for individual housing submarket areas instead of one\nrent schedule for an entire SMSA or county group. \"Major Changes are Needed in the New\nLeased Housing Program,\" U.S. Comptroller General Report to Congress, January 28, 1977, pp.\n21, 29. Nevertheless, HUD has continued to use multi-county regions to set Section 8 program\nrent levels.\n29. In 1994, the U.S. Government Accounting Office found that the use of fair market\nrents for the Section 8 program based on smaller geographic areas rather than the multi-county\nregion rent levels would better reflect the rent levels typically prevailing within those smaller\nareas. U.S. GAO, \"Rental Housing Use of Smaller Market areas to Set Rent Subsidy Levels Has\nDrawbacks\" June 1994, p.5. Nevertheless, HUD has continued to use multi-county regions to set\nFMR levels.\n30. HUD's administrative record for the choice of the 12 county area and the policy\nguiding that choice is available through the HUD Policy Development and Research internet site.\nThat record contains no facts showing that HUD considered the effects of its policy and decisions\non the racial composition of the City of Dallas and the suburbs in the Dallas area. That record\nComplaint -8-\n\n. .\nCase 3:07-cv-00945     Document 1      Filed 05/29/2007     Page 9 of 14\ncontainsno facts showing that HUD considered the effects of its policy and decisions on the\navailability of dwellings in predominantly White areas for the Black DHA Section 8 voucher\nprogram participants. The HUD administrative record shows that HUD did not consider the\neffect of its policy and decisions on fair housing opportunities in the Dallas area nor did HUD\nuse its choice of rent setting areas to further fair housing opportunities for DHA' s Black Section\n8 voucher program participants in the Dallas area.\n31. HUD first used the 12 county region as the basis for setting Section 8 maximum rents\nin the Dallas area on February 1, 2006.\nICP's standing\n32. ICP seeks to create and obtain affordable housing opportunities in non-minority\nconcentrated areas for persons eligible for low rent public housing and to provide the counseling\nand other forms of assistance to Black families seeking to use their DHA Section 8 voucher to\nmove into low-poverty, non-minority concentrated areas throughout the Dallas metropolitan area.\nICP provides mobility counseling and mobility assistance to Black Section 8 families seeking\nhousing opportunities in non-minority concentrated and non-poverty concentrated parts of the\nDallas Metropolitan area, the eligible areas.\n33. The counseling assistance provided by ICP to Black DHA Section 8 participants\nincludes pre-move family counseling and related financial assistance to assist the families who\nwant to make and sustain a desegregative housing move. The mobility assistance includes\nnegotiating with landlords as necessary to obtain units in the eligible areas at rents that are\naffordable by the Section 8 families and eligible for the Section 8 subsidy. The financial\nassistance provided to these families includes the payment of application fees, security deposits\nComplaint -9-\n\n.\nCase 3:07-cv-00945     Document 1      Filed 05/29/2007     Page 10 of 14\nandutility deposits to assist families moving into housing that provides desegregative housing\nopportunities in non-minority, non-poverty concentrated areas, where such assistance is\nnecessary to make the desegregative move possible. ICP also makes landlord incentive bonus\npayments to landlords in areas that provide desegregative housing opportunities in non-minority,\nnon-poverty concentrated areas who agree to participate in DHA's Section 8 program when such\nincentives are necessary to secure housing for the Section 8 families. Section 8 families may also\nreceive ICP assistance in the form of a contribution to their reasonable moving expenses in order\nto make a move in an eligible area.\n34. ICP's clients are Black or African American families participating in the DHA's\nSection 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program.\nDirect effects of the HUD rent setting policy on ICP\n35.Bymaking standard quality, non-luxury rental housing unavailable in non-minority\nmarket areas, HUD's rent setting policy directly and adversely affects ICP by:\nA. reducing the number of units that ICP can use to help its clients find housing in non-\nminority concentrated market areas,\nB. increasing the amount of time per client that ICP must spend in order to help its clients\nfind and retain modest rental housing in non-minority concentrated areas,\nC. increasing the amount of financial assistance that ICP must spend in order to help its\nclients find and retain modest rental housing in non-minority concentrated market areas, and\nD. discouraging families with which ICP works from choosing dwelling units in market\nareas that offer racially integrated housing because of the cost factors involved in such a choice.\nComplaint-lO-\n\n.\nCase 3:07-cv-00945     Document 1      Filed 05/29/20S07     Page 11 of 14\nClaimsfor Relief\n36. The Section 8 program legislation requires HUD to use market areas when it\nestablishes the fair market rents for the program. 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o)(1)(B)incorporating 42\nU.S.C. § 1437f(c)(1). HUD's actions using the multi-county regions to establish fair market rents\nviolates HUD's legal obligations under that legislation. HUD's refusal to use market areas to\nestablish fair market rents is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, in excess of statutory\nauthority, short of statutory right, and unwarranted by the facts.\n37. 42 U.S.C. §3608(e)(5)requires HUD to administer the rent setting activity in a\nmaimer to affirmatively further the fair housing policies of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §\n3601,et seq. HUD' s failure to consider the effects of its decisions on the racial composition of\nthe areas affected and on the integrated housing choices available to Black DHA Section 8\nprogram participants violates 42 U.S.C. §3608(e)(5).\n38.

HUD is the federal administrator of the Section 8 program. HUD sets the maximum\nceiling rent for the Section 8 program without regard for market rents in rental housing markets\nin the Dallas area but instead uses the rents in predominantly minority and low income\nconcentrated areas to set the maximum rents for use in predominantly White and non-low income\nconcentrated areas. HUD uses this manipulated maximum ceiling rent to steer Black DHA\nSection 8 participants away from dwellings that should be available for use by Section 8 families\nin modest but decent units in predominantly White Dallas metropolitan area rental housing\nmarkets. HUD’s steering puts many Black Section 8 families into racially segregated areas\nmarked by conditions of slum and blight. HUD’s action selecting the areas for use in setting\nmaximum rents affects the operation of the entire Section 8 program. The suit seeks an end to the\nHUD action.\n2. ICP, the Inclusive Communities Project, Inc., helps Black Section 8 participants obtain\nand keep dwelling units in predominantly White areas. HUD’s actions choosing non-market\nareas as the basis for setting Section 8 maximum rents directly interferes with ICP’s function by\nreducing the number of units in White areas available for use by Section 8 participants. Section 8\n-1-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 42      Filed 10/26/2009     Page 2 of 22\nparticipants already residing in predominantly White areas may have to pay more rent or move\nfrom their current dwelling. Section 8 participants seeking units in predominantly White areas\nmay have to pay more rent and will have fewer units available to them. This suit seeks injunctive\nrelief against the HUD rent setting policies and practices that are perpetuating racial segregation\nin the Dallas metropolitan area.\nJurisdiction\n3. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343(4), and 42 U.S.C. §\n3613(a).\nPlaintiff\n4. The plaintiff is ICP. ICP is a Texas non-profit corporation which works for the creation\nand maintenance of racially and economically inclusive communities, the expansion of fair and\naffordable housing opportunities for low income families, and redress for policies and practices\nthat perpetuate the harmful effects of discrimination and segregation. Specifically, in furtherance\nof this mission, ICP seeks to create and obtain affordable housing opportunities in non-minority\nconcentrated areas for persons eligible for low rent public housing and to provide the counseling\nand other forms of assistance to Black families seeking to use their DHA Section 8 voucher to\nmove into low-poverty, non-minority concentrated areas throughout the Dallas metropolitan area. \nICP’s office is located in the City of Dallas, Dallas County, Texas.\nDefendant\n6. The defendant is the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development\n[HUD]. HUD is an executive agency of the United States of America.\nThe Section 8 program\n7. The Section 8 program is the federal government's major program for assisting very\n-2-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 42      Filed 10/26/2009     Page 3 of 22\nlow-income families to find and pay for decent, safe, and sanitary housing in the private housing\nmarket. The Section 8 families pay at least 30% of their income for the gross rent for a unit.\nGross rent includes both the contract rent and the cost of the utilities for the unit. The Section 8\nsubsidy for the portion of the rent not paid by the Section 8 family is paid directly to the landlord.\nHUD is the federal agency responsible for administering the Section 8 program using federal\nfunds. DHA is a local agency responsible for administering the Section 8 voucher program.\n8.The Section 8 program legislation requires HUD to establish the fair market rents for\nexisting or newly constructed rental dwelling units of various sizes and types in the market area\nsuitable for occupancy by persons assisted under the program. 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o)(1)(B)\nincorporating 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(c)(1). The units suitable for occupancy by persons assisted by\nSection 8 are referred to as “standard quality, non-luxury housing.” The fair market rental for\nstandard quality, non-luxury housing is used to determine:\nA. whether or not a unit is eligible for any subsidy assistance, and\nB. if the unit is eligible for subsidy, the amount of the rent paid by the participant and the\namount of federal subsidy that can be paid on behalf of a Section 8 participant. 42 U.S.C. §\n1437f(o)(2), (3). \n9. Rather than actually determine fair market rents using rental housing markets, HUD\nsets a maximum or ceiling rent for the Section 8 voucher subsidy. HUD sets a different\nmaximum or ceiling rent for specific geographic regions. HUD calls the maximum rent for a\ngeographic area the Fair Market Rent or FMR even if it was set without regard to market areas.\nHUD sets a different FMR for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 bedroom units.\n10. In metropolitan areas that include multiple counties such as Dallas, HUD will set a\nsingle FMR that applies to the entire group of counties. In metropolitan areas that include only\n-3-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 42      Filed 10/26/2009     Page 4 of 22\none county, HUD may set a single FMR for that county. In non-metropolitan areas, HUD\ngenerally sets FMRs for each separate county. But in some metropolitan areas HUD has\nsubdivided a number of predominantly White counties into more than one FMR areas with\ndifferent FMRs for each portion of the county. \n11. The amount of subsidy as determined by the FMR level that is available for the lease\nof a unit determines the areas within which dwelling units will be made available to Section 8\nHousing Choice Voucher tenants. \n12. DHA’s September 24, 2009 CrystalReportViewerWS(1) 092409.xls report contains\ninformation showing that its Section 8 population is 88% Black and approximately 6% White. \n13. The Section 8 families participating in DHA’s Section 8 program are not legally\nrestricted to units in either the City of Dallas or Dallas County. DHA is required to administer the\nSection 8 program for any eligible unit located by a DHA Section 8 participant in Dallas or any\nof the six adjoining counties - Collin, Denton, Kaufman, Rockwall, Ellis, or Tarrant County. But\nthe FMR for the Dallas area has an effect equivalent to a legal restriction. Out of 16,848 DHA\nSection 8 households, there were only 540 DHA Section 8 households in Collin County and only\n319 DHA Section 8 households in Denton County according to DHA’s September 24, 2009\nCrystalReportViewerWS(1) 092409.xls report.\nHUD calculates the Dallas FMRs using a 12 county region instead of housing\nmarkets.\n14. HUD uses the data for rental dwelling units in a 12 county region to set the FMR\nlevels for the eight county HUD Dallas FMR area. For example, the two-bedroom Dallas area\nFMR is based on a set of 2000 U.S. Census rents for two bedroom units in Collin, Dallas, Delta,\nDenton, Ellis, Hunt, Kaufman, Rockwall, Johnson, Parker, Tarrant, and Wise counties. There are\n-4-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 42      Filed 10/26/2009     Page 5 of 22\napproximately 114,000 two bedroom rental units in these 12 counties. The HUD 2000 Census\nbase two-bedroom FMR, $731, is the least amount of rent that makes 57,000 of the 114,000,\n50%, of the units available. The rents for these units range from $204 to $731. HUD then updates\nthis 2000 Census Base FMR by various factors to arrive at the current Fiscal Year FMR. The\ntwo-bedroom FMR is also used to set the rents for 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 bedroom units. The two-\nbedroom FMR is multiplied by various ratios to arrive at the FMR for the other bedroom sizes. \n16. HUD claims that the use of the 12 county region and the use of the eight count region\nto set Dallas area FMRs are justified because those regions are the metropolitan statistical areas\nset by the Federal Office of Management and Budget for use in administering the Section 8\nprogram. HUD’s claim that the use of the multi-county FMR for Dallas area Section 8 FMRs is\njustified by or required by the federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requirements is\nfalse and is a pretext for discrimination. OMB specifically warns against the use of the\nmetropolitan statistical areas  in the administration of programs. \n17. OMB BULLETIN NO. 04-03, February 18, 2004 states:\nNonstatistical Program Uses of the Statistical Area Definitions. In periodically\nreviewing and revising the definitions of these areas, OMB does not take into\naccount or attempt to anticipate any nonstatistical uses that may be made of the\ndefinitions, nor will OMB modify the definitions to meet the requirements of any\nnonstatistical program. Thus, OMB cautions that Metropolitan Statistical Area\nand Micropolitan Statistical Area definitions should not be used to develop and\nimplement Federal, state, and local nonstatistical programs and policies without\nfull consideration of the effects of using these definitions for such purposes. These\nareas are not intended to serve as a general-purpose geographic framework for\nnonstatistical activities, and they may or may not be suitable for use in program\nfunding formulas.\nOMB recognizes that some legislation specifies the use of Metropolitan Statistical\nAreas for program purposes, including the allocation of Federal funds, and will\ncontinue to work with the Congress to clarify the foundations of these definitions\nand the resultant, often unintended consequences of their use for nonstatistical\npurposes.\n-5-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 42      Filed 10/26/2009     Page 6 of 22\nIn cases where there is no statutory requirement and an agency elects to use the\nMetropolitan, Micropolitan, or Combined Statistical Area definitions in\nnonstatistical programs, it is the sponsoring agency's responsibility to ensure that\nthe definitions are appropriate for such use. When an agency is publishing for\ncomment a proposed regulation that would use the definitions for a nonstatistical\npurpose, the agency should seek public comment on the proposed use.\n18. The 12 county area is not a single rental housing market area. The 12 county area\nconsists of 8,990 square miles of land with 5,161,544 people. In fact, HUD sets three separate\nFMRs for use in different parts of the 12 county area. But only the FMR for the Dallas area is set\nusing the data for all 12 counties. HUD sets separate FMR levels in the four counties of Johnson,\nParker, Tarrant, and Wise because of its determination that those counties are two separate FMR\nareas. Johnson, Parker, and Tarrant counties are in one HUD FMR area and that FMR is set using\ndata only for those three counties. Wise County is in a separate FMR area and that FMR is set\nusing data only for Wise County. Despite HUD’s determination that these four counties are\nseparate FMR areas, forty percent (40%) of the units that HUD uses to calculate its FMR levels\nfor the Dallas area FMR are in those four counties - Johnson, Parker, Tarrant, and Wise. \n19. HUD publishes quarterly housing market studies that do not rely on either the 12\ncounty or the eight county region for HUD’s rental housing market analysis. HUD’s quarterly\nhousing market reports analyze the Dallas area and the Fort Worth area as separate housing\nmarket areas. U.S. Deparment of Housing and Urban Development Office of Policy\nDevelopment and Research, “U.S. Housing Market Conditions.” HUD’s 2007 report focusing on\nthe housing market conditions in the Dallas area states that the Dallas Housing Market Area\nincludes only Collin, Dallas, and Denton Counties. The report treats each individual county as a\nseparate market. U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Office of Policy\nDevelopment and Research, “Comprehensive Housing Market Analysis Dallas, Texas As of\n-6-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 42      Filed 10/26/2009     Page 7 of 22\nApril 1, 2006.” \n20. The use of the multicounty region to determine Section 8 FMRs for the Dallas area\nviolates HUD’s own guidance for determining market areas within metropolitan areas with a\ncentral city and a suburban area.  Administrative Record pages 5090 - 5091.\nThe eight county HUD Dallas FMR Area is not a single rental housing market.\n21. HUD applies the FMRs calculated using the 12 county region to the eight county\nHUD Dallas FMR Area. The eight county HUD Dallas FMR Area has 5,589 square miles of land\nwith a population of 3,451,226. It is larger in land area than Rhode Island, Connecticut, or\nDelaware. It has more people than New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Delaware, or\nVermont. The eight county area includes five counties that are not included in the HUD “Dallas\nHousing Market Area” - Delta, Ellis, Hunt, Kaufman, and Rockwall counties. The eight county\narea includes three counties that are treated as separate housing markets in HUD’s housing\nmarket analysis - Collin, Dallas, and Denton. U.S. Deparment of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment Office of Policy Development and Research, “Comprehensive Housing Market\nAnalysis Dallas, Texas As of April 1, 2006,” 2007. \n22. HUD’s own criteria for inclusion or exclusion of an area from a broader geographical\narea for FMR determinations show that the eight counties in the HUD Dallas FMR Area  (Collin,\nDallas, Delta, Denton, Ellis, Hunt, Kaufman, Rockwall) are not a single rental housing market.\nHUD states that the criteria for inclusion of a county or other area within a given FMR Area is\nbased on similarities of rent levels and median family income. A deviation of more than five\npercent (5%) for either of these characteristics is the HUD criterion for the exclusion of an area\nfrom a broader geographical region for FMR determinations.\n23. Under HUD’s criteria, the median family incomes for seven of the eight counties\n-7-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 42      Filed 10/26/2009     Page 8 of 22\ndeviate widely from the median family income for the HUD Dallas FMR Area. The median\nfamily income for the Dallas FMR Area is $56,325. The median family income for each of the\neight counties except for Ellis deviates more than five percentage points from the FMR Area\nmedian family income. The Collin County $81,856 median family income deviates by + 45\npercentage points. The Dallas County $49,062 median family income deviates by - 13 percentage\npoints. The Delta County $37,925 median family income deviates by - 33 percentage points. The\nDenton County $69,292 median family income deviates by + 23 percentage points. The Hunt\nCounty $44,388 median family income deviates by - 21 percentage points. The Kaufman County\n$50,354 median family income deviates by - 11 percentage points. The Rockwall County\n$71,448 median family income deviates by + 27 percentage points. Only the Ellis County\n$55,358 median family income which deviates by - 2 percentage points falls within the 5\npercentage point HUD criterion for inclusion in the HUD Dallas FMR Area.\n24. The widely disparate two-bedroom recent mover rents for each of the eight counties\nalso contradict HUD’s claim that the counties are a single rental housing market. The 2000 U.S.\nCensus median rent for two-bedroom recent movers for each of the counties is: Collin County\n$880, Denton County $799, Rockwall County $763, Dallas County $738, Ellis County $616,\nKaufman County $526, Hunt County $493, and Delta County $443. HUD’s 2000 U.S. Census\nBase Rent for the Dallas ,FMR Area is $731. Only the $763 Rockwall County median rent and\nthe $738 Dallas County median rent fall within 5% of HUD’s $731 Base FMR rent for the Dallas\nFMR Area. The $880 Collin County median rent deviates by + 20%. The $799 Denton County\nmedian rent deviates by + 9%. The median rents in Ellis, Kaufman, Hunt, and Delta counties\ndeviate between - 16% and  - 39%.\n-8-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 42      Filed 10/26/2009     Page 9 of 22\nHUD’s FMR area determination policy and decisions are made because of race in\nviolation of the laws and Constitution.\n25. HUD’s use of the multi-county region to set Dallas area FMRs instead of using\nmarket areas to set the fair market rents for Section 8 is done with a racially discriminatory\npurpose.  There are rental units in predominantly White areas that are standard quality, non-\nluxury housing suitable for occupancy by persons assisted under Section 8. HUD’s use of the\nmulti-county region to set FMRs either makes many of these dwellings in the predominantly\nWhite areas unavailable to Black DHA Section 8 participants or makes those units available only\nat a higher cost to those participants.\n26. HUD’s stated policy is that the FMR levels for the Dallas area should make either\n40% or 50% of the rental dwelling units in the Dallas area housing markets available for Section\n8 use. HUD has used the 50th percentile for some FMRs in the Dallas area and the 40th percentile\nfor some FMRs in the Dallas area.  \n27. HUD’s FMR setting policy and decisions do not make 40 % or 50% of the rental\ndwelling units in the Dallas area housing markets available but instead make a disproportionate\nnumber of units available in predominantly minority areas. But the same HUD FMR setting\npolicy and decisions make a disproportionate number of units in predominantly White areas\nunavailable. HUD’s policy and decisions make approximately 70% of the rental units in\npredominantly minority areas available for occupancy by persons assisted under Section 8. The\nsame HUD policy and decisions make only 30% of the rental units in predominantly White areas\navailable for occupancy by persons assisted under Section 8. The disparity is greater for specific\nmarket areas. In the City of Plano, which is 73% White, only 13% of the two bedroom units are\navailable. In contrast, 56% of the two-bedroom units in the City of Dallas, which is 35% White,\n-9-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 42      Filed 10/26/2009     Page 10 of 22\nare available for Section 8 based on HUD’s FMR calculations using the 2000 U.S. Census data\nfor the HUD base FMRs. \n28. Twenty nine percent (29%) of the two-bedroom units in the 70% to 100% White\npopulation census tracts in the Dallas FMR Area have rents equal to or less than the HUD base\nFMR. Seventy percent (70%) of the two-bedroom units in 700% to 100% minority census tracts\nhave such rents.\n29. HUD had many opportunities to revise its FMR setting policy and decisions to\neliminate the disparities between the number and percent of units available in White compared to\nthe number and percent of units available in minority areas. HUD continuously chose not to\nmake the revision but continued to set FMR levels that made a disproportionate number of units\nin White areas unavailable for use in the Section 8 program. HUD chose to continue to set FMR\nlevels that made a disproportionate number of units in minority areas available for use in the\nSection 8 program.\n30. HUD received a July 31, 2006 comment filed by the attorneys for the plaintiff class in\nWalker v HUD, Civil Action No. 85-1210-H (N.D. Tex.) on the use of the 12 county region as\nthe basis for setting the FY 2006 Section 8 maximum rents in the Dallas area that pointed out the\nracially discriminatory effects of HUD’s policy. HUD’s Fort Worth Office of General Counsel\nresponded to a request for information on the comment by stating they did not question the\ncalculations upon which the allegations of racially discriminatory effects were based and that\nHUD would have to justify its willingness to modify its definitions of metro areas in other urban\ndistricts but not in Dallas. Administrative Record pages 5047 - 5048.\n31. Despite the statements of the Office of General Counsel representatives giving\ncredibility to the allegation of racial discrimination in the setting of the Dallas area Section 8\n-10-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 42      Filed 10/26/2009     Page 11 of 22\nFMRs, HUD’s administrative record for this cases shows that it took no action to investigate\nwhether or not its methods caused either a disproportionate adverse effect on non-Whites or\ncontributed to the perpetuation of racial segregation in the Dallas area by making dwelling units\nin predominantly White areas unavailable to Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program\nparticipants.\n32.  In 1977, the U.S. Comptroller General notified HUD that HUD’s decision to use\nmetropolitan areas and other multi-county regions to set FMR levels for the Section 8 program\nwas questionable because it ignored important distinctions between metropolitan central cities\nand suburban areas as well as among suburban areas. The Comptroller General recommended the\ndevelopment of “separate FMR schedules for individual housing submarket areas instead of one\nFMR schedule for an entire SMSA or county group.” “Major Changes are Needed in the New\nLeased Housing Program,” U.S. Comptroller General Report to Congress, January 28, 1977, pp.\n21, 29.  Nevertheless, HUD has continued to use multi-county regions to set FMR levels.\n33. In 1994, the U.S. Government Accounting Office found that the use of fair market\nrents based on smaller geographic areas rather than the multi-county region FMRs would better\nreflect the rent levels typically prevailing within those smaller areas. U.S. GAO, “Rental Housing\nUse of Smaller Market areas to Set Rent Subsidy Levels Has Drawbacks” June 1994, p.5.\nNevertheless, HUD has continued to use multi-county regions to set FMR levels.\n34. HUD’s calculation of FMRs using multi-county regions instead of housing markets\nperpetuates racial segregation of Black DHA Section 8 participants and perpetuates racial\nsegregation in the Dallas area.\n35. HUD has, in effect, tagged the Section 8 participants with the ghetto rents found in\nthe minority areas in the cities of Dallas and Fort Worth. Those ghetto rents apply to Black\n-11-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 42      Filed 10/26/2009     Page 12 of 22\nSection 8 participants no matter where they look for housing. HUD uses units with low rents that\nare in high poverty, high minority concentrated areas to set FMRs for units in the entire eight\ncounty Dallas FMR Area. Almost half of the units HUD used to set the FMRs for the Dallas\nFMR area are in the predominantly minority cities of Dallas and Fort Worth. Fifty percent (50%)\nof the units within the FMR levels in the Dallas FMR area are in 60% to 100% minority Dallas\nCounty census tracts.\n36. The HUD FMRs limit Black DHA Section 8 participants’ access to the higher rent,\nlower poverty, predominantly White areas in Dallas, Collin and Denton counties. These areas \nhave newer housing and superior public and private services. These predominantly White areas\ninclude suburban cities such as Plano, McKinney, Frisco, Allen, Coppell, Denton, and\nLewisville.\n37. The racial disparity in units made available for Section 8 is shown by census tract\ndata. Only 31% of the two-bedroom units in 90% to 100% White population tracts located in the\nDallas FMR Area have rents equal to or less than the HUD base FMR for two bedroom units.\nSeventy five percent (75%) of the two-bedroom units in 0% to 9% White tracts have such rents.\nThe base HUD FMR is the amount calculated by HUD using 2000 U.S. Census data. The base\nFMR is then updated for the current year FMR. \n38. Forty four percent (44%) of the Dallas area two-bedroom units are in 60% to 100%\nWhite census tracts.  But only 30% of the two-bedroom units available using HUD’s FMR levels\nare in those predominantly White census tracts.\n39. Only 37% of the Dallas area two-bedroom units are in 100% to 60% minority census\ntracts. But 52% of all two-bedroom units with rents equal to or less than the HUD 2000 Census\nbase FMR are in those 100% to 60% minority tracts. \n-12-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 42      Filed 10/26/2009     Page 13 of 22\n40.  The units available for the Section 8 program in predominantly minority areas are\nlocated in areas with neighborhoods with public and private services and facilities that are not\nequal to the services and facilities provided to predominantly White neighborhoods. The unequal\nservices and facilities subject the Section 8 families renting in these neighborhoods to a higher\nprobability of exposure to criminal victimization, adverse environmental conditions, industrial\nnuisance conditions, and lower performing schools than exists in predominantly White areas. \n41. HUD’s calculation of the FMR level for the Dallas FMR Area uses the existence of\nthe racially separate rental housing markets to perpetuate racial segregation. In these segregated\nmarkets, standard quality, non-luxury housing in White areas costs more than standard quality,\nnon-luxury rental housing in minority areas. HUD’s Dallas Area FMRs are below the median\nrent for standard quality, non-luxury rental housing in White areas and above the median rent for\nstandard quality, non-luxury rental housing in minority areas.\n42. The smaller number of units in White market areas resulting from HUD’s FMR\npolicies and decisions steers Black DHA Section 8 participants away from units in White areas\nbecause of the likelihood that:\nA. they will have to spend more time and more money attempting to obtain modest rental\nhousing in predominantly White areas; \nB. the housing in predominantly White areas will cost more requiring them to pay a\npremium to live in those areas, and \nC. despite their search efforts, they will not find housing in the predominantly White\nareas within the limited time available for the housing search. \n43. HUD’s Dallas FMRs make more units available in minority market areas. The larger\nnumber of units in minority areas encourages racial segregation by steering Black DHA Section 8\n-13-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 42      Filed 10/26/2009     Page 14 of 22\nparticipants to find rental housing in the minority market areas or to remain in minority market\nareas. Black DHA Section 8 participants are steered into minority market areas by the higher\nprobability of finding a unit at an affordable rent. \n44. HUD’s conduct restricts and attempts to restrict the choices of Black Section 8\nprogram participants in connection with seeking, negotiating for, and renting dwellings so as to\nperpetuate, or tend to perpetuate, segregated housing patterns, and to discourage or obstruct\nchoices in predominantly White communities, neighborhoods, and developments. HUD’s\nconduct is because of the race or color of the Black Section 8 program participants and because\nof the race or color of the persons residing in the racially and ethnically segregated communities,\nneighborhoods, and developments in the Dallas area. \n45. HUD uses single county or smaller areas to determine FMRs in non-metropolitan\nareas and in metropolitan areas with only one county in other parts of the country. These single\ncounty areas are disproportionately White and contain a disproportionate percent of the nation’s\nWhite population compared to the metropolitan FMR areas that contain more than one county. \nThe Section 8 participants in the single county FMR areas are disproportionately White\ncompared to the total Section 8 population. \n46. HUD sets two or more FMRs based on parts of 19 counties. All of these counties are\nmore than 73% White. Eight are 80% to 89% White and nine are more than 90% White. The\ncombined population of these 19 counties is 85% White, 4% Black, and 6% Hispanic. The\nSection 8 participants in these counties are disproportionately White compared to the total\nSection 8 population. \n47. HUD uses multi-county regions to determine FMRs only in metropolitan areas that\n-14-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 42      Filed 10/26/2009     Page 15 of 22\ncontain more than one county. These multi-county regions are disproportionately occupied by\nBlack residents, 15% compared to 12% of the Nation. A disproportionate percentage of the Black\npopulation resides in these multi-county FMR areas - 72% of the Black population compared to\napproximately 58% of the Nation’s population. The Section 8 participants in these multi-county\nFMR areas are disproportionately Black compared to the total Section 8 population. \nThe discriminatory effects of HUD’s FMR setting policy can be avoided by using a\nless discriminatory alternative that would accomplish the legitimate interests of a fair\nmarket rent setting policy. \n48. HUD’s FMR policy has a disproportionate and discriminatory effect on the\npredominantly Black DHA Section 8 participant population. The discriminatory effects are those\nset out above. These effects and the use of the multi-county regions to set FMRs are not\nnecessary elements of a legitimate fair market rent setting policy. \n49. HUD’s actions in other parts of the United States demonstrate the existence of a less\ndiscriminatory alternative to HUD’s use of the multi-county FMR regions. For one example,\nHUD has created three separate Fair Market Rent areas in Fairfield County, Connecticut. Each of\nthe HUD Fairfield County FMR areas consists of a larger city surrounded by a core of smaller\ntowns. The FY 2007 two bedroom FMRs for the three separate FMR areas in Fairfield County\nare $1,024 in the Bridgeport, Connecticut HUD FMR Area, $1,267 in the Danbury, Connecticut\nHUD FMR Area, and $1,592 in the Stamford-Norwalk HUD FMR Area. Rather than being\nrestricted by a single FMR set using a multicounty region, the Section 8 households in Fairfield\nCounty, Connecticut have access to units in the three separate FMR areas for each of the larger\ncities in the county.\n50. A similar use of market areas would provide desegregated and non-discriminatory\n-15-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 42      Filed 10/26/2009     Page 16 of 22\naccess to locations in all three of the larger, urban counties in the Dallas area, Dallas, Denton,\nand Collin counties. For example, HUD’s own rental data shows that the approximate 50th\npercentile 2000 Census Base Rent FMR for the smaller White areas is 10% to 30% higher than\nHUD Dallas area 2000 Census Base Rent FMR of $731. The 2000 Census Base Rent FMR for\nPlano is $924, for Richardson is $839, and for Coppell is $952. Similarly, the 2000 Census Base\nRent FMR for Collin County is $879 and $800 for Denton County.\n51. The use of market areas would not increase HUD’s administrative costs for setting the\nFMRs. The data is already available and the calculations are simply done on a spreadsheet.\n52. The use of market areas would not increase the total amount of federal funds used for\nthe Section 8 program in the Dallas area. That funding is determined without regard to current\nFMR levels.\n53. The use of market areas does not decrease the total number of Section 8 units\navailable in the Dallas area. The higher subsidies that could be paid in the higher FMR White\nareas will be offset by the lower subsidies in the lower FMR minority areas.\n54. There is no legitimate, bona fide, good faith governmental justification for the use of\nthe multi-county region to set fair market rents for the Section 8 program in the Dallas area. \nThe discriminatory effects of the FMR decreases resulting from HUD’s FMR setting\npolicy can be avoided by using a less discriminatory alternative that would accomplish the\nlegitimate interests of a fair market rent setting policy. \n55. HUD uses multi-county regions instead of rental housing markets to set the FMR\nlevels for the Dallas area. The discriminatory effects of the FMR policy are set out above. These\neffects and the use of the multi-county regions to set FMRs are not necessary elements of a\nlegitimate fair market rent setting policy. \n-16-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 42      Filed 10/26/2009     Page 17 of 22\n56. The less discriminatory alternative using rental housing markets to determine fair\nmarket rents for the use of Section 8 vouchers in the Dallas area achieves the legitimate\nobjectives of a Fair Market Rent policy without increasing HUD’s administrative costs for setting\nthe FMRs. The data is already available and the calculations are simply done on a spreadsheet.\n57. The use of market areas would not increase the total amount of federal funds used for\nthe Section 8 program in the Dallas area. That funding is determined without regard to FMR\nlevels.\n58. The use of market areas would not decrease the total number of Section 8 units\navailable in the Dallas area. The higher subsidies that could be paid in the higher FMR, White,\nareas will be offset by the lower subsidies in the lower FMR, minority, areas leaving\napproximately the same total number of Section 8 vouchers in use. \n59. There is no legitimate, bona fide, good faith governmental justification for the FMR\ndecreases or the use of the multi-county region to set fair market rents for the Section 8 program\nin the Dallas area. \nThe HUD FMR decision making record contains no facts to show that HUD\nconsidered the effects of its decisions in light of its obligations to affirmatively further fair\nhousing and to avoid racial discrimination.\n60. HUD’s public administrative record for its choice of the geographic areas to be used\nin its FMR decisions is available through the HUD Policy Development and Research internet\nsite. That record shows that HUD did nothing to consider the effects of its choice of the\ngeographic areas to be used in its FMR policy and decisions on the racial composition of the\nareas covered by the FMRs or on the housing choices of minority Section 8 Housing Choice\nVoucher participants. That record shows that HUD did nothing to consider the effects of its\n-17-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 42      Filed 10/26/2009     Page 18 of 22\nchoice of the geographic areas to be used in its FMR decisions on the availability of dwellings in\npredominantly White areas for the Black DHA Section 8 voucher program participants. The\nFMR administrative record shows that HUD did not consider the effect of its choice of the\ngeographic areas to be used in its FMR policies and decisions on fair housing opportunities in the\nDallas area nor did HUD use its FMR policies and decisions to further fair housing opportunities\nfor DHA’s Black Section 8 voucher program participants in the Dallas area.\n61. HUD has also produced another administrative record that consists of 5,108 pages\nthat was served on August 19, 2009. This record shows that HUD did nothing to consider the\neffects of its choice of the geographic areas to be used in its FMR policy and decisions on the\nracial composition of the areas covered by the FMRs or on the housing choices of minority\nSection 8 Housing Choice Voucher participants. This record shows that HUD did nothing to\nconsider the effects of its choice of the geographic areas to be used in its FMR decisions on the\navailability of dwellings in predominantly White areas for the Black DHA Section 8 voucher\nprogram participants. This FMR administrative record shows that HUD did not consider the\neffect of its choice of the geographic areas to be used in its FMR policies and decisions on fair\nhousing opportunities in the Dallas area nor did HUD use its FMR policies and decisions to\nfurther fair housing opportunities for DHA’s Black Section 8 voucher program participants in the\nDallas area.\nICP standing.\n62. The Inclusive Communities Project, Inc. is a Texas non-profit corporation which\nworks for the creation and maintenance of thriving racially and economically inclusive\ncommunities, expansion of fair and affordable housing opportunities for low income families,\n-18-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 42      Filed 10/26/2009     Page 19 of 22\nand redress for policies and practices that perpetuate the harmful effects of discrimination and\nsegregation.\n63. ICP seeks to create and obtain affordable housing opportunities in non-minority\nconcentrated areas for persons eligible for low rent public housing and to provide the counseling\nand other forms of assistance to Black families seeking to use their DHA Section 8 voucher to\nmove into low-poverty, non-minority concentrated areas throughout the Dallas metropolitan area.\nICP provides mobility counseling and mobility assistance to Black Section 8 families seeking\nhousing opportunities in non-minority concentrated and non-poverty concentrated parts of the\nDallas Metropolitan area, the eligible areas.\n64. The counseling assistance provided by ICP to Black DHA Section 8 participants\nincludes pre-move family counseling and related financial assistance to assist the families who\nwant to make and sustain a desegregative housing move. The mobility assistance includes\nnegotiating with landlords as necessary to obtain units in the eligible areas at rents that are\naffordable by the Section 8 families and eligible for the Section 8 subsidy. The financial\nassistance provided to these families includes the payment of application fees, security deposits\nand utility deposits to assist families moving into housing that provides desegregative housing\nopportunities in non-minority, non-poverty concentrated areas, where such assistance is\nnecessary to make the desegregative move possible. ICP also makes landlord incentive bonus\npayments to landlords in areas that provide desegregative housing opportunities in non-minority,\nnon-poverty concentrated areas who agree to participate in DHA’s Section 8 program when such\nincentives are necessary to secure housing for the Section 8 families. Section 8 families may also\nreceive ICP assistance in the form of a contribution to their reasonable moving expenses in order\n-19-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 42      Filed 10/26/2009     Page 20 of 22\nto make a move in an eligible area.\n65. ICP’s clients are Black or African American families participating in the DHA’s\nSection 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program.\nDirect effects of the HUD FMR policy on ICP\n66. By making standard quality, non-luxury rental housing unavailable in non-minority\nmarket areas, HUD’s FMR policy directly and adversely affects ICP by:\nA. reducing the number of units that ICP can use to help its clients find housing in non-\nminority concentrated market areas,\nB. increasing the amount of time per client that ICP must spend in order to help its clients\nfind and retain modest rental housing in non-minority concentrated areas,\nC. increasing the amount of financial assistance that ICP must spend in order to help its\nclients find and retain modest rental housing in non-minority concentrated market areas,\n67. ICP bases its standing on its own injuries incurred as a result of HUD’s decisions\nselecting the areas to use in HUD’s rent setting policy.\nClaims for Relief\n68. HUD’s actions choosing the geographic area to use in setting the Fair Market Rent\namounts for the Section 8 Housing Choice Program in the Dallas, TX area are agency actions.\nThese agency action are not in accordance with the following laws: the equal protection principle\nincorporated in the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a); and 42\nU.S.C. § 3608(e)(5).  HUD’s agency actions choosing the geographic area to use in setting the\nFair Market Rent amounts are not in accordance with these laws because the actions make\ndwelling units unavailable in predominantly White areas because of race and color and\n-20-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 42      Filed 10/26/2009     Page 21 of 22\nperpetuate racial segregation in the Dallas area. \n69. 42 U.S.C. § 3608(e)(5) requires HUD to administer the FMR setting activity in a\nmanner affirmatively to further the fair housing policies of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §\n3601, et seq.  HUD’s failure to consider the effects of its decisions on the racial composition of\nthe areas affected and on the integrated housing choices available to Black DHA Section 8\nprogram participants violates 42 U.S.C. § 3608(e)(5). \n70. Plaintiff has a claim for relief for HUD’s actions that were not and are not in\naccordance with the specified laws pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § § 702, 706. Sovereign immunity for\nthe injunctive relief requested in this complaint as the remedy for ICP’s claims is waived by 5\nU.S.C. § 702 .\nPrayer for relief\n71. Plaintiff requests the following relief:\nA. an injunction prohibiting HUD from using multi-county regions as the basis for setting\nFMR levels for the separate rental housing markets in the Dallas metropolitan area;\nB. an injunction compelling HUD to consider and further fair housing opportunities for\nDHA’s Black Section 8 voucher program participants when it chooses the geographic areas to\nuse in setting FMRs in the Dallas area; \nC. an award of attorney fees, litigation expenses, and court costs, and\nD. any other appropriate injunctive relief.\n-21-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 42      Filed 10/26/2009     Page 22 of 22\nRespectfully Submitted,\n            s/ Michael M.

PLAINTIFF CANNOT ENJOIN THE STATUS QUO, IMPROPERLY SEEKS\nREDRESS FOR GENERALIZED GRIEVANCES, AND IMPROPERLY ASSERTS\nSPECULATIVE CLAIMS\nA. Plaintiff Cannot Obtain Injunctive Relief to Preserve the Status Quo\nIn an effort to avoid improperly requesting an injunction to prevent past actions, City of Los\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945     Document 16      Filed 11/13/2007     Page 2 of 12\nAngeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 102 (1983); James v. City of Dallas, 254 F.3d 551, 563 (5th Cir. 2001),\nplaintiff now claims that its seeking of an injunction requiring HUD to use the fiftieth percentile rents\n“merely keeps the status quo.”  Pl. Op. at 21 n.9.  Nevertheless, absent moving for a preliminary\ninjunction and making all required showings for such a “extraordinary and drastic remedy,” Mazurek v.\nArmstrong, 520 U.S. 968, 972 (1997), plaintiff cannot obtain an injunction to maintain the status quo. \nAccord Univ. of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981).  Moreover, as HUD demonstrated in its\nopening brief, nowhere in plaintiff’s Complaint has it alleged that HUD is likely to set future Dallas\nArea FMR based on anything other than the fiftieth percentile rent.  See Compl. passim. Accordingly,\nplaintiff cannot invoke this Court’s remedial powers to enjoin HUD’s past or present actions.  Accord\nLyons, 461 U.S. at 102; James, 254 F.3d at 563.  See also Univ of Tex., 451 U.S. at 395.\nB. Plaintiff’s Request for an Injunction Eliminating Racial Disparities In Rental\nMarkets Is Nothing More Than a Generalized Grievance\nPlaintiff lacks standing to request an injunction “eliminating the disparities between the number\nand percent of dwelling units made available in predominantly White rental housing markets and the\nnumber and percent of . . . units made available in predominantly minority rental housing markets” \nCompl. ¶ 39D, not because it has failed to allege injuries that might otherwise be sufficient to maintain\nan action alleging violations of the Fair Housing Act, see Havens Realty Corp v. Coleman, 455 U.S.\n363 (1979), but because its requested relief cannot be construed as anything other than an improper\n“sweeping request to generally eradicate the effects of discrimination.”  James, 254 F.3d at 568.  As\ndemonstrated in our opening brief, James expressly rejected plaintiffs’ request that HUD be ordered “to\nremedy ‘the loss of housing units caused by the HUD funded housing code enforcement and housing\ncode enforcement related demolitions of repairable family units as well as the resulting blight,’” id.,\nbecause that was “‘a generalized grievance shared in substantially equal measure by all or most\ncitizens,’” and, as such, “cannot provide standing to request injunctive relief.”  Id. (quoting Warth v.\nSeldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499 (1975)).  James controls resolution of this case.  Whether plaintiff, as a fair\nhousing organization can meet the injury-in-fact requirements set out in Havens and similar cases is\nbeside the point–defendant does not challenge plaintiff’s alleged injuries at this time.  The Havens fair\n- 2 -\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945     Document 16      Filed 11/13/2007     Page 3 of 12\nhousing plaintiff sought to enjoin a building owner’s discriminatory steering practices, and had\nstanding to do so.  Havens, 455 U.S. at 369.  By contrast, plaintiff’s request here to eliminate racial\ndisparities in housing opportunities is nothing more than a request to redress generalized grievance\nshared in substantially equal measure by all or most citizens, and is insufficient to confer standing.\nC. Plaintiff’s Proposed Remedies Are Not Likely to Redress Its Alleged Injuries\nPlaintiff’s failure to demonstrate that it is “‘likely, as opposed to merely speculative,’” James,\n254 F.3d at 564 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561), that a judgment invalidating HUD’s FY 2006 and\nFY 2007 Dallas FMRs, or requiring HUD to create and use new and varying FMRs within the Dallas\narea, would redress its injuries, see Compl. ¶ 39 Prayer for Relief, is fatal to its entire case.  \nFirst, plaintiff’s request that this Court “order[] HUD to implement the FY 2005 Dallas area\nSection 8 program rent levels for the non-Black and non-poverty concentrated areas in Collin, Dallas,\nand Denton counties,” Compl. ¶ 39A, will not redress plaintiff’s alleged injuries simply because\nHUD’s FMR for the Dallas area for fiscal year 2008, now in effect, is $871, Decl. of Kurt G. Usowski\nin Supp. of Def. Mot. to Dismiss (“Usowski Decl.”) ¶ 21, and is higher than the FY 2005 FMR of\n$868, id., that plaintiff has requested.  Compl. ¶ 39A.1  Because plaintiff cannot demonstrate that it\n“would directly benefit from the equitable relief sought,” Plumley v. Landmark Chevrolet, Inc., 122\nF.3d 308, 312 (5th Cir. 1997), it lacks standing.  Accord Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 107. \nSecond, regardless of whether plaintiff can trace its injuries to HUD’s actions, as it has\n1  Plaintiff’s assertions in its opposition brief, Pl. Op. at 5, that FY 2008 FMRs for three- and four-\nbedroom units are lower than FY 2003 FMR for three-bedroom units or FY 2004 FMR for four-bedrooms\ndoes not solve its standing problem.  First, the complaint requests that the Court implement FY 2005 FMRs in\ncertain non-minority areas, not FY 2003 or FY 2004 FMRs.  Compl. ¶ 39A.  Second, the complaint makes no\nallegations that any of its clients rent, or seek to rent, three- or-four bedroom units, see id. passim, and thus\nfails to plead a particularized injury about three- or four-bedroom rents.  Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better\nEnv’t, 523 U.S. 83, 103-104 (1998).  Third, plaintiff’s attempt to raise this issue for the first time in its\nopposition brief in an attempt to create standing is too late to do so now.  “It is axiomatic that the complaint\nmay not be amended by the briefs in opposition to a motion to dismiss.”  Car Carriers, Inc. v. Ford Motor\nCo., 745 F.2d 1101, 1107 (7th Cir. 1984) (improper for “district court to have relied on the plaintiffs’ briefs\nto embellish the conclusory allegations of the complaint.”).\nBy contrast, to the extent that plaintiff suggests defendant’s declaration is improper or that plaintiff\nshould be given the benefit of the doubt in a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, Pl. Op. at 4-5, it is mistaken.  Menchaca v.\nChrysler Credit Corp., 613 F.2d 507, 511 (5th Cir. 1980) (defendant may challenge the existence of subject\nmatter jurisdiction in fact, irrespective of the pleadings, and matters outside the pleadings, such as affidavits,\nare considered.  Moreover, plaintiff bears the burden of proof that jurisdiction does in fact exist.).  \n- 3 -\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945     Document 16      Filed 11/13/2007     Page 4 of 12\nunsuccessfully attempted to do, Pl. Op. at 24, plaintiff has failed to establish that, were this Court to\norder HUD to establish separate FMR Areas for predominately White areas of the Dallas Metropolitan\nDivision, Compl. ¶ 39B-D, it is likely that its clients would be able to obtain housing in those areas.  In\nfocusing on traceability, plaintiff ignores its burden to establish that it is likely that the relief it seeks\nwill redress its injuries.  Accordingly, plaintiff’s reliance on a declaration of its Mobility Assistance\nDirector does nothing to alleviate its reliance on impermissible speculation about what landlords in\npredominantly White areas might do if HUD set higher FMRs.  Cf. Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 751,\n758 (1984) (overly speculative as to whether requiring the IRS to enforce its rules which prohibited tax\nbreaks to racially discriminatory private schools, would prevent segregated schools, because\nwithdrawal of tax breaks would not necessarily convince these private schools to change policies, or\nconvince parents to transfer their children to nonsegregated schools); Simon, 426 U.S. 26, 43-44 (1976)\n(overly speculative to conclude that suspending tax benefits to private hospitals would force those\nhospitals to take on more indigent patients).2  \nIn this regard, Burton v. Cent. Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact Com’n, 23\nF.3d 208 (8th Cir. 1994), exposes plaintiff’s failure in establish a likelihood of favorable redress.  As\ndefendant explained in its opening brief, the Burton court acknowledged that plaintiffs, might be able\nto establish the traceability prong of standing, by showing that “LES [a third party] increased electricity\nrates in response to the [defendant’s] taxes on LLRW [another third party].”  Id. at 209-10. \nNevertheless, the court held that establishing traceability was still insufficient because, as is the case\nhere, it required the court to “take it on faith that LES, which is not a party to this action, would adjust\nits rates if the district court enjoined the [defendant’s] taxes on LLRW.”  Id. at 210.  Thus, in Burton,\nas here, it was “merely speculative” whether a favorable decision would affect plaintiffs.  Id.  This\nCourt has already applied the holding of Burton before to hold that plaintiffs lacked standing because\nthey could not establish a likelihood of favorable redress, Haile v. Town of Addison, 264 F. Supp. 2d\n2  Plaintiff’s reliance on Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peòa, 515 U.S. 200, 211 (1995), and Bennett\nv. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 168-69 (1997), Pl. Op. At 23-34, is inapposite.  Adarand did not concern\nredressability.  515 U.S. at 211. Bennett did not concern a private party, but two different branches of the\nfederal government, one of which, the Court held, was bound to follow the other.  520 U.S. at 168-69.   \n- 4 -\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945     Document 16      Filed 11/13/2007     Page 5 of 12\n464, 467 (N.D. Tex. 2003), and should do so again here.  As in Allen, Simon, Burton and Haile, even if\nthis plaintiff could establish that private owners in predominantly White areas have reduced their\nparticipation in the Dallas area PHAs’ voucher programs because of HUD’s use of the Dallas MSA to\ncalculate the FMR, it remains merely speculative whether private owners in such areas would increase\ntheir participation in the Dallas area PHAs’ voucher programs if this Court were to set aside HUD’s\ndetermination.3\nII. THIS COURT HAS NO JURISDICTION OVER PLAINTIFF’S CLAIMS BECAUSE\nTHE APA PROVIDES NO WAIVER OF SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY HERE\nA. Congress’s Use of the Term “Market Area” In the Housing Act Does Not Define\nThat Term Nor Provide This Court With Any Standards To Evaluate Its Meaning\nBecause the APA precludes judicial review of agency actions “committed to agency discretion\nby law,” 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2), its waiver of sovereign immunity is unavailable to plaintiff.4  As\ndefendant demonstrated in its opening brief, Congress’s use of the term “market area” in the Housing\nAct provides no “meaningful standards for defining the limits of [agency] discretion,” and accordingly,\nthere is no “law to apply” under § 701(a)(2).  See Def. Mot. to Dismiss at 16-20 (citing Heckler, 470\nU.S. at 834; Suntex Dairy v. Block, 666 F.2d 158, 163-64 (5th Cir. 1982)).  \nIn attempting to inject some standard into the meaning of the term “market area” by which this\nCourt could review the reasonableness of HUD’s interpretation, plaintiff offers the plain language of\nthe statute, legislative history, HUD and other government documents, and caselaw.  None advances\nplaintiff’s case. \n3  Defendant notes that nowhere in plaintiff’s opposition does it oppose defendant’s contention that\nplaintiff’s challenges to HUD’s FMR for the Dallas area for both FY 2006 and FY 2007, Compl. ¶¶ 12, 39A,\nare moot.  See Pl. Op. passim.  Accordingly, this Court should treat this part of plaintiff’s claim as conceded. \nDefendant also notes plaintiff makes no mention of the FY 2008 FMR in its complaint, only its opposition. \nPl. Op. at 21.    \n4  Plaintiff devotes several pages of its opposition to arguing that HUD’s determination of the FMR\narea constitutes “final agency action,” Pl. Op. 10-11, and arguing that 5 U.S.C. § 702 waives sovereign\nimmunity in non-APA cases, id. at 11-12, even though neither point is at issue in this case.  See Compl.\npassim; Def. Mot. passim.  In this regard, plaintiff’s reliance on Trudeau v. FTC, 456 F.3d 178, 183-187\n(D.C. Cir. 2006), is completely inapposite.  Trudeau held only that the waiver of sovereign immunity in 5\nU.S.C. § 702 extends beyond APA actions and is not confined to a court’s power to review final agency\nactions.  Trudeau is inapposite here because plaintiff brings its case directly under the APA and because it\nseeks review of HUD’s final actions in setting FMRs for the Dallas area.\n- 5 -\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945     Document 16      Filed 11/13/2007     Page 6 of 12\nFirst, plaintiff simply quotes the language of the statute itself, emphasizing that it uses the term\n“market area.”  Pl. Op. at 13 (quoting 42 U.S.C. §§ 1437f(o)(1)B) and 1437f(c)(1)).  But the issue is\nnot whether “market area” is a term used in the statute.  Rather the issue is whether the Housing Act\nincludes any standard by which a court could judge the reasonableness of HUD’s interpretation of that\nterm.  As demonstrated in our opening brief, Def. Mot. at 18-19, because the Act does not do so,\ninterpretation of that term is committed to agency discretion.  Suntex Dairy, 666 F.2d at 163-64.5  \nSecond, plaintiff offers a quotation from the Senate version of a bill to suggest that a reasonable\ngeographic area for a housing market could not have any significant variance in rent, Pl. Op. at 13-14\n(quoting S. Rep. No. 93-693 (reprinted in 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4273, 4315)).  The problem with\nplaintiff’s argument is that, with respect to this statutory provision, Congress passed the House version. \nH. Conf. Rep. No. 93-1279 (“The House amendment requires HUD to establish fair market rental in\neach housing market area. . . . The conference report contains the House provisions.”) (reprinted in\n1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4449, 4465 (1974) (emphasis added)).  Moreover, the language of the Conference\nReport, which is what Congress ultimately passed, does not resolve the meaning of “market area.”  Id.\n(stating only that “the HUD Secretary is expected to take into account factual data, analyses, and\nrecommendations . . . in various market areas.”) (emphasis added).  \nIn a case such as this, legislative history provides this Court with no guidance, because “[l]ike\nother extrinsic aids to construction, the use of legislative history is to solve, but not to create, an\nambiguity.”  H. Wetter Mfg. Co. v. U.S., 458 F.2d 1033, 1035 (6th Cir. 1972).  See also Blanchard v.\nBergeron, 489 U.S. 87, 99 (1989) (Scalia, J. concurring) (“It is neither compatible with our judicial\nresponsibility of assuring reasoned, consistent, and effective application of the statutes of the United\nStates, nor conducive to a genuine effectuation of congressional intent, to give legislative force to each\nsnippet of analysis . . . in committee reports that are increasingly unreliable evidence of what the voting\nMembers of Congress actually had in mind.”). Accordingly, in deciding whether HUD’s interpretation\nof the term “market area” is subject to judicial review, this Court should focus on the language of the\n5  Contrary to plaintiff’s contention that defendant has conceded that the Dallas FMR Area is not a\nmarket area, Pl. Op. at 13, defendant has defined the term “market area” to include the Dallas FMR Area.  \n- 6 -\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945     Document 16      Filed 11/13/2007     Page 7 of 12\nstatute, for “it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our\nlegislators by which we are governed.’” Cooper Indus., Inc. v. Aviall Services, Inc., 543 U.S. 157, 168\n(2004) (quotation marks and citation omitted). \nMoreover, where, as here, “Congress revisits a statute giving rise to a longstanding\nadministrative interpretation without pertinent change, the ‘congressional failure to revise or repeal the\nagency’s interpretation is persuasive evidence that the interpretation is the one intended by Congress.’”\nCommodity Futures Trading Comm’n v. Schor, 478 U.S. 833, 846, (1986) (quoting NLRB v. Bell\nAerospace Co., 416 U.S. 267, 274-75 (1974)).  See also Peyote Way Church of God, Inc., v. Meese,\n698 F. Supp. 1342, 1346 (N.D. Tex. 1986) (same).  In this case, since passing the 1974 Amendments to\nthe U.S. Housing Act that created the Section 8 program, Congress has amended 42 U.S.C. § 1437f\nsome 36 times and has twice expressly amended § 1437f(c)(1) to create separate fair market rental\nareas for Westchester County, New York, Pub. L. 100-242, Title I § 142(c)(1), 101 Stat. 1849 - 1853,\n1878, 1890 (Feb. 5, 1988), and Monroe County, Pennsylvania, Pub. L. 102-139, Title II, 105 Stat. 756\n(Oct. 28, 1991), but has otherwise left the term “market area,” and HUD’s interpretation of it,\nunchanged.  Usowski Decl. ¶ 4.  Indeed, despite repeated amendments to the Section 8 program\ngenerally and the express additions to § 1437f(c)(1) of specific fair market rent areas, Congress’s\nacceptance of HUD’s interpretation provides “an unusually strong case of legislative acquiescence in\nand ratification by implication.”  Bob Jones Univ. v. U.S., 461 U.S. 574, 599 (1982).  \nThird, plaintiff points to a HUD report, not on the Section 8 program, but on housing\nproduction subsidies in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Housing Service Section 515\nprogram, Pl. Op. at 15 (citing Targeting Housing Production Subsidies (2003)).  The report states that\n“there is no single national rental housing market,” and that large metropolitan areas “do not constitute\nsingle housing markets.”  Targeting Production Subsidies, at 7.  Whatever the value of these statements\nabout a program operated by a different Department, the fact that HUD not only sets FMRs in about\n2,500 market areas, Usowski Decl. ¶ 3, but has also divided the Dallas-Ft. Worth-Arlington\nMetropolitan area into different FMR areas in administering the housing choice voucher program, id.\n¶¶ 11, 14-17, demonstrates that HUD’s actions are not inconsistent with the report’s statements.  More\n- 7 -\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945     Document 16      Filed 11/13/2007     Page 8 of 12\nto the point, the report does nothing to provide this Court with the standards necessary to determine\nwhether HUD’s interpretation of the term “market area” is reasonable.  \nLastly, plaintiff cites two district court cases that merely mention, but do not define, the term\n“market area” and have nothing whatsoever to do with the U.S. Housing Act.  Pl. Op. at 15 (citing\nCCA Assocs. v. U.S., 75 Fed. Cl. 170, 202-03 (2007); DKE Alumni Corp. v. Colgate Univ., 492 F.\nSupp. 2d 106, 113-14 (N.D.N.Y. 2007)).  Neither case provides this Court with any standards by which\nto review HUD’s actions.  In CCA Assocs., the court addressed expert testimony concerning “fair\nmarket value,” not market areas, in a case that concerned takings, not the housing choice voucher\nprogram.  75 Fed. Cl. at 20-3.  DKE Alumni Corp. was an antitrust case, and, in fact, expressly rejected\nthe plaintiff’s efforts to define the relevant housing market as contiguous with the borders of a town,\nfinding a much larger area, perhaps even a national one, was appropriate for that analysis.  492 F.\nSupp. 2d at 115-18.  The fact that plaintiff is forced to rely on these cases demonstrates the complete\ndearth of any judicial standards by which this Court could judge the reasonableness of HUD’s actions.6  \n   B. Because Suit Against Dallas Area Public Housing Authorities Provides Plaintiff\nWith Another Adequate Remedy in a Court, the APA Does Not Waive Immunity \nBecause plaintiff’s ability to bring suit against Dallas area PHAs for unreasonably refusing to\nvary rents above HUD’s published FMR for the Dallas area provides it with “an adequate remedy in a\ncourt,” 5 U.S.C. § 704, the APA’s waiver of sovereign immunity does not apply to any of plaintiff’s\n6  In an effort to focus the Court’s attention of the reasonableness of HUD’s interpretation, rather than\nwhether any such interpretation is even reviewable, plaintiff claims that OMB has issued a  “strong warning”\nagainst use of its metropolitan area definitions in non-statistical programs, Pl. Op. at 6 (citing Pl. App. at 13). \nHowever, unless and until this Court resolves defendant’s motion to dismiss, the reasonableness of HUD’s\ninterpretation is not properly before this Court.  Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil Co., 526 U.S. 574, 583 (1999).  \nIn any event, plaintiff fails to mention that OMB expressly states that the use of its metropolitan area\ndefinition may or may not be suitable for use in program funding formulas,” and that OMB acknowledges\nthat each agency has discretion to determine if such use is appropriate.  See Pl. App. at 13.  In fact, HUD\neconomists and demographers were not only involved in drafting the new OMB definitions, but also\ndetermined that they “better reflect how local housing markets should be evaluated” because they “placed\nincreased weight on commuting patterns.”  70 Fed. Reg. 32401, 32403 (June 2, 2005).  Plaintiff’s insinuation\nalso ignores the fact that, where appropriate, HUD modified these definitions, as it did in the Dallas-Ft.\nWorth-Arlington Metro Area, if, for example, “2000 Census Base Rents differed by more than [five] percent\nfrom the new OMB area 2000 Census Base Rent.”  Id.  \n- 8 -\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945     Document 16      Filed 11/13/2007     Page 9 of 12\nclaims against HUD.7  Notwithstanding plaintiff’s mischaracterization of HUD’s exception payment\nstandards, Pl. Op. at 19, each Dallas area PHA retains the authority not only to vary rents between 90\nand 120 percent of HUD’s published FMR (with HUD approval above 110 percent), see 24 C.F.R.\n§§ 982.503(b)-(c), but also, with HUD approval,8 to vary them in “an exception area” above 120\npercent of HUD’s published FMR to help families find housing outside areas of high poverty.  Id.\n§ 982.503(c)(3)-(4)(i)(A).  Thus, if, as plaintiff asserts, Pl. Op. at 19, the median rent in Coppell, TX is\n27 percent higher than HUD’s published FMR for the Dallas area, any Dallas area PHA could, with\nHUD approval, vary the rent in Coppell above 120 percent.  24 C.F.R. § 982.503(c)(3)-(4)(i)(A). \nThus, suit against the Dallas area PHAs to compel them to follow through on their initial attempts to\nvary rents could provide plaintiff with the remedy it seeks – “provid[ing] black DHA housing voucher\nparticipants “equal access” to “White rental housing markets,” Compl. ¶ 39C, D, and “eliminating the\ndisparities between the number and percent of dwelling units made available in predominantly White\nrental markets and the number and percent of . . . units made available in predominantly minority rental\n. . . markets.”  Id. ¶ 39D.  Because this remedy is available to plaintiff, the APA provides no waiver of\nsovereign immunity here.  Turner v. Sec’y of HUD, 449 F.3d 536, 540 (3d Cir. 2006).  \nC. The Court Should Dismiss Plaintiff’s Section 3608(e)(5) Claims Because HUD Has\nNeither Failed to Act Nor Wrongfully Withheld Action \nBecause plaintiff does not, and could not, identify a circumscribed, discrete agency action that\n42 U.S.C. § 3608(e)(5) requires HUD to take, Norton v. So. Utah Wilderness Alliance (“SUWA”), 542\nU.S. 55 (2004), requires dismissal of plaintiff’s § 3608(e)(5) claims.  SUWA held that “pervasive\n7  Because the Tucker Act does not create a substantive right enforceable against the United States for\nmonetary damages, e.g., Mients v. U.S., 50 Fed. Cl. 665, 671 (2001), and because plaintiff’s complaint has\nnot alleged a right to monetary damages under a statute or regulation, Compl. passim, defendant withdraws its\nargument that APA § 704 bars jurisdiction over plaintiff’s claims because it could have pursued an action in\nthe Court of Claims for monetary damages.\n8  Plaintiff’s assertion, Pl. Op. at 19, that HUD has not approved DHA’s exception payment request is\ndisingenuous.  Although the Dallas Housing Authority submitted an initial request, Pl. App. at 31-33, HUD’s \nexplained that DHA need to provide additional information.  Id. at 34.  Although DHA provided some\nadditional information, id. at 35, it was unable to provide HUD with specific apartments or census tracts\nwhere rents were too high.  Id.  Thus, it was DHA, and not HUD, that failed to follow through in seeking\nexception payments in 2002, but again, in 2006.  See Decl. of Donald L. Darling [submitted herewith].\n- 9 -\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945     Document 16      Filed 11/13/2007     Page 10 of 12\noversight by federal courts over the manner and pace of agency compliance with [broad] congressional\ndirectives is not contemplated by the APA.”  Id. at 66-67.  \nContrary to plaintiff’s assertions, Pl. Op. at 17, the only case plaintiff cites which does not\neither pre-date SUWA or ignore it,9 Darst-Webbe Tenant Ass’n Bd. v. St. Louis Hous. Auth., 417 F.3d\n898 (8th Cir. 2005), affirmed the dismissal of an action alleging violations of § 3608(e)(5).  417 F.3d at\n909.  It did not, as plaintiff suggests, reject application of SUWA to § 3608 claims.  See generally id. \nOf course, to the extent Darst-Webbe is in any way inconsistent with SUWA, this Court should simply\ndisregard the decision.  In any event, the Darst-Webbe panel merely addressed its earlier order (which\npre-dated SUWA) that the district court, on remand, determine whether HUD had assessed “those\naspects of its proposed course of action that would further limit the supply of genuinely open housing”\nand assessed “those aspects of the proposed course of action that would increase that supply.”  Id. at\n907.  In so doing, the court found that its standard of review was merely “to assess whether HUD\nexercised its broad authority in a manner that demonstrates consideration of, and an effort to achieve,\nfair housing opportunities.”  Id.  However, because the court’s holding addressed an order that pre-\ndated SUWA, its finding is sui generis, and has no precedential value.10\nAccordingly, because SUWA, and not Darst-Webbe, controls resolution of plaintiff’s\n§ 3608(e)(5) claims, the APA precludes review of these claims.  \nCONCLUSION\nThis Court should grant defendant’s motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n9   Anderson v. Jackson, 2007 WL 458232 (E.D. La. Feb. 6, 2007), did not even acknowledge SUWA.\n10  Even if Darst-Webbe had any persuasive authority after SUWA, which it does not, HUD’s efforts\nto increase fair housing opportunities in the administration of its housing choice voucher program would\neasily satisfy the Darst-Webbe standard.  First, as noted in HUD’s opening brief, in order to increase the\nability of voucher tenants to access all parts of large metropolitan housing markets, especially in markets\nwhere affordable housing was concentrated in high poverty areas, HUD has issued an interim rule\nestablishing criteria for setting the FMR at the fiftieth percentile rent (instead of the fortieth percentile) in\nlarge metropolitan FMR areas that meet specific criteria for size, concentration of housing renting at or below\nthe fiftieth percentile FMR, and concentration of voucher tenants in particular neighborhoods.  Usowski Decl.\n¶ 9; 24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c).  Second, as set out above and in HUD’s opening brief, HUD’s regulations\nimplementing the voucher program provide PHAs with options to increase or decrease area rents in order to\nincrease housing opportunities in non-minority areas.  Usowski Decl. ¶ 6; 24 C.F.R. §§ 982.503(b)-(c).  Both\nthese efforts easily demonstrate HUD’s consideration of and efforts to achieve, fair housing opportunities.  \n- 10 -\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945     Document 16      Filed 11/13/2007     Page 11 of 12\nDated: November 13, 2007\nRespectfully submitted,\nPETER D.

Plaintiff brings  suit  under  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act  (“APA”),  5  U.S.C.  §§8  701  et \nseq.,  alleging  violations  of Section  8  of the  U.S.  Housing  Act,  42  U.S.C.  §  1437f(0)  (the  “voucher \nprogram”’),  and  the  Fair  Housing  Act,  42  U.S.C.  §  3608(e)(5).  However,  as  set  forth  below,  this  Court \nlacks  subject  matter jurisdiction  over  plaintiff's  claims  because  plaintiff cannot  satisfy  the  case  or \ncontroversy  requirement  of Article  III  of the  U.S.  Constitution,  and  because  no  waiver  of sovereign \nimmunity  encompasses  its  claims. \nFirst,  plaintiff lacks  Article  III  standing  to  challenge  HUD’s  actions  because  plaintiff:  (1)  seeks \ninjunctive  relief for  past  injuries,  (11)  asserts  generalized  grievances,  (iii)  asserts  injuries  on  behalf of \nthird  parties,  and  (iv)  requests  relief that  will  not  redress  its  injuries  or  relies  on  mere  speculation  about \nwhat  private  landlords,  who  are  not  before  this  Court,  might  do  if this  Court  were  to  enjoin  HUD’s \nactivities.  In  addition,  plaintiffs  challenge  is,  at  least  in  part,  now  moot. \nSecond,  even  if plaintiff had  standing  to  assert  any  of its  claims,  this  Court  would  still  lack \nsubject  matter jurisdiction  because  Congress  has  not  waived  sovereign  immunity  under  APA  for  these \nclaims.  Rather,  the  APA  provides  no  waiver  of immunity  over  plaintiff's  Section  8  claims  against \nHUD  because  Congress  has  committed  HUD’s  rent-setting  activities  to  the  agency’s  discretion  and  has \nset  no  standards  by  which  this  Court  could  review  those  actions.  Moreover,  the  APA  bars  suit  because \nplaintiff has  another  adequate  remedy  at  law,  namely,  suit  against  the  Dallas  area  housing  authorities \nover  their  rent  setting  role  in  the  Dallas  area.  Finally,  the  APA  bars  suit  for  plaintiff's  Fair  Housing \nAct  claims  against  HUD  because  that  Act  provides  no  discrete  mandate  for  HUD  to  follow  in  carrying \nout  its  role  in  the  Section  8  program. \nSTATUTORY  BACKGROUND \nIn  1974,  Congress  amended  the  United  States  Housing  Act  of  1937  (“Housing  Act”)  to  create \nwhat  is  known  as  the  Section  8  program.  Through  Section  8’s  housing  choice  voucher  program, \nCongress  hoped  to  “ai[d]  low-income  families  in  obtaining  a  decent  place  to  live,”  42  U.S.C.\nCase  3:07-cv-00945  Documents  _  Filed  10/02/2007  Page 8  of  34 \n§  1437f(a),  by  subsidizing  private  landlords  who  rent  to  low-income  tenants.  Under  the  program, \ntenants  make  rental  payments  based  on  their  income  and  ability  to  pay;  and  public  housing  authorities \n(“PHAs’”),  funded  by  HUD,  make  “assistance  payments”  to  the  private  owners  in  an  amount  calculated \nto  make  up  the  difference  between  the  tenant’s  contribution  and  a  “contract  rent”  agreed  upon  by  the \nowner  and  the  PHA.  The  subsidy  is  implemented  through  Housing  Assistance  Payment  (“HAP”) \ncontracts  entered  into  between  the  PHA  and  a  property  owner  which  extensively  regulate  an  owner’s \nmanagement of  the  property.  42  U.S.C.  §  1437f(0)(7).  HAP  contracts  set  the  maximum  allowable  rent \nan  owner  may  charge  and  the  subsidy  amount  the  PHA  pays,  and  require  owners  to  maintain  the \nproperty  in  a  safe  and  sanitary  condition.  /d.  §§  1437f(c)(1),  1437f(0)(2),  (8). \n1.  Owner  Selection  of Tenants \nThe  voucher  program  reflects  Congress’s  desire  to  encourage  the  participation  of the  private \nsector  in  providing  low-income  housing  by  leaving  management  decisions  (which  includes  the \nselection  of tenants)  to  the  private  owner.  In  that  regard,  the  Housing  Act  mandates  that  contracts \nbetween  a  PHA  and  a  private  owner  “shall  provide  that  the  ..  .  selection  of families  ..  .  shall  be  the \nfunction  of the  owner.”  Jd.  §  1437f(0)(6)(B).' \nHUD’s  regulations  for  the  voucher  program  also  recognize  the  private  owner’s  discretion  in  the \nselection  of tenants.  See,  e.g.,  24  C.F.R.  §§  982.307(a)(2)  (“The  owner  is  responsible  for...  selection \nof the  family  to  occupy  the  owner’s  unit.  At  or  before  PHA  approval  of the  tenancy,  the  PHA  must \ninform  the  owner  that...  selection  for  tenancy  is  the  responsibility  of the  owner.”).  See  also  id. \n§  982.452  (same).  Thus,  the  language  used  in  the  regulations  clearly  makes  a  distinction  between  a \ntenant’s  “eligibility”  to  participate  in  the  voucher  program,  cf  id.  §  982.201(a)  (“The  PHA  may  only \nadmit  an  eligible  family  to  the  program”’),  and  the  owner’s  “selection”  of that  tenant. \nThus,  an  owner  generally  has  no  obligation  to  participate  in  the  Section  8  program  and  can \nrefuse  to  accept  a  voucher,  even  if that  means  an  otherwise  acceptable  family  is  unable  to  lease  the  unit. \n  \n'  Previously,  Section  8  contained  a  “take-one,  take-all  requirement”  under  §  8(t)  of Act,  providing \nthat  once  an  owner  accepted  a  certificate  or voucher holder  in  any multifamily project,  that  owner  could not \nreject  other  eligible  tenants.  However,  Congress  suspended  §  8(t)  from  1996  through  1998  by  appropriations \nacts,  and permanently repealed  the  provision by the  Quality Housing  &  Work Responsibility Act,  Pub.  L.  No. \n105-276,  §  545,  112  Stat.  2461,  2596  (1998). \n-2-\nCase  3:07-cv-00945  Documenté  Filed  10/02/2007  Page  9  of  S4 \nPut  another  way,  a  landlord  is  free  to  take  as  many  or  as  few  Section  8  tenants  as  he  may  choose,  just \nas  he  is  free  to  take  no  Section  8  tenants  at  all. \n2.  Fair  Market  Rents \nSection  8  requires  HUD  to  set  the  “fair  market  rent[]...  annually  for  existing  ..  .  units  of \nvarious  sizes  ...in  the  market  area.”  42  U.S.C.  §  1437f(c)(1)..  While  Congress  has  established \nstandards  for  HUD’s  determination  of FMRs,  see,  e.g.,  id.  (requiring  FMRs  to  be  adjusted  annually  on \nOctober  1  of each  year  (hereafter  the  “fiscal  year”)  based  on  the  “most  recent  data”),  it  has  provided  no \nstandards  or  guidance  defining  the  term  “market  area.”  See  id.  See  also  Decl.  of Kurt  G.  Usowski  in \nSupp.  of Def.  Mot.  to  Dismiss  (“Usowski  Decl.”)  4  4  [submitted  herewith].  Accordingly,  HUD  has \nused  the  discretion  provided  to  it  by  Congress  to  establish  multi-county  metropolitan  areas  as  defined \nby  the  Office  of Management  and  Budget  (“OMB”)  as  the  principal  basis  for  determining  the  market \narea,  or  “FMR  Area,”  while  reserving  the  authority  to  make  limited  exceptions.  Id.  See  24  C.F.R. \n§  888.113(d).  Congress  has  had  the  opportunity  to  direct  HUD  to  use  something  other  than \nmulti-county  Metropolitan  Areas  as  the  basis  for  FMR  computations,  or  otherwise  to  provide  standards \nfor  determining  FMR  Areas  with  each  annual  HUD  appropriations  bill,  during  the  periodic  process  of \ngenerally  reauthorizing  HUD’s  programs,  and  in  multiple  other  pieces  of incidental  legislation  affecting \nHUD  programs.  Usowski  Decl.  §  4.  However,  with  the  exception  of specific  statutory  direction  to \nestablish  FMRs  for  Westchester  County,  New  York,  and  for  Monroe  County,  Pennsylvania,  Congress \nhas  not  done  so.  /d.  See  42  U.S.C.  §  1437f(c)(1). \nHUD  generally  bases  FMRs  on  the  fortieth  percentile  of standard  quality  rental  units  occupied \nby  “recent  movers”  in  the  market,  or  “FMR”  area.  24  C.F.R.  §  888.113(b).  A  fortieth  percentile  rent \nmeans  that  forty  percent  of units  in  the  FMR  Area  rent  for  the  FMR  or  less,  while  sixty  percent  rent  for \nthe  FMR  or  more.  Usowski  Decl.  §  9.  However,  in  the  late  1990s,  HUD  became  concerned  about  the \nability  of voucher  tenants  to  access  all  parts  of large  metropolitan  housing  markets,  especially  in \nmarkets  where  affordable  housing  was  concentrated  in  high  poverty  areas.  /d.  Accordingly,  in  2000, \nHUD  issued  an  interim  rule  establishing  criteria  for  setting  the  FMR  at  the  fiftieth  percentile  rent  in \nlarge  metropolitan  FMR  Areas  that  met  specific  criteria  for  size,  concentration  of housing  renting  at  or \nbelow  the  fortieth  percentile  FMR,  and  concentration  of voucher  tenants  in  particular  neighborhoods. \n3-\nCase  3:07-cv-00945  Documents  _  Filed  10/02/2007  Page  10  of  34 \nSee  24  C.F.R.  §  888.113(c). \nIn  the  voucher  program,  the  FMR  that  HUD  sets  for  each  Metropolitan  Area  forms  the  basis  for \ndetermining  a  PHA’s  “payment  standard  amount,”  which  the  PHA  uses  to  calculate  the  maximum \nmonthly  subsidy  for  an  assisted  family  to  rent  a  particular  unit.  /d.  §  1437f(0)(1)(B);  24  C.F.R. \n§  982.503(b).  The  voucher  program  allows  a  PHA  to  vary  the  payment  standard  amount  between  90 \nand  110  percent  of HUD’s  published  FMR  for  the  area,  id.  §  1437f(0)(1)(B);  24  C.F.R.  §  982.503(b), \nand  with  HUD  approval,  the  PHA  can  also  vary  the  payment  standard  amount  above  110  percent  for \ncertain  high  rent  areas.  /d.  §  1437f(0)(1)(D);  24  C.F.R.  §  982.503(c)  (“exception  payment  standards’’). \nSee  also  Usowski  Decl.  ¥  6. \nFrom  the  inception  of the  Section  8  voucher  program  up  until  fiscal  year  (“FY”)  2004, \nCongress  funded  the  voucher  program  based  on  a  number  of vouchers  that  were  allocated  among  PHAs \nby  formula  established  by  HUD.  Usowski  Decl.  §  5.  Under  this  funding  mechanism,  if HUD \nincreased  the  FMR  or  a  PHA  increased  its  payment  standard,  additional  HUD  funds  went  to  affected \nPHAs  to  cover  the  increased  rent  subsidies.  /d.  In  FY2004  and  through  to  the  present,  Congress \nchanged  the  funding  mechanism  for  vouchers  to  a  dollar-based  budget.  /d.  Now,  increases  in  FMRs  or \npayment  standards  may  mean  that  a  PHA  has  to  serve  fewer  tenants  because  paying  higher  rent \nsubsidies  per  voucher  means  fewer  vouchers  can  be  supported  by  a  given  annual  funding  allocation. \nId.  Accordingly,  PHAs  face  a  tradeoff between  the  number  of vouchers  than  can  be  supported  and  the \namount  of the  subsidy  its  Section  8  vouchers  can  provide.  Jd.  4  6. \n3.  Fair  Market  Rents  in  the  Dallas  Area \nHUD’s  FY2005  Dallas  two-bedroom  FMR,  based  on  the  fiftieth  percentile  rent,  as  plaintiff \n  \n*  In  the  current  eight-county  Dallas  FMR Area,  the  Housing  Choice  Voucher program  is  operated by \nfourteen  local  PHAs,  each  of which,  because  vouchers  are  portable,  has  more  than ninety percent  of its \ntenants  living  throughout  the  Dallas  FMR Area,  plus  the  Texas  Department  of Community Affairs,  which  has \nabout  39  percent  of its  tenants  throughout  the  Dallas  FMR Area.  /d.  47.  The  local  PHAs  in  the  Dallas  area \nare  associated with particular  cities  or  counties,  but  their  charters  may  allow  for wider jurisdictions.  Under \nthe  Consent  Decree  entered in  Walker v.  HUD,  No.  85-1210  (N.D.  Tex.  Jan.  20,  1987),  for example,  the \nHousing Authority  of the  City  of Dallas  (“Dallas  Housing  Authority,”  or  “DHA’’)  has  wide jurisdiction  to \nassist  tenants  with  finding  housing  throughout  the  Dallas  and Fort  Worth  metropolitan  areas. \nA.\nCase  3:07-cv-00945  Documents  _  Filed  10/02/2007  Page  11  of  34 \ncorrectly  alleges,  was  $868.  See  70  Fed.  Reg.  9778  (Feb.  28,  2005).?

HUD  defined  these  exceptions  in  a  way  to \nminimize  FMR  changes  due  to  altered  geography,  primarily  because  of the  combination  of OMB’s  old \nmetropolitan  areas  into  larger  MSAs.  70  Fed.

In  general,  HUD \ndecided  to  use  the  new  OMB-defined  area  as  the  basis  for  FMR  Areas,  but  used  subareas  following  the \nlines  of its  FY2005  FMR  Areas  when  sub-area  base  fortieth  percentile  rents  from  the  2000  Census \ndiffered  by  more  than  five  percent  from  the  base  fortieth  percentile  rent  of the  OMB-defined  area. \nUsowski  Decl.  ¥  13.*  Essentially,  HUD  divided  OMB-defined  MSAs  that  had  combined  HUD’s \nFY 2005  FMR  Areas  when  they  had  substantially  different  FMRs.  Jd. \nIn  Dallas,  OMB’s  new  principal  definition  of the  Metropolitan  Area  is  a  combined  Dallas-Fort \nWorth-Arlington  Metropolitan  Statistical  Area  (the  “Dallas  MSA”).  Jd.  §  12.  OMB’s  Dallas  MSA \nconsists  of  12  counties:  Collin,  Dallas,  Delta,  Denton,  Ellis,  Hunt,  Johnson,  Kaufman,  Parker, \nRockwall,  Tarrant,  and  Wise.  /d.  §  14.  Based  on  FY  2005  FMR  Area  definitions,  HUD  divided  the \nDallas  MSA  into  three  “HUD  Metro  FMR  Areas”  because  two  of the  candidate  sub-areas,  which  were \nseparate  FMR  Areas  in  FY2005,  had  2000  Census  base  rents  that  differed  by  more  than  five  percent \nfrom  the  2000  census  base  rent  of the  twelve-county  area.  Jd.”  Because  the  remaining  eight-county \n  \n*  HUD’s  FY  2005  FMR  for the  Dallas  area was  the  result  of changes  to  the  Dallas  FMR that began  in \nFY  2001,  when  HUD,  after  determining  that  the  Dallas  FMR Area  qualified under HUD’s  new  fiftieth \npercentile  FMR regulations,  set the  Dallas  two-bedroom FMR  at  $830,  up  from  $749  in  FY2000,  which had \nbeen based  on  the  fortieth  percentile  rent.  /d.  |  9.  HUD  continued to  use  fiftieth percentile  rents  in  FY  2002, \nFY  2003,  and FY  2004,  which  set  the  Dallas  area FMR  at  $810,  $850,  and  $871,  respectively.  Jd.  §  10. \n*  Prior to  FY  2006,  HUD’s  Dallas  FMR Area was  based  on  the  OMB-defined Dallas  Primary \nMetropolitan  Statistical  Area.  Usowski  Decl.  §  8. \n>  One  new FMR Area was  Wise  County,  which under the  old  OMB  Metropolitan Area  definitions \nand HUD’s  FMR Area  definitions  in  FY2005,  was  a non-metropolitan  county.  /d.  §]  15.  Since  it  had \nsufficient  2000  Census  data  to  compute  a 2000  Census  base  rent,  and  the  base  rent  differed by  more  than  five \npercent  from the  twelve-county  area base  rent,  HUD  made  Wise  County  a  separate  FMR Area.  /d.  Because \nthe  other  formerly non-metropolitan  county  added by  OMB,  Delta  County,  did not  have  a  sufficient  2000 \nCensus  count  of two-bedroom,  standard-quality,  recent-mover,  rental  units  to  compute  a  census  base  rent  of \nits  own,  HUD  kept  it  as  part  of the  Dallas  FMR Area.  /d. \nHUD  also  made  the  three  counties  in  the  new  OMB-defined  area  that were  in  the  old Fort  Worth \nFMR Area  (Johnson,  Parker,  and  Tarrant)  a  separate  FMR Area because,  again,  the  2000  Census  base  rent  for \n5-\nCase  3:07-cv-00945  Documents  _  Filed  10/02/2007  Page  12  of  34 \narea  (Collin,  Dallas,  Delta,  Denton,  Ellis,  Hunt,  Kaufman,  and  Rockwall)  did  not  have  a  2000  Census \nfortieth  percentile  base  rent  that  differed  by  more  than  five  percent  from  the  twelve-county  area,  HUD \nused  the  twelve-county  area  to  set  the  base  rent  for  the  Dallas  FMR  Area  for  FY 2006.  Jd.  417.  Based \non  the  fiftieth  percentile  rent,  the  two-bedroom  FY  2006  FMR  for  the  Dallas  area  would  have  been \n$824.  Id.  However,  two  other  events  unrelated  to  HUD’s  use  of new  FMR  Areas  occurred  that  had \nthe  effect  of reducing  the  revised  final  FY2006  two-bedroom  FMR  to  $733.  Id. \nFirst,  as  part  of the  development  of the  proposed  FY2006  FMRs,  HUD  conducted  another \nsurvey  of the  Dallas  area.  /d.  4  18.  The  survey  covered  the  higher-rent,  eight-county  area  only,  not  the \ntwelve-county  area.  The  result  reduced  the  fiftieth  percentile  two-bedroom  FMR  to  $777,  as  published \nin  the  unrevised  final  FMRs  on  October  3,  2005.  See  70  Fed.  Reg.  57654  (Oct.  3,  2005).  The  decline \nin  rent  for  the  Dallas  FMR  Area,  as  measured  by  the  survey,  directly  reflects  the  very  soft  rental \nhousing  market  that  existed  in  Dallas  at  the  time.  Usowski  Decl.  4  18. \nSecond,  on  August  25,  2005,  HUD  determined,  after  a  review  required  under  HUD  regulations \nthat  govern  fiftieth  percentile  FMR  determinations,  that  the  Dallas  FMR  Area  was  no  longer  eligible  to \nremain a  fiftieth  percentile  FMR  Area  because  the  Dallas  area  PHAs’  reporting  rates  on  the  location  of \nvoucher  tenants  was  too  low  to  be  considered  reliable.  See  70  Fed.  Reg.  50138  (Aug.  25,  2005).  See \nalso  Usowski  Decl.  §  19.  Accordingly,  on  February  14,  2006,  HUD  reduced  the  FMR  in  the  Dallas \nFMR  Area  to  $733,  based  on  the  fortieth  percentile  rent,  for  the  remainder  of FY  2006.  See  71  Fed. \nReg.  7832  (Feb.  14,  2006);  Usowski  Decl.  4]  19.° \nHUD’s  current  FY2008  FMRs,  which  became  effective  yesterday,  October  1,  2007,  not  only \nuses  the  fiftieth  percentile  rent  but  also  employ  data  from  the  new  American  Community  Survey \n(“ACS”),  a  continuously  administered  survey  operated  by  the  Census  Bureau.  /d.  §  21.  In  evaluating \nthe  ACS  data,  HUD  compared  fiftieth  percentile,  standard-quality,  recent-mover  rents  for  the \ntwelve-county  OMB-defined  area,  and  the  eight-county  Dallas  FMR  Area.  /d.  The  number  for  the \n  \nthe  three  counties  differed by  more  than  five  percent  from the  twelve-county  area base  rent.  Id.  §  16. \n°  Although  HUD  based FY  2006  Dallas  Area FMR  on  the  fortieth percentile  rent,  by the  time  HUD \nwas  developing  the  FY2007  FMRs,  Dallas-area  PHAs  had  improved their reporting  on voucher tenant \nlocations  sufficiently  to  be  eligible  again  for  a  fiftieth  percentile  FMR.  Usowski  Decl.  §] 20.  HUD’s  FY2007 \nDallas  Area two-bedroom  FMR,  based  on  the  fiftieth percentile  rent,  was  $798.  Id. \n-6-\nCase  3:07-cv-00945  Documenta  Filed  10/O2/2007  Page  13  of  34 \nsmaller  area  was  only  1.8  percent  higher  than  the  data  for  the  larger  area,  and  as  such,  was  not  different \nby  more  than  was  likely  to  be  accounted  for  by  sampling  error.  /d.  In  other  words,  the  two-bedroom \nfiftieth  percentile  rent  for  the  OMB-defined  twelve-county  Dallas  MSA  is  statistically  equivalent  to  the \ntwo-bedroom  fiftieth  percentile  rent  for  HUD’s  eight-county  Dallas  FMR  Area  as  measured  by  2005 \nACS  data.  Id.  Accordingly,  HUD’s  final  FY2008  Dallas  Area  two-bedroom  FMR,  based  on  the \nfiftieth  percentile  rent,  is  currently  $871.  Jd. \n4.  Plaintiff’s  Complaint \nPlaintiff alleges  that  HUD’s  use  of the  Dallas  MSA  to  calculate  the  FMR  for  FY  2005  and  FY \n2006  has  made  “standard  quality,  non-luxury  rental  housing  unavailable  in  non-minority  market  areas.” \nCompl.  435.  Plaintiff further  alleges  that  this  injures  it  by  “reducing  the  number  of units  that  ICP  can \nuse  to  help  its  clients  find  housing,”  and  increasing  the  amount  of “time”  and  “financial  assistance”  that \nit  must  spend  “to  help  its  clients  find  and  retain  modest  rental  housing  in  non-minority  concentrated \nmarket  areas.”  /d.  4]  35A-C.  Further,  plaintiff alleges  that  this  injures  its  clients,  who  are  not  before \nthis  Court,  by  “discouraging  [them]  from  choosing.  .  .  units  in  market  areas  that  offer  racially \nintegrated  housing...”  /d.  4  35D. \nTo  redress  its  alleged  injuries,  plaintiff seeks  an  injunction:  (1)  first,  setting  aside  FMRs  for \nfiscal  years  2006  and  2007  for  all  of the  Dallas  FMR  Area  and  instead  using  HUD’s  FY  2005  FMR  in \ncertain  non-minority  parts  of the  Dallas  FMR  Area,  id.  §  39A,  and  then  (11)  requiring  HUD  to  use \nundefined  “rental  housing  market  areas”  as  the  basis  for  its  FMR  determinations  that  provide  black \nDHA  housing  voucher  participants  “equal  access”  to  “White  rental  housing  markets,”  id.  4]  39C,  D, \n(111)  requiring  HUD  to  use  the  “[fiftieth]  percentile  basis”  for  its  FMR  calculations,  id.  |  39D,  and \n(iv)  “eliminating  the  disparities  between  the  number  and  percent  of dwelling  units  made  available  in \npredominantly  White  rental  markets  and  the  number  and  percent  of...  units  made  available  in \npredominantly  minority  rental  ...  markets,”  and  providing  “fair  housing  opportunities.”  /d.  §  39D,  E.\nCase  3:07-cv-00945  Documenta  Filed  10/O2/2007  Page  14  of  34 \nSTANDARD  OF  REVIEW \nA.  Justiciability  of  Plaintiff’s  Claims  Against  HUD \n1.  Article  HI  Standing \nPlaintiff's  standing  under  Article  III  of the  U.S.  Constitution  to  maintain  this  action  in  federal \ncourt  is  a  threshold jurisdictional  matter  that  must  be  decided  prior  to  other  issues  involved  in  the  case. \nCole  v.  Gen.  Motors  Corp.,  484  F.3d  717,  721  (Sth  Cir.  2007).  The  “irreducible  constitutional \nminimum  of standing”  requires  that  plaintiffs  demonstrate  (a)  an  “injury  in  fact”  which  is  “concrete  and \nparticularized,”  (b)  that  the  injury  is  “fairly  ..  .  trace[able]  to  the  challenged  action  of the  defendant, \nand  not...  th[e]  result  [of]  the  independent  action  of some  third  party  not  before  the  court,”  and \n(c)  that  it  is  “  ‘likely,’  as  opposed  to  merely  ‘speculative,’  that  the  injury  will  be  ‘redressed by  a \nfavorable  decision.’”  Lujan  v.  Defenders  of Wildlife,  504  U.S.  555,  560-561  (1992)  (emphasis  added) \n(quoting  in part  Simon  v.  E.  Ky.  Welfare  Rts.  Org.,  426  U.S.  26,  38,  41-42,  43  (1976)).

Moreover,  these  three \ncore  requirements  of standing  are  substantially  more  difficult  to  establish  where,  as  here,  plaintiff is  not \nitself the  direct  object  of the  particular  government  action  or  inaction  challenged  in  the  lawsuit.  Lujan, \n504  U.S.  at  562. \n2.

At \nthat  point,  no  order  of the  court  can  affect  the  rights  of the  parties  with  regard  to  the  requested  relief. \nDeFunis  v.

Standard  of Review  under  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act \nA  party  may  not  bring  suit  against  the  United  States  absent  an  explicit  waiver  of sovereign \nimmunity  by  Congress.  U.S.  v.  Sherwood,  312  U.S.  584,  586  (1941);  Drake  v.  Panama  Canal  Com’n, \n907  F.2d  532,  535  (Sth  Cir.  1990).  Such  waiver  “must  be  unequivocally  expressed  in  statutory  text... \n[and]  will  be  strictly  construed,  in  terms of  its  scope,  in  favor  of  the  sovereign.”  Lane  v.  Pena,  518 \nU.S.  187,  192  (1996).  See  also  Rothe  Dev.  Corp.  v.  U.S.  Dep’t  of Defense,  194  F.3d  622,  624  (Sth  Cir. \n1999).  Accordingly,  plaintiff cannot  maintain  any  claims  against  HUD  absent  a  waiver  of sovereign \nimmunity  that  covers  those  claims,  and  plaintiff is  bound  by  any  limitations,  substantive  or  procedural, \nthat  any  such  waiver  imposes.  Veldheon  yv.  U.S.  Coast  Guard,  35  F.3d  222,  225  (Sth  Cir.  1994). \nThe  only  sovereign  immunity  waiver  that  could  apply  to  plaintiff's  claims  appears  in  the  APA. \n5  U.S.C.  §§  701  et seg.  See  Rothe  Dev.  Corp.,  194  F.3d  at  624.  The  APA  allows  for  limited  judicial \nreview  of “[a]gency  action  made  reviewable  by  statute  and  final  agency  action,”  5  U.S.C.  §  704,  but \nprecludes  such  review  when  agency  actions  are  “committed  to  agency  discretion  by  law,”  id. \n§  701(a)(2);  Heckler  v.  Chaney,  470  U.S.  821,  830  (1985),  or  when  there  is  another  “adequate  remedy \nin  acourt.”  Id.  §  704;  Warner  v.  Cox,  487  F.2d  1301,  1304  (Sth  Cir.  1974).  Thus,  for  example,  an \nAPA  action  that  might  otherwise  be  properly  brought  against  a  federal  agency  is  barred  if the  plaintiff \ncan  obtain  its  remedy  against  a  non-federal  party.  Turner  v.  Sec’y  of  HUD,  449  F.3d  536,  539-41  (3d \nCir.  2006). \nWhen judicial  review  is  available,  a  reviewing  court  must  uphold  the  agency’s  action  unless  it \nis  “arbitrary,  capricious,  an  abuse  of discretion,  or  otherwise  not  in  accordance  with  law.”  5  U.S.C. \n§  706(2)(A).  See  also  Marsh  v.  Ore.  Natural  Res.  Council,  490  U.S.  360,  375  n.21  (1989);  City  of \nAbilene  v.  EPA,  325  F.3d  657,  664  (5th  Cir.  2003).  This  standard  is  narrow  and  deferential,  and  only \nrequires  that  the  agency  articulate  a  rational  relationship  between  the  facts  found  and  the  decision \nmade.  City  of Abilene,  325  F.3d  at  664.  The  Court’s  only  role  is  to  determine  “whether  the  decision \nwas  based  on  a  consideration  of the  relevant  factors  and  whether  there  has  been  a  clear  error  of \njudgment.”  Brazos  Elec.  Power  Co-op.  v.  FERC,  205  F.3d  235,  240  (Sth  Cir.  2000)  (citation  and \ninternal  punctuation  omitted). \nThe  APA  also  permits  a  reviewing  court  to  “compel  agency  action  unlawfully  withheld  or \n-9-\nCase  3:07-cv-00945  Documenta  Filed  10/O2/2007  Page  16  of  34 \nunreasonably  delayed.”  5  U.S.C.  §  706(1).  However,  review  of agency  inaction  “can  proceed  only \nwhere  a  plaintiff asserts  that  an  agency  failed  to  take  a  discrete  agency  action  that  it  is  required  to \ntake.”  Norton  v.  So.  Utah  Wilderness  Alliance  (“SUWA  ”),  542  U.S.  55,  64  (2004)  (emphasis  in \noriginal).  The  APA  “empowers  a  court  only  to  compel  an  agency  to  perform  a  ministerial  or \nnon-discretionary  act,  or  to  take  action  upon  a  matter,  without  directing  how  it  shall  act.”  /d.

Plaintiff Lacks  Standing  to  Obtain  Injunctive  Relief  for  Past  Injuries \nPlaintiff lacks  standing  to  request  an  injunction  requiring  HUD  to  set  FMRs  “using  the  [fiftieth] \npercentile  basis.”  Compl.  §  39D.  To  obtain  injunctive  relief such  as  plaintiff seeks  under  the  APA, \nplaintiff must  show  that  it  is  likely  to  suffer  future  injury  by  the  defendant  and  that  the  sought  after \nrelief will  prevent  that  future  injury.  City  of Los  Angeles  v.  Lyons,  461  U.S.  95,  102  (1983)  (“Past \nexposure  to  illegal  conduct  does  not  in  itself show  a  present  case  or  controversy.”’)  (citation  and \nquotation  marks  omitted).  See  also  James  v.  City  of Dallas,  254  F.3d  551,  563  (Sth  Cir.  2001).  In  this \ncase,  HUD  has  set  both  the  FY  2007  and  FY  2008  FMR  for  the  Dallas  Area  based  on  the  fiftieth \npercentile  rent.  Usowski  Decl.  4]  20-21.  Plaintiff has  not  only  failed  to  make  any  allegations  about \nHUD’s  use of  the  fortieth  percentile  rent  to  set  the  FY  2006  Dallas  Area  FMR  but  also  has  failed  to \neven  allege  that  HUD  is  likely  to  set  future  Dallas  Area  FMR  based  on  anything  other  than  the  fiftieth \npercentile  rent.  See  Compl. passim.  Accordingly,  plaintiff cannot  invoke  this  Court’s  remedial  powers \nto  enjoin  HUD’s  past  actions.  Accord Lyons,  461  U.S.  at  102;  James,  254  F.3d  at  563. \n2.  Plaintiff Lacks  Standing  to  Assert  Generalized  Grievances \nPlaintiff also  lacks  standing  to  request  an  injunction  “eliminating  the  disparities  between  the \nnumber  and  percent  of dwelling  units  made  available  in  predominantly  White  rental  housing  markets \nand  the  number  and  percent  of.  .  .  units  made  available  in  predominantly  minority  rental  housing \nmarkets.”  Compl.  §  39D.  Since  plaintiff itself obviously  does  not  allege  that  it  holds  or  has  applied  for \n-10-\nCase  3:07-cv-00945  Documenta  Filed  10/O2/2007  Page  17  of  34 \na  Section  8  voucher,  this  request  cannot  be  construed  as  anything  other  than  an  improper  “sweeping \nrequest  to  generally  eradicate  the  effects  of discrimination.”  James,  254  F.3d  at  568.  See  also \nSchlesinger  v.  Reservists  Comm.  to  Stop  the  War,  418  U.S.  208,  220  (1974)  (“standing  to  sue  may  not \nbe  predicated  upon  an  interest  of the  kind  alleged  here  which  is  held  in  common  by  all  members  of the \npublic,  because  of the  necessarily  abstract  nature  of the  injury  all  citizens  share.”).  Because  such  a \nrequest  “is  not  specifically  targeted  to  remedy  [plaintiff's]  personal  injuries,”  James,  254  F.3d  at  568, \nplaintiff does  not  have  standing  to  pursue  this  claim.  In  James,  the  Fifth  Circuit  addressed  plaintiffs’ \nrequest  that  HUD  be  ordered  “to  remedy  ‘the  loss  of housing  units  caused  by  the  HUD  funded  housing \ncode  enforcement  and  housing  code  enforcement  related  demolitions  of repairable  family  units  as  well \nas  the  resulting  blight.’”  /d.  In  dismissing  the  claim  against  HUD  for  lack  of jurisdiction,  the  Fifth \nCircuit  found  this  claim  was  “‘a  generalized  grievance  shared  in  substantially  equal  measure  by  all  or \nmost  citizens,’”  and,  as  such,  “cannot  provide  standing  to  request  injunctive  relief.”  /d.  (quoting  Warth \nv.  Seldin,  422  U.S.  490,  499  (1975)).  Like  the  James  plaintiffs,  plaintiff's  request  here  to  eliminate \nracial  disparities  in  housing  opportunities  is  nothing  more  than  a  generalized  grievance,  which  is \ninsufficient  to  confer  standing. \n3.  Plaintiff Lacks  Standing  to  Bring  Claims  on  Behalf  on  Its  Clients \nPlaintiff does  not  have  standing  to  assert  claims  on  behalf of its  clients,  that  HUD’s  actions \n“discourag[e]  families  with  which  ICP  works  from  choosing...  units  in  market  areas  that  offer  racially \nintegrated  housing  ..  .”  Compl.  4]  35D.

Moreover,  a  party  seeking  third-party  standing  to  assert  the  rights  of \nanother  may  do  so  only  when  it  demonstrates  a  6G “‘close’  relationship  with  the  person  who  possesses  the \nright,  and  when  it  shows  a  “‘hindrance’  to  the  possessor’s  ability  to  protect  his  own  right.”  Jd.  at  130 \n(quoting  Powers  v.  Ohio,  499  U.S.  400,  411  (1991).  In  this  case,  plaintiff has  not  even  alleged  that  it \nhas  a  “close  relation”  with  its  clients,  or  that  they  have  been  “hindered”  from  raising  claims  themselves. \nSee  Compl. passim.  Accordingly,  plaintiff fails  to  establish  that  it  has  standing  to  assert  claims  on \n-11-\nCase  3:07-cv-00945  Documents  _  Filed  10/02/2007  Page  18  of  34 \nbehalf of its  clients.  See  Kowalski,  542  U.S.  at  131-32  (2004).’ \n4.  Plaintiff’s  Proposed  Remedies  Will  Not  Redress  Its  Injuries \nPlaintiff lacks  standing  to  challenge  HUD’s  actions  because  it  cannot  establish  that  the \njudgment  it  seeks  would  redress  the  injuries  it  has  identified.  “[A]  plaintiff satisfies  the  redressability \nrequirement  when  he  shows  that  a  favorable  decision  will  relieve  a  discrete  injury  to  himself.”  Cramer \nv.  Skinner,  931  F.2d  1020,  1027  (Sth  Cir.  1991)  (quoting  Larson  v.  Valente,  456  U.S.  228,  243  n.  15 \n(1982)).  To  satisfy  the  redressability  component  of standing,  plaintiff would  have  to  allege  (and \nultimately  prove)  that  it  is  “‘likely,  as  opposed  to  merely  speculative,’”  James,  254  F.3d  at  564 \n(quoting Lujan,  504  U.S.  at  561),  that  a judgment  invalidating  HUD’s  FY  2006  and  FY  2007  Dallas \nFMRs,  or  requiring  it  to  use  new  and  varying  FMRs  within  the  Dallas  area,  would  redress  its  injuries. \nSee  Compl.  §  39  Prayer  for  Relief.  This  plaintiff cannot  do. \nFirst,  plaintiff's  request  that  this  Court  “order[]  HUD  to  implement  the  FY  2005  Dallas  area \nSection  8  program  rent  levels  for  the  non-Black  and  non-poverty  concentrated  areas  in  Collin,  Dallas, \nand  Denton  counties,”  Compl.  §  39A,  will  not  redress  plaintiff's  alleged  injuries  simply  because \nHUD’s  FMR  for  the  Dallas  area  for  fiscal  year  2008,  now  in  effect,  is  $871,  Usowski  Decl.  §  21,  and  is \nhigher  than  the  FY  2005  FMR  of $868,  id.,  that  plaintiff has  requested.  Compl.  §  39A.  “To  obtain \nstanding  for  injunctive  relief,  a  plaintiff must  show  that  there  is  reason  to  believe  that  he  would  directly \nbenefit  from  the  equitable  relief sought.”  Plumley  v.  Landmark  Chevrolet,  Inc.,  122  F.3d  308,  312  (Sth \nCir.  1997).  Since  plaintiff cannot  make  this  showing  here,  it  lacks  of standing.  Accord  Steel  Co.,  523 \nU.S.  at  107. \nSecond,  plaintiff cannot  establish  that,  were  this  Court  to  order  HUD  to  establish  separate  FMR \nAreas  for  predominately  White  areas  of the  Dallas  Metropolitan  Division,  Compl.  §]  39B-D,  a \nlikelihood  that  its  clients  would  be  able  to  obtain  housing  in  those  areas.  Plaintiff's  allegation  of injury \nis  an  indirect  one  because  HUD,  by  plaintiff's  own  admission,  through  the  voucher  program,  “assist[s] \nvery-low  income  families  [with]  find[ing]  and  pay[ing]  for  .  .  .  housing  in  the private  housing  market, \n  \n’  Nor  is  it  the  case  that plaintiff may  assert  associational  standing  to  raise  the  claims  of its  client.  See \nJuvenile Matters  Trial Lawyers Ass’n  v.  Judicial Dep’t,  363  F.  Supp.  2d 239,  247  (D.  Conn.  2005)  (associa- \ntion  cannot  claims  on behalf of its  clients  but  only  its  members). \n-12-\nCase  3:07-cv-00945  Documenta  Filed  10/O2/2007  Page  19  of  34 \nCompl.  §  4  (emphasis  added),  rather  than  directly  providing  housing  to  these  families.  Thus,  if \nplaintiff’s  clients  are  unable  to  find  housing  with  a  Section  8  voucher,  it  would  be  because  the  private \nowners of  the  apartments,  and  not  defendant,  had  not  selected  them.  See  42  U.S.C.  §  1437f(0)(6)(B); \n24  C.F.R.  §  982.307(a)(2). \n“lI ]ndirectness  of injury,  while  not  necessarily  fatal  to  standing,  ‘may  make  it substantially \nmore  difficult  to  meet  the  minimum  requirement  of Art.  III:  To  establish  that,  in  fact,  the  asserted \ninjury  was  the  consequence  of the  defendant/[’s]  actions,  or  that  prospective  relief will  remove  the \nharm.’”  Simon,  426  U.S.  at  44-45  (emphasis  added)  (quoting  in part  Warth,  422  U.S.  at  505).  As  the \nSupreme  Court  explained  in  Lujan  v.  Defenders  of Wildlife: \nWhen  ...a  plaintiff's  asserted  injury  arises  from  the  government’s  allegedly  unlawful \nregulation  (or  lack  of regulation)  of someone  else,  much  more  is  needed.  In  that \ncircumstance,  causation  and  redressability  ordinarily  hinge  on  the  response  of the \nregulated  (or  regulable)  third  party  to  the  government  action  or  inaction  —  and  perhaps \non  the  response  of others  as  well.  The  existence  of one  or  more of the  essential \nelements  of standing  depends  on  the  unfettered  choices  made  by  independent  actors  not \nbefore  the  courts  and  whose  exercise  of broad  and  legitimate  discretion  the  courts \ncannot  presume  to  control  or  to  predict.  ... \n504  U.S.  at  562  (emphasis  by  court)  (quotation  and  citation  omitted).  Because  the  PHAs  set  the \npayment  standard  amount,  and  because  it  is  the  private  landlords  in  predominantly  White  areas  who \ndirectly  cause  plaintiff's  alleged  injury,  presumably  because  they  lowered  their  participation  rates  in  the \nSection  8  program,  plaintiffs  burden  to  establish  standing  is  “substantially  more  difficult.”  Simon,  426 \nU.S.  at  44-45. \nIn  this  case,  nothing  in  Section  8  program  requires  a  landlord  in  a  predominately  White  area  to \naccept  plaintiff's  clients  as  renters,  regardless  of the  FMR  set  by  HUD  or  the  payment  standard  amount \nset  by  the  PHA  for  Section  8  vouchers  holders.  In  order  to  encourage  owner  participation  in  the \nhousing  voucher  program,  nothing  in  the  Housing  Act  nor  in  its  implementing  regulations  requires  an \napartment  owner  to  select  an  eligible  tenant.  42  U.S.C.  §  1437f(d)(1)(A);  id.  §  1437f(0)(6)(B).  See \nalso  24  C.F.R.  §  982.307(a)(2);  id.  §  982.452.  As  the  Eighth  Circuit  has  noted  about  the  Section  8 \nprogram,  “the  tenant-selection  process  is  subtle  and  depends  on  an  amalgam  of elements,  some  of \nwhich  are  factual  but  many  of which  are  purely  subjective  appraisals  by  the  [private  owners]  based \nupon  their  experience  with  the  difficult  and  sensitive  task  of evaluating  the  [responsibility  of tenant \n-13-\nCase  3:07-cv-00945  Documenta  Filed  10/O2/2007  Page  20  of  34 \napplicants]....  [T]here  is  no  set  of facts  which,  if shown,  mandate  a  decision  favorable  to  the \nindividual.”  Hill  v.  Group  Three  Hous.  Dev.  Corp.,  799  F.2d  385,  393  (8th  Cir.  1986).  Further, \nnowhere  in  the  Section  8  nor  in  its  regulations  is  it  specified  that  a  PHA  must  even  enter  into  contracts \nwith  owners  to  participate  in  the  program  in  every  part  of its jurisdictional  area.  Williams  v.  Hanover \nHous,  Auth.,  871  F.  Supp.  527,  532  (D.  Mass.  1994).  Nor  does  HUD  delineate  precisely  how  a  PHA \nshould  determine  its jurisdictional  area.  /d.  Thus,  plaintiff cannot  make  the  “substantially  more \ndifficult  showing”  of a  likelihood  that  a  favorable judgment  will  result  in  more  apartment  owners  in \npredominantly  White  areas  participating  in  the  Section  8  program,  or  that  owners  in  predominantly \nWhite  areas  already  participating  in  the  Section  8  program  will  increase  their  participation,  in  such  a \nway  as  to  allow  one  of plaintiff's  clients  to  move  into  such  an  area,  or  move  into  such  an  area  at  less \ncost  of time  and  financial  resources  to  plaintiff.  Simon,  426  U.S.  at  44-45. \nTo  be  clear,  the  ability  of the  remainder  of plaintiff's  requested  relief to  remedy  its  injuries  is \ndependent  on  plaintiff's  mere  speculation  regarding  what  private  owners  “might”  do  if HUD’s \ndetermination  of the  Dallas  FMR  Area  is  enjoined,  and  constitutes  exactly  the  type  of impermissible \nspeculation  the  courts  have  held  insufficient  to  establish  standing.  For  example,  in  Allen  v.  Wright, \n468  U.S.  737,  751,  758  (1984),  the  Supreme  Court  held  that  it  was  overly  speculative  as  to  whether \nrequiring  the  IRS  to  enforce  its  rules  which  prohibited  tax  breaks  to  racially  discriminatory private \nschools,  would  prevent  segregated  schools,  because  withdrawal  of tax  breaks  would  not  necessarily \nconvince  these  private  schools  to  change  policies,  or  convince  parents  to  transfer  their  children  to \nnonsegregated  schools.  /d.  Similarly,  in  Simon,  426  U.S.  at  43-44  (1976),  the  Court  held  that  it  was \noverly  speculative  to  conclude  that  suspending  tax  benefits  to private  hospitals  would  force  those \nhospitals  to  take  on  more  indigent  patients.  Jd. \nFurther,  Burton  v.  Cent.  Interstate  Low-Level Radioactive  Waste  Compact  Com’n,  23  F.3d  208 \n(8th  Cir.  1994),  addressed  claims  by  plaintiffs  seeking  an  injunction  against  a  government’s  taxation  of \npublic  power  entities.  /d.  209-10.  In  holding  that  plaintiffs  lacked  standing,  the  Eighth  Circuit  held \nthat,  even  though  plaintiffs  might  by  able  to  establish  the  traceability  prong  of standing,  by  showing \nthat  “LES  [a  third  party]  increased  electricity  rates  in  response  to  the  [defendant’s]  taxes  on  LLRW \n[another  third  party],”  it  was  still  “not  by  itself enough  to  confer  standing  on  [plaintiffs].”  Jd. \n-14-\nCase  3:07-cv-00945  Documenta  Filed  10/O2/2007  Page  21  of  34 \n(emphasis  added)  The  Court  explained  that: \n[a]lthough  increased  rates  may  constitute  an  injury  that  is  traceable  to  the  [defendant’s] \nconduct,  [plaintiff has]  not  alleged  that  the  injury  is  likely  to  be  redressed  by  a  favorable \ndecision.  The  complaint  asks  the  court  to  ‘redress  [plaintiff's]  injuries’  by  declaring  the \n[defendant’s]  policies  illegal  and  issuing  an  injunction  preventing  the  [defendant]  ‘from \nany  further  and  future  perversion  of its  legal  duties.’  [Plaintiff]  apparently  would  have \nus  take  it  on  faith  that  LES,  which  is  not  a  party  to  this  action,  would  adjust  its  rates  if \nthe  district  court  enjoined  the  [defendant’s]  taxes  on  LLRW  ...  Thus,  it  is  “merely \nspeculative”  here  whether  a  favorable  decision  would  affect  the  electricity  rate  that \n[plaintiff]  pays. \nId.  at  210  (emphasis  in  original).  See  also  Haile  v.  Town  of Addison,  264  F.  Supp.  2d  464,  467  (N.D. \nTex.  2003)  (“Plaintiff has  made  no  showing  that  if the  Court  found  the  tax  to  be  illegal,  that  the  [third- \nparty]  fuel  providers,  who  are  not  subject  to  this  action,  would  decrease  the  price  of fuel  by  $0.12.”). \nLike  the  Allen,  Simon,  Burton  and  Haile  plaintiffs,  even  if plaintiff here  could  establish  that  private \nowners  in  predominantly  White  areas  have  reduced  their  participation  in  the  Dallas  area  PHAs’ \nvoucher  programs  because  of HUD’s  use of  the  Dallas  MSA  to  calculate  the  FMR,  it  remains  merely \nspeculative  whether  those  same  owners  would  increase  their  participation  in  the  Dallas  area  PHAs’ \nvoucher  programs  if this  Court  were  to  set  aside  HUD’s  determination. \nIn  sum,  plaintiff cannot  obtain  injunctive  relief for  past  injuries,  cannot  assert  generalized \ngrievances,  and  cannot  assert  claims  on  behalf of its  clients.  Moreover,  none  of the  redress  sought  by \nplaintiff for  its  remaining  claims  would  likely  redress  any  of plaintiff's  injuries.  Accordingly,  plaintiff \nlacks  standing  to  pursue  its  claims,  and  this  action  must  be  dismissed  against  HUD  for  lack  of subject \nmatter jurisdiction. \nB.  Plaintiff’s  Challenges  to  HUD’s  Past  Fair  Market  Rents  Are  Moot \nPlaintiff's  challenges  to  HUD’s  FMR  for  the  Dallas  area  for  both  FY  2006  and  FY  2007, \nCompl.  9  12,  39A,  are  moot.  “A  precondition  to  asserting  a  claim  for  a  declaratory judgment  is  that  a \nviable  case  or  controversy  exist.”  Hainze  v.  Richards,  207  F.3d  795,  802  (Sth  Cir.  2000).  Plaintiff has \nrequested  this  Court  set  aside  HUD’s  Dallas  area  FMRs  for  both  FY  2006  and  FY  2007.  However, \nbecause  HUD’s  fiscal  year  ends  on  September  30 of  the  calendar  year,  42  U.S.C.  §  1437f(c)(1); \nUsowski  Decl.  §  3,  its  FY  2008  FMR  is  now  in  effect.  /d.  421.  Accordingly,  no  case  or  controversy \nremains  before  this  Court  concerning  HUD’s  FY  2006  and  2007  FMRs.  See  Richland Park \nHomeowners  Ass’n,  Inc.  v.  Pierce,  671  F.2d  935,  942  (Sth  Cir.  1982)  (“In  view  of the  fact  that  the \n-15-\nCase  3:07-cv-00945  Documenta  Filed  10/O2/2007  Page  22  af  34 \ncomplex  has  been  built  and  the  construction  company  has  been  paid,  we  see  no  way  that  HUD’s \nalready-satisfied  construction  financing  commitments  can  now  be  ‘set  aside.’  ..  .  Thus,  at  least  with \nrespect  to  this  aspect  of the  plaintiffs’  claim  for  relief,  the  claim  is  now  moot.”). \nTo  be  clear,  this  is  not  a  case  in  which  plaintiff has  sought  a  declaration  that  HUD’s  past \npractices  violated  the  Housing  Act  or  Fair  Housing  Act.  Cf  Christopher  Vill.,  Ltd.  v.  Retsinas,  190 \nF.3d  210,  315  (Sth  Cir.  1999).  Rather,  by  seeking  only  prospective  relief for  past  actions,  Compl.  ¥  39, \nplaintiff's  claims  concerning  HUD’s  FY  2006  and  FY  2007  FMRs  for  the  Dallas  area  are  moot,  and \nthis  Court  cannot  “read  into  [plaintiff's]  complaint  additional  requests  for  relief and  then  proceed  to  an \nadjudication  on  the  merits.”  Harris  v.  City  of Houston,  151  F.3d  186,  191  (Sth  Cir.  1998))  (quotation \nmarks  omitted).  Accordingly,  this  Court  should  dismiss  plaintiff's  challenges  to  HUD’s  past  rent \nsetting  policies  as  moot. \nII.  THIS  COURT  HAS  NO  JURISDICTION  OVER  PLAINTIFF’S  CLAIMS  BECAUSE \nTHE  APA  PROVIDES  NO  WAIVER  OF  SOVEREIGN  IMMUNITY  HERE \nA.  HUD?’s  Determination  of the  Dallas  Market  Area  Is  Committed  to  Agency \nDiscretion  and  is  Unreviewable  by  this  Court \nEven  without  regard  to  plaintiff's  standing  problems,  plaintiff cannot  obtain  relief under  the \nAPA  because  its  waiver  of sovereign  immunity  is  unavailable  to  plaintiff.  The  APA’s  waiver  of \nsovereign  immunity  allows  any  person  “adversely  affected  or  aggrieved  by  agency  action  within  the \nmeaning  of a  relevant  statute”  to  obtain  “judicial  review  thereof,”  5  U.S.C.  §  702,  but  the  Act  precludes \njudicial  review  when  the  “agency  action  is  committed  to  agency  discretion  by  law.”  /d.  §  701(a)(2). \nAn  action  is  committed  to  agency  discretion  when  “no  judicially  manageable  standards  are  available  for \njudging  how  and  when  an  agency  should  exercise  its  discretion...  .”  Heckler,  470  U.S.  at  830.  In \nHeckler,  the  Court  explained  the  exception’s  limitation  on  the judicial  review  available  under  the  APA: \n[E]ven  where  Congress  has  not  affirmatively  precluded  review,  review  is  not  to  be  had \nif the  statute  is  drawn  so  that  a  court  would  have  no  meaningful  standard  against  which \nto  judge  the  agency’s  exercise  of discretion.  In  such  a  case,  the  statute  (“law”)  can  be \ntaken  to  have  “committed”  the  decisionmaking  to  the  agency’s judgment  absolutely. \nThis  construction  avoids  conflict  with  the  “abuse  of discretion”  standard  of review  in \n§  706—if no  judicially  manageable  standards  are  available  for judging  how  and  when  an \nagency  should  exercise  its  discretion,  then  it  is  impossible  to  evaluate  agency  action  for \n“abuse  of discretion.” \n470  U.S.  at  830.  Thus,  only  if Congress  “has  provided  meaningful  standards  for  defining  the  limits  of \n-16-\nCase  3:07-cv-00945  Documenta  Filed  10/O2/2007  Page  23  of  34 \n[agency]  discretion”  is  there  “law  to  apply”  under  §  701(a)(2).  Heckler,  470  U.S.  at  834.  Accordingly, \nthe  Court  has  “emphasized  that  §  701(a)(2)  requires  careful  examination  of the  statute  on  which  the \nclaim  of agency  illegality  is  based.”  Webster  v.  Doe,  486  U.S.  592,  600  (1988). \nAlthough  the  APA’s  exception  to judicial  review  is  “very  narrow,”  it  applies  “in  those  rare \ninstances  where  ‘statutes  are  drawn  in  such  broad  terms  that  in  a  given  case  there  is  no  law  to  apply.’” \nCitizens  to  Preserve  Overton  Park,  Inc.  v.  Volpe,  401  U.S.  402,  410  (1971)  (citing  S.  Rep.  No.  752, \n79th  Cong.,  lst  Sess.,  26  (1945)).  See  also  Suntex  Dairy  v.  Block,  666  F.2d  158,  163-64  (Sth  Cir. \n1982).  Of course,  an  agency’s  own  regulations  may  provide  the  requisite  “law  to  apply,”  if those \nregulations  provide  standards  for  a  court  to  apply  or  require  an  evidentiary  record.  Ellison  v.  Connor, \n153  F.3d  247,  251,  253  (Sth  Cir.  1998)  (citing  cases).  By  contrast,  “statements  issued  by  an  agency  to \nadvise  the  public  prospectively  of the  manner  in  which  the  agency  proposes  to  exercise  a  discretionary \npower,”  Lincoln v.  Vigil,  508  U.S.  182,  197  (1993)  (quotation  marks  and  citation  omitted),  are \nunreviewable.  In  addition,  the  Fifth  Circuit  has  determined  that  practical  policy  issues  also  should  be \nconsidered.  See  Bullard  v.  Webster,  623  F.2d  1042,  1046  (Sth  Cir.  1980)  (“[t]here  must  be  a  weighing \nof the  need  for,  and  feasibility  of,  judicial  review  versus  the  potential  for  disruption  of the \nadministrative  process.”). \nIn  addressing  Section  8’s  project-based  assistance  program,  the  Fifth  Circuit  has  noted  that  the \ncircuit  courts  have  unanimously  held  that  Congress  has  committed  to  HUD  full  discretion  in \ndetermining  whether  to  grant  or  deny a  rent  increase  in  its  administration  of the  Section  8  program  and \nthat  the  decision  on  the  amount  of any  increase  is  unreviewable.  See  Christopher  Vill.,  Ltd.  P’ship,  190 \nF.3d  at  315.  The  court  further  noted  that,  in  determining  rent  increase  requests,  HUD  must  delicately \nbalance  the  competing  interests  of the  property  owner,  the  tenants,  and  the  federal  government  as  payor \nof the  Section  8  subsidy.  /d.  Because  of the  lack  of judicially  manageable  standards,  the  Fifth  Circuit \nconcluded  that  courts  should  generally  refuse  to  review  HUD’s  substantive  decisions  regarding  a  rent \nincrease.  /d.  (citation  omitted).  In  addition,  the  court  found  that  HUD  must  also  take  into  account \nfactors  that  bear  on  rental  rates  such  as  property  taxes,  utility  rates,  and  the  average  rental  rate  in  the \narea,  see  42  U.S.C.  §  1437f (c)(2)(B),  which  the  courts  are  ill-equipped  to  second  guess.  Christopher \nVill.,  190  F.3d  at  315. \n-17-\nCase  3:07-cv-00945  Documenta  Filed  10/O2/2007  Page  24  of  34 \nMoreover,  the  Fifth  Circuit  has  expressly  held  agency  actions  unreviewable  in  situations  like \nthe  present  dispute.  In  Suntex Dairy,  the  court  addressed  a  statute  that  required  USDA  to  decide \nwhether  issuance  of an  order  would  “tend  to  effectuate  the  declared  policy”  of the  relevant  Act,  which \nwas,  inter  alia,  to  regulate  milk  marketing.  Suntex Dairy,  666  F.2d  at  160-61.  The  court  found  that, \neven  though  one  statutory  provision  did  not  grant  complete  discretion  to  the  agency,  because  it  also \nrequired  the  agency  to  hold  a  public  hearing  and  imposed  “rigorous  obligations  on  the  [agency]  to \ndevelop  an  evidentiary  record”  to  support  its  determination,  id.  at  164,  another  provision  of the  same \nlaw  only  required  the  agency  to  determine  whether  a  proposed  order  was  6G “‘the  only  practical  means  of \nadvancing  the  interests  of the  producers.’”  /d.  at  161  (quoting  regulations).  The  court  held  that  this \nsecond  provision  gave  the  agency  unreviewable  discretion  because  it  did  not  require  the  consideration \nof specific  factors,  the  making  of findings,  or  the  development  of any  additional  evidentiary  record.  Id. \nat  164-65.  In  so  holding,  the  court  found  that  without  required  findings  or  an  evidentiary  record,  the \njudiciary  was  in  no  position  to  gainsay  the  agency’s  determination  as  arbitrary,  capricious,  or  an  abuse \nof discretion.  /d.  at  166. \nIn  Ellison,  153  F.3d  247,  the  Fifth  Circuit  addressed  an  Army  Corps  of Engineers’  refusal  to \nissue  permits  allowing  plaintiffs  to  build  camp-homes  on  their  property  in  the  Atchafalaya  floodway. \nId.  at  249,  Examining  both  the  authorizing  statute  and  the  agency’s  regulations,  the  court  found,  first, \nthat  the  authorizing  statute  did  not  contain  any  standards  or  evidentiary  requirements  governing  the \nissuance  of regulations  and,  second,  that  the  regulation  itself did  not  contain  any  standards  governing \nthe  agency’s  decisionmaking.  /d.  at  253.  Rather,  the  regulation  simply  required  the  agency  to \ndetermine  whether  the  property  in  question  will  be  “‘required  for  public  use’” 999  during  the  period  of the \ncontemplated  grant  and  6G “‘whether  the  requested  grant  will  interfere  with  any  operations  of the  United \nStates.’”  Id.  (quoting  regulations).  Because  these  standards  were  so  general,  and  because  the \nregulation  did  not  require  the  agency  to  develop  any  factual  record  to  support  its  determination,  the \ncourt  held  that  the  agency’s  refusal  to  issue  permits  was  committed  to  agency  discretion  and  thus \nunreviewable.  /d. \nIn  this  case,  Section  8  of the  Housing  Act  sets  out  HUD’s  authority  to  enter  into  HAP  contracts \nwith  public  housing  agencies,  and  sets  out  the  standards  for  maximum  rents,  rent  adjustments,  monthly \n-18-\nCase  3:07-cv-00945  Documenta  Filed  10/O2/2007  Page  25  of  34 \nassistance  payments,  the  selection  of tenants,  inspections,  and  the  like.  See  42  U.S.C.  §  1437f(c)(1)- \n(2);  id.  §  1437f(0).  Apart  from  authorizing  HUD  to  set  and  adjust  maximum  monthly  rents  “in  the \nmarket  area  suitable  for  occupancy  by  persons  assisted  under  this  section,”  id.  §  1437f(c)(1)  (emphasis \nadded),  the  statute  provides  absolutely  no  standards  and  requires  no  evidentiary  findings  on  which  a \ncourt  could  base  its  review  of the  rationality  of HUD’s  determination  of what  constitutes  such  a \n“market  area.”  Cf  Christopher  Vill.,  190  F.3d  at  315;  Suntex  Dairy,  666  F.2d  at  164-65.  Indeed,  the \nstatute  does  not  even  define  what  a  market  area  is,  and  the  circuit  courts,  as  noted  above,  have \nunanimously  held  that  HUD’s  rent  adjustments  are  unreviewable  determinations  that  are  committed  to \nagency  discretion.  Christopher  Vill.,  190  F.3d  at  315.  Thus,  the  Housing  Act  commits  the \ndetermination  of what  constitutes  a  market  area  to  HUD’s  discretion. \nSimilarly,  HUD’s  Section  8  implementing  regulations  set  out  HUD’s  procedures  for  setting  and \nadjusting  FMRs,  see  24  C.F.R.  §  888,  and  govern  the  rest  of the  Section  8  program.  See  id.  §  982. \nAgain,  however,  apart  from  simply  defining  an  FMR  Area  as  an  OMB  Metropolitan  Statistical  Area, \nid.  §  888.113(d),  and  granting  HUD  the  authority  make  exceptions  to  it  (which  it  has  done  here  in \ncreating  the  Dallas  FMR  Area),  see  id.,  HUD’s  regulations  provide  absolutely  no  standards  and \nrequires  no  evidentiary  findings  on  which  this  Court  could  base  its  review  of HUD’s  determination  of \nwhat  constitutes  a  particular  FMR  Area.  /d.  Thus,  like  the  Housing  Act,  HUD’s  implementing \nregulations  commit  to  the  agency’s  discretion  the  determination  of what  constitutes  an  FMR  Area. \nThus,  that  determination  is  unreviewable  by  a  court.  Accord Ellison,  153  F.3d  at  253. \nFurther,  HUD’s  policy  statement  that  “Metropolitan  subparts  of new  areas  that  had  previously \nhad  separate  FMRs  were  assigned  their  own  FMRs  if their  2000  Census  Base  Rents  differed  by  more \nthan  five  percent  from  the  new  OMB  area  2000  Census  Base  Rent,”  70  Fed.  Reg.  32401,  32403  (June \n2,  2005);  see  Usowski  Decl.  §  13,  is just  that,  a  policy  statement—a  “statement|]  issued  by  an  agency  to \nadvise  the  public  prospectively  of the  manner  in  which  the  agency  proposes  to  exercise  a  discretionary \npower.”  Lincoln,  508  U.S.  at  197.  It  is  not  a  binding  regulation,  Ellison,  153  F.3d  at  253,  and  it  does \nnot  require  any  evidentiary  record.  /d.  Thus,  it  does  not  provide  a  sufficient  standard  on  which  a  court \ncould  review  the  rationality  of HUD’s  determination  of what  constitutes  the  Dallas  FMR  Area. \nFinally,  the  same  policy  considerations  that  make  review  of HUD’s  rent  setting  impractical \n-19-\nCase  3:07-cv-00945  Documenta  Filed  10/02/2007  Page  26  of  34 \napply  with  equal,  if not  greater,  force  to  its  determination  of FMR  Areas.  Accord Bullard,  623  F.2d  at \n1046.  Accordingly,  HUD’s  determination  of what  constitutes  the  Dallas  FMR  Area  is  committed  to \nagency  discretion  and  is  unreviewable  by  this  Court.  Thus,  the  APA  provides  no  waiver  of sovereign \nimmunity  in  this  instance. \nB.  The  Court  Lacks  Jurisdiction  Over  Plaintiff?s  Claims  Against  HUD  Because \nPlaintiff Has  Another  Remedy  in  a  Court \nAs  noted  above,  the  APA’s  waiver  of sovereign  immunity  applies  only  if there  is  “final  agency \naction  for  which  there  is  no  other  remedy  in  a  court.”  5  U.S.C.  §  704  (emphasis  added).  See  also \nTransohio  Sav.  Bank  vy.  Dir.,  Ofc.  of Thrift Supervision,  967  F.2d  598,  607  (D.C.  Cir.  1992)  (“Whether \n§  702  of the  APA justifies  .  .  .  jurisdiction  over  [plaintiffs’]  case  depends  on  whether  [their]  claims  fall \nunder  any  of the  ..  .  limitations  on  the  APA’s  waiver  of sovereign  immunity.  The  APA  excludes  from \nits  waiver...  claims  for  which  an  adequate  remedy  is  available  elsewhere.”);  Warner,  487  F.2d  at \n1304  (“Specifically  exempted  from  [APA]  review  is  agency  action  for  which  there  is  some  ‘other \nadequate  remedy  in  a  court.’’’)  (quoting  5  U.S.C.  §  704).  Because  plaintiff has  other  adequate  remedies \nat  law  for  each  of its  alleged  injuries,  the  APA  provides  no  waiver  of sovereign  immunity  here. \nFirst,  plaintiff alleges  that  HUD’s  past  FMR  for  fiscal  years  2006  and  2007  have  injured  it  by \n“increasing  the  amount  of time  per  client  that  ICP  must  spend,”  and  “increasing  the  amount  of financial \nassistance  that  ICP  must  spend,”  “in  order  to  help  its  clients  find  and  retain  modest  rental  housing  in \nnon-minority  concentrated  market  areas.”  Compl.  §]  35B-C.  The  APA  does  not  provide  a  waiver  of \nsovereign  immunity  for  these  injuries  because  plaintiff has  another  adequate  remedy  in  court,  namely,  a \nsuit  for  money  damages  in  the  Court  of Federal  Claims.  See  Warner,  487  F.2d  at  1304.  Congress  has \nprovided  the  Court  of Federal  Claims  with jurisdiction  to  “render judgment  upon  any  claim  against  the \nUnited  States  founded...  upon...  any  Act  of Congress  or  any  regulation  of an  executive  department, \n...  for  liquidated  or  unliquidated  damages  in  cases  not  sounding  in  tort.”  28  U.S.C.  §  1491(a)(1) \n(“Tucker  Act’).  There  can  be  no  question  that  plaintiff's  alleged  past  losses  of “time”  and  “financial \nassistance,”  were  it  to  prevail,  would  be  fully  compensable  in  the  form  of money  damages.  See \nWarner,  487  F.2d  at  1304.  Further,  plaintiff can  make  no  argument  that  these  are  continuing  losses, \nbecause  its  requested  relief is  an  order  for  “HUD  to  implement  the  FY  2005  Dallas  area  Section  8 \n-20-\nCase  3:07-cv-00945  Documenta  Filed  10/O2/2007  Page  27  of  34 \nprogram  rent  levels,”  Compl.  4]  39A,  which  are  lower  than  the  current  fiscal  year  2008  Dallas  area  rent \nlevels.  Usowski  Decl.  4  21.  Accordingly,  the  APA  provides  no  waiver  of sovereign  immunity  here. \nSecond,  §  704  bars  the  remainder  of plaintiff's  allegations  against  HUD’s  rent  setting  policy \nbecause  plaintiff can  maintain  an  action  directly  against  Dallas  area  Housing  Authorities,  alleging  many \nof same  facts  and  seeking  many  of the  same  remedies.  Numerous  circuits  have  held  that  §  704  bars  suit \nagainst  HUD  under  the  APA  when  a  plaintiff has  the  ability  to  pursue  a  remedy  against  a  private  party \nfor  discriminatory  practices  under  §  813  of the  Fair  Housing  Act,  42  U.S.C.  §  3613(a)(2).  See  Turner, \n449  F.3d  at  540;  Godwin  v.  Sec’y  of  HUD,  356  F.3d  310,  312  (D.C.  Cir.  2004);  Marinoffv . HUD,  892 \nF.  Supp.  493,  497  (S.D.N.Y.  1995),  aff'd,  78  F.3d  64  (2d  Cir.1996).  Moreover,  “[a]  legal  remedy  is \nnot  inadequate  for  purposes  of [preclusion  of review  under]  the  APA  because  it  is  procedurally \ninconvenient  for  a  given  plaintiff,  or  because  plaintiffs  have  inadvertently  deprived  themselves  of an \nopportunity  to  pursue  that  remedy.”  Town  of Sanford  v.  U.S.,  140  F.3d  20,  23  (1st  Cir.  1998).  See  also \nMartinez  v.  U.S.,  333  F.3d  1295,  1320  (Fed.  Cir.  2003)  (“The  fact  that  the  complaint  was  untimely \nfiled...  does  not  mean  that  that  court  could  not  offer  a  full  and  adequate  remedy;  it  merely  means  that \n[plaintiff]  did  not  file  his  complaint  in  time  to  take  advantage  of that  remedy.”);  Sable  Commce’ns  of \nCal.,  Inc.  v.  FCC,  827  F.2d  640,  642  (9th  Cir.  1987). \nHere,  HUD’s  regulations  implementing  the  voucher  program  provide  the  Dallas  area  PHAs \nwith  several  options  to  increase  or  decrease  area  rents  in  order  to  increase  housing  opportunities  in  non- \nminority  areas.  Usowski  Decl.  4  6.  First,  the  PHAs  have  the  discretion  to  vary  rents  between  90  and \n110  percent  of HUD’s  published  FMR  (the  “basic  range”),  see  24  C.F.R.  §  982.503(b)(1)G),  and  the \ndiscretion  to  establish  separate  payment  standard  amounts  within  the  basic  range  for  a  designated  part \nof an  FMR  Area.  /d.  §  982.503(b)(1)(i1).  HUD  approval  is  not  required  to  establish  a  payment \nstandard  amount  in  the  basic  range.  Jd.  Second,  the  PHAs  have  the  discretion,  with  approval  from \nHUD’s  regional  field  office,  to  vary  rents  between  110  to  120  percent  of HUD’s  published  FMR  in  an \n“exception  area”  if the  PHAs  can  show  that  median  rents  in  those  areas  are  that  much  higher.  /d. \n§  982.503(c)(2)—i).  Any  PHA  with jurisdiction  in  the  exception  area  may  use  the  HUD-approved \nexception  payment  standard  amount.  /d.  §  982.503(c)(1).  Third,  the  PHAs,  with  approval  from \nHUD’s  Assistant  Secretary  for  Public  and  Indian  Housing,  may  set  rents  in  an  exception  area  that  could \n-21-\nCase  3:07-cv-00945  Documents  _  Filed  10/02/2007  Page  28  of  34 \ninclude  up  to  an  entire  county  above  120  percent  of HUD’s  published  FMR  to  help  families  find \nhousing  outside  areas  of high  poverty,  id.  §  982.503(c)(3)-(4)(i)(A),  again  if the  PHA  can  show  median \nrents  in  those  areas  are  that  much  higher.  /d.  Each  of these  payment  exceptions  provide  the  Dallas \narea  PHAs,  and  not  HUD,  discretion  to  vary  rents  appropriately  across  an  FMR  Area. \nTo  be  clear,  the  roles  and  authority  of HUD  and  of PHAs  in  this  regard  are  entirely  distinct. \nProject B.A.SJI.C.  v.  Kemp,  947  F.2d  11,  20  (1st  Cir.  1991).  In  Project B.A.SJ.C.,  the  First  Circuit \nexplained  that: \nHUD  and  [the  PHA]  are  distinct  entities,  each  representative  of a  separate  sovereign  and \neach  with  its  own  mission.  That  these  missions  may  occasionally  coincide  is  not \nenough  to  erase  their  separateness.  Furthermore,  HUD’s  ability  to  direct  [the  PHA]’s \ndisbursements  is  limited  by  a  network  of specific  contractual  and  regulatory  provisions. \nLimited  powers  of this  kind,  without  more,  are  hardly  the  stuff of legal  identification. \n947  F.2d  at  20.8  Here,  because  Congressional  appropriations  for  Section  8  subsidies  provide  a  fixed \nsum  to  each  Dallas  area  PHA,  rather  than  a  set  contribution  for  each  Section  8  participant,  Usowski \nDecl.  45,  the  PHAs  must  decide  for  themselves  how  to  allocate  those  funds,  as  increasing  payments  for \nrental  units  must  either  be  offset  by  decreasing  payments  for  units  in  other  areas,  or  must  be  offset  by \nmaintaining  fewer  Section  8  program  participants.  /d.  Thus,  the  decision  whether  to  vary  the  rent \nwithin  HUD’s  Dallas  FMR  Area  pursuant  to  this  regulatory  scheme  only  lies  with  the  PHAs. \nIf plaintiff believes,  as  it  alleges  in  its  complaint,  that  there  is  a  basis  for  varying  rents  above \nHUD’s  published  FMR  for  the  Dallas  area,  and  it  believes  that  the  Dallas  area  PHAs  are  unreasonably \nrefusing  to  do  so,  plaintiff can  bring  suit  directly  under  Section  8  against  the  PHAs  to  compel  them  to \nimplement  these  variances.  Because  this  would  provide  an  adequate  remedy  to  plaintiff for  the  non- \nmonetary  injuries  identified  in  its  complaint,  see  Compl  4  35,  APA  §  704  bars  suit  against  HUD, \naccord  Turner,  449  F.3d  at  540;  Godwin,  356  F.3d  at  312;  Marinoff,  892  F.  Supp.  at  497,  regardless  of \nwhether  plaintiff ultimately  would  succeed  in  its  suit  against  the  PHAs.  Yown  of Sanford,  140  F.3d  at \n23;  Martinez,  333  F.3d  at  1320;  Sable  Commc’ns of Cal.,  Inc.,  827  F.2d  at  642. \n  \n*  To  be  clear,  the  remaining  holdings  in  Project  B.A.S.I.C.  are  no  longer  good  law  in  light  of SUWA, \n542  U.S.  at  64,  discussed  infra. \n-22-\nCase  3:07-cv-00945  Documenta  Filed  10/O2/2007  Page  29  of  34 \nC.  The  Court  Should  Dismiss  Plaintiff’s  Section  3608(e)(5)  Claims  Because  HUD  Has \nNeither  Failed  to  Act  Nor  Wrongfully  Withheld  Action \nPlaintiff is  not  entitled  to  relief on  its  claims  arising  under  42  U.S.C.  §  3608(e)(5).  Because  this \nFair  Housing  Act  provision  requires  the  agency  to  “administer  the  programs  and  activities  relating  to \nhousing  and  urban  development  in  a  manner  affirmatively  to  further  [its  fair  housing  |  policies,”  id.,  the \nAPA  does  not  provide  for  review  of the  HUD’s  alleged  failure  to  follow  this  provision.  Although  the \nAPA  allows  reviewing  courts  to  “compel  agency  action  unlawfully  withheld  or  unreasonably  delayed,” \n5  U.S.C.  §  706(1),  the  Supreme  Court  has  unanimously  held  that  a  plaintiff cannot  maintain  a  §  706(1) \nclaim  absent  a  mandatory  statutory  obligation  that  an  agency  take  the  specific,  discrete  action  that  the \nplaintiff wants  to  be  taken.  SUWA,  542  US.  at  64. \nIn  SUWA,  the  Supreme  Court  dismissed  an  APA  claim  that  sought  to  compel  the  Interior \nDepartment  to  ban  off-road  vehicles  in  a  wilderness  area,  because  the  statute  at  issue  simply  directed \nthe  agency  to  preserve  the  character  of wilderness  areas.  /d.  at  65-67.  The  Court  began  its  analysis  by \nnoting  that  the  term  “agency  action,”  although  including  “a  failure  to  act,”  is  defined  in  the  first \ninstance  by  reference  to  “a  list  of five  categories  of decisions  made  or  outcomes  implemented  by  an \nagency—‘agency  rule,  order,  license,  sanction  [or]  relief.’”  /d.  at  62  (quoting  5  U.S.C.  §  551(13)).  The \nCourt  explained  that: \nAll  of those  categories  involve  circumscribed,  discrete  agency  actions,  as  their \ndefinitions  make  clear:  “an  agency  statement  of...  future  effect  designed  to \nimplement,  interpret,  or  prescribe  law  or  policy”  (rule);  a  “final  disposition...  ina \nmatter  other  than  rule  making”  (order);  a  “permit...  or  other  form  of permission” \n(license);  a  “prohibition  .  .  .  or  taking  [of]  other  compulsory  or  restrictive  action” \n(sanction);  or  a  “grant  of money,  assistance,  license,  authority,”  etc.,  or  “taking  of other \naction  on  the  application  or  petition  of,  and  beneficial  to,  a  person”  (relief). \nId.  (quoting  5  U.S.C.  §§  551(4),  (6),  (8),  (10),  (11))  (emphasis  added).  The  Court  then  construed  the \nphrase  “failure  to  act”  as  a  failure  to  take  one  of the  five  agency  actions  earlier  defined  in  §  551(13), \nemphasizing  that  “[t]he  important  point  is  that  a  ‘failure  to  act’  is  properly  understood  to  be  limited,  as \nare  the  other  items  in  §  551(13),  to  a  discrete  action.”  Jd.  at  62-63  (emphasis  in  original). \nThe  Court  then  explained  that  “the  only  agency  action  that  can  be  compelled  under  the  APA  is \naction  /egally  required.”  Id.  at  63  (emphasis  in  original).  Therefore,  “a  claim  under  §  706(1)  can \nproceed  only  where a  plaintiff asserts  that  an  agency  failed  to  take  a  discrete  agency  action  that  it  is \n-23-\nCase  3:07-cv-00945  Document8 _  Filed  10/02/2007  Page  30  of  34 \nrequired  to  take.”  /d.  at  64  (emphasis  in  original).  This  limitation  “rules  out judicial  direction  of even \ndiscrete  agency  action  that  is  not  demanded  by  law.”  /d.  at  65. \nIn  SUWA,  as  in  the  present  case,  the  plaintiffs  alleged  that  an  agency  had  failed  to  comply  with \na  broad  statutory  mandate.  The  SUWA  plaintiffs  claimed  that  a  statute  requiring  the  Bureau  of Land \nManagement  to  “continue  to  manage  [wilderness  areas]  in  a  manner  so  as  not  to  impair  the  suitability \nof such  areas  for  preservation  as  wilderness,”  43  U.S.C.  §  1782(c),  forbade  the  agency  from  taking  a \nparticular  action—permitting  the  use  of off-road  vehicles  in  certain  wilderness  areas.  /d.  at  65.  The \nSupreme  Court  rejected  the  plaintiffs’  assertion,  explaining: \nIf courts  were  empowered  to  enter  general  orders  compelling  compliance  with  broad \nstatutory  mandates,  they  would  necessarily  be  empowered,  as  well,  to  determine \nwhether  compliance  was  achieved—which  would  mean  that  it  would  ultimately  become \nthe  task  of the  supervising  court,  rather  than  the  agency,  to  work  out  compliance  with \nthe  broad  statutory  mandate,  injecting  the judge  into  day-to-day  agency  management. \n...  The  prospect  of pervasive  oversight  by  federal  courts  over  the  manner  and  pace  of \nagency  compliance  with  such  congressional  directives  is  not  contemplated  by  the  APA. \nId.  at  66-67  (citations  and  internal  punctuation  omitted). \nFor  the  same  reason,  plaintiff here  is  not  entitled  to  an  order  compelling  compliance  with  the \nbroad  statutory  mandate  that  HUD  affirmatively  further  the  goals  of fair  housing.  In  the  present  case, \nas  in  SUWA,  the  statute  under  which  plaintiff have  filed  suit  “is  mandatory  as  to  the  object  to  be \nachieved,  but  it  leaves  [the  agency]  a  great  deal  of discretion  in  deciding  how  to  achieve  it.”  /d.  at  66. \nPlaintiff does  not  identify  a  circumscribed,  discrete  agency  action  that  42  U.S.C.  §  3608(e)(5)  requires \nHUD  to  take.  Accordingly,  plaintiff cannot  maintain  a  claim  for  agency  inaction  under  §  3608(e)(5). \nBefore  the  Supreme  Court  decided  SUWA  in  2004,  some  courts  reviewing  claims  of agency \ninaction  permitted  claims  under  42  U.S.C.  §  3608  to  proceed  even  if a  plaintiff did  not  identify  a \ndiscrete  agency  action  that  the  agency  was  explicitly  required  to  take.  See,  e.g.,  NAACP  v.  Sec’y  of \nHUD,  817  F.2d  149,  160-61  (1st  Cir.  1987)  (asserting  that  a  court  applying  APA  §  706(1)  “can  compel \nan  official  to  exercise  his  discretion  where  he  has  obviously  failed  or  refused  to  do  so’’)  (citation \nomitted).  This  position  is  no  longer  tenable.”  The  Supreme  Court  in  SUWA  explained  that  if the \nrelevant  statutory  provision  provides  the  agency  with  discretion  regarding  the  actions  it  may  take,  an \n  \n”  For this  reason,  defendant respectfully  submits  that  Thompson  v.  HUD,  348  F.  Supp.  2d  398  (D. \nMd.  2005),  is  not persuasive.  Thompson  did not  even  acknowledge,  must  less  address,  SUWA. \n-24-\nCase  3:07-cv-00945  Documenta  Filed  10/O2/2007  Page  oi  of  34 \nAPA  claim  cannot  lie  for  agency  inaction.  Rather,  “§  706(1)  [of the  APA]  empowers  a  court  only  to \ncompel  an  agency  to  perform  a  ministerial  or  non-discretionary  act,  or  to  take  action  upon  a  matter, \nwithout  directing  how  it  shall  act.”  SUWA,  542  U.S.  at  64  (emphasis  added). \nFinally,  even  assuming  arguendo  that  §  3608(e)(5)  contained  a  mandatory  directive  that  HUD \nfacilitate  fair  housing  opportunities  in  its  Section  8  program,  for  the  reasons  set  forth  in  Section  B  of \nthis  brief,  supra,  it  still  would  not  provide  the  Court  with  any  “law  to  apply”  or  a  meaningful  standard \nagainst  which  to judge  HUD’s  exercise  of discretion.  See  Heckler,  470  U.S.  at  830  (“review  [under  the \nAPA]  is  not  to  be  had  if the  statute  is  drawn  so  that  a  court  would  have  no  meaningful  standard  against \nwhich  to judge  the  agency’s  exercise  of discretion.  In  such  a  case,  the  statute  (‘law’)  can  be  taken  to \nhave  ‘committed’  the  decisionmaking  to  the  agency’s judgment  absolutely.”).  In  this  case, \n§  3608(e)(5)  requires  HUD  to  “administer  the  programs  and  activities  relating  to  housing  and  urban \ndevelopment  in  a  manner  affirmatively  to  further  the  policies  of [fair  housing].”  As  drafted,  this \nsection  does  not  require  the  consideration  of specific  factors,  the  makings  of findings,  or  the \ndevelopment  of an  evidentiary  record;  it  is  therefore  unreviewable.  Suntex  Dairy,  666  F.2d  at  164-65. \nSee  also  Resident  Council  of Allen  Parkway  Vill.  vy.  HUD,  980  F.2d  1043,  1056  n.6  (Sth  Cir.  1993)  (no \naction  under  the  APA  could  lie  for  plaintiffs’  complaint  about  HUD’s  refusal  to  spend  discretionary \nfunds  in  a  particular  way  because  there  is  no  law  to  apply).  Accordingly,  §  3608(e)(5)  does  not  provide \nany  meaningful  standards  to  rebut  the  presumption  of unreviewability  of agency  inaction  or  upon \nwhich  to  base  any  assertion  that  HUD,  under  5  U.S.C.  §  706(1),  must  take  some  specific  action. \nThus,  the  APA  precludes  review  of plaintiff's  claims  that  §  3608(e)(5)  requires  HUD  to  create \nseparate  FMR  Areas  within  the  Dallas  FMR  Area  or  take  any  other  affirmative  action. \nCONCLUSION \nFor  the  foregoing  reasons,  this  Court  should  grant  defendant’s  motion  to  dismiss  for  lack  of \nsubject  matter jurisdiction. \n-25-\nCase  3:07-cv-00945  Documents  _  Filed  10/02/2007  Page  32  of  34 \nDated:  October  2,  2007 \nRespectfully  submitted, \nPETER  D.

Complaint ¶ ¶ 5, 36. Instead,\nHUD uses the Dallas metropolitan area, a region of 12 counties, or a subset of the metropolitan\narea, a region of 8 counties. Complaint ¶¶ 9, The metropolitan area is not a market area.\nComplaint, 9, 11-18. HUD’s own research concludes that “Entire metropolitan areas (particularly\nthe larger ones) also do not constitute single housing markets.” Appendix page 26. By selecting\nthis multi-county region instead of the actual market areas, HUD is able to apply a formula that\ncalculates the maximum rent for the Section 8 program in the Dallas area based on the lower\nrents in predominantly minority markets where many of the neighborhoods are blighted and have\ninadequate public and private services and facilities. These market area rents are then applied by\nHUD to establish the maximum rent that can be paid under the Section 8 program in the higher\nrent predominantly White markets where there are few if any blighted neighborhoods and the\npublic and private services and facilities are better than those in the minority blighted\nneighborhoods. Complaint ¶ 10.1 \nThe disparity between the percent of units made available by the HUD rents in White\nareas compared to the percent in minority areas is large. In the City of Plano only 13% of the two\nbedroom units are available. Plano is 73% White. In contrast, 56% of the two-bedroom units in\nthe City of Dallas are available for Section 8 based on HUD’s calculations. Dallas is 35% White.\nComplaint ¶ 24.\n1 HUD calls the maximum rent the “Fair Market Rent” or “FMR.” The rent is neither fair\nnor market as alleged in ICP’s complaint.\n-1-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945     Document 11      Filed 10/22/2007     Page 7 of 30\nHUD’s rent-setting policy directly and adversely affects ICP by making it more expensive\nand more time consuming for ICP to help its clients find and retain rental housing in non-\nminority market areas. Complaint ¶ 35; Appendix pages 3, 5, 8. ICP claims that HUD’s action\nviolates the obligation in the Section 8 statutes to use market areas in setting the FMR and\nviolates HUD’s obligation under the Fair Housing Act to affirmatively further fair housing.\nComplaint ¶¶ 1-39. The Administrative Procedure Act provides ICP’s claim for relief and waives\nsovereign immunity for the injunctive relief in the complaint. 5 U.S.C. § 702.\nHUD’s suggestion that the APA does not waive sovereign immunity is based on an\nargument that has already been rejected and is contradicted by the plain text of 5 U.S.C. § 702.\nTrudeau v. Federal Trade Com’n., 456 F.3d 178, 183-87 (D.C. Cir. 2006). ICP’s injuries satisfy\nthe standing requirement for injury in fact. Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 167-68 (1997).\nLandlords who will not rent to a potential tenant who is unable pay the landlord’s market rent are\nmuch more likely to rent to a potential tenant who can pay the market rent. ICP’s declaration and\nHUD’s documents establish the causal link between the amount of rent and landlord’s\nwillingness to rent. Appendix pages 2-4, 5-6, 7-8. The presence of third parties such as private\nlandlords whose actions are directly affected by the rent levels set by HUD’s Fair Market Rent\nlevels do not eliminate the causation and redressability factors for ICP’s standing. Id. at 168-69. \nHUD’s argument that Congress has not mandated the use of market areas in the setting of\nFair Market Rents is contradicted by the legislative history, the text of the statutes, and HUD’s\nown regulation. SENATE REPORT NO.  93-693 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4273, 4315 (1974);2 42\n2 “It is intended that HUD will define the ‘areas’ for which fair market rents are to be\ndetermined in such a way as not to include in a single area communities which are characterized\nby significant differences in rentals or construction costs for comparable housing.” SENATE\nREPORT NO. 93-693 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4273, 4315 (1974). \n-2-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945     Document 11      Filed 10/22/2007     Page 8 of 30\nU.S.C. § 1437f(o)(1)(B); 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(c)(1); 24 C.F.R. § 888.113(a). These sources and\nothers provide the Court with law to apply in the judicial review of HUD’s action failing to use\nmarket areas when setting Fair Market Rents. HUD’s argument that its obligation to affirmatively\nfurther fair housing is not subject to judicial review under the APA is not the law and has been\nrejected in other HUD cases. Darst-Webbe Tenant Ass’n Bd. v. St. Louis Housing Authority,  417\nF.3d 898, 906-909 (8th Cir. 2005). Damage suits against the federal governmentand local suits\nagainst private landlords and public housing agencies cannot provide the relief requested in this\ncase - requiring HUD to use market areas in the setting of Fair Market Rents for the Dallas area.\nThese alternatives do not strip the Court of its jurisdiction to hear the APA claims. Bowen v.\nMassachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 904-905 (1988). This brief also responds to HUD’s other\narguments.\nArgument\nDespite the declaration filed by HUD, most of the facts in ICP’s complaint remain\nundisputed for the purpose of deciding HUD’s motion to dismiss.\nMotions brought pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) address the jurisdiction of the court\nover the subject matter of the complaint. When deciding a Rule 12(b)(1) motion the district court\nmay look at (1) the complaint alone, presuming the allegations to be true; (2) the complaint\nsupplemented by undisputed facts evidenced in the record; or (3) the complaint supplemented by\nundisputed facts plus the court’s resolution of disputed facts. Barrera-Montenegro v. U.S., 74\nF.3d 657, 659 (5th Cir. 1996); MCG, Inc. v. Great Western Energy Corp.,  896 F.2d 170, 176 (5th\nCir. 1990), citing Williamson v. Tucker, 645 F.2d 404, 413-14 (5th Cir. 1981); Panchakarla v.\nGonzales, 2007 WL 2325213, *2 (N.D.Tex. 2007).\nThe Fifth Circuit distinguishes between Rule 12(b)(1) motions to dismiss that are “facial\n-3-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945     Document 11      Filed 10/22/2007     Page 9 of 30\nattacks” and “factual attacks” to the sufficiency of the jurisdiction for the complaint. “Facial\nattacks” go to the sufficiency of the pleadings and in deciding such motions, courts take the\nallegations in the complaint as true. In “factual attacks,” evidence outside the complaint is raised\nand the court may decide the motion on the basis of undisputed and disputed facts. Williamson v.\nTucker, 645 F.2d 404, 413 (5th Cir. 1981). When the defendant’s Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss\nraises factual issues, the plaintiff must have an opportunity to develop and argue the facts in a\nmanner that is adequate in the context of the disputed issues and evidence. Id. at 414; Paterson v.\nWeinberger, 644 F.2d 521, 523 (5th Cir. 1981). This may include a hearing, affidavits, and\ntestimony. Menchaca v. Chrysler Credit Corp., 613 F.2d 507, 511 (5th Cir.1980).\nIn this case most of the facts set forth in the complaint are not disputed by HUD’s\ndeclaration. Mr. Usowski describes himself in ¶ 1 and the Section 8 program in ¶ ¶ 2-3, 5-6. In ¶\n4 he makes conclusions of law about whether or not the Section 8 statutes establish a general\nstandard requiring the use of market areas. Mr. Usowski claims that Congress has not done so.\nThe plain text of the law shows that Congress has established a standard requiring the use of\nmarket areas. \nExcept as provided under subparagraph (D), the payment standard for each size of\ndwelling unit in a market area shall not exceed 110 percent of the fair market\nrental established under subsection (c) of this section for the same size of dwelling\nunit in the same market area and shall be not less than 90 percent of that fair\nmarket rental. 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o)(1)(B). (emphasis added).\n The maximum monthly rent shall not exceed by more than 10 per centum the fair\nmarket rental established by the Secretary periodically but not less than annually\nfor existing or newly constructed rental dwelling units of various sizes and types\nin the market area suitable for occupancy by persons assisted under this section .\n. . . 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(c)(1).(emphasis added).\nThis is a dispute of law, not facts.\n-4-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945     Document 11      Filed 10/22/2007     Page 10 of 30\nMr. Usowski gives his version of HUD’s history of setting Fair Market Rents in the\nDallas area in paragraphs 7 through 21. While he glosses over the use of the 12 county area to set\nthe Fair Market Rent levels for the Dallas area, he does not contradict ICP’s statement that\n “Rather than use market areas to establish the fair market rental, HUD uses U.S.\nCensus data for a 12 county region that is not a market area. The twelve counties\nare Collin, Dallas, Delta, Denton, Ellis, Hunt, Kaufman, Johnson, Parker,\nRockwall, Tarrant, and Wise.” Complaint ¶ ¶ 9-13. \nNor does he contradict ICP’s statement that the eight county region used in the Fair\nMarket Rent determination is not a market area. Complaint ¶ 14. Nowhere in his declaration does\nMr. Usowski make the claim that HUD does use market areas to determine the Fair Market Rent\nlevels for the Dallas area. Mr. Usowski does not mention that the 2008 FY Fair Market Rent\nlevels for the three ($1,156) and four ($1,401) bedroom units are still below the FY 2003 Fair\nMarket Rent for the three ($1,176) bedroom units and below the FY 2004 Fair Market Rent four\n($1,425) bedroom units. Appendix pages 9-12.\nMr. Usowski implies that there is little difference between using the 12 county region and\nthe eight county region to compute Fair Market Rents. Declaration ¶ 21. The implication is based\non a 1.8% difference in one set of data used in the calculations. Mr. Usowski does not calculate\nthe difference in the actual Fair Market Rents using the different regions. But even if he had done\nso, it would be irrelevant. The issue in this lawsuit is not the amount of the single Fair Market\nRent level that is used throughout the eight county area. Rather, the issue is there should be\nseparate Fair Market Rent levels for each rental housing market in that area. Some of the\nresulting Fair Market Rent levels for the separate rental housing markets will be higher than the\neight county FMR and some will be lower. But the levels will better reflect the market rents in\nmarket areas. This was the conclusion of both the U.S. Comptroller General and the U.S.\n-5-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945     Document 11      Filed 10/22/2007     Page 11 of 30\nGovernment Accounting Office when they studied HUD’s Fair Market Rent setting process in\n1977 and in 1994. Complaint ¶¶ 28-29.\nMr. Usowski discusses the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) designated\nmetropolitan areas as if it were just understood that these areas should be used in setting Fair\nMarket Rents. He does not disclose OMB’s strong warning against using the areas it has\ndetermined are solely appropriate for statistical analysis for program purposes. \nNonstatistical Program Uses of the Statistical Area Definitions. In periodically\nreviewing and revising the definitions of these areas, OMB does not take into\naccount or attempt to anticipate any nonstatistical uses that may be made of the\ndefinitions, nor will OMB modify the definitions to meet the requirements of any\nnonstatistical program. Thus, OMB cautions that Metropolitan Statistical Area\nand Micropolitan Statistical Area definitions should not be used to develop and\nimplement Federal, state, and local nonstatistical programs and policies without\nfull consideration of the effects of using these definitions for such purposes. These\nareas are not intended to serve as a general-purpose geographic framework for\nnonstatistical activities, and they may or may not be suitable for use in program\nfunding formulas. Appendix page 13.\nMr. Usowski mentions the controversy concerning the proposed 2004 changes in Fair\nMarket Rent area designations. He does not mention that the U.S. Senators for Connecticut\nprotested HUD’s proposal to use countywide instead of city based Fair Market Rent areas in\nConnecticut. Appendix pages 16-18. Mr. Usowski does note that the changes were not\nimplemented. Connecticut still has Fair Market Rent areas based on cities, not the MSA or\ncounty-wide areas. Appendix pages 19-20. \nHUD bases its argument that granting ICP’s requested relief would result in fewer\nvouchers and fewer families housed on Mr. Usowski’s statement this would be the result of\nhigher Fair Market Rents. ICP is not seeking higher Fair Market Rents but is seeking Fair Market\nRents that are based on market areas, not statistical areas. The General Accounting Office found\nthat the use of market areas would result in some higher and some lower rent levels with no net\n-6-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945     Document 11      Filed 10/22/2007     Page 12 of 30\neffect on the number of households served.\nFor those smaller areas where FMR levels increase as a result of the change, either\nprogram costs would rise or the number of assisted households served at current\nbudget levels would diminish. Conversely, for those smaller areas where FMR\nlevels decreased, program costs would decrease or, given a steady budget level,\nthe number of households being served would rise. Overall, these cost increases\nand decreases could tend to net out and have little impact on the total amount\nof assistance payments. U.S. GAO, “Rental Housing Use of Smaller Market areas\nto Set Rent Subsidy Levels Has Drawbacks” June 1994, p.28, Appendix page 22.\n(Emphasis added.)\n  \nThe following facts from ICP’s complaint are not disputed by HUD. As such, those facts\nshould be taken as true by the Court in deciding the motion to dismiss. Williamson v. Tucker, 645\nF.2d at 413-14.\nICP assists DHA Section 8 families who choose to lease dwellings in non-minority areas\nwith counseling and financial assistance. Complaint ¶ 1. DHA’s Section 8 population is 86%\nBlack and 6% White. There are DHA Section 8 households in Collin and Denton Counties.\nComplaint ¶¶ 6, 7.\nHUD uses twelve counties to establish a single FMR for the eight county Dallas FMR\narea. HUD does not dispute that the twelve county area is not a single market area. HUD does not\ndispute that the eight county Dallas FMR area is not a single market area. Complaint ¶¶ 9, 11, 12-\n18.\nBy selecting this multi-county region instead of the actual market areas, HUD is able to\ncalculate the maximum rent for the Section 8 program in the Dallas area based on the lower rents\nin predominantly minority markets where many of the neighborhoods are blighted and have\ninadequate public and private services and facilities. This rent is then applied by HUD to\nestablish a single FMR that covers the eight county Dallas area and is applied in the higher rent\npredominantly White markets where there are few if any blighted neighborhoods and the public\n-7-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945     Document 11      Filed 10/22/2007     Page 13 of 30\nand private services and facilities are better than those in the minority blighted neighborhoods.\nComplaint ¶ 10.\nHUD’s policy and decisions make approximately 70% of the rental units in\npredominantly minority areas available for occupancy by persons assisted under Section 8.\nComplaint ¶ 23. HUD’s policy and decisions make only 30% of the rental units in predominantly\nWhite areas available for occupancy by persons assisted under Section 8. Complaint ¶ 22.\nHUD’s rent setting formula and its application to the Dallas area Section 8 program steers\nBlack DHA Section 8 participants into the predominantly minority areas of the City of Dallas and\naway from and out of the predominantly White suburban cities. Complaint ¶ 25. HUD’s racial\nsteering makes dwelling units unavailable to Black DHA Section 8 participants and perpetuates\nracial segregation in the City of Dallas and in the Dallas area. Complaint ¶ 26.\nIn 1977, the U.S. Comptroller General disapproved HUD’s decision to use metropolitan\nareas and other multi-county regions to set rent levels for the Section 8 program because it\nignored important distinctions between metropolitan central cities and suburban areas as well as\namong suburban areas. The Comptroller General recommended the development of separate rent\nschedules for individual housing submarket areas instead of one rent schedule for an entire\nSMSA or county group. Complaint ¶ 28.\nIn 1994, the U.S. Government Accounting Office found that if fair market rents for the\nSection 8 program were based on smaller geographic areas rather than the multi-county region\nthen rent levels would better reflect the rent levels typically prevailing in thouse smaller areas.\nComplaint ¶ 29.\nHUD’s record of its FMR decision on HUD’s website contains no facts showing that\nHUD has ever considered the effects of its policy and decisions selecting the multi-county areas\n-8-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945     Document 11      Filed 10/22/2007     Page 14 of 30\ninstead of market areas on the availability of dwellings in predominantly White areas for the\nBlack DHA Section 8 voucher program participants. Complaint ¶ 30.\nHUD does not dispute that it first used the 12 county region as the basis for setting\nSection 8 maximum rents in the Dallas area on Feb. 1, 2006. Complaint ¶ 31. \nHUD does not contest the facts setting forth ICP’s standing showing that ICP seeks to\ncreate and obtain affordable housing opportunities in non-minority concentrated areas for Section\n8 families. ¶ 32. ICP provides financial assistance to assist Section 8 voucher holders to find\nhousing in non-minority areas of the Dallas region. The mobility assistance includes negotiating\nwith landlords as necessary to obtain units in eligible areas at rents that are affordable by Section\n8 families and eligible for the Section 8 subsidy. Complaint ¶¶ 33, 34. By making standard\nquality, non-luxury rental housing unavailable in non-minority areas, HUD’s rent setting policy\ndirectly and adversely affects ICP. The policy reduces the number of units that ICP can use to\nhelp its clients find housing in non-minority concentrated market areas, increasing the amount of\ntime per client that ICP must spend in order to help its clients find and retain modest rental\nhousing in non-minority areas. It increases the amount of financial assistance that ICP must\nspend in order to help its clients find and retain modest rental housing in non-minority areas. The\npolicy discourages families with which ICP works from choosing dwelling units in market areas\nthat offer racially integrated housing because of the cost factors involved in such a choice.\nComplaint ¶ 35.\nThe statements in HUD’s brief that “plaintiff cannot show...” a fact or set of facts does\nnot make the issue a disputed fact if HUD has provided no evidence in contradiction. Since HUD\nhas not disputed the majority of the facts in ICP’s complaint, the Court should accept those facts\nas true for purposes of deciding the motion to dismiss. The Court should consider the evidence\nsubmitted by ICP on the few facts that are in dispute. Williamson v. Tucker, 645 F.2d at 414;\n-9-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945     Document 11      Filed 10/22/2007     Page 15 of 30\nPaterson v. Weinberger, 644 F.2d at 523.\nHUD’s agency action at issue in this case is subject to judicial review under the\nAPA.\nThe APA makes “agency action” or failure to act judicially reviewable. 5 U.S.C. § § 704,\n706. HUD implements the rent setting obligations in the Section 8 program statute through\nstatements of general applicability thus meeting the definition of “rule” as a type of “agency\naction.” 5 U.S.C. § 551.\nThe Section 8 statute requires HUD to set Fair Market Rents using the publication and\npublic comment procedures in the Federal Register on an annual basis. 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(c)(1).\nHUD proceeds under specific regulations setting out the methodology for determination of Fair\nMarket Rents. 24 C.F.R. §§ 888.111, 888.113, 888.115. The regulatory method requires the use\nof market areas defined as “the geographic area in which rental housing units are in competition.”\n24 C.F.R. § 888.113(a). HUD’s publication of proposed and final rents states it is doing agency\naction. The most recent publication of the proposed Fair Market Rents is labeled as “ACTION:\nNotice of Proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2008 Fair Market Rents (FMRs).” 72 Fed. Reg. 38398-\n38403, July 12, 2007. The most recent publication of the final Fair Market Rents is labeled as\n“ACTION: Notice of Final Fiscal Year (FY) 2008 Fair Market Rents (FMRs).” 72 Fed. Reg.\n55940-55945, October 1, 2007.\nThe final notices of Fair Market Rents are HUD’s statement of its approval of the Fair\nMarket Rents for the operation of the Section 8 program throughout the entire United States. The\nnotices are given to implement the specific statutory mandates to set annual fair market rents and\nto use the Federal Register publication and comment procedures in setting the annual fair market\nrents. 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o)(1)(B); 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(c)(1). The final notice is HUD’s approval\n-10-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945     Document 11      Filed 10/22/2007     Page 16 of 30\nfor the prices that can be paid for housing using the subsidy provided by Section 8 vouchers. \nUnder the APA, the definition of “agency action” includes the whole or part of an agency\nrule. 5 U.S.C. § 551(13). “Rule” means an agency statement of general applicability and future\neffect designed to implement law or policy and includes the approval of future prices. 5 U.S.C. §\n551(4). ICP claims that HUD has taken agency action through its determination of and approval\nof Fair Market Rents in annual statements published in the Federal Register. ICP claims that this\nagency action was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion and not in accordance with two\nspecific laws. ICP claims that the action was not in accordance with the obligation to use market\nareas when setting Fair Market Rents set out in 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o)(1)(B) standing alone and as\nit incorporates 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(c)(1). ICP also claims that the action was not in accordance\nwith the 42 U.S.C. § 3608(e)(5) obligation to affirmatively further fair housing. ICP is asking the\nCourt to set aside the agency action not in accordance with law and compel the agency action\nusing the market areas and affirmatively furthering fair housing. Complaint ¶¶ 38, 39. The\nagency action and the allegation of agency action taken in violation of the law and the refusal to\ntake the agency action provided for by law in this case supply the elements that were missing in\nNorton v. Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, 542 U.S. 55, 61-63 (2004). \nThe issue of whether there is law to enforce under the APA is addressed below.\n5 U.S.C. § 702 waives sovereign immunity whether or not the Complaint states a\nclaim for relief under the APA.\nThe waiver of sovereign immunity in 5 U.S.C. § 702 is general in its scope and is not\neven limited to suits that state a claim under the other provisions of the APA. \n. . . An action in a court of the United States seeking relief other than money\ndamages and stating a claim that an agency or an officer or employee thereof acted\nor failed to act in an official capacity or under color of legal authority shall not be\ndismissed nor relief therein be denied on the ground that it is against the United\n-11-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945     Document 11      Filed 10/22/2007     Page 17 of 30\nStates or that the United States is an indispensable party. The United States may\nbe named as a defendant in any such action, and a judgment or decree may be\nentered against the United States. . . .5 U.S.C. § 702.\nICP’s complaint is just such an action claiming that an agency, HUD, acted and failed to\nact in an official capacity as the official agency charged with the duty to use market areas to\ndetermine fair market rents. Sovereign immunity has been waived for ICP’s complaint. Whether\nor not there is an APA claim is a different issue that is subject to different arguments and\nauthorities. HUD’s argument combining the question of whether an APA claim is present and the\nwaiver of sovereign immunity is the same argument that has consistently been rejected by the\ncourts. Trudeau, 456 F.3d at 183-187. HUD’s brief gave no reason why this same argument in\nthis case should receive different treatment.\nHUD’s refusal to use the statutorily required market areas to set Fair Market Rents \nis arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion and not in accordance with those statutes.\n ICP is not asking the Court to set a Fair Market Rent for the Dallas area Section 8\nprograms.3 Rather, ICP is asking the Court to order HUD to use market areas as required by\nstatute when it sets fair market rents for the numerous markets in the Dallas area. That issue is\nwithin the scope of judicial review under the APA. Christopher Village, Ltd. Partnership v.\nRetsinas, 190 F.3d 310, 315-16 (5th Cir. 1999). Judicial review is available when “HUD ignores a\nplain statutory duty . . . .” Id. at 315-16. HUD is ignoring a plain statutory duty to use market\nareas when setting the Fair Market Rents. That issue is subject to judicial review just as the duty\n3 ICP’s complaint asks for injunctive relief prohibiting HUD from using non-market areas\nfor rent setting, compelling HUD to use market areas for rent setting, compelling HUD to set\nseparate rent levels for separate rental markets in order to provide equal access to predominantly\nWhite rental housing markets and compelling HUD to consider fair housing opportunities when\nit sets Section 8 rent levels. Complaint ¶¶ 39B-39D. None of the relief asks the Court to set fair\nmarket rents. Complaint ¶¶ 39A-39G. \n-12-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945     Document 11      Filed 10/22/2007     Page 18 of 30\nto consider a request for a rent increase was subject to judicial review in Christopher even\nthough the request to determine the lawfulness of a particular rent was not subject to judicial\nreview. \nHUD does not dispute, for purposes of its 12(b)(1) motion, ICP’s allegations that the 12\ncounty and eight county regions that HUD uses to set Fair Market Rents are not market areas.\nComplaint ¶¶ 9-11, 16.4 The issue at this stage is whether the HUD determination of the area to\nuse to set Fair Market Rents is so committed to agency discretion as to preclude judicial review\nunder 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2). The statute at issue does not leave HUD any discretion. It must use\nmarket areas in its fair market rent determinations. The Section 8 voucher statute provides not\nonly that HUD must use a market area, but that the rent standard must apply to units in the same\nmarket area.\nExcept as provided under subparagraph (D), the payment standard for each size of\ndwelling unit in a market area shall not exceed 110 percent of the fair market\nrental established under subsection (c) of this section for the same size of dwelling\nunit in the same market area and shall be not less than 90 percent of that fair\nmarket rental. 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o)(1)(B). (emphasis added).\nThe subsection (c) referred also requires the use of the market area.\n The maximum monthly rent shall not exceed by more than 10 per centum the fair\nmarket rental established by the Secretary periodically but not less than annually\nfor existing or newly constructed rental dwelling units of various sizes and types\nin the market area suitable for occupancy by persons assisted under this section .\n. . . 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(c)(1).(emphasis added).\nWhen Congress passed the fair market rent statute, it stated that its intent was for HUD to\navoid using in a single fair market rent area communities which were significantly different in\nrental and construction costs.\n4 The undisputed allegations should be accepted as true for purposes of determining this\nmotion. Williamson v. Tucker, 645 F.2d at 413-14.\n-13-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945     Document 11      Filed 10/22/2007     Page 19 of 30\nIt is intended that HUD will define the ‘areas’ for which fair market rents are to be\ndetermined in such a way as not to include in a single area communities which are\ncharacterized by significant differences in rentals or construction costs for\ncomparable housing. SENATE REPORT NO. 93-693 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4273,\n4315 (1974).\nThe undisputed allegations in the complaint show that HUD’s 12 county and eight county\nFMR regions include in a single area communities that are characterized by significant\ndifferences in rentals. Complaint ¶¶ 11-13, 18.\nCongress was clear that “each housing market” was to have its own fair market rentals. \nThe Senate bill required HUD to determine fair market rentals in each housing\nmarket area required to obtain adequately maintained and managed private\nexisting and new rental housing; and on the basis of such determinations, public\nhousing agencies or HUD would establish fair market rentals for assisted units.\nThe House amendment required HUD to establish fair market rentals in each\nhousing market area for new and existing units of various sizes and types suitable\nfor occupancy for low-income families. \nThe conference report contains the House provisions. The conferees believe that\nthe establishment of realistic fair market rentals will be a prime factor in the\nsuccess or failure of the new housing assistance program. In establishing such\nrentals, the HUD Secretary is expected to take into account factual data, analyses,\nand recommendations from community sources familiar with prevailing rents and\ncosts in various market areas; and he should take into account the need to provide\nhousing with suitable amenities and sound architectural design. HOUSE\nCONFERENCE REPORT NO. 93-1279 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4449, 4465 (1974).5\nThe undisputed allegations of the complaint make it clear that the 12 county and eight\ncounty areas are separate and various housing markets that do not have their own fair market rent\ndeterminations. Complaint ¶¶ 14-15.\nHUD’s own regulations further define “market areas” for purposes of fair market rent\ndeterminations. “FMRs are housing market-wide estimates of rents that provide opportunities to\n5 This and the other legislative history, the text of the statutes, and HUD’s failure to show\nthe necessary evidence of acquiescence prevent any inferences from Congressional inactivity.\nRapanos v.

Affirmatively furthering fair housing\nmeans at least that a government must look for barriers to fair housing in its jurisdiction and take\nappropriate actions to overcome the effects of those barriers. 24 C.F.R. § 570.601(a)(2). In this\ncase ICP alleges that a very specific action was unlawfully withheld. HUD did not take into\n7 HUD admitted liability under 42 U.S.C. § 3608(e)(5) in the Walker v. HUD litigation\ninvolving DHA’s public housing and Section 8 program. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of\nLaw: HUD Motion to Modify Remedial Order Affecting HUD, page 3 ¶ 2, filed June 12, 1996\nCivil Action 3:85-CV-1210-R (N.D. Tex.). Appendix page 29.\n-17-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945     Document 11      Filed 10/22/2007     Page 23 of 30\nconsideration the effects of its Fair Market Rent market area determinations on racial\ncomposition and integrated housing choices before it selected the multi-county region to use as a\nsingle “market area” for determining fair market rents for the Section 8 program for the Dallas\narea. These factors distinguish 42 U.S.C. § 3608(e)(5) from the non-reviewable decision to allow\noff road vehicles into wilderness areas. Darst-Webbe, 417 F.3d at 906-909. \nNo other adequate remedy exists that would strip this court of jurisdiction.\nThere must be a “special and adequate review procedure” available before a district court\nloses its jurisdiction under the APA. Bowen, 487 U.S. at 904-905. HUD’s proposed lawsuits by\nICP against HUD for money damages in the Claims Court are the same remedy rejected by the\nU.S. Supreme Court in Bowen. Id. at 904-905. Whether or not there would be Tucker Act or\nother money claims for past damages, no court would have jurisdiction under the Tucker Act to\nprovide the requested injunctive relief. Id. at 904-905. The Tucker Act waives sovereign\nimmunity only for damages in contract. Transohio Savings Bank v. Director, OTS, 967 F.2d 598,\n607 (D.C. Cir. 1992).Unlike the defense contractor in Warner v. Cox, 487 F.2d 1201 (5th Cir.\n1974), ICP is not suing to require the United States to pay vast sums of money to ICP in advance\nof the date set by a contract between ICP and the United States. \nHUD argues that the local public housing authorities can be sued under the Fair Housing\nAct for HUD’s failure to use market areas when setting Fair Market Rents and for HUD’s failure\nto affirmatively further fair housing in its determination of what areas to use in setting those rents\nciting Godwin v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, 356 F.3d 310, 312-13 (D.C. Cir.\n2004) and similar cases. The cited opinions do not apply to this case. For example, in Godwin,\nthe plaintiff had filed an administrative complaint with HUD and against a private party for a Fair\nHousing Act violation. When HUD held that the administrative complaint did not have merit, the\n-18-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945     Document 11      Filed 10/22/2007     Page 24 of 30\nplaintiff sued HUD under the APA for review of the decision not to pursue the administrative\ncase. The courts quite reasonably held that suing HUD would not remedy the discrimination\nalleged to have been caused by the private party. The availability of a Fair Housing Act case\nagainst the party causing the discrimination was an adequate remedy that precluded APA review.\nGodwin, 356 F.3d at 312-13.\nThe local public housing authorities do not cause the discrimination nor do they have the\nauthority to provide a remedy. They have the discretion to set rents at up to 110% of HUD’s Fair\nMarket Rents. The PHAs must have HUD approval for rents above 110% up to 120%. 24 C.F.R.\n§ 982.503(c). HUD has not granted this approval for DHA’s regular Section 8 Voucher  program.\nAppendix pages 31-33, 34, 35-40. But even if HUD approved rents more than 110% of the HUD\nFair Market Rents, it would not provide a remedy because the rents in the various parts of the\nHUD FMR area vary by more than 20%. The two bedroom recent mover rent in the 2000 U.S.\nCensus is the underlying basis for HUD Fair Market Rent calculations. Appendix pages 41, 45,\n51-52. The median two bedroom recent mover rent in the 2000 U.S. Census for Plano is 23%\nhigher than the PMSA rent. The median two bedroom rent for Coppell is 27% higher than the\nPMSA rent. Appendix pages 56-59, 60, 63, 67. 8 \nNo local public housing authority has the either the duty or the obligations assigned to\nHUD under the statutes involved in this case. Lawsuits against the Dallas Housing Authority, the\nMcKinney Housing Authority, the Garland Housing Agency, the Mesquite Housing Agency, the\nFort Worth Housing Authority, and the myriad other public housing agencies in the area will do\nnothing to require HUD to follow its statutory mandate to use market areas when determining the\n8 HUD did grant a 125% increase for 3,200 Walker Settlement vouchers as part of the\nsettlement in the Walker v. HUD case. Appendix page 5.\n-19-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945     Document 11      Filed 10/22/2007     Page 25 of 30\nFair Market Rents that are used by those local agencies. A lawsuit against one of these agencies\nclaiming that it had the power to set its own Fair Market Rents using the market areas within its\narea of operation would be dismissed as frivolous. These suits are not the special and adequate\nreview procedure that can cause a district court to lose its jurisdiction under the APA. Bowen,\n487 U.S. at 904-905.\nICP is not charging private landlords with discrimination. It is not discriminatory to\nrefuse to rent a dwelling unit for less than the market rent being charged to other tenants. The\nprivate landlords do not have the duty or authority to set Fair Market Rents. The private landlords\ndo not have the obligation to affirmatively further fair housing. A suit against an entity that has\nnot been the cause of the injury is not an adequate remedy that would deprive this Court of its\njurisdiction. Bowen, 487 U.S. at 904-905. \nStanding. \nHUD’s refusal to use market areas directly and adversely affects ICP by A) reducing the\nnumber of units that ICP can use to help its clients find housing in non-minority concentrated\nmarket areas, B) increasing the amount of time per client that ICP must spend in order to help its\nclients find and retain modest rental housing in non-minority concentrated areas, C) increasing\nthe amount of financial assistance that ICP must spend in order to help its clients find and retain\nmodest rental housing in non-minority concentrated market areas, and D) discouraging families\nwith which ICP works from choosing dwelling units in market areas that offer racially integrated\nhousing because of the cost factors involved in such a choice. Complaint ¶ 35. ICP’s complaint, ¶\n35, alleges the requisite injury in fact. Bennett, 520 U.S. at 167-68. \nICP is not seeking to establish standing based on the claims of its clients.\n-20-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945     Document 11      Filed 10/22/2007     Page 26 of 30\nHUD’s argument about standing for past injuries elevates a mention of the 50th\npercentile into a separate request for relief that it now claims is moot.\nHUD’s argument that ICP’s request for the Court to order HUD to use the 50th percentile\nstandard is moot is not directed at any actual relief sought by ICP. While the 50th percentile\nstandard is mentioned in the prayer for relief, Complaint ¶ 39D, it is in the context of requesting\nrelief that will give DHA’s Black Section 8 voucher program participants equal access to rental\nhousing in the White rental housing markets.9 The issue of the 50th percentile standard is not\nmoot. The issue has not yet been raised in the case.\nHUD’s use of the 12 county region is not a past action. The 2008 FMRs were based\non the 12 county region.\nHUD’s use of the 12 county region as the basis for setting Fair Market Rents in the eight\ncounty region continues. The calculation for the Fiscal Year 2008 Fair Market Rents states:\nTherefore, HUD assigns Dallas, TX HUD Metro FMR Area the 2000 Census\nBase Rent of Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, TX MSA for purposes of computing\nthe Proposed FY 2008 FMRs. Appendix page 67.\nAlthough Mr. Usowsky’s declaration does not highlight the continued use of the 12\ncounty region, it does not deny it. ICP is not asking for relief from solely past actions. HUD\ncontinues to use the 12 county region as the basis for setting Fair Market Rents.\nHUD incorrectly characterizes ICP’s claim as based on a “general abstract injury.”\nICP’s suit challenges specific HUD actions that inflict specific injuries and adverse effects\nupon ICP.\nHUD’s argument divides the set of possible claims related to HUD’s into only two\ncategories. One category is claims by holders of or applicants for Section 8 vouchers. The other\n9 The request for HUD to use the 50th percentile as a standard for setting rents in the\ndifferent rental markets merely keeps the status quo because this is the percentile that HUD\ncurrently uses in the Dallas area when setting the FMR. \n-21-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945     Document 11      Filed 10/22/2007     Page 27 of 30\ncategory is a “sweeping request to generally eradicate the effects of discrimination” which does\nnot confer standing. The set of claims is not so simple. ICP claims that HUD’s refusal to use\nmarket areas when HUD sets Fair Market Rents injures ICP in very specific ways. HUD’s refusal\nto use market areas directly and adversely affects ICP by A) reducing the number of units that\nICP can use to help its clients find housing in non-minority concentrated market areas, B)\nincreasing the amount of time per client that ICP must spend in order to help its clients find and\nretain modest rental housing in non-minority concentrated areas, C) increasing the amount of\nfinancial assistance that ICP must spend in order to help its clients find and retain modest rental\nhousing in non-minority concentrated market areas, and D) discouraging families with which ICP\nworks from choosing dwelling units in market areas that offer racially integrated housing because\nof the cost factors involved in such a choice. Complaint ¶ 35. Since HUD has not contested these\nfacts, then for purposes of this motion, these facts must be taken as true. Williamson v. Tucker,\n645 F.2d at 413-14.10 \nThese injuries are not abstract injuries all citizens share. These injuries are just as direct\nand just as specific as the injuries that serve to satisfy the constitutional standing requirement for\nfair housing organizations. Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 378 (1982);\nGladstone Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 110-13 (1979); Trafficante v.\nMetropolitan Life Ins. Co., 409 U.S. 205, 208, 211-12 (1972). The APA has similar language\ngiving effect to Congressional intent to include all who have constitutional standing within the\nstatutory standing for the APA. Congress gave the right to APA judicial review to every person\n10 HUD has done nothing to put these facts in dispute for purposes of the Rule 12(b)(1)\nmotion. The statement in the brief that ICP cannot show these facts is the opinion of HUD’s\nattorney and is not enough to erase the presumption of truth that otherwise attaches for a facial\nattack by a 12(b)(1) motion. Williamson v. Tucker, 645 F.2d at 413-414.\n-22-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945     Document 11      Filed 10/22/2007     Page 28 of 30\n“adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action . . . .” 5 U.S.C. § 702. The U.S. Supreme Court\ngives this provision a generous interpretation given the obvious intent of Congress. Federal\nElection Commission, 524 U.S. at 19-20 (1998); National Credit Union Admin. V. First National\nBank & Trust Co., 522 U.S. 479, 488 (1998). ICP’s complaint, ¶ 35, alleges the requisite injury\nin fact. Bennett, 520 U.S. at 167-68. HUD has not challenged ICP’s status as within the zone of\ninterests of both the Section 8 statutes and the Fair Housing Act provision involved in this\nlawsuit. ICP has standing.\nThe need for private landlords in the Section 8 program does not eliminate\ntraceability or redressability since the failure to use market areas has a determinative or\ncoercive effect upon those landlords - if the Fair Market Rents are too low to afford units in\nWhite areas, the landlords will not rent those units to Section 8 families.\nHUD argues that since landlords have the last word on whether to rent to a Section 8\nfamily and since there is no obligation to lease to a Section 8 family, there is no traceability or\nredressability for ICP’s standing. Even if the rent is raised for units in White areas, HUD argues\nthat ICP cannot be guaranteed that its clients will be able to rent those units. HUD’s argument\nimposes a requirement of certainty of results that is not required for standing. \nFor example, a contractor who wants to bid for government contracts but will be\ndisadvantaged by minority and gender based preferences still has standing to challenge those\npreferences. The fact that the contractor may not be the low bidder or otherwise qualify for\ncontracts even if the challenged preferences are removed does not eliminate standing for\ninjunctive relief. Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena,  515 U.S. 200, 211 (1995). Similarly, the\nfact that a challenged biological opinion was advisory and not conclusive did not eliminate the\ntraceability and redressability standing elements for those who stood to be injured if the opinion\nwas adopted. In so holding, the U.S. Supreme Court made the distinction between injury that is\n-23-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945     Document 11      Filed 10/22/2007     Page 29 of 30\nthe result of third parties not before the court and injury produced by determinative or coercive\neffect upon the action of such third parties. Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 168-69 (1997).\nIn this case, ICP has plead that HUD’s action has just such a determinative or coercive\neffect upon landlords in predominantly White areas. Complaint ¶ 35. HUD has already found that\nthe effect of rent levels facilitates the placement of Section 8 families into predominantly White\nareas by making those families more competitive in the Dallas rental market. Appendix page 5.\nHUD’s Section 8 Manual recognizes that the effect of rents being too low for a given market is\nthat families may have a hard time finding acceptable units in more desirable areas, housing\nchoices will be narrowed, and “the PHA’s effort to affirmatively further fair housing will be\nundermined.” Appendix page 8. ICP’s experience shows that if the relief is granted and the\nSection 8 rents in White areas are based on the market rents for those areas, the success rate for\nICP’s placement of Section 8 families will increase. The absence of such market rents is a cause\nof the inability to place Section 8 families with landlords in those areas. ICP states that in at least\n20 instances over the past few months, the only factor that kept its clients from obtaining a\nspecific unit in a predominantly White area was the amount of rent that could be paid under the\nexisting Fair Market Rent scheme. Appendix page 3. \nThe effect of setting Fair Market Rents on market rents in market areas on the probability\nof Section 8 families being able to obtain housing in those areas is not speculative. HUD knows\nand states that it is not speculative. ICP knows and states that it is not speculative. The facts\nbased on the experience of landlord behavior when confronted with a possible tenant who can\npay the rent and with a possible tenant who cannot pay the rent are not speculative. HUD’s cases\nare those finding the possible effects of judicial action suspending tax benefits to hospitals and\nwithdrawing tax breaks to racially discriminatory schools were too speculative to support\n-24-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945     Document 11      Filed 10/22/2007     Page 30 of 30\nstanding. See Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737 (1984); Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rts. Org., 426 U.S.\n26 (1976). Those cases do not show that the effect of offering market rent to a landlord instead of\noffering less than market rent deprives ICP of standing. \nConclusion\nHUD’s motion should be denied. The Court has jurisdiction to decide HUD’s duty to use\nmarket areas for rent setting and to affirmatively further housing. \nRespectfully Submitted,\n            s/ Michael M.

Forthe reasons stated herein, the motion should be granted in part and denied \nin part. \nI. \nPlaintiff The Inclusive Communities Project, Inc. (\"ICP\") is a non-profit organization that \nprovides assistance to minority families participating in the Housing Choice Voucher Program under \nSection 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (\"NHA\"l, as amended, 42 U.S.c. § 1437, el seq. \n(See Plf. CompI. at I, '112 & 9, 'II 32). The mission of the organization is to \"break down barriers to \nthe creation of racially and economically inclusive communities,\"  (ld. at I,  2).  To further this \ngoal, plaintiff provides mobility and financial assistance to low-income African-American families \nwho want to obtain rental housing in predominantly Caucasian areas in and around Dallas.  (Jd.  at \n9-10, '1133). The mobility assistance includes negotiating with landlords to obtain Section 8 housing \n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 22      Filed 07/20/2009     Page 2 of 16\nin eligible areas at affordable rents. (Id). The financial assistance provided by plaintitfto its clients \nincludes the payment of application fees, security deposits, and utility deposits.  (Id). \nUnder the Section 8 voucher program, HUn contracts with local public housing agencies and \nprivate landlords to pay the difference between a fair market rent for the area and the amount paid \nby  the  low-income tenant.l  See  generally,  42  U.s.C.  §  I 437f(0).  HUD  is  responsible  for \nestablishing fair market rents, or FMRs, for the rental housing market area.  See id.  § 1437f(c)(I). \nThe HUn regulations explain how these FMRs are calculated: \nFair Market Rents (FMRs) are estimates of rent plus the cost of \nutilities, except telephone. FMRs are housing market-wide estimates \nof rents that provide opportunities to rent standard quality housing \nthroughout the geographic area in which rental housing units are in \ncompetition.  The level at which FMRs are set is expressed as a \npercentile point within the rent distribution of standard quality rental \nhousing units in the FMR area. FMRs are set at the 40th or 50th \npercentile rent--the dollar amount below which the rent for 40 or 50 \npercent of standard quality rental housing units falls.  The 40th or \n50th percentile rent is drawn from the distribution of rents of all units \nthat are occupied by recent movers. Adjustments are made to exclude \npublic housing units, newly built units and substandard units. \n24 C.F.R. § 888.113(a).  The regulations emphasize that HUn \"uses the most accurate and current \ndata available to develop the FMR estimates,\" including census data and random digit dialing \ntelephone surveys.  See id. § 888.II3(e)(I).  Using this method, HUD annually estimates FMRs for \napproximately 350 metropolitan areas and 2,300 non-metropolitan counties throughout the United \nStates.  See generally. Franconia Assoc. v.  United Slales, 61  Fed. CI. 718, 760 (2004).  The issue \nin this case involves the geographic area used by HUD to detennine FMRs in the Dallas rental \nhousing market. \nI  A tenant family may be required to pay up to 40% of its monthly adjusted income for rent.  See 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1437~oX2XAX;) & (oX3). \n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 22      Filed 07/20/2009     Page 3 of 16\nThe Dallas, TX HUD Metro FMR area is comprised of eight counties, which are carved out \nof a larger Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington metropolitan statistical area defined by the Office of \nManagement and Budget (\"OMB\"). (See Plf. Compl. at 3-4, ~~ 9 & 13). According to plaintiff, this \npractice of using a large multi-county region as the starting point for detennining FMR violates both \nthe NHA, which requires HUD to base FMRs on \"market area,\" and the Fair Housing Act of 1968 \n(\"FHA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 3601, et seq., which imposes an affinnative duty on HUD to promote fair \nhousing policies.  (See id. at II, ~ 37).  Succinctly stated, plaintitfcontends that HUD's practice \nincorporates rents from predominately minority housing markets, where many ofthe neighborhoods \nare blighted and have inadequate public and private services and facilities, and results in lower FMRs \nfor the Dallas rental housing market area, thereby precluding Section 8 program participants from \nobtaining rental housing in more amuent Caucasian areas.  (See id. at 3, ,  10).  Instead, plaintiff \nargues that HUD should use smaller geographic areas to determine FMRs, which would more \naccurately reflect the rent levels in Caucasian neighborhoods and give low-income minority families \nequal access to rental housing in those neighborhoods. (See id. at 6-7,  19).  In this lawsuit, plaintiff \nseeks broad equitable relief, including an injunction: (1) compelling HUD to use smaller rental \nhousing market areas, instead of large multi-county regions, as a basis for delennining FMRs; (2) \nrequiring HUD to establish separate Section 8 program rent levels for separate rental housing \nmarkets; and (3) compelling HUD to \"consider and further fair housing opportunities\" for minority \nparticipants in the Section 8 program when it sets rent levels.  (See id. at 11-12,  39). \nThe case is before the court on defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter \njurisdiction. As grounds for its motion, defendant contends that plaintiff lacks standing to bring this \nsuit and that HUD has not waived sovereign immunity.  The issues have been fully briefed by the \npanies and the motion is ripe for detennination. \n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 22      Filed 07/20/2009     Page 4 of 16\nII. \nThe gravamen of defendant's standing argument is that the remedies sought by plaintifTwill \nnot redress its injuries and amount to nothing more than generalized grievances.2  Because standing \nis a prerequisite to the exercise of federal jurisdiction, the court considers this issue first.  See Cole \nv.  General Motors Corp., 484 F.3d 717, 721  (5th Cir. 2007). \nA. \n\"The doctrine of standing addresses the question of who may properly bring suit in federal \ncourt.\"  The inclusive Communities Project, Inc.  v.  Texas Dept. 0/ Housing & Comm. Affairs, No. \n3-08-CV-0549-D, 2008 WL 5191935 at +2 (N.D. Tex. Dec. 11,2008).  To satisfy the case-or-\ncontroversy requirement of Article HI of the Constitution, the plaintiff must establish that it has \n\"suffered 'injury in fact,' that the injury is 'fairly traceable' to the actions of the defendant, and that \nthe injury will likely he redressed by a favorable decision.\"  Id., 2008 WL 5191935 at +2, quoting \nBennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 162, 117 S.Ct. 1154, 1161, 137 L.Ed.2d 281 (1997).  An injury in \nfact must be \"concrete and ... actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\"  Id, quoting \nLujan v.  Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61,112 S.Ct. 2130,2136,119 L.Ed.2d 351 \n(1992).  Moreover, \"the injury must affect the plaintiff in a personal and individual way,\"  Id. \nquoting Lujan, 112 S.Ct. at 2136 n.1. Stated differently. a party must assert its own legal rights and \ninterests, and cannot rest its claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties. See Warth \nv.  Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 500, 95 S.Ct. 2197,2206,45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975).  For injunctions, the \nplaintiff must also show that it is likely to suffer future injury as a result of the challenged conduct, \n1  Defendant also argues that plaintiff lacks standing to sue on behalf of its clients. that plaintiff cannot obtain \ninjunctive relief for past injuries, and that any claims based on FMRs, other than the FMRs currently in effect, are moot. \n(See Der. Mot. Br. at 10-12, 15).  In its response, plaintiff makes clear that it seeks relief only for its own injuries and \nonly with respect to HUD's current practice of determining FMRs. (See Plf. Resp. 8r. at 20-21). The court therefore \ndeclines to address these other grounds for dismissal.  However, in order to clarity its claims and the nature of relief \nsought, plaintiff should amend its complaint before this case proceeds further. \n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 22      Filed 07/20/2009     Page 5 of 16\nand that the reliefrequested will prevent that future injury.  See James v.  City of Dallas, 254 F.3d \n551,563 (5th CiT. 2001), cerl. denied, 122 S.Ct. 919 (2002), citing CityoJLos Angelesv. Lyons, 461 \nU.S. 95, 102, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 1665,75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983).  However, \"if the injury is accompanied \nby any continuing, present adverse effects, standing for injunctive relief can be found.\"  Id, quoting \nLyons, 103 S.Ct. at 1665 (internal quotations omitted). \nAs the party seeking to invoke federal jurisdiction, plaintiff bears the burden of proving its \nstanding.  See Inclusive Communities Project, 2008 WL 5191935 at \"'2, citing Lujan, 112 S.Ct. at \n2136.  A defendant may challenge standing by filing a Rule 12(b)(I) motion to dismiss.  If the \ndefendant merely brings a Rule 12(b)(I) motion, it is considered a facial attack, and the court looks \nonly to the sufficiency of the allegations in the pleading, assuming them to be true.  See Paterson v. \nWeinberger, 644 F.2d 521, 523 (5th CiT. 1981).  The court must deny the motion if the allegations \nare sufficient to allege jurisdiction.  See Inclusive Communities Project, 2008 WL 5191935 at .3. \nA defendant may also make a factual attack on subject matter jurisdiction by submitting evidence, \nsuch as affidavits and testimony.  See Middle South Energy, Inc.  v. City o/New Orleans, 800 F.2d \n488, 490 (5th Cir. 1986),  When a defendant provides evidence factually attacking subject matter \njurisdiction, the plaintiff must submit evidence and prove by a preponderance of the evidence that \nthe court has jurisdiction.  Id  In the instant case, HUD has submitted an affidavit in support of its \nRule 12(b)(I) motion.  However, nothing in the affidavit challenges any factual matters necessary \nto the detennination of standing. The court therefore treats the motion as a facial attack, rather than \na factual attack, on jurisdiction. See Estate o/Merkel v. United Siales, No. 3-06-CV -1891-D, 2008 \nWL 5378183 at '2 n.2 (N.D. Tex. Dec. 23,2008) (treating Rule 12(b)(1) motion as facial attack \nwhere affidavits submitted by defendant did not challenge any factual matter bearing on jurisdiction); \n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 22      Filed 07/20/2009     Page 6 of 16\nIBEW-NECA  Southwestern Health & Benefit Fund v.  WinsleI, No. 3-06-CV-0038-D, 2006 WL \n954010 at '1 (N.D. Tex. Apr. 12,2006) (same). \nB. \nDefendant contends that plaintiff lacks standing to challenge HUD's practice of determining \nFMRs for the Dallas rental housing market because the injunctive relief it seeks will not redress its \ninjuries.  Under the third requirement of Article 1II standing, plaintiff must show that it is '''likely,' \nas opposed to merely 'speculative; that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\" Lujan, \n112 S.Ct. at 2136.  Although defendant does not directly challenge plaintiffs alleged injuries at the \npleading stage, (see Def. Reply at 2), it is necessary to briefly discuss the nature of those injuries \nbefore examining redressability. \nI. \nA non-profit fair housing organization, such as plaintiff, can establish injury by showing that \nthe challenged unlawful conduct frustrates its mission and requires it to devote significant resources \nto counteracting the discriminatory effects of that conduct.  See Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman , \n455 U.S. 363, 379,102 S.Ct. 1114, 1124-25,71 L.Ed.2d 214 (1989).  Here, plaintiff alleges that \nHUO's practice of using a large multi-county region as the starting point for determining FMRs \nresults in racial segregation in the Dallas rental housing market, thereby frustrating plaintiffs mission \nof promoting equal housing opportunities and requiring the expenditure of more time and more \nmoney to achieve its goals.  (See Plf. Compl. at 7, ~ 26 &  10, 'i\\35).  In particular, plaintiff alleges \nthat HUD's rent setting policy directly and adversely affects its interests by: \n•  reducing the number of units that plaintiff can use to help its \nclients  find  housing in  non-minority concentrated market \nareas; \n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 22      Filed 07/20/2009     Page 7 of 16\n•  increasing the amount of time per client that plaintiff must \nspend in order to help its clients find housing in non-minority \nconcentrated market areas; \n•  increasing the amount of financial assistance that plaintiff \nmust spend in order to help its clients find housing in 000-\nminority concentrated market areas; and \n•  discouraging families who work with plaintiff from choosing \ndwelling units in market areas that offer racially integrated \nhousing because of the cost factors involved in such a choice. \n(See  Plf.  CampI.  at  10, ~ 35).  Similar allegations  of hann  suffered  by non-profit  housing \norganizations have been held sufficient to establish injury for standing purposes.  See, e.g. Havens \nRealty, 102 S.Ct. at 1123-25; Inclusive Communities Project, 2008 WL 5191935 at '4. \n2. \nThe issue raised by defendant is whether the remedy requested by plaintifTis likely to redress \nits injuries. The court has little difficulty concluding that an injunction requiring HUn to use smaller \nrental housing market areas, instead of a large multi.county region, as a basis for determining FMRs \nwould result in higher rental rates in predominantly Caucasian areas of Dallas, thereby expanding \nopportunities for low·income African American families to obtain Section 8 housing in those areas. \nWith more rental housing opportunities available in non·minority areas, plaintiff likely will have to \nspend less time and less money helping clients secure housing in desegregated neighborhoods.  At \nleast at the pleading stage. plaintiff has sufficiently demonstrated that it is likely, as opposed to \nmerely speculative, that its injuries will be redressed by a favorable decision in this case.  See \nInclusive Communities Project, 2008 WL 5191935 at .6.3 \n) This conclusion is bolstered if the court treats defendant's Rule 12(bX I) motion as a factual anack, rather than \na facial attack, on jurisdiction.  In an anempt to counter defendant's argument that the relief requested in this lawsuit \nwould not necessarily expand housing opportunities in predominantly Caucasian areas, plaintiff relies on the affidavit \nof its Mobility Assistance Director, Stephanie McGee, who states: \n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 22      Filed 07/20/2009     Page 8 of 16\nC. \nDefendant further contends that plaintiffs request for a broad injunction eliminating racial \ndisparities in the Dallas rental housing market area is nothing more than a \"generalized grievance.\" \nAt issue is plaintiffs request for: \nan injunction compelling HUD to set separate Section 8 program rent \nlevels for the separate rental housing markets at dollar amounts that \nprovide DHA's Black Section 8 voucher program participants equal \naccess to rental housing in the White rental housing markets.  Equal \naccess is achieved by setting rent levels using the 50th percentile \nbasis for each of the rental housing markets and eliminating the \ndisparities between the nwnber and percent of dwelling units made \navailable in  predominately White rental housing markets and the \nnumber  and  percent  of  dwelling  units  made  available  in \npredominantly minority rental housing markets. \n(See Def. Mot. Br. at 10 & Def. Reply at 2, citing Plf. Compl. at 12, ~ 39D).  Relying on the Fifth \nCircuit's decision in James v. City ofD  allas, 254 F.3d 551 (5th Cir. 200 I), defendant argues that the \ninjunction sought by plaintiff is too general to support Article III standing. \nDuring the period from May 2007 through September 2007 ICP negotiated with 44 \nlandlords in predominantly white areas on behalf of African American Section 8 \nvoucher participants concerning the issues raised by the rent being higher than the \nSection 8 rent as set by HUD Fair Market Rent level. In 20 instances, the landlord \nrefused to lower the rem even though the tenant was eligible !O rent the unit.  In \nthese cases, but for the fact that rents set by the HUD Fair Market Rent levels were \nlower than the rent charged by the landlord, the Seclion 8 participant would have \nrented that specific unit in a predominately while area. \nDuring that same period ICP was able to negotiate with 24 landlords who agreed \nto lower the contract rent for the dwelling unit in order for an African American \nSection 8 participant to rent the unit. In these cases, ICP was only able to obtain the \nrent reduction by paying the landlord a bonus. The bonus was high enough in these \ninstances for the landlord to forego its usual rent and lower the rent charged to the \nSection 8 participam.  ICP has spent 523,686.50 for these bonus payments during \nthis period. \n(See Plf. Resp. App. at 3).  This evidence, ifconsidered by the court, supports the conclusion that the injury alleged by \nplaintiIT-·the increased time and costs associated with helping minority families obtain rental housing in non-minority \nareas--likely would be redressed by an injunction requiring HUOto use smaller rental housing market areas as the basis \nfor detennining FMRs. \n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 22      Filed 07/20/2009     Page 9 of 16\nJames was a class action brought by two African-American homeowners against the City of \nDallas and HUD challenging the demolition of repairable single-family homes in predominately \nminority neighborhoods without proper notice or a warrant, and charging that the \"no-notice\" \ndemolition program was the result of intentional race discrimination. James, 254 F Jd at 558.  In \ntheir complaint, the  plaintiffs  sought,  inter alia,  \"a  pennanent  injunction  requiring  HUD  to \nadminister all  of its  housing programs in  a manner that  will  eradicate  the  effects of HUD's \ndiscriminatory demolition practices[.]\" Jd. at 561. The Fifth Circuit held that this broad request for \ninjunctive relief was not sufficiently targeted to remedy plaintiffs' specific injuries.  ld.  at 568. \nTherefore, the plaintiffs lacked standing to seek such relief.  ld., citing Warth, 95 S.Ct. at 2205 \n(recognizing that a \"generalized grievance\" shared in substantially equal measure by all or most \ncitizens cannot provide standing to request injunctive relief). \nUnlike the injunction requested in James, the relief sought by plaintiff in the instant case is \nnot a \"sweeping request to generally eradicate the effects of discrimination.\" Cf id.  Instead, plaintiff \nasks the court to require HUD to \"set separate Section 8 program rent levels for the separate rental \nhousing markets at dollar amounts that provide DHA's Black Section 8 voucher program participants \nequal access to rental housing in the White rental housing markets.\" (See Plf. Compl. at  12, ~ 390). \nPlaintiff goes on to suggest that \"(e]qual access is achieved by setting rent levels using the 50th \npercentile basis for each of the rental housing markets and eliminating the disparities between the \nnumber and percent of dwelling units made available in predominately White rental housing markets \nand the number and percent of dwelling units made available in predominantly minority rental \nhousing markets.\" (Id.).  Read in its entirety, it is clear that plaintiff does not seek a broad injunction \nto \"eliminat[e] racial disparities in housing opportunities,\" 8S defendant argues in its motion.  (See \nDef. Mot. Br. at  10).  By enjoining HUD from using a large multi-county region as a basis for \n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 22      Filed 07/20/2009     Page 10 of 16\ndetermining FMRs and requiring the agency to set separate fent levels for separate rental housing \nmarkets defined by smaller geographic areas, plaintiffis attempting to further its mission of helping \nlow-income minority families gain access to the rental housing market in predominantly Caucasian \nareas ofDaJlas,  Such relief is targeted to remedy plaintiffs specific injury of having to spend more \ntime and more money to accomplish its goals, and does not seek to redress a \"generalized grievance.\" \nThus, plaintifThas demonstrated Article III standing to prosecute this claim for injunctive relief. \nIll. \nThe court next considers whether plaintiff's claims under the APA, through which it seeks \nredress for alleged violations of the NHA and the FHA, are barred by the doctrine of sovereign \nimmunity.  While recognizing that the APA allows a person to seek judicial review for an alleged \nlegal wrong committed by a federal agency, see 5 U.S.C. § 702, defendant argues that this statutory \nwaiver of sovereign immunity does not apply to plaintiff's claims because:  (I) HUD's rent-setting \npractices are committed to agency discretion by law; and (2) plaintiff has other adequate remedies. \nA. \n\"The basic rule of federal sovereign immunity is that the United States cannot be sued at all \nwithout the consent of Congress. \" St. Tammany Parish v. Federal Emergency Management Agency, \n556 F.3d 307, 316 (5th Cir. 2009), quoting Block v.  North Dakota ex rei. Board a! University & \nSchoolLands, 461 U.S. 273, 287, 103 S.Ct. 1811, 1819,75 L.Ed.2d 840 (1983).  Section 702 of the \nAPA authorizes suits against the United States through a limited waiver of sovereign immunity for \nrelief other than monetary damages related to an agency's regulatory action.  Id.  at 317, citing 5 \nU.S.C. § 702.  However. the waiver does not apply to agency actions that are committed to agency \ndiscretion by law.  /d, ciling 5 U.S.C. § 70 I (a)(2).  This exception to judicial review is \"very \nnarrow\" and applies only \"in those rare instances where 'statutes are drawn in such broad tenns that \n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 22      Filed 07/20/2009     Page 11 of 16\nin a given case there is no law to apply.'\"  Ellison v.  Connor IS3 F.3d 247, 2S1  (Sth Cir. 1998), \nquoting Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 410, 91 S.Ct. 814, 821, 28 \nL.Ed.2d 136 (1971); see also Sun/ex Dairy v. Block, 666 F.2d IS8, 163 (Sth Cir.), cert. denied, 103 \nS.Ct. 59 (1982).  Stated differently, judicial review is unavailable only \"if the statute is drawn so that \na court  would have no  meaningful  standard  against  which to judge the  agency's  exercise  of \ndiscretion.\"  Heckler v. Chaney. 470 U.S. 821, 830, lOS S.Ct. 1649, 16SS, 84 L.Ed.2d 714 (198S). \nI. \nDefendant contends that its rent-setting practices are committed to agency discretion and, \ntherefore not subject to judicial review, because the NHA does not provide meaningful standards \nagainst which the court can review HUD's detennination of what constitutes a \"market area.\"  (See \nDef. Br. at 19). Plaintiff counters that the \"law to apply\" can be found in the text of the statute itself, \nHUD's own regulations, the legislative history, and other agency materials. (See Plf. Resp. Sr. at 13-\nIS). \nInitially, the court observes that the NHA does not define the tenn \"market area.\"  Section \n1437f(0)( I )(8), which establishes a payment standard for the tenant-based housing choice voucher \nprogram, merely provides: \n[T]he payment standard for each size of dwelling unit in a market \narea shall not exceed 110 percent of the fair market rental established \nunder subsection (c) of this section for the same size of dwelling unit \nin the same market area and shall be not less than 90 percent of that \nfair market rental. \n42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o)(I)(B) (emphasis added). Section 1437f(c)(I), which deals generally with the \namount and scope of assistance payments, provides: \nThe maximum monthly rent shall not exceed by more than  to per \ncentum the fair market rental established by the Secretary periodically \nbut not less than annually for existing or newly constructed rental \n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 22      Filed 07/20/2009     Page 12 of 16\ndwelling units of various sizes and types in the market area suitable \nfor occupancy by persons assisted under this section[.] \nId. § I 437f(c)( I) (emphasis added). Although these statutory provisions use the tenn \"market area,\" \nneither sets forth any guidelines for determining how a \"market area\" should be established. \nAn agency's own regulations can also provide the requisite \"law to apply.\" See Ellison, 153 \nF.3d at 251.  The HUD regulation cited by plaintiff explains that \"FMRs are housing market-wide \nestimates of rents that  provide opportunities to  rent  standard quality  housing  throughout  the \ngeographic area in which rental housing units are in competition.\"  See 24 C.F.R. § 888.113(a) \n(emphasis added).  However, this regulation does not provide any guidance for determining what \nconstitutes a \"geographic area.\"  Certainly it does not support plaintiff's argument that large multi-\ncounty regions should not be the starting point for determining FMRs.  If anything, a fair reading of \nthe entire regulation suggests just the opposite.  Section 888.113(d) states: \nFMR areas  are  metropolitan areas and  nonmetropolitan counties \n(nonmelropolitan parts of counties in the New England States). With \nseveral exceptions, the  most current Office  of Management and \nBudget  (OMB)  metropolitan  area  definitions  of Metropolitan \nStatistical Areas (MSAs) and Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas \n(PMSAs) are used because of their generally close correspondence \nwith housing market area definitions.  HUn may make exceptions to \nOMB definitions if the MSAs or PMSAs encompass areas that are \nlarger than housing market areas.  The counties deleted from the \nHUD-defined FMR areas in those cases are established as separate \nmetropolitan county FMR areas. \nId. § 888. J l3(d) (emphasis added).  Still, nothing in the HUD regulation sets forth any identifiable \nfactors by which a court could review the agency's determination of what constitutes a specific \nhousing market area. \nNor is any of the legislative history cited by plaintiff useful in establishing meaningful \nstandards for judicial review of the agency's action.  Senate Report No. 93-693. which anticipated \n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 22      Filed 07/20/2009     Page 13 of 16\nthat HUD would \"define the 'areas' for which fair market rents are to he determined in such a way \nas not to include in a single area communities which are characterized by significant differences in \nrentals or construction costs for comparable housing,\" see Sen. Rep. No. 93-693,1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. \n4273,4315 (1974), is not part of the legislative history of the bill that was ultimately passed by \nCongress. Instead, Congress passed the House version ofthe bill, which required HUD \"to establish \nfair market rentals in each housing market area for new and existing units of various sizes and types \nsuitable for occupancy for low-income families,\" but did not further define \"market area.\"  See \nH. Conf. Rep. No. 93-1279, 1974 V.S.C.C.A.N. 4449, 4465 (1974).  Plaintiff also relies on a report \nprepared for HUD by an outside consulting finn, which recognizes that: \nAn  important  issue  [in  determining  the  demand  and  supply  of \naffordable rental housing] is what constitutes a rental housing market, \nthat is, within what group of properties are price adjustments made. \nClearly, there is no single national rental housing market.  Entire \nmetropolitan  areas  (particularly  the  larger  ones)  also  do  not \nconstitute single housing markets. \n(See Plf. Resp. App. at 26) (emphasis added).  However, this report relates to the Rural Housing \nService (\"RHS\") Section 515  program,  which  provides  direct  loans for  the construction and \nmaintenance of multi-family rental projects that serve low-income families, not the Section 8 \nvoucher program.  (See id. at 25). \nIn sum, the court concludes that there are no meaningful standards against which to review \nHUD's detennination  of what constitutes a  \"market area\"  under section  1437f of the NHA. \nConsequently, sovereign immunity bars any claims predicated on alleged violations of that statute. \n2. \nThe court reaches a different conclusion with respect to  alleged violations of section \n3608(e)(5) of the FHA, which imposes an affinnative duty on HUD to \"administer the [housing] \n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 22      Filed 07/20/2009     Page 14 of 16\nprograms ... in a manner affirmatively to further the policies of[the Act).\" 42 U.S.C. §3608(e)(5). \nNumerous courts have exercised subject matter jurisdiction over claims brought against HUD under \nsection 3608. See, e.g. N.A.A.C.P. v. Secretary o/Housing and Urban Development, 817 F.2d 149, \n160-61 (I st Cir. 1987); Darst-Webbe Tenant Assoc. Boardv. St. Louis Housing Authority.  417 FJd \n898,907 (8th Cir. 2005); see also Anderson v. Jackson, No. 06-3298, 2007 WL 458232 at *2 (E.D. \nLa. Feb. 6, 2007) (citing cases).  In its complaint, plaintiff alleges that HUD violated its duty to \nfurther the fair housing policies of the FHA by failing to consider the effects of its rent-setting \npractices on the racial composition of the areas affected and the integrated housing choices available \nto minority Section 8 participants in and around Dallas.  (See Plf. Compl. at t I,  37).  This claim \nis similar to other claims brought against HUD that were held to be reviewable under the APA  . See, \nu.s. \ne.g. Thompson v.  Dept. ojH  ousing and Urban Development, 348 F.Supp.2d 398, 464 (D. Md. \n2005) (suit alleging that HUD failed to fulfill its statutory duty under the FHA to consider the \nregional effects of its desegregation policies in regard to city's public housing); M&T Mortgage \nCorp. v. White. No. 04-CV-4775-NGGVVP, 2006 WL 47467 at *10 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 9, 2006) (suit \nalleging that HUD's actions in approving mortgage insurance applications without considering the \nracial impact of the program violated the FHA).4 \nB. \nFinally, defendant argues that plaintiff cannot seek judicial review under the APA because \nit has other adequate remedies at law.  See 5 U.S.C. § 704 (authorizing judicial review of final \n~  The court rejects defendant's argument that the Supreme Court's decision in Norton v. Southern Utah \nWilderness Alliance, 542 U.S. 55, 124 S.Ct. 2373, 159 L.Ed.2d 137 (2004) (\"SUWA\"), precludes judicial review of \nplaiOlitrs claims for alleged violations of the FHA.  In SUWA, the Supreme Court held that \"a claim under § 706(1) [of \nthe APA) can proceed only where a plaintiff asserts that an agency failed to take a discrete agency action that it is \nrequired to talce.\"  SUWA, 124 S.Ct. at 2379 (emphasis in original).  However, that requirement does not apply in \nsituations where, as here, a court is asked to review whether HUD has met its statutory duty to affinnatively further rair \nhousing policies. See Darst~Webbe, 417 F.3d at 907; Thompson v. U.S. Dept. a/Housing and Urban Development, No. \nMJG·95·309, 2006 WL 581260 at ·4·5 (D. Md. Jan. 10,2006). \n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 22      Filed 07/20/2009     Page 15 of 16\nagency actions \"for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court\").  The two alternative \nremedies suggested by defendant are:  (1) a suit for money damages in the Court of Federal Claims \nunder the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1491 (a)(I); or (2) an action against the Dallas Housing Authority \n(\"DHA\").  (See Def. Mot. Br. at 20-22).  However, plaintiff does not seek money damages in this \ncase,  It requests only injunctive relief,  Defendant wholly fails to explain how a suit for money \ndamages would be an adequate substitute for the relief sought by plaintitT--an injunction requiring \nHUD to consider the effects of its rent-setting practices on the racial composition ofthe Dallas rental \nhousing market and to affirmatively further fair housing opportunities for African-American Section \n8 participants in the Dallas area. Nor does defendant explain how a suit against DHA would change \nHUD's rent-setting practices.  Because no other adequate remedy is available, plaintiff may seek \ninjunctive relief against HUD under the APA for alleged violations of the FHA. \nRECOMMENDAn  ON \nDefendant's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction [Doc. #8] should be \ngranted in part and denied in part.  The motion should be granted on the ground of sovereign \nimmunity with respect to plaintiffs claims for alleged violations of the NHA.  In all other respects, \nthe motion should be denied. \nA copy of this report and recommendation shall  be served on all  parties in the manner \nprovided by law.  Any party may file written objections to the recommendation within 10 days after \nbeing served with a copy.  See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(I); FED. R. Cty. P. 72(b).

Forthe reasons stated herein, the motion should be granted in part and denied \nin part. \nI. \nPlaintiff The Inclusive Communities Project, Inc. (\"ICP\") is a non-profit organization that \nprovides assistance to minority families participating in the Housing Choice Voucher Program under \nSection 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (\"NHA\"l, as amended, 42 U.S.c. § 1437, el seq. \n(See Plf. CompI. at I, '112 & 9, 'II 32). The mission of the organization is to \"break down barriers to \nthe creation of racially and economically inclusive communities,\"  (ld. at I,  2).  To further this \ngoal, plaintiff provides mobility and financial assistance to low-income African-American families \nwho want to obtain rental housing in predominantly Caucasian areas in and around Dallas.  (Jd.  at \n9-10, '1133). The mobility assistance includes negotiating with landlords to obtain Section 8 housing \n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 22      Filed 07/20/2009     Page 2 of 16\nin eligible areas at affordable rents. (Id). The financial assistance provided by plaintitfto its clients \nincludes the payment of application fees, security deposits, and utility deposits.  (Id). \nUnder the Section 8 voucher program, HUn contracts with local public housing agencies and \nprivate landlords to pay the difference between a fair market rent for the area and the amount paid \nby  the  low-income tenant.l  See  generally,  42  U.s.C.  §  I 437f(0).  HUD  is  responsible  for \nestablishing fair market rents, or FMRs, for the rental housing market area.  See id.  § 1437f(c)(I). \nThe HUn regulations explain how these FMRs are calculated: \nFair Market Rents (FMRs) are estimates of rent plus the cost of \nutilities, except telephone. FMRs are housing market-wide estimates \nof rents that provide opportunities to rent standard quality housing \nthroughout the geographic area in which rental housing units are in \ncompetition.  The level at which FMRs are set is expressed as a \npercentile point within the rent distribution of standard quality rental \nhousing units in the FMR area. FMRs are set at the 40th or 50th \npercentile rent--the dollar amount below which the rent for 40 or 50 \npercent of standard quality rental housing units falls.  The 40th or \n50th percentile rent is drawn from the distribution of rents of all units \nthat are occupied by recent movers. Adjustments are made to exclude \npublic housing units, newly built units and substandard units. \n24 C.F.R. § 888.113(a).  The regulations emphasize that HUn \"uses the most accurate and current \ndata available to develop the FMR estimates,\" including census data and random digit dialing \ntelephone surveys.  See id. § 888.II3(e)(I).  Using this method, HUD annually estimates FMRs for \napproximately 350 metropolitan areas and 2,300 non-metropolitan counties throughout the United \nStates.  See generally. Franconia Assoc. v.  United Slales, 61  Fed. CI. 718, 760 (2004).  The issue \nin this case involves the geographic area used by HUD to detennine FMRs in the Dallas rental \nhousing market. \nA tenant family may be required to pay up to 40% of its monthly adjusted income for rent.  See 42 U.S.C. \nI \n§ 1437~oX2XAX;) & (oX3). \n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 22      Filed 07/20/2009     Page 3 of 16\nThe Dallas, TX HUD Metro FMR area is comprised of eight counties, which are carved out \nof a larger Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington metropolitan statistical area defined by the Office of \nManagement and Budget (\"OMB\"). (See Plf. Compl. at 3-4, ~~ 9 & 13). According to plaintiff, this \npractice of using a large multi-county region as the starting point for detennining FMR violates both \nthe NHA, which requires HUD to base FMRs on \"market area,\" and the Fair Housing Act of 1968 \n(\"FHA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 3601, et seq., which imposes an affinnative duty on HUD to promote fair \nhousing policies.  (See id. at II, ~ 37).  Succinctly stated, plaintitfcontends that HUD's practice \nincorporates rents from predominately minority housing markets, where many ofthe neighborhoods \nare blighted and have inadequate public and private services and facilities, and results in lower FMRs \nfor the Dallas rental housing market area, thereby precluding Section 8 program participants from \nobtaining rental housing in more amuent Caucasian areas.  (See id. at 3, ,  10).  Instead, plaintiff \nargues that HUD should use smaller geographic areas to determine FMRs, which would more \naccurately reflect the rent levels in Caucasian neighborhoods and give low-income minority families \nequal access to rental housing in those neighborhoods. (See id. at 6-7,  19).  In this lawsuit, plaintiff \nseeks broad equitable relief, including an injunction: (1) compelling HUD to use smaller rental \nhousing market areas, instead of large multi-county regions, as a basis for delennining FMRs; (2) \nrequiring HUD to establish separate Section 8 program rent levels for separate rental housing \nmarkets; and (3) compelling HUD to \"consider and further fair housing opportunities\" for minority \nparticipants in the Section 8 program when it sets rent levels.  (See id. at 11-12,  39). \nThe case is before the court on defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter \njurisdiction. As grounds for its motion, defendant contends that plaintiff lacks standing to bring this \nsuit and that HUD has not waived sovereign immunity.  The issues have been fully briefed by the \npanies and the motion is ripe for detennination. \n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 22      Filed 07/20/2009     Page 4 of 16\nII. \nThe gravamen of defendant's standing argument is that the remedies sought by plaintifTwill \nnot redress its injuries and amount to nothing more than generalized grievances.2  Because standing \nis a prerequisite to the exercise of federal jurisdiction, the court considers this issue first.  See Cole \nv.  General Motors Corp., 484 F.3d 717, 721  (5th Cir. 2007). \nA. \n\"The doctrine of standing addresses the question of who may properly bring suit in federal \ncourt.\"  The inclusive Communities Project, Inc.  v.  Texas Dept. 0/ Housing & Comm. Affairs, No. \n3-08-CV-0549-D, 2008 WL 5191935 at +2 (N.D. Tex. Dec. 11,2008).  To satisfy the case-or-\ncontroversy requirement of Article HI of the Constitution, the plaintiff must establish that it has \n\"suffered 'injury in fact,' that the injury is 'fairly traceable' to the actions of the defendant, and that \nthe injury will likely he redressed by a favorable decision.\"  Id., 2008 WL 5191935 at +2, quoting \nBennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 162, 117 S.Ct. 1154, 1161, 137 L.Ed.2d 281 (1997).  An injury in \nfact must be \"concrete and ... actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\"  Id, quoting \nLujan v.  Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61,112 S.Ct. 2130,2136,119 L.Ed.2d 351 \n(1992).  Moreover, \"the injury must affect the plaintiff in a personal and individual way,\"  Id. \nquoting Lujan, 112 S.Ct. at 2136 n.1. Stated differently. a party must assert its own legal rights and \ninterests, and cannot rest its claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties. See Warth \nv.  Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 500, 95 S.Ct. 2197,2206,45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975).  For injunctions, the \nplaintiff must also show that it is likely to suffer future injury as a result of the challenged conduct, \n1  Defendant also argues that plaintiff lacks standing to sue on behalf of its clients. that plaintiff cannot obtain \ninjunctive relief for past injuries, and that any claims based on FMRs, other than the FMRs currently in effect, are moot. \n(See Der. Mot. Br. at 10-12, 15).  In its response, plaintiff makes clear that it seeks relief only for its own injuries and \nonly with respect to HUD's current practice of determining FMRs. (See Plf. Resp. 8r. at 20-21). The court therefore \ndeclines to address these other grounds for dismissal.  However, in order to clarity its claims and the nature of relief \nsought, plaintiff should amend its complaint before this case proceeds further. \n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 22      Filed 07/20/2009     Page 5 of 16\nand that the reliefrequested will prevent that future injury.  See James v.  City of Dallas, 254 F.3d \n551,563 (5th CiT. 2001), cerl. denied, 122 S.Ct. 919 (2002), citing CityoJLos Angelesv. Lyons, 461 \nU.S. 95, 102, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 1665,75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983).  However, \"if the injury is accompanied \nby any continuing, present adverse effects, standing for injunctive relief can be found.\"  Id, quoting \nLyons, 103 S.Ct. at 1665 (internal quotations omitted). \nAs the party seeking to invoke federal jurisdiction, plaintiff bears the burden of proving its \nstanding.  See Inclusive Communities Project, 2008 WL 5191935 at \"'2, citing Lujan, 112 S.Ct. at \n2136.  A defendant may challenge standing by filing a Rule 12(b)(I) motion to dismiss.  If the \ndefendant merely brings a Rule 12(b)(I) motion, it is considered a facial attack, and the court looks \nonly to the sufficiency of the allegations in the pleading, assuming them to be true.  See Paterson v. \nWeinberger, 644 F.2d 521, 523 (5th CiT. 1981).  The court must deny the motion if the allegations \nare sufficient to allege jurisdiction.  See Inclusive Communities Project, 2008 WL 5191935 at .3. \nA defendant may also make a factual attack on subject matter jurisdiction by submitting evidence, \nsuch as affidavits and testimony.  See Middle South Energy, Inc.  v. City o/New Orleans, 800 F.2d \n488, 490 (5th Cir. 1986),  When a defendant provides evidence factually attacking subject matter \njurisdiction, the plaintiff must submit evidence and prove by a preponderance of the evidence that \nthe court has jurisdiction.  Id  In the instant case, HUD has submitted an affidavit in support of its \nRule 12(b)(I) motion.  However, nothing in the affidavit challenges any factual matters necessary \nto the detennination of standing. The court therefore treats the motion as a facial attack, rather than \na factual attack, on jurisdiction. See Estate o/Merkel v. United Siales, No. 3-06-CV -1891-D, 2008 \nWL 5378183 at '2 n.2 (N.D. Tex. Dec. 23,2008) (treating Rule 12(b)(1) motion as facial attack \nwhere affidavits submitted by defendant did not challenge any factual matter bearing on jurisdiction); \n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 22      Filed 07/20/2009     Page 6 of 16\nIBEW-NECA  Southwestern Health & Benefit Fund v.  WinsleI, No. 3-06-CV-0038-D, 2006 WL \n954010 at '1 (N.D. Tex. Apr. 12,2006) (same). \nB. \nDefendant contends that plaintiff lacks standing to challenge HUD's practice of determining \nFMRs for the Dallas rental housing market because the injunctive relief it seeks will not redress its \ninjuries.  Under the third requirement of Article 1II standing, plaintiff must show that it is '''likely,' \nas opposed to merely 'speculative; that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\" Lujan, \n112 S.Ct. at 2136.  Although defendant does not directly challenge plaintiffs alleged injuries at the \npleading stage, (see Def. Reply at 2), it is necessary to briefly discuss the nature of those injuries \nbefore examining redressability. \nI. \nA non-profit fair housing organization, such as plaintiff, can establish injury by showing that \nthe challenged unlawful conduct frustrates its mission and requires it to devote significant resources \nto counteracting the discriminatory effects of that conduct.  See Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman , \n455 U.S. 363, 379,102 S.Ct. 1114, 1124-25,71 L.Ed.2d 214 (1989).  Here, plaintiff alleges that \nHUO's practice of using a large multi-county region as the starting point for determining FMRs \nresults in racial segregation in the Dallas rental housing market, thereby frustrating plaintiffs mission \nof promoting equal housing opportunities and requiring the expenditure of more time and more \nmoney to achieve its goals.  (See Plf. Compl. at 7, ~ 26 &  10, 'i\\35).  In particular, plaintiff alleges \nthat HUD's rent setting policy directly and adversely affects its interests by: \n•  reducing the number of units that plaintiff can use to help its \nclients  find  housing in  non-minority concentrated market \nareas; \n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 22      Filed 07/20/2009     Page 7 of 16\n•  increasing the amount of time per client that plaintiff must \nspend in order to help its clients find housing in non-minority \nconcentrated market areas; \n•  increasing the amount of financial assistance that plaintiff \nmust spend in order to help its clients find housing in 000-\nminority concentrated market areas; and \n•  discouraging families who work with plaintiff from choosing \ndwelling units in market areas that offer racially integrated \nhousing because of the cost factors involved in such a choice. \n(See  Plf.  CampI.  at  10, ~ 35).  Similar allegations  of hann  suffered  by non-profit  housing \norganizations have been held sufficient to establish injury for standing purposes.  See, e.g. Havens \nRealty, 102 S.Ct. at 1123-25; Inclusive Communities Project, 2008 WL 5191935 at '4. \n2. \nThe issue raised by defendant is whether the remedy requested by plaintifTis likely to redress \nits injuries. The court has little difficulty concluding that an injunction requiring HUn to use smaller \nrental housing market areas, instead of a large multi.county region, as a basis for determining FMRs \nwould result in higher rental rates in predominantly Caucasian areas of Dallas, thereby expanding \nopportunities for low·income African American families to obtain Section 8 housing in those areas. \nWith more rental housing opportunities available in non·minority areas, plaintiff likely will have to \nspend less time and less money helping clients secure housing in desegregated neighborhoods.  At \nleast at the pleading stage. plaintiff has sufficiently demonstrated that it is likely, as opposed to \nmerely speculative, that its injuries will be redressed by a favorable decision in this case.  See \nInclusive Communities Project, 2008 WL 5191935 at .6.3 \n) This conclusion is bolstered if the court treats defendant's Rule 12(bX I) motion as a factual anack, rather than \na facial attack, on jurisdiction.  In an anempt to counter defendant's argument that the relief requested in this lawsuit \nwould not necessarily expand housing opportunities in predominantly Caucasian areas, plaintiff relies on the affidavit \nof its Mobility Assistance Director, Stephanie McGee, who states: \n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 22      Filed 07/20/2009     Page 8 of 16\nC. \nDefendant further contends that plaintiffs request for a broad injunction eliminating racial \ndisparities in the Dallas rental housing market area is nothing more than a \"generalized grievance.\" \nAt issue is plaintiffs request for: \nan injunction compelling HUD to set separate Section 8 program rent \nlevels for the separate rental housing markets at dollar amounts that \nprovide DHA's Black Section 8 voucher program participants equal \naccess to rental housing in the White rental housing markets.  Equal \naccess is achieved by setting rent levels using the 50th percentile \nbasis for each of the rental housing markets and eliminating the \ndisparities between the nwnber and percent of dwelling units made \navailable in  predominately White rental housing markets and the \nnumber  and  percent  of  dwelling  units  made  available  in \npredominantly minority rental housing markets. \n(See Def. Mot. Br. at 10 & Def. Reply at 2, citing Plf. Compl. at 12, ~ 39D).  Relying on the Fifth \nCircuit's decision in James v. City ofD  allas, 254 F.3d 551 (5th Cir. 200 I), defendant argues that the \ninjunction sought by plaintiff is too general to support Article III standing. \nDuring the period from May 2007 through September 2007 ICP negotiated with 44 \nlandlords in predominantly white areas on behalf of African American Section 8 \nvoucher participants concerning the issues raised by the rent being higher than the \nSection 8 rent as set by HUD Fair Market Rent level. In 20 instances, the landlord \nrefused to lower the rem even though the tenant was eligible !O rent the unit.  In \nthese cases, but for the fact that rents set by the HUD Fair Market Rent levels were \nlower than the rent charged by the landlord, the Seclion 8 participant would have \nrented that specific unit in a predominately while area. \nDuring that same period ICP was able to negotiate with 24 landlords who agreed \nto lower the contract rent for the dwelling unit in order for an African American \nSection 8 participant to rent the unit. In these cases, ICP was only able to obtain the \nrent reduction by paying the landlord a bonus. The bonus was high enough in these \ninstances for the landlord to forego its usual rent and lower the rent charged to the \nSection 8 participam.  ICP has spent 523,686.50 for these bonus payments during \nthis period. \n(See Plf. Resp. App. at 3).  This evidence, ifconsidered by the court, supports the conclusion that the injury alleged by \nplaintiIT-·the increased time and costs associated with helping minority families obtain rental housing in non-minority \nareas--likely would be redressed by an injunction requiring HUOto use smaller rental housing market areas as the basis \nfor detennining FMRs. \n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 22      Filed 07/20/2009     Page 9 of 16\nJames was a class action brought by two African-American homeowners against the City of \nDallas and HUD challenging the demolition of repairable single-family homes in predominately \nminority neighborhoods without proper notice or a warrant, and charging that the \"no-notice\" \ndemolition program was the result of intentional race discrimination. James, 254 F Jd at 558.  In \ntheir complaint, the  plaintiffs  sought,  inter alia,  \"a  pennanent  injunction  requiring  HUD  to \nadminister all  of its  housing programs in  a manner that  will  eradicate  the  effects of HUD's \ndiscriminatory demolition practices[.]\" Jd. at 561. The Fifth Circuit held that this broad request for \ninjunctive relief was not sufficiently targeted to remedy plaintiffs' specific injuries.  ld.  at 568. \nTherefore, the plaintiffs lacked standing to seek such relief.  ld., citing Warth, 95 S.Ct. at 2205 \n(recognizing that a \"generalized grievance\" shared in substantially equal measure by all or most \ncitizens cannot provide standing to request injunctive relief). \nUnlike the injunction requested in James, the relief sought by plaintiff in the instant case is \nnot a \"sweeping request to generally eradicate the effects of discrimination.\" Cf id.  Instead, plaintiff \nasks the court to require HUD to \"set separate Section 8 program rent levels for the separate rental \nhousing markets at dollar amounts that provide DHA's Black Section 8 voucher program participants \nequal access to rental housing in the White rental housing markets.\" (See Plf. Compl. at  12, ~ 390). \nPlaintiff goes on to suggest that \"(e]qual access is achieved by setting rent levels using the 50th \npercentile basis for each of the rental housing markets and eliminating the disparities between the \nnumber and percent of dwelling units made available in predominately White rental housing markets \nand the number and percent of dwelling units made available in predominantly minority rental \nhousing markets.\" (Id.).  Read in its entirety, it is clear that plaintiff does not seek a broad injunction \nto \"eliminat[e] racial disparities in housing opportunities,\" 8S defendant argues in its motion.  (See \nDef. Mot. Br. at  10).  By enjoining HUD from using a large multi-county region as a basis for \n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 22      Filed 07/20/2009     Page 10 of 16\ndetermining FMRs and requiring the agency to set separate fent levels for separate rental housing \nmarkets defined by smaller geographic areas, plaintiffis attempting to further its mission of helping \nlow-income minority families gain access to the rental housing market in predominantly Caucasian \nareas ofDaJlas,  Such relief is targeted to remedy plaintiffs specific injury of having to spend more \ntime and more money to accomplish its goals, and does not seek to redress a \"generalized grievance.\" \nThus, plaintifThas demonstrated Article III standing to prosecute this claim for injunctive relief. \nIll. \nThe court next considers whether plaintiff's claims under the APA, through which it seeks \nredress for alleged violations of the NHA and the FHA, are barred by the doctrine of sovereign \nimmunity.  While recognizing that the APA allows a person to seek judicial review for an alleged \nlegal wrong committed by a federal agency, see 5 U.S.C. § 702, defendant argues that this statutory \nwaiver of sovereign immunity does not apply to plaintiff's claims because:  (I) HUD's rent-setting \npractices are committed to agency discretion by law; and (2) plaintiff has other adequate remedies. \nA. \n\"The basic rule of federal sovereign immunity is that the United States cannot be sued at all \nwithout the consent of Congress. \" St. Tammany Parish v. Federal Emergency Management Agency, \n556 F.3d 307, 316 (5th Cir. 2009), quoting Block v.  North Dakota ex rei. Board a! University & \nSchoolLands, 461 U.S. 273, 287, 103 S.Ct. 1811, 1819,75 L.Ed.2d 840 (1983).  Section 702 of the \nAPA authorizes suits against the United States through a limited waiver of sovereign immunity for \nrelief other than monetary damages related to an agency's regulatory action.  Id.  at 317, citing 5 \nU.S.C. § 702.  However. the waiver does not apply to agency actions that are committed to agency \ndiscretion by law.  /d, ciling 5 U.S.C. § 70 I (a)(2).  This exception to judicial review is \"very \nnarrow\" and applies only \"in those rare instances where 'statutes are drawn in such broad tenns that \n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 22      Filed 07/20/2009     Page 11 of 16\nin a given case there is no law to apply.'\"  Ellison v.  Connor IS3 F.3d 247, 2S1  (Sth Cir. 1998), \nquoting Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 410, 91 S.Ct. 814, 821, 28 \nL.Ed.2d 136 (1971); see also Sun/ex Dairy v. Block, 666 F.2d IS8, 163 (Sth Cir.), cert. denied, 103 \nS.Ct. 59 (1982).  Stated differently, judicial review is unavailable only \"if the statute is drawn so that \na court  would have no  meaningful  standard  against  which to judge the  agency's  exercise  of \ndiscretion.\"  Heckler v. Chaney. 470 U.S. 821, 830, lOS S.Ct. 1649, 16SS, 84 L.Ed.2d 714 (198S). \nI. \nDefendant contends that its rent-setting practices are committed to agency discretion and, \ntherefore not subject to judicial review, because the NHA does not provide meaningful standards \nagainst which the court can review HUD's detennination of what constitutes a \"market area.\"  (See \nDef. Br. at 19). Plaintiff counters that the \"law to apply\" can be found in the text of the statute itself, \nHUD's own regulations, the legislative history, and other agency materials. (See Plf. Resp. Sr. at 13-\nIS). \nInitially, the court observes that the NHA does not define the tenn \"market area.\"  Section \n1437f(0)( I )(8), which establishes a payment standard for the tenant-based housing choice voucher \nprogram, merely provides: \n[T]he payment standard for each size of dwelling unit in a market \narea shall not exceed 110 percent of the fair market rental established \nunder subsection (c) of this section for the same size of dwelling unit \nin the same market area and shall be not less than 90 percent of that \nfair market rental. \n42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o)(I)(B) (emphasis added). Section 1437f(c)(I), which deals generally with the \namount and scope of assistance payments, provides: \nThe maximum monthly rent shall not exceed by more than  to per \ncentum the fair market rental established by the Secretary periodically \nbut not less than annually for existing or newly constructed rental \n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 22      Filed 07/20/2009     Page 12 of 16\ndwelling units of various sizes and types in the market area suitable \nfor occupancy by persons assisted under this section[.] \nId. § I 437f(c)( I) (emphasis added). Although these statutory provisions use the tenn \"market area,\" \nneither sets forth any guidelines for determining how a \"market area\" should be established. \nAn agency's own regulations can also provide the requisite \"law to apply.\" See Ellison, 153 \nF.3d at 251.  The HUD regulation cited by plaintiff explains that \"FMRs are housing market-wide \nestimates of rents that  provide opportunities to  rent  standard quality  housing  throughout  the \ngeographic area in which rental housing units are in competition.\"  See 24 C.F.R. § 888.113(a) \n(emphasis added).  However, this regulation does not provide any guidance for determining what \nconstitutes a \"geographic area.\"  Certainly it does not support plaintiff's argument that large multi-\ncounty regions should not be the starting point for determining FMRs.  If anything, a fair reading of \nthe entire regulation suggests just the opposite.  Section 888.113(d) states: \nFMR areas  are  metropolitan areas and  nonmetropolitan counties \n(nonmelropolitan parts of counties in the New England States). With \nseveral exceptions, the  most current Office  of Management and \nBudget  (OMB)  metropolitan  area  definitions  of Metropolitan \nStatistical Areas (MSAs) and Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas \n(PMSAs) are used because of their generally close correspondence \nwith housing market area definitions.  HUn may make exceptions to \nOMB definitions if the MSAs or PMSAs encompass areas that are \nlarger than housing market areas.  The counties deleted from the \nHUD-defined FMR areas in those cases are established as separate \nmetropolitan county FMR areas. \nId. § 888. J l3(d) (emphasis added).  Still, nothing in the HUD regulation sets forth any identifiable \nfactors by which a court could review the agency's determination of what constitutes a specific \nhousing market area. \nNor is any of the legislative history cited by plaintiff useful in establishing meaningful \nstandards for judicial review of the agency's action.  Senate Report No. 93-693. which anticipated \n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 22      Filed 07/20/2009     Page 13 of 16\nthat HUD would \"define the 'areas' for which fair market rents are to he determined in such a way \nas not to include in a single area communities which are characterized by significant differences in \nrentals or construction costs for comparable housing,\" see Sen. Rep. No. 93-693,1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. \n4273,4315 (1974), is not part of the legislative history of the bill that was ultimately passed by \nCongress. Instead, Congress passed the House version ofthe bill, which required HUD \"to establish \nfair market rentals in each housing market area for new and existing units of various sizes and types \nsuitable for occupancy for low-income families,\" but did not further define \"market area.\"  See \nH. Conf. Rep. No. 93-1279, 1974 V.S.C.C.A.N. 4449, 4465 (1974).  Plaintiff also relies on a report \nprepared for HUD by an outside consulting finn, which recognizes that: \nAn  important  issue  [in  determining  the  demand  and  supply  of \naffordable rental housing] is what constitutes a rental housing market, \nthat is, within what group of properties are price adjustments made. \nClearly, there is no single national rental housing market.  Entire \nmetropolitan  areas  (particularly  the  larger  ones)  also  do  not \nconstitute single housing markets. \n(See Plf. Resp. App. at 26) (emphasis added).  However, this report relates to the Rural Housing \nService (\"RHS\") Section 515  program,  which  provides  direct  loans for  the construction and \nmaintenance of multi-family rental projects that serve low-income families, not the Section 8 \nvoucher program.  (See id. at 25). \nIn sum, the court concludes that there are no meaningful standards against which to review \nHUD's detennination  of what constitutes a  \"market area\"  under section  1437f of the NHA. \nConsequently, sovereign immunity bars any claims predicated on alleged violations of that statute. \n2. \nThe court reaches a different conclusion with respect to  alleged violations of section \n3608(e)(5) of the FHA, which imposes an affinnative duty on HUD to \"administer the [housing] \n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 22      Filed 07/20/2009     Page 14 of 16\nprograms ... in a manner affirmatively to further the policies of[the Act).\" 42 U.S.C. §3608(e)(5). \nNumerous courts have exercised subject matter jurisdiction over claims brought against HUD under \nsection 3608. See, e.g. N.A.A.C.P. v. Secretary o/Housing and Urban Development, 817 F.2d 149, \n160-61 (I st Cir. 1987); Darst-Webbe Tenant Assoc. Boardv. St. Louis Housing Authority.  417 FJd \n898,907 (8th Cir. 2005); see also Anderson v. Jackson, No. 06-3298, 2007 WL 458232 at *2 (E.D. \nLa. Feb. 6, 2007) (citing cases).  In its complaint, plaintiff alleges that HUD violated its duty to \nfurther the fair housing policies of the FHA by failing to consider the effects of its rent-setting \npractices on the racial composition of the areas affected and the integrated housing choices available \nto minority Section 8 participants in and around Dallas.  (See Plf. Compl. at t I,  37).  This claim \nis similar to other claims brought against HUD that were held to be reviewable under the APA  . See, \nu.s. \ne.g. Thompson v.  Dept. ojH  ousing and Urban Development, 348 F.Supp.2d 398, 464 (D. Md. \n2005) (suit alleging that HUD failed to fulfill its statutory duty under the FHA to consider the \nregional effects of its desegregation policies in regard to city's public housing); M&T Mortgage \nCorp. v. White. No. 04-CV-4775-NGGVVP, 2006 WL 47467 at *10 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 9, 2006) (suit \nalleging that HUD's actions in approving mortgage insurance applications without considering the \nracial impact of the program violated the FHA).4 \nB. \nFinally, defendant argues that plaintiff cannot seek judicial review under the APA because \nit has other adequate remedies at law.  See 5 U.S.C. § 704 (authorizing judicial review of final \n~  The court rejects defendant's argument that the Supreme Court's decision in Norton v. Southern Utah \nWilderness Alliance, 542 U.S. 55, 124 S.Ct. 2373, 159 L.Ed.2d 137 (2004) (\"SUWA\"), precludes judicial review of \nplaiOlitrs claims for alleged violations of the FHA.  In SUWA, the Supreme Court held that \"a claim under § 706(1) [of \nthe APA) can proceed only where a plaintiff asserts that an agency failed to take a discrete agency action that it is \nrequired to talce.\"  SUWA, 124 S.Ct. at 2379 (emphasis in original).  However, that requirement does not apply in \nsituations where, as here, a court is asked to review whether HUD has met its statutory duty to affinnatively further rair \nhousing policies. See Darst~Webbe, 417 F.3d at 907; Thompson v. U.S. Dept. a/Housing and Urban Development, No. \nMJG·95·309, 2006 WL 581260 at ·4·5 (D. Md. Jan. 10,2006). \n\nCase 3:07-cv-00945-O-BD     Document 22      Filed 07/20/2009     Page 15 of 16\nagency actions \"for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court\").  The two alternative \nremedies suggested by defendant are:  (1) a suit for money damages in the Court of Federal Claims \nunder the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1491 (a)(I); or (2) an action against the Dallas Housing Authority \n(\"DHA\").  (See Def. Mot. Br. at 20-22).  However, plaintiff does not seek money damages in this \ncase,  It requests only injunctive relief,  Defendant wholly fails to explain how a suit for money \ndamages would be an adequate substitute for the relief sought by plaintitT--an injunction requiring \nHUD to consider the effects of its rent-setting practices on the racial composition ofthe Dallas rental \nhousing market and to affirmatively further fair housing opportunities for African-American Section \n8 participants in the Dallas area. Nor does defendant explain how a suit against DHA would change \nHUD's rent-setting practices.  Because no other adequate remedy is available, plaintiff may seek \ninjunctive relief against HUD under the APA for alleged violations of the FHA. \nRECOMMENDAn  ON \nDefendant's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction [Doc. #8] should be \ngranted in part and denied in part.  The motion should be granted on the ground of sovereign \nimmunity with respect to plaintiffs claims for alleged violations of the NHA.  In all other respects, \nthe motion should be denied. \nA copy of this report and recommendation shall  be served on all  parties in the manner \nprovided by law.  Any party may file written objections to the recommendation within 10 days after \nbeing served with a copy.  See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(I); FED. R. Cty. P. 72(b).  The failure to file \nwritten objections will  bar the aggrieved party from  appealing the factual  findings  and  legal \nconclusions of the magistrate judge that are accepted or adopted by the district court, except upon \ngrounds of plain error.
