    "summary": "<p>On October 1, 1999 several disabled plaintiffs brought a national class action in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado against Kmart for violating the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act. The case was heard by Judge John L. Kane.</p>\r\n<p>Specifically, Plaintiffs alleged Kmart provided \"insufficient parking for persons with disabilities, has counters that are too high for persons who use wheelchairs, fails to provide accessible check-out aisles to persons who use wheelchairs, fails to provide accessible fitting rooms and blocks access to merchandise aisles for persons who use wheelchairs,\" all in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 12182 et seq. (ADA) and the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act, C.R.S. &sect; 24-34-601 et seq. (CADA).</p>\r\n<p>A Second Amended Complaint, filed on March 22, 2006, added additional individuals to represent a sub-class of persons similarly situated who resided in states with statutory damages statutes, adding claims for damages under these state laws, the California Unruh Civil Rights Act and the California Disabled Persons Act, Cal. Civ. Code &sect;&sect; 51(b) &amp; 54.1, Hawaii's Chapter 489, Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 489 et seq., the Texas Human Resource Code, Tex Hum. Res. Code Ann. &sect; 121.001 et seq., the Massachusetts Anti-discrimination law, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect;&sect; 98 and 92A, the New York Civil Rights Law, N.Y. Civ. Rights &sect; 40 et seq., and N.Y. Exec &sect; 296(2)(a), and the Oregon Unlawful Discrimination against Disabled People, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 659A.142(3).</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs requested declaratory and injunctive relief ordering Kmart to bring its stores into compliance with the ADA. They also requested statutory damages under the state statutes and attorneys' fees and costs.</p>\r\n<p>In January 2002, Kmart sought bankruptcy protection in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Chief Judge Susan Pierson Sonderby. Although this action temporarily halted the plaintiffs' case, the District of Colorado allowed the action to continue after Kmart emerged from bankruptcy in May 2003.</p>\r\n<p>On July 13, 2005, the court certified a settlement class consisting of \"[a]ll persons who, at any time from May 6, 2003 through the Term of this Agreement, used, use or will use wheelchairs or scooters for mobility and who shopped or shop at any Kmart Store or any Closed Kmart Store or who allege they would shop or would have shopped at one or more Kmart Stores or Closed Kmart Stores but for allegedly being denied on the basis of disability the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of such Kmart Store(s) or Closed Kmart Store(s).\" 2005 WL 1648182.</p>\r\n<p>On February 9, 2006, the parties reached a settlement that required Kmart to bring all its stores into compliance with Department of Justice standards for accessibility, increase aisle space, widen aisles, improve restrooms, and many other changes. Monitoring would be done by mystery shoppers, customer feedback, and comment forms. The settlement created a $13 million dollar damages pool ($5m in gift cards, $8m in cash) from which statutory damages would be deducted. Kmart was also obliged to pay $10,000 each to the original three plaintiffs and $1000 to the five additional plaintiffs who were added, as well as $3.25 million in attorney's fees and costs, and additional costs of administering the settlement. The court approved the settlement on March 22, 2006. 234 F.R.D. 688.</p>\r\n<p>On the same day, the Court certified a \"Damages Settlement Sub-Class\" consisting of the class members residing in states with damages statutes and who shopped or would have shopped but for lack of accommodations in Kmarts in California, Colorado, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon or Texas. The $13 million damages pool was to go to members of the sub class, who could recover for a maximum of two visits to Kmart, for amounts under state law. 2006 WL 722163. Later that year, on July 27, the court granted the plaintiffs' unopposed motion for attorney's fees, awarding additional fees up to $248,312.56 plus any future cost of implementing the agreement. 2006 WL 2729260.</p>\r\n<p>On June 29, 2009, the Court granted a joint motion to amend the settlement. The parties amended the agreement to permit Kmart to reduce the number of stores to be retrofitted during the period between May 8, 2009 and May 8, 2010 from 215 to 150.</p>\r\n<p>On July 25, 2011, the parties filed a motion to modify the settlement agreement, which was approved by Judge Kane on August 10, 2011. The modified settlement agreement stipulated that Kmart would remedy 130 stores from May 9, 2012-May 8, 2013, 130 stores from May 9, 2013-May 8, 2014, and 84 stores between May 9, 2014-May 8, 2015.</p>\r\n<p>As of December 31, 2023, there have been no docket entries in the case since 2014 and it is presumed closed.</p>",

Their motion was based on evidence of Kmart’s centralized policies and policy\nfailures and extensive testimony from disabled Kmart shoppers concerning the barriers they had\nencountered.  Defendant Kmart Corporation (“Kmart”) concedes that its store operating policies\n\nare centralized -- a concession that, in and of itself, makes class certification appropriate.  In\naddition, information produced by Kmart in response to this Court’s Order of September 20,\n2001, provides extensive evidence of barriers to Kmart customers who use wheelchairs,\nincluding: (1) reports from more than 19,000 visits by “mystery shoppers” to more than 2,000\nKmart stores documenting obstructions that would likely pose barriers to shoppers in\nwheelchairs; (2) Kmart’s own ADA compliance surveys showing widespread lack of\ncompliance, including, for example, the fact that 39% of the stores for which Kmart provided\ndata do not have sufficient accessible parking; and (3) surveys conducted for Kmart in July,\n2001, by experts it retained for the purpose of opposing class certification which show, for\nexample, that 35% of the time, the stores surveyed failed to maintain an accessible route through\nsidewalk merchandise displays, access to approximately 25% of the fitting rooms was\nobstructed, and 20% of customer service counters did not comply.  \nIn its Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification (“Class\nOpposition” or “Class Opp.”), Kmart attempts to defeat class certification by making three\nprincipal arguments:  (1) that a class should not be certified because there are no identical,\narchitectural barriers at issue; (2) that the experiences of putative class members cannot be\ncommon because each Kmart store is different and because many putative class members had\nexperienced both discriminatory and non-discriminatory treatment at Kmart stores; and (3) that\nthe experiences of putative class members were isolated and temporary.  Kmart also makes\n-2-\n\nextensive arguments on the merits to the effect that it is already in compliance with Title III of\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12181 et seq.1  \nMuch of Kmart’s Class Opposition and its supporting papers are dedicated to establishing\na factual proposition that Named Plaintiffs never contested and readily concede:  Kmart stores\nare physically different from one another.  This argument misses the point:  Commonality can\narise from physical similarity; it can also arise, as it does here, when a class challenges\ncentralized policies that result in common discriminatory experiences.  The physical differences\ntouted by Kmart do not reduce either the similarity of these experiences or the control Kmart\nexercises through its centralized policies over the physical conditions at those stores.  To the\nextent Kmart argues that class certification requires that all of its stores be identical or that all\nclass members always experience discrimination on every visit to every Kmart, it is arguing for a\nstandard far beyond that of Rule 23, one imposed on no other protected class.  \nA number of Kmart’s arguments are either made in its Statement of Facts or appear in\nseveral different sections of its Rule 23 analysis.  Because its primary argument appears to be a\nlack of commonality, Named Plaintiffs will address these broad themes first before addressing\nKmart’s specific objections to numerosity, typicality, representation, Rule 23(b)(2), standing and\nthe practicalities of trying this case as a class action.  Finally, while urging the Court to postpone\nanalysis of the merits of the case until after resolution of their motion to certify a class, Named\nPlaintiffs briefly address several merits questions raised by Kmart in its Class Opposition.  \n1 Unless otherwise noted, all statutory citations are to Title 42 of the United States\nCode. \n-3-\n\nARGUMENT\nI. Named Plaintiffs’ Challenges to Kmart’s Centralized Policies Present Common\nQuestions of Law and Fact Sufficient to Satisfy the Commonality Requirement.\nA. Cases Challenging Centralized Policies are Routinely Certified as Class\nActions.\nNamed Plaintiffs have demonstrated that Kmart’s store operations policies are highly\ncentralized.  (See Class Mem. at 14-25.)  In its Class Opposition and in oral argument before this\nCourt, Kmart agreed.  In its opposition brief, Kmart concedes that it has a single set of operating\npolices.  (See Class Opp. at 15; see also id. at 7 (describing centralized review and modification\nof design criteria).)  Kmart’s counsel also stated before this Court, in opposing Named Plaintiffs’\nmotion to compel:  \nPlaintiffs have spoken to centralized policies as an issue going to certification. \nThat’s true, and obviously any company like a Kmart that has over 2100 stores\nacross the country has centralized policies, centralized training, all sorts of\ncentralized issues.  \n(Motion to Compel Transcript of Proceedings at 12-13 (Rep. App. Tab 14).)2  Kmart naturally\nargues that its centralized policies are sufficient to ensure compliance with the ADA.  (Id. at 13; \nsee also Class Opp. at 15-16.)  Named Plaintiffs disagree and have demonstrated that Kmart’s\ncentralized policies and/or policy failures cause discriminatory barriers to customers who use\nwheelchairs.  (See Class Mem. at 17-25.)  Although the resolution of the question whether\n2  The appendix submitted with Named Plaintiffs’ Class Memorandum will be\nreferred to as “App.”; the appendix submitted with this Reply Brief will be referred to as “Rep.\nApp.” \n-4-\n\nKmart’s policies are sufficient to prevent discrimination goes to the merits of this case, the\nquestion itself is common to the class and should be answered on a classwide basis. \nWhere named plaintiffs challenge centralized policies, class certification is appropriate.\nSee J.B. ex rel. Hart v. Valdez, 186 F.3d 1280, 1288 (10th Cir. 1999) (holding that the fact “‘that\nthe claims of individual class members may differ factually should not preclude certification\nunder Rule 23(b)(2) of a claim seeking the application of a common policy’”) (quoting Adamson\nv. Bowen, 855 F.2d 668, 676 (10th Cir. 1988)).3  Courts in a variety of situations have held that\nquestions concerning policies or the lack thereof meet the commonality requirement.  For\nexample, in Lightbourn v. County of El Paso, Texas, 118 F.3d 421 (5th Cir. 1997), cert. denied\n522 U.S. 1052 (1998), and National Org. on Disability v. Tartaglione, No. Civ. A. 01-1923, 2001\nWL 1258089 (E.D.Pa. Oct. 22, 2001) (Rep. App. Tab 23), both of which involved challenges by\nclasses of individuals with disabilities to inaccessible polling places, the commonality\nrequirement was met because the defendants did not have policies in place “direct[ing] local\nelection officials to comply with [29 U.S.C. § 794]  and the ADA” by making polling places\naccessible.  Lightbourn, 118 F.3d at 426; see also Tartaglione,  2001 WL 1258089 at *3\n(allegation that defendant failed to have policies ensuring that voters with mobility impairments\nhad access to neighborhood polling places was an allegation that defendant “engaged in a\n3 This would be so even if Kmart had put on competent evidence that its policies\nwere decentralized.  In Faulk v. Home Oil Co., 184 F.R.D. 645 (M.D. Ala. 1999), the court held\nthat where there is “substantial evidence” of centralization, it is appropriate to find commonality\nand typicality, even where the defendant offers evidence of decentralization, because to resolve\nthat factual dispute would be to address the merits.  Id. at 656; see also Orlowski v. Dominick’s\nFiner Foods, Inc., 172 F.R.D. 370, 373-74 (N.D. Ill. 1997) (same); Meiresonne v. Marriott Corp.,\n124 F.R.D. 619, 622-23 (N.D. Ill. 1989) (same).  \n-5-\n\ncommon course of conduct on a classwide . . .  basis”).  Similarly, in a recently-certified\nemployment class action, the court held that a class of Deaf employees satisfied commonality\nwhere they challenged the employer’s policy requiring all employees to pass certain hearing\nstandards.  Bates v. United Parcel Svc., No. C99-2216 TEH, --- F. Supp. 2d ---, 2001 WL\n1482023 at *4 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 1, 2001) (Rep. App. Tab 18).4 \nFurther, even under Kmart’s formulation that its “operations are centralized in direction\nonly and decentralized in application of that direction,” (see Class Opp. at 15), the commonality\nrequirement is met.  Classes of employees are often certified challenging a centralized policy of\noverdelegation of authority to local managers that fails to prevent discrimination.  See, e.g.,\nCaridad v. Metro-North Commuter R.R., 191 F.3d 283, 291-92 (2d Cir. 1999) (reversing denial\nof commonality based on the defendant’s policy of “delegating discretionary authority to\nsupervisors to make certain employment decisions affecting discipline and promotion”), cert.\ndenied 529 U.S. 1107 (2000); Shipes v. Trinity Indus., 987 F.2d 311, 316 (5th Cir. 1993)\n(holding that “[a]llegations of similar discriminatory employment practices, such as the use of\nentirely subjective personnel processes that operate to discriminate, satisfy the commonality and\ntypicality requirements of Rule 23(a).”); Cox v. American Cast Iron Pipe Co., 784 F.2d 1546,\n1557 (11th Cir.) (same), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 883 (1986); Beckmann v. CBS, Inc., 192 F.R.D.\n608, 613-14 (D. Minn. 2000) (same); Shores v. Publix Super Markets, Inc., No. 95-1162-CIV-T-\n25(E), 1996 WL 407850 at *6 (M.D. Fla. March 12, 1996) (Declaration of Shana T. Mintz in\n4 See also cases cited infra n. 8.  \n-6-\n\nOpposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification (“Mintz Decl.”) Ex. 6) (same).5  Thus,\nthe autonomy Kmart claims to delegate to its stores, (see Class Opp. at 3, 17), far from defeating\nclass certification, presents a question common to the class:  Has Kmart permitted its managers\nto use subjective criteria and thereby tolerated disability discrimination? \nThe holdings set forth above make sense.  Where plaintiffs allege that they have suffered\ndiscrimination as a result of inadequate centralized policies, they have by definition raised a\ncommon issue.  Further, if the policies are found to be inadequate, it is much more efficient to\nremedy the policies at their source rather than to conduct piece-meal, store-by-store lawsuits that\nlikely will result in inconsistent standards.\nB. Putative Class Members Allege Common Discriminatory Experiences and\nAny Individual Differences are Irrelevant.  \nKmart argues that class members’ experiences are not common because the physical\nlayouts of its stores are different from one another and because “Plaintiffs have not identified a\nsingle barrier that is the same in all Kmart stores, or even one that they and their witnesses have\nfound to be present all the times they visited even one given Kmart store.”  (Class Opp. at 5 n.3\n(emphasis in original).)  In other words, it is not enough for Kmart that many class members\nhave been blocked by clothing racks that Kmart policy permits to be only 24 inches apart, or by\n5 This doctrine had its origin in a footnote to General Telephone Company of the\nSouthwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 159 n.15 (1982).  Falcon held that so-called “across the\nboard” classes that included employees and applicants could not automatically be certified based\nonly on evidence of discrimination against the former.  Id. at 158.  The Supreme Court provided\nseveral examples of the type of evidence that would support certification, including\n“[s]ignificant proof that an employer operated under a general policy of discrimination . . .  such\nas through entirely subjective decisionmaking processes.”  Id. 159 n.15. \n-7-\n\naisle displays required by Kmart’s merchandising guides, or by other obstructions that Kmart\npolicy is inadequate to prevent.  Rather, Kmart appears to require that putative class members\nhave been blocked by the same clothes or the same displays or the same obstructions that remain\nin the same position all the times they visited any Kmart anywhere in the country.  \nThis is not what Rule 23 requires.  Named Plaintiffs’ opening brief cited a number of\ncases in which classes of individuals with disabilities had been certified with no requirement of\nidentical architectural or physical barriers, and Kmart failed to address or distinguish most of\nthese cases.6  Indeed, Kmart’s argument that individuals with mobility impairments who have\nencountered systematic discrimination that does not involve an identical, physical barrier cannot\nbe certified as a class sets the standard for certification of classes of such individuals far higher\nthan for classes of individuals belonging to any other protected category.  \nKmart’s analysis goes astray by focusing on the impact of its policies, rather than on the\npolicies themselves.  Numerous courts have held that the commonality requirement is met where\na common policy impacts individual class members in differing ways.7  For example, the Ninth\n6 See, e.g., Class Mem. at 28 n.88 & 29 n.89 and cases cited therein.\n7 Named Plaintiffs cited a number of cases in their Class Memorandum in which\nclass members’ circumstances varied more significantly than those of Kmart shoppers who use\nwheelchairs or scooters.  See id. at 35 & n. 96.  Kmart attempts to distinguish these cases by\narguing that they “involv[ed] discriminatory policies in effect at a single location managed by a\nsingle group of individuals.”  Class Opp. at 65 n.53.  With respect to most of these cases,\nKmart’s description is simply wrong.  See Hill v. Amoco Oil Co., No. 97 C 7501, 2001 U.S.\nDist. LEXIS 3082 at *2 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 15, 2001) (App. Tab 23) (addressing “Amoco owned and\noperated gas stations in the Chicago area”); Thomas County Branch of the Nat’l Ass’n for the\nAdvancement of Colored People v. City of Thomasville Sch. Dist., 187 F.R.D. 690, 693 (M.D.\nGa. 1999) (addressing a school district’s elementary, middle and high schools as well as its\n(continued...)\n-8-\n\nCircuit has recently upheld the certification of a class of individuals with hearing, vision,\nlearning, developmental and mobility impairments challenging accommodations provided by a\nstate parole board.  Armstrong v. Davis, No. 00-15132, --- F.3d ---, 2001 WL 1506518  at *2\n(9th Cir. Nov. 28, 2001) (Rep. App. Tab 16).  In response to the defendants’ argument that\nseparate classes should be certified for each type of impairment, the Ninth Circuit held, “in a\ncivil-rights suit, . . . commonality is satisfied where the lawsuit challenges a system-wide\npractice or policy that affects all of the putative class members.  . . . In such circumstance,\nindividual factual differences among the individual litigants or groups of litigants will not\npreclude a finding of commonality.”  Id. at *13 (citations omitted).  The court in Daniels v. City\nof New York, 198 F.R.D. 409 (S.D.N.Y. 2001), certified a class of minorities who had been\nsubjected to unreasonable searches on the basis of racial profiling.  Id. at 411, 422.  The\ndefendants objected that each class member’s circumstances would be highly individualized. \nThe court responded that Rule 23(b)(2) classes -- the type Named Plaintiffs seek to certify here --\n“have been certified in a legion of civil rights cases where commonality findings were based\nprimarily on the fact that defendant’s conduct is central to the claims of all class members\nirrespective of their individual circumstances and the disparate effects of the conduct.”  Id. at\n416 (quoting Baby Neal ex rel. Kanter v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 57 (3d Cir. 1994)); see also Miller\n7(...continued)\ngifted and special education programs); Hewlett v. Premier Salons Int’l, Inc., 185 F.R.D. 211,\n213 (D.

Even Classes Challenging Physical Barriers Do Not Require Identical\nPhysical Barriers.  \nEven cases in which individuals with disabilities challenge physical barriers have not\nrequired that those barriers be identical as a prerequisite for class certification.

The classes were certified without any suggestion -- and, indeed, it defies\n8(...continued)\nchildren with asthma; because only injunctive relief sought, “the precise ways that various\nmembers of the class may have been injured is less relevant than the fact that a continuing policy\nor practice may be causing harm to many of the class members.”); Risinger ex rel.

Me. 2001) (certifying class of individuals not timely\nreceiving in-home mental health services despite the fact that class members’ “different\ndiagnoses require different treatments,” as plaintiffs challenged defendants’ “system of\nscreening, diagnosis, and delivery of prescribed in-home mental health services”); Karen L. ex\nrel.

Cellucci, 107 F. Supp. 2d 61, 81 (D. Mass. \n2000) (certifying class of individuals on waiting list for Medicaid services despite “unique\nmedical and support requirements” of each).  \nDecisions certifying employment discrimination classes often describe very different\nindividual circumstances of class members challenging a centralized policy.  See, e.g., Reeb v.\nOhio Dep’t of Rehabilitation, 203 F.R.D. 315, 318 (S.D. Ohio 2001) (certifying class of female\nemployees despite different types of discrimination suffered); Beckmann v. CBS, Inc., 192\nF.R.D. 608, 611-14 (D. Minn. 2000) (certifying class of female employees in which one named\nplaintiff excluded from overtime assignments, another turned down for promotions that went to\nmales, another did not receive same training as males); Bremiller v. Cleveland Psychiatric Inst.,\n195 F.R.D. 1, 6-18 (N.D.Ohio 2000) (certifying class of female employees challenging sexual\nharassment in the workplace despite differences in experiences of named plaintiffs); Haynes v.\nShoney’s, Inc., No. 89-30093-RV, 1992 WL 752127 at *1, 2-6, 20 (N.D. Fla. Jun 22, 1992)\n(Rep. App. Tab 22) (certifying class of female employees alleging, variously, that “the\ndefendants have discriminatorily failed to hire, failed to promote, harassed, discharged,\nconstructively discharged, and retaliated against” them).  \n-11-\n\nreason to suggest -- that every polling place in El Paso or Philadelphia was physically identical\nto every other.  Instead, the classes were certified because of the failure of the defendant to\nensure that the physical facilities were accessible.  See Lightbourn, 118 F.3d at 425; Tartaglione,\n 2001 WL 1258089 at *3.  Likewise, Kmart has failed to ensure that its stores are accessible to\ncustomers in wheelchairs, making class certification appropriate.  \nIdentical barriers were also not required in Access Now, Inc. v. Ambulatory Surgery\nCenter Group, Ltd., 197 F.R.D. 522 (S.D. Fla. 2000) or Access Now, Inc. v. AHM CGH, Inc.,\nCase No. 98-3004, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14788 (S.D. Fla. Jul. 12, 2000) (App. Tab 16).  In\nthese two cases, the named plaintiffs were seeking certification of nationwide classes of persons\nwith disabilities challenging alleged violations of the ADA at a series of affiliated -- though not\ncommonly owned -- health care facilities.  In contrast to the present case -- which addresses only\nKmart stores owned and operated by the Kmart Corporation -- the facilities at issue in AHM\nincluded “ambulatory surgical centers, specialty clinics, and medical office buildings,” id. at *4,\nand in Ambulatory Surgery, “specialty hospitals, outpatient care, rehabilitation hospitals,\nprofessional medical offices, surgical units, psychiatric hospitals, medical office buildings, and\ngeneral services hospitals.”  Id. at 526.  In both cases, despite the wide variety in types of\nfacilities, the court held that the class satisfied the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a)(3).9  \n9 Kmart attempts to distinguish Ambulatory Surgery and AHM by stating that the\ncourt in each provided “little of its reasoning or the factual basis for its decisions” and that the\ncases appear to have been challenging “specific ‘architectural features,’ which were common to\nall of the defendants’ facilities.”  Class Opp. at 63 (emphasis in original). This is incorrect:  As\nset forth in text above, the courts provided the precise factual bases for their decisions, and\nincluded explicit mention that they covered a wide range of types of facilities.\n-12-\n\nKmart’s attempt to distinguish two other physical-barrier-discrimination cases cited by\nNamed Plaintiffs also fail.  Kmart asserts that in Arnold v. United Artists Theatre Circuit, Inc.,\n158 F.R.D. 439 (N.D. Cal. 1994), “accessible seating was the only ADA violation alleged.” \n(Class Opp. at 62 (emphasis in original).)  This is incorrect.  The Arnold plaintiffs challenged the\nnumber and placement of disabled seating, barriers to accessible paths of travel, and inaccessible\nrestrooms.  Id. at 445, 447.  Significantly, the second of these categories is a broad description of\nmay of the barriers challenged by Named Plaintiffs here:  Obstacles in merchandise aisles and\nsidewalk displays as well as inaccessible clothing racks are simply barriers to accessible paths of\ntravel.  There was, in any event, no suggestion that each theater at issue in Arnold had the same\nlayout or design.\nFinally, Kmart challenges Named Plaintiffs’ reliance on Farrar-Kuhn v. Conoco Inc.,\nCivil Action No. 99-WM-2086 (D. Colo. Aug. 22, 2000) (App. Tab 21), on the grounds that the\nmotion for class certification was uncontested.  Kmart asserts that “[a]lthough the Farrar-Kuhn\ncourt purported to undertake a full analysis of the requirements of Rule 23, pursuant to Amchem\nProds., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 614 (1997), it is evident from its order that its analysis\nwas substantially truncated by the defendant’s concessions.  Thus, the decision is of little\nprecedential value.”  (Class Opp. at 64.)  That the motion was uncontested was stated clearly in\nNamed Plaintiffs’ Class Memorandum.  (Id. at 29 n.89. )  There is no indication in Judge\nMiller’s opinion, however, that he did anything other than follow the mandate of the Supreme\nCourt in Amchem to assess the appropriateness for certification of an uncontested class as\nrigorously as a contested one.  This assessment resulted in the certification of a class very much\n-13-\n\nlike the one now before this Court:  A class of individuals who use wheelchairs challenging the\npolicies and barriers of a chain of retailers.  Kmart also asserts, without evidence, that “there is\nsurely little, if any, real variation in the physical attributes, inventory, management, etc., of\nConoco’s service stations.”  (Class Opp. at 64.)  To the contrary, Judge Miller’s Order noted that\n“[t]he plaintiffs alleged that Conoco Corporate Stations have various architectural barriers and\npolicies that discriminate against persons who use wheelchairs . . .”  Farrar-Kuhn, slip op. at 1.  \nD. The Macy’s East, Burdines, and May Cases Are Distinguishable.\n  Kmart relies heavily on Access Now, Inc. v. Burdines, Inc., No. 99-3214-CIV (S.D. Fla.\nFeb. 15, 2001), Access Now, Inc. v. Macy’s East, Inc., No. 99-9088-CIV (S.D. Fla. Feb 15,\n2001) (Mintz Decl. Exs. 1 & 2), and Access Now, Inc. v. May Dep’t Stores Co., No. 00-148-CIV\n(S.D. Fla. Oct. 6, 2000) (First Legal Supplement to Defendant Kmart Corporation’s\nMemorandum in Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification (“First Leg. Supp.”) Ex.\n2).  Although the court in each of these cases denied certification to a class of individuals with\ndisabilities challenging barriers in a chain of department stores, they are distinguishable from the\npresent case.  In each of the three cases, the court relied on the fact that  the “plaintiffs [had]  . . . \nfailed to show that [the defendant] maintains corporate policies that cause certain barriers to be\nmaintained . . ..”  Macy’s East, slip op. at 2; see also Burdines, slip op. at 3 (same); May, slip op.\nat 3 (stating that the complaint “only alleges specific violations -- as opposed to a uniform policy\n. . .”).10  Indeed, the May plaintiffs -- seeking to certify a nationwide class -- “did not provide any\n10 This is because, in each case, no discovery had been conducted prior to the filing\nof motions for class certification.  See Paradis Decl. ¶ 5 (Rep. App. Tab 2); Dietz Decl. ¶ 4 (Rep.\n(continued...)\n-14-\n\ndetail concerning ADA violations outside the state of Florida . . .”  Id., slip op. at 3.  Lacking\nevidence of a common policy, the courts in these three cases based their decision on their failure\nto find “a uniform design flaw or structural defect in Defendant’s stores nationwide.”  Id., slip\nop. at 4; see also Burdines, slip op. at 3 (same); Macy’s East, slip op. at 2.  These cases are thus\nnot relevant to the analysis of the present case, in which the Named Plaintiffs have placed before\nthe Court extensive evidence of centralized Kmart policies and policy failures that cause barriers\nto be maintained, as well as testimony about such barriers from 50 individuals at Kmart stores in\n26 states and evidence from Kmart’s mystery shoppers, in-house ADA surveys and other\nrecently-commissioned surveys that show a consistent pattern of barriers and violations at Kmart\nstores around the country.  See infra at 20-21, 53-55.  To the extent these three cases hold that a\n“uniform design flaw” is a prerequisite for certification of a class of individuals with disabilities,\nas explained above, they are wrong and, in any event, they are irrelevant here.\nKmart also relies on objections filed by the DOJ to a proposed settlement of the May\ncase.  Kmart asserts that the DOJ “contend[ed] that the proposed class covering 382 department\nstores nationwide should not be approved, even for settlement purposes, because the proposed\nclass did not satisfy Rule 23(a).”  (First Leg. Supp. at 4.)  This misconstrues the DOJ’s\nobjections.  Gretchen Jacobs, the DOJ attorney who prepared the objections on which Kmart\nrelies, explains that “[t]he portrait that Kmart attempts to paint of the United States’ May\nobjections is flawed in several respects.”  (Jacobs Decl. ¶ 4 (Rep. App. Tab 1).)\n10(...continued)\nApp. Tab 3).  Laurence Paradis was counsel for the plaintiffs in Macy’s East and Burdines. \nParadis Decl. ¶ 4.  Matthew Dietz was counsel for the plaintiffs in May.  Dietz Decl. ¶ 3.\n-15-\n\nKmart creates the misleading impression that the United States opposed the May\nsettlement agreement on the sole ground that the class proposed therein (e.g.,\npersons with disabilities and their shopping companions who shopped at May\ndepartment stores nationwide) failed to satisfy Rule 23(a) of the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure.\n(Id. ¶ 3.)  In fact, because the DOJ entered the case as an amicus curiae at the settlement stage, it\ndid not take a position on the propriety of class certification.  (Id. ¶ 7.)   Instead, the DOJ’s\nobjections concerned procedure -- that a class that had earlier been denied certification could not,\nunder Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591 (1997), be certified for settlement\npurposes -- and the substance of the settlement itself.  (Jacobs Decl. ¶¶ 4-6.)  Ms. Jacobs\nconcludes by stating that \nthe United States’ objections to the May agreement should not be read as either a\ngeneral indictment against class actions in ADA actions, or, more specifically, an\nargument against disability-based class actions against department store chains. \n. . . It is inaccurate to allege that the Department believes that classwide claims\nunder title III of the ADA against department stores, or any other place of public\naccommodation subject to the ADA, should not be permitted to proceed as class\nactions.  Rather, the appropriateness of class certification must be evaluated on a\ncase-by-case basis.  \n(Id. ¶ 8.)  \nE. It Is Not Necessary That Every Class Member Experience Discrimination\nDuring Every Visit to Kmart in Order to Certify a Class.\nKmart also argues that Named Plaintiffs’ and putative class members’ discriminatory\nexperiences at Kmart cannot be common because these same individuals have also had non-\ndiscriminatory experiences at Kmart.  Kmart also references several positive comments that\nNamed Plaintiffs’ counsel received from class members concerning Kmart stores.  The fact that\nsome potential class members have had both discriminatory and non-discriminatory experiences\n-16-\n\nand that some have positive things to say about Kmart does not detract in any way from the\ncommonality of class members’ discriminatory experiences or the appropriateness of class\ncertification.  \nThe Tenth Circuit has approved class certification even where it was possible that the\nclass included some members who approved of the challenged policy.  See Lanner v. Wimmer,\n662 F.2d 1349, 1357 (10th Cir. 1981).  The best Kmart has been able to do is show instances in\nwhich the challenged conduct has not occurred; it has not produced testimony or evidence\nsuggesting that there are Kmart shoppers with disabilities who approve of closed accessible\ncheckout aisles, obstructed merchandise aisles, narrow clothing aisles, insufficient or blocked\nparking, and inaccessible or blocked restrooms or fitting rooms.  Yet, as the Lanner case\ndemonstrates, even such implausible evidence would not be sufficient to defeat class\ncertification.11 \nMany courts have certified classes in the face of explicit evidence that fewer than all of\nthe class members have experienced the challenged conduct.  For example, in Cox v. American\nCast Iron Pipe Co., 784 F.2d 1546 (11th Cir. 1986), a case alleging sex discrimination in\nemployment, the defendant presented interrogatory responses from class members containing\n“assertions both of no discrimination and of no opinion about discrimination.”  Id. at 1557.  The\ndistrict court relied on these responses in part in denying class certification.  The Eleventh\n11 One potential class member, while not endorsing the challenged conduct, does\nappear to disapprove of the use of a class action in this circumstance.  See Mintz Decl. Ex. 15. \nThis, too, is not a barrier to class certification.  See Siddiqi, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19930 at\n*25.\n-17-\n\nCircuit reversed, holding that, “[a]t best, the trial judge could only conclude from these answers\nthat some specific claims might not be held by all class members.  But Rule 23 does not require\nthat all the questions of law and fact raised by the dispute be common.”  Id.  Similarly, in Shores\nv. Publix Super Markets, Inc., 1996 WL 407850 (M.D. Fla. March 12, 1996), also a sex\ndiscrimination case, the defendant submitted “hundreds of affidavits from women who believe[d]\nthat they [had] not been discriminated against.”  Id. at *3.  The court concluded that \n[t]he fact that a large number of potential class members are satisfied with the\nstatus quo, or are unwilling to come forward, cannot defeat class certification.  . . .\n[P]laintiffs cannot be precluded from asserting their right to be free from\ndiscrimination merely because other employees chose not to assert those rights. \nId.

Celani, 987 F.2d 931, 934 (2d Cir. 1993) (upholding\ncertification of a class of individuals challenging delays in state assistance; court cites statistics\nshowing only two to fifteen percent of the cases were delayed); Hill v. Amoco Oil Co., 2001\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 3082 at *18 (holding that the fact that a civil rights class may include\nindividuals who did not actually suffer discrimination does not defeat commonality); Joseph v.\nGeneral Motors Corp., 109 F.R.D. 635, 640 (D. Colo. 1986) (holding that the existence of\n“satisfied customers” in products liability case did not defeat class certification).\nF. Disability Discrimination at Kmart Stores Is Pervasive and Repeated, Not\nIsolated or Temporary.\n-18-\n\nKmart attempts to minimize the commonality of Named Plaintiffs’ and putative class\nmembers’ experiences by characterizing them as isolated,12 temporary,13 fleeting,14 sporadic,15\nand episodic.16  While this may appear simply to be argument-by-thesaurus, at least the first two\nadjectives are rooted in law.  Where the ADA requires access, that access must be maintained. \n28 C.F.R. § 36.211(a).  That provision “does not prohibit isolated or temporary interruptions in\nservice or access due to maintenance or repairs.”  Id. § 36.211(b).  The DOJ commentary to this\nregulation explains further, however, that “[f]ailure of the public accommodation to ensure that\naccessible routes are properly maintained and free of obstructions  . . . would . . . violate this\npart.”  Preamble to Regulation on Nondiscrimination on The Basis of Disability by Public\nAccommodations and in Commercial Facilities, 28 C.F.R. pt. 36, app. B (2000) (“Preamble”) at\n638.  As an initial matter, then, the question whether barriers are isolated or temporary goes to\nthe merits of the case and is inappropriate for resolution at this time.  The question is, in fact, a\ncommon one shared by the class:  Has Kmart properly ensured that accessible routes -- for\nexample, shelves, clothing racks, restrooms, and fitting rooms -- are properly maintained and\nfree of obstructions?  \n12 Class Opp. at 2, 4, 5, 19, 21, 22, 24, 30, 31, 32, 34, 41-42, 48 n.45, 55, 56, 57, and\n73-74.\n13 Id. at 2, 4, 5, 19, 21, 22, 24, 25, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33, 44, 55, 56, 57, and 76. \n14 Id. at 2, 24, and 23 n.24.\n15 Id. at 33, 55, and 73-74. \n16 Id. at 22, 29 n. 30, 44, 56, 57, and 63.  \n-19-\n\nWhether the question goes to the merits or to the class certification motion currently\nbefore this Court, it is clear that barriers to Kmart customers who use wheelchairs are neither\nisolated nor temporary.   In their opening brief, Named Plaintiffs identified 81 individuals who\nhad experienced discrimination at Kmart stores, provided testimony from 50 of them and\nprovided evidence that Kmart had received relevant complaints from another 259 individuals. \n(Class Mem. at 12.)   Named Plaintiffs also provided extensive evidence of centralized Kmart\npolicies and policy failures that cause systematic discrimination against disabled customers.  (Id.\nat 18-23.)  In response to Kmart’s assertion (among others) that Named Plaintiffs’ and putative\nclass members’ experiences were isolated and temporary, Named Plaintiffs moved to compel\nforms filled out by “mystery shoppers” who were hired to shop at Kmart stores and both to\nrespond to a series of “yes/no” questions and to provide written comments for each shopping\ntrip.  Named Plaintiffs’ counsel analyzed comments from 68,301 shopping trips during the\nperiod February 1999 to August 2000.  Of these comments, at least 19,406 or 28.4% include\ndescriptions of clutter and other obstructions that pose barriers to customers in wheelchairs. \n(Fox Decl. ¶¶ 3-13 & Ex. 2 (Rep. App. Tab 13).)17   For example, shoppers made comments such\n17 The period within which these data were gathered is well within the statute of\nlimitations, as this case was filed in October, 1999.  Kmart asserts that recent training concerning\ncustomers with disabilities “does not introduce any new concepts,” essentially asserting that its\npolicies and training have not changed materially since 1992.  See Class Opp. at 11, 16.  As\nsuch, these data are relevant to the present suit.  The customer service survey system that Kmart\nput in place after August, 2000, did not ask questions directed to clutter or obstructions; rather its\nopen-ended questions -- posed to shoppers who called a toll-free number -- asked generally what\nthose shoppers did and did not like about Kmart.  See Second Robertson Decl. Ex. 21.  Even so,\nfor example, in September, 2001, 6.1% of the 1000 calls analyzed by the vendor complained\nabout “crowded aisles.”   See id. Ex. 22.  The vendor uses this percentage and applies it to the\n(continued...)\n-20-\n\nas “some aisles not able to enter, for stacks of boxes, merchandise, etc. in them,” (id. at 1 (6/2/00\nentry)), “area is too cluttered -- it is hard to get cart through,” (id. at 3 (11/8/99 entry)), and\n“aisles had lots of boxes, very crowded and difficult to get through,” (id. at 8 (4/1/99 entry)).\nThese incidents were well-distributed across the Kmart chain:  of the 2,090 stores\nshopped, mystery shoppers reported relevant problems at 2,035 of them.  Id.  Summary\nmemoranda submitted by the vendor providing mystery shopper services regularly confirmed\nthat the reports showed cluttered aisles.  (See, e.g., Second Robertson Decl. Ex. 12 at K35524\n(March 2000: 13% of all floors were either dirty or cluttered); Ex. 14  (May 2000:  20% of aisles\nand 13% of store floors were dirty or cluttered); Ex. 15 (June 2000: 15% to 20% of shoppers\nreported that aisles were cluttered); Ex. 16 (July 2000:  16% to 20% of shoppers reported that\naisles were cluttered).)  Although we do not know precisely how many individuals in\nwheelchairs were obstructed by each of these reported obstacles, they rebut Kmart’s claims that\nthe experiences of putative class members were isolated and temporary.  \nPutting aside the company-wide policies that permit or even mandate barriers to\nindividuals with disabilities -- which barriers are, by definition, neither isolated nor temporary --\nthese numbers and the results of a survey commissioned by Kmart this past summer make clear\nthat disability discrimination is neither isolated nor temporary at Kmart.  While no case has\n17(...continued)\ntotal commenting respondents; applying this method to the 6.1% figure would project that 1,804\nindividuals had similar complaints that month.  See id. at 3; see also Second Robertson Decl. Ex\n23 (excerpts from the deposition of Tammy Pretre) at 12-13.   In any event, surveys performed\nfor Kmart this summer confirm the continued presence of these barriers.  See infra Section\nVIII.A.\n-21-\n\nanalyzed 28 C.F.R. § 36.211(b) in depth,18 one court’s analysis of an identical provision in the\nADA transportation regulations suggests that a discrimination rate as low as 3% cannot be\nconsidered isolated or temporary.  The plaintiffs in Cupolo v. Bay Area Rapid Transit, 5 F. Supp.\n2d 1078 (N.D. Cal. 1997), individuals who used wheelchairs, were suing BART, San Francisco’s\nrapid transit authority, alleging that BART’s elevators were often out of order.  BART asserted\nthat problems with its elevators were isolated and temporary and therefore excusable under 49\nC.F.R. § 37.161(c), which contains “isolated or temporary” language identical to that of 28\nC.F.R. § 36.211(b).  BART provided evidence that elevators were available over 97% of the\ntime.  Cupolo, at 1080-81.  The court held that “the problems encountered by class members are\nnot simply isolated or temporary interruptions due to maintenance or repairs.”  Id. at 1083.19 \nThat is, a barrier that arose 3% of the time was not isolated or temporary.  The mystery shopper\ncomments analyzed above suggest that barriers occur at Kmart stores at least 28% of the time. \nResults of Kmart’s “expert” survey -- discussed in greater detail in Section VIII.A below -- and\nits own in-house ADA surveys show various ADA violations occurring at rates ranging from 6%\nto 46%.  (See Second Robertson Decl. Exs. 1-5).  \n18 The only case that mentions 28 C.F.R. 36.211 states simply that “defendant must\nperiodically monitor and maintain all such equipment to ensure that it continues to comply with\nthe Title III Standards,” and that “Title III regulations expressly require that accessible features\nand equipment be maintained in operable working condition.”  Independent Living Resources v.\nOregon Arena Corp., 1 F. Supp. 2d 1124, 1136, 1142 n.11 (D. Or. 1998). \n19 BART also argued that any elevator problems were promptly repaired and that it\nprovided alternative transportation when elevators were out of order.  The court rejected this,\nholding that the regulations “do not provide that prompt repair and reasonable accommodations\nserve as defenses to claims of ADA violations.”  Id. at 1083-84.  \n-22-\n\n Cases relied on by Kmart are not to the contrary, as each addresses only a single instance\nof discrimination.  None arose in the context of a putative class action with evidence of repeated\nviolations and centralized policies that caused the barriers or violations in question.  See\nAnderson v. Ross Stores, Inc., No. C99-4056, 2000 WL 1585269 at * 1 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 10,\n2000) (Mintz Decl. Ex. 3) (challenging a single instance in which plaintiff requested a\nreasonable accommodation); Tanner v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Civ. No. 99-44-JD, 2000 U.S.\nDist. LEXIS 1444, *16-17 (D.N.H. Feb. 8, 2000) (Mintz Decl. Ex. 8) (challenging a single\nincident on which the defendant failed to remove ice and snow from its parking lot); Pack v.\nArkansas Valley Corr. Facility, 894 P. 2d 34, 39 (Colo. App. 1993) (same).  Kmart is essentially\narguing that each time an individual disabled Kmart shopper encounters a discriminatory barrier,\nthat experience stands alone and cannot be analyzed together with all of the other experiences\nand policies demonstrated in Named Plaintiffs’ Class Memorandum.  This runs counter not only\nto common sense, but to the words of Kmart’s lead counsel, written in describing the role of\nstatistics in civil rights cases: “Discrimination is more likely to be a systemic condition related to\nwidespread practices than a series of isolated events . . ..”  Walter B. Connolly, Jr., David W.\nPeterson &  Michael J. Connolly, Use of Statistics in Equal Employment Opportunity Litigation\n§ 1.01 (1980 & Supp. 2000).  \nG. Cases on Which Kmart Relies Are Distinguishable.\nKmart relies on a number of cases to attempt to defeat Named Plaintiffs’ arguments for\ncommonality.  All are distinguishable.  For example, Kmart cites to several cases in which the\nplaintiffs were attempting to certify a class under Rule 23(b)(3) and/or to maintain claims for\n-23-\n\ndamages for individual class members.  Clopton v. Budget Rent A Car, 197 F.R.D. 502, 506-07\n(N.D. Ala. 2000); Demkowitz v. Endry, 411 F. Supp. 1184, 1194-95 (S.D. Ohio 1975); Faulk,\n184 F.R.D. at 662-63.  Named Plaintiffs here move to certify a class under Rule 23(b)(2) and do\nnot seek damages on behalf of the class.  Because the entitlement of any one class member to\ndamages requires a more individualized evaluation than the entitlement of a class to injunctive\nrelief, and because Rule 23(b)(3) requires common questions to “predominate” over individual\nones -- a requirement not found in Rule 23(b)(2), see Adamson v. Bowen, 855 F.2d 668, 676\n(10th Cir. 1988) -- these cases are inapposite.  \nKmart also relies on several cases for the proposition that class certification is\ninappropriate where multiple facilities are involved.  For example, Kmart cites the Faulk case\nwith the following parenthetical:  “‘the problem of multiple facilities creates a formidable barrier\nto class certification of the Plaintiffs’ . . . claims . . . [which] are sufficiently different that they\nwill require different proof to establish liability.’”  (Class Opp. at 50 (ellipses in original).)  In\nfact, the Faulk court held that Rule 23(a) commonality existed for a multiple-facility\nemployment class with respect to hiring and promotion claims but that it did not with respect to\nhostile environment claims.  The language Kmart purported to cite from Faulk in fact reads (with\nomitted text underlined):  “The problem of multiple facilities creates a formidable barrier to class\ncertification of the Plaintiffs’ hostile environment claims;” and, three paragraphs later, “In sum,\nthe Plaintiffs have established commonality and typicality with regard to Home Oil’s hiring and\npromotion practices.  They have not met the prerequisites with regard to their hostile\nenvironment claims.  The individual claims of hostile environment are sufficiently different that\n-24-\n\nthey will require different proof to establish liability.”  As noted above, the court ultimately\nrefused to certify any class on the grounds that it did not satisfy Rule 23(b)(3), not at issue in the\npresent case.  Id., 184 F.R.D. at 659.  Faulk thus supports Rule 23(a)(2) commonality here, as\nNamed Plaintiffs’ challenge to Kmart’s polices is analogous to the Faulk plaintiffs’ challenge to\nhiring and promotion policies, and does not require the individualized assessment of the class\nmembers’ state of mind that would have been required by a hostile environment class.  \nThe remainder of Kmart’s multiple-facility cases all present circumstances very different\nfrom the present case.  In Lott v. Westinghouse Savannah River Co., Inc., 200 F.R.D. 539\n(D.S.C. 2000), for example, the plaintiffs attempted to certify a class of employees that included\nall job classifications from general counsel to day laborers in a series of different types of\noperations ranging from “nuclear operations to firefighting to medical services to construction to\njanitorial services,” each of which had its own set of personnel procedures.  Id. at 554-55.  In\ncontrast,  Kmart concedes that it has a single Store Operating Policies manual, now being\nsupplanted by a single set of “Golden Rods” policy memoranda, for all of its stores.  (Class Opp.\nat 15.)  In several other multiple-facility cases cited by Kmart, the plaintiffs simply did not\nprovide evidence of centralized policies or support for the existence of claims other than those of\nnamed plaintiffs.  In Seidel v. General Motors Acceptance Corp., 93 F.R.D. 122 (W.D. Wash.\n1981), instead of rebutting defendant’s evidence of decentralization by pointing to centralized\npolicies, the plaintiffs offered only statistics showing “similar patterns and trends around the\ncountry, from which plaintiffs would have the Court infer that ‘[s]urely there must be a master\nplan.’”  Id. at 124.  In Stambaugh v. Kansas Dep’t of Corr., 151 F.R.D. 664 (D. Kan. 1993), the\n-25-\n\ncomplaint described two instances of alleged failure to promote on the basis of sex.  The  court\nheld that the plaintiffs had not given it “any basis to infer that beyond themselves are still more\nfemale employees who were denied upper-level promotions” on a discriminatory basis.  Id. at\n673 n.4; see also Bradford v. Sears, Roebuck and Co., 673 F.2d 792, 793, 795-96 (5th Cir. 1982)\n(reversing class certification because the defendant had submitted an unrebutted affidavit that its\npolicies differed from facility to facility); Bostron v. Apfel, 182 F.R.D. 188, 195-96 (D. Md.\n1998) (declining to certify a class of white, male Social Security employees, in part because “the\nrecord  . . . [was] essentially silent concerning the locus of autonomy in making the challenged\nemployment decisions . . ..”).  While relying on these inapposite cases, Kmart ignores many\ncases in which multiple-facility or nationwide classes have been certified.20 \nFinally, Kmart argues that the proposed class lacks commonality because it “rais[es]\nissues under state laws that vary across the states where class members may be found.”  (Class\nOpp. at 60 & n.50.)  No such state statutes are at issue in this litigation; rather, the proposed class\n20 See, e.g., Anderson v. Conejo, 199 F.R.D. 228, 267 (N.D. Ill. 2000) (certifying a\nnationwide case of women who had been subject to certain types of searches by Customs at any\nUnited States international airport); Butler v.

See Castano v. American Tobacco\nCo, 84 F.3d 734, 737, 741-44 (5th Cir. 1996) (declining to certify multi-state class of tobacco\nusers bringing state common law and statutory claims); Clay v. American Tobacco Co., 188\nF.R.D. 483, 487, 495  (S.D. Ill. 1999) (same); In re Jackson Nat’l Life Ins. Co. Premium Litig.,\n183 F.R.D. 217, 222-23  (W.D. Mich. 1998) (declining to certify multi-state class of purchasers\nof life insurance bringing state law fraud claims); In re Ford Motor Co. Ignition Switch Prod.\nLiab. Litig., 174 F.R.D. 332, 338, 340 (D.N.J. 1997) (declining to certify a multi-state class of\nautomobile purchasers bringing state and federal claims); Walsh v. Ford Motor Co., 130 F.R.D.\n260, 271 (D.D. C. 1990) (same), app. dism., 945 F.2d 1188 (D.C. Cir. 1991).  \nKmart also argues that compliance with the ADA “implicates” rights under various state\nand local access provisions, offering two examples of such provisions that require wider\naccessible parking spaces than the federal standards.  (See Class Opp. at 61.)  Named Plaintiffs\nmust, apparently, clarify that they will not seek to reduce wheelchair access at any Kmart store in\nany state.  Any Kmart store in compliance with more aggressive state or local standards would\nnot, by definition, be in violation of the ADA.  In Kmart’s parking space example, the width\n21 Although the Named Plaintiffs bring claims individually under Colorado law,\nthey do not assert these claims or other state claims on behalf of the class.  See Amended Class\nAction Complaint at 17.  This will not impact other class members’ state law claims.  See infra\nSections IV and V.A.  \n-27-\n\nprovided in the Department of Justice Standards for Accessible Design (“Standards”) is a\nminimum, id., 28 C.F.R. pt. 36, app. A, § 4.6.3, and spaces complying with the more generous\nCalifornia or Florida standards would not be in violation.  The fact that state statutes may\naddress the same subject matter as a federal statute at issue in a class action should not bar\ncertification, as classes are regularly certified under, for example, federal securities and\nemployment statutes regardless of the fact that rights under state statutes governing those same\nareas might be “implicated.”  \nII. Named Plaintiffs Have Demonstrated That Joinder is Impracticable.\nAs set forth in Named Plaintiffs’ Class Memorandum, there are more than two million\npersons age 15 and older in the United States who use wheelchairs and, as a matter of simple\nlogic, many of these potential class members are among the approximately 180 million\ncustomers each year who patronize the 2,100 Kmart stores located in all 50 states.  (See Class\nMem. at 30.)  Therefore joinder is impracticable.\nKmart does not dispute these statistics, nor does it argue that joinder in this case would\nbe practicable.  Instead it attacks the method used by Named Plaintiffs to estimate of the number\nof persons in the class as “pure conjecture.”  But the exact size of the class is irrelevant.  Because\n“the exact size of the class is unknown,” and the undisputed statistics demonstrate that it is\n“common sense that it is large, the Court will take judicial notice of this fact and will assume\nthat joinder is impracticable.”  2 Robert Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions § 7.22 at 7-77\n(1992 & 2001 Supp.) (“Newberg”); see also Butt v. Allegheny Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co., 116\n-28-\n\nF.R.D. 486, 488 (E.D. Va. 1987) (taking judicial notice that class was large and joinder\nimpracticable).\nIn any event, Named Plaintiffs used census statistics and Kmart’s own figures to estimate\nthat the class of Kmart shoppers who use wheelchairs likely numbers around 1,700,000.  This is\nin accord with the method approved in Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition v. Taco Bell Corp.,\n184 F.R.D. 354 (D. Colo. 1999), which held that the court may make “common sense\nassumptions” to support numerosity, including reliance on census figures.  Id. at 358.  Kmart\nattacks this analysis, relying in part on the case of Barlow v. Marion County Hosp., 88 F.R.D.\n619 (M.D. Fla. 1980) (cited in Class Opp. at 47).  The Barlow case, however, approved of a\nmethod much like that used by Named Plaintiffs here, holding that plaintiffs seeking to certify a\nclass of recipients of free or low-cost medical services satisfied the numerosity requirement\nwhen they used survey data to estimate the number of individuals eligible for services and\napplied the defendant’s figures for the rate of utilization in the general population to estimate the\nclass size.  Id. at 624, 625.  Here, Named Plaintiffs used census data of Americans who use\nwheelchairs and Kmart’s estimate that 85% of the population shops in its stores to estimate the\nclass size.  See also Miller v. Spring Valley Props., 202 F.R.D. 244, 248 (C.D. Ill. 2001)\n(certifying class of African-American applicants and renters in a fair housing case and approving\nmethod using total number of people who made appointments to see the defendants’ apartments\nand census data concerning number of African Americans in population). \nKmart also argues that Named Plaintiffs have not established a link between their\nestimate and the claims for which they seek certification, that is, that they have not demonstrated\n-29-\n\nhow many wheelchair-using Kmart shoppers have encountered discrimination at Kmart. \nHowever, it is very common, especially in a Rule 23(b)(2) class, for a class of individuals\nsubject to the discriminatory behavior to be certified, without precise proof of the number who\nhave actually experienced it.  For example, in Faulk, the court certified a class of African-\nAmerican employees where the plaintiffs identified 164 employees and 31 applicants “who\npotentially were affected by the alleged discriminatory policies.”  Id., 184 F.R.D. at 654.  The\ndefendants objected that the plaintiffs’ expert had identified only nine additional management\npositions that should have gone to African-Americans, suggesting that only nine individuals\nsuffered discrimination.  The court disagreed, holding that, because the plaintiffs challenged the\ndefendants’ practices, all of the individuals identified were appropriate class members, and thus\nnumerosity was satisfied.  Id., at 655. 22\nFinally, Kmart challenges Named Plaintiffs’ class definition on the grounds that it\ncontains no time limit.  Kmart relies only on cases in which the class sought damages and\n22   See also Karen L., 202 F.R.D. at 99 (holding numerosity satisfied where 77,000\nindividuals were eligible for the services in question, despite the fact that the plaintiffs did not\nallege that all eligible individuals had been injured, as “it [was] reasonable to assume that many\nof the enrollees have and many may experience such harm in the future” and that “the suit\nconcerns government policies that have been in place for some time.”).  A number of cases have\nheld, without analysis, that a class satisfies numerosity based only on statistics going to the\nnumber of individuals potentially affected by the challenged policy, without requiring an\nanalysis of how many were actually affected.  See, e.g. Tartaglione, 2001 WL 1258089 at *5\n(certifying class based on number of voters with disabilities, not number of same who had been\ndenied access to polling places); Civic Ass’n of the Deaf of New York City, Inc. v. Giuliani, 915\nF. Supp. 622, 634 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (certifying class based on number of Deaf New Yorkers, not\nnumber of same who had been unable to use call boxes); Arnold, 158 F.R.D. at 448 (certifying\nclass based on number of wheelchair users and semi-ambulatory persons in California and the\nconclusion that the “number of disabled persons affected by the alleged access violations” would\nbe large, rather than an estimate of those actually injured by the alleged discrimination).  \n-30-\n\nindividualized injunctive relief.  See Davoll v. Webb, 160 F.R.D. 142, 143 (D. Colo. 1995), aff’d\n194 F.3d 1116 (10th Cir. 1999); Daigle v. Shell Oil Co., 133 F.R.D. 600, 602 (D. Colo. 1990). \nIn contrast, the present case seeks only prospective, class-wide, injunctive relief, so there is little\nneed to determine precisely the contours of the class.  See Daniels, 198 F.R.D. at 416 (holding\nthat “general class descriptions based on the harm allegedly suffered by plaintiffs [are]\nacceptable in class actions seeking only declaratory and injunctive relief under Rule 23(b)(2)”)\n(citations omitted)).  That said, this Court has the discretion to adopt a class definition different\nfrom that in the complaint or motion, Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition, 184 F.R.D. at 357,\nand Named Plaintiffs do not object to a class definition that incorporates a two-year limitation.\nIII. Because Named Plaintiffs’ Claims Do Not Have Unique Defenses, Kmart’s Only\nArgument as to Typicality Fails.  \nKmart argues that typicality is not satisfied because Named Plaintiffs’ claims are subject\nto unique defenses.  In making this argument, Kmart points to a single defense that it alleges\ndiffers among its stores, not among Named Plaintiffs and putative class members.  The cases on\nwhich Kmart relies, however, involve defenses unique to a named plaintiff as an individual.  See\nHanon v. Dataproducts Corp., 976 F.2d 497, 508-09 (9th Cir. 1992) (holding that named plaintiff\nin securities class action had unique defense based on the questionability of his reliance on the\nintegrity of the market); Queen Uno Ltd. P’ship v. Coeur D’Alene Mines Corp., 183 F.R.D. 687,\n692 (D. Colo. 1998) (holding that named plaintiff in securities class action had unique defenses\nbecause it was a market maker in the stock in question).  Kmart does not cite to a case that holds\nthat typicality is defeated in a multiple-facility case by defenses that might apply to one facility\n-31-\n\nrather than another.  In any event, the single defense on which Kmart relies -- the “readily\nachievable” defense of § 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv) -- looks to the resources of the entire company\nrather than just that of the individual facility, see 28 C.F.R. § 36.104, and will be applicable to\nonly a handful of stores.  See infra at 40.  \nThe remainder of the cases cited by Kmart in opposition to typicality include three in\nwhich typicality was found to exist, see Kornberg v. Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc., 741 F.2d 1332,\n1337 (11th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1004 (1985), Neff v. VIA Metropolitan Transit\nAuthority, 179 F.R.D. 185, 194 (W.D. Tex. 1998), and Lightbourn, 118 F.3d at 426, and three\nthat are distinguishable from the present circumstances.  See Broussard v. Meineke Discount\nMuffler Shops, Inc., 155 F.3d 331, 340-42 (4th Cir. 1998) (holding typicality did not exist in\nfranchisee class action for breach of contract and fraud because named plaintiffs and class\nmembers were parties to different franchise agreements and because questions of reliance on\nmisrepresentations, tolling of statute of limitations and damages were individualized);\nButterworth v. Quick & Reilly, Inc., 171 F.R.D. 319, 321-22 (M.D. Fla. 1997) (holding\ntypicality did not exist in securities class action where cause of action depended on reliance by\neach class member on different representations); Hall v. Burger King Corp., No. 89-0260, 1992\nWL 372354 at *7 (S.D. Fla. Oct. 26, 1992) (Mintz Decl. Ex. 5) (holding typicality did not exist\nin race discrimination class action by franchisees as there was no common problem asserted by\nall named plaintiffs).  \nIV. Because Class Certification in the Present Case Will Not Have a Preclusive Effect\non Class Members’ State Law Claims, Kmart’s Only Argument as to\nRepresentation Fails. \n-32-\n\nKmart’s only objection to Named Plaintiffs’ ability adequately to represent the class is\nthat class claims for injunctive relief under Title III of the ADA would have a preclusive effect\non class members’ claims for damages under state disability discrimination laws.  Kmart relies\non a single Texas district court decision materially different from the case at bar.  (See Class\nOpp. at 67-71 (citing Zachery v. Texaco Exploration and Prod., Inc., 185 F.R.D. 230 (W.D. Tex.\n1999)).)  It is well established, however, that certification of a class seeking only injunctive or\ndeclaratory relief does not preclude individual damage actions by class members.  Indeed, any\ncontrary rule would vitiate Rule 23(b)(2).  Because the preclusive effect on which Kmart relies\ndoes not exist, Kmart’s argument fails.\nNumerous courts have held that a class action seeking only injunctive or declaratory\nrelief does not bar class members from bringing individual actions for damages.  This issue often\narises in actions challenging prison conditions.  For example, in Fortner v. Thomas, 983 F.2d\n1024, 1026 (11th Cir. 1993), several inmates brought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 seeking\nmonetary and injunctive relief for alleged constitutional violations.  The district court dismissed\nthe claims on the ground that they were barred because the claims had been litigated in a prior\nclass action in which only injunctive relief had been sought.  The Eleventh Circuit reversed,\nholding:\nIt is clear that a prisoner’s claim for monetary damages or other particularized\nrelief is not barred if the class representative sought only declaratory and\ninjunctive relief, even if the prisoner is a member of a pending class action . . .\nBecause the class representatives in [the prior class action] sought only injunctive\nrelief for the alleged unconstitutional conditions and practices of the Georgia\n-33-\n\nprison system, the district court erred in dismissing the appellants’ complaint\nwhich included a claim for monetary damages.\nId. at 1031.  Many other courts, including the Tenth Circuit, follow the rule that a class action\nseeking only injunctive or declaratory relief does not bar class members from bringing individual\ndamage claims.  See, e.g., McNeil v. Guthrie, 945 F.2d 1163, 1166 n.4 (10th Cir. 1991) (holding\nthat “class members may bring individual actions when they seek money damages.”).23\nThe single case cited by Kmart is not to the contrary.  First, unlike Title III of the ADA,\nwhich does not provide for damages, see § 12188, the class claim in Zachery was brought under\nTitle VI/I of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which does provide for damages.  See id., 185 F.R.D.\nat 237 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 1981a(a)(1)).  Second, the plaintiffs in Zachery had initially sought\ndamages on behalf of the class but later amended their complaint and their motion for class\ncertification to drop the damage claims.  Id. at 234.  Courts have recognized that once class\nrepresentatives assert a claim on behalf of a class, there is a possibility that dropping the claim\nmay prejudice class members.  See, e.g., In re Nazi Era Cases Against German Defendants\nLitig., 198 F.R.D. 429, 439 (D.N.J. 2000) (“Court approval of a dismissal pursuant to Rule 23(e)\n23 See also, e.g., Hiser v. Franklin, 94 F.3d 1287, 1291 (9th Cir. 1996) holding that\n(“‘every federal court of appeals that has considered the question has held that a class action\nseeking only declaratory or injunctive relief does not bar subsequent individual suits for\ndamages.’” (citation omitted)); Norris v. Slothouber, 718 F.2d 1116, 1117 (D.C. Cir. 1983)\n(holding that “[a] suit for damages is not precluded by reason of the plaintiff's membership in a\nclass for which no monetary relief is sought.”); Crowder v. Lash, 687 F.2d 996, 1009 (7th Cir.\n1982) (Applying rule and noting that “several circuits have held that where a prisoner seeks\ndamages for allegedly unconstitutional conditions of confinement he is not precluded by an\nearlier class action in which only declaratory and injunctive relief were sought.”); Bogard v.\nCook, 586 F.2d 399, 406-9 (5th Cir. 1978) (holding that individual claim for damages not barred\nby prior class action seeking equitable relief), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 883 (1979). \n-34-\n\nprevents the class action device from being used in an abusive manner . . . as it allows a court to\nensure that the representative plaintiffs have not settled or dismissed their claims to the prejudice\nof a prospective class prior to certification . . ..”).  As such, Zachery is distinguishable from the\npresent case and the overwhelming weight of precedent demonstrates that certifying this class\nwill not bar individual damage claims.  Kmart’s objection to certification on this ground should\nbe rejected.\nV. Certification Pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) is Appropriate. \nA. Named Plaintiffs’ Individual Damages Claims Are Irrelevant to Certification\nunder Rule 23(b)(2).\nClass certification under Rule 23(b)(2) is generally appropriate only where the class is\nnot asserting claims for damages or where such claims are incidental to the injunctive relief\nrequested.  See, e.g., Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition, 184 F.R.D. at 361-62.  Here, because\nthere is no damages claim asserted on behalf of the class, this issue should not arise.  Kmart\nargues that the fact that Named Plaintiffs are seeking damages for themselves may cause class\nmembers’ claims to be barred by res judicata.  Kmart is mistaken.  \nKmart bases its argument on Ticor Title Ins. Co. v. Brown, 511 U.S. 117 (1994).  The\nclass in Ticor originally sought both monetary and equitable relief but settled the case on terms\nthat dropped the monetary claims.  See Brown v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., 982 F.2d 386, 389 (9th Cir.\n-35-\n\n1992).  The court approved the settlement and certified the class under Rules 23(b)(1) and\n23(b)(2), but did not give absent class members the right to opt out.  Id.  Absent class members\nlater brought an action seeking monetary damages, and the district court dismissed the claims on\nthe ground that they were barred by res judicata as a result of the class action settlement.  Id. at\n390.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that, “because [the absent class members] had no\nopportunity to opt out . . . there would be a violation of minimal due process if [their] damage\nclaims were held barred by res judicata.”  Id. at 392.  The Supreme Court initially granted the\nwrit of certiorari but subsequently dismissed the writ as improvidently granted.  Ticor, 511 U.S.\nat 122.  In dictum, the Court made clear that the issue presented by Ticor concerned only\nwhether “absent class members have a constitutional due process right to opt out of any class\naction which asserts monetary claims on their behalf.”  Id. at 120-21 (emphasis added). \nNothing in Ticor implicates damage claims brought by Named Plaintiffs on their own\nbehalf but not that of the class.  The concern in Ticor -- that absent class members should have\nthe choice not to participate in a class action if they are going to be bound by a judgment in that\naction -- does not apply to monetary claims brought only by Named Plaintiffs, who by definition\nchose to bring the lawsuit.  Indeed courts routinely certify classes under Rule 23(b)(2) in actions\nin which the named plaintiffs seek damages only for themselves.  See, e.g., Daniels, 198 F.R.D.\nat 416;  Siddiqi, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19930 at *28 n.4. \nB. The Proposed Class Satisfies Rule 23(b)(2). \nA class is proper under Rule 23(b)(2) if the party opposing the class “acted or refused to\nact on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive\n-36-\n\nrelief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole . . ..”  Kmart’s\nattempt to show this provision inapplicable succeeds only in underscoring its applicability. \nKmart cites to five “Kmart policies of general applicability that affect Plaintiffs and the putative\nclass members . . ..”  (Class Opp. at 73.)  While Named Plaintiffs argue that there are far more\npolicies and policy failures that represent examples of Kmart acting and refusing to act on\ngrounds generally applicable to the class, Kmart’s acknowledgment of these five policies -- the\nadequacy of which Named Plaintiffs contest -- is certainly sufficient to support certification\nunder Rule 23(b)(2).  The other policies and policy failures alleged by Named Plaintiffs also\nsupport such certification.\nIndeed, as one court has recently held, the plaintiffs do not need to point to a specific\npolicy to support certification pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2).  In certifying a class of Deaf employees\nchallenging their employer’s policies and policy failures, the court in Bates v. United Parcel\nService, held that such a requirement:\nwould lead to the unacceptable conclusion that an employer could protect itself\nfrom any class action suit simply by failing to adopt specific policies.  That result\nseems particularly egregious in cases like this one, where plaintiffs claim that an\nemployer’s failure to adopt specific policies is the very reason that the employer\nis in violation of anti-discrimination laws.\nId., 2001 WL 1482023 at *7.  Named Plaintiffs challenge Kmart’s failure to promulgate specific\npolicies sufficient to prevent discriminatory barriers; as was the case in Bates, this is sufficient\nfor Rule 23(b)(2).  See also, e.g., Lightbourn, 118 F.3d at 426 (holding that “Rule 23(b)(2)\nclearly applies” to case alleging failure to ensure accessible polling places because the defendant\nhas “‘acted or refused to act’ on grounds generally applicable to the class.”); Daniels, 198 F.R.D.\n-37-\n\nat 414 (holding that certification pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) was “especially appropriate where a\nplaintiff seeks injunctive relief against discriminatory practices by a defendant”); Grijalva, 1995\nWL 523609 at *2 (holding that defendant’s failure to monitor Medicare HMOs and to implement\neffective appeals system “has affected the entire class,” making Rule 23(b)(2) appropriate).  \nVI. Named Plaintiffs’ Claims Are Best Tried as a Class Action.\nKmart argues throughout its brief that this case will require store-by-store analysis under\nvarying standards.  While these manageabilty issues are not technically part of the analysis of a\nRule 23(b)(2) class, compare Rule 23(b)(2) with Rule 23(b)(3)(D), it may be helpful to review\nthe factors that make this case not only manageable but ideal for class certification.  \nMuch of the discrimination alleged by Named Plaintiffs can be remedied at Kmart’s\nheadquarters.  Where Named Plaintiffs challenge policies or policy failures, those allegations can\nbe addressed by an analysis of Kmart’s company-wide policies and training.  Even where Kmart\nasserts that store-level information is necessary, the required information is generated and/or\ncollected by Kmart’s headquarters.  For example, although Kmart complains that an analysis of\nthe spacing of clothing racks will require a store-by-store analysis, it concedes that Kmart’s\nStore Planning department “creates a fixture floor plan for each store” and that this plan “is, in\nessence, a blue print of the entire interior of a Kmart store. . . . [including] the location of . . .\nvarious permanent and temporary fixtures . . ..”  (Declaration of Michael Francis in Opposition\nto Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification (“Francis Decl.”) ¶¶ 8-9 (emphasis in original).) \nShould this Court determine that the ADA requires more than 24 inches to provide access to\nclothing racks, it can order Kmart to adjust its company-wide minimum and to design new\n-38-\n\nlayouts at headquarters for distribution to its stores, fully in tune with Kmart’s existing\nprocedure.  \nKmart’s procedure for architectural compliance is also centralized at headquarters.  For\nexample, Kmart asserts that, should this Court certify the requested class, it “would have to\ncount the parking spaces to determine the accessible ratio at each store . . ..”  (Class Opp. at 2\n(emphasis in original).)  Documents turned over to Named Plaintiffs pursuant to their motion to\ncompel reveal that Kmart has already undertaken this task in at least 1,441 stores -- and that\napproximately 39% of them are out of compliance.  (See Second Robertson Decl. ¶ 17.)  Because\nADA compliance efforts have long been directed and coordinated by Kmart’s headquarters, (see,\ne.g., Declaration of Bruce Glasser in Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification\n(“Glasser Decl.”)  ¶¶ 4, 7, 11, 20, 27-33, 37, 47, 57-58, 62-64), that office should be well-\nprepared to manage any assessment or remedy required by this litigation.  \nFinally, with respect to architectural violations, Kmart asserts that the Court would have\nto evaluate the age and extent of renovations at each store to determine which standard to apply. \n(Class Opp. at 35-36.)  Kmart’s own submissions demonstrate, however, that a single standard\nwould govern all but a few stores.  The ADA requires facilities built after January 26, 1993 to\ncomply with the Standards.  § 12183(a)(1); 28 C.F.R. § 36.406(a).  This standard thus applies to\nthe 442 stores that Kmart states were built after January 26, 1993.  (See Class Opp. at 35 n.37.)\nIn addition, where part of a facility is altered, it, too, must comply with the Standards. \n§ 12183(a)(2); 28 C.F.R. § 36.406(a).  Kmart has admitted that its “High Frequency Refurb”\nprogram “involved changing the entire layout of most existing stores.”  (Francis Decl. ¶ 14; see\n-39-\n\nalso Glasser Decl. ¶ 53.)  As a result, at stores having undergone the High Frequency Refurb, the\nentire store must comply with the Standards.  Kmart states further that 1,858 Kmart stores -- that\nis, all but about 24 stores -- have undergone this refurbishment program.  (Glasser Decl. ¶ 54; see\nalso Francis Decl. ¶ 17; Francis Dep. at 47:19 - 48:16 (Rep. App. Tab 24).)  That is, all but about\n24 of Kmart’s 2,113 stores will be analyzed under a single set of standards:  The DOJ’s\nStandards for Accessible Design.  \nEven the application of a single standard to 2,100 stores may still leave the Court with\nthe task of assessing compliance of certain architectural features in each store with that standard.\nAs discussed above, some of this information may already be available from Kmart.  However,\nunder similar circumstances, this Court has seen fit to appoint a special master.  In Bridge\nPublications, Inc. v. F.A.C.T. Net, Inc., 183 F.R.D. 254 (D. Colo. 1998), this Court faced the\ntask of determining the validity of the copyright of 1,914 works.  Id. at 256.  It appointed a\nspecial master to prepare findings on the validity of each, which findings could then be\nchallenged by either party.  Id. at 264.  \nThe alternative to class treatment here is 2,113 separate trials in various districts around\nthe country.  This procedure contains the potential to set very different standards for Kmart’s\ncentralized policies; that is, Kmart may ultimately have to issue separate policies for each store\nfollowing entry of judgment against that store.  \nVII. Named Plaintiffs Have Standing to Bring this Action and to Represent the Class.\nKmart argues that Named Plaintiffs lack standing to bring this action both because they\nhave not visited all of its 2,113 stores and because they do not provide evidence of an imminent\n-40-\n\nplan to visit all 2,113 stores in the near future.  Neither is required.  Rather, because Named\nPlaintiffs have standing to challenge all of the practices at issue here, they have standing both to\nbring this action and to act as a class representative.  \nA. Named Plaintiffs Are Not Required to Visit or Plan to Visit All 2,113 Kmart\nStores. \nNamed Plaintiffs must have standing in order to represent the class.  This simply means\nthat they “must have personally sustained or be in immediate danger of sustaining ‘some direct\ninjury as a result of the challenged . . . conduct.’” Armstrong v. Davis, No. 00-15132, --- F.3d ---\n, 2001 WL 1506518 at *6 (9th Cir. Nov. 28, 2001) (quoting O’Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488,\n494 (1974) (ellipses supplied)).  It does not mean that they must have standing to bring each\nclass member’s claim as to each store in the country.  Indeed, Kmart’s argument represents a\nfundamental misunderstanding of the class action mechanism.  “Class actions are representative\nsuits on behalf of groups of persons similarly situated.  [The class action] is a nontraditional\nlitigation procedure that permits a representative with typical claims to sue or defend on behalf\nof, and stand in judgment for, a class ‘when the question is of common or general interest to . . . \npersons  . . . so numerous as to make it impracticable to bring them all before the court. . .’”  1\nNewberg § 1.01 at 1-2 - 1-3 (quoting Equity Rule 38, 33 Sup. Ct. xxix (1912)).  In other words,\nalthough it is hornbook standing law that one person cannot bring a claim on behalf of another,\nsee, e.g., Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499 (1975), class actions permit one person -- the\nnamed or representative plaintiff -- to bring claims on behalf of numerous others not party to the\ncase.  The prerequisites of Rule 23 serve to ensure that -- once a representative plaintiff has\n-41-\n\nestablished his own standing -- he can represent the interests of others.  1 Newberg  § 2.06 at 2-\n29 - 31; see also 7B Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure § 1785.1 (2d ed.\n1986 & Supp. 2001) (“As long as the representative parties have a direct and substantial interest,\nthey have standing; the question whether they may be allowed to present claims on behalf of\nothers who have similar, but not identical, interests depends not on standing, but on an\nassessment of typicality and adequacy of representation”).  As explained below, Named\nPlaintiffs have standing to challenge Kmart’s discriminatory barriers and policies based on the\ninjuries they have suffered and their intent to continue to shop at Kmart; as explained above and\nin Named Plaintiffs’ Class Memorandum, they satisfy Rule 23(a) and (b)(2) with respect to those\nclaims.  Named Plaintiffs thus have standing to challenge Kmart’s policies and practices on\nbehalf of a class of individuals who have been injured by them in all of Kmart’s stores around\nthe country.  \nPerhaps because of its fundamental misunderstanding of the mechanics of a class action,\nalmost none of the cases on which Kmart relies in its standing argument arose in the context of a\nclass action.  Indeed, in one of the cases on which it relies -- which held that an individual did\nnot have standing to challenge ADA violations at lottery retailers he had not visited -- the court\nspecifically noted, “Plaintiff is not bringing this case as a class action.  Although he\nunquestionably hopes that this action will aid other disabled persons, he is asking for relief as an\nindividual.”  Tyler v. Kan. Lottery, 14 F. Supp. 2d 1220, 1224-25 (D. Kan. 1998); see also\nMoose Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis, 407 U.S. 163, 166-67 (1972) (holding individual African-\nAmerican lacked standing to challenge membership policies of all-white club because he had not\n-42-\n\napplied for membership); Citizens Concerned About Our Children v. Sch. Bd., 193 F.3d 1285,\n1290 (11th Cir. 1999) (holding two individual students lacked standing to challenge\ndiscrimination at schools they did not attend).24  Kmart relies on the rejection of the individual\nclaims in Citizens Concerned and Tyler for the proposition that “[a] civil rights claim relating\nonly to one facility, or even a handful of facilities operated by the same defendant, does not\nconfer standing to seek sweeping injunctive relief with respect to all of the defendant’s\nfacilities,” (Class Opp. at 41), but ignores the many civil rights class actions challenging\nconditions at multiple facilities.  (See cases cited supra n.20.)\n24 See also Shotz v Cates, 256 F.3d 1077, 1082 (11th Cir. 2001) (holding that\nindividual disabled plaintiffs did not have standing to challenge barriers in courthouse because\npast visits to courthouse did not indicate an immediate and real threat of future discrimination);\nSteger v Franco, 228 F.3d 889, 892-93 (8th Cir. 2000) (holding individual disabled plaintiffs\nwho offered no evidence of their intent to visit defendant’s office building in the future lacked\nstanding to seek injunctive relief requiring defendant to bring building into compliance with the\nADA); Jairath v. Dyer, 154 F.3d 1280, 1283 (11th Cir. 1998) (holding individual HIV positive\nplaintiff lacked standing to seek injunctive relief against a doctor from whom he was not likely\nto seek treatment again); Access Now, Inc. v. S. Fla. Stadium Corp., 161 F. Supp. 2d 1357, 1365\n(S.D. Fla. 2001) (holding individual plaintiff did not have standing to bring claims “about which\nhe lacked actual knowledge, pursuant either to his personal encounter with those violations or by\nexpert testimony, when the Complaint was filed.”); Deck v. Am. Haw. Cruises, Inc., 121 F.\nSupp. 2d 1292, 1299 (D. Haw. 2000) (holding individual plaintiff who stated only that she\nintended in the future to “look into taking” additional cruises lacked standing to seek injunctive\nrelief pursuant to the ADA against defendant cruise line); Delil v. El Torito Restaurants, Inc.,\nNo. 94-3900, 1997 WL 714866 at *3-4 (N.D. Cal. June 24, 1997) (Mintz Decl. Ex. 4) (holding\nindividual plaintiff who resided over 100 miles away from a restaurant to which she was\nallegedly denied access in violation of the ADA, was unlikely to visit the restaurant again, and\ntherefore, did not have standing to seek injunctive relief compelling its alteration); Aikens v. St.\nHelena Hosp. 843 F. Supp. 1329, 1333-34 (N.D. Cal. 1994) (holding that individual hearing-\nimpaired plaintiff who was denied a sign language interpreter during an emergency hospital visit\nhad no standing to seek injunctive relief because she failed to show either that she was likely to\nuse the hospital in the near future or that, if she did so, the hospital would again fail to provide an\ninterpreter).\n-43-\n\nOne of the only class cases cited by Kmart underscores Named Plaintiffs’ standing to\nchallenge Kmart’s conduct at all of its stores.  The plaintiffs in Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991\n(1982) (cited in Class Opp. at 40), represented a class of nursing home residents challenging\ndecisions to transfer them without notice or hearing.  Id. at 993.  The named plaintiffs had been\ntransferred to facilities offering lower levels of care, but had not been threatened with any other\ntype of transfer, so they did not have standing to represent individuals who were threatened with\nsuch other transfers.  Id. at 995, 999.  This did not stop the named plaintiffs -- residents of a\nsingle nursing home -- from representing a class that encompassed “Medicaid-eligible residents\nof New York nursing homes,” id. at 995-96, that is, facilities other than the one in which they\nresided.\nB. Named Plaintiffs Have Standing to Challenge Kmart’s Discriminatory\nPractices.\nThe Steger case -- on which Kmart relies -- demonstrates that Named Plaintiffs have\nstanding under Title III of the ADA.  One of the plaintiffs, a vision-impaired individual, had\nbeen injured by the lack of Braille signage in the first floor men’s room of the defendant’s\nbuilding.  On that basis, he sought to challenge all ADA violations anywhere in the building. \nThe Eighth Circuit made two separate holdings:  (1) that this plaintiff did not have standing to\nchallenge violations that did not affect him as a vision-impaired person; but (2) that he did have\nstanding to challenge all vision-related violations throughout the building, regardless of whether\nhe had encountered them or not.  Id., 228 F.3d at 893-94.  Kmart, in its Class Opposition, relies\non the separate opinion of Judge Loken -- concurring in part and dissenting in part -- for a\n-44-\n\nproposition that was rejected by the majority.  (See Class Opp. at 42 (“proper standing must be\nlimited even more specifically to those areas of a public accommodation that Plaintiffs have\nvisited.”).)  The majority’s holding on this point provides support for Named Plaintiffs’ standing\nto challenge all mobility-related barriers at Kmart stores, even if they have not personally\nencountered each one.\nLewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343 (1996), also relied on by Kmart, is in accord with the first\nof Steger’s holdings:  That a plaintiff cannot challenge policies that do not affect him.  In that\ncase, a class of prisoners alleged that they were being denied access to the courts.  The district\ncourt found actual injury on the part of only one named plaintiff:  Failure to provide the services\nhe required in light of the fact that he was illiterate.  Id. at 358.  On that basis, the Court held that\nthe district court could not order relief as to prisoners whose injuries stemmed from different\nsources:  the fact that they did not speak English or were in lockdown.  Id.  The sentence for\nwhich Kmart cites Lewis in fact supports Named Plaintiffs’ standing here:   “The remedy must\n . . . be limited to the inadequacy that produced the injury in fact that the plaintiff has\nestablished.”  Id. at 357 (quoted in Class Opp. at 42.)  Named Plaintiffs challenge the\ninadequacies in Kmart policies and practices that “produced the injur[ies] in fact” that they have\nsuffered, that is, those policies and practices that cause barriers to individuals with mobility\nimpairments.25 \n25 Access Now, Inc. v. S. Fla. Stadium Corp., 161 F. Supp. 2d 1357 (S. D. Fla.\n2001), submitted by Kmart in its Second Legal Supplement to Defendant Kmart Corporation’s\nMemorandum in Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification, is not to the contrary,\nas the plaintiff in that case was challenging specific physical barriers rather than policies and\n(continued...)\n-45-\n\nKmart also asserts that Named Plaintiffs have not shown imminent future injury through\nplans either “to visit the well over 2100 Kmart stores they have never visited across the United\nStates,” or even to visit the stores they have visited in the past.  (Class Opp. at 43.)  As discussed\nabove, it is not their burden to show that they have standing with respect to each store;\naccordingly, they are under no obligation to manifest plans to take a 2100-store tour in the near\nfuture.  All three Named Plaintiffs shop at Kmart stores regularly, and all intend to continue to\ndo so in the future.  (Second Lucas Decl. ¶ 3; Second Lane Decl. ¶ 2; Second Reiskin Decl. ¶ 2\n(Rep. App. Tabs 10-12).)  This is sufficient to confer standing.  See, e.g., Access 123, Inc. v.\nMarkey’s Lobster Pool, Inc., No. 00-382-JD, 2001 WL 920051 at *3 (D.N.H. 2001) (Rep. App.\nTab 15) (holding one visit to restaurant coupled with intent to visit area restaurants in future and\ndefendant’s lack of intent to remedy barriers sufficient to confer standing); Association For\nDisabled Americans v. Claypool Holdings, LLC, 2001 WL 1112109 at *20-21 (S.D. Ind. Aug. 6,\n2001) (Rep. App. Tab 17) (holding that desire to stay in hotel in city in which plaintiff had\nfamily and to which he had traveled regularly in the past was sufficient to confer standing); Parr\nv. L & L Drive-Inn Restaurant, 96 F. Supp. 2d 1065, 1079 (D. Haw. 2000) (holding that one visit\nto a fast food restaurant coupled with the fact that the plaintiff had “developed a taste for [the\ndefendant’s] food and [had] visited various [of the defendant’s other] restaurants” was sufficient\nto confer standing, especially in light of the fact that “[v]isiting a fast food restaurant, as opposed\n25(...continued)\npractices.  The court’s holding -- that the plaintiff was limited to challenging barriers he had\nexperienced or of which he had notice, id. at 1365 -- supports the claims of Named Plaintiffs,\nwho seek to change policies and practices they have encountered and of which they have notice.  \n-46-\n\nto a hotel or professional office, is not the sort of event that requires advance planning or the\nneed for a reservation”).26\nBecause Named Plaintiffs have standing to challenge Kmart policies and practices that\naffect their disability -- mobility impairment -- and because they satisfy Rule 23 with respect to\ntheir challenge to those policies and practices, they have standing to represent the class.  \nVIII. Kmart’s Arguments to the Merits are Unavailing.\nIn its Class Opposition, Kmart made a number of assertions concerning the compliance\nof Kmart stores with the ADA and other merit-related questions.  Although resolution of these\nissues is inappropriate at this stage, see Cook v. Rockwell Int’l Corp., 151 F.R.D. 378, 381 (D.\nColo. 1993), Named Plaintiffs address them briefly below. \nA. Kmart’s “ADA Experts,” to the Extent They Provide Relevant Information,\nSupport Named Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification. \nKmart retained the firms of Ican, Inc. (“Ican”) and Tucker, Spearman & Associates\n(“Tucker”) to perform surveys of 50 Kmart stores that Kmart asserts were randomly selected. \n(Class Opp. at 21 & n.20.)   Ican’s founder, Heidi L. Van Arnem, and Tucker’s president, Joyce\nE. Tucker, submitted the signed Joint Report of Heidi L. Van Arnem & Joyce E. Tucker (“Joint\n26 These contrast with the cases cited by Kmart, in which the plaintiffs had not\nprovided evidence that they had plans to patronize the defendants’ facilities in the future.  See\ncases cited supra n. 24.  \n-47-\n\nReport”),27 on which Kmart relies for its assertion that the stores surveyed “were generally\naccessible to wheelchair and scooter users” and that any barriers they found “were temporary\nand isolated.” (Class Opp. at 21.)28  As explained below, this report (1) was drafted by Kmart’s\nattorneys, (2) relies on data gathered by entities that were paid $200,000 for a little over one\nmonth’s work, at least one of which has been sponsored by Kmart in the past, and neither of\nwhich had prior experience assessing facilities for compliance with the ADA, (3) is\nmethodologically flawed and largely does not address the barriers at issue in this case, and\n(4) contains conclusions that are contradicted by the data on which they purport to rely.  \nKmart’s attorneys played a major role in the Ican/Tucker survey.  Surveyors received no\nformal training; the only “training” consisted of a pre-survey tour of one store by Kmart’s lead\ncounsel, Walter Connolly, Ican’s Vice President of Inspiration, Kenny Rudolph, surveyors\nHeather Ashare and Patti Waxweiller, and Laurie Muhn, the star of the videotape discussed\nbelow.  (Rudolph Dep. at 46:4 - 46:24; see also Ashare Dep. at 9:1 - 9:7; Waxweiller Dep. at 9:9\n- 9:13 (Rep. App. Tabs 4-6).)  Kmart’s attorneys drafted the survey form.  (Rudolph Dep. at\n55:10 - 55:20 & Ex. 24.)  After each survey, one member of the team would type up a summary\n27 Sadly, not long after the submission of her declaration and Joint Report, Ms. Van\nArnem fell critically ill.  She passed away on November 11, 2001.  As such, Named Plaintiffs\ndid not have the opportunity to depose her.  Named Plaintiffs do not challenge Kmart’s reliance\non her declaration or the Joint Report in this context and accepted a deposition of Kenny\nRudolph in her place.  Based both on Ms. Van Arnem’s unavailability and on the deficiencies in\nthe Joint Report, Named Plaintiffs reserve the right to move to strike should Kmart attempt to\nuse the report in an adjudication of the merits.  \n28 Kmart also relies on the Joint Report and the Ican/Tucker surveys for the\nproposition that Kmart stores vary physically.  Class Opp. at 21.  As explained above, Named\nPlaintiffs do not contest this.    \n-48-\n\nwhich would be forwarded not to Ms. Van Arnem, but to Mr. Connolly.  (Ashare Dep. at 27:1 -\n27:12, 36:21 - 37:16. )  Ultimately, Foley & Lardner drafted the Joint Report itself.  (Rudolph\nDep. at 60:10 - 60:21 & Ex. 26.)\nAlthough Kmart labels Ican and Tucker “ADA Experts,” (see Class Opp. at 21), Ican had\nnot previously assessed a physical facility for compliance with the ADA, (Rudolph Dep. at 24:15\n- 24:23), and the Tucker firm’s background is entirely in employment rather than public\naccommodations compliance.  (See Declaration of Joyce E. Tucker in Opposition to Plaintiffs’\nMotion for Class Certification ¶¶ 4-31; Joint Report ¶¶ 10-16.)  Furthermore, Ican regards Kmart\nas its “business partner.”  (Rudolph Dep. at 15:17 - 15:18.)  Kmart began sponsoring Ican in the\nsummer of 2000, when it paid $10,000 to be an official sponsor of an Ican event, and Kmart’s\nlogo remains on Ican’s brochure.  (Id. at 61:12 - 63:18 and Ex. 27.)  Mr. Rudolph saw the survey\nproject -- one of the biggest Ican has had -- as “part of an ongoing and growing relationship\nbetween Ican and Kmart.”  (Id. at 26:14 - 27:5, 33:3 - 33:4.)  This bias is best summed up in the\nemail that Mr. Rudolph used to forward the draft Joint Report from Foley & Lardner to Ms. Van\nArnem, in which he enthused, “Let’s keep the Kmart partnership (and revenue stream!)\ngrowing!”  (Id. Ex. 26.)  Kmart paid Ican $100,000 for the survey, which appears to have\noccurred between early July of this year and the submission of Kmart’s opposition on August 9,\n2001.  (See Rudolph Dep. at 26:1 - 26:24, 30:16 - 31:15, 47:17 - 48:9 & Ex. 23.)  This is in\naddition to another $100,000 that was paid to Tucker for its role in the project.  (See Second\nRobertson Decl. Ex. 18.)\n-49-\n\nMethodologically, the survey was flawed.  First, individual store managers knew in\nadvance that their stores would be surveyed, and knew the survey was being conducted while\nsurveyors were in their stores (see Ashare Dep. at 14:9 - 14:14, 16:3 - 16:10; Rudolph Dep. Ex.\n25), leaving them free to clean up or rearrange the stores to attempt to ensure good results.  \nSecond, although Ican originally prepared a proposal that called for teams of two\nsurveyors, one of whom would be “a person with a disability that requires the use of a\nwheelchair,” (Rudolph Dep. 30:16 - 30:25; Ex. 21 at 2), in the end, none of the surveyors were\nindividuals who used wheelchairs.  (Id. at 25:21 - 25:25.)  This led to bizarre survey methods, for\nexample, non-disabled surveyors used shopping carts to test wheelchair access around aisle\ndisplays, to merchandise behind such displays, and to clothing racks.  (See Waxweiller Dep. at\n12:21 - 13:9; Ashare Dep. at 19:8 - 20:7 & Ex. 32 at 4 (“Can a shopping cart be pushed between\nall clothing and accessory racks?”) (emphasis in original)).29  Thus, because Kmart shopping\ncarts have a standardized width of 24 inches30 -- much narrower than most wheelchairs (see\n29 On re-direct examination by Kmart’s attorney, both surveyors asserted that they\nhad also measured the distances between clothing racks with a tape measure.  See Ashare Dep. at\n37:22 - 38:5; Waxweiller Dep. at 23:9 - 24:3.  Ms. Ashare stated that if these measurements were\nrecorded, they would have been recorded in her notes.  Ashare Dep. at 37:22 - 38:5.  The\nsurveyors’ notes provide such measurements in only eight stores, only one of which indicates a\nmeasure of 36 inches and several of which are less than 24\".  See Second Miot Decl. ¶ 4 (Rep.\nApp. Tab 8).  Ms. Waxweiller said she measured between racks, but did not always record these\nmeasurements and ultimately used the standard on the form:  what percentage she could get a\nshopping cart through.  Waxweiller Dep. at 14:11 - 15:3.  \n30 Ms. Ashare testified that Kmart shopping carts a standardized width, although she\ncould not recall what that width was.  Ashare Dep. at 25:22 - 26:13.  Named Plaintiffs had this\nstandardized width measured:  At six Denver-area Kmarts, shopping carts measured, at their\nwidest point, 24 inches.  Bell Decl. ¶¶ 2-3 (Rep. App. Tab 9). \n-50-\n\nClass Mem. at 20) -- the Ican/Tucker survey neither asked nor proved anything relevant about\nthe accessibility of clothing racks or merchandise behind displays.\nNor did the Ican/Tucker survey measure many of the discriminatory barriers at issue in\nthis case.  For example:\n! Guidelines for the survey describe certain barriers as “temporary-operational,”\nincluding, for example, “an accessible cash register that is closed, or a stocking\ncart in the middle of an aisle with no worker nearby,” (Ashare Dep. Ex. 30),31 and\nthe survey form, accordingly, has no place to record these types of obstructions. \n(Id. Ex. 32.)  But Named Plaintiffs and putative class members frequently are\ndenied access by these types of obstructions.  (See App. Revised Tabs 7 & 8.)\n! The survey form does not attempt to record the accessibility of the main aisles,\nalthough Named Plaintiffs and putative class members often encounter barriers in\nthese aisles.  (See id.)\n! The only survey question concerning non-main aisles relates only to “promotional\ndisplays,” ignoring other types of obstructions.  (Ashare Dep. Ex. 32 at 4.)  Again,\nNamed Plaintiffs and putative class members often encounter other types of\nbarriers in these aisles.  (See App. Revised Tabs 7 & 8.)\nAlthough there is no provision for such barriers in the survey form, surveyors’\nhandwritten notes provide a glimpse of the “temporary” barriers they were apparently instructed\nto ignore.  For example, one surveyor noted, “Temporary obstructions throughout store\n(abandoned shopping carts, merchandise, ladders).”  (Second Miot Decl. Ex. 2 at I/T0226.) \nAnother noted, “Temporary issues within health & beauty dept. & home electronics prevented\naccess to all aisles. - boxes, ladders.  Numerous (temporary) obstructions (ladders, boxes, carts\nfull of merchandise) etc. prevented access to aisles in pantry, sporting goods, do it yourself,\n31 Ms. Ashare testified that these guidelines were communicated to other surveyors\nand “guided the survey process.”  Ashare Dep. at 13:6 - 13:15.  \n-51-\n\ndepartments.  Lawn chairs in furniture department were in the middle of aisles preventing . . . .” \n(Id. Ex. 3 at I/T0345 (the remainder of this note was cut off in the copy provided to Named\nPlaintiffs).)  Another responded “yes” to the survey questions whether a person using a\nwheelchair could get around and have access to merchandise behind promotional displays, but\nadded, “A number of temp. obstructions (e.g., inventory, carts, etc.) existed.”  (Id., Ex. 7 at\nIT296; see also id. ¶ 5 and Exs. 2-4, 6-8, 10-12, 14-15.)  These “temporary” barriers are\nprecisely those that Named Plaintiffs argue violate the ADA.  \nFinally, the Joint Report makes several assertions that are simply false.  It asserts that\n“[a]ll main aisles were accessible.”  (Joint Report ¶ 24.)  There was, however, no provision in the\nsurvey form for the Ican/Tucker surveyors to state whether the main aisles were or were not\naccessible.  The part of the survey form to be filled out by the store manager contains the\nquestion whether “seasonal, sale or other promotional displays ever encroach main walkways.” \n(See Ashare Dep. Ex. 32 at 2.)  It is thus possible that the assertion concerning the accessibility\nof main aisles is based on the self-reporting of Kmart management.  Yet this is contradicted by\nthe Ican/Tucker surveyors:  Even in the absence of a relevant question, several surveyors noted\nobstructions in the main aisles.  (See Second Miot Decl. ¶ 7 and Exs. 6, 14-16.)  The Joint Report\nalso states,“There were no obstructions observed that would prevent a person in a wheelchair\nfrom accessing merchandise on shelves or racks located behind the displays.”  Id. ¶¶ 32.  Yet in\n21% of the stores that had such displays, the Ican/Tucker surveyors answered “no” to the\nquestion “Can a person in a wheelchair get to merchandise in back of the displays?”  (See\nSecond Robertson Decl. Ex. 4.)  \n-52-\n\nMany of the other survey questions and accompanying notes -- far from supporting the\nassertion that Kmart stores “were generally accessible to wheelchair and scooter users” -- reveal\nthe presence of significant barriers.  Kmart’s experts never entered the information in the survey\nforms into a spreadsheet or otherwise analyzed it quantitatively.  (See Rudolph Dep. at 57:25 -\n58:3.)  Named Plaintiffs did so and noted the following:  35% of the stores at which merchandise\nwas displayed outside did not maintain a 36-inch path through that merchandise, approximately\n30% of both the men’s and women’s accessible fitting rooms did not have a bench, and\napproximately one-quarter of each had obstructions in the area surrounding the entrance to the\nfitting rooms.  (See Second Robertson ¶¶ 19-20 and Ex. 4.)  Two-thirds of the stores surveyed\nhad promotional displays in the non-main aisles, a condition that often results in a barrier to\ncustomers using wheelchairs or scooters, and even the non-disabled Ican/Tucker surveyors --\nusing shopping carts that are narrower than wheelchairs -- stated that, in 24% of the stores with\nsuch displays, customers in wheelchairs could not get around the displays and in 21%, such\ncustomers could not get to merchandise in back of the displays.  (Id.)  Thirty percent of the\nparking lots were out of compliance.  (Id. ¶¶ 21-23 and Ex. 5.)  These figures reflect only the\ninformation entered in the survey form.  A review of the surveyors’ notes and summaries reveals\nmore detail concerning barriers and obstructions at the Kmart stores they surveyed.  (See Second\nMiot Decl. ¶¶ 5-7 and references cited therein.)\nKmart also relies on a videotape showing a single, non-disabled Ican employee, Laurie\nMuhn, in a single store on a single day for the assertion that Tucker and Ican “noted that a\nnumber of the statements in declarations submitted by Plaintiffs did not accurately reflect the\n-53-\n\nstate of the stores in question.”  (Class Opp. at 21-22 (citing Muhn Decl. ¶¶ 14-70 & Ex. 2).) \nPutting aside the predictable differences between Ms. Muhn’s experience and that of real Kmart\nshoppers with real disabilities, (see Second Lucas Decl. at ¶¶ 4-41 and Exs. 1-11), and despite\nthe use of the plurals “declarations” and “stores,” this assertion is based on a direct comparison\nof apples to oranges:  Kmart documents demonstrate that the single store in the single\ndeclaration in question -- store number 7589 in Utica, Michigan addressed in the Declaration of\nDuane Cook -- was undergoing a significant remodeling at the time Ms. Muhn’s videotape was\nbeing recorded, providing different conditions from those encountered by Mr. Cook.  (See\nSecond Robertson Decl. ¶¶ 26-27 and Exs. 19-20.)  Indeed, Ms. Muhn concedes as much during\nthe videotape.  (See Second Miot Decl., Ex. 1 at 3-4, 10 (transcript of Muhn videotape).)  That\nMs. Muhn and her videographer did not encounter the same barriers Mr. Cook repeatedly\nencountered when he shopped at the Utica store, (see Declaration of Duane Cook at ¶¶ 5-1532),\ndoes not rebut Mr. Cook’s experiences or the appropriateness of class certification.  See supra\nSection I.E.  \nB. Kmart’s Stores Are Not “Virtually Entirely Accessible and ADA\nCompliant.”\n32 The Declaration of Duane Cook can be found in Tab 8 of the original version of\nthe Appendix to Plaintiffs’ Memorandum in Support of Motion for Class Certification.  It is\ninteresting to note that, after making an enormous effort to ensure that Named Plaintiffs relied\nonly on testimony from witnesses who had been deposed rather than on the declarations Named\nPlaintiffs had originally submitted, see Defendant’s Motion to Defer Deadline for Opposition to\nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification at 12 (filed June 26, 2001), Kmart elected to attack the\ndeclaration of a witness who had not been deposed and whose testimony, at Kmart’s request,\nNamed Plaintiffs did not rely on in their Class Memorandum.\n-54-\n\nKmart repeatedly argues that its stores are already in compliance with the ADA.  This is\nthe heart of the merits of this lawsuit, and particularly inappropriate for resolution at this stage. \nSee Bates, 2001 WL 1482023 at *2-3  (holding that the defendant’s arguments that it was in\ncompliance with the ADA were inappropriate to consider on motion for class certification). \nKmart’ s own evidence, however, demonstrates that these assertions are wrong.  As pointed out\nabove, the Ican/Tucker surveys and Kmart’s mystery shopper reports showed significant levels\nof non-compliance.  See supra at 20-21, 53-54.  Kmart’s own 2000 ADA Surveys also show -- in\ntwo easily quantifiable examples -- that approximately 39% of the parking lots surveyed and\napproximately 46% of the fitting rooms surveyed were out of compliance.  (See Second\nRobertson Decl. ¶¶ 5-18 and Ex. 2-3.)  \nC. Kmart’s Attempts to Explain Away the Barriers at Its Stores Are\nUnavailing.\nIn its Class Opposition, Kmart addresses each of the categories of barrier complained of\nby Named Plaintiffs and attempts to either justify it or explain it away.  These attempts all fail. \nAisle stacks.  Named Plaintiffs have demonstrated that Kmart’s policies mandate placing\nmerchandise displays in aisles, a condition that commonly obstructs customers in wheelchairs\nfrom accessing the merchandise behind the displays.  (See Class Mem. at 18-19.)  Kmart’s\nresponse is that it “expressly advises that these stacks are to be placed and angled so as not to\nimpede access to any merchandise and used only where there is sufficient space.”  (Class Opp. at\n26.)  Kmart’s only support for this express advice, however, is the declaration of a Regional Vice\nPresident stating that “[a]isle and floor stacks are to be placed to still allow access and clearance\n-55-\n\nfor customers and shopping carts in and out of the aisle and to all merchandise.”  (Declaration of\nRobert D. Frame in Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Class Certification (“Frame Decl.”)\n¶ 63.)  Kmart provides no evidence that it instructs its stores to ensure that merchandise behind\nthese displays is accessible, much less that such instruction is effective.  As pointed out above,\neven Kmart’s experts found a significant level of blockage by merchandise displays.  (See supra\nat 53-54; Second Robertson Decl. Ex. 4.)\nRack Spacing.  Named Plaintiffs have provided evidence that Kmart permits as little as\n24 inches between clothing racks.  (See Class Mem. at 20.)  Kmart argues that “the ADA has\nvery limited, if any, applicability to the spacing of movable clothing racks . . ..”  (Class Opp. at\n26.)  The authorities on which Kmart relies addressed the interpretation of a single section of the\nStandards -- § 4.1.3(12)(b) -- and concluded it does not apply to moveable fixtures, so that such\nfixtures need only be accessible if it is “readily achievable” to do so under § 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv). \nNamed Plaintiffs disagree with this interpretation.  Among other things, § 4.1.3(12)(b) does not\ncontain the limitation to “fixed or built-in” units that § 4.1.3(12)(a) does, indicating that it is not\nso limited.  In any event, neither of Kmart’s authorities addressed the separate question whether\nKmart is required, pursuant to § 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii), to modify its policy, practice or procedure of\nsetting the racks too close in order to make its goods available to customers with disabilities.  \nKmart also asserts that Named Plaintiffs have not shown that this 24-inch minimum “has\na uniform effect upon the accessibility of Kmart stores.”  (Class Opp. at 27.)  The fact that a\ndiscriminatory policy is, at times, disregarded does not legitimize it.  If a company permitted, but\ndid not require, its managers to fire employees based on the fact that they were African-\n-56-\n\nAmerican, the fact that some African-Americans remained employed by the company would not\nmake the policy legal.  Named Plaintiffs properly challenge a Kmart policy that explicitly\npermits discrimination to occur.  \nObstructed Aisles.  Kmart asserts that obstructed aisles encountered by Customer\nWitnesses are “temporary and fleeting.”  (Class Opp at 24.)  As explained above, this is not a\ndefense unless the interruption in access is “due to maintenance or repairs,” see 28 C.F.R.\n36.211(b), and is, in any event, unavailing in the face of Kmart’s utter failure to “ensure that\naccessible routes are properly maintained and free of obstructions.”  (See Preamble at 638.)  This\nassertion is also belied by over 19,000 mystery shopper records reporting obstructions, many of\nthem in merchandise aisles.  (See Fox Decl. Ex. 2.)\nAccessible Checkouts.  With respect to Named Plaintiffs’ evidence that Kmart often fails\nto keep an accessible checkout aisle open, Kmart appears to argue it is not obligated to ensure\nthat such aisles are open, but rather that disabled shoppers should be content to wait for an\nemployee to open an accessible aisle, or to checkout from the opposite end of the checkout lane,\nwith all of the inconvenience this entails.  (See Class Opp. at 29-30; see also Donn Dep. at 9:24 -\n11:10 (testifying that he was forced to go around to opposite end of checkout aisle and lost his\nplace in line); 14:23 - 16:1 (testifying that he was instructed to use regular checkout aisle when\naccessible checkout aisle was closed); Madden Dep. at 26:12 - 27:19 (testifying that customers\nbecame obstinate at having to back up to let him go around checkout); Bach Dep. at 20:6 - 21:4\n(testifying that she was forced to go around or have 15-year old daughter check out for her);\nWillenburg Dep. at 26:14 - 27:22 (testifying that cashier told her “she couldn’t justify opening\n-57-\n\nup a handicap register for just one handicap person . . ..”) (All deposition excerpts are included\nin Revised Tab 8 to Class. Mem.)  \nThis is stark contrast to the intense focus Kmart places on ensuring that its non-disabled\ncustomers check out quickly.  (See, e.g., Declaration of Roberta Kaselitz in Opposition to\nPlaintiff’s Motion for Class Certification Ex. 4 (Kmart’s Customer Service Map, requiring\n“Quick & Accurate Checkouts . . . Keep checkouts moving”); Second Robertson Decl. Ex. 24 at\n1 (Kmart’s Bulletin FTE #8: “3 In a Line Checkout Commitment,” stating that, “[t]he service\nprovided to our customers at our checkouts and service desk must be fast and friendly.  Our goal\nis to never have more than three customers in a line at our checkouts or service desk.”)\n(emphasis in original).) This contrast constitutes discrimination in the “full and equal\nenjoyment” of Kmart’s goods and services in violation of § 12182(a).  While some measure of\ndelay may be acceptable on a single occasion, see Anderson v. Ross Stores, 2000 WL 1585269\nat * 10 -- and is likely experienced even by non-disabled patrons from time to time -- it is not\nacceptable as standard operating procedure in response to multiple violations where speed is a\nstated corporate goal.  See also Cupolo, 5 F. Supp. 2d at 1083-84 (holding that prompt repair and\nreasonable accommodations are not defenses to violations of the ADA). \nFitting Rooms, Restrooms and Counter Heights.  Kmart’s response to Named Plaintiffs’\nevidence of inaccessible fitting rooms and restrooms and unusably high service counters is\nsimply to assert that this evidence is insufficient.  Kmart goes so far as to assert that Named\nPlaintiffs have provided no evidence that Kmart’s restrooms are inaccessible.  (See Class Opp. at\n23 n. 24.)  This is incorrect.  (See Class Mem. at 7 n. 20.)  Indeed, with respect to each of these\n-58-\n\nfeatures, Named Plaintiffs provided evidence of repeated violations, which evidence is\nsubstantiated by Kmart’s own experts. (See supra at 53-54; Second Robertson Decl. Ex. 4\n(Ican/Tucker surveys also show:  20% of the customer service counters were higher than\nrequired with no flip-up shelf; 27% of men’s fitting rooms and 24% of women’s had obstructions\nin the area surrounding the entrance; 30% of both lacked required benches; 33% of men’s\nrestrooms and 38% of women’s had doors that were or “seem[ed]” too heavy).)  \nParking.  In response to the repeated barriers Named Plaintiffs and putative class\nmembers have encountered parking at Kmart stores, Kmart relies on Thompson v. Colorado, 29\nF. Supp. 2d 1226, (D. Colo. 1997), vacated on other grounds, 258 F.3d 1241 (10th Cir. 2001), a\ncase addressing the legality, under Title II of the ADA, of a state’s imposition of a fee for a\ndisabled parking placard.  The section cited by Kmart, in fact, supports Named Plaintiffs: \n“[A]ccessible parking for disabled persons is a compliance measure required by the ADA.”  Id.\nat 1231 (cited in Class Opp. at 32).  Named Plaintiffs simply ask that -- in light of Kmart’s\nobligation to maintain accessible parking for disabled persons -- Kmart put in place policies\ndesigned to prevent and cure abuse of its accessible parking spaces by non-disabled individuals. \nKmart has stated that it will not do this, though it now disavows the testimony through which it\ndid so as the personal feelings of Robert Frame, without pointing to any policy affirmatively\nundertaking such monitoring.  (See Class Opp. at 33.)  Having presented Mr. Frame as their\n30(b)(6) designee on store operations including “enforcement of parking signage,” (Frame Decl. \n¶ 5), Kmart cannot disavow his testimony on the subject as a personal statement. \n-59-\n\nKmart also states that “supervision of the parking lot is often the responsibility of\nKmart’s landlord.”  (Class Opp. at 34.)  While this may be of import in assigning responsibility\nbetween Kmart and the landlord, both are liable to Named Plaintiffs to make the parking lots\naccessible.  Title III applies to both owners and lessees of places of public accommodation,\n§ 12182(a), and the DOJ regulations make clear that neither side can shirk this responsibility\nthrough lease language.  See U.S. Dept. of Justice, Title III of the Americans with Disabilities\nAct: Technical Assistance Manual, III-1.2000 (1992) (Mintz Decl. Ex. 10 at 7-8).  In any event,\nKmart concedes that under two of its three types of leases, it has at least some measure of\nresponsibility for the store’s exterior, (Frame Decl. ¶ 54,)  and even where Kmart claims it has\nshared or no responsibility -- semi-gross and gross leases -- it has asserted the authority to alter\nthe striping of the parking lot and deduct the cost from its rent.  (Glasser Decl. Ex. 2 at K01697 -\nK01700.)  \nStaff Assistance.  Kmart suggests throughout its Class Opposition that when barriers do\narise, Kmart staff are available to overcome them.  Staff assistance is rarely, however, a\nsubstitute for independent access.  In keeping with the goal of “assur[ing] equality of\nopportunity, full participation, independent living and economic self-sufficiency” for people with\ndisabilities, § 12101(a)(8), Title III of the ADA and its implementing regulations are designed to\npermit people who use wheelchairs independent physical access to goods and services wherever\npossible.  Goods and services may be made available through “alternative methods” -- for\nexample, retrieval of merchandise -- only in facilities built prior to January 26, 1993 where\nproviding physical access for people with disabilities is not “readily achievable.”  See\n-60-\n\n§ 12182(b)(2)(A)(v).  Thus, in all post-1993 facilities, § 12183(a)(1), any part of a pre-1993\nfacility that has been remodeled, § 12183(a)(2), and any unaltered pre-1993 facilities where\ndoing so is “readily achievable,” § 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv), independent access for people who use\nwheelchairs must be provided.  Since, as demonstrated above, few if any Kmart stores will be\nanalyzed under the “readily achievable” standard, the availability of assistance will not be a\nuseful defense for Kmart.\nConclusion\nFor the reasons set forth above and in the Class Memorandum, Named Plaintiffs\nrespectfully request that this Court certify a class defined as follows:  \nAll persons with disabilities who use wheelchairs or scooters for mobility who\nhave been denied, or are currently being denied, full and equal enjoyment of the\ngoods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any\npublic accommodation that was designed or constructed by or is owned, operated,\nor leased by or leased to Kmart Corporation anywhere in the United States. \nNamed Plaintiffs further request that they be certified as the representatives of this class and that\nthe attorneys listed below be certified as class counsel.  \n-61-\n\nRespectfully Submitted,\nFOX & ROBERTSON, P.C.\n                                                \nAmy F.

GEYER, \nSTACY BERLOFF, \nJEAN RYAN, \nJAN CAMPBELL, \non behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, \nPlaintiffs, \nv. \nKMART CORPORATION, \nDefendant. \nORDER CERTIFYING CLASS, APPROVING SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND \nENJOINING THE FILING OR PURSUIT OF RELEASED CLAIMS \nPlaintiffs Carrie Ann Lucas, Debbie Lane, Julie Reiskin, Edward Muegge, Robert Geyer, \nStacy Berloff, Jean Ryan and Jan Campbell, and Defendant Kmart Corporation (\"Kmart\"), \njointly moved the Court for an Order:  (I) holding that the notice issued in this case satisfied \nRule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and due process; (2) approving the proposed \nsettlement in this case as fair, reasonable and adequate; and (3) permanently enjoining class \nmembers and sub-class members from asserting any of the claims released pursuant to the \nsettlement agreement.  In addition, plaintiffs have moved for certification for settlement \npurposes only of the damages sub-class that the Court earlier certified preliminarily.  The Court \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 235    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 29\npreviously reviewed the settlement agreement executed by the parties (\"Settlement Agreement\" \nor \"Agreement\"), which is attached to this Order as an Appendix, concluded that it was fair, \nreasonable and adequate, and, on that basis, preliminarily approved it.  Lucas v. Kmart Com., \n234 F.R.D. 688 (D. Colo. 2006) (\"Preliminary Approval Order\").  The Court also approved the \nnotice plan proposed by the parties and the forms of notice.  Id. at 696-97.  Following the \nCourt's rulings, the parties executed the proposed notice plan.  In response to the approved \nnotice, the Court received only one objection. \nAfter considering the various briefs filed by the parties during the approval process, \nplaintiffs' motion for certification ofthe sub-class for settlement purposes, the testimony and \nevidence submitted with those pleadings and during the Fairness Hearing, and applicable law, \nthe Court will overrule the objection, grant the motions, certify the damages sub-class, approve \nthe Settlement Agreement, and enter the requested permanent injunction. \nApplicable Law, Facts and Procedural History \nI.  Applicable Statutes \nTitle III of the ADA prohibits disability discrimination in places of public \naccommodation.  42 U.S.c. § 12181 et seq.  The specific design criteria required by Title III are \nset forth in the Department of Justice Standards for Accessible Design (\"Standards\").  28 C.F.R. \npt. 36, app. A.  Title III is enforceable through a private right of action for injunctive relief, but \nTitle III does not provide a damages remedy for private plaintiffs.  42 U.S.C. § 12188(a)(I) & \n(2).  Successful plaintiffs are, however, entitled to attorneys' fees.  Id., § 12205.  Under \nCalifornia law, plaintiffs may also seek injunctive relief to require compliance with California's \n2 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 235    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 29\naccess standards, set forth in Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations.  See. e.g., Cal. Civ. \nCode §§ 5l(b), 52(c)(3), 54(a), 54.3(b); People ex reI. Deukmejian v. CHE. Inc., 197 Cal. Rptr. \n484,491 (Cal. Ct. App. 1983). \nCalifornia, Colorado, Hawai'i, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon and Texas (together, \nthe \"Sub-Class States\") each has a statute pursuant to which a prevailing plaintiff in a disability \ndiscrimination action against a public accommodation can be awarded damages in an amount \nspecified by statute without proving actual damages (\"Statutory Minimum Damages\").  The \nStatutory Minimum Damages recoverable in each state are as follows:  California ($4,000);1 \nColorado ($50);2 Hawaii ($1,000);3 Massachusetts ($300);4 New York ($100);5 Oregon ($200);6 \nand Texas ($100V \nII.  History ofthe Litigation, Negotiation, Preliminary Approval and Notice \nThis action was filed in 1999.  Between the spring of 2000 and January 2002, the parties \nconducted extensive discovery, including the production of over 100,000 pages of documents \nCal. Civ. Code § 52(a).  Minimum damages of$I,OOO are recoverable pursuant to Cal. \nCiv. Code § 54.3. \n2  Colo. Rev. Stat. § 24-34-602. \n3  Hawaii Statutes § 489-7.5. \n4  M.G.L.A. ch. 272 § 98. \n5  N.Y. Civ. R. §§ 40-c, 40-d; N.Y. Exec. § 296(2)(a). \n6  OKS. § 659A.885. \n7  Tex. Hum. Res. Code §§ 121.003; 121.004.  Due to a typographical error, the amount of \nStatutory Minimum Damages recoverable pursuant to these statutes was misstated in the \nPreliminary Approval Order at $200.  See Lucas, 234 F.R.D. at 691 n.7. \n3 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 235    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 29\nand more than 50 depositions.  Plaintiffs filed their motion for class certification in July 2001 \nand there was extensive briefing on that issue.  In January 2002, Kmart declared bankruptcy. \nDuring the pendency of Kmart' s bankruptcy, plaintiffs attempted unsuccessfully to lift the \nbankruptcy stay as it applied to this case.  After Kmart emerged from bankruptcy in May 2003, \nthe parties appeared before this Court to address whether this matter had been discharged in \nbankruptcy.  This Court ruled that the matter could proceed. \nOn July 13, 2005, after additional briefing, the Court granted plaintiffs' motion for class \ncertification and certified a nationwide class of individuals who use wheelchairs or scooters and \nwho shop at Kmart stores (the \"Nationwide Class\").  Kmart immediately sought and obtained \npermission from the Tenth Circuit to appeal that decision under Rule 23(f) of the Federal Rilles \nof Civil Procedure (\"F.R.C.P.\").  As a result of the parties reaching the settlement presently \nbefore the Court, briefing before the Tenth Circuit was not completed. \nIn August 2005, the parties initiated the settlement negotiations that yielded the \nSettlement Agreement submitted to the Court.  These settlement negotiations were ongoing from \nAugust 2005 to February 2006.  As part ofthose negotiations, Kmart provided plaintiffs with \nadditional documents relating to topics addressed during the negotiations and made \narrangements for plaintiffs' expert to survey two Kmart stores.  In addition to extensive \ntelephone and email conversations, the parties engaged in two multi-day, in-person negotiating \nsessions along with other shorter meetings. \nThe parties' initial negotiations concerned injunctive relief.  The parties reached \nagreement concerning a large part of the injunctive relief before turning to damages, and the \n4 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 235    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 29\nnegotiations concerning damages and injnnctive relief were kept completely separate from one \nanother.  The parties did not discuss attorneys' fees nntil there was substantial agreement on all \nparts of the injnnctive and damages settlement.  Both parties have been represented throughout \nthese negotiations by connsel with extensive experience in disability rights and class action \nlitigation. \nOnce the settlement was ahnost finalized, Class Connsel provided the draft Settlement \nAgreement to prominent members of the disability rights commnnity across the conntry.  The \nparties incorporated into the Settlement Agreement several suggestions that they received \nthrough this process. \nAt the Fairness Hearing, named plaintiff Carrie Ann Lucas testified to the origins of this \ncase and to her involvement in each step of both the litigation and settlement negotiations.  Class \nCounsel Amy F. Robertson testified to the extensive discovery in which the parties engaged and \nthe hard-fought briefing on the question of class certification.  Although active litigation largely \nceased after the Nationwide Class was certified, both the discovery and the class certification \nbriefing addressed a number of the key merits questions in this case.  Ms. Robertson also \ntestified to the arm's length settlement negotiations that, while amicable, were vigorous and at \ntimes contentious. \nAs noted above, on March 22, 2006, this Court granted preliminary approval ofthe \nSettlement Agreement and held that the parties' proposed notice plan satisfied the requirements \nof due process and F.R.C.P. 23.  Lucas v. Kmart Com., 234 F.R.D. 688, 695-97 (D. Colo. 2006). \n5 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 235    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 29\nFollowing that order, the parties provided notice in accordance with the approved notice \nplan.  This included mailing a copy ofthe notice and claim form to a list of over 250,000 \nindividuals who use wheelchairs, 1,003 individuals who had contacted Class Counsel concerning \nbarriers in places of public accommodation, and to 799 organizations focused on people with \ndisabilities.  Summary notices were published in Parade, USA Weekend, People, People en \nEspafiol, Reader's Digest, Vista, New Mobilitv, Paraplegia News, and Sports N' Spokes.  A \ntoll-free telephone line with an interactive voice response system to address questions from class \nmembers was set up, as was a website dedicated to the settlement.  The latter permitted users to \ndownload a copy of the notice and claim form. \nKmart posted a one-page notice at multiple locations in each store and placed a link to \nthe settlement website on its website (www.kmart.com).  In response to a request by Class \nCounsel, a number of disability rights organizations placed a link to the notice on their websites, \nand the notice was circulated to a number of disability-oriented email mailing lists.  Following \nthe Court's preliminary approval, the settlement received extensive press coverage.  The \nextensive notice program undertaken by the parties cost more than $1 million. \nThe parties submitted a declaration from Jeanne C. Finegan, an expert in the design of \nnotice programs such as the one approved by this Court.  Ms. Finegan opined that the notice \nprogram implemented in this case was the best notice practicable under the circumstances. \nBased on her analysis, the publication portion of the notice program is estimated to have reached \nmore than 73 % ofthe targeted individuals.  This estimate did not even take into account the \n6 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 235    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 29\npublications targeted at individuals with disabilities, the direct mailings, the in-store notices, and \nthe various other aspects of the notice program. \nIn response to this extensive notice program, the Court received only one objection:  a \none-page letter from Marc Miller of Bloomington, Illinois, objecting to the fact that the \ndefinition of the Nationwide Class includes individuals who may become disabled in the future. \n(Docket No. 224.) \nIII.  Summary of the Settlement \nThe Nationwide Class is defined in the Settlement Agreement as: \nall persons who, at any time from May 6,2003 through the Term of this \nAgreement, used, use or will use wheelchairs or scooters for mobility and who \nshopped or shop at any Kmart Store or any Closed Kmart Store or who allege \nthey would shop or would have shopped at one or more Kmart Stores or Closed \nKmart Stores but for allegedly being denied on the basis of disability the full and \nequal enjoyment ofthe goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or \naccommodations of such Kmart Store(s) or Closed Kmart Store(s). \n(Agreement ~ 3.30.) \nThe Damages Sub-Class consists of: \nall Settlement Class Members who, at any time from May 6, 2003 through the \nTerm of this Agreement, shopped or shop at any Kmart Store or Closed Kmart \nStore in the Statutory Minimum Damages States or who allege that they would \nhave shopped or would shop at one or more Kmart Stores or Closed Kmart Stores \nin the Statutory Minimum Damages States but for allegedly being denied on the \nbasis of disability the full and equal enjoyment ofthe goods, services, facilities, \nprivileges, advantages, or accommodations of such Kmart Store(s) or Closed \nKmart Store(s). \n(rd. ~ 3.1 0.) \n7 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 235    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 29\nIn summary,8 under the proposed settlement agreement: \n•  Within approximately seven and a half years, Kmart will survey all of its stores \nand bring them into compliance with the Department of Justice Standards for \nAccessible Design, subject to limited exceptions, to the extent that they relate to \naccessibility for people who use wheelchairs or scooters for mobility; with respect \nto its stores in California, Kmart will also bring those stores into compliance with \nTitle 24 of the California Code of Regulations, subject to limited exceptions, to \nthe extent that the provisions of Title 24 relate to accessibility for people who use \nwheelchairs or scooters for mobility (id. ~ 6); \n•  Kmart will ensure that all merchandise on \"fixed displays\" - including gondolas, \nperimeter walls, and \"I\" walls - as well as large appliances, drive aisle displays \nand sidewalk displays will be on an accessible route of at least 36 inches (id. \n~~ 12.6.1-.3, 12.6.8); \n•  Kmart will ensure that all accessible restrooms and fitting rooms will be on an \naccessible route and maintained free and clear of obstructions (id. ~~ 12.6.5-.6); \n•  Kmart will ensure that at least one accessible check-out lane is open at all times \nthe store is open fuh ~ 12.5); \n•  Kmart will, in all but 10% of its stores, provide a path of at least 32 inches to at \nleast one side of moveable apparel displays in 80% of floor space occupied by \nThe description of the settlement set forth in this Order is simply a general summary of \n8 \nsome of its terms.  The operative terms of the settlement are those that are set forth in the \nSettlement Agreement itself, which is attached as an Appendix hereto. \n8 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 235    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 29\nmoveable displays as well as a distance of 32 inches between certain types of \nmoveable apparel displays when they are placed next to one another (id. \n~~ 12.1-.2); \n•  Kmart will implement a customer service system for access to moveable apparel \ndisplays and furniture displays under which customers with disabilities who use \nwheelchairs or scooters for mobility will have the option of requesting assistance \nor requesting that Kmart provide them with a two-way communication device so \nthat they may summon assistance when they need it fuh ~ 12.3); \n•  Kmart will amend its policy and training materials to implement these new \npolicies fuh ~ 13); \n•  Compliance will be monitored using \"mystery shoppers,\" as well as customer \nfeedback through the Internet, a toll-free phone line, and in-store forms (id. \n~~ 14.3-.4); \n•  The Nationwide Class will release claims for injunctive relief under Title ill of \nthe ADA, under state statutes that incorporate or are equivalent to Title ill, and \nunder California law tluough the end of the Term of the Agreement, which is \nexpected to be approximately 2014 (id. ~ 26.1); \n•  Kmart will establish a fund (the \"Damages Sub-Class Fund\") in the amount of \n$13,000,000 (consisting of$8,000,000 in cash and $5,000,000 in gift cards \nredeemable at face value) from which members of the Damages Sub-Class are \neligible to recover (id. ~ 15.1.1); \n9 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 235    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of\n 29\n•  The Damages Sub-Class Fund will be allocated among the Sub-Class States based \non a formula that reflects the number ofKmart stores in each Sub-Class State, and \nthe Statutory Minimum Damages recoverable in each Sub-Class State (id. \n~ 15.5.2); \n•  For each qualifying visit to a Kmart store, a member ofthe Sub-Class may \nrecover up to the Statutory Minimum Damages recoverable in the Sub-Class State \nin which he or she shopped, and the maximum number of qualifying visits for \nwhich a Sub-Class member may recover is two (id. ~ 15.5.3.3); \n•  Kmart will pay damages in the amount of$10,000 each to the three original \nnamed plaintiffs, and $1,000 each to the six named plaintiffs of the Damages \nSub-Class (id. ~ 15.2); \n•  The majority of any funds remaining in the Damages Sub-Class Fund after the \nclaims period will be given to specified non-profit entities that advocate for the \nrights of persons with disabilities (id. ~ 15.6); \n•  Members of the Damages Sub-Class have the right to opt out of the damages \nprovisions of the Settlement Agreement, but members ofthe Class and Sub-Class \ncannot opt out of the injunctive provisions <ill ~ 16); \n•  In addition to releasing claims for injunctive relief under Title Ill, equivalent state \nstatutes, and California law, Damages Sub-Class members will release claims for \nStatutory Minimum Damages under the laws of the seven Sub-Class States \n10 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 235    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of\n 29\nthrough the end of the Tenn of the Agreement, but will not release claims for any \nother damages ful ~ 26.2); \n•  No member of the Nationwide Class will release damages claims with respect to \nthe laws of any state other than those of the Sub-Class States (id. ~ 26.2); \n•  Kmart has agreed to pay attorneys' fees up to the date of final approval in the \namount of $3,250,000 and will pay Class Counsel additional reasonable fees in \nthe futnre for work that they do during the Tenn of the Agreement implementing \nand assnring compliance with the Agreement (id. ~ 20.2);9 \n•  The Tenn of the Agreement will expire thirty days after the physical remediation \nof the last store is verified or the last dispute resolution process is concluded (id. \n~ 5); and \n•  The Settlement Agreement calls for this Court to retain continuing jurisdiction \nthroughout the Tenn ofthe Agreement to interpret and enforce the Agreement (id. \n~ 35). \nTwo representatives of Kmart testified at the Fairness Hearing concerning the extensive \nefforts that Kmart has undertaken and is preparing to undertake to implement both the \narchitectnral and policy aspects of this Settlement.  It is clear to the Court that Kmart takes its \nobligations seriously and is taking appropriate steps to ensnre compliance with the Agreement. \nExperienced attorneys representing both the Class and Kmart offered their opinion that \nthis Settlement was fair, reasonable and adequate, as did all named plaintiffs of both the \n9  Class Counsel has separately submitted a fee petition supporting its claim for this award. \n11 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 235    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of\n 29\nNationwide Class and the Damages Sub-Class.  A representative of the National Disability \nRights Network and an architect who is an expert in accessibility compliance both testified at the \nFairness Hearing that, based on their experience in this area, the Settlement Agreement was fair, \nreasonable and adequate. \nDISCUSSION \nI.  The Damages Sub-Class Is Certified. \nThis Conrt has preliminarily certified the Damages Sub-Class.  Lucas v. Kmart, 2006 WL \n* \n722163, at  6 (D. Colo. Mar. 22, 2006).  Plaintiffs have moved for an order certifying this Sub \nClass for settlement purposes only.  For the reasons set forth in my March 22 Order, I will grant \nthat motion and certify the Damages Sub-Class under F .R.C.P. 23(a ) and both F .R.C.P. 23(b )(2) \nand F.R.C.P. 23(b)(3). \nII.  Notice Provided by the Parties Satisfies Rule 23 and Due Process. \nThis Court previously approved the parties' proposed notice plan and the proposed forms \nof notice.  Lucas, 234 F.R.D. at 695-97.  The Court held that the requirements of due process and \nF.R.C.P. 23 would be satisfied if, on or before May 8, 2006, the parties executed a multi-faceted \nnotice plan that is described in detail in the Court's Preliminary Approval Order.  Id. \nSince then, the parties satisfied all the elements of the notice plan approved by the Conrt \nin the Preliminary Approval Order.  The parties sent out individual notice to more than 250,000 \npotential class members, including individuals who had contacted Class Counsel about the issues \nraised in this litigation.  The parties undertook an expansive nationwide publication program that \nincluded both mainstream media and publications targeted at individuals who use wheelchairs or \n12 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 235    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of\n 29\nscooters.  The parties notified almost 800 organizations focused on people with disabilities ofthe \npending settlement.  Kmart posted an in-store version of the notice in all of its stores and posted \na link to the notice on its website.  All of these steps were undertaken within the timeframe set \nforth in the Preliminary Approval Order. \nIn fact, the parties undertook additional steps relating to notice above and beyond those \nin the extensive plan approved by the Court.  For example, the notice was sent to email lists \nfocused on individuals with disabilities and posted on the web sites of various groups focused on \nindividuals with disabilities. \nThe notice program implemented by the parties to this settlement goes above and beyond \nthat required by law.  For the reasons set forth in the Preliminary Approval Order, id. at 695-97, \nthe Court holds that the notice program implemented by the parties was the best notice \npracticable under the circumstances and satisfied the requirements of due process and F .R.c.P. \n23. \nIII.  The Settlement is Fair, Reasonable and Adequate. \nIn enacting the ADA, Congress provided specifically that \"[w]here appropriate and to the \nextent authorized by law, the use of alternative means of dispute resolution, including settlement \nnegotiations ... is encouraged to resolve disputes arising under this chapter.\" 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12212.  As the Seventh Circuit has noted, settlement is especially appropriate where \n''voluntary compliance by the parties over an extended period will contribute significantly \ntoward ultimate achievement of statutory goals.\" Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp. v. Village of \nArlington Heights, 616 F.2d 1006,1014 (7th Cir. 1980).  Here, the parties are undertaking to \n13 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 235    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 14 of\n 29\nimplement a comprehensive settlement over a period of years that will significantly promote the \nachievement of the goals of the ADA. \n\"The authority to approve a settlement of a class ... action is committed to the sound \ndiscretion ofthe trial court.\"  Jones v. Nuclear Pharmacy, Inc., 741 F.2d 322, 324 (lOth Cir. \n1984).  Under F.R.C.P. 23(e)(l)(C), in considering whether to approve a class action settlement, \na court should consider whether the settlement is \"fair, reasonable, and adequate.\" In the Tenth \nCircuit, the following factors are to be analyzed in determining whether this standard is met: \n(1) whether the proposed settlement was fairly and honestly negotiated; (2) \nwhether serious questions oflaw and fact exist, placing the ultimate outcome of \nthe litigation in doubt; (3) whether the value of an immediate recovery outweighs \nthe mere possibility of future relief after protracted and expensive litigation; and \n(4) the judgment of the parties that the settlement is fair and reasonable. \nRutter & Wilbanks Com. v. Shell Oil Co., 314 F.3d 1180, 1188 (10th Cir. 2002). \nThis Court has already preliminarily concluded that the Settlement Agreement satisfies \nthese four prongs and that it and the allocation of the Damages Sub-Class Fund are fair, \nreasonable and adequate.  Lucas, 234 F.R.D. at 693-95.  The evidence submitted with the \nparties' Motion for Final Approval of Settlement Agreement and the testimony at the Fairness \nHearing further support this conclusion.  The Court therefore finds that the Settlement \nAgreement satisfies the four Rutter & Wilbanks prongs and is fair, reasonable and adequate. \nA.  The Agreement was Fairly and Honestly Negotiated. \nThere are numerous indicia that the settlement negotiations in this case have been fair, \nhonest and at arm's length. \n14 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 235    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of\n 29\nFirst, the parties to this litigation have ''vigorously advocated their respective positions \nthroughout the pendency of the case.\"  See Wilkerson v. Martin Marietta Com., 171 F.R.D. 273, \n284 (D. Colo. 1997).  This case has been litigated over the course of six years, during which time \nboth parties engaged in extensive written and deposition discovery, filed a number of contested \ndiscovery motions, and filed more than a dozen briefs related to class certification.  The \nSettlement Agreement itself took six months to negotiate, and came only after several previous \nattempts at negotiating a settlement had failed.  These negotiations involved multiple in-person \nmeetings, during which both sides were represented by experienced counsel. \nBecause the settlement resulted from arm's length negotiations between experienced \ncounsel after significant discovery had occurred, the Court may presume the settlement to be \nfair, adequate and reasonable.  See,~, Wal-Mart Stores. Inc. v. Visa U.S.A.. Inc., 396 F.3d 96, \n116 (2d Cir.), cert. denied sub nom., Leonardo's Pizza by the Slice. Inc. v. Wal-Mart Stores, \nInc., 125 S. Ct. 2277 (2005) (a '''presumption offairness, adequacy, and reasonableness may \nattach to a class settlement reached in arm's-length negotiations between experienced, capable \ncounsel after meaningful discovery.'\"  (quoting Manual for Complex Litigation. Third § 30.42 \n(1995))). \nThe fact that the parties did not discuss damages until they had made substantial progress \non the injunctive issues, and did not discuss attorneys' fees until all other issues were virtually \n• \nfinalized, is also indicative of a fair and arm's-length process.  See. e.g., Manual for Complex \nLitig., Fourth § 21.7 at 335 (2004) (\"Separate negotiation ofthe class settlement before an \nagreement on fees is generally preferable.\"). \n15 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 235    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 16 of\n 29\nB.  Serious Questions of Law and Fact Exist. \nAlthough it is not the role of the Court at this stage of the litigation to evaluate the merits, \nWilkerson, 171 F.R.D. at 284, it is clear that the parties could reasonably conclude that there are \nserious questions of law and fact that exist such that they could significantly impact this case if it \nwere litigated. \nFor example, Kmart argued that plaintiffs' claims were discharged through its \nbankruptcy.  Although the Court rejected that argument, Kmart could appeal this issue, argue \nthat plaintiffs' claims should have been dismissed, and potentially wipe out any successful result \nthat the plaintiffs might achieve.  Similarly, the Tenth Circuit granted interlocutory appeal of the \ndecision certifying the Nationwide Class in this case.  If this case were litigated, the Tenth \nCircuit could reverse or modify this Court's class certification decision. \nThere is also a serious disagreement between the parties concerning the legal standards \napplicable to stores built before January 26, 1993.  With respect to those stores, Kmart contends \nthat it was required to make only those changes that were \"readily achievable\" under 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv).  Plaintiffs disagree, arguing that, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12183(a)(2), \nKmart was required to bring those stores into compliance with the Department of Justice \nStandards for Accessible Design.  There are numerous contested factual issues that relate to this \npoint. \nThe question of access to merchandise on moveable displays was also hotly contested. \nPlaintiffs took the position that all such merchandise was required to be on an accessible route of \nat least 36 inches.  See Standards § 4.1.3(12)(b).  Defendants argued that the case law provided \n16 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 235    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 17 of\n 29\nthat t~ere was no such requirement.  See,~, Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition v. Too \n(Delaware), Inc., 344 F. Supp. 2d 707, 715 (D. Colo. 2004); Lieber v. Macy's West. Inc., 80 F. \nSupp. 2d 1065, 1077 (N.D. Cal. 1999). \nThere were thus numerous factual and legal questions yet to be addressed in this \nlitigation that could have had a serious impact on the results for either side. \nC.  The Value of an Immediate Recovery Outweighs the Mere Possibility of \nFuture Relief after Protracted and Expensive Litigation. \nIfthis case were to be litigated, in all probability it would be many years before it would \nbe resolved.  The appeal ofthis Court's class certification decision alone could take a year.  And \nif this Court's decision were upheld, then the parties could potentially be faced with surveying \neach ofKmart's stores so that disputed factual issues could be resolved. \nBy contrast, the proposed Settlement Agreement provides the class with substantial, \nguaranteed relief.  And the class will start to gain the benefits from this settlement in the near \nfuture, instead of having to wait several more years for this litigation to be fought out to a \njudgment. \nPursuant to the Settlement Agreement: \n•  Kmart will survey each of its stores in the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam, and \nthe Virgin Islands using surveyors trained by Jim Terry, a nationally-known \nexpert in ADA compliance. \n•  Architectural elements that are fonnd through the surveys to be out of compliance \nwith the Standards will be brought into compliance with the Standards, subject to \n17 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 235    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 18 of\n 29\nlimited exceptions, to the extent that they relate to accessibility for people who \nuse wheelchairs or scooters for mobility; \n•  As part of the settlement, Kmart has agreed not to assert the readily-achievable \ndefense under the ADA during this process.  See 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b) (2)(A)(iv). \n•  Kmart will put in place policies to ensure that its stores are accessible to class \nmembers, including, for example, making sure that an accessible check-out lane \nis open, that all merchandise on fixed displays is on an accessible path of travel, \nthat Kmart employees are available to assist class members in accessing \nmoveable apparel displays and furniture displays, and that restrooms and fitting \nrooms are accessible. \nThe Settlement Agreement also provides for substantial damages for members of the \nproposed Damages Sub-Class.  The settlement establishes a $13,000,000 fund from which \nmembers of the sub-class may recover.  In return, members of the sub-class are releasing only \ntheir claims for Statutory Minimum Damages and not their claims for actual damages.  See. e.g., \nBowling v. Pfizer. Inc., 143 F.R.D. 141,170 (S.D. Ohio 1992) (approving class action settlement \nin part because oflimited nature of damages release, such that class members retained most of \ntheir rights). \nD.  The Judgment of the Parties That the Settlement Is Fair and Reasonable. \n\"Counsels' judgment as to the fairness ofthe agreement is entitled to considerable \nweight.\" Marcus v. Kansas Dept. of Revenue, 209 F. Supp. 2d 1179, 1183 (D. Kan. 2002). \nHere, the parties' counsel-among whom are attorneys with substantial experience in complex \n18 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 235    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 19 of\n 29\nclass action litigation and disability class actions - unanimously support this settlement, as do \nall of the Named Plaintiffs. \nE.  Incentive Payments to Named Plaintiffs. \nThe Settlement provides for payment of $10,000 each to tbe original named plaintiffs of \ntbe Nationwide Class and of$I,OOO each to the named plaintiffs for tbe Damages Sub-Class. \nBased on the testimony of Class Counsel concerning tbe effort these individuals undertook and \ntheir contributions to the litigation, these payments are entirely appropriate.  See Cimarron \nPipeline Constro> Inc. v. Nat'l Council on Compo Ins., Nos. CN 89-822-T & CN 89-1 18 6-T, \n* \n1993 WL 355466, at  2 (W.D. Okla. June 8, 1993) (holding tbat payments of $1 0,000 to class \nrepresentatives was appropriate in light of \"their time and effort in asserting tbe interests ofthe \nClass, meeting discovery and otber litigation responsibilities, and working witb counsel to \nadvance the interests of the Class\"). \nF.  Allocation of the Damages Sub-Class Fund. \nThe Court has also considered whether the distribution plan contained in the settlement is \nfair, reasonable, and adequate.  See. e.g., In re Lorazepam & Clorazepate Antitrust Litig., 205 \nF.R.D. 369,381 (D.D.C. 2002).  The Court finds that it is. \n\"Allocation formulas ... are recognized as an appropriate means to reflect the \ncomparative strengths and values of different categories of the claim. . .. An allocation formula \nneed only have a reasonable, rational basis, particularly if recommended by 'experienced and \ncompetent' class counsel.\"  In re Am. Bank Note Holographics. Inc., 127 F. Supp. 2d 418, \n19 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 235    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 20 of\n 29\n429-30 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (citations omitted); see also Maleyv. Del Global Techs. Corp., 186 F. \nSupp. 2d 358,367 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (same). \nIn this case, the settlement provides compensation for the release of claims for Statutory \nMinimum Damages under the laws ofthe seven Sub-Class States.  Two factors affect the relative \nstrength and value ofthe claims among these states. \nFirst, the Statutory Minimum Damages that may be recovered differ among the states, \nfrom $50 in Colorado to $4,000 in California. \nSecond, the number of class members differs among the states.  States with a greater \nnumber of class members who encountered barriers at Kmart stores should receive a larger \nportion of the damages.  There is no way to determine the precise number of class members who \nencountered barriers in each state.  As a reasonable approximation,IO the parties have used the \nnumber ofKmart stores in each state, based on the common-sense assumption that the greater \nthe number of Kmart stores in a state, the greater the number of class members who have \nencountered barriers in that state. \nThe allocation formula agreed upon by the parties is as follows:  Each Sub-Class State is \nassigned a \"Factorial,\" which is the product ofthe number ofKmart stores (including any stores \nthat were open at any time during which damages are recoverable) in that state times the \nStatutory Minimum Damages recoverable in the state.  For example, the California Factorial is \n10  In a class action settlement, \"damages need not be calculated with precision in \ndetermining a plan of allocation for settlement proceeds; the only requirement is that the \nallocation be fair and reasonable.\" In re Veritas Software Corp. Sec. Litig., No. C-03-0283 \nMMC, 2005 WL 3096079, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 15,2005). \n20 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 235    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 21 of\n 29\n520,000, which is the product of 130 (the number of California Kmart stores) and 4,000 (the \nStatutory Minimum Damages recoverable in California). \nThe percentage of the Damages Sub-Class Fund allocated to a Sub-Class State is \ndetermined by dividing that state's Factorial by the combined sum of the Factorials of all \nSub-Class States. \nBy allocating the Damages Sub-Class Fund based on the Statutory Minimum Damages \nrecoverable in each state, and by the number ofKmart stores in each state, the formula has a \n\"reasonable, rational basis,\" and is recommended by experienced, competent counsel.  Thus the \nallocation formula satisfies F.R.C.P. 23.  See In re Am. Bank Note, 127 F. Supp. 2d at 429-30. \nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court holds that the settlement is fair, reasonable and \nadequate. \nIV.  The Objection Is Overruled. \nThis Court received only one objection to the Settlement Agreement.  Marc Miller of \nBloomington, Illinois - an individual who does not, himself, use a wheelchair or scooter -\nchallenges the inclusion of individuals who may become disabled in the future in the settlement \nclasses.  He asserts:  \"[b] ecause individuals may become disabled in the future but are not \ncurrently disabled, they may not understand that they will be included in the class\" and that \"it is \nimproper to settle claims for individuals in the future.\"  (Docket No. 224.)  He therefore asks that \nthe class defmition for the Nationwide Class be rewritten to exclude individuals who become \ndisabled in the future. \n21 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 235    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 22 of\n 29\nContrary to Mr. Miller's objection, it is both common and proper to include future class \nmembers in a class definition where, as here, the predominant relief is injunctive.  For example, \nin Kilgo v. Bowman Transportation. Inc., 789 F.2d 859,878 (11th Cir. 1986), the Eleventh \nCircuit affirmed the certification of a class of current and prospective female applicants for \nemployment at a company.  Similarly, in Comer v. Cisneros, 37 F.3d 775,779 (2d Cir. 1994), \nthe Second Circuit held that the plaintiffs could pursue a class action \"on behalf of all former, \ncurrent, and future minority residents of Buffalo, New York housing projects.\" See also United \nStates Parole Comm'n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 393 (1980); Crawford v. Gould, 56 F.3d 1162, \n1163 (9th Cir. 1995); Neiberger v. Hawkins, 208 F.R.D. 301, 320 (D. Colo. 2002).  Potential \nfuture class members are regularly included in classes in actions under the ADA.  See. e.g., Neff \nv. Via Metro Transit Auth., 179 F.R.D. 185, 193 (W.D. Tex. 1998); Messier v. Southbury \nTraining Sch., 183 F.R.D. 350, 356 (D. Conn. 1998); Siddiqi v. Regents of the Univ. of \nCalifornia, 2000 WL 33190435, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 6,2000). \nIn many cases when relief is primarily injunctive, the relief is not individual but rather is \nobtained on behalf of an entire class.  Relief relating to, for example, treatment of prisoners, \nhiring policies, school entrance tests, or architectural changes cannot be framed one way with \nrespect to one potential class member and some other way with respect to another potential class \nmember.  Hence, classes seeking or obtaining primarily injunctive relief are certified as \nmandatory classes nnder F.R.C.P. 23(b) (2) - because the relief is \"with respect to the class as a \nwhole.\" In these circumstances, \"unknown future class members should be properly considered \nand included as a part ofthe class.\" Neff, 179 F.R.D. at 193.  Because, \"while the identities of \n22 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 235    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 23 of\n 29\nthe individuals involved may change, the nature of the harm and the basic parameters of the \ngroup affected remain constant.\" Bruce v. Christian, 113 F.R.D. 554, 557 (S.D.N.Y. 1987). \nExcluding future class members from classes would create \"unnecessary harm and repetitive \nlitigation.\" Dixon v. Bowen, 673 F. Supp. 123, 127 (S.D.N.Y. 1987). \nThe parties submit, and the Court agrees, that the rationale for including future class \nmembers in class definitions is particularly strong in the context of ADA public accommodation \ncases such as this one.  Because the architectural and design changes sought in most public \naccommodation cases cannot be made instantaneously, a public accommodation settlement \nusually must provide a period of time over which alterations to the relevant public \naccommodations are to be made.  See, lUb Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition v. Taco Bell \nCom., Civil Action No. 97-B-2135 (D. Colo.); Farrar-Kuhn v. Conoco. Inc., Civil Action No. \n99-MK-2086 (D. Colo.). \nConsistent with these other settlements, the Settlement Agreement here contains carefully \nnegotiated terms setting forth, among other terms, an eight-year plan to survey and remediate \nmore than 1,400 stores.  The Settlement Agreement, in turn, resolves claims under various \naccessibility laws.  Under Mr. Miller's approach, however, a newly disabled individual would be \nable to bring a claim alleging that Kmart was violating accessibility laws, even while Kmart was \nacting in accordance with a court-approved class action settlement resolving claims under those \nvery laws.  In other words, at the same time as receiving all the benefits obtained in the \nsettlement, he or she could seek injunctive relief that would functionally be challenging the very \nterms ofthe settlement. \n23 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 235    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 24 of\n 29\nTo pennit such claims during the Tenn ofthe Settlement Agreement would threaten its \nvery foundation.  See Newberg on Class Actions § 3:7 (rev. 4th ed. supp. 2006) (\"Inclusion of \nfuture class members within a class, when otherwise appropriate under Rule 23(a) tests, will \ngreatly enhance the effectiveness of the finaljudgment.\").  Moreover, to bar classes in ADA \npublic accommodation lawsuits from including future members would negatively impact the \nability of parties to negotiate effective public accommodation settlements.  Defendants would \nsurely be hesitant to enter into settlements if they were faced with the possibility that the \nreleases - and thus the stability - they obtain in return for the commitments they undertake in \nsettlements could be disrupted or challenged by any newly disabled individual who decides to \npursue a lawsuit. \nMiller also obj ects that he \"cannot detennine with certainty if [he isla member of the \nsubclass entitled to a monetary award.\"  (Ill) This is easily resolved:  because he does not \ncurrently use a wheelchair or scooter, he is not entitled to a monetary award under the Settlement \nAgreement. \nIf Mr. Miller becomes disabled in the future, then like any other present or future class \nmember, he will be entitled to pursue any claims for actual damages that he might have.  The \nonly claim that he might not be able to pursue would be a claim for Statutory Minimum \nDamages, ifhe is shopping in a Kmart in a state providing for such damages.  The Settlement \nAgreement bars claims for Statutory Minimum Damages during the Tenn of the Agreement to \nthe extent that such claims arise out of or relate to actions, conduct or conditions at Kmart stores \nthat are in compliance with the Settlement Agreement.  That release is derived directly from, and \n24 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 235    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 25 of\n 29\nis incidental to, the substantial injunctive relief provided by the settlement.  It simply (and \nproperly) provides that Kmart will not be exposed to a form of damages that do not require \nactual harm and that are intended to be \"penal\" in nature, see, e.g., Koire v. Metro Car Wash, \n707 P.2d 195, 200 (Cal. 1985), while acting in compliance with the terms of a court-approved \ninjunctive settlement.  Moreover, the release does not differentiate between those who are \nI I \npresently disabled and those who might become disabled during the Term ofthe Agreement.12 \nMr. Miller's obj ection is overruled.  Indeed, the fact that there was only a single \nobjection, even after the massive notice program that was undertaken, provides further support \nfor the fairness ofthe settlement.  See, e.g., Lipuma v. Am. Express Co., 406 F. Supp. 2d 1298, \n1324 (S.D. Fla. 2005) (\"a low percentage of objections points to the reasonableness of a \nproposed settlement and supports its approval\"); Newberg on Class Actions § II :41 (rev. 4th ed. \nsupp. 2006) (Among the considerations favoring approval is \"[t]hat the number of objectors or \ninterests they represent is not large when compared to the class as a whole.\"). \nV.  Class and Sub-Class Members will be Permanently Enjoined from Asserting \nReleased Claims. \nIn its Preliminary Approval Order, the Court preliminarily enjoined members of the class \nand the sub-class from pursuing any of the claims to be released pursuant to the Settlement \nThis is a completely different situation than that presented in Molski v. Gleich, 318 F.3d \nII \n937 (9th Cir. 2003), where a settlement purported to release statutory minimum damages claims \nthat accrued prior to the settlement for minimal consideration. \nFor this reason, among many others, the Settlement Agreement does not raise the issues \n12 \npresented by Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591 (1997). \n25 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 235    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 26 of\n 29\nAgreement.  Lucas, 234 F.R.D. at 697-98.  The parties now ask the Court to make that injunction \npermanent.  The Court will do so. \nm addition to the Conrt's inherent power, this Court \"may issue all writs necessary or \nappropriate in aid of [its] respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of \nlaw\" pursuant to the All Writs Act.  28 U.S.C. § 1651(a).  Numerous conrts have held that under \nthe All Writs Act, a court presiding over a class action settlement may enjoin class members \nfrom bringing related litigation in other conrts.  See. e.g., Hillman v. Webley. 115 F.3d 1461, \n1469 (10th Cir. 1997) (in connection with class action settlement, \"[t]he district conrt \nundoubtedly had the authority under the All Writs Act to enjoin parties before it from pursuing \nconflicting litigation ... \"); In re VMS Sec. Litig., 103 F.3d 1317, 1324 (7th Cir. 1996) (\"in the \ncontext of complex class action litigation, a federal district court may appropriately use the All \nWrits Act to ... enjoin the prosecution of subsequent state conrt claims ...\" ); see also 7B \nCharles Alan Wright, et aI., Federal Practice and Procedure § 1798.1 (\"an injunction ... to \nprotect the court's power ... may be particularly appropriate once a settlement has been reached \nand judgment entered as part of that settlement\"). \nThe Conrt believes that it is particularly appropriate to issue an injunction in this case \nbecause the settlement has a term of approximately seven and a half years during which the \nConrt will continue to retain jurisdiction over this matter.  Therefore, because the Court finds \nthat it would aid in the protection of its jurisdiction and is necessary in order to effectuate this \nsettlement, the Court hereby permanently enjoins members of the Nationwide Class and the \nDamages Sub-Class from asserting or pursuing: \n26 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 235    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 27 of\n 29\n1.

Lane and Julie Reiskin, by and through their\nattorneys, Fox & Robertson, P.C., and Kevin Williams, hereby bring this Amended Class Action\nComplaint against Defendant Kmart Corporation (“Kmart”) for violation of the Americans with\nDisabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12182 et seq. (“ADA”) and the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act,\nC.R.S. § 24-34-601 et seq. (“CADA”).  \nINTRODUCTION\n1.  On July 26, 1990, President Bush signed the ADA, thereby establishing the most\nimportant civil rights law for persons with disabilities in our country’s history. The ADA was\neffective as to Kmart on January 26, 1992.  One of the principal goals of the ADA was the\nintegration of people with disabilities into our economic and social life.  Kmart’s actions\nfrustrate this purpose and continue to impede the important goals of the ADA.   \n2.  Over nine years later – and despite extensive publicity –  Kmart continues to discriminate\nagainst persons who use wheelchairs.  Among other violations, Kmart provides insufficient\nparking for persons with disabilities, has counters that are too high for persons who use\n\nwheelchairs, fails to provide accessible check-out aisles to persons who use wheelchairs, fails to\nprovide accessible fitting rooms and blocks access to merchandise aisles for persons who use\nwheelchairs.  Kmart has failed to remedy this discrimination despite being told about these\nproblems on numerous occasions by Plaintiff Carrie Ann Lucas.  \nJURISDICTION\n1.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331\nand 1343 and pendent jurisdiction over the state law claims alleged herein.\n2.  Venue is proper within this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391.\nPARTIES\n1.  Plaintiff Carrie Ann Lucas is and was at all times material hereto a resident of Colorado.\nAs a result of a bone infection and bone tumor and related treatment, Ms. Lucas is substantially\nimpaired in several major life activities and requires a wheelchair for mobility.  Ms. Lucas has\nshopped at Kmart stores in various locations in Colorado and other states and plans to continue\nto do so in the near and distant future. \n2.  Plaintiff Debbie L. Lane is and was at all times material hereto a resident of Colorado.\nAs a result of epilepsy and spastic paraparesis, Ms. Lane is substantially impaired in several\nmajor life activities and requires a power wheelchair for mobility.  Ms. Lane has shopped at\nKmart stores in various locations in Colorado and plans to continue to do so in the near and\ndistant future. \n3.  Plaintiff Julie Reiskin is and was at all times material hereto a resident of Colorado.  As a\nresult of multiple sclerosis, Ms. Reiskin is substantially impaired in several major life activities\nand requires a power wheelchair for mobility.  Ms. Reiskin has shopped at Kmart stores in\nvarious locations in Colorado and plans to continue to do so in the near and distant future. \n4.  Defendant Kmart Corporation is a corporation incorporated in Michigan with its principal\nplace of business in Troy, Michigan.  Kmart is registered to do business in the state of Colorado.   \n2\n\nKmart owns and operates over 2,000 large retail stores selling general merchandise throughout\nthe United States.  In 1999, Kmart had almost $36 billion in sales. \n  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS\n1.  Plaintiffs seek to maintain this action as a class action under Rule 23(b)(1) and/or Rule\n23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  The class consists of all persons with\ndisabilities who use wheelchairs or scooters for mobility who have been denied, or are currently\nbeing denied, full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages,\nor accommodations of any public accommodation that was designed or constructed by or is\nowned, operated, or leased by or leased to Kmart anywhere in the United States. \n2.  The class identified in Paragraph 9 is believed to consist of well over 1,000 members, and\njoinder of all of such members in this lawsuit is impracticable.\n3.  There are numerous questions of law and fact common to the class including, though not\nlimited to, the following:\na.  Whether Kmart stores are “public accommodations” under\nthe ADA;\nb.  Whether Kmart stores deny the full and equal enjoyment of\ntheir goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations\nto people who use wheelchairs, in violation of the ADA; \nc.  Whether Kmart is required by the ADA to maintain access\nfor persons who use wheelchairs to its displayed merchandise; \nd.  Whether Kmart is required to maintain access for persons\nwho use wheelchairs to accessible restrooms and dressing rooms; \ne.  Whether Kmart is required by the ADA to maintain open,\naccessible, check-out aisles during store hours; \n3\n\nf.  Whether it would be readily achievable, given Kmart’s\nresources, to bring those Kmart stores built prior to the effective date of\nthe ADA into compliance with the ADA; and\ng.  What measures are legally required to bring Kmart stores\ninto compliance with the ADA.  \n4.  Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the members of the class.  They – like other\nmembers of the class – use wheelchairs for mobility and claim Kmart has violated the ADA by\nfailing to make its stores accessible to people who use wheelchairs.  \n5.  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.  They are all familiar\nwith the requirements of the ADA and committed to ensuring access for people who use\nwheelchairs though enforcement of its provisions.  None of the Plaintiffs has any interest that\nconflicts in any way with the interests of the class.\n6.  In addition, Plaintiffs have retained counsel with extensive experience in litigation,\nincluding class action litigation.  Plaintiffs’ counsel have been found by this Court on two\noccasions to be qualified to represent a class in bringing claims under the ADA.  Two of\nPlaintiffs’ counsel, Timothy Fox and Kevin Williams, are thoroughly familiar with issues\nconcerning people who use wheelchairs because both are tetraplegics and both have used\nwheelchairs for more than 13 years. \n7.  This action may be maintained as a class action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 23(b)(1) because separate actions against Kmart for its violations of the ADA would\ncreate a risk of inconsistent or varying adjudications that would establish incompatible standards\nof conduct for Kmart.  \n8.  This action may be maintained as a class action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 23(b)(2) because Kmart’s violations of the ADA – including but not limited to\ninaccessible aisles, insufficient parking, insufficient accessible check-out aisles and inaccessible\n4\n\nchanging rooms – are applicable to all members of the class.  Therefore, an injunction requiring\ncompliance with the ADA is appropriate.  Declaratory and injunctive relief is the only relief\nsought on behalf of the class.  \nFACTS\n1.  Plaintiff Carrie Lucas often shops at Kmart stores in Colorado and elsewhere.  Her\nexperiences shopping at Kmart stores include but are not limited to those described below.   \n2.  In November or December of 1996,  Plaintiff Lucas went to Kmart store number 4131\nlocated at 200 W. Belleview Avenue in Englewood, Colorado (“the 200 W. Belleview Kmart”)\nto shop.  At that time, Plaintiff’s disability had not progressed to the point where she required a\nwheelchair; rather, at that time, she used crutches to ambulate.  \n3.  When she arrived at the 200 W. Belleview Kmart, she was unable to find any accessible\nparking.  It was snowing at that time.  Because she had no choice, Ms. Lucas parked in the fire\nlane in order to be able to leave her car and access the store.  \n4.  During that visit, Ms. Lucas complained to the manager on duty about the parking\nsituation.  The manager on duty told Ms. Lucas that she would relay her concerns to the\nmanager.\n5.  Ms. Lucas returned to the 200 W. Belleview Kmart several months later and discovered\nthat the problem had not been remedied and that, in fact, only four spaces were designated for\nparking for persons with disabilities in a parking lot of over 400 spaces.  The spaces that were so\ndesignated were not the correct size.  A parking lot of this size should have at least nine\naccessible spaces with at least one van-accessible space of the dimensions required by the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (“ADAAG”). \n6.  During this second visit, Ms. Lucas wrote a note to the manager, Rick Mercurio and\nasked the Kmart employees at the customer service counter to relay the message to him.  The\nemployees stated they would do so.  \n5\n\n7.  Ms. Lucas spoke with Mr. Mercurio soon thereafter.  She explained the problem with the\nparking spaces and Mr. Mercurio said he would look into it.  A few weeks later Ms. Lucas\nreceived a letter from Mr. Mercurio stating that Kmart was looking into the problem and would\ncome into compliance.  She heard nothing further from Mr. Mercurio or Kmart until she\ncontacted the former over a year later in the spring of 1998.  \n8.  Sometime in the spring of 1998, Ms. Lucas again went to the 200 W. Belleview Kmart.\nBy this time, Ms. Lucas’s disability had progressed to the point where she was using a manual\nwheelchair for mobility.  Ms. Lucas attempted to park but was unable to find an accessible\nparking space.  As a result, because she had no choice, she parked in the fire lane in order to be\nable to exit her vehicle.  When she went into the store, she asked to speak with Mr. Mercurio but\nwas told that he was not in the store at the time.  Although she had gone to the store to assess the\nparking situation and contact Mr. Mercurio, she was interested in doing some shopping while she\nwas there.  However, there was a great deal of merchandise in the aisles, making shopping\ndifficult.  As such, she left without buying anything.  \n9.  Ms. Lucas called Mr. Mercurio after this visit to inquire concerning the parking situation.\nMr. Mercurio stated that he believed Kmart had a sufficient number of spaces for the lot. \n10.  Following this conversation, Ms. Lucas filed a complaint with the Department of Justice\n(“DOJ”).  In or about July of 1998, Ms. Lucas received word from the DOJ that her complaint\nwas being referred to mediation.  In October of 1998, she was contacted by Jinu Evan of the Key\nBridge foundation.  Ms. Evan stated that she had spoken with Kmart and that she did not think\nthe issue would need to go to mediation because Kmart appeared to be willing to remedy the\nproblem.  \n11.  Several weeks later, Ms. Evan contacted Ms. Lucas to report that Kmart claimed to have\nremedied the problem.  \n6\n\n12.  On or about November 18, 1998, Ms. Lucas went to the 200 W. Belleview Kmart to\nascertain whether the problem had been remedied.  It had not:  while the proper number of\nspaces were designated for use by persons with disabilities, very few of them were of the\nrequired dimensions.  For example, most did not have any access aisles – necessary for people\nwho use wheelchairs or have other mobility impairments to get out of their cars – and none had a\nvan-accessible aisle.  In addition, some of the spaces did not have correct signage.  \n13.  Ms. Lucas called Ms. Evan and stated that the parking situation at the 200 W. Belleview\nKmart was still out of compliance with the ADA and ADAAG.  \n14.  In approximately late November, 1998, Ms. Evan contacted Ms. Lucas and told her that\nKmart did not want to mediate, so the  Key Bridge Foundation would be sending the complaint\nback to the DOJ.\n15.  On or about November 18, 1998, Ms. Lucas shopped at Kmart store number 7303 at 363\nS. Broadway in Denver, Colorado (“the 363 S. Broadway Kmart”).  When she arrived, the\nhandbaskets were stacked so high that she could not reach them, some of the aisles were blocked\nby merchandise, and no accessible check-out aisles were open.  When Ms. Lucas inquired why\nno such aisle was open, she was told by a Kmart employee that the cashier was on break.  There\nwere other – non-accessible – check-out aisles open at that time.  Finally, the automatic door was\nbroken and the other doors were too heavy for Ms. Lucas to open on her own.  \n16.  On or about November 27, 1998, Ms. Lucas shopped at Kmart store number 4224 at 2150\nS. Monaco Parkway, Denver, Colorado (“the 2150 S. Monaco Kmart”).  On prior occasions\nwhen Ms. Lucas had shopped at this location, no accessible check-out aisles had been open.\nWhen she entered the store on this occasion, one such line was open.  However, by the time she\nhad completed her shopping and was ready to check out, there were no accessible check-out\naisles open.  When she complained to the manager about this situation, she was told that the\ncashier was on break.  There were other, non-accessible, check-out aisles open at that time.  In\n7\n\naddition, throughout the store merchandise was left in aisles, and in other places displayed in the\naisles.  In the clothing sections the racks were too close together.  This impeded Ms. Lucas’s\naccess to merchandise and caused her to knock some clothing off of racks and onto the floor.  \n17.  In or about May, 1999, Ms. Lucas shopped at the 2150 S. Monaco Kmart. Again, when\nshe entered the store an accessible check-out line was open.  And again, by the time she had\ncompleted her shopping and was ready to check out, there were no accessible check-out aisles\nopen though there were other, non-accessible, check-out aisles open at that time.   Ms. Lucas\nwent to the customer service counter to request that an accessible check-out aisle be opened and\nKmart did so. \n18.  On or about August 20, 1999, Ms. Lucas shopped at Kmart store number 3627 at 8500\nW. Crestline Avenue in Littleton (“the 8500 W. Crestline Kmart”).  As she entered the store, Ms.\nLucas noted  that there were two accessible check-out aisles, but that neither of them was open.\nShe paused after she came through the door at which point a Kmart employee at the customer\nservice counter by the name of Jennifer asked Ms. Lucas if she needed help.  As such, Kmart\nwas aware that Ms. Lucas – now using a power wheelchair – was shopping in the store.  \n19.  Ms. Lucas was unable to access parts of the gardening, school supplies, furniture and\nhousehold departments because numerous aisles were blocked by merchandise and other items.\nThe electronics check-out counter was 41 inches high throughout.  The women’s fitting room\nhad no bench and had clothes hooks that were mounted at a height of approximately 60 inches.  \n20.  When Ms. Lucas went to check out, neither of the accessible check-out aisles was open.\nShe got in the shortest inaccessible line but when she reached the front of the line, was unable to\nget through the aisle.  She informed the clerk that she was unable to get through the aisle and that\nthere were no accessible aisles open.  The clerk responded by leaving the aisle – and Ms. Lucas\nand the line of customers behind her.  Several minutes later the store opened another aisle –\nthough still not one of the accessible aisles.  Ms. Lucas continued to wait at the now-abandoned\n8\n\naisle but when the clerk did not return and no accessible aisle opened, she proceeded to the\ncustomer service counter to complain.  The woman by the name of Jennifer – who had initially\nasked Ms. Lucas whether she needed help – made clear that she knew Kmart was required to\nkeep an accessible check-out aisle open but informed Ms. Lucas that the clerk on that aisle was\non break.  \n21.  Ms. Lucas asked to speak with a manager.  She explained the problem to floor manager\nCraig Bass.  Mr. Bass shrugged and offered to help Ms. Lucas at the customer service counter.\nWhile this counter had a lowered portion, it was covered with boxes, notebooks and merchandise\nand, as such, was not usable by Ms. Lucas.  Mr. Bass refused to open an accessible check-out\naisle. \n22.  The 8500 W. Crestline Kmart has approximately 363 total parking spaces, only four of\nwhich are accessible and none of which is wide enough to be van-accessible.  Two of the four\nallegedly accessible spaces do not comply with the requirements of ADAAG.  Two additional\nspaces on the north end of the building are marked as if to be accessible but were blocked by a\nroll-off trash container on the day Ms. Lucas shopped there.  There is, in any event, no curb cut\nto the sidewalk near those two spaces.  \n23.  On or about August 20, 1999, Ms. Lucas shopped at the 200 W. Belleview Kmart.  She\nwas unable to access merchandise in various areas throughout the store because of items\nblocking the aisles.  In addition, the single accessible fitting room was unusable because it was\nfilled with a shopping cart full of merchandise.  The electronics checkout counter was 41 inches\nhigh throughout.  \n24.   On or about August 20, 1999, Ms. Lucas shopped at Kmart store number 4187 located at\n2770 W. Evans Avenue in Denver, Colorado (“the 2770 W. Evans Kmart”).   She was unable to\naccess merchandise in various areas throughout the store because of items blocking the aisles.  In\naddition, the route to the accessible fitting room was blocked so that Ms. Lucas was unable to get\n9\n\nto it.  The electronics checkout counter was 41 inches high throughout.  The women’s restroom\ndid not have an accessible stall.  \n25.  The 2770 W. Evans Kmart has approximately 423 total parking spaces only seven of\nwhich are accessible.  Many of the spaces are improperly marked, causing confusion and often\nleading to the situation in which cars are parked too close to one another for proper access.  \n26.  On or about October 19, 1999, Ms. Lucas was in the Nashville, Tennessee area to attend\nto matters related to the adoption of her daughter.  At that time, she went to Kmart store number\n3716 at 4646 Lebanon Pike in Hermitage, Tennessee.  She needed to get some pictures\ndeveloped and to purchase a few other items.  She had trouble finding an accessible space in\nwhich to park her rented van.  When she attempted to make her purchases, most of the aisles she\nattempted to enter were blocked by merchandise.  Because she was ultimately unable to access\nthe merchandise she had come to purchase, she left without buying anything.  \n27.  On a number of occasions since October, 1999, Ms. Lucas has shopped at the 363 S.\nBroadway Kmart.  On several of these occasions, she was accompanied by her daughter who\nalso uses a wheelchair.  Each time, Ms. Lucas and, at times, her daughter, have encountered\nbarriers, policies and treatment that deny them the full and equal enjoyment of the goods,\nservices, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of the store, including but not\nlimited to:  problems related to parking; aisles obstructed by merchandise; failure to open an\naccessible check-out aisle and/or failure to open a sufficient number of accessible check-out\naisles; failure of store employees to assist in removal of barriers; and rude treatment in response\nto requests for reasonable accommodation.  \n28.  Plaintiff Debbie L. Lane often shops at Kmart stores.  She has shopped at Kmart stores in\nColorado and elsewhere.  Her experiences shopping at Kmart stores include but are not limited to\nthose described below.   \n10\n\n29.  On a number of occasions since October, 1999, Ms. Lane has shopped at Kmart store\nnumber 4181, located at 3325 28th Street in Boulder, Colorado (the “28th Street Kmart”).  On\nmany of the occasions she has shopped at the 28th Street Kmart, Ms. Lane has encountered aisles\nthat are blocked by merchandise.  Because of these barriers to access, she has been unable to get\nto the merchandise on her own and has had to enlist the assistance of a non-disabled friend to\nmove items out of her way or to reach merchandise she was blocked from reaching.  In addition,\non none of the occasions that she has shopped at the 28th Street Kmart has there been an\naccessible check-out aisle open.  On more than one occasion, Ms. Lane has asked store personnel\nto open an accessible check-out aisle.  She has been instructed to use the customer service\ncounter instead.  Although she was able to pay for her merchandise at the customer service\ncounter, this transaction was rendered more difficult because the customer service counter is too\nhigh.  \n30.  Plaintiff Julie Reiskin often shops at Kmart stores in Colorado.  Her experiences\nshopping at Kmart stores include but are not limited to those described below.   \n31.  On at least ten occasions over the past two years, Ms. Reiskin has shopped at the  363 S.\nBroadway Kmart.  On many of those occasions, Ms. Reiskin has encountered barriers, policies\nand treatment that deny her the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities,\nprivileges, advantages, and accommodations of the store, including but not limited to:  aisles\nobstructed by merchandise; display racks situated too close together; failure to open an\naccessible check-out aisle and/or failure to open a sufficient number of accessible check-out\naisles; and designation of the only accessible check-out aisle as limited to patrons buying a\nlimited number of items.  \n32.  On information and belief, Kmart store number 4276, located at 2244 S. Reynolds Road\nin Toledo, Ohio has features that deny the full and equal enjoyment of the store’s goods,\nservices, facilities, privileges, advantages, and/or accommodations to persons who use\n11\n\nwheelchairs or scooters.  These features include but are not limited to the fact that the aisles are\nused to display merchandise and/or to store merchandise prior to stocking the shelves and\nclothing racks are placed too close together.  \n33.  On information and belief, Kmart store number 7230 located at 3316 Denton Highway in\nHaltom City, Texas has features that deny the full and equal enjoyment of the store’s goods,\nservices, facilities, privileges, advantages, and/or accommodations to persons who use\nwheelchairs or scooters.  These features include but are not limited to the fact that the sidewalk\nin front of the store is used to display merchandise, leaving a path that is too narrow to traverse\nin a wheelchair and that objects, including boxes and rolling ladders, are positioned in aisles so\nas to block access to persons in wheelchairs.  In addition, on information and belief, the store\nprovides insufficient wheelchair-accessible parking.  \n34.  On information and belief, Kmart store number 4806 located at 1013 Riley Street in\nFolsom, California has features that deny the full and equal enjoyment of the store’s goods,\nservices, facilities, privileges, advantages, and/or accommodations to persons who use\nwheelchairs or scooters.  These features include but are not limited to the fact that the aisles are\nused to display merchandise and/or to store merchandise prior to stocking the shelves and the\ncustomer service desk does not have a lowered portion.  \n35.  On information and belief, Kmart store number 7579, located at 13450 Maple Road in\nOmaha, Nebraska, has features that deny the full and equal enjoyment of the store’s goods,\nservices, facilities, privileges, advantages, and/or accommodations to persons who use\nwheelchairs or scooters.  These features include but are not limited to the following:  using the\naisles to display merchandise and/or to store merchandise prior to stocking the shelves; dressing\nrooms that are too small and that are blocked by racks of return merchandise; merchandise\ndisplayed on the sidewalk in front of the store, blocking or impeding access to the store; clothing\n12\n\nracks that are placed too close together for a wheelchair to pass; and inaccessible and unusable\nbathrooms.  \n36.  On information and belief, Kmart has over 2,000 stores nationwide, many of which have\nthe same and other features that deny the full and equal enjoyment of their goods, services,\nfacilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations to people who use wheelchairs or scooters\nin violation of the ADA. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF\n(On behalf of Plaintiffs and all others similarly situated\n for violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act)\n1.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 -\n52 above as if fully set forth herein.\n2.  42 U.S.C. § 12182(a) of the ADA provides that: \nNo individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of\ndisability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services,\nfacilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place\nof public accommodation by any person who owns, leases (or\nleases to), or operates a place of public accommodation.\n1.  Kmart owns, operates, leases and/or leases to places of public accommodation. \n2.  42 U.S.C. § 12183(a) of the ADA requires that new construction be readily accessible to\nand usable by persons with disabilities. \n3.  On information and belief, some of the Kmart stores described above were designed and\nconstructed for first occupancy after January 26, 1993 but are not readily accessible to and usable\nby persons with disabilities.  \n4.  Through the actions and architectural barriers described above and other barriers at its\nstores and its failure to provide facilities that are readily accessible to and usable by persons in\nwheelchairs, Defendant Kmart has denied Plaintiff the full and equal enjoyment of its goods,\n13\n\nservices, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations in violation of the Americans with\nDisabilities Act, including but not limited to 42 U.S.C. §§ 12182 and 12183 and its\nimplementing regulations.  \n5.  Plaintiffs and similarly-situated individuals have been damaged and will continue to be\ndamaged by this discrimination as more fully set forth above.  \n6.  Plaintiffs intend to continue to shop at Kmart stores in the near future.  \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF\n(On behalf of named Plaintiffs for violation of the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act)\n1.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 -\n60 above as if fully set forth herein.\n2.  The Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act states, “It is a discriminatory practice and\nunlawful for a person, directly or indirectly, to refuse, withhold from, or deny to an individual or\na group, because of disability, race, creed, color, sex, marital status, national origin, or ancestry,\nthe full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or\naccommodations of a place of public accommodation . . .”  C.R.S. § 24-34-601(2).\n3.  The CADA defines a “place of public accommodation” to include “any place of business\nengaged in any sales to the public and any place offering services, facilities, privileges,\nadvantages, or accommodations to the public, including but not limited to any business offering\nwholesale or retail sales to the public . . .”  C.R.S. § 24-34-601(1).\n4.  Kmart stores are places of public accommodation as defined in the CADA.  \n5.  By maintaining architectural barriers and policies that discriminate against people with\ndisabilities and through the other actions described above, Kmart has, directly and/or indirectly,\nrefused, withheld from, and denied to named Plaintiffs, because of their disabilities, the full and\nequal enjoyment of its goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations. \n14\n\n6.  Named Plaintiffs have been damaged and will continue to be damaged by this\ndiscrimination as more fully set forth above. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray:\n1.  That this Court assume jurisdiction;\n2.  That this Court certify the class described in Paragraph 9 pursuant to Rule 23(b) of the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure and certify Plaintiffs as representatives of that class;  \n3.  That this Court issue an Order declaring Defendant to be in violation of the ADA and the\nCADA;\n4.

That this court award statutory damages of $500 for each instance of discrimination\nexperienced by the named Plaintiffs pursuant to C.R.S. § 24-34-602;\n6.  That this Court award Plaintiffs their reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs; and\n15\n\n7.  That this Court award such additional or alternative relief as may be just, proper and\nequitable.\nRespectfully submitted,\nFOX & ROBERTSON, P.C.\n                                     \nAmy F.

Named Plaintiffs are also filing\nsubstituted versions of Tabs 7, 8 and 14 of the Appendix to their Motion for Class Certification.\nReferences in this Substituted Memorandum to other Tabs are to the Appendix filed with the\noriginal Memorandum in Support of Motion for Class Certification.  \nNamed Plaintiffs bring this case to correct architectural barriers and policies at\nDefendant’s Kmart stores across the country that discriminate against a large number of Kmart\nshoppers who use wheelchairs or scooters.  The putative class seeks an injunction ordering\nKmart Corporation (“Kmart”) to adopt reasonable policies to ensure access for customers who\nuse wheelchairs or scooters and to use its centralized design and construction program to bring\nall of its stores into compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.  42 U.S.C. § 12101 et\n\nseq. (“ADA”).  This case epitomizes the type of action for which Rule 23 was designed, as class-\nwide injunctive relief will be appropriate and manageable to formulate and implement. \nBACKGROUND\nA.   Named Plaintiffs\nCarrie Ann Lucas, Debbie Lane and Julie Reiskin are all busy professional women who\nuse wheelchairs for mobility and who shop at Kmart.  Ms. Lucas is the Access and Testing\nCoordinator of the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition (“CCDC”), a statewide disability rights\norganization.  She is unable to walk due to a bone infection and bone tumor and related treatment\nand uses a power wheelchair for mobility.1  Ms. Lane is the Project Coordinator at CCDC.  She\nis unable to walk due to spastic paraparesis and uses a power wheelchair for mobility.2  Ms.\nReiskin is the Executive Director of CCDC.  She is unable to walk due to multiple sclerosis and\nuses a power wheelchair for mobility.3  \nNamed Plaintiffs seek to represent a class defined as follows:  \nAll persons with disabilities who use wheelchairs or scooters for mobility who\nhave been denied, or are currently being denied, full and equal enjoyment of the\ngoods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any\npublic accommodation that was designed or constructed by or is owned, operated,\nor leased by or leased to Kmart Corporation anywhere in the United States. \nNamed Plaintiffs have all encountered discriminatory barriers, policies, and practices at\nKmart stores, including but not limited to:  obstructions that block passage to and through the\n                                                          \n1 Lucas Dep. at 10:23 - 11:9, 22:19 - 23:5 (Appendix Tab 1).\n2 Lane Decl. ¶¶  2-3 (Appendix Tab 4).\n3 Reiskin Dep. at 93:17 - 93:20 (Appendix Tab 5); Reiskin Decl. ¶ 2 (Appendix Tab 6).\n2\n\nstore, as well as access to merchandise;4 clothing racks placed too close together to permit\nwheelchair passage;5 absence of an open accessible check-out aisle;6 inaccessible fitting rooms;7\nservice counters that were too high;8 and inability to find or use an accessible parking space.9\nEach of these barriers, polices, and practices has the same effect:  it denies customers who use\nwheelchairs or scooters the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges,\nadvantages, and accommodations of Kmart stores.  \nA few examples from Named Plaintiffs’ many experiences illustrate the effect of these\nbarriers.   In her deposition, Ms. Lucas described being on the way to a meeting of her ordination\n                                                          \n4 See, e.g., Lucas Dep. at 122:12 - 123:11, 126:15 - 127:21, 130:14 - 132:12, 138:3 -\n142:25, 244:4 - 249:13, 292:5 - 298:5, 305:2 - 305:25, 311:13 - 315:4, 359:8 - 361:16, 377:11 -\n386:18, 394:10 - 395:4, 420:7 - 439:22, 444:19 - 448:11, 461:2 - 461:5, 475:5 - 476:4, 519:2 -\n528:17, 539:1 - 539:15, 550:9 - 554:13, 570:1 - 571:5, 573:1 - 574:6, 586:4 - 586:11, and Ex. 11\nat P0064, Ex. 16 at P0001-3, P0014-15; Lane Dep. at 236:2 - 238:22, 260:1 - 272:25, 278:2 -\n292:1 and Ex. 19 at P0038-39 (Appendix Tab 3); Reiskin Dep. at 36:1 - 38:4, 40:8 - 43:19, 81:2 -\n81:13.  The pages cited in this brief discuss discrimination that occurred after October, 1997, that\nis, the date two years prior to the filing of the Complaint in this case.  The excerpts from Exhibits\n11, 16 and 19 are photographs taken by Named Plaintiffs of access barriers at Kmart stores.  \n5 See, e.g., Lucas Dep. at 107:2 - 107:25, 110:23 - 112:5, 132:1 - 132:8, 137:3 - 137:10,\n448:14 - 448:24, 503:5 - 505:14, 549:8 - 549:18, 571:24 - 573:13 and Ex. 16 at P0006; Lane\nDep. at 238:23 - 239:10; Reiskin Dep. at 36:1 - 36:10, 78:4 - 79:17, 96:20 - 98:6.\n6 See, e.g., Lucas Dep. at 226:4 - 226:17, 236:13 - 241:10, 254:12 - 256:19, 260:7 - 262:9,\n326:1 - 331:19, 363:11 - 374:17, 394:10 - 397:18, 418:14 - 419:20, 450:20 - 458:14, 555:16 -\n557:17; Lane Dep. at 117:10 - 122:24 and Ex. 19 at P0039; Reiskin Dep. at 15:13 - 17:25, 34:18\n- 34:24, 43:6 - 43:19.\n7 See, e.g., Lucas Dep. at 107:20 - 108:1, 116:2 - 116:24, 442:5 - 443:19, 461:6 - 461:9,\n464:5 - 471:22, 487:1 - 487:4, 505:15 - 505:18 and Ex. 16 at P0009-10; Lane Dep. at 242:10 -\n242:18, 273:3 - 277:18. \n8 See, e.g., Lucas Dep. at 440:9 - 441:17; Lane Dep. at 231:2 - 232:16. \n9 See, e.g., Lucas Dep. at 153:6 - 153:24, 177:4 - 177:21, 258:8 - 259:25, 272:1 - 272:18,\n315:7 - 315:23, 362:12 - 362:19, 402:6 - 418:4, 459:2 - 460:10, 491:1 - 491:25, 497:1 - 502:11,\n564:19 - 568:22; Lane Dep. at 112:2 - 116:24.\n3\n\ncommittee -- she is approved for ordination in the United Church of Christ -- and needing to stop\nquickly to replace her nylons.  She went into the Greeley, Colorado, Kmart and discovered that,\nin the aisle in which nylons were displayed, boxes of stock obstructed her access to this urgent\npurchase.  She tried pushing the boxes out of the way but was unable to do so.  Ultimately, she\nwas not able to buy nylons at Kmart and had to stop at another store on her way to the meeting.10\nMs. Lucas also described the experience of attempting to get to a clearance rack that was located\nin the interior of the girls’ clothing department.  She got past the first two racks but was unable to\nproceed.11  Ms. Reiskin has tried to access aisles at Kmart, only to be forced to turn around, go\ndown an adjacent aisle, and try to access the first aisle from the opposite end.  At times, the aisle\nfloors have been so badly blocked by merchandise stacked on the floor that she could not go\ndown specific aisles even though she needed merchandise from those aisles.12 \nOn a number of occasions when Ms. Lucas went to check out after shopping at Kmart,\nshe found that no accessible check-out aisle was open.  Each time she inquired, she was informed\nthat the clerk staffing the accessible aisle was on break.13  She was often made to wait while the\naccessible check-out aisle was opened.  On at least one of these occasions, she noticed that others\nwho had gotten in line after she had gone to check out were already leaving the store, though the\naccessible check-out aisle had still not been opened.14   On two occasions, Ms. Lane returned to\nher lift-equipped van in the Kmart parking lot only to discover that an unauthorized vehicle was\nparked in the striped access aisle next to her accessible parking space, blocking access to her lift. \n                                                          \n10  Lucas Dep. at 139:10 - 142:25; Lucas Decl. ¶ 9 (Appendix Tab 2).\n11 Lucas Dep. at 168:4 - 170:16.\n12 Reiskin Decl. ¶¶ 9-10.\n13 See, e.g., Lucas Dep. at 236:13 - 241:10, 254:20 - 256:19, 260:7 - 262:9, 326:1 - 329:21,\n337:5 - 338:16, 350:16 - 351:22, 364:14 - 373:23, 395:17 - 397:18, 450:20 - 458:14.\n14 Id. at 262:2 - 262:9.  \n4\n\nOn one occasion, she had to ask a passing customer to back her van out so she could deploy the\nlift, get in, and drive away.15 \nThe three Named Plaintiffs have patronized -- among them -- nine Kmart stores in the\nDenver, Colorado area.  In addition, Ms. Lucas has also patronized Kmart stores in Hermitage,\nTennessee, Sherman and Greenville, Texas, and Wichita and Salina, Kansas; Ms. Reiskin has\npatronized a Kmart store in Durango, Colorado.  At all of these stores, they encountered similar\ndiscriminatory barriers, policies, and practices.16 \nB.  Putative Class Members and Other Customer Witnesses\n                                                          \n15 Lane Dep. at 112:2 - 115:20.\n16 See Lucas Dep. at 84:2 - 85:25 (Greenville, Texas), 106:15 - 117:13 (same), 173:3 -\n173:14 (Hermitage, Tennessee), 540:14 - 540:21 (Sherman and Greenville, Texas and Salina and\nWichita, Kansas), 548:2 - 559:23 (Greenville, Texas), 564:4 - 574:6 (Salina, Kansas), 586:4 -\n586:7 (Wichita, Kansas); Reiskin Dep. at 12:23 - 17:25 (Durango, Colorado).\n5\n\nNamed Plaintiffs have submitted with this motion excerpts of the depositions of 45\nindividuals who have encountered similar access barriers, policies, and practices.  Forty-three of\nthese witnesses are potential class members, that is, people with disabilities who use wheelchairs\nor scooters who have encountered wheelchair access problems at Kmart.  The other two\nwitnesses are friends or relatives of people who use wheelchairs or scooters or others who have\nwitnessed conditions similar to those that impeded Named Plaintiffs in their shopping endeavors\nat Kmart.  (These witnesses and potential class members will be referred to collectively as\n“Customer Witnesses.”)  In total, Named Plaintiffs and Customer Witnesses have experienced\ndiscrimination at 77 Kmart stores in 26 states around the country.1   In addition, Plaintiffs have\ndisclosed to Kmart, pursuant to Rule 26(a)(1), the names of other individuals who have\ninformation concerning access issues at Kmart stores.  The total number of witnesses so\ndisclosed -- including Customer Witnesses -- is at least 83.2\nCustomer Witnesses have testified that they have encountered the same types of\ndiscriminatory barriers, polices, and practices that the Named Plaintiffs have encountered, for\nexample, obstructed aisles and merchandise, clothing racks that were too close together for\nwheelchair passage, and accessible check-out aisles that were closed or unavailable.3  Customer\nWitness testimony shows that these individuals share many other common discriminatory\nexperiences at Kmart stores around the country including, but not limited to, inaccessible fitting\nrooms and restrooms, service counters that are too high, inaccessible parking, and obstructions\n                                                          \n1 Miot Decl. ¶¶ 2-3 (Appendix Tab 14).  \n2 See Miot Decl. ¶ 16 and Exs. 2 - 9.  \n3 See Chart at Tab 7 of the Appendix showing citations to Customer Witness testimony\nrelevant to these three areas.

Once\nthere, he had to line up behind other customers waiting for service -- for example, making returns\nor asking questions -- and was often confronted by a queue line that was too narrow for him to\nenter.  Instead, he would have to unhook part of the queue line and hope “some benevolent\nperson” would let him in.  At the customer service counter -- which was too high -- he would ask\nthat an employee be paged to the obstructed aisle to assist him.  “It was not a dignified process,”\nhe testified.  When he would return to the obstructed aisle to await assistance, typically no\nemployee would show up, requiring him to return to the customer service counter a second time.1\nMr. Fuller also explained two separate problems created by Kmart’s practice of putting\nmerchandise displays in the aisles.  He testified, “Those kind of displays often made it difficult\nfor me to get at any items that would be behind the display that I might need.”2  A second\nproblem arose when he was trying to check out and encountered a display of snack food.  The\nback wheel of his wheelchair caught the corner of the display.  Mr. Fuller testified as to what\ncame next: \nAnd so, of course, you know what happened.  Down went the display,\nspewing across the floor went the potato chips, and here I am wondering what do\nyou do.  Do I now stop and try to round up these 85 packets of potato chips?  Do I\nsay to heck with it, let some poor stock guy who was being paged to meet me\nback in sports deal with it?\nAnd it creates a sense of not just embarrassment.  It’s worse than\nembarrassment because it’s really -- it’s really a sense of helplessness. . . .  [A]nd\nthat strikes at the very issue, I think, that many people with disabilities are trying\nto grapple with today, which is independence, trying to be as independent as we\nreasonably can be.3 \n                                                          \n1 Fuller Dep. at 76:23 - 78:24; see also id. at 78:25 - 80:3.\n2 Id. at 38:6 - 38:12.  \n3 Id. at 40:5 - 40:19; see generally id. at 38:6 -  41:12.  \n\nEllen Davis encountered so many obstructions in the toy department of the Kmart in\nBrooklyn, New York that she ultimately had to station herself “in the one open spot” she and her\nhusband could find while her husband retrieved toys and brought them to her.  She had to go\nthrough the same process to select clothes for her son.  This made her feel “highly frustrated”\nbecause it took away her independence.  She testified that, during that shopping trip:  “I started\nto get upset where I started to cry because I didn’t want my husband picking everything out.  I\nwanted to pick out my kids[’] things on my own and I couldn’t do that.”4  \nThe obstructions in one of the aisles in the Santa Rosa, California, Kmart caused Frances\nMoeller to get stuck.  She testified about the resulting situation:\nI remember getting down one main aisle that looked like it was a good\naisle and getting stuck in the back where I couldn’t turn around to get out.  I\ncouldn’t go right or left.  I was stuck.  I was yelling for help.  No one heard me\nexcept for a customer who came and tried to help move racks that were holding\nall these purses on them to try and help me get out of the department.  Finally, my\nhusband came over and also assisted to get me out of the department.5\nMs. Moeller also testified about one of the consequences of the inaccessible clothing racks.  She\nwas attempting to purchase women’s underwear and was prevented from doing so by the\ncongestion of the racks.  She was unable to find an employee in the department and did not make\na purchase, as she “chose not to have [her] husband looking for [her] underwear.”6  \nJohn Armfield was shopping for shoes in the Newton, Kansas, Kmart.  Because of the\nobstructions in the shoe aisles, he had to rely on his wife to retrieve shoes until he found a pair he\n                                                          \n4 Davis Dep. at 8:23 - 9:21, 12:12 - 13:15.  \n5 Moeller Dep. at 216:24 - 218:22. \n6 Id. at 219:19 - 220:20.  \n9\n\ncould buy.  Although he purchased the shoes, he testified that he is still not sure that they are the\nshoes that he would have purchased had he been able to look at all of the available choices\nhimself.7  \nMargaret Dowling testified that when a rack or merchandise was in her way at the\nAntioch, California, Kmart, she would have to ask an employee to retrieve items.  For example,\nwhen shopping for clothes, she would tell the employee her size and preferred color.  “If they\ndon’t have it,” she testified, “they shout across the racks and say what colors they do have, and I\nask them to bring me that . . . .  It’s humiliating.”8  \nMitchell Logsdon stated that the accessible check-out aisles at the Terre Haute, Indiana,\nKmart were closed about 80% of times she shopped there.9  Although she requested that an\naccessible aisle be opened, Kmart personnel would not do so.  Instead, she had to check out at\nthe customer service counter.  Because that counter had no lowered portion, she had to lift her\npurchases to shoulder height, which was quite painful.  On one occasion, she attempted to\npurchase produce at the customer service counter but was told that she was not allowed to do so,\nbecause that location did not have a scale.  When she asked to have the produce weighed at\nanother location, that request was also denied.  Ultimately, she was unable to purchase the\nproduce she had wanted.10  \nThe manager of a Kmart in Tulsa, Oklahoma told Victoria Haws that, in order to have an\naccessible check-out aisle open when she was ready to check out, she would have to make a\nrequest when she entered the store.  Ms. Haws testified that she did not like this practice:  \n                                                          \n7 Armfield Dep. at 57:14 - 57:25.  \n8 Dowling Dep. at 73:9 - 73:18; 83:3 - 83:23. \n9 Logsdon Dep. at 47:2 - 47:7.\n10 Id. at 33:25 - 41:25.  \n10\n\nI wasn’t really pleased because that again would be me having to ask for\nspecial treatment, and which is really something I don’t like to do.  I want to be\ntreated like I’m a typical person.  I want to go into a store, do my shopping, and\ngo home, and not have to go in and say, Would you please help me with this, or\nCould you please do this for me.11  \nIn addition, Ms. Haws would have to wait in line at the customer service counter to request\nKmart to open an accessible check-out aisle,12 effectively requiring her to wait in two lines while\nnondisabled shoppers only had to wait in one. \nKmart’s lack of access makes people much less independent.  Carol Williams, a member\nof the New Hampshire House of Representatives who uses a wheelchair due to multiple\nsclerosis, shops at a Kmart in Manchester, New Hampshire.  Rep. Williams testified that she\nbegan taking a personal care attendant with her to Kmart in light of the obstacles there, although\nshe shops alone at other stores.  Rep. Williams has a limited number of hours during which her\npersonal care attendant is available to her, and any time spent at Kmart cannot be devoted to\nrequired personal care tasks such as personal hygiene and laundry.13   Similarly, Stacey Berloff, a\ncollege student who shops at a Kmart in Brighton, Massachusetts, testified that, although she\ngenerally does all of her own shopping, she has to take someone -- often her mother -- with her\nto Kmart because of all the trouble Ms. Berloff has had with access.14  Because of the difficulties\nBernadette Mauro encountered shopping in a wheelchair at the Kmart in Laurel, Maryland, she\n                                                          \n11 Haws Dep. at 13:14 - 13:20.  \n12 Id. at 13:4 - 15:1.  \n13 Williams Dep. at 19:1 - 20:22, 62:21 - 64:25.  \n14 Berloff Dep. at 10:16 - 11:14.  \n11\n\nhas had to ask her mother to purchase items at her local Kmart in California and either ship them\nto Ms. Mauro in Maryland or bring them with her when she next traveled to Maryland.15\nIn addition to the evidence supplied by Plaintiffs, Kmart has its own evidence of\ndissatisfaction on the part of its customers with disabilities.  Kmart maintains a toll-free phone\nnumber that customers can call to voice complaints, which Kmart then categorizes by type of\ncomplaint.  Kmart has produced lists of complaints received from August 31, 1998 to late April,\n2001 that its personnel have classified as being related to “handicapped services.”16\nApproximately 259 complaints either relate directly to issues raised in this litigation or, because\nof the summary nature of the data, relate generally to “handicapped services.”  These 259\ncomplaints cover at least 219 Kmart stores in 39 states.  When combined with stores in which\nCustomer Witnesses and Named Plaintiffs have experienced wheelchair access problems, the\ntotal is 289 stores in 42 states.17   \nC.    The Americans with Disabilities Act\nThe ADA was enacted in 1990 “to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate\nfor the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities .”  42 U.S.C.\n§ 12101(b)(1); see also PGA Tour Inc. v. Martin, --- U.S. ---, 69 U.S.L.W. 4367, 4371 (May 29,\n2001) (holding that the ADA provides a “broad mandate” to eliminate discrimination against\npeople with disabilities).  The statute recognizes that “the Nation’s proper goals regarding\nindividuals with disabilities are to assure equality of opportunity, full participation, independent\n                                                          \n15 Mauro Dep. at 24:21 - 26:7, 72:14 - 74:2.  \n16 Morgan Dep. at 10:11 - 11:21, 98:2 - 98:25 & Ex 124 (Appendix Tab 9); Robertson Decl.\nExs. 10 & 11 (Appendix Tab 15).\n17 Miot Decl. ¶ 4-5.

With respect to facilities built before that\ntime but altered in certain ways since that date, the altered portion and -- to a certain extent --\nthe path of travel to the altered portion must be readily accessible to and usable by individuals\nwho use wheelchairs.  § 12183(a)(2).  In facilities built prior to January 26, 1993 and not altered\nsince, Kmart is required to remove architectural barriers where it is “readily achievable” to do so.\n§ 12183(b)(2)(A)(iv).  The question of what is readily achievable turns primarily on the nature\nand cost of the barrier removal and the resources of the public accommodation involved,\nincluding “the overall financial resources of any parent corporation or entity.”  28 C.F.R.\n§ 36.104; see also § 12181(9).  Pursuant to statutory mandate, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”)\npublished Standards for Accessible Design (“Standards”).  See § 12186; 28 C.F.R. pt. 36, app. A. \nTitle III also requires public accommodations “to make reasonable modifications in\npolicies, practices, or procedures” where necessary to provide its goods, services, or facilities to\nindividuals with disabilities, unless the entity can show that the modification would\n“fundamentally alter” the nature of its goods, services, or facilities.  § 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii).  The\nDOJ regulations implementing the ADA require that Kmart “maintain in operable working\ncondition those features of facilities and equipment that are required to be readily accessible to\n                                                          \n18 Unless otherwise noted, all statutory citations are to Title 42 of the United States Code. \n13\n\nand usable by persons with disabilities.”  28 C.F.R. § 36.211.19  The DOJ has interpreted this\nprovision to require that public accommodations “ensure that accessible routes are properly\nmaintained and free of obstructions.”  Preamble to Regulation on Nondiscrimination on The\nBasis of Disability by Public Accommodations and in Commercial Facilities, 28 C.F.R. pt. 36,\napp. B (2000) (“Preamble”) at 638. \nD. Defendant Kmart Corporation\nKmart Corporation sells general merchandise at discount prices in more than 2,100\nKmart stores (including Kmart, Big Kmart and Super Kmart stores) that it owns and operates\nthroughout the United States.20  Kmart claims that 85 percent of the population of the United\nStates shops at its stores each year.21  Kmart’s mission is to be “the discount store of choice for\nlow- and middle-income households.”22  The combination of Kmart’s ubiquity and its low prices\nmakes it an attractive option for consumers with disabilities, many of whom live on fixed\nincomes or otherwise have less disposable income than nondisabled individuals.23 \nKmart’s headquarters is located in Troy, Michigan.  Day-to-day operations of individual\nKmart stores are controlled to a great extent by policies and procedures established at Kmart\nheadquarters.  For example, Kmart policies and practices are set out in the following documents:\n                                                          \n19 The DOJ’s Title III regulations are “entitled to deference.”  Bragdon v.

Rather than\nreproducing the entire Store Operating Policies manual, Named Plaintiffs have\nattached the table of contents from each section of the manual to provide a sense\nof the breadth of topics controlled by Kmart’s company policies.24\n(cid:31) Golden Rods:  Kmart is gradually replacing its Store Operating Policies manual\nwith a new set of policies called “Golden Rods,” which already number over\n1,100 pages.  Both the Store Operating Policies manual and the Golden Rods are\ncurrently operative.25  A letter to all Kmart store managers accompanying the\nGolden Rods states that “it is expected that you Review, Communicate, and\nExecute each of the ‘Golden Rod’ bulletins immediately upon receipt.”26 \n(cid:31) Visual Merchandising Standards Manual:  This manual, provided to all Kmart\nstores, governs the display of clothing at those stores.27  \n(cid:31) Merchandising brochures:  These brochures, varying in length from several\npages to several hundred pages, direct the layout of merchandise in Kmart\nstores.28  Merchandising brochures contain, among other instructions, “plot plans”\nthat describe the arrangement of fixtures on which basic merchandise is to be\ndisplayed.  Although the plot plan for each store may be different, it is created at\nKmart headquarters and sent to the stores with the expectation that each store will\nfollow its plot plan.29  Store managers may not diverge from the centrally-dictated\nfixture layouts without permission from headquarters.

An example of the Weekly Guide for August 20, 2000, is included at\nExhibit 103 to the Ruffing Deposition.31  \n(cid:31) Training Materials:  Kmart headquarters publishes the training materials that are\nused to train all Kmart employees at all stores in the country.  They include\noverviews, such as “Orientation and Customer Service for Team Members,” that\nare distributed to all Kmart employees when they start work at Kmart, and\nposition-specific materials, such as “Check-out Service Team Member Training\nChecklist.”32\nIn addition, design and construction of new Kmart stores and refurbishment of existing\nstores is directed by Kmart headquarters.33\nE.   Barriers to Wheelchair and Scooter Access at Kmart Stores \nMany of the barriers encountered by Named Plaintiffs and Customer Witnesses at Kmart\nstores result from centralized policies and training (or the lack thereof) established at Kmart\nheadquarters.  The discussion below provides several illustrations of this centralized control.  In\n                                                          \n30 Robertson Decl. Ex. 4 at K21399.

Centralized Policies and Training  \nKmart’s corporate policy requires that merchandise be displayed in a fashion that\nobstructs wheelchair access.  For example, most of the Weekly Guides for the second half of the\nyear 2000 dictate that Kmart stores display merchandise in “floor stacks” or “aisle stacks.”34\n“Floor stacks” and “aisle stacks” are stacks of merchandise displayed in aisles adjacent to fixed\nshelving.35  Mr. Ruffing identified the photograph at Exhibit 105 to his deposition as an example\nof an “aisle stack” and testified that if a store had the required merchandise, he would expect to\nsee the required aisle and floor stacks.36  These types of displays have obstructed access to\nmerchandise for Named Plaintiffs and Customer Witnesses.37  As Named Plaintiff Carrie Lucas\nexplains, she took the photograph that Mr. Ruffing identified as Exhibit 105 along with nine\nother photographs of floor stacks in the same store on the same day.  The floor stacks depicted in\nthe photographs prevented her from accessing the merchandise on the shelves behind the\nstacks.38  Thus, Kmart headquarters is dictating to all of its stores that they display merchandise\nin a way that obstructs access for customers in wheelchairs and scooters.    \n                                                          \n34 See Miot Decl. ¶ 7 (listing Weekly Guides produced by Kmart that relate to dates since\nJune 11, 2000 and that require “floor stacks” or “aisle stacks”).\n35 Ruffing Dep. at 129:17 - 131:15 and Ex. 103 at K17617.\n36 Ruffing Dep. at 131:1 - 131:15, 138:17 - 138:25 and Ex. 105. \n37 See, e.g., Lucas Dep. at 126:15 - 126:25, 295:3 - 295:13, 384:8 - 385:1, 444:19 - 448:11;\nReiskin Decl. ¶ 11; Armfield Dep. at 53:5 - 53:24, 172:8 - 174:6; Bach Dep. at 11:4 - 11:20;\nBateman Dep. at 65:9 - 65:14, 67:13 - 67:23, 71:21 - 72:7; Berloff Dep. at 9:23 - 10:6, 13:3 -\n15:23; Deck Dep. at 18:3 - 18:11; Fuller Dep. at 38:1 - 39:12; 50:25 - 53:6; Haws Dep. at 19:20 -\n20:8, 62:12 - 63:6; Laube Dep. at 26:21 - 28:21, 29:17 - 30:7, 40:8 - 40:11, 59:4 - 61:19, 98:10 -\n99:1; Mason Dep. at 23:23 - 24:17; Ryan Dep. at 15:22 - 16:7, 20:6 - 20:16, 34:6 - 35:10;\nVangeri Dep. at 43:5 - 48:21, 89:6 - 90:2. \n38 Lucas Decl. ¶ 10 and Ex. 1.   \n17\n\nKmart’s corporate stocking policy also results in obstructed aisles.  Kmart’s Store\nOperating Policies manual and training manuals -- all prepared at Kmart’s headquarters --\nrequire, as part of the shelf-stocking process (which Kmart calls “replenishment”), that Kmart\nemployees leave pallets and boxes in aisles, often blocking wheelchair and scooter access to\naisles and/or merchandise.39  This policy, called “drop slide fill,” requires the replenishment crew\nto drop pallets of merchandise throughout the salesfloor, take boxes from the pallets and slide\nthem down the various merchandise aisles, and then go from aisle to aisle, filling the shelves\nfrom the boxes.40  In theory, until recently, Kmart policy required that all pallets be off the\nsalesfloor by 9:00 a.m. and that there be no unattended merchandise on the salesfloor after 11:00\na.m.41  As Kmart stores generally open at 7:00 or 8:00 in the morning,42 this policy virtually\nguarantees obstructions in the aisles during several business hours.  More importantly, Kmart’s\nRule 30(b)(6) designee on operations testified that Kmart in fact stocks merchandise throughout\nthe day,43 and Named Plaintiffs and Customer Witnesses confirm that boxes of merchandise\noften remain in the aisles throughout the day, blocking passage by, and/or access to merchandise\nby, customers in wheelchairs and scooters.44\n                                                          \n39 See Robertson Decl.

Early this year, that policy was changed to\nrequire pallets to be removed from the floor by 8:00 a.m. and filling of shelves to be completed\nby 10:00 a.m.  Id. at 239:15 - 240:20.  \n42 See id. at 240:21 - 241:5.\n43 Id. at 61:6 - 61:14, 241:11 - 245:10.\n44 See, e.g., Lucas Dep. at 140:5 - 142:2; Douglass Dep. at 83:2 - 83:11; Haws Dep. at 20:9\n- 21:12; Jessee Dep. at 92:6 - 93:25; Kemper Dep. at 10:20 - 11:12, 12:6 - 13:9; Madden Dep. at\n20:23 - 22:8; Rifkin Dep. at 19:15 - 22:14, 48:18 - 50:4.  \n18\n\nNamed Plaintiffs and Customer Witnesses report that they are frequently obstructed by\nclothing racks that are too close together to permit passage by persons using wheelchairs or\nscooters.   As a result, they are often unable to access clothing that is displayed anywhere other\nthan the outer perimeter of that area.45  This barrier, too, results from centralized Kmart policies,\nincluding the company-wide policy establishing a minimum distance between clothing racks of\n24 inches.46  Most wheelchairs are wider than 24 inches:  Named Plaintiffs’ wheelchairs are all\n26 inches wide;47 and the regulations implementing the ADA recognize that a typical adult-sized\nwheelchair is approximately 26 inches wide.  Standards, Fig. A3.  Although Gary Ruffing,\nKmart’s Rule 30(b)(6) designee on merchandising, claimed that very few aisles in very few\nstores were actually only 24 inches wide,48 it is clear from the experiences of Named Plaintiffs\nand Customer Witnesses that impassable clothing aisles are a common and consistent barrier,\nand it is clear from the Visual Merchandising Standards manual and Mr. Ruffing’s deposition\ntestimony that this type of barrier is anticipated and condoned by centralized Kmart policy.\nIndeed, when Rep. Carol Williams, a Customer Witness, complained to her local Kmart about\nthe inaccessibility of aisles, the manager replied that “that has to come from corporate office.\nEven the floor plan is laid out by the corporate office, we cannot change that on our own.”49\nBarriers to merchandise -- including boxes and displays in aisles and congestion in the\nplacement of clothing racks -- are prohibited by the ADA.  The Standards require a 36-inch-wide\naccessible route adjacent to “[s]helves or display units allowing self-service by customers in\n                                                          \n45 See supra pp. 4, 9-10, note 5 and references cited in Tab 7 of the Appendix. \n46 See Ruffing Dep. at 29:14 - 30:9, 32:5 - 32:18, 151:20 - 152:11 and Robertson Decl. Ex.\n7 (Visual Merchandising Standards manual) at K34825.  \n47 See Lucas Dep. at 13:25 - 14:6; Lane Decl ¶ 2; Reiskin Decl. ¶ 2.\n48 Ruffing Dep. at 29:14 - 29:23.\n49 Williams Dep. at 26:4 - 26:14.  \n19\n\nmercantile occupancies.”  §§ 4.1.3(12)(b) & 4.3.  Where accessible routes are required, they\nmust be maintained.  28 C.F.R. § 36.211.  Finally, Kmart is required to make reasonable\nmodifications in the policies described above to make its goods, services, facilities, privileges,\nadvantages, and accommodations available to individuals with disabilities, if such modifications\nwill not fundamentally alter Kmart’s goods and services.  § 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii). \nKmart’s failure to implement policies and to train its staff to implement existing policies\nalso results in barriers to access.  For example, Named Plaintiffs and Customer Witnesses have\noften found that accessible check-out aisles at Kmart stores are all closed.  This is a violation of\nthe regulations implementing Title III of the ADA, which require that stores have accessible\ncheck-out aisles in numbers relative to the total number of check-out aisles in the store, and that\nthey ensure that “an adequate number of accessible check-out aisles is kept open during store\nhours,” or that “an equivalent level of convenient service is provided to individuals with\ndisabilities as is provided to others.”  Standards § 7.3; 28 C.F.R. § 36.302(d).  As both Named\nPlaintiff and Customer Witness testimony shows, Kmart’s failure to maintain an open, accessible\ncheck-out aisle often introduces a substantial delay and otherwise denies them full and equal\nenjoyment of Kmart’s services.50  Although Kmart’s policy purportedly requires that at least one\naccessible check-out aisle always be open,51 there is no mention of this policy in the materials\nused to train either the employees who staff the check-out aisle or those who supervise them.52  \n                                                          \n50 See supra pp. 4-5, 10-11, note 6 and references cited in Tab 7 of the Appendix.  \n51 See Frame Dep. at 91:4 - 91:24.\n52 See Kaselitz Dep. Ex. 57 at K00134-35, Exs. 73, 78; Robertson Decl. Exs. 12-14.\nAlthough Kmart produced a videotape to be shown in its stores early this year that made\nreference to this issue, Kmart’s Rule 30(b)(6) designee on training testified that Kmart made no\nspecific mention in its training materials of customers in wheelchairs and did not have specific\ntraining to the effect that a customer in a wheelchair should be helped any differently from any\nother customer.  Kaselitz Dep. at 79:14 - 80:3.  \n20\n\nObstructions in accessible parking spaces and the access aisles adjacent to such parking\nspaces at Kmart stores are also due to the lack of policy and/or lack of training and enforcement.\nKmart’s Store Operating Policies state generally that its parking lots are to be “free of debris; no\npotholes, cracks or depressions, stray carts.”53  It was not until early this year, however, that a\nnew Golden Rod was issued that instructed Kmart employees to “[k]eep accessible parking\nspaces and walkways clear and uncluttered, free of carts, debris, delivery trucks and other\nunauthorized vehicles.”54  Despite this new policy, Kmart’s Rule 30(b)(6) designee on store\noperations stated that Kmart would not monitor the use of its accessible parking spaces and\naccess aisles by unauthorized vehicles or install signs to prevent blockage of parking access\naisles.55 \n2. Architectural Barriers.\nNamed Plaintiffs and Customer Witnesses have encountered inaccessible fitting rooms\nand restrooms, service counters that are too high, and insufficient accessible parking.56  These\nbarriers are also under the control of Kmart headquarters.\nKmart has a highly centralized design and construction program.  Kmart headquarters\npublishes “Outline Specifications” and a “Design Requirements Manual” for new Kmart stores.\nThe Outline Specifications for building a Kmart store are 843 pages long; the Design\nRequirements are 71 pages long.57  Kmart expects the architects and engineers it hires to follow\n                                                          \n53 Robertson Decl.

For example, with respect to new construction, Kmart updated its “standard\ncriteria documents . . . to include the requirements of Title III.”  Compliance was checked by a\n“checking team” in the Design and Construction department at Kmart headquarters.  Reference\nto the ADA was included in all standard contracting documents through which Kmart hired\narchitects to build Kmart stores.62 \nWith respect to existing facilities (those built prior to the effective date of the ADA),\nKmart headquarters published an “ADA Action Plan,” which its Rule 30(b)(6) designee on ADA\ncompliance described as “Kmart Corporation’s guidelines for compliance with the Americans\nwith Disabilities Act of 1990.”63   Kmart headquarters ordered and directed ADA surveys of\n                                                          \n58 Glasser Dep. at 132:22 - 133:4.\n59 Id. at 134:14 - 134:18, 168:6 - 168:11 and Ex. 160 at K23794.  \n60 1998 Kmart Fact Book (Robertson Decl.

Customer Witness\nWilliam Fuller testified that he requested the manager of the Winchester, Virginia, Kmart to\nreverse the swing of the hinges on the door to the mens’ fitting room to make it wheelchair-\naccessible.  The manager agreed that “he would discuss it with the powers [that] be” but to Mr.\nFuller’s knowledge, nothing was ever done.  Mr. Fuller testified that he \nhad this sense that even though they wanted to make changes, that they didn’t\nhave the authority or that they needed to seek authority from somebody else.\nTheir powers to impact particularly physical things, the nature of the physical\nplant, appeared to [him] to be real limited.66\nIn addition, despite Kmart’s claimed efforts at compliance, there is evidence that headquarters\npersonnel decided not to implement the ADA Action Plan during the refurbishment of stores.67\nF.   Relief Sought\nNamed Plaintiffs seek an injunction compelling Kmart to bring its stores into compliance\nwith Title III of the ADA.  Because of the centralized nature of Kmart’s operation, such an\ninjunction would focus on the policies, procedures, practices, and training administered by\nKmart’s headquarters.  For example, Named Plaintiffs request that the injunction require Kmart\nto modify its company policies to require sufficient space between clothing racks to permit\nwheelchair access, to prohibit displays of merchandise that obstruct access to aisles or other\n                                                          \n64 Id. at 83:11 - 83:22, 105:11 - 105:24 and Exs. 138, 147, 156 & 158.  \n65 Id. at 97:5 - 97:7.  \n66 Fuller Dep. at 54:21 - 55:15.\n67 See Ex. 146 to Glasser Dep. \n23\n\nmerchandise and otherwise to ensure that aisles and merchandise are unobstructed, to modify its\ntraining procedures to ensure that access is maintained and accessible check-out aisles are open,\nand to require staff to monitor and report unauthorized use of accessible parking spaces.  An\ninjunction could also address architectural issues on a centralized basis, as that is how Kmart\nhandles all construction matters, including those related to compliance with the ADA.  The\nanalysis of any store-specific information -- relating either to architectural or policy matters --\nwill be simplified by the fact that Kmart gathers and analyzes a wide variety of such information\nat the headquarters level to direct the implementation of architectural changes and other policies\nat the store level.  There is, thus, a framework in place for both the determination of liability and\nthe implementation of injunctive relief in this case.  \nA company-wide injunction to bring policies, training and infrastructure into compliance\nwith the ADA would provide access for a far larger number of shoppers in a far more efficient\nfashion than forcing individual shoppers to bring store-by-store actions.  If Plaintiffs are\nsuccessful in this litigation, individuals who use wheelchairs from all parts of the country will\nhave reliable, convenient and independent access to a consistent source of affordable\nmerchandise. \nARGUMENT\nPlaintiffs Are Entitled to Class Certification\nI.    Introduction\nTo maintain a class action, Named Plaintiffs must satisfy the four prerequisites of Rule\n23(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as well as one of the three subsections of Rule\n23(b).  Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition v. Taco Bell Corp., 184 F.R.D. 354, 356 (D. Colo.\n1999); Cook v. Rockwell Int’l Corp., 151 F.R.D. 378, 381 (D. Colo. 1993) (“Cook I”)).  Rule\n23(a) states:\n24\n\nOne or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on\nbehalf of all only if (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is\nimpracticable, (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class, (3) the\nclaims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or\ndefenses of the class, and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately\nprotect the interests of the class.\nNamed Plaintiffs satisfy all of these prerequisites:  there are at least 20,000 and perhaps as many\nas 1.7 million members of the putative class; the barriers experienced by Kmart customers in\nwheelchairs are very similar and the questions whether these barriers and Kmart polices and\npractices constitute violations of the ADA are legal questions common to the class; Named\nPlaintiffs’ experiences and claims are typical of those of the class; and Named Plaintiffs and their\ncounsel have been held by the United States District Court for the District of Colorado to be able\nadequately to represent a class of persons with mobility impairments bringing suit under Title III\nof the ADA.  See Farrar-Kuhn v. Conoco Inc., Civil Action No. 99-WM-2086 (D. Colo. Aug. 22,\n2000) (Appendix Tab 21), slip op. at 6 (approving Carrie Lucas as representative plaintiff and\nAmy Robertson, Timothy Fox and Kevin Williams as class counsel); Taco Bell, 184 F.R.D. at\n361 (approving Julie Reiskin and Debbie Lane as representative plaintiffs and Amy Robertson,\nTimothy Fox and Kevin Williams as class counsel).  \nNamed Plaintiffs seek certification pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) because Kmart has “acted\nor refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final\ninjunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.”\nThe Tenth Circuit has held that “if there is error to be made, let it be made in favor and\nnot against the maintenance of the class action.”  Esplin v. Hirschi, 402 F.2d 94, 99 (10th Cir.\n1968), cert. denied, 394 U.S. 928 (1969); see also Taco Bell, 184 F.R.D. at 356 (citing Esplin).\nIt is inappropriate to pass on the merits of the claims at the class certification stage.

Farrar-Kuhn, slip op. at 2; Fey Concert,\ntranscript at 3-4; Neff, 179 F.R.D. at 192.  \n27\n\n(and cases cited therein) (hereinafter “Newberg”).  Each of these factors shows that joinder is\nimpracticable in the case at hand.\nThe class is large.  In determining class size, the exact number of potential members need\nnot be shown.  See, e.g., Joseph v. General Motors Corp., 109 F.R.D. 635, 639 (D. Colo. 1986).\nRather, the court may make “common sense assumptions” to support a finding that joinder\nwould be impracticable.  Taco Bell, 184 F.R.D. at 358; 1 Newberg § 3.03 at 3-17 & n.58 (and\ncases cited therein).  “Census figures are frequently relied on by courts in determining the size of\nproposed classes.”  Taco Bell, 184 F.R.D. at 358.\nIn the present case, Kmart owns and operates approximately 2,100 stores around the\nUnited States, and approximately 180 million customers patronize these stores each year.70\nCensus figures demonstrate there are more than two million persons age 15 and older in the\nUnited States who use wheelchairs.71  Thus if only one out of 100 persons who use wheelchairs\nin these states patronized a Kmart store, the class would consist of over 20,000 persons.  If, as\nKmart claims, “85 percent of the U.S. population shop[s] at Kmart every year,”72 that suggests\nthat the class would consist of approximately 1.7 million members or 85 percent of the two\nmillion Americans who use wheelchairs. \n                                                          \n70 See 2000 Annual Report at 16; 1999 Kmart Fact Book at 5.  \n71 See “Americans with Disabilities: 1997 - Table 2,” Robertson Decl. Ex. 15.  \n72 2000 Annual Report at 4.  \n28\n\nThe class is geographically diverse.  “The fact that a class is dispersed over several\ncounties weighs in favor of a finding of numerosity.”  Taco Bell, 184 F.R.D. at 358 (citation\nomitted); see also Ambulatory Surgery, 197 F.R.D. at 525 (fact that class members in nationwide\nADA class action were “spread across the United States” supported finding that joinder was\nimpracticable).  In the case at hand, there are Kmart stores in 50 states1 and there are class\nmembers in 50 states.  Indeed, Named Plaintiffs have submitted deposition testimony from\nputative class members who have had access problems at Kmart stores in 26 states; if complaints\nto Kmart are included, the total is 42 states.2 \nFor these reasons, the class is so numerous that joinder is impracticable and thus satisfies\nRule 23(a)(1).\nB.   There Are Questions of Law and Fact Common to the Proposed Class. \nRule 23(a)(2) requires that there be questions of law or fact that are common to the class.\nUnlike the test under Rule 23(b)(3) -- not at issue in this case -- common issues need not\npredominate over individual ones.  Adamson, 855 F.2d at 676.  “Commonality requires only a\nsingle issue common to the class.”  J.B. v. Valdez, 186 F.3d 1280, 1288 (10th Cir. 1999)\n(citations omitted).  “The claims of the class members need not be identical for there to be\ncommonality; either common questions of law or fact will suffice.”   Schwartz v. Celestial\nSeasonings, Inc., 178 F.R.D. 545, 551 (D. Colo. 1998) (citing Milonas v. Williams, 691 F.2d 931,\n938 (10th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1069 (1983)).  “[T]here may be varying fact\nsituations among individual members of the class . . . as long as the claims of the plaintiffs and\nother class members are based on the same legal or remedial theory.”  Joseph, 109 F.R.D. at 639-\n40 (citation omitted).   Indeed, if identical claims were required, “it would be rare, if even\n                                                          \n1 1998 Kmart Fact Book at 12.\n2 Miot Decl. ¶¶ 3, 5.\n29\n\npossible, to obtain class certification.”  Cook v. Rockwell Int’l Corp., 181 F.R.D. 473, 480 (D.\nColo. 1998).   As demonstrated by the attached deposition excerpts, members of the putative class\nin this case share a number of common factual experiences and legal issues that satisfy the\ncommonality requirement of Rule 23(a)(2).\nCommon discriminatory barriers.  Members of the proposed class experience common\nforms of discrimination at Kmart stores around the country, including (though not limited to):\nencountering boxes, pallets, and merchandise displays that impede their access; being unable to\naccess clothing because fixtures are placed too close together to permit passage in a wheelchair;\nfinding no open, accessible check-out aisle at which to purchase merchandise; having difficulty\nusing service counters that are too high; being unable to use fitting rooms or restrooms; and being\nunable to park in an accessible parking space.3 \nA number of cases have held that where people who use wheelchairs encounter the same\ntypes of barriers at a number of commonly-owned or affiliated public accommodations, class\ncertification is appropriate.  See, e.g., Farrar-Kuhn, slip op. at 4-5; Ambulatory Surgery, 197\nF.R.D. at 526-27; AHM, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14788 at *8-12; Taco Bell, 184 F.R.D. at 359-\n60; Arnold, 158 F.R.D. at 449; Leiken, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21281 at *14.  In Farrar-Kuhn, the\nplaintiffs sought certification of a class -- defined almost precisely as the putative class here is\ndefined -- of people who use wheelchairs or scooters who had been denied the full and equal\nenjoyment of goods and services at service stations and convenience stores owned by Conoco Inc.\nPlaintiffs in that case challenged a variety of barriers to wheelchair access at approximately 200\nConoco stores in eleven states.  Slip op. at 1-2.  Judge Miller held that the class satisfied Rule\n23(a)(2) because common questions of fact and law existed, including:\n(1) the class members complain of the same architectural barriers and policies;\n(2) the plaintiffs urge that by these architectural barriers and policies, the defendant\ndiscriminated against all members of the class; and (3) the determination of\n                                                          \n3 See supra pp. 2-12 and Tabs 7 & 8 of the Appendix.  \n30\n\nwhether these barriers and policies violate the ADA is the same whether there is\none plaintiff or a class of plaintiffs.\nSlip op. at 5; see also Arnold, 158 F.R.D. at 449 (holding that “[f]rom the fact that the same\ncategories of design features are being challenged in each [of 70 theaters], it follows that the\nlegality of those features are legal issues common to the claims of the members of all of the\nsubclasses”) (emphasis added); Taco Bell 184 F.R.D. at 359-60 (Plaintiffs challenged the “queue\nlines” at all Taco Bell restaurants in Colorado).  \nLike the plaintiffs in Farrar-Kuhn, Arnold and Taco Bell, Named Plaintiffs here challenge\nthe same categories of design features at all Kmart stores.  Although each Kmart store may be\narranged differently, both Kmart policy -- for example, requiring floor stacks and permitting racks\nas close as 24 inches apart -- and Named Plaintiff and Customer Witness testimony show that the\ndiscriminatory design features and their effects on shoppers who use wheelchairs or scooters are\nextremely consistent.  The fact that a narrow clothing aisle may occur in the northwest corner of\none store but the southeast corner of another or occur between “four-way racks” of tee-shirts in\none store but between “round racks” of jackets in another does not diminish the commonality of\nthe experience (inability to access merchandise in a wheelchair), the commonality of the policy\n(Kmart’s company-wide policy of permitting distances as narrow as 24 inches between clothing\ndisplays), or the commonality of the legal question (whether the ADA requires Kmart to maintain\nsufficient distance between its clothing racks to permit people in wheelchairs to pass).  The same\nanalysis applies to the other design features challenged in this litigation.  \nCommon application of corporate policy and practices.  Where a class challenges\ndiscriminatory policies and practices, commonality is established.  1 Newberg § 3.10 at 3-52 - 53.\nsee also J.B., 186 F.3d at 1288 (holding that the fact “that the claims of individual class members\nmay differ factually should not preclude certification under Rule 23(b)(2) of a claim seeking the\napplication of a common policy” (citations omitted)).  In the present case, Named Plaintiffs\n31\n\nchallenge a number of centralized Kmart policies, for example, the requirement of displaying\nmerchandise in the aisles, the restocking policy that results in obstructed aisles, and the standard\nthat permits as little as 24 inches between racks.  They also challenge common Kmart practices,\nfor example, failing to open accessible check-out aisles, failing adequately to monitor aisles,\nfitting rooms, restrooms and accessible parking for obstructions, and failing to incorporate, in\nKmart corporate training materials, sufficient steps to ensure that employees maintain wheelchair\naccess. \nIn Bacal, a class of plaintiffs with disabilities challenged the practices of a paratransit\nsystem, including that “requests for service made a day in advance are routinely not met;\nrequested rides are not scheduled at the requested times; . . . [and] vehicles are routinely late,\nearly or never arrive for scheduled picks-ups.”  Id., 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6609 at *4.  Despite\nthe multiplicity of individual circumstances this undoubtedly represented, the court held that class\nmembers were all challenging “the same alleged illegal conduct of the defendants, namely, a\nnumber of allegedly routine practices which violate the ADA and affect all . . . paratransit riders.”\nId. at *11.4  Likewise, Named Plaintiffs here challenge routine Kmart practices that violate the\n                                                          \n4 See also Hill v. Amoco Oil Co., No. 97 C 7501, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3082 at *17-18\n(N.D. Ill. Mar. 15, 2001) (Appendix Tab 23) (holding that a class of African-Americans alleging a\npractice of requiring them, but not white customers, to prepay for gasoline satisfied\ncommonality); Siddiqi, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19930 at *16-22 (holding that common questions\nexisted among a class of Deaf and hard of hearing students challenging a university’s policies and\npractices in the provision of sign language interpreters and other accommodations); Thomas\nCounty Branch of the Nat’l Ass’n for the Advancement of Colored People v. City of Thomasville\nSch. Dist., 187 F.R.D. 690, 697 (M.D. Ga. 1999) (holding that common questions existed among\nAfrican American students in school district’s elementary, middle and high schools as well as its\ngifted and special education programs who alleged a variety of policies and practices that\ndiscriminated against them); Hewlett v. Premier Salons Int’l, Inc., 185 F.R.D. 211, 217 (D. Md.\n1997) (holding that common questions existed among class of African-American customers of\nhair salons who alleged a corporate policy of denying services to such customers); Guckenberger,\n957 F. Supp. at 325 (holding that common questions existed where a class of students with\nlearning disabilities alleged that a university’s policies and procedures for accommodations\nviolated the ADA and other antidiscrimination statutes);  Kernan v. Holiday Universal, Inc., No.\nJH90-971, 1990 WL 289505 at *3 (D. Md. Aug. 14, 1990)(Appendix Tab 25) (holding that\n32\n\nADA and that affect all Kmart customers who use wheelchairs or scooters.  Furthermore, where,\nas here, plaintiffs with disabilities allege violations of the ADA at affiliated facilities, it is\nsignificant that Kmart controls the design and construction of Kmart stores and formulated and\nattempted to execute an ADA compliance plan, all at the headquarters level.  See Ambulatory\nSurgery, 197 F.R.D. at 526 (relying, in holding that a class of persons with disabilities satisfied\nthe commonality requirement, on the fact that the defendants “availed themselves of a common\nprogram of construction, design, and building code/ADA review.”).\nFailure to enact or enforce a policy where one is legally required also provides a common\nquestion warranting class certification.  The DOJ has interpreted its regulations to require that\npublic accommodations such as Kmart “ensure that accessible routes are properly maintained and\nfree of obstructions.”  Preamble at 638.   Kmart is specifically required to “ensure that an\nadequate number of accessible check-out aisles is kept open during store hours, or . . . otherwise\nmodify its policies and practices, in order to ensure that an equivalent level of convenient service\nis provided to individuals with disabilities as is provided to others.”  28 C.F.R. § 36.302(d).  The\nlack of clearly enunciated policies and training ensuring access -- for example, the absence from\ncheck-out training materials of reference to the requirement of keeping an accessible check-out\naisle open -- is an issue common to the class.  \nIn Martens v. Smith Barney, Inc., 181 F.R.D. 243 (S.D.N.Y. 1998), a group of female\nemployees sought class certification, challenging “a pattern of discriminatory treatment of women\nthat results in entry barriers, sexual harassment, and glass ceilings, and that traces to a central\nfailure by Smith Barney’s management and human resources department to prevent and remedy\nwidespread discrimination.”  Id. at 259.  Although entry barriers, sexual harassment and glass\nceilings involve a wide variety of individual circumstances, the court held that “[c]lass\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \ncommon questions existed among a class of African-American plaintiffs alleging a policy of\ndiscriminatory denial of spa membership).\n33\n\ncertification [was] appropriate if the claims entail[ed] common issues and the injuries trace[d] to\nthe central employer’s failings.”  Id.5\nCommon legal issues.  Members of the putative class share common legal questions\nincluding, among others:  whether the discriminatory policies, practices and barriers at Kmart\nstores violate the ADA; whether Kmart is required to bring those of its stores built after January\n26, 1993 into full compliance with the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12183(a)(1); whether it is readily\nachievable for Kmart to remove architectural barriers in those stores built before that time and not\naltered in the meantime, § 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv); where discrimination results from Kmart policies\n(such as displaying merchandise in floor stacks, placing unattended boxes in aisles as part of the\nstocking process, or permitting clothing racks as close as 24 inches apart) or practices (such as\nfailing to keep merchandise aisles unobstructed or failing to keep an accessible check-out aisle\nopen) whether modifying such policies or practices would fundamentally alter Kmart’s goods or\nservices, § 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii); and whether Kmart has failed in its obligation to maintain access.\n28 C.F.R. § 36.211.  \nFinally, defenses asserted by Kmart will require company-wide analysis.  As the Arnold\ncourt noted:\n[W]here, as here, plaintiffs challenge conditions at several sites, all owned by a\nsingle corporate defendant, the legal standard applied under the ADA to evaluate\nthe adequacy of the accommodations at each of the respective theaters is one that\nhinges, in part, on various corporation-wide factors such as the availability of\n                                                          \n5 See also Lightbourn, 118 F.3d at 426 (holding that common questions existed where a\nclass of persons with disabilities alleged that county violated the ADA and 29 U.S.C. § 794 by\nfailing to direct local election officials to enforce those statutes); Buycks-Roberson v. Citibank\nFed. Sav. Bank, 162 F.R.D. 322, 330-32 (N.D. Ill. 1995) (holding that common questions existed\nwhere policy that delegated discretion to loan officers permitted systematic discrimination against\nAfrican-American clients); Gomez v. Ill. State Bd. of Educ., 117 F.R.D. 394, 399-400 (N.D. Ill.\n1987) (holding that commonality existed where the plaintiffs alleged “that the defendants have\nviolated federal law because of their failure to promulgate uniform guidelines” with respect to the\nputative class of students). \n34\n\nresources.  These are additional issues of fact and law common among the\nsubclasses.\nArnold, 158 F.R.D. at 449 (citations omitted) (quoted in Taco Bell, 184 F.R.D. at 360).  Kmart\nhas asserted the defense that some of the remedial measures demanded by the plaintiffs will not\nbe “readily achievable,” see Amended Answer to Amended Class Action Complaint at 13, a\nstandard that looks to the resources of the parent company.  28 C.F.R. § 36.104.\nC.  Named Plaintiffs’ Claims Are Typical of the Claims of the Class.\nRule 23(a)(3) requires that the claims of the Named Plaintiffs be typical of those of the\nclass.  The Supreme Court has held that “[t]he commonality and typicality requirements of Rule\n23(a) tend to merge.”  General Tel. Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 157 n.13  (1982).\nFurthermore, “differing fact situations of class members do not defeat typicality under Rule\n23(a)(3) so long as the claims of the class representative and class members are based on the same\nlegal or remedial theory.”  Adamson, 855 F.2d at 676.   This is so even if not all wheelchair-using\nKmart shoppers have encountered discrimination at Kmart.  \nThe mere fact that some class members may not wish to become members of the\nclass or pursue claims against [the defendant] does not indicate that their interests\nare antagonistic to those of the named plaintiffs or the remainder of the class, so\nthat class action treatment would be inappropriate.  Rather, the so-called “satisfied\ncustomers” would be indifferent as to the claims and potential recovery of the\nclass.\nJoseph, 109 F.R.D. at 640 (citation omitted).6\n                                                          \n6 The existence of “satisfied customers” in the class would not defeat other provisions of\nRule 23(a) either.  See, e.g., Hill, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3082 at *18 (holding that the fact that a\ncivil rights class may include individuals who did not actually suffer discrimination does not\ndefeat commonality); Siddiqi, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19930 at *25-26 (holding that the fact that\nsome class members may oppose the class does not defeat class certification as “any equitable\nrelief will not ‘adversely affect’ the rights [of such] class members . . . where the aim of the relief\nis to alleviate the violation, not cause new violations to the rights of deaf and hard of hearing\nstudents.”).\n35\n\nThe court in Taco Bell concluded that the typicality prong was satisfied for reasons\ndirectly applicable to this case:  \nThe plaintiffs here suffer from disabilities which, although not identical, require\nthe use of a wheelchair or scooter for mobility.  Thus, the effect of the disability is\nshared by all class members.  Further, the representative plaintiffs contest the\nlegality of architectural barriers under the same statutes as the class.\n184 F.R.D. at 360.  Similarly, in Ambulatory Surgery, the court held that the proposed\nrepresentatives of a nationwide class of persons with disabilities challenging barriers at various\ntypes of affiliated health care facilities had claims typical of the class because they had\nthe same interests and suffer[ed] the same injuries as the class members in that\nthey are allegedly denied access to the same facilities as the class members and\ndiscriminated against as the result of the continued existence of physical barriers to\naccess.  Furthermore, the representative Plaintiffs, like the class members, seek\ninjunctive relief requiring Defendants to modify each of their facilities, as well as\nbuild new facilities, in compliance with the ADA and the regulations promulgated\nthereunder.\n197 F.R.D. at 528.  Named Plaintiffs all use wheelchairs for mobility and have encountered\ndiscriminatory barriers and policies at Kmart stores.  The effect of these barriers and policies is\nthe same for these individuals as for the class:  it impairs their ability to shop at Kmart, that is, to\nhave “full and equal enjoyment of [Kmart’s] goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or\naccommodations.”  § 12182(a).  Named Plaintiffs and the proposed class challenge these barriers\nunder the same statutes and remedial theories as the class:  they assert that the ADA requires\nKmart to remove its barriers and make reasonable modifications to its policies and practices to\npermit them full and equal enjoyment of Kmart’s goods and services.  See § 12182(a),\n(b)(2)(A)(ii), (iii) & 12183(a).  Named Plaintiffs’ claims satisfy the typicality requirement of Rule\n23(a)(3).  \n36\n\nD.   Named Plaintiffs Will Fairly and Adequately Protect the Interests of the\nClass.\nThe final requirement of Rule 23(a), adequate representation, requires that the\nrepresentative plaintiffs have common interests with the class members and that the representative\nplaintiffs will vigorously prosecute the interests of the class through qualified counsel.  Cook I,\n151 F.R.D. at 386.  Adequate representation is usually presumed in the absence of contrary\nevidence.  Id. (quoting 2 Newberg § 7.24 at 7-80 to -81).\nDefendant does not dispute the adequacy of representation provided by class counsel,1 and\n“[t]his in itself goes a long way to negating [any] argument that the class will be inadequately\nrepresented.”  Schwartz, 178 F.R.D. at 553.\nTo satisfy the adequate representation requirement, “a class representative must be part of\nthe class and ‘possess the same interest and suffer the same injury as the class members.’”\nAmchem, 521 U.S. at 625-26 (citations omitted).  Named Plaintiffs in this case, Carrie Lucas,\nDebbie Lane, and Julie Reiskin, easily meet this standard.\nAll three Named Plaintiffs are part of the class and have suffered the same injury as class\nmembers as all three have disabilities that require them to use wheelchairs for mobility and all\nhave experienced discrimination at Kmart Stores as a result of Defendant’s architectural barriers\nand discriminatory practices and policies.2  All three Named Plaintiffs have lengthy histories of\ndedication to the rights of persons with disabilities, demonstrating that they possess the same\ninterest as class members.  \nMs. Lucas is a graduate of The Iliff School of Theology.  She currently is the Access and\nTesting Coordinator at CCDC and is a member of Disability Ministries, the national committee\n                                                          \n1 See Letter from S. Mintz to A. Robertson (Robertson Decl. Ex. 17).\n2 See supra pp. 2-5.\n37\n\nfor persons with disabilities of the United Church of Christ.  She was a delegate to the National\nDisability Party Convention.  Ms. Lucas’s daughter also uses a wheelchair.  Ms. Lucas has been\nadmitted for enrollment beginning in the fall of this year at the University of Denver College of\nLaw, where she has received a full scholarship -- the Chancellor’s Scholarship -- based on her\ncommitment to public service.3 \nMs. Lane began working for the rights of persons with disabilities more than ten years\nago.  She has been involved with numerous organizations concerned with the rights of persons\nwith disabilities, including the Epilepsy Foundation of Missouri and the Missouri Parents’ Act, an\norganization assisting families of persons with disabilities.  She works at CCDC in the position of\nProject Coordinator.4 \nMs. Reiskin was a member of Connecticut Coalition of Citizens with Disabilities from\n1987 until 1994, and a member of CCDC from 1994 to the present.  While in Connecticut, Ms.\nReiskin also worked with AIDS Project Hartford and supervised a residential treatment program\nat a school for children with emotional and learning disorders.  From December 1996 to the\npresent, Ms. Reiskin has served as the Executive Director of CCDC.5  \nAll three Named Plaintiffs have previously been held by this Court to be adequate\nrepresentatives in class actions brought under Title III of the ADA.  See Farrar-Kuhn, slip op. at 6\n(finding that Ms. Lucas was an adequate class representative); Taco Bell, 184 F.R.D. at 361\n(finding that Ms. Reiskin and Ms. Lane were adequate class representatives).  For these reasons,\nthe proposed class meets the adequacy of representation requirement of Rule 23(a)(4).\nE.   The Proposed Class is Sufficiently Defined to be Administratively Feasible.\n                                                          \n3 Lucas Decl. ¶¶ 2-8.\n4 Lane Decl. ¶¶ 3-4. \n5 Reiskin Decl. ¶¶ 3-7.\n38\n\nAlthough not included in Rule 23, most courts require that, to be certified, a class must be\nsufficiently defined so as to be “‘administratively feasible for the court to determine whether a\nparticular individual is a member.’”  Taco Bell, 158 F.R.D. at 357 (quoting Davoll v. Webb, 160\nF.R.D. 142, 143 (D. Colo. 1995), aff’d 194 F.3d 1116 (10th Cir. 1999)); see also Cook I, 151\nF.R.D. at 382; Joseph, 109 F.R.D. at 638.  “[T]he class does not have to be so ascertainable that\nevery potential member can be identified at the commencement of the action.  If the general\noutlines of the membership of the class are determinable at the outset of the litigation, a class will\nbe deemed to exist.”  Cook I, 151 F.R.D. at 382 (citations omitted).  The class proposed here is\ndefined to include “all individuals with disabilities who use wheelchairs or scooters for mobility”\nwho have suffered discrimination at a Kmart store anywhere in the United States.  This definition\nis administratively feasible, especially in light of the fact that the class demands only classwide\ninjunctive relief.  That is, in ordering Kmart to make its stores more accessible to people who use\nwheelchairs or scooters, this Court will not be required to determine whether any given individual\nis a class member as it might in a case demanding damages or individualized injunctive relief (for\nexample, back-pay or on-the-job accommodations).  Further, because each class member requires\na wheelchair or scooter for mobility, each such person is by definition substantially impaired in\nthe major life activity of walking, and thus there will be no need to conduct an individualized\ninquiry as to whether a class member has a “disability” under the ADA.  See Preamble at 620\n(“[A] person who is paraplegic is substantially limited in the major life activity of walking” and is\nthus disabled under the ADA.).\nThe cases cited above,6 also suggest that classes defined to include individuals who use\nwheelchairs and/or scooters who have suffered discrimination at public accommodations are\nsufficiently well defined.  \n                                                          \n6 See supra notes 77-78. \n39\n\nIII. The Proposed Class Is Proper Under Rule 23(b)(2).\nOnce a class has satisfied all four of the prerequisites of Rule 23(a), it must satisfy one of\nthe subsections of Rule 23(b).  The class proposed herein satisfies Rule 23(b)(2).  \nA class is proper under Rule 23(b)(2) if the party opposing the class “acted or refused to\nact on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief\nor corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole . . .” and the\nrepresentatives are seeking “final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief.”  “Civil\nrights cases against parties charged with unlawful, class-based discrimination are prime\nexamples” of Rule 23(b)(2) classes.  Amchem, 521 U.S. at 614 (quoting Adv. Comm. Notes, 28\nU.S.C. App., p. 697).  A case that seeks “exclusively injunctive relief, alleging class-based\ndiscrimination for noncompliance with federal statutory provisions (the ADA) . . . fits squarely\nwithin the ambit of cases for which Rule 23(b)(2) was created.”  AHM, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS\n14788 at *16; see also Taco Bell, 184 F.R.D. at 361 (holding that “[a] class action in which all\nmembers of the class complain of the identical architectural barrier necessarily involves acts that\nare generally applicable to the class”) (citations omitted); Arnold, 158 F.R.D. at 452 (holding that\nclass alleging violation of Title III of the ADA at 70 commonly-owned movie theaters was a\n“paradigm of the type of action for which the (b)(2) form was created”).\nIn the case at bar, “generally applicable regulations under the ADA govern [Defendant’s]\nvarious operations [and] those generally applicable requirements . . . lead to conditions which are\ngenerally applicable to the plaintiffs as a group.”  Ambulatory Surgery, 197 F.R.D. at 529.  For\nexample, Defendant’s discriminatory policies and practices apply to, and affect, class members in\nthe same way: blocked aisles and narrow passages between clothes racks prevent class members\nfrom independently viewing and selecting merchandise; closed accessible check-out lanes prevent\nclass members from independently purchasing merchandise; and inaccessible fitting rooms,\nrestrooms and parking spaces prevent class members from utilizing these areas.  Certification\n40\n\nunder Rule 23(b)(2) is proper because Kmart has acted in a manner applicable to the entire class,\nmaking appropriate final declaratory and injunctive relief.  It is also proper because the class\nseeks only injunctive and declaratory relief.  \nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons set forth above, Named Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court\ncertify a class defined as follows:  \nAll persons with disabilities who use wheelchairs or scooters for mobility who\nhave been denied, or are currently being denied, full and equal enjoyment of the\ngoods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any public\naccommodation that was designed or constructed by or is owned, operated, or\nleased by or leased to Kmart Corporation anywhere in the United States. \nNamed Plaintiffs further request that they be certified as the representatives of this class and that\nthe attorneys listed below be certified as class counsel.  \nRespectfully Submitted,\nFOX & ROBERTSON, P.C.\n                                                \nAmy F.

      "text": "Case 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS     Document 192     Filed 07/13/2005     Page 1 of 7(cid:10)\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO\nCivil Action No. 99 cv 01923 JLK\nCARRIE ANN LUCAS,\nDEBBIE LANE, and\nJULIE REISKIN, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated,\nPlaintiffs,\nv.\nKMART CORPORATION,\nDefendant.\n__________________________________________________________________\nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION\n__________________________________________________________________\nKANE, J.\nThis wheelchair access disability discrimination case is before me on Plaintiffs’\nMotion for Class Certification.  Plaintiffs’ seek to certify a nationwide class of\nwheelchair users based on allegations of a pattern of discrimination against them in\nKmart stores across the country.  Defendant Kmart Corporation (“Kmart”) objects to\ncertification, principally on grounds that each one Kmart’s 1500 stores is physically\nunique, differing in terms of size, layout, configuration, building structure and\nmerchandise selection as would preclude a finding of commonality necessary for\ncertification.  I am unpersuaded, and grant Plaintiffs’ Motion.\n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS     Document 192     Filed 07/13/2005     Page 2 of 7(cid:10)\nFacts and Procedural History.\nPlaintiffs Carrie Ann Lucas, Debbie Lane and Julie Reiskin are individuals who\ndepend on wheelchairs for their mobility.  They filed this action against Kmart in 1999,\nasserting claims for violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C.\n§§ 12101et seq. and the Colorado Anti Discrimination Act (“CADA”), Colo. Rev. Stat.\n§§ 24 34 601et seq., based on policies and practices they claimed Kmart maintained at\ntheir stores that discriminated against them and the entire class of shoppers who\ndepend on wheelchairs or scooters for their mobility.  Plaintiffs sought injunctive relief\nto correct these centralized policies and practices that created architectural and related\nbarriers and impeded the ability of wheelchair bound shoppers from using or enjoying\naccess to Kmart, and moved for class certification.\nDuring the pendency of the class certification motion, Kmart filed for protection\nunder Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and proceedings ground to a halt as a result\nof the automatic stay triggered by such a filing.  Kmart emerged from bankruptcy in\nMay 2003 with a reorganization plan that called for significant changes in Kmart’s\nbusiness practices.  The automatic stay dissolved, and the question quickly arose as to\nwhether this action could, and should, proceed.\nOver Kmart’s objection that doing so would violate the fresh start and related\nprovisions of the Bankruptcy Code, I granted Plaintiffs’ Motion to Reopen.  The parties\n2\n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS     Document 192     Filed 07/13/2005     Page 3 of 7(cid:10)\nfiled a series of supplemental briefs and related materials updating the case and the\ndiscovery plan, and renewed the Motion for Class Certification. As part of their\nnegotiations, Plaintiffs conceded their CADA claims were discharged upon\nconfirmation of Kmart’s reorganization plan.  The sole remaining claim, then, is\nPlaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief under the ADA.\nDiscussion.\nAfter the reorganization, Kmart continues to operate approximately 1,500 stores\nnationwide.  Plaintiffs contend they and others with disabilities have experienced\nnumerous instances of discriminatory practices, policies, and barriers to access at\nKmart both before and after reorganization, including narrow and obstructed aisles as\nwell as inaccessible checkout aisles, counters, fitting rooms, and parking facilities.  In\naddition to their own testimony, they offer the testimony of others in the putative class\ndescribing instances of similar problems at Kmart stores in other states. (Fuller Dep. at\n51:5 55:25 (June 5, 2001); Mason Dep. at 26:10 27:13 (June 4, 2001); Mauro Dep. at 30:11 \n31:13; Pls.’ Resp. to Def.’s June 6, 2003 Letter at App. 5, 6 (June 16, 2003).)\nLegal Standards for Class Certification.\nIn order to obtain certification as a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 23,\nclass plaintiffs must first demonstrate the prerequisites for class action status –\nnumerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation – exist under\n3\n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS     Document 192     Filed 07/13/2005     Page 4 of 7(cid:10)\nsubparagraph (a), and then demonstrate the action is properly maintainable as a class\naction for any of the reasons identified in paragraph (b). See generally C. Wright, A.\nMiller & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 3d § 1785 (West 2005).  Here,\nPlaintiffs contend the prerequisites for class designation are met, and seek to certify a\nnationwide class of wheelchair users under 23(b)(2).\nBecause of the flexible nature of class certification, courts are to favor the\nprocedure. Esplin v. Hirschi, 402 F.2d 94, 99 (10th Cir. 1968).  As long as the proper\nstandards for class certification under Rule 23 are applied, the decision of whether to\ncertify the class rests soundly in my discretion. Shook v. El Paso County, 386 F.3d 963,\n967 68 (10th Cir. 2004).\nIn ruling on the Motion for Class Certification, I do not evaluate the underlying\nmerits of the claim. Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 177 78 (1974)(rejecting\ncases requiring evaluation of likelihood of success on merits and instead accept the\nsubstantive allegations of the complaint as true.) While I need not blindly rely on\nconclusory allegations parroting Rule 23, I accept the substantive allegations of the\ncomplaint as true. Shook at 968 (citingJ.B v. Valdez, 186 F.3d 1280, 1290 & n. 7 (10th\nCir. 1999)).  “In determining the propriety of a class action, the question is not whether\nthe . . . plaintiffs have stated a cause of action or will prevail on the merits, but rather\nwhether the requirements of Rule 23 are met.”Id. (quotingAnderson v. City of\n4\n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS     Document 192     Filed 07/13/2005     Page 5 of 7(cid:10)\nAlbuquerque, 690 F.2d 796, 799 (10th Cir. 1982));see generally Wright, Miller & Kane,\nsupra, § 1785.\nCertification of Nationwide Class is Appropriate\nUnder these Standards.\nThis case provides a paradigm for class certification under Rule 23(b)(2), where\nthe party opposing the class is alleged to have acted or refused to act on grounds\ngenerally applicable to the class, and the relief sought seeks to compel compliance with\ncivil rights laws in a manner that will inure to the benefit of all members of the putative\nclass. See Wright, Miller & Kane, supra, §§ 1775, 1776.  Indeed, the Advisory\nCommittee Notes to the 1966 amendment adding subparagraph (b)(2) to Rule 23 explain\nthat (b)(2) was intended to reach precisely the type of class proposed in this case:\n“Illustrative are various actions in the civil rights field where a party is charged with\ndiscriminating unlawfully against a class, usually one whose members are incapable of\nspecific enumeration.”Applied in Colorado Cross Disability Coalition v. Taco Bell\nCorp., 184 F.R.D. 354, 361 (D. Colo. 1999)(Babcock, C.J.).\nKmart’s objection that the 23(a) prerequisites of commonality and typicality\ncannot be met entwines the standards for class certification with the merits of the case\nand is rejected.  Specifically, Kmart argues that because there is no centralized control\nover design, access or configuration of Kmart’s 1500 nationwide stores, common legal\n5\n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS     Document 192     Filed 07/13/2005     Page 6 of 7(cid:10)\nand factual questions exist only as to those class members who patronize the same\nindividual store.  The claims of the proposed class representative, under this theory, are\ntypical only of those class members who patronized the same stores as they did.  I\nreject both contentions.  The question of whether Kmart Corporation is liable for\nalleged ADA violations by its member stores is an open question that must be litigated\non its merits.  The fact Kmart denies it has ADA obligations for individual member\nstores will not preclude class certification in a case where that denial is in dispute.\nThe focus of concern in 23(b)(2) certification is whether final injunctive relief\nagainst defendant can and will benefit the class as a whole.   Assuming discovery and\nlitigation of Plaintiffs’ claims can lead to a determination that Kmart Corporation is liable\nfor discriminatory practices of its member stores, the prerequisites of commonality and\ntypicality are met.  Numerosity of the putative class is not reasonably in dispute, and\nthe question whether the proposed representative plaintiffs can fairly and adequately\nrepresent a nationwide class of wheelchair users must be answered in the affirmative.\nSee Colorado Cross Disability Coalition at 361 (where Plaintiffs Julie Reiskin and\nDebbie Lane were deemed adequate to represent a similar class of wheelchair bound\npatrons of Taco Bell restaurants nationwide).  With respect to 23(b)(2), the fact there is\na dispute over the requirement that Kmart acted on grounds generally applicable to the\nclass, or that Kmart is legally able to bind its stores with respect to injunctive relief,\n6\n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS     Document 192     Filed 07/13/2005     Page 7 of 7(cid:10)\ndoes not bar certification. See Wright, Miller & Kane at § 1775, n. 12 (citingDickerson\nv. U.S. Steel Corp., 64 F.R.D. 351, 358 (E.D. ¶. 1974).\nDefendants’ objection regarding representative Plaintiffs’ standing to assert\nclaims on behalf of individuals who patronized other Kmart stores is subsumed by my\ndetermination that the Rule 23(a) prerquisites have been met.  Defendants’ objection\nregarding the “mootness” of claims by class members who patronized stores now\nclosed is irrelevant given the nature of the claims and the relief sought.  Stores no\nlonger in existence will obviously not be bound by an order for injunctive relief, and the\nfact of their closure in no way affects the justiciability of claims seeking injunctive relief\nto remedy discrimination in stores that are open.\nBased on the foregoing, Defendants’ various objections to certification are\nDENIED and Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification is GRANTED.  Plaintiffs Carrie\nAnn Lucas, Debbie Lane and Julie Reiskin are appointed representatives of the\nnationwide class of individuals who shop at Kmart and rely on wheelchairs or motorized\nscooters for their mobility in doing so.\nDated July 13, 2005 s/John L.

The Parties propose to amend the Settlement Agreement to\npermit Kmart to remedy 150 stores during the period between May 8, 2009 and May 8, 2010,\nrather than the 215 stores called for in the Settlement Agreement.  This request is based on\nchanged circumstances -- the current economic crisis and its impact on the retail sector -- and\nwill not undermine the ultimate goal -- or the original timing -- of the Settlement.  \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 258    Filed 06/29/09   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 4\nBACKGROUND\nIn February 2006, following years of litigation of claims under the Americans with\nDisabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12181 - 12189, as well as state law, plaintiffs and Kmart\nagreed to a ground-breaking settlement resolving claims by a nationwide class of Kmart\ncustomers who use wheelchairs or scooters for mobility.  The settlement was preliminarily\napproved by this Court on March 22, 2006, and following notice, the final approval hearing, and\nthe expiration of the period for appeal, the settlement became final on September 8, 2006.  \nUnder the settlement, Kmart agreed (i) to make physical changes to its stores over a\nseven-and-a-half year period to make them more accessible for customers who use wheelchairs\nand scooters; (ii) to revise its policies and training materials with respect to customers who use\nwheelchairs and scooters; and (iii) to pay damages to resolve claims for statutory minimum\ndamages in seven states that provide for such damages.  In return, the class released accessibility\nclaims under the ADA and state laws that incorporate or are parallel to the ADA, including\nclaims for statutory minimum damages, and is enjoined from bringing injunctive or statutory\nminimum damages claims for the seven-and-a-half year remediation period.\nPursuant to the Settlement Agreement, Kmart was required to bring 150 stores into\ncompliance by May 8, 2008, and another 215 during each subsequent twelve-month period. \nSettlement Agreement ¶ 6.13.  By May 8, 2008, Kmart had notified Class Counsel that it had\ncompleted work on 150 stores, and the parties have been working diligently to review\ncompliance and resolve all outstanding issues with respect to those stores.  Miller Decl. ¶ 3.\nKmart recently notified Class Counsel that work had been completed on the 215 stores required\n2\n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 258    Filed 06/29/09   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 4\nto be completed by the May 8, 2009 deadline.  Id. ¶ 4.  Class Counsel, in turn, have been\nreviewing photographs documenting the remediation efforts and have completed review of the\nfirst 150 stores.  These photographs show a very high degree of success in Kmart’s remediation\nefforts.  Decl. of Amy F. Robertson (“Robertson Decl.”) ¶ 3.\nMore than just meeting the previous two deadlines, Kmart personnel have been working\nassiduously with Class Counsel to address questions that have arisen during the survey and\nremediation process, and have -- in the view of Class Counsel -- taken a very enthusiastic and\nproactive approach to the implementation of the Settlement Agreement.  Robertson Decl. ¶ 4.  \nAs Kmart began planning for the May 8, 2009 - May 8, 2010 time period, it faced one of\nthe worst economic environments in recent memory.  As a result of these circumstances, Kmart\nrequested and Plaintiffs agreed that Kmart be required to complete remediation on 150 stores\nduring the next year rather than the required 215.  Perhaps most important, by remedying only\n150 stores during the next year, the ultimate completion date of the settlement will not be\naffected.  This is because when the parties first agreed to the schedule in Paragraph 6.13, Kmart\nhad approximately 1,420 stores.  See Settlement Agreement Ex. 1.  At the original pace in\nParagraph 6.13, remediation would be concluded on May 8, 2014, when Kmart reported on the\ncompletion of the final approximately 195 stores.  Kmart currently has approximately 1,350\nstores, Miller Decl. ¶ 5; even with the requested amendment, the last of these stores will be\nreported complete on May 8, 2014.  There will be no need to extend the Settlement Agreement\npast its anticipated completion.  \n3\n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 258    Filed 06/29/09   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 4\nBecause this matter affects the injunctive class, rather than the damages sub-class, the\nproposed amendment is signed only by the representatives of the former class and this motion is\nbrought by those representatives only.  \nThe Settlement Agreement requires Court approval for any modification.  Id. ¶ 30.  For\nthe reasons set forth above, the Parties respectfully request that this Court approve the\nAmendment to Settlement Agreement attached as Exhibit 1 to this Motion.  \nRespectfully submitted, \nFOX & ROBERTSON, P.C.

Defendant Kmart Corporation (“Kmart”) does not oppose this Motion.  After\nconsidering the plaintiffs’ brief and applicable law, the Court will grant the motion to preliminarily\ncertify a Damages Settlement Sub Class for settlement purposes only under F.R.C.P. 23(a) and\nboth F.R.C.P. 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3).\n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS     Document 218     Filed 03/22/2006     Page 2 of 11(cid:10)\nProcedural History\nIn an order issued on July 13, 2005 (the “2005 Certification Order”), the Court certified a\nclass in this action under F.R.C.P. 23(a) and F.R.C.P. 23(b)(2) consisting of “individuals who\nshop at Kmart and rely on wheelchairs or motorized scooters for their mobility in doing so.”\n2005 Certification Order, 2005 WL 1648182 at *3.  The parties have now reached a settlement in\nthis matter.  Simultaneous with the filing of the motion at issue here, the parties filed a joint\nmotion for preliminary approval of the settlement agreement.  Pursuant to that agreement, in\naddition to substantial injunctive relief, Kmart will pay $13 million ($8 million in cash and $5\nmillion in gift cards) in order to resolve claims for statutory minimum damages1 by members of\nthe class.  Class members who shopped at Kmart Stores in any of the seven states permitting\nstatutory minimum damages    California, Colorado, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon,\nand Texas (the “Statutory Minimum Damages States”)    will be eligible to make a claim for part\nof the $13 million to be provided pursuant to the settlement.2\nThe injunctive relief set forth in the settlement will benefit a “Settlement Class” based on\nthe nationwide class certified by this Court on July 13, 2005.  Not all members of the Settlement\nClass, however, will be eligible for monetary compensation.  Plaintiffs therefore now seek\npreliminary certification for settlement purposes of a Damages Settlement Sub Class defined as all\nSettlement Class Members who, at any time from May 6, 2003 through the term of the settlement\n1 Statutory minimum damages claims are claims under certain state statutes for\ndamages in a certain specified amount that are recoverable without proof of actual damages.\n2 The Agreement does not address or release any claims for actual damages.\n2\n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS     Document 218     Filed 03/22/2006     Page 3 of 11(cid:10)\nagreement, shopped or shop at any Kmart Store or Closed Kmart Store in the Statutory Minimum\nDamages States or who allege that they would have shopped or would shop at one or more\nKmart Stores or Closed Kmart Stores in the Statutory Minimum Damages States but for allegedly\nbeing denied on the basis of disability the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services,\nfacilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of such Kmart Store(s) or Closed Kmart\nStore(s).\nPlaintiffs also propose six individuals to serve as representatives of the Damages\nSettlement Sub Class.  In addition to Carrie Ann Lucas, one of the original named plaintiffs who\nis also a member of the putative Damages Settlement Sub Class, there is at least one proposed\nsub class representative with claims in each of the seven states relevant to the Damages\nSettlement Sub Class.\nLegal Standards for Class Certification\nFor a class to be certified under F.R.C.P. 23, plaintiffs must demonstrate that the\nprerequisites for class action status    numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of\nrepresentation    exist under F.R.C.P. 23(a), and then demonstrate the action is properly\nmaintainable under at least one of the three subsections of F.R.C.P. 23(b).3  See generally C.\nWright, A. Miller & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 3d § 1785 (West 2005).\nHere, plaintiffs seek to certify the Damages Settlement Sub Class under F.R.C.P. 23(a) and both\nF.R.C.P. 23(b)(2) and F.R.C.P. 23(b)(3).\n3 The class must satisfy the requirements of F.R.C.P. 23 even in the settlement\ncontext.  Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 619 20 (1997).\n3\n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS     Document 218     Filed 03/22/2006     Page 4 of 11(cid:10)\nA. The Damages Settlement Sub Class Satisfies F.R.C.P. 23(a).\n1. Numerosity\nUnder F.R.C.P. 23(a), in order to be certified, a proposed class must be “so numerous that\njoinder of all members is impracticable.”  The proposed sub class contains several thousand\nmembers and therefore satisfies the numerosity requirement.  See, e.g., Owner Operator Ind.\nDrivers Ass’n v. C.R. England, Inc., 2005 WL 2098919, at *2 (D. Utah Aug. 29, 2005);\nVaszlavik v. Storage Tech. Corp., 183 F.R.D. 264, 270 (D. Colo. 1998).\n2. Commonality\nCommonality exists where there are “questions of law or fact common to the class.”\nF.R.C.P. 23(a)(2).  “Commonality requires only a single issue common to the class.”  J.B. v.\nValdez, 186 F.3d 1280, 1288 (10th Cir. 1999).  “[T]here may be varying fact situations among\nindividual members of the class . . . as long as the claims of the plaintiffs and other class members\nare based on the same legal or remedial theory.”  Joseph v. Gen. Motors Corp., 109 F.R.D. 634,\n639 40 (D. Colo. 1986).\nThe Damages Settlement Sub Class meets this requirement.  The liability theory for the\nDamages Settlement Sub Class is almost identical to that of the class certified by the Court last\nJuly    class members encountered barriers at Kmart Stores that hindered their access to the\nstores.  My determination in the 2005 Certification Order that the commonality requirement was\nmet with respect to the original class supports a parallel holding here with respect to the Damages\nSettlement Sub Class.\n4\n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS     Document 218     Filed 03/22/2006     Page 5 of 11(cid:10)\nIn addition, numerous courts have held that where people who use wheelchairs or scooters\nencounter the same types of barriers at a number of commonly owned public accommodations,\nthe commonality requirement for class certification is met.  See, e.g., Moeller v. Taco Bell Corp.,\n220 F.R.D. 604, 609 (N.D. Cal. 2004); Access Now, Inc. v. Ambulatory Surgery Center Grp.,\n197 F.R.D. 522, 525 (S.D. Fla. 2000); Colorado Cross Disability Coalition v. Taco Bell Corp.,\n184 F.R.D. 354, 358 (D. Colo. 1999); Arnold v. United Artists Theatre Circuit, Inc., 158 F.R.D.\n439, 449 (N.D. Cal. 1994).  Commonality is also established by the fact that Sub Class members\nchallenge a number of system wide Kmart policies    including policies concerning store operation\nand design, as well employee training policies    that they allege are discriminatory.  See, e.g., 1\nRobert Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions, § 3:10 at 3 52  53 (4th ed. 2002); Armstrong v.\nDavis, 275 F.3d 849, 868 (9th Cir. 2001).\n3. Typicality\nUnder the typicality requirement of F.R.C.P. 23(a)(3), the “claims or defenses of the\nrepresentative parties [must be] typical of the claims or defenses of the class.”  “[D]iffering fact\nsituations of class members do not defeat typicality under Rule 23(a)(3) so long as the claims of\nthe class representative and class members are based on the same legal or remedial theory.”\nAdamson v. Bowen, 855 F.2d 668, 676 (10th Cir. 1988).  The proposed Damages Settlement\nSub Class satisfies this requirement.\nThe “legal and remedial theory” behind the Damages Settlement Sub Class is that the sub \nclass members are individuals who use wheelchairs or scooters for mobility, who encountered\nbarriers at Kmart Stores, and who are therefore entitled to statutory minimum damages.  Each of\n5\n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS     Document 218     Filed 03/22/2006     Page 6 of 11(cid:10)\nthe proposed representatives of the Damages Settlement Sub Class have these very claims and as\nsuch the typicality requirement is met.\n4. Adequacy of Representation\nUnder the final requirement of F.R.C.P. 23(a), in order for a class to be certified, the class\nrepresentatives must have common interests with the class members and be represented through\nqualified counsel.  Cook v. Rockwell Int’l Corp., 151 F.R.D. 378, 386 (D. Colo. 1993). To satisfy\nthe adequate representation requirement, “a class representative must be part of the class and\npossess the same interest and suffer the same injury as the class members.”  Amchem Prods., Inc.\nv. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 625 26 (1997) (internal citations omitted).  The proposed Damages\nSettlement Sub Class Representatives clearly meet this standard here.  All six of them have\ndisabilities that require them to use wheelchairs and/or scooters for mobility and all allege that\nthey have encountered barriers at Kmart Stores in states providing for statutory minimum\ndamages.\nIn addition, counsel for the sub class, Fox & Robertson, P.C., specializes in representing\nindividuals with disabilities and has extensive experience doing so both before this Court and\nelsewhere.  (See Robertson Decl. at ¶¶ 2 3.)  Notwithstanding the extensive disputes between the\nparties over the certification of the original class in this lawsuit, the quality of representation\nprovided by Fox & Robertson, P.C. has never been disputed.\nB. The Damages Settlement Sub Class Satisfies F.R.C.P. 23(b)(2).\nIn the Certification Order, the Court certified the nationwide class in this action under\nF.R.C.P. 23(b)(2), which permits class certification where a defendant has “acted or refused to act\n6\n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS     Document 218     Filed 03/22/2006     Page 7 of 11(cid:10)\non grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or\ncorresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole . . . .”  The proposed\nDamages Settlement Sub Class is simply a sub group of the members of the class that the Court\nhas already certified.  The sub class members seek, and as part of the settlement will get, the same\ninjunctive relief sought by the members of the main class.  The only difference is that they will also\nbe eligible for compensation for statutory minimum damages claims.\nThe fact that members of the class will also be eligible for statutory minimum damages,\nhowever, does not mean that certification under F.R.C.P. 23(b)(2) is not permitted.  Case law in\nthe ADA context, including from Judge Babcock of this Court, provides that a class seeking both\ninjunctive relief and statutory minimum damages can be certified under F.R.C.P. 23(b)(2).  See\nArnold, 158 F.R.D. at 452 53; Taco Bell, 184 F.R.D. at 361; Moeller, 220 F.R.D. at 613\n(certification under F.R.C.P. 23(b)(2) appropriate when class is seeking substantial injunctive\nrelief and “only the statutory minimum of damages under [California’s] Unruh Act”).  In reaching\nthat conclusion in Taco Bell, Judge Babcock explained that when, as here, the plaintiff’s “primary\nclaim is for injunctive relief,” “the fact that the class also seeks monetary relief damages [does\nnot] change th[e] result” that certification under F.R.C.P. 23(b)(2) is appropriate.  184 F.R.D. at\n361.\nWhen the claims of the Damages Settlement Sub Class Members are analyzed in terms of\nthe overall relief they are seeking (and receiving under the settlement), their claims for injunctive\nrelief predominate over the claims for statutory minimum damages.  The claims for injunctive\nrelief seek modifications of all the stores in the Kmart chain nationwide, along with substantial\n7\n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS     Document 218     Filed 03/22/2006     Page 8 of 11(cid:10)\nalterations to Kmart’s policies and procedures.  See Moeller, 220 F.R.D. at 613 (injunctive issues\npredominate when class seeks both injunction requiring retrofitting of chain of restaurants and\nstatutory minimum damages under California law).  Indeed, the injunctive claims in this action\nwere actively pursued on behalf of the members of the main class    which includes every member\nof the proposed sub class    for a several year period when damages claims were not even part of\nthis litigation.  Even now, the settlement only addresses statutory minimum damages, not actual\ndamages.  Under such circumstances, it cannot be disputed that this litigation has been\npredominantly about injunctive relief and not the pursuit of damages.  Moreover, because the\nparties have agreed to an extensive notice program and class members will be provided the\nopportunity to opt out, concerns that might otherwise be present when certifying a class under\nF.R.C.P. 23(b)(2) are not present here.  Certification of the Damages Settlement Sub Class under\nF.R.C.P. 23(b)(2) is therefore appropriate.\nC. The Damages Settlement Sub Class Satisfies F.R.C.P. 23(b)(3).\nThe Damages Settlement Sub Class also satisfies the requirements of F.R.C.P. 23(b)(3).\nUnder F.R.C.P. 23(b)(3), a class can be certified if the Court finds “that [(1)] the questions of law\nor fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only\nindividual members, and [(2)] that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair\nand efficient adjudication of the controversy.”\nIn determining whether these two requirements are met, F.R.C.P. 23(b)(3) sets forth four\nfactors that may be pertinent:\n8\n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS     Document 218     Filed 03/22/2006     Page 9 of 11(cid:10)\n(A) the interest of members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution or\ndefense of separate actions; (B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the\ncontroversy already commenced by or against members of the class; (C) the desirability or\nundesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum; (D) the\ndifficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a class action.\nThe requirements set forth in F.R.C.P. 23(b)(3) are satisfied here.\nFirst, under the case law, when a class (here, a sub class) of individuals with disabilities\nseeks statutory minimum damages for alleged discrimination based on architectural or other\nbarriers, the factual and legal issues common to the class predominate over any individual issues.\nIn Taco Bell, 184 F.R.D. at 361 63, Judge Babcock held that a class of individuals who use\nwheelchairs and were seeking both injunctive relief and statutory minimum damages could be\ncertified pursuant to either F.R.C.P. 23(b)(2) or F.R.C.P. 23(b)(3).  Judge Babcock held that\ncertification under F.R.C.P. 23(b)(3) was appropriate because, while there were various questions\nconcerning the defendant’s possible liability that were common to the class, the only issue\nindividual to each class member was “the number of instances of discrimination encountered by\neach class member.”  Id. at 362.  Other courts have reached the similar conclusions in related\ncircumstances.  See, e.g., Moeller, 220 F.R.D. at 612 13; Arnold, 158 F.R.D. at 453.\nSecond, class certification for settlement purposes only is appropriate here because a\n“class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the\ncontroversy.”  F.R.C.P. 23(b)(3).  As a preliminary matter, the threshold set by this requirement is\nlower in the settlement context, because concerns that might exist about the management of the\ncase in the form of a class action have no relevance in the context of a class certification for\nsettlement purposes only.  See, e.g., Amchem, 521 U.S. at 619; F.R.C.P. 23(b)(3)(D).\n9\n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS     Document 218     Filed 03/22/2006     Page 10 of 11(cid:10)\nIn any regard, this requirement is met here because the amounts at stake for an individual  \n  as little as fifty dollars and only rarely over eight thousand dollars    are small enough to render\nmost individual suits impractical.  See Taco Bell, 184 F.R.D. at 362; F.R.C.P. 23(b)(3)(A).  The\nimpracticality of individual suits is confirmed at least in part by the general lack of similar\nlitigation commenced against Kmart on an individual basis.  See F.R.C.P. 23(b)(3)(B).  Finally,\nthe “desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular\nforum,” F.R.C.P. 23(b)(3)(C), also argues in favor of certifying the sub class for settlement\npurposes here.  Because of the pre existence of the main class and the limited size of the potential\nfinancial recovery from bringing individual suits, it is desirable to concentrate the settlement of\nclaims for statutory minimum damages in a particular forum, indeed, this particular forum.  See\nTaco Bell, 184 F.R.D. at 362.\n*          *          *          *          *\nBased on the foregoing, Plaintiffs’ Unopposed Motion for Preliminary Certification of a\nDamages Sub Class for Settlement Purposes Only is GRANTED.  Plaintiffs Carrie Ann Lucas,\nEdward Muegge, Robert Geyer, Stacy Berloff, Jean Ryan and Jan Campbell are appointed\nrepresentatives of a sub class consisting of all Settlement Class Members who, at any time from\nMay 6, 2003 through the Term of the Settlement Agreement, shopped or shop at any Kmart Store\nor Closed Kmart Store in the Statutory Minimum Damages States or who allege that they would\nhave shopped or would shop at one or more Kmart Stores or Closed Kmart Stores in the\nStatutory Minimum Damages States but for allegedly being denied on the basis of disability the\nfull and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or\n10\n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS     Document 218     Filed 03/22/2006     Page 11 of 11(cid:10)\naccommodations of such Kmart Store(s) or Closed Kmart Store(s).  The sub class is certified\nunder F.R.C.P. 23(a) and both F.R.C.P. 23(b)(2) and F.R.C.P. 23(b)(3).\nDated: March 22, 2006\nBY THE COURT:\n S/John L. Kane\nSENIOR U.S. DISTRICT COURT JUDGE\n11",

An Amended Class Action\nComplaint was filed in May 2000.  \n2. On July 13, 2005, this Court certified a nationwide class of Kmart shoppers who\nuse wheelchairs or scooters who had claims for injunctive relief under Title III of the ADA.  42\nU.S.C. § 12181 et. seq. \n3. On February 9, 2006, the parties to this case reached a settlement that resolved not\nonly the ADA claims of the class as certified, but claims for statutory minimum damages of class\nmembers who had shopped at Kmart stores in seven states with statutes providing for such\ndamages.  \n4. Through this Second Amended Class Action Complaint, Plaintiffs allege claims\non behalf of class members in the seven Statutory Minimum Damages States (defined below),\nand request the Court to certify a Damages Settlement Sub-Class and appoint representative\nplaintiffs and class counsel therefor.  \n-2-\n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 220    Filed 03/22/06   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 30\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS     Document 213     Filed 03/13/2006     Page 3 of 30(cid:10)\nJURISDICTION\n5.

Kmart owns and operates over 1,400 large retail stores selling general merchandise\nthroughout the United States.  \n  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS\n16. This Court has certified a nationwide class consisting of individuals who shop at\nKmart and rely on wheelchairs or motorized scooters for their mobility in doing so, and\nappointed Plaintiffs Carrie Ann Lucas, Debbie L. Lane and Julie Reiskin as representative\nplaintiffs. \n17. Plaintiffs also seek to maintain a sub-class to address the damages claims of class\nmembers in seven states.  This “Damages Settlement Sub-Class”will consist of all class members\nwho -- at any time from May 6, 2003 through the term of the settlement agreement reached\namong the parties -- shopped or shop at any Kmart store in California, Colorado, Hawai’i,\nMassachusetts, New York, Oregon or Texas (the “Statutory Minimum Damages States”) or who\nallege that they would have shopped or would shop at one or more Kmart stores in the Statutory\nMinimum Damages States but for allegedly being denied on the basis of disability the full and\nequal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of\nsuch store.  Members of the Damages Settlement Sub-Class seek damages only in the statutory\nminimum amounts available under the relevant statutes of the Statutory Minimum Damages\nStates.  \n18. Plaintiffs seek to have this Court appoint Carrie Ann Lucas,  Edward Muegge,\nRobert G. Geyer, Stacy Berloff, Jean Ryan, and Jan Campbell as representatives of the Damages\nSettlement Sub-Class.  \n-5-\n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 220    Filed 03/22/06   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 30\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS     Document 213     Filed 03/13/2006     Page 6 of 30(cid:10)\n19. The class and sub-class identified in Paragraphs 16 and 17 are both believed to\nconsist of well over 100,000 members, and joinder of all of such members in this lawsuit is\nimpracticable.\n20. There are numerous questions of law and fact common to the class and sub-class\nincluding, though not limited to, the following:\na. Whether Kmart stores are “public accommodations” under the ADA;\nb. Whether Kmart stores deny the full and equal enjoyment of their goods,\nservices, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations to people\nwho use wheelchairs, in violation of the ADA; \nc. Whether Kmart is required by the ADA to maintain access for persons\nwho use wheelchairs to its displayed merchandise; \nd. Whether Kmart is required to maintain access for persons who use\nwheelchairs to accessible restrooms and dressing rooms; \ne. Whether Kmart is required by the ADA to maintain open, accessible,\ncheck-out aisles during store hours; \nf. What measures are legally required to bring Kmart stores into compliance\nwith the ADA; and  \ng. Whether Kmart’s conduct violated statutes the Statutory Minimum\nDamages States prohibiting disability discrimination in stores such as\nKmart’s.\n-6-\n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 220    Filed 03/22/06   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 30\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS     Document 213     Filed 03/13/2006     Page 7 of 30(cid:10)\n21. Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the members of the class and sub-\nclass.  They – like other members of the class and sub-class – use wheelchairs for mobility and\nclaim Kmart has violated the ADA and state law in the Statutory Minimum Damages States by\nfailing to make its stores accessible to people who use wheelchairs.  At least one representative\nplaintiff has shopped in a Kmart store in each of the Statutory Minimum Damages States within\nthe class period.  \n22. Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class and sub-class. \nThey are all familiar with the requirements of the ADA -- and putative representative plaintiffs in\nthe Damages Settlement Sub-Class are all familiar with the requirements of the state laws in the\nStatutory Minimum Damages States in which they have patronized Kmart stores -- and all are\ncommitted to ensuring access for people who use wheelchairs though enforcement of its\nprovisions.  None of the Plaintiffs has any interest that conflicts in any way with the interests of\nthe class and sub-class.\n23. In addition, Plaintiffs have retained counsel with extensive experience in\nlitigation, including class action litigation.  Two of the entities representing Plaintiffs -- Fox &\nRobertson and the Colorado Cross Disability Coalition -- have been found by this Court on two\nother occasions to be qualified to represent a class in bringing claims under the ADA.  Additional\nclass counsel include attorneys with extensive experience in civil rights class actions.  Two of\nPlaintiffs’ counsel, Timothy Fox and Kevin Williams, are thoroughly familiar with issues\nconcerning people who use wheelchairs because both are tetraplegics and both have used\nwheelchairs for approximately 20 years.  \n-7-\n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 220    Filed 03/22/06   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 30\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS     Document 213     Filed 03/13/2006     Page 8 of 30(cid:10)\n24. Certification of both the class and the Damages Settlement Sub-Class is\nappropriate under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) because Kmart’s violations of the\nADA – including but not limited to inaccessible aisles, insufficient parking, insufficient\naccessible check-out aisles and inaccessible changing rooms – are applicable to all members of\nthe class.  Therefore, an injunction requiring compliance with the ADA is appropriate.\nFurthermore, because members of the Damages Settlement Sub-Class seek damages only in the\nstatutory minimum amounts available under the relevant statutes of the Statutory Minimum\nDamages States, the injunctive relief sought in this case predominates over damages, making\nRule 23(b)(2) certification appropriate for the Damages Settlement Sub-Class as well.  \n25. Certification of the Damages Settlement Sub-Class is also appropriate under Rule\n23(b)(3).  Questions of law or fact common to the sub-class -- including but not limited to those\nrecited above -- predominate over any questions affecting only individual class members and the\nclass action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the\ncontroversy.  \nFACTS\n26. Plaintiff Carrie Lucas often shops at Kmart stores in Colorado and elsewhere. \nWhen she has shopped at Kmart stores -- including but not limited to visits since May 6, 2003 --\nshe has encountered a number of barriers that have prevented her from full and equal enjoyment\nof Kmart goods and services based on her disability.  Such barriers include but are not limited to\nthose discussed below.  \n-8-\n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 220    Filed 03/22/06   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 30\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS     Document 213     Filed 03/13/2006     Page 9 of 30(cid:10)\n27. In November or December of 1996,  Plaintiff Lucas went to Kmart store number\n4131 located at 200 W. Belleview Avenue in Englewood, Colorado (“the 200 W. Belleview\nKmart”) to shop.  At that time, Plaintiff’s disability had not progressed to the point where she\nrequired a wheelchair; rather, at that time, she used crutches to ambulate.  \n28. When she arrived at the 200 W. Belleview Kmart, she was unable to find any\naccessible parking.  It was snowing at that time.  Because she had no choice, Ms. Lucas parked in\nthe fire lane in order to be able to leave her car and access the store.  \n29. During that visit, Ms. Lucas complained to the manager on duty about the parking\nsituation.  The manager on duty told Ms. Lucas that she would relay her concerns to the manager.\n30. Ms. Lucas returned to the 200 W. Belleview Kmart several months later and\ndiscovered that the problem had not been remedied and that, in fact, only four spaces were\ndesignated for parking for persons with disabilities in a parking lot of over 400 spaces.  The\nspaces that were so designated were not the correct size.  A parking lot of this size should have at\nleast nine accessible spaces with at least one van-accessible space of the dimensions required by\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (“ADAAG”). \n31. During this second visit, Ms. Lucas wrote a note to the manager, Rick Mercurio\nand asked the Kmart employees at the customer service counter to relay the message to him.  The\nemployees stated they would do so.  \n32. Ms. Lucas spoke with Mr. Mercurio soon thereafter.  She explained the problem\nwith the parking spaces and Mr. Mercurio said he would look into it.  A few weeks later Ms.\nLucas received a letter from Mr. Mercurio stating that Kmart was looking into the problem and\n-9-\n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 220    Filed 03/22/06   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS     Docume 3n0t 213     Filed 03/13/2006     Page 10 of 30(cid:10)\nwould come into compliance.  She heard nothing further from Mr. Mercurio or Kmart until she\ncontacted the former over a year later in the spring of 1998.  \n33. Sometime in the spring of 1998, Ms. Lucas again went to the 200 W. Belleview\nKmart.  By this time, Ms. Lucas’s disability had progressed to the point where she was using a\nmanual wheelchair for mobility.  Ms. Lucas attempted to park but was unable to find an\naccessible parking space.  As a result, because she had no choice, she parked in the fire lane in\norder to be able to exit her vehicle.  When she went into the store, she asked to speak with Mr.\nMercurio but was told that he was not in the store at the time.  Although she had gone to the store\nto assess the parking situation and contact Mr. Mercurio, she was interested in doing some\nshopping while she was there.  However, there was a great deal of merchandise in the aisles,\nmaking shopping difficult.  As such, she left without buying anything.  \n34. Ms. Lucas called Mr. Mercurio after this visit to inquire concerning the parking\nsituation.  Mr. Mercurio stated that he believed Kmart had a sufficient number of spaces for the\nlot. \n35. Following this conversation, Ms. Lucas filed a complaint with the Department of\nJustice (“DOJ”).  In or about July of 1998, Ms. Lucas received word from the DOJ that her\ncomplaint was being referred to mediation.  In October of 1998, she was contacted by Jinu Evan\nof the Key Bridge foundation.  Ms. Evan stated that she had spoken with Kmart and that she did\nnot think the issue would need to go to mediation because Kmart appeared to be willing to\nremedy the problem.  \n-10-\n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 220    Filed 03/22/06   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS     Docume 3n0t 213     Filed 03/13/2006     Page 11 of 30(cid:10)\n36. Several weeks later, Ms. Evan contacted Ms. Lucas to report that Kmart claimed\nto have remedied the problem.  \n37. On or about November 18, 1998, Ms. Lucas went to the 200 W. Belleview Kmart\nto ascertain whether the problem had been remedied.  It had not:  while the proper number of\nspaces were designated for use by persons with disabilities, very few of them were of the\nrequired dimensions.  For example, most did not have any access aisles – necessary for people\nwho use wheelchairs or have other mobility impairments to get out of their cars – and none had a\nvan-accessible aisle.  In addition, some of the spaces did not have correct signage.  \n38. Ms. Lucas called Ms. Evan and stated that the parking situation at the 200 W.\nBelleview Kmart was still out of compliance with the ADA and ADAAG.  \n39. In approximately late November, 1998, Ms. Evan contacted Ms. Lucas and told\nher that Kmart did not want to mediate, so the Key Bridge Foundation would be sending the\ncomplaint back to the DOJ.\n40. On or about November 18, 1998, Ms. Lucas shopped at Kmart store number 7303\nat 363 S. Broadway in Denver, Colorado (“the 363 S. Broadway Kmart”).  When she arrived, the\nhandbaskets were stacked so high that she could not reach them, some of the aisles were blocked\nby merchandise, and no accessible check-out aisles were open.  When Ms. Lucas inquired why\nno such aisle was open, she was told by a Kmart employee that the cashier was on break.  There\nwere other – non-accessible – check-out aisles open at that time.  Finally, the automatic door was\nbroken and the other doors were too heavy for Ms. Lucas to open on her own.  \n-11-\n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 220    Filed 03/22/06   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS     Docume 3n0t 213     Filed 03/13/2006     Page 12 of 30(cid:10)\n41. On or about November 27, 1998, Ms. Lucas shopped at Kmart store number 4224\nat 2150 S. Monaco Parkway, Denver, Colorado (“the 2150 S. Monaco Kmart”).  On prior\noccasions when Ms. Lucas had shopped at this location, no accessible check-out aisles had been\nopen.  When she entered the store on this occasion, one such line was open.  However, by the\ntime she had completed her shopping and was ready to check out, there were no accessible\ncheck-out aisles open.  When she complained to the manager about this situation, she was told\nthat the cashier was on break.  There were other, non-accessible, check-out aisles open at that\ntime.  In addition, throughout the store merchandise was left in aisles, and in other places\ndisplayed in the aisles.  In the clothing sections the racks were too close together.  This impeded\nMs. Lucas’s access to merchandise and caused her to knock some clothing off of racks and onto\nthe floor.  \n42. In or about May, 1999, Ms. Lucas shopped at the 2150 S. Monaco Kmart. Again,\nwhen she entered the store an accessible check-out line was open.  And again, by the time she\nhad completed her shopping and was ready to check out, there were no accessible check-out\naisles open though there were other, non-accessible, check-out aisles open at that time.   Ms.\nLucas went to the customer service counter to request that an accessible check-out aisle be\nopened and Kmart did so. \n43. On or about August 20, 1999, Ms. Lucas shopped at Kmart store number 3627 at\n8500 W. Crestline Avenue in Littleton (“the 8500 W. Crestline Kmart”).  As she entered the\nstore, Ms. Lucas noted that there were two accessible check-out aisles, but that neither of them\nwas open.  She paused after she came through the door at which point a Kmart employee at the\n-12-\n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 220    Filed 03/22/06   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS     Docume 3n0t 213     Filed 03/13/2006     Page 13 of 30(cid:10)\ncustomer service counter by the name of Jennifer asked Ms. Lucas if she needed help.  As such,\nKmart was aware that Ms. Lucas – now using a power wheelchair – was shopping in the store.  \n44. Ms. Lucas was unable to access parts of the gardening, school supplies, furniture\nand household departments because numerous aisles were blocked by merchandise and other\nitems.  The electronics check-out counter was 41 inches high throughout.  The women’s fitting\nroom had no bench and had clothes hooks that were mounted at a height of approximately 60\ninches.  \n45. When Ms. Lucas went to check out, neither of the accessible check-out aisles was\nopen.  She got in the shortest inaccessible line but when she reached the front of the line, was\nunable to get through the aisle.  She informed the clerk that she was unable to get through the\naisle and that there were no accessible aisles open.  The clerk responded by leaving the aisle –\nand Ms. Lucas and the line of customers behind her.  Several minutes later the store opened\nanother aisle – though still not one of the accessible aisles.  Ms. Lucas continued to wait at the\nnow-abandoned aisle but when the clerk did not return and no accessible aisle opened, she\nproceeded to the customer service counter to complain.  The woman by the name of Jennifer –\nwho had initially asked Ms. Lucas whether she needed help – made clear that she knew Kmart\nwas required to keep an accessible check-out aisle open but informed Ms. Lucas that the clerk on\nthat aisle was on break.  \n46. Ms. Lucas asked to speak with a manager.  She explained the problem to floor\nmanager Craig Bass.  Mr. Bass shrugged and offered to help Ms. Lucas at the customer service\ncounter.  While this counter had a lowered portion, it was covered with boxes, notebooks and\n-13-\n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 220    Filed 03/22/06   USDC Colorado   Page 14 of\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS     Docume 3n0t 213     Filed 03/13/2006     Page 14 of 30(cid:10)\nmerchandise and, as such, was not usable by Ms. Lucas.  Mr. Bass refused to open an accessible\ncheck-out aisle. \n47. The 8500 W. Crestline Kmart has approximately 363 total parking spaces, only\nfour of which are accessible and none of which is wide enough to be van-accessible.  Two of the\nfour allegedly accessible spaces do not comply with the requirements of ADAAG.  Two\nadditional spaces on the north end of the building are marked as if to be accessible but were\nblocked by a roll-off trash container on the day Ms. Lucas shopped there.  There is, in any event,\nno curb cut to the sidewalk near those two spaces.  \n48. On or about August 20, 1999, Ms. Lucas shopped at the 200 W. Belleview Kmart. \nShe was unable to access merchandise in various areas throughout the store because of items\nblocking the aisles.  In addition, the single accessible fitting room was unusable because it was\nfilled with a shopping cart full of merchandise.  The electronics checkout counter was 41 inches\nhigh throughout.  \n49.  On or about August 20, 1999, Ms. Lucas shopped at Kmart store number 4187\nlocated at 2770 W. Evans Avenue in Denver, Colorado (“the 2770 W. Evans Kmart”).   She was\nunable to access merchandise in various areas throughout the store because of items blocking the\naisles.  In addition, the route to the accessible fitting room was blocked so that Ms. Lucas was\nunable to get to it.  The electronics checkout counter was 41 inches high throughout.  The\nwomen’s restroom did not have an accessible stall.  \n-14-\n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 220    Filed 03/22/06   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS     Docume 3n0t 213     Filed 03/13/2006     Page 15 of 30(cid:10)\n50. The 2770 W. Evans Kmart has approximately 423 total parking spaces only seven\nof which are accessible.  Many of the spaces are improperly marked, causing confusion and often\nleading to the situation in which cars are parked too close to one another for proper access.\n51.  On or about October 19, 1999, Ms. Lucas was in the Nashville, Tennessee area to\nattend to matters related to the adoption of her daughter.  At that time, she went to Kmart store\nnumber 3716 at 4646 Lebanon Pike in Hermitage, Tennessee.  She needed to get some pictures\ndeveloped and to purchase a few other items.  She had trouble finding an accessible space in\nwhich to park her rented van.  When she attempted to make her purchases, most of the aisles she\nattempted to enter were blocked by merchandise.  Because she was ultimately unable to access\nthe merchandise she had come to purchase, she left without buying anything.  \n52. On a number of occasions since October, 1999, Ms. Lucas has shopped at the 363\nS. Broadway Kmart.  On several of these occasions, she was accompanied by her daughter who\nalso uses a wheelchair.  Each time, Ms. Lucas and, at times, her daughter, have encountered\nbarriers, policies and treatment that deny them the full and equal enjoyment of the goods,\nservices, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of the store, including but not\nlimited to:  problems related to parking; aisles obstructed by merchandise; failure to open an\naccessible check-out aisle and/or failure to open a sufficient number of accessible check-out\naisles; failure of store employees to assist in removal of barriers; and rude treatment in response\nto requests for reasonable accommodation.  \n-15-\n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 220    Filed 03/22/06   USDC Colorado   Page 16 of\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS     Docume 3n0t 213     Filed 03/13/2006     Page 16 of 30(cid:10)\n53. Plaintiff Debbie L. Lane often shops at Kmart stores.  She has shopped at Kmart\nstores in Colorado and elsewhere.  Her experiences shopping at Kmart stores include but are not\nlimited to those described below.   \n54. On a number of occasions since October, 1999, Ms. Lane has shopped at Kmart\nstore number 4181, located at 3325 28th Street in Boulder, Colorado (the “28th Street Kmart”). \nOn many of the occasions she has shopped at the 28th Street Kmart, Ms. Lane has encountered\naisles that are blocked by merchandise.  Because of these barriers to access, she has been unable\nto get to the merchandise on her own and has had to enlist the assistance of a non-disabled friend\nto move items out of her way or to reach merchandise she was blocked from reaching.  In\naddition, on none of the occasions that she has shopped at the 28th Street Kmart has there been\nan accessible check-out aisle open.  On more than one occasion, Ms. Lane has asked store\npersonnel to open an accessible check-out aisle.  She has been instructed to use the customer\nservice counter instead.  Although she was able to pay for her merchandise at the customer\nservice counter, this transaction was rendered more difficult because the customer service\ncounter is too high.  \n55. Plaintiff Julie Reiskin often shops at Kmart stores in Colorado.  Her experiences\nshopping at Kmart stores include but are not limited to those described below.   \n56. On at least ten occasions over the past seven years, Ms. Reiskin has shopped at the \n363 S. Broadway Kmart.  On many of those occasions, Ms. Reiskin has encountered barriers,\npolicies and treatment that deny her the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities,\nprivileges, advantages, and accommodations of the store, including but not limited to:  aisles\n-16-\n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 220    Filed 03/22/06   USDC Colorado   Page 17 of\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS     Docume 3n0t 213     Filed 03/13/2006     Page 17 of 30(cid:10)\nobstructed by merchandise; display racks situated too close together; failure to open an accessible\ncheck-out aisle and/or failure to open a sufficient number of accessible check-out aisles; and\ndesignation of the only accessible check-out aisle as limited to patrons buying a limited number\nof items.  \n57. Plaintiff Edward Muegge shops at Kmart stores in Hawai’i.  He has shopped at\nKmart stores in Hawai’i within the past year.  While shopping at Kmart, Mr. Muegge has\nencountered barriers, policies and treatment that denied him the full and equal enjoyment of the\ngoods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of the store.  \n58. Although he lives in Hawai’i, Plaintiff Edward Muegge visits California and\nshops at Kmart stores in California.  He has shopped at Kmart stores in California within the past\nyear.

Plaintiffs intend to continue to shop at Kmart stores in the near future.  \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF\n(On behalf of Plaintiff Carrie Ann Lucas and other Damages Settlement Sub-Class members for\nviolation of the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act)\n70. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in this \nSecond Amended Class Action Complaint as if fully set forth herein.\n71. The Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act (“CADA”) states, “It is a discriminatory\npractice and unlawful for a person, directly or indirectly, to refuse, withhold from, or deny to an\nindividual or a group, because of disability, race, creed, color, sex, marital status, national origin,\nor ancestry, the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages,\nor accommodations of a place of public accommodation . . .”  Colo. Rev. Stat. § 24-34-601(2).\n72. The CADA defines a “place of public accommodation” to include “any place of\nbusiness engaged in any sales to the public and any place offering services, facilities, privileges,\n-19-\n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 220    Filed 03/22/06   USDC Colorado   Page 20 of\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS     Docume 3n0t 213     Filed 03/13/2006     Page 20 of 30(cid:10)\nadvantages, or accommodations to the public, including but not limited to any business offering\nwholesale or retail sales to the public . . .”  Id. § 24-34-601(1).\n73. Kmart stores are places of public accommodation as defined in the CADA.  \n74. Plaintiff Carrie Ann Lucas and Damages Settlement Sub-Class Members who\nshopped at Kmart stores in Colorado or would have shopped at such stores but for allegedly\ndiscriminatory barriers seek minimum statutory damages under § 24-34-602.\n75.

The bankruptcy of Defendant Kmart Corporation (“Kmart”) does not affect\nPlaintiffs’ ability to pursue injunctive relief under Title III of the Americans with\nDisabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12181 - 12189 (“ADA” or “Title III”), on a class-\nwide basis; and\n! Should Plaintiffs succeed in obtaining injunctive relief under Title III, Plaintiffs\nwill be entitled to recover their reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs for time spent\nboth before and after Kmart’s bankruptcy. \n\nBackground\nPlaintiffs brought this case to challenge violations of the ADA at Kmart’s stores\nnationwide.  Plaintiffs allege that Kmart has company-wide policies, practices and physical\nconditions that present barriers to -- and therefore discriminate against -- its customers who use\nwheelchairs.  \nOn June 7, 2001, Plaintiffs moved to certify this case as a nationwide class action\npursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Briefing of that motion was\ncompleted on January 4, 2002.  On January 22, 2002, Defendant Kmart filed a voluntary Petition\nfor Relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §§ 101 et seq., in the Bankruptcy\nCourt for the Northern District of Illinois.  Pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 362, that filing automatically\nstayed the present litigation.  On August 29, 2002, this Court administratively closed this case. \nOn April 23, 2003, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed Kmart’s Plan of Reorganization,\nwhich terminated the automatic stay.  On May 9, 2003, Plaintiffs moved to reopen this case and\nrequested a status conference.  On May 13, 2003, this Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion,\nscheduled a status conference for June 23, and invited the parties to submit -- on or before June\n20 -- status reports and statements indicating their position on how this case should proceed.  \nOn June 9, 2003, Defendant Kmart filed with this Court a letter from Divisional Vice\nPresident Janet H. Delecke (the “Delecke Letter”), which asserted that this case involved claims\nthat were discharged upon confirmation of Kmart’s plan of reorganization and should therefore\nbe closed.  Pursuant to this Court’s Minute Order of June 9, 2003, Plaintiffs filed their response\nto the Delecke Letter on June 16, 2003.  Both parties filed status reports on June 20, 2003;\n-2-\n\nDefendant’s status report also contained its reply to Plaintiffs’ June 16 response to the Delecke\nLetter.  \nDuring the Status Conference on June 23, 2003, this Court denied Kmart’s request to\nclose this case and stated that it “would allow plaintiffs to proceed under the ADA claim for\ninjunctive relief.”  (Reporter’s Transcript: Status Conference (“Tr.”) at 8.)  The Court further\nrequested Plaintiffs to submit a brief “address[ing] the implications, if any, of Kmart’s post-\nbankruptcy status on the class certification issue.”  (Id. at 9.)  In addition, the Court noted that\nPlaintiffs had not had the chance to respond to the arguments raised in Defendant’s Status\nConference Report, filed June 20, 2003, and specifically invited Plaintiffs to address Defendant’s\nargument relating to attorneys’ fees.  (Id. at 5, 10.)  \nThis brief addresses the matters raised by the Court at the June 23 hearing.  \nI.  Kmart’s Bankruptcy Does Not Impair the Appropriateness or Effectiveness of \nClass Certification in this Case. \nAs this Court held in the hearing on June 23, Plaintiffs’ Title III action was not\ndischarged by confirmation of Defendant’s plan of reorganization, and Plaintiffs are “allow[ed] \n. . . to proceed under the ADA claim for injunctive relief.”  (Tr. at 8.)1  The fact that Defendant\n1   Kmart argued in its Status Conference Report that “[a]ny dispute concerning\nwhether plaintiffs’ pending action is a pre-petition claim and was discharged through bankruptcy\nshould be decided by the Bankruptcy Court.”  (Status Conference Report at 6).  This is not\naccurate.  Except for actions concerning dischargeability under certain subsections of § 523 of\nthe Bankruptcy Code -- none of which are at issue here -- this Court has concurrent jurisdiction\nwith the bankruptcy court to determine dischargeability.  Whitehouse v. LaRoche, 277 F.3d 568,\n578 (1st Cir. 2002) (holding that,“[w]here an asserted exception to discharge relies upon none of\nthe four waivable exceptions to discharge [§ 523(a)(2), (4), (6), and (15)], . . . the jurisdiction of\nthe bankruptcy court is concurrent, hence nonexclusive”), see also Rein v. Providian Fin. Corp.,\n(continued...)\n-3-\n\nhas been through and emerged from bankruptcy should have no effect on Plaintiffs’ request to\npursue those ADA claims for injunctive relief using the procedural device of a class action.  \nA class action is an efficient and economical procedural2 tool to litigate the claims of\nindividuals harmed by common policies and practices, such as those at issue in the present case. \n“[T]he class-action device saves the resources of both the courts and the parties by permitting an\nissue potentially affecting every [class member] to be litigated in an economical fashion.” \nCalifano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 701 (1979).  The Supreme Court has compared those who\nseek to vindicate the rights of a class to “private attorney[s] general,” United States Parole\nComm’n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 403 (1980), and a leading commentator has noted that class\nactions “enhance the effectiveness of private attorney general litigation that otherwise might be\nbrought only on an individual basis.”  1 Herbert Newberg & Alba Conte, Newberg on Class\nActions § 1.06 at 1-19 (3d ed. 1992).  \nThe purpose of the Bankruptcy Code “is to provide a ‘fresh start’ to a discharged debtor. \nA suit for illegal conduct occurring after discharge threatens neither the letter nor the spirit of the\nbankruptcy laws.”  O’Loghlin v. County of Orange, 229 F.3d 871, 875 (9th Cir. 2000)\n(quotations and citations omitted).  Plaintiffs’ use of the class action procedural device to\n1(...continued)\n270 F.3d 895, 904 & n.15 (9th Cir. 2001) (same).  \n2 A ruling on class certification is a procedural ruling, collateral to the merits of the\nlitigation.  Cf. Deposit Guar. Nat’l Bank v. Roper, 445 U.S. 326, 336 (1980) (holding that denial\nof class certification is a procedural ruling, collateral to the merits of the litigation).  It is not, and\nis not permitted to be, a ruling on the merits.  See Cook v. Rockwell Int’l Corp., 151 F.R.D. 378,\n381 (D. Colo. 1993) (citing Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 177-78 (1970)).  \n-4-\n\nchallenge ongoing, post-discharge, illegal conduct in an efficient and economical way, likewise,\nwould threaten neither the letter nor the spirit of the bankruptcy laws.  \nSimilarly, nothing that occurred during Kmart’s reorganization would undermine the\nappropriateness of class certification in this case.  Rule 23 looks essentially to whether it makes\nsense to resolve Plaintiffs’ claims on a class-wide basis:  whether class members are numerous;\nwhether they have common legal and factual claims; whether the class representatives’ claims\nare typical; and whether those individuals can adequately represent the class.  Fed. R. Civ. P.\n23(a).  Kmart continues to be operated on a centralized basis -- as it was pre-bankruptcy --\nmaking a class action the best way to address the impact of its company-wide policies on its\ncustomers who use wheelchairs and scooters.  To the extent specific policies may have changed -\n- of which there is currently no evidence3 -- the question whether such changes bring Kmart into\ncompliance with the ADA is a question on the merits, one which is common to the class and best\nresolved on a class-wide basis. \nThe only specific post-bankruptcy change to which Defendant points is the fact that it\nnow has 1,500 stores, instead of the 2,100 it had before it declared bankruptcy.  (Status\nConference Report at 8.)  This would give it approximately 70% of the number of stores that\nexisted pre-bankruptcy.  Even if the class is only 70% the size it once was, it would still have 1.2\n3 See, e.g., Tr. at 7 (in which this Court noted that “Kmart does not allege it has\nchanged any of its allegedly discriminatory policies.”)  \n-5-\n\nmillion -- instead of 1.7 million4 -- members, sufficiently large that joinder is clearly\nimpracticable.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1). \nDefendant also asserts generally that its financial situation has changed due to the\nbankruptcy, making any analysis of what is “readily achievable” pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\n§ 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv) “extremely complicated.”  (Def.’s Status Conference Report at 9.) \nAlthough Plaintiffs believe that no “readily achievable” analysis will be necessary in this case,5 \nthe question of what is readily achievable goes to the merits of the case.  And because that\nquestion requires an analysis of company-wide resources, 28 C.F.R. § 36.104, it is a question\nthat is common to the class.  See Arnold v. United Artists Theatre Circuit, Inc., 158 F.R.D. 439,\n449 (N.D. Cal. 1994) (holding that where plaintiffs challenged -- under Title III -- conditions at\nmultiple sites owned by a single corporate defendant, the legal standard depended on “various\ncorporation-wide factors such as the availability of resources.  These are additional issues of fact\nand law common among the subclasses.”), quoted in Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition v.\nTaco Bell Corp., 184 F.R.D. 354, 360 (D. Colo. 1999). \n4  See Pls.’ Substituted Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Class Certification (filed July 13,\n2001) at 31. \n5 “Readily achievable” is the standard that applies to existing facilities, that is,\nthose were built before January 26, 1993 and have not been altered since.  In such facilities,\nbarriers to access must be removed only where it is “readily achievable” to do so.  42 U.S.C.\n§ 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv).  All but 24 Kmart stores were built after January 26, 1993 or fully altered\nsince that time.  As such, these facilities are all required to comply with the Department of\nJustice Standards for Accessible Design.  28 C.F.R. § 36.406(a).  See also Pls.’ Reply Mem. in\nSupp. of Mot. for Class Certification (filed Dec. 3, 2001) at 40.  \n-6-\n\nIn sum, Plaintiffs’ use of the class action procedural device to pursue injunctive relief to\nremedy ongoing violations of the ADA is in no way inconsistent with the goals of the\nBankruptcy Code.  Likewise, nothing that occurred during Kmart’s bankruptcy affects Plaintiffs’\nability to pursue such injunctive relief on a class-wide basis.  Any substantive changes in\nKmart’s operations following bankruptcy present common questions of law and fact -- on the\nmerits -- that are appropriate for resolution through a class action.  A class action continues to be\nthe best way to address systemically Kmart’s company-wide policies and practices that\ndiscriminate against its customers who use wheelchairs.  \nII. Should Plaintiffs Be Entitled to Recover Attorneys’ Fees as Prevailing Parties in this\nLitigation, Such Recovery Would Not Be Not Limited to Fees Relating to Post-\nDischarge Legal Work. \nDefendant argued in its Status Conference Report that “Plaintiffs’ pre-petition attorneys’\nfees qualify as a ‘claim’” because they “were incurred pre-petition and relate to pre-petition\nconduct.” (Id. at 5.)  As a result, Kmart argued, Plaintiffs’ right to such fees has been discharged.\n(Id. at 6.)   This represents a misunderstanding of the fee-shifting provision of the Americans\nwith Disabilities Act. \nA. Any Attorneys’ Fees Awarded to Plaintiffs Would Be Based on Kmart’s\nPost-Petition Conduct and Would Be Ancillary to Nondischargeable\nInjunctive Relief. \nSection 505 of the Americans with Disabilities Act states that, “[i]n any action or\nadministrative proceeding commenced pursuant to this chapter, the court or agency, in its\ndiscretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney’s\nfee, including litigation expenses, and costs.”  42 U.S.C. § 12205.  The United States Supreme\n-7-\n\nCourt has made clear that a party is not a prevailing party, entitled to fees, unless and until it\nachieves a “material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties,” that is, through an\nenforceable judgment on the merits or a court-ordered consent decree.  Buckhannon Bd. & Care\nHome, Inc. v. W. Va. Dep’t of Health & Human Resources, 532 U.S. 598, 604 (2001) (quotation\nand citation omitted).  No such judgment or decree entered prior to Kmart’s bankruptcy.  More\nimportantly, any judgment or decree in this case will be based on Kmart’s on-going, post-\ndischarge violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act.  42 U.S.C. § 12188(a)(1) (remedies\nare available to “any person who is being subjected to discrimination on the basis of disability”)\n(emphasis added).  That is, although evidence of Kmart’s pre-petition violations will be\nadmissible to show its discriminatory practice, see O’Loghlin, 229 F.3d at 876, any injunction\nmust ultimately be based on the conclusion that these practices are ongoing post-discharge.  As\nsuch, any entitlement to fees will be based on Kmart’s post-discharge -- rather than pre-petition -\n- conduct.\n-8-\n\nBecause the situation before the Court is rather rare,6 Plaintiffs have been able to identify\nonly one case precisely on point; in that case, although not discussed explicitly, the fee award\nultimately included both pre- and post-bankruptcy work.  The defendant in AM International,\nInc. v. Datacard Corporation brought counterclaims requesting, among other things, injunctive\nrelief under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), 42 U.S.C. § 6901 et seq. \n106 F.3d 1342, 1346 (7th. Cir. 1997).  After defendant Datacard filed its counterclaims, the\nplaintiff filed for bankruptcy.  Id. at 1346.  The district court ultimately held that Datacard’s\ncounterclaims for injunctive relief had not been discharged, and that it was entitled to attorneys’\nfees on its RCRA and other claims.  Id.  On appeal, the Seventh Circuit upheld the district\ncourt’s determination that Datacard’s request for injunctive relief under RCRA was\nnondischargeable.  Id. at 1348.  Furthermore, the Seventh Circuit acknowledged that an award of\nfees was appropriate and remanded to the district court for a more complete explanation for the\nbasis for its fee award.  Id. at 1352.  It did not address -- and thus did not preclude -- an award of\nfees for pre-petition work.  \n6 Most of the cases involving nondischargeability of actions for injunctive relief are\nenvironmental cases brought by government regulatory agencies, see, e.g., In re Torwico Elecs.,\nInc., 8 F.3d 146, 150-51 (3d Cir. 1993), cert. denied 511 U.S. 1046 (1994), In re CMC Heartland\nPartners, 966 F.2d 1143, 1146 (7th Cir. 1992), In re Chateaugay Corp., 944 F.2d 997, 1008 (2d\nCir. 1991), or common law claims, In re Ben Franklin Hotel Assocs., 186 F.3d 301, 305 (3d Cir.\n1999), In re Davis, 3 F.3d 113, 116-17 (5th Cir. 1993), In re King’s Gate Apartments, Ltd., 206\nB.R. 233, 234-35 (Bankr. W.D. Okla. 1996).  These types of claims do not typically include fee-\nshifting provisions, so the question of dischargeability of attorneys’ fees did not arise.  The non-\ncompete provision at issue in In re Udell did require payment of attorneys fees.  18 F.3d 403, 405\n(7th Cir. 1994).  The Seventh Circuit held that the action to enforce the non-compete was not\ndischarged but did not address attorneys’ fees.  Id. at 409-10.  According to counsel for one of\nthe parties, the question of attorneys’ fees was settled between the parties following the Seventh\nCircuit’s decision. (Robertson Decl. ¶ 4.)\n-9-\n\nOn remand, counsel for Datacard petitioned for fees incurred between 1986 and 1994,\nthat is, for a substantial amount of time prior to the 1993 bankruptcy filing.  See AM Int’l, Inc. v.\nDatacard Corp., Civil Action No. 87 C 3408 (N.D. Ill.), Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Am. J. and\nRequest for Litigation Costs at 2, 13 (Robertson Decl. Ex. 2.)  Although the district court did not\nanalyze the question of dischargeability of the pre-bankruptcy fees, it did award an amount that\nincluded all requested fees for time spent prior to the 1993 bankruptcy filing.  See id. Order\ndated Nov. 25, 1997 (Robertson Decl. Ex. 3).7 \nThe decision to award attorneys’ fees for pre-bankruptcy time in connection with a\nnondischargeable claim for injunctive relief is consistent with Supreme Court precedent holding\nthat attorneys’ fees are ancillary to injunctive relief, and may be awarded even where an award\nof monetary damages is prohibited.  Confirmation of a plan of bankruptcy discharges any “right\nto payment” and “right to . . . an equitable remedy [that] gives rise to a right to payment.”  11\nU.S.C. §§ 101(5) & (12), 1141(d)(1)(A).  Confirmation does not, however, discharge actions for\nprospective injunctive relief.  See, e.g., In re CMC Heartland Partners, 966 F.2d at 1146.8  The\nEleventh Amendment -- for different reasons but with similar effect -- bars actions “‘for the\n7 The district court deducted fees incurred for work relating to the 1993 bankruptcy\nproceeding itself on the grounds that they were unrelated to Datacard’s environmental claims, an\nargument Datacard did not contest.  (Robertson Decl. Ex. 3, at 3.)  For the reasons discussed\nbelow at pages 12-16, Plaintiffs’ fees incurred in connection with Kmart’s bankruptcy will be\nrecoverable to the extent they were “‘useful and of a type ordinarily necessary to advance the ...\nlitigation’ to the point where the party succeeded.”  Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens’\nCouncil for Clean Air, 478 U.S. 546, 561 (1986)(quotation omitted). \n8 See also Pls.’ Resp. to Def.’s June 6, 2003 Letter (filed June 16, 2003) at 3-7\n(citing cases).  \n-10-\n\nrecovery of money from the state,’”  Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 663 (1974) (quoting Ford\nMotor Co. v. Dep’t of Treasury, 323 U.S. 459, 464 (1945)), but does not bar actions for\nprospective injunctive relief against state officials.  Bd. of Trustees of the Univ. of Ala. v.\nGarrett, 531 U.S. 356, 374 n.9 (2001) (citing Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908)).  \nIn the latter type of case, when plaintiffs sue state actors in their official capacity and\nobtain prospective injunctive relief, they are also entitled to recover attorneys’ fees ancillary to\nsuch relief, despite the prohibition on collecting money damages.  Missouri v. Jenkins ex rel.\nAgyei, 491 U.S. 274 (1989).  As the Jenkins Court explained, with reference to its earlier ruling\nin Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678 (1979): \nThe State contended that any such award was subject to the Eleventh\nAmendment’s constraints on actions for damages payable from a State’s treasury.  \nWe relied, in rejecting that contention, on the distinction drawn in our earlier\ncases between “retroactive monetary relief” and “prospective injunctive relief.” \nAttorney’s fees, we held, belonged to the latter category, because they constituted\nreimbursement of “expenses incurred in litigation seeking only prospective\nrelief,” rather than “retroactive liability for prelitigation conduct.”  We explained: \n“Unlike ordinary ‘retroactive’ relief such as damages or restitution, an award of\ncosts does not compensate the plaintiff for the injury that first brought him into\ncourt.  Instead, the award reimburses him for a portion of the expenses he\nincurred in seeking prospective relief.”  \nId. at 278 (internal citations and quotations omitted).  The Court concluded that “an award of\nattorney’s fees ancillary to prospective relief is not subject to the strictures of the Eleventh\nAmendment.”  Id. at 279.  Analogously to the holdings of Hutto and Jenkins, then, awards of\nattorneys’ fees ancillary to nondischargeable claims for injunctive relief are not retroactive\nmonetary claims and, as such, should be unaffected by the Bankruptcy Code.  \n-11-\n\nIn sum, any entitlement to attorneys’ fees under the Americans with Disabilities Act\nwould be based on entry of judgment ordering injunctive relief in favor of Plaintiffs which\nwould, in turn, be based on post-petition conduct, and any such award would be ancillary to the\ninjunctive relief.  As such, no part of Plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees were discharged by confirmation\nof Defendant’s plan of reorganization.  \n-12-\n\nB. Even If Plaintiffs’ Fees for Work Done in Connection with Defendant’s Pre-\npetition Conduct Have Been Discharged, These Fees Are Still Recoverable\nBecause the Work was Necessary to Address Defendant’s Post-Petition\nViolations of the ADA.\nEven if, contrary to the authority above, this Court should consider fees attributable to\npre-petition time to have been discharged in bankruptcy, they may nonetheless be recoverable\nbecause they were necessary to address Defendant’s post-petition violations of the ADA. \nPrevailing parties in fee-shifting litigation are not only entitled to recover attorneys’ fees\nfor work done on the case in which they prevailed, but may also be entitled to recover for work\ndone in a related but separate case, even where there is no legal entitlement to fees in the\nseparate case.  The prevailing party is entitled to recover fees from the separate proceeding if\nthose fees were incurred for work that was “‘useful and of a type ordinarily necessary to advance\nthe . . . litigation’ to the point where the party succeeded.”  Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley\nCitizens’ Council for Clean Air, 478 U.S. 546, 561 (1986) (quoting Webb v. Bd. of Educ., 471\nU.S. 234, 243 (1985)).  \nRecently, the Ninth Circuit awarded fees -- under the ADA fee-shifting provision that\nwill govern Plaintiffs’ fee petition in the present case -- for work performed in a completely\nseparate federal court case involving a different defendant but identical issues, despite the fact\nthat the plaintiffs’ attorneys ultimately lost the separate case, barring recovery of fees under\nsection 505.  42 U.S.C. § 12205.  The plaintiffs in Armstrong v. Davis brought suit under the\nADA challenging disability discrimination in the California state prison system.  318 F.3d 965,\n968 (9th Cir. 2003).  The plaintiffs prevailed in Armstrong, making them eligible for fees under\n-13-\n\nsection 505 of the ADA, as well as under the analogous provision of the Rehabilitation Act of\n1973.  29 U.S.C. § 794a(b).  During the course of the Armstrong litigation, the Supreme Court\ngranted certiorari in Yeskey v. Penn. Dep’t of Corr., 118 F.3d 168 (3d Cir. 1997), on the\nquestion whether the ADA applied to prisons, a question central to the Armstrong litigation. \nCounsel for the plaintiffs in Armstrong took over the representation of the Yeskey plaintiffs\nbefore the Supreme Court, and were successful in establishing that the ADA does indeed apply\nto state prisons.  Penn. Dep’t of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 213 (1998), see Armstrong, 318\nF.3d at 968-69.  The Armstrong plaintiffs’ counsel continued to represent the Yeskey plaintiffs\non remand, ultimately losing the case on summary judgment.  Yeskey v. Pennsylvania, 76 F.\nSupp. 2d 575 (M.D. Pa. 1999).  As such, those attorneys were not entitled to recover fees in the\nYeskey litigation.  Armstrong, 318 F.3d at 972.  Nevertheless, the Armstrong court held that\n“[b]ecause the work in Yeskey was important to the preservation of the Armstrong Plaintiffs’\nrights, and because their counsel performed the work in order to protect their interests, they\nwould be entitled as the prevailing party in the Armstrong litigation to an award of attorney’s\nfees for that work from the Armstrong Defendants.”  Armstrong, 318 F.3d at 972.  \nSimilarly, in Gulfstream III Associates v. Gulfstream Aerospace Corp., 995 F.2d 414 (3d\nCir. 1993), the court held that the prevailing plaintiffs could be compensated for work devoted to\na separate but consolidated case -- Rosefielde v. Falcon Jet Corp., 701 F. Supp. 1053 (D.N.J.\n1988) -- against a different defendant that raised the same legal issue.  The plaintiff had settled\nwith the Falcon Jet defendant but had not recovered fees.  After the plaintiff prevailed against\nGulfstream Aerospace, it sought its fees for both the Falcon Jet and the Gulfstream Aerospace\n-14-\n\nlitigation.  The district court disallowed Falcon Jet fees, on the grounds that there was no\n“judicial precedent allowing attorneys fees to be recovered for services rendered in a previous\naction to which the defendant was not a party.”  Gulfstream III Assocs., Inc. v. Gulfstream\nAerospace Corp., 789 F. Supp. 1288, 1294 (D.N.J. 1992), quoted in Gulfstream III, 995 F.3d at\n419.  \nThe Third Circuit reversed, holding that fees and expenses from separate litigation are\ncompensable \nif the plaintiff can prove that the fees and expenses incurred in the other litigation\nresulted in work product that was actually utilized in the instant litigation, that the\ntime spent on other litigation was “inextricably linked” to the issues raised in the\npresent litigation, and that plaintiff has not previously been compensated for those\nfees and expenses.  \nGulfstream III, 995 F.3d at 420.  Plaintiffs’ counsel’s pre-bankruptcy time in the present case\nwill easily meet this test.  Taking the last two factors first, the pre- and post-bankruptcy issues\nare most certainly “inextricably linked” as they concern the same legal issues at the same\ncompany in a subset of the same stores, and Plaintiffs’ counsel will not previously have been\ncompensated for that time.  As for the first factor, the Third Circuit specifically noted that the\nGulfstream III trial court had relied on the Falcon Jet record, and that if it had not done so, the\nplaintiff “would have had to duplicate at least some of that work, and the time spent and\nexpenses incurred would have been appropriate for inclusion in this case.  We see no reasonable\nbasis for encouraging duplicative work.”  Id.  \nThe analysis set forth in Armstrong and Gulf Stream III demonstrates that Plaintiffs will\nbe entitled to recover attorneys’ fees for pre-petition work if they prevail in this case because\n-15-\n\nsuch work will be “useful and of a type ordinarily necessary” to this litigation.  This is true even\nif this Court determines that Plaintiffs’ pre-bankruptcy attorneys’ fees were discharged.  The\nadverse summary judgment decision in Yeskey meant that the plaintiffs in that case were not\nprevailing parties and had, therefore, no legal entitlement to recover attorneys’ fees.  See 42\nU.S.C. § 12205, Buckhannon, 532 U.S. at 604.  Nevertheless, because time devoted to Yeskey\nwas necessary to the success of Armstrong, the time was compensable in Armstrong.  Should\nthis Court determine in this case that, due to discharge, there is no legal entitlement to fees for\npre-petition time, that time should nonetheless be recoverable if it was spent on matters\nnecessary to the success of the surviving, post-petition, action for injunctive relief.  The\nvoluminous factual record9 that Plaintiffs’ counsel developed pre-bankruptcy will be almost\ncertainly of use to this Court in evaluating Kmart’s ongoing, post-bankruptcy conduct,10 and\nPlaintiffs’ counsel’s extensive legal research on ADA and class certification issues (partially\nreflected in their more than 100 pages of briefing on the motion for class certification) will be\nfully applicable to the litigation of Kmart’s post-bankruptcy conduct.  To deny fees for that\n9 The parties have taken approximately 70 depositions and exchanged -- on paper\nand electronically -- over 140,000 pages of documents.  In support of their motion for class\ncertification, Plaintiffs submitted their own extensive deposition testimony and that of 45 other\nKmart shoppers with disabilities describing discrimination they had encountered at Kmart stores\naround the country.  They also provided testimony from Defendants’ own employees detailing\ncompany-wide policies that had discriminatory effects, and from Defendants’ own experts,\ndocumenting those discriminatory effects.  Finally, Plaintiffs submitted a 2,773-page print-out\ndocumenting 19,406 records in which Kmart’s mystery shoppers noted discriminatory conditions\nat Kmart stores.  \n10 See, e.g., O’Loghlin, 229 F.3d at 876 (holding that pre-bankruptcy evidence is\nadmissible to show a course of conduct).  \n-16-\n\nimportant factual and legal research, should Plaintiffs ultimately prevail on their ADA cause of\naction, would encourage the type of duplication the Third Circuit in Gulf Stream III sought to\navoid.  For these reasons, Plaintiffs are entitled to their fees for pre-petition work regardless of\nthe impact of Defendant’s bankruptcy on such fees.\nConclusion\nFor the reasons discussed above, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court:\n1.   Determine that Kmart’s bankruptcy had no impact on Plaintiffs’ motion for class\ncertification and proceed to address that motion, either through oral argument or on the briefs;\nand\n2.   Determine that, should Plaintiffs prevail on their request for injunctive relief\nunder Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, they will be entitled to “a reasonable\nattorney’s fee, including litigation expenses, and costs” pursuant to section 505 of that statute, 42\nU.S.C. § 12205, regardless of when those fees were incurred. \nRespectfully submitted,\nFOX & ROBERTSON, P.C.\n                                                \nAmy F.

Class Counsel seek compensation for their\nwork in securing a settlement on behalf of a Nationwide Class seeking relief under Title III of the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12181 et seq., and a Damages Sub Class\nseeking relief under the laws of seven states.  Defendant Kmart Corporation (“Kmart”) has agreed\nto pay the amount sought by Class Counsel, subject to Court approval.  In addition, after an\nextensive, Court approved program to notify the class of the terms of the settlement, including the\namount of fees and costs sought by Class Counsel, there have been no objections to the requested\n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 234    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 20\naward.  For the reasons set forth below, this Court grants the Petition, and approves the fees and\ncosts sought by Class Counsel.\nBACKGROUND\nI. The Litigation.\nIn 1999, Fox & Robertson entered into a contingency fee agreement to bring suit against\nKmart based on alleged violations of Title III of the ADA.  Although initially brought only on\nbehalf of one plaintiff, the complaint was amended in 2000 to assert a nationwide class action.\nThe evidence submitted by Class Counsel demonstrates that they performed a significant\namount of work in connection with Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification.  This included, for\nexample: reviewing over 100,000 pages of documents, as well as a database with data from over\n65,000 “mystery shopper” reports; taking or defending over 50 depositions of fact and expert\nwitnesses; interviewing, and obtaining declarations from, approximately 80 putative class\nmembers; and writing, or responding to, more than 15 briefs on the class certification issue.\nPlaintiffs filed their final class certification brief on January 4, 2002; two weeks later,\nKmart filed a voluntary Petition for Relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C.\n§§ 101 et seq., in the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois.  Plaintiffs moved to\nlift the bankruptcy stay, which was denied by the bankruptcy court.  Plaintiffs unsuccessfully\nappealed the denial.\nAfter Kmart emerged from bankruptcy on May 6, 2003, it argued that the class claims for\ninjunctive relief had been discharged by its bankruptcy.  This Court held that the injunctive claims\nhad not been discharged, and that the case could proceed.\n 2 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 234    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 20\nBetween the summer of 2003 and the summer of 2005, the parties continued to litigate the\ncase, submitting opposing briefs on discovery matters and recent relevant decisions in other cases.\nOn July 13, 2005, this Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification and certified a\nnationwide class of individuals who use wheelchairs or scooters and who shop at Kmart stores.\nKmart immediately sought and obtained permission from the Tenth Circuit to appeal that decision\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. (“Rule”) 23(f).  Briefing of the appeal has been continued pending\nsettlement negotiations.\nDuring the course of this litigation, Kmart has been represented by two large, Denver area\nlaw firms and three other large law firms based in other cities around the country; a sixth large,\nnational firm represented Kmart during its bankruptcy.\nII. The Settlement.\nIn August 2005, the parties initiated settlement negotiations that resulted in the settlement\nagreement before this Court.  The parties carefully structured the settlement negotiations.  The\nparties reached agreement concerning a large part of the injunctive relief before turning to\ndamages, and the negotiations concerning damages and injunctive relief were kept completely\nseparate from one another.  Further, the parties did not discuss attorneys’ fees until there was\nsubstantial agreement on all parts of the injunctive and damages settlement.\nThe settlement agreement provides injunctive relief that is comprehensive and far \nreaching, resulting in immediate improvements in Kmart’s policies relating to accessibility, as well\nas surveys of each of Kmart’s stores to identify, and remedy, architectural barriers.  See Lucas v.\nKmart Corp., 234 F.R.D. 688, 691 92 (D. Colo. 2006).  In addition, the settlement creates a $13\n 3 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 234    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 20\nmillion fund on behalf of a Damages Sub Class, which Class Counsel believes is the largest\nmonetary settlement ever of a public accommodations disability discrimination case.\nThe Damages Sub Class fund provides compensation for the release of claims for\nstatutory minimum damages under the laws of the seven Statutory Minimum Damages States.\nLucas, 234 F.R.D. at 692.  The formula approved by this Court to allocate the damages fund\namong these states took into account two factors: the number of Kmart stores in the state, and\nthe minimum amount of statutory damages recoverable in the state.  Id. at 695.  Based on this\nformula, California receives over $12 million of the fund, in large part because California state law\nprovides by far the largest amount of minimum statutory damages of any state.\nIn the settlement agreement, Kmart also agreed to pay, subject to Court approval, $3.25\nmillion in attorneys’ fees for work done prior to the final approval date, and costs incurred\nthrough that date in an amount not to exceed $125,000.  In addition, Kmart agreed to pay Class\nCounsel’s reasonable fees and costs relating to implementing and monitoring the Agreement after\nfinal approval.\nIII. Class Counsel.\nThe majority of work on behalf of the class in this case was performed by the firm of Fox\n& Robertson.  Class Counsel has submitted the following evidence concerning the firm.\nFox & Robertson is a small firm, consisting (for most of the litigation) of two attorneys,\nTim Fox and Amy Robertson, and (for the period 2000 to 2002) of attorney Michael Breeskin as\nwell.\n 4 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 234    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 20\nFox & Robertson has a strong emphasis in representing plaintiffs in disability rights cases,\nand has represented plaintiffs, or appeared in cases, in California, Colorado, Florida,\nMassachusetts and Virginia.\nMr. Fox graduated from Stanford Law School in 1991, and Ms. Robertson graduated\nfrom Yale Law School in 1988.  Together they formed Fox & Robertson in 1996, and since then\nhave litigated dozens of disability rights cases, including several large class actions    according to\nMs. Robertson, courts have appointed Fox & Robertson as class counsel in six disability rights\nclass actions.  Mr. Fox and Ms. Robertson have written and spoken extensively on issues relating\nto the rights of persons with disabilities.\nMr. Breeskin graduated from Georgetown University Law Center in 1975.  He has had\nextensive experience in the field of disability rights, including working for disability rights\norganizations for nine years before joining Fox & Robertson.  He, too, has written and spoken\nextensively on disability rights issues.\nThe evidence demonstrates that this litigation placed a heavy burden on Fox & Robertson.\nThe vast majority of costs were fronted by Fox & Robertson.  At several points during the\nlitigation, Fox & Robertson was unable to take on new cases because of its commitment to the\nKmart case.  For example, in 2001, almost 50% of the total hours billed at Fox & Robertson were\nfor work on this case.\nFox & Robertson’s co counsel practice in communities across the country.  Many of these\nattorneys are known nationally for their skill in disability, civil rights and/or class action cases.\n 5 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 234    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 20\nARGUMENT\nKmart has agreed to pay $13 million in damages, $3.25 million in fees, and $125,000 in\ncosts, resulting in an overall monetary recovery of $16,375,000.  Class Counsel seek an award of\nfees in the amount of $3.25 million, which represents less than 20% of the total monetary\nrecovery,1 and a multiplier of 1.87 on Class Counsel’s combined lodestar.  For the reasons set\nforth below, this Court grants Class Counsel’s Petition under the Tenth Circuit’s common fund\napproach.  In the alternative, the Court grants the Petition under California’s enhanced lodestar\napproach.\nI. Recovery Of Fees Under Tenth Circuit Law.\nA. Legal Background.\nClass Counsel seek recovery of their fees and costs under the common fund doctrine as\napplied in this Circuit.  Under this doctrine, courts apply one of two methods of determining\nreasonable attorneys’ fee awards:  by a percentage of the fund approach; or by the lodestar plus\nmultiplier (“enhanced multiplier”) approach, whereby the reasonable hours expended are\nmultiplied by a reasonable hourly rate, adding a multiplier to account for risk.  Vaszlavik v.\n1 In determining the total amount of the common fund, it is proper to include\nagreed upon fees and costs in addition to class damages.  See, e.g., Staton v. Boeing Co., 327\nF.3d 938, 972 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding that “the parties may negotiate and agree to the value of a\ncommon fund (which will ordinarily include an amount representing an estimated hypothetical\naward of statutory fees) and provide that, subsequently, class counsel will apply to the court for\nan award from the fund, using common fund fee principles.”  (Emphasis added.)); Johnston v.\nComerica Mortgage Corp., 83 F.3d 241, 246 (8th Cir. 1996) (“The award to the class and the\nagreement on attorney fees represent a package deal.  Even if the fees are paid directly to the\nattorneys, those fees are still best viewed as an aspect of the class' recovery.”).\n 6 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 234    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 20\nStorage Tech. Corp., Civ. Action No. 95 B 2525, slip. op. at 2 (D. Colo. March 9, 2000) (citing\nUselton v. Commercial Loveless Motor Freight, Inc., 9 F.3d 849, 853 (10th Cir. 1993) &\nRosenbaum v. MacAllister, 64 F.3d 1439, 1445 (10th Cir. 1995)).  In the Tenth Circuit, there is\n“‘a preference for the percentage of the fund method’ in common fund cases.”  Id. (citations\nomitted).  “The Tenth Circuit has concluded that whichever method for fee calculation is\nemployed, the District Court must consider the 12 factors articulated in Johnson v. Georgia\nHighway Express, Inc., 488 F.2d 714, 717 19 (5th Cir.1974).”  Id. at 3 (citations omitted).\nB. Lodestar Computation.\nThe lodestar is the product of the number of hours reasonably expended on a case and a\nreasonable hourly rate.  See, e.g., Robinson v. City of Edmond, 160 F.3d 1275, 1281 (10th Cir.\n1998).  Class Counsel have submitted detailed billing records, along with the Declaration of\nDarold W. Killmer, an expert on attorneys’ fees.\n1. Reasonable Number of Hours.\nMr. Killmer reviewed fee records, along with Fox & Robertson’s entire case file, including\npleadings and documents.  He found the fee records to be “very detailed, and [to] provide a clear\nbasis for understanding the tasks performed and the time expended for those tasks . . . easily\nmeet[ing] the standards typically required in this judicial district for compensability of time spent.”\nThis litigation has spanned the course of seven years.  During that time, Class Counsel\nhave:  interviewed scores of class members; taken or defended more than 50 depositions;\nreviewed, analyzed and organized over 100,000 pages of documents, in addition to a database\nwith almost 70,000 mystery shopper reports; written or responded to over 15 briefs on the class\n 7 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 234    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 20\ncertification issue alone; briefed the issue of whether, under Rule 23(f), the Tenth Circuit should\naccept an interlocutory appeal of the class certification decision; attempted to have the bankruptcy\nstay lifted; and negotiated the settlement.2\nTo accomplish these tasks, Class Counsel and their staff billed approximately 6,500 hours,\nof which less than 5,000 hours were billed by attorneys.  Fox & Robertson, in the exercise of\nbilling judgment, has reviewed its fee statement and eliminated certain entries.  Finally, Mr.\nKillmer has reviewed Class Counsel’s records and, in his expert opinion, the number of hours\nbilled by Class Counsel in this case is reasonable.\nThis Court finds that the number of hours billed by Class Counsel in this case is\nreasonable.\n2. Reasonable Hourly Rates.\nHourly rates must reflect the prevailing market rates in the relevant community.  Because\nof the significant resources and skill required, as well the risks entailed, to litigate large scale\nactions on behalf of a class, very few attorneys handle such cases.  Thus the relevant community\nfor purposes of determining a reasonable billing rate for Class Counsel likely consists of attorneys\n2 The fact that Plaintiffs were unsuccessful in opposing Kmart’s Rule 23(f) appeal,\nor in lifting the stay, does not preclude Plaintiffs from recovering fees for work done on these\ntasks.  See Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 435 (1983) (Holding that when a plaintiff\nachieves excellent results, “fee award should not be reduced simply because the plaintiff failed to\nprevail on every contention raised in the lawsuit. Litigants in good faith may raise alternative legal\ngrounds for a desired outcome, and the court’s rejection of or failure to reach certain grounds is\nnot a sufficient reason for reducing a fee. The result is what matters.”).  In any event, Class\nCounsel used the research conducted in connection with that unsuccessful motion and appeal in\nmaking their successful argument that this case was not discharged in bankruptcy.\n 8 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 234    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 20\nwho litigate nationwide, complex class actions.  See, e.g., Casey v. City of Cabool, 12 F.3d 799,\n805 (8th Cir. 1994) (“‘A national market or a market for a particular legal specialization may\nprovide the appropriate market.’”  (Quotation omitted.)).  This rate would be significantly higher\nthan the rate prevailing in Denver.  Class Counsel have chosen to take a conservative approach\nand have applied rates applicable in the Denver legal community.\nIn analyzing reasonable hourly rates, Class Counsel have specifically addressed the rates of\nFox & Robertson attorneys, who billed the majority of hours in this case, and have applied\n“blended” rates for all other attorneys, and for paralegals and other staff.\na. Hourly rates for Fox & Robertson attorneys.\nClass Counsel seek a rate of $330 per hour for work performed by Fox & Robertson\nattorneys on the Kmart case.  Class Counsel have submitted the following evidence to establish\nthat this is the prevailing rate in the Denver community:\n! The expert opinion of Mr. Killmer;\n! The hourly rates approved by Colorado federal and state courts in successful\nemployment and civil rights actions over the last several years.\n! A survey conducted by the Colorado Bar Association in 2000 (the “CBA\nSurvey”), reflecting that the top 5% of plaintiff’s employment lawyers (a\nreasonable comparison to the type of work performed in this case) charged $325\nper hour.  In light of the fact that six years have passed since the CBA survey, the\nrate requested here    $330 per hour    is conservative.\nb. Hourly rates of other timekeepers.\n 9 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 234    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of\n 20\nThe other attorneys who worked on the Kmart case on behalf of the class include\nattorneys known nationally for their skill in civil rights and class action cases who would\ncommand the highest rates in any jurisdiction in which they practiced, as well as less experienced\nattorneys.  Class Counsel have applied a blended average rate of $275 per hour for all hours billed\nby non Fox & Robertson attorneys, including partners and associates, which Mr. Killmer opines is\na conservative approach.\nClass Counsel have also applied a blended average rate of $110 per hour for work done by\nparalegals in this case, a rate that Mr. Killmer opines is reasonable for the Denver community.\nThis rate is also supported by the CBA Survey, which found that six years ago, experienced\nparalegals charge between $75 and $120 per hour.\nThis Court finds that the rates applied by Class Counsel are reasonable.  Based on these\nrates and the total hours billed, the total lodestar in this case is $1,734,947.50.\nC. Application of the Johnson Factors.\nThe Johnson factors are: (1) the time and labor required; (2) the novelty and difficulty of\nthe question presented by the case; (3) the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly;\n(4) the preclusion of other employment by the attorneys due to acceptance of the case; (5) the\ncustomary fee; (6) whether the fee is fixed or contingent; (7) any time limitations imposed by the\nclient or the circumstances; (8) the amount involved and the results obtained; (9) the experience,\nreputation and ability of the attorneys; (10) the ‘undesirability’ of the case; (11) the nature and\nlength of the professional relationship with the client; and (12) awards in similar cases.   Johnson,\n488 F.2d at 717 19, cited in Vaszlavik, slip op. at 3.\n 10 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 234    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of\n 20\n1. Time and labor required.\nThis case involved a significant amount of time and labor.  The case took seven years to\nlitigate.  During that time, Class Counsel and their staff billed more than 6,500 hours for work\ndone on this case.  This work included: interviewing, and obtaining declarations from, over 80\nclass members; taking or defending more than 50 depositions across the country; reviewing and\norganizing over 100,000 pages of documents; reviewing and analyzing a database of over 65,000\nmystery shopper reports; writing and responding to numerous briefs on the class certification\nissues, among others; and engaging in extensive settlement negotiations.\n2. Novelty and Difficulty of the Questions Presented by the Case.\n. This case involved several novel and/or difficult issues, including:\n! The appropriate standard in the Tenth Circuit for the grant of an interlocutory\nappeal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(f) of an order granting class certification;\n! Whether the class claims for injunctive relief, attorneys’ fees and costs were\ndischarged by Kmart’s bankruptcy; and\n! Whether merchandise on moveable displays must be on an accessible route at least\n36 inches wide.\n3. Skill Requisite to Perform the Legal Service Properly.\nThis case involved numerous novel and/or difficult legal and factual issues, many of which\nhave not been fully resolved by the courts.  Litigating such issues required a high degree of\nspecialized skill in disability rights law and complex litigation.  See Vaszlavik, slip op. at 3.  It also\n 11 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 234    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of\n 20\nrequired a small firm and co counsel to manage and present a large quantity of documents and\ninformation.\nThe result in this case is outstanding.  The injunctive relief obtained by the class includes\npolicy changes as well as surveys of every Kmart store that will result in the removal of\narchitectural barriers.  To the best of Class Counsel’s knowledge, the damages recovery for the\nDamages Sub Class is larger than in any previous case of this kind.\n4. Preclusion of Other Employment by the Attorneys Due to Acceptance\nof the Case.\n. Large scale class actions such as this case    involving dozens of depositions, over\n100,000 pages of documents, a large database, numerous briefs, and a bankruptcy proceeding   \nnecessarily require a great deal of work, and a concomitant inability to take on other cases.  That\nis particularly true here because most of the work was done by Fox & Robertson, a small firm\nwith only two attorneys at present.\n5. The Customary Fee.\nThe requested fee is reasonable under either the percentage of the fund or enhanced\nlodestar approach.  Class Counsel seek less than 20% of the fund, which is over $1.6 million less\nthan the customary fee award of 30% of the fund under the percentage of the fund approach.  See\nVaszlavik, slip op. at 7; see also 4 Robert Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions § 14:6 at 551 (4th\ned. 2002) (“Empirical studies show that, regardless whether the percentage method or the\nlodestar method is used, fee awards in class actions average around one third of the recovery.”).\n 12 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 234    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of\n 20\nUnder the enhanced lodestar approach, courts typically award multipliers of 2 to 3 times the\nlodestar, whereas Class Counsel here seek only a multiplier of 1.87.  See Vaszlavik, slip op. at 5.\n6. Whether the Fee Is Fixed or Contingent.\nClass Counsel pursued this case based on a contingent fee agreement, and thus they would\nhave recovered nothing if they had not prevailed.  “Given the risk of non recovery, this factor\nweighs heavily in favor of the requested fee.”  Vaszlavik, slip op. at 6.\n7. Any Time Limitations Imposed by the Client or the Circumstances.\nThe size, magnitude and procedural posture of this case imposed significant time\nlimitations on Class Counsel in this case, particularly Fox & Robertson.  The time limitations were\nparticularly significant given the prospect of a substantial delay resulting from the Rule 23(f)\ninterlocutory appeal, lengthy trial and subsequent appeals.\n8. The Amount Involved and the Results Obtained.\nClass Counsel recovered $13 million on behalf of the subclass.  Class Counsel believe that\nthis is the largest recovery in a class action against a public accommodation for disability\ndiscrimination.  Given the significant risk that the plaintiffs would recover nothing for their efforts,\nthis result more than justifies the requested fee.  See Vaszlavik, slip op. at 6.\n9. The Experience, Reputation and Ability of the Attorneys.\nThe Class Counsel in this case include attorneys with national reputations for their work\non disability rights cases, and skill in litigating civil rights and class action cases.  Together the\nresult achieved by Class Counsel is exceptional.\n 13 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 234    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 14 of\n 20\n10. The Undesirability of the Case.\nGiven the risk of no recovery and the unsettled legal issues described above, this was not a\ndesirable case to take.  See Vaszlavik, slip op. at 7.\n11. The Nature and Length of the Professional Relationship with the\nClient.\nThis factor is irrelevant in this case.3\n12. Awards in Similar Cases.\nAs set forth above, the amount of fees requested by Class Counsel is substantially less than\nis typically awarded under either the enhanced lodestar or percentage of the fund approach.\nThis Court finds that the fees requested by Class Counsel are reasonable under Tenth\nCircuit precedent both because the Johnson factors support the request, and because the\nrequested fees are significantly less than the amount of fees typically awarded in common fund\ncases.\nII. Recovery Of Fees Under California Law.\nIn the alternative, the Court grants the Petition under California law.\n3 The Tenth Circuit has recognized that “rarely are all of the Johnson factors\napplicable.”  Brown v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 838 F.2d 451, 456 (10th Cir. 1988).  Fox &\nRobertson, which is one of the few firms in the country that represents plaintiffs in disability rights\nactions, has represented the named plaintiffs in other cases.  This fact does not impact the fees\nanalysis.  See, e.g.,  Ruiz v. Estelle, 553 F. Supp. 567, 594 (S.D. Tex. 1982) (Finding, in\ndiscussing this factor, that “[t]he meaning of this criterion and its effect on the calculation of a\n‘reasonable’ fee has always been unclear. Courts applying to Johnson factors typically state simply\nthat this particular standard is irrelevant or immaterial.”)\n 14 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 234    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of\n 20\nA. Applicability of California Law.\nState law controls both the award of and the reasonableness of fees awarded where state\nlaw supplies the rule of decision.  See, e.g., Vizcaino v. Microsoft Corp., 290 F.3d 1043, 1047\n(9th Cir. 2002) (holding that “[b]ecause Washington law governed the claim, it also governs the\naward of fees.”); Mathis v. Exxon Corp., 302 F.3d 448, 461 (5th Cir. 2002); Pub. Serv. Co. of\nColo. v. Continental Cas. Co., 26 F.3d 1508, 1520 (10th Cir. 1994).  Where, as here, a plaintiff\nsuccessfully obtains benefits for the class under both state and federal claims, fees may be\nawarded under state law.  See, e.g., Mangold v. Cal. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 67 F.3d 1470, 1478 79\n(9th Cir. 1995).  Thus if a plaintiff successfully obtains benefits for a class on a state law claim,\nand state law permits recovery under the common fund or enhanced lodestar doctrines, then the\nplaintiff may seek a fee recovery based on these doctrines.  See, e.g., Mangold, 67 F.3d at\n1478 79 (affirming an award of a fee multiplier based on state law); Vizcaino, 290 F.3d at 1047 \n48 (holding that where a state law claim resulted in a settlement fund, the lower court correctly\napplied the common fund doctrine based on state law.).\nIn this case, Plaintiffs were successful, obtaining benefits for the class on both their federal\nclaim, and their claims under California state law, resulting in a California settlement fund of over\n$12 million.  Thus the requested fee may be approved based on California law.\nB. California Attorneys’ Fee Law.\nWhere, as here, a class action settlement results in a monetary fund for the class, courts\napplying California law blend two doctrines, the enhanced lodestar doctrine and the percentage \nof the benefit doctrine.\n 15 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 234    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 16 of\n 20\nUnder California law,\n[T]he primary method for establishing the amount of “reasonable” attorney fees is the\nlodestar method.  The lodestar (or touchstone) is produced by multiplying the number of\nhours reasonably expended by counsel by a reasonable hourly rate.   Once the court has\nfixed the lodestar, it may increase or decrease that amount by applying a positive or\nnegative “multiplier” to take into account a variety of other factors, including the quality\nof the representation, the novelty and complexity of the issues, the results obtained, and\nthe contingent risk presented.\nLealao v. Beneficial California, Inc., 97 Cal. Rptr. 2d 797, 803 (Cal. Ct. App. 2000).  When a\nclass action settlement includes a common fund, a court should adjust the lodestar multiplier to\nensure that the fee award, as a percentage of the overall common fund, is within the range of fees\nfreely negotiated in the legal marketplace in comparable litigation.  Id. at 821.\nC. Multiplier.\nClass Counsel’s request of a multiplier of 1.87 is well supported by California law.\nCalifornia has a “relatively permissive attitude on the use of multipliers.”  Lealao, 97 Cal.\nRptr. 2d at 815.  Various factors may justify an award of a multiplier, including: (1) the novelty\nand difficulty of the questions involved; (2) the skill displayed in presenting them; (3) the extent to\nwhich the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys; and (4) the\ncontingent nature of the fee award.  Ketchum v. Moses, 104 Cal. Rptr. 2d 377, 384 (Cal. 2001)\n(citation omitted).  A court may then use the percentage of the benefit analysis to “cross check”\nthe propriety of a lodestar fee award.  Lealao, 97 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 817 & n.12.\nThe four factors identified in Ketchum mirror several of the Johnson factors discussed\nabove, and will not be repeated here, with the exception of the contingency risk factor.  California\ncourts place particular emphasis on contingency risk, which is “[o]ne of the most common fee\n 16 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 234    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 17 of\n 20\nenhancers.”  Graham v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., 21 Cal. Rptr. 3d 331, 352 (Cal. 2004).  “‘A\nlawyer who both bears the risk of not being paid and provides legal services is not receiving the\nfair market value of his work if he is paid only for the second of these functions.  If he is paid no\nmore, competent counsel will be reluctant to accept fee award cases.’”  Ketchum, 104 Cal. Rptr.\n2d at 384 (quotation omitted).\nThe case at bar involved significant risk to Class Counsel.  First, as set forth above, this\ncase involved novel issues that, if decided against the class, could have significantly reduced the\nlikelihood that Class Counsel would be paid for their work on this case.\nThe risk to Class Counsel was particularly acute in this case because the Defendant filed\nfor bankruptcy in the middle of the case.  This factor alone justifies a larger multiplier than Class\nCounsel have requested.  See In re Safety Components, Inc. Sec. Litig., 166 F. Supp. 2d 72, 104\n(D.N.J. 2001) (Awarding multiplier of 2.81, in part because class counsel faced a heightened risk\nof nonpayment of fees due to the defendant’s bankruptcy.).\nThe Ketchum factors demonstrate that the 1.87 multiplier requested by Class Counsel is\nreasonable.  Indeed, it is less than multipliers typically awarded in California and elsewhere.  See\nIn re Calif. Indirect Purchaser X Ray Film Antitrust Litig., 1998 WL 1031494 *10 (Cal. Sup. Ct.\n1998) (“Cases from California and other jurisdictions reflect that multipliers of two or more are\ncommonplace in class actions.”);4 see also Vaszlavik, slip op. at 5 (noting that under common\n4 Citing ABS Pipe Cases II, J.C.C.P. No. 3126 (Contra Costa Sup. Ct.) (Orders\nSigned June 24, 1998) (awarding lodestar and multiplier of 2.2 in eight class action settlements\ntogether worth approximately $70,000,000); Wilson v. Bank of America Nat’l Trust & Sav.\nAss’n., No. 643872 (Cal. Sup. Ct. Aug. 16, 1982) (multiplier of 10 times the hourly rate\n 17 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 234    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 18 of\n 20\nfund theory, courts “regularly award multipliers of two to three times the lodestar or more to\ncompensate for risk and to reflect the quality of the work performed.”).\nThe reasonableness of the requested fee is further demonstrated by a cross check with the\npercentage of the benefit approach.  The purpose of this cross check is “to ensure that the fee\nawarded is within the range of fees freely negotiated in the legal marketplace in comparable\nlitigation.”  Lealao, 97 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 821.  “‘The simplest way for the law to duplicate the\nbargain that informed parties would reach . . . is to look to fee award levels in actions brought by\nsophisticated private parties under the same or comparable statutes.’”  Id. at 819 20 (quotation\nomitted).\nAs set forth above, “class action fee awards are typically 30% of the fund created by the\nsettlement.”  Vaszlavik, slip op. at 3; see also 4 Robert Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions\n§ 14:6 at 551 (4th ed. 2002) (“Empirical studies show that, regardless whether the percentage\nmethod or the lodestar method is used, fee awards in class actions average around one third of the\nrecovery.”).  This cross check demonstrates that Class Counsel’s fee request    which represents\nless than 20% of the common fund    is reasonable.\nawarded); Glendora Comm. Redev. Agency v. Demeter, 155 Cal. App. 3d 456, 465 (Cal. Ct.\nApp. 1984) (affirming a 12 times multiplier of counsel’s hourly rate and expressly rejecting the\nargument that the requested fee was exorbitant or unconscionable); In re Trilogy Sec. Litig.,\nC 84 20617(A) (N.D. Cal.1986) (multiplier of 4.37); Underwood v. Pierce, 79 1318 HP (3.5\nmultiplier; $60 million settlement) (C.D. Cal.1983).\n 18 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 234    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 19 of\n 20\nIII. Reasonable Costs.\nUnder both California law and the law of this Circuit, reasonable costs may be awarded to\nsuccessful plaintiffs in a class action.  See Cal. Code Civ. P. § 1032(b); Vaszlavik, slip op. at 7\n(“As with attorneys’ fees, an attorney who creates or preserves a common fund for the benefit of\na class is entitled to receive reimbursement of all reasonable costs incurred.”).  Plaintiffs are also\nentitled to an award of costs because they successfully obtained benefits for the class on their\nclaims under the ADA.  42 U.S.C. § 12205.\nClass Counsel have submitted detailed records of their costs to date, which total\n$123,312.56.  In addition, they anticipate that additional costs relating to the Final Approval\nHearing will result in total costs in excess of $125,000.\nThis Court finds that the costs incurred by Class Counsel to date are reasonable, and\napproves an award of $123,312.56 for costs incurred through July 21, 2006.  The Court also\napproves an award of  reasonable costs incurred after that date and prior to the date of final\napproval, not to exceed $125,000.\nIV. Fees And Costs For Implementing And Monitoring The Settlement Agreement.\nKmart has agreed to pay Class Counsel’s reasonable fees and costs relating to\nimplementing and monitoring the Agreement after final approval.  Payment of such fees and costs\nis appropriate.  See Diaz v. Romer, 961 F.2d 1508, 1511 (10th Cir. 1992) (Holding that\n“attorney’s fees can be awarded for post judgment monitoring and other efforts to ensure\ncompliance with court orders in a civil rights case.”).  The Court hereby approves the payment of\n 19 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS   Document 234    Filed 07/27/06   USDC Colorado   Page 20 of\n 20\nClass Counsel’s reasonable fees and costs relating to implementing and monitoring the Agreement\nafter final approval.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons set forth above, this Court  grants the Petition, and approves: (1) an award\nof attorneys’ fees through the date on which final approval is granted of $3.25 million; (2) an\naward of costs incurred through July 21, 2006 of $123,312.56, plus additional reasonable costs\nincurred after that date and prior to the date of final approval, with total costs not to exceed\n$125,000; and (3) an award of reasonable fees and costs relating to implementing and monitoring\nthe Agreement after final approval.\nDated:  July 27, 2006 John L.

A\nparent, legal guardian or next of kin may complete and sign a Claim\nForm on behalf of a minor.  A designated representative may complete\nand sign a Claim Form on behalf of a claimant who, because of\ndisability, cannot sign his or her name.

All Claim Forms must be mailed to the Claims\nAdministrator and postmarked by no later than the date that is twenty\n(20) days after the final approval hearing.\n15.4.3 Review of Claim Forms.  The Claims Administrator shall initially\nreview all Claim Forms to determine if the form is filled out completely\nand is signed properly.  If the Claim Form is incomplete or is not signed\nproperly, the Claims Administrator shall return the Claim Form to the\nclaimant and the claimant shall be given thirty (30) days from the date of\nthat mailing within which to return to the Claims Administrator the\nClaim Form completed and/or signed properly.

If the Claims Administrator rejects a claim as not\nmeeting the terms or provisions of this Agreement, the Administrator\nshall so notify the claimant in writing. \nLucas v. Kmart Corp.\nCivil Action No. 99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS (D. Colo.)\nSettlement Agreement Page 31\n\n15.4.7 Deadline for Administrator Review of All Claims.

All determinations of the Claims\nAdministrator shall be final, binding, and non-appealable.  Kmart shall\nhave no responsibility for or role in the claims determination process.\n15.5 Class Monetary Distribution.  \n15.5.1 The purpose of this Paragraph is to distribute the Damages Sub-Class\nFund by: (a) determining the State Specific Fund for each Statutory\nMinimum Damages State; and (b) distributing each State Specific Fund\nto Eligible Claimants who visited Kmart Stores or Closed Kmart Stores\nin that state.\n15.5.2 Determining State Specific Funds.\n15.5.2.1 The purpose of this Paragraph is to determine the State\nSpecific Fund for each Statutory Minimum Damages State in\na manner that reflects the number of Kmart Stores and Closed\nKmart Stores in each Statutory Minimum Damages State, and\nthe Statutory Minimum Damages Amount in each Statutory\nMinimum Damages State.\n15.5.2.2 To accomplish this purpose, each Statutory Minimum\nDamages State will be assigned a “Factorial,” which is the\nproduct of the number of Kmart Stores and Closed Kmart\nStores in that state times that state’s Statutory Minimum\nDamages Amount.  For example, there are 130 Kmart Stores\nand Closed Kmart Stores in California, and California’s\nMinimum Statutory Damages Amount is $4,000.  Thus the\nCalifornia Factorial is 520,000 (the product of 130 times\n4,000).  The percentage of the Damages Sub-Class Fund\nallocated to a Statutory Minimum Damages State is\ndetermined by dividing that state’s Factorial by the combined\nsum of the Factorials of all Statutory Minimum Damages\nStates.  Exhibit 8 sets forth the Factorials and the State\nSpecific Funds for each Statutory Minimum Damages State.\n15.5.3 Distribution of State Specific Funds.\nLucas v. Kmart Corp.\nCivil Action No. 99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS (D. Colo.)\nSettlement Agreement Page 32\n\n15.5.3.1 Each State Specific Fund will be distributed only to Eligible\nClaimants who visited one or more Kmart Stores or Closed\nKmart Stores in that State, or to the designated Cy Pres\nrecipient for that State Specific Fund as set forth in Paragraph\n15.6.  \n15.5.3.2 For each Qualifying Visit to a Kmart Store or Closed Kmart\nStore located in a Statutory Minimum Damages State, an\nEligible Claimant shall receive from that State Specific Fund\na pro rata award worth up to the state’s Statutory Minimum\nDamages Amount. \n15.5.3.3 The maximum number of visits to Kmart Stores or Closed\nKmart Stores for which an Eligible Claimant may obtain\nrecovery is two (2).  An Eligible Claimant who has been to\nKmart Stores or Closed Kmart Stores in more than one\nStatutory Minimum Damages State will obtain recovery from\nthe State Specific Fund with the greatest Statutory Minimum\nDamages Amount.  By way of illustration, an Eligible\nClaimant who made four (4) Qualifying Visits to Kmart\nStores in California, and four (4) Qualifying Visits to Kmart\nStores in Colorado, would obtain a pro rata recovery from the\nCalifornia Specific Fund for two (2) California visits because\nthe California Statutory Minimum Damages Amount is\ngreater than the Colorado Statutory Minimum Damages\nAmount. \n15.5.3.4 To the extent that the claims submitted and found to be\neligible with respect to a State Specific Fund exceed the\namount of the State Specific Fund, the Claims Administrator\nshall make pro rata reductions in the awards from that State\nSpecific Fund.\n15.5.3.5 Eligible Claimants may express a preference for receiving\ntheir award in cash or in Gift Cards.  The Claims\nAdministrator shall take such elections into consideration to\nthe extent reasonably possible.  The Claims Administrator’s\ndistribution formula, allocation determinations, and award\namounts shall be final and binding on all class members and\nnot subject to appeal.\n15.5.3.6 No later than ten (10) days after the deadline for completion\nof the claims determination process set forth in Paragraph\n15.4.7, the Claims Administrator shall provide Class Counsel\nLucas v.

Each Gift Card shall\nbe issued in increments of twenty-five (25) dollars or fifty\n(50) dollars with some minimum number of Gift Cards being\nissued in a lesser amount for purposes of rounding.  Kmart\nwill forward the Gift Cards to the Claims Administrator\nwithin thirty (30) days of receiving the list from the Claims\nAdministrator.\n15.5.3.7 Not later than ten (10) business days after receiving the Gift\nCards from Kmart, the Claims Administrator shall cause to\nbe mailed, via certified mail, return receipt requested, checks\nand/or Gift Cards in the amounts specified in the claims\ndetermination process, and 1099 forms to Eligible Claimants. \nAll checks shall be negotiable for no more than one (1) year\nfrom the date of mailing.  Gift Cards shall have no expiration\ndate.\n15.5.3.8 All returned checks and Gift Cards of claimants for whom no\nadditional address is obtained shall be held by the Claims\nAdministrator for sixty (60) days.  If no claim is made for\nsuch checks or Gift Cards during this time period, the funds\nfrom such checks and half of the Gift Cards (by value) shall\nbecome part of the funds to be allocated to the Cy Pres and\ndistributed in accordance with Paragraph 15.6 of this\nAgreement.  The other half of such Gift Cards (by value)\nshall be cancelled.\n15.6 Cy Pres.  \n15.6.1 In the event that any portion of a State Specific Fund has not been\ndistributed as provided for by this Agreement after a period of four\nhundred (400) days has elapsed from the date on which settlement\nchecks are mailed by the Claims Administrator, then such remaining\namounts shall be used first to pay any otherwise valid claims against that\nState Specific Fund that were excluded from the Class Monetary\nDistribution through error or omission of the Claims Administrator.  If,\nafter such further actions, Gift Cards or funds that were available to be\ndistributed through Gift Cards still have not been distributed, Kmart may\ncancel half the total value of such remaining Gift Cards or amount\navailable to be distributed through Gift Cards and shall release half the\nLucas v. Kmart Corp.\nCivil Action No. 99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS (D. Colo.)\nSettlement Agreement Page 34\n\namount remaining in the Gift Card Fund attributable to the relevant State\nSpecific Fund.

Kmart Corp.\nCivil Action No. 99-cv-01923-JLK-CBS (D. Colo.)\nSettlement Agreement Page 35\n\nthe Claims Administrator.  Opt-Out Statements must be postmarked and mailed to\nthe Claims Administrator not later than sixty (60) days after the Notice Deadline\nset by the Court.  The Opt-Out Statement shall, at minimum, contain the\nfollowing language:\nI wish to opt out of the monetary portion of the settlement of this case.  I\nunderstand that by requesting to be excluded from the class monetary\nsettlement, I will receive no money or Gift Cards from the settlement\nfunds created in accordance with the Agreement entered into by Kmart.  I\nunderstand that if I am excluded from the class monetary settlement, I may\nbring a separate action seeking damages.  I understand that in any separate\nlawsuit, I may receive nothing or less than I would have received if I had\nfiled a claim under the monetary provisions of this Agreement.  I also\nunderstand that I may not seek exclusion from the non-monetary relief set\nforth in the Agreement, and that I will be bound by the class injunctive\nprovisions of the Agreement entered into by Kmart if the Agreement is\napproved by the Court.\n16.2 To the extent a potential Damages Settlement Sub-Class Member submits an Opt-\nOut Statement with language that differs from the foregoing, either party reserves\nthe right to seek review of the Court to have the Opt-Out Statement declared valid\nor invalid.  All potential Damages Settlement Sub-Class Members who do not\ntimely opt out of the damages provisions of this Agreement shall be bound by the\nresolution of any and all issues arising in connection with the Damages Settlement\nSub-Class claims for damages and attorneys’ fees.\n16.3 No Settlement Class Member may opt out of the injunctive relief provisions of\nthis Agreement.  No Named Plaintiff may opt out of any of the provisions of this\nAgreement.\n16.4 The Claims Administrator shall stamp the date received on the original of any\nOpt-Out Statement it receives and serve copies of the Statement on Class Counsel\nand Kmart’s counsel not later than three (3) business days after receipt thereof and\nshall file the date-stamped originals of any Opt-Out Statements with the Clerk of\nthe Court not later than ten (10) business days prior to the date set for the final\napproval hearing.
