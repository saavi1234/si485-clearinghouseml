    "summary": "<p>On October 3, 2008, a UCLA Law School professor, a former governor of the California State Bar, and the California First Amendment Coalition (a nonprofit public interest group) filed a lawsuit under California's common law right of access to court records and Proposition 59 (a California ballot measure passed in 2004 endorsing the public's right of access to information) against the State Bar of California and its governing body, the Board of Governors of the State Bar, in the San Francisco County Superior Court.  The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, filed a petition for a writ of mandate seeking data from Defendants pertaining to applicants for the California Bar exam, including the applicants' race, law schools attended, year graduated from law school, Bar passage rate, and exam scores from their law schools and from the LSAT. (The complaint filed in this case is not available).  </p><p>The parties agreed that the data should be treated as in the possession of the judicial branch and as subject to disclosure to the extent documents in the possession of the courts must be made publicly available. The plaintiffs sought this data to further the scholarly work of the professor plaintiff.</p><p>On April 13, 2010, the Court (Judge Curtis E.A. Karnow) denied the plaintiffs' petition for writ of mandate.  The Court found that the plaintiffs' contentions reduced to the assertion that they were entitled to \"public documents,\" but they were unable to articulate a principled definition of the entitlement, except for an overly broad interpretation that included all information in the possession of a public agency.  Judge Karnow held that the law applicable to the courts before Proposition 59 was enacted was not that broad, and that there is no evidence that Prop 59 was intended to create such a \"radical change.\"</p><p>On May 20, 2010, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the California Court of Appeal.  This appeal record was certified to the Court of Appeal on June 22, 2010.</p><p>Oral argument was held in front of the Court of Appeal on June 1, 2011. On June 10, 2011, the Court of Appeal reversed the trial court opinion and remanded it for further consideration. Specifically, the Court said that the common law right of access to public documents was broader than the First Amendment right of access to adjudicatory court documents. The trial court was ordered to balance the interest in confidentiality and the burden the request imposed on the Bar against the strong public policy favoring disclosure. </p><p>The respondents filed for rehearing on June 23, 2011; it was denied on July 11, 2011. On July 20, 2011, the respondents filed a petition for review in the Supreme Court of California, which was granted on August 26, 2011. The parties had oral argument in front of the Supreme Court of California on October 9, 2013, and the Court issued an opinion on December 19, 2013. The Supreme Court of California affirmed the Court of Appeal decision and directed the Court of Appeal to remand the case to the trial court. </p><p>On February 11, 2014, the plaintiffs filed a peremptory challenge against Judge Karnow, which was granted. On July 10, 2014, Judge Marla Miller of the Superior Court of San Francisco denied the plaintiffs' motion for interim attorney fees but granted the plaintiffs $6,336.01 in appellate costs. </p><p>After remanding the case to the Superior Court, the parties engaged in discovery. On January 1, 2016, the California Legislature enacted Senate Bill 387, which provided, among other things, that \"State Bar admission records . . . shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed pursuant to any state law, including . . . the California Public Records Act.\" In response, the respondents filed a motion for judgement on the pleadings. </p><p>On April 12, 2016, Judge Mary E. Wiss of the Superior Court issued an opinion denying the respondents' motion for judgement on the pleadings. The opinion said that the relevant section of Senate Bill 387 prohibited the disclosure only of identifying information, so the court must determine whether the information sought by the petitioners could be produced without disclosing any identifying information. </p><p>This case is ongoing. </p>",

Woods; and \n4  Doe I (collectively, \"Intervenors\"), file this complaint and thereby intervene in this action. \n5  Intervenors join with Respondents in opposing Petitioners' claims, alleging as follows: \n6  1.  On or about October 3, 2008, Petitioners Richard Sander, Joe Hicks, and \n7  the California First Amendment Coalition filed the Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate, or in \n8  the Alternative, Complaint for Declaratory Relief and Injunctive Relief, in the above-entitled \n9  action against Respondents State Bar of California and the Board of Governors ofthe State Bar \n10  of California.  Petitioners seek an order compelling Respondents to disclose information \n11  contained within personal documents and information collected by the State Bar of Califomia \n12  concerning applicants for the California Bar Examination. Respondents have appeared in this \n13  action by filing an Answer on or about November 17, 2008. \n14  THE PARTIES \n15  2.  Intervenors are individuals who applied to take the California Bar Exam \n16  between 1972 and the present.  Intervenors are alumni of law schools including Stanford Law \n17  School, Berkeley School of Law (Boalt Hall), UCLA School of Law, UC Hastings College of the \n18  Law, and Santa Clara University School of Law.  The group of Intervenors consists of \n19  predominantly persons who are African American and Latino, but also includes persons of other \n20  racial backgrounds. \n21  3.  Intervenors are informed and believe and thereon allege that Petitioner \n22  Richard Sander (\"Sander\") is an individual who resides in California and a professor of law at \n23  the University of California Los Angeles. \n24  4.  Intervenors are informed and believe and thereon allege that Petitioner Joe \n25  Hicks is an individual who resides in California. \n26  5.  Petitioner California First Amendment Coalition is incorporated under the \n27  laws of the State of California and purports to be organized and existing as required by law, with \n28  its principal place of business in California. \nCase No.: CPF-08-508880 \nCOMPLAINT IN INTERVENTION \n\n1  6.  Respondent State Bar of California (\"State Bar\") is a public corporation \n2  within the judicial branch of the California state government. \n3  7.  Respondent Board of Governors of the State Bar of California (\"Board of \n4  Governors\") is the governing body of the State Bar. \n5  INTRODUCTION \n6  8.  Intervenors seek to intervene to protect privacy and reputational interests \n7  that are at the heart of the litigation between Petitioners and the State Bar.  In particular, it is \n8  Intervenors' sensitive, private information that stands to be exposed if Petitioners prevail in this \n9  action. Intervenors were explicitly guaranteed that the information they provided would be kept \n10  confidential, and Intervenors relied on these guarantees when providing the information to the \n11  State Bar.  If the information were to be disclosed to Petitioners without Intervenors' consent, \n12  such disclosure would violate Intervenors' rights to privacy under the California Constitution and \n13  tbe Family Education and Privacy Rights Act (\"FERPA\"), 20 U.S.C. § l232g, and would breach \n14  Intervenors' contractual rights to keep their personal academic and professional data private. \n15  9.  Petitioners contend that the State Bar and the Board of Governors are \n16  required to disclose information concerning applicants for the California Bar Exam over a year \n17  period.  The information sought includes, among other data, law school grades, Law School \n18  Admissions Test (LSAT\") scores, undergraduate grades, Bar Exam scores, and race for each of \n19  the applicants.  Petitioners allege that they seek this information for their personal research \n20  concerning the effect of law school affirmative action admissions policies on persons of color \n21  who were admitted to law school and who applied to take the California Bar Examination. \n22  Sander in particular seeks this infonnation to argue that African-American and Latino law \n23  students who were admitted under affirmative action type processes to law schools, particularly \n24  \"upper tier\" and \"middle tier\" law schools, were \"mismatched\" and perform poorly in law school \n25  and on the Bar Exam, and in their professional careers. \n26  I 0.  Intervenors have a direct interest in this dispute because Intervenors' \n27  private academic and professional information will be exposed if Petitioners\" request is granted. \n28  Intervenors have a strong interest in preventing the public release of private academic and testing \n2 \nCase No.: CPF-08-508880 \nCOMPLAINT IN INTERVENTION \n\n1  information. The information at issue in this lawsuit is highly sensitive and disclosure in the \n2  manner Petitioners seek would have a detrimental effect on Intervenors.  Intervenors are \n3  informed and believe that the risk of harm to Intervenors is especially grave because Petitioner \n4  Sander intends to couple Intervenors' private data with a discussion of his \"mismatch\" theory, \n5  which calls into question the competence of African-American and Latino applicants for the \n6  California Bar Exam, and suggests that such individuals were admitted to law schools that they \n7  were unqualified to attend.  Moreover, the issue is not just exposure in a general sense but also \n8  that the law prohibits the disclosure of this information absent Intervenors' consent, which has \n9  not been sought and which they have not given. \n10  II.  Intervenors relied upon promises of confidentiality when they provided \n11  much of the information to the State Bar that Petitioners seek.  If Respondents are ordered to \n12  provide the information, these promises will be broken and Intervenors' highly sensitive personal \n13  information will be disclosed to members of the general public, including Petitioners, against \n14  Intervenors' wishes. \n15  12.  Redacting information to remove individuals' names and the other \n16  procedures that Petitioners propose to use will not adequately address Intervenors' privacy \n17  interests, nor will it adequately protect Intervenors ti·om being associated with inaccurate, \n18  damaging, misleading, inflammatory and embarrassing representations about their academic and \n19  professional credentials.  The problem is that even aggregating or \"anonymizing\" this data does \n20  not protect the Intervenors from beiug re-identified.  This is particularly so because they are \n21  members of small groups or cohorts that make their identities easily traceable.  In short, the \n22  removal of this infonnation does not protect privacy. \n23  13.  Intervenors' privacy rights protect them against disclosure ofthe \n24  information.  Intervenors object to the disclosure of the information that Petitioners seek, and \n25  respectfully request that the Court dismiss Petitioners' request, or, in the alternative, affirm the \n26  carefully-made decision of the State Bar and the Board of Governors to refuse to disclose the \n27  information sought by Petitioners. \n28 \n3 \nCase No.: CPF-08-508880 \nCOMPLAINT IN INTERVENTION \n\n1  FACTS \n2  14.  In connection with their applications to take the California Bar \n3  Examination, Intervenors provided to the State Bar, or authorized to be provided, private \n4  information concerning Intervenors' race and ethnic backgrounds, academic records, \n5  standardized test scores, and other matters. Intervenors released this information to the State Bar \n6  for the limited purpose of evaluating their respective eligibility for admission to the State Bar.  In \n7  providing this information, Intervenors received written assurances that the information would be \n8  treated as confidential and used for the State Bar's internal purposes only.  Based on these \n9  assurances, Intervenors reasonably believed that the information would only be used in \n10  accordance with these assurances and would not be released to any party outside the State Bar. \n11  15.  When Intervenors applied to take the Bar Exam, they signed an \n12  authorization provided by the State Bar to allow the State Bar to collect their personal \n13  information for the limited purpose of processing of their applications to become members of the \n14  State Bar. \n15  16.  Also in connection with their applications to take the Bar Exam, each of \n16  the Intervenors were asked to complete a voluntary survey requesting information about his or \n17  her ethnic background.  The preface to the survey promised that this information would be \n18  treated as confidentiaL  Absent this promise of confidentiality, many of the Intervenors would \n19  not have provided this information. \n20  17.  Intervenors authorized their law schools to release their law school Grade \n21  Point Averages (\"GP A\") to the State Bar for the limited purpose of evaluating their application \n22  to the State Bar.  In providing this information, and in keeping with the requirements of FERPA, \n23  Intervenors understood that the State Bar would not disclose this information to any other party \n24  without Intervenors' prior consent \n25  18.  Intervenors authorized the Law School Admissions Council (\"LSAC\") to \n26  release their LSA T scores to the State Bar for the limited purpose of evaluating their application \n27  to the State Bar.  In authorizing the limited release of this information, Intervenors understood \n28  that the State Bar would use the information for internal purposes only. \n4 \nCase No.: CPF-08-508880 \nCOMPLAINT IN INTERVENTION \n\n1  19.  Intervenors wish to keep the foregoing information private and do not \n2  consent to its disclosure outside the State Bar. \n3  20.  On information and belief, Petitioners are pursuing a course of academic \n4  study entitled \"Project SEAPHE,\" under which they seek to study the effects of what Petitioners \n5  call \"preferential admissions policies,\" including law school admissions policies, upon people of \n6  color.  Petitioner Sander's thesis is that a \"mismatch effect\" exists as a result of the so-called \n7  \"preferential admissions policies,\" by which African-American, Latino, and other \n8  underrepresented minority students are admitted to law schools where they purportedly are not \n9  academically qualified to compete and, as a result, the students of color receive lower grades in \n10  law school, pass the Bar Exam at lower rates, and are less successful in their legal careers. \n11  21.  On information and belief, to further their research, Petitioners have \n12  submitted a series of requests to the State Bar, beginning in September 2006, and sought several \n13  pieces of information from the State Bar concerning Intervenors and other applicants for the \n14  California Bar Exam from 1972 to 2007 (the \"Applicants\").  The information Petitioners have \n15  sought in their series of requests includes data on Applicants' race, gender, undergraduate GPA, \n16  LSAT score, graduating law school, matriculating law school, year of law school graduation, law \n17  school GP A, date of Bar Exam(s) taken, total raw and scaled Bar Exam scores, raw and scaled \n18  scores for the essay portion of the Bar Exam, raw and scaled scores for the performance test \n19  portion of the Bar Exam, raw and scaled scores for the Multi-State Bar Examination (\"MBE\"), \n20  and whether the Applicants passed the Bar Exam.  Petitioners have submitted multiple requests, \n21  each time modifying the exact information sought. \n22  22.  As currently fi·amed, Petitioners seek disclosure of the Applicants' race, \n23  law school, transfer student status, year of law school graduation, total raw score on the first Bar \n24  Exam, MBE score (raw and scaled), essay scores (raw and scaled), performance test scores (raw \n25  and scaled), Bar passage, law school GP A, LSATscore, and undergraduate GPA.  In fact, \n26  because Petitioners request the Applicants' scores on the Bar Exam, they seek information about \n27  Applicants that even Applicants themselves cannot access. \n28 \n5 \nCase No.: CPF-08-508880 \nCOMPLAINT IN INTERVENTION \n\n1  23.  Intervenors are aware that following the release of Bar Exam results, the \n2  State Bar publishes statistics showing the pass rates of various groups, including statistics \n3  showing pass rate by law school and pass rate by ethnic group.  However, the information \n4  Petitioners seek in the instant action would identify each individual by several more specific \n5  variables than are identified in the information the State Bar publishes.  For example, while the \n6  State Bar may release one figure depicting Bar pass rates by school, and another tlgure depicting \n7  Bar pass rates by race that groups by schools' accreditation status (i.e., ABA accredited, \n8  California Accredited, etc.), Petitioners seek data describing several more specitlc characteristics \n9  by individual.  As a result, the combination of variables pertaining to each individual would \n10  result in a much more specific profile of each individual, and disclosure according to Petitioners' \n11  request would be much more likely to expose individuals' sensitive, private information. \n12  24.  The State Bar's published figures are also not comparable to the \n13  information requested by Petitioners because the State Bar's figures do not identify scores on the \n14  Bar Exam, but merely passage and failure rates.  Here, Petitioners seek individual-level Bar \n15  Exam scores, a significantly more invasive request.  Intervenors are aware that at times the State \n16  Bar's released tlgures depict passage or failure rates for categories coutaining only a small \n17  number of individuals, such that if a party reading the published figures were aware of the \n18  identity of the Applicant(s) in the small group, the party could identify whether the Applicant(s) \n19  passed or failed the Bar Exam. However, because the State Bar publishes the names of \n20  Applicants who pass the Bar Exam, a member of the public who knows the identity of an \n21  individual Applicant may already verify whether that Applicant passed the Bar Exam; the State \n22  Bar's released figures in effect provide no new information. By contrast, no member of the \n23  public-not even Applicants themselves-may independently verify an Applicant's score on the \n24  Bar Exam. \n25  25.  On information and belief, Intervenors are generally aware that the State \n26  Bar has itself conducted studies of bar passage rates of Applicants of different racial \n27  backgrounds. However, Intervenors understand that these studies were conducted and considered \n28 \n6 \nCase No.: CPF-08-508880 \nCOMPLAINT IN INTERVENTION \n\n1  internally and did not involve disclosures to third parties that would violate Applicants' limited \n2  consent to disclosure of information. \n3  26.  On information and belief, Intervenors are generally aware that the State \n4  Bar has provided information in some of the categories Petitioners now seck to the LSAC for the \n5  LSAC's research purposes.  Intervenors understand that prior to disclosure of private infonnation \n6  the LSAC obtained signed consents from the Applicants whose data it received. \n7  27.  On information and belief, Petitioners have sought and obtained \n8  information from the Office of the President of the University of California (\"UCOP\") regarding \n9  undergraduates at several University of California campuses, and that information includes \n10  students' grade point averages and racial backgrounds.  The decision of a separate institution \n11  whether or not to provide a different set of information in response to a different request from \n12  Petitioners does not control whether the State Bar is required to respond to Petitioners' request \n13  here, and does not discharge the State Bar from following the law, particularly where it has \n14  obtained the information pursuant to an express promise not to disclose it.  ln addition, \n15  Petitioners' request to UCOP is distinguishable from the request here.  First, given the vastly \n16  greater number of students enrolled as undergraduates in the University of California system as \n17  compared to the number oflaw school graduates taking the Bar Exam, the potential for \n18  individual identification would be much greater here.  ln addition, Intervenors are informed and \n19  believe that Petitioners' request to UCOP sought only information that is also available to the \n20  students themselves.  By contrast, Petitioners seek Bar Exam scores, which are not even \n21  available to Applicants themselves. Further, Intervenors are informed and believe that UCOP \n22  was unwilling to identify African American and Latino students in separate groups, opting \n23  instead to categorize all such students under the less-specific label of \"underrepresented \n24  minorities,\" and also refused to comply with Petitioners' request in several other respects. \n25  Moreover, there are Intervenors and members of the group whose information is sought by \n26  Petitioners who were not graduates of any public university. \n27  28.  The State Bar and the Board of Governors have declined to release the \n28  information Petitioners seek. \n7 \nCase No.: CPF-08-508880 \nCOMPLAINT IN INTERVENTION \n\n1  29.  On information and belief, during the period the State Bar was considering \n2  Petitioners' request for information, many individuals, including Applicants whose private data \n3  was subject to disclosure, provided written comments opposing disclosure of the requested \n4  information to Petitioners.  Accordingly, Intervenors believe that many additional Applicants \n5  also object to the disclosure of their personal information to Petitioners. \n6  MANDATORY INTERVENTION-CODE CIV. PROC. § 387(b) \n7  30.  Intervenors incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 29 above. \n8  3!.  As shown by the facts alleged above, Intervenors have a right to intervene \n9  in this action because Intervenors have an interest in the transaction that is the subject of the \n10  pending case, Intervenors' ability to protect their interests may be impaired or impeded by the \n11  disposition of this case in their absence, Intervenors' interests are not adequately represented by \n12  the existing parties in this action, and Intervenors have made timely application to intervene. \n13  PERMISSIVE INTERVENTION-CODE CIV. PROC. § 387(a) \n14  32.  Intervenors incorporate by reference paragraphs l through 31 above. \n15  33.  As shown by the facts alleged above, Intervenors should be permitted to \n16  intervene because Intervenors have a direct and significant interest in this lawsuit, Intervenors' \n17  inclusion will not enlarge the scope of this lawsuit, Intervenors' need to intervene outweighs the \n18  current parties' right to litigate on their own terms, and Intervenors have made timely application \n19  to intervene. \n20  DISCLOSURE OF THE DATA SOUGHT BY PETITIONERS WOULD VIOLATE \nINTERVENORS' PRIVACY RIGHTS UNDER ARTICLE I, SECTION 1 OF THE \n21 \nCALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION \n22  34.  Intervenors incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 33 above. \n23  35.  Disclosure of the information Petitioners seek would violate Intervenors' \n24  privacy rights under A1iicle I, section I of the California Constitution. \n25  36.  A cause of action for invasion of privacy has three elements: \"(I) a \n26  Legally protected privacy interest; (2) a reasonable expectation of privacy in the circumstances; \n27  and (3) conduct by defendant constituting a serious invasion of privacy.\" (Hill v. Nat'! Collegiate \n28 \n8 \nCase No.: CPF-08-508880 \nCOMPLAINT IN INTERVENTION \n\n1  Athletic Ass 'n ( 1994) 7 Cal. 4th 1, 35, 39-40. All three criteria are met here. Further, Intervenors' \n2  privacy rights outweigh any countervailing interest Petitioners have in obtaining the information. \n3  37.  \"A particular class of information is private when well-established social \n4  norms recognize the need to maximize individual control over its dissemination and use to \n5  prevent unjustified embarrassment or indignity.\" Jd. at 35. \n6  38.  The information sought here has long been recognized as private. \n7  Petitioners seek disclosure of Applicants' undergraduate and law school academic records; \n8  academic records are \"normally recognized as warranting protection from disclosure.\"  (Pantos \n9  v.  City & Cnty. ofSan Francisco (1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 258, 264.)  In Parten v. University of \n10  San Francisco ( 1976) 64 Cal. App. 3d 825, the plaintiff alleged that his university violated his \n11  constitutional right to privacy by disclosing his grades from his previous university to the State \n12  Scholarship and Loan Commission. Recognizing that the allegedly disclosed information was \n13  protected by the right of privacy, the court found that the plaintiff stated a primafacie claim of \n14  violation of the state constitutional right to privacy.  (!d. at 832.)  The privacy of academic \n15  information is also recognized by and strictly protected by federal law under FERPA, as set forth \n16  below. \n17  39.  Individuals' LSAT and Bar Exam scores are likewise private. Individuals' \n18  personnel records are protected by the right of privacy.  (Harding Lawson Assocs. v. Super. Ct. \n19  (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 7, 10.)  LSAT and Bar Exam scores, which measure academic and \n20  professional ability, are akin to both private academic records and personnel records (such as \n21  performance evaluations) and are thus protected by the right of privacy.  That this information \n22  has been recognized as private cannot be open to serious dispute, as the State Bar restricts access \n23  to Bar Exam scores to such a high degree that Applicants themselves may not even access this \n24  information.  (Rules of the State Bar of California, Rule 4.62 [Cal. State Bar].) \n25  40.  Intervenors had, and continue to have, a reasonable expectation that the \n26  information Petitioners seek will remain cont!dential because they were explicitly guaranteed \n27  that the infonnation they provided would be kept confidential.  In Hill. the Supreme Court found \n28  that one factor that may diminish an individual's reasonable expectation of privacy is whether \n9 \nCase No.: CPF-08-508880 \nCOMPLAINT IN INTERVENTION \n\n1  the individual has had advance notice of the potential privacy invasion and the opportunity to \n2  consent.  (See Hill, 7 Cal.4th at 42.)  Here, not only did Intervenors receive no advance notice \n3  and opportunity to consent to disclosure, they were expressly promised the opposite.  Intervenors \n4  provided their private information to the State Bar in reliance on these promises. \n5  4 I.  Intervenors are informed and believe that the State Bar suggested that \n6  Petitioners obtain written consent to disclosure from the Applicants, but that Petitioners rejected \n7  this notion. \n8  42.  Intervenors' reasonable expectation of privacy is not diminished by the \n9  fact that they provided the information at issue to the State Bar, an arm of the California \n10  Supreme Court. \"Courts do have the inherent power to control their own records to ... protect the \n11  public from injury.\"  (Pantos,  I5I Cal.App.3d at 262.)  In Panto.1·, questionnaires completed by \n12  prospective jurors and containing private information were not subject to public disclosure.  In \n13  finding that a member of the public did not have the right to access the jury questionnaires for \n14  research purposes, the court noted that the questionnaires were not historically disclosed to the \n15  public and that the jury commissioner had represented to the prospective jurors that the \n16  information provided would be treated as confidentiaL  (Jd. at 263.)  Similarly, individuals' \n17  academic records and LSAT and Bar Exam scores have not been historically disclosed to \n18  members of the public without advanced consent, and the State Bar assured Intervenors that this \n19  information, as well as the voluntarily-provided racial information, would not be disclosed. \n20  43.  Disclosure in the manner Petitioners seek would constitute a serious \n21  invasion oflntervenors' privacy rights.  It is well-established that private information disclosed \n22  for one purpose may not be disclosed for another purpose without individuals' consent.  In \n23  creating the constitutionally-protected right to privacy, the proponents of the amendment stated, \n24  \"[t]he right of privacy ... prevents government and business interests from collecting and \n25  stockpiling unnecessary information about us and from misusing information gathered for one \n26  purpose in order to serve other purposes or to embarrass us.\"  (Hill, 7 Cal. 4th at 17.)  As part of \n27  this guarantee, the constitutional right to privacy protects against \"the improper use of \n28  information properly obtained for a specific purpose, for example, the use of it for another \n10 \nCase No.: CPF-08-508880 \nCOMPLAINT IN INTERVENTION \n\n1  purpose or the disclosure of it to some third party.\"  (Parten. 64 Cal.App.3d at 830; see also \n2  Urbaniakv.  Newton (1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 1128, 1138; Payton v.  City ofSanta Clara (1982) \n3  132 Cal.App.3d 152, 154.)  Intervenors provided their private information to the State Bar for the \n4  limited purpose of applying to become members.  Petitioners' request for, and proposed use of, \n5  the information sought is inconsistent with the conditions under which Intervenors provided the \n6  information at issue, and the information cannot and should not be disclosed without Intervenors' \n7  consent. \n8  44.  Petitioners incorrectly contend that there is no privacy violation because \n9  they do not seek disclosure of the Applicants' names and propose certain other measures to \n10  decrease the risk of identification, such as requesting that data not be produced in \"cell sizes\" \n11  that are smaller than five individuals.  Petitioners' proposed protective measures are insufficient \n12  to ensure that private information may not be traced to individuals.  Several Applicants have \n13  already protested that they would be individually identifiable, even with the safeguards \n14  Petitioners propose, in large part because the numbers of individuals comprising the groups \n15  Petitioners seek to study are small.  For example, among the Intervenors are African-American \n16  attorneys who were part of cohorts of fewer than ten in their graduating law school class.  While \n17  the combination of one or two variables may not necessarily identify an individual, the \n18  combination of several variables in the manner Petitioners seek creates a real risk that individual \n19  identities could be discovered.  FPCO, the agency charged with interpreting FERPA, has \n20  recognized that a student's identity can be easily traceable in the release of aggregated, \n21  anonymous, or de-identified data, even where the identity is revealed only through a combination \n22  of a series of requests.  There is also the risk others may mistakenly attribute one individual's \n23  data to another person, drawing incorrect conclusions about a person's academic credentials and \n24  test scores.  Intervenors are also concerned that such risks could have harmful effects on current \n25  law students who are members of underrepresented minorities.  This is precisely the harm that \n26  FERP A seeks to prevent. \n27  45.  The risk that individuals may be identifiable is ampliJied here because the \n28  proposed recipient of the data, Dr. Stephen Klein, has through his past work accessed additional \nII \nCase No.: CPF-08-508880 \nCOMPLAINT IN INTERVENTION \n\n1  data from the State Bar.  As Petitioners admit, Dr. Klein \"has had access to the bar examination \n2  records collected and maintained by the State Bar, and has conducted numerous studies and \n3  prepared numerous reports based on these records over the years.\"  (Petition, at ,Jl9.) \n4  Intervenors do not suggest that Petitioners have any intention of taking advantage of Dr. Klein's \n5  prior knowledge to improperly circumvent the privacy measures they propose.  However, it \n6  cannot be disputed that Dr. Klein has knowledge about Applicants from his prior work that \n7  others simply do not, and that this information could be used, even unintentionally, in \n8  combination with the information Petitioners now seek, to identify individuals. \n9  46.  Moreover, even if Petitioners' proposed methods were sufficient to \n10  maintain the individual Applicants' anonymity so that specific data could not be attributed to \n11  individuals, such a fact would not be sufficient to protect Applicants' privacy interests. \n12  Petitioners' proposal to limit \"cell sizes\" to five or more is insuf1icient to alleviate this concern \n13  because a cell of five individuals will still permit the exposure of average figures that could be \n14  unfairly and inaccurately generalized to very small groups of individuals.  For example, a \n15  statement such as \"80 percent of graduates of an elite private law school who are African \n16  American passed the Bar Exam with only a point to spare,\" would be permissible under the \n17  privacy measures Petitioners suggest.  As a result, it may be possible for Petitioners or the public \n18  to draw negative generalizations about a given group-regardless of size-as a whole, or about the \n19  majority of the members of the group, that may be inaccurate for a particular individual.  Further, \n20  the members of the public most likely to have background information that would enable them to \n21  deduce information about individual Applicants-such as former classmates and colleagues who \n22  are aware of the identities of members of these small cohorts-may, for professional reasons, be \n23  the people Intervenors most wish to prevent from learning this private information. \n24  47.  This is not a hypothetical concern.  In a September 26, 2007 Los Angeles \n25  Times op-ed, Sander asserted that 2005 graduates of \"one selective Califomia law school\" who \n26  were the beneficiaries of \"large preferences\" in admissions failed the Bar Exam at ten times the \n27  rate of their classmates.  Since in his work Sander has identified African-American students as \n28  the principal beneficiaries of \"preferences\" and since he teaches at what has been characterized \n12 \nCase No.: CPF-08-508880 \nCOMPLAINT IN INTERVENTION \n\n1  as a selective California law school, the logical inference drawn by a reasonable reader is that \n2  Sander referred to the 13 African-American students who graduated from UCLA that year. \n3  Whether or not individual members of this cohort were among the group who failed the bar on \n4  the first attempt, the aspersion has been cast on them as members of the group.  Petitioners' \n5  assertion that there is no risk of injury is belied by the way in which Sander has already made \n6  certain claimed assertions. \n7  48.  This risk is especially great when one considers that Petitioners seek not \n8  only pass-fail information but Bar Exam scores.  The State Bar represents to Applicants that the \n9  Bar Exam is a \"pass-fail\" test.  This is because the State Bar has determined that all successful \n10  applicants are equally qualified to practice law in California, and should not be treated \n11  differently simply because they received a higher or lower passing score.  As a result, Applicants \n12  prepare with the objective of achieving a passing score on the Bar Exam, not achieving a high \n13  score.  To measure Applicants' test performance on a different scale after the fact, and to \n14  represent to the public that these scores suggest something about Applicants' abilities that they \n15  do not, would subvert Applicants' fundamental assumptions in preparing for the Bar Exam.  ln \n16  fact, given the binary pass-fail structure, it would seem optimal for an Applicant to achieve the \n17  minimum passing score, because such a result would be maximally etTicient - devotion of the \n18  minimum time and effort necessary to achieve a passing score.  Such a post hoc disclosure of \n19  scores could also unfairly prejudice individuals who developed a course of study for the Bar \n20  Exam while balancing competing obligations, such as working or childcare. \n21  49.  Further, even if Petitioners could adequately demonstrate that the risk of \n22  disclosing information traceable to an individual is very low, such a showing does not \n23  necessarily entitle them to disclosure.  \"A privacy interest does not need to be violated before it \n24  can be acknowledged.\" (Planned Parenthood Golden Gate v. Superior Court (2000) 83 \n25  Cai.App.4th 347, 363 [refusing to disclose names and addresses of employees of Planned \n26  Parenthood].)  Even in a case where the potential for abuse is low, disclosure is not proper if the \n27  potential risks of disclosure are great. (See id. at 369.)  Here, there is great potential harm that \n28  could result from identification of Intervenors.  Intervenors have devoted considerable time and \n13 \nCase No.: CPF-08-508880 \nCOMPLAINT IN INTERVENTION \n\n1  effort to building their professional reputations, and the discovery of links between data and \n2  individuals, or erroneous linking of one individual to data pertaining to another individual, could \n3  unfairly threaten Intervenors' professional reputations and opportunities for career advancement. \n4  For example, if a client or employer were able to deduce that an individual passed the Bar \n5  Examination by a narrow margin (though the Bar Exam has been held out to its takers as merely \n6  a \"pass-fail\" test), or even that the individual was a member of a small cohort where the majority \n7  of members passed by a narrow margin, potential clients or employers may question that \n8  individual's professional competence, conclude that the individual is not capable of handling \n9  complex assignments, and award the work to others as a result.  Not only may these members of \n10  the public draw inappropriate conclusions, they may also do so in reliance on stale information, \n11  as Petitioners seek infonnation dating back to 1972. \n12  50.  Intervenors are aware that Petitioners have claimed that the State Bar \n13  cannot make public records into private records by promising Applicants that the information \n14  will be maintained as confidential.  However, as discussed above, merely because records are \n15  maintained by an arm of a court does not necessarily render those records public information. \n16  Also, in so arguing, Petitioners overlook that some of the information they seek-including the \n17  information on race-was provided voluntarily by the Applicants in reliance on these promises. \n18  51.  With respect to personnel records, which are comparable to the \n19  professional data sought here, \"California courts have generally concluded that the public \n20  interest in preserving confidential information outweighs the interest of a private litigant in \n21  obtaining the confidential information.\" (Harding Lawson Assocs·., 10 Cal.App.4th at 10.) \n22  Petitioners have failed to establish a vital interest sut1lcient to override the public interest. \n23 \nDISCLOSURE OF THE DATA SOUGHT BY PETITIONERS WOULD VIOLATE \nINTERVENORS' PRIVACY RIGHTS UNDER FERPA \n24 \n25  52.  Intervenors incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 51 above. \n26  53.  Disclosure of the information Petitioners seek would violate Intervenors' \n27  privacy rights under FERPA, 20 U .S.C. § 1232g. \n28 \n14 \nCase No.: CPF-08-508880 \nCOMPLAINT IN INTERVENTION \n\n1  54.  Under FERP A, educational institutions receiving federal funds are \n2  generally prohibited from releasing students' \"education records\" without express written \n3  consent.  (20 U.S.C. § l232g (b)(l).)  Personally identifiable information under FERPA is not \n4  limited to names, Social Security Numbers, birthdates, or other information that directly \n5  identifies an individual.  It also specifically includes information that, alone or when combined \n6  with other information, could be linked to a specific individual and that would allow a reasonable \n7  person within the school community to identify the individual with reasonable certainty.  (34 \n8  C.F.R. 99.3.)  Notably, \"[a] student's identity may ... be 'easily traceable' in the release of \n9  aggregated or statistical information derived from education records.\"  (Guidance Letter to \n10  Miami University re: Disclosure of Information Making Student's Identity Easily Traceable \n11  (FCPO, I Oct. 19, 2004), available at \n12  http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/tpco/ferpallibrary/unofiniami.html).  As set forth above, the \n13  information Petitioners seek would make Applicants' identities easily traceable, and thus it does \n14  not fall within the narrow exceptions to the rule of non-disclosure. \n15  55.  FERPA further provides that educational institutions may only disclose \n16  confidential education records to third parties, such as the State Bar, upon the condition that the \n17  third party may not pass on the disclosed information without the student's written consent.  (20 \n18  U.S.C. § l232g (b)(4)(B).)  In accordance with this provision, Intervenors' private education \n19  records were disclosed to the State Bar on the condition that the information would not be passed \n20  on without Intervenors' consent; thus, if the State Bar were to disclose the data to Petitioners \n21  without Intervenors' consent, the disclosure would violate FERPA. \n22  56.  If disclosure is ordered, Petitioners will suffer damages, as set forth above. \n23 \nINTERVENORS HAVE A CONTRACTUAL RIGHT TO KEEP THE REQUESTED \nINFORMATION PRIVATE \n24 \n25  57.  Intervenors incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 56 above. \n26  58.  As alleged above, Intervenors entered into written agreements with the \n27  State Bar that promised that the information Intervenors provided would be kept confidential and \n28 \n15 \nCase No.: CPF-08-508880 \nCOMPLAINT IN INTERVENTION \n\n1  not disclosed outside the State Bar. Intervenors provided the information sought in reliance on \n2  these promises of confidentiality. \n3  59.  On information and belief, Petitioners are aware that the State Bar \n4  promised that the information Intervenors provided would remain confidential. \n5  60.  As stated above, if disclosure of the information Petitioners seek is \n6  ordered, such an order would breach Intervenors' rights under the agreements to maintain the \n7  confidentiality of the information they provided. Petitioners' proposed protective measures do \n8  not prevent breach of Intervenors' contractual rights to maintain the confidentiality of the \n9  information provided. \n10  61.  If disclosure is ordered, Intervenors will suffer damage as set forth above. \n11  FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Declaratory Relief, Against Petitioners) \n12 \n13  62.  Intervenors incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 61  above. \n14  63.  An actual controversy has arisen and now exists relating to the rights and \n15  the duties of the parties in that Petitioners contend that they are entitled to obtain disclosure of \n16  Intervenors' sensitive, private information from the State Bar, and Intervenors deny this \n17  contention and object to Petitioners' efforts. \n18  64.  Intervenors desire a judicial determination of their rights and a declaration \n19  that Petitioners are not entitled to obtain disclosure ofthe information they seek via this action. \n20  65.  A judicial declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time so that \n21  Intervenors may be assured that their privacy rights will not be violated and that their contractual \n22  right to maintain the confidentiality of the information provided to the State Bar will be upheld. \n23  Absent a judicial determination, Intervenors' right to guard against disclosure of their sensitive, \n24  private information remains at risk. \n25  SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n(ln,junctive Relief, Against Petitioners) \n26 \n27  66.  Intervenors incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 65 above. \n28 \n16 \nCase No.: CPF-08-508880 \nCOMPLAINT IN INTERVENTION \n\n1  67.  If Petitioners' request for disclosure is granted, Intervenors will suffer \n2  irreparable injury in that sensitive, private information will be disclosed against their wishes and \n3  in violation of their right to privacy. \n4  68.  Intervenors have no adequate or speedy remedy at law as it will be \n5  impossible for Intervenors to determine the precise nature and amount of damages that will result \n6  from the violation of their privacy rights. \n7  WHEREFORE, Intervenors pray for judgment as follows: \n8  l.  For a declaration providing that Petitioners are not entitled to obtain \n9  disclosure from the State Bar of the information they seek concerning Intervenors; \n10  2.  For issuance of injunctive relief restraining and enjoining Petitioners from \n11  obtaining the information that they seek concerning Intervenors from the State Bar; \n12  3.  That the Petition, and each purported cause of action therein, be dismissed \n13  with prejudice; \n14  4.  That Petitioners' request for disclosure of information and other relief be \n15  denied; \n16  5.  That judgment be entered against Petitioners; \n17  and \n18  6.  For such other relief as the Court deems just. \n19 \n20  Dated: January 5, 2015  STEPTOE & JOHNSON LLP \n21 \nBy:_-'1-\"s'-'/W .-'-\"'ill\"'ia,m-\"-\"F~.-\"'A\"'b\"-r\"'am'-=-s ___  \n22 \nWILLIAM F.

The  Superior, Court, \nCity  and  County  of  San  Francisco,  No.  CPF—-08-508880,  Curtis  E.A \nMarnow,  J.,  denied  the  petition.  Researcher  and  organization  appealed, \nand  the  Court  of  Appeal  reversed  and  remanded.  The  Supreme  Court \ngranted  review,  superseding  the  opinion  of  the  Court  of  Appeal. \nHoldings:  The  Supreme  Court,  Canti-~Sakauye,  C.J.,  held  that: \n{|  State  Bar  rules  did  not  prevent disclosure: \né  public  interest  in  disclosure  was  sufficient  to  mandate  access  subject  to \nany  countervailing  interests;  and \n3  promises  of  confidentiality  did  not,  as  a  matter  of  law,  prohibit  disclosure. \nAffirmed  and remanded with  directions. \nsander  v.  State  Sar  of  California,  1726  Cal. Xptr.dd  S30,  superseded. \nOpinion \n304  “SOF  Plaintiffs Richard  sander,  Joe  Hicks,  and  the  (California)  First \nAmendment  Coalition  requested  that  the  State  Bar  of  California  (State  Bar) \nprovide  them  access  to  information  contained  in  its  bar  admissions \ndatabase,  including  applicants’  bar  exam  scores,  law  schools  attended, \ngrade  point  averages,  Law  School  Admissions  Test  scores,  and  race  or \nethnicity.  Plaintiff  Sander  sought  this  information  in  order  to  conduct \nresearch  on  racial  and  ethnic  disparities  in  bar  passage  rates  and  law \nschool  grades. \nThe  question  presented  is  whether  any  law  requires  disclosure  of  the  State \nBar's  admissions  database  on  bar  applicants.  We  conclude  that  under  the \ncommon  law  right  of  public  access,  there  is  a  sufficient  public  interest  in  the \ninformation  contained  in  the  admissions  database  such  that  the  State  Bar  is \nrequired  to  provide  access  to  it  if  the  information  can  be  provided  in  a  form \nthat  protects  the  privacy  of  applicants  and  if  no  countervailing  interest\noutweighs  the  public's  interest  in  disclosure.  Because  the  trial  court \nconcluded  that  there  was  no  legal  basis  for  requiring  disclosure  of  the \nadmissions  database,  the  parties  did  not  litigate,  and  the  trial  court  did  not \ndecide,  whether  and  how  the  admissions  database  might  be  redacted  or \notherwise  modified  to  protect  applicants’  privacy  and  whether  any \ncountervailing  interests  weigh  in  favor  of  nondisclosure.  Consequently,  the \nCourt  of  Appeal  will  be  directed  to  remand  the  case  to  the  trial  court. \n[.  FACTS \nThe  State  Bar  is  a  “public  corporation’  of  which  every  person  licensed  to \npractice  law in  the  state  is  a  member.  (Cal.  Const,  art.  VI,  §  9.)  The  State \nBar  “SOS  serves  “as  an  administrative  arm  of this  court  for  the  purpose  of \nassisiing  in  matters  of  admission  dee 23 o8ges   and  discipline  of attorneys.” \n(&me  r. y 73  iteo   tVcyey .

The  files  in  this  database  generally \ninclude  information  obtained  from  applicants  through  the  admissions \nprocess—inciuding  race  or  ethnicity,  law  schoo!  attended  and  year  of \ngraduation,  and  Law  Schoo!  Admissions  Test  (LSAT)  score—and \ninformation  regarding  the  applicant's  performance  on  the  bar  exam— \nincluding  whether  the  applicant  applied  for,  took,  passed  or  failed  the  bar \nexam,  and  the  applicant's  scores  on  the  bar  exam.  Some  of  the  files  also \ninclude  the  applicant's  law  school  grace  point  average,  but  the  bar  stopped \ncollecting  that  data  about  10  years  before  the  requesi  at  issue  here  was \nmade.  All  information  concerning  a  particular  applicant  is  identified  by a  file \nnumber  that  has  no  relationship  to  the  applicant's  name  or  personal \ninformation. \nMuch  of  the  information  contained  in  the  admissions  database  is  obtained \nthrough  the  application  process.  Every  applicant  signs  a  form  authorizing \nany  educational  or  other  institutions  to  release  to  the  State  Bar  all  records \nor  transcripts  related  to  the  applicant  that  the  State  Bar  seeks  in  connection \n  \nwith  the  application,  including  his  or  her  law  school  transcripts.  It  also \nauthorizes  the  State  Bar  to  transmit  the  applicant's  scores  on  the  bar  exam \nto  his  or  her  law  school.  Applicants  additionally  complete  an  “ethnic \nsurvey.”  The  survey  form  states  that  the  information  regarding  the \napplicant's  ethnicity  is  sought  “to  assist  in  the  continuing  evaluation  of  the \nexamination”  and  that  it  “will  be  treated  in  a  confidential  manner  and  will  be \nused  only  for  research  purposes.  It  will  not  be  retained  by  the  Committee \nas  part  of  your  application.” \nThe  State  Bar  regularly  publishes  the  names  of  those  who  pass  the  bar \nexam.  Using  the  admissions  database,  it  also  prepares  and  publishes  a \nnumber  of  reports  regarding  the  California  bar  exam.  After  each  bar  exam, \nit  prepares  a  statistical  analysis  of  the  bar  exam  that  reports  the  passage \nrates  for  various  categories  of  applicants,  including  type  of  law  school \nattended  (such  as  ABA  “388  accredited  or  unaccredited),  particular  law \nschool  attended,  first-time  takers  and  repeaters,  ethnic  group,  and  sex.  The \nstate  Bar  also  has  undertaken  and  reported  numerous  studies  on  particular \ntopics  related  to  the  bar  exam,  including  the  ciscrepancy  in  passage  rates \namong  racial/ethnic  groups  and  whether  bar  exam  scores  are  affected  by \nlaw  school  admissions  practices  related  to  race  and  ethnicity.1  These \nreports  are  *““288  available  to  the  public.  Except  through  its  reports,  the \nstate  Bar  has  not  made  the  information  in  tts  database  available  to  any \nother  entity  without  the  consent  of  applicants,  with  one  exception.  At  the \nrequest  of  the  Chief  Justice,  in  1990  and  1992,  it  provided  information \nidentifying  individual  applicants  and  their  bar  exam  scores  and  law  schools \nto  the  Law  School  Admission  Councils  for  a  national  study  on  the \nrelationship  between  law  school  performance  and  performance  on  the  bar \nexam. \nin  2006,  Professor  Richard  Sander,  of  the  University  of  California,  Los \nAngeles  School  of  Law,  proposed  to  collaborate  with  the  State  Bar  on \nresearch  regarding  racial  disparities  in  bar  passage  rates  and  law  schoo! \ngrades.  Sander's  hypothesis  is  that  these  asserted  disparities  might  be \naffected  by  racial  preferences  in  law  school  admissions  ““48¢3  that, \naccording  to  his  theory,  result  in  a  “mismatch”  between  the  minority \nstudent's  qualifications  and  the  level  of  instruction  at  the  law  school \nattended.  The  State  Bar's  Committee  of  Bar  Examiners  rejected  Sander's \nproposal  and  the  Board  of  Governors  confirmed  that  decision. \nsubsequently,  Sander  submitted  to  the  State  Bar  a  request  for  the  release \nof  records  in  the  database  regarding  applicants’  race,  ethnicity,  law  school, \nyear  of  law  school  graduation,  whether  the  applicant  was  a  transfer \nstudent,  bar  examination  scores,  whether  the  applicant  passed  the  exam,\nlaw  school  grace  paint  average  (GPA),  LSAT  score,  and  undergraduate \nGPA.  Sander  sought  the  information  with  any  identifying  information  about \nindividual  applicants  redacted.  The  California  First  Amendment  Coalition \nsubmitted  a  request  to  the  State  Bar  to  inspect  or  receive  copies  of  the \nsame  data  requested  by  Sander.  The  request  was  reviewed  by  the  State \nBar's  Committee  of  Bar  Examiners,  which  rejected  it,  citing,  among  other \nthings,  privacy  concerns. \nSander,  joined  by  the  First  Amendment  Coalition,  submitted  a  revised \nformal  request  for  public  information,  citing  articie  |  of  the  California \nConstitution,  the  common  law  right  of  access  to  public  records,  and  the \n“JO?  Caltfornia  Public  Records  Act  (Gov.Code,  §  6250  ef  seq.).  This \nrequest  sought  the  same  information,  but  proposed  additional  means  for \naddressing  the  State  Bar's  privacy  concerns.  It  proposed,  among  other \nthings,  that  certain  types  of  data  be  “clustered”  to  make  it  more  difficult  to \ncombine  the  information  in  the  catabase  with  information  available  from \npublic  sources  to  deduce  an  individual's  identity.  The  proposal  to  “cluster” \ndata  addressed  concerns  that  if  there  were  a  smail  number  of  individuals  in \na  particular  category  or  “cell”  it  would  arguably  be  easy  to  identify  them. \n“For  example,  suppose  that  a  law  school  had  only  one  Native  American \nstudent  in  its  2001  graduating  class.  Disclosing  an  individual-level  database \nthat  included  information  on  law  school,  year  of  graduation,  and  detailed \nrace  (including  ‘Native  American’  as  a  category)  would  make  it  possible  for \na  diligent  member  of  the  public  to  deduce  this  student's  identity,  and \nthereby  know  that  the  other  information  in  the  database  applied  to  him  or \nher.”  The  revised  request  would  reduce  the  likelihood  of  such  identification \nby  requiring  the  State  Bar  to  cluster  data  so  that  individuals  are  associated \nwith  a  category  of  law  school  rather  than  with  a  particular  law  school  and \nwith  a  range  of  years  of  graduation  rather  than  a  particular  year.  Race \nwould  be  reported  in  only  four  broad  categories—White,  Hispanic,  Black, \nand  other.  Furthermore,  if  “288  any  “cell”  contained  fewer  than  five \nindividuals,  data  would  be  further  clustered.  Sander  offered  to  pay  any \nreasonable  costs  incurred  by  the  State  Bar  in  complying  with  the  request. \nThe  request  was  denied. \nBelieving  that  this  court  might  have  exclusive  jurisdiction  in  the  matter, \nSander  and  the  First  Amendment  Coalition  (hereafter,  collectively, \nplaintiffs)  initially  filec  a  petition  for  writ  of  mandamus  with  this  court.  We \ndenied  the  petition  without  prejudice  to  refiling  in  an  appropriate  court. \nPlaintiffs  then  filed  a  petition  for  writ  of  mandate  in  the  superior  court, \nseeking  to  compel  the  State  Bar  to  provide  the  records. \nll.  PROCEEDINGS  BELOW\nBy  stipulation  of  the  parties,  proceedings  in  the  superior  court  were  divided \ninto  two  phases.  The  first  phase  addressed  whether  the  State  Bar  has  any \nlegal  duty  to  produce  the  requested  records.  The  second  phase  would \naddress  “whether  provision  of  the  requested  records  to  [plaintiffs]  would \nviolate  the  privacy  of  any  person  and  ...  whether  the  cost  or  burden  of \nmanipulation,  reproduction,  or  disclosure  of  the  requested  records  that  may \nbe  entailed  by  [plaintiffs']  request  provide  a  basis  for  denying  or  limiting \ndisclosure.”  After  trial  of  the  first  phase  based  on  declarations  and \nstipulated  facts,  the  trial  court  concluded  that  no  law  required  the  State  Bar \nto  disclose  the  records  in  the  admissions  database.  it  rejected  plaintiffs’ \nargument  that  cisclosure  was  required  under  the  state  common  law.  The \ntrial  court  concluded  that  the  common  law  right  of  access  to  judicial  branch \nrecords  was  limited  to  court  “30s  records of  adjucicatory  procesalngs,  that \nis,  to  “judicial  record[s]\"  as defined  in  Code  of  Cadi  Procedure,  section \n1904-—\"the  record  or  official  entry  of  the  sroceedings  | in  **s 4 a  court  of \njustice,  or  of  the  official  act  of  a  judicial  officer,  in  an  action  or  special \nproceeding.” \nThe  trial  court  also  rejected  plaintiffs’  argument  that  disclosure  was \nrequired  under  Proposition  59,  a  2004  ballot  measure  that  amended  the \nstate  Constitution  to  include  a right  of public  access  to  “the  writings  of \npublic  officials.”  (Gal.  Const.,  art.  1,  §  3,  subd.  (b)(1).)  It  concluded  that \nProposition  59  did  not create  any  new  substantive  rights,  but  simply \nconstitutionalized  existing  rights  of  access. \nin  light  of  these  conclusions,  the  trial  court  did  not  reach  the  question \nwhether  plaintiffs  were  seeking  the  production  of  a  “new’\"  record  that  was \nnot  required  under  public  access  laws.  The  trial  court  concluded  it  was \nunnecessary  to  resolve  that  issue,  and  in  any  event  the  record  was \ninsufficient.  It  recognized  that  “[i]n  the  context  of  digital  data,  it  does  not \nmake  much  sense  to  consider  simply  whether  a  document  demand \nrequires  the  creation  of  a  ‘new’  document  since  every  production  of \nelectronically  stored  data  literally  creates  a  ‘new’  document  on  screen,  on \npaper,  or  in  a  ‘new’  digital  file.”  To  determine  what  constitutes  the  creation \nof  a  new  file  would  require  consideration  of  the  complexity  of  the  tasks \nrequired  to  produce  the  data  requested,  a  matter  that  could  not  be \ndetermined  without  expert  ceclarations.  The  trial  court  denied  the  petition \nwithout  reaching  the  privacy  issues  that  had  been  reserved  for  the  second \nphase. \nThe  Court  of  Appeal  reversed,  holding  that  the  common  law  right  of  access \nto  public  records  created  a  presumption  that  the  records  in  the  State  Bar's \nadmissions  database  must  be  disclosed,  subject  to  a  determination\nconcerning  whether  the  public's  interest  in  disclosure  is  outweighed  by  the \nprivacy  interests  implicated  by  disclosure  or  other  countervailing  public \npolicy  concerns.  The  Court  of  Appeal  conciuded  that  the  common  law  right \n“sea?  of  public  access,  as  applicable  to  the  judicial  branch,  is  not  limited  to \ncourt  adjudicatory  records.  It  recognized  a  “parallel,  but  distinct”  right  of \naccess  based  on  the  First  Amendment  right  to open trials, which | is>   limited \nto  records  of adjudicatory  proceedings.  (See NBC  Subs! \nG fe \nSscePorte  d if a  ABEoNo  f EtaeLet  S é  &2 0m r :  fG a< 3} PAbAEtEhFYy    ARPOPPgE P  OF  OBet LY 2  4G YoQ o  12ra 0 GS \nyt  PPS,  BSO  Pad  S3Y (NBC  Subsidiary ).}  '  concluded, “however. \nthat  California  had  long  recognized  a  broader  common  law  right  of  access \nthat  applies  to  all  three  branches  of  government  and  is  not  limited  to \nadjudicatory  records.  Under  the  common  law,  the  Court  of  Appeal \nconcluded,  “  ‘where  there  is  no  contrary  statute  or  countervailing  public \npolicy, the right to  Inspec!  public records  mf ust  be  reely  allowed.” 7” \nAr \nTQS “(Cramer ). ) it held  that  because the ° “J2O0Sg  Bar| is  a  sublic  corporation \nand  the  records  sought  reiate  to  its  official  function  of  administering  the  bar \nexam,  a  matter  of  legitimate  public  interest,”  the  database  was \npresumptively  open  to  public  access,  “subject  to  balancing  against  the \nprivate  interests  implicated  by  disclosure.”  In  accordance  with  the  parties’ \nstipulation  that  the  case  would  be  tried  in  two  phases,  the  Court  of  Appeal \nreversed  and  remanded  for  further  proceedings  in  the  trial  court  to  consider \nand  weigh  any  countervailing  policy  considerations  against  the  presumption \nof  public  access.  The  Court  of  Appeal  declined  to  decide  whether  providing \nthe  requested  information  would  involve  the  creation  of  a  new  record \nbecause  the  trial  court  had  concluded  that  the  record  was  not  adequate  to \nresolve  that  question.  We  granted  review. \nHl.  DISCUSSION \nAs  explained  below,  no  statute  or  rule  resolves  the  question  before  us.  We \nconclude,  nevertheless,  that  under  common  law  principles  there  is  a  public \ninterest  in  access  to  the  State  Bar's  admissions  database  that  will  require \nthe  State  Bar  to  disclose  the  requested  information  if  it  can  be  applied  ina \nform  that  does  not  violate  the  privacy  of  applicants  and  if  other \nconsiderations  cdo  not  warrant  nondisclosure. \nA.  Public  Access  Laws \nThe  California  Public  Records  Act  (Gov.Code,  §  6250  ef  seq.;  CPRA)}, \ngoverns  requests  for  the  records  of  most public  agencies,  but  it  does  not \napply  to  the  judicial  branch.  The  definition  of  state  agencies  to  ““48S  which \niis  provisions  apply  excludes  “those  naw  provided  for  in...  Article  Vi  of \nthe  California  Constitution.”  (Gov Code,§  6252,  subd.  ).)  The  CPRA \n     \nrequires  those  agencies  provided  for  in  article  Vi  to  make  available  to  the \npublic  only  “an  itemized  statement of  the  total  expenditures  and \ndisbursement’  of  the  agency.  (Gov.Code,§  6261.) Articie  VI  of  the  state \nConstitution  establishes  the  courts ‘and  the  State  Bar,  as  well  as  the \nJudicial  Council,  the  Commission  on  Judicial  Appoiniments,  and  the \nCommission  on  Judicial  Performance.  (Cail. Const.,  art.  VI,  $8 1-9.)  Thus, \nthese  entities  are  exempt  from  most  provisions  of the CPRA. \n| \nA  variety  of  other  authorities,  however,  address  access  to  the  records  of \nJudicial  branch  entities,  including  the  courts  and  the  State  Bar. Anicis  |, \nsection  3,  subdivision  ()  of  the  state  Constitution, adopted  by  initiative  in \n2004  (Prop.  59),  addresses “the  right  of aa cces s  to  information  concerning \nthe  conduct  of  the  people's  business.”  (Cal.  Const,  art.  1,  &  3,  subd.  (b)(1).) \nMore  specifically,  access  to  court  records is  governed  by  long-standing \ncommon  law  principles  as  well  as  constitutional  panei  derived  from  the \nFirst  Amendment  right  of  public  access  to  triais.  (See  “SIG  “S58  NEC \n       \n2  ETP  EO \nSal  Rptr  + (Copley PressS ). )  Recently  adopted  rules  of  court  govern \naccess  to  the  administrative  records  of  the  courts,  the  Judicial  Council,  and \nthe  Administrative  Office  of  the  Courts.  (See Cal. Rules of  Court,  rule \nfon \nTO  S00(oHS).)  The  state  Bar is  subject  to  the  State  Bar  Act  (Bt is.  &  Prof. \nGode,  8  6000  ef seq.),  which  contains  numerous  statutes  that  make  various \nof  its  activities  and records  public  and  others  confidential.  (See Bus. & \nFrof.Code,  § 6000  et seq.}s  It is  also  subject  to  rules  adopted  by itt s \ngoverning  body,  which \\ was,  at  the  time  that  plaintiffs  made  their  request, \nthe  Board  of  Governors  and  is  now  called  the  Board  of  Trustees  (hereafter, \nthe  Board).4  The  Board  was  authorized  to,  among  other  things,  adopt  rules \n“necessary  or  expedient”  for  the Carrying  out  of  the  State  Bar's \nresponsibilities.  (Sus.  &  Prof.Code,  § 6025.) \n3.  Statutes  and  Rules  Applicable  to  the  state  Bar \nAS  a  preliminary  matter,  we  conclude  that  the  statutes  and  rules  specifically \napplicable  to  the  State  Bar  neither  demand  nor  prohibit  the  access  to  the \nstate  Bar's  admissions  database  that  plaintiffs  seek,  although  they  do \nconfirm  that  members  and  applicants  have  some  expectation  of  privacy  in \ntheir  records.  Under  the  State  Bar  Act,  the  State  Bar  must  make  available \nto  the publ  in  addition  to  the  financial  information  specified  in \nGovernment  Code  section 6261,  part  of  the  CPRA,  “the  classification  and \ntotal  annual  compensation  paid  to  each  of  its  employees  by  name,” as  well \nas  its  policies  regarding  employee  benefits  and  compensation.  (Sus. &\nMrohCade,  § 6001.4.)  The  meetings  of  the  Board are  open  to  the  public, \nwith  specified  exceptions.  (Sus.  &  Prof.Cace,  SS$ 020.5.)  The  bar must \nmaintain  official  membership  records.  (Sus.  &  Prof $. Code s,  §  6002.7,  subd. \n(a}.)  An  unsuccessful  applicant  has  the  right  to  inspect  his  or  ner \nexamination  papers,  and  the  grading  of  those  papers.  (Sus.  & Prot.C2 ode,  n\no\n60605,  subd.  (a}.) \nBar  members  have  the  right,  however,  to  limit  the  disclosure  of  their \ninformation  | not  reasonably  related  to  regulatory  purposes.”  (Sus. & \nProf.Code,  §  6001.)  The “investigations  or  proceedings  conducted  by  the \nState Bar concerning  the  moral  character  of  an  applicant  shail  be \nconfidential  unless  the  “S77  applicant,  in  writing,  waives  the  confidentiality.” \n**g96  (Bus.  & Prof.  Code, 8  6060.2.) Any “demographic  data  collected”  by \nthe  State  Bar  about  its  members “shall  be  used  only  for  general  purposes \nand  shail  not  be  identified  to  any  individual  member  or  his  or  her  State  Bar \nrecord.”  (Sus.  &  Prof.Code,  §  6009.5.) \nRules  adopted by  the  Board  require  public  access  to  a  number  of  State  Bar \nrecords.  For  example,  each  member's  name,  bar  number,  current  address, \ntelephone  number,  e-mail  address,  date  of  admission **\"288  in  California \nand  other  jurisdictions,  membership  status,  and  date  of  any  discipline \nimposed,  is  available  to  the  public.  (Rules  of  State  Bar,  tit.  2,  rule  2.2.)  The \nstate  Bar's  Committee  of  Bar  Examiners  is  authorized  to  “publish  statistics \nfor  each  examination  in  accordance  with  its  policies.”  (Rules  of  State  Bar, \ntit.  4,  rule  4.7.) \n2 \nOnly  one  State  Bar  rule  is  arguably  relevant  here.  The  State  Bar  suggests \nthat  rule  4.4  prohibits  public  disclosure  of  its  admissions  database.  Rule  4.4 \nmakes  the  records  of  applicants  for  bar  membership  confidential  “unless \nrequired  to  be  disclosed  by  law  ...  or  authorized  by  the  applicant  in  writing \nfor  release  to  others.”  (Rules  of  State  Bar,  tit.  4,  rule  4.4,  fn.  omitted \n(hereafter  rule  4.4).) \nThis  rule  does  not  require  that  plaintiffs’  request  for  access  to  the  database \nbe  denied.  Rule  4.4  does  not  define  “applicant  records.”  As  noted  above, \nthe  admissions  database  at  issue  in  this  case  is  an  electronic  record  of \ninformation  about  each  applicant's  performance  on  the  bar  exam  and  cata \nabout  each  applicant  obtained  by  the  State  Bar  in  the  application  process. \nAlthough  the  admissions  database  reasonably  comes  within  the  term \n“applicant  records,”  plaintiffs  have  requested  the  information  in  a  “de- \nidentified”  form,  that  is,  without  applicant  names  or  other  information  that \ncould  be  used  to  identify  an  individual.  Assuming,  for  purposes  of \ndiscussion,  that  the  records  in  the  admissions  database  may  effectively  be \ndeidentified,  such  ceidentified  records  do  not  constitute  “applicant  records” \nto  which  public  access  would  be  prohibited  under  the  rule.  The  apparent \npurposes  of  rule  4.4  are  to  protect  applicants’  privacy  interests  and  the \nstate  Bar's  ability  to  collect  the  information  it  needs  to  evaluate  applicants, \nwhich  it  does  under  a  promise  of  confidentiality.  lf  the  applicant  cannot  be \nidentified,  disclosure  of  information  does  not  impair  his  or  her  privacy \ninterests  and  the  prospect  of  such  disclosure  is enunely  to  affect  the  bar's \nability: to  obtain  the  information  it  needs.  (Cf. Osborn  v.  Bd.  of Regents \n \na\n(2002)  254 Wi AS  a Sf>Nae   mSt eal   27A8 6,  Ad “fs Ps ORR3 FE  LuWYAAO¥?YE    wa.“ Cl 3  a tI ANiQ O ,  Aw} oaSeE: @    F3 nene  74 4  [under  federal  Family \nEducational  Rights  and  Privacy  Act, “once  personally  identifiable \ninformation  is  deleted,  by  definition,  a  record  is  no  longer  an  education \nrecord  since  it  is  no  longer  directly  related  to  a  student’].)  Indeed,  as  noted \nearlier,  the  State  Bar  itself  regularly  “s7é  publishes  statistical  reports  on  bar \nexam  passage  rates,  broken  down  by  race,  gender,  and  law  schoo! \nattended,  in  a  form  that  does  not  identify  individual  applicants.  Thus,  in \npractice,  the  State  Bar  does  not  interpret  its  rule  as  requiring  that \ndeidentified  information  from  applicant  records  be  kept  completely \nconfidential.  The  most  reasonable  construction  of  rule  4.4  is  that  it \npreserves  the  conficentiality  of  applicant  records  that  connect  particular \ninformation  about  an  applicant  with  the  applicant's  name  or  other  identifying \ninformation. \nThis  construction  of  rule  4.4  is  consistent  with  the  approach  used  in  laws \ngoverning  information  similar  to  that  sought  here—inciuding  LSAT  scores \nand  academic  records—in  other  contexts.  A  testing  agency  that \nadministers  tests  used  for  purposes  of  admission  to  postsecondary \neducational  institutions—including  the  Law  Schoo!  Admission  Council, \nwhich  administers  the  LSAT—-may  not  disclose  an  individual's fest  score \nwithout  the  individual's  authorization.  (&c.Cade,  §  $9701,  subd.  (4).)  Such \nan  agency,  however, “may  release  test  ss cores  and  other  information  ina \nform  which  does  not  identify  any  individual  test  subject  for  purposes  of \nresearch,  studies,  and  reports  primarily  concerning  the  test  itself.” \n(ed.Cocde,  §  88767,  subd.  (5).) \n*s 260 Similarly,  the  records  of  elementary  and  secondary  schoo!  pupils  are \ncoo nfidential  and  may  be  released  only in  limited  circumstances  (Ed.Code,  § \n49076),  but  a  school  district is  not  prohibited  “from  providing,  in  its \ndiscretion,  statistical  data  from  which  no  pupil  ““¢9?  may  be  identified  to \nany  public  agency  or  entity  or  private  nonprofit  college,  university,  or \neducational  research  and  development  organization  when  such  actions \nwould  be  in  the  best  educational  interests  of  pupils.”  (ed.Code,  §  48074.) \nUnder  the  federal  law  applicable  to  educational  institutions  receiving  federal \nfunds  (20  U.S.C.~—,   §  1232q),  student  records  generally  may  not  be  cisclosec \nwithout  consent,  but  disclosure  without  consent is  permitted “after  the \nremoval  of  all  personally  identifiable  information  provided  that  the \neducational  agency  or  institution  or  other  party  has  made  a  reasonable \ndetermination  that  a  student's  identity  is  not  personally  identifiable,  whether \nthrough  single  or  multiple  releases,  and  taking  into  account  other \nreasonably  available  information.”  (24  C.F.R.§  99. 37(b}(1)  (2073).) \nif  there  were  some  doubt  about  whether  rule  4.4  prohibits  public  access  to \nthe  State  Bar's  database  even vin  a  deidentitied  form,  we  nevertheless  must \nreipret the  rule  |  in  ont  of  article  1,  section  3,s ubdivision  ())  of  the \nCalifornia  Constiutio  .  That section  provides:  “(1})  The  people  have  the \nright  of. access  to information  concerning  the  conduct  of  the  people's \nbusiness,  and  therefore  ...  the  writings  of  public  officials  and  agencies  shall \nbe  open  to  public  scrutiny.  [{]  (2)  A  statute,  court  rule,  or  other  authority  ... \nshail  be “373  broadly  construed  if  it  furthers  the  people's  right  of  access, \nand  narrowly  construed  if  it  limits  the  right  of  access.”  (/bid.)  Although  the \nstate  Bar  contends  that  section  3,  subdivision  (b)(1)  does  not  create  any \nsubstantive  rights  of  access  and  merely  “constitutionalizes”  existing  public \naccess  rights,  it  does  not  contend  that  the  rule  of  interpretation  contained  in \nsubdivision  (b)(2)  is  inapplicable  to  its  rules.  Consequently,  we  are  required \nto  interpret  rule  4.4  narrowly.  Narrowly  interpreted,  rule  4.4  does  not  bar \nrelease  of  the  deidentified  information  that  plaintiffs  seek. \nC.  The  Common  Law  Right  of  Access  to  Public  Records \nAs  demonstrated  above,  the  statutes  and  rules  applicable  to  the  State  Bar \ndo  not  bar  plaintiffs’  request,  but  neither  do  they  specifically  require \ndisclosure.  We  turn  to  the  question  of  whether  the  common  law,  including \ncases  interpreting  contemporary  statutory  language,  recognizes  a  right  of \npublic  access  to  the  records  requested  by  plaintiffs.  As  discussed  above, \nthe  Court  of  Appeal  concluded  that  the  common  law  establishes  a \npresumptive  right  of  access  to  the  State  Bar's  admissions  database \n“subject  to  balancing  against  the  private  interests  implicated  by  disclosure’ \nbecause  the  “Bar  is  a  public  corporation  and  the  records  sought  relate  to  its \nofficial  function  of  administering  the  bar  exam,  a  matter  of  legitimate  public \ninterest.”  The  State  Bar  does  not  dispute  that  a  common  law  right  of  access \nto  publ  records  exists  or  that  this right  applies  to  the  state  Bar.  (See \nCCL”o~ aht:  lrLoRnpi Iccyl  e APAuNab g.e&  . OMCAowfoA e. ,  Eg  vW—.W  .

However,  the  State  Bar  argues  that  the  common  law  applicable \nto  all  public  entities—upon  which  the  Court  of  Appeal  relied—applies  only \nto  records  that  officially  memorialize  or  record  government  action.  The\nstate  Bar  contends  that  the  Court  of  Appeal  erred  in  concluding  that  under \ncommon  law  principles,  there  is  a  presumption  of  public  access  to  any \nrecord  maintained  by  a  public  entity  that  relates  in  some  way  to  the  public's \nDUSINESS. \nwseeO7 The  State  Bar  interprets  the  common  law  right  of  public  access  too \nnarrowly.  Historically  “  ‘alt  common  law  every  person  was  entitled  to  the \ninspection,  either  personally  or  by  his  agent,  of  public  records,  including \nlegislative,  executive,  and  judicial  records,  provided  he  had  an  interest \ntherein  such  as  to  enable  him  to  maintain  or  defend  an  action  for  which  the \ndocuments  or  records  sougnt  could  furnish  evidence  or  necessary \ninformation.

The  public  policy  in  favor  of  access  to  matters  of  public \ninterest  informed  our  interpretation  of  this  statute.  These  plans  represented \nsteps  in  the  completion  of  a  large  public  project  that  was  being  undertaken \nby  public  employees  at  public  expense.  “As  such  they  are  matters  which \naffect  the  public,  and  in  which  the  public  has  an  interest,  if  that  interest  is \nonly  to  see  that  the  city  engineer  is Fane  steps toward the  completion  of \n[the  project].”  (Cofdwell,  supra,  at  op.  520-527,  202  P.  879.) \nA  number  of  Attorney  General  opinions  addressing the  right  of  public \naccess  under  ““€88  these  former  statutes  expressed  the  view  that \nparticular  documents  in  possession  of  government  agencies  were  not \nsubject  to  public  disclosure  because  they  were  neither  the  “written  acts  or \nrecords  of  the  acts’  of  public  officials  or  bodies  nor  of  sufficient  public \ninterest  too  aualy  as  “  other  matters”  to  which  access  was  granted  under \nor  similarly:w orded  predecessor  statutes.

Records  maintained  by  a \npublic  entity  were  subject  to  a  qualified  right  of  public  access  if  they  were \nrecords  that  constituted  the  “written  acts  or  records  of  acts”  of  the  public \nentity,  or  if  they  constituted  “other  matters”  of  sufficient  public  interest  to \njustify  requiring  public  access,  taking  into  account  the  facts  of  the  particular \ncase,  unless  other  interests,  including  a  need  for  confidentiality,  weighed  in \nfavor  of  nondisclosure. \nThe  State  Bar  cites Afushef Vv,  Deparment  of Pub.  Service  (1977)  35 \nPOR,  6S. 3 (Mushet  as  support  for  ts$ s  argument  that \nCoaall . AY ON.  B3wt0   B34,  TPerPeO   hPeR , \n \nonly  records  that  officially  memorialize  or  record  government  actions \nconstitute  public  records  under  California  common  law.  As  we  explain, \nhowever,  we  find  Mushet  consistent  with  the  authorities  discussed  above, \nwhich  recognize  a  qualified  right  of  public  access  to  records  of  government \nagencies  that  are  of  public  interest,  subject  to  countervailing  public  policy \nconsiderations. \nTo  be  sure,  Adushel, supra,  35  Cal.Anp.  af  page  634,  170 PF.  653 did \nrecognize  that ' “public  records,”  as  defined  in  the statutes  of  the ‘time, \nincluded  the  official  records  of  government  action.  Mushet,  however,  did \nnot  limit  the  right  of  access  to  documents  that  came  within  this  definition, \nbut  applied  a  more expansive  common  law  rule  to  require  disclosure.  (/d.  at \npo. 636-039,  170  RP.  653.)  Mushet  applied  the  public  access  right  to  books, \naccounts,  and  other  records  possessed  by  the  city  explaining  items  of \nexpenditure,  and  anticipated  expenditures,  related  to  a  project  to  expand \nthe  infrastructure  of  power  generation  in  Los  Angeles.  (ic.  at  p.  634,  170  PR. \n653.)  These  documents  were  not  technically “public  records’  within the \nmeaning  ““S80  of  applicable  statutes  because,  under  the  law in  effect  at  the \ntime,  the  city  was  acting  as  a  private “S37?  utility  corporation  in  conducting \nthose  activities  and  therefore  the  records  at  issue  were  not  “  official.” \nNevertheless,  the  records  reflected  the  use  of  public  funds.  The  court \nconcluded  that  voters  and  taxpayers  had  “a  great  interest  in  the  proper \nmanagement  of  the  business  and  matters  pertaining  to  their  county,  and \ntherefore  are  entitled  to  know  whether  the  public  officials  wnom  they  have \nselected  to  represent  them  have  properly  used,  disbursed,  and  accounted \nfor  the  public  funds  which  under  the  law  have  been  confided  to  their \ncustody  and  administration.”  (ia.  at  p. oS\",  770  BR,  653.)  The  court \nexplained  that “[t]he  rules  of  the  cc  ommon  law  will  be  applied  to  those  cases \nwhich  come  within  their  reason  and  equity,  even  when  such  cases  seem  to \nbe  outside  the strict  letter  of  such  rules  as  they  are  ordinarily  stated...”  (fa. \n264 The  state  of the  law  of  public  access  to  the  records  of  public  entities \nprior  to  the  1968  acoption  of  the  CPRA  was  succinctly  summarized  in  an \nopinion  of  the  California  Attorney  General  as  follows:  “The  phrase  ‘public \nrecords’  in  Political  Code  section  1032  was  limited  to  those  documents \nmeeting  the  definitions  of  ‘public  writings’  expressed  in  Code  of  Civil \nProcedure  sections  1888  and  7894.  To  balance  this  restricted  definition, \nthe  law  also  permitted  public  inspection  of  certain  ‘other  matters’  in  the \noffice  of  a  public  officer  if  they  were  matters  which  were  ‘public’  and  in \nwhich  the  whole  public  might  have  an  interest.

Common  Law  Principles  as  Applied  to  Court  Records \nThe  State  Bar  contends  that  because  it  is  a  judicial  branch  entity,  and \nbecause  it  acts  as  an  “acministrative  arm’  of  this  court  in  connection  with \nadmissions,  these  general  common  law  principles  should  not  govern  tt. \n“378  Rather,  it  arques,  it  should  be  subject  to  only  the  common  law  rules \nthat  are  applicable  specifically  to  court  records.  Public  access  to  court \nrecords,  the  State  Bar  contends,  is  limited  to  those  that  ‘ accurately  and \nofficially  reflect| !  the  work  of  the court.’ (ee opley  Press,  supra,  & \nCalApo.dth atop.  113,  % Cal Rotred 844  (defining  a  judicial  record  as  one \nthat  accurately  and  officially  reflects  the  work  of  the  court,  such  as  its \norders  and  judgments,  its  scheduling  and  administration  of  cases,  its \nassignment of  judicial  officers  and  administrators”|.)  Thus,  it  contends, \npublic  access  to  its  records  under  the  common  law  should  be  limited  to \nthose  that  accurately  and  officially  reflect  the  work  of  the  State  Bar.  As \nexplained  below,  the  general  principles  regarding  public  access  to  the \nrecords  of  public  entities  established  in  the  statutes  and  case  law \ndiscussed  above  continue  to  apply  in  the  context  of  court  records. \nConsequently,  the  right  is  not  limited  in  the  manner  proposed  by  the  State \nBar. \n3 \nWhen  the  CPRA  was adopted  In  1968,  Code  of  Givi  Mrocedure sections \n1888  and  1892  and  Government  Code  section  122) / discussed  above, \nwhich  had  codified  the  general  right  of  access  to  public  records,  were \nrepealed.  *“S07  (Stats.  1968,  ch.  1473,  §§  24~—25,  38,  p.  2945.) \nNevertheless,  both  statute  anc  case  law  continued  to  recognize  this  right  of \naccess.  The  Legislature  declared  that  “access  to  information  concerning \nthe  conduct  of  the  people's  business  IS ¢a   fundamental  and  necessary  right \nof  every  citizen  of  this  state.”  (soy.  Code,§  6250,  enacted  by  Stats.  1968, \nch.  1473,  §  39,  p.  2945.)  The  courts  were  made  exempt  from  most \nprovisions  of  the  CPRA,  but  the  Legislature  explicitly  preserved  existing  law \nregarding  “the  status of  judicial  records  as  it  existed  immediately  prior  to \nthe  effective  date  of  this  section.”  (Gov.  Cade,  §  6260,  enacted  by  “““s88 \nstats.  1968,  ch.  1473,  §  39,  p.  2945.)  The  common  law  right  of  access \ncontinued  to  be  applied  and  fo  develop  in  cases  addressing  court  records, \nwhich  recognized  that  “[t]o  prevent  secrecy  in  public  affairs  public  policy \nmakes  public  records  and  documents  available  for  ae  spoon  by \nnewsmen  and  members  of  the  general  public  alike.”  (Estate of  Nears \nCio’ mR7 )  OF Caoxy lApp.od~   Ifo% ?,  C(F8O2S,   14 36  Cal Rotr.

It  identified  two  categories  of  records  typically \nused  in  the  courts.  The  first  included  “documentation  which  accurately  and \nofficially  reflects  the  work  of  the  court,  such  as  its  orders  and  judgmenis,  its \nscheduling  and  administration  of  cases,  its  assignment of judicial  officers \nand  administrators[,]  ...  the  official  court  minutes,  all  its  written  orders  and \ndispositions,  the  official  reports  of  oral  proceedings,  ...  the  master  calendar \n[,]. ..  fand]  the  various  documents  filed  in  or  received  by  the  court .. and  the \nevidence  admitted  in  court  proceedings.  (Ud.  ato.  1138,  7  Cal. Xotr2d  847.) \nThese  documents  are “  ‘judicial  record[s]}’  ”  that  ‘represent  and  reflect t  the \nofficial  work  of  the  court,  in  “878  which  the  public  and  press  have  a \njustifiable  interest.”  (/bid.)  They  are  presumptively  accessible  to  the  public.? \nThe  second  category  of  records  identified  in  Copley  Press  includes  informal \nanc  preliminary  writings  used  by  the  courts,  such  as  rough cratts,  informal \nnotes,  memoranda, and  other  preliminary  writings.  (Copley  Press, supra,  & \nCalAgp.4th  atop.  114,  7  Cal. Rotr2d  847.)  Although  such  writings  are  used \nby  judges i in  the. course of judicial  work,  mey  a@ re  not  subject  to  the  a  of \npublic  access.  (/bid.;  see Nfe&teC   S8u : bsiddiiaafa rryy,  ,  suprara,,   2“yf0 y   ¢Go ta l.dththy   aatr x rp .  a t1l  214,3   =i nry.  \narye  ey  Gal Rptrédmy   7¥8,  9N8O0W   Pad3   3\" 6 7 7.)  The  rer eason  is  that  public  access  to \nSS  RS  A  rt \nsuch  documents  is  not  generally  i in  the  public  interest  because  they  are \n“tentative,  often  wrong,  sometimes misleading  .. - they  do  not  speak  for the \ncourt  and  do  not  constitute  court  action.”  (Capley  Press,  supra,  al p.  114 \nCal. Rpotrdd  841.)  Furthermore,  access  to  such ‘preliminary  writings  ' ‘would \nseverely  hamper  the  users  of  the  materials”  because  their  purpose  is  to \n“extract  raw  and  immature  thoughts  from  the  brain  to  paper,  so  they  can  be \nrefined  and  corrected.”  (/bid.)  Knowing  that  such  materials  could  be \nexposed  to  the  public  eye  would  inhibit  their  creation. \nCopley  Press  recognized,  however,  that  not  every  document  used  and \nmaintained  by  courts  clearly  falls  into  one  of  these  two  categories.  It \nidentified  a  third  category  of  records  that\" are  on  the  margin’ of  wes dO \nthese  two categories.  ( “802 Copley  Press,  supra,  6  Cal.App.4th  ato.  4 \nworry 15,\n*  Gal Rotred  841.)  in  Copley Press,  members  of  the  press ‘sought  access \nto  the minute  books  of  the  clerks  serving  six  superior  court  judges,  in  order \nto  investigate  whether  gifts  judges  reported  from  certain  attorneys  may \nhave  influenced  judicial  conduct.  The  minute  books  are  informal  notes  kept \n  \nby  the  clerks  as  a  precursor  to  the  creation  of  the  formal  minutes  of  the \ncourt.  The  appellate  court  concluded  that  the  clerk's  rough  minutes  fall  into \nthis  marginal  category.  They  are  not  official  records  of  the  court  and  do  not \nconstitute  court  action,  but  “[o]n  the  other  hand,  they  do  not  partake  of  the \ndiscretionary  and  incomplete  content  that  characterizes  the  judge's  bench \nnotes  or  the  first  drafts  of  various  court  documents.”  Ubid.)  The  court \nconcluded  that  the  clerk's  rough  minutes  should  be  disclosed  to  the  public. \nThe  court  noted  that  they  are  kept  regularly  by  all  clerks,  they  reflect \nministerial  actions  by  the  clerk,  and  “  the  clerk's  minute  book  presumptively \n“320  contains  only  accurate,  descriptive  and  non-discretionary  information.” \n(ibid.)  Significantly,  the  court  pointed  out  that  the  minute  book “is  the  one \nrepository  of  easy  access  which  provides  a  continuous  chronology  of  each \ncourt's  daily  activities.”  Thus,  in  deciding  whether  documents  that  do  not \nclearly  fall  into  the  category  of  public  court  records  are  subject  to  a  right  of \naccess,  Copley  Press  focused  on  the  usefulness  of  the  records  and \nthereby  on  the  public's  interest in  access  to  those  records. \n&rt  SPtn OFg hSe  Set  WOoyM s2 e   CrP NL oTPBP,.  e PF  AoeAwR NE eo tef   CMofo aFeL  OLmHe MLnE.a  PbIteP Y o   OSaF]f   £  wSee s O  PSP Saarrl aayy  me oyI SCoOry   t5f f ai4 gcs  AV4AL)   AAPRmaTal   do5   ¢Np ew»c aSi y   APOAA DED oOh  ow>t“ sS had  pol  256sa,  \nai.Rotr.

First,  Pantos  held \n&  Zs \na te \nourt's master  jury  list  of  potential  jurors  qualified  fors service  was  a \nrecord  that  must  be  disclosed  to  the  public.  Ud.  at op. 262~-263,  198 \nLLRRRo  te  489.)  The  master  list  constituted  an  official  list  nrepared  by  the \njury  commissioner  that  had  historically  been  treated  as  a  public  document, \nand  the  Court  of ‘*ppeal  found  no  compelling  reason  for  nondisclosure.  (Ud \nato.  260,  198  Cal. Rotr.  489.)  Second,  Pantos  heid  that  questionnaires \nused  by  the  jury  commissioner  to  determine  whether  citizens  were  qualified \nfor  jury  service  cid  not  have  to  be  disclosed.  Although  the  questionnaires \nwere  used  and  maintained  by  the  court,  they  had  not  historically  been \ndisclosed  to  the  public.  The  plaintiff  in  Pantos  argued  that  access  to  the \nquestionnaires  would  enhance  the  selection  of  a fair  jury,  but  the  court \nconcluded  that  voir  dire  questioning  was  sufficient  for  that  purpose.  (/a.at  \npo. 263—265,  198  Cal. Xotr.  489.)  Furthermore,  the  questionnaire  stated \nthat  the  prospective  juror  is  compelled  by  law  to  provide  the  information \nand  that  the  questionnaire  is  confidential  and  will  not  be  made  public.  (id \n hoA etivY \n6ry.  264,  198  Cal. Rptr.  489.) “To  disclose  this  information  under  these \nconditions  may  negatively  impact  on  the  prospective  juror's  willingness  to \nserve  and  thus  interfere  with  efficient  court  administration....  Public  interest \nin  withholding  such  questionnaires  outweighs  the  public's  interest  in \ndisclosure.”  (ol  af  op.  264—265,  198  Cal. Rptr. 489.) \nThe  approach  to  court records  set  forth  in  Copley  Press  and  applied  in \nPantos  is  consistent  with  the  general  statutory  and  common  law  principles \n  \nregarding  the  right  of  public  access  as  applied  in  California  before  the \nadoption  of  the  CPRA.  As  discussed  above,  the  right  applied  to  the  “‘ \n“written  acts  or  records  of  the  acts’  '”  of  government  officials  and  entities \nand  also  to  “other  matters”  that  were  of  sufficient  interest  to  the  pups to \nwarrant  disclosure,  subject  to  countervailing  public  interests.

The  court  in  Washington  Legal \nFoundation  applied  the  common  law  right  of  access  to  a  judicial  branch \nentity  other  than  a  couri—an  advisory  committee  to° 008  the  United States \nSentencing  Commission.  The  petitioner in  Yashington  Legal  Foundation, \nsupra,  89 F.3d  at  page  89S  sought  °  ‘internal  documents  and  memoranda’ \nrelied  upon  by  an  advisory  group  in  formulating  its  final  public \nrecommendations  to  the  United  States  Sentencing  Commission.  The \nfederal  appeilate  court  declared  that  under  feceral  common  law,  a  public \nrecord  was  “a  government  document  created  and  kept  for  the  purpose  of \nmemorializing  or  recording  an  official  action,  decision,  statement,  or  other \nmatter  of  legal  significance,  broadly  conceived.”  Ud.  at p.  905.)  It  concluded \nthat  the  public  has  a  presumptive  right  of  access  to  such  records,  subject  to \na  balancing  of  public  and  private  interests.  (/bid.)  The  court  viewed  this \ndefinition  as  allowing  adequate  public  oversight  of  government  agencies \nwhile  avoiding  “the  necessity  for  judicial  application  of  the  second-step \nbalancing  test  to  documents  that  are  preliminary,  advisory,  or...  do  not \neventuate  in  any  official  action  or  decision  being  taken.”  (/bid.) \nThe  court  clarified  that  this  definition  would  include  records  of  governmenial \nexpenditures,  records  of  real  estate  transactions,  and  a  list  of  tax \nabatements  passed  by  a  local  government.  (Washingfon  Legal Foundation, \nsupra,  89  F Sd ato.  905.)  In  contrast,  this definition  ‘would  hot  encompass \nthe oreliminary  materials  upon  which  an  official  relied  in  making  a  decision \nor  other  writings  incidental  to  the  decision  iiself—for  example,  the  report  of \na  blood  test  provided  in  support  of  an  application  for  a  marriage  license,  the \njob  application  of  a  would-be  government  employee,  a  government \n  \nauditor's  preliminary  notes  used  in  the  preparation  of  an  official  report,  or  a \ncover  memorandum  circulated  with  a  copy  of  an  official  report  or  study.”  (fa. \nat  oo.  805-~906.)  The  court  held  that  the  advisory  committee  records  sought \nby the  netitioner  were  not  public  records  because  they  were  either“   ‘pre- \ndecisional’  ”  or  incidental  to  the official  actions,  decisions,  and  statements \nof  that  commission.  (ic.  at  p. 906.)  Consequently,  there  was  no \npresumptive  right  of  public  access  and  the  court  was  not  required  to \nbalance  competing  interests. \nWashington  Legal  Foundation's  categories  of  records  that  must  be \ndisclosed  and  those  that  need  not  be  disclosed  are  essentially  the  same \ntwo  categories  recognized  in  Copley  Press,  and  its  holding  is  consistent \nwith  Copley  Press  because  the  internal  documents  and  memoranda  of  an \nadvisory  committee  would  fall  into  the  category  of  records  that  are  not \ndisclosable  under  Copley  Press.  Unlike  Copley  Press,  however,  the  court  in \nWashington  Legal  Foundation  did  not  consider  whether  recorcs  might  exist \nthat  did  not  clearly  fall  into  either  of  these  categories—the  “marginal” \ncategory  discussed “S22 in  Copley  Press.  lt  had  no  need  to  do  so,  because \nthe  documents  at  issue  clearly  fell  into  the  category  that  need  not  be \ndisclosed.  To  the  extent  Washington  Legal  implicitly rejected  the  existence \nof  such  a  category,  and  limited  the  right  of  public  access  to ““\"268 \ndocuments  that  memorialize  or  record  government  actions,  itis  not \nconsistent  with  the  California  case  law  on  the  right  of  public  access. \n5 \nThe  State  Bar  suggests  that  if  the  common  law  right  of  access  is  not  limited \nin  the  manner  it  proposes,  it  would  create  a  level  of  access  to  judicial \nbranch  records  that  is  equivalent  to  the  level  of  access  provided  in  the \nCPRA  and  thereby  effectively  eliminate  the  CPRA's  exemption  for  the \njudicial  branch.  The  CPRA  applies  to  “any  writing  containing  information \nrelating  to  the  conduct  of  the  public's  business  prepared,  owned,  used,  or \nretained  by  any  state  or  local  agency  regardless  of  physical  form  or \ncharacteristics,”  (sav ‘Code,   §  62 52,  subd.

The  CPRA  establishes  a  presumptive  right  of  access  to  any \nrecord  createc  or  maintained  by  a  public  agency  that  relates  in  any  way  to \nthe  business  of  the  public  agency,  and  the  record  must  be  disclosed  unless \na  Statutory  exception  is  shown.  Under  the  common  law,  on  the  other  hand, \nno  such  presumption  exists.  Although  the  official  records  of  government \nactions  have  historically  been  treated  as  subject  to  public  access  and  are \nreadily  categorized  as  “public  records,”  for  other  matters  or  types  of  records \na  determination  must  be  made  concerning  whether  the  records  at  issue \nshould  be  treated  as  public,  taking  into  account  the  public's  interest  in \ndisclosure  as  well  as  the  competing  interests  involved. \nA  report  to  a  legislative  committee  considering  a  predecessor  bill  to  the  bill \nthat  was  later  adopted  as  the  CPRA  identifies  this  difference  between  the \nway  public  records“ ““288  previously  were  defined  and  the  way  they  would \nbe  defined  uncer  the  proposed  legislation.  (Assem.  Com.  on  Government \nOrganization,  Staff  Rep.,  Cal.’s  Public  Records  Law  and  Proposed \nRevision,  prepared  for  hearing  Jan.  6  and  7,  1966  on  Assem.  Bill  No.  3015 \n(1966  Reg.  Sess.).)  The  pending  bill,  Assembly  Bill  No.  3015  (1966  Reg. \n2ess.),  contained  a  definition  of  public  records  similar  to  the  one  contained \nin  the  current  version  of  the  CPRA.  The  report  states  that  the  definition  of \npublic  records  under  existing  law  is  “broad  and  provides  little  guidance  in \ndetermining  whether  or  not  a  specific  document  is  a  public  record. \nGenerally,  the  courts  have  taken  a  restrictive  view  in  applying  these \nsections.  [J]  In  contrast,  AB  3015  begins  by  making  every  document a \npublic  record.  The  only  exceptions  are  those  which  are  specifically \nrecognized  by  the  Legisiature  (either  in  the  exemptions  outlined  in  the  bill \n   \nor  by  specific  statute).  The  significance  of  this  change  is  twofold:  (1)  the \nburden  for  determining  what  is  a  public  record  is  shifted;  (2)  it  limits  the \nauthority  of  administrators  to  withhold  records  unless  there  is  an  expressed \nstatutory  right  to  do  so.”  (Assem.  Com.  on  Government  Organization,  Staff \nRep.,  UPRA,  AT P.  6.) \n7 \nin  light  of  the  differences  between  the  common  law  approach  to  public \nrecords  and  the  CPRA's  approach,  we  see  no  conflict  between  the  CPRA's \nexemption of  judicial  branch  records  and  the  recognition  that  a  common \nlaw  right  of  access  continues  to  exist  in  records  of  those  public  entities  not \ngoverned  by  the  CPRA  in  which  there  is  a  legitimate  public  interest,  if  that \ninterest  is  not  outweighed  by  other  interests. \nE.  Application  of  Common  Law  Principles  to  the  Admissions \nDatabase \n7.  Public  interest  in  the  admissions  database \n8 \nApplying  the  principles  discussed  above,  the  admissions  database  falls  into \nthe “marginal”  third  category  of  records  identified  in  Copley  Press.  The *“32¢ \nadmissions  database  does  not  constitute  an  official  record  of  the  State \nBar's  actions  and  has  not  historically  been  treated  as  a  public  record.  On \nthe  other  hand,  the  admissions  database  coes  not  ““S88  fall  into  the \ncategory  of  preliminary,  predecisional  materials  whose  disclosure  could \nundermine  the  purposes  for  which  they  were  created  and  which  could  be \nmisieading  or  inaccurate.  The  admissions  database  could  be  characterized \nas  “  preliminary’  in  that  it  constitutes  the  rough  data  upon  which  the  bar's \npublished  statistical  reports  and  other  studies  are  based.

T0068.) Thus,  sIthough  plaintiff  SSa  nder’s  motive  in \nseeking  the  information  is  to  facilitate  his  research  regarding  law  school \nadmissions  practices,  we  focus  on  the  interest  of  the  general  public in  the \nactivities  of  the  State  Bar. \nThe  public  does  have  a  legitimate  interest  in  the  activities  of  the  State  Bar \nin  administering  the  bar  exam  and  the  admissions  process.  In  particular,  it \nseems  beyond  dispute  that  the  public  has  a  legitimate  interest  in  whether \ndifferent  groups  of  applicants,  based  on  race,  sex  or  ethnicity,  perform \ndifferently  on  the  bar  examination  and  whether  any  disparities  in \nperformance  are  the  result  of  the  admissions  process  or  of  other  factors. \nindeed,  the  State  Bar  uses  the  catabase  to  prepare  a  statistical  analysis  of \nthe  bar  exam  that  reports  the  bar  passage  rates  for  various  categories  of \napplicants.  Public  access  to  the  admissions  database  used  by  the  State \nBar  to  evaluate  its  admissions  process  would  allow  the  public  to \nindependently  ascertain  and  evaluate  that  process.  Therefore,  the  public's \ninterest  in  the  information  in  the  database  would  contribute  to  the  public's \nunderstanding  of  the  State  Bar's “325  admissions  activities,  and  is \nsufficient  to  warrant  further  consideration  of  whether  any  countervailing \nconsideration  weighs  against  public  access. \n2.  Promise  of  confidentiality \n10 \n17 \nThe  State  Bar  asserts  that,  notwithstanding  any  public  interest  in  the \nadmissions  database,  itis  not  subject  to  public  disclosure  because  the \ninformation  contained  in  it  was  obtained  from  applicants  under  a  promise \nthat  it  would  remain  confidential.  Under  longstanding  common  law  and \nstatutory  principles,  information  obtained  through  a  promise  of \nconfidentiality  is  not  subject  to  the  right  of  public  access  when  the  public \ninterest  would  be  furthered  by  maintaining  confidentiality.

(b)(2).) \nAS  we  have alluded  to  earlier,  however,  this  orinciple  has  not  prevented \npublic  access  to  otherwise  confidential,  private  information  in  the \npossession  of  a  public entity that |  is  not  linked  to the  individual  to  which  it \npertains.

Because  plaintiffs  do  not  seek  the  information  in a \nmanner  that  would  reveal  the  identities  of  individual  applicants,  the  State \nBar's  promises  of  confidentiality  do  not  necessarily  preclude  public  access \nto  the  database. \nSimilarly,  we  cannot  hold  as  a  matter  of  law  that  bar  applicants’ \nconstitutional  rights  of  privacy  preclude  disclosure  of  the  information  in  the \ndatabase  even  in  a  deidentified  form.  (See  val.  Canst.,  ar  3 4.)  The \nState  Bar  cites  this  court's  statement |  in | Wi  2¥.  Davis  4975)  1© 3  Cal.3d \nPSf,  FS,  120  Cal Rptr.

The \nState  Bar's  argument  that  disclosure  of  the  requested  data  would  violate \napplicants’  privacy  even  if  it  cannot  be  connected  to  them  as  individuals  is \nnot  supported  by  authority. \nThe  parties  disagree  concerning  whether  the  information  at  issue  can  be \nprovided  in  a  form  that  does  not  breach  the  State  Bar's  promises  of \nconfidentiality.  The  State  Bar  contends  that  “the  commonly  held \nassumption  that  any  data  can  be  successfully  [deidentified]  as  suggested \nby  [plaintiffs],  so  that  it  can  be  made  available  to  the  public  without  risk  that \nindividual  people's  information  be  revealed,  has  proved  to  be  false.” \nPlaintiffs  counter  that  “[clisciosure  of  de-identified  information  regarding \nindividuals  obtained  from  government  databases  is  commonplace....  The \nroutine  release  of  such  data  refutes  the  claim  that  such  information  cannot \nbe  disclosed  without  undue  risk  of  ‘re-identification’  of  those  individuals.” \nThis  issue  involves  disputed  questions  of  fact  that  we  are  not  currently  in  a \nposition  to  decide.  By  the  parties’  stipulation,  litigation  of  this  issue  was \nreserved  for  the  second  phase  of  trial  and  may  be  cecided  in  the  trial  court \nupon  remand. \n“32?  F.  Form  in  Which  the  Data  is  Kept \nThe  State  Bar  contends,  as  it  did  in  the  trial  court,  that  in  order  to  comply \nwith  Plaintifs’  request  without  infringing  bar  applicants’  privacy  interests  it \nwould  be  required  *““S0?  not  only  to  redact  personal  information  but  also  to \ncreate  new  categories  of  “2  information  by “clustering”  categories  of \ndata—a  measure  proposed  by  plaintiffs  to  make  it  more  difficult  to  reidentify \nindividuals.  The  State  Bar  concedes  that  if  the  admissions  database  is \nsubject  to  the  right  of  access  it  may  be  required  to  redact  applicants’ \nnames,  but  contends  that  making  the  changes  to  the  admissions  database \nnecessary  to  protect  applicants’  privacy  woulc  constitute  the  creation  of  a \n“new  record  and  that  creation  ofa  new  record  is  not  required.

The  parties  have  not  yet  litigated  whether  and  how \napplicants’  privacy  interests  could  be  protected  if  public  access  to  the \ndatabase  were  permitted.  Therefore,  we  do  not  yet  know  what \nmodifications  would  be  necessary  to  protect  these  countervailing  interests. \nFurthermore,  by  stipulation,  the  parties  reserved  for  the  second  phase  of \ntrial  the  question  whether  disclosure  would  impose  an  undue  burcen  on  the \nstate  Bar. \nPlaintiffs  have  made  clear  that  they  would  accept  the  data  in  its  current \nform,  without  any  modification  other  than  the  redaction  of  applicants’ \nnames.  They  have  proposed  additional  modifications  to  the  data,  including \nthe  “clustering”  of  data,  in  order  to  satisfy  the  State  Bar's  concerns  about \nbar  applicants’  privacy.  In  light  of  our  holding  recognizing  the  public's \ninterest  in  the  admissions  database,  the  State  Bar  may  choose  to \nimplement  these  proposals  or  may  propose  other  measures  that  will  satisfy \nthe  public's  right  of  access  while  protecting  applicants’  privacy.  if  not,  it  will \nbe  necessary  for  the  trial  court  to  resolve  whether  and  how  a  record  that  is \nresponsive  to  plaintiffs’  requests  may  be  produced  without  identifying \nindividual  applicants  or  otherwise  unduly  burdening  any  legitimate \ncompeting  interests. \n‘328  WV.

The  State Bar is  an agency of the  _ \njudicial  branch.  Stipulated  Facts  For Trial  Phase One,  filed  October  6,  2009  (“Fact”)  1. \nThe  parties  agree that the  data  should  be treated as  in the possession  of the judicial  branch \n ' In the alternative  Petitioners seek declaratory and injunctive relief.\nand  are  subject to  disclosure  to  the  extent  documents  in  the  possession  of the  courts  must \nbe made  publicly available. \n|  The  data  sought pertain  to  applicants  for the  state  Bar  exam,  and  include  the \napplicants’  race,  law  schools  attended,  year  graduated  from  law  school,  Bar passage  rate, \nand  exam  scores  from  their  law  schools  and  from the  Law  School Admissions  Test \n(LSAT).  Fact 23.  Sander requested  this  data  from  the  State  Bar  and was  turned  down. \nFact  25. \nThis  suit  followed. \nB. \nThe parties  agreed to,  and  I  ordered,  a bifurcated trial.  The  first phase  is  based  on \nthe  pleadings  and  stipulated  facts.  It  decides  whether  Sander has  any  legal  entitlement to \nthe  data in the  State  Bar’s  database.  Specifically,  in this  Phase  One  I  am to  determine \nwhether  data in  question  are  public  records  available  to  any member  of the  public  and \nwhether the  provision  of the  requested  data  would  require  the  creation  of a  ‘new’  record \nwhich,  the  State  Bar  contends,  need  not be  created  to  comply with  a public  records \nrequest.  If I  decide  in favor  of Sander  here,  then  Phase  Two  would  address privacy  and \nburden  issues  implicated  by  Sander’s  request. \nSander’s  petition  is  based  on  (1)  the  state  common  law right  of access  to  court \nrecords  and  (2)  Proposition  59,  a ballot measure  which passed  in  2004  endorsing  the \npublic’s  right  of access  to  information  and  directing  access  to  “the writings  of public \nofficials.”  Cal.  Constit.  Art.  1  §  3  (b)(1).\nWhile  Sander  spends  some  time  in his  brief describing the  research  for  which \nPetitioners  desire  the  data,  their  goals,  and  the  asserted public  interest  and  utility  of the \ndata  sought,”  I  agree  with the  State  Bar that these  matters  are not pertinent  because  the \npurpose  of  Sander’s  request  is  irrelevant.  City  of San Jose  v.  Superior  Court,  74 \nCal.App.4th  1008,  1018  (1999).  The  only  issue here  is  whether any member  of the \npublic,  for  any  reason,  has  a right to  the  data  sought. \nFollowing  my  written tentative  ruling  of March  10,  2010,  the  parties  argued the \ncase  on March  19,  2010.  On  March  24,  2010,  I  signed  a Proposed  Statement  of Decision, \nand received  objections  from  Petitioners  April  7,  2010.  I  also  received  Respondent’s \n“Response” to  those  objections;  I  agree  with  Petitioners  that there  is  no  authority  for that \nResponse  and  so  I  have  ignored  it. \nThis  decision  follows. \nI.  Common  Law  Right of Access \nOur  starting  point  must  be  NBC Subsidiary  (KNBC-TV),  Inc.  v.  Superior  Court, \n20  Cal.4th  1178,  1209  (1999).  This  case  provided  the  basis  for the  statewide  rules  of \ncourt which  govern public  access  to  documents  filed  with  the  courts.  CRC  2.550  et  seq. \n(see  accompanying  Advisory  Committee  comments);  Mercury Interactive  Corp.  v.  Klein, \n158  Cal.App.4th  60,  81,  84  (2007).  Based  on traditional  analyses  of First  Amendment \nright  of access  to  court proceedings,  our  Supreme  Court noted the  now classic  distinction \nbetween  (i)  proceedings  and  documents  related  to  adjudication?  and  (ii)  other documents: \n  \n2 E.g., Petitioners’  Opening Brief,  filed December 7,  2009  at 2-6;  10-12. \n*  To be more precise,  traditional  access  is to  documents  filed with the  court and which become the basis  for \nadjudication.  That is the  conclusion of the  exhaustive  analysis of NBC Subsidiary by the  Sixth District \nCourt of Appeal. Mercury Interactive Corp.  v.  Klein,  158  Cal.App.4th 60  et passim  (2007).\nNumerous  reviewing courts  likewise  have  found  a First Amendment right  of \naccess  to  civil  litigation  documents  filed  in  court  as  a basis  for  adjudication.  .... \nSimilarly,  in  Copley Press,  Inc.  v.  Superior  Court (1992)  6  Cal.App.4th  106  [7 \nCal.Rptr.2d  841]  (Copley Press),  the  Court  of Appeal  ruled  that the  press  had  a \nright to  inspect the  clerk's  “rough  minute”  books  of a  California trial  court.  The \nreviewing  court  observed  that  “in  general”  the  First Amendment provides  “broad \naccess  rights  to judicial  hearings  and  records  ...  both  in  criminal  and  civil  cases.” \n(d.,  at p.  111.)  By  contrast,  decisions  have  held that  the  First Amendment does \nnot  compel  public  access  to  discovery materials  that  are  neither used  at trial  nor \nsubmitted  as  a basis  for  adjudication.  [Citations] \nNBC Subsidiary,  20  Cal.4th  at  1209  n.25. \nA  fully  integrated part  of this  scheme  is  the  recognition that the  common  law  or \ntraditional  First  Amendment  right  of access  cannot  and  does  not  extend to  a variety  of \nitems,  such  as  grand jury  transcripts, judges’  private  deliberations  and  conferences, \npreliminary  drafts  of orders,  and the  like.  /d@,  20  Cal.4th  at  1212  n.29.  See  also,  Copley \nPress,  Inc.  v.  Superior  Court,  6  Cal.  App.4th  106,  114  (1992)(no  disclosure  of \n“preliminary  drafts,  personal  notes  and  rough  records”);  People  v.  Dixon,  148 \nCal.App.4th 414,  424  e¢ seq.  (2007)(variety  of proceedings  and  documents  not  open  to \npublic),  The  California  Supreme  Court has  reaffirmed the  scope  of the  traditional  right  of \naccess. \n[Our]  decisions ...  have  been  careful  not to  extend the  public's  right  of access \nbeyond  the  adjudicative  proceedings  and  filed  documents  of trial and appellate \ncourts. \nCopley Press,  Inc.  v.  Superior  Court,  39  Cal.4th  1272,  1303  (2006)(emphasis  in \noriginal)(noting  congruence  with U.S.  Supreme  Court  analyses).  | \nThe  issue  then  devolves  to  whether the  data requested by  Sander fall within  the \nscope  of documents  in  the  possession  of the judicial  branch  traditionally  subject to  public\ndisclosure.  They plainly  do  not.*  None  of the  data at issue  is presented  to  a  court  and \nnone  ever  is  used  in any  form  of adjudicatory proceeding,  even  within the  confines  of the \nState  Bar  with respect,  for example,  to  how  any  applicant is  processed.  That  is,  even  were \nI  to  expand  the  notion  of ‘adjudication’  to  reach the  work  of the  State  Bar  in  evaluating \nits  applicants,  the  data  sought  by  Sander  would not  qualify. \nI.  Judicial Records \nA. \nAnother  series  of cases  requires review.  Both  sides  cite Pantos  v.  City and \nCounty of San Francisco,  151  Cal.App.3d  258,  262  (1984)  in  support  of their respective \npositions.  Sander argues  that it  establishes  a far more  general  right to  documents  than the \n‘adjudicatory’  records  I  refer to  above: \nThe  law favors  maximum public  access  to judicial  proceedings  and  court  records. \n(See Press-Enterprise  Company v.  Superior  Court  (1984)  501  U.S.  464  [...]; \nGlobe  Newspaper  Co.  v.  Superior  Court (1982)  457  U.S.  596,  604-605  [...]. \nJudicial  records  are  historically  and presumptively  open to  the  public  and there  is \nan important right  of access  which  should  not be  closed  except  for  compelling \ncountervailing  reasons.  (See  Code  Civ.  Proc.,  3  1904.)  No  such reasons  have  been \npresented. \nPantos,  151  Cal.App.3d  at 262-263. \nSander  cites  other  cases  to  the  same  effect,  that  is,  court records  are public \nrecords,  Estate  of Hearst,  67  Cal.App.3d  777,  782  (1977),  and unless  there  is  a \ncountervailing policy  reason  (such  as  privacy),  the  records  must  be  disclosed.  See \nSander’s  Opening  Brief at  24  et  seq.  Sander  cites  Copley to  the  same  effect.  “Court \n  \n* As  Sander notes,  the parties here agree that the records sought are  “non-adjudicatory.” Petitioners’  Reply \nto Respondents’  Phase  [  Trial Brief,  filed February  16, 2010  at  18.\nrecords  are  public  records  open  to inspection.”  Copley Press,  Inc.  v.  Superior  Court,  6 \nCal.App.4th  106,  112  (1992). \nBut the  foci  in  all  these  cases  are  ‘judicial  records’  as  defined  by  C.C.P.  §  1904, \nand  the preliminary  enquiry  must  be  whether the  documents  sought  so  qualify.  E.g., \nCopley,  6  Cal.App.4th  at  112.  That  is, this entirely  general  right  of access  is  limited to \njudicial  records.  While  Copley’s  discussion reveals the sometimes  difficult business  of \ndistinguishing  some  clerks’  records  from  others,  it  is  essential  not  to  lose  sight  of the \nunderlying  definition  of judicial  records  as  “the  record  or  official  entry  of the proceedings \nin  a court  of justice,  or  of the  official  act of a judicial  officer,  in  an  action  or  special \nproceeding.”  C.C.P.  §  1904.  The  fact that  Copley,  Pantos,  and  other  cases paint witha \nbroad  brush—broader than NBC Subsidiary’s references  to  adjudicatory  documents—is \nof no  consequence  outside  the  bounded  universe  of “judicial  records”  and  does  not,  as \nSander  argues,  provide  authority  for the  general  release  of all  non-adjudicatory \ndocuments.  Sander’s  Opening  Brief at  25.°  And,  of course,  a review of the  definition  of \n‘judicial  records’  shows  that the  data  sought  by  Sander  cannot possibly  qualify. \nCompare,  Copley,  6  Cal.App.4\"  at  113  Gudicial  records  represent  and  reflect  work  of the \ncourts). \nB. \nAt  argument  Sander  objected  to  the  schema outlined  above.  Sander disclaims \nreliance  on NBC Subsidiary,  dubbing  it  a constitutional  approach which  concededly does \n  \n°  Sander notes that Mack v.  State Bar of California,  92  Cal.App.4th 957,  962-963  (2001) authorizes the \nrelease of data which  is  plainly not a judicial record but,  Sander argues,  nevertheless  compelled by \ntraditional  First Amendment principles.  Mack does  assume the  state bar disciplinary records there  are \n‘public records’  and then invokes the strong policies  which favor disclosure.  But the reason those\nnot authorize  the  release  of the  contested  data.  Sander  instead  relies  on what  he \ndistinguishes  as  the  common  law right  of access,  which  pre-dates  the  constitutional  rule, \nassertedly  exemplified  by  cases  such  as  Copley  and Pantos  but which  is  not  limited to  the \nscope  of ‘judicial  records’  or  ‘adjudicatory’  records. \n_  The  cited  case  law  does  not  support  Sander.  Pantos,  for  example,  in  fact  focuses . \non  “judicial  records,”  rests  on  the  logic  of open judicial  proceedings,  and  is \nfundamentally premised  on the  rationale  of  Press-Enterprise  Company v.  Superior \nCourt,  464  U.S.  501  (1984).  Pantos,  151  Cal.App.3d  at  262  -263.  Press-Enterprise,  in \nturn,  makes  it plain  both  that  (i)  the  common law history®  of open trials  focuses  on the \nadjudicatory  business  of courts,  and  (ii)  it  is  this  tradition  which  informs  the  scope  of the \nFirst Amendment.  Press-Enterprise  Co.,  464  U.S.  501,  509  n.8.  Precisely  the  same \nhistorical  analysis  of the  common  law had  been  used to  describe  the  import  of the  First \nAmendment in Richmond Newspapers,  Inc.  v.  Virginia,  448  U.S.  555,  564-565  (1980). \nThe  Supreme  Court  is  clear that  “right of access  is  embodied  in the  First Amendment, \nand  applied to  the  States  through the  Fourteenth Amendment.”  Globe  Newspaper  Co.  v. \nSuperior  Court for Norfolk County,  457  U.S.  596,  603  ( 1982).’  See  generally,  D.  Schulz \net  al.,  “2009  Update:  Developments  In  The  Law Of Access,”  Communications Law  in  the \nDigital Age  2009  988  PLI/Pat  345  (PLI  2009)(constitutional  and  common law right  of \naccess).  The  common  law  of access  has  in  effect  been  absorbed by the  constitutional _ \nrule. \n  \nparticular  State Bar documents  were public records was because Business & Professions  Code  §  6086.1 \n.  said so.  Mack,  92  Cal.App.4th at 961.  Sander does not argue that  §  6086.1  applies here. \n°  The  Supreme Court takes  us  back to before the Norman Conquest of 1066.  464  U.S.  at 505  n.1. \n” Earlier, the  Supreme  Court in Nixon v.  Warner Communications,  435  U.S.  589  (1978) noted a ‘common \nlaw’  right to  access  “public”  documents  including judicial records.  435  U.S.  at  597 & n.8.  The  cases  cited \nby the Court in that footnote all exemplify access to judicial records, that is,  those forming the basis  for \nadjudication.  .  .\nFinally,  NBC Subsidiary  itself—the  case  on  which  Sander now  disclaims \nreliance—telies  on  and  treats  Copley  as  an  example  of the  First Amendment right  to \naccess  to judicial  records.  NBC Subsidiary,  20  Cal.4th  at  1209  n.25.  Sander’s  attempt to \nrely  on  Copley  and  avoid the  logic  of NBC Subsidiary must  fail. \nC. \nSander may  mean to  suggest that the  common  law contemplates  not  only  the \nrelease  of judicial  records,  but  also  ‘public  records’  generally.  This  is  so.  Nixon  v. \nWarner  Communications,  435  U.S.  589,  598  nn.7  &  8.  There,  the  Court  cited  a series  of \ncases  which  recognize  the  common  law right  entirely  apart from  its  impact  on the  courts. \nMost  of these  cited  cases®  simply  assume  that the  records  are  ‘public’  and  so  by  default \n_  ought  to  be disclosed.  This  does  not  help  us  here,  because  neither Nixon  nor  any  other \ncase  nor  argument  presented by  Sander’ provides  criteria  by  which I  can  determine \nwhether the  data  sought  in this  case  are  ‘public’  records—except,  as  noted  below in \nconnection  with  Proposition  59,  criteria which  are  so  broad  as  to  be  self-defeating. \nUltimately,  Sander  does  not provide  a  coherent  description  of the  common  law \nscope  of ‘public  records’  which  would  authorize  the  relief he  seeks  here.  Indeed,  the \nauthority  he  seeks  from  that history  is  likely unavailable:  the  common  law even  after  its \n  \n* The exceptions  are Fayette  County v.  Martin,  279 Ky.  387,  395-396,  130  S.W.2d 838,  843  (1939\\state \nstatute bars release,  superseding common law); State ex rel.  Nevada Title Guaranty &  Trust Co.  v.  Grimes, \n29 Nev.  50,  82-86,  84 P.  1061,  1072-1074  (1906)(some records public, some are not).  435  U.S.  at 598  n.7. \n*  Sander’s  argument on non-judicial common law access  confusingly relies  on cases  which  address judicial \nrecords,  Petitioner’s  Opening Brief at 24  et seq.;  Reply Brief at 6  et seq.  But these records,  as noted \nabove,  comprise  a limited  set of document not at issue here.  Too,  Sander relies  on cases such as Richmond \nNewspapers, supra,  to  establish this more  general common law right of access,  despite the fact that those \ncases are peculiarly focused on the  common law  foundation of the constitutional right to  open trials  and \ncourt documents;  again,  not at issue here.  Petitioners’  Reply Brief at  8  et seq.,  citing Richmond \nNewspapers, NBC Subsidiary, Nixon,  etc.\n_atrival  on  these  shores was  restrictive,  generally  authorizing  release  of documents  only to \nthose  with  ae.g.,  pecuniary  interest.  See,  e.g.,  cases  discussed  in State  v.  Grimes,  84  P. \n1061,  1072  (Nev.  1906)(Grimes  is  cited  in Nixon,  435  U.S.  at  598  n.8  as  one  the  key \ncases  exemplifying  the  non judicial  records  common  law right of access).  So  too, \ndissatisfaction with the  miserly  scope  of common  law access  likely  was  a central  reason \nfor  Legislative  action  in  enacting,  for  example,  the  California Public  Records  Act  and its \nfederal  counterpart,  the  Freedom  of Information Act,  5  U.S.C.  §  552  (FOIA)  “enacted  to \nfacilitate  public  access  to  Government  documents,”  U.S.  Dep't of State  v.  Ray,  502  U.S. \n164,  173  (1991).  See  e.g.,  BRV,  Inc.  v.  Superior  Court,  143  Cal.App.4th  742,  750 \n(2006)(CPRA  enacted  in  order  “to  give  the public  access  to  information  in possession of \npublic  agencies”).  Indeed,  it  is  clear that  “the  CPRA  was  enacted  for  the  purpose  of \nincreasing freedom  of information by  giving  members  of the public  access  to  information \nin the  possession  of public  agencies,”  County of Santa  Clara  v.  Superior  Court,  170 \nCal.App.4th  1301,  1319  (2009)(internal  quotes  omitted  and  emphasis  supplied).  In  short, \nwere  non-judicial  records  common  law rights  of access  as  broad  as  claimed by  Sander, \nthere  would have  been  little  need  for the  FOIA  or  CPRA. \nThus,  while  the  common  law rule  by  definition pre-dates  the  adoption  of the \nconstitutional  requirement,  here  there  is  no  useful  distinction  between the  two. \nIV.  Proposition  59 \nSander  argues  that  Proposition  59,  passed  by the  voters  in 2004,  provides  an \nindependent basis  for the  release  of the  data he  seeks.  But  Proposition  59  did  not  change\nthe  substantive  law.  As  the  Court  of Appeal  has  repeated,  “Proposition  59  is  simply  a \nconstitutionalization  of the  CPRA  [California Public  Records  Act].””° \nIt  is  true  that  court records  are  not  covered  by  the  CPRA  in  any  event.  Copley \nPress,  Inc.  y.  Superior  Court,  6  Cal.App.4th  106,  111  (1992).  Access  to  court  records, \nrather,  has  traditionally been  a  function  of long  standing  common  law  and  First \nAmendment  interests  such  as  those  discussed  above. \nThus  the  issue  may  be  reframed whether Proposition  59,  which  did not modify the \nCPRA  (a  statute),  nevertheless  did modify traditional  constitutional  tests  including  for \nexample  Article  1  §  2  of our  state  Constitution  which underlies  the  traditional  test.'! \nSander urges  Proposition  59  as  an  independent  basis  for  the  data  sought,  arguing \nthat  it  covers  every writing without  exception,’ *  regardless  of whether  a public  official \nwrote  it  or  simply  possessed  it.  Sander  Opening  Brief at  21.  Every  document  in the \npossession  of the  courts  must presumptively be  open  to  public  access.’?  This  is  a \nstunning  shift  from  what  I  have  termed  the  traditional  test.  Sander provides  no  evidence \nthat the  voters  meant the  Proposition to  have  such  a remarkable  reach  in modifying  the \nstate  Constitution  and  decades  of legal  development.  The  evidence  of voter intent \nsubmitted  by  Sander,'*  too,  is  consistent with  no  more  than the  constitutionalization  of \nextant rights. > \n  \n10 Sutter's Place v.  Superior Court,  161  Cal.App.4th  1370,  1382  (2008),  citing,  BRV,  Inc.  v.  Superior Court, \n143  Cal.App.4th 742,  749  (2006). See also, Savaglio v.  Wal-Mart Stores,  Inc.,  149  Cal.App.4th  588,  597- \n598  (2007); Los Angeles  Unified School Dist.  v.  Superior Court,  151  Cal.App.4th 759  (2007). \n''  This  is  California’s  ‘free speech’  provision,  analogous to the federal First Amendment. \n2  That is, anything that the Evidence  Code considers to be a writing.  Sander’s  Opening Brief at 20. \n3  “The requested records  are unquestionably writings of a public  agency.  They relate to the  conduct of the \npeople’s business.  They are, therefore,  subject to the right of access  created by Proposition 59.....”  Sander \nOpening Brief at 23. \n'*  Sander’s Opening Brief at  17-18;  19-20. \n'S Indeed, much of Sander’s argument on the  import of Proposition 59  is based on the meaning of similar \nterms  in pre-existing statutes.  Sander Opening Brief at e.g.,  21. \n10\nNor  does  the  plain  language  of the Proposition  support  Sander’s  reading.  The \nProposition prescribes  “public  scrutiny”  of (1)  “meetings  of public  bodies”  and  (2) \n“writings  of public  officials.”  Cal.  Constit.  Art.  1  §  3(b)( 1).  On  its  face,  this  does  not \nsuggest  the  mandatory  disclosure  of documents  aside  from judicial  records  nor  of the  data \nsought  by  Sander  (which  is  not  even the  writing  of a public  official  but rather  data \ncollected  from  applicants).  As  the State  Bar  intimates,  if Proposition  59  truly  expanded \nthe  universe  of documents  to  be  disclosed  to  all papers  in the  possession  of the \ngovernment,  parts  of the  Proposition which  govern the  constructioofn  extant  law on \ndisclosure  would  be  at  best  surplusage.  See  e.g.,  Cal.  Constit.  Art.  1  §  3(b)(2)  &  (3). \nFinally,  the  wording  of the  Proposition  itself confirms  the applicability  of  extant  law— \nand by that  I  mean  more  than  simply  statutory law such  as  the  CPRA,  but also  other \n“authority”  which  I  take  to  mean the  constitutional  common  law discussed  above: \nA  statute,  court rule,  or  other  authority,  including  those  in  effect  on  the  effective \ndate  of this  subdivision,  shall  be  broadly  construed  if it furthers  the people's  right \nof access,  and  narrowly  construed  if it  limits  the  right  of access. \nCal.  Const.  Art.  1  §  3  (a)(2)(emphasis  supplied). \nThe  Courts  have,.in  fact,  usually  executed  this  mandate to  broadly  construe  the  | \npeople’s  right  of access.  The Court  did  so  in,  for  example,  NBC Subsidiary back  in  1999 \nlong  before  Proposition  59,  20  Cal.4™  at  1212  -1213. \nAt  argument,  Sander pressed  an  additional  ‘plain  language’  contention.  He  notes \n_  that  Proposition  59  itself carves  out the  areas  of existing  law which  are preserved,  and  by \nimplication  other  areas  are  not.  Cal.  Constit.  Art.  1  §  3(3)-(6).'°  These  provisions,  in - \n  \n'® Sander’s argument here of implicit repeal—that is, that Proposition 59  creates new law entitling him to \nthe data sought in this  case—impliedly concedes that he is not entitled to the data under traditional common \nlaw or First Amendment tests. \n11\norder,  preserve  law  on privacy,  constitutional  and  statutory  bases,  and  legislative \nconfidentiality.  All  documents  not  covered  by  such  exemptions — presumably \nexemptions  described  only  in  case  law  (aside  from  those  related  to  privacy)—:must be \ndisclosed,  Sander  argues.  This  obliterates  centuries  of common  law  analyses.  Whatever \nthe  other merits  of this  contention  (and  it  contradicts  Sutter's Place,  supra note  10),  it \nmust  rely,  at  least,  on  a  clear  and precise  distinction between the  constitutional  and \ncommon  law  analyses  which,  for reasons  stated  above,  is  not  available. \nAs  a  commentator has  noted,  the  Proposition  states policy,  but  does  not  create  a \nspecific  right: \nBut with the  arguable  exception  of a  subdivision  affirmatively  shielding  the \nlegislature  from  sunshine  laws,  the  amendment  is  largely  a policy  statement and  a \npositioning  of the  newly  declared  access  right relative  to  other  constitutional \nrights,  rather  than  a  guarantee  of particular rights and responsibilities.  Those  tasks \nare  left to  existing  open-government  legislation.\" \nIn the  end,  Sander’s  argument proves  too  much.  If Proposition  59  were  an \nindependent  basis  for  disclosure,  eviscerating traditional  common  law  first  amendment \nanalyses  and presumptively requiring the  production  of every  document  in the  hands  of \nthe judicial  branch—and  that is  Sander’s  argument  here,  supra notes  12-13—then judges’ \nrough  notes  and  other  internal  documents,  which under traditional  law  are  not to  be \ndisclosed  (Copley Press,  6  Cal.App.4™  at  114-115)  would  be  open  for public  inspection. \nSo  too  grand jury transcripts  would  have to  be  disclosed—but they  are  not: \nThe  amendments  under  Proposition  59  do  not  affect  our  interpretation  of section \n938.1.  Article  I,  section  3,  subdivision  (b)(5)  of the  California  Constitution, \nprovides, “This  subdivision  does  not repeal  or nullify,  expressly  or  by  implication, \nany  constitutional  or  statutory  exception to  the  right  of access  to  public  records  or \nmeetings  of public  bodies  that  is  in  effect  on the  effective  date  of this \n  \n'”  Karen Petroski,  “Lessons For Academic Freedom Law:  The California Approach  To University \nAutonomy And Accountability,”  32  J.C. & U.L.  149, 203-04  (2005). \n12\nsubdivision....” \nAlvarez v.  Superior  Court,  154  Cal.App.4th  642,  657  (2007).  See  also Mercury \nInteractive  Corp.  v.  Klein,  158  Cal.App.4th  60,  101  (2007)(Proposition  59  as  a \nrule  of construction). \nFor this  reason, Alvarez  rejected  the  argument  that  Proposition  59 had  gutted \nearlier traditional  common law on the  right  of access  to  grand  jury  transcripts.  Indeed,  I \nhave  found  no case  that  supports  the  notion that  Proposition  59  overturns  former law on \ndisclosure  of documents;  quite  the  contrary.\" \nV.  California Rule  of Court  10.500 \nFollowing  the  opening  salvo  of briefs  in  this  case  the  Judicial  Council  enacted \nCRC  10.500 which  requires  the judicial  branch to  allow  inspection  and  copying  of \n|  judicial  records.  Thus,  I  invited the parties  to  comment  on the  applicability  of this  Rule \nto  the  present  dispute,  Order  of January  25,  2010,  and both  sides  have  done  so.  As  the \nState  Bar notes,  the  Rule  itself states  that it  applies  solely to  the  courts  (as  well  as  the \nAdministrative  Office  of the  Courts),  CRC  10.500(c)(3).  The  Council  expressly \nconsidered  and  rejected  efforts  to expand the  Rule’s  coverage  to  the  State Bar? \nSander  argues  that  I  should nevertheless  supersede  the  Judicial  Council’s  view of \nthe  scope  of its  Rule  and  more  broadly  construe  it,  in  conformity  with the  legislation \nwhich  originally  directed  the  Council  to  enact the  Rule.  Petitioners’  Reply to \nRespondents’  Phase  I  Trial  Brief,  filed  February  16,  2010,  at  19-20. \n  \n'8  Compare cases cited supra n.10.  | \nReport  Summary and Report,  Request for Judicial Notice  in  Support of Respondents’  Phase I  Sur-Reply, \nEtc.,  filed on or about February 22,  2010,  at 91.  This  includes documents prepared in conjunction with the \nCouncil public  comment process.  Petitioners’  request for judicial notice  of the  document,  dated February \n22,  2010,  is granted. \n13\nIt  is  a heady  suggestion,  but  I must decline.  First,  the  enabling  legislation  does \nnot  instruct the  Council  to  enact  rules  governing  the  State  Bar.  Govt.  C.  §  68016.2. \nSecond,  even  if the  legislation  did  contain the  mandate,  there  is  no  authority permitting  a \ntrial  court  effectively to  bypass  the  procedures  of the  Judicial  Council  (including  its  use \nof committees,  votes  by  the  Council  proper,  and public  comment process),  and  enact  a \nrule  of court which the  court believes  is  required  by  enabling  legislation.  It would  be a \nvery  odd  situation  indeed  if trial  courts  had that  authority.  Where  a rule  of court conflicts \nwith  superseding  law,  such  as  legislation,  the  remedy  is  to  invalidate  the  rule,  not re-write \nit.  E.g.,  California  Court Reporters Assn.  v.  Judicial  Council  of California,  39 \nCal.App.4th  15,  33-34  (1995).  See  generally, Elkins  v,  Superior  Court,  41  Cal.4th  1337, \n1352  (2007)(invalidation  of rules  when inconsistent  with  superseding  authority).  Of \ncourse,  Sander  does  not  ask  me  to  invalidate the  Rule,  nor would  doing so  provide  him \nthe  relief he  seeks. \nVA  Production  of Records \nThis  first phase  of the  trial  contemplates  my  evaluation  of the  extent to  which \n_  Petitioners  are  seeking  the  production  of ‘new’  records,  because  if I  hold that this  is  so, \nthen I  may  find  for  the  State  Bar  in  any  event. \nI  do  not reach a  decision  on  the  matter here  for two  reasons.  First, given my \nconclusions  above,  I  need  not reach  it.  Second,  as discussed  below  the  record  is \ninsufficient. \n14\nI  note  that  the  parties  do  not,  exactly,  disagree  that  ‘new’  records  need  not  be  created \nby the  State  Bar.  Nor  do  the  parties  disagree  that the  State  Bar has  in  its  possession  all \nthe  data  sought  by the  Petitioners.  The  crux  of the  dispute  is  the  extent to  which  data in \nelectronic  records,  which  must  be  massaged  to  some  extent  for production,  thereby \nbecome  ‘new’  records.  See  e. g,  Petitioners’  Reply to  Respondents’  Phase  I  Brief at  26  & \nn.9.  As  Sander notes,  in  other  contexts  it is  understood that  a  governmental  agency,  or \nindeed  any producing  party,  may  need to  engage  in  some  such pro gramming.”  See \ngenerally,  County  of Santa  Clara  y.  Superior  Court,  170  Cal.App.4\"  1301,  1336,  citing \nGovt.  C.  §  6253.9(b).  See  e.g.,  Schladetsch  v.  U.S.  Dept of H.U.D.,  2000  WL  33372125, \n3  (D.D.C.  2000).  In  the  context  of digital  data,  it  does  not  make  much  sense  to  consider \nsimply whether  a  document  demand requires  the  creation  of a  ‘new’  document  since \nevery  production  of electronically  stored  data literally creates  a  ‘new’  document  on \nscreen,  on paper,  or  in  a  ‘new’  digital  file.”  In  some  contexts,  merely transforming  a \ndocument  from  one  electronic  format  into  another might be  treated  as  the  creation  of a \n‘new’  document.  E.g.,  Hagenbuch  v.  3B6 Sistemi  Elettronici  Industriali  S.R.L.,  2006  WL \n665005,  at  *3  (N.D.  Ill.  Mar.  8,  2006).  In  other  contexts,  it  is  routine  to  direct the \ncompilation  of extant  data,  e.¢g.,  Person  v.  Farmers Ins.  Group  of Companies,  52 \nCal.App.4th  813,  818  (1997),  including the  use  of queries  to  a database.  E.g.,  Jinks- \nUmstead v.  England,  227  F.R.D.  143,  148  (D.D.C.  2005). \n  \n?° Nevertheless the parties  were unable to cite California authority on the  issue whether public  agencies \nhave a duty to  create  ‘new’  record from the  data available.  Petitioners  instead rely on  for example \nconstructions  of federal and others  states’  public disclosure  statutes.  E.g.,  N.  L.  R.  B.  v.  Sears,  Roebuck & \nCo.,  421  U.S.  132,  162  (1975)(construing  federal  Freedom of Information Act); State ex rel.  Kerner v.  State \nTeachers Retirement Bd.,  82  Ohio  St.3d 273, 274,  695 N.E.2d 256,  258  (Ohio, 1998). \n*!  “Programming”  in this  lay sense generally  includes  any form of provision of instructions to  a computer, \nincluding the creation of a report form  by which data is assembled for viewing.  See generally, \nhttp://www.wordreference.com/definition/programming.  . \n15\nThe  very  notion  of what  comprises  a digital  ‘document’  depends  on a  variety  of \nfactors,  for  a  ‘document’  may  or may  include,  for  example,  metadata,  drafts,  attachments, \nand  data  otherwise  “pointed to”  and  in  effect  incorporated  into  a file.  As  the  Sedona \nConference  has  noted,  the  data  at  stake  here  is  “Dynamic  and  Changeable”: \nComputer  information,  unlike  paper,  has  content that  is  designed to  change  over \ntime  even without human  intervention.  Examples  include:  workflow  systems  that \nautomatically update  files  and  transfer  data  from  one  location to  another;  backup \napplications  that  move  data from  one  storage  area to  another  to  function properly;  web \npages  that  are  constantly updated  with  information  fed  from  other applications;  and \nemail  systems  that  reorganize  and purge  data  automatically.  As  a result,  unlike  paper \ndocuments,  much  electronically  stored  information  is  not  fixed  in  a final  form. \nMore  generally,  electronically  stored  information  is  more  easily  and  more \nthoroughly  changeable  than paper  documents.  Electronically  stored  information  can be \nmodified  in  numerous  ways  that  are  sometimes  difficult to  detect without  computer \nforensic  techniques.  Moreover,  the  act of merely  accessing  or moving  electronic  data \ncan  change  it.  For  example,  booting  up  a computer may  alter  data contained  on  it. \nSimply moving  a word  processing  file  from  one  location to  another  may change \ncreation  or modification  dates  found  in  the  metadata.” \nWhether  a production  involves  the  creation  of a  ‘new’  document  likely implicates \nspectra of (i)  efforts  in  making the production  and  (ii)  relationship  between  extant  data \nand  that demanded.  At  one  end,  the  wholesale  substitution  of one  kind  of data for \nanother may  be  so  close  to  the  creation  of a  substantively  new record that  it  should  not be \nordered,  as  Respondents  suggest.  Respondents’  Phase  One  Trial  Brief at,  e.g.,  23.  And \nat the  other  end  of a  spectrum the  level  of ‘manipulation’  may be no  more  than  creating  a \nsimple  form  identifying  which  extant  data to  print  out,  ‘redacting’  (or not  selecting)  other \ndata.  E.g.,  Petitioners’  Reply to  Respondents’  Phase  I  Trial  Brief at  e.g.,  22.\"  See \n  \n*2 Typically data stored  in  databases  are contained in fields, which are then collected  on a as-needed basis \npursuant to  varying criteria to create a report.  E.g.,  http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/database \n* http://www.thesedonaconference.org/dltForm?did=TSC_PRINCP_2nd_ed_607.pdf at 3. \n*4 In analogous  discovery  contexts,  courts understand that databases may need to be queried to produce \nselected series  of data.  E.g.,  Powerhouse  Marks,  L.L.C.  v.  Chi Hsin Impex,  Inc.,  2006  WL 83477  (E.D. \nMich.  Jan.  12,  2006).  I recognize that CRC  10.500(e)(1)(B) provides  where that Rule controls, no new \n16\ngenerally,  Lisa  M.

Diagrams  of the  steps  involved \n(Respondents’  Phase  One  Trial  Brief at  25)  are  not  entirely useful  in this  regard.  It \nappears  that the  relational  database  maintained  by the  State  Bar  (Fact 26)  includes  the \ndata  sought  by  Sander  (Facts  28 et seq.),  and  thus  it  is  likely that  a  query  can  be \nformulated  to  extract the  data  sought.’*  But  without  expert  declarations  on  the  matter, \nwhich  do  not  beg  the  question  of the  extent to  which  ‘new’  data or  its  arrangement  are \ninvolved,  this  issue  is  not ripe  for  adjudication. \nVil.  =  Evidentiary objections \nNone  of the  items  subject to  evidentiary  dispute  is  material  to  the  discussions \nabove.  I  had  originally  declined to  rule  on the  objections,  but  Sander has  repeatedly \nasked  me  to  do  so.  On reconsideration,  my  earlier  approach  appears  tantamount to  ruling \nthat the  relevancy  objections  were  sustained  and  with the  exception noted,  I  do  now make \nthat ruling.  Details  pertaining to  the  evidence  are  found  in  Appendix  A,  appended here. \n  \ncompilation or assemblage  of data need be undertaken.  But to date J have not seen  any authority that \nsuggests  Respondents  are correct I should follow this  Rule here,  and  indeed in a different context \nRespondents urge  I not follow it.

In both  cases,  Petitioners’  contentions  reduce  to  the \nassertion that they  are  entitled  to  ‘public  documents,’  but they  are unable  to  articulate  a \nprincipled  definition  of the notion  save  and  except  an  overbroad  definition  that  includes \nall  information  in the possession  of a public  agency.  The  law  applicable  to  the  courts \nbefore  Proposition  59  was  not that  broad;  and  there  is  no  evidence  that the  Proposition \nwas  intended  to  work  such  a radical  change. \nThe  Petition  and alternate  relief sought by  Petitioners  should  be  denied,  and \njudgment  accordingly  should  be  entered.  Respondents  should now promptly prepare  a \nform  of judgment for my  signature. \nOS \nDated:  April  13,  2010  f4 \n Curtis  E.A.

LANGSTON BAR ASSOCIATION \nOF LOS ANGELES; and DOE 1, \n25 \nIntervenors. \n26 \n27 \nRespondents State Bar of California and the Board of Governors of the State Bar (collectively \n28 \n\"State Bar\"), joined by Intervenors,  moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Code of Civil \nSander v. State Bar CPF-08-508880 Order Denying Respondents' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings \n\n1  Procedure section 438.  Petitioners opposed the motion.  The motion came on for hearing on April11, \n2  2016 and appearances are as noted in the record.  Having duly considered the matter, the Court denies the \n3  State Bar's motion. \n4  REQUESTS FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE \n5  As a preliminary matter, the Court rules on Petitioners' requests for judicial notice as follows: \n6  Petitioners' requests for judicial notice of the documents listed as numbers (1) through (15) are \n7  GRANTED pursuant to Evidence Code sections 452, subd. (c), (d), or (h).  See Petitioners' Request for \n8  Judicial Notice in Support of Opposition to Respondents' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (\"RJN\"), \n9  p. 1-2. \n10  Petitioners' requests for judicial notice of the documents listed as numbers (16) through (19) are \n11  DENIED.  \"Letters to individual legislators, including the bill's author, are not matters constituting \n12  cognizable legislative history if they were not communicated to the Legislature as a whole.\"  Cequel III \n13  Communications L LLC v. Local Agency Formation of Comm 'n ofN  evada County (2007) 149 \n14  Cal.App.4th 310,326, n.3; Compare, Borikas v. Alameda Unified School District (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th \n15  135, 154-57 (letters from supporters of the legislation constituted legislative history where Committee \n16  Report on proposed bill discussed the concerns expressed by the supporters).  Here, it does not appear that \n17  the communications between the State Bar and staff members of the Legislature were communicated to \n18  the Legislature as a whole.  Thus, these communications do not constitute proper legislative history, and \n19  are not matters subject to judicial notice.  The Court also rejects Petitioners' argument that the Court \n20  should take judicialJ+otice of the documents numbered 16 through 19 on the grounds they constitute \n21  judicial admissions.  The statements, in and of themselves do not constitute admissions. \n22  I.  BACKGROUND \n23  Petitioners filed a Petition for Writ of Mandate in 2008, seeking to compel the State Bar to provide \n24  them with access to information contained in its bar admissions database, including applicants' bar exam \n25 \nscores, law schools attended, grade point averages, Law School Admissions Test scores, and race, gender \n26 \nor ethnicity information.  The trial court denied the petition.  The California Supreme Court reversed \n27 \nholding that under a common law right of public access, there is sufficient public interest in the \n28 \n2 \nSander v. State Bar CPF-08-508880 Order Denying Respondents' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings \n\n1  information such that the State Bar is required to provide access to it if (1) the information can be \n2 \nprovided in a form that protects the privacy of applicants, and if (2) no countervailing interest outweighs \n3 \nthe public's interest in disclosure.  Sander v. State Bar (\"Sander\") (2013) 58 Cal.4th 300, 304. The case \n4 \nwas remanded to the trial court for further proceedings on these two issues. \n5 \nIn the interim, in 2015, the California Legislature enacted Senate. Bill387 which, among other \n6 \nthings, in section 8, added Business and Professions Code section 6060.25 (hereafter \"section 6060.25\"). \n7 \nThat section reads: \n8 \n9  Notwithstanding any other law, any identifying information submitted by an applicant to \nthe State Bar for admission and a license to practice law and all State Bar admission \n10 \nrecords, including, but not limited to, bar examination scores, law school grade point \naverage (GP A), undergraduate GP A, Law School Admission Test scores, race or ethnicity, \n11 \nand any information contained within the State Bar Admissions database or any file or \n12  other data created by the State Bar with information submitted by the applicant that may \nidentify an individual applicant, shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed pursuant to \n13  any state law, including, but not limited to, the California Public Records Act (Chapter 3.5 \n(commencing with Section 6250) ofDivision 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code). \n14 \nFollowing enactment of section 6060.25, the State Bar filed the instant Motion for Judgment on \n15 \n16  the Pleadings, asserting that section 6060.25 absolutely prohibits the disclosure of the information sought \n17  by Petitioners, and that this Court is no longer permitted to inquire whether the information can be \n18  a \nprovided in an anonymous form, or whether there is  countervailing interest that outweighs the public's \n19 \ninterest in disclosure.  Petitioners do not dispute that section 6060.25 should be applied here.  However, \n20 \nPetitioners contend that section 6060.25 prohibits disclosure only of identifying information submitted by \n21 \nan applicant, or State Bar admission records that may identify an individual applicant.  Opp. p. 2.  In other \n22 \nwords, Petitioners assert that section 6060.25 does not create an absolute bar to the disclosure of the \n23 \n24  information sought in this case. \n25  11.  LEGAL STANDARD \n26 \nCode of Civil Procedure section 4 3 8( c) provides that a motion for judgment on the pleadings may \n27 \nbe brought on the grounds that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. \n28 \n3 \nSander v. State Bar CPF-08-508880 Order Denying Respondents' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings \n\n1  The grounds for a judgment on the pleadings must appear on the face of the complaint or upon matters \n2  judicially noticed. \n3  III.  ANALYSIS \n4  As discussed below, the statutory language and legislative history of section 6060.25 demonstrates \n5  that the statute prohibits disclosure only of identifying information submitted by a bar applicant and all \n6  State Bar admission records that may identify any individual applicant.  Accordingly, the State Bar's \n7  motion is denied and this Court must still apply the test the Supreme Court set forth in Sander to \n8  determine whether the information sought by Petitioners can be produced without disclosing any \n9  identifying information. \n10  A.  The Plain Language of Section 6060.25 Prohibits Disclosure Only of \nIdentifying Information. \n11 \nPetitioners contend that section 6060.25 does not create an absolute prohibition on the disclosure \n12 \nof State Bar admission records because the phrase \"that may identify an individual applicant\" qualifies \n13 \neach of the preceding terms, ther~by precluding the disclosure of the information sought only to the extent \n14 \nsuch information may identify an individual applicant.  The State Bar contends, however, that the same \n15 \nphrase only qualifies the preceding category of records identified in the statute, i.e.\" ... and any \n16 \ninformation contained within the State Bar Admissions database or any file or other data created by the \n17 \nState Bar with information submitted by the applicant,\" and that the remaining categories of State Bar \n18 \nadmissions records, i.e. bar examination scores, law school GP A, undergraduate GP A, LSAT scores, and \n19 \nrace or ethnicity, are absolutely confidential.  For the reasons stated below, the Court agrees with \n20 \nPetitioners. \n21 \nThe \"last antecedent rule\" of statutory construction provides that \"qualifying words, phrases and \n22 \nclauses 'are to be applied to the words or phrases immediately preceding and are not to be construed as \n23 \nextending to or including others more remote.\"  White v. County ofSacramento (1982) 31 Cal.3d 676, 680 \n24 \n25  (citation omitted).  There are two exceptions to the \"last antecedent rule.\"  The first exception provides \n26 \nthat \"when several words are followed by a clause which is applicable as much to the first and other \n27 \nwords as to the last, the natural construction of the language demands that the clause be read as applicable \n28 \nto all.\" Id. (citation omitted).  The second exception provides that \"where the sense of the entire act \n4 \nSander v. State Bar CPF-08-508880 Order Denying Respondents' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings \n\n1  requires that a qualifying word or phrase apply to several preceding words ... [its application] will not be \n2 \nrestricted.\" !d. at 681 (citation omitted). \n3 \nThe Court finds that both exceptions to the \"last antecedent rule\" are applicable in this case.  First, \n4 \nthe phrase \"that may identify an individual applicant\" is equally applicable to all the preceding terms. \n5 \nSecond, the thrust of section 6060.25 is to proscribe disclosure of information or records \"that may \n6 \nidentify an individual applicant,\" and therefore applying such restriction to each of the preceding terms in \n7 \n8  the statute is consistent with the statute's purpose.  The first clause of the statute provides that \"any \n9  identifjdng information submitted by an applicant ... shall be confidential\". · The second clause of the \n10 \nstatute provides that \"any information contained within the state Bar Admissions database or any file or \n1L \nother data created by the State Bar with information submitted by the applicant that may identify an \n12 \nindividual applicant, shall be confidential\".  Thus, both clauses are restricted by precluding disclosure of \n13 \nidentifying information.  Under the State Bar's construction, only the last category of State Bar \n14 \nadmissions records specified in the statute are qualified by the phrase \"that may identify an individual \n15 \n16  applicant.\"  Even if the Court accepted this argument, which it does not, this construction ignores the \n17  initial clause.  Moreover, it makes little sense, to say that these two clauses are meant to qualify the \n18 \nconfidentiality of \"information submitted by an applicant\" and the last category of State Bar admission \n19  . \nrecords, but to not so qualify the confidentiality of the other categories of State Bar admission records that \n20 \nappear in between these two clauses.  Accordingly, the Court finds that a plain reading of the statute \n21 \nreveals that section 6060.25 prohibits disclosure only of identifying information contained in State Bar \n22 \n23  · admission records. \n24  B.  The Legislative History of Section 6060.25 Supports Petitioners' Construction of \nSection 6060.25  · \n25 \nFor the reasons stated below, the Court finds that the legislative history behind section 6060.25 \n26 \nlends further support for Petitioners' construction of the statute. \n27 \n28  First, the legislative history behind section 6060.25 demonstrates a clear intent to increase \n5 \nSander v. State Bar CPF-08-508880 Order Denying Respondents' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings \n\n1  transparency within the State Bar while also protecting applicants' privacy expectations.  Section 6060.25 \n2 \nwas enacted as part of Senate Bill No. 387 (2015-2016 Regular Session) (hereafter \"SB 387\"), which \n3 \nmade the State Bar subject to the California Public Records Act (\"PRA\") and the Bagley-Keene Open \n4 \nMeeting Act, thereby establishing a statutory right of access to records and meetings of the State Bar.  § § \n5 \n6026.7, 6026.11.  As evidenced by language found throughout the bill's legislative history, the purpose of \n6 \nSB 387 is to increase the overall transparency ofthe State Bar.  See Declaration of David Snyder (\"Snyder \n7 \n8  Decl.\"), Exs. 3-15; RJN pp. 4-5.  Under the State Bar's construction, section 6060.25 would completely \n9  prohibit the disclosure of State Bar admission records, regardless of whether their production would \n10 \nviolate applicants' privacy rights or not.  The Court finds that such a construction of the statute is wholly \n11 \ninconsistent with the Legislature's purpose for SB 387.  On the other hand, Petitioner's construction of \n12 \nsection 6060.25 is consistent with both the Legislature's goal of increasing transparency in the State Bar \n13 \nand the need to protect applicants' privacy rights. \n14 \nThe Court rejects the State Bar's argument that the overall legislative intent behind SB 387 is \n15 \n16  irrelevant to this Court's interpretation of section 6060.25.  Under basic rules of statutory construction, \n17  \"the words of the statute should be given their ordinary and usual meaning and should be construed in \n18 \ntheir statutory context.\"  Borikas v. Alameda Unified School District (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 135, 146 \n19 \n(emphasis added).  Thus, the exception created by section 6060.25 must be viewed in light ofthe overall \n20 \npurpose ofSB 387. \n21 \nSecond, the legislative history behind section 6060.25 demonstrates a clear intent to make SB 387 \n22 \nconsistent with the Supreme Court's holding in Sander.  Sander held that Petitioners have a common law \n23 \n24  right of access to the records sought in this case, subject to a balancing test that takes into consideration \n25 \nwhether the information can be provided in a form that protects the privacy of applicants.  Sander, supra, \n26 \n58 Cal.4th at 304.  The bill's Third Reading Floor Analysis states: \n27 \nGiven that the State Bar is already subject to a common law right of access to its records, \n28  subjecting the State Bar to disclosure requirements under PRA should not entail a \nsubstantial change when it comes to balancing individual privacy rights and the public \n6 \nSander v. State Bar CPF-08-508880 Order Denying Respondents' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings \n\n1  interest in disclosure.  The Court in Sander set forth a balancing test between privacy and \npublic access by limiting the right of access to \"de-identified\" records in order to protect \n2 \nthe privacy interest of individual applicants ... Thus, an individual's privacy rights should \nbe at least as protected under the PRA as under the common law's balancing test. \n3 \nSnyder Decl. Ex. 13 (emphasis added).  It is clear from the legislative history materials that \n4 \n5  section 6060.25 was not intended to supersede the balancing test set forth in Sander by making the \n6 \nrecords sought in this case absolutely confidential, as the State Bar contends; rather, it appears that section \n7 \n6060.25, by stating that applicants' privacy rights \"should be at least as protected under the PRA as under \n8 \nthe common law,\" was intended to codify the requirement set forth in Sander that no identifying \n9 \ninformation in State Bar records be disclosed to the public.  Moreover, the Court finds that nothing in \n10 \nsection 6060.25 clearly demonstrates an intent by the Legislature to depart from Sander.  Accordingly, the \n11 \n12  legislative history behind section 6060.25 demonstrates a clear intent by the Legislature to make SB 387 \n13  and section 6060.25 consistent with Sander, and Petitioners' construction of section 6060.25 is consistent \n14 \nwith such intent. \n15 \nIV.  CONCLUSION \n16 \nFor the reasons set forth above, the State Bar's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is denied. \n17 \nBecause both the plain language and legislative history of section 6060.25 suggest that only identifying \n18 \ninformation contained in State Bar admission records are confidential, this Court must still determine \n19 \nwhether the information sought by Petitioners can be produced without disclosing any identifying \n20 \ninformation as set forth by the Supreme Court in Sander. \n21 \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n22 \n23  Dated:  April12, 2016 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n7 \nSander v.

      "text": "MAR  21f 2010 \nCLERK OF THE CURT \nputy Clerk \nSUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA \nCOUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO \nRICHARD SANDER, ET AL.,  CASE NO:  CPF 08-508880 \nPetitioners, \nvs.  PROPOSED STATEMENT OF DECISION \nTHE STATE BAR OF CALIFORNIA, ET \nAL., \nRespondents. \nI  Introduction \nA. \nPetitioners Richard Sander, The California First Amendment Coalition and Joe \nHicks (together \"Sander\") have filed a petition for writ of mandate! seeking data from the \nState Bar of California, which is in turn controlled by respondents the Board of \nGovernors of the State Bar (together \"State Bar\").  The State Bar is an agency of the \njudicial branch. Stipulated Facts For Trial Phase One, filed October 6, 2009 (\"Fact\") 1. \nThe parties agree that the data should be treated as in the possession of the judicial branch \n1 \n.,-,  .. \n\nIII  III  , , \nand are subj ect to disclosure to the extent documents in the possession of the courts must \nbe made publicly available. \nThe data sought pertain to applicants for the state Bar exam, and include the \napplicants' race, law schools attended, year graduated from law school, Bar passage rate, \nand exam scores from their law schools and from the Law School Admissions Test \n(LSA T).  Fact 23.  Sander requested this data from the State Bar and was turned down. \nFact 25. \nThis suit followed. \nB. \nThe parties agreed to, and I ordered, a bifurcated trial. The first phase is based on \nthe pleadings and stipulated facts.  It decides whether Sander has any legal entitlement to \nthe data in the State Bar's database.  Specifically, in this Phase One I am to determine \nwhether data in question is a public record available to any member of the public and \nwhether the provision of the requested data would require the creation of a 'new' record \nwhich, the State Bar contends, need not be created to comply with a public records \nrequest.  If I decide in favor of Sander here, then Phase Two will address privacy and \nburden issues implicated by Sander's request. \nSander's petition is based on (I) the state common law right of access to court \nrecords and (2) Proposition 59, a ballot measure which passed in 2004 endorsing the \npublic's right of access to information and directing access to \"the writings of public \nofficials.\"  Cal. Constit. Art. 1 § 3 (b)(1). \n1 In the alternative Petitioners seek declaratory and injnnctive relief. \n2 \n\nWhile Sander spends some time in his brief describing the research for which \nPetitioners desire the data, their goals, and the asserted public interest and utility of the \ndata sought,2 I agree with the State Bar that these matters are not pertinent because the \npurpose of Sander's request is irrelevant.  City ofS an Jose v. Superior Court, 74 \nCal.AppAth 1008, 1018 (1999).  The only issue here is whether any member of the \npublic, for any reason, has a right to the data sought. \nFollowing my written tentative ruling of March 10, 2010, the parties argued the \ncase on March 19, 2010.  This decision follows. \nII  Common Law Right ofA  ccess \nOur starting point must be NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Superior Court, \n20 Ca1.4th 1178, 1209 (1999).  This case provided the basis for the statewide rules of \ncourt which govern public access to documents filed with the courts.  CRC 2.550 et seq. \n(see accompanying Advisory Committee comments); Mercury Interactive Corp. v. Klein, \n158 Cal.App.4th 60,81,84 (2007).  Based on traditional analyses of First Amendment \nright of access to court proceedings, our Supreme Court noted the now classic distinction \nbetween (i) proceedings and documents related to adjudication3 and (ii) other documents: \nNumerous reviewing courts likewise have found a First Amendment right of \naccess to civil litigation documents filed in court as a basis for adjudication ..... \nSimilarly, in Copley Press, Inc. v. Superior Court (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 106 [7 \nCal.Rptr.2d 841] (Copley Press), the Court of Appeal ruled that the press had a \nright to inspect the clerk's \"rough minute\" books of a California trial court. The \nreviewing court observed that \"in general\" the First Amendment provides \"broad \naccess rights to judicial hearings and records \". both in criminal and civil cases.\" \n(Id., at p. 111.) By contrast, decisions have held that the First Amendment does \n2 E.g., Petitioners' Opening Brief, filed December 7, 2009 at 2-6; 10-12. \n3 To be more precise, traditional access is to documents filed with the court and which become the basis for \nadjudication.  That is the conclusion of the exhaustive analysis of NBC Subsidiary by the Sixth District \nCourt of Appeal. Mercury Interactive Corp. v. Klein, 158 Cal.App.4th 60 et passim (2007). \n3 \n\n!II  ;11'1; \nII \nnot compel public access to discovery materials that are neither used at trial nor \nsubmitted as a basis for adjudication. [Citations] \nNBC Subsidiary, 20 Cal.4th at 1209 n.25. \nA fully integrated part of this scheme is the recognition that the common law or \ntraditional First Amendment right of access cannot and does not extend to a variety of \nitems, such as grand jury transcripts, judges' private deliberations and conferences, \npreliminary drafts of orders, and the like.  Id, 20 Cal.4th at 1212 n.29.  See also, Copley \nPress, Inc. v. Superior Court, 6 Cal.App.4th 106, 114 (l992)(no disclosure of \n\"preliminary drafts, personal notes and rough records\"); People v. Dixon, 148 \nCal.App.4th 414,424 et seq. (2007)(variety of proceedings and documents not open to \npublic).  The California Supreme Court has reaffirmed the scope of the traditional right of \naccess: \n[Our] decisions ... have been careful not to extend the public's right of access \nbeyond the adjudicative proceedings and filed documents of trial and appellate \ncourts. \nCopley Press, Inc. v. Superior Court, 39 Cal.4th 1272, 1303 (2006)( emphasis in \noriginal)(noting congruence with U.S. Supreme Court analyses). \nThe issue then devolves to whether the data requested by Sander fall within the \nscope of documents in the possession of the judicial branch traditionally subject to public \ndisclosure.  They plainly do not.  None of the data at issue is presented to a court and \n4 \nnone ever is used in any form of adjudicatory proceeding, even within the confines of the \nState Bar with respect, for example, to how any applicant is processed. That is, even were \nI to expand the notion of' adjudication' to reach the work of the State Bar in evaluating \nits applicants, the data sought by Sander would not qualify. \n4 \n\nIII  Judicial Records \nA. \nAnother series of cases requires review.  Both sides cite Pantos v.  City and \nCounty ofS an Francisco, 151 Cal.App.3d 258,262 (1984) in support of their respective \npositions.  Sander argues that it establishes a far more general right to documents than the \n'adjudicatory' records I refer to above: \nThe law favors maximum public access to judicial proceedings and court records. \n(See Press-Enterprise Company v. Superior Court (1984) 501 U.S. 464 [ ... ]; \nGlobe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court (1982) 457 U.S. 596, 604-605 [ ... ]. \nIudicial records are historically and presumptively open to the public and there is \nan important right of access which should not be closed except for compelling \ncountervailing reasons. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1904.) No such reasons have been \npresented. \nPantos, 151 Cal.App.3d at 262-263. \nSander cites other cases to the same effect, that is, court records are public \nrecords, Estate ofH  earst, 67 Cal.App.3d 777, 782 (1977), and unless there is a \ncountervailing policy reason (such as privacy), the records must be disclosed.  See \nSander's Opening Brief at 24 et seq.  Sander cites Copley to the same effect. \"Court \nrecords are public records open to inspection.\"  Copley Press, Inc. v. Superior Court, 6 \nCal.App.4th 106, 112 (1992). \nBut the foci in all these cases are 'judicial records' as defined by C.C.P. § 1904, \nand the preliminary enquiry must be whether the documents sought so qualify.  E.g., \nCopley, 6 Cal.App.4th at 112.  That is, this entirely general right of access is limited to \njudicial records.  While Copley's discussion reveals the sometimes difficult business of \ndistinguishing some clerks' records from others, it is essential not to lose sight of the \n4 As Sander notes, the parties here agree that the records sought are \"non-adjudicatory.\" Petitioners' Reply \n5 \n\n, r \nunderlying definition of judicial records as \"the record or official entry of the proceedings \nin a court of justice, or of the official act of a judicial officer, in an action or special \nproceeding.\"  C.C.P. § 1904.  The fact that Copley, Pantos, and other cases paint with a \nbroad brush-broader than NBC Subsidiary's references to adjudicatory documents-is \nof no consequence outside the bounded universe of \"judicial records\" and does not, as \nSander argues, provide authority for the general release of all non-adj udicatory \ndocuments.  Sander's Opening Brief at 25.5  And, of course, a review of the definition of \n'judicial records' shows that the data sought by Sander cannot possibly qualify. \nCompare, Copley, 6 Cal.App.4'h at 113 Gudicial records represent and reflect work of the \ncourts). \nB. \nAt argument Sander objected to the schema outlined above.  Sander disclaims \nreliance on NBC Subsidiary, dubbing it a constitutional approach which concededly does \nnot authorize the release of the contested data.  Sander instead relies on what he \ndistinguishes as the common law right of access, which pre-dates the constitntional rule, \nassertedly exemplified by cases such as Copley and Pantos but which is not limited to the \nscope of 'judicial records' or 'adjudicatory' records. \nThe cited case law does not support Sander.  Pantos, for example, in fact focuses \non \"judicial records,\" rests on the logic of open judicial proceedings, and is \nto Respondents' Phase I Trial Brief, filed February 16,2010 at 18. \n, Sander notes that Mack v. State Bar a/California, 92 Cal.AppAth 957, 962-963 (2001) authorizes the \nrelease of data which is plainly not a judicial record but, Sander argues, nevertheless compelled by \ntraditional First Amendment principles. Mack does assume the state bar disciplinary records there are \n'public records' and then invokes the strong policies which favor disclosure.  But the reason those \nparticular State Bar documents were public records was because Business of Professions Code § 6086.1 \nsaid so.  Mack, 92 Cal.AppAth at 961.  Sander does not argue that § 6086.1 applies here. \n6 \n\nfundamentally premised on the rationale of Press-Enterprise Company v. Superior \nCourt,  464 U.S. 501 (1984).  Pantos, 151 Cal.App.3d at 262 -263.  Press-Enterprise, in \nturn, makes it plain both that (i) the common law history6 of open trials focuses on the \nadjudicatory business of courts, and (ii) it is this tradition which informs the scope ofthe \nFirst Amendment.  Press-Enterprise Co., 464 U.S. 501, 509 n.8.  Precisely the same \nhistorical analysis of the common law had been used to describe the import of the First \nAmendment in Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v.  Virginia,  448 U.s. 555, 564-565 (1980). \nThe Supreme Court is clear that \"right of access is embodied in the First Amendment, \nand applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.\" Globe Newspaper Co. v. \nSuperior Court for Norfolk County, 457 U.S. 596, 603 (1982).7  See generally, D. Schulz \net aI., \"2009 Update: Developments In The Law Of, Access,\" Communications Law in \nthe Digital Age 2009 988 PLIlPat 345 (PLI 2009)( constitutional and common law right \nof access). \nFinally, NBC Subsidiary itself-the case on which Sander now disclaims \nreliance-relies on and treats Copley as an example of the First Amendment right to \naccess to judicial records.  NBC Subsidiary, 20 Cal.4th at 1209 n.25.  Sander's attempt to \nrely on Copley and avoid the logic of NBC Subsidiary must fail. \nC. \nSander may mean to suggest that the common law contemplates not only the \nrelease of judicial records, but also 'public records' generally.  This is so.  Nixon v. \n6 The Supreme Court takes us back to before the Norman Conquest of 1066.  464 U.S. at 505 n.1. \n7 Earlier, the Supreme Court in Nixon v. Warner Communications, 435 U.S. 589 (1978) noted a 'common \nlaw' right to access \"public\" documents including judicial records.  435 U.S. at 597 & n.8.  The cases cited \n7 \n\n, I \nWarner Communications, 435 U.S. 589, 598 nn.7 & 8.  There, the Court cited a series of \ncases which recognize the connnon law right entirely apart from its impact on the courts. \nMost of these cited cases8 simply assume that the records are 'public' and so by default \nought to be disclosed.  This does not help us here, because neither Nixon nor any other \n9 \ncase nor argument presented by Sander provides criteria by which I can determine \nwhether the data sought in this case are 'public' records-except, as noted below in \nconnection with Proposition 59, criteria which are so broad as to be self-defeating. \nUltimately, Sander does not provide a coherent description of the connnon law \nscope of 'public records' which would authorize the relief he seeks here.  Indeed, the \nauthority he seeks from that history is likely unavailable: the connnon law even after its \narrival on these shores was restrictive, generally authorizing release of documents only to \nthose with a e.g., pecuniary interest.  See, e.g., cases discussed in State v. Grimes, 84 P. \n1061,1072 (Nev. 1906)(Grimes is cited in Nixon, 435 U.S. at 598 n.8 as one the key \ncases exemplifying the nonjudicial records common law right of access).  So too, \ndissatisfaction with the miserly scope of common law access likely was a central reason \nfor Legislative action in enacting, for example, the California Public Records Act and its \nfederal counterpart, the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U. S. C. § 552 (ForA) \"enacted to \nfacilitate public access to Government documents,\" US. Dep't a/State v.  Ray, 502 U.S. \nby the Court in that footnote all exemplifY access to judicial records, that is, those fanning the basis for \nadjudication. \nS The exceptions are Fayette County v. Martin, 279 Ky. 387, 395-396,130 S.W.2d 838, 843 (1939)(state \nstatute bars release, superseding common law); State ex rei. NlNada Title Guaranty & Trust Co. v. Grimes, \n29 Nev. 50, 82-86, 84 P. 1061, 1072-1074 (l906)(some records public, some are not).  435 U.S. at 598 n.7 \n9 Sander's argument on non-judicial common law access confuSingly relies on cases which address judicial \nrecords.  Petitioner's Opening Brief at 24 et seq.; Reply Brief at 6 et seq.  But these, as noted above, \ncomprise a limited set of document not at issue here.  Too, Sander relies on cases such as Richmond \nNewspapers, supra, to establish this more general common law right of access, despite the fact that those \ncases are peculiarly focused on the common law foundation of the constitutional right to open trials and \ncourt documents; again, not at issue here.  Petitioners' Reply Brief at 8 et seq., citing Richmond \nNewspapers, NBC Subsidiary, Nixon, etc. \n8 \n\n164, 173 (1991).  See e.g., BRV, Inc. v. Superior Court,  143 Cal.App.4th 742,750 \n(2006)(CPRA enacted in order \"to give the public access to information in possession of \npublic agencies\").  Indeed, it is clear that \"the CPRA was enacted for the purpose of \nincreasing freedom of information by giving members of the public access to information \nin the possession of public agencies,\" County a/Santa Clara v. Superior Court,  170 \nCal.App.4th 1301, 1319 (2009)(internal quotes omitted and emphasis supplied).  In short, \nwere non-judicial records common law rights of access as broad as claimed by Sander, \nthere would have been little need for the FOIA or CPRA. \nThus, while the common law rule by definition pre-dates the adoption of the \nconstitutional requirement, here there is no useful distinction between the two. \nIV  Proposition 59 \nSander argues that Proposition 59, passed by the voters in 2004, provides an \nindependent basis for the release of the data he seeks.  But Proposition 59 did not change \nthe substantive law.  As the Court of Appeal has repeated, \"Proposition 59 is simply a \nconstitutionalization of the CPRA [California Public Records Act].,,10 \nIt is true that court records are not covered by the CPRA in any event.  Copley \nPress, Inc. v. Superior Court, 6 Cal.App.4th 106, III (1992).  Access to court records, \nrather, has traditionally been a function oflong standing common law and First \nAmendment interests such as those discussed above. \n10 Suiter's Place v. Superior Court, 161 Cal.AppAth 1370, 1382 (2008), citing, BRV, Inc. v. Superior Court, \n143 Cal.AppAth 742, 749 (2006). See also, Savaglio v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 149 Cal.AppAth 588, 597-\n598 (2007); Los Angeles Unified School Dist. v. Superior Court, 151 Cal.AppAth 759 (2007). \n9 \n\nThus the issue may be reframed whether Proposition 59, which did not modify the \nCPRA (a statute), nevertheless did modify traditional constitutional tests including for \nexample Article I § 2 of our state Constitution which underlies the traditional test. I I \nSander urges Proposition 59 as an independent basis for the data sought, arguing \nthat it covers every writing without exception,12 regardless of whether a public official \nwrote it or simply possessed it.  Sander Opening Brief at 21.  Every document in the \npossession of the courts must be open to public access.13  This is a stunning shift from \nwhat I have termed the traditional test.  Sander provides no evidence that the voters \nmeant the Proposition to have such a remarkable reach in modifying the state \nConstitution and decades oflegal development.  The evidence of voter intent submitted \nby Sander, 14 too, is consistent with no more than the constitutionalization of extant \nrightsY \nNor does the plain language of the Proposition support Sander's reading.  The \nProposition prescribes \"public scrutiny\" of (1) \"meetings of public bodies\" and (2) \n\"writings of public officials.\" Cal. Constit. Art. 1 § 3(b)(I).  On its face, this does not \nsuggest the mandatory disclosure of documents aside from judicial records nor of the data \nsought by Sander (which is not even the writing of a public official but rather data \ncollected from applicants).  As the State Bar intimates, if Proposition 59 truly expanded \nthe universe of documents to be disclosed to all papers in the possession of the \ngovernment, parts of the Proposition which govern the construction of extant law on \n11 This is California's 'free speech' provision, analogous to the federal First Amendment. \n12 That is, anything that the Evidence Code considers to be a writing. Sander's Opening Brief at 20. \n\"The requested records are unquestionably writings of a public agency. They relate to the conduct of the \n]3 \npeople's business. They are, therefore, subject to the right of access created by Proposition 59 .....\"  Sander \nOpening Brief at 23. \n14 Sander's Opening Brief at 17-18; 19-20. \n10 \n\ndisclosure would be at best surplusage. See e.g., Cal. Constit. Art. I § 3(b)(2) & (3). \nFinally, the wording of the Proposition itself confirms the applicability of extant law-\nand by that I mean more than simply statutory law such as the CPRA, but also other \n\"authority\" which I take to mean the constitutional common law discussed above: \nA statute, court rule, or other authority, including those in effect on the effective \ndate ofthis subdivision, shall be broadly construed if it furthers the people's right \nof access, and narrowly construed if it limits the right of access. \nCal. Const. Art. 1 § 3 (a)(2)(emphasis supplied). \nThe Courts have, in fact, usually executed this mandate to broadly construe the \npeople's right of access.  The Court did so in, for example, NBC Subsidiary back in 1999 \nlong before Proposition 59.  20 Cal.4th at 1212 -1213. \nAt argument, Sander pressed an additional 'plain language' contention.  He notes \nthat Proposition 59 itself carves out the areas of existing law which are preserved, and by \nimplication other areas are not.  Cal. Constit. Art. 1 § 3(3)_(6).16  These provisions, in \norder, preserve law on privacy, constitutional and statutory bases, and legislative \nconfidentiality.  All documents not covered by such exemptions - presumably \nexemptions described only in case law (aside from those related to privacy)-must be \ndisclosed.  This obliterates centuries of common law analyses.  Whatever the other merits \nof this contention (and it contradicts Sutter's Place, supra note 10), it must rely, at least, \non a clear and precise distinction between the constitutional and common law analyses \nwhich, for reasons stated above, is not available. \n15 Indeed, much of Sander's argument on the import of Proposition 59 is based on the meaning of similar \nterms in pre-existing statutes.  Sander Opening Brief at e.g., 21. \n16 Sander's argument here of implicit repeal-that is, that Proposition 59 creates new law entitling him to \nthe data sought in this case--impliedly concedes that he is not entitled to the data under traditional common \nlaw or First Amendment tests. \n11 \n\nAs a commentator has noted, the Proposition states policy, but does not create a \nspecific right: \nBut with the arguable exception of a subdivision affirmatively shielding the \nlegislature from sunshine laws, the amendment is largely a policy statement and a \npositioning of the newly declared access right relative to other constitutional \nrights, rather than a guarantee of particular rights and responsibilities. Those tasks \nare left to existing open-government legislation.17 \nIn the end, Sander's argument proves too much.  If Proposition 59 were an \nindependent basis for disclosure, eviscerating traditional cornmon law first amendment \nanalyses and requiring the production of every document in the hands of the judicial \nbranch-and that is Sander's argument here, supra notes 12-13-then judges' rough \nnotes and other internal documents, which under traditional law are not to be disclosed \n(Copley Press, 6 Cal.App.4tl1 at 114-115) would be open for public inspection.  So too \ngrand jury transcripts would have to be disclosed-but they are not: \nThe amendments under Proposition 59 do not affect our interpretation of section \n938.1. Article I, section 3, subdivision (b)(5) of the California Constitution, \nprovides, \"This subdivision does not repeal or nullify, expressly or by implication, \nany constitutional or statutory exception to the right of access to public records or \nmeetings of public bodies that is in effect on the effective date of this \nsubdivision .... \" \nAlvarez v. Superior Court, 154 Cal.App.4th 642,657 (2007).  See also Mercury \nInteractive Corp. v. Klein, 158 Cal.App.4th 60,101 (2007)(Proposition 59 as a \nrule of construction). \nFor this reason, Alvarez rejected the argument that Proposition 59 had gutted \nearlier traditional cornmon law on the right of access to grand jury transcripts.  Indeed, I \n17  Karen Petroski, \"Lessons For Academic Freedom Law: The California Approach To University \nAutonomy And Accountability,\" 32 J.C. & U.L. 149,203-04 (2005). \n12 \n\nhave found no case that supports the notion that Proposition 59 overturns former law on \ndisclosure of documents; quite the contrary.18 \nV.  California Rule ofC  ourt 10.500 \nFollowing the opening salvo of briefs in this case the Judicial Council enacted \nCRC 10.500 which requires the judicial branch to  allow inspection and copying of \njudicial records.  Thus, I invited the parties to comment on the applicability of this Rule \nto the present dispute, Order of January 25,2010, and both sides have done so.  As the \nState Bar notes, the Rule itself states that it applies solely to the courts (as well as the \nAdministrative Office of the Courts), CRC 1O.500(c)(3).  The Council expressly \n19 \nconsidered and rejected efforts to expand the Rule's coverage to the State Bar.\nSander argues that I should nevertheless supersede the Judicial Council's view of \nthe scope of its Rule and more broadly construe it, in conformity with the legislation \nwhich originally directed the Council to enact the Rule.  Petitioners' Reply to \nRespondents' Phase I Trial Brief, filed February 16,2010, at 19-20. \nIt is a heady suggestion, but I must decline.  First, the enabling legislation does \nnot instruct the Council to enact rules governing the State Bar.  Govt. C. § 68016.2. \nSecond, even if the legislation did contain the mandate, there is no authority permitting a \ntrial court effectively to bypass the procedures of the Judicial Council (including its use \nof committees, votes by the Council proper, and public comment process), and enact a \nrule of court which the court believes is required by enabling legislation.  It would be a \n18 Compare cases cited supra n.1 o. \n19 Report Summary and Report, Request for Judicial Notice in Support of Respondents' Phase I Sur-Reply, \nEtc., filed on or about February 22, 2010, at 91. This includes documents prepared in conjunction with the \n13 \n\nvery odd situation indeed if trial courts had that authority.  Where a rule of court conflicts \nwith superseding law, such as legislation, the remedy is to invalidate the rule, not re-write \nit.  E.g., California Court Reporters Assn. v. Judicial Council o/California,  39 \nCal.AppAth 15,33-34 (1995).  See generally, Elkins v. Superior Court, 41 Cal.4th 1337, \n1352 (2007)(invalidation of rules when inconsistent with superseding authority).  Of \ncourse, Sander does not ask me to invalidate the Rule, nor would doing so provide him \nthe relief he seeks. \nVI  Production 0/ Records \nThis first phase of the trial contemplates my evaluation of the extent to which \nPetitioners are seeking the production of 'new' records, because if I hold that this is so, \nthen I may find for the State Bar in any event. \nI do not reach a decision on the matter here for two reasons. First, given my \nconclusions above, I need not reach it.  Second, as discussed below the record is \ninsufficient. \nI note that the parties do not, exactly, disagree that 'new' records need not be created \nby the State Bar. 20  Nor do the parties disagree that the State Bar has in its possession all \nthe data sought by the Petitioners.  The crux of the dispute is the extent to which data in \nelectronic records, which must be massaged to some extent for production, thereby \nbecome 'new' records.  See e.g., Petitioners' Reply to Respondents' Phase I Brief at 26 & \nCouncil public comment process. Petitioners' request for judicial notice of the document, dated February \n22, 20 I 0, is granted. \n20 Nevertheless the parties were unable to cite California authority on the issue whether public agencies \nhave a duty to create 'new' record from the data available.  Petitioners instead rely on for example \nconstructions offederal and others states' public disclosure statutes.  E.g., N L. R. R. v. Sears, Roebuck & \nCo., 421 U.S. 132, 162 (1975)(construing federal Freedom ofInformation Act); State ex rei. Kerner v. State \nTeachers Retirement Rd., 82 Ohio St.3d 273,274,695 N.E.2d 256,258 (Ohio,1998). \n14 \n\nn.9.  As Sander notes, in other contexts it is understood that a governmental agency, or \nindeed any producing party, may need to engage in some such programming?!  See \ngenerally, County ofS anta Clara v. Superior Court, 170 Cal.App.4th 1301, 1336, citing \nGovt. C. § 6253.9(b).  See e.g., Schladetsch v.  US. Dept ofH UD., 2000 WL 33372125, \n3 (D.D.C. 2000).  In the context of digital data, it does not make much sense to consider \nsimply whether a document demand requires the creation of a 'new' document since \nevery production of electronically stored data literally creates a 'new' document on \nscreen, on paper, or in a 'new' digital file.22  In some contexts, merely transforming a \ndocument from one electronic format into another might be treated as the creation of a \n'new' document.  E.g., Hagenbuch v. 3B6 Sistemi Elettronici Industriali S.R.L., 2006 WL \n665005, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 8,2006).  In other contexts, it is routine to direct the \ncompilation of extant data, e.g., Person v. Farmers Ins. Group ofC  ompanies, 52 \nCal.App.4th 813,818 (1997), including the use of queries to a database.  E.g., Jinks-\nUmsteadv. England, 227 F.R.D. 143, 148 (D.D.C. 2005). \nThe very notion of what comprises a digital 'document' depends on a variety of \nfactors, for a 'document' mayor may include, for example, metadata, drafts, attachments, \nand data otherwise \"pointed to\" and in effect incorporated into a file.  As the Sedona \nConference has noted, the data at stake here is \"Dynamic and Changeable\": \nComputer information, unlike paper, has content that is designed to change over \ntime even without human intervention. Examples include: workflow systems that \nautomatically update files and transfer data from one location to another; backup \napplications that move data from one storage area to another to function properly; web \npages that are constantly updated with information fed from other applications; and \n\"Programming\" in this lay sense generally includes any fonn of provision of instructions to a computer, \n21 \nincluding the creation of a report fonn by which data is assembled for viewing.  See generally, \nhttp://www.wordreference.com/defmitionlprogramming. \n22 Typically data stored in databases are contained in fields, which are then collected on a as-needed basis \npursuant to varying criteria to create a report.  E.g., http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.comldatabase \n15 \n\nemail systems that reorganize and purge data automatically. As a result, unlike paper \ndocuments, much electronically stored information is not fixed in a final form. \nMore generally, electronically stored information is more easily and more \nthoroughly changeable than paper documents. Electronically stored information can be \nmodified in numerous ways that are sometimes difficult to detect without computer \nforensic techniques. Moreover, the act of merely accessing or moving electronic data \ncan change it. For example, booting up a computer may alter data contained on it. \nSimply moving a word processing file from one location to another may change \ncreation or modification dates found in the metadata?3 \nWhether a production involves the creation of a 'new' document likely implicates \nspectra of (i) efforts in making the production and (ii) relationship between extant data \nand that demanded.  At one end, the wholesale substitution of one kind of data for \nanother may be so close to the creation of a substantively new record that it should not be \nordered, as Respondents suggest.  Respondents' Phase One Trial Brief at, e.g., 23.  And \nat the other end of a spectrum the level of 'manipulation' may be no more than creating a \nsimple form identifying which extant data to print out, 'redacting' (or not selecting) other \ndata.  E.g., Petitioners' Reply to Respondents' Phase I Trial Brief at e.g., 22.24  See \ngenerally, Lisa M. Arent, et aI., \"Ediscovery: Preserving, Requesting & Producing \nElectronic Information,\" 19 SANTA CLARA COMPUTER & HIGH TECH. L.J. 131, 156 et seq. \n(2002). \nFundamentally the issue is likely to devolve to the complexity of the tasks \ninvolved in generating the reports sought by Petitioners.  Diagrams of the steps involved \n(Respondents' Phase One Trial Brief at 25) are not entirely useful in this regard.  It \n23 http://www.thesedonaconference.orgldltForm?did=TSC]RINCP _2nd_ ed _6 07.pdf at 3. \nIn analogous discovery contexts, courts understand that databases may need to be queried to produce \n24 \nselected series of data.  E.g., Powerhouse Marks, L.L. C. v. Chi Hsin Impex, Inc., 2006 WL 83477 (E.D. \nMich. Jan. 12,2006). I recognize that CRC 10.500(e)(I)(B) provides where that Rule controls, no new \ncompilation or assemblage of data need be undertaken.  But to date I have not seen any authority that \nsuggests Respondents are correct I should follow this Rule here, and indeed in a different context \n16 \n\nappears that the relational database maintained by the State Bar (Fact 26) includes the \ndata sought by Sander (Facts 28 et seq.), and thus it is likely that a query can be \nformulated to extract the data sought. 25  But without expert declarations on the matter, \nwhich do not beg the question of the extent to which 'new' data or its arrangement are \ninvolved, this issue is not ripe for adjudication. \nVII  Evidentiary objections \nNone ofthe items subject to evidentiary dispute is material to the discussions \nabove.  The items are thus not relevant, and I need not rule on the related evidentiary \nobjections. \nVIII.  Conclusion \nPetitioners both rely on the common law and on Proposition 59's asserted \nevisceration of the common law.  In both cases, Petitioners' contentions reduce to the \nassertion that they are entitled to 'public documents,' but they are unable to articulate a \nprincipled definition of the notion save and except an overbroad defmition that includes \nall information in the possession of a public agency.  The law applicable to the courts \nbefore Proposition 59 was not that broad; and there is no evidence that the Proposition \nwas intended to work such a radical change. \nRespondents urge I not follow it.

Ct. No. CPF08508880) \n  Defendants and Respondents. \n \n \n  Appellants Richard Sander, Joe Hicks and the California First Amendment \nCoalition  seek access to admissions records from the State Bar of California (the Bar), \nsubject to conditions designed to ensure the privacy of bar applicants, in order to conduct \nacademic research on discrepancies in bar passage rates among racial and ethnic groups.  \nAfter the Bar rejected Sander‟s request, appellants filed this action for a writ of mandate \nto compel the Bar to release the information.  The trial court concluded that the common \nlaw right of access to public documents is no broader than the right of access to \nadjudicatory court records based in the First Amendment to the United States \nConstitution and, therefore, does not authorize public access to the Bar‟s records sought \nby appellants.  The court further found article I, section 3(b) of the California \nConstitution inapplicable to the records request. \n  We hold this analysis was erroneous.  The common law right of access to public \ndocuments is broader than the First Amendment right of access to adjudicatory court \ndocuments.  We therefore reverse the judgment and remand the case to the superior court \nto determine whether the Bar must produce the requested information after balancing the \n  1 \n\napplicants‟ interest in confidentiality and the burden this request imposes on the Bar \nagainst the strong public policy favoring disclosure.  The trial court is best suited to craft \nany qualifications to an order for production that can accommodate these concerns if \npossible. \nBACKGROUND \n  The Bar collects and maintains records containing information regarding \nindividuals who apply to take the bar exam.  In addition to bar exam results and scores, \nthe information pertaining to each individual often includes the applicant‟s undergraduate \nand law school records, standardized test scores, ethnic background, and gender.  \n  Sander, an economist and professor of law at the University of California Los \nAngeles, conducts research on the scale and effects of admissions preferences in higher \neducation.  Sander approached the Bar to explore possible collaboration on research \nregarding a large and persistent gap in bar exam passage rates among racial and ethnic \ngroups.  The Bar rejected his proposal based, in part, on concerns about applicants‟ \ninterests in the confidentiality of their personal information.  \n  Sander then made a formal request for the records he needed to conduct his study.  \nThe Bar rejected his request, again citing privacy concerns, and subsequently rejected a \nrevised request.  The California First Amendment Coalition, a nonprofit corporation \nprimarily concerned with open government issues, filed a separate request for the same \ndata.  That request was also rejected. \n  Appellants petitioned the San Francisco Superior Court for a writ of mandate to \ncompel the Bar to disclose the requested records pursuant to the common law right of \naccess to public records and article I, section 3(b) of the California Constitution (enacted \ninto law in 2004 by the passage of Proposition 59).1  The parties stipulated to bifurcate \nthe proceedings into two phases.  Phase One addressed whether the Bar has a legal duty \n                                              \n  1  Hereinafter “Proposition 59.” \n  2 \n\nto provide the requested records and encompassed four sub-issues:  “(a) Whether there is \na public right of access to the requested records; [¶] (b) Whether providing the requested \nrecords in accordance with the protocols accompanying Petitioners‟ requests would entail \nthe creation of a „new record‟; [¶] (c) Whether the right of public access requires the \ncreation of a „new record‟ or, in other words, whether the need to create a record relieves \nRespondents of the duty to provide access to the requested records; and [¶] (d) Whether \nthe Court can order Respondents to provide the requested records in a manner other than \nthat specified in the protocols accompanying Petitioners‟ requests.”   \n  Phase Two was to proceed only if the court found the Bar subject to a duty of \ndisclosure, and was to address whether providing the records to petitioners would violate \nBar applicants‟ privacy rights or impose an undue burden on the Bar that would justify \nlimiting or denying Sander‟s request.   \n  Phase One was tried on declarations and stipulated facts.  The court ruled that \nneither constitutional principles nor the common law imposes a legal duty on the Bar to \nprovide access to its records.  The court looked first to the presumptive right of access to \ncourt documents that is grounded in the First Amendment right to open trials, exploring \nthe distinction within that category between “adjudicatory” documents (i.e., official \ndocuments reflecting the work of the court), which are generally subject to public access, \nand others, such as preliminary drafts, personal notes and rough records, which are \ngenerally not.  The court ruled that because the Bar‟s admission records are not \nadjudicatory, Sander has no right of access to them under the First Amendment.   \n  The court also rejected Sander‟s position that the records are subject to a \npresumptive right of disclosure under the common law right of access to public records.  \nIn rejecting the common law right, the court reasoned:  “[T]he foci in all these cases [on \nthe common law right of access] are „judicial records‟ as defined by C.C.P. § 1904, and \nthe preliminary enquiry must be whether the documents sought so qualify.  E.g., Copley, \n6 Cal.App.4th at 112.  That is, this entirely general right of access is limited to judicial \n  3 \n\nrecords.”  Although the trial court recognized that the historic origins of the common law \npresumptive right of access to public documents predates the rule of access to court \ndocuments derived from the First Amendment, it concluded the common law right “has \nin effect been absorbed by the constitutional rule.”   \n  The court also declined to apply the common law presumptive right for another \nreason:  a perceived lack of criteria governing its application.  The court reasoned that \nmost of the cases Sander cited in support of disclosure “simply assume that the records \nare „public‟ and so by default ought to be disclosed.  This does not help us here, because \n[neither the case authority] nor argument presented by Sander provides criteria by which \nI can determine whether the data sought in this case are „public‟ records—except, as \nnoted below in connection with Proposition 59, criteria which are so broad as to be self-\ndefeating. [¶] Ultimately, Sander does not provide a coherent description of the common \nlaw scope of „public records‟ which would authorize the relief he seeks here.”   \n  Finally, the court rejected Sander‟s position that Proposition 59 authorizes access \nto the Bar records.  Proposition 59 provides that “[t]he people have the right of access to \ninformation concerning the conduct of the people‟s business, and therefore, the meetings \nof public bodies and the writings of public officials and agencies shall be open to public \nscrutiny.”  The court found that both its language and history demonstrate only the \nintention to constitutionalize, but not expand, existing law.2   \n  In light of its rejection of Sander‟s request, the court declined to address whether \nor to what extent granting the petition would require the production of “new” records.  \nThe court found the record was insufficient to resolve this issue.  It noted:  “Whether a \nproduction involves the creation of a „new‟ document likely implicates spectra of (i) \nefforts in making the production and (ii) relationship between extant data and that \n                                              \n  2  The court also found that rule 10.500 of the California Rules of Court is \ninapplicable to Bar records.  Sander does not dispute this conclusion.  \n  4 \n\ndemanded. . . . [¶] Fundamentally, the issue is likely to devolve to the complexity of the \ntasks involved in generating the reports sought by Petitioners.  Diagrams of the steps \ninvolved [citation] are not entirely useful in this regard.  It appears that the relational \ndatabase maintained by the State Bar [citation] includes the data sought by Sander \n[citation], and thus it is likely that a query can be formulated to extract the data sought.  \nBut without expert declarations on the matter, which do not beg the question of the extent \nto which „new‟ data or its arrangement are involved, this issue is not ripe for \nadjudication.”   \n  The court excluded portions of petitioners‟ supporting declarations as irrelevant, \napparently due to its conclusion that there is no public right of access to the Bar‟s \nrecords.  “Whether the Bar has or has not previously released in [sic] information \n(Murphy Declaration), the reasons for Sander‟s work and his hypotheses (Sander \nDeclaration), what various agency‟s practices are (LeClere Declaration), the Bar related \ncorrespondence proffered via the Chadwick Declaration, and the balance of the objected \nto evidence, are all irrelevant to the issue decided in the [statement of decision].”   \n  Sander timely appealed from the ensuing judgment.   \nDISCUSSION \n  Sander asserts the public has a qualified right of access to the Bar‟s applicant \nrecords derived from two independent sources:  the common law and Proposition 59.  \nSince we should refrain from deciding an issue on constitutional grounds if it can be \ndecided on a nonconstitutional basis (see NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Superior \nCourt (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178, 1190), we will first address Sander‟s contention that the \ncourt erred when it found the Bar‟s records were not subject to disclosure under the \ncommon law presumption of access to public documents.  We agree that the court erred. \nA.  The Common Law Right of Access is Not Limited to Official Court Records \n  The common law right of access to public documents originated long before, and \nindependently of, the right of access to adjudicatory records grounded in the First \n  5 \n\nAmendment.  (United States v. Mitchell (D.C. Cir. 1976) 551 F.2d 1252, 1257-1259; \nPolillo v. Deane (1977) 74 N.J. 562, 570 [tracing common law rule to English law dating \nback to first half of the 18th century].)  As stated in Polillo, the policies underlying the \ncommon law right are deeply rooted in our democratic form of government.  “The policy \nreasons for opening up government to the public have been expressed on numerous \noccasions throughout this nation‟s history.  Foremost among them is the goal of fulfilling \nour cherished ideal of creating a „government of the people.‟  James Madison wrote:  „A \npopular Government without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a \nPrologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or perhaps both.  Knowledge will forever govern \nignorance: And a people who mean to be their own Governors, must arm themselves with \nthe power which knowledge gives.‟  [Citations.]  DeTocqueville felt that these same ideas \nwere fundamental to the American tradition.  In his perceptive commentaries about our \nsystem of government, he observed:  „It is by taking a share in legislation that the \nAmerican learns to know the law; it is by governing that he becomes educated about the \nformalities of government.  The great work of society is daily performed before his eyes, \nand so to say, under his hands.‟  ”  (Polillo, supra,74 N.J. at pp. 570-571.) \n  Similar sentiments are found in our state‟s legislative expressions of public \npolicy as far back as 1953.  In enacting the Brown Act, our state‟s open meeting law, “the \nLegislature finds and declares that the public commissions, boards and councils and the \nother public agencies in this State exist to aid in the conduct of the people‟s business.  It \nis the intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be \nconducted openly. [¶] The people of this State do not yield their sovereignty to the \nagencies which serve them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public \nservants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for \nthem to know.  The people insist on remaining informed so that they may retain control \nover the instruments they have created.”  (Gov. Code, § 54950.)  This expression of \npolicy is repeated in the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act and its sentiment is captured in \nthe Public Records Act, which has been interpreted to embody the strong public policy in \n  6 \n\nfavor of disclosure of public records.  (Gov. Code, §§ 11120 & 6250; Bernardi v. County \nof Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1392.)3   \n  Justice Powell echoed these expressions of the importance of open government in \nNixon v. Warner Communications, Inc. (1978) 435 U.S. 589 (Nixon), concerning media \nclaims for access to the infamous Whitehouse tapes.  Writing for the court, he addressed \nthe scope of the common law right of access to public information—an “infrequent \nsubject of litigation, [whose] contours have not been delineated with any precision.”  (Id. \nat p. 597.)  He wrote, “[i]t is clear that the courts of this country recognize a general \nright to inspect and copy public records and documents, including judicial records and \ndocuments.  In contrast to the English practice, [citation], American decisions generally \ndo not condition enforcement of this right on a proprietary interest in the document or \nupon a need for it as evidence in a lawsuit.  The interest necessary to support the issuance \nof a writ compelling access has been found, for example, in the citizen‟s desire to keep a \nwatchful eye on the workings of public agencies [citations], and in a newspaper \npublisher‟s intention to publish information concerning the operation of government, \n[citations.]”  (Id. at pp. 597-598, fns. omitted, italics added.)  The right of access is \npresumptive, not absolute, and the court observed that while its precise contours elude \neasy definition, “[t]he few cases that have recognized such a right do agree that the \ndecision as to access is one best left to the sound discretion of the trial court, a discretion \nto be exercised in light of the relevant facts and circumstances of the particular case.”  \n(Id. at 598-599.)  \n  The Bar asserts that the common law right is circumscribed by the parameters of \nthe parallel, but distinct, First Amendment right of access to court records, and therefore \nthat it is limited to official adjudicatory records.  We disagree.  In contrast to the common \nlaw rule, the more recently developed right of access to court records grounded in the \nFirst Amendment derives from the United States Supreme Court‟s recognition of a First \n                                              \n  3  These statements of policy are instructive even though the open meeting and \npublic record acts do not apply to the Bar.  (Chronicle Pub. Co. v. Superior Court (1960) \n54 Cal.2d 548, 573.)   \n  7 \n\nAmendment right to open trials (see Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia (1980) 448 \nU.S. 555, 592), and has generally been limited to official court records of adjudicatory \nproceedings.  (See, e.g., NBC Subsidiary, supra, 20 Cal.4th at pp. 1198-1209 & fn. 25; \nMercury Interactive Corp. v. Klein (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 60, 67-68.)   \n  Almost 20 years after Nixon, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia rejected an interpretation that limited the scope of the common law right to \nofficial adjudicatory records in a markedly similar way as the Bar argues in this case.  \nWashington Legal Foundation v. United States Sentencing Commission (D.C. Cir. 1996) \n89 F.3d 897 concerned a request for access to the records of an advisory group to the \nUnited States Sentencing Commission.  There, as here, the records sought were those of \n“a government entity . . . that is within the judicial branch but is not a court.”  (Id. at p. \n903, italics added.)  The district court concluded the documents were not public records \nwithin the meaning of the common law right of access because that right applies only to \nthose documents which are “ „akin to court documents.‟ ”  (Id. at p. 900.) \n  The court of appeals rejected the district court‟s restrictive view.  “Unlike the \ndistrict court in the present case, we are not persuaded by the narrow focus of the federal \ncases that the common law right is limited to records that are „similar . . . to court \ndocuments.‟  The Supreme Court‟s reference in Nixon to „a general right to inspect and \ncopy public records and documents, including judicial records and documents,‟ [citation], \nclearly implies that judicial records are but a subset of the universe of documents to \nwhich the common law right applies.  [Citations.]  Indeed, it has been said in this district \nthat „the general rule is that all three branches of government, legislative, executive and \njudicial, are subject to the common law right.‟  [Citation.] ”  (Washington Legal \nFoundation v. United States Sentencing Commission, supra, 89 F.3d at p. 903, italics \nadded; see also Schwartz v. United States Department of Justice (D.D.C. 1977) 435 \nF.Supp. 1203 [common law right applies to all three branches of government].)  Although \nthere are few cases addressing this question, those that we have found demonstrate that \nCalifornia law has long recognized that right.  (Craemer v. Superior Court (1968) 265 \n  8 \n\nCal.App.2d 216, 220 & fn. 3; Mushet v. Dept. of Public Service (1917) 35 Cal.App. 630, \n636-638.) \n  We also disagree with the trial court‟s conclusion that the First Amendment right \nof access to court documents has “absorbed” the common law right to government \ninformation.  None of the cases cited by the Bar so hold, and our independent research \nhas failed to produce any precedent that suggests the more recently established First \nAmendment right has swallowed up the historically and analytically distinct right under \nthe common law.  To the contrary, cases decided well after the genesis of the First \nAmendment right have continued to recognize the separate and distinct common law \nright of access.  (See, e.g., KNSD Channels 7/39 v. Superior Court (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th \n1200, 1203; Valley Broadcasting Co. v. United States District Court (9th Cir. 1986) 798 \nF.2d 1289, 1293 [common law right of access furthers the same concerns protected by the \nFirst Amendment but is separate and distinct from the constitutional right]; Stone v. \nUniversity of Maryland Medical System Corp. (4th Cir. 1988) 855 F.2d 178, 180 [distinct \ndoctrines]; In re Copley Press, Inc. (9th Cir. 2008) 518 F.3d 1022, 1029; Lugosch v. \nPyramid Co. (2nd Cir. 2006) 435 F.3d 110, 126 [different burdens under First \nAmendment and common law rights]; In re Providence Journal Co. (1st Cir. 2002) 293 \nF.3d 1, 10 [the two rights of access are not coterminous, although they overlap “because \nthe jurisprudence discussing the First Amendment right of access . . . has been derived in \nlarge measure from the jurisprudence that has shaped the common-law right of access”].)  \nThe two rights of access to government information remain independently viable despite \nareas of overlap. \nB.  Cases Addressing Access to Records of Adjudicatory Bodies Are Not \nDispositive of Appellants’ Request \n  The issue presented here may not inevitably lead to production of the documents \nand information sought by appellants.  That would only occur after further proceedings in \nthe trial court.  We only consider whether the common law rule of presumptive access to \n  9 \n\npublic information extends to the Bar‟s admission records,4 subject to balancing against \nthe private interests implicated by disclosure.   \n  The Bar provides no compelling reason that it does not.  The Bar is a public \ncorporation and the records sought relate to its official function of administering the bar \nexam, a matter of legitimate public interest.  (See Mack v. State Bar of California (2001) \n92 Cal.App.4th 957, 962; Greene v. Zank (1984) 158 Cal.App.3d 497, 504-507; Bus. & \nProf. Code, §§ 6001, 6064.)  Citing Copley Press, Inc. v. Superior Court (1992) 6 Cal. \nApp. 4th 106, the Bar observes that court records subject to presumptive disclosure are \nlimited to those “ „which accurately and officially reflects the work of the court, such as \nits orders and judgments, its scheduling and administration of cases, its assignment of \njudicial officers and administrators[,]‟ ” while other court documents “created or simply \nmaintained by court personnel are internal documents to which the public has no right of \ninspection.”  Since the records Sander wishes to review are not in the former category, \nthe Bar reasons they are not subject to public access.  In other words, the Bar claims that \nbecause it is part of the judicial branch its records are immune from the common law \npresumption of access unless they are “adjudicatory” documents.  As the argument goes, \nsince the Bar is not in the business of adjudication, its records are not adjudicatory and \nneed not be disclosed. \n  But the Bar‟s argument is premised on the implicit notion that the Bar, as the \nagency charged with overseeing attorney admission to the practice of law, is subject to \nthe specific considerations that have shaped the parameters of the public right of access to \ncourt records.  Those considerations are expressed neatly in Copley Press, Inc.:  “The \ncraft of the lawyer, judge and clerk involves important but elusive concepts, such as \nlogic, justice, equity and the rule of law; however, the physical manifestation of these \nideas is the written word.  Courts may not produce much heat or light, and in fact not \nvery much of a tangible nature at all, but they produce prodigious quantities of words.  \n                                              \n  4  We clarify that we express no opinion as to the application of the law to records \nof Bar disciplinary matters.   \n  10 \n\nThe end product of all this effort is hopefully accurate, well conceived and generally \nbeneficial.  In order to reach that end result, however, an awful lot of defective words \nneeds to be produced. . . . [¶]  The very nature of preliminary drafts, personal notes and \nrough records is such as to argue against their inspection by third parties.  Such \ninspection and possible use would in many cases be detrimental to the user, since the \nmaterials in [this category] are tentative, often wrong, and sometimes misleading.  It is \nfor this very reason that these materials are not regarded as official court records—they \ndo not speak for the court and do not constitute court action.  Perhaps more importantly, a \nrequirement that [these] materials be made available for public view would severely \nhamper the users of the materials.  The reason for preparation of a first draft is to extract \nraw and immature thoughts from the brain to paper, so that they can be refined and \ncorrected.  The judge‟s personal benchnotes are constructed so as to remind him, in his \npersonal fashion and not in a form digestible by the public, of the aspects of the case he \nthought important.  Much more harm would be done to the judicial process by requiring \nthis [category of] material to be available to the public, than would ever be overborne by \nany benefit the public might derive thereby.”  (Copley Press, Inc. v. Superior Court, \nsupra, 6 Cal. App. 4th at pp. 114-115.) \n  At oral argument, counsel for the Bar asserted that all of its records are judicial \nrecords, relying on the Bar‟s placement in article VI of the California Constitution.  But \nthe courts of record in this state are the Supreme Court, courts of appeal, and superior \ncourts.  (Cal. Const., art. VI, § 1.)  The Bar is not a court.  It is a public corporation.  (Cal. \nConst., art. VI, § 9; Bus. & Prof. Code, § 6001.)  Although it has been described as an \nadministrative arm of the Supreme Court for purposes of assisting in matters of \nadmission and discipline, the Bar also remains subject to control by the Legislature.  \n(Chronicle Publishing Co. v. Superior Court (1960) 54 Cal.2d 548, 564.)  The Bar has \nbroad powers to investigate complaints and conduct formal disciplinary proceedings (id. \nat p. 565), and it may perform judicial functions in certain cases in connection with its \nresponsibilities over discipline and admission.  (See Rules of the State Bar, tit. V, Rules \nof Procedure, rules 5.1 et seq.; tit. IV, Admissions and Educational Standards., rule 4.6.)  \n  11 \n\nBut the Bar is not a court and does not function as a court for all purposes.  The Bar is \ncontrolled by a board of governors, composed of a group of members and its president, \nthat is vested with oversight of its executive functions.  (Bus. & Prof. Code, §§ 6010, \n6011, 6030.)  It has many responsibilities that are more administrative than judicial.  \nThese include administration of the Bar exam, oversight of legal specialization and \ncertification programs, the special masters program, the lawyer assistance program, \nforeign or out-of-state legal consultants, client security funds, lawyer referral services,  \nand certification of legal education providers.  (See Rules of the State Bar, tit. III, \nPrograms and Services, div. 2, chs. 4-7, div. 3, chs. 1-4, div. 4, ch. 1, div. 5, chs. 1, 4; tit. \nIV, Admissions and Educational Standards, div. 1, ch. 5.) \n  Appellants are not seeking judicial records that pertain to the Bar‟s adjudicatory \nfunctions or preliminary notes, rough drafts or personal notes that may bear upon duties \npertinent to admission to the Bar.  Instead, they seek data obtained from Bar applicants.  \nDisclosure of the Bar‟s admissions data does not necessarily raise the concerns peculiar \nto the courts that have driven the development of the rule shielding many preliminary, \nunofficial court documents from public access.  We perceive no basis for holding the \nBar‟s raw admission data immune from public scrutiny because they do not satisfy the \ntest devised to distinguish between the official work product of the courts and their \npreliminary, nonadjudicative records.  Moreover, applying the \nadjudicatory/nonadjudicatory test here, as the Bar urges us to do, would seemingly \nexempt all records of any administrative arm of the judicial branch of government from \nthe longstanding common law presumption of access to public records5 without the \njustification that exists for the particular protections afforded to nonadjudicative records \nproduced by the courts.  The Bar cites no persuasive authority for such an unwarranted \nexemption.  \n                                              \n  5  We are aware that the recent adoption of rule 10.500 of the California Rules of \nCourt (effective Jan. 1, 2010) expressly affords public access to certain nondeliberative \nand nonadjudicative records of most judicial branch entities.  (Rule 10.500(a)(1).)  This \nrule, however, does not apply to the Bar.  (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 10.500(c)(3).)   \n  12 \n\nC.  The Public Access Determination Requires Balancing Applicants’ Privacy \nConcerns and the Burden Imposed on the Bar Against Public Policy Favoring \nTransparency \n  Another basis for the trial court‟s ruling was its observation that “neither Nixon \nnor any other case nor argument provided by Sander provides criteria by which I can \ndetermine whether the data sought in this case are „public‟ records . . . .”  Here, too, we \ndisagree with the analysis.  In context, the criteria that govern application of the \npresumptive right of disclosure are stated in Craemer: “[W]here there is no contrary \nstatute or countervailing public policy, the right to inspect public records must be freely \nallowed.  In this regard the term ‘public policy’ means anything which tends to \nundermine that sense of security for individual rights, whether of personal liberty or \nprivate property, which any citizen ought to feel has a tendency to be injurious to the \npublic or public good.”  (Craemer v. Superior Court, supra, 265 Cal.App.2d at p. 222, \nitalics added; see also CBS, Inc. v. Block (1986) 42 Cal.3d 646, 662.)  The trial courts are \ncharged with exercising their discretion “in light of the relevant facts and circumstances” \n(Nixon, supra, 435 U.S. at pp. 598-599) to balance such policy factors against “the policy \nof this state that public records and documents be kept open for public inspection in order \nto prevent secrecy in public affairs.”  (Craemer, supra, at p. 222.)  The Legislature has \nprescribed the same test when, as here, a public entity asserts a privilege to not disclose \nofficial information—i.e., “information acquired in confidence by a public employee in \nthe course of his or her duty and not open, or officially disclosed, to the public prior to \nthe time the claim of privilege is made.”  (Evid. Code, § 1040, subd. (a).)  To invoke the \nprivilege, the claimant (with exceptions not relevant here) must show that disclosure \ncontravenes the public interest “because there is a necessity for preserving the \nconfidentiality of the information that outweighs the necessity for disclosure in the \ninterest of justice . . . .”  (Evid. Code, § 1040, subd. (b)(2).) \n  Here, while the Bar‟s rules address the disclosure of documents pertaining to \nmany of its administrative responsibilities, they state that: “Applicant records are \nconfidential unless required to be disclosed by law . . . .”  (State Bar Rules, tit. IV, \n  13 \n\nAdmissions and Educational Standards, div. 1, rule 4.4.)  Thus, even the Bar \nacknowledges that the confidentiality of applicant records is not absolute.  Both case law \nand statute require the court to determine whether disclosure is required by balancing \napplicants‟ privacy concerns and the burden imposed on the Bar against the strong public \npolicy favoring openness in public affairs. \n  We hold the court erred in ruling that the common law presumption of access to \npublic information is limited to adjudicatory documents related to court proceedings and, \nto the extent the court acknowledged the common law presumptive right of access applies \nto public records generally, that it erred in declining to assess any countervailing public \npolicy considerations against the public policy favoring access.  Whether those \nconsiderations are such as to outweigh the presumptive right of access must therefore be \naddressed on remand, as must the relevance of the excluded declarations to those issues.  \nThe trial court is in the best position to weigh the competing interests and strike the \nappropriate balance. \n  In light of these conclusions, we do not reach the constitutional issues concerning \nthe potential application of Proposition 59 to Sander‟s records request.  We also decline \nto reach the question of whether Sander‟s request would impermissibly require the \ncreation of a “new” record.  The trial court considered this issue and, in addition to \nfinding it mooted by its conclusion that Sander had no legal basis for access to the Bar‟s \nadmission records, found the factual record was inadequately developed to resolve the \nissue.  That latter determination was firmly within the court‟s discretion and we will not \ndisturb it. \nDISPOSITION \n  The judgment is reversed and the matter is remanded for further proceedings. \n  14 \n\n \n \n \n              _________________________ \n              Siggins, J. \n \n \nWe concur: \n \n \n_________________________ \nMcGuiness, P.J. \n \n \n_________________________ \nPollak, J. \n  15 \n\n \nTrial Court:  Superior Court of the City and County of \n  San Francisco  \n \n \nTrial Judge:  Honorable Curtis E.A.
