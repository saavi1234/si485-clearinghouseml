Plaintiff is the personal representative of the estate of an inmate who committed suicide while detained in the Sheridan County Jail. Plaintiff claimed that Defendants' negligent conduct deprived the deceased of rights, privileges and immunities secured by the U.S. Constitution. Particularly, Plaintiff claimed that the deceased was deprived of his constitutional liberty interest in due process, equal protection and bodily integrity and in freedom from excessive punishment and indifference to his medical needs. Plaintiff asked the court for both compensatory and punitive damages, attorney's fees, and other relief that the court might deem equitable and proper.</p><p>After a few rounds of dismissals and amendments, Plaintiff filed a fifth amended complaint on February 10, 2009, which became the surviving complaint of this action. In May 2010, right before the scheduled trial, the parties notified the court of a possible settlement and the scheduled trial was cancelled. On May 06, 2010, Plaintiff filed a motion to enforce settlement with the court. On May 07, 2010, the parties held a hearing before Magistrate Judge Thomas D. Thalken to resolve some disputes over the settlement agreement. A settlement agreement was finally reached. On September 15, 2010, the court granted Plaintiff's motion to dismiss, subject to the preservation of claims contained in the settlement agreement between the parties.</p><p>Although a copy of the settlement agreement is not immediately available, in an interview with the local press, the attorney for the plaintiff detailed its terms. Defendant agreed to pay $100,000.00 to the mother of the dead prisoner and to provide training in suicide prevention.</p><p></p>",

(LeRoy) Eastman (“EASTMAN”) is a resident of Rosebud, South Dakota.\nDefendant County of Sheridan (“COUNTY”) is a Nebraska political subdivision.  Defendant\nLevi McKillet (“MCKILLET”) was employed by Defendant COUNTY as a correctional\nofficer/jailer at all relevant times, and is liable for his actions in his individual and official\ncapacities.  Defendants DOES 1 - 5 are and were employed by Defendant COUNTY as\ncorrectional officers, jailers, and/or law enforcement officers at all relevant times, and are liable\n1\n\nCase: 7:07-cv-05004-JFB-TDT   Document #: 58    Date Filed: 10/22/07   Page 2 of 13\nfor their actions in their individual and official capacities.  Any and all actions undertaken by any\n2.\nThis action is brought pursuant to the provisions of  U.S.C. §1983.  The proper venue for this\naction is the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska because the acts and\nomissions complained of herein occurred in Rushville, Sheridan County, Nebraska.\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n3.\nOn July 19, 2005, Lino Lowell Spotted Elk (“SPOTTED ELK”), then age 20, was\narrested in Rushville, Sheridan County, Nebraska on an outstanding warrant, and was taken to\nthe Sheridan County Jail in Rushville.\n4.\nCOUNTY agents and employees booked SPOTTED ELK into the jail, with the\nexpectation that SPOTTED ELK would stay in the jail at least until a bond hearing could be\nconvened and potentially until the disposition of the charge for which SPOTTED ELK had an\noutstanding warrant. Nevertheless, COUNTY agents and employees did not provide SPOTTED\nELK with a jail uniform and remove SPOTTED ELK’s access to his own clothing, including his\nbelt.\n5.\nCOUNTY agents and employees, including MCKILLET, failed to inquire regarding\nSPOTTED ELK’s mental health and suicidality during the intake/booking process in violation of\nthe Nebraska Jail Standards, despite that SPOTTED ELK exhibited objective signs of clinically-\ndiagnosable  and treatable mental illness and suicidality. SPOTTED ELK talked of suicide and\n2\n\nCase: 7:07-cv-05004-JFB-TDT   Document #: 58    Date Filed: 10/22/07   Page 3 of 13\nwas intoxicated to the point at which his reasoning and coping skills were impaired, which are\nindicators for mental health care triggering a civil and constitutional duty to protect SPOTTED\nELK on the part of Defendants.  From SPOTTED ELK’s statements and based on the Nebraska\nJail Standards’ requirements for assessing mental health of prisoners upon intake, Defendants\nknew or should have known that SPOTTED ELK was mentally ill and suicidal. \n6.\nCOUNTY agents and employees thereafter disregarded and were deliberately indifferent\nto warning signs in SPOTTED ELK’s words and behavior of mental illness and suicidality.  The\nneed for medical care for SPOTTED ELK was so obvious that a trained jail person would or\nshould recognize it.\n7.\nOther inmates heard noise and struggling in SPOTTED ELK’s cell and called for help,\nbut were ignored.  Approximately one hour after his arrest, SPOTTED ELK was found hanging\nfrom his own belt in his cell.  At the time of his death, SPOTTED ELK also had head contusions\nand visible injuries that he did not have before his arrest\n8.\nSuicide is a known risk to detainees in any detention center.  The Nebraska Jail Standards\nrequire that jails train employees, and that employees follow such training, to assess detainees for\nmental health and suicidality upon booking into the jail.  Notwithstanding, MCKILLET and\nDOES 1-5 did not assess SPOTTED ELK for mental health and suicidality and failed to respond\nto signs that he was mentally ill and suicidal, or to calls for help from other inmates who heard\nthe noise and struggling in SPOTTED ELK’s cell. \n3\n\nCase: 7:07-cv-05004-JFB-TDT   Document #: 58    Date Filed: 10/22/07   Page 4 of 13\nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 – ALL DEFENDANTS\nEASTMAN incorporates Paragraphs 1-8 above as if fully set forth herein.\n9.\nSPOTTED ELK had a right under the Constitution of the United States to be free from all\npunishment (given that he was a pretrial detainee), and from indifference to his medical needs, as\nwell as a right to due process and equal protection, by employees of governmental entities.\n10.\nAt all times relevant to this Complaint, MCKILLET and DOES 1-10 were acting under\ncolor of law – under the constitutions, statutes, administrative rules, customs, policies and usages\nof the County of Sheridan, State of Nebraska and the United States – and had assumed the\nresponsibilities, activities, and rights involved in exercising their roles as members of\nCOUNTY’s professional staff.\n11.\nWhen SPOTTED ELK was under Defendants’ supervision and custody, Defendants acted\nwith deliberate indifference to SPOTTED ELK’s known and recognized constitutional and legal\nrights to due process, equal protection and bodily integrity (meaning, the right to life, to pursue\nhis right to life and to have his body protected from harm to the extent that every human being\nhas the same right to life and protection from harm), and to be free from indifference to his\nmedical needs.  To Plaintiff’s best knowledge or belief, SPOTTED ELK was a young Native\n4\n\nCase: 7:07-cv-05004-JFB-TDT   Document #: 58    Date Filed: 10/22/07   Page 5 of 13\nAmerican man and the named Defendants MCKILLET and the JOHN DOES, were white, and\nthat part of the reason why Defendants were so callous and uncaring toward SPOTTED ELK and\nother Native American detainees was because of SPOTTED ELKS’ race.  Defendants actively\nparticipated in the deprivation of SPOTTED ELK’s constitutional rights by causing SPOTTED\nELK’s injuries and suicide.  This includes subjecting SPOTTED ELK to disparate treatment\nbased on the fact that SPOTTED ELK was Native American (Lakota), and COUNTY’s\nemployees are Caucasian: Defendants made decisions based in racial animus regarding the need\nto follow jail procedures (including procedures for removal of prisoners’ belts), the need to\nassess SPOTTED ELK for mental illness/suicidality, and the need to provide SPOTTED ELK\nwith adequate protection and medical care relative to mental illness/suicidality.\n12.\nDefendants’ conduct, within his duties as a member of COUNTY’s professional staff,\nunder color of state law, deprived SPOTTED ELK of rights, privileges and immunities secured\nby the United States Constitution. Particularly, SPOTTED ELK was deprived of his\nconstitutional liberty interest in due process, equal protection and bodily integrity and in freedom\nfrom excessive punishment and indifference to his medical needs.  This includes subjecting\nSPOTTED ELK to disparate treatment based on the fact that SPOTTED ELK was Native\nAmerican (Lakota), and COUNTY’s employees are Caucasian: Defendants made decisions based\nin racial animus regarding the need to follow jail procedures (including procedures for removal\nof prisoners’ belts), the need to assess SPOTTED ELK for mental illness/suicidality, and the\nneed to provide SPOTTED ELK with adequate protection and medical care relative to mental\nillness/suicidality.  When Defendants assumed the role of guardians/custodians of certain\n5\n\nCase: 7:07-cv-05004-JFB-TDT   Document #: 58    Date Filed: 10/22/07   Page 6 of 13\nprisoners, inmates, detainees or persons, Defendants are charged with the legal obligation to\nabide by at least the minimal protections of individual citizens’ constitutional rights, and not to\nsubject any person within the Defendants’ care, custody, and control, and not to cause or prevent\nbodily harm or death to be had upon any detainee.  Even an accused citizen in custody of\nDefendants, is entitled to be protected against the violation of even the most base constitutional\nprotections while in custody, and not to be subject to negligent and/or intentional violations of\nDefendants own policies, procedures and protocol, which policies were likely designed to\nprovide protection against the loss of a citizen’s bodily integrity through serious bodily injury,\nmaiming or death, such as in the case of SPOTTED ELK.\n13.\nAs a result of Defendants’ deprivation of SPOTTED ELK’s constitutional liberty interests\ndescribed above, EASTMAN has incurred damages.\nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 – DEFENDANT COUNTY\n14.\nEASTMAN incorporates paragraphs 1-13 above as if fully set forth herein.\nCount I – Policy or custom of ignoring reports\n15.\nCOUNTY had a special relationship with SPOTTED ELK by virtue of the fact that\nCOUNTY had custody and control over SPOTTED ELK, such that SPOTTED ELK could not\ncare for his own medical needs while incarcerated. In so doing, COUNTY had a duty to exercise\n6\n\nCase: 7:07-cv-05004-JFB-TDT   Document #: 58    Date Filed: 10/22/07   Page 7 of 13\nreasonable care in the selection, training, assignment, supervision and retention of its\nprofessional staff, including MCKILLET and DOES. \n16.\nBy those failures set forth above, COUNTY acted with deliberate indifference to a known\nrisk of constitutional deprivation to SPOTTED ELK and other detainees incarcerated in the\nSheridan County Jail.   COUNTY thus acted according to a persistent, widespread practice of jail\nemployees, which is so common and well-settled as to constitute a custom fairly representing\nmunicipal policy of providing inadequate assessment of and care for suicidal detainees.\n17.\nAs a result of COUNTY’s deliberate indifference to the risk of deprivation of SPOTTED\nELK’s constitutional liberty interests, EASTMAN incurred damages as set forth below.\n18.\nSPOTTED ELK could not have reasonably discovered that COUNTY had a custom or\npractice of tolerating misconduct by employees, and of failing to provide adequate training and\nstaffing to implement reasonable suicide prevention practices, because such knowledge was\nspecifically held by officers and agents of COUNTY.\nCount II-Failure to Train\n19.\nAt all times relevant to this Complaint, COUNTY had a custom or practice of failing to\ntrain its employees to be observant of and act upon signs and indications of suicidality in\ndetainees. COUNTY failed to implement training materials and programs related to recognizing\n7\n\nCase: 7:07-cv-05004-JFB-TDT   Document #: 58    Date Filed: 10/22/07   Page 8 of 13\nand understanding patterns of mental illness and suicide.  In particular, COUNTY failed to train\nits employees to recognize the dangers and warning signs of suicide.\n20.\nBy failing to train its employees to recognize warning signs and dangers of mental illness\nand suicidality in detainees, COUNTY acted with deliberate indifference to a known risk of\nconstitutional deprivation to SPOTTED ELK and other detainees.\n21.\nAs a result of COUNTY’s deliberate indifference to the risk of deprivation of SPOTTED\nELK’s constitutional liberty interests set forth above, EASTMAN has incurred damages as set\nforth below.\nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION\nNEGLIGENT SUPERVISION AND RETENTION BY EPSD\n22.\nPlaintiff incorporates paragraphs 1-21 above as if fully set forth herein.\n23.\nThe wrongful death of SPOTTED ELK was proximately caused by COUNTY in one or\nmore of the following particulars:\na. Failure to adequately assess SPOTTED ELK for mental illness and suicidality upon\nbooking SPOTTED ELK into the jail;\nb. Failure to adequately monitor and obtain mental health assistance for SPOTTED ELK in\nthe time between his admission to the jail and his death;\nc. Failure to train and supervise employees and agents in suicide assessment and suicide\nprevention, and to provide adequate staffing to carry out reasonable suicide assessment\nand prevention procedures;\n8\n\nCase: 7:07-cv-05004-JFB-TDT   Document #: 58    Date Filed: 10/22/07   Page 9 of 13\nd. Failure to follow Defendant’s own procedures for suicide prevention and assessment;\ne. Failure to respond reasonably to sounds and signs of distress by SPOTTED ELK in his\ncell.\n24.\nAs a result of COUNTY’s negligent supervision and training of its professional staff and\nagents, EASTMAN has incurred damages as set forth below.\n25.\nOn July 17, 2006, EASTMAN submitted a Notice of Administrative Claim to the\nSheridan County Commissioners, the Sheridan County Clerk, the Sheridan County Attorney, the\nSheridan County Sheriff and the Sheridan County Jail Administrator.  More than six months\nhave passed with no response from Defendants.  Accordingly, on February 8, 2007, Plaintiff\nwithdrew her claim.\nPUNITIVE DAMAGES\n26.\nPlaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraph 1-25 above as\nthough fully set fourth herein. \n27.\nIn addition to compensatory damages, EASTMAN hereby makes a claim for punitive\ndamages against defendants in an amount to be proven at trial for the willful and wanton acts and\nomissions of Defendants, to include violation of SPOTTED ELK’s civil rights, as alleged herein. \nThe acts and omissions of Defendants in this case were so gross and culpable in nature that they\nconstitute reckless indifference and wanton disregard for the law and for the lives and safety of\n9\n\nCase: 7:07-cv-05004-JFB-TDT   Document #: 58    Date Filed: 10/22/07   Page 10 of 13\nothers, including SPOTTED ELK.  Defendants committed the acts and omissions alleged herein\nand subjected SPOTTED ELK to improper treatment that caused SPOTTED ELK to suffer\npsychological and psychiatric harm so severe that no person should be expected to endure it. \nDefendants’ actions should be punished, and an example should be made so that these actions\nand omissions are not repeated.\n28.\nThe recovery of punitive damages is permitted under the federal civil rights statutes for\nreckless and callous indifference to the federally protected rights of others, and is thus\nappropriate in this case.  This instance of reckless and callous indifference to SPOTTED ELK’s\nsafety and constitutional rights should be punished through the imposition of punitive damages\nso as to make an example of conduct that will not be tolerated.\n29.\nPlaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations contained in 1-28 above as though fully\nset forth herein.\n30.\nAs a result of defendants’ actions as alleged herein, EASTMAN has been required to\nretain the services of attorneys and are entitled to a reasonable amount for attorney’s fee pursuant\nto 42 U.S.C. § 1988 for those violations covered by the Civil Rights Act.\nDAMAGES\n31.\nPlaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraph 1-30 above as\n10\n\nCase: 7:07-cv-05004-JFB-TDT   Document #: 58    Date Filed: 10/22/07   Page 11 of 13\nthough fully set forth herein. \n32.\nThe acts and omissions of defendants as set forth above have resulted in SPOTTED\nELK’s death and damages to EASTMAN.

This instance of reckless and callous  indifference to SPOTTED ELK’s safety and\nconstitutional rights should be punished through the imposition of punitive damages so as to make\nan example of conduct that will not be tolerated.\nATTORNEY’S FEES\n29.\n Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations contained in 1-28 above as though fully\nset forth herein.\n30.\nAs a result of defendants’ actions as alleged herein, EASTMAN has been required to retain\nthe services of attorneys and are entitled to a reasonable amount for attorney’s fee pursuant to 42\nU.S.C. § 1988 for those violations covered by the Civil Rights Act.\n8\n\nCase: 7:07-cv-05004-JFB-TDT   Document #: 1-1    Date Filed: 02/09/07   Page 9 of 11\nDAMAGES\n31.\nPlaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraph 1-30 above as\nthough fully set forth herein. \n32.\nThe acts and omissions of defendants as set forth above have resulted in SPOTTED ELK’s\ndeath and damages to EASTMAN.

Eastman, Personal Representative of the Estate of Lino Lowell Spotted Elk, Jr.,\nDeceased, Plaintiff in the above-captioned matter, by and through her counsel of record, for her\ncause of action against Defendants, states as follows:\nPARTIES, JURISDICTION AND VENUE\n1.\nArlyn J. (LeRoy) Eastman (“EASTMAN”) is a resident of Rapid City, South Dakota.\nDefendant County of Sheridan (“COUNTY”) is a Nebraska political subdivision.  Defendant Levi\nMCKILLIP (“MCKILLIP”) was employed by Defendant COUNTY as a correctional officer/jailer at\nall relevant times, and is liable for his actions in his individual capacity.  Defendants DOES 1 - 5 are\nand were employed by Defendant COUNTY as correctional officers, jailers, and/or law enforcement\nofficers at all relevant times, and are liable for their actions in their individual capacities.  Any and\nall actions undertaken by any and all of the Defendants constituted actions under color of state law.\nThe damages in this case exceed $75,000.00 in value.\n\n7:07-cv-05004-JFB-TDT   Doc # 92   Filed: 02/10/09   Page 2 of 11 - Page ID # 330\n2.\nThis action is brought pursuant to the provisions of 28 U.S.C. §§1331 and 1333 and 42\nU.S.C. §1983.  The proper venue for this action is the United States District Court for the District\nof Nebraska because the acts and omissions complained of herein occurred in Rushville, Sheridan\nCounty, Nebraska.\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n3.\nOn July 19, 2005, Lino Lowell Spotted Elk (“SPOTTED ELK”), then age 20, was arrested\nin Rushville, Sheridan County, Nebraska on an outstanding warrant, and was taken to the Sheridan\nCounty Jail in Rushville.  \n4.\nCOUNTY agents and employees booked SPOTTED ELK into the jail, with the expectation\nthat SPOTTED ELK would stay in the jail at least until a bond hearing could be convened and\npotentially until the disposition of the charge for which SPOTTED ELK had an outstanding warrant.\nNevertheless, COUNTY agents and employees did not provide SPOTTED ELK with a jail uniform\nand remove SPOTTED ELK’s access to his own clothing, including his belt.\n5.\nCOUNTY agents and employees who transported SPOTTED ELK to the jail failed to report\nthat, during the drive from the site of SPOTTED ELK’s arrest to the jail, SPOTTED ELK exhibited\nobjective signs of clinically-diagnosable and treatable mental illness and suicidality.  This failure\nviolated COUNTY policy, written or unwritten, requiring law enforcement to report to jailers any\n2\n\n7:07-cv-05004-JFB-TDT   Doc # 92   Filed: 02/10/09   Page 3 of 11 - Page ID # 331\nrelevant information relating to risk of harm (including self-harm) to a prisoner.\n6.\nIn violation of COUNTY policy, COUNTY agents and employees, including MCKILLIP,\nfailed to inquire of the arresting officer regarding SPOTTED ELK’s mental health and suicidality\nduring  the  intake/booking  process  in  violation  of  the Nebraska  Jail  Standards,  despite  that\nSPOTTED ELK exhibited objective signs of clinically-diagnosable and treatable mental illness and\nsuicidality.  SPOTTED ELK talked of suicide and was intoxicated to the point at which his reasoning\nand coping skills were impaired, which are indicators for mental health care triggering a civil and\nconstitutional duty to protect SPOTTED ELK on the part of Defendants.  From SPOTTED ELK’s\nstatements and based on the Nebraska Jail Standards’ requirements for assessing mental health of\nprisoners upon intake, Defendants knew or should have known that SPOTTED ELK was mentally\nill and suicidal.   \n7.\nCOUNTY agents, including but not limited to MCKILLIP, violated COUNTY policy by their\nfailure to perform a reasonable pat search of SPOTTED ELK before committing him to a jail cell.\nA reasonable pat search would have revealed that SPOTTED ELK was wearing a belt, which should\nhave been removed from him according to COUNTY policy.  \n8.\nCOUNTY agents and employees thereafter disregarded and were deliberately indifferent to\nwarning signs in SPOTTED ELK’s words and behavior of mental illness and suicidality.  The need\nfor medical care for SPOTTED ELK was so obvious that a trained jail person would or should\n3\n\n7:07-cv-05004-JFB-TDT   Doc # 92   Filed: 02/10/09   Page 4 of 11 - Page ID # 332\nrecognize it.\n9.\nOther inmates heard noise and struggling in SPOTTED ELK’s cell and called for help, but\nwere ignored.  Approximately fifteen minutes after his arrest, SPOTTED ELK was found hanging\nfrom his own belt in his cell.  At the time of his death, SPOTTED ELK also had head contusions and\nvisible injuries that he did not have before his arrest.\n10.\nSuicide is a known risk to detainees in any detention center.  The Nebraska Jail Standards\nrequire that jails train employees, and that employees follow such training, to assess detainees for\nmental health and suicidality upon booking into the jail.  Notwithstanding, MCKILLIP and DOES\n1-5 did not assess SPOTTED ELK for mental health and suicidality and failed to respond to signs\nthat he was mentally ill and suicidal, or to calls for help from other inmates who heard the noise and\nstruggling in SPOTTED ELK’s cell.  \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 – ALL DEFENDANTS\n11.\nEASTMAN incorporates Paragraphs 1-10 above as if fully set forth herein.\n12.\nSPOTTED ELK had a right under the Constitution of the United States to be free from all\npunishment (given that he was a pretrial detainee), and from indifference to his medical needs, as\nwell as a right to due process and equal protection, by employees of governmental entities.\n4\n\n7:07-cv-05004-JFB-TDT   Doc # 92   Filed: 02/10/09   Page 5 of 11 - Page ID # 333\n13.\nAt all times relevant to this Complaint, MCKILLIP and DOES 1-5 were acting under color\nof law – under the constitutions, statutes, administrative rules, customs, policies and usages of the\nCounty of Sheridan, State of Nebraska and the United States – and had assumed the responsibilities,\nactivities, and rights involved in exercising their roles as members of COUNTY’s professional staff.\n14.\nWhen SPOTTED ELK was under Defendants’ supervision and custody, Defendants acted\nwith deliberate indifference to SPOTTED ELK’s known and recognized constitutional and legal\nrights to due process, equal protection and bodily integrity and to be free from indifference to his\nmedical  needs.    Defendants  actively  participated  in  the  deprivation  of  SPOTTED  ELK’s\nconstitutional rights by causing SPOTTED ELK’s injuries and suicide.  This includes subjecting\nSPOTTED ELK to disparate treatment based on the fact that SPOTTED ELK was Native American\n(Lakota), and COUNTY’s employees are Caucasian: Defendants made decisions based in racial\nanimus regarding the need to follow jail procedures (including procedures for removal of prisoners’\nbelts), the need to assess SPOTTED ELK for mental illness/suicidality, and the need to provide\nSPOTTED ELK with adequate protection and medical care relative to mental illness/suicidality.\n15.\nDefendants’ conduct, within his duties as a member of COUNTY’s professional staff, under\ncolor of state law, deprived SPOTTED ELK of rights, privileges and immunities secured by the\nUnited States Constitution.  Particularly, SPOTTED ELK was deprived of his constitutional liberty\ninterest in due process, equal protection and bodily integrity and in freedom from excessive\n5\n\n7:07-cv-05004-JFB-TDT   Doc # 92   Filed: 02/10/09   Page 6 of 11 - Page ID # 334\npunishment and indifference to his medical needs.  This includes subjecting SPOTTED ELK to\ndisparate treatment based on the fact that SPOTTED ELK was Native American (Lakota), and\nCOUNTY’s employees are Caucasian: Defendants made decisions based in racial animus regarding\nthe need to follow jail procedures (including procedures for removal of prisoners’ belts), the need to\nassess SPOTTED ELK for mental illness/suicidality, and the need to provide SPOTTED ELK with\nadequate protection and medical care relative to mental illness/suicidality.\n16.\nAs a result of Defendants’ deprivation of SPOTTED ELK’s constitutional liberty interests\ndescribed above, EASTMAN has incurred damages. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 – DEFENDANT COUNTY\n17.\nEASTMAN incorporates paragraphs 1-16 above as if fully set forth herein.\nCount I – Policy or custom of ignoring reports\n18.\nCOUNTY had a special relationship with SPOTTED ELK by virtue of the fact that\nCOUNTY had custody and control over SPOTTED ELK, such that SPOTTED ELK could not care\nfor his own medical needs while incarcerated.  In so doing, COUNTY had a duty to exercise\nreasonable care in the selection, training, assignment, supervision and retention of its professional\nstaff, including MCKILLIP and DOES.  \n19.\n6\n\n7:07-cv-05004-JFB-TDT   Doc # 92   Filed: 02/10/09   Page 7 of 11 - Page ID # 335\nBy those failures set forth above, COUNTY acted with deliberate indifference to a known\nrisk of constitutional deprivation to SPOTTED ELK and other detainees incarcerated in the\nSheridan County Jail.   COUNTY thus acted according to a persistent, widespread practice of jail\nemployees, which is so common and well-settled as to constitute a custom fairly representing\nmunicipal policy of providing inadequate assessment of and care for suicidal detainees.  \n20.\nAs a result of COUNTY’s deliberate indifference to the risk of deprivation of SPOTTED\nELK’s constitutional liberty interests, EASTMAN incurred damages as set forth below.\n21.\nSPOTTED ELK could not  have reasonably discovered that COUNTY had a custom or\npractice of tolerating misconduct by employees, and of failing to provide adequate training and\nstaffing  to  implement  reasonable  suicide  prevention  practices,  because  such  knowledge  was\nspecifically held by officers and agents of COUNTY.\nCount II – Failure to train\n22.\nAt all times relevant to this Complaint, COUNTY had a custom or practice of failing to train\nits employees to be observant of and act upon signs and indications of suicidality in detainees.\nCOUNTY  failed  to  implement  training  materials  and  programs  related  to  recognizing  and\nunderstanding patterns of mental illness and suicide.  In particular, COUNTY failed to train its\nemployees to recognize the dangers and warning signs of suicide.\n23.\n7\n\n7:07-cv-05004-JFB-TDT   Doc # 92   Filed: 02/10/09   Page 8 of 11 - Page ID # 336\nBy failing to train its employees to recognize warning signs and dangers of mental illness and\nsuicidality  in  detainees,  COUNTY  acted  with  deliberate  indifference  to  a  known  risk  of\nconstitutional deprivation to SPOTTED ELK and other detainees.\n24.\nAs a result of COUNTY’s deliberate indifference to the risk of deprivation of SPOTTED\nELK’s constitutional liberty interests set forth above, EASTMAN has incurred damages as set forth\nbelow.\nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION\nNEGLIGENT SUPERVISION AND RETENTION BY EPSD\n25.\nPlaintiff incorporates paragraphs 1-21 above as if fully set forth herein.\n26.\nThe wrongful death of SPOTTED ELK was proximately caused by COUNTY in one or more\nof the following particulars:\na. Failure to adequately assess SPOTTED ELK for mental illness and suicidality upon\nbooking SPOTTED ELK into the jail;\nb. Failure to adequately monitor and obtain mental health assistance for SPOTTED\nELK in the time between his admission to the jail and his death;\nc. Failure to train and supervise employees and agents in suicide assessment and suicide\nprevention,  and  to  provide  adequate  staffing  to  carry  out  reasonable  suicide\nassessment and prevention procedures;\nd. Failure to follow Defendant’s own procedures for suicide prevention and assessment;\ne. Failure to respond reasonably to sounds and signs of distress by SPOTTED ELK in\nhis cell.\n8\n\n7:07-cv-05004-JFB-TDT   Doc # 92   Filed: 02/10/09   Page 9 of 11 - Page ID # 337\nf. Failure to communicate with other COUNTY agents and employees regarding\nrelevant information about SPOTTED ELK’s behavior during transportation from\nthe site of his arrest to the jail;\ng. Failure to detect and remove SPOTTED ELK’s belt before placing SPOTTED ELK\nin a jail cell.\n27.\nAs a result of COUNTY’s negligent supervision and training of its professional staff and\nagents, EASTMAN has incurred damages as set forth below.\n28.\nOn July 17, 2006, EASTMAN submitted a Notice of Administrative Claim to the Sheridan\nCounty Commissioners, the Sheridan County Clerk, the Sheridan County Attorney, the Sheridan\nCounty Sheriff and the Sheridan County Jail Administrator.  More than six months have passed with\nno response from Defendants.  Accordingly, on February 8, 2007, Plaintiff withdrew her claim.\nATTORNEY’S FEES\n29.\n Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations contained in 1-28 above as though fully\nset forth herein.\n30.\nAs a result of defendants’ actions as alleged herein, EASTMAN has been required to retain\nthe services of attorneys and are entitled to a reasonable amount for attorney’s fee pursuant to 42\nU.S.C. § 1988 for those violations covered by the Civil Rights Act.\nDAMAGES\n31.\n9\n\n7:07-cv-05004-JFB-TDT   Doc # 92   Filed: 02/10/09   Page 10 of 11 - Page ID # 338\nPlaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraph 1-30 above as\nthough fully set forth herein. \n32.\nThe acts and omissions of defendants as set forth above have resulted in SPOTTED ELK’s\ndeath and damages to EASTMAN.  By virtue of these damages, EASTMAN is entitled to the\nfollowing damages:\nA. Compensatory damages for the violation of SPOTTED ELK’s rights\nunder the federal and state Constitutions;\nB. Funeral expenses were incurred by EASTMAN following SPOTTED\nELK’s death, which should have been absolutely unnecessary and\nneedless, to the sum of not less than $5,000.00;\nC.

The\nattachment to that e-mail, contained in Exhibit “U,” constitutes the policy component of this\nsettlement.  That would be the component of the settlement that is at issue in this Motion.  The\npayment of $100,000.00, allowance of Mrs. Eastman and a medicine man into the “drunk tank” to\npray and return of Jay Spotted Elk’s belongings is not at issue in this Motion. \n\n7:07-cv-05004-JFB-TDT   Doc # 140   Filed: 05/06/10   Page 2 of 5 - Page ID # 562\n2.\nSince we first made a settlement offer to the defense on January 15, 2010, we have asked for\nsettlement  to  include  both  monetary  and  non-monetary  components.    The  non-monetary\ncomponents include changes to the suicide prevention policies for the Sheridan County Department\nof Corrections.\n3.\nOver the preceding 48 hours, negotiation over the terms of the suicide prevention policies\nhas focused primarily on (1) how the jail will agree to interface with the Suicide Prevention Programs\nof the Pine Ride Oglala and Rosebud tribes; and (2) how Plaintiff may enforce the settlement (to\ninclude COUNTY agreeing to provide an annual compliance report beginning February 2, 2011 until\n2014).  These negotiations took place via e-mail between the undersigned and defense counsel Kris\nCecava.  Policy language was drafted by the undersigned and provided in attachments to e-mails to\nMrs. Cecava; Mrs. Cecava would write back and suggest changes, which the undersigned would\nincorporate into the draft and reattach revised drafts for Mrs. Cecava’s review.\n4.\nRelative to the issue of how the jail would contact the area tribal Suicide Prevention\nPrograms, on May 5, 2010, Mrs. Cecava had agreed that COUNTY “could have local numbers for\nboth the Pine Ridge and Rosebud tribes as by far the majority [of Native American detainees in the\nSheridan County jail] are from one of those two.”  (Evidence Index, Exhibit “N.”) The undersigned\nincorporated that change into a draft proposal which  provided that “the booking desk at the jail will\nkeep the contact information for the Suicide Prevention Program for the Pine Ridge Oglala and\n2\n\n7:07-cv-05004-JFB-TDT   Doc # 140   Filed: 05/06/10   Page 3 of 5 - Page ID # 563\nRosebud tribes” (Evidence Index, Exhibit “R” and attachment), and provided that to Mrs. Cecava.\n5.\nAfter reviewing the attachment to Exhibit “R” at 9:29 on the morning of May 6, Mrs. Cecava\nsuggested changes, but no changes relative to the issue addressed in the immediately preceding\nparagraph – which, to the undersigned, signaled acceptance (particularly since the draft language\naccommodated the request Mrs. Cecava had made the day before).  \n6.\nThe only change Mrs. Cecava proposed was to remove the enforcement provision of the\nproposed policy.  (Evidence Index, Exhibit “S.”)  The undersigned wrote back at 9:35 that removing\nthe enforcement provision was not acceptable.  (Evidence Index, Exhibit “T.”\n7.\nAt 11:37 a.m., Mrs. Cecava wrote that “the enforceability in the first part of the paragraph\nwould remain the same [as what the undersigned had proposed earlier] with the words ‘Mrs. Eastman\nand her attorneys’ replaced with ‘plaintiff.’  If you really want an annual report for four years, I think\nit can be done.  Let’s wrap this up.”  (Evidence Index, Exhibit “T.”)\n8.\nThe undersigned made the change of substituting “plaintiff” for “Mrs. Eastman and her\nattorneys” in the enforcement provision of the proposed policy and sent it to Mrs. Cecava.  (Evidence\nIndex, Exhibit “U.”) The undersigned then contacted her client and confirmed that her client would\naccept this change (the undersigned had communicated all other negotiations over the terms of the\npolicy changes over the preceding days).  At 12:05, the undersigned advised Mrs. Cecava that Mrs.\n3\n\n7:07-cv-05004-JFB-TDT   Doc # 140   Filed: 05/06/10   Page 4 of 5 - Page ID # 564\nEastman had approved the language.  (Evidence Index, Exhibit “V.”)\n9.\nThe undersigned heard nothing from Mrs. Cecava until approximately 4:45, when she was\nadvised that Mrs. Cecava had called and said “there’s no settlement,” or something to that effect.\nAt 5:15, Mrs. Cecava faxed correspondence to the undersigned that materially changed the terms\nof the policy-change component of the settlement.  (Evidence Index, Exhibit “W.”)\n10.\nThe 5:15 fax proposed to eliminate the enforcement portion that had been offered and\naccepted on the morning of May 6.  The 5:15 fax also materially changed the procedure by which\nthe Sheridan County Jail would contact the tribe’s Suicide Prevention Program upon ascertaining\nwhether a suicidal inmate were a member of a Native American tribe, which had been drafted by the\nundersigned on May 5 as an acceptance of Mrs. Cecava’s offer and which Mrs. Cecava never\nproposed to change (consistent with the language being in accordance with her May 5 offer).\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff asks this Court to enforce the settlement as offered in these\nparticulars:\na.  Changes to the Sheridan County Department of Corrections Policy &\nProcedure Manual as set forth in the attachment to the undersigned’s 11:45\na.m. e-mail of May 6, 2010 (Evidence Index, Exhibit “U”);\nb.  Payment of $100,000.00;\nc.  Permission for Mrs. Eastman and a Lakota medicine man to pray in the\n“drunk tank” of the Sheridan County jail; and\nd.  Return of any belongings retained by Sheridan County after Jay Spotted Elk’s\ndeath, to include his belt and any other personal property not yet returned to\nMrs. Eastman.\n4\n\n7:07-cv-05004-JFB-TDT   Doc # 140   Filed: 05/06/10   Page 5 of 5 - Page ID # 565\nARLYN J.

Eastman, Personal Representative of the Estate of Lino Lowell Spotted Elk, Jr.,\nDeceased, Plaintiff in the above-captioned matter, by and through her counsel of record,\nARGUMENT\nI.\nStandard of Review\nOne who attacks a settlement agreement must ear the burden of showing that the contract\nhe made is tainted with invalidity, either by fraud practiced upon him or by a mutual mistake under\nwhich both parties acted.  Brown v. Nationscredit Commercial, 2000 WL 888507 (D. Conn. 2000).\nII.\nTHE PARTIES HAD MUTUALLY ASSENTED TO ALL TERMS AND\nCONDITIONS  BY  12:05  P.M.,  LEAVING  NOTHING  REMAINING\nEXCEPT PHRASING\nIt is well-established that parties are bound to the terms of a contract even though it is not\n\n7:07-cv-05004-JFB-TDT   Doc # 143   Filed: 05/07/10   Page 2 of 7 - Page ID # 641\nsigned (or even written).  Main Line Theatres, Inc. v. Paramount Film Dist. Corp., 298 F.2d 801,\n802-04 (3d Cir. 1962).  The only essential prerequisite for a valid settlement agreement is that the\nparties mutually assent to the terms and conditions of the settlement.  Pugh v. Super Fresh Food\nMkts., Inc., 640 F. Supp. 1306, 1308 (E.D. Pa. 1986).  Moreover, a settlement is still binding even\nif a party has a change of heart between the time of the settlement ot the terms of the settlement and\nthe time that those terms are reduced to writing.  Brown v. Nationscredit Commercial, supra, 2000\nWL 888507 at *2.  Once a settlement is reached, the agreement may not be repudiated by either\nparty.  V’Soske v. Barwick, 404 F.2d 492 (2d Cir. 1968) (agreement enforced against defendant\ndespite failure to agree on several significant terms).  Rather, such an agreement will be summarily\nenforced by the court.\nIn Omega Engineering, Inc. v. Omega, SA, 2004 WL 2191588 (D. Conn. 2004), the United\nStates District Court for the District of Connecticut reviewed a motion to enforce a settlement\nagreement from a trademark dispute: it was presented with the question of whether the parties had\nreached any agreement in the first place.  \nSeveral days before a court-ordered settlement conference, the parties had engaged in\nsettlement discussions between themselves.  The plaintiff had proposed language for a settlement\nagreement on a specific point, that being that the plaintiff would include a reference on its shipping\nboxes and its products to its corporation, for clarity of identification.  The defense counsel had\nresponded that the were “generally in accord on this point,” but suggested an alternative that the\nplaintiff declined to accept.  Id. at *2.  Later in the same day, the defense reformulated its proposal\nto more closely mirror what the plaintiff had originally suggested.  As the court observed, no further\n2\n\n7:07-cv-05004-JFB-TDT   Doc # 143   Filed: 05/07/10   Page 3 of 7 - Page ID # 642\ndiscussions regarding the identification of the “Omega” mark on the plaintiff’s products occurred\nuntil the settlement conference.\nAt the settlement conference, counsel for both sides were accompanied by representatives\nwith authority to settle the case.  The parties came to an agreement that included all material terms,\nand specifically included a provision that related to how the plaintiff would identify itself on its\nproducts.  The language was essentially the same as the language in the defendant’s second written\nproposal.  The parties did not sign the agreement prepared during the settlement conference.  Id. at\n*3.  They did, however, agree that the case had been settled.\nOne day following the settlement conference, the plaintiff signed the settlement agreement.\nThe defense counsel refused to sign it, and sent an e-mail to the plaintiff’s counsel, stating that the\ndefendant wanted the parties to enter into a “side letter” which materially changed the provision of\nthe agreement relating to how the plaintiff would identify its product – the same provision that had\nbeen successfully addressed in the parties’ pre-settlement conference discussions.  Id.  The plaintiff\nrefused to agree to this change, and filed a motion to enforce the settlement.\nThe defense first claimed that the court did not even have jurisdiction to enforce any\nagreement – an argument that the court rejected: “One cannot dispute that the court retains\njurisdiction, prior to the dismissal of a case, to enforce a settlement agreement in a case over which\nit provided.”  Id. at *4.  The court observed that the policy favoring the settlement of disputes, and\nthe avoidance of costs and time-consuming trials, “preserves the integrity of settlement as a\nmeaningful way to resolve legal disputes.”  Id.\nThe defense then argued that there was no settlement because no stipulation of dismissal had\n3\n\n7:07-cv-05004-JFB-TDT   Doc # 143   Filed: 05/07/10   Page 4 of 7 - Page ID # 643\nbeen entered.  The court dismissed this argument as well:\n[T]hat a party files a motion to enforce a settlement agreement means precisely that\nit believes an agreement has been reached and the other party seeks to renege on that\nagreement.\nId. at *5.  The court observed that the plaintiff had sought a continuance to extend the dismissal\ncase originally ordered under the local rules for submitting closing papers – which was more evidence\nto support a finding that the case had settled.1\nThe defense next argued that there was no settlement because the parties were not bound\nby  an  agreement  that  had  not  been  signed  by  both  parties.    The  court  rejected  defense’s\ncharacterization of the settlement as “hastily thrown together,” and observed that the parties had\nspent a day in chambers “meticulously working out the details of the agreement” (just as in this case,\nin which counsel spent two days “meticulously working out the details of [this] agreement”).  Id. at\n*7.  The defense had had “more than a reasonable opportunity” to review the terms – consistent with\nthis case, in which Sheriff Robbins was actually in Mrs. Cecava’s office during a portion of the\nnegotiations over language.  (Evidence Index, Exhibit “N.”)  \nFinally, the defense argued that the motion to enforce the settlement should be denied\nbecause it had “identified and conveyed its disapproval of the agreement almost immediately.”  On\nthis point, the court observed that “the client was present during the negotiations” – as in this case\n– “and participated in the agreement’s development and reduction to writing.”  Id. at *7.  The fact\n1Plaintiff herein would have filed a similar motion had things not “blown up”\nas quickly as they did.  In fact, the undersigned proposed exactly that type of\nmotion to Mrs. Cecava in her May 6, 2010 e-mail sent at 7:55 a.m. (Evidence\nIndex, Exhibit “R”), another provision to which Mrs. Cecava never registered any\nobjection.\n4\n\n7:07-cv-05004-JFB-TDT   Doc # 143   Filed: 05/07/10   Page 5 of 7 - Page ID # 644\nthat the agreement now contained disputed terms was “not persuasive at all” – the court found that\nthe parties had manifested their mutual assent to the terms and conditions of the agreement; and\nthat the agreement was binding and enforceable.\nThe Omega court noted authority for the proposition that a court should refuse to enforce\na settlement agreement if a party fails to show that the parties “mutually assented to all of the\nessential terms and conditions of settlement.”  Id. at *6.  That would apply here, if we failed to show\nthat Defendants and Mrs. Eastman “mutually assented to all of the essential terms and conditions\nof settlement.”  We have not so failed, however.  \nBy 12:05 on May 6, the parties had mutually assented to these essential terms and conditions:\n*  That COUNTY would perform annual training, and after any future suicide\nattempt in the jail would debrief, investigate and document findings, and\nreview suicide prevention policies with its employees.  That provision was\noffered by the defense on May 5, 2010 at 10:51 a.m. (Evidence Index, Exhibit\n“N.”) and accepted by the undersigned on May 6, 2010 at 11:45 a.m.\n(Evidence Index, Exhibit “U,” attachment to e-mail.)\n*  That COUNTY would agree to communicate with the Pine Ridge Oglala and\nRosebud tribal Suicide Prevention Programs, rather than just calling a 1-800\nnational hotline.  That provision was offered by the defense on May 5, 2010\nat 10:51 a.m. (Evidence Index, Exhibit “N”) and accepted by the undersigned\non May 5, 2010 at 11:27 a.m. (Evidence Index, Exhibit “P.”)\n*  That COUNTY would agree to an enforcement provision that would include\nproviding an annual compliance report to Mrs. Eastman.  That provision was\noffered on May 6, 2010 at 11:37 a.m. (Evidence Index, Exhibit “T”) and\naccepted by the undersigned on May 6, 2010 at 12:06 p.m. (Evidence Index,\nExhibit “V.”)\nThe parties had, many days before, agreed to other monetary (payment of $100,000.00) and\nnonmonetary (return of Jay Spotted Elk’s belongings, permission for Mrs. Eastman to pray in the\n“drunk tank”) provisions of settlement; these provisions came into agreement over the course of the\n5\n\n7:07-cv-05004-JFB-TDT   Doc # 143   Filed: 05/07/10   Page 6 of 7 - Page ID # 645\ne-mails submitted in the Evidence Index.\nIf defense counsel had made these offers without authority from her client, that is not grounds\nfor  reneging  on  the  agreement  and,  at  5:15  (Evidence  Index,  Exhibit  “W”),  removing  the\nenforcement provision and substituting “call an 800 number” for the requirement of contacting the\nlocal tribes.  The finding of this Court should follow the Omega court’s finding:\nHaving taken itself out from “under the gun” of imminent trial, [the defense] broke\nits word, reneged on the contract and now attempts to use the contract it broke as\na springboard from which to negotiate an even better deal.  This is what happened\nhere.  It should not be countenanced by a United States court.  Judges must not be\nblind to what others see.\nSee, e.g., Omega Engineering, *10.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the above-stated reasons, Plaintiff asks this Court to enforce the settlement as offered in\nthese particulars:\na.  Changes to the Sheridan County Department of Corrections Policy &\nProcedure Manual as set forth in the attachment to the undersigned’s 11:45\na.m. e-mail of May 6, 2010 (Evidence Index, Exhibit “U”);\nb.

Eastman, Personal Representative of the Estate of Lino Lowell Spotted Elk, Jr.,\nDeceased, Plaintiff in the above-captioned matter, by and through her counsel of record, for her\ncause of action against Defendants, states as follows:\nPARTIES, JURISDICTION AND VENUE\n1.\nArlyn  J.  (LeRoy)  Eastman  (“EASTMAN”)  is  a  resident  of  Rosebud,  South  Dakota.\nDefendant County of Sheridan (“COUNTY”) is a Nebraska political subdivision.  Defendant Levi\nMcKillet (“MCKILLET”) was employed by Defendant COUNTY as a correctional officer/jailer at\nall relevant times, and is liable for his actions in his individual and official capacities.  Defendants\nDOES 1 - 5 are and were employed by Defendant COUNTY as correctional officers, jailers, and/or\nlaw enforcement officers at all relevant times, and are liable for their actions in their individual and\nofficial capacities.  Any and all actions undertaken by any and all of the Defendants constituted\nactions under color of state law.  The damages in this case exceed $75,000.00 in value.\n\nCase: 7:07-cv-05004-JFB-TDT   Document #: 17    Date Filed: 04/24/07   Page 2 of 11\n2.\nThis action is brought pursuant to the provisions of 28 U.S.C. §§1331 and 1333 and 42\nU.S.C. §1983.  The proper venue for this action is the United States District Court for the District\nof Nebraska because the acts and omissions complained of herein occurred in Rushville, Sheridan\nCounty, Nebraska.\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n3.\nOn July 19, 2005, Lino Lowell Spotted Elk (“SPOTTED ELK”), then age 20, was arrested\nin Rushville, Sheridan County, Nebraska on an outstanding warrant, and was taken to the Sheridan\nCounty Jail in Rushville.  \n4.\nCOUNTY agents and employees booked SPOTTED ELK into the jail, with the expectation\nthat SPOTTED ELK would stay in the jail at least until a bond hearing could be convened and\npotentially until the disposition of the charge for which SPOTTED ELK had an outstanding warrant.\nNevertheless, COUNTY agents and employees did not provide SPOTTED ELK with a jail uniform\nand remove SPOTTED ELK’s access to his own clothing, including his belt.\n5.\nCOUNTY  agents  and  employees,  including  MCKILLET,  failed  to  inquire  regarding\nSPOTTED ELK’s mental health and suicidality during the intake/booking process in violation of the\nNebraska Jail Standards, despite that SPOTTED ELK exhibited objective signs of clinically-\ndiagnosable and treatable mental illness and suicidality.  SPOTTED ELK talked of suicide and was\n2\n\nCase: 7:07-cv-05004-JFB-TDT   Document #: 17    Date Filed: 04/24/07   Page 3 of 11\nintoxicated to the point at which his reasoning and coping skills were impaired, which are indicators\nfor mental health care triggering a civil and constitutional duty to protect SPOTTED ELK on the\npart of Defendants.  From SPOTTED ELK’s statements and based on the Nebraska Jail Standards’\nrequirements for assessing mental health of prisoners upon intake, Defendants knew or should have\nknown that SPOTTED ELK was mentally ill and suicidal.   \n6.\nCOUNTY agents and employees thereafter disregarded and were deliberately indifferent to\nwarning signs in SPOTTED ELK’s words and behavior of mental illness and suicidality.  The need\nfor medical care for SPOTTED ELK was so obvious that a trained jail person would or should\nrecognize it.\n7.\nOther inmates heard noise and struggling in SPOTTED ELK’s cell and called for help, but\nwere ignored.  Approximately one hour after his arrest, SPOTTED ELK was found hanging from his\nown belt in his cell.  At the time of his death, SPOTTED ELK also had head contusions and visible\ninjuries that he did not have before his arrest.\n8.\nSuicide is a known risk to detainees in any detention center.  The Nebraska Jail Standards\nrequire that jails train employees, and that employees follow such training, to assess detainees for\nmental health and suicidality upon booking into the jail.  Notwithstanding, MCKILLET and DOES\n1-5 did not assess SPOTTED ELK for mental health and suicidality and failed to respond to signs\nthat he was mentally ill and suicidal, or to calls for help from other inmates who heard the noise and\n3\n\nCase: 7:07-cv-05004-JFB-TDT   Document #: 17    Date Filed: 04/24/07   Page 4 of 11\nstruggling in SPOTTED ELK’s cell.  \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 – ALL DEFENDANTS\n8.\nEASTMAN incorporates Paragraphs 1-7 above as if fully set forth herein.\n9.\nSPOTTED ELK had a right under the Constitution of the United States to be free from\nexcessive punishment, from all punishment (given that he was a pretrial detainee), and from\nindifference to his medical needs, as well as a right to due process and equal protection, by employees\nof governmental entities.\n10.\nAt all times relevant to this Complaint, MCKILLET and DOES 1-10 were acting under color\nof law – under the constitutions, statutes, administrative rules, customs, policies and usages of the\nCounty of Sheridan, State of Nebraska and the United States – and had assumed the responsibilities,\nactivities, and rights involved in exercising their roles as members of COUNTY’s professional staff.\n11.\nWhen SPOTTED ELK was under Defendants’ supervision and custody, Defendants acted\nwith deliberate indifference to SPOTTED ELK’s known and recognized constitutional and legal\nrights to due process, equal protection and bodily integrity and to be free from excessive punishment\nand indifference to his medical needs.  Defendants actively participated in the deprivation of\n4\n\nCase: 7:07-cv-05004-JFB-TDT   Document #: 17    Date Filed: 04/24/07   Page 5 of 11\nSPOTTED ELK’s constitutional rights by causing SPOTTED ELK’s injuries and suicide.\n12.\nDefendants’ conduct, within his duties as a member of COUNTY’s professional staff, under\ncolor of state law, deprived SPOTTED ELK of rights, privileges and immunities secured by the\nUnited States Constitution.  Particularly, SPOTTED ELK was deprived of his constitutional liberty\ninterest in due process, equal protection and bodily integrity and in freedom from excessive\npunishment and indifference to his medical needs.  \n13.\nAs a result of Defendants’ deprivation of SPOTTED ELK’s constitutional liberty interests\ndescribed above, EASTMAN has incurred damages. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 – DEFENDANT COUNTY\n14.\nEASTMAN incorporates paragraphs 1-13 above as if fully set forth herein.\nCount I – Policy or custom of ignoring reports\n15.\nCOUNTY had a special relationship with SPOTTED ELK by virtue of the fact that\nCOUNTY had custody and control over SPOTTED ELK, such that SPOTTED ELK could not care\nfor his own medical needs while incarcerated.  In so doing, COUNTY had a duty to exercise\nreasonable care in the selection, training, assignment, supervision and retention of its professional\nstaff, including MCKILLET and DOES.  \n5\n\nCase: 7:07-cv-05004-JFB-TDT   Document #: 17    Date Filed: 04/24/07   Page 6 of 11\n16.\nBy those failures set forth above, COUNTY acted with deliberate indifference to a known\nrisk of constitutional deprivation to SPOTTED ELK and other detainees incarcerated in the\nSheridan County Jail.   COUNTY thus acted according to a persistent, widespread practice of jail\nemployees, which is so common and well-settled as to constitute a custom fairly representing\nmunicipal policy of providing inadequate assessment of and care for suicidal detainees.  \n17.\nAs a result of COUNTY’s deliberate indifference to the risk of deprivation of SPOTTED\nELK’s constitutional liberty interests, EASTMAN incurred damages as set forth below.\n18.\nSPOTTED ELK could not  have reasonably discovered that COUNTY had a custom or\npractice of tolerating misconduct by employees, and of failing to provide adequate training and\nstaffing  to  implement  reasonable  suicide  prevention  practices,  because  such  knowledge  was\nspecifically held by officers and agents of COUNTY.\nCount II – Failure to train\n19.\nAt all times relevant to this Complaint, COUNTY had a custom or practice of failing to train\nits employees to be observant of and act upon signs and indications of suicidality in detainees.\nCOUNTY  failed  to  implement  training  materials  and  programs  related  to  recognizing  and\nunderstanding patterns of mental illness and suicide.  In particular, COUNTY failed to train its\nemployees to recognize the dangers and warning signs of suicide..\n6\n\nCase: 7:07-cv-05004-JFB-TDT   Document #: 17    Date Filed: 04/24/07   Page 7 of 11\n20.\nBy failing to train its employees to recognize warning signs and dangers of mental illness and\nsuicidality  in  detainees,  COUNTY  acted  with  deliberate  indifference  to  a  known  risk  of\nconstitutional deprivation to SPOTTED ELK and other detainees.\n21.\nAs a result of COUNTY’s deliberate indifference to the risk of deprivation of SPOTTED\nELK’s constitutional liberty interests set forth above, EASTMAN has incurred damages as set forth\nbelow.\nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION\nNEGLIGENT SUPERVISION AND RETENTION BY EPSD\n22.\nPlaintiff incorporates paragraphs 1-21 above as if fully set forth herein.\n23.\nThe wrongful death of SPOTTED ELK was proximately caused by COUNTY in one or more\nof the following particulars:\na. Failure to adequately assess SPOTTED ELK for mental illness and suicidality upon\nbooking SPOTTED ELK into the jail;\nb. Failure to adequately monitor and obtain mental health assistance for SPOTTED\nELK in the time between his admission to the jail and his death;\nc. Failure to train and supervise employees and agents in suicide assessment and suicide\nprevention,  and  to  provide  adequate  staffing  to  carry  out  reasonable  suicide\nassessment and prevention procedures;\nd. Failure to follow Defendant’s own procedures for suicide prevention and assessment;\n7\n\nCase: 7:07-cv-05004-JFB-TDT   Document #: 17    Date Filed: 04/24/07   Page 8 of 11\ne. Failure to respond reasonably to sounds and signs of distress by SPOTTED ELK in\nhis cell.\nf.\n24.\nAs a result of COUNTY’s negligent supervision and training of its professional staff and\nagents, EASTMAN has incurred damages as set forth below.\n25.\nOn July 17, 2006, EASTMAN submitted a Notice of Administrative Claim to the Sheridan\nCounty Commissioners, the Sheridan County Clerk, the Sheridan County Attorney, the Sheridan\nCounty Sheriff and the Sheridan County Jail Administrator.  More than six months have passed with\nno response from Defendants.  Accordingly, on February 8, 2007, Plaintiff withdrew her claim.\nPUNITIVE DAMAGES\n26.\nPlaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraph 1-25 above as\nthough fully set fourth herein.  \n27.\nIn addition to compensatory damages, EASTMAN hereby makes a claim for punitive\ndamages against defendants in an amount to be proven at trial for the willful and wanton acts and\nomissions of Defendants, to include violation of SPOTTED ELK’s civil rights, as alleged herein.  The\nacts and omissions of Defendants in this case were so gross and culpable in nature that they\nconstitute reckless indifference and wanton disregard for the law and for the lives and safety of\nothers, including SPOTTED ELK.  Defendants committed the acts and omissions alleged herein and\nsubjected SPOTTED ELK to improper treatment that caused SPOTTED ELK to suffer psychological\n8\n\nCase: 7:07-cv-05004-JFB-TDT   Document #: 17    Date Filed: 04/24/07   Page 9 of 11\nand psychiatric harm so severe that no person should be expected to endure it.  Defendants’ actions\nshould be punished, and an example should be made so that these actions and omissions are not\nrepeated.\n28.\nThe recovery of punitive damages is permitted under the federal civil rights statutes for\nreckless and callous indifference to the federally protected rights of others, and is thus appropriate\nin this case.  This instance of reckless and callous  indifference to SPOTTED ELK’s safety and\nconstitutional rights should be punished through the imposition of punitive damages so as to make\nan example of conduct that will not be tolerated.\nATTORNEY’S FEES\n29.\n Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations contained in 1-28 above as though fully\nset forth herein.\n30.\nAs a result of defendants’ actions as alleged herein, EASTMAN has been required to retain\nthe services of attorneys and are entitled to a reasonable amount for attorney’s fee pursuant to 42\nU.S.C. § 1988 for those violations covered by the Civil Rights Act.\nDAMAGES\n31.\n9\n\nCase: 7:07-cv-05004-JFB-TDT   Document #: 17    Date Filed: 04/24/07   Page 10 of 11\nPlaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraph 1-30 above as\nthough fully set forth herein. \n32.\nThe acts and omissions of defendants as set forth above have resulted in SPOTTED ELK’s\ndeath and damages to EASTMAN.  By virtue of these damages, EASTMAN is entitled to the\nfollowing damages:\nA. Compensatory damages for the violation of SPOTTED ELK’s rights\nunder the federal and state Constitutions;\nB. Funeral expenses were incurred by EASTMAN following SPOTTED\nELK’s death, which should have been absolutely unnecessary and\nneedless, to the sum of not less than $5,000.00;\nC. Loss of society and companionship in such amounts as are allowable\nby law;\nD. Punitive damages to punish and deter the reprehensible conduct\nalleged in this Complaint; \nE. Attorney’s fees; and\nF. The costs of this action and such other and further relief as this Court\ndeems equitable and proper. \n33.\nAs a result of the negligent acts and omissions of Defendant described herein, SPOTTED\nELK also sustained injuries that caused him pain, suffering, and mental anguish from the time that\nhe was booked into the jail until his death.\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays for judgment against the defendants as follows:\nA. Plaintiff prays for damages in an amount which will fairly and justly compensate them\n10\n\nCase: 7:07-cv-05004-JFB-TDT   Document #: 17    Date Filed: 04/24/07   Page 11 of 11\nfor the violation of their civil rights, their pain and suffering and other consequential\ndamages flowing from the violations and torts set forth herein;\nB.
