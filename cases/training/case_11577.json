The plaintiff, represented by private counsel, asked the court for injunctive relief, claiming that ADHS was not in compliance with the Medicaid Act.  Specifically, Plaintiff claimed that her rights were violated when ADHS refused to provide her father with an enrollment application for community-based services and instead placed her on a waitlist for an indefinite time period.</p><p>Arkansas participates in Medicaid, and ADHS is the state agency charged with the administration of the Medicaid program in Arkansas.  Arkansas provides services for developmentally disabled individuals in intermediate care facilities; alternatively, Arkansas also chose to provide home and community based services for developmentally disabled individuals (known as the Alternative Community Services Medicaid Waiver Program, or \"ACS\").</p><p>Plaintiff was a five-year-old girl with developmental and physical disabilities resulting from Down syndrome.  Plaintiff's father wished to enroll her in the ACS program and requested an enrollment application in November of 2002; instead of providing an application, ADHS required Plaintiff to complete a client choice form.  ADHS put Plaintiff on a wait list at number 2285 for an indefinite period of time even though there were almost 1,000 empty slots under the ACS program.  Plaintiff alleged that ADHS had taken similar actions in response to other requests for ACS services.</p><p>Defendants filed an answer on July 17, 2003.</p><p>During a hearing held on August 14, 2003, Defendants agreed to provide Plaintiff with an application for ACS services.  Because that was the primary relief sought by Plaintiff in her Complaint, the Court (Judge G. Thomas Eisele) dismissed the case without prejudice and stated that it considered Plaintiff to be a prevailing party.</p><p>On September 22, 2003, the Court issued an order awarding attorney's fees and costs.  Rejecting Plaintiff's request for more than $26,000 because it was excessive in light of the relief obtained, the Court awarded Plaintiff $16,500 in attorney's fees, and $150 in costs.</p><p>There has been no further action in the case, and it has been closed.</p><p></p>",

Introduction \nThis  case  concerns  the  Developmental  Disabilities  Alternative  Community \nServices Medicaid Waiver (\"A CS waiver\") administered by the Arkansas Department of \nHuman Services (\"ADHS\").  Plaintiff, already a Medicaid recipient, seeks a preliminary \ninjunction requiring ADHS to immediately accept her ACS waiver application, determine \nher eligibility  for  ACS  waiver  services,  and,  if she  is  eligible,  provide  ACS  waiver \nservices.  She  does  not  allege  that  the  full  array  of Medicaid  services  falls  short of \nmeeting her health care needs. Nor does she allege what, if any, ACS waiver services she \nmust have to avoid irreparable injury. \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 5     Filed 07/07/2003     Page 2 of 14 \nII. Preliminary Injunction Standard \nTo be entitled to a preliminary injunction, the party seeking the injunction must \nestablish each of the following four requirements: \n(1) The threat of irreparable harm to the moving party; \n(2) The balance between the threat of irreparable harm and \nany injury that granting the injunction would inflict on the \nother parties; \n(3) The likelihood that the moving party will succeed on \nthe merits; and \n(4)  The  impact  that  granting  the  preliminary  injunction \nwould have on the public interest. \nDataphase Systems,  Inc.  v.  C L Systems,  Inc.,  640 F.2d  109,  113 (8th  Cir.  1981).  The \ndecision to grant a preliminary injunction is discretionary with the district court and is an \nextraordinary remedy.  As such, it should only be granted if the moving party (plaintiff) \nhas clearly carried the burden of persuasion on all four Dataphase requirements. United \nInd.  Corp.  v.  Clorox Co.,  140 F.3d 1175 (8th Cir.  1998).  Simply put, plaintiff cannot \nestablish a threat of irreparable harm before a decision on the merits is reached, nor can \nshe demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits. \nIII. The Medicaid Program \nMedicaid is an entitlement program administered by the states but jointly \nfinanced by the federal and state governments. \n2 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 5     Filed 07/07/2003     Page 3 of 14 \nThe Medicaid program was created in 1965 and is designed to \nfurnish medical assistance to persons \"whose income and resources are \ninsufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services.\" 42 U.S.C. § \n1396.  As the nation's largest means-tested health care financing \nprogram, its importance to the nation's health care system cannot be \noverstated. \nAshley County Med.  Ctr. v.  Thompson, 205 F. Supp.2d 1026, 1029 (E.D. Ark. 2002). \nThe Medicaid program is administered by the states under \nMedicaid state plans approved by the Secretary of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services (HHS).  Each state is required to establish a \nmedical assistance plan (known as the \"State Plan\") which must describe \neligibility standards, the scope of benefits, reimbursement methodologies \nand certain other details of that state's Medicaid program. \nAshley County Med.  Ctr., 205 F. Supp. at 1030. \n\"Medicaid programs do not guarantee that each recipient will receive that level of \nhealth care precisely tailored to his or her needs.\"  Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 207, \n303 (1985). \nIV. EPSDT \nUnder the Early and Periodic Diagnosis, Screening, and Treatment (\"EPSDT\") \nMedicaid provisions, participating states must provide comprehensive benefits for \nMedicaid eligible persons under age twenty-one. \n[T]he State Plan must include the provision of EPSDT services as \nthose services are defined in § 1396d (r).  See §§ 1396a (a)(10)(A), 1396d \n(a)(4)(B); see also 1396a (a)(43).  Section 1396d (r) lists in detail the \nscreening services, vision services, dental services, and hearing services \nthat the State Plan must expressly include, but with regard to treatment \nservices, it states that EPSDT means \"[s]uch other necessary health care, \ndiagnostic services, treatment, and other measures described in subsection \n(a) of this section to correct or ameliorate defects and physical and mental \nillnesses and conditions discovered by the screening services, whether or \nnot such services are covered under the State plan.  42 U.S.C. § 1396d \n(r)(5). \n3 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 5     Filed 07/07/2003     Page 4 of 14 \nPedialric Specially Care v. Arkansas Dep 'I ofH  uman Servs., 293 F.3d 472, 480 (8th Cir. \n2002). \nV. The ACS Waiver \nADHS created ACS services via a Medicaid waiver approved by the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services under the provisions of 42 U.S.c. § 1396n (c) (Section 1915 \n(c) of the Social Security Act).  Section 1915 (c) permits State Medicaid Plans to: \nInclude as \"medical assistance\" under such plan payment for part or all of \nthe cost of home or community-based services (other than room and \nboard) approved by the Secretary which are provided pursuant to a written \nplan of care to individuals with respect to whom there has been a \ndetermination that but for the provision of such services the individuals \nwould require the level of care provided in a hospital or a nursing facility \nor intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded the cost of which \ncould be reimbursed under the State plan. \nWaivers are not permanent.  Initial waiver approval cannot exceed three years, and \nthereafter, waivers are limited to additional five-year periods.  42 U.S.C. § 1396n (c)(3). \nWaiver services must be cost neutral.  See, 42 U.S.C. § 1396n (c)(2)(D)  (average per \ncapita waiver cost cannot exceed average per capita institutional cost). \nStates must impose an upper limit on the number of persons serviced under the \nACS waiver: \nThe State must indicate the number of un duplicated beneficiaries to which \nit intends to provide waiver services....  The number will constitute a \nlimit on the size of the waiver unless the Secretary [of the United States \nDepartment of Health and Human Services] approves a greater number of \nwaiver participants in a waiver amendment. \n42 C.F.R. § 441.303 (f)(6).  This number \"becomes the 'population limit' on the [waiver] \nservices.\"  Makin ex reI. Russell v.  Hawaii, 114 F. Supp. 2d 1017,1028 (D. Hi. I 999).  42 \n4 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 5     Filed 07/07/2003     Page 5 of 14 \n• \nU.S.c. § 1396n (c)(10) requires at least 200 individuals be served.  The ACS waiver is \nlimited to 3,067 persons'. \nIn addition to the comprehensive array of services defined as medical assistance \nin 42 V.S.c. § 1396d (a)(I)-(27), the ACS waiver provides for the following relevant \n.  2 \nservices: \n(I) Supportive Living Services: assistance with acquisition, retention, or \nimprovement in skills related to activities of daily living, such as personal grooming and \ncleanliness, bed making and household chores, eating and the preparation of food, and the \nsocial and adaptive skills necessary to enable the individual to reside in a non-\ninstitutional setting.  Supportive living services payments are not made to family \nmembers or for routine care and supervision which would be expected to be provided by \na family or group home provider.  See, Exhibit A, pp. 42, 43. \n(2) Environmental accessibility adaptations: physical adaptations to the home \nsuch as ramps and grab bars.  See, Exhibit A, p. 49. \n(3) Personal emergency response portable electronic systems.  See, Exhibit A, p. \n69. \n(4) Most consultation services described in Exhibit A on p. 71. \n(5) Fees for activities that compliment and reinforce community living.  See, \nExhibit A, p. 78. \nA copy of the ACS waiver is attached as exhibit \"A.\" \nI \n2 The list excludes services such as prevocational employment services, supported employment services, \nand transitional expenses to move out of an institution or prevent the need to return to an institution. \n5 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 5     Filed 07/07/2003     Page 6 of 14 \n(6) Some waiver coordination services, e.g., worker coordination, planning input \ninto the plan of care, assuring timely submission of behavior reports, records review, and \nfiscal intermediary services. \nPlaintiff has not alleged that she is in need of, or would be entitled to any of these \nACS waiver services.  Nor has plaintiff alleged that she will be irreparably harmed if she \ndoes not immediately receive these services at public expense. \nThe complaint acknowledges that there are a maximum number of \"slots\" that the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services has approved for the ACS waiver.  See, \ncomplaint, ~~ 23,30, and 44.  A total of3,067 slots for unduplicated individuals is \napproved. See, Exhibit A, p. 106.  However, the allegations in the complaint regarding \nthe number of vacant slots are incorrect.  As of June 30, 2003, there were 2,665 \nunduplicated individuals receiving waiver services.  Theoretically this leaves 402 slots \navailable, but in practice, turnover would make it impossible to keep every slot filled \nevery day.  Plaintiff is number 2,255 on the waiting list. \nVI.  Plaintiff's Medicaid Coverage \nPlaintiffs financial eligibility for Medicaid normally would be determined by \nconsidering her family's income and resources.  Using those tests plaintiff would not be \nMedicaid eligible.  Medicaid is available to plaintiff because Arkansas sought and \nobtained approval for a Medicaid waiver, referred to by plaintiff as the TEFRA waiver, \nthat allows ADHS to make plaintiff Medicaid eligible while disregarding her parents' \nincome and resources.  The waiver provides for a co-pay, the amount of which is based \non parental income and determined by reference to a sliding scale.  See, Exhibit B. \nHaving become Medicaid eligible, plaintiff enjoys the full array of Medicaid care \n6 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 5     Filed 07/07/2003     Page 7 of 14 \nfurnished under EPSDT.  In addition, plaintiff has private health care coverage and may \nlook to her parents to provide needed care.  As a result, it is unlikely·- and plaintiff has \nnot alleged - that ACS waiver services are necessary for her to obtain any medically \nnecessary care. \nVII. Discussion \n(a) Lack of Irreparable Harm \nPlaintiff must prove that she will suffer irreparable harm before the trial on the \nmerits if she does not receive ACS waiver services to which she has an enforceable \nentitlement.  If ADHS eligibility procedures will cause plaintiff no injury during the \ninterim between the filing of the motion for preliminary inj unction and the trial on the \nmerits, then there is no basis to conclude that plaintiff will be irreparably harmed. \nThere is no irreparable harm because there are no available waiver services to \nwhich plaintiff is entitled.  This can be illustrated by assuming, for the sake of discussion, \nthat if ADHS determined plaintiffs eligibility today, plaintiff: (I) would be eligible for \nthe ACS waiver program; and (2) would qualify for one or more ACS waiver services \nthat are not otherwise covered under EPSDT.  Even if ADHS immediately fills every \nvacant ACS waiver slot, 1,852 other slots must become available before plaintiff can be \nserved).  That can happen in only two ways: (I) present recipients terminate their ACS \nwaiver services; and (2) ACS waiver enrollees that are ahead of plaintiff on the \nenrollment list may ultimately be determined ineligible \nThus, there is no available waiver slot, nor is it likely that a slot will become \navailable anytime soon.  As a result, plaintiff suffers no harm due to the status of her \n) 2,254 persons ahead of plaintiff minus the 402 vacaot slots equals 1,852. \n7 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 5     Filed 07/07/2003     Page 8 of 14 \nACS waiver enrollment and eligibility determination, and certainly suffers no immediate \nor irreparable harm that must be remedied via preliminary injunction. \n(b) Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nPlaintiff must establish standing in a case or controversy under Article III of the \nUnited States Constitution.  Lujan v.  Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992). \nStanding has three elements.  First, plaintiff must sustain an invasion of a legally \nprotected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized; (b) actual or imminent as \nopposed to conjectural or hypothetical.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560.  Second, the injury must \nbe caused by the defendant.  ld.  Third, it must be likely, not speculative, that the injury \nwill be redressed by a favorable decision.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  Plaintiff must support \nthe allegations necessary for standing with \"competent proof.\"  McNutt v.  General \nAcceptance Corp., 298 U.S. 178, 189 (1936). \nPlaintiff brought her claims under 42 U.S.c. § 1983 to enforce Spending Clause \nlegislation.  Under its spending power, Congress may attach \"conditions on the receipt of \nfederal funds [requiring] compliance by the recipient with federal statutory and \nadministrative directives.\" South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 206 (1987) (quotation \nomitted).  The Spending Clause does not authorize mandatory legislation.  Rather, \ncompliance with Spending Clause legislation is voluntary.  \"States are given the choice of \ncomplying with the conditions set forth in the Act or forgoing the benefits offederal \nfunding.\"  Pennhurst State School and Hasp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, II (1981). \nPlaintiffs standing hinges on the assertion that certain Medicaid provisions confer \nlegally enforceable rights upon her.  Plaintifflacks standing if the statutes she relie, upon \ndo not confer enforceable rights.  Similarly, plaintiffs standing is prudentially limited if \n8 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 5     Filed 07/07/2003     Page 9 of 14 \nher alleged injury falls outside the \"zone of interests\" protected by the statute.  Simon v. \nE. Kentucky Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 39 n. 19 (1976). \nThe test to determine if a federal statute creates enforceable rights has evolved \nfrom Golden State Transit Corp. v. City 0/ Los Angeles, 493 U.S. 103 (1989) through \nBlessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329 (1997) to Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273 \n(2002).  Gonzaga emphasizes that Congress must express a clear and unambiguous intent \nto confer individual rights.  536 U.S. at 288.  To create enforceable individual rights the \nstatute \"must be 'phrased in tenns of the persons benefited.'\"  536 U.S. at 284, quoting \nCannon v.  Univ.  o/Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 692 n. 13 (1979).  Statutory provisions that \nfocus on \"the aggregate services provided by the State, rather than 'the needs of any \nparticular person'\"  confer no individualized enforceable rights.  536 U.S. at 288, quoting \nBlessing, 520 U.S. at 343. \nAccordingly, plaintiff must establish that the Medicaid statute authorizing the \nACS waiver: (I) establishes plaintiff s individual entitlement to waiver services; and (2) \nfocuses on the needs of plaintiff rather than the aggregate services provided by the state. \nThe first issue - entitlement to waiver services - is easily disposed of because Medicaid \nexplicitly authorizes an upper limit on the number of participants in waiver programs. \nSee, Makin ex rei Russell v.  Hawaii, 114 F.Supp. 2d 1017, 1028 (D. Haw. 1999): \nIn sum, while the Medicaid Act requires a state to offer feasible \nalternatives available under the waiver to all eligible individuals, the \nHCBS-MR program is not \"available\" under the statute when the slots \navailable under the \"popUlation limit\" have been filled.  Thus, the State of \nHawaii is in compliance with the Medicaid statute even if there are over \n750 \"eligible\" individuals on the HCBS-MR wait list so long as there is \nother appropriate treatment available to them under the Medicaid program. \nThe HCFA Secretary approved the State's \"popUlation limit\" for the \nHCBS-MR program and nothing in the statute requires the State to \nprovide HCBS-MR services beyond the limit. \n9 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 5     Filed 07/07/2003     Page 10 of 14 \nAs detennined above, Defendants did not violate Section 1396a \n(a)(8) of the Medicaid Act by failing to provide all Plaintiffs with HCBS \nMR services because the State is only required, under the provision, to \nprovide available \"medical assistance\" with reasonable promptness. \nFurther, the HCBS-MR services are not \"available\" if the \"population \nlimits\" are reached when the eligible individual requests them. \nPlaintiffs attempt to use case law to show that lack of resources \nand funds are not an excuse for failing to provide statutory entitlements. \nThe court agrees with this since a state must comply with federal \nconditions on federal funds.  However, as Defendants correctly argue, \nPlaintiffs have no entitlement to the HCBS-MR services under the statute \nunless there are open slots within the \"population limits\" that can be filled. \nClearly, in this case, there are not enough slots available to provide \nHCBS-MR services to the entire Plaintiffs' class. \nMakin ex reI. Russell v.  Hawaii, 114 F. Supp. 2d at 1030. \nDefendants have not violated the \"reasonable promptness\" \nprovision by maintaining wait lists for HCBS-MR programs.  Under the \nstatute, the State is only required to provide services for the number of \nindividuals approved by the HCF A, or the State legislature.  This is \nparticularly true since there is space available in the ICF/MR facilities that \nprovides Plaintiffs with possible alternative treatment. \nMakin ex reI. Russell v. Hawaii, 114 F. Supp. 2d at 1031. \nGiven the upper limit on the number of persons to be served, it is impossible to \nconclude either that the statute authorizing the waiver was intended to confer individual \nrights on the plaintiff, or that plaintiff's interest in receiving waiver services fall within \nthe zone of protection of the Medicaid statute.  A population limit is not a right conferred \non an individual: it is a limitation on the aggregate services provided by the state. \nBecause the provision concerns aggregate services, it fits neatly within the Gonzaga \nholding that such provisions confer no individualized enforceable rights.  Gonzaga Univ. \nv.  Doe, 536 U.S. at 288. \nThe conclusion that Congress conferred no individual rights by pennitting \nwaivers is further bolstered by the fact that all waivers are of finite duration. 42 U.S.C. § \n10 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 5     Filed 07/07/2003     Page 11 of 14 \n1396n (c)(3).  The automatic termination of a waiver - subject to extension - cannot be \nreconciled with the contention that the waiver was intended to create an enforceable \nfederal right in the beneficiaries. \nFurthermore,  \"Section 1983 only provides a remedy for violations of rights \nexpressly secured by federal statutes or the Constitution.  Kurtz v.  City ofS hrewsbury, \n245 FJd 753, 758 (8th Cir. 2001).  There is no constitutional right to Medicaid services. \nMaher v.  Roe, 432 U.S. 464 (1977).  Federal regulations cannot create enforceable \nMedicaid rights.  Harris v. James, 127 F.3d 993 (11th Cir. 1997).  Therefore, any \nenforceable Medicaid mandate must appear in the Medicaid statute. \nACS waiver services were not created by Congress, or even by federal regulation, \nbut instead by the state's waiver document.  ACS waiver services are not mandated by \nthe Medicaid statute, but instead are a permitted exception to the Medicaid statute.  It is \ntherefore impossible to construe ACS waiver services as a federal right, let alone the sort \nof clear and unmistakable right required by Gonzaga.  It necessarily follows that plaintiff \nhas no enforceable entitlement to ACS waiver services. \nIn any case, an eligibility determination made today would not benefit the \nplaintiff because that determination will not establish plaintiffs eligibility at the time an \nACS waiver slot becomes available.  A new eligibility determination will be required.  In \nthe meantime, plaintiff will not be prejudiced because she submitted an ACS waiver \nenrollment that guarantees her consideration for ACS waiver services without regard to \nher present eligibility status.  In other words, plaintiff will be no better off if determined \neligible today, but could be worse off if determined ineligible and deprived of her \nposition on the ACS waiver enrollment list. \nII \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 5     Filed 07/07/2003     Page 12 of 14 \nFinally, given that there are 2,254 persons awaiting 402 vacant ACS waiver slots, \nthere is no basis to conclude that the alleged injury can be redressed by a favorable \ndecision unless the Court orders that plaintiff be placed in line ahead of other persons \nsimilarly situated.  Similarly, a preliminary injunction will not redress plaintiffs alleged \ninjury because plaintiffs eligibility status and receipt of ACS waiver services must be \ncontemporaneous. \nConclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, defendants respectfully ask that the motion for \npreliminary injunction be denied. \nRespectfully submitted, \nMIKE BEEBE \nAttorney General \n/~  L/ /J  :f \nBy:  /  -<4 ~-. {; \nMARK A.

CASE NO. 4:03-CV-00493 GTE \nARKANSAS DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN \nSERVICES, et al.  DEFENDANTS \nORDER AWARDING ATTORNEY'S FEES & COSTS \nBefore the Court is Plaintiff s Motion for Costs and Attorney's Fees.  Counsel for \nPlaintiff seeks an award of costs in the amount of$564.18 and attorney's fees in the amount of \n$26,493.00.  Defendants object to the requested costs and claim the attorney's fee request is \nexcessive.  For the reasons stated below, the Court awards attorney's fees in the amount of \n$16,500.00 and costs in the amount of$150.00. \nATTORNEY'S FEES \nAttached to Plaintiffs motion is a billing statement supporting the fee request of \n$26,493.00.  Plaintiff was represented in this litigation by the Little Rock office of the law firm \nof Armstrong Allen, PLLC, a regional law firm which also has offices in Memphis and Jackson, \nTennessee, and Jackson, Mississippi.  The case file was opened in November of 2002.  The \nlawsuit was filed in June 25, 2003.  A motion for preliminary injunction was filed with the \ncomplaint.  After substantial briefing on the issues presented, including a reply brief and a sur-\nI \nA072A \n(Rev.8182) \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE   Document 16    Filed 09/22/03   Page 2 of 6\nreply brief, the case came before the Court for a hearing on August 14,2003. \nDuring the hearing, Defendants agreed to provide Plaintiff Tessa G. with an application \nfor ACS Waiver services.  As the Court noted during the hearing, this was the primary relief \nsought in the complaint and motion for preliminary relief  For that reason, the Court considered \nPlaintiff a prevailing party. \nDefendants contend that it is unreasonable to permit a recovery for 177 lawyer hours.  For \ncause, Defendants point to the short lifespan of this case.  Plaintiff counters that the case \npresented a complex and novel legal situation and that the time spent investigating the claim, \nresearching the law, and preparing the case was necessary. \nDespite the short duration of the case, it was not a simple case.  Defendant raised in the \nbriefing - and lost - substantial questions concerning standing and whether Plaintiff had \nenforceable rights under § 1983.  Plaintiff filed a thirty-page reply brief in further support of her \nposition. \nPlaintiff s counsel, Martin Bowen, was very prepared during the hearing.  He \ndemonstrated a mastery of the applicable law and relevant facts and was able to answer questions \nput f0l1h by the Court.  His advocacy greatly assisted the Court in understanding the issues \npresented and  likely contributed to the Defendants' last minute determination not to challenge \nthe case on the merits.  Moreover, Plaintiff was prepared to present the testimony of Cynthia \nAlberding, an ACS specialist, as an expert witness. The Court appreciates Plaintiffs counsel \nthorough preparedness in presenting the case. \nSome of the fee request consists of research done in anticipation of filing the lawsuit, \nwhich began some seven months prior to its filing.  The Court cannot fault counsel for \n2 \nA072A \n(Rev.B/B2) \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE   Document 16    Filed 09/22/03   Page 3 of 6\n, \nconducting a full and thorough inquiry before filing a complaint.  The Court further \nacknowledges that this area of the law is complex.  Defendant's argument that the action hinged \non \"only 43 words found in 42 U.S.C. § 1396(a)(8),\" greatly oversimplifies the issue, the \neffective presentation of which required an understanding of the complex :md bureaucratic \ninterplay between the federal and state governments in the area of Medicaid services. \nThe Court is required to assess the reasonableness of the fee in relation to the result \nobtained.  Although the Complaint sought broader relief than that which was ultimately obtained, \nPlaintiff s claims involved a common core of facts, making it difficult to view the lawsuit as a \nseries of discrete claims.  In such cases, the Supreme Court has instructed that, in awarding fees, \nthe court \"must focus on the significance of the overall relief obtained by the plaintiff in relation \nto the hours reasonably expended on the litigation.\"  Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 435 \n(1983).  The Court is further guided by the principle that legal \"services that were redundant, \ninefficient, or simply unnecessary are not compensable.\" Jenkins by Jenkins v. State ofM  o., 127 \nF.3d 709, 716 (8th Cir. 1997). \nThus, the Court is called upon to determine the amount of attorney\" s fees which would \nreasonably compensate Plaintiffs counsel for prevailing in this matter.  The overall fee request \ndoes appear excessive in view of the narrowness of the issue ultimately decided.  After \nconsidering the fee petition, supporting affidavits and all relevant factors, the Court finds \n$16,500.00 to be a reasonable attorney's fee in this case. \nCOSTS \nPlaintiff seeks the sum of $564.18.  This sum reflects the cost of filing the Complaint \n($150.00), long distance telephone charges, fax and copy charges, postage, and $74.50 in \n3 \nA072A \n(Rev.8/82) \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE   Document 16    Filed 09/22/03   Page 4 of 6\nWestlaw research.  Defendants object that this amount is \"comprised entirely of non-\ncompensable items included within office overhead.\"  (Def.'s brief at p. 5). \nThe Court agrees that the filing fee of$150.00 is recoverable, but denies the other \nclaimed costs.  The Court does not award costs for long distance charges, faxes, postage or \nWestlaw research.  With regard to the photocopying charges, those costs are denied without \nprejudice for the following reason. \nExpenses for photocopies \"necessarily obtained for use in the case\"  are recoverable by the \nprevailing party as costs. 28 U.S.C. § 1920 (2000).  Not all copying costs are recoverable.  See \nBrewer-Georgia, 985 F.Supp. 1485, 1485 (N.D. Ga. 1997)(Copies made fiJr \"convenience, \npreparation, research, or for records of counsel are not recoverable. \"); Independence Tube Corp. \nv.  Copperweld Corp., 543 F.Supp. 706, 722 (D. Ill. 1982) (Copying costs for correspondence and \ncopies of cases are not taxable.).  Moreover, the burden is on the party seeking reimbursement for \nphotocopying costs to show that the photocopied items were necessary; if that party fails to meet \nthe burden, the court should not award costs for those items. Tirapel/i v. Advanced Equities, Inc., \n222 F.Supp.2d 1081, 1085 -1086 (N.D.Ill.,2002).  Because the Court has no way to determine the \npurpose for which copies were made and whether they were in fact necessarily obtained for use \nin the case, this item of cost is denied without prejudice.  Plaintiff may, at her election, resubmit \nfor the Court's reconsideration this item of costs with additional explanation. \nCONCLUSION \nPursuant to 42 US.c. § 1988 for the reasons herein stated, \nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Plaintiffs Motion for Costs and Attorney's Fees \n(Docket No. 11) be, and it is hereby, GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.

In paragraph 26 of their Answer, the \ndefendants admit that the plaintiff's father called ADHS in November of 2002 and requested an \nACS enrollment application.  Furthennore, the defendants admit in paragraph 27 of their \nAnswer, and paragraph 3 oftheir Response to Motion for Preliminary Injunctive Relief, that they \nrefuse to give the plaintiff an application, \nTo the extent the defendants state on page I of their Brief in Support of Defendants' \nResponse to Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction that the plaintiff seeks an injunction \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 8     Filed 07/29/2003     Page 2 of 30 \n\"requiring ADHS to immediately accept her ACS waiver application\", they mischaracterize the \nadmitted facts of this case.  The defendants simply refuse to give the plaintiff an ACS \napplication, and admit in paragraph 9 of their Answer that they have refused to give applications \nto thousands of other disabled individuals. \nIn defense of this lawsuit, the defendants argue that:  I) the plaintiff does not have \nstanding to bring this lawsuit; 2) the federal statutes relied on by the plaintiff do not confer rights \nenforceable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983; 3) the plaintiff is not faced with a threat of irreparable harm \nbecause there are no open slots under the ACS waiver; and 4) the plaintiff cannot prove a \nlikelihood of success on the merits.  For the reasons set forth below, these arguments are without \nmerit, and the plaintiff should be granted the injunction requested in her Complaint. \n1.  STANDING \nStanding is the threshold question in every federal case.  Federal jurisdiction is \"defmed \nand limited by Article III of the Constitution ... [and] is constitutionally restricted to 'cases' and \n'controversies.'\"  Tarsney v. O'Keefe, 225 FJd 929, 934 (8th Cir. 1999) (citing Flast v. Cohen, \n392 U.S. 83, 94 (1968)).  A case or controversy exists only if a plaintiff \"personally has suffered \nsome actual or threatened injury as a result of the putatively illegal conduct of the defendant.\" \nId. (citing Gladstone v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 99 (1979)).  If a plaintiff has not \nsuffered an injury, there is no standing and the court is without jurisdiction to consider the action. \nId. (citing Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 750-66 (\\984)).  However, if a lawsuit challenges the \nlegality of government action or inaction, and the plaintiff is affected by such conduct, there is \nordinarily little question that the plaintiff has standing.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. \n555,561 (1992). \n2 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 8     Filed 07/29/2003     Page 3 of 30 \nThe plaintiff has standing to assert the claims set forth in her Complaint.  According to \nher Complaint, the plaintiff alleges that the defendants refuse to give her an application for ACS \nservices, that she has a right under the Medicaid Act to receive an application, that she has no \nway of getting into the ACS program without an application, and that the defendants refuse to \nprovide a fair hearing with respect to her request for an application.  By these allegations, the \nplaintiff clearly states a case or controversy under Article III.  The plaintiff is directly affected by \nthe steadfast refusal of the defendants to give her an applications for ACS services, and it would \nseem that a clearer case of standing could not be imagined.  Indeed, a similar argument made by \nthe Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services was characterized as \"frivolous\" by \nthe district court, and summarily rejected by the Eleventh Circuit in Doe v. Chiles, 136 F.3d 709, \nn.8 (lith Cir. 200 I).  See also Lindsey v. Bruton, No. I :98cvI54-T, 1999 WL 33320971, at *2 \n(W.o. N.C. Jan. 20, 1999) (plaintiffs have standing to assert that North Carolina was using funds \nintended for home and community-based services for other purposes, and diverting those funds \naway from their child). \nContrary to what the defendants argue on page 8 of their brief, the issue of standing does \nnot hinge on whether the plaintiff has enforceable statutory-rights under the Medicaid Act. \nWhether the plaintiff has statutory rights enforceable in a case filed pursuant to 42 U.S.c. § 1983 \nis an issue that relates to the legal merits of her case, and has nothing to do whether she has \nalleged a case or controversy and, therefore, has a right to sue under Article III.  Standing is a \njurisdictional issue, and is distinct from legal and factual issues that touch on the merits of a \nparticular case.  See Bruggeman v. Blagojevich, 324 F.3d 906, 909-10 (7th Cir. 2003) (equating \nstanding with the legal or factual merits of a case is a \"misunderstanding of standing\"). \n3 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 8     Filed 07/29/2003     Page 4 of 30 \nEven if the issue of standing hinged on the availability of rights enforceable under 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983, the defendants overlook the fact that the plaintiff has also filed a claim against \nthem under the procedural due process component of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Certainly, \nthere can be no questioning the fact that claims arising under the Constitution are enforceable \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1,4-6 (1980). \nIt should be noted that the issue of standing generally arises in Medicaid cases filed by \nMedicaid providers or other private organizations on behalf of disabled individuals.  This case is \nfiled by an individual, not a private organization, and the issue of \"representational\" standing \ndoes not arise.  See Pediatric Specialty Care, Inc. v. Arkansas Department of Human Services, \n293 F.3d 472 (8th Cir. 2002) (issue of \"representational\" standing not relevant when a Medicaid \nrecipient is a plaintiff in the case). \nThe only other argument made by the defendants with respect to the issue of standing is \nthat the Medicaid Act was enacted by Congress pursuant to the Spending Clause, and legislation \nenacted under the Spending Clause generally does not give rise to a right to sue for its \nenforcement.  The problem with their argument is that it ignores Wilder v. Virginia Hospital \nAssociation, 496 U.S. 498 (1990), in which the Supreme Court held that the Medicaid Act \nexplicitly confers a private right of enforcement in favor of Medicaid recipients and providers. \nId. at 522-23. \nII.  ENFORCEABILITY OF STATUTORY RIGHTS UNDER 42 U.S.c. § 1983 \nThe next argument made by the defendants is that the Medicaid statutes relied on by the \nplaintiff in Counts One through Four of her Complaint are not enforceable under 42 U.S.C. § \n1983.  In Pediatric Specialty Care, the Eighth Circuit held that \"[s]ection 1983 provides a federal \n4 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 8     Filed 07/29/2003     Page 5 of 30 \ncause of action against anyone who, acting pursuant to state authority, violates any 'rights \nprivileges or inununities secured by the Constitution and laws' of the United States.\" 293 F.3d at \n477.  \"A remedy is available under § 1983 for violations of federal statutory and constitutional \nlaw.\"  Id. (citing Thiboutot, 448 U.S. at 4).  However, with respect to § 1983 claims based on a \nfederal statute, \"a plainciff must assert a violation of a federal right, not just a violation of a \nfederal law.\"  Id. (citing Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329, 340 (1997)). \nIn determining whether a federal statute gives rise to a federal right, we must consider \nthree factors:  I) whether the provision in question is \"intend[e d] to benefit\" the plaintiff, that is, \n\"couched in mandatory, rather than precatory, terms\"; 2) whether the interest asserted by the \nplaintiff is not so \"vague and amorphous\" that it is beyond the competence of the judiciary to \nenforce; and 3) whether the provision in question creates a binding obligation on the \ngovernmental unit.  Id. at 477-78.  A federal right must be \"unambiguously conferred\" in order to \nsupport a cause of action under § 1983.\"  Gonzaga University v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 283 (2002). \nLike the statutes at issue in this case, the statutes at issue in Pediatric Specialty Care were \nMedicaid statutes as well.  Applying the three-part test set forth in Blessing, the Eighth Circuit \nheld that the language of 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a) is \"mandatory language\", and that 42 U.S.C. §§ \n1396a(a)(lO)(A), 1396a(a)(43), and 1396d(r) create a \"binding obligation on ADHS to create a \nstate plan that includes the provision ofEPSDT services as they are defined in § I 396d(r). \" 293 \nF.3d at 478-79.  The Eighth Circuit stated that \"this obligation is not so ambiguous or amorphous \nthat its enforcement strains judicial competence\", and held that the plaintiffs had a federal right \nunder those statutes that is enforceable in a § 1983 action.  Id. at 479. \nThe Medicaid statutes relied on by the plaintiff are, in order of their appearance in the \n5 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 8     Filed 07/29/2003     Page 6 of 30 \nComplaint, 42 U.S.C. § I 396a(a)(8), 42 U.S.c. § I 396n(c)(2), and 42 U.S.C. § I 396a(a)(3). \nThere appears to be no reported case from the Eighth Circuit, or the District Court for either the \nEastern or Western District of Arkansas, that considers whether these statutes create rights that \nare enforceable under § 1983.  However, with the principles of Blessing in mind, and with \nguidance from Pediatric Specialty Care and cases from other jurisdictions in which the statutes \ncited by the plaintiff are involved, it is clear that each of these statutes is enforceable under § \n1983. \nA.  THE \"OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY\" PROVISION OF 42 U.S.c. 1396a(a)(8) \nCount One of the plaintiff's Complaint is based on 42 U.S.c. § 1396a(a)(8), which \nstates that the State Medicaid Plan \"must ... provide that all individuals wishing to make \napplication for medical assistance under the plan shall have opportunity to do so, and that such \nassistance shall be furnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible individuals\".  The \nplaintiff claims that the defendants are violating the \"opportunity to apply\" provision of this \nstatute by refusing to give her an application for ACS services. \nUnder the first prong of the Blessing test, we consider whether the language of this \nprovision is couched in mandatory, rather than precatory, terms.  \"The language of § 1396a(a) is \nmandatory language.\"  Pediatric Specialty Care, 293 F.3d at 478.  Therefore, as a matter oflaw, \nthe \"opportunity to apply\" provision is intended to benefit the plaintiff, and the first prong is \nsatisfied. \nUnder the second prong of the Blessing test, we consider whether the interest asserted by \nthe plaintiff is not so \"vague and amorphous\" that it is beyond the competence of the judiciary to \nenforce.  The plaintiff submits that there is nothing vague or amorphous about her interest in \n6 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 8     Filed 07/29/2003     Page 7 of 30 \nreceiving an application for ACS services.  If anything, the \"opportunity to apply\" provision of § \nI 396a(a)(8) stands for the proposition that the plaintiff has the right to receive an application. \nClearly, it is impossible for the plaintiff to begin the process of applying for ACS services if the \ndefendants will not give her an application.  There is nothing vague or amorphous about the \nplaintiff's interest in receiving an application, or anything else that puts it beyond the competency \nofthe judiciary to enforce. \nUnder the third prong of the Blessing test, we consider whether the provision creates a \nbinding obligation on the defendants.  The language of § 1396a(a)(8) states that a person \"shall\" \nhave the opportunity to apply for services, and seems to be just as binding as the Medicaid \nstatutes at issue in Pediatric Specialty Care.  In addition, 42 C.F.R. § 435.906 states that the state \nagency \"must afford an individual wishing to do so the opportunity to apply for Medicaid \nwithout delay.\"  Read together, the language of 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8) and 42 C.F.R. § 435.906 \ncreate a binding obligation on the defendants to give an ACS application to the plaintiff. \nThe defendants suggest on page 10 of their brief that they do not have a binding \nobligation to provide ACS services to the plaintiff because the ACS program is optional and of \n\"finite duration\".  The plaintiff agrees that the program, like all waiver programs developed \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c), is an optional program that Arkansas has chosen to include in its \nState Medicaid Plan.  However, even though the program is optional, the fact remains that the \nACS program is part of the Plan, and that the defendants must comply with all federal statutes \nand regulations that apply to § 1396n(c) waiver programs as long as it remains.  Smith v. \nRasmussen, 249 F.3d 755,757 (8th Cir. 2001); Weaver v. Reagen, 886 F.2d 194,197 (8th Cir. \n1989). \n7 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 8     Filed 07/29/2003     Page 8 of 30 \nThere do not appear to be any cases that deal with the specific issue of whether the \n\"opportunity to apply\" provision creates an enforceable right under § 1983 when a state simply \nrefuses to provide an application, perhaps because no state except Arkansas has taken such a \nharsh position.  A similar case, however, was presented in McMillan v. McCrimon, 807 F. Supp. \n475 (CD. Ill. 1992), in which the \"opportunity to apply\" provision was applied against the \nIllinois Department of Rehabilitation Services after it provided applications but refused to accept \nor process them.  Like the defendants in the present case, Illinois argued that the plaintiffs were \nalready receiving basic Medicaid benefits, that the plaintiffs had been given a full opportunity to \napply for such benefits (but no opportunity to apply for the larger array of benefits available \nunder the waiver), and that as a matter of law the provision does not apply to optional waiver \nservices.  rd. at 480.  The district court rejected these arguments because the term \"medical \nassistance\" used in § 1396a(a)(8) is defined as \"payment of part or all of the costs of twenty-four \nlisted types of services.\"  rd.  In addition, § 1396n(c ) states that a State plan \"may include as \n'medical assistance' under such plan payment for all or part of the cost of home or community \nbased services.\"  rd. (citing 42 U.S.c. § 1396n(c)(l». Based on these provisions, the district \ncourt held that the \"opportunity to aIJply\" provision of § I 396a(a)(8) \"must extend beyond the \ninitial application for Medicaid eligibility to services and benefits provided to Medicaid eligible \npersons.\"  rd. \nThe situation in McMillan is not as oppressive as the situation presented here, where \nArkansas refuses to even provide applications.  Although distinguishable on its facts, McMillan \nstands for the proposition that §1396a(a)(8) provides a clear and unambiguous statement of the \nright to have a waiver application accepted and processed by the State, and that this right can be \n8 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 8     Filed 07/29/2003     Page 9 of 30 \nreadily enforced.  Although McMillan did not consider whether the \"opportunity to apply\" \nprovision creates a right enforceable under § 1983, the fact that Illinois did not see fit to even \nraise the issue, and that the district court had no problem understanding and enforcing the \nprovision, speaks volumes in favor of its enforceability under the circumstances of this case. \nB.  THE \"REASONABLE PROMPTNESS\" PROVISION OF 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(8) \nAs stated above, 42 U.S.c. § I 396a(a)(8) provides that the State Plan \"must ... \nprovide that all individuals wishing to make application for medical assistance under the plan \nshall have opportunity to do so, and that such assistance shall be furnished with reasonable \npromptness to all eligible individuals\".  The plaintiff claims that the defendants are violating the \n\"reasonable promptness\" provision of this statute by refusing to give her an application for ACS \nservices. \nUnder the first prong of the Blessing test, we consider whether the language of this \nprovision is \"couched in mandatory, rather than precatory, terms\".  \"The language of § 1396a(a) \nis mandatory language.\"  Pediatric Specialty Care, 293 F.3d at 478.  Therefore, as a matter of \nlaw, the \"reasonable promptness\" provision is intended to benefit the plaintiff, and the first prong \nis satisfied. \nUnder the second prong of the Blessing test, we consider whether the interest asserted by \nthe plaintiff is not so \"vague and amorphous\" that it is beyond the competence of the judiciary to \nenforce.  The plaintiff submits that there is nothing vague or amorphous about her interest in \nbeing given an application for ACS services.  If anything, the \"reasonable promptness\" provision \nof § 1396a(a)(8) stands for the proposition that the plaintiff has the right to receive an application \nso that she can fill it out and submit it to ADHS for processing.  Clearly, it is impossible for the \n9 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 8     Filed 07/29/2003     Page 10 of 30 \nplaintiff to even begin the process of applying for ACS services without an application.  There is \nnothing vague or amorphous about the plaintiffs interest in receiving an application, and nothing \nelse that puts this interest beyond the competency of the judiciary to enforce. \nUnder the third prong of the Blessing test, we consider whether the provision creates a \nbinding obligation on me defendants.  The language of § I 396a(a)(8) states that medical \nassistance \"shall be furnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible individuals\", and seems \nto be just as binding as the Medicaid statutes at issue in Pediatric Specialty Care. \nA number of other jurisdictions have found that the \"reasonable promptness\" provision of \n§ 1396a(a)(8) creates an enforceable right under § 1983.  In Bryson v. Shumway. 308 F.3d 79 \n(J st Cir. 2002), the plaintiffs suffered from acquired brain disorders, and had the option to \nreceive medical care for that condition under the New Hampshire Medicaid Plan.  The plaintiffs \npreferred to receive those services in an HCBS waiver program established under § 1396n(c). \nThe plaintiffs alleged that New Hampshire was violating the \"reasonable promptness\" provision \nof § I 396a(a)(8) by refusing to fill open slots under the program, and New Hampshire argued \nthat the \"reasonable promptness\" provision is not enforceable under § 1983.  Id. at 88. \nAfter setting forth in comprehensive fashion a legal overview of the Medicaid Act and \nhome and community-based waiver programs under § 1396n( c), the First Circuit got to the issue \nof whether the \"reasonable promptness\" provision creates an enforceable right.  It discussed \nBlessing and its three-part test, and held that the provision, \"on its face, does intend to benefit the \nplaintiffs.\"  Id. \nSection I 396a(a)(8) requires that state Medicaid plans provide that medical assistance \n\"shall be furnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible individuals.\"  This \nparagraph is a part of the litany of procedural and substantive protections which state \n10 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 8     Filed 07/29/2003     Page 11 of 30 \nMedicaid plans must provide, such as the opportunity for a hearing, and safeguards \nagainst the disclosure of private information.  By its terms, it benefits \"eligible \nindividuals.\"  Those patients who are on the waiting list and for whom slots are available \nare, we think, \"eligible\" under the statute such that they are entitled to reasonable \npromptness.  The first prong of Blessing has been met. \nSecond, the right conferred is not vague or amorphous.  \"A statute is not impermissibly \nvague simply because it requires judicial inquiry into 'reasonableness. '\"  Common law \ncourts have reviewed actions for reasonableness since time immemorial. \nFinally, § I 396a(a)(8) does unambiguously bind the states. The subsection mandates that \nstate plans \"must\" provide that medical assistance \"shall\" be provided with reasonable \npromptness.  These are not mere guidelines, but rather requirements which states must \nmeet under the Medicaid system. \nld. at 88-89 (internal citations omitted).  The First Circuit concluded by stating that \"there is a § \n1983 cause of action arising from the 'reasonable promptness' provision of 42 U.S.c. § \nI 396a(a)(8) under the state model waiver plan as approved.\"  ld. at 89. \nThe same result was reached in Doe v. Chiles, 136 F.3d 709 (11th Cir. 2001), in which a \ngroup of developmentally disabled individuals claimed that Florida was violating their right to \n\"reasonable promptness\" under § 1396a(a)(8) by causing unreasonable delays in the provision of \nwaiver services.  Addressing the first prong of the Blessing test, the Eleventh Circuit held that \n\"[t]he plain language of the provision's reasonable promptness clause is clearly intended to \nbenefit Medicaid-'eligible individuals' - such as the appellees in this case.  Therefore, we do not \nhesitate in concluding that the clause meets the first factor.\"  ld. at 715. \nWith regard to the second prong of the Blessing test, the Eleventh Circuit held that \nenforcement of the provision would not strain judicial competence.  \"[S]ection 1396a(a)(8)'s \nrequirement that 'assistance shall be furnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible \nindividuals' presents a sufficiently specific and definite standard readily susceptible to judicial \n11 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 8     Filed 07/29/2003     Page 12 of 30 \nassessment ... Indeed, given the egregious facts of this case it is difficult for the appellants to \nargue that the appellees do not meet the second factor.  We agree with the appellees' assertion \nthat in this context, 'lilt is axiomatic that delays of 'several years' ... are far outside the realm of \nreasonableness.'\"  Id. at 717. \nFinally with respect to the third prong of the Blessing test, the Eleventh Circuit held that \nthe language of the provision \"is undoubtedly cast in mandatory rather than precatory terms.\"  Id. \nat 718.  \"In sum, we hold that the appellees have a federal right to reasonably prompt provision \nof assistance under section 1396a(a)(8) of the Medicaid Act, and that this right is enforceable \nunder section \n1983.\"  Id. at 719. \nA nwnber of district courts have also concluded that the \"reasonable promptness\" \nprovision of § 1396a(a)(8) is enforceable under § 1983.  See Martin v. Taft, 222 F. Supp. 2d 940, \n978 (S.D. Ohio 2002); Antrican v. Buell, 158 F. Supp. 2d 663, 670-671 (E.D. N.C. 2001); \nBoudreau v. Ryan, No. 00-C-5392, 2001 WL 840583, at \"9 (N.D. Ill. May 1,2001); Boulet v. \nCellucci, 107 F. Supp. 2d 61, 71-72 (D. Mass. 2000); Lewis v. New Mexico Department of \nHealth, 94 F. Supp. 2d 1217, 1233-1236 (D. N.M. 2000); Sobky v. Smoley, 855 F. Supp. 1123, \n1146-1147 (E.D. CaL 1994).  For the reasons stated in these cases, and in the other cases cited \nabove, the plaintiff has an enforceable right to reasonable promptness under § 1396a(a)(8). \nC.  THE \"FREEDOM OF CHOICE\" PROVISION OF 42 U.S.C. 1396n(c) \nUnder 42 U.S.c. § 1396n(c)(2), an HCBS waiver shall not be granted unless the \nstate provides assurances that: \n12 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 8     Filed 07/29/2003     Page 13 of 30 \n(A)  necessary safeguards (including adequate standards for provider participation) \nhave been taken to protect the health and welfare of individuals provided services \nunder the waiver and to assure financial accountability for funds expended with \nrespect to such services; \n(B)  the State will provide, with respect to individuals who -\n(i)  are entitled to medical assistance for inpatient hospital services, nursing \nfacility services, or services in an intermediate care facility for the \nmentally retarded under the State plan, \n(ii)  may require such services, and \n(iii)  may be eligible for such home or community-based care under such \nwaIver, \nfor an evaluation of the need for inpatient hospital services, nursing facility \nservices, or services in an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded; \n(C)  such individuals who are determined to be likely to require the level of care \nprovided in a hospital, nursing facility, or intermediate care facility for the \nmentally retarded are informed of the feasible alternatives, if available under the \nwaiver, at the choice of such individuals, to the provision of inpatient hospital \nservices, nursing facility services, or services in an intermediate care facility for \nthe mentally retarded; \n:;  *  *  :; \n(E)  the State will provide to the Secretary annually, consistent with a data collection \nplan designed by the Secretary, information on the impact of the waiver granted \nunder this subsection on the type and amount of medical assistance provided \nunder the State plan ind on the health and welfare of recipients. \nUnder this section, the Social Security Act \"permits States to offer, under a waiver of statutory \nrequirements, an array of home and community-based services that an individual needs to avoid \ninstitutionalization.\"  42 C.F.R. § 441.300.  In addition, unless a state provides the following \nsatisfactory assurances to CMS, CMS will not grant a waiver under § 1396n and may terminate a \nwaiver already granted: \n13 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 8     Filed 07/29/2003     Page 14 of 30 \n(a)  Health and Welfare - Assurance that necessary safeguards have been taken to \nprotect the health and welfare of the recipients ofthe services.  Those safeguards \nmust include -\n(1)  Adequate standards for all types of providers that provide services under \nthe waiver; \n(2)  Assurance that the standards of any State licensure or certification \nrequirements are met for services or for individuals furnishing services \nthat are provided under the waiver; and \n(3)  Assurance that all facilities covered by section 1616( e) of the Act, in \nwhich home and community-based services will be provided, are in \ncompliance with applicable State standards that meet the requirements of \n45 C.F.R. Part 1397 for board and care facilities. \n*  *  •  * \n(c)  Evaluation of need -Assurance that the agency will provide for the following: \n(1)  Initial evaluation -An evaluation of the need for the level of care provided \nin a hospital, a NF, or an ICF/MR when there is a reasonable indication \nthat a recipient might need the services in the near future (that is, a month \nor less) unless he or she receives home or community-based services. For \npurposes of this section, \"evaluation\" means a review of an individual \nrecipient's condition to determine -\n(i)  If the recipient requires the level of care provided in a hospital as \ndefined in § 440.10 of this subchapter, a NF as defined in section \n1919(a) of the Act, or an ICF/MR as defined by § 440.150 of this \nsubchapter; and \n(ii)  That the recipient, but for the provision of waiver services, would \notherwise be institutionalized in such a facility. \n(2)  Periodic reevaluations - Reevaluations, at least annually, of each recipient \nreceiving home or community-based services to determine if the recipient \ncontinues to need the level of care provided and would, but for the \nprovision of waiver services, otherwise be institutionalized in one of the \nfollowing institutions: \n(i)  A hospital; \n14 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 8     Filed 07/29/2003     Page 15 of 30 \n(ii)  A NF; or \n(iii)  An ICF/MR. \n(d)  Alternatives - Assurance that when a recipient is determined to be likely to \nrequire the level of care provided in a hospital, NF, ICF, or ICF/MR, the recipient \nor his or her legal representative will be -\n(1)  Informed of any feasible alternatives available under the waiver; and \n(2)  Given the choice of either institutional or home and community-based \nservices. \n*  *  *  * \n(f)  Actual total expenditures - Assurance that the agency's actual total expenditures \nfor home and community-based and other Medicaid services under the waiver and \nits claim for FFP in expenditures for the services provided to recipients under the \nwaiver will not, in any year of the waiver period, exceed 100 percent of the \namount that would be incurred by the State's Medicaid program for these \nindividuals, absent the waiver, in -\n(1)  A hospital; \n(2)  ANF; or \n(3)  An ICFIMR. \n42 C.F.R. § 441.302. \nUnder these federal statutes and regulations, when a state, like Arkansas, participates in \nboth the ICFIMR program and the HCBS program, a disabled person has an enforceable right to \nbe notified of feasible alternatives for the appropriate level of care, and freedom to choose to \nreceive care lmder the ICFIMR program or HCBS program.  In Wood v. Tompkins, 33 F.3d 600 \n(6th Cir. 1994), the Sixth Circuit held that 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(2) and 42 C.F.R. § 441.302 \n\"protect the health and welfare of home care Medicaid recipients\" and \"impose mandatory duties \nupon participating states\".  Id. at 608. \n15 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 8     Filed 07/29/2003     Page 16 of 30 \n[TJhere is nothing vague or amorphous about what the statute or corresponding \nregulations require of participating states.  The duties set forth therein do not involve any \nfuzzy, undefined concepts like 'reasonable efforts.'  Rather, these duties involve \nunambiguous directives that are well within the ability of the jUdiciary to enforce. \nId.  Based on its analysis, the Sixth Circuit specifically held that 42 U.S.C. §§ I 396n(c)(2)(A), \n(B), (C), and (E), and 42 C.F.R. §§ 441.302(a), (c), (d), and (f)(2) create rights that may be \nenforced under § 1983.  Id. at 607-611. \nThe Sixth Circuit seems to be the only federal appellate circuit that has considered this \nissue, and it appears that only one federal district court has as well.  In Lindsey v. Bruton, No. \nI :98cv154-T, 1999 WL 33320971 (W.D. N.C. Jan. 20, 1999), the plaintiffs alleged that North \nCarolina was using funds intended for home and community-based services for other purposes, \nand diverting those funds away from their child, in violation of 42 U.S.c. § 1396n(c)(2) and 42 \nC.F.R. § 441.302.  Applying the three-part test set forth in Blessing, and finding Wood highly \npersuasive, the district court held that 42 U.S.c. §§ 1396n(c)(2)(A), (B), (C), and (E), and 42 \nC.F.R. §§ 441.302(a), (c), (d), and (f)(2) create rights that may be enforced under § 1983.  Id. at \n*6 .  The result should be no different in this case. \nD.  THE \"FAIR HEARING\" PROVISION OF 42 U.S.c. 1396a(a)(3) \nPursuant to 42 U.S.c. § 1396a(a)(3), the State Plan \"must ... provide for granting \nan opportunity for a fair hearing before the State agency to any individual whose claim for \nmedical assistance under the plan is denied or is not acted upon with reasonable promptness\". \nThe plaintiff claims that the defendants are violating this provision by not providing her with an \nopportunity for a fair hearing after they refused to send her an ACS enrollment application, and \nby placing her on a \"request list\" for an indefinite period of time. \n16 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 8     Filed 07/29/2003     Page 17 of 30 \nUnder the first prong of the Blessing test, we consider whether the language of this \nprovision is \"couched in mandatory, rather than precatory, terms\".  \"The language of § 1396a(a) \nis mandatory language.\"  Pediatric Specialty Care, 293 F.3d at 478.  Therefore, as a matter of \nlaw, the \"fair hearing\" provision is intended to benefit the plaintiff, and the first prong ofthe \nBlessing test is satisfieu. \nUnder the second prong of the Blessing test, we consider whether the interest asserted by \nthe plaintiff is not so \"vague and amorphous\" that it is beyond the competence of the jUdiciary to \nenforce.  The plaintiff submits that there is nothing vague or amorphous about her interest in \nbeing given a right to a fair hearing ifthe defendants refuse to give her an application for ACS \nservices.  The \"fair hearing\" provision provides the plaintiff a right to an appeal if the defendants \ndeny her claim, or fail to consider her claim with reasonable promptness, and there is nothing \nvague or amorphous about this concept.  The judiciary would certainly be competent to enforce \nthe plaintiff's interest in receiving a fair hearing. \nUnder the third prong of the Blessing test, we consider whether the provision creates a \nbinding obligation on the defendants.  The language of § !396a(a)(3) states that the State plan \n\"must provide\" for granting an opportunity for a fair hearing to the plaintiff, and thus creates a \nbinding obligation on the defendants.  Certainly, the language of the \"fair hearing\" provision is \nmandatory language, and is just as binding as the Medicaid statutes at issue in Pediatric Specialty \nCare.  See Meachem v. Wing. 77 F. Supp. 2d 431, 438 (S.D. N.Y. 1999) (the \"fair hearing\" \nprovision is enforceable under § 1983). \nIII.  THREAT OF IRREPARABLE HARM \n17 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 8     Filed 07/29/2003     Page 18 of 30 \nWhether a preliminary injunction should issue involves consideration of:  I) the threat of \nirreparable harm to the movant; 2) the state of balance between this harm and the injury \nthat granting the injunction will inflict on other parties litigant; 3) the probability that movant \nwill succeed on the merits; and 4) the public interest.  Dataphase Systems, Inc. v. C L Systems, \nInc., 640 F.2d 109, 112· (8th Cir. 1981).  When applying these factors, \"a court should flexibly \nweigh the case's particular circumstances to determine whether the balance of equities so favors \nthe movant that justice requires the court to intervene.\"  United Industries Corp. v. Clorox, 140 \nF.3d 1175, 1179 (8th Cir. \\998). \nThe defendants argue at page 5 of their brief that the plaintiff does not suffer a threat of \nirreparable harm arising out of their refusal to give her an application for ACS services.  The \nplaintiff disagrees.  Because the defendants refuse to give an application to the plaintiff, she has \nno way of applying for ACS services.  If she cannot apply for ACS services, she has no way to \nget them.  By foreclosing the plaintiffs ability to receive waiver services, the defendants have \nexposed her to a very real threat of physical and emotional harm that clearly satisfies her burden \nof proving a \"threat of irreparable harm\".  Chu Drua Cha v. Noot, 696 F.2d 594, 599 (8th Cir. \n1982) (irreparable harm established because loss of some medical care cannot be made up by the \nlater entry ofa money judgment)(citing Turner v. Walsh, 435 F. Supp. 707, 711 (W.D. Mo. \n1977) (termination or reduction of Medicaid benefits is sufficient irreparable injury to justify \ntemporary restraining order), affd per curiam, 574 F.2d 456 (8th Cir. 1978) (approving the \ndistrict court's opinion as \"weJl-reasoned\")).  The defendants provide ACS services because they \nenrich the lives of those who need them, i.e. disabled individuals for whom these services were \nspecifically designed, and there can be no serious question that depriving the plaintiff of her only \n18 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 8     Filed 07/29/2003     Page 19 of 30 \nopportunity to receive these services exposes her to a threat of irreparable harm. \nThe defendants argue that the plaintiff cannot prove a threat of irreparable harm simply \nbecause there are no open slots under the ACS program.  The defendants are mistaken.  On page \n5 of their brief, the defendants tell the Court that there are only 3,067 total slots under the ACS \nprogram, but a letter obrained from the defendants under the Arkansas Freedom of Information \nAct shows that there are 3,598 total slots under the program at this time.  See the letter attached \nhereto and marked as \"Exhibit I \".  This letter is dated August 6, 2002, and is from Dr. James \nFarris, Regional Administrator for the federal Department of Health & Human Services, Centers \nfor Medicare & Medicaid Services, to Ray Hanley, former Director of the Division of Medical \nServices of the Arkansas Department of Human Services.  In the letter, Dr. Farris states that he is \npleased to inform Mr. Hanley that his request for an amendment to the Arkansas Home and \nCommunity-Based Services Waiver has been approved effective July 1, 2001.  The letter states \nthat 2,998 slots were approved for state fiscal year 200112002, and 3,598 slots were approved for \nstate fiscal year 2002/2003.  There are 3,598 slots approved for the current fiscal year. \nThe defendants state on page 6 of their brief that there were 2,665 \"unduplicated \nindividuals\" receiving waiver services on June 30, 2003.  Based on this number, there were 993 \nopen slots at that time.  According to other information provided by the defendants, there are \napproximately 2,596 people on the \"request list\" maintained by the defendants.  These people are \nbasically waiting in line to receive an ACS application.  See the document attached hereto and \nmarked as \"Exhibit 2\".  The defendants refuse to give an application to any of these people, \nincluding the plaintiff, and refuse to determine whether any of them are entitled to one ofthe \nopen slots. \n19 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 8     Filed 07/29/2003     Page 20 of 30 \nThe defendants argue on page II of their briefthat the plaintiff does not face a threat of \nirreparable harm in this case because she is 2,285 on the \"request list\", and would not get a slot \neven if all open slots were filled overnight.  Their argument is based on the idea that each person \nahead of the plaintiff on the \"request list\" will be found eligible for ACS services.  This may not \nbe the case.  According to the ACS Provider Manual, eligibility for waiver services \"includes a \ndetermination of categorical eligibility, a level of care determination, a comprehensive diagnosis \nand evaluation, the development of a plan of care, a cost comparison to determine cost \neffectiveness, and notification of a choice between home and community-based services and \ninstitutional services.\"  See § 227.000 of the DDS Alternative Community Services Waiver \nProgram Manual attached hereto as part of \"Exhibit 3\".  Without an application, there is no way \nfor anyone to say that the plaintiff will not qualify for ACS services. \nIn addition, the argument made by the defendants is based on the presumoption that \nwaiver slots are filled on a \"fust come, first serve\" basis.  While this may very well be the case, \nthe plaintiff understands that most states employ some form of triage procedure to prioritize \nservices based on severity of need.  Even if the defendants do not use such a procedure and fill \nslots on a \"first come, first serve\" basis, their argument belies the fact that there were 993 open \nslots under the ACS program less than a month ago. \nThe sad fact of the matter is that the defendants refuse to give ACS applications to the \npeople on the \"request list\", and thereby subject each of them to a threat of irreparable harm by \nthe sheer delay involved in waiting to see if they even qualify for ACS services.  Why the \ndefendants refuse to give these people applications is beyond the plaintiff, especially when there \nare nearly 1,000 open slots.  Give the people applications, let them apply, determine their \n20 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 8     Filed 07/29/2003     Page 21 of 30 \neligibility with reasonable promptness, fill the open slots, and let those who do not get a slot wait \nfor one to come open or, if they choose, go to court and argue that more slots should be created. \nIf the plaintiff is given an application but her claim of eligibility denied, she can appeal that \ndecision to ADHS while she would otherwise be waiting for an open slot.  The plaintiff should \nnot have to wait in line for an application, only to find out months or years later, after she makes \nit to the top of the list and finally gets an application, that the defendants reject her claim for \neligibility.  Under this scenario, the plaintiff would lose the slot that came open for her, after \nyears of waiting on the \"request list\", while she appeals the adverse eligibility decision to ADHS \nand, if necessary, through the state-court system under the Arkansas Administrative Procedure \nAct.  If the defendants deny her claim for eligibility, the plaintiff can do all of this now and avoid \nthe wait.  Who knows, if ACS applications are provided and the open slots are filled, the plaintiff \nmay get a slot and not have to wait at all. \nThe defendants suggest that the plaintiff cannot show a need for ACS services, and will \nnot suffer irreparable harm if she does not get them, because she is eligible for Medicaid benefits \nunder the TEFRA Demonstration Waiver, her parents have private insurance, and her parents are \nobligated under state law to provide her \"necessities\".  These arguments are without merit.  First, \nthe plaintiff would gladly demonstrate her need for ACS services if the defendants would simply \ngive her an application.  Second, the TEFRA Demonstration Waiver is an optional program that \ncould be cut tomorrow.  Indeed, Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee threatened to terminate the \nTEFRA program in January of 2002.  Third, no person may qualify for ACS services unless they \nqualify for Medicaid in the first place.  See § 228.000 of the DDS Alternative Community \nServices Waiver Program Manual attached hereto as part of \"Exhibit 3\".  It is absurd to argue \n21 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 8     Filed 07/29/2003     Page 22 of 30 \nthat a person does not need ACS services, and will not suffer irreparable harm if he or she does \nnot receive them, simply because he or she qualifies for Medicaid.  The defendants would not \nhave filled the first slot under the waiver if that were the case.  Fifth, the plaintiff's parents do not \nhave private insurance that will pay for the services available to the plaintiff under the ACS \nprogram.  Sixth, although the plaintiffs parents love their daughter more than anything in the \nworld, they are not trained to provide the services available to the plaintiff under the waiver. \nClearly, the plaintifffaces a threat of irreparable harm by not being given an opportunity to apply \nfor ACS services. \nIV.  LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS ON THE MERlTS \nThe plaintiff is a five-year-old girl with Down syndrome, and was born with congenital \nheart defects that have required surgery.  She cannot speak or recognize dangers, and needs \nconstant supervision.  The plaintiff requires supplemental feeding through a gastrostomy tube in \norder to meet her nutritional needs, and has other developmental and physical disabilities \nresulting from her Down syndrome that can be treated with the services the defendants have seen \nfit to include in the ACS program. \nThe plaintiff currently receives Medicaid services under the Child Health Management \nServices (\"CHMS \") program, the Medicaid program in Arkansas designed to treat children with \ndevelopmental delays, age six and under.  See Pediatric Specialty Care, 293 F.3d at 475-76 \n(describing the CHMS program in detail).  As the years pass by and the plaintiff grows out of the \nCHMS program, she will need the services provided under the ACS waiver to help her stay out \nof an institution.  The plaintiffs parents do not want their daughter to be placed in an institution, \nand want her to stay at home for as long as they can take care of her.  With ACS services, the \n22 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 8     Filed 07/29/2003     Page 23 of 30 \nplaintiff can stay at home and stay out of an institution.  Waiver services are designed for people \njust like the plaintiff, are provided nowhere else under the State Medicaid Plan, and include the \nfollowing: \nA.  Supportive living \nEnables individuals to reside successfully in their own homes and assist them in \nacquiring, retaining, and improving the self-help, socialization, and adaptive skills \nnecessary to reside successfully in the home and community-based setting. \nB.  Community experiences \nAllows individuals to gain experience and abilities that will prevent \ninstitutionalization, and improve community acceptance, job opportunities, and \ngeneral well being. \nC.  Respite care \nServices to or for waiver participants, regardless of their age, who are unable to \ncare for themselves because of the absence or need for relief of non-paid \nindividuals, including parents of minors, primary caregivers and spouses of \nparticipants, who normally provide the care. \nD.  Non-medical transportation \nEnables individuals to gain access to ACS and other community services, \nactivities, and resources. \nE.  Waiver coordination \nEnsures the delivery of all direct care services. \nF.  Supported employment \nServices for individuals for whom competitive employment at or above the \nminimum wage is unlikely, or who, because of their disabilities, need intensive \nongoing support to perform in a competitive work setting. \nG.  Adaptive equipment \nProvides for the purchase, leasing, and repair of adaptive, therapeutic, and \n23 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 8     Filed 07/29/2003     Page 24 of 30 \naugmentative equipment required to enable individuals to increase, maintain, or \nimprove their functional capacity to perform daily life tasks that would not be \npossible otherwise. \nH.  Environmental modifications \nProvides for adaptations to the individual's place of residence that are necessary to \nensure the health, welfare, and safety of the individual, or which enable the \nindividual to function with greater independence and without which the individual \nwould require institutionalization. \n1.  Specialized medical supplies \nProvides items necessary for life support, and the ancillary supplies and \nequipment necessary for the proper functioning of such items, including non \ndurable medical equipment not available under the State Plan. \n1.  Supplemental support \nHelp improves or enable the continuance of community living, to allow the \nopportunity to participate in integrated leisure, recreational, social, and \neducational activities, and make a positive difference in the life of the participant. \nK.  Case management \nInvolves the on-going monitoring of the provision of services included in the \nparticipants multi-agency plan of service. \n1.  Consultation \nAssists participants and their parents, guardians, and responsible individuals in \ncarrying out the partiCipant's service plan. \nM.  Crisis intervention \nDelivered in the participant's place of residence or other local community site by a \nmobile intervention team or professional. \nN.  Crisis center \nServices provided in a crisis center equipped to provide short-term intervention, \nincluding 24-hour emergency medical care. \n24 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 8     Filed 07/29/2003     Page 25 of 30 \nSee § 211.000 ofthe DDS Alternative Community Services Waiver Program Manual attached \nhereto as part of \"Exhibit 3\". \nThe plaintiffs father would like to emoll his daughter in the ACS program, and called \nADHS in November of2002 and requested an application.  ADHS would not give the plaintiffs \nfather an application, but said they would send him a Client's Choice form in which he could \ndesignate whether he was interested in obtaining services for his daughter under the ACS \nprogram or ICF/MR program.  ADHS sent a Client's Choice form to the plaintiffs father, which \nhe prepared on behalf of his daughter and sent back to ADHS on November 22, 2002. \nOn January 8, 2003, ADHS sent a letter to the plaintiffs father in which it acknowledged \nthat it had received his Client's Choice form, and that his daughter \"has been added to the \nRequest List and currently is number 2285 on the waiver request list.\"  By their own admission, \nthe defendants refuse to send an ACS application to the plaintiff, and have merely placed her on \na \"request list\" for an indefinite period of time.  All the while, there are approximately 993 \nunfilled slots under the program. \nBased on these facts, the plaintiff is confident in her ability to succeed on the merits of \nthis case.  A similar situation was presented in Benjamin H. v. Ohl, No. 3:99-0338, Slip op. (S.D. \nW.V. July 15,1999).  In that case, the plaintiffs were a group of mentally retarded and \ndevelopmentally delayed individuals who were eligible for benefits under the West Virginia \nMedicaid Plan.  West Virginia, like Arkansas, participates in both the ICFI MR program and the \nHCBS program.  The plaintiffs expressed a preference to receive services under the HCBS \nwaiver program (equal to the ACS waiver in Arkansas).  They requested applications, but were \nplaced on a \"waiting list\" for an indefinite period oftime.  For this reason, the plaintiffs filed \n25 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 8     Filed 07/29/2003     Page 26 of 30 \nclaims pursuant to 42 U.S.c. § 1983, and alleged that the defendant's policies and procedures \ndenied potential applicants the opportunity to apply for medical assistance.  Id. at 21. \nThe district court granted preliminary injunctive relief to the plaintiffs on this claim.  It \nfound that West Virginia had no clear policies, procedures, or forms regarding applications under \nthe waiver program.  C~itical elements of application policies and procedures had not been \nreduced to writing, such as criteria for ranking individuals placed by the State on a \"waiting list\" \nfor services.  Individuals were discouraged from applying unless the State thought they were \neligible, and no one was given the fully-completed application packet required by the State \nunless they were on the waiting list and the State had a slot open and waiting to be filled.  Id. at \nII. \nUnder these facts, virtually identical to our own, the district court concluded that \"[t]hese \npractices violate the statute requiring that 'all individuals wishing to make application for \nmedical assistance under the plan shall have the opportunity to do so.'  42 U.S.c. § 1396a(a)(8). \nThey also violate the corresponding regulations, which provide that '[t]he agency must afford an \nindividual wishing to do so the opportunity to apply for Medicaid without delay.'  42 C.F.R. § \n435.906.\"  Id. at 28.  For these reasons, the district court held that the plaintiffs were likely to \nprevail on this claim, and granted a preliminary injunction.  ld. at 31.  A copy of the Benjamin H. \ndecision is attached hereto and marked as \"Exhibit 4\". \nThe same result was reached in McMillan v. McCrimon, 807 F. Supp. 475 (C.D. Ill. \n1992), in which the plaintiffs were severely disabled persons who were eligible for Medicaid and \nat risk of institutionalization.  They claimed that they would be able to avoid entering an \ninstitution if they could apply for the Illinois HCMS waiver program, but that the State refused to \n26 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 8     Filed 07/29/2003     Page 27 of 30 \naccept their applications.  rd. at 477.  The district court found that the \"opportunity to apply\" \nprovision applies to waiver programs, that the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm without if \nan injunction was not issued, and that the plaintiffs established a likelihood of success on the \nmerits of their claim.  rd. at 479-482. \nThe defendants ~ite Makin v. Hawaii, 114 F. Supp. 2d 10 17 (Haw. 1999), in support of \ntheir argument that the plaintiff cannot demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits.  Their \nreliance on Makin is misplaced.  To be sure, Makin involved a situation in which the plaintiffs \ncould not obtain service under the Hawaii HCBS waiver \"because of a lack of state funding for \nthe services.\"  Id. at 1020. \nThe plaintiff understands that the ACS waiver, like the HCBS waiver in Hawaii, contains \na provision which states that: \nThe State will make waiver services available to individuals in the target group up to the \nlesser of the number of individuals indicated as factor C for the waiver year, or the \nnumber authorized by the State legislature for that period of time. \nThe State will inform HCF A in writing of any limit which is less than factor C for that \nWaIver year. \nSee page 106 of the ACS waiver attached to the Briefin Support of Defendants' Response to \nPlaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction as \"Exhibit A\".  Unlike the situation in Makin, the \nArkansas legislature has not limited the number of slots that may be filled under the ACS \nprogram, and the defendants have not informed HCFA (now CMS) of any legislative limit that \nhas been placed on these slots.  Indeed, the Arkansas legislature recently stated that: \nServices which are covered by the Arkansas State Medicaid Program or under the \nAlternative Community Services Waiver Program (ACS) will be utilized to the maximum \nextent possible for any individual who is eligible for Medicaid coverage.  It is the intent \n27 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 8     Filed 07/29/2003     Page 28 of 30 \nof this section that DDS, as a general policy, maximize the use of Medicaid funding \navailable for appropriate services. \n2003 Ark.

North Memorial Medical Center v. Gomez, 59 F.3d 735, 737 (8th Cir. 1995). \nUnder the Medicaid Act, if a state agrees to establish a Medicaid plan that satisfies the \nrequirements of Title XIX, the federal government will pay a specified percentage of the total \namount expended as \"medical assistance\" under the plan.  42 U.S.c. § 1396.  Some Medicaid \nservices are mandatory and must be provided under the plan, and other services are optirnai. \nDOC-UVCNT \nI''J3\"C\"I\" R \nf \n. --'\" W. ~'''f'('~'\\~\\CK \n--'-\"( ,~-;~' ~_ ,,;~;~~'r \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 3     Filed 06/25/2003     Page 2 of 10 \nArkansas Medical Society. Inc. v. Revnolds, 6 F.3d 519, 526 (8th CiT. 1993).  Participation in the \nMedicaid program is voluntary, but if a state chooses to participate, it must do so in accordance \nwith federal statutes and regulations.  Little Rock Family Planning Services. P.A. v. Dalton. 60 \nF.3d 497, 498 (8th CiT. 1995). \nThe federal Department of Health and Human Services is charged with administration of \nthe Medicaid program, and has delegated much of its responsibility to Centers for Medicare & \nMedicaid Services (\"CMS \").  Arkansas participates in the Medicaid program, and Arkansas \nDepartment of Human Services (\"ADHS\") is the state agency charged with administration of the \nMedicaid program in Arkansas.  Pediatric Specialtv Care v. Arkansas Department of Human \nServices, 293 F.3d 472, 475-476 (8th CiT. 2002).  Among the optional services that may be \nprovided by states under the Medicaid Act are intermediate care facility services for mentally \nretarded or developmentally disabled individuals provided in an intermediate care facility for the \nmentally retarded (\"ICF/MR program\").  42 V.S.C. § 1396d(a)(l5).  In addition, as an alternative \nto providing services in an institution under the ICF/MR program, the Medicaid Act gives states \nthe option of providing home and community-based services for mentally retarded and \ndevelopmentally disabled individuals (\"HCBS program).  42 V.S.c. § 1396n. \nADI-IS has chosen to provide services under the ICF/MR program, and an ICF/MR \nprogram is included in the Arkansas State Medicaid Plan (\"State Plan\").  ADHS has also chosen \nto provide services under the HCBS program. and an HCBS program is included in the State \nPlan.  The HCBS program in Arkansas is called the Alternative Community Services Medicaid \nWaiver Program (\"the ACS program\") and is administered by the Division of Developmental \n2 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 3     Filed 06/25/2003     Page 3 of 10 \nDisabilities Services of ADHS.  In its current form, the ACS program provides the full range of \nMedicaid benefits available under the State Plan.  In addition, the ACS program provides case \nmanagement services, consultation services, crisis abatement respite care services, integrated \nsupport services, physical adaptation/adaptive aids, specialized medical supplies, and supported \nemployment services. \nUnder the ACS program approved by CMS, ADHS has agreed to provide ACS services \nto 3,598 unduplicated recipients in state fiscal year 2002/2003, and the same number of \"slots\" \nfor state fiscal year 2003/2004.  As of May 12,2003, the defendants have filled only 2,631 of the \n3,598 \"slots\" available in state fiscal year 2002/2003, and the remaining 967 \"slots\" have not been \nfilled. \nThe plaintiff is a five-year-old girl with Down syndrome, and was born with congenital \nheart defects that have required surgery.  She cannot speak or recognize dangers, resulting in a \nneed for constant supervision.  The plaintiff requires supplemental feeding through a gastrostomy \ntube in order to meet her nutritional needs, and has other developmental and physical disabilities \nresulting from her Down syndrome.  The plaintiffs father would like to enroll her in the ACS \nprogram, and called ADHS in November of2002 and requested an application.  ADHS would \nnot provide the plaintiff or her father with an ACS enrollment application, but told the plaintiffs \nfather that he could submit a Client's Choice form in which he could designate whether he was \ninterested in obtaining services for his daughter under the ACS program or ICF/MR program. \nADHS sent a Client's Choice form to the plaintiffs father, which he prepared on her behalf and \nsent back to ADHS on November 22,2002.  On January 8,2003, ADHS wrote a letter to the \nplaintiffs father in which it acknowledged that it had received his Client's Choice form, and that \n3 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 3     Filed 06/25/2003     Page 4 of 10 \nhis daughter \"has been added to the Request List and currently is number 2285 on the waiver \nrequest list.\" \nADHS refuses to send an ACS enrollment application to the plaintiff or her father, and \nhas merely placed the plaintiff on a \"request list\" for an indefinite period of time despite the fact \nthat there are nearly 1000 unfilled slots under the ACS program,  Based on information and \nreasonable belief, ADHS has taken the same action in response to requests for ACS services \nmade by thousands of other disabled individuals, \nII,  PRELIMINARY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nBy refusing to give the plaintiff an application for ACS services, the defendants have \nviolated, and continue to violate, the plaintiffs rights under 42 U.S.c, § I 396a(a)(8), 42 U.S.c. § \nI 396n(c)(2), 42 U.S.c. § l396a(a)(3), and the procedural due process component of the \nFourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.  For these reasons, the plaintiff \nrequests a preliminary injunction that requires the defendants to give the plaintiff an application \nfor ACS services so that her fatl1er can prepare and submit the application on her behalf; to \nprocess with reasonable promptness the application for ACS services to be submitted by the \nplaintiff; to issue a decision with reasonable promptness in response to the application for ACS \nservices to be filed by the plaintiff; to promptly notify the plaintiff of the decision made by \nADHS with respect to her application for ACS services; to place the plaintiff in the ACS \nprogram with reasonable promptness if she subsequently is determined by ADHS to be eligi ble \nfor ACS services; to provide the plaintiff with a fair hearing, consistent with federal \nconstitutional principles of procedural due process, with respect to any adverse decision made by \n4 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 3     Filed 06/25/2003     Page 5 of 10 \nADHS; and to notifY the plaintiff of her right to a fair hearing, and any mles issued by ADHS \nwith respect to the filing and prosecution of appeals. \nIn Dataphase Systems, Inc. v. C L Systems, Inc., 640 F.2d 109 (8th CiT. 1991) (en banc), \nthe Eighth Circuit identified the following factors which should be considered when preliminary \ninjunctive relief is requested: \n1.  The threat of irreparable harm to the movant; \n2.  The state of the balance between this harm and the injury that granting the \ninjunction will int1ict on other parties litigant; \n3.  The probability that movant will succeed on the merits; and \n4.  The public interest. \nId. at 114.  These factors are not to be considered in isolation.  \"At base, the question is whether \nthe balance of equities so favors the movant that justice requires the court to intervene to \npreserve the status quo until the merits are determined.  The equitable nature of the proceeding \nmandates that the court's approach be t1exible enough to encompass the particular circumstances \nof each case.\"  Id. at 113. \nIn balancing the equities no single factor is determinative.  The likelihood that plaintiff \nultimately will prevail is meaningless in isolation.  In every case, it must be examined in \nthe context of the relative injuries to the parties and the public.  If the chance of \nirreparable injury to the movant should relief be denied is outweighed by the likely injury \nto other parties litigant should the injunction be granted, the moving party faces a heavy \nburden of demonstrating that he is likely to prevail on the merits.  Conversely, where the \nmovant has raised a substantial question and the equities are otherwise strongly in his \nfavor, the showing of success on the merits can be less. \nId.  In the present case, the Dataphase factors militate clearly in favor of the plaintiffs request for \npreliminary injunctive relief. \nA.  THREAT OF IRREPARABLE HARM \n5 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 3     Filed 06/25/2003     Page 6 of 10 \nThe plaintiff, like thousands of other disabled persons in Arkansas who have been \nplaced on the \"request list\", suffers the threat of irreparable harm because the defendants refuse to \ngive her an application for ACS services.  Without an application, the plaintiff has no way of \nreceiving all of the services available under the ACS program.  The plaintiff is eligible for, and \ncurrently receives, services under the States's TEFRA Waiver Program, but those services do not \ninclude many home and community based services available under the ACS program.  Without \nsuch services, the plaintiff will not develop skills that will allow her to achieve her greatest \nfunctional capacity and highest level of independence.  The plaintiff faces a real and substantial \nthreat of irreparable harm. \nB.  BALANCE OF EQUITIES \nThe state of the balance between this harm and the injury that granting an \ninjunction may inflict on the defendants weighs clearly in favor of the plaintiff and her request \nfor preliminary injunctive relief.  If the defendants are ordered to give the plaintiff an application, \nher father can prepare the application on her behalf and submit it to ADHS for appropriate \nconsideration.  Such an injunction will not harm the defendants in any way, and will place the \nplaintiff on the road to receiving ACS services.  To the extent the defendants may argue that \nbudgetary considerations prevent them from filling the open \"slots\" under the ACS program, \"no \nstate may characterize its duty to comply with the requirements of an elective program such as \nMedicaid as constituting a hardship to its citizens.\"  Illinois Hosp. Ass'n v. Illinois Dept. of \nPublic Aid, 576 F. Supp. 360, 371  (N.D. Ill. 1983).  As previously stated, participation in the \nMedicaid program is voluntary, but if a state chooses to participate, it must do so in accordance \nwith federal statutes and regulations.  Dalton, 60 F.3d at 498. \n6 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 3     Filed 06/25/2003     Page 7 of 10 \nC.  PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS ON THE MERITS \nThe plaintiff has a strong probability of success on the merits.  Count I and Count \nII of her Complaint are based on 42 U.S.c. § 13 96a(a)(8), which provides that a state Medicaid \nplan \"must ... provide that all individuals wishing to make application for medical assistance \nunder the plan shall have opportunity to do so, and that such assistance shall be furnished with \nreasonable promptness to all eligible individuals\".  The defendants, while acting under the color \nof state law, have violated this enforceable federal right by refusing to send an ACS enrollment \napplication to the plaintiff, and by placing her on a \"request list\" for an indefinite period of time. \nAlthough the defendants have allowed the plaintiffs father to submit a Client's Choice form on \nbehalf of his daughter, they have placed her on a \"request list\" for an indefinite period of time \nwithout determining if she is eligible for ACS services and entitled to one of the open \"slots\". \nSuch conduct violates the plaintiffs right to an opportunity to apply for Medicaid services, and \nher right to receive Medicaid services with reasonable promptness, as guaranteed by 42 U.S.C. § \n1396a(a)(8).  See Doe v. Chiles, 136 F.3d 709 (lIth Cir. 1998). \nCount III of the plaintiffs Complaint is based on 42 U.S.c. § 1396n(c)(2), which \nprovides that when a state, such as Arkansas, participates in both the rCF IMR program and the \nHCBS program, it must inform eligible individuals about feasible alternatives for the appropriate \nlevel of care, and recipients must be allowed to choose to receive care under the ICF/MR \nprogram or the HCBS program.  The defendants, while acting under the color of state law, have \nviolated this enforceable federal right by depriving the plaintiff of her freedom to choose ACS \nservices under 42 U.S.c. § 1396n(c)(2).  Cramer v. Chiles, 33 F. Supp. 2d 1342, 1352 (S.D. Fla. \n1999). \n7 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 3     Filed 06/25/2003     Page 8 of 10 \nCount IV of the plaintiffs Complaint is based on 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(3), which \nprovides that a state Medicaid plan \"must ... provide for granting an opportunity for a fair \nhearing before the State agency to any individual whose claim for medical assistance under the \nplan is denied or is not acted upon with reasonable promptness\".  The defendants, while acting \nunder the color of state law, have violated this enforceable federal right by not providing the \nplaintiff with an opportunity for a fair hearing before ADHS after they refused to send her father \nan ACS enrollment application, and by placing her on a \"request list\" for an indefinite period of \ntime.  Although the ADHS Office Policy Manual provides a fair hearing with respect to \n\"decisions regarding the eligibility of or receipt of services\", there is no provision of that manual, \nor any other state law or regulation, that provides a fair hearing if ADHS refuses to provide an \nopportunity to apply for ACS services, or fails to act on a request for ACS services with \nreasonable promptness.  The letter sent by ADHS to the plaintiffs father on January 8, 2003, in \nwhich the defendants notified him that his daughter was being placed on a \"request list\", does not \nmake reference to any right the plaintiff has to a fair hearing if her father believes that ADHS has \nnot given her an opportunity to apply for ACS services, or that ADHS has failed to consider her \nrequest with reasonable promptness.  Because the defendants have failed to provide the plaintiff \nwith a right to a fair hearing, they are violating her right to a fair hearing as guaranteed by 42 \nU.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8). \nCount V is essentially identical to Count IV, but is based on the procedural due process \ncomponent of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. \nD.  PUBLIC INTEREST \n8 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 3     Filed 06/25/2003     Page 9 of 10 \nThe public interest will be served by granting temporary injunctive relief in this \ncase.  Clearly, the public interest is served when state agencies like ADHS are enjoined from \ntaking unsound, harmful, and illegal positions that adversely impact the health and welfare of the \ncitizens of this State.  The position taken by the defendants, i.e. their refusal to provide the \nplaintiff and other disabled individuals with applications for ACS services, is unsound, harmful, \nillegal, and contrary to the public interest. \nIII.  CONCLUSION \nFor these reasons, the plaintiffs Motion for Preliminary Injunctive Relief should be \ngranted, and a preliminary injunction should be issued that requires the defendants to give the \nplaintiff an application for ACS services so that her tather can prepare and submit the application \non her behalf; to process with reasonable promptness the application for ACS services to be \nsubmitted by the plaintiff; to issue a decision with reasonable promptness in response to the \napplication for ACS services to be filed by the plaintiff; to promptly notifY the plaintiff of the \ndecision made by ADHS with respect to her application for ACS services; to place the plaintiff in \nthe ACS program with reasonable promptness if she subsequently is determined by ADHS to be \neligible for ACS services; to provide the plaintiff with a fair hearing, consistent with federal \nconstitutional principles of procedural due process, with respect to any adverse decision made by \nADHS; and to notifY the plaintiff of her right to a fair hearing, and any rules issued by ADHS \nwith respect to the filing and prosecution of appeals. \n9 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 3     Filed 06/25/2003     Page 10 of 10 \nRespectfully submitted, \nTESSA G., A MINOR, BY AND THROUGH \nHER FATHER AND NATURAL GUARDIAN, \nMARK G., Plaintiff \nARMSTRONG ALLEN, PLLC \n100 Morgan Keegan Drive \nSuite 100 \nLittle Rock, AR  72202 \n(501) 280-0100 \n(SOl) 280-0  6 (facsimile) \nBy: \n10 ",

Defendant Arkansas Department of Human Services (\"ADHS\") is an agency of \nthe State of Arkansas. \n3.  Detendant Kurt Knickrehm is the Director of ADHS, and is a resident of Pulaski \nCounty, Arkansas. \n4.  Defendant James Green, Ph.D. is the Director of the Division of Developmental \nDisabilities Services (\"DDS\") of ADHS, and based on information and reasonable belief is a \nresident of Pulaski County, Arkansas. \n5.  The plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, \nand contends that the defendants have violated, and continue to violate, her rights under 42 \nU.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8), 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(2), 42 US.C. § 1396a(a)(3), and the procedural due \nprocess component of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. \n6.

Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396, et seq., commonly \nreferred to as the Medicaid Act, is a joint federal and state program designed to provide medical \nassistance to qualified persons. \n10.  Under the Medicaid Act, if a state agrees to establish a Medicaid plan that \nsatisfies the requirements of Title XIX, the federal government will pay a specified percentage of \n2 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 1     Filed 06/25/2003     Page 3 of 13 \nthe total amount expended as \"medical assistance\" under the plan. \n11.  Some Medicaid services are mandatory and must be provided under the plan, and \nother services are optional. \n12.  Participation in the Medicaid program is voluntary, but if a state chooses to \nparticipate, it must do so in accordance with federal statutes and regulations. \n13.  The federal Department of Health and Human Services is charged with \nadministration of the Medicaid program, and has delegated much of its responsibility to Centers \nfor Medicare & Medicaid Services (\"CMS\"). \n14.  Arkansas participates in the Medicaid program, and ADHS is the state agency \ncharged with administration of the Medicaid program in Arkansas. \n15.  Among the optional services available to states under the Medicaid Act are \nintennediate care facility services for mentally retarded or developmentally disabled individuals \nprovided in an intennediate care facility for the mentally retarded (\"ICF/MR program\"). \n16.  In addition, as an alternative to providing services in an institution under the \nICF IMR program, the Medicaid Act gives states the option of providing horne and community-\nbased services for mentally retarded and developmentally disabled individuals (\"HCBS \nprogram\"). \n17.  ADHS has chosen to provide services under the ICF/MR progran1, and an \nICF/MR program is included in the Arkansas State Medicaid Plan (\"State Plan\"). \n18.  ADHS has also chosen to provide services under the HCBS program, and an \nHCBS program is included in the State Plan. \n19.  The HCBS program in Arkansas is called the Alternative Community Services \n, \nJ \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 1     Filed 06/25/2003     Page 4 of 13 \nMedicaid Waiver Program (\"the ACS program\") and is administered by DDS. \n20.  In its current form, the ACS program provides the full range of Medicaid benefits \navailable under the Stale Plan. \n21.  In addition, the ACS program provides case management services, consultation \nservices, crisis abatement respite care services, integrated support services, physical \nadaptation/adaptive aids, specialized medical supplies, and supported employment services. \n22.  Under the ACS program approved by CMS, ADHS has agreed to provide ACS \nservices to 3,598 unduplicated recipients in state fiscal year 2002/2003, and the same number of \n\"slots\" for state fiscal year 200312004. \n23.  As of May 12,2003, the defendants have filled only 2,631 of the 3,598 \"slots\" \navailable in state fiscal year 2002/2003, and the remaining 967 \"slots\" have not been filled. \n24.  The Arkansas legislature has not placed any restriction on the filling ofthese \n\"slots\" by ADHS. \n25.  The plaintiff is a five-year-old girl with Down syndrome, and was born with \ncongenital heart defects that have required surgery.  She cannot speak or recognize dangers, \nresulting in a need for constant supervision.  The plaintiff requires supplemental feeding through \na gastrostomy tube in order to meet her nutritional needs, and has other developmental and \nphysical disabilities resulting from her Down syndrome. \n26.  The plaintiffs father would like to enroll the plaintiff in the ACS program, and \ncalled ADHS in November of2002 and requested an ACS enrollment application. \n27.  ADHS would not provide the plaintiff or her father with an ACS enrollment \napplication, but told the plaintiffs father that he could submit a Client's Choice form in which he \n4 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 1     Filed 06/25/2003     Page 5 of 13 \ncould designate whether he was interested in obtaining services for his daughter under the ACS \nprogram or ICF/MR program. \n28.  ADHS sent a Client's Choice form to the plaintiff's father, which he prepared on \nher behalf and sent back to ADHS on November 22, 2002. \n29.  On January 8, 2003, ADHS wrote a letter to the plaintiff's father in which it \nacknowledged that it had received his Client's Choice form, and that his daughter \"has been \nadded to the Request List and currently is number 2285 on the waiver request list.\" \n30.  ADHS refuses to send an ACS emollment application to the plaintiff or her fatber, \nand has merely placed the plaintiff on a \"request list\" for an indefinite period of time despite the \nfact that there are nearly 1000 unfilled \"slots\" under the ACS program. \n31.  Based on information and reasonable belief, ADHS has taken the same action in \nresponse to requests for ACS services made by thousands of other disabled individuals. \nCOUNT ONE: VIOLATION OF \"OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY\" PROVISION \n32.  Pursuant to 42 U.S.c. § 1396a(a)(8), the State Plan \"must ... provide that all \nindividuals wishing to make application for medical assistance under the plan shall have \nopportunity to do so, and that such assistance shall be furnished with reasonable promptness to \nall eligible individuals\". \n33.  The defendants, while acting under the color of state law, have violated this \nenforceable federal right by refusing to send an ACS emollment application to the plaintiff, and \nby placing her on a \"request list\" for an indefinite period of time. \n34.  Although the defendants have allowed the plaintiffs father to submit a Client's \n5 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 1     Filed 06/25/2003     Page 6 of 13 \nChoice form on behalf of the plaintiff, they have placed her on a \"request list\" for an indefinite \nperiod of time without determining if she is eligible for ACS services and entitled to one of the \nopen \"slots\". \n35.  Under 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8), the plaintiff has a right to receive an ACS \nenrollment application from ADHS so that she can, in turn, submit the application to ADHS for \nappropriate consideration. \n36.  The defendants have violated this right by refusing to provide an ACS enrollment \napplication to the plaintiff, by placing her on a \"request list\" for an indefinite period of time \nwithout determining ifshe is eligible for ACS services and entitled to one of the open \"slots\", \nand by otherwise failing to provide her with a meaningful opportunity to apply for ACS services. \nCOUNT TWO: VIOLATION OF \"REASONABLE PROMPTNESS\" PROVISION \n37.  As stated above, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8) provides that the State Plan \"must ... \nprovide that all individuals wishing to make application for medical assistance under the plan \nshall have opportunity to do so, and that such assistance shall be furnished with reasonable \npromptness to all eligible individuals\". \n38.  The defendants, while acting under the color of state law, have violated this \nenforceable federal right by refusing to send an ACS enrollment application to the plaintiff, and \nby placing her on a \"request list\" for an indefinite period of time. \n39.  Although the defendants have allowed the plaintiff's father to submit a Client's \nChoice form on behalf of the plaintiff, they have placed her on a \"request list\" for an indefinite \nperiod of time without determining if she is eligible for ACS services and entitled to one of the \n6 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 1     Filed 06/25/2003     Page 7 of 13 \nopen \"slots\". \n40.  Under 42 U.S.c. § 1396a(a)(8), the plaintiff has the right to receive an ACS \nemollment application from ADHS, to submit the application to ADHS, and to have ADHS \nconsider her application with reasonable promptness. \n41.  The defendants have violated these rights by refusing to provide an ACS \nemollment application to the plaintiff, by placing the plaintiff on a \"request list\" for an indefinite \nperiod of time without determining if she is eligible for ACS services and entitled to one of the \nopen \"slots\", and by otherwise failing to provide ACS services to the plaintiff with reasonable \npromptness. \nCOUNT THREE: VIOLATION OF \"FREEDOM OF CHOICE\" PROVISION \n42.  Pursuant to 42 U.S.c. § 1396n(c)(2), when a state, such as Arkansas, participates \nin both the ICF/MR program and the HCBS program, it must inform eligible individuals about \nfeasible alternatives for the appropriate level of care, and recipients must be allowed to choose to \nreceive care under the ICF IMR program or the HCBS program. \n43.  The defendants, while acting under the color of state law, have violated this \nenforceable federal right by refusing to send an ACS emollment application to the plaintiff, and \nby placing her on a \"request list\" for an indefinite period of time. \n44.  Although the defendants have allowed the plaintiffs father to submit a Client's \nChoice form on behalf of the plaintiff, they have placed her on a \"request list\" for an indefinite \nperiod of time without determining if she is eligible for ACS services and entitled to one of the \nopen \"slots\". \n7 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 1     Filed 06/25/2003     Page 8 of 13 \n45.  Under 42 U.S.c. § 1396n(c)(2), the plaintiff has the right to choose between \nservices under the ICF/MR program and services under the HCBS program. \n46.  The defendants have violated this right by failing to provide an ACS enrollment \napplication to the plaintiff, by placing her on a \"request list\" for an indefinite period of time \nwithout determining if she is eligible for ACS services and entitled to one of the open \"slots\", \nand by otherwise depriving her ofthe freedom to choose between services under the ICF/MR \nprogram or HCBS program. \nCOUNT FOUR: VIOLATION OF \"FAIR HEARING\" PROVISION \n47.  Pursuant to 42 U.S.c. § 1396a(a)(3), the State Plan \"must ... provide for granting \nan opportunity for a fair hearing before the State agency to any individual whose claim for \nmedical assistance under the plan is denied or is not acted upon with reasonable promptness\". \n48.  The defendants, while acting under the color of state law, have violated this \nenforceable federal right by not providing the plaintiff with an opportunity for a fair hearing \nbefore ADHS after they refused to send her father an ACS enrollment application, and by \nplacing her on a \"request list\" for an indefinite period of time. \n49.  Although the ADHS Office Policy Manual provides a fair hearing with respect to \n\"decisions regarding the eligibility of or receipt of services\", there is no provision of that manual, \nor any other state law or regulation, that provides a fair hearing if ADHS refuses to provide an \nopportunity to apply for ACS services, or fails to act on a request for ACS services with \nreasonable promptness. \n50.  The letter sent by ADHS to the plaintiffs father on January 8, 2003, in which the \n8 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 1     Filed 06/25/2003     Page 9 of 13 \ndefendants notified him that the plaintiff was being placed on a \"request list\", does not make \nreference to any right she has to a fair hearing if her father believes that ADHS has not given her \nan opportunity to apply for ACS services, or that ADHS has failed to consider her request with \nreasonable promptness. \n51.  Under 42 U.S.c. § I 396a(a)(3), the plaintiff has a right to a fair hearing ifher \nfather believes that ADHS has failed to give her an opportunity to apply for ACS services, or that \nADHS has failed to consider her request with reasonable promptness. \n52.  The defendants have violated this right by failing to provide a fair hearing to the \nplaintiff after they refused to send her an ACS enrollment application, and placing her on a \n\"request list\" for an indefinite period of time. \nCOUNT FIVE: VIOLATION OF PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS \n53.  Under the procedural due process component of the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States, the plaintiff is entitled to notice and an opportunity for a fair \nhearing with respect to her request for ACS services. \n54.  The defendants, while acting under the color of state law, have deprived the \nplaintiff of her federal constitutional right to procedural due process by not providing her with an \nopportunity for a fair hearing after they refused to send her an ACS enrollment application, and \nplacing her on a \"request list\" for an indefinite period of time. \n55.  Although the ADHS Office Policy Manual provides a fair hearing with respect to \n\"decisions regarding the eligibility of or receipt of services\", there is no provision of that manual, \nor any other state law or regulation, that provides a fair hearing if ADHS refuses to provide an \n9 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 1     Filed 06/25/2003     Page 10 of 13 \nopportunity to apply for ACS services, or fails to act on a request for ACS services with \nreasonable promptness. \n56.  The letter sent by ADHS to the plaintiffs father on January 8,2003, in which the \ndefendants notified him that his daughter was being placed on a \"request list\", does not make \nreference to any right she has to a fair hearing if her father believes that ADHS has not given her \nan opportunity to apply for ACS services, or that ADHS has failed to consider her request with \nreasonable promptness. \n57.  Under the procedural due process component of the Fuurteenth Amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States, the plaintiff has a right to a fair hearing if her father believes \nthat ADHS has failed to give her an opportunity to apply for ACS services, or that ADHS has \nfailed to consider her request with reasonable promptness. \n58.  The defendants have violated this right by failing to provide a fair hearing to the \nplaintiff after they refused to send her an A CS emollment application, and placing her on a \n\"request list\" for an indefinite period oftime. \nJURY DEMAND \n59.  The plaintiff hereby demands a jury trial with respect to all issues of fact, triable \nby jury, which may arise herein. \nWHEREFORE, the plaintiff, Tessa G., a minor, by and through her father and natural \nguardian, Mark G., prays for the following relief: \na.  That the Court determine that the defendants have violated, and continue to \nviolate, the plaintiffs rights under 42 U.S.c. § 1396a(a)(8), 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(2), 42 U.S.c. § \n10 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 1     Filed 06/25/2003     Page 11 of 13 \nI 396a(a)(3), and the procedural due process component of the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States, as alleged herein; \nb.  That the Court issue an injunction that requires the defendants to give the plaintiff \nan application for ACS services so that her father can prepare and submit the application on her \nbehalf; \nc.  That the Court issue an injunction that requires the defendants to process with \nreasonable promptness the application for ACS services to be submitted by the plaintiff; \nd.  That the Court issue an injunction that requires the defendants to issue a decision \nwith reasonable promptness in response to the application for ACS services to be filed by the \nplaintiff; \ne.  That the Court issue an injunction that requires the defendants to promptly notify \nthe plaintiff of the decision made by ADHS with respect to her application for ACS services; \nf.  That the Court issue an injunction that requires the defendants to place the \nplaintiff in the ACS program with reasonable promptness if she subsequently is determined by \nADHS to be eligible for ACS services; \ng.  That the Court issue an injunction that requires the defendants to provide the \nplaintiff with a fair hearing, consistent with federal constitutional principles of procedural due \nprocess, with respect to any adverse decision made by ADHS; \nh.  That the Court issue an injunction that requires the defendants to notify the \nplaintiff of her right to a fair hearing, and any rules issued by ADHS with respect to the filing \nand prosecution of appeals; \nThat the Court award the plaintiff and her father their costs herein expended; \nl. \n11 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE     Document 1     Filed 06/25/2003     Page 12 of 13 \nJ.  That the Court award the plaintiff and her father their reasonable attorney fees \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988; and \nk.

In response to paragraph 5 of plaintiffs complaint, defendants admit that \nplaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief but deny that plaintiff is entitled to relief, \nand further deny that defendants have violated any of plaintiff s legally protected rights. \n3.  In response to paragraph 6 of plaintiffs complaint, defendants admit that 28 \nU.S.C. § 1331 vests the Court with federal question jurisdiction, but deny that this \ncomplaint gives rise to such jurisdiction. \n4.

That pilot \nproject, which was limited to ten counties, had a cap of 300 recipients.  In 1992 the state \nrequested and received federal permission to put the DD waiver into effect statewide and \nexpand the cap to 472.  Subsequent expansions increased the cap to 564, 623, and then to \n600.  As the economy and state funding improved in the mid 1990's, the cap increased \ndramatically, doubling in 1995.  Additional expansions occurred each year, and by 1999 \nthere were 2,404 slots.  As of July 1,2003, the cap was 3,5981 and 2,644 individuals were \n1 Counsel apologize for errors in the numbers previously supplied. \n\n•  • \nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE  Document 9  Filed 08107/2003  Page 2 of 8 \nenrol1ed as DD waiver service recipients.  Also as of July 1,2003, plaintiff was number \n2,252 on the DD waiver waiting list. \nDuring the recent state budget deficits in which many Medicaid and other state \nprograms were frozen or cutback, the Department of Human Services and DD waiver \nproviders fought hard for the expanded funding necessary to fill all DD waiver slots. \nThat request is notable not only because it was made during difficult economic times, but \nalso because the DD waiver was the only Medicaid program for which such a request was \nmade.  The Arkansas General Assembly responded by providing additional appropriation, \nmostly in the second year of the biennium, for all 3,598 DD waiver slots.  Though the \nadditional appropriation is insufficient to fund all the vacant DD waiver slots at once, it \nwill support a realistic expansion pace allowing providers to hire new staff and take other \nsteps necessary to serve more people while retaining high quality of care. \nAs all existing DD waiver slots are filled over the course of the 2003-2005 \nbiennium, experience suggests that it is reasonable to predict that seventy-five per cent \n(75%) ofDD waiver applicants will be eligible for waiver services, and that one hundred \n(100) persons will terminate waiver services each year.  If these norms and the DD \nwaiver cap remain constant, then plaintiff should expect waiver services to become \navailable in 2013.  (22522 minus 954 open slots3 = 1298.  1298 multiplied by 75% = \n973.5.)  Thus Tessa could expect to be 973 on the list on July 1,2005,873 on the list on \nJuly 1, 2006, and so on. Of course, that is not a desirable outcome.  Hopeful] y the \nArkansas General Assembly will fund additional cap expansions to enable the list to \nmove more quickly and to enable Tessa to be served much sooner. \n2 Tessa's position on the waiting list. \n3 All open slots, including presently occupied slots that are vacated, will be fiJled during the current \nbiennium ending June 30, 2005. \n2 \n\n•  • \nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE  Document 9  Filed 08107/2003  Page 3 of 8 \n, \nThis brief history of the DD waiver shows that the Department of Human \nServices has remained committed to providing waiver services to the extent permitted by \nfunding, the cap, and other practical considerations.  As a result, the waiver program has \ngrown much faster than the Medicaid program as a whole.  For example, the number of \npersons receiving waiver services increased from 1,565 to 2,644 from 1999 to present. \nDuring that time, overall Medicaid expenditures increased by 166% while waiver \nexpenditures increased by approximately 254%.  See attachment \"A.\" \nTurning to some specific arguments made by plaintiff, it is undisputed that 42 \nv.S.c. § 1396a (a)(8) declares that a state plan for medical assistance must: \"provide that \nall individuals wishing to make application for medical assistance under the plan shall \nhave opportunity to do so, and that such assistance shall be furnished with reasonable \npromptness to all eligible individuals.\"  Inherent in this statute is the assumption that all \nservices under the plan are always available.  Waiver services in excess of the cap are not \navailable to plaintiff.  Nevertheless, plaintiff was enrolled for DD waiver services and \ntreated as if she is eligible.  She will remain on the enrollment list, will keep her place in \nline for DD waiver services as they become available, and the Department of Human \nServices will promptly determine her eligibility (i.e., within 90 days as required by 42 \nC.F.R. §435.911) based on the date that DD waiver services become available. \nIgnoring that DD waiver services are not currently available to plaintiff, and \nassuming that: (1) an eligibility detennination made today would establish that plaintiff is \neligible for DD waiver services; (2) plaintiff remains eligible when DD waiver services \nbecome available; then an eligibility determination made today will have no positive \neffect.  In other words, if eligibility is determined today, that Medicaid determination will \n3 \n\n•  • \nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE  Document 9  Filed 08107/2003  Page 4 of 8 \nr \nbe useless when DD waiver services become available, because the determination will \nnot establish relevant eligibility: eligibility that is contemporaneous with service delivery. \nIf the DD waiver remains in place and plaintiff is eligible when services become \navailable, Medicaid will make reimbursement based on a timely and prompt eligibility \ndetermination. \nThough plaintiff can reap no benefit from an eligibility determination made today, \nshe can be harmed.  That is because the only way for the Department of Human Services \nto give effect to a determination of ineligibility is to remove plaintiff from DD waiver \nenrollment, causing plaintiff to lose her place in line.  Ifplaintiffs condition then \ndeteriorates she must reapply and be assigned a new place in line.  The existing process \ntherefore treats potential waiver recipients favorably compared to the immediate and \nbinding eligibility determination sought by plaintiff \nBecause a positive eligibility determination that is made before senrices are \navailable has no effect, the detennination is a nullity and a futile act  Only a negative \neligibility determination can have effect, albeit an effect adverse to the applicant \nTherefore to the extent that any pre-service eligibility determination has consequences, \nthose consequences are undesirable.  To avoid undesirable consequences the state would \nhave to discard all negative eligibility determinations.  As a result, each eligibility \ndetermination made before services are available is useless.  Because it is axiomatic that \nstatutes should not be read to compel a futile or useless thing4, the Medicaid statute \nshould not be read to compel eligibility determinations for services that are not available. \nPlaintiff has cited decisions holding that states must take applications, determine \neligibility, and provide services for available waiver positions, a point with which the \n4 Flynn v. Commissioner ofI nternal Revenue, 77 F.2d 180, 183 (5th eir. 1935). \n4 \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00•493- GTE  Document 9  Filed 0810•7/20 03  Page 5 of 8 \n• \nstate agrees.  However, plaintiff has cited no authority to establish that applications must \nbe taken for services that are not available.  The only authority relevant to that point is \nMakin ex rei. Russell v. Hawaii, 114 F. Supp.2d 1017 (D. Ha. 1999), which holds that \nMedicaid imposes no obligations to states to furnish waiver services in excess of the \nwaIver cap. \nPlaintiff claims that she will be irreparably harmed by not receiving DD waiver \nservices before they become available.  However, plaintiff is already eligible to receive \nany medically necessary service that is defined as medical assistance in 42 U.S.c. § \n1396d (a), including \"medical care, or any other type of remedial care recognized under \nState law, furnished by licensed practitioners within the scope of their practice as defined \nby State law\" and \"other diagnostic, screening, preventive, and rehabilitative services, \nincluding any medical or remedial services ... recommended by a physician or other \nlicensed practitioner of the healing arts within the scope of their practice under State law, \nfor the maximum reduction of physical or mental disability and restoration of an \nindividual to the best possible functional level.\"  42 U.S.c. § 1396d (a)(6) and 42 U.S.c. \n§ 1396d (a)(l3), respectively.  Plaintiff does not identify any particular DD waiver \nservice that does not meet these definitions but must be received to avoid irreparable \nharm.  However, plaintiff does state that DD waiver services will provide experiences \ns\nthat will enrich plaintiffs Iife . Defendants cannot agree that the lack of taxpayer funded \nenrichment experiences equates to irreparable harm, particularly when such enrichment is \nnot covered by private insurance plans.  Furthermore, plaintiff sidesteps the fact that her \nparents have the ability to purchase such services for her if they wish, thereby avoiding \nany irreparable harm. \n~ Reply to Response to Motion for Preliminary Injunctive Relief, p. 18. \n5 \n\n•  • \nCase 4:03-cv-00493-GTE  Document 9  Filed 08107/2003  Page 6 of 8 \n\" \nPutting all this aside for the moment, the fact remains that there is no imminent \nharm to plaintiff that can be redressed by a preliminary injunction unless plaintiff is \nplaced ahead of hundreds of persons who enrolled before she did.  Plaintiff has not \nexplicitly requested that relief, which would cause manifest inequities for which there is \nneither authority nor logic.  Accordingly, defendants ask the Court to deny plaintiffs \nmotion for preliminary injunction. \nRespectfully submitted, \nBy: \nMARK A.
