    "summary": "<p>On April 16, 1992, providers and recipients, or potential recipients, of State of California Medicaid-funded drug abuse treatment services filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the California Department of Alcohol and Drugs Programs, California Health and Welfare Agency, California Department of Health Services, and Alameda County.  Plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, asked the court for injunctive and declaratory relief, claiming that California's federally-funded Medi-Cal drug abuse program was not being administered consistently with the Medicaid Act (42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq.).  Specifically, Plaintiffs claimed that methadone maintenance was wholly unavailable to residents of certain counties because the State allowed counties to determine whether and in what amount to provide such services.  Further, Plaintiffs alleged that levels of service were often insufficient even in those counties were methadone maintenance was offered.</p><p>The Court (Judge David F. Levi) certified a class as \"all persons in the State of California eligible for Medi-Cal for whom methadone maintenance treatment is medically necessary and otherwise appropriate but how are, or may in the future be, unable to obtain methadone maintenance treatment through the Medi-Cal program\" on September 15, 1992.</p><p>On December 8, 1992, the Court related case this case, 2:92-cv-613, with case 2:92-cv-1905.</p><p>On June 14, 1994, the Court (Judge David F. Levi) issued an amended memorandum of decision and order.  Sobkey v. Smoley, 855 F.Supp. 1123 (E.D. Cal. 1994).  Plaintiffs had moved for summary judgment and for reconsideration.  The Court held that: Plaintiff had enforceable rights under § 1983; Medicaid recipients were entitled to a preliminary injunction; Plaintiffs were not entitled to summary judgment; the state practice did not violate the equal access provision of the Medicaid Act; the state's failure to fund enough methadone maintenance slots violated the needy equal treatment required; the state's practice violated the Medicaid requirement that services be provided with reasonable promptness; and, Plaintiffs' due process rights were not violated.</p><p>The Court issued a permanent injunction on August 22, 1994.  The Court had previously issued a preliminary injunction, but its contents are unclear.  The permanent injunction required Defendants to: refrain from violating 42 U.S.C. § 1396 in provision of methadone and methadone maintenance serviced under the Medi-Cal program; take all practicable steps to assure contracts between counties and the Department of Alcohol/Drug Programs; provide written notice to all methadone maintenance programs of the availability of state hearings; and, to submit a plan regarding Defendants' proposed method of complying with the injunction.</p><p>On March 27, 1995, the Court issued an order settling Plaintiffs' claim for attorneys' fees and costs.  The exact amount of the award is unclear.</p><p>Defendants filed reports for a period of time, but there has been no further litigation.</p><p></p>",

      "text": "855 F.Supp. 1123 (1994)\nReda Z. SOBKY, M.D., PhD., et al., Plaintiffs,\nv.\n[1]\nSandra R. SMOLEY,  et al., Defendants.\nCiv. No. S-92-613 DFL GGH.\nUnited States District Court, E.D. California.\nJune 14, 1994.\n111111222456 *1124*1125*1126 Amitai Schwartz, San Francisco, CA, for plaintiffs.\nJoseph Owens Egan, Attorney General's Office, State of Cal., Sacramento, CA, for defendants.\nAMENDED MEMORANDUM OF DECISION AND ORDER\nLEVI, District Judge.\n[2]\nPlaintiffs are providers and recipients or potential recipients of Medi-Cal funded drug abuse treatment services.\nPlaintiffs claim that the State of California is administering its federally funded Medi-Cal drug abuse program\nunder an administrative and statutory scheme that fails to comply with the requirements of Title XIX of the Social\nSecurity Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396 et seq. (the \"Medicaid Act\"). In particular, plaintiffs object to the State's practice\nof allowing the counties to determine whether and in what amount to provide Medi-Cal funded methadone\nmaintenance treatment services. Plaintiffs contend that as a result of this system methadone maintenance is\nwholly unavailable under Medi-Cal for residents of some California counties. Moreover, in counties where\ntreatment is available, plaintiffs aver that the level of service provided is insufficient to meet the need and that\npatients are placed on waiting lists for Medi-Cal funded \"treatment slots.\" In contrast, other Medi-Cal covered\nservices are available upon presentment of a Medi-Cal card to a licensed provider. Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief\nthrough this action brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. This Amended Memorandum of Decision and Order, issued\nupon plaintiffs' further motion for summary judgment and motion for reconsideration, supersedes the court's\nprevious opinion of October 26, 1993.\nI. Background\n[3]\nThe federal Medicaid program provides federal funds to states to pay for medical treatment for the needy.\nSchweiker v. Gray Panthers, 453 U.S. 34, 36, 101 S.Ct. 2633, 2636, 69 L.Ed.2d 460 (1981). State participation is\noptional, but states that choose to participate must submit a state plan that fulfills the requirements of the\nMedicaid Act. 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(b). For a state plan to be approved, the plan must comply with 58 conditions set\nforth in 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a). California has elected to participate in the federal Medicaid program through its\nCalifornia Medical Assistance Program, known as \"Medi-Cal,\" which provides medical services to the aged,\n1127 disabled, and indigent.[4]*1127Citizens Action League v. Kizer, 887 F.2d 1003, 1005 (9th Cir.1989),cert. denied,\n494 U.S. 1056, 110 S.Ct. 1524, 108 L.Ed.2d 764 (1990); Cal.Welf. & Inst.Code §§ 14000-14196.\nFederal law does not require that states provide methadone maintenance services in their Medicaid plans. It is an\noptional service. But once a state elects to provide an optional service such as methadone maintenance, that\nservice becomes part of the state Medicaid plan and is subject to the requirements of federal law. Weaver v.\nReagen, 886 F.2d 194, 197 (8th Cir.1989); Eder v. Beal, 609 F.2d 695, 701-02 (3d Cir. 1979); Clark v. Kizer, 758\nF.Supp. 572, 575 (E.D.Cal.1990),aff'd in part and vacated in part on other grounds sub nom., Clark v. Coye, 967\nF.2d 585 (9th Cir.1992) (table); see also King v. Smith, 392 U.S. 309, 316, 88 S.Ct. 2128, 2133, 20 L.Ed.2d 1118\n(1968). Methadone maintenance is one of several drug abuse treatment services offered as part of California's\n\n[5]\n\"Drug/Medi-Cal\" program.  Cal.Welf. & Inst.Code §§ 14021(c), 14021.5 & 14131; Cal.Code Regs. tit. 22, §\n51341; Dep. of Venus Little, 34:24-35:1.\nMedi-Cal is generally administered on a \"fee-for-service\" basis by the California Department of Health Services.\nTo receive services, Medi-Cal recipients present Medi-Cal cards to certified providers of authorized treatments or\nservices. Cal.Welf. & Inst. Code § 14018; Cal.Code Regs. tit. 22, §§ 50731 & 50733(a); see also Defs.'\n[6]\nStatement of Material Facts, ¶ 7.  The provider then bills the State a pre-established fee for that service. Defs.'\nStatement of Material Facts, ¶ 8. The Medi-Cal card is \"authorization for payment for Medi-Cal covered services\nreceived in any California county.\" Cal.Code Regs. tit. 22, § 50735(a). In the fee-for-service scheme, the counties'\nrole is primarily to determine recipients' eligibility in accordance with State regulations. Id. § 50101.\nMethadone maintenance is a method of treating dependence on opiates, including heroin. Methadone is a\nsynthetic drug that relieves the symptoms of opiate withdrawal, and is itself addictive. Maintenance treatment\nincludes prescription of methadone under medical supervision, drug screening, therapy, and vocational and\nsubstance abuse counselling. 21 C.F.R. §§ 291.505(a)(2) & 291.505(d)(4)(i)(A); Cal.Health & Safety Code §\n11880. The ultimate goal of the treatment is to eliminate all dependence on drugs. Id. § 11880. Methadone\nmaintenance providers are licensed for a maximum treatment capacity (called \"treatment slots\") by the California\nDepartment of Alcohol and Drug Programs (the \"Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs\" or the \"Department\")\nwhich acts after receiving a recommendation from the county in which the provider seeks to operate. Id. § 11877;\nCal.Code Regs. tit. 9, §§ 10026, 10040 & 10045; Decl. of Joy Jarfors, ¶ 3. No provider may treat more than 300\npatients at a time. Cal.Code Regs. tit. 9, §§ 10026(b) & 10145(b). To receive treatment, patients must meet\nfederal and state eligibility criteria, for example, patients must have a documented history of at least two years of\nnarcotic addiction. 21 C.F.R. § 291.505(d); Cal.Code Regs. tit. 9, § 10174.\nCalifornia's Medicaid plan governing the provision of drug abuse treatment services consists of an interagency\nagreement between the Department of Health Services and the Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs. See\nDefs.' Ex. 1. Under the agreement, provision of Medi-Cal funded methadone maintenance treatment is integrated\n1128 *1128 into California's separate statutory scheme governing drug abuse services. The key feature of California's\ndrug abuse scheme is that services are administered through locally controlled community drug abuse programs,\nin which each individual county is vested with the discretion to determine the appropriate mix and level of drug\n[7]\nabuse services needed in the community.  Cal.Health & Safety Code § 11960; Defs.' Opp'n to first\nSumm.J.Mot. at 9-10. Each county may, but is not required to, seek funds allocated by the Department of Alcohol\nand Drug Programs for the purpose of alleviating drug abuse problems within its jurisdiction. Cal.Health & Safety\nCode § 11981. The Department annually estimates the total amount of State and federal funds available to each\ncounty for drug abuse services. Id. § 11983. Each county then prepares its own drug program plan, subject to\nState approval, which specifies the particular amount and type of drug abuse services which will be offered in that\ncounty. Id. §§ 11983.2 & 11983.1. Counties may choose to include any of the Drug/Medi-Cal services, including\nmethadone maintenance, in their plans. If they do, State \"matching\" funds for the Drug/Medi-Cal services are\ndeducted from the State general fund monies already allocated to the county for its drug programs. Id. § 11987.3.\n[8]\n If the county chooses not to include Drug/Medi-Cal services in its plan, then all of the State general fund\n[9]\nmonies allocated to the county are available for other services specified in the county's drug program plan. Id.\n§§ 11987.3 & 11987.4; see also Dep. of Dana Kueffner, 30:14-35:15; Dep. of Robert Lefkin, 40:11-47:5,\n48:24-49:14.\nBased on the amount of money allocated in the county plan to methadone maintenance, the counties contract\nwith methadone maintenance providers for a specific dollar amount of treatment services, which in turn translates\n[10]\ninto a number of available Medi-Cal funded \"treatment slots.\"  Cal.Welf. & Inst.Code § 14021(c); Decl. of\nDonald Nikkel, ¶¶ 5-7; Kueffner Dep., 53:1-55:5.\nAs a result of this system, Medi-Cal methadone maintenance services are available only in those California\n[11]\ncounties that elect to receive Medi-Cal funds for that purpose.  Defs.' Statement of Disputed Facts, ¶ 14. Only\n18 of the 58 counties in California have elected to fund Medi-Cal methadone maintenance. Def. Molly Joel Coye's\nResp. to Pls.' Second Set of Interrogs., No. 4. In all but eight of the non-participating counties, there is no certified\n1129 methadone maintenance provider for either Medi-Cal recipients or private pay patients. Jarfors Decl., ¶ 7.[12] In \n\n*1129 the eight 00 which includes Sonoma, San Diego, Ventura, Santa Barbara, Kern, and San Luis Obispo\n97\nCounties 00 certified methadone maintenance providers serve private pay patients and patients subsidized under\n97\nother programs, such as federal block grants, but do not receive any funding through Medi-Cal. Lefkin Dep.,\n49:5-14, 50:10-13.\nIf a county does not provide Medi-Cal methadone maintenance services, or if the county provides the service but\nthe available \"slots\" are filled, then a Medi-Cal eligible individual cannot receive the service in that county under\n[13]\nMedi-Cal. Little Dep. at 27-29, 47. Although the practice is contrary to State policy, see Pls.' Ex. 18, at least\ntwo counties include clauses in their provider contracts prohibiting providers from serving Medi-Cal patients who\nreside in other counties.

Plaintiffs also have submitted declarations from\nseveral Medi-Cal eligible methadone maintenance patients who are unable to obtain Medi-Cal services because\nof their county of residence, or who were obtaining services but were terminated from Medi-Cal funded treatment\nslots due to insufficient Drug/Medi-Cal funding. Decls. of Douglas Lipman, Vicki Manahl, Sharon McCloud, Lisa\nQuilling, Terri Randall, Heather Randolph, Paul Sanchez, Jodi Sollenberger. These persons are \"categorically\nneedy\" within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(A) because they receive Aid to Families with Dependent\nChildren (\"AFDC\") or because they receive SSI. See id. Unlike other categorically needy persons and some\n\"medically needy\" individuals who receive methadone maintenance treatment through Medi-Cal, see Decl. of\nAnne Bolla; Second Decl. of Amitai Schwartz (incorporating letter from Ron Kletter), these members of the\nplaintiff class must either privately pay for methadone maintenance or forego treatment while they wait for Medi-\nCal funded treatment slots to become available. As a result, they have suffered consequences such as\nhomelessness, exposure to disease, medical complications resulting in hospitalization, and the risk of probation\n[15]\nrevocation.  Decls. of Douglas Lipman, Vicki Manahl, Sharon McCloud, Lisa Quilling, Terri Randall, Heather\nRandolph, Paul Sanchez, Jodi Sollenberger; see also Slattery Decl., ¶ 13; Decl. of Ronald K. Perry.\nPlaintiffs assert that the State's scheme for providing Medi-Cal funded methadone maintenance treatment\n1130 violates six requirements of the Medicaid statute: (1) the State's *1130 Medicaid plan must be in effect statewide,\n42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(1); (2) payments to providers must be sufficient so that Medi-Cal recipients receive\ncomparable services as the general population in the geographic area, id. § 1396a(a)(30); (3) the State's\nMedicaid plan must provide medical assistance to categorically needy individuals that is equal in amount,\nduration, and scope to the assistance provided to other categorically needy persons and at least equal in amount,\nduration, and scope to the assistance provided to medically needy persons, id. § 1396a(a)(10)(B); (4) each\nservice must be sufficient in amount, duration, and scope to reasonably achieve its purpose, 42 C.F.R. § 440.230\n(b); (5) the plan must be administered or supervised by a single state agency, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(5); and (6)\nmedical assistance under the plan must be furnished to all eligible individuals with reasonable promptness, id. §\n[16]\n1396a(a)(8).  Plaintiffs seek summary judgment on these claims, or in the alternative, a preliminary injunction\ninvalidating the State scheme.\n[17]\nDefendants seek to dismiss both the Sobky and Merritt complaints in their entirety.  Defendants assert that\nplaintiffs have no right of action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to enforce the Medicaid plan requirements of the Social\nSecurity Act against the State. Further, defendants seek either summary judgment or dismissal as to plaintiffs'\nclaim asserting a violation of due process.\nII. Jurisdiction\nRelief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 is not limited to federal constitutional violations but also may be based on\nviolations of a federal statute. Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 6-8, 100 S.Ct. 2502, 2505-06, 65 L.Ed.2d 555\n(1980). But because § 1983 is addressed to the deprivation of \"rights, privileges or immunities\" and not merely\n\n[18]\nthe violation of federal law,  a plaintiff must show that the federal law violated creates enforceable rights within\nthe meaning of § 1983. Golden State Transit Corp. v. City of Los Angeles, 493 U.S. 103, 106, 110 S.Ct. 444, 448,\n[19]\n107 L.Ed.2d 420 (1989).\nThe two most recent Supreme Court decisions addressing whether a statutory provision creates enforceable\n1131 rights, Wilder v. Virginia Hosp. Ass'n, 496 U.S. 498, 110 S.Ct. *1131 2510, 110 L.Ed.2d 455 (1990), and Suter v.\nArtist M., ___ U.S. ___, 112 S.Ct. 1360, 118 L.Ed.2d 1 (1992), have led to a degree of uncertainty because of\n[20]\ntheir varying approaches.  In Wilder, 496 U.S. at 509-10, 110 S.Ct. at 2517, the Court found that § 1396a(a)\n(13) of the Medicaid Act 00 which requires a state Medicaid plan to provide for \"reasonable rates\" of payment for\n97\n[21]\nservices 00 created a right enforceable by health care providers against the State under § 1983. Wilder applied\n97\nthe analytical framework first set out in Golden State. Under this framework, whether an enforceable federal right\nexists depends, first, on whether the statute in question is \"intended to benefit\" the plaintiff seeking to enforce it. \nWilder, 496 U.S. at 509, 110 S.Ct. at 2517. If so, then the provision creates an enforceable right unless it merely\nexpresses a \"congressional preference\" rather than a binding, mandatory obligation on the state, or unless the\ninterest the plaintiff asserts is \"`too vague and amorphous' such that it is `beyond the competence of the judiciary\nto enforce.'\" Id. (quoting Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 19, 101 S.Ct. 1531, 1541, 67\nL.Ed.2d 694 (1981); Golden State, 493 U.S. at 108, 110 S.Ct. at 449). With little or no discussion of jurisdictional\nissues, a succession of courts, in cases pre-dating Suter (and many even pre-dating Wilder), have routinely\npermitted beneficiary and provider actions under § 1983 to enforce various sections of the Medicaid Act. See,\ne.g., King v. Sullivan, 776 F.Supp. 645 (D.R.I.1991); Clark v. Kizer, 758 F.Supp. 572 (E.D.Cal.1990),aff'd in part\nand vacated in part on other grounds sub nom., Clark v. Coye, 967 F.2d 585 (9th Cir.1992) (table); Linton v.\nCarney, 779 F.Supp. 925 (E.D.Tenn.1990); Morgan v. Cohen, 665 F.Supp. 1164 (E.D.Pa.1987); Kessler v. Blum,\n591 F.Supp. 1013 (S.D.N.Y. 1984); Christy v. Ibarra, 826 P.2d 361 (Colo. 1991).\nIn Suter, ___ U.S. at ___, 112 S.Ct. at 1370, the Court held that child beneficiaries of the Adoption Assistance\n[22]\nand Child Welfare Act (the \"Adoption Act\")  could not enforce the requirement that the states use \"reasonable\nefforts\" to keep children in their homes. Without explicit reference to the Golden State/Wilder approach, the Court\nreturned to its emphasis in Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17, 101 S.Ct. at 1540, that when legislation is enacted under\nCongress' spending power, conditions imposed on the grant of federal money must be expressed\n[23]\n\"unambiguously.\"  After Suter, the critical inquiry focuses on the specificity of the statutory language; the court\nmust \"examine exactly what is required of States\" by the enactment. Suter, ___ U.S. at ___, 112 S.Ct. at 1367.\nEnforceable federal rights may be found when the statute and any implementing regulations \"set forth in some\n1132 detail\" what the state must do to comply, but not when the *1132 method of compliance is left \"within broad limits\"\nto the state itself. Id. at ___, 112 S.Ct. at 1368. The only unambiguous condition that the Adoption Act placed on\nthe states was to require a plan approved by the Secretary \"contain[ing] 16 listed features,\" including the\nrequirement for the states to use \"reasonable efforts\" to maintain children in their own homes. Id. at ___, 112\nS.Ct. at 1367. But the \"reasonable efforts\" feature itself \"impose[s] only a rather generalized duty on the State,\" a\nduty not specific enough to qualify as a privately enforceable right. Id. at ___, 112 S.Ct. at 1370.\nSignificantly, as has been repeatedly recognized in the case law, Suter neither overruled Wilder nor replaced the \nWilder/Golden State framework with a different one. See, e.g., Stowell v. Ives, 976 F.2d 65, 68 (1st Cir.1992). Yet\nin arguing that the only right enforceable by plaintiffs under § 1983 is to a state plan approved by the Secretary,\n[24]\ndefendants suggest an application of Suter which is at odds with the holding of Wilder.  Admittedly, when read\nalone, Suter can be interpreted as holding that when a statute requires submission of a state plan in order to\nobtain federal funds, a plaintiff has no cause of action under § 1983 beyond an action to require the submission\nof a conforming plan. See Suter, ___ U.S. at ___, 112 S.Ct. at 1367 (noting that \"the Act does place a\nrequirement on the States, but that requirement only goes so far as to ensure that the State have a plan\"); see\nalso Evelyn V., 819 F.Supp. at 193 n. 8 (referring to proposed legislation to reverse Suter to the extent it holds\nthat the only enforceable requirement of a federal funding statute is for a state to adopt an approved plan). But\nsuch an interpretation would directly conflict with the holding in Wilder and with Wilder's express rejection of the\nview that in the context of the Medicaid statute \"the only right enforceable under section 1983 is the right to\ncompel compliance with [] bare procedural requirements\" such as the adoption of an approved plan. Wilder, 496\n[25]\nU.S. at 513, 110 S.Ct. at 2519.  Until further guidance is forthcoming, Suter and Wilder must be reconciled on\n\n1133 some other basis than that Suter silently overrules Wilder.[26]See, e.g.,*1133Arkansas Medical Soc'y, Inc. v.\nReynolds, 6 F.3d 519, 525 (8th Cir.1993); Stowell, 976 F.2d at 68, 71; Travelers Health Network of Louisiana v.\nOrleans Parish Sch. Bd., 842 F.Supp. 236, 240 (E.D.La.1994); Evelyn V., 819 F.Supp. at 194.\nWhen Suter and Wilder are read together, an amalgamated approach can be stated which is consistent with\neither decision. First, because they have not been repudiated, Golden State and Wilder still provide the basic\nframework in deciding whether an enforceable federal right exists under § 1983. Thus, the provision sought to be\nenforced must be \"intended to benefit the putative plaintiff,\" must be mandatory rather than hortatory, and must\nnot be so vague as to be \"beyond the competence of the judiciary to enforce.\" Wilder, 496 U.S. at 509, 110 S.Ct.\nat 2517. This test should now be applied in light of Suter's directive to focus on \"exactly what is required of\nStates\" by the statute or statutory section sought to be enforced. See Evelyn V., 819 F.Supp. at 194. Moreover, in\ndetermining the precision and assertiveness of the statutory language, Suter suggests that it is appropriate to\nconsider: (1) the language in the context of \"the entire legislative enactment,\" Suter, ___ U.S. at ___, 112 S.Ct. at\n1367; (2) the existence of regulations which provide guidance to the states concerning the method or manner of\ncompliance, id. at ___, 112 S.Ct. at 1368; (3) whether the statutory directive is one \"whose meaning will\nobviously vary with the circumstances of each individual case,\" id.; (4) the availability of other mechanisms to\nenforce the statute, id.; and (5) the applicable legislative history, id. at ___, 112 S.Ct. at 1369.\nEach of the six provisions of the Medicaid Act plaintiffs seek to enforce must be individually examined in light of\nthe above approach to determine if a cause of action exists under § 1983.\nIII. Violations of the Medicaid Act and Regulations\nA. In Effect Statewide\nPlaintiffs claim that the State's scheme for providing Medi-Cal methadone maintenance treatment violates the\nrequirement for statewide applicability of Medicaid plans set forth in 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(1): \"A State plan for\nmedical assistance must ... provide that it shall be in effect in all political subdivisions of the State, and if\nadministered by them, be mandatory upon them.\"\n1. Jurisdiction. Section 1396a(a)(1) creates a federal right enforceable by plaintiffs under § 1983. To begin with,\nthe section is intended to benefit plaintiffs. While it makes no direct reference to Medicaid recipients, recipients of\nmedical services are the obvious beneficiaries of a requirement that a medical assistance plan be in effect\nstatewide. Further, that recipients are the intended beneficiaries is evident in the regulation implementing the\n1134 section, found at 42 C.F.R. § 431.50.[27] Because the regulation *1134 addresses \"equitable standards of\nassistance\" and \"furnish[ing of] service,\" its purpose is to ensure that Medi-Cal patients receive statewide access\n[28]\nto services. See Part III.A.2 infra.\nMoreover, the section's command to the states is mandatory, specific, and detailed. The statute requires that a\nstate plan \"must provide\" for statewide application. The Suter Court found that nearly identical statutory language\nin the Adoption Act imposed mandatory standards on the states. Suter, ___ U.S. at ___, 112 S.Ct. at 1367. The\n[29]\nCourt interpreted the language to require that \"the plan apply to all political subdivisions of the State.\" Id. at\n___, 112 S.Ct. at 1368. Further, the regulations define how service is to be furnished in order to achieve\nstatewide operation and outline specific requirements, such as a system of local offices, procedures for equitable\nand uniform administration of policies, and systematic state evaluations. 42 C.F.R. §§ 431.50(b) & 431.50(c).\nGiven this level of guidance, the statewide requirement is within the competence of the judiciary to enforce.\nFinally, while the Medicaid Act gives the Secretary the authority to withhold federal funds from states failing to\ncomply with 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a), this alternative method of enforcement does not bar a § 1983 action. See \nWilder, 496 U.S. at 512, 110 S.Ct. at 2519 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 1396c; 42 C.F.R. § 430.35). This is true not only for\nthe statewide requirement, but for all the plan provisions plaintiffs seek to enforce. In this respect, the Medicaid\nAct is distinguishable from the statute at issue in Suter. The Adoption Act not only called for loss of federal funds\nupon submission of a non-compliant plan, but also required an independent judicial determination before the\n\nstates could be reimbursed for services associated with removing a child from his or her home. Suter, ___ U.S. at\n[30]\n___, 112 S.Ct. at 1368. A similar additional enforcement mechanism is not available here.  Accordingly,\nplaintiffs may bring suit under § 1983 to enforce the statewide requirement.\n2. Merits. The parties contest the substance of the statewide requirement. Plaintiffs claim that the section entitles\nthem to statewide access to Medi-Cal funded methadone maintenance services. Defendants argue, citing\nregulations at 42 C.F.R. § 431.50(b), that § 1396a(a)(1) only requires states to provide statewide access to\noffices for eligibility determinations and other administrative processes. Defs.' Opp'n to first Summ.J.Mot. at 8.\nDefendants' argument, however, is misplaced in light of subsection (c) of the regulations. That subsection, by\nclarifying that not every individual provider must furnish services statewide, indicates that the furnishing of\n1135 services is indeed encompassed within the requirement of \"statewide *1135 operation\" of the plan. See Clark v.\nKizer, 758 F.Supp. 572, 580 (E.D.Cal.1990) (the \"plain meaning of `be in effect' would appear to be that the\n[Medi-Cal dental care] program shall be in existence, operational and functioning\"), aff'd in part and vacated in\npart on other grounds sub nom., Clark v. Coye, 967 F.2d 585 (9th Cir.1992) (table); Morgan v. Cohen, 665\nF.Supp. 1164, 1178 (E.D.Pa.1987) (the plan must \"operate uniformly across the state\"); Christy v. Ibarra, 826\nP.2d 361, 364 (Colo.1991) (statewide requirement is violated where \"services are available in some counties and\nnot available in the neighboring counties\").\nDefendants further argue that the requirement for statewide operation, even if applicable to services, would only\n[31]\nbe violated if the State plan promised methadone maintenance for all who want or need it.  Defs.' Opp'n to first\nSumm.J.Mot. at 9 (relying on King v. Sullivan, 776 F.Supp. 645, 652 (D.R.I.1991) (\"The State Plan must promise\n[the services sought] to Plaintiffs before the State's failure to provide such services can constitute a violation of\nfederal law.\")). Defendants claim that California's plan promises only to provide those drug abuse treatment\nservices selected by the counties as appropriate for the community; because residents in every county have\naccess to some services 00 if not methadone maintenance, then methadone detoxification or drug free treatment\n97\n00 defendants argue that the plan applies statewide. This argument fails for a number of reasons.\n97\nFirst, defendants' reliance on King is misplaced. King does not involve the failure to provide any access to\nservices in some parts of the State, but instead involves the State's failure to provide the particular amount and\ntype of service desired by plaintiffs. In King, the plaintiffs did not allege a violation of § 1396a(a)(1). Second,\ndefendants' interpretation goes a long way toward nullifying the statutory language. There is no practical\ndifference between a plan which does not apply statewide and a plan which theoretically applies statewide but\npermits political subdivisions to decline to provide otherwise covered medical services. To permit states to offer\ndifferent services in different political subdivisions, as long as the plan itself is procedurally applicable to every\ncounty, would result in a plan that is neither \"in effect\" nor operating on a statewide basis, if those terms have any\nmeaning or purpose. See Wilder, 496 U.S. at 513, 110 S.Ct. at 2517 (the right to enforce a plan requirement is\nnot \"merely a procedural one\"); see also Christy, 826 P.2d at 363-64. Third, defendants' contention that a plan\nwhich does not require all political subdivisions to participate still may be deemed to apply statewide, so long as\n1136 those counties which provide no services *1136 do so according to the plan, is directly contradicted by the\nregulations. See 42 C.F.R. § 431.50(b)(1) (\"The plan will be in operation statewide ... under equitable standards\nfor assistance ... that are mandatory throughout the State.\").\nFinally, methadone maintenance is not distinguishable from other medical services once the State decides to\ntreat it as a covered medical service under Medi-Cal. At oral argument, counsel for defendants suggested that\nmethadone maintenance is analytically distinct from other medical treatment on the basis that drug treatment\nservices contain a \"large social component.\" There may be some force to this argument as a matter of social\npolicy. But there is no basis in the language of the Medicaid Act from which to derive an exception of drug\ntreatment services from the statewide requirement. As a covered service, methadone maintenance is subject to\nthe same requirements as any other medical service. Weaver v. Reagen, 886 F.2d 194, 197 (8th Cir.1989). Just\nas a Medicaid plan which provided residents of some counties access to heart by-pass operations to treat heart\ndisease but residents of other counties access only to nutrition counseling and medication would violate § 1396a\n(a)(1), so does a plan that provides some residents methadone treatment and others, for example, only \"day care\nhabilitative treatment.\" In short, a state scheme which denies access to a Medi-Cal covered medical treatment or\nservice based on the recipient's county of residence violates the requirement that the plan be in effect statewide.\n\nThe remaining question is whether plaintiffs' proof is sufficient to support the requested relief. As evidence that\nthe plan is not in effect statewide, plaintiffs offer, first, the undisputed fact that only 18 counties have elected to\nreceive Medi-Cal funding for methadone maintenance. The Chief Deputy Director of the Department of Alcohol\nand Drug Programs states that she believes there may be unmet need in the counties not providing Medi-Cal\nfunded treatment. Dep. of Elizabeth Stanley, 31:14-22. Second, plaintiffs offer the testimony of two Santa Barbara\nCounty residents who are on public assistance but who must privately pay for methadone maintenance because\nthat County does not offer Medi-Cal funded treatment. McCloud Decl., ¶ 3; Sanchez Decl., ¶ 3. Finally, the\ndirector of the Marin County clinic, which does receive Medi-Cal funds, states that he currently treats a Medi-Cal\neligible patient from Lake County who must drive 180 miles each day to obtain treatment. He is unable to place\nher in a Medi-Cal funded slot because his contract with the County requires him to offer these slots to Marin\nresidents only. Further, at his clinic, approximately 20 Medi-Cal patients are currently paying partial fees for\nservice. Slattery Decl., ¶¶ 7, 8 & 9.\nIn response, defendants offer evidence which indicates that Drug/Medi-Cal providers in several counties are in\nfact serving some out-of-county residents. Defs.' Ex. 5, at 3. In addition, most of the 40 counties without Medi-Cal\nmethadone maintenance lack a certified provider, so that treatment is unavailable in those counties even to\n[32]\nprivate-pay patients.  Jarfors Decl., ¶ 7. This evidence creates a factual dispute regarding whether Medi-Cal\nrecipients in non-participating counties, as a class, are able to obtain services in other counties within a\nreasonable distance and a reasonable time.\nPlaintiffs have made a substantial evidentiary showing that the State scheme limits Medi-Cal coverage based on\ncounty of residence, and thereby have established a likelihood of success on the claim that access to services is\nunavailable statewide. Some questions remain, however, about the extent of the problem. The record does not\n1137 reveal whether substantial numbers of the Medi-Cal eligible are unable to obtain service under *1137 the current\nsystem, or instead whether only a handful of patients have slipped through the cracks. The lack of such evidence\nleaves the record insufficiently developed to grant summary judgment as to plaintiffs' claim. See Irvin v. Griffin\nCorp., 808 F.2d 802, 807 (11th Cir.1987) (district court has wide discretion to deny a summary judgment motion).\nHowever, the current record is sufficiently developed for the court to grant a preliminary injunction on the basis\n[33]\nthat the State plan is not \"in effect\" statewide.  Plaintiffs' declarations establish that the current system for\nproviding methadone maintenance creates a serious and immediate threat to the health and well-being of some\nrecipients. See, e.g., Quilling Decl.; Randall Decl.; Randolph Decl. Although the State has a legitimate interest in\nthe continuity of its program, the administrative disruption required to provide interim relief to plaintiffs need not\nbe any more substantial than that which occurred when the State intervened in Alameda County. See note 7, \nsupra. While assuring that the State or all counties cover methadone maintenance services on a statewide basis\nwill undoubtedly take some effort to implement, the plaintiffs are faced with serious and irreparable hardship,\nincluding serious health problems. On balance, the hardship suffered by plaintiffs outweighs the State's interest in\nthe continuity of its existing local option treatment system. Cf. Withrow v. Concannon, 942 F.2d 1385, 1387-88\n(9th Cir.1991); Bracco v. Lackner, 462 F.Supp. 436, 452 (N.D.Cal.1978); Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 266, 90\nS.Ct. 1011, 1019, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970). Accordingly, plaintiffs are entitled to a preliminary injunction requiring\nthat Medi-Cal funded methadone maintenance services must be made available to all residents of the State\nwithout regard to county of residence.\nB. Equal Access\nUnder 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30), commonly called the \"equal access\" provision, a state Medi-Cal plan must\nprovide such methods and procedures relating to the utilization of, and the payment for, care and\nservices available under the plan ... as may be necessary to ... assure that payments are\nconsistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care and are sufficient to enlist enough\nproviders so that care and services are available under the plan at least to the extent that such\ncare and services are available to the general population in the geographic area.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30). The corresponding regulation provides that \"the agency's payments must be sufficient\nto enlist enough providers so that services under the plan are available to recipients at least to the extent that\nthose services are available to the general population.\" 42 C.F.R. § 447.204.\n1. Jurisdiction. In its recent opinion in Arkansas Medical Soc'y, Inc. v. Reynolds, 6 F.3d 519 (8th Cir.1993), the\nEighth Circuit held that the equal access provision may be enforced by Medicaid providers and recipients in a §\n1983 action. After applying the relevant factors from Suter and Wilder, the court determined that the provision is\n\"indisputably intended to benefit [] recipients\" as well as providers. Id. at 526. Further, the statutory language,\nviewed in light of the entire legislative enactment and the legislative history, is expressed in mandatory rather\n[34]\nthan precatory terms. Id. Although some terms in the statute are ambiguous, applicable regulations  and the\nlegislative history supply sufficient guidance to the states concerning compliance, and also supply the judicially\nmanageable standards needed to evaluate that compliance. Id. at 527. The court concluded that the equal\n1138 access provision unambiguously confers a *1138 right within the meaning of Suter. Id. at 527-28. The analysis in \nArkansas Medical Soc'y is persuasive, and thus the plaintiffs have a § 1983 cause of action to enforce § 1396a\n(a)(30).\n2. Merits. Plaintiffs claim that the State is violating the equal access provision in two ways. First, defendants'\n\"method of paying\" for methadone maintenance allows a county to eliminate the service from its array of drug\ntreatment programs. As a result, the State's payments are zero in the counties which choose to forego Medi-Cal\nfunding even though private-pay methadone maintenance services are available in some of these counties.\nSecond, the State's \"administration\" of Medi-Cal methadone maintenance results in \"gross disparities\" between\nservices available to private-pay patients and services available to the Medi-Cal eligible in counties which do opt\nto provide the service. Pls.' Supp. in first Summ.J.Mot. at 28. This disparity results from funding constraints which\ntranslate to a limited number of Medi-Cal treatment slots.\nPlaintiffs seek to give the equal access provision too broad a scope. The conduct of which they complain 00 the\n97\ndenial of all services in some counties and the limitation on slots in others 00 may violate other provisions of the\n97\nMedicaid Act, but it is not prohibited by a provision that concerns only the rate of reimbursement.\nThe statute and its corresponding regulation prohibit \"payments\" which result in disparities in service. It is evident\nfrom this language and the legislative history that the equal access provision is directed at prohibiting the\npayment of insufficient reimbursement rates to providers. In 1989, Congress codified the equal access statute,\nwhich previously had been contained only in a regulation. The House Report indicates that in this section\nCongress was concerned only with the rates paid for services supplied by existing providers:\nUnder current law, states have discretion in establishing payment rates ... for physician services\nunder their Medicaid programs.... A physician's decision to accept Medicaid patients is affected by\nmany factors ... [including] the payment rate itself.... As [stated in testimony before Congress],\n`There is no doubt that Medicaid reimbursement rates have not kept pace with average\ncommunity rates.' ... States have restrained physician fees [to control] program costs.... [T]he\nCommittee believes that, without adequate payment levels, it is simply unrealistic to expect\nphysicians to participate in the program....\nThe Committee bill would codify ... the current regulation, 42 C.F.R. § 447.204, requiring adequate\npayment levels.... [T]he Medicaid payments would have to be at a level that ensures that Medicaid\nbeneficiaries in that area have at least the same access to physicians as the rest of the insured\npopulation in that area. The Committee bill would not require that Medicaid payment levels be high\nenough to induce physicians to relocate into this area.\nH.R.Rep. 247, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. (1989), reprinted in 1989 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1906, 2060, 2115-16 (emphasis\nadded).\nPlaintiffs do not cite, and the court has not found, any authority holding the equal access provision applicable to\ndisputes challenging the distribution of services independently of the reimbursement rate paid. Cf. Arkansas\nMedical Soc'y, 6 F.3d at 519 (challenge to 20 percent across the board cut in reimbursement rates); Clark v.\n\nKizer, 758 F.Supp. 572, 578 (E.D.Cal.1990) (noting that \"the statute directs the State's attention to reimbursement\nlevels\"; reimbursing dentists at 40 percent of their usual rates violates the equal access requirement), aff'd in part\nand vacated in part on other grounds sub nom., Clark v. Coye, 967 F.2d 585 (9th Cir.1992) (table); King v.\nSullivan, 776 F.Supp. 645, 654-55 (D.R.I.1991) (equal access challenge rejected when the gist of plaintiffs'\ncomplaint was a shortage of a particular type of Medicaid service).\nThe equal access provision is directed at a particular problem 00 inadequate reimbursement rates 00 and the court\n97 97\ndeclines to expand it to encompass plaintiffs' claims regarding the inadequate amount and distribution of services\n1139 available. The provision and distribution of services is specifically addressed in *1139 other sections of the\nMedicaid Act, including §§ 1396a(a)(1), 1396a(a)(8), and 1396a(a)(10)(B), and these sections must govern the\nresolution of plaintiffs' claim. Because Medi-Cal reimbursement rates for methadone maintenance treatment\n[35]\ncompare favorably to the rates paid by private-pay patients, see Decl. of Allan F. Harlow, ¶ 7,  plaintiffs have\nfailed to raise serious questions going to the merits of their claim that the State has violated the equal access\nprovision. Summary judgment is not appropriate for plaintiffs for the same reason.\nC. Comparability for Categorically Needy Individuals\n42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(B) creates an equality principle by which all categorically needy individuals must\nreceive medical assistance which is no less than that provided to any other categorically or medically needy\n[36]\nindividual.\n1. Jurisdiction. Section 1396a(a)(10)(B) creates a federal right that can be enforced under § 1983 by those\nplaintiffs who are categorically needy within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(A). First, the comparability\nrequirements contained in § 1396a(a)(10)(B) are intended to benefit the categorically needy plaintiffs in this case.\nThe statute addresses the benefits to be received by \"any [categorically needy] individual\" in relation to benefits\nreceived by other categorically needy individuals or by medically needy individuals. 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(B)\n(emphasis added). Similarly, the implementing regulation refers to \"services available to any individual\" or \"any\n[37]\ncategorically needy recipient.\" 42 C.F.R. § 440.240 (emphasis added).  Thus, the language of § 1396a(a)(10)\n(B) and 42 C.F.R. § 440.240 indicates that the Act's comparability provision is designed to benefit individuals who\nare categorically needy, such as plaintiffs.\nSecond, like the other sections of the Act at issue in this case, § 1396a(a)(10)(B) is phrased in mandatory, not\nprecatory, terms. The statute provides that a state plan for medical assistance \"must ... provide ... that the\nmedical assistance made to any [categorically needy] individual ... shall not be less in amount, duration, or scope\nthan the medical assistance made available\" to any other categorically needy individual or to medically needy\nindividuals. 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(B) (emphasis added).\nThird, the statute is sufficiently precise to be within the competence of the judiciary to enforce. Section 1396a(a)\n(10)(B) requires the states to provide all individuals who are categorically needy with medical assistance at least\nas extensive, in terms of \"amount, duration, or scope,\" as that provided to the medically needy or to any other\ncategorically needy person. These directions provide courts with an objective \"benchmark,\" see Wilder, 496 U.S.\nat 519, 110 S.Ct. at 2523, against which to measure a state's performance. Because the statutory and regulatory\nscheme \"presents a straightforward, identifiable standard ... readily susceptible of judicial evaluation,\" Albiston v.\nMaine Comm'r of Human Serv., 7 F.3d 258, 267 (1st Cir.1993), the court has jurisdiction over a claim brought\nunder § 1983 to enforce § 1396a(a)(10)(B).\n1140 *1140 2. Merits. The plain language of § 1396a(a)(10)(B) requires that a state plan for medical assistance must\nprovide that each categorically needy individual receive medical assistance not less in amount, duration, and\nscope than that received by other categorically needy persons or by medically needy persons in the state. It is\nundisputed that the Drug/Medi-Cal program fails to fund enough methadone maintenance slots for all of the\ncategorically needy who are eligible for the service. By denying the same service to the categorically needy\nmembers of the plaintiff class that is received by other categorically needy persons and by some medically needy\n[38]\npersons, the State violates § 1396a(a)(10)(B). Plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment on this claim.\n\nDefendants make two principal arguments in an attempt to avoid this conclusion. First, they claim that § 1396a(a)\n(10)(B) is designed to ensure comparability between the various groups that comprise the categorically needy,\n[39]\nnot to ensure comparability within each such group.  Second, defendants argue that even if the Medicaid Act\nrequires comparability within the different groups of the categorically needy, comparability only extends to the\n\"amount, duration, and scope\" of medical assistance, which is not implicated when providers are forced by State\nbudgetary shortfalls to place some, but not all, categorically needy persons on waiting lists for Medi-Cal funded\ntreatment slots. Neither of these arguments is persuasive.\na. Comparability Within Groups of the Categorically Needy.\nDefendants claim that § 1396a(a)(10)(B) seeks to ensure comparable services for the distinct groups that make\nup the categorically needy, not parity for individuals within those distinct groups. Defendants cite Schweiker v.\nHogan, 457 U.S. 569, 573 n. 6, 102 S.Ct. 2597, 2601 n. 6, 73 L.Ed.2d 227 (1982), which notes that the legislative\nhistory of the section refers to the need to \"eliminate some of the unevenness which has been apparent in the\ntreatment of the medical needs of various groups of the needy.\" Id. (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 213, 89th Cong., 1st\nSess. 66 (1965)) (emphasis added). Defendants also rely on the initial language of § 1396a(a)(10)(B), prior to its\n[40]\namendment in 1973, which seemingly required comparability between groups of the categorically needy.\n1141 The present language of the statute, however, expressly requires that any categorically *1141 needy individual\nreceive medical assistance not less in amount, duration, and scope than that received by \"any other such\nindividual.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(B)(i). Given \"the basic and unexceptional rule that courts must give effect to\nthe clear meaning of statutes as written,\" Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., ___ U.S. ___, ___, 112 S.Ct.\n[41]\n2589, 2594, 120 L.Ed.2d 379 (1992), defendants' argument must be rejected.  All relevant reported cases and\nscholarly authority examining § 1396a(a)(10)(B) support this conclusion. See, e.g., White v. Beal, 555 F.2d 1146,\n1149 (3d Cir.1977) (\"[A]ll persons within a given category must be treated equally.\"); Becker v. Toia, 439 F.Supp.\n324, 333 (S.D.N.Y.1977) (noting that under the comparability provisions of the Act, each categorically needy\nperson \"shall be eligible for the same `amount, duration and scope' of coverage as all the others in his or her\ngroup\"); Roe v. Casey, 464 F.Supp. 487, 494 (E.D.Pa. 1978) (\"[T]he medical assistance made available to either\na categorically needy or medically needy person shall not be less in amount, duration or scope than the medical\nassistance made available to any other person in that particular category.\"), aff'd,623 F.2d 829 (3d Cir.1980);\nSchultz & Parmenter, Medical Necessity, AIDS, and the Law, 9 St. Louis U.Pub.L.Rev. 379 (1990) (\"The equitable\ndistribution requirement mandates that the medical assistance provided to any individual within a given group of\n... categorically needy `shall not be less in amount, duration, or scope than the medical assistance made\navailable to any other such individual....\") (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(B)).\nMississippi v. Sullivan, 951 F.2d 80 (5th Cir.1992), is not to the contrary. In Sullivan, the court interpreted 42\n[42]\nU.S.C. § 1396a(a)(17)  to require comparability between and not within groups of the categorically needy with\nrespect to the standards used to determine eligibility for medical assistance. However, § 1396a(a)(17) explicitly\nrequires that standards be \"comparable for all groups [of the categorically needy],\" while § 1396a(a)(10)(B) refers\nto comparable treatment for categorically needy \"individuals.\" Congress' use of different language in §§ 1396a(a)\n(10)(B) and 1396a(a)(17) suggests that Congress intended a different standard in the two sections, and provided\nfor comparability between groups in § 1396a(a)(17) but within groups in § 1396a(a)(10)(B). See Russello v.\nUnited States, 464 U.S. 16, 23, 104 S.Ct. 296, 300, 78 L.Ed.2d 17 (1983) (\"[W]here Congress includes particular\nlanguage in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that\nCongress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\") (quoting United States v.\n[43]\nWong Kim Bo, 472 F.2d 720, 722 (5th Cir. 1972) (alteration in original)).\nb. Medical Assistance Less in Amount, Duration, or Scope.\n1142 Defendants argue that placement of plaintiffs on waiting lists is not the same as *1142 providing them with\nmedical assistance that is less in \"amount, duration, or scope\" than that received by others through Medi-Cal.\n\nThey claim that waiting lists have nothing to do with amount, duration, or scope of medical assistance: Since all\neligible recipients eventually will receive the same services and reimbursement for such services, § 1396a(a)(10)\n(B) is satisfied.\n[44]\nThe State's argument brings to mind Lord Keynes' rejoinder that \"in the long run we are all dead.\"  In the long\nrun all categorically needy persons may receive services. But in the meantime they do not, and life does not stop\nfor them during this interim period. For anyone in immediate need of medical treatment, the value of medical\nservices provided in the future is less than the value of medical services provided when needed, particularly\n[45]\nwhen the need is great. See Greenstein v. Bane, 833 F.Supp. 1054, 1074 (S.D.N.Y.1993) (plaintiffs \"forced to\npay for treatment or services which are furnished to ordinary Medicaid recipients without charge ... have not\nreceived assistance equal in amount to the assistance received by these other recipients who pay nothing. As\ncompared with other Medicaid recipients, plaintiffs' medical assistance has diminished in value\"); cf. Clark v.\nKizer, 758 F.Supp. 572, 580 (E.D.Cal.1990) (granting summary judgment to plaintiffs, in part, on ground that\nvarying availability of Denti-Cal (the dental component of California's Medicaid program) violated the\ncomparability requirement of the Medicaid Act), aff'd in part and vacated in part on other grounds sub nom., Clark\nv. Coye, 967 F.2d 585 (9th Cir.1992) (table); Hodecker v. Blum, 525 F.Supp. 867, 873 (N.D.N.Y.1981) (holding\nthat State's Medicaid budgetary process, which required the relatives of adult Medicaid recipients to contribute\nmore than the relatives of minor Medicaid recipients to a patient's care, violated the comparability rule for\ncategorically needy persons), aff'd,685 F.2d 424 (2d Cir. 1982). Thus, the delay of medical services to some of\nthe categorically needy violates the \"amount, duration, or scope\" requirement of the comparability provision.\nA holding that the State violates § 1396a(a)(10)(B) by funding Medi-Cal in such a way as to create waiting lists is\n[46]\nnot inconsistent with other provisions in the Act  and with cases such as Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287,\n105 S.Ct. 712, 83 L.Ed.2d 661 (1985), which emphasize that states have substantial discretion to choose the\nproper amount, scope, and duration limitations on coverage. Despite the comparability requirement, the State\nretains substantial discretion in determining eligibility standards and in choosing the overall mix of optional\n[47]\nbenefits to include in its plan.\nPlaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment on their claim brought under § 1396a(a)(10)(B).\nD. Service Sufficient in Amount, Duration, and Scope\nPlaintiffs seek relief on their claim that the State, by denying methadone maintenance treatment to some who are\nMedi-Cal eligible, for reasons other than medical necessity, has violated the regulation found at 42 C.F.R. §\n440.230(b): \"Each service must be sufficient in amount, duration and scope to reasonably achieve its purpose.\"\nPlaintiffs claim, and it appears from a review of the statutes listed in 42 C.F.R. § 440.200 as the source of the\n1143 regulation, that § 440.230(b) *1143 implements § 1396a(a)(10)(B).[48] Yet the regulation 00 directed to the\n97\nsufficiency of each medical service to achieve the purpose of the service 00 has little relation to the comparability\n97\nrequirement contained in the statute.\nWhether a regulation, independent of an underlying statute, is enforceable under § 1983 is a matter of some\nuncertainty. Plaintiffs rely on Wright v. City of Roanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority, 479 U.S. 418, 107\nS.Ct. 766, 93 L.Ed.2d 781 (1987), for the proposition that \"a federal regulation can create an enforceable right\nunder section 1983.\" Pls.' Supp. in first Summ.J.Mot. at 22 n. 14. Indeed, some circuits have adopted such an\ninterpretation of the holding in Wright. See West Virginia Univ. Hosp., Inc. v. Casey, 885 F.2d 11, 18 (3d Cir.1989)\n(\"[V]alid federal regulations as well as federal statutes may create rights enforceable under section 1983.\"), aff'd\non other grounds,499 U.S. 83, 111 S.Ct. 1138, 113 L.Ed.2d 68 (1991); Samuels v. District of Columbia, 770 F.2d\n184, 199 (D.C.Cir.1985) (\"[S]ection 1983 provides a legal remedy for the violation of all valid federal laws,\nincluding at least those federal regulations adopted pursuant to a clear congressional mandate that have the full\nforce and effect of law.\"); see also Ermler v. Town of Brookhaven, 780 F.Supp. 120, 122 (E.D.N.Y.1992). But \nWright is susceptible to a more limited interpretation. In holding that public housing tenants could enforce the\nBrooke Amendment to the Housing Act and its implementing regulations under § 1983, the majority opinion\nexamined the statute and regulation together to determine whether they conferred specific, definable rights on\n\nplaintiffs. See Wright, 479 U.S. at 429-33, 107 S.Ct. at 773-76. The regulation at issue in Wright defined a term\nused in the statute itself; unlike the regulation here, it neither stood alone nor was analyzed independently of its\n[49]\nstatutory mooring. Id. at 420, 107 S.Ct. at 768-69.  Only the dissent raised the question \"whether\nadministrative regulations alone could create [an enforceable] right.\" Id. at 437, 107 S.Ct. at 777 (O'Connor, J.,\ndissenting); see also id. (\"This is a troubling issue not briefed by the parties, and I do not attempt to resolve it\nhere.\"). In the Ninth Circuit, whether a regulation standing alone may create enforceable rights is apparently an\nopen question. See Howard v. City of Burlingame, 937 F.2d 1376, 1380 (9th Cir. 1991) (noting that \"federal\nregulations ... may define legal obligations enforceable under section 1983\"; \"[t]here is some question, however,\nwhether they may create rights not already implied by the enabling statute\"). Although plaintiffs cite several cases\nwhere courts have decided the merits of § 440.230(b) claims standing alone, not one of these cases addresses\nthe jurisdictional issue. See, e.g., Weaver v. Reagen, 886 F.2d 194, 198 (8th Cir.1989); White v. Beal, 555 F.2d\n1146, 1151 (3d Cir.1977); King v. Sullivan, 776 F.Supp. 645, 653 (D.R.I.1991); Linton v. Carney, 779 F.Supp. 925,\n936 (E.D.Tenn. 1990); Ledet v. Fischer, 638 F.Supp. 1288, 1293 (M.D.La.1986); Allen v. Mansour, 681 F.Supp.\n1232, 1237 (E.D.Mich.1986).\nEven assuming the \"amount, duration and scope\" regulation may be enforced independently of any statutory\nsection that generally confers the same right, it is unclear that the regulation is framed with the requisite\nspecificity to create an enforceable right under Suter. The regulation provides that each Medicaid service must be\n\"sufficient ... to reasonably achieve its purpose.\" What is considered reasonable, however, is not defined. The\nprecise definition would seem to \"vary with the circumstances of each individual case,\" a characteristic which,\nunder Suter, is not associated with an enforceable right under § 1983. Suter, ___ U.S. at ___, 112 S.Ct. at 1368.\n1144 Although Wilder and *1144Suter look to guidance from statutory language, regulations, and legislative history to\nprovide the necessary specificity, plaintiffs here offer only judicial interpretations to clarify the section.\nIn King, the court provides one interpretation:\nWhen a state commits itself to providing Medicaid services, 42 C.F.R. § 440.230(b) simply\nobligates the state to provide them adequately, so that the state does not nominally recognize its\nobligations while failing to meet them financially. And the state need not meet its obligations\nperfectly. A service is sufficient in amount, duration and scope if it adequately meets the needs of\nmost individuals eligible for Medicaid....\n776 F.Supp. at 652 (citing Charleston Memorial Hosp. v. Conrad, 693 F.2d 324, 330 (4th Cir.1982)). Accord Curtis\nv. Taylor, 625 F.2d 645, 653 (5th Cir.1980); see also Virginia Hosp. Ass'n v. Kenley, 427 F.Supp. 781, 786\n(E.D.Va.1977) (construing an apparently earlier version of the regulation). In another line of cases, however, the\ncourts have taken a different approach, holding a decision to deny services arbitrary and unreasonable under §\n440.230(b) when it is made for reasons other than medical necessity. See Weaver, 886 F.2d at 198; White, 555\nF.2d at 1151; Allen, 681 F.Supp. at 1237; Ledet, 638 F.Supp. at 1293. Other than these possibly inconsistent\njudicial interpretations, plaintiffs have directed the court to no other source for assistance in interpreting the\norigins or purpose of the vague language in the regulation. While more thorough briefing may shed additional\nlight on this question, the court declines to determine whether the regulation creates enforceable rights in\nplaintiffs on the current state of the briefing. Further, even if the \"amount, duration and scope\" regulation is\nenforceable by private actions under § 1983, the scope of the states' obligation under the regulation is unclear in\nlight of the conflicting case law.\nE. Single State Agency\nA state's Medicaid plan must \"provide for the establishment or designation of a single State agency to administer\n[50]\nor supervise the administration of the plan.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(5).  Implementing regulations provide, in\npertinent part, that to qualify as a Medicaid agency\n(1) the agency must not delegate, to other than its own officials, authority to 00\n97\n(i) Exercise administrative discretion in the administration or supervision of the plan, or\n\n(ii) Issue policies, rules, and regulations on program matters.\n. . . . .\n(3) If other State or local agencies or offices perform services for the Medicaid agency, they must\nnot have the authority to change or disapprove any administrative decision of that agency, or\notherwise substitute their judgment for that of the Medicaid agency with respect to the application\nof policies, rules, and regulations issued by the Medicaid agency.\n42 C.F.R. § 431.10(e). Read with the regulation, the requirement of a single state agency is both mandatory in its\nterms and specific and detailed in its command to the states. Much more doubtful, however, is whether Medicaid\n[51]\nrecipients and providers are the intended beneficiaries of the single state agency requirement.  The court\nconcludes that they are not and thus that the section does not confer upon plaintiffs a right enforceable through §\n1983.\nThe single state agency clause is not phrased in terms of benefitting plaintiffs or providing services to plaintiffs. \nCompare Wilder, 496 U.S. at 510, 110 S.Ct. at 2517-18 (there can be \"little doubt\" that the Boren Amendment\nwas intended to benefit health care providers since the language is \"phrased in terms benefitting [them]\" by\n1145 requiring payment for health care services). Instead, *1145 it is phrased in terms of plan administration by a\nsingle agency. This focus is made more emphatic in the implementing regulation which forbids delegations of\ndiscretion or rule making authority to other agencies. Both the statute and regulation appear directed to the\nefficient and uniform operation of the Medicaid program, rather than to the provision of a direct or immediate\nbenefit to Medicaid recipients or providers. Of course, any provision of the Medicaid Act may in some general\nsense be viewed as benefitting recipients, since this is the purpose of the statute as a whole. But such a\ngeneralized intent to benefit recipients is not enough under Wilder and Suter to confer a § 1983 cause of action.\nHere neither the statute nor the regulation unambiguously confers a benefit on recipients or providers.\nThis view of the statutory language is supported by the legislative history of the section. The single state agency\nrequirement first appeared in the original Social Security Act of 1935, and was copied, practically verbatim, into\nthe Medicaid Act in 1965. See H.R. 4120, § 204, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. (1935), reprinted in Stevens, supra, at\n100. The 1935 Act was enacted, in part, based on the recommendations and proposals of the President's\nCommittee on Economic Security, established by Executive Order in 1934. Stevens, supra, at 64. Documents\nsubmitted to the Committee reflect a debate regarding whether the social security program would be best\nadministered solely by the federal government or instead under the system ultimately adopted 00 a system of\n97\nfederal-state cooperation, with each state administering its own program under federal requirements. See id. at\n78; see also Guidice v. Jackson, 726 F.Supp. 632, 635 (E.D.Va.1989) (quoting Social Security Board, Social\nSecurity in America, A Summary of Staff Reports of the Committee on Economic Security 161, 191 (1937) (\"The\nCommittee recommended that responsibility for administration of the assistance be centralized within the state to\n`avoid a diversity of operating standards in the subdivisions within the [s]tate[s].'\")), aff'd, 915 F.2d 1564 (4th\nCir.1990) (table). While many complex considerations were involved, Congress' overriding concern was with\ndeveloping a successful and workable national social security program. See Stevens, supra, at 78.\nThe legislative history of the 1965 Medicaid Act's single state agency requirement 00 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(5) 00\n97 97\nmaintains this concentration on administrative efficiency. Congress adopted the language of the Social Security\nAct of 1935 without comment and only debated which state agency was to be charged with the administrative\nresponsibility for the program. The House bill provided that the agency responsible for eligibility determinations\nunder the existing Social Security programs should also administer Medicaid. H.R.Rep. No. 213, 89th Cong., 1st\nSess. (1965), reprinted in 12665-2 House Miscellaneous Reports on Public Bills II at 65. The House's purpose\nwas primarily to ensure that beneficiaries received prompt determinations of eligibility, but the House also\nrecognized the importance of involving welfare agencies in the administration of medical care. Consequently, the\nHouse version required the eligibility agency to cooperate with other agencies \"[i]n order to make certain that\nthere is no duplication of effort and that maximum utilization will be made of the resources available from such\nother agencies.\" Id.\n\nIn the Senate, the bill was changed to allow the states themselves to select the administering agency. S.Rep. No.\n404, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. (1965), reprinted in 1965 U.S.C.C.A.N.1943. This change was precipitated by the\nSenate's conclusion that the program might be better administered by public health agencies. Id. at 2016 (noting\nthat \"witnesses ... have expressed the belief that the State health agency should be given the primary\nresponsibility under this program\"); see also 111 Cong.Rec. 17729 (1965) (statement of Rep. Mills) (\"[M]edical\nprograms have to have the advice of ... those people who are skilled in the field of medical services.... Such a\nprogram cannot be properly administered in my opinion without their advice and assistance.\"), reprinted in 1965\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 2295. Thus, administrative efficiency appears to have been the overriding purpose of the Senate.\n1146 The role for the eligibility agency was preserved, but as secondary rather than primary. That the *1146 Senate\nversion was ultimately enacted, see Conf.Rep. No. 682, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. (1965), reprinted in 1965\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 2228, 2245, suggests that Congress adopted the Senate's emphasis on administration over the\nHouse's concern regarding eligibility determinations. Plaintiffs have cited no contrary legislative history\n[52]\nestablishing Medicaid recipients as the intended beneficiaries of the single state agency requirement.\nFurther, the applicable regulation suggests that the purpose of both the regulation and statute is to further the\nefficient operation of the program and properly allocate authority within the state and between the federal and\nstate governments. See 42 C.F.R. § 431.10. Subdivision (e), quoted above, limits the ability of the designated\nagency to delegate authority. Subdivisions (b) and (c) concern procedures for designation of the single agency\nand the eligibility agency, if different. Subdivision (d) requires a written agreement allocating responsibility\nbetween federal and state agencies. Nothing in the regulations suggests a primary purpose of benefitting\nrecipients. Cf. 42 C.F.R. §§ 431.50(c), 435.930 & 447.204 (regulations implementing other sections of the\nMedicaid Act directly address the level and type of service to which beneficiaries are entitled). At most, Medicaid\nrecipients and providers are incidental beneficiaries of the single state agency requirement, to the extent that it\nresults in an efficiently operating Medicaid program. This benefit is too remote, however, to confer an\nunambiguous federal right on plaintiffs to enforce the statute or regulation through a § 1983 cause of action.\nAccordingly, defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiffs' claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(5) is granted.\nF. Reasonable Promptness\nPlaintiffs allege that the defendants' failure to provide a sufficient number of methadone maintenance treatment\nslots, which forces Medi-Cal eligible persons onto waiting lists, violates 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8), the Medicaid\nAct's \"reasonable promptness\" provision.\n1. Jurisdiction. Under 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8), a state plan for medical assistance \"must ... provide that all\nindividuals wishing to make application for medical assistance under the plan shall have the opportunity to do so,\nand that such assistance shall be furnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible individuals.\" Corresponding\nregulations provide:\nThe agency must 00\n97\n(a) Furnish Medicaid promptly to recipients without any delay caused by the agency's\nadministrative procedures;\n(b) Continue to furnish Medicaid regularly to all eligible individuals until they are found to be\nineligible....\n42 C.F.R. § 435.930.\nBecause § 1396a(a)(8) establishes requirements for providing services and is \"phrased in terms of benefitting\"\nindividuals seeking Medicaid services, Medi-Cal recipients are the intended beneficiaries. See Wilder, 496 U.S. at\n508-10, 110 S.Ct. at 2517. Similarly, the obligation imposed is mandatory because the state plan \"must ...\n1147 provide\" that medical *1147 assistance \"shall be furnished\" in accordance with the section.\nMoreover, the requirement of \"reasonable promptness\" is sufficiently definite to enforce. See Wellington v. District\nof Columbia, 851 F.Supp. 1, 5 (D.D.C.1994). A statute is not necessarily too vague to be within the competence\n\nof the judiciary to enforce merely because it requires an inquiry into \"reasonableness.\" Albiston v. Maine Comm'r\nof Human Serv., 7 F.3d 258, 267 (1st Cir.1993). The \"relevant question is whether the action or purpose whose\n`reasonableness' is commanded has been clearly delineated and is susceptible of judicial ascertainment.\" Id.\nSection 1396a(a)(8) is more analogous to the \"reasonable cost\" provision in Wilder than to the \"reasonable\nefforts\" provision in Suter. What constitutes \"reasonable\" promptness in providing medical assistance is\ninherently more circumscribed and judicially ascertainable than the concept of \"reasonable efforts\" in the\nplacement of foster children, which requires case by case consideration. Cf. id. (\"`[P]romptness of payment'\npresents a straightforward, identifiable standard ... readily susceptible of judicial evaluation.\"). In addition, the\nimplementing regulations provide standards for compliance. Under 42 C.F.R. § 435.930, administrative\n[53]\nprocedures may not delay a state's provision of services.  And 42 C.F.R. § 435.991 prescribes acceptable time\nlimits for particular administrative procedures such as eligibility determinations, thereby establishing definite\n[54]\nstandards for measuring acceptable delay in providing services.  How the state is to comply is not left to the\n[55]\nstate itself as in Suter, but is instead measured by standards that are within judicial competence to enforce.\nSee Wellington, 851 F.Supp. at 5. Accordingly, the reasonable promptness clause confers enforceable rights on\nplaintiffs.\n2. Merits. Defendants assert that the reasonable promptness requirement applies only to the application and\neligibility process and has no bearing whatsoever on the provision of care and services, not even on\nadministrative delay in the provision of service. However, § 1396a(a)(8) requires \"medical assistance under the\nplan\" to be furnished with reasonable promptness, and this can only mean medical services. See 42 U.S.C. §\n1396d(a). Similarly, the regulation refers to \"furnish[ing] Medicaid,\" not merely processing applications.\nDefendants' interpretation is also contradicted by the case law. See McMillan v. McCrimon, 807 F.Supp. 475, 480\n(C.D.Ill.1992) (scope of § 1396a(a)(8) is not limited to the initial provision of a Medicaid card). Because\ndefendants' argument is incompatible with the plain language of § 1396a(a)(8), their motion to dismiss plaintiffs'\nreasonable promptness claim is denied.\nIn seeking summary judgment on this claim, plaintiffs argue that the reasonable promptness provision is violated:\n1148 (1) because *1148 patients in counties which offer Medi-Cal funded methadone treatment are placed on waiting\nlists for Medi-Cal slots due to limitations on funding; and (2) because patients who are residents of those counties\n[56]\nwhich forego Medi-Cal funding have no access to the service at all, unless they privately pay.  Plaintiffs argue\nthat the reasonable promptness provision is violated not only by undue administrative delays, such as in\nprocessing requests for services, but also by delay caused by insufficient funding. The argument is persuasive\n[57]\nand summary judgment is granted to plaintiffs on their reasonable promptness claim.\nWhen Congress passed the Medicaid Act in 1965, it included several provisions in the Act that were contained in\nalmost identically phrased provisions in existing chapters of the Social Security Act, such as AFDC and Aid to the\nBlind. See S.Rep. No. 404, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. (1965), reprinted in 1965 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1943, 2014-15. One\nsuch provision was the reasonable promptness requirement.\nIn Jefferson v. Hackney, 406 U.S. 535, 92 S.Ct. 1724, 32 L.Ed.2d 285 (1972), the Court noted that the\nreasonable promptness provision in the AFDC program, 42 U.S.C. § 602(a)(10)(A), was\nenacted at a time when persons whom the State had determined to be eligible for the payment of\nbenefits were placed on waiting lists, because of the shortage of state funds. The statute was\nintended to prevent the States from denying benefits, even temporarily, to a person who has been\nfound fully qualified for aid.\nId. at 545, 92 S.Ct. at 1731. The Court's understanding of the purpose of the reasonable promptness provision is\nconfirmed by the relevant Conference Committee report, which noted that \"[t]he requirement to furnish assistance\n`with reasonable promptness' will still permit the States sufficient time to make adequate investigations but will\nnot permit them to establish waiting lists for individuals eligible for assistance.\" Conf. Rep. No. 2271, 81st Cong.,\n2d Sess. (1950), reprinted in 1950 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3287, 3482, 3507; see also H.R.Rep. No. 1300, 81st Cong., 1st\nSess. 48 (1949) (decision by states \"not to take more applications or to keep eligible families on waiting lists until\nenough recipients could be removed from the assistance rolls to make a place for them ... results in undue\n\nhardship on needy persons and is inappropriate in a program financed from federal funds\"); 95 Cong.Rec. 13,934\n(Oct. 5, 1949) (remarks of Rep. Forand) (noting that the proposed amendment to the Social Security Act would\nprohibit the \"discriminatory practice\" of not granting aid to applicants until persons already on the assistance rolls\ncease to receive assistance).\nIt follows from Jefferson that the Medicaid Act's reasonable promptness requirement, set forth at § 1396a(a)(8),\nprohibits states from responding to budgetary constraints in such a way as to cause otherwise eligible recipients\nto be placed on waiting lists for treatment. See Morgan v. Cohen, 665 F.Supp. 1164, 1177 (E.D.Pa.1987); see\nalso Linton v. Carney, 779 F.Supp. 925 (M.D.Tenn.1990) (Tennessee's policy of limiting the number of beds in\nMedicaid participating nursing homes that could be used for Medicaid patients violated § 1396a(a)(8) by causing\nthose patients \"to experience extended delays and waiting lists in attempting to gain access to long term nursing\nhome care\"); cf. Clark v. Kizer, 758 F.Supp. 572, 580 (E.D.Cal.1990) (granting summary judgment to plaintiffs on\n1149 reasonable promptness *1149 claim because the undisputed declarations of county public health officials\nindicated that \"class members frequently experience delays in obtaining appointments for regular and emergency\ndental care with those providers participating in Denti-Cal\"), aff'd in part and vacated in part on other grounds sub\nnom., Clark v. Coye, 967 F.2d 585 (9th Cir. 1992) (table). Compare King v. Sullivan, 776 F.Supp. 645, 648, 651\n(D.R.I.1991) (plaintiffs charged that Rhode Island did not spend enough money on intermediate care facilities for\nthe mentally retarded (\"ICF-MR\"); where State had offered plaintiffs \"medical assistance\" through placement in a\npublic ICF-MR center, plaintiffs not entitled to summary judgment notwithstanding their contention that they were\n[58]\nentitled to private ICF-MR services).\nThe undisputed evidence in this case demonstrates that the insufficient funding by the State and counties of\nmethadone maintenance treatment slots has caused providers of methadone maintenance to place eligible\nindividuals on waiting lists for treatment. This is precisely the sort of state procedure the reasonable promptness\n[59]\nprovision is designed to prevent.  Plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment on this claim.\nIV. Due Process Claim\nPlaintiffs allege that the State failed to provide them with \"notice or meaningful hearing\" before terminating their\nMedi-Cal funded methadone maintenance services. Merritt Compl., ¶ 90. Specifically, plaintiffs claim that the\nfailure of the State to provide for notice from the State and for State hearings violates their right to due process.\nPls.' Opp'n to Mot. to Dismiss at 14.\nDefendants do not dispute that plaintiffs have a legitimate claim of entitlement to the continued receipt of\nMedicaid services and that due process must be provided. Rather, defendants seek summary judgment on the\n[60]\nbasis that the existing fair hearing procedures provide all the process that is constitutionally required.\nAs evidence that the State has an established procedure which comports with due process, defendants offer the\ndeclaration of a Department official that each county which receives Drug/Medi-Cal funds must establish fair\nhearing procedures consistent with those included in the interagency agreement between the Department of\nHealth Services and the Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs. Supplemental Decl. of Venus Little, ¶¶ 2, 3 &\n4. The agreement states that \"[e]ach Medi-Cal beneficiary has the right to a fair hearing related to denial,\ntermination or reduction of [Drug/Medi-Cal] services\" and establishes procedures under which that hearing is to\n1150 be given. Defs.' Ex. 1, Attach. B at 7. Drug/Medi-Cal recipients are entitled *1150 to a hearing under the\nprocedures governing the rights of Medi-Cal beneficiaries in general (Title 22 of the Code of California\nRegulations) as well as under the procedures governing services administered by the Department of Alcohol and\nDrug Programs (Title 9). Id. at 8. Providers must inform beneficiaries in writing ten days prior to any termination\nor reduction of their benefits, and beneficiaries may request a hearing administered by the State Department of\nSocial Services. Id. at 7.\nPlaintiffs suggest that this fair hearing procedure is constitutionally deficient because it requires providers rather\nthan the State, or the counties as agents of the State, to provide written notice to beneficiaries concerning benefit\ntermination. But plaintiffs provide no authority for the position that the duty to provide notice may not be delegated\nby the State to providers. In Frank v. Kizer, 213 Cal.App.3d 919, 261 Cal.Rptr. 882 (1989), the court did not hold\n\nthat due process prohibits the State from delegating the notice-giving function to Medi-Cal providers. In fact, the\nplaintiffs in Frank did not allege a violation of due process; instead, they claimed that the State's refusal to\nprovide a 10-day notice of termination in all cases violated federal regulations not at issue here. Id. at 921, 924,\n261 Cal.Rptr. at 884, 886. Because the State conceded in Frank that its notice policy violated federal regulations,\nthe court never expressly ruled whether the delegation to providers was permissible. See id. at 922, 261 Cal.Rptr.\nat 885. As a result, plaintiffs' reliance on Frank is misplaced. There is no other authority offered for the surprising\nproposition that the State may not delegate the giving of notice to private providers any more than it may not\ndelegate the delivery of \"State notice\" to the United States Postal Service. What is important under the\n[61]\nConstitution is that notice be given, not who generates or delivers the notice.\nFurther, plaintiffs make no showing that the State's constitutionally adequate procedures have not been put into\neffect. Plaintiffs' sole evidentiary offering consists of a declaration by the attorney for a Medi-Cal recipient residing\nin Los Angeles County who was notified in August of 1992 that her Medi-Cal funded methadone maintenance\n[62]\n\"slot\" was being eliminated.  Decl. of Barbara A. Jones, ¶ 2. This recipient \"received no written notice of action\nadvising her that her Medi-Cal was being limited or terminated\" nor did she \"receive any written notification that\n[63]\nshe had a right to a state hearing.\" Id., ¶ 3.  Even if this one recipient received no constitutionally sufficient\nnotice, failure to notify in a single instance does not indicate that the State has failed to put its fair hearing\nprocedures into practice.\nAt oral argument, plaintiffs challenged the adequacy of the fair hearing procedure on the ground that it exists only\nin the counties' \"utilization control plans\" and that there is no relationship between utilization review and the\ndecision to terminate plaintiffs' methadone maintenance treatment. Plaintiffs, however, offer only argument on this\n1151 point, *1151 not evidence.[64] Similarly, plaintiffs argue, without supporting evidence, that the State does not\nmonitor providers' compliance with the hearing procedure.\nBecause plaintiffs have not shown either that the State's fair hearing procedure is unconstitutional on its face or\nthat it is ignored in practice, the record cannot support a finding of a violation of due process. See Matsushita\nElec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 585-87, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 1355-56, 89 L.Ed.2d 538\n(1986). The court grants summary judgment on this claim to defendants.\nV. Conclusion\nIt may well be that the State's system of distribution of methadone maintenance treatment through the counties is\na reasonable one, which takes into account the needs of eligible patients, the wishes of the local community, and\nthe State's budgetary constraints. The only question for the court, however, is whether this system violates the\nvarious provisions of the Medicaid Act which limit the discretion of participating states.\nFor the reasons stated above, defendants' motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs' due process claim is\ngranted. Defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiffs' claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a) is denied, except as to the\nclaim under § 1396a(a)(5), the \"single state agency\" provision. This claim is dismissed, and plaintiffs' motion for\nsummary judgment on the claim is denied. Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment also is denied as to the claims\nbrought under 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30), the equal access provision, and 42 C.F.R. § 440.230(b), the regulation\nrequiring service sufficient in amount, duration, and scope.\nPlaintiffs have established a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(1), the\nstatewide provision. Further, they have demonstrated that the balance of hardships tips in their favor. Accordingly,\nthe motion for preliminary injunction is granted on the basis that the State Medicaid plan is not in effect statewide.\n[65]\n In addition, plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment is granted with respect to the claims brought under 42\nU.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(10)(B) & 1396a(a)(8), the comparability and reasonable promptness requirements.\nIn accordance with the discussion in parts III.C and III.F of this memorandum, the court contemplates a\npermanent injunction requiring the State to assure that all eligible categorically needy individuals receive\nmethadone maintenance treatment services that are equal in amount, duration, and scope; that all eligible\ncategorically needy persons receive methadone maintenance treatment services that are at least equal in\n\namount, duration, and scope to services provided to medically needy persons; and that no persons eligible for\nMedi-Cal funded methadone maintenance treatment services will be placed on waiting lists for such services due\nto budgetary constraints. The court requests that the parties meet and confer as to the precise terms of the\npermanent injunction. Within 21 days of the date this order is filed, the parties shall submit a proposed order, if\nthey can agree. Otherwise, the parties shall submit by that date separate orders with a brief in support of the\nproposed order. The court may then require an additional hearing.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n[1] Defendant Smoley has been substituted for Russell S. Gould in her official capacity as Secretary of the\nCalifornia Health and Welfare Agency. The other defendants also are health officials of the State of California\nsued in their official capacities.\n[2] In an order filed on December 14, 1992, this case was consolidated with Merritt v. Belshe, Civ. S-92-1905. The\nparties stipulated to certification of a plaintiff class defined as \"all persons in the State of California eligible for\nMedi-Cal for whom methadone maintenance treatment is medically necessary and otherwise appropriate but who\nare, or may be in the future, unable to obtain methadone maintenance treatment through the Medi-Cal program.\"\n[3] The Medicaid Act was enacted as Title XIX to the Social Security Act (\"SSA\") in 1965 in order to establish a\nsingle and separate medical care program to replace medical programs already existing in five different titles of\nthe SSA. See H.R.Rep. No. 213, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. (1965), reprinted in Robert B. Stevens, Statutory History\nof the United States: Income Security 736 (1970).\n[4] In California, Medi-Cal is available to the \"categorically needy,\" which includes public assistance recipients\nand persons receiving Supplemental Security Income (\"SSI\"), as well as to the \"medically needy,\" which includes\ncertain individuals whose income is insufficient to meet the cost of necessary medical treatment. Cal. Welf. &\nInst.Code §§ 14005-14005.7. \"Medically needy\" recipients are required to pay a share of the cost of their medical\ntreatment. Id. §§ 14005.7-14005.9. The Medicaid Act defines \"categorically needy\" and \"medically needy\"\nindividuals in the same way as the Medi-Cal program. See 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(A).\n[5] \"Drug/Medi-Cal\" is the term used by the State to designate its Medi-Cal funded drug abuse treatment\nservices. In addition to methadone maintenance, the other Drug/Medi-Cal services reimbursable under\nCalifornia's Medicaid plan are \"drug free treatment,\" \"day care habilitative treatment,\" and \"naltrexone treatment.\"\nDefs.' Ex. 1.\n[6] Defendants filed two lists of material facts in support of their opposition to plaintiffs' first motion for summary\njudgment. The reference in the text is to the statement titled \"State Defendants' Statement of Material Facts as to\nwhich there is a Genuine Issue Precluding Summary Judgment,\" which lists both disputed and undisputed facts.\n[7] Before this action was filed, Alameda County decided to eliminate most methadone maintenance services\nfrom its county drug program plan. In response, in September 1992, the Department of Alcohol and Drug\nPrograms took over the administration of Medi-Cal methadone maintenance services in Alameda County. The\nState, through the Department, now contracts directly with Alameda County methadone maintenance providers. \nAlthough these events have mooted plaintiffs' claims against Alameda County officials, the remaining 57 counties\nin the State continue to operate under the decentralized system described in the text.\n[8] Under the Medicaid Act, the federal government reimburses the states for a portion of the cost of the states'\nMedicaid programs. The states' share of the cost is referred to as state \"matching funds.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1396b; \nCharleston Memorial Hosp. v. Conrad, 693 F.2d 324, 326 (4th Cir.1982).\n[9] However, the county must \"match\" 10 to 15 percent of the funds not spent on Drug/Medi-Cal services. Id. §\n11987.4.\n[10] Apparently, the dollar limit on services specified in the contracts with providers is subject to increase during\nthe course of the contract period. Decl. of Venus Little, ¶ 6; Decl. of Donald Nikkel, ¶ 8. The defendants, however,\n\ndo not identify or describe the process through which additional funds are sought and provided. See Defs.'\nStatement of Material Facts, ¶ 18.\n[11] County discretion to determine the amount of their State general fund allocation to devote to Drug/Medi-Cal\nservices is subject to the Department's approval of county drug program plans. Cal.Health & Safety Code §\n11983.1. The record reveals one instance where State oversight was invoked 00 in Alameda County, as described\n97\nin note 7 supra.\n[12] There is some conflict in the record. The Department's \"Methadone Program List,\" dated September 7, 1992,\nlists 24 counties with licensed methadone maintenance providers 00 18 of which offer Medi-Cal funded treatment\n97\nand six which do not. Pls.' Ex. 21; see also Def. Molly Joel Coye's Resp. to Pls.' Second Set of Interrogs., No. 4.\nIn contrast, the Jarfors declaration indicates that there are licensed providers in 26 counties.\n[13] In 1990, the Department wrote to county drug program administrators in an effort \"to clarify a question which\nhas regularly surfaced regarding the provision of drug treatment services to Drug/Medi-Cal (D/MC) beneficiaries\n... because several counties do not participate in the D/MC program.\" The State informed the counties that \"[d]rug\ntreatment programs which have D/MC funding and space (slots) available cannot deny program access to non-\ncounty residents which [sic] are D/MC beneficiaries.\" Pls.' Ex. 18.\n[14] By contrast, \"heroin detoxification\" treatment, which is a short-term treatment using methadone to achieve\ndetoxification within 21 days, see Cal.Code Regs. tit. 22, §§ 51116 & 51328, is a drug abuse treatment service\nthat is not included in the Drug/Medi-Cal program, but instead is available under the traditional \"fee-for-service\"\nscheme. As a result, detoxification treatment is available upon presentment of a Medi-Cal card to a certified\nprovider. Lefkin Dep., 62:4-25; Defs.' Statement of Material Facts, ¶¶ 9 & 10.\n[15] As one example, plaintiff Lisa Quilling receives $504 per month through AFDC and $140 per month in food\nstamps for her and her four-year-old son. After her Medi-Cal methadone maintenance slot was cut, she paid the\n$225 per month charged for treatment and could no longer afford to pay her rent of $475 per month. She avers\nthat she was evicted as a result and is now homeless. Because of her medical condition, her doctors have\nadvised her to continue with methadone maintenance treatment. She states that she has been unable to find a\njob, an apartment she can afford, or Medi-Cal funded treatment in another clinic. Quilling Decl., ¶¶ 2, 5, 8, 9, 10,\n12, 13, 14, 16 & 17.\n[16] Plaintiffs move for summary judgment or alternatively for preliminary injunctive relief on claims one, two,\nthree, five, six, seven, and ten of the Sobky complaint, and claims one, two, three, four, six, and seven in Merritt.\nWith the exceptions of Sobky claim ten and Merritt claim three, all of these claims assert violations of the six\nMedicaid plan requirements listed above. Sobky claim ten asserts a cause of action for declaratory relief. Merritt\nclaim three asserts violations of 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23), which concerns free choice of providers. Plaintiffs'\nbriefing contains no argument or evidence regarding the § 1396a(a)(23) claim, however, and the court assumes\nthat it was erroneously included within the scope of this motion.\n[17] Defendants' motion to dismiss encompasses five claims which are not included within the plaintiffs' motions.\nDefs.' Supp.Mot. to Dismiss at 2-3. Four of these five (Sobky claims four, eight, and nine and Merritt claim five)\nassert violations of additional Medicaid state plan requirements. Defendants offer no arguments regarding the\nmerits of the claims and request dismissal only on the basis that plaintiffs have no cause of action to enforce the\nstatutory provisions. However, defendants have failed to specifically analyze the enforceability of each claim\nasserted, as required by Suter v. Artist M., ___ U.S. ___, ___ n. 8, 112 S.Ct. 1360, 1367 n. 8, 118 L.Ed.2d 1\n(1992) (holding that \"each statute must be interpreted by its own terms\"). Because the briefing is inadequate to\nenable the court to determine whether these four claims should be dismissed, the motion to dismiss is denied as\nto these claims without further discussion.\n[18] 42 U.S.C. § 1983 provides a right of action against any person who, under of color of state law, deprives\nanother of \"any rights, privileges or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws [of the United States].\"\n[19] Even if the plaintiff successfully asserts the violation of an enforceable right, the defendant may defeat the\ncause of action by showing that Congress specifically foreclosed a remedy under § 1983 in the enactment itself\n00 either expressly or by enacting a comprehensive enforcement scheme. Golden State, 493 U.S. at 106-07, 110\n97\n\nS.Ct. at 448-49. However, in Wilder v. Virginia Hosp. Ass'n, 496 U.S. 498, 110 S.Ct. 2510, 110 L.Ed.2d 455\n(1990), the Court found that Congress had not foreclosed enforcement of the Medicaid Act under § 1983. Id. at\n520-23, 110 S.Ct. at 2523-25. Although the Wilder analysis specifically focuses on § 1983 actions by providers, it\nappears equally applicable to actions brought by Medicaid recipients. In any event, the State does not argue that\nCongress has foreclosed recipient private rights of action under the Medicaid Act.\n[20] The facts and reasoning of Wilder and Suter are thoroughly discussed in the case law, and consequently not\nrepeated here. See Arkansas Medical Soc'y, Inc. v. Reynolds, 6 F.3d 519 (8th Cir.1993); Chan v. City of New\nYork, 1 F.3d 96 (2d Cir.),cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 114 S.Ct. 472, 126 L.Ed.2d 423 (1993); Clifton v. Schafer,\n969 F.2d 278 (7th Cir.1992); Stowell v. Ives, 976 F.2d 65 (1st Cir.1992); Evelyn V. v. Kings County Hosp. Ctr., 819\nF.Supp. 183 (E.D.N.Y.1993).\n[21]Wilder involved the enforceability of the Boren Amendment, a different subsection of the same statute at\nissue here.\n[22] Like the Medicaid Act, the Adoption Act was enacted by Congress under its spending power contained in\nArticle I, § 8, cl. 1 of the Constitution. Suter, ___ U.S. at ___, 112 S.Ct. at 1366. The Adoption Act establishes a\nprogram to reimburse states for expenses incurred in administering foster care and adoption services in\naccordance with federal requirements. To receive federal funds, states must submit a plan for the approval of the\nSecretary of Health and Human Services that meets 16 listed requirements. Id. at ___ - ___, 112 S.Ct. at\n1363-64.\n[23] The Suter opinion includes some language framing the issue more narrowly 00 that is, whether Congress\n97\n\"unambiguously confer[red] upon [the plaintiffs] a right to enforce the requirement\" sought to be enforced. Suter,\n___ U.S. at ___, 112 S.Ct. at 1367. Taken literally, however, such a requirement would foreclose a § 1983 action\nin every case except where the statute expressly conferred such a right. Given that Suter does not overrule \nWilder or Golden State, this language on ambiguity is more reasonably read in light of Pennhurst, from which it\nderives. In Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17, 101 S.Ct. at 1540, it was the condition placed on the grant of federal\nmoney which was required to be unambiguous, not the conferral of a right of action to enforce the condition. See \nEvelyn V. v. Kings County Hosp. Ctr., 819 F.Supp. 183, 193 (E.D.N.Y.1993).\n[24] In arguing that the provisions sought to be enforced require nothing more from the State than the submission\nof a State plan, defendants fail to analyze why this is so in terms of the specific language of each provision. But \nSuter requires just this sort of analysis. Further, by lumping all of the statutory conditions together, defendants\nappear to suggest that the entire Medicaid Act merely requires states to submit a plan. Defs.' Reply in Mot. to\nDismiss at 4. Defendants acknowledge, however, that Suter is not \"so sweeping\" as to make unenforceable every\nprovision of the Medicaid Act. Id. at 2.\n[25] The Wilder Court rejected this view, in part, based on consideration of regulations which allow the Secretary\nto withhold federal funds whenever the state plan does not comply and whenever there is \"noncompliance in\npractice.\" Id. These regulations, set forth at 42 C.F.R. § 430.35, apply to all plan requirements in § 1396a. See 42\nC.F.R. § 403.35(a)(1).\n[26] In attempting to reconcile Wilder and Suter, the Seventh Circuit characterizes Wilder as holding \"simply that\nhealth care providers could sue to enforce their right to a state plan that did not violate the Boren Amendment; it\ndid not hold that providers had a right to challenge any deviation the state might make from a plan that did\ncomply with federal law.\" Clifton v. Schafer, 969 F.2d 278, 285 (7th Cir.1992). Clifton is rather grudgingly followed\nin another Seventh Circuit opinion, Procopio v. Johnson, 994 F.2d 325, 332 (7th Cir.1993) (\"For better or for\nworse, then, under the authority of this circuit, Artist M. precludes the [plaintiffs'] federal statutory claim.\"). \nAs the Procopio court recognizes, Clifton is somewhat difficult to reconcile with certain aspects of Suter. In\nparticular, Suter distinguished Wilder not on the basis that the Wilder plaintiffs were asserting their right to a\nconforming state plan, but instead on the basis that the particular plan requirement sought to be enforced in \nWilder was detailed and specific. See Procopio, 994 F.2d at 331 n. 11. Because of this specificity, the statute at\nissue in Wilder imposed more than a requirement for a plan; it imposed substantive requirements on the State:\n\nIn Wilder, the underlying Medicaid legislation similarly required participating states to submit to the Secretary ... a\nplan for medical assistance describing the State's Medicaid program. But in that case we held that the Boren\nAmendment actually required the States to adopt reasonable and adequate rates, and that this obligation was\nenforceable by the providers. We relied in part on the fact that the statute and regulations set forth in some detail\nthe factors to be considered in determining the methods for calculating rates.\nSuter, ___ U.S. at ___, 112 S.Ct. at 1308 (emphasis added). In light of this passage from Suter, Clifton loses its\npersuasive force. Clifton has recently been further called into question within the Seventh Circuit by Miller v.\nWhitburn, 10 F.3d 1315, 1319 (7th Cir.1993) (holding that plaintiff could enforce Medicaid Act sections concerning\nearly and periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment services (\"EPSDT\"); distinguishing Clifton on ground that\nthe provisions at issue in Miller set forth in some detail the services for which a Medicaid-participating state must\nprovide payment in order to discharge its EPSDT obligations).\nThe First Circuit's statement in Stowell, 976 F.2d at 70, that it is adopting a \"substantially identical view of the \nWilder/Suter interface\" as the Clifton court is dictum. Stowell concerned the enforceability of 42 U.S.C. § 1396a\n(c)(1) which, by its terms, imposes an obligation exclusively upon federal officials. Stowell, 976 F.2d at 70; see\nalso Audette v. Sullivan, 19 F.3d 254, 256-57 (6th Cir.1994) (following Stowell). Hence, Stowell is quite different\nfrom the circumstances here, in which plaintiffs seek to enforce provisions directed to the states. Moreover, the\nFirst Circuit held, subsequent to Stowell, that two sections of the AFDC statute provide enforceable rights under §\n1983 because they place mandatory obligations on states, not just on federal officials. Albiston v. Maine Comm'r\nof Human Serv., 7 F.3d 258, 264-67 (1st Cir.1993).\n[27] The regulations addressing statewide operation of the plan provide: \n(b) State plan requirements. A State plan must provide that the following requirements are met:\n(1) The plan will be in operation statewide through a system of local offices, under equitable standards for\nassistance and administration that are mandatory throughout the state.\n. . . . .\n(3) The agency will ensure that the plan is continuously in operation in all local offices or agencies through 00\n97\n(i) Methods for informing staff of State policies, standards, procedures, and instructions;\n(ii) Systematic planned examination and evaluation of operations in local offices ...; and\n(iii) Reports, controls or other methods.\n(c) Exceptions. (1) \"Statewide operation\" does not mean, for example, that every source of service must furnish\nthe service State-wide. The requirement does not preclude the agency from contracting with a comprehensive\nhealth care organization ... that serves a specific area of the State, to furnish services to Medicaid recipients who\nlive in that area and cho[o]se to receive services from that [organization]. Recipients who live in other parts of the\nState may receive their services from other sources.\n42 C.F.R. § 431.50.\n[28] The parties have not briefed whether the provider plaintiffs are intended beneficiaries of the statewide\nprovision. Because § 1396a(a)(1) is enforceable by the recipient plaintiffs, it is unnecessary to reach this\nquestion. Should the issue become relevant later in the case, additional briefing may be required.\n[29] The Court rejected the Suter plaintiffs' argument that the requirement that a plan be \"in effect\" statewide\nindicated Congress' intent that each of the 58 plan requirements included in the Medicaid statute imposes a\nsubstantive, enforceable obligation on the states. Suter, ___ U.S. at ___, 112 S.Ct. at 1368. Plaintiffs here,\nhowever, seek to enforce the statewide requirement itself, not to use the provision to bolster the argument that a\ncause of action exists to enforce other sections.\n\n[30] The efficacy of the Secretary's power to withhold funds is subject to question given that the Secretary no\nlonger requires the State to submit for review the interagency agreement between the Department of Health\nServices and the Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs. See Decl. of James C. Cicconetti, ¶ 5.\n[31] What the State plan actually promises is ambiguous. The interagency agreement between the Department of\nHealth Services and the Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs describes the obligation of the latter to\nprovide drug treatment services under Medi-Cal, but does not describe in detail the implementation scheme used\nin the delivery of services. The agreement dated July 1, 1984, which was approved as a Medicaid plan\namendment by the Secretary of Health and Human Services in November 1984, contains two relevant provisions:\n(1) The Department \"shall ensure that [Drug/Medi-Cal] local drug abuse treatment services are available to\neligible Medi-Cal beneficiaries in need of such services\"; and (2) the Department \"shall assure that each local\ndrug abuse program shall provide, or contract for provision of, the services covered under the terms of this\nagreement.\" Attachment D to Defs.' Ex. 1, ¶¶ IVA & IVC. The agreement also refers to the state statutory scheme\nproviding for county coordination of services and county-initiated contracts with providers. Attachment A to Defs.'\nEx. 1, at 1. \nThe interagency agreement is re-executed every year. Defs.' Ex. 2. The most recent version of the agreement in\nthe record, effective through June 30, 1993, still contains the first clause quoted above, but modifies the second\none to read: The Department \"shall assure that each local substance abuse program which participates in the\n[Drug/Medi-Cal] program shall provide, or contract for the provision of, the services covered under the term [sic]\nof this agreement.\" Attachment B to Defs.' Ex. 1, ¶ IVC (emphasis added). It is unclear whether this latest version\nhas been \"approved\" by the Secretary. See Defs.' Ex. 2.\nWhatever the requirements of the written plan, the parties do not dispute that the State's practice is to give the\ncounties (with the exception of Alameda County) discretion whether and how much to fund Medi-Cal methadone\nmaintenance treatment. Defs.' Statement of Material Facts, ¶ 14. It is this method of implementing the plan, and\nnot the plan itself, that plaintiffs challenge. See Pls.' Opp'n to Mot. to Dismiss at 13 n. 3; Pls.' Reply in first\nSumm.J.Mot. at 1-2.\n[32] At oral argument, plaintiffs stated that they do not seek greater access to methadone maintenance treatment\nthan that enjoyed by private-pay patients in the geographic area, but merely comparable access. Under other\nprovisions of the Medicaid Act, the State would not be required to provide greater access to the service by, for\nexample, providing sufficient payments to providers to ensure that a methadone clinic exists in every county. 42\nU.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30). However, a state may be required to provide transportation services to and from\nproviders. 42 C.F.R. § 431.53.\n[33] To obtain a preliminary injunction, a party must show either (1) likelihood of success on the merits and the\npossibility of irreparable injury, or (2) the existence of serious questions going to the merits and the balance of\nhardships tipping in its favor. These are not separate tests, but the \"outer reaches of a single continuum.\" Los\nAngeles Memorial Coliseum v. National Football League, 634 F.2d 1197, 1201 (9th Cir.1980).\n[34] The Arkansas Medical Soc'y court referred here to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare\nHandbook of Public Assistance Administration, Supplement D: Medical Assistance Programs (1966-1967) Part\n7-5340. Id. at 527.\n[35] Although the information provided in this declaration is less than straightforward, plaintiffs do not dispute\ndefendants' claim that Medi-Cal reimbursement rates are comparable to private fees.\n[36] A State plan for medical assistance must ... provide ... that the medical assistance made available to any\n[categorically needy] individual ... 00 \n97\n(i) shall not be less in amount, duration, or scope than the medical assistance made available to any other such\nindividual, and\n(ii) shall not be less in amount, duration, or scope than the medical assistance made available to [medically\nneedy] individuals.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(B).\nSee note 4 supra for the definition of categorically and medically needy.\n[37] 42 C.F.R. § 440.240 provides, in relevant part, that: \n(a) The [state] plan must provide that the services available to any categorically needy recipient under the plan\nare not less in amount, duration, and scope than those services available to a medically needy recipient; and\n(b) The plan must provide that the services available to any individual in the following groups are equal in\namount, duration, and scope for all recipients within the group:\n(1) The categorically needy.\n(2) A covered medically needy group.\n[38] Defendants argue that the record is not sufficiently developed for summary judgment on this claim. It may be\nthat some methadone maintenance providers have not maintained records pertaining to waiting lists in a very\nmeticulous manner. However, defendants have never disputed plaintiffs' ultimate factual contention 00 that some\n97\nplaintiffs are categorically needy and are eligible for methadone maintenance treatment but have been forced\neither to obtain such treatment privately or to wait for a Medi-Cal funded treatment slot to open.\n[39] Defendants also claim, without citation to any authority, that § 1396a(a)(10)(B)(ii) 00 the provision which\n97\nrequires that categorically needy individuals receive medical assistance not less in amount, duration, or scope\nthan that made available to medically needy individuals 00 is only intended to prevent discrimination against the\n97\ncategorically needy as a group as opposed to individual instances of unequal treatment. Defendants' argument is\nbelied by 42 C.F.R. § 440.240(a), which requires that a \"plan must provide that the services available to any\ncategorically needy recipient under the plan are not less in amount, duration, and scope than those services\navailable to a medically needy recipient.\" 42 C.F.R. § 440.240(a) (emphasis added). This regulation is a\npermissible construction of § 1396a(a)(10)(B) by the agency charged with responsibility for enforcing the\nMedicaid Act and is due great deference. See Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 434, 91 S.Ct. 849, 855,\n28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971).\n[40] The first version of § 1396a(a)(10)(B) was added to the Social Security Act in the Social Security Act\nAmendments of 1965. It provided, in relevant part: \nSec. 1902. (a) A State plan for medical assistance must 00 ...\n97\n(10) provide for making medical assistance available to all individuals receiving aid or assistance under State\nplans approved under titles I, IV, X, XIV, and XVI; and 00\n97\n(A) provide that the medical assistance under any such State plan 00\n97\n(i) shall not be less in amount, duration, or scope than the medical assistance made available to individuals\nreceiving aid or assistance under any other such State plan, and\n(ii) shall not be less in amount, duration, or scope than the medical or remedial care and services made available\nto individuals not receiving aid or assistance under any such plan ...\nSocial Security Act Amendments of 1965, § 121 (emphasis added), reprinted in Stevens, supra note 3, at 765-66.\n[41] Although the legislative history of predecessor bills may be relevant to discerning the legislative intent of a\nlater enactment, see Estate of Cowart, ___ U.S. at ___, 112 S.Ct. at 2595, an inquiry into such legislative history\nordinarily is not necessary when the language of the later enactment is clear. See Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886,\n896, 104 S.Ct. 1541, 1548, 79 L.Ed.2d 891 (1984) (\"[W]e look first to the statutory language and then to the\nlegislative history if the statutory language is unclear.\"); Estate of Cowart, ___ U.S. at ___, 112 S.Ct. at 2594\n(\"[W]hen a statute speaks with clarity to an issue judicial inquiry into the statute's meaning, in all but the most\nextraordinary circumstance, is finished.\").\n\n[42] 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(17) provides, in relevant part, that a \"State plan for medical assistance must ... include\nreasonable standards (which shall be comparable for all groups [of the categorically needy] ...) for determining\neligibility for and the extent of medical assistance under the plan.\"\n[43]Greenstein v. Bane, 833 F.Supp. 1054 (S.D.N.Y.1993), also fails to support defendants' position. In \nGreenstein, the court held that the State of New York violated § 1396a(a)(10)(B) by failing to fully reimburse\ncategorically needy persons who had incurred out-of-pocket expenses for authorized Medicaid services due to\nagency error and delay. See id. at 1061, 1073-74. There is no indication that the plaintiffs in Greenstein belonged\nto one particular categorically needy group and that the members of other categorically needy groups were not\nexperiencing the same problems as the plaintiffs.\n[44]See Pigou, John Maynard Keynes, in 32 Proceedings of the British Academy 407.\n[45] The evidence in the record establishes that plaintiffs suffer homelessness, exposure to disease, medical\ncomplications resulting in hospitalization, and risk probation revocation as a result of not being able to obtain\nmethadone maintenance treatment through Medi-Cal. Thus, methadone maintenance treatment beginning\ntomorrow has a greater value than does the same treatment beginning in six months, because treatment\ntomorrow may spare a patient from enduring six months of suffering.\n[46] In particular, defendants point to 42 U.S.C. § 1396, which provides that federal funds are appropriated under\nthe Medicaid Act \"[f]or the purpose of enabling each State, as far as practicable under the conditions in such\nState,\" to furnish medical assistance.\n[47] For example, the State may limit continuing methadone maintenance treatment to those persons who remain\ndrug-free or may eliminate funding for methadone maintenance altogether.\n[48] However, this conclusion is not obvious from the regulation itself, and the uncertainty is enhanced by the\nexistence of § 440.240 of the regulations. Section 440.240 paraphrases the requirements of § 1396a(a)(10)(B)\nand thus, unlike § 440.230, clearly derives from the statute.\n[49] In Oklahoma Nursing Home Ass'n v. Demps, 792 F.Supp. 721, 726 (W.D.Okla. 1992), the court rejected the\nvery narrow view that the Court in Wright used the regulation only to help define a statutory term. However, \"\nWright does not support the broad proposition that federal agency regulations, standing alone, may create rights\nenforceable under section 1983.\" Id. Instead, \"it supports the proposition that courts may look to administrative\nregulations to define the scope of rights created by statute.\" Id.\n[50] Section 1396a(a)(5) provides for several exceptions not relevant here.\n[51] Plaintiffs confine their analysis and argument to urging the enforceability of the Medicaid Act by the recipient\nplaintiffs. Pls.' Supp. in first Summ.J.Mot. at 23. However, the single state agency requirement is equally\nunenforceable by the provider plaintiffs, for the same reasons it is unenforceable by recipients.\n[52] Plaintiffs' reliance on a statement in Hillburn v. Maher, 795 F.2d 252 (2d Cir.1986),cert. denied,479 U.S.\n1046, 107 S.Ct. 910, 93 L.Ed.2d 859 (1987), is misplaced. Read carefully, Hillburn actually supports the view that\nthe section's purpose is administrative efficiency. See id. at 261 (the reason for the single state agency\nrequirement \"was to avoid a lack of accountability for the appropriate operation of the program\"). While Hillburn\ncites to a legislative history reference suggesting a second purpose of providing services to recipients, a review\nof that reference (1965 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2016-17) shows that it construes a different Medicaid plan requirement,\n42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(19). The legislative history of another section is not particularly persuasive in light of Suter\n's directive to examine separately each provision sought to be enforced. In the pre-Suter case of Morgan v.\nCohen, 665 F.Supp. 1164, 1177 (E.D.Pa.1987), the court uncritically relies on Hillburn's legislative history\nanalysis and considers the purpose of other provisions of the Medicaid Act in determining that the single state\nagency requirement could be enforced by recipients. \nSimilarly, other cases addressing substantive violations of § 1396a(a)(5) do so without analysis of the\njurisdictional issue. See Fulkerson v. Maine Dep't of Human Serv., 802 F.Supp. 529, 538 (D.Me.1992); Linton v.\nCarney, 779 F.Supp. 925, 936 (E.D.Tenn.1990); Forsyth County Bd. of Social Serv. v. Division of Social Serv.,\n\n346 S.E.2d 414, 417 (N.C.1986). Of these cases, only Fulkerson is post-Suter. Fulkerson, however, does not\ndiscuss Suter even though Suter was decided several months before.\n[53] In holding that the AFDC statute's reasonable promptness provision creates a judicially enforceable right, the\nFirst Circuit found that, \"to the extent further guidance may be required to demarcate the contours of reasonable\n`promptness,'\" an AFDC regulation which contains language identical to that of 42 C.F.R. § 435.930 sufficiently\ndid so. See id. at 267.\n[54] That regulation provides, in relevant part: \n(a) The agency must establish time standards for determining eligibility and inform the applicant of what they are.\nThese standards may not exceed 00\n97\n(1) Ninety days for applicants who apply for Medicaid on the basis of disability; and\n(2) Forty-five days for all other applicants.\n. . . . .\n(c) The agency must determine eligibility within the standards except in unusual circumstances....\n(d) The agency must document the reasons for delay in the applicant's case record.\n(e) The agency must not use the time standards 00\n97\n(1) As a waiting period before determining eligibility....\n42 C.F.R. § 435.911.\n[55] The absence of more specific standards in the Medicaid regulations as to what other sorts of delays in the\ndelivery of medical assistance, such as those created by waiting lists for treatment, violate the reasonable\npromptness requirement is not surprising if the court is correct that this section was designed to eliminate\nprecisely those sorts of delays. See Part III.E.2. infra.\n[56] As noted earlier, plaintiffs have established that some of the methadone maintenance providers receive\ninsufficient funds to serve all the Medi-Cal eligible in need of treatment; in response, some providers have\ncreated waiting lists for the Medi-Cal funded slots. Nikkel Decl., ¶¶ 8, 9, 11; Slattery Decl., ¶ 10; Kueffner Dep.,\n100:13-101:6; Dep. of Reda Z. Sobky, 35:1-6, 37:23-38:1. For evidence that treatment is limited based on county\nof residence, see part III.A. supra.\n[57] In the previous Memorandum of Decision and Order, filed on October 26, 1993, the court rejected plaintiffs\nargument that delays in the furnishing of medical assistance caused by the placement of plaintiffs on waiting lists\nfor methadone maintenance treatment slots violate § 1396a(a)(8). Plaintiffs have moved for reconsideration of\nthis finding. Upon further review, the court concludes that its initial ruling was in error. Thus, plaintiffs' motion for\nreconsideration is granted.\n[58] It also should be noted that the regulation which implements § 1396a(a)(8) is hostile to waiting periods. See\n42 C.F.R. § 435.911(e) (\"The agency must not use the time standards 00 (1) As a waiting period before\n97\ndetermining eligibility. ...\").\n[59] Claiming that health care \"is fundamentally different than welfare,\" Opposition to Mot. for Reconsideration at\n4, defendants attempt to distinguish the meaning of reasonable promptness in the AFDC and Medicaid contexts.\nThis argument is unpersuasive. A waiting list for medical treatment due to insufficient funding is just as arbitrary\nas a waiting list to receive welfare checks. Congress has given states substantial discretion in determining\neligibility for various Medicaid-funded programs, and in setting the proper amount, scope, and duration of medical\nassistance to include in their Medicaid plans. As has been noted repeatedly throughout this opinion, the states\nhave the discretion to decline to provide any coverage for methadone maintenance. Moreover, in defining the\nnature and extent of covered medical services, the states may consider budgetary constraints. Once the services\nare selected and defined, however, the Medicaid Act does not permit the states to limit such assistance to some\n\nindividuals because of insufficient funding. This interpretation of the reasonable promptness provision is also\nconsistent with the comparability requirement.\n[60] Defendants' alternative argument that there is no state action is without merit. Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S.\n991, 1004, 102 S.Ct. 2777, 2786, 73 L.Ed.2d 534 (1982), is not controlling. State action did not exist in Blum\nwhen a private entity made a medical decision to transfer Medicaid patients to a lower level of care; the change in\nbenefits received from the State was merely the result of this private medical decision. Id. The situation here is\nmarkedly different. The decision to eliminate Medi-Cal funded methadone maintenance treatment slots was made\nby the counties, under authority delegated to them from the State, and the private providers merely executed this\ndecision. Accordingly, defendants have not shown that no state action exists.\n[61] Because plaintiffs fail to show that the State must issue the notice rather than the providers, the court does\nnot reach plaintiffs' claim that the State fails to maintain records of Medi-Cal patients receiving methadone\nmaintenance treatment and therefore has no mechanism in place to issue State notices.\n[62] Plaintiffs also cite to the deposition testimony of Ron Kletter in support of their claim that certain plaintiffs\nterminated from one methadone maintenance program did not receive state notices advising them that they had\na right to a state hearing. Pls.' Opp'n to Mot. to Dismiss at 18. However, the pages of the deposition transcript\ncited by plaintiffs, with one exception, do not reflect that Kletter was ever asked whether notice was given to\npatients. The fact that he did not voluntarily mention notice in his answers to questions addressed to other topics\nis insufficient to support plaintiffs' contention. On page 210 of the transcript, Kletter states only that he cannot\nrecall whether terminated patients received any written correspondence from the provider. Kletter Dep.,\n210:10-14.\n[63] The Jones declaration states only that one patient received no written notice either of the termination action\nor that she had a right to a state hearing 00 not that she received no notice at all. There are no facts from which\n97\nthe court can evaluate whether the actual process this plaintiff received satisfies the standards of Mathews v.\nEldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976). Thus, this declaration is insufficient to create a\ndisputed issue that equitable relief should be awarded to plaintiffs on the due process claim.\n[64] The allegations in the complaint 00 averring lack of due process afforded to 32 Medi-Cal recipients in\n97\nAlameda County when their benefits were withdrawn 00 actually tend to disprove plaintiffs' point. Paragraph 33\n97\nalleges that the Alameda County provider did in fact inform plaintiffs of their termination from Medi-Cal and\nparagraph 34 states that plaintiffs requested and received a hearing before \"an administrative law judge.\" This\nhearing was apparently conducted by the State of California. See Pls' Opp'n to Mot. to Dismiss at 16 n. 5. The\nprovider continued to treat these plaintiffs pending the hearing decision.
