Wilson,  96-16870,  and  Clark  v.  California,  96-16952.  Plaintiffs/Appellees  (hereinafter, \n“plaintiffs”) have reviewed the briefs filed by the plaintiffs and the United States Department of Justice in Armstrong and \nClark, which address many of the same questions of Eleventh Amendment immunity at issue in the instant appeal. Plaintiffs \nhave attempted wherever possible to avoid repetition and instead reference in footnotes those relevant portions of the briefing \nin Armstrong and Clark. \n  \nInstead, plaintiffs’ briefing in the instant case focuses on several issues which are unique to this appeal. Since we have \nasserted claims under the Medicaid Act and the Nursing Home Reform Act provisions of Medicaid, our brief addresses the \nlong history of applying Ex Pane Young in Medicaid actions against state officials for prospective and injunctive relief. \nSecondly, our claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) arise in the context of the right of persons with \ndisabilities to receive services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs - the ADA’s so-called “integration \nmandate.” Accordingly, our briefing focuses on this provision and its application to persons in nursing homes who seek \naccess to community services. Finally, we address the state’s attempt to mis-characterize this as a “deinstitutionalization” \ncase. \n  \nISSUES PRESENTED \n1. Whether the rule of Ex parte  Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908) permits this suit for prospective injunctive relief against state \ngovernmental officials for violating the federal Medicaid Act,  42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq., the Nursing Home Reform Act, \n42 U.S.C. § 1396r et seq. and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. \n  \n2. Whether Congress has the power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to enforce the Equal Protection Clause to \nremedy discrimination against people with disabilities and therefore has the authority to abrogate the state’s Eleventh \nAmendment immunity from suit under the ADA. \n  \nJURISDICTION \n1. Plaintiffs/Appellees (hereinafter “plaintiffs”) agree with defendants/appellants (hereinafter “defendants”) that the district \ncourt had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sections 1331 and 1343. \n  \n2. Plaintiffs agree with defendants that this Court has jurisdiction to hear the appeal of the district court’s order denying them \nabsolute immunity under the Eleventh Amendment. See  Puerto Rico Aqueduct & Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., \n8 \n \n\n \n \n \nWorth “”Buttercup’’ HALE, Ivo Sutich, Cheryl Ellison,..., 1997 WL 33555335...   \n \n \n506 U.S. 139 (1993). \n  \nATTORNEYS’ FEES \nIf successful, plaintiffs will seek their attorneys’ fees, costs and reasonable litigation expenses for defending this appeal \npursuant to  42 U.S.C. § 1988 and 42 U.S.C. § 12205. \n  \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nPlaintiffs brought this class action on behalf of a putative class of persons who presently reside in locked nursing facilities, \nknown as “Institutions for Mental Disease” (“SNF/IMD”) and persons who reside in communities all over California but who \nare at risk of being placed in SNF/IMDs because of defendants’ practices which they contend violate the Medicaid Act, the \nNursing Home Reform Act and the ADA. Excerpt of Record (“ER”) at 3,4. Plaintiffs’ claims under the state-federal \nMedicaid program challenge the defendants’ illegal administration of community mental health services. Specifically \nplaintiffs contend that defendants violate their statutory obligations under the federal Medicaid Act by: (1) allowing some \nMedi-Cal recipients to receive the services they need in the community while others are denied these services; (2) imposing \nillegal limitations on the amount, duration or scope of available mental health rehabilitative services; (3) allowing some \ncounties to decide on a county-by-county basis whether to make the services available with the result that in some counties a \nfull range of services is provided while in others there are few services available; and (4) not providing services promptly \nwhen and where needed. Having decided to seek and accept federal Medicaid funds for rehabilitative mental health services, \ndefendants are obligated to deliver them fairly and in accordance with federal law. ER at 4. \n  \nPlaintiffs also contend that defendants have violated their duties under the federal Nursing Home Reform provisions of the \nMedicaid Act,  42 U.S.C. § 1396r. Through the process of Pre-Admission Screening and Annual Resident Review1, or \n“PASARR,” individuals identified as having a psychiatric disability are evaluated to determine whether they need a nursing \nfacility level of care or whether their needs can be met in the community. Defendants have failed to do any assessments \nwhatsoever for many individuals, have failed to do timely assessments for others, have failed to consider community \nalternatives and have failed to provide necessary services when they were otherwise unavailable. Full implementation of \ndefendants’ PASARR responsibilities is critically significant to persons being considered for placement in SNF/IMDs since it \nwould compel utilization of alternative community services and would do much to close the “revolving door” which sends \nplaintiffs back to locked psychiatric nursing homes when they could remain safely in the community if appropriate services \nwere provided. \n  \nFinally, underlying these claims are plaintiffs’ claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., \nwhich requires defendants to provide services to persons with disabilities in the most integrated setting appropriate to their \nneeds. Here, since plaintiffs could receive state funded mental health services in the community, it is a violation of the ADA \nto provide services instead only in locked psychiatric nursing homes. \n  \nContrary to defendants’ strident claims, this is not a “deinstitutionalization lawsuit.” See Appellants’ Opening Brief \n(hereinafter, “AOB”) at 3: “Plaintiffs allege that State Defendants failed to comply with the Medicaid Act, NHRA and the \nADA, by failing to deinstitutionalize all of California’s Institutes for Mental Disease, . . . .” Plaintiffs did not raise the issues \nof “right to treatment” which were rejected in  Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed. 28 (1982), \nnor did they ever raise a substantive due process claim. Plaintiffs did not seek to shut down IMDs through this action because \nthey recognize that these placements are necessary for some individuals. Nor did plaintiffs seek to compel defendants to \ncreate new programs in the community since the present scope of community-based rehabilitative services in the state \nMedicaid plan will meet their needs. Plaintiffs did seek to force state officials to remove the illegal funding constraints and \nassessment  practices  which  have  limited  the  availability  of  these  programs  and  resulted  in  unnecessary  institutional \nplacement for many in violation of federal law. Plaintiffs moved for class certification on August 2, 1996. Concurrently, \n9 \n \n\n \n \n \nWorth “”Buttercup’’ HALE, Ivo Sutich, Cheryl Ellison,..., 1997 WL 33555335...   \n \n \ndefendants moved to dismiss all of plaintiffs’ claims pursuant to Federal Rule of Procedure 12(b)(6) on numerous grounds, \none of which is at issue in this appeal: that defendants are immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment. \n  \nOn December 2, 1996, District Judge Stanley Weigel issued his decision which denied defendants’ motion to dismiss \npursuant to their Eleventh Amendment immunity defense. Judge Weigel held2 \n  \nThe Eleventh Amendment does not bar Plaintiffs from seeking injunctive relief to prevent State officers from continuing to \nviolate the Medicaid Act, the PASARR provisions of the NHRA, and the ADA. \n  \nDist. Ct. Opinion, ER at 5. This appeal followed. \n  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThis action falls within the well-settled rule that the Eleventh Amendment does not bar actions against state officers in their \nofficial capacities if the plaintiffs seek only a declaratory judgment or injunctive relief. Ex Pane  Young, 209 U.S. 123 \n(1908). Since defendants concede that plaintiffs seek only prospective declaratory and injunctive relief against state officials \nsued in their official capacities, this Court need not even reach the constitutional questions posed by defendants regarding \nCongressional authority to otherwise abrogate state immunity. \n  \nThe Supreme Court has expressly and implicitly recognized the continued viability of the Young rule ( Seminole Tribe of \nFlorida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 116 S.Ct. 1114, 1133 n.14 and n.16 (1996)) and lower courts, in decisions both preceding \nand postdating Seminole, have regularly applied the Young exception to cases, such as this, which challenge state officials’ \nfailure to follow the mandates of federal statutes irrespective of potential ancillary impact of the decision on the state. Indeed, \nsince the adoption of the federal-state program in the Medicaid Act, courts, including California district courts and this Court, \nhave addressed systemic violations of the Medicaid Act by state officials and routinely allowed remedies which result in \nsignificant alterations of state procedures. \n  \nCongress acted pursuant to a valid exercise of its powers under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment in abrogating state \nEleventh Amendment immunity from suit under the ADA. Section 5 gives Congress broad powers to pass appropriate \nlegislation to enforce the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641, \n86  S.Ct.  1717  (1966).  These  sweeping  powers  clearly  support  Congressional  legislation  which  requires  that  states \naffirmatively insure equal treatment for individuals subject to discrimination. Thus the integration mandate of the ADA is \njustified by Congressional findings that disability based discrimination is grounded in the segregation and isolation of \nindividuals with disabilities.  Martin v. Voinovich, 840 F.Supp. 1175 (S.D. Ohio 1993). Helen L. v. DiDario, 46 F.3d \n333 (3d Cir. 1995). \n  \nMuch of the authority relied on by defendants is support of their positions is based on the false premise that this is a \ndeinstitutionalization case and thus must be dismissed as irrelevant. \n  \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nPlaintiffs agree with defendants that the issues raised herein are reviewed de novo. \n  \nARGUMENT \n10 \n \n\n \n \n \nWorth “”Buttercup’’ HALE, Ivo Sutich, Cheryl Ellison,..., 1997 WL 33555335...   \n \n \nI. EX PARTE YOUNG PERMITS THIS SUIT AGAINST STATE OFFICIALS TO REDRESS VIOLATIONS OF \nFEDERAL LAW \nDefendants argue that the district court is without jurisdiction to issue declaratory and injunctive relief to compel state \nofficials to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Medicaid Act, and the Nursing Home Reform Act, citing \nSeminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 116 S.Ct. 1114 (1996). To the contrary, the Eleventh Amendment is no \nbar to this action. Defendants do not dispute that plaintiffs seek only prospective declaratory and injunctive relief against \nstate officials sued in their official capacities. Consequently, since this action falls within the well-settled exception to \nEleventh Amendment immunity set forth in Ex Pane  Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), this Court need not even reach the \nconstitutional questions posed by defendants regarding Congressional authority to otherwise abrogate state immunity. Indeed, \nabrogation is wholly unnecessary for plaintiffs’ suit to proceed on their Medicaid Act claims, since Congress has not \npurported to abrogate state immunity for alleged violations of the Medicaid Act. Cf.  Wilder v. Virginia Hosp. Ass’n, 496 \nU.S. 498, 517 (1990) (Congress passed in 1975 and then repealed in 1976, a provision requiring states to waive any Eleventh \nAmendment immunity from suit for violations of the Medicaid Act).3 \n  \nBecause the Nursing Home Reform Act is one part of the federal Medicaid Act, any immunities or lack thereof that \ndefendants enjoy are synonymous with those under the Medicaid Act. Plaintiffs readily concede that neither the Nursing \nHome Reform Act nor the Medicaid Act of which it is a part are promulgated pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment: both \nare concededly Spending Clause enactments. Compare, AOB at 10-11 (arguing that the Nursing Home Reform Act should be \nconstrued in a manner similar to Titles VI and IX). \n  \nA. Undisturbed by Seminole. Ex Parte Young Allows Plaintiffs To Seek Prospective Injunctive Relief \nIt is well-settled that “[t]he Eleventh Amendment does not bar actions against state officers in their official capacities if the \nplaintiffs seek only a declaratory judgment or injunctive relief.”  Los Angeles Branch NAACP v. Los Angeles Unified Sch. \nDist., 714 F.2d 946, 952 (9th Cir. 1983). This recognized distinction between allowable actions for prospective relief versus \ndisallowed actions for retroactive monetary relief traces its lineage to Ex Parte  Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908). \n  \nIn Young, the Supreme Court upheld an injunction against a state attorney general on the grounds that when a state official \nacts unconstitutionally, he acts ultra vires, “stripped of his official or representative character,” and thus of any immunity the \nstate might have been able to provide. Id. at 160. \n  \nThe rule of Ex Parte Young “gives life to the Supremacy Clause”, by providing a pathway to relief from continuing violations \nof federal law by a state or its officers.  Green v. Mansour, 474 U.S. 64, 69 (1985). As the Court has explained, \n“[r]emedies designed to end a continuing violation of federal law are necessary to vindicate the federal interest in assuring the \nsupremacy of that law.” Id. at 68 (citations omitted). \n  \nIn Seminole, the Court expressly acknowledged that while its holding prohibits certain suits against the state qua state, the \nCourt was not disturbing the “other methods of ensuring the State’s compliance with federal law.” Seminole at 1133 n.14. \nThe Court held that: “an individual can bring suit against a state officer in order to ensure that the officer’s conduct is in \ncompliance with federal law”. Id. (emphasis added). At another point, the Court underscored the fact that “several avenues \nremain open for ensuring state compliance with federal law: an individual may obtain injunctive relief under Ex Parte Young \nto remedy a state officer’s ongoing violation of federal law.” Id. at n.16. Thus, the majority in Seminole took great pains to \nemphasize the narrow scope and implications of its decision in a fashion that makes it unmistakably clear that the Young \ndoctrine remains alive and well. \n  \nLower courts interpreting Seminole have also agreed that it does not modify the Ex Parte Young doctrine. The Fifth Circuit \nlooked at the doctrine in light of the Supreme Court’s pronouncements, concluding: \n11 \n \n\n \n \n \nWorth “”Buttercup’’ HALE, Ivo Sutich, Cheryl Ellison,..., 1997 WL 33555335...   \n \n \nIt is well established that the federal courts have jurisdiction to hear suits against state officials where, as \nhere, the plaintiffs seek only prospective declaratory or injunctive relief to prevent a continuing violation \nof federal law. Our conclusion is unaffected by the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Seminole Tribe. \n  \n  \nCigna Health Plan of Louisiana v. Louisiana, 82 F.3d 642, 644 n.l (1996) (citations omitted). See also Clark v. Mercado, \n1996 WL 328170 at slip. op. p.l and n.l (June 3, 1996, W.D.N.Y.) (“The Eleventh Amendment does not, however, bar suits \nseeking prospective relief against state officials . . . defendants’ reliance on Seminole is wholly misplaced.”);  Leavitt v. \nArave, 927 F.Supp. 394, 396 (D.Idaho 1996) (same). \n  \nThe instant action falls squarely within the doctrine of Ex Pane Young. Plaintiffs have sued state officers in their official \ncapacities, rather than the state itself, seeking only declaratory and injunctive relief. Defendants raise two arguments in \nopposition: that the relief requested really runs against the State and that Ex Parte Young should be limited only to claims of \nfederal constitutional, and not federal statutory, violations. We discuss each argument in turn below. \n  \nB. Ex Parte Young Applies Even If There Is An Ancillary Impact On The State. \nDefendants claim that since this suit is “seeking wide-ranging reforms on the part of the state defendants,” it is really against \nthe state and is thus barred by the Eleventh Amendment. AOB at 14. Since the state itself has already included in its state \nMedicaid plan the community mental health services to which plaintiffs claim an entitlement (ER at 61 - District Ct. Op.), \nordering state officials to make these services available on an equitable, state-wide basis will not be a radical restructuring of \nthe program. While the requested relief may have a subsequent impact on the state treasury, any such impact would be \nancillary to bringing an end to a violation of federal law.  Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 278 (1986). Accord, \nKostok v. Thomas, 105 F.3d 65, 69 (1997) (Eleventh Amendment no bar to Ex Parte Young Medicaid suit for new \nwheelchair, despite ancillary fiscal impact on the state). \n  \nIn fact, no Supreme Court case has ever held that injunctive or declaratory relief against state officers is barred because the \nstate is the real party in interest.4 Quite the contrary, the high court has frequently recognized that Ex parte Young actions are \njustified, “notwithstanding the obvious impact on the state itself.” Pennhurst //, 465 U.S. at 104. “Relief that serves directly \nto bring an end to a present violation of federal law is not barred by the Eleventh Amendment even though accompanied by a \nsubstantial ancillary effect on the state treasury.”  Papasan, 478 U.S. at 278. Accord  Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. \n267, 288-90 (1977) (injunction requiring state officials to eliminate prospectively all vestiges of de jure segregated school \nsystem not barred by Eleventh Amendment, regardless of the impact on the state treasury). \n  \nMoreover, cases such as this one addressing systemic violations of the Medicaid Act necessarily result in statewide reforms. \nCourts have routinely and correctly permitted Medicaid cases to seek and secure injunctive relief under Ex pane Young. This \nhas been true in other California Medicaid cases. Sweeping state-wide reforms were ordered in  Clark v. Kizer, 758 \nF.Supp. 572 (E.D. Cal. 1990) (summary judgment), aff’d and remanded sub nom. Clark v. Coye, 967 F.2d 585 (9th Cir. \n1992), on remand, No. S-87-1700 JFM, Medicare & Medicaid Guide New Dev. ¶ 40,888 (Oct. 14, 1992), reversed on other \ngrounds,  60 F.3d 600 (9th Cir. 1995). There, the court ordered state officials to increase the reimbursement rates for \ndentists and maintain a toll-free number to link Medi-Cal recipients with dentists to address violations of the access and \ncomparability provisions of the Medicaid Act,  42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(10)(A) and  1396a(a)(10)(B). \n  \nValdivia v. Department of Health Services, Case No. S-90-1226 EJG/PAN (Order and Permanent Injunction August 11, \n1992, Stipulated Order April 13, 1993), CCH Medicare & Medicaid Guide ¶ 41,959, addressed California’s failure to comply \nwith the Nursing Home Reform portions of the Medicaid Act by broad orders affecting most aspects of care for persons in \n12 \n \n\n \n \n \nWorth “”Buttercup’’ HALE, Ivo Sutich, Cheryl Ellison,..., 1997 WL 33555335...   \n \n \nnursing facilities including resident assessments, residents’ rights, licensing and certification requirements, standards for \nauthorizing physical and occupational therapy, etc. \n  \nCharpentier v. Belshé addressed the problem of dual-eligibles who received both Medicare and Medicaid and were being \ndenied power and custom wheelchairs in violation of Medicaid’s comparability provision. The district court issued a \nmandatory preliminary injunction barring the state from limiting its payment to 20% of Medicare’s reasonable charge. \nCharpentier, CCH Medicare & Medicaid Guide New Dev. ¶ 38,937 (S-90-758 EJG/PAN, Nov. 20, 1990). This order was \nexpanded to include medical supplies and other equipment, CCH Medicare & Medicaid Guide New Dev. ¶ 39,791 (January \n9, 1992), with the permanent injunction issuing December 21, 1994. New Dev. ¶ 43,123. Compliance with the Charpentier \ninjunctive orders required significant changes in the tape-to-tape billing and payment procedures for Medicare-Medicaid \nclaims and changes in the Medi-Cal procedures to accommodate supplemental payments. \n  \nSobky v. Smoley, 855 F.Supp. 1123 (E.D. Cal. 1994), was another Young action for declaratory and injunctive against \nCalifornia Medicaid officials. As in this case, the plaintiffs in Sobky alleged violations of the statewideness, reasonable \npromptness,  and  comparability  provisions  of  the  Medicaid  Act,  42  U.S.C.  §  1396a(a)(1),  1396a(a)(8),  and \n1396a(a)(10)(B). The district court found that state officials had violated the Medicaid Act in their administration of the \nstate methadone treatment system and ordered statewide system changes to insure Medi-Cal beneficiaries had access to \nmethadone treatment services without a waiting list and without regard to their county of residence. \n  \nIn Sneede v. Kizer, 758 F.Supp. 607 (N.D. Cal. 1990), the court ordered state officials not to attribute income from one \nperson to another except spouse to spouse and parent to child in compliance with the Medicaid provision at  42 U.S.C. §§ \n1396a(a)(17); the implementation required by this order was staggering, requiring the issuance of new manuals and \ndirectives, massive staff trainings, and substantial changes in computer programs. \n  \nSimilarly, Ex Pane Young Medicaid cases against state officials in other jurisdictions also have sought relief which resulted \nin statewide reforms in the Medicaid system.5 \n  \nC. Ex Parte Young Has Never Been. Nor Should It Be. Limited To Constitutional Violations Alone. \nDefendants claim that Ex Pane Young permits a narrow exception to Eleventh Amendment immunity in cases seeking \nprospective injunctive relief against state officials for constitutional violations.” AOB at 4. In an apparent case of wishful \nthinking, defendants assert that “[t]his court believes, and Defendants agree, that extending Ex Parte Young to suits involving \nfederal statutory violations, as alleged here, was a mistake.” AOB at 4. To the contrary, in  Almond Hill School v. U.S. \nDept. of Agriculture, 768 F.2d 1030, 1034 (9th Cir. 1985) and again in Natural Resources Defense Council ( NRDC) v. \nCalifornia Department of Transportation, 96 F.3d 420, 422 (9th Cir. 1996), this Court found no reason to limit Ex Pane \nYoung to constitutional violations alone.6 \n  \nIn fact, counsel have found no case in which the court has ever seriously questioned the applicability of Young to redress \nviolations of federal statutory law. Even in Almond Hill, this Court identified no contrary authority and seemed to regard its \nconclusion as uncontroversial. The three cases which cite this holding in Almond Hill all conclude that Young applies to \nfederal statutory violations and not just to constitutional violations.  NRDC, 96 F.3d 420 (9th Cir. 1996); Atlantic Health \nCare Benefits Trust v. Foster, 809 F.Supp. 365 (M.D.PA. 1992), aff’d, 6 F.3d 778 (3rd Cir. 1993);  Strahan v. Coxe, 939 \nF.Supp. 963 (D. Mass. 1996). \n  \nThe Supreme Court was presented in Seminole itself with the opportunity to limit Ex Pane Young in the manner proposed by \ndefendants. Since Seminole concerned alleged violations of federal statute, rather than constitutional violations, the court \ncould have disposed of the Ex Pane Young issue on this ground, but did not. Similarly,  Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651. \n13 \n \n\n \n \n \nWorth “”Buttercup’’ HALE, Ivo Sutich, Cheryl Ellison,..., 1997 WL 33555335...   \n \n \n664-668 (1974),  Quern v. Jordan, 440 U.S. 332, 342, 99 S.Ct. 1139, 1146, 59 L.Ed. 358 (1979) and Green v. Mansour \n424 U.S. at 69, were all Ex Pane Young suits against state officials to enforce provisions of the Social Security Act. In all \nthree, the Supreme Court did not characterize this as an “extension” of Ex Pane Young; rather, it concluded this exception to \nstate immunity was central to the balance of federalism. \n  \nDefendants seem to suggest that Almond Hill was an aberration - an “extension” of Ex Pane Young to novel and controversial \nrealms. AOB at 15-16. In fact, every significant, reported Medicaid suit in the history of this major federal-state program has \nbeen an Ex Pane Young action against state officials for violation of the federal Medicaid statute, the most significant perhaps \nbeing  Wilder v. Va. Hospital Association, 496 U.S. 498, 110 S.Ct. 2510-(1990). Wilder was a Section 1983 action against \n“several state officials, including the Governor,” in which plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief for violations of \nthe Boren Amendment to the Medicaid Act.  110 S.Ct at 2514.7 \n  \nEvery court which has considered Eleventh Amendment immunity defenses post -Seminole has permitted an Ex Parte Young \naction involving statutory Medicaid claims against state officials: Maryland Psychiatric Society, Inc. v. Wasserman, 1996 \nWL 71882 n.1 (4th Cir., Dec. 16, 1996)Maryland Psychiatric Society, Inc. v. Wasserman, 1996 WL 71882 n.1 (4th Cir., Dec. \n16, 1996) (court has jurisdiction to hear claims against state officials for violation of the federal Medicaid Act, despite \nSeminole);  Daniels v. Wadley, 926 F.Supp. 1305, 1310 (M.D. Tenn. 1996) (Seminole “poses no barrier to Medicaid suit \nunder Ex Parte Young”);  Hunter v. Chiles, 944 F.Supp. 914, 917 (S.D.Fla. 1996) (permitting Medicaid claims against \nstate officials under Ex Parte Young because “the relevant law in this area is unchanged” despite Seminole).8 \n  \nPre-Seminole Medicaid cases are equally consistent in permitting Young actions for prospective relief against state officials \nfor violations of the Medicaid Act. See, e.g.,  Kimble v. Solomon, 599 F.2d 599, 601 (4th Cir. 1979) (state officials \nreduced Medicaid benefits without complying with federal notice requirements in Medicaid statute; while retroactive relief \nwas barred by Eleventh Amendment, prospective relief was permitted); Granato v. Bane, 74 F.3d 406, 410-413 (2nd Cir. \n1996) (state agency violates Medicaid statute requiring notices of action and aid paid pending the hearing; damages barred by \nthe Eleventh Amendment but court ordered prospective relief on statutory claims);  Rehabilitation Ass’n of Va. v. \nKozlowski, 42 F.3d 1444, 1449 (4th Cir. 1994) (suit against state Medicaid director is not barred by Eleventh Amendment \nbecause of Young and Edelman);  New York City Health and Hospitals v. Perales, 954 F.2d 854 (2nd Cir. 1992) (where \nprovider reimbursement scheme violated federal Medicaid statute, Eleventh Amendment is no bar to prospective relief). \n  \nD. The Historical Development of the Ex Parte Young Doctrine Demonstrates Its Continued Viability. \nDefendants argue without reference or supporting citation that “extending Ex Parte Young to suits involving alleged \nviolations of federal statutory rights frustrates the very reasons which led to the passage of the Eleventh Amendment, without \nsubstantially furthering the supremacy of the federal law.” AOB at 4-5. Accord AOB at 16. \n  \nDefendants refer to the “historically sound principle” that “the Eleventh Amendment prevents Congressional authorization of \nsuits by private parties against unconsenting states.” AOB at 8, quoting  Seminole, 116 S.Ct. at 1131-32. In fact, historical \nevidence is to the contrary. The rule we speak of under the name of Ex Parte Young has been recognized since the Middle \nAges. Numerous commentators agree that it has been settled doctrine that a suit against an officer of the Crown permitted \nrelief against the government despite the sovereign’s immunity from suit in its own courts and the maxim that the King can \ndo no wrong. Jaffe, Suits against Governments and Officers: Sovereign Immunity, 77 Harv. L.Rev., at 3, 18-19. Thus the \nearly English writs of disseisin and of attaint and later writs of certiorari and mandamus permitted actions against the “King’s \nman” even when the Sovereign himself was immune. Jaffe at 9, 16. As Jaffe notes in his commentary, the passage of the \nEleventh Amendment in 1798 \nmight conceivably have been taken so to extend the doctrine as to exclude suits against state officers even \n14 \n \n\n \n \n \nWorth “”Buttercup’’ HALE, Ivo Sutich, Cheryl Ellison,..., 1997 WL 33555335...   \n \n \nin cases where the English tradition would have allowed them. There was a running battle as to where the \nline  would  be  drawn.  The  [Eleventh]  Amendment  was  appealed  to  as  an  argument  for  generous \nimmunity. But there was the vastly powerful counterpressure for the enforcement of constitutional limits \non the states. \n  \n  \nId. at 20-21. There began a series of cases permitting the English practice of permitting suits against officers, culminating in \nYoung itself. Orth, Judicial Power of the United States, at 34-35, 40-41, 122. Young struck the time-honored balance: state \nofficers never have authority to violate the Constitution or federal law, so any illegal action is stripped of state character and \nrendered an illegal individual act, since “[t]he State has no power to impart to him any immunity from responsibility to the \nsupreme authority of the United States.” Ex Pane  Young, 209 U.S., at 159-160, 28 S.Ct., at 453-454. \n  \nIn sum, “the doctrine of Ex Pane Young seems indispensable to the establishment of constitutional government and the rule \nof law.”  Perez v. Ledesma, 401 U.S. 94, 110 91 S.Ct. 674, 690 (1971) (Brennan, concurring in part and dissenting in part, \nquoting C. Wright, Handbook of the Law of Federal Courts, 292 (2nd ed. 1970). See also E. Chermerinsky, Federal \nJurisdiction 393 (2d ed. 1994). \n  \nGiven that Ex Pane Young represents a rule of such weight and longevity, it is the radical restriction of its scope, rather than \nits continued enforcement, that would upset federal/state relations. As the high court has repeatedly taught, such a change \nshould come only with an extraordinarily “clear statement” before assuming a Congressional purpose to affect the federal \nbalance. \n[I]f Congress intends to alter the “usual constitutional balance between the States and the Federal Government,” it must make \nits intention to do so “unmistakably clear in the language of the statute.” \n  \n  \nWill v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 65, 109 S.Ct. 2395, 2400-2402, 115 L.Ed2d 410 (1991), quoting \nAtascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. at 242, 105 S.Ct. at 3147. \n  \nII. THE ABROGATION OF ELEVENTH AMENDMENT IMMUNITY CONTAINED IN THE AMERICANS WITH \nDISABILITIES ACT IS A VALID EXERCISE OF CONGRESS’ POWER UNDER SECTION FIVE OF THE \nFOURTEENTH AMENDMENT. \nFollowing the Supreme Court’s decision in Seminole Tribe, this Court concluded that the abrogation of state Eleventh \nAmendment immunity from suits under the ADA was a proper exercise of Congress’ enforcement power under the \nFourteenth Amendment.  Duffy v. Riveland, 98 F.3d 447, 452 (9th Cir. 1996). Every other court which has considered this \nissue following Seminole has reached the identical conclusion.  Hunter v. Chiles, supra, 944 F.Supp. at 917 (ADA and the \nMedicaid program);  Mayer v. University of Minnesota, 940 F.Supp. 1474, 1480 (D.Minn. 1996) (ADA and state \nuniversity employment);  Niece v. Fitzner, 941 F.Supp. 1497, 1504 (E.D. Mich. 1996) (ADA and prison telephone \ncommunications). See also,  Martin v. Voinovich, 840 F.Supp. 1175, 1186-87 (S.D. Ohio 1993) (pre-Seminole decision \nthat Congress had authority for ADA abrogation under Fourteenth Amendment). \n  \nDefendants concede, as they must, that Congress expressly abrogated Eleventh Amendment immunity with enactment of the \nADA ( 42 U.S.C. § 12202 (express abrogation), 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(4) (constitutional authority)), but nevertheless \ncontend “that Congress did not act pursuant to a valid exercise of power since it did not act pursuant to the Fourteenth \nAmendment.” AOB at 8. Thus, this Court’s inquiry is limited to whether Congress had authority under the Fourteenth \nAmendment to enact the ADA. \n15 \n \n\n \n \n \nWorth “”Buttercup’’ HALE, Ivo Sutich, Cheryl Ellison,..., 1997 WL 33555335...   \n \n \n  \nA. Congress Has the Broadest of Plenary Powers to Adopt Statutes To Enforce The Fourteenth Amendment \nThe Civil War amendments, including the Fourteenth Amendment, “were specifically designed as an expansion of federal \npower and an intrusion on state sovereignty.”  City of Rome v. United States, 446 U.S. 156, 179, 100 S.Ct. 1548, 1563 \n(1980) decided April 22, 1980. The Fourteenth Amendment itself directly confers upon Congress expansive powers: \n“Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.” U.S. Const, amend. XIV, § \n5. \n  \nWhen the Supreme Court first considered the meaning of Section 5 in Ex Parte  Virginia, 100 U.S. 339 (10 Otto) (1879), \nit upheld the constitutionality of a statute enacted by Congress prohibiting disqualification of jurors based on race. In so \nholding, the court broadly defined the power granted Congress by Section 5: \nWhatever legislation is appropriate, that is, adapted to carry out the objects the amendments have in view, \nwhatever tends to enforce submission to the prohibitions they contain, and to secure to all persons the \nenjoyment of perfect equality of civil rights and the equal protection of the laws against State denial or \ninvasion, if not prohibited, is brought within the domain of congressional power. \n  \n  \nId. at 345-46. \n  \nIn  Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641, 86 S.Ct. 1717 (1966), the Supreme Court upheld a Congressional enactment \nprohibiting literacy tests under the Voting Rights Act of 1965,  42 U.S.C. § 1973b(e). The Supreme Court rejected an \nargument that under Section 5 Congress could only prohibit acts that would violate the substantive provisions of the \nFourteenth Amendment. “Correctly viewed, § 5 is a positive grant of legislative power authorizing Congress to exercise its \ndiscretion in determining whether and what legislation is needed to secure the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment.” \n384 U.S. at 651, 86 S.Ct. at 1723-1724. \n  \nMore recently, in  Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445, 96 S.Ct. 2666 (1976), the Supreme Court upheld another \nCongressional abrogation of state immunity, again based on Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. The abrogation \npermitted employment discrimination suits brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,  42 U.S.C. § \n2000e-2(a). The high court noted that “the Eleventh Amendment, and the principle of state sovereignty that it embodies, are \nnecessarily limited by the enforcement provisions of § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.”  Fitzpatrick, 427 U.S. at 456, 96 \nS.Ct. at 2671. \nWhen Congress acts pursuant to § 5, not only is it exercising legislative authority that is plenary within \nthe terms of the constitutional grant, it is exercising that authority under one section of a constitutional \nAmendment whose other sections by their own terms embody limitations on state authority. We think \nthat Congress may, in determining what is “appropriate legislation” for purposes of enforcing the \nprovisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, provide for private suits against States or state officials “which \nare constitutionally impermissible in other contexts.” \n  \n  \n16 \n \n\n \n \n \nWorth “”Buttercup’’ HALE, Ivo Sutich, Cheryl Ellison,..., 1997 WL 33555335...   \n \n \nId. (citation omitted)(footnote omitted)(emphasis added). Accord  Schmidt v. Oakland Unified Sch. Dist., 662 F.2d 550, \n557 n.8 (9th Cir. 1981) (under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, “Congress is not limited to prohibiting activities \nwhich would be held by the courts to violate the Fourteenth Amendment”). \n  \nIn  the  course  of  judicial  review  of  Congress’  authority  in  this  area,  “great  deference  is  to  be  accorded  Congress’ \ndetermination of what measures are appropriate” in exercising its enforcement powers under Section 5 of the Fourteenth \nAmendment.  Bond v. Stanton, 555 F.2d 172, 175 (7th Cir. 1977). According to the high court in Katzenbach, “[i]t was for \nCongress, as the branch that made th[e] judgment, to assess and weigh the various conflicting considerations ... It is not for us \nto review the congressional resolution of these factors. It is enough that we be able to perceive a basis upon which Congress \nmight resolve the conflict as it did.”  384 U.S. at 653, 86 S.Ct. at 1725. \n  \nConsistent with this principle, post-Seminole cases have upheld Congressional abrogation provisions in statutes other than the \nADA, based on the Fourteenth Amendment.  Mockaitis v. Harcleroad, 104 F.3d 1522 (9th Cir. 1997) (Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act); Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents, 1996 U.S. Dist. Lexis 7995 (N.D. Fla. May 17, 1996), appeal pending, \nNo. 96-2788 (11th Cir.) (Age Discrimination in Employment Act); Teichgraeber v. Memorial Union Corp., 946 F.Supp. 900 \n(D.Kan. 1996) (Age Discrimination in Employment Act);  Timmer v. Michigan Dep’t of Commerce, 104 F.3d 833 (6th \nCir. 1997) (Equal Pay Act);  Weaver v. Clarke, 933 F.Supp. 831 (D. Neb. 1996) (Civil Rights Attorney’s Fees Awards \nAct). \n  \nB. The ADA is Appropriate Legislation to Enforce The Fourteenth Amendment. \nIn Katzenbach, the Supreme Court explained that a Congressional enactment is authorized by the Fourteenth Amendment if it \n“may be regarded as an enactment to enforce the Equal Protection Clause, ... is ‘plainly adapted to that end’ and ... is not \nprohibited by but is consistent with the ‘letter and spirit of the constitution.”’  384 U.S. at 651, 86 S.Ct. at 1724 (citations \nomitted). \n  \nAs legislation with an anti-discrimination focus, the ADA meets the Katzenbach test. In enacting the ADA Congress \nexpressly invoked “the sweep of congressional authority, including the power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment and to \nregulate commerce, in order to address the major areas of discrimination faced day-to-day by people with disabilities.” 42 \nU.S.C. § 12101(b)(4). See also 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(1) (purpose of the ADA is “the elimination of discrimination against \npeople with disabilities”). Congressional findings in the ADA expressly reference problems of disability-based discrimination \nand segregation. 42 U.S.C. 12101(a)(2). Pursuant to Circuit Rule 28-2.7, plaintiffs have included relevant text of the ADA, \nwhich includes these findings, in an Addendum to this brief. \n  \nCongress itself characterized the ADA as “civil rights” legislation, harkening to its Fourteenth Amendment roots. S.Rep. No. \n116, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 19 (1989) (proposing “omnibus civil rights legislation” for people with disabilities); H.R.Rep. No. \n485 (II), 101st Cong., 2nd Sess. 40 (1990) (ADA “will finally set in place the necessary civil rights protections for people \nwith disabilities”). \n  \nIn addition, the courts have consistently concluded that the ADA, as well as Section 504 on which it was based, have the \npurpose of furthering “the traditional Equal Protection goal of protecting a discrete class of individuals from arbitrary and \ncapricious action.” EEOC v. Calumet County, 686 F.2d 1249, 1252 (7th Cir. 1982).9 \n  \nAccordingly, the ADA is a valid exercise of Congress’ power to “enforce, by appropriate legislation,” the Fourteenth \nAmendment’s guarantee of equal protection. \n  \nC. Defendants’ Arguments Against Congressional Abrogation Authority Are Unavailing. \n17 \n \n\n \n \n \nWorth “”Buttercup’’ HALE, Ivo Sutich, Cheryl Ellison,..., 1997 WL 33555335...   \n \n \nDefendants make two arguments that Congress exceeded its authority under the Fourteenth Amendment in enacting the \nADA. First, they argue that the ADA is outside the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment because it imposes affirmative \nobligations and not merely equal treatment. AOB at 12. Second, defendants argue that this is really a “deinstitutionalization” \ncase as in Youngberg v. Romeo and its progeny, and that because the Supreme Court held in Youngberg that there is no \nconstitutional due process right to community treatment, integration mandates in the ADA are also outside the constitutional \nauthority of the Fourteenth Amendment. AOB at 12-13. Both arguments are wrong. \n  \n1. Affirmative Obligations Under The ADA Are Consistent With Congress’ Broad Powers Under Section 5 Of The \nFourteenth Amendment. \nDefendants simplisticly focus on equal treatment as the sole remedy under the Fourteenth Amendment. AOB at 12. But the \nhigh court has never limited the remedial reach of the Equal Protection Clause to equal treatment alone.10 To the contrary, in \ndecisions concerning access to the courts by indigent people, the Supreme Court teaches that the Equal Protection Clause is \nsometimes violated by treating unlike persons alike. See, e.g.,  Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 76 S.Ct. at 585 (1956); \nM.L.B. v. S.L.J., 519 U.S. 102, 117 S.Ct. 555 (1996). In these cases, in which the states treated indigent parties appealing \nfrom certain court proceedings as if they were not indigent, the Supreme Court noted that “a law nondiscriminatory on its \nface may be grossly discriminatory in its operation.”  117 S.Ct. at 569, quoting  Griffin, 351 U.S. at 17 n. 11, 76 S.Ct. \nat 590 n.11. Consequently, the Equal Protection Clause required that states affirmatively modify their policies to waive \nappellate fees in order to ensure equal “access” to appeal for indigent persons. Id. at 560. \n  \nMoreover, “[h]ere we deal, . . . not with the limited remedial powers of a federal court, for example, but with the broad \nremedial powers of Congress. It is a fundamental that in no organ of government, state or federal, does there repose a more \ncomprehensive remedial power than in the Congress.”  Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448, 483, 100 S.Ct. 2758, 2777 \n(1980). In Fullilove, the Supreme Court affirmed Congress’ authority under the Fourteenth Amendment to enact the \n“minority business enterprise” provision of the Public Works Employment Act of 1977, 42 U.S.C. § 6705(f)(2): \nCongress may not only induce voluntary action to assure compliance with existing federal statutory or \nconstitutional antidiscrimination provisions, but also, where Congress has the authority to declare certain \nconduct unlawful, it may, as here, authorize and induce action to avoid such conduct. \n  \n  \nId. at 483-484,  100 S.Ct. at 2777. See also Schmidt v. Oakland Unified Sch. Dist. 662, F.2d 550, 557 n.8 (9th Cir. 1981). \n  \nInstead of heeding the teachings of the Supreme Court itself, defendants base their interpretation of the scope of the \nFourteenth Amendment exclusively on dicta from a single district court case from the Eastern District of North Carolina. \nPierce v. King, 918 F.Supp. 932 (E.D.N.C. 1996); AOB at 12. Pierce was a prison employment case which involved facts \nand issues far afield from those in the instant case. The Pierce court concluded that the plaintiff inmate had no standing under \nthe ADA to request accommodation because there was no covered employment relation.  Pierce, 918 F. Supp. at 942. The \nPierce court’s discussion of the Fourteenth Amendment and the ADA occurred in the course of its standing discussion and \nwas not necessary to its ruling. \n  \nAt the same time that defendants rely solely on dicta in Pierce, they fail to inform this Court of an ADA case which is \ndirectly on point both factually and legally.  Martin v. Voinovich, 840 F.Supp. 1175 (S.D. Ohio 1993). Like this case, \nMartin was brought on behalf of persons with disabilities who were forced to remain in institutions and nursing homes, even \nthough they were eligible for community placements. While the state had community placement programs, they were not \n18 \n \n\n \n \n \nWorth “”Buttercup’’ HALE, Ivo Sutich, Cheryl Ellison,..., 1997 WL 33555335...   \n \n \nadequately funded, so that there were no openings for the Martin plaintiffs. As in this case, the Martin plaintiffs asserted \nviolations of the ADA, as well as the Nursing Home Reform Act provisions of the federal Medicaid Act. Although \npre-Seminole, Martin specifically considered whether Congress had constitutional authority to abrogate the state defendant’s \nEleventh Amendment immunity under the ADA. Citing Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, the Martin court concluded that the Fourteenth \nAmendment affords such authority. Id. at 1186-87. \n  \nHelen L. v. DiDario, 46 F.3d 325 (3d Cir. 1995) is another ADA case which, along with Martin, demonstrates the \nnecessity for the affirmative remedies for disability-based discrimination which Congress fashioned in the ADA. In Helen L., \nthe plaintiffs lived in nursing facilities where they had no contact with members of the community and were segregated away \nfrom non-disabled persons. The plaintiffs sought to participate in the state’s existing program of home attendant care, for \nwhich they were qualified and which would have enabled them to return to live with their families and friends in the \ncommunity. Scarce funding from the state created arbitrary limits on the numbers of persons who could participate in the \nattendant care program, resulting in a waiting list for these limited community services just as limited funding in California \nhas resulted in the de facto waiting lists for rehabilitative mental health services in the community which are at issue in the \ninstant case. \n  \nTo support their claim for community based services, the plaintiffs in Helen L. relied on the “integration mandate” in the \nADA. The ADA provides that “no qualified person with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from \nparticipation in or be denied the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity.”  42 U.S.C. §12132. In addition, public entities must make “reasonable modifications to rules, policies, or \npractices” for a “qualified individual with a disability.” 42 U.S.C. 12131(2). The implementing regulations are even more \nspecific, requiring that “[a] public entity shall administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting \nappropriate to the individual needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d). \n  \nThe Third Circuit carefully considered the purpose of the ADA in its review of the justification for plaintiffs’ claim of a right \nto services “in the most integrated setting appropriate.”  Helen L., 46 F.3d at 332-333. \nIn enacting the ADA, Congress found that “[h]istorically, society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with \ndisabilities and ...such forms of discrimination ... continue to be a serious and pervasive problem.” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(2) \n(emphasis added). Congress also concluded that “[individuals with disabilities continually encounter various forms of \ndiscrimination, including ... segregation ....”, 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(5) (emphasis added). \n  \n  \nId. at 332. “Thus, the ADA and its attendant regulations clearly define unnecessary segregation as a form of illegal \ndiscrimination against the disabled.” Id. at 333. See also Cook, “The Americans with Disabilities Act: The Move to \nIntegration,” 64 Temp. L. Rev. 393, 409-410. \n  \nCongress’ concerns in fashioning the ADA fall squarely within the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment, since it is \nwell-recognized that segregation and isolation are forms of discrimination prohibited under the Equal Protection Clause. For \nexample, in  Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), the Supreme Court found that state-supported school \nsegregation may affect children’s “hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone”, and that “[s]eparate . . . facilities \nare inherently equal.” Id. at 494-495. \n  \nSince integration is the most effective remedy for this form of discrimination, the Justice Department’s commentary on the \nADA regulations explains that “[i]ntegration is fundamental to the purposes of the Americans with Disabilities Act.” 28 \nC.F.R. Part 35, App. A  Sec. 35.130. \n  \nIn summary, Congress’ broad authority under the Fourteenth Amendment includes “the power to define situations which \nCongress determines threaten principles of equality and to adopt prophylactic rules to deal with those situations.”  City of \nRichmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 490, 109 S.Ct. 706 (1989) (emphasis in original), citing Katzenbach v. Morgan, \n384 U.S. 651. The integration mandate in the ADA construed in Martin v. Voinovich and Helen L. is just such a “prophylactic \n19 \n \n\n \n \n \nWorth “”Buttercup’’ HALE, Ivo Sutich, Cheryl Ellison,..., 1997 WL 33555335...   \n \n \nrule” which deals with the problems of discriminatory segregation and isolation faced by persons with disabilities and is \nsquarely within Congress’ authority under the Equal Protection Clause. \n  \n2. This Is Not A Deinstitutionalization Case And Is Not Controlled By Youngberg V. Romeo. \nDefendants mischaracterize this as a “deinstitutionalization” case, attempting to bring it within the ambit of  Youngberg v. \nRomeo, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452 (1982) and its progeny.11 The Youngberg line of due process cases, all of which were \ndecided prior to the enactment of the ADA, are irrelevant to Congress’ broad authority to enforce the Equal Protection Clause \nof the Fourteenth Amendment. \n  \nIn Youngberg, the Supreme Court ruled that the plaintiff was only entitled to minimally adequate treatment under the due \nprocess clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  457 U.S. at 322. Here, plaintiffs have alleged no constitutional due process \nclaim. First Amended Complaint, ER at 1-41. Instead, they have alleged claims under the ADA, legislation in which \nCongress was able to exercise its broader remedial power. Thus, Congress was able to fashion remedies -- the right to \nservices in the most integrated community setting appropriate -- which the courts alone may not have been able to impose as \na judicial remedy directly under the Constitution. See. e.g.,  Fullilove, 448 U.S. at 483-484. \n  \nIt is also important to note that the “integration mandate” of the ADA does not require the creation of entirely new \ncommunity based programs, one of the remedies sought and rejected in Youngberg. As the Third Circuit makes clear in \nHelen L., “’deinstitutionalization’ involves ‘massive’ changes in a state’s programs and is not required absent a clear \nstatutory command.”  Helen L., 46 F.3d at 336 n. 22 (citing  Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Haldeman, 451 \nU.S. 1, 24, 101 S.Ct. 1531, 1543 (1981)). The state defendants in Helen L., like the defendant here, attempted to defeat the \nplaintiff’s claim “by labeling it a claim for ‘community care’ or ‘deinstitutionalization’ --something which the ADA does not \nrequire.”  Helen L., 46 F.3d at 336 (citations and footnote omitted.) The court was unimpressed: \n[Plaintiff] Idell S. is not asserting a right to community care or deinstitutionalization per se. She properly \nconcedes that [defendant] DPW is under no obligation to provide her with any care at all. She is merely \nclaiming that, since she qualifies for DPW’s attendant care program, DPW’s failure to provide those \nservices in the “most integrated setting appropriate” to her needs (without a proper justification) violates \nthe ADA. \n  \n  \nId. \n  \nMartin  v.  Voinovich  is  also  helpful  in  de-constructing  defendants’  contention  that  the  instant  case  is  merely  a \n“deinstitutionalization” case barred by Youngberg. With factual allegations very similar to those in the instant case, the \nMartin plaintiffs also asserted a due process claim based on Youngberg. Martin, F.Supp. at 1207. Not surprisingly, the Martin \ncourt ruled that since “Youngberg does not give rise to a right to residential placement,” plaintiffs had not stated a Youngberg \nclaim based on “allegations such as defendants have failed to provide residential services or remove persons from institutions \nto community living arrangements.” Id.12 Significantly, the Martin court simultaneously recognized that these identical facts \ndid give rise to a valid claim under the ADA and the Nursing Home Reform Act provisions of the Medicaid Act. Id. at 1142, \n1197 - 1202. \n  \n3. Title II of the ADA is consistent with Congress’ Broad Powers under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment \n20 \n \n\n \n \n \nWorth “”Buttercup’’ HALE, Ivo Sutich, Cheryl Ellison,..., 1997 WL 33555335...   \n \n \nNoting that Congress identified the Commerce Clause as well as the Fourteenth Amendment as its authority for the ADA, \ndefendants argue that plaintiffs have not alleged any ADA obligations under the Fourteenth Amendment. AOB at 11, In \nenacting the ADA, Congress invoked its powers under the Commerce Clause because it wished to reach the conduct of \nprivate parties. 42 U.S.C. 12101(b)(4). The Fourteenth Amendment, rather than the Commerce Clause, is the traditional \nconstitutional authority for prescribing state conduct. EEOC v. County of Calumet, 686 F.2d at 1253. Since it is plain that this \naction is brought pursuant to Title II of the ADA against public rather than private entities, the obligations of the ADA which \nplaintiffs seek to enforce are obviously traced to the Fourteenth Amendment rather than the Commerce Clause. Congress’ \nauthority to reach private entities through its authority to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment need not be decided here. \n  \nCONCLUSION \nThe district court’s judgment should be affirmed. \n  \nAppendix not available. \nFootnotes \n \n1  With the passage of the Medicaid Nursing Homes Annual Resident Review Act of 1996, Congress eliminated the annual Resident \n  Review portion of PASARR. \n \n2  The district court did not rule on plaintiffs’ motion for class certification and all proceedings in this case have been stayed by order \n  of the district court pending the resolution of this appeal. \n \n3 \nThe state has continued to accept federal Medicaid funds following enactment of  42 U.S.C. § 2000d-7. That section was \n \nenacted  pursuant  to  Congress’  Fourteenth  Amendment  authority  to  abrogate  states’  Eleventh  Amendment  immunity  by \n“manifesting a clear intent to condition participation in the programs funded under the Act on a State’s consent to waive its \nconstitutional immunity.”  Atascadero State Hosp. v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 247 (1985). As analyzed at pages 40-42 of the \nDepartment of Justice’s amicus brief in Armstrong, continued acceptance of federal Medicaid funds following the enactment of \n§ 2000d-7 constitutes a consent to be sued and a waiver of immunity with respect to claims that can be brought under  § \n2000d-7. While this action was not brought under Section 504 but under the broader sweep of the Americans with Disabilities Act, \nto the extent Section 504 and ADA claims are congruent, the state has waived its immunity and consented to suit. \n \n4 \nDefendants cite only one case -  Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 687 (1949) - in their support.

Rubin, 80 F.3d 1338, 1339-50 (9th Cir. 1996) for the proposition that there is no express abrogation of state \nimmunity in the Medicaid Act. AOB at 9. This is a non-sequitur which plaintiffs have never disputed, a fact which the district court \nitself noted. Opinion, ER at 51. \nGamboa is wholly irrelevant, as it concerns the Eleventh amendment bar on raising state law claims against state defendants in \nfederal court.  80 F.3d at 1350. More to the point, Amisub only lends additional support for plaintiffs’ Young claims. In Amisub, \nthe state Medicaid agency was dismissed on Eleventh Amendment grounds but the case proceeded against the state Medicaid \ndirector based on Ex Parte Young. Id. at 793 n.7. The Amisub court then ruled for plaintiffs, finding multiple violations of the \nMedicaid Act and ordering the state director to comply with federal law. Amisub was one of the many circuit court cases that led to \nthe court’s decision in Wilder. See,  Wilder v. Va. Hospital Assoc., 110 S.Ct. at 2522 n. 16. \n \n8  In the district court, defendants raised a third argument, now apparently abandoned on appeal: that the remedial schemes of the \n  ADA and the Medicaid Act evince Congressional intent to preclude private enforcement through an Ex Pane Young action. This \nargument was considered and rejected by the district court in its opinion. ER at 52 - 54. It has also been considered and rejected in \nthe post-Seminole Medicaid cases cited in the text above. \n \n9  See Armstrong, Brief of the United States at 34-39; Armstrong, Brief of Appellees at 24-28 for a discussion of additional cases \n  regarding the Fourteenth Amendment as the authority for § 504 and the ADA. \n \n10  See Armstrong, Brief of the United States, 22-32; Armstrong, Brief of Appellees, 34-38 for further analysis of Congress’ powers to \n  prohibit intentional discrimination and disparate impact. \nIn their reply brief defendants may argue that Congress lacks the power to impose affirmative obligations to remedy discrimination \nagainst people with disabilities because the Supreme Court has not recognized disability as a suspect class. However, it is in \ndispute that people with disabilities are protected under the Fourteenth Amendment. See  City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living \nCenter, 473 U.S. 432, 105 S.Ct. (1985) (striking down discriminatory zoning ordinance). Additionally, “[t]he fact that the Supreme \nCourt has subjected governmental classifications involving suspect classes to a higher level of scrutiny than other classifications \ndoes not prevent Congress from finding that another class of persons has been subjected to a history of unequal treatment and \nlegislating pursuant to its enforcement powers of the Fourteenth Amendment to protect that class of persons from arbitrary \ndiscrimination.”  Mayer, 940 Fed. Supp. at 1479. See Clark, Brief of the United States at 8-14; Armstrong, Brief of the United \nStates at 14-20; Armstrong, Brief of Appellees at 29-34 for analysis of this issue. \n \n11 \nDefendants also cite  Society for Good Will to Retarded Children v.

(“ADA”) and 38 C.F.R. § 35.130. Plaintiffs have pleaded that jurisdiction of the \ndistrict court was conferred pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343. Plaintiffs filed Proofs of Service as of June 28, 1996. \n(CD 90.)1 On August 6, 1996, Defendants/Appellants (referred to as “State Defendants”) filed a Motion to Dismiss and to \nDisqualify Counsel on August 6, 1996. This appeal is from the district court’s December 2, 1996, Order Granting in Part \nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss ( Fed.R.Civ.Proc. 12(b)(6)) and Denying Defendants’ Motion to Disqualify Counsel. (CD \n93; ER 42-81.) The district court denied the Eleventh Amendment immunity defense raised by State Defendants on all three \ntypes of claims, the Medicaid Act, NHRA, and ADA. Within ten days from that date, on December 12, 1996, State \nDefendants filed their notice of appeal, stating that Defendants were appealing the December 2, 1996 Order on Eleventh \nAmendment immunity grounds pertaining to all claims raised. (CD 93; ER 82-85.) \n  \nThis court has jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine of Defendants’/Appellants’ appeal from the district court’s \norder denying Defendants’ motion to dismiss on the grounds that Plaintiffs’ claims are barred by the Eleventh Amendment. \nPuerto Rico Aqueduct & Sewer Authority v. Metcalf & Eddy, 506 U.S. 139, 142-45 (1993).2 \n  \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nPlaintiffs’ complaint seeks to pursue a class action suit on behalf of “all persons who are, have been or will be placed in \n[Skilled  Nursing  Facilities/Institutions  for  Mental  Disease]  SNF/IMDs  because  rehabilitative  mental  health  services \nappropriate to their individual needs are unavailable as a result of funding limitations” (ER 7, First Amended Complaint, p.5.) \nState Defendants are the Director of the California Department of Health Services, the Director of the California Department \nof Mental Health, and the Treasurer and Controller of the State of California. All Defendants are sued in their official \ncapacities. \n  \nIn bringing this suit, Plaintiffs allege that State Defendants failed to comply with the Medicaid Act, NHRA, and ADA, by \nfailing to deinstitutionalize all of California’s Institutes for Mental Disease, and providing services to these individuals in \ncommunity placements. Plaintiffs seek wide-ranging and extraordinarily intrusive injunctive and declaratory relief. \n  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nState defendants are immune from suit under the recent United States Supreme Court decision in  Seminole Tribe of \nFlorida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 116 S.Ct. 1114 (1996). Since the Seminole Tribe decision provides Eleventh Amendment \nimmunity where the legislative enactment was promulgated under a constitutional provision other than the Fourteenth \nAmendment, Plaintiffs’ claims under the Medicaid Act and Nursing Home Reform Act cannot survive. This is because these \nActs were promulgated under the Spending Clause. Regarding Plaintiffs’ claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act \n(ADA), the Defendants are immune from suit since under the Fourteenth Amendment Congress lacked authority to enact the \nADA. Ex Parte  Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908) which is referenced in Seminole Tribe, permits a narrow exception to \nEleventh Amendment immunity in cases seeking prospective injunctive relief against state officials for constitutional \nviolations. This Court believes, and State Defendants agree, that extending Ex Parte Young to suits involving federal \nstatutory violations, as alleged here, was a mistake. Extending Ex Pane Young to suits involving alleged violations of federal \nstatutory rights frustrates the very reasons which led to passage of the Eleventh Amendment, without substantially furthering \nthe supremacy of the federal law. The Supreme Court has taken this issue for review and will provide additional guidance \nduring this term. \n  \n5 \n \n\n \n \n \nWorth “”Buttercup’’ HALE, et al., Plaintiffs-Appellees, v...., 1997 WL 33555336...   \n \n \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nThe district court’s determinations regarding Eleventh Amendment immunity are reviewed de novo.  BV Engineering v. \nUniv. of Cal., Los Angeles, 858 F.2d 1394, 1395 (9th Cir. 1988). The court reviews the district court’s order on defendants’ \nmotion to dismiss de novo.  Gibson v. United States, 781 F.2d 1334, 1337 (9th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1054 \n(1987). \n  \nARGUMENT \nI. \nSTATE DEFENDANTS ARE IMMUNE FROM SUIT UNDER THE RECENT SEMINOLE TRIBE DECISION \n  \nUnder the Eleventh Amendment,3 states are immune from suit in federal court.  Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1 (1890). In \nSeminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 116 S.Ct. 1114 (1996), the Supreme Court set forth the definitive test \nfor determining a state’s immunity from liability under the Eleventh Amendment. Indeed, the Court stated that even where a \nplaintiff requests only prospective injunctive relief rather than monetary relief, the Eleventh Amendment bars relief. Id. at \n1124. The Court could not have made this point more clear: \n  \nBut we have often made it clear that the relief sought by plaintiff suing a State is irrelevant to the question whether the suit is \nbarred by the Eleventh Amendment. [Citations.] ‘It would be a novel proposition indeed that the Eleventh Amendment does \nnot bar a suit to enjoin the State itself simply because no money judgment is sought.’ We think it follows a fortiori from this \nproposition that the type of relief sought is irrelevant to abrogate States’ immunity. The Eleventh Amendment does not exist \nsolely in order to ‘preven[t] federal court judgments solely that must be paid out of a State’s treasury.’ [Citations.] Id. \n  \nIn applying the test, a court must determine “first, whether Congress has ‘unequivocally expressed its intent to abrogate the \nimmunity’, and second, whether Congress has acted ‘pursuant to a valid exercise of power”’ in abrogating the immunity. \nSeminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 116 S.Ct. at 1123, citing  Green v. Mansour, 474 U.S. 54, 68, 106 S.Ct. 423, 426 \n(1985). \n  \nThe second part of the analysis recognizes that Congress cannot abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity unless it acts \npursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment. Id. at 1125-1132.4 This part of the test simply means that Congress cannot abrogate \nEleventh Amendment immunity, regardless of its intentions, where it lacks the power to do so. In concluding that Congress \nonly has the power to abrogate the states’ Eleventh Amendment immunity in legislation enacted pursuant to the Fourteenth \nAmendment, the Court expressly overruled its prior holding that Congress could abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity in \nlegislation enacted under the Commerce Clause. Id. at 1128 (overruling  Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U.S. 1 \n(1989)). \n  \nIn this appeal, State Defendants assert only that the Medicaid Act and NHRA were not and could not have been promulgated \nunder Congress’s powers under the Fourteenth Amendment. Concerning the ADA, we do not argue that Congress failed to \nunequivocally express its intent to abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity under the statutory scheme; but instead, we \nargue that Congress did not act pursuant to a valid exercise of power since it did not act pursuant to the Fourteenth \nAmendment. \n  \nThe Court’s stated rationale, in Seminole Tribe, is founded upon a simple but historically sound principle: \nEven when the Constitution vests in Congress complete law making authority over a particular area, the \n6 \n \n\n \n \n \nWorth “”Buttercup’’ HALE, et al., Plaintiffs-Appellees, v...., 1997 WL 33555336...   \n \n \nEleventh  Amendment  prevents  Congressional  authorization  of  suits  by  private  parties  against \nunconsenting States. The Eleventh Amendment restricts the judicial power under Article III, and Article I \ncannot be used to circumvent the constitutional limitations placed upon federal jurisdiction. Petitioner’s \nsuit against the State of Florida must be dismissed for a lack of jurisdiction.”  Seminole Tribe, 116 \nS.Ct. at 1131-32. \n  \n  \nA. State Defendants Are Immune From Suit Under the Medicaid Act. \nThe Seminole Tribe decision quickly puts to rest the anticipated argument by Plaintiffs that the State’s participation in the \nMedicaid Program serves to waive its Eleventh Amendment immunity. Indeed, the Court states: \nThe Eleventh Amendment immunity may not be lifted by Congress unilaterally deciding that it will be \nreplaced by grant of some other authority. Cf.  Atascadero, 473 U.S., at 246-247, 105 S.Ct., at \n3149-3150 ([T]he mere receipt of federal funds cannot establish that a State has consented to suit in \nfederal court”).” Id. at 1125. \n  \n  \nAs to the first prong of the test, it has long been held that Congress in enacting the Medicaid statutory scheme has not \n“unequivocally expressed its intent to abrogate the immunity”.  Amisub Inc. v. Colorado Department of Social Services, \n879 F.2d 789, 793 (10th Cir. 1989);  Gamboa v Rubin, 80 F.3d 1338, 1349-50 (9th Cir. 1996). Indeed, a State’s \nparticipation in the Medicaid Program has not constituted a waiver of its Eleventh Amendment immunity.  Yorktown \nMedical Group, Inc. v. Perales, 948 F.2d 84, 87-88 (2nd Cir. 1991). \n  \nConcerning the second prong, a state’s Eleventh Amendment immunity will only be abrogated if the Act in question was \npromulgated pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment. It is clear beyond dispute that the Medicaid Act was enacted pursuant to \nthe Spending Clause, U.S. Constitution, Article 1, Section 8, clause 1.  Bennett v. White., 865 F.2d 1395, 1404 (3rd Cir. \n1989);  Oklahoma v. Schweiker, 655 F.2d 401, 416-17 (D.C. 1981);  Missouri v. U.S., 918 F.Supp. 1320, 1335 \n(E.D. Mo. 1996); Robinson v. Block, 1987 U.S. District LEXIS 11893 (E.D.Pa. 1987). Therefore, plaintiffs’ claims against \nState  Defendants  for  alleged  violations  of  the  Medicaid  Act,  claims  one  through  four,  are  barred  by  the  Eleventh \nAmendment. \n  \nB. State Defendants Are Immune From Suit Under the Nursing Home Reform Act. \nA conclusion that the Nursing Home Reform Act was enacted pursuant to Congress’ spending powers is supported by \nanalogous and recent precedent. The enactment of the NHRA should be analogized to that of Title VI and Title IX. \n  \nLike the NHRA, Title VI was enacted to remedy certain forms of discrimination. Title VI is legislation enacted not under the \nFourteenth Amendment, but under Congress’ spending powers.  Guardians Association v. Civil Service Commission of \nNew York, 463 U.S. 582, 598, 103 S.Ct. 3221 (1983). \n  \n7 \n \n\n \n \n \nWorth “”Buttercup’’ HALE, et al., Plaintiffs-Appellees, v...., 1997 WL 33555336...   \n \n \nSimilarly, Title IX,5  42 U.S.C. § 2000d et seq. which was patterned after Title VI, was also enacted under Congress’ \nspending powers.  Rowinsky v. Bryan Independent School District, 80 F.3d 1006, 1013, n. 14 (5th Cir. 1996) (“[n]othing \nin Title IX demonstrates an intent to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment”);  Oona v. Santa Rosa City Schools, 890 F. \nSupp. 1452, 1465 (N.D. Cal. 1995) (“[t]his court assumes, absent direction to the contrary from the Ninth Circuit or the \nSupreme Court, that Title IX was likewise enacted pursuant to the Spending Clause”). If Title VI and Title IX are enactments \nunder Congress’ spending powers, so too is the NHRA. \n  \nC. Defendants Are Immune From Suit Under the ADA. \nThe States’ Eleventh Amendment immunity under the ADA requires a more sophisticated analysis than under the other two \nActs. This is because in the ADA Congress not only specifically expressed its intent to abrogate Eleventh Amendment \nimmunity, but, unlike in the Medicaid Act or NHRA, also expressed its intended authority for the legislation. According to \nthe ADA, it was passed under Congress’ Commerce Clause powers and to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment. 42 U.S.C. § \n12101(b)(4). \n  \nStates are immune from suit for any requirements of the ADA that were based on Congress’ powers under the Commerce \nClause. (Seminole Tribes at 1131.) Thus, it is only those obligations of the ADA that can be traced to the Fourteenth \nAmendment for which defendants can be sued in federal court. Plaintiffs have not alleged such obligations under the \nFourteenth Amendment. \n  \nThe incongruence between the requirements of the ADA and those which may be imposed under the Fourteenth Amendment \nwas recently discussed in Pierce v. King: \nThe Fourteenth Amendment has traditionally been understood as protecting individuals from state action \nthat would infringe upon individual liberties. The ADA, however, creates positive rights to entitlements \nagainst other individuals and state governments. Although framed in terms of addressing discrimination, \nthe Act’s operative remedial provisions demand not equal treatment, but special treatment tailored to the \nclaimed disability. In this respect, the ADA differs radically from traditional anti-discrimination laws, \nsuch as Title VII, which seek only a state of affairs where individuals are treated in a neutral manner \nwithout regard to race, sex, age, etc. Unlike traditional anti-discrimination laws, the ADA demands \nentitlement in order to achieve its goals. This the Fourteenth Amendment cannot authorize.  918 F. \nSupp. 932, 940 (E.D.N.C. 1996). \n  \n  \nMost of what Plaintiffs seek in this case are matters not grounded in notions of equal treatment, but instead are affirmative \nobligations requiring actions for them and them alone. In other words, Plaintiffs argue that the State is responsible for \ndeveloping resources in the community so that plaintiffs can receive the services there that they are now receiving in NFs. \n  \n1. Deinstitutionalization of the Mentally Ill Is Not a Right Grounded in the Fourteenth Amendment. \nCourts have consistently rejected the argument that deinstitutionalization is a right grounded in the Fourteenth Amendment. \n(Society for Good Will to Retarded Children v. Cuomo, 737 F.2d 1239 (1989)(Post- Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. \n307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982) courts have held that there is no constitutional right of the mentally ill or mentally \nretarded to placement in the least restrictive environment.)6 \n  \n8 \n \n\n \n \n \nWorth “”Buttercup’’ HALE, et al., Plaintiffs-Appellees, v...., 1997 WL 33555336...   \n \n \n2. Duffy v. Riverland Does Not Establish That Congress Acted Pursuant to a Valid Exercise of Power Since the Court \nDid Not Consider Whether Congress in Passing the ADA Did So Under the Fourteenth Amendment. \nAny reliance by plaintiffs on  Duffy v. Riveland, 98 F3d. 447 (9th Cir. 1996) to establish that Congress successfully \nabrogated the Eleventh Amendment in this case would be wholly misplaced. The court in Duffy neither mentioned the \nSeminole analysis in considering Eleventh Amendment issues nor addressed the only part of the analysis which is applicable \nto the issues raised in this case--the source of congressional authority for the enactment of the ADA. The Court merely noted \nCongress’ intent to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment in enacting the ADA. \n  \nII. \nEX PARTE YOUNG DOES NOT PROVIDE AN EXCEPTION TO DEFENDANTS’ ELEVENTH AMENDMENT \nIMMUNITY. \n  \nEx Pane  Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), provides no exception to Defendants’ Eleventh Amendment immunity and the \ndistrict court’s conclusion to the contrary was erroneous. (ER 52-53.) Under the Eleventh Amendment, “an unconsenting \nState is immune from suits brought in federal courts by her own citizens as well as by citizens of another State.”  Edelman \nv. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 662-663 (1973) (citing  Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1 (1890)). In general, Ex Pane Young \npermits a suit for injunctive relief challenging the constitutionality of a state official’s action.  Pennhurst State School & \nHosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 102 (1983) (Pennhurst II). Thus, “the crucial question is whether the relief sought in a suit \nnominally addressed to the officer is relief against the sovereign.”  Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Corp., 337 U.S. 682, \n687 (1949). There can be no question that this case, although captioned with the names of individual state officials, is a suit \nseeking wide-ranging reforms on the part of the State Defendants in administering the State’s mental health system. \nAccordingly, the suit is against the State of California and Ex Pane Young provides no exception to Eleventh Amendment \nimmunity. \n  \nFurthermore, Ex Pane Young is inapplicable because this case is based on alleged statutory, and not constitutional, violations. \nAs the Supreme Court has cautioned, Ex Pane Young is not to be given “expansive interpretation.”  Pennhurst II, 465 U.S. \nat 102. Despite this admonition, the Ninth Circuit extended the Ex Pane Young exception to suits for injunctive relief \nchallenging the legality of state officials’ actions under federal statutes.  Almond Hill School v. U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, \n768 F.2d 1030 (1985). The appropriateness of this extension is doubtful. As recently noted by two Ninth Circuit judges, the \nCourt “took a wrong turn in Almond Hill because it represented a “persistent erosion of the Eleventh Amendment by \nexpanding judicial exceptions within this circuit.”  Natural Resources Defense Council v. California Department of \nTransportation, 96 F.3d 420, 424 (9th Cir. 1996) (O’Scannlain and Kleinfeld concurring). \n  \nThe extension of the Ex Pane Young exception to cases arising under federal legislation was improper and will likely be \naddressed in a case presently before the Supreme  Court. Coeur d’Alene Tribe of Idaho v. Idaho, 42 F.3d 1244 (9th Cir. \n1994), cert. granted, 116 S. Ct. 1415 (1996). The extension was inappropriate because it is in contravention with the very \npolicies behind Ex Pane Young: \n[T]he scope of any such relief [is to] be constrained by principles of comity and federalism. “Where, as here, the exercise of \nauthority by state officials is attacked, federal courts must be constantly mindful of the ‘special delicacy of the adjustment to \nbe preserved between federal equitable power and State administration of its own law.’ \n  \n  \nPennhurst II, 465 U.S. at 104, n.13 (citations omitted). Thus, the scope of the Ex Pane Young exception requires \nbalancing the states’ sovereign immunity with the rights and powers secured by other parts of the Constitution. “[T]he need \nto promote the supremacy of federal law must be accommodated to the constitutional immunity of the States.” Id. \n9 \n \n\n \n \n \nWorth “”Buttercup’’ HALE, et al., Plaintiffs-Appellees, v...., 1997 WL 33555336...   \n \n \n  \nExtending Ex Pane Young to cases alleging violations of federal statutory law against these State Defendants in their \nadministration of the State of California’s provision of mental health services essentially nullifies the constitutional immunity \nof the States and subjects them to suits in federal court going far beyond the protections contained in the Constitution. \nBecause such an extension violates principles of federalism, the district court’s reliance on Ex Parte Young was mistaken and \nmust be reversed. \n  \nCONCLUSION \nThe district court’s dismissal order must be reversed. The statutes contained in the ADA cannot be considered to have been a \nvalid exercise of congressional power under the Fourteenth Amendment, and the State Defendants are immune from the \napplication of the ADA, Medicaid Act, and NHRA, pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment for which there is no exception \nunder Ex Pane Young. \n  \nFootnotes \n \n1  Designations to the record will be as follows: “CD” will refer to the pleading as designated on the district court clerk’s docket \n  sheet. “ER” will refer to the pleading as designated in appellants’ excerpts of the record. \n \n2  Denial of a motion to dismiss based upon a claim of absolute immunity is an immediately appealable interlocutory order. Trevino \n  By and Through Cruz v. Gates, 23 F.3d 1480, 1481 (9th Cir. 1994), cert. den., ___ U.S. __, 115 S.Ct. 327. \n \n3  The Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution of the United States provides that “The Judicial power of the United States shall not \n  be construed to extend to any suit in law and equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of \nanother State, or by citizens or subjects of any foreign State.” \n \n4 \nThe Ninth Circuit has recognized and applied this two part analysis of Eleventh Amendment immunity.  Spokane Tribe of \n \nIndians v. Washington State, 28 F.3d 991 (9th Cir. 1994). \n \n5 \nTitle IX is codified at  20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq. \n \n \n6 \nSociety for Goodwill to Retarded Children at 1249, citing  Rennie v.
