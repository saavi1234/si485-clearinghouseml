    "summary": "<p>On May 4, 2000, a group of individuals with developmental disabilities (each through a parent as next friend), together with several interested advocacy organizations and service providers, filed this suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against the state of California. The plaintiffs, represented by the Disability Rights Education & Defense Fund, sought class certification, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief under: (1) Title XIX of the Social Security Act (the Medicaid Act), 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq.; (2) Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134; and, (3) Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) together with its regulations. Enforcement of the Medicaid Act claims was premised on 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Chiefly, the plaintiffs sought injunctive relief requiring the state to provide wages and benefits for community-based service providers at substantially the same rates as those paid to state institutions. They alleged that the lower wages paid community-based facilities violated the Americans with Disabilities Act by causing some individuals with disabilities to unnecessarily become or remain institutionalized. </p><p>Some background on the Medicaid Act is helpful.  Through the Medicaid Act, the federal government provides funds to participating states to help them provide health care services to qualifying low-income or otherwise needful individuals. States that accept these funds must ensure that their state Medicaid program complies with certain requirements, as laid out in 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(1)-(65). In 1981, Congress enacted the Home and Community Based Services (\"HCBS\") waiver program. This program provides Medicaid reimbursement to states for the provision of community based services to individuals who would otherwise require institutional care. To qualify for a waiver, the state must show that the cost of care for that individual through the waiver program will be less than or equal to the cost of care in an institution. See 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c).  See generally Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 600-03 (1999) (tracing the origins and discussing the application of HCBS).</p><p>The plaintiffs claimed that because California pays community based service providers participating in the HCBS waiver program lower wages than it pays employees in state institutions, the State was violating the provision of the Medicaid Act that requires state plans to \"provide such methods and procedures relating to the utilization of, and the payment for, care and services available under the plan . . . as may be necessary to . . . <i>assure that payments are consistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care and are sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services are available under the plan at least to the extent that such care and services are available to the general population in the geographic area</i>[.]\" 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A). Plaintiffs further claimed that the lower wage rate in community based programs has caused some persons with developmental disabilities to remain institutionalized unnecessarily. Plaintiffs argued that this constituted discrimination against them in violation of the ADA and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. To remedy this, the plaintiffs sought injunctive relief requiring state officials to increase wages and benefits for community based services to match those provided to employees of in-state institutions. Thus, the plaintiffs advanced three causes of action, namely: (1) the § 30(A) claim (42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A)); (2) the ADA claim; and, (3) the § 504 claim.</p><p>After initially denying the plaintiffs' motion for class certification, the District Court (Judge Claudia Wilken) granted the plaintiffs' renewed motion for class certification on August 2, 2001. See <a href=\"http://clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/PB-CA-0011-9000.pdf\">Docket at 17, 19</a>. During this time the parties also had several discovery disputes. These revolved around the plaintiffs' requests for production of documents to the defendants regarding budgetary and fiscal information related to community service providers. This culminated in a motion to compel, which the District Court (Magistrate Judge Joseph C. Spero) granted in part and denied in part on November 19, 2001. Sanchez v. Johnson, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25233 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 19, 2001).</p><p>On August 10, 2001, the defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings with respect to the § 30(A) claim, on the ground that § 30(A) does not provide a private right of action enforceable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. On September 24, 2001, Judge Wilken denied the defendants' motion for partial judgment on the pleadings. In response, the defendants moved the court for certification to take an interlocutory appeal to the Ninth Circuit. On February 28, 2002, Judge Wilken also denied this motion. Both the court's September 24, 2001, and February 28, 2002, orders and opinions involved the court holding, inter alia, that the plaintiffs were entitled to enforce rights granted to them under § 30(A) of the Medicaid Act by means of 42 U.S.C. § 1983.</p><p>During March, April and early May of 2002, both sides filed cross-motions for summary judgment with respect to various aspects of the case. The defendants moved for summary judgment as to the ADA and § 504 claims on the grounds that the plaintiffs had failed to establish sufficient facts establish a prima facie case of discrimination. By an opinion and order dated August 6, 2002, Judge Wilkin denied all of the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motion for summary judgment. Specifically, the court granted summary judgment as to the plaintiffs' ADA and § 504 claims of discrimination.  As explained by the Ninth Circuit on appeal, the district court found that the plaintiffs had failed to establish any material factual dispute with respect to three key issues:</p><p><blockquote> \"First, the court held that 'even if unjustified institutionalization is occurring, [the plaintiffs] have failed to show that an increase in wages and benefits for community based direct care workers would remedy the alleged violation.' Second, the court held that the relief proposed by [the plaintiffs] is not a 'reasonable modification' of California's current policies and practices because the $1.4 billion of extra expenditure they request would represent a forty percent increase in the State's budget for developmentally disabled services. Third, the court held that California already has in place an acceptable plan for deinstitutionalization, the disruption of which would involve a fundamental alteration of the State's current policies and practices in contravention of the Supreme Court's instructions in <i>Olmstead</i>.\"</blockquote></p><p>However, Judge Wilkin's denied the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment as to the § 30(A) claim and allowed the case to go forward exclusively on this issue. The parties engaged in discovery over the course of the following year. </p><p>On August 6, 2003, the defendants filed a motion for reconsideration of the district court's denial of their 2001 motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the § 30(A) claim. The defendants claimed that the Supreme Court's subsequent decision in Gonzaga University v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273 (2002), undermined the authorities relied on by the court when it denied judgment on the pleadings, and that reconsideration was thus warranted. <i>Gonzaga University</i> clarified the standard for evaluating whether a statute creates a private right of action.</p><p>On January 5, 2004, Judge Wilkin granted the defendants' motion for reconsideration, reversing her earlier decision and granting the defendants judgment on the pleadings as to the § 30(A) claim. <i><a href=\"http://clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/PB-CA-0011-0001.pdf\">Sanchez</i>, 301 F. Supp. 2d at 1064-65</a>. Judge Wilkin held that there was no indication that Congress intended to create a private right of action with § 30(A), and that, accordingly, none of the plaintiffs could bring suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. In holding so, Judge Wilkin noted that there had been \"no post-<i>Gonzaga</i> case in which a court, considering the guidelines articulated in <i>Gonzaga</i>, has found that § 30(A) gives Medicaid recipients a private right enforceable under § 1983.\" Since the § 30(A) claim was the sole remaining claim, this decision terminated the case in its entirety.</p><p>The plaintiffs appealed the district court's decisions with respect to both their § 30(A) claim as well as their ADA and § 504 claims. The plaintiffs argued § 30(A) does indeed create a private right that is enforceable under § 1983, and that the district court misinterpreted the import of <i>Gonzaga</i> in rejecting their claim. Regarding the ADA and § 504 claims the plaintiffs argued that in granting summary judgment to the defendants, the court had improperly resolved four factual disputes, namely: (1) that the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate entitlement to class-wide relief because of a failure to show more than \"isolated\" and \"sporadic\" instances of developmentally disabled individuals who were ready for community based services but were still institutionalized; (2) that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a causal link between low wages and benefits for direct care workers in community service programs for the developmentally disabled and the low rate of deinstitutionalization; (3) that California has a \"comprehensive plan\" for deinstitutionalization which met the requirements of showing reasonable progress; and (4) that the cost of the relief sought by Plaintiffs constituted a \"fundamental alteration\" of California's Developmental Disabilities Program.</p><p>On August 2, 2005, a three-member panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Judge Diarmuid F. O'Scannlain writing for the court) unanimously rejected the plaintiffs' claims and affirmed the district court decisions. The Ninth Circuit held that that Congress \"did not unambiguously create an individually enforceable right in § 30(A) that would be remediable under § 1983 either by recipients or providers of Medicaid services.\" <i><a href=\"http://clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/PB-CA-0011-0005.pdf\">Sanchez</i>, 416 F.3d at 1067</a>. The court further explained that the relief requested by the plaintiffs under their ADA and § 504 claims \"would require the 'fundamental alteration' of a comprehensive, working plan for deinstitutionalization in contravention of <i>Olmstead</i>.\" </p>",

    "summary_short": "In May of 2000, several individuals representing a class of developmentally disabled individuals, together with organizations that advocate for, or provide community-based services to, the developmentally disabled, brought this action against the state of California. The plaintiffs alleged that the state was engaging in a practice of systematically underfunding community based care of disabled individuals, and that this violated (1) Title XIX of the Social Security Act (the Medicaid Act), 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq.; (2) Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134; and, (3) Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) together with the regulations thereunder. After four years of contentious and drawn-out discovery, the district court granted the defendants judgment on the pleadings with respect to the § 30(A) claim, and granted summary judgment as to the other claims. On August 2, 2005, the Ninth Circuit affirmed these decisions.",

Plaintiffs sought an order \"enjoining\ndefendants at least to double current community direct care wages and\nbenefits...\" a remedy they conceded would cost California $1.4 billion annually.\nThe district court properly concluded that not one of the named Plaintiffs was\nunjustly institutionalized, that the proposed modification was unreasonable,\nineffective and would fundamentally alter the California's programs. (Appellants'\nExcerpts 0fRecord on Appeal (\"ER\"), Vol. 10, Tab 253, pp. 38-39, 42-45 (\"Vol.\n#/Tab #/P. #\").) The evidence is also undisputed that California is committing\nmillions of dollars statewide - as much as $200,000 per person per year - to the\nhighly individualized task of developing programs that assure that those persons in\ninstitutions can find appropriate community placements. (Appellees'\nSupplemental Excerpts of Record (\"SER\"), Vol. 1, Tab 4, at p. 96.) The district\ncourt thus found that California has a comprehensive, effectively working plan for\ndeinstitutionalization. (ER 10/253/45.) The court also correctly found that\nPlaintiffs had no right to enforce their Medicaid claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983,\nand dismissed the remainder of Plaintiffs' case. (ER 10/507/9.)\n1\n\nSTATEMENT OF ISSUES\n1. In an action seeking injunctive relief on behalfofa statewide class of\npersons with developmental disabilities, on the theory that class members have\nbeen institutionalized in violation of the ADA, may the court issue injunctive\nrelief if it finds that none of the named Plaintiffs have been improperly\ninstitutionalized?\n2. In the action described above, where the Plaintiffs contend that the\nclass is improperly institutionalized because of a disparity in wages between state\nemployees and employees of private agencies who provide community care, did\nthe district court abuse its discretion in finding that the Plaintiffs' proffered\nevidence was insufficient to warrant the requested class-wide injunction because\ntheevidence failed to establish a widespread pattern of illegal institutionalization?\n3. In the fiction described above, was summary judgment properly\ngranted to Defendants under Ohnstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999) where the\nevidence:\na. showed no causal relationship between increasing the wages of\nemployees in private agencies and increasing the rate of\ndeinstitutionalization; or\n///\n///\n\nb. established that the state has a comprehensive, effectively\nworking plan to move persons with developmental disabilities\nfrom institutions into community settings; or\nc. failed to demonstrate that their proposed accommodation -\nincreasing wages to employees of private agencies at an\nadditional annual cost of $1.4 billion per year - is reasonable\nand the Defendants demonstrate the accommodation would\nresult in a fundamental alteration to the state's program of\nservices?\n4. Does 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A) unambiguously confer a right on\nMedicaid recipients enforceable under § 1983?\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nExcept as follows, Defendants agree with the Plaintiffs' Statement of the\nCase.\nThe district court denied Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment in its\nentirety and granted in part and denied in part the Defendants' motion for\nsummary judgment. (ER 10/253/1-59.) Plaintiffs' first cause of action under the\nADA and § 504 alleged that Defendants had discriminated against Plaintiffs by\npermitting wages in state-operated institutions to be higher than wages paid to\nemployees of community-based private providers. The court ruled that Plaintiffs\n3\n\nfailed to establish that increasing wages would significantly reduce the numbers of\npersons allegedly subject to unjustifiable institutionalization, (ld. at 40-41); the\nrelief proposed by Plaintiffs - a $1.4 billion increase in wages for direct-care\ncommunity-service workers - would constitute a fundamental alteration of\nDefendants' programs (Id. at. 43); Plaintiffs failed to overcome California's\nshowing that it has in place a comprehensive, effectively working plan for placing\npersons in the community (Id. at 45); and, Plaintiffs' evidence suggesting some\nunjustified institutionalization is \"isolated\" and \"sporadic\" and does not warrant\nclass-wide relief. (ld. at 46.)\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nThe district court correctly granted Defendants' motion for summary\njudgment on two grounds: Plaintiffs' failure to demonstrate material factual\ndisputes that if resolved in their favor would establish certain elements of their\nprima facie case, and the insufficiency of plaintiffs' evidence to support the\nissuance of class-wide relief.\nThe district court correctly held that Plaintiffs do not have a private right of\naction under § 1983 because § 1396a(a)(30)(A) does not establish an\nunambiguous congressional intent to confer a private right of action on Medicaid\nrecipients.\n///\n\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\n1. California's Statutory Scheme for Providing Services for the\nDevelopmentally Disabled.\nIn 1977, California enacted the Lanterman Act, a comprehensive statutory\nframework to provide a \"pattern of facilities and services sufficiently complete to\nmeet the needs of each person with developmental disabilities, regardless of age or\ndegree of handicap, and at each stage of life.\" Welf. & Inst. Code, §§ 4500-\n4846Y\nThe purpose of the statutory scheme is...to prevent or minimize\nthe institutionalization...and their dislocation from family and\ncommunity (§§ 4501, 4509, 4685), and to enable them to\napproximate the pattern of everyday living of nondisabled\npersons...to lead more independent and productive lives in the\ncommunity (§§ 4501, 4750-4751).\nARC v. Department of Developmental Services, 38 Cal. 3d 384, 388 (1985).\nThe Department of Developmental Services (\"DDS\") \"has jurisdiction over\nthe execution of the laws relating to the care, custody, and treatment of\ndevelopmentally disabled persons\" (often called \"consumers\"). § 4416. These\nservices are provided through a unique administrative structure incorporating\nprivate and public institutions. The Act creates 21 Regional Centers (\"RCs\"),\noperated by private, nonprofit community agencies under contract with DDS. RCs\nStatutory references are to provisions in the California Welfare &\nInstitutions Code unless otherwise stated, and attached in Tab A of the Addendum.\n\narecharged with providing consumers \"access to the facilities and services best\nsuited to developmentally disabled persons throughout their lifetime.\" § 4620.\nRCs coordinate services provided to consumers from assessmentand\ndiagnosis to 24-hour-out-of-home care andevery level-of-care in between.\n§§ 4620, 4630, 4648. (ER 7/187/3-4.) Each consumer is assigned a service\ncoordinator who helps develop an Individual Program Plan (\"IPP\") for services,\nand assists the consumer and their family in obtaining services. §4646.\n(ER 7/187/4.)\nRCs determine the services to berendered and arrange their delivery.\n§§4620, 4630, 4648, 4651. DDS is responsible for developing uniform systems\nof accounting, budgeting, and reporting (§ 4631(a)), setting rates for out-of-home\ncare (§ 4681,) auditing, and funding RCs. § 4780.5. DDS \"is basically limited to\npromoting the cost-effectiveness of the operations of RCs, anddoes not extend to\nthe control of the manner in which they provide services or in general operate their\nprograms.\" ARC, 38 Cal. 3d at 390.\n2. The Scope of Services Provided to Consumers.\nDDS administers a system providing extensive services in a variety of\nsettings. Most consumers live in their own homes. DDS provides a number of\nresidential alternatives for consumers living out-of-home that are either operated\nor funded by DDS. (ER 7/187/5-8.)\n\nThe DDS directly operates five large Developmental Centers (\"DCs\") and\ntwo smaller facilities located throughout California. These facilities provide\nservices to individuals who have been determined by RCs to require programs,\ntraining, care, treatment and supervision in a structured health facility on a 24-\nhour basis. (ER 7/187/13.)\nOther living situations include: (1) Intermediate Care Facilities\n(\"ICF/DDs\"), licensed health facilities providing 24-hour-per-day services;\n(2)Community-Care Facilities (\"CCFs\"), licensed facilities providing 24-hour\nnon-medical community-based residential care to individuals who are in need of\n•personal services, supervision, and/or assistance essential for self-protection or\nsustaining activities of daily living; (3) Family-Home Agencies, approved family\nhomes for up to two adult consumers per home to reside with a family; and (4)\nSupported Living Services (\"SLS\"), which consist of a broad range of services to\nadult consumers choosing to live in their own homes. (ER 7/187/6-8.)\nIn addition to residential services, DDS funds many non-residential\nprograms to assist consumers in achieving maximum independence, including\nday-programs, vocational programs, transportation, healthcare, respite services,\ncommunity integration training, community activities support, adaptive skills\ntraining, behavior management, tutors, special education, recreation therapists,\ncounselors, infant development specialists, and speechpathologists.\n7\n\n(ER 7/187/9-10.)\n3. The Funding Structure.\nThe services provided under the Lanterman Act are a statutory entitlement.\nCalifornia is the only state that makes services to persons with developmental\ndisabilities an entitlement regardless of family income. (SER 1/2/36.) For\nconsumers receiving care in the community, his or her RC, with the agreement of\nthe consumer, selects vendors to provide services. In most cases, DDS sets the\nrate at which vendors are reimbursed by the state for their services.\n(ER 7/187/10.)\nThe reimbursement rates paid by the state depend on the nature of the\nservice provided. For instance, ICFs are reimbursed at rates established by the\nDepartment of Health Services under the Medi-Cal program. The rates for CCFs\nare specified in regulations of DDS and vary depending on the level of care. Day\nprograms receive a daily or hourly-rates based on vendor cost-statements. SLS\nagencies negotiate contracts with RCs on an individual basis for each consumer.\n(ER 7/187/10-11 .) '_\nSome services are eligible for reimbursement from federal sources.\nRecipients must essentially be indigent to be eligible. The Medicaid agency\nprovides matching funds equal to 50% of the expenditures for these services.\n(ER 7/187/11.)\n\nCalifornia is aggressively seeking to enhancefederal matching funds.\nHowever, California will never obtain federal matching funds for all services\ncurrently provided. While all consumers arelegally entitled to services funded by\nstategeneral funds, some consumers will not qualify for matching funds.\nAssuming that all of the prerequisites for full participation were satisfied, the\nDepartment calculated in 2002 that it could receive $115,068,000 in additional\nfederal funds out of a total DDS budget of $2.2 billion. (ER 7/187/11-12; ER\n6/184/3.)-_\n4. The Current Developmental Center Population.\nThe remaining population in the DCs consists primarily of consumers who:\n(1) oppose discharge, or whose families are opposed to discharge if that\nopposition would prevent successful placement; (2) require significant skilled\nmedical care and whose community placement has to be made cautiously to avoid\nhealth and safety risks; and (3) those who exhibit extreme self-injurious, assaultive\nor anti-social behavior. (ER 7/187/2; SER 1/141.)\nDC residents present very significant challenges to placement in the\ncommunity. In general, DC residents suffer from more profound levels of\n2 Plaintiffs improperly contest Ms. Marquez' testimony With the transcript\nof her deposition taken after, the order granting summary judgment. Defendants\nhave filed a motion to exclude this evidence from Appellants' Excerpts of Record\non appeal.\n\nretardation, more serious health conditions anddifficult-to-manage behaviors.\n(ER 6/186/4-5; ER 6/183/4-6; SER 1/142.) The management of DC residents is\nfurther complicated by the fact that many presentboth significant medical needs\nand very difficult behaviors. (ER 6/186/6; SER 1/151-152.)\nThe severe conditions that DC residents exhibit do not automatically\nprevent community placement. They do, however, represent significant challenges\nto staff seeking living arrangements with the right mix of services to assure\nstability and safety. Because needs vary widely, residents require many different\ntypes of services in order to live successfully in the community. (ER 7/18714;\nER 6/1834.)\n5. The Community Placement Plan: California's Program to Place DC\nResidents in Community-Based Settings.\nDDS collaborates with RCs to develop strategies specifically designed to\nencourage the development of community-based care. (ER 7/187/14.) As part of\nthis effort, DDS developed a system of Community Placement Plans (\"CPP\") that\nmoves residents from DCs to community residential settings on a carefully\nplanned and individualized basis. (Id.; ER 6/183/8.)\nThe RCs identify needed services for each consumer in the CPP and identify\navailable community services. It may be necessary for the RC to develop\nresources that do not yet exist. Services may include insuring the proper level-of-\n10\n\ncare, one-on-one behavioral or program support in residential and/or day\nprograms, extended pre-placement activities, facility visits, and specialized\nsupports to address cultural, physical, and mental health needs, and social and day\nprogram needs. DDS provides substantial funding for development of services\nnecessary to implement individual CPPs. The CPP can also fund one-time start-up\ncosts to assist the development of new services. §4469.2. (ER 6/183/9.)\nResource development is time-consuming and complex. The cost of\nservices identified in the CPP is highly individualized. The 2002/2003 CPP\nallocates as much as $286,000 for the first year that a consumer is discharged from\na DC. The budget also estimates the costs for the second year following\ncommunity-placement. The 2003/2003 CPP allocates $18,662,000 for 183\nconsumers - an average of nearly $102,000 per year per consumer to maintain the\ncommunity placements after the first year. (ER 6/183/10.)\nOnce the resources are developed, additional planning and preparation are\nnecessary to achieve a successful placement. Consumers identified as ready for\ncommunity placement follow a specific plan for transition and discharge from the\nDC. (ER 6/183/13.)\nDDS commits substantial resources to the task of encouraging the\ndevelopment of support services in the least-restrictive setting possible.\n(ER 7/187/15.) The 2002-2003 budget increased CPP funding well over 60%,\n11\n\nfrom $29,777,000 to $50,220,000. (SER i/150.) This sum includes $1,462,000 to\"\nconduct assessmentson an estimated 260 consumers and $3,302,000 to develop 42\nnew CCFs and I0 new ICFs. (ER 6/183/9.)\nDDS is continuing efforts to reduce the DC population, andexpects the\nclosure of another DC by 2007. Two DCs have already closed due to community-\nplacements of over 3300 consumers since 1993. The Lanterman Act promises\nwhatever services are necessary, so DCs serve asakind of\"safety net\" for\nconsumers in behavioral, medical or psychological crises. (ER 7/187/13-16.)\n6. Declines in DC Population and Increases in Caseload and Expenditures\nfor Community-Based Care.\nAs a result of California's policies and efforts, the population in the\nDCs has fallen dramatically in the last 10 years, from 6% to 2% of the total\npopulation. (ER 6/186/3-4.) During this period, the state has increased the level\nof funding to community-based services that far exceeds the rapid growth in\ncaseload and, as a result, the statewide network of community-based services has\ngrown substantially. (ER 6/186/2; ER 6/186/3; SER 2/10/441.) There has been a\nsteady growth in the numbers of agencies providing every type of service.\n(ER 6/186/20-21 ; ER 7/188/3; SER 1/3/51-68.) Plaintiff-organizations admit that\ntheir programs have grown dramatically. (SER 2/10/357; SER 2/10/350.)\n///\n12\n\nCalifornia's record of placing consumers in the community exceeds the\nnational average with regard to residential placements, SLS, family-support\nprograms, andthe percentage of consumers living in small community facilities.\nThe percentage of consumers living in large institutions is less than the national\naverage. (SER 2/10/438-441.)\n7. The Named Plaintiffs and Purported Class Members.\nThe district court described the situations of eachof the seven named\nplaintiffs, which Defendants hereby incorporate. (ER 10/253/29-33.) The court\nfound no evidence of unjustified institutionalization and only a hypothetical risk\nof institutionalization for the five individuals living in the community.\n(ER 10/253/38-39.) Plaintiffs do not challenge those factual findings on appeal.\nWith regard to unnamed plaintiffs, Plaintiffs submitted five In Re Hop 3-/\nOrders and 23 IPPs of DC residents. (ER 5/6/48, 48-66, 83-159, 160-211; ER\n3/170/1-177.) These records describe people whose medical and/or behavioral\nconditions require specialized services, making community placement very\nchallenging. Medical conditions include history of choking, seizures,\ntracheostomy, cerebral palsy with spastic diplegia, macerated hands, and tinea\ncorpora. Severe behaviors include self-injurious behavior, aggressive behavior\n3 Pursuant to In Re Hop 29 Cal. 3d 82 (1981), a placement hearing and\nannual review is conducted whereby the court determines the appropriateness of\nan individual's placement in a DC.\n13\n\nthat has resulted in emergency psychiatric admissions, lack of safety awareness,\nsuicidal ideation, and AWOL.\nARGUMENT\nI. PLAINTIFFS CANNOT PROVE THEIR ADA AND SECTION 504\nCLAIMS\nA. Plaintiffs' Theory of Liability under the ADA and Section 504.\nPlaintiffs' theory of liability begins with two propositions. First, they allege\nthat large numbers of persons with developmental disabilities are being subjected\nto or are at risk of unnecessary institutionalization. (ER 1/1/22.) Second, they\ncontend employees of private community-based programs that serve disabled\npersons earn less than civil service employees who work at the state-operated\nDCs. (ER 1/1/23.) Plaintiffs then hypothesize that improper institutionalization is\ncaused by the wage differential. (ER 1/1/25-28.) Their proposed remedy would\nestablish wage parity at an annual cost of $1.4 billion, which would, under\nPlaintiffs' theory, permit private community-based facilities to hire and retain\nmore and better employees, who will create additional community-based\nprograms, which will, in turn, allow more persons to be moved to community\nsettings.\nB. The Standard of Review on Plaintiffs' ADA and Section 504\nClaims.\nThe district court granted summary judgment for Defendants on Plaintiffs'\n14\n\nclaims under the ADA/Section 504 on two separate grounds. A separate standard\nof review applies for each ground.\nThe court found that Plaintiff' evidence did not warrant class-wide\ninjunctive relief because the evidence did not support a finding of 'systemwide'\nviolations of the ADA. (ER 10/253/45-46.) This ruling is reviewed for abuse of\ndiscretion. \"We review a sunmlary judgment granting or denying a permanent\ninjunction for abuse of discretion and application of the correct legal principles.\"\nMidgett v. Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District of Oregon, 254 F. 3d\n846, 849 (9th Cir. 2001).\nThe court also granted summary judgment on the ground that Plaintiffs had\nfailed to raise factual disputes, which if resolved in their favor, would establish\ncertain elements of their prima facie case. This ruling is reviewed de novo. Weyer\nv. Twentieth Century Fox Fihn Corp., 198 F. 3d 1104, 1108 (9th Cir. 2000).\nC. The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in Granting\nSummary Judgment Because Plaintiffs' Evidence Does Not\nSupport System-Wide Injunctive Relief.\n1. Standards for issuance of class-wide injunctive relief.\nPlaintiffs sought injunctive relief mandating wage increases for each direct-\ncare employee of each community-based provider in California. Plaintiffs must\ntherefore advance evidence that this remedy is necessary to prevent widespread,\nwholesale violations of the ADA. Hodgers-Durgin v. De La Vina, 199 F. 3d 1037,\n15\n\n1042 (9th Cir. 1999). Plaintiffs do not meet this standard merely by arguing they\nare \"subject to a governmental institution that was not organized or managed\nproperly.\" Id., quoting Lewis, 518 U.S. at 349-50 (1996). Furthermore, Plaintiffs\n\"must contend with the well-established rule that the Government has traditionally\nbeen granted the widest latitude in the dispatch of its own internal affairs.\"\nMidgett, at 254 F. 3d at 850, quoting Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. at 378-79.\n4\nTwo principles governing the issuance of class-wide injunctive relief apply\nin this case. First, to obtain class wide injunctive relief, the named Plaintiffs must\nshow that they personally have been injured, not that injury has been suffered by\nunidentified class members. Lewis, 518 U.S. 343, quoting Simon v. Eastern\nKentucky Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U.S. 26, 40 n. 20 (1976); Hodgers-\nDurgin, i99 F. 3d at 1045. Second, to obtain class-wide injunctive relief,\nplaintiffs' evidence must establish systematic discrimination. Proof of sporadic\nacts of discrimination is not sufficient. See Franks v. Bowman, 424 U.S. 747, 751\n(1976); hzternational Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324,\n357-360 (1967_); Armstrong v. Davis, 275 F. 3d 849, 861 (9th Cir. 2001). To make\nthis showing, plaintiffs must establish that the state has either a \"written policy\" or\na \"pattern of officially sanctioned.., behavior\" of involuntary institutionalization\nof disabled persons, and that this unjustified institutionalization of disabled people\nis \"widespread enough to justify system-wide relief.\"/d, at 861 (citations\n16\n\nomitted); at 870 (quoting Lewis, 518 U.S. at 359).\n2. Plaintiffs are not entitled to systemwide injunctive relief on\nbehalf of the class because they failed to demonstrate that\nthe named Plaintiffs have been subjected to unjustified\ninstitutionalization.\nThe district court found that none of the named Plaintiffs were unjustifiably\ninstitutionalized or at risk of being unjustifiably institutionalized in violation of\nthe ADA and Section 504. (ER 10/253/38.) Five of the named Plaintiffs were\ncurrently living in the community and there was no \"more than a hypothetical risk\nthat these individuals may be institutionalized.\" (ER 10/253/39.) Only two of the\nnamed plaintiffs resided in institutions, but because of the \"States's ongoing,\nactive efforts to place these individuals in the community in situations that meet\ntheir individualized needs,\" the court concluded that \"their current\ninstitutionalization cannot be deemed 'unjustified.'\" (Id.) On appeal, Plaintiffs\ndo not challenge this finding. Instead, Plaintiffs rely exclusively on evidence\nconcerning the circumstances of unnamed class members. (Appellants' Opening\nBrief (\"AOB\"), pp. 14, 50.) Such evidence, as a matter of law, is insufficient to\nsupport a claim for class wide injunctive relief:\nUnless the named plaintiffs are themselves entitled to seek\ninjunctive relief, they may not represent a class seeking that\nrelief. Any injury unnamed members of this proposed class\nmay have suffered is simply irrelevant to the question whether\nthe named plaintiffs are entitled to the injunctive relief they\nseek.\n17\n\nHodgers-Durgin, 199 F. 3d at 1045.\n3. Plaintiffs failed to provide sufficient evidence of systematic\nviolations of the ADA to support issuance of a class-wide\ninjunction.\nThe district court found that \"[t]he evidence of unjustified\ninstitutionalization provided by Plaintiffs is \"isolated\" and \"sporadic,\" and\ntherefore does not warrant class-wide relief.\" (ER 10/253/46.) Plaintiffs do not\ndispute that under Lewis v. Case3,, supra and Armstrong v. Davis, supra, they are\nentitled to class-wide injunctive relief only if the prove widespread and systematic\nunjustified institutionalization. On appeal, they contend that they have raised\nmaterial issues of fact, which if resolved in their favor, would meet this burden.\n(AOB, pp. 48-50.) However, it is not sufficient for Plaintiffs to argue that district\ncourt \"improperly resolved factual disputes.\" (Id.) It is Plaintiffs' burden to\ndemonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion. (See section I.B. above.) An\nabuse of discretion occurs if the district court bases its decision on an erroneous\nlegal standard or on clearly erroneous findings of fact. U.S.v. Alisal Water Corp.,\n370 F. 3d 915, 921 (9th Cir. 2004). A finding is clearly erroneous when \"although\nthere is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left\nwith the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\"\nAnderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 573 (1985). A review of he\nevidence cited by Plaintiffs demonstrates that the district court did not abuse its\n18\n\ndiscretion in finding Plaintiffs' evidence insufficient.\nPlaintiffs rely heavily on evidence that the pace of deinstitutionalization is\nslower now than in the early 1990s. (AOB, p. 49.) However, it is undisputed that\nthe state depopulated its institutions by first placing in the community the least\nseverely disabled residents. (SER 1/6/3-4.) The developmental centers now house\nthose residents who are the most difficult to place. (ER 6/186/4-6.) Plaintiffs also\ncite \"evidence\" that some 1100 persons have been \"recommended for community\nplacement.\" The undisputed evidence is that the source of this data is unreliable\nand that the data may reflect recommendations that represent only a long term goal\n(SER 1/4/93-94), and the district court so found. (ER 10/253/19-20.) Plaintiffs do\nnot produce evidence that the data upon which they rely is reliable or that it\ndemonstrates that any of the persons identified are improperly institutionalized.\nInstead, Plaintiffs contend that appellees have failed to explain the meaning of\n\"recommended for community placement.\" (AOB, p. 14.) In so arguing, Plaintiffs\nput the shoe on the wrong foot. It is their burden to show that the cited evidence\nwill support an inference of improper institutionalization. Their failure to advance\nadmissible evidence that the data they cite support such a conclusion is fatal to\ntheir claim.\nThe district court did find that Plaintiffs had marshaled enough evidence\nthat \"suggests unjustified institutionalization\" as to \"several\" unnamed class\n19\n\nmembers. The court cited In re Hop reports, a declaration from one Regional\nCenter director and some IPPs. However, these represent only a handful of the\nover 3000 persons living in institutions. Furthermore, the evidence only\n\"suggests\" rather than \"proves'.' or \"establishes\" that the institutionalization is\nQ ,\nunjustified as to any of the cases cited. Based on this record, the district court\nconcluded that the evidence, at best, shows sporadic and isolated instances of\npossible violations. \"[T]hese occasional problems do not, without more, establish\na violation of the ADA.\" Midgett, 254 F. 3d at 850. Accordingly, the district\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in finding that Plaintiffs' evidence insufficient to\nsupport class-wide injunctive relief.\nD. Plaintiffs Failed to Show Factual Disputes, Which If Decided in\nTheir Favor, Would Establish Certain Elements of Their Prima\nFacie Case.\n1. The legal standards for Plaintiffs' claims under the ADA\nand Section 504.\nPlaintiffs' complaint alleges a cause of action arising under Title II of the\nADA (Title II) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (Section 504). Title II\nprohibits public entities from excluding a qualified individual with a disability\nfrom participating in programs or services offered by the entity. 28 U.S.C.\ni\n§ 12132. Section 504 imposes a similar prohibition against discrimination in any\nprogram receiving federal funding. 29 U.S.C. § 794. The elements of a cause of\n2O\n\naction are the same under both statutes,Rodriguez v. City of New York, 197 F. 3d\n611,618 (2d Cir. 1999), as is the standard for summary judgment. Zukle v.\nRegents of University of California, 166 F. 3d 1041, 1054 & n.11 (9th Cir. 1999).\nIn Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), the court held that \"unjustified\ninstitutional isolation of persons with disabilities is a form of discrimination.\" Id.\nat 600. Therefore, public entities may not discriminate against persons with\ndisabilities by requiring that they \"relinquish participation in community life they\ncould enjoy given reasonable accommodations.\" Id. at 601; see also 28 CFR\n§§ 41.51 (d), 35.130(d). However, the Court emphasized that responsibility\nimposed by anti-discrimination statutes \"is not boundless.\" Ohnstead, 527 U.S. at\n603. Title II does not \"impel States to phase out institutions, placing patients in\nneed of close care at risk.\" Id. at 605. Some persons with disabilities may require\ninstitutional placement to stabilize acute symptoms and for others \"no placement\noutside the institution may ever be appropriate.\" Therefore, \"Title II provides only\nthat qualified individuals with a disability may not be subjected to discrimination.\"\n/d. at 601-602.\nA state may rely on the reasonable assessments of its own professionals in\ndetermining whether an individual \"meets the essential eligibility requirements for\nhabilitation in a community-based program. Absent such qualification, it would\nbe inappropriate to remove a patient from the more restrictive setting.\"\n21\n\nld. (internal quotations and citations omitted.) Nor does federal law require\ncommunity placement of an individual who desires to remain in an institution. Id.\nFurthermore, the statutes prohibiting discrimination on the basis of\ndisability do not mandate immediate transfers of every individual whose treatment\nprofessionals have determined that community placement is appropriate. Title II\nregulations i'equire public entities only to make \"reasonable modifications in\npolicies, practices, or procedures\" and only when such modifications \"are\nnecessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability.\" 28 CFR\n§ 35.130(b)(7). In addition, such modifications are not required if\"the public\nentity can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter\nthe nature of the service, program, or activity.\" Id.\nThe Olmstead decision was careful to explain that a state's duty under Title\nII is limited by the resources available and the needs of other persons for whom\nthe state has responsibility, lal Ohnstead, the court reversed the Eleventh Circuit\nwhich had given \"an unduly restrictive\" reading of the defenses available to a state\nand instead fashioned a defense that permits a state to take into account its\nobligation to all disabled persons:\nSensibly construed, the fundamental-alteration component of\nthe reasonable-modifications regulation' would allow the State\nto show that, in the allocation of available resources, immediate\nrelief for the plaintiffs would be inequitable, given the\nresponsibility the State has undertaken for the care and\n22\n\ntreatment of alarge anddiverse population of persons with\nmental disabilities.\nId. at 597, 604.\nAs an example of how a state may meet its duty under Title II, the court\nexplained that a state would meet the reasonable modification standard if\"it had a\ncomprehensive, effectively working plan for placing qualified persons with mental\ndisabilities in less restrictive settings, and a waiting list that moved at a reasonable\npace not controlled by the state's endeavors to keep its institutions fully\npopulated .... \" Id. at 605-606.\nIn light of all of these qualifications, to establish a prima facie case under\nTitle II for discrimination based on alleged unjustified institutionalization,\nPlaintiffs must show: [1] the state's treatment professionals have determined that\ncommunity placement is appropriate, [2] the transfer from institutional care to a\nless restrictive setting is not opposed by the affected individual, [3] some act or\nomission of the state is causing the \"unjustified instituitonalization, and [4] the\nplacement can be reasonably accommodated, taking into account (a) the resources\navailable to the state and (b) the needs of others with mental disabilities.\nFrederick L. v. Department of Public Welfare, 364 F. 3d 487, 492 (3rd Cir. 2004)\n(citing Ohnstead, 527 U.S. at 587); see also Wong v. Regents of the University of\nCalifornia, 192 F. 3d 807, 816-17 (9th Cir. 1999).\n23\n\nAs explained below, the district court correctly found that Plaintiffs have\nnot raised factual issues which would defeat summary judgment on the third and\nfourth elements, and that the undisputed evidence establishes that Defendants have\nmet their burden of proving that Plaintiffs' proposed $1.4 billion annual increase\nin wages would constitute a fundamental alteration.\nIn addition to not establishing elements of their claim and failing to rebut\nthe fundamental alteration defense, Plaintiffs' analysis of Title II and § 504 is both\nincomplete and inaccurate. Plaintiffs' contention that \"federal law mandates\nCalifornia deinstitutionalize developmentally disabled except in limited\ncircumstances_\" (AOB, p. 45), doesviolence to the Supreme Court's careful\nanalysis in Olmstead which strengthened a state's defense to a\ndeinstitutionalization case. Additionally, Plaintiffs misapply the applicable burden\nwhen they argue that they must prevail unless the state can demonstrate that it has\na \"comprehensive plan\" and that \"provision of community based services will\n'fundamentally alter' the nature of the services.\" (AOB, p. 48.)\n2. Plaintiffs have not raised factual issues relating to a causal\nrelationship between wages and institutionalization.\nPlaintiffs contend that improper institutionalization has at its roots in the\ninsufficient wages and benefits allegedly paid employees of community-based\nproviders. Indeed, the class definition includes Plaintiffs' theory of causation.\n24\n\nThe class is defined as 1) all persons unnecessarily placed in institutions \"because\nthe wages and benefits of community-based direct care workers areinsufficient to\nsupport or make available sufficient, quality community based services... ,\" 2) all\npersons at \"risk of unnecessary institutionalization becausethe wages andbenefits\nof community based direct care workers threaten to close, terminate or render\n[community-based] services inadequate or of insufficient quality,\" and 3) all\npersons living with their family who are atrisk of unnecessary institutionalization\nfor the samereason. (ER 1/108/5-6.) Therefore, plaintiffs must show not only the\nexistence of unnecessary institutionalization asa system-wide problem, but that it\nis caused by inadequate wages andbenefits paid to community-based workers.\nCertainly none of the evidence cited by Plaintiffs establishes their theory of\ncausation. In fact, Plaintiffs have not identified to either the district court or this\nCourt a single person who is improperly institutionalized becauseof\"inadequate\"\nwages. The conclusory opinion by a regional center director to that effect is\ninsufficient to avoid summary judgment. Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation,\n497 U.S. 871,889 (1990); HalRoach Studies v. RichardFeinerand Co., 896 F. 2d\n1542, 1550-51 (9th Cir. 1990); Taylor v. List, 880 F. 2d 1040, 1045 (9th Cir.\n1989).\nPlaintiffs misstate the record in attempt to meet their burden on causation.\nThey contend that Defendants' CPP generates placements by \"authorizing rates\n25\n\nwhich average twice the usual community service rates and concomitantly, support\ntwice the direct care wages and benefits.\" (AOB, p. 52.) There is no evidence -\nincluding the declarations cited by Plaintiffs - in the record that supports this\nclaim. Neither Mr. Shorter nor Mr. Clark, both regional center directors, had any\ndata about wages paid by providers under the CPP process. Mr. Shorter merely\nassumed that because moving a consumer from a DC under the current CPP costs\ntwice what it cost during the 1990's, that the wages providers pay are double those\npaid under the existing rate structure. Similarly, Mr. Clark confirmed that he does\nnot have a quantitative basis for assessing the level of wages paid direct-care staff\nfor CPP placements, and that \"realistically\" it would be two or three years before\nthe regional center would have \"wage information to show any difference between\nactivities under the CPP and existing services delivery.\" (ER 7/213/4.) Thus, the\ntotal cost of a placement does not permit any conclusion about the rates paid to the\nprovider or the wages paid to the provider's staff. Mr. Clark acknowledged that\nthe increase of per client costs under the CPP is \"being driven by the services and\nsupports under the new CPP plan being provided to difficult to serve people in\nmore individualized, specialized settings.\" (ER 7/213/4-5.) Therefore, the\nadditional number of services needed by the difficult-to-serve persons who make\nup the remaining population in the DCs, and not substantially increased wages,\naccounts for the higher cost per placement of moving persons into the community\n26\n\npursuant to the CPP process. (SER 1/142; ER 6/186/4-6; ER 7/187/14; SER 1/90.)\nMoreover, just becauseDefendants have funded services necessary for\ndeinstitutionalization atrates outside the existing rate structure under § 4669.2,\ndoesnot establish that it is necessary in every case. The undisputed evidence is\nthat the CPP involves many additional measures that do not require that rates be\nincreased. Plaintiffs never identified a single consumer who was placed in a\ncommunity setting due to increased rates or wages.\n3. Plaintiffs cannot show that the accommodation they\npropose is a reasonable one.\nPlaintiffs' claim also founders on the requirement that their proposed\nremedy be areasonable one. The reasonableness of aparticular accommodation\n\"depends on the individual circumstances of eachcase\" and \"requires a fact-\nspecific, individualized analysis of the disabled individual's circumstances and the\naccommodations that might allow him to meet the program's standards.\" Wong,\n192 F. 3d at 818. Plaintiffs bear the initial burden of producing evidencethat a\nreasonable accommodation was possible. Vinson v. Thomas, 288 F. 3d 1145, 1154\n(9th Cir. 2002); Wong, 192 F. 3d at 816-17. The burden then shifts to defendants\nwho must establish that the requested relief would require a fundamental alteration\nof state policy. FrederickL., 364 F. 3d at 492 n. 4. Here, as explained in the\npreceding section and below, the district court properly found that Plaintiffs failed\n27\n\nto show that doubling the wages of community workers would achieve the result\nthey seek. (ER 10/253/41) Accordingly, Plaintiffs have failed to carry their\nburden of\"articulating areasonable accommodation.\"/d.\nThe district court found that Plaintiffs failed to meet this element of their\nprima facie case: \"Even if unjustified institutionalization is occurring, Plaintiffs\nhave failed to show that an increase in wages andbenefits for community-based\n\\\ndirect-care workers would remedy the alleged violation.\" Id. The recorddoes not\npermit any other conclusion. The history of placements demonstrate no\nrelationship between the rate of institutionalization and the level of wages and\nbenefits. California has placed over 40,000 persons in community settings under\nexisting rate and wage structures. (SER 1/6/144.) Defendants significantly\nreduced its institutional population in the 1990's without increases in wages and\nbenefits. (Id.) Under CPP, many consumers currently living in institutions will\nmove into the community as part of individualized plans directed to the specific\nneeds of each consumer. (ER 6/183/2-13.) Many of these consumers are being\nplaced in existing facilities, which are under the current rate structure.\n(ER 6/183/19, 24, 28, 31-36, 39-46.) Plaintiffs themselves concede that thousands\nof persons with difficult-to-serve needs receive care in the community under\nexisting wages and benefits. (AOB, pp. 54-55.)\n///\n28\n\nOn appeal, Plaintiff_ concede that doubling the wages of every worker is not\nrequired by the ADA. As a result, they now suggest that the reasonable\naccommodation they propose could be accomplished for less than $1.4 billion.\nThey make no effort to estimate the cost, but suggest that the state need only\nincrease the wages of those workers who would permit DC residents to move to\nthe community in order to comply with the ADA. (AOB, p. 58.) This argument is\nflawed. First, they never made it to the district court and they cannot raise it for\nthe first time on appealY Second, they do not identify these workers or explain\nhow the state is to identify those workers who should receive pay increases and\nwhich DC residents would be deinstitutionalized if the workers wages were\nincreased. Finally, under the state's current system, Defendants have the authority\nto go outside the rate structure. In short, Plaintiffs have not shown how their\nproposal differs or improves upon that system.\n4. Plaintiffs could not defeat Defendants' showing that they\nhave a comprehensive plan for deinstitutionalization.\nThe district court held that California's CPP is a comprehensive, effectively\nworking plan for deinstitutionalization under Olmstead. (ER 10/253/7-9, 45.)\nPlaintiffs fail to mention the CPP in their 13-page \"Statement of Facts\" despite the\n4 In response to Appellees's argument that the remedy constituted a\nfundamental alteration, Plaintiffs never argued that the cost of complying with the\nADA would be less than $1.4 billion per year. (ER 7/221/18-22.)\n29\n\nfact that the district court relied on the CPP in granting summary judgrnent.\n(AOB, p. 7-20.)\nThe undisputed evidence is that Defendants go to great lengths to ensure\nthat individuals have full services and supports in place so that transfers will be\nsuccessful, and to minimize the risk that placements will fail and consumers\nreadmitted to institutions. Even Plaintiffs' witnesses describe the CPP in glowing\nterms. (ER 8/238/3; ER 7/213/2.) In fact, oneof the agency Plaintiffs' directors\ntestified that Defendants' policies make it \"almost impossible\" to admit consumers\nto DCs. (SER 2/354-364.) Discouraging admissions in the first instance is one\nreason why 98% of California's 180,000 developmentally disabled consumers\nreside in the community; only 2% reside in DCs.\nIn light of this undisputed evidence, it is ludicrous to suggest that the CPP\ndoesnot meet the requirements of the Ohnstead decision because it is not called an\n\"Olmstead Plan.\" As the court in Frederick L., noted:\nThe issue is not whether there is a piece of paper that reflects\nthat there will be ongoing progress toward community\nplacement, but whether the Commonwealth has given\nassurance that there will be... [W]hat is needed at the very least\n•is a plan that is communicated in some manner. The District\nCourt accepted the Commonwealth's reliance on past progress\nwithout requiring a cormnitment by it to take all reasonable\nsteps to continue that progress.\n364 F. 3d at 500.\n3O\n\nIn contrast to Frederick L., California has demonstrated an ongoing\ncommitment to community placement in the CPP. California has done more than\ncommunicate their commitment, they have codified the CPP in statue. §§ 4418.2,\n4418.25, et seq. Moreover, California includes as a separate item in the\nGovernor's Budget supplemental dedicated funds which regional centers must\nspend only for implementing CPPs. § 4418.25; (SER 1/4/88-90; SER 1/2/35.)\nThis funding was increased by $20.5 million in the Governor's 2002-03 budget,\nrepresenting an increase of more than 60% over the previous budget specifically\nfor the CPP. (SER 1/6/151-152.) It is difficult to conceive what additional steps\nDefendants could take to communicate California's commitment to ongoing\nprogress toward deinstitutionalization.\nPlaintiffs' only other criticism of the CPP is the allegedly slow pace of\ntransferring consumers out of institutions. (AOB, p. 57.) However, Plaintiffs\nprovide scant evidence to dispute the record relied on by the district court in\nshowing that the recent slowdown in placements appears to be due to the complex\nmedical and behavioral issues of those who remain in institutions.\n(ER 10/253/41 :17-42; SER 1/6/i 42-143.) Their only argument is that there are\nlarge numbers of persons already in the community who have some of the same\ncomplications. The undisputed evidence is that consumers in institutions have, on\naverage, more, and more severe disabilities and very high level-of-care needs.\n31\n\n(SER 1/153-154.) Theseresidents are over four times more likely to have major\nmedical problems or be dependent upon life-sustaining technology, and six times\nmore likely to have severebehavior problems or unable to understand spoken\nwords. They areten times more likely to suffer from profound mental retardation\nor to have special conditions or severebehaviors. These consumers demand\ngreater quantities of more intensive care. (ld.) In addition, beginning in 1998,\ncourts began to find an increasing number of persons incompetent to stand trial\ndue to developmental disabilities. The resulting growth of the so-called \"forensic\"\npopulation offsets the number of discharges being made from institutions.\n(SER 1/142-143.) The effect is that while total caseloads grew by 71% during the\n1990s,the institutional population declined by 43%. (SER 1/6/142.) By 2000-\n2001, the statewide rate of institutionalization was half what it was ten years\nearlier. (SER 1/6/141/)\nThe district court referenced a similar finding in Williams v. Wasserman,\n164 F. Supp. 2d 591 (D. Md. 2001). In Wasserman, the court held that Maryland's\n\"progress in placing members of the [institutionalized] population into the\ncommunity has been acceptable\" because \"the defendants' efforts to provide a\nstable, safe, and caring environment [ ] were genuine and commendable, if not\nalways successful.\" ld. at 633. (ER 10/253/42.)\nIn Frederick L., appellants there also claimed that deinstitutionalization had\n32\n\nslowed impermissibly. The court concluded that \"cost constraints make it\ninappropriate for us to direct DPW to develop 60 community residential slots per\nyear .... \" 364 F. 3d at 500.\nCalifornia committed over $50 million in 2002/2003 specifically to place\ninstitutional residents in the community. The CPP allocated as much as $286,000\nfor the first year that a consumer is discharged from a DC and averages nearly\n$102,000 per year per consumer to maintain community placements after the first\nyear. (SER 1/96.) None of the evidence cited by Plaintiffs would support a\nconclusion that these efforts were not genuine, comprehensive and reasonable.\n5. Plaintiffs have not overcome Defendants' evidence that the\nproposed remedy would constitute a fundamental\nalteration.\nThe district court found that Plaintiffs' remedy - a $1.4 billion per year\nincrease in reimbursementrates -- would fundamentally alter California's service\ndelivery system for consumers. (ER 10/253/43-44.) The court noted that \"a forty\npercent increase in the state's total budgetary allocation for spending on programs\nthat serve cofisumers - is plainly a fundamental alteration under the analysis\nprovided by the Supreme Court .... Ordering such a drastic re-allocation of ,\nresources would be inequitable.\" (ER 10/253/43-44.)\nUnder Olmstead, courts must recognize the state's need to \"maintain a range\nof facilities for the care and treatment of persons with diverse mental disabilities,\"\n33\n\nand its obligation \"to administer services with aneven hand.\" 527 U.S. at 597.\nThus,\n[I]n evaluating a fundamental-alteration defense, the [court]\nmust consider, in view of the resources available to the State,\nnot only the cost of providing community-based care to the\nlitigants, but also the range of services the State provides others\nwith mental disabilities, and the State's obligation to mete out\nthose services equitably.\nId. at 604.\nThe district court properly assessed whether Plaintiffs' proposed\naccommodation constitu_;es a fundamental alteration of existing programs, and\nfound that it would require a significant restructuring of the State's existing\nprograms and services, in light of existing budgetary constraints and the\ncompeting demands of other services that the state provides. (ER 10/253/42-44.)\nThe $1.4 billion per year \"remedy\" proposed by Plaintiffs, a figure that\nrepresented over 40 percent of the State's $2.2 billion annual budget for\ncommunity programs that serve individuals with developmental disabilities, would\nimpose a massive and unprecedented reallocation of the state's fiscal resources.\nAlthough the result could certainly benefit employees in community-based\nfacilities serving these consumers, the funds would have to be diverted from other\nrecipients of state funding. Such a real location would necessitate the elimination\nor reduction of many important services and programs. (SER 1/143-149.)\n34\n\nUnable to dispute the substantial detrimental effect of such areallocation,\nPlaintiffs focused almost entirely on alleged \"untapped federal dollars\" in their\nclaim that billions of dollars could be recouped from the 50% reimbursement the\nfederal Medicaid agency pays to the Medi-Cal program. Defendants' evidence\ndemonstrated the fallacy of Plaintiffs' claim, and Plaintiffs failed to produce\ncontrary evidence. (ER 7/187/11-12; ER 7/184/3.) Plaintiffs' experts only\ntestified that California relies more heavily on state funds than other states; they\nadmitted they do not know how many of California's recipients would qualify for\nadditional federal funding or the amount of funding that would be generated.\n(ER 2/166/28.) The undisputed evidence is that California's system is very\ndifferent than other statesin providing services that do not quality for federal\nreimbursement. (SER 1/2/36; SER 1/6/152.) California could match the federal\nreimbursement levels of other states,but only by reducing services, or the number\nof consumers served. (SER 1/6/152-153.)\nIn any event, the possibility of increased federal reimbursements is\nirrelevant to the analysis. As held in Ohnstead, it is the state's budget for services\nto persons with mental disabilities that courts must use to determine whether an\naccommodation is a fundamental alteration. In Frederick L., plaintiffs argued that\nthe state could have sought additional sums from other sources to fund additional\ncommunity placements. The court found review of that issue to be beyond judicial\n35\n\nscrutiny. Id. at 496-497. Accordingly, the potential for additional federal\nreimbursement is irrelevant as to whether Plaintiffs' proposed accommodation\nwould fundamentally alter Defendants' programs.\nII. THE DISTRICT COURT CORRECTLY HELD THAT PLAINTIFFS\nDO NOT HAVE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION UNDER 42 U.S.C.\nSECTION 1983 TO ENFORCE SECTION 1396a(a)(30)(A) OF THE\nMEDICAID ACT _/\nA. Plaintiffs Have Abandoned Their Argument That Medicare\nProviders Can Enforce Section 1396a(a)(30)(A) under 42 U.S.C.\nSection 1983.\nThe Plaintiffs in this case include providers of Medicaid services and\nMedicaid recipients. In the district court, Plaintiffs asserted that both could\nenforce § 1396a(a)(30)(A) by means of 42 U.S.C. § 1983. On appeal, the\nPlaintiffs have abandon their argument that providers have such a right of action.\n(AOB, p. 29.) Accordingly, the issue before this Court is limited to whether\nrecipients can maintaina § 1983 claim to enforce § (30)(A).\n//\n//\n//\n//\n5 Because the district court dismissed the Medicaid claim on a motion for\njudgment on the pleadings, the standard of review is de novo. Torbet v. United\nAirlines, Inc., 298 F. 3d 1087, 1089 (9th Cir. 2002).\n36\n\nB. A Plaintiff Can Maintain an Action to Enforce a Federal Statue\nunder Section 1983 Only Where Congress's Intent to Confer an\nIndividual Right Is Unambiguous.\n1. Applicable legal principles.\nIn 2002, the Supreme Court in Gonzaga University v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273\n(2002) clarified the principles to be applied in determining whether a federal\nstatute enacted pursuant to Congress's spending power confers individual rights\nenforceable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The Court began by confirming that private\nenforcement of Spending Clause statutes is the rare exception. \"'In legislation\nenacted pursuant to the spending power, the typical remedy for state\nnoncompliance with federally imposed conditions is not a private cause of action\nfor noncompliance but rather action by the Federal Government to terminate funds\nto the State.'\" Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 280, quoting Pennhurst State School and\nHospital v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 28 (1981). Therefore, \"unless Congress\n'speaks with a clear voice' and manifests an 'unambiguous' intent to confer\nindividual rights, federal funding provisions provide no basis for private\nenforcement by § 1983. (Citation omitted.).'_ Id.\nThe Court next addressed the \"confusion\" which had led some courts to\nmisinterpret its prior decisions, including Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329\n(1997), as endorsing a less stringent standard. In Blessing, the Court had\nformulated a three-factor test to evaluate whether Congress had conferred an\n37\n\nenforceable right: (l) Congress must have intended that the statutory provision in\nquestion to benefit the plaintift, (2) the right must not be so \"vague and\namorphous\" as to be \"beyond the competence of the judiciary to enforce;\" and (3)\nthe statute \"must be couched in mandatory, rather than precatory terms.\" 520 U.S.\nat 340-41. While not abandoning the test, the Gonzaga Court dispelled any\nsuggestion that the first Blessing factor stood for the proposition that\nCongressional intent to permit enforcement under § 1983 will be found \"so long as\nthe plaintiff falls within the general zone of interest that the statute is intended to\nprotect. ''6J Id. at 283. That the statute \"benefits\" the plaintiff is insufficient- the\nprovision must unambiguously create a right:\nWe now reject the notion that our cases permit anything short\nof an unambiguously conferred right to support a cause of\naction brought under § 1983. Section 1983 provides a remedy\nonly for the deprivation of \"rights, privileges, or immunities\nsecured by the Constitution and laws\" of the United States.\nAccordingly, it is rights, not the broader or vaguer \"benefits\" or\n\"interests\" that may be enforced under the authority of that\nsection. (Emphasis original.)\nId.\nMoreover, because only rights may be enforced, the Court's implied right of\naction cases \"should guide the determination of whether a statute confers rights\n6 See 31 Foster Children v. Bush, 329 F. 3d 1255, 1269-1270 (1 lth Cir.\n2003) (\"The Supreme Court in Gonzaga clarified the first of the Blessing\nrequirements.\").\n38\n\nenforceable under § 1983.\" Id.\nAs Gonzaga explains, under the private fight of action cases, the \"text and\nstructure\" of the statute must demonstrate that Congress unambiguously intended\nto grant individual fights. 536 U.S. at 286. Critical to this inquiry is whether the\nstatutory provision uses \"rights-creating\" language. 536 U.S. at 287; Alexander v.\nSandoval, 532 U.S. 275,288-289 (2001). Such language must clearly impart an\n\"individual entitlement,\" and have an \"unmistakable focus on the benefitted\nclass.\" /d.; Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 692, n. 13 (1979)\n(text of statute must be \"phrased in terms of the person benefitted.\") \"Statutes that\nfocus on the person regulated rather than the individuals protected create no\nimplication of an intent to confer rights on a particular class of person.\" (internal\nquotes and citation omitted). Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 287, quoting Alexander v.\nSandoval, 532 U.S. at 289. \"If [the statute] provide[s] some indication that\nCongress may have intended to create individual fights, and some indication it\nmay not have, that means Congress has not spoken with the requisite 'clear voice.'\nAmbiguity precludes enforceable rights.\" 31 Foster Children, 329 F. 3d 1255,\n1270 (1 lth Cir. 2003). The Gonzaga Court invoked as exemplars of\"rights-\ncreating\" language Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. § 2000d)\nand Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). Each of\nthose statutes provides: \"No person in the United States shall.., be subject to\n39\n\ndiscrimination.\" According to Gonzaga, this language creates individual rights\nbecause it is phrased \"with an unmistakable focus on the benefitted class.\" 536\nU.S. at 284 (quoting Cannon, 441 U.S. at 691) (emphasis original).\nAdditional closely related principles relevant to determining whether the\ntext and structure of a statutory provision manifest a congressional intent to confer\nan enforceable right include: (1) statutes that have an \"aggregate\" focus rather\nihan a focus upon whether the needs of any particular person has been satisfied do\nnot give rise to individual rights; (2) statutes that speak only in terms of\ninstitutional policy and practice do not evince an intent to create private rights of\nenforcement; (3) a statutory provision that references the individual only in the\ncontext of describing the type of policy or practice that will trigger a funding\nprohibition, does not reflect a congressional intent to create a private right of\naction; and (4) a provision that allows a state entity to avoid a loss of federal funds\nthrough substantial compliance reflects a congressional intent to confer group\nrather than individual rights. Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 288.\nApplication of all these principles demonstrates that § (30)(A) does not\nunambiguously confer rights on Medicare recipients.\n2. Section (30)(A) does not contain rights-creating language.\nThe Medicaid Act was enacted pursuant to Congress's spending power to\nhelp states provide medical care for the poor and disabled. To be eligible for\n40\n\nfederal Medicaid funds, 42 U.S.C. § 1396 requires that the statesubmit, andhave\napproved by the Secretary, aplan for medical assistance,i.e., a \"comprehensive\nwritten statement\" that describes the nature and scope of the state's Medicaid\nProgram. See 42 C.F.R. § 430.10. See Evergreen Presbyterian Ministries, Inc. v.\nHood, 235 F. 3d 908,915, n.2 (5th Cir. 2000). The required components of a state\nplan are set forth in 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a), (attached at Tab B). Section\n1396a(a)(30)(A) addresses the standards the state is to employ in setting payment\nrates for providers of care and services under the plan:\nA state plan for medical assistance must.., provide for such\nmethods and procedures relating to the utilization of, and the\npayment for, care and services available under the plan.., as\nmay be necessary to safeguard against unnecessary utilization\nof such care and services and to assure that payments are\nconsistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care and are\nsufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services\nare available under the plan at least to the extent that such care\nand services are available to the general population in the\ngeographic area.\nThe district court held that § (30)(A) does not contain rights-creating\nlanguage which is critical to finding the requisite congressional intent to create a\nprivate, enforceable right:\nThere can be little doubt that § 30(A) fails to employ the \"no\nperson shall\" language cited by the Gonzaga Court as the\nepitome of rights-creating language. Id. at 287. Textually,\n§ 30(A) is phrased in terms of what a State plan for medical\nassistance must provide to administrators and recipients of\nTitle XIX services. While § 30(A) benefits both recipients and\n41\n\nproviders of Title XIX services, the language of the statute\ndoes not clearly confer an enforceable right on either. Gonzaga\nhas made clear that the effect of conferring a benefit is not\nenough to warrant a private right enforceable by § 1983.\"\nSanchez v. Johnson, 301 F. Supp. 2d 1060, 106'3 (9th Cir. 2004).\nThe district court's analysis is correct. There is nothing in the text of §\n(30)(A) that speaks to individual entitlement, or that unmistakably focuses on\nrecipients. As the district court noted, there is no language even remotely\ncomparable in its individual focus to the \"No person shall be subject to\ndiscrimination\" provision in Title VI and Title IX, which the Supreme Court held\nout as examples of the type of language that demonstrates an unambiguous\nCongressional intent to confer individual rights. Instead, § (30)(A) establishes\nwhat factors are to guide the state in providing for \"methods and procedures\nrelating to\" provider rates. That is, the state must set rates based on an assessment\nas to whether they achieve certain broad results, i.e., rates that are consistent with\nefficiency, economy and quality, and that ensure access to services comparable to\nthe general population.\nThus, Plaintiffs' argument that the provisions of § (30)(A) which they seek\nto enforce were included in the statute \"to protect the interests of service\nbeneficiaries\" ignores the text and structure of the statute. (AOB, p. 30-31.)\nSection (30)(A) reveals an intent to assure that states protect the sometimes\n42\n\ncompeting interests of anumber of groups. For instance, the most efficient and\neconomical system may serve the interests of taxpayers, but only to the\ndisadvantage of medical providers. Similarly the interests of recipients in access\ncomparable to the general population a statemay be in conflict with the objective\nof efficiency, economy andquality. The tension between theseobjectives further\nunderscores the conclusion that § (30)(A) is concerned with overall methodology\nrather than conferring rights on individual recipients. Furthermore, by parsing out\nparticular words and phrases in § (30)(A) and treating them as separately\nenforceable obligations, Plaintiffs ignore the overall directive of the statute. The\ntortured reading Plaintiffs must give to the statute demonstrates that the provision\ndoes not clearly and unambiguously bestow a enforceable right on any specific\ngroup. This argument fails because, even as framed by Plaintiffs, it claims no\nmore than that the \"quality\" and \"access\" provisions serve the interest of and\nbenefit recipients. However, as Gonzaga makes abundantly clear \"it is rights, not\nthe broader or vaguer \"benefits\" or \"interests\" that may be enforced under the\nauthority of[§ 1983].\" (Emphasis original.) Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283.\nEven if one accepts for purposes of argument that the \"quality of care\" and\n\"access\" provisions constitute stand-alone requirements, the fact that a statute is\ncast in mandatory, rather than precatory, terms does not, in itself, demonstrate a\nCongressional !ntent to confer rights on recipients. Mandatory provisions create\n43\n\nlaw binding on stateschoosing to accept Medicaid funding, but whether those\nprovisions confer enforceable rights on recipients is aseparate question.\nGonzaga, 526 U.S. at 283 (\"It is only the violation of rights, not laws, which give\nrise to § 1983 actions.\"); see also Sabree v. Richman,367 F. 3d 180, 187 (3d Cir.\n2004). A fnding that rights have been conferred requires a showing that the\nstandards articulated in Gonzaga - most critically the use of rights-creating\nlanguage - have been met. Plaintiffs have not, and cannot, make that showing.\nNor is Plaintiffs' argument, based on the supposed link between § (30)(A)\nand §§ 1396a(a)(8) and (a)(10), persuasive. Section (a)(10) requires that the state\n\"provide... medical assistance.., to... all [eligible] individuals.\" Section\n(a)(8) requires that the state \"provide... assistance.., with reasonable\npromptness to all eligible individuals.\" In Sabree, the Third Circuit held that these\nsections demonstrate a Congressional intent to confer individual rights because\nthey use rights-creating language, i.e., the text enumerates entitlements available\nto \"all eligible individuals\"; they are not focused on the entity regulated; and they\ndo not reference the individual in the context of describing the type of policy or\npractice that will trigger a funding prohibition. Id. at 190. Although the\nDefendants disagree with the Third Circuit finding that §§ (a)(8) and (a)(10)\nsatisfy Gonzaga, the text of § (30)(A) has none of the rights-creating language and\nfocus on enumerated entitlements to individual recipients that arguably\n44\n\ncharacterize the text of §9 (a)(8) and (a)(10). Section (30)(A) must, by its terms,\nconfer aright; it cannot ride on the coattails of other sections of the Medicaid Act.\n42 U.S.C. section 1320a-2 does not provide the rights-\nao\ncreating language required by Gonzaga.\nIn an effort to overcome what they concede is a lack of\"classic rights-\ncreating language\" in § (30)(A), Plaintiffs rely on 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-2, which they\nincorrectly dub \"the Suter v. Artist M. override provision.\" (AOB, pp. 32-33.)\nThis reliance is niisplaced.\nIn Suter v. Artist M., 503 U.S. 347 (1992), the Supreme Court held that a\nclass of parents and children could not maintain an action under § 1983 to enforce\nprovisions of the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act (a portion of the\nSocial Security Act), which requires that states have a \"plan\" to make \"reasonable\nefforts\" to keep children out of foster homes. See 42 U.S.C. § 617(a)(3), (15). In\nresponse to Suter, Congress enacted § 1320a-27/, which states:\nIn an action brought to enforce a provision of this chapter, such\nprovision is not to be deemed unenforceable because of its\ninclusion in a section Of this chapter requiring a State plan or\nspecifying the required contents of a State plan. This section is\nnot intended to limit or expand the grounds for determining the\navailability of private actions to enforce State plan\nrequirements other than by overturning any such grounds\napplied in Surer..., but not applied in prior Supreme Court\ndecisions respecting such enforceability; provided, however,\n7 At the same time, and probably mistakenly, Congress passed a second,\nidentical statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-10.\n5 .,\n\nthat this section is not intended to alter the holding in Suter v.\nArtist M. that section 671 (a)(l 5) of this title is not enforceable\nin a private right of action. (Emphasis added.)\nWhile the language of this provision is, at best, oblique, Congress was apparently\ntrying to achieve three objectives: (1) to ensure that enforcement under § 1983 is\nnot foreclosed on the sole ground that the provision at issue specifies the content\nof a state plan, (2) to ensure that plaintiffs may seek enforcement under § 1983 to\nthe same extent they could prior to Suter, _-/and (3) to confirm that there was no\nintent tOalter the specific holding in Surer.\nPlaintiffs assert that § 1392a-2 excuses the requirement that a statutory\nprovision must contain rights-creating language to be enforceable via § 1983.\n(AOB, p. 33-34.) However, the conclusion that plaintiffs seek to draw simply\ndoes not follow logically from § 1392a-2. The fact that private enforcement is not\nforeclosed because a provision deals with a state plan does not lead to the\nconclusion that a provision is enforceable because it is in a state plan. Section\n1392a-2 only stops a court from, in effect, saying that because § 1396a(a) governs\nstate plan requirements, it must be concluded that Congress did not intend any of\n§ 1396a(a)'s subsections to create private rights of action. As a matter of logic,\nprecluding this single rationale does not excuse a court, when assessing a\n8 See Harris v. James, 127 F. 3d 993, 1003 (1 lth Cir. 1997); Messier v.\nSouthbury Training School, 916 F. Supp. 133, 144 (D. Conn. 1996) (finding\n\"courts should apply the Wilder framework, unmodified by Suter\").\n46\n\nprovision of the Social Security Act relating to stateplans, from applying the\nprinciples explained in Gonzaga in order to discern Congress's intent. 2/\nThis conclusion is supported by § 1392a-2 itself. The section's second\nsentence affirms that the law governing rights of action under § 1983, unmodified\nby any grounds of decision unique to Suter, was to remain in effect. According to\nGonzaga, Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Ass 'n, 496 U.S. 498 (1990), the last § 1983\nenforcement case before Suter, found that the now-repealed Boren Amendment\ncould be enforced under § 1983 because \"Congress left no doubt of its intent for\nprivate enforcement.\" Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 280-81. Thus, the need to show an\nunambiguous congressional intent to confer a right was a requirement before\nSuter. Moreover, there is nothing in § 1392a-2 which freezes the law as it existed\npre-Suter. Thus, so long as the Supreme Court does not rely on unspecified\ngrounds unique to Suter, § 1392a-2 does not stop the Court from developing and\nmodifying the principles governing enforceability under § 1983. Therefore, even\nif Gonzaga is interpreted as altering the analysis employed in Wilder - a position\nwhich plaintiffs reject (AOB, p. 29) - Gonzaga is fully applicable here.\n///\n9 Apart from the district court's decision in Clayworth v. Bonta, 295 F.\nSupp. 2nd 1110 (E.D. Cal. 2003), Defendants are not aware of any case which has\ninterpreted § 1392a-2 as affecting the application of Gonzaga. For example, the\nThird Circuit in Sabree, although not addressing § 1392a-2, never questioned that\n§§ (a)(8), (a)(10), and (a)(15) were to be analyzed under Gonzaga.\n47\n\nFinally, it is important to stressthat the district court did not baseits finding\nofunenforceability on the fact that § (30)(A) specifies the contents of a state plan.\nConsequently, Plaintiffs cannot, and do not, contend that the district court violated\nthe express mandate of § 1392a-2. Instead, they are complaining that the court did\nnot rely on § 1392a-2 as a basis for disregarding the lessons of Gonzaga.\nSection (30)(A) has an aggregate rather than an individual\no\nfocus.\nIn addition to finding no rights-creating language, the district court correctly\nconcluded that § (30)(A) has an aggregate, rather than the required individual,\nfOCUS:\nThe statute speaks, not of any individual's right, but of the\nState's obligation to develop 'methods and procedures' of\nproviding medical services. Indeed, the only mention of\nrecipients of Title xIX services is in the aggregate, as \"the\ngeneral population in the geographic area. (Citation omitted.)\nA statutory provision that refers to the individual only in the\ncontext of describing a State policy or practice does not reflect\na congressional intent to create a private right of action.\nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 287.\nSanchez, 301 F. Supp.2d at 1064.\nThe district court was certainly correct in emphasizing that the focus on\n\"methods and procedures\" coupled with the virtual absence of language directed at\nrecipients supports the conclusion that § (30)(A) is framed in aggregate terms.\nThis is obviously true for the \"efficiency, economy, and quality of care\" portion of\n48\n\n§ (30)(A). Likewise, the court, in assessingthe language relating to \"access,\"\ncorrectly found that although there is areference to \"recipients,\" that reference is\nnot reflective of acongressional intent to create private tights because it is made in\nthe context of describing the state's policy objective of achieving accessfor\nrecipients comparable to the general population in the geographic area.\nPlaintiffs contend that the district court's analysis \"overlooks the similarity\nof § (30)(A) andthe [now-repealed] Boren Amendment atissue in Wilder\" (AOB,\np. 34). However, even the Clayworth decision, upon which Plaintiffs so heavily\nrely, rejects this comparison. 295 F. Supp. 2d at 1121-22 (finding that \"[t]he\nlanguage of Section 30(A) is not the same as that of the Boren Amendment.\").\nLikewise, the Fifth and Third Circuits have rejected plaintiffs' argument. See Pa.\nPharmacists Ass 'n v. Houstoun, 283 F. 3d 531,538 (3d Cir. 2002) (en banc);\nEvergreen Presbyterian Ministries, Inc. v. Hood, 235 F. 3d 908, 926-928 (5th Cir.\n2000). These decisions are correct. The Boren Amendment, unlike § (30)(A),\nexplicitly conferred objective monetary entitlements upon individual health\nproviders. Gonzaga at 536 U.S. at 280. This fact persuaded the Court that the\nAmendment was enforceable. Id. Section (30)(A) does not confer comparable,\nobjectively ascertainable entitlements on individual recipients.\nPlaintiffs also rely on Clayworth's erroneous conclusion that § (30)(A) is\n\"not phrased in aggregate or indirect terms - such as requiting a general policy or\n49\n\nrequiring substantial compliance - that might suggest that no single beneficiary is\nentitled to quality care or equal access.\" (AOB, p. 35, citing Clayworth, 295 F.\nSupp. 2d at 1122.) The reasoning of the district court in this case on the\n\"aggregate\" issue is better reasoned• Contrary to Clayworth, § (30)(A) does have\nan aggregate focus in that it establishes general policies and objectives for setting\nrates for all Medicaid providers. As the district court noted, there is no affirmative\nlanguage directed at providing benefits to recipients in their individual capacity.\nMoreover, Clayworth is incorrect in finding that § (30)(A) is not satisfied by the\nstate's substantial compliance with its requirements. 42 U.S.C. § 1396c authorizes\nthe Secretary of HHS to suspend payments to a state if the state fails to \"comply\nsubstantially\" with the requirements of Title XIX:\nIf the Secretary, after reasonable notice and opporttmity for a\nhearing to the State agency administering or supervising the\nadministration of the State plan approved under this title finds\n•.. that in the administration of the plan there is afailure to\ncomply substantially with a_O,such provision; the Secretary\nshall notify such State agency that further payment will not be\nmade to the State..., until the Secretary is satisfied that there\nwill no longer be any such failure to comply.\n42 U.S.C. §1396c (emphasis added)•\nAs explained in Blessing, the substantial compliance standard \"is simply a\nyardstick for the Secretary to measure the systemwide performance of a state's...\nprogram. Thus, the Secretary must look to the aggregate services provided by the\n50\n\nstate, not to whether the needs of any particular person have been satisfied.\"\nBlessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. at 343; see also Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 281-82.\nAccordingly, the \"substantial compliance\" provision here, as in Gonzaga and\nBlessing, counsel against a finding of an unambiguously conferred individual\nright.\n4. Plaintiffs' Other Arguments Do Not Support the\nConclusion that Section (30)(A) is enforceable.\nPlaintiffs also argue that the lack of an administrative review procedure to\nchallenge alleged violations of § (30)(A) supports the existence of an enforceable\nright. (AOB, p. 28.) Gonzaga had cited the fact that FERPA established an\nadministrative process as buttressing the conclusion that Congress meant to\npreclude private enforcement. 536 U.S. at 289. However, whether an\nadministrative procedure exists is not determinative of whether a provision is\nprivately enforceable. See 31 Foster Children, 329 F. 3d 1272-73 (finding that\n\"lack of an enforcement mechanism by which an aggrieved individual can obtain\nreview is but one of the factors\" to be considered, and that this factor was\noutweighed by the fact that the pertinent provisions of the Adoption Act did not\nhave individually focused, rights-creating language and employed a substantial\ncompliance standard.). The same reasoning applies here.\n///\n51\n\nPlaintiffs' argument based on purported legislative history must also be\nrejected. The cited legislative doesnot relate to §(30)(A). (AOB, p. 35-36, citing\nHouse of Representatives Report 97-158, Vol. II at 312-313.) This history was\nerroneously cited by the Third Circuit in Pennsyh,ania Pharmacists and the\ndistrict court in Clayworth to support the conclusion that § (30)(A) was intended\nto confer rights on Medicaid recipients. Although Congress did amend § (30)(A)\nin 1981, the passage cited by Plaintiffs actually relates to a proposed amendment\nto the \"freedom of choice\" provision, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23). _ Plaintiffs cited\nthis same passage in their opposition to Defendants' motion for reconsideration in\nthe district court, and Defendants' addressed the error in their reply brief.\n(S ER 5/31/1404-1412.) Plaintiffs do not respond to this point in their brief to this\nCourt, but instead continue to cite this legislative history instead of\nacknowledging that it is not applicable.\nPlaintiffs cite numerous pre- and post-Gonzaga cases, claiming that no\nappellate court has held that recipients cannot privately enforce § (30)(A) under §\n10 The passage referred to is a section of the report entitled \"Competitive\nArrangements for Payment for Laboratory Services, Medical Devices and Drugs\"\nand proposed amendments to the \"freedom of choice\" requirement. The House\nversion of the amendment was later amended in conference committee. H.R.\nConf. Rep. 97-208 at p. 936. The final version was enacted in section 2174 of\nPublic Law 97-35. The committee report to the actual amendment of § (30)(A)\nappears at 312-313 and makes no reference to its enforceability. In fact, the\namendment had to do with deleting certain language to \"remove administrative\nburdens\" and \"increase flexibility for the States.\n52\n\n1983. While this is technically accurate with regard to the First Circuit decision in\nLong Term Care Pharmac), Alliance v. Ferguson, the court's reasoning regarding\nwhy § 1396a(a)(30)(A) does not create a private right of action in providers\napplies equally to recipients. 362 F. 3d 50 (1st Cir. 2004). \"[S]ubsection (30)(A)\nhas much broader coverage [compared to current subsection (13)(A)], sets forth\ngeneral objectives, and mentions no category of entity or person specially\nprotected.\" Id. at 56. In rejecting plaintiff's suggestion that failure to provide a\nprivate right of action would render the provision a \"nullity,\" the court found that\nthe \"Secretary has ample authority to enforce subsection (30)(A)\" by\n\"disapproving a state plan and cutting off funds.\" Id. The court also compared §\n(30)(A) with the point favoring the result in Gonzaga cited by Justice Breyer-\nthat \"'much of the statute's key [substantive] language is broad and nonspecific,'\nsuggesting that exclusive agency enforcement might fit the scheme better than a\nplethora of private actions threatening disparate outcomes.\" Id. at 58.\n\"Subsection (30)(A) presents the same concern. The criteria (avoiding overuse,\nefficiency, quality of care, geographic equality) are highly general and potentially\nin tension. And read literally, the statute does not make these directly applicable\nto individual state decisions; rather state plans are to provide \"methods and\nprocedures\" to achieve these general ends.\" Id. (citation omitted). This\ndescription of the provision applies to both providers and recipients, and leads to\n53\n\nonly one conclusion: neither has aprivate right to enforce § (30)(A).\nPlaintiffs citations to pre-Gonzaga casesare irrelevant asto whether under\nGonzaga § (30)(A) the provision is privately enforceable by recipients. (In fact,\nonly one case held that the provision was enforceable by recipients. See\nEvergreen Presbyterian Ministries, Inc., 235 F. 3d at 928-29. The post-Gonzaga\ndistrict court cases cited by Plaintiffs also do not establish congressional intent\nthat Medicaid recipients have a private right of enforcement. The rights of\nrecipients to enforce § (30)(A) were not even at issue in American Soc 'y of\nConsultant Pharmacists v. Concannon, 214 F. Supp. 2d 23, 30 (D. Maine 2002).\nIn that case, the court held that providers did have a private right of action, citing\nVisiting Nuse Ass 'n v. Bullen, 93 F. 3d 997 (lst Cir. 1996)because \"Bullen is the\nFirst Circuit's last, clear word on the subject and the Court is bound to follow it.\"\nId. at 30. However, the court acknowledged that \"Bullen's continued viability\npost-Gonzaga_is in some doubt.\" Id. at 29.\nPlaintiffs' reliance on Association of Residential Resources of Minnesota\n(ARRM) v. Minnesota Comm 'r of Human Services, 2003 WL 22037719 (D. Minn.\n2003) is also misplaced because \"the ARRM court arrived at its holding without\ndiscussing the factors articulated by the Supreme Court in Gonzaga\" as the district\ncourt here correctly found. Sanchez, 301 F. Supp. 2d at 1064. The only district\ncourt to hold that recipients can enforce § 1396a(a)(30)(A) under § 1983 is\n54\n\nClayworth, which is on appeal. In Clayworth, the court primarily relied on 42\nU.S.C. § 1320a-2 to find that § (30)(A) was enforceable by recipients, but not\nproviders. If not for this faulty analysis, the court would likely not have\nconcluded that the provision was enforceable by recipients. Therefore, Plaintiffs'\nreliance on Clavworth here should be rejected.\nC. Tile \"Efficiency, Economy, and Quality of Care\" Provision of\nSection (30)(A) Is Too Vague and Amorphous to Be Judicially\nEnforced.\nUnder the second Blessing factor, it must be determined whether the\nstatutory provision is \"too vague and amorphous\" to be judicially enforceable_ /\nPlaintiffs cannot rely on Orthopaedic Hosp. v. Belshe, 103 F. 3d 1491 (9th Cir.\n1997) because the issue of whether § 1396a(a)(30)(A) is enforceable under Sectio\n1983 was sub silento in Orthopaedic, and should not be considered here. Hagans\nv. Levine, 415 U.S. 528, 535 (1974) (ruling \"when questions of jurisdiction have\nbeen passed on in prior decisions sub silento this Court has never considered itself\nbound when a subsequent case finally brings the jurisdictional issue before us\").\nThus, Orthopaedic has no pi'ecedential value here.\nPlaintiffs' reliance on the language of the now repealed Boren Amendment\nis equally misplaced. The Boren Amendment required states to adopt rules that\n_l Given its finding of no congressional intent to confer a right, the district\ncourt, like the Gonzaga Court, did not address this factor.\n55\n\n\"the Statefinds, and makes assurancessatisfactory to the Secretary, are reasonable\nand adequate\" to achieve identified objectives. (e.g., \"meet the costs of efficiently\nandeconomically operated facilities.\") SeeMethodist Hosps. v. Sullivan, 91 F. 3d\n1026; 1030 (7th Cir. 1996). By contrast, the\"economy, efficiency, and quality of\ncare\" provision of § (30)(A) does not even mention provider costs and contains no\nindication that Congress intended that states were to establish a rate that\ncompensates a minimum portion of the efficient and economic cost of providing\nquality care for each of thousands of different outpatient medical services and\nitems.\nThat the Secretary took action concerning the home and community-based\nwaiver shows only that the Secretary, in his/her capacity as an executive branch\nadministrator and monitor, is performing as authorized by the Act. It does not\nestablish that § (30)(A) sets standards that are sufficiently objective to be enforced\nby the judicial branch.\nThe only two courts to considered the issue have found the \"efficiency,\neconomy, and quality of care\" provision so vague and amorphous as not to be\njudicially enforceable. See Florida Pharmacy Ass 'n v. Cook, 17 F. Supp. 2d 1293\n(N:D. Fla. 1998) in which the court found that the \"efficiency, economy, and\nquality of care\" provision \"provides no benchmark or guidance for determining\nwhether any particular approach is 'efficient,' no standard for addressing\n56\n\n'economy,\"no suggestion of how much 'quality' is enough. These are goals for\nwhich the state must strive, but they are not standards a court can enforce.\" Id. at\n1300 (emphasis added); see also Fulkerson v. Commissioner, 802 F. Supp. 529,\n534-35 (D. Me. 1992) (finding that the \"competing goals\" of\"keeping Medicaid\ncosts as low as possible\" and \"providing quality of care to Medicaid recipients\"\n\"requires specified knowledge of the workings of the health care system and the\nexercise of significant administrative discretion in allocating scare fiscal\nresources\" such that it is a \"task for which the Secretary, not the courts, is\nuniquely qualified\").\nThe decisions in Florida Pharmacy and Fulkerson are consistent with the\nposition taken by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) that\nthe provision is not judicially enforceable. With regard to a petition for certiorari\ni\nthat California filed requesting review of the Ninth Circuit's decision in\nOrthopaedic, the Supreme Court had invited the U.S. Solicitor General to file on\ntwo questions, including whether hospital providers were entitled to bring suit\nunder {}1983 to challenge rates as inconsistent with {}(30)(A). In its brief, the\nSolicitor General supported DHHS's position that the \"efficiency, economy, and\nquality of care\" provision was too vague and amorphous for judicial\n57\n\nenforcement?-z'\nIn addition, none of the implementing regulations of § 1396a(a)(30)(A)\nestablish that DHHS was concerned with attaining a certain level of quality for\nrecipients. The regulations do not setcost-based requirements, standards, or\notherwise provide guidance as to what constitutes efficiency, economy, or quality.\nThe regulations concern upper limits on Medicaid spending and assuring against\noverutilization and fraud. See42 C.F.R. §§447.300-477.361; 456.3. As DHHS\nhas explained: \"The upper limit based on Medicare payments is limited to\nimplement'the general requirement in § [l 396a(a)(30)(A)] of the Act that\nMedicaid payment be consistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care.\"\n46 Fed. Reg. 47968 (Sept. 30, 1981.) Section 456.3 requires that states\"must\nimplement a statewide surveillance and utilization control program that - (a)\nSafeguards against unnecessary or inappropriate useof Medicaid services and\nagainst excess payments; [and] (b) Assessesthe quality of those services .... \"\nThus, the implementing regulations of § 1396a(a)(30)(A) further demonstrate that\nthe provision is too vague and amorphous tobe enforced by the courts.\nIn arguing that § (30)(A) is not vague and amorphous, the Plaintiffs here\nrely solely on this Court's holding in Orthopaedic and the district court.opinion in\n_2 The Solicitor General's brief may be found at the following web site:\nhttp://www, usd oj.gov/osg/briefs/1996/w961742w.txt.\n58\n\nClayworth. Plaintiffs read these decisions as construing § (30)(A) as meaning that\nrates for Medicaid covered services \"must bear a reasonable relationship to\nefficient and economical [providers'] costs.\" Clayworth, 295 F. Supp. 2d at 1123\n(citing Orthopaedic at 1496). Thus, plaintiffs implicitly argue that because\nOrthopaedic requires states to evaluate provider costs in order to comply with\n{}(30)(A), the provision is not so vague and amorphous as to permit recipients to\nbring a private enforcement action.\nHowex, er, Orthopaedic should not be read so broadly as to require states to\nevaluate provider costs for every service covered under Medicaid. Such a reading\nis not supported either by the terms of § (30)(A) or the legislative history of the\nMedicaid Act. In the Boren Amendment, congress had required states to conduct\nstudies of the costs incurred by hospital and nursing facilities in setting rates for\nthese services only. By contrast, § 1396a(a)(30)(A) contains no requirement for\nstates to gather cost data for each of thousands of different outpatient services and\nitems. When Congress repealed the Boren Amendment, its purpose was \"to\nprovide States with greater flexibility in setting provider reimbursement rates\nunder the Medicaid Program.\" Evergree. n Presbyterian Ministries, Ine, 235 F. 3d\nat 919. If the Orthopaedic decision is given the reading attributed to it by\nPlaintiffs, states would be required to conduct cost studies of every service\nprovided to Medicaid recipients to conduct cost findings and establish cost based\n59\n\nrates was limited to relatively few daily rates for hospital inpatient and long term\ncare facility services (e.g., there aresix daily rates for freestanding nursing facility\nservices according to Cal. Code of Regs., tit. 22, sec.51511, subd. (a)(1).) In\ncontrast, Plaintiffs would extend asimilar burden on all types of Medicaid services\nwhich incorporate thousands of separaterates._/ This result would circumvent\nCongress's intent. It would be nonsensical to infer from the language of § (30)(A)\nthat, after eliminating the requirement to all Medicaid services. For this reason,\nthe holding Orthopaedic should be limited to the unique facts of that case.\nDated: July 16, 2004 BILL LOCKYER\nAttorney General of the State of California\nDOUGLAS PRESS\nSupervising Deputy Attorney General\nELIZABETH EDWARDS\nSUSAN M.

This division shall be knc_wn and may be cited as the Lanterman\nDevelopmenud Disabilities Services Acl.\n(Added by Stats. 1977, Ch. t252.)\n4500.5. The Legislature makes the following findings regarding the State of\nCalifornia's responsibility to provide services to persons with developmental\ndisabilities, and the right of those individuals tL_receive services, pursuant tc_this\ndivision:\n(a) Since the enactment of this division in 1977, the number of consumers\nreceiving services under this division has substantially increased and the nature,\nvariety, and types of services necessary to meet the needs of the consumers and\ntheir families have also changed. Over the years the concept of service deliver?' has\nundergone mlmerous revisions. Services that were unce deemed desirable by\nconsumers and families may now no longer be appropriate, or the means ofservice\ndelivery may' be outdated.\n(b) As a result of the increased demands for services and changes in the\nmelhods inwhich those services are provided toconsumers and their families, the\nvalue statements and principles contained in this division should be updated.\n(c) Itisthe intent of the Legislature, inenacting the acl that added this section,\nto update existing law; clarify the role of consumers and their families in\ndetermining service needs; and to describe more fully service options available to\nconsumers and their families, pursuant to the individual program plan. Nothing in\nthese provisions shall be constnted to expand the existing entitlement to services\nfor persons with developmental disabilities set forth in this division.\n(d) It is the intent of the Legislature thai the department monitor regional\ncenters so that an individual consumer eligible for services and supports under this\ndivision receive the services and supports identified in his or her individual\nprogram plan.\n(Amended byStats. 1997, Ch. ,tl4, Scc. 4. Effective Scptcmbcr 22, 1997.)\n4501. The State of California accepts a responsibility for persons with\ndevelopmental disabilities and an obligation 1o them which it must discharge.\nAffecting hundreds of thousands of children and aduhs directly, and having an\nimportant impact on the lives of their families, neighbors, and whole communities,\ndevelopmental disabilities present social, medical, economic, and legal problems\nof extreme importance.\nThe complexities of providing services and supports to persons with\ndevelopmental disabilities requires the coordination of services of many state\ndepartments and commtmity agencies to ensure that no gaps occur in\ncommunication or provision ofservices and supports. A consumer of services and\nsupports, and where appropriate, his or her parents,\" legal guardian, of\nconservator, shall have a leadership role inservice design.\nF\n\n34 LANTERMANACTANDRELATEDLAWS\nAn array of '<ervices and supports shotdd he established which issufficiently\ncomplete to meet the needs and choices of each person with developmental\ndisabilities, regardless of age or degree ofdisability, and at each stage of life :-rodto\nsupport their integration into the mainstream life of th¢_community. To the\nmaxinmm extent feasible, services and supports should be available throughout\nthe state to prevent the dislocation of persons with developmental disabilities\nfrom their home communities.\nServices and supports should be available to enable persons with\ndevelopmental disabilities to approximate the pattern ofeveryday living available\nto people without disabilities of the same age. Consumers of services and\nsupports, and where appropriate, their parents, legal guardian, or conservator,\nshould be empowered to make choices in all life areas. These include promoting\nopportunities for individuals with developmeutal disabilities tobe integrated into\nthe mainstream of life in their home communities, including supported living and\nother appropriate community living arraugements. In providing these services,\nconsumers and their families, when appropriate, should participate in decisions\naffecting their own lives, including, but not limited to, where and with whom they\nlive, their relationships with people in their community, the way in which they\nspend their time, including education, employment, and leisure, the pursuit of\ntheir own personal future, and program planning and implementation. The\ncontributions made by parents and family members in support of their children\nand relatives with developmental disabilities are important and those\nrelationships should also be respected and fostered, to the m,x'cimum extent\nfeasible, so that consumers and their families can build circles of support within\nthe community.\nThe Legislature finds that the mere existence or 1he delivery of services and\nsupports is,initself, insufficient evidence of program effectiveness. It isthe intent\nof the Legislature that agencies serving persons with developmeutal disabilities\nshall produce evidence that their services have resulted in consumer or family\nempowerment and in more independent, productive, and normal lives for the\npersons served. It isfurther the intent of the Legislature that the Department of\nDevelopmental Services, through appropriate and regular monitoring activities,\nensure that regional centers meet their statutory, regulatory, and contractual\nobligations in providing services to persons with developmental disabilities. The\nLegislature declares its intent to monitor program results through continued\nlegislative oversight and review of requests for appropriations to support\ndevelopmental disabilities programs.\n(Amended byStats.1997,Ch.414.Scc.5.EffectiveSeptember22,1997.)\n4501.5.

Section 30(A) is Enforceable under §1983.\nLike the opinion below, Appellees ask this Court to ignore the controlling\nstructure of the \"entitlement\" to care and services bestowed upon eligible\nindividual recipients in Title XIX of the Social Security Act. Instead they\nmistakenly seek to transmogrify Gonzaga's example of rights creating language\n(\"No person shall be...\" used in various civil rights acts, Title VI and IX as well\nas in Section 504 and the ADA) into an exclusive, talismanic formula. But\nGonzaga University v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273,281 (2002) requires no such thing. To\nthe contrary, Gonzaga confirms the continued vitality of the Blessing, _ and\nWilder instructions on how to determine when Congress has created individual,\nenforceable federal rights. Appellees would have this Court depart from the long-\nstanding, unbroken course of decisions, from King v. Smith, 392 U.S. 309 (1968),\n(cited affirmatively as a model of enforceable statutes by Justice Rhenquist in\nPennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17-8 (1981))\nthrough Sabree v. Richmar_., 367 F.3d 180 (3raCir. 2004), holding the substantive\nrequirements of Social Security Act entitlements create federal rights. Appellees\nask this Court to become the only appellate court to refuse to enforce Title XIX's\n\nsubstantive requirements for Medicaid beneficiaries.a\nGoing well beyond the narrow issue of whether Section 30(A) creates\nindividual rights raised by the court below, the stateattempts to diminish Medicaid\nenforcement by pushing this Court into rejecting well established decisions:\n1. Although Wilder., Blessing, Arkansas Medical Society, Evergreen, Sabree.,\nand numerous other cases declared that 42 U.S.C. §1396(c) does not\npreclude a Section 1983 action to enforce a provision of the Medicaid Act,\nthat argument is repeated by Defendants in their Brief on appeal (\"DBr.\").\n2. Although every court to have considered the question has declared that the\nquality and access provisions of Section 30(A) are \"phrased in terms\nbenefitting\" Medicaid beneficiaries and that they \"are the persons Congress\nintended to benefit,\" see, e.g., Arkansas Medical SocieW, Evergreen\nPresbyterian Ministries, and Pennsylvania Pharmacists Assoc., Defendants\n1Defendants wrongfully assert that Plaintiffs have abandoned their\nargument that providers have a right to enforce Section 30(A). The lower court did\nnot rule against or address providers' standing to enforce recipients' rights, but\nmerely held providers were not intended as direct beneficiaries. The Clayworth\ncourt explicitly upheld the rights of providers to assert the rights of members and\nthird party beneficiaries. Clayworth v. Bonta, 295 F.Supp.2d 1110 (E.D.Calif.\n2003), appeal pending. See also Pennsylvania Psychiatric Soc'y v. Green Springs\nHealth Serv. Inc., 280 F.3d 278 (3rdCir.), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 841 (2002); Ohio\nAss'n of Indep. Sch. v. Goff, 92 F.3d 419, 421-2 (6thCir. 1996); Pediatric\nSpecialty Care, Inc. v. Arkansas Dept. of Human Services, 293 F.3d 472, 478 (8th\nCir. 2002).\n\nask this court to ignore Blessing's direction to consider carefully each\nprovision, arguing the quality of care andequal access provisions are so\ninextricably tied to the efficient and economical services provisions\nprotecting the interests of the state that they are not intended to be for the\nbenefit of recipients. 2\n3. In the teeth of this Court's decision in Orthopeadic Hospital v. Belshe, 103\nF.3d 1491 (9thCir. 1997), cert. denied 521 U.S. 1116 (1998), followed by\nthe court below in this case, and contrary to the unanimous holdings of\nevery other court of appeals to address the issue for determining when the\nrequirements of quality and access have been violated, Appellees ask this\nCourt to repudiate those prior decisions and declare those provisions too\nvague and amorphous to be enforceable, without even acknowledging that\nGonzaga did not raise a question about this prong of the Wilder-Blessing\ndecisions.\nThe duty created by Section 30(A) of the Medicaid Act is to provide\npayments that \"assure\" that the \"care and services\" provided eligible individuals\nare consistent with quality of care and enlist enough providers to give access to\n2For the continuing applicability of Blessing see Sabree v. Richman, su_gp__,\nRolland v. Romney, 318 F.3d 42 (1 stCir. 2003) and the Solicitor General's brief\nopposing certiorari in Haveman v. Westside Mothers., available at\nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/osg/briefs/2002/Oresponses/2002-0277.resp.pdf at 8.\n3\n\nsuch care and services equal to that available to the general public.\nThe second and third prongs of the Blessing-Wilder test are met here. The\nduties of Section 30(A) are clearly mandatory; appellees do not argue to the\ncontrary. As this Court has held, the Section 30(A) requirements of quality and\naccess are not so vague and amorphous as to be unenforceable. Finally, Congress\nhas not \"shut the door\" to private enforcement with a comprehensive alternate\nenforcement scheme, a critical factor influencing the decision that no individual\nrights existed in Gonzaga.\nLike the court below, Defendants assert, however, that the statutory duty to\nassure quality of care and equal access is merely a duty to have a policy and is\nnot owed to the recipients because of the absence of the particular rights creating\nlanguage referred to in Gonzaga. This ignores all of the other criteria Gonzaga\nconsidered in determining that Congress did not intend to create enforceable\nindividual rights, including FERPA's explicit substantive focus on a policy or\npractice, the creation of the duty in the section that says \"no funds shall be made\navailable to... an institution which has a policy or practice...\" and the presence\nof an administrative structure for individual complaints. None of those factors\nexist here.\nMore importantly, Defendants' argument ignores the entitlement \"of\n\nindividuals\" to care and services created by Sections 8 and 10 of the Medicaid\nAct, held enforceable in Sabree,su.__u_Bpr_y_so,n v. Shumway, 308 F.3d 79 (1stCir.\n2002), Westside Mothers v. Havemart., 289 F.3d 852 (6thCir.), cert. denied, 123\nS.Ct. 618 (2002), Miller by Miller v. Whitbum, 10 F.3d 1315 (7thCir. 1993),\nPediatric Specialty Care, Inc. v. Arkansas Dept. of Human Services, su_u_p__L,ewis\nv. New Mexico Dep't of Health, 261 F.3d 970 (10 tuCir. 2001), Doe v. Chiles., 136\nF.3d 709 (11 thCir. 1998), Antrican v. Buell, 158 F.Supp.2d 663 (E.D.N.C. 2001)\naffd, 290 F.3d 1178 (4tbCir. 2002), Oklahoma Chapter of American Academy of\nPediatrics v.

Substitution of the\ndefined phrase should not produce a different result.\nNeither the court below nor the Defendants acknowledge that the explicit\nrights creating language they assert is necessary here was not present in Wilder.\nGonzaga very carefully did not repudiate Wilder; this Court should not do so.\nIn order to build their argument that Section 30(A) does not create\nindividual rights, Defendants are driven to challenge Plaintiffs' statement that the\nquality of care and equal access provisions of Section 30(A) were included to\n\"protect the interest of service beneficiaries.\" (DBr.at 42-3). Courts of Appeals in\nArkansas Medical Society v. Reynolds, 6 F.3d 519 (8thCir. 1993), Evergreen\nPresbyterian Ministries, Inc. v. Hood, 235 F.3d 908, (5thCir. 2000) and\nPennsylvania Pharmacists Assoc. v. Houstoun, 283 F.3d 531,538 (3rdCir.)(en\nbanc), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 841 (2002) explicitly reached that conclusion, after\nconcluding that the efficiency and economy outcomes are for the benefit of the\nstate programs:\nThat leaves the directives to provide \"quality of care\" and adequate\naccess. These directives are \"drafted... with an unmistakable focus\n6\n\non\" Medicaid beneficiaries, not providers. Cannon., 441 U.S. at 691.\nThey are \"phrased in terms benefitting\" Medicaid recipients, Wilder,\n496 U.S. at 510, and theseare the persons that Congress intended to\nbenefit.\nIdid.\nDefendants in their brief evenrefuse to concede that the Third Circuit was\ncorrect in Sabree v. Richman, 367 F.3d 180 (3rdCir. 2004), that Title XIX\nexpresses the strong, unambiguous intention of the Congress to create individual\nentitlements to Medicaid services. The reason is obvious: the logic and structure\nof the Act ties Section 30(a)'s sufficient payment to provide quality and access as\na fundamental element of the right to receive care and assistance mandated in\nSections 8 and 10, which Sabree held enforceable. The entitlement is to a defined\nset of services which includes scope, timeliness, quality and availability. Each\nelement is part of the entitlement.\nBoth the Court below and Defendants overlook the critical importance in\nGonzaga that there was an administrative structure for individual complaints. In\nthis case, as in Wilder., see 496 U.S. at 521-28, there is no process for recipients\nwithout access to care or faced with high turnover low quality care to get\nenforcement of Section 30(A). 3As Justice Harlan wrote in connection with\n3Moreover, a GAO report, \"Long -Term Care. Federal Oversight of\nGrowing Medicaid Home and Community-Based Waivers Should be\nStrengthened,\" www.gao.gov/cgi-bin/getrept?GAO-03-576 at p 22 states \"...\n7\n\nanother part of the Social Security Act, \"We aremost reluctant to assume\nCongress has closed the avenue of effective judicial review to those individuals\nmost directly affected by the administration of its program.\" Rosario v. Wyman,\n397 U.S. 397, 421 (1970).\nThe legislative history of the Medicaid Act is not to the contrary.\nDefendants are correct, as Plaintiffs' noted in their Brief at 36 n4, that the\nlanguage in the House Report of the Committee on the Budget on the Omnibus\nReconciliation Act of 1981 which stated:\n\"The Committee wishes to emphasize that States must continue to\noperate their programs in conformity with approved State plans. Plan\nchanges that would affect the rights of Medicaid beneficiaries or\nparticipating providers would be subject to approval of the Secretary,\nwho must confirm that the State's program will continue to be\noperated in a lawful manner. Of course, in instances where the States\nor the Secretary fail to observe these statutory requirements, the\ncourts would be expected to take appropriate remedial action\"\nwas at page 301. H.R. Rept. 97-158 (97 thCong. 1StSess. 1981)(emphasis added);\nthey are wrong to suggest that the quoted language does not demonstrate\nCongress's views and intention that elements of the state plan \"that would affect\nthe rights of Medicaid beneficiaries\" are to be enforceable in court. Nothing in the\npassage suggests that it is limited to the change in payment practices for laboratory\nCMS...does not adequately monitor HCBS waiver programs or the quality of\ncare provided to waiver beneficiaries .... \"\n8\n\nservices, medical devices and drugs in the section to which it is attached. Nor do\nDefendants explain why this Court should disregard the Congress's statement in\n1992 that:\n\"Social Security beneficiaries, parents, andadvocacy groups have\nbrought hundreds of successful lawsuits alleging failure of the State\nand/or locality to comply with Stateplan requirements of the Social\nSecurity Act .... The purpose of this provision is to assure that\nindividuals who have been injured by a state's failure to comply with\nthe state plan requirements are able to seek redress in the federal\ncourts to the same extent they were able to prior to the decision in\nSuter v. Artist M.\"\nH.R. Rep. No. 102-631 at 364-6 (1992)(emphasis added). 4\nPlaintiffs are representing individuals who allege they \"have been injured by\na state's failure\" to pay rates which assure quality care for community based\nservices for persons who otherwise would be institutionalized. As detailed at\nconsiderable length in Appellants' Opening Brief and in the opinion of the District\nCourt (ER10/253/28), the record is replete with evidence, including numerous\n4Defendants misrepresent Plaintiffs' argument concerning the Suter override\nprovision. Plaintiffs' have not claimed that \"a provision is enforceable because it\nis in a state plan.\" (DBr. at 46). Plaintiffs' argument is simply that the language of\nstate plan requirements is always different than that in classic rights creating\nstatutes since it is directed at the state actor, and the Congress in the Suter\noverride directed the Court to continue to look, as it had in Wilder, at who benefits\nfrom the rights and duties, and not at whom the statutory language is directed. This\nis the holding of Rabin v. Coker-Wilson., 362 F.3d 190, 201-02 (2d Cir. 2004).\nThe court below never acknowledged this fundamental difference when it\nsought-and failed to find-- talismanic language directed at the recipient.\n9\n\nadmissions by Defendants, asto the devastating impact of the 50 percent turnover\nrates and high vacancies of direct care workers which \"puts at significant risk the\nhealth, safety, and well-being\" of persons with disabilities dependent upon such\ncare.\nIn Antrican v. Buell, 158 F.Supp.2d 663, 669 (E.D.N.C. 2001), while\nholding that \"Congress must unambiguously confer an individual entitlement to\nservices on a particular plaintiff to state a claim under §1983\"(emphasis in\noriginal), the court held that both the Quality of Care and Equal Access provisions\nof Section 30(A) provides such individual right to recipients. Upon a motion for\nreconsideration filed post-Gonzaga, the court reversed its prior decision that 42\nU.S.C. §1396a(a)(1 ) creates individual rights, McCree v.Odum, No.4:00-CV- 173\n(H)(4) (E.D.N.C., Nov. 26, 2002) at 21,5 but reaffirmed that Section 30(A) creates\nenforceable individual rights:\nOnce this section is \"broken down into manageable analytic bites,\"\nsee Blessing, 520 U.S. at 342, 117 S.Ct. at 1360, all courts which\nhave addressed this issue agree that the \"quality of care\" and\n\"adequate availability\" provisions are intended to benefit medicaid\nbeneficiaries, while the \"efficiency\" and \"economy\" provisions are\ndirected toward the state .... Therefore, this court finds that even\nunder Gonzaga's refocused inquiry, the \"quality of care\" and\n\"adequate availability\" provisions of §1396a(a)(30)(A) are directed\ntoward medicaid beneficiaries and provide them with enforceable\nrights under §1983.\n5Appellants' Reply Excerpts of Record (\"ARER\") Tab A at p.21.\n10\n\nId. at 31-32. (Internal citations omitted.)\nDefendants' raise 42 U.S.C. §1396c-the provision which allows the\nSecretary of HHS to suspend payments to a stateif it fails to \"comply\nsubstantially\" with its obligations under Title XIX-- as evidence that Section\n30(A) doesnot confer individual rights hasbeen rejected by every court to\nconsider it. No provision of Title XIX would be enforceable based on that\nargument, because §1396(c) applies acrossthe board to every stateduty under\nTitle XIX, and this argument was rejected in Wilder, su__u_Epv_e_r;green, su_gp__;\nSabree., su_gp___A;ntrican v. Odom, 290 F.3d 178, 190 (4thCir.), cert. denied, 537\nU.S. 973 (2002), Westside Mothers v. Havemart., 289 F.3d 852 (6tuCir.), cert.\ndenied, 123 S.Ct. 618 (2002). By contrast, in Blessing the \"substantial\ncompliance\" section was part of the substantive standard sought to be enforced,\nclearly demonstrating that a particular individual might not have a right to redress.\nHere it does not govern the substantive duties of the state to the recipients, but\nmerely limits one remedial measure available to the Secretary- cutting off funds.\nSimilarly, Defendants' claim that the quality of care provision 6is too vague\n6Defendants never assert the access to care provision is too amorphous to be\nenforced. The district court denied Defendants' summary judgment on that claim.\nER 10/253/52 (\"Plaintiffs have presented evidence from which a reasonable fact\nfinder could conclude that rates are not 'sufficient to enlist enough providers so\nthat care and services are available under the plan'.\")\n11\n\nand amorphous to be judicially enforced flies in the face of this Court's holding in\nOrthopaedic Hosp. v. Belshe, 103 F. 3d 1491 (1997), which is binding on\nsubsequent panels of the Court. While Orthopaedic did not consider whether the\n\"quality of care\" provision of Section 30(A) creates an enforceable right under\nBlessing, it did construe the scope of the obligation under that provision, finding\nits meaning sufficiently specific and objective for a court to enforce. And enforce\nit, it did. It is not an open question in this Circuit whether the quality of care or\naccess to care provisions are too vague and amorphous to be judicially enforced.\nDefendants' brief is completely incorrect in its assertion that the \"only two\ncourts to have considered the issue\" have found the \"efficiency, economy, and\nquality of care\" provision too vague to be judicially enforceable. (DBr. at 56)\nBesides ignoring this Court's opinion in Orthopaedic, it overlooks the fact that the\nDistrict Court in this case has twice found to the contrary. ER 1/136/1-20,\nSeptember 24, 2001; and ER 1/156/1-5 February 28, 2002. Secondly, it ignores\nthe District Court in Clayworth. Thirdly, it ignores the reported decision in\nAntrican v.Buell, su__u_p_w_,hich dealt explicitly with this issue. Fourthly, it fails to\ndisclose that not only did the court in Arkansas Medical Soc'y v. Reynolds, 6 F.3d\n519 (8thCir. 1993) explicitly hold the quality of care provision not vague and\namorphous, but the Eighth Circuit discussed and rejected the district court\n12\n\ndecision in Fulkerson v. Commissioner, 802 F.Supp.529 (D.Me. 1992) which\nAppellees press upon this Court. 6 F.3d at 527-8. As a consequence, that court\nheld the state \"must consider the relevant factors of equal access, efficiency,\neconomy and quality of care as designated in the statute when setting\nreimbursement rates.\" Id.\nWhile the Solicitor General's November 1997 brief, cited by Defendants at\nDBr. 57-8, opposing certiorari in Orthopaedic Hospital asserted, inter alia, that\nproviders should not be able to enforce Section 30(A) - - a position which it also\ntook regarding the Boren Amendment which the Supreme Court rejected in\nWilder, 496 U.S. at 513 n.11 - - and that enforcing the statutory criteria of\n\"quality of care\" would strain judicial competence, the agency with responsibility\nto administer the statute, the Health Care Financing Administration (\"HCFA\") was\narguing in a district court that instead of applying the Boren Amendment to out-of-\nstate providers, Section 30(A) should be applied. See, Children's Hospital and\nHealth Center v. Belshe., 188 F.3d 1090, 1103-4 (9t_Cir. 1999)(dissent), \"In short,\nin the view of HCFA, this provision [Section 30(A)] requires a state to ensure that\nits payments to out-of-state providers are reasonable .... \" (Emphasis in original).\nThis is an enforceable standard. 7 In this case, where payments yielded turnover\n7The Solicitor General's principal opposition to the Orthopaedic decision\nwas its requirement that the provider hospitals' costs be covered, even in the\n13\n\nrates of 50% and the Defendants admitted they put in jeopardy the safety and well-\nbeing of program recipients aswell ascompliance with the statutory mandate to\n\"help... individuals attain or retain capabilities for independence or self care\" 42\nU.S.C. §1396, the central importance of the quality of care provision to the\nentitlement to services cannot be doubted.8 The lower court had no hesitancy in\nbelieving that it could ascertain whether services were \"consistent with quality of\ncare.\" ER 10/253/51. The basis for such determinations would be statutory and\nregulatory indicia of care such asadherence to safety codes and staffing levels,\nmeeting recognized professional standards of care, appropriate programing, and\ncompliance with regulatory requirements such asthose set forth at 42 CFR\n§483.400 et seq. for ICFRs.\nThe Fourth Circuit summarized the reason for enforcing Section 30(A)\nwhen it stated \"[T]he Medicaid Act clearly mandates that a stateprovide a certain\nabsenceof any evidence of lack of accessor lack of quality. By contrast, the courts\nin Evergreen, su_u_p__a,nd Methodist Hospitals v. Sullivan, 91 F.3d 1026 (7tuCir.\n1996), did focus on the result, not on the cost methodology, of the payment. In\nOrthopaedic the particular facts of the case, that the result of sufficient out-patient\naccess (the service for which the payments were at issue) arose not from the\npayment rates but because hospitals were otherwise required to provide the\nservices, may have been critical to the cost methodology standard.\n8Staff stability (turnover and vacancies) is one of the core indicators of\nquality chosen by the National Association of State Directors of Developmental\nDisabilities Services National Core Indicators Project. See Declaration of William\nJ. Bowman, ARER 391/2-3.\n14\n\nlevel and quality of... care. In light of this duty, a federal court can direct the\naffirmative action of complying with this duty.\" Antrican v. Odom, 290 F.3d at\n191 (internal quotes omitted). A Medicaid recipient's entitlement to receive that\nlevel and quality of care does not exist without a private right to enforce the\nQuality of Care and Equal Access provisions of Section 30(A).\nII. No Finding of the District Court with Respect to the Named Plaintiffs\nAffects the Maintainability of the Class.\nContrary to the arguments made at pages 16-18 of Appellees' Brief, no\nfinding by the District Court in its August 6, 2002 opinion ruling on the Motion\nfor Summary Judgment with respect to the named plaintiffs affects the\nmaintainability of this class action. The fact that at least three of the seven named\nplaintiffs were deinstitutionalized, between the May, 2000 filing of the complaint\nand the August, 2002 District Court's decision on the Motion for Summary\nJudgment does not affect the maintainability of the class, nor does the prospect\nthat two more named plaintiffs might be deinstitutionalized shortly after the\nDistrict Court's decision.\nThe court certified the class by an order dated August 2, 2001, ER 1/108/1-\n11, and confirmed all seven of the named plaintiffs individuals as class\nrepresentatives.\nThe District Court's August 6, 2002 opinion granting Defendants' Motion\n15\n\nfor Summary Judgment discusses the sevennamed plaintiffs at pages 29-33, ER\n10/253/29-33. The District Court's findings with respect to named plaintiffs\nTobiason, De Santo and Compton is that they have, since the filing of the\ncomplaint, been moved from an institution to the community. ER 10/253/30-33.\nNamed plaintiff Sanchez (who has been institutionalized for 33 years)\nremained institutionalized at the time of the summary judgment motions despite\nthe recommendation for community placement in his IPPs. ER 10/253/29. The\nDistrict Court noted that he had been put on the Lanterman DC's CPP list for\ncommunity placement for a projected move date of July, 2002. Similarly, named\nplaintiff Nigian has been institutionalized since 1991, has been recommended for\nplacement since 1992, and remained institutionalized as of the time of decision of\nthe District Court. ER 10/253/30. The District Court noted that Nigian's CPP\nanticipated a placement in January, 2003. Whether Sanchez or Nigian has been\nplaced in the community since the District Court's decision does not appear of\nrecord, but even if one or both were this does not affect the maintainability of the\nclass of unjustifiably institutionalized persons.\nAt least since Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393 (1975), federal law has been\nclear that once a class has been certified, \"the class of unnamed persons described\nin the certification acquired a legal status separate from the interest asserted by\n16\n\n[the named plaintiff],\" 419 U.S. at 399 andthe fact that later the plaintiff no longer\nsuffers the injury of which he originally complains doesnot affect the\nmaintainability of the class action aslong asthere areunnamed class members\nwho continue to have that injury. United States Parole Commission v. Geraghty,\n445 U.S. 388, 398-99 (1980):\n'Given a properly certified class', the live interests of unnamed but\nidentifiable class members may supply the personal stake required by\nArt III when the named plaintiff's individual claim becomes moot.\n[citations omitted] 445 U.S. at 413. Gerstein v Pugh, 420 U.S. 103 - 111 at n. 11\n(1975); See Deposit Guaranty Nat'l Bank v. Roper, 445 U.S. 326, 342 at n. 1\n(1980) (Stevens, J. concurring):\n\"There is general agreement that, if a class has been properly\ncertified, the case does not become moot simply because the class\nrepresentative's individual interest in the merits of the litigation has\nexpired.\"\nAt no time after certification of the class, have Defendants moved to\ndecertify the class, nor could they.\nIII. Plaintiffs Did Raise a Material Issue of Fact in the District Court That\nCalifornia's Conduct Resulted in Widespread Unjustified\nInstitutionalization\nIn the August 6, 2002 opinion of the District Court, it concluded that\nDefendants' motions for summary judgment must be granted because the evidence\nof instances of unjustifiable institutionalization of class members were only\n17\n\n\"sporadic\" and \"isolated\", and there was no evidentiary basis for concluding the\nexistence of\"systematic\" discrimination. ER 10/253/46. Plaintiffs, in their brief\non appeal at pp.48-50, demonstrated that the conclusion was based on an\nerroneous failure to take into account the inferences which may be drawn from the\n1125 individuals referred to in the document entitled \"Developmental Center\nResidents That Have Been Recommended for Placement as of May, 2001\"\nproduced by Defendants in discovery. Instead, the Court wrongfully resolved the\ndisputed issue of fact by accepting the vague and imprecise Declaration of a\nCalifornia official attempting to explain away that document. ER 6/183/7-8. The\nCourt erred, therefore, by concluding there were no material issues of disputed fact\nas to whether there is a widespread and systematic unjustified institutionalization\nthat warrants class-wide relief.\nAt pp. 18-19 of Defendants' brief on appeal they seek to avoid this\nconclusion by contending that it was \"plaintiffs' burden\" to demonstrate that in\ngranting Defendants' motions for summary judgment, the trial court \"abused its\ndiscretion\" by basing \"its decision on an erroneous legal standard or on clearly\nerroneous findings of fact.\" Defendants' then further define a \"clearly erroneous\"\nfinding as: \"although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the\nentire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been\n18\n\ncommitted\" citing U.S.v. Alisal Water Corp., 370 F.3d 915,921 (9thCir. 2004)\nand Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 573 (1985).\nDefendants' articulation of the standard for reviewing the correctness of the\nDistrict Court's granting of defendants' own motions for summary judgment is\nprofoundly mistaken, and indeed almost the opposite of the correct standard.\nNeither case directly involved the grant of summary judgment denying or granting\nan injunction. Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, involved an appeal from the\nfindings of fact of a district court after a non-jury trial in a gender discrimination\ncase. United States v. Alisal Water Corp., involved a decision on a petition to\nintervene. The \"abuse of discretion\" standard of review to which the court refers\nin Midgett v. Tri-countv Metropolitan Transportation District, 254 F.3d 546 (9th\nCir. 2001)(cited by Defendants) concerns the appropriateness of the scope of the\ninjunctive relief, not the establishment of the facts upon which liability and the\ngrant of the injunction depend. This difference is also illustrated in Dare v.\nCalifornia, 191 F.3d 1167, 1170 (9tuCir. 1999).\nIn reaching the factual determination that there are or are not 1125\nindividuals in California's developmental centers who do not need institutional\nplacements, the Court of Appeals must determine whether Plaintiffs submitted\nevidence which raised a material issue of disputed fact; not, as Defendants' brief\n19\n\nmistakenly suggests, the contrary_test asto whether \"although there is evidence to\nsupport it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and\nconfirm conviction that amistake hasbeen committed\".\nSummary judgment is properly granted only when no genuine and disputed\nissuesof material fact remain after viewing the evidence most favorably to the\nnon-moving party. Fed. R. Cir. P. 56; Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317,\n322-23 (1996); Eisenberg v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., 815 F.2d 1285, 1288-89 (9thCir.\n1987). (Emphasis supplied.)\nHere, therefore, Defendants bear the burden of showing that there is no\nmaterial factual dispute and the court must draw all reasonable inferences from the\nevidence in favor of the Plaintiffs, Intel Corp. v. Hartford Accident & Indem. Co.,\n952 F.2d 1551, 1558 (9thCir. 1991).\nFor purposes of the District Court's deciding Defendants' motions for\nsummary judgement, therefore, Plaintiffs' evidence at least has raised a material\nissue of disputed fact that there are 1125 Developmental Center residents who\ncould be placed in the community. If, because of Defendants' general policies,\nthese individuals are not being placed in the community at a reasonable pace,\nPlaintiffs clearly show that unjustified institutionalization is \"systematic\" and not\nmerely \"isolated\" or \"sporadic\".\n2o\n\nFinally, Plaintiffs' undisputed evidence of Defendants' policy of low rates\nleading to low wages and benefits of workers providing direct care in the\ncommunity clearly qualifies asa \"systematic\" policy of Defendants. Accordingly,\nthe evidence submitted to the District Court in connection with the summary\njudgment motions raises amaterial issue of disputed fact that Plaintiffs seekto\nremedy widespread harm which flows from asystemic policy.\nIV. There is Substantial Evidence in the Record Creating a Material Issue\nof Disputed Fact Concerning the Causal Relationship Between Low\nWages and Benefits of Community Direct Care Workers and\nUnjustified Institutionalization of Developmental Center Residents.\nThe District Court's opinion granting Defendants' Motion for Smmrmry\nJudgment, is based in part on its conclusion, ER 10/253/40-41, that Plaintiffs\nfailed to support by evidence a causal link between increasing the wages and\nbenefits of direct care community workers and reducing or eliminating unjustified\ninstitutionalization. At pp. 50-55 of Appellants Brief, Plaintiffs demonstrated the\nerroneousness of that conclusion. Defendants' attempt to respond to this evidence\nDBr. 24-27 is flawed.\nIn evaluating the causal relationship between increasing wages and benefits,\nit must be recalled that 70% or more of the costs of maintaining a developmentally\ndisabled person in the community are accounted for by the wages and benefits\n21\n\npaid to direct care workers. ER 8/217/130; ER 8/217/176-180. 9 Thus the rates\nCalifornia's DDS pays through the Regional Centers for maintenance in the\ncommunity are spent 70% for this component. In the year before the summary\njudgment motions were filed, California established a new CPP plan for moving\ndevelopmental center residents into the community which permitted the Regional\nCenters to raise rates paid for community care to a level which would produce the\nservices needed to move some of the individuals still in the developmental centers.\nER 6/183/2 et seq. In their declarations filed in this case, directors of two different\nRegional Centers, Michael Clark and James Shorter, 1°both averred that\nexperience to date demonstrates that it requires a doubling of rates to secure the\nservices needed. In Mr. Shorter's case he based his conclusions on his knowledge\nof the placements in his region and the data available in the spring of 2002, that\nthe doubling of rates means that the direct care and wages have doubled. Shorter\n9See Appellants' Response to Appellees' Motion to Strike filed June 29,\n2004 and (assigned to this panel) at page 5 correcting the location in the District\nCourt docket where certain testimony included in the Excerpts of Record is found.\n1°The regional centers and their directors are not parties to this action. The\nregional centers are independent non-profit organizations through which\nCalifornia operates programs under the Lanterman Act. Mr. Clark has been a\nregional center director for 15 years with responsibility for about 4600 consumers,\nER 7/213/2. Mr. Shorter has been a regional center director for 10 years and\ninvolved in California's developmental disabilities service system for more than\nthirty years. ER 8/238/3.\n22\n\ngoes on to say:\n\"For all the reasons and considerations discussed above, I conclude\nthat the state's new Community Placement Program demonstrates\nthat, in order to obtain quality programs for consumers, it is necessary\nfor service providers to double the wages and benefits paid to direct\ncare workers.\"\nER 8/238/6. Appellees' Brief at pp. 24-27 attacks this conclusion because it is not\nbased on actual data of what wages and benefits have actually been paid, but\nrather on these deductions by officials from their knowledge of the field. But, the\nevidence is sufficient under all the circumstances to raise a material issue of\ndisputed fact.\nMoreover, Diane Anand, a third Regional Center director, in March of 2002\ngave a declaration which confirms the causal link between the continued\nunjustifiable institutionalization and the level of wages and benefits of direct care\nworkers in the community with respect to a list of Developmental Center residents\nwho are recommended for placement in the community as follows:\n\"Each of the people with developmental disabilities referred to in the\nrecords as capable of handling and benefitting from community\nliving, needing or wanting community services but admitted or\ncommitted or recommitted to a state institution were placed or\nretained there because the community services required for the person\nare not available in the community. They are not available because\nthe payments for community services, including particularly the\ncomponent to pay for wages and benefits for direct services\nprofessionals are insufficient to secure stable services of quality.\"\n23\n\nER 5/176/5. Attached to Ms. Anand's declaration are the records of five\nindividuals in the Lanterman Developmental Center as to whom this statement is\ntrue. ER 5/176/7-47. Defendants attempt to dismiss Ms. Anand's sworn statement\nas \"conclusory\", but as head of one of the organizations responsible to develop\ncommunity placements, her statements cannot be so easily ignored. Ms. Anand's\ntestimony also refutes the Defendants' contention at DBr. 25 that \"Plaintiffs have\nnot identified.., a single person who is improperly institutionalized because of\ninadequate wages.\"\nV. Both the District Court and Defendants Substantially Overestimate the\nCost of Relief Requested by Plaintiffs.\nDefendants asserted a fimdamental alteration defense to Plaintiffs\nunjustifiable institutionalization claim. Defendants acknowledge, DBr. 27, they\nbear the burden of proving fundamental alteration. Defendants assert that the cost\nof raising wages and benefits of community direct care workers is so great that it\nmeets their burden and continue by asserting the outlandish claim that in\nmeasuring the cost of the increase to the State's budget, \"the possibility of\nincreased federal reimbursement is irrelevant to the analysis.\" DBr. 35.\nThe District Court in its opinion, ER 10/253/44, concluded that the cost of\nproviding the relief doubling of direct care wages and benefits would be $1.4\nBillion per year and credited the April 18, 2003 Declaration of Defendants'\n24\n\nwitness Phyllis Marquez, ER6/184/1-13, that California's opportunity for\nobtaining additional Federal Financial Participation (FFP) to pay for part of the\nwages would be about $115 million. A careful reading of Marquez's April 18,\n2003 Declaration, discloses that there is as much as $790 million total of\nunmatched DDS' spending for developmental disabilities that is available for\nfederal matching and that there is an additional $247.8 million available from\nother state agencies. ER 6/184/12.\nThe error of the District Court's adoption of Marquez's $115,000,000 in the\nface of Plaintiffs' evidence giving rise to contrary inferences is further\ndemonstrated by subsequent developments based on documents of which the\nCourt may take judicial notice.\nIn her declaration of April 18, 2002, Marquez stated she estimated that FFP\nin the Home and Community Based Services (\"HCBS\") waiver would increase\nover the seven years from 2000-01 to 2007-08 only by $115 million assuming \"all\npersons who are currently eligible under the waiver are enrolled.\"\nNot only, as noted in Plaintiffs' brief, did Ms. Marquez's later deposition\nrefute her, but documents submitted by DDS to the legislature which are judicially\nnoticeable under Federal Rule of Evidence 201 (b) show that in only three years,\n2000-01 to 2003-04 the DDS FFP in the Medicaid Waiver increased $264 million.\n25\n\nThe Department of Developmental Services \"2001-02 May Revision Regional\nCenters\" to the Governor's Budget, submitted May 14, 2001 atpage F-1 shows the\ntotal Medicaid Waiver for the Regional Centers as $548,227,000, including both\nthe General Fund share andthe FFP. Based on the FFP shareshown on page F-2\nof 51.36%, the FFP for 2000-01 was $281,569,000.11 The most recent budget\ndocuments submitted to the legislature by the Department of Developmental\nServices, \"Regional Centers Local Assistance Estimate, May 2004 Revision of the\n2004-05 Budget\" submitted May 13, 2004, shows at page E-19.5, the FFP for the\nDDS Medicaid Waiver to be $546,490,000 for CY 2003-04.1l The increase from\n$282 million to $546 million is $264 million.\nThe above exercise demonstrating the unreliability of Marquez's prediction\nmerely shows what DDS has actually done in the last 3 years, with respect to the\nHCBS waiver. It does not begin to address the additional FFP DDS and other\ndepartments might have obtained by reconfiguring the Medicaid Program as\nsuggested in the Lakin andBraddock declaration which the District Court\nwrongfully disregarded. ER 2/166/18-29.\nThe District Court's opinion also erred in considering the entire cost of the\nllARER, JN1 at pages 2 - 3.\nI_ARER, JN2, at page 6.\n26\n\nincrease in direct care wages andbenefits in evaluating whether Defendants had\ndischarged their burden of proving the fundamental alteration defense under\nOlmstead. Plaintiffs' requested relief is designed to remedy not only the\nunjustifiable institutionalization of about a couple of thousand consumers under\nthe ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (as to which the fundamental\nalteration test might apply), it is also designed to remedy the Defendants' violation\nof the requirement of the Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A), to provide\naccess to quality care for the multiple tens of thousands of consumers served in the\ncommunity (as to which violation there is no fundamental alteration defense\nwhatsoever). At the very least, this case should be remanded to develop a record\nwhich shows whether the cost to California of raising wages and benefits of those\ndirect care workers needed to serve in the community just those consumers who\nare unjustifiably institutionalized is large enough to constitute a fundamental\nalteration.\nFinally, while Plaintiffs have described the requested relief in general terms,\nas \"doubling rates,\" whether that is the exact measure of the relief which should be\nordered by the Court or whether the number is more or less is an exercise which\nshould be dealt with at a later stage of litigation concerning the fine tuning of\n27\n\nrelief. 13In ruling on Defendants' motions for summary judgment, the District\nCourt should have focused on whether Plaintiffs created amaterial issue of fact\nthat Defendants are violating the deinstitutionalization mandates of the ADA and\nRehabilitation Act, not on whether the particular relief demanded is appropriate.\nIf liability is established, it will be time enough for the District Court to fine tune\nthe relief.\nVI. California Had No Olmstead Plan When the Court Granted\nDefendants' Summary Judgment Motions\nThe District Court's finding that Defendants' new CPP program constitutes\na deinstitutionalization plan does not meet the legal requirements established by\nOlmstead v. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581 (1999) and Frederick L. v. Department of\nPublic Welfare, 364 F.3d 487 (3d Cir. 2004) for the following reasons.\nTo begin with, Defendants at no time prior to the granting of their motion\nfor summary judgment actually claimed to have an Olmstead Plan and, as\nPlaintiffs' Opening Brief on Appeal indicated, Defendants were just beginning in\nthe Spring of 2002 to have community meetings to formulate one.\nSecondly, there currently is no \"assurance\" by California that there \"will be\non going progress toward community placement\" Frederick L, su__, 364 F.3d at\n13AsPlaintiffs' counsel argued to the District Court in June, 2002. See\nAppellees' Supplemental Excerpts of Record Volume III/Tab 27/0749, 0795.\n28\n\n500 (emphasis supplied). The statutory sections (Welfare and Institutions Code §§\n4418.2, 4418.25) cited atDBr. 31 direct the stateto prepare acomprehensive plan,\nand describe the nature of the plan to beprepared, but provide no commitment as\nto contents, no specific numbers andno aggregate standards.14 It is not aplan.\nThe fact that, after the instant action was filed and in the year or sojust before the\nDefendants' motion for summary judgment was filed, DDS sought and obtained\nsubstantial increased appropriations to fund community placements over atwo\nyear period of 183 consumers, seeJackson Declaration ¶ 24, ER 6/183/10 (out of a\npool arguably atleast as large as 1125)15can not reasonably be interpreted asa\nfuture commitment to the remaining hundreds of institutionalized consumers.\nIndeed, asthe United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit said:\n\"There is no reference in Olmstead to a state's past progress in\ndeinstitutionalization asrelevant to analyzing a fundamental\nalteration defense ....\nAlthough the District Court did not err in taking into account the\nCommonwealth's [of Pennsylvania] past progress in evaluating its\nfundamental alteration defense, it was unrealistic (or unduly\noptimistic) in assuming past progress is areliable prediction of future\n14Inany event these statutory sections were not in effect when the District\nCourt granted Defendants' motion for summary judgment.\n15Nowherein the record is it indicated how the 183 individuals upon whom\nDDS' current \"CPP Plan\" focuses were chosen. How can Defendants have a\n\"comprehensive\" plan without articulating systematic, rational and fair criteria for\nselecting which eligible consumers limited resources will be spent on?\n29\n\nprograms.\"\n364 F.3d at 499-500.\nThirdly, there is no \"waiting list that moved at a reasonable pace,\"\nOlmstead, 527 U.S. at 605 that a court may review. Neither the District Court's\nopinion of August 6, 2002, nor Defendants' Brief on Appeal points to one.\nThe 1125 individuals on Defendants' list of \"Developmental Center\nResidents That Have Been Recommended for Placement as of May of 2001,\" ER\n7/215/1-56, must be compared with the facts that: (1) for the three year period\npreceding summary judgment admissions to Developmental Centers have\nexceeded discharges and (2) at the rate of less than 183 expected discharges every\ntwo years contemplated under the current CPP plan, it will take more than 12 years\nto deinstitutionalize them all. The comparison shows there is no \"reasonable\npace.\" Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 605-06.\nVII. Conclusion\nDefendants admit and the District Court found that at the time of the\nmotions for summary judgment:\n(1) for about a decade Califomia had failed to raise rates for community\ncare providers sufficiently to keep up with inflation which has caused substantial\nerosion of the wages and benefits paid to direct care workers, ER 10/253/11-12;\n30\n\nER 9/245/60,81,160;\n(2) that erosion hasresulted in aninability to hire skilled workers and very\nhigh turnover, ER 10/253/26; ER 9/245/60, 81,160;\n(3) very high turnover and the absenceof skilled workers has significantly\ndamagedthe quality of community services to apoint that Defendants have called\na \"crisis,\" ER 10/253/26-28; ER 9/245/60, 81,160;\n(4) very high turnover of direct care workers in community service results in\nthe waste of substantial dollars to recruit and train replacements, ER 10/253/27;\nER 9/245/80-81;\n(5) the pace of discharges from the Developmental Centers has slowed to\nthe point that, in the three years preceding the motion for summary judgment,\nwhen deaths in the Developmental Centers are excluded, there were more\nadmissions to Developmental Centers than discharges, ER 10/253/18;\n(6) The consumers remaining in the Developmental Centers are among the\nmore seriously challenged, ER 10/253/24;\nIn the new CPP program adopted by California in the year prior to the\nmotions for summary judgment, authorization to exceed the current rate structure\nfor community services has been given and is being used to move out or deflect\nfrom the Developmental Centers 183 more seriously challenged consumers over a\n31\n\ntwo year period. ER 6/183/10. The testimony of Stephen Miller and Charlene\nHolden, headsof two of the organizational plaintiffs, clearly supports the\ninference that maintaining in the community consumers with serious challenges\nrequires the employment of a qualified and skilled workforce which demands\nhigher wages and benefits. ER 8/217/16-21, 25; ER 8/217/130-138. The\ndeclarations of three regional center directors, Michael Clark, James Shorter and\nDiane Anand ER 7/213/1-6; ER 8/238/1-6; ER 5/176/4-5 support the conclusion\nthat it requires a substantial increase of rates and in turn of wages and benefits of\ndirect careworkers properly to maintain in the community the seriously\nchallenged consumers now in the Developmental Centers who are recommended\nfor placement in the community. Even the Declaration of Julie Jackson, a senior\nDDS official, in discussing the substantial amounts that under DDS's new CPP\nplan have been budgeted to discharge and maintain in the community over the\nnext two years 183 of the more seriously challenged consumers remaining in the\nDevelopmental Centers doesn't exclude the fact that this is being done by paying\nhigher wages. ER 6/183/10.\nIn light of all of this evidence, and bearing in mind that it is Plaintiffs'\nburden only to raise amaterial issue of disputed fact, it must be concluded that the\nDistrict Court erred in deciding that Plaintiffs failed to establish acausal link\n32\n\nbetween insufficient wages and California's lack of compliance with the\ndeinsfitutionalization mandates of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation\nAct.\nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED,\nPUBLIC INTEREST LAW CENTER\nOF PHILADELPHIA\nZaA-z \nBy:\nMichael Churchill\nThomas K.

Plaintiffs oppose this motion. The matter was submitted on the \npapers. Having considered all of the papers filed by the parties, the Court GRANTS \nDefendants' motion. (Docket no. 497.) \nBACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs, consisting of a class of individuals with developmental disabilities and several \norganizations, have sued State officials responsible for the administration of programs for \nindividuals with developmental disabilities. The only remaining claim of Plaintiffs' complaint \nalleges that Defendants violated Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § \n1396a(a)(30)(A), (§ 30(A)) by failing to fund adequately community care facilities for \ndevelopmentally disabled individuals. On August 10, 2001, Defendants moved for partial \njudgment on the pleadings on Plaintiffs' § 30(A) claim. (Docket no. 116.) The issue was \nwhether Plaintiffs could bring suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to challenge the State's \nimplementation of the \"efficiency, economy, and quality of care\" provision of § 30(A). The \nCourt found that Plaintiffs could do so. Accordingly, on September 24, 2001, this Court \nissued an order denying Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings (JOP Order). \n(Docket no. 136.) \nAfter the Court's JOP Order, the Supreme Court decided Gonzaga University v. Doe, 536 \nU.S. 273, 122 S.Ct. 2268, 153 L.Ed.2d 309 (2002), which Defendants contend undermines \nthe authorities relied on by this Court in its JOP Order. Defendants now move for \nreconsideration of the JOP Order in light of Gonzaga. \nLEGAL STANDARD \nUnder Rule 59(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Civil Local Rule 7-9, the \ngranting of a motion for reconsideration is a matter of discretion for a district court and is \nappropriate if the district court: \n1062*1062 (1) is presented with newly discovered evidence, (2) committed clear error or the \ninitial decision was manifestly unjust, or (3) if there is an intervening change in controlling \nlaw. \nSchool District No. 1J, Multnomah County v. ACandS, Inc., 5 F.3d 1255, 1263 (9th \nCir.1993). \n\nDISCUSSION \nThe statute at issue, Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A), \nprovides: \n[A] State plan for medical assistance must ... provide such methods and procedures relating \nto the ... payment for care and services under the plan ... as may be necessary ... to assure \nthat payments are consistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care and are sufficient \nto enlist enough providers so that care and services are available under the plan at least to \nthe extent that such care and services are available to the general population in the \ngeographic area. \n42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A). \nThe question at hand is whether § 30(A) confers a private right enforceable pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983. \"Section 1983 imposes liability on anyone who, under color of state law, \ndeprives a person `of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and \nlaws.'\" Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329, 340, 117 S.Ct. 1353, 137 L.Ed.2d 569 \n(1997) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 1983). \nBefore Gonzaga, the Supreme Court had established a three-part test for determining \nwhether a statute creates an enforceable right for purposes of allowing a suit under § \n1983:(1) whether the plaintiff is one of the intended beneficiaries of the statute; (2) whether \nthe plaintiff's asserted interests are not so \"vague and amorphous\" as to be \"beyond the \ncompetence of the judiciary to enforce\"; and (3) whether the statute imposes a \"binding \nobligation\" on the State rather than merely expressing a \"congressional preference\" for a \ncertain kind of conduct. See, e.g.,Blessing, 520 U.S. at 340-41, 117 S.Ct. 1353; Wilder v. \nVirginia Hosp. Ass'n, 496 U.S. 498, 509, 110 S.Ct. 2510, 110 L.Ed.2d 455 (1990). The JOP \nOrder analyzed each of these elements, and concluded that § 30(A) does confer rights that \nPlaintiffs may enforce using § 1983. \nSubsequent to the JOP Order, the Supreme Court decided Gonzaga. AlthoughGonzaga did \nnot involve Title XIX, it clarified how to determine whether a statute confers an individual \nright enforceable under § 1983.[1] Defendants posit thatGonzaga overruled Wilder. This is \nnot entirely accurate. Gonzaga does not change the overall framework for discerning rights \nenforceable under § 1983 that was articulated in Blessing and Wilder. Gonzaga merely \nrefined the first part of the three-part test, providing guidance to courts in determining \nwhether a plaintiff is an intended beneficiary of a statute. \n\nUnder Gonzaga, a plaintiff may bring suit under § 1983 as an intended beneficiary of a \nstatute only if the statute unambiguously demonstrates congressional intent to confer an \nindividual or personal right on that plaintiff. Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283, 122 S.Ct. 2268. The \ndispute in Gonzaga arose when a student sued his university, alleging that unauthorized \ndisclosure of private information violated the Family 1063*1063Educational Rights and \nPrivacy Act (FERPA).[2] FERPA prevents institutions that disclose educational records \nwithout consent from receiving federal funding. The plaintiff asserted that he had a right \nenforceable by § 1983 because Congress intended FERPA to benefit the class he belonged \nto, students of federally funded institutions. Id. at 282, 122 S.Ct. 2268. However, the Court \nconcluded that FERPA did not create an enforceable right. Id. at 290, 122 S.Ct. 2268. \nThe Gonzaga Court rejected the framework in which rights enforceable by § 1983 were \ndetermined by a \"relatively loose standard.\" Id. at 282, 122 S.Ct. 2268. Gonzagaclarified \nthat the intended beneficiary inquiry required \"an unambiguously conferred right to support \na cause of action brought under § 1983.\" Id. at 283, 122 S.Ct. 2268. In so \ndoing, Gonzaga identified additional considerations in determining whether a potential \nplaintiff is an intended beneficiary. These new considerations change the Court's \ndetermination in the JOP Order. \nI. Rights-Creating Language \nThe first consideration in the intended beneficiary analysis looks for \"rights-creating\" \nlanguage in the statute. Id. at 287, 122 S.Ct. 2268. This inquiry examines whether the \"text \nand structure\" of the statute indicates congressional intent to confer an individual right. Id. \nGonzaga directs the Court to look for \"individually focused terminology,\" that is, a focus on \nthe individual protected rather than the person or entity regulated. Id. \nThere can be little doubt that § 30(A) fails to employ the \"no person shall\" language cited by \nthe Gonzaga Court as the epitome of rights-creating language. Id. at 287, 122 S.Ct. 2268. \nTextually, § 30(A) is phrased in terms of what a State plan for medical assistance must \nprovide to administrators and recipients of Title XIX services. While § 30(A) benefits both \nrecipients and providers of Title XIX services, the language of the statute does not clearly \nconfer an enforceable right on either.Gonzaga has made clear that the effect of conferring a \nbenefit is not enough to warrant a private right enforceable by § 1983. \"For a statute to \ncreate such private rights, its text must be `phrased in terms of the persons \nbenefitted.'\" Id. at 284, 122 S.Ct. 2268, citing Cannon v. Univ. of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, \n692, n. 13, 99 S.Ct. 1946, 60 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). \n\nThe language of FERPA focused on how the Director of Education should make funding \ndecisions. The Gonzaga Court found this \"two steps removed from the interest of individual \nstudents and parents.\" Id. at 287, 122 S.Ct. 2268. Like FERPA, § 30(A) does not speak \ndirectly to the persons benefitted. Section 30(A) addresses the quality of services available \nto \"the general population in the geographic area,\" but does so in indirect terms, too vague \nto confer an enforceable right upon those providing or receiving services. 42 U.S.C. § \n1396a(a)(30)(A). \nPlaintiffs rely upon the fact that Medicaid recipients are mentioned in the opening language \nof Title XIX to assert that individual recipients of Medicaid are intended beneficiaries. 42 \nU.S.C. § 1396. However, the language used by Congress does not pass Gonzaga muster. \nIn light of Gonzaga, conferring a benefit is not the 1064*1064 same as conferring a right \nenforceable under § 1983. For example, Gonzaga recognized that plaintiffs would have an \nenforceable private right pursuant to a statute which \"explicitly conferred specific monetary \nentitlements upon the plaintiffs.\" Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 280, 122 S.Ct. 2268. However, there \nis no such specific monetary entitlement conferred upon Medicaid recipients in § 30(A). \nThus, there is no rights-creating language in § 30(A) bestowing an enforceable right upon \nPlaintiffs. \nII. Aggregate Focus \nThe second indicator of congressional intent to confer an individual right is whether a \nstatute has a focus on individual rights rather than an \"aggregate focus.\" Gonzaga,536 U.S. \nat 288, 122 S.Ct. 2268. Gonzaga directs the Court to examine whether the statute speaks in \nterms of \"institutional policy and practice\" rather than individual entitlement. Id. Section \n30(A) has an aggregate focus. The statute speaks, not of any individual's right, but of the \nState's obligation to develop \"methods and procedures\" of providing medical services. \nIndeed, the only mention of recipients of Title XIX services is in the aggregate, as \"the \ngeneral population in the geographic area.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A). A statutory \nprovision that refers to the individual only in the context of describing a State policy or \npractice does not reflect a congressional intent to create a private right of \naction. Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 287, 122 S.Ct. 2268. \nIII. Other Post-Gonzaga Decisions \nBoth parties draw attention to cases decided post-Gonzaga. In considering the private right \nto enforce various provisions of Title XIX, these cases present conflicting results. While \nother district and circuit courts have addressed issues similar to the issue at hand, none of \n\nthe cases cited by either party is binding on this Court. However, these cases support the \nCourt's decision to grant Defendants' motion for reconsideration. \nThere is no post-Gonzaga case in which a court, considering the guidelines articulated \nin Gonzaga, has found that § 30(A) gives Medicaid recipients a private right enforceable \nunder § 1983. Plaintiffs' reliance on Ass'n of Residential Res. in Minn. v. Minn. Comm'r of \nHuman Servs., 2003 WL 22037719 (D.Minn.2003), (ARRM ) is unpersuasive. ARRM holds \nthat § 30(A) \"continues to provide a private right of action for plaintiffs, at least in the typical \nMedicaid context.\" ARRM, 2003 WL 22037719 at 7. First, however, the issue in ARRM was \nwhether § 30(A) applied to waiver plans. Id. at 8. Here, there is no waiver plan at issue. \nSecond, the ARRMcourt arrived at its holding without discussing the factors articulated by \nthe Supreme Court in Gonzaga. \nMost of the cases to consider § 30(A) according to the Gonzaga guidelines have denied a \nprivate right of action to both Medicaid recipients and providers. See Sabree v. \nHouston, 245 F.Supp.2d 653, 660 (E.D.Pa.2003), (holding that recipients had no private \nright to enforce § 1396a, of which § 30(A) is a subsection); Burlington United Methodist \nFamily Servs., Inc. v. Atkins, 227 F.Supp.2d 593, 597 (W.Va.2002),(holding that health care \nproviders had no private right under § 30(A) enforceable under § 1983); Cal. Ass'n of Health \nFacilities v. State Dep't of Health Servs., C 03-736 VRW (N.D.Cal. July 15, 2003), (holding \nthat a non-profit association representing Medicaid providers could not bring a § 1983 \nchallenge under § 30(A)). \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Defendants' motion for reconsideration (Docket no. 497) is \nGRANTED. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS judgment on the pleadings 1065*1065 for \nDefendants. Because Plaintiffs' claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A) were the \nonly claims remaining after summary judgment motions, this order terminates the case in its \nentirety. Thus, Plaintiffs' motion for leave to file supplemental findings of fact and \nconclusions of law (Docket no. 495) and Defendants' motion to strike Plaintiffs' reply to \nDefendants' opposition to Plaintiffs' request for leave to file supplemental findings of fact \nand conclusions of law (Docket no. 500) are moot. Judgment shall enter for Defendants. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n[1] Both Plaintiffs and Defendants expend significant effort in recounting the legislative history of the Boren \nAmendment, at issue in Wilder, in order to posit whether Wilder is still good law afterGonzaga. The Court's task in \nreconsidering the JOP Order is not necessarily to revisit its reliance onWilder. Rather, the Court's focus is to analyze \nthe elements of the intended beneficiary inquiry, as a whole, post-Gonzaga. \n\n[2] \"No funds shall be made available under any applicable program to any educational agency or institution which \nhas a policy or practice of permitting the release of education records (or personally identifiable information contained \ntherein ...) of students without the written consent of their parents to any individual, agency or organization.\" 20 \nU.S.C. § 1232g(b)(1), quoted in Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 279, 122 S.Ct. 2268.

Excerpts of Record hereinafter \"ER\" 1/1/7 _\n[Complaint ¶ 15]. The subject matter jurisdiction of the District Court over the\nclaims in this matter arises under 28 U.S.C. 88 1331 and 1343. The order of the\nCourt below dated August 6, 2002, ER 10/253/1-59 granted summary judgment\nagainst Plaintiffs on two of Plaintiffs' three claims. The Court's order of August\n6, 2002 did not, however, contain \"an express determination that there is no just\nreason for delay\" or \"for the entry ofjudgrnent\" under Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 54 (b). The order of the Court below dated January 5, 2004 (which was\nentered January 6, 2004) granted judgment on the pleadings against Plaintiffs on\ntheir third claim and terminated the entire case on the merits. ER 10/507/1-11 and\n10/508/1-3. Thus both the Court's August 6, 2002 order and its January 6, 2004\ntThe Excerpts of Record (\"ER\") are contained in ten volumes. Each volume contains one\nor more tabs corresponding to the number in the docket of the court below where the item\nreferred to is filed. Pagination of the contents of each tab begins with 1. References to the\nExcerpts of Record are in the form: Volume Number/Tab Number/Page Number.\n\norder first became appealable on January 6, 2004. The Notice of Appeal in this\naction was filed on February 4, 2004. ER 10/510/1-4. This Court has appellate\njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\nSTATEMENT OF THE ISSUES PRESENTED FOR REVIEW\n1. Do the Plaintiffs, developmentally disabled Medicaid recipients and\ntheir advocates, have a private fight of action to enforce the Medicaid Act's 42\nU.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A) fight to payments consistent with quality of care and\naccess to services in the community through the Civil Rights Act, 47 U.S.C. §\n19837\n2. Did the Court below, in granting Defendants' Motions for Summary\nJudgment on Plaintiffs' deinstitutionalization claims under Title II of the\nAmericans With Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act err: (a)\nby making determinations against Plaintiffs that ignored evidence which creates\nmaterial issues of fact; and (b) by applying incorrect legal principles.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThis action was instituted on May 4, 2000 by the filing of a complaint ER\n1/1/1-39 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.\nThe complaint sought injunctive and declaratory relief under: (1) Title XIX of the\nSocial Security Act (the Medicaid Act), 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq. (particularly 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A)); and (2), under Title II of the Americans with\nDisabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134 and Section 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (a) andregulations thereunder. Enforcement\nof the Medicaid Act claims was premised on 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\nThe complaint sought certification of a classof persons with developmental\ndisabilities. Seven individual developmentally disabled individuals, eachthrough\nhis or her mother or parents asnext friend, were named asplaintiffs and class\nrepresentatives. Also named asplaintiffs were six organizations engaged in\nadvocacy on behalf of persons with developmental disabilities. ER 1/1/13-18\n[Complaint ¶ 54-69]. Defendants are four individuals served in their capacities as\nofficials of the Stateof California charged with managing California's programs\nfor the developmentally disabled aswell asadministering California's Medicaid\nprograms for the developmentally disabled. ER 1/1/70-73 and 1/9/7-8 [Complaint\n¶70-73; Answer ¶70-73].\nAn answer was filed on June22, 2000. ER 1/9/1-20. On August 2, 2001,\nthe Court below granted Plaintiffs' (renewed) motion for class certification. ER\n1/108/1-14.\nOn September 24, 2001, the Court below denied Defendants' Motion for\nPartial Judgment on the Pleadings ER 1/136/1-20, andon February 28, 2002, the\n\nCourt below denied Defendants' application for certification to take an\nInterlocutory Appeal from that denial. ER 1/156/1-8. Both the Court's September\n24, 2001 and February 28, 2002 orders and opinions involved the Court's holding,\ninter alia, that Plaintiffs were entitled to enforce rights granted to them under the\nMedicaid Act's section, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A) by meansof 42 U.S.C. §\n1983. The decision denying certification went on to saythat \"there are not\nsubstantial grounds for difference of opinion asto whether § 1396a(a)(30)(A) is\njudicially enforceable and provides a private causeof action under Section 1983\".\nER 1/156/4.\nDuring March, April and early May of 2002, Plaintiffs and Defendants filed\ncross-motions for summary judgment with respect to various aspectsof the case.\nExtensive exhibits, declarations and objections to evidence were also filed. See\nthe docket of the Court below atnumbers 162-176, 178-189, 195-208, 211-219,\n227-231,238. ER 10/Docket Entries/25-32.\nBy anopinion and order dated August 6, 2002, ER 10/253/1-59 the Court\nbelow ruled on the cross motions for summary judgment. The Court denied all of\nPlaintiffs' motions for summary judgment andgranted in part and denied in part\nDefendants' motions for summary judgment. In particular, the Court's opinion\ngranted summary judgment on Plaintiffs' ADA and Section 504 claims that the\n\nstatehad discriminated by failing to setpayment rates high enough to provide\nsufficient disabilities services in an integrated community setting forcing persons\nto remain in segregated institutional settings. Plaintiffs' claim alleged that the\nrates for direct careworkers' wages andbenefits in community facilities were so\nlow asto reduce the availability of community placements. The Court determined\nthat 1)Plaintiffs hadnot shown that the instances of developmentally disabled\npersons unable to move into the community were widespread and more than\n'isolated' and 'sporadic'; (2) that Plaintiffs hadfailed to demonstrate that there is\nacasual link between the low level of wages andbenefits for direct Careworkers\nin community programs and the failure to deinstitutionalize developmentally\ndisabled persons; (3) that California had a \"comprehensive plan\" to adequately\nmove persons on \"a waiting list\" for deinstitutionalization; and (4) the dollar cost\nof the relief demanded by Plaintiffs would constitute \"a fundamental alteration\" of\nCalifornia's developmental disabilities budget. In arriving at theseconclusions\nthe Court improperly made determinations of disputed facts adverse to Plaintiffs\naswell asmisconstrued the scopeof the fundamental alteration defense.\nThe August 6, 2002 opinion of the Court below denied Plaintiffs' motion\nfor summaryjudgment on its claims under the Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396\na(a)(30)(A) and also denied Defendants' motion for summary judgment asto\n\nwhether Defendants had violated the \"quality of care\" and \"access\" portions of the\nMedicaid Acts 42 U.S.C. § 1396 a(a)(30)(A) andordered the caseto go forward\non theseissueswith submission of awritten record. ER 10/253/50-52; 56-57.\nFollowing August 6, 2002, for aperiod of almost ayear, the parties took\ndiscovery and filed evidence additional to that which had been taken and\nsubmitted, including written testimony of anumber of experts. Seee.g. Docket\nentries 297-330; 332-365; 367-368; 376-380; 383-395; 397-412; 414-417; 419-\n420; 428; 438; 452-454; 469-471. ER 10/Docket Entries/38-53.

Ibid.\nOn August 6, 2003, in the midst of this exchange of proposed Findings of\nFact andConclusions of Law, Defendants filed amotion seeking to have the Court\nbelowreconsider, in light of Gonzaga University, et al v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273\n(2002), its previous decisions holding Plaintiffs were entitled to enforce the\nMedicaid Acts', 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A) through 42 U.S.C. § 1983. After\nbriefing, the issue was submitted to the Court in late September of 2003.\nBy an opinion and order dated January 5, 2004 and reported at 301\n\nF.Supp.2d 1060 (N.D. Calif, 2004)(entered January 6, 2004), ER 10/507/1-11 the\nCourt below reversed the findings of its opinions of September 24, 2001 and\nFebruary 28, 2002 and held that neither Plaintiff Medicaid recipients nor Plaintiff\nMedicaid providers and advocacy organizations could enforce the \"access\" or\n\"quality of care\" mandates of the Medicaid Act's 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A) by\nmeansof 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The order of January 5, 2004 accordingly disposed of\nwhat remained of Plaintiffs' case.\nA Notice of Appeal was filed by Plaintiffs February 4, 2004 ER 10/510/1-4\nwith respect to the Court below's January 5, 2004 order aswell asthat of August\n6, 2002.\nSUMMARY OF TIlE FACTS\nThis caseconcerns how California caresfor more than 180,000 individuals\nwith developmental disabilities. Of these, approximately 3800 live in large,\ncongregate institutions known as Developmental Centers (DCs) which are directly\noperated by California through its Department of Developmental Services (DDS).\nER 9/245/16; 2/166/3-32; 7/187/5 [Exh. P-7, Page 16; Lakin & Braddock Decl. ¶¶\n12-13; Carleton Decl. ¶ 13]. The balance receive care under one of a number of\nprograms in community-based residential facilities, day care facilities or at home.\nIbid. Most of the care provided to this vast majority of developmentally disabled\n\nconsumers in community residential, day andhome programs is under contracts\ncontrolled by DDS. ER7/187/1-17 [Carleton Decl.].\nIn the 1960s,California enacted a comprehensive law entitled the\nDevelopmental Disabilities Services Act (and known as the \"Lanterman Act\").\nCalifornia Welfare and Institutions Code (Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code) §§4500-4846.\nThe Lanterman Act provided for the establishment of 21 Regional Centers (RCs)\nwhich were to manage, but not necessarily directly provide, care for\ndevelopmentally disabled individuals not residing in the DCs. RCs arenon-profit\norganizations independent of the state. ER 7/187/3 [Carleton Decl. ¶6]. Under the\nAct, the RCs either furnish or coordinate the services provided to individuals with\ndevelopmental disabilities Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code §4020, 4630, 4648). DDS\nestablishesuniform systemsof accounting, budgeting andreporting §463 l(a) and\nsetsthe rates for community, day andhome carewhich is provided by or through\nthe RCs §§4681, 4689 and4690. Ratesfor residential care in Intermediate Care\nFacilities (ICF) are setby the Department of Health Services headedby\nDefendant, Secretary of Health. ER 7/188/2-3; 6/181/3 [Dent Decl. ¶3, Tamai\nDecl. ¶3]. DDS setsrates for residential care in Community Care Facilities\n(CCFs), aswell ashome-based care through Family Home Agencies (FHAs),\nFoster Family Agency (FFAs), Independent Living Programs (ILPs) and\n\nSupported Living Services (SLS) which support various programs for consumers\nin private homes. DDS also setsrates for and funds through RCs avariety of non-\nresidential day programs to assist consumers. The delivery of community\nresidential, day andhome-based services in California to the developmentally\ndisabled is, accordingly, madeby a large array of providers other than the state\nitself.\nFederal dollars constitute asignificant portion of the total dollars which\nfund California's program for the developmentally disabled, both those conducted\ndirectly by the State through the DCs, aswell asthose which fund the residential,\nday and home programs which are delivered by the RCs or providers under\ncontract with the RCs. ER 7/187/11; 6/181/3 [Carleton Decl. ¶¶ 32-33, Tamai\nDecl. ¶3]. Most of these federal dollars flow out of the Medicaid program\nestablished under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396 -\n1396(v). Medicaid \"authorizes federal grants to statesfor medical assistance of\nlow income persons who are aged,blind, disabled, or members of families with\ndependent children. This program isjointly financed by the federal andstate\ngovernments and is administered by the states. The states,in accordance with\nfederal laws, decide eligible beneficiary groups, types and ranges of service,\npayments of services, and administrative and operational procedures. Payment for\n\nservices is made directly by the statesto the individuals or entities furnishing the\nservices. 42 C.F.R. § 430.0. To receive matching federal financial participation\nfor such services, statesmust agree to comply with the applicable federal Medicaid\nLaw.\" Orthopaedic Hospital v. Belshe, 103 F.3d 1491, 1493 (9_ Cir. 1997) cert.\ndenied, 521 U.S. 1116 (1998). \"Thus, for those States that opt to participate in the\nprogram, the requirements of the Medicaid Act are mandatory.\" Antrican v..\nOdom, 290 F.3D 178, 188 (4_ Cir. 2002). \"The Medicaid Act requires a\nparticipating state to develop a state plan which describes the policy and methods\nto be used to set payments rates for each type of service included in the program.\nC.F.R. § 447.201(b)\" Orthopaedic, su__u_p_1_0,3 F.3d at 1494.\nOne of the purposes of the Medicaid Act with regard to developmentally\ndisabled individuals is to \"enable[el each State... to furnish.., rehabilitation and\nother services to help such families and individuals attain or retain the capacity for\nindependence and self-care.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1396. (Emphasis added).\nCalifornia and every other state has elected to join Medicaid. Under\nMedicaid, the federal government pays a share of the costs of covered programs\nwhich in the case of most of the California programs at issue in the instant appeal\nis 50%. ER 7/187/11; 6/181/3 [Carleton Decl. ¶32, Tamai Decl. ¶3]. The services\nwhich California provides the developmentally disabled directly in DCs or\n10\n\nindirectly through private providers in facilities known asIntermediate Care\nFacilities (ICFs) may be eligible for Medicaid reimbursement. ER 7/187/I 1\n[Carleton Decl. ¶ 32.] Finally, the care for developmentally disabled in smaller,\nresidential settings (CCFs), day and home-based programs may also be eligible for\nMedicaid reimbursement pursuant to the 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c) \"waiver\" program\nfor Home and Community-Based Services (\"HCBS\"). SeeER 4/172/117 [P. Exh.\n106at 1]\nThe HCBS waiver, like the overall stateMedicaid plan itself, is an\nagreement between California and the United Statessetting forth special\nconditions under which services may be provided to a group of developmentally\ndisabled persons. These services are eligible for Medicaid reimbursement if they\nwill avoid placement in aninstitution and if the cost is less than the cost of\ninstitutional care. Medicaid HCBS waivers areset-up with a defined number of\n\"slots.\" On July 1,2001 there were 31,570 enrolled, and on January 1,2002,\n35,403. California hasrequested andreceived approval to increase its slots to\n70,000 by October, 2005. ER 6/184/1 -13; 10/314/22-23 [Marquez Declaration,\nEx. A; Marquez Deposition pp. 32-33]\nCalifornia's recovery of federal dollars under the waiver program is low.\nCalifornia in 2000 ranked 43_din federal per capita payments under the HCBS\n11\n\nprogram. The U. S. average per capita federal payment was more than double the\nCalifornia per capita federal waiver payment. ER 2/166/22 [P. Ex. A. Declaration\nof Lakin and Braddock at 19]. New York with its smaller population received\n$600 million more in federal waiver funding than California ER 2/166/23 lid. at\n20]. The low utilization of community services by California can further be seen\nby the fact that the percentage of astate's total Medicaid expenditures expended\non HCBS and ICF-MR for persons with MR/DD in FY 2000 was lower in\nCalifornia than in any other state.ER 2/166/23 lid. at 23].\nThe parties disputed how much statespending on persons with disabilities\nwas unmatched by federal funds. The Defendants' submitted a declaration stating\n\"unmatched general fund expenditures for DDS programs was $790.2 million for\nfiscal year 1999-2000.\" ER 6/184/4-5 [Marquez Declaration at ¶9]. At a\nsubsequentdeposition sheadmitted this excluded $721 million in unmatched\nexpenditures on developmentally disabled persons by the departments of Health\nServices, Social Services and Rehabilitation even though Federal Financial\nParticipation under the HCBS program can bedrawn by the stateif the\nexpenditures aremade by other departments. ER 10/314/67-70 [Marquez\nDeposition, at 98-99 and 101-102].\nBoth the Lanterman Act aswell asthe Medicaid law contain provisions\n12\n\nwhich encourage placing developmentally disabled individuals in an environment\nwhich is the least restrictive -i.e. most integrated- and which avoids\n\"institutionalization\" whenever possible. In particular, the Medicaid Act's 42\nUSC § 1396n(c) encourages deinstitutionalization through useof HCBS waivers.\nOlmstead v. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581,601 (1999). It also encourages services which\nmaximize growth-i.e, acquisition of skills-and independence while eschewing\n\"custodial\" care.\nFinally, as more particularly detailed below, the mandates of Title II of the\nADA and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and regulations promulgated\nthereunder, as construed by the United States Supreme Count in Olmstead v.\nZimring, 527 U.S. 581 (1999), require, subject to certain conditions, that\ndevelopmentally disabled persons for whom the state provides services be served\nin \"the most integrated setting appropriate\", i.e. in community-based rather than\ninstitutional settings Id. at 599-603. As used hereafter in this brief the term\n\"community services\" for developmentally disabled people excludes services\nprovided in the DCs, but encompasses all of the services described above\nincluding the ICFs as well as other residential, day and home-based services.\nState data shows that California since 1990 has increased the numbers of\npersons receiving care in the community and decreased the number of persons\n13\n\nconfined to institutions. ER 10/253/18 [8/16/02 opinion at 18]. Spending on\ncommunity care hasalso increased significantly. ER 10/253/20 [8/6/02 opinion at\n20]. In recent years, however, placements into the community have slowed. ER\n10/253/18 [8/6/02 opinion at 18]. For the three years prior to the lower court's\ndecision admissions to the Development Centers was greater than discharges.\nIbid. Importantly, the Regional Centers had determined in aprocess called In re\nH__ hearings that persons in the Developmental Centers were capable of being in\nthe community but were not being placed dueto lack of spaces. ER 10/253/39-40\n[8/6/02 opinion at39-40]. The Defendants also submitted to Plaintiffs in response\nto a discovery request a list of 1125 persons entitled \"Developmental Center\nResidents That Have Been Recommended for Placement asof May, 2001\" ER\n7/215/1-56 [Ex. 1to Plaintiffs' Reply to Defendants' Opposition to Summary\nJudgment]. The statehas assertedthat thesepersons arenot all \"ready for\nplacement\" and are not a waiting list for community placement. The state,\nhowever, did not state what it meant by \"ready for placement\" nor what is\nnecessary to be on a \"waiting list.\" ER 6/183/7-8 [Jackson Decl. ¶17]\nPlaintiffs' also submitted evidence that the state did not have, at the time of\nthe summary judgment motions, any \"Olmstead\" plan for providing community\nplacements in accordance with a schedule which would timely provide placements\n14\n\nto those on a waiting list. That evidence consisted of a Declaration of Deborah\nDoctor that on April 25, 2002, after Defendants had filed their motion for\nsummary judgment, a public meeting was held to discuss beginning to formulate\nsuch a comprehensive plan. ER 8/218/1-5.\nDefendants' data shows that for every category of disability in\nDevelopmental Centers there are literally thousands more persons with that\nconfiguration of disability in the community. ER 2/169/I-3 [P.Ex. 51].\nThe quality of care mandate of the Medicaid program, contained in 42\nU.S.C. §1396a(a)(30)(A) quoted above must be viewed in light of the preference\nof Medicaid and the mandates of the Lanterman, ADA and Section 504 for\ncommunity vs. institutional treatment and for attainment of independence versus\ncustodial care. In 1998 HCFA found, inter alia, the state did not provide quality\ncare and suspended additional enrollments in the HCBS Waiver Program until\nOctober 2000. HCFA Compliance Review, ER 4/172/119-123 [P.Ex. 106 at p.l-\n4].\nIn 1998 California formally abrogated using cost data for setting rates for\nCCFs, day programs, in-home respite care and supported living services. WIC\n§§4690.4 and 4681.1. Despite legislative direction to develop a new methodology,\nno new regulations have been adopted. The legislative abolishment of its rate\n15\n\nsetting formula merely confirmed the abandonment of a system which hadrarely\nbeen implemented.\nDDS admitted: \"In the last ten yearsthere hasbeen only one rate\nadjustment based on cost statements. The onerate adjustment provided in 1998-99\nis basedon 1995-96 cost statements, which were already depresseddue to a lack\nof biannual rate adjustments.\" ER 9/245/60 [Ex. P-3 at4]. \"The history of\ninadequate funding of the rate methodology hasresulted in the current crisis.... \"\nER 9/245/61 [Id. at 5]. For CCFs, no costdata hasbeen collected since 1988\ndespite legislation mandating triennial cost surveys.\nThe conclusion that California's community services for the\ndevelopmentally disabled fail to meet quality of carebecause of inadequate wages\ncausing high turnover andhigh level's of vacancies derives from Defendants' own\nadmissions and the Report of California's StateAuditor.\nIn the May Revision of Defendants' 2001-2002 Budget Change Proposal for\nthe RC Service Delivery Reform Rate Stabilization, Defendants admitted that:\n\"Since the current rate methodologies were introduced beginning\nnearly 13 years ago, rate increases havenot kept pace with the cost of\nproviding services (cf., Endnotel). The growing gap between the\ncost of doing business and rates means service providers struggle to\nprovide quality services without being able to offer competitive\nwages and benefits ....\n• o . . .\n16\n\nSince the relationship between consumer or family and service\nprovider is essential to the provision of quality services, turnover and\ninexperienced staff hasled to gapsin service provision, lengthy waits\nto receive services and the high cost of repeatedly training anew and\ninexperienced workers. Additionally, inexperienced staff expose\nconsumers and families to unnecessaryhealth and safety issues.\"\nER 9/245/158-159 [P.Ex. 10atpp 1-2(DDS-20379-080)].\nIn another Budget Change Proposal, for Fiscal Year 2000-2001, the\nDepartment stated: \"The historic lack of fully funding the rate methodology has\nresulted in the current direct service professional turnover rate and the associated\nreduction in quality of services to consumers and families.\" ER 9/245/83 [Exhibit\nP-4, at 5].\nThe lower court at page 28 of its 8/6/02 opinion, ER 10/253/28, drew the\nsame conclusion, stating:\n\"DDS has acknowledged the potential for low quality services due to low\nreimbursement rates, which result in low wages and benefits and high turnover\nand vacancy rates. With regard to quality of care in community day programs,\nDDS has stated:\nWithout funding sufficient to recruit, train, and retain a\nskilled labor force, the Department puts at significant\nrisk the health, safety, and well-being of consumers ....\nPls' Ex. P-4 at DDS-16732..See also Pls.' Ex. P-3 at DDS-005126 (\"The\nDepartment concludes that a lack of additional funding sufficient to reduce staff\nturnover will cause service quality decline, adversely affecting over 77,000\nconsumers and families.\")\n17\n\nDDS hasvoiced its concern multiple times about diminishing quality of services\nby failing to fund rate increases.\nResearch on staff compensation andturnover supports\nconcerns about quality of care .... Direct care staff\nturnover is directly linked to the quality of care. The\neffects of staff turnover on care include discontinuity of\ntreatment and care, inability to implement individual\nprogram plans, increasedrisk to health and safety, and\nchronic staff shortages.\nPls. Ex. P-2 at DDS-19052.\"\nA 1999 study by the California StateAuditor, submitted to but not cited by\nthe Court below, found that the turnover rate of direct care workers was 50%,\nalong with high vacancy rates. It concluded, asdid DDS, that the turnover wasa\nconsequence of the low wages andreimbursement rates. The StateAuditor found\nthe averagewage for a direct support professionals working in community\nservices to be statewide $18,500 annually based on the average hourly wage.\nSixty-one percent of providers did not offer benefits such ashealth insurance or\nsick leave or retirement. ER 4/172/23, 46, 60 [P. Exh. P-101 pp. 1,23, 37].\nIn his letter of conveyance, the StateAuditor wrote:\n\"This report concludes that although the State's service delivery\nsystem was designed to provide optimal services to consumers, its\nsuccess has been undermined by insufficient state funding and budget\ncuts. The providers we surveyed unequivocally agree that their\ninability to compete for direct care staff--those individuals who work\ndirectly with the consumers--and receiving insufficient state\n18\n\nfinancial support are the primary obstacles to consistently delivering\nquality services. Providers report that most of their direct care staff,\nwho earn an average of $8.89 per hour, remain on the job barely two\nyears. It takes providers almost three months to replace these staff,\nthus creating disruptions in services and impeding continuity for the\nconsumers.\"\nER 4/172/23 [Ex. P. 101 p. 1]\nThe constant cost of continuous arduous recruitment, orientation, training\nand supervision of new employees and of the constantly necessary extra-intensive\nsupervision of underqualified, inexperienced, untrained direct care workforce is\nlarge. It doubles around to further diminish the already insufficient resources of\nservice providers to deliver and to achieve quality in the services they have\nundertaken by contract with the Regional Centers to provide, consuming the\nresources necessary to design and provide new services for people who are waiting\nfor them. ER 8/217/140 and 8/217/166 [P. Exh. C, _ at 132 and Exh. 6 to P.\nExh. C].\nDefendants admit that:\n\"In 1997-98, given a turnover rate averaging 61% (Institute for\nSocial and Behavioral Research, Kansas State University), it is\nestimated that California service providers spent $63.5 million, or\n18% of total adult day service expenditures, replacing staff.\nTherefore, the $31.9 million allocated for 1999-00 day program,\ninfant, and in-home respite services rate increase did not fund the cost\nof replacing staff, much less allow for wage and benefit increases.\"\n19\n\nER 9/245/60-61 [P. Exh. P-3 at4-5].\nFor the fiscal years 2001-2002, California budgeted $2,057,803,000 for the\nCommunity Services Program and$617,831,000 for the Developmental Centers\nProgram ER 4/173/4 [P. Ex 119] or a total of $2,675,634,000. The Developmental\nCentersprogram, thus, accounted for about 23% of the total, even though, as\nnoted above, the population of the Developmental Centers is only about 2% of the\ndevelopmentally disabled in the California System.\n20\n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nAlthough Gonzaga Universi .tyv.Doe, 536 U.S. 273 (2002) directs courts to\ndetermine whether a statute creates individual rights by looking at the \"text and\nstructure\" of the statute, the court below concluded that Section 30(A) of the\nMedicaid Act does not create enforceable rights solely by looking at whether it\nhad \"rights creating language.\" Section 30(A) must be considered in the context\nof a Medicaid statute which creates entitlements to services enforceable by\nrecipients under Section 1983. The Congressional mandates in Section 30(A) to\nquality and access are an integral part of the entitlements created. The structure of\nthe entire Act, its legislative history, and the enactment of the Suter v. Artist M.\noverride provisions confirm the Congressional intent to create an enforceable right\nin Section 30(A). The lower court's conclusion that Section 30(A) was\nunenforceable because it has an aggregate focus overlooked the fact that the\nSupreme Court reached the opposite conclusion in the Wilder case involving a\nnearly identical provision. By contrast with the opinion below, the well reasoned\ndecision in Clayworth v. Bonta, 295 F.Supp.2d 1110 (E.D.Calif. 2003), appeal\npending, held Section 30(A) creates rights enforceable under Section 1983.\nConsequently, the order dismissing on the pleadings Plaintiffs' claim that Section\n30(A) has been violated by the state's failure to assure payments at a level\n21\n\nconsistent with quality of care for persons with developmental disabilities\nreceiving community based services must be remanded for determination of that\nclaim on a full record.\nTo grant Defendants' motion for summary judgment on the ADA and\nSection 504 claims the court had to improperly resolve numerous issues of\ndisputed material facts. (1) The court's holding that Plaintiffs had not shown more\nthan sporadic or isolated instances of developmentally disabled persons living in\ninstitutions unable to obtain community based placements ignored the list of 1125\npersons \"recommended for placement\" in Defendants' own records, the declining\nnumber of placements from institutions, and other records of institutionalized\npersons unable to find placements in the community. (2) The holding that\nPlaintiffs failed to demonstrate a causal link between low wages for direct care\nworkers and the lack of available community placements overlooks the fact that\nDefendants admitted that they themselves have doubled the payment rates in order\nto place persons under the Community Placement Plan process. Although\nPlaintiffs introduced Defendants' records to show there already are persons in the\ncommunity with the same severity of problems as persons in the institutions, the\ncourt improperly concluded that it was the nature of the disabilities which was\nslowing the pace of placements out of the institutions, and not the financial\n22\n\npolicies of Defendants. (3) The Court's finding that the statehad a\n\"comprehensive plan\" for moving persons out of institutions and into the\ncommunity \"at areasonable pace\" that satisfied the \"Olmstead\" requirements\nignored a declaration that no such plan hadbeen started to be developed, the fact\nthat more persons arebeing admitted than discharged, and that it would take at\nleast 12years to take care of those persons recommended for placement atthe rate\nproposed for the next two years. (4) The final disputed issue arises from the\ncourt's conclusion that the cost of relief would constitute a \"fundamental\nalteration\" of the state's disabilities program. The statenever established how\nmuch it would cost to raise wages sufficiently to create the necessary\nplacements-the Court useda figure for raising wages of persons already served in\nthe community. The Plaintiffs and Defendants disputed how much money was\navailable from new federal reimbursements available against unmatched current\nstateexpenditures. Plaintiff's experts said there was $1.2 billion in unmatched\nexpenditures; Defendants' expert said there was only $790 million unmatched and\nthe most that could be raised in five years was $115 million. The court improperly\nresolved this dispute by dismissing Plaintiffs' estimate. Evidence admitted in\nconnection with the Medicaid claim shows that within two years the statebudget\nincluded a$285 million increase in Federal funds andthat the Defendants' expert\n23\n\nadmitted that there was another $721 million in unmatched stateexpenditures not\nincluded in the earlier declaration.\nSummary judgment on the ADA andSection 504 claims should be reversed\nandthe caseremanded for consideration upon a full record on which these\ncontestedissues could beproperly resolved.\n24\n\nARGUMENT\nI. Section 1396a(a)(30(A) of the Medicaid Act Creates Rights Enforceable\nunder Section 1983.\nJudge Wilken held that Gonzaga Universi _tyv. Doe, 536 US 273 (2002),\nchanged the standard for determining whether a statute creates rights enforceable\nunder 42 U.S.C. Section 1983 so drastically that Section 1396a(a)(30)(A) of the\nMedicaid Act, which several Courts of Appeals as well as she twice previously,\nhad held enforceable by Medicaid recipients, no longer is enforceable. In doing\nso, the court disregarded the continuing vitality of the Supreme Court's decision in\nWilder v.Virginia Hosp. Ass'n., 496 U.S. 498 (1990), unduly focused on one\ncriteria for determining whether Congress intended to create individual rights, and\nignored important Congressional directives and legislative history. 2\nThe Supreme Court has frequently referred to parts of the Social Security\nAct, which includes Medicaid, as entitlements, because Congress votes open\nended appropriations to cover the costs so that whomever is eligible can receive\nthe services to which they are entitled (42 USC §1396), and because those\nCongressional directives are binding upon state officials and can be enforced by\n2ThisCourt reviews de novo the entry by the Court below ofjudgment on the pleadings\nEnron Oil Trading & Transportation Co. v.

Wyman, 397\nU.S. 397, 422-3 (1970) (It is... peculiarly part of the duty of this tribunal, no less\nin the welfare field than in other areas of the law, to resolve disputes as to whether\nfederal funds allocated to the States are being expended in consonance with the\nconditions that Congress has attached to their use.\"); Schweiker v. Gray Panthers,\n453 US 34, 36-7 (1981)(\"An individual is entitled to Medicaid if he fulfills the\ncriteria established by the state in which he lives.\"). In Pennhurst State School\nand Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17-8 Justice Rhenquist pointed to the Social\nSecurity Act as a model of where, when Congress \"intended the States to fund\ncertain entitlements as a condition of receiving federal funds, it has proved capable\nof saying so explicitly\" citing to King v. Smith, supra.\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 provides a claim for relief against any person who, acting\nunder color of state law, deprives a person \"of any rights, privileges, or immunities\nsecured by the Constitution and laws.\" To enforce that right, a plaintiff\"must\nassert the violation of a federal right, not merely a violation of federal law.\"\nBlessing v. Freestone, 520 US 329,340 (1997).\nThe most recent statement by the Supreme Court of how to determine if a\nfederal statute creates a federal right, Gonzaga University v. Doe, 536 US 273\n(2002), builds on a series of cases, including Wilder v. Virginia Hospital\n26\n\nAssociation, 496 US 498 (1990), Suter v. Artist M., 503 US 347 (1992), and\nBlessing v. Freestone, 520 US 329 (1997). Each of these cases, except Gonzaga,\ninvolved provisions of the Social Security Act.\nThat body of law applies a three-part test to determine whether a statute\ncreates enforceable fights: (1) Was the provision intended to benefit the plaintiff;\n(2) is the provision so \"vague and amorphous\" that its enforcement would strain\njudicial competence; and (3)does it unambiguously impose a binding obligation by\nusing mandatory, rather than precatory, language. Blessing at 340-I; Wilder at\n509. If a plaintiff meets these criteria, \"the right is presumptively enforceable\nunless the defendant demonstrates Congress has \"shut the door to private\nenforcement.\" Gonzaga University, _ 536 U.S. at 285, n.4.\nA. Gonzaga's Changes to Wilder Are Limited\nIn determining whether a statute was intended to benefit the plaintiff, the\nCourt in Gonzaga was concerned that \"[s]ome language in our opinions might be\nread to suggest that something less than an unambiguously conferred fight is\nenforceable by §1983.\" 536 US at 282. \"This confusion has led some courts to\ninterpret Blessing as allowing plaintiffs to enforce a statute under §1983 so long as\nthe plaintiff falls within a general zone of interest that the statute was intended to\nprotect[.]\" Id. The Court then clarified that \"it is rights, not the broader or vaguer\n27\n\n'benefits' or 'interests,' that may beenforced under the authority of that section.\"\nId. (Emphasis in original). The Court concluded that the language \"simply\nrequire[s] a determination as to whether or not Congress intended to confer\nindividual rights upon a class of beneficiaries.\" Id. at 286.\nIn analyzing whether Congress intended to confer individual rights, the\nGonzaga Court looked at the same factors that it had looked at in earlier cases,\nincluding \"the text and structure of a statute\" to see if they provide any \"indication\nthat Congress intended to create new individual rights\" 536 US at 286, whether\nthere is \"rights creating language\" 536 US at 287, whether the structure of the act\nindicated individual enforcement and whether the provision is concerned with\n\"institutional policy and practice\" or rights of individuals. 536 U.S. at 288. The\nCourt placed significant emphasis on the fact that under FERPA there is a\nstructure by which students and others can bring administrative complaints about a\nviolation of FERPA. 536 U.S. at 289. By contrast, there is no provision in the\nMedicaid Act which provides recipients with a comparable structure to obtain\nrelief from the state's failure to comply with Section 30(A). Indeed, Gonzaga\npoints out that \"These [FERPA] administrative procedures squarely distinguish\nthis case from Wright and Wilder, where an aggrieved individual lacked any\nfederal review mechanism.\" 536 U.S.at 289-90.\n28\n\nB. Wilder Was Not Overruled and its Conclusion Still Is Valid\nIn Wilder the Supreme Court had before it the enforcement of the Boren\nAmendment to Title XIX, 42 USC §1396a(a)(13)(A)(1982 ed. Supp.V) which\nprovided that states must:\n\"use rates (determined in accordance with methods and standards\ndeveloped by the State...)which the State finds.., are reasonable\nand adequate.., in order to provide care and services...and to\nassure that individuals have reasonable access...to...services of\nadequate quality.\"\nThe Court held that Section 13(A) conferred on providers an \"enforceable\nright\" to reasonable and adequate rates. 496 US at 510-20. All four courts of\nappeals which had previously considered the matter had arrived at the same\nconclusion. Id. at n.16. As the Third Circuit Court of Appeals recently noted,\nnothing in Gonzaga alters the fundamental principles set forth in Wilder nor the\nreasoning that led the Wilder court to find that § 1396a(a)(13)(A) bestowed\nenforceable rights. Sabree v. Richman, 2004 U.S. App. Lexis 9180 (3rdCir. May\n11, 2004).\nC. The Access and Quality Provisions of Section 30(A) are Intended to\nBenefit Medicaid Recipients.\nThe provision at issue here is that found at 42 USC §1396a(a)(30)(A) which\nprovides that states must:\n29\n\n\"provide such methods andprocedures relating to the utilization of,\nand the payment for care and services available under the plan...as\nmay be necessary...to assurethat payments are consistent with\nefficiency, economy, andquality of care andare sufficient to enlist\nenough providers so that careand services are available under the\nplan atleast to the extent that such care and services areavailable to\nthe general population in the geographic area.\"\nJudge Wilken, focusing solely on the statements in Gonzaga looking for\nrights creating language, held this provision did not show an intention to create\nindividual rights and that it concerns aggregate results rather than individual\nrights. By contrast, Judge Levi in Clayworth v. Bonta, 295 F.Supp.2nd 1110 (E.D.\nCal. 2003), decided a week before, concluded that the provision creates individual\nrights enforceable by beneficiaries.\nWhen the text and structure of Section 30(A) are taken together, as\nGonzaga directs, they demonstrate Congressional intention to create an\nenforceable right for beneficiaries. The requirement of payments sufficient \"to\nassure ...quality of care\" and access \"at least to the extent that such care and\nservices are available to the general population\" are solely for the direct benefit of\nthe service recipients. These provisions, in contrast to the requirements of\npayments consistent with economy and efficiency, do not further the objectives of\nthe state; they are to protect the interests of the service beneficiaries by directing\nthat state payments be sufficient in amount to attain these objectives which are in\n3O\n\nthe statute for the sole purpose to benefit the service recipients. While other\nprovisions of the Act create the entitlement to services, this provision sets forth\none of the standards for determining the nature, scope, and availability of the\nservices which must be provided to the Medicaid recipient. When read with the\nclear entitlement provisions set forth in 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(8) and (a)(10), 3\nthis section is a description of the services to which individuals have rights.\nThe lower court, however, objected that the provision does not use rights\ncreating language like \"no person shall be deprived\" and noted that the Supreme\nCourt found the absence of such language highly relevant in construing the Family\nEducational Rights and Privacy Act, which provided '\"No funds shall be made\navailable...to any educational agency or institution which has a policy or practice\nof permitting the release of education records .... \"301 F.Supp.2d 1060, 1063-64.\nHowever, the Supreme Court, had not relied solely on the absence of such\n3 The court below apparently was influenced by the district court decision in Sabree v.\nHouston, 245 F.Supp.2d 653 (E.D. PA.2003) holding that none of the state plan requirements in\n1396a are enforceable. That decision was reversed, sub nom Sabree v. Richman, 2004 U.S. App.\nLexis 9180 (3d Cir. May 11, 2004) by the Court of Appeals which carefully analyzed Gonzag_a\nand concluded that §§1396a(a)(8) and (a)(10) create individual entitlements enforceable pursuant\nto Section 1983. Section (a)(8) requires that the state plan \"provide...such [medical] assistance\nshall be furnished with reasonable promptness.., to all eligible individuals;\" Section (a)(10)\nrequires the plan \"must... provide...for making medical assistance available,.., to...all\n[eligible] individuals .... \"Earlier Appellate decisions enforcing §(a)8 or §(a)l 0 were B_._,sonv.\nShumwav, 308 F.3d 79 (1 stCir. 2002); Pediatric Specialty Care, Inc. v. Arkansas Dep't of\nHuman Services, 293 F.3d 472 (8thcir. 2002);. Westside Mothers v. Havemar_, 289 F.3d 852 (6th\nCir.), cert. denied, 123 S.Ct. 618 (2002); Doe 1-13 v. Chiles, 136 F.3d 709 (11_hCir. 1998).\n31\n\nlanguage, examining in addition the structure of FERPA which it found also\ndemonstrated no intention to create individual rights.\nIn looking for \"rights creating language\" similar to that found in Title VI\nand Title IX and which the Court found missing in Gonzaga, the lower court\nignored an important difference between the conditions in FERPA and those in the\nMedicaid Act. The FERPA conditions on the expenditure of federal funding are\nnot set forth as requirements of a state plan; the Medicaid conditions are. As\nJudge Levi noted in Clayworth, 295 F.Supp.2d at 1122 the language used is a\nfunction of its inclusion as a state plan requirement. In that context, the lower\ncourt failed to consider the impact of the Suter v. Artist M,, su_9_p_override\nprovision adopted by the Congress in 1992. In the Suter case the Supreme Court\nhad said, inter alia, that Social Security Act beneficiaries can not maintain an\naction to enforce a funding condition which the Act requires to be set forth in a\nstate plan. In response to the Surer case, Congress amended the Act to provide:\nIn an action brought to enforce a provision of the Social Security Act,\nsuch provision is not to be deemed unenforceable because of its\ninclusion in a section of the Act requiring a State plan or specifying\nthe required contents of a State plan.\"\n42 USC §1320a-2; accord 42 USC §1320a-10.\nIn enacting this statute, Congress recognized the importance of suits\n32\n\nenforcing stateplan conditions:\nSocial Security beneficiaries, parents, and advocacy groups have\nbrought hundreds of successful lawsuits alleging failure of the State\nand/or locality to comply with Stateplan requirements of the Social\nSecurity Act .... Much of this litigation hasresulted in comprehensive\nreforms of Federal-State programs operated under the Social Security\nAct, and increased compliance with the mandates of the Federal\nstatutes.\nH.R. Rep. No. 102-631, at 364-65 (1992).\nAs aresult, two years after Wilder Congress endorsed and codified that\ndecision's implied causeof action analysis. \"The purpose of this provision is to\nassurethat individuals who have been injured by astate's failure to comply with\nthe stateplan requirements areable to seekredress in the federal courts to the\nsameextent they were able to prior to the decision in Suter v. Artist M.\" H.R.\nConf. Rep. No. 102-1034 at 1304 (1992)(quoting H.R. Rep. No. 102-631 at 366\n(1992)).\nAs the court in Clayworth, 295 F.Supp. at 1122 noted, it is not surprising\nthat classic rights creating language is not used in the context of rights expressed\nas part of a state plan requirement. Congress in Section 1320a-2 has told the\ncourts that conditions set forth as requirements of state plans shall not be\nconsidered any less worthy of enforcement, a provision which the court below did\nnot consider in assessing the import of the language used by Congress in Section\n33\n\n30(A).\nThe second criteria used by the court below to find no intention to createa\nright was its conclusion that Section 30(A) has an\"aggregate focus\" speaking to\n\"institutional policy or practice\" because it speaksto the state's obligation to\ndevelop \"methods and procedures.\" That conclusion again overlooks the\nsimilarity of Section 30(A) and the Boren Amendment upheld in Wilder. In\nSection 30(A) the stateis directed to use\"methods andprocedures.., asmay be\nnecessary...to assurethat payments are consistent with...quality of careand are\nsufficient to enlist enough providers .... \" In Section 13(A) upheld in Wilder the\nstateis directed to \"use rates (determined in accordance with methods and\nstandards developed by the State)... to assurethat individuals have reasonable\naccess...to...services of adequatequality.\" The substantive fight in .Wilder was\nto rates which were sufficient to provide reasonable accessand adequatequality.\nSimilarly under 30(A) the right is to payments which are consistent with quality\nand sufficient to provide enough providers. The \"methods and procedures;' of\nSection 30(A) and the \"methods and standards\" of Section 13(A) are merely the\nmeansthat the stateis required to use in satisfying its basic obligation.\nJudge Levi in the Clayworth case concluded that the quality and access\nrequirements of Section 30(A) \"are not phrased in aggregate or indirect terms -\n34\n\nsuch as requiring a general policy or requiring substantial compliance - that might\nsuggest that no single beneficiary is entitled to quality care or equal access.\" 295\nF.Supp.2d at 1122. Thus he required proof that individuals were being deprived\nof equal access and/or quality care and evidence that such deprivation was the\nresult of insufficient rates. 295 F.Supp.2d at 1127-8.\nD. The Legislative History Demonstrates a Congressional Intention to\nCreate Enforceable Rights.\nSince the ultimate touchstone of whether Section 30(A) confers a right to\nsue under Section 1983 is Congressional intent, in addition to statutory language,\nlegislative history is another guidepost. The legislative history demonstrates\nCongress intended, at the least, that Medicaid recipients are to be vested by the\nstatute with a right of action under 42 U.S.C. §1983.\nSection 30(A) was originally enacted in 1967 and amended in 1981. The\nThird Circuit described the legislative history as follows:\n\"...the effect of the 1981 amendment was to sharpen the focus on\nMedicaid beneficiaries. Language referring to providers' charges was\nremoved and language providing a further protection for beneficiaries\nwas added.\n\"... the House Committee Report on the 1981 amendment observed\nthat 'in instances where the States or the Secretary fail to observe\nthese statutory requirements, the courts would be expected to take\nappropriate remedial actions.' H.R.Rep. No. 158, 97'_Cong., 312-313\n35\n\n(1981).4 This statement certainly suggests that the committee\nanticipated that some class of plaintiffs would be able to sue to\nenforce Section 30(A), but it does not show that the Committee\nanticipated that Medicaid providers, as opposed to recipients, would\nbe able to do so.\nPennsylvania Pharmacists, 283 F.3d at 541 (Emphasis supplied).\nThis legislative history is strong evidence that the equal access and quality\nof care provisions of Section 30(A) were intended to be enforceable by Medicaid\nrecipients. There is a second piece of legislative history which further confirms\nCongressional intent that recipients have a right of action consistent with that\npermitted in Wilder for Section (13)(A), which is the Suter v. Artist M. override\nreferred to above. Concerned that Suter \"dramatically limits the ability of program\nbeneficiaries to enforce State plan titles of the Social Security Act\" H.R. Conf.\nRep. No. 102-1034, at 1304 (1992), the Congress endorsed and codified the\nanalysis of Wilder, with the House Conference Report declaring that the purpose\nof 42 U.S.C. §1320a-2 is to assure redress in the courts \"to the same extent...[as]\nprior to the decision in Suter v. Artist M.\" H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 102-631, at 634-5.\nE. Section 30(A) is Not Too Vague or Ambiguous to be Enforced.\nJudge Wilken in her January 5, 2004 opinion did not address the second\n4The quote from the Committee Report actually appears at p. 301 of the Report, not at\n312-313 as the opinion states.\n36\n\nprong of the Wilder test-whether the rights at issue are too vague and ambiguous\nfor judicial enforcement. In her September 24, 2001 opinion denying Defendants'\nMotion for Summary Judgment, however, she carefully addressed that issue and\nconcluded Section 30 (A) was not too vague or ambiguous to be enforced. See pp.\n7-8. ER 1/136/7-8. Judge Levi in Clayworth, _ had no difficulty in\nconcluding that equal access or availability of services equivalent to privately\ninsured persons is sufficiently definite for enforcement by courts, 295 F.Supp.2d at\n1123. The right in the Boren Amendment to services of adequate quality found\nenforceable in Wilder is nearly identical to Section 30(A)'s requirement for quality\ncare. This test was not changed by Gonzaga. As Judge Levi pointed out, this Court\nhas already construed and given content to the term \"quality of care\" in\nOrthopaedic Hosp. v. Belshe, 103 F.3d 1491 (9thCir. 1997). At a minimum\nBelshe means that the failure of the state in setting rates to consider providers'\ncosts creates a presumption that the complete range of required services can not be\ndelivered at effective levels, thereby violating the access and quality requirements.\n295 F.Supp. at 1127. The provision's enforceability is also demonstrated by the\nfact the Secretary has suspended certain Medicaid programs because of failures of\nservice quality, measured against program goals, and federal and state regulations.\nSee, for example, the HCFA \"Compliance Review of California's HCBS waiver\n37\n\nProgram for the Developmentally Disabled,\" January 12, 1998, ER 4/172/114-127.\nDefendants themselves have repeatedly issued statements requesting increases in\nSection 30(A) payment rates becauseof the impact on quality of care andaccess.\nSee,e.g.: \"Direct care staff turnover [resulting from insufficient rates] is directly\nlinked to the quality of care. The effects of staff turnover on care include\ndiscontinuity of treatment andcare, inability to implement individual program\nplans, increased risk to health and safety, andchronic staff shortages.\" ER\n9/245/25 [P-2 at DDS 19052] s\nF. No Appellate Court has Concluded that Recipients Can Not Enforce\nSection 30(A).\nThere is no appellate decision since Gonzaga which is directly on point. All\nfive of the Circuit Courts of Appeals to consider the enforceability of rates to\nassure access and quality of care prior to Gonzaga came to the same conclusion:\nthat Section 30(A) creates an individual right enforceable by Medicaid recipients,\nSThe Clavworth court's statement that there is \"no point of reference\" for quality 295\nF.Supp.2d at 1123, is only true if limited to the text of Section 30(A), but the Act itself, the CMS\nregulations, and the CMS Services and Standards for Waiver Applications provide points of\nreference. See, e.g. the opening language of Title XIX, 42 U.S.C.§1396: \"For the purpose of\nenabling each State... to furnish.., services to help... [disabled] individuals attain or retain\ncapabilities for independence or self care .... \"; 42 CFR §483.440 defining a standard for active\ntreatment: \"Each client must receive a continuous active treatment program, which includes\naggressive, consistent implementation of... services...that is directed toward-... (ii)the\nprevention or deceleration of regression or loss of current optimal functional status.\" Quality of\ncare includes maintaining safety and health standards. For children's health services under\n• I.\nMedicaid there exist guidelines setting forth required components of screens and the testing\nnecess_'u-y. See, e.g. 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(r).\n38\n\nfindinl' _that they are beneficiaries of the quality and access provisions of Section\n30(A) and that those provisions as clearly create rights as the similar provisions of\nSection 13(A) upheld in Wilder. They were split, however, on the issue of\nwheth('_r Section 30(A) created any rights for providers, with most courts of\nappears deciding that it did not. Pennsylvania Pharmacists Assn. v. Houstoun,\n283 F.3d 531 (3'_ Cir.)(en banc), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 821 (2002)(not enforceable\nby providers; enforceable by recipients (dicta)); Evergreen Presbyterian\nMinistries, Inc., 235 F.3d 908 (5_ Cir. 2000)(enforceable by recipients, not by\nproviders); Methodist Hospitals, Inc. v. Sullivan, 91 F.3d 1026 (7_ Cir.\n1996)(,enforceable by providers); Visiting Nurse Ass'n of North Shore, Inc. v.\nBullen, 93 F.3d 997 (1s'Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1114 (1997)(enforceable\nby providers); Arkansas Medical Society, Inc. v. Reynolds, 6 F.3d 519 (84 Cir.\n1993)(:enforceable by recipients and providers).\nIn the only post-Gonzaga appellate decision concerning Section 30(A) the\nFirst C.ircuit has now joined the list of courts holding that it does not provide\nexplicit rights for providers. Long Term Care Pharmacy Alliance v. Ferguson, 362\nF.3d 50 (1s'Cir. 2004). Although the opinion declares that Section 30(A) does not\ncontain rights creating language and does not identify any discrete class of\nbenefi,ziaries, it is careful to limit its conclusion that Section 30(A)'s language\n39\n\ndoes not suggest any \"intent to confer rights on a particular class of people\" by\nthen stating \"or at least not providers.\" 6 362 F.3d at 57.\n'In Pennsylvania Pharmacists the Court majority used the clarity of\nrecipients' rights under Section 30(A) as the basis for its conclusion that Section\nd\n30(A) does not confer a right of action upon providers because, as it emphatically\nnoted, the provision was focused on recipients' needs. The majority specifically\nnoted that the \"quality of care\" and adequate access provisions demonstrate\nCongressional intent to confer a right of action on Medicaid recipients:\n\"That leaves the directives to provide 'quality of care' and adequate\naccess. These directives are 'drafted... with an unmistakable focus\non' Medicaid beneficiaries, not providers. Cannon, 411 U.S. at 691.\nThey are 'phrased in terms benefitting' Medicaid recipients, Wilder,\n496 U.S. at 510 and these are the persons that Congress intended to\nbenefit.\"\n283 F.3d at 538.\nThe dissent, written by then Chief Judge Becker on behalf of five of the\npanel's eleven members, discussed Section 30(A) at length and concluded that it\nconfers an enforceable right to sue on both providers and recipients. 283 F.3d at\n6 A different panel of the First Circuit, also writing post-Gonzaga, upheld the\nenforceability of a different Medicaid provision, 42 USC § 1396r, holding recipients can enforce\nnursing facility Standards, based on the structure of the statute and legislative history in the\nabsence of any explicit rights creating language. Rolland v. Romney, 318 F.3d 42, 47-56 (1_tCir.\n2003). (\"We gather clues of congressional intent from several separate provisions in the statute,\never mindful of its overriding purpose, to protect individuals from being.., denied necessary\nservices.\" 318 F.3d at 48).\n4O\n\n544-560.\nPost Gonzaga, there has been no District Court decision, other than the one\nunder review here, which concluded that Section 30(A) can not be enforced by\nbeneficiaries, except for the court in Sabree v. Houston, 245 F.2d 653 (E.D.Pa.\n2003) which concluded no provision of 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a) could be enforced.\nThat decision, as noted above, was overruled by the Third Circuit Court of\nAppeals, sub nom Sabree v. Richman., 2004 U.S. App. Lexis 9180 (3d Cir. May\n11,2004). Three district courts post Gonzaga have concluded that recipients can\nenforce Section 30(A): Association of Residential Resources v. Goodno, 2003\nU.S. Dist. Lexis 15056 (D.Minn) (providers and recipients); American Society of\nConsultant Pharmacists v. Concannon, 214 F.Supp.2d 23 (D.Me. 2002); and\nClayworth v. Bonta, 295 F.Supp.2d 1110 (E.D. Calif. 2003)(recipients\nonly)(pending on appeal). Three other district courts have post Gonzaga found that\nSection 30(A) does not confer rights on providers: California Association of\nHealth Facilities v. State Dept. of Health Services, Case No. C. 03-736\n(VRW)(N.D.Cal. 2003); Burlington United Methodist Family Services, Inc. v.\nAtkins_, 227 F.Supp.2d 593,596 (D.W.Va. 2002)(noting \"quality of care\" and\n\"adequate access\" provisions are \"drafted...with an unmistakable focus\" on\nMedicaid beneficiaries.); and Belen Consolidated Schools v. Otten, 259 F.Supp.2d\n41\n\n1203 (D.N.Mex. 2003). Sanders v. Kansas Department of Soc. and Rehab.\nServices, 2004 U.S. Dist. Lexis 8572, concluded in contrast to Sabree. that Section\n8 is not enforceable and in dicta opined Section 30(A) is not enforceable. Id. at 40\nConclusion\nGonzaga does not overrule Wilder and subsequent case law, but more\nmodestly attempts to clarify it. It is not a decision concerning the Medicaid Act\nand it did not seek to up-end the considerable judical and legislative history\naffirming Congressional intent to create entitlements and rights enforceable by\nrecipients. More particularly, Gonzaga does not say that rights creating language\nmust appear in any particular place or way; it does say courts are to look at the text\nand structure and legislative history of the statute. Section 30(A), with its clear\ndirection that state reimbursements assure quality of care and access to service,\ndefines the individual recipient's rights and is a vital component of the\nindividual's entitlement to services.\nII.

ER 10/253/18 [8/6/02 opinion at 18]. These numbers\ncontrast starkly with the substantial declines in the population of the DCs in the\npreceding 7 years. Ibid. In addition, as the Court also notes, the record before her\ndemonstrates that there are a number of developmentally disabled individuals\nwhose Individual Placement Plans and/or judicially ordered annual reviews show\nthey are recommended for discharge fi'om the DC, but cannot be discharged solely\nbecause of the lack of an appropriate community placements. ER 10/253/21-23.\n[8/6/02 opinion at 21-23]. Moreover, as noted below, there were over 1,100\nresidents of DCs whom staff had recommended were candidates for community\nplacement under the right circumstances.\nDespite these findings, the Court's August 6, 2002 order grants Defendants'\n43\n\nmotion for summary judgment on Plaintiffs' claims under the provisions of Title II\nof the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act\n(RA). The Court's grant of summary judgment makes the following four improper\ndeterminations: (1) that Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate entitlement to class\nwide relief becauseof a failure to show more than \"isolated\" and \"sporadic\"\ninstances of developmentally disabled individuals who were ready for community-\nbasedservices but who arestill institutionalized; (2) that Plaintiffs failed to\ndemonstrate a causal link between low wages andbenefits for direct care workers\nin community service programs for the developmentally disabled and the low rate\nof deinstitutionalization; (3) that California has a\"comprehensive plan\" for\ndeinstitutionalization which meets the requirements of showing reasonable\nprogress; and (4) that the cost of the relief sought by Plaintiffs constitutes a\n\"fundamental alteration\" of California's Developmental Disabilities Program. As\ndiscussed in detail below, each of these determinations improperly resolves a\nfactual dispute and, accordingly, the Court's grant of summary judgment must be\nreversed.\nSummary judgment is only properly granted when there is an absence of\ngenuine and disputed issues of material fact viewing the evidence most favorably\nto the non-moving party. F.R.Cir. P. 56, Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317,\n44\n\n322-23 (1986); Eisenberg v. Ins. Co. of North America, 815 F.2d 1285, 1288-89\n(9_hCir. 1987). The Court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the\nparty against summary judgment it sought Matushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith\nRadio Corp, 465 U.S. 564, 587. Intel. Cop. v. Hartford Accident & Indemnity Co.,\n952 F.2d 1551, 1558 (9thCir. 1981). On appeal, the Court's review of the grant of\na motion for summary judgment is de novo as to whether there is a genuine issue\nfor trial. Messick v. Horizon Industries, Inc., 62 F.3d 1227, 1229 (9thCir. 1995);\nLight v. Social Security Administration, 119 F.3d 789, 791 (9_hCir. 1997).\nBm Federal Law Mandates California Deinstitutionalize Developmentally\nDisabled Except in Limited Circumstances\nTitle II of the ADA provides that:\n\"no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason\nof such disability, be excluded from participation in or\nbe denied the benefit of services, programs or activities\nof a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by\nany such entity.\"\n42 U.S.C. § 12132. The ADA largely mirrors Section 504 of the RA, which states\nas follows:\nNo otherwise qualified individual with a disability shall,\nsolely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded\nfrom the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be\nsubjected to discrimination under any program or activity\nreceiving Federal financial assistance...\n45\n\n29 U.S.C. § 794(a). The elements of a claim under the cited sections of ADA and\nSection 504 are essentially the same. Olmstead v. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581,590-592\n(1999).\nThe ADA and Section 504 both contain integration mandates which direct\nstates to \"administer services, programs and activities in the most integrated\nsetting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities\" C.F.R. §\n35.130(d). \"The most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified\nindividuals with disabilities\" is \"a setting that enables individuals with disabilities\nto interact with nondisabled persons to the fullest extent possible,\" 28 C.F.R. pt\n35, App. A, p. 450 (1998).\nAnother regulation provides:\n\"A public entity shall make reasonable modifications in\npolicies, practices, or procedures when the modifications\nare necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of\ndisability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that\nmaking the modifications would fundamentally alter the\nnature of the service, program, or activity.\"\n28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7) 1998.\nThis Court in Townsend v. Quasim, 328 F.3d 511,516-17 (9_ Cir. 2003)\nstated that in Olmstead \"the Supreme Court interpreted the failure to provide\nMedicaid services in a community-based setting as a form of discrimination on the\n46\n\nbasisof disability.\" Similarly, in Fisher v. Oklahoma Health Care Auth.., 335 F.3d\n1175 (10 _ Cir. 2003), the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit held a rule\nchange in the Oklahoma Medicaid Program setting different limits on prescription\ndrug coverage for individuals in their own homes and individuals in nursing\nhomes states a cause of action for violating the integration mandate of the ADA.\nThe Supreme Court recognized that:\ninstitutional placement of persons who can handle and\nbenefit from community settings perpetuates\nunwarranted assumptions that persons so isolated are\nincapable or unworthy of participating in community\nlife.\nand that:\nconfinement in an institution severely diminishes the\neveryday life activities of individuals, including family\nrelations, social contacts, work options, economic\nindependence, educational advancement, and cultural\nenrichment.\nId. at 600-01 (Citations omitted)\nThe Supreme Court went on to hold that the ADA anti-institutionalization\nmandate applies to individuals who do not oppose community placement and who\nare qualified for community placement based on the \"reasonable assessment of the\nState's own professionals\", Id. at 602. Ibid.\nGrappling with the meaning of the required \"reasonable modification\" and\n47\n\nwith the limited defense that such change would cause a \"fundamental alteration\"\nin 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7) 1998 (cited above) the Supreme Court in Olmstead\nconcluded, among other things that:\nIf, for example, the State were to demonstrate that it had\na comprehensive, effectively working plan for placing\nqualified persons with mental disabilities in less\nrestrictive settings, and a waiting list that moved at a\nreasonable pace not controlled by the State's endeavors\nto keep its institutions fully populated, the reasonable-\nmodifications standard would be met.\n527 U.S. at 605-06.\nIf the state does not demonstrate that it has such a \"comprehensive plan\"\nplaintiffs will prevail unless the state can demonstrate that provision of the\ncommunity based services will \"fundamentally alter\" the nature of the services.\nOlmstead., _ 527 U.S. at 603-06; Townsend, _ 328 F.3d at 517-518.\nC. Plaintiffs Raised a Material Issue of Fact That There Were Sufficient\nNumbers of Developmentally Disabled Persons Unjustifiably\nInstitutionalized to Warrant Class Wide Relief\nAlthough the Court below accepted that Plaintiffs had raised a material\nissue of disputed fact concerning whether California is unnecessarily\ninstitutionalizing certain individuals with developmental disabilities, ER\n10/253/40 [8/6/02 opinion at 40], it then asserted that Plaintiffs failed to show\nenough instances of unjustified institutionalization to warrant class wide relief.\n48\n\nER 10/253/46 [8/6/02 opinion at 46]. Upon a motion for summary judgment and,\nin view of the record before the Court below, this determination is clearly in error.\nThe evidence already discussed establishes the slow down since 1998 in\ndeinstitutionalization, with more persons admitted to the Developmental Centers\nthan discharged. The Court found that many IPPs submitted to the court and\nnumerous In re Hop orders demonstrated persons remain in institutions solely\nbecause no appropriate community placement is available. ER 10/253/21-25;\n5/176/1-211; 3/170/I-177 [8/6/02 opinion at 21-25; Exhibits P56a, 56b, 61c, 63a,\n63c-63i, 65b, 65c, 66e-66i, 67c]. Most importantly, the Court failed to consider\nthe 1125 persons \"recommended for placement\" by Defendants' own staff. 7 The\nattempt by Defendants through the Declaration of Julia Jackson ER 6/183/7-8 to\nclaim this is not a list of persons \"ready\" to be placed in the community, which\nmay mean only that a placement has not been identified, only raises a factual\nquestion to be resolved at trial. Clearly Plaintiffs have established a substantial\nissue that persons are not being provided services in the community.\n7See ER 7/215/1-3 [Declaration of Larisa Cummings of May 8, 2002 authenticating and\nattaching as Exhibit 1 to Plaintiffs Reply to Defendants' Opposition to Summary Judgment and\nPlaintiffs' Opposition to Defendants' Cross Motion (hereinafter \"Plaintiffs' Reply\") a document\nproduced by Defendants in discovery entitled \"Developmental Center Residents That Have Been\nRecommended for Placement as of May, 2001 which contains approximately 1125 entries [ER\n7/215/4-56]. This is not the list in Exhibit P-123 to Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment\nwhich the Court excluded from evidence because of the failure to authenticate or explain it.\n49\n\nThe opinion of the Court below reiterates Defendants' points that, during\nthe last decade, the number of individuals with disabilities receiving community\nservices, has increased ER 10/253/19 [8/16/02 opinion p. 19], the total\nexpenditures for these services has increased. ER 10/253/20 [8/6/02 opinion p.20],\nsome plaintiff organizations programs have grown ER 10/253/21 [8/6/02 opinion\np. 21], and the number of vendors of community services has increased. ER\n10/253/20 [8/6/02 opinion p. 20]. That record, however, is just not relevant to the\nissue of whether there is an unmet need for community services in order to satisfy\nthe ADA and Section 504 mandates.\nD. Plaintiffs Raised a Material Issue of Fact Concerning the Causal Link\nBetween the Level of Compensation for Community Service Workers\nand the Failure to Deinstitutionalize\nSecondly, after agreeing that Plaintiffs had raised a material issue of\ndisputed fact concerning whether California is unjustifiably institutionalizing\ncertain individuals with developmental disabilities. ER 10/253/40. [8/6/02 opinion\nat 40], the Court proceeds to conclude that Plaintiffs have failed to place evidence\nin the record allowing the inference of a causal connection between an increase in\nthe wages and benefits of direct care workers in community services and\nincreasing the availability of quality community service workers who are essential\nto moving out of the DCs and preventing admission to the DCs of individuals with\n50\n\nparticularly special and complex needs. ER 10/253/40-4118/6/02 opinion 40-41].\nThis determination is clearly inconsistent with the evidence in the record. As the\nCourt itself notes,\n\"one RC Executive Director opined that the\nunavailability of community-based services was not due\nto the complex needs and specialized services required\nfor those individuals, but because the payments for\ncommunity services, including the component to pay for\nwages and benefits for direct services professionals are\ninsufficient to secure stable services of quality. Pls. Ex.\nP-56(a)\"\nER 10/253/39-40; 5/176/3-5 [8/6/02 opinion pp. 39-40; Plaintiffs Exhibit 56 (a)].\nIn addition, the testimony of one of Plaintiffs' own directors was that his\norganization simply can't continue to accept placement from the Developmental\nCenters of any more consumers with complex needs because it can't hire enough\nqualified personnel at the wages available to provide the quality services required.\nER 8/217/16-27 [P.Ex.B.p 111-122]. _\nDefendants own actions, furthermore, are particularly powerful proof of the\ncausal connection: in order to make new community placements Defendants have\ndrastically increased rates for direct care compensation. In fiscal year 2001-2002,\nin their Community Placement Plan (CPP), Defendants claim they have been\ndoing something different. ER 6/I 83/1-49 [Jackson Declaration]. They call this\n51\n\nnew process \"person centered\" planning, ER 6/178/18 [Defendants Cross-Motion\nfor Summary Judgment and Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary\nJudgment (hereinafter referred to as \"Defs' Opp\") at 10], and describe it as\nincluding, identifying and obtaining the extra services necessary to prevent\nadmissions, and committing additional staffing and funding to effectuate\ndeflection, and to stabilize community placements, ER 6/178/20 [Defs. Opp. at\n12], placing \"persons whose medical conditions and/or behavioral conditions\nmake community placement very difficult,\"... \"despite these barriers\" ER\n6/178/26 [Defs. Opp. at 18]. What Defendants have done that is truly new, and, by\ntheir own statements, necessary and effective, is to assure both quality and\navailability of community services ER 6/183/15-16 [Jackson Decl. ¶ 41,46]\nauthorizing rates which average twice the usual community_ service rates and,\nconcomitantly, support twice the direct care wages and benefits. ER 7/213/4;\n8/238/4; 6/183/2-4; 7/187/15 [Clark Decl.¶ 11; Shorter Decl. ¶ 8; Jackson Decl. ¶\n2, 4, 5; Carleton Declaration ¶ 44]. It is, therefore, clearly inferable from\nDefendants' own design and description of this new CPP that there is a causal\nrelationship between the level of community based direct care workers' wages and\nbenefits and successful implementation of the process of reducing the\ninstitutionalized population of developmentally disabled.\n52\n\nThe Court ignored this evidence of higher wages as necessary to place\nadditional disabled persons in the community and accepted Defendants' claim that\nthe new CPP Plan, ER 10/253/25; 6/183/1-49 [8/6/02 opinion p.24 and Budget\nChange Proposal there cited; Jackson Decl.] and higher payments arise because of\nthe particularly difficult and complex needs of those remaining in the institutions.\nBut for the ADA and 504 claims, this defense is a non-sequitur as far as causation\nis concerned. If it takes more funds because people are more \"difficult\" to place in\nthe community, then do it. The complaint is that Defendants have not done it\nenough to \"clear\" the demand.\nThe Court's statement \"If anything, it appears that the complex medical and\nbehavioral issues of those that continue to reside in institutions, after more than a\ndecade of deinstituionalization, may be the primary reason for their continued\ninstitutionalization\" ER 10/253/41[ Op. at 41 ] is a matter of deep factual dispute.\nSince Defendants have placed additional persons that it describes as complex and\ndifficult with increased rates, this argument fails to establish that such rates aren't\nnecessary, even if other conditions also must be met. But more importantly, there\nis ample evidence that the community is able and indeed deeply experienced in\nproviding services to individuals with these very same difficult needs.\nDefendants describe the consumers to whom the new CPP program is\n53\n\naddressedasbeing self-injurious, assaultive, anti-social and/or requiring skilled\nmedical intervention. ER 6/183/4-6; 7/187/14; 6/186/4-6 [Jackson Decl. ¶ 7-12;\nCarleton Dec. ¶ 41; Moise Decl. ¶¶ 10-15]. But, there is ample precedent for\nproviding developmental services to suchpeople in the community and\nDefendants' own statements show this. DDS publishes from its information\nsystemsa report entitled \"Major Characteristics of Clients in Developmental\nCenters Compared to Clients in the Community.\" The report dated October 7,\n1999, ER 2/169/2-15 [P. Exh. P-51], discloses that while 1,563 and 1,910people\nin the DCs respectively have retardation and cerebral palsy, 27,484 and 29,363\npeople who are clients in the community do, respectively. While 540 in DCs have\nautism, 11,346 in the community do. While 540 people in DCs have severelevels\nof retardation, 13,176 people in the community do. While 2,403 DC residents are\nsaidto have profound levels of retardation, 8,931 community clients do. While 1,\n554 people in DCs have severebehavior problems, 12,270 community clients do.\nWhile 1,592 people in the DCs arenot ambulatory without mobility device\nassistance,27, 438 community clients arenot. While 803 in DCs do not\nunderstand spoken words, 5,506 in community do not. While 1,496 in the DCs are\nfrequently violent, 14,500 community clients are. While 1619residents in DCs\nareself-injurious, 1,971 have unacceptable social behavior, and 1,402 will run\n54\n\naway, among community clients, 17,561 are self-injurious, 27,745 have\nunacceptable social behavior and 21,021 will run away. The statements in\nDefendants' report certainly cast serious doubt on Court's suggestion that the\nseverity of the problems in the residents of the DCs explain the recent slow pace\nof providing community services for persons in institutions.\nE. Plaintiffs Raised a Material Issue of Fact That California Has No\nComprehensive Plan or Waiting List for Deinstitutionalization\nThird, despite the acknowledged, dramatic slowing in the pace of the\ndeinstitutionalization process, noted above, the Court below concluded ER\n10/253/45. [8/6/02 opinion at 45] that the:\n\"Defendants have shown that they have just such a plan\n[as called for by Olmstead] in place, and that it is\noperating at a reasonable pace...\"\nIn support of this conclusion, the Court cites the Defendants' evidence of\nvarious proposals and plans adopted only in the year before filing of the motions\nfor summary judgment to spend considerable sums to deinstitutionalize or deflect\nfrom institutions a very limited number of individuals. ER 6/183/1-49 [Jackson\nDeclaration].\nThis finding of the Court misconstrues what Olmstead requires for an\nacceptable \"comprehensive plan\" and is clearly factually erroneous. The Court\n55\n\nutterly ignores the fact that California did not have anddid not even explicitly\nclaim it has\"a comprehensive plan\" or a \"waiting list\" sothat the Court below\nactually could apply the above quoted test from Olmstead. As late asApril 25,\n2002 (which was subsequent to the filing of Defendants' Motions for Summary\nJudgment), Defendants were just directing their staff\"to draft a description of the\nprocessby which California will produce an Olmstead plan.\" ER 8/218/1-5\n[Declaration of Deborah Doctor]. Indeed Defendants in the Declaration relied\nupon by the Court make no claim to having an \"Olmstead Plan\" and go out of their\nway to deny that there is anything the Court or parties could argue is a \"waiting\nlist\" by denying that the database containing the list of DC residents\n\"recommended for community placement in their individual placement programs\"\ncan be relied on as persons \"ready\" to be moved. ER 6/183/7-8. [Jackson\nDeclaration, ¶ 17]. Interestingly, no definition of\"ready\" to be placed is provided.\n(It may mean only that no placement has been identified or the state has not\nundertaken other necessary steps that it controls. In either case it still would be a\n\"waiting\" list.) The requirement of Olmstead that to meet the reasonable\nmodification test, the state must have a comprehensive plan means more than that\nthe state describe its past progress and generalized testimony about what the state\nis doing; it requires \"a plan which is communicated in some manner\" and in which\n56\n\nthe state\"has given assurance that there will be\" ongoing progress toward\ndeinstitutionization, Frederick L. v. Dept. of Public Welfare, 2004 U.S. App. Lexis\n7151 (3_ Cir. 2004) at 10. This California and Defendants have not done.\nIndeed, Olmstead requires that a state show that it has a waiting list that\nmoves at a reasonable pace. The CCP plans are simply a listing of persons the\nregional centers may move in the next two years. ER 6/183/2-3 [Jackson Decl. ¶¶\n4-5.] Defendants never quite exactly say how many people will be moved from\nthe DCs to community services during the two year period of this new CPP\nprocess, but it is clear that the process is strictly limited. Thus, Defendants say\nthat the \"current CCP... [serves] 183 consumers. ER 6/183/8-10 [Jackson\nDeclaration ¶¶ 20, 24]. If only 183 consumers were deinstitutionalized over a 2\nyear period, it would take over 12 years to deinstitutionalize the 1125 individuals\nin DCs who Defendants' recommended for community placement. But in fact the\npace will be even slower, for the CCP process also covers individuals \"whose\nunstable community living arrangements have resulted in referral to the RRDP\"\nER 6/183/2-3 [Jackson Decl. ¶ 4] which means an unknown number of persons\nwho are being deflected from going into the institution are included in those 183\nconsumers, thus reducing the number coming out of the Developmental Centers.\nThis can not be deemed as a matter of law as a satisfactory pace.\n57\n\nF. Plaintiffs Raised a Material Issue of Fact That There Are Untapped\nFederal Funds Available to Pay for Community Services Which the\nCourt Ignored in Considering the Defense of Fundamental Alteration\nFinally, the Court held that the relief sought under the ADA and Section\n504 claims-to raise direct care wages sufficiently to be able to provide the\ncapacity in the community to provide a community placement for those who are\ncapable of receiving services in a non segregated non-institutional environment\n-would constitute a fundamental alteration in the program because its cost would\nbe a \"drastic re-allocation,\" diverting funds from other programs and services. ER\n10/253/44 [8/6/02 opinion at 44]. This conclusion was premised on the cost being\n$1.4 billion increase to a $2.2 billion State budget for all services to the\ndevelopmentally disabled.\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Court appears to have looked at the\npotential cost for doubling wages of all direct care workers-for persons already\nreceiving services in the community as well as for the far fewer either in the\nDevelopment Centers who were prevented from receiving community services by\nthe insufficient payment rates and those new admissions to the DCs who fail to be\ndeflected into community services because of the payment rates available. Neither\nPlaintiffs nor Defendants made any calculation of the cost of increases necessary\nsolely to satisfy the ADA and Section 504 claims of unnecessary\n58\n\ninstitutionalization, even though expenditure of funds to increase wages in\nexisting community facilities to comply with the Medicaid Act are not to be\nincluded in the cost of complying With the Olmstead mandate. (The burden of\nshowing that the relief would constitute a fundamental alteration is upon the\nDefendants. Townsend v. Quasim, su_gl_, 328 F.3d at 518; see 28 C.F.R.\n35.150(a)(3)). For this reason alone, the Court below's conclusion concerning the\n\"fundamental alternation\" defense was in error.\nBut even if the Court below had not incorrectly commingled the dollars\nrequired for fulfilling the Olmstead mandate and the Medicaid mandate, in making\na determination of fact about the amount of untapped federal dollars available for\nraising' wages and benefits for direct care workers in community programs, the\nCourt ignored the inferences which must be drawn from Plaintiffs' evidence.\nPlaintiffs asserted to the Court that whatever the figure of increased expenditures\nfor compliance with the combined ADA and Medicaid claims, it was not a\nfundamental alteration to the program due to its costs because some or all of the\namounts needed could come from federal dollars currently not collected from\nCMS. See Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment, pp. 47-50. ER 1/162/52-55;\nPlaintiffs' Reply to Defendants' opposition to Summary Judgment and Plaintiffs'\nOpposition to Defendants\" Cross-Motion pp. 16-18. ER 7/211/20-22. The\n59\n\nPlaintiffs' experts opined there was at least $1.2 billion of unmatched federal\ndollars available to the state ER 7/214/2-3; 2/166/3-32 [Lakin Decl. ¶5 and P.Ex.\nA Braddock and Lakin Declaration] which Defendants' expert at first revised to\n$790.2 million ER 6/184/3-4 [Marquez Decl. ¶9] and then asserted was no higher\nthan $115 million. Ibid. The Court improperly resolved this dispute by simply\ndismissing Plaintiffs' evidence with the cryptic statement that \"There is no basis\nfor Plaintiffs' estimate which does not take into account state expenditures that do\nnot qualify for federal matching funds.\" ER 10/253/44 [8/6/02 opinion at 44\nn. 17]. Plaintiffs' declarations show, however, that nationally only 17 percent of\nMedicaid MR/DD expenditures do not qualify and in California 40 percent\ncurrently are unmatched, and that in particular, for residential services for the\ndevelopmentally disabled, the California unmatched expenditures are more than\ntwice the national average. ER 2/1656/27-8. Plaintiffs' declarations thus provide a\nbasis for inferring the availability of substantial additional amounts, and the Court\nimproperly resolved this dispute by accepting Defendants' contention. Moreover,\nthe evidence submitted in connection with the cost of the Medicaid claim\nconclusively confirmed that it was the Marquez Declaration which had no basis.\nAlthough Paragraph 6 of Marquez's April 18, 2002 Declaration stated that $115\nmillion was the total increase in annual federal reimbursement that would be\n6o\n\navailable by 2007-08, by 2003-04 the statebudget already included a$285 million\nincrease. ER 10/314/54 [Marquez Deposition at72]. Ms. Marquez benignly\ndescribe her earlier declaration as\"outdated.\" Ibid. Shealso admitted that her\ncalculation that the \"unmatched general expenditures for DDS programs was\n$790.2 million for fiscal year 1999-2000\" in Paragraph 9 of her declaration did not\ninclude an additional $721 million in unmatched expenditures by the departments\nof Health Services, Social Services and Rehabilitation even though expenditures\nmadeby other departments can bedrawn upon for Federal Financial Participation\nunder the HCBS program. ER 10/314/67-70, [Marquez Deposition at 98-99, 101-\n102].\nG. Conclusion\nBy federal statute, Justice Department regulations, U.S. Supreme Court\ndecisions and the decision of this Court there has developed a strong and clear\ncommitment to the proposition that developmentally disabled citizens are entitled\nto live in the least restricted and most integrated setting which reasonably can be\nprovided by the state. California's own Lanterman Act also articulates this same\npolicy Ass'n for Retarded Citizens v. Dept. of Developmental Services, 211 Cal.\nRptr. 758, 759 (1985). Fulfilling this commitment in the face of serious\nchallenges, both financial and otherwise, is not easy or simple, and the evolving\n61\n\n\"reasonable modification\" and \"fundamental alteration\" standards reflect at once\nthe complexity of the adjustments which must be made aswell as the strength of\nthe law's commitment to integration. The evidentiary record before the Court on\nPlaintiffs' ADA and Section 504 claims was significant in volume and complexity.\nThe Court's grant of Defendants' motions for summary judgment of those claims\nstubs its toe on this factual complexity. Careful examination shows that, contrary\nto the Court's determinations, there areat least material issues of fact in the record\nwith respect to eachof the four major determinations that the court made in order\nto grant Defendants' motions for summaryjudgment. The Court's grant of\nDefendants' motions for summary judgment should, therefore, be reversed by this\ncourt.\n62\n\nCONCLUSION\nFor all the reasons stated above, Plaintiffs request the Court to reverse and\nremand with direction to enter judgment in favor of Plaintiffs (1) denying\nDefendants' Motion for Reconsideration of the Courts' Decision granting\nDefendants' Motion for Judgment on the pleadings with respect to the\nenforceability of 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A) under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and (2)\ndenying Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment on Plaintiffs' claims under\nTitle II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.\nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED,\nPUBLIC INTEREST LAW CENTER\nOF PHILADELPHIA a,\nBy: _r._¢,14L_ ._z._'tCz_,?\n_ichael Churchill \"\nThomas K.

Gilhool, The Public Interest Law Center of Philadelphia, \nPhiladelphia, PA, argued the cause for the appellants. Michael Churchill, Judith A. Gran, \nand James Eiseman, Jr., of The Public Interest Law Center of Philadelphia, and Arlene \nMayerson and Larisa M. Cummings, of the Disability Rights Education & Defense Fund, \nBerkeley, CA, were on the briefs. \nSusan M. Carson, Deputy Attorney General, State of California, argued the cause for the \nappellee. Bill Lockyer, Attorney General, Teresa Stinson, Supervising Deputy Attorney \nGeneral, and Elizabeth Edwards, Deputy Attorney General, State of California, and Henry \nS. Hewitt, Todd Boley, and Clarisa R. Canady, of Erickson, Beasley, Hewitt & Wilson LLP, \nOakland, CA, were on the briefs. \n\nBefore: O'SCANNLAIN, COWEN,[*] and BEA, Circuit Judges. \nO'SCANNLAIN, Circuit Judge: \nWe must decide whether developmentally disabled recipients of Medicaid funds and their \nservice providers have a private right of action against state officials to compel the \nenforcement of a federal law governing state disbursement of such funds. We are also \nasked to decide, separately, whether the State of California has unlawfully discriminated by \nallegedly paying community-based service providers lower wages and benefits than it pays \nemployees in state institutions. \nI \nIn May, 2000, seven named plaintiffs representing a class of developmentally disabled \nindividuals, and six organizations that advocate for, or provide community-based services \nto, the developmentally disabled, brought this action against California officials who manage \nand administer various state programs for the developmentally disabled. \nThe class (collectively referred to by reference to the first named plaintiff as \"Sanchez\") \nconsists of those individuals who would be capable of living in the community with properly \nfunded support services but who now live in, or are at risk1054*1054 of living in, state \ninstitutions because community-based services are inadequately funded. All members of \nthe class are entitled to services under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § \n1396 et seq. (the \"Medicaid Act\"), and are \"qualified individual[s] with a disability\" under § \n504 of the Rehabilitation Act (\"§ 504\"), 29 U.S.C. § 794(a), and under Title II of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134 (the \"ADA\"). \nThe organizational plaintiffs (the \"Providers\") are not part of the class, but receive \nreimbursement from the State of California under the Medicaid Act for providing services to \nthe developmentally disabled. \nThe state officials are, respectively, officials of California's Department of Health and \nHuman Services, Department of Health Services, Department of Developmental Services \n(\"DDS\") and Department of Finance. These departments administer and oversee services \nfunded, in part, through the Medicaid Act. Generally, the Department of Health and Human \nServices ensures that the services of the other departments are provided in compliance with \nstate and federal law; the Department of Health Services directs, organizes and administers \nCalifornia's medical assistance programs, including Medi-Cal, California's Medicaid \nprogram; DDS directs, organizes and administers California's developmental disabilities \n\nservices program; and the Department of Finance oversees all of the State's financial and \nbusiness policies, including health care funding. \nA \nUnder the Medicaid Act, the federal government distributes funds to participating states to \nhelp them provide health care services for the poor and needy. Because California accepts \nMedicaid funds, it must administer its state Medicaid program, Medi-Cal, in compliance with \na state plan that has been pre-approved by the U.S. Department of Health and Human \nServices. The Medicaid Act sets out the requirements for a state plan at 42 U.S.C. § \n1396a(a)(1)-(65). \nIn 1981, in response to the fact that a disproportionate percentage of Medicaid resources \nwere being used for long-term institutional care and studies showing that many persons \nresiding in Medicaid-funded institutions would be capable of living at home or in the \ncommunity if additional support services were available, Congress authorized the Home \nand Community Based Services (\"HCBS\") waiver program. The HCBS program allows a \nvariety of noninstitutional care options for persons who would otherwise be eligible for \nMedicaid benefits in an institution, but who would prefer to live at home or in the \ncommunity.[1] To obtain a HCBS waiver for a qualified person, the State must certify that the \ncost of placing that individual through the waiver program will be less than or equal to the \ncost of his care in an institution. See generally Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 601-02, 119 \nS.Ct. 2176, 144 L.Ed.2d 540 (1999). \n1055*1055 B \nSanchez and the Providers claim that, because California pays wages to community-based \nservice providers participating in the HCBS waiver program at a lower rate than it pays \nemployees in state institutions, the State is in violation of the provision of the Medicaid Act \nthat requires that \nA State plan for medical assistance — [must] provide such methods and procedures \nrelating to the utilization of, and the payment for, care and services available under the plan \n... as may be necessary to ... assure that payments are consistent with efficiency, economy, \nand quality of care and are sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services \nare available under the plan at least to the extent that such care and services are available \nto the general population in the geographic area[.] \n\n42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A) (\"§ 30(A)\"). They further claim that the lower pay in \ncommunity-based programs has resulted in some developmentally disabled persons \nremaining unnecessarily institutionalized, which, they allege, constitutes discrimination \nagainst them in violation of the ADA and § 504. Sanchez and the Providers seek injunctive \nrelief requiring the state officials to increase wages and benefits for community-based \nservice providers to match substantially the wages and benefits of employees in state \ninstitutions. \nC \nThe state officials moved for judgment on the pleadings with respect to the § 30(A) claim, \non the ground that § 30(A) does not provide a private right of action enforceable under 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983 (\"§ 1983\"), and for summary judgment with respect to the ADA and § 504 \nclaims, on the ground that Sanchez and the Providers failed to establish sufficient facts \nestablish a prima facie case for discrimination. \nThe district court initially granted the state officials' summary judgment motion, but denied \nthe motion for judgment on the pleadings with respect to the § 30(A) claim. The state \nofficials subsequently filed a motion for reconsideration of the § 30(A) claim in light of the \nSupreme Court's intervening decision in Gonzaga v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 122 S.Ct. 2268, \n153 L.Ed.2d 309 (2002), which clarified the standard for evaluating whether a statute \ncreates a private right of action.[2] The district court granted the motion and, by opinion and \norder dated January 5, 2004, reversed its earlier decision. Applying the Supreme Court's \nguidance in Gonzaga, the district court concluded that neither Sanchez nor the Providers \ncould bring suit under § 1983 for a violation of § 30(A). \nSanchez and the Providers timely appeal from the district court's adverse decisions with \nrespect to both their § 30(A) and their ADA and § 504 claims. \nII \nBoth Sanchez and the Providers claim that § 30(A) creates an individual right enforceable \nby them under § 1983. Their 1056*1056 interests, however, though similar, are not \ncongruent. Sanchez's claim requires us to decide whether § 30(A) creates a private right of \naction for recipients of Medicaid funding; the Providers' claim requires us to decide the \nsame question with respect to providers of Medicaid services. Both claims require us to \nconsider the current state of the Supreme Court's private right of action and § 1983 \njurisprudence. \n\nA \nIn Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 100 S.Ct. 2502, 65 L.Ed.2d 555 (1980), the Supreme \nCourt held for the first time that § 1983 permits suits against state officials to enforce \nstatutes enacted pursuant to Congress's spending power. Id. at 4-5, 100 S.Ct. 2502. The \nscope of these new remedies available under § 1983 was clarified inPennhurst State \nSchool and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 101 S.Ct. 1531, 67 L.Ed.2d 694 (1981), in \nwhich the Court explained that Thiboutot did not alter the fact that \"the typical remedy for \nstate noncompliance with federally imposed conditions is not a private cause of action for \nnoncompliance but rather action by the Federal Government to terminate funds to the \nState.\" Id. at 28, 100 S.Ct. 2502. Pennhurstestablished that the remedy announced \nin Thiboutot was to be applied sparingly and only to statutes in which Congress \"speak[s] \nwith a clear voice,\" and \"unambiguously\" creates a \"right[] secured by the laws of the United \nStates.\" Id. at 17, 28, 100 S.Ct. 2502 (quotation marks omitted). The Court also advised that \nthe identification of a substantive right embodied in a statute was only the first of at least \ntwo steps that must be considered when analyzing whether that right is enforceable under § \n1983. Id. at 28 n. 21, 100 S.Ct. 2502 (\"Because we conclude that § 6010 confers no \nsubstantive rights, we need not reach the question whether there is a private cause of \naction under that section or under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to enforce those rights.\") (emphasis \nadded). \nTen years later, in Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Ass'n, 496 U.S. 498, 110 S.Ct. 2510, 110 \nL.Ed.2d 455 (1990), the Court held that 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(13)(A) (subsequently \nrepealed) of the Medicaid Act could give rise to a private right of action under § 1983. Id. at \n523, 110 S.Ct. 2510. This anomalous decision appeared to mark a sudden expansion in the \nCourt's § 1983 jurisprudence. In hindsight, however, it was merely a rare case in which, as \nthe Court explained in Gonzaga, a statute \"explicitly conferred specific monetary \nentitlements upon the plaintiffs ... [and] Congress left no doubt of its intent for private \nenforcement ....\" Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 280, 122 S.Ct. 2268.[3] \nIn Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329, 117 S.Ct. 1353, 137 L.Ed.2d 569 (1997), the Court \nfinally provided an analytical framework for courts to use when evaluating whether or not a \nstatute creates a right enforceable under § 1983. Blessing requires a court to consider three \nfactors: (1) \"Congress must have intended that the provision in question benefit the \nplaintiff,\" id. at 340, 117 S.Ct. 1353; (2) \"the plaintiff must demonstrate that the right \nassertedly protected by the statute is not so `vague and amorphous' that its enforcement \nwould strain judicial competence,\" id.; and (3) \"the statute must unambiguously impose \na 1057*1057 binding obligation on the States. In other words, the provision giving rise to the \n\nasserted right must be couched in mandatory rather than precatory terms.\" Id. at 341, 117 \nS.Ct. 1353. Somewhat confusingly, the first Blessing factor addressed whether or not the \nplaintiff receives an intended \"benefit\" from the statute, whereas the second factor referred \nnot to a \"benefit\" but to a \"right.\" In Gonzaga, the Court resolved this inconsistency. \nThe Court first acknowledged that \"[s]ome language in our opinions might be read to \nsuggest that something less than an unambiguously conferred right is enforceable by § \n1983.\" Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 282, 122 S.Ct. 2268 (referring specifically to theBlessing test). \nCorrecting this misperception, the Court announced that \n[w]e now reject the notion that our cases permit anything short of an unambiguously \nconferred right to support a cause of action brought under § 1983. Section 1983 provides a \nremedy only for the deprivation of \"rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the \nConstitution and laws\" of the United States. Accordingly, it is rights, not the broader or \nvaguer \"benefits\" or \"interests,\" that may be enforced under the authority of that section. \nThis being so, we further reject the notion that our implied right of action cases are separate \nand distinct from our § 1983 cases. To the contrary, our implied right of action cases should \nguide the determination of whether a statute confers rights enforceable under § 1983. \nId. at 283, 122 S.Ct. 2268. The Court repeatedly stressed that it is Congress's use of \nexplicit, individually focused, rights-creating language that reveals congressional intent to \ncreate an individually enforceable right in a spending statute.[4] SeeGonzaga, 536 U.S. at \n283-84, 122 S.Ct. 2268 (\"[T]he question whether Congress intended to create a private right \nof action is definitively answered in the negative where a statute by its terms grants no \nprivate rights to any identifiable class.\") (quotation marks and alterations omitted, emphasis \nadded).[5] \n1058*1058 As examples of paradigmatic rights-creating language, the Court cited the texts \nof Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title IX of the Education Amendments of \n1972. Id. at 287, 122 S.Ct. 2268 (comparing the text of FERPA unfavorably to \"the \nindividually focused terminology of Titles VI and IX\"). Those statutes provide, respectively, \nthat \"No person in the United States shall ... be subjected to discrimination,\" 42 U.S.C. § \n2000d, and that \"No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex ... be subjected to \ndiscrimination.\" 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). Although our inquiry should not be limited to looking \nfor those precise phrases, statutory language less direct than the individually-focused \"No \nperson shall ...\" must be supported by other indicia so unambiguous that we are left without \nany doubt that Congress intended to create an individual, enforceable right remediable \nunder § 1983. \n\nB \nSince Gonzaga, no federal court of appeals of which we are aware has concluded that § \n30(A) provides Medicaid recipients or providers with a right enforceable under § 1983. \nBefore Gonzaga, the Fifth and Eighth Circuits each held that Medicaid recipients had such a \nprivate right of action. See Evergreen Presbyterian Ministries, Inc. v. Hood,235 F.3d 908, \n927-28 (5th Cir.2000); Ark. Med. Soc'y, Inc. v. Reynolds 6 F.3d 519, 528 (8th \nCir.1993); cf. Pa. Pharmacists Ass'n v. Houstoun, 283 F.3d 531, 543-44 (3rd Cir.2002) (en \nbanc) (positing, in dicta, a right for recipients while rejecting such a right for \nproviders); Visiting Nurse Ass'n v. Bullen, 93 F.3d 997, 1004 n. 7 (1st Cir.1996) (positing, in \ndicta, a right for recipients while holding that such a right existed for providers). The First, \nSeventh and Eighth Circuits held that such a right existed for Medicaid \nproviders. See Visiting Nurse Ass'n, 93 F.3d at 1005 (1st Cir.1996); Methodist Hosps. v. \nSullivan, 91 F.3d 1026, 1029 (7th Cir.1996); Ark. Med. Soc'y, Inc., 6 F.3d at 528. By \ncontrast, the Third and Fifth Circuits explicitly held that § 30(A) did not create a right \nenforceable by Medicaid providers. See Pa. Pharmacists Ass'n, 283 F.3d at 543; Evergreen \nPresbyterian Ministries, Inc., 235 F.3d at 929. \nHowever, in light of Gonzaga, the First Circuit has since reversed itself in a case involving \nonly the rights of providers. See 1059*1059 Long Term Care Pharm. Alliance v. \nFerguson, 362 F.3d 50, 59 (1st Cir.2004) (\"If Gonzaga had existed prior to Bullen, the panel \ncould not have come to the same result.... Providers such as pharmacies do not have a \nprivate right of action under subsection (30)(A).\"). With the First Circuit's example in mind, \nwe turn to the language of § 30(A) to determine if it unambiguously manifests \nCongressional intent to create individual rights, whether for Medicaid recipients or providers, \nremediable under § 1983. \nC \nIn contrast to the language of Title VI and Title IX, there is nothing in the text of § 30(A) that \nunmistakably focuses on recipients or providers as individuals. Moreover, the flexible, \nadministrative standards embodied in the statute do not reflect a Congressional intent to \nprovide a private remedy for their violation. \n1 \n\nIn Gonzaga, the Supreme Court instructed that, when a \"provision focuse[s] on `the \naggregate services provided by the State,' rather than `the needs of any particular person,' \nit confer[s] no individual rights and thus [cannot] be enforced by § 1983.\" Id.at 282, 122 \nS.Ct. 2268 (quoting Blessing, 520 U.S. at 340, 117 S.Ct. 1353). Like the statute under \nreview in Gonzaga, § 30(A) also has an aggregate focus, rather than an individual focus \nthat would be evidence of an intent to confer an individually enforceable right. The statute \nspeaks not of any individual's right but of the State's obligation to develop \"methods and \nprocedures\" for providing services generally. Indeed, the only reference in § 30(A) to \nrecipients of Medicaid services is in the aggregate, as members of \"the general population \nin the geographic area.\" A statutory provision that refers to the individual only in the context \nof describing the necessity of developing state-wide policies and procedures does not \nreflect a clear Congressional intent to create a private right of action. \nThe text does at least refer explicitly to Medicaid providers, but as a means to an \nadministrative end rather than as individual beneficiaries of the statute. The State is directed \nto \"provide methods and procedures ... sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and \nservices are available under the plan at least to the extent that such care and services are \navailable to the general population in the geographic area.\" Under § 30(A), providers are to \nbe \"enlisted\" as subordinate partners in the administration of Medicaid services. They may \ncertainly benefit from their relationship with the State, but they are, at best, indirect \nbeneficiaries and it would strain common sense to read § 30(A) as creating a \"right\" \nenforceable by them. See Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284, 122 S.Ct. 2268 (\"For a statute to \ncreate such private rights, its text must be phrased in terms of the persons benefitted.\"). \n2 \nFar from focusing on the rights of a specific class of beneficiaries, § 30(A) is concerned with \na number of competing interests. It requires a State to \"provide such methods and \nprocedures relating to ... care and services ... as may be necessary to ... assure that \npayments are consistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care.\" The most efficient \nand economical system of providing care may be one that benefits taxpayers to the \ndetriment of medical providers and recipients; likewise, the provision of \"quality\" care — \nwhatever standard may be implied by such a nebulous term — is likely to conflict with the \ngoals of efficiency and economy. The tension between these statutory objectives supports \nthe conclusion that § 30(A) is concerned with overall methodology rather 1060*1060 than \nconferring individually enforceable rights on individual Medicaid recipients. \n\nIn Gonzaga, Justice Breyer observed that the \"broad and nonspecific\" language of FERPA \nindicated that \"Congress may well have wanted ... to achieve the expertise, uniformity, \nwide-spread consultation, and resulting administrative guidance that can accompany \nagency decisionmaking and to avoid the comparative risk of inconsistent interpretations and \nmisincentives that can arise out of an occasional inappropriate application of the statute in a \nprivate action for damages.\" 536 U.S. at 292, 122 S.Ct. 2268 (Breyer, J., concurring in the \njudgment). The language of § 30(A) is similarly ill-suited to judicial remedy; the \ninterpretation and balancing of the statute's indeterminate and competing goals would \ninvolve making policy decisions for which this court has little expertise and even less \nauthority. \n3 \nThe text and structure of § 30(A) simply do not focus on an individual recipient's or \nprovider's right to benefits, nor is the \"broad and diffuse\" language of the statute amenable \nto judicial remedy. We conclude, therefore, that Congress has not spoken with an \nunambiguous, clear voice that would put a State on notice that Medicaid recipients or \nproviders are able to compel state action under § 1983. \nD \nThis conclusion follows our discussion of the impact of Gonzaga in Price v. City of \nStockton, 390 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir.2004). In that case, former tenants of low-income hotels \nand a nonprofit organization involved in assisting the homeless sued the City of Stockton, \nalleging that the closing of residential hotels for health and safety reasons violated federal \nand state laws, including the Housing and Community Development Act. We were asked to \ndecide whether the plaintiffs had a private right of action to enforce the relevant provisions \nof the act. \nWe began by observing that, after Gonzaga, \"to create enforceable rights [such as would \nsatisfy the first prong of the Blessing test] the language of the statute must focus on \nindividual entitlement to benefits rather than the aggregate or systemwide policies and \npractices of a regulated entity.\" Price, 390 F.3d at 1110. Applying this rule, we noted that \n\"[f]irst and foremost, Section 104(k) mandates that `each grantee shall provide for \nreasonable benefits to any person involuntarily and permanently displaced as a result of the \nuse of assistance received under this chapter to acquire or substantially rehabilitate \nproperty.'\" Id. (emphasis added). From this language, we concluded that the section \"is \n`phrased with an unmistakable focus on the benefited class' [and] does not speak `only in \n\nterms of institutional policy and practice,' ... but rather requires that benefits be provided to \nparticular persons displaced by federally funded redevelopment activities,\" and, therefore, it \n\"evinces a clear intent to create a federal right.\" Id. at 1111 (quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at \n288, 122 S.Ct. 2268) (citations omitted). \nWe also held that the \"`reasonable benefits' to which displaced persons unquestionably are \nentitled under Section 104(k),\" were not \"too vague for judicial enforcement.\" Id. Because \nrelated statutory provisions and regulations \"enumerate[d] the monetary benefits to which \ndisplaced persons of low and moderate income are entitled, `including reimbursement for \nactual and reasonable moving expenses, security deposits, credit checks, and other \nmoving-related expenses, including any interim living costs,'\" id. at 1112, we concluded that \nthe terms of the statute anticipated a clear, enforceable remedy for violations of the rights \nenumerated in the statute. Id. at 1112, 1114. \n1061*1061 In contrast, we held that \"other provisions of[the statute under consideration] do \nnot share Section 104(k)'s focus on individual benefits,\" id. at 1113, and, instead, \n\"aredirected to governmental agencies ... and are phrased in aggregate terms, without \nreference to individual displaced persons.\" Id. (emphasis added, quotation marks omitted). \nWe concluded that, \"[i]n consideration of this aggregate focus, we hold that the \nrequirements of [these other sections of the statute] do not ... create individual rights \ndirectly: ... the lack of `rights-creating' language and the absence of any focus on individual \nentitlements, would prevent us from holding that[they] create individual rights.\" Id. at 1113-\n14 (quotation marks and citation omitted). \nBecause § 30(A) also lacks \"rights-creating\" language and \"any focus on individual \nentitlements,\" and does not anticipate a judicially enforceable remedy, it shares the flaws \nthat Price identified as fatal to the sections of the Housing and Community Development Act \nthat we held to be unenforceable. \nE \nOur conclusion also accords with the First Circuit's analysis of the text of § 30(A) inLong \nTerm Care. Although that case was concerned only with Medicaid providers, its reasoning \napplies also to recipients. The First Circuit noted that § 30(A) \"has ... broad[ ] coverage, sets \nforth general objectives, and mentions no category of entity or person specially protected\" \nand \"has no `rights creating language' and identifies no discrete class of beneficiaries — \ntwo touchstones in Gonzaga's analysis and of those earlier cases on which Gonzaga chose \nto build.\" Long Term Care, 362 F.3d at 56-57 (citations omitted). Instead, \"[t]he provision \n\nfocuses ... upon the state as the person regulated rather than individuals protected, \nsuggesting no intent to confer rights on a particular class of persons.\" Id. (quotation marks \nand citation omitted). The court concluded that, \"[s]ubsection (30)(A) presents the same \nconcern\" that Justice Breyer identified in Gonzaga, namely that \"much of the statute's key \n[substantive] language is broad and non-specific,\" id. at 58 (quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at \n292, 122 S.Ct. 2268 (Breyer, J., concurring in the judgment)) (alteration in original), which \nsuggests \"that exclusive agency enforcement might fit the scheme better than a plethora of \nprivate actions threatening disparate outcomes.\" Id. \nWe do not believe the Third Circuit case, Sabree v. Richman, 367 F.3d 180 (3d \nCir.2004), which held that \"it [is] difficult, if not impossible, as a linguistic matter, to \ndistinguish the import of the relevant Title XIX language—`A State plan must provide'—from \nthe `No person shall' language of Titles VI and IX,\" id. at 190, to be applicable to our \nanalysis of § 30(A). Sabree involved two sections of the Medicaid Act that are prefaced by \nlanguage very different from that which introduces § 30(A). Those provisions specifically \nfocus on entitlements available to \"all eligibleindividuals\" and \"provide ... for making medical \nassistance available ... to allindividuals\" rather than on the \"methods and procedures\" by \nwhich a State can balance the often incompatible goals of \"efficiency, economy, and quality \nof care\" in the administration of Medicaid services. Compare 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(8) and \n(a)(10) (emphases added) with 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A). The Third Circuit observed \nthat the phrase \"A State plan must provide,\" when read together with the individual focus of \n42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(8) and (a)(10), has an overall direction that is similar to the \nindividually focused Title VI and IX language approved by the Court in Gonzaga.Such \nlanguage is also notably absent from § 30(A). \n1062*1062 Although 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a) sets out a comprehensive list of requirements \nthat a state plan must meet, it does not describe every requirement in the same language. \nSome requirements, such as those addressed in Sabree, focus on individual recipients, \nwhile others are concerned with the procedural administration of the Medicaid Act by the \nStates and only refer to recipients, if at all, in the aggregate. Section 30(A) is one of the \nlatter provisions; it is directly concerned with the State as administrator and only indirectly \nwith recipients and providers as beneficiaries of the administered services. Gonzaga made \nit clear that simply being the intended beneficiary of a statute is not enough to demonstrate \nthe intentional creation of an enforceable right. \nF \n\nAfter Gonzaga, there can be no doubt that, to satisfy the Blessing test, a plaintiff seeking \nredress under § 1983 must assert the violation of an individually enforceableright conferred \nspecifically upon him, not merely a violation of federal law or the denial of \na benefit or interest, no matter how unambiguously conferred. The text and structure of § \n30(A) do not persuade us that Congress has, with a clear voice, intended to create an \nindividual right that either Medicaid recipients or providers would be able to enforce under § \n1983. Because we hold that § 30(A) fails the first prong of the Blessing test, we do not need \nto consider the second and third prongs. \nIII \nSanchez and the Providers also appeal the district court's order granting the state officials' \nsummary judgment motion with respect to the ADA and § 504 claims. They allege that \nCalifornia has failed to pursue HCBS waiver reimbursements under Medicaid aggressively, \nwhich, they further allege, could be used to set payment rates to community-based service \nproviders at a level high enough to provide community-based care for all developmentally \ndisabled persons who desire it. They request an injunction compelling the state officials to \nincrease payments to community-based service providers to prevent what they characterize \nas the continuing, unnecessary segregation of developmentally disabled persons in \ninstitutions. \nA \nBoth the ADA and § 504 prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability in the \nadministration of a public program receiving Federal funding. Because of the nearly \nidentical language of 42 U.S.C. § 12132 and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act,[6] and because \nthe Sanchez appellants are \"qualified individual[s] with a disability\" within the meaning of \nboth statutes, for the purposes of this case we construe the two provisions as co-\nextensive. Cf. Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U.S. 181, 184-85, 122 S.Ct. 2097, 153 L.Ed.2d 230 \n(2002); Lovell v. Chandler, 303 F.3d 1039, 1052 (9th Cir. 2002); Helen L. v. DiDario, 46 \nF.3d 325, 331-32 (3d Cir.1995). \n1063*1063 Regulations enacted pursuant to the ADA and § 504 both express a clear policy \npreference in favor of integrating developmentally disabled persons into the community over \ninstitutional care: one § 504 regulation requires programs that receive federal funding to \n\"administer programs and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs \nof qualified handicapped persons,\" 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(d) (2005); and one of the ADA's Title \nII regulations requires a public entity to \"administer services, programs, and activities in the \n\nmost integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.\" 28 \nC.F.R. § 35.130(d) (2005). Again, for the purposes of this appeal, we interpret these \nprovisions as co-extensive. \nB \nIn granting the state officials' motion for summary judgment on Sanchez's and the \nProviders' ADA and § 504 claims, the district court held that, drawing all reasonable \ninferences in favor of Sanchez and the Providers, they had failed to establish any material \nfactual dispute with respect to three key issues, all of which were necessary elements of a \nprima facie case for discrimination. \nFirst, the court held that \"[e]ven if unjustified institutionalization is occurring, [Sanchez and \nthe Providers] have failed to show that an increase in wages and benefits for community-\nbased direct care workers would remedy the alleged violation.\" Second, the court held that \nthe relief proposed by Sanchez and the Providers is not a \"reasonable modification\" of \nCalifornia's current policies and practices because the $1.4 billion of extra expenditure they \nrequest would represent a forty percent increase in the State's budget for developmentally \ndisabled services. Third, the court held that California already has in place an acceptable \nplan for deinstitutionalization, the disruption of which would involve a fundamental alteration \nof the State's current policies and practices in contravention of the Supreme Court's \ninstructions inOlmstead. If we uphold any one of these conclusions, then the state officials \nmust prevail. \n1 \nIn Olmstead, the Supreme Court interpreted Title II of the ADA as forbidding the arbitrary \nsegregation of the disabled in large state institutions. \"Unjustified isolation,\" the Court held, \n\"is properly regarded as discrimination based on disability.\" 527 U.S. at 597, 119 S.Ct. \n2176. However, the Court \"recognize[d], as well, the States' need to maintain a range of \nfacilities for the care and treatment of persons with divers mental disabilities, and the States' \nobligation to administer services with an even hand.\" Id.Justice Ginsburg, writing for a \nplurality of the Court, elaborated on this balancing of integration with competing policy and \nfiscal considerations, emphasizing that \"[t]he State's responsibility, once it provides \ncommunity-based treatment to qualified persons with disabilities, is not boundless.\" Id. at \n603, 119 S.Ct. 2176. A State is only required to modify its current practices if the \nmodifications necessary to satisfy the request for increased deinstitutionalization are \nreasonable and do not fundamentally alter the nature of the State's services or \n\nprogram. Id.; 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7) (2005) (\"A public entity shall make reasonable \nmodifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to \navoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that \nmaking the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or \nactivity.\"). \nOne state defense under the ADA, which was explicitly approved by \nthe 1064*1064 Court,[7] is the existence of a state plan for deinstitutionalization (an \n\"Olmstead Plan\"). The Court held that, \n[i]f ... the State were to demonstrate that it had a comprehensive, effectively working plan \nfor placing qualified persons with mental disabilities in less restrictive settings, and a waiting \nlist that moved at a reasonable pace not controlled by the State's endeavors to keep its \ninstitutions fully populated, the reasonable-modifications standard would be met. \nId. at 605-06, 119 S.Ct. 2176. \nThe district court concluded that California is currently operating an acceptable \ndeinstitutionalization plan, which, under Olmstead, should not be set aside or modified by \nthe courts. \na \nUnder California law, all persons with developmental disabilities are entitled to free health \ncare services. The Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act, Cal. Welf. & \nInst.Code, §§ 4500-4846, (the \"Lanterman Act\") requires the State to provide \"[a]n array of \nservices and supports ... which is sufficiently complete to meet the needs and choices of \neach person with developmental disabilities, regardless of age or degree of disability, and at \neach stage of life and to support their integration into the mainstream life of the \ncommunity.\" Id. § 4501. As described by the California Supreme Court, \n[t]he purpose of the statutory scheme is twofold: to prevent or minimize the \ninstitutionalization of developmentally disabled persons and their dislocation from family and \ncommunity, and to enable them to approximate the pattern of everyday living of non-\ndisabled persons of the same age and to lead more independent and productive lives in the \ncommunity. \nAss'n for Retarded Citizens v. Dep't of Developmental Servs., 38 Cal.3d 384, 211 Cal.Rptr. \n758, 696 P.2d 150, 152 (1985) (\"ARC\") (citations omitted). The Lanterman Act gives DDS \n\n\"jurisdiction over the execution of the laws relating to the care, custody, and treatment of \ndevelopmentally disabled persons,\" Cal. Welf. & Inst.Code § 4416, but DDS's role \"is \nbasically limited to promoting the cost-effectiveness of the operations of [21 Regional \nCenters], and does not extend to the control of the manner in which they provide services or \nin general operate their programs.\" ARC, 211 Cal.Rptr. 758, 696 P.2d at 152. The \nLanterman Act also established 21 Regional Centers, independent, private non-profit \ncommunity agencies under contract with the DDS, which coordinate services to \"provide \neach developmentally disabled person with services that enable him to live ... in the \ncommunity.\" Id. \nThrough the Regional Centers, California provides care services for more than 180,000 \ndevelopmentally disabled persons. Of these, approximately 3,800 live in one of seven large, \ncongregate institutions called Developmental Centers, which are located throughout the \nState and are operated by DDS. Although they are operated by DDS, it is the Regional \nCenters that determine if a consumer needs to be institutionalized in a Developmental \nCenter and for how long. Regional Centers are required to develop an Individual Program \nPlan for each consumer. Once an individual plan is prepared, the responsible Regional \nCenter 1065*1065 must review it annually and modify it as necessary. An individual plan \nmust include an assessment of the consumer's capabilities and limitations, a statement of \ntime-limited objectives for improving his situation, a schedule of the type and amount of \nservices necessary to achieve these objectives, and a schedule of periodic review to ensure \nthat the services have been provided and the objectives met. \nThe ninety-eight percent of developmentally disabled persons who receive care in the \ncommunity do so either at Intermediate Care Facilities, which are licensed to provide 24-\nhour nursing care and are scattered throughout the State; Community Care Facilities, which \nprovide 24-hour, non-medical, community-based residential care for developmentally \ndisabled persons in need of personal services, and supervision or assistance essential for \nself-protection; or through a variety of non-residential day programs and residential support \nservices for developmentally disabled persons who live at home or in the community. It is \nthe Regional Centers that select and contract with these community based service \nproviders, which include Family Home Agencies, Foster Family Agencies, Independent \nLiving Programs, Supported Living Services, and other support programs, such as \nvocational training, transportation, health care, respite services, community integration \ntraining, community activities support, adaptive skills training, behavior management, tutors, \nspecial education, recreation therapy, counseling, infant development, and speech \npathology. \n\nCare of developmentally disabled persons in these community-based programs may be \neligible for Medicaid reimbursement pursuant to the HCBS waiver program. However, in \norder to qualify for Medicaid reimbursement, the recipient must be a low income person and \nthe services must also be provided at a lower cost than if they were provided in a state \ninstitution. For qualifying recipients using qualifying services, Medicaid provides matching \nfunds equal to approximately half of the cost of those services.[8] \nThe number of places in the HCBS waiver program is capped and a State must apply for \nany increases of the cap from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. \nBecause of this, States often apply for, and receive, preapproval for more places than they \ncurrently need. In 2002, California had more than 45,000 waiver places approved and \nreceived matching funds for approximately 35,000 registered persons. That cap has been \napproved to increase to approximately 70,000 by October, 2005. Because Sanchez and the \nProviders have only identified, at most, 1,125 allegedly unjustifiably institutionalized \npersons, there would be no reason for California to increase the number of places in its \nHCBS waiver program at this time and Sanchez and the Providers do not explicitly request \nsuch an increase. \nb \nIn the 1980s, the DDS and the Regional Centers developed a program of Regional \nResource Development Projects to enable the placement of more Developmental Center \nresidents in the community. The regional development projects assist the Regional Centers \nin identifying the services that Developmental Center residents need to live in the \ncommunity. The regional development projects maintain a database 1066*1066 that \nindicates whether a Developmental Center resident is recommended by his individual plan \n(either in the short-term or as a longer-term goal) to live in the community. \nThe DDS also utilizes a system of Community Placement Plans (\"CPPs\") to move \nDevelopmental Center residents to community residential settings. Community Placement \nPlans are individualized and reflect a partnership between the Regional Center, each \nindividual and his family, the Developmental Center, and the Regional Resource \nDevelopment Project. Because many recipients require specialized services that may be \ndifficult to locate in some areas of California, part of a Community Placement Plan often \ninvolves the Regional Center enhancing and developing the local resources needed to \nmove the consumer from a Developmental Center into the community. \n\nDespite the comprehensive and accommodating nature of California's deinstitutionalization \npractices, barriers to individual community placement remain. One common barrier is the \nopposition of an individual's family to community placement. Although a family cannot veto \na decision by the Regional Center to place a family member in the community, family \ninvolvement is often crucial in making a successful placement. Many current Developmental \nCenter residents also exhibit complex and difficult behaviors, including self-injurious or \naggressive behavior, that make community placement difficult, and many have serious and \nlife-threatening medical conditions requiring 24-hour nursing care. Therefore, for the \ndevelopmentally disabled that still reside in Developmental Centers, placement in the \ncommunity can be a very challenging process. \nDespite these obstacles, California successfully reduced the percentage of developmentally \ndisabled persons residing in Developmental Centers from six percent of the \ndevelopmentally disabled population to two percent over the last decade. This success is \ndue in part to the fact that the State's spending on community-based care increased \nsignificantly over that same period. The 2002/2003 CPP program allocated funding as high \nas $286,000 for the first year that a developmentally disabled person moves into the \ncommunity. After the first year, the budget provided for an average of $102,000 per person \nto maintain the community placement. That budget represented an increase in total CPP \nfunding of over sixty percent. Finally, and most significantly, § 4669.2 of the Lanterman Act \nauthorizes DDS to bypass other restrictions to fund proposals for special projects. This \nmeans that DDS is authorized to fund certain services, such as those provided under the \nlatest iteration of the CPP program, outside the existing rate structure. DDS has used this \nauthority to fund services that encourage deinstitutionalization at much higher rates than in \nthe recent past. \nSanchez and the Providers argue that, although California has achieved significant success \nmoving institutionalized persons into the community, in recent years the rate of community \nplacement has slowed. Sanchez and the Providers have shown that for the three years prior \nto the district court's decision, the number of admissions to Developmental Centers was \nactually greater than the number of discharges, although the overall residential population \ndeclined, in part due to the natural deaths of residents. However, the record supports the \ndistrict court's finding that this recent decline in the rate of community placements has been \ndue to the fact that those persons with the least severe disabilities or with the best \nprospects for integration into the community were deinstitutionalized first. Those who \nremain in Developmental Centers have, on average, more, and more severe, \ndisabilities 1067*1067and face higher barriers to deinstitutionalization, including family or \npersonal opposition. The 2% of developmentally disabled persons who still reside in \n\nDevelopmental Centers are more than four times more likely to have serious medical \nproblems, more than six times more likely to have severe behavior problems, and 69% of \ncurrent residents are among the top 10% of all persons with the most acute levels of \nretardation. In addition, since 1998, the number of persons admitted to Developmental \nCenters pursuant to court orders finding them incompetent to stand trial (so called \"forensic\" \nadmittances) has increased dramatically.[9] \n2 \nThe district court concluded that California's commitment to the deinstitutionalization of \nthose Developmental Center residents for whom community integration is desirable, \nachievable and unopposed, is genuine, comprehensive and reasonable. This conclusion \nwas based on evidence from the record, which showed that \"[o]verall, California's \nexpenditures for individuals in community settings increased 196% [between 1991 and \n2001], while caseload ... increased fifty-five percent in the same period,\" that California has \napplied for increased places under the HCBS waiver program, and that, \"[between 1996 \nand 2000], California reduced its institution population by twenty percent.\" DDS has also \nbudgeted to develop 42 new Community Care Facilities and ten new Intermediate Care \nFacilities, and anticipates a reduction in institutionalization that would allow it to close at \nleast one Developmental Center by 2007. We are satisfied, therefore, that the district court's \nconclusion that California's \"plan is comprehensive, effective, and moving at a reasonable \npace,\" is supported by the record. \n3 \nIn Olmstead, the Court recognized that a State must have sufficient leeway \"[t]o maintain a \nrange of facilities and to administer services with an even hand,\" 527 U.S. at 605, 119 S.Ct. \n2176, and that courts should be sympathetic to fundamental alteration defenses against \nproposed modifications to state services and programs for care of the disabled.[10] Id.; see \nalso Townsend, 328 F.3d at 520. \nConcomitant with this leeway is a recognition that, when there is evidence that a State has \nin place a comprehensive deinstitutionalization scheme, which, in light of existing budgetary \nconstraints and the competing demands of other services that the State provides, including \nthe maintenance of institutional care facilities, seeOlmstead, 527 U.S. at 597, 119 S.Ct. \n2176, 1068*1068 is \"effectively working,\" id. at 605, 119 S.Ct. 2176, the courts will not tinker \nwith that scheme. Olmstead does not require the immediate, state-wide deinstutionalization \nof all eligible developmentally disabled persons, nor that a State's plan be always and in all \n\ncases successful. Id. at 606, 119 S.Ct. 2176 (\"It is reasonable for the State to ask someone \nto wait until a community placement is available.\") (endorsing position of State of Georgia). \nThe record supports the district court's finding that California has a successful record of \npersonalized evaluations leading to a reasonable rate of deinstutionalization and, moreover, \nthat California has undertaken to continue and to increase its efforts to place current \nresidents of Developmental Centers into the community when such placement is feasible. \nSanchez's and the Providers' requested relief would require us to disrupt this working plan \nand to restrict impermissibly the leeway that California is permitted in its operation of \ndevelopmentally disabled services under Olmstead. \nIV \nCongress did not unambiguously create an individually enforceable right in § 30(A) that \nwould be remediable under § 1983 either by recipients or providers of Medicaid services. \nFurthermore, Sanchez's and the Providers' requested relief under Title II of the ADA and § \n504 of the Rehabilitation Act would require the \"fundamental alteration\" of a comprehensive, \nworking plan for deinstitutionalization in contravention ofOlmstead. \nAFFIRMED. \n[*] The Honorable Robert E. Cowen, Senior United States Circuit Judge for the Third Circuit, sitting by designation. \n[1] The program was established under 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(1), which provides, in part, that: \nThe Secretary may by waiver provide that a State plan approved under this title [42 USCS §§ 1396 et seq.] may \ninclude as \"medical assistance\" under such plan payment for part or all of the cost of home or community-based \nservices (other than room and board) approved by the Secretary which are provided pursuant to a written plan of care \nto individuals with respect to whom there has been a determination that but for the provision of such services the \nindividuals would require the level of care provided in a hospital or a nursing facility or intermediate care facility for the \nmentally retarded the cost of which could be reimbursed under the State plan. \n[2] Gonzaga involved an alleged violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (\"FERPA\"), 20 \nU.S.C. § 1232g, which prohibits \"the federal funding of educational institutions that have a policy or practice of \nreleasing education records to unauthorized persons.\" 536 U.S. at 276, 122 S.Ct. 2268. Gonzaga University \ndisclosed a student's alleged sexual misconduct to the state agency responsible for teacher certification, whereupon \nthe student sued to enforce the privacy provisions of FERPA. The Court held that \"such an action [was] foreclosed \nbecause the relevant provisions of FERPA create no personal rights to enforce under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\" Id. \n[3] Justice Stevens, writing in dissent in Gonzaga, even suggested that the reasoning in Wilder is so out of step with \nthe Court's holding in Gonzaga that it has been effectively overruled. Id. at 300 n. 8,122 S.Ct. 2268 (Stevens, J., \ndissenting) (\"[Imposing the implied right of action framework upon the § 1983 inquiry] sub silentio overrules cases \nsuch as Wright and Wilder. In those cases we concluded that the statutes at issue created rights enforceable under § \n1983, but the statutes did not `clearly and unambiguously,' ... intend enforceability under § 1983.\") \n[4] The Medicaid Act was promulgated under Congress's spending power, see Pharm. Research & Mfrs. of Am. v. \nWalsh, 538 U.S. 644, 682-83, 123 S.Ct. 1855, 155 L.Ed.2d 889 (2003) (Thomas, J., concurring), which is \nencompassed in Art. I, § 8, cl. 1, of the United States Constitution. One of the few enumerated grants of federal \nlegislative authority, see Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 176 1 Cranch 137, 176, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803) (Marshall, C.J.) \n\n(\"The powers of the legislature are defined, and limited; and that those limits may not be mistaken, or forgotten, the \nconstitution is written.\"), the Spending Clause states that \"Congress shall have Power To ... provide for the ... general \nWelfare of the United States.\" In Pennhurst, the Court advised that, when reviewing legislation enacted pursuant to \nthe spending power, courts should be especially reluctant to conclude that Congress intended to create a new \nindividual right enforceable against the States. Because of the quasi-contractual nature of Congress's spending \npower, states accepting funds from the federal government must be aware of the conditions attached to the receipt of \nthose funds so that they can be said to have \"voluntarily and knowingly accept[ed] the terms of the `contract.'\" 451 \nU.S. at 17, 101 S.Ct. 1531. (citing Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, 301 U.S. 548, 585-598, 57 S.Ct. 883, 81 L.Ed. \n1279 (1937); Harris v. McRae,448 U.S. 297, 100 S.Ct. 2671, 65 L.Ed.2d 784 (1980)). \"Accordingly, if Congress \nintends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, it must do so unambiguously .... [and] speak with a \nclear voice [in order to] enable the States to exercise their choice knowingly, cognizant of the consequences of their \nparticipation.\" Id. \n[5] Relying on an opaque item of legislative history, Sanchez and the Providers argue that the district court erred by \nfocusing unduly on the explicit text of the statute to the exclusion of legislative intent. They allege that classic \"rights-\ncreating\" language could not be used in § 30(A), since the section is included as part of the state plan requirements \nand that, in 1994, Congress amended the Medicaid Act to provide that \n[i]n an action brought to enforce a provision of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. §§ 301 et seq.], such provision is not \nto be deemed unenforceable because of its inclusion in a section of the Act requiring a State plan or specifying the \nrequired contents of a State plan. This section is not intended to limit or expand the grounds for determining the \navailability of private actions to enforce State plan requirements other than by overturning any such grounds applied \nin Suter v. Artist M., 503 U.S. 347, 112 S.Ct. 1360, 118 L.Ed.2d 1 (1992) but not applied in prior Supreme Court \ndecisions respecting such enforceability; provided, however, that this section is not intended to alter the holding \nin Suter v. Artist M. that section 471(a)(15) of the Act [42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(15)] is not enforceable in a private right of \naction. \n42 U.S.C. § 1320a-2; accord 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-10. Although this text is hardly a model of clarity, the caveat that it \"is \nnot intended to limit or expand the grounds for determining the availability of private actions to enforce State plan \nrequirements\" shows that, at the very least, it does not disturb the Supreme Court's reasoning in Pennhurst, which \nwas decided prior to Suter. And as we are bound to follow the Court's holdings in Blessing and Gonzaga, which \nfollowed the enactment of 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-2, this provision does not disturb the general framework that we — and \nthe district court in this case — have used to analyze private rights of action under § 1983. \n[6] 42 U.S.C. § 12132 (§ 202 of the ADA) provides, in part, that: \n[N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be \ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity. \n29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (§ 504 of the Rehabilitation Act) provides, in part, that: \nNo otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States ... shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, \nbe excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program \nor activity receiving Federal financial assistance.... \n[7] We have held that, while \"[t]he section of Justice Ginsburg's opinion discussing the state's fundamental alteration \ndefense commanded only four votes ... [b]ecause it relied on narrower grounds than did Justice Stevens' concurrence \nor Justice Kennedy's concurrence, both of which reached the same result, Justice Ginsburg's opinion \ncontrols.\" Townsend v. Quasim, 328 F.3d 511, 519 n. 3 (9th Cir.2003). \n[8] Under the Lanterman Act, all developmentally disabled persons are entitled to services funded out of the State's \ngeneral funds. However, only seventy percent of these developmentally disabled persons qualify for Medicaid funding \non the basis of financial need. In addition, many of the developmentally disabled persons eligible for services under \nthe Lanterman Act do not have a level of impairment which would qualify them for matching funds from the federal \ngovernment under California's HCBS waiver program. \n[9] The district court noted that, \"[o]f the 436 people admitted into Developmental Centers since January, 1999, \nalmost forty percent were committed by a court.\" \n\n[10] Olmstead also specifically disapproved two methods of analyzing whether a requested modification is financially \nreasonable, or whether it amounts to a \"fundamental alteration\" of a State's services. First, it held that measuring the \ncost of placing one or two disabled people in the community against the entirety of the State's budget for treatment of \nthat disability is inappropriate because the requested relief will almost always appear to be a reasonable \nmodification. 527 U.S. at 603-604, 119 S.Ct. 2176. Second, the Court held that it was not appropriate merely to \ncompare the cost of institutionalization against the cost of community-based services, because that comparison \nwould not account for the State's financial obligation to continue to operate partially full institutions with fixed \noverhead costs. Id. at 604 n. 15, 119 S.Ct. 2176. Even if a community-based placement would be less costly than an \ninstitutional placement for a specific individual, the State must still factor into its overall budget the fixed cost of \nmaintaining some necessary number of state institutions. \n ",
