She alleged violations of 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, and the Washington State Constitution.  The suit arose from the treatment of her when she gave birth while incarcerated.  She alleged that in violation of prison policy she had been shackled throughout labor and after she had given birth.  She was only unshackled for an emergency cesarean section and was immediately shackled again after surgery.  She  sought declaratory relief, damages, and attorney's fees and costs for her great emotional and physical pain.  </p><p>As the suit proceeded, all individually named defendants were dismissed with the exception of two correctional officers. The plaintiff indicated she would no longer seek declaratory relief against the State of Washington and acknowledged that the Eleventh Amendment precluded her from recovering damages against the state of any state agencies.  On May 3, 2010 the court (Judge Robert Jensen Bryan) issued an order concerning cross-motions for summary judgment.  The plaintiff's motion for summary judgment was denied, the officers' claim of qualified immunity was denied, and the defendants' motion for summary judgment was granted in part and denied in part.  The case came to a close on May 7, 2010 when the court (Judge Bryan) entered a stipulated order dismissing all remaining claims against all defendants after the parties reached a settlement.  The details of the settlement are not known.</p><p></p>",

BRYAN, District Judge. \nThis matter comes before the Court on the Defendants' Amended Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. 22 \nrefiled as 34), Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Dkt. 27) and Defendants' motions to strike \n(Dkts. 44 and 46). The Court has considered the pleadings filed in support and in opposition to the \nmotions and the record. \nI. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \nThirty year old Plaintiff, Casandra Brawley, brings this case seeking relief from violations of her \nconstitutional rights that she alleges occurred during the birth of her first child in April of 2007. Dkt. 1. \nA. FACTS \nIn 2004, Plaintiff was sent to the Washington State Corrections Center for Women (\"WCCW\") to serve an \napproximately year long sentence after a possession of stolen property conviction. Dkt. 28, at 2. She was \nreleased early for good time served. Dkt. 28, at 2. Plaintiff has never been convicted of a violent crime. \nDkt. 28, at 2. Plaintiff has seven total felony convictions, including one from 2006 for second degree theft. \nDkts. 28, at 2 and 30-2, at 11. Plaintiff was sent back to the WCCW in December of 2006 to serve \nfourteen months on the second degree theft conviction. Dkt. 28, at 2. Plaintiff was five months pregnant, \nhaving a due date of April 16, 2007. Dkt. 28, at 2 and 3. When she began her 2006 sentence, she had \ntwo outstanding warrants for felonies in two other counties. Dkt. 28, at 2. When she began her sentence \nshe was classified as \"medium security.\" Dkt. 28, at 2. Kevin Mauss, a Correctional Program Manager at \n\nthe WCCW, states that Plaintiff was classified as \"medium security\" because of the two outstanding \nwarrants, and because she had an incident of failing to report while on community supervision, and so \nwas placed on \"escape status\" then. Dkt. 25, at 3. \nPlaintiff states that anytime she was transported from WCCW for prenatal care, she was placed in full \nrestraints. Dkt. 28, at 2. She states that \"full restraints\" meant that she had a metal chain around her waist, \nher hands were handcuffed together, and the handcuffs were attached to the waist chain. Dkt. 28, at 2. \nShe asserts that the chains were humiliating and uncomfortable. Dkt. 28, at 2. \nOn April 13, 2007, Plaintiff states that she woke up around 4:00 a.m. and noticed that she was leaking \nfluid. Dkt. 28, at 3. She states that this was her first baby and she did not know what to expect. Dkt. 28, \n1212*1212 at 3. Plaintiff states that she went to the officer on duty, who called the clinic, and they \neventually decided to send her back to bed. Dkt. 28, at 3. She reported another \"gush of water\" at 8:00 \na.m., went to the medical clinic, and they decided to send her to St. Joseph Hospital in Tacoma, \nWashington. Dkt. 28, at 3-4. Plaintiff states that she was stripped-searched and put in an orange jumpsuit. \nDkt. 28, at 4. Plaintiff states that she was put in full restraints and transported to the hospital. Dkt. 28, at 4. \nShe was examined by medical personnel who determined that she had not ruptured her membranes and \nwas not in labor. Dkts. 28, at 4, and 30-2, at 45. Plaintiff was returned to the WCCW in full restraints. Dkt. \n28, at 4. \nPlaintiff reported continued leaking and so spent the night in the WCCW's clinic. Dkts. 28, at 4 and 30-2, \nat 25. Treatment notes from L.K. Wilts, R.N., indicate that Plaintiff denied having any contractions. Dkt. \n30-2, at 25. Nurse Wilts suspected \"Braxton Hicks contractions.\" Dkt. 30-2, at 25. She was returned to her \nunit on April 14, 2007. Dkt. 30-2, at 25. \nThe next day, April 15, 2007, around 6:00 p.m., Plaintiff returned to the WCCW's clinic and reported \nhaving contractions four to five minutes apart. Dkt. 30-2, at 25. Nurse Melissa Morgan noted on the fetal \nmonitor that Plaintiff's contractions were three minutes apart and lasting 30 seconds. Dkts. 30-2, at 25, \nand 30-3, at 6. Plaintiff reported that she was in a lot of pain from the contractions. Dkt. 28, at 5. She \nreports contractions in her abdomen and lower back. Dkt. 28, at 5. Nurse Morgan stated that she filled out \na transfer form to tell the shift office and transporting officers that Plaintiff need to be taken to the hospital \nbecause nurse Morgan thought that Plaintiff was in labor. Dkt. 30-3, at 6. The Incident Report states that \nPlaintiff was to be transported to the hospital \"due to the possibility of active labor.\" Dkt. 30-3, at 37. The \nreport states that Officers Brydee Glasco and Herbert Joy, the remaining Defendants here, \"will transport \nvia a state vehicle and have been advised of this situation.\" Dkt. 30-3, at 37. \nPlaintiff states that she was strip-searched, put on the orange jumpsuit, and placed in full restraints. Dkt. \n28, at 5. Officer Glasco, a mother herself, testified that she was aware that DOC policy at the time stated \nthat offenders would not be restrained during labor and delivery, but that the policy did not say they would \nnot be restrained during transportation. Dkt. 30-3, at 14. Officer Glasco acknowledges that it was contrary \nto DOC policy to use waist chains while transporting women in the third trimester of pregnancy. Dkt. 30-3, \nat 14. Officer Glasco states that when her supervisor told her she was transporting Plaintiff, she was not \ntold Plaintiff posed any risk of harm or escape. Dkt. 30-3, at 15. Officer Glasco denies Plaintiff was put in \na waist restraint, and maintains that Plaintiff was only handcuffed in the front. Dkt. 30-3, at 15. Officer \nGlasco states that the clinic nursing staff, she can't remember who, told her that Plaintiff was full term, \nhad a fever, did not feel well, and needed to be seen at St. Joseph's hospital. Dkt. 30-3, at 16. Officer \nGlasco denies ever being told that Plaintiff was having contractions and that the contractions were \ncoming at regular intervals. Dkt. 30-3, at 16. Officer Glasco states that she asked Plaintiff if her water \nbroke, and Plaintiff stated that she did not think so. Dkt. 30-3, at 16. Officer Glasco states that she asked \nPlaintiff if she was having contractions and Plaintiff denied having any contractions. Dkt. 30-3, at 16. \nOfficer Glasco testified that she felt that if an inmate was in active labor, it was not appropriate to restrain \nthe inmate. Dkt. 23-3 at 19. Officer Joy was armed with a gun. Dkt. 30-3, at 30. \n1213*1213 On the way to the hospital the evening of April 15, 2007, Officer Joy drove the car, Officer \nGlasco sat in the front, and Plaintiff sat in the back. Dkt. 30-3, at 17. Plaintiff states that while on the drive \n\nto St. Joseph's hospital, Defendant Officer Glasco was timing her contractions with a watch. Dkts. 28, at 6, \n30-2, at 4. Plaintiff states that during this 20 or so minute drive, the contractions were about two minutes \napart. Dkt. 28, at 6. Officer Glasco contradicts Plaintiffs assertions, testifying that during the drive she \nrepeatedly asked Plaintiff whether she was having contractions, and Plaintiff denied them, just saying that \nshe did not feel good, that she was in pain. Dkt. 30-3, at 18. \nWhen they arrived at the hospital, around 7:00-7:30 p.m., the officers put Plaintiff into a wheelchair. Dkt. \n28, at 6 and 30-2, at 5. Officer Joy states that he remembers one of the nurses being upset that there was \na male officer escorting a woman who was \"obviously in labor.\" Dkt. 30-3, at 32-33. Officer Joy states that \nhe told the nurse \"deal with it, because [he's] not going anywhere.\" Dkt. 30-3, at 33. Officer Joy states that \nhe stayed outside the room when Plaintiff had vaginal examinations. Dkt. 30-2, at 33. Officer Joy stated \nthat he stayed on the other side of a privacy curtain. Dkt. 30-3, at 33. Plaintiff states that once they got \ninto an examination room, the officers took the waist chain and handcuffs off, and chained her ankle to \nthe bed. Dkt. 28, at 6. Plaintiff was put in a hospital gown and a fetal monitor was attached to her \nabdomen. Dkt. 30-3, at 19. Plaintiff reports very painful contractions at this point. Dkt. 28 at 6. She states \nthat the chain attaching her ankle to the bed gave her \"enough room to turn from side to side a little bit, \nbut not fully.\" Dkt. 28, at 6. She could not get up and stand or walk. Dkt. 28, at 6. She reports being \nunable to get in any other position that would help relieve the pain. Dkt. 28, at 6. Plaintiff reports feeling \npanicked when she was told that the hospital staff was thinking of sending her back to WCCW because \nher labor was not progressing. Dkt. 28, at 6. Plaintiff asked them to please not send her back. Dkt. 28, at \n6. Officer Glasco states that she has had children herself and has been around several other women who \nwere having contractions. Dkt. 30-3, at 20. Officer Glasco states that she was in the room with Plaintiff the \nwhole four hours prior to her admission, and Plaintiff did not seem to be having contractions. Dkt. 30-3, at \n20. \nAround 11:00 p.m., Plaintiff was admitted to the hospital. Dkt. 30-2, at 35. Her admission form indicates \nthat she was having contractions and vaginal spotting. Dkt. 30-2, at 35. Her temperature was \"99+,\" and \nher son's heart rate was 170 beats per minute, leading to the impression that he had fetal tachycardia. \nDkt. 30-2, at 35. Officer Glasco states that as soon as Plaintiff was admitted, Officer Joy left. Dkt. 30-3, at \n21. Officer Glasco states that she doesn't think that she was told that Plaintiff was being admitted for \ndelivery of the baby. Dkt. 30-3, at 21. She states that she recalls the hospital staff saying that she needed \nto be admitted because of the \"fever and the condition of the child ... something is going on ... it could be \nan infection.\" Dkt. 30-3, at 21. Plaintiff states that once admitted, an IV was inserted and she was moved \ninto a birthing room. Dkt. 28, at 7. She states that Officer Glasco chained her to a wheelchair to move her \nand then chained her to the bed in the birthing room. Dkt. 28, at 7. Plaintiff reports \"intense, hard labor \npains\" at this point. Dkt. 28, at 7. Plaintiff states that the chain made it hard to move in bed, and she could \nnot get up and move around. Dkt. 28, at 7. Sometime before 11:45 p.m., Plaintiff was given an epidural. \nDkts. 28, at 7 and 30-2, at 37. She was unchained long enough for medical staff to insert the epidural, \nand then re-chained to 1214*1214 the bed. Dkt. 28, at 7. Officer Glasco reports that she understood at \nthat point the epidural was given for pain and so Plaintiff could attempt a vaginal delivery. Dkt. 30-3, at 22. \nHospital treatment notes indicate that Plaintiff was comfortable on the epidural. Dkt. 30-2, at 37. She \nreports that within minutes of having the epidural, her temperature \"suddenly went up and the baby's \nheartbeat was way too high.\" Dkt. 28, at 7. She reports that the nurses tried putting cold towels on her \nand giving her Tylenol, but it did not help. Dkt. 28, at 7. She states that they tried to break her membranes, \nand discovered that she had no amniotic fluid left. Dkt. 28, at 7. She was given oxygen. Dkts. 28, at 7 and \n30-2, at 37. \nAt around 1:30 a.m. on April 16, 2007, Plaintiff consented to an emergency cesarean. Dkt. 30-2, at 37. \nPlaintiff's leg restraint was removed just prior to surgery. Dkts. 28, at 7, and 30-3, at 23. Around 2:30 a.m., \nPlaintiff's son was born. Dkt. 30-2, at 38. Carol Sarner, M.D. performed the surgery and her diagnosis \nwas \"term intrauterine pregnancy, chorioamnionitis, fetal tachycardia, failure to dilate, prolonged rupture \nof membranes.\" Dkt. 30-2, at 38. Plaintiff's son was immediately taken to the neonatal intensive care unit \n(\"NICU\") to receive antibiotics. Dkt. 28, at 8. Plaintiff reports that right after surgery, before she could even \nfeel her legs, Officer Glasco chained her to the bed again. Dkt. 28, at 8. Officer Glasco states that she \n\nchained Plaintiff to the bed in the postrecovery room after the nurses \"cleared her for restraining.\" Dkt. 30-\n3, at 23. \nA few hours later, Plaintiff was brought in a wheelchair to the NICU to see her son. Dkt. 28, at 8. She \nreports being chained to the wheelchair. Dkt. 28, at 8. She states that she could walk only one or two \nsteps at this point. Dkt. 28, at 8. \nPlaintiff states that after 24 hours in the NICU, her son was allowed to move into her room. Dkt. 28, at 8. \nHe was taken to the NICU every four hours for more medicine. Dkt. 28, at 8. Plaintiff was chained to the \nbed. Dkt. 28, at 8. She states that once her son was returned from the NICU, after receiving his medicine, \nout of her reach. Dkt. 28, at 8. Plaintiff states that the baby made a noise like he was choking or was \nvomiting, so she called for help. Dkts. 28, at 8 and 30-2, at 10. Plaintiff states that she pulled and pulled \nherself against the chains, but could not reach him. Dkts. 28, at 8, and 30-2, at 10. She reports being in \npain and being \"terrified.\" Dkt. 28, at 9. Plaintiff states that she had difficulty doing the walking the nurses \nwanted her to do after her surgery because of the leg restraints Defendants forced her to wear. Dkt. 28, at \n9. \nPlaintiff was discharged from the hospital on April 19, 2007. Dkt. 30-2, at 43. Plaintiff was released from \nWCCW on May 10, 2007. Dkt. 30-2, at 10. \nThe Washington State Department of Corrections' policy in place at the time, Restricted Policy 420.250, \nprovides: \"[a] female offender will not be restrained during labor and delivery of an infant.\" Dkt. 39, at 10. \nB. PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nOn June 25, 2009, Plaintiff filed this case. Dkt. 1. She makes a claim for violation of her right to be free \nfrom cruel and unusual punishment under both the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution \n(via 42 U.S.C. § 1983) and Article 1, Section 14 of the Washington State Constitution. Id. She seeks \ndeclaratory relief that the Defendants violated her rights under both the federal and state constitution. Id. \nShe also seeks damages, attorneys' fees, and costs. Id. \n1215*1215 Parties have now filed cross motions for summary judgment. Dkts. 34 and 27. Defendants \nseek summary dismissal of Plaintiff's claims. Dkt. 34. Plaintiff seeks partial summary judgment on her \nEighth Amendment claim against Officer Glasco. Dkt. 27. Some of the issues raised in these motions are \nnow resolved (see the discussion in the next section). The outstanding issues are summarized in Section \nI.D. below. \nC. RESOLVED ISSUES \nWith the exception of Officers Glasco and Joy, all individually named Defendants have been dismissed by \nstipulation. Dkts. 16, 18, and 38. To the extent that Defendants' motion for summary judgment seeks \ndismissal of these dismissed parties, it should be denied as moot. Further, Plaintiff states in her response \nto Defendants' motion for summary judgment, that she will not pursue her claim for declaratory relief \nunder either federal or Washington law. Dkt. 42, at 2. To the extent that Defendants seek dismissal of \nthese claims in their motion for summary judgment, the motion should be granted and those claims \ndismissed. Plaintiff does not dispute that monetary damages are not available here against the Defendant \nState of Washington and its agency, the Department of Corrections, pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment \nto the United States Constitution. Pittman v. Oregon Employment Dept., 509 F.3d 1065, 1071 (9th \nCir.2007) (internal quotations omitted) (as the Supreme Court has applied the Eleventh Amendment, an \nunconsenting State is immune from suits brought in federal courts by her own citizens as well as by \ncitizens of another State absent certain exceptions). Defendants' motion seeking dismissal of the \ndamages claims against Washington and the Department of Corrections should be granted. \n\nD. SUMMARY OF REMAINING ISSUES \nPlaintiff states that her remaining claims are that Officers Glasco and Joy \"violated her Eighth \nAmendment right to be free of cruel and unusual punishment when they shackled her during labor and \nimmediately postpartum on April 15 and 16, 2007.\" Dkt. 42. \nDefendants move for dismissal of Plaintiff's remaining claim, arguing that Plaintiff did not suffer any \nconstitutional infringement, even if she did, her rights were not clearly established and so Officers Glasco \nand Joy are entitled to qualified immunity. Dkts. 34, and 44. Defendants also argue that her claims should \nbe dismissed because Plaintiff failed to exhaust her remedies under the Prison Litigation Reform Act \n(\"PLRA\") and the doctrine of laches bars Plaintiff's claims. Id. \nPlaintiff moves for summary judgment against Officer Glasco, arguing that shackling her during labor and \nimmediately postpartum violated her Eighth Amendment rights, and those rights were clearly established \nat the time. Dkts. 27 and 42. Plaintiff argues that because she was out of prison when she filed her \ncomplaint, she did not need to exhaust under the PLRA. Dkt. 42, at 5 (citing Talamantes v. Leyva, 575 \nF.3d 1021, 1023 (9th Cir.2009)). Plaintiff argues that Defendants failed to plead laches in their answer, \nthereby waiving the defense. Dkt. 42, at 6. Plaintiff argues that even if Defendants did not waive the \ndefense, Plaintiff filed her case within the statute of limitations and there is no basis to shorten the time \nallowed by law to file her claim. Dkt. 42, at 6. \nDefendants move to strike Exhibits 3 and Exhibits 20-24 to the Declaration of Michael Wampold. Dkt. 44. \nDefendants move to strike any evidence related to actions or activities after 6:00 a.m. on April 16, 2007. \nDkt. 44. Defendants move to 1216*1216 strike the unsupported \"opinions\" of Dr. Thomas Easterling. Dkt. \n44. Defendants also move to strike exhibits 2 and 3 of Plaintiff's Opposition to Defendants' motion (Dkt. \n43, at 7-36). Dkt. 46. \nThis opinion will first address the motion to strike, then the issues of PLRA exhaustion and laches. This \nopinion will lastly address the core issue of qualified immunity. \nII. DISCUSSION \nA. MOTION TO STRIKE \nDefendants' motion to strike (Dkt. 44) should be denied, in part, and granted, in part. Defendants move to \nstrike Exhibit 3 to the Declaration of Michael Wampold. Dkt. 44. Exhibit 3 purports to be a \"custody \nreview\" sheets. Dkt. 30-2, at 20. These pleadings (Dkt. 30-2, at 20-22) should be stricken as no \nfoundation has been laid for the document's authenticity. Fed. R. Ev. 602. \nDefendants' motion to strike Exhibit 20 to the Declaration of Michael Wampold should be granted. Exhibit \n20 is a June 2007 letter from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologist stating it opposes \nshackling inmates in labor. Dkt. 30-4, at 16. Consideration of that document was not necessary to decide \nthese motions. \nDefendants' motion to strike Exhibit 21-24 to the Declaration of Michael Wampold should be granted. \nThese pleadings are articles from various sources opposing shackling inmates in labor. They also are \nunnecessary and are of limited relevance. \nDefendants' motion to strike any evidence related to actions or activities after 6:00 a.m. on April 16, 2007, \nshould be denied to the extent that this evidence provides background facts. Dkt. 44. \n\nFor the purposes of this motion alone, Defendants motion to strike the opinions of Dr. Thomas Easterling \nshould be denied. Dkt. 44. Some of Defendants' discussion of his opinion was well taken, but that \nevidence was not necessary to decide this motion. \nDefendants' motion to strike (Dkt. 46) should be granted. Exhibits 2 and 3 of Plaintiff's Opposition to \nDefendants' motion, (Dkt. 43, at 7-36), complaints purportedly filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern \nDistrict of Illinois and U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. These pleadings are of \nlimited relevance and were not considered. \nB. PLRA EXHAUSTION and LACHES \n1. PLRA \nA person not incarcerated or detained at the time an action is filed is not a \"prisoner\" for purposes of the \nPLRA, and therefore, not subject to the exhaustion requirement. Talamantes v. Leyva, 575 F.3d 1021, \n1023 (9th Cir.2009). It is undisputed that Plaintiff was not \"incarcerated or detained\" at the time the \nComplaint was filed. Defendants' motion to summarily dismiss Plaintiff's claims based on Plaintiff's failure \nto exhaust her administrative remedies under the PLRA should be denied. \n2. Laches \n\"The doctrine of laches is a creature of equity and is grounded upon the principles of equitable \nestoppel.\" Rutter v. Rutter's Estate, 59 Wash.2d 781, 784, 370 P.2d 862 (1962). Laches does not bar an \naction short of the applicable statute of limitations \"unless it is made to appear that, by reason of the delay \nin asserting a claim, the other party has altered his position or has been otherwise injured by the delay.\" \nId. \nTo the extent Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiff's claims for declaratory relief through the doctrine of \nlaches, this opinion 1217*1217 has already held that those claims should be dismissed and so the motion \nis moot. To the extent that Defendants use the doctrine to defend against her other claims, the motion \nshould be denied. It is undisputed that Plaintiff filed this action within the applicable statute of limitations. \nDefendants make no showing that by reason of the delay Plaintiff has altered their position. Defendants \nmake no showing that they have been \"otherwise injured by the delay.\" Defendants motion to summarily \ndismiss Plaintiff's claims on the doctrine of laches should be denied. \n3. Conclusion \nPlaintiff was not required to exhaust her administrative remedies under the PLRA. The doctrine of laches \ndoes not bar Plaintiff's claim for damages, attorney's fees, and costs. This opinion will now turn to the \ncore of the case, whether the officers here are entitled to summary judgment on their qualified immunity \ndefense. \nC. SUMMARY JUDGMENT—STANDARD \nSummary judgment is proper only if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and \nadmissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any \nmaterial fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). The \nmoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law when the nonmoving party fails to make a \nsufficient showing on an essential element of a claim in the case on which the nonmoving party has the \n\nburden of proof. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). \nThere is no genuine issue of fact for trial where the record, taken as a whole, could not lead a rational \ntrier of fact to find for the non moving party. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. \n574, 586, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986) (nonmoving party must present specific, significant \nprobative evidence, not simply \"some metaphysical doubt.\"); See also Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e). Conversely, a \ngenuine dispute over a material fact exists if there is sufficient evidence supporting the claimed factual \ndispute, requiring a judge or jury to resolve the differing versions of the truth. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, \nInc., 477 U.S. 242, 253, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986); T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Pac. Elec. \nContractors Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 630 (9th Cir. 1987). \nThe determination of the existence of a material fact is often a close question. The court must consider \nthe substantive evidentiary burden that the nonmoving party must meet at trial—e.g., a preponderance of \nthe evidence in most civil cases. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 254, 106 S.Ct. 2505; T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc., 809 \nF.2d at 630. The court must resolve any factual issues of controversy in favor of the nonmoving party only \nwhen the facts specifically attested by that party contradict facts specifically attested by the moving party. \nThe nonmoving party may not merely state that it will discredit the moving party's evidence at trial, in the \nhopes that evidence can be developed at trial to support the claim. T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc., 809 F.2d at 630 \n(relying on Anderson, supra). Conclusory, non specific statements in affidavits are not sufficient, and \nmissing facts will not be presumed. Lujan v. Nat'l Wildlife Fed'n, 497 U.S. 871, 888-89, 110 S.Ct. 3177, \n111 L.Ed.2d 695 (1990). \nD. QUALIFIED IMMUNITY \n\"[G]overnment officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil \ndamages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of \nwhich a reasonable person would have known.\" Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 1218*1218 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 \nS.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). \"Through application of the qualified immunity doctrine, public \nservants avoid the general costs of subjecting officials to the costs of trial—distraction of officials from \ntheir governmental duties, inhibition of discretionary action, and deterrence of able people from public \nservice.\" V-1 Oil Co. v. Smith, 114 F.3d 854, 857 (9th Cir.1997) (internal citations omitted). The immunity \nis \"immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability.\" Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526, 105 \nS.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985). \nThe Supreme Court established a two-part analysis in Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, \n150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001), for determining whether qualified immunity is appropriate in a suit against a \npublic official for an alleged violation of a constitutional right. Boyd v. Benton County, 374 F.3d 773, 778 \n(9th Cir.2004), citing Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001). \nAlthough no longer mandatory, the Supreme Court has recently held that it may be \"beneficial\" for a court \nrequired to rule upon qualified immunity to examine the Saucier factors: (1) whether the official violated \nthe plaintiff's constitutional rights on the facts alleged and (2) if there was a violation, whether the \nconstitutional rights were clearly established. Pearson v. Callahan, ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 808, 172 \nL.Ed.2d 565 (2009) (holding that the Saucier two-part analysis was no longer mandatory). Application of \nthe factors is beneficial here, so this opinion will first turn to whether Plaintiff's Eighth Amendment rights \nwere violated, and then if they were violated, whether they were clearly established in April of 2007. \n1. Violation of Constitutional Rights? \nThe Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the use of \"cruel and unusual \npunishment.\" The Eighth Amendment is applied to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment. Wilson v. \nSeiter, 501 U.S. 294, 296-97, 111 S.Ct. 2321, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991). The \"unnecessary and wanton \ninfliction of pain constitutes cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth Amendment.\" Hope v. \nPelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 737, 122 S.Ct. 2508, 153 L.Ed.2d 666 (2002) (some internal quotation marks \nomitted). \"Among unnecessary and wanton inflictions of pain are those that are totally without penological \n\njustification.\" Id. (internal citations omitted). In making this determination in the context of prison \nconditions, the court must \"ascertain whether the officials involved acted with `deliberate indifference' to \nthe inmates' health or safety.\" Id., at 738, 122 S.Ct. 2508 (internal citations omitted). \nThe Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment also imposes duties on prison \nofficials, \"who must provide humane conditions of confinement; prison officials must ensure that inmates \nreceive adequate food, clothing, shelter, and medical care, and must take reasonable measures to \nguarantee the safety of the inmates.\" Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 833, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d \n811 (1994) (internal citations omitted). \"Deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners\" \nconstitutes a violation of the Eighth Amendment. Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 \nL.Ed.2d 251 (1976). \nThere is no Ninth Circuit case addressing whether the shackling of inmates during labor and delivery of \ninfants violates the Eighth Amendment. Plaintiff here argues that she is making a essentially a \"hybrid\" \nclaim. Dkt. 27, at 19. She states: \nOne aspect of her serious medical need—to deliver her baby—was met by prison officials, who took her \nto the hospital 1219*1219 (eventually) for assistance with childbirth. Yet, in shackling Ms. Brawley \nthroughout labor, corrections officers interfered with her serious medical needs by putting her health and \nher pregnancy risk. The presence of the shackles also inflicted both physical and psychological pain. \nWhile either serves as an independent basis for finding a sufficiently serious deprivation, their \ncoexistence is significant because that is precisely what renders the shackling of laboring women so \nobviously inhumane. \nDkt. 27, at 19. \nThere are two parts in the test that the Ninth Circuit uses to determine \"deliberate indifference\" in the \ncontext of cases alleging a failure to treat a serous medical need. Jett v. Penner, 439 F.3d 1091, 1096 \n(9th Cir.2006). \"First, the plaintiff must show a serious medical need,\" and \"[s]econd, the plaintiff must \nshow the defendant's response to the need was deliberately indifferent.\" Id. (internal citations omitted). \na. Substantial Risk to Health or Safety, or Serious \nMedical Need \nAt the first step here then, the question under the Eighth Amendment is whether prison officials exposed \nPlaintiff to a sufficiently substantial \"risk of serious damage\" to her future health, Farmer v. Brennan, 511 \nU.S. 825, 842-843, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994) (internal citation omitted), and/or whether she \nhad a serious medical need, Jett, 1096. The first step is judged from an objective point of view. \nThere is sufficient evidence in the record to conclude that Plaintiff endured unnecessary pain, was \nexposed to a sufficiently serious risk of harm, and had a serious medical need when she was shackled to \nthe hospital bed on April 15, 2010 and April 16, 2010. Common sense, and the DOC's own policy, tells us \nthat it is not good practice to shackle women to a hospital bed while they are in labor. Defendants \nacknowledge that there are issues of fact as to whether Plaintiff was in labor. Dkt. 44. The record, viewed \nin a light most favorable to Plaintiff, indicates that she was experiencing strong contractions, some that \nshe felt in her back, as early as when she presented to the WCCW clinic at 6:00 p.m. on April 15, 2007. \nDkts. 30-2, at 25, 30-3, at 6, and 28, at 5. There is evidence in the record that she continued to have \nmore and more painful contractions until she received her epidural in the hospital several hours later. \nDkts. 28-7, at 6; 30-2, at 35. \nThere is evidence in the record that Plaintiff endured unnecessary pain due to being chained to her bed. \nThomas R. Easterling, M.D. testified on behalf of Plaintiff. Dkt. 30-3, at 25. Dr. Easterling is a board \n\ncertified obstetrician-gynecologist. Dkt. 29, at 1. Dr. Easterling testified that \"[t]he ability to move and \nchange positions is integral to a woman trying to cope with pain, and so [Plaintiff's] ability to deal with pain \nby changing positions is severely impaired.\" Dkt. 30-3, at 26. \nFurther, there is evidence that Plaintiff was exposed to a sufficiently serious risk of harm and had a \nserious medical need— being in labor—when she was shackled on April 15 and 16, 2007. Dr. Easterling \ntestified that it is important for women who are in labor to be able to move around to avoid venocaval \nocclusion, hypertension, and fetal compromise. Dkt. 30-3, at 26. Defendants offer no evidence to counter \nthis opinion. \nMoreover, there is no evidence in the record which indicated that shackling Plaintiff was justified by any \nlegitimate penological concern. There is no evidence that Plaintiff was dangerous to herself or others. \nThere is no evidence that she posed a flight risk. The evidence shows that on April 15, 2007, when \nOfficers Glasco 1220*1220 and Joy took her to the hospital, at a minimum, she was a pregnant woman at \nor near full term, was running a fever, was in pain, and was moving slowly. Dkt. 23-3, at 43-45. \nPlaintiff has shown that there is sufficient evidence in the record, from an objective standpoint, that she \nhad a serious medical need and was exposed to an unnecessary risk of harm. The inquiry does not end \nhere, however. To prevail on her motion, Plaintiff must show that Officer Glasco was deliberately \nindifferent to that need or risk of harm. Jett, at 1096. \nb. Deliberate Indifference \nThe \"second prong-defendant's response to the need was deliberately indifferent-is satisfied by showing \n(a) a purposeful act or failure to respond to a prisoner's pain or possible medical need and (b) harm \ncaused by the indifference.\" Jett, at 1096. (internal citations omitted). \"Under this standard, the prison \nofficial must not only be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of \nserious harm exists, but that person must also draw the inference.\" Toguchi v. Chung, 391 F.3d 1051, \n(9th Cir.2004). Existence of this subjective state of mind may be inferred from the fact that the risk of \nharm is obvious. Hope, at 738, 122 S.Ct. 2508. \nAlthough they testify that they know that it was against DOC policy to shackle a woman in labor, there are \nissues of fact as to whether Officers Glasco and Joy were aware that Plaintiff was in labor when they took \nher to the hospital on April 15, 2007, and when Officer Glasco remained with her there until the birth of \nPlaintiff's son. Officer Glasco denied that she was told that Plaintiff was having contractions. Dkt. 30-3, at \n16. She testified that when she asked Plaintiff, Plaintiff denied having contractions on the ride to the \nhospital. Dkt. 30-3, at 16. Officer Glasco testified that in the four hours prior to Plaintiff's admission to the \nhospital, while in the examination room, Plaintiff did not seem to be having contractions. Dkt. 30-3, at 20. \nAlthough it strains the imagination, Officer Glasco maintains that she did not think Plaintiff was in labor \neven after the hospital staff gave Plaintiff an epidural which Officer Glasco acknowledges she knew was \nfor pain and so Plaintiff could attempt a vaginal birth. These are the kinds of credibility decisions left to the \nfact finder. There are issues of fact as to whether Officers Glasco and Joy were deliberately indifferent to \nthe risks of harm to Plaintiff and her serious medical needs when they shackled her. Plaintiff's motion for \nsummary judgment on the liability of Officer Glasco, then must be denied at this stage. (Plaintiff's motion \nfor summary judgment did not address the liability of Officer Joy.) \nThe inquiry does not end here, however, regarding Defendants' motion for summary judgment. The next \nquestion that must be determined is: even if Plaintiff is able to show that her constitutional rights were \nviolated, in order to overcome Defendants' motion for summary judgment on qualified immunity, Plaintiff \nmust show that her rights were clearly established at the time. \n2. Constitutional Rights Clearly Established? \n\nIn analyzing the second part of the Saucier test, the issue is \"whether the plaintiff's constitutional right was \nclearly established at the time of the injury.\" Boyd at 780. \"For a constitutional right to be clearly \nestablished, its contours must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what \nhe is doing violates that right.\" Id. at 780-781. \"In other words, an official who makes a reasonable \nmistake as to what the law requires under a given set of circumstances is entitled to the immunity \ndefense.\" Id. The Constitution, decisions of the United 1221*1221 States Supreme Court, and decisions \nof lower federal courts may provide notice of established constitutional rights. Hope, at 741-42, 122 S.Ct. \n2508. \nPlaintiff has made a sufficient showing that by April of 2007 shackling inmates while they are in labor was \nclearly established as a violation of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual \npunishment. Defendants admit that Washington Department of Correction's own policy prohibited it. \nAlthough not binding authority, the Eight Circuit recently held that a female inmate's \"protections from \nbeing shackled during labor had... been clearly established by decisions of the Supreme Court and the \nlower federal courts before September 2003.\" Nelson v. Correctional Medical Services, 583 F.3d 522, 533 \n(8th Cir.2009). The Nelson court noted that as early as 1994, a federal district court in the District of \nColumbia held that shackling an inmate in labor was a violation of female prisoner's constitutional \nrights. Women Prisoners of D.C. Dept. of Corrections v. District of Columbia, 877 F.Supp. 634 \n(D.D.C.1994), modified in part on other grounds, 899 F.Supp. 659 (D.D.C.1995). The Nelson court also \nreviewed the U.S. Supreme Court holding in Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 122 S.Ct. 2508, 153 L.Ed.2d \n666 (2002). In Hope, the Supreme Court held that under the circumstances presented in the case, \nhandcuffing an inmate to a hitching post was a violation of the Eighth Amendment. The Hope court held \nthat the prison officials had acted with deliberate indifference to Hope's health and safety in \"violation of \nthe Eighth Amendment by restraining him `[d]espite the clear lack of an emergency situation' in a manner \n`that created a risk of particular discomfort and humiliation.'\" Nelson, at 532 (quoting Hope, at 737-38, 122 \nS.Ct. 2508). The Nelson court concluded that the Supreme Court holding in Hope regarding shackling an \ninmate to a hitching post, and the holdings from the D.C. district courts was sufficient to show that the \nright not to be shackled during labor and delivery of an infant was clearly established. The Nelson court \nalso examined the Arkansas Department of Corrections regulations and found that they, too, discouraged \nthe shackling of the inmate in that case. Id., at 533. The Nelson court's reasoning is persuasive. \nAs in Nelson, a reasonable factfinder could determine from the record in this case that the Defendants \nwere not facing an emergency situation but nevertheless \"subjected [the Plaintiff] to a substantial risk of \nphysical harm, to the unnecessary pain caused by the [shackles] and the restricted position of \nconfinement ... [and] created a risk of particular discomfort and humiliation,\" such that qualified immunity \nshould be denied. Nelson, at 532. \n3. Conclusion on Qualified Immunity \nThere are issues of fact as to whether Officers Glasco and Joy violated Plaintiff's Eighth Amendment right \nto be free from cruel and unusual punishment. Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment against \nOfficer Glasco should be denied. Defendants' motion for summary dismissal of Plaintiff's Eighth \nAmendment claim on qualified immunity grounds should be denied. Plaintiff has shown evidence, if \nbelieved, that would demonstrate a violation of her clearly established rights, barring the qualified \nimmunity defense. \nIII. ORDER \nTherefore, it is hereby, ORDERED that: \n• Defendants' motion to strike (Dkt. 44) is GRANTED, IN PART, and DENIED, IN PART, as stated above; \n• Defendants' motion to strike (Dkt. 46) is GRANTED; \n\n1222*1222 • Defendants' Amended Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. 22 refiled as Dkt. 34) is \n• DENIED AS MOOT to the extent Defendants seek dismissal of parties already dismissed by stipulation, \n• DENIED as to dismissal based on Plaintiff's failure to exhaust or laches, \n• DENIED as to qualified immunity on Plaintiff's Eighth Amendment Claim, \n• GRANTED as to Plaintiff's claims for declaratory relief, and \n• GRANTED as to Plaintiff's damages claims against the State of Washington and the Washington State \nDepartment of Corrections; \n• Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Dkt. 27) is DENIED, \nThe Clerk of the Court is instructed to send uncertified copies of this Order to all counsel of record and to \nany party appearing pro se at said party's last known address. \n ",

WASHINGTON !lB1D1·1609 \nPHONE: (206) 624-6800 \nFAX: (206) 682·1.15 \n\n1  III.  FACTS \n2  3.1  In  April  2007,  Casandra  Brawley  was  incarcerated  at  the  Washington \n3  Corrections Center for Women near Gig Harbor, Washington.  She was serving a fourteen-\n4  month sentence for second degree theft- a nonviolent crime. \n5  3.2  Ms.  Brawley had  never  been  convicted  of a  violent crime.  She  was  an \n6  exemplary inmate who was never disciplined for any infraction.  She was released after less \n7  than seven months, without the need for probation, because her crime was non-violent and \n8  she was given credit for good time served. \n9  3.3  In April 2007, Ms. Brawley was also nine months pregnant. \n10  3.4  At 4:00 a.m. on April 13, 2007, Ms. Brawley'S amniotic sac ruptured, causing \n11  a slow  leak.  She immediately asked to  be  taken to  the prison clinic.  Instead,  she was \n12  permitted to talk to a clinic nurse by phone.  The nurse told her to go back to bed and report \n13  to \"sick call\" in the morning. \n14  3.5  At \"sick call\" three and a half hours later, the clinic nurse tested Ms. Brawley \n15  to  determine whether she was in labor, and decided to  send her to  St. Joseph Hospital in \n16  Tacoma,  Washington.  During  her  transportation  to  St.  Joseph.  DOC  agents  kept  Ms. \n17  Brawley shackled with a chain around her belly (known as a \"waist chain\") attached to hand \n18  cuffs.  At  the  hospital,  a  certified  nurse  midwife  asked  a  DOC  agent  to  remove  Ms. \n19  Brawley's waist  chain and  handcuffs  for  the  examination.  The  DOC agent agreed  and \n20  removed the restraints, but chained Ms. Brawley to a hospital bed by a metal chain ankle \n21  restraint, where she remained throughout the examination.  After examining her, the certified \n22  nurse midwife discharged Ms. Brawley with instructions to return if she had significant water \n23  leakage, excessive bleeding, or quick contractions.  Ms. Brawley was again restrained with \n24  the waist chain and handcuffs and transported back to WCCW. \n25  3.6  Because she continued to experience water leakage and believed she was in \n26  labor, Ms. Brawley returned to the prison clinic on Saturday, April 14,2007, where she was \nPETERSON YOUNG PUTRA \nCOMPLAlNT FOR DAMAGES \n1501 FOURTH AVENUE. SUITE 2900 \nAND DECLARATORY RELIEF -4  SEAffiE, WASHINGTON 98101-1609 \nPHONE: (206) 624.oaoo \nFAX: (206)6B2·1415 \n\n1  allowed to  stay overnight- at her insistence-for observation.  At 3:00· a.m. on April  14, \n2  2007, Ms. Brawley began to have contractions in her lower back and abdomen every eight \n3  minutes.  She was told - repeatedly and without explanation - that these were the \"wrong\" \n4  kind of contractions.  She was released seven hours later. \n5  3.7  At 4:00 p.m. on April 15,2007, Ms. Brawley's contractions were five minutes \n6  apart.  Because she feared that her reports of her labor would be treated dismissively once \n7  again, she waited an hour and a half, then reported her contractions to a corrections officer \n8  and asked to  be taken to the clinic.  She was taken to the clinic and monitored by clinic \n9  personnel.  After being subjected to what she was told was a routine strip search, she was \n10  shackled with a waist chain attached to hand cuffs and transported to the hospital by DOC \n11  agents. \n12  3.8  When she arrived at St. Joseph Hospital, DOC agents shackled Ms. Brawley \n13  to the hospital bed by one leg, using a metal ankle restraint attached to a metal chain.  During \n14  this time, Ms. Brawley was having painful and frequent labor contractions.  After five hours \n15  of laboring-in shackles  the entire time-she was given an epidural.  She was shackled \n16  throughout  that  medical  procedure.  After the  epidural,  Ms.  Brawley's temperature  was \n17  elevated  above  100  degrees  Fahrenheit.  She  was  given  antibiotics,  Tylenol  and  cold \n18  compresses,  which  failed  to  reduce her temperature.  Eventually she  was  given oxygen. \n19  During this process, DOC agents kept Ms. Brawley shackled to a hospital bed. \n20  3.9  A physician then attempted to induce labor by breaking the amniotic sac, but \n21  found  the  sac empty.  Left leaking  and  untreated  for  two  days,  her uterus  had  become \n22  infected.  The fetal heartbeat was dangerously accelerated, as well.  During this process, Ms. \n23  Brawley remained shackled to a hospital bed. \n24  3.10  At  1:30  a.m.  on  April  16,  2007,  an  on-call  physician  determined  that a \n25  caesarean section was necessary for the health of both mother and child, and Ms. Brawley \n26  consented. It was only then that she was freed  from the restraints, because the physician \nPETERSON YOUNG PUTRA \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES \n1501 FOURTH AVENUE. SUITE 2aoo \nAND DECLARATORY RELIEF - 5  SEATTLE. WASHINGTON 98101_1609 \nPHONE: (206)624.saDO \nFAX; (206)&62-1415 \n\nI  insisted  that her restraints  be removed  before  he  would perform  the  surgery.  Once  the \n2  surgery was completed and the baby was delivered, a DOC agent shackled Ms. Brawley to \n3  the bed once again by the metal leg restraint. \n4  3.11  Ms. Brawley remained in the hospital for an additional three days, to recover \n5  from her c-section surgery and to undergo antibiotic treatment for the infection in her uterus. \n6  During her entire hospitalization - even though walking is extremely difficult in the first few \n7  days after a caesarean section - Ms. Brawley was kept shackled to a hospital  bed by the \n8  metal leg restraint and guarded by a DOC corrections officer 24 hours per day.  Her baby, a \n9  boy, was also treated with antibiotics in the neo-natal intensive care unit for seven days.  Ms. \n10  Brawley was able to see him periodically.  When she needed to hold her baby or respond to \n11  his cries, she had to request that the DOC corrections officer release her restraints.  If she \n12  needed to use the bathroom or take slow walks as was recommended by her physician for \n13  appropriate recovery from a caesarean section, DOC agents shackled her ankles together by \n14  an ankle chain.  Other than those brief periods, DOC officers kept her shackled to a hospital \n15  bed throughout her hospital stay. \n16  3.12  Ms. Brawley was released from the WCCW on May 10,2007.  She currently \n17  lives with her son, his father, and their new baby born in November of2008. \n18  3.13  Washington State Department of Corrections policy states: \"a female offender \n19  shall not be restrained during labor or delivery of an infant.\" [ \n20  3.14  This policy is in apparent recognition that is it dangerous and unnecessary to \n21  shackle  laboring  incarcerated  women.  The  American  College  of  Obstetricians  and \n22  Gynecologists  (ACOG)  is  the  foremost  national  professional  association  for  physicians \n23  practicing obstetrical care.

Dkt. 1.\n27\nA. FACTS\n28\nIn 2004, Plaintiff was sent to the Washington State Corrections Center for Women (“WCCW”) to\nORDER\nPage - 1\n\nCase 3:09-cv-05382-RJB     Document 48      Filed 05/03/2010     Page 2 of 16\n1 serve an approximately year long sentence after a possession of stolen property conviction.  Dkt. 28, at 2. \n2 She was released early for good time served.  Dkt. 28, at 2.  Plaintiff has never been convicted of a violent\n3 crime.  Dkt. 28, at 2.  Plaintiff has seven total felony convictions, including one from 2006 for second\n4 degree theft.  Dkts. 28, at 2 and 30-2, at 11.  Plaintiff was sent back to the WCCW in December of 2006\n5 to serve fourteen months on the second degree theft conviction.  Dkt. 28, at 2.  Plaintiff was five months\n6 pregnant, having a due date of April 16, 2007.  Dkt. 28, at 2 and 3.  When she began her 2006 sentence,\n7 she had two outstanding warrants for felonies in two other counties.  Dkt. 28, at 2. When she began her\n8 sentence she was classified as “medium security.”  Dkt. 28, at 2.  Kevin Mauss, a Correctional Program\n9 Manager at the WCCW, states that Plaintiff was classified as “medium security” because of the two\n10 outstanding warrants, and because she had an incident of failing to report while on community\n11 supervision, and so was placed on “escape status” then.  Dkt. 25, at 3.\n12 Plaintiff states that anytime she was transported from WCCW for prenatal care, she was placed in\n13 full restraints.  Dkt. 28, at 2.  She states that “full restraints” meant that she had a metal chain around her\n14 waist, her hands were handcuffed together, and the handcuffs were attached to the waist chain.  Dkt. 28,\n15 at 2.  She asserts that the chains were humiliating and uncomfortable.  Dkt. 28, at 2.         \n16 On April 13, 2007, Plaintiff states that she woke up around 4:00 a.m. and noticed that she was\n17 leaking fluid.  Dkt. 28, at 3.  She states that this was her first baby and she did not know what to expect. \n18 Dkt. 28, at 3.  Plaintiff states that she went to the officer on duty, who called the clinic, and they\n19 eventually decided to send her back to bed.  Dkt. 28, at 3.  She reported another “gush of water” at 8:00\n20 a.m., went to the medical clinic, and they decided to send her to St. Joseph Hospital in Tacoma,\n21 Washington.  Dkt. 28, at 3-4.

She was examined by medical personnel who determined that she had not ruptured her\n24 membranes and was not in labor.  Dkts. 28, at 4, and 30-2, at 45.  Plaintiff was returned to the WCCW in\n25 full restraints.  Dkt. 28, at 4. \n26 Plaintiff reported continued leaking and so spent the night in the WCCW’s clinic.  Dkts. 28, at 4\n27 and 30-2, at 25.  Treatment notes from L.K. Wilts, R.N., indicate that Plaintiff denied having any\n28 contractions.  Dkt. 30-2, at 25.  Nurse Wilts suspected “Braxton Hicks contractions.”  Dkt. 30-2, at 25. \nORDER\nPage - 2\n\nCase 3:09-cv-05382-RJB     Document 48      Filed 05/03/2010     Page 3 of 16\n1 She was returned to her unit on April 14, 2007.  Dkt. 30-2, at 25.\n2 The next day, April 15, 2007, around 6:00 p.m., Plaintiff returned to the WCCW’s clinic and\n3 reported having contractions four to five minutes apart.  Dkt. 30-2, at 25.  Nurse Melissa Morgan noted on\n4 the fetal monitor that Plaintiff’s contractions were three minutes apart and lasting 30 seconds.  Dkts. 30-2,\n5 at 25, and 30-3, at 6.  Plaintiff reported that she was in a lot of pain from the contractions.  Dkt. 28, at 5. \n6 She reports contractions in her abdomen and lower back.  Dkt. 28, at 5.  Nurse Morgan stated that she\n7 filled out a transfer form to tell the shift office and transporting officers that Plaintiff need to be taken to\n8 the hospital because nurse Morgan thought that Plaintiff was in labor.  Dkt. 30-3, at 6.  The Incident\n9 Report states that Plaintiff was to be transported to the hospital “due to the possibility of active labor.” \n10 Dkt. 30-3, at 37.  The report states that Officers Byrdee Glasco and Herbert Joy, the remaining\n11 Defendants here, “will transport via a state vehicle and have been advised of this situation.”  Dkt. 30-3, at\n12 37.\n13 Plaintiff states that she was strip-searched, put on the orange jumpsuit, and placed in full\n14 restraints.  Dkt. 28, at 5.  Officer Glasco, a mother herself, testified that she was aware that DOC policy at\n15 the time stated that offenders would not be restrained during labor and delivery, but that the policy did not\n16 say they would not be restrained during transportation.  Dkt. 30-3, at 14.  Officer Glasco acknowledges\n17 that it was contrary to DOC policy to use waist chains while transporting women in the third trimester of\n18 pregnancy.  Dkt. 30-3, at 14.  Officer Glasco states that when her supervisor told her she was transporting\n19 Plaintiff, she was not told Plaintiff posed any risk of harm or escape.  Dkt. 30-3, at 15.  Officer Glasco\n20 denies Plaintiff was put in a waist restraint, and maintains that Plaintiff was only handcuffed in the front. \n21 Dkt. 30-3, at 15.  Officer Glasco states that the clinic nursing staff, she can’t remember who, told her that\n22 Plaintiff was full term, had a fever, did not feel well, and needed to be seen at St. Joseph’s hospital.  Dkt.\n23 30-3, at 16.  Officer Glasco denies ever being told that Plaintiff was having contractions and that the\n24 contractions were coming at regular intervals.  Dkt. 30-3, at 16.  Officer Glasco states that she asked\n25 Plaintiff if her water broke, and Plaintiff stated that she did not think so.  Dkt. 30-3, at 16.  Officer Glasco\n26 states that she asked Plaintiff if she was having contractions and Plaintiff denied having any contractions. \n27 Dkt. 30-3, at 16.  Officer Glasco testified that she felt that if an inmate was in active labor, it was not\n28 appropriate to restrain the inmate.  Dkt. 23-3 at 19.  Officer Joy was armed with a gun.  Dkt. 30-3, at 30.    \nORDER\nPage - 3\n\nCase 3:09-cv-05382-RJB     Document 48      Filed 05/03/2010     Page 4 of 16\n1\n2 On the way to the hospital the evening of April 15, 2007, Officer Joy drove the car, Officer Glasco\n3 sat in the front, and Plaintiff sat in the back.  Dkt. 30-3, at 17.  Plaintiff states that while on the drive to St.\n4 Joseph’s hospital, Defendant Officer Glasco was timing her contractions with a watch.  Dkts. 28, at 6, 30-\n5 2, at 4.  Plaintiff states that during this 20 or so minute drive, the contractions were about two minutes\n6 apart.  Dkt. 28, at 6.  Officer Glasco contradicts Plaintiffs assertions, testifying that during the drive she\n7 repeatedly asked Plaintiff whether she was having contractions, and Plaintiff denied them, just saying that\n8 she did not feel good, that she was in pain.  Dkt. 30-3, at 18.\n9 When they arrived at the hospital, around 7:00-7:30 p.m., the officers put Plaintiff into a\n10 wheelchair.  Dkt. 28, at 6 and 30-2, at 5.  Officer Joy states that he remembers one of the nurses being\n11 upset that there was a male officer escorting a woman who was “obviously in labor.”  Dkt. 30-3, at 32-33. \n12 Officer Joy states that he told the nurse “deal with it, because [he’s] not going anywhere.”  Dkt. 30-3, at\n13 33.  Officer Joy states that he stayed outside the room when Plaintiff had vaginal examinations.  Dkt. 30-\n14 3, at 33.  Officer Joy stated that he stayed on the other side of a privacy curtain.  Dkt. 30-3, at 33. Plaintiff\n15 states that once they got into an examination room, the officers took the waist chain and handcuffs off,\n16 and chained her ankle to the bed.  Dkt. 28, at 6.  Plaintiff was put in a hospital gown and a fetal monitor\n17 was attached to her abdomen.  Dkt. 30-3, at 19.  Plaintiff reports very painful contractions at this point. \n18 Dkt. 28 at 6.  She states that the chain attaching her ankle to the bed gave her “enough room to turn from\n19 side to side a little bit, but not fully.”  Dkt. 28, at 6.  She could not get up and stand or walk.  Dkt. 28, at 6. \n20 She reports being unable to get in any other position that would help relieve the pain.  Dkt. 28, at 6. \n21 Plaintiff reports feeling panicked when she was told that the hospital staff was thinking of sending her\n22 back to WCCW because her labor was not progressing.  Dkt. 28, at 6.  Plaintiff asked them to please not\n23 send her back.  Dkt. 28, at 6.  Officer Glasco states that she has had children herself and has been around\n24 several other women who were having contractions.  Dkt. 30-3, at 20.  Officer Glasco states that she was\n25 in the room with Plaintiff the whole four hours prior to her admission, and Plaintiff did not seem to be\n26 having contractions.  Dkt. 30-3, at 20.\n27 Around 11:00 p.m., Plaintiff was admitted to the hospital.  Dkt. 30-2, at 35.  Her admission form\n28 indicates that she was having contractions and vaginal spotting.  Dkt. 30-2, at 35.  Her temperature was\nORDER\nPage - 4\n\nCase 3:09-cv-05382-RJB     Document 48      Filed 05/03/2010     Page 5 of 16\n1 “99+,” and her son’s heart rate was 170 beats per minute, leading to the impression that he had fetal\n2 tachycardia.  Dkt. 30-2, at 35.  Officer Glasco states that as soon as Plaintiff was admitted, Officer Joy\n3 left.  Dkt. 30-3, at 21.  Officer Glasco states that she doesn’t think that she was told that Plaintiff was\n4 being admitted for delivery of the baby.  Dkt. 30-3, at 21.  She states that she recalls the hospital staff\n5 saying that she needed to be admitted because of the “fever and the condition of the child . . . something is\n6 going on . . . it could be an infection.”  Dkt. 30-3, at 21.  Plaintiff states that once admitted, an IV was\n7 inserted and she was moved into a birthing room.  Dkt. 28, at 7.  She states that Officer Glasco chained\n8 her to a wheelchair to move her and then chained her to the bed in the birthing room.  Dkt. 28, at 7. \n9 Plaintiff reports “intense, hard labor pains” at this point.  Dkt. 28, at 7.  Plaintiff states that the chain made\n10 it hard to move in bed, and she could not get up and move around.  Dkt. 28, at 7.  Sometime before 11:45\n11 p.m., Plaintiff was given an epidural.  Dkts. 28, at 7 and 30-2, at 37.  She was unchained long enough for\n12 medical staff to insert the epidural, and then re-chained to the bed.  Dkt. 28, at 7.  Officer Glasco reports\n13 that she understood at that point the epidural was given for pain and so Plaintiff could attempt a vaginal\n14 delivery.  Dkt. 30-3, at 22.  Hospital treatment notes indicate that Plaintiff was comfortable on the\n15 epidural.  Dkt. 30-2, at 37.  She reports that within minutes of having the epidural, her temperature\n16 “suddenly went up and the baby’s heartbeat was way too high.”  Dkt. 28, at 7.  She reports that the nurses\n17 tried putting cold towels on her and giving her Tylenol, but it did not help.  Dkt. 28, at 7.  She states that\n18 they tried to break her membranes, and discovered that she had no amniotic fluid left.  Dkt. 28, at 7.  She\n19 was given oxygen.  Dkts. 28, at 7 and 30-2, at 37.\n20 At around 1:30 a.m. on April 16, 2007, Plaintiff consented to an emergency cesarean.  Dkt. 30-2,\n21 at 37. Plaintiff’s leg restraint was removed just prior to surgery.  Dkts. 28, at 7, and 30-3, at 23.  Around\n22 2:30 a.m., Plaintiff’s son was born.  Dkt. 30-2, at 38.  Carol Sarner, M.D. performed the surgery and her\n23 diagnosis was “term intrauterine pregnancy, chorioamnionitis, fetal tachycardia, failure to dilate,\n24 prolonged rupture of membranes.”  Dkt. 30-2, at 38.  Plaintiff’s son was immediately taken to the\n25 neonatal intensive care unit (“NICU”) to receive antibiotics.  Dkt. 28, at 8.  Plaintiff reports that right\n26 after surgery, before she could even feel her legs, Officer Glasco chained her to the bed again.  Dkt. 28, at\n27 8.  Officer Glasco states that she chained Plaintiff to the bed in the postrecovery room after the nurses\n28 “cleared her for restraining.”  Dkt. 30-3, at 23.\nORDER\nPage - 5\n\nCase 3:09-cv-05382-RJB     Document 48      Filed 05/03/2010     Page 6 of 16\n1 A few hours later, Plaintiff was brought in a wheelchair to the NICU to see her son.  Dkt. 28, at 8. \n2 She reports being chained to the wheelchair.  Dkt. 28, at 8.  She states that she could walk only one or two\n3 steps at this point.  Dkt. 28, at 8.\n4 Plaintiff states that after 24 hours in the NICU, her son was allowed to move into her room.  Dkt.\n5 28, at 8.  He was taken to the NICU every four hours for more medicine.  Dkt. 28, at 8.  Plaintiff was \n6 chained to the bed.  Dkt. 28, at 8.  She states that once her son was returned from the NICU, after\n7 receiving his medicine, out of her reach.  Dkt. 28, at 8.  Plaintiff states that the baby made a noise like he\n8 was choking or was vomiting, so she called for help.  Dkts. 28, at 8 and 30-2, at 10.  Plaintiff states that\n9 she pulled and pulled herself against the chains, but could not reach him.  Dkts. 28, at 8, and 30-2, at 10. \n10 She reports being in pain and being “terrified.”  Dkt. 28, at 9.  Plaintiff states that she had difficulty doing\n11 the walking the nurses wanted her to do after her surgery because of the leg restraints Defendants forced\n12 her to wear.  Dkt. 28, at 9.\n13 Plaintiff was discharged from the hospital on April 19, 2007.  Dkt. 30-2, at 43.  Plaintiff was\n14 released from WCCW on May 10, 2007.  Dkt. 30-2, at 10.    \n15 The Washington State Department of Corrections’ policy in place at the time, Restricted Policy\n16 420.250, provides:  “[a] female offender will not be restrained during labor and delivery of an infant.” \n17 Dkt. 39, at 10.\n18 B. PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n19 On June 25, 2009, Plaintiff filed this case.  Dkt. 1.  She makes a claim for violation of her right to\n20 be free from cruel and unusual punishment under both the Eighth Amendment to the United States\n21 Constitution (via 42 U.S.C. § 1983) and Article 1, Section 14 of the Washington State Constitution.  Id.\n22 She seeks declaratory relief that the Defendants violated her rights under both the federal and state\n23 constitution. Id.  She also seeks damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs.  Id.\n24 Parties have now filed cross motions for summary judgment.  Dkts. 34 and 27.  Defendants seek\n25 summary dismissal of Plaintiff’s claims.  Dkt. 34.  Plaintiff seeks partial summary judgment on her Eighth\n26 Amendment claim against Officer Glasco.  Dkt. 27.  Some of the issues raised in these motions are now\n27 resolved (see the discussion in the next section).  The outstanding issues are summarized in Section I. D.\n28 below.\nORDER\nPage - 6\n\nCase 3:09-cv-05382-RJB     Document 48      Filed 05/03/2010     Page 7 of 16\n1 C. RESOLVED ISSUES\n2 With the exception of Officers Glasco and Joy, all individually named Defendants have been\n3 dismissed by stipulation.  Dkts. 16, 18, and 38.  To the extent that Defendants’ motion for summary\n4 judgment seeks dismissal of these dismissed parties, it should be denied as moot.  Further, Plaintiff states\n5 in her response to Defendants’ motion for summary judgment, that she will not pursue her claim for\n6 declaratory relief under either federal or Washington law.  Dkt. 42, at 2.  To the extent that Defendants\n7 seek dismissal of these claims in their motion for summary judgment, the motion should be granted and\n8 those claims dismissed.  Plaintiff does not dispute that monetary damages are not available here against\n9 the Defendant State of Washington and its agency, the Department of Corrections, pursuant to the\n10 Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution.  Pittman v. Oregon Employment Dept., 509 F.3d\n11 1065, 1071 (9th Cir. 2007) (internal quotations omitted)(as the Supreme Court has applied the Eleventh\n12 Amendment, an unconsenting State is immune from suits brought in federal courts by her own citizens as\n13 well as by citizens of another State absent certain exceptions).  Defendants’ motion seeking dismissal of\n14 the damages claims against Washington and the Department of Corrections should be granted.    \n15 D. SUMMARY OF REMAINING ISSUES\n16 Plaintiff states that her remaining claims are that Officers Glasco and Joy “violated her Eighth\n17 Amendment right to be free of cruel and unusual punishment when they shackled her during labor and\n18 immediately postpartum on April 15 and 16, 2007.”  Dkt. 42.   \n19 Defendants move for dismissal of Plaintiff’s remaining claim, arguing that Plaintiff did not suffer\n20 any constitutional infringement, even if she did, her rights were not clearly established and so Officers\n21 Glasco and Joy are entitled to qualified immunity.  Dkts. 34, and 44.  Defendants also argue that her\n22 claims should be dismissed because Plaintiff failed to exhaust her remedies under the Prison Litigation\n23 Reform Act (“PLRA”) and the doctrine of laches bars Plaintiff’s claims.  Id.\n24 Plaintiff moves for summary judgment against Officer Glasco, arguing that shackling her during\n25 labor and immediately postpartum violated her Eighth Amendment rights, and those rights were clearly\n26 established at the time.  Dkts. 27 and 42.  Plaintiff argues that because she was out of prison when she\n27 filed her complaint, she did not need to exhaust under the PLRA.  Dkt. 42, at 5 (citing Talamantes v.\n28 Leyva, 575 F.3d 1021, 1023 (9th Cir. 2009)).  Plaintiff argues that Defendants failed to plead laches in\nORDER\nPage - 7\n\nCase 3:09-cv-05382-RJB     Document 48      Filed 05/03/2010     Page 8 of 16\n1 their answer, thereby waiving the defense.  Dkt. 42, at 6.  Plaintiff argues that even if Defendants did not\n2 waive the defense, Plaintiff filed her case within the statute of limitations and there is no basis to shorten\n3 the time allowed by law to file her claim.  Dkt. 42, at 6.\n4 Defendants move to strike Exhibits 3 and Exhibits 20-24 to the Declaration of Michael Wampold. \n5 Dkt. 44.  Defendants move to strike any evidence related to actions or activities after 6:00 a.m. on April\n6 16, 2007.  Dkt. 44.  Defendants move to strike the unsupported “opinions” of Dr. Thomas Easterling. \n7 Dkt. 44.  Defendants also move to strike exhibits 2 and 3 of Plaintiff’s Opposition to Defendants’ motion\n8 (Dkt. 43, at 7-36).  Dkt. 46.\n9 This opinion will first address the motion to strike, then the issues of PLRA exhaustion and laches. \n10 This opinion will lastly address the core issue of qualified immunity.  \n11 II. DISCUSSION\n12 A. MOTION TO STRIKE\n13 Defendants’ motion to strike (Dkt. 44) should be denied, in part, and granted, in part.\n14 Defendants move to strike Exhibit 3 to the Declaration of Michael Wampold.  Dkt. 44.  Exhibit 3 purports\n15 to be a “custody review” sheets.  Dkt. 30-2, at 20.  These pleadings (Dkt. 30-2, at 20-22) should be\n16 stricken as no foundation has been laid for the document’s authenticity.  Fed. R. Ev. 602.  \n17 Defendants’ motion to strike Exhibit 20 to the Declaration of Michael Wampold should be\n18 granted.  Exhibit 20 is a June 2007 letter from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologist\n19 stating it opposes shackling inmates in labor.  Dkt. 30-4, at 16.  Consideration of that document was not\n20 necessary to decide these motions.    \n21 Defendants’ motion to strike Exhibit 21-24 to the Declaration of Michael Wampold should be\n22 granted.  These pleadings are articles from various sources opposing shackling inmates in labor.  They\n23 also are unnecessary and are of limited relevance.         \n24 Defendants’ motion to strike any evidence related to actions or activities after 6:00 a.m. on April\n25 16, 2007, should be denied to the extent that this evidence provides background facts.  Dkt. 44.\n26 For the purposes of this motion alone, Defendants motion to strike the opinions of Dr. Thomas\n27 Easterling should be denied.  Dkt. 44.  Some of Defendants’ discussion of his opinion was well taken, but\n28 that evidence was not necessary to decide this motion.    \nORDER\nPage - 8\n\nCase 3:09-cv-05382-RJB     Document 48      Filed 05/03/2010     Page 9 of 16\n1 Defendants’ motion to strike ( Dkt. 46) should be granted.  Exhibits 2 and 3 of Plaintiff’s\n2 Opposition to Defendants’ motion, (Dkt. 43, at 7-36), complaints purportedly filed in U.S. District Court\n3 for the Northern District of Illinois and  U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee.  These\n4 pleadings are of limited relevance and were not considered.   \n5 B. PLRA EXHAUSTION and LACHES\n6 1. PLRA\n7 A person not incarcerated or detained at the time an action is filed is not a “prisoner” for purposes\n8 of the PLRA, and therefore, not subject to the exhaustion requirement.  Talamantes v. Leyva, 575 F.3d\n9 1021, 1023 (9th Cir. 2009).  It is undisputed that Plaintiff was not “incarcerated or detained” at the time\n10 the Complaint was filed.  Defendants’ motion to summarily dismiss Plaintiff’s claims based on Plaintiff’s\n11 failure to exhaust her administrative remedies under the PLRA should be denied.    \n12 2. Laches\n13 “The doctrine of laches is a creature of equity and is grounded upon the principles of equitable\n14 estoppel.” Rutter v. Rutter's Estate, 59 Wash.2d 781, 784 (1962).  Laches does not bar an action short of\n15 the applicable statute of limitations “unless it is made to appear that, by reason of the delay in asserting a\n16 claim, the other party has altered his position or has been otherwise injured by the delay.”  Id.\n17 To the extent Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiff’s claims for declaratory relief through the\n18 doctrine of laches, this opinion has already held that those claims should be dismissed and so the motion\n19 is moot.  To the extent that Defendants use the doctrine to defend against her other claims, the motion\n20 should be denied.  It is undisputed that Plaintiff filed this action within the applicable statute of\n21 limitations.  Defendants make no showing that by reason of the delay Plaintiff has altered their position. \n22 Defendants make no showing that they have been “otherwise injured by the delay.”  Defendants motion to\n23 summarily dismiss Plaintiff’s claims on the doctrine of laches should be denied.\n24 3. Conclusion\n25 Plaintiff was not required to exhaust her administrative remedies under the PLRA.  The doctrine\n26 of laches does not bar Plaintiff’s claim for damages, attorney’s fees, and costs.  This opinion will now\n27 turn to the core of the case, whether the officers here are entitled to summary judgment on their qualified\n28 immunity defense.  \nORDER\nPage - 9\n\nCase 3:09-cv-05382-RJB     Document 48      Filed 05/03/2010     Page 10 of 16\n1 C. SUMMARY JUDGMENT - STANDARD\n2 Summary judgment is proper only if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and\n3 admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any\n4 material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  The\n5 moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law when the nonmoving party fails to make a\n6 sufficient showing on an essential element of a claim in the case on which the nonmoving party has the\n7 burden of proof. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1985).  There is no genuine issue of fact for\n8 trial where the record, taken as a whole, could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non moving\n9 party. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586 (1986) (nonmoving party\n10 must present specific, significant probative evidence, not simply “some metaphysical doubt.”); See also\n11 Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).  Conversely, a genuine dispute over a material fact exists if there is sufficient\n12 evidence supporting the claimed factual dispute, requiring a judge or jury to resolve the differing versions\n13 of the truth. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 253 (1986); T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Pac.\n14 Elec. Contractors Ass’n, 809 F.2d 626, 630 (9th Cir. 1987).\n15 The determination of the existence of a material fact is often a close question.  The court must\n16 consider the substantive evidentiary burden that the nonmoving party must meet at trial – e.g., a\n17 preponderance of the evidence in most civil cases.  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 254; T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc., 809\n18 F.2d at 630.  The court must resolve any factual issues of controversy in favor of the nonmoving party\n19 only when the facts specifically attested by that party contradict facts specifically attested by the moving\n20 party.  The nonmoving party may not merely state that it will discredit the moving party’s evidence at\n21 trial, in the hopes that evidence can be developed at trial to support the claim.  T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc., 809\n22 F.2d at 630 (relying on Anderson, supra). Conclusory, non specific statements in affidavits are not\n23 sufficient, and missing facts will not be presumed.  Lujan v. Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, 497 U.S. 871, 888-89\n24 (1990).\n25 D. QUALIFIED IMMUNITY\n26 “[G]overnment officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability\n27 for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional\n28 rights of which a reasonable person would have known.” Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818\nORDER\nPage - 10\n\nCase 3:09-cv-05382-RJB     Document 48      Filed 05/03/2010     Page 11 of 16\n1 (1982).  “Through application of the qualified immunity doctrine, public servants avoid the general costs\n2 of subjecting officials to the costs of trial - distraction of officials from their governmental duties,\n3 inhibition of discretionary action, and deterrence of able people from public service.”  V-1 Oil Co. v.\n4 Smith, 114 F.3d 854, 857 (9th Cir. 1997)(internal citations omitted).   The immunity is “immunity from\n5 suit rather than a mere defense to liability.”  Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526 (1985).\n6 The Supreme Court established a two-part analysis in Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001),\n7 for determining whether qualified immunity is appropriate in a suit against a public official for an alleged\n8 violation of a constitutional right.  Boyd v. Benton County, 374 F.3d 773, 778 (9th Cir. 2004), citing\n9 Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001).  Although no longer mandatory, the Supreme Court has\n10 recently held that it may be “beneficial” for a court required to rule upon qualified immunity to examine\n11 the Saucier factors:  (1) whether the official violated the plaintiff's constitutional rights on the facts\n12 alleged and (2) if there was a violation, whether the constitutional rights were clearly established. \n13 Pearson v. Callahan, 129 S.Ct. 808, (2009) (holding that the Saucier two-part analysis was no longer\n14 mandatory).  Application of the factors is beneficial here, so this opinion will first turn to whether\n15 Plaintiff’s Eighth Amendment rights were violated, and then if they were violated, whether they were\n16 clearly established in April of 2007.\n17 1. Violation of Constitutional Rights?\n18 The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the use of “cruel and unusual\n19 punishment.”  The Eighth Amendment is applied to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment.  Wilson v.\n20 Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 296-97(1991).  The “unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain constitutes cruel and\n21 unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth Amendment.”  Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 737\n22 (2002)(some internal quotation marks omitted). “Among unnecessary and wanton inflictions of pain are\n23 those that are totally without penological justification.” Id. (internal citations omitted).  In making this\n24 determination in the context of prison conditions, the court must “ascertain whether the officials involved\n25 acted with ‘deliberate indifference’ to the inmates’ health or safety.”  Id., at 738 (internal citations\n26 omitted).\n27 The Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment also imposes duties on\n28 prison officials, “who must provide humane conditions of confinement; prison officials must ensure that\nORDER\nPage - 11\n\nCase 3:09-cv-05382-RJB     Document 48      Filed 05/03/2010     Page 12 of 16\n1 inmates receive adequate food, clothing, shelter, and medical care, and must take reasonable measures to\n2 guarantee the safety of the inmates.”  Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 833 (1994)(internal citations\n3 omitted).  “Deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners” constitutes a violation of the\n4 Eighth Amendment.  Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104 (1976).\n5 There is no Ninth Circuit case addressing whether the shackling of inmates during labor and\n6 delivery of infants violates the Eighth Amendment.  Plaintiff here argues that she is making a essentially a\n7 “hybrid” claim.  Dkt. 27, at 19.  She states:\n8 One aspect of her serious medical need - to deliver her baby - was met by prison officials,\nwho took her to the hospital (eventually) for assistance with childbirth.  Yet, in shackling\n9 Ms. Brawley throughout labor, corrections officers interfered with her serious medical\nneeds by putting her health and her pregnancy risk.  The presence of the shackles also\n10 inflicted both physical and psychological pain.  While either serves as an independent\nbasis for finding a sufficiently serious deprivation, their coexistence is significant because\n11 that is precisely what renders the shackling of laboring women so obviously inhumane.\n12 Dkt. 27, at 19.\n13 There are two parts in the test that the Ninth Circuit uses to determine “deliberate indifference” in\n14 the context of cases alleging a failure to treat a serous medical need.  Jett v. Penner, 439 F.3d 1091, 1096\n15 (9th Cir. 2006). “First, the plaintiff must show a serious medical need,” and “[s]econd, the plaintiff must\n16 show the defendant’s response to the need was deliberately indifferent.” Id. (internal citations omitted).\n17 a. Substantial Risk to Health or Safety, or Serious Medical Need\n18 At the first step here then, the question under the Eighth Amendment is whether prison officials\n19 exposed Plaintiff to a sufficiently substantial “risk of serious damage” to her future health, Farmer v.\n20 Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 842-843 (1994)(internal citation omitted), and/or whether she had a serious\n21 medical need,” Jett, 1096.  The first step is judged from an objective point of view.     \n22 There is sufficient evidence in the record to conclude that Plaintiff endured unnecessary pain, was\n23 exposed to a sufficiently serious risk of harm, and had a serious medical need when she was shackled to\n24 the hospital bed on April 15, 2010 and April 16, 2010.  Common sense, and the DOC’s own policy, tells\n25 us that it is not good practice to shackle women to a hospital bed while they are in labor.  Defendants\n26 acknowledge that there are issues of fact as to whether Plaintiff was in labor.  Dkt. 44.  The record,\n27 viewed in a light most favorable to Plaintiff, indicates that she was experiencing strong contractions,\n28 some that she felt in her back, as early as when she presented to the WCCW clinic at 6:00 p.m. on April\nORDER\nPage - 12\n\nCase 3:09-cv-05382-RJB     Document 48      Filed 05/03/2010     Page 13 of 16\n1 15, 2007.  Dkts. 30-2, at 25, 30-3, at 6, and 28, at 5.  There is evidence in the record that she continued to\n2 have more and more painful contractions until she received her epidural in the hospital several hours later. \n3 Dkts. 28-7, at 6; 30-2, at 35.\n4 There is evidence in the record that Plaintiff endured unnecessary pain due to being chained to her\n5 bed.  Thomas R. Easterling, M.D. testified on behalf of Plaintiff.  Dkt. 30-3, at 25.  Dr. Easterling is a\n6 board certified obstetrician-gynecologist.  Dkt. 29, at 1. Dr. Easterling testified that “[t]he ability to move\n7 and change positions is integral to a woman trying to cope with pain, and so [Plaintiff’s] ability to deal\n8 with pain by changing positions is severely impaired.”  Dkt. 30-3, at 26.  \n9 Further, there is evidence that Plaintiff was exposed to a sufficiently serious risk of harm and had\n10 a serious medical need - being in labor - when she was shackled on April 15 and 16, 2007.  Dr. Easterling\n11 testified that it is important for women who are in labor to be able to move around to avoid venocaval\n12 occlusion, hypertension, and fetal compromise.  Dkt. 30-3, at 26.  Defendants offer no evidence to counter\n13 this opinion.\n14 Moreover, there is no evidence in the record which indicated that shackling Plaintiff was justified\n15 by any legitimate penological concern.  There is no evidence that Plaintiff was dangerous to herself or\n16 others.  There is no evidence that she posed a flight risk.  The evidence shows that on April 15, 2007,\n17 when Officers Glasco and Joy took her to the hospital, at a minium, she was a pregnant woman at or near\n18 full term, was running a fever, was in pain, and was moving slowly.  Dkt. 23-3, at 43-45.  \n19 Plaintiff has shown that there is sufficient evidence in the record, from an objective standpoint,\n20 that she had a serious medical need and was exposed to an unnecessary risk of harm.  The inquiry does\n21 not end here, however.  To prevail on her motion, Plaintiff must show that Officer Glasco was\n22 deliberately indifferent to that need or risk of harm.  Jett, at 1096.\n23 b. Deliberate Indifference \n24 The “second prong-defendant's response to the need was deliberately indifferent-is satisfied by\n25 showing (a) a purposeful act or failure to respond to a prisoner's pain or possible medical need and (b)\n26 harm caused by the indifference.”  Jett, at 1096. (internal citations omitted).  “Under this standard, the\n27 prison official must not only be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial\n28 risk of serious harm exists, but that person must also draw the inference.”  Toguchi v. Chung, 391 F.3d\nORDER\nPage - 13\n\nCase 3:09-cv-05382-RJB     Document 48      Filed 05/03/2010     Page 14 of 16\n1 1051, (9th Cir. 2004).  Existence of this subjective state of mind may be inferred from the fact that the\n2 risk of harm is obvious.  Hope, at 738. \n3 Although they testify that they know that it was against DOC policy to shackle a woman in labor,\n4 there are issues of fact as to whether Officers Glasco and Joy were aware that Plaintiff was in labor when\n5 they took her to the hospital on April 15, 2007, and when Officer Glasco remained with her there until the\n6 birth of Plaintiff’s son.  Officer Glasco denied that she was told that Plaintiff was having contractions. \n7 Dkt. 30-3, at 16.  She testified that when she asked Plaintiff, Plaintiff denied having contractions on the\n8 ride to the hospital.  Dkt. 30-3, at 16.  Officer Glasco testified that in the four hours prior to Plaintiff’s\n9 admission to the hospital, while in the examination room, Plaintiff did not seem to be having contractions. \n10 Dkt. 30-3, at 20.  Although it strains the imagination, Officer Glasco maintains that she did not think\n11 Plaintiff was in labor even after the hospital staff gave Plaintiff an epidural which Officer Glasco\n12 acknowledges she knew was for pain and so Plaintiff could attempt a vaginal birth.  These are the kinds of\n13 credibility decisions left to the fact finder.  There are issues of fact as to whether Officers Glasco and Joy\n14 were deliberately indifferent to the risks of harm to Plaintiff and her serious medical needs when they\n15 shackled her.  Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment on the liability of Officer Glasco, then must be\n16 denied at this stage.  (Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment did not address the liability of Officer\n17 Joy.)\n18 The inquiry does not end here, however, regarding Defendants’ motion for summary judgment. \n19 The next question that must be determined is:  even if Plaintiff is able to show that her constitutional\n20 rights were violated, in order to overcome Defendants’ motion for summary judgment on qualified\n21 immunity, Plaintiff must show that her rights were clearly established at the time.  \n22 2. Constitutional Rights Clearly Established?\n23 In analyzing the second part of the Saucier test, the issue is “whether the plaintiff’s constitutional\n24 right was clearly established at the time of the injury.”  Boyd at 780.  “For a constitutional right to be\n25 clearly established, its contours must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that\n26 what he is doing violates that right.” Id. at 780-781.  “In other words, an official who makes a reasonable\n27 mistake as to what the law requires under a given set of circumstances is entitled to the immunity\n28 defense.” Id.  The Constitution, decisions of the United States Supreme Court, and decisions of lower\nORDER\nPage - 14\n\nCase 3:09-cv-05382-RJB     Document 48      Filed 05/03/2010     Page 15 of 16\n1 federal courts may provide notice of established constitutional rights.  Hope , at 741-42. \n2 Plaintiff has made a sufficient showing that by April of 2007 shackling inmates while they are in\n3 labor was clearly established as a violation of the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition against cruel and\n4 unusual punishment.  Defendants admit that Washington Department of Correction’s own policy\n5 prohibited it.  Although not binding authority, the Eight Circuit recently held that a female inmate’s\n6 “protections from being shackled during labor had . . . been clearly established by decisions of the\n7 Supreme Court and the lower federal courts before September 2003.”  Nelson v. Correctional Medical\n8 Services, 583 F.3d 522, 533 (8th Cir. 2009).  The Nelson court noted that as early as 1994, a federal\n9 district court in the District of Columbia held that shackling an inmate in labor was a violation of female\n10 prisoner’s constitutional rights. Women Prisoners of D.C. Dept. of Corrections v. District of Columbia,\n11 877 F.Supp. 634 (D.D.C. 1994), modified in part on other grounds, 899 F.Supp. 659 (D.D.C. 1995).  The\n12 Nelson court also reviewed the U.S. Supreme Court holding in Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730 (2002).  In\n13 Hope, the Supreme Court held that under the circumstances presented in the case, handcuffing an inmate\n14 to a hitching post was a violation of the Eighth Amendment.  The Hope court held that the prison officials\n15 had acted with deliberate indifference to Hope’s health and safety in “violation of the Eighth Amendment\n16 by restraining him ‘[d]espite the clear lack of an emergency situation’ in a manner ‘that created a risk of\n17 particular discomfort and humiliation.’” Nelson, at 532 (quoting Hope, at 737-38).  The Nelson court\n18 concluded that the Supreme Court holding in Hope regarding shackling an inmate to a hitching post, and\n19 the holdings from the D.C. district courts was sufficient to show that the right not to be shackled during\n20 labor and delivery of an infant was clearly established.  The Nelson court also examined the Arkansas\n21 Department of Corrections regulations and found that they, too, discouraged the shackling of the inmate\n22 in that case. Id., at 533.  The Nelson court’s reasoning is persuasive.\n23 As in Nelson, a reasonable factfinder could determine from the record in this case that the\n24 Defendants  were not facing an emergency situation but nevertheless “subjected [the Plaintiff] to a\n25 substantial risk of physical harm, to the unnecessary pain caused by the [shackles] and the restricted\n26 position of confinement ... [and] created a risk of particular discomfort and humiliation,” such that\n27 qualified immunity should be denied.  Nelson, at 532.\n28   3. Conclusion on Qualified Immunity\nORDER\nPage - 15\n\nCase 3:09-cv-05382-RJB     Document 48      Filed 05/03/2010     Page 16 of 16\n1 There are issues of fact as to whether Officers Glasco and Joy violated Plaintiff’s Eighth\n2 Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.  Plaintiff’s Motion for Partial Summary\n3 Judgment against Officer Glasco should be denied.  Defendants’ motion for summary dismissal of\n4 Plaintiff’s Eighth Amendment claim on qualified immunity grounds should be denied.  Plaintiff has\n5 shown evidence, if believed, that would demonstrate a violation of her clearly established rights, barring\n6 the qualified immunity defense.          \n7 III.

She was an\n14 exemplary inmate who was never disciplined for any infraction. She was released after less\n15 than seven months, without the need for probation, because her crime was non-violent and\n16 shewas givencredit for good time served.\n17 3.3 In April 2007, Ms. Brawleywas also ninemonths pregnant.\n18 3.4 At 4:00 a.m. on April 13, 2007, Ms. Brawley's amniotic sac ruptured, causing\n19 a slow leak.

The nurse told her to go back to bed and report\n21 to \"sickcall\" inthe morning.\n22 3.5 At \"sick call\" three and a halfhours later, the clinic nurse tested Ms. Brawley\n23 to determine whether she was in labor, and decided to send her to St. Joseph Hospital in\n24 Tacoma, Washington. During her transportation to St. Joseph, DOC agents kept Ms.\n25 Brawley shackled with a chain around her belly (lmown as a \"waist chain\") attached to hand\n26 cuffs.

The DOC agent agreed and\n2 removed the restraints, but chained Ms. Brawley to a hospital bed by a metal chain ankle\n3 restraint, where she remained throughout the examination. After examiningher, the certified\n4 nurse midwife discharged Ms. Brawleywithinstructions to return ifshehad significantwater\n5 leakage, excessive bleeding, or quick contractions. Ms. Brawley was again restrained with\n6 the waistchain andhandcuffs and transportedbackto WCCW.\n7 3.6 Because she continued to experience water leakage and believed she was in\n8 labor, Ms. Brawley returned to the prison clinic on Saturday, April 14,2007, where she was\n9 allowed to stay overnight-at her insistence-for observation. At 3:00 a.m. on April 14,\n10 2007, Ms. Brawley began to have contractions in her lower back and abdomen every eight\n11 minutes. She was told - repeatedly and without explanation that these were the \"wrong\"\n12 kind ofcontractions. Shewas released sevenhours later.\n13 3.7 At 4:00p.m. onApril 15, 2007, Ms. Brawley's contractions were five minutes\n14 apart. Because she feared that her reports ofher labor would be treated dismissively once\n15 again, she waited an hour and a half, then reported her contractions to a corrections officer\n16 and asked to be taken to the clinic. She was taken to the clinic and monitored by clinic\n17 personnel. After being subjected to what she was told was a routine strip search,\n.18 Correctional Officers Glasco and Joy shackled her with a waist chain attached to hand cuffs\n19 and transportedherto the hospital.\n20 3.8 When she arrived at St. Joseph Hospital, Correctional Officers Glasco and Joy\n21 shackledMs. Brawleyto the hospital bedby one leg, using ametal anlde restraint attached to\n22 a metal chain and in direct violation of DOC policy. During this time, Ms. Brawley was\n23 having painful and frequent labor contractions. At some point during her labor, Correctional\n24 OfficerEasonrelieved Correction Officers Glasco and/or Joy. After five hours oflaboring \n25 in shackles the entire time-Ms. Brawley was given an epidural.

She was\n2 given antibiotics, Tylenol and cold compresses, which failed to reduce her temperature.\n3 Eventually she was given oxygen. During this process, Correctional Officer Eason failed to\n4 free Ms. Brawleyofthe leg shacklethatrestrainedherto herhospitalbed.\n5 3.9 A physician then attempted to induce labor by breaking the amniotic sac, but\n6 found the sac empty. Left leaking and untreated for two days, her uterus had become\n7 infected. The fetal heartbeat was dangerously accelerated, as well. During this process,\n8 Correctional OfficerEasonkept Ms. Brawleyshackled to ahospital bed in direct violation of\n9 DOC policy.\n10 3.10 At 1:30 a.m. on April 16, 2007, an on-call physician detennined that a\n11 caesarean section was necessary for the health ofboth mother and child, and Ms. Brawley\n12 consented. It was only then that Correctional Officer Eason and/or other DOC agents freed\n13 her from the restraints, because the physician insisted that her restraints be removed before\n14 shewouldperformthe surgery. ·Oncethe surgerywas completed and the babywas delivered,\n15 Correctional Officer Eason and/or other DOC agents shackled Ms. Brawley to the bed once\n16 againbythe metal legrestraint.\n17 3.11 Ms. Brawley remained in the hospital for an additional three days, to recover\n18 from her c-section surgery and to undergo antibiotic treatment for the infection in her uterus.\n19 During her entire hospitalization- eventhough walking is extremely difficult inthe first few\n20 days after a caesarean section - Correctional Officer Eason and other DOC corrections\n21 officers kept Ms. Brawley shackled to a hospital bed by the metal leg restraint and guarded\n22 her 24 hours per day. Her baby, a boy, was also treated with antibiotics in the neo-natal\n23 intensive careunit for seven days. Ms. Brawleywas able to see him periodically. When she\n24 needed to hold her baby or respond to his cries, she had to request that Correctional Officer\n25 Eason and/or other DOC corrections officers release her restraints.

The American College of Obstetricians and\n10 Gynecologists (ACOG) is the foremost national professional association for physicians\n11 practicing obstetrical care. ACOG states: \"Physical restraints have interferedwith the ability\n12 ofphysicians to safely practice medicine by reducing their ability to assess and evaluate the\n13 physical condition of the mother and the fetus, and have similarly made the labor and\n14 deliveryprocess more difficult thanitneeds to be; thus, overallputtingthe health andlives of\n15 the women and unborn children at risk. .. [t]he practice ofshackling an incarcerated woman\n16 in labor may not only compromise her health care but is demeaning and unnecessary. Most\n17 women incorrectional facilities are incarcerated for non-violent crimes and are accompanied\n18 by guards when they are cared for in medical facilities. Testimonials from incarcerated\n19 women who went through labor with shackles confirm the emotional distress and the\n20 physical pain caused by the restraints. Women describe the inability to move to allay the\n21 pains oflabor, the bruising causedbychainbelts across the abdomen, and the deeply felt loss\n22 ofdignity.,,2\n23\nAmnestyInternational, StatebyState SurveyofPolicies andPractices inthe United States,\n24 1\ncitingWash.
