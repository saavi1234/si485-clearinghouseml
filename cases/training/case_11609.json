INTRODUCTION\nThe evidence at trial conclusively established that the State of Colorado was\nintentionally not providing Medicaid services to hundreds of eligible persons for\nbudgetary reasons. The State Defendants ignore this critical fact in their Answer\nBrief, and attempt to turn this case into a debate over whether Medicaid is a\n\"payment\" scheme or one involving \"services.\"\nThe State Defendants essentially concede that the district court erred below -\noffering token support for the district court's opinion. Instead, the State Defendants\nattempt to fashion an alternative rationale for affirming the result below, an\nalternative rationale which also involves refashioning CACCB's and Plaintiffs'\nclaims.\nTo resolve this case, this Court need only apply well established law and hold\nthe State responsible for what it has agreed to do in its State Medicaid Plan. The\nbudgetary reasons underlying the district court's refusal not only are not a sufficient\ndefense, they have been substantially mitigated by the recent vote approving\nReferendum C. _\n_CCACB asks this Court to take judicial notice of the recent vote in Colorado approving\nReferendum C, which will allow the State of Colorado to retain an estimated $3.1 billion over the\nnext five years that would otherwise have had to be returnedto Colorado taxpayers under Colorado's\n\nII. The State Defendants Concede That the District Court Erred in Relying\nUpon the State's budget Constraints in Refusing to Award Relief to\nPlaintiffs and CACCB\nThe State Defendants do not even attempt to defend the district court's decision\nuntil page 40 of their brief, and then, their defense involves essentially a re-write of\nwhat the district court held. The district court unquestionably dismissed the\nPlaintiffs' and CACCB's claims based upon a misstatement of law that it was wrong\nto make the State of Colorado appropriate additional funds to afford a remedy for the\nState's violation of the Medicaid Act:\nThe level of funding for Medicaid in Colorado is determined by the\nColorado General Assembly. The funds to be spent are those collected\nby taxation and the Colorado electorate has imposed constitutional\nconstraints on the power of the legislature to impose taxes and the\npurposes for which public funds can be spent.\nIn summary, the declaratory relief requested by the plaintiffs and\nIntervenor must be declined because such ajudgment would intrude into\nthe authority and responsibility of those who are accountable to the\nelectorate. There is no more fundamental principle of democratic\ngovernment than that which reserves to the people the power to tax and\nspend, It is therefore\nORDERED, that judgment will enter for the dismissal of the\nplaintiffs' and Intervenor's claims with the defendants' costs to be taxed.\nTaxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR), Colo. Const. art. X, ยง20 See Fed. R. Evid. 201(f) (judicial notice\ncan be taken at any stage of the proceedings).\n\nCACCB's Opening Brief Attachment A at 13, 20. The State Defendants' assert that\nCACCB and Plaintiffs are \"mischaracterizing\" what the district court held, and that\n\"read fairly,\" all the district court did was consider the \"practical ramifications\" of\nany relief it was asked to award. Answer Brief at 40. The State Defendants fail to\nassert, however, how such \"practical ramifications\" of any award can legally afford\na legitimate basis for dismissing CACCB's and Plaintiffs' claims.\nCACCB respectfully submits that the district court's decision speaks for itself.\n\"Read fairly,\" the district court squarely held that the Medicaid claims against the\nState of Colorado must be dismissed because of the State's budgetary constraints.\nThe leading case in this Circuit for the proposition that budgetary constraints\ncannot afford a defense to compliance with the Medicaid Act is Amisub (PSL), Inc.\nv. Colorado Dept. of Social Services, 879 F.2d 789 (10 thCir. 1989), cert. denied, 496\nU.S. 935 (1990). CACCB relied upon Amisub for this proposition, yet, the State\nDefendants failed to mention Amisub in the relevant part of their brief. 2\nThe key evidence at trial proved that hundreds of persons who are eligible for\nresidential services - and who need them today - are being denied them because the\nState is maintaining a waiting list because of then-existing budgetary constraints.\n2 The State Defendants cite Amisub only once, and then for a different\nproposition. See Answer Brief at 35. The part of their brief attempting to recast the\ndistrict court's reliance upon its budget-constraints rationale appears at 40-44.\n\nSee,e.g., App. 1171-73 (Colorado General Assembly Joint Budget Committee briefing\ndocument); App.251 (cross-examination of Colorado Director of Division for\nDevelopmental Disabilities, acknowledging no attempt by State of Colorado in 2004-\n2005 to reduce waiting list because of budgetary constraints). This Court held in\nAmisub that the State of Colorado cannot do this. The State Defendants' wholesale\nfailure to even address this point can only be considered an admission that the district\ncourt erred.\nIII. The Medicaid Act Involves More than a \"Payment Scheme\"\nThe State Defendants principal defense is to rely upon dicta in a Seventh\nCircuit opinion, Bruggeman v. Blagojevich, 324 F.3d 906 (7th Cir. 2003), for the\nproposition that Medicaid is a \"payment scheme,\" and, under it, the State is only\nobligated to pay for services, not provide them. The State Defendants essentially urge\nthis Court to fashion its own rationale to dismiss Plaintiffs' and CACCB' s claims, and\nsuggest that this Court can accomplish the task by adopting the Bruggeman dicta.\nThis Court should decline the State Defendants' invitation for a host of reasons.\nFirst, the State's argument is belied by the plain language of the Medicaid Act\nand Colorado's State Plan implementing the Act in Colorado. Colorado's State Plan\nunequivocally contains the promise from the State of Colorado to the federal\ngovernment that it wil! \"provide\" \"[i]ntermediate care facility services\" with \"no\n\nlimitations.\" App.912.\nThe State Defendants scoff at this language as mere verbiage on a \"preprinted\nform,\" and they assert that \"there is no basis to conclude that the language of the form\noverrides the pertinent statutes and regulations.\" Answer Brief at 19. There are two\nproblems with this tactic. First, it represents an attempt to persuade this Court to\nignore the plain language of the State Plan, a document other federal courts have\nfound binding, _ Wilder v. Va. Hosp. Ass'n, 496 U.S. 498, 502 (1990)(a\nMedicaid state plan \"contains a comprehensive statement describing the nature and\nscope of the State's Medicaid program.); Amisub, 879 F.2d at 794 (discussing\nbinding effect of Boren Amendment as a state-plan requirement); King by King v.\nSullivan, 776 F.Supp. 645,648 (D.R.I. 1991) (\"The character and details of the state's\nobligations arise from the commitments the state makes in its State Plan, which,\nthrough the Medicaid Act and its regulations, binds the state as a matter of federal\nlaw.\").\nSecond, the State of Colorado's ICF/MR \"no limitations\" promise does not\nonly not override the applicable statutes and regulations, iteffectuates them. CACCB\ncovers the applicable statutes and regulations at length in its Opening Brief CACCB\nrespectfully submits that they are consistent in all respects with the State Plan,\n\"preprinted form\" or otherwise. CACCB would add here that the requirement to\n\nprovide ICF/MR \"services\" toall eligible personswith \"no limitations\" isparticularly\ngrounded in the comparability requirement, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(10). That section\nof the Medicaid Act, regulating state-plan requirements, provides that a StatePlan\n\"must\":\n(10) provide -\n(A) for making medical assistanceavailable, including at\nleast the care and services listed in paragraphs (1) through\n(5), (17) and (21) of[42 U.S.C. ยง 1396(d)(a)] to\n(i) all individuals [covered by a host of\nvarious programs and conditions]\n(B) that the medical assistance made available to any\nindividual described in Subparagraph (a)-\n(i) shall not be less in amount, duration, or scope\nthan the medical assistance made available to any\nother such individual, and\n(ii) shall not be less in amount, duration, or scope\nthan the medical assistance made available to\nindividuals not described in subparagraph (a)[.]\n42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(10) (emphasis added). The implementing regulation for the\ncomparability section of the Act even more directly addresses that a state plan must\ninsure the availability of services:\nยง 440.240 Comparability of services for groups.\n\nExcept as limited in ยง 440.250 -\n(a) The plan must provide that the services available to any categorically\nneedy recipient under the plan are not less in amount, duration, and\nscope than those services available to a medically needy recipient; and\n(b) The plan must provide that the services available to any individual\nin the following groups are equal in amount, duration, and scope for all\nrecipients within the group:\n(1) The categorically needy.\n(2) A covered medically needy group.\n42 C.F.R. ยง 440.240 (emphasis added). 3\nThe \"preprinted form\" language in Colorado's State Plan scoffed at by the State\nwhich contains the promise that the State will provide ICF/MR services with \"no\nlimitations\" appears under the heading: \"Amount, Duration and Scope of Medical and\nRemedial Care and Services Provided to the Categorically Needy.\" See Sabree v.\nRichman, 367 F.3d 180, 192 (3d. Cir. 2004)(42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(10) creates\nenforceable rights under ยง 1983); see also Sanchez v. Johnson, 416 F.3 d 1051, 1061 -\n62 (9th Cir. 2005)(agreeing with Sabree). A comparison of the \"preprinted form\"\nwhich is part of Colorado's State Plan to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(10) and 42 C.F.R. ยง\n440.240, which govern the \"amount, duration and scope\" of services that must be\n3The regulations cited by the State Defendants at page 16 of their brief provide\nno support for their assertion that Medicaid is simply a \"payment\" scheme.\n\nprovided in all state plans, demonstrates complete consistency, not some unfounded\nultra vires obligation as claimed by the State Defendants.\nAs noted by Plaintiffs in their Reply Brief 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(2) expressly\nrequires the State of Colorado and all other States participating in Medicaid to insure\nthat any lack of local funds \"will not result in lowering of the amount, duration,\nscope, or quality of care and services available under the plan.\" Again, the focus of\nthis state-plan requirement is on the availability (and, notably, also quality) of\"care\nand services,\" not simply payment.\nThe Bruggeman dicta offers no support for the State Defendants here.\nBruggeman must be considered in light of its context. The plaintiffs in that case had\navailable to them the residential services they sought, but they were located in the\nsouthern part of the State of Illinois. The plaintiffs in that case claimed that the\nMedicaid Act required that services be provided to them closer to their home in the\nMetropolitan Chicago area. The Seventh Circuit, in almost summary fashion,\ndiscounted the plaintiffs' claims, observing that the Medicaid Act's reference to\n\"assistance\" \"appears to have reference\" to financial assistance rather than services.\n324 F.3d at 910 (emphasis added). There is no analysis of Illinois' State Plan, nor\ndoes there appear to be any consideration of the Medicaid Act other than a cursory\nlook at the the reasonable promptness provision. Indeed, the Seventh Circuit appears\n4 8\n\nto have raised its \"payment\" observation concerning the scope of the Medicaid Act\nsua sponte. The case came before it with the district court having ruled that the\nplaintiffs lacked standing to bring their claims in the first instance. There is no\nindication that this \"payment\" issue was even one raised in the briefs or addressed by\nthe plaintiffs. This Court should weigh these factors when considering the State\nDefendants' claim that \"[t]he decision in Bruggeman appears to be the only court to\nhave squarely ruled on the issue,\" in contrast to the multitude of cases cited by\nCACCB, Opening Brief at 39-41, addressing the issue after briefing by both sides.\nAs noted above, the record in this Case shows that hundreds of persons,\notherwise eligible for services, are being denied them because the State of Colorado\nhas failed to appropriate sufficient funds. This is not a situation where persons are\nbeing denied services because they live in a different part of the State than where they\ndesire to receive services. While undoubtedly some of the persons needing and\nwanting services today may choose to wait for a more desirable situation, there are\nhundreds of persons, otherwise eligible, who are officially waiting for services today,\nwho greatly need them, and would take advantage of them with \"reasonable\npromptness\" if the State would simply appropriate sufficient funds today to make\nservices available to them.\n\nIn determining a claim based upon the Americans with Disabilities Act, the\nSupreme Court in Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581 (1999) observed\nthat a State could avoid having to make alterations to its waiver program under the\nADA if it \"were to demonstrate that it had a comprehensive, effectively working plan\nfor placing qualified persons with mental disabilities in less restrictive settings, and\na waiting list that moved at a reasonable pace.\" Id__:a.t 605-06. The State of\nColorado's plan, while perhaps arguably comprehensive, is not effectively working\nwhen hundreds of eligible and needy persons are being denied services for budgetary\nreasons, nor does Colorado have \"a waiting list that move[s] at a reasonable pace.\"\nIndeed, the evidence shows that many persons and their families have waited many\nyears for services and suffered significant hardships in the process.\nCACCB respectfully urges this Court to reject the State's \"payment\" defense\nbased upon the Bruggeman dicta.\nIV. The State's \"Cap\" Defense Does Not Protect the State from Living Up to\nIts Entitlement Obligation to Provide an ICF/MR Level of Care to All\nIndividuals Who are Eligible for Medicaid Residential Services\nColorado, in its State Plan, promised the federal government that it would\nprovide \"Intermediate care facility services.., for persons determined, in accordance\nwith section 1902(a)(31)(A) of the Act, to be in need of such care.\" App.755\n(emphasis added). In its State Plan, Colorado promised the federal government that\n10\n\nit would provide such services with \"no limitations.\" Id___T.his part of Colorado's\nState Plan was approved in 1991. Id____.\nICF/MR services have been available under the Medicaid Act since 1971.4\nThey were considered at the time an improvement over the warehouse-like situations\nin which many persons received what could only loosely be defined as services.\nICFs/MR, nevertheless, were themselves institutions, and a movement developed to\nget persons with developmental disabilities out of institutions and into community\nsettings. \"Since the mid-1970s, there has been a national trend toward\ndeinstitutionalization and institution closure. ''5\nIn response to this deinstitutionalization trend, Congress enacted changes to the\nMedicaid Act that allowed States to provide services in non-institutional settings\nthrough the granting of waivers to some of the more demanding regulations that are\nnecessary in an institutional setting. The change that is at issue here is the statute that\nallows for waiver of the requirements for ICF/MR institutions so that services can be\nprovided in a community setting - the program known as Home and Community\n4Gary A. Smith, Status Report.\" Litigation Concerning Home and Community\nServices for People with Disabilities (available at\nhttp://www.hsri.org/docs/litigation050205.PDF (May 2, 2005).\n5Research and Training Center on Community Living, Institute on Community\nIntegration, \"Status of Institutional Closure Efforts in 2005\" (Sept. 2005).\n11\n\nBased Services - Developmental Disability (\"HCBS-DD\"). This statute, 42 U.S.C.\nยง 1396n(c)(1), provides, in part:\nThe Secretary may by waiver provide that a State plan\napproved under this subchapter may include as \"medical\nassistance\" under such plan payment for part or all of the\ncost of home or community-based services (other than\nroom and board) approved by the Secretary which are\nprovided pursuant to a written plan of care to individuals\nwith respect to whom there has been a determination that\nbut f_ the provision of such services the individuals\nwould require the level of care provided in a hospital or a\nnursing facility or intermediate care facility for the\nmentally retarded the cost of which could be reimbursed\nunder the State plan.\n(Emphasis added.) The correct interpretation of this statute, its implementing\nregulations, and the State's approved waiver application, rests at the heart of\nCACCB's reasonable promptness and comparability claims.\nThe State of Colorado is attempting to avoid compliance with the Medicaid Act\nby relying upon the historical fact that as a result of deinsitutionalization, the vast\nmajority of residential services are provided in HCBS-DD settings as opposed to\nICF/MR settings. The State is asserting that the only entitlement is to \"payment\" for\nICF/MR services, a service delivery model that is now used very sparingly because\nof deinstitutionalization. The State is also relying upon the fact that the waiver\nprovisions of the Medicaid Act can be capped. See 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1396n(c)(9), (10);\n12\n\n42 C.F.R. ยง 441.303(0(6 ).\nThe gist of the State's defense is as follows: it concedes ICFs/MR are an\nentitlement, but there are very few of them today, so the State has virtually no\nexposure for failing to provide ICFs/MR, particularly under its theory that it need\nonly \"pay\" for ICFs, not actually provide them. HCBS-DD, the overwhelmingly\npredominant model,6 is not an entitlement, the State argues, because, under the\nMedicaid Act, HCBS-DD canbecapped. Thus,the StateDefendants arguethatthey\nhave no obligation whatsoever to actually provide Medicaid residential services,\neither in ICFs (becausethere arevery few of them, andthey arefull) or in HCBS-DD\nsettings (becausethey arecapped).\nThe starting point in demonstrating the fallacy of the State Defendants'\nargument is the waiver statuteitself, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396n(c)(1). The statuteprovides\nthat \"but for the provision of such [waiver] services,\" an eligible person \"would\nrequire the level of care\" in anICF/MR. In other words, the waiver statuteis directly\nlinked to a State's obligation to otherwise provide anICF/MR \"level of care\" to an\neligible individual.\n6 Most of the state-run residential services provided for persons with\ndevelopmental disabilities are provided under HCBS-DD, not ICF/MR.\n13\n\nThis requirement is mirrored in the regulations. Section 441.302 of 42 C.F.R.\ncontains the necessaryassurancesthat Statesmust provide the federal government to\nparticipate in the waiver program. Section 441.302(c)(1)(ii) requires that the State\nof Colorado assure\"[t]hat the recipient, but for the provision of waiver services,\nwould otherwise beinstitutionalized in sucha[ICF/MR] facility.\" Similarly, section\n441.302(g), captioned \"institutionalization absentwaiver,\" requires assurancesfrom\nthe Stateof Colorado that \"absent the waiver, recipients in the waiver would receive\nthe appropriate type of Medicaid funded institutional care (hospital, NF, or ICF/MR)\nthat they require.\" (Emphasis added.)\nThe State of Colorado's Waiver Application, App.856, tracks these essential\nfederal requirements. Paragraph 2 states: \"This waiver is requested in order to\nprovide home and community-based services to individuals who, but for the\nprovision of such services, would require the following levels (s) of care, the cost of\nwhich could be reimbursed under the approved Medicaid State plan.\" (Emphasis\nadded.) Subparagraph b, describing ICF/MR care, is then checked. Consistent with\n42 C.F.R. ยงยง 441.302(g) and 441.302(c)(ii), the State's Waiver Application contains\nthe assurance that: \"Absent the waiver, persons served in the waiver would receive\nthe appropriate type of Medicaid-funded institutional care that they require, as\n14\n\nindicated in item 2 of this request.\" Paragraph 16g,App.864 (emphasis added)]\nIn short, the waiver statute, its implementing regulations, and the State of\nColorado's Waiver Application, all show that the HCBS-DD waiver is simply an\nalternative vehicle created by Congress to allow the States that offer ICF/MR\nservicesaspart of their stateplans the option of providing anICF/MR \"level of care\"\nto eligible persons in a\"home and community based\" setting) The fact that a State\ncan expand or contract the size of the HCBS-DD program as it seesfit does not\nmitigate in any way the overarching obligation that the State has to all persons\neligible for services - so long asthe Statechooses to \"provide\" ICF/MR \"services\"\nto all eligible persons with \"no limitations\" in its Stateplan.\nIn their brief, the StateDefendants posit a straw-man argument and then, not\nsurprisingly, strike it down by observing that \"we must reject CACCB's argument\n7Portions of the State Medicaid Manual placed in evidence by the State further\nexplain that the waiver merely provides \"an alternative to institutionalization,\"\nApp.915, and does not relieve the State from providing services to persons eligible\nunder the State Plan. As the State Medicaid Manual describes: \"A home and\ncommunity-based services waiver offers you [the State] broad discretion not generally\nafforded under the State plan to address the needs of individuals who would\notherwise receive costly institutional care provided under the State Medicaid plan.\"\nId__(.emphasis added).\n8The State Defendants, in their Statement of the Facts, acknowledge: \"One of\nthese waivers allows Colorado to offer HCBS to persons with DD who would\notherwise need services in an ICF/MR.\" Answer Brief at 8-9 (emphasis added).\n15\n\nthat there can be no cap for HCBS-DD services.\" Answer Brief at 26. As shown,\nCACCB makes no such argument.\nThe State Defendants get a little closer by stating that \"CACCB argues that\nColorado has a generalized obligation to provide services to persons who need\nICF/MR level of services, and that Colorado could choose to meet this obligation by\noffering more HCBS-DD.\" Answer Brief at 26. The State Defendants then assert that\nthey can defeat this argument by refuting that \"Colorado has an obligation to provide\nICF/MR services.\" Id__a_t_.27.\nThe State Defendants then proceed to attempt to refute that Colorado has an\nobligation to provide ICF/MR services, not by analyzing the Medicaid Act, the\nimplementing regulations, Colorado's State Plan, or its Waiver Application -\ndiscussed above - but by completely recasting CACCB's case into something far\nmore manageable from their perspective:\n[CACCB's and Plaintiff's] arguments seem to take two forms. First,\nthey argue that any waiting list for any non-waiver Medicaid service, of\nitself, is a violation of Medicaid law, and the State must do whatever is\nnecessary to end the waiting list. Under this form of the argument, it\ndoes not matter why there is a waiting list. Second, they argue that\nColorado has violated Medicaid law because it does not encourage the\ndevelopment of any new ICFs/MR. Under this form of the argument,\nthey must prove that Colorado has caused the absence of ICFs/MR\n16\n\nAnswer Brief at 28. CACCB respectfully would like to point out the following flaws\nwith the State Defendants' assertions. First, the \"two forms\" of arguments asserted\nby the State Defendants have nothing to do with the point that the State does indeed\nhave a \"a generalized obligation to provide services to persons who need an ICF/MR\nlevel of services,\" Answer Brief at 26, under the Medicaid Act and waiver statute, so\nlong as Colorado's State Plan and Waiver Application say what they say.\nSecond, it does matter why there is a waiting list. If there were legitimate\nprogrammatic reasons why persons were waiting for services, that would be entirely\ndifferent from the situation in this case. CACCB asserts in this Court that a waiting\nlist, intentionally maintained and managed by the State of Colorado, consisting of\nhundreds of eligible persons, many of whom have waited years for service, solely for\nbudgetary reasons, is a violation of the Medicaid Act's reasonable promptness and\ncomparability requirements.\nThird, CACCB and the Plaintiffs do not have to prove that Colorado has caused\nthe absence of ICFs/MR, although they did so in the trial court below. CACCB's and\nPlaintiffs' ICF/MR availability evidence was merely introduced in the trial court\nbelow to help show the district court that the payment defense was a pretense. To\nestablish a violation of reasonable promptness and comparability, CACCB and\nPlaintiffs need only demonstrate that the Medicaid Act, the waiver statute, Colorado' s\n17\n\nState Plan and its Waiver Application, all obligate the State to provide an ICF/MR\nlevel of care, either in an ICF/MR or in an HCBS-DD setting, and that the State is\ndenying eligible persons of these services for budgetary reasons. In any event, the\nfact-intensive nature of the State Defendant's defense was never even addressed by\nthe district court below, because it ruled, as a matter of law, that CACCB and\nPlaintiffs could not be awarded relief that would require the State to appropriate\nadditional funds for residential services.\nThe State Defendants' attempts to completely redefine the playing field should\nbe rejected along with any defense resting upon the non-contested principle that the\nwaiver program is capped.\nV. CACCB Does Indeed Have a Private Cause of Action for Pursuing Its\nRates Claim and This Court Should Remand This Claim for a\nDetermination on the Merits\nAs noted in CACCB's Opening Brief CACCB acknowledges that there is a\nsplit in the circuits on this issue. The State Defendants's Answer Brief does little\nmore than cite the jurisdictions that go their way. What is readily apparent after\nreading the State Defendants' brief is that the question of whether CACCB can assert\na claim under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 for a violation of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(30)(A) hinges\nupon this Court's interpretation of Wilder v. Va. Hosp. Ass'n, 496 U.S. 498 (1990).\n18\n\nIn its Opening Brief, CACCB demonstrated why Wilder controls this case. In\nresponse, the State - like the jurisdictions that have ruled that ยง 1396a(a)(30)(A) is\nnot actionable under ยง 1983 - tries to distinguish the Boren Amendment, formerly 42\nU.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(13)(A), which the Supreme Court considered in Wilde_r, from ยง\n1396a(a)(30)(A). The State Defendants' attempt, however, falls short of warranting\na result different from the result in Wilder.\nThe State Defendants concede that the Boren Amendment \"bears a superficial\nresemblance\" to ยง 1396a(a)(30)(A), Answer Brief at 34, but then assert that, in\nactuality, they are \"really quite different.\" The first major difference, the State\nDefendants assert, is that the Boren Amendment involved a State making \"findings\nand assurances\" to the federal government, while ยง 1396a(a)(30)(A) involves only\n\"methods and procedures.\"\nThe Supreme Court in Wilder analyzed the Boren Amendment at length in\nconcluding that it created enforceable rights under ยง 1983. The Supreme Court noted\nin its analysis that the legislative history of the Boren Amendment included an earlier\namendment that gave the States additional discretion to determine, in the first\ninstance, what rates were appropriate by employing their own \"methods and\nstandards\" for calculating rates in the first instance. 496 U.S. at 505-06. This change\nafforded the States additional flexibility to determine what rates were \"reasonable.\"\n19\n\nId__a_t__5.06. The flexibility afforded by allowing the States to define for themselves the\nappropriate \"methods and standards,\" embodied in the later Boren Amendment, did\nnot make this provision unenforceable under ยง 1983, as the Court found in Wilde_yr.\nCACCB submits that \"methods and procedures\" and \"methods and standards\" are a\ndistinction without a difference.\nSecond, the State Defendants state that under the Boren Amendment, \"there\nwas a specific and objective.., measure of quality of care, i.e. the care must conform\nto applicable laws, regulations, and quality standards,\" while ยง 1396a(a)(30)(A)\n\"contains no definition or standard for 'quality of care.'\" Answer Brief at 35\n(emphasis added). The Supreme Court in Wilder noted that, under the Boren\nAmendment, rates had to be:\n\"reasonable and adequate\" to meet the costs of \"efficiently and\neconomically operated facilities.\" The State must also assure the\nSecreta_3z that individuals have \"reasonable access\" to facilities of\n\"adequate quality.\" The Act does not define these terms, and the\nSecretary has declined to adopt a national definition, concluding that\nStates should determine the factors to be considered in determining\nwhat rates are \"reasonable and adequate\" to meet the costs of\n\"efficiently and economically operated facilit[ies].\"\n496 U.S. at 507 (emphasis added). The Boren Amendment and ยง 1396a(a)(30)(A)\nboth permit the States, in the first instance, to define what are appropriate rates. This\nsubstantial discretion, however, did not make ยง 1396a(a)(30)(A) inactionable under\n20\n\nยง 1983. As noted by the Supreme Court:\nThat the amendment gives the Statessubstantial discretion in choosing\namong reasonable methods of calculating ratesmay affect the standard\nunder which a court reviews whether the rates comply with the\namendment, but it doesnot render the amendment unenforceable by a\ncourt. While there may be a range of reasonable rates, there certainly\nare some rates outside that range that no State could ever find to be\nreasonable and adequate under the Act. Although some knowledge of\nthe hospital industry might be required to evaluate a State's findings\nwith respect to the reasonableness of its rates, such an inquiry is well\nwithin the competence of the Judiciary.\nId__a_t_.519-20 (emphasis in original). The State Defendants' argument that the Boren\nAmendment provided \"definition\" where ยง 1396a(a)(30)(A) does not, does not\nwithstand even a cursory reading of Wilder.\nThe critical language, per the Court, was the \"must\" language that appears in\nthe introductory language of ยง 1396a(a), and the \"payment\" language in the Boren\nAmendment:\nThe Boren Amendment is cast in mandatory rather than precatory terms:\nThe state plan \"must\" \"provide for payment . . . of hospital[s]\"\naccording to rates the State finds are reasonable and adequate.\nId__a_t_.512 (emphasis in original). Similarly, ยง 1396a(a)(30)(A), necessarily contains\nthe same \"must\" language ofยง 1396a(a), and virtually identical \"payment\" language.\nThe State Defendants' attempt to distinguish Wilder is unavailing.\n21\n\nThe StateDefendants make a number of other representations that warrant a\nbrief response. First, the State Defendants appear to suggest that CACCB's rates\nclaim must be limited to an allegation that low rates have harmed quality. That is not\ntrue. There are four standards set forth in ยง 1396a(a)(30)(A): efficiency, economy,\nquality of care, and access to services. As discussed in CACCB's Opening Brief at\n50, 53, CACCB asserts that all four standards are violated under the existing rates,\nand CACCB introduced evidence relating to all four standards. Opening Brief at 21-\n27. Second, the State Defendants argue that the efficiency and economy standards\ncannot be at issue because CACCB seeks to raise rates. Answer Brief at 32. The\nState Defendants fail to grasp that rates can be so low that they are inefficient and/or\nuneconomical. For example, as noted in CACCB's Opening Brief when rates are so\nlow that Community Centered Boards are incapable of paying sufficient wages, high\nturnover occurs, which significantly harms efficiency and economy. Third, the State\nDefendants seek to avoid this obvious conclusion by asserting that CACCB's member\nCCBs are \"free to\" increase salaries if they think it will minimize turnover. If the\nrates the State pays will not support higher salaries, the CCBs are not \"free to\" raise\nsalaries.\n22\n\nFinally, the State Defendants assert that even if CACCB can bring a ยง\n1396a(a)(30)(A) claim under ยง 1983,this Court should defer to the \"finding\" by the\ndistrict court that addressed\"quality of care.\" The district court did not make any\nfindings of fact or conclusions of law in dismissing all of the claims before it, save\nfor the oneconclusion thatall claims then-pending should bedismissed becausethey\ncalled for a remedy the district court found inappropriate. Any allusion the district\ncourt madeto virtually irrelevant evidence concerning lack of enforcement actions\nagainst Community Centered Boards or their service agencies by the Colorado\nDepartment of Health should in no way be construed asafinding of fact warranting\ndeference by this Court.\n23\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe Court should reverse the district court, remand with instructions to the\ndistrict court to enter judgment in favor of CACCB and the Plaintiffs on the\nreasonable promptness and comparability claims, order the State to develop a plan to\neliminate the waiting list, and conduct further proceedings and address the merits of\nCACCB's rates claim taking into consideration the effects of eliminating the waiting\nlist.\nDated: November 23, 2005.\nx.

Six such persons and an association of\nproviders brought this suit under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, claiming that the State of Colorado\nhas failed to comply with three requirements of the Medicaid Act, namely reasonable\npromptness, comparability, and sufficient payments. After a bench trial, the district court\nentered judgment for the Defendants. We hold that the reasonable promptness and\ncomparability requirements do not require the State to provide services, and that neither\nrecipients nor providers have a private right to enforce the sufficient payments\nrequirement through ยง 1983. We therefore AFFIRM.\nI. Factual and Procedural Background\n2 This suit was brought in August 2000 by six persons, through their parents and\nguardians, against the governor of Colorado and two other state officials. The six\nindividual plaintiffs are developmentally disabled persons who are on waiting lists for\ncomprehensive residential services. These services are provided by public and private\nentities, which are paid by the State, which is in turn reimbursed for about half of the\ncosts by the federal government through Medicaid. See 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a. The State offers\ntwo kinds of Medicaid-funded services relevant to this suit. An Intermediate Care Facility\nfor the Mentally Retarded (ICF/MR) is an institutional setting, usually large, and is\n\"generally reserved for persons with extreme needs.\" Appellees' Answer Br. 5. Three such\nfacilities exist in Colorado, and they serve about 86 persons. Two of these facilities are\nmanaged by the State, and one is operated by a private organization. The State also\nprovides Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS). In an HCBS setting,\ndevelopmentally disabled persons live \"in either a small host home (serving 1 to 3 people)\nor slightly larger group homes (serving 4 to 8 people).\" Id. at 9. Over the last quarter-\ncentury the State has shifted its emphasis from ICFs/MR to HCBS, which are less\nexpensive and less isolating.\n3 Home and Community-Based Services are \"waiver programs,\" which means that the\nState may offer them only after securing a waiver of certain Medicaid requirements from\nthe federal government. They are also capped by the state's waiver application wherein a\nstate must indicate the maximum number of participants it will accept in its waiver\nprogram. At the time of trial nearly 3,800 persons received HCB services. Another 733\npersons wished to receive HCB services, but the services were unavailable. Roughly half\nof these 733 persons received no state services of any kind for the developmentally\ndisabled. At the time of trial, only 21 persons were seeking ICF/MR services. The\nplaintiffs sought ICF/MR services, and each contended that the needed services were\nunavailable because the State refused to comply with federal law.\n4 In October 2000, the Colorado Association of Community Centered Boards (CACCB)\nmoved to intervene on the side of the plaintiffs. Community-centered boards are HCBS\nproviders offering housing and medical care to the developmentally disabled and\nreceiving, in return, Medicaid payments from the state.\n5 Suing under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, the plaintiffs and intervenor alleged violations of the\n2 of 9 1/22/2011 9:16 AM\n\n464 F.3d 1139 http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/464/464.F3d.1139.05-1150.05-1...\nfederal Medicaid Act, specifically that the State failed to provide the developmentally\nยซ up\ndisabled with comprehensive residential services that meet the statutory requirements of\nreasonable promptness and comparability, which are described below. The individual\nplaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment and an injunction that would compel the state to\nmeet the statute's requirements, but they did not and do not ask the courts to specify the\nway in which the State should comply with the statute. The individual plaintiffs sought\nclass certification on behalf of all developmentally disabled persons in Colorado who\nremain on waiting lists to receive comprehensive medical services. Although opposing\nclass certification, the CACCB generally supported the individual plaintiffs' claim. The\nCACCB also claimed that the State pays for Medicaid services for the developmentally\ndisabled at rates that are too low to meet the statutory requirement of sufficient\npayments.\n6 The district court denied class certification and, after a four-day trial, entered\njudgment for the Defendants. The plaintiffs now appeal.1\nII. Reasonable Promptness and Comparability\n7 We begin with the claim that the State has failed to comply with the requirements of\nreasonable promptness and comparability. If a state chooses to participate in Medicaid, it\nmust submit a state plan for providing \"medical assistance.\" 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a). The\nMedicaid Act imposes a number of conditions on a state plan, two of which are at issue in\nthis case. The first is that medical assistance \"shall be furnished with reasonable\npromptness to all eligible individuals.\" Id. ยง 1396a(a)(8). The second, the comparability\nrequirement, is that the assistance any patient receives \"shall not be less in amount,\nduration, or scope than the medical assistance made available to any other such\nindividual.\" Id. ยง 1396a(a)(10)(B)(i).\n8 In addressing these claims, we assume that the individual plaintiffs may sue to enforce\ntheir rights under subsections (8) and (10). Since the Supreme Court clarified when a\nstatute creates an enforceable private right in Gonzaga University v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273,\n122 S.Ct. 2268, 153 L.Ed.2d 309 (2002), several circuit courts have considered whether\none or both of these subsections creates an enforceable private right. Each has concluded\nthat the provision in question does. See, e.g., Watson v. Weeks, 436 F.3d 1152, 1159 & n. 8\n(9th Cir.2006) (following the five federal circuit courts that have found a private right to\nsue for enforcement of ยง 1396a(a)(10), two of which did so after Gonzaga); Sabree v.\nRichman, 367 F.3d 180, 192 (3d Cir.2004) (finding that each provision created an\nenforceable private right). But see Sanders ex rel. Rayl v. Kan. Dep't of Soc. and Rehab.\nServs., 317 F.Supp.2d 1233, 1250 (D.Kan.2004) (concluding that subsection (8) does not\ncreate an enforceable private right but finding it \"a closer question\" than for some\nMedicaid provisions); M.A.C. v. Betit, 284 F.Supp.2d 1298, 1307 (D.Utah 2003)\n(concluding that subsection (8) does not create an enforceable private right). In this case,\nthe district court did not clearly decide whether this portion of the statute creates a\nfederal right enforceable under ยง 1983, but the parties have not disputed the point. We\ntherefore assume without deciding that ยง 1983 gives the plaintiffs a right of action to\nenforce subsections (8) and (10). See Burks v. Lasker, 441 U.S. 471, 475-76 & n. 5, 99 S.Ct.\n1831, 60 L.Ed.2d 404 (1979) (\"The question whether a cause of action exists is not a\nquestion of jurisdiction, and therefore may be assumed without being decided.\").\n9 On the merits, the plaintiffs' reasonable promptness and comparability claims are two\nways of characterizing one problem: that the individual plaintiffs are not receiving the\ncomprehensive residential services they need. They are thus (1) not receiving them\npromptly and (2) not receiving them to the extent that others receive them. The outcome\nof both claims turns on the same question: What is the \"medical assistance\" that the State\n3 of 9 1/22/2011 9:16 AM\n\n464 F.3d 1139 http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/464/464.F3d.1139.05-1150.05-1...\nmust provide promptly and equally?\nยซ up\n10 The Medicaid Act defines \"medical assistance\" as \"payment of part or all of the cost of\nthe [described] care and services.\" 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396d(a). The statutory definition\nmentions payment for, but not provision of, services. In other words, \"the statutory\nreference to `assistance' appears to have reference to financial assistance rather than to\nactual medical services.\" Bruggeman ex rel. Bruggeman v. Blagojevich, 324 F.3d 906,\n910 (7th Cir.2003); see also Westside Mothers v. Olszewski, 454 F.3d 532, 540 (6th\nCir.2006) (concluding that 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1396a(a)(8) and (10) do not \"require the State to\nprovide medical services directly\" but rather require only financial assistance).2 On its\nface, then, the Medicaid Act requires any state participating in Medicaid to pay promptly\nand evenhandedly for medical services when the state is presented with the bill. If that is\nall the statute requires, then the plaintiffs have no claim: they are on a waiting list for\nservices, not a waiting list for payment for services.\n11 The plaintiffs offer two reasons we should reject the natural reading of the statute. The\nfirst is that the definition of \"medical assistance,\" when read in context, requires the State\nto provide actual services and not merely to pay for them. The plaintiffs point to five\ncontextual clues that \"medical assistance\" means actual services and not just financial\npayments. None of these clues, however, is sufficiently convincing to depart from the\nstatutory definition of \"medical assistance.\"\n12 First, the plaintiffs point to another provision in the Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง\n1396a(a)(2), which requires the State to \"assure that the lack of adequate funds from local\nsources will not result in lowering the amount, duration, scope or quality of care and\nservices available under the plan.\" But this requirement explicitly controls the method of\n\"financial participation by the State.\" Id. (emphasis added). The State must ensure that\nthe non-federal portion of an eligible patient's bill is paid, by picking up any slack from\n\"local sources\" of funding, but this provision says nothing about providing the services\nthemselves.\n13 Second, the plaintiffs suggest that the comparability provision requires the State to\nprovide actual services because the \"medical assistance\" must be the same \"in amount,\nduration, or scope.\" 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(10)(B)(i). The words of this provision, however,\ncan apply to the payment for services no less logically than to the provision of services. It\nis coherent, and consistent with the text of the comparability provision, to require states\nto pay for services on a comparable basis โ in the same amounts, for the same duration,\nand in the same scope. Accordingly, this provision does not indicate which meaning we\nshould give to \"medical assistance,\" and it thus gives us no reason to depart from the\ngeneral statutory definition for the Medicaid Act.\n14 Third, the plaintiffs suggest that the State must provide services whenever necessary\nto assure that \"care and services will be provided[ ] in a manner consistent with simplicity\nof administration and the best interests of the recipients.\" 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(19). The\nplaintiffs give scant attention to this argument, and for good reason. In Bruggeman the\nSeventh Circuit held that this provision was \"insufficiently definite to be justiciable, and\nin addition cannot be interpreted to create a private right of action.\" Bruggeman, 324\nF.3d at 911 (citing three other circuits that have reached the same conclusion, under the\nMedicaid Act or under ยง 1983). We need not reach the private-right-of-action question,\nwhich is not before us, to determine that this provision does not require the State to\nprovide actual services. If this provision implicitly required the State to provide services,\nbecause it is something in the \"best interests of the recipients,\" we see no logical end.\nWithout a logical stopping point or anything more definite than \"best interests,\" we do\nnot read this provision to require the State to provide actual services.\n4 of 9 1/22/2011 9:16 AM\n\n464 F.3d 1139 http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/464/464.F3d.1139.05-1150.05-1...\nFourth, the plaintiffs point to the plan the State filed with the federal government,\nยซ up\nwhich promised to provide ICFs/MR with \"No Limitations.\" Colorado State Medicaid\nPlan, R. Vol. IV, at 755. This phrase appears in the state plan on a page titled \"Amount,\nDuration and Scope of Medical and Remedial Care and Services Provided to the\nCategorically Needy.\" Id. A series of services are mentioned, from ICFs/MR to nurse-\nmidwife services, and for each the government checked boxes indicating that the services\nare provided with \"No Limitations,\" are provided \"With Limitations,\" or are \"Not\nProvided.\" Id. As the director of the State's Medical Assistance Office explained,\n\"limitations\" are limits on payments to otherwise eligible patients, such as the limit that\nthe State will pay for only 45 days of in-patient psychiatric services in a calendar year. R.\nVol. II, at 350. If the State wishes to enforce such a limit on the provided services it will\npay for, it must announce the limit in the state plan. By choosing \"No Limitations,\" the\nState was abjuring limits such as the length of ICF/MR services for which it would pay,\nbut there is no indication that by checking this box the State promised to build, staff, and\nmaintain as many ICFs/MR as would be needed to meet the demand in Colorado.\n16 Fifth, the plaintiffs assert that Colorado's waiver application indicates a commitment to\nensuring that every eligible patient receives services, either from ICFs/MR or HCBS. The\nwaiver application provides that a developmentally disabled adult deemed to require the\nlevel of care offered by an ICF/MR will be \"informed of any feasible alternatives\" to\nICFs/MR and \"[g]iven the choice of either institutional or home and community-based\nservices.\" R. Vol. IV, at 863. Although the waiver application suggests that a\ndevelopmentally disabled person will have a choice between an ICF/MR and HCBS, it\ndoes not assign to the State, or any other party, the responsibility to ensure that such\nfacilities are in fact available. Indeed, the waiver application appears to mean only that\nthe choice among \"feasible alternatives\" is to be made by the recipient โ not that the\nState must make alternatives available. Because it is at best ambiguous on the point, it\nprovides no reason to reject the natural reading of the statutory definition. None of these\nfive contextual clues, therefore, undermines the statutory definition of \"medical\nassistance\" as payment for services.\n17 The plaintiffs' second reason to reject the payment-only reading of \"medical\nassistance\" is policy based. The plaintiffs accuse the State of promising to pay for services\nfor the developmentally disabled and then suppressing the supply of these services. They\nare effectively asking us, in the alternative, (1) to conclude that in the context of the\nMedicaid Act, the state plan, and the State's waiver application, \"medical assistance\"\nincludes a requirement that the State be a service-provider of the last resort; or (2) to\ngraft onto \"medical assistance\" a good-faith requirement that would oblige the state not\nto discourage proposals from outside care providers. Such a good-faith requirement has\nintuitive appeal, for the State has obvious conflicts of interest. At oral argument the State\neven conceded that it may not escape paying for ICF/MR services by setting rates so low\nthat no one can provide them. Cf. Westside Mothers, 454 F.3d at 541 (allowing plaintiffs,\nafter amending their complaint, \"to allege that inadequate payments effectively deny the\nright to `medical assistance'\").\n18 Nevertheless, we need not decide whether a state has (or may assume) a good-faith\nobligation not to prevent new entrants into this market. The precise claim brought by the\nplaintiffs is narrow. The plaintiffs do not suggest that ICF/MR rates have been set so low\nas to prohibit new entrants to the market. Nor do the plaintiffs claim that the State has\ndiscouraged efforts to build HCBS facilities, which is where the greatest shortfall in\nfacilities exists. And the plaintiffs do not claim that the state has denied or effectively\ndenied (through delay or similar means) a formal application to build new ICF/MR\nfacilities. Indeed, the plaintiffs could not claim this, because no such applications have\nbeen filed. Instead, the individual plaintiffs claim that the State has discouraged efforts to\n5 of 9 1/22/2011 9:16 AM\n\n464 F.3d 1139 http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/464/464.F3d.1139.05-1150.05-1...\nbuild new ICFs/MR by responding cooly to initial inquiries. This is too nebulous a basis to\nยซ up\nsupport a legal claim. It is the State's prerogative to prefer HCBS over ICFs/MR โ a\npreference shared by many advocates for the developmentally disabled โ and to make\nthat policy preference known. Assuming arguendo that the State has a duty (either\nstatutory or self-imposed) not to prevent new entrants who could provide ICF/MR\nservices, it violated no such duty here, where it neither rejected nor was even presented\nwith any formal applications. If a case arises in which the State has effectively prevented a\nqualified provider of ICF/MR services from entering the market, we will have to decide\nwhether such a good-faith requirement exists.\n19 We therefore agree with the Sixth and Seventh Circuits that the Medicaid statute does\nnot require states to be service-providers of last resort. See Westside Mothers, 454 F.3d at\n540; Bruggeman, 324 F.3d at 910. Although Bruggeman concerned a claim about the\nlocation of ICFs/MR within a state, and not about the lack of them, the Seventh Circuit's\nconclusion is directly on point and persuasive:\n20 Medicaid is a payment scheme, not a scheme for state-provided medical assistance, as\nthrough state-owned hospitals. The regulations that implement the provision indicate\nthat what is required is a prompt determination of eligibility and prompt provision of\nfunds to eligible individuals to enable them to obtain the covered medical services that\nthey need . . .; a requirement of prompt treatment would amount to a direct regulation of\nmedical services.\n21 Bruggeman, 324 F.3d at 910. The State must pay for medical services, but it need not\nprovide them.\nIII. Rates\n22 A second claim is brought only by the CACCB: that the State payments for waiver\nservices (HCBS) are insufficient to comply with the Medicaid Act. Specifically, the CACCB\nclaims that the rates at which the State pays for waiver services violate 42 U.S.C. ยง\n1396a(a)(30)(A), which requires a state to\n23 provide such methods and procedures relating to the utilization of, and the payment\nfor, care and services available under the plan . . . as may be necessary to safeguard\nagainst unnecessary utilization of such care and services and to assure that payments are\nconsistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care and are sufficient to enlist enough\nproviders so that care and services are available under the plan at least to the extent that\nsuch care and services are available to the general population in the geographic area.\n24 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(30)(A). CACCB brings this claim not only for itself, as an\nassociation of providers, but also on behalf of recipients generally (though not on behalf\nof the six individual plaintiffs). Before we can reach the merits of the claim, we must\ndecide whether subsection (30)(A) creates a private right enforceable under ยง 1983.\nSection 1983 imposes liability on anyone who, under color of state law, deprives a person\n\"of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws.\" To seek\nredress through ยง 1983, a plaintiff must assert a violation of a federal right, not merely a\nviolation of federal law. Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329, 340, 117 S.Ct. 1353, 137\nL.Ed.2d 569 (1997). The Court has set forth three criteria necessary to finding that a\nstatutory provision gives rise to a federal right:\n25 First, Congress must have intended that the provision in question benefit the plaintiff.\nSecond, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the right assertedly protected by the statute\nis not so \"vague and amorphous\" that its enforcement would strain judicial competence.\nThird, the statute must unambiguously impose a binding obligation on the States. In\n6 of 9 1/22/2011 9:16 AM\n\n464 F.3d 1139 http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/464/464.F3d.1139.05-1150.05-1...\nother words, the provision giving rise to the asserted right must be couched in\nยซ up\nmandatory, rather than precatory, terms.\n26 Id. at 340-41, 117 S.Ct. 1353 (citations omitted). Once a plaintiff demonstrates that a\nstatute creates a federal right, the right is presumptively enforceable under ยง 1983 unless\nCongress specifically foreclosed such a remedy. Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284, 122 S.Ct. 2268\n& n. 4.\n27 In Wilder v. Va. Hosp. Ass'n, 496 U.S. 498, 110 S.Ct. 2510, 110 L.Ed.2d 455 (1990) the\nSupreme Court considered a Medicaid provision with wording very similar to subsection\n(30)(A), and the Court did find an enforceable private right.3 In Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at\n283, 122 S.Ct. 2268, however, the Supreme Court tightened the first requirement. After\nGonzaga, an enforceable private right exists only if the statute contains nothing \"short of\nan unambiguously conferred right\" and not merely a vague benefit or interest. Id. No\nenforceable right exists \"where a statute by its terms grants no private rights to any\nidentifiable class.\" Id. at 283-84, 122 S.Ct. 2268. Although professing not to overrule\nWilder, Gonzaga recharacterized the earlier decision as a case finding an enforceable\nprivate right in a \"provision [that] required States to pay an `objective' monetary\nentitlement to individual health care providers.\" See Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 280, 122 S.Ct.\n2268; see also id. at 300, 122 S.Ct. 2268 n. 8 (Stevens, J., dissenting).\n28 Since Gonzaga, four circuit courts have considered whether subsection (30)(A) creates\nan enforceable private right. Three have concluded that the provision does not create an\nenforceable right. Westside Mothers v. Olszewski, 454 F.3d 532, 542-43 (6th Cir.2006)\n(concluding that subsection (30)(A) \"has an aggregate focus rather than an individual\nfocus\" and its \"broad and nonspecific\" language is \"ill-suited to judicial remedy\");\nSanchez v. Johnson, 416 F.3d 1051, 1059 (9th Cir.2005) (finding no enforceable private\nright for recipients or providers because \"nothing in the text of ยง 30(A) . . . unmistakably\nfocuses on recipients or providers as individuals\" and because \"the flexible,\nadministrative standards embodied in the statute do not reflect a Congressional intent to\nprovide a private remedy for their violation\"); Long Term Pharmacy Alliance v.\nFerguson, 362 F.3d 50, 57 (1st Cir.2004) (finding no enforceable private right for\nproviders because subsection (30)(A) \"has no `rights creating language' and identifies no\ndiscrete class of beneficiaries\"). Only one circuit has found an enforceable private right.\nPediatric Specialty Care, Inc. v. Ark. Dep't of Human Servs., 443 F.3d 1005, 1015-16 (8th\nCir.2006) (following prior circuit precedent that subsection (30)(A) created an\nenforceable private right for recipients and providers, and concluding that even after\nGonzaga the provision \"creates enforceable rights for both groups\").\n29 We join the First, Sixth, and Ninth Circuits in concluding that subsection (30)(A) does\nnot create a federal right enforceable under ยง 1983. Even though Wilder addressed a\nsimilar statute, our approach is controlled by Gonzaga, the Supreme Court's most recent\nassessment of private rights of action. Applying that analysis, we conclude that\nsubsection (30)(A) \"identifies no discrete class of beneficiaries.\" Long Term Health Care\nPharmacy Alliance, 362 F.3d at 57. This provision refers to recipients only \"in the\naggregate, as members of `the general population in the geographic area'\"; and providers\nare mentioned only \"as indirect beneficiaries `enlisted' as subordinate partners in the\nadministration of Medicaid services.\" Westside Mothers, 454 F.3d at 542-43 (quoting 42\nU.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(30)(A)). Recipients and providers surely benefit from efficient Medicaid\nadministration, for example, as do taxpayers generally, but subsection (30)(A) never\nestablishes an \"identifiable class\" of rights-holders. And without such an identifiable\nclass, no enforceable federal right is created. Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283-84, 122 S.Ct.\n2268.\n7 of 9 1/22/2011 9:16 AM\n\n464 F.3d 1139 http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/464/464.F3d.1139.05-1150.05-1...\nBecause subsection (30)(A) fails to satisfy the first of the criteria set forth in Blessing\nยซ up\nfor establishing a federal right enforceable under ยง 1983, there is no need for us to\nconsider the other criteria. See Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 287-89, 122 S.Ct. 2268 (holding that\ncertain provisions of federal law are not privately enforceable under ยง 1983 because there\nwas no congressional intent to confer rights on individual beneficiaries, without\nconsideration of other Blessing factors); cf. id. at 292, 122 S.Ct. 2268 (Breyer, J.,\nconcurring) (agreeing with the majority but also concluding that \"[m]uch of the statute's\nkey language is broad and nonspecific\").\n31 One circuit has found that subsection (30)(A) creates an enforceable private right.\nRelying on its own precedent, Wilder, and Gonzaga, the Eighth Circuit found that both\nrecipients and providers could sue to enforce this subsection. Pediatric Specialty Care,\n443 F.3d at 1015-16. In analyzing Gonzaga, the court concluded that \"[t]he beneficiaries\n[of subsection (30)(A)] are both the recipients of the services and the recipients of the\nstate's payment,\" i.e., the providers. Id. at 1015. We respectfully disagree. Despite the fact\nthat recipients and providers ultimately benefit from competent administration, they are\nnowhere identified in the statutory provision as a class of beneficiaries. And Gonzaga\nrequires not a vague benefit or interest but rather an \"unambiguously conferred right.\"\n536 U.S. at 283, 122 S.Ct. 2268. In sum, because the provision does not confer\nenforceable federal rights on identified beneficiaries, Gonzaga precludes interpreting\nsubsection (30)(A) to create a federal right enforceable under ยง 1983.\nIV. Class Certification\n32 Finally, the plaintiffs also challenge the district court's denial of class certification.\nBecause this opinion disposes of all issues in the potential class action, plaintiffs' motion\nfor class certification is now moot. See Gullickson v. Sw. Airlines Pilots' Ass'n, 87 F.3d\n1176, 1187 (10th Cir.1996); Rucker v. St. Louis Sw. Ry. Co., 917 F.2d 1233, 1237 n. 1 (10th\nCir.1990).\nV. Conclusion\n33 For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court's entry of judgment in favor of\nthe defendants.\nNotes:\n1 One individual plaintiff began receiving the needed services shortly before trial. She does not\nappeal\n2 Some courts have suggested that there exists a circuit split on the question of whether \"medical\nassistance\" requires a state to provide actual servicesSabree ex rel. Sabree v. Richman, 367 F.3d\n180, 181 n. 1 (3d Cir.2004); Westside Mothers, 454 F.3d at 540. The existence of such a split is not\nentirely clear. Two circuits have held that \"medical assistance.\" requires only financial assistance.\nSee Bruggeman, 324 F.3d at 910; Westside Mothers, 454 F.3d at 540. Another circuit has\nreserved the question. Sabree, 367 F.3d at 181. Without expressly addressing the issue, two other\ncircuits appear to have treated the statute as requiring the provision of actual services. Bryson v.\nShumway, 308 F.3d 79, 81, 88-89 (1st Cir.2002); Doe v. Chiles, 136 F.3d 709, 714, 717 (11th\nCir.1998).\n3 The statute, which was known as the Boren Amendment and has since been repealed, was the\nprevious version of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1902(a)(13).
