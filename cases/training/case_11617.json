Plaintiff, represented by Community Legal Aid Society, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that her rights were violated when an apartment in a community-living facility was not modified to suit her needs.

Because these modifications were not made, the plaintiff could not live safely in the apartment.</p><p>On September 11, 2001, the Court (Judge Roderick R.
