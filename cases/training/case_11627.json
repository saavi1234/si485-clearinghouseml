The plaintiffs, represented by the Advocacy Center for Persons with Disabilities, asked the Court for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that state officials routinely denied or provided without reasonable promptness critical HCBW services for Medicaid-eligible, developmentally-disabled persons based on funding concerns rather than medical necessity concerns.</p><p>On July 31, 1998, the plaintiffs amended the complaint, adding four new individual plaintiffs and one institutional plaintiff, the Advocacy Center for Disabled Persons.</p><p>On January 19, 1999, the plaintiffs amended their complaint a second time to add, among other things, twelve additional individual plaintiffs and a cause of action to enforce certain sections of the Medicaid Act requiring states participating in Medicaid to provide early and periodic screening, diagnosis, and treatment to eligible persons under the age of 21.</p><p>On March 10, 1999, the Court (Judge Wilkie D. Ferguson, Jr.) granted the class certification motion.

Strom, U.S. District Judge for the District of Nebraska, sitting by\ndesignation.\n\nThis is an interlocutory appeal from a class certification order.  It also marks\nour first opportunity to explicate the circumstances in which a court of appeals\nshould exercise its discretion to accept such an appeal under Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 23(f).\nDefendants, Governor Jeb Bush and other named state officials, appeal the\ndistrict court’s order certifying a broad class of developmentally-disabled persons\neligible for Florida’s Home and Community Based Waiver Program, which\nprovides Medicaid-related services in home- and community-based settings to\nindividuals who meet certain level-of-care requirements.  All parties agree that\nsome kind of class or classes should be certified, but Defendants contend that the\nsingle class certified by the district court was too broad.  Defendants specifically\nassert that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the claims of the named class\nrepresentatives possess the requisite typicality with the claims of the class at large\nas required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  We agree and vacate the class certification\norder.  On remand, the district court must  ensure that at least one of the named\nclass representatives possesses the requisite individual or associational standing to\nbring each of the class’s legal claims. \n2\n\nI.\nA.\nThe named plaintiffs are individuals with developmental disabilities who\nmeet the level-of-care requirements of an intermediate care facility for individuals\nwith developmental disabilities (“ICF/DD”) under the Medicaid Act, Title XIX of\nthe Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396, et seq.1  Medicaid is a cooperative\nfederal-state program through which the federal government furnishes financial\nassistance to the states so that the states may provide necessary medical,\nrehabilitation, and other services to low-income persons.  At present, the federal\ngovernment pays for about 55% of the cost of Medicaid services in Florida.  State\nparticipation in Medicaid is voluntary, but participating states must comply with\n     1Under the ICF/DD program: \nEach client must receive a continuous active treatment program,\nwhich includes aggressive, consistent implementation of a program\nof specialized and generic training, treatment, health services and\nrelated services . . ., that is directed toward – \n(i) The acquisition of the behaviors necessary for the client to\nfunction  with  as  much  self  determination  and  independence  as\npossible; and \n(ii) The prevention or deceleration of regression or loss of current\noptimal functional status. \n42 C.F.R. § 483.440(a)(1)(i)-(ii) (1996).  The ICF/DD program is restricted to individuals with\nsufficiently severe mental retardation and related conditions.  It is not designed for “generally\nindependent clients who are able to function with little supervision or in the absence of a \ncontinuous active treatment program.”  42 C.F.R. § 483.440(a)(2) (1996).\n3\n\ncertain requirements imposed by the Act as well as regulations promulgated by the\nSecretary of Health and Human Services (“Secretary”).  Those provisions allow\nstate Medicaid plans to apply a “medical necessity” test to all applicants to ensure\nthat applicants receive medical services in order of need.  However, state plans are\nrequired to provide “an opportunity for a fair hearing before the State agency to\nany individual whose claim for medical assistance under the plan is denied or is not\nacted upon with reasonable promptness.”  42 U.S.C. § 1396(a)(3); see also 42\nC.F.R. § 431.200, et seq. \nUnder the Home and Community Based Services Waiver Act, Title XIX of\nthe Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c), Congress has authorized certain\npersons with developmental disabilities to receive Medicaid services in a\ncommunity setting rather than in an institutional facility.  The Act empowers the\nSecretary to grant a waiver to a state under which approved costs of home- and\ncommunity-based services are reimbursed for eligible individuals who otherwise\nwould require care in an ICF/DD facility, but who instead elect to remain in their\nhomes.  42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c).  To qualify for a waiver, a state must develop\nalternative regulatory schemes aimed at lowering the cost of medical assistance\n4\n\nwhile still maintaining the same level of care.2  Florida has chosen to participate in\nthe Medicaid Home and Community Based Waiver Program.3  \nB.\nOn May 13, 1998, two of the named plaintiffs, Wolf Prado-Steiman and\nMarlon Christie, filed a class action lawsuit alleging that various Florida state\nofficials in their official capacity, including the Governor and the Secretary of the\nDepartment of Children and Families, have acted unlawfully in their governance of\nFlorida’s Home and Community Based Medicaid Waiver Program.  Plaintiffs\nallege violations of the American with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq.;\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794; Title XIX of the\nSocial Security Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a, et seq., 1396n, et seq., and 42 C.F.R. §\n431.200; the Due Process Clause; and 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Specifically, Plaintiffs\ncontend that, contrary to federal law, state officials routinely deny or provide\nwithout reasonable promptness critical “Home and Community Based Waiver”\n     2Although the Waiver Act excuses states from satisfying all of the Medicaid Act’s requirements,\nsee 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(3), it does not authorize the Secretary to waive any sections of the\nMedicaid Act governing the health, safety, or welfare of Medicaid recipients.  Moreover, the\nSecretary may not grant a waiver unless a state provides assurances that its waiver plan includes\n“necessary safeguards” to protect the health and welfare of individuals provided services under the\nwaiver.  42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(2)(A).\n     3Florida’s Home and Community Based Waiver Program is outlined in detail at Fla. Admin.\nCode § 59G-8.200.  The specific provisions of this Program are not at issue in this appeal.\n5\n\n(“HCBW”) services for Medicaid-eligible, developmentally-disabled persons\nbased on funding concerns rather than medical necessity concerns.4  \nPlaintiffs assert that as a result of this policy many developmentally-disabled\npersons who desire HCBW services have been forced to reside in institutional\nfacilities in order to receive Medicaid services.  Plaintiffs also allege that\nDefendants systematically deny Medicaid-eligible, developmentally-disabled\npersons who apply for HCBW services the procedural due process protections\nrequired by the Medicaid Act, including notice of their right to appeal adverse\ndecisions and to continue receiving benefits pending appeal, as well as the\nopportunity for a fair hearing if their claims are denied or not acted upon with\nreasonable promptness.5  Plaintiffs seek, among other things, declaratory and\n     4In Doe v. Chiles, we held that a “federal right to reasonably prompt provision of assistance\nunder section 1396a(a)(8) of the Medicaid Act” exists, and “that this right is enforceable under\nsection 1983.”  136 F.3d 709, 719 (11th Cir. 1998).  Under section 1396a(a)(8), “[a] State plan for\nmedical assistance must . . . provide that all individuals wishing to make application for medical\nassistance under the plan shall have opportunity to do so, and that such assistance shall be furnished\nwith reasonable promptness to all eligible individuals.”  42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8).  A corresponding\nfederal regulation requires that the responsible state agency “[f]urnish Medicaid promptly to\nrecipients without any delay caused by the agency’s administrative procedures,” and “[c]ontinue to\nfurnish Medicaid regularly to all eligible individuals until they are found to be ineligible.” 42 C.F.R.\n§ 435.930(a)-(b) (1996).\n     5Federal Medicaid regulations provide that a state “must establish time standards for determining\neligibility and inform the applicant of what they are.”  42 C.F.R. § 435.911(a) (1996). These periods\nare not to exceed “[n]inety days for applicants who apply for Medicaid on the basis of disability”\nor “[f]orty-five days for all other applicants.” 42 C.F.R. § 435.911(a)(1)-(2) (1996). In addition, the\nstate “must not use the time standard” as “a waiting period.” 42 C.F.R. § 435.911(e)(1) (1996).\n6\n\ninjunctive relief which would require Defendants to provide necessary HCBW\nservices to eligible persons and to comply with Medicaid procedural requirements\nin their adjudication and denial of HCBW services. \nOn July 31, 1998, Plaintiffs amended the complaint by right, adding four\nnew individual plaintiffs, Lucy Adawi, Jennifer Batsidas, Daniel Lavin, and Daniel\nShell, and one institutional plaintiff, the Advocacy Center for Disabled Persons,\nInc.  Plaintiffs then moved for class certification.  On January 19, 1999, Plaintiffs\nsought to amend their complaint a second time to add, among other things, twelve\nfurther individual plaintiffs as well as a cause of action to enforce certain sections\nof the Medicaid Act requiring states participating in Medicaid to provide early and\nperiodic screening, diagnosis, and treatment (“EPSDT”) to eligible persons under\nthe age of 21.  On February 19, 1999, the court held a hearing on Plaintiffs’ motion\nfor class certification at which it apparently granted Plaintiffs’ request to file the\nsecond amended complaint.  \nIn March 1999, the district court granted the class certification motion.  It\nidentified as class representatives all seven of the plaintiffs named in the first\namended complaint, but declined to identify as class representatives the twelve\n7\n\nnew plaintiffs added in the second amended complaint until Defendants could\ncomplete discovery.6  The court defined the class as follows:\n     6The First Amended Complaint named six individual plaintiff class representatives -- Wolf\nPrado-Steiman, Lucy Adawi, Marlon Christie, Daniel Lavin, Jennifer Batsidas and Daniel Shell --\nand one institutional plaintiff class representative -- the Advocacy Center for Persons with\nDisabilities, Inc.  Four of the individual plaintiffs -- Prado-Steiman, Adawi, Christie, and Lavin --\nhave applied for HCBW services but have been denied coverage.  The other two individual plaintiffs\n-- Batsidas and Shell -- currently receive HCBW services they allege are inadequate.\nThe following facts pertain to each named plaintiff:\n(1) Wolf Prado-Steiman \nWolf is an eight year-old autistic boy who lives at home with his family.  There is no dispute\nthat he suffers from severe behavioral problems as a result of his disability.  Plaintiffs contend that\nWolf, having no assets or income, would be eligible for a HCBW waiver.  He has applied for HCBW\nservices and received no written determination on his claim.  After this suit was filed, Defendants\nagreed to pay for 12 behavioral therapy sessions.  In an institutional setting, his care would be on-\ngoing.  \n(2) Lucy Adawi\nLucy is a fifty year-old mildly retarded woman with a schizoaffective disorder who lives\nwith her 80 year-old mother.  She applied for HCBW services but has received only $44 of\nnecessary medical supplies\n(3) Marlon Christie\nMarlon Christie is an 18 year-old man with cerebral palsy who must sleep on the floor\nbecause he lacks an appropriate bed at home.  He applied for HCBW services but was told there is\na long waiting list and no available services.\n(4) Daniel Lavin\nDaniel Lavin is a 22 year-old man with severe mental retardation and cerebral palsy who\nneeds bathroom modifications to make the room handicap-accessible.  He applied for HCBW\nservices but has received no services as yet due to his low priority rating on the waiting list.  He has\nnot received written notice of a denial of his request.\n(5) Jennifer Batsidas \n8\n\n[A]ll persons with developmental disabilities who are\npresently receiving Home and Community-Based Waiver\nServices or who are eligible to receive Home and\nCommunity-Based Waiver Services, or who would \nreceive or be eligible for Home and Community-Based\nWaiver Services in the future.\nThe district court also identified ten substantive, classwide claims:\na.  whether Defendants have violated the ADA by\ndenying individuals, who live in their own homes or with\ntheir families in community settings, services such as\nphysical therapy, speech therapy, and dental services that\nare available to individuals who are ICF/DD’s;\nb.  whether Defendants have violated the ADA by\nengaging in diagnosis-based decision-making with their\nactions to deny or limit access to benefits, services, and\nopportunities because a person has a particular disability;\nc. whether Defendants have violated § 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act of 1973;\nJennifer Batsidas is a quadriplegic with cerebral palsy.  She applied for HCBW services in\nJanuary 1998 and was not placed on a waiver until October 1998 due to a lack of state funds.  She\nreceived these funds only after a district coordinator identified her needs as “critical.”  She presently\nreceives funds on a “funds available basis.” She alleges that the vocational services she receives\nfrom the HCBW Program are inadequate.\n(6) Daniel Shell\nDaniel Shell is a 32 year-old man with moderate mental retardation and cerebral palsy\ncurrently receiving HCBW services in the form of a vocational service workshop.  He allegedly has\nbeen denied physical therapy equipment recommended by his physician to treat his movement\ndisorder.  The equipment was requested in March 1998 and a hearing was not scheduled until\nJanuary 1999.  No hearing decision has yet been made.  Shell alleges the services currently provided\nto him are inadequate.\n9\n\nd.  whether Defendants have violated the Medicaid\nstatute’s requirement of reasonable promptness, 42\nU.S.C. § 1396a(8) and 42 U.S.C. § 1983, by failing to\nprovide Medicaid Waiver Services with reasonable\npromptness;\ne.   whether Defendants have violated 42 U.S.C. § 1396n\nand 42 U.S.C. § 1983, by providing inadequate and\ninappropriate Home and Community-Based Waiver\nServices;\nf.   whether Defendants have violated 42 U.S.C. § 1396n\nand 42 U.S.C. § 1983, by funding institutional\nplacements using Home and Community-Based Waiver\nServices;\ng. whether Defendants have violated 42 U.S.C. §\n1396n(c)(2) and 42 U.S.C. § 1983, by denying Plaintiffs\ntheir freedom of choice of an appropriate Home and\nCommunity-Based Waiver program that meets their\nhealth and welfare needs;\nh. whether Defendants have violated Medicaid’s\nstatewideness requirement, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(1), and\n42 U.S.C. § 1983, by failing to provide Home and\nCommunity-Based Waiver services throughout the State\nof Florida;\ni.   whether Defendants have violated Medicaid’s EPSDT\nrequirements, violated 42 U.S.C. § 1396(a)(43)(C) and\n42 U.S.C. § 1983, by failing to provide needed EPSDT\nservices directly and to ensure that there are providers\nwho are qualified and willing to provide EPSDT services\nfor children with developmental disabilities;\nj.  whether Defendants have violated the Due Process\nClause of the U.S. Constitution and 42 U.S.C. § 1983, by\ndenying Plaintiffs and class members procedural due\n10\n\nprocess, including notice and the opportunity for a fair\nhearing to challenge denials, reductions, and termination\nof Home and Community-Based Waiver benefits.\nApplying the prerequisites for class certification required by Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 23(a), the district court concluded:  first, that there were over\n20,000 estimated class members, satisfying Rule 23(a)(1) numerosity’s\nrequirement; second, that there was sufficient commonality between the questions\nof law and fact posed by the class suit despite the class members’ varying medical\nconditions, satisfying Rule 23(a)(2)’s commonality requirement; third, that there\nwas a sufficient nexus between these common questions of law and fact and the\nnamed representatives’ claims, satisfying Rule 23(a)(3)’s typicality requirement;\nand finally, that the named representatives satisfied Rule 23(a)(4)’s adequacy of\nrepresentation requirement.  The district court also concluded that class status was\nwarranted under Rule 23(b)(2) because the class requested injunctive relief and\nDefendants had generally refused to act on grounds applicable to the class. \n Defendants then petitioned our court pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 23(f) for an interlocutory appeal of the district court’s class certification\norder.  We granted that petition on May 12, 1999, having taken into account the\nmatters set forth below.\nII.\n11\n\nWe start by discussing Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f), which allows\nfederal courts of appeals to hear an interlocutory appeal of a district court’s order\ngranting or denying class certification.  The Rule, which became effective on\nDecember 1, 1998, reads as follows:\nA court of appeals may in its discretion permit an appeal\nfrom an order of a district court granting or denying class\naction certification under this rule if application is made\nto it within ten days after entry of the order.  An appeal\ndoes not stay proceedings in the district court unless the\ndistrict judge or the court of appeals so orders. \n Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(f).  This case is the first published opinion in this circuit, and\none of the first in the nation, to address the standards to be used when evaluating a\nRule 23(f) petition.  Thus far, only the First and Seventh Circuits have explored\nthis question in detail.  See Waste Management Holdings, Inc. v. Mowbray, 208\nF.3d 288 (1st Cir. 2000); Blair v. Equifax Check Services, Inc., 181 F.3d 832 (7th\nCir. 1999).  We therefore begin our discussion with background on Rule 23(f), and\nthen set forth some guideposts for evaluating when we should permit a Rule 23(f)\nappeal.\nA.\nA good starting point is the Committee Note accompanying Rule 23(f),\nwhich articulates the drafters’ view of how courts should resolve petitions for\nappeal under this new rule.  The Note emphasizes that “the court of appeals is\n12\n\ngiven unfettered discretion whether to permit the appeal, akin to the discretion\nexercised by the Supreme Court in acting on a petition for certiorari. . . . \nPermission to appeal may be granted or denied on the basis of any consideration\nthat the court of appeals finds persuasive.”  Id.  The Note then observes that\n“[p]ermission [to appeal] is most likely to be granted when the certification\ndecision turns on a novel or unsettled question of law, or when, as a practical\nmatter, the decision on certification is likely dispositive of the litigation.”  Id. \nAccording to the Note:\n  [M]any suits with class-action allegations present\nfamiliar and almost routine issues that are no more\nworthy of immediate appeal than many other\ninterlocutory rulings. Yet several concerns justify\nexpansion of present opportunities to appeal.  An order\ndenying certification may confront the plaintiff with a\nsituation in which the only sure path to appellate review\nis by proceeding to final judgment on the merits of an\nindividual claim that, standing alone, is far smaller than\nthe costs of litigation. An order granting certification, on\nthe other hand, may force a defendant to settle rather than\nincur the costs of defending a class action and run the\nrisk of potentially ruinous liability.\nId.  \nAs summarized by the First Circuit, Rule 23(f) serves two key purposes: \nfirst, to provide a “mechanism through which appellate courts, in the interests of\nfairness, can restore equilibrium when a doubtful class certification ruling would\n13\n\nvirtually compel a party to abandon a potentially meritorious claim or defense\nbefore trial”; and second, to “furnish[] an avenue, if the need is sufficiently acute,\nwhereby the court of appeals can take earlier-than-usual cognizance of important,\nunsettled legal questions, thus contributing to both the orderly progress of complex\nlitigation and the orderly development of the law.”  Mowbray, 208 F.3d at 293.  \nBased on these purposes, the Seventh Circuit in Blair outlined three\ncategories of cases for which Rule 23(f) review may be appropriate.  As\nsummarized in Mowbray:\n  First, an appeal ordinarily should be permitted when a\ndenial of class status effectively ends the case (because,\nsay, the named plaintiff’s claim is not of a sufficient\nmagnitude to warrant the costs of stand-alone litigation).\nSecond, an appeal ordinarily should be permitted when\nthe grant of class status raises the stakes of the litigation\nso substantially that the defendant likely will feel\nirresistible pressure to settle. Third, an appeal ordinarily\nshould be permitted when it will lead to clarification of a\nfundamental issue of law.\nId.  \nThe Seventh Circuit put additional gloss on these three broad categories.  It\nexplained that a petitioner who sought to invoke either of the first two categories\nalso would have to “demonstrate that the district court’s ruling on class\ncertification is questionable -- and must do this taking into account the discretion\nthe district judge possesses in implementing Rule 23, and the correspondingly\n14\n\ndeferential standard of appellate review.”  Blair, 181 F.3d at 835.  The court further\nobserved that when reviewing petitions invoking the third and final category, it\nwould focus on the importance of the issue to be resolved, more so than the\nlikelihood of reversal.  See id.  Finally, it noted that even when an application touts\na supposedly fundamental issue of law, a showing that an end-of-case appeal\npromises to be an adequate remedy will weigh heavily against granting a Rule\n23(f) application.  See id.\nRecently, the First Circuit adopted Blair’s Rule 23(f) taxonomy as\n“structurally sound” with one notable caveat.  Mowbray, 208 F.3d at 294.  The \nMowbray court worried, we think rightly, that the third Blair category might\n“encourage too many disappointed litigants to file fruitless Rule 23(f) applications”\nsince “a creative lawyer almost always will be able to argue that deciding her case\nwould clarify some ‘fundamental’ issue.”   Id.  The First Circuit then emphasized\nthat “interlocutory appeals should be the exception, not the rule” because “many (if\nnot most) class certification decisions turn on ‘familiar and almost routine issues.’”\nId. (citing Comm. Note, Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(f)).  As a result, the Mowbray court\nconcluded that “Blair’s third category should be restricted to those instances in\nwhich an appeal will permit the resolution of an unsettled legal issue that is\n15\n\nimportant to the particular litigation as well as important in itself and likely to\nescape effective review if left hanging until the end of the case.”  Id.\nWe find both the Blair and Mowbray opinions to be cogent explications of\nthe Rule 23(f) inquiry.  We think it important, however, to emphasize some\nadditional considerations that may weigh against frequent interlocutory appellate\nreview of class action certification decisions.  \nTo begin with, there are too many class actions filed each year for federal\nappeals courts practicably to adjudicate class certification decisions on an\ninterlocutory basis as a matter of course.  As a statistical point of reference, we\nobserve that according to the Federal Judicial Center, as of 1998 there were 1,742\nactive federal cases with class action activity.  In 1994, there were only 816 such\ncases.  A similar rise is reported for this Circuit; in 1998, according to the data,\nthere were 221 active cases in this Circuit with class action activity, almost double\nthe number of such cases, 114, during 1994.7  Given these numbers, and the large\nvolume of ordinary final judgments that by law must be considered by the courts of\nappeals, routinely granting interlocutory appellate review of class certification\ndecisions is simply not practicable.\n     7These figures are not published in printed form, but are derived from information in the\ndatabases of the Federal Judicial Center in Washington, D.C.\n16\n\nThere are also powerful case management concerns that caution against\nroutinely granting appellate review in these circumstances.  Class certification\norders also are not final judgments impervious to lower court review and revision. \nOn the contrary, Rule 23(c)(1) specifically empowers district courts to alter or\namend class certification orders at any time prior to a decision on the merits.  That\npower is critical, because the scope and contour of a class may change radically as\ndiscovery progresses and more information is gathered about the nature of the\nputative class members’ claims.8  Indeed, Rule 23 contemplates that the class\ncertification decision will be made prior to the close of discovery.  Fed. R. Civ. P.\n23(c)(1) (class status should be resolved “[a]s soon as practicable after the\ncommencement of” the action); see also Armstrong v. Martin Marietta Corp., 138\nF.3d 1374, 1389 (11th Cir. 1998) (en banc) (citing data showing that most class\ncertification decisions are made in the early stages of the litigation).  Rule 23(f)\nshould not be a vehicle for courts of appeals to micro-manage complex class action\nlitigation as it unfolds in the district court.  \nMoreover, interlocutory appellate review of a class certification decision\nmay short-circuit the district court’s ability -- or at least willingness -- to exercise\n     8Rule 23(f) states expressly that an appeal under this provision does not stay proceedings in the\ndistrict court unless the district court or the court of appeals so orders.  Thus, Rule 23(f)\ncontemplates that in most cases discovery (at the very least, merits discovery) will continue\nnotwithstanding the pendency of an appeal of the class certification order.\n17\n\nits power to reconsider its certification decision.  If a decision on class certification\nhas been fully reviewed and affirmed on an interlocutory basis, both the parties and\nthe district judge may feel constrained from revisiting the issue and thereby\npotentially triggering a new round of appellate proceedings with the inevitable\ndelay and effort of such proceedings.  This possibility is troubling, because class\ncertification determinations are so fluid and fact-sensitive that district courts\nshould be encouraged rather than discouraged from reassessing whether the\nprerequisites of Rule 23 exist and whether a class action is the most efficacious\nway to resolve the dispute.  Quite simply, “[w]e should err, if at all, on the side of\nallowing the district court an opportunity to fine-tune its class certification order\nrather than opening the door too widely to interlocutory appellate review.” \nMowbray, 208 F.3d at 294 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1)) (internal citation\nomitted).\nFinally, authorizing interlocutory review simply on the basis of a so-called\n“fundamental” or “unsettled” question of law sets a difficult precedent.  We share\nthe First Circuit’s concern over encouraging a flood of Rule 23(f) petitions\nclaiming that such a question is in dispute.  Given the stakes of class action\nlitigation, and the vast number of persons affected, many routine issues have the\npotential to take on substantial proportions and assume an importance they\n18\n\notherwise might not.  Moreover, given the highly particularized nature of class\naction determinations, and the lack of case law applying Rule 23 in many contexts,\nwe imagine it relatively easy for a litigant to identify some question of law\nimplicated by the class certification decision and in good faith characterize that\nquestion as novel or unsettled.  To justify immediate and interlocutory appellate\nreview, something more is necessary -- something that creates a compelling need\nfor resolution of the legal issue sooner rather than later.\nTaking into account all of these considerations, the following guideposts\nmay be utilized in determining whether to grant an interlocutory appeal under Rule\n23(f).  \nFirst, and most important, the court should examine whether the district\ncourt’s ruling is likely dispositive of the litigation by creating a “death knell” for\neither plaintiff or defendant.  The prospect of irreparable harm from delaying\nappellate review of the class certification decision until after final judgment\nundoubtedly creates a compelling need for immediate review.  Nevertheless, even\nordinary class certification decisions by their very nature may radically reshape a\nlawsuit and significantly alter the risk-benefit calculation of the parties, leading to\nclaims of irreparable harm.  For that reason, the decision to grant interlocutory\nreview based primarily on this factor generally should be limited to those cases\n19\n\nwhere the district court’s ruling, as a practical matter, effectively prevents the\npetitioner from pursuing the litigation.  This might be the case where a denial of\nclass status means that the stakes are too low for the named plaintiffs to continue\nthe matter, or where the grant of class status raises the cost and stakes of the\nlitigation so substantially that a rational defendant would feel irresistible pressure\nto settle.  The size of the putative class and any record evidence regarding the\nfinancial resources of the parties are relevant to this inquiry.  Also relevant,\nespecially when a class has been certified in a mass tort case against a corporate\ndefendant, is the existence and potential impact of related litigation against that\ndefendant.  The nature of the remedy sought in the case (and in damages cases, the\namount of money potentially recoverable) is likewise relevant to this factor.  For\nexample, even a large class seeking declaratory or injunctive relief may create less\npressure on a defendant than a class seeking compensatory and punitive damages\nso substantial that they threaten a defendant’s solvency.  We anticipate that the\nnumber of decisions truly warranting immediate review on this basis alone will be\nsmall. \nSecond, a court should consider whether the petitioner has shown a\nsubstantial weakness in the class certification decision, such that the decision likely\nconstitutes an abuse of discretion.  Ordinarily, the appropriateness of allowing a\n20\n\nRule 23(f) appeal should turn on more than the outcome of a preliminary debate\nabout the merits of the district court’s ruling.  Interlocutory review may be\nappropriate when it promises to spare the parties and the district court the expense\nand burden of litigating the matter to final judgment only to have it inevitably\nreversed by this Court on an appeal after final judgment.  Such a situation may\nexist, for example, when the district court expressly applies the incorrect Rule 23\nstandard or overlooks directly controlling precedent.  Cf. Rutstein v. Avis Rent-A-\nCar Sys., Inc., 211 F.3d 1228, 1234-35 (11th Cir. 2000) (granting Rule 23(f)\npetition and reversing order granting class certification where in light of a prior\nEleventh Circuit opinion “we do not see how plaintiffs can maintain a class action\nunder Rule 23(b)(3) in the instant case”).  In that situation, interlocutory review\nmay be warranted even if none of the other factors supports granting the Rule 23(f)\npetition.9  Typically, however, class certification decisions require the application\nof broad and flexible legal standards to unique and complex sets of facts that do\n     9The more the alleged error arises out of a mistake of law (as opposed to an improper application\nof the law to the facts), the more the case may be susceptible to interlocutory review, simply because\nsuch an error is more readily reviewable by this Court and does not require us to base our\ndetermination on an evolving factual record that may already have become incomplete.  See\nSunAmerica Corp. v. Sun Life Assur. Co., 77 F.3d 1325, 1333 (11th Cir. 1996) (court necessarily\nabuses its discretion if it “has applied an incorrect legal standard”); see also Pickett v. Iowa Beef\nProcessors, 209 F.3d 1276, 1279 (11th Cir. 2000) (granting Rule 23(f) petition and applying de novo\nstandard to reverse district court’s interpretation of the adequacy-of-representation test of Rule\n23(a)(4)).\n21\n\nnot fit squarely within prior precedent.  Due to the highly fact-sensitive nature of\nthis inquiry, district courts are given wide latitude to decide whether and how to\ncertify a class, and appellate scrutiny of such decisions is limited at any stage. \nAccordingly, merely demonstrating that the district court’s ruling is questionable\ngenerally will be insufficient to support a Rule 23(f) petition in the absence of\nother factors supporting immediate review.  See Armstrong, 138 F.3d at 1386\n(“class certification decisions are left to the sound discretion of the district court,\nand in most cases the certification order can be effectively reviewed on appeal after\nfinal judgment”) (internal citation omitted).10\nThird, a court should consider whether the appeal will permit the resolution\nof an unsettled legal issue that is “important to the particular litigation as well as\nimportant in itself.”  Mowbray, 208 F.3d at 294.  Such an issue might be one that is\nof moment yet is “likely to escape effective review if left hanging until the end of\nthe case.”  Id.  Alternatively, the issue might be one as to which an appellate ruling\n     10We do not mean to suggest that this factor weighs in favor of a Rule 23(f) appeal only when\nthe party seeking interlocutory review meets the extremely demanding test applied to mandamus\npetitions.  See Armstrong, 138 F.3d at 1386 (prior to Rule 23(f) court would issue writ of mandamus\nto direct district judge to take particular action regarding a class certification ruling only when the\n“certification order constitutes, at a minimum, a clear abuse of discretion”).  Rather, this factor\nshould be viewed as a sliding scale.  The stronger the showing of an abuse of discretion, the more\nthis factor weighs in favor of interlocutory review.  We note, however, that every litigant seeking\nto appeal under Rule 23(f) necessarily believes that the district court has abused its discretion.\nAccordingly, simply alleging an abuse of discretion may not in and of itself justify an interlocutory\nappeal.\n22\n\nsooner rather than later will substantially assist the bench and bar, as may be the\ncase when an issue is arising simultaneously in related actions involving the same\nor similarly-situated parties or is one that seems likely to arise repeatedly in the\nfuture.  The fact that the lawsuit involves a governmental entity, or has a strong\npublic interest component, may also lend the issue particular importance and\nurgency.  Moreover, interlocutory review under Rule 23(f) seems more appropriate\nif the unsettled issue relates specifically to the requirements of Rule 23 or the\nmechanics of certifying a class, given that one of the primary justifications for Rule\n23(f) was a concern over the perceived lack of a substantial body of case law\naddressing the Rule 23 standards.  See Blair, 181 F.3d at 835.  We reiterate,\nhowever, that a class certification decision which “turns on case-specific matters of\nfact and district court discretion,”  Comm. Note, Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 -- as most\ncertification decisions indisputably do -- generally will not be appropriate for\ninterlocutory review.\nFourth, a court should consider the nature and status of the litigation before\nthe district court.  Some cases plainly will be in a better pre-trial posture for\ninterlocutory appellate review than others.  As noted above, the propriety of\ngranting or denying a class, as well as the proper scope of any class that has been\ngranted, may change significantly as new facts are uncovered through discovery. \n23\n\nSimilarly, a limited or insufficient record may adversely affect the appellate court’s\nability to evaluate fully and fairly the class certification decision.  Moreover, a\ndistrict court’s ruling on dispositive motions or a motion to add new class\nrepresentatives, parties, or claims may significantly redefine the issues in the case\nand thereby affect the scope of or need for a class.  Accordingly, the decision on a\nRule 23(f) petition may take into account such considerations as the status of\ndiscovery, the pendency of relevant motions, and the length of time the matter\nalready has been pending.  In certain circumstances the court may also consider the\ncurrent impact on the parties of rulings by the district court that, while not\nthemselves subject to Rule 23(f) review, nevertheless are inextricably tied to the\nclass certification decision.  Cf. Jackson v. Motel 6 Multipurpose, Inc., 130 F.3d\n999, 1007-08 (11th Cir. 1997) (reviewing petitions for writ of mandamus that\nchallenged class certification decision as well as district court’s order allowing\nhighly prejudicial advertising and mass mailings to putative class members), reh’g\ndenied, 167 F.3d 542 (1998).\nFinally, a court should consider the likelihood that future events may make\nimmediate appellate review more or less appropriate.  Simply by way of example,\nsettlement negotiations involving some or all of the parties affected by the\ndecision, or the prospect of an imminent change in the financial status of a party\n24\n\n(such as a bankruptcy filing) may caution against hearing an interlocutory appeal. \nConversely, if the case is likely to be one of a series of related actions raising\nsubstantially the same issues and involving substantially the same parties, then\nearly resolution of a dispute about the propriety of certifying a class may facilitate\nthe disposition of future claims.  Also significant is whether the district court itself\nhas indicated that it views its class certification decision as conditional or subject\nto revision at a later stage in the case. \nWe do not create any bright-line rules or rigid categories for accepting or\ndenying Rule 23(f) petitions today.  Our authority to accept Rule 23(f) petitions is\nhighly discretionary, and the foregoing list of factors is not intended to be\nexhaustive; there may well be special circumstances that lead us to grant or deny a\nRule 23(f) petition even where some or all of the relevant factors point to a\ndifferent result.  Moreover, none of the foregoing factors is necessarily conclusive;\nordinarily, each relevant factor should be balanced against the others, taking into\naccount any unique facts and circumstances. \nWe reiterate, however, that interlocutory appeals are inherently “disruptive,\ntime-consuming, and expensive,” Mowbray, 208 F.3d at 294, and consequently are\ngenerally disfavored.  Piecemeal appellate review has a deleterious effect on\njudicial administration.  It increases the workload of the appellate courts, to the\n25\n\ndetriment of litigants and judges.  It requires the appellate courts to consider issues\nthat may be rendered moot if the appealing party ultimately prevails in or settles\nthe case.  It undermines the district court’s ability to manage the action.  And it\ncreates opportunities for abuse by litigants seeking to delay resolution of a case by\nraising with the appellate court objections to the scope of an order that should have\nbeen raised first with the district court itself.  Most of these concerns are, if\nanything, even more compelling in the class action context, especially given the\ndistrict court’s broad authority under Rule 23(c)(1) to monitor and if necessary\nreconsider its class certification decision as discovery unfolds and the action\nprogresses to trial.  \nWe will therefore use restraint in accepting Rule 23(f) petitions, and these\ninterlocutory petitions will not be accepted as a matter of course. \nB.\nTurning to the particulars of this case, we acknowledge that this lawsuit may\nnot raise the kind of issues that ordinarily might warrant granting a Rule 23(f)\npetition.  First, we do not believe the grant of class status here raises the stakes of\nlitigation so substantially that the Defendants likely will feel irresistible pressure to\nsettle.  The certified Plaintiff class, while large, is only seeking declaratory and\ninjunctive relief (not money damages).  As a result, the size of the certified class, in\n26\n\nthis particular case, does not place tremendous economic pressure on Defendants. \nAnd while an award of injunctive and declaratory relief would exert a significant\nimpact on the administration of the state HCBW program, Defendants’\ninterlocutory appeal does not concern the scope of this potential relief. \nSecond, while we agree with Defendants that the district court would have\nbeen wiser to certify several subclasses rather than one large class, see infra Part\nIII, Defendants do not demonstrate any substantial weakness or profound error of\nlaw in the class certification decision.  Though in passing Defendants challenge the\nclass certification language as vague, they do not argue that a HCBW class should\nnot have been certified; indeed, they propose that the district court should have\ncertified two HCBW classes.  Consequently, because both parties agree that some\nkind of HCBW class(es) should be certified in this case, the issues raised on appeal\nare not dispositive of the litigation.11  Moreover, much of the vagueness of the\n     11In their brief, Defendants argue that the district court should have certified the following two\nHCBW classes:\nClass One.  All persons with developmental disabilities who have\napplied for services which are compensable under the Florida Home\nand Community Based Waiver and who have been determined to be\neligible for services but who have not received them with reasonable\npromptness.\nClass Two.  All persons with developmental disabilities who have\napplied  for  services  compensable  under  the  Florida  Home  and\nCommunity Based Waiver but who have been denied them without\nnotice and opportunity for hearing.\n27\n\ndistrict court’s order relates to its inclusion of persons who will be eligible for or\nwill receive HCBW services in the future; while such language would have serious\nimplications in a class action seeking monetary damages, it is of little moment in\nthis case because the certified class only seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.12 \nDefendants’ objection that Plaintiffs have not as yet demonstrated that a\nnamed class representative possesses individual or associational standing to bring\neach of the class’s subclaims is of greater moment.  But although we agree that at\nleast one named representative must have standing to bring each class subclaim,\nsee infra Part III, this argument should have been raised squarely with the district\ncourt rather than for the first time in a Rule 23(f) petition.13  Outside the Rule 23(f)\ncontext, issues of standing are normally not available for review on interlocutory\nappeal.  See Summit Medical Assocs. v. Pryor, 180 F.3d 1326, 1334 (11th Cir.\n1999).  \n     12We agree with Defendants that the class certification order does not offer a precise definition\nof what it means to be “eligible” for HCBW services.  However, whether the term includes those\nwho have applied for HCBW services or rather all people residing in Florida who meet the ICF/DD\nlevel-of-care criteria only really affects the size of the class.  Because money damages are not sought\nby this class, such a definitional problem is less significant at this time.\n     13In their motion to dismiss, Defendants did raise a standing-related issue; however, they did not\ncontest the individual standing of the named plaintiffs to raise their proposed class claims.  Instead,\nDefendants merely argued that Plaintiffs had not demonstrated that they were likely to suffer injury\nat the hands of the named Defendants because the state officials named, for example, then-Governor\nLawton Chiles, lacked official responsibility over the state Medicaid program.\n28\n\nExtensive interlocutory review of Defendants’ standing objection seems\nparticularly inappropriate given the circumstances of this case.  First, the factual\nrecord is not fully developed -- making resolution of individual standing claims\nimpossible.  Second, even if Defendants’ argument were completely correct, at\nworst several new named representatives would have to be added to the class or\nseveral of the class subclaims would have to be amended or dropped.  Simply put,\nDefendants’ standing argument does not end the case; and given the fluid nature of\nclass certification rulings and the ability of the district court to alter or amend the\ncertified class at any point prior to a ruling on the merits, see Fed. R. Civ. P.\n23(c)(1), we believe such standing challenges are best raised initially with the\ndistrict court rather than as the predicate for an appeal under Rule 23(f).\nOther Rule 23(f) factors might also weigh against interlocutory review were\nthis an ordinary case.  We see no truly novel or fundamental issue of law raised by\nthe class certification decision.  As discussed above, the scope and nature of this\nclass may be affected by matters still subject to discovery and fact development. \nOn the other hand, this lawsuit has tremendous importance to thousands of\ndevelopmentally-disabled persons in the State of Florida, many of whom have a\ncritical need for prompt delivery of the services and benefits they claim to have\nbeen denied by the State.  There is also a broader but no less compelling public\n29\n\ninterest in determining promptly the scope of the State’s administrative and\nfinancial obligations under the Medicaid program with respect to such persons. \nGiven these considerations, as well as the fact that we have not previously\nenunciated Rule 23(f) standards and the merits of this appeal have already been\nbriefed and oral argument heard, we proceed to address certain aspects of the class\ncertification ruling -- particularly with respect to the creation of subclasses and\ntypicality review.\nIII.\nWe review orders granting class certification for abuse of discretion.  See\nKendrick v. Jefferson County Bd. of Educ., 932 F.2d 910, 914 (11th Cir. 1991)\n(citing Walker v. Jim Dandy Co., 747 F.2d 1360, 1363 (11th Cir.1984)).   Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 23(a) requires, as a condition precedent to class certification, that four\nprerequisites be met.  The Rule states: \n(a) Prerequisites to a Class Action.  One or more\nmembers of a class may sue or be sued as representative\nparties on behalf of all only if (1) the class is so\nnumerous that joinder of all members is impracticable,\n(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the\nclass, (3) the claims or defenses of the representative\nparties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class,\nand (4) the representative parties will fairly and\nadequately protect the interests of the class.\n30\n\nId.  These four requirements commonly are referred to as the prerequisites of\nnumerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation, see General\nTelephone Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 156, 102 S. Ct. 2364, 2370,\n72 L. Ed. 2d 740 (1982); Appleyard v. Wallace, 754 F.2d 955, 958 (11th Cir.\n1985), and they are designed to effectively limit class claims to those “‘fairly\nencompassed’” by the named plaintiffs’ individual claims,  Falcon, 457 U.S. at\n156, 102 S. Ct. at 2370 (citation omitted).  In this case, Defendants argue that the\ncertified class does not satisfy the commonality and typicality requirements\nbecause there are several classwide legal claims for which no named plaintiff\npossesses Article III standing.\n     In many ways, the commonality and typicality requirements of Rule 23(a)\noverlap.  Both requirements focus on whether a sufficient nexus exists between the\nlegal claims of the named class representatives and those of individual class\nmembers to warrant class certification.  See Washington v. Brown & Williamson\nTobacco Co., 959 F.2d 1566, 1569 n.8 (11th Cir. 1992) (citing Falcon, 457 U.S. at\n157 n.13, 102 S. Ct. at 2370 n.13); Appleyard, 754 F.2d at 958 (citing De La\nFuente v. Stokely-Van Camp, Inc., 713 F.2d 225 (7th Cir.1983)); see also 7 C.\nWright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1764 (1972).  Traditionally,\ncommonality refers to the group characteristics of the class as a whole and\n31\n\ntypicality refers to the individual characteristics of the named plaintiff in relation to\nthe class.  See Baby Neal v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 56 (3rd Cir. 1994).  These\nrequirements “serve as guideposts for determining whether under the particular\ncircumstances maintenance of a class action is economical and whether the named\nplaintiff’s claim and the class claims are so interrelated that the interests of the\nclass members will be fairly and adequately protected in their absence.”  Falcon,\n457 U.S. at 157 n.13.14\nIt should be obvious that there cannot be adequate typicality between a class\nand a named representative unless the named representative has individual standing\nto raise the legal claims of the class.  As noted above, typicality measures whether\na sufficient nexus exists between the claims of the named representatives and those\nof the class at large.  Without individual standing to raise a legal claim, a named\n     14Neither of these requirements requires that “all putative class members share identical claims.”\nBaby Neal, 43 F.3d at 56.  Previously, we have explained that these requirements may be satisfied\neven if some factual differences exist between the claims of the named representatives and the\nclaims of the class at large.  See Appleyard, 754 F.2d at 958 (“‘[t]he typicality requirement may be\nsatisfied even if there are factual distinctions between the claims of the named plaintiffs and those\nof other class members’”) (quoting De La Fuente, 713 F.2d at 232).  However, we do require that\nthe named representatives’ claims share “‘the same essential characteristics as the claims of the class\nat large.’” Appleyard, 754 F.2d at 958 (quoting De La Fuente, 713 F.2d at 232)  (emphasis added).\nIn making this determination, we have concluded that “a strong similarity of legal theories will\nsatisfy the typicality requirement despite substantial factual differences.”  Appleyard, 754 F.2d at\n958; see also Kornberg v. Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc., 741 F.2d 1332, 1337 (11th Cir. 1984) (stating\nthat  “a  sufficient  nexus  is  established  if  the  claims or defenses of the class and the class\nrepresentative arise from the same event or pattern or practice and are based on the same legal\ntheory”).\n32\n\nrepresentative does not have the requisite typicality to raise the same claim on\nbehalf of a class.  \nAs the Supreme Court has explained, “[w]e have repeatedly held that a class\nrepresentative must be part of the class and possess the same interest and suffer the\nsame injury as the class members.”  Falcon, 457 U.S. at 156, 102 S. Ct. at 2370\n(citing East Texas Motor Freight Sys. v. Rodriguez, 431 U.S. 395, 403, 97 S. Ct.\n1891, 1896, 52 L. Ed. 2d 453 (1977)) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also\nBlum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991, 999, 102 S. Ct. 2777, 2783, 73 L. Ed. 2d 534\n(1982) (explaining that “[i]t is not enough that the conduct of which the plaintiff\ncomplains will injure someone. The complaining party must also show that he is\nwithin the class of persons who will be concretely affected.  Nor does a plaintiff\nwho has been subject to injurious conduct of one kind possess by virtue of that\ninjury the necessary stake in litigating conduct of another kind, although similar, to\nwhich he has not been subject.”).  This rule makes especially good sense when we\nconsider that one of the core purposes of conducting typicality review is to ensure\nthat “the named plaintiffs have incentives that align with those of absent class\nmembers so as to assure that the absentees’ interests will be fairly represented.” \nBaby Neal, 43 F.3d at 57; see also 1 Newberg & Conte, Newberg on Class Actions,\n§ 3.13 (3d ed. 1992).\n33\n\nThus, it is well-settled that prior to the certification of a class, and\ntechnically speaking before undertaking any formal typicality or commonality\nreview, the district court must determine that at least one named class\nrepresentative has Article III standing to raise each class subclaim.  “[A]ny analysis\nof class certification must begin with the issue of standing.”  Griffin v. Dugger,\n823 F.2d 1476, 1482 (11th Cir. 1987); see also Brown v. Sibley, 650 F.2d 760, 771\n(5th Cir. Unit A, July 1981) (stating that the “constitutional threshold [of standing]\nmust be met before any consideration of the typicality of claims or commonality of\nissues required for procedural reasons by Fed. R. Civ. P. 23”).  “Only after the\ncourt determines the issues for which the named plaintiffs have standing should it\naddress the question whether the named plaintiffs have representative capacity, as\ndefined by Rule 23(a), to assert the rights of others.”  Griffin, 823 F.2d at 1482.  It\nis not enough that a named plaintiff can establish a case or controversy between\nhimself and the defendant by virtue of having standing as to one of many claims he\nwishes to assert.  Rather, “each claim must be analyzed separately, and a claim\ncannot be asserted on behalf of a class unless at least one named plaintiff has\nsuffered the injury that gives rise to that claim.”  Id. at 1483.\nIn this case, Defendants offer a very narrow argument.  As discussed earlier,\nthey do not contend that a HCBW class should not be certified -- in fact they\n34\n\npropose two HCBW classes that they believe warrant certification.  Defendants\nlikewise do not argue that none of the named plaintiffs has standing to bring any\nHCBW class claims -- rather, in their briefs and at oral argument, Defendants\nconcede that two named plaintiffs, Daniel Lavin and Daniel Shell, do have\nindividual standing to bring three of the ten identified class claims.15  Defendants\nmerely assert that prior to class certification Plaintiffs made no showing that any\nnamed plaintiff had individual standing to bring the other seven identified class\nclaims.  See supra, Part I.  \nHaving studied the record, it is clear that there are a number of individual\nstanding challenges that cannot be resolved adequately on appeal.  For example,\nDefendants contend that a number of the named plaintiffs have not demonstrated\nthat they are eligible for HCBW services.  As best we can tell from the record\nbefore us, an HCBW applicant is considered eligible by Defendants if she (1) is a\n     15Specifically, Defendants admit that Lavin and Shell are appropriate class representatives for\nthe following three claims:\n1.  Failure to provide notice and opportunity for a hearing of the\ndenial, reduction, or termination of waiver benefits in violation of the\nDue Process Clause.\n2.  Failure to provide adequate and appropriate waiver services in\nviolation of 42 U.S.C. § 1396n.\n3.  Failure to provide waiver services with reasonable promptness in\nviolation of 42 U.S.C. 1396a.\n35\n\nclient of developmental services, (2) meets the level-of-care criteria for admission\nto an ICF/DD, and (3) elects waiver services in lieu of institutionalized care at an\nICF/DD.  This inquiry is necessarily fact-specific and requires factual proffers,\nthrough affidavits and other evidentiary documents, that have not been developed\nsufficiently as of now.16  We therefore remand this case to the district court and\ndirect it to ensure that at least one named representative of each class or subclass\nhas standing for each proffered class or subclass claim.\nWe observe as well that the class, as presently defined, appears to be\ncomposed of too many subgroups with disparate legal claims to warrant\ncertification.  As it now stands, the class consists of “all persons with\ndevelopmental disabilities who are presently receiving Home and Community-\nBased Waiver Services or who are eligible to receive Home and Community-Based\nWaiver Services, or who would receive or be eligible for Home and Community-\n     16To highlight the fluid and undeveloped state of the record, we note that Plaintiffs recently have\nfiled a motion with our court, well after oral argument was heard, to supplement the record with\nunauthenticated documents not previously reviewed by the district court.  These documents\nallegedly demonstrate that many of the named representatives, whom Defendants challenge as\nlacking standing, actually have been deemed eligible by Defendants for HCBW services.  Given the\nlate date of this submission and the fact that they have not been authenticated or reviewed by the\ndistrict court, we decline to consider these materials on appeal.  We wish to emphasize, however,\nthat the district court should consider the admissibility of this new evidence on remand --\nparticularly as it impacts the standing inquiry.\n36\n\nBased Waiver Services in the future.”  The overbreadth of this class is made plain\nby a brief consideration of the class’s subclaims.\nWhile the class ostensibly is comprised of developmentally-disabled persons\nwho meet Medicaid eligibility requirements for ICF/DD care, there are sharp\ndifferences amongst class subgroups in the type of conduct challenged and the type\nof injury suffered.  Broadly speaking, Plaintiffs allege both substantive and\nprocedural injuries:  first, they allege that Defendants provided inadequate and\ninappropriate HCBW services or denied outright HCBW services to eligible\npersons who meet the ICF/DD level-of-care requirements due to funding rather\nthan medical necessity concerns; second, they allege that Defendants failed to\nprovide HCBW services with reasonable promptness to eligible individuals; and\nfinally, they allege that Defendants unlawfully failed to provide HCBW applicants\nwith the requisite procedural safeguards including reasonably prompt claims\ndecisions and notice of an applicant’s right to appeal a claims denial.  \nWe believe these alleged injuries may be better addressed through several\nsubclasses rather than one large class.  It appears that there are three general\nsubclasses of HCBW applicants whose interests are affected by this suit.  First,\nthere are those individuals who have applied for HCBW services and been\napproved by Defendants for HCBW services, but who challenge their approved\n37\n\nservices as inadequate, inappropriate, or untimely provided (in the case of those\napplicants who are approved for a waiver but are placed on indefinite waiting lists). \nSecond, there are those persons who have applied for HCBW services but who\nhave been denied such services without notice and opportunity for hearing. \nFinally, there are those individuals who have applied for HCBW services and still\nawait an adjudication of their HCBW applications.\nWhile the alleged injuries of these subclasses may overlap to some degree,\nthere are obvious and important differences, for example, between the injury claim\nof an applicant who already has been approved but has not received HCBW\nservices, and an applicant who has been ruled ineligible or who still awaits an\neligibility ruling for HCBW services.  Notably, each group targets a different “bad\nact” of Defendants whether it be a failure to provide approved services in a\nreasonably prompt manner, a claims denial, or a failure to adjudicate a claims\napplication in a reasonably prompt manner.  Because these injury claims target\ndifferent defendant conduct, the type of proof required for each claim necessarily\nwill differ. \nIn addition, proof of these alleged injuries also requires a threshold showing\nof eligibility for HCBW services.  As noted above, it appears that an HCBW\napplicant is considered eligible by Defendants if she (1) is a client of\n38\n\ndevelopmental services, (2) meets the level-of-care- criteria for admission to an\nICF/DD, and (3) elects waiver services in lieu of institutionalized care at an\nICF/DD.  Not all members of the certified class have been ruled eligible for\nHCBW services by Defendants, however.  While some class members have been\nadjudged eligible, other class members still await an eligibility determination.  One\nadvantage then of dividing the existing class into subclasses reflecting class\nmembers’ HCBW applicant status is that each member of a subclass will occupy a\nsimilar eligibility status -- that is, either approved, denied, or pending adjudication. \nFor these reasons, it may be prudent to certify three HCBW subclasses, on\nthe basis of HCBW applicant status.   One possible approach would be the\nfollowing three subclasses:\nClass One.  All persons with developmental disabilities\nwho have applied for services which are compensable\nunder the Florida Home and Community Based Waiver\nand who have been determined to be eligible for services\nbut who have not received them with reasonable\npromptness or have received inadequate or inappropriate\nservices.\nClass Two.  All persons with developmental disabilities\nwho have applied for services compensable under the\nFlorida Home and Community Based Waiver but who\nhave been adjudged ineligible and/or denied services\nwithout notice and opportunity for hearing. \nClass Three.  All persons with developmental disabilities\nwho have applied for services compensable under the\n39\n\nFlorida Home and Community Based Waiver and have\nnot received a reasonably prompt claims determination.\nAll that said, given the slenderness of the factual record before us, we must\nleave the ultimate decision as to what kinds of appropriate subclasses to create to\nthe sound discretion of the district court.  We also note that Plaintiffs’ suit contains\nseveral additional fact-specific claims which, after further factual inquiry, may be\nbetter litigated through additional subclasses rather than through subclasses based\nsimply on HCBW applicant status.  For example, Plaintiffs’ suit now includes a\nclaim that Medicaid-eligible, developmentally-disabled children under the age of\n21 have been denied EPSDT services by Defendants.  A separate EPSDT subclass\nmay be appropriate if after further factual development it becomes clear that\nDefendants’ alleged EPSDT policy is sufficiently different from its HCBW policy. \nIn fashioning appropriate subclasses, the district court also should be careful not to\ncertify subclasses overlapping with certified classes in other related ICF/DD\nlitigation now pending.17  \n     17 There are four other related ICF/DD cases in various stages before the district court.  The most\nsimilar of these cases is Murray v. Bock, District Court No. 98-1066-CIV- FERGUSON, Appeal No.\n99-10789.  On March 10, 1999, the district court entered a Memorandum Order stating that a class\ncertification order would be entered and that the order would certify a class of “all developmentally\ndisabled individuals participating in the Home and Community-Based Waiver who are not receiving\nor who have not received some services under the Waiver for which they are eligible.”  The district\ncourt has not yet entered a class certification order.  Obviously, this proposed class would overlap\nwith the subclasses we have outlined above.\n40\n\nIn short, having accepted the Defendants’ petition for appeal under Rule\n23(f), we agree with the Defendants that the single class certified by the district\ncourt does not comply with the requirements of Rule 23(a).  Plaintiffs have not\ndemonstrated that the claims of the named class representatives possess the\nrequisite typicality with the claims of the class at large, or that the named class\nWe believe the other three cases involve distinct ICF/DD claims.  In Does v. Chiles, District\nCourt No. 92-589-CIV-FERGUSON, Appeal Nos. 96-5144 and 99-14590, Plaintiffs have moved\nfor certification of a class of “all developmentally disabled individuals in the State of Florida who\nare entitled to Intermediate Care Facilities for the Mentally Retarded (“ICF/MR”) placement but\nhave  not  received  a  placement  with  reasonable  promptness.”    The  magistrate  judge  has\nrecommended certification of this class but the district court has not yet entered its order.  \nIn Cramer v. Bush, District Court No. 96-6619-CIV-FERGUSON, Appeal No. 98-5876, the\ndistrict court on March 25, 1998 certified a class of “all individuals who are Medicaid recipients\nwho resided in private ICF/DDs in Florida as of June 30, 1997, and/or who currently reside in\nprivate ICF/DDs.”  \nFinally, in Brown v. Bush, District Court No. 98-673-CIV-FERGUSON, Appeal No.\n99-11544, the district court on March 31, 1999 certified a class of “all individuals who on or after\nJanuary 1, 1998 have resided, are residing or will reside at the DSIs, including all persons who have\nbeen transferred from DSIs to other settings, such as intermediate care facilities, group homes or\nskilled nursing facilities but remain defendants’ responsibility, and all persons at risk of being sent\nto DSIs.”  On appeal, we vacated the district court’s order and remanded with instructions that the\ndistrict court certify the following class:\nAll individuals with developmental disabilities who were residing in\na Florida DSI as of March 25, 1998, and/or are currently residing in\na Florida DSI, who are Medicaid eligible and presently receiving\nMedicaid benefits, who have properly and formally requested a\ncommunity-based placement, and who have been recommended by\na State-qualified treatment . . . team for a less restrictive placement\nthat would be medically and otherwise appropriate, given each\nindividual’s particular needs and circumstances.\n41\n\nrepresentatives possess standing to raise all of the class’s claims.  On remand, the\ndistrict court must ensure that at least one of the named class representatives\npossesses the requisite individual or associational standing to bring each of the\nclass’s legal claims.  Moreover, the wisest course may be to divide this single class\ninto subclasses according to class members’ HCBW application status provided\nthat a named representative possesses individual or associational standing for each\nproffered subclaim.  We therefore vacate the class certification order and remand\nfor further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nVACATED AND REMANDED.\n42",

WOLF  PRADO-STEIMAN  is  a  seven  year  old  boy  with  autism \nwho  presently  lives  at  home  with  his  parents  and  older  sister  in \nBroward County.  His mother applied for Medicaid Waiver Services on \nhis  behalf  and  was  provided  with  respite  in  Martin  County.  When \nhis family moved to Broward County,  he was  provided with behavioral \nservices  to  address  his  behavioral  issues.  In  April  1997,  his \nmother  was  informed  that  his  behavioral  services  were  going  to  be \nterminated.  She  was  not  provided  with  any  notice  of  appeal \nrights  or  rights  to  continued  benefits.  WOLF  needs  behavioral \nservices urgently because  school  will  be  closed  for  one  month  this \nsummer,  and  his  behavioral  problems,  including  running  away,  have \nincreased.  His  mother  has  been  told  that  he  will  be  put  on  a \nwaiting  list  for  services. \n7.  M.C.  is an  18  year old man  with cerebral palsy who  lives \nln  Broward  County.  He  uses  a  wheelchair  and  an  augmentative \ncommunication  device.  His  mother,  O.M.  has  applied  for  Medicaid \nWaiver  services  on  his  behalf.  She  has  requested  and  been  denied \npersonal  care  and  respite  services.  Because  he  has  grown,  it  is \nvery  difficult  for  her  to  continue  to  provide  him  personal  care \nwithout  assistance.  M.C.  wants  companion  services  so  that  he  can \nsocialize  like  other  teen-age  boys.  He  brings  this  action  by  his \nmother,  O.M.  He  does  presently not  have  a  legal  guardian. \n3 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 16    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/03/1998   Page 4 of 21\n8.

She  presently  lives  in  Dade  County \nwith  her  mother,  Vicky  Adawi,  who  is  in  her  80s  and  has  health \nproblems.  Over  the  past  few  years,  she  has  resided  at  several \nAssisted  Living  Facilities  and  has  been  hospitalized  at  Jackson \nMemorial  Hospital.  She  needs  physical  and  occupational  therapy. \nShe  also needs  intensive  support  for  her  daily living skills  (such \nas  bathing,  toileting,  dressing) .  Lucy  and  her  mother  want  to \ncontinue  to  live  together  but  defendants  have  refused  to  provide \nLucy with adequate  supports  to enable  her  to  live with her mother. \nFollowing  her  hospitalization at  Jackson,  a  petition was  filed  to \ninvoluntarily  place  Lucy  Adawi.  General  Master  Lewis  S.  Kimler \nfound  that  \"Respondent's mother would  like for her to  live at home, \nbut  the mother is elderly and not physically capable of meeting her \ndaughter's  needs  without  in-home  supports  and  services.\"  He \nrecommended  that  she  be  involuntarily  admitted  to  residential \nservices  provided  by  defendants.  On  June  1,  1998,  the  court \nconfirmed  the  recommendation.  As  a  result  of  defendants'  failure \nto support LUCY  ADAWI  with adequate  supports,  the court has ordered \nher to be  institutionalized.

Defendants  have  refused  to  provide  her  with  any \nservices.  Without  necessary modifications,  her bathroom  is unsafe \nand  she  is at  risk of  injury. \n10.  DANIEL  LAVIN  is  a  22  year  old  man  with  profound  mental \nretardation  and  cerebral  palsy.  He  lives  in  Dade  County  with  his \nparents,  who  both  work.  He  has  had  nothing  to  do  since  he \ngraduated from high school  in 1997.  Defendants did not provide any \nassistance  in developing  a  transitional plan for  Daniel  as  he  aged \nout  of  the  educational  system.  Daniel  now  receives  no  services \nfrom Developmental Services.  Because his parents work,  he  is often \nleft  alone  with  his  71  year  old  grandmother.  He  needs  bathroom \nmodifications to make  his bathroom accessible  for him.  He  has been \ndenied  services under  the Home  and  Community  Based Waiver,  and  has \nnever been provided with any written notice.  He  brings this action \nby  his  father  and  next  friend,  JOSE  LAVIN.  He  does  not  presently \nhave  a  legal  guardian. \n11.  DANIEL  SHELL  is  a  32  year  old  man  with  moderate  mental \nretardation  and  cerebral  palsy,  who  lives  in  Brevard  County  with \nhis  parents.  His  right  side  has  dystonia  and  is  weak.  He  has  a \nbalance  problem.  He  is  on  the  Medicaid  Home  and  Community-Based \nWaiver.  His  physical  therapist  recommended,  and  his physician has \n5 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 16    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/03/1998   Page 6 of 21\nprescribed,  physical  therapy equipment  to  increase  his  endurance, \nto  control  his  movement  disorder,  to  strengthen  and  increase \nmobility in his  right arm,  and to improve  his balance problem.  His \nparents  Donald  and  Carolyn  Shell  are  co-guardian  advocates.  They \nhave  requested  that  the  Medicaid  Home  and  Community-Based  Waiver \nprovide  him  with  the  therapy  equipment  prescribed by  his  treating \nphysician.  Defendants  have  refused  to  provide  the  equipment  and \nhave  not  provided  any  notice  of  due  process  rights.  His  mother \nwrote  a  letter requesting  an  appeal  on March  19,  1998,  and  has  not \nreceived  any  response  to  date.  As  a  result  of  the  lack  of  this \nequipment,  Daniel  Shell  has  lost  skills  that  he  had  previously \ngained  from  physical  therapy.  He  brings  this case  by  his  parents \nand  next  friends,  Carolyn  and  Donald  Shell. \n12.  Plaintiffs Wolf  Prada-Steiman,  M. C.,  Lucy Adawi,  Jennifer \nBastidas,  DAniel  Lavin  and  Daniel  Shell  are  eligible  for  ICF/DD \nservices  and  for  Home  and  Community-Based  Waiver  services. \n13.

LAWTON  CHILES  is Governor  of  the  State  of  Florida  and \nis  sued  here  in  his  official  capacity.  CHILES  has  the \n6 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 16    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/03/1998   Page 7 of 21\nresponsibility to  ensure  that  the  agencies  of  the  Executive  Branch \nof  the  State,  including  the  Department  for  Children  and  Families \n(DCF)  and  the  Agency  for Health Care Administration  (AHCA)  ,  act  in \nfull  compliance  with  the  Constitution  and  the  laws  of  the  United \nStates. \n15.  EDWARD  FEAVER  is Secretary of  DCF  and  has  responsibility \nfor the control and the administration of human services,  including \nthe Developmental Services Program and its related Medicaid Program \nin the State of  Florida.  He  is sued here  in his official capacity. \n16.  CHARLES  KIMBER  is  a  Deputy  Secretary  for  DCF  and  has \nresponsibility  for  the  control  and  the  administration  of  human \nservices,  including  the  Developmental  Services  Program  and  its \nrelated Medicaid  Program  in the  State of  Florida.  He  is  sued  here \nin  his  official  capacity. \n17.  JOHN  BROWN  is the District Administrator for DCF  District \n10,  which  includes  Broward  County.  He  is  sued  here  in  official \ncapacity. \n18.  Defendant  DOUG  COOK  is  the  Director  of  the  Agency  for \nHealth  Care  Administration.  He  is  sued  here  in  his  official \ncapacity.  He  is responsible for administering the Florida Medicaid \nprogram  so  that  it complies  with  federal  law. \n19.  Defendant RICHARD  T.  LUTZ  is the Director of  the Division \nof  Medicaid of AHCA.  He  is sued here  in his official capacity.  He \n1s  responsible  for  the  overall  operation  of  Medicaid  and  is \nrequired  to  ensure  that  it complies  with  federal  law. \n7 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 16    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/03/1998   Page 8 of 21\n20.  All  defendants  have  at  all  relevant  times  acted  under \ncolor  of  state  law  and  knew  of  or  should  have  known  of  the \npolicies,  practices,  acts  and  conditions  alleged. \nCLASS  ACTION  ALLEGATIONS \n21.  The  named  plaintiffs  bring  this  action  on  their  own \nbehalf  and  on  behalf  of  all  other  similarly  situated  persons \npursuant  to  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  23(a),  and  (b) (2). \n22.  The  proposed  class  consists  of  all  current  and  future \nindividuals with developmental  disabilities who  are receiving Home \nand Community  Based Waiver  Services or who  are  eligible  to  receive \nHome  and  Community  Based  Waiver  Services. \n23.  The requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P.  Rule 23(a)  are satisfied \nin  this  case  as  follows: \na.  Numerosity:  The  class is so numerous  that  joinder of all \nmembers  is  impracticable.  Upon  information  and  belief,  the  class \nconsists  of  more  than  20,000  individuals. \nb.  Commonality:  There  are  questions  of  law  or  fact  common \nto  all named  plaintiffs as  well  as  to  all members  of  the  class,  to \nwit:  whether  the  defendants'  have  violated  the  Medicaid  Act,  42 \nU.S.C.  §  1983,  and  the  Due  Process  and  Equal  Protection Clauses  of \nthe  Constitution of  the  United  States. \nc.  Typicality:  The  claims  of  the  named  plaintiffs  are \ntypical  of  the  claims  of  the  class  as  a  whole. \nd.  Adequate  representation:  By  filing  this  action,  the \nnamed plaintiffs,  individually and through their guardians and next \nfriends,  have displayed an  interest in vindicating their rights,  as \n8 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 16    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/03/1998   Page 9 of 21\nwell as  the claims of others who  are  similarly situated.  The  named \nplaintiffs  will  fairly  and  adequately  protect  and  represent  the \ninterests  of  the  class.  Furthermore,  the  named  plaintiffs  are \nrepresented  by  legal  counsel  who  are  skilled  and  knowledgeable \nabout  the  Medicaid  Program,  civil  rights  litigation,  practice  and \nprocedure in the federal courts,  and the prosecution and management \nof  class  action  litigation.  The  relief  sought  by  the  named \nplaintiffs  will  inure  to  the  benefit  of  members  of  the  class \ngenerally. \n24.  The  requirement  of  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  23(b) (2)  is  also \nsatisfied.  The  defendants  have  acted or  refused  to  act  on  grounds \ngenerally  applicable  to  the  class,  thereby  making  appropriate \ndeclaratory  and  injunctive  relief  with  respect  to  the  class  as  a \nwhole.  Although  the  disabilities  of  the  class  members  vary,  they \nshare  in  common  a  need  for  services  provided  by  the  Home  and \nCommunity  Based  Waiver  Program. \nSTATUTORY  AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  FRAMEWORK \n25.  The  Medicaid  program,  established by  Title  XIX  of  the \nSocial  Security Act,  42  U.S.C.  §  1396,  et  ggg.,  is  a  cooperative \nfederal-state  program  to  enable  the  states  to  furnish  medical \nassistance  to  families  and  individuals  who  are  unable  to  meet  the \ncosts  of  necessary  medical  services.  42  U.S.C.  §  1396.  Costs  of \nthe  program  are  shared  by  the  federal  and  state  governments,  with \nthe  federal  government  contributing  approximately  55  per  cent  of \nthe  cost  of  services  in  Florida. \n9 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 16    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/03/1998   Page 10 of 21\n26.  A  state  is not  obligated to participate  in the Medicaid \nProgram.  If  a  state  elects  to  participate,  however,  it  must \noperate  its  program  in  compliance  with  federal  statutory  and \nregulatory requirements.  42  U.S.C.  §  1396a.  Florida has chosen to \nparticipate  in  the  Medicaid  program. \n27.  Medicaid  is  permitted  to  control  the  utilization  of \ncovered  services  through  the  application  of  a  medical  necessity \ntest.  When  applying  a  medical  necessity  standard,  the  Florida \nMedicaid  Program must  ensure  that  recipients  with  the  most  severe \ndisabilities  or  conditions  are  served  before  recipients  with  less \nsevere  disabilities.  42  C.F.R.  §  440.230(d). \n28.  State  plans  must  also  provide  an  opportunity  for  a  fair \nhearing to any  individual whose  claim for medical  assistance under \nthe plan is denied or is not  acted upon with reasonable promptness. \n42  U.S.C.  §  1396a(3)  and  42  C.F.R.  §  431.200,  et  seq. \n29.  Defendants must mail and give advance  notice at least ten \n(10)  days  before  the  date  of  termination  of  or  reduction  in \nMedicaid  benefits.  45  C.F.R.  §  431.211. 1  The  purpose  of  the \nadvance  notice  is  to  afford  the  recipient  of  the  service  an \nopportunity for a  pre-termination hearing.  42  C.F.R.  §  431.231(c). \nTHE  HOME  AND  COMMUNITY-BASED  WAIVER \n30.  Congress  adopted  the  Home  and  Community-Based  Waiver  in \norder  to  allow  individuals  who  would  otherwise  require  care  in  a \nnursing  home  or  ICF/DD  to  receive  services  in  their own  homes  and \n1  There  are  limited  exceptions  to  the  advance  notice \nrequirement  at  45  C.F.R  §§431.213  and  431.214,  which  are  not \napplicable  here. \n10 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 16    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/03/1998   Page 11 of 21\nin  home-like  settings.  See  Senate  Report  No.  97-139  and  House \nConference  Report  No.  97-208,  1981  U.S.  Code  Cong.  & Admin.  News., \nat  396. \n31.  The  regulations  state  that  11Section  1915(c)  of  the  Act \npermits  states  to offer,  under  a  waiver of  statutory requirements, \nan  array  of  home  and  community-based  services  that  an  individual \nneeds  to  avoid  insti tut.ionaliza tion. 11  42  C.F.R.  §  441.300 \n(emphasis  added) \n32.  Under  the  waiver  provisions  of  the  Act,  states  may \ninclude as  11medical  assistance\"  the cost of home  or community based \nservices which,  if not  provided,  would  require  care  to be  provided \nin a  nursing home  or an  Intermediate Care  Facility for  Persons with \nMental  Retardation  (Developmental  Disabilities)  ( ICF/DD) .  42 \nU.S.C.  §1396n(c);  42  C.F.R.  §  435.217.  42  U.S.C.  §  1396n(c) (1) \nstates: \nThe  Secretary  may  by  waiver  provide  that  a  State \nplan  approved  under  this  subchapter  may  include  as \n11medical  assistance11  under  such plan payment  for part or \nall  of  the  cost  of  home  or  community-based  services \n(other  than  room  and  board)  approved  by  the  Secretary \nwhich  are  provided pursuant  to  a  written plan of  care  to \nindividuals  with  respect  to  whom  there  has  been  a \ndetermination that but for the provision of such services \nthe  individuals would  require  the  level of  care provided \nin  a  hospital  or  nursing  facility  or  intermediate  care \nfacility  for  the  mentally  retarded  the  cost  of  which \ncould  be  reimbursed  under  the  State  plan. \n33.  Federal  law  sets a  ceiling for  funds  used under  the Home \nand  Community  Based  Waiver.  42  U.S.C.  §  1396n(c) (2)  (D)  requires \nthat  11the  average  per capita expenditure  estimated by  the  State  in \nany  fiscal  year  for  medical  assistance  provided  with  respect  to \nsuch  individual  does  not  exceed  100  percent  of  the  average  per \n11 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 16    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/03/1998   Page 12 of 21\ncapita  expenditure  that  the  State  reasonably  estimates  would  have \nbeen  made  in  that  fiscal  year  if  the  waiver  had  not  been \ngranted. \"  Thus,  federal  law  permits  states  to  fund  Home  and \nCommunity-Based  Waiver  up  to  the  same  average  rate  as  ICF/DDs. \n34.  Congress  provided that  a  Home  and Community-Based Waiver \nshall  not  be  granted  unless  the  State  provides  assurances  that \n\"necessary  safeguards  (including  adequate  standards  for  provider \nparticipation)  have been taken to protect the health and welfare of \nindividuals  provided  services  under  the  waiver  .  \"  42  U.S.C. \n§  1396n(2) (A);  42  C.F.R.  §  441.302  (a)  Those  safeguards  must \ninclude  \" [a] adequate  standards  for  all  types  of  providers  that \nprovide  services  under  the  waiver.\"  42  C.F.R.  §  441.302  (a) (1). \n35.  Congress  also  requires  that  individuals  with \ndevelopmental  disabilities have  the freedom of choice as to whether \nto  receive  services  in an  ICF/DD  or  under  the  Home  and  Community \nBased  Waiver.  42  U.S.C.  §  1396n(2) (C)  provides  that  individuals \n\"who  are  determined  to  be  likely  to  require  the  level  of  care \nprovided  in  a  hospital,  nursing  facility,  or  intermediate  care \nfacility  for  the  mentally  retarded  are  informed  of  the  feasible \nalternatives,  if available under  the  waiver,  at  the  choice  of  such \nindividuals,  to  the  provision  of  inpatient  hospital  services, \nnursing  facility  services,  or  services  in  an  intermediate  care \nfacility  for  the  mentally  retarded  (developmentally  disabled).\" \n36.  Florida first obtained approval  for a  Home  and Community \nBased  Waiver  in  1982  for  day  treatment  services.  A  subsequent \ncomprehensive  amendment  Co  Florida's  Home  and  Community-Based \n12 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 16    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/03/1998   Page 13 of 21\nWaiver,  approved  in  1992,  adopts  the  philosophy  of  avoiding \ninstitutional  care  and  provides  supports  and  services  to \nindividuals  with  developmental  disabilities  in  their own  homes  or \nhome-like  settings. \nDEFENDANTS'  UNLAWFUL  ACTIONS \n37.  Defendants  have  consistently  denied  individuals  with \ndevelopmental disabilities their rights to HCBW  services and to due \nprocess. \n38.  As  a  matter  of  practice,  defendants  do  not  provide \nplaintiffs  with  procedural  due  process  protections.  Typically, \ndefendants  deny  individuals  services,  stating  that  funds  are  not \navailable.  Defendants  do  not  provide  notice  that  the  Medicaid \nstatute provides for procedural protections,  including the right to \nappeal  adverse  determinations. \n39.  Defendants  routinely  terminate  individuals  like  Wolf \nPrado-Steiman  and  M.C.  from  services  and  never  provide  any  notice \nof  proceduraJ  protections,  including  the  right  to  appeal  adverse \ndeterminations  and  the  right  to continued benefits pending appeal. \n40.  Defendants  fail  to  provide  individuals  with  services  in \nthe  most  integrated  setting,  their homes  and  community.  Instead, \ndefendants  make  services  available  only  in  institutional  setting. \nFamilies  that  care  for  their  children at  home  do  not  even  receive \nthe most  basic  services.  For  example,  individuals  in institutions \nwho  are not  continent  receive diapers whereas  individuals who  live \nat  home  with  their  families  are  routinely denied  diapers. \n13 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 16    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/03/1998   Page 14 of 21\n41.  Defendants  routinely deny  individuals  physical  therapy, \noccupational  therapy,  speech  therapy,  and  assistive  technology \ndevices  and  services. \n42.  For many  families,  respite,  personal  care,  and  companion \nservices  are  vi tal  to  keep  their  family  members  home.  Yet, \ndefendants  routinely deny  these  services.  Without  these  services, \nmany  parents  are  forced  to  institutionalize  their  children. \n43.  Despite defendants'  claims  of  lack of  funds,  the  federal \nmatch  (55%)  is  available  for  HCBW  services.  Nonetheless, \ndefendants  continue  to  serve  many  individuals  eligible  for  HCBW \nservices with general revenue dollars,  failing to take advantage of \nthe  federal  match. \nCLAIMS  FOR  RELIEF \nFIRST  CAUSE  OF  ACTION \nAMERICANS  WITH  DISABILITIES  ACT \n44.  On  July  12,  1990,  Congress  enacted  the  Americans  with \nDisabilities  Act,  42  U.S. C.  §  12101,  et  seq.,  (ADA)  ,  establishing \nthe  most  important  civil  rights  for  persons  with  disabilities  in \nour  nation's  history. \n45.  Congress  stated  in  its  findings  that,  \"historically, \nsociety  has  tended  to  isolate  and  segregate  individuals  with \ndisabilities,  and,  despite  some  improvements,  such  forms  of \ndiscrimination against individuals with disabilities continue to be \na  serious  and pervasive  social problem.\"  42  U.S.C.  §  12101 (a) (2). \n14 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 16    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/03/1998   Page 15 of 21\n46.  Congress  found  that  \"discrimination against  individuals \nwith disabilities persists  in  .  institutionalization  .  and \naccess  to  public  services.\"  42  U.S.C.  §  12101(a) (3) \n47.  Congress  found  that  \"individuals  with  disabilities \ncontinually  encounter  various  forms  of  discrimination,  including \noutright  intentional exclusion  ,  segregation,  and  relegation \nto  lesser services,  programs,  activities,  benefits,  jobs,  or other \nopportunities.\"  42  U.S.C.  §  12101 (a)  (5) \n48.  Congress  further  found  that: \nindividuals with disabilities are  a  discrete and  insular \nminority  who  have  been  faced  with  restrictions  and \nlimitations,  subjected  to  a  history  of  purposeful  unequal \ntreatment,  and  relegated  to  a  position  of  political \npowerlessness  in  our  society,  based  on  characteristics  that \nare beyond  the  control of  such  individuals and  resulting from \nstereotypic assumptions not truly indicative of the individual \nability of  such  individuals  to participate in,  and contribute \nto,  society. \n42  u.s.c.  §  12101(a) (7) \n49.  A  major  purpose  of  the  ADA  is  to  provide  a  clear  and \ncomprehensive  national  mandate  for  the  elimination  of \ndiscrimination  against  individuals  with  disabilities,  and  to \nprovide  clear,  strong,  consistent  and  enforceable  standards \naddressing  discrimination  against  individuals  with  disabilities. \n42  u.s.c.  §  12101(b)l&2. \n50.  Each  plaintiff  and  each  class  member  is  \"a  qualified \nindividual  with  a  disability\"  within  the  meaning  of  42  U.S.C.  § \n12131(2). \n51.  The  Home  and  Community-Based  Waiver  program  are  public \nservices  subject  to Title  II  of  the ADA,  42  U.S.C.  §§  12131-12134. \n15 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 16    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/03/1998   Page 16 of 21\n52.  Defendants  routinely deny  individuals  who  live  in  their \nown  homes  or with their families  or in community  settings services \nsuch as physical therapy,  occupational therapy,  speech therapy,  and \ndental  services  that  are  available  to  individuals  who  are  in \nICF/DDs. \n53.  Defendants'  denial  of  necessary  services,  while \noffering  the  option  of  more  expensive,  institutional  services \nviolates  the  ADA,  and  specifically  the  \"Integration  Mandate\" \nimplementing  the  ADA  as  found  in  28  C.F.R.  §  35.130(d)  which \nrequires  that:  \"a  public  entity  shall  administer  services, \nprograms,  and activities in the most  integrated setting appropriate \nto  the  needs  of  qualified  individuals  with  disabilities.\" \n54.  The  ADA  also  prohibits  discrimination  in  access  to \ncovered  services  that  are  based  on  either  severity of  disability, \nor  diagnosis. \n55.  Defendants  have  engaged  in  diagnosis-based  decision \nmaking  by  denying  or  limiting  access  to  benefits,  services  and \nopportunities  because  a  person  has  a  particular  disability, \nimpairment  or  diagnosis. \nSECOND  CAUSE  OF  ACTION \nSECTION  504  OF  THE  REHABILITATION  ACT  OF  1973 \n56.  Defendants  receive  federal  funds  and  are  therefore \nsubject  to  the  requirements  of  Section  504  of  the  Rehabilitation \nAct  of  1973  (Section  504),  29  U.S.C.  §  794. \n16 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 16    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/03/1998   Page 17 of 21\n57.  Plaintiffs  meet  the  definition  of  having  a  \"handicap\" \nwithin  the  meaning  of  29  U.S.C.  §  706(7)  and  are  otherwise \nqualified  individuals  under  Section  504. \n58.  Defendants'  practices,  policies and procedures described \nabove,  violate  the  rights of plaintiffs and  class members  that are \nsecured by Section 504  by discriminating against  these  individuals \nsolely on  the  basis  of  disability. \nTHIRD  CAUSE  OF  ACTION \nPROCEDURAL  DUE  PROCESS  AND  SECTION  1983 \n59.  Plaintiffs'  eligibility  for  and  receipt  of  Medicaid \nservices creates a  property right subject to due process protection \nunder  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  Constitution  of  the  United \nStates. \n60.  Florida's  Home  and  Community-Based  Waiver  specifically \nprovides  for  a  fair  hearing,  as  required  by  42  C.F.R.  Part  431, \nsubpart E,  to Medicaid recipients who  are denied the services(s)  of \ntheir  choice  or  the  provider(s)  of  their  choice. \n61.  Defendants  have  not  provided  any  procedural  protections \nfor  plaintiffs  and  class  members. \n62.  By  denying  plaintiffs  and  class  members  the  opportunity \nfor  a  fair  hearing  to  challenge  the  termination  of  Home  and \nCommunity Based Waiver  and  for  continued benefits,  defendants  have \nviolated the  Due  Process  Clause  of  the Fourteenth Amendment  to  the \nConstitution  of  the  United  States,  federal  Medicaid  law  and \nregulations,  and  the  terms  of  Florida's  Home  and  Community-Based \nWaiver. \n17 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 16    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/03/1998   Page 18 of 21\nFOURTH  CAUSE  OF  ACTION \n42  U.S.  C.  §  1396a(8)  and  42  U.S.C.  §  1983 \n63.  Defendants  fail  to provide HCBW  services with reasonable \npromptness  in  violation  of  42  U.S.C.  §  1936a(8)  and  42  U.S.C.  § \n1983. \nFIFTH  CAUSE  OF  ACTION \n42  U.S.C.  §  1396n  and  42  U.S.C.  §  1983. \n64.  Serving  individuals  in  institutions  is  contrary  to  the \nletter and  intent  of  42  U.S.C.  §  1396n. \n65.  Defendants  fund  institutional placements using the Home \nand Community-Based Waiver.  Such  a  use  of  HCBW  funds  violates  the \nexclusion  of  institutional  programs  from  the  Home  and  Community \nBased  Waiver  program  and  therefore  violates  42  U.S.C.  §  1396n  and \n42  u.s.c.  §  1983. \nSIXTH  CAUSE  OF  ACTION \n42  U.S.C.  §  1396n(2) (a)  and  42  U.S.C.  §  1983 \n66.  Defendants  are  violating  42  U.S.C.  §  1396n(2) (a)  and  42 \nu.s.c.  §  1983  by  providing  inadequate  services  to  individuals \neligible  for  Home  and  Community-Based  services  for  the  Home  and \nCommunity-Based  Waiver.  Defendants  do  not  provide  sufficient \nresources  to protect  the  health and welfare  of  individuals provide \nservices under  the waiver.  42  U.S.C.  §  1396n(2) (A).  As  a  result \nof  defendants'  failure  to  provide  necessary  services,  individuals \nexperience  pain,  emotional  harm,  and  regress,  losing  skills  that \nthey  had  previously  gained  from  school  and  from  therapeutic \nservices. \n18 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 16    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/03/1998   Page 19 of 21\nSEVENTH  CAUSE  OF  ACTION \n42  U.S.C.  §  1396n(c) (2)  and  42  U.S.C.  §  1983 \n67.  Defendants  have  violated  42  U.S.C.  §  1396n(c) (2)  by \ndenying  plaintiffs  their  freedom  of  choice  of  an  appropriate  Home \nand  Community-Based  Waiver  program  that  meets  their  health  and \nwelfare  needs. \n68.  Defendants  provide  only  limited  services  to  individuals \nto  remain  in  their own  homes,  family  homes  or  community  homes. \n69.  Without  adequate  services  available  in  the  community, \nindividuals  are  unnecessarily  institutionalized. \n70.  Defendants  are  therefore  in  violation  of  42  U.S. C.  § \n1396n(c) (2)  and  42  U.S.C.  §  1983. \nPRAYER  FOR  RELIEF \nWHEREFORE,  plaintiffs pray  that  this  Court: \nA.

Order  defendants  to  provide  plaintiffs  and  members \nof  the  class with necessary services  to enable  them  to  live  in the \ncommunity. \n19 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 16    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/03/1998   Page 20 of 21\nE  Award plaintiffs their costs and reasonable attorneys' \nfees. \nF  Grant  such  other  and  further  relief  as  the  Court \ndeems  just  and  proper. \nRespectfully  submitted, \nELLEN  M.

Commonality:  There  are  questions  of  law  or  fact  common \nto all named  plaintiffs as  well  as  to  all members  of  the  class,  to \nwit:  whether  the  defendants'  have  violated  the  Medicaid  Act,  42 \nU.S.C.  §  1983,  and  the  Due  Process  and Equal  Protection Clauses  of \nthe  Constitution of  the  United  States. \nc.  Typicality:  The  claims  of  the  named  plaintiffs  are \ntypical  of  the  claims  of  the  class  as  a  whole. \nd.  Adequate  representation:  By  filing  this  action,  the \nnamed plaintiffs,  individually and through their guardians and next \n5 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 1    Entered on FLSD Docket 05/14/1998   Page 6 of 18\nfriends,  have displayed an interest in vindicating their rights,  as \nwell as  the claims of others who  are  similarly situated.  The  named \nplaintiffs  will  fairly  and  adequately  protect  and  represent  the \ninterests  of  the  class.  Furthermore,  the  named  plaintiffs  are \nrepresented  by  legal  counsel  who  are  skilled  and  knowledgeable \nabout  the  Medicaid  Program,  civil  rights  litigation,  practice  and \nprocedure in the federal courts,  and the prosecution and management \nof  class  action  litigation.  The  relief  sought  by  the  named \nplaintiffs  will  inure  to  the  benefit  of  members  of  the  class \ngenerally. \n19.  The  requirement  of  Fed.R.Civ.P.  23(b) (2)  is  also \nsatisfied  in  this  case.  The  defendants  have  acted  or  refused  to \nact  on  grounds  generally  applicable  to  the  class,  thereby  making \nappropriate  declaratory  relief,  with  respect  to  the  class  as  a \nwhole.  Although  the  disabilities of  the  class  members  vary,  they \nshare  in  common  a  need  for  services  provided  by  the  Home  and \nCommunity  Based Waiver  Program. \nSTATUTORY  AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  FRAMEWORK \n20.  The  Medicaid  program,  established by  Title  XIX  of  the \nSocial  Security Act,  42  U.S.C.  §  1396,  et  ~., is  a  cooperative \nfederal-state  program  to  enable  the  states  to  furnish  medical \nassistance  to  families  and  individuals  who  are  unable  to  meet  the \ncosts  of  necessary medical  services.  42  U.S.C.  §  1396.  Costs  of \nthe  program  are  shared by  the  federal  and  state  governments,  with \nthe  federal  government  contributing  approximately  55  per  cent  of \nthe  cost  of  services  in  Florida. \n6 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 1    Entered on FLSD Docket 05/14/1998   Page 7 of 18\n21.  A  state is not  obligated to participate  in  the Medicaid \nProgram.  If  a  state  elects  to  participate,  however,  it  must \noperate  its  program  in  compliance  with  federal  statutory  and \nregulatory requirements.  42  U.S.C.  §  1396a.  Florida has  chosen to \nparticipate  in  the  Medicaid  program. \n22.  Medicaid  is  permitted  to  control  the  utilization  of \ncovered  services  through  the  application  of  a  medical  necessity \ntest.  When  applying  a  medical  necessity  standard,  the  Florida \nMedicaid  Program  must  ensure  that  recipients  with  the  most  severe \ndisabilities  or  conditions  are  served  before  recipients  with  less \nsevere  disabilities.  42  C.F.R.  §  440.230(d). \n23.  State plans  must  also  provide  an  opportunity  for  a  fair \nhearing  to any  individual whose  claim for medical  assistance under \nthe plan is denied or is not  acted upon with reasonable  promptness. \n42  U.S.C.  §  1396a(3)  and  42  C.F.R.  §  431.200,  et  seq. \n24.  Defendants must mail and give advance notice at  least ten \n( 10)  days  before  the  date  of  termination  of  or  reduction  in \nMedicaid  benefits.  45  C.F.R.  §  431.211. 1  The  purpose  of  the \nadvance  notice  is  to  afford  the  recipient  of  the  service  an \nopportunity for a  pre-termination hearing.  42  C.F.R.  §  431.231(c). \nVIII.  THE  HOME  AND  COMMUNITY-BASED  WAIVER \n25.  Congress  adopted  the  Home  and  Community-Based  Waiver  in \norder  to  allow  individuals  who  would  otherwise  require  care  in  a \nnursing  home  or  ICF/DD  to  receive  services  in  their  own  homes  and \n1  There  are  limited exceptions  to  the  advance  notice \nrequirement  at  45  C.F.R  §§431.213  and  431.214,  which  are  not \napplicable  here. \n7 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 1    Entered on FLSD Docket 05/14/1998   Page 8 of 18\nin  home-like  settings.  See  Senate  Report  No.  97-139  and  House \nConference  Report  No.  97-208,  1981  U.S.  Code  Cong.  & Admin.  News., \nat  396. \n26.  The  regulations  state  that  \"Section  1915(c)  of  the  Act \npermits  states to offer,  under  a  waiver of  statutory requirements, \nan  array  of  home  and  community-based  services  that  an  individual \nneeds  to  avoid  institutionalization.\"  42  C.F.R.  §  441.300 \n(emphasis  added) \n2 7.  Under  the  waiver  provisions  of  the  Act,  states  may \ninclude as  \"medical assistance\"  the cost of home  or community based \nservices which,  if not  provided,  would  require  care  to  be  provided \nin a  nursing home  or an  Intermediate Care  Facility for  Persons with \nMental  Retardation  (Developmental  Disabilities)  ( ICF /DD) .  42 \nU.S.C.  §1396n(c) i  42  C.F.R.  §  435.217.  42  U.S.C.  §  1396n(c) (1) \nstates: \nThe  Secretary  may  by  waiver  provide  that  a  State \nplan  approved  under  this  subchapter  may  include  as \n\"medical  assistance\"  under  such plan payment  for part or \nall  of  the  cost  of  home  or  community-based  services \n(other  than  room  and  board)  approved  by  the  Secretary \nwhich  are provided pursuant  to a  written plan of  care  to \nindividuals  with  respect  to  whom  there  has  been  a \ndetermination that but for the provision of such services \nthe  individuals would  require  the  level of  care provided \nin  a  hospital  or  nursing  facility  or  intermediate  care \nfacility  for  the  mentally  retarded  the  cost  of  which \ncould  be  reimbursed  under  the  State plan. \n28.  Federal  law  sets a  ceiling for  funds  used under  the  Home \nand  Community  Based  Waiver.  42  U.S.C.  §  1396n(c) (2)  (D)  requires \nthat  \"the  average  per capita expenditure  estimated by  the  State  in \nany  fiscal  year  for  medical  assistance  provided  with  respect  to \nsuch  individual  does  not  exceed  100  percent  of  the  average  per \n8 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 1    Entered on FLSD Docket 05/14/1998   Page 9 of 18\ncapita  expenditure  that  the  State  reasonably  estimates  would  have \nbeen  made  in  that  fiscal  year  if  the  waiver  had  not  been \ngranted. \"  Thus,  federal  law  permits  states  to  fund  Home  and \nCommunity-Based  Waiver  up  to  the  same  average  rate  as  ICF/DDs. \n29.  Congress  provided that a  Home  and Community-Based Waiver \nshall  not  be  granted  unless  the  State  provides  assurances  that \n\"necessary  safeguards  (including  adequate  standards  for  provider \nparticipation)  have been taken to protect the health and welfare of \nindividuals  provided  services  under  the  waiver  .  II  42  u.s.c. \n§  1396n(2) (A);  42  C.F.R.  §  441.302  (a)  Those  safeguards  must \ninclude  \" [a] adequate  standards  for  all  types  of  providers  that \nprovide  services  under  the  waiver.\"  42  C.F.R.  §  441.302  (a) (1). \n30.  Congress  also  requires  that  individuals  with \ndevelopmental disabilities have  the freedom of choice as to whether \nto  receive  services  in  an  ICF/DD  or  under  the  Home  and  Community \nBased  Waiver.  42  U.S.C.  §  1396n(2) (C)  provides  that  individuals \n\"who  are  determined  to  be  likely  to  require  the  level  of  care \nprovided  in  a  hospital,  nursing  facility,  or  intermediate  care \nfacility  for  the  mentally  retarded  are  informed  of  the  feasible \nalternatives,  if available under  the waiver,  at  the  choice  of  such \nindividuals,  to  the  provision  of  inpatient  hospital  services, \nnursing  facility  services,  or  services  in  an  intermediate  care \nfacility  for  the  mentally  retarded  (developmentally  disabled).\" \n31.  Florida first obtained approval  for a  Home  and Community \nBased  Waiver  in  1982  for  day  treatment  services.  A  subsequent \nrequest  for  a  comprehensive  amendment  to  Florida's  Home  and \n9 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 1    Entered on FLSD Docket 05/14/1998   Page 10 of 18\nCommunity-Based  waiver  was  approved  in  1992  that  adopts  the \nphilosophy of avoiding institutional care and provides  supports and \nservices  to  individuals  with  developmental  disabilities  in  their \nown  homes  or home-like  settings. \nVIII.  DEFENDANTS'  UNLAWFUL  ACTIONS \n32.  Defendants  have  consistently  denied  individuals  with \ndevelopmental disabilities their rights to HCBW  services and to due \nprocess. \n33.  As  a  matter  of  practice,  defendants  do  not  provide \nplaintiffs  with  procedural  due  process  protections.  Typically, \ndefendants  deny  individuals  services,  stating  that  funds  are  not \navailable.  Defendants  do  not  provide  notice  that  the  Medicaid \nstatute provides for procedural protections,  including the right to \nappeal  adverse  determinations. \n34.  Defendants  routinely  terminate  individuals  like  Wolf \nPrada-Steiman  and  M.C.  from  services  and  never  provide  any  notice \nof  procedural  protections,  including  the  right  to  appeal  adverse \ndeterminations  and  the  right to continued benefits pending appeal. \n35.  Defendants  fail  to  provide  individuals  with  services  in \nthe  most  integrated  setting,  their homes  and  community.  Instead, \ndefendants  make  services  available  only  in  institutional  setting. \nFamilies  that  care  for  their  children  at  home  do  not  even  receive \nthe most  basic  services.  For example,  individuals  in  institutions \nwho  are not  continent  receive diapers whereas  individuals who  live \nat  home  with  their  families  are  routinely denied  diapers. \n36.  Defendants  routinely deny  individuals  physical  therapy, \n10 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 1    Entered on FLSD Docket 05/14/1998   Page 11 of 18\noccupational  therapy,  speech  therapy,  and  assisti ve  technology \ndevices  and  services. \n37.  For many  families,  respite,  personal  care,  and companion \nservices  are  vital  to  keep  their  family  members  home.  Without \nthese  services,  many  parents  are  forced  to  institutionalize  their \nchildren. \n38.  Despite defendants'  claims  of  lack of  funds,  the  federal \nmatch  (55%)  is  available  for  HCBW  services.  Nonetheless, \ndefendants  continue  to  serve  many  individuals  eligible  for  HCBW \nservices with general revenue dollars,  failing to take advantage of \nthe  federal  match. \nCLAIMS  FOR  RELIEF \nFIRST  CAUSE  OF  ACTION \nAMERICANS  WITH  DISABILITIES  ACT \n39.  On  July  12,  1990,  Congress  enacted  the  Americans  with \nDisabilities Act,  42  U.S.C.  §  12101,  et  seq.,  (ADA),  establishing \nthe  most  important  civil  rights  for  persons  with  disabilities  in \nour  nation's  history. \n40.  Congress  stated  in  its  findings  that,  \"historically, \nsociety  has  tended  to  isolate  and  segregate  individuals  with \ndisabilities,  and,  despite  some  improvements,  such  forms  of \ndiscrimination against individuals with disabilities continue to be \na  serious  and pervasive  social problem.\"  42  U.S.C.  §  12101 (a) (2). \n41.  Congress  found  that  \"discrimination against  individuals \nwith disabilities persists  in  .  institutionalization  .  and \naccess  to  public  services.\"  42  U.S. C.  §  12101 (a) ( 3) . \n11 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 1    Entered on FLSD Docket 05/14/1998   Page 12 of 18\n42.  Congress  found  that  \"individuals  with  disabilities \ncontinually  encounter  various  forms  of  discrimination,  including \noutright  intentional exclusion  ,  segregation,  and  relegation \nto lesser services,  programs,  activities,  benefits,  jobs,  or other \nopportunities.\"  42  U.S.C.  §  12101(a) (5) \n43.  Congress  further  found  that: \nindividuals with disabilities are a  discrete  and  insular \nminority  who  have  been  faced  with  restrictions  and \nlimitations,  subjected  to  a  history  of  purposeful  unequal \ntreatment,  and  relegated  to  a  position  of  political \npowerlessness  in  our  society,  based  on  characteristics  that \nare beyond  the  control of  such  individuals and  resulting from \nstereotypic assumptions not truly indicative of the individual \nability of  such  individuals  to participate in,  and  contribute \nto,  society. \n42  U.S.C.  §  12101(a) (7) \n44.  A  major  purpose  of  the  ADA  is  to  provide  a  clear  and \ncomprehensive  national  mandate  for  the  elimination  of \ndiscrimination  against  individuals  with  disabilities,  and  to \nprovide  clear,  strong,  consistent  and  enforceable  standards \naddressing  discrimination  against  individuals  with  disabilities. \n42  u.s.c.  §  12101(b)1&2. \n45.  Each  plaintiff  and  each  class  member  is  11a  qualified \nindividual  with  a  disability\"  within  the  meaning  of  42  U.S.C.  § \n12131(2). \n46.  The  Home  and  Community-Based  Waiver  program  are  public \nservices  subject  to Title  II of  the ADA,  42  U.S.C.  §§  12161-12165. \n47.  Defendants  routinely deny  individuals  who  live  in  their \nown  homes  or with their families  or in community  settings services \nsuch as physical therapy,  occupational therapy,  speech therapy,  and \n12 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 1    Entered on FLSD Docket 05/14/1998   Page 13 of 18\ndental  services  that  are  available  to  individuals  who  are  in \nICF/DDs. \n48.  Defendants'  denial  of  necessary  services,  while \noffering  the  option  of  more  expensive,  institutional  services \nviolates  the  ADA,  and  specifically  the  \"Integration  Mandate\" \nimplementing  the  ADA  as  found  in  28  C.F.R.  §  35.130{d)  which \nrequires  that:  \"a  public  entity  shall  administer  services, \nprograms,  and activities in the most  integrated setting appropriate \nto  the  needs  of  qualified  individuals  with  disabilities.\" \n49.  The  ADA  also  prohibits  discrimination  in  access  to \ncovered  services  that  are  based  on  either  severity of  disability, \nor  diagnosis. \n50.  DCF  has  engaged  in  diagnosis  based  decision  making  with \ntheir  actions  to  deny  or  limit  access  to  benefits,  services  and \nopportunities  because  the  person  has  a  particular  disability, \nimpairment  or  diagnosis. \nSECOND  CAUSE  OF  ACTION \nSECTION  504  OF  THE  REHABILITATION  ACT  OF  1973 \n51.  Defendants  receive  federal  funds  and  are  therefore \nsubject  to  the  requirements  of  Section  504  of  the  Rehabilitation \nAct  of  1973  (Section  504),  29  U.S.C.  §  794. \n52.  Plaintiffs  meet  the  definition  of  having  a  \"handicap\" \nwithin  the  meaning  of  29  U.S.C.  §  706(7)  and  are  otherwise \nqualified  individuals  under  Section  504. \n53.  Defendants'  practices,  policies and procedures  described \nabove,  violate  the  rights of plaintiffs and  class members  that  are \n13 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 1    Entered on FLSD Docket 05/14/1998   Page 14 of 18\nsecured by Section 504  by discriminating against  these  individuals \nsolely on  the  basis  of  disability. \nTHIRD  CAUSE  OF  ACTION \nPROCEDURAL  DUE  PROCESS  AND  SECTION  1983 \n54.  Plaintiffs'  eligibility  for  and  receipt  of  Medicaid \nservices creates a  property right subject to due process protection \nunder  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  Constitution  of  the  United \nStates. \n55.  Florida's  Home  and  Community-Based  Waiver  specifically \nprovides  for  a  fair  hearing,  as  required  by  42  C.F.R.  Part  431, \nsubpart E,  to Medicaid recipients who  are denied the  services(s)  of \ntheir choice  or  the  provider(s)  of  their choice. \n56.  Defendants  have  not  provided  any  procedural  protections \nfor  plaintiffs  and  class  members. \n57.  By  denying  plaintiffs and  class  members  the  opportunity \nfor  a  fair  hearing  to  challenge  the  termination  of  Home  and \nCommunity Based Waiver  and  for  continued benefits,  defendants  have \nviolated the  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth Amendment  to the \nConstitution  of  the  United  States,  federal  Medicaid  law  and \nregulations,  and  the  terms  of  Florida's  Home  and  Community-Based \nWaiver. \nFOURTH  CAUSE  OF  ACTION \n42  U.S.  C.  §  1396a(8)  and  42  U.S.C.  §  1983 \n58.  Defendants  fail  to provide HCBW  services with reasonable \npromptness  in  violation  of  42  U.S.C.  §  1936a(8)  and  42  U.S.C.  § \n1983. \n14 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 1    Entered on FLSD Docket 05/14/1998   Page 15 of 18\nFIFTH  CAUSE  OF  ACTION \n42  U.S.C.  §  1396n  and  42  u.s.c.  §  1983. \n59.  Serving  individuals  in  institutions  is  contrary  to  the \nletter and  intent  of  42  U.S.C.  §  1396n. \n60.  Defendants  fund  institutional placements using the Home \nand  Community-Based Waiver.  Such  a  use  of HCBW  funds  violates  the \nexclusion  of  institutional  programs  from  the  Home  and  Community \nBased  Waiver  program  and  therefore  violates  42  U.S.C.  §  1396n  and \n42  u.s.c.  §  1983. \nSIXTH  CAUSE  OF  ACTION \n4 2  U. S . C .  §  13 9 6 n ( 2 ) (a)  and  4 2  U . S . C .  §  19 8 3 \n61.  Defendants  are  violating  42  U.S.C.  §  1396n(2) (a)  and  42 \nU.S. C.  §  1983  by  providing  inadequate  funds  for  the  Home  and \nCommunity-Based  Waiver.  Defendants  do  not  provide  sufficient \nresources  to protect  the  health and welfare  of  individuals provide \nservices  under  the  waiver.  42  U.S.C.  §  1396n(2) (A) \nSEVENTH  CAUSE  OF  ACTION \n42  U.S.C.  §  1396n(c) (2)  and  42  U.S.C.  §  1983 \n62.  Defendants  have  violated  42  U.S.C.  §  1396n(c) (2)  by \ndenying  plaintiffs  their  freedom  of  choice  of  an  appropriate  Home \nand  Community-Based  Waiver  program  that  meets  their  health  and \nwelfare  needs. \n63.  Defendants  provide  only  limited  services  to  individuals \nto  remain  in  their  own  homes,  family  homes  or  community  homes. \n64.  By  giving  individuals  a  choice  between  the  kinds  of \nservices  at  the  same  amount  of  funding,  individuals  have  a  true \n15 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 1    Entered on FLSD Docket 05/14/1998   Page 16 of 18\nchoice. \n65.  Defendants  are  therefore  in  violation  of  42  U.S. C.  § \n1396n(c) (2)  and  42  U.S.C.  §  1983. \nPRAYER  FOR  RELIEF \nWHEREFORE,  plaintiffs pray  that  this  Court: \nA.  Assume  jurisdiction of  this  action. \nB.  Order that plaintiffs may  maintain this action as  a \nclass  action pursuant  to  Rule  23,  Fed.R.Civ.P. \nC.  Declare  defendant's  threatened  termination  of  Home \nand  Community  Based  Waiver  Services  under  the  Medicaid  program \nwithout  advance  notice  and  an  opportunity  for  a  pre-termination \nhearing  and  continued  benefits  unlawful. \nD.  Award  plaintiffs  their  costs  and  reasonable \nattorneys'  fees. \nE.  Grant  such  other  and  further  relief  as  the  Court \ndeems  just and  proper. \n16 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 1    Entered on FLSD Docket 05/14/1998   Page 17 of 18\nRespectfully  submitted, \n(\\ \n~,. \n__/  '  ' \nt<-f'-~~t~ \nX \n~GuL~ETTE \nE.

As  a  result  of  the  lack  of  services  in  the  community, \nmany  individuals  are  institutionalized  or  at  risk  of \ninstitutionalization.  Many individuals regress,  losing skills that \nthey gained  from  education programs  and  therapy  services available \nto  children. \n2.  Plaintiffs seek a  declaration that denial  of  due  process \nand adequate services with reasonable promptness violates Title XIX \nof  the  Social  Security Act,  42  U.S.C.  §  1396a,  42  C.F.R  §  431.200, \net  seq.,  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act,  the  Due  Process \nClause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States \nConstitution,  and  42  U.S.C.  §  1983.  Plaintiffs  also  seek \ninjunctive  relief  to  require  defendants  to  comply  with  federal \nstatutory and  constitutional  law. \n2 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 180    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/17/1999   Page 3 of 31\nJURISDICTION \n3.  This  Court  has  jurisdiction over  this action pursuant  to \n28  U.S.C.  §§  1331  &  1343(3)  and  (4),  and  42  U.S.C.  §  1983.  This \nCourt  is authorlzed to order the  requested relief by these statutes \nand  by  28  U.S.C.  §§  2201  and  2202. \n4.  This  action  arises  under  42  U.S.C.  §  12131,  et  seq.,  29 \nU.S.C.  §  794,  and  42  U.S.C.  §  1983. \nVENUE \n5.  Venue  lS  proper  in  this  Court  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  §§ \n1391(b)  because  (1)  all defendants  reside  in districts  in Florida, \nand  defendant  Robert  S.  Cohen  reside  in  the  Southern  District  of \nFlorida  and  (2)  the  cause  of  action  arises  within  the  Southern \nDistrict of  Florida as  to  Plaintiffs Wolf  Prada-Steiman and Marlon \nChristie. \nPLAINTIFFS \n6.  WOLF  PRADO-STEIMAN  is  a  seven  year  old  boy  with  autism \nwho  presently  lives  at  home  with  his  parents  and  older  sister  in \nBroward County.  His mother applied for Medicaid Waiver Services on \nhis  behalf  and  was  provided  with  respite  in  Martin  County.  She \nnever  received any determination regarding her application for  the \nMedicaid Waiver  program.  When  his  family moved  to  Broward  County, \nhis  mother  again  applied  for  Medicaid  Waiver  service  to  address \nWolf's  behavioral  issues.  Again,  she  received  no  written \ndetermination  regarding  her  application.  Wolf  was  provided  with \nbehavioral  supports  until  April  1997  when  the  behavioral  services \n3 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 180    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/17/1999   Page 4 of 31\nvvere  termi natPd  without.  any  notice  of  appeal  rights  or  rights  to \ncontinued  benefits. \n7.  MARLON  CHRISTIE  is an  18  year old man  with cerebral palsy \nwho  lives  in  Broward  County.  He  uses  a  wheelchair  and  an \naugmentative  communication  device.  His  mother,  Opal  Millwood \ncontacted  Developmental  Services  for  Medicaid  Waiver  services  on \nhis  behalf.  She  was  told  that  there  was  a  waiting  list  for \nservices  and  that  no  services  would  be  available  for  her  son. \nBecause  Marlon  has  grown,  it is very difficult  for  her  to continue \nto  provide  him  personal  care  without  assistance.  Marlon  wants \ncompanion  services  so  that  he  can  socialize  like  other  teen-age \nboys.  He  brings  this  action  by  his  mother,  Opal  Millwood.  He \npresently does  not  have  a  legal  guardian. \n8.  LUCY  ADAWI  1s  a  50  year  old  woman  with  mild  mental \nretardation,  a  mobility  impairment,  and  a  psychiatric  disability \n(schizoaffective  disorder) .  She  presently  lives  in  Dade  County \nwith  her  mother,  Vicky  Adawi,  who  is  in  her  80s  and  has  health \nproblems.  Over  the  past  few  years,  she  has  resided  at  several \nAssisted  Living  Facilities  and  has  been  hospitalized  at  Jackson \nMemorial  Hospital.  She  needs  physical  and  occupational  therapy. \nShe  also needs  intensive  support  for  her  daily  living skills  (such \nas  bathing,  toileting,  dressing) .  Lucy  and  her  mother  want  to \ncontinue  to  live  together  but  defendants  have  refused  to  provide \nLucy with adequate  supports  to enable  her  to  live with her mother. \nFollowing  her  hospitalization  at  Jackson,  a  petition was  filed  to \ninvoluntarily  place  Lucy  Adawi.  General  Master  Lewis  S.  Kimler \n4 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 180    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/17/1999   Page 5 of 31\nfound  chat  \"Respondent's mother would  like  for  her  ro  Jive at  home, \nbut  the mother  is elderly and not  physically capable of  meeting her \ndaughter's  needs  without  in-home  supports  and  services.\"  He \nrecommended  that  she  be  involuntarily  admitted  to  residential \nservices  provided  by  defendants.  On  June  1,  1998,  the  court \nconfirmed  the  recommendation.  As  a  result  of  defendants'  failure \nto support LUCY  ADAWI  with adequate  supports,  the  court  has  ordered \nher  to be  institutionalized.  Every day without  services,  she  is at \nrisk of  harm.  She  brings  Lhis  case by  her  mothe:t- and next  friend, \nVICKY  ADAWI . \n9.  JENNIFER  BATSIDAS  is  a  22  year  old  woman  with  cerebral \npalsy who  lives  in Broward  County.  She  has  quadriplegia and  needs \nto use  a  motorized wheelchair  for  mobility.  She  lives with  her  64 \nyear  old  mother.  Defendants  refused  to  provide  her  with  any \nservices  until  after  she  was  named  as  a  plaintiff  in  the  First \nAmended  Complaint.  She  is presently receiving services on a  \"funds \navailable  basis.\"  She  is  concerned  that  her  benefits  may  be \nreduced or terminated without advance written notice and without an \nopportunity  for  continued  benefits. \n10.  DANIEL  LAVIN  is  a  22  year  old  man  with  profound  mental \nretardation  and  cerebral  palsy.  He  lives  in  Dade  County  with  his \nparents,  who  both  work.  He  has  had  nothing  to  do  since  he \ngraduated from high school  in 1997.  Defendants did not provide any \nassistance  in developing  a  transitional plan for  Daniel  as  he  aged \nout  of  the  educational  system.  Daniel  now  receives  no  services \nfrom Developmental Services.  Because his parents work,  he  is often \n5 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 180    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/17/1999   Page 6 of 31\nleft  alone  with  his  71  He  needs  bathroom \nmodifications  to make  his bathroom accessible  for him.

DANIEL  SHELL  is  a  32  year  old  man  with  moderate  mental \nretardation  and  cerebral  palsy,  who  lives  in  Brevard  County  with \nhis  parents.  His  right  side  has  dystonia  and  is  weak.  He  has  a \nbalance  problem.  He  is  on  the  Medicaid  Waiver.

His  parents  requested \nthat  the  Medicaid  Waiver  provide  him  with  the  therapy  equipment \nprescribed by  his  treating physician.  Defendants  have  refused  to \nprovide  the  equipment  and  have  not  provided  any  notice  of  due \nprocess  rights.  His  mother  wrote  a  letter requesting  an  appeal  on \nMarch  19,  1998,  and  did  not  receive  a  date  for  the  hearing  until \nJanuary  1999.  He  brings  this  case  by  his  parents,  guardian \nadvocates  and  next  friends,  Carolyn  and  Donald  Shell. \n12.  DARRYL  AUSTIN  is  a  26  year  old  man  with  cerebral  palsy. \nHe  desperately  needs  an  augmentative  communication  device.  He \nlives with his parents and usually stays with his mother during the \nday.  His  mother's  back  hurts  constantly  because  she  has  to  lift \nher son several times  a  day.  Darryl Austin needs personal  care and \n6 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 180    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/17/1999   Page 7 of 31\nrespite  ser'..rlces.  g; q  rrn~l  lS  to  li,_re  He  has \n---- ::::J---\nobtained  a  GED  and  wants  to  enroll  ln  college  to  learn  about \ncomputers.

She  lives with her parents  in \n7 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 180    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/17/1999   Page 8 of 31\nPort  Orange,  Florida.  She  receives  SSI  and  Medicaid.

The  proposed  class  consists  of  all  current  and  future \nindividuals with developmental  disabilities who  are  receiving Home \nand  Community  Based Waiver  Services  or who  are  eligible to receive \n13 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 180    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/17/1999   Page 14 of 31\nBo!!l.e  ~.nd  Co!!l.rrn_mity  Based  w~_iver  Services  or  whc·  h-3ve  2tpplied  for \nHome  and  Community  Based  Waiver  Services. \n35.  The  requirements  Fed.R.Civ.P.  Rule  23 (a)  are satisfied \n~f \nin  this  case  as  follows: \na.  Numerosity:  The  class lS  so numerous  that  joinder of all \nmembers  is  impracticable.  Upon  information  and  belief,  the  class \nconsists  of  more  than  20,000  individuals. \nb.  Commonality:  There  are  questions  of  law  or  fact  common \nto  all named  plaintiffs as  well  as  to  all members  of  the  class,  to \nwit:  whether  the  defendants'  have  violated  the  Medicaid  Act,  42 \nU.S.C.  §  1983,  and  the  Due  Process  and  Equal  Protection Clauses  of \nthe  Constitution  of  the  United  States. \nc.

R.  Civ.  P.  23 (b)  (2)  lS  also \nsatisfied.  The  defendants  have  acted or  refused  to  act  on  grounds \ngenerally  applicable  to  the  class,  thereby  making  appropriate \ndeclaratory  and  injunctive  relief  with  respect  to  the  class  as  a \nwhole.  Although  the  disabilities  of  the  class  members  vary,  they \nshare  in  common  a  need  for  services  provided  by  the  Home  and \nCommunity  Based  Waiver  Program. \nSTATUTORY  AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  FRAMEWORK \n37.  The  Medicaid  program,  established by  Title  XIX  of  the \nSocial  Security  Act,  42  U.S.C.  §  1396,  et  ~., is  a  cooperative \nfederal-state  program  to  enable  the  states  to  furnish  medical \nassistance  to  families  and  individuals  who  are  unable  to  meet  the \ncosts  of  necessary  medical  services.  42  u.s.c.  §  1396.  Costs  of \nthe  program  are  shared  by  the  federal  and  state  governments,  with \nthe  federal  government  contributing  approximately  55  per  cent  of \nthe  cost  of  services  in  Florida. \n38.  A  state  is not  obligated to participate  in the  Medicaid \nProgram.  If  a  state  elects  to  participate,  however,  it  must \noperate  its  program  1n  compliance  with  federal  statutory  and \nregulatory requirements.  42  U.S.C.  §  1396a.  Florida has  chosen to \nparticipate  in  the  Medicaid  program. \n39.  Medicaid  is  permitted  to  control  the  utilization  of \ncovered  services  through  the  application  of  a  medical  necessity \ntest.  When  applying  a  medical  necessity  standard,  the  Florida \nMedicaid  Program  must  ensure  that  recipients  with  the  most  severe \n15 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 180    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/17/1999   Page 16 of 31\ndisabilities  or  conditions  are  served  before  recipients  with  less \nsevere  disabilities.  42  C.P.R.  §  440.230(d). \n40.  State  plans  must  3lso  provide  an  opportunity  for  a  fair \nhearing  to  any  individual  whose  claim  for  medical  assistance under \nthe plan is denied or  is not  acted upon with reasonable promptness. \n42  U.S.C.  §  1396a(3)  and  42  C.P.R.  §  431.200,  et  seq. \n41.  Defendants must  mail  and give advance  notice at least ten \n( 10)  days  before  the  date  of  termination  of  or  reduction  in \niviedicaid  benefits.  45  C.F.R.  §  A  -,. ...,  ....... _..,  ...,  1  The  purpose  of  the \nLJ:_jj_. ~j_j_.-\nadvance  notice  1s  to  afford  the  recipient  of  the  service  an \nopportunity for a  pre-termination hearing.  42  C.P.R.  §  431.231{c). \nTHE  HOME  AND  COMMUNITY-BASED  WAIVER \n42.  Congress  adopted  the  Home  and  Community-Based  Waiver  in \norder  to  allow  individuals  who  would  otherwise  require  care  in  a \nnursing  home  or  ICP/DD  to  receive  services  in  their own  homes  and \nin  home-like  settings.  See  Senate  Report  No.  97-139  and  House \nConference  Report  No.  97-208,  1981  U.S.  Code  Cong.  & Admin.  News., \nat  396. \n43.  The  regulations  state  that  \"Section  1915(c)  of  the  Act \npermits  states to  offer,  under  a  waiver  of  statutory requirements, \nan  array  of  home  and  community-based  services  that  an  individual \nneeds  to  avoid  institutionalization.\"  42  C.F.R.  §  441.300 \n(emphasis  added) . \n1  There  are  limited  exceptions  to  the  advance  notice \nrequirement  at  45  C.P.R  §§431.213  and  431.214,  which  are  not \napplicable  here. \n16 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 180    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/17/1999   Page 17 of 31\n----··-\n14.

Federal  law  sets  a  ceiling for  funds  used under  the Home \nand  Community  Based  Waiver.  42  U.S.C.  §  1396n(c) (2)  (D)  requires \nthat  \"the  average  per  capita expenditure  estimated by  the  State  in \nany  fiscal  year  for  medical  assistance  provided  with  respect  to \nsuch  individual  does  not  exceed  100  percent  of  the  average  per \ncapita  expenditure  that  the  State  reasonably  estimates  would  have \nbeen  made  in  that  fiscal  year  if  the  waiver  had  not  been \ngranted.\"  Thus,  federal  law  permits  states  to  fund  Home  and \nCommunity-Based  Waiver  up  to  the  same  average  rate  as  ICF/DDs. \n46.  Congress  provided that a  Home  and Community-Based Waiver \nshall  not  be  granted  unless  the  State  provides  assurances  that \n\"necessary  safeguards  (including  adequate  standards  for  provider \nparticipation)  have  been taken to protect the health and welfare of \n17 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 180    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/17/1999   Page 18 of 31\nindividuals  provided  servicec  under  the  walver  II  -1::11: .'c1...

Congress  also  requires  that  individuals  with \ndevelopmental disabilities have  the freedom of  choice as  to whether \nto  receive  services  in  an  ICF/DD  or  under  the  Home  and  Community-\nBased  Waiver.  42  U.S.C.  §  1396n(2) (C)  provides  that  individuals \n\"who  are  determined  to  be  likely  to  require  the  level  of  care \nprovided  in  a  hospital,  nursing  facility,  or  intermediate  care \nfacility  for  the  mentally  retarded  are  informed  of  the  feasible \nalternatives,  if available under  the  waiver,  at  the  choice  of  such \nindi victuals,  to  the  provision  of  inpatient  hospital  services, \nnursing  facility  services,  or  serv1ces  in  an  intermediate  care \nfacility  for  the  mentally  retarded  (developmentally  disabled).\" \n48.  Florida first obtained approval  for a  Home  and Community-\nBased  Waiver  in  1982  for  day  treatment  services.  A  subsequent \ncomprehensive  amendment  to  Florida's  Home  and  Community-Based \nWaiver,  approved  1n  1992,  adopts  the  philosophy  of  avoiding \ninstitutional  care  and  provides  supports  and  services  to \nindividuals  with  developmental  disabilities  in  their own  homes  or \nhome-like  settings. \nDEFENDANTS'  UNLAWFUL  ACTIONS \n49.  Defendants  have  consistently  denied  individuals  with \ndevelopmental disabilities their rights to HCBW  services and to due \nprocess. \n18 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 180    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/17/1999   Page 19 of 31\n50.  a  matter  of  defendants  do  not \nplaintiffs  with  due  process  protections.  Typically,  defendants \ndeny  individuals  services,  stating  that  funds  are  not  available. \nDefendants do  not  provide notice that  the Medicaid statute provides \nfor  procedural  protections,  including  the  right  to  appeal  adverse \ndeterminations. \n51.  Defendants  routinely  take  applications  for  the  Home  and \nCommunity-Based Waiver  program but  fail  to  issue  determinations  on \nthe  applications.  Individuals  are  not  notified  that  their \napplications  have  been denied.  Individuals  are  not  given adequate \nnotice,  or any  notice,  of  the  reasons  why  the  application has  been \ndenied. \n52.  Defendants  routinely discourage  individuals from  seeking \nHCBW  services,  by  telling  them  of  lengthy  waits  for  services. \n53.  Defendants  routinely  reduce  HCBW  services  or  terminate \nHCBW  services  and  never  provide  any  notice  of  procedural \nprotections,  including  the  right  to  appeal  adverse  determinations \nand  the  right  to  continued  benefits  pending  appeal. \n54.  Defendants  fail  to  provide  individuals  with  services  1n \nthe  most  integrated  setting,  their  homes  and  community.  Instead, \ndefendants  make  services  available  only  in  institutional  setting. \nFamilies  that  care  for  their  children  at  home  do  not  even  receive \nthe most  basic  services.  For  example,  individuals  in  institutions \nwho  are  incontinent receive diapers whereas  individuals who  live at \nhome  with  their  families  are  routinely  denied  diapers. \n19 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 180    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/17/1999   Page 20 of 31\n55.  -n<-=->f-<-=>-n-n-::l-n-t-c-::-o  -Y-\"r-\"-\\1-1-1--in-<-=->~lv   r-l-o--n.1v   -in-r-l-iv-i·n-ll-:-:l-lC--!  nr-h-v..C~!.i-r-<-:..:.....l. -l  t...-... h--<-=-->r....:.....: xl;n.u.z t \noccupational  therapy,  speech therapy,  assistive technology devices \nand  services,  and  vocational  and  day  training  programs. \n56.  For many  families,  respite,  personal  care,  and  companion \nservices  are  vital  to  keep  their  family  members  home.  Yet, \ndefendants  routinely deny  these  services.  Without  these  services, \nmany  parents  are  forced  to  institutionalize  their  children. \n57.  Defendants  fail  to  ensure  that  there  are  adequate \nproviders fo:r  HCBW  services.  For example,  although dental services \nare  available  under  the  Medicaid Waiver,  there  are  no  dentists who \nare  approved  waiver  providers  in  Dade  County.  As  a  result, \nindividuals  in  Dade  County  are  routinely denied  waiver  services. \n58.  Despite  defendants'  claims  of  lack of  funds,  the  federal \nmatch  (55%)  is  available  for  HCBW  services.  Defendants  provide \nservices to individuals with developmental disabilities funded 100% \nby general  revenue  services.  Many  individuals  currently receiving \ngeneral  revenue-funded  services  are  eligible  for  the  Medicaid \nWaiver.  By using the Medicaid Waiver  for  funding,  defendants would \ngenerate federal matching funds  and increase the funds  available to \nindividuals  with  developmental  disabilities.  Nonetheless, \ndefendants  continue  to  serve  many  individuals  eligible  for  HCBW \nservices with general revenue dollars,  failing to take advantage of \nthe  federal  match. \nCLAIMS  FOR  RELIEF \nFIRST  CAUSE  OF  ACTION \nAMERICANS  WITH  DISABILITIES  ACT \n20 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 180    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/17/1999   Page 21 of 31\n59.  !ln  .llll v  l  ?  .  1 CJ CJ n  Conaress  enacted  the  Americans  with \n- -- - -·-.J.  -- I \nDisabilities  Act,  42  u.s.c.  §  12101,  et  seq.,  (ADA),  establishing \nthe  most  important  civil  rights  for  persons  with  disabilities  in \nour  nation's  history. \n60.  Congress  stated  1n  its  findings  that,  \"historically, \nsociety  has  tended  to  isolate  and  segregate  individuals  with \ndisabilities,  and,  despite  some  improvements,  such  forms  of \ndiscrimination against individuals with disabilities continue to be \na  serlous  and  pervasive  social problem.\"  42  U.S.C.  §  1210l(a) (2). \n61.  Congress  found  that  \"discrimination  against  individuals \nwith disabilities persists  in  .  institutionalization  .  and \naccess  to  public  services.\"  42  U.S.C.  §  12101 (a) (3) \n62.  Congress  found  that  \"individuals  with  disabilities \ncontinually  encounter  various  forms  of  discrimination,  including \noutright  intentional exclusion  ,  segregation,  and  relegation \nto  lesser services,  programs,  activities,  benefits,  jobs,  or other \nopportunities.\"  42  U.S.C.  §  12101 (a) (5) \n63.  Congress  further  found  that: \nindividuals with disabilities are  a  discrete and  insular \nminority  who  have  been  faced  with  restrictions  and \nlimitations,  subjected  to  a  history  of  purposeful  unequal \ntreatment,  and  relegated  to  a  position  of  political \npowerlessness  in  our  society,  based  on  characteristics  that \nare beyond  the  control  of  such  individuals  and  resulting from \nstereotypic assumptions not truly indicative of the individual \nability of  such  individuals  to participate in,  and  contribute \nto,  society. \n42  U.S.C.  §  12101(a) (7) \n64.  A  major  purpose  of  the  ADA  is  to  provide  a  clear  and \ncomprehensive  national  mandate  for  the  elimination  of \n21 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 180    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/17/1999   Page 22 of 31\ndiscriminritinn  rigriinst  inrlivirl11rilR  with  disabilities,  and  to \nprovide  clear,  strong,  consistent  and  enforceable  standards \naddressing  discrimination  against  individuals  with  disabilities. \n42  u.s.c.  §  12101(b)l&2. \n65.  Each  plaintiff  and  each  class  member  is  \"a  qualified \nindividual  with  a  dlsability\"  within  the  meanlng  of  42  U.S. C.  § \n12131(2) \n66.  The  Department  of  Children  and  Families,  the \nDevelopmental  Services  Program,  the  Medicaid program,  and  the Home \nand  Community-Based Waiver  program are  all public  services  subject \nto  Title  II  of  the  ADA,  42  U.S.C.  §§  12131-12134. \n67.  Defendants  routinely  deny  individuals  who  live  in  their \nown  homes  or with  their families  or  in community  settings  services \nsuch  as  physical  therapy,  occupational  therapy,  speech  therapy, \nconsumable  medical  supplies,  vocational  and day training programs, \nand  dental  services  that  are  available  to  individuals  who  are  in \nICF/Dds. \n68.  Defendants'  denial  of  necessary  services,  while \noffering  the  option  of  more  expensive,  institutional  services \nviolates  the  ADA,  and  specifically  the  \"Integration  Mandate\" \nimplementing  the  ADA  as  found  in  28  C.F.R.  §  35.130(d)  which \nrequires  that:  \"a  public  entity  shall  administer  services, \nprograms,  and activities in the most  integrated setting appropriate \nto  the  needs  of  qualified  individuals  with  disabilities.\" \n22 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 180    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/17/1999   Page 23 of 31\n69.  The  ADA  also  prohibits  discrimination  in  access  to \ncovered  services  that  are  based  on  either  severity of  disability, \nor  diagnosis. \n70.  Defendants  have  engaged  in  diagnosis-based  decision \nmaking  by  denying  or  limiting  access  to  benefits,  services  and \nopportunities  because  a  person  has  a  particular  disabillty, \nimpairment  or  diagnosis. \nSECOND  CAUSE  OF  ACTION \nSECTION  504  OF  THE  REHABILITATION  ACT  OF  1973 \n71.  Plaintiffs  repeat  and  reallege  paragraphs  1-59  above \nherein. \n72.  Defendants  recelve  federal  funds  and  are  therefore \nsubject  to  the  requirements  of  Section  504  of  the  Rehabilitation \nAct  of  1973  (Section  504),  29  U.S.C.  §  794. \n73.  Plaintiffs  meet  the  definition  of  having  a  11handicap11 \nwithin  the  meaning  of  29  U.S.C.  §  706(7)  and  are  otherwise \nqualified  individuals  under  Section  504. \n74.  Defendants'  practices,  policies and procedures  described \nabove,  violate  the  rights  of  plaintiffs and  class members  that  are \nsecured by Section  504  by discriminating against  these  individuals \nsolely on  the  basis  of  disability. \nTHIRD  CAUSE  OF  ACTION \nDUE  PROCESS  AND  SECTION  1983 \n75.

Part  431, \nsubpart  E,  to Medicaid recipients who  are denied the  services(s)  of \ntheir  choice  or  the  provider(s)  of  their  choice. \n78.  Defendants  have  not  provided  any  procedural  protections \nfor  plaintiffs  and  class  members. \n79.  By  denying  plaintiffs  and  class  members  the  opportunity \nfor  a  fair  hearing  to  challenge  the  termination  of  Home  and \nCommunity Based Waiver  and  for  continued benefits,  defendants  have \nviolated the  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth Amendment  to  the \nConstitution  of  the  United  States,  federal  Medicaid  law  and \nregulations,  and  the  terms  of  Florida's  Home  and  Community-Based \nWaiver. \nFOURTH  CAUSE  OF  ACTION \n42  U.S.  C.  §  1396a(8)  and  42  U.S.C.  §  1983 \n80.

Defendants  fail to provide HCBW  serv1ces with  reasonable \npromptness  in  violation  of  42  U.S.C.  §  1936a(8)  and  42  U.S.C.  § \n1983. \nFIFTH  CAUSE  OF  ACTION \n42  U.S.C.  §  1396n  and  42  U.S.C.  §  1983. \n24 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 180    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/17/1999   Page 25 of 31\nO'\"'>  and  real. l.ege \nu L. • \nherein. \n83.  Serving  individuals  in  institutions  is  contrary  to  the \nletter  and  intent  of  42  U.S.C.  §  1396n. \n84.  Defendants  fund  institutional placements  using  the Home \nand  Community-Based Waiver.  Such  a  use  of  HCBW  funds  violates  the \nexclusion  of  institutional  programs  from  the  Home  and  Community-\nBased  Waiver  program  and  therefore  violates  42  U.S.C.  §  1396n  and \n42  u.s.c.  §  1983. \nSIXTH  CAUSE  OF  ACTION \n42  U.S.C.  §  1396n(2) (a)  and  42  U.S.C.  §  1983 \n85.  Plaintiffs  repeat  and  reallege  paragraphs  1-59  above \nherein. \n86.  Defendants  are  violating  42  U.S.C.  §  1396n(2) (a)  and  42 \nu.s.c.  §  1983  by  providing  inadequate  services  to  individuals \neligible  for  Home  and  Community-Based  services  for  the  Home  and \nCommunity-Based  Waiver.  Defendants  do  not  provide  sufficient \nresources  tc protect  the  health and  welfare  of  individuals provide \nservices under  the waiver.  42  U.S.C.  §  1396n(2) (A).  As  a  result \nof  defendants'  failure  to  provide  necessary  services,  individuals \nexperience  pain,  emotional  harm,  and  regress,  losing  skills  that \nthey  had  previously  gained  from  school  and  from  therapeutic \nservices. \nSEVENTH  CAUSE  OF  ACTION \n42  U.S.C.  §  1396n(c) (2)  and  42  U.S.C.  §  1983 \n25 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 180    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/17/1999   Page 26 of 31\nR7.

Defendants  have  violated  42  U.S.C.  §  1396nlc) (2)  by \ndenying  plaintiffs  their  freedom  of  choice  of  an  appropriate  Home \nand  Community-Based  Waiver  program  that  meets  their  health  and \nwelfare  needs. \n89.  Defendants  provide  only  limited  services  to  individuals \nto  remain  in  their  own  homes,  family  homes  or  community  homes. \n90.  Without  adequate  services  available  ln  the  community, \nindividuals  are  unnecessarily  institutionalized. \n91.  Defendants  are  therefore  in  violation  of  42  U.S. C.  § \n13 9 6 n (c)  ( 2 )  and  4 2  U. S . C.  §  19 8 3 . \nEIGHTH  CAUSE  OF  ACTION \nSTATEWIDENESS  AND  42  U.S.C.  §  1983 \n92.  Plaintiffs  repeat  and  reallege  paragraphs  1-59  above \nherein. \n93.  Federal  law  requires  that  a  state Medicaid plan  shall be \nin  effect  and  in  operation  in  all  political  subdivisions  of  the \nstate.  42  U.S.C.  §  1396a(a) (1);  42  C.F.R.  §  431.50 (b)  (1). \n94.  As  a  result of defendants'  administration of the Medicaid \nHome  and  Community-Based  Waiver,  individuals  in  some  parts  of \nFlorida,  such  as  Dade  County,  do  not  have  access  to  the  complete \nrange  of  services  under  the  Home  and  Community-Based  Waiver, \nprovided  to  individuals  who  reside  in  other  counties. \n95.

Upon being apprised that the parties had executed a Settlement Agreement, the \nCourt removed the case from the trial docket, pending a proceeding to consider whether the \nSettlement Agreement should be approved. \nOn June 30, 2000, the Court issued an Order dismissing this case without prejudice. The \nOrder further provided that the Court would retain jurisdiction of the case for sixty (60) days to \nreview and approve the Agreement. \nIn 1999 and again in 2000, the Florida Legislature appropriated additional funding for \ncommunity-based services provided through the Waiver. As a result of the funding, Defendants \nhave been able to enroll more than 6,000 persons on the Waiver, and have been able to provide \nadditional Waiver services to more than 8,000 persons already enrolled on the Waiver. \nThe parties have now reached a settlement which is a fair resolution of this case. Further, \nthe Settlement avoids unnecessary utilization of scarce judicial resources that would be required \nto resolve the many complicated questions regarding the adequacy of Florida's Waiver under \nboth federal statutory mandates and the federal constitution. \n2 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 255    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/01/2000   Page 3 of 18\nI.  SUMMARY OF SETTLEMENT \nThe terms of the Settlement Agreement are designed to guide an orderly and safe \nexpansion of the Waiver, and to ensure the health and safety of those enrolled on the Waiver. \nAdditionally, the Settlement Agreement assures that individuals seeking Waiver services will \nbe provided notice of their due process rights if an adverse action is taken regarding a request \nfor Waiver services. \nThe following describes the terms of the Settlement Agreement: \nA.  By August 31, 2000,  the Department of Children and Family Services \n(Department) will complete an assessment of the need for additional Waiver providers by \nDistrict.  Upon completion of the assessment of need for providers, each District shall establish \na plan for recruiting new providers and expanding existing providers, where indicated.  The \nDistrict plans must be completed by September 15, 2000. Those plans are subject to approval \nby the Department.  Each district will be accountable for following their respective approved \nplan. \nAlso. the Department will create a statewide registry of Waiver providers by September \n15, 2000. \nB.  Effective July I, 2000, the Department shall certify all Waiver providers on a \nstatewide basis, without the necessity of certification by district. \nC.  The Settlement Agreement provides for provider training. A workgroup will be \nestablished to make recommendations as to an appropriate curriculum for provider training. The \nparties anticipate that they will be able to utilize existing curriculum for training purposes. \n3 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 255    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/01/2000   Page 4 of 18\nUltimately, the Settlement Agreement contemplates mandatory training. Short term, the training \nwill be made available on a voluntary basis (effective July I, 2001). \nThe workgroup will make recommendations for \"phasing in\" mandatory training. The \nDepartment and the Agency shall then consider the recommendations, and determine how best \nto structure a mandatory training program.  By September 2, 200 I, the Department will submit \na request to the Florida Legislature to fund competency-based training of providers. In the event \nthat funding is not appropriated for competency-based training, beginning fiscal year 2002-2003, \nthe Department will make available $200.000 per year for use in developing curriculum and \nimplementing a mandatory training program. \nThe Department and the Agency also agree to develop a protocol for medication \nadministration and handling consistent with state law.  This protocol will be available for \nimplementation by October I, 2000. Effective December I, 2000, the Department will begin to \nmodifY provider assurances for appropriate direct care workers and the providers who employ \nthem to require training on the protocol as a condition of emollment as a Waiver provider or \ncontinued emollment on the Waiver. \nD.  By March I, 2001, the Department and the Agency will revise and strengthen \ntraining requirements for Waiver Support Coordinators, to ensure that they have appropriate \ntraining on a number of topics. \nThe Department will seck funding from the 2001  Legislature for funding for a \ncompetency-based training program for Waiver Support Coordinators. \n4 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 255    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/01/2000   Page 5 of 18\nBy November I, 2000, the Department and the Agency, with input from the Advocacy \nCenter, will develop a proposal to eliminate unnecessary paper work by Waiver Support \nCoordinators. \nBy October I, 2000, the Department will establish and implement a policy for handling \ncomplaints against Waiver Support Coordinators. \nAlso, the Department and the Agency will study the issue of caseloads for Waiver \nSupport Coordinators, to  determine  what an  appropriate caseload  for  Waiver Support \nCoordinators might be, and to determine an appropriate \"mix of cases\" for a Waiver Support \nCoordinator.  The term \"mix of cases\" refers to the number of clients for which a Waiver \nSupport Coordinator provides more intensive case management services, in comparison to the \nnumber of clients for which a Waiver Support Coordinator provides more routine case \nmanagement services. \nThe Department and the Agency will also study support coordination rates, and \ndetermine whether an enhanced support coordination rate is appropriate where more intensive \ncase management services are required. If feasible, in the sole discretion ofthe Defendants, the \nDepartment and the Agency will submit a request to the Governor and the Florida Legislature, \nby September I, 200 I, for funding to support the enhanced rate. Also, by September I, 200 I, \nthe Department and the Agency will submit a recommendation to the Florida Legislature \nregarding an appropriate \"mix of cases.\" \nE.  The Settlement Agreement requires the creation of a Quality Assurance System. \nThe Legislature has directed the Agency for Health Care Administration to contract with an \n5 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 255    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/01/2000   Page 6 of 18\noutside entity to perform quality assurance monitoring of Waiver services.  The Request For \nProposal for the quality assurance will be issued by December 31, 2000. \nIn the absence of a bid protest or administrative challenge to the award of the contract, \nthe Department and the Agency agree that they will begin implementation of the Quality \nAssurance system within sixty (60) days after execution of the contract. \nBy September 30, 2000, a contractor retained by the Department will conduct an \nevaluation to determine how the Department can best provide medical quality assurance services \nin all of the Districts. As a result of that evaluation, the Department will develop a uniform plan \nof medical case management. The Department will implement medical case management in the \ndistricts by December 31, 2000. \nThe parties also agree that citizen monitors will be used to assist in monitoring Waiver \nservices. \nF.  By December I. 2001, the Department will substantially complete choice \ncounseling for all individuals who live and receive Waiver services at the residential habilitation \ncenters (large group homes with more than 15 beds).  The focus of the choice counseling will \nbe alternative residential placement options.  In order to ensure that individuals have a \nmeaningful choice of residential placement options, the Department will work toward developing \nalternative residential placements. \nIf a vacancy occurs in the residential habilitation centers, the vacancy will not be filled \nwith an individual enrolled on the Waiver.  Two residential habilitation centers are exempted \nfrom this requirement. Carlton Palms and F.I.N.R.S.  However. beginning six (6) months after \nthe approval of the Settlement Agreement by the Court (and every six months thereafter), the \n6 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 255    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/01/2000   Page 7 of 18\nDepartment agrees to review each Waiver placement in Carlton Palms and F.I.N.R.S. to \ndetermine whether the placement continues to be medically necessary. \nG.  The Settlement Agreement establishes service delivery time lines. During the \ncourse of this fiscal year (2000-2001), the Department agrees that. subject to availability of a slot \nand funding for the slot, it will incrementally enroll 3,889 persons on the Waiver, consistent with \nthe Spending Plan previously submitted to the Legislature. \nEffective the date that this Settlement Agreement is approved by the Court and \ncontinuing until June 30, 2001. the Department will make reasonable efforts to provide those \nrequested Waiver services for which a determination of medical necessity has been made within \nninety (90) days of the date of the individual's enrollment on the Waiver, to the extent that \nsufficient provider capacity exists. \nThe Department is in the process of completing an applications policy for the Waiver. \nThe expected date for completion of the policy is September 1, 2000. \nEffective July I, 2001. the Department will enroll eligible individuals on the Waiver \nwith reasonable promptness, to the extent that a Waiver slot and funding for that slot exist. The \nDepartment will also provide medically necessary Waiver services to enrolled individuals with \nreasonable promptness. \nThe Settlement Agreement establishes time frames for processing an application for \nWaiver services, notifying the client of action on the application. requesting a Waiver Support \nCoordinator, completion of a support plan and cost plan, and initiation of services, with which \nthe Department agrees to substantially comply.  For individuals who are both Medicaid \nrecipients and Developmental Services (DS) clients, medically necessary services should be \n7 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 255    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/01/2000   Page 8 of 18\nprovided within ninety (90) days after receipt of the application for Waiver services -to the \nextent that the individual is eligible for the Waiver, and a slot and funding exist to enroll the \nindividual on the Waiver. \nAdditional time frames are provided for a determination of Medicaid eligibility (90 \ndays) and DS eligibility (consistent with state law)-however, if a person is neither Medicaid \neligible nor DS eligible at the time of application for Wavier services, the time frames run \nconcurrently. \nFor individuals in crisis, the Department will make reasonable efforts to provide \nnecessary services as quickly as possible. \nH.  By December 31, 2001, the Waiver Support Coordinators will be required to \nprovide service counseling to all Waiver clients currently in sheltered workshops or segregated \nwork environments to apprise them of the options available to them for meaningful work \nactivities. \nThe Department will enhance adult day training standards to assure or reemphasize that \nmeaningful day activities relate to the person achieving his or her life goals.  The Advocacy \nCenter will have input into the proposed modification of provider assurances. The Department \nwill implement modification of provider assurances with the provider enrollment cycles \nbeginning on or after July I, 200 I. \nI.  The Department agrees that, by November 30, 2000, it will conduct and complete \na rate and standardization study (rate study) relating to provider rates. The purpose of this study \nwill be to determine the methodologies currently being used to set rates. and to develop \n8 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 255    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/01/2000   Page 9 of 18\nappropriate rate setting methodologies for different provider types.  The rate study will include \nconsideration of the cost of provider training. \nAfter completion of the rate study, but no earlier than January I, 200 I, based upon the \nfindings of the rate study, the Department agrees to provide a rate adjustment increase of up to \n3% to equitably increase rates to providers, to the extent that funds are available in Specific \nAppropriation 344. To the extent that the rate study reflects a need for rate adjustment increases, \nthe direct care workers shall be paid a 3% raise first. \nBy November 30, 2000, the Agency and the Department will submit the results of the \nrate study to the Florida Legislature for consideration during the 2001 Session.  Further, the \nAgency and the Department agree to use their best efforts to obtain any additional funding from \nthe Legislature for the rate study, and to implement the recommendations of the rate study, \nincluding equitable changes to minimize disparities in provider rates among the same provider \ntypes. \nIf additional funding is required to implement the results of the rate study, over and \nabove what has been authorized for the 2000-200 I fiscal year, the parties understand that full \nimplementation of the rate study is subject to Legislative funding. \nJ.  The Department agrees to substantially comply with the most current version of \nits Due Process Policy as it relates to both individuals requesting enrollment on the Waiver and \nindividuals on the Waiver requesting Waiver services. \nK.  By June 30. 2001, the Department and the Agency will publish a Waiver \nhandbook which will establish statewide policies regarding administration of the Waiver. \n9 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 255    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/01/2000   Page 10 of 18\nIn the interim, as a need is identified to create and implement statewide policies on \nparticular issues, the Department, in conjunction with the Agency, agrees that it will issue \nwritten interim policies to address these needs. \nL.  The Department agrees that it will translate the Florida Status Tracking Survey \n(FSTS) into both Spanish and Creole, as quickly as possible, but no later than November I, \n2000. Upon completion of the translation, the Department intends to allow Spanish and Creole \nspeaking consumers, and their families, to provide input regarding the accuracy of the \ntranslations. This may necessitate further revisions, so that the translated versions of the FSTS \naccurately communicate the necessary information. The Department anticipates that it will be \nable to fully implement the translated versions of the FSTS (with any necessary revisions). by \nno later than January 31. 2001. \nFurther. the Department will exercise its best efforts to ensure that interviewers who \nmeet with clients (and families), who do not speak English, but rather speak Spanish or Creole. \nbe able to competently communicate in Spanish or Creole as indicated. \nM.  The court will retain jurisdiction in this lawsuit until December 31. 2001, at \nwhich time the matter will be dismissed with prejudice, unless plaintiffs can show a material \nbreach as evidenced by systemic deficiencies in the Defendants' implementation of the plan of \ncompliance. Prior to filing a motion asserting material breach, plaintiffs must comply with the \nnotice and cure provisions contained in the agreement. \n10 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 255    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/01/2000   Page 11 of 18\nII.  STAN PARD FOR APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT FOR CLASS ACTION \nLITIGATION \nThe standards to be applied in determining whether to approve a class action settlement \nare well-established. \"Compromises of disputed claims are favored by the Courts.\" Williams v. \nFirst National Bank, 216 U.S. 582, 595 (1910). Nowhere is this policy more appropriate than \nin class actions. \nIn the class action context in particular, \"there is an overriding public interest in favor \nof settlement.\" Cotton v. Hinton, 559 F.2d 1326. 1331 (5th Cir. 1977). Settlement of complex \ndisputes often involved in class actions minimizes the litigation expenses of both parties and also \nreduces the strain such litigation imposes upon already scarce judicial resources. Arrnstron~ v. \nBoard of School Directors. 616 F.2d 305. 313, (7th Cir. 1980); accord Franks v. roger Co., 649 \nF.2d 1216. 1224 (6th Cir. 1981). \nUnder the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a court should approve a class action \nsettlement if it is \"fair, adequate and reasonable.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e); accord. Piambino v. \nBailey, 757 F.2d 1112, 1139 (11th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1169 (1986); Protective \nCommittee v. Anderson, 390 U.S. 414,434 (1968). In assessing a proposed settlement, \"[c]ourts \njudge the fairness of a proposed compromise by weighing the plaintiffs likelihood of success on \nthe merits against the amounts and form of the relief offered in the settlement.\" Carson v \nAmerican Brands Inc., 450 U.S. 79, 88 n. 14 (1981). \nThe Eleventh Circuit has enumerated a number of elements which a district court may \nconsider in evaluating the fairness of a class settlement, including the following: \n(I)  the likelihood of success at trial; \n(2)  the range of possible recovery; \n11 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 255    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/01/2000   Page 12 of 18\n(3)  the point on or below the range of possible recovery at which a \nsettlement is fair, adequate and reasonable; \n(4)  the complexity, expense and duration oflitigation; \n(5)  the substance and amount of opposition to the settlement; and \n(6)  the stage of proceedings at which the settlement was achieved. \nBennett v. Behring, 737 F.2d 982, 986 (lith Cir. 1984).  Despite the multitude of factors \nidentified above, courts should \"not decide the merits of the case or resolve unsettled legal \nquestions.\" Carson v. American Brands Inc., 450 U.S. 79,88 n. 14 (1981) \nIn appraising the fairness of a proposed settlement, the view of experienced counsel \nfavoring a settlement is entitled to significant weight. See Ressler v. Jacobson, 822 F. Supp. \n1551, 1552 (M.D. Fla. 1992) citing Cotton v. Hinton, 559 F.2d 1326, 1330-1332 (5th Cir. 1977). \nIn reviewing a settlement, the court should be \"hesitant to substitute his or her own judgment \nforthat of counsel.'' In re Smith, 926 F.2d 1027, 1028 (lith Cir. 1991). A judge must \"'guard \nagainst the temptation to become an advocate\"' and should favor neither party nor \"'those who \nare opposed or absent.'\" !d., at 1029. Nor should the court disapprove a settlement because of \n\"generalized notions of unfairness or unacceptability.\" !d. \nThe Settlement in this case was the result of non-collusive, intensive negotiations by \ncounsel who are seasoned litigators with many years of experience in comparable litigation. \nA.  Class Counsel are Experienced \nPlaintiffs were represented by an experienced tean1 of attorneys from the Advocacy \nCenter for Persons with Disabilities, Inc. Peter L. Nimkoffhas practiced law extensively in this \nCourt and served as a United States Magistrate from 1982-1986.  Since September 1996, Mr. \nNimkoffhas been the Litigation Director or Chief Counsel at the Advocacy Center. Ellen M. \n12 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 255    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/01/2000   Page 13 of 18\nSaideman is an experienced lawyer in the field of class action litigation and litigation involving \nindividuals with developmental disabilities. \nB.  Class Counsel Support Approval of the Settlement \nAfter full review and analysis of the evidence and legal issues, Plaintiffs' counsel are \nsatisfied that this Settlement confers significant, concrete benefits upon the class members and \nis fair, reasonable and adequate in light of the complexity, delay and possible risks attendant to \ncontinued litigation. There is strong judicial policy favoring settlement as well as the realization \nthat compromise is the essence of settlement. Bennett v. Behring Corp, 737 F.2d 982, 986(11 th \nCir. 1984); U.S v. City of Miami, 614 F.2d 1322 (5th Cir. 1980); Florida Trailer and Equipment \nCo. v. Deal, 284 F.2d 567, 571 (5th Cir. 1960). \nFurther, this Settlement is a deviation from the long held policy of the State of Florida \nnot to permit continued federal court jurisdiction. This Court is well aware that the Governor and \nthe Attorney General have taken the position that the State of Florida will not enter into any \nstipulated settlements or consent decrees where any court retains jurisdiction. \nlL  EVALUATION OF THE SETTLEMENT \nExamining the Settlement in light of the criteria outlined above, it must be concluded \nthat it is fair, adequate, reasonable and in the best interest of the class. \nA.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nThe State has made a number of changes in the administration of the Waiver since this \nlawsuit was filed.  Further, significant new funding appropriated by the Florida Legislature for \nfiscal years 1999-2000 and 2000-200 I has enabled the Defendants to provide needed services \nto individuals already enrolled on the Waiver. and to enroll over 6,000 new persons on the \n13 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 255    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/01/2000   Page 14 of 18\nWaiver already.  This is an action for injunctive and declaratory relief only. and includes no \naction for damages.  Such relief is prospective in nature.  In light of increased funding for the \nWaiver, the ongoing expansion of the Waiver, and increases in the delivery of Waiver services, \nthe Court must, in evaluating Plaintiffs' claims determine, among other things, whether there \nexists a likelihood that plaintiffs will suffer future harm at the hands of defendants. Cone Corp. \nv. Florida Dept. ofTransp., 921 F.2d 1190,1204 (lith Cir. 1991). \nThe order certifying class is on appeal. In order to appeal that order, the Defendants had \nto obtain permission from the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals to file the appeal.  That \npermission was given, suggesting that the appeal was not fiivolous in nature.  An adverse \ndecision on appeal might have significantly narrowed the class and the issues which remained \nfor class resolution. \nSimilarly. Defendants believe that Plaintiffs' claims are barred by the Eleventh \nAmendment to the United States Constitution, and would have challenged Plaintiffs' statutory \nclaims under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794, and Title II of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134. and particularly the use \nof those statutes to suggest that the state is affirmatively obligated to provide services to \nindividuals for their disabilities in order to avoid institutionalization. Although Plaintiffs believe \n14 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 255    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/01/2000   Page 15 of 18\nthat they would prevail on these issues,' there is the attendant risk that the Eleventh Circuit might \nhold the Eleventh Amendment bars the requested relief. \nB.  Range of Possible Recovery \nThe parties believe that the Settlement Agreement provides a broader range of recovery \nthan might otherwise be available in this case.  The central issues in the Second Amended \nComplaint were the lack of funding to provide needed Waiver services, the failure to provide due \nprocess notice when Waiver services were denied, delays which class members experienced in \nreceiving Waiver services, and the scope of Waiver services provided. Thus, any injunctive and \ndeclaratory relief would be directed to those issues.  However, the Settlement Agreement goes \nbeyond the issues pleaded in the Second Amended Complaint, including matters such as provider \ntraining, quality assurance, the training of Waiver Support Coordinators, provider rates, the \nnature of adult day training programs and supported employment programs (as distinct from the \navailability of such programs), and other miscellaneous issues. \nC.  Fairness. Adequacy and Reasonableness of the Settlement \nThe determination of \"reasonable\" settlement is not susceptible to a mathematical \nequation yielding a particularized sum.  As the court explained:  \"[T]here is a range of \n'!See Olmstead v. L. C. by Zimring, 527 U.S. 581, 119 S.Ct. 2176, 144 L.Ed.2d 540 (1999); \nHelen L. v. DiDario. 46 F .3d 325 (3d Cir. 1995), cert denied, 116 S.Ct. 64 ( 1995)(holding that \nthe ADA required DPW to place plaintiff in an attendant care program in the community as it \nwas the most integrated setting to meet her needs); Martin v. Voinovich, 840 F. Supp. 1175, 1192 \n(S.D. Ohio 1993) (refusing to dismiss claims that state violated Section 504 and ADA by \nexcluding people with severe disabilities from community programs); and Jackson v. Fort \nStanton School & Hospital, 757 F.Supp. 1243, 1299 (D. N.M. 1990) (holding that defendants \nviolated Section 504 by failing to integrate persons with severe disabilities into community \nprograms). \n15 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 255    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/01/2000   Page 16 of 18\nreasonableness with respect to a settlement ... \" Newman v. Stein, 464 F.2d 689, 693 (2d Cir.), \ncert. denied, 409 U.S. I 039 ( 1972). \nIn the instant case, the Settlement Agreement is imminently reasonable because it \nensures that the expansion of the Waiver occurs in a safe and effective manner, and that the \nindividuals served through the Waiver are provided with medically necessary services with \nreasonable promptness.  The Settlement Agreement ensures that there are quality assurance \nmechanisms to oversee the operation of the Waiver. Also, the Settlement Agreement ensures \nthat the Due Process policy now in place will be followed. \nD.  Complexity. Expense and Duration of Litigation \nThe complexity of the factual and legal issues involved in this litigation cannot be \nunderestimated. The case deals with a variety of services to persons on the Waiver, and persons \nwho wish to be enrolled on the Waiver. There are over 18,000 persons on the Waiver alone. \nThe expense of continuing to litigate would be substantial. Plaintiffs' litigation costs \nare anticipated to be extensive. \nThe parties emphatically prefer to devote these resources to productively meeting the \nhuman needs of the class of individuals who need to be served. \nEven if the class obtained a favorable decision and it was upheld on appeal, the class \nwould not be assured of a judgment more favorable than the present settlement, particularly in \nview of the likelihood of extensive appeals. In addition to the complexity and expense of \ncontinued litigation regarding remedy, the Court must also consider the potential impact on \nscarce judicial resources. In the absence of this  Settlement, the class might receive fewer \nbenefits, even assuming a favorable decision, for years. Cf Ressler v. Jacobson, 822 F. Supp. \n16 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 255    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/01/2000   Page 17 of 18\n1551, 1553-55 (noting that litigation of these types of cases often consumes extensive judicial \nresources). \nThe Parties agree that the time and expense of continued litigation is to be avoided, if \nat all possible. \nE.  Stage of Proceedings at which the Settlement was Achieved \nThe purpose of considering the stage of the proceedings is to ensure that Plaintiffs have \nhad access to sufficient information to evaluate the case and to assess the adequacy of a \nsettlement proposal with an informed judgement of the strengths and weaknesses of their \nposition. ~ In re General Motors Corp., 846 F. Supp. 330, 334-35 (E. D. Pa. I 993). In the \ninstant case, there has been extensive discovery over the past two years. Plaintiffs have had the \nopportunity to depose Defendants· fact and ex pen witnesses, to the extent that they chose to do \nso.  Plaintiffs have had an opportunity to review thousands of pages of documents relating to \nDefendants' case. The Settlement Agreement was executed only eleven (II) days prior to the \ntrial. \nAdditionally, the settlement discussions have included numerous discussions relating \nto the viability of the different claims brought by plaintiffs. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Parties respectfully request that the Court enter an order approving the Stipulation \nof Settlement for all of the foregoing reasons, after a fairness hearing. \n17 \n\nCase 0:98-cv-06496-PAS   Document 255    Entered on FLSD Docket 08/01/2000   Page 18 of 18\nRespectfully submitted, \n\\1~y-,N~~~ \nSTEPHANIE A.
