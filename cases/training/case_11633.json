    "summary": "<p>On April 20, 2006, a severely physically disabled individual requiring hospital-level care filed a lawsuit under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act against various Illinois state officials in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.  The Plaintiff, represented by Equip for Equality, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief requiring the state to provide nursing and home services at the level he received before turning twenty-one years old.</p><p>Because he turned twenty-one, Plaintiff's in-home care was funded by the Medically Fragile Technology Dependent Children's (MFTDC) waiver.  However, once he turned twenty-one, Plaintiff's care was funded by the PWD waiver, which provided drastically fewer hours of in-home care.  Despite this reduction in benefits, Plaintiff has remained at home in the care of his parents.  However, Plaintiff's parents are not able to continue to care for him around-the-clock.</p><p>The case was originally set for a bench trial in October 2007.  However, it became clear after opening statements that the only disputed issue was the applicability of the integration mandate - a pure question of law - so the court ordered summary judgment briefing.  Defendant argued that the state was under no obligation to fund hospital-level care for Plaintiff under the PWD waiver.  Plaintiff claimed that HFS is indeed obligated to provide adequate funding for home care as long as home care is appropriate and cost-neutral.  On May 30, 2008, the Court (Judge Rebecca R. Pallmeyer) denied Defendant Maram's motion for summary judgment.  Grooms v. Maram, 563 F.Supp.2d 840 (N.D.

Background on the Illinois Medicaid Program \nThe Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS) is responsible for\nproviding health care coverage for adults and children who qualify for Medicaid, and for \nproviding Child Support Enforcement services to help ensure that Illinois children receive financial \nsupport from both parents. The Division of Medical Programs within HFS administers \nthe Medical Assistance Programs, which provide health care coverage to low-income fami lies \nlacking health insurance, children who are wards of the state, low-income senior citizens, \nindividuals with disabilities, elderly  in nursing facilities and p eople struggling with \ncatastrophic medical bills. \nIllinois has a Medicaid State Plan, approved by the  Centers for Medicare an d Medicaid\nServices (CMS) that specifies the healthcare services available to all Medicaid eligible \nindividuals. In addition to services in the State Plan, illinois opera tes several Medicaid homeand\ncommunity-based (HCBS) \"waiver\" programs. Medicaid HCBS waiver programs allow \nqualified individuals to receive care in their own home or other community setting as an \nalternative to a nursing facility or other institutional setting. Individuals in a waiver program \nhave access to specified services that are not generally included in Medicaid State Plans, \nincluding services such as homemaker, personal assistant, and home delivered meals, among \nothers. In addition to these services, waiver recipients are able to access Medicaid State Plan \nservices, such as physician visits, hospital stays, etc. For state waiver programs to be eligible for \nFederal matching funds, Federal regulations require that waiver programs be cost neutral, th at is, \nservices provided to waiver recipients must cost no more than services that would be \nprovided to the same individuals were they to be served in institutional settings. \nPhysically disabled persons in the Ill inois Medicaid program who require a  nursing\nfacility level of care generally receive services in one of two ways: 1) care is provided in a \nnursing facility or similar type of institutional setting; or, 2) care is provided at home or in a \nPage 2 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 62-4      Filed 05/29/2007     Page 5 of 39\n \nt\n, \n',w,W,,,\"\",,\"\"'W,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,'mN',,,,,,',\"\"\"\"\"\",\"',''''''''\",'''''''W\"'.w,,,\"'''W,'.wAWNM','''WN',,\"W,,\"''''''''WN,,,,''''''''','''''Wm.wN,\"\",,,,,,,,,\"',,',,,\",'W.w,W,,W,'W,\"\",,\"W.w,,w.w,,,m,W,W,'\" \nGrooms v.

Disabled children may receive services in\neither an institutional or an HCBS setting and are eligible to receive additional \nservices through the Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) program. \nUnder the EPSDT program, children can receive services that are not included in the Illinois \nMedicaid State Plan, but that are deemed medically necessary for the child's treatment. \nIllinois' Medicaid HCBS Waiver Programs \nIllinois' Medicaid HCBS  waiver programs are administered by HFS as the Medicaid\nagency, but several of the waiver programs are operated by the Division of Rehabilitation \nServices (DRS), a division of the Illinois Department of Human Services (DHS). \nIllinois has seven HCBS waiver programs: \nLevel of Institutional \nOperating State \nWaiver  Care Required by \nAgency \nWaiver Recipients \n1) Medically Fragile/  Hospital / Skilled  University of Illinois, \nTechnology Dependent  Pediatric Facility  Division of \nChildren (MFTD)  Specialized Care for \nChildren (DSCC) \n2)  Persons  with  Disabilities  3)  DH5-DRS DHS-DRS \nPersons with Brain InjurJ  DH5-Division of \n4) Adults with Developmental  Developmental \nDisabilities  Disabilities Services \n5) Persons Who are Elderly 6)  Department of A . \nPersons with HIV or AIDS 7)  DH5-DRS HFS-\nSupported Living Facilities  Bureau of Long Term \nCare \nPage 3\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 62-4      Filed 05/29/2007     Page 6 of 39\n \n't \n.W, , ,, ,W,,-,,,,,,,wm,,,,,,,,,,W,,,,.,,,,,--,,,WW,,W, ,,,,,W,. ,,,,w,,,,,,.w.,,,,w,,,..w, , ,WW,.. .,.¥,.W, W ,.m..,.....................................................................................,,,wmoW .W,,.\nGrooms v.

To qualify for this waiver, individuals \nmust need a level of care equivalent to that provided in a skilled pediatric facility \n(licensed as an ICF/MR) or a hospital. Participants in the waiver program have a dollar limit on the\namOtmt of services they can receive. This limit, which applies to each waiver recipient, is \nequal to 125% of the ave rage per diem expenditure for hospital care in the previous fiscal  year.!\nApproximately 530 children participated in the MFTD Waiver during the time period \nSeptember I, 2003 through August 31, 2004. During that same period, it cost approximately $2\nmillion to provide waiver services and the EPSDT program spent an additional $49 million to \nprovide nursing services to children in the MFTD Waiver. \nPersons with Disabilities Waiver \nThe Persons with Disabilities Waiver is for Medicaid-eligible individuals under age 60. To \nqualify for this program, individuals must need a level of care equivalent to that provided in \na nursing facility. Participants in the waiver program also have a dollar limit, which is generally \nreferred to as a Service Cost Maximum (SCM). The SCM limits the cost of the service \nplan a waiver recipient can receive. The SCM is  determined for each waiver applicant by way o f \nan assessment tool, referred to as the Determination of Need (DON). Higher DON scores \ngenerally correspond with higher SCMs. A service plan, which sets out the allowed waiver \nservices, is developed by DRS for each waiver recipient. The service plans are tailored to the \nspecific medical conditions and needs of the recipients. These service plans are designed to \n1 The limit for ventilator dependent children is equal to the greater of: 1) 125% of the average per diem expenditure for \nhospital care in the previous fiscal year, or 2) 100% of the average per diem cost of the institution from which they were \nplaced. \nPage 4 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 62-4      Filed 05/29/2007     Page 7 of 39\n \n, \n\".,\",w.w.w.................W.W.WW.,\".'.ww.'.\"w.,\".w.'.,,,,,,,,,,\".'.,'.,,,,\"W.\"W.W.W.W.\"'''W.'.'\".'''''''''\"'''.'''''''W.'.'.''W.W.WN.''.'.''''.'.W.'''W..'.W'--W.''W.'.'.'.w.w.w.wmw,..\",\"...\"\",...w,\"mw-,,\"'.\"..w.,,,,,wmm.,w..\nGrooms v; Maram \nExpert Report of Todd D.

Approximately 20,000 \nadults participated in the Persons with Disabilities Waiver during the time period October 1, \n2003 through September 30, 2004. During that same period, it cost approximately $175 million to\nprovide waiver services to persons in the Persons with Disabilities Waiver. \nIllinois Nursing Facilities \nThere are over 700 nursing facilities p articipating in the illinois  Medicaid program. HFS\nreimburses nursing facilities on a per diem basis for days of care provided to Medicaid \nrecipients. The per diem rates vary by facility and averaged approximately $95 per day as of Fall\n2006, however, Illinois recently revised its rate setting methodology for nursing facilities, \nwhich resulted in new per diem rates effective January 1, 2007.2 The average of these new rat es\nincreased to approximately $100 per day. \nIII. Nature of the Dispute \nThe Plaintiff in this matter is David Grooms. I understand that David has quadriplegia and\nis ventilator dependent. David received services through illinois' MFTD Waiver program \nuntil he reached age 21 in October 2005. I unde rstand that through the MFTD Waiver,  David\nreceived nursing services at home from RNs and LPNs that cost approximately $16,000 per \nmonth as well as respite  care costing approximately $1,000 per month. Nursing services in the  \nMFTD Waiver are generally funded by EPSDT, which was described in Section II above. \nOnce David reached age 21, he was no longer eligible for the MFTD Waiver. In late 2005, \nDRS developed a service plan for David under the Persons with Disabilities Waiver. The \nPersons with Disabilities Waiver has different (lower) SCMlevels (as a result of different cost \n2 Prior to the rate setting change, nursing facilities could receive\" exceptional care rates\" for services provided to certain \nindividuals with special needs, The $95 per day average rate does not include consideration of individuals receiving \nexceptional care rates. With the change in the rate setting system, exceptional care rates were eliminated. \nPage 5 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 62-4      Filed 05/29/2007     Page 8 of 39\n , \n~W\".\"''''''W.''W.w,'','''~''_WM'~''._W.\",,,.'.,,,,,,,,.........................................................W.W.W.,,W,'''''''''OWN.O.\",,,,,,,,,W.,,,,,,,,W.o''W.'..,,,,,,,,...................................W.--o''''''WW..o.O.\"'Ww.wm.\"\"\"\"'\"''\",\"MW.'W.''''''''''''''.'.'''.'''--''.'''''W''''''' \nGrooms v.

Scope of Work \nI was asked by counsel to HFS to quantify the economic impact on the cost of the State's \ncurrent Persons with Disabilities Waiver program, assuming David were to prevail on his request for \nadditional home nursing services and other individuals were then also able to access \nadditional waiverservices. The two populations I was asked to evaluate are: \n1) Current nursing facility residents who potentially would move from nursing \n  facilities to community-based settings and receive services through the Persons with \nDisabilities Waiver program; and, \n2) Current Persons with Disabilities Waiver recipients who currently use services at a \n  cost that is less than their SCM. \n3 The cost neutrality comparison for the MFTD Waiver is based on the cost of hospital or skilled pediatric facility \nservices, whereas the comparison for the Persons with Disabilities Waiver is based on the cost of nursing facility services.\n4 The service plan contained, on average, approximately 12 hours per day of RN / LPN services and approximately 1 hour \nper day of personal assistance. TI1e total cost of the plan was $8,660, which is under the SCM (based on an exceptional \ncare rate) of $8,840 per month. Exceptional care rates are extended to waiver recipients on a case-by-case basis when the \nrecipient would have qualified for an exceptional care rate in a nursing facility. \n5 Defendant's Amended Answer and Affirmative Defenses to Complaint, paragraph 45.B. \n6 The costs for David's pre-21 services were approximately $17,000 per month, which is approximately twice \nthe cost of his service plan ($8,660) under the Persons with Disabilities Waiver. \nPage 6 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 62-4      Filed 05/29/2007     Page 9 of 39\n. \n \n\" \n\" \n-~\"\"~\"'A\"'~\"'''''~-'-\"\",-\"\"\",-~,................................................................................\",,,.,,,,-\".,\"..,,-,,\".\"'''''.'''W...w.\",,'''''''''-'-''''''''''''''-''''-''''-'''''''''''''-'''-m\"'~'\nGrooms v.

Menenberg \nMarch \n19, 2007 \n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"---\"\"\"'''-''''''',,''''''.m.....................'M...........................................................................................................................................................................................................m...................................................\"....................................\nIf David prevails on his request for additional hom e nursing services, the co st of David's\ncare would exceed his cost limitation under the Persons with Disabilities Waiver and would \nexceed the cost of his approved service plan for the waiver. Therefore, ifDavid were to prevail, it is \nreasonable to believe that some current nursing facility residents that have been unable to \naccess HCBS services through the Persons with Disabilities Waiver (because the cost of their \nhome-based service needs exceeded their SCM) would then be able to receive services through \nthe Persons with Disabilities Waiver. Similarly, if David prevails, it is reaso nable to believe that \ncurrent Persons with Disabilities Waiver recipients would likely access additional HCBS \nservices up to (and potentially in excess of) their SCMs.7 \nThe process I used to evaluate the two populations above and the results of my analyses are\nexplained in more detail in the following section. \nV. Process and Results \nMy colleagues and I had a series of discussions in early 2007 with a number of State \npersonnel, including attorneys and executives with HFS and DHS. Our work included \ndiscussions .w ith the following individuals: \n. \nMatt Werner - HFS, Bureau of Rate Development and Analysis \n. \nBarbara Ginder - HFS, Bureau of Interagency Coordination Kelly \n. \nCuningham - HFS, Bureau of Long Term Care \n. \nNancy Becker - HFS, Bureau of Rate Development and Analysis \n. \nSue Coomod - HFS, Bureau of Long Term Care \n. \nTeri Dederer - DHS, Division of Rehabilitation Services \n. \nJohn Huston - Office of the Attorney General \n. \nKaren Konieczny - Office of the Attorney General \nJoseph Howard - HFS, Office of General Counsel \n7 \nMy analyses of nursing facility residents and individuals currently served under the Persons with Disabilities Waiver \nare not lin1ited to individuals with quadriplegia or that are ventilator dependent. If David were to prevail in this matter, \nindividuals with various medical conditions (not only those with quadriplegia or that are ventilator dependent) would \nlikely access additional services. \nPage 7 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 62-4      Filed 05/29/2007     Page 10 of 39\n \n, \n'''~,W,''W''.w\"w_,,,w'W,'''ww.~...,,wm.''''''''...'''W.,,.w.w...w.\",'m.''''''''''W.'\".W.WM.''W.'.'''W,mmM'''.,,,,...W.W.W.w.W.'.WN'.W  \"~..W'.\"W.~.w.W.M'''''''''W,-,W.'..''''w..'.'.,,~.,,,..W.W...,.,. \nGrooms v.

We worked with HFS personnel to identify Medicaid-eligible \nindividuals under age 60 in nursing facilities. There were approximately 9,000 individuals meeting \nthese criteria. We then identified individuals that were not scheduled to be discharged \nfrom the nursing facility in the next 90 days.  From this group of individuals, we then identified how \n9 \nmany individuals had expressed a desire to leave the nursing facility!O and had a \nsupport person \"positive towards\" their discharge from the nursing facility.!! 216 individuals met\nall these criteria. Therefore, these individuals would potentially move from the nursing \nfacility to the community and be served under the Persons with Disabilities Waiver were the\nSCM limitations removed. \n6 HFS has access to data from assessments of nursing facility residents. This data is commonly referred to as Minimum \nData Set (MDS) information. Resident assessments are completed periodically over the course of a year. The database \nused for our analysis included MDS information for residents in nursing facilities on September 30, 2006. The MDS \ninformation was based on the most recently completed assessment as of September 30, 2006. For certain residents who \nhad recently been admitted to a nursing facility (or for those in a hospital or otherwise temporarily out of the nursing \nfacility), there was a two week\" grace period\" to complete MDS assessments. \n9 The MDS assessment instrument includes question Qlc, which indicates whether or not the resident is expected to be discharged \nwithin 90 days. \n10 The MDS assessment instrument includes question Qla, which asks whether the resident desires to return to the \ncommunity. \n11 The MDS assessment instrument includes question Qlb, which indicates whether or not there is a person who is \"positive towards\" \nthe resident's discharge from the nursing facility. \nPage 9 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 62-4      Filed 05/29/2007     Page 12 of 39\n \n\",~,''',~.w.\".~...w.\"\".\"w.\".\"w'''~''''''''''''''''''',.wmWN.'.'.'.',W,\"\"'.'.w.'m.\"\"\"wm.\"w.WWW.''''',,,,,,,.,..W.''w.'.,'.''.,w.',\"'''w..W''.W''''''..\"..,.\",,,,,,........................................................wm.w.'.'',,w.m.,,,w,,\".,.,.\".\",\"''''.''''W.''''\"\nGrooms v.

Assuming \ntthheaste  non-responding individuals would have answered the three questions in a similar manner as \nthose who did respond to all three questions, there would be a total of approximately 1,100 \nMedicaid residents (including the 216 individuals above) under age 60 that were not scheduled to \nbe discharged within the next 90 days, desired to return to the community, and hac:l a person \npositive towards their discharge. Therefore, for purposes of my analysis, I have determined that\napproximately 1,100 current nursing facility residents would potentially move from \nnursing facilities into the  community and be served  under the Persons with  Disabilities Waiver\nwere'the SCM limitations removed. \nWe sorted the MDS data for the  216 individuals described above by their activities of \ndaily living (ADL) scores.12 The ADL scores ranged from 7 to 28. The largest group of \nindividuals had an ADL score of 7. Fr om the 216 MDS assessments, 28 were judgm entally\nselected for detailed clinical review. The sample was selected with the goal of obtaining \nresidents whose ADL scores were distributed in a similar fashion to the ADL scores of the 216 \nidentified residents. \nThe table on the following page details the number of MDS assessments by ADL score\nand the number selected for review. \n12 The ADL score indicates the level of support needed to accomplish activities of daily living, such as eating, bathing, \ngrooming, transfer, etc. Lower scores indicate less need for assistance and higher scores indicate greater need for \nassistance. \nPage 10 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 62-4      Filed 05/29/2007     Page 13 of 39\n \n \n\"W~'~'~\"~~~~'~\"'''''~''''''''''''''''''~''W''-'''''~''-''-'W~'''~~~~~w.wo>m\"~\"\"~\"~\"'\"'M\"\"...w,'-~~,'.w~\",w-\"\"m.w',,~W-~\"-'~\"\"-'-\"WWWW.\"\",,~.~W.w '-\"-W..W-\"~~W'\nGrooms v.

From the plan of care \nand the Medicaid fee schedule, we were able to estimate the cost to care for each individual in the\ncommunity. \nExhibit 1 shows the Medicaid rate paid for each of the 28 individuals to the nursing facility \nas of Fall 2006 and the current rate (effective January 1, 2007), the estimated cost to care \nfor the individual in the community, and the difference between the nursing facility rates and the \nestimated cost to care for the individual in the community. The average difference between \nthe nursing facility rate as of Fall 2006 and the es timated cost to care for the  individual in the\ncommunity is $79.94 per day. The difference using the January 2007 nursing facility rates is \n$83.01 per day. \nAssuming thatthe 28 asse ssments are representative of the 216  assessments, the \nadditional cost for all 216 assessments would be approximately $17,000 per day or \napproximately $6.3 million annually ($79.94 per day x 216 individuals x  365 days) using the Fall \n2006 nursing facility rates. A similar calculation based on the January 2007 rates results in an \nadditional cost of approximately $6.5 million annually. \nAn extrapolation to account for the non-response issue discussed above, results in an \nadditional annual cost for the approximately 1,100 individuals (including the 216 individuals \nabove) of approximately $32 million using the Fall 2006 rates or approxim ately $33 million\nusing the January 2007 rates. \nsupervisor for the DRS Brain Injur y waiver.

The monthly cost information was provided in \n$100 increments. We have been asked to determine the difference between the cost of the \nPersons with Disabilities Waiver recipients' service plans and their respective SCMs. We were also \nasked to perform similar calculations assuming each SCM were increased by 10% and 20%. \nFinally, we were asked to calculate the cost that would be incurred if e ach service plan were \nincreased by 196%14, which represents the difference between the cos~ of services that David \nrequested and the cost of the service plan developed for David for the Persons with Disabilities Waiver. \nThe results (see Exhibit 2 for calculations) of these analyses indicate: \n. \nThe difference between the cost of the Persons with Disabilities Waiver \nrecipients' service plans and their resp ective SCMs would be approxim ately $206\n. million annually. \nThe difference between the cost of the Persons with Disabilities Waiver \nrecipients' service plans and their respective SCMs increased by 10% would be \napproximately $258 million annually. \n14 The cost model is set up so that similar calculations can easily be done for varying percentages. \nPage 13 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 62-4      Filed 05/29/2007     Page 16 of 39\n \n\".\"''''''''''.,\".m,w.\"..ww.\",,,,,,,,\"woW.'.'W..w.'.,,W.''''W.''W.'WW.W...''''',\"''''''''WoW.W.''.w.'..'''..'''''W.''''\"'''W.,''w.w.'W\",w.'\"'..'W.'.'.'..'oW.'.'..'.\"'W.'.\"\"WA.\"\"\",\".'.\"W.\"\"'''W.'''.\"''''''W.W.'''W.'.. \nGrooms v.

MARAM, Director, ) Judge Rebecca R. Pallmeyer\nIllinois Department of Healthcare and )\nFamily Services, )\n)\nDefendant. )\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\nMedicaid funding was once available only to pay for an individual to receive care in an\ninstitution.  Today, states may “waive” the need for individuals to receive services in an institution\nand, instead, provide funding for home or community-based medical care for Medicaid-eligible\nindividuals.  Federal matching funds are available for home or community-based care, however,\nonly if the services provided cost no more than it would cost to care for the individual in an\ninstitutional setting.  Subject to this and other prerequisites for federal approval, each state may\ndefine the terms of its waiver programs.  In this case, the parties debate whether an existing Illinois\nwaiver entitles a severely disabled adult—who requires a hospital-level of care to survive–Medicaid\nbenefits enabling him to receive this care at home.\nPlaintiff David Grooms suffers from Type II Glycogen Storage Disease (“GSD Type II”), a\ngenetic disorder which progressively affects skeletal muscle and muscles involved in respiration.\nHe retains his cognitive ability but is quadriplegic and suffers from a variety of other, related\nailments.  Until he reached age twenty-one, the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family\nServices (“HFS”) paid for Grooms to receive care in his home through the Illinois Medicaid program.\nAs described in more detail below, Grooms’s home care was funded by the Medically Fragile\nTechnology Dependent Children’s (“MFTDC”) waiver.  The MFTDC program pays for a participant’s\nhome care so long as the cost of home care does not exceed the cost of care in a hospital or skilled\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-02211 Document #: 191  Filed: 05/30/08 Page 2 of 35 PageID #:2575\npediatric nursing facility.  On his twenty-first birthday, however, Grooms “aged out” of that program\nand is now eligible for Medicaid-funded home care under the Persons with Disabilities Medicaid\nwaiver (“PWD”).  The State of Illinois has opted to provide home or community-based care for\ndisabled adults only if the cost of such care does not exceed the cost of care in a nursing facility.\nUnder Illinois law, Grooms is therefore now eligible only for home care at a nursing-facility level of\ncare and can receive hospital-level of care only in an institution.\nSeveral key facts are undisputed.  First, Grooms is Medicaid-eligible.  Second, Defendant\nhas not challenged Plaintiff’s evidence that a nursing facility level of care is inadequate to Grooms’s\nneeds, and that only a hospital level of care–including many hours per day of nursing care—is\nappropriate for him.  Third, although neither side has acknowledged it explicitly, both parties appear\nto recognize that, were Grooms to receive care in an institution rather than at home, Medicaid\nwould pay for the care he needs.  Fourth, the PWD waiver provides for home or community-based\ncare only up to a nursing facility level of care, which is less than a hospital-level of care.  In this\nlawsuit against Defendant Barry S. Maram, the Director of HFS, Grooms contends that by choosing\nto cap the benefits it will provide for Grooms’s home care at the cost of nursing home care, HFS\nhas violated the “integration mandate” of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132,\nand the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a), see 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(d) and 41.51(d).  The case\nwas set for a bench trial in October 2007.  After opening statements, however, it became clear that\nthe only disputed issue is the applicability of the integration mandate in this case—a pure question\nof law—so the court ordered summary judgment briefing on the issue.  Having now reviewed the\nbriefs on HFS’s motion for summary judgment, the court concludes HFS is not entitled to judgment\nin its favor, as explained below. \n2\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-02211 Document #: 191  Filed: 05/30/08 Page 3 of 35 PageID #:2576\nBACKGROUND\nI. Illinois Medicaid\nHFS operates Illinois’s Medicaid program under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42\nU.S.C. § 1396.  Under the Title XIX health care assistance program, the federal government\nprovides funding for Medicaid programs administered and partly funded by the states pursuant to\nstate-established guidelines for low-income individuals and families.  Specifically, the Medicaid\nprogram provides federal funds to enable states to “furnish (1) medical assistance on behalf of\nfamilies with dependent children and of aged, blind, or disabled individuals, whose income and\nresources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services, and (2) rehabilitation\nand other services to help such families and individuals attain or retain capability for independence\nor self-care.”  42 U.S.C. § 1396.  The state may elect to provide certain services in its Medicaid\nprogram, including private-duty nursing services, which may be available at the recipient’s home,\nat a hospital, or at a skilled nursing facility.  See Radaszewski ex rel Radaszewski v. Maram, 383\nF.3d 599, 601 (7th Cir. 2004).  For a proposed program to qualify for federal funds, the United\nStates Secretary of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) must approve it.  Id.; 42 U.S.C. § 1396a.\nOnce a state’s plan is approved, the federal government agrees to pay (among other obligations)\nan amount equal to the statutorily-defined “Federal medical assistance percentage” of the state’s\nquarterly medical assistance expenditures.  42 U.S.C. § 1396b(a)(1).\nA state with an approved Medicaid plan may also apply to the Secretary of HHS for a\n“waiver,” which allows the state to include as “medical assistance” payments for “home or\ncommunity-based services” (as opposed to institutional services) that the Secretary has approved\nand that are provided pursuant to a written plan of care.  42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(1).  In order for the\nstate to qualify for such a waiver, the home or community based services it provides must be\navailable to “individuals with respect to whom there has been a determination that but for the\nprovision of such services the individuals would require the level of care provided in a hospital or\n3\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-02211 Document #: 191  Filed: 05/30/08 Page 4 of 35 PageID #:2577\na nursing facility . . . the cost of which could be reimbursed under the State plan.”  Id.  In other\nwords, an individual is eligible for services under the a waiver only if, absent home or community-\nbased care, he or she would be entitled to Medicaid benefits enabling him or her to receive care\nin an institution.  In addition, the state must provide the Secretary satisfactory assurances that,\namong other things, the waiver is cost-neutral: the average per capita expenditure estimated by the\nState for medical assistance may not exceed the average estimated per capita expenditure that\nwould have been required absent the waiver.  42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(2)(D).  The parties agree that\nthe Secretary of HHS has approved for Illinois two waivers relevant to this action: the MFTDC\nwaiver and the PWD waiver.  (Am. Ans. ¶ 17.)  Waivers providing home or community-based care\nfor qualified adults constitute Illinois’s Home Services Program (“HSP”).  Often, provision of care\nat home is less expensive than institutional care.  Thus, according to one court, the HSP has\nproven “very cost-effective.”  Radaszewski ex rel. Radaszewski v. Maram, No. 01 C 9551, 2008 WL\n2097382, at *7 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 26, 2008).  In 2005, HFS reported a savings of $13,676 per participant\n(with 19,827 participants): community care cost per participant cost $19,140 per year, while cost\nto care for each participant in an institution was $32,816 per year.  Id.\nGrooms has taken advantage of the waiver programs available to him both as a child and\nas an adult.  First, until his twenty-first birthday, Grooms participated in the MFTDC waiver program.\nPursuant to the MFTDC program, the State has adopted regulations requiring HFS to “administer\na home and community-based service (HCBS) waiver program . . . for disabled persons under the\nage of 21 years who are medically fragile and technology dependent.”  89 Ill. Adm. Code §\n120.530(a); see also http://www.hfs.illinois.gov/hcbswaivers/tdmfc.html.  By its terms, this waiver\nprogram applies to individuals who would otherwise require a level of care provided by a hospital\nor a facility certified by the State to provide long-term care for persons under twenty-two years of\nage.  89 Ill. Adm. Code § 120.530(b).  Eligible ventilator-dependent individuals, such as Grooms,\n4\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-02211 Document #: 191  Filed: 05/30/08 Page 5 of 35 PageID #:2578\nare entitled to reimbursement for home care so long as the cost of such care does not exceed the\ncost of hospital-level care.  89 Ill. Adm. Code § 120.530(e)(3)(A). \nNow that he is an adult, Grooms receives home care as a participant in the PWD waiver.\nThat waiver, for which disabled individuals under the age of sixty may qualify, differs from the\nMFTDC waiver in several ways.1  The PWD waiver enables HFS to fund home or community-based\ncare at a nursing facility-level of care for eligible adults with physical disabilities who would\notherwise be forced to live in a nursing facility.  See 89 Ill. Adm. Code §§ 676.10(a), 676.30(j),\n676.40, & 682.100; http://www.hfs.illinois.gov/hcbswaivers/disabilities.html.  In contrast to the\nMFTDC waiver, which is administered by the University of Illinois Division of Specialized Care for\nChildren, Illinois’s Department of Human Services bears direct operational responsibility for the\nPWD waiver.  89 Ill. Adm. Cod § 676.10(b).  The State’s PWD waiver uses a Service Cost\nMaximum (“SCM”) to limit the benefits available to participants; the individual’s SCM directly\ncorresponds to the cost the State would bear for providing nursing care for the individual in an\ninstitutional setting.  89 Ill. Adm. Code § 679.50; Radaszewski, 383 F.3d at 602.  In other words,\nthe SCM functions as a cap: the cost of care for a disabled adult in a nursing facility is the maximum\nbenefit that individual can expect to receive for his or her home care.  To calculate the SCM for\nindividuals who are eligible for care in an institution but choose to receive home or community-\nbased care, Illinois uses a Determination of Need (“DON”) test, which measures what is referred\nto as an individual’s “imminent risk of institutionalization.”  89 Ill. Adm. Code §§ 679.10(b),\n676.30(d).  Thus, the DON test assesses an individual’s physical eligibility for the Home Services\nProgram, including the extent of his or her impairment and need for external care.  89 Ill. Adm.\n1 Federal law also treats individuals under the age of twenty-one differently than\nadults: the early periodic screening, diagnosis, and treatment services (“EPSDT”) program is\nmandatory and requires states to provide any service listed in 42 U.S.C. § 1396(a) that is “medically\nnecessary”  to  the  individual  under  twenty-one  years  old.    States  must  provide  those\nservices–including private-duty nursing–whether or not they are available to the rest of the\npopulation.\n5\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-02211 Document #: 191  Filed: 05/30/08 Page 6 of 35 PageID #:2579\nCode § 679.10.  The DON assessment determines an individual’s eligibility for placement in a\nhospital or nursing facility and/or for home services.  Id.  An individual’s DON score is then found\nto correspond to an SCM.  See 89 Ill. Admin. Code § 679.50(b) (setting forth SCMs for participants\nin HSP).  \nGrooms argues that the DON calculus is irrelevant to his claims, because–based on his\ndependence on a ventilator–he received an “exceptional care” rate in October 2005.   (Def.’s 56.1\n¶ 52.)  Indeed, Illinois regulations recognize that no SCM is sufficient to serve individuals who\nrequire what the state refers to as “exceptional medical care,” so HFS sets an “exceptional care\nrate” for those individuals.  89 Ill. Adm. Code §§ 140.569(a), 679.50(f); Radaszewski, 383 F.3d at\n603.  Ventilator-dependent individuals receive exceptional care rates.  The Illinois Medical\nAssistance Statute, which establishes a program for providing various types of medical assistance\nincluding Medicaid, defines exceptional medical care as “the level of medical care required by\npersons who are medically stable for discharge from a hospital but who require acute intensity\nhospital level care for physician, nurse and ancillary specialist services. . . .”  305 ILCS 5/5-1.1(i).\nOnly skilled nursing facilities that meet certain state requirements—or exceptional care nursing\nfacilities—may receive payments for providing exceptional care.   305 ILCS 5/5-5.8a(a).  The\nexceptional care rate approximates the cost of providing exceptional medical care to an individual\nin an institution, and is calculated by identifying the daily exceptional care rate for the nearest\napproved exceptional care nursing facility to the individual’s home and extrapolating a monthly\nexceptional care rate.  89 Ill. Adm. Code § 679.50(f); Radaszewski, 383 F.3d at 603 n.2.\nNevertheless, as described below, even the exceptional care rate to which Grooms is entitled does\nnot provide him with sufficient funding for the care he needs to remain in his home.  \n6\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-02211 Document #: 191  Filed: 05/30/08 Page 7 of 35 PageID #:2580\nII. Grooms’s PWD Waiver Benefits\nDefendant admits that Grooms is disabled.  (10/31/07 Trial Tr. 22:4-5, Ex. D to Pl.’s Resp.)\nGrooms was diagnosed with GSD Type II when he was twelve years old.  (Compl. ¶ 1; 10/31/07\nTrial Tr. 7:1-6.)   This is a muscle disease, which progressively affects both skeletal muscle and the\nmuscles involved in respiration.  (Compl. ¶ 1.)  Grooms’s condition has also caused him to suffer\nfrom a variety of medical ailments, including cardiomyopathy, scoliosis, asthma, and osteoporosis.\n(10/31/07 Trial Tr. 7:1-6.)  He is wholly dependent on a ventilator for his breathing.  (Id.)  In addition,\nGrooms is a quadriplegic who must rely on others for virtually all care and mobility.  (Compl. ¶¶ 1-2.)\nGrooms has some use of his hands, and is able to drink from a straw, feed himself certain foods,\nand use a computer.  (Id. ¶ 2.)  Aside from this, he retains virtually no body functions.  (Id.)  His\ncognitive function, on the other hand, is unimpaired.  (Id.)\nNor are the particulars of the Medicaid benefits Grooms has received disputed in this action.\nThe parties agree that Grooms is eligible to receive Medicaid assistance (Def.’s 56.1 ¶ 1), and do\nnot dispute that Medicaid provides funding for necessary institutional care including, if necessary,\nhospitalization.  Grooms received skilled nursing care at home pursuant to the MFTDC program\nuntil his twenty-first birthday.  (Compl. ¶ 26.)  Grooms notes that during 2005, HFS paid\napproximately $16,000 for monthly medical services provided by a Registered Nurse and a\nLicensed Practical Nurse as well as approximately $1,000 per month for respite care, which is\ntemporary, short-term care of an individual with a disability to provide families with a break from\ncaregiving.  (Id. ¶ 27.)  Defendant’s proffered expert–Todd D. Menenberg–echoed this, expressing\nhis understanding that Grooms received through the MFTDC program nursing services costing\n$16,000 per month and respite care costing $1,000 per month.  (Grooms v. Maram Expert Witness\nReport dated 3/19/07 (“Menenberg Rept.”), Ex. D to Pl.’s 56.1.)  Grooms also contends that his\nreimbursed medical expenses in the year before his twenty-first birthday totaled approximately\n7\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-02211 Document #: 191  Filed: 05/30/08 Page 8 of 35 PageID #:2581\n$221,760.  (Compl. ¶ 27.)  Grooms’s parents were responsible for the rest of his medical care,\nthough the record does not reveal what this remaining medical care included.  (Id.) \nOn January 21, 2005, Grooms; his mother; his nurse; his case manager from the University\nof Illinois Division of Specialized Care for Children, which administers the MFTDC program; and\nSusan Whitney (a counselor from the Department of Human Services’ Division of Rehabilitation\nServices, which administers PWD waivers) met to discuss the Home Services Program and the\nservices that would be available for Grooms once he aged out of the MFTDC program.  (Def.’s 56.1\n¶ 47.)  Generally, when an individual is approved to receive services at home, a “Service Plan” is\ndeveloped for his or her Medicaid assistance.  Whitney completed an Interim Service Plan which\nafforded Grooms total monthly service benefits of $150 for twenty hours per month of Personal\nAssistant (“PA”) services.  (Id. ¶ 48.)  Then, on September 24, 2005, an Addendum Service Plan\nwas developed for Grooms (presumably by Whitney in connection with Grooms’s medical advisors);\nit provided 406.25 hours of LPN services for a total of $8,125 per month and fifty hours of PA\nservices for a total of $392.50 per month.  (Id. ¶ 51; Home Services Program Service Plan for David\nW. Grooms dated 9/24/05, DX 56.)  This resulted in a total monthly payment of $8,517.50 for\nGrooms’s home care.  (Id.)  On October 11, 2005–days after Grooms’s twenty-first birthday–a\n“Second Addendum Home Services Program Service Plan” was developed for Grooms, providing\n318 hours of Registered Nurse services for a total of $7,314 per month; 51.5 hours of Licensed\nPractical Nurse services for a total of $1,030 per month; and 36 hours of PA services for a total of\n$282.60 per month (Def.’s 56.1 ¶ 53; Home Services Program Service Plan for David W. Grooms\ndated 10/11/05, DX 57.)  In sum, Grooms was deemed entitled to Medicaid assistance totaling\n$8,626.60 per month for nursing and personal assistance services.  (Id.)  In that same month, HFS\ncalculated an“exceptional care rate” for Grooms, because he is a ventilator-assisted individual; that\nrate was an amount not to exceed $8,633.20.  (Def.’s 56.1 ¶ 52; Home Services Program\nExceptional Care Rate for Ventilator Assisted Individuals for David Grooms dated 10/05, DX 47.)\n8\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-02211 Document #: 191  Filed: 05/30/08 Page 9 of 35 PageID #:2582\nIt is not apparent from the record whether this sum is in addition to or in place of the SCM\ncalculated  for  Grooms.    Then,  on  January  24,  2006,  Whitney  developed  a  Service  Plan\nReassessment for Grooms, which again afforded Grooms services identical to those provided by\nthe October 2005 Service Plan.  (Def.’s 56.1 ¶¶ 56-7.)  It is undisputed that the benefits Grooms\nreceives under the PWD waiver amount to less than half of what he received for home care under\nthe MFTDC waiver program.\nDespite this reduction in benefits, since his twenty-first birthday on October 8, 2005, Grooms\nhas remained at his parents’ home rather than in an institution.  (Def.’s 56.1 ¶ 60.)  His parents\nhave personally cared for him around the clock, at considerable hardship.  Due to their own\nworsening health and work demands, however, his parents are unable to continue making these\nextraordinary efforts.  (Compl. ¶ 31.)  Thus, Groom alleges, the reduction in funding for his care that\nresults from the limitations in the state’s PWD waiver will force him to enter an institution–a result\nhe believes violates federal law.  (Id. ¶ 36.) .\nIII. Litigation\nGrooms initiated this litigation on April 20, 2006, alleging that HFS’s actions violate the ADA\nand the Rehabilitation Act because his forced institutionalization will unlawfully segregate him from\nthe community.  (Compl.)  Following a period of discovery, a bench trial was scheduled to begin on\nOctober 31, 2007.  (Docket Entry No. 148.)  The parties’ opening statements revealed that there\nare no disputes of fact concerning Groom’s physical condition or his medical needs:\nTHE COURT: . . . .I thought I was going to be hearing evidence about Mr.\nGrooms’ medical condition and why he could be perfectly well accommodated in a\nskilled nursing facility despite what the plaintiff characterizes as these grave needs\nfor ventilator services and the like.\nBut the openings establish to my satisfaction that it’s the defendant’s position\nthat we really don’t look at that issue.  We really -- under the statutes and the\nregulations, we are not discriminating against him.  We are making the care\navailable that the statutes and regulations call for.  And this additional level of care\nis simply not available to the plaintiff under the relevant regulations.\n9\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-02211 Document #: 191  Filed: 05/30/08 Page 10 of 35 PageID #:2583\n. . . .[M]y understanding is the defendant believes even if the plaintiff can\ndemonstrate that his medical needs are such that they cannot be accommodated\nin a skilled nursing facility, he still is not entitled to more money for home-based\ncare.\nMR. HUSTON:  That is correct.  You have to cap it at a nursing facility level\nof care under the persons with disabilities [waiver].\n(10/31/07 Trial Tr. 53:17-54:16.)  Thus, the court declined to hear testimony and, instead, ordered\nadditional summary judgment briefing on the disputed legal issue.\nDefendant moved for summary judgment on November 30, 2007.  (Docket Entry No. 149.)\nDefendant’s position on summary judgment is not that hospital-level care is unnecessary for\nGrooms but, rather, that HFS has no obligation to fund hospital-level care for Grooms under the\nPWD waiver.  Citing Supreme Court and Seventh Circuit cases holding that failure to integrate can\nconstitute discrimination in violation of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, Plaintiff counters that HFS\nis indeed obliged to provide adequate funding for Grooms’s home care so long as home care is\nappropriate, acceptable to Grooms and his family, and cost-neutral.  Plaintiff did not move for\nsummary judgment but, on March 6, 2008, requested a preliminary injunction requiring the state\nto provide funding for Grooms to receive a hospital-level of care in his home.  (Docket Entry No.\n181.)  As explained below, the court concludes that Defendant is not entitled to judgment as a\nmatter of law at this stage and, because Plaintiff is likely to succeed on the merits of his claims,\ndirects the parties to appear in court to assess what preliminary relief should be afforded to\nGrooms. \nDISCUSSION\nI. Summary Judgment Legal Standard\nSummary judgment is proper when the court, having reviewed the pleadings, depositions,\ntranscripts, discovery responses, exhibits, and affidavits, finds that there is no genuine issue of\nmaterial fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.  FED. R. CIV. P.\n56(c); see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986).  In determining whether a\n10\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-02211 Document #: 191  Filed: 05/30/08 Page 11 of 35 PageID #:2584\ngenuine issue of material fact exists, the court must view the evidence and draw all reasonable\ninferences in favor of the party opposing the motion.  Bennington v. Caterpillar Inc., 275 F.3d 654,\n658 (7th Cir. 2001); see Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986).  At this stage,\nGrooms must produce enough evidence to support a reasonable jury verdict in his favor, while\nMaram, as the moving party, bears the burden of proving that there is no genuine issue of material\nfact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Hicks v. Midwest Transit, Inc., 500 F.3d\n647, 651 (7th Cir. 2007).\nII. Grooms’s Claims\nTitle II of the ADA provides that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of\nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,\nprograms, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.”\n42 U.S.C. § 12132.  The Rehabilitation Act provides that “[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a\ndisability in the United States . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from\nthe participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program\nor activity receiving Federal financial assistance . . . .”  29 U.S.C. § 794(a).  Due to the similarities\nbetween the relevant provisions of the statutes, the court’s analysis will focus on Grooms’s ADA\nclaim but apply with equal force to the Rehabilitation Act claim.  Radaszewski, 383 F.3d at 607.\nCertain basic elements of this ADA claim are undisputed here.  First, Grooms is an individual with\na disability (though the parties dispute whether he is “qualified” for the PWD waiver).  (10/31/07\nTrial Tr. 22:4-5.)  In addition, HFS is a public entity within the meaning of Title II of the ADA and an\nentity that receives federal funds for purposes of the Rehabilitation Act.  (Docket Entry No. 125-2\nat Schedule (a)-5.)  Thus, HFS is subject to the integration mandate implicit in each statute.  Having\nagreed on these two elements of Plaintiff’s claims, the parties dispute two key issues: (1) whether\nGrooms is qualified for the PWD waiver (and thus can be considered a qualified individual with a\ndisability); and (2) whether Grooms was subject to discrimination by reason of his disability. \n11\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-02211 Document #: 191  Filed: 05/30/08 Page 12 of 35 PageID #:2585\nA. Grooms is a Qualified Individual with a Disability\nAlthough Defendant now intimates that it has reserved the right to challenge Grooms’s need\nfor hospital-level care (Reply at 4 n.1), there is no factual dispute that Grooms in fact requires\nhospital-level care.  The only expert analysis referred to regarding Grooms’s medical condition\nduring the parties’ opening statements was that of Dr. Mary Keen of the Marianjoy Rehabilitation\nHospital and Clinics.  Plaintiff’s counsel summarized that testimony as follows:\nDr. Keen will testify she is familiar with the level of, particularly the staffing\nlevels of nursing homes in Illinois, and that in her professional opinion, David would\nbe unsafe were he to be placed in a nursing facility and provided the care provided\nto other patients.\nThe evidence will also show that the State has made no effort to determine\nwhether David could in fact be safely served in a nursing facility.  It did not submit\nany of its information to any facility for review or advice regarding whether such\nfacility could or would safely care for him.  It has conducted no reviews of nursing\nfacilities to determine whether they could provide needed care to a person with\nDavid’s level of fragility and complexity.\n(10/31/07 Trial Tr. 15:8-20.)  Defense counsel made clear that they would not present a defense\nmedical expert.  (Id. at 39:12-13.)  Nor did Defendant suggest there had been any sudden\nsignificant improvement in Grooms’s physical condition on his twenty-first birthday.  The court\ntherefore  noted  specifically  that  defense  counsel  was  not  arguing  that  Grooms  could  be\naccommodated in a skilled nursing facility.  (Id. at 40:23-41:3.)  In other words, defense counsel has\neffectively conceded that Grooms needs a higher level of care than that provided in the HSP.\nThe evidence before the court confirms that Grooms cannot continue to live at home, absent\nadditional assistance.  Grooms’s Complaint asserts that his current level of assistance under the\nPWD waiver is insufficient to permit him survive at home, and that his parents will be forced to\ninstitutionalize him to ensure that he continues to receive the care he needs.  (Compl. ¶¶ 31, 36;\nsee also 10/31/07 Trial Tr. 7:23-8:1.)  Since filing the Complaint, Grooms’s situation has worsened.\nPlaintiff’s counsel has advised the court that Plaintiff’s parents, who have been providing care to\nsubstitute for the additional care Grooms once received and still needs, are no longer capable of\n12\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-02211 Document #: 191  Filed: 05/30/08 Page 13 of 35 PageID #:2586\nproviding this assistance and that, even if they could, it would be inadequate to provide for\nGrooms’s safety.  (Docket Entry No. 182 at 10-13.)  Dr. Keen confirmed that the levels of skilled\nnursing care Grooms currently receives are inadequate, putting him at risk of “serious medical\ncrisis.” (Keen Aff. dated 3/5/08 ¶ 10, Ex. C to Mot. for Prelim. Inj.)  As of July 2007, Grooms’s\nventilator was disconnecting once or twice a night; he needed to be turned five times per night due\nto back pain (on bad nights, as many as fifteen to twenty times per night); he required suctioning\napproximately five times per day; and he could not be removed from his ventilator for more than a\nfew seconds at a time.  (Id. ¶¶ 6-7.)  Thus, he needs someone to respond to alarms, adjust his\noxygen levels, monitor his vital signs, and provide additional care.  (Id. ¶ 8.)  The risk of medical\ncrisis without this constant care has already materialized: Grooms developed Methicillin-resistant\nStaphylococcus aureus (“MRSA”), a serious antibiotic-resistant staph infection.  (Id. ¶ 9.)  Dr. Keen\nbelieves that the inadequate nursing care Grooms receives may have precipitated this infection.\n(Id.)\nIn neither the summary judgment nor the preliminary injunction briefing does Defendant\nchallenge the accuracy of this description of Grooms’s medical condition or the inability of his\nparents to provide adequate medical care.  The court therefore accepts as true that Grooms’s\nmedical condition continues to deteriorate, forcing him to be increasingly dependent on consistent\nskilled nursing care.  The court also accepts as true that increased medical care and supervision\nwould improve or stabilize Grooms’s condition by, for example, preventing future staph infections.\nAbsent this increased medical care and supervision, Grooms will be required to move to an\ninstitution. \nThe PWD waiver under which Grooms currently receives benefits is intended for individuals\nwho would require a nursing-facility level of care.  (Def.’s 56.1 ¶ 14.)  Thus, Defendant contends\nthat, if he requires hospital-level care, Grooms is no longer qualified for the PWD waiver.  (Reply\nat 6.)  The Seventh Circuit has considered this argument in a very similar case and rejected it.  In\n13\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-02211 Document #: 191  Filed: 05/30/08 Page 14 of 35 PageID #:2587\nRadaszewski, the State argued that Eric Radaszewski was ineligible for the HSP because the cost\nof providing him continuous care would exceed the cost of exceptional care in a nursing facility,\nwhich is the maximum amount to be paid for at-home care.  Radaszewski, 383 F.3d at 612. The\ncourt expressly disagreed, holding that Eric was a qualified individual with a disability because he\nwas otherwise eligible for the PWD waiver: he had severe, long-term disabilities, he was Medicaid-\neligible, and he was at risk of being placed in an medical institution.  Id.  In addition, home care was\nappropriate and beneficial for Eric.  Id.  There is no dispute that Grooms meets all these criteria.\nFinally, the Radaszewski court held that Eric was qualified for the HSP in that the cost of Eric’s\nhome care would not exceed the anticipated cost of caring for him in an institutional setting.  Id. at\n613.  As discussed below, there is no evidence that for Grooms to receive home care would violate\nthe cost-neutrality standard.  Accordingly, Grooms is a qualified individual with a disability.\nB. Grooms was Subject to Discrimination by Reason of his Disability\n1. Integration Mandate\nEven if he is qualified, Defendant contends, the governing statutes and regulations do not\nrecognize Grooms’s “integration” claim as stating a cause of action for discrimination in violation\nof the ADA.  (Def.’s Mem. at 3-6.)  This argument, too, contradicts the governing Supreme Court\nand Seventh Circuit precedent.\nFor purposes of this action, the ADA and Rehabilitation Act contain substantially similar\nrequirements.  The ADA’s regulatory scheme makes clear that Title II establishes what is known\nas an “integration mandate.”  Specifically, “[a] public entity shall administer services, programs, and\nactivities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with\ndisabilities.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d).  This integration mandate is not unlimited; the regulations also\nprovide that while a public entity is required to “make reasonable modifications in policies, practices,\nor procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of\ndisability,” there is an exception if “the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications\n14\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-02211 Document #: 191  Filed: 05/30/08 Page 15 of 35 PageID #:2588\nwould fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7).\nThe Rehabilitation Act contains similar requirements.  That statute’s regulations provide that\nprograms shall be administered “in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified\nhandicapped persons.”  28 C.F.R. § 41.51(d).  In light of their similarity, courts “construe and apply”\nthese provisions of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act “in a consistent manner.”  Radaszewski, 383\nF.3d at 607. \nOlmstead v. L. C. by Zimring, 527 U.S. 581 (1999) explains what is meant by the integration\nmandate.  “Unjustified isolation” of a disabled individual constitutes discrimination based on\ndisability.  See id. at 597.   In applicable statutory findings, “Congress explicitly identified unjustified\n‘segregation’ of persons with disabilities as a ‘form of discrimination.’” Id. at 600 (quoting 42 U.S.C.\n§§ 12101(a)(2) & 12101(a)(5)).  In Olmstead, the State of Georgia argued that it had not\ndiscriminated against disabled individuals by housing them in institutions and denying them\ncommunity placement for two reasons: first, this denial of community-based treatment was not on\naccount of their disabilities and, second, those individuals had not identified uneven treatment of\nsimilarly-situated individuals.  Id. at 598.  The Supreme Court rejected each argument, concluding\nthat Congress “had a more comprehensive view of the concept of discrimination advanced in the\nADA.”    Id.    The  Court  explained  that  the  integration  mandate  reflects  two  judgments:  (1)\ninstitutionalizing persons capable of thriving in community settings “perpetuates unwarranted\nassumptions that persons so isolated are incapable or unworthy of participating in community life;”\nand (2) institutionalization interferes with individuals’ everyday life activities, such as “family\nrelations, social contacts, work options, economic independence, educational advancement, and\ncultural enrichment.”  Id. at 600-601.  The court cautioned, however, that individuals not able to\nhandle or benefit from community settings ought not be forcibly removed from institutional settings.\nId. at 601-602.  Olmstead thus established the following rule:\n15\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-02211 Document #: 191  Filed: 05/30/08 Page 16 of 35 PageID #:2589\nStates are required to provide community-based treatment for persons with mental\ndisabilities when the State’s treatment professionals determine that such placement\nis appropriate, the affected persons do not oppose such treatment, and the\nplacement can be reasonably accommodated, taking into account the resources\navailable to the State and the needs of others with mental disabilities.\nId. at 607.2\nAccording to Defendant Maram, Olmstead does not establish a private right of action to\nenforce the integration mandate.  The court finds no support for this interpretation in Olmstead\nitself, which expressly deems “unjustified institutional isolation” of disabled individuals to be\nactionable discrimination, under the delineated circumstances.  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 600.\nDefendant next seeks to distinguish Olmstead because that ruling did not require the State of\nGeorgia to modify its Medicaid waiver but, rather, directed that the plaintiffs be placed into existing\ncommunity-based institutions.  Again, the court disagrees.  In Olmstead, Georgia argued to the\ndistrict court that requiring the state to immediately transfer the plaintiffs between institutions would\nfundamentally alter the state’s Medicaid program, because Georgia was already using all its\navailable funds to provide services to other persons with disabilities.  Id. at 594.  Thus, the\nOlmstead court would effectively require the state to modify its distribution of services if the district\ncourt determined that Georgia’s current scheme violated the integration mandate.  Regardless of\nwhether Defendant’s characterization is accurate, however, it is irrelevant unless requiring Illinois\n2 Defendant challenges the regulations’ validity.  (Def.’s Mem. at 4.)  Because the\nparties in Olmstead addressed only the proper construction and enforcement of the regulations, the\ncourt did not reach the issue of their validity.  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 592-93.  This court also\ndeclines to address the matter, as the regulations are not the only source for the integration\nmandate Olmstead recognized.  The Olmstead court also identified legislative history and findings\nsuggesting that the ADA by its own terms was intended to offer the benefits of community living to\nindividuals with disabilities.  Id. at 599-600.  In addition, it considered the position of the Department\nof Justice, as the agency that issued regulations implementing Title II of the ADA.  Olmstead, 527\nU.S. at 597-98.  The Department of Justice “consistently advocated” that undue institutionalization\nconstitutes discrimination by reason of disability.  Id. at 597.  Finally, neither party has engaged in\nany comprehensive analysis of the regulations’ validity, rendering it inappropriate for consideration\nat this stage.\n16\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-02211 Document #: 191  Filed: 05/30/08 Page 17 of 35 PageID #:2590\nto modify its Medicaid waiver is an unreasonable accommodation, which the court will consider\nbelow. \nDefendant’s  position  is  also  inconsistent  with  Seventh  Circuit  authority.    In  a  case\nsubstantially similar to Olmstead (though it involved an individual who, like Grooms, had a physical\nrather than a mental disability), the Seventh Circuit entertained an individual’s claim for enforcement\nof the integration mandate.  See Radaszewski, 383 F.3d 599.  Eric Radaszewski was a “medically\nfragile” adult requiring around-the-clock, one-on-one care by a registered nurse in order to survive.\nId. at 600-01.  As of September 1, 2001, Illinois ceased to provide “private-duty nursing,” or nursing\nservices for an adult who requires care that is more individualized and continuous than that\nprovided by a visiting nurse, a hospital nursing staff, or a skilled nursing facility’s staff.  Id. at 601.\nThus, like Plaintiff Grooms, when Eric turned twenty-one and aged out of the MFTDC program, he\nlost entitlement to around-the-clock private-duty nursing.  Id. at 602-03.  The Illinois Department of\nPublic Aid (“IDPA”)–now HFS–determined that Eric was entitled to exceptional care, but contended\nthat it was not authorized to pay for at-home medical care beyond what it would cost to provide Eric\nwith exceptional care in a skilled nursing facility.  Id. at 603.  According to the IDPA, if Eric required\ntreatment not covered by his existing Medicaid HSP, he would need to move to an institutional\nsetting to receive the additional treatment within the Medicaid program.  Id.  The IDPA also\ndetermined that Eric could be adequately cared for in a nursing home facility.  Id.  Eric’s mother filed\na complaint on Eric’s behalf, challenging the reduction in the level of Eric’s private-duty nursing\nservices.  Id.  The district court entered judgment on the pleadings for the State, holding, first, that\nplaintiffs had named the wrong defendant for its ADA claim by naming an individual rather than the\npublic entity.  Radaszewski ex rel. Radaszewski v. Garner, No. 01 C 9551, 2002 WL 31045384, at\n*2 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 11, 2002).  With regard to plaintiff’s Rehabilitation Act claim, the district court\nfound that the lack of in-home nursing care available for Eric applied equally to handicapped and\nnon-handicapped individuals and was thus lawful.  Id. at *3. \n17\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-02211 Document #: 191  Filed: 05/30/08 Page 18 of 35 PageID #:2591\nThe Seventh Circuit reversed.  Radaszewski, 383 F.3d at 615.  In remanding the case to\nthe district court, the Court of Appeals applied the Olmstead test, holding that the integration\nmandate requires the State of Illinois “to provide community-based treatment for individuals with\ndisabilities, so long as the State’s treatment professionals find that such treatment is appropriate,\nthe  affected  individuals  do  not  oppose  community-based  treatment,  and  placement  in  the\ncommunity can be reasonably accommodated, taking into account the State’s resources and the\nneeds of others with similar disabilities.”  Id. at 608.  In Radaszewski, it was clear that Eric could\nbe cared for at home and that neither he nor his family opposed the prospect of him receiving care\nat home.  Id.  The same is true here: the parties apparently agree that Grooms can receive\ntreatment at home and, in fact, did so until his twenty-first birthday with Medicaid assistance;\nsimilarly, his parents’ continued care for Grooms after he aged out of the MFTDC program makes\nclear that no affected individuals oppose such a treatment plan for Grooms.  Thus, the only\ndisputed issue here, as in Radaszewski, is whether the State can reasonably accommodate home\ntreatment, taking into account the State’s resources and the needs of others with similar disabilities.\nWhen addressing the reasonable accommodation prong, the Radaszewski court focused on the\ncost to Illinois of funding home care for Eric.\nThere, the State argued that compelling an increase to the exceptional care rate for\nindividuals as severely disabled as Eric Radaszewski was not reasonable.  Radaszewski, 383 F.3d\nat 609.  The Seventh Circuit did not answer this question, as the factual record remained\nundeveloped.  Instead, the court provided a roadmap for assessing the reasonableness of requiring\nthe State to accommodate a request for home treatment.  First, the court sought to identify the\nproper benchmark for assessing the financial cost of providing Eric home care.  Ultimately,\nreasonableness would depend on two issues: whether a nursing home facility could meet Eric’s\nneeds and what level of care Eric would require in an institutional facility.  Id. at 610.  If a disabled\nindividual cannot receive adequate care in a nursing facility, the “type and cost” of medical care\n18\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-02211 Document #: 191  Filed: 05/30/08 Page 19 of 35 PageID #:2592\nprovided in a nursing facility is not a proper reference point for assessing whether services the\nindividual seeks to receive at home would be provided in an institutional setting.  Id.  The inquiry\nregarding what level of care a disabled individual would require in an institutional facility is likewise\ncritical because, if Eric would require “constant monitoring and continuous skilled assistance” in an\ninstitutional setting, the State would be required to provide Eric with those services in an institution.\nId. at 611.  If the services Eric would require in an institution were equivalent to around-the-clock,\nprivate-duty nursing care, then Eric might have a claim to receive private-duty nursing care at home,\ndespite the fact that Illinois Medicaid does not ordinarily provide such a service.  Id.\nThe Radaszewski court made clear, however, that the State would not be required to\nprovide Eric with equivalent home care if doing so would place an unreasonable burden on the\nState or would force the state to fundamentally alter the nature of its programs.  Radaszewski, 383\nF.3d at 611.  The State of Illinois has limited resources to allocate to disabled individuals, and,\nwithin  certain  parameters,  the  State  is  entitled  to  make  these  allocations.    Although  the\nRadaszewski complaint alleged that the cost of Eric’s continued care at home did not exceed the\ncontinued cost of caring for him in an institution, id. at 613, this did not end the court’s inquiry.\nCourts must also consider the overall costs borne by the state.  For example, that Eric is cared for\nat home does not enable the state to close or reduce the size of a costly institution in which he\nmight otherwise receive care.  Id. at 614.  The Seventh Circuit directed the district court, on remand,\nto evaluate the cost of Eric’s care in the context of the overall costs of the Illinois Medicaid program,\nincluding the cost of maintaining existing institutions that provide care.   Id. at 614-15. \nAs the court understands the teaching of Olmstead and Radaszewski, Grooms has a private\nright of action to contest a violation of the “integration mandate.”  Several district courts have\nreached the same conclusion.  Radaszewski, 2008 WL 2097382, at *14 (on remand, entering\njudgment for plaintiff on ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims: “Defendant argues that neither the ADA\nnor [Rehabilitation Act] provide[s] for an independent claim for integration in the community and that\n19\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-02211 Document #: 191  Filed: 05/30/08 Page 20 of 35 PageID #:2593\nthe authorities cited by Plaintiff do not recognize an independent claim for integration.  Defendant’s\narguments are meritless and directly contrary to Olmstead and Radaszewski.”); Fisher v. Maram,\nNo. 06 C 4405, 2006 WL 2505833, at *4 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 28, 2006) (granting temporary restraining\norder: “As this court reads the Radaszewski opinion, it appears that the Court concluded that if the\nlevel of care which would have to be given in an institution in order for Eric to survive amounts to\nthe equivalent of around-the-clock, private-duty nursing care, then Eric may well have a viable claim\nto receive private-duty nursing care at home because then, private-duty nursing care would present\na reasonable alternative that would not require a fundamental alteration of the State’s programs and\nservices”);3 Opinion and Order, Sidell v. Maram, No. 05-1001 (C.D. Ill. May 14, 2007) (denying\ndefendant’s motion for summary judgment on integration mandate claims because PWD waiver\nproviding home or community-based care in place of nursing-home level care is not co-extensive\nwith providing waiver in place of all “institutional” care).4  The court therefore concludes that Grooms\nmay bring a claim for violation of the integration mandate if he satisfies the three factors set forth\nin Olmstead and Radaszewski.\n3 Most recently, Judge Guzman denied cross-motions for summary judgment in\nFisher v. Maram, finding that there remained contested issues of fact appropriate for resolution at\ntrial.  Minute Order, Fisher v. Maram, 06 C 4405 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 20, 2008).  In that Order, Judge\nGuzman reaffirmed that the integration mandate supports a cause of action under the ADA and\nRehabilitation Act: “[D]efendant argues that there is no independent private right of action regarding\nthe ADA and Rehabilitation Act’s integration regulations.  This argument misses the point.  Plaintiff’s\nADA and Rehabilitation Act claims are based on defendant’s alleged discrimination based on her\ndisability.”  Id. at 3-4.  In Fisher, there was a triable issue of fact as to whether a nursing home could\nprovide appropriate medical treatment for the disabled individual.  Id. at 4.  Judge Guzman also\nfound a triable issue of fact as to Defendant’s affirmative defenses that providing the disabled\nindividual with the requested relief would impose undue hardship on the State of Illinois, in light of\nconflicting expert opinion.  Id.  Judge Guzman has scheduled a jury trial for February 2, 2009.\nDocket Entry, Fisher v. Maram, No. 06 C 4405 (N.D. Ill. May 19, 2008).\n4 Judge McDade conducted a bench trial between May 5 and May 7, 2008; no final\njudgment has been entered in that case.  Minute Entries, Sidell v. Maram, No. 05-1001 (C.D. Ill.\nMay 5-7, 2007)\n20\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-02211 Document #: 191  Filed: 05/30/08 Page 21 of 35 PageID #:2594\n2. The Discrimination Against Grooms\nDefendant also urges that, even if there is a private cause of action for violation of the\nintegration mandate, Grooms’s situation does not establish the basis for valid claim under that\ntheory because he does receive home care through the Illinois Medicaid program.  (Def.’s Mem.\nat 6-7.)  Specifically, Defendant contends that Grooms is eligible for and in fact enrolled in the HSP,\nand therefore has not been discriminated against because of his disability.  As Defendant points\nout, Grooms’s physician deemed him qualified to participate in the HSP, Grooms and/or his parents\nsigned documents acknowledging having a choice between home care or nursing home care, and\nGrooms has in fact received home care for years.  (Def.’s Reply at 2.)  In other words, Defendant\nargues that there has been no violation of the integration mandate because Grooms is receiving\nhome care.  But because Grooms has provided unrebutted medical evidence that the home care\nhe receives is insufficient, endangers his health, and, if not supplemented, will force him to seek\ntreatment in an institution, Defendant’s analysis is not persuasive.  Cf. Radaszewski, 2008 WL\n2097382, at *14-15 (entering judgment for Plaintiff on ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims where\nplaintiff was “at risk of being placed in an institutional setting” but cared for at home).\n3. Reasonable Accommodation\nBecause Grooms is a qualified individual with a disability and home care is appropriate for\nhim, the court must decide whether the State can reasonably accommodate Grooms’s request for\nhome care.  This requires the court to ask (1) whether a nursing home facility can meet Grooms’s\nneeds and (2) what level of care Grooms would require in an institutional facility.  Radaszewski, 383\nF.3d at 610.  Based on this information, the court can determine what it would cost to care for\nGrooms in the appropriate institution and whether providing him home care would impose a\nreasonable expense on the state.  As discussed earlier, there is no genuine dispute that a nursing\nhome facility cannot adequately meet Grooms’s needs, as the medical evidence presented by\nGrooms’s counsel is unrebutted.  In other words, the only question before the court is one of cost-\n21\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-02211 Document #: 191  Filed: 05/30/08 Page 22 of 35 PageID #:2595\nneutrality.  The State has conducted no individualized analysis of the costs associated with caring\nfor Grooms at home as opposed to in a hospital.  Thus, there is no evidence that his receipt of one-\non-one care at home would be more costly than care in a hospital setting.  See Opinion and Order,\nSidell v. Maram, No. 05-1001, at 23-24 (“Defendant has not put forward any evidence that receiving\none-on-one care in a community setting is materially different (or more costly) than hospital based\ncare. . . . Accordingly, Plaintiff’s requested level of care does not bar her claim.”).  To the contrary,\nas evidenced by his participation in the MFTDC program, until Grooms turned twenty-one, the State\nrecently determined that it was cost-neutral for him to receive home care, including sixteen hours\nper day of nursing care.  There is no evidence that this cost-neutrality analysis has changed.\nBecause the parties agree that Grooms is Medicaid-eligible, there is no dispute that Medicaid would\npay for him to receive care in a hospital.  Accordingly, there is no evidence that the State would\nbear additional costs were it to provide Grooms with the equivalent of hospital-level care at home.\nBased on the evidence that home care has been cost-effective for Grooms in past years, and the\nabsence of any basis for finding a change in Grooms’s circumstances, the court finds that HFS\ncould reasonably accommodate Grooms’s request for home care. \nInstead, Defendant focuses on the nature of the change Grooms requests and the cost of\nthat change within the system more broadly.  Beginning with the first analysis, Defendant argues\nthat requiring Illinois to expand the PWD waiver–by providing additional services, requiring selection\nof a new standard level of care, or raising cost caps–would fundamentally alter the nature of the\nservices and programs that Illinois is legally obligated to provide and does provide to persons with\ndisabling medical conditions.  As explained above, the Federal Regulations dictate that a public\nentity need only “make reasonable modifications” to comply with the integration mandate and need\nnot even make otherwise reasonable modifications if “the public entity can demonstrate that making\nthe modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.”  28\nC.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7). \n22\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-02211 Document #: 191  Filed: 05/30/08 Page 23 of 35 PageID #:2596\ni. Fundamental Alteration\nHFS suggests that, if the PWD waiver were extended such that a hospital level of care, as\nopposed to a nursing-facility level of care, is used as a benchmark for determining whether\nMedicaid assistance is cost-neutral, such an extension would fundamentally alter that program.\nHFS notes that the application it submitted to the Secretary of HHS when seeking approval of the\nPWD waiver–first approved in 1999 and then renewed in 2004–seeks reimbursement only for\nproviding home and community-based services to individuals who would otherwise require care in\na nursing facility.  (PWD Waiver Renewal dated 9/10/04, DX 9.)   The waiver format requires the\napplying state to specify whether it seeks a waiver “in order to provide home and community-based\nservices to individuals who, but for the provision of such services, would require” care in–among\nother alternatives–a nursing facility or a hospital.  (Pl.’s 56.1 ¶ 1; PWD Waiver Renewal at 3025.)\nIt was the State of Illinois’s choice to seek a waiver only for individuals who would require nursing-\nfacility level care; the option to provide a waiver for individuals who would require hospital-level care\ndemonstrates that the federal government would approve a waiver for individuals requiring a\nhospital level of care.  Indeed, there is no indication that a need for care that exceeds what is\navailable in a nursing facility disqualifies an individual for the PWD waiver.  See Opinion and Order,\nSidell v. Maram, No. 05-1001, at 19-20.  The parties agree that the State had discretion when\ndesigning the PWD waiver and is, even now, permitted to alter the waiver’s terms by submitting an\namendment to the federal government for approval.  (Def.’s Am. Resp. to Pl.’s 56.1 ¶ 3.)  Through\nthe amendment process, the State may add services to the waiver, delete services from the waiver,\nand/or change the selection of comparable institution for determining cost-neutrality.  (Id. ¶ 5.)  This\nwould not be the first time Illinois amended its waiver; the State has submitted several waivers to\nthe federal government in recent years.  (Id. ¶ 4.)5  \n5 There is no evidence in the record regarding whether these amendments resulted\n(continued...)\n23\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-02211 Document #: 191  Filed: 05/30/08 Page 24 of 35 PageID #:2597\nAs Judge Darrah explained in his decision on remand in the Radaszewski case, requiring\nthe State to submit an amendment need not fundamentally alter the HSP or Medicaid waiver\nprogram.  Radaszewski, 2008 WL 2097382.  In his Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52 findings,\nJudge Darrah observed: “Illinois could act in cooperation with the federal government to achieve\ncommunity-based integration which may otherwise be impeded by existing rules or requirements.\nThus, there is no need to adapt existing institutional-based services to a community-based  setting\nthat would impose unreasonable burdens or fundamentally alter the nature of Illinois’ services and\nprograms.”  Id. at *15. He noted, further, that the federal government has not denied a single waiver\napplication in the last ten years.  Id. at *10.  Defendant here presents no basis to believe the federal\ngovernment would deny the State’s application for an amendment in this case and the court will not\nconcoct one.  In fact, there are reasons to believe that the federal government would agree to\namend the PWD waiver.  Defendant does not dispute that the federal government encourages\nstates to use waivers to attempt to achieve community integration.  (Pl.’s 56.1 ¶ 9.)  Nor has\nDefendant established that such an amendment would impose significant costs on the State or the\nfederal government.  Accordingly, the requirement that HFS amend its waiver does not constitute\na fundamental alteration in the PWD program.\nNor would the particular additional care that Grooms seeks work a fundamental alteration.\nAs the State’s PWD waiver application makes clear, HFS did not intend to provide private-duty\nnursing, though it would provide skilled nursing services.  (PWD Waiver Renewal at 3028.)  Private-\nduty nursing is defined as continuous–rather than part-time or intermittent–licensed nursing care\nin an individual’s home.  (Id. at 3053-54.)  But the Seventh Circuit has held that increasing the hours\nof nursing care provided is not a fundamental alteration in the waiver.  “Although private-duty\nnursing services have been removed from Illinois's basic Medicaid plan, a disabled individual can\n(...continued)\nin increased costs being imposed on the State of Illinois.\n24\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-02211 Document #: 191  Filed: 05/30/08 Page 25 of 35 PageID #:2598\nstill access such services through the HSP waiver program.  However, the SCM or exceptional care\nrate approved for the individual HSP participant operates to limit the amount of nursing care that\nhe or she may receive.”  Radaszewski, 383 F.3d at 606 n.4.  That HFS already provides some\nnursing care through the PWD waiver belies the suggestion that providing additional nursing for\nGrooms would create an entirely new Medicaid service or otherwise alter the substance of the\nIllinois Medicaid program.  Radaszewski, 383 F.3d at 612. \nNext, Defendant contends that a decision for Grooms would fundamentally offer the PWD\nwaiver by abolishing two fundamental Medicaid requirements.  First, HFS suggests that for Grooms\nto prevail would eliminate the “cost-neutrality” requirement, which limits the services to which an\nindividual participating in a waiver program is entitled.  That requirement permits a State to provide\nhome or community-based care for an individual only if such care is not more expensive than the\ninstitutional care he or she needs, 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(2)(D):  thus the State is permitted to adopt,\nas a benchmark, the cost of care for an individual in an institution.  HFS need not and indeed may\nnot  provide  Medicaid  assistance  that  runs  afoul  of  the  federally-mandated  cost-neutrality\nconsiderations.  Instead, if Grooms prevails, the State will determine cost-neutrality for a disabled\nindividual  requiring  hospital-level  care  using  the  cost  of  hospital-level  care  as  its  point  of\ncomparison. \nThe parties also debate how the “medical necessity” requirement for home or community-\nbased care would function, were Grooms to prevail (and indeed, both sides offer expert testimony\non the question).  The medical necessity requirement calls for a showing, for each separate\ncomponent of the Medicaid program, that the individual served would not only benefit from but has\nan actual need for the service in question.  Bertrand v. Maram, 495 F.3d 452, 458 (7th Cir. 2007)\n(citing 42 C.F.R. § 440.230(d)).  According to Defendant’s expert, Todd D. Menenberg, a Managing\nDirector of Navigant Consulting, Inc. who consults on health care-related financial and economic\nmatters, a decision in favor of Grooms would effectively change the medical necessity requirement,\n25\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-02211 Document #: 191  Filed: 05/30/08 Page 26 of 35 PageID #:2599\nbecause it would permit any individual’s physician to evaluate the need for medical and non-\nmedical services, thus bypassing the effort of creating an HSP Plan.  (Grooms v. Maram Rebuttal\nto Samuel S. Flint Report by Todd D. Menenberg dated 5/25/07 (“Menenberg Rebuttal”) at 3-4,\nDX2.)  In Defendant’s view, “reading a requirement into the Home Services Program that David\nGrooms can receive whatever services his physician feels are medically necessary to maintain him\nin the community is not a reasonable modification.”  (Mem. at 12.)  \nDefendant’s concern appears to rest on a misinterpretation of the issues before the court.\nThe unrebutted medical evidence shows that Grooms requires hospital-level care; no medical\nassessment finds that Grooms can be cared for adequately with nursing facility-level care.  Thus,\na decision in favor of Grooms in this case would not alter the requirement that an individual seeking\nhome-based care demonstrate to the State (and not merely a testifying physician) that he or she\nhas an actual medical need for the service sought, nor would such a decision alter the process by\nwhich “medical necessity” is determined.  Nor would a decision in favor of Grooms obviate the\nrequirement that, even if an individual demonstrates medical need for a particular service, that\nservice will only be provided under the PWD waiver if the individual’s care is adjudged to be “cost-\nneutral.”  In other words, as explained above, the SCM will remain as a cap on the funding available\nonce medical need is established.  Or, under certain circumstances (such as where an individual\nis, like Grooms, ventilator-dependent), the state-calculated exceptional care rate is used.  In no\ncase will a private doctor’s definition of medical necessity undermine the program’s structure and\nrules.  Thus, for Grooms to prevail in this action would not change either statutory requirement for\nreceipt of services under the PWD program.\nFinally, Defendant points out that the Ninth Circuit has held that where a state has\nestablished a “comprehensive deinstitutionalization scheme,” that is “effectively working,” courts\nought not tinker with the state’s scheme.  Sanchez v. Johnson, 416 F.3d 1051, 1067-8 (9th Cir.\n2005) (citation omitted).  Sanchez is readily distinguishable.  In that case, the plaintiffs sought an\n26\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-02211 Document #: 191  Filed: 05/30/08 Page 27 of 35 PageID #:2600\ninjunction requiring California state officials to increase the wages and benefits paid to providers\nof community-based care for the developmentally disabled, to match the wages and benefits paid\nto employees in state institutions.  Id. at 1055.  Ultimately, the court found that these changes would\nfundamentally alter the state’s Medicaid program.  The Sanchez plaintiff sought broad changes to\nthe administration of the Medicaid program, with significant and obvious financial implications.  This\naction, on the other hand, seeks only to modify the eligibility requirements applied to a small cross-\nsection of disabled adults.  The court concludes that ruling for Grooms in this case would not\nfundamentally alter the State’s Medicaid program or PWD waiver.\nii. Cost\nDefendant also urges that the costs HFS would incur were it to accommodate Grooms with\nadditional Medicaid assistance preclude a decision in his favor.  The Supreme Court has ordered\ncourts to consider whether home or community-based care for a disabled individual “can be\nreasonably accommodated, taking into account the resources available to the State and the needs\nof others with mental disabilities.”  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 607.  When determining whether a state\nis obligated to provide the level of Medicaid assistance for home care requested by a disabled\nindividual, the Seventh Circuit has also cautioned courts “to consider the cost of a plaintiff’s care\nnot in isolation, but in the context of the care it must provide to all individuals with disabilities\ncomparable to those of the plaintiff.”  Radaszewski, 383 F.3d at 614.  In other words, the court must\nnot merely compare the cost of providing home care for Grooms, but must also consider, for\nexample, whether the State will incur greater costs if compelled to fund Grooms’s home care while\nsimultaneously providing institutional care for others who cannot or choose not to receive home or\ncommunity-based care.  Id. \nDefendant focuses on the change it expects that a ruling in favor of Groom action will effect\non the statewide PWD waiver.  In support of the argument that this change is cost-prohibitive,\nDefendant’s expert, Todd Menenberg, has provided an expert report addressing relevant cost and\n27\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-02211 Document #: 191  Filed: 05/30/08 Page 28 of 35 PageID #:2601\nfinancial issues in this matter.  (Menenberg Rept.)  Menenberg estimated that the cost to the State\nof the modification proposed by Grooms’s lawsuit would range from at least $238 million to $343\nmillion annually.  (Id. at 14.)  Menenberg reaches this conclusion by considering two additional\ncosts he concludes the State would be forced to bear, were it to implement the change Grooms\nrequests and make it available for all Medicaid recipients in his condition.  First, Menenberg\nestimated the cost to move all disabled current nursing facilities residents from their nursing\nfacilities into home or community-based care, absent SCM limitations.  (Id. at 9.)  Menenberg’s\nanalysis relied on HFS data known as the Minimum Data Set (“MDS”).  (Id. at 9 n.8.)  The MDS\nconsists of assessments completed by nursing facility residents periodically over the course of a\nyear.  (Id.)  It appears that the MDS assessment is essentially a written questionnaire sent to\nnursing facility residents, although the means by which the survey was conducted is not entirely\nclear.  Menenberg considered the most recently completed assessments in the MDS, as of\nSeptember 30, 2006.  (Id.)\nIn the MDS, Menenberg identified approximately 9,000 Medicaid-eligible individuals under\nage 60 (the age at which individuals not already grandfathered in to the Medicaid program age out\nof eligibility).  (Menenberg Rept. at 9.)  Of that number, approximately 216 answered three\nquestions in the assessment affirmatively: (1) they were not scheduled to be discharged within\nninety days; (2) they expressed a desire to leave the nursing facility; and (3) they had a support\nperson positive toward the option of such a discharge.  (Id.)  Absent an SCM cap, Menenberg\nbelieved that these 216 individuals might opt for home or community-based care as opposed to\ninstitutionalization in a nursing facility, and would be eligible for the PWD waiver.  (Id.)  But a very\nlarge number of MDS survey respondents did not answer one or more of the critical questions in\nthe MDS assessment.  Extrapolating the data from individuals who did respond to all three critical\nsurvey questions to those who did not, Menenberg estimated that there are a total of 1,100 current\nnursing facility residents who meet all three criteria.  (Id. at 10.)  Thus, Menenberg believes that\n28\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-02211 Document #: 191  Filed: 05/30/08 Page 29 of 35 PageID #:2602\napproximately 1,100 individuals might leave their nursing facilities to seek home or community-\nbased care, were Grooms to prevail.\nTurning to the cost of transitioning these individuals to home or community-based care,\nMenenberg “judgmentally selected” twenty-eight individuals based on his assessment that those\nindividuals were representative of the group of 216.  (Menenberg Rept. at 10-11.)  According to\nMenenberg, the activities of daily living (“ADL”) scores–which assess the level of assistance an\nindividual needs to complete activities such as eating, bathing, grooming, dressing, transferring,\nand incontinence–for these 28 individuals were representative of the ADL scores for the group of\n216.  (Id.)  HFS uses those scores to make the determination-of-need calculation and, ultimately,\nto set the individual’s SCM if he or she participates in the PWD waiver.  Notably, there is no\nindication, apart from their need for assistance, that these twenty-eight individuals were found\notherwise representative of the group of 216.\nHaving selected a group of twenty-eight with what he deemed representative ADL scores,\nMenenberg assessed the costs of transitioning those twenty-eight individuals from the institution\nto home or community-based care. To do so, Roberta Sue Coonrod, an RN and HFS employee,\ndeveloped a sample service plan for each of the twenty-eight.  (Menenberg Rept. at 11 & 11 n.13.)\nMenenberg then identified the average difference between the nursing facility rate as of fall 2006\nand the estimated cost of home or community-based care to be $79.94 per day; due to rate\nchanges effective January 2007, this difference was $83.01 per day in January 2007.  (Id. at 12.)\nMenenberg therefore concludes that, for the 216 identified individuals, the additional cost in the fall\nof 2006, to provide home or community-based care would be approximately $6.3 million annually;\nthe January 2007 rates translate into a cost of approximately $6.5 million annually.  From these\nfigures, Menenberg extrapolates to the 1,100 potentially eligible individuals and concludes the cost\nof allowing them home or community-based care (absent an SCM cap at the nursing facility level)\n29\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-02211 Document #: 191  Filed: 05/30/08 Page 30 of 35 PageID #:2603\nwould be approximately $32 million using the fall 2006 rates or approximately $33 million using the\nJanuary 2007 rates.   \nIn addition, Menenberg considered the cost of providing additional services to those who\nare already participating in the PWD waiver program.  According to Menenberg, if service plans\nwere no longer used to restrict Medicaid assistance afforded to the PWD waiver recipients, the\nState would incur an additional cost of approximately $206 million annually.  (Menenberg Rept. at\n13.)  If each SCM were increased by 196%–or the difference between the cost of services Grooms\nreceived under the service plan developed for him and the cost of the services he requested–the\nState would incur an additional total cost of approximately $302 million annually.  (Id. at 14.)  Again,\nMenenberg’s analysis appears to assume that all persons now participating in the PWD waiver\nprogram in fact require far more costly institutional care.\nIn response to these calculations, Plaintiff has submitted the expert report of Dr. Samuel S.\nFlint, an Assistant Professor of Public Affairs at Indiana University Northwest.  (Expert Report of\nSamuel S. Flint, Ph.D. dated 5/7/07 (“Flint Rept.”), PX 27.)  Flint criticized several facets of\nMenenberg’s analysis.  First, Flint argues that the extrapolation from the 216 surveyed nursing-\nfacility residents to the group of 1,100 was improper because the group of 216 was not a\nrepresentative sample.  (Id. at 2-4.)  According to Flint, Menenberg himself noted that 7,286–of\napproximately 9,000–individuals did not respond to the first survey question, which asked whether\nthey would like to leave the facility in which they currently lived.  (Id. at 4.)  There is no evidence\nthat explains why so many individuals declined to answer this question, or what percentage of\nrespondents answered other questions.  (Id. at 5.)  Flint therefore rejects Menenberg’s assumption\nthat the desires of the 80% of surveyed individuals who did not respond to this question were\nidentical to those of the 20% who did respond fully. (Id.)  As Flint sees the data, the fact that just\n216 of the 9,271 individuals responded affirmatively to all three questions Menenberg identified as\n30\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-02211 Document #: 191  Filed: 05/30/08 Page 31 of 35 PageID #:2604\ncritical suggests that 216 is the absolute ceiling for the first group of individuals who Menenberg\nsurveyed.  (Id.)\nFlint also believes that Menenberg’s calculations are otherwise inflated.  As discussed\nabove, Menenberg’s numbers purport to exclude any skilled nursing facility residents who will be\ndischarged within ninety days of responding to the survey.  Flint points out that 193 responding\nindividuals expressed uncertainty about their date of discharge, and that none of those 193 were\nexcluded from Menenberg’s analysis.  (Flint Rept. at 5.)  Since approximately 68% of individuals\nliving in a skilled nursing facility are discharged within ninety days, it follows that some of the\nindividuals who are uncertain about their date of discharge may well be discharged within ninety\ndays.  (Id.)  Excluding these 193 from the group of 216, no more than twenty-three (one-quarter of\none percent) current nursing-facility residents definitively meet all three Menenberg criteria.  (Id.)\nSecond, Flint critiqued Menenberg’s methodology for identifying the cost of transitioning the\nindividuals who do meet the Menenberg criteria from nursing-facility care to home or community-\nbased care.  (Flint Rept. at 6.)  Flint opines that Menenberg’s decision not to use a random sample\nbut, rather, to make a conscious selection of twenty-eight individuals and then assess the costs\nassociated with their particular situations, likely resulted in skewed cost projections.  (Id.)  For\nexample, Flint points out that three of the twenty-eight selected individuals were eligible for an\nexceptional care rate, which is afforded only to the sickest 1% (only 540 of 47,624) of skilled\nnursing facility patients.  (Id.)  Individuals receiving an exceptional care rate were therefore\nsignificantly over-represented in Menenberg’s judgmentally selected population.  Flint calculated\nthat there is a .0003 chance that a random sampling process would so significantly over-represent\nthe population of exceptional care rate patients.  (Id.)  According to Flint, by including so many of\nthe sickest skilled nursing facility patients in his judgmentally-selected sample, Menenberg inflated\nthe costs of transitioning current skilled nursing facility residents to home or community-based care.\n(Id. at 7.)  In addition, Flint contends that Menenberg’s sample size was insufficient to make\n31\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-02211 Document #: 191  Filed: 05/30/08 Page 32 of 35 PageID #:2605\nestimates for a population of approximately 9,000.  (Id. at 7.)  Finally, Flint points out that\nMenenberg relied on one nurse to develop projected service plans, and that her employment by\nHFS suggests the possibility of bias.  (Id. at 7-8.) \nWith regard to the group of current PWD participants whose benefits would, according to\nDefendant, increase, were Grooms to prevail, Flint identifies what he believes are several flaws with\nthe Menenberg analysis.  First, Flint observes, there is no basis for Menenberg’s assumption that\ncurrent Medicaid policies–including utilization review and medical necessity guidelines–will be\nabandoned in favor of giving Medicaid-eligible individuals whatever benefits they seek.  (Flint Rept.\nat 9.)  Flint also disagrees with Menenberg’s opinion that all PWD beneficiaries would be eligible\nfor additional benefits: only 3.3% of the current PWD beneficiary population–or 864 individuals–are\ncurrently receiving assistance that reaches the SCM cap.  (Id. at 11.)  Thus, the other 96.7% of\nPWD waiver recipients presumably do not require and would not be eligible for additional Medicaid\nbenefits, were the SCM cap raised or removed.  Thus, any alteration to the SCM would only impact\na small minority of PWD waiver recipients.  Flint also points out that Grooms’s current care plan\nentitles him to exceptional care.  Grooms’s exceptional care rate exceeds the highest current SCM\ncap, and thus it is unclear to Flint why current PWD beneficiaries (most of whom, as explained\nabove, are not entitled to the exceptional care rate) would benefit in any way from a decision\naltering Grooms’s Medicaid benefits.  (Id.)6 \nCorrecting for these claimed flaws in Menenberg’s analysis, Flint provides his own cost\nestimates.  With respect to impact on the group of current nursing-facility residents, Flint estimates\nthat the cost to the State, were Groom to prevail (and the same relief accorded to all similarly\nsituated individuals) ranges from less than zero to, at most, $6 million.  (Flint Rept. at 8.)  With\n6 The Seventh Circuit highlighted but deferred ruling on this issue in Radaszewski, 383\nF.3d 599.  There, the court deemed it “not immediately apparent” whether the relevant group of\ndisabled persons for purposes of a fundamental-alteration defense should be defined.  Id. at 614\nn.5.\n32\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-02211 Document #: 191  Filed: 05/30/08 Page 33 of 35 PageID #:2606\nregard to current PWD participants, Flint estimates that the cost of generalizing the more generous\nPWD waiver Grooms seeks would range from zero dollars to, in the event of a 30% increase in\nbenefits afforded to all 864 eligible PWD beneficiaries, $456,372.  (Flint Rept. at 11.)  Suggesting\nthat these numbers are likely over-estimates, Flint points out that Illinois is “over-bedded” in nursing\nfacilities: it has only 4.3% of the United States population, but 5.1% of the nation’s skilled nursing\nfacilities and 6% of the nation’s skilled nursing facility beds.  (Flint Rept. at 12.)7  Likewise, Illinois\nspends 7.5% of its annual Medicare expenditures for beneficiaries on skilled nursing facilities,\ncompared to an average of 5.4% for other states.  (Id. at 13.)  He also points out that individuals\nwhose medical needs would not qualify them for institutionalization in other states are deemed\nappropriate for entry into skilled nursing facilities in Illinois.  (Id.)  Thus, Flint identifies a bias toward\ninstitutionalization in Illinois, and a resistance, in Illinois’s Medicaid program, to provision of home\nor community-based care.  (Id.) \nConsidering substantially similar analyses from Menenberg and Flint, one district court has\nfound Menenberg’s opinions devoid of reliable principles and methodology and deemed them not\ncredible or persuasive.  Radaszewski, 2008 WL 2097382, at *10-12.  Addressing the population\nof currently institutionalized individuals who might seek home or community-based care, that court\nnoted that Menenberg had not identified any individuals in a situation similar to that of Eric\nRadaszewski, in that his needs could not be met with a nursing facility level of care.  Id. at *11.  The\nsame is true here: Menenberg has focused on all Illinois nursing facility residents, rather than\nisolating the discrete group of individuals who require hospital-level care.   The Radaszewski court\nfound significant Menenberg’s failure to use random sampling and his reliance on the assessments\nof a single, HFS-employed nurse.  Id. at *12.  With regard to the population of current PWD\n7 This circumstance suggests the possibility that in order to balance the state Medicaid\nbudget, a certain percentage of the institutional beds be full.   If the circumstance is the basis for\nthe state’s resistance to providing home or community-based care for individuals with extraordinary\nneeds, it has failed to make this explicit.\n33\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-02211 Document #: 191  Filed: 05/30/08 Page 34 of 35 PageID #:2607\nbeneficiaries, Judge Darrah rejected, as unsubstantiated, Menenberg’s premise that all HSP\nparticipants would seek and receive additional services up to and beyond the SCM cap.  Id. at *11.\nThere, as in this case, Menenberg had failed to identify any individual in a similar situation to the\nplaintiff, with similar needs and requirements.  Id.  Based in part on his analysis of the expert\nopinions, on May 9, 2008, Judge Darrah entered a permanent injunction enjoining HFS from\nreducing Eric’s coverage to anything less than sixteen hours per day of skilled nursing services\nprovided by a registered nurse at Eric’s parents’ home seven days per week as well as an\nadditional 336 hours per year of respite care.  Opinion and Order, Radaszewski v. Maram, No. 01\nC 9551 (N.D. Ill. May 9, 2008).  At this stage, the court concludes that Menenberg’s calculations\nare not sufficient to entitle Defendant to summary judgment in this case. \nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons set forth above, Defendant Barry S. Maram’s Motion for Summary\nJudgment (149) is denied.  Plaintiff David Grooms has not sought summary judgment in his favor.\nAs  explained  above,  the  court  expects,  to  grant  Plaintiff  David  Grooms  preliminary  relief.\nAccordingly a status hearing is set for Monday, June 9, 2008, at 9:00 a.m., at which the court will\ndetermine the preliminary and/or permanent relief to which Grooms is entitled.\nFinally, the court notes that, during the course of briefing the pending motions, the parties\nhave not answered several questions significant to this litigation.  The court therefore invites\nadditional submissions to illuminate certain issues that remain unclear, many of which were\nidentified by the Seventh Circuit as critical to any final decision in this case:\n1. Where would Grooms receive care if he is no longer able to continue receiving care\nat home (e.g. state-run institution or private facility)?  See Radaszewski, 383 at 614.\n2. If Grooms were placed in an institution, what services would he receive in this\ninstitution?  See Radaszewski, 383 at 610.  In particular, would Grooms be entitled\nto private-duty nursing care?\n3. If Grooms were placed in an institution, would HFS be required to provide him with\nthe level of care he needs in order to survive?  See Radaszewski, 383 at 611.\n34\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-02211 Document #: 191  Filed: 05/30/08 Page 35 of 35 PageID #:2608\n4. If Grooms were placed in an institution, what amount would the services Grooms\nwould receive there cost the State?  See Radaszewski, 383 at 613-14.\n5. If Grooms continues to receive home care, what amount would home care at a\nhospital-level of care cost the state?  See Radaszewski, 383 at 613-14.\n6. If Grooms continues to receive home care, what other costs would the state bear,\nconsidering that enabling Grooms to receive home care would not necessarily\npermit the state to close or reduce the size of its existing institutions?  See\nRadaszewski, 383 at 614.\n7. Given that the court must take into account the needs of “other persons with the\nsame broad type of disabilities” to assess a fundamental alteration defense, what\nis the relevant group of disabled persons in this case, for purposes of making this\ncalculation?  See Radaszewski, 383 at 614 n.4.\n8. Given that the court must taken into account the broader context of the State’s\nMedicaid program, what impact do the empty beds Flint has identified have on the\ncost-benefit analysis in this action?\nENTER:\nDated: May 30, 2008 _________________________________________\nREBECCA R.

MARAM,  Director  of  the  Illinois \nDepartment of Healthcare and Family Services, in his official capacity only, by his \nattorney, LISA MADIGAN, Attorney General of Illinois, and hereby objects to Plaintiff's \nMotion for Preliminary Injunction, stating as follows: \n  1.  On March 13, 2007, Plaintiff filed his Motion for Preliminary Injunction.  \n(Grooms v. Maram, 06 C 2211, Civil Docket No. 42).  This Motion was filed eleven \nmonths after Plaintiff filed his Complaint in this action on or about April 20, 2006.  The \nComplaint, in turn, was filed some six months after Plaintiff began receiving benefits \nunder the Persons with Disabilities Waiver of the Home Service Program. \n  2.  Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction should be denied because:  1) the \nMotion for Preliminary Injunction is not supported by any evidentiary material, and 2) \nPlaintiff  is  not  entitled  to  a  preliminary  injunction  because  he  has  delayed  seeking \npreliminary relief.  In the alternative, any hearing on preliminary injunction should be \nconsolidated with the trial on the merits under F.R.Civ.P. 65(a)(2). \n \n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 44      Filed 03/27/2007     Page 2 of 6\nTHE MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nIS NOT SUPPORTED BY EVIDENTIARY MATERIALS \n \n  3.  A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary and drastic remedy, one that \nshould not be granted unless the movant, by a clear showing, carries the burden of \npersuasion.    Mazurek  v.  Armstrong,  520  U.S.  968,  972,  117  S.Ct.  1865  (1977).  \nAccordingly, the motion for preliminary injunction must be accompanied by affidavits or \na verified complaint.  See, Bascom Food Prods. v. Reese Finer Foods, Inc., 715 F.Supp. \n616, 624 n. 14 (D.N.J. 1989). \n  4.    Plaintiff's  Motion  for  Preliminary  Injunction  is  not  supported  by  any \nevidentiary materials, such as affidavits.  Moreover, the Complaint filed in this action on \nor about April 20, 2006 was not verified. \n  5.  Consequently, Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction is fatally flawed \nand must be denied since it lacks any evidentiary basis to make a clear showing of \nentitlement to an \"extraordinary and drastic remedy.\"  Mazurek, 520 U.S. at 972. \nPLAINTIFF HAS DELAYED SEEKING PRELIMINARY \nRELIEF UNTIL NEAR THE CLOSE OF DISCOVERY \n  6.    Plaintiff  filed  his  Complaint  in  this  action  on  or  about  April  20,  2006.  \nHowever, Plaintiff has been continuously eligible for and enrolled in the Persons with \nDisabilities Waiver since he turned 21 years old on October 8, 2005, and signed-off on a \nService Plan as recently as January 24, 2007.  In order to be eligible and receive benefits \nand services under the Persons with Disabilities Waiver, an individual's physician must \ncertify that the care plan developed can safely provide care to the individual in the home.  \nPlaintiff  participated  in  the  Persons  with  Disabilities  Waiver  for  approximately  six \nmonths  before  he  filed  his  Complaint.    Plaintiff  did  not  seek  preliminary  relief \ncontemporaneously with the filing of his Complaint. \n  2\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 44      Filed 03/27/2007     Page 3 of 6\n  7.  On June 15, 2006, this Court entered a scheduling order setting forth the \nsequence of discovery, expert disclosure dates, the close of all discovery on April 27, \n2007, and setting this matter for trial on July 16, 2007.  (Grooms v. Maram, 06 C 2211, \nCivil Docket No. 13). \n  8.  The parties have engaged in discovery.  Plaintiff has not disclosed any retained \nexpert witnesses.  Defendant disclosed his retained expert, the expert's report, and has \nmade available to Plaintiff documents utilized by the retained expert, in conformance \nwith this Court's order entered March 5, 2007.  (Grooms v. Maram, 06 C 2211, Civil \nDocket No. 41). \n9.  A preliminary injunction is sought upon the theory that there is an urgent need \nfor speedy action to protect the plaintiff's rights.  By sleeping on his rights, a plaintiff \ndemonstrates the lack of need for speedy action.  Lydo Enterprises, Inc. v. City of Las \nVegas, 745 F.2d 1211, 1213 (9th Cir. 1984).  While a plaintiff's delay in seeking an \ninjunction is not alone a basis to withhold relief, it is a fact to be considered in measuring \nthe claim of urgency.  Id. at 1214; Flint v. Dennison, 336 F.Supp 2d 1065, 1070 (D. \nMont. 2004). \n10.  Plaintiff's delay in seeking preliminary relief, taken in conjunction with the \nfact that he has, since October 8, 2005, been certified by his physician to participate in \nthe Persons with Disabilities Waiver belies any claim that he has an urgent need for \nspeedy action to protect his rights. \nSHOULD THE COURT WISH TO DETERMINE WHETHER \nPRELIMINARY RELIEF MAY BE APPROPRIATE, THE COURT \nSHOULD CONSOLIDATE THE HEARING FOR THE PRELIMINARY \nINJUNCTION WITH THE TRIAL ON THE MERITS \n \n  11.  Pursuant to F.R.Civ.P. 65(a)(2), before or after the commencement of hearing \nof an application for a preliminary injunction, the court may order the trial of the action \n  3\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 44      Filed 03/27/2007     Page 4 of 6\non the merits to be advanced and consolidated with the hearing of the application.  See \nalso Proimos v. Fair Auto Repair, Inc., 808 F.2d 1273, 1277-78 (7th Cir. 1987). \n  12.  As detailed in Paragraphs 7 and 8 above, discovery is set to close shortly and \nthe July 16, 2007 trial date can be advanced.  Defendant is prepared to go to trial in this \nmatter.  Given the stage of the proceedings, it would certainly be judicially economical to \nadvance the trial date and consolidate the preliminary injunction hearing with trial on the \nmerits.  Defendant would propose a trial date, based on the Court's availability, sometime \nafter May 7, 2007.  This date would allow the parties to compile their final pre-trial order \nmaterials to be prepared and submitted to the court after the close of discovery on April \n27, 2007. \n  WHEREFORE, for the reasons stated above, Defendant respectfully requests that \nthe court: \n  1)  Deny Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction; or \n  2)  Advance the trial of the action on the merits and consolidate the trial with the \nhearing of the preliminary injunction on or after May 7, 2007; or \n  3)  Allow Defendant such time to present evidence and a memorandum of law to \nrespond to any such submission the Court may allow Plaintiff to file in support of his \nMotion for Preliminary Injunction. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  4\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 44      Filed 03/27/2007     Page 5 of 6\nRespectfully submitted, \nLISA MADIGAN \nAttorney General of Illinois \n \nBy:  John E.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n1.  Plainti ff David Grooms (David) reached the age of 21 years old on October 8, \n2005.  David has Type II Glycogen Storage Disease (GSD Type II).  David's condition was \ndiagnosed when he was abont 12 years old.  GSD Type IT is a muscle disease that progressively \naffects skeletal muscle and muscles involved in respiration.  David's condition has resulted in \nquadriplegia.  David is eligible for assistance under the Medicaid Program. \n2.  Although David's cognitive ability is unimpaired, all of his body functions have \nbeen compromised and his medical needs are very complex.  David relies on others for virtually \nall care and mobility.  He does have some use of his hands, and is therefore able to drink from a \nstraw without assistance, to feed himself certain foods, and to use a computer.  Aside from these \nlimited activities, David has no control of his limbs. \n3.  During 2005, the l11inois Department of Health care and Family Services (HFS) \napproved and paid for monthly benefits that allowed David to obtain services in his own home \nand avoid institutionalil,ation, Payment for the care was through a Medicaid waiver program for \nchildren who have exceptional medical needs who would be institutionalized at state expense if \n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 1     Filed 04/20/2006     Page 2 of 9 \nnot given care at homc.  HFS approved the extensive nursing services plan for David based on its \ndetermination that the services were mcdically necessary and that the cost ofthc care David \nneeded to remain at home was less than the cost of the carc in a hospital or other institutional \nsetting. \n4.  At the end of2005, HFS significantly cut funding for David's in-home nursing \nservices.  The reduction was based solely On the fact that David reached the age of21 ycars on \nOctobcr 8, 2005; it was not due to a changc in his medical needs or in the cost to HFS for the \ncarc he would require in an institutional setting.  Due to the reduction in funding by HFS, David \nfaces an impossible choicc in the coming months:  remaining at home with severely reduccd \nservices or moving to an institution.  The laUer choice would require that he be removed from \nfamily and community in order to receive the care that he needs.  The fonner places him in \ndanger of a lethal medical crisis. \n5.  David seeks declaratory relief that the actions of HFS and its director constitute \nillegal discrimination under Title II ofthe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C § \n12132, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 u.S.C § 794(a}.  David also seeks \ninjunctive relief to require HFS and its director to provide nursing and othcr home services to \nhim at the level that he received prior to turning 21. \nn.  JURISDICTION \n6.  Jurisdiction is conferred on this Court by 28 U.S.C § 1331.  Declaratory relief is \nauthorized under 28 U.S.c. § 22(H. \n7.  David's discrimination claims are brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12133 and 29 \nU.S.C § 794. \n2 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 1     Filed 04/20/2006     Page 3 of 9 \nIll.  PARTIES \n8.  David resides in LaSalle County, Illinois. \n9.  Defendant Barry S. Maram is the Director of the Illinois Department of \nHealthcare and Family Services (HFS). \nIV.  FACTS \n10.  David is 21 years old.  His date ofbirth is October 8, 1984. \nII.  David is an individual with a disability and is eligible for Medicaid. \n12.  The Medicaid program is ajoint federal and state funded program enacted to \nprovide necessary medical assistance to needy aged or disabled persons and families with \ndependant children. whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the cost of care. 42 \nU .s.C. § 1396.  States choosing to participate in the Medicaid program must operate the program \nin conformity with federal statutory and regulatory requirements.  42 U.S.C.§ 1396a. \n13.  Each State participating in the Medicaid program must submit a Medicaid Plan to \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) for approval.  42 U.S.C. § 1396. \n14.  Each State that participates in the Medicaid program must also designate a single \nstate agency to administer and/or supervise the administration of that state's Medicaid Plan. 42 \nU.S.C. § 1396a(a)(5). \nIS.  In Illinois, HFS is the single state agency responsible for administering the \nMedicaid program. \n16.  States have the option under Medicaid of providing home and community based \nservices to persons who would otherwise require institutional care. 42 U.S.C. Sec 1396n(c)(1). \nHome and community based services are provided through HHS-approved \"waiver\" programs. \nUnder HHS' waiver authority, the Secretary of HHS may grant waivers  r specified \n0 \n3 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 1     Filed 04/20/2006     Page 4 of 9 \nrequirements, such as service limitations, that are otherwise applicable to the state's Medicaid \nPlan. 42 U.S.c. § 1396n(c)(3).  Waiver programs must be cost-neutral in that the average cost of \nproviding care for program participants in the home or community based setting must not exceed \nthe estimated average cost ofprovidillg care in the institutional setting they would reqlLire. 42 \nU.S.c. § 1396n(c)(2)(D), 42 C.F.R. § 441. 302(E). \n17.  The Secretary oflIHS has approved waivers in Illinois for Medically Fragile and \nTechnology Dependent Children (Medically Fragile Children's Waiver) and for lIome Services \nfor Adults with Disabilities (Adult Home Services Waiver). \n18.  Under the Medically Fragile Children's Waiver, HI'S pays for home based care \nfor children under age 21 who have exceptional medical needs.  HFS administers this waiver \nprogram with participation orthe University oflllinois Division of Specialized Services for \nChildren (DSSC) under an agreement with lIFS. \n19.  Under the Adult Home Services Waiver, lIFS provides funds to enable disabled \nadults to remain in their homes or in a community setting.  HFS administers the IISP program \nwith the participation ofthe Department or Rehabilitative Services (DRS) of the lIlinois \nDepartment of Human Services under an agreement with HFS. \n20.  David's condition, known as GSD Type IT, was diagnosed in or about 1996 when \nhe was about 12 years old. \n21.  David's physical condition has progressively worsened since the condition was \ndiagnosed.  David currently has quadriplegia and is 100% ventilator dependent. \n22.  David has complex medical needs and requires constant monitoring. His medical \ncondition must be assessed constantly. David requires the service of a registered nurse or a \n4 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 1     Filed 04/20/2006     Page 5 of 9 \nlicensed practical nurse to care for certain of his medical needs, such as those associated with his \nventilator. \n23.  David's mother, Kathy Grooms, has diabetes.  She was hospitalized on several \noccasions during 2005 and 2006 due to complications from diabetes, with the most recent \nhospitalization occurring in or about March of 2006. \n24.  David's father, David Grooms, Sr., works full time to support his family. \n25.  HFS approved David's care plan as a medically necessary and cost effective \nalternative to the care in the institutional setting it determined David would otherwise require. \n26.  HFS paid for David's skilled nursing care under the Medically Fragile Children's \nWaiver. \n27.  During 2005, HFS approved and paid for approximately $16,000.00 for monthly \nmedical services provided by a registered nurse and a licensed practical nurse. The monthly \nbenefits allowed David to meet the costs of salaries and benefits for the medical care that his \ncondition requires. In addition to nursing services, the benefits allowed David to receive \napproximately $1,000.00 per month for respite care. His mother and father provided the halance \nof David's care. In the year before David reached the age of 21 years, the cost ofthe services he \nreceived amounted to approximately $221,760.00. \n28.  As David's 21st birthday approached, DSSC staff began informing David and his \nparents that David would \"age out\" ofthe Medically Fragile Children's Waiver and that he \nwould thereafter he required to transition into the Adult Home Services Waiver. \n29.  In May of2005, David and his family participated in a conference concerning \nDavid's care.  Representatives of DRS and DSSC also attended.  At the meeting, DRS infornled \nDavid that funding for pediatric patients is decreased once a child reaches the age of 21 hecause \n5 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 1     Filed 04/20/2006     Page 6 of 9 \nthere are only II pediatric nursing facilities in the state, as compared with over 700 adult \nfacilities. \n30.  Tn late 2005, HFS approved a new care plan that reduccd David's monthly \nfunding to approximately $8,620.00. This amount translates into approximately $103,440.00 per \nyear, less than halfoftbe previous funding level. The amount is not sufficicnt to meet the costs \noftbe nursing scrvices tbat David requires, nor is the amount sufficient to allow for respite care. \n31.  David's parents arc not able to increase the level of care that they provided prior \nto David turning 21, due to their own health concerns and work demands. \n32.  The reduction in services hy HFS is hased solely on the fact that David reached \nthc age of2l years on October 8, 2005. The reduction in funding is not due to a change in \nDavid's medical needs.  David wants to remain in his home and not he isolated in an institution. \nHe has greatly benefited from the love and support of his mother and father, as well as of his \nextended family, all of whom arc actively involvcd in David's life. \n33.  David's physicians have determined that David can be cared for at home safely \nand appropriately. \n34.  Under the laws governing the Adult Home Services Waiver, HFS has discretion \nto set funding for services for ventilator dependent pcrsons and otllers whose needs cannot be \nmet by otherwise applicable caps, provided that the waiver program is cost-neutral. \n35.  With no modifleation in its regulations, and little modification in its practices, \nHFS could continue to fund the level of nursing care that David requires in order to remain at \nhome at a cost less than would be required to serve him in a hospital or other specialized \ninstitution for the care he needs. \n6 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 1     Filed 04/20/2006     Page 7 of 9 \n36.  The current reduction in funding for nUTsing care will ultimately force David into \nan institutional setting, isolating him from home and community. \n37.  Title n oftlle Americans with Disahilities Act, 42 U.S.c. § 12132, prohihits \npublic entities from discriminating against persons with disabilities in the delivery of services. \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a), prohibits rccipients of federal funds \nfrom discriminating against qualified pcrsons wiili disabilities.  Policies and practices iliat have \nthe effects of unjustifiably segregating persons with disabilities in institutions constitute \nprohibited discrimination under both Acts. \n38.  Under 28 C.F.R. § 35.l30(d), implementing Title II ofilie ADA, public cntities \nmust administer serviccs in ilie most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of quali fied \nindividuals with disabilities.  This same requirement applies to recipients of federal funds under \nthe regulations implementing thc Rehabilitation Act.  28 C.F.R. § 41 Sled). \n39.  HFS is a public entity within the meaning of Title II ofthe ADA and is a reeipieut \noffederal funds under thc Rehabilitation Act. \n40.  David is a qualified individual with a disability within the meaning ofTiOe IT of \nthe ADA and undcr Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, \n41.  The actions by taken by HFS with respect to David's serviccs constitute unlawful \ndiscrimination under 42 U.S.C. § J 2321 and 29 U.S.c. § 794(a) and violate the integration \nmandate ofthe regulations implementing these statutory prohibitions.  28 C.F.R. § 130.S1(d) and \n41.51 (d). \n42.  Defendant's actions have caused and will continue to causc David irreparable \ninjury fOT which thcre is no adequate remedy oflaw. \n7 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 1     Filed 04/20/2006     Page 8 of 9 \nV.  CLAIMS \n43.  David's sole income is the funding that he receives through HFS. \n44.  Defendant's reduction offunding for the home nursing and other services David \nneeds in order to avoid institutionalization violates 42 U.S.c. § 12321 and 29 U.S.c. § 794(a) \nand their implementing regulations, 28 C.F.R. § 130.51(d), 41.51(d). \nVI.  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n45.  Plaintiff prays for the following relief: \nA.  That this Court enter a declaratory judgment that Defendant's reduction in \nfunding  violates  lJ.S.c.  §  12132  and  29  U.S.c.  §  794(a),  and  their  implementing \nregulations, 28 C.F.R. § 130.51(d), and 41.51(d). \nB.  That this Court restore David's pre-age 21  levcls of funding  for home \nnursing services. \nC.  That  this  Court  preliminarily  and  permanently  enjoin  Defendant's \nreduction in services for David's home nursing services. \nD.  That the COllrt award plaintiff costs and fees. \nE.

What it does not do, however, is present evidence from which a \nreasonable trier of fact could conclude that Defendant’s affirmative defenses have been \nestablished.  Defendant has offered neither legal nor factual support for his defenses-- \ncalamities that he predicts would result in this single-plaintiff case from a ruling in \nPlaintiff’s favor.  This Court should therefore reject those defenses as a matter of law and \nbar any evidence offered in support thereof at trial.  \n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 79      Filed 06/29/2007     Page 2 of 11\n \n1.  A Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is a Proper Vehicle \n for a Pretrial Challenge to Affirmative Defenses. \n    \n   Defendant contends that this Court may not entertain Plaintiff’s Motion for Partial \nSummary Judgment because it does not seek a final “judgment,” because it improperly \nseeks to “partition” Defendant’s claims, and because Plaintiff has not yet proven his right \nto relief, a predicate for consideration of an affirmative defense.  Defendant’s arguments \nare without merit and evince a misunderstanding of the difference between a claim and a \ndefense and the difference between a pleadings-based motion (motion to strike) and an \nevidence-based motion (motion for partial summary judgment).  See, e.g., Wilson v. \nSundstrand Corp., Nos. 99 C 6944, 99 C 6946, 2003 WL 21961359, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Aug. \n18, 2003) (“Plaintiffs are seeking summary judgment on the defenses; they have not \nmoved to strike them for inadequate pleading.”). \nContrary to Defendant’s assertion, a motion for partial summary judgment is widely \naccepted as a means of testing the legal sufficiency of affirmative defenses using \nsummary judgment standards.    Rubin v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 408 F. Supp. 2d 549, \n552 (N.D. Ill. 2005) (“Courts in the Northern District of Illinois routinely entertain \nmotions for partial summary judgment.”)  Numerous cases in the Seventh Circuit in \nwhich motions for partial summary judgment on affirmative defenses were considered.  \nSee, e.g. Illinois School Dist. Agency v. Pacific Ins. Co., Ltd., 471 F.3d 714  (7th Cir. \n2006); Certain Underwriters of Lloyd’s v. Gen. Accident Ins. Co., 909 F.2d 228 (7th Cir. \n1990); Hanania  v. Loren-Maltese, 319 F. Supp. 2d 814 (N.D. Ill. 2004).  This Court has \nentertained such a motion.  See  Mahurkar v. C.R. Bard, Inc., No. 01 C 8452, 2004 WL \n1982531 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 7, 2004, Pallmeyer, J.).  Finally, the very case relied upon by \n  2\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 79      Filed 06/29/2007     Page 3 of 11\nDefendant in his “partition” argument, addressed below, recognizes that courts “routinely \nentertain motions for partial summary judgment seeking the dismissal of affirmative \ndefenses.”  Petroff Trucking Co., Inc. v. Environcon, Inc., No. 05-CV-414-WDS, 2006 \nWL 2938666, at *2 (S.D. Ill. Oct. 13, 2006). \n  Defendant argues that the Court may not enter a real “judgment” for Plaintiff \nbased on this motion and therefore it is not properly a motion for partial summary \njudgment.  It is true that a final judgment will not be entered, but that is also true, for \nexample, when a court enters a partial summary judgment on liability and leaves the issue \nof damages for the jury.  The partial summary judgment device is used to eliminate \nclaims or defenses from the trial which, based on the undisputed material facts, are \nwithout legal merit.  Id. at *3 (“Its purpose is to ‘frame and narrow the triable issues’”). \n  Also contrary to Defendant’s assertion, Plaintiff’s motion is not an untimely \nmotion to strike. It does not challenge the sufficiency of Defendant’s pleading of his \naffirmative defenses, but rather their evidentiary sufficiency under applicable law, and is \nthus properly raised by a motion for partial summary judgment after reasonable time for \ndiscovery.  Wilson, 2003 WL 21961359, at *4 (“[P]laintiffs do not attempt to show \naffirmatively that these ‘defenses’ lack merit. Rather they essentially argue that \n[Defendant] cannot support any of them. A party may properly seek summary judgment \nby essentially throwing the ball into the court of the party with the burden of proof.”).  \nPlaintiff’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is timely, according to the schedule set \nby this Court.     \n  Nor does Plaintiff improperly seek to partition a “claim.”  First, the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure allow summary judgment on part of a claim.  Wilson, 2003 WL \n  3\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 79      Filed 06/29/2007     Page 4 of 11\n21961359, at *4.  Further, Plaintiff’s motion does not really address part of a “claim for \nrelief.” Rubin, 408 F. Supp. at *4. Defendant has not filed a counterclaim; he has raised \naffirmative defenses.  These defenses seek to defeat Plaintiff’s entire claim for relief.  \nThey are thus properly the subject of a motion for partial summary judgment.  Petroff, \n2006 WL 2938666, at *3 (“Although there is reasonable debate on the propriety of \ngranting partial summary judgment on a motion that seeks to dispose of less than an \nentire claim, the court finds that Rule 56(d) permits the disposition of a motion for partial \nsummary judgment on an affirmative defense.”).  \n2.  Defendant’s “Ripeness” Argument is Frivolous, and His  “Integration \nMandates”  Discussion is Irrelevant to the Pending Motion.   \n \nIn his second argument, Defendant asserts that “Plaintiff’s Motion Is Not Ripe \nFor Adjudication By This Court.”  Under this heading, Defendant’s brief oddly wanders \ninto a discussion of the viability of Plaintiff’s cause of action, which is not at issue in the \ninstant motion, and asserts that Plaintiff has “abandoned” his claims under the ADA and \nthe Rehabilitation Act by relying upon the “integration mandates” of the regulations.  \n  First, for the reasons stated above, Plaintiff’s motion is not premature.  The \nmyriad courts that have entertained motions for partial summary judgment on affirmative \ndefenses do not hold trials on the plaintiff’s claims before considering whether to grant a \nmotion for partial summary judgment on the defenses. Rather, for the purpose of the \nmotion only, they treat the plaintiff’s claim as if it were meritorious and then move on to \nevaluate whether the defenses would bar the claim.  See, e.g., Holden v. Balko, 949 F. \nSupp. 704, 706 (S.D. Ind. 1996) (“[F]or purposes of deciding the plaintiffs’ motion for \nsummary judgment on this affirmative defense, the court will assume (as the defendants \n  4\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 79      Filed 06/29/2007     Page 5 of 11\nassume for the purposes of pleading the defense) that plaintiffs can prove the essential \nelements of their . . . claims.”).1  \nDefendant’s contention that the motion is not “ripe” because the allegations have \nnot been established as facts is not supported by any case law.  Indeed, it is contrary to \nexisting case law. Wilson, 2003 WL 21961359, at *4. (“[Defendant] argues that the \nmotion [for partial summary judgment on affirmative defenses] is premature. It most \ndecidedly is not.”). \n  Defendant’s “integration mandates” argument, however, is premature, because it \ngoes to the Plaintiff’s case-in-chief, which is not now before the Court.2  Defendant states \nthat the Court will have to decide “whether Plaintiff has a claim under the pertinent \nrules,” and will have to “resolve whether the rules exceeded the authority granted by \nCongress.”  (Def’s Resp. to Pl.’s Mot. 6 ).  That may be so.  But the Court need not \ndecide those issues in the context of this motion, and it would be inappropriate for the \nCourt to do so. Neither Plaintiff nor Defendant has moved for summary judgment on \nPlaintiff’s claim, nor has Defendant moved to dismiss under Rule 12 (b)(6). The \nsufficiency of Plaintiff’s cause of action is thus not before this Court at this time.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1 This is why it was appropriate for Plaintiff’s Rule 56 Statement of Material Facts Not in Dispute to recite \nas  “facts” the filing of the Complaint and the existence of certain allegations within it. By referring to the \nundisputed fact that certain allegations were made, Plaintiff placed his motion on affirmative defenses \nwithin the context of his claims, so that the Court could properly address whether the defenses would defeat \nthe claims if and when they were proven.   \n2 It is also plainly wrong.  Plaintiff’s cause of action is clearly based upon his rights under the ADA and \nRehabilitation act as those laws have been implemented and interpreted by regulation and interpreted by the \ncourts. See, e.g., Radaszewski v. Maram, 383 F.3d 599 (7th Cir. 2004); Sidell v. Maram, No. 05-1001 \n*(C.D. Ill. May 14, 2007); Fisher v. Maram, No. 06 C 4405, 2006 WL 2505833 (N.D. Ill.

Defendant has not Met His Burden of Demonstrating Through Evidence and \nLegal Analysis a Genuine Issue of Fact That is Material to the Affirmative \nDefenses at Issue in This Motion. \n \na.  Plaintiff Has Met Its Burden As The Moving Party \nIn his Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, Plaintiff analyzed, in the light most \nfavorable to the Defendant, the expert report that Plaintiff expects Defendant to offer in \nsupport of his affirmative defenses, on which the Defendant has the burden of proof.  \nPlaintiff has contended that there is an absence of admissible evidence from which a \nreasonable trier of fact could conclude that the defenses have been established. \nSpecifically, Plaintiff asserted in his motion that, even if the Report’s factual \ndetermination regarding the number of persons who would seek additional benefits is \naccepted for the purpose of this motion (it is otherwise disputed), the conclusion that the \nState would incur massive costs if David Grooms obtains relief in this case is not \nsupported by admissible evidence because the report did not address the impact on \nbenefits of the federal legal requirements of cost neutrality and medical necessity, neither \nof which David Grooms seeks to dislodge.  \n    This is more than sufficient to shift the burden to Defendant to show that there \nis admissible evidence demonstrating a genuine issue of material fact requiring a trial.  \nCelotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986) (Rule 56 does not require moving \nparty to “support its motion with affidavits or other similar materials negating the \nopponent’s claim”) (emphasis in original).3  As Judge Kennelly stated in Wilson:  \n                                                 \n3 Nor does offering Defendant’s evidence for review and evaluation in the context of the instant \nmotion, or treating it in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, constitute a waiver by the moving \nparty of any objections to the admissibility or weight to be accorded the evidence at trial. Indeed, the Court \nis required to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, so the moving party is \ncalled upon to do so as well. See, e.g., Wilson v. Sundstrand Corp., Nos. 99 C 6944, 99 C 6946, 2003 WL \n  6\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 79      Filed 06/29/2007     Page 7 of 11\nA party may properly seek summary judgment by essentially throwing  \nthe ball into the court of the party with the burden of proof. See Celotex Corp. \nv. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324 (1986).  When such a motion is made, the non- \nmoving party bearing the burden of proof on the particular issue must “go  \nbeyond the pleadings and by [its] own affidavits, or by the ‘depositions, answers  \nto interrogatories, and admissions on file,’ designate ‘specific facts showing  \nthat there is a genuine issue for trial.” Wilson, 2003 WL 21961359, at *4   \n(emphasis supplied). \n \n \nAccordingly, all of Defendant’s arguments that depend upon the “failures” in Plaintiff’s \nmotion miss the mark. Id. \nUltimately, the Court must determine whether a reasonable trier of fact could \nconclude that the party with the burden of proof—here, the Defendant—has presented \nsufficient evidence which, if believed, would, under applicable law, entitle that party to \nprevail on those defenses.  Id.  Defendant has failed to meet this burden. \nb.  Defendant’s Has Not Proffered Affidavits or Other Admissible \nEvidence That, If Credited, Would Establish A Fundamental \nAlteration or Inequitable Burden Defense. \n \nThis is a single-plaintiff case.  David Grooms seeks a determination that the \nreduction of his benefits when he turned twenty-one violates the integration mandate of \nAmericans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act, as interpreted by the Seventh \nCircuit in Radaszewski v. Maram, 383 F.3d 599 (7th Cir. 2004). He also seeks an \ninjunction requiring the Defendant to pay him benefits sufficient to care for him \nadequately in his home.  Plaintiff has sought no relief for any other person, nor has \nPlaintiff even claimed that there are many others whose conditions and situations are \nsufficiently similar to his own as to require the same relief.  \n                                                                                                                                                 \n21961359, at *1 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 18, 2003) (“[I]t is not at all improper, nor is it uncommon, for a [moving \nparty] to base a summary judgment on the [nonmoving party’s] view of the evidence. Doing so does not \nrequire the [moving party] to concede the evidence’s admissibility or to concede for purposes of trial the \ntruth of any of the [nonmoving party’s] contentions.”).  \n  7\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 79      Filed 06/29/2007     Page 8 of 11\n Defendant, however, has claimed that providing Plaintiff with the relief he seeks \nwill necessarily fundamentally alter the State’s Medicaid program.  The Menenberg \nReport suggests that it will do so because the State will have to lift the Service Cost \nMaximum (SCM) (also called the “cap”) on benefits to every person who asks, at \ndevastating cost to the State.  Yet David has asked for no such thing.  Moreover, even if \nExceptional Care Rate caps were eliminated, and SCMs were lifted for everyone, the \nMenenberg Report does not support a conclusion of fundamental alteration due to cost.  It \ndoes not even address the impact of applying the requirements of cost neutrality and \nmedical necessity on his predicted flood of requests, much less demonstrate how the costs \nwould be incurred notwithstanding required proof of medical necessity and cost \nneutrality. \nAbsent analysis of those mandatory factors, the Menenberg Report does not \nconstitute evidence that the State will incur massive costs if David prevails, and thus does \nnot suffice to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact warranting a trial. \nAccordingly, it is incumbent upon Defendant to demonstrate that there is other \nadmissible evidence to prove that relief to David will result in crippling massive benefit \npayments to others. There is no such evidence. \nDefendant has offered no affidavit from any State official asserting that the State \nwill lift, or not enforce, the SCMs of all others if David prevails (a premise of the \nMenenberg Report that lacks any foundation). Nor has Defendant offered an affidavit of a \nState official declaring either: 1) that in the absence of a cap the State will ignore the \nrequirements of cost neutrality and medical necessity in every case or 2) that every \nrecipient who seeks additional benefits will be able to establish that the services he or \n  8\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 79      Filed 06/29/2007     Page 9 of 11\nseeks are medically necessary at a level equivalent to David’s (whose condition is alleged \nto be complex and extreme), and that such increased benefits will be cost-neutral to the \nState when contrasted with the appropriate institutional setting for that individual. See \nRadaszewski, 383 F.3d at 602. \nMoreover, because David is seeking relief based on a violation of the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act, relief to him could form a basis for changes in the State’s programs \nonly to the extent that those programs currently result in benefit levels to others that are \nin violation of those laws.  Nothing in the Defendant’s evidence suggests that Defendant \nbelieves, much less has evidence to prove, that many other Medicaid recipients are being \nunderserved at a level that violates federal anti-discrimination laws. \n    What Defendant has offered is, at best, a promise to come up with something at \ntrial. He offers the Affidavit of Barbara Ginder, Bureau Chief for the Bureau of Inter-\nAgency Coordination, Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS). \n(Def’s Resp. to Pl.’s Mot. Ex. C).  Attaching a true copy of the current Persons with \nDisabilities Waiver, Ms. Ginder’s affidavit simply states: “[I]f called to testify at trial, I \nam competent to testify regarding the PWD Waiver provisions, and whether any material \nchanges in the PWD Waiver would constitute fundamental alterations of the PWD \nwaiver.”  Ms. Ginder’s affidavit does not even state what side she would come out on \nregarding fundamental alteration were she called to testify, much less set forth the \nsubstance of such testimony. The affidavit is worthless to demonstrate the existence of a \nmaterial factual dispute.4  \n                                                 \n4 Moreover, to the extent Ms. Ginder would address only how the Waiver itself would be “fundamentally \naltered,” as suggested by Defendant’s Amended Answers to Plaintiff’s First Set of Interrogatories (see p. \n15), this would be insufficient as a matter of law to constitute an affirmative defense. As Judge McDade \nopined in Sidell v. Maram, No. 05-CV-01001, at *20 (C.D. Ill 2007), the State controls which boxes are \n  9\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 79      Filed 06/29/2007     Page 10 of 11\n  Nor do the other “evidentiary pieces” invoked but not detailed by Defendant—\nMr. Werner’s documents contained in Exhibits A and B and  Menenberg’s Rebuttal \nReport—demonstrate a genuine issue for trial (Def’s Resp. to Pl.’s Mot. 13).  Defendant \ndoes not explain how they address the fatal flaw pointed out in Plaintiff’s motion—the \nimpact of applying the requirements of cost neutrality and medical necessity on the \npredicted flood of claims.   Nowhere in these exhibits do witnesses explain how relief to \nDavid Grooms in this single-plaintiff case, which could come only as a result of this \nCourt having determined that David’s benefit level otherwise violates his rights under the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act, would require the State to abandon its program with regard \nto everyone else.   Federal law requires the state Medicaid agency to certify that it will \nrefuse to provide benefits that are not cost-neutral relative to the appropriate level of \ninstitutional care. Even more significant, Medicaid benefits are payable only when \nmedically necessary.  Absent a showing that payment to “all other persons” (Def’s Am. \nAnswers to Pl.’s Interrogs. at p.14) would meet these the tests of cost neutrality and \nmedical necessity, Defendant’s cost projections are completely unsubstantiated and are \ntherefore insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment.5  \n  Rule 56  “mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for \ndiscovery and upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to \n                                                                                                                                                 \nchecked off in the waiver application. Medicaid offers other choices right on the form. Defendant’s \nselection of “nursing facility” as the only comparable institution, and its failure to check the  “private duty \nnursing” box, are clearly not actions that are fundamental to the program, since other choices are offered in \nthe Medicaid program itself.    \n5 To the extent that Defendant still maintains that it is a fundamental alteration to the State’s Medicaid \nprogram to have to modify its application to include hospitals as comparable institutions to the PWD \nwaiver, this has been rejected by Sidell as a matter of law and should be rejected here. Of course, once the \napplication is amended, or modified for certain individuals such as Plaintiff, Defendant would not have to \n“violate” the cost neutrality certification requirement because the cost of the appropriate comparable \ninstitution would easily exceed the cost of in-home nursing services. (Def’s Am. Answers to Pl.’s Interrogs. \n15, Ex. A).   \n  10\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 79      Filed 06/29/2007     Page 11 of 11\nestablish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case, and on which that \nparty will bear the burden of proof at trial.

Defendant has failed to \nmake a sufficient showing as to an essential element of his defense: that the State will \nincur massive costs in its Medicaid program if Plaintiff were to prevail in this single-\nplaintiff case.

They are\nAs will be detailed below, these cost projections are not just\nunsound research\nmisleading in the extreme since they were derived by\nthe Medicaid\nmethodologies and based on invalid assumptions regarding\nprogram.\nMr. Menenberg was asked to examine two potential Medicaid populations: (1)\nirrnt fcr'iIitv rsidAnts who ootentiallv would move from skilled nursing facilities\nthe Persons\n(SNFs) to community-based settings and receive services through\nwith Disabilities (PWD) waiver program: and (2) current PWD waiver recipients\nwho use services at a cost less than their \"Service Cost Maximum\" (SCM).\nGroup 1--Current SNF Residents\nPRflRLEM 1: The Menenberci Report uses an incorrect extrapolation\nbound cost projections.\nprOCeSS that quintuples the potential upper\nThe Menenberg report used the federally mandated, periodic census of SNF\n- I. lr('\\\npatients, tile Minimum uata- iVIU) dSSIIItIIL, 4L-..- IIIUUIIIIIL L'.J\ndetermine how many current SNF residents could return to the community should\nthe Medicaid program entirely eliminate the SCM cost cap now in place. The\nhnicA of this data set to make that estimate is quite reasonable since it contains\nthree specific questions regarding SNF residents' desire and potential to return to\nthe community and is asked of every single SNF resident insured by Medicaid\nand/or Medicare.\nThe Menenberg team contends it has identified 1,100 PWD beneficiaries among\nthe 9,271 SNF residents who would leave SNF care and would increase state\nMedicaid costs by determining which residents: (1) stated they wanted to leave\ntheir SNF; (2) stated there was a person positive towards their discharge; and (3)\nwere expected to be discharged more than 90 days from the date oftheir\nparticipation in the MDS survey.\nThe MDS is a credible source for gathering that type of information as it is a\ncomprehensive census. However, a census is not a representative sample.It is a\nunder consideration is\nsurvey for which every member of a population\n-\nquestioned. As noted in the first chapter of undergraduatestatistics textbooks\nfrom a\n(Fox, 2003) a census is quite different from a sample.

Statistics are noted in research reports using English letters, so they will\nnot be confused with census data/population parameters.\nStandard research practice does not permit taking a nonrandom subset of a\ncensus and treating it as if it were a sample. Thus, extrapolating the responses\nfrom the subset of the surveyed population that answered questions of interest to\nII Lici\nsurvey riuiiiespui iuei IL vvi tu i lc1v ciuy LI V_.I y ''c\" I\nquestions but did not provide full information is a violation of the most\nfundamental rule in statistical analysis. Yet this is precisely what was done in the\nMenenberg Report. Only if Mr. Menenberg obtained a random sample of MDS\nrecords of sufficient size and representativeness, would he and his team have\nbeen justified in the extrapolation used to generate their cost projection.\nLL EI1 XpIdIII LI ie IuyI'..i,- u-;i .i-ii- it u+ uk  i kI 'I,drr L1i c',iridiu frI,cc4?.,+i. r,iiiiI.c., j+LhIIfL r,crfcn hcrc.  ,I I,r,Qt\nresearchers cannot pretend to be mind readers. They are not permitted to fill in\nmissing data for survey respondents in either a census or a sample. In fact,\nresponse rate is a standard criterion used by reviewers to determine the validity\nof a research report since it is understood that some amount of missing data is a\npart of virtually all research efforts. Whether a census or a sample, researchers\ncannot surmise how any respondents would answer a question even if their basis\nrfhr rrmrrhIc icfirrc htuIth\nIS SillIlidi ILIe III UIuIL'9Iopt ii_,o, ..n.I tI i .. +irit ru ,\nstatus, or any other factors that would appear to demonstrate comparability\nbetween the respondents and nonrespondents.

For instance, a researcher could sample a small fraction of 1% of the\n.\nentire U.S. population and make estimates about the U.S. population, (e.g., one\nin seven Americans are Latino) Or, a researcher could do a complete \"nose\ncount\" like the U.S. Census Bureau undertakes every ten years, and one would\nfully expect to obtfahin rthe same finding. But a researcher cannot survey every\nrf nr1 ciccIlmp thir rsnnnss wrnild hi th same as\nIOIAIIL 'I\na census taken of the entire country or that their responses would match up with\nthe findings from a random sample of all U.S. residents, even if the sample size\nwere far smaller. The every-other-state techrque could have perhaps 50% of all\nAmericans responding, but there is no way ot Knowing IT me peopie in me\nsurveyed states are different from those in the non-surveyed states. For instance,\n3\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 119-2      Filed 09/04/2007     Page 6 of 26\nif picked alphabetically and Alabama was included and Alaska omitted, the\nnational estimated count for Aleuts would be underestimated.\nOnly from a sufficiently sized random sample, where all members of a population\nunder study have an equal chance of being selected, can you draw conclusions\ndrw InfrnfiI\nana m- - a- ke-  esuuties iyuiuitiy uie pupuiiiui lILlill VVI lILl I IL;+ VV Lii cvvI I.

However, this is entirely different from guessing\nnonresrondents' answers in a census by proportionately extrapolating from\nrespondents who completed the part of the survey section under study. If you ask\nthe full population, estimation techniques are no longer needed, as there is\nnothing to estimate. Since you have asked everyone, you have the exact answer.\nYet violating this simple premise is precisely what Mr. Menenberg did. Here are\nhis words. \"...we observed that a number of the Medicaid nursing facility\nresidents under age 60 did not respond to all three questions.

These\nnonrespondents had answers to these questions assigned to them in the\naggregate by the Menenberg team. That is roughly four-fifths of the entire\npopulation of 9,271.\nWere the nonrespondents different fro,m the respondents?

Extrapolating from SNF patients verbal\nenough or otherwise capable of revealing their preferences to the nonresponding\ngroup, which surely comprised a larger proportion of patients with dementia and\nother more severely debilitating diagnoses, is absurd on its face and typifies the\ntype of selection bias that randomization and other sampling techniques are\ndccrird fr fnivri1 rinct\n\"—'—\nWe do not know why the questions were not answered by the respondents.\nHowever, the fact that four out of five respondents did not answer all three of the\npertinent questions tor this government-manciatecl data collection process is\ncurious indeed. Mr. Menenberg did not report on the nonresponse rate of other\n4\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 119-2      Filed 09/04/2007     Page 7 of 26\nMDS questions, so we do not know how many other sets of questions were not\nanswered fully by 80% of the respondents. But if this is a typical nonresponse\nrate, the well-regarded MDS data set would not hold the value it does for federal\nand state government quality control agencies and others who rely on its\naccuracy and completeness.\nThere also is a question as to whether Mr. Menenberg's team adhered to their\nown selection criteria. The Menenberg Report sought to exclude SNF patients\nwho were scheduled for discharge within the next 90 days. Yet 1,937 of 9,271\npatients in the universe under study indicated that their discharge date was\n\"uncertain\" by answering question Qic with a \"3\" (Bates number NAV 001342).\nStating that the discharge date was uncertain did not exclude these respondents\n,.— ,s ,,k i+ Itl IIrwid ftr irr'I..oirr in+cA,hr'\nIIUIII LI ie i VI I LI IJUjI I IL I.,JUIU I IQV cII'.Jvv'J I'JI II I.,ILli'.JI I F\"11\"''\nwere in fact going to be discharged within 90 days. This is not a trivial issue since\nwe know that nationally 68% of SNF patients are discharged within 90 days\n(Hendrickson and Reinhard, 2006).\nThis aspect of the analysis raises yet another methodological question. It calls\ninto question whether the final 216 cases overestimates the number of SNF\nwet, tic4 It,cr irtc++, t1trri t'r if fhc hrlc•a',f•i f•Q rkrtc frr t—rmmI tnih,_\nJJaLII IL VV RJ VVJL1IL1 V II ILILW.lJi ICAICACAI\nbased care was unlimited by SCM cost caps. As noted above, just 21 % of the\nentire group were designated as \"uncertain\" with respect to their anticipated date\nof discharge, yet 89% (193 of the 216) were categorized as \"uncertain\" since\nthey answered \"3\" to Question Qic (Bates pages HFS 9077, 9087, 9097, 9107,\n9113, NAV 1326). Just 23 (one-quarter of one percent) of the 9,271 potential\nSNF residents who could become PWD beneficiaries satisfied the Menenberg\nr;.—r—r-.+c fi.lki\nILilly.\nSurely, some of the \"uncertain\" group included SNF patients that would be\nleaving in 90 days or less, but it was unknown at the time to the survey taker.\nSince there were more than four times as many discharge time listed as\n\"uncertain\" in the 216, logic would point to a reduction in the number proposed in\nthe Menenberg Report, perhaps by a factor of 68% for reasons cited above.\nHere's what we know. All 9,271 SNF residents potentially eligible for the PWD\nwaiver were asked if they wanted to return to the community. At most 216 (2.4%)\nwant leave the SNF and believe that someone in the community was \"positive\ntowards\" taking them in.\nTwo-hundred-sixteen, not 1,100, is the absolute ceiling, and there is good reason\ntht\nf- ciinr't th 21A mv h rnnsidrhlv infl2ted As noted hove some\npatients may have been on their way out of SNF care already under the current\nrules since nearly nine out 10 fell into the \"uncertain\" discharge date category.\nWe also have no idea it the aiiege person positive towaras aiscnarge was\nprepared and capable to do what is necessary to complete the transfer of the\n5\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 119-2      Filed 09/04/2007     Page 8 of 26\npatient from the SNF to the community. No one from the Menenberg team\ninterviewed anyone to determine if this may have been wishful thinking on the\npart of some of these SNF residents.\nEvery single SNF patient who could potentially be eligible under the PWD waiver\nwas asKed, and me uoUit n-as r-n. er respon—se. i ri uppel uuuiiu iyuie u ui\nlikely less than that. Hence, the Menenberg Report estimate of the size (and\nestimated incremental added cost) of the group of potential PWD beneficiaries\nmust be reduced by more than 80%.\nProblem 2: Community care cost projections were derived from a skewed,\nsample, drawn by an invalid method.\nIn order to estimate the cost to serve current SNF residents who the Menenberg\nteam assumed would be opting for community-based care, they attempted to\nconstruct what is called a stratified sample with 28 cases. A stratified sample is a\ntype of sample that divides a population into designated subgroups in the same\nproportion that they exist in the larger population. In this study, the subgroups\nwere supposed to mirror the larger population of 216 with respect to their\n- r _cr-'_. :...\" I A rI \\\niimitauons OT ,-cuvi—ues ot uauy LIVIII /-wL) .eyuIIeb wIIk..II eive\nproxy to capture service need.

The Exceptional Care rate, as its name implies, is a\nhigher reimbursement rate required for the sickest 1% of SNF patients. Because\nthe MDS is a census, we know for certain that just 540 of the state's 47,624\ncurrent SNF patients qualify for this outlier rate category. (Bates NAV 639 and\n1293).

Those are the only\ncircumstances when Medicare pays full cost and that benefit is limited to a\nmaximum of 20 days. (Another 80 days is covered by Medicare for a partial\namount.)

MARAM, in his official capacity as Director \nof  the  Illinois  Department  of  Healthcare  and  Family  Services,  by  and  through  his \nattorney,  LISA  MADIGAN,  Attorney  General  of  Illinois,  and  hereby  responds  to \nPlaintiff’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, stating as follows: \nARGUMENT \nI.  THE COURT CANNOT ENTER JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF PLAINTIFF \nPURSUANT TO FED. R. CIV. P. 56 BECAUSE PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR \nPARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT PARTITIONS THE CLAIM CONTAINED \nIN EACH OF DEFENDANT’S AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES 1 AND 2. \n \n  The  Plaintiff  here  is  asking  for  a  judgment  without  specifying  which \nsubparagraph of Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 purports to authorize the court to render such a \njudgment.  See, Plaintiff’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment.  As Defendant will \nshow, no portion of Rule 56 empowers the court to award relief to Plaintiff in the form of \na judgment.  Additionally, the court should decline to treat Plaintiff’s Motion for Partial \nSummary Judgment as one seeking a pretrial adjudication on a certain limited issue \npursuant to Fed. Rule Civ. P. 16(c). \n  First, it is well settled that Rule 56 does not permit a court to enter a judgment on \nless than an entire claim.  Leonard v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 130 F.2d 535, 536-37 (7th \nCir.  1942)  (granting  of  summary  judgment  on  a  certain  element  of  a  claim  is  an \n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 76      Filed 06/20/2007     Page 2 of 15\ninterlocutory pretrial order in the nature of granting a motion to strike); Biggins v. Oltmer \nIron Works, 154 F.2d 214, 216, 217 (7th Cir. 1946) (Rule 56 does not contemplate a \nsummary  judgment  for  any  portion  of  a  single  claim  less  than  the  whole);  Capitol \nRecords, Inc. v. Progress Record Distributing, Inc., 106 F.R.D. 25, 28 (N.D. Ill. 1985).  \nThe rationale for this result is that Rule 56 refers to “judgments” which are, in turn, \ndefined as orders from which appeals lie.   \n  In  Biggins,  a  sales  representative  brought  suit  to  recover  compensation  for \nservices he rendered to defendant during a certain time period.  He sought to recover a \nsum certain which was broken down into five constituent items.  Plaintiff was awarded, \non his motion, a partial summary judgment on two items of his enumerated damages.  \nThe defendant appealed.  The Seventh Circuit found that the concept of partial summary \njudgment under those circumstances was both a misnomer and improper.  Biggins, 154 \nF.2d  216-17.  The Court found that the judgment improperly split Biggins’ single claim \n– to enforce compensation for services rendered – into separate and distinct elements.  Id. \nat 216.  The items of compensation were of “an evidentiary nature and in fact and reality \nwere mere elements on which a single claim was predicated.”  Id. \n  Both Biggins and Capitol Records demand the conclusion that the court cannot \nentertain this motion under Rule 56(a).  Both Plaintiff’s Statement of Material Facts and \nhis  Memorandum  in  Support  of  Plaintiff’s  Motion  for  Partial  Summary  Judgment \nmisstate the substance of Defendant’s affirmative defenses.  As disclosed to Plaintiff \nthrough discovery, both of Defendant’s affirmative defenses rest on more than the Expert \nWitness  Report  of  Todd  Menenberg,  the  Defendant’s  retained  expert.    Both  of  the \naffirmative defenses each consist of one claim that rests on three discrete evidentiary \nthreads.  (Defendant’s SAMF No. 20, 21; Defendant’s Exhibit A at pp. 9-22, B, C).  \nWere this court to award the relief Plaintiff seeks here, such relief would not dispose of \nthe entire claim contained in affirmative defenses 1 and 2.  \n  With regard to those affirmative defenses, Defendant asserts, on the one hand, \nthat if Plaintiff were to prevail and Defendant is required to ignore the costs caps of the \nPersons with Disabilities Medicaid Waiver Program, then the cost caps would have to be \neliminated for other persons, both those currently enrolled in the Persons with Disabilities \nMedicaid Waiver Program and persons currently in long term care facilities who could \n  2\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 76      Filed 06/20/2007     Page 3 of 15\nmove into the community under a more generous Medicaid Waiver Program.  Defendant \nasserts that such a removal of the program’s cost caps results in programmatic changes to \nthe  Persons  with  Disabilities  Medicaid  Waiver  Program  that  constitute  fundamental \nalterations (or result in inequitably harsh results to the State’s programs).  This assertion \nrests, in part, on the testimony of a fact witness, HFS employee Barbara Ginder, together \nwith the Persons with Disabilities Medicaid Waiver Program document approved by the \nfederal government.  (Defendant’s SAMF Nos. 20, 21, 22, 23; Defendant’s Exhibit C at \npp. Bates numbered 3025, 3027). \n  Next, Defendant asserts that the programmatic changes that result would require \nexpenditures of public funds that are not reasonable.  Two discrete evidentiary bases \nsupport this aspect of Defendant’s claim.  One basis is contained in the Expert Witness \nReport  of  Mr.  Menenberg  together  with  his  anticipated  in-court  testimony  and  his \nRebuttal Report.  (Plaintiff’s SMF No. 10; Defendant’s SAMF Nos. 20, 26).  The second \nevidentiary basis consists of the analysis performed by Defendant’s fact and opinion \nwitness, HFS employee, Matt Werner, together with his in-court testimony about the \ncosts to the Persons with Disabilities Medicaid Waiver Program were Plaintiff to prevail.  \nMr.  Werner’s  evidence  is  not  merely  cumulative  of  Mr.  Menenberg’s  since  the \nmethodologies used by these witnesses differ markedly.  Mr. Werner is also expected to \nopine  about  the  negative  impact  on  the  supply  of  registered  nurses  if  Plaintiff  is \nsuccessful.    (Defendant’s  SAMF  Nos.  21,  21;  Defendant’s  Exhibit  B  at  pp.  Bates \nnumbered HFS301460-301468, MW 500042-500053). \n  As shown above, Plaintiff’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment partitioned a \nsingle claim contained in each of Defendant’s affirmative defenses, and confined itself to \nseeking judgment on the evidence contained in Mr. Menenberg’s Expert Witness Report.  \nSee, Plaintiff’s Rule 56.1(a)(3) Statement of Material Facts and Memorandum in Support \nof  Plaintiff’s  Motion  for  Partial  Summary  Judgment.    It  is  evident  that  Plaintiff  is \nproceeding in a piecemeal fashion and seeking nothing more than a factual adjudication \non the Menenberg Expert Witness Report.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a) does not countenance \nthis result. \n  Second, the Plaintiff cannot rely on Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d) because this rule does \nnot permit the court to make a mere factual adjudication in the absence of a proper \n  3\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 76      Filed 06/20/2007     Page 4 of 15\nmotion for summary judgment having been denied in whole or in part.  Capitol Records, \n106  F.R.D.  at  29-30.    Defendant  adopts  all  the  arguments  and  authorities  set  forth \nconcerning Rule 56(a) as his argument here.  As stated, Biggins and Capitol Records hold \nthat Rule 56(d) cannot be used to grant judgment on an element of a single claim.  \nMoreover, the court should follow the rule articulated in Capitol Records that the court \ncan proceed to frame and narrow the triable issues pursuant to Rule 56(d), but only when \na proper motion for summary judgment has been denied in whole or in part, and the court \nalso finds that such an order would be helpful to the progress of the litigation.  Were the \nrule otherwise, parties would bring numerous and repetitive motions seeking to resolve \nlimited factual issues that would not dispose of a claim, would not become final until trial \nand would waste judicial resources in almost every case. Id. Since Plaintiff has not \nmoved for true summary judgment, he cannot ask this court to make a mere factual \nadjudication concerning the Menenberg Expert Witness Report pursuant to Rule 56(d). \n  Third, by its plain language, Rule 56(c) does not apply here.  Plaintiff’s Motion \nfor  Partial  Summary  Judgment  is  not  asking  for  an  interlocutory  order  concerning \nDefendant’s liability. \n  Fourth,  the  court  can  properly  deny  Plaintiff’s  Motion  for  Partial  Summary \nJudgment as an untimely motion to strike.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f); Leonard v. Socony-\nVacuum  Oil  Co.,  130  F.2d  535,  537  (7th  Cir.  1942);  Petroff  Trucking  Co,  Inc.  v. \nEnvirocon, Inc., 2006 WL 2938666 * 2 (Dist. Ct. S.D. Ill. October 13, 2006).  \n  Finally, for all the reasons set forth in Arguments II and III of this Response, the \ncourt should simply decline to treat Plaintiff’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as a \nrequest for a pretrial order pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(c). \nII.  WHETHER PLAINTIFF HAS PROPERLY INVOKED FED. R. CIV. P. 56 \nOR WHETHER PLAINTIFF IS SEEKING A PRETRIAL ORDER PURSUANT \nTO  FED.  R.  CIV.  P.  16(c),  PLAINTIFF’S  MOTION  IS  NOT  RIPE  FOR \nADJUDICATION BY THIS COURT. \n \n  Plaintiff’s Complaint sets forth three separate claims.  First, Plaintiff claims that \nDefendant violated the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, hereinafter \nreferred to as the “ADA.”  (Complaint at ¶¶ 4, 7, 37, 39, 40, 41 and 44).  Next, Plaintiff \nclaims that Defendant violated the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a), hereinafter \nreferred to as “Section 504.”  (Complaint at ¶¶ 4, 7, 37, 39, 40, 41 and 44).  Lastly, \n  4\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 76      Filed 06/20/2007     Page 5 of 15\nPlaintiff claims that Defendant violated rules promulgated by the Attorney General in \nreference to the ADA and by the Department of Health and Human Services in reference \nto Section 504, in particular, 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(d) and 41.51(d), referred to as “the \nintegration mandates.”  (Complaint at ¶¶ 38, 41 and 44). \n  According to the argument in the so-called Plaintiff’s Motion for Partial Summary \nJudgment, Plaintiff has abandoned his claims under the ADA and Section 504 and, \ninstead, pursues a claim that Defendant violated the integration mandates.  See, Plaintiff’s \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Partial Summary Judgment at pp. 1, 2.  Under \nthese rules, Sections 35.130(d) and 41.51(d), a public entity (or the program receiving \nfederal financial assistance) is required to administer services and programs in the most \nintegrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.  The \nSeventh Circuit’s decisions in Bruggeman v. Blagojevich, 324 F.3d 906, 912-13 (7th Cir. \n2003) and Radaszewski v. Maram, 383 F.3d 599 (7th Cir. 2004) do not recognize an \nindependent claim for relief under the integration mandates.  Both decisions reversed \ndismissals  of  ADA  and  Section  504  claims  and  remanded  the  cases  for  further \nproceedings. \n  First, Defendant disputes whether the integration mandates apply to Plaintiff.  \nAccording  to  the  Complaint,  and  to  the  information  that  is  available  to  Defendant, \nPlaintiff David Grooms has, at all times relevant, lived in the most integrated setting \nappropriate to his needs.  According to the information available to Defendant, David \nGrooms lives in his parents’ home in the community, participates in Defendants’ home \nand  community–based  Medicaid  services  program,  specifically,  the  Persons  with \nDisabilities Medicaid Waiver Program, and receives services through that program in the \nmost integrated setting appropriate to his needs.  Before the court need concern itself with \nwhether any relief to Plaintiff is justified and would cause fundamental alteration to \nDefendant’s Medicaid programs (or, cause inequitably harsh results), the court will have \nto first find that David Grooms has a claim under the integration mandates.  Since the so-\ncalled Plaintiff’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment does not seek relief on any of \nPlaintiff’s claims, Defendant need not now present any evidence that goes to the merits of \n  5\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 76      Filed 06/20/2007     Page 6 of 15\nPlaintiff’s claim under the integration mandates, or arguments of law concerning the \nrules’ meaning and applicability to Plaintiff.1 \n  Moreover, the Supreme Court in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 592-93, 598 \n(1999) did not decide whether the regulations promulgated under the ADA (and, by \nanalogy, under Section 504) exceed the Acts of Congress themselves, or were entitled to \nthe degree of deference described in Chevron, U.S.A. Inc. v. National Resource Defense \nCouncil, 467 U.S. 837 (1984), or simply “respect.”  The Seventh Circuit in Wisconsin \nCommunity Services, Inc. v. City of Milwaukee, 465 F.3d 737 (7th Cir. 2006) discussing \nthe “reasonable accommodation” rule promulgated by the Attorney General pursuant to \nthe ADA, noted that the Supreme Court never determined whether the rules are entitled \nto  Chevron-type  deference  and  the  Seventh  Circuit  did  not  so  hold.  Wisconsin \nCommunity Services, Id. at 751 n.10. \n  Thus, in addition to deciding whether Plaintiff has a claim under the pertinent \nrules, the court will also have to resolve arguments concerning the degree of deference to \naccord these rules, and indeed, whether the rules exceeded the authority granted by \nCongress.    Significantly,  Defendant’s  fourth  affirmative  defense  claims  that  the \nintegration mandates exceed the Acts of Congress, but since the so-called Plaintiff’s \nMotion for Partial Summary Judgment does not seek relief in reference to that affirmative \ndefense, those arguments are not properly made here. \n  As previously stated, Plaintiff has abandoned his claims under the ADA and \nSection 504.  Even if he has not, then his so-called Motion for Partial Summary Judgment \nis not ripe in light of the elements Plaintiff must first prove in reference to those statutes \n(and the integration mandates if such a claim is cognizable) before issues of whether the \nrelief results in a fundamental alteration to Defendant’s programs is properly before the \ncourt. \n                                                 \n1 Defendant is aware of the ruling in Fisher v. Oklahoma Health Care Authority, 335 F.3d \n1175, 1181 (10th Cir. 2003) that a person need not be institutionalized in order to sue under the \nADA’s integration mandate.  Defendant, here, is not suggesting that Plaintiff can sue only if he is \nin  an  institution;  rather,  Defendant  asserts  that  evidence  of  Plaintiff  Grooms’  successful \nparticipation in the Defendant’s program negates his claim under the integration mandates on the \nmerits.  In any event, as stated above, the Seventh Circuit has not recognized an independent \nclaim under these regulations and Defendant disputes that these rules create such an independent \nclaim. \n  6\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 76      Filed 06/20/2007     Page 7 of 15\n  Turning, first, to the ADA, Section 12132 provides in pertinent part that “. . . no \nqualified individual with  a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from \nparticipation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a \npublic entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.”  To establish a \nviolation  of  Title  II  of  the  ADA,  the  Plaintiff  must  show  that  1)  he  is  a  qualified \nindividual  with  a  disability,  2)  he  was  excluded  from  participation  in  or  otherwise \ndiscriminated against with regard to a public entity’s services, programs, or activities, and \n3) such an exclusion was by reason of his disability.  Sandison v. Michigan High School \nAthletic Ass’n., Inc., 64 F.3d 1026, 1036 (6th Cir. 1995). \n  Under Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), officials of the State of Georgia \nwere  found  to  have  violated  Title  II  of  the  ADA  by  failing  to  grant  a  reasonable \nmodification to the State’s Medicaid program in the form of placing institutionalized \npersons into existing and unfilled community-based services programs.  Olmstead, 527 \nU.S.  at  601-03.    Nevertheless,  the  Court  held  that  the  State  is  permitted  to  resist \nmodifications that entail fundamental alterations of the State’s services and programs.  Id. \n527 U.S. at 603-08. The Supreme Court pointed out that if placing one or two people in a \ncommunity-based services program is measured for reasonableness against the State’s \nentire health budget, then the State will never win on its fundamental alteration defense.  \nId.  at  603-04.    Sensibly  construed,  the  fundamental  alteration  component  of  the \nreasonable modifications regulation would allow the State to show that, in the allocation \nof available resources, immediate relief for the plaintiffs would be inequitable, given the \nresponsibility the State has undertaken for the care and treatment of a large and diverse \npopulation of persons with mental disabilities.  Id. at 604.   \n  Under  the  law  of  the  Seventh  Circuit,  the  public  entity’s  failure  to  grant  a \nreasonable  accommodation  is  a  theory  of  liability  separate  from  intentional \ndiscrimination.  Good Shepherd Manor Foundation, Inc. v. City of Momence, 323 F.3d \n557, 561-64 (7th Cir. 2003); Wisconsin Community Services, 465 F.3d at 753.  In this \nCircuit, a plaintiff pursuing a reasonable accommodation claim under Title II need not \nallege either disparate treatment or disparate impact. \n  Without waiving any objections to any evidence David Grooms may attempt to \nplace before the court and without waiving any motions in limine or motions to bar for \n  7\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 76      Filed 06/20/2007     Page 8 of 15\ndiscovery sanctions, Defendant only states that his burden of going forward and proving \nthe fundamental alteration defense will not arise until Plaintiff proves that he meets “. . . \nthe essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of services or the participation in \n[Defendant’s] programs with or without reasonable modifications to the rules policies or \npractices.”  Since Plaintiff is not moving for summary judgment on his ADA claim, \nDefendant need not present or discuss any evidence or legal argument as to whether \nDavid Grooms meets the statutory requirements of the ADA generally.  Olmstead, 527 \nU.S. at 603-08; Sandison v. Michigan High School Athletic Association, Inc., 64 F.3d \n1026, 1036-37 (6th Cir. 1995).  Until David Grooms goes forward and establishes his \nADA  claim,  any  questions  concerning  the  sufficiency  and  merits  of  Defendant’s \naffirmative defenses 1 and 2 are not properly before this court. \n  Turning, next, to Section 504, Section 504 provides in pertinent part that, “. . . \n[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability. . .shall, solely by reason of her or his \ndisability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected \nto discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. . .” \n29 U.S.C. § 794(a).  To establish a violation of Section 504, the Plaintiff must show that \n1) he is handicapped within the meaning of Section 504, 2) he is otherwise qualified for \nthe benefit or services sought, 3) he was denied the benefit solely by reason of his \nhandicap, and 4) the program providing the benefit or services received federal financial \nassistance.    Plummer  by  Plummer  v.  Branstad,  731  F.2d  574,  577  (8th  Cir.  1984); \nSandison, 64 F.3d at 1030-31. \n  In Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 301-08 (1985), the Supreme Court held \nthat meaningful access to Medicaid services for the disabled did not restrict the State’s \ndiscretion under federal Medicaid law to choose the proper amount, scope and duration \nlimitations on covered services.  The Court observed that Section 504 does not require \nthe State to alter the benefits offered under its Medicaid program simply to meet the \nreality that disabled persons have greater medical needs because, to conclude otherwise, \nwould be to find that the Rehabilitation Act requires that States view certain medical \nconditions as more important than others and more worthy of cure through government \nsubsidization.    Alexander,  469  U.S.  at  303-04.    The  Court  went  on  to  find  that \nTennessee’s limitation on hospital days covered by Medicaid does not offend Section 504 \n  8\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 76      Filed 06/20/2007     Page 9 of 15\nbecause the denial of benefits, even when left unmodified, was not linked in any way to \nthose plaintiffs’ particular disabilities.  Accord: Frances J. by Murphy v. Bradley, 1992 \nWL 390875 * 7 (N.D. Ill. 1992) vacated on other grounds 19 F.3d 337 (7th Cir. 1994) \n(elderly disabled who claimed that they did not receive enough in benefits under certain \nhome and community-based Medicaid waiver  program because of the program caps \nlinked to the assessment tool the State used to grant those benefits, failed to state a claim \nunder Section 504; plaintiffs were not deprived of meaningful access to the benefits \nbecause the Medicaid Act gives the states substantial discretion in defining the allocation \nof benefits). \n  In Alexander, the Supreme Court found a duty to accommodate in Section 504 \ngenerally when it explained that “under some circumstances, a ‘refusal to modify an \nexisting program might become unreasonable and discriminatory.’”   Alexander, 469 U.S. \nat 300 citing Southeastern Community College v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397, 413 (1979).  See, \nalso, Wisconsin Community Services, Inc. v. City of Milwaukee, 465 F.3d 737 746-48 (7th \nCir. 2006); Washington v. Indiana High Scholl Athletic Ass’n., Inc., 181 F.3d 840, 847-48 \n(7th Cir. 1999).  As a corollary, the Supreme Court found that the Alexander plaintiffs’ \nrequest  to  modify  the  Tennessee’s  Medicaid  program  by  removing  the  cap  on  the \nduration of hospital days covered “would be far from minimal” and well beyond the \naccommodations that were required under Davis.  Alexander, 469 U.S. at 308.  The Court \nalso noted that similar treatment would have to be accorded other groups.  Id.  The \nSupreme Court, thus, recognized that the equities permitted the State to resist the broad-\nbased distributive decision that would be required.  Id.  The Eighth Circuit has recognized \nthat for Section 504 purposes, accommodations are not reasonable if they impose undue \nfinancial burdens or if they require a fundamental alteration in the nature of the program.  \nTimothy H. v. Cedar Rapids Community School District, 178 F.3d 968, 972 (8th Cir. \n1999). \n  Without waiving any objections to any evidence David Grooms may attempt to \nplace before the court and without waiving any motions in limine or motions to bar for \ndiscovery sanctions, Defendant only states that his burden of going forward and proving \nthe fundamental alteration defense or the affirmative defense that the relief would be \ninequitable will not arise until Plaintiff proves that he is “. . . otherwise qualified for the \n  9\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 76      Filed 06/20/2007     Page 10 of 15\nbenefit or service sought.”  Under Alexander and Wisconsin Community Services, this \ninquiry  encompasses  the  propriety  of  the  modifications  David  Grooms  seeks  to  the \nDefendant’s program.   The answer to this question, in most cases, requires the district \ncourt to conduct an individualized inquiry and make appropriate findings of fact.  School \nBoard of Nassau County v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 287 (1987).  Since Plaintiff is not \nmoving for summary judgment on his Section 504 claim, Defendant need not present or \ndiscuss any evidence or legal argument as to whether David Grooms meets the statutory \nrequirements of Section 504 generally.  Arline, Id.; Sandison v. Michigan High School \nAthletic Association, Inc., 64 F.3d 1026, 1030-35 (6th Cir. 1995).  Until David Grooms \ngoes  forward  and  establishes  his  Section  504  claim,  any  questions  concerning  the \nsufficiency and merits of Defendant’s affirmative defenses 1 and 2 are not properly \nbefore this court.  See, Alexander, 469 U.S. at 603-08. \nIII.  ASSUMING  THAT  PLAINTIFF  HAS  PROPERLY  INVOKED  FED.  R. \nCIV. P. 56, PLAINTIFF HAS NOT MADE THE REQUISITE SHOWING  THAT \nTHERE IS NO GENUINE ISSUE AS TO ANY MATERIAL FACT AND THAT \nHE IS ENTITLED TO JUDGMENT ON THE MENENBERG EXPERT WITNESS \nREPORT AS A MATTER OF LAW.  \n \n   Summary judgment is appropriate when “the pleadings, depositions, answers to \ninterrogatories and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there \nis no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to \njudgment as a matter of law.  Schuster v. Lucent Technologies, Inc., 327 F.3d 569, 573 \n(7th Cir. 2003) (citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)).  When evaluating a motion for summary \njudgment, the court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving \nparty and makes all reasonable inferences in his or her favor.  See Haywood v. Lucent \nTechnologies, Inc., 323 F.3d 524, 529 (7th Cir. 2003).  The court accepts the nonmoving \nparty’s version of any disputed facts, but only if those facts are supported by relevant, \nadmissible evidence.  Bombard v. Ft. Wayne Newspapers, Inc., 92 F.3d 560, 562 (7th Cir. \n1996).  The moving party has the burden of demonstrating the absence of genuine issues \nof material fact for trial.  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).  If the \nmoving party meets this burden, the nonmoving party must set forth specific facts that \ndemonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact for trial.  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n56(c); Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324, 106 S. Ct. at 2553.  To successfully oppose the motion \n  10\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 76      Filed 06/20/2007     Page 11 of 15\nfor summary judgment, the nonmoving party cannot rest on the pleadings alone, but must \ndesignate specific facts in affidavits, depositions, answers to interrogatories or admissions \nthat establish that there is a genuine, triable issue.  Selan v. Kiley, 969 F.2d 560, 564 (7th \nCir. 1992). \n  Where, as here, a plaintiff uses a summary judgment motion to challenge the legal \nsufficiency of an affirmative defense on which the defendant bears the burden of proof at \ntrial, a plaintiff may satisfy its Rule 56 burden by showing that there is an absence of \nevidence to support an essential element of the non-moving party’s case.  F.D.I.C. v. \nGiammettei, 34 F.3d 51, 54-55 (2nd Cir. 1994); DiCola v. SwissRe Holding (North \nAmerica), Inc., 996 F.2d 30 (2nd Cir. 1993) (quoting Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325); Haywood, \nId. at p. 562.  The rationale is that where there is an absence of evidence to support an \nessential element of an affirmative defense, with respect to that affirmative defense there \ncan be no genuine issue as to any material fact because a complete failure of proof \nconcerning  an  essential  element  of  the  defendant’s  affirmative  defense  necessarily \nrenders all other facts immaterial.  Giammettei, Id., (quoting Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323).  A \nparty seeking summary judgment on a defendant’s affirmative defense is not required to \ncome up with evidence to disprove the affirmative defense.  Applying these principles to \nthe so-called Plaintiff’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment demands the conclusion \nthat  Plaintiff’s  Motion  is  ill-conceived,  fails  to  understand  Rule  56,  constitutes  an \nimproper use of Rule 56, and that the Motion must be denied. \n  First, the Plaintiff here has not met his burden under Celotex because he has not \nestablished that there is an absence of evidence on an essential element of Defendant’s \naffirmative defenses 1 and 2, or that Defendant’s proof on those affirmative defenses will \nfail.  Plaintiff, both as a matter of fact and as a matter of law, did the exact opposite.  \nAccording to Plaintiff’s Rule 56.1(a)(3) Statement of Material Facts and Memorandum in \nSupport of Plaintiff’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, the Plaintiff is simply \ndisputing  facts  and  conclusions  contained  in  Menenberg’s  evidence.    The  so-called \nPlaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment, in its entirety, is arguing that Plaintiff has a \nclaim  under  the  integration  mandates  and  that  some  undisclosed  and  unidentified \nevidence that he will someday attempt to put before the court will show that Menenberg’s \nExpert Witness Report is wrong.  See, Memorandum in Support of Motion for Partial \n  11\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 76      Filed 06/20/2007     Page 12 of 15\nSummary Judgment at pp. 6, 7, 8, 10.   Plaintiff called certain facts “undisputed” as Local \nRule 56.1(a)(3) requires him to do, and then went on to dispute those very facts himself \nthrough  his  Memorandum  in  Support  of  his  motion.    As  yet,  Plaintiff’s  purported \nevidence is not before the court and Defendant is not obligated under Rule 56 or Celotex \nto try and anticipate how Plaintiff will disprove what Defendant, by law, must prove.2 \nFurthermore, Plaintiff’s Rule 56.1(a)(3) Statement of Material Facts  cites the \nMenenberg Expert Witness Report as evidence supporting Plaintiff’s SMFs Nos. 11 and \n17 through 19.  Plaintiff has nowhere challenged the admissibility of this evidence and, \ninstead, relies on  Menenberg Expert Witness Report as evidence to support a so-called \nPlaintiff’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment.  As previously stated, Plaintiff, to \nprevail on a motion for summary judgment as to Defendant’s affirmative defenses 1 and \n2, must show that Defendant does not have evidence to support an essential element of \nhis claim.  Plaintiff has not done this; rather, Plaintiff argues that evidence that Plaintiff \nwill  put  on  at  trial  in  support  of  his  integration  mandates  claim  will  show  that \nMenenberg’s  evidence  is  wrong.    Plaintiff  is  simply  asking  the  court  to  reject  the \nconclusions contained in the Expert Witness Report for reasons that go entirely to the \nweight to accord it and not to its admissibility under Fed. R. Ev. 702, Daubert v. Merrell \nDow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993) and to cases applying Daubert.3 The \nPlaintiff’s use of Rule 56 in this fashion is not countenanced by Rule 56 itself and \nCelotex.    \n                                                 \n2 As previously stated, Defendant is not waiving any objections, motions in limine or \nmotions to bar Plaintiff’s evidence.  Nevertheless, the court should note that, in anticipation of the \ninformation that his retained expert would need, Defendant asked Plaintiff by interrogatory how \nPlaintiff wanted the Persons with Disabilities Medicaid Waiver Program modified.  Plaintiff \nrefused to supply an answer and now claims that Mr. Menenberg does not understand what \nPlaintiff wants out of this lawsuit.  “. . . Mr. Menenberg’s Report is based on a misapprehension \nof the relief that David is actually seeking in this case. . .”  See, Memorandum in Support of \nPlaintiff’s  Motion  for  Partial  Summary  Judgment  at  p.  6;  (Defendant’s  SAMF  No.  24; \nDefendant’s Exhibit D at Interrogatory 19, p. 18). \n3 Plaintiff waived a challenge to the admissibility of the Menenberg Expert Witness \nReport under Fed. Rule Ev. 702 and Daubert and its progeny.  A party cannot treat evidence as \nadmissible for Rule 56(e) purposes and then challenge its admissibility at trial because the whole \npurpose of summary judgment is to determine whether there is any material dispute of fact for \ntrial and the parties have the burden of identifying the evidence to facilitate that assessment.  \nMalec, Id., 191 F.R.D. at pp. 582-83. \n  12\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 76      Filed 06/20/2007     Page 13 of 15\nIn  addition,  Plaintiff’s  Local  Rule  56.1(a)(3)  Statement  of  Material  Facts  is \nrequired to set forth allegations of material facts that contain specific references to the \nexact pieces of the record that support the factual contention contained in the paragraph.  \nLocal Rule 56.1(a)(3); Malec v. Sanford, 191 F.R.D. 581, 583 (N.D. Ill. 2000).  It is \nimproper to cite to a Complaint as support for a Local Rule 56.1(a)(3) Statement of Facts.  \nNajieb v. Chrysler-Plymouth, 2002 WL 31906466 * 1 (N.D. Ill. December 31, 2002).  \nUnder these authorities, Plaintiff’s SMFs Nos. 3, 9 and 12 through 15 are improper and \nmust be disregarded, regardless of whether they are true statements of fact or conclusions \nof law. \n  Also, the portion of Plaintiff’s Memorandum in Support of his Motion for Partial \nSummary Judgment under the heading “Introduction and Factual Background,” at pages \n1 through 3, is replete with “facts” and argument that are not properly before this court \nand should be stricken.  The facts that are material to a resolution of this matter should \nhave  been  set  forth  with  proper  evidentiary  support  in  the  Plaintiff’s  Statement  of \nMaterial Fact with specific citations to evidence.  Malec, Id., 191 F.R.D. at p. 583. \n  Second, Defendant does not concede that Plaintiff has met his burden under Rule \n56 and Celotex.  Nevertheless, if he has, given that Defendant has the burden of proof on \nboth  affirmative  defenses  1  and  2,  the  Menenberg  Expert  Witness  Report  satisfies \nDefendant’s burden as the non-moving party to defeat summary judgment by establishing \nthat  there  are  genuine  issues  of  material  facts  on  Defendant’s  affirmative  defenses.  \nDefendant does not contend that the fundamental alteration defense can be broken down \ninto discrete elements that Defendant must prove like the statutory elements contained in \nthe ADA and Section 504.  Rather, as set forth in Argument I, even if the Menenberg \nExpert Witness Report is not enough to establish genuine issues of fact as to Defendant’s \naffirmative defenses, Defendant demonstrated that those affirmative defenses rest on \nevidentiary pieces that are not the subject of Plaintiff’s Motion for Partial Summary \nJudgment  including,  Mr.  Werner’s  documents  (Defendant’s  SAMF  Nos.  20,  21; \nDefendant’s  Exhibits  A,  B),  documents  that  will  be  admitted  through  Ms.  Ginder’s \ntestimony  (Defendant’s SAMF Nos. 20, 21, 22, 23 and Defendant’s Exhibit C), and Mr. \nMenenberg’s Rebuttal Report.  (Defendant’s SAMF No. 26; Defendant’s Exhibit F).  \nAlthough Plaintiff makes no mention in his Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, he \n  13\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 76      Filed 06/20/2007     Page 14 of 15\nretained an  expert to contest the Menenberg  Expert Witness Report.   (Defendant’s \nSAMF No. 25 and Defendant’s Exhibit E).  Defendant refers this court to Dr. Flint’s \nReport only for the purpose of this Response and, by so doing, does not concede that \nPlaintiff’s expert’s opinions are admissible under Fed. R. Ev. 104, 702 and Daubert v. \nMerrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993).  It is evident that Defendant’s \naffirmative defnses 1 and 2 are replete with genuine issues of material facts for trial. \n  In summary, under Rule 56 and Celotex, Defendant, as the non-moving party, is \nnot required to come forward with evidence to dispute “facts” on a claim that is not the \nsubject  of  a  motion  for  summary  judgment.    In  other  words,  all  of  the  Plaintiff’s \nchallenges to the Menenberg Expert Witness Report depend on facts or arguments that \nare part of the operative facts under his integration mandates claim, or under Dr. Flint’s \npurported expert opinions.  Plaintiff himself admits this.  See, Plaintiff’s Memorandum in \nSupport of Motion for Partial Summary Judgment at p. 2. (“When the erroneous legal \nassumptions are removed from the analysis, and the report is viewed in light of the relief \nDavid Grooms actually seeks, Defendant’s fundamental alteration and inequitable burden \ndefenses collapse.”)  Since Plaintiff’s claim under the integration mandates (or the ADA \nor Section 504) are not before this court on anyone’s motion for summary judgment, \nDefendant need not controvert nor address any facts and arguments that would establish \nPlaintiff’s right to relief under these statutes and regulations.  Rule 56; Celotex. \n  WHEREFORE, for the foregoing reasons, Defendant prays that: \n  1)   Plaintiff’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment be denied; and \n  2)   The  court  decline  to  treat  Plaintiff’s  Motion  for  Partial  Summary \nJudgment as a request for a pretrial order pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(c); and \n  3)  The court award Defendant the costs of responding to this Motion for \nPartial Summary Judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(g). \n \n  14\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 76      Filed 06/20/2007     Page 15 of 15\nRespectfully submitted, \n \nLISA MADIGAN \nAttorney General \nState of Illinois     \n     \n    By:  /s/Karen Konieczny________  \nKAREN KONIECZNY #1506277* \nJOHN E.

Marain\nExpert Report of Todd D. Menenberg /\nMarch19, 2007\nII. Background on the Illinois Medicaid\nProgram\nThe Illinois Department of Healthcare and\nFamily Services (HFS) is responsible for\nproviding health care coverage for adults and children who\nqualify for Medicaid, and for\nproviding Child Support Enforcement services to\nhelp ensure that Illinois children receive\nfinancial support from both\nparents. The Division of Medical Programs within HFS administers\nthe Medical Assistance Programs, which\nprovide health care coverage to low-income families\nlacking health insurance, children who are wards of the\nstate, low-income senior citizens,\nindividuals with disabilities, elderly in\nnursing facilities and people struggling with\ncatastrophic medical bills.\nillinois has a Medicaid State Plar\napproved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid\nServices (CMS) that specifies the healthcare\nservices available to all Medicaid eligible\nindividuals. In addition to services in the State\nPlan, illinois operates several Medicaid home-\nand Community-based (I-ICBS) \"waiver\"\nprograms. Medicaid HCBS waiver programs allow\nqualified individuals to receive care in their own home\nor other community setting as an\nalternative to a nursing facility or other institutional\nseffing. Individuals in a waiver program\nhave access to specifiedservjces that\nare not generally induded in Medicaid State Plans,\ninduding services such as homemaker, personal assistant, and\nhome delivered meals,\namong\nothers. In addition to these services, waiver\nrecipients are able to access Medicaid State Plan\nservices, such as physician visits, hospital\nstays, etc. For state waiver programs to be eligible for\nFederal matching funds, Federal regulations\nrequire that waiver programs be cost neutral, that\nis, services provided to waiver recipients must\ncost no more than services that would be\nprovided to the same individuals were they to be served in\ninstitutional settings.\nPhysically disabled persons in the Illinois Medicaid\nprogram who require a nursing\nfacility level of care generally receive services in\none of two ways: 1) care is provided in a\nnursing facility or similar type of institutional setting;\nor, 2) care is provided at home or in a\nPage 2\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 141-2      Filed 09/27/2007     Page 5 of 35\nGrooms v.

Maram\n-\nExpertReport of Todd D. Menenberg\nMarch 19,2007\nFollowing is a more detailed description of the MFTD Waiver\nand the Persons with\nDisabilities Waiver.\nMFTD Waiver\nThe MFTD Waiver is for individuals under\nage 21. To qualify for this waiver,\nindividuals must need a level of care\nequivalent to that provided in a skilled pediatric\nfacility\n(licensed as an ICF/MR) or a hospital. Participants in the\nwaiver program have a dollar limiton\nthe amount of services they can receive. This\nllniit, which applies to each waiver\nrecipient, is\nequal to 125% of the average per diem expenditure for\nhospital care in the previous fiscal year)\nApproximately 530 children participated in the MFTD Waiver\nduring the time period\nSeptember 1, 2003 through August 31, 2004.\nDuring that same period, it cost approximately $2\nmillion to provide waiver services and the EPSDT\nprogram spent an additional $49 million to\nprovide nursing services to children in the MFTI) Waiver.\nPersons with Disabilities Waiver\nThe Persons with Disabilities Waiver is for\nMedicaid-eligible individuals underage 60.\nTo qualify for this program, individuals\nmust need a level of care equivalent to that\nprovided in\na nursing facility. Participants in the waiver\nprogram also have a dollar limit, which is\ngenerally referred to as a Service Cost Maximum (SCM). The SCM\nlimits the cost of the service\nplan a waiver recipient can receive. The SCM is determined\nfor each waiver applicant by\nway\nof an assessment tool, referred to\nas the Determination of Need (DON). Higher DON\nscores\ngenerally correspond with higher SCMs. A service\nplan, which sets out the allowed waiver\nservices, is developed by DRS for each waiver\nrecipient. The service plans are tailored to the\nspecific medical conditions and needs of the\nrecipients. These service plans are designed to\n1The limit for ventilator dependent children is\nequal to the greater of: 1)125% of the average\nfor hospital care in the previous fiscal per diem expenditure\nyear, or 2)100% of the average per diem cost of the institution from which\nwere placed. they\nPage 4\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 141-2      Filed 09/27/2007     Page 7 of 35\nGrooms v. Maram\nExpert Report of Todd D. Menenberg\nMarch 19,2007\neconomically provide the necessary services within the\nrecipient's SCM. Approximately 20,000\nadults participated in the Persons with Disabilities\nWaiver during the time period October\n1,\n2003 through September 30, 2004.\nDuring that same period, it cost\napproximately $175 million\nto provide waiver services to\npersons in the Persons with Disabilities Waiver.\nIllinois Nursing Facilities\nThere are over 700 nursing facilities\nparticipating in the illinois Medicaid\nprogram. HFS\nreimburses nursing facilities on a\nper diem basis for days of care provided to Medicaid\nrecipients. The per diem rates vary by facility and\naveraged approximately $95 per day as of\nFall 2006, however, Illinois\nrecently revised its rate setting methodology for\nnursing facilities,\nwhich resulted in new\nper diem rates effective January 1, 2007.2 The\naverage of these new rates\nincreased to approximately $100\nper day.\nIII. Nature of the Dispute\nThe Plaintiff in this matter is David Grooms. I\nunderstand that David has\nquadriplegia\nand is ventilator dependent. David received\nservices through illinois' MFFD Waiver\nprogram\nuntil he reached age 21 in October 2005. I\nunderstand that through the MFED Waiver,David\nreceived nursing services at home from RNs and\nLPNs that cost approximately $16,000\nper\nmonth as well as respite care costing\napproximately $1,000 per month. Nursing services in the\nMFTI) Waiver are generally funded\nby EPSDT, which was described in Section H above.\nOnce David reached\nage 21, he was no longer eligible for the MFTD Waiver. In late\n2005, DRS developed a service plan for David under\nthe Persons with Disabilities Waiver. The\nPersons with Disabilities Waiver has different\n(lower) SCMievels (as a result of different cost\n2Prior to the rate setting change, nursing facilities could\nreceive \"exceptional care rates\" for servicesprovided to\ncertain individuals with special needs. The $95\nper day average rate does not indude consideration of individuals\nreceiving exceptional care rates. With the change in the rate\nsetting system, exceptional care rates were eliminated.\nPage 5\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 141-2      Filed 09/27/2007     Page 8 of 35\nGrooms v. Maram\n-\nExpertReport of Todd D. Menenberg\nMarch 19, 2007\nneutrality measures) than the MFTD Waiver. The service\nplan developed for David under the\nPersons with Disabilities Waiver contained\nfewer nursing hours than he hadreceived under the\nMFID Waiver. I understand that David has\nbeen receiving nursing services at thelevel\napproved by the service plan developed under the Persons\nwith Disabilities Waiver; however,\nDavid now seeks to receive his\n\"pre-age 21 levels of funding for home\nnursing services.\"5 These\nadditional requested nursing services would\nresult in the cost of David's services\nexceeding his\ncost limitation in the Persons with Disabilities\nWaiver.6\nIV. Scope of Work\nI was asked by counsel to HFS to\nquantify the economic impact on the cost of the State's\ncurrent Persons with Disabilities Waiver\nprogram, assuming David were to prevail on his\nrequest for additional home nursing services and other individuals\nwere then also able to access\nadditional waiver services. The two\npopulations I was asked to evaluate are:\nI) Current nursing facility residents who\npotentially would move from nursing\nfacilities to Community-based\nsettings and receive services through the Persons with\nDisabilities Waiver program; and,\n2) Current Persons with Disabilities Waiver\nrecipients who currently use services at a\ncost that is less than their SCM.\n3The cost neutrality comparison for the MFTD Waiver\nis based on the cost of hospital or skilled\nservices, whereas the comparison for the Persons with Disabilities pediatric facility\nWaiver is based on the cost of nursing facility\nservices.\n4The service plan contained, on\naverage, approximately 12 hours per day of RN / LPN services and\nhour per day of personal assistance. The total approximately I\ncost of the plan was $8,660, which is under the 30t4(based on an\nexceptional care rate) of $8,840 per month. Exceptional care rates\nare extended to waiver recipients on a case-by-case\nbasis when the recipient would have qualified for\nan exceptional care rate in a nursing facility.\n5Defendant's Amended Answer and Affirmative Defenses\n6 to Complaint, paragraph 45.B.\ncostsfor David's pre-21 services were\napproximately $17,000 per month, which is approximately twice the cost\nof his service plan ($8,660) under the Persons with\nDisabilities Waiver.\nPage 6\n\na.\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 141-2      Filed 09/27/2007     Page 9 of 35\n--\nGroomsv. Maram\nExpert Report of Todd D. Menenberg\nMarch 19,2007\nJf David prevails on his\nrequest for additional home nursing services, the\ncost of David's\ncare would exceed his cost limitation under the Persons\nwith Disabilities Waiver and would\nexceed the cost of his approved service\nplan for the waiver. Therefore, if Davidwere to prevail,\n• it is reasonable to believe that some current nursing facility residents\nthat have been unable to\naccess HCBS services through the Persons with Disabilities\nWaiver (because the cost of their\nhome-based service needs exceeded their\nSCM) would then be able to receive services\nthrough\nthe Persons with Disabilities Waiver.\nSimilarly, if David prevails, it is reasonable to believe\nthat\ncurrent Persons with Disabilities Waiver\nrecipients would likely access additional HCBS\nservices up to (and potentially in excessof) their SCMs.7\nThe process I used to evaluate the two\npopulations above and the results of\nmy analyses\nare explained in more detail in the following section.\nV. Process and Results\nMy colleagues and I had a series of discussions in\nearly 2007 with a number of State\npersonnel, induding attorneys and executives with HFSand DHS. Our work induded\ndiscussions with the following individuals:\n• Matt Werner —\nI-IFS,Bureau of Rate Development and\nAnalysis\n• Barbara Cinder —\nHFS,Bureau of Interagency Coordination\n• Kelly Cuningham -\nI-IFS,Bureau of Long Term Care\n• Nancy Becker —\nHFS,Bureau of Rate Development and\nAnalysis\n• Sue Coonrod —\nHFS,Bureau of Long Term Care\n• Ten Dederer —\nDHS,Division of Rthabjlitation Services\n• John Huston —\nOfficeof the Attorney General\n• Karen Koriieczny -\nOfficeof the Attorney General\n• Joseph Howard -\nI-IFS,Office of General Counsel\n7My analyses of nursing facility residents and individuals\nWaiver are not limited to individuals with currently served under thePersonswith Disabilities\nquadriplegia or that are ventilator dependent. If David\nwere to prevail in\nthis matter, individuals with various medical\nconditions (not only those with quadriplegiaor that are ventilator\ndependent) would likely access additional services.\nPage 7\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 141-2      Filed 09/27/2007     Page 10 of 35\nGrooms v. Marani\nExpert Report of Todd D. Menenberg\nMarch 19, 2007\nAs part of our discussions, we\nrequested and received information relevant to this\nmatter induding\n• Medicaid HCBS waiver documents\n• CMS 372 reports detailing HCBS waiver\nexpenditures\n•\nStatistical data on services and costs for individuals\nin the HCBS waiver\nprograms\n• Medicaid fee schedule for HCBS waiver services\n• Statewide nursing facility utilization statistics\n• Statewide nursing facility Medicaidper diem rate schedules\n• Summary MDS data for selected\nnursing facility residents\n•\nDavid's plan of care developed for the Persons\nwith Disabilities Waiver\n• Summary of the costs of David's services since\nOctober 2005\n• General description of the\nprocess used to develop service plans for HCBS\nwaiver recipients\nSelected depositions, pleadings, and courtrulings in this and related matters\nAfter our discussions with State\npersonnel and our review of the information listed\nabove, we were asked to specifically\nquantify the following:\n1) the cost for additional individuals that would\nmove from nursing facilities into the\ncommunity, who would access Medicaid services through the Persons\nwith\nDisabilities Waivex and,\n2) the additional cost for current Persons with Disabilities\nWaiver recipients that would\naccess additional HCBS services up to (and\npotentially in excess of) their SCMs.\nDue to the nature of this dispute, the elements\nneeded to analyze these costs indude\nfinancial, economic, and cost data, both historical and\nprojected. The framework basically\ncompares financial estimates of: (a) the cost of care for Medicaid\nrecipients under the current\nprograms, with (b) the estimated costs assuming changes to the\nprograms. I have been asked to\ntake various assumptions and data and\ndesign an appropriate cost model based on\nmy\nexperience and general practices of computing costs, which woulddetermine a reasonable\nPage 8\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 141-2      Filed 09/27/2007     Page 11 of 35\nGrooms v. Maram\nExpert Report of Todd D. Menenberg\nMarch 19,2007\nestimate of costs at issue in this matter. The\nrest of this report describes the\nprocess I have\nundertaken and the results of my analyses.\nCost to Move Nursing Facility Residents into the\nCommunity\nThe objective of this part of\nmy analysis was to estimate the additional cost related to\nnursing facility residents that would move from the\nnursing facility into the community and\naccess Medicaid services through the Persons with Disabilities\nWaiver, if there were no SCM\nlimitations.\nThis analysis relied on data from the\nSeptember 30, 2006 MDS databases used for\nnursing facility rate setting. We worked with HFS\npersonnel to identify Medicaid-eligible\nindividuals under age 60 in nursing facilities. There\nwere approximately 9,000 individuals\nmeeting these criteria. We then identified individuals that\nwere not scheduled to be discharged\nfrom the nursing facility in the next 90\ndays.9 From this group of individuals, we then\nidentified how many individuals had\nexpressed a desire to leave the nursing fadilitylo and hada\nsupport person \"positive towards\" their discharge from the\nnursing facility.\" 216 individuals\nmet all these criteria. Therefore, these individuals would\npotentially move from the nursing\nfacility to the community and be served under the Persons with\nDisabilities Waiver were the\nSCM limitations removed.\n8HFShasaccess to data from assessments of nursing facility residents. This data\nis commonly referred to as\nMinimum Data Set (MDS) information. Resident\nThe database used for our analysis included MDS ainssfeosrsmmaetinotns are completed periodically over the course ofa year.\nfor residents in nursing facilities on September\n30,\n2006. The MDS information was based on the most\nrecently completed assessment as of September 30, 2006. For\ncertain residents who had recently been admitted to a\nnursing facility (or for those in a hospital or otherwise\ntemporarily out of the nursing facility), there was a two week \"grace\nperiod\" to complete MDS assessments.\nMDS assessment instrument includes question Qic, which indicates\nwhether or not the resident is expected to\nbe discharged within 90 days.\n10The MDS assessment instrument indudes\nquestion QI a, which asks whether the resident desires to return to the\ncommunity.\nMDS assessment instrument indudes question QTh, which indicates\nwhether or not there is a person who is\n\"positive towards\" the resident's discharge from the nursing\nfacility.\nPage 9\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 141-2      Filed 09/27/2007     Page 12 of 35\nGrooms v. Maram\nExpert Report of Todd D. Menenberg\nMarch 19, 2007\nAs part of this process, we observed that\na number of the Medicaid nursing facility\nresidents under age 60 did not respond to all three\nquestions discussed above. Assuming that\nthese non-responding individuals would have\nanswered the three questions in a simiiarmanner\nas those who did\nrespondto all three questions, there would be a total of\napproximately 1,100\nMedicaid residents (induding the 216 individuals\nabove) under age 60 that were not scheduled\nto be discharged within the next 90 days, desired\nto return to the community, and had\na person\npositive towards their discharge. Therefore, for\npurposes of my analysis, I have determined\nthat approximately 1,100 current\nnursing facility residents would potentially move from\nnursing facilities into the community and be served under the Persons\nwith Disabilities Waiver\nwere the SCM limitations removed.\nWe sorted the MDS data for the 216 individuals\ndescribed above by their activities of\ndaily living (ADL) scores.'2 The ADL scores ranged from 7\nto 28. The largest group of\nindividuals had an ADL score of 7. From the 216 MDS\nassessments, 28 were judgmentally\nselected for detailed clinical review. The\nsample was selected with the goal of obtaining\nresidents whose ADL scores were distributed in\na similar fashion to the ADL scores of the 216\nidentified residents.\nThe table on the following\npage details the number of MDS assessments by ADL score\nand the number selected for review.\n'2The ADL score indicates the level of\nsupport needed to accomplish activities of daily living, such as\neating, bathing,\ngrooming, transfer, etc. Lower scores indicate less need for assistance and higher\nassistance. scores indicate greater need for\nPage 10\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 141-2      Filed 09/27/2007     Page 13 of 35\nGrooms v.

From the plan ofcare\nand the Medicaid fee schedule, we were able\nto estimate the cost to care for each individual in\nthe community.\nExhibit 1 shows the Medicaid rate paid for each of\nthe 28 individuals to the nursing\nfacility as of Fall 2006 and the current rate (effective\nJanuary 1, 2007), the estimated cost to care\nfor the individual in the community, and the\ndifference between the nursing facilityrates and\nthe estimated cost to care for the individual in\nthe community. The\naverage difference between\nthe nursing facility rate as of Fall 2006 and the\nestimated Cost to care for the individual in the\ncommunity is $79.94 per day. The difference using the\nJanuary 2007 nursing facility rates is\n$83.01 per day.\nAssuming that the 28 assessments are representative of the 216\nassessments, the\nadditional cost for all 216 assessments would be\napproximately $17,000 per day or\napproximately $6.3 million annually ($79.94 per day x 216 individuals\nx 365 days) using the Fall\n2006 nursing facility rates. A similar calculation\nbased on the January 2007 rates results inan\nadditional cost of approximately $6.5 million\nannually.\nAn extrapolation to account for the\nnon-response issue discussed above, results in an\nadditional annual cost for the\napproximately 1,100 individuals (induding the 216 individuals\nabove) of approximately $32 million using the Fall 2006\nrates or approximately $33 million\nusing the January 2007 rates.\nsupervisor for the DES Brain Injury waiver.

The\nmonthly cost information was provided in\n$100 increments. We have been asked to determine the\ndifference between the cost of the\nPersons with Disabilities Waiver recipients' service\nplans and their respective SCMs. We were\nalso asked to perform similar calculations\nassuming each SCM were increased by 10% and 20%.\nFinaiiy, we were asked to calculate the cost that would be incurred if each\nservice plan were\nincreased by 196%', which represents the difference between\nthe cost of services that David\nrequested and the cost of the service plan developed for David for the Persons\nwith Disabffities\nWaiver.\nThe results (see Exhibit 2 for calculations) of these\nanalyses indicate:\n• The difference between the cost of the Persons with Disabilities\nWaiver\nrecipients' service plans and their respective SCMs would be\napproximately $206\nmillion annually.\n• The difference between the cost of the Persons with\nDisabilities Waiver\nrecipients' service plans and their respective SCMs increased\nby 10% would be\napproximately $258 million annually.\n14The cost model is set up so thatsimilarcalculations can easily be done for varying\npercentages.\nPagel3\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 141-2      Filed 09/27/2007     Page 16 of 35\nGrooms v.

This analysis takes the amount of private duty nursing care that David\nGrooms\nreceived in Sfit Pizrd Jr (QT'V\\ )1Iñ fIL+I1i -Id.S,L. ii uiiii year 'avia was in.  the MI-I'D\nwaiver) and compares it to the average SFY cost for people in\nnursing homes and the\nHome Services Program (HSP). Since it is unclear exactly how\nmany individuals would\neventually receive services at David's level, this analysis reviewed the costs at several\nivcis. i UT CIICVC ills nigniy unliKely that more t—han 3-0 -% of- individuals would ever fall\ninto this category so the levels modeled are 1%, 10%, 20%, and\n30%. By modeling a\nlevel of 1% the analysis has the flexibility to test\nany level by multiplying the level of 1%\nby the level to model. For example, to model a 5%shiftone would multiply the value of\n1% by 5.\nHFS is frequently asked to analyze proposed legislative initiatives. and\npolicy changes\nwithout complete information in a very short time frcime WithruttK -c +;\n'JI LIJ11 UI\ncompleteinformation, such analyses usually take the form of modeling the maximumor\nminimum potential impacts of a change. This analysis follows thatapproach, since there\nare many interdependent variables that affect whether or not an individual can move out\ncf i-nrdn hrtyr\nI1_!1flZ•.\nRelevantPolicy Issues:\nPrivate duty nursing is provided to children in the MFTD waiver under Early Periodic\ncreenJng, Diagnosis, and I reatment (EPSDT), mandatory services under federal\nMedicaid law. For adults, those age 21 and older, private duty nursing is an optional\nfederal Medicaid service not included in the Illinois State Plan. The onlyway for an adult\nto access skilled nursing care in the home setting is to qualif' for services under a Home\nand Community Based Service waiver (HCBS waiver). Any nursing services for adults\nrendered outside the federally approved HCBS waiver are not eligible for federal\nfinancial participation (FFP).\nAll individuals in nursing facilities and HCBS waivers must have a Determination of\nNeed (DON) score of 29 in order for the State to reimburse for services. This is the\ncurrent tool used to determine the need for these services.

Some light-need\nnursing home residents could easily live outside a nursing home if 16 hours\nper day of\nnursing care were provided in the home. Nursing homes provide quality care in an\nefficient manner by capitalizing on economies of scale. That is, one nurse can care for\nseveral patients in a centralized setting. Shifting patients from\nnursing home settings to\nhome settings could have severe implications for the current medici1 cciztinrp\nand require a fundamental alteration of the\nprogram.\n1. More nurses would be required to provide home careas the care model becomes\nindividualized. -\n2. This would exacerbatethe current nnrc ch,-fr T,,. ,-1 ---i\nu.'. iiijacu uj1II1u comoinea1\nwith short supply would drive up wages. Wages would not stabilize untilmore\nnurses entered the market. This would likely take several years.\n3. Higher wages would drive up the cost of nursing home and private\nduty nursing\nai .\n4. Lower occupancy and higher wages would force some nursing homes to close.\nNursing homes are the only option for some individuals. The consolidation\nwould reduce access to this care in some areas.\n. Although it be desirable for individuals to receive 16 hours\nmay per day of\nprivate duty nursing care in their homes, it is not cost efficient.\nThe current medical assistance program in Illinois serves over 2 millinn nicn1ewh\nmonth. This consists of children, parents, pregnant women, disabled adults, and\nelderly.\nThe current program operates at a cost of over $10 billion annually. Without\nadjusting for\nthe upward pressure on wages, the shift of only 10% of the current\nnursing home\nnc)nI]latic)n tn hnm ciri reeivinc hr,ftc vI11L w÷,- i'aviu 'J100111S uuriiig in-c  'iast\nyear in the Medically Fragile-Technology Dependent (MFTD) waiver would costs and\nadditional $856million.That is more than the $578millionspent on all expanded eligible\npopulations in FY 2005.

This combined\n$1.52 billion shift is almost equal than the total amount of $1.8 billion spent on all\nchildren in the medical assistance program.\nSuch a large shift in costs would force the State to fundamentally alter the current\nprogram from one that takes care of a mix of uninsured families, disabled, and elderly to\none that only takes care of the neediest families and a small nonulation of the mrct\nseverely ill.\nFage2oI2\n301461\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 77      Filed 06/20/2007     Page 41 of 47\nF\\,d-,-1 r,11\niJala I dVICS\nHFS 301462\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 77      Filed 06/20/2007     Page 42 of 47\nM d\narch\\Projects\\ MFTD:\\Brda\\ResE  'erage. av equivali to MFTI ?nt ID  to hours e irect cat f curreni a number averag shift e or o equival entto MFT D ng urs benefit i n unity with comrr facility t( ) t curren Populati Shift on frc  G rooms. eq lent to Day id u iva hours tc direct ca re number r it rre Cu )f shift is Groon or eq Da id lent to iva u ing benefit flu rs Tiunity comi wiff ritfacility I •0 rrei Cu Populal fr Shift om ion  Sof Cosi Persc ns \n C\ns3rooms\\[Groori ases\\(  Shift 30%  Shift 20%  Shift 10%  1% 3hift  Shift 30%  Shift 20°A  Shift 10°A  Shift 1%  PM PD PM PM :S FTE  Month Mei mber bility Lial  Pg ufrom hfftii C \nlsion.xls}CaIc compai  cost  $ 1,6 35,189,394 $  1,1: $ a3,459,596 $  31729,798 5 $ $  $ 56,172,980 $  2,5 $ 68,438,867 $  1,7 $ '12,292,578 $  56,146,289 $ $  $ $ 85,614,629  $ $ 74 $ 224€ $ 57,13 685,57c 1, 54O,O86,62 $ $ ng Facility Nursi ExcNu i Wa(Disable rogram F tc Comrrent icilities \n1,6 0,017 $  3,345 i,oc $  6,672 5 $  54,667 $  74,644 4,2 $  49,763 2,8 $  1,4 24,881 $  42,488 $ I  $ 255 7,767 $  170 2,045 15, 82,898 $  Ve: Lit eptioi :cCare E, na! rursing Facility N  iver) gReceivin Nrilty mui with \n565,731 0,738,25 1,398 $ ;3 1  377,154 7,158, 932 $ 83 15  ,188,577 3,579,41 $ 46€ 8  8,858 ,61 357,94 2 $ 4€  92,488 ,1 8,938,4 $ 1,99 50 I  ,658 ,461 $ 1,321 33 12,625,6:  4,730,829 $ 66 6,312,8  6,473,083 1,2 $ 6 63 82  $ 12 58 356 4,8 $ 16 38,527 5 30 462,326 6,3 165 4,757,101 1€ 30,655,E $ 65 Other :e eptional Disab C lity rsing Faci   es.

INTRODUCTION AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n  This is an action brought by an individual pl aintiff under Title II of the Am ericans with \nDisabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §12132, and  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 \nU.S.C. § 794(a).  The Com plaint (attached hereto as Exhibit A) alleges a violation of the \n“integration mandate” as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court in Olmstead v. L.C. ex \nrel. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581, 592 (1999), which requires that  an agency “ ‘administer its services, \nprograms and activities in the m ost integrated setting appropriate to the needs of  qualified \nindividuals with disabilities.’ ”  \nDavid Grooms, the Plaintiff, is a Medicaid recipient who, according to his Complaint, has \nGlycogen Storage Disease.  Prior to his 21 st birthday, David received Me dicaid services in his \nhome pursuant to the Medically Fragile and Technology Dependent (“MFTD”) waiver program, \nat a cost of approxim ately $17,000, including $1,000 for respite services.  Upon turning 21, \nDavid “aged out” of that waiver and sought bene fits under the Illinois Home Services Program.  \n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 62      Filed 05/29/2007     Page 2 of 12\nThe State has elected to fund the Home Services Program through a Medicaid waiver, the Illinois \nPersons with Disabilities (“PWD”) waiver, which is operated by the Division of  Rehabilitation \nServices (“DRS”) of the Department of Human Services (“DHS”). On his 21st birthday, David’s \nbenefits were reduced by approximately one half, to $8,660.  \n Although  DHS operates the Hom e  Services  Program  and the PW D  waiver, the \nDepartment of Healthcare and Family Services (“HFS”) is the lead Medicaid agency for the State \nof Illinois.  42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(5).  David brought this action against Barry Maram  in his \nofficial capacity as Director of  HFS, to enjoin HFS from continuing to impose the rate cap that \nresulted in the reduction of his benefits when  he reached the age of 21.  That cap, called the \nService Cost Maximum (“SCM”), imposed by HFS, is based on a nursing f acility level of care \nfor all persons in the PWD waiver. \nFederal law requires that, as to every Medi caid recipient receiving services, only those \nservices that are necessary and appropriate m ay be paid for by the State with Medicaid funds.   \nSee 42 U.S.C. 1396.  Further, services provided in  the home pursuant to waiver programs must \nbe cost-neutral, i.e., the cost to the State m ust be equal to or less than the cost of  serving the \nrecipient in the institution that would provide  him or her the appropriate level of  care. See 42 \nC.F.R. § 441.302(e), Radaszewski v. Maram, 383 F. 3d. 599, 602 (7th Cir. 2004).   \nPursuant to the Seventh Circuit’s decision in Radaszewski, to prevail in this action, David \nwill be required to prove that the level of care  that he actually needs exceeds the level of care \nthat Defendant has selected (nursing facility care at the exceptional care rate), and that the cost of \nserving his actual needs in an appropriate institution would be greater than the costs of providing \nhis services in the home.   Once that is proven,  David claims, he will be entitled to be served in \nhis home at Medicaid expense pursuant to the ADA’s integration mandate.  \n  2\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 62      Filed 05/29/2007     Page 3 of 12\nThese are matters that David intends to prove at trial, at which time Defendant will have \nthe opportunity to present evidence to refute  David’s claims. David does not seek a ruling on \nthose issues by this motion, as he recognizes that they are disputed and will require a trial. \nIn addition to denying David’s allegations a nd denying that he is entitled to relief  based \non his claims, Defendant has inte rposed Affirmative Defenses that he claim s defeat David’s \naction even if David m akes the above showings.  ( See Defendant’s Amended Answer and \nAffirmative  Defenses  to Com plaint,  attached hereto as Exhibit B.) Def endant  claims  that \nproviding relief to David in this case would resu lt in a fundam ental alteration to the State’s \nMedicaid Program (Defendant’s Affirmative Defense No. 1)) and would be inequitable because \nit would result in an undue burden on the State’s re sources needed to meet its responsibilities to \nother persons (Affirmative Defense No. 2.). Pl aintiff's motion for partial sum mary judgment \naddresses these defenses only.   \nA motion for partial summary judgment is an appropriate vehicle for obtaining pre-trial \ndismissals of affirmative defenses. See Petroff Trucking Co, Inv. V. Envirocon, Inc.,  2006 WL \n293866 (S.D. IL 2006) (“District Courts within th e Seventh Circuit ‘routinely entertain motions \nfor partial summary judgment seeking the dismissal of affirmative defenses. Wildey v. Springs, \n1993 WL 350195 (N.D. Ill. 1993).’”). \n   Defendant has the burden of proof on his affirmative defenses.  Dole v. Chandler, 438 \nF. 3d 804 (7th Cir. 2006). As we show below, based on th e undisputed facts that are material to \nDefendant’s Affirmative Defenses 1 and 2, and th e applicable law, Defendant cannot m eet his \nburden of proof, and his affirm ative defenses should be dismissed with prejudice as a matter of \nlaw. \n \n  3\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 62      Filed 05/29/2007     Page 4 of 12\n \n \nII.    ARGUMENT \n \nTHERE IS NO MATERIAL DISPUTE OF FACT REGARDING \nDEFENDANT’S FUNDAMENTAL ALTERATION AND INEQUITABLE \nBURDEN AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES BASED ON COST, \nAND THEY SHOULD BE REJECTED AS A MATTER OF LAW \n \nDefendant cannot meet his burden to prove a fundamental alteration or inequitable \nburden defense based on costs to the State.  Defendant has asserted two affirmative defenses \nbased on cost. Defendant contends that, if awarded, the relief sought by David Grooms would, \nby reason of the resultant cost to the State of Illinois, result in a fundamental alteration to the \nState’s Medicaid Program (Affirmative Defense Number 1) and that it would be inequitable \nbecause it would constitute a burden on the State’s resources that would unfairly impact its \nduties to other citizens (Affirmative Defense Number 2). Defendant’s affirmative defenses \ncannot be sustained as a matter of law. \nDefendant appears to be claim ing that the relief David seeks would, if granted, have a \ntwo-fold impact:  first, that many current nursing facility residents would also seek to be served \nin the community and Defendant would be required to pay for their services in the community at \na significantly higher cost to HFS than the cost  of the services provided in their nursing hom e \nplacements; and second, that all of the current r ecipients of PWD waiver services in the hom e \nwould seek--and would receive-- services at a cost  to the State that exceeds their currently \napproved rate by the same amount (196%) that David Grooms’ approved rate would be increased \nwere he to prevail in this action. \n  4\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 62      Filed 05/29/2007     Page 5 of 12\nThe Menenberg Report \nIn support of his affirmative defenses, Defendant has disclosed the report of a purported \nexpert, Todd Menenberg. (“Men. Rept.,” attached  hereto as Exhibit C).  In his report, Mr. \nMenenberg described his assigned inquiry as follows: \n“I was asked by counsel to HFS to quantify the econom ic impact on the \ncost of the State’s current Persons with Disabilities W aiver program, assuming \nDavid were to prevail on his request for additional hom e services and then other \nindividuals were then also able to access additional home services.  The two \npopulations I was asked to evaluate are: \n1)  Current nursing f acility residents who potentially would m ove from \nnursing  facilities  to com munity-based  settings and receive services \nthrough the Persons with Disabilities Waiver program; and, \n2)  Current Persons with Disabilities Waiver recipients who currently use \nservices  at a cost that is  less  than their SCM   [Service Cost \nMaximum].”  \n(Men. Rpt. p. 6) (emphasis supplied). \nThe Report further states: \n  “[W]e were asked to specifically quantify the following: \n1)  the cost for additional individuals that [sic] would move from nursing \nfacilities into the com munity, who would access Medicaid facilities \nthough the Persons with Disabilities Waiver, and  \n2)  the  additional cost f or  current Persons with Disabilities W aiver \nrecipients that [sic] would access additional HCBS services up to (and \npotentially in excess of) their SCMs.” \n \n(Men. Rept. p. 8) \n \nAs to this second group, the Report stated that Menenberg was \n \n“asked to calculate the cost that w ould be incurred if each service plan \nwere increased by 196%, 1 which represents the difference between the \n                                                 \n1 Reading the report and its appendices, we think it is accurate to state that Mr. Menenberg meant to state \nthat the potential cost would be 196% of the current cost, not that it would be increased by 196%.  See \nMen. Rept. Exhibit 2. \n  5\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 62      Filed 05/29/2007     Page 6 of 12\ncost of services that David requested  and the cost of the service plan \ndeveloped for David for the Persons with Disabilities Waiver).” \n(Men. Rept. p. 8-9) \n \nMenenberg further states in his report regarding this group:  \n “[t]he objective of this part of m y analysis was to estim ate the potential \nadditional cost if the limitations imposed by the DRS utilization review \nand service plan developm ent process were elim inated and the Persons \nwith Disabilities Waiver recipients were able to receive services up to \ntheir SCMs, and beyond.” \n(Men. Rept. p. 8-9)  \nThe Report indicates that Menenberg calcu lated that Group 1, consisting of nursing \nfacility residents, would total approximately 1100 individuals.2  He concluded that the additional \ncost of serving this group in the com munity, when contrasted with their nursing hom e costs, \nwould be $33 million at January 2007 rates.  (Men. Rept. p. 12). \nFor Menenberg’s Group 2, current PW D waiver recipients, Menenberg concluded that \nthe “additional cost” to the State of serving them  in their homes at 196% of the cost of their \ncurrent service plans would be between $206 million and $310 million annually.  (Men. Rept. p. \n13). \nAs we demonstrate below, Mr. Menenberg’s Report is based on a misapprehension of the \nrelief that David is actually seeking in this  case, and its conclusions depend upon two legally \nerroneous assumptions.  When the erroneous legal assumptions are removed from the analysis, \nand  the report is viewed in  light  of the relief David Groom s  actually seeks, Defendant’s \nfundamental alteration and inequitable burden defenses collapse. \n \n                                                 \n2 Plaintiff disputes the accuracy of Menenberg’s calculation that 1100 current nursing facility residents \nwould seek to be served in the community.  However, for purposes of this motion and the analysis \ncontained herein, Plaintiff assumes that this number is correct. \n  6\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 62      Filed 05/29/2007     Page 7 of 12\nGroup 1:  Nursing Facility Residents \nAs noted above, Menenberg concludes that, if  David Grooms prevails in this case, 1100 \ncurrent nursing facility residents would be permitted to leave the nursing hom e to be served in \nthe community, at a rate higher than the rate Medicaid was paying the nursing facility, for a total \nincreased cost to the state of about $33 million.  This conclusion is fatally flawed. \nFirst, it necessarily presum es that David’s relief would include an injunction barring \nassessment of cost neutrality.  But David seeks  no such injunction, either for him self or for \nothers.  Rather, he seeks only that his current Service Cost Maximum, the  “cap,” which has been \narbitrarily based on nursing hom e level of care for  everyone regardless of need, be lifted if he \nproves that the actual level of care that he needs is  a greater than a nursing home level of care. \nThen, if and only if he demonstrates that the cost of th e home services he actually needs is less \nthan the cost of providing the sam e services and care he requires in the  appropriate institution, \ne.g. hospital, he would be entitled to r eceive those services in the hom e.  See, e.g., Sidell v. \nMaram, No. 05-1001, p. 13-14. (C.D. Ill May 14, 2007)(attached hereto as Exhibit D).3\n                                                 \n3  Contrary to the views espoused by Defendant, under the ADA cost neutrality is not assessed by resort to \nthe requirements of the particular waiver under which HFS elects to deliver services.  Thus, although the \nwaiver application by HFS in this case limited the waiver to nursing facility rates, as the Seventh Circuit \nin Radaszewski made clear, and the Sidell court reiterated, neither federal nor state law requires that a \nwaiver application for adult home services be limited to “nursing facility” rates:  “What mattered to the \nCourt in Radaszewski was cost.  Since the cost to the State of institutionalizing the disabled [person] \ncould be even more than the cost of in-home care, it did not matter that the State did not have an explicit \nwaiver program in place for ‘hospital level care.’”  Sidell v. Maram, No. 05-1001 (C.D. Ill., May 14, \n2007) at p. 15.   In Sidell, the State had argued that Gretchen Sidell did not “qualify” for the Adult \nDisabled Waiver Program because she was “actually seeking a waiver program for hospital level care \nreimbursement,” and  “Illinois does not offer a waiver program for Hospital level care.”  Id. The Court in \nSidell rejected this argument, (“the fact that Gretchen may require “hospital level care” does not mean \nthat she is ineligible for the HSP program”), and it should be rejected here. \n \n  7\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 62      Filed 05/29/2007     Page 8 of 12\nMenenberg’s conclusions assume that his Group 1 recipients would not be subject to the \nsame cost neutrality assessm ent that David is prepared to m eet.4  This assum ption is legally \nunsupportable.  Indeed, David acknowledges that  he himself cannot prevail without showing \ncost-  neutrality as to the appropriate instituti onal  level of   care with all needed services.   \nDefendant may not ignore cost neutrality either as to its selected 1,100 nursing home residents or \nas to David himself.  Accordingly, Defendant cannot base his defense on cost projections that do \nexactly that. \nWhat the Menenberg report leaves out is this :  If the appropriate level of  care for the \nnursing facility residents addressed in the Menenberg report is in fact a nursing facility, then for \neach and every person whose cost of care in the  home would exceed the cost of serving him  or \nher in the nursing facility, waiver services would appropriately be denied.  Only those who could \nbe served in the com munity at the same or lower cost as the cost of serving them  in a nursing \nfacility (regardless of the existence of a “cap”), i.e. in a cost-neutral m anner, would have to be \napproved for waiver services under  Radaszewski.  The “additional” cost to the State of serving \nthat group in the home would therefore be $0, not $33 million. \nIn sum, Menenberg’s conclusion that serving current nursing home residents in the home \nwould be required if David prevails in this  case, and would cost the state an additional $33 \nmillion, depends upon the State ignoring federal law by ignoring the cost neutrality requirement.  \nDavid Grooms does not seek, and this Court could not countenance, such a result. \n \n                                                 \n4 Alternatively, one could postulate that Defendant has asked Menenberg to assume that everyone in \nGroup 1 actually needs and can prove that they, too, actually need a higher level of care than they are \nreceiving, e.g. a hospital level of care. But nothing in the expert Report or in Defendant’s pleadings \nsuggest that Defendant believes that current nursing home residents are being inappropriately or \ninadequately served in the facilities in which they reside. \n  8\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 62      Filed 05/29/2007     Page 9 of 12\nGroup 2:  Current Persons with Disabilities (“PWD”) Waiver Recipients \nAs noted above, Menenberg estimates that, if the relief sought by David Groom s in this \naction were awarded, all of the current recipien ts of waiver services under the Persons with \nDisabilities Waiver would receive benefits at 196%  of their current benefits, thus subjecting the \nState to an additional cost of $258-310 m illion annually.   This contention also depends upon a \nlegally unfounded assumption, i.e. that relief  in this case would require the State to  abandon \n“utilization review” and the m edically necessary requirement of waiver services and would \nprovide services to everyone who asks without regard to actual individual need.5\nEven if, for purposes of his motion, Plaintiff assumes that every current recipient of PWD \nwaiver services would, after learning of a victory  for David in this case, apply for a higher level \nof services, lifting the SCM “cap” could not lawfully result in increased services for any of those \nindividuals unless the recipients proved what David is prepared to prove in this case.  That would \nbe that: \n1)  their actual level of need is higher than can be met by benefits provided under the \ncurrent cap on their benefits; and \n2)  the cost of meeting their actual level of  need is equal to or less than the cost of  \nproviding them the appropriate institutional level of care. \nThus, only if the Defendant jettisoned the “needs” assessment and medical necessity altogether, \ni.e. “utilization review,” and gave everyone whatever they asked for, would the financial horrors \nproclaimed in the Menenberg report conceivably occur. \n                                                 \n5 The factual premise of the analysis (that virtually all current recipients would seek to increase their \nbenefits, and would ask for nearly twice, i.e. 196% their current levels) is itself unsupported by any \nstudies or other foundation and thus should be rejected.  \n  9\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 62      Filed 05/29/2007     Page 10 of 12\nPlaintiff submits that the relief he seeks in this case would actually have little or no effect \non other current waiver recipients.  It is utterl y illogical to assume that anyone who is currently \nreceiving, without objection, benefits at a level  lower than their current SCM would, as a result \nof lifting a cap that has to date had no adverse  effect on him, suddenly seek a higher level of \nbenefits because David’s cap was enjoined. Mo reover, unless and until any additional benefits \napproved by the State as a result of such reque st exceeds the individual’s previous SCM, the \nlifting of the cap could not be the cause of the  “increase.”  Finally, even if a Group 2 recipient \nseeking an increase proved a level of need th at exceeds the rate previously paid for hom e \nservices, and even if that new rate exceeded his former SCM, the State would be obliged to deny \nhim the increase to the extent it was not cost-neutr al as to the appropriate institutional cost.    \nAccordingly, unless each and every current PW D waiver recipient actually needs and seeks  a \nlevel of care higher than a nursing facility level of care, the costs projected by Menenberg could \nnever materialize. \nIn sum, even if this court accepts Mr. Me nenberg’s assumption that all of the PW D \nwaiver recipients would seek to raise their level  of benefits to 196% of  their current levels, the \nconclusion that the State would incur the cost of paying benefits at that level as a result of David \nGroom prevailing in this lawsuit is legal error.  This is because the Report proceeds not only on \nthe unproven and illogical assum ption that all recipi ents would seek services that they do not \ncurrently receive, but, more important, on the assumption that the Defendant would in each and \nevery case pay benefits without regard to whethe r they were necessary and appropriate or cost-\nneutral, in violation of the law. \n \n \n  10\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 62      Filed 05/29/2007     Page 11 of 12\nIII.  CONCLUSION \nDefendant  has taken the situation of one  of  a tiny m inority  of the m ost  medically \ncomplex of recipients, equated his claim ed needs with the aspirations of every waiver recipient \nand many current nursing home recipients, and used that “equation” to deny David Groom s his \nmuch-needed services.  Defendant does not suggest  or believe that every recipient actually has \nthe same needs or needs as serious as those  of David. Nevertheless, to buttress his “sky is \nfalling” defense, Defendant assumes that, without a benefit cap, every recipient will ask for--and \nreceive-- the same level of benefits David seeks in this case, regardless of need. He can offer no \nevidence to support the assumption that they will ask, and—more important—no legal basis for \nassuming they would receive, those benefits. \nDavid Grooms does not seek the enjoining or abandonm ent of either the cost neutrality \nrequirement or the “utilization review” needs assessment and medical necessity requirement, but, \nto the contrary, intends to be held to his burde n of proof on those very issues. Likewise, should \nDavid Grooms prevail in this case and obtain the relief he seeks in this single-plaintiff case, other \nrecipients  seeking additional benefits base d  on the ADA would be subject to those sam e \nrequirements.  Defendant’s cost projections, which depend entirely on those critical requirements \nbeing ignored, must be rejected. Defendant ca nnot therefore meet his burden of proof on his \naffirmative defenses, and they must be rejected as a matter of law. \nWHEREFORE, for the foregoing reasons, Defe ndant’s Affirmative Defenses 1 and 2 \nshould be rejected as a matter of law and dismissed with prejudice. \n \n \n \n  11\n\nCase 1:06-cv-02211     Document 62      Filed 05/29/2007     Page 12 of 12\nRespectfully Submitted, \n \nKAREN I.
