    "summary": "<p>In 1988, a representative plaintiff filed a lawsuit against the Colorado Department of Social Services in the District Court of the City and County of Denver. The lawsuit was filed under (1) Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C §1396; (2) the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; and (3) § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (1988). The plaintiff alleged that the defendant granted home and community based services (HCBS) to the elderly, blind, physically disabled, and developmentally disabled but not to the mentally ill solely on the basis of their mental illness. The plaintiff sought an injunction, requiring the defendant to provide the HCBS benefits.</p><p>The trial court (Judge Edward E. Carelli) granted the plaintiff's motion for class certification and certified a class of all low income, mentally ill Colorado residents who qualify for skilled or intermediate care under Title XIX of the Social Security Act but who have been deprived of HCBS solely on the basis of their mental illness.</p><p>On August 23, 1990, the trial court held for the plaintiffs. The court found that the defendants had failed to provide the plaintiffs with the same HCBS program that was provided to elderly, blind, and physically-disabled persons. The court held that this failure did indeed violate the plaintiffs' rights under the federal and state Medicaid Acts, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The trial court subsequently entered an injunctive order requiring the defendants to provide HCBS benefits to the plaintiffs.</p><p>The defendants appealed the judgment to the Colorado court of appeals, although the Colorado supreme court granted the plaintiffs' writ of certiorari to the court of appeals. On April 20, 1992, the Colorado supreme court reversed the judgment of the trial court. However, the supreme court order was subsequently withdrawn upon a grant of rehearing. Then, on December 14, 1992, the judgment of the Colorado district court was affirmed by operation of law because the Colorado Supreme Court was equally divided.</p><p>The state petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for writ of certiorari, but the U.S. Supreme Court denied the petition on January 24, 1994. The case is now closed.</p><p></p>",

Justice LOHR, Justice QUINN, and \nJustice KIRSHBAUM favor affirmance of the judgment of the Denver District Court. Duc Van \nLe v. Ibarra, No. 88CV22641 (Aug. 23, 1990). Chief Justice ROVIRA, Justice ERICKSON, \nand Justice MULLARKEY favor reversal. Justice VOLLACK did not participate. \nAccordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed by operation of law because of an \nequally divided court. C.A.R. 35(e). \nORDER OF COURT \nUpon consideration of the Petitions for Rehearing filed in the above cause, and now being \nsufficiently advised in the premises, \nIT IS THIS DAY ORDERED that said Petitions for Rehearing shall be, and the same hereby \nis, DENIED. \nROVIRA, C.J., and ERICKSON and MULLARKEY, JJ., would grant the petitions. \nERICKSON, J., dissents to the denial of the Petitions for Rehearing. \nVOLLACK, J., does not participate. \n17*17 Justice ERICKSON dissenting to the denial of the petitions for rehearing: \nIn this class action, the trial court held that the respondents, administrators of state social \nservice programs, violated Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794 \n(1988) (section 504), and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution \n(Fourteenth Amendment) by failing to provide Duc Van Le and the members of the class of \nlow-income mentally ill persons (petitioners), with the same Home and Community-Based \nServices (HCBS) program that is provided to elderly, blind, and physically disabled persons. \n\nThe trial court entered an injunctive order that required the respondents to provide HCBS \nbenefits to the petitioners.[1] The respondents appealed the judgment of the trial court to the \ncourt of appeals and we granted certiorari before judgment. \nWe were equally divided on the resolution of the issues in this case and the judgment of the \ntrial court was affirmed by operation of law. See C.A.R. 35; People ex rel. Link v. Tucker, 96 \nColo. 273, 42 P.2d 472 (1934). As a result of the affirmance, the August 23, 1990 trial court \norder has become the controlling document in this case. The respondents filed petitions for \nrehearing, which are directed to the trial court's order. In my view, the trial court erred in \nordering the respondents to provide HCBS benefits to the petitioners so long as they \nprovided the same benefits to the elderly, blind, and physically disabled. The respondents \nare allowed to target Medicaid benefits to discrete groups of disabled individuals and the \ntargeting of Medicaid benefits under an HCBS waiver program does not violate the \nFourteenth Amendment.[2] The petition for rehearing submitted by the respondent Colorado \nDepartment of Social Services demonstrates that there were, and presently are, no funds \nappropriated or available for the HCBS services sought by the mentally ill in this case.[3] I \nwould therefore grant the respondents' petitions for rehearing. \n[1] The trial court's order provides:  \nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that plaintiff Duc Van Le and members of the class, as previously certified, are \nentitled to meaningful access to the same HCBS program services which are currently provided to the elderly, blind \nand physically disabled persons. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that: \n1. State defendants, their agents and employees are permanently enjoined from denying plaintiff and class members \nHCBS benefits solely on the basis that their primary diagnosis is mental illness. \n2. So long as state defendants provide HCBS benefits to elderly, blind and physically disabled persons, they shall \nprovide the same services for plaintiff and class members. \n[2] The imposition of liability on respondent Henry Solano, Director of the Colorado Department of Institutions, based \non his failure to provide HCBS services to mentally disabled persons was also affirmed by operation of law. Because \nI would resolve the section 504 and equal protection issues in favor of the respondents, I perceive no need to \naddress the liability of Solano. I note, however, that there is nothing in the record of this case which supports the trial \ncourt's conclusion that Solano or the Department of Institutions ever provided HCBS services to the elderly, blind, or \nphysically disabled. Therefore, I perceive no basis in either fact or law for the trial court's conclusion that Solano is \nliable to the petitioners or should be enjoined as ordered by the trial court. \n[3] In fiscal year 1989, the General Assembly appropriated approximately $450 million for Medicaid expenditures, an \namount representing 10% of the entire state budget. 1988 Colo.Sess.Laws, ch. 1, Part XXI, pp. 86, 91. In fiscal year \n1991, the amount of funds allocated to Medicaid increased to over $665 million, or almost 13% of the state budget. \n1990 Colo.Sess.Laws, ch. 1, Part XXI, pp. 83, 88. In the 1992 fiscal year, the amount appropriated to Medicaid \nexpenditures has increased to over $1.1 billion, or almost 18% of the entire state budget. 1991 Colo.Sess.

The sums made available under this section \nshall be used for making payments to States which have submitted, and had approved by the Secretary [of Health and Human \nServices], State plans for medical assistance. \n42 U.S.C. § 1396 (1988). The United States Supreme Court explained: \nMedicaid was established by Title XIX of the Social Security Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 343, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq. \nMedicaid is a joint state-federal funding program for medical assistance in which the Federal Government approves a state \nplan for the funding of medical services for the needy and then subsidizes a significant portion of the financial obligations the \nState has agreed to assume. Once a State voluntarily chooses to participate in Medicaid, the State must comply with the \nrequirements of Title XIX and applicable regulations. Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297, 301 (1980). \nAlexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 289 n.1 (1985); see also Geriatrics, Inc. v. Colorado Dep’t of Social Servs., 712 P.2d 1035, \n1040 (Colo.App.1985) (goal of Medicaid “is to provide services to program recipients to the same extent, or as nearly as \npossible, as those services are available to the general public”). \n \n2  Currently, Colorado has HCBS waivers to provide: (1) aged and disabled persons with case management, personal care, \nhomemaker, adult day care, respite, transportation, minor home modifications, and electronic monitoring and communications \n \ndevices; (2) mentally retarded and developmentally disabled persons with personal care, respite care, transportation, residential \nservices, case management, and habilitation services; (3) inappropriately placed developmentally disabled individuals with case \nmanagement, residential habilitation, transportation, day habilitation’ and respite; and (4) individuals diagnosed as having AIDS \n(Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) or ARC (AIDS–Related Complex) with case management, personal care/homemaker, \nadult day care, home health care, private duty nursing, and intensive supervision of foster care children with AIDS or ARC. 3 \nMedicare & Medicaid Guide (CCH) ¶ 14,625, at 6341. \n \n3  The federal reimbursement is referred to as a waiver because the federal government may waive three requirements applicable to \nother Medicaid programs: statewideness, comparability, and community income and resource rules. See 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(3) \n \n(1988). \n \n4  The statute states that the estimated average per capita expenditure under the HCBS program must “not exceed” the estimated \naverage per capita expenditure under the state plan for the same year if the waiver had not been granted. 42 U.S.C. § \n \n1396n(c)(2)(D). \n \n5  The services provided under the existing HCBS programs include: home health care; personal hygiene; dressing; preparation of \nmeals; nonmedical transportation; home modification and monitoring; case management; adult day care; and instruction in self \n \ncare, independent living, and nutrition. \n \n6  The legislative purposes of the Home and Community-based Services for Mentally Ill Persons and Persons with Developmental \nDisabilities Act were as follows: \n \n(1) The general assembly hereby finds and declares that it is the purpose of this article to provide services for the \ndevelopmentally disabled and the mentally ill which would foster the following goals: \n(a) To maintain eligible persons in the most appropriate settings possible and to minimize admissions to institutions; \n(b) To recognize the unique services requirements of the mentally ill and the developmentally disabled; \n(c) To provide optimum accessibility to various important social, habilitative, remedial, residential, and health services that \nare available to assist in maintaining eligible persons in the least restrictive settings; \n(d) To provide that eligible persons who have the capacity to remain outside an institutional setting have access to appropriate \nsocial, habilitative, remedial, residential, and health services, without which institutionalization would be necessary; \n(e) To provide the most efficient and effective use of funds in the delivery of these social, habilitative, remedial, residential, \nand health services to eligible persons; \n(f) To coordinate, integrate, and link these social, habilitative, remedial, residential, and health services into existing \n  14 \n \n\nLe v. Ibarra, Not Reported in P.2d (1992)   \n \ncommunity-based service delivery systems for the developmentally disabled and the mentally ill, to avoid unnecessary and \nexpensive duplication of services; \n(g) To allow the state substantial flexibility in organizing and administering the delivery of social, habilitative, remedial, \nresidential, and health services to eligible citizens. \n§ 26–4.5–202(1), 11B C.R.S. (1989). \n \n7  The respondents in this case drafted the repealing legislation. \n \n \n8  However, the Medicaid limitation for the twenty-one to sixty-five year old age group does not apply to individuals institutionalized \nin other facilities. \n \n \n9  45 C.F.R. § 84.4 provides, in relevant part: \n(a) General. No qualified handicapped person shall, on the basis of handicap, be excluded from participation in, be denied the \n \nbenefits of, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity which receives or benefits from Federal \nfinancial assistance. \n(b) Discriminatory actions prohibited. (1) A recipient, in providing any aid, benefit, or service, may not, directly or through \ncontractual, licensing, or other arrangements, on the basis of handicap: \n(i) Deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service; \n(ii) Afford a qualified handicapped person an opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is \nnot equal to that afforded others; \n(iii) Provide a qualified handicapped person with an aid, benefit, or service that is not as effective as that provided to others; \n(iv) Provide different or separate aid, benefits, or services to handicapped persons or to any class of handicapped persons \nunless such action is necessary to provide qualified handicapped persons with aid, benefits, or services that are as effective as \nthose provided to others; \n(v) Aid or perpetuate discrimination against a qualified handicapped person by providing significant assistance to an agency, \norganization, or person that discriminates on the basis of handicap in providing any aid, benefit, or service to beneficiaries of \nthe recipients program; \n.... \n(vii) Otherwise limit a qualified handicapped person in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity \nenjoyed by others receiving an aid, benefit or service. \n(2) For purposes of this part, aids, benefits, and services, to be equally effective, are not required to produce the identical \nresult or level of achievement for handicapped and nonhandicapped persons, but must afford handicapped persons equal \nopportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement, in the most \nintegrated setting appropriate to the person’s needs. \n(3) Despite the existence of separate or different programs or activities provided in accordance with this part, a recipient may \nnot deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to participate in such programs or activities that are not separate or \ndifferent. \n(4) A recipient may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration (i) \nthat have the effect of subjecting qualified handicapped persons to discrimination on the basis of handicap, (ii) that have the \npurpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the recipient’s program with \nrespect to handicapped persons, or (iii) that perpetuate the discrimination of another recipient if both recipients are subject to \ncommon administrative control or are agencies of the same State. \n \n10  The trial court rejected respondent Henry Solano’s contention that he was not responsible for providing HCBS benefits to mentally \nill persons. \n \n \n11  Section 1915(c)(3) of the Social Security Act provides in part: \nA waiver granted under this subsection may include a waiver of the requirements of section 1396a(a)(1) of this title (relating \n \nto statewideness ), section 1396a(a)(10)(B) of this title (relating to comparability ), and section 1396a(a)(10)(C)(i)(III) of this \ntitle (relating to income and resource rules applicable in the community ). \n42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(3) (emphasis added). \n \n12  Section 1915(c)(1) of the Act provided: \nThe Secretary may by waiver provide that a State plan approved under this subchapter may include as “medical assistance” \n \nunder such plan payment for part or all of the cost of home and community-based services (other than room and board) \napproved by the Secretary which are provided pursuant to a written plan of care to individuals with respect to whom there has \nbeen a determination that but for the provision of such services the individuals would require the level of care provided in a \nhospital or a nursing facility or intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded the cost of which could be reimbursed \nunder the State plan. \n42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(1). \n \n13  Section 1915(c)(7)(A) of the Act provides: \nIn making estimates under paragraph (2)(D) [relating to cost effectiveness] in the case of a waiver that applies only to \n \n  15 \n \n\nLe v. Ibarra, Not Reported in P.2d (1992)   \n \nindividuals with a particular illness or condition who are inpatients in, or who would require the level of care provided in, \nhospitals, nursing facilities, or intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded, the State may determine the average per \ncapita expenditure that would have been made in a fiscal year for those individuals under the State plan separately from the \nexpenditures for other individuals who are inpatients in, or who would require the level of care provided in, those respective \nfacilities. \n42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(7)(A). \n \n14  The General Assembly has defined a “mentally ill person” as “a person with a substantial disorder of the cognitive, volitional, or \nemotional processes that grossly impairs judgment or capacity to recognize reality or to control behavior.” § 27–10–102(7), 11B \n \nC.R.S. (1989). \n \n15  Paralyzed Veterans held that section 504 “applies only to those commercial airlines receiving direct federal subsidies.” Tallarico v. \nTransWorld Airlines, 881 F.2d 566, 570 (8th Cir.1989). Concerned about the practical effect on handicapped air travelers, \n \n“Congress  amended  the  Federal  Aviation  Act  of  1958  to  specifically  prohibit  discrimination  against  otherwise  qualified \nhandicapped individuals.”  Id.; Anderson v. U.S. Air, Inc., 818 F.2d 49, 53 (D.C.Cir.1987); see Air Carrier Access Act of 1986, \nPub.L. No. 99–435, 100 Stat. 1080 (1986). However, the Supreme Court’s interpretation of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act \nwas not affected by the statutory amendment of the Air Carrier Access Act. \n \n1  An institution for mental diseases means “a hospital, nursing facility, or other institution of more than 16 beds, that is primarily \nengaged in providing diagnosis, treatment, or care of persons with mental diseases, including medical attention, nursing care, and \n \nrelated services.” 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(i) (1988). \n \n2  In 1991 the Home and Community-based Services for Mentally Ill Persons and Persons with Developmental Disabilities Act was \nrepealed and replaced by the “Home and Community-based Services for Persons with Developmental Disabilities Act”, section \n \n26–4–622 to –631 11B C.R.S. (Cum. Supp.1991). The legislative purpose of this new act states in pertinent part: \nIt is the intent of the general assembly to provide cost-effective services in the least restrictive setting to individuals who are \nmentally ill. It is from that philosophy that the general assembly authorized and the state implemented a home and \ncommunity-based services program under the auspices of a federal Medicaid waiver. Inasmuch as the federal government has \nbeen unwilling to continue Colorado’s waiver for mentally ill persons, the enabling state statutory provisions for that \nMedicaid funded program are hereby removed. However, the general assembly has an ongoing interest in examining the \nneeds of those who are in need of long-term health care because of their mental illness and in the most cost-effective mental \nhealth and supportive services as may be necessary to allow the greatest degree of independence. In furtherance of this intent, \nthe department of institutions is charged to report to the general assembly on or before January 1, 1991, on any additional \nstatutory, budget, or administrative modifications that will facilitate the goal of home and community-based care for the \nmentally ill. \n§ 26–4–622, 11B C.R.S. (Cum. Supp.1991). The legislative declaration of purpose then lists the identical goals provided in the \nrepealed statute and quoted in the text above, but omits any reference to mentally ill persons, thereby effectively including only \ndevelopmentally disabled persons within the scope of the statutory scheme. Because the events and trial of this case preceded the \nenactment of the 1991 act, the 1991 legislation is without legal significance to the issues raised in this case. \n \n3  The federal regulations implementing this statute define a handicapped person as “any person who (i) has a physical or mental \nimpairment which substantially limits one or more major life activities, (ii) has a record of such an impairment, or (iii) is regarded \n \nas having such an impairment.” 45 C.F.R. § 84.3(j) (1991). A mental impairment is further defined as “any mental or psychological \ndisorder, such as mental retardation, organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness, and specific learning disabilities.” 45 \nC.F. R. § 84.3(i)(iv)(B) (1991). The parties stipulated that Duc Van Le and the class of low income mentally ill persons fall within \nthe definition of qualified handicapped persons. \n \n4  I acknowledge that, based on the waiver provisions which allow the state to be out of compliance with the Medicaid requirements \nof statewideness, comparability, and community income and resource rules, 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(3)(1988), it can be argued that \n \nbecause the state can discriminate within a class by providing HCBS benefits to persons in one geographical area and not in \nanother, the state can also discriminate between classes by choosing to provide HCBS benefits to the elderly, the blind, the \nphysically disabled, and the developmentally disabled, but not to the mentally ill. The state, however, is justified in making \nintra-class distinctions on the basis of its authority to provide medicaid benefits to those most in need. Martinez v. Ibarra, 759 \nF.Supp. 664 (D.Colo.1991). There is no comparable justification for the state, as a recipient of Medicaid funding, to totally deny an \nentire class of any meaningful access to HCBS benefits when, as here, the state provides HCBS benefits to the elderly, the blind, \nand the physically and developmentally disabled. \n \n \n \n \t\r  \n \n \n  16 \n \n\nLe v.

Did the respondents violate the petitioner, Duc Van Le, and the class members rights under (a) section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1972,  29 U.S.C. § 794 (1988), or (b) the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution by granting benefits to the elderly, blind, physically disabled and \ndevelopmentally disabled and not to the mentally ill? \nAnswer: Yes. This court can affirm the district court’s ruling under either section 504 or the equal protection clause. Under \nsection 504, the respondents’ acceptance of federal funds triggers the statute’s anti-discrimination provision. Section 504 \nguarantees the petitioner and the class participation in the Home and Community-Based Services (“HCBS”) program that the \nstate provides for low income elderly, blind and disabled persons. The equal protection clause protects the petitioner and the \nclass because the respondents’ refusal to apply for HCBS benefits for the mentally ill is not rationally related to a legitimate \ngovernmental purpose. \n  \nA. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,  29 U.S.C. § 794 (1988) provides: \n(a) No otherwise qualified handicapped individual in the United States ... shall, solely by reason of his handicap, be excluded \nfrom the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving \nFederal financial assistance .... \n  \n*2 (b) For the purposes of this section, the term ‘program or activity’ means all of the operations of -- \n  \n(1)(A) a department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or of a local government; or \n  \n(B) the entity of such State or local government that distributes such assistance and each such department or agency (and \neach other State or local government entity) to which the assistance is extended, in the case of assistance to a State or local \ngovernment. \n  \n  \n(emphasis added) This court’s April 20, 1992, opinion recognized that the parties had stipulated that the petitioner and the \nmembers of the class are “otherwise qualified individuals” who were denied HCBS benefits solely because they are mentally \nill. 16 Brief Times Rptr. 633, 639 (Colo. 1992) The court, relying on case law decided before section 504 was amended to \nadd the definition of “program or activity,” ruled that the respondent officials of the department of social services and the \ndepartment of institutions (“the departments” or “the respondents”) did not receive federal funds within the meaning of \nsection 504. Id.2 \n  \nThe court should rule that section 504 prohibits a recipient of federal funds from excluding from participation in, and denying \nthe benefit of, or otherwise discriminating against any qualified person on the basis of a handicap. See 45 C.F.R. 84.4 (1991). \nThe respondent recipients of federal funds have denied the petitioner and the class access to HCBS benefits available to *3 \nothers on the basis that the handicap of the petitioner and the class is mental illness. See  Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. \n287, 301 (1984) (“an otherwise qualified handicapped person must be provided with meaningful access to the benefit that the \ngrantee offers”). The petitioner and the class require the same services that are provided to other handicapped recipients of \nHCBS benefits. The departments’ refusal to apply for HCBS benefits for the mentally ill violates section 504 because the \nrefusal deprives qualified handicapped persons of meaningful access to the same benefits provided to the elderly, the blind, \nand the developmentally disabled. Goebel v. Colorado Dept. of Institutions, 764 P.2d 785, 804 (Colo. 1988) (failure to \nprovide more severely disabled mentally ill persons access to services constitutes discrimination in violation of section 504); \nHomeward Bound, Inc. V. Hissom Memorial Center, No. 85-C-437-E (N.D. Okla. July 24, 1987) [available on WESTLAW, \n1987 WL 27104] (refusal to apply for HCBS benefits for mentally retarded violated section 504); Sites v. McKenzie, 423 F. \n4 \n \n\n \n \n \nDuc VAN LE, on behalf of himself and the class of..., 1992 WL 12037094...   \n \n \nSupp. 1190 (N.D. Va. 1976) (denial of vocational rehabilitation benefits on basis of person’s mental illness violates section \n504); Lynch v. Maher, 507 F. Supp. 1268 (D. Conn. 1981) (denial of homecare services on basis of handicap violates section \n504). \n  \nB. Equal Protection. \nThe district court determined that the respondents’ denial of HCBS benefits to the mentally ill violated equal protection *4 \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, applying both rational basis and strict scrutiny review.3 \nThis court’s opinion of April 20, 1992, reversed the district court ruling. \n  \nOn rehearing, should this court determine that section 504 does not prevent the departments from refusing to provide HCBS \nbenefits to the petitioner and the class, then the court should consider whether the respondents denied the petitioner and the \nclass equal protection under the heightened standard of rational basis review in  City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living \nCenter, Inc., 473 U.S. 432 (1985).4 In  Cleburne, the Supreme Court held that there was no rational basis for requiring a \nspecial use permit for group homes for the mentally retarded. 473 U.S. at 450. The heightened standard of review in Cleburne \nrequires that there be a demonstrably rational basis in fact -- rather than any “reasonably conceivable” basis in fact -- for the \ngovernmental action; that there be a demonstrably rational nexus between the classification and a legitimate governmental \npurpose; and the adverse *5 impact on the mentally retarded must be no more than an incidental burden on -- not a total \ndeprivation of -- essential services.  473 U.S. at 446; see 473 U.S. at 458 (Marshall, J., concurring in part and dissenting in \npart). \n  \nThe heightened standard of rational basis review applies also to the mentally ill. See  Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 445-46 \n(mentally ill are similarly situated to mentally retarded for equal protection purposes);  Doe v. Cowherd, 770 F. Supp. 354, \n358 (W.D. Ky. 1991). The majority on April 20, 1992, wrote that the “Cleburne analysis applies equally to persons suffering \nfrom mental illness” and utilized Cleburne’s rational relationship test to review the government’s refusal here to provide \nHCBS benefits to the mentally ill. 16 Brief Times Rptr. at 638. \n  \nThe April 20, 1992, opinion, however, did not discuss at length the application of the Cleburne standard. Instead, the court \nobserved that in 1985 “only Vermont had a waiver to provide HCBS benefits for the mentally ill,” that the staff time cost to \nthe state for reapplication was approximately $30,000, and that a federal official had said that Colorado had “little chance” of \nreceiving a waiver that would allow it to receive federal funding for HCBS benefits. 16 Brief Times Rptr. at 638-39. The \nopinion concluded that “[d]ue to the cost of reapplication and the slight chance of obtaining a waiver, it was not irrational for \nrespondents to make a policy judgment to discontinue the HCBS program for the mentally ill.” Id. at 639. \n  \n*6 The opinion ignored contrary evidence in the record that supported the district court’s findings. More than half the states \nprovide HCBS benefits for the mentally ill through Medicaid spend-down programs, a program that Colorado has not \nadopted. (Vol. 4 at 137-38) The $30,000 in staff time to prepare a reapplication pales next to the savings to the state if HCBS \nat an average cost of $400 per person each month replaces nursing home care at $1350 per person each month or \nhospitalization at $400 per person each day. (Vol. 4 at 37, 112) And a federal official believed that Colorado would have a \n“good chance” of obtaining an HCBS waiver if the state submitted a request.5 (Vol. 4 at 93) See also exhibit 6 to the \nstipulated facts (vol. 2 at 351-54). \n  \nThere was not a demonstrably rational basis in fact for the departments’ refusal since 1985 to reapply for HCBS. The federal \ngovernment’s denial of the 1985 application left open the possibility of approval upon the state’s full compliance with \nstatutory and regulatory requirements. Nor was there a demonstrably rational nexus between the classification and a \nlegitimate governmental purpose. The $30,000 in staff time to prepare a reapplication is not linked to any legitimate \ngovernmental purpose *7 to be achieved by excluding the class of the mentally ill from HCBS benefits, particularly where \nprovision of HCBS benefits for the mentally ill could save the state millions of dollars in hospital and nursing home expenses \nby preventing mentally ill persons from deteriorating to the point where, unable to assume responsibility for day-to-day \n5 \n \n\n \n \n \nDuc VAN LE, on behalf of himself and the class of..., 1992 WL 12037094...   \n \n \nself-care, they would be institutionalized or live on the streets. \n  \nFinally, the failure to provide HCBS is a deprivation of essential services for the mentally ill. The adverse burden cannot be \ntermed “incidental.”  Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 446. The state’s failure to reapply for HCBS totally deprives the petitioner and \nthe class of benefits that the state has made available to other handicapped groups in need of similar services. The state’s \ntermination of HCBS benefits for the mentally ill is discrimination that the equal protection clause as interpreted in Cleburne \nis intended to prohibit. \n  \n2. Does Congress have the power to enact a public welfare revenue sharing program that permits the states to target \ndiscrete groups for certain services? \nAnswer: Yes. The petitioner and the class acknowledge that Congress has the power to enact public welfare revenue-sharing \nprograms that permit participating states to target discreet populations for certain services. The petitioner and the class, \nhowever, assert that the targeting must be based upon the needs of each population and not simply on the basis of handicap. \n  \n*8 a. If so, is the Medicaid statute,  42 U.S.C.A. § 1396 (West 1992), and the regulations pursuant thereto, an \nexercise of that power? \nAnswer: Yes. Section 1396n(c) is an exercise of such power. It is an exception to the general structure of the Medicaid \nstatute,  42 U.S.C. § 1396, a federal-state entitlement program in which states must strictly comply with federal \nrequirements aimed at creating a uniform national program of medical benefits for poor persons. \n  \nb. Did Congress intend, by passage of either section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1972, 29 U.8.C.  § 794 (1988), \nor section 202 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1972,  42 U.S.C.A. 12132 (West 1992), to prohibit such \ntargeting and to thereby effectively amend the Medicaid statute? \nAnswer: Both section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and section 202 of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) can be \nharmonized with section 1915(c) of the Social Security Act. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and section 202 of the \nADA prevent a state from discriminating on the basis of handicap. Section 1915(c) authorizes a waiver of certain Medicaid \nrequirements that permit a state with federal involvement to develop HCBS services for the elderly, disabled, and mentally ill \n-- populations subject to frequent institutionalization.  42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c). Implementation of HCBS programs must \nmeet the antidiscrimination requirements in sections 504 and 202 in addition to the substantive requirements of section \n1915(c). \n  \n*9 As the court’s April 20, 1992, opinion noted, before 1981 many elderly, disabled, and chronically ill persons lived in \ninstitutions not because they needed medical care on a daily basis but because the institutions provided them home health \ncare and social services. 16 Brief Times Rptr. at 636. Medicaid paid for most kinds of institutional care. Section 1915(c), \nadopted in 1981, authorized federal Medicaid reimbursement for home health care and social services that until then had been \nprovided only in an institutional setting. States would be reimbursed for between 50 and 75 percent of the costs of an HCBS \nprogram if, for each person served, there was a determination that but for the provision of HCBS services, the individual \nwould require the level of care provided in a hospital or nursing facility that could be reimbursed under the state plan.  42 \nU.S.C. § 1396n(c). \n  \nMedicaid pays for hospitalization for all low income persons under age 65 (and those over 65 who are not entitled to \nMedicare) except that Medicaid does not pay for the hospitalization of the mentally ill between the ages of 21 and 65; \n6 \n \n\n \n \n \nDuc VAN LE, on behalf of himself and the class of..., 1992 WL 12037094...   \n \n \ntraditionally, states care for poor persons who are mentally ill in state-funded hospitals.  42 U.S.C. § 1396(a)(4)(A) and \n(15). Medicaid, however, pays for the care (other than active treatment for mental illness) of low income mentally ill persons \nin nursing homes.  42 U.S.C. § 1396r(b)(3)(F)(i) and  (e)(7)(G)(iii). \n  \nSection 1915(c)(7)(A) “contemplates that cost effectiveness calculations will be made for waivers that apply to ‘individuals \n*10 with a particular illness or condition.’  42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(7)(A).” 16 Brief Times Rptr. at 637. The regulations \nimplementing the statute direct a state to apply separately for HCBS benefits for three distinct groups -- persons who are aged \nor disabled, or both aged and disabled; persons who are mentally retarded or developmentally disabled, or both mentally \nretarded and developmentally disabled; and persons who are mentally ill. 42 C.F.R. § 441.301(b)(6) (1990) Before the federal \ngovernment may waive certain Medicaid statutory limitations,6 a state must convince the federal government that, among \nother things, the average per capita expenditure for an HCBS program does not exceed the average per capita expenditure for \nMedicaid-funded, institutional-based care.  42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(2)(D).7 The requirement of separate applications for the \nvarious populations is merely an administrative requirement aimed at avoiding the need to deny a waiver request for the three \npopulations when *11 there may be compliance problems with only one of the groups. [1985 Transfer Binder] Medicare and \nMedicaid Guide (CCH) § 34.532 at 9599. \n  \nRelying on section 1915(c)(7)(A) and  Beckwith v. Kizer, 912 F.2d 1139, 1140 (9th Cir. 1990), the court’s opinion of \nApril 20, 1992, observed that “a state may target patients in a class defined by a specific illness or disability.” 16 Brief Times \nRptr. at 636.8 In response to an equal protection challenge, the Beckwith court upheld a waiver program that limited HCBS \nbenefits to those persons whom home care would allow to leave an institution and return to a home environment. As the court \nnoted, the state “did not choose to limit the target group to those suffering from any particular disease or disability. It chose to \ndefine its target class in terms of the need for longterm acute hospital-level care and to look for hospitalization as a criteria.” \n912 F.2d at 1143. The court determined that the purpose of HCBS is to prevent institutionalization and that the state’s \ndefinition of a target class in terms of need for assistance to end hospitalization was rational. The court cautioned that it was \nnot deciding whether conditioning HCBS benefits upon hospitalization “would always be rationally related to a *12  § \n1396n(c) waiver, regardless of the nature of the targeted class.” Id. at 1144. Beckwith did not involve a section 504 claim of \ndiscrimination on the basis of type of handicap, and the Beckwith court was not required to harmonize and give effect to \nsection 504 and section 1915(c). \n  \nThe majority opinion in the instant case went no further than its observation that section 1915(c) allowed a state to target \npatients with a specific illness or disability. The petitioner and the class maintain that the targeting allowed is only to enable \nthe states to meet the unique needs of a particular population and to allow the federal government to determine the \ncost-effectiveness of HCBS programs for the elderly, the developmentally disabled, and the mentally ill. Here, however, \nwhere the respondents admitted that the HCBS services needed by the mentally ill are the same as those provided to the \nelderly, blind and disabled, the only targeting required is the separate application for administrative purposes. \n  \nSection 1915 does not permit states to exclude persons on the basis of the nature of their handicap. Instead, HCBS programs \nare to be based on the assessment of individual need.  42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c); H. Conf. Rep. No. 97-208, reprinted in U.S. \nCode Cong. & Admin. News 1327-29 (1981). Here, the respondents ignored individually assessed needs of the mentally ill \nand denied them benefits that are available to similarly situated elderly and developmentally disabled persons. \n  \n*13 Discrimination on the basis of type of handicap is illegal under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,  29 \nU.S.C. § 794 (1988) and  section 202 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213. \nSection 202 extended the prohibition on discrimination against disabled persons on the basis of handicap to state and local \ngovernment agencies that do not receive federal aid, to employers in the private sector, to places of public accommodation, \nand to the provision of telecommunication services. H. Rep. No. 101-485(1), 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 329 (1990). \n  \nIt is not necessary to determine -- as the court’s question implies -- whether Congress intended that section 504 or  section \n7 \n \n\n \n \n \nDuc VAN LE, on behalf of himself and the class of..., 1992 WL 12037094...   \n \n \n202 amend the Medicaid statute. Because the three statutes can be harmonized,9 there is no reason to consider whether an \nexplicit requirement under section 1915(c) was changed or nullified by the anti-discrimination laws. Whenever possible, \nstatutes should be read together and reconciled to give effect to each. M.S. v. People, 812 P.2d 632 (Colo. 1991);   *14 \nState Dept. of Revenue v. Borquez, 751 P.2d 639, 643 (Colo. 1988). Statutory construction “must begin with the statute’s \nlanguage.”  Mallard v. U.S. District Court for Southern District of Iowa, 490 U.S. 296 (1989). Courts must apply the plan \nand ordinary meaning of language when construing a statute. People v. District Court, 713 P.2d 918 (Colo. 1986). \n  \nIn section 504, Congress stated that “no otherwise qualified handicapped individual ... shall solely be reason of his handicap, \nbe excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under any program ... \nreceiving federal financial assistance.” In the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, Congress defined programs under section \n504 to include “all of the operations of a department ... of a state ... government.”  29 U.S.C. § 794. In 1990, Congress \nreaffirmed its intent to make illegal discrimination on the basis of handicap in publicly funded programs and benefits by \nenacting section 202 of the ADA. Once again, in plain language, Congress declared that “no qualified individual with a \ndisability shall by reason of such disability be excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of the services, programs, \nor activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.  42 U.S.C. § 12132. Section 1915(c) \nestablishes a federally funded program -- HCBS -- that is administered by departments of state government. To exempt \nHCBS from sections 504 and  202 would violate the plain meaning of the statutes. \n  \n*15 The beneficent purpose of section 1915(c) is to provide alternative community based services -- less restrictive and less \ncostly -- that will allow disabled people who would otherwise be institutionalized to remain in the community. The purpose \nof section 504 and the ADA is to allow disabled persons to participate fully in society by eliminating discriminatory barriers \nto their participation. The purposes of the statutes are congruent; a harmonious interpretation gives full effect to the \nprovisions of section 1915 and, as required under section 504 and the ADA, eliminates the discriminatory exclusion of \nqualified handicapped persons from participation in government programs. \n  \n3. Did the enactment of the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, Pub. L. No. 100-259, 102 Stat. 28 (1988), overturn the \nrationale of  United States Department of Transportation v. Paralyzed Veterans, 477 U.S. 597 (1986), and other \nUnited States Supreme Court cases? \nAnswer: Yes. \n  \nIn the April 20, 1992, opinion -- recognizing that the parties had stipulated that the petitioner and the class are “otherwise \nqualified individuals” who were denied HCBS benefits solely because they are mentally ill -- this court addressed only \nwhether the respondents received federal funds within the meaning of section 504. 16 Brief Times Rptr. at 639. This court \ndetermined that the nondiscrimination provision in section 504 was a contractual cost to those who receive federal assistance \nfor a particular program, and because the respondents did not accept funds for an HCBS program for the mentally ill, the \n“nondiscrimination *16 provision of section 504 was not triggered.” Id. The ruling was based entirely on  United States \nDep’t of Transp. v. Paralyzed Veterans of America, 477 U.S. 597 (1986).10 \n  \nCongress overruled the express rationale of Paralyzed Veterans when it adopted the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987.11 \nThe Civil Rights Restoration Act amended section 504 by adding the definition of “program or activity” in section 504(b), \nsupra. at 2, to make clear that section 504 prohibits discrimination throughout entire agencies or institutions if any part of the \nagency or institution receives federal financial assistance. The purpose of the amendment was to restore the institution-wide \ncoverage of section 504 that prevailed before the Supreme Court decisions in  Grove City College v. Bell, 465 U.S. 555 \n(1984) and Paralyzed Veterans. S. Rep. No. 100-64, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 3-13, 18 (1988). \n  \nThe respondent departments receive millions of dollars each year in federal financial assistance for all programs, including \nHCBS benefits for the elderly, blind and disabled. When this *17 class action was commenced in November 1988, section \n8 \n \n\n \n \n \nDuc VAN LE, on behalf of himself and the class of..., 1992 WL 12037094...   \n \n \n504 prevented discrimination or denial of benefits by reason of a persons’s handicap if the respondents received federal funds \nfor any of their programs. The majority erred when it held that section 504 does not apply because the respondents did not \nreceive federal funds for HCBS for the mentally ill. \n  \n4. Did the enactment of section 2 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C.A. §§ 12101 (West 1992), \ncause Duc Van Le and the class to become a suspect class protected by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution? \nAnswer: Yes. The court need not reach this question unless it determines that the respondents’ refusal to provide HCBS \nbenefits for the mentally ill does not violate section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and is rationally related to a legitimate \ngovernmental purpose. The legislative findings section of the ADA is a Congressional determination that the mentally ill \ncomprise a suspect class for purposes of equal protection analysis. 42 U.S.C. § 12101(7). The respondents did not describe a \nsignificant governmental objective -- let alone a compelling governmental interest -- served by their refusal to apply for \nHCBS benefits for the mentally ill. Thus, the respondents’ refusal to provide HCBS benefits for the mentally ill does not \nsurvive strict scrutiny review. \n  \nCongress adopted the legislative findings of the ADA after the Supreme Court indicated that the heightened rational \nrelationship standard in Cleburne would apply to classifications that *18 discriminated against the mentally ill.12 The \nlegislative findings are a Congressional declaration that the mentally ill are a suspect class for purposes of equal protection \nanalysis.13 Congress found that individuals who have experienced discrimination on the basis of a disability, including mental \nillness, are a \n  \ndiscrete and insular minority who have been faced with restrictions and limitations, subjected to a history of purposeful \nunequal treatment and relegated to a position of political powerlessness in our society, based on characteristics that are \nbeyond the control of such individuals and resulting from stereotypic assumptions not truly indicative of the individual ability \nof such individuals to participate in, and contribute to, society. \n  \n42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7). \n  \nA governmental classification is considered suspect if it singles out religious, racial or other discrete and insular minorities \nfor unequal treatment.  Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307, 313 (1976);  United States v. \nCarolene Products Co., 304 U.S. 144, 152-53, n.4 (1938);  Lujan v. Colorado State Bd. of Educ., 649 P.2d 1005, 1020-21 \n(Colo. 1982). A suspect class is one saddled with such disabilities, subjected to such a history of purposeful unequal \ntreatment, or relegated to such a position of political powerlessness as to *19 command extraordinary protection from the \nmajoritarian political process.  Murgia, 427 U.S. at 313;  San Antonio School District v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 28 \n(1973);  Lujan, 649 P.2d at 1020-21. Members of a suspect class may be subjected to disabilities due to “stereotyped \ncharacteristics not truly indicative of their abilities.”  Murgia. 427 U.S. at 313. \n  \nIf the government action or classification operates to the disadvantage of a suspect class or adversely affects the exercise of a \nfundamental right,14 equal protection analysis requires strict scrutiny review.  Murgia, 427 U.S. at 312. Strict scrutiny \nrequires that the government action or classification further a compelling government interest.  Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 440. \n  \nIn the instant case, the district court determined that mental illness constitutes a suspect classification for purposes of equal \nprotection  analysis.  (vol.  3,  p.  574)  The  district  court  also  determined  that  the  respondents  showed  no  compelling \ngovernmental interest to support the unequal and discriminatory treatment of plaintiff and class members. (vol. 3, pp. 574, \n722) For the same reasons that the state failed to demonstrate a legitimate governmental interest in its refusal to provide the \npetitioner *20 and the class access to HCBS benefits, the state also failed to establish the more rigorous compelling \ngovernmental interest. The respondents’ denial of HCBS benefits to the mentally ill violates the petitioner’s and the class’ \n9 \n \n\n \n \n \nDuc VAN LE, on behalf of himself and the class of..., 1992 WL 12037094...   \n \n \nrights to equal protection. \n  \n5. Did the enactment of section 202 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990,  42 U.S.C.A. § 12132 (West \n1992), have retroactive application? \nAnswer: Yes. Again, the court need not reach this issue if it determines that the respondents violated section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act or the equal protection clause in denying the petitioner and the class access to HCBS benefits. Section 202 \nof the ADA reaffirmed section 504’s ban on discrimination in programs receiving federal financial assistance. In cases of this \nkind, a court is to apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision.  Bradley v. Richmond School Board, 416 U.S. \n696, 711 (1974); Goebel v. Colo. Department of Institutions, 764 P.2d 785, 799 n. 17 (Colo. 1988). \n  \nSection 202 of the ADA became effective on January 26, 1992. It provides: \nSubject to the provisions of this title, no qualified individual with a disability shall by reason of such \ndisability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs or \nactivities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity. \n  \n  \n42 U.S.C. § 12132.  Section 202 reaffirms and extends Congress’ previous ban of discrimination on the basis of \nhandicap in all *21 programs receiving federal financial assistance.15 Consequently, there is no injustice in applying \nsection 202 “retroactively” to the instant case. \n  \nMoreover, in cases of this kind, a court is to apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision unless doing so would \nresult in manifest injustice or there is statutory direction or legislative history to the contrary.  Bradley, 416 U.S. at 711 \n(statute that awarded attorney fees in desegregation cases became effective while appeal pending); Goebel, 764 P.2d at 799 n. \n17 (statute limiting right to community based mental health services became effective while case pending). In Goebel the \ncourt observed that the general rule had “cogency” because the court was overseeing the development of a mental health plan \nthat would be applied prospectively. 764 P.2d at 799 n. 17. Similarly, the petitioner and the class in the instant case seek \nprospective injunctive relief to correct the respondents’ failure to provide the mentally ill access to HCBS services. \nSection 202 *22 does not contain direction nor does there exist legislative history that contradicts the general rule. \n  \nIf this court should rule that  section 202 provides relief for the petitioner and the class and that section 504 and the \nconstitution do not provide relief, there is no reason that the petitioner and the class should have to start over to obtain \nprospective injunctive relief.  Section 202 should have what the court described as “retroactive application.” \n  \na. If so, did the respondents violate  section 202 by failing to provide HCBS benefits to Duc Van Le and the \nmembers of the class? \nAnswer: Yes. \n  \nSection 202 of the ADA reaffirms the prohibition of discrimination on the basis of handicap in section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act. Section 504 provides that no “qualified handicapped individual” shall be excluded solely by reason of his \nhandicap “from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination” under any program receiving \n10 \n \n\n \n \n \nDuc VAN LE, on behalf of himself and the class of..., 1992 WL 12037094...   \n \n \nfederal financial assistance.  29 U.S.C. § 794.  Section 202 provides that “no qualified individual with a disability” \nshall by reason of that disability be excluded “from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs or \nactivities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such *23 entity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12132.16 The ADA \ndefines the term “disability” as “a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits” one or more of an individual’s \n“major life activities,” and mental impairment includes mental illness. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A); H. Rep. No. 101-485(II), \n101st  Cong.,  2d  Sess.  333  (1990).  Thus,  section  202  of  the  ADA  extends  section  504’s  ban  on  discrimination  to \ndiscrimination by any public entity, not just those receiving federal financial assistance. Otherwise, the sections are identical. \n  \nFor the same reasons that this court’s majority opinion of April 20, 1992, recognized that the parties had stipulated that the \npetitioner and the class under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act are “otherwise qualified individuals” who were denied \nHCBS benefits solely because they are mentally ill, 16 Brief Times Rptr. at 639, this court should recognize that the \npetitioner and the class under section 202 of the ADA are qualified individuals who were denied HCBS benefits solely \nbecause they are mentally ill. The respondents’ refusal to provide the mentally ill with access to HCBS benefits violates \nsection 202.17 \n  \nFootnotes \n \n1  The petitioner and the class do not take exception to the facts as stated in the introduction and part I of the majority opinion of \n  April 20, 1992. \n \n2  The petitioner and the class respond to this portion of the court’s ruling in their answer to question 3. \n   \n3  The petitioner and the class address strict scrutiny review in response to the court’s fourth question. \n   \n4  A ruling that the respondents’ failure to provide HCBS benefits impermissibly discriminated against the mentally ill is no more \n  than a ruling that the respondents did not have a demonstrably rational basis in fact for their action. If the court rules that the \nrespondents’ failure to provide HCBS benefits violated the right of the petitioner and the class to equal protection under the \nCleburne standard, the court does not need to address the issues raised in questions 2 through 5. \n \n5  The district court found that since 1985 Colorado has not applied for HCBS for the mentally ill and has not sought assistance from \n  the federal government to develop a waiver from Medicaid requirements that would allow HCBS for the mentally ill. (vol. 2, p. \n263; vol. 4, p. 132) \n \n6  Section 1915(c)(3) lists the statutory limitations that are subject to waiver: section 1396a(a)(1) relating to statewideness; section \n  1396a(a)(10)(B) relating to comparability, and section 1396a(a)(10)(C)(i)(III) relating to income and resource rules applicable in \nthe community.  42 U.S.C. §1396n(c)(3). \n \n7  Colorado’s 1985 application for a waiver for HCBS benefits for the mentally ill was rejected because federal investigators \n  determined that a majority of the mentally ill recipients were not eligible for Medicaid. They were not eligible for Medicaid \nbecause, according to the investigators, they would be patients in a state mental hospital were it not for HCBS services. The state’s \n“holding” patients released from a mental hospital for fifteen days before providing HCBS was not sufficient to make the \nindividuals eligible. 16 Brief Times Rptr. at 634. See stipulated exhibit 6, v. 2, pp.339-44. \n \n8  This is as close as the court’s opinion gets to addressing question 2. The court determined that the Medicaid statute allows a state to \n  “target” patients who are mentally ill, but it did not address whether sections 504 and 202 “prohibit such targeting.” \n \n9  If this court determines that the provisions of section 1915(c)(7)(A) that establish the categories for determining cost effectiveness \n  of HCBS programs authorize discrimination in the provision of HCBS programs on the basis of handicap, then section 1915(c) \nconflicts with sections 504 and  202. An irreconcilable conflict between statutes requires the court to give full effect to the \nprovisions of the law most recently enacted. City of Littleton v. Board of County Commissioners, 787 P.2d 158, 162 (Colo. 1990); \nPublic Employees Retirement Ass’n v. Nichols, 615 P.2d 657, 658 (Colo. 1980). The most recently enacted statutes are section 504 \nas amended in 1987 and  section 202, enacted in 1990. \n11 \n \n\n \n \n \nDuc VAN LE, on behalf of himself and the class of..., 1992 WL 12037094...   \n \n \n \n10 \nThe opinion of April 20, 1992, quoted a paragraph from  Paralyzed Veterans, 477 U.S. at 605-06. The quotation omitted the \n \nfollowing United States Supreme Court language from the middle of the paragraph: “We relied upon this same rationale in \nGrove City College v. Bell, 465 U.S. 555 (1984), where we noted that the recipient of the federal assistance -- the College -- \nwas free to terminate its participation in the federal grant program and thus avoid the requirements of Title IX [of the Education \nAmendments of 1972].” \n \n11  The Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 became law on March 22, 1988. \n   \n12  The ADA was signed into law on July 26, 1990. \n   \n13 \nCongressional findings of fact may be binding on the courts.  South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301 (1966) (applying \n \nfindings in Voting Rights Act of 1965). \n \n14  The court’s question addresses only suspect class. The petitioner and the class argued in their original briefs before this court that \n  the classification adversely affected their exercise of a fundamental right, i.e. their fundamental liberty interest in being treated and \nliving in the least restrictive community setting. See Answer brief, pp. 24-29. \n \n15 \nIn passing  section 202, Congress was aware that \n \nTitle V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits recipients of Federal Financial Assistance from discriminating against \nindividuals with disabilities. Many agencies of State and local government receive federal aid and thus are currently prohibited \nfrom engaging in discrimination on the basis of disability. \nH.R. Rep. No. 101-485(I), 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 318 (1990), attached as exhibit A to petitioner’s surreply brief. \n \n16  The use of the term “disability” instead of “handicap” was an effort by Congress to “make use of up-to-date, currently accepted \n  terminology.” H. Rep. No. 101-485(II), 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 332 (1990). \n \n17  For more detailed legal argument on the issues addressed by all of the court’s questions, see the petitioner’s answer brief and \n  surreply brief. \n \n \n   \n \n \n12 \n ",

Did the State of Colorado violate Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as amended which prohibits denying \nbenefits to individuals on the basis of their handicap when the state offered HCBS benefits to the elderly, blind, and \nphysically disabled but denied HCBS benefits to the otherwise qualified mentally disabled? \n  \n2. Does the marginal social status, political powerlessness, severe disabilities, and unequal treatment of the mentally disabled \ncompel the Court to recognize their suspect class status deserving of the judicial protection which strict scrutiny ensures \nunder the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution? \n  \n3. Does the state have a valid compelling interest in withholding HCBS benefits from the mentally disabled when it is \nsignificantly more expensive to continue to institutionalize the mentally disabled than to maintain them through the HCBS \nprogram? \n  \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n  \nPlaintiff Duc Van Le brought a class action against Irene M. Ibarra as Director of the Colorado Department of Social \nServices; Robert Bauserman, Robbie L. Bean, Suzanne D. Dosh, Dennis Fisher, Mary Kyer, Peggy Stokstad, John P. Stone, \nand Richard F. Walker as members of the Colorado Board of Social Services; and Henry Solano as Director of the Colorado \nDepartment of Institutions, \n  \nThe District Court, City and County of Denver with Judge Carelli presiding certified the plaintiff class pursuant to Colo. R. \nCiv. P. 26 (b)(1) and (b)(2) as low income mentally ill Colorado residents who qualify for but are denied Home and \nCommunity Based Services (“HCBS”) due to their mental illness by the state defendants (“State”). The State extends the \n4 \n \n\n \n \n \nDuc VAN LE, on behalf of himself and the class of..., 1992 WL 12037091...   \n \n \nsame federally funded HCBS benefits to elderly, blind, and physically and developmentally disabled individuals. \n  \nThe district court ruled the State’s segregation of the mentally disabled from the HCBS benefit program violated the  *2 \nplaintiff’s and class members’ rights under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,  29 U.S.C. § 794 (1988) \n(“Section 504”) amended by Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, Pub. L. No. 100-259, 102 Stat. 28 (codified as amended at \n20 U.S.C. § 1687 (1988)). Le v. Ibarra, No. 88CV22461, slip op. at 11 (Aug. 23, 1990). Citing  United States v. Carolene \nProducts Co., 304 U.S. 144, 152 n.4 (1938) and  Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307 (1976) inter \nalia, the district court also held the mentally ill constitute a suspect class under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution. Slip op. at 13. \n  \nOn the basis of the stipulated facts and findings of fact, the district court ruled that the State failed to demonstrate a \ncompelling governmental interest in segregating the mentally ill from the HCBS program at issue, and in its Decision and \nOrder of August 23, 1990 the court ordered the State to provide HCBS benefits to the plaintiff class as long as the State \ncontinues the same benefits to the elderly, blind, and physically disabled. Slip op. at 14. The State appealed and this Court \ngranted certiorari pursuant to C.A.R. 50 and ruled the State did not violate the plaintiff’s and class members’ rights under \nSection 504, nor did the mentally ill constitute a suspect class for equal protection purposes. Lee v. Ibarra, No. 91SC189, slip \nop. at 31 (Colo. Apr. 20, 1992). Citing  United States Dep’t of Transp. v. Paralyzed Veterans of America, 477 U.S. 597 \n(1986), this Court determined the anti-discrimination constraints of Section 504 did not apply to the State HCBS program. \nThis Court reasoned that *3 although the State receives federal funds for the HCBS program, the State did not receive federal \nfunds to provide HCBS to the plaintiff class, so the anti-discrimination provisions of Section 504 were not triggered. Slip op. \nat 30. \n  \nJustice Lohr joined Justice Quinn in dissent and argued the majority erroneously reasoned Section 504 did not apply, and that \nthe State’s denial of federally funded HCBS benefits constituted an egregious and adverse impact on the mentally ill. Dissent, \nslip op. at 16. Citing  City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center Inc., 473 U.S. 432 (1985), Justice Quinn maintained that \nthe State’s exclusion of the mentally ill from the HCBS program did not further any rational and legitimate State interest, and \ntherefore was unlawful under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \nDissent, slip op. at 12-14. \n  \nThe Court granted plaintiff’s petition for rehearing and accepted briefs of amici curiae in support of petitioner in its Order \ndated May 28, 1992. This order also specified five issues to be addressed by the parties in supplemental briefs. The Colorado \nPsychiatric Society’s (“Society”) arguments in this amicus brief will address only the following issues presented by the \nCourt: \n  \n1. Did the respondents violate the petitioner, Duc Van Le, and the class members rights under Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973,  29 U.S.C. § 794 (1988), or the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution by granting benefits to the elderly, blind, physically disabled and developmentally disabled and \nnot to the mentally ill? \n  \n*4 3. Did the enactment of the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, Pub. L. No. 100-259, 102 Stat. 28 (1988), overturn the \nrationale of  United States Department of Transportation v. Paralyzed Veterans, 477 U.S. 597 (1986), and other United \nStates Supreme Court cases? \n  \n4. Did the enactment of section 2 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C.A. § 12101 (West 1992), cause \nDuc Van Lee and the class to become a suspect class protected by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \nto the United States Constitution? \n  \nINTEREST OF AMICUS CURIAE REGARDING THE SPECIAL STATUS OF THE SEVERE MENTALLY ILL \n5 \n \n\n \n \n \nDuc VAN LE, on behalf of himself and the class of..., 1992 WL 12037091...   \n \n \nIndividuals who suffer chronic major medical psychiatric illness, primarily schizophrenia and manic depressive illness, \ncomprise the severe or chronic mentally ill. Historically the majority ostracized the severe mentally ill from mainstream \nsociety. Fear and misunderstanding relegate the mentally ill to a marginal existence on the periphery of society. Within the \nprevious century, popular opinion held the mentally ill were the victims of demonic possession. See Norman Dain, Concepts \nof Insanity in the United States, 1789-1965 xi (1964). \n  \nThe severe mentally ill are not thought of the same way as individuals suffering from cardiovascular disease, cancer, \ndiabetes, and other life long chronic illnesses, but are segregated and treated in institutions with entirely separate systems of \nmaintenance and care. This institutionalization of the mentally ill began in the nineteenth century and continues today in \nlarge state hospitals. Period depictions of treatment of the mentally ill in early state institutions are characterized by horrific \naccounts of inhumane conditions. See, e.g. Emil *5 Kraepelin, One Hundred Years of Psychiatry (1962). While isolated \nnineteenth century attempts to pursue a “moral treatment” policy of the mentally ill lead to some individual enlightened \nhospitals, such humane institutions largely benefited only upper-and upper-middle class patients. The majority of low-income \nor black mentally ill persons “found themselves in jails or workhouses.” William C. Cockerham, Sociology of Mental \nDisorder 21 (2d ed. 1989). A contemporary description of the unfortunate conditions that persist in some institutions for the \nmentally disabled is recounted in Homeward Bound, Inc. v. Hissom Memorial Center, No. 85-C-437-E, 1987 WL 27104, at \n*9-13 (N.D. Okla. July 24, 1987). \n  \nAll chronic illnesses, including severe mental illness, require ongoing treatment whether it be in the hospital, outpatient, or \nhome health care. In addition to their mental disabilities, the mentally ill often suffer from physical illnesses, such as peptic \nulcer and infection. However, it is often difficult for the severe mentally ill to access the current health care system due to \nboth their discounted disability and their aggravating handicaps in thinking and processing information. \n  \nVarious mistaken beliefs about the severe mentally ill limit their access to care. Public opinion and some caregivers feel these \nindividuals are in some way responsible for their illness and could “help themselves.” Others believe there is “no cure” \ndespite dramatic advances due to psychotherapy, pharmaceutical treatment, and community mental health centers. See \nCockerham, *6 supra at 25-27. Additionally, although psychiatry is a sub-specialty of medicine, allocation of resources for \nthe treatment of severe mental illness has been excluded from main stream funding. \n  \nAccess to treatment for severe mentally ill individuals has steadily decreased in Colorado over the last thirty years. In the \nearly 1960s, Colorado was a leader in the national trend of establishing community based health care, both for primary \nmedical care as well as primary psychiatric care. This allowed mentally ill individuals to be treated and maintained in the \ncommunity, and deinstitutionalized many who were previously segregated in remote state hospitals. Patients with severe \nmental illness often were integrated into the home care programs of the Visiting Nurse Association and the county nurses, \nwho did not make a distinction between medical psychiatric illness and other physical illness. They visited homes, helped \nindividuals with their psychiatric medications, socialization, transportation, and facilitated total health care. However, as the \nnumber of individuals with severe mental illness increased community programs have been reduced or eliminated. \n  \nAs a result, the severe mentally ill are now in an impossible situation. Community programs have been sharply cut or \neliminated. Despite their need for total health care, the severe mentally ill are unable to access mental health treatment \nprograms, primary health care programs and social service programs. The unfortunate consequence is that without the home \nand community based services the state extends to other disabled *7 individuals at issue in this case, the severe mentally ill \nbecome caught up in a recurring cycle of hospitalization, nursing home placement, placement in the community, and \nde-stabilization that renews the institutionalization process or leads to other unfortunate consequences. See, e.g., Lisa Newell, \nNote, America’s Homeless Mentally Ill: Falling Through a Dangerous Crack, 15 New Eng. J. on Crim. & Civ. Confinement \n277 (1989). \n  \nUniquely aware of this dark history of societal treatment of the severe mentally ill, the Society is particularly interested in the \nissues raised in this case. The Society possesses an informed professional perspective regarding chronic mental illness in \nColorado and the characteristics of the severe mentally ill as a discrete group. The Society’s brief amicus curiae is intended to \ndemonstrate that the law as applied to the remarkable evidence available enables this Court to recognize the severe mentally \nill as a special group, warranting extraordinary judicial vigilance and protection due to their severe disabilities, political \npowerlessness, and the historical discrimination against them. \n6 \n \n\n \n \n \nDuc VAN LE, on behalf of himself and the class of..., 1992 WL 12037091...   \n \n \n  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n  \n1. As shown by the plain meaning of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,  29 U.S.C. § 794 (1988) as amended, \nthe implementing regulations, and the judicial interpretation of Section 504, the State violated the plaintiffs’ rights by \ndenying them the HCBS benefits offered to elderly, blind and physically disabled individuals. \n  \n2. The authority relied on by this Court to prevent the application of the anti-discrimination provisions of Section 504 *8 was \nexpressly overruled by Congress in the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, Pub. L. No. 100-259, 102 Stat. 28 (codified as \namended at 20 U.S.C. § 1687 (1988)). \n  \n3. Under the criteria identified in  Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307 (1976), plaintiffs constitute a \nsuspect class for purposes of determining their rights to equal protection of the laws. \n  \n4. In the plain meaning and legislative history of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Congress recognized the \nsevere mentally ill constitute a suspect class under the Fourteenth Amendment. \n  \n5. On the basis of the evidence available to this Court, the State has failed to demonstrate a compelling government interest in \nwithholding HCBS benefits from plaintiffs. \n  \nARGUMENT \nI. THE DISTRICT COURT CORRECTLY RULED THAT THE STATE’S DENIAL OF HCBS BENEFITS TO THE \nMENTALLY DISABLED UNACCEPTABLY VIOLATES THE PLAINTIFFS’RIGHTS UNDER Section 504 OF \nTHE REHABILITATION ACT OF 1973, AS AMENDED. \nA. The Stipulations of Fact and the District Court’s Findings of Fact Establish That the State Extends HCBS Benefits to \nthe Elderly. Blind. Physically and Developmentally Disabled While Excluding Plaintiffs Solely on the Nature of Their \nDisability. \nThe State of Colorado through the defendant Department of Social Services (“Social Services”) currently extends HCBS \nbenefits to elderly, blind, physically and developmentally disabled persons who meet applicable income requirements. \nStipulation 45 (R. Vol. 2, p. 264). HCBS programs in the state provide a variety of health care services in a non-institutional \n*9  setting,  including  personal  care  services,  homemaker  services,  home  medication  monitoring,  and  non-medical \ntransportation. Stipulations of Fact 40-43 (R. Vol. 3, pp. 263-264). The HCBS program at issue is statutorily authorized by \nSection 1915(c) of the Social Security Act which through its implementing regulations authorizes benefits for three classes of \npeople: \na. elderly, blind and physically disabled persons; \n  \nb. mentally ill persons; and \n  \nc. developmentally disabled persons. \n  \n  \n42 C.F.R. 441.301(b)(6). \n  \nThe goal of federally funded HCBS programs is to prevent needless institutionalization of the three target populations of \nindividuals. The federal government reimburses states between 50% and 75% of the cost of the state administered HCBS \n7 \n \n\n \n \n \nDuc VAN LE, on behalf of himself and the class of..., 1992 WL 12037091...   \n \n \nprograms through a Medicaid Title XIX waiver system. The waiver system conditions federal reimbursement upon the state’s \nproof that the cost of Medicaid funded nursing home care for qualified individuals exceeds the cost of care through the HCBS \nprogram.  42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(2)(D); 42 C.F.R. 441.302. \n  \nBetween 1982 and 1985, the State secured waivers from the federal government to provide HCBS services to elderly, blind, \nphysically and developmentally disabled, and mentally ill individuals. In 1985 the federal government requested the State to \nwithdraw and resubmit its HCBS mentally ill renewal application. Upon resubmission the federal government rejected the \nState’s waiver application for the HCBS mentally ill program and outlined substantive areas that required revision before \ngranting the HCBS mentally ill application. Stipulation 35 (R. *10 Vol. 2, p. 263). The State made no documented attempts \nin the five years following 1985 to reapply for federal funds for an HCBS program for the mentally ill. Stipulations 35, 51 \nand 52 (R. Vol. 2, pp. 263, 265). In fact Social Services went so far as to prepare legislation that when passed successfully \nrepealed the statutory authorization which allowed the mentally ill to participate in the HCBS program. See Home and \nCommunity Based Services for Person with Developmental Disabilities Act, ch. 217, secs. 1-8, §§ 26-4.5-201-to-209, 1990 \nColo. Sess. Laws 1380-82 (current version at  §§ 26-4-621 to -631, 11B C.R.S. (1991 Supp.)). \n  \nSocial Services continued to extend HCBS benefits to elderly, blind, and physically disabled individuals with income levels \nequally as low as the plaintiff class. Stipulation 45 (R. Vol. 2, p. 264). Although plaintiffs’ meet necessary income and \nmedical requirements to qualify for the HCBS benefits currently offered the elderly, blind, and physically disabled, the State \nprovides them no services. Stipulations 40-43, 46 (R. Vol.4, pp. 263-264). Rather plaintiffs are denied support of the HCBS \nbenefits because their primary diagnosis is mental illness. Stipulation 45 (R. Vol. 4, pp. 263-264). \n  \nWithout HCBS benefits, low income mentally ill individuals within Colorado that comprise the plaintiff class are shuttled \namong  hospital,  nursing  home,  community  placement  and  subsequent  de-stabilization  that  leads  to  renewed \ninstitutionalization.  The  absence  of  HCBS  benefits  for  the  low  income  mentally  ill  effectively  prevents  their  stable \nmaintenance in a dignified *11 community setting and relegates them to the constraints of the institution. (R. Vol. 4, pp. \n63-64, 89). \n  \nB. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 Requires the State to Extend HCBS Benefits to all Qualified Disabled \nIndividuals. \n1. Section 504. \nIn  Southeastern Community College v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397 (1979) the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed that the principle \nthat statutory construction begins with the language of the statute itself applies in interpreting Section 504. Id. at 405. \nAnalysis of the plain language of Section 504 and its implementing regulations demonstrate the unequivocal proscription \nagainst denying qualified disabled individuals participation in or withholding benefits from any federally funded program. \n  \nSection 504(a) provides: \n(a) No otherwise qualified individual with handicaps in the United States ... shall, solely by reason of her \nor his handicap, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance ... \n  \n  \nThe Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“Act”), § 504,  29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (1988)(emphasis added). A qualified handicapped \nindividual within the scope of Section 504 is defined as one with either physical or mental impairment: \n8 \n \n\n \n \n \nDuc VAN LE, on behalf of himself and the class of..., 1992 WL 12037091...   \n \n \n(B) [T]he term “individual with handicaps” means, for purposes of titles IV and V of this Act [ 29 \nUSCS §§ 780 et seq,.  790 et seq.], any person who (i) has a physical or mental impairment which \nsubstantially limits one or more of such person’s major life activities, (ii) has a record of such an \nimpairment, or (iii) is regarded as having such an impairment. \n  \n  \n*12 29 U.S.C.S. § 706(8)(B) (emphasis added). It is obvious that any distinction between physical and mental is solely for \ndescriptive purposes in order to define impairment fully. The words do not create different categories justifying separate \ntreatment. Therefore Congress mandated through the plain language of the Act that the mentally disabled are handicapped \nindividuals and protected under the Act. \n  \n2. Section 504 Regulations. \nThe federal implementing regulations of Section 504 further emphasize the broad prohibition against discrimination directed \ntowards qualified handicapped individuals, including by definition the severe mentally ill1. Discrimination that constitutes a \nviolation of Section 504 is described in considerable detail: \n  \na. Deny[ing] a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service; \nb. Afford[ing] a qualified handicapped person an opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that \nis not equal to that afforded others; \n  \nc. [Providing] a qualified handicapped person with an aid, benefit, or service that is not as effective as that provided to others; \n  \nd. [Providing] different or separate aid, benefits, or services to handicapped persons or to any class of handicapped persons \nunless action is necessary to provide qualified handicapped persons with aid, *13 benefits, or services that are as effective as \nthose provides to others; \n  \ne. Otherwise limit[ing] a qualified handicapped person in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity \nenjoyed by others receiving an aid, benefit or service. \n  \n  \n45 C.F.R. 84.4(b)(1). It is evident based on the plain meaning of the implementing regulations of Section 504 and its \nimplementing regulations, Duc Van Le and the class members constitute handicapped individuals who may not be excluded \nfrom any federally funded program solely on the nature of their disability. \n  \n3. Judicial Interpretation of Section 504. \nCases construing Section 504 also establish that the state’s denial of HCBS benefits to plaintiffs violates their rights under the \nAct. In  Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985), the United States Supreme Court addressed Section 504 in ruling that \nTennessee’s annual reduction from 20 days to 14 days of Medicaid reimbursed inpatient hospital care did not unfairly \ndiscriminate against the handicapped. Id. at 309. The Court rejected Tennessee’s argument that Section 504 only prohibited \npurposeful discrimination against the handicapped and specifically noted that much of the discrimination Congress sought to \noutlaw resulted from insensitivity and apathy toward the plight of the handicapped. Id. at 296-97. However, the Court wisely \nrejected the argument that any untoward affect upon the handicapped constituted actionable discrimination under Section \n504. Id. at 299. \n  \n9 \n \n\n \n \n \nDuc VAN LE, on behalf of himself and the class of..., 1992 WL 12037091...   \n \n \nIn expressing its balanced interpretation in Choate, the Court held that Section 504 requires “that an otherwise qualified \nhandicapped individual must be provided with meaningful access to *14 the benefit that the grantee offers.” Id. at 301. \nSignificantly, the court also stated that an agency may not simply define the benefit offered in such a way to exclude \nparticipation by qualified handicapped individuals. Id. Finally the Court recognized that the policy directive behind Section \n504 mandates that handicapped individuals receive “evenhanded treatment ... to participate in and benefit from programs \nreceiving federal assistance.” Id. at 304. \n  \nThus, it is evident that the State’s attempts to define the program as HCBS-EBD and to deny benefits solely on the basis of \nmental illness are contrary to both the policy directives and statutory requirements of Section 504. Therefore the State’s \nattempt  to  exclude  plaintiffs,  otherwise  qualified  handicapped  individuals,  from  participation  in  the  HCBS  program \nconstitutes an actionable violation of Section 504 as recognized by the Choate Court. \n  \nThis Court has also expressly recognized that the anti-discrimination protection of Section 504 extends to the chronic \nmentally ill in Goebel v. Colorado Dept. of Institutions, 764 P.2d 785 (Colo. 1988). In Goebel this Court held, inter alia, that \nthe State withheld federally funded services from the plaintiff class of severe mentally ill individuals on the basis of the \nseverity of their disability in violation of Section 504. Id. at 804. Additionally the Court ruled the plaintiffs were entitled to \nthe injunctive relief necessary to permit significant access to the benefits and services then excluding otherwise qualified \nhandicapped individuals. Id. at 805. \n  \n*15 Like the class in Goebel, the plaintiff class in the instant case are excluded from federally funded health care program \nbenefits for disabled individuals because their primary diagnosis involves mental illness. As here, those excluded in Goebel \nwere the severe mentally ill. This Court addressed precisely this prohibited and unfortunate discrimination by observing “we \nassume that the severity of the plaintiffs’ handicaps is itself a handicap which, under Section 504 of the 1973 Rehabilitation \nAct, cannot be the sole reason for denying them [adult day care] funding.” Goebel, 764 P.2d at 804, (emphasis in the original) \n(quoting  Plummer v. Branstadt, 731 F.2d 574, 578 (8th Cir. 1984). \n  \nIn Goebel this Court relied on the construction of Section 504 adopted in Homeward Bound, Inc. v. Hissom Memorial Center, \nNo. 85-C-437-E, 1987 WL 27104 (N.D. Okla. July 24, 1987). Goebel, 764 P.2d at 804. In Homeward Bound the plaintiff \nclass of retarded individuals who were or had been clients of the Hissom Memorial Center (“Hissom”), a large institution for \nthe retarded, successfully brought action against Hissom for violation, inter alia, of Section 504. Homeward Bound, at *21. \nThe  court  found  that  the  State  of  Oklahoma  provided  the  mentally  retarded  plaintiffs  only  separate,  segregated \ninstitutionalized services, that insufficient services were provided to the most severely disabled based on the severity of their \ndisability, and that the lack of community based services furthered a policy of discrimination and segregation, all in violation \nof Section 504. Homeward Bound, at *20-21. The court ordered the State of Oklahoma to develop community based services \nfor the retarded *16 residents of Hissom so as to deinstitutionalize many needlessly subjected to the dehumanizing and \ndangerous conditions present at Hissom. Homeward Bound, at *22. \n  \nThe express recognition of the basic nature of community based services for the disabled in Homeward Bound directly \naddresses the plight of the plaintiff class. However, unlike Homeward Bound, plaintiffs in this case do not request the State to \ndevelop an entirely new program but to include all qualified handicapped individuals, which by definition includes the \nmentally ill, in the current HCBS program as required by Section 504. \n  \nThe plain meaning of Section 504 and its implementing regulations, as well as the cases construing Section 504, lead to the \nsame compelling conclusions: (1) the State’s exclusion of plaintiffs from participation in Colorado’s HCBS program is based \nsolely on the nature of their handicap; and (2) such denial is clearly prohibited by Section 504. \n  \nC. This Court’s Prior Ruling That Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 Did Not Apply to the HCBS Program \nRelied on Authority Overturned By the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987. \nThis Court recognized in its Order dated April 20, 1992 that the State receives federal funds for the HCBS program at issue. \nSlip op. at 4, 30. However the Court reasoned the anti-discrimination provisions of Section 504 were not triggered because \n10 \n \n\n \n \n \nDuc VAN LE, on behalf of himself and the class of..., 1992 WL 12037091...   \n \n \nthe State did not currently receive federal funds specifically earmarked for the mentally ill. As authority the Court relied on \nUnited States Dep’t of Transp. v. Paralyzed Veterans of America, 477 U.S. 597, 605-06 (1986) and held that *17 Section \n504 only applied to individual programs actually receiving federal funds, not the overall agency or institution. Slip op. at 29. \nHowever, in the passage quoted, the Court omitted a section of Paralyzed Veterans which indicated its express reliance on \nthe rationale of  Grove City College v. Bell, 465 U.S. 555 (1984). \n  \nCongress expressly overruled Grove City College and therefore Paralyzed Veterans through passage of the Civil Rights \nRestoration Act of 1987, Pub. L. No. 100-259, 102 Stat. 28 (codified as amended at 20 U.S.C. § 1687 (1988) (“Civil Rights \nAct”). S. Rep. No. 64, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 3-4 (1987). The purpose of the Civil Rights Act was “to overturn the Supreme \nCourt’s 1984 decision in Grove City College” and further, inter alia, to clarify application and coverage of Section 504. S. \nRep. No. 64, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 3 (1987). Congress intended the anti-discrimination constraints of Section 504 to apply \nbroadly to an entire institution or agency, any part of which receives federal funding. S. Rep. No. 64, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. \n8-9 (1987). \n  \nTherefore this Court’s reading of the scope of Section 504 mistakenly relied on overruled authority. As the State and this \nCourt both recognize the HCBS program is federally funded, Section 504 therefore manifestly applies, and the State may not \ndiscriminate on the basis of disability but must extend plaintiffs the same benefits currently offered the elderly, blind, and \nphysically disabled. \n  \nII. THE DISTRICT COURT CORRECTLY RULED THAT THE MENTALLY ILL ARE A SUSPECT CLASS \nUNDER THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE. \nA. The Mentally Disabled as a Discrete Group Inherently Constitute a Suspect Class Under the Criteria *18 Established \nin  Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307 (1976). \nIn  Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307 (1976) the Supreme Court of the United States set out the \ncharacteristics of a suspect class for purposes of equal protection analysis under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution. In Murgia, Massachusetts retired a fifty year old state policeman as required by state statute. In response \nthe plaintiff sued the state, alleging the mandatory retirement statute denied him equal protection of the laws in violation of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment.  Murgia, 427 U.S. at 308-09. The Murgia court held that legislative classifications require \nstrict scrutiny on judicial review only when the “classification impermissibly interferes with the exercise of a fundamental \nright or operates to the peculiar disadvantage of a suspect class.” Id. at 312. The Court concluded that the plaintiff was neither \na member of a suspect class, nor denied the exercise of a fundamental right, and held that the forced retirement statute passed \nmuster under the Equal Protection Clause as it furthered a rational governmental interest in maintaining a physically fit police \nforce for public benefit. Id. at 314-15 (Marshall, J., dissenting). \n  \nThe Murgia court framed the following factors as identifying a suspect class: “[A] suspect class is one ‘saddled with such \ndisabilities, or subjected to such a history of purposeful unequal treatment, or relegated to such a position of political \npowerlessness as to command extraordinary protection from the *19 majoritarian political process.’ ” Id. at 313 (quoting \nSan Antonio School District v. Rodriquez, 411 U.S. 1, 28 (1973)). A suspect class may be subjected to disabilities due to \n“stereotyped characteristics not truly indicative of their abilities.” Id. Additionally a suspect class constitutes a “discrete and \ninsular” group within society. Id. (quoting  United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U.S. 144, 152-53, n.4 (1938)). \n  \nThis Court relied on Murgia in  Lujan v. Colorado State Bd. of Educ., 649 P.2d 1005 (Colo. 1982). This Court ruled that \nthe state’s public school financing system did not create a wealth-based suspect class of school children and therefore the \nsystem was constitutional as it rationally furthered a legitimate state interest. Id. at 1025. In its analysis, this Court examined \nthe characteristics of the plaintiff class of school children and determined the absence of Murgia suspect class factors \n11 \n \n\n \n \n \nDuc VAN LE, on behalf of himself and the class of..., 1992 WL 12037091...   \n \n \nprecluded suspect class status. Id. at 1020-22. The identifying characteristics which this Court sought as evidence of a suspect \nclass were a “group marked by common attributes or characteristics,” an identifiably distinct and insular class, “a history of \npurposeful unequal treatment with its attendant disabilities,” and a “position of political powerlessness as to command \nextraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process.” Id. at 1020-21. \n  \n1. The Severe Mentally Ill are Saddled With Such Disabilities As to Command Extraordinary Protection. \nThe severe mentally ill as a discrete group constitute a suspect class under the Murgia test adopted by this Court in *20 \nLujan. It is undeniable the mentally ill are “saddled with such disabilities” they have difficulty surviving in an often \nindifferent society. The inability of the mentally ill to cope with everyday life forces them in to an endless cycle of \nhospitalization,  nursing  home  placement,  community  placement,  destabilization  and  subsequent  reinstitutionalization. \nStipulation 45 (R. Vol. 2, p. 264; R. Vol. 4, p. 36). Those who escape the revolving door syndrome become isolated in dismal \nboarding houses, homeless shelters, or another of America’s burgeoning population of the homeless mentally ill. See. e.g., \nNewel, supra. The low social status and bizarre behavior of the mentally ill often foster contempt among those who treat \nthem in isolated institutional settings, further aggravating disabilities over which the victims have no control. \n  \nPopular  conceptions  stereotype  the  mentally  ill  in  a  manner  not  indicative  of  their  true  abilities.  The  “shadow  of \ndemonology” has plagued the treatment and popular view of the mentally ill until comparatively recently. Herschel A. Prins, \nAttitudes Towards the Mentally Disordered, 24 Med. Sci. Law. 181, 183 (1984). The Homeward Bound court recognized that \nsocial prejudice against the mentally retarded fostered segregated treatment in isolated institutions with abysmal conditions. \nHomeward Bound at *8. The same unfortunate social prejudice extends to the mentally ill, sequestered in institutions away \nfrom the public eye. Although past stereotypes maintain the mentally ill should be hidden away with other mentally impaired \nindividuals, this institutional gulag is increasingly seen as *21 ineffective, inhumane, and even immoral. Homeward Bound, \nat *16-18. Community based care is the revolution dignifying care of the mentally disabled. See, e.g. Cockerham, supra, at \n27-28. The philosophy of community based care rejects the popular stereotype of the insane and recognizes the mentally ill as \ndisabled individuals, who are able to live in society with dignity and enjoy relationships with others. \n  \n2. The Severe Mentally Ill Have Suffered a History of Purposeful Unequal Treatment. \nPrior to the growth of institutions in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, mentally ill individuals were often locked in tiny \ncells or driven from their community by a frightened population. The rise of institutions segregated the mentally ill in distant \nlocations, often with violent criminals. The institutions were not maintained as places of treatment, but places of custody for \nthe mentally ill. Institutional conditions lead nineteenth century reformers such as Dorthea Dix to campaign for moral \ntreatment. However moral treatment was short lived in under-funded, isolated institutions, especially the large state hospitals. \nSee, e.g. Thomas S. Szasz, M.D., The Age of Madness. The History of Involuntary Mental Hospitalization (1973). \n  \nThis institutionalization purposefully denied the mentally ill their basic right to exist in a community, free of restraint. \nWithout community based services, the only available treatment is within the confines of the institution. The complete \nabsence of treatment alternatives which foster personal dignity continues the societal history of purposeful and unequal \ntreatment of the *22 mentally ill. The district court recognized the State, in a purposeful and unequal manner, violated \nplaintiffs’ fundamental liberty interest in living free from restrictive institutional confines by refusing to extend to them the \nsame HCBS benefits currently offered other disabled individuals. Slip op. at 13. \n  \n3. The Severe Mentally Ill Are Relegated to a Position of Political Powerlessness Within Society. \nThe unique nature of the disability of the mentally ill is that the underlying impairment operates at a level and by means \ndifficult to fathom from the perspective of the majority. The chronic nature of their illness is marked by a constant struggle to \n12 \n \n\n \n \n \nDuc VAN LE, on behalf of himself and the class of..., 1992 WL 12037091...   \n \n \ncope with everyday life, to accomplish the basics of daily living and to process information essential to their basic \nfunctioning. This struggle remains unknown by society because mentally ill persons are put away and in different ways kept \nsilent. Mentally ill individuals require continued assistance in personal care, homemaker services, and medication monitoring \nin order to survive in the community. Stipulations 40-43 (R. Vol. 3, pp. 263-264). When a class of individuals, living in such \nenforced isolation, requires such effort and assistance to meet such basic needs, it is apparent how completely unattainable is \nviable participation in our pluralistic political process. Therefore the courts should protect the interests and rights of the \nmentally ill as they are truly unable to do it themselves within our political process. \n  \nIn summary, the mentally ill possess the characteristics of a suspect class as identified in Murgia and applied by this Court in \n*23 Lujan. The disabilities and vulnerabilities of the mentally ill have subjected them to an unfortunate history of fear, \nconfinement, and marginalization in institutions. This purposeful separate and unequal treatment of the mentally ill persists \nwhile other disabled individuals are treated in humane and dignified community settings similar to the HCBS program at \nissue. Societal stereotypes falsely depict the mentally ill as suited solely for life in an institution. The State perpetuates these \nstereotypes as a matter of policy by refusing to provide plaintiffs the care in a community treatment setting to which they are \nentitled. \n  \nB. The Legislative History of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 Considered With Section 504 Demonstrates \nIndisputable Congressional Recognition that the Mentally Disabled Are a Suspect Class Deserving the Judicial Protection \nWhich Strict Scrutiny Ensures. \nPresident Bush signed the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C.A. §§ 12101-12213 (West 1992) (“ADA”) on \nJuly 26, 1990, 28 days before the trial court’s Decision and Order of August 23, 1990. Congress declared the purpose of the \nADA with resounding national conviction and commitment: \nIt is the purpose of this Act: \n  \n(1) to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with \ndisabilities; \n  \n(2) to provide clear, strong, consistent, enforceable standards addressing discrimination against individuals with disabilities; \n  \n(3) to ensure that the Federal Government plays a central role in enforcing the standards established in this Act on behalf of \nindividuals with disabilities; and \n  \n(4) to invoke the sweep of congressional authority, including the power to enforce the fourteenth amendment and to regulate \ncommerce, in order to address the major areas of discrimination faced day-to-day by people with disabilities. \n  \n  \n42 U.S.C.A. § 12101(b)(West 1992)(emphasis added). \n  \n*24 As is evident from the underscored portion, Congress expressly referenced the Fourteenth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution. This statement, when viewed in light of both the legislative history of the ADA and its statutory content, \ndemonstrates clear Congressional intent to recognize the disabled, including the mentally ill, as a suspect class for purposes \nof equal protection. \n  \nIn its findings of fact Congress expressly described the disabled in language almost identical to that used by the United States \nSupreme Court to describe the criteria of a suspect class in  Murgia, 427 U.S. 307. \n(7) individuals with disabilities are a discrete and insular minority who have been faced with restriction \nand limitations, subjected to a history of purposeful unequal treatment, and relegated to a position of \npolitical powerlessness in our society, based on characteristics that are beyond the control of such \n13 \n \n\n \n \n \nDuc VAN LE, on behalf of himself and the class of..., 1992 WL 12037091...   \n \n \nindividuals and resulting from stereotypic assumptions not truly indicative of the individual ability of \nsuch individuals to participate in, and contribute to, society \n  \n  \n42 U.S.C.A. § 12101(a)(7)(West 1992). The intention of Congress by virtue of the plain language of the ADA is certain: the \ndisabled constitute a suspect class for purposes of equal protection. The ADA recognizes the unequal, inferior status of and \nthe discrimination directed against the disabled in society and remedies the situation with statutory authority that expressly \ndescribes the disabled as a group inherently constituting a suspect class, necessarily deserving the extraordinary judicial \nprotection ensured by applying the compelling interest, strict scrutiny test to justify state action. \n  \n*25 The legislative history of the ADA directly supports this conclusion. The House Committee on Education and Labor also \nexpressly used the terms and concepts of Murgia: \nAs the summary of the testimony before the committee demonstrates, the unfortunate truth is that \nindividuals with disabilities are a discreet, specific minority, who have been insulated in many respects \nfrom the general public. Such individuals have been faced with a range of restrictions and limitations in \ntheir lives. Further, they have been subjected to unequal and discriminatory treatment in a range of areas, \nbased on characteristics that are beyond the control of such individuals and resulting from stereotypical \nassumptions, fears and myths not truly indicative of the ability of such individuals to participate in and \ncontribute to society. Finally such individuals have often not had the political power and muscle to \ndemand the protections that are rightfully theirs. The simple fact that this Act has taken this long to pass \nCongress, twenty-five years after the other civil rights legislation has been passed, is a testimony to the \nfact. \n  \n  \nH.R. Rep No. 485, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 3, at 322 (1990). \n  \nThe Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources wrote the major report on the ADA for the Senate. The report \nconducted extensive findings and in conclusion also described the disabled in Murgia suspect class terms: \nIn sum, the unfortunate truth is that individuals with disabilities are a discrete and insular minority who \nhave been faced with restrictions and limitations, subjected to a history of purposeful unequal treatment, \nand relegated to a position of political powerlessness in our society, based on characteristics that are \nbeyond the control of such individuals and resulting from stereotypic assumptions not truly indicative of \nthe ability of such individuals to participate in and contribute to society. \n  \n  \nS. Rep. No. 116, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 15 (1989). The conclusion is inescapable: in the ADA Congress recognized the \ndisabled, including the mentally ill, as a suspect class. Therefore enactment of the ADA confirmed that plaintiffs are a \nsuspect  class,  entitled  to  special  judicial  protection  by  requiring  the    *26  strict  scrutiny  analysis  and  compelling \ngovernmental interest test to justify the State’s discriminatory action. \n  \nThat the ADA recognized the suspect class status of the disabled comports with the policy of Section 504. Since Section 504 \nand the ADA share the common purpose to protect the same class of individuals from discrimination on the basis of \ndisability, both statutes should be read harmoniously. The ADA corroborates an express Congressional mandate that the \ndisabled are a suspect class. Logically, if the ADA and Section 504 are to be read harmoniously, Duc Van Le and the plaintiff \n14 \n \n\n \n \n \nDuc VAN LE, on behalf of himself and the class of..., 1992 WL 12037091...   \n \n \nclass constitute a suspect class under both statutes. \n  \nC. On the Basis of the Stipulated Facts and District Court Findings of Fact the State Has Failed to Demonstrate a \nCompelling Governmental Interest In Withholding HCBS Benefits From Duc Van Le and the Plaintiff Class. \nOrdinarily, in order to pass judicial review under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, government \naction or legislative classification merely must further some rational governmental interest.  Murgia, 427 U.S. at 314. \nHowever, if the classification operates to the disadvantage of a suspect class or adversely affects the exercise of a \nfundamental right, then equal protection analysis requires strict scrutiny. Id. at 312. In order to pass muster under strict \nscrutiny, a legislative classification affecting a suspect class must further a compelling government interest.  Cleburne v. \nCleburne Living Center, 473 U.S. 432, 440 (1984). \n  \nAs demonstrated above, this Court should find that the mentally ill constitute a suspect class. For these reasons, in *27 order \nfor the denial to be sustained, this Court must determine that the State’s denial of HCBS benefits to the mentally ill based \nsolely on the nature of their disabilities furthers a compelling government interest. \n  \nAlthough plaintiffs require the same HCBS benefits the State currently provides the elderly, blind, and physically disabled, \nthe State refuses to reapply for a mentally ill HCBS waiver from the federal government. Stipulation 35 (R. Vol. 2, p. 263; \nVol. 4, p. 132) The district court in its findings of fact stated the State made no attempt to correct its rejected 1985 waiver. \nSlip op. at 3. \n  \nThe district court found that the State’s cost of providing HCBS services to the mentally ill would be significantly less than \nthe cost of continued hospitalization for the low income mentally ill. In fact HCBS services average $46.00 daily while \nhospitalization costs $400.00 daily. Slip op. at 3. As the federal government pays 50% to 75% of the cost of the HCBS \nprogram, the State’s financial burden is clearly lower in a HCBS program. \n  \nDespite the obvious need for HCBS services, the State has not exercised reasonable diligence in seeking out existing federal \nfunding for services for the mentally ill. Stipulations 35, 51 and 52 (R. Vol. 2, pp. 263, 265; R. Vol. 4, p. 132). In fact the \nState is currently underspending its federal funding for the current HCBS program, the same program from which plaintiffs \nare excluded solely on the basis of their mental disability. (R. Vol. 4, p. 41). \n  \n*28 Against these facts, the State’s denial of HCBS benefits to plaintiffs, otherwise qualified handicapped individuals within \nthe meaning of Section 504, furthers no compelling State interest and fails the strict scrutiny test. Quite to the contrary, the \noverwhelming evidence is that the State’s interest is best served by providing plaintiffs access to a more economically \nefficient HCBS program. Such care fosters the same dignity and humanitarian treatment of the mentally ill as is provided \nother eligible persons under the HCBS program, in a manner consistent with the mandate of the ADA and Section 504. \n  \nIn summary, because Duc Van Le and the plaintiff class constitute a suspect class, the State is required to establish a \ncompelling State interest justifying its denying them HCBS benefits. The State has failed this requirement. This Court \ntherefore must determine that the State’s denial of HCBS benefits to plaintiffs violates plaintiffs’ rights to the equal \nprotection of the laws. \n  \nCONCLUSION \nThe State violated plaintiffs’ rights under Section 504 by denying them HCBS benefits offered to elderly, blind and \nphysically disabled individuals based solely on the nature of plaintiffs’ disability. Plaintiffs are entitled to HCBS benefits \nunder the plain meaning of Section 504, as well as the judicial decisions interpreting Section 504. The authority previously \nrelied on by this Court to prevent application of the anti-discrimination provisions of Section 504 was expressly overruled by \n15 \n \n\n \n \n \nDuc VAN LE, on behalf of himself and the class of..., 1992 WL 12037091...   \n \n \nCongress. \n  \n*29 Additionally, under the criteria identified in Murgia, supra, and the available evidence in this case, plaintiffs constitute a \nsuspect class for purposes of determining their rights to equal protection of the laws. Similarly, in the ADA Congress \nrecognized that the disabled, including the severe mentally ill, such as the plaintiff class possess the special characteristics of \na suspect class under the Fourteenth Amendment. Such persons warrant extraordinary judicial vigilance to protect their legal \nrights due to their severe disabilities, political powerlessness, and the historical discrimination against them. The State’s \ndenial of HCBS benefits only furthers a history of discrimination against the mentally ill. \n  \nFor these reasons, this Court should affirm the Order of the District Court. \n  \nFootnotes \n \n1  The application of section 504 is limited to those classes of handicapped individuals authorized by statute for participation in the \n  individual program. 45 C.F.R. 84.4(c). This exception is not applicable in this case. The broad anti-discrimination protection \nprovided by section 504 extends to the plaintiffs because section 1915(c) of the Social Security Act, through its implementing \nregulations, authorizes the HCBS program at issue for participation by the elderly, blind, physically disabled, mentally ill, and \ndevelopmentally disabled. 42 C.F.R. 441.301(b)(6)(emphasis added). \n \n \n   \n \n \n16 \n ",

Ibarra, Executive Director of the Colorado De-\npartmentofSocialServices(“DSS”)herebyrespondtotheselegalarguments.\nA.NostateoffersHCBStoadultmentallyillpatients.\nPetitioner concedes (combined Answer Brief, p. 7) that “only one state has a waiver program for mentally ill\npersons.”Thisconcession,however,isdisingenuousandpetitionerfailsto*2acknowledgetheobvioussignific-\nanceoftheconcession.\nFirst, the only state offering HCBS services to the mentally ill is Vermont (r. 354) and it only offers services to\nchildren (tr. 114). Federal funds are available for services rendered to children in an institution for mental dis-\nease (“IMD”) but not for adults. 42 U.S.C.S. § 1396d(a)(4)(A) and (15) ( 1985 & 1990 Supp.). The Vermont\nHCBS program is therefore not relevant to this case, and if petitioner was candid he would admit that no state\noffersHCBStotheclassofmentallyilladultswhichherepresents.\nNext, petitioner attempts to minimize this concession by saying (Combined Answer Brief, p. 7) “There are a\nnumber of reasons for this fact [i.e. no state offers HCBS to the mentally ill] ... (e.g.) many states have more\ngenerous basic medicaid programs than Colorado.” This argument actually makes DSS's point. As was noted in\nDSS's Opening Brief (pp. 12, 16), there are many possible ways to attack the problem of providing appropriate\nservicestothementallyill.Petitioner,however,assumestheequalprotectionclauseand§504mandateoneand\nonly one solution to the program: i.e. Colorado must provide the same HCBS to the mentally ill as it does to the\nelderly,blindandphysicallydisabled.Inreality,therearemanysolutionstotheproblem,including,interalia,a\nmoregenerousbasicmedicaidprogram.Thelegislativebranch,andnottheCourts,is*3theappropriatebodyto\n©2011ThomsonReuters.NoClaimtoOrig.USGov.Works.\n\n1991WL11034408(Colo.)

If it is irrational, the same irrationality has seized every other state faced with the\nsame choice. Petitioner also urges that federal funding is readily available for HCBS for the mentally ill. If it is\nreadilyavailable,everyotherstatehasneglectedtoavailitselfofthisreadysourceoffunds.\nB.FederalregulationsrequirestatestolimitHCBStospecifictargetgroups.\nPetitioner admits (combined Answer Brief p. 9) that “Federal regulations governing the HCBS program limit\nwaiverrequeststooneofthree‘targetgroups.’...”Onceagain,however,petitionerattemptstominimizethisad-\nmissionanddoesnotsquarelyfacetheconsequencesofthisadmission.\nFirst, petitioner disparages the Federal requirement as a mere “procedural regulation.” Whether the requirement\nis viewed as procedural or substantive, it shows the Federal government anticipates a state may elect to serve\none target group and not another, or a state may offer a package of HCB services to one *4 group and very dif-\nferent package to another group. Moreover, the regulation recognizes the physically disabled have different\nneedsandcharacteristicsthanthementallyillandstateagenciesshoulddevelopdifferentprogramsforeachtar-\nget group. The Federal regulation, 42 C.F.R. § 441.301(b)(6) (1989) harmonizes with the Federal statute, 42\nU.S.C.S. § 1396n(c)(7) (Supp. 1990), which allows HCBS programs to be limited to “to individuals with a par-\nticular illness or condition....” In sum, the Federal regulations and statutes show HCBS can be offered to one\ngroupandnotanother,andshowitisrationaltodistinguishbetweenthetargetgroups.\nC.TheFederalgovernmentwillnotauthorizeanHCBSprogramformentallyilladults,andinanyevent,Color-\nado'sdecisionnottoapplyforawaivertooffersuchaprogramisnottheissueinthiscase.\nThe court below found (r. 565) that Federal Funds were available to provide HCBS to mentally ill adults. DSS\nsubmits this finding is contrary to the weight of the evidence presented at trial, and in any event is irrelevant to\ntheissuespresentedinthiscase.\nThe evidence at trial shows: (1) Colorado applied twice for a waiver renewal to offer HCBS to mentally ill\nadults, and the Federal government denied both requests, (2) no state currently*5 has Federal approval to offer\nHCBStomentallyilladults,and(3)FederalofficialshavetoldstateofficialsthatarequestforFederalFundsto\noffer HCBS to mentally ill adults would have “a snowball's chance in hell.” These facts lead inevitably to the\nconclusion Federal Funds are not available. Against these facts, petitioner can only cite HCFA's letter saying an\napplicationforfederalfundswouldbesubjectto“thesamestandards”asanapplicationforFederalFundstoof-\nfer HCBS to the physically disabled. As pointed out in DSS's opening brief (pp. 6-7, 10), Federal restrictions on\nfunding for services for the mentally ill mean that the “same standards” necessarily doom a request for Federal\nFundstofailureifitisforHCBSformentallyilladults.\nInanyevent,Colorado'sinabilitytoobtainsuchawaiverisbesidethepointinthiscase.Petitionerdoesnotseek\nan order directing Colorado to apply for a waiver authorizing HCBS for the mentally ill.

Page3\ning in the HCBS-*6 EBD program and, under the district court's decision, DSS would be required to allow such\nparticipation. Accordingly, any discussion of whether Colorado could obtain Federal Funds for other waivers is\nbeside the point; the issue presented here is whether petitioner and his class are eligible for a program designed\nforthephysicallydisabled.\nD.TheGeneralAssemblyexpresslyrepealedthestatutoryauthoritytoofferHCBStothementallyill.\nPetitioneradmits(combinedAnswerBrief,p.5),butdoesnotdealwith,therepealofthestatestatutesauthoriz-\ning HCBS for the mentally ill. The repeal, however, makes it quite clear that: (1) The General Assembly is\naware of the problems in finding Federal funds to provide services to this population and (2) The General As-\nsembly is seeking methods other than an HCBS medicaid waiver to provide home based services to this popula-\ntion. The General Assembly's action should also be viewed in light of the contemporaneous adoption of the re-\nhabilitation option program (§ 26-4-105(1)(t), C.R.S. (1990 Supp.)) which provides needed services to the adult\nmentallyillpopulation.\n*7ARGUMENT\nI.\nPROVIDINGHCBS-EBDTOTHEELDERLY,BLINDANDPHYSICALLYDISABLEDWITHOUT\nPROVIDINGEXACTLYTHESAMESERVICESTOOTHERNEEDYGROUPSDOESNOTVIOLATE\nCONSTITUTIONALGUARANTEESOFEQUALPROTECTION.\nPetitioner contends that: (1) The mentally ill are a suspect class for equal protection purposes (Combined An-\nswer Brief, pp. 21-24), (2) This case involves a fundamental liberty interest (Combined Answer Brief, pp.\n24-29), and (3) There is no rational basis for distinguishing between the physically disabled and mentally dis-\nabled(CombinedAnswerBrief,pp.29-32).Noneofthesecontentionsarepersuasive.\nFirst, this case does does not involve a suspect class. As pointed out in DSS's opening brief, there is no reported\ncase holding the mentally ill are a suspect class. In response, petitioner can only urge that the preamble to the\nAmericansWithDisabilitiesAct,Pub.L.101-336,§2(July26,1990),(“ADA”)transformsallpersonswithany\nkind of disability into a member of a suspect class. This argument is without merit. First, no substantive provi-\nsionsoftheADAapplytothefactsofthiscase.Second,thereisnohintintheADAoritslegislativehistorythat\nCongress intended to change any judicial decisions concerning “suspect classes” or equal protection jurispru-\ndence.*8Third,theADAapplieswithequalforcetoboththephysicallydisabledandthementallydisabled,and\nyet petitioner's claim in this case is that DSS has discriminated against him and in favor of the physically dis-\nabled. Finally, the mentally ill cannot be considered a suspect class unless laws relating to the mentally ill are\n“likely to reflect deep seated prejudice rather than legislative rationality....” Cunningham v. Beavers, 858 F.2d\n269,273(5thCir.1988), cert.denied,109S.Ct.1343(1989).Lawsrelatingtothementallyill,however,gener-\nallyshowsolicitudeforthementallyillandprovideservicesforthisgroupnotprovidedtothepopulationgener-\nally.Accordingly,thecourtshaveheldandcontinuetoholdthatdisability,includingmentalillness,isnotasus-\npect classification. See D'Amato v. Wisconsin Gas Co., 760 F.2d 1474, 1486-1487 (7th Cir. 1985); Pendleton v.\nJeffersonLocalSchoolDistrict,754F.Supp.570(S.D.Ohio1990).\nSimilarly,thiscasedoesnotinvolveafundamentalinterest.Petitionerattemptstoequatethefactsofthiscaseto\ncases such as Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982), where the state has acted to place individuals in insti-\ntutions. In this case, however, DSS has taken no action to place anyone in an institution. Petitioner asserts the\n©2011ThomsonReuters.NoClaimtoOrig.USGov.Works.\n\n1991WL11034408(Colo.) Page4\nequalprotectionclauseburdenstheStatewithanaffirmativedutytoprovideservicestopreventinstitutionaliza-\ntion of its citizens. No such duty *9 exists, and petitioner has cited no case where the courts have imposed such\na duty. For example, petitioner relies on Thomas S. by Brooks v. Flaherty, 699 F. Supp. 1178 (W.D.N.C. 1988).\nThis decision was affirmed in a decision reported as Thomas S. by Brooks v. Flaherty, 902 F.2d 250 (4th Cir.\n1990). As the appellate decision makes clear, the court was only dealing with deficient treatment of patients in\nstatehospitals,notwithimposingadutyonthestatetoprovideservicestoavoidhospitalization.\nFinally, there is a rational basis for distinguishing between the physically disabled and the mentally ill. It is\nmore difficult to attract Federal funding for services for the mentally ill. The mentally ill often require active\ntreatment for their mental illness which is different from and in addition to services provided to the physically\ndisabled. 42 U.S.C.S. § 1395r(b)(3)(F)(i) (1990 Supp.). See also Doe v. Colautti, 592 F.2d 704 (3d Cir. 1979);\nBernard B. v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Greater New York, 528 F. Supp. 125 (S.D.N.Y. 1981). Finally, the\nchoice “to remedy one phase of a social problem while neglecting others is Rot inconsistent with the mandates\nofequalprotection....”Kingv.Schweiker,647F.2d541,547(5thCir.1981)(footnotesomitted).\nThe case most nearly on point with the equal protection issues presented here is Beckwith v. Kizer, 912 F.2d\n1139 (9th Cir. 1990). Petitioner's attempt to distinguish Beckwith is not *10 impressive. First, petitioner asserts\n(CombinedAnswerBrief,pp.32-33)thiscaseinvolvesasuspectclass.Asnotedabove,thereisnoreportedcase\ntosupportthisassertion.Second,petitioneravers(CombinedBrief,p.33)that,inBeckwith,thestaterestrictions\non HCBS were necessary for cost containment, while the restrictions are not necessary for cost containment\nhere.Thereisnobasisforthisclaimeddistinction.Forexample,theBeckwithcourtsaid:\nWe have no doubt that if California were now to ask for approval of its original proposal, or another proposal\nnot limited to individuals who enter its waiver program from a hospital, the secretary could not reject it on the\nsamegroundsthesecretaryusedin1987.\n912 F.2d at 1143 (emphasis supplied). In other words, the Court believed California could have made the re-\nquiredshowingofcostcontainmentandobtainedawaiverifithadchosentodoso.TheCourt,however,refused\ntosecondguessthestatesaying:\nDefinition of any waiver class necessarily involves difficult policy judgments concerning where services would\nmostefficientlybeused.WelackthequalificationsorauthoritytopassuponthefiscalresponsibilityofCalifor-\nnia'swaiverprograminthemannerplaintiffsrequest\n912F.2dat1144.Accordingly,thecourtallowedCaliforniatorestricttheclassofthoseeligibleforHCBSeven\nthough others might benefit from the services and it might be cost effective to offer the services to them.

If the need for care arises from physical disability, they are eligible\nfor HCBS-EBD. (Note, however, that Federal law requires such individuals to be screened to see if they also\nneed active treatment for their mental illness in addition to medicaid long term care services. 42 U.S.C.S.\n1396r(b)(3)(F)(i) (1990 Supp.)). The facts in this case, however, are clear that petitioner's need for services\narisesonlyfromhismentalillness.\nPetitioner continues to rely (Combined Brief, pp. 13-14) on *12 Homeward Bound Inc. v. Hissom Memorial\nCenter,No.85C437F(N.D.Okla.July24,1987)forthepropositionthat§504requiresastatetoprovideHCBS\nto DD clients, and by analogy, to mentally ill clients. Actually, Hissom only says that the underdevelopment of\ncommunity resources might be considered a continuation of discrimination already proved; Hissom does not say\n§ 504, of itself, requires states to provide HCBS. In any event, this Court specifically declined to follow Hissom\non this point and declined to hold that § 504 required a state to create new programs for disabled plaintiffs.\nGoebelv.ColoradoDepartmentofInstitutions,764P.2d785,804-805(Colo.1988).\nThe case most nearly on point on the § 504 issues presented here is not Hissom, but Knutzen v. Eben Ezer\nLutheran Housing Center, 815 F.2d 1343 (10th Cir. 1987). Petitioner's attempt to distinguish Knutzen are not\npersuasive. Petitioner claims there is no basis in the Federal medicaid statutes for distinguishing between the\nphysically disabled and the mentally ill, but the pertinent statute actually permit states to limit HCBS to\n“individuals with a particular illness or condition....” 42 U.S.C.S. 1396n(c)(7) (1990 Supp.). Actually, petitioner\nignores the gist of Knutzen, which is that § 504 is intended to allow individuals to participate in Federal pro-\ngrams in spite of their handicaps, not to allow individuals to receive benefits from every Federal program be-\ncause of their handicap. Petitioner has *13 cited no authority for the proposition that § 504 says a plaintiff with\nonetypeofdisabilitycanforcehiswayintoaprogramdesignedforpersonswithotherkindsofdisabilities.\nCONCLUSION\nBasedontheabovepointsandauthorities,thedecisionofthedistrictcourtshouldbereversedandthismatterre-\nmandedwithinstructionstodismisspetitioner'scomplaintwithprejudice.\nDuc VAN LE, on behalf of himself and the class of persons similarly situated, Petitioner, v.

Petitioners prevailed in the District Court. The \nAssistant Attorney Generals representing the appealing state defendants have authorized petitioner’s counsel to inform this \ncourt that respondents have no objection to this Court granting this Petition. Respondents’ opening briefs are not due in the \nCourt of Appeals until April 15, 1991. \n  \nINTRODUCTION \n  \nPetitioner Duc Van Le brought this action on behalf of himself and a class of all similarly situated persons. The class was \ncertified by the trial court and defined as including all: \n  \nLow income mentally ill residents of Colorado who, because of their mental illness, qualify for skilled *2 or intermediate \ncare under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, but who have been and are being deprived by the State of Colorado of home \nand community based services under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, solely on the basis of their mental illness, although \nsuch services are provided to physically disabled adults, and who claim that this deprivation violates their rights under the \nSocial Security Act, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. \n  \nThis action was filed in 1988 to challenge the conduct of the Executive Directors of the Colorado Department of Social \nServices and the Colorado Department of Institutions as well as the members of the Colorado Board of Social Services who \nsince 1985 have discriminated against petitioners by depriving them of Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) \nnecessary to meet their needs solely on the basis of petitioners’ mental disabilities. From 1982 to 1985 respondents did offer \nsuch services to class members under the identical federal waiver program involved in this case. \n  \nThe Trial Court issued its decision on August 23, 1990 in petitioners’ favor finding that the defendants had violated their \nrights under the federal and state Medicaid Acts, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Equal Protection and \ndue process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n  \n1 \n \n\n \n \n \nDuc VAN LE, on behalf of himself and the class of..., 1991 WL 11257337...   \n \n \nPursuant to these findings, the Court enjoined the state defendants from continuing to deny home and community based \nbenefits to petitioners solely on the basis that their primary diagnosis is mental illness, and ordered the state defendants to \nprovide the same home and community based services benefits to plaintiff and class members as the state is currently \nproviding  *3 to the elderly, blind, and physically disabled. The court below did, however, grant a post trial stay of its \njudgment awarding the class substantial equitable relief pending the outcome of appeals. \n  \n1. ADVISORY LISTING OF THE ISSUES TO BE PRESENTED FOR REVIEW \nOn November 9, 1990 defendants filed their Notice of Appeal. In this notice, at page 3, state defendants wrote that the issues \nthey will be raising on appeal are the following: \n  \n“a. Whether the equal protection clause forbids Colorado to offer particular services to physically disabled individuals \nwithout offering precisely the same services to the mentally ill. \n  \nb. Whether Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act forbids Colorado to offer particular services to the physically disabled \nindividuals without offering precisely the same services to the physically disabled.” \n  \n2. THE OPINION OR JUDGMENT OF THE DISTRICT COURT \nDefendants have appealed from the fourteen page Decision and Order of the District Court issued on 8/23/90 by the \nHonorable Edward E. Carelli as well as from his October 16, 1990 Order resolving all post trial motions. These rulings are \nincluded in the Appendix. Also included in the Appendix is the extensive, 57 paragraph Stipulated Facts agreed to by the \nparties prior to trial. This Stipulation was extensively referred to or quoted from by the District Court in its 8/23/90 Decision \nand Order. \n  \n3. GROUNDS ON WHICH JURISDICTION OF THE SUPREME COURT IS INVOKED \nAs demonstrated in the next two sections of this petition, this case meets each of the three alternative grounds for jurisdiction \nand the discretionary grant of certiorari to the Court of Appeals before judgment under C.A.R. 50(a)(1), (2), and (3). \nJurisdiction is also invoked pursuant to C.A.R. 21 and *4 Section 3, Article VI of the Colorado Constitution as well as C.R.S. \nSection 13-4-109(3). In the alternative to C.A.R. 50, petitioner requests that this Court grant appropriate procedural relief so \nas to allow for a direct review and an immediate determination by this Court of the issues raised by this Petition, including \nspecifically relief contemplated by the other sources of jurisdiction just cited. \n  \n4. STATEMENT OF THE CASE \n  \nAn accurate statement of this largely agreed upon or stipulated case is most readily obtained by reference to the extensive \npretrial Stipulated Facts agreed to by the parties and taken as true by the District Court for decisional purposes. \n  \nThe particular facts pertinent to understanding Duc Van Le’s individual history and claim are set forth in detail in Stipulated \nFacts 1-20. In essence these stipulations establish that this South Vietnamese refugee suffered severe emotional trauma as a \nresult of being precipitously separated from his family. This trauma led to severe depression with psychotic features \nculminating in a suicide attempt. Duc Van Le was placed in a nursing home and briefly in Fort Logan. He is a diagnosed \nparanoid schizophrenic. He has severe learning disabilities, speech impediments in his native language and has tartive \ndyskinesia -- a motor defect. He suffers from hallucinations, anxiety and depression, which have made him a danger to \nhimself and others. \n  \n2 \n \n\n \n \n \nDuc VAN LE, on behalf of himself and the class of..., 1991 WL 11257337...   \n \n \nIn August, 1988 Duc Van Le applied for HCBS services on the basis that he required 24 hour five days a week skilled \nnursing supervised care, just like all other HCBS recipients. Stipulation *5 12. His application was duly processed by the \nColorado Foundation for Medical Care (CFMC). As detailed in Stipulations 13 and 14, the CFMC concluded and the ALJ \nMoeller found that Duc Van Le met all the threshold medical requirements for Medicaid reimbursement for HCBS services \nand that he was also financially qualified for the HCBS program. \n  \nHowever, solely because Duc Van Le is mentally ill, the Colorado Department of Social Services, which previously (in 1985) \nhad terminated such benefits for the mentally ill, denied Medicaid reimbursement for HCBS for Duc Van Le. Stipulation 16. \n  \nDuc Van Le timely appealed and the ALJ ruled that, although he was medically and financially qualified for HCBS under the \nscreen performed by CFMC, there is no reimbursement for HCBS in Colorado for individuals designated as mentally ill. \nStipulation 19. \n  \nDefendants have also stipulated below that they have denied at least 28 individual class members HCBS services in addition \nto Duc Van Le since 1987. They also admitted that others, for whom they cannot locate records, have been similarly denied. \nThey further have stipulated that 635 persons whose primary diagnosis is mental illness currently live in skilled and \nintermediate nursing homes. Defendants have also acknowledged that their ?? termination of the HCBS program for mentally \nill persons has deterred class members from even applying. Stipulations 45-49. \n  \nDefendants have overtly admitted in Stipulation 45 that there is no alternative state program which provides for Duc Van Le \nand the class of mentally ill persons he represents, the same *6 HCBS services which are currently provided to elderly, blind \nand physically disabled persons. \n  \nOf critical import and as the District Court found, defendants have even stipulated that Duc Van Le and members of the \nplaintiff class by definition “meet all of the financial and medical screens for HCBS services” but are being denied these \nservices “solely on the basis that their primary diagnosis is mental illness.” Stipulation 46. Indeed appellants have agreed in \nStipulation 17 that if Duc Van Le’s admitted need for HCBS services “had been based on physical disability instead of \nmental disability, he would have been granted HCBS services.” \n  \nMost importantly here, and quite atypically from most equal protection and Section 504 type cases wherein the very opposite \nis urged in justification of the challenged discrimination, defendants have candidly agreed, as the court found at page 7 of his \nAugust 23, 1990 Decision, that the provision of HCBS services “would be of great benefit” to Duc Van Le and the class of \nmentally ill persons he represents. Indeed as Judge Carelli expressly noted at p. 7, based on Trial Exhibit 3, defendants have \nadmitted that such HCBS services are “essential to the care and treatment of the long term mentally ill population and to the \ncontainment of costs for skilled and intermediate nursing care for this population.” \n  \nDefendants further admitted and the Court below expressly found, that “under Section 1915(c) of the Social Security Act, \nthey could at any time submit a waiver request for the mentally ill population under which they could provide the very same \nservices that are currently being provided to the elderly, blind, *7 and physically disabled.” Stipulation 44. But instead of \ndoing so, although admittedly retaining the power to do so administratively even without such legislation, these defendants \nalso admitted that they and their counsel “drafted legislation and actively supported such legislation in the last term of the \nColorado Legislature to expressly repeal language in  C.R.S. 26-4.5-201 statutorily authorizing defendants to seek such \nbenefits, on behalf of mentally ill persons, from the federal government. Stipulation 51. This ostrich-like action was overtly \naimed at this lawsuit. Defendants admittedly have also refused to seek a waiver since 1985. \n  \nAlthough defendants urged the legislature to find that the federal government “would not approve Colorado’s HCBS waiver \nrequest for the mentally ill,” a finding an ill informed legislature made, they admit that in fact “no such communication from \nthe federal government was presented to the General Assembly.” Indeed, appellants admitted at trial that the last letter they \nreceived from the then federal Secretary of Health and Human Services concerning these issues was in 1985. In this 1985 \nletter, Secretary Heckler overtly acknowledged that HCBS is “authorized by Section 1915(c) of the Social Security Act to \neligible mentally ill persons.” See Stipulation 51. \n  \n3 \n \n\n \n \n \nDuc VAN LE, on behalf of himself and the class of..., 1991 WL 11257337...   \n \n \n??, defendents admitted below and the Court found that the current position of the U.S. Department of Health and Human \nServices regarding the ongoing availability of a Section 1915(c) HCBS waiver program for the mentally ill is reflected in \nExhibit 6 to the Trial Stipulations, a May 17, 1990 letter to Congresswoman Schroeder from the HHS federal HCFA *8 \nAdministrator responsible for such programs. This case critical document makes crystal clear that the 1915(c) waiver \nprogram still is “the basis for states requesting and securing approval of a home or community based services program for the \nmentally ill . . .” “who would otherwise require the level of care provided in a hospital, nursing facility or intermediate care \nfacility.” This letter also states that “there is no statutory prohibition to providing home and community based services for \nthe mentally ill” and the Court below so found. In this same letter, the HCFA administrator explained how Colorado \npreviously misused the program for the mentally ill and failed to meet waiver requirements. The HCFA administrator also \nmade clear to the Trial Court that “the Department applies the same standards to waivers for mentally ill as it does to all \nother requests for waivers.” \n  \nFinally, defendants stipulated and the court found that petitioners “are protected handicapped persons within the meaning of \n29 U.S.C. 794, which is popularly known as Section 504 and its implementing regulations and that the HCBS services, \ncurrently offered only to the elderly, blind, physically disabled and developmentally disabled, are substantially supported by \n“federal financial assistance.” Indeed the federal government pays “between 50% and 75% of the ?? programs under the \nMedicaid Title XIX program.” See Stipulated Facts 55, 56 and 28. The Court expressly found that substantial federal \nfinancial assistance is available for the mentally ill under the waiver program. \n  \nBased on all these and other stipulations as well as on the *9 documentary and testimonial evidence before it, the trial court \napplied and reached the legal conclusion that appellants had violated petitioners’ rights under  42 U.S.C. 1983, under Title \nXIX of the Social Security Act, under  29 U.S.C. 794 and under the due process and equal protection clauses of the United \nStates Constitution. In so holding the Court relied upon this Court’s related decision in Goebel v. Colo. Department of \nInstitutions, et al., 764 P.2d 785 and the cases cited therein, particularly Homeward Bound Inc. v. Hissom Memorial Center, \nNo. 85-C-437-E (N.D. Okla, July 24, 1987) and  Pushkin v. Board of Regents of the University of Colorado, 658 F.2d \n1372. Based thereon, the trial judge concluded that 504 had been violated and that: \n  \nThe State’s current administration of services clearly segregate mentally ill persons from other handicapped persons. By \nfailing to provide HCBS program services to mentally ill persons, the State has underdeveloped a community based services \nsystem  for  those  suffering  from  mental  illness,  which  perpetuates  past  discrimination  against  such  persons.  Such \ndiscrimination clearly violates plaintiff’s and class members’ rights under Section 504. \n  \nThe District Court also concluded in a well reasoned opinion that class members’ equal protection and due process rights \nwere equally violated under “rational basis”, “suspect class” and “fundamental right” analyses. \n  \nSpecifically the Court found at pp. 13-14 of its August 23, 1990 decision as to the constitutional issues that: \n  \nPhysically disabled persons and mentally ill persons are similarly situated with respect to the purposes of the Section 1915(c) \nwaiver statute. \n  \nThe mentally ill are a suspect class for equal protection purposes. \n  \nPlaintiff’s and class members’ interest in living *10 in a community setting, and being free from undue bodily restraint in \ninstitutional setting such as hospitals and nursing homes, is a fundamental liberty interest which is infringed by the State’s \nfailure to provide HCBS benefits to persons who are mentally ill. \n  \nOn the basis of the stipulated facts and evidence presented, state defendants have shown no compelling governmental interest \nto support the unequal and discriminatory treatment of plaintiff and class members in this case. \n  \nEven assuming that the denial of HCBS benefits to mentally ill persons does not involve a suspect class or a fundamental \nright or interest, state defendants have not shown that such denial of HCBS benefits is rationally related to any legitimate \n4 \n \n\n \n \n \nDuc VAN LE, on behalf of himself and the class of..., 1991 WL 11257337...   \n \n \ngovernmental interest. \n  \nTherefore, the State’s failure to provide HCBS benefits to mentally ill persons solely on the basis of the nature of their \nhandicap, i.e. mental illness, constitutes a violation of equal protection. \n  \nBased on these findings and conclusions the District Court held that: \n  \n. . . plaintiff Duc Van Le and members of the class, as previously certified, are entitled to meaningful access to the same \nHCBS program services which are currently provided to elderly, blind and physically disabled persons. \n  \nHe further ordered that: \n  \n1. State defendants, their agents and employees are permanently enjoined from denying plaintiff and class members HCBS \nbenefits solely on the basis that their primary diagnosis is mental illness. \n  \n2. So long as state defendants provide HCBS benefits to elderly, blind and physically disabled persons, they shall provide the \nsame services for plaintiff and class members \n  \nSee August 23 Decision, page ??. \n  \n5. ARGUMENTS IN SUPPORT OF ALLOWANCE OF THE WRIT \nAs this Court knows from its previous rulings in Goebel v. Colo. Department of Institutions, et. al., 764 P.2d 785, extensive \nefforts are required of the State defendants if the protective *11 laws concerning to the chronically mentally ill are to be made \nmeaningful. A second petition in the closely related Goebel case is also about to be filed with this Court pursuant to C.A.R. \n50 to review the latest round of lower court proceedings in that seminal case. \n  \nThis case clearly involves a number of matters “of substance not heretofore determined by the Supreme Court of Colorado . . \n.” within the purview of C.A.R. 50(a)(1). Additionally, upon the appeal now pending before the Court of Appeals, that court \nis being asked to decide a number of important questions of federal statutory and constitutional law, all of which questions \nhave not been, but should be, determined by the Supreme Court. From the findings and conclusions of the District Court \nabove reviewed and from this Court’s own 1988 extensive findings, holdings and analyses in the Goebel case, it also appears \nclear that this case is of such imperative public importance as to justify deviation from normal appellate processes and to \nrequire the earliest possible determination by this Court. \n  \nThe basic life necessities of hundreds of people are literally at stake. As the District Court expressly found at pp. 2-3 of the \nAugust 23, 1990 decision, the benefits at issue in this case involve: \n1. Personal care services, homemaker services, medication monitoring in the home, and non-medical transportation, which \nare services currently provided under the HCBS Program for the elderly, blind and physically disabled, are [also] services \nwhich are necessary to maintain plaintiff and class members in a stable condition in the community, and to avoid \ninstitutionalization of such persons in hospitals and nursing homes. \n  \n2. No public or private agency currently has *12 a program to provide these essential services to plaintiff and class members, \nalthough such services are provided by the Department of Social Services to elderly, blind and physically disabled adults \nwhose incomes and medical needs are virtually identical with those of plaintiff and class members. \n  \n3. Without these home and community based services, plaintiff and class members will continue to experience the revolving \ndoor  syndrome  of  hospitalization,  nursing  home  placement,  placement  in  the  community,  de-stabilization  and \nre-hospitalization. Thus, the availability of HCBS is an essential ingredient of normal living patterns for a substantial number \nof persons who are mentally ill. The failure to provide such services operates to exclude persons who are mentally ill from \nliving in the community, and to return them into more restrictive environments. \n5 \n \n\n \n \n \nDuc VAN LE, on behalf of himself and the class of..., 1991 WL 11257337...   \n \n \n  \n  \nPetitioners can not more cogently express the poignant urgency of this matter. \n  \nAlthough the District Court has emphatically ruled in their favor, the simple truth in this case is that since 1985 the certified \nclass of persons now before this Court have been illegally, intentionally and systematically excluded by defendants from the \navailable HCBS Federal Medicaid Waiver program. As a consequence, they have received no meaningful programatic relief \nin this baseline survival area for six years. A two year additional delay to complete two appeals would be unjust. The \ngranting of this petition is essential to timely vindicate class members’ rights. \n  \nJust as in the Goebel case ?? viewed in terms of the importance of the legal issues presented, the public policies implicated, \nor the basic human needs and suffering at stake, this case cries out for the invocation of this Court’s jurisdiction and the \nCourt is respectfully asked to grant this Petition and promptly hear the pending appeal. \n  \nAppendix not available. \n   \n \n \n6 \n ",

Worthington*, Assistant Attorney General, Human \nResources Section, Attorneys for Respondents, 1525 Sherman Street, 5th Floor, Denver, Colorado 80203, Telephone: \n866-5448. \n*1 Respondents, pursuant to C.A.R. 40, request that this Court grant a rehearing in this case, and as grounds therefore state: \n  \nI. \nTHERE ARE NO APPROPRIATED BUT UNSPENT FUNDS THAT COULD BE USED TO PURCHASE \nHCBS-EBD FOR THE MENTALLY ILL. \nThe Court may have believed that the General Assembly has appropriated sums that could have been spent for HCBS-EBD \nfor the mentally ill, but were for some reason not spent. Nothing could *2 be further from the truth. \n  \nThe  General  Assembly  no  longer  appropriates  money  for  specific  medicaid  programs.  Instead,  medicaid  funds  are \nappropriated as a single item. Thus, funds for the HCBS-EBD program, as for all other Medicaid programs, must come from \nthis  single  appropriation.  The  growth  of  the  Medicaid  appropriation  in  the  recent  past  has  been  nothing  less  than \nastronomical, and there are no unspent or discretionary funds in that appropriation. \n  \nA few figures will suffice to make this point. In fiscal year 1989, the General Assembly appropriated a little less than $450 \nmillion for Medicaid, an amount representing 10% of the state budget. Colo. Sess. Laws, ch. 1, part XXI, pp. 86, 91 (1988). \nBy fiscal year 1991, this amount had increased to over $665 million, an amount representing 13% of the state budget. Colo. \nSess. Laws, ch. 1, part XXI, pp. 83, 88 (1990). In the current fiscal year, this amount has increased to over $1.1 billion, \nrepresenting nearly 18% of the state budget. Colo. Sess. Laws, ch. 340, part XX, pp. 2639, 2648. \n  \nThese numbers demonstrate the increasing demand placed on the Medicaid program to provide more and more people with \nmore (and increasingly costly) services. This increasing demand has led the General Assembly to allocate an ever increasing \nshare of the state’s fiscal resources to Medicaid. The decision in this case requires the Medicaid program to provide services \n1 \n \n\n \n \n \nDUC VAN LE, on behalf of himself and the class of..., 1992 WL 12044268...   \n \n \nto yet another *3 group of needy individuals. At some point, we must face the reality that Medicaid cannot provide all needed \nservices to everyone, and that there are other legitimate demands on the limited financial resources of the taxpayers. \n  \nThe decision in this case prevents the General Assembly from performing one of its most basic Constitutional duties, that of \ndeciding how best to allocate scarce public funds. This is not a case where the General Assembly has appropriated funds and \nthe Executive Branch has refused to spend them. This is a case where the General Assembly has appropriated a significant \nportion of the state’s budget for medicaid, but the courts have declared it is not enough. \n  \nII. \nTHE DECISION IN THIS CASE REQUIRES RESPONDENTS TO DO MUCH MORE THAN SEEK A WAIVER. \nThe dissenting opinion to the withdrawn April 20, 1992 decision in this case argued that respondents violated the Equal \nProtection Clause and §504 by failing to seek a waiver to serve the mentally ill. Slip op. at 12, 17. Indeed, Petitioner’s \nSupplemental Reply Brief concludes by urging this Court to “require respondents to apply for a waiver from the federal \ngovernment that will allow the provision of HCBS services to the *4 mentally ill.” (Brief, p. 17). If the decision in this case \nmerely required respondents to apply for a waiver, it would not be very significant. Respondents would simply have to waste \nthe resources necessary to prepare the waiver request, and after the request was denied the case would be over. \n  \nThe decision, however, is more far reaching. It provides, without qualification, that: \nSo long as state defendants provide HCBS benefits to elderly, blind and physically disabled persons, they \nshall provide the same benefits for plaintiff and class members. \n  \n  \nThus, respondents must provide the same benefits to the mentally ill even if a waiver is not granted, even if matching federal \nfunds are not available, or indeed even if there are not sufficient state funds to purchase these additional services. \n  \nThe decision simply does not address itself to the difficult task of finding the funds to pay for the services, of deciding what \nservices or programs must be cut to pay for HCBS for the mentally ill. These difficult choices are usually reserved for the \nlegislature, but in this case, the court has offered almost no choice and has not looked beyond the narrow needs of the \npetitioners in this case to the broader problems of attempting to provide adequate health care to greatest number of needy \nindividuals. \n  \n*5 CONCLUSION \nBased on the above points, the Court should grant the petition to rehear this case and enter a decision on the merits. \n  \nFootnotes \n \n*  Counsel of Record. \n   \n \n   \n \n2 \n \n\n \n \n \nDUC VAN LE, on behalf of himself and the class of..., 1992 WL 12044268...   \n \n \n \n3 \n ",
