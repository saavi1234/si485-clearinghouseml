In view of the Court's current and anticipated future participation in protracted litigation, the reasonable amount of attorney fees will be determined by a supplemental Order of this Court. The Court DENIES 461 Defendant District of Columbia's Motion for Leave to File a Surreply, on the basis that no new issues have been raised in 455 plaintiffs' reply. See Lewis v. Rumsfeld, 154 F. Supp. 2d 56, 60 (D.D.C. 2001) (\"The standard for granting a leave to file a surreply is whether the party making the motion would be unable to contest matters presented to the court for the first time in the opposing party's reply.\"). Plaintiffs are admonished, however, that any future filings exceeding the page limits provided by the Local Rules will be stricken. Signed by Judge Emmet G. Sullivan on March 30, 2009. (lcegs4)"

In view of the hearing held on July 29, 2009, and upon consideration of all the matters discussed therein, the Court denies without prejudice the motions for sanctions, grants the Barham plaintiffs' motion to compel the FBI to conduct a name search, and grants the motion for leave to file a surreply in connection with that motion. Moreover, upon further reflection, the Court also denies without prejudice the individual officers' motions for judgment on the pleadings or, in the alternative, for summary judgment filed in the Chang action and denies as moot the motion for leave to file a surreply in connection with those motions. This case is referred to Magistrate Judge Alan Kay for resolution of what, if any, documents produced in camera in connection with the Chang plaintiffs' motions to compel should be produced to Chang plaintiffs; and for a report and recommendation on the amount of additional attorney fees and costs, if any, to which the Rule 68 plaintiffs in the Barham action are entitled. The parties are directed to read this Order in its entirety for further instructions. The Court will hold a status hearing on September 29, 2009 at 11:00 a.m. in Courtroom 24A.

During the status hearing held on January 26, 2010, the Court asked Stroz Friedberg to give a \"Scope and Sequence\" presentation to the Court on February 11, 2010 at 10:00 a.m. regarding its proposed duties and responsibilities as a forensic evaluation expert in this case. The purpose of the requested presentation is to provide an overview of the forensic evaluation work that can be done to address the issues raised by the report of retired United States District Court Judge Stanley Sporkin. In its presentation, the Court requests that Stroz Friedberg provide an overview of both \"Phase I\" and \"Phase II\" of its proposed services as set forth in the 579 joint submission of the Barham plaintiffs and the District of Columbia defendants on January 5, 2010, as well as cost projections for \"Phase II.\" The Court is sensitive to Stroz Friedberg's concern that it has not \"taken part in any engagements relating to this litigation and [that it has] limited knowledge [and] experience with the recordkeeping capabilities of the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department.\" Ex. 1 to Docket 579. Nevertheless, a presentation of the potential scope of duties - and the related costs - associated with \"Phase II\" is required to assist the Court in its consideration of whether to proceed with a Court-appointed forensic evaluation expert. It is FURTHER ORDERED that the District of Columbia shall file a memorandum of law on the issue of whether the Court may grant immunity to an expert appointed under Federal Rule of Evidence 706 by no later than February 4, 2010. In its memorandum, the District of Columbia shall address the propriety of granting absolute versus qualified immunity to a court-appointed expert. Responses shall be filed by no later than February 8, 2010. Signed by Judge Emmet G. Sullivan on January 27, 2010. (lcegs2 )"

In view of the hearing held on July 29, 2009, and upon consideration of all the matters discussed therein, the Court denies without prejudice the motions for sanctions, grants the Barham plaintiffs' motion to compel the FBI to conduct a name search, and grants the motion for leave to file a surreply in connection with that motion. Moreover, upon further reflection, the Court also denies without prejudice the individual officers' motions for judgment on the pleadings or, in the alternative, for summary judgment filed in the Chang action and denies as moot the motion for leave to file a surreply in connection with those motions. This case is referred to Magistrate Judge Alan Kay for resolution of what, if any, documents produced in camera in connection with the Chang plaintiffs' motions to compel should be produced to Chang plaintiffs; and for a report and recommendation on the amount of additional attorney fees and costs, if any, to which the Rule 68 plaintiffs in the Barham action are entitled. The parties are directed to read this Order in its entirety for further instructions. The Court will hold a status hearing on September 29, 2009 at 11:00 a.m. in Courtroom 24A.

No further responses or replies to the motion shall be filed. Signed by Judge Emmet G. Sullivan on September 3, 2010. (lcegs4)"

United States plaintiffs' motion for leave to file their objections to 595 the proposed settlement in Barham v. Ramsey on the public record. For the reasons stated on the record during the status hearing, the Chang plaintiffs are not bound by any portion of 595 the proposed class action settlement in Barham v. Ramsey, 02-2283. Accordingly, as the Chang plaintiffs admitted both in their written objections and during the status hearing on September 8, 2010, their objections to the proposed settlement are not properly before the Court. Nevertheless, in the interest of transparency and of preserving a complete record in this case, the Court concluded that the Chang objections should appear on the public record and directed Barham plaintiffs to re-file their response to the Chang plaintiffs' objections, and to include those objections as an attachment to the response. The Barham plaintiffs have done so, see 631 Response to Objections refiled pursuant to September 8, 2010 hearing. Accordingly, the relief requested in 626 has been GRANTED. Signed by Judge Emmet G. Sullivan on September 9, 2010. (lcegs4) Modified on 9/9/2010 (clv, )."

In view of the Court's current and anticipated future participation in protracted litigation, the reasonable amount of attorney fees will be determined by a supplemental Order of this Court. The Court DENIES 461 Defendant District of Columbia's Motion for Leave to File a Surreply, on the basis that no new issues have been raised in 455 plaintiffs' reply. See Lewis v. Rumsfeld, 154 F. Supp. 2d 56, 60 (D.D.C. 2001) (\"The standard for granting a leave to file a surreply is whether the party making the motion would be unable to contest matters presented to the court for the first time in the opposing party's reply.\"). Plaintiffs are admonished, however, that any future filings exceeding the page limits provided by the Local Rules will be stricken. Signed by Judge Emmet G. Sullivan on March 30, 2009. (lcegs4)"

During the status hearing held on January 26, 2010, the Court asked Stroz Friedberg to give a \"Scope and Sequence\" presentation to the Court on February 11, 2010 at 10:00 a.m. regarding its proposed duties and responsibilities as a forensic evaluation expert in this case. The purpose of the requested presentation is to provide an overview of the forensic evaluation work that can be done to address the issues raised by the report of retired United States District Court Judge Stanley Sporkin. In its presentation, the Court requests that Stroz Friedberg provide an overview of both \"Phase I\" and \"Phase II\" of its proposed services as set forth in the 579 joint submission of the Barham plaintiffs and the District of Columbia defendants on January 5, 2010, as well as cost projections for \"Phase II.\" The Court is sensitive to Stroz Friedberg's concern that it has not \"taken part in any engagements relating to this litigation and [that it has] limited knowledge [and] experience with the recordkeeping capabilities of the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department.\" Ex. 1 to Docket 579. Nevertheless, a presentation of the potential scope of duties - and the related costs - associated with \"Phase II\" is required to assist the Court in its consideration of whether to proceed with a Court-appointed forensic evaluation expert. It is FURTHER ORDERED that the District of Columbia shall file a memorandum of law on the issue of whether the Court may grant immunity to an expert appointed under Federal Rule of Evidence 706 by no later than February 4, 2010. In its memorandum, the District of Columbia shall address the propriety of granting absolute versus qualified immunity to a court-appointed expert. Responses shall be filed by no later than February 8, 2010. Signed by Judge Emmet G. Sullivan on January 27, 2010. (lcegs2 )"

United States plaintiffs' motion for leave to file their objections to 595 the proposed settlement in Barham v. Ramsey on the public record. For the reasons stated on the record during the status hearing, the Chang plaintiffs are not bound by any portion of 595 the proposed class action settlement in Barham v. Ramsey, 02-2283. Accordingly, as the Chang plaintiffs admitted both in their written objections and during the status hearing on September 8, 2010, their objections to the proposed settlement are not properly before the Court. Nevertheless, in the interest of transparency and of preserving a complete record in this case, the Court concluded that the Chang objections should appear on the public record and directed Barham plaintiffs to re-file their response to the Chang plaintiffs' objections, and to include those objections as an attachment to the response. The Barham plaintiffs have done so, see 631 Response to Objections refiled pursuant to September 8, 2010 hearing. Accordingly, the relief requested in 626 has been GRANTED. Signed by Judge Emmet G. Sullivan on September 9, 2010. (lcegs4) Modified on 9/9/2010 (clv, )."

    "summary": "<p>The initial plaintiffs in this case were a group of twenty-two individuals who were arrested in September 2002 at a mass political demonstration in Washington, D.C. On November 19, 2002, they filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia under 28 U.S.C §§ 1331 and 1343 against a number of municipal and federal defendants, including the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department (MPD), Chief of Police Charles Ramsey of the Metropolitan Police Department, the District of Columbia, the Mayor D.C. Anthony Williams, Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton, Attorney General John Ashcroft, the U.S., and other unidentified officers and law enforcement agencies.</p><p>Represented by the Partnership for Civil Justice and the National Lawyers Guild Mass Defense Committee, the plaintiffs claimed they were falsely arrested and imprisoned without probable cause, depriving them of their rights under the First and Fourth Amendments. The plaintiffs further alleged the defendants--in violation of the Equal Protection Clause--processed and treated them differently than others arrested for minor offenses. Finally, the plaintiffs accused the arresting officials of negligence, as well as negligent supervision on the part of their supervisors. This case was one of a number filed or pending around that time against the Metropolitan Police Department and relating to its handling of mass demonstrations.  </p><p>The plaintiffs amended their complaint three times to include a charge of deliberate indifference to constitutional rights against the arresting officers' supervisors and to propose a class of plaintiffs consisting of all persons--about 400 in total--who were arrested in Pershing Park September 27, 2002.  In amending their complaint, the plaintiffs also added a new municipal defendant, Peter Newsham, Assistant Chief of Police, as well as a new federal defendant, Richard Murphy, who was the acting Commander of the Special Forces Branch of the U.S. Park Police.  </p><p>The MPD, according to the complaint, had a practice of of deploying its Civil Disturbance Units for the purpose of disturbing and disrupting protests and demonstrations. And the CDU was successful doing so, though by means of allegedly unconstitutional tactics, resulting in false arrest and imprisonment. One tactic of note was the CDU's \"box-in\" technique, in which CDU officers (clad in full riot gear) trap individuals--protestors and civilians alike--by surrounding them on all sides, foreclosing any chance of escape, then arresting them. In this manner the CPD not only curtailed but also deterred the exercise of constitutionally protected rights.   </p><p>The second aspect of the MPD's allegedly unconstitutional practices ensued after the arrests. The plaintiffs claimed the MPD disparately treated individuals arrested for minor offenses in connection with mass demonstrations. Those arrested simply for minor offenses (i.e., not in connection with any demonstration) were given the \"post and trial\" option, receiving quick release from jail in exchange for offering up collateral, and for which they also received a trial date for challenging the legality of their arrest. On the other hand, those individuals arrested for minor offenses in connection with demonstrations were released instead by \"posting and forfeiting.\" In exchange for their release, they were instructed they had to forfeit their chance to challenge the legality of their arrest.  As a result, they faced a longer confinement solely because they wished to challenge the legality of their arrest.  This disparate treatment, the plaintiffs claimed, was the denial of equal protection under the law.</p><p>The plaintiffs alleged that the FBI used the mass arrests as a mass intelligence gathering operation, with the MPD soliciting--then providing the FBI--identification information from those it falsely arrested as a condition of their release. Thus the FBI compiled intelligence on political activists, their activities, and others who either associated with them or simply happened to be in their proximity.</p><p>The plaintiffs requested declaratory judgment that the MPD's practice of disrupting and preventing political protests without justification violated the plaintiffs' rights under First and Fourth Amendments and the plaintiffs sought a permanent injunction prohibiting such tactics.  Among other forms of relief--including compensatory and punitive damages--the plaintiffs requested the Court mandate the MPD treat those arrested for minor offenses in connection with mass demonstrations just as it does those arrested simply for minor offenses, by enjoining it from (1) subjecting them to a harsher period of processing and confinement, (2) threatening or instituting longer periods of confinement for those who wish to challenge the legality of their arrest, and (3) offering them the \"post and forfeit\" option instead of the customary \"post and trial\" option.  As to the federal defendants, the plaintiffs requested a permanent injunction barring the Department of Justice from accessing information relating to arrests at mass demonstrations made by local law enforcement authorities.</p><p>On September 24, 2003, the Court (Judge Emmet G. Sullivan) approved certification of the plaintiffs' proposed class, finding their circumstances of their arrest were virtually identical, all resulting from a single action in which the arrestees were treated as a single group by law enforcement.  </p><p>The individual municipal defendants moved for dismissal on the grounds of qualified immunity. The court ruled Williams was entitled to qualified immunity on the false arrest and excessive force claims, as was Ramsey with respect to the latter. 338 F. Supp. 2d 48, 52. Because there was an issue of fact regarding if Ramsey knew whether a dispersal order had been given before the plaintiffs at Pershing Park were arrested, the court determined qualified immunity for Ramsey for the false arrest claims was inappropriate.  Id. at 62.  The court also found Newsham was not entitled to qualified immunity.  Id. at 57.  Finally, the court held the MPD's failure to offer arrestees post and trial did not violate the Equal Protection Clause, explaining there was no evidence that the plaintiffs were treated differently than other groups of arrestees regarding the availability of the \"post and trial\" option.  Id. at 70.</p><p>The federal defendants also moved for dismissal on the grounds of qualified immunity, arguing in addition that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring their claims for injunctive relief. The Court denied the defendants' standing argument, finding the plaintiffs had shown injury, causation, and redressability--and explaining that the U.S. Park Police not only participated in the arrests at Pershing Park but also could have reasonably understood there was no probable cause for arresting every person in the park.  2007 WL 2007335 at * 6.  The Court next determined that defendant Murphy was not entitled to qualified immunity because his alleged conduct--participating in a mass-arrest undertaken without probable cause--violated a clearly established constitutional right.  Id. at *10.  Defendant Murphy also challenged the § 1983 claim against him, arguing there was no evidence he was acting under color of state law at the time of the mass arrest. The court rejected this argument, too, finding evidence that state and federal officials acted in concert to carry out the mass arrest and noting Murphy and the Park Police acted with the encouragement and at the request of the MPD.  Id. at *11. The Court also found the FBI's motion for summary judgment was premature because not enough discovery had been performed.  Id. at *11.  </p><p>In March 2010 the plaintiffs and municipal defendants filed a motion for preliminary approval of a class settlement. The parties observed that, as a result of this and similar contemporaneous lawsuits, the Council of the District of Columbia had enacted the \"First Amendment Rights and Police Standards Act of 2004,\" which was specifically crafted to provide the relief plaintiffs sought, thus eliminating their need for equitable relief from the Court. No recurrence of \"box in\" mass arrests of protestors had taken place since the Act took effect. In addition, there had been favorable developments for the plaintiffs as a result of settlements from similar cases targeting the MPD's practices. See, Becker v. District of Columbia, Docket No. 1:01-cv-00811 (D.D.C. Apr. 13, 2001); Int'l Action Ctr. v. United States, Docket No. 1:01-cv-00072 (D.D.C. Jan. 16, 2001). </p><p>The plaintiffs noted their satisfaction at having implicitly received declaratory judgment from Judge Sullivan's opinions. E.g., 338 F. Supp. 2d 48, 58 (identifying the \"'bright line rule' that 'where a group contains persons who have not been violent or obstructive, police may not mass arrest the demonstration as a group without fair warning or notice and the opportunity to come into compliance and disperse'\"); 434 F. 3d 565, 575 (holding, under the Fourth Amendment, only \"when compelling circumstances are present, the police may be justified in detaining an undifferentiated crowd of protestors, but only after providing a lawful order to disperse followed by a reasonable opportunity to comply with that order\").  And by a previous order of Judge Sullivan, the class had received expungement of the arrest from their records.  </p><p>The District agreed to allocate $8.25 million from its Judgment and Settlement Fund for the class settlement. Under the settlement, each enrolled member would receive $16,000, and attorneys fees and costs were also included, totaling about $2.5 million.  </p><p>The District additionally agreed to allocate funds for implementing a document management system to prevent evidence loss or destruction, which apparently had occurred during this case.  Under its new system, the agreement stipulated, the MPD would preserve and index records relating to mass demonstrations and protests, and the MPD would report to plaintiffs' representatives and the Court every six months during the three-year enforcement period of three years, during which time the Court retained jurisdiction to ensure compliance.  </p><p>The Court approved the parties' motion on September 22, 2010. Following the fairness hearing, in September 2010 the parties submitted--and the court approved--the final settlement agreement.  Over the next several year, the parties engaged in enforcement activities, provided status reports, and moved for attorneys fees. Negotiations between the plaintiffs and the federal defendants continued.</p><p>On May 10, 2015, the plaintiffs and the federal defendants jointly moved for preliminary approval of a proposed class settlement. The following day the court granted the motion. Under the terms of the agreement, the defendants were required to pay a class-wide monetary settlement totaling $2,208,000 and to changes the U.S. Park Police policies and practices regarding mass arrest. The agreement was set to expire three years after the latest occurrence of either the grant of final approval, the disposition of all appeals, or the denial or all appeals. The court retained jurisdiction to enforce the agreement.</p><p>On July 1, 2015, the parties moved for final approval of the agreement following the fairness hearing. After the court granted final approval on July 8, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a stipulation of dismissal as to the defendant FBI. The court dismissed the FBI as a defendant on July 28, 2015. As of July 10, 2018, there is no indication of non-compliance following final approval. As such the settlement terminated on July 8, 2018, three years after the grant of final approval. The case is presumably closed.</p>",

The plaintiffs were a class of individuals-numbering about 400-who were arrested in September 2002 at a mass political demonstration in Washington, D.C.; there were various federal defendants, as well. The plaintiffs claimed they were falsely arrested and imprisoned without probable cause, in deprivation of their First and Fourth Amendment rights.  While the case was pending, the Council of the District of Columbia enacted the \"First Amendment Rights and Police Standards Act of 2004,\" which was specifically crafted to provide the relief plaintiffs sought, thus eliminating their need for equitable relief from the Court.  The claims against the municipal defendants ended in settlement totaling about $8.25 million, with the District additionally agreeing to allocate funds to implement a document management system to prevent the loss or destruction of evidence relating to mass demonstrations and protests. The settlement agreement terminated in July 2018. The case is closed.",

Accordingly, as the Chang plaintiffs admitted both in their written\nobjections and during the status hearing on September 8, 2010, their objections to the\nproposed settlement are not properly before the Court. Nevertheless, in the interest of\ntransparency and of preserving a complete record in this case, the Court concluded that\nthe Chang objections should appear on the public record and directed Barham\nplaintiffs to re−file their response to the Chang plaintiffs' objections, and to include\nthose objections as an attachment to the response.

Motion for Final Approval of Class Settlement and Payment Distribution \nThe parties jointly presented the Court with the Settlement Agreement and basis \ndemonstrating that the  proposed  settlement,  relief  and  payments  therein  are  “fair,  reasonable,  and  \nadequate,”  and  which  detailed  the  substantial  equitable  relief  that  has  issued  changing  police  \npractices and policies as pertains to conduct during mass demonstration activities. See Joint \nMotion for Prel. App., Supporting Memo. at 2 – 16 (Dkt. No. 595) (also attached as Exhibit 1). \nThere are no facts or circumstances that have developed since that detailed submission \nthat would counsel otherwise. \nSince that filing, Judge Paul L. Friedman has granted final approval to the class action in \nBecker v. District of Columbia, Civil Action 01-0811, which arose from a predecessor mass \narrest in connection with the April 2000 IMF / World Bank protests and which was structured \nnearly identically to the relief proposed herein for the benefit of the Barham class, which was \nsubject to a mass arrest in connection with the September 2002 IMF / World Bank protests. The \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 629   Filed 09/07/10   Page 4 of 42\nBarham plaintiffs, in their complaint, alleged the September 2002 Barham mass arrest to be a \nperpetuation of ongoing challenged police tactics that were manifest in connection with the April \n2000 mass arrest, as well as during the January 2001 Presidential Inaugural protests, among other \ninstances. Barham First Amended Complaint (Dkt. No. 16) ¶¶ 3 – 5. \nReflecting on the historic and substantial nature of the equitable relief and reforms, \nsecured through litigation, settlement, and legislation which Judge Friedman observed to be the \n“direct  result”  of  the  protest  class  actions  and  related work, the Court at the Becker Fairness \nHearing found that \n“There  are  First  Amendment  protections  through  this  lawsuit  and  through  the  \nimpact of this and the other lawsuits have had on the legislative arm of the \nDistrict of Columbia government, the council of the District of Columbia. The \nequitable relief has effectively changed the landscape, both practically on the \nstreets and legally, in the courts of the District of Columbia and under law as \npertains  to  police  conduct  during  mass  demonstrations.” \nTranscript of June 30, 2010 Fairness Hearing Before the Honorable Paul L. Friedman at 31 \n(Exhibit 2). \nThe parties concur with this assessment, jointly reaffirm their representations in the \nBarham Joint Motion for Preliminary Approval and jointly move the Court to grant final \napproval of the Settlement and payment distribution therein. \nOn March 30, 2010, this Court granted preliminary approval of the Settlement \nAgreement. (Dkt. No. 599).  The Court approved and directed the form and manner of notice to \nthe class. Id. As detailed herein, those procedures have been implemented. \nAs referenced below, the Administrator received 321 timely claim forms and zero late-\nfiled claims. Declaration of Ryanne Cozzi, attached as Exhibit 3,  (hereinafter  “Cozzi  Decl.”)  ¶15. \nAs of September 1, 2010, the Class Administrator has resolved all but four of the claims filed \nand,  to  date,  has  “determined  that  299  are  filed  by  claimants  who  have  been  determined  to  be  \neligible  Class  Members.”  First  Supplemental  Declaration  of  Ryanne  Cozzi,  attached as Exhibit 4 \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 629   Filed 09/07/10   Page 5 of 42\n(hereinafter  “Cozzi  First  Supp.  Decl.”)  ¶2.The Class Administrator is diligently working towards \nfinal resolution of the four pending claims and will file an additional supplement to report when \nresolved. Id. ¶3. One claim was denied because the claimant had previously entered into a \nsettlement agreement with the District for the same underlying events. Cozzi Decl. ¶16 (Exhibit \n3). The remainder of the claims have been denied based on the fact that the individuals were \narrested at locations outside of Pershing Park such that they are conclusively not Class Members \nor based on the failure to evidence class membership. Id. ¶¶16-17. \nReflecting the overwhelmingly positive support by the class of the Settlement, the \nparticipation rate is an astounding 85%.  \nAside from a rambling unfocused submission from counsel in Chang v. US, Civil Action \nNo. 02-2010, there has been received only one timely letter of objection. The merits of those \nobjections have been addressed in filings by the parties at Barham Dkt. Nos.623, 624, 625. This \nvery low level of objection itself weighs in favor of approval of the settlement. See Thomas v. \nAlbright, 139 F.3d 227, 232 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (“[A]  settlement  can  be  fair  even  though  a  \nsignificant  portion  of  the  class  and  some  of  the  named  plaintiffs  object  to  it.”); Radosti v. \nEnvision, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56373, at *57 (D.D.C. June 8, 2010) (same); In re \nLorazepam & Clorazepate Antitrust Litig. (Lorazepam II), 2003 WL 22037741, at *6 (D.D.C. \nJune 16, 2003) (the  “existence  of  even  a  relatively  few  objections  certainly  counsels  in  favor  of  \napproval”). \nEach of the seventeen class representatives supports the settlement. Collectively and \nindividually the class representatives reflect a broad and diverse spectrum of persons arrested \nincluding demonstrators, media, legal observers, bystanders or interested persons who had \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 629   Filed 09/07/10   Page 6 of 42\napproached to witness and observe, or associate with, the free speech activities occurring within \nPershing Park. \nIn light of the record, the extraordinary equitable reforms and relief, the sufficiency of the \nmonetary relief, and for reasons stated herein, the Court should issue final approval of the \nproposed settlement and payment terms. As presented in the motion for preliminary approval, \n(Dkt. No. 595), and herein, the Settlement  and  payment  distribution  are  “fair,  reasonable,  and  \nadequate” and should be approved. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e). \nA.  Form and Manner of Notice to the Class \nAs approved by the Court in its March 30,  2010  Order,  Gilardi  &  Co.,  LLC  (“Gilardi”),  \nserved as Claims Administrator for the Settlement and oversaw the dissemination of Notice to \nthe identifiable Class Members. Cozzi Decl. ¶1 (Exhibit 3). \nGilardi reports receipt of 321 timely Claim Forms. Id. ¶15. Of those 321, a total of 299 \nClaims have been deemed submitted by eligible class members, and four (4) claims remain \npending as of September 1, 2010. Cozzi First Supp. Decl. ¶¶1, 2 (Exhibit 4). \nThe  Settlement  Class’  reaction  to the Settlement has been overwhelmingly positive. \nApart from the Chang plaintiffs, not a single Class Member has requested exclusion \nduring the claims period, Cozzi Decl. ¶14 (Exhibit 3). The Chang plaintiffs did send a letter to \nthe Administrator in which they advised  that  “The  Chang Plaintiffs have previously opted out of \nany participation in the Barham class  action.  .  .”  Id.   \nAs  required  by  the  Court’s  March 30, 2010 Order, the Notice distributed to the Class set \nforth the rights of Class Members under the Settlement, including their rights to (a) exclude \nthemselves from the Class and the Settlement, see Cozzi Decl., Exhibit A (Notice) at 1, 2, 4, 10, \n11 (pages each referencing exclusion, providing specific procedures on page 10); (b) object to \nthe Settlement, id. at 1, 2, 3, 9, 11 (pages each referencing right to object, providing specific \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 629   Filed 09/07/10   Page 7 of 42\nprocedures on pages 11); and (c) attend the Fairness Hearing, id. at 1, 2, 9, 10, 11, 12 (pages each \nreferencing Fairness Hearing, providing specific procedures to appear on pages 11 – 12). \nThe deadline for exclusion was specified in the Notice to be July 15, 2010. Id. at 1, 10. \nThe deadline for objections was specified in the Notice to be July 15, 2010. Id. at 1, 11. \nThe deadline for sending a  letter  stating  one’s  “Notice  of Intent to Appear at a Fairness \nHearing in Barham, et al. v. Ramsey, et al.”  was  specified  in  the  Notice  to  be  July 15, 2010. Id. at \n1, 12. \nThus, the deadlines for requesting exclusion, presenting objections or stating the intent to \nappear at the Fairness Hearing have all passed.  \nThe Chang plaintiffs sent a letter through counsel advising that they consider themselves \nto have been previously excluded. Cozzi Decl. ¶14. Even if the Chang plaintiffs are deemed to be \nmembers of the class, no other class member has asked to be excluded during the claims period. \nNo request to appear at the Fairness Hearing has been received, except for the request \nfrom Chang counsel. Declaration of Carl Messineo, attached as Exhibit 5,  (hereinafter  “Messineo  \nDecl.”)  at ¶6. \nAside from the objections from Chang counsel, one timely letter of objection has been \nreceived from a class member and one untimely letter has been received. Id. ¶5. \nOn or before, April 15, 2010, using all available arrest related records, Gilardi sent Notice \nand  Claim  Forms  (a  “Notice  Packet”)  to  the  last  known  address  of  all  identifiable  Class \nMembers. Cozzi Decl. ¶2 (Exhibit 3). In order to ascertain the last known address of all \nidentifiable Class Members, Gilardi reviewed and aggregated records from a multitude of \nsources. Id. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 629   Filed 09/07/10   Page 8 of 42\nUsing these sources, Gilardi was able to identify ostensible or last known addresses for \n362 persons. Id. ¶5. Gilardi used the U.S. Postal Service National Change Of Address (NCOA) \ndatabase to attempt to update these addresses. Id. ¶2.  \nGilardi thereafter additionally fulfilled 103 requests for notice packages from individuals \nwho learned of the settlement through other means, such as Publication Notices, e-mail \nannouncements, website or toll free telephone inquiries, or whose names had been brought to \nGilardi’s  attention  by  Class  Counsel.  Id. ¶7. \nThe address information from law enforcement records was originally assembled \ncontemporaneous with the arrest on September 27, 2002, which meant that many addresses were \nno longer current. Over the course of the notice period, Gilardi received 109 Notice Packets \nreturned by the USPS with undeliverable addresses. Id. ¶12. Five were returned by the U.S. \nPostal Service with updated addresses, to which the Notice Packet was promptly remailed. Id. ¶8. \nGilardi used a commercial third-party provider locator service, the Accurint Service, \nprovided by Lexis-Nexis, (which drew upon a broader set of information than the NCOA \ndatabase including public records searches and credit report header information) as an additional \nsource to secure updated addresses information for potential Class Members who had not filed a \nclaim in response to the initial mailing and other efforts. Id. ¶9. \nOn or before April 14, 2010 and throughought the claims period, Gilardi posted the \nNotice and Proof of Claim form on a website associated with the class settlement administration, \nwww.PershingParkSettlement.com. Id. ¶3. That website also made available the Joint Motion for \nPreliminary  Approval,  the  supporting  memorandum,  the  Court’s  preliminary  approval order and \nthe executed Settlement Agreement. See www.PershingParkSettlement.com/casedocs.html. The \nDistrict of Columbia published a link to the Notice and Proof of Claim form on the front page of \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 629   Filed 09/07/10   Page 9 of 42\nthe  MPD’s  website and that of the D.C. Office of the Attorney General, as did Class Counsel on \nthe front page of the website of the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund. Messineo Decl. ¶8 \n(Exhibit 5). \nGilardi published a shortened form of the Class Notice in the Washington Post once a \nweek for two weeks, including in one Sunday edition; in two consecutive weekly editions of the \nWashington City Paper; and in no less than three regional or national periodicals/media outlets \nselected based on the expectation that the subject matter of said periodicals was either of general \ninterest or corresponded to perceived subject matter interests of the protest groups whose \nconstituents participated in the protest underlying the mass arrest. A full page notice was run \ntwice in The Nation magazine and twice in The Progressive magazine and was posted online at \nthe website of the Huffington Post during the period of June 28, 2010 through July 12, 2010.  \nCozzi Decl. ¶6 (Exhibit 3). \nGilardi established a toll free telephone number from which Class Members could receive \nclaims information and documents. Id. ¶4.  \nRecognizing that telephone numbers might be current even if address information was \nunavailable or out of date, on June 25, 2010, at the request of Class Counsel, the Administrator \nused the third party locator service, Accurint, to try and recover phone numbers for identified \nclass members who had not yet filed a claim form. Gilardi engaged in phone banking to contact \nthese persons to advise or remind them of the Settlement and upcoming filing deadlines. Id. ¶11. \nOn April 30, 2010, Class Counsel independently sent e-mail announcements of the \nBarham settlement, with links to the proof of claim form and the Notice, by e-mail to thousands \nof persons who have signed up for updates on the Partnership  for  Civil  Justice  Fund’s  work \ngenerally or specifically regarding the Barham class action. The e-mail requested recipients \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 629   Filed 09/07/10   Page 10 of 42\nredistribute the announcement widely and post on appropriate website and social networking \nmedia.  Links  or  “widgets”  were  available to click on in the e-mail that would enable the user to \nre-transmit the e-mail on to their friends, post to Facebook pages or circulate on Twitter. \nMessineo Decl. ¶9 (Exhibit 5). \nClass Counsel observed the announcement re-posted on many additional email lists, \nwebsites, blogs or social media pages. The PCJF also communicated with groups or persons \nbelieved to have been involved with the underlying September 2002 protest and requested they \ndisseminate the announcement to their constituents and, in turn, request their constituents to re-\npost it broadly. Class Counsel understands that multiple tens of thousands of additional e-mails \nor electronic announcements were sent as a result of these requests. Id. ¶10. \nMidway through the claims period, Gilardi sent a total of 322 postcard reminder notices \nto known or potential Class Members who had not yet filed a Proof of Claim. Cozzi Decl. ¶¶10, \n13 (Exhibit 3).  \nOn June 15, 2010, with about one month left in the claims period, Class Counsel \nundertook a second e-mail based campaign of the same scope and dimension as the first. This \nannouncement was focused on the fact that time was running out to file claims and encouraging \nrecipients to file claims if they themselves were arrested, or to send the announcement on to \nthose who they believed were Class Members. Wide reposting and distribution was, again, \nrequested of recipients. Messineo Decl. ¶11 (Exhibit 5). \nClass Counsel set up an internet based  “E-Card”  facility  whereby  Class  Members or \nanyone could enter lists of e-mail addresses of persons who may have been arrested, to cause an \nelectronic mail notice and announcement of the settlement and claims process to be transmitted. \nId. ¶12. The E-Card facility was promoted by e-mail and on the PCJF web site. Id.  \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 629   Filed 09/07/10   Page 11 of 42\nClass Counsel also republicized the settlement through news interviews where the Class \nAdministrator’s  settlement  website,  phone  number,  and  other  information  was  given. Id. ¶13. \nB.  Class Administration and Determination of Eligibility \nClass Counsel has closely monitored the Class Member eligibility process. Class Counsel \nattests and affirms that, throughout this process, the representatives of Gilardi have been \nresponsive to all requests for information or action, and have diligently and with care applied the \nstandards for Class Member eligibility. Class Counsel has reviewed the basis for, and concurs \nwith, each of the eligibility determinations made to date. Id. ¶4. \nAt the onset of the administration process, Gilardi received arrest data from multiple \nsources provided by Class Counsel. Cozzi Decl. ¶2 (Exhibit 3). This was a substantial joint \nundertaking between Class Counsel and the Administrator because records were incomplete and \nfragmented. There was no single source of arrest data from which to authoritatively establish \neven the identification of all persons who were class members. Gilardi was provided files from \nmultiple sources, each of which contained partial information. The types of source files included \nhandwritten field arrest forms and computer generated field arrest forms, citations to appear, \ncitation to release determination reports, arrestee information forms, notices of infraction, \nproperty and collateral receipts, printouts from the MPD Criminal Justice Information System, \nprintouts from queries to the FBI National Crime Information Center, and speadsheets containing \nadditional data produced by law enforcement during the course of litigation, among other \nmaterials. Gilardi established a database, entering the names, addresses and arrest information \nfrom the source files, utilizing procedures to eliminate duplicate entries. Id. ¶2.  \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 629   Filed 09/07/10   Page 12 of 42\nThis database was used as the initial method for confirming class eligibility. When Proof \nof Claim forms were received, the identification information was checked against the database to \ndetermine  whether  there  was  a  “match.” \nFor each Claimant  that  Gilardi  was  unable  to  “match”  against  the  arrest  data  in  the  \nGilardi compiled database, Gilardi has sent the Proof of Claim Forms to Class Counsel for the \npurposes of conducting a broader review of litigation-related materials to determine whether \ngovernment records of the Claimant’s  arrest  can  be  located.  Id. ¶15; Messineo Decl. ¶14 (Exhibit \n5). \nClass Counsel has placed all documents and spreadsheets or printouts that were produced \nin the course of litigation into a computer-based document management system. These materials \nhave been processed through Optical Character Recognition (OCR) processing, with each word \n(including all name and address references) indexed within a searchable database. For each \nClaimant  whose  name  was  not  initially  “matched”  against  the  Gilardi-compiled database, Class \nCounsel has searched the database encompassing all materials produced in discovery using the \nfirst name and last name of the Claimant. Searches also included partial name searches, using \nwildcards and partial names, in order to determine whether records could be found evidencing \nthe arrest of the Claimant. This process has returned, for example, arrest documentation for \npersons whose names were misspelled in the formal arrest data printouts and, therefore, not \ninitially  or  exactly  “matched”  in  the  Gilardi  database.  Messineo Decl. ¶15 (Exhibit 5). \nFor those Claimants  who  are  not  initially  “matched”  against  the  Gilardi-compiled \ndatabase, Class Counsel has conducted a name and records search through records at the D.C. \nSuperior Court, Criminal Division, to ascertain if related court records exist or confirm class \nmembership. Cozzi Decl. ¶15 (Exhibit 3); Messineo Decl. ¶16 (Exhibit 5). \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 629   Filed 09/07/10   Page 13 of 42\nThese efforts of Class Counsel have resulted in the location of government or court \nrecords for a significant portion of the initially unmatched claimants that either confirmed or \nprecluded the  Claimant’s  eligibility. Cozzi Decl. ¶15 (Exhibit 3); Messineo Decl. ¶22 (Exhibit \n5). \nFor those Claimants who were unmatched, they were sent a letter requesting they provide \nany additional information or documentation of their arrest. Cozzi Decl. ¶15 (Exhibit 3). Each \n“unmatched”  Claimant  was also provided information about procedures for qualifying through \nthe submission of sworn affidavits. Id. ¶17. The Settlement Agreement, for example, provides \nthat Claimants can establish eligibility through alternate non-records based means including \nthrough submission of affidavits from two Class Members (whose eligibility was manifest in \ngovernment records) who attest that the Claimant was a Class Member.  \nHaving monitored the administration process actively and closely, Class Counsel attests \nand submits that the eligibility determination and claims process has been handled \nconscientiously and carefully by Gilardi. Messineo Decl. ¶4 (Exhibit 5). \n  C.  The Settlement Merits Final Approval of this Court \nPursuant to Rule 23(e), the Court “may  approve  [the  proposed  settlement]  only  after  a  \nhearing and on finding  that  it  is  fair,  reasonable,  and  adequate,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2), and that \nit  “is  not  the  product  of  collusion  between  the  parties.”  Thomas v. Albright, 139 F.3d 227, 231 \n(D.C. Cir. 1998).  \nApproval of a proposed class action settlement lies within the sound discretion of the \nDistrict Court. In re Vitamins Antitrust Litig., 305 F. Supp. 2d 100, 103 (D.D.C. 2004). \n“Furthermore,  there  is  a  long-standing judicial attitude favoring class action settlements, \nand  the  court’s  ‘discretion is constrained  by  the  “principle of preference” favoring and \nencouraging settlement  in  appropriate  cases.’” Radosti v. Envision, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 629   Filed 09/07/10   Page 14 of 42\n56373, at *25 (D.D.C. June 8, 2010) (citing In re Vitamins Antitrust Litig., 305 F. Supp. 2d at \n103); Pigford v. Glickman, 185 F.R.D. 82, 103 (D.D.C. 1999); Mayfield v. Barr, 985 F.2d 1090, \n1092 (D.C. Cir. 1993). \nCourts in this Circuit have considered the following factors, among others: (1) whether \nthe  settlement  is  the  result  of  arm’s-length negotiations; (2) the terms of the settlement in relation \nto  the  strength  of  plaintiffs’  case;;  (3)  the  status  of  the  litigation  at  the  time  of  the  settlement;;  (4)  \nthe reaction of the class; and (5) the opinion of experienced counsel. In re Vitamins Antitrust \nLitig., 305 F. Supp. 2d 100, 103 (D.D.C. 2004) (collecting cases). \nArm’s-Length Negotiations and the Opinion of Experienced Counsel \n“A  presumption  of  fairness,  adequacy,  and  reasonableness  may  attach  to  a  class  \nsettlement  reached  in  arm’s-length negotiations between experienced, capable counsel after \nmeaningful  discovery.”  In re Vitamins Antitrust Litig., 305 F. Supp. 2d 100, 104 (D.D.C. 2004). \nThere is ample evidence, as reflected in the record of almost eight years of litigation and \nthe 100+ page docket sheet, and the substance of the proposed settlement, that the litigation and \nnegotiated resolution  of  the  litigation  are  at  arm’s  length. \nCounsel  for  the  respective  parties  jointly  submit  that  the  litigation  including  “[d]iscovery,  \nwhich has extended over a period of years, has been voluminous, protracted, contentious and the \nsubject  of  many  contested  motions.”  See Joint Motion for Prel. App., Supporting Memo. at 27 \n(Dkt. No. 595-1) (Exhibit 1). \nMultiple attempts at settlement, including with the assistance of well experienced and \ntalented mediators, have failed. On October 5, 2006, this Court referred the case to mediation \nand stayed proceedings. (Dkt. No. 294). Two experienced mediators, George Cohen and Richard \nHotvedt, were appointed through the mediation program run by the U.S. Court of Appeals, \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 629   Filed 09/07/10   Page 15 of 42\nDistrict of Columbia Circuit. Intense efforts, involving repeated meetings and communications \nwere undertaken. The three-month mediation period, which had been extended to allow diligent \nefforts to continue and which ended on January 9, 2007, resulted in failure. In their joint status \nreport to the Court, counsel for the parties represented that they would continue in the following \nmonths (even after the 3 month stay for mediation talks had terminated) to try and reach \nagreement. (Dkt. No. 297, Post-Mediation Joint Status Report). Those efforts failed. \nIn January, 2008, the Court proposed the parties enter into mediation with a private \nmediator. On January 30, 2008, the Court ordered the new round of mediation, and stayed \nproceedings. On April  30,  2008,  the  parties’  agreed-upon mediator, the Honorable Richard A. \nLevie (Ret.) informed the Court that the process had ended unsuccessfully. The mediation itself, \nand  issues  over  who  would  be  responsible  for  the  mediator’s  fees,  became  the  subject  of \nlitigation and motions practice. (Dkt. Nos. 410, 411, 412, 413, 414, 415, 417, 418, 421, 422, 423, \n424, 425, 426). \nThroughout this process, and the litigation, the Court has repeatedly offered the parties its \nresources and all necessary periods of time or accommodations to fully explore settlement. This \nCourt did not allow the repeated failures at negotiated resolution to be an excuse for not \nexhausting all possibilities.  \nAt the July 29, 2009 motions hearing, the Court urged the District of Columbia that this \ncase should be settled and specifically urged the involvement of officials at the top level of \ngovernment. \nYou  know  what,  this  case  should  be  settled.  That’s  what  should  happen.  This  case  \nshould be settled as soon as it possibly can to spare the citizens of the District of \nColumbia additional expenses, additional embarassment and bring some finality \nto  this  case.  That’s  what  should  happen. . . . This case has been crying out for \nsettlement for a long time. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 629   Filed 09/07/10   Page 16 of 42\nTranscript of July 29, 2009 Motion Hearing before the Honorable Emmet G. Sullivan, gen’ly  at \n14:19 – 16:6; Id. at 33:19 – 23 (similar exhortation). \n \nThe  Court  directed  the  involvement  of  Attorney  General  Peter  J.  Nickles,  “the  man  at  the  \ntop,”  in  the  litigation.  Id. 28:24 – 29:4. Mr. Nickles, in filings and oral representations, \nrepresented  to  the  Court  that  his  “primary  objective  is  to  see  if  I  can  settle  these  cases.”  \nTranscript of September 29, 2009 Status Hearing Before the Honorable Emmet G. Sullivan at \n33:23 – 24. \nMr. Nickles, on behalf of the District, and Carl Messineo and Mara Verheyden-Hilliard, \non behalf of the Barham class, engaged in a series of meetings to explore settlement possibilities. \nThrough these negotiations this agreement has been forged. \nThe opinion of experienced counsel  “should be afforded substantial consideration by a \ncourt  in  evaluating  the  reasonableness  of  a  proposed  settlement.”  Cohen v. Chilcott, 522 F. Supp. \n2d 105, 121 (D.D.C. 2007).  \nCounsels  for  the  respective  parties  have  jointly  submitted  that  “The  terms  that  have been \nreached are, indeed, historic. They are substantial for plaintiffs and are a fair deal for the \nDistrict.”  See Joint Motion for Prel. App., Supporting Memo. at 34 (Dkt. No. 595-1) (Exhibit 1); \nId. (respective  counsels  jointly  submit  that  “The  Settlement Agreement is fair, reasonable and \nadequate, in the best interests of the class as a whole, and in satisfaction of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 and \ndue  process  requirements.”); Messineo Decl. ¶2 (Exhibit 5). \nThe Terms of the Settlement Are Fair, Adequate and Reasonable \nThe monetary relief in this settlement is substantial. Also, each Class Member will have \nhis or her arrest records expunged and the arrest declared null and void.  \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 629   Filed 09/07/10   Page 17 of 42\nThe most truly unique and broadly-reaching consequence of this litigation and related \nwork,  however,  is  the  change  in  the  protections  for  First  Amendment  activities  in  the  Nation’s  \nCapital.  \nMonetary Recovery \nEach participating class member will receive approximately $16,000 in compensation. \nMessineo Decl. ¶18 (Exhibit 5). This is over two-and-a-half times the per-claimant amount that \nwas recovered by absent class members in Burgin v. District of Columbia, Civil Action No. 03-\n2005 (EGS) (Burgin Dkt No. 65, final approval order).1 The Burgin arrestees were arrested on \nthe same day as the Barham arrestees and the majority merged together for the purposes of the \nconfinement. In other words, as a class, the Burgin arrestees from Vermont and K suffered \nidentical injuries and identical conditions of confinement as the Barham arrestees. The Burgin \nclass member recovery of no more than $6,000 was deemed fair, reasonable and adequate for the \nsame injuries as experienced by the Barham class members. \nThe monetary award framework in Barham is structured identically to the framework in \nthe class action of Becker v. District of Columbia, Civil Action No. 01-0811 (PLF) (JMF), which \nwas negotiated by the same attorneys in advance of the agreement that was reached in Barham. \nThe Honorable Paul L. Friedman has granted final approval of that settlement as fair, reasonable \nand adequate. (Becker Dkt. No. 362, Order Granting Joint Motion for Final Approval). The \n                                                 \n1    The settlement of claims in Burgin v. District of Columbia, Civil Action No. 03-02005 (EGS) (Burgin Dkt. \nNo. 65) (final approval order) established a fund of $720,000 to be divided on an equal basis between claimants. See \nalso Consent Motion for Preliminary Approval of Proposed Judgment and Distribution, Notice to Class, Fairness \nHearing, and Schedule, Burgin v. District of Columbia (Burgin Dkt. No. 60) at 4. The Burgin counsel estimated \nthere to be between 158 to 190 class members. At the time of the motion for preliminary approval, the Burgin \ncounsel projected the participation of 100 claimants, which would have led to a recovery of $7,200 each. Id. at 6. \nThe Court Docket reflects there to have been 120 claimant expungement orders entered under seal on August 17, \n2007, from which the undersigned infers there to have been no less than 120 claimants (it is unclear whether the 16 \nclass representatives are in addition to the figure of 120). Accordingly, in Burgin, the recovery per claimant was no \nmore than $6,000, which was deemed fair, adequate and sufficient for the identical injury as experienced by Barham \nclass members. See also Id. at 7 (Burgin counsel  preliminarily  projected  “each  Class  Member  who  timely  submits  a  \nclaim  [will  receive]  an  amount  ranging  from  about  $3,500  to  about  $7,000”). \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 629   Filed 09/07/10   Page 18 of 42\nBarham absent class members will each receive approximately $16,000 (as compared to the \n$18,000 for each Becker absent class member) due to the astoundingly high class participation \nrate of approximately 85% of the Barham class members. See, e.g., June 30, 1010 Transcript of \nFairness Hearing before the Honorable Paul L. Friedman (Exhibit 2) (observing that the 70% \nparticipation  rate  in  Becker  is  “a  huge  response  rate”). \nThe Settlement Agreement provides that the payments to class members are to be spread \nover two municipal fiscal years. Accordingly the first payment, which will be no less than sixty \npercent of that due to each class member, is to be funded by the end of September 2010. The \nremainder is to be funded by September 1, 2011.  \nClass Representatives shall share equally in a fund that will provide each $50,000 in \ncompensation for their services on behalf of the class. This has been lengthy and hard fought \nlitigation, and the class representatives have engaged in extensive and repeated discovery, \nreturned to the area for deposition, and been available and have actively participated in the \nadvance of this lengthy litigation and negotiations. The amount of $50,000 is commensurate with \nthe most recent recoveries by individuals who have actively brought and advanced claims as \nindividuals for the same injuries. Class counsel views it as imperative that Class Representatives \nreceive compensation that is at least commensurate with that which they would likely have \nrecovered if they had advanced claims actively as individual plaintiffs over these past years. In \nthe absence of such commensurate recovery, there would be a severe disincentive for persons to \nserve as class representatives, a role which entails the same or greater activity as an individual \nplaintiff along with the additional fiduciary responsibilities and obligations in service to the class \nas a whole. Class Counsel represents that the Class Representatives have each served as stalwart \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 629   Filed 09/07/10   Page 19 of 42\nadvocates on behalf of the class as a whole and have been essential to securing the exceptional \nresults for the benefit of the class overall. \nThe award of attorneys’ fees, between approximately twenty-six percent (26%) to \ntwenty-nine percent (29%) as a percentage of the total settlement resolution,2 is well within the \nrange of reasonable fees in percentage of the fund cases. See Joint Motion for Prel. App., \nSupporting Memo. at 23 – 26 (Dkt. No. 595-1) (Exhibit 1) (collecting cases). \nThe fees were negotiated and determined separately from, and after the negotiation of the \namount of monetary recovery to the Claimants. The attorneys’ fees are borne separately by the \nDistrict  and  do  not  decrease  the  amount  of  Claimants’  Funds  awarded or available. Id. at 23. It is \nundisputed, as well as manifest by the record, that this case was litigated for over seven years, \ninvolved complex and factually detailed issues, resulted in multiple dispositive motion \nbriefings,3 which led to the interlocutory appeals of the denial of qualified immunity by Peter \n                                                 \n2    The  Settlement  Agreement  provides  an  award  of  $2,462,333  to  Class  Counsel  as  attorneys’  fees  and  costs. \n  The Class Settlement Fund, i.e., the gross settlement fund inclusive of administrative costs  and  attorneys’  \nfees is $8,251,333 plus unspecified additional monies as may be paid from the D.C. Judgment and Settlement Fund \nas needed to create a new document management system and to train staff. \n  If one excludes completely consideration of the additional monies to create and implement the document \nmanagement  system,  the  attorneys’  fees  and  costs  are  29%  of  the  total  settlement  value  ($8,251,333  divided  by  \n$2,462,333). \n  If one estimates the costs for procurement, implementation, training and operation of the new document \nmanagement  system  to  be  $1  million,  the  attorneys’  fees  and  costs  are  26%  of  the  total  settlement  value  ($9,251,333  \ndivided by $2,462,333). \n3   See Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative for Summary Judgment, filed by Charles Ramsey, et al.

Ramsey, 434 F.3d \n565 (D.C. 2006). The Class Plaintiffs filed two motions for preliminary injunctions, and \neventually secured the relief sought in each.4 Discovery, which has extended over a period of \nyears, has been voluminous,5 protracted, contentious and the subject of many contested motions.6 \nUltimately, the loss and destruction of evidence itself became the subject of extensive \ninvestigation, motions to compel, briefings, and voluminous motions for sanctions.7 \n                                                 \n4   Motion for Preliminary Injunction Enjoining the District of Columbia from Arresting or Prosecuting \nPersons for Parading without a Permit (Dkt.

There have been well in excess of 100 hours of radio runs \nproduced, often multiple versions (not copies) encompassing the same periods of time. Class Counsel estimates it \nrequired an average of 5 hours to closely review one hour of recorded radio communication, due to the poor quality, \nthe fading in and out of transmissions, the fact that overlapping or sequential transmissions can be initiated by any \nsource and (unlike a deposition) not sources easily identifiable or even known in advance, etc. There is a substantial \nvolume of video, as well. The extremely close examination of the radio runs conducted by Barham plaintiffs’  \ncounsel, which resulted in the identification of critical - - but latent and non-immediately apparent - - deficiencies or \nloss of data was exceedingly time consuming. There have, to date, been over 120 depositions in this case. Counsel \nhas also reviewed the 5,000+ pages of documents released by the D.C. Council upon conclusion of its investigation, \nreviewed the additional 11 depositions taken by the Council in executive session, as well as the multiple days of \nrelated public hearings, including those occurring on October 24, 2002, October 24, 2003, December 17 - 18, 2003 \nand October 7, 2004. \n6   Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Against Peter Newsham (Dkt.

No. 608) and the report of the Honorable Judge \nStanley Sporkin (Ret.) (Dkt. No. 575). This occurred through Class  Counsel’s  thorough and \nfocused examination of the evidence, including of the many police channels of radio runs, and \nwas facilitated by Class  Counsel’s  familiarity  and expertise with the internal operations of the \nMPD during mass demonstrations and the evidence obtained in discovery in other protest cases. \nIn addition, Class Counsel has continued to perform substantial work during the claims \nprocess to ensure widespread and targeted dissemination of the Notice of Settlement as well as in \nundertaking painstaking review of a wide a variety of records, including accessing courthouse \ncriminal records, to assist in ensuring persons who are properly part of the class and entitled to \nparticipate in the settlement can be matched. As a result, the participation rate of class members, \nhas reached an extraordinary level of approximately 85%, despite the fact that arrest records are \nincomplete and outdated, and the class is geographically diverse and not a cohesive singular \ngroup. \nThe attorneys’ fees are reasonable as a percentage of the recovery, measured strictly in \nmonetary terms. The benefit to the class  of  counsels’  services  is  far  greater  than  simply  the  \nmonetary relief as is evidenced by the substantial advancement of key constitutional rights issues \nand matters of public integrity in this litigation and the securing of meaningful and important \nequitable relief. \nExpungement Relief \nClass Counsel has, throughout the litigation, sought to secure reforms and equitable \nrelief. By Order dated January 28, 2008, the Court entered an order providing the class the \nbenefit of expungement and annulment relief (Dkt. No. 405).

Each of the Barham plaintiffs and the individual \nabsent class members is authorized to deny the occurrence of his or her arrest that day without \nbeing subject to any penalty of perjury, fraud or other offense premised upon misrepresentation \nor deception in response to any inquiry, whether posed orally or in writing. These rights accrue \nto the full benefit of any absent class member regardless of whether an individualized entry of a \nnullification  order  [see  below]  is  entered.” \nWith the collection of identification information through the claims process, and in \naccordance with the proposed Barham Settlement Agreement, each class member will be issued \nan Order declaring his or her arrest to be null and void. See, Ex. 6, Settlement Agreement at 8. \nThe Resolution of Claims for Equitable Relief \nThe Barham litigation was conducted to ensure that there would not be a recurrence of \nthe trap-and-arrest tactics and other harmful police practices identified in the complaint. \nIf one  were  to  “flash  back”  to  the  mass demonstrations of 2000 through 2003 under then \nChief of Police Charles H. Ramsey, they were characterized by conditions that led to the \nrepeated allegations that the MPD was engaged in a pattern and practice of trapping and \ndetaining protest groups, including in each of the following circumstances: \n  April 15, 2000, claim of trap and detain mass arrests at protests timed to coincide with the \nSpring annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. See Becker, \net al. v. District of Columbia, et al., Civil Action 01-00811 (PLF)(JMF) (class action with \nPartnership for Civil Justice Fund (PCJF) as class counsel). \n \n  January 20, 2001, allegedly targeting protestors at the first Inauguration of George W. \nBush and engaging in trap and detention tactics. See International Action Center, et al. v. \nUnited States, et al., Civil Action No. 01-00072 (GK) (plaintiffs represented by the PCJF \nattorneys). \n \n  Saturday, September 29, 2001, in Murrow Park in front of IMF headquarters.

Barham v. Ramsey, Civil Action 02-02283 \n(EGS)(JMF) (class action with Partnership for Civil Justice Fund as class counsel). \n \n  March 22, 2003, at protests against the invasion of Iraq, marchers were allegedly trapped \nand detained by police lines suddenly deployed at the front and the rear of the march on a \ncity block in downtown D.C.  \n \nThe Partnership for Civil Justice filed the class complaint in Barham as the then most \nrecent  in  a  series  of  lawsuits  it  had  filed  to  challenge  the  “trap-and-arrest”  tactic. They had \nalready filed the Becker class action in connection with the mass arrest during the April 2000 \nIMF/World Bank protests. They had filed International Action Center, et al. v. United States, et \nal. on behalf of protest groups and individuals in connection with the use of police lines to trap \nand surround protestors and others in connection with the January 2001 Presidential \nInauguration. They had sought to raise public and media attention to the issue of police lines \nsuddenly popping up to trap and surround protests. See, e.g., Petula Dvorak, Police Pop Up to \nKeep the Peace; Controversial Tactic Angers Protesters, Wash. Post, Oct. 11, 2001, at B5.  \nAs reflected in the complaint in this class action: \nThis complaint is the most recent in a series of lawsuits with a shared factual \nallegation: That the D.C.  Metropolitan  Police  Department’s Civil Disturbance \nUnits maintain and execute unconstitutional tactics to disrupt lawful protest and \nassembly including specifically the routine use of mobile police lines to interfere \nwith freedom of association, assembly, speech and free movement; and the use of \nadministrative detention, false imprisonment and false arrest tactics in which the \nCDUs will trap protesters (and others in physical proximity) on all sides, seize, \ndetain and arrest those trapped/seized in the absence of probable cause. \nFirst Amended Complaint at 3, ¶¶4 – 5 (Dkt. No. 16). \n \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 629   Filed 09/07/10   Page 24 of 42\nThis Court recognized  and  described  that  “[t]he  heart  of  [plaintiffs’]  ‘trap  and  arrest’  \ncharge  is  that  police  cordoned  off  the  Pershing  Park  area,  essentially  ‘trapping’  the  protestors  \nwithin the park, and then initiated a mass arrest without first warning the protestors that they \nmust  disperse  to  avoid  arrest.”  Barham v. Ramsey, 338 F. Supp. 2d 48, 54 (D.D.C. 2004). \nThe D.C. Circuit described  the  mass  arrest  tactic  as  effecting  or  “making  arrests  based  on  \nthe  plaintiffs’  occupancy  of  a  randomly  selected  zone,  rather  than  participation in unlawful \nbehavior.”  Barham, 434 F.3d at 574. Where the trap-and-arrest tactic led to custodial arrests, \narrestees assert that they were held overnight in harsh conditions of confinement, bound wrist-to-\nankle in a contorting and painful position that prevented extension of one’s back, deprived access \nto food and water, and at times to bathroom facilities, and often required to sit painfully \nhandcuffed on buses for hours.  \nThe Partnership for Civil Justice Fund, whose attorneys were class counsel in both the \nBecker case and the Barham case, made a simultaneous demand for equitable relief in a \nsettlement demand letter dated June 29, 2004 and issued in both the Barham and Becker cases. \nBecause the alleged injuries and challenged tactics experienced in both cases were substantively \nsimilar  if  not  identical  in  important  respects,  each  class’  demands  for  equitable  relief  to  prevent  \nrecurrence were advanced in the same correspondence. \nPlaintiffs presented not a minimal set of demands, but a comprehensive package of \ndemands that intruded on police operations as plaintiffs deemed necessary to protect \nconstitutional rights in light of alleged police misconduct and disruption to free speech activities.  \nThe expansive set of demands sought to address the following alleged practices: the use \nof police lines to surround, trap-and-arrest  protestors  and  others;;  arrests  based  on  “demonstrating  \nwithout  a  permit”;;  use  of  ineffective  and/or  unlawful protest dispersal orders; the conditions of \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 629   Filed 09/07/10   Page 25 of 42\nconfinement and restraint imposed on persons arrested in protests; the practice of restraining \narrestees by using flexcuffs to bind wrist-to-ankle; to place objective limits on the lengthy \nduration of confinement before release, the effect of which allegedly kept protestors off of the \nstreets and unable to engage in protected activities; to prevent the delivery of misinformation \nregarding options for release, which plaintiffs assert appeared calculated to prevent protestors \nfrom challenging the legality of their arrests by telling persons  that  unless  they  chose  to  “post  \nand  forfeit”  that  they  would  be  jailed  for  days  before  a  Judge  would  see  them.  The  demands  also  \nsought to impose public record-keeping and report-issuance requirements.  \nAs a consequence of this litigation, and other litigation and factors, the Council of the \nDistrict of Columbia enacted the First Amendment Rights and Police Standards Act of 2004. \nThe legislative history of this Act reflects that one of the expressly stated legislative \npurposes was to eliminate the need for equitable relief to issue from this Court and to enact into \nstatutory law the reasonable equitable demands of plaintiffs to this litigation. \nBarham class counsel Mara Verheyden-Hilliard testified at the public hearing on the \nlegislation. Upon completion of Ms. Verheyden-Hilliard’s  testimony,  Judiciary  Committee  \nChairperson Kathy Patterson stated, and asked, as follows: \nOne of the things that we had looked at, in doing this legislation, was trying to \nbring an end to the [protest] lawsuits here, from the standpoint of taking \naway all the injunctive relief sought, or taking away the need for injunctive \nrelief. Let me just ask you . . . if this legislation as proposed today were the law of \nthe District of Columbia tomorrow, would there still be injunctive relief needed, \nthat you needed to seek, in your view? \nMedia Exhibit A, Committee Chair Kathy Patterson, Council of the District of Columbia, \nCommittee on the Judiciary, Public Hearing, Bill 15-968, \"First Amendment Rights and Police \nStandards Act of 2004,\" (October 7, 2004) (emphasis added). \n \nMs. Verheyden-Hilliard  responded  with  a  qualified  “Yes,”  acknowledging  the  breadth  of  \nthe  Council’s  proposals  as  well  as  areas  for  modification  and  improvement.    Id. \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 629   Filed 09/07/10   Page 26 of 42\nThe  “First  Amendment  Rights  and  Police  Standards  Act  of  2004”  (Exhibit 7) became \neffective law on April 13, 2005. During the period from April, 2005 through September, 2010, \nthere has been no recurrence of the use of police lines to engage in the mass trap-and-arrest of \nprotestors. \nIn granting final approval to the Becker class action, Judge Friedman acknowledged that \nthe substantial reforms of the FARPSA were the  “direct  result”  of  the  class  action  litigation.  June  \n30, 2010, Transcript of Fairness Hearing Before the Honorable Paul L.

See Ex. 7, Sec. 109, Sec. 321. \n \n  Requires specific arrest documentation to be completed at a time reasonably \ncontemporaneous with arrest. Id. Sec. 110. \n \n  Requires, in the limited circumstances where dispersal of a protest may be authorized \nunder law, that the MPD shall issue one or more audible orders to those assembled using \nan amplification system or device, and shall provide persons with an adequate time to \ndisperse and with a clear and safe route for dispersal. Id. Sec. 107. \n \n  Prohibits the deployment of officers in riot gear to First Amendment assemblies, except \nin limited circumstances where there is a danger of violence and, further, requires the \ncommander at the scene to issue a written report to the Chief which is to be made \n26 \n \n\n(cid:15) (cid:24) s(cid:27) (cid:1) (cid:5) (cid:14) (cid:4) (cid:6) (cid:2) (cid:25)1(cid:2) (cid:4) (cid:6) (cid:6) (cid:12) (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:17) (cid:19) (cid:23) (cid:2) (cid:20)(cid:21) (cid:18) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:16) a(cid:25)    (cid:27) Ce(cid:1) (cid:10) (cid:6) (cid:13) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:18) (cid:30)(cid:31)(cid:27) (cid:26) (cid:1) (cid:4) (cid:13) (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:11) (cid:3) (cid:5) (cid:4) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:22) (cid:24) (cid:29) (cid:27) (cid:1) (cid:6) (cid:13) (cid:1) a(cid:28) (cid:1) (cid:8) (cid:6)\navailable to the public following any deployment of officers in riot gear. Id. Sec. 116. \n \n  Restricts and further regulates any use of chemical irritants, and requires written report \nissuance whenever such weapons are used. Id. Sec. 116. \n \n  Removes  reference  and  use  of  the  term  “permits”  in  connection  with  protests,  \nestablishing a policy that authorizes protest without prior notice to the police. Id.

Id. \nSec. 302. \n \nThe  “First  Amendment  Rights  and  Police  Standards  Act  of  2004”  also  addresses  issues  \nraised by student and professional journalists who cover protests. See Ex. 7,  Sec.  114,  “Police-\nmedia  relations.”  The  Act  requires  the  issuance  of  new  regulations  to  grant enhanced privileges \nof access to journalists. Id. The Act mandates that media not be denied the access that is \navailable to members of the general public and be granted additional physical access to areas \nclosed to the general public in order to assist their ability to report on the event. Id.; See also 24 \nD.C.M.R. § 2104 (regulations, as promulgated, which among other things establish the policy of \nthe  MPD  is  “that  media  representatives  shall  have  maximum  access  to  First  Amendment  \nassemblies. . . consistent  with  maintaining  public  safety.  .  .  .”). \nThe  relief  in  the  “First  Amendment  Rights  and  Police  Standards  Act  of  2004”  is  not  \nsubject to police modification. It is not regulation or policy or procedure. It is statutory law. \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 629   Filed 09/07/10   Page 30 of 42\nUnlike MPD policies, which may be overridden within the authority of the Police Chief, \nstatutory law binds the Department, including the Chief. It does not expire after three years, or at \nany time. \nThe relief in the FARPSA is tactically proscriptive, restricting police conduct within \nspecific and detailed parameters in a manner the judicial branch is unlikely to itself order. It is \nwithin the authority and discretion of the D.C. Council to so proscribe. The Courts, however, \nhave been historically disinclined to exercise their authority upon police operations in the \nmanner which the statutory prohibitions and reforms do. In connection with the protest violations \nduring the Vietnam-war era, the D.C. Circuit reversed the ruling of the U.S. District Court which \nhad ordered equitable relief consisting of a directive that the MPD rewrite its policy manual to \ntake  into  account  violations  reflected  in  the  Court’s  Findings  of  Fact.  The  lower court had not \nbeen tactically proscriptive,  but  had  ordered  that  the  “MPD  will  be  required  to  formulate  a  \ncomprehensive, written plan (preferably in the form of a manual or handbook) which clearly \nstates the policies and procedures  to  be  followed  by  the  department  in  mass  demonstrations.”  \nWash. Mobilization Comm. v. Cullinane, 400 F. Supp. 186, 217 (D.D.C. 1975). The D.C. Circuit \nreversed that order, holding such equitable relief to constitute “an  unacceptable  ‘limitation  on  the  \ndepartment’s  latitude  in  the  dispatch  of  its  own  internal  affairs.’”  Wash. Mobilization Comm. v. \nCullinane, 566 F.2d 107, 123 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (quoting Rizzo v. Good, 423 U.S. 362, 379 \n(1976)). \nWith respect to enforceability, the Act itself provides that it may be used by plaintiffs in \ntheir  private  causes  of  action  in  litigation.  Section  117,  “Construction,”  provides  that  \n“[p]rovisions  of this title are intended to protect persons who are exercising First Amendment \nrights in the District of Columbia, and the standards for police conduct set forth in this title may \n28 \n \n\n(cid:15) (cid:24) s(cid:27) (cid:1) (cid:5) (cid:14) (cid:4) (cid:6) (cid:2) (cid:25)1(cid:2) (cid:4) (cid:6) (cid:6) (cid:12) (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:17) (cid:19) (cid:23) (cid:2) (cid:20)(cid:21) (cid:18) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:16) a(cid:25)    (cid:27) Ce(cid:1) (cid:10) (cid:6) (cid:13) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:18) (cid:30)(cid:31)(cid:27) (cid:26) (cid:1) (cid:4) (cid:13) (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:11) (cid:3) (cid:5) (cid:4) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:22) (cid:24) (cid:29) (cid:27) (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:5) (cid:1) a(cid:28) (cid:1) (cid:8) (cid:6)\nbe relied upon by such persons in any action alleging violations of statutory or common law \nrights.”  Ex.  7, Sec. 117. \nThe  Act  contained  a  section  that  generally  required  “all  relevant  MPD  personnel”  to  be  \nproperly  trained  in  the  “handling  of,  and  response  to,  First  Amendment  assemblies”  including  \n“instruction  on  the  provisions  of  this [Act], and the regulations  issued  hereunder.”  Ex.  7, Sec. \n115. \nHowever, class counsel had received multiple reports from persons seeking to engage in \nprotest activity about encounters with police officials who, notwithstanding this general training \nrequirement, allegedly gave them misinformation or allegedly simply did not know the \nfundamental details established by the Act. Accordingly, recognizing this as an area of \nsubstantive  deficiency,  plaintiffs’  counsel  imposed through the Becker settlement terms – which \nwere negotiated just prior to the Barham proposed settlement - a more specific regimen of \ntraining that is sufficiently specific to remedy these circumstances. See Settlement Agreement in \nBecker, attached hereto as Exhibit 8; See also, July 15, 2010 Order (Becker Docket No. 362) \n(granting final approval to Becker Settlement Agreement). \nSupplementing  and  extending  the  Act’s  training  requirements,  in  the  class  action  \nsettlement reached in Becker v. District of Columbia, the class has sought, and the District has \nagreed  to  mandate,  that  commencing  not  later  than  120  days  following  the  Court’s  final  approval  \nof settlement: \n  “[E]ach  District  of  Columbia  Metropolitan  Police  Department  (“MPD”)  officer  will  be  \nrequired to take training on the Standard Operating Procedures for Handling First \nAmendment Assemblies and Mass Demonstrations. The training records for this course \nwill  be  preserved  for  a  minimum  of  three  (3)  years.”  See Ex. 8, Becker Settlement \nAgreement, at 8. \n \n  “[T]he  MPD  shall  refer  each  police  officer currently assigned, or assigned in the future, \nto  responsibilities  encompassing  or  related  to  the  handling  of  First  Amendment  ‘mass  \n29 \n \n\n(cid:15) (cid:24) s(cid:27) (cid:1) (cid:5) (cid:14) (cid:4) (cid:6) (cid:2) (cid:25)1(cid:2) (cid:4) (cid:6) (cid:6) (cid:12) (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:17) (cid:19) (cid:23) (cid:2) (cid:20)(cid:21) (cid:18) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:16) a(cid:25)    (cid:27) Ce(cid:1) (cid:10) (cid:6) (cid:13) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:18) (cid:30)(cid:31)(cid:27) (cid:26) (cid:1) (cid:4) (cid:13) (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:11) (cid:3) (cid:5) (cid:4) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:22) (cid:24) (cid:29) (cid:27) (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:6) (cid:1) a(cid:28) (cid:1) (cid:8) (cid:6)\ndemonstration’  activities  to  the  provisions  of  the  First  Amendment  Rights  and  Police  \nStandards Act of 2004, D.C.

Accordingly, the Becker class action \nsettlement requires that \nIn all situations in which, through mutual aid agreements or otherwise, the District \nof  Columbia  obtains  the  assistance  of  outside  law  enforcement  agencies  for \ndemonstration related duties, the MPD shall brief outside agency commanders of \nthe  requirements  of  the  MPD’s  Standard Operating Procedures for Handling First \nAmendment  Assemblies  and  Mass  Demonstrations  and  shall  assign  an  MPD \nofficer to each such outside agency unit. \nEx. 8, Becker Settlement Agreement at 9. \nA number of the Barham plaintiffs, in particular those non-class plaintiffs arrested in the \nvicinity of Vermont & K on September 27, 2002, were each charged with the offense of \n“parading  without  a  permit”  and  arrested  without  prior  warning  or  notice.  It  had  been  a  priority  \nto ensure that this charge, which plaintiffs and Class Counsel have long asserted to be a non-\narrestable civil infraction, no longer be used by police to arrest and jail protestors. The issue was \nadvanced in the Barham litigation in 2004 in which plaintiffs sought a Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction to Enjoin the District of Columbia from Arresting or Prosecuting Persons for Parading \nWithout a Permit. (Dkt. No. 144). At the hearing on the motion, the District of Columbia \nannounced that as a matter of policy it would cease the practice of suddenly arresting protestors \nfor parading without a permit. See Dkt. No. 168 (denying the motion for preliminary injunction \nas  moot  in  light  of  District  counsel’s  representations  in  open  court). \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 629   Filed 09/07/10   Page 33 of 42\nTo ensure that MPD officers know that parading without a permit is a non-arrestable \noffense, in an earlier (February 2007) settlement of the non-class  Vermont  &  K  plaintiffs’  claims  \nin the Barham matter, the following equitable relief was agreed to by the District of Columbia: \nThe  Metropolitan  Police  Department’s  Mass  Demonstration Handbook and/or its \nsuccessor publication, in the event of a change of title, shall, within 120 days of \nthe entry of judgment  upon these terms  provide written notice that parading \nwithout a permit, demonstrating without a permit, and participating in a First \nAmendment assembly without a permit are not arrestable offenses. . . \nNotice of Acceptance of Offer of Judgment (Dkt. No. 302-1). \nExcessive use of force claims were not advanced by the plaintiff class in the Pershing \nPark litigation. Nevertheless,  as  affects  the  conduct  of  the  Metropolitan  Police  Department’s  \nhandling of mass demonstrations, the equitable relief that has issued since the time of the \nPershing Park incident addresses what plaintiffs in other demonstration cases have alleged to \nhave been one cause of use of excessive force by the Metropolitan Police Department during \nmass demonstrations. \nPlaintiffs alleging police use of excessive force against demonstrators in the Becker case, \nas well as in the litigation over the January 2001 Presidential Inaugural Parade, asserted that the \nsuspension by Chief Ramsey of use of force reporting requirements during mass demonstrations \nsent a message to officers that use of force need not be reported, and by logical extension, would \nnot be investigated or disciplined. The District denies such allegations. \nAccordingly, in the resolution of the 2001 Inaugural litigation, in November 2006, the \nplaintiffs represented by the Partnership for Civil Justice secured the following relief: \nThe Metropolitan Police Department’s  Mass  Demonstration  Handbook  and/or  its  \nsuccessor publication, in the event of a change of title, shall be modified within \n120 days to state, in substance, that the requirement that an officer reports use of \nforce, as established in General Order 901.7, shall fully apply in the context of \nmass demonstration activity where the officer independently – rather than at the \ndirection of a superior officer – determines to apply force and such modification \nshall be reflected in CDU refresher training as well as the 40-hour [training] \ncourse. Where officers utilize force at the direction of a superior officer the \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 629   Filed 09/07/10   Page 34 of 42\ncurrent provisions of the Mass Demonstration Handbook [regarding use of force \nreporting] shall apply. \nSee Settlement Agreement between District of Columbia Defendants and all Plaintiffs, \nCollectively at 3, International Action Center, et al. v. United States, et al., Civil Action No. 01-\n00072 (GK) (International Action Center Dkt. No. 340-1). \n \nThe alleged particular tactics that were in play and employed by the D.C. Metropolitan \nPolice Department in April 2000 and September 2002 and which were sought to be challenged \nthrough this litigation have now been addressed through settlement terms and legislative action. \n  The legislation combined with nearly a decade of hard-fought litigation and close judicial \noversight has worked successfully to protect the right to dissent and to engage in spirited and \nvigorous protest and free speech in public fora. \nClass Counsel as well as District of Columbia Counsel are in agreement that, from the \nApril 2005 effective date of the First Amendment Rights and Police Standards Act to date, there \nhas been no use of these challenged practices. \nJudicial Declaration of the Unconstitutionality of the Barham Class Arrests \nThe careful consideration and formal rulings of this Court, as affirmed by the D.C. \nCircuit, have established lasting judicial precedent that stands not only to protect the rights to \nfree speech of protestors in Washington, D.C., but across the nation. \nThese declarations of constitutional rights and standards are, in and of themselves, a \nsubstantial form of equitable and declaratory relief that accrue widespread benefit beyond the \nimmediate litigants. \nThis Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit provided a \ncritical and detailed articulation of the standards to be followed by police in the context of mass \ndemonstrations.  “[W]here  a  group  contains  persons  who  have  not  been  violent  or  obstructive,  \npolice may not mass arrest the demonstration as a group without fair warning or notice and the \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 629   Filed 09/07/10   Page 35 of 42\nopportunity  to  come  into  compliance.”  Barham v. Ramsey, 338 F. Supp.2d at 58. The D.C. \nCircuit  affirmed  and  adopted  the  standards  articulated  by  this  Court,  ruling  that  only  “when  \ncompelling circumstances are present, the police may be justified in detaining an undifferentiated \ncrowd of protestors, but only after providing a lawful order to disperse followed by a reasonable \nopportunity  to  comply  with  that  order.”  Barham v. Ramsey, 434 F.3d at 575. \nThe judicial articulations of constitutional standards have been relied upon by protestor-\nplaintiffs advancing claims of mass false arrest against police in other jurisdictions and have \nbeen cited and relied upon by courts applying these standards to protect constitutional and free \nspeech rights. See, e.g., Fogarty v. Gallegos, 523 F.3d 1147, 1158 (10th Cir. 2008) (affirming \ndenial of qualified immunity to arresting officers in connection with anti-war protest and march \nin Albuquerque, New Mexico) (citing Barham v. Ramsey, 434 F.3d at 574); Beal v. City of \nChicago, Civil Case No. 04-2039 (N.D. Ill March 30, 2007) at 10, 12 (citing Barham v. Ramsey, \n338  F.  Supp.  2d  48,  58  (D.D.C.  2004))  (denying  defendants’  motion  for  summary  judgment  on  \nfalse arrest claims in connection with anti-war march and rally at the Federal Plaza in Chicago, \nIllinois resulting in mass arrest); Hickey v. City of Seattle, Civil Action No. 00-1672, at 10 \n(W.D.  Washington,  December  13,  2006)  (“Barham v. Ramsey, 434 F.3d 565 (D.C. Cir. 2006) is \ninstructive  here”  in  the  opinion  granting  plaintiffs’  motion  for  summary  judgment  on  the  issue  of  \nprobable cause in connection with December 1, 1999 anti-World Trade Organization protests in \nSeattle, Washington). \nJudicially Enforced Document Management, Retention and Preservation Obligations; \nFull Funding to Develop and Implement Document Management System \nThe total monetary commitment the District of Columbia has made through the \nSettlement Agreement is potentially greater than just the $8,251,333 allocated for the Class \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 629   Filed 09/07/10   Page 36 of 42\nSettlement Fund and includes an additional commitment of monies to implement a document \nmanagement system to prevent recurrence of evidence loss/destruction including by creating an \naudit trail. \nThe Settlement Agreement provides for funding for the Document Management, \nRetention, and Preservation Obligations for a period of three years, which may be extended by \nthe District for an additional two one-year periods to ensure continued funding. In other words, \nfunding as needed is established for up to a five-year period to ensure time for implementation \nand institutionalization.  \nThese funds for this system are over and above the $8,251,333 allocated for the Class \nSettlement Fund and are authorized to be paid from the D.C. Judgment and Settlement Fund, \nwhich is a funding source within the District of Columbia municipal budget that provides fiscal \nresources to settle claims and lawsuits and pay judgments in most types of civil cases filed \nagainst the District of Columbia. It is an uncapped fund, and therefore this element of relief \nsatisfies two important characteristics: it provides full funding for the document management \nsystem and does not affect the availability of funds for settlements or judgments regarding other \nlawsuits against the District. \nThe District has, in the resolution of other class action lawsuits seeking systemic change, \npreviously funded systems needed to facilitate systemic equitable reforms by specifically \nproviding for such funding in the class action settlement agreement. For example, in the class \naction resolution of Bynum v. District of Columbia, the agreement provided for three million \ndollars for prison processing facilities development, the existence of which was needed to \nprevent future instances of over-detention. Bynum v. District of Columbia, 412 F. Supp. 2d 73 \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 629   Filed 09/07/10   Page 37 of 42\n(D.D.C. 2006). These commitments were properly considered in determining the total valuation \nof the settlement of claims. Id.  \nIn the Barham resolution, the distinction is that there is no particular dollar amount \nmaximum to the funding of the equitable relief, although the funding is obviously limited by the \nactual needs of the document management system and the terms of the Settlement Agreement. \nWithin those needs, the parties recognize that the largest financial and technical hurdles will \ncome in the first years of development and implementation of the document management system. \nThere will be significant one-time start-up costs. Technical start-up costs will exist for the \ndevelopment and implementation, from a systems perspective. Other costs, associated with \npersonnel training and the integration of the system into actual case operations, will be \nsignificantly greater during initial years of implementation. Once the use and benefits of the \nsystem become a part of operations, and personnel are properly trained, then of course the \nongoing per-year maintenance costs will not be encumbered by these front-end expenses. \nThe   parties’   intent   is   to   fully   fund,   through   this   agreement,   the   acquisition,  \ndevelopment and training costs for the Document Management System, which \nwould be expected to be greater in the initial years of implementation than in \nsubsequent  periods,  and  to  establish  funding  for  three  years,  or  as  may  be \nextended, a period of time believed to be amply sufficient for the use and benefits \nof the system to be well established. \nEx. 6, Settlement Agreement at 17 – 18. \nThe  parties’  intent  is  that,  when  the  Settlement  Agreement  does  eventually  expire,  the  \nstart-up costs will have all been covered within the Agreement, the operating expenses during the \ninitial three- to five-year period will all have been covered, and the expected future financial \ncosts will accordingly be limited to maintenance costs. At that time, the use of the system will be \nincorporated into certain case management procedures and the benefits will be well established. \nWhile budgeting will, of course, be needed to continue use of the system, the Agreement has \nbeen structured and funded to make the system long-standing, cost-effective and essential. \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 629   Filed 09/07/10   Page 38 of 42\nThe Settlement Agreement provides for this Court to retain jurisdiction for three years for \npurposes of enforcement of the Document Management and Retention Requirements in the \nAgreement. See Ex. 6, Settlement Agreement at 18. \nThe District has also agreed to the series of requirements set forth below relating to the \nmandatory indexing, logging and preservation of evidence. \n1.   Commitment of Funds to Implement New Document Management System \n \nThe District has agreed to fund, using additional monies from the District of Columbia \nJudgment and Settlement Fund, a document management protocol or system the function of \nwhich is to prevent the recurrence of the destruction of evidence issues that were discovered in \nthe course of litigation.  Id. at 13. \n2.   Indexing and Logging of Evidence \n \nUnder new policies mandated as terms of the Settlement Agreement, the District will now \nbe required to maintain an index, and to log, any documents, items, things, recorded or \nelectronic/computer/digitized material related to a complaint or litigation hold letter for matters \narising from mass demonstrations and protests. Id. at 9 – 10. \nThis is relief calculated to enforce indexing of evidence, to create an internal audit trail \nthat would alert the District to any missing records or evidence. Id. at 10. \n3.  Evidence Preservation For Protest Related Claims  \n \nUnder  the  Agreement,  “the  OAG  shall  issue  policy  statements  mandating  that  upon  \nwritten notice of likely litigation and/or request to preserve documents and records pertaining to \nalleged police misconduct involving or relating to mass demonstrations or protests, the OAG \nshall affirmatively direct in writing and ensure that all documents, records, items, videos or \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 629   Filed 09/07/10   Page 39 of 42\ncomputer files relating to the underlying incident be preserved and affirmatively protected from \ndestruction  for  a  period  of  no  less  than  three  (3)  years.”  Id. at 11. \n4.  Preservation and Indexing of Radio Runs, Command Center Records, and \nOther Computer Based Recordings or Data Records \n \nUnder the Agreement, upon any command or other system activation to assist in the \nmanagement  of  mass  demonstrations  and  protests,  “all  computer  files,  communications  \nrecordings / radio runs and documents reasonably related to the event shall be indexed and \npreserved for a period of no less  than  three  (3)  years.”  Id. at 11 – 12. \n5.  Preservation and Indexing of Photographic or Video Recordings \n \nUnder  the  Agreement,  “whenever  any  MPD  officer  is  assigned  to  (or  with  the  capability  \nto) engage in photographic or video recording or surveillance of mass demonstration activity or \nprotests;;  documentation  shall  be  maintained  reflecting  the  officer’s  name,  assignment,  the  \nequipment and recording media issued; and indexing and logging the return of all media. Upon \nthe return of any media, the officer shall document the dates, times, locations and events \nrecorded and affix such information to the media itself or secure to the container that contains the \nmedia.”  Id. at 12. \nThe Agreement is explicit that it does not  authorize  such  surveillance,  but  “is  intended  \nsolely to focus on indexing and record-keeping”  in  the  event  such  media  is  created.  Id. at 12. \n6.  Office of the Attorney General Required to Provide a Report to the \nPartnership for Civil Justice Fund, and to Issue Public Report to the Court, \nEvery Six Months During Enforcement Period \n \nAt six month intervals, for a period of three years, the District of Columbia is required to \nsubmit a report to class counsel at the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund regarding measures \ntaken to perform the above-referenced system development, records indexing and maintenance \nrequirements. The Partnership for Civil Justice Fund will have opportunity for review and \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 629   Filed 09/07/10   Page 40 of 42\ncomment. The District shall be afforded an opportunity to consider these comments, after which \nthe final report will be submitted to the Court and published. The comments of the PCJF are \nrequired to be published within or as an attachment to the report. See Id. at 12 – 13.  \nThis is an oversight and reporting function that is intended to assure plaintiffs, the Court, \nand the public that the Document Management, Retention and Preservation goals of the \nSettlement Agreement are, in fact, advanced and achieved. \nWith all of this in consideration, and in consideration of the specific monetary and non-\nmonetary terms and conditions of the Becker proposed settlement, the parties jointly submit that \nthe claims for equitable relief have been resolved, the terms reached in the resolution of this case \nare substantial and historic, and clearly satisfy the requirements of constituting a fair, reasonable \nand adequate settlement of claims under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. \nAppointment of Special Master To Investigate Loss or Destruction of Evidence \nThe Class and Class Counsel have steadfastly advanced issues pertaining to loss and \ndestruction of evidence throughout these proceedings, including even after a proposed settlement \nwas reached with the District defendants. It was Class Counsel which uncovered deficiencies and \nfiled motions to compel relating to the existence, loss or destruction, of the Joint Operations \nCommand Center running resume and the existence and condition of the recorded police channel \ncommunications, each of which were the focus of the investigation commissioned by Attorney \nGeneral Peter J. Nickles which resulted in the written report of the Hon. Judge Stanley Sporkin \n(Ret.) (Dkt. No. 576-1). \nThis Court has appointed Magistrate Judge John M. Facciola as Special Master to \ninvestigate the circumstances surrounding the issues of evidence loss and destruction. (Dkt. No. \n608, Special Master Appointment Order). \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 629   Filed 09/07/10   Page 41 of 42\nThe Status of the Litigation at the Time of the Settlement \nThe settlement occurred after years of thorough discovery, as well as dispositive motions.  \nThe parties were well-positioned to evaluate their claims and respective positions. See \nMeijer, Inc. v. Warner Chilcott Holdings Co. III, Ltd., 565 F. Supp. 2d 49, 57 (D.D.C. 2008) (“In  \ndetermining whether a proposed class action settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable, courts \nconsider whether counsel had sufficient information, through adequate discovery, to reasonably \nassess the risks of litigation vis-à-vis  the  probability  of  success  and  range  of  recovery.”) \nThe Reaction of the Class \nReflecting the overwhelmingly positive support by the class of the Settlement, apart from \nthe Chang plaintiffs which are addressed at Dkt. Nos. 624, 625, not a single Class Member, \namong the hundreds, has  requested  exclusion  or  to  “opt  out”  of  the  Settlement  during  this claims \nperiod.  \nThe high level of active class member participation of approximately 85% of the class as \na whole, and the near-complete absence of objection (setting aside the attorneys for the Chang \ncase) weighs in favor of approval of the settlement. See Thomas v. Albright, 139 F.3d 227, 232 \n(D.C.  Cir.  1998)  (“[A]  settlement  can  be  fair  even  though  a  significant  portion  of  the  class  and  \nsome  of  the  named  plaintiffs  object  to  it.”);;  Radosti v. Envision, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56373, \nat *57 (D.D.C. June 8, 2010) (same); In re Lorazepam & Clorazepate Antitrust Litig. \n(Lorazepam II),  2003  WL  22037741,  at  *6  (D.D.C.  June  16,  2003)  (the  “existence  of  even  a  \nrelatively  few  objections  certainly  counsels  in  favor  of  approval”). \nConclusion \nFor the reasons state herein, the settlement should be approved as a fair, adequate and \nreasonable resolution of the class claims against the District defendants in this matter. \n \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 629   Filed 09/07/10   Page 42 of 42\nRespectfully submitted, \n \nPETER J.

R. \nCiv. P. 23(e)(2).  \nIt is FURTHER ORDERED as follows: \n1.  Within 45 days of the Final District Court Approval, or by September 30, 2010, \nwhichever comes first, the District of Columbia shall deposit into an escrow \naccount to be administered by the Class Administrator the following amounts: \n \n$850,000 (constituting 100% of the Class Representatives Funds) \n$2,872,800 (constituting 60% of the maximum Claimant Funds) \n$1,477,999 (constituting 60% of the Attorneys Fees and Costs Funds) \n \n2.  By September 1, 2011, the District of Columbia shall deposit into an escrow \naccount to be administered by the Class Administrator the remainder of the \nClaimant Funds, specifically, $1,915,200. \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 629-1   Filed 09/07/10   Page 2 of 9\n3.  By September 1, 2011, the District of Columbia shall deposit into an escrow \naccount to be administered by the Class Administrator the following additional \namount: \n \n$985,334 (constituting the remaining 40% of the Attorneys Fees and Costs). \n \nIn accordance with the Settlement Agreement, Plaintiffs and the Class Administrator \nshall petition the Court for an order authorizing the actual release, or disbursement, of funds \nfrom the escrow account to recipients. \nIt is hereby FURTHER ORDERED that, should this order granting final approval of the \nsettlement be overturned, set aside or reversed on appeal or upon review, if any by the United \nStates Supreme Court, then the Administrator shall be required and ordered to return all deposits \nor payments (with any accumulated interest) less the previously-made $150,000 Notification and \nAdministration Funds payment. \nIt is further ORDERED that any residual funds remaining in Barham related escrow \naccounts after the satisfaction of all disbursements, payments and obligations pursuant to the \nSettlement Agreement, shall be returned and revert to the possession of the District of Columbia. \nIt is hereby acknowledged by the Court, as reflected in Section VII of the Settlement \nAgreement, that in entering into this settlement, there is no admission of liability by the District \nof Columbia nor do plaintiffs suggest or concede a lack of merit to their claims. \nExpungement relief has been previously ordered by Court Order dated January 28, 2008 \n(Dkt. No. 405). In  accordance  with  that  Order,  “The  District  of  Columbia  shall  provide  for  the  \nexpungement of the Barham  Plaintiffs’  arrest  records  and  for  those  of  all  absent  class  members  \n…  [and]  shall  use  its  best  efforts  to  procure  expungement  of  the  September  27,  2002  arrest  \nrecords of any Pershing Park case Plaintiff or absent class member in the possession of the \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 629-1   Filed 09/07/10   Page 3 of 9\nUnited States Government (including, but not limited to, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, \n[or] any  state  or  local  government.” \nThis Court has previously, by the January 28, 2008 Order, declared the arrests of the \nPlaintiffs  and  Class  Members  null  and  void  and  has  authorized  each  to  “deny  the  occurrence  of  \nhis or her arrest that day, without being subject to any penalty of perjury, fraud or other offense \npremised upon misrepresentation or deception in response to any inquiry, whether posed orally \nor in writing. These rights accrue to the full benefit of any absent class member regardless of \nwhether  an  individualized  entry  of  a  nullification  order  is  entered.” \nIn accordance also with the January 28, 2008 Order, for each class member, Class \nCounsel will file with the Clerk of the Court, under seal, a paper copy of a draft order of \nnullification, and the Court will issue an order that states as follows: \n          ORDER \n \nThe arrest of [insert name, date of birth, and social security \nnumber] on September 27, 2002, in the District of Columbia is \nhereby declared null and void. \n \n[Mr. or Ms. insert last name] is authorized to deny the occurrence of his or \nher arrest that day, without being subject to any penalty of perjury, fraud, \nor other offense premised upon misrepresentation or deception in response \nto any query, whether posed orally or in writing. \n \nSo Ordered on this ____ day of __________ [date to be inserted] \n \n[signed] \nEMMET G. SULLIVAN \nUnited States District Judge \n \nIt is hereby FURTHER ORDERED that the following changes to policies and practices \nbe undertaken, as specified in the Settlement Agreement Section  III(B)  (“Changes  to  Policies  and  \nPractices”): \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 629-1   Filed 09/07/10   Page 4 of 9\n1.  Document Management System and Protocol; Evidence Indexing and \nLogging Requirements.  \n \nCommencing not later than 120 days following the Court's final approval of settlement of \nthis matter upon these terms and the exhaustion of any appeals (including any petition for writ of \ncertiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court), the District of Columbia will develop, maintain and/or \nimplement a document management protocol or system to ensure the preservation of records and \ndocuments arising from mass demonstrations and protests, and to be used also in other litigation \nbrought against the District of Columbia as may be deemed appropriate by the Attorney General, \nencompassing the Office of the Attorney General and the MPD Office of General Counsel that \nprovides for the following: \ni.  Maintain an index and log of any documents, items, things, recorded or \nelectronic/computer/digitized material (hereinafter \"record(s)\") that are directly \nrelated to a complaint or litigation hold letter for matters arising from mass \ndemonstrations and protests or other cases as may be deemed appropriate by the \nAttorney General; \nii.  The index will assign a unique identifier to each record and, if possible, will be \nnumbered or identified in a continuous or contiguous manner. One of the intents \nof the parties is to provide an internal \"audit trail\" that would alert the District to \nany missing records or evidence. \niii.  The indexing for matters arising from mass demonstrations and protests (or other \ncases as may be deemed appropriate by the Attorney General) is intended as an \ninternal control over document management; use of the indexing system described \nin this section is mandatory for all records received or reviewed in connection \nwith a case for matters arising from mass demonstrations and protests (or other \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 629-1   Filed 09/07/10   Page 5 of 9\ncases as may be deemed appropriate by the Attorney General); in the event that, \ndue to the physicality or medium of an item, a copy of the item cannot be \nmaintained or stored within a computer-based document management system, the \nrequirements of above-referenced sub-paragraph (ii) still requires such items to be \nindexed and logged in an effective manner, i.e. in a central hard copy log or a \ndedicated spreadsheet; and the fact that a record is indexed is not intended to \nestablish that the record is discoverable, relevant or admissible; \niv.  Communications that are protected by attorney-client privilege or protected as \nwork product are not required or intended to be subject to this particular indexing, \nunless so desired by the District of Columbia in its own discretion; \nv.  Records shall be indexed in the indexing system described and required by this \nsection as soon as possible upon collection or review. \n2.  \"Litigation Hold\" Procedures and Practices to Prevent Loss or Destruction \nof Evidence.  \n \nCommencing not later than 120 days following the Court's final approval of Settlement of \nthis matter upon these terms, the OAG shall issue policy statements mandating that upon written \nnotice of likely litigation and/or request to preserve documents and records pertaining to alleged \npolice misconduct involving or relating to mass demonstrations or protests, the OAG shall \naffirmatively direct in writing and ensure that all documents, records, items, videos or computer \nfiles relating to the underlying incident be preserved and affirmatively protected from destruction \nfor a period of no less than three (3) years. \"Notice of likely litigation and/or request to preserve \ndocuments and records\" is any notification in writing to the Chief of Police, or the Mayor; and/or \nservice upon the Office of the Attorney General of a civil action complaint for matters alleging \npolice misconduct involving or relating to mass demonstrations or protests. The contractual \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 629-1   Filed 09/07/10   Page 6 of 9\ndefinition used herein of \"notice of likely litigation and/or request to preserve documents and \nrecords\" is not intended to alter the meaning of those terms of art as may be used by established \nreported case law precedent in the District of Columbia. \n3.  Preservation and Indexing of Command Center and Communications \nSystems Records and Data.  \n \nCommencing not later than 120 days following the Court's final approval of settlement of \nthis matter upon these terms and the exhaustion of any appeals (including any petition for writ of \ncertiorari to the United States Supreme Court), the MPD shall issue policy statements or general \norders mandating that whenever a system is activated to assist in the management of mass \ndemonstrations and protests or other cases as may be deemed appropriate by the Attorney \nGeneral, all computer files, communications recordings / radio runs and documents reasonably \nrelated to the event shall be preserved and indexed for a period of no less than three (3) years. \n4.  Procedures and Practices to Index and Log Photographic or Video or other \nRecorded Evidence.  \n \nCommencing not later than 120 days following the Court's final approval of settlement of \nthis matter upon these terms and the exhaustion of any appeals (including any petition for writ of \ncertiorari to the United States Supreme Court), whenever any MPD officer is assigned to (or with \nthe capability to) engage in photographic or video recording or surveillance of mass \ndemonstration activity or protests; documentation shall be maintained reflecting the officer's \nname, assignment, the equipment and recording media issued; and indexing and logging the \nreturn of all media. Upon the return of any media, the officer shall document the dates, times, \nlocations and events recorded and affix such information to the media itself or secure to the \ncontainer that contains the media. This provision is intended solely to focus on indexing and \nrecord-keeping; it does not authorize under what circumstances such surveillance or recordings \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 629-1   Filed 09/07/10   Page 7 of 9\nmay occur. This provision is not intended to supplant or supersede orders or rules pertaining to \nthe use of closed circuit television and cataloging requirements set forth in such applicable orders \nor rules. \n5.  Communications with Class Counsel to Ensure Compliance.  \nThe District of Columbia, through the Office of Attorney General, shall engage in \ncommunications with and respond to reasonable inquiries from class counsel, as to the status \nand/or completion of the obligations set forth in the section, \"Changes to Policies and Practices.\" \n6.  Mandatory Reporting Obligations.  \nAt six month intervals during the three year period of required implementation, the \nDistrict of Columbia shall issue a report regarding measures taken to perform the requirements of \nSettlement Agreement section (III)(B), \"Changes to Policies and Practices.\" Class Counsel shall \nbe provided an advance copy of the report and provided opportunity to comment. The District \nshall consider the comments by Class Counsel. The comments or response of Class Counsel, if \nany, shall be incorporated as an included attachment or exhibit and published in the final report. \nThe reports shall be transmitted to Judge Emmet G. Sullivan, as well as made publicly available. \nAdditionally, the District shall consult and communicate with Class Counsel during the system \nacquisition or procurement process. \n7.  Funding for Development and Operation of Document Management System. \nThe District of Columbia shall use either the class/claimant funds that revert back to the \nDistrict of Columbia under the settlement, if any, or the Settlement and Judgment Fund to pay \nthe costs of the development and operation of the document management system. \nIt is FURTHER ORDERED that the Court shall retain jurisdiction over this case as set \nforth in the following provisions: \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 629-1   Filed 09/07/10   Page 8 of 9\ni.  Enforcement of Right of Expungement and for Monetary Payments.  \nThe United States District Court retains jurisdiction to ensure compliance with the \nexpungement and monetary payment terms for a period of three years from the Court's final \napproval of settlement of this matter upon these terms and the exhaustion of any appeals \n(including any petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court). \nii.  Enforcement of Document Management and Retention Requirements. \na.  The Document Management and Retention Requirements are those provisions \nin section (III)(B) (\"Changes to Policies and Practices\") of the Settlement \nAgreement. \nb.  The District agrees to perform the requirements of the Document Management \nand Retention Requirements for a period of no less than three years from the \nCourt's final approval of settlement of this matter upon these terms and the \nexhaustion of any appeals (including any petition for writ of certiorari to the \nUnited States Supreme Court). \nc.  The Document Management and Retention Requirements may be extended \nfor no more than two one year periods upon motion by the District of \nColumbia if the District of Columbia believes that such an extension is \nrequired to bring the defendants into compliance with the requirements of the \nsettlement. The parties' intent is to fully fund, through the Settlement \nAgreement, the acquisition, development and training costs for the Document \nManagement System, which would be expected to be greater in the initial \nyears of implementation than in subsequent periods, and to establish funding \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 629-1   Filed 09/07/10   Page 9 of 9\nfor three years, or as may be extended, a period of time believed to be amply \nsufficient for the use and benefits of the system to be well established. \nd.  The United States District Court shall retain jurisdiction for the purpose of \nenforcing the requirements of the Document Management and Retention \nRequirements for three years from the Court's final approval of the settlement \nof this matter and exhaustion of any appeals (including any Petition for Writ \nof Certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court). \ne.  The Plaintiffs do not have a right of enforcement more than three years from \nthe date of Final District Court Approval and the exhaustion of any appeals \n(including any petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme \nCourt). \niii.  Except as provided above, the remedy for enforcement is by way of a breach of \ncontract claim subject to the notice and cure provision. \n \nSo ordered. \n \n____________________________________ \nEMMET G.

On September 27,2002, the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department in joint action with \nfederal law enforcement agencies (and unidentified other local or federal agencies) once \nagain deployed its Civil Disturbance Units to disrupt political protest in the Nation's \nCapital; and to pnnish with unlawful detention and false arrest those who engaged in \nlawful civil dissent on this first day of a weekend of planned demonstrations, as well as \nthose interested non-protesters or political sympathizers who approached the \ndemonstrations to hear the political message or engage in political discussion. \n4 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 1    Filed 11/19/02   Page 5 of 43\n2.  The F.B.I. used these mass arrests as a mass intelligence gathering operation. Working in \nconjunction with federal law enforcement agencies, including the F.B.I., the D.C. police \ndepartment compelled identification information from those it falsely arrested as a \ncondition of the arrest, confinement and release. The F .B.!. and other local and federal \nlaw enforcement agencies collected intelligence and identification information on lawful \npolitical activists, their activities, and others who associated with or were in -proximately \nto the demonstrations. \n3.  This lawsuit challenges what have become systematized mechanisms of government \ndisruption of free speech and assembly to criminalize dissent, and in particular the \ntactics, deployment, and use of Civil Disturbance Units by the D.C. Metropolitan Police \nDepartment acting in conjunction with federal and other law enforcement authorities, \nagainst peaceful protesters. These units, as a matter of practice and policy, employ \nunconstitutional tactics to disturb, disrupt, infringe upon and criminalize constitutionally \nprotected speech and assembly. \n4.  This complaint is the most recent in a series oflawsuits with a shared factual allegation: \nThat the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department's Civil Disturbance Units maintain and \nexecute unconstitutional tactics to disrupt lawful protest and assembly including \nspecifically the routine use of mobile police lines to interfere with freedom of \nassociation, assembly, speech and free movement; and the use of administrative \ndetention, false imprisonment and false arrest tactics in which the CDUs will trap \nprotesters (and others in physical proximity) on all sides, seize, detain and arrest those \ntrapped/seized in the absence of probable cause. These actions are accomplished through \n5 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 1    Filed 11/19/02   Page 6 of 43\n·\".\"r' \nthe use of paramilitary force and threat of force in order to deprive, interfere with, and \ndeter the exercise of constitutionally protected rights \n5.  The earliest filed now-pending case alleging the existence of these unconstitutional \ndisruption strategies and tactics is International Action Center, et al. v. USA, et aI., CA \n01-00072, which arose out of the deployment of these tactics during the Bush \nInauguration demonstrations in January, 2001. The existence ofthese tactics was also \nalleged in the subsequently filed litigation 50 Years is Enough, et al. v. District of \nColumbia, et aI., CA 01-00811, which arose out of the deployment of these tactics during \nthe April, 2000 International Monetary Fund protests. \n6.  At each of these demonstrations, the D.c' MPD actions have been coordinated and \nexecuted in conjunction with the Federal Bureau oflnvestigation, among other U.S. \nagencies. \n7.  The conduct challenged herein is neither aberrational nor the consequence of overzealous \nbut well intentioned law enforcement. It was the implementation of a pre-designed plan \nto engage in unconstitutional preemptive arrests intended to round-up political activists \nand lock them up in the absence of probable cause.  U.S. Capitol Police Chief Terrance \nGainer testified - -before the protests -- that he and D.C. police had discussed \npreemptive action against protesters. \n8.  When one plaintiff asked why she was being arrested and whether she could please go \nfree, one officer candidly explained that she was being arrested because she was \ndisplaying political \"propaganda.\" Others were let out apparently based on their \nperceived loyalty to the government. The Washington Post reported that police lines \n6 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 1    Filed 11/19/02   Page 7 of 43\n,\\   (''\"''\\, \n\\ .. \"j \nyielded for at least one detainee when he displayed a Department of Justice identification \ncard. \n9.  This complaint additionally alleges that police treat and process those (falsely) arrested in \nconnection with targeted mass political activity differently from those who are arrested \nfor other minor offenses. Plaintiffs were subjected to more harsh treatment in custody and \nwere hogtied wrist-tocanklefor hours; They were subjected to intentional sleep \ndeprivation and were not released in a matter of hours as would normally be the case, but \nwere held into the night and overnight, for up to 30 hours. The purpose of these arrests \nwas not to enforce laws, but to take protesters off of the streets on the first day of a \nweekend of planned political events. \n10.  The District of Columbia maintains a policy, practice andlor custom of denying to those \narrested in targeted mass political round-ups the option to be released and \"post and \ntrial.\" This option allows an arrestee to be quickly released from jail or custody by \nposting collateral and receiving a trial date on which to challenge the legality of the \narrest. The MPD is advising persons caught in targeted mass political sweeps that they \nmust remain in jail or police custody for an extended period of time or may secure release \nonly by \"post and forfeit,\" which means the arrestee forfeits the collateral and does not \nreceive the opportunity to challenge the legality of the arrest. This disparate treatment, \ndisallowing the post and trial option in the case of political round-ups, denies those \narrestees equal protection under the law, and also subjects those who wish to challenge \nthe legality of their arrest to greater pre-arraignment jailor police custody simply because \nthey seek to exercise their constitutional right to defend against an unlawful arrest. \n7 \n\n, \n,  Case 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 1    Filed 11/19/02   Page 8 of 43\n, \n, \n11.  Federal agencies coordinate with the MPD in connection with mass political arrests for, \namong other reasons, using the arrests to collect photographs, fingerprints and other \ninformation about political activists and their associations. The Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, among other unidentified federal agencies, collects such data and places it \nin information databases and, on information and belief, disseminates and makes such \npersonal-informationavailable to {)ther entities. \n12.  Those who are forcibly arrested and deprived of their liberty suffer great fear, harm, and \npersonal injury. The stigma of having been arrested carries on beyond the immediate \npersonal and physical consequences of the deprivation ofliberty. The collection and \ndissemination of personal information and political associations effects an invasion and \nloss of privacy, as well as a profound loss of Constitutional right to be protected when \nengaging in or associating with First Amendment protected activity. \n13.  These round-ups and mass arrests of political activists are anathema to democracy. It is \nnot merely remarkable that such ronnd-ups happen repeatedly in Washington, D.C., but \nthat policy makers emphatically ratifY such blatantly unconstitutional tactics. \n14.  \"Ain't it a thing of beauty,\" Chief Ramsey stated on September 27,2002, as he reviewed \nthe officers about to mass arrest hundreds in Pershing Park, \"to see our folks up there \nready to go.\" \n15.  These challenged police actions create a substantial chilling effect and deterrent to future \nFirst Amendment protected activity as the exercise of one's political rights in \nWashington, D.C. now carries with it the risk of arrest, of being wrongfully subject to the \ncriminal process of the state, of being threatened with physical harm by the police, being \n8 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 1    Filed 11/19/02   Page 9 of 43\n, \n, \nbound with handcuffs, having one's identification and political activities be collected and \nrecorded -- for no reason other than having political associations that have been targeted \nby the federal government or by the local chief of police or mayor. \n16.  This complaint seeks, in addition to monetary compensation, injunctive relief enjoining \ndefendants from engaging in the challenged conduct in the future. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n17.  This Court has jurisdiction to hear this complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal \nquestion), 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) and (4) (civil rights jurisdiction), and 28 U.S.c. § 1367 \n(supplemental jurisdiction). \n18.  Venue is appropriately vested in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391, as the District \nof Columbia is a judicial district in which all defendants reside, and, independently \nbecause a substantial part of the acts or omissions giving rise to the claims herein \noccurred in the District of Columbia. \nPARTIES \n19.

Defendant JOHN ASHCROFT is U.S. Attorney General and head of the Department of \nJustice, the federal agency encompassing the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation, which is \nalleged to have engaged in joint action with the other defendants in the acts challenged \nh.erein, including but not limited to, for the purpose of collecting and disseminating \nintelligence information related to the plaintiffs' and demonstrators' political actions and \n17 \n---------\n._-\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 1    Filed 11/19/02   Page 18 of 43\nassociations. \n47.  Defendant UNITED STATES OF AMERICA encompasses all federal agencies that had \nany role in the violations alleged herein. \n48.  Defendant UNIDENTIFIED OFFICERS, SUPERVISORS AND LAW \nENFORCEMENT AGENCIES are individuals who, and agencies which, engaged in \n. joint action with the named defendants to deprive plaintiffs oftheir clearly established \nconstitutional rights. The as yet unidentified defendants engaged in the mass arrests and \npolitical roundups notwithstanding the absence of probable cause or lawful justification. \nThe officers and their responsible supervisory chain of command are sued in their \nindividual and official capacities. \nSTANDARDS REFLECTED IN THE MPD MASS DEMONSTRATION HANDBOOK \n49.  As a matter of policy, practice and custom, the MPD in joint action with federal and other \nagencies, intentionally disrupts and disperses certain targeted mass political assembly and \ndemonstrations in the absence of cause or justification. \n50.  As a matter of practice, custom, and informal policy the MPD routinely violates its own \nestablished standards and engages in constitutionally impermissible mass arrests and \npolitical round-ups of targeted political demonstrators and activists engaged in mass \nassembly and political activity and others associating with them. \n51.  The MPD has issued the \"Metropolitan Police Department Handbook for the \nManagement of Mass Demonstrations\" (hereinafter the \"Mass Demonstration \nHandbook\"). According to the MPD, the Mass Demonstration Handbook is the standard \noperational guide for dealing with mass demonstrations, and the handbook establishes \nwhat the MPD claims to be proper standards, procedures and MPD obligations in that \n18 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 1    Filed 11/19/02   Page 19 of 43\ncontext. \n52.  According to the MPD Mass Demonstration Handbook, where police intend to disperse a \n> \ncrowd engaging in a political demonstration, the field commander shall instruct unit \ncommanders \"to issue warnings to the crowd to disperse.\" \n53.  The MPD Mass Demonstration Handbook requires as follows: \n[A] [1]  The issuance ofw  arnings shall be of such amplification and repetition as to be \nheard by the entire assemblage. \n[2]  Issuances shall be made by the unit commander from stationary vantage points \nwhich are observable to the crowd, or to a large number of participants. \n[3]  Additional warnings, where necessary, shall be given from police vehicles, \nequipped with public address systems, moving around the crowd. \n[4]  The warning shall consist of an announcement citing the offenses or violations \nwhich are being committed by participants and a request or order, whichever is \napplicable, that the crowd disperse. Whenever possible, this warning shall be \nwritten out prior to announcement, to ensure clarity and accuracy, and \nconsistency, if the warning is repeated. \n[5]  The entire warning process shall be documented by means of an audio-visual \nrecording, if available. \n[B)  As a frrst means of dispersing a crowd under static conditions, the unit \ncommander shall attempt to verbally persuade the crowd to disperse of its own \naccord by announced available exit routes. \n[C][l]  If, after a reasonable time following the initial warning, the crowd refuses to \ndisperse, the unit commander shall issue a fmal warning ordering the participants \nto disperse or be subj ect to arrest. \n[2]  If, after a reasonable amount of time following the final warning, the crowd \ncontinues in its refusal to disperse, the unit commander shall direct that violators \nbe arrested. \n54.  None of the plaintiffs were afforded benefit or protection of the standards described \nabove in the MPD-issued Mass Demonstration Handbook. The MPD violated these \nstandards with respect to plaintiffs and hundreds of others. \nTHE DEFENDANTS' PLAN FOR \nPOLITICAL ROUNDUPS AND \"PREEMPTIVE\" ARRESTS \n55.  The MPD and other defendants had advance knowledge that there was planned a \nweekend ofp olitical demonstration activity beginning on Friday, September 27,2002. \n19 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 1    Filed 11/19/02   Page 20 of 43\n56.  Federal and local law enforcement agencies discussed and planned in advance it strategy \nof \"preemptive\" action against protesters, as was reported in the Saturday, September 21, \n2002 Washington Post. \n57.  Capitol Police Chief Terrance W. Gainer participated in these discussions with D.C. and \nfederal law enforcement officials. Treating the protesters as presumptively criminal, and \nindicating a willingness to act absent probable cause, Gainer explained, \"I don't know \nwhy we have to wait until after they've inflicted damage.\" \n58.  The local and federal plan was, in fact, implemented on September 27,2002. As \nevidenced by its implementation, the plan consisted ofp olitical round-ups at multiple \nlocations and mass arrests of hundreds of peaceful protesters and any others in their \nvicinity with no regard as to whether such persons were, in fact, breaking any law. \n59.  On September 27,2002 District officials made it a crime to be a protester in Washington, \nD.C., and a crime for others to come near to hear the protesters' message or to join in. \nFACTS RELATED TO THE ROUND-UPS NEAR FRANKLIN SQUARE PARK \n60.  On the morning of September 27,2002 a political assembly of approximately 200 -300 \npersons gathered in the area of Franklin Square Park. \n61.  By approximately 6 - 7 a.m. there was a substantial police presence in the area because of \nthe anticipated assemblage. \n62.  Plaintiff McATEER, who was age seventeen at the time, came to the area as an \nindependent journalist. McATEER was intending to videotape the anticipated political \nevents for publication through the Independent Media Center or other press outlets. \n63.  McATEER had not even reached Franklin Park when he was detained by an MPD \nofficer, who demanded to know \"Are you going to the protest?\" The officer searched \n20 \n.~-~--~---\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 1    Filed 11/19/02   Page 21 of 43\nMcATEER's backpack before ultimately releasing him. There was no cause for searching \nMcATEER's belongings, and he expressly stated that he did not consent to the search of \nhis belongings. \n64.  Plaintiff SALIGMAN is a bicycle racer. She had been riding her bicycle as part of her \nroutine racing and fitness training. At the end of her training ride when she saw some \ndemonstrators who were peaceably walking· onto the block together, she paused her bike \nfor the purpose of observing their political activities. Without notice or warning, a police \nline popped up. Observing this line forming, Ms. SALIGMAN decided to move on so she \ncould shower and go to work. Without any warning, without even an order to \"move \nback,\" a police officer violently pushed her and knocked her off of her bicycle. The \npolice grabbed her by the scruff of her neck and said \"we're taking you in,\" and arrested \nher. \n65.  Plaintiffs BARHAM, LEHACH and SWANSON went to the Franklin Park area in their \ncapacities as National Lawyers Guild Legal Observers. Such legal observers are routinely \nat the site of political assemblages and demonstrations for the purpose of observing \nevents, including police misconduct. \n66.  Plaintiffs BARHAM, LEHACH and SWANSON were clearly identified as Legal \nObservers and each wore a high-visibility green flonrescent baseball cap and a green \nidentification tag that identified each as a Legal Observer. \n67.  On this morning, a group of protesters moved from Franklin Park along K Street and one \nblock north along Vermont Avenue. \n68.  The MPD erected a police line at the intersection of Vermont and L Streets, blocking \n21 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 1    Filed 11/19/02   Page 22 of 43\nnorthbound passage. \n69.  The MPD then erected a police line at the intersection ofVennont and K Streets, \nblocking southbound passage. \n70.  Movement eastbound and westbound was also blocked by police and/or buildings. \n71.  Police used force and/or threat of force to impede movement outside of this area. \n72.  The area within the police1ines became a detention zone, within which scores of \ndemonstrators, observers, and bystanders were thus seized and arrested within the \nmeaning of the 4th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, without probable \ncause. \n73.  Plaintiffs BARHAM, LEHACH, MCATEER and SWANSON were boxed-in by the \npolice lines and had no avenue to exit the scene. \n74.  The police issued no directives other than to \"move back\" - a directive that was often \nissued simultaneously with a blow from a baton. \n75.  Riot police used their batons offensively and aggressively, yelling at protesters to \"move \nback.\" Police crammed the detainees into a smaller and smaller area, closing their \n, \nperimeter with force and violence. This created an atmosphere of increasing fear, \nprovocation and tension. \n76.  At one point, a storefront window broke and shattered when the police, wielding their \nbatons offensively, pushed a trapped and tightly compressed group of arrestees into the \nwindow. The police had ignored the arrestees' pleas to stop the compression. \n77.  At no time did plaintiffs BARHAM, LEHACH, McATEER or SWANSON fail to obey a \npolice order. \n22 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 1    Filed 11/19/02   Page 23 of 43\n78.  After surrounding plaintiffs BARHAM, LEHACH, McATEER and SWANSON with \npolice lines, the police then without probable cause or lawful justification, arrested \nBARHAM, LEHACH, McATEER and SWANSON along with hundreds of others, \nmostly political activists and demonstrators. \n79.  An MPD officer approached Plaintiff BARHAM, who was wearing legal observer \nidentification. The officer asked if BARHAM was a law student and then threatened \nBARHAM that his arrest should prevent him from being admitted to the bar. \n.80.  At no point did any MPD officer do any ofthe following, as is required by the MPD \nMass Demonstration Handbook: \na.  issue a warning for the political demonstration or for others in proximity to the \npolitical assemblage to disperse; \nb.  issue any waruings to disperse through the use of arnplification and with such \nrepetition for the entire assemblage to hear; \nc.  issue any warning to disperse from stationary vantage points observable to the \ncrowd or to a large number of participants; \nd.  issue additional warnings given from police vehicles, equipped with public \naddress systems, moving about the crowd. \ne.  make an announcement citing the offenses or violations which were allegedly \nbeing committed and issue a request or order that individuals disperse. \n81.  The MPD prevented dispersal through the actual and threatened use of force, and through \nunyielding police lines .. \n82.  At no time was there probable cause to arrest plaintiffs BARHAM, LEHACH, \nMcATEER, SALIGMAN or SWANSON. \n83.  This unconstitutional mass arrest and round-up was directed and approved by D.C. and \nMPD policy makers. MPD policy makers and high-ranking officials present during the \n23 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 1    Filed 11/19/02   Page 24 of 43\nmass arrest included Chief of Police Charles Ramsey, Sgt. Joseph Gentile, and Lt. Jeffrey \nHerold, among others. \nFACTS RELATING TO THE ROUND-UPS OF PERSONS LAWFULLY RIDING \nBICYCLES IN SUPPORT OF ALTERNATIVES TO FOSSIL FUEL USAGE \n84.  On September 27, 2002 approximately sixty to seventy persons met at Union Station for \nthe purpose ofe ngaging in a lawful bicycle ride and to demonstrate, by way of example, \ntheir support for alternatives to oil and gasoline consumption and the pollution caused by \nsuch fuels. \n85.  By law and regulation, bicycles are allowed to traverse the roadways in the District of \nColumbia. \n86.  At approximately 8:30a.m. on September 27,2002 plaintiffs JORGE GARCIA-SPITZ, \nCASEY LEGLER, CHARLCm LEGLER and SAMANTHA YOUNG met at Union \nStation. \n87.  It was the intention of plaintiffs GARCIA-SPITZ, LEGLER, LEGLER and YOUNG to \nembark upon this lawful bicycle ride from Union Station over to the Freedom Plaza area, \nwhere they understood a political demonstration was to take place, and from there to go \ntheir separate ways, to work or school or elsewhere. \n88.  The police were aware of this well publicized bike ride, and they maintained a substantial \npresence in the vicinity of Union Station. \n89.  At approximately 8:30 a.m., the bicyclists began their ride. None of the law enforcement \nofficers directed the bike riders to not ride their bikes, and the police did not obstmct the \nstart of this lawful and political endeavor. . \n24 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 1    Filed 11/19/02   Page 25 of 43\n90.  As soon as the bike ride started, however, mobile police lines popped up - -consisting of \nofficers on bicycles and on motorcycles and in motor vehicles - - surrounding these \nplaintiffs and the bicyclists on all sides. \n91.  By virtue of their police lines, the police controlled the movement of the bicyclists. When \npolice wanted to stop the bicyclists, the front line of officers would wave and direct that \nthose following behind them should stop, Thosewho sought to leave the bike ride by \nexiting through the side mobile police lines would be prevented from doing so. In this \nregard, the bicyclists were already seized by the police as they were riding in a mobile \ndetention zone. However, the presence of the mobile police lines was interpreted by some \nas an escort and it did not interfere with plaintiffs GARCIA-SPITZ, LEGLER, LEGLER \nand YOUNG's original and lawful intention to traverse the roadways peaceably and \nlawfully upon their bikes. \n92.  The bicyclists obeyed all traffic laws· during this bike ride, including obeying all \ndirectives from the police. \n93.  There was no attempt by the police to obstruct the bike ride as it proceeded, nor did the \npolice suggest that there was even any problem. Some of the cyclists even misinterpreted \nthe police escort as a measure of support or success. \n94.  As the bike ride entered its final leg near the Freedom Plaza and Pershing Park area the \ncyclists were confronted by a stationary police line in their way. \n95.  The police forced the bicyclists into Pershing Park which is across from Freedom Plaza \nand which held about 300 demonstrators at that time. The police ordered them off of their \nbicycles. The cyclists complied, as this was about where they intended to terminate their \n25 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 1    Filed 11/19/02   Page 26 of 43\nride, and many initially thought there was nothing wrong. \n96.  However, a few minutes later when plaintiffs CASEY LEGLER and her partner \nSAMANTHA YOUNG attempted to leave Pershing Park because they had to go to work \nlater that day, they were told by the police that \"no one is allowed to' leave the park.\" \n97.  The police had surrounded these plaintiffs and the park, using police lines that had \n,popped up on all sides, and refused to let anyone leave the park. \n98.  One officer told CASEY LEGLER and YOUNG that they were not allowed to leave \nbecaus,e their bikes were displaying \"propaganda.\" The officer told them that they could \nleave if they removed the propaganda, which consisted in part of a sign displaying a \nwomen's symbol. They complied with the officer's request removing their First \nAmendment protected materials. The officer took their signs and destroyed them, and \nthen continued to refuse to let them leave. \n99.  CASEY LEGLER and YOUNG approached an MPD Lieutenant and asked why they \nwere not being allowed to leave and if they were being arrested. \n100.  The Lieutenant advised that \"At this point in time Ma'am, we are just following orders.\" \n101.  The defendants refused to allow plaintiffs GARCIA-SPITZ, LEGLER, LEGLER and \nYOUNG to disperse or leave the park and subsequently falsely arrested each in the , \nmanner described below. \nFACTS RELATING TO THE ROUND-UPS OF PERSONS IN PERSHING PARK \n102.  Demonstrators began gathering in parkland near the intersection of 14th Street and \nPennsylvania Avenue, NW, between approximately 8:00 - 9:00 a.m. on September 27, \n2002. \n103.  Demonstrators had planned to engage to protest in Freedom Plaza, which is adjacent to \n26 \n-\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 1    Filed 11/19/02   Page 27 of 43\nPershing Park. However, police officers directed demonstrators into Pershing Park and \nthe political assemblage gathered there. \n104.  Pershing Park is a public forum under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of \nthe Interior, National Park Service. \n105.  Plaintiffs MARY CANALES and SALLY NORTON are each registered nurses who \nwere in Washington, D.C. for the purpose of attending a nursing conference, \"Advancing \nNursing Practice Excellence: State of the Science,\" which was being held at the Marriott \nHotel that is near Pershing Park. \n106.  Drs. CANALES and NORTON decided to leave the Marriott Hotel to get breakfast, \nwhich they did at approximately 8:30 a.m. They were aware, from news reports, that \nthere were demonstrations anticipated in Washington, D.C. that day, and they saw that \ndemonstrators were gathered at Pershing Park. After picking up coffee, they entered the \npark in order to listen to any political speakers that might be giving a speech there. \n107.  There was an evident police presence, but no indication to' Doctors CANALES or \nNORTON that there was a problem. They passed by the police and entered without. \nevent. \n108.  At about the same time, plaintiff JERI WaHLBERG, a graduate student in nursing who \nwas presenting research at the conference at the Marriott, decided that she wanted to \nparticipate in the demonstration in Pershing Park. She knew of the demonstration from \nthe media coverage and wished to support its political message. She could hear and see \nthe demonstration from the Marriott. She, too, entered the park passing by the police who \nwere not indicating any inuninent police round-up or similar problem. Ms. WaHLBERG \n27 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 1    Filed 11/19/02   Page 28 of 43\nmet up with plaintiffs CANALES and NORTON in the park. \n109.  Plaintiffs WaHLBERG, CANALES and NORTON all observed what was occurring in \nPershing park at that time, just before the mass arrest and political round-up: dancing, \nsinging and assembly. Some people were rhythmically beating drums. Many protesters \nheld signs protesting corporate globalization and greed. Other signs advocated for peace, \nagainst war in Iraq,-and bore messages such as \"bread not bombs.\" Clearly it was a \ngathering of individuals engaging in political speech, assembly and camaraderie. \n110.  At a time between 9:00 a.m. and 9:30 a.m., the bicyclists were forced into the Park, and \nshortly thereafter police lines were erected without any notice or warning. Many of those \nsurrounded had no immediate awareness that they bad been trapped and seized. \n111.  A session of the nursing conference was set to begin at 9:45 a.m. CANALES, NORTON \nand WaHLBERG found, however, that they had been surrounded by these police lines \nthat had silently popped up on all sides. They found unyielding police lines in every \ndirection, with many officers in intimidating, black, full riot gear. They attempted to \nleave and asked permission to leave of no less than five separate officers. They explained \nthey had to attend the conference, and displayed their conference tote bags. \n112.  This was similar to the experiences that other plaintiffs who happened also to be in the \npark were having. \n113.  Plaintiff WlLLIAM DURHAM went to Pershing Park as a protester. He arrived at the \npark, and observed a drum circle there with people cheering and chanting. Soon \nthereafter, he and others realized that police lines had popped up on all sides. The police \nrefused to allow DURHAM to leave. \n28 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 1    Filed 11/19/02   Page 29 of 43\n114.  Plaintiff NOAH F ALK is a law stndent at the George Washington University School of \nLaw. He was in Pershing Park in his capacity as a National Lawyers Guild Legal \nObserver, and was clearly identifiable as such based on the flourescent green Legal \n. Observer cap and green badge he was displaying. F ALK was lawfully standing in the \npark when he found himself surrounded by police lines. \n115,  Plaintiff MARK JACKSON is an independent contractor with the Underground Railroad \nand Freedom Center, and works with a curator at the American History Museum. He was \nnot protesting, but had walked over to the park and planned to head to work when he \nfound himself surrounded by police lines that had quietly popped up. He asked to be \nallowed past the police line, but the police refused him passage, explaining \"we can't let \nyou out.\" \n(  116.  Plaintiff JOHN PASSACANTANDO had been riding his bicycle to work that morning to \navoid what had been predicted to be difficult traffic. He stopped near Pershing Park to \nobserve the protest. Thereafter he, too, found himself surrounded by police lines on all \nsides with police refusing to let him leave\" PASSACANTA  NDO asked no less than a \ndozen officers at different locations to be allowed to leave and go on his way, but he was \ntold repeatedly that he was not allowed to leave. A number of the officers advised that \nthey were acting under \"orders.\" \n) \n117.  Plaintiff JOSEPH PHELAN is a stndent at Hunter College in New York, and was present \nin Pershing Park to participate in the protests.  When he sought to leave the park, MPD \nofficers told him he could not leave.  He asked one officer \"Am I being detained\" and \nwas told \"no.\" When he then said, \"So we can leave,\" the officer stated \"If you try to \n29 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 1    Filed 11/19/02   Page 30 of 43\n(~>-\\ \n'..,--~,~ \nleave, you'll be arrested.\" \n118.  Plaintiff NICOLE PRICHARD was riding her bicycle around the City when she found \nherself amidst the group of protesters on bicycles.  She was almost immediately \nthereafter forced into Pershing Park, where she found herself surrounded by police lines \non all sides and, when she sought to leave, was told by an MPD officer \"no one goes in \nand no one goes out unless on that [mass arrest] bus.\" \n119.  Plaintiff MORGAN RESS is an artist who works with ABC No Rio, an artist space on \nthe lower east side of Manbattan, NY. RESS was in Pershing Park as a demonstrator and \nas a photographer and artist. He heard the sound of protest drums in the park, entered the \npark, and soon found that the police had formed lines around the park He asked multiple \nofficers if he could please leave, and each refused to let him go. Some officers were \nsilent, others told him to go to another police line. when he did so he would either be \ndirected to go to yet another police line or would be met with silence. One officer \nexplained, \"Our orders are no one leaves the park\" \n120.  Plaintiff MACDONALD SCOTT is employed as the Membership Coordinator for the \nNational Lawyers Guild in New York City. He was peacefully protesting in the park \nwhen he found himself surrounded on all sides by police lines.  He requested of at least \nfive police officers that they allow him to leave the park, and each time was refused. \n121.  Plaintiff LESLEY WOOD is a doctoral candidate at Columbia University. She was \npeacefully protesting in Pershing Park when without notice or warning the police formed \nlines around the park  She requested of at least five police officers that they allow her to \nleave the park, and each time was refused. \n30 \n----------.---~----\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 1    Filed 11/19/02   Page 31 of 43\n122.  Plaintiff STEPHEN ZIMMERMAN is a law student at George Washington University \nLaw School and was a National Lawyers Guild Legal Observer present in Pershing Park \nwhen police surrounded the park. He tried to leave, but was not allowed. \n123.  At no time did any of plaintiffs CANALES, DURHAM, FALK., GARCIA-SPITZ, \nJACKSON, LEGLER, LEGLER, NORTON, PASSACANTANDO, PHELAN, \nPRICHARD, RESS,SCOTT, WaHLBERG, WOOD, YOUNG, or ZIMMERMANfailto \nobey a police order. \n124.  The police actions in the vicinity of Pershing Park were executed by MPD police, U.S. \nPark Police under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior, and other as-yet-\nunidentified law enforcement agencies and officers. \n125.  After surrounding plaintiffs CANALES, DURHAM, FALK, GARCIA-SPITZ, \nJACKSON, LEGLER, LEGLER, NORTON,PASSACANTANDO, PHELAN, \nPRICHARD,RESS, SCOTT, WaHLBERG, WOOD, YOUNG and ZIMMERMAN with \npolice lines, the police then without probable cause or lawful justification, arrested each \nof them along with hundreds of others, mostly political activists and demonstrators. \n126.  At no point did any MPD officer do any of the following, as is required by the MPD \nMass Demonstration Handbook: \na.  issue a warning for the political demonstration or for others in proximity to the \npolitical assemblage to disperse; \nb.  issue any warnings to disperse through the use of amplification and with such \nrepetition for the entire assemblage to hear; . \nc.  issue any warning to disperse from stationary vantage points observable to the \ncrowd or to a large number of participants; \n. d.  issue additional warnings given from police vehicles, equipped with public \n31 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 1    Filed 11/19/02   Page 32 of 43\naddress systems, moving about the crowd. \ne.  make an announcement citing the offenses or violations which were allegedly \nbeing committed and issue a request or order that individuals disperse. \n127.  The MPD and other police prevented dispersal through the actual and threatened use of \nforce, and through unyielding police lines. \n128..  At no time was there probable cause to arrest any of plaintiffs CANALES, DURHAM, \nFALK, GARCIA-SPITZ, JACKSON, LEGLER, LEGLER, NORTON, \nPASSACANTANDO, PHELAN, PRICHARD, RESS, SCOTT, WOHLBERG, WOOD, \nYOUNG or ZIMMERMAN. \n129.  The police used pop up police lines to unlawfully seize and detain hundreds of political \nactivists and those who associated with them or were within physical proximity of their \n, \npolitical assemblage. The police then executed a new phase of the police plan. \n130.  Riot police used their batons offensively and aggressively, yelling at protesters to \"move \nin, move in!\" and telling them \"You cannot leave, move, move!\" Police crannned the \ndetainees into a smaller and smaller area, closing their perimeter with force and violence. \nThis created an atmosphere of increasing fear, provocation and tension. \n131.  It appeared to some that the police were trying to provoke a violent reaction from those \nthey were abusing. \n132.  Protesters responded by yelling at each other \"Do what they say!\" and \"Cover your \nhead!\" \n133.  Police continued pushing protesters with violence and force. At points the perimeter was \ncollapsing inward with such a fierce pace that different officers were ordering people to \nmove in different directions. \n32 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 1    Filed 11/19/02   Page 33 of 43\n/,_0,,,,\\ \n\"',~,,) \n134.  All of the plaintiffs obeyed the police's unlawful orders. \n135.  The arrestees were tightly compacted in the Southwest comer ofthe Park. \n136.  Small groups ofMPD officers began a process of crossing the police line, grabbing an \nindividual, dragging that individual to the outside of the police line, violently throwing \nhim or her face down to the ground, using three of four officers to exert force upon the \nnon-resisting arrestee, handcuffing him or her, and placing him or her on a bus. \n137.  This happened to the first four or five people in a row, until the most violent officers \nwere restrained by other officers and told to calm down. \nFACTS COMMON TO THE PROCESSING OF PLAINTIFFS \n138.  The plastic handcuffs placed on many individuals were excessively tight.  All plaintiffs \nexperienced pain, and many experienced swelling and numbness from the handcuffs. \n139.  Arrested individuals were held on busses for many hours, with their hands handcuffed \nbehind their backs . \n. 140.  Sequential busloads of arrested individuals were eventually taken off the bus and brought \ninto the gymnasium of the Institute for Police Science at Blue Plains.  They were then \nshackled and hog-tied with their right wrists handcuffed to their left ankles.  Some were \nleft in this position for many hours. \n141.  Inside the gyunmsium, law enforcement officials photographed the individuals arrested. \nPhotographs were taken of some arrestees that were in addition to their \"mug shots.\" \nSome demonstrators with political statements on their clothing were singled out and \nphotographed with greater scrutiny. \n142.  The Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation, whose agents \n33 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 1    Filed 11/19/02   Page 34 of 43\nsometimes displayed FBI identification, participated in this mass collection of data. This \ndata has been recorded and collected in databases, record-keeping or other information \nsystems and, on information and belief, has also been disseminated or made available to \nunknown agencies and entities. \n143.  The MPD maintains a policy, practice or custom of treating persons arrested in \nconnection with mass politicalalTests differently than others who have been arrested for \nsimilar minor offenses. \n144.  The MPD maintains a policy, practice and custom of preventive detention for targeted \npersons or groups engaged in political activity. By way of example, documents secured \nthrough subpoena in International Action Center, et al. v. U.S.A .. et al. include \nproduction notes for an MPD training video related to mass demonstrations, in which the \nsection on \"Police Tactics and Issues\" includes \"Tactics - Locking up the troublemakers \non the first night.\" \n145.  The MPD maintains a policy, practice and custom of holding targeted political arrestees \nwho have been (falsely) charged only with minor offenses for extended periods of time, \nin order to take them off of the streets and prevent them from engaging in further political \ndissent on subsequent days of demonstration, and to induce fatigue through sleep \ndeprivation. By way of example, documents secured through subpoena in International \nAction Center, et al. v. United States of America, et al. include production notes for an \nMPD training video related to mass demonstrations, in which the section on \"Police \nTactic,S and Issues\" includes \"Tactics - Sleep deprivation tactics.\" \n146.  The MPD ordinarily allows qualified persons to \"post and trial\" - - which means that the \n34 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 1    Filed 11/19/02   Page 35 of 43\narrestee can post collateral in order to secnre prompt release and can return for a futnre \ntrial date on which the arrestee may challenge the legality of her arrest. \n147.  However, similarly situated persons as part of a mass political arrests or roundups are \nrefused this option, to \"post and trial.\" Instead, it is the policy, practice and/or custom of \nthe MPD that targeted political arrestees are offered only the option to \"post and forfeit\" \ncollateraL Police advise targeted political arrestees that, should they opt to challenge the \nlegality of their arrest, they will not be released for an extended period of days. The \nperiod of threatened additional confinement and jail ranges arbitrarily from between two \ndays to a week or more. \n148.  Plaintiffs were confined by defendants into the middle of the night or until the following \nday, for approximate periods oftime ranging from no less than 14 honrs to over 30 honrs. \nUnconstitutional Policies ofthe MPD \n149.  The MPD, and those federal agencies which act jointly with the MPD and its \"Civil \nDistnrbance Units,\" maintain the policy, practice and/or custom of abusing their state \nauthority to distnrb and disrupt targeted civil political assembly and mass demonstrations. \n150.  The CDUs also accomplish their disruption strategy through their established practice \nand policy of preventive .detention of political activists, in which the CDUs will trap, \nseize and arrest groups of protesters by closing off all avenues of exit with riot gear clad \npolice. \n151.  The MPD and its CDUs maintain the policy, practice and/or custom of deploying police \nlines where circumstances do not justify such deployment and for the purpose of \ndisrupting First Amendment protected assembly, speech and petition activities. \n35 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 1    Filed 11/19/02   Page 36 of 43\n152.  These riot squads use force and the threat of force to enforce this preventive detention, in \nwhich they arrest and hold detainees for a significant period of time. Absent intervening \ncircumstances, the detainees will be placed on mass arrest busses and held for significant \nperiods of time, typically overnight. \n153.  Preventive detention signifies that individuals are being arrested not for engaging in \nillegal activity but for engaging in political activity, and constitutes a severe violation of \nFirst andF ourth Amendment rights when applied against political demonstrators. \n154.  The use of disruption and disturbance tactics by the MPD is an established custom, \npolicy and practice of the MPD, as evidenced by the repeated use, the approval of, and \nthe acquiescence in the use of such tactics by policy making officials of the District of \nColumbia. \n155.  DC policy maker Mayor Anthony Williams has stated his approval of the MPD's tactics, \nreferring to arrest tactics of the MPD, as executed on April 15, 2000 (and repeated on \nInauguration Day) as \"preventative\" and \"proactive.\" Preventive detention and false \narrest, whether referred to as \"preventative arrest\" or \"proactive arrest,\" when applied to a \ntargeted group of persons seeking to exercise constitutionally protected rights, in the \nabsence of probable cause, is unconstitutional. \n156.  MPD policy makers approve of these tactics, which they have used repeatedly, and which \nare the subject of pending litigation related to their use on Inaugurntion Day \n(International Action Center et al. v. United States et al., 01-CV-72) and on Apri115, \n2000 (Fifty Years Is Enough et al. v. District ofColumbiaet al., 01-CV-811). \n157.  On September 27,2002, the CDUs and other MPD officers were deployed for these \n36 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 1    Filed 11/19/02   Page 37 of 43\nunconstitutional purposes. \n158.  On September 27,2002, the Department of the Interior deployed U.S. Park Police to act \njointly with the MPD in carrying out this unconstitutional disruption strategy. Additional \nother individual officers and outside agencies which have yet to be identified also \nengaged in the same joint action. \n159.  The MPD maintains the policy, practice and/or custom of processing and treating \ndisparately those persons arrested for minor offenses in connection with political mass \narrests or round-ups. The disparate processing and treatment includes confinement for \nextended period of time including often overnight for alleged minor offenses, and the \nfailure to offer political mass arrestees the post and trial option. \n< \n160.  The above-referenced policies and customs demonstrated a deliberate indifference on the \npart of policymakers of the District of Columbia to the constitutional rights of protesters \nin the Nation's Capital, as well as all those who would associate with such protesters or \nreport on them as media. \n161.  The actions of the above-referenced defendants violated the following clearly established \nand well settled federal constitutional rights: \na.  Freedom from the unreasonable seizure of one's person; \nb.  Freedom from government disruption of, interference with, or retaliation for, \nengagement in free speech, assembly, association, petition and free press \nactivities. \n162.  The challenged actions and omissions constitute deliberate indifference on the part of the \nDistrict of Columbia, the federal defendants and other defendants to the constitutional \nrights of protesters in the Nation's Capital. \n37 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 1    Filed 11/19/02   Page 38 of 43\n163.  As a direct and proximate result of the acts or omissions of the defendants identified in \nthis complaint and the other unidentified agents and agencies acting jointly, each of the \nplaintiffs has snffered monetary and non-monetary harm including deprivation of \nconstitutional rights under the First, Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. \nConstitution, loss ofliberty, as well as physical harm, emotional pain and suffering. \nOngoing Injury to Plaintiffs \n164.  Plaintiffs all suffer continued adverse and deterrent effects from the above-referenced \nconduct. \n165.  Defendants' illegal conduct subjects protesters and observers and all those who associate \n. with protesters to unconstitutional obstacles to the exercise of their rights. There is an \nintended, ongoing and continued deterrent effect caused by defendant's conduct, in that \nprotesters and others must face the reasonable fear that merely by assembling and \nexercising their right to free speech (or to listen to speech), they will risk being subject to \nthe unlawful tactics of the MPD and federal law enforcement, the risk offalse \nimprisonment and false arrest and preventive detention, as well as the exposure to force \nand the threatened use of force by officers working with the mobile police lines. \n166.  Plaintiffs intend to, in the future, engage in or associate with First Amendment protected \nactivities in Washington, D.C. and seek injunctive reliefto prevent future \n. unconstitutional disruption. \nCLAIMS \nCOUNT I \nFalse Arrests at Vermont Avenue \n(First Amendment; Fourth Amendment; False Imprisonment; Fourteenth Amendment) \n38 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 1    Filed 11/19/02   Page 39 of 43\n\\,-\"=-,/ \n167.

Plaintiffs CHARLCIE LEGLER and GARCIA-SPITZ had lawfully locked their bicycles \noutside of Pershing Park prior to entering and their subsequent arrest.  Defendant District \nof Columbia destroyed their bicycle locks and damaged their bicycles in the subsequent \nseizure of their bicycles, converting the bicycle locks to its own use and committing a \ntrespass to the bicycles. \nCount V \n(negligence and negligent supervision) \n177.  Paragraphs 1 - 166 are incorporated by reference as if set forth herein. \n178.

Civil Action No. 02-CV- 2283 (RMU) \nCHIEF CHARLES H. RAMSEY, ET AL. \nDefendants \nMEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION \nFOR CLASS CERTIFICATION AND NOTICE \nThe proposed class, and their claims, satisfy the requirements of Rules 23(a) and (b)(3). \nClass Allegations \nThe Class Allegations regarding the mass false arrests in Pershing Park on September 27, \n2002 are set forth in the First Amended Complaint at ,,138-145. \nClass Members So Numerous that Joinder is Impractical \nThe class of persons subjected to the mass arrest on September 27,2002 is composed of \napproximately 400+ persons. The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpraticable. Eisenberg v. Gagnon, 766 F.2d 770 (3rd Cir. 1985) (ninety); Brady v. Thurston \nMotor Lines, 726 F.2d 136 (4th Cir. 1984) (seventy-four); Carlisle v. LTV Electrosystems. Inc., \n54 F.R.D. 237 (N.D. Tex. 1972) (forty-eight). \nCommon Questions of Law and Fact \nThere are questions of law and fact common to the class. These questions include \nwhether defendants (1) violated the class members' First, Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment \nrights and their common law rights against false arrest and false imprisonment by detaining and \narresting virtually all participants and observers of a peaceful political assembly and \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 3    Filed 02/07/03   Page 4 of 10\ndemonstration without lawful justification; (2) subjected the arrestees to extended harsh \nconditions of confmement including, but not limited to, being hogtied wrist-to-ankle for hours; \nand (3) deliberately misinformed arrestees of their rights to post collateral and appear at a hearing \nto contest the arrest. All arrestees were detained in the park at the same location as a group in one \nsingular police action against the class members collectively, were arrested and taken into \ncustody in the same singular police action at the same time and as a group, and were confmed in \ncommon or similar harsh conditions. Defendants violated plaintiffs' rights by common or similar \nconduct against each class member. \nTypicalities of Representatives' Claims \nWith respect to defendants' liability, the claims of the class representatives are typical of \nthe class. No fact material to defendants' liability to the representatives is atypical or peculiar to \nthe representatives generally. \nAdequacy of the Class Representatives \nThe class representatives and their legal counsel will fairly and adequately protect the \ninterest of the class. There is no evidence of any material conflicts of interests between the \nrepresentatives and any member of the class. Counsel for the plaintiffs are able and experienced \nfederallitigators and are fully qualified to represent the class. \nPredominance of the Common Questions \nThe circumstances of the false arrest of the class members was virtually identical, as all \narrestees were detained in Pershing Park at the same location as a group in one singular police \naction against the class members collectively, were arrested and taken into custody in the same \nsingular police action at the same time and as a group, and were confined in common or similar \nharsh conditions. Though some plaintiff class members may have suffered a type of injury that \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 3    Filed 02/07/03   Page 5 of 10\nothers did not, such as the deprivation of access to medication for a condition not generally \nsuffered by others, the overwhelming majority of injuries were similar or suffered in common. \nThe common questions of law and fact bearing upon the lack of probable cause or lawful \njustification to arrest, not questions of unique injury, are the predominant questions presented. \nAccording to Peter Lavalee, the D.C. Corporation Counsel's communication director as \nquoted in the Washington City Paper, \"We no-papered everything in Pershing Park. We did not \nfeel in the cases that came from Pershing Park - that the witness statements and the evidence that \nwe had [presented] probable cause that a crime was committed and/or that a specific individual \ncommitted a crime.,,1 \nTo plaintiffs' knowledge, no other litigation has been commenced concerning class \nclaims.  Chang, et al. v. District ofC  olumbia, et al., 02-CV -02010 has been filed, which arises \nout of the same events, and presents individual claims of seven George Washington University \nstudents who were falsely arrested. \nConcentration of the class action in this Court would be appropriate, as it would be \nconvenient for the defendants. Plaintiffs, many from within the District and others from outside \nthe District, briefly converged in Pershing Park and are now dispersed around the country. \nHence, there is no alternative forum that would be more convenient for the plaintiff class. \nPlaintiffs foresee no difficulty in managing the case as a class action, which is \nadvantageous in terms ofj udicial and litigation economy. \nJason Cherkis, \"Boss Hogtie: Police Chief Charles Ramsey had a plan for the more than \nI \n400 people in Pershing Park last September: Arrest them all, detain them for hours, and then tie \nthem wrist to ankle for 12 hours. He says he'll do it again,\" The Washington City Paper, January \n17-23,2003 at 20, 23. \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 3    Filed 02/07/03   Page 6 of 10\nProposed Method of Notice \nPlaintiffs' proposed method of notice, fIrst class mail, with plaintiffs bearing the expense, \nis proper. Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156 (1974). Since plaintiff class members were \ndefendants' arrestees and prisoners, whose identity information was required to be recorded on \nstandard processing and release forms, it is appropriate that defendants be ordered to provide \nplaintiffs available information concerning class members' identities and locations, so that \nplaintiffs may provide the best notice possible. \nWHEREFORE, for the reasons set forth above, plaintiffs respectfully request that their \nmotion be granted. \nResp  ~ submitted, \n,7l!~~ \nCar Messmeo (#450033) \nMara Verheyden-Hilliard (#430031) \nZachary Wolfe (#463548) \nPARTNERSHIP FOR CIVIL JUSTICE, INC. \nNATIONAL LA WYERS GUILD \nMASS DEFENSE COMMITTEE \n1901 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW \nSuite 607 \nWashington, DC 20006 \n(202) 530-5630 \n(202) 530-5634 - facsimile \nCounsel for Plaintiffs \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 3    Filed 02/07/03   Page 7 of 10\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \nJEFFREY BARHAM, ET AL. \nPlaintiffs \nv.

Action No. 02-2283 (EGS)\nv. )\n)\nCHARLES RAMSEY, et al.,  )\n)\nDefendants. )\n                              )\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\nThis case arises from arrests in Pershing Park on September\n27, 2002 during demonstrations in connection with World Bank and\nInternational Monetary Fund meetings in Washington, D.C. \nPlaintiffs represent a class of individuals who were arrested\nduring the morning of the demonstrations.  Plaintiffs claim\nviolations of their First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendment\nrights, as well as false arrest, imprisonment, and conversion. \nPending before the Court is the defendants’ motion to propound\nlimited written discovery to the absent class members.  Upon\nreview of the motion, response and reply thereto, the applicable\nlaw, and the entire record, the Court DENIES defendants’ motion.\nI. BACKGROUND\nThe D.C. Circuit’s January 13, 2006 opinion details the\nevents at Pershing Park on the morning of September 27, 2002, the\naftermath of such events, and the involvement of the District of\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 358      Filed 11/08/2007     Page 2 of 13\nColumbia Metropolitan Police Department (“MPD”).  See Barham v.\nRamsey, 434 F.3d 565 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  This Court’s July 10,\n2007 Memorandum Opinion details the involvement of the federal\ndefendants1 in those same events.  The District of Columbia\ndefendants (“District defendants”) and the federal defendants now\nboth move the Court to allow written interrogatories to be\npropounded to the absent class members in this litigation.  While\nthe District and federal defendants have filed separate motions,\ntheir arguments and proposed interrogatories are virtually\nidentical.  The plaintiffs have filed a joint opposition and\ndefendants filed a joint reply.  Thus, the motions will be\naddressed concurrently in this opinion. \nDefendants seek information regarding the absent class\nmembers’ activities and experiences before, during, and after\ntheir arrest at Pershing Park and their subsequent confinement. \nSpecifically, defendants want to know the details regarding the\nabsent class members’ participation in any demonstration\nactivities before they entered Pershing Park on September 27,\n2002; any physical or physiological injuries sustained or\n1 The federal defendants include:  the United States; Gale\nNorton, Director of the National Park Service, in her official\ncapacity; Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, in his official\ncapacity; Richard Murphy, acting Commander of the Special Forces\nBranch of the U.S. Park Police, in his official and individual\ncapacity; and unidentified officers, supervisors, and law\nenforcement agencies, in their official and individual\ncapacities.\n2\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 358      Filed 11/08/2007     Page 3 of 13\nproperty loss that occurred as a result of being arrested at\nPershing Park; and any effects the experience may have had on the\nclass members’ plans to participate in any future demonstrations.\nSee Dist. Def.’s Mot., Ex 1; Fed. Def.’s Mot. Ex. 2.  Defendants\ncontend this information is \ncritical  to  determine  whether  the  police  defendants\nintentionally conspired to arrest almost 400 people at\nPershing Park in order to execute unlawful preemptive\narrests for the purpose of taking off the streets persons\nwho  were  at  all  times  acting  lawfully  so  the  class\nmembers could not exercise their First Amendment Rights,\nor whether, as the defendants contend, the police were in\ngood  faith  attempting  to  cope  with  roving  groups  of\ndemonstrators  who  unilaterally  took  to  the  streets\nwithout permits or other lawful authorization.... \nDistrict Def.'s Mot. at 11.  Plaintiffs oppose the motion on the\ngrounds that defendants have not met the standards which\nauthorize discovery against absent class members in our circuit.\nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 governs the\nadministration of class action lawsuits and provides for the\nefficient and fair administration of controversies where the\nclass suing or to be sued is sufficiently numerous, shares common\nclaims, and is adequately represented by named plaintiffs whose\nclaims are typical of the rest of the class. See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n23(a).  The rule envisions a “truly representative suit to avoid,\nrather than encourage, unnecessary filing of repetitious papers\nand motions.” American Pipe & Const. Co. v. Utah, 414 U.S. 538,\n3\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 358      Filed 11/08/2007     Page 4 of 13\n550 (1974). “It is undisputed that the purpose of Rule 23 is to\nprevent piecemeal litigation to avoid both a multiplicity of\nsuits on common claims resulting in inconsistent adjudications\nand the difficulties in determining the res judicata effects of a\njudgment.”  Donovan v. University of Texas at El Paso, 643 F.2d\n1201, 1206 (5th Cir. 1981).\nFederal Rules 33 and 34 regulate discovery.  While discovery\nagainst absent class members under Rules 33 and 34 cannot be had\nas a matter of course, the “evolving view” is that the Court has\nthe power under its authority to manage class actions under Rule\n23(d)2 to permit reasonable discovery when the circumstances of\nthe case justify it. United States v. FEOC Trucking Employers,\nInc., 72 F.R.D. 101, 104 (D.D.C. 1976)(allowing limited discovery\nupon a showing of necessity).  In Dellums v. Powell, 566 F.2d 167\n(D.C. Cir. 1977), the defendant did not engage in any pre-trial\ndiscovery nor did it ask the Court to certify subclasses.  The\nD.C. Circuit rejected defendant’s request for post-trial\ndiscovery of the absent class members, though opined that\ndiscovery of absent class members would be permissible in certain\ncases.  Specifically, the Court declared that discovery against\nabsent class members could not be had as a matter of course, but\n2 Rule 23(d)(5) empowers the Court to make appropriate\norders to deal with procedural matters in class actions.  See\nF.R.C.P. 23(d)(5).\n4\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 358      Filed 11/08/2007     Page 5 of 13\nmay be had “relevant to the decision of common questions, when\nthe interrogatories or document requests are tendered in good\nfaith and are not unduly burdensome, and when the information is\nnot available from the representative parties.” 566 F.2d at 187. \nIn a related case, the Circuit warned that discovery against\nabsent class members “can be a tactic to take undue advantage of\nthe class members... and further that Rule 23... contemplates\nthat absentee parties shall remain the passive beneficiaries of\nclass suits, [therefore] courts have found it necessary to\nrestrict availability of discovery against absentees to those\ninstances in which a need can be shown.”  Dellums v. Powell, 566\nF.2d 231, 236 (D.C. Cir. 1977)(internal citations omitted). \nFinally, the Manual for Complex Litigation explains that “[o]ne\nof the principal advantages of class actions over massive joinder\nor consolidation would be lost if all class members were\nroutinely subjected to discovery.”  Federal Judicial Center,\nManual for Complex Litigation (Fourth) (2004) § 21.41 at 302.  \nIII. ANALYSIS\nDefendants insist that discovery against the absent class\nmembers is critical to their right to a fair trial and seek leave\nto propound 27 interrogatories to the 281 class members who have\nbeen identified based upon MPD arrest records for Pershing Park\nfor September 27, 2002.  While defendants concede that both this\n5\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 358      Filed 11/08/2007     Page 6 of 13\nCourt and the Court of Appeals have determined that the arrests\nat Pershing Park were unlawful, Dist. Def.’s Mot. at 11 (citing\nBarham v. Ramsey, 434 F.3d 565, 568 (D.C. Cir. 2006)), they\ncontend that discovery is critical to the resolution of multiple\nissues, namely: whether defendants intentionally conspired to\nunlawfully arrest people, whether police motivation was malicious\nand conspiratorial, whether the actions of the protestors\njustified police action, whether the great majority of persons\narrested were not directed or forced into the park by police but\nrather voluntarily entered the park after unlawfully marching\nthrough the streets; and whether the named representatives fairly\nrepresent the class, or, as defendants allege, that most people\nforced into the park were not political activists, but rather\nbystanders, observers, or non-demonstrators. See Dist. Def.’s\nMot. at 11-14.  In addition to the above claims, the federal\ndefendants also allege that class discovery is necessary to\nestablish that the federal defendants came to Pershing Park for a\nlegitimate law enforcement purpose and thereafter rendered lawful\nassistance in response to such a request by the MPD.  Fed. Def.'s\nMot. at 12.  Finally, all defendants argue that class members’\nactivities before, during, and after their arrests are critical\nto a determination of damages in this case.  Dist. Def.’s Mot. at\n14; Fed. Def.’s Mot. at 17.  \n6\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 358      Filed 11/08/2007     Page 7 of 13\n The Court agrees that in certain circumstances, discovery\nagainst absent class members may be permitted. See Dellums v.\nPowell, 566 F.2d 167 (D.C. Cir. 1977); United States v. FEOC\nTrucking Employers, Inc., 72 F.R.D. 101 (D.D.C. 1976); Disability\nRights Council v. WMATA, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63424 (D.D.C.\n2006).  However, the Court finds that the circumstances of this\ncase do not warrant this unusual measure. \nIn United States v. FEOC Trucking Employers, the United\nStates sought relief under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964 for discrimination in the trucking industry.  72 F.R.D at\n104.  In evaluating plaintiff’s request for discovery against\nabsent defendant class members, the Court declared that discovery\ncould be had only when the circumstances of the case justify such\naction. \nThe most important relevant circumstances are that the\nparty seeking the discovery must demonstrate its need for\nthe discovery for purposes of trial of the issues common\nto the class, that the discovery not be undertaken with\nthe  purpose  or  effect  of  harassment  of  absent  class\nmembers or of altering the membership of the opposing\nclass,  and  that the interrogatories  be restricted  to\ninformation directly relevant to the issues to be tried\nby the Court with respect to the class action aspects of\nthe case.\nId.  The Court allowed discovery against defendant absent class\nmembers because the Court determined the information sought was\nnecessary to the trial of common class issues and neither\nplaintiffs nor the named defendants had the information. Id. at\n104-05.  \n7\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 358      Filed 11/08/2007     Page 8 of 13\nIn the instant case, defendants have not made a showing of\nnecessity.  Defendants have proposed 27 interrogatories for the\nabsent class members which concern the class members’ activities\non September 27, 2002 and beyond.  Specifically, interrogatories\n1-15 inquire into the class members’ activities prior to their\narrest, and include questions regarding whether class members\nwalked on streets or sidewalks, whether they obeyed traffic laws,\nwhether they believed it was legal to walk or ride in the street,\nthe route class members walked or rode to reach the park, and the\napproximate number of people class members observed walking or\nriding in the street.  Def.’s Interrogatories, p. 7-9. \nDefendants contend this information is crucial to defend against\nplaintiffs’ claims, and that it specifically speaks to the\nexistence of a police conspiracy, unlawful police motivation, and\njustification for the mass arrest.  Def.’s Reply at 16. \nPlaintiffs respond that this information is not necessary because\nthey have not averred civil conspiracy on behalf of the class and\nthat defendants’ other arguments in support of discovery are\nnothing more than post-hoc justification for arrests already\ndeclared unlawful.  Pl.’s Opp’n at 3, 6. \nThe Court is not persuaded this information is necessary, or\neven relevant, to the officers’ motivation on September 22, 2007. \nAbsent class members cannot testify to the state of mind of the\ndefendants, nor can they speak to whether defendants agreed to\n8\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 358      Filed 11/08/2007     Page 9 of 13\ndeprive plaintiffs of their constitutional rights.  Rather, only\ndefendants can present this information to the jury.    \nDefendants further contend that this information is\nnecessary to establish that “there was a real, significant and\nunlawful incident of roving demonstrations in the streets...\nwhich precipitated the arrests in Pershing Park....”  Def.’s\nreply at 5.  Again, defendants have failed to show necessity.  No\none disputes the presence of demonstrators in the District of\nColumbia on September 27, 2002.  Defendants have access to\nhundreds of officers who can testify to their own observations of\nany lawlessness that may have taken place.  This information is\nnot unavailable from other sources such that only the absent\nclass members can provide it. C.f. FEOC Trucking Employees, 72\nF.R.D. at 105.  Furthermore, whether or not absent class members\nparticipated in any such acts is irrelevant at this point,\nbecause this Court and the Court of Appeals have already\ndetermined that defendants lacked probable cause to arrest all\nthe people in Pershing Park, whether or not specific individuals\namong them may have engaged in any earlier unlawful activity. 338\nF.Supp.2d 48, 58 (D.D.C. 2004) aff’d by Barham v. Ramsey, 434\nF.3d 565, 576 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  \nInterrogatories 16-27 inquire into the class members’\nexperience of the arrest itself and any potential injuries they\nmay have suffered.  Defendants claim these questions are\n9\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 358      Filed 11/08/2007     Page 10 of 13\nnecessary to determine damages, stating that, “given the\ndecisions rendered by this Court and the Court of Appeals,\ndamages may be the major issue in the trial of this case.” \nDef.’s Reply at 8.  However, inquiries into individual damages\nare not issues “common to the class” as Dellums requires.  566\nF.2d at 187.  As plaintiffs point out, there have been multiple\ngroups of settlement pertaining to the September 27, 2002 arrests\nand in not one of those settlements or related offers of judgment\nhas there been an individualization of damages on any basis.\nPl.’s Opp’n at 14 (citing Settlement Agreement [doc. no. 99] in\nJulie Abbate, et al. v. Chief Charles Ramsey, et al., Case No.\n03-0767 (EGS); Joint Praecipe Regarding Accepted Offer of\nJudgment [doc. no. 306] in Jeffrey Barham, et al., v. Charles\nRamsey, et al., Case No. 02-2283 (EGS); Notice of Acceptance of\nOffer of Judgment by Enright [doc. no. 144], Notice of Acceptance\nof Offer of Judgment by Chastain and Young [doc. no. 190] in\nRayming Chang, et al. v. United States of America, et al., Case\nNo. 02-2010 (EGS)).  While the settlement of related cases is\ncertainly not dispositive of a damage calculation in this case,\nit does undermine defendants’ contention that an individualized\nassessment of damages is the only means of resolution to\nplaintiffs’ claims.   \nDefendants also rely on Disability Rights Council v. WMATA,\n2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63424.  There, the Court allowed limited\n10\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 358      Filed 11/08/2007     Page 11 of 13\ndiscovery against the absent class members who had submitted\nwritten complaints against WMATA’s “MetroAccess” service for\ndisabled riders.  The Court found that “because these statements\nwill be relied upon and because these customers may be witnesses,\nWMATA has the right to discovery beyond what the absent class\nmembers have said to establish the factual incorrectness of what\nwas said or to see if their experiences were frequent or\naberrational.” Id. at 5.  The circumstances in the instant case\nare distinguishable.  First, the WMATA absent class members had\naffirmatively come forward and submitted declarations detailing\ntheir individual experiences of dissatisfaction, effectively\nchoosing to be part of the litigation.  Second, unlike in the\ninstant case, liability rested upon those declarations.  Here,\nliability has all but been decided and the Court has already\ndetermined that the class members’ pre-arrest activities are\nirrelevant to whether defendants had probable cause to arrest\nthem.\nFinally, defendants allege that the conduct and testimony of\nthe 17 named class representatives is not representative of the\nalmost 400 members of the class.  Dist. Def.’s Mot. at 16. \nDefendants argue that plaintiffs “should not be allowed to try\ntheir case to the jury on the...anecdotal testimony of the 17\nclass representative plaintiffs, who have been selected by\nplaintiffs’ counsel.”  Id.  The Court has already certified this\n11\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 358      Filed 11/08/2007     Page 12 of 13\nclass, and in so doing found, as it was required to do under Rule\n23(a), that “the claims or defenses of the representative parties\nare typical of the claims or defenses of the class, and the\nrepresentative parties will fairly and adequately protect the\ninterests of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  Defendants\napparently believe this class was improperly certified and argue\nthat discovery against absent class members is somehow a remedy\nfor this error.  The Court is confident in its prior\ncertification ruling and rejects defendants’ argument.  \nIn addition to the above, the federal defendants contend\nthat discovery against the absent class members is necessary to\nestablish that the federal defendants came to Pershing Park for a\nlegitimate law enforcement purpose and thereafter rendered lawful\nassistance in response to such a request by the MPD.  Fed. Def.'s\nMot. at 12.  The Court rejects this argument for substantially\nthe same reasons articulated above.  The federal defendants have\nfailed to show the necessity of this information and that this\ninformation is unavailable from other sources.  Furthermore, it\nis doubtful the absent class members can provide this information\nat all.  Defendants’ own witnesses are the proper parties to\nspeak to the federal defendants’ “law enforcement purpose” or any\nrequests made by the MPD. \n12\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 358      Filed 11/08/2007     Page 13 of 13\nIV. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court finds that the\ninformation sought in defendants’ interrogatories is not\nnecessary to defendants’ case, nor is it unavailable from the\nrepresentative parties.  Because these are sufficient grounds\nupon which to deny defendants’ motion, the Court will not reach\nplaintiffs’ allegations of bad faith and intent to delay the\nlitigation.  Defendants’ motion to propound written discovery to\nabsent class members is therefore DENIED.  An appropriate order\naccompanies this memorandum.  \nSigned: Emmet G.

R. Civ. P. 23 and due process requirements. \nPlaintiffs address below the equitable relief that has issued through settlement and legislative \naction to effectively change the landscape, both practically on the streets and legally in the courts \nand under law, as pertains to police conduct during mass demonstrations.  \nThe monetary relief is fair, reasonable and adequate, resulting in payments to class \nmembers that is around three times that received by class members who claimed identical \ndamages in the same conditions of confinement for September 27, 2002 protest-related arrests in \nthe case of Burgin v. District of Columbia, Civil Action No. 03-02005 (EGS). \nThe attorneys fees, likewise, are reasonable. \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 595-1   Filed 03/05/10   Page 2 of 34\nThe plaintiffs submit, herein, proposals to direct class notice in a reasonable manner to all \nclass members who would be bound by the proposal, including opportunity for class members to \nrequest exclusion from the monetary terms of settlement. \nA copy of the Settlement Agreement is attached herein as Exhibit 1. \nI.  The Settlement Agreement is Fair, Reasonable and Adequate \n \nA.  Equitable Relief \n \nThe Court certified the Barham class pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), on the basis of \nclaims  that  “by  arresting  all  persons  found  in  [Pershing]  park  on  the  morning  in  question  \n[September 27, 2002] without giving a lawful order to disperse or allowing class members to \nobey such order, defendants engaged in a singular police action on grounds generally applicable \nto  the  class.”  Barham v. Ramsey, 217 F.R.D. 262, 264. \nThe Court acknowledged that, while monetary claims for damages existed, the \npredominant issue was the uniform action by police against the class as a whole, specifically the \nquestion of whether civil rights violations were perpetrated by the execution of the mass arrest \nwithout any warning or order to disperse. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e). The most fundamental and \ndominant need was the prevention of recurrence. Barham, 217 F.R.D. at 264 (Court \nacknowledges  that  in  each  of  the  “related  case”  lawsuits  filed  pertaining  to  the  September 27, \n2002  arrests,  “[a]ll  four  actions  seek  common  relief  from  the  District  of  Columbia,”  specifically  \nequitable  relief  barring  the  use  of  police  lines  to  “trap  and  arrest”  protestors  and  others,  \nexpungement relief1 and damages). \n                                                 \n1   Upon motion of the District of Columbia (Barham Docket No. 386; Chang Docket No. 365), the Court \ngranted expungement relief to the Barham class (Barham Docket No, 405), to the four remaining Chang plaintiffs \n(Chang docket no. 381) and also issued to the four remaining Chang plaintiffs orders declaring the arrest of each to \nbe  “null  and  void”  and  authorizing  each  to  deny  the  occurrence  of  the  arrest  without  penalty  (Chang docket Nos. 382 \n– 385). Similar relief was issued in the settlement of the claims of the seven plaintiffs in Abatte v. Ramsey, Civil \nAction No. 03-00767 (EGS) (Docket No. 99). \n2 \n \n\n(cid:15) (cid:24) s(cid:27) (cid:1) (cid:5) (cid:14) (cid:4) (cid:6) (cid:2) (cid:25)1(cid:2) (cid:4) (cid:6) (cid:6) (cid:12) (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:17) (cid:19) (cid:23) (cid:2) (cid:20)(cid:21) (cid:18) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:16) a(cid:25)    (cid:27) Ce(cid:1) (cid:9) (cid:13) (cid:9) (cid:2) (cid:5) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:18) (cid:30)(cid:31)(cid:27) (cid:26) (cid:1) (cid:4) (cid:7) (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:9) (cid:3) (cid:5) (cid:4) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:22) (cid:24) (cid:29) (cid:27) (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:1) a(cid:28) (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:8)\nThe certified class was not restricted to protestors. The class represents the interests of all \nthose arrested, including protestors, non-protestors, journalists, bystanders, National Lawyers \nGuild legal observers, tourists, interested persons who approached to observe or hear  protestors’  \nmessage, and passers-by.2 \n1.    The Need for Equitable Relief: The Alleged Pattern and Practice Violations \nExisting at Time of Complaint \n \nPlaintiffs to this lawsuit, and other protest related lawsuits, have alleged that during a \nperiod of years starting with the April 15, 2000 arrests at issue in the matter of Becker, et al. v. \nDistrict of Columbia, et al., the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) engaged in a practice of \ntrapping and detaining protest groups, including in each of the following circumstances: \n  April 15, 2000, claim of trap and detain mass arrests at protests timed to coincide with the \nSpring annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. See Becker \nv. District of Columbia, Civil Action 01-00811 (PLF)(JMF) (class action with \nPartnership for Civil Justice Fund (PCJF) as class counsel). \n \n  January 20, 2001, allegedly targeting protestors at the first Inauguration of George W. \nBush and engaging in trap and detention tactics. See International Action Center, et al. v. \nUnited States, et al., Civil Action No. 01-00072 (GK) (plaintiffs represented by the PCJF \nattorneys). \n \n  Saturday, September 29, 2001, in Murrow Park in front of IMF headquarters. Protestors \nclaim that police lines allegedly appeared suddenly, trapping and detaining hundreds of \npersons without notice.  \n \n  April 22, 2002, at a march organized to raise awareness about U.S. policies towards Latin \nAmerica, District and federal police allegedly deployed police lines without warning and \nencircled, trapped and detained demonstrators. \n \n  September 27, 2002, mass arrest at protests timed to coincide with the Fall annual \nmeeting of the IMF and World Bank. Barham v. Ramsey, Civil Action 02-02283 \n(EGS)(JMF) (class action with Partnership for Civil Justice Fund as class counsel). \n \n                                                 \n2    As best as Class Counsel can determine, based on the record, there were no distinctions made in this \nsingular police action with the limited exception that some journalists were treated favorably and were allowed to \nleave the arrest area. \n3 \n \n\n(cid:15) (cid:24) s(cid:27) (cid:1) (cid:5) (cid:14) (cid:4) (cid:6) (cid:2) (cid:25)1(cid:2) (cid:4) (cid:6) (cid:6) (cid:12) (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:17) (cid:19) (cid:23) (cid:2) (cid:20)(cid:21) (cid:18) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:16) a(cid:25)    (cid:27) Ce(cid:1) (cid:9) (cid:13) (cid:9) (cid:2) (cid:5) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:18) (cid:30)(cid:31)(cid:27) (cid:26) (cid:1) (cid:4) (cid:7) (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:9) (cid:3) (cid:5) (cid:4) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:22) (cid:24) (cid:29) (cid:27) (cid:1) (cid:8) (cid:1) a(cid:28) (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:8)\n  March 22, 2003, at protests against the invasion of Iraq, marchers were allegedly trapped \nand detained by police lines suddenly deployed at the front and the rear of the march on a \ncity block in downtown D.C. \n \nThe Partnership for Civil Justice filed the class complaint in Barham as the most recent in \na  series  of  lawsuits  it  had  filed  to  challenge  the  “trap-and-arrest”  tactic,  describing  the  case  as  \nfollows in the complaint. \nThis complaint is the most recent in a series of lawsuits with a shared factual \nallegation: That the D.C. Metropolitan  Police  Department’s  Civil  Disturbance  \nUnits maintain and execute unconstitutional tactics to disrupt lawful protest and \nassembly including specifically the routine use of mobile police lines to interfere \nwith freedom of association, assembly, speech and free movement; and the use of \nadministrative detention, false imprisonment and false arrest tactics in which the \nCDUs will trap protesters (and others in physical proximity) on all sides, seize, \ndetain and arrest those trapped/seized in the absence of probable cause. \nFirst Amended Complaint at 3, ¶¶4 – 5 (Docket Number 16). \nThis  Court  recognized  and  described  that  “[t]he  heart  of  [plaintiffs’]  ‘trap  and  arrest’  \ncharge  is  that  police  cordoned  off  the  Pershing  Park  area,  essentially  ‘trapping’  the  protestors \nwithin the park, and then initiated a mass arrest without first warning the protestors that they \nmust  disperse  to  avoid  arrest.”  Barham v. Ramsey, 338 F. Supp.2d 48, 54 (D.D.C. 2004). \nWhere the trap-and-arrest tactic has led to custodial arrests, protestors assert that they \nwere held overnight in harsh conditions of confinement, bound wrist-to-ankle in a contorting and \npainful  position  that  prevented  extension  of  one’s  back,  deprived  access  to  food  and  water,  and  at  \ntimes to bathroom facilities, and often required to sit on buses for hours. Equitable relief was \nsought to prevent these conditions from occurring in the future. \n2.   The Claims for Equitable Relief Have Been Resolved \n \nAs reflected in the timeline above, the April, 2000 IMF/World Bank related mass arrest \nthat is the subject of the Becker class action was a predecessor incident to the September, 2002 \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 595-1   Filed 03/05/10   Page 5 of 34\nIMF/World Bank mass arrest. The subsequent September 2002 incident was challenged, with the \nsame class counsel, in this case of Barham v. Ramsey, Civil Action 02-02283 (EGS)(JMF). \nThe Partnership for Civil Justice Fund, whose attorneys were class counsel in both the \nBecker case and the Barham case, made a simultaneous demand for equitable relief in a \nsettlement demand letter dated June 29, 2004 and issued in both the Barham and Becker cases. \nBecause the alleged injuries and challenged tactics experienced in both cases were substantively \nsimilar if not identical in important respects,  each  class’  demands  for  equitable  relief  to  prevent  \nrecurrence were advanced in the same correspondence. These demands and their resolution are \ndescribed further, below. \nAs a consequence of this litigation, and other litigation and factors, the Council of the \nDistrict of Columbia authorized an investigation into pattern and practices of alleged misconduct \nby police in the context of mass demonstrations. After issuing a report containing many adverse \nfindings against the police and, in particular, with respect to Chief Ramsey, the Council enacted \nremedial  legislation,  the  “First  Amendment  Rights  and  Police  Standards  Act  of  2004,” D.C. Law \n15-532 (April 13, 2005), 52 DCR 2296.   \nThe legislative history of this Act reflects that one of the expressly stated legislative \npurposes was to eliminate the need for equitable relief to issue from this Court and to enact into \nstatutory law the reasonable equitable demands of plaintiffs to this litigation. \nBarham class counsel Mara Verheyden-Hilliard testified at the public hearing on the \nlegislation. Upon completion of Ms. Verheyden-Hilliard’s  testimony,  Judiciary  Committee  \nChairperson Kathy Patterson stated, and asked, as follows: \nOne of the things that we had looked at, in doing this legislation, was trying to \nbring an end to the [protest] lawsuits here, from the standpoint of taking \naway all the injunctive relief sought, or taking away the need for injunctive \nrelief. Let me just ask you . . . if this legislation as proposed today were the law of \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 595-1   Filed 03/05/10   Page 6 of 34\nthe District of Columbia tomorrow, would there still be injunctive relief needed, \nthat you needed to seek, in your view? \nMedia Exhibit A, Committee Chair Kathy Patterson, Council of the District of Columbia, \nCommittee on the Judiciary, Public Hearing, Bill 15-968, \"First Amendment Rights and Police \nStandards Act of 2004,\" (October 7, 2004) (emphasis added). \n \nMs. Verheyden-Hilliard  responded  with  a  qualified  “Yes,”  acknowledging  the  breadth  of  \nthe  Council’s  proposals  as  well  as  areas  for  modification  and  improvement.    Id. \nThe “First  Amendment  Rights  and  Police  Standards  Act  of  2004”  (Ex.  5)  became  \neffective law on April 13, 2005.  \nDuring the period from April, 2005 through January, 2010, there has been no recurrence \nof the use of police lines to engage in the mass trap-and-arrest  of  protestors.  The  plaintiffs’  \noriginal claims for prospective relief barring the trap-and-arrest practice have been resolved by \nthe fact that these tactics have not been repeated and by the First Amendment Rights and Police \nStandards Act of 2004, as well as by other equitable relief secured through settlements. \nThe  plaintiffs’  equitable  demands,  detailed  in  the  June  29,  2004  equitable  relief  demand  \nletter3 transmitted jointly on behalf of the classes in Barham and Becker, were not limited strictly \nto the use of police lines.  \nPlaintiffs presented not a minimal set of demands, but a comprehensive package of \ndemands that intruded on police operations as plaintiffs deemed necessary to protect \nconstitutional rights in light of alleged police misconduct and disruption to free speech activities.  \nThe expansive set of demands sought to address the following alleged practices: the use \nof police lines to surround, trap-and-arrest  protestors  and  others;;  arrests  based  on  “demonstrating  \nwithout  a  permit”;;  use  of  ineffective and/or unlawful protest dispersal orders; the conditions of \nconfinement and restraint imposed on persons arrested in protests; the practice of restraining \n                                                 \n3    Communications in settlement discussions are maintained as strictly confidential. As such, plaintiffs have \nnot included the demand letter as an attachment, but have requested and received from the District its permission to \nsummarize the demands for the purposes of this submission. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 595-1   Filed 03/05/10   Page 7 of 34\narrestees by using flexcuffs to bind wrist-to-ankle; to place objective limits on the lengthy \nduration of confinement before release, the effect of which allegedly kept protestors off of the \nstreets and unable to engage in protected activities; to prevent the delivery of misinformation \nregarding options for release, which plaintiffs assert appeared calculated to prevent protestors \nfrom  challenging  the  legality  of  their  arrests  by  telling  persons  that  unless  they  chose  to  “post  \nand  forfeit”  that  they  would  be  jailed  for  days  before  a  Judge  would  see  them.  The  demands  also  \nsought to impose public record-keeping and report-issuance requirements.  \nAs  above,  the  Council’s  enactment  of  the  “First  Amendment  Rights  and  Police  Standards  \nAct  of  2004”  was  crafted  to  address  the  relief  sought  by  plaintiffs.  A  comparison  of  the  \ncomprehensive package of equitable relief demanded by the Barham plaintiffs in litigation, to \nthat enacted by the Council is reflected in the following table: \nEquitable Demands by Barham Class (as  Statutory Enactment Under the First \nreflected in June, 2004 demand letter)  Amendment Rights and Police Standards \nAct of 2004 (Ex. 5) \nRestrictions on Use of Police lines.

It does not expire after three years, or at \nany time.  \nWith respect to enforceability, the Act itself provides that it may be used by plaintiffs in \ntheir  private  causes  of  action  in  litigation.  Section  117,  “Construction,”  provides  that  \n“[p]rovisions  of  this  title  are  intended  to  protect  persons  who  are exercising First Amendment \nrights in the District of Columbia, and the standards for police conduct set forth in this title may \nbe relied upon by such persons in any action alleging violations of statutory or common law \nrights.”  Ex.  5,  Sec.  117. \nThe Council rejected the need to enact a new and additional private right of action within \nthe Act, on the grounds that protestor-plaintiffs alleging false arrest and other violations had no \nobstacle to access to court jurisdiction under existing causes of action under common law, \nconstitutional law and statutes, including 42 U.S.C. §1983, which were invoked by the Barham \nplaintiffs and those in the related cases in the instant litigation. \nThe  Act  contained  a  section  that  generally  required  “all  relevant  MPD  personnel”  to  be  \nproperly  trained  in  the  “handling  of,  and  response  to,  First  Amendment  assemblies”  including  \n“instruction  on  the  provisions  of  this  [Act],  and  the  regulations  issued  hereunder.”  Ex.  5,  Sec.  \n115. \nHowever, class counsel had received multiple reports from persons seeking to engage in \nprotest activity about encounters with police officials who, notwithstanding this general training \nrequirement, allegedly gave them misinformation or allegedly simply did not know the \nfundamental details established by the Act. Accordingly, recognizing this as an area of \nsubstantive  deficiency,  plaintiffs’  counsel  has  sought  to  impose  through  the    Becker settlement \n11 \n \n\n(cid:15) (cid:24) s(cid:27) (cid:1) (cid:5) (cid:14) (cid:4) (cid:6) (cid:2) (cid:25)1(cid:2) (cid:4) (cid:6) (cid:6) (cid:12) (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:17) (cid:19) (cid:23) (cid:2) (cid:20)(cid:21) (cid:18) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:16) a(cid:25)    (cid:27) Ce(cid:1) (cid:9) (cid:13) (cid:9) (cid:2) (cid:5) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:18) (cid:30)(cid:31)(cid:27) (cid:26) (cid:1) (cid:4) (cid:7) (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:9) (cid:3) (cid:5) (cid:4) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:22) (cid:24) (cid:29) (cid:27) (cid:1) (cid:5) (cid:6) (cid:1) a(cid:28) (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:8)\nterms a more specific regimen of training that is sufficiently specific to remedy these \ncircumstances. See Ex. 4 (Settlement Agreement in Becker); See also, February 4, 2010 Order \n(Becker Docket No. 357) (granting preliminary approval to Becker Settlement Agreement). \nSupplementing  and  extending  the  Act’s  training  requirements,  in  the  proposed  class  \naction settlement reached in Becker v. District of Columbia, the class has sought, and the District \nhas  agreed  to  mandate,  that  commencing  not  later  than  120  days  following  the  Court’s  final  \napproval of settlement: \n  “[E]ach  District  of  Columbia  Metropolitan  Police  Department  (“MPD”)  officer  will  be  \nrequired to take training on the Standard Operating Procedures for Handling First \nAmendment Assemblies and Mass Demonstrations. The training records for this course \nwill  be  preserved  for  a  minimum  of  three  (3)  years.”  See Ex. 4, Proposed Becker \nSettlement Agreement, at 8. \n \n  “[T]he  MPD  shall  refer  each  police  officer  currently  assigned,  or  assigned  in  the  future,  \nto  responsibilities  encompassing  or  related  to  the  handling  of  First  Amendment  ‘mass  \ndemonstration’  activities  to  the  provisions of the First Amendment Rights and Police \nStandards Act of 2004, D.C.

Accordingly, the proposed Becker class \naction settlement requires that \nIn all situations in which, through mutual aid agreements or otherwise, the District \nof  Columbia  obtains  the  assistance  of  outside  law  enforcement  agencies  for \ndemonstration related duties, the MPD shall brief outside agency commanders of \nthe  requirements  of  the  MPD’s  Standard  Operating  Procedures  for  Handling  First  \nAmendment  Assemblies  and  Mass  Demonstrations  and  shall  assign  an  MPD \nofficer to each such outside agency unit. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 595-1   Filed 03/05/10   Page 13 of 34\nEx. 4, Proposed Becker Settlement Agreement at 9. \nA number of the Barham plaintiffs, in particular those non-class plaintiffs arrested in the \nvicinity of Vermont & K on September 27, 2002, were each charged with the offense of \n“parading  without  a  permit”  and  arrested  without  prior  warning  or  notice.  It  had  been  a  priority  \nto ensure that this charge, which plaintiffs have long asserted to be a non-arrestable civil \ninfraction, no longer be used by police to arrest and jail protestors. The issue was advanced in the \nBarham litigation in 2004 in which plaintiffs sought a Motion for Preliminary Injunction to \nEnjoin the District of Columbia from Arresting or Prosecuting Persons for Parading Without a \nPermit. (Barham Doc. No. 144). At the hearing on the motion, the District of Columbia \nannounced that as a matter of policy it would cease the practice of suddenly arresting protestors \nfor parading without a permit. See Barham Doc. No. 168 (denying the motion for preliminary \ninjunction  as  moot  in  light  of  District  counsel’s  representations  in  open  court). \nTo ensure that MPD officers know that parading without a permit is a non-arrestable \noffense, in an earlier (February, 2007) settlement of the non-class  Vermont  &  K  plaintiffs’  \nclaims in the Barham matter, the following equitable relief was agreed to by the District of \nColumbia: \nThe  Metropolitan  Police  Department’s  Mass  Demonstration  Handbook  and/or  its  \nsuccessor publication, in the event of a change of title, shall, within 120 days of \nthe entry of judgment  upon these terms  provide written notice that parading \nwithout a permit, demonstrating without a permit, and participating in a First \nAmendment assembly without a permit are not arrestable offenses. . . \nNotice of Acceptance of Offer of Judgment (Barham Doc. No. 302-1). \nExcessive use of force claims were not advanced by the plaintiff class in the Pershing \nPark litigation. Nevertheless, as affects the conduct of the Metropolitan Police  Department’s  \nhandling of mass demonstrations, the equitable relief that has issued since the time of the \nPershing Park incident addresses what plaintiffs in other demonstration cases have alleged to \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 595-1   Filed 03/05/10   Page 14 of 34\nhave been one cause of use of excessive force by the Metropolitan Police Department during \nmass demonstrations. \nPlaintiffs alleging use of excessive force in the Becker case, as well as at the January, \n2001 Presidential Inaugural Parade against protestors, asserted that the suspension by Chief \nRamsey of use of force reporting requirements during mass demonstrations sent a message to \nofficers that use of force need not be reported, and by logical extension, would not be \ninvestigated or disciplined. The District denies such allegations. \nAccordingly, in the resolution of the 2001 Inaugural litigation, in November, 2006, the \nplaintiffs represented by the Partnership for Civil Justice secured the following relief: \nThe  Metropolitan  Police  Department’s  Mass  Demonstration  Handbook  and/or  its  \nsuccessor publication, in the event of a change of title, shall be modified within \n120 days to state, in substance, that the requirement that an officer reports use of \nforce, as established in General Order 901.7, shall fully apply in the context of \nmass demonstration activity where the officer independently – rather than at the \ndirection of a superior officer – determines to apply force and such modification \nshall be reflected in CDU refresher training as well as the 40-hour [training] \ncourse. Where officers utilize force at the direction of a superior officer the \ncurrent provisions of the Mass Demonstration Handbook [regarding use of force \nreporting] shall apply. \nSee Settlement Agreement between District of Columbia Defendants and all Plaintiffs, \nCollectively at 3, International Action Center, et al. v. United States, et al., Civil Action No. 01-\n00072 (GK) (Doc. No. 340-1). \n \nThe alleged particular tactics that were in play and employed by the D.C. Metropolitan \nPolice Department in April 2000 and September 2002 and which were sought to be challenged \nthrough this litigation have now been addressed through settlement terms and legislative action. \n  The legislation combined with nearly a decade of hard-fought litigation and close judicial \noversight has worked successfully to protect the right to dissent and to engage in spirited and \nvigorous protest and free speech in public fora. \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 595-1   Filed 03/05/10   Page 15 of 34\n3.  Judicial Determination of the Unconstitutionality of the Barham Class \nArrests \n \nThe careful consideration and formal rulings of this Court, as affirmed by the D.C. \nCircuit, have established lasting judicial precedent that stands not only to protect the rights to \nfree speech of protestors in Washington, D.C., but across the nation. \nThese declarations of constitutional rights and standards are, in and of themselves, a \nsubstantial form of equitable and declaratory relief that accrue widespread benefit beyond the \nimmediate litigants. \nThis Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit provided a \ncritical and detailed articulation of the standards to be followed by police in the context of mass \ndemonstrations.  “[W]here  a  group  contains  persons  who  have  not  been  violent  or  obstructive,  \npolice may not mass arrest the demonstration as a group without fair warning or notice and the \nopportunity to come  into  compliance.”  Id., 338 F. Supp.2d at 58. The D.C. Circuit affirmed and \nadopted  the  standards  articulated  by  this  Court,  ruling  that  only  “when  compelling  circumstances  \nare present, the police may be justified in detaining an undifferentiated crowd of protestors, but \nonly after providing a lawful order to disperse followed by a reasonable opportunity to comply \nwith  that  order.”  Barham v. Ramsey, 434 F.3d at 575. \nThe judicial articulations of constitutional standards have been relied upon by protestor-\nplaintiffs advancing claims of mass false arrest against police in other jurisdictions and have \nbeen cited and relied upon by courts applying these standards to protect constitutional and free \nspeech rights. See, e.g., Fogarty v. Gallegos, 523 F.3d 1147, 1158 (10th Cir. 2008) (affirming \ndenial of qualified immunity to arresting officers in connection with anti-war protest and march \nin Albuquerque, New Mexico) (citing Barham v. Ramsey, 434 F.3d at 574); Beal v. City of \nChicago, Civil Case No. 04-2039 (N.D. Ill March 30, 2007) at 10, 12 (citing Barham v. Ramsey, \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 595-1   Filed 03/05/10   Page 16 of 34\n338 F. Supp. 2d 48, 58 (D.D.C. 2004)) (denying defendants’  motion  for  summary  judgment  on  \nfalse arrest claims in connection with anti-war march and rally at the Federal Plaza in Chicago, \nIllinois resulting in mass arrest); Hickey v. City of Seattle, Civil Action No. 00-1672, at 10 \n(W.D.  Washington,  December  13,  2006)  (“Barham v. Ramsey, 434 F.3d 565 (D.C. Cir. 2006) is \ninstructive  here”  in  the  opinion  granting  plaintiffs’  motion  for  summary  judgment  on the issue of \nprobable cause in connection with December 1, 1999 anti-World Trade Organization protests in \nSeattle, Washington). \n  B.  Expungement Relief \n \nExpungement and annulment relief was granted by Court Order dated January 28, 2008 \n(Doc.  No.  405).  Among  other  relief  set  forth  in  that  Order,  the  Court  did  declare  that  “The  arrests  \nof the Barham Plaintiffs and the absent class members are hereby declared null and void. Each of \nthe Barham plaintiffs and the individual absent class members is authorized to deny the \noccurrence of his or her arrest that day without being subject to any penalty of perjury, fraud or \nother offense premised upon misrepresentation or deception in response to any inquiry, whether \nposed orally or in writing. These rights accrue to the full benefit of any absent class member \nregardless  of  whether  an  individualized  entry  of  a  nullification  order  [see  below]  is  entered.”  \nThe proposed Barham settlement will provide that each class member be issued an Order \nas above. See, Ex. 1, Settlement Agreement at 8. \n  C.   Monetary Relief \n \nThe monetary relief proposed for each Barham class member is structured around a \nbaseline expectation of 75% or lesser participation rate. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 595-1   Filed 03/05/10   Page 17 of 34\nIn the event that the participation rate is 75% or lesser, each class member shall receive a \npayment of $18,000. In the event that the participation rate exceeds 75%, the compensation \namount will be reduced on a pro-rata basis. See Ex. 1, Settlement Agreement, at 5. \nThe Barham class member recovery is, therefore, between 250% and 350% greater per \nclaimant than was recovered by the class members in Burgin v. District of Columbia, Civil \nAction No. 03-02005 (EGS) (Docket No. 65). The Burgin arrestees were arrested on the same \nday as the Barham arrestees and the majority merged together for the purposes of confinement. \nIn other words, as a class, the Burgin arrestees from Vermont and K suffered identical injury and \nidentical conditions and durations of confinement as the Barham arrestees. The Burgin class \nmember recovery of no more than $6,000 per claimant was deemed fair, reasonable and \nadequate5 for the same injuries as experienced by the Barham class members, who would each \nreceive up to $18,000 in compensation. \nThe monetary terms of the proposed class settlement in Barham are similarly, and \ncomparably, structured to the monetary terms of the proposed class settlement in Becker, which \nencompasses the claims of nearly 700 persons arrested in Washington, D.C., on April 15, 2000, \nwhich has received preliminary approval. See Ex. 4 (Settlement Agreement in Becker); See also, \n                                                 \n5\n   The settlement of claims in Burgin v. District of Columbia, Civil Action No. 03-02005 (EGS) (Docket No. \n65) (preliminary approval order) established a fund of $720,000 to be divided on an equal basis between claimants. \nSee Consent Motion for Preliminary Approval of Proposed Judgment and Distribution, Notice to Class, Fairness \nHearing, and Schedule, Burgin v. District of Columbia (Docket No. 60) at 4. The Burgin counsel estimated there to \nbe between 158 to 190 class members. At the time of the motion for preliminary approval, the Burgin counsel \nprojected the participation of 100 claimants, which would have led to a recovery of $7,200 each. Id. at 6. The Court \nDocket reflects there to have been 120 claimant expungement orders entered under seal on August 17, 2007, from \nwhich the undersigned infers there to have been no less than 120 claimants (it is unclear whether the 16 class \nrepresentatives are in addition to the figure of 120). Accordingly, in Burgin, the recovery per claimant was no more \nthan $6,000, which was deemed fair, adequate and sufficient for the identical injury as experienced by Barham class \nmembers. See also id. at 7 (Burgin counsel  preliminarily  projected  “each  Class  Member  who  timely  submits  a  claim  \n[will receive]  an  amount  ranging  from  about  $3,500  to  about  $7,000”). \n \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 595-1   Filed 03/05/10   Page 18 of 34\nFebruary 4, 2010 Order (Becker Docket No. 357) (granting preliminary approval to Becker \nSettlement Agreement). \nThe Settlement Agreement provides that the payments to class members are to be spread \nover two municipal fiscal years. Accordingly the first payment, which will be no less than sixty \npercent of that due to each class member, is to be funded by the end of September, 2010. The \nremainder is to be funded by no later than, and possibly earlier than, the end September, 2011. \nClass Representatives shall share equally in a fund that will provide each $50,000 in \ncompensation for their services on behalf of the class. This has been lengthy and hard fought \nlitigation, and the class representatives have engaged in extensive and repeated discovery, \nreturned to the area for deposition, and been available and have actively participated in the \nadvance of this lengthy litigation and negotiations. The amount of $50,000 is commensurate with \nthe most recent recoveries by individuals who have actively brought and advanced claims as \nindividuals for the same injuries. Class counsel views it as imperative that class representatives \nreceive compensation that is at least commensurate with that which they would likely have \nrecovered if they had advanced claims actively as individual plaintiffs over these past years. In \nthe absence of such commensurate recovery, there would be a severe disincentive for persons to \nserve as class representatives, a role which entails the same or greater activity as an individual \nplaintiff along with the additional fiduciary responsibilities and obligations in service to the class \nas a whole. Class Counsel represents that the class representatives have each served as stalwart \nadvocates on behalf of the class as a whole and have been essential to securing the exceptional \nresults for the benefit of the class overall. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 595-1   Filed 03/05/10   Page 19 of 34\n  D.  Judicially Enforced Document Management, Retention and Preservation \nObligations; Full Funding to Develop and Implement Document \nManagement System \n \nThe total monetary commitment the District of Columbia has made through the \nSettlement Agreement is potentially greater than just the $8,251,333 allocated for the Class \nSettlement Fund and includes an additional commitment of monies to implement a document \nmanagement system to prevent any recurrence of evidence loss/destruction. \nThe Settlement Agreement provides for funding for the Document Management, \nRetention, and Preservation Obligations for a period of three years, which may be extended by \nthe District for an additional two one-year periods to ensure continued funding. In other words, \nfunding as needed is established for up to a five-year period.  \nThese funds for this system are over and above the $8,251,333 allocated for the Class \nSettlement Fund and are authorized to be paid from the D.C. Judgment and Settlement Fund, \nwhich is a funding source within the District of Columbia municipal budget that provides fiscal \nresources to settle claims and lawsuits and pay judgments in most types of civil cases filed \nagainst the District of Columbia. It is an uncapped fund, and therefore this element of relief \nsatisfies two important characteristics: it provides full funding for the document management \nsystem and does not affect the availability of funds for settlements or judgments regarding other \nlawsuits against the District. \nThe District has, in the resolution of other class action lawsuits seeking systemic change, \npreviously funded systems needed to facilitate systemic equitable reforms by specifically \nproviding for such funding in the class action settlement agreement. For example, in the class \naction resolution of Bynum v. District of Columbia, the agreement provided for three million \ndollars for prison processing facilities development, the existence of which was needed to \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 595-1   Filed 03/05/10   Page 20 of 34\nprevent future instances of over-detention. Bynum v. District of Columbia, 412 F. Supp. 2d 73 \n(D.D.C. 2006). These commitments were properly considered in determining the total valuation \nof the settlement of claims. Id.  \nIn the Barham resolution, the distinction is that there is no particular dollar amount \nmaximum to the funding of the equitable relief, although the funding is obviously limited by the \nactual needs of the document management system and the terms of the Settlement Agreement. \nWithin those needs, the parties recognize that the largest financial and technical hurdles will \ncome in the first years of development and implementation of the document management system. \nThere will be significant one-time start-up costs. Technical start-up costs will exist for the \ndevelopment and implementation, from a systems perspective. Other costs, associated with \npersonnel training and the integration of the system into actual case operations, will be \nsignificantly greater during initial years of implementation. Once the use and benefits of the \nsystem become a part of operations, and personnel are properly trained, then of course the \nongoing per-year maintenance costs will not be encumbered by these front-end expenses. \n“The  parties’  intent   is   to  fully  fund,  through  this  agreement,  the  acquisition,  \ndevelopment and training costs for the Document Management System, which \nwould be expected to be greater in the initial years of implementation than in \nsubsequent  periods,  and  to  establish  funding  for  three  years,  or  as  may  be \nextended, a period of time believed to be amply sufficient for the use and benefits \nof  the  system  to  be  well  established.” \nEx. 1, Settlement Agreement at 17 – 18. \nThe  parties’  intent  is  that,  when  the  Settlement  Agreement  does  eventually  expire,  the  \nstart-up costs will have all been covered within the Agreement, the operating expenses during the \ninitial three- to five-year period will all have been covered, and the expected future financial \ncosts will accordingly be limited to maintenance costs. At that time, the use of the system will be \nincorporated into certain case management procedures and the benefits will be well established. \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 595-1   Filed 03/05/10   Page 21 of 34\nWhile budgeting will, of course, be needed to continue use of the system, the Agreement has \nbeen structured and funded to make the system long-standing, cost-effective and essential. \nThe Settlement Agreement provides for this Court to retain jurisdiction for three years for \npurposes of enforcement of the Document Management and Retention Requirements in the \nAgreement. See Ex. 1, Settlement Agreement at 18. \nThe District has also agreed to the series of requirements set forth below relating to the \nmandatory indexing, logging and preservation of evidence. \n1.   Commitment of Funds to Implement New Document Management System \n \nThe District has agreed to fund, using additional monies from the District of Columbia \nJudgment and Settlement Fund, a document management protocol or system the function of \nwhich is to prevent the recurrence of the destruction of evidence issues that were discovered in \nthe course of litigation.  Ex. 1, Settlement Agreement at 13. \n2.   Mandatory Indexing and Logging of Evidence \n \nUnder new policies mandated as terms of the Settlement Agreement, the District will now \nbe required to maintain an index, and to log, any documents, items, things, recorded or \nelectronic/computer/digitized material related to a complaint or litigation hold letter for matters \narising from mass demonstrations and protests. Ex. 1, Settlement Agreement at 9 – 10. \nThis is relief calculated to enforce indexing of evidence, to create an internal audit trail \nthat would alert the District to any missing records or evidence. Id. at 10. \n3.  Mandatory Evidence Preservation For Protest Related Claims  \n \nUnder  the  Agreement,  “the  OAG  shall  issue  policy  statements  mandating  that  upon  \nwritten notice of likely litigation and/or request to preserve documents and records pertaining to \nalleged police misconduct involving or relating to mass demonstrations or protests, the OAG \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 595-1   Filed 03/05/10   Page 22 of 34\nshall affirmatively direct in writing and ensure that all documents, records, items, videos or \ncomputer files relating to the underlying incident be preserved and affirmatively protected from \ndestruction  for  a  period  of  no  less  than  three  (3)  years.”  Ex.  1,  Settlement  Agreement  at  11. \n4.  Mandatory Preservation and Indexing of Radio Runs, Command Center \nRecords, and Other Computer Based Recordings or Data Records \n \nUnder the Agreement, upon any command or other system activation to assist in the \nmanagement  of  mass  demonstrations  and  protests,  “all  computer  files,  communications  \nrecordings / radio runs and documents reasonably related to the event shall be indexed and \npreserved  for  a  period  of  no  less  than  three  (3)  years.”  Ex.  1,  Settlement  Agreement  at  11 – 12. \n5.  Mandatory Preservation and Indexing of Photographic or Video Recordings \n \nUnder  the  Agreement,  “whenever  any  MPD  officer  is  assigned  to  (or  with  the  capability  \nto) engage in photographic or video recording or surveillance of mass demonstration activity or \nprotests;;  documentation  shall  be  maintained  reflecting  the  officer’s  name,  assignment,  the  \nequipment and recording media issued; and indexing and logging the return of all media. Upon \nthe return of any media, the officer shall document the dates, times, locations and events \nrecorded and affix such information to the media itself or secure to the container that contains the \nmedia.”  Ex. 1, Settlement Agreement at 12. \nThe Agreement is explicit that it does not authorize such  surveillance,  but  “is  intended  \nsolely to focus on indexing and record-keeping”  in  the  event  such  media  is  created.  Id. at 12. \n6.  Office of the Attorney General Required to Report to the Partnership for \nCivil Justice Fund, and to Issue Public Report to the Court, Every Six \nMonths During Enforcement Period \n \nAt six month intervals, for a period of three years, the District of Columbia is required to \nreport to class counsel at the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund regarding measures taken to \nperform the above-referenced system development, records indexing and maintenance \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 595-1   Filed 03/05/10   Page 23 of 34\nrequirements. The Partnership for Civil Justice Fund will have opportunity for review and \ncomment. The District shall be afforded an opportunity to consider these comments, after which \nthe final report will be submitted to the Court and published. The comments of the PCJF are \nrequired to be published within or as an attachment to the report. See Ex. 1, Settlement \nAgreement at 12 – 13.  \nThis is an oversight and reporting function that is intended to assure plaintiffs, the Court, \nand the public that the Document Management, Retention and Preservation goals of the \nSettlement Agreement are, in fact, advanced and achieved. \nII.  The Attorneys Fees are Reasonable \n \nWhen  awarding  attorneys’  fees,  the  court  has  a  duty  to  ensure  that  the  claim  for  \nattorneys’  fees  is  reasonable.  See Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433 (1983). \nThe Settlement Agreement provides an award of $2,463,333 to Class Counsel as \nattorneys’  fees  and  costs,  which  is  reasonable.  This  amount  was  determined  in  settlement  \nnegotiations after the amount of recovery to class members was negotiated, and reflects the \napplication of a percentage to certain monetary components in the agreement. The attorneys’ fees \nare  funded  and/or  allocated  separately  and  independent  of  the  claimants’  recovery.  As  such,  the  \naward of fees does not decrease the amount received by each claimant. 6 \n                                                 \n6    Technically,  the  Settlement  Agreement  does  not  create  a  true  common  fund.  “In  a  true  common  fund  case,  \nthe  attorneys’  fees  would  be  taken  from  a  fund  shared  in  common  with  class  plaintiffs;;  therefore, the amount \nrecovered  by  plaintiffs  is  reduced  by  the  amount  awarded  in  attorneys’  fees.”  Hensley v. Wade, 461 U.S. 30, *36 \n(1983). In  the  case  at  hand,  the  parties  established  a  separate  attorneys’  fee  fund.  Accordingly,  the  case  does  “not  \npresent the typical conflict of interest between class counsel and class members that underlies the application of the \npercentage of recovery method.”  Vitamins Antitrust Litig., U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25, 067, *38 (D.D.C. July 13 2001). \n  It  is  appropriate  to  consider  this  to  be  a  “constructive  common  fund”  case,  Vitamins Antitrust Litig., 2001 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 25067, at *36, and to analyze the size of the fund to be the gross settlement funds, inclusive of the \ntotal  funds  potentially  available  to  the  claimants,  administrative  costs  and  attorney’s  fees. \n  That there is a potentiality of unclaimed claimant funds reverting to the District, or being used for the \nbenefit of the class to pay the costs of a document management system to prevent future evidence loss, does not alter \nthe analysis. Herbert B. Newberg and Alba Conte, Newberg on Class Actions §  14.6  (4th  Ed.  2007  update)  (“[i]n  \nBoeing Co. v. Van Gemerty, [444 U.S. 156, 100 S. Ct. 745 (1980)] the Supreme Court settled this question [of \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 595-1   Filed 03/05/10   Page 24 of 34\nThe Class Settlement Fund, i.e., the gross settlement fund inclusive of administrative \ncosts  and  attorneys’  fees,  is  $8,251,333  plus unspecified additional monies as may be paid from \nthe D.C. Judgment and Settlement Fund as needed to create a new document management \nsystem and train staff. \nWhen calculating the percentage of the total settlement value that is accounted for in \nattorneys’ fees, the Court is to count the additional monies to fund equitable relief in determining \nthe valuation of the total settlement resolution. See Bynum, 412 F. Supp. 2d 73 (D.D.C. 2006) \n(counting the $3 million reverting to the District for purposes of facilities development as \ncomponent of total value of the settlement, which was $12 million with consideration of that \namount; approving attorneys fees of 33% plus expenses). \nIf one entirely excludes consideration of the monetary recovery attributed to the \ndocument management system relief, and considers the total monetary amount of the recovery to \nbe  $8,251,333,  the  percentage  of  attorneys’  fees  would  constitute  approximately  29%. \nIf one estimates the additional monies needed for procurement, implementation, training \nand operation of a new document management system to be one million dollars, the total \nmonetary amount of the settlement recovery would be $9,251,333, with the percentage of \nattorneys’  fees  therefore  constituting  approximately  26%  of  the  aggregate  fund. The D.C. Circuit \nholds  that  “the  proper  measure  of  such  fees  in  a  common  fund  case  is  a  percentage  of  the  fund.”  \nSwedish Hosp. v. Shalala, 1 F.3d 1261, 1263 (D.C. Cir. 1993). Many courts and commentators \n                                                                                                                                                             \nwhether class fund fees are based on the gross settlement or net settlement funds actually claimed] by ruling that \nclass counsel are entitled to a reasonable fee based on the funds potentially available to be claimed, regardless of the \namount  actually  claimed”);;  Williams v. MGM-Pathe Commun. Co., 129 F.3d 1026 (9th Cir. 1997) (reversing award \nof  attorney’s  fees  because  trial  court  failed  to  base  fee  award  on  the  entire  settlement, rather than the amount \nclaimed); Waters v. Int'l Precious Metals Corp., 190 F.3d 1291, 1295 (11th Cir. 1999) (distribution  of  attorneys’  fees  \nare to be based on the the funds available to eligible claimants, whether claimed or not; affirming a fee award nearly \ntwice the amount actually claimed by the class from the fund); Masters v. Wilhemina Model Agency, Inc., 473 F.3d \n423, 437 (the  “entire  Fund  .  .  .  is  created  through  the  efforts  of  counsel  at  the  instigation  of  the  entire  class”;;  an  \n“allocation  of fees by percentage should therefore be awarded on the basis of the total funds made available, whether \nclaimed  or  not”). \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 595-1   Filed 03/05/10   Page 25 of 34\nrecognize the percentage of the fund analysis to be the preferred approach in class action fee \nrequests because it more closely aligns the interest of the counsel and the class, i.e., class counsel \ndirectly benefit from increasing the size of the class fund and working in the most efficient \nmanner. Id. at 1266-67.  The  lodestar  approach  “encourages  significant  elements  of  inefficiency”  \nby  giving  attorneys  and  law  firms  “incentive  to  spend  as  many  hours  as  possible”  and  “a  strong  \nincentive  against  early  settlement.”  Id. \nIn the context of the Settlement Agreement, the line item for fees is separate and apart \nfrom the line items for payments to the class. Further, were there any reduction in fees, the \nreduction would likely return to the District of Columbia through reversion provisions that were \na necessary condition of settlement.  \nThe percentage in this case, fairly considered to be between 26 – 29% of the gross \nmonetary settlement value, is well within the range of reasonable fees in common fund cases. As \nthe D.C. Circuit surveyed the literature and cases,  it  found  “that  a  majority  of  common  fund  class  \naction  awards  fall  between  twenty  and  thirty  percent.”  Id. at 1272 ; See also Bynum, 412 F. \nSupp.  2d  at  85  (“A  1/3  fee  is  within  the  range  of  what  is  customarily  awarded  in  this  District.”);;  \nVitamins Antitrust Litig., 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25067, at *68-69 (awarding 34%); Federal \nJudiciary Center, Empirical Study of Class Actions in Four Federal District Courts: Final Report \nto the Advisory Committee on Civil Rules (1996) at 69, 90 (reports that most class action fee \nawards,  in  its  study  of  407  class  action  lawsuits,  “were  between  20%  and  40%  of  the  gross  \nmonetary  settlement”  and  that  “attorneys’  fees  were  generally  in  the  traditional  range  of  \napproximately one-third  of  the  total  settlement”);;  Silber  and  Goodrich, Common Funds and \nCommon  Problems:  Fee  Objections  and  Class  Counsel’s  Response, 17 RevLitig 525, 545-46 \n(1998) (reports results of a 1994 study by National Economic Research Associates that attorneys \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 595-1   Filed 03/05/10   Page 26 of 34\nfees in class actions averaged 32% of the recovery, regardless of case size, and averaged 34.74% \nwhen the fees and expenses were added together). \nThe Barham litigation has worked to ensure there would not be a recurrence of the trap-\nand-arrest tactics and other harmful police practices identified in the complaint. Substantial \nbenefits have been conferred upon the class beyond the monetary recovery, in terms of \nsignificant policy changes both in the area of restrictions on police tactics as well as \nimplementation of practices addressing document management and indexing procedures to \nensure a document audit trail. \nPlaintiffs believe that the results secured are exceptional.  \nThe proposed attorneys’ fee recovery reflects a compromise of attorneys’ fees incurred \nduring more than seven years of litigation. It is lower than the lodestar would be as calculated \nunder 42 U.S.C. §1988. As the Court is well aware, this has been hard fought, protracted, \ncomplex and resource-intensive litigation, as reflected in the size of the docket sheet printout \nwhich exceeds one hundred pages. There has been extensive and involved motions practice, \nincluding multiple dispositive motion briefings,7 which led to the interlocutory appeals of the \ndenial of qualified immunity by Peter Newsham and Charles Ramsey to the U.S. Court of \n                                                 \n7    See Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative for Summary Judgment, filed by Charles Ramsey, et al.

The Class Plaintiffs filed two \nmotions for preliminary injunctions, and eventually secured the relief sought in each.8 After \nextensive litigation the District conceded liability for common law false arrest. Discovery, which \nhas extended over a period of years, has been voluminous,9 protracted, contentious and the \nsubject of many contested motions.10  Ultimately, the loss and destruction of evidence itself \nbecame the subject of extensive investigation, motions to compel, briefings, and voluminous \nmotions for sanctions.11  \n                                                 \n8    Motion for Preliminary Injunction Enjoining the District of Columbia from Arresting or Prosecuting \nPersons for Parading without a Permit (Doc. No. 144); Motion for Preliminary Injunction Mandating That the \nDefendants Expunge the Arrest Records of Plaintiffs, and grant additional related relief (Doc. No. 145). \n9    Over 40,000 documents have been produced. There have been well in excess of 100 hours of radio runs \nproduced, often multiple versions (not copies) encompassing the same periods of time. Class Counsel estimates it \nrequired an average of 5 hours to closely review one hour of recorded radio communication, due to the poor quality, \nthe fading in and out of transmissions, the fact that overlapping or sequential transmissions can be initiated by any \nsource and (unlike a deposition) not sources easily identifiable or even known in advance, etc. There is a substantial \nvolume of video, as well. The extremely close examination of the radio runs conducted by Barham plaintiffs’  \ncounsel, which resulted in the identification of critical - - but latent and non-immediately apparent - - deficiencies or \nloss of data was exceedingly time consuming. There have, to date, been over 120 depositions in this case. Counsel \nhas also reviewed the 5,000+ pages of documents released by the D.C. Council upon conclusion of its investigation, \nreviewed the additional 11 depositions taken by the Council in executive session, as well as the multiple days of \nrelated public hearings, including those occurring on October 24, 2002, October 24, 2003, December 17 - 18, 2003 \nand October 7, 2004. \n10    Plaintiffs’  Motion  to  Compel  Against  Peter  Newsham  (Doc.  Nos.  248,  249,  251);;  Plaintiffs’  Memorandum  \nin Opposition to Motion to Stay Discovery Pending Resolution of Motion to Disqualify the Office of the Attorney \nGeneral, filed in Chang case (Doc.

These \nmatters may now be the subject of forensic investigation.  Class Counsel remains actively \ninvolved in these matters without additional remuneration. As the Court is aware, Class Counsel \nis committed to the pursuit of these matters, which is in the public interest as well as the \nplaintiffs’  interests. \nIn this resolution, Class Counsel has forgone any additional recovery of costs and \nexpenses. Class Counsel has also forgone recovery of additional fees attributed to necessary \nattorney services during administration of the class claims as well as the period of \nimplementation of the document management system which requires counsels’  ongoing \ninvolvement.  \nThe attorneys’ fees are reasonable as a percentage of the recovery, measured strictly in \nmonetary terms. The benefit to the  class  of  counsels’  services  is  far  greater  than  simply  the  \nmonetary relief as is evidenced by the substantial advancement of key constitutional rights issues \nand matters of public integrity in this litigation and the securing of meaningful and important \nequitable relief.  \nIII.  Proposed Notice, Opportunities for Exclusion or Opting Out of Monetary \nComponents of the Settlement, and Procedures for Notice and Hearing \n \nThe Settlement Agreement and proposed notice, and opportunity to opt out, appropriately \naccommodates the due process interests of class members to opt out of the monetary portion of \nthe class settlement. \n                                                                                                                                                             \nClass’  Renewed Motion for Sanctions, and Memorandum in Support, Against the District of Columbia and Against \nCharles H. Ramsey (Doc. No. 520; 522; 524; 534; 538; 539; 540; 544).  \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 595-1   Filed 03/05/10   Page 29 of 34\nThis Court certified the Barham class under Rule 23(b)(2). Barham v. Ramsey, 217 \nF.R.D. 262, 275. Certification under Rule 23(b)(2) is appropriate in civil rights lawsuits where \nequitable/injunctive relief is necessary to redress group injuries or to effect institutional reform \nthrough injunctive relief. Manual for Complex Litigation, Fourth, §21.142; See also Eubanks v. \nBillington,  110  F.3d  87,  92  (D.C.  Cir.  1997)  (“civil  rights  class  actions  are  frequently  certified  \npursuant  to  Rule  23(b)(2).”). \nA.  Opportunity to Opt Out of Monetary Relief \n \nThe  Settlement  Agreement  protects  class  members’  due  process  rights  and  affords  the  \nopportunity to opt out of the monetary claims or relief. The law distinguishes between relatively \nlimited opt out rights for equitable relief from the constitutionally required opt out rights for \nmonetary relief, which trigger jury entitlement rights. \nThere is no mandatory right to opt out of the prospective equitable relief that may issue in \na Rule 23(b)(2) class action. See Tricor Title Ins. Co. v. Brown, 511 U.S. 117, 121 (1994) (per \ncuriam); See also Bynum v. District of Columbia, 412 F. Supp. 2d 73, 77 (D.D.C. 2006) (Issuing \nfinal  approval  of  class  action  settlement,  pursuant  to  Rule  23(b)(2)  “regarding  prospective  relief,  \nno member of the class may opt-out.”);;  Manual  for  Complex  Litigation,  Fourth,  §21.142 \n(ordinarily,  “a  Rule  23(b)(2)  class  action  does  not  permit  opting  out”);;  See also Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(c)(2)(A) (no mandatory requirement that notice must issue to a class certified under Rule \n23(b)(2)). \n“Although  not  required,  this  Circuit  has  held  that  District  Courts  have  the  discretion  to  \ngrant opt-out  rights  in  class  actions  certified  pursuant  to  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  23(b)(1)  or  (2).”  Barham \nv. Ramsey, 217 F.R.D. 262, 274 (citing Eubanks, 110 F.3d at 94).  \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 595-1   Filed 03/05/10   Page 30 of 34\nA typical circumstance which may justify recognition of notice and opt-out rights in a \nRule 23(b)(2) class action, is where there are present demands for both equitable relief (which \nare resolved by the Court) and monetary relief (which may be resolved by jury), as is present in \nthe  instant  case.  “[W]here  both  injunctive  and  monetary  relief  are  sought,  the need to protect the \nrights of individual class members may necessitate procedural protections beyond those \nordinarily  provided  under  (b)(1)  and  (b)(2).”  Eubanks, 110 F.3d at 95; See also Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23 advisory  committee’s  note  (2003  amendments). \nConsistent  with  this  framework,  the  settlement  agreement  provides  that  “[n]o opt outs for \nthe  equitable  relief  are  allowed.”  See, e.g., Bynum, 412 F. Supp. 2d at 77 (Judge Lamberth \napproved class action settlement against District of Columbia, allowing opt-outs for monetary \nrelief  and  that  “regarding  prospective  relief,  no  member  of  the  class  may  opt-out.”). \nWith respect to monetary claims, however, the Settlement Agreement accords the full \nprovision of notice, equivalent to that which would be required were monetary claims certified \npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). \nB.  Notice \n \nThe substance of the notice satisfies all requirements for notice to a Rule 23(b)(3) class, \nwhich are the strictest and the fullest notice requirements of any class type. See Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(c)(2). See Exhibit 2 (Class Notice). \nClass Counsel has undertaken significant efforts to evaluate and determine the most \neffective and comprehensive manner of notice. The class is geographically diverse. Law \nenforcement arrest records created during the processing of hundreds of simultaneous arrests, are \nin many instances inaccurate and incomplete. The records, where they do exist, reflect addresses \nthat are at least seven years old. For some arrestee names, there is also social security or date of \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 595-1   Filed 03/05/10   Page 31 of 34\nbirth information, which can be used to update arrest information through public records \nsearches. Many arrestees are believed to be associated by topical and political and organizational \ninterests. Others may be regionally located. \nRather than rely only  on  the  MPD’s  Criminal  Justice  Information  System  (CJIS)  records,  \nClass Counsel is aggregating all sources of identity information produced in discovery, to \ninclude any arrest information produced by federal law enforcement, handwritten lists created \nduring arrest processing (i.e., transport logs or lists of persons released by posting a bond, etc.). \nThese multiple sources of information are to be produced to the Class Administrator, which is \nrequired to process each, either using optical character recognition software or hiring persons to \nreview and do manual data entry of all relevant fields of information into a central database. \nHaving aggregated the data, it will be de-duplicated and organized such that identity and contact \ninformation is accessible. \nThe Class Administrator will send a mailed notice and proof of claim form to all class \nmembers who can be identified through reasonable effort, including by first class mail to the last \nknown address of each class member. The United States Postal Service address forwarding \ndatabase and other public records sources will be used in efforts to update addresses. \nMultiple additional means will be used to reach class members by publication. \nAbbreviated forms of notice will be printed in the Washington Post and the Washington \nCity Paper. Each has a regional circulation and has also run articles pertaining to the protest, \ncourt proceedings or settlement which may cause interested persons to review them. \nThe class members are geographically diverse. Some, however, are connected by political \ninterests that drew them to the underlying protest activity. Notice will also be published in no \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 595-1   Filed 03/05/10   Page 32 of 34\nless than three periodicals/media outlets believed to be of topical interest to persons or \norganizations associated with the protests. \nClass counsel will also seek to have the notice announced on the web sites or e-mail lists \nof political or protest organizations whose constituency is believed to be among those \nparticipating at the protest. \nA stand-alone web site dedicated to class administration will be set up. The notice will \nalso be published/linked on the web sites of the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund and on the \nfront  page  of  the  Metropolitan  Police  Department’s  web  site  and  the  District  of  Columbia  Office  \nof  the  Attorney  General’s web site. These are sites that potential class members may visit \nseeking information. \nThe Class Administrator will also establish a toll free telephone line for inquiries from \npotential class members. Whether class members learn of the settlement through the newspaper, \nthe internet, or word of mouth, they will be able to pick up the phone and speak to a person if \nthey still have any questions. This is the best notice possible under the circumstances. The arrest \nrecords, where accurate and complete, are the best source for determining the identity of class \nmembers. The published notice is designed to reach class members through region-based \npublication and topically based publication. \nThe time period for responding to the notice (Ex. 2) and submitting a Proof of Claim \nform (Ex. 3) will be no less than 76 days from the date notice is initially mailed. This is of \nreasonable and sufficient duration. See, e.g., Bynum v. District of Columbia, 384 F. Supp. 2d \n342, 343 (D.D.C. 2005) (allowing 63 day period for class member responses); Burgin v. District \nof Columbia, Civil Action 03-02005 (EGS) (Docket No. 60) (71 days for response). \nThe timeline we anticipate is that initial notices will issue on or by April 30, 2010. \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 595-1   Filed 03/05/10   Page 33 of 34\nThere shall be an approximately ninety (75) day period in which Class Members will be \nrequired to submit a Proof of Claim Form. \nThe deadline to submit a claim, to request exclusion from the class, to file written \nobjections, and to file a Notice of Intent to be heard at the Fairness hearing will, for each, be July \n15, 2010 (requests/filings required to be received or postmarked by this date). \nThe Class Administrator will complete his report, and will prepare filings in advance of \nthe final approval / fairness hearing, with a due date of August 1, 2010. \nThe deadline for the parties to file responses to any objections will be September 1, 2010. \nThe parties jointly propose that the fairness hearing on September 15, 2010 or at a similar \ndate of the Court’s  selection. \nThe parties have jointly agreed upon, and propose, the firm of Gilardi & Co., L.L.C. to \nserve as Class Administrator. They are an eminently qualified and experienced class \nadministration firm. Their expertise and experience is described in the Gilardi & Co. firm \nmaterials, attached as Exhibit 6. \nIV.  Conclusion \n \nAfter seven years of litigation, and after multiple failed attempts at settlement/mediation \nover the years,12 the parties have come to terms. \nThis  settlement,  in  Class  Counsels’  view,  occurred  only  through  the  accumulated  \nincremental litigation victories and the advancement of key issues during the years of litigation \nincluding  that  of  the  past  year,  as  well  as  this  Court’s  involved  and  engaged  oversight. \n                                                 \n12    Settlement communications failed in 2004. The case was stayed from October 5, 2006 to allow for three \nmonths of mediation with George Cohen and Richard Hotvedt, appointed through the Mediation Program through \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. (Docket No. 294). Despite rigorous efforts, those \nfailed. The case was stayed on February 1, 2008, to allow private mediation before the Honorable Richard A. Levie. \nMediation not only failed, but led to substantial motions practice regarding the allocation of mediation fees. (Docket \nNos. 410, 411, 412, 414, 415, 417, 418, 421, 422, 423, 424, 425, 426). Settlement negotiations have, clearly, been at \narms-length. \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 595-1   Filed 03/05/10   Page 34 of 34\nThe terms that have been reached are, indeed, historic. They are substantial for plaintiffs \nand are a fair deal for the District. \nFor the reasons stated above, this Court should preliminarily approve the settlement, \nschedule a hearing for final approval, and approve the proposed form and manner of notice. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nPETER J.

Many of \nthose arrested were surrounded by police in the park, moved onto mass arrest busses, were in custody \nincluding overnight, and were restrained wrist-to-ankle with plastic “flexcuffs.” \n \n(cid:120)  The class is “all persons who were arrested in Pershing Park in the District of Columbia on September 27, \n2002.” There were protest-related arrests elsewhere on September 27, 2002 that are the subject of \nother suits. This settlement pertains only to the Pershing Park arrests. \n \n(cid:120)  The proposed settlement will provide up to $18,000 per class member in compensation. Attorneys fees will \nbe paid separately and will not be deducted from this amount. In addition, the arrests of class members will \nbe expunged and declared legally null and void. The class has demanded and the D.C. Government has \nagreed to and has imposed, substantial equitable relief and/or restrictions on police conduct to prevent \nrecurrence.  \n \n(cid:120)  Your legal rights are affected whether you act, or don’t act. Strict deadlines will apply.  \nYour Legal Rights and Options in this Settlement: \nThe only way to get a payment.  \nSubmit a Claim Form \nDeadline: July 15, 2010 \nGet no payment.

Why did I get this notice package? \nYou may be identified in law enforcement or government records as having been subject to the mass arrest that \nis the focus of this class action settlement. \nThe Court has directed that you be sent this notice because you have a right to know about a proposed \nsettlement of a class action lawsuit, and about all of your options, before the Court decides whether to approve \nthe settlement. If the Court approves it and after objections and appeals are resolved, if any arise at all, an \nadministrator will make the payments that the settlement allows. \nThis package explains the lawsuit, the settlement, your legal rights, what benefits are available, who is eligible \nfor them, and how to get them. \nThe Court in charge of the case is the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, and the case is \nknown as Barham, et al. v. Ramsey, et al., Case No. 02-CV-002283. The people who have sued are called the \nPlaintiffs and the persons and entities that have been sued are called the Defendants. \n2.  What is this class action lawsuit about? \nThe lawsuit asserts that the District of Columbia, the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, former Chief of \nPolice Charles H. Ramsey and former Assistance Chief of Police Peter J. Newsham and federal agents engaged \nin the false arrest of a class of individuals in Pershing Park on the morning of Friday, September 27, 2002. \nOn the morning of September 27, 2002 there were well publicized protests at multiple locations in Washington, \nD.C., timed to coincide with the Fall meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. \nHundreds  of  persons,  including  protestors,  tourists,  legal  observers,  bystanders,  journalists  and  others \ncongregated or were present within Pershing Park. By all accounts, the conduct in the park was peaceful. People \nwere “milling about” the park, many carried protest signs or symbols and some persons beat on drums. \nSome number of persons entered the park on, or with, their bicycle. A bicycle protest, which had initiated at the \nUnion Station train station, terminated at Pershing Park and many bike protesters entered the park. \nNo warnings or orders to disperse were issued to the persons who had assembled, or who were physically \npresent, within the park. Law enforcement used police lines to surround the park and denied persons the ability \nto leave. The MPD brought mass arrest busses to the park. From the southeast corner of the park, near a set of \nsteps leading down from the park to the sidewalk, police loaded persons onto the busses and transported them \naway. \nThe Class claims assert that the mass arrest in Pershing Park on September 27, 2002 violated the Constitution of \nthe United States, including the First and Fourth Amendment rights of those arrested. It is also asserted that the \narrest violated Class Members’ rights under District of Columbia law to be free of false arrest and that the arrest \nconstituted false imprisonment under District of Columbia law. \nMoney damages, equitable relief (or rule/policy reform) including expungement of arrest records, and attorneys \nfees and costs have been sought against these defendants on behalf of the class. \n3.  Does the class action involve persons who were arrested that day, including in protest-related arrests or \nmass arrests, at locations other than Pershing Park? \nNo. \nThe Barham class action only involves those arrested at Pershing Park. \nDifferent lawsuits, including class action claims, have been advanced on behalf of persons arrested in other \nspecific locations. A different and separate class action has been advanced on behalf of an estimated 150 \n(cid:20)(cid:151)(cid:135)(cid:149)(cid:150)(cid:139)(cid:145)(cid:144)(cid:149)(cid:491)(cid:3)(cid:6)(cid:131)(cid:142)(cid:142)(cid:3)(cid:883)(cid:486)(cid:890)(cid:889)(cid:889)(cid:486)(cid:888)(cid:889)(cid:890)(cid:486)(cid:882)(cid:889)(cid:885)(cid:888)(cid:3)(cid:150)(cid:145)(cid:142)(cid:142)(cid:3)(cid:136)(cid:148)(cid:135)(cid:135)(cid:481)(cid:3)(cid:145)(cid:148)(cid:3)(cid:152)(cid:139)(cid:149)(cid:139)(cid:150)(cid:3)(cid:153)(cid:153)(cid:153)(cid:484)(cid:19)(cid:135)(cid:148)(cid:149)(cid:138)(cid:139)(cid:144)(cid:137)(cid:19)(cid:131)(cid:148)(cid:141)(cid:22)(cid:135)(cid:150)(cid:150)(cid:142)(cid:135)(cid:143)(cid:135)(cid:144)(cid:150)(cid:484)(cid:133)(cid:145)(cid:143)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:19)(cid:131)(cid:137)(cid:135)(cid:3)(cid:885) \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 595-4   Filed 03/05/10   Page 4 of 12\npersons who were arrested earlier on September 27, 2002 at a location on or near the northwest corner of \nVermont Avenue and K Street, N.W. (near a Citibank) and also for a group of approximately 40 persons \narrested on or near the eastern sidewalk of Connecticut Avenue between K and L Streets, N.W. \nPershing Park is located in downtown Washington, D.C. along Pennsylvania Avenue and between 14th and \n15th Streets, N.W. Two blocks to the west of Pershing Park is the White House Complex. Immediately to the \neast of Pershing Park is Freedom Plaza, an entire city block dedicated to function as an assembly and event \narea. \n4.  What is the status of the lawsuit? \nAn initial complaint in this matter was filed on November 19, 2002. On September 19, 2003, U.S. District Court \nJudge Emmet J. Sullivan certified the class for declaratory, injunctive and compensatory relief. \nOn September 24, 2004, Judge Sullivan denied defense motions to dismiss and ruled that the class claims \nagainst Chief Charles H. Ramsey and Assistant Chief Peter J. Newsham personally and in their individual \ncapacities could proceed. See Barham v. Ramsey, 338 F. Supp.2d 48 (D.D.C. 2004). Those defendants appealed \nthis ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On January 13, 2006, the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals denied Chief Ramsey and Assistant Chief Newsham’s appeals seeking reversal. See Barham \nv. Ramsey, 434 F.3d 565 (D.C. Cir. 2006). \nThroughout the case, there has been ongoing and extensive litigation including scores of depositions and \ndiscovery and motions. The plaintiffs have taken over 100 depositions of defense witnesses in this case, some \nnumber of which extended over multiple days. \nClaims against the federal government remain pending. \nThe plantiffs and the District of Columbia defendants have engaged in settlement discussions which have \nresulted in the proposed Settlement Agreement that is the subject of this notice. \n5.  Why is this a class action? \nIn a class action, one or more people called Class Representatives sue on behalf of people who have similar \nclaims. In this case, seventeen individuals representing a broad cross section of persons who were arrested, have \nserved as Class Representatives.  \nThe class representatives include: protestors who entered the park on foot; protestors who were a part of the \nUnion Station bicycle protest to draw attention to the effectiveness of non-fossil fuel based means of transport; \nnurses who were attending a professional conference in Washington, D.C. and staying at a hotel that abutted \nPershing Park, and who entered the park to see if there was a speaker to listen to; National Lawyers Guild legal \nobservers; a photo-journalist; and others who, on their way to work, entered Pershing Park and were not \nallowed to exit. \nThey have been active participants in the litigation, on behalf of the class as a whole and have been subjected to \ndiscovery, depositions and other requirements of the lawsuit that has been active since 2002. All other class \nmembers may share in the relief and recovery, if any, from the litigation without being active participants in the \nongoing proceedings and litigation. \nIn a class action, one court resolves the issues for all Class Members, except for those who voluntarily exclude \nthemselves or “opt out” from the Class.  \nU.S. District Court Judge Emmet G. Sullivan is in charge of this class action. \n \n \n \n(cid:20)(cid:151)(cid:135)(cid:149)(cid:150)(cid:139)(cid:145)(cid:144)(cid:149)(cid:491)(cid:3)(cid:6)(cid:131)(cid:142)(cid:142)(cid:3)(cid:883)(cid:486)(cid:890)(cid:889)(cid:889)(cid:486)(cid:888)(cid:889)(cid:890)(cid:486)(cid:882)(cid:889)(cid:885)(cid:888)(cid:3)(cid:150)(cid:145)(cid:142)(cid:142)(cid:3)(cid:136)(cid:148)(cid:135)(cid:135)(cid:481)(cid:3)(cid:145)(cid:148)(cid:3)(cid:152)(cid:139)(cid:149)(cid:139)(cid:150)(cid:3)(cid:153)(cid:153)(cid:153)(cid:484)(cid:19)(cid:135)(cid:148)(cid:149)(cid:138)(cid:139)(cid:144)(cid:137)(cid:19)(cid:131)(cid:148)(cid:141)(cid:22)(cid:135)(cid:150)(cid:150)(cid:142)(cid:135)(cid:143)(cid:135)(cid:144)(cid:150)(cid:484)(cid:133)(cid:145)(cid:143)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:19)(cid:131)(cid:137)(cid:135)(cid:3)(cid:886) \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 595-4   Filed 03/05/10   Page 5 of 12\nWHO IS IN THE SETTLEMENT? \nTo see if you will get money from this settlement, you first have to decide if you are a Class Member.  \n6.  How do I know if I am part of the settlement? \nJudge Sullivan decided that everyone who fits the following definition of the Class is a Class Member: All \nindividuals who were arrested in Pershing Park in the District of Columbia on September 27, 2002. \n7.  Are there exceptions to being included? \nIf you fit the description, above, you are a Class Member. \n8.  Is everyone who was arrested in connection with the Fall, 2002 protests in Washington, D.C. a Class \nMember? \nNo. Only if you fit the description, above, are you a Class Member. \nPersons who were arrested, including on September 27, 2002, at locations other than in Pershing Park are not \nClass Members. \nThere were approximately forty people who were arrested on Connecticut Avenue between K and L Streets, and \napproximately 150 persons arrested in the vicinity of Vermont Ave and K Street, N.W. The class definition does \nnot include these arrests. \n9.  I’m still not sure if I am included. \nIf you are still not sure whether you are included, you can ask for free help. You can call 1-877-678-0736 or \nvisit www.PershingParkSettlement.com for more information. \nTHE SETTLEMENT BENEFITS – WHAT YOU GET \n10. What does the settlement provide in terms of money? \nThe District of Columbia has agreed to create a $4,788,000 fund to be distributed among all Class Members \nwho send in a valid Proof of Claim, in accordance with the Settlement Agreement. \n11. How much will my payment be? \nIf it is determined that you are a Class Member, and you file a claim within the time set by the Court, you will \nbe entitled to compensation from the Claimants Funds. \nYour share of the fund will depend on the number of valid claim forms that Class Members send in, and is also \nsubject to a maximum payment of $18,000 per Class Member. Here’s how it works: \nThe fund has been set up within a framework that assumes a 75% participation rate of Class Members.  \nShould  the  participation  rate  be  equal  or  lower  than  75%  of  the  eligible  claimants  (i.e.,  266  or  fewer \nparticipating  Claimants),  each  eligible  Claimant  shall  be  allocated  and  awarded  a  pro-rata  share  of  the \nClaimants’ Funds, subject to a maximum of $18,000. Under nearly all such circumstances, this will result in a \npayment to each eligible Claimant of $18,000. \nShould the participation rate be higher than 75% of the eligible claimants (i.e., more than 266 participating \nClaimants), each eligible Claimant shall be allocated and awarded a pro-rata share of the Claimants’ Funds. This \nwill result in a payment to each of some measure less than $18,000. \nIn terms of monetary relief, the total class-wide monetary settlement is a maximum of $8,251,333. In addition \nto monies allocated for Claimants’ Funds, the settlement also provides for: $2,463,333 for Attorneys Fees and \nCosts Funds; $850,000 to be divided equally between the 17 Class Representatives who will receive more in the \nSettlement than other Class Members because of the role that they played in the litigation; and $150,000 for \n(cid:20)(cid:151)(cid:135)(cid:149)(cid:150)(cid:139)(cid:145)(cid:144)(cid:149)(cid:491)(cid:3)(cid:6)(cid:131)(cid:142)(cid:142)(cid:3)(cid:883)(cid:486)(cid:890)(cid:889)(cid:889)(cid:486)(cid:888)(cid:889)(cid:890)(cid:486)(cid:882)(cid:889)(cid:885)(cid:888)(cid:3)(cid:150)(cid:145)(cid:142)(cid:142)(cid:3)(cid:136)(cid:148)(cid:135)(cid:135)(cid:481)(cid:3)(cid:145)(cid:148)(cid:3)(cid:152)(cid:139)(cid:149)(cid:139)(cid:150)(cid:3)(cid:153)(cid:153)(cid:153)(cid:484)(cid:19)(cid:135)(cid:148)(cid:149)(cid:138)(cid:139)(cid:144)(cid:137)(cid:19)(cid:131)(cid:148)(cid:141)(cid:22)(cid:135)(cid:150)(cid:150)(cid:142)(cid:135)(cid:143)(cid:135)(cid:144)(cid:150)(cid:484)(cid:133)(cid:145)(cid:143)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:19)(cid:131)(cid:137)(cid:135)(cid:3)(cid:887) \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 595-4   Filed 03/05/10   Page 6 of 12\nNotification and Administration Funds to be used by the Class Administrator to provide notification and \ndistribution of funds to Class Members. \nIn addition to the monetary amount of $8,251,333 that is referred to as the class-wide monetary settlement, the \nsettlement agreement also allocates additional funds to be paid by the District of Columbia government to fund \ncertain equitable relief demanded by plaintiffs and agreed to by the District, described further below. \n12. What does the settlement provide in terms of my arrest record? If I participate in the settlement, will the \narrest be voided or nullified? \nEach person who participates in the Settlement Agreement will receive a Court Order that declares his or her \narrest to be “null and void” by order of the United States District Court of the District of Columbia. The Order \nauthorizes each participant to deny the occurrence of his or her arrest that day without penalty under D.C. law. \n13. If I participate in the settlement, will any existing arrest records be sealed or expunged? \nYes. For each Class Member who participates in the Settlement Agreement, the District of Columbia will \nrequest the expungement of each’s September 27, 2002 arrest records in the possession of the District of \nColumbia government or courts and in the possession of the United States Government, including the Federal \nBureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security. \n14. What steps have been taken or will be required to be taken by the Settlement Agreement to prevent a \nrecurrence or future unlawful mass arrest? \nThe attorneys at the Partnership for Civil Justice, the Class Counsel in this case, have undertaken efforts in the \nBarham class action and other cases, as well as before the Council of the District of Columbia, to secure \nmeaningful equitable relief to prevent a recurrence or future unlawful mass arrest.  \nDuring the course of this litigation as a consequence of the events of the Pershing Park mass arrest and \ncomplaints regarding other police conduct in the context of mass demonstrations, the Council of the District of \nColumbia  undertook  an  extensive  investigation  and  enacted  new  District  of  Columbia  laws  that  impose \nrestrictions on the Metropolitan Police Department in the context of mass demonstrations.  \nThe First Amendment Rights and Police Standards Act of 2004: \n(cid:120)  Establishes restrictions on the use of police lines to surround First Amendment protected assemblies; \n \n(cid:120)  Prohibits wrist-to-ankle restraints or flexcuffs in the context of certain mass demonstration arrests; \n \n(cid:120)  Affirms that it is not an offense for persons for demonstrate or parade on the sidewalks, the roadways or \nother public ways without a permit; \n \n(cid:120)  Requires police to provide an accurate written statement of options for release from police custody in the \nevent of protest-related arrests; \n \n(cid:120)  Requires the prompt processing of persons arrested in connection with a First Amendment assembly \nand, further, requires a supervisory rank officer to “document and explain” any instance where a protest-\nrelated arrestee eligible for and requesting release is not released within 4 hours from the time of arrest; \n \n(cid:120)  Establishes that the policy of the District of Columbia is to avoid issuing general orders to disperse First \nAmendment activities; \n \n(cid:120)  Requires, in the limited circumstances where dispersal of a protest may be authorized under law, that the \nMPD shall issue one or more audible orders to those assembled using an amplification system or device, \nand shall provide persons with an adequate time to disperse and with a clear and safe route for dispersal; \n \n(cid:20)(cid:151)(cid:135)(cid:149)(cid:150)(cid:139)(cid:145)(cid:144)(cid:149)(cid:491)(cid:3)(cid:6)(cid:131)(cid:142)(cid:142)(cid:3)(cid:883)(cid:486)(cid:890)(cid:889)(cid:889)(cid:486)(cid:888)(cid:889)(cid:890)(cid:486)(cid:882)(cid:889)(cid:885)(cid:888)(cid:3)(cid:150)(cid:145)(cid:142)(cid:142)(cid:3)(cid:136)(cid:148)(cid:135)(cid:135)(cid:481)(cid:3)(cid:145)(cid:148)(cid:3)(cid:152)(cid:139)(cid:149)(cid:139)(cid:150)(cid:3)(cid:153)(cid:153)(cid:153)(cid:484)(cid:19)(cid:135)(cid:148)(cid:149)(cid:138)(cid:139)(cid:144)(cid:137)(cid:19)(cid:131)(cid:148)(cid:141)(cid:22)(cid:135)(cid:150)(cid:150)(cid:142)(cid:135)(cid:143)(cid:135)(cid:144)(cid:150)(cid:484)(cid:133)(cid:145)(cid:143)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:19)(cid:131)(cid:137)(cid:135)(cid:3)(cid:888) \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 595-4   Filed 03/05/10   Page 7 of 12\n \n(cid:120)  Prohibits the deployment of officers in riot gear to First Amendment assemblies, except in limited \ncircumstances where there is a danger of violence and, further, requires the commander at the scene to \nissue a written report to the Chief which is to be made available to the public following any deployment \nof officers in riot gear; \n \n(cid:120)  Requires officers assigned to First Amendment be equipped with easily visible or “enhanced” badge or \nname identification that remains visible and allows identification even if officers are wearing riot gear; \n \n(cid:120)  Requires that the MPD promulgate regulations that pertain to the particularized First Amendment \ninterests of reporters and media when present at a First Amendment protected assembly, including \nmandating that media not be denied the access that is available to members of the general public and be \ngranted additional physical access to areas closed to the general public in order to assist their ability to \nreport on the event. See also 24 D.C.M.R. §2104 (regulations, as promulgated, which among other \nthings establish the policy of the MPD is “that media representatives shall have maximum access to First \nAmendment assemblies. . . consistent with maintaining public safety. . .”). \nIn addition, in the context of the Barham litigation, the District of Columbia entered into a written agreement \nrequiring that the Metropolitan Police Department’s Mass Demonstration Handbook shall be amended to state \nand provide written notice to officers that: \n(cid:120)  Parading without a permit, demonstrating without a permit, and participating in a First Amendment \nAssembly without a permit are not arrestable offenses; \n \n(cid:120)  New restrictions relating to the use of police lines have been imposed by the First Amendment and \nPolice  Standards  Act  of  2004,  including  specific  reference  to  the  substance  of  those  restrictions. \nAdditionally, the agreement requires such notice also be including in the standard 40 hour course given \nto new officers pertaining to “civil disturbance unit (CDU) training” and including in the standard 8 hour \nrefresher course required of all officers with CDU responsibilities. \nThe Partnership for Civil Justice Fund is class counsel also in the matter of Becker v. District of Columbia, \nCivil Action No. 01-00811, which relates to the arrest of nearly 700 persons in connection with the April, 2000 \nInternational Monetary Fund / World Bank meetings. An agreement has been recently reached in that class \naction, which if approved will mandate that: \n(cid:120)  Every MPD officer be required to take training on lawful standard operating procedures in the context of \nFirst Amendment protected assemblies and mass demonstrations; \n \n(cid:120)  Every police officer assigned to mass demonstration related responsibilities be directed to the First \nAmendment Rights and Police Standards Act of 2004; \n \n(cid:120)  The MPD make available to all persons inquiring regarding demonstration permits or related activities a \ncopy of the their rights under the First Amendment Rights and Police Standards Act of 2004, the rules \nimplementing that statute, and any forms pertaining to demonstration activities; and \n \n(cid:120)  When the MPD obtains the assistance of outside law enforcement agencies for demonstration related \nduties, that the MPD brief outside agency commanders of the District of Columbia law and standard \noperating procedures for protest activity and assign an MPD officer to each such outside agency. \n \nAlthough not strictly “equitable relief,” Class Counsel believes that the magnitude of the financial settlements in \nthe Barham and Becker mass arrest class action cases will also effect a substantial deterrent effect to prevent \nrecurrence. The two settlements, as proposed and submitted for approval, collectively impose 22 million dollars \n(cid:20)(cid:151)(cid:135)(cid:149)(cid:150)(cid:139)(cid:145)(cid:144)(cid:149)(cid:491)(cid:3)(cid:6)(cid:131)(cid:142)(cid:142)(cid:3)(cid:883)(cid:486)(cid:890)(cid:889)(cid:889)(cid:486)(cid:888)(cid:889)(cid:890)(cid:486)(cid:882)(cid:889)(cid:885)(cid:888)(cid:3)(cid:150)(cid:145)(cid:142)(cid:142)(cid:3)(cid:136)(cid:148)(cid:135)(cid:135)(cid:481)(cid:3)(cid:145)(cid:148)(cid:3)(cid:152)(cid:139)(cid:149)(cid:139)(cid:150)(cid:3)(cid:153)(cid:153)(cid:153)(cid:484)(cid:19)(cid:135)(cid:148)(cid:149)(cid:138)(cid:139)(cid:144)(cid:137)(cid:19)(cid:131)(cid:148)(cid:141)(cid:22)(cid:135)(cid:150)(cid:150)(cid:142)(cid:135)(cid:143)(cid:135)(cid:144)(cid:150)(cid:484)(cid:133)(cid:145)(cid:143)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:19)(cid:131)(cid:137)(cid:135)(cid:3)(cid:889) \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 595-4   Filed 03/05/10   Page 8 of 12\nin potential monetary payments on the District, a figure which does not include the District’s own costs for \ndefending the class action claims or for implementing the document management and indexing system that is \nrequired by the Barham settlement (as referenced immediately, below). \n \n15. What steps have been taken or will be required to be taken by the Settlement Agreement to prevent a \nrecurrence of the loss or destruction of evidence that became an issue in the Barham class action? \nAdditional requirements in the Barham settlement agreement are intended to prevent recurrence of loss or \ndestruction of evidence in protest lawsuits, which was identified and documented by Class Counsel at the \nPartnership for Civil Justice Fund and which became the focus of multiple filings, requests for sanctions and \ncourt hearings.  \nThe District has agreed, as a term and condition of the settlement of the Barham class action, if approved by the \nCourt, to: \n(cid:120)  Implement a document management system for matters arising from mass demonstrations and protests, \nencompassing the D.C. Office of the Attorney General and the MPD Office of General Counsel, that \nprovides for the indexing and logging of any documents, things, recordings or materials related to \nprotest-related complaint; \n \n(cid:120)  Require the MPD to issue general orders or policy statements to affirmatively direct that, upon notice of \nlikely  litigation,  and/or  request  to  preserve  documents  and  records  pertaining  to  alleged  police \nmisconduct involving or relating to mass demonstrations or protests, the MPD shall preserve and protect \nfrom destruction for a period of no less than three (3) years all documents, records, items, videos or \ncomputer files relating to the underlying incident; \n(cid:120)  Require that whenever a system  is activated to assist in the response to mass demonstrations or protests, \nall computer files, police communications recordings and documents reasonably related to the event be \nindexed and preserved for no less than three (3) years; \n \n(cid:120)  Require that whenever any MPD officer is assigned to (or with the capability to) engage in photographic \nor video recording of mass demonstration activities or protests that documentation shall be maintained \nreflecting the officer’s name, assignment, the equipment and recording media issued, and indexing and \nlogging the return of all media; \n \n(cid:120)  Provide any additional funds needed to pay the costs of the development and operation of the above-\nreferenced document management system for a period of three years, and may be potentially extended \nup to five years. \n \nIn addition, the District has agreed to issue a report every six months for a period of three (3) years to Class \nCounsel at the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund as to the measures taken to implement the equitable relief set \nout in the Barham class action settlement. Class Counsel will be provided an advance copy of the report and \nafforded an opportunity to comment. Each report will be transmitted to Judge Emmet G. Sullivan, will be \npublished and be public, and the comments or response of Class Counsel shall be published as an exhibit or \nattachment to each public report. \n \nThe United States District Court shall retain jurisdiction for the purpose of enforcing the requirements of the \nDocument Management and Retention Requirements for a period of three year duration. \n \n \n \n \n \n(cid:20)(cid:151)(cid:135)(cid:149)(cid:150)(cid:139)(cid:145)(cid:144)(cid:149)(cid:491)(cid:3)(cid:6)(cid:131)(cid:142)(cid:142)(cid:3)(cid:883)(cid:486)(cid:890)(cid:889)(cid:889)(cid:486)(cid:888)(cid:889)(cid:890)(cid:486)(cid:882)(cid:889)(cid:885)(cid:888)(cid:3)(cid:150)(cid:145)(cid:142)(cid:142)(cid:3)(cid:136)(cid:148)(cid:135)(cid:135)(cid:481)(cid:3)(cid:145)(cid:148)(cid:3)(cid:152)(cid:139)(cid:149)(cid:139)(cid:150)(cid:3)(cid:153)(cid:153)(cid:153)(cid:484)(cid:19)(cid:135)(cid:148)(cid:149)(cid:138)(cid:139)(cid:144)(cid:137)(cid:19)(cid:131)(cid:148)(cid:141)(cid:22)(cid:135)(cid:150)(cid:150)(cid:142)(cid:135)(cid:143)(cid:135)(cid:144)(cid:150)(cid:484)(cid:133)(cid:145)(cid:143)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:19)(cid:131)(cid:137)(cid:135)(cid:3)(cid:890) \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 595-4   Filed 03/05/10   Page 9 of 12\nHOW TO GET A PAYMENT – SUBMITTING A CLAIM FORM \n16. How can I get a payment? \nTo qualify for payment you must submit a claim form. A Proof of Claim form is attached to this Notice. You \nmay also get a claim form on the internet at www.PershingParkSettlement.com. Read the instructions carefully, \nfill out the form, include all the documents the form asks for, sign it, and mail it postmarked no later than        \nJuly 15, 2010. \nAll  claim  forms  must  be  completed  and  postmarked  or  received  no  later  than  July  15,  2010,  but  it  is \nrecommended that you complete and mail your Proof of Claim Form as soon as possible. If you do not timely \nand properly submit your Proof of Claim Form, you will not receive any money from the settlement. \n \n17. How is it determined that I am an eligible class member? \nOnly persons who timely and properly submit a Proof of Claim Form will be considered. \nThe Class Administrator shall be the determinator of the class eligibility of Claimants, consistent with the class \ndefinition approved by the Court and the application of certain guidelines. \nClaimants whose identity and arrest can be confirmed by reference to law enforcement or government records \nor documents will be deemed eligible. \nThe Class Administrator will be provided with law enforcement records, including arrest records, to facilitate \nthis determination. \nIt is optional, and not necessary, for you to submit arrest-related documents with your Proof of Claim form. The \nClass Administrator will first try to confirm your eligibility by matching your name against police arrest \nrecords. If your name cannot be matched through police arrest records, the administrator will send you a letter \nand request additional information, including that you provide copies of any arrest related documents or things. \nIf you so choose, you can facilitate this by submitting with your Proof of Claim form copies (not originals) of \nany police or court records that show you were arrested (or released, or scheduled to appear in court, etc.). \nMaterials submitted by Claimants need not strictly be denominated as an “arrest record” in order to evidence \nclass qualification. For example, any of the following would be acceptable if they evidence identity and class \nmembership: Citation Release forms, a Notice to Appear at a Court Hearing, a property receipt or bag, a “post \nand forfeit” form or record. \nIf you have misplaced or do not have records of your arrest / release, or the records are located somewhere \ninconvenient or time-consuming to retrieve, you should continue to search for your records, but do not delay \nsending in your Proof of Claim. \nAdditional procedures will be available for the Class Administrator to determine class eligibility in the absence \nof confirmation through law enforcement records. \n18. When would I get my payment? \nThe Court will hold a hearing on September 15, 2010 to decide whether to approve the settlement. If Judge \nSullivan approves the settlement after that, there may be appeals.  \nIf  the  Court  approves  the  settlement  at  that  hearing,  and  there  are  no  objections  or  appeals  that  delay \nproceeding, we anticipate that each eligible Claimant will receive his or her award in the course of two \npayments. We anticipate that the first payment will issued towards the end of 2010 and will be no less than 60% \nof your total award. The second payment will be issued within the calendar year of 2011. \nEveryone who sends in an eligible claim form will be informed of the progress of the settlement. \n(cid:20)(cid:151)(cid:135)(cid:149)(cid:150)(cid:139)(cid:145)(cid:144)(cid:149)(cid:491)(cid:3)(cid:6)(cid:131)(cid:142)(cid:142)(cid:3)(cid:883)(cid:486)(cid:890)(cid:889)(cid:889)(cid:486)(cid:888)(cid:889)(cid:890)(cid:486)(cid:882)(cid:889)(cid:885)(cid:888)(cid:3)(cid:150)(cid:145)(cid:142)(cid:142)(cid:3)(cid:136)(cid:148)(cid:135)(cid:135)(cid:481)(cid:3)(cid:145)(cid:148)(cid:3)(cid:152)(cid:139)(cid:149)(cid:139)(cid:150)(cid:3)(cid:153)(cid:153)(cid:153)(cid:484)(cid:19)(cid:135)(cid:148)(cid:149)(cid:138)(cid:139)(cid:144)(cid:137)(cid:19)(cid:131)(cid:148)(cid:141)(cid:22)(cid:135)(cid:150)(cid:150)(cid:142)(cid:135)(cid:143)(cid:135)(cid:144)(cid:150)(cid:484)(cid:133)(cid:145)(cid:143)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:19)(cid:131)(cid:137)(cid:135)(cid:3)(cid:891) \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 595-4   Filed 03/05/10   Page 10 of 12\nWe strongly recommend that you keep a copy of your Claim Form. You may want to send the form in by \ncertified mail, return receipt requested, so its receipt can be verified, but you are not required to do so. \n \n19. What am I giving up to get a payment or stay in the Class? \nUnless you exclude yourself, you are staying in the class, and that means that you can’t sue, continue to sue, or \nbe part of any lawsuit against the defendants about the legal issues in this case. It also means that all of the \nCourt’s orders will apply to you and legally bind you. \nBy effect of the proposed Settlement Agreement with the District of Columbia, in exchange for your receipt of \nmoney and other relief, you will release the District of Columbia and its MPD officers from any further claims. \nEXCLUDING YOURSELF FROM THE SETTLEMENT \nIf you don’t want a payment from this settlement, but you want to keep the right to sue or continue to sue on \nyour own and with your own attorney about the legal issues in this case, then you must take steps to get out. \nThis is called excluding yourself or “opting out” of the class. The Court will exclude from the class any member \nwho requests exclusion. \n20. How do I exclude myself from the settlement? \nTo exclude yourself from the settlement, you must send a letter by mailing stating that you want to be excluded \nfrom Barham, et al. v. Ramsey, et al. Be sure to include your name, current address, current telephone number, \nyour address at the time of the arrest (to facilitate locating you in law enforcement records) and your signature. \nYou must mail your exclusion request postmarked no later than July 15, 2010 to: \n      Barham Class Exclusions \n      c/o Gilardi & Co. LLC \n      P.O. Box 8090 \n      San Rafael, CA 949123-8090 \nIf you ask to be excluded, you will not get any settlement payment and you cannot object to the settlement. You \nwill not be legally bound by anything that happens in this lawsuit. You may be able to sue or continue to sue \ndefendants in the future for claims related to the underlying arrest. \n21. If I don’t exclude myself, can I later sue the MPD or other defendants for the same mass arrest? \nNo. Unless you exclude yourself, you give up any rights to sue the defendants for the claims that this settlement \nresolves. If you have a pending lawsuit, speak to your lawyer in that case immediately. You must exclude \nyourself from this Class to continue your own lawsuit. Remember, the exclusion deadline is July 15, 2010. \nTHE LAWYERS REPRESENTING YOU \n22. Do I have a lawyer in this case? \nThe Court has certified the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund, including attorneys Carl Messineo and Mara \nVerheyden-Hilliard to represent the Class. These lawyers are called Class Counsel. \nYou will not be charged for these lawyers. You will not be asked to pay your own personal money for the \nservices of these attorneys and their associates and staff in litigating this case and negotiating this settlement. \nOnly Class Counsel may act on behalf of the class. However, that does not prevent you from hiring your own \nlawyer to advise you personally about your rights, options or obligations as a Class Member in this lawsuit. If \nyou want to be represented by your own lawyer, you may hire one at your own expense. \n \n(cid:20)(cid:151)(cid:135)(cid:149)(cid:150)(cid:139)(cid:145)(cid:144)(cid:149)(cid:491)(cid:3)(cid:6)(cid:131)(cid:142)(cid:142)(cid:3)(cid:883)(cid:486)(cid:890)(cid:889)(cid:889)(cid:486)(cid:888)(cid:889)(cid:890)(cid:486)(cid:882)(cid:889)(cid:885)(cid:888)(cid:3)(cid:150)(cid:145)(cid:142)(cid:142)(cid:3)(cid:136)(cid:148)(cid:135)(cid:135)(cid:481)(cid:3)(cid:145)(cid:148)(cid:3)(cid:152)(cid:139)(cid:149)(cid:139)(cid:150)(cid:3)(cid:153)(cid:153)(cid:153)(cid:484)(cid:19)(cid:135)(cid:148)(cid:149)(cid:138)(cid:139)(cid:144)(cid:137)(cid:19)(cid:131)(cid:148)(cid:141)(cid:22)(cid:135)(cid:150)(cid:150)(cid:142)(cid:135)(cid:143)(cid:135)(cid:144)(cid:150)(cid:484)(cid:133)(cid:145)(cid:143)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:19)(cid:131)(cid:137)(cid:135)(cid:3)(cid:883)(cid:882) \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 595-4   Filed 03/05/10   Page 11 of 12\n23. How will the lawyers be paid? \nThe parties will ask the Court to approve payment to Class Counsel of $2,463,333 for the legal services and \ncosts associated with bringing the class action. The fees would pay Class Counsel for all services rendered, as \nwell as all costs incurred, from investigating the facts, litigating the case over the course of 7+ years, the \nconduct  of  scores  of  depositions,  extensive  briefing,  defending  against  the  appeal  of  Chief  Ramsey  and \nAssistant  Chief  Newsham,  negotiating  the  settlement,  and  services  to  be  performed  to  facilitate  the \nadministration and distribution of funds (which will be handled primarily by the Class Administrator). \nThe amount of attorneys fees and costs will not come out of your compensation of up to $18,000, nor will it \nreduce the funds available for the Class Members.  \nThe amount of attorneys fees and costs are set forth in the Settlement Agreement, and constitute a payment fund \ndistinct from Claimants’ Funds. \nOBJECTING TO THE SETTLEMENT \n24. How do I tell the Court that I object to the settlement? \nIf you are a Class Member, you can object to the settlement agreement if you don’t like any part of it. You can \nsubmit for the Court’s consideration reasons why you think the Court should not approve it. To object, you must \nsend a letter stating that you object to the proposed settlement agreement in Barham, et al. v. Ramsey, et al.    \nBe sure to include your name, address, telephone number, your signature, and the reasons why you object to the \nsettlement. \nThe attorneys for the Class and for the defendants will be allowed to file with the Court a written response to \nany submitted objections. \nIf you wish to assert any objections, you are required to submit those to three different places postmarked by no \nlater than July 15, 2010: \nTo the Court  To Class Counsel  To Defense Counsel \nClerk’s Office  Carl Messineo  Monique Pressley \nUnited States District Court  Barham Class Counsel  Assistant Attorney General \n   for the District of Columbia  Partnership for Civil Justice  Office of the Attorney General for    \n333 Constitution Ave. N.W.  617 Florida Ave. N.W.  the District of Columbia \nWashington, D.C. 20001  Washington, D.C. 20001  441 4th Street, N.W. 6th Floor South \nWashington, D.C. 20001 \n \n25. What is the difference between objecting and excluding? \nObjecting is simply telling the Court that you don’t like something about the settlement. You can object only if \nyou stay in the Class. Excluding yourself is telling the Court that you don’t want to be a part of the Class. If you \nexclude yourself, you have no basis to object because the case no longer affects you. \nTHE COURT’S FAIRNESS HEARING \nThe Court will hold a hearing to decide whether to approve the settlement. You may attend, and you may ask to \nspeak, but you don’t have to. \n26. When and where will the Court decide whether to approve the settlement? \nThe Court will hold a Fairness Hearing at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, September 15, 2010, Courtroom 24A at \nthe United States District Court for the District of Columbia, 333 Constitution Avenue, Washington, D.C. \n20001. At this hearing, the Court will consider whether the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate. If there \nare any objections, the Court will consider them. Judge Sullivan will also listen to any Class Members who ask \nto speak at the hearing. At or after the hearing, the Court will decide whether to approve the settlement. \n(cid:20)(cid:151)(cid:135)(cid:149)(cid:150)(cid:139)(cid:145)(cid:144)(cid:149)(cid:491)(cid:3)(cid:6)(cid:131)(cid:142)(cid:142)(cid:3)(cid:883)(cid:486)(cid:890)(cid:889)(cid:889)(cid:486)(cid:888)(cid:889)(cid:890)(cid:486)(cid:882)(cid:889)(cid:885)(cid:888)(cid:3)(cid:150)(cid:145)(cid:142)(cid:142)(cid:3)(cid:136)(cid:148)(cid:135)(cid:135)(cid:481)(cid:3)(cid:145)(cid:148)(cid:3)(cid:152)(cid:139)(cid:149)(cid:139)(cid:150)(cid:3)(cid:153)(cid:153)(cid:153)(cid:484)(cid:19)(cid:135)(cid:148)(cid:149)(cid:138)(cid:139)(cid:144)(cid:137)(cid:19)(cid:131)(cid:148)(cid:141)(cid:22)(cid:135)(cid:150)(cid:150)(cid:142)(cid:135)(cid:143)(cid:135)(cid:144)(cid:150)(cid:484)(cid:133)(cid:145)(cid:143)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:19)(cid:131)(cid:137)(cid:135)(cid:3)(cid:883)(cid:883) \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 595-4   Filed 03/05/10   Page 12 of 12\n27. Do I have to come to the hearing? \nNo. Class Counsel will respond to any questions that Judge Sullivan may have. But, you are welcome to come \nat your own expense. If you send an objection, you don’t have to come to the Court to talk about it. As long as \nyou mailed your written objection on time, the Court will consider it. You may also pay your own lawyer to \nattend, but it is not necessary. \n28. May I speak at the hearing? \nYou may ask the Court for permission to speak at the Fairness Hearing. To do so, you must send a letter stating \nthat it is your “Notice of Intent to Appear at Fairness Hearing in Barham, et al. v. Ramsey, et al.” Be sure to \ninclude your name, address, telephone number and your signature. The Notice of Intent to Appear must be \npostmarked no later than July 15, 2010, and be sent to the Clerk of the Court, Class Counsel and Defense \nCounsel at the three addresses set forth in question 24, above. You cannot speak at the hearing if you have \nexcluded yourself or opted out of the Class. \nIF YOU DO NOTHING \n29. What happens if I do nothing at all? \nIf you do nothing, your rights will be affected. You will be bound by the terms of the Settlement and you will be \nagreeing to a release of the claims that are contained in the Settlement Agreement. However, because you did \nnot file a claim, you will not be entitled to any money from the settlement. \nGETTING MORE INFORMATION \n30.

On September 27, 2002, demonstrations occurred in\nWashington, D.C. in connection with the World Bank [WB] and \nInternational Money Fund [IMF] meetings that took place in the\ncity.  Declaration of Richard Murphy filed in Chang v. United\nStates, Civil No. 02-0210 EGS (D.D.C.) [Chang Murphy Dec.], copy\nattached, ¶¶ 17, 36, 41.\n2.  In recent history, these meetings have been accompanied\nby demonstrations which have involved, sometimes successfully,\nefforts to disrupt the meetings and activities in the cities in\nwhich the meetings were taking place.  Chang Murphy Dec., ¶¶ 14 &\n15 & Exhs. 1 & 2; Declaration of James W. Rice, II [Rice Dec.], ¶\n3. \n3.  Before the September 27, 2002 WB/IMF meetings took\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 4 of 49\nplace, law enforcement agencies consulted with each other in\norder to address the problems caused by the disruptive\ndemonstrations in the past.  Such coordination is the standard\noperating procedure for federal law enforcement.  Declaration of\nRichard Murphy in this case [Barham Murphy Dec.], ¶ 4. \n4.  The Park Police had received information that certain\ngroups of demonstrators intended to disrupt rush hour traffic in\nWashington, D.C. and to “quarantine” the World Bank/IMF complex\nin order to disrupt the meetings occurring therein.  Chang Murphy\nDec., ¶¶ 17, 36 & Exh. 3.  The FBI was aware of the possibility\nof a terrorist attack or other violence.  Rice Dec., ¶ 3.\n5.  The National Park Service annually hosts more than 3,000\ndemonstrations and special events and regularly engages in\nadvance public safety planning with other federal and local law\nenforcement agencies as part of its routine procedures.   Barham\nMurphy Dec., ¶ 4. \n6.  Pursuant to Presidential Decision Directive 39 [PDD-39],\nsigned June 21, 1995, the FBI is the lead federal agency\nresponsible for addressing threats or acts of terrorism in this\ncountry.  See 28 C.F.R. § 0.85a(k)(1).  \n7.  In May 1998, PDD-62 designated the FBI as the lead\nfederal agency for crisis management in connection with a Weapon\nof Mass Destruction [WMD] incident.  Rice Dec., ¶ 4.\n8.  With respect to the September 27, 2002 demonstrations,\n2\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 5 of 49\nthe FBI's role was: (1) to prevent, respond and investigate any\nterrorist-related incidents that affected the WB/IMF meeting or\nparticipants; (2) to investigate any crimes that occurred against\nfederal property or assaults upon foreign officials (such as\nWB/IMF attendees) or federal employees; (3) to gather\nintelligence related to the event; and (4) to provide liaison and\nassistance, as requested, to local law enforcement and fire-\nrescue personnel.   Rice Dec., ¶ 4.\n9.  Prior to the September 27th demonstrations, law\nenforcement agencies including the FBI and the Park Police\nparticipated in meetings to discuss how to respond to possible\nscenarios that could arise during the demonstrations, including\nthe possibility of assaults, vandalism, rioting, or terrorist\nattacks.  Rice Dec., ¶ 5.  \n10.  During these meetings, there was no discussion\nregarding making illegal arrests of demonstrators, or taking any\naction to improperly disrupt the demonstrators’ lawful\nactivities.  Rice Dec., ¶ 6; Barham Murphy Dec., ¶ 6.\n11.  The Park Police primarily focused its efforts on\nprotecting federal parkland but it was also ready to provide\nassistance to the Metropolitan Police Department [MPD].

The Park Police occasionally assists MPD and other\nfederal law enforcement agencies in the District of Columbia.  \n3\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 6 of 49\nId. at ¶¶ 11, 21.  In such situations, backup officers depend on\nthe requesting officer’s full knowledge of the situation and\nexpect that the requesting officer is justified in undertaking\nsuch arrests and searches that may occur.  Id.  \n13.  Cooperation and coordination between police agencies is\noften critical because police resources are stretched to cover\nvarious responsibilities throughout the city.  Id.\n14.  A decision to make an arrest rests on the arresting\npolice agency.  Chang Murphy Dec., ¶ 21. \n15.  The FBI’s role consisted of various tasks, including\nintelligence gathering, monitoring crowd movement and\nsurveillance for possible terrorist or criminal activity, and at\nthe request of MPD, providing portable fingerprint processing\nequipment and FBI employees to operate that equipment.

The Park Police was informed by high-ranking MPD\nofficials that demonstrators in Pershing Park had caused property\ndamage in one commercial area, and MPD intended to prevent them\nfrom traveling to another commercial area where they might be\n4\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 7 of 49\nexpected to cause additional property damage.  Chang Murphy Dec.,\n¶ 42; Barham Dec., ¶ 7.  \n19.  Based on this MPD request for assistance, the Park\nPolice formed a partial and limited static police line on the\nnorth and south sides of Pershing Park.  Chang Murphy Dec., ¶ 43.\n20.  Neither the Park Police nor the FBI made any arrests of\ndemonstrators, with the exception of one arrest by Park Police in\na different area.  Chang Murphy Dec., ¶ 53 & Exh. 8; Rice Dec., ¶\n8.\n21.  MPD decided to make mass arrests after MPD officers\nmoved the demonstrators within Pershing Park into a smaller area\nwithin the Park, and this decision was reached without consulting\nthe Park Police or the FBI.  Chang Murphy Dec. at ¶¶ 45-48;\nBarham Murphy Dec., ¶ 8.  \n22.  Demonstrators were seized and flex-cuffed by MPD\nofficers and then taken by MPD to MPD-controlled buses.  During\nthis time the only involvement by the Park Police was to maintain\nits limited partial static line.  Chang Murphy Dec., ¶¶ 48-50.\n23.  The FBI had no direct contact with any arrestee.  Rice\nDec., ¶ 8. \n24.  The arrested individuals were fingerprinted by MPD\npersonnel, who forwarded the fingerprint cards to FBI personnel,\nwho then scanned the fingerprint cards into the FBI's Integrated\nAutomated Fingerprint Identification System [IAFIS], in order to\n5\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 8 of 49\nverify the identities of the arrestees.

Adding plaintiffs’ fingerprints to the IAFIS database\nis no different than what occurs any time an individual is\narrested and fingerprinted by local law enforcement authorities\nwho then routinely submit the fingerprint cards to the FBI.  \nRice Dec., ¶¶ 10, 14.\n                                         \nROSCOE C.

Plaintiffs allege that these arrests\ndemonstrate a conspiracy on the part of federal and local law\nenforcement to disrupt free speech and criminalize dissent.\nPlaintiffs seek injunctive relief as well as damages for the\n     2  Plaintiffs also seek to certify a class of the\nindividuals arrested on September 27, 2002.  Federal defendants\nopposed plaintiffs’ motion for class certification on March 28,\n2003.  See Docket Entry # 20.\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 10 of 49\nviolations they allege.\nPlaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint, as it pertains to the\nfederal defendants, must be dismissed.   As is evident from the\nlack of specific factual allegations in the First Amended\nComplaint as to actions taken by federal law enforcement\nofficials or agencies, plaintiffs have failed to state a claim\nagainst the federal defendants.  The reason for this is simple. \nThe conduct about which plaintiffs complain, to the extent it in\nfact occurred, was conducted by the District of Columbia’s\nMetropolitan Police Department [MPD], and not by any federal\nagencies or employees.  \nThe accompanying declarations of James W. Rice, II, for the\nFBI [Rice Dec.], and the two declarations of Richard Murphy, for\nthe United States Park Police, show that any action taken by\nfederal law enforcement during the course of the arrests of\nplaintiffs was minimal and peripheral.  No federal law\nenforcement officers or officials “rounded-up” plaintiffs,\narrested any of them, transported them to any detention facility,\nor detained them there.  Rather, the Park Police only responded\nto an MPD request to help form part of a police line at Pershing\nPark for a limited period of time, and the FBI used its portable\nfingerprint processing equipment to scan fingerprint cards\nprovided by MPD into the FBI’s fingerprint system, in order to\nverify the identities of the arrestees.  Such actions, clearly\n2\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 11 of 49\nlimited in nature, caused no legally cognizable injury to\nplaintiffs.  Moreover, these actions are in fact the legal\nfunctions with which these federal agencies are charged.\nAccordingly, for the reasons set forth below, the First\nAmendment Complaint should be dismissed as it pertains to the\nfederal defendants.\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\nA.  Events Leading Up to September 27, 2002\nThis case arises out of a weekend of protests relating to\nthe World Bank and the International Money Fund [IMF] meetings\nthat took place in September 2002.  In recent history, these\nmeetings have been accompanied by demonstrations which have\ninvolved, sometimes successfully, efforts to disrupt the meetings\nand activities in the cities in which the meetings were taking\nplace.\nThe accompanying Declaration of Richard Murphy filed in\nChang v. United States, Civil No. 02-0210 EGS (D.D.C.) [Chang\nMurphy Dec.],3 a case also involving arrests made during the\nSeptember 27, 2002 demonstrations here in Washington, D.C.,\nprovides relevant background information leading up to these\narrests and details the Park Police’s involvement in the events\n     3 Major Murphy is with the United States Park Police and at\nthe time relevant to this case was a Captain formally assigned to\nthe Park Police Special Forces Branch responsible for crowd\ncontrol at major demonstrations on federal parkland in the\nNational Capitol Region.  Chang Murphy Dec., ¶ 3.\n3\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 12 of 49\noccurring on that day.  The Chang Murphy Declaration has been\nsupplemented by another declaration from Major Murphy in this\ncase [Barham Murphy Dec.], which provides greater detail as to\nthe planning that went into law enforcement’s efforts to prepare\nfor these demonstrations.  Finally, the Declaration of James W.\nRice, II [Rice Dec.], a Supervisory Special Agent in the FBI’s\nWashington Field Office, explains the FBI’s limited role in\nconnection with processing the fingerprint cards of plaintiffs\nafter they had been arrested and fingerprinted by MPD, and the\nFBI’s legal obligation to serve as the lead federal agency with\nrespect to terrorist acts within the United States, and the\nactivities associated with those responsibilities.  Rice Dec., ¶\n4.\nAs the Chang and Barham Murphy Declarations and the Rice\nDeclaration explain, law enforcement planning for the September\n2002 demonstrations did not occur in a vacuum.  Rather, law\nenforcement officials were mindful of the 1999 protests during\nthe World Trade Organization meetings in Seattle, which\nsubstantially disrupted activities in that city and resulted in\nsignificant property damage and numerous arrests.  Chang Murphy\nDec., ¶ 14 & Exh. 1; Rice Dec., ¶ 3.  Again in April 2000, World\nBank-IMF meetings here in Washington, D.C. were disrupted by\nprotesters.  Hundreds of people were arrested after attempting to\nbreach an MPD police line protecting the World Bank-IMF\n4\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 13 of 49\nbuildings.  Chang Murphy Dec., ¶ 15 & Exh. 2; Rice Dec., ¶ 3.\nSubsequent international demonstrations of a similar vein\nresulted in the use of deadly force by law enforcement officers\nto protect themselves against attacking rioters.  Rice Dec., ¶ 3.\nConsequently, law enforcement agencies consulted with each\nother prior to the demonstrations planned for September 2002, in\norder to address the problems caused by the disruptive\ndemonstrations in the past.  Such coordination is the standard\noperating procedure for federal law enforcement.  Barham Murphy\nDec., ¶ 4.  The World Bank/IMF meetings scheduled for that period\ninvolved a gathering of more than 8,000 national and\ninternational dignitaries, and the World Bank/IMF buildings where\nthe meetings were to occur were designated foreign missions for\nthat period.  The Park Police had received information that\ncertain groups of demonstrators intended to disrupt rush hour\ntraffic in Washington, D.C. and to “quarantine” the World\nBank/IMF complex in order to disrupt the meetings occurring\ntherein.  Chang Murphy Dec., ¶¶ 17, 36 & Exh. 3.  The FBI was\naware of the possibility of a terrorist attack or other violence,\nespecially because these meetings were scheduled approximately\none year after the September 11, 2001 deadly terrorist attacks. \nRice Dec., ¶ 3.\nConsistent with its charge as the agency responsible for\nfederal parkland in Washington, D.C., the National Park Service\n5\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 14 of 49\n[NPS] engaged in extensive planning.  The NPS annually hosts more\nthan 3,000 demonstrations and special events and regularly\nengages in advance public safety planning with other federal and\nlocal law enforcement agencies as part of its routine procedures. \nExamples of this in past years include the planning that occurred\nbefore the annual Fourth of July Celebrations and the March for\nLife demonstrations, the 1999 NATO 50th Anniversary Summit, the\n1997 Promise Keepers demonstration, the 1995 Million Man March,\nand the 1993 Holocaust Memorial Museum.  Barham Murphy Dec., ¶ 4. \nThe FBI was also involved in these coordination efforts. \nPursuant to Presidential Decision Directive 39 [PDD-39], signed\nJune 21, 1995, the FBI is the lead federal agency responsible for\naddressing threats or acts of terrorism in this country.  See 28\nC.F.R. § 0.85a(k)(1).  In May 1998, PDD-62 designated the FBI as\nthe lead federal agency for crisis management in connection with\na Weapon of Mass Destruction [WMD] incident.  With respect to the\nSeptember 27, 2002 demonstrations, the FBI's role was: (1) to\nprevent, respond and investigate any terrorist-related incidents\nthat affected the WB/IMF meeting or participants; (2) to\ninvestigate any crimes that occurred against federal property or\nassaults upon foreign officials (such as WB/IMF attendees) or\nfederal employees; (3) to gather intelligence related to the\nevent; and (4) to provide liaison and assistance, as requested,\nto local law enforcement and fire-rescue personnel.   Rice Dec., ¶\n6\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 15 of 49\n4.\nPrior to the September 27th demonstrations, law enforcement\nagencies including the FBI, the Park Police, the United States\nMarshal’s Service, and the United States Capitol Police\nparticipated in meetings to discuss how to respond to possible\nscenarios that could arise during the demonstrations, including\nthe possibility of assaults, vandalism, rioting, or terrorist\nattacks.  Rice Dec., ¶ 5.  During these meetings, there was no\ndiscussion regarding making illegal arrests of demonstrators, or\ntaking any action to improperly disrupt the demonstrators’ lawful\nactivities.  Rice Dec., ¶ 6; Barham Murphy Dec., ¶ 6.\nRecognizing that demonstrators may properly engage in\nconduct that does not violate the law, the Park Police identified\nits objectives to include maintaining security around the White\nHouse complex, protecting citizens and visitors, assuring the\nsafety of Park Police personnel, safeguarding the Park Service’s\nmonuments and memorials, and assuring that the World Bank-IMF\nmeetings occurred without disruption.  Chang Murphy Dec., ¶ 18;\nBarham Murphy Dec., ¶ 6.\nThe Park Police primarily focused its efforts on protecting\nfederal parkland but it was also ready to provide assistance to\nthe Metropolitan Police Department.  Chang Murphy Dec., ¶ 19. \nThe Park Police occasionally assists MPD and other federal law\nenforcement agencies in the District of Columbia.   Id. at ¶¶ 11,\n7\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 16 of 49\n21.  For example, to help address with increasing criminal\nactivities, in 1994 the Park Police helped patrol the Fifth\nDistrict of the Metropolitan Police Department.  Id.  Park Police\nassistance, however, is traditionally done on a case-by-case\nbasis that follows a request for assistance, and after the Park\nPolice determines whether it has sufficiently available police\nresources.  Id.\nIf the Park Police has sufficiently available police\nresources, it will also provide backup assistance to other police\nagencies.  Id. at ¶ 12.  Such backup assistance cover a wide\nrange of activities and situations, from ensuring that a\nrequesting officer is not attacked while conducting an arrest or\nsearch, closing city streets following motor vehicle accidents,\nproviding police lines, preserving crime and accident scenes, to\nchasing suspects identified by the requesting officer.  Chang\nMurphy Dec., ¶ 12.  In such situations, backup officers depend on\nthe requesting officer’s full knowledge of the situation and\nexpect that the requesting officer is justified in undertaking\nsuch arrests and searches that may occur.  Id.  See also Rice\nDec., ¶ 13 (FBI did not question the basis for any arrests).\nCooperation and coordination between police agencies is often\ncritical, because police resources are stretched to cover various\nsecurity areas, a large range of potential targets located\nthroughout the metropolitan area, as well as to perform essential\n8\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 17 of 49\npolice services in the rest of the city and Federal parkland. \nId. \nA decision to make an arrest, however, always rests on the\narresting police agency.  Chang Murphy Dec., ¶ 21.  When back-up\nassistance is requested, the Park Police do not normally “second-\nguess” the requesting officer if the request for assistance\nappears reasonable.  Barham Dec., ¶ 7.\nThe FBI’s role consisted of various tasks.  Some FBI\npersonnel were assigned to the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force\nto engage in intelligence gathering.  At the request of MPD,\nadditional FBI personnel were assigned to work directly with MPD\nintelligence teams and were supervised by MPD personnel.  The\nduties of these FBI personnel included monitoring crowd movement\nand surveillance for possible terrorist or criminal activity.  At\nthe request of MPD, and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 533, the FBI also\nprovided portable fingerprint processing equipment and\napproximately ten support employees from the FBI’s Criminal\nJustice Information System [CJIS] Division to operate that\nequipment, in order to assist MPD with prisoner identification. \nRice Dec., ¶¶ 7-9.\nB.  September 27, 2002\nOn September 27, 2002, a large group of demonstrators\ngathered in Pershing Park.  Chang Murphy Dec., ¶ 41.  MPD police\nofficers formed a police line on the west side of Pershing Park,\n9\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 18 of 49\nand requested back-up assistance from the Park Police.  Id. at ¶\n13.\nMajor Murphy was informed by high-ranking MPD officials that\ndemonstrators in Pershing Park had caused property damage in one\ncommercial area, and MPD intended to prevent them from traveling\nto another commercial area where they might be expected to cause\nadditional property damage.  Chang Murphy Dec., ¶ 42; Barham\nDec., ¶ 7.  Based on this MPD request for assistance, and the\nrapidly evolving situation, Major Murphy directed the Park Police\nto form a partial and limited static police line on the north and\nsouth sides of Pershing Park.  Chang Murphy Dec., ¶ 43.\nMPD then asked Major Murphy if the demonstrators could be\narrested for demonstrating on federal parkland without a permit. \nMajor Murphy responded that, although no group had been given a\npermit to demonstrate in the park, the Park Police would make no\narrests without first warning the demonstrators that they were in\nviolation of Park Police regulations and then allowing them the\nopportunity to comply with those regulations.  Chang Murphy Dec.,\n¶ 44.  The Park Police were not asked by MPD to issue any such\nwarnings, nor did they do so.  \nThe Park Police, significantly, made no arrests.  Rather,\nMPD decided to make mass arrests after MPD officers moved the\ndemonstrators within Pershing Park into a smaller area within the\nPark, and this decision was reached without consulting the Park\n10\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 19 of 49\nService or the Park Police.  Id. at ¶¶ 45-48.  The decision to\narrest the demonstrators was made without any consultation by MPD\nwith the Park Police.  Barham Murphy Dec., ¶ 8.  Demonstrators\nwere seized and flex-cuffed by MPD officers and then taken by MPD\nto MPD-controlled buses.  During this time the only involvement\nby the Park Police was to maintain its limited partial static\nline.  Chang Murphy Dec., ¶¶ 48-50; Barham Murphy Dec., ¶¶ 7-8.\nThe Park Police did arrest one person who is not a named\nplaintiff in this case.  This individual was warned three times\nby the Park Police and chose to ignore those warnings and attempt\nto cross a Park Police line located on the south side curb of\nPennsylvania Avenue and 15th Street.  Chang Murphy Dec., ¶ 53 &\nExh. 8.  Other than this one arrest, the remaining arrests –-\nwhich are the subject of this litigation -- were carried out\nentirely by MPD.  Furthermore, “[n]either the National Park\nService nor the Park Police were involved in the transport,\nconfinement, processing or release of any of the persons who MPD\narrested.”  Chang Murphy Dec., ¶ 16.\nThe FBI did not participate in crowd control or participate\nin any of the arrests of the demonstrators.  The FBI also had no\nrole in the transportation of the demonstrators arrested to the\nD.C. Police Academy.  Rice Dec., ¶¶ 8, 10.  Indeed, FBI personnel\nhad no direct contact with any arrestee.  Rather, upon their\narrival, the arrested individuals were fingerprinted by MPD\n11\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 20 of 49\npersonnel, who forwarded the fingerprint cards to FBI CJIS\npersonnel stationed in the Academy gymnasium.  FBI CJIS personnel\nthen scanned the fingerprint cards into the FBI's Integrated\nAutomated Fingerprint Identification System [IAFIS], in order to\nverify the identities of the arrestees.  Rice Dec., ¶ 9.  Adding\nplaintiffs’ fingerprints to the IAFIS database is no different\nthan what occurs any time an individual is arrested and\nfingerprinted by local law enforcement authorities who then\nroutinely submit the fingerprint cards to the FBI.  Thus, the FBI\nplayed no role in the post-arrest processing of WB/IMF\ndemonstrators other than operating the fingerprint card scanning\nequipment.  Rice Dec., ¶¶ 10, 14.\nThe FBI also was involved in intelligence-gathering, as part\nof its responsibilities to prevent or effectively respond to any\nterrorist or other criminal activities.  These intelligence-\ngathering activities, however, were limited to direct observation\nof crowd activity on September 27, 2002, looking for any\nterrorist or other criminal activity.  Rice Dec., ¶ 12.\n  Because federal defendants were not involved in any alleged\nviolations of the demonstrators rights, did not coordinate or\nconspire to violate plaintiffs’ rights, and did not participate\nin MPD’s decision to arrest plaintiffs or in the actual arrests\nthemselves, the federal defendants should be dismissed from this\nlawsuit.  \n12\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 21 of 49\nARGUMENT\nI. Plaintiffs’ Constitutional Claims Against The\nFederal Defendants Must Be Dismissed.        \nIn Counts I, II and III of the Complaint, plaintiffs allege\nthat defendants violated their constitutional rights under the\nFirst, Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, by disrupting their\nFirst Amendment activities and subjecting them to false arrest\nand false imprisonment.  Plaintiffs also argue that defendants’\nactions in processing and treating them differently than others\narrested for minor offenses violates their rights to due process\nand equal protection under the law.  Finally, plaintiffs seek to\npursue their constitutional claims against the unidentified\nindividual federal defendants under Bivens v. Six Unknown Federal\nNarcotics Agents, 403 U.S. 388 (1971) [Bivens].  Complaint, at p.\n44.\nA.   The Constitutional Claims Against Unidentified\nIndividual Federal Defendants Must Be Dismissed.   \nThe Complaint lists as defendants “Unidentified Officers\n[and] Supervisors” and claims that this includes individuals who\n“engaged in joint action with the named defendants to deprive\nplaintiffs of their clearly established constitutional rights.” \nComplaint, ¶ 49.  The Complaint further states that these\nunidentified individuals “engaged in the mass arrests and\npolitical roundups” without probable cause or lawful\njustification.  Id.\n13\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 22 of 49\nSuch allegations do not, and cannot state a claim against\nany unnamed individual federal defendants.  There is no authority\nfor joining fictitious unidentified defendants, and thus they\nshould be dismissed.  See, e.g., Armstrong v. United States\nBureau of Prisons, 976 F. Supp. 17, 23 (D.D.C. 1997).  \nMoreover, it is well-settled that individual service is\nrequired in Bivens action.  See Simpkins v. District of Columbia\nGovernment, 108 F.3d 366, 369 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (defendant federal\nofficer in Bivens suit must be served as an individual, pursuant\nto Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(e)); James v. United States, 709 F. Supp.\n257 (D.D.C. 1989)(same).  Accordingly, unless an individual\nfederal employee voluntarily makes an appearance or otherwise\nwaives any personal jurisdiction defense, plaintiffs must begin\nthe process of acquiring personal jurisdiction with proper\nservice of process.  The docket in this case indicates no\ncompliance with these service requirements.\nEqually important, with respect to federal employees sued in\ntheir individual capacities, the defense of qualified immunity\nmay be then asserted as an affirmative defense.  Wilson v. Layne,\n523 U.S. 603, 609 (1999); Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818\n(1982).  Such a defense obviously cannot be raised, however,\nunless the identity of the individual defendant is known and the\nactions such a defendant purportedly took alleged.\nPlaintiffs are not entitled to use this litigation as a\n14\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 23 of 49\nfishing expedition to see if they can find some individual\nfederal defendant who may have violated their rights.  See Laird\nv. Tatum, 408 U.S. 1, 14 (1972) (“Stripped to its essentials,\nwhat respondents appear to be seeking is a broad-scale\ninvestigation, conducted by themselves as private parties armed\nwith the subpoena power of a federal district court . . . .”);\nEllsberg v. Mitchell, 807 F.2d 204, 207-208 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (“We\ndecline to license any plaintiff to embark on a fishing\nexpedition in government waters on the basis of such\nspeculation.”); Dickson v. United States, 831 F. Supp. 893, 900\n(D.D.C. 1993) (court rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the CIA’s\ntradition of secrecy and bad faith warranted fishing expedition\nwhere plaintiffs’ allegations were factually vague and legally\nnon-specific).   This is especially true in light of the\naccompanying Murphy and Rice declarations, demonstrating that\nfederal law enforcement agencies had minimal involvement in the\nevents covered by the Complaint and the involvement they did have\ndid not violate any of plaintiffs’ rights.  See infra at 20-28.\nAccordingly, to the extent the Complaint can be read to\nraise Bivens claims against unidentified federal employees, such\nclaims should be dismissed.\nB.  The Constitutional Claims Against the Federal\nOrganizations and Against the Individual\nDefendants in Their Official Capacities Must\nBe Dismissed On Sovereign Immunity Grounds.  \nTo the extent that plaintiffs may be seeking damages against\n15\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 24 of 49\nany federal law enforcement agencies, and the individual federal\ndefendants in their official capacities, plaintiffs’ claims must\nbe dismissed because there has been no waiver of sovereign\nimmunity for such claims.  Sovereign immunity bars all suits\nagainst the United States except in accordance with the explicit\nterms of the statutory waiver of such immunity.  Lane v. Pena,\n518 U.S. 187, 190-91 (1996); Cox v. Secretary of Labor, 739 F.\nSupp. 29, 30 (D.D.C. 1990); see also, United States v. Testan,\n424 U.S. 392, 399 (1976); United States v. Mitchell, 445 U.S.\n535, 538 (1980); Kline v. Republic of El Salvador, 603 F. Supp.\n1313, 1316 (D.D.C. 1985).  That plaintiff may have named federal\nemployees as defendants in their official capacities does not\noperate to evade the immunity of the sovereign.  See Clark v.\nLibrary of Congress, 750 F.2d 89, 103-104 (D.C. Cir. 1984)\n(sovereign immunity acts as a bar to a damages remedy against the\nLibrarian of Congress in an official capacity).  \nThe Federal Tort Claims Act [FTCA] does not waive the\nfederal government's immunity from suit for any constitutional\ntorts that may be committed by its employees.  28 U.S.C. §§\n2679(b)(1) and (b)(2); Kline v. Republic of El Salvador, 603 F.\nSupp. at 1317; see also  Laswell v. Brown, 683 F.2d 261 (8th Cir.\n1982); Birnbaum v. United States, 588 F.2d 319, 327-328 (2nd Cir.\n1978).  Nor does the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §\n701, et seq., act as a waiver of sovereign immunity in suits\n16\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 25 of 49\nseeking money damages against the government.  Scanwell\nLaboratories, Inc. v. Thomas, 521 F.2d 941, 948 (D.C. Cir. 1975),\ncert. denied, 425 U.S. 910 (1976); Cook County Legal Assistance\nFoundation v. Pauken, 573 F. Supp. 231, 234 (N.D. Ill. 1983). \nAdditionally, to the extent that plaintiffs’ First Amended\nComplaint can be read to seek monetary relief in tort against an\nagency of the United States, it is clear that the only possible\nbasis for jurisdiction in this Court would be under the FTCA. \nSee Kline v. Republic of El Salvador, 603 F. Supp. at 1316.\nConsequently, any damages claims for constitutional torts\nraised against federal agencies or employees in their official\ncapacities must be dismissed.\nC.   Plaintiffs’ Claims for Injunctive Relief Against \nThe Federal Defendants Fail for Lack of Standing.\nIn Steel Co., aka Chicago Steel & Pickling Co. v. Citizens\nfor a Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83 (1998), the Supreme Court\nreiterated the well established three requirements to meet the\nirreducible constitutional minimum of standing: (1) there must be\nan alleged injury in fact, (2) there must be a causation\nconnection between the plaintiff’s injury and the complained of\nconduct of the defendant, and (3) there must be redressability or\na likelihood that the requested relief will redress the alleged\ninjury.  The Court stated that the party invoking federal\njurisdiction bears the burden of establishing its existence.  Id.\nat 88. \n17\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 26 of 49\nHere plaintiffs’ claims against the federal defendants fail\nfor lack of causation.  Plaintiffs allege that they were the\nvictims of false arrest and imprisonment and their First\nAmendment rights were violated when their demonstration\nactivities were halted by the arrests.  The Murphy and Rice\ndeclarations, however, make clear that federal law enforcement\nofficers had no involvement in these actions.  The decision to\nstop plaintiffs from further engaging in First Amendment\nactivities was entirely made by MPD, not by the Park Police\npresent on the scene.  Chang Murphy Dec., ¶ 47; Barham Murphy\nDec., ¶ 3.  Similarly the FBI had no involvement in this\ndecision.  Rice Dec., ¶¶ 10, 13.  Further, the actual arrests\nwere carried out by MPD alone.  Neither the Park Police nor the\nFBI were involved in the decision to make the arrests or the\nactual arrests themselves.  Chang Murphy Dec., ¶ 47; Barham\nMurphy Dec., ¶ 3; Rice Dec., ¶ 8.  The transportation to a\ndetention facility, and the detention there, was also carried out\nsolely by MPD officers.  Chang Murphy Dec., ¶ 50; Rice Dec., ¶\n10. \nThe only action taken by the Park Police in connection with\nplaintiffs was to provide back-up assistance in the form of a\npartial static line near the demonstrators.  Plaintiffs do not\nallege that the partial static line provided by the Park Police\nprevented them from being able to leave the area of the\n18\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 27 of 49\ndemonstrations.  Thus, to the extent that plaintiffs allege that\nthey were harmed when they could not voluntarily disperse, or\nwhen they were arrested and transported to a detention facility,\nno action by federal defendants caused these injuries.\nAs to plaintiffs’ claims regarding having their fingerprints\ntaken, the only action taken by the FBI was to process\nfingerprints through the IAFIS after MPD had gathered the\nfingerprints from the demonstrators who were arrested.  Rice\nDec., ¶¶ 10-14.  Thus, plaintiffs’ claims that they were harmed\nby allegedly illegal fingerprinting was not a harm caused by the\nFBI. \nPlaintiffs’ claims regarding any surveillance engaged in by\nthe FBI fails to establish standing because it resulted in no\nconcrete harm to the plaintiffs.  The Supreme Court has held that\n“[m]ere surveillance by government authorities” does not support\na claim that a person’s First Amendment rights have been\nviolated.  Laird v. Tatum, 408 U.S. 1, 15-16 (1972).  See\nAnderson v. Davila, 125 F.3d 148, 160 (3d Cir. 1997)\n(“surveillance of individuals in public places does not, by\nitself, implicate the Constitution”); Mason v. Ward, 1991 WL\n143713, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. July 20, 1991) (“Mere surveillance\nconducted by government authorities does not give rise to an\naction for violation of rights guaranteed under the First\nAmendment.”).  \n19\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 28 of 49\nIn Laird, the Supreme Court rejected a claim that Army\nsurveillance violated the plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights. \nThe Court held that no cognizable injury could be based on\n“merely [] an individual’s knowledge that a government agency was\nengaged in certain activities or from an individual’s concomitant\nfear that, armed with the fruits of those activities, the agency\nmight take some other and additional action detrimental to the\nclass.  Laird, 408 U.S. at 11.  Thus, the mere existence of\ngovernment investigative and intelligence-gathering is\ninsufficient to establish standing.  Mason, 1991 WL 143713 at *6.\nFinally, plaintiffs allege that they were harmed by a\nconspiracy between law enforcement agencies to disrupt their\nright to free speech and to engage in illegal mass arrests.  The\nMurphy and Rice declarations, however, make clear that federal\nlaw enforcement agencies had no involvement in any such\nconspiracy.  Barham Murphy Dec., ¶ 6; Rice Dec., ¶ 13; see infra\nat 30-37.  Thus, even if plaintiffs could show that some kind of\nconspiracy exists and they were harmed by it, they cannot make\nthe causal link to federal defendants.\nAccordingly, plaintiffs’ claims against the federal\ndefendants should be dismissed for lack of standing.\nII.  Federal Defendants Violated No Legal \nRights of Plaintiffs in Providing Back-up\nAssistance To Local Law Enforcement.               \nThe Murphy and Rice declarations set forth the limited\n20\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 29 of 49\nparticipation by the Park Police and the FBI in the events that\noccurred on September 27, 2002, which plaintiffs alleged caused\nthem harm.  Significantly, both the Park Police and the FBI acted\nat the request of MPD and, as demonstrated below, performed\nfunctions that are standard and entirely lawful.  \nA.  Actions by the Park Police.\nThe Park Police’s only involvement in action affecting\nplaintiffs was to form a limited police line around parts of\nPershing Park after high level officials from MPD informed them\nthat some members of the demonstrators had engaged in property\ndamage in a commercial area.  Chang Murphy Dec., ¶¶ 43, 49;\nBarham Murphy Dec., ¶ 7.  The Park Police, therefore, reasonably\nbelieved that their back-up assistance was needed to prevent\ndemonstrators from leaving the area and going to another area\nwhere property damage might occur.  See Chang Murphy Dec., ¶ 42.\nThe Park Police relied in good faith on the apparently\nreasonable request of another law enforcement organization in\nforming the police line around two sides of Pershing Park.\nNumerous cases stand for the proposition that such reliance is\nproper.\nIn Whiteley v. Warden, 401 U.S. 560 (1971), a county sheriff\nobtained an arrest warrant for a person suspected of a crime and\nsent a message statewide over the radio describing the suspect. \nIn reliance on the radio message, police in another county\n21\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 30 of 49\nstopped the suspect and searched his car.  The arrest was\nultimately determined to be invalid, due to lack of probable\ncause.  The Supreme Court, however, stated:\nWe do not, of course, question that Laramie police were\nentitled to act on the strength of the radio bulletin. \nCertainly police officers called upon to aid other officers\nin executing arrest warrants are entitled to assume that the\nofficers requesting aid offered the magistrate the\ninformation requisite to support an independent judicial\nassessment of probable cause.\nId. at 230.\nIn United States v. Hensley, 469 U.S. 221 (1985), police\nofficers stopped a car in reliance on another police department’s\n“wanted flyer,” which had been issued for armed robbery suspects. \nThe Supreme Court held that:\n[W]hen evidence is uncovered during a search incident to an\narrest in reliance merely on a flyer or bulletin, its\nadmissibility turns on whether the officers who issued the\nflyer possessed probable cause to make the arrest.  It does\nnot turn on whether those relying on the flyer were\nthemselves aware of the specific facts which led their\ncolleagues to seek their assistance.  In an era when\ncriminal suspects are increasingly mobile and likely to flee\nacross jurisdictional boundaries, this rule is a matter of\ncommon sense: it minimizes the volume of information\nconcerning suspects that must be transmitted to other\njurisdiction and enables police in one jurisdiction to act\npromptly in reliance on information from another\njurisdiction.\nId., 469 U.S. at 231.\nThe Ninth Circuit applied the Whitley decision in United\nStates v. Robinson, 536 F.2d 1298, 1300 (9th Cir. 1976), to hold\nthat although an officer who issues a wanted bulletin must have\nlegally sufficient probable cause , the officer who acts in\n22\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 31 of 49\nreliance on the bulletin need not have personal knowledge of the\nevidence supporting the probable cause determination.  In\nreaching this conclusion, the Ninth Circuit stated that:\neffective law enforcement cannot be conducted unless police\nofficers can act on directions and information transmitted\nby one officer to another and that officers, who must act\nswiftly, cannot be expected to cross-examine their fellow\nofficers about the foundation for the transmitted\ninformation.\nId. at 231.\nThe Supreme Court in Hensley concluded that if a wanted\nflyer or bulletin has been issued on the basis of articulable\nfacts supporting a reasonable suspicion that a person has\ncommitted an offense, then reliance on that bulletin to perform\nan investigatory stop under Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968), is\njustified.  Hensley, 469 U.S. at 232.  But even if it turns out\nthat the flyer was issued in the absence of a reasonable\nsuspicion, an officer relying in good faith on the information\nhas a defense to a civil suit.  Turner v. Raynes, 611 F.2d 92, 93\n(5th Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 900 (1980) (officer\nrelying in good faith on an invalid arrest warrant has defense to\ncivil suit).  \nAdditionally, courts have developed the concept of\n“collective information,” which stands for the proposition that\n“probable cause is to be evaluated by the courts on the basis of\nthe collective information of the police rather than that of only\nthe officer who performs the act of arresting.”  Smith v. United\n23\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 32 of 49\nStates, 358 F.2d 833, 835 (D.C. Cir. 1966).  As the Court of\nAppeals for this Circuit stated in Williams v. United States, 308\nF.2d 326, 327 (D.C. Cir. 1962), “[t]he whole complex of swift\nmodern communication in a large police department would be a\nfutility if the authority of an individual officer was to be\ncircumscribed by the scope of his first hand knowledge of facts\nconcerning a crime or alleged crime.”  Significantly, the Court\nof Appeals in Smith stated that the applicability of its decision\nin Williams would be no different if it involved “officers from\ndifferent cities or even different police organizations. . . .” \nId., 358 F.2d at 836.\nAs the Second Circuit stated recently in United States v.\nColon, 250 F.3d 130 (2d Cir. 2001):\nThe collective knowledge doctrine was developed in\nrecognition of the fact that with large police departments\nand mobile defendants, an arresting officer might not be\naware of all the underlying facts that provided probable\ncause or reasonable suspicion, but may nonetheless act\nreasonably in relying on information received by other law\nenforcement officials.\nId. at 134.  \nThe foregoing principles of collective knowledge and the\nright to rely on information provided by another law enforcement\nofficial properly extend from the criminal arena to the area of\ncivil liability.  As the Fifth Circuit stated in Turner v.\nRaynes:\nIt would be a strange and unworkable rule that required a\nsheriff, at his peril, to determine the ultimate legal\n24\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 33 of 49\nvalidity of every warrant – regular on its face and issued\nby proper authority – before serving it.\n611 F.2d at 93.\nThe apparent reasonableness of MPD’s request was all that\nwas required to permit federal law enforcement officials to\nassist MPD.  Moreover, maintaining a Park Police line is far less\nof an intrusion than the Terry stop at issue in Hensley or\nWhitely.  The police line was requested by high level MPD\nofficials, who earlier had been dealing with the group and\nobserved that the group had earlier vandalized one commercial\narea and was concerned that the group would try to do it again. \nSee Chang Murphy Dec., ¶¶ 41, 43.  With the Park Police\nreasonably and objectively relying on the other police agency’s\nrequest, the Park Police are entitled to Hensley’s good-faith\ndefense.  The reason for this is clear: if backup officers are\nsomehow first required to inquire into all of the underlying\nfacts and circumstances before they provide assistance to another\nagency, effective law enforcement –- which sometimes requires\nofficers to make instant decisions and take actions to ensure\npublic safety –- would be seriously hindered.  Id. at ¶ 13.  In\nthis situation, the Park Police were aware that property damage\nhad been done by some individuals involved in the protests and\nreasonably responded to a request for assistance by the\nMetropolitan Police Department in forming a police line.  Id. at\n¶¶ 41, 43.   \n25\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 34 of 49\nAdditionally, “[a]s a general rule, mere presence at the\nscene of a search, without a showing of direct responsibility for\nthe action, will not subject an officer to liability.”  Ghandi v.\nPolice Dept. Of City of Detroit, 747 F.2d 338, 352 (6th Cir.\n1984).  As such, the Sixth Circuit has ruled that officers were\nnot liable when they had “no direct involvement in a search [but\nt]heir only function was to insure the integrity of the search .\n. . ”  Accord Hays v. Jefferson County, Ky., 668 F.2d 869, 874\n(6th Cir. 1982), Aquisto v. Danbert, No. 97-1668, 1998\nU.S.App.LEXIS 21694 (6th Cir. 1998)(Local Rule 24\nCitation)(officer who entered house but did not participate in\nsearch not liable).  This rationale applies in both search and\narrest situations, and therefore, the Park Police are not liable,\ngiven their limited role as part of a police line, and lack of\ninvolvement in the decision to make the arrests and the actual\narrests themselves. \nB.  The FBI\nPlaintiffs allege that the FBI was involved in allegedly\nillegal fingerprinting of the demonstrators arrested.  But the\nFBI’s only involvement in this regard was to process fingerprint\ncards given to them by MPD, after MPD officials took fingerprints\nfrom the demonstrators arrested.  Rice Dec., ¶ 10.  \nThe FBI is authorized to provide assistance to local law\nenforcement officials by virtue of 28 U.S.C. § 533.  Rice Dec.,\n26\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 35 of 49\n¶ 9; 1 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 31 (Mar. 22, 1977) at 31, found at\n1997 WL 18016.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 534(a)(1), the Attorney\nGeneral “shall acquire, collect, classify, and preserve\nidentification, criminal identification, crime and other\nrecords,” and the word “shall” denotes a requirement and not\nmerely an authorization.  United States v. Rosen, 343 F. Supp.\n804, 806 (S.D.N.Y. 1972).  The FBI has been delegated the duty to\ncollect this information pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 534(c).  See 28\nC.F.R. § 0.85(b) (FBI shall “collect and preserve fingerprints\nand identification records from criminal justice and other\ngovernmental agencies”).  Significantly, the FBI has no duty to\nindependently determine the validity of the arrests before\nentering fingerprints taken by local law enforcement into its\ncriminal database.  Crow v. Kelley, 512 F.2d 752, 754 (8th Cir.\n1975).\nThe foregoing demonstrates that the FBI CJIS employees who\ntook fingerprint cards from MPD officials and scanned the\ninformation into the FBI’s IAFIS were performing duties they are\nrequired to do by law.  Plaintiffs’ claims regarding the FBI\ninvolvement in the fingerprinting process, therefore, are\nunavailing.\nMoreover, the FBI does not disseminate arrestees’ \ninformation.  Rather, information concerning plaintiffs’ arrests\nwas scanned into the IAFIS databank, just like in the case of\n27\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 36 of 49\nevery other arrested individual who fingerprints are sent to the\nFBI.  Rice Dec., ¶ 14.  Further, access to the FBI’s databank is\nonly available to authorized police authorities.  Id.\nPlaintiffs also allege that the FBI was engaged in illegal\nsurveillance activities during the demonstrations.  The Rice\nDeclaration, however, explains that the FBI is responsible for\naddressing threats or acts of terrorism in the United States and\nis the lead federal agency for crisis management in connection\nwith weapons of mass destruction.  Rice Dec., ¶ 4.  In order for\nthe FBI to perform its responsibilities, it obviously had to\nengage in surveillance of the crowds in order to look for\npossible terrorist or criminal activity.  Id. at ¶¶ 6-8. \nSignificantly, the FBI only engaged in surveillance by direct\nobservation.  Rice Dec., ¶ 12.\nAs explained above, see supra at 19-20, the FBI’s\nsurveillance resulted in no harm to plaintiffs.  Rather, it was a\nproduct of the FBI’s legal responsibilities to deter potential\nterrorist or criminal activity.\nThus, the actions taken by the Park Police and the FBI were\nentirely within their legal responsibilities.4\n     4  Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint provides no\nindication of the “other federal agencies” or what these other\ndefendants allegedly did wrong.  Id. at ¶¶ 48, 168.  As such, any\nunidentified claims against unidentified parties must be\ndismissed.  While federal notice pleading standards demand\nlittle, each defendant is entitled to notice of the wrongs with\nwhich he is charged.  See Sparrow v. United Air Lines, 216 F.3d\n28\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 37 of 49\nIII. Plaintiffs’ Common Law Tort Claims Against The\nFederal Defendants Must Be Dismissed.         \nTo the extent the Complaint seeks to raise the common law\ntorts of false arrest and false imprisonment, such claims must be\ndismissed against federal defendant United States.5  One\nprerequisite for filing a civil tort action under the FTCA is\nthat the claimant must first file an administrative claim\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2675(a).  This provision is\njurisdictional and cannot be waived by equitable considerations\nor otherwise.  Hohri v. United States, 782 F.2d 227, 245-46 (D.C.\nCir. 1986), reh. denied, 793 F.2d 304 (D.C. Cir. 1986), rev'd on\nother grounds sub nom. United States v. Hohri, 482 U.S. 64\n(1987); Stokes v. United States Postal Service, 937 F. Supp. 11,\n1111, 1117 (D.C. Cir. 2000); Watt v. City of Highland Park, 2001\nWL 1090152 * 2 (N.D. Ill. 2001) (“A major problem facing the\ncourt in trying to determine if plaintiffs’ second amended\ncomplaint satisfies this minimal standard is that plaintiffs have\npleaded their claim against all of the defendants without\ndifferentiation.”)(quoting Ryan v. Mary Immaculate Queen Center,\n188 F.3d 857, 860 (7th Cir. 1999)(“It is true that all the\nfederal rules require of a complaint is that it put the defendant\non notice of the plaintiff’s claim; but notice implies some\nminimum description of defendant’s complained-of conduct.”).  \n     5  It does not appear that the Amended Complaint seeks to\nraise any common law tort claims directly against any individual\nfederal defendants.  Should plaintiffs indicate otherwise, a\ncertification can be filed, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2679(d),\nsubstituting the United States as the sole defendant in place of\nany individual federal defendants against whom common law tort\nclaims have been made in connection with actions taken during the\nscope of such defendant’s employment.  But the Amended Complaint\nsets forth no factual allegations of common law tort against\nidentified individual federal defendants.\n29\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 38 of 49\n14 (D.D.C. 1996) (An administrative claim \"is a mandatory\njurisdictional prerequisite to filing a lawsuit against the\nUnited States.\").   This statutory requirement requires the\nputative plaintiff to file with the agency: \"(1) a written\nstatement sufficiently describing the injury to enable the agency\nto begin its own investigation, and (2) a sum-certain damages\nclaim.\"  GAF Corp. v. United States, 818 F.2d 901, 919 (D.C. Cir.\n1987).  The purpose of the requirement is to enable the agency\n\"to determine whether settlement or negotiations to that end are\ndesirable\" and thus perhaps obviate the need for litigation.  Id.\nat 920.\nThe Complaint alleges no compliance with the FTCA's\nadministrative claim requirements.  See Complaint generally. \nAccordingly, plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under the\nFTCA.  Therefore, to the extent that the Complaint seeks to raise\nany common law tort claims against the federal government, such\nclaims must be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative\nremedies.\nIV. Plaintiffs’ Civil Conspiracy Claims Should\nBe Dismissed Pursuant To Federal \nRule 12(b)(1) And 12(b)(6).               \nA. Plaintiffs’ Complaint Does Not Meet the Pleadings\nStandard Required for Pleading A Conspiracy to\nViolate Civil Rights.                            \nPlaintiffs appear to allege that the federal defendants\nconspired with the District of Columbia defendants to violate\n30\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 39 of 49\nplaintiffs’ First Amendment rights.  See First Amended Complaint\n¶¶ 57-59, 159, 168.  First and foremost, plaintiffs cite only to\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 to support their civil conspiracy claim and that\nstatute only applies to state actors; not the federal defendants. \nSee First Amended Complaint, ¶¶ 192-197; Jett v. Dallas\nIndependent School Dist., 491 U.S. 701, 735 (1989).  Despite this\npleading failure, the Amended Complaint appears to allege that\nthe FBI, the Park Police, and other federal agencies conspired to\nviolate plaintiffs’ constitutional rights.  See id. at ¶¶ 57-59,\n159, 168.  To the extent plaintiffs’ are attempting to allege\nfederal participation in an alleged conspiracy their claims fail\nfor three reasons.  First and foremost, no such conspiracy\noccurred.  Second, there is no evidence of a conspiracy. \nFinally, the plaintiffs’ claims are so inartfully pled they fail\nas a matter of law.\ni. Lawful Conduct Does Not a Conspiracy Make.\nThe fact that the FBI is charged with being “[t]he lead\nagency for crisis management,” which includes coordination,\nplanning and training of federal, state, and local resources to\nrespond to mass demonstrations, does not suffice to make the FBI\na party.  Rice Dec. ¶ 4.  If the Park Police or the FBI could be\nmade a party based on such allegations alone, the Park Police and\nthe FBI would be a party to every case arising from a mass\ndemonstration in the District of Columbia, regardless of their\n31\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 40 of 49\nactual role in the events.  Chang Murphy Dec., ¶ 4; Rice Dec., ¶¶\n3-5.  \nAccording to the First Amended Complaint, it was the MPD,\nnot the FBI or the Park Police, who engaged in the alleged\nunlawful conduct and who made the decision to arrest plaintiffs. \nIn fact, there is not a single, specific allegation to support a\nfinding that the FBI, the Park Police or any other unidentified\nfederal agencies violated plaintiffs' constitutional rights.  The\nfact that the FBI and the Park Police had some duties with regard\nto the 2002 WB/IMF conference is insufficient to make them\nparties to this case.\nThe FBI is tasked with protecting the public and the\nnation's security in various ways.  This requires information and\ndata gathering, training, coordination and planning.  See, e.g.,\n28 C.F.R. § 0.85 (setting out FBI responsibilities).  These are\nthe very actions of which plaintiffs complain.  Moreover,\nplanning for the more than 3,000 demonstrations and special\nevents per year in the District of Columbia requires the Park\nPolice normally to coordinate with local police authorities. \nChang Murphy Dec., ¶ 4. Simply conducting federal business as\ntasked does not give rise to a cause of action. \n  ii. Plaintiffs’ Cannot Establish Facts to Support\nTheir Ill-Pled Civil Conspiracy Claim.       \nTo establish the elements of a civil conspiracy plaintiffs\nmust prove four elements: (1) an agreement between two or more\n32\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 41 of 49\npersons (2) to participate in an unlawful act or a lawful act in\nunlawful manner; and (3) an injury caused by an unlawful overt\nact performed by one of the parties to the agreement (4) pursuant\nto and in furtherance of the common scheme.  Halberstam v. Welch,\n705 F.2d 472, 477 (D.C. Cir. 1983); Riggs v. Home Builders\nInstitute, 203 F. Supp.2d 1, 25 (D.D.C. 2002).  There is no\nrecognized independent tort action for civil conspiracy in the\nDistrict of Columbia.  Rather, civil conspiracy is a means for\nestablishing vicarious liability for an underlying tort. \nHalberstam, 705 F.2d at 479.  Thus, a successful civil conspiracy\nclaim depends on the performance of some tortious act.  Riggs,\n203 F. Supp. 2d at 25; Halberstam, 705 F.2d at 477 (quoting W.\nProsser, Law of Torts § 46, 293 (4th ed. 1971) (“To establish\nliability, plaintiffs also must prove that an unlawful overt act\nproduced an injury and damages.  ‘It is only where means are\nemployed, or purposes are accomplished, which are themselves\ntortious, that the conspirators who have not acted but have\npromoted the act will be held liable.’”).  Conspirators,\ntherefore, may only be held liable for acts committed by co-\nconspirators “if the acts are within the scope of the agreement,\nare done in furtherance of the conspiracy, and are reasonably\nforeseeable.”  Ungar v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 211 F. Supp.2d\n91, 100 (D.D.C. 2002).\n  While it is undisputed that the federal agencies\n33\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 42 of 49\ncoordinated with local authorities in preparing for the 2002\nIMF/WB conference, there is no evidence of an agreement to\nviolate constitutional rights - or any evidence of discussions\nconcerning such violations.  Moreover, the only evidence\navailable indicates that the federal defendants were merely\nengaged in fulfilling their statutory obligations.  There is no\nevidence that the federal agencies turned a blind eye to alleged\nconstitutional violations.  And there is even less evidence that\nduring the inevitable coordination and planning, constitutional\nviolations were contemplated.\nTo establish the first element of a conspiracy the agreement\nmust be an “agreement to participate” in tortious conduct. \nUngar, 211 F. Supp. 2d at 99.  The fact the Park Police and the\nFBI coordinated with local and federal authorities is\ninsufficient absent a showing that they agreed to the alleged\nsubsequent violation of rights.  Although “[p]roof of a tacit, as\nopposed to explicit, understanding is sufficient to show\nagreement,” more than simply joint action is required. \nHalberstam, 705 F.2d at 477.  Relevant factors include the\nrelationship between the parties’ acts, the time and place of\ntheir execution, and the duration of the joint activity.  Id.;\nUngar, 211 F. Supp. 2d at 100.\nWhile “‘acts that are in themselves legal lose that\ncharacter when they become constituent elements of an unlawful\n34\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 43 of 49\nscheme,’” Lawrence, 665 F.2d at 20-21 (quoting Continental Co. v.\nUnion Carbide Co., 370 U.S. 690, 707 (1962)), that is not what\noccurred here.  There was never an agreement or a scheme to\nviolate constitutional rights.  Thus, even if, arguendo, the\nfederal defendants somehow furthered MPD’s “scheme” to violate\nplaintiffs’ constitutional rights, the federal defendants failed\nto take any “overt unlawful act, or lawful act in an unlawful\nmanner.”  Halberstam 705 F.2d at 477 (“It is only where means are\nemployed . . . which are themselves tortious, that the\nconspirators who have not acted but have promoted the act will be\nliable.”).  Thus, the federal defendants’ lawful actions cannot\ngive rise to any liability. \niii.  Conspiracy Claims must Be Pled with Specificity. \nPlaintiffs’ conspiracy allegation(s) against the federal\ndefendants also must fail because it does not meet the standards\nrequired for pleading a civil conspiracy claims.  Thomas v. News\nWorld Communications et al., 681 F. Supp. 55 (D.D.C. 1988)(citing\nHobson v. Wilson 737 F.2d 1 (D.C. Cir. 1984)).6  “A party must\n     6 Although a \"heightened pleading standard\"  for § 1983\nclaims, and other cases in which qualified immunity was a likely\ndefense, was rejected in Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574,\n598 (1998), the Supreme Court made it clear that it does not mean\nto allow mere generalized unsupported assertions to state a cause\nof action.  The Court suggested that demanding a more definite\nstatement, and “limit[ing] the time, place, and manner of\ndiscovery or even barr[ing] discovery altogether were appropriate\n“so that officials are not subjected to unnecessary and\nburdensome discovery.” Crawford-El, 523 U.S. at 598-99.  The\nCourt suggested that the “court could grant the defendant’s\n35\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 44 of 49\nstate with specificity the facts that he believes show the\nexistence and scope of the alleged conspiracy, regardless of\nwhether his claim is against a private party or a public\nofficial.”  Hudson v. Kagan-Kans et al., 1993 WL 32358 *1 (D.C.\nCir. 1993).  A plaintiff is required to allege a connection\nbetween the overt acts, the furtherance of the conspiracy and the\nplaintiff’s injury.  Graves v. United States of America, 961 F.\nSupp. 314 (D.D.C. 1997) (court dismissed plaintiff’s complaint\nbecause it failed to show with “particularity what acts a\ndefendant performed to carry the conspiracy into effect, how\nthose acts fit into the conspiracy, and how injury to the\nplaintiff was forseeable”); Martin v. Malhoyt, 830 F.2d 237, 258\n(D.C. Cir. 1987) (“[u]nsupported factual allegations which fail\nto specify in detail the factual basis necessary to enable\n[defendants] to intelligently prepare their defense, will not\nsuffice to sustain a claim of governmental conspiracy to deprive\n[plaintiffs] of their constitutional rights.”)\n“Plaintiffs have a ‘weighty burden to establish a civil\nrights conspiracy’ and must allege facts that would at least\nmotion for a more definite statement” and “may insist that the\nplaintiff ‘put forward specific nonconclusory factual\nallegations’ that establish improper motive causing cognizable\ninjury in order to survive a prediscovery motion for dismissal or\nsummary judgment.  This option exists even if the official\nchooses not to plead the affirmative defense of qualified\nimmunity. Id. at 598 (quoting Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U.S. 226\n(1991)).\n36\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 45 of 49\nraise an inference ‘that each member of the alleged conspiracy\nshared the same conspiratorial objective.’”  Cottom v. Town of\nSeven Devils, 2000 WL 1808990 *4 (W.D.N.C.) (quoting Hinkle v.\nCity of Clarksburg, 81 F.3d 416, 421 (4th Cir. 1996)).  “Mere\nallegations of joint action or a conspiracy are not sufficient to\nsurvive a motion to dismiss; . . . in order to allege a [civil\nrights] conspiracy, a plaintiff needs to describe the ‘form and\nscope’ of the conspiracy such as the term of the agreements\nconstituting the conspiracy, when these agreements were formed,\nand what the participants’ roles were.”  Watt v. City of Highland\nPark, 2001 WL 1090152 *7 (N.D. Ill.)(citations omitted.) \nHere, plaintiffs have pled no facts that support a claim of\na conspiracy to violate their constitutional rights.  Legal\nconclusions mischaracterized as facts do not state a claim for a\ncause of action for conspiracy against federal defendants.  Kowal\nv. MCI Communications Corp., 16 F.3d 1271, 1276 (D.C. Cir. 1994).\nAccordingly, to the extent that the Amended Complaint can be\nread to raise a claim for conspiracy to violate constitutional\nrights, such a claim should be dismissed.\n37\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 32    Filed 04/25/03   Page 46 of 49\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons stated above, federal defendants' motion to\ndismiss, or in the alternative, for summary judgment should be\ngranted.\nRespectfully submitted,\n                                         \nROSCOE C.

The 17 Class Representatives shall collectively receive a total of $850,000 ($50,000 per \nnamed Class Representative). \n2.  Each member ofthe class (355 class members) shall receive compensation from the \nClaimants' Fund of$4,788,000 (subject to allocation, distribution and possible reversion \nof funds to the District), if a timely notice of claim and submission of proof of \nentitlement is submitted to and approved by the fund administrator in the following \nmanner. \ni.  Should the participation rate be higher than 75% of eligible ~laimants (266 \nparticipating claimants), each claimant shall be allocated and awarded a pro-rata share \nof Claimants' Funds. This will result in a payment to each of some measure less than \n$18,000. \nii.  Should the participation rate be equal to or lower than 75% of eligible claimants (266 \nparticipating claimants), each claimant shall be allocated and awarded a pro rata share \nof Claimants' Fund, subject to a maximum of $18,000. Under nearly all \ncircumstances, this will result in a payment to each of $18,000. The District shall \nreceive reversion of unallocated Claimant Funds. \n3.  The Claimants' Fund of $4,788,000 is the ceiling on the District's payments to the class \nclaimants. \n4.  The cost of administrating the funds and determining or adjudicating submitted claims is \nallocated to be $150,000.  In the event that actual costs for Notification and \nAdministration, including costs associated with determining class eligibility of any \nclaimants whose identities and arrests are not reflected in law enforcement or government \nrecords, exceed the $150,000 allocation, the excess costs will be shared and paid for by \n'ti \n5 \ninitials, on behalf of District Defendants \non behalf of plaintiffs \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 595-3   Filed 03/05/10   Page 6 of 24\nthe Claimants and the District of Columbia equally, on a 50-50% basis. The payments for \nsuch excess expenditures, if any, on behalf of Claimants shall be paid from within \nClaimants' Funds. Such payments on behalf of the District may be paid from reversion \nfunds, or from the Settlement and Judgment fund, as may be determined by the District. \n5.  The attorney's fees and cost allocation is $2,463,333. \n6.  With respect to monetary relief, the notice and claim process shall provide individual \nclass members with an opportunity to request exclusion, or to \"opt out,\" from the \nmonetary portion of the Settle~ent Agreement.

Notification and Administration Funds) and for All Attorney's \nFees and Costs \nThe District of Columbia shall deposit funds into an escrow account to be administered by the Class \nAdministrator in accordance with the timing and schedule set forth herein. The deposit of funds into the \nescrow account is distinct from the actual disbursement of funds from the escrow account to recipients. \n1s t Deposit: Within 45 days of the Preliminary District Court Approval, the District of Columbia \nwill deposit the $150,000 constituting the Notification and Administration Funds. \n2nd Deposit: Within 45 days of Final District Court Approval, or by September 30,2010 if there is \nno final approval of the settlement, which-ever comes first, the District will deposit the Class \nRepresentatives' Funds ($850,000), and 60% of the remaining Class Settlement Funds (including 60% of \nthe amount allocated for attorney's fees and costs). \n6  U \n~ \ninitials, on behalf of Districl Defendanls \nC; \non behalf of plaintiffs \nL \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 595-3   Filed 03/05/10   Page 7 of 24\n3rd Deposit. After Final District Court Approval, the District will deposit the remainder of the \nClaimant Fund and Attorneys Fees and Costs Funds (the balance left after the 1st and 2nd payments minus \nany reversion of Claimant Funds to the District) by September 1,2011. \nC.  Timing of Distribution of Funds to Class Representatives, Fund Administrator, \nClaimants and Payment of Fees and Costs \n1.  Upon Preliminary District Court Approval of the settlement, and upon deposit by the \nDistrict, the $150,000 for Notification and Administration Funds shall be made available \nto the Class Administrator. \n2.  Plaintiffs and the Class Administrator shall petition the Court for authority to release \nfunds to the Class Representatives, Claimants and Class Counsel. \n3.  However, no funds may be distributed to the Class Representatives, Class \nMembers/Claimants or Class Counsel (attorney's fees and costs) without both Final \nDistrict Court Approval of the settlement and the exhaustion of all appeals and any period \nof time in which an objector or challenger may seek review by way of a Writ of \nCertiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court. \n4.  In the event the settlement is not upheld on appeal or is reversed upon review by the U.S. \nSupreme Court, all funds (with interest) minus the spent administrative costs shall be \nreturned to the District \nIII. Class-Wide Prospective Relief \nA.  Expungement and Annulment of Arrests \n1.  Expungement and annulment relief was granted by Court Order dated January 28,2008 \n(Dkt. No. 405).

The Class Administrator or its designee shall be the determinator of the class \neligibility of Claimants, consistent with the class definition approved by the Court \nin the settlement of this action. \nb.  A Claimant shall be deemed eligible ifhis or her identity is reflected in a \ngovernment or law enforcement or court record(s) as having been arrested in \nconnection with the underlying class arrest. \n(i)  A government or law enforcement record is any record created or issued or \nmaintained by a law enforcement agency, a government agency or court. \n(ii) The record need not have been maintained in the exclusive custody of \ngovernment, and can be constituted by a law enforcement or government or \ncourt receipt or record issued to the claimant in relation to the arrest or \nrelease. \n(iii)The record/form/item need not be strictly denominated as an \"arrest record\" in \norder to establish class qualification. For example, any of the following \nrecords would be acceptable if they evidence identity and class membership: \nbus/van transport log; record of judicial release or processing; a property \nreceipt or bag; citation release or post-and-forfeit form or record, etc. \n(iv) If circumstances arise where an individual is identified as being arrested on \nthe relevant day, but records are ambiguous or contradictory as to the location \n20 \ninitials, on behalf of District Defendants \non behalf of plaintiffs \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 595-3   Filed 03/05/10   Page 21 of 24\nor circumstances of arrest as being consistent with the qualifying mass arrest, \nthe Class Administrator is to provide Class Counsel and Defense Counsel the \nidentity and any other pertinent information pertaining to the claimant and \nrequest in writing that counsels, upon independent review of their and law \nenforcement records, advise whether they possess any information related to \nthe claimant's class membership. \nc.  The Class Administrator may develop processes or standards to qualify persons \nwho are believed or determined by the Class Administrator to have, in fact, been \nsubject to the underlying mass arrest but whose arrest is not properly or \ncompletely documented in law enforcement records, subject to and within the \nfollowing guidelines: \n(i)  Where a Claimant attests to class membership, but the fact of his or her arrest \nis not documented in law enforcement records, the Class Administrator shall \nprovide to Class Counsel and Defense Counsel the identity and any other \npertinent information pertaining to the claimant and request in writing that \ncounsels, upon independent review of their and law enforcement records, \nadvise whether they possess any information related to the claimant's class \nmembership. \n(ii) Class qualification may be established where such individual can provide to \nthe Class Administrator's satisfaction that he or she was, in fact, subject to the \nunderlying class arrest through presentation of information and/or evidence. \nSuch information or evidence is not intended to be strictly limited to any \nparticular form or format, and may for example include photographic \nif \n21  J \ninitials, on behalf of District Defendants  2 \non behalf of plaintiffs \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 595-3   Filed 03/05/10   Page 22 of 24\nevidence of the claimant under arrest, but must be deemed sufficiently reliable \nand relevant for the Class Administrator to make a determination, which shall \nrest in the Class Administrator or designee's sole judgment. \n(iii)In such circumstances, in addition to whatever other presentation he or she \nmay make to the satisfaction of the Class Administrator, such Claimant shall \nbe required to secure and submit sworn and notarized affidavits from two \nqualified Class Members attesting that each possesses personal knowledge, \nsubject to penalty of peIjury, that claimant was subject to the underlying mass \narrest in Pershing Park specifically. For the purposes of this subsection, each \nof the two qualified Class Members shall be required to have been qualified \nbased on their arrest being documented and manifest in law enforcement, \ngovernment or court records. \nd.  The Class Administrator, working in conjunction with Class Counsel, may \ndevelop and implement additional criteria or standards for determining the \neligibility of persons who were juveniles at the time of arrest. \ne.  The Class Administrator shall be required to maintain Claimant information and \nrecords in strict confidentiality, to be used solely for the purposes of class \nadministration. \n£  The Class Representatives on behalf of the Class and the District defendants \nrecognize that class identification data is reflected to certain partial extent in \nrecords from multiple sources, primarily in hard copy format, and that such data \nmay need to be scanned, parsed, aggregated, de-duplicated, and organized in a \nmeaningful manner or database to facilitate class member determinations. The \ntv \n22 \ninitials, on behalf of District Defendants \nb 7ft \non behalf of plaintiffs \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 595-3   Filed 03/05/10   Page 23 of 24\nClass Administrator is authorized to take whatever steps are necessary to \nundertake such efforts itself or through a third-party contractor. If a third-party \ninfonnation technologies contractor or finn is utilized, that contractor or finn will \nbe required to agree in writing to maintaining all infonnation in confidence and to \nreturn/destroy such data upon task completion. \n11. Return of Documents: Plaintiffs shall return to the District of Columbia all documents \nand any copies thereof produced by the District of Columbia that are subject to a \nprotective order, within 30 days of the tennination of~e case and the expiration of the \nperiod for any appeals or objections. \n12.

Multiple Originals Acceptable: The Parties agree that multiple originals of this \nSettlement Agreement may be executed. The Parties' or counsel's signatures need not \nappear on the same signature page. \n14.

Rules 1, 16, 23, 26, and 42, (1) consolidating these cases for\npurposes of discovery and (2) consolidating these cases for purposes of trial, or, in the\nalternative, restricting the number of cases through which plaintiffs may pursue permanent\ninjunctive relief against the defendants.  The relief requested is consistent with this Court’s\nrecognition of the merits of consolidation in the litigation of these cases in its Memorandum\nDecision and Order, dated September 19, 2003.  Further, the requested relief is suited to\nachieving the just, speedy, and inexpensive resolution of these cases as mandated by the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure.  These reasons are explained in greater detail in the accompanying,\nsupporting memorandum of points and authorities, which is incorporated into this motion by\nreference.\nPursuant to LCvR 7.1(m), undersigned counsel communicated the District Defendants’\nrequest for relief sought through this motion with counsel for each of the other parties.  MPD\nAssistant Chief Peter Newsham does not oppose the consolidation of these cases for purposes of\ndiscovery and trial, but does not waive any jurisdictional challenges or defenses available to him.\nThe Jones plaintiffs do not oppose the relief requested.  Oppositions to the motion are anticipated \n2\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 79    Filed 11/24/03   Page 3 of 4\nfrom the Federal Defendants, the Chang plaintiffs, the Abbate plaintiffs and the Barham\nplaintiffs.\nRespectfully submitted,\nROBERT J.

The District agrees to perform the requirements of the Document Management \nand Retention Requirements for a period of no less than three years from the \nCourt's final approval of settlement of this matter upon these terms and the \nexhaustion of any appeals (including any petition for writ of certiorari to the \nUnited States Supreme Court). \nc.  The Document Management and Retention Requirements may be extended \nfor no more than two one year periods upon motion by the District of \nColumbia if the District of Columbia believes that such an extension is \nrequired to bring the defendants into compliance with the requirements of the \nsettlement. The parties' intent is to fully fund, through the Settlement \nAgreement, the acquisition, development and training costs for the Document \nManagement System, which would be expected to be greater in the initial \nyears of implementation than in subsequent periods, and to establish funding \n8 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 640   Filed 09/22/10   Page 9 of 9\nfor three years, or as may be extended, a period of time believed to be amply \nsufficient for the use and benefits of the system to be well established. \nd.  The United States District Court shall retain jurisdiction for the purpose of \nenforcing the requirements of the Document Management and Retention \nRequirements for three years from the Court's final approval of the settlement \nof this matter and exhaustion of any appeals (including any Petition for Writ \nof Certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court). \ne.  The Plaintiffs do not have a right of enforcement more than three years from \nthe date of Final District Court Approval and the exhaustion of any appeals \n(including any petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme \nCourt). \niii.  Except as provided above, the remedy for enforcement is by way ofa  breach of \ncontract claim subject to the notice and cure provision. \nUnited States District Judge \n9 ",

      "text": "Case 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 171    Filed 10/22/04   Page 1 of 3\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \nJEFFREY BARHAM, et al., \nPlaintiffs, \nv.  Civ. Action No. 02-02283 (EGS) (AK) \nCHARLES H. RAMSEY, et aI., \nDefendants. \nDEFENDANT CHIEF CHARLES H. RAMSEY'S FILING \nCONCERNING THE RECORD ON HIS SUMMARY JUDGMENT \nMOTION REGARDING ARRESTS AT VERMONT AND K STREETS \nDefendant, Chief Charles H. Ramsey, respectfully submits this filing concerning \nthe record upon which his Motion For Summary Judgment Upon Claims Subject To \nQualified Immunity (\"Motion\") was based and argued.  Chief Ramsey, through his \ncounsel, has reviewed this Court's Memorandum Decision, dated September 24,2004, \ngranting, in part, and denying, in part, Chief Ramsey's Motion and the transcript ofthe \noral argument regarding that Motion heard by this Court on June 14,2004. \nChief Ramsey has determined that some statements of his counsel at that hearing \nwere less than models of clarity.  The Court's September 24, 2004 Memorandum \nDecision reflects, at 38, that this Court credited the representations of Chief Ramsey's \ncounsel concerning Chief Ramsey's involvement in arrests made at Vermont and K \n'Streets, N.W., on September 27,2002, in granting Chief Ramsey qualified immunity \nregarding those arrests.  Chief Ramsey believes that the Court properly decided that \nissue.  However, in his view, the record of the oral argument is sufficiently ambiguous \nthat his counsel's representations may have been understood to assert facts other than \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 171    Filed 10/22/04   Page 2 of 3\nthose Chief Ramsey understands to be accurate.  Accordingly, Chief Ramsey submits this \nfiling in order that this Court's decision not be based upon an ambiguity, \nmisunderstanding, or miscommunication.  In doing so, Chief Ramsey understands that \nthis filing may cause the Court to review or reconsider, sua sponte, its own ruling \nregarding his entitlement to qualified immunity for the Vermont and K Streets arrests. \nIn granting Chief Ramsey qualified immunity regarding the arrests made at \nVermont and K Streets, N.W., the Court made the following observation: \nSimply stated, there is no record evidence that Chief Ramsey was \non the scene of Vermont and K Streets at the time of the arrest, and the \nCourt accepts Chief Ramsey's assertion through counsel, that Chief \nRamsey was not present.  Tr. 4/6/04 at 39.  Further, unlike the arrests in \nPershing Park, there is no record evidence suggesting that Chief Ramsey \nin any way approved the Vermont and K Streets arrests.  Given that Chief \nRamsey did not actively participate in the arrests, he could only be held \npersonally liable on a theory of failure to supervise Assistant Chief Jordan. \nAs discussed, supra, however, a \"supervisor who merely fails to detect \nand prevent a subordinate's misconduct  ... cannot be liable for that \nmisconduct.\"  International Action Center, 365 F.3d at 28. \nMemorandum Decision at 37-38.  Chief Ramsey understands the Court's analysis to be \nbased, in part, upon the representations of his counsel to the Court, as reflected at pages \n38-43.  Fair readings of the transcript and the Memorandum Decision permit the \ninference that the record reflected and the Court understood that Chief Ramsey was not \npresent at Vermont and K Streets at any point related to the arrests there.  That would not \nbe correct. \nAs reflected in the transcript, at 41 : 4-6, Chief Ramsey went from point to point \nthroughout the District on the morning of September 27, 2002, and did make \nobservations and did have conversations at various locations.  Chief Ramsey recalls \nhaving briefly been at Vermont and K Streets, that morning.  However, he has no \n2 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 171    Filed 10/22/04   Page 3 of 3\nrecollection of having had any conversation with Assistant Chief Jordan at that location \nor of observing arrests there.  Chief Jordan has no recollection of having seen Chief \nRamsey at Vermont and K Streets that morning, much less consulting with Chief \nRamsey, at all, regarding Chief Jordan's decision to make the arrests at Vermont and K \nStreets.  This is wholly consistent with the declaration of Assistant Chief Jordan \nsubmitted in support of the Motion.  Further, this is entirely consistent with the Court's \nfindings of \"no record evidence suggesting that Chief Rarnsey in any way approved the \nVermont and K arrests,\"  or that Chief Rarnsey actively participated in any way in those \narrests.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nThe IMF and World Bank annually conduct meetings in\nWashington D.C; these meetings historically draw small, peaceful\nprotests.  Over the past several years, however, the protests\nhave grown in size, as has the number of protest-related arrests. \nOver an eight-day period in April 2000, more than 1000 people\nwere arrested in Washington D.C. during protests related to the\n2000 IMF/World Bank Meetings.  Protests in 2001 were minimal, and\nno arrests were made, as the meetings were canceled following the\nevents of September 11, 2001.   \n The MPD believed that the 2002 meetings were likely to draw\nlarge, potentially violent and destructive protests, largely\nbecause recent anti-globalization protests in Seattle had seen\nacts of violence and breaches of the peace.  See Newsham Mot. to\nDismiss in 02-2283 at 5.  Prior to the scheduled September 2002\nMeetings, the MPD Civil Disturbance Unit (“CDU”) members received\ntraining in preparation for the expected protests.  Chief Ramsey\n4\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 5 of 53\nwas in overall command of MPD’s operation plan and handling of\nthe expected parades and demonstrations.   Four Assistant Chiefs\nwere charged with responsibility for specific areas of the city;\nAssistant Chief Newsham was responsible for the zone encompassing\nPershing Park.  In addition, MPD developed  “post and forfeit”\nand “citation release” options for people arrested for\nmisdemeanors; these procedures would allow arrestees to post and\nforfeit collateral and then be released without having to await\narraignment in detention.   The plan allowed for arrestees to be\nprocessed at three centers within the District.  Ramsey and\nWilliams Statement of Material Facts in 02-2283 ¶¶ 42-45; Ramsey\nStatement of Material Facts in 03-767 ¶¶ 42-45. \nOn the day of the protests, Chief Ramsey heard via police\nradio that “significant activity” was taking place in Pershing\nPark, and thus proceeded to Pershing Park.  When he arrived,\nAssistant Chief Newsham advised him that the people in Pershing\nPark would be arrested based on his personal observation and\nreports from MPD subordinates that the people in the Park had\nengaged in unlawful acts prior to congregating in the Park,\nincluding refusing MPD officers’ commands to move from the\nroadway, and knocking over trash receptacles and newspaper\nvending machines.  Williams and Ramsey Statement of Material\nFacts in 02-2283 ¶ 32; Ramsey Statement of Material Facts in 03-\n5\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 6 of 53\n767 ¶ 32.   Assistant Chief Newsham asserts that he walked around\nthe perimeter of the park for 45 minutes, and observed that some\nprotestors were wearing masks and taunting police officers. \nNewsham Statement of Material Facts in 02-2283 ¶¶ 46-47;  Newsham\nStatement of Material Facts in 03-767 ¶¶ 46-47.  Assistant Chief\nNewsham gave the order for the mass arrest, “correctly believing\nthat, based on what he advised Chief Ramsey in their\nconversation, Chief Ramsey tacitly approved . . . Newsham’s\ndecision.”  Williams and Ramsey Statement of Material Facts in\n02-2283 ¶ 38; see also Newsham Statement of Material Facts in 03-\n767 ¶ 49. \nAs admitted during oral argument at the April 6, 2004,\nMotions Hearing, it is undisputed that Assistant Chief Newsham\ndid not give an order to disperse prior to effectuating the mass\narrest.  April 6, 2004, Motions Hearing Transcript (“Tr.”) at 6\n(defense counsel for Ramsey and Williams confirming that no\nnotice to disperse was given); see also Newsham Statement of\nMaterial Facts in 03-767 ¶ 54 (stating “Assistant Chief Newsham\ndid not give orders for the demonstrators to clear the Park”). \nThe Park was cordoned off on all sides by 10:15 a.m., and all of\nthe people in the Park were arrested.  Newsham Statement of\nMaterial Facts in 03-767 ¶ 53. \n6\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 7 of 53\nOn the same day, a large number of people were also arrested\nat or near Vermont Avenue and K Street, N.W..  Assistant Chief\nBrian Jordan, who was responsible for the area during the\nprotests, ordered a mass arrest.  Williams and Ramsey Statement\nof Material Facts in 02-2283 ¶ 53.   Assistant Chief Jordan\nasserts that, after observing protestors “ignoring vehicular\ntraffic,” he determined that “in order to ensure the public’s\nsafety, the only recourse was to effect the arrests of all\nprotestors who were marching illegally.”  Jordan Decl. ¶¶ 4,5.\nIt is undisputed that, despite the planned availability of\nexpedited citation release, there were lengthy delays in\nprisoner processing.  MPD attributes these delays to information\ntechnology malfunctions and operational adjustments, including\nthe Information Technology (“IT”) system falling non-operational\nuntil the evening of September 27, 2002; incompatibility\nproblems with cameras used to photograph arrestees and computer\nsoftware; and previously scheduled deactivation of the Criminal\nJustice Information System (CJIS).  Williams and Ramsey\nStatement of Material Facts in 02-2283 ¶¶ 46-50;  Ramsey\nStatement of Material Facts in 03-767 ¶¶ 46-50.   While in\ntransit and while being held, arrestees were restrained by\n“flexi-cuffs,” which are “plastic bands that operate much like\nsmall belts.”  Williams and Ramsey Statement of Material Facts\n7\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 8 of 53\nin 02-2283 ¶¶ 55-57.   Some arrestees, specifically the 200\narrestees who were detained at the MPD’s Institute for Police\nScience gymnasium (“IPS”), were restrained by a series of three\nflexi-cuffs, which attached an individual’s wrist to her\nopposite ankle and left the arrestee in a seated position.  \nWilliams and Ramsey Statement of Material Facts in 02-2283 ¶ 50.\nMPD After-Action Reports concluded that there were\n“deficiencies in the Department’s handling of aspects of the\nSeptember 27, 2002 events.”  Id. ¶ 58.  The MPD also concluded\nthat “the park had not been cleared of all persons before the\npersons who had been observed to have engaged in criminal\nmisconduct entered the park.  Nor had an order been given\nadvising all persons within the park to disperse.”  Id. ¶ 60;  \nRamsey Statement of Material Facts in 03-767 ¶ 58.  Chief Ramsey\nultimately issued an official reprimand to Assistant Chief\nNewsham for the failure to give warnings to disperse before\nconducting the mass arrests.  Id. ¶¶ 60-61; Ramsey Statement of\nMaterial Facts in 03-767 ¶¶ 58-59. \nPlaintiffs’ claims in both actions flow from these mass\narrests and subsequent detention.  The heart of their “trap and\narrest” charge is that police cordoned off the Pershing Park\narea,2 essentially “trapping” the protestors within the Park, and\n2 The arrests at Vermont and K Street are addressed infra.\n8\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 9 of 53\nthen initiated a mass arrest without first warning the protestors\nthat they must disperse to avoid arrest.  Plaintiffs argue that\nthese arrests, the resulting detention, and the use of\nrestraining force, violate clearly established constitutional\nprotections, and allege that Mayor Williams, Chief Ramsey, and\nAssistant Chief Newsham should be held liable in both their\nofficial and personal capacities for the constitutional injuries. \nThe three defendants argue that principles of qualified immunity\nshield them from any personal liability.   Thus, the question\ncurrently before the Court is not whether plaintiffs prevail on\ntheir underlying claims, but rather whether any or all of the\ndefendants could face personal liability if plaintiffs do\neventually prevail on their claims.\nIII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW\nIn appraising the sufficiency of a complaint, a court must\nfollow \"the accepted rule that a complaint should not be\ndismissed unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can\nprove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle\nhim to relief.\"  Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1957); see\nalso Swierkiewicz v. Sorema, 534 U.S. 506, 514 (2002) (stating\nthat a court may dismiss a complaint \"only if it is clear that no\nrelief could be granted under any set of facts that could be\n9\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 10 of 53\nproved consistent with the allegations\")(quoting Hishon v. King &\nSpalding, 467 U.S. 69, 73 (1984)).  For purposes of a motion to\ndismiss, a court must treat the plaintiff's factual allegations\nas true, and must liberally construe the complaint in favor of\nthe plaintiff.  See, e.g., Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 501\n(1975); Jenkins v. McKeithen, 395 U.S. 411, 421-422 (1969).\nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, summary\njudgment should be granted only if the moving party has shown\nthat there are no genuine issues of material fact and that the\nmoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  See\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56; Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325\n(1986); Waterhouse v. District of Columbia, 298 F.3d 989, 991\n(D.C. Cir. 2002).  As with the Court’s review of a motion to\ndismiss, the Court must view the evidence in the light most\nfavorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable\ninferences in favor of the non-moving party.  See Matsushita\nElec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587\n(1986).  However, when the moving party has carried its burden,\nthe non-movant must raise more than “some metaphysical doubt as\nto the material facts;” simply stated, only a genuine issue of\nfact will suffice to defeat a motion for summary judgment.  Id.\nat 586.\n10\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 11 of 53\nIV.  QUALIFIED IMMUNITY STANDARD\n“Qualified immunity shields officials from liability for\ndamages so long as their actions were objectively reasonable, as\nmeasured in the light of the legal rules that were ‘clearly\nestablished’ at the time of their actions.”  Lederman v. United\nStates, 291 F.3d 36, 46 (D.C. Cir. 2002); see also Butera v.\nDistrict of Columbia, 235 F.3d 637, 646-47 (D.C. Cir. 2001). \nOnce a qualified immunity defense is raised, the question becomes\nwhether the government official asserting qualified immunity\n“knew or reasonably should have known that the action he took\nwithin his sphere of official responsibility would violate the\nconstitutional rights of the [plaintiff], or if he took the\naction with the malicious intention to cause a deprivation of\nconstitutional rights or other injury.”  Harlow v. Fitzgerald,\n457 U.S. 800, 815 (1982).  In order for an immunity defense to be\ndefeated, “the contours of the right [must be] sufficiently clear\nthat a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing\nviolates that right.”  Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640\n(1987).   \n Thus, the qualified immunity analysis is essentially a two\nstep inquiry: (1) whether a constitutional violation has\noccurred, and (2) whether the violated right was “clearly\nestablished” at the time of the alleged violation.  Saucier v.\n11\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 12 of 53\nKatz, 533 U.S. 194, 200 (2001); International Action Center v.\nUnited States, 365 F.3d 20, 25 (D.C. Cir. 2004).  The question of\nwhether a right is “clearly established” involves an analysis of\n“whether the Supreme Court, the District of Columbia Circuit,\nand, to the extent that there is a consensus, other circuits have\nspoken clearly on the lawfulness of the conduct at issue.” \nButera, 235 F.3d at 652.  If it would “be clear to a reasonable\nofficer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he\nconfronted,” the right is considered clearly established.  Groh\nv. Ramirez, 124 S.Ct 1284, 1293 (2004) (quoting Saucier, 533 U.S.\nat 202); see also Butera, 235 F.3d at 646 (the constitutional\nright must be established “at the appropriate level of\nspecificity”). \nFinally, the Court must determine whether the defendant’s\nactions were objectively reasonable in light of the clearly\nestablished law.  It is no defense that an official was unaware\nof a law, as a “reasonably competent public official should know\nthe law governing his conduct.”  Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S.\n800, 818-819 (1982).   Thus, “a police officer should prevail on\nan assertion of qualified immunity if a reasonable officer\npossessing the same information could have believed that his\nconduct was lawful.”  District of Columbia v. Indiana Evans, 644\nA.2d 1008, 1025 (D.C. 1994).\n12\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 13 of 53\nV.  ANALYSIS\nA. Immunity for Arrests in Pershing Park in Civil Action 02-\n2283 and Civil Action 03-767\nPlaintiffs argue that the type of arrest at issue–-that is,\na mass arrest made without a previous order to disperse--has been\nclearly established as unconstitutional and unlawful. \nSpecifically, plaintiffs argue that Dellums v. Powell, 566 F.2d\n167 (D.C. Cir. 1977), establishes the clear contours and\nguidelines pertaining to a police officer’s authority to order a\nmass arrest. \nDellums arose on facts remarkably similar to the present\nlitigation.  There, Vietnam War protestors were arrested at the\nfoot of the Capitol steps; the area was cordoned off by police,\nall assembled were prevented from leaving, and mass arrests\nensued.  Dellums focused on the police chief’s immunity claim;\nspecifically, “whether Chief Powell acted in good faith in\narresting plaintiffs and whether his actions were reasonable in\nlight of all the circumstances.”  Dellums, 566 F.2d at 176. \nUpholding a jury verdict finding Chief Powell personally liable\nfor First and Fourth Amendment constitutional violations, the\nCourt noted it was the Chief’s burden to show that “he had an\nhonest belief that the plaintiffs as a group were violating the\n13\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 14 of 53\nlaw by assembling at the Capitol, and further, that this belief\nwas reasonable in light of the facts available to him at the\nscene of the arrests and the law as it then existed.”  Id. at 177\n(emphasis in original).   The Court concluded that\nplaintiffs  could  not  constitutionally  have  been\narrested  as  a  group  .  .  .  unless  Chief  Powell  had\nreason  to believe:  (1) that the plaintiffs comprised\none of the groups that could be banned or ordered from\nthe  Capitol  under  Nicholson;  (2)  that  orders  to\ndisperse had been given  which apprised the crowd as a\nwhole that it was under an obligation to leave; and (3)\nthat  a  reasonable  opportunity  had  been  given  the\nplaintiffs to leave the Capitol. This conclusion . . .\nin our judgment represents well settled law which Chief\nPowell  was  obliged  to  know  on  pain  of  losing  his\nqualified immunity.\nId. at 183 (emphasis added). \nThe Court agrees that Dellums establishes the contours of\nconstitutional protections in mass arrest cases.  While\ndefendants urge a reliance on Washington Mobilization Committee\nv. Cullinane, the Court notes that Dellums and Cullinane are not\ninconsistent.  While Cullinane stands for the proposition that\npolice officers do not have a duty to single out individuals for\narrest if a protest as a whole has turned violent, the Court,\nconsistent with Dellums, made clear that\nWe do not suggest of course that one who has violated\nno law may be arrested for the offenses of those who\nhave been violent or obstructive.  As we have seen  .\n.  .  the  police  may  validly  order  violent  or\nobstructive  demonstrators  to  disperse  or  clear  the\n14\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 15 of 53\nstreets.  If any demonstrator or bystander refuses to\nobey such an order after fair notice and opportunity\nto  comply,  his  arrest  does  not  violate  the\nConstitution  even  though  he  has  not  previously  been\nviolent or obstructive. \nCullinane, 566 F.2d 107, 120 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (emphasis added). \n1. Assistant Chief Newsham’s Immunity Claims for Pershing \nPark Arrests in Civil Action 02-2283 and Civil Action 03-\n7673\n   Assistant Chief Newsham asserts that the mass arrest on\nSeptember 27, 2002, was lawful and, even assuming arguendo that\nthe arrest was unconstitutional under Dellums and its progeny, he\nacted reasonably in ordering the mass arrest.  Specifically,\nAssistant Chief Newsham argues that notwithstanding his failure\nto give an order to disperse prior to effectuating arrests, there\nwas independent probable cause to arrest the protestors because\n(1) they had broken the law prior to entering the Park, (2) the\nprotestors’ presence in the Park was unlawful, and (3) he feared\n3  Assistant Chief Newsham’s motions to dismiss or for summary\njudgment on qualified immunity grounds in Civil Actions 02-2283\nand 03-767 focus solely on the mass arrest at Pershing Park. \nAccordingly, the Court understands the Assistant Chief to be\nasserting qualified immunity only as plaintiffs’ claims dealing\ndirectly with the Pershing Park arrests.   See Newsham Mot. to\nDismiss in 03-767 at 2 (“Assistant Chief Newsham ordered the\narrest at Pershing Park, but he had no involvement nor\nresponsibility or control over the circumstances under which\nplaintiffs were detained after they were arrested . . .thus, this\nmotion addresses only those portions of the Amended Complaint\nwhich pertain to Assitant Chief Newsham.”).\n15\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 16 of 53\nthe protestors would engage in violence if they were permitted to\nleave the Park.  \nDespite the fact that the official charge levied against the\nplaintiffs was “failure to obey,” Assistant Chief Newsham argues\nthat the asserted probable cause to arrest plaintiffs was not\nbased on plaintiffs’ refusal to obey a dispersal order, but\nrather was established by his knowledge of the protestors’ prior\nunlawful activity.   Specifically, Newsham states that he was\naware, through personal observation and other officers’ reports,\nthat\n1. no parade permits had been issued, and thus any\nstreet demonstrations were per se unlawful;\n2. demonstrators were disregarding officers’\ninstructions to move from the street to the\nsidewalks;\n3. demonstrators were marching in the streets and\nimpeding traffic;\n4. demonstrators had knocked over trash containers and\nnewspaper vending machines, and that at least one\nwindow had been smashed; and \n5. demonstrators had engaged in a “Sleeping Dragon”\nprotest maneuver, where they had chained themselves\ntogether so police could not remove them\nindividually. \nNewsham Statement of Material Facts in 03-767 ¶¶ 37-43. \nAssistant Chief Newsham argues that this alleged illegal\nactivity, coupled with his knowledge that MPD had received\nintelligence information that groups of protestors had declared\nan intention to “shut down the city,” established independent\n16\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 17 of 53\nprobable cause for arrest.  Newsham Mot. in 03-767 at 15. \nFinally, Assistant Chief Newsham states he believed the\ndemonstrators “were continuing to act as an organized group and\nwould at some point leave the park to continue their unlawful\ndemonstrations in the streets.”  Newsham Statement of Material\nFacts in 02-2283 ¶ 48.  Newsham argues he \nbelieved  that  if  the  demonstrators  were  allowed  to\nleave  Pershing  Park,  they  would  continue  their\nunlawful,  destructive  behavior,  and  if  they  did  so,\nparticularly  in  a  major  traffic  artery  or  if  they\napproached  the  vicinity  of  the  White  House,  MPD\nOfficers would be required to make arrests of roving\nbands of demonstrators in the streets, thus increasing\nthe likelihood of violence and injury to the police, to\ndemonstrators and to passerby.  \nId. ¶ 50.  Assistant Chief Newsham concludes that because he had\nprobable cause to believe the protestors had already committed\nunlawful acts, and because the decision to order the mass arrest\nin Pershing Park was also an attempt to prevent possible future\nviolence, he was under no obligation to issue a warning to\ndisperse and allow the protestors an opportunity to do so before\nordering the mass arrest.  Accordingly, Assistant Chief Newsham\nasserts that he is immune from any personal liability for the\nmass arrest. \nThe Court is not persuaded by Assistant Chief Newsham’s\narguments.  As an initial matter, the Court notes that the\narrested protestors were charged with “failure to obey.”  Not a\n17\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 18 of 53\nsingle arrestee was charged with any of the offenses that\nAssistant Chief Newsham avers established the probable cause to\nlawfully effect the mass arrest.  Tr. 4/6/04 at 79 (Newsham’s\ncounsel admitting none of the plaintiffs were criminally charged\nfor any activity prior to entering the Park); Id. at 85\n(Newsham’s counsel stating the protestors “were not doing\nanything illegal in the Park in and of itself”).  Indeed,\nAssistant Chief Newsham expressly admits he was unable to\nidentify specific people who had allegedly committed this\ncriminal conduct, but could only identify “groups” of people. \nId. at 86 (Newsham’s counsel agreeing with the Court that\nNewsham “could not identify any individuals in that group as\nbeing individuals whom he had observed committing criminal\nactivity before they arrived at Pershing Park”).  It is thus not\neven clear that these prior violations actually occurred, or\nwould have formed the basis for arrest.  Moreover, given that\ndefendants concede that an order to disperse was not given, the\n“failure to obey” charge is nothing short of ludicrous: the\narrest for “failure to obey” was clearly made without probable\ncause, or factual predicate, as there simply was no order to\n“obey.” \nIt is thus clear that there was not a legitimate basis to\narrest each individual in Pershing Park.  Assistant Chief\n18\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 19 of 53\nNewsham’s belief that some protestors may have earlier broken\nlaws does not justify a mass arrest of an entire group of lawful\nprotestors, as a \nperson's  mere  propinquity  to  others  independently\nsuspected  of  criminal  activity  does  not,  without\nmore, give rise to probable cause [as to that person]\n.  .  .  seizure  of  a  person  must  be  supported  by\nprobable  cause  particularized  with  respect  to  that\nperson.    This  requirement  cannot  be  undercut  or\navoided  by  simply  pointing  to  the  fact  that\ncoincidentally there exists probable cause to search\nor seize another or to search the premises where the\nperson may happen to be.\nMaryland v. Pringle, 124 S.Ct. 795, 801 (2003) (internal\ncitation and quotation omitted).4   As plaintiffs aptly state,\nDellums establishes a “bright line rule” that “where a group\ncontains persons who have not been violent or obstructive,\npolice may not mass arrest the demonstration as a group without\nfair warning or notice and the opportunity to come into\ncompliance and disperse.”  Pls.’ Opp. to Ramsey and Williams\nMot. to Dismiss in 02-2283 at 10.  It is undisputed that no\norder to disperse was given before the Park was cordoned off and\nthe mass arrest initiated.  This failure to give the\nprotestors–-who were essentially trapped in the Park--fair\n4  The Supreme Court did find that probable cause existed in\nPringle, but was careful to distinguish that case from a long-\nline of cases foreclosing probable cause based on guilt by\nassociation.\n  \n19\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 20 of 53\nwarning and an actual chance to disperse is fatal.  See Tr.\n4/6/04 at 18 (Chief Ramsey’s counsel agreeing with the Court\nthat protestors could not leave the Park, as there was “no way\nto get out of [the] cordoned off area”).  \nThe Dellums Court found the police chief’s failure to make\nsure his dispersal orders were actually heard, not merely given,\nrendered the mass arrest illegal.  Dellums, 566 F.2d at 183.  \nHere, it is uncontroverted that Assistant Chief Newsham didn’t\neven attempt to give a dispersal order, thus rendering the\narrests in flat conflict with the clearly established parameters\nof Dellums.  It is not the arrests per se, but his failure to\ngive an order reasonably calculated to give notice of the need \nto disperse before ordering the arrests, that renders the\narrests constitutionally infirm.5   \nThus, it is clear that the mass arrest in Pershing Park ran\n5 Assistant Chief Newsham’s statement that he “believed that any\nindividuals in the Park who were not part of the unlawful\ndemonstration had ample opportunity to leave and had done so”\ndoes not cure his failure to give a dispersal order, and is\nbelied by the facts that (1) the Park was cordoned off, thus\nmaking exit impossible, and (2) the MPD’s after-action report\nfound that individuals who were not part of the demonstration\nwere indeed arrested.  Newsham Statement of Material Facts in 02-\n2283 ¶ 55.  “[T]he ‘fair notice’ required . . . is notice\nreasonably likely to have reached all of the crowd.”  Dellums,\n566 F.2d at 181 n. 31 (emphasis added).  Clearly, Assistant Chief\nNewsham’s “belief” that the crowd could have dispersed, without\nactually giving a warning to disperse, did not put the crowd,\nincluding mere bystanders, on notice of any need to disperse. \n20\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 21 of 53\nafoul of the First and Fourth Amendment constitutional\nprotections established in Dellums.  Proceeding to the next step\nof the qualified immunity inquiry, the Court concludes that\nAssistant Chief Newsham is not shielded by a veil of qualified\nimmunity for this constitutional violation.  In light of clearly\nestablished law predicated on almost identical factual \ncircumstances, his actions cannot be considered those of a\nreasonable police officer.\nFirst, the binding authority in this Circuit, coupled with\nMPD Guidelines, defines the law at issue as “clearly\nestablished,” and charges Assistant Chief Newsham with notice\nof, and adherence to, that law.  In light of Dellums, no\n“reasonable officer could claim to be unaware” of the need to\ngive a warning to disperse before arresting a crowd of lawful\nprotestors.  Groh, 124 S.Ct at 1294.  The situation Assistant\nChief Newsham encountered in Pershing Park falls squarely into\nthe Dellums scenario: when faced with a crowd of demonstrators\nwho were not as a whole violent or destructive, police officers\nmust provide the crowd with a notice to disperse before\ncommencing a mass arrest.  Dellums, 566 F.2d at 183.  There\nsimply isn’t any ambiguity as to the established law.   \nMoreover, the MPD Manual for Mass Demonstrations requires\nseveral stages of warnings before a mass arrest order can be\n21\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 22 of 53\ngiven, and clearly states that mass arrest is authorized only \nif,  after  a  reasonable  amount  of  time  following  the\ninitial warnings, the crowd refuses to disperse, the\nunit commander . . . enter[s] a final warning ordering\nthe participators to disperse or  be subject to arrest\n. . . if after a reasonable amount of time following\nthe final warning, the crowd continues in its refusal\nto disperse, the unit commander shall direct that the\nviolators be arrested.\nMPD Manual on Mass Demonstrations at 21 (emphasis added); see\nalso Newsham Statement of Material Facts in 02-2283 ¶ 36\n(admitting knowledge of Chief Ramsey’s instructions that\ndemonstrators should be accommodated and minor violations of the\nlaw would be permitted in order to facilitate First Amendment\nexpression);  Groh, 124 S.Ct at 1294 (department guidelines can\nplace defendant on notice of potential personal liability).   \nFinally, it is most significant that other officials on the\nscene, witnessing the same events and applying the same clearly\nsettled law, decided that a mass arrest was not warranted.  For\nexample, the United States Park Police, who have the authority\nto issue demonstration permits in the Park, refused to arrest\nanyone for demonstrating without a permit.  See Major Richard\nMurphy Decl. ¶ 44 (“I explained [to Newsham] . . . that while no\ngroup had a Park Service permit for the Park, that the Park\nPolice would make no arrests, explaining that . . . our Park\nPolice procedure was to first warn individuals that they were in\n22\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 23 of 53\nviolation and allow them to come into voluntary compliance.”)\n(emphasis added).  CDU Coordinator Lieutenant Jeffrey Herold\nalso advised command officials on the scene at Pershing Park\nthat they should not effectuate a mass arrest because he “could\nnot see how they established probable cause,” and also\nrecommended alternatives to mass arrest.  See Herold Depo. at\n333-34, 335.  Thus, any argument that other officers in the same\nposition would have also ordered the mass arrest falls flat, as\nother officers actually on the scene concluded that ordering a\nmass arrest without first giving an order to disperse was not\nlawful.\nHere, as noted above, individualized probable cause to\narrest each individual was not established, as Assistant Chief\nNewsham did not witness each arrestee commit an arrestable\noffense.  Absent a dispersal order and an opportunity to\ndisperse, a mass arrest of lawful protestors without a prior\ndispersal order is constitutionally infirm.6 \n Assistant Chief Newsham’s order for a mass arrest made\n6 Moreover, Assistant Chief Newsham’s assertion that the gathering\nin Pershing Park was per se illegal because the protestors were\nthere without a permit is belied by Newsham’s counsel’s express\nstatement that the protestors “were not doing anything illegal in\nthe Park in and of itself.”  Tr. 4/6/04 at 85.  Thus, even if the\ncrowd was demonstrating without a permit, Newsham had an\nobligation to give a dispersal warning and order before\ncommencing the mass arrests.  \n23\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 24 of 53\nwithout a previous order to disperse violated clearly\nestablished law and was not objectively reasonable. \nAccordingly, his claim of qualified immunity as to personal\nliability for the Pershing Park arrests is denied.\n2. Chief Ramsey’s Immunity Claims for Arrests in Pershing\nPark in Civil Action 02-2283 and Civil Action 03-767\nFor the reasons stated supra, the Court finds the mass\narrest in Pershing Park ran afoul of the clearly established\nconstitutional protections enunciated in Dellums.  Indeed,\nduring the April 6, 2004, Motions Hearing, Chief Ramsey’s \ncounsel admitted that the arrests could not be justified as\nconstitutional, and that a dispersal order should have been\ngiven.  See Tr. 4/6/04 at 24.  Thus, as essentially conceded by\nChief Ramsey, the only question as to Chief Ramsey’s possible\npersonal liability for the mass arrest is whether he acted in an\nobjectively reasonable manner.  The crux of Chief Ramsey’s\nargument is that his approval of the mass arrest was reasonable\nbecause he was unaware that an order to disperse had not been\ngiven prior to the commencement of arrests.\nPlaintiffs argue that because Chief Ramsey was on the scene\nprior to the arrests, and conferring with Assistant Chief\nNewsham, Chief Ramsey participated in and approved the mass\narrest conducted in clear violation of Dellums, and thus can be\n24\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 25 of 53\nheld personally liable for the resultant constitutional\nviolations.   Indeed, Chief Ramsey candidly admits that he\narrived at Pershing Park before the arrests began.  “By the time\nthat Chief Ramsey . . . arrived, Newsham had already decided to\narrest the persons who had collected in Pershing Park . . .\nNewsham was awaiting the arrival of buses to transport those\nindividuals to arrest processing sites once the arrests had been\neffected before he directed the arrest process to be commenced.”\nRamsey Mot. for Summ. J. in 03-767 at 7.  Ramsey also states\nthat he “believed, based upon the conversation that he . . . had\nwith Newsham, that probable cause existed to support the arrests\nof the persons in Pershing Park.”  Ramsey Statement of Material\nFacts in 03-767 ¶ 38.  He further admits that “Newsham ordered\nthe arrests of the persons in Pershing Park, correctly believing\nthat, based upon what he advised Chief Ramsey in their\nconversation, Chief Ramsey tacitly approved Newsham’s decision. \nBased on information that Chief Ramsey had received, Chief\nRamsey did not countermand Newsham’s decision and order.” \nWilliams and Ramsey Statement of Material Facts in 02-2283 ¶ 38\n(emphasis added).  It is thus clear that Chief Ramsey approved\nthe arrests before they occurred.\n If Chief Ramsey knew that a dispersal order had not been\ngiven, his immunity defense obviously fails for the same reasons\n25\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 26 of 53\narticulated in the discussion of Assistant Chief Newsham’s\nimmunity.  It is unclear, however, whether Chief Ramsey was\naware that the crowd had not been ordered to disperse.  Chief\nRamsey’s original sworn statement claims that when he arrived at\nthe Park, Assistant Chief Newsham “explained . . . he believed\nthat he had probable cause to arrest persons who had entered the\nPark at the time they arrived in the park, based on offenses\nthey had committed before entering Pershing Park, without\nordering them to disperse and awaiting their response.”  Ramsey\nDecl. 10/13/03 ¶¶ 17-19 (emphasis added).  However, Chief Ramsey\nalso claims that he “did not realize, at that point, that the\npark had not, in fact, been cleared of people before it came to\nbe a holding area . . . or that orders to disperse had not been\ngiven to the crowd.”  Williams and Ramsey Statement of Material\nFacts in 02-2283 ¶ 39 (emphasis added).  During oral argument,\ncounsel stated that Chief Ramsey was not aware of the failure to\ngive an order to disperse.  Thus, the existence of this factual\ndispute on such a central issue–-Ramsey’s knowledge or lack\nthereof that a dispersal order had not been given-–could itself\npreclude summary judgment on the qualified immunity issue.\nMoreover, even assuming arguendo that Chief Ramsey was\nunaware that a dispersal order had not been given prior to the\narrest, this simply begs the question of why Chief Ramsey did\n26\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 27 of 53\nnot ask whether the order had been given prior to approving the\narrest.  Chief Ramsey fully admits he had an opportunity to\nconfer with Assistant Chief Newsham prior to the arrest, and\nonly after this conferral did he approve the mass arrest.  See\nTr. 4/6/04 at 9 (Ramsey’s counsel stating “there was a\nconsultation between Assistant Chief Newsham and the Chief in\nwhich the decision to arrest was, in fact, approved”).  It is\nquite clear to the Court that a reasonable police chief, coming\nupon the scene of 400 people exercising their First Amendment\nrights to engage in protest activities and not currently\nengaging in any illegal behavior, would recognize the need--and\nindeed the duty--to ask a subordinate officer whether a\ndispersal order had been given prior to ratifying a mass arrest. \nSee Tr. 4/6/04 at 20-21 (Ramsey’s counsel stating “nothing has\nbeen suggested . . . that criminal conduct arising in an arrest”\nwas taking place in Pershing Park when Chief Ramsey arrived).  \nA police officer, and especially a seasoned police chief in the\nNation’s Capital, has a duty to pursue “reasonable avenues of\ninvestigation” before interfering with the exercise of First\nAmendment freedoms, “especially when . . . it is unclear whether\na crime had even taken place.”  Be Vier v. Hucal, 806 F.2d 123,\n127 (7th Cir. 1986)(denying qualified immunity where police\nofficer had failed to make reasonable inquiries before making\n27\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 28 of 53\narrest).  Given the admitted dearth of illegal activity\noccurring in the Park, Chief Ramsey had a duty to inquire as to\nthe circumstances surrounding and justifying the mass arrest. \nChief Ramsey’s reliance on Assistant Chief Newsham’s on-\nscene report does not excuse Chief Ramsey’s approval of unlawful\narrests, and does not rise to the level of investigation that\nthe Pershing Park situation warranted.  \nAlthough  a  police  officer  is  entitled  to  rely  on\ninformation  obtained  from  fellow  law  enforcement\nofficers  .  .  .  this  in  no  way  negates  a  police\nofficer's  duty  to  reasonably  inquire  or  investigate\nthese  reported  facts.    We  have  denied  qualified\nimmunity  to  police    officers  who  had  indisputably\nrelied  on  information  obtained  from  other  law\nenforcement  officials,  when  we  concluded  that  they\nviolated their duty to conduct further investigation.\nMendocino Environmental Center v. Mendocino County, 192 F.3d\n1283, 1293 n.16 (9th Cir. 1999) (emphasis added).  Thus, even if\nChief Ramsey did not have knowledge of Assistant Chief Newsham’s\nfailure to give the dispersal order, it was patently\nunreasonable for him to approve the arrest without asking\nessential questions--the most essential being whether an order\nto disperse had been given.  It is similarly unreasonable, in\nview of Dellums and clearly established MPD policies, for the\nChief to accept Assistant Chief Newsham’s assertions that there\nwas probable cause for arrest as to every person in the Park. \n28\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 29 of 53\nQuite simply, a police chief in Chief Ramsey’s position could\nnot reasonably assume, absent probing inquiry, that all 400\nindividuals in the Park had independently engaged in illegal\nbehavior.  See Herold Depo. at 333-34, 335 (there was not\nprobable cause to arrest entire crowd); Tr. 4/6/04 at 20-21 (no\nillegal activity was occurring in the Park); see also Be Vier,\n806 F.2d at 127 (“A police officer may not close her or his eyes\nto facts that would help clarify the circumstances of an\narrest.”).7 \nFinally, plaintiffs argue that Chief Ramsey violated his\nduty to supervise the Assistant Chief and his subordinates.  \nThe most recent Circuit case on the issue of supervisorial\nliability, International Action Center v. U.S., draws a sharp\ndistinction between supervisorial liability for direct action\nand liability for inaction.  365 F.3d 20 (D.C. Cir. 2004).\nInternational Action Center makes clear that supervisorial\nliability cannot be grounded on a theory of “general inaction.” \nA supervisor who merely fails to detect and prevent a\nsubordinate’s misconduct . . . cannot be liable for\n7 At the April 6, 2004, Motions Hearing, defense counsel relied\nheavily on Chief Ramsey’s issuance of a post-arrest official\nreprimand to Assistant Chief Newsham–-reprimanding Assistant\nChief Newsham for “the failure to give warnings to disperse”--as\nevidence that Chief Ramsey did not approve the arrests.  However,\nthe after-the-fact reprimand does not cure the failure to ask the\nquestions that a reasonable police chief on the scene must ask-\n–namely, if an order to disperse had been given.\n29\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 30 of 53\nthat misconduct.  The supervisor must know about the\nconduct and facilitate it, approve it, condone it, or\nturn a blind eye for fear of what they might see.\nId. at 28 (internal citation and quotation omitted).  \nChief Ramsey’s performance at Pershing Park is precisely\nthe active participation capable of rendering a supervisor\npersonally liable for constitutional violations.   At worst,\nChief Ramsey knew the dispersal order had not been given and\nthus deliberately flaunted existing law and MPD policies; at\nbest, he turned a “blind eye” to the situation and refused to\nask the questions necessary to ascertain whether arrests were\nconstitutionally permitted.  Chief Ramsey was actually on the\nscene before and when the arrests occurred, had the opportunity\nto confer with his subordinate, and approved the decision to\norder the arrests.  He is thus just as liable for the resulting\nconstitutional violations as Assistant Chief Newsham.8  See\n8  Plaintiffs further argue that in addition to direct\nparticipation in the arrests, Chief Ramsey can also be personally\nliable for his ratification of the unconstitutional mass arrests.\nPlaintiffs state that Ramsey ratified the arrests by (1) his\ndirect participation; (2) his rejection of arrestees’ complaints\neven as they sought to leave; (3) his express approval of the\nmass arrests at the September 27, 2002, press conference; (4) his\ncomments in late September that he “offer[ed] no excuses, and no\napologies” for the arrests and rated the MPD’s actions as “A\nplus;” and (5) his April 29, 2003, testimony to the D.C. Council\nthat the MPD does “a very good job dealing with” mass\ndemonstrations. See Pls.’ Opp. to Ramsey and Williams Mot. to\nDismiss in 02-2283 at 20 (citing and quoting press articles). \nHowever, given that the Court concludes that Chief Ramsey\n30\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 31 of 53\nHaynesworth v. Miller, 820 F.2d 1245, 1262 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (“in\norder to find a supervisory official personally liable in\ndamages for the unconstitutional acts of his subordinate, it\nmust be shown that he was responsible for supervising the\nwrongdoer; that a duty to instruct the subordinate to prevent\nconstitutional harm arose from the surrounding circumstances;\nand that, as a result of the official's failure to instruct, the\nplaintiff was harmed in the manner threatened.”); see also Leary\nv. Daeschner, 349 F.3d 888, 903 (6th Cir. 2003) (supervisor\nliability under § 1983 is appropriate when \"the supervisor\nencouraged the specific incident of misconduct or in some other\nway directly participated in it,\" or \"at least implicitly\nauthorized, approved or knowingly acquiesced in the\nunconstitutional conduct of the offending subordinate\")\n(emphasis added).  Accordingly, for any or all of the reasons\nstated above, Chief Ramsey’s motion for qualified immunity as to\nthe Pershing Park arrests is denied.\ndestroyed his immunity for the arrest through direct\nparticipation, the Court need not reach this indirect\nparticipation issue.    \n   \n31\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 32 of 53\n \n3. Mayor Williams’s Immunity for Arrests in \nPershing Park in Civil Action 02-2283  \nPlaintiffs claim that Mayor Williams is also personally\nliable for the mass arrests based on a failure to instruct Chief\nRamsey and Assistant Chief Newsham “not to engage in mass\nunconstitutional arrests,” ratification of the arrests in media\ninterviews following the arrest, and allowance of a custom or\npractice of using mass arrests to terminate protests.   Mayor\nWilliams argues that he is entitled to summary judgment on all\nof plaintiffs’ § 1983 claims; the thrust of his qualified\nimmunity defense is that, even if plaintiffs did suffer a\nconstitutional harm at the hands of the MPD, he cannot be held\nvicariously liable for his subordinates’ actions.  In light of\nInternational Action Center, the Court agrees.\nPlaintiffs argue that Mayor Williams “subjected plaintiffs\nto an ongoing period of incarceration when on September 27,\n2002, he held a press conference to reap political benefit from\nthe Chief’s mass false arrests.  The Mayor, at that time, could\nhave taken measures to enforce the U.S. Constitution, to\nintervene against the Chief, to cease the incarceration of the\narrestees or to limit the damage done by demanding arrests cease\nand persons be released immediately.”  See Pls.’ Opp. to Ramsey\nand Williams Mot. to Dismiss in 02-2283 at 21.  Plaintiffs claim\n32\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 33 of 53\nthat Mayor Williams ratified the mass arrests during the\nSeptember 27th press conference, “at which he praised the\nexecution of the mass arrests as a proper balance between open\nexpression and public safety.”  Id. at 22.    \nIn light of International Action Center v. U.S.,  the case\nfor Mayor Williams’s personal liability is tenuous.  First, the\nMayor cannot be held liable for an active failure to supervise\non these specific facts, as, unlike Chief Ramsey, he was not on\nthe scene at the time of the arrest, was not consulted about the\nmass arrests before they occurred, and did not approve the\narrests before they occurred.  See International Action Center,\n365 F.3d at 26-28 (recognizing that there is a difference\nbetween supervisorial liability for inaction and supervisorial\nliability for active participation).\nAs to Mayor Williams’s liability for supervisorial inaction,\nplaintiffs allege that past protest-related mass arrests should\nhave prompted the Mayor to take proactive steps to prevent future\nmass arrests.  However, the bar for piercing the qualified\nimmunity shield on a theory of inaction in the face of knowledge\nof past transgressions is high, as a “supervisor who merely fails\nto detect and prevent a subordinate’s misconduct . . . cannot be\nliable for that misconduct.”  International Action Center, 365\nF.3d at 28.  As clearly stated in International Action Center,\n33\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 34 of 53\nsuch liability cannot simply be premised on a showing that the\nsupervisor had “knowledge of past transgressions.”  Id.  Rather,\nto defeat a supervisor’s assertion of qualified immunity,\nplaintiffs must “link the likelihood of particular constitutional\nviolations to any past transgressions,” and also link “particular\nsupervisors to past practices or any familiarity with them.”  Id.\nat 27.  Thus, plaintiffs must establish either that (1) Mayor\nWilliams authorized the allegedly unconstitutional mass arrests,\nor (2) Mayor Williams had reason to believe, prior to September\n27, 2002, that Assistant Chief Newsham and Chief Ramsey would\nengage in unconstitutional arrests.  This they have not done.\nFirst, Chief Ramsey has made clear that he knew Mayor\nWilliams would not authorize arrests without probable cause.\nWilliams and Ramsey Statement of Material Facts in 02-2283 ¶ 64. \nGiven that Mayor Williams was not on the scene of the arrests,\nand was not consulted prior to the arrests, any claims of mayoral\nauthorization are defeated.   As Mayor Williams argues, he is not\nkept apprised of the “complex and fluid details of mass\ndemonstration policing efforts,” and thus “does not possess the\nbasis necessary to ratify unconstitutional practices.”  Ramsey\nand Williams Mot. to Dismiss in 02-2283 at 33.  Absent evidence\nto the contrary, the Court accepts this representation.\nWhether the Mayor’s knowledge of a “history of past\n34\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 35 of 53\ntransgressions” creates a duty to act proactively to prevent\nunconstitutional mass arrests is admittedly a closer question. \nPls.’ Supplemental Brief in 02-2283 at 10.  Plaintiffs state that\nIMF/World Bank protestors were “subjected to almost identical\nmass false arrests” in April 2000, and cite to the extensive \npress coverage of the 2000 arrests, and comments made by Mayor\nWilliams after those arrests, as evidence that he was fully aware\nof this past practice.  Pls.’ Response at 28-30 (alleging that\nthe 2000 protestors, like the 2002 protestors, were arrested\nwithout prior notice to disperse, were prevented from leaving the\nprotest area, and were held overnight); Pls.’ Supplemental Brief\nin 02-2283 at 11-12.  Thus, plaintiffs conclude that the Mayor\nhas “steadfastly chosen to not take effective action to prevent\nthe continuation of this policy, practice or custom of which he\napproves.”  Pls.’ Supplemental Brief in 02-2283 at 14.\nHowever, the central question is whether the Mayor’s actual\nknowledge of these past practices established a sufficient link\nto the instant mass arrests so as to hold the Mayor liable for a\nfailure to prevent his subordinates from repeating the mass\narrest scenario.  Any personal liability cannot rest on the\nMayor’s knowledge of past events; plaintiffs also have to show\nthat Mayor Williams could have, and failed to, take steps to\nprevent the Pershing Park arrests.  \n35\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 36 of 53\n The record evidence demonstrates that at least minimal\nsteps to ensure protests would be permitted were indeed taken. \nIt is undisputed that during the weeks prior to September 27,\n2002, Chief Ramsey held meetings with the Assistant Chiefs and\ninstructed them that “arrests of demonstrators should be avoided\nif at all possible. His intent was to allow anyone who wanted to\nprotest or demonstrate to do so even if it meant overlooking some\nminor violations of the law that did not seriously threaten\npublic safety.”  Ramsey Statement of Material Facts in 03-767  ¶¶\n21, 23.  There is record evidence of supplemental officer\ntraining, evidence that the Chief knew the Mayor would not permit\nunconstitutional arrests, and evidence of a declared policy to\nallow minor violations of the law in order to facilitate First\nAmendment expression.   That the Mayor’s subordinates violated\nclearly established MPD policy and federal law does not remove\nthe Mayor’s personal liability shield, as it appears, based on\npre-protest preparations, that the Mayor had reason to believe\nhis subordinates would comply with federal law and MPD policies. \nSee International Action Center, 365 F.3d at 28 (where\nsupervisorial inaction is alleged plaintiffs must “establish a\nhigh degree of fault in order to implicate the supervisor in the\nconstitutional infractions of his subordinates”). \nFinally, plaintiffs’ claims that Mayor Williams ratified the\n36\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 37 of 53\narrests by speaking approvingly of the MPD during a subsequent\nnews conference also fall flat.  Mayor Williams persuasively\nargues it was not objectively unreasonable at the time for the\nMayor to comment on the actions of the Police Department, and\nthat public officials should not be precluded from public comment\nfor fear of imputed personal liability.  Further, once\nallegations of wrongdoing came to light following September 27,\n2002, Mayor Williams ordered an investigation of the Pershing\nPark arrests.  This resulted in the publication of a revised Mass\nDemonstration Manual in May 2003, and the issuance of an official\nreprimand to Assistant Chief Newsham.  Williams and Ramsey\nStatement of Material Facts in 02-2283 ¶¶ 59-61.\nAccordingly, given that Mayor Williams did not actively\nparticipate in the arrests, and recognizing the high bar for\nsupervisorial inaction liability established in International\nAction Center, the Court finds that Mayor Williams is not\npersonally liable for the Pershing Park arrests.\nB. Immunity for Arrests at Vermont and K Streets in Civil \nAction 02-2283 and Civil Action 03-767 \nBased on the forgoing discussion, the analysis as to the\n37\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 38 of 53\narrests at Vermont and K Streets is considerably more brief.9  \nAssistant Chief Brian Jordan, who is not a named defendant, was\nresponsible for the area surrounding Vermont and K Streets. \nJordan Decl. ¶ 2; Williams and Ramsey Statement of Material Facts\nin 02-2283 ¶ 53.  \nSimply stated, there is no record evidence that Chief Ramsey\nwas on the scene of Vermont and K Streets at the time of the\narrests, and the Court accepts Chief Ramsey’s assertion, through\ncounsel, that Chief Ramsey was not present.   Tr. 4/6/04 at 39. \nFurther, unlike the arrests in Pershing Park, there is no record\nevidence suggesting that Chief Ramsey in any way approved the\nVermont and K Streets arrests.   Given that Chief Ramsey did not\nactively participate in the arrests, he could only be held\npersonally liable on a theory of failure to supervise Assistant\nChief Jordan.  As discussed supra, however, a “supervisor who\nmerely fails to detect and prevent a subordinate’s misconduct . .\n. cannot be liable for that misconduct.”  International Action\nCenter, 365 F.3d at 28.   Chief Ramsey asserts, and it has not\n9  The Court has very little information regarding the arrests at\nVermont and K Streets, as the parties have devoted scant\nresources to the issue.  Indeed, the Abbate plaintiffs do not\neven mention the Vermont and K Street arrest in their Opposition\nto Chief Ramsey’s Motion for Summary Judgment; the Barham\nplaintiffs devote two paragraphs to Chief Ramsey’s potential\npersonal liability for those arrests. \n38\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 39 of 53\nbeen contradicted, that in the days leading up to the protests he\nrepeatedly conferred with his command staff, “expressed his\nintent to allow anyone who wanted to protest or demonstrate to do\nso even if it meant that the MPD had to overlook some minor\nviolations of the law,” and instructed the command staff to avoid\narrests of demonstrators “if at all possible.”  Ramsey Decl. ¶¶\n4-10.   While this prior instruction to his subordinates does not\nsave Chief Ramsey as to the Pershing Park arrests, as he actively\nparticipated in and approved the arrests, this prior instruction\ndoes protect Chief Ramsey from personal liability for\nsupervisorial inaction as to Assistant Chief Jordan’s actions at\nVermont and K Streets. \nFinally, the preceding discussion of Mayor Williams’s\nliability for the Pershing Park arrests applies with equal force\nto his liability for the Vermont and K Streets arrests; Mayor\nWilliams cannot be held personally liable on a supervisorial\ninaction theory for violations arising from the Vermont and K\nStreets arrests. \n \nC.  Conditions of Confinement/Excessive Force Claims in \nCivil Action 02-2283 and Civil Action 03-767\nThe first step in every qualified immunity analysis is to\ndetermine whether a constitutional violation has occurred.  The\n39\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 40 of 53\nCourt finds that plaintiffs are unable to establish that\ndefendants’ actions, specifically the use of flexi-cuffs during\nplaintiffs’ arrests, constituted excessive force, and thus\nconcludes that no constitutional violation capable of destroying\nthe qualified immunity shield occurred.   \n Two types of excessive force claims are at issue.  See Tr.\n4/6/04 at 98-99.  First, the Barham plaintiffs assert excessive\nforce allegations primarily as an element of their false arrest\nclaims.  Id. at 98.  In other words, the Barham plaintiffs’\nexcessive force claims are based on the alleged injury suffered\nas a result of the level of force used in effectuating an\nunlawful arrest.  In contrast, the Abbate plaintiffs challenge\nthe use of force during the arrests and the “practice of the so-\ncalled wrist to ankle handcuffing or flexi-cuffing which occurred\nfor those people who were detained at the police academy . . .\nwhether or not it is also an element of false arrest damages.” \nId. at 99.  The Abbate plaintiffs allege that the level of force\nused during their post-arrest detention was excessive.  See id.\nat 92, 98-99, 102-05.  Under either concept of excessive force,\nplaintiffs cannot succeed.\n1.  Use of Force During the Arrests\nIn Graham v. Connor, the Supreme Court established “that\nall claims that law enforcement officers have used excessive\n40\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 41 of 53\nforce . . . in the course of arrest . . . should be analyzed\nunder the Fourth Amendment and its ‘reasonableness’ standard,\nrather than under a ‘substantive due process’ approach.”  490\nU.S. 386, 395 (1989) (emphasis in original).  The Graham approach\nhas been expressly adopted by the D.C. Circuit.  See, e.g.,\nRogala v. District of Columbia, 161 F.3d 44, 54 (D.C. Cir. 1999);\nDeGraff v. District of Columbia, 120 F.3d 298, 301-02 (D.C. Cir.\n1997).   However, whether a specific action during an arrest\nconstitutes a “reasonable” use of force remains a murky question.\nDetermining the “reasonableness” or “excessiveness” of a\nspecific level of force during an arrest requires “careful\nattention to the facts and circumstances of each particular\ncase,” with the ultimate question being “whether the officers’\nactions are ‘objectively reasonable’ in light of the facts and\ncircumstances confronting them, without regard to their\nunderlying intent or motivation.”  Graham, 490 U.S. at 396-97.  \nIn conducting its analysis, the Court will look to “the severity\nof the crime at issue, whether the suspect poses an immediate\nthreat to the safety of the officers or others, and whether he is\nactively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by\nflight.”  Id. at 396 (emphasis added).  \nThe reasonableness of the level of force employed must be\njudged, ex ante, from the perspective of the officer on the\n41\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 42 of 53\nscene, “rather than [through] the 20/20 vision of hindsight.” \nId.  It is clear that “[n]ot every push or shove, even if it may\nlater seem unnecessary in the peace of a judge’s chambers,\nviolates the Fourth Amendment.”  Id. at 396 (internal citations\nomitted).  Furthermore, any determination of “reasonableness”\nmust account for the “split-second judgments” often required in\nlaw enforcement.  Id. at 397. \nAs a result, few bright line rules exist as to what\nconstitutes excessive force during an arrest.  In the present\ncase, the Court is asked to determine whether the MPD’s use of\n“flexi-cuffs” to restrain plaintiffs (and other arrestees) during\narrest amounted to excessive force.  The D.C. Circuit has never\naddressed the question of when “flexi-cuffing” amounts to\nexcessive force, and little guidance is provided by the other\ncircuits.  Several circuits have recognized that applying\nhandcuffs too tightly may constitute excessive force.  See, e.g.,\nBastien v. Goddard, 279 F.3d 10 (1st Cir. 2002); Kostrzewa v.\nCity of Troy, 247 F.3d 633, 640 (6th Cir. 2001).  However, other\ncourts have held that handcuffing too tightly, without other\nactions, does not amount to excessive force.   See Rodriguez v.\nFarrell, 294 F.3d 1276 (11th Cir. 2002) (holding an officer’s\nrefusal to adjust the handcuffs on a complaining suspect does not\nnecessarily constitute excessive force); Glenn v. City of Tyler,\n42\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 43 of 53\n242 F.3d 307 (5th Cir. 2001) (handcuffing alone is not excessive\nforce).\nIn sum, the guidelines necessary to decide whether the use\nof handcuffs (or flexi-cuffs) during an arrest may constitute\nexcessive force remain undefined in the D.C. Circuit and\ngenerally inconsistent across its sister circuits.  This lack of\nclearly established law is relevant both to determining the\n“reasonableness” of an officer’s actions and whether the officer\nis entitled to qualified immunity.  Plaintiffs have provided no\nevidence to demonstrate the level of force utilized during their\narrestexcessive.  The arrestees were handcuffed in standard\nfashion and transported to a makeshift holding facility at the\nPolice Academy.  See Tr. 4/6/04 at 101-05.  There have been no\nallegations that the manner in which plaintiffs were handcuffed\nat the time of arrest was unique or abnormally oppressive.   \nAccordingly, the Court finds that it is unlikely that the\nuse of flexi-cuffs during the arrest, without more, amounts to a\nconstitutional violation.  It is undoubtedly reasonable to\nhandcuff arrestees during a mass arrest, especially when they are\nbeing transported via an unsecured bus to a holding facility. \nMoreover, due to the lack of clearly established law in this\nCircuit or other circuits, the Court cannot find that it would\n“be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful\n43\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 44 of 53\nin the situation he confronted.”  Groh v. Ramirez, 124 S.Ct 1284,\n1293 (2004) (quoting Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 202 (2001)). \nAbsent clearly established law, defendants cannot be held\npersonally liable for the excessive force claims.\n 2. Use of Force During Detention\nPlaintiffs argue that the use of flexi-cuffs during\ndetention, cuffing one wrist to the opposite ankle, violated\nclearly established law prohibiting the use of excessive force. \nThey argue that “handcuffing unresisting plaintiffs, who were\nalready confined in the Police Academy Gymnasium, wrist to ankle\nfor an extended period of time was . . . grossly excessive and\ninjurious . . . .”  Pls.’ Opp. to Ramsey’s Motion to Dismiss in\n03-767 at 17.  Plaintiffs cite De Graff v. District of Columbia\nas the “clearly established law” on the Fourth Amendment and\nexcessive force, and relied heavily on this case at oral\nargument.  In DeGraff, the Circuit reversed and remanded the\nlower court’s decision that police officers who had handcuffed a\nwoman, carried her horizontally for some distance, and then\nhandcuffed her to a mailbox were immune from liability.  Noting\nthe limited record before the Court, but also warning that “it\nwould be hard to justify their actions,” the Court remanded for\nfurther development of the record.  120 F. 3d 298, 302 (D.C. Cir.\n1997). \n44\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 45 of 53\nHowever, De Graff makes clear that “police officers will\nnot be found to have used excessive force in violation of the\nFourth Amendment if their actions were 'objectively reasonable'\nin light of the facts and circumstances confronting them, without\nregard to their underlying intent or motivation.”  Id. at 302\n(noting force has been considered appropriate with an “evasive\nsuspect,” or “escaping prisoner” and when officers fear for their\nsafety) (internal citation and quotation omitted).  Here, the use\nof flexi-cuffs by officers facing a crowd of several hundred\nprotestors is not analogous to handcuffing a woman, forcibly\ncarrying her horizontally, and then cuffing her to a mailbox.  \nFurther, the Supreme Court has noted that an excessive force\ndue process analysis turns on whether the force used amounts to\n“punishment:”\nA court must decide whether the disability is imposed\nfor the purpose of punishment or whether it is but an\nincident of some other legitimate governmental purpose.\nAbsent a showing of an expressed intent to punish on\nthe  part  of  detention  facility    officials,  that\ndetermination  generally  will  turn  on  whether  an\nalternative  purpose  to  which  [the  restriction]  may\nrationally  be  connected  is  assignable  for  it,  and\nwhether  it  appears  excessive  in  relation  to  the\nalternative purpose assigned [to it].\nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 538-39 (1979) (internal citation\nand quotation omitted).   At oral argument on April 6, 2004, \nplaintiffs argued that it was not simply the use of flexi-cuffs,\n45\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 46 of 53\nbut the period of time and the manner in which they were used\n(cuffing wrist to opposite ankle) that rendered the use\nexcessive.  They further argued that, given that the arrestees\nwere in a confined area–-an area designated for people who were\ncooperating with police–-and not appearing to pose a risk of\nviolence or flight, the use of flexi-cuffs was not warranted.\nDefendants Ramsey and Williams counter that “the use of\nflexi-cuffs was reasonably related to the legitimate government\ninterest of maintaining the safety of the arrestees and the MPD\nprocessing personnel,” and that a reasonable officer in the same\nposition would have deemed the use of flexi-cuffs necessary, or\nat the least not constitutionally impermissible.  See Ramsey\nReply Mem. in 03-767 at 15.  Defendants argue that the flexi-cuff\nrestraints were used to (1) protect the safety of the detainees,\nofficers, and guards, (2) prevent inappropriate\n“fraternization”10 among the detainees, (3) prevent damage to\n10 At oral argument, defendants asserted the use of flexi-cuffs\nmet a need to prevent “fraternization” or “mass fornication”\namong the arrestees.  As the Court made abundantly clear during \noral argument, this rationale is flatly ridiculous, and the Court\nlends it no credit.  Moreover, the Court sharply emphasizes that\nit does not accept this rationale as legitimate or as justifying\nthe use of flexi-cuffs.  See Tr. 6/14/04 at 16-21.  Indeed, had\nthis been the only rationale offered for the use of flexi-cuffs,\nthe Court would find a constitutional violation had occurred, and\nwould likely conclude that defendants face personal liability for\nthat violation.   Defendants have saved themselves, however, by\nwisely choosing to rely more heavily on arguments that flexi-\ncuffs were needed for protection and to prevent arrestee escape\n46\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 47 of 53\nproperty, and (4) prevent escape (given that the detainees were\nheld in an open gymnasium rather than secured cells).  See Tr.\n4/6/04 at 118-25.  \nThe use of flexi-cuffs, without more, does not, under the\ncircumstances of mass arrest, reach the level of excessive force.\nHere, the officers had a legitimate need to control a large group\nof people.  “[I]f a particular condition or restriction of\npretrial detention is reasonably related to a legitimate\ngovernmental objective, it does not, without more, amount to\npunishment.”  Bell, 441 U.S. at 538-39.  Putting aside the absurd\nfraternization/fornication argument, the use of flexi-cuff\nrestraints is reasonably likely to serve the stated goals. \nIndeed, Bell specifically concludes that the government has\n“legitimate interests that stem from its need to manage the\nfacility in which the individual is detained,” including the need\nto “maintain security and order at the institution.”  Bell, 441\nU.S. at 540. \nDefendants Ramsey and Williams have supported the decision\nto use flexi-cuffs, and the Court concludes that reasonable\nofficials in the same position could have made the same decision. \nAccordingly, the Court finds that Chief Ramsey and Mayor Williams\nare not personally liable on the excessive force claims. \nfrom an unsecured area.\n47\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 48 of 53\nD.  Length of Detention Claims in Civil Action 02-2283 \nand Civil Action 03-767 as to Defendant Ramsey and \nDefendant Williams\nBoth the Abbate and Barham plaintiffs assert that their\nrights to due process and equal protection were violated by\nextended detention and the unavailability of citation and/or post\nand trial release.  More specifically, the Abbate plaintiffs\nargue that Chief Ramsey “had a clearly established duty to\nrelease Plaintiffs from custody because he knew, while the\nplaintiffs were waiting to be loaded onto busses at Pershing\nPark, that they had been falsely arrested.”  Pls.’ Opp. to Def.\nRamsey’s Mot. for Summ. J. in 03-767 at 18.   The Barham\nplaintiffs center their extended detention claim on allegations\nthat “persons caught in targeted mass political sweeps” are\ndenied access to citation release and post and trial release. \nThe Barham plaintiffs argue that the post and trial option\n“allows an arrestee to be quickly released from jail or custody\nby posting collateral and receiving a trial date on which to\nchallenge the legality of the arrest,” whereas the post and\nforfeit option allows an arrestee early release but does not\nallow her the opportunity to challenge the legality of the\narrest.  Am. Compl. in 02-2283 ¶ 10.  The Barham plaintiffs\n48\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 49 of 53\nconclude that this amounts to “disparate treatment”–-apparently\non a theory that non-protestors have access to citation and/or\npost and trial release-–and denies protestors equal protection\nunder the law.  Mayor Williams and Chief Ramsey claim they are\nimmune from personal liability on plaintiffs’ extended detention\nclaims. \nAs an initial matter, the Abbate plaintiffs’ mere\ncontention that Chief Ramsey “knew” the arrests were invalid is\nnot enough to defeat Chief Ramsey’s motion for summary judgment\non the extended detention claims.  While the Court agrees that\nthe arrest itself violated clearly established constitutional\nrights, and that Chief Ramsey faces personal liability for that\narrest, this does not automatically compel the conclusion that\nChief Ramsey later violated a constitutional duty to release the\narrestees. \nRather, the analysis of the constitutionality of the arrest\nand the analysis of whether a later duty to release arose are\ndistinct.  A duty to release only arises where an officer\n“actually does ascertain beyond reasonable doubt that one who has\nbeen . . .  arrested” should not have been due to lack of\nprobable cause.  See McConney v. City of Houston, 863 F.2d 1180,\n1185 (5th Cir. 1989).  Moreover, an officer is not required to\n“reassess the initial probable cause finding at every change in\n49\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 50 of 53\ncircumstances or protestation of the arrestee.”  Id.     There is no\nrecord evidence that new information came to Chief Ramsey’s\nattention following the arrests that alerted him to a need to\nrelease the arrestees, nor is there record evidence that Chief\nRamsey at some point determined that the arrests were made\nwithout probable cause.  Indeed, defendants’ defense still relies\non the theory that the allegedly unlawful acts committed by the\nprotestors before entering the Park established probable cause.  \nAccordingly, it appears to the Court that Chief Ramsey\ncontinually maintained the belief that the arrests were supported\nby probable cause, and thus no constitutional duty to release\narose.  Absent a constitutional violation, Chief Ramsey cannot\nface personal liability.\nThe Barham plaintiffs’ claims as to the length of detention,\npremised on an equal protection theory, fare no better.  First,\nChief Ramsey and the Mayor persuasively argue, supported by the\nrecord, that the MPD did attempt to make citation release\navailable.  See Williams and Ramsey Statement of Material Facts\nin 02-2283 ¶¶ 43-44 (noting that defendants arranged with the\nD.C. Superior Court for arrestees to be permitted access to\ncitation release, despite the fact that citation release is\ntypically not available when the Court is in session).  The fact\nthat citation release was not ultimately available, or was\n50\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 51 of 53\ndelayed for many arrestees, was the result of unintended\ntechnological failures.  Indeed, Chief Ramsey notes that when he\nwas notified of the failure of the expedited procedures he\ndispatched additional resources to cure the problem.  Mot. for\nSumm. J. in 03-767 at 30.  Accordingly, the unavailability of\ncitation release does not appear to trigger a constitutional\nviolation, but rather amounts to negligence at most.  It is well\nsettled that mere negligence cannot lead to personal liability\nfor an official.  See Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327, 332\n(1986). \nFinally, plaintiffs have cited no authority standing for the\nproposition that the unavailability of a post and trial release\noption amounts to a constitutional violation.11  Moreover,\nplaintiffs, while alleging disparate treatment, have not\ndemonstrated that other groups of arrestees are routinely\nafforded access to post and trial release; thus, the Court does\nnot have a comparative group against which to gauge the treatment\nof plaintiffs, and cannot conclude that plaintiffs were denied\nequal protection of the law. \nGiven that the unavailability of citation release was due to\n11 The Court also notes that the Supreme Court has established\nthat the government may detain an arrestee for up to 48 hours\nprior to a probable cause determination.  See County of Riverside\nv. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 56 (1991).  Here, plaintiffs allege a\n30 hour detention.\n51\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 52 of 53\n(at most) negligence, and in the absence of evidence that the\nplaintiffs were treated differently than other groups of\narrestees, the Court cannot conclude that a constitutional\nviolation occurred.  Accordingly, Mayor Williams and Chief Ramsey\ncannot be held personally liable on these claims. \nE. Deprivation of Property Claims in Civil Action 02-\n2283 and Civil Action 03-767\nThe Abbate plaintiffs have conceded their deprivation of\nproperty claims for purposes of the immunity motions.  See Tr.\n4/6/04 at 46.  Moreover, the Court recently granted defendants’\nmotion for summary judgment on the Abbate plaintiffs’ deprivation\nof property without due process claims.  See September 15, 2004,\nMemorandum Opinion and Order.  Neither the defendants asserting\nqualified immunity in the Barham action nor the Barham plaintiffs\nhave argued deprivation of property claims in the qualified\nimmunity context; accordingly, the Court does not engage in a\nqualified immunity analysis as to any potential deprivation of\nproperty claims. \nVI. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court finds that Chief\nRamsey and Assistant Chief Newsham are not protected by\n52\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 166    Filed 09/24/04   Page 53 of 53\nassertions of qualified immunity for the mass arrest effectuated\nwithout a prior order to disperse at Pershing Park.  Mayor\nWilliams, however, is protected from personal liability for the\nPershing Park arrests by principles of qualified immunity.  The\nCourt further finds that Mayor Williams and Chief Ramsey are\nshielded from personal liability as to the claims related to the\nVermont and K arrests, the claims regarding length of detention\nand use of excessive force, and the claims regarding deprivation\nof personal property without due process.

These related\ncases arise from a mass arrest in General John Pershing Park\n(“Pershing Park” or “Park”) on that day.  Plaintiffs in Civil\nAction No. 02-2010 (“Chang plaintiffs”) and Civil Action No. 02-\n2283 (“Barham plaintiffs”) were among approximately 400 people\narrested in the Park.  Plaintiffs allege various constitutional,\nstatutory, and common law violations stemming from the arrests. \nPending before the Court in the Barham (02-2283) and Chang (02-\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 317      Filed 07/10/2007     Page 2 of 36\n2010) cases are motions by the federal defendants’1 to dismiss\nor, in the alternative for summary judgment.  Also pending before\nthe Court in the Chang case is defendant Fairfax County Sheriff’s\nDepartment’s (“FCSD”) motion to dismiss, motion for summary\njudgment, or, in the alternative, motion for more definitive\nstatement.  Upon review of the motions, responses and replies\nthereto, the applicable law, and the entire record, the Court\nDENIES the federal defendants’ motion in the Barham case, GRANTS\nIN PART AND DENIES IN PART the federal defendants’ motion in the\nChang case, and DENIES Fairfax County’s motion in the Chang case.\nI. BACKGROUND\nThis Court’s September 24, 2004 Memorandum Opinion in Barham\nv. Ramsey, 338 F. Supp. 2d 48 (D.D.C. 2004), and the D.C.\nCircuit’s review of that decision, 434 F.3d 565 (D.C. Cir. 2006),\ndetail the events at Pershing Park on the morning of September\n27, 2002, the aftermath of such events, and the involvement of\nthe District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department (“MPD”). \n1 The federal defendants named in Chang case (02-2010) are\nthe United States, the National Park Service, Richard Murphy (who\nacted as Commander of the Special Forces Branch of the U.S. Park\nPolice during the relevant period), and John and Jane Does 1-10\nin their individual and official capacities.  The federal\ndefendants named in the Barham case (02-2283) are the United\nStates, Gale Norton, Director of the National Park Service, in\nher official capacity, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, in his\nofficial capacity, Richard Murphy, in his official and individual\ncapacity, and unidentified officers, supervisors, and law\nenforcement agencies, in their official and individual\ncapacities.\n2\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 317      Filed 07/10/2007     Page 3 of 36\nThis Memorandum Opinion focuses on the role of the federal\ndefendants and Fairfax County Sheriff’s Department officers.\nA. United States Park Police\nThe National Park Service annually hosts more than 3,000\ndemonstrations and other special events.  As part of their\nroutine procedures, they coordinate with other federal and local\nlaw enforcement agencies.  Barham Fed. Defs.’ Statement of\nMaterial Facts ¶ 4; Chang Fed. Defs.’ Statement of Material Facts\n¶ 4.  Prior to the September 27 demonstrations, the Park Police\nand other law enforcement agencies participated in meetings to\naddress how to respond to possible scenarios that could arise\nduring predicted demonstrations.  Barham Fed. Defs.’ Statement of\nMaterial Facts ¶ 8; Chang Fed. Defs.’ Statement of Material Facts\n¶ 5. \nOn September 27, 2002, Major Richard Murphy was the senior\nPark Police officer at Pershing Park.  Before his arrival at the\nPark, Murphy was informed that demonstrators left Freedom Plaza\nand were heading west toward Pershing Park.  Barham Fed. Defs.’\nStatement of Material Facts ¶ 15; Chang Fed. Defs.’ Statement of\nMaterial Facts ¶ 10.  When Murphy arrived at the Park around 9:20\na.m., the entire Park was not closed off.  Murphy Dep. 228:10-14. \nMurphy was asked by an MPD official to help “hold” persons in the\n3\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 317      Filed 07/10/2007     Page 4 of 36\nPark.  Murphy Dep. 177:14-16; 178:17-179:1; 206:13-19.2  In\nresponse, Murphy radioed the following communication: “[C]ar 27,\nhave 901 deploy his personnel on the south side of Pershing Park. \nWe’re going to enclose the demonstrators up here in Pershing Park\nwith Metropolitan Police.”  Murphy Dep. 181:6-10.  The Park\nPolice (with the assistance of FCSD officers contracted to work\nwith them) proceeded to assist MPD officers in creating a police\nline on the north and south sides of Pershing Park.  At 9:35\na.m., Murphy radioed the following communication to his fellow\nPark Police officers: “[C]ar 27 for the officers who have just\nbeen deployed in Pershing Park, we’ve established a police line. \nWe’re going to keep the crowd inside Pershing Park.  We’re not\ngoing to allow them to come through the police line.  We’re\nworking with Metropolitan on this.”  Id. 193:6-12.  At some point\nduring this period, Murphy saw people coming and going from the\nsouth side of the Park and he called additional units to deploy\nthere.  Id. 229:13-17.  At least as to the west end of the Park,\nMurphy was also aware that people arrived separately and in\ndifferent groups.  Barham Pls.’ Statement of Genuine Issues ¶ 16;\nBarham Fed.

Id. 213:7-18. \nMajor Murphy had two separate encounters with AC Newsham between\n9:42 and 10:20 a.m.  During the first encounter, Newsham asked\nMurphy if the group in the Park had a permit to demonstrate there\nand Murphy told him that they did not.  Id. 215:5-10.  Newsham\nthen asked whether the individuals in the Park could be arrested\nfor demonstrating without a permit.  Murphy responded that they\ntechnically could be arrested for demonstrating without a permit\nbut the Park Police would not arrest individuals for that offense\nbecause it was Park Police policy to inform demonstrators of the\nviolation and order them to disperse prior to any arrests.  Id.\n218:22-219:13.  Murphy also commented to Newsham at that time\nthat it appeared that individuals were being prevented from\ndeparting from the area at the time of their conversation.  Id.\n219:13-15.  Newsham then paused and recounted that if the group\nattempted to go through police lines, they would be arrested for\ncrossing police lines and if they made it to the street, they\nwould be arrested for parading without a permit.  Id. 219:17-21. \nMurphy responded that this was Newsham’s call.  Id. 220:2-3. \nThat was the end of the first encounter between Newsham and\nMurphy.  \n5\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 317      Filed 07/10/2007     Page 6 of 36\nA little while later, Murphy was again approached by Newsham\nwho informed Murphy that the individuals in the Park were going\nto be arrested for failure to obey a police order, specifically a\ntraffic regulation, before they entered the Park.  Id. 227:5-17. \nIt is undisputed that all persons in the Park were “ultimately\nsurrounded, enclosed, were not free to leave and were under\narrest.”  Barham Pls.’ Statement of Genuine Issues ¶ 8; see also\nBarham Fed.

The parties do dispute, however, the role\nof the Park Police in the arrest and their intent for being at\nPershing Park. \nB. Fairfax County Sheriff’s Department\nOn September 23, 2002, the FCSD entered into an interagency\nagreement with the United States Park Police, which was effective\nfrom September 25-30, 2002.  FCSD’s Statement of Material Facts\n¶ 1.  The agreement calls for the FCSD to provide “law\nenforcement assistance on Federal parkland” during the IMF/World\nBank demonstrations.  Id. ¶ 2.  The agreement provides that\n“[r]esponsibility for the overall law enforcement operations\nduring this event on Federal parkland will remain with the Chief\nof the Force3 or her designee.”  Interagency Agreement ¶ 2.  The\n3 “The Force” is defined in the interagency agreement as the\nUnited States Park Police.  See Interagency Agreement between\nFairfax County Sheriff’s Office, Fairfax, Virginia and the United\nStates Park Police (“Interagency Agreement”) at 1, Ex. 1 to\nFCSD’s Statement of Material Facts. \n6\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 317      Filed 07/10/2007     Page 7 of 36\nagreement further provides that the “Officer-in-charge of the\nFairfax County Sheriff’s Office personnel will have an integral\npart of any decision making process that could have an effect of\nits officers, including decisions made with other agencies that\nmay be brought in and made part of the law enforcement detail.” \nId. ¶ 2.  The agreement also states that the Park Police were\nrequesting the assistance of 26 FCSD officers.

Strait Decl. ¶¶ 8, 10.  CJIS personnel digitally\nscanned all fingerprint cards for fingerprints taken by the MPD\nand entered identification data from the cards into the\nIntegrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (“IAFIS”)\n-- an FBI database that matches scanned fingerprints against\nexisting fingerprints in the system.

The FBI\nclaims, however, that these photographs are not of individual\n9\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 317      Filed 07/10/2007     Page 10 of 36\narrestees, were not taken at the direction of FBI personnel or\nwith FBI equipment.  Id.\nD. Pending Motions\nThe federal defendants have filed motions to dismiss\npursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and/or 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules\nof Civil Procedure or, in the alternative, for summary judgment\npursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  In\nthe Barham case, Civil Action No. 02-2283, the federal defendants\nargue in their motion that plaintiffs lack standing to bring\nclaims for injunctive relief against the federal defendants, that\nthe Park Police’s actions did not constitute an arrest or\nseizure, or, alternatively, that the Park Police legitimately\nresponded to a request for assistance from another law\nenforcement agency.  As to the FBI, the federal defendants in the\nBarham case argue that none of the actions taken by the FBI in\nprocessing fingerprints violated any rights of any plaintiffs. \nFinally, the federal defendants in the Barham case also argue\nthat claims brought against Richard Murphy in his individual\ncapacity should be dismissed on qualified immunity grounds.\nIn the Chang case, Civil Action No. 02-2010, the federal\ndefendants also argue lack of standing, that the Park Police did\nnot arrest or seize anyone or, alternatively, responded to a\nlegitimate request from law enforcement, and that Murphy is\nentitled to qualified immunity.  In addition, the federal\n10\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 317      Filed 07/10/2007     Page 11 of 36\ndefendants in the Chang case argue that any claims for money\ndamages against federal organizations and individual defendants\nin their official capacities are barred on sovereign immunity\ngrounds.  The federal defendants in the Chang case further argue\nthat plaintiffs’ claims under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1985 and 1986 lack\nmerit and plaintiffs’ Due Process, Miranda, and right to counsel\nclaims should be dismissed for failure to state a claim.\nThe FCSD filed its own motion to dismiss, for summary\njudgment, or for a more definitive statement in the Chang case. \nIn addition to incorporating the arguments of the federal\ndefendants by reference, the FCSD argues that it should be\ndismissed from this case based on the application of the borrowed\nservant doctrine.   \nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW\nA. Rule 12(b)(1)\nRule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure tests\nwhether the Court has subject matter jurisdiction over the\naction.  Bernard v. U.S. Dep’t of Def., 362 F. Supp. 2d 272, 277\n(D.D.C. 2005).  The plaintiff bears the burden of establishing\nthat the Court has subject matter jurisdiction.  Rann v. Chao,\n154 F. Supp. 2d 61, 64 (D.D.C. 2001), aff’d, 346 F.3d 192 (D.C.\nCir. 2003).  In evaluating a motion to dismiss for lack of\nsubject matter jurisdiction, the Court must accept the\ncomplaint’s well-pleaded factual allegations as true and construe\n11\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 317      Filed 07/10/2007     Page 12 of 36\nall reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor.  Thompson v.\nCapitol Police Bd., 120 F. Supp. 2d 78, 81 (D.D.C. 2000).  “The\ncourt is not required, however, to accept inferences unsupported\nby the facts alleged or legal conclusions that are cast as\nfactual allegations.”  Rann, 154 F. Supp. 2d at 64 (citations\nomitted).  In deciding a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, a court may\n“‘consider such materials outside the pleadings as it deems\nappropriate to resolve the question whether it has jurisdiction\nto hear the case.’”  Sweeney v. Am. Registry of Pathology, 287 F.\nSupp. 2d 1, 3 (D.D.C. 2003) (citations omitted). \nB. Rule 12(b)(6)\nRule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure tests\nthe legal sufficiency of a complaint.  Browning v. Clinton, 292\nF.3d 235, 242 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  A complaint must present “enough\nfacts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face,”\nand “above the speculative level.”  Bell Atlantic Corp. v.\nTwombly, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 1965, 1974 (2007).  The Court will\naccept as true all factual allegations in the complaint, and give\nthe plaintiff the benefit of all inferences that can be drawn\nfrom the facts alleged.  See id. at 1965;  Atchinson v. Dist. of\nColumbia, 73 F.3d 418, 422 (D.C. Cir. 1996).\nC.

In determining whether a genuine issue of material\nfact exists, the Court must view all facts in the light most\nfavorable to the non-moving party.  See Matsushita Elec. Indus.\nCo. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986).\nIII. ANALYSIS\nA. Sovereign Immunity in the Chang Case (02-2010)\nThe federal defendants in the Chang case seek dismissal\nand/or summary judgment on sovereign immunity grounds as to\nplaintiffs’ claims for money damages based on any alleged\nconstitutional violations by federal agencies or individual\nfederal defendants acting in their official capacities.  To the\nextent that plaintiffs seek any damages against the federal law\nenforcement agencies or individual federal defendants acting in\ntheir official capacities for constitutional violations, the\nCourt grants the federal defendants’ motion. \nSovereign immunity bars all suits against the United States\nunless there is an explicit statutory waiver to such immunity. \nLane v. Pena, 518 U.S. 187, 192 (1996).  The scope of any such\nexplicit waiver is strictly construed in favor of the government. \nId.  Moreover, the sovereign immunity bar extends beyond the\n13\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 317      Filed 07/10/2007     Page 14 of 36\ngovernment itself to federal employees named as defendants in\ntheir official capacities.  See Clark v. Library of Congress, 750\nF.2d 89, 103 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (finding that sovereign immunity\n“bar[s] suits for money damages against officials in their\nofficial capacity absent a specific waiver by the government”).\nNeither the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C.\n§ 701, et seq., nor the FTCA, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2679(b)(1)-(2),\nprovide for waiver of the federal government’s immunity from suit\nfor damages for any constitutional torts committed by federal\nemployees acting in their official capacities.  See Scanwell\nLaboratories, Inc. v. Thomas, 521 F.2d 941, 948 (D.C. Cir. 1975)\n(“The Administrative Procedure Act, by itself, is not a waiver of\nsovereign immunity in suits seeking money damages against the\nUnited States.”); Kline v. Republic of El Salvador, 603 F. Supp.\n1313, 1317 (D.D.C. 1985) (“[T]he Federal Tort Claims Act does not\nwaive sovereign immunity with respect to constitutional torts.” \n(citing Laswell v. Brown, 683 F.2d 261, 267-68 (8th Cir.1982);\nBirnbaum v. United States, 588 F.2d 319, 327-28 (2d Cir.1978)). \nPlaintiffs provide no other statutory basis for a waiver of\nsovereign immunity that would allow claims for money damages\nbased on alleged constitutional torts.  Accordingly, to the\nextent plaintiffs attempt to seek any money damages for alleged\nconstitutional violations committed by federal government\n14\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 317      Filed 07/10/2007     Page 15 of 36\nagencies or officials acting in their official capacities, such\nrelief is barred.4\nB. Standing for Injunctive Relief Claims in the Barham\n(02-2283) and Chang (02-2010) Cases\nThe federal defendants in both the Chang and Barham cases\nargue that plaintiffs lack standing to bring their claims for\ninjunctive relief against the federal defendants.  The Court\ndisagrees.\nThere are three requirements to establish the “irreducible\nconstitutional minimum” of standing: (1) an alleged injury in\nfact -- a concrete, actual or imminent harm; (2) causation -- “a\nfairly traceable connection between the plaintiff’s injury and\nthe complained-of conduct of the defendant”; and (3)\nredressibility -- “a likelihood that the requested relief will\nredress the alleged injury.”  Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better\nEnv’t, 523 U.S. 83, 103 (1998).  The party invoking federal\njurisdiction bears the burden of establishing standing.  Id. at\n104.  When the plaintiff himself is the object of the alleged\ninjurious government action, however, “there is ordinarily little\nquestion that the action . . . has caused him injury, and that a\n4 In their opposition brief, plaintiffs argue that sovereign\nimmunity does not bar plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive relief or\nnonconstititutional torts against the federal defendants. \nPlaintiffs do not address, however, defendants’ argument that\nmoney damages are not available for alleged constitutional torts\ncommitted by federal law enforcement agencies and individuals\nacting in their official capacities.  Thus, the Court treats\nplaintiffs’ silence as a concession as to this argument.\n15\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 317      Filed 07/10/2007     Page 16 of 36\njudgment preventing . . . the action will redress it.”  Lujan v.\nDefenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992).\nIn this case, the federal defendants argue that plaintiffs\nfail to prove the causation element required for standing.  The\nfederal defendants claim that the decision to prevent plaintiffs\nfrom further engaging in First Amendment activities was made by\nthe District of Columbia MPD alone and any arrests were also\ncarried out by the MPD alone.  As discussed in more detail below,\nhowever, the Park Police officers in Pershing Park on the morning\nof September 27, 2002 were not merely innocent bystanders.  They\nformed portions of two sides of a box of officers around Pershing\nPark that prevented hundreds of people from leaving.  The Court\nagrees with plaintiffs that the federal defendants “caused”\nplaintiffs to be arrested when Park Police officers (and Fairfax\nCounty police officers contracted to work with them) encircled\nthe Park thereby restraining plaintiffs’ freedom to leave. \nAccordingly, to the extent the federal defendants challenge\nplaintiffs’ standing, their motions are denied.\nC. Arrests in Barham (02-2283) and Chang (02-2010) Cases\nMPD, Park Police, and FCSD officers jointly participated in\nthe arrest of plaintiffs.  A person is arrested or “seized” when\na police officer “restrains his freedom to walk away.”  Terry v.\nOhio, 392 U.S. 1, 16 (1968); see also Kaupp v. Texas, 538 U.S.\n626, 629 (2003) (“A seizure of the person within the meaning of\n16\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 317      Filed 07/10/2007     Page 17 of 36\nthe Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments occurs when taking into\naccount all of the circumstances surrounding the encounter, the\npolice conduct would have communicated to a reasonable person\nthat he was not at liberty to ignore the police presence and go\nabout his business.” (citations and internal quotation marks\nomitted)); United States v. Mendenhall, 446 U.S. 544, 553 (1980)\n(finding that a person is “seized” when, “by means of physical\nforce or show of authority, his freedom of movement is\nrestrained”).  Ultimately, “[w]hether there has been an arrest\nturns on whether there has been an imposition of custody, and\nthis is a determination made after examining both the objective\ncircumstances and the subjective feeling those circumstances are\nlikely to evoke.”  United States v. White, 648 F.2d 29, 33-34\n(D.C. Cir. 1981) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \n“[T]he threatening presence of several officers, the display of a\nweapon by an officer, some physical touching of the person of the\ncitizen, or the use of language or tone of voice indicating that\ncompliance with the officer’s request might be compelled” may be\nenough to constitute an arrest, as a reasonable person may\nbelieve he is not free to leave under such circumstances. \nMendenhall, 446 U.S. at 554.\nUnder the circumstances in this case, a reasonable person\nencircled by law enforcement officers on all sides would not have\nfelt free to leave.  This is evident from the statements of\n17\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 317      Filed 07/10/2007     Page 18 of 36\nindividuals who were enclosed in Pershing Park by the Park\nPolice, MPD, and FCSD.  For example, plaintiff Sally Norton\nrecounts that police, some of whom were in full riot gear, began\ntightening the circle around individuals within the Park and were\nyelling at people within the perimeter to “move in.” \nInterrogatory Responses of Sally Norton at 7-8, Ex. 24 to Pls.’\nOpp’n to Fed. Defs.’ Mot. (Barham case).  Police also yelled at\nindividuals:  “You cannot leave, move, move” while people were\nmoving backward into the center of the Park.  Id.  Moreover, the\nfederal defendants do not dispute that an arrest occurred. \nInstead, they just argue that Park Police did not conduct the\narrest.\nThe Park Police’s arguments that they did not effect an\narrest because they had no intent to arrest anyone and they did\nnot prevent individuals from leaving the Park entirely are\nunavailing.  An arrest is an “intentional acquisition of physical\ncontrol” and the “detention or taking itself must be willful.” \nBrower v. County of Inyo, 489 U.S. 593, 596 (1989).  Whether or\nnot the Park Police had an intent to arrest anyone is a fact-\nintensive question that is, at a minimum, disputed.  The federal\ndefendants point to the D.C. Circuit’s earlier characterization\nof the evidence in the Barham case to argue lack of intent. \nSpecifically, they argue that Major Murphy told MPD AC Newsham\nthat the Park Police “would not initiate arrests” and that the\n18\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 317      Filed 07/10/2007     Page 19 of 36\nPark Police were only enlisted to “provide backup.”  Barham, 434\nF.3d 569.  As the Circuit Court was not faced with the question\nof whether or not the Park Police participated in the arrest,\nreliance on these characterizations are unpersuasive.  \nJust looking at the testimony of Major Murphy alone raises\ndisputed questions of fact as to the intent of the Park Police in\nPershing Park on September 27, 2002.  Murphy testified that the\nPark Police were “[n]ot maintaining the arrest of . . .\nindividuals” and were “basically securing a perimeter while\narrests were being made by other individuals.”  Murphy Dep.\n243:1-8.  Yet, he also testified that he gave orders through\nvarious radio transmissions to other Park Police officers to help\nencircle the individuals within the Park.  See Murphy Dep. 181:6-\n10 (“We’re going to enclose the demonstrators up here in Pershing\nPark with Metropolitan Police.”); Id. 193:9-12 (“We’re going to\nkeep the crowd inside Pershing Park.  We’re not going to allow\nthem to come through the police line.  We’re working with\nMetropolitan on this.”); Id. 321:12-18 (admitting that Park\nPolice, MPD and other law enforcement “contained” individuals\nwithin Pershing Park).  These radio transmissions raise some\ndispute as to the nature of the Park Police’s actions and their\nintent in being at Pershing Park. \nThe fact that the Park Police may have initially had an\nindependent ground for stationing officers at or near Pershing\n19\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 317      Filed 07/10/2007     Page 20 of 36\nPark other than the mass arrest -- namely, to ensure the security\nof the White House complex -- does not free the Park Police from\nliability for their participation in the arrest.  Although the\nfederal defendants argue that the Park Police acted only to\nprevent demonstrators from moving westward into the White House\ncomplex, the facts in evidence create some dispute as to this\ncontention.  Park Police and FCSD officers lined portions of both\nthe north and south side of the Park even though the White House\nwas to the west.  Moreover, Major Murphy’s radio transmissions\ndirected his officers to encircle individuals within the Park\nalongside the MPD and the radio transmissions do not direct\nofficers only to prevent individuals from moving in the direction\nof the White House.  Given the evidence presented thus far in the\ncase, the Court cannot say that there is no dispute as to the\nintent of Murphy and his fellow Park Police officers in\nparticipating in the encirclement of individuals within Pershing\nPark.\nThe mere fact that the Park Police responded to a request\nfrom a high-level MPD official to help enclose the people in\nPershing Park rather than independently deciding to take such\naction does not shield the Park Police from liability for claims\nof illegal arrest without probable cause.  In some circumstances,\nall of which are distinguishable from this case, officers can\nrely on another officer’s (or magistrate judge’s) probable cause\n20\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 317      Filed 07/10/2007     Page 21 of 36\ndetermination as a basis for an arrest even if the arresting\nofficer was not present when probable cause was established.  See\nWhiteley v. Warden, 401 U.S. 560, 568 (1971) (finding that\nofficers who assist another officer in executing a warrant “are\nentitled to assume that the officers requesting aid offered the\nmagistrate the information requisite to support an independent\njudicial assessment of probable cause”); United States v. Colon,\n250 F.3d 130, 135 (2d Cir. 2001) (finding that an arresting\nofficer in a large police department “might not be aware of all\nthe underlying facts that provided probable cause or reasonable\nsuspicion, but may nonetheless act reasonably in relying on\ninformation received by other law enforcement officials”). \nProbable cause for arrest does not necessarily have to develop in\nfront of the officer who makes the arrest.  For example, in Wahab\nv. City of New York, 386 F. Supp. 2d 277, 287 (S.D.N.Y. 2005),\nthe court found that police had probable cause to arrest an\nindividual involved in an altercation in a mall based on a report\nfrom a mall security guard that a crime had been committed and a\nbrief description of the altercation.  The court held that\nprobable cause is established “when the arresting officer has\nknowledge or reasonably trustworthy information sufficient to\nwarrant a person of reasonable caution in the belief that an\noffense has been committed by the person to be arrested.” Id. at\n286 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  \n21\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 317      Filed 07/10/2007     Page 22 of 36\nIn this case, the federal defendants argue that the Park\nPolice could rely on the MPD’s claim of probable cause because AC\nNewsham told Murphy that individuals were being arrested for\ndisobeying a police order prior to their arrival at Pershing\nPark.  A person of reasonable caution faced with what Major\nMurphy witnessed himself at Pershing Park would not believe there\nwas probable cause to arrest every single person in the Park. \nThe reasonableness of an officer’s actions is determined based\non, among other things, the “information that the officer\npossesses or to which he has reasonable access.”  Berg v. County\nof Allegheny, 219 F.3d 261, 273 (3d Cir. 2000).  Although an\nofficer may rely on information obtained from fellow officers,\n“this in no way negates a police officer’s duty to reasonably\ninquire or investigate these reported facts.”  Mendocino Envtl.\nCtr. v. Mendocino County, 192 F.3d 1283, 1293 n.16 (9th Cir.\n1999).\nWhen Murphy arrived at Pershing Park around 9:20 a.m. on the\nmorning of September 27, 2002, he was immediately asked for\nassistance in holding people in the Park.  He deployed Park\nPolice personnel, along with FCSD officers contracted to work\nwith the Park Police, to the north and south sides of the Park\nwithout inquiring about the basis for such enclosure.  Only after\nthe Park Police, FCSD and MPD began forming a police line to keep\nthe crowd in the Park did Assistant Chief Newsham ask Murphy if\n22\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 317      Filed 07/10/2007     Page 23 of 36\nthe persons inside the Park could be arrested for demonstrating\nwithout a permit.  Upon being told that the Park Police do not\narrest people for demonstrating without a permit without first\ngiving an order to disperse, Newsham then informed Murphy that\nanyone who got through the police line could be arrested for\nparading without a permit.  Only after exploring these two\npossible bases for arrest did Newsham tell Murphy that\nindividuals within the Park would be arrested for failing to obey\npolice orders purportedly given to them before they entered the\nPark.\nAlthough failure to obey a police order is a valid basis for\narrest, see D.C. Code § 50-2302.02(19), Murphy admits that he had\nno knowledge of what order each individual failed to obey, when\nand where such order was given, or whether each and every person\nsubject to arrest had, in fact, violated a specific order. \nMurphy Dep. 232:3-22.  Murphy also admits that he undertook no\nindependent assessment to determine whether probable cause\nexisted to arrest each individual that happened to be in the Park\nat the time the law enforcement officers encircled them.  Id.\n233:1-6.  Moreover, when Murphy arrived at the Park, individuals\nwere freely coming and going from the Park.  Under these\ncircumstances, Murphy cannot point to undisputed facts that\nsuggest that the Park Police had a basis for believing that\nPershing Park contained only individuals for whom there was\n23\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 317      Filed 07/10/2007     Page 24 of 36\nprobable cause to make an arrest.  See Maryland v. Pringle, 540\nU.S. 366, 372-73 (2003) (recounting holding in Ybarra v.\nIllinois, 444 U.S. 85, 91 (1979), that a “person’s mere\npropinquity to others independently suspected of criminal\nactivity does not, without more, give rise to probable cause” as\nto that person and that “seizure of a person must be supported by\nprobable cause particularized with respect to that person”); cf.\nBarham, 434 F.3d at 577 (finding a genuine issue of fact\npreventing summary judgment based on whether Chief Ramsey “knew\nthere was no basis for believing Pershing Park contained only\nindividuals for whom there was probable cause to make an\narrest”).  Accordingly, the federal defendants are not entitled\nto summary judgment based on an argument that the Park Police\nwere relying on a probable cause determination already made by\nNewsham.\nD. Major Murphy’s Immunity Claim for Pershing Park Arrests\nin  Barham (02-2283) and Chang (02-2010) Cases\nMurphy, who has been sued in his individual capacity, claims\nthat he is entitled to qualified immunity.  “Qualified immunity\nprotects government officials ‘from liability for civil damages\ninsofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established\nstatutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person\nwould have known.’”  Int’l Action Ctr. v. United States, 365 F.3d\n20, 24 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S.\n24\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 317      Filed 07/10/2007     Page 25 of 36\n800, 818 (1982)).  In Barham, when rejecting qualified immunity\nfor Newsham, the D.C. Circuit reaffirmed the Supreme Court’s two-\npart inquiry in Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001), for\ndetermining whether a government official is protected by\nqualified immunity.  See Barham, 434 F.3d at 572.  First, the\nCourt must address a “threshold question:  Taken in the light\nmost favorable to the party asserting the injury, do the facts\nalleged show the officer’s conduct violated a constitutional\nright?”  Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201.  Second, and only if the first\nquestion is answered in the affirmative, the Court asks “whether\nthe right was clearly established.”  Id.  In evaluating the\nsecond prong of the inquiry, the “contours of the right must be\nsufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand\nthat what he is doing violates that right.”  Anderson v.\nCreighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640 (1987).  The relevant inquiry in\ndetermining whether a right is clearly established is “whether it\nwould be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was\nunlawful in the situation he confronted.”  Saucier, 533 U.S. at\n202.\nAs to Newsham, the D.C. Circuit held that the threshold\nquestion of whether the officer’s conduct violated a\nconstitutional right must be answered in the affirmative. \nBarham, 434 F.3d at 572-73.  The Circuit also held that the “mass\narrest at Pershing Park violated the clearly established rights\n25\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 317      Filed 07/10/2007     Page 26 of 36\nof plaintiffs by detaining them without probable cause.”  Barham,\n434 F.3d at 573.  The Circuit rejected Newsham’s argument that\nthere was probable cause for the arrests based on the failure of\nplaintiffs to obey a police order.  Id. at 574.  The Circuit held\nthat Newsham had presented “no facts capable of supporting the\nproposition that Newsham had reasonable, particularized grounds\nto believe every one of the 386 people arrested was observed\ncommitting a crime.”  Id.  The Circuit also points to the\nfluidity of movement in and around the park preceding the arrests\nas a further basis for discrediting any attempt to argue probable\ncause.  Id.\nWith the Circuit having already decided that qualified\nimmunity was not warranted for Newsham’s conduct, this Court must\ndetermine whether Murphy’s role in the arrests on September 27,\n2002 differs in any significant way that suggests that he should\nreceive qualified immunity when Newsham did not.  The Court finds\nno relevant distinction in Murphy’s conduct that calls for such\nimmunity.  When Murphy arrived at the Park, he saw people coming\nand going from the Park.  Murphy undertook no independent\nassessment to determine whether probable cause was warranted\nprior to ordering his officers to help encircle the approximately\n400 individuals in the Park.  Murphy knew that no order to\ndisperse had been given.  Murphy also saw no violent activity by\nindividuals within the Park.  Murphy was told by Newsham that\n26\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 317      Filed 07/10/2007     Page 27 of 36\nindividuals in the Park were being arrested for failure to obey a\npolice order but he did not know which order, who disobeyed or\nwhen or where this disobedience occurred.  Based on Murphy’s own\nobservations preceding and during the mass arrest of the\nindividuals in the Park, it was objectively unreasonable for him\nto participate in the mass arrest solely relying on Newsham’s\nrepresentations that all of the individuals in the Park were\nbeing arrested for failure to obey a police order.  It was not\nreasonable for Murphy to believe that there was particularized\nprobable cause to arrest every individual in the Park or that he\ndid not have a duty to reasonably inquire or investigate what was\ntold to him by Newsham.  See Mendocino Envt’l Ctr., 192 F.3d at\n1293 n.16 (noting that the 9th Circuit has denied qualified\nimmunity “to police officers who indisputably relied on\ninformation obtained from other law enforcement officials, when\n[the court] concluded that they violated their duty to conduct\nfurther investigation”).  Murphy cannot participate in a mass\narrest not supported by probable cause and then shift all\nresponsibility to Newsham, whom he did not question despite his\nown observations.  Accordingly, the Court denies qualified\nimmunity to Murphy.\nE. Section 1983 Claim Against Murphy in Barham Case\n(02-2283)\nPlaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages from\nMurphy pursuant to Bivens or, in the alternative, pursuant to 42\n27\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 317      Filed 07/10/2007     Page 28 of 36\nU.S.C. § 1983.  Defendants argue that plaintiffs’ alternative\nclaim against Murphy under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 must be dismissed\nbecause there is no evidence that Murphy was acting under color\nof state law at the time of the events alleged in plaintiffs’\nThird Amended Complaint.  The Court disagrees.  \nTo sustain a Section 1983 claim, a plaintiff must show that\nthe defendant was acting “under color of” state law.  42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983; see also Williams v. United States, 396 F.3d 412, 414-415\n(D.C. Cir. 2005).  Circuit courts that have looked at whether\ndefendants have acted under color of state law have “focused on\nwhether these defendants are state officials or have conspired\nwith state officials in committing the alleged illegal acts.” \nWilliams, 396 F.3d at 414.  A joint conspiracy between federal\nand state officials can form the basis of a Section 1983 action\nwhen the state or its officials play a significant role in the\nviolation at issue.  See Kletschka v. Driver, 411 F.2d 436, 448-\n49 (2d Cir. 1969).\nIn this case, there is evidence that state and federal\nofficials acted in concert to seize the individuals within\nPershing Park without probable cause.  State officials certainly\nplayed a significant role in the alleged violation of\nconstitutional rights as has already been determined by the D.C.\nCircuit in Barham, 434 F.3d 565.  Murphy himself asserts that his\nactions in ordering officers to form part of the line encircling\n28\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 317      Filed 07/10/2007     Page 29 of 36\nindividuals within the Park were at the encouragement and request\nof D.C. officials.  As such, the Court denies summary judgment to\ndefendants on plaintiffs’ Section 1983 claim against Murphy.  \nF. Equitable Relief Against the FBI in the Barham Case\n(02-2283)\nIn their Third Amended Complaint, plaintiffs allege that the\nFBI used the mass arrests in Pershing Park as a mass intelligence\ngathering operation.  Third Am. Compl. at ¶ 2.  Plaintiffs\nfurther allege that federal agents worked in concert with the MPD\nto collect photographs, fingerprints, and other information about\npolitical activists.  Id. at ¶¶ 11, 152.  As a result, plaintiffs\nseek equitable relief that would expunge all arrest records and\nderivative records, including intelligence records, that were\nderived from the September 27, 2002 arrests.  Plaintiffs seek to\nprevent reputational and other harms as a result of these\nrecords.  Plaintiffs also note that there has been little\ndeposition discovery on this issue because of the general stay on\ndiscovery that was in place.\nThe FBI counters that plaintiffs’ claim against the FBI\nfails because the FBI only performed the task of processing\nfingerprints in the ordinary course of business and did not\nengage in any violations of plaintiffs’ rights.  At this stage,\nwithout full discovery on this issue, the Court finds that\ndefendants’ motion is premature.  As the FBI has control of the\nrecords plaintiffs wish to have expunged, the FBI is a proper\n29\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 317      Filed 07/10/2007     Page 30 of 36\nparty in this case, at least for the time being.  Accordingly,\nthe Court denies the federal defendants’ motion to the extent\nthat it seeks to dismiss the FBI from the case.  This denial is\nwithout prejudice to reconsideration at the close of discovery.\nG. Remaining Claims Against Federal Defendants in the\nChang Case (02-2010)\nThe federal defendants in the Chang case also move for\ndismissal of or judgment on plaintiffs’ claims of conspiracy\nunder 42 U.S.C. §§ 1985 and 1986, and claims involving violations\nof Due Process, the right to counsel, and Miranda rights.  The\nCourt finds that it is premature to address the conspiracy and\nDue Process claims until after the close of discovery.  The right\nto counsel and Miranda claims, however, fail to state a claim\nupon which relief can be granted and are therefore dismissed.5 \nPlaintiffs claim that defendants violated their rights by\nfailing to inform plaintiffs of their Miranda rights prior to\ntheir arrest.  No cause of action exists, however, for the\nfailure to provide Miranda warnings prior to an arrest.  Instead,\nMiranda merely provides for the exclusion from trial of\nstatements made by a criminal defendant during a custodial\ninterrogation if those statements were obtained in the absence of\n5 The Chang plaintiffs admit in their opposition brief that\nthe federal defendants “have a strong objection to these counts\nand, indeed, [p]laintiffs are considering a voluntary waiver of\nthese claims as to them.”  Chang Pls.’ Opp’n to Fed.

See Miranda v.\nArizona, 384 U.S. 436, 444 (1966).  The right to receive Miranda\nwarnings is not a constitutional right in and of itself.  See\nChavez v. Martinez, 538 U.S. 760, 772 (2003) (finding that\n“Chavez’s failure to read Miranda warnings to Martinez did not\nviolate Martinez’s constitutional rights and cannot be grounds\nfor a § 1983 action”).\nPlaintiffs’ claimed violation of the right to counsel also\nfails.  The right to counsel “attaches only at or after the time\nadversary judicial proceedings have been initiated against a\nperson.”  Kirby v. Illinois, 406 U.S. 682, 688 (1972).  In this\ncase, there is no dispute that no adverse judicial proceedings\nwere ever brought against any of the plaintiffs.  Accordingly,\nthe Court grants the federal defendants’ motion in the Chang case\nto the extent it seeks dismissal of the right to counsel and\nMiranda claims.\nH. FCSD’s Motion in the Chang Case (02-2010)\nIn its motion to dismiss, motion for summary judgment, or,\nin the alternative, motion for a more definitive statement, the\nFCSD incorporates by reference the motions filed by the federal\ndefendants in the Chang case.  The Court has already ruled on\nthese motions as indicated above and accordingly addresses only\nFCSD’s argument under the borrowed servant doctrine in this\n31\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 317      Filed 07/10/2007     Page 32 of 36\nsection.  For the reasons stated below, the Court denies FCSD’s\nmotion as to the borrowed servant doctrine.6\n1. Borrowed servant doctrine\nUnder the law of agency, “a person who is generally the\nservant of one master[] can become the ‘borrowed’ servant of\nanother.”  Dellums v. Powell, 566 F.2d 216, 220 (D.C. Cir. 1977). \nIf the “borrowed servant commits a tort while carrying out the\nbidding of the borrower, vicarious liability for that tort\nattaches to the borrower and not the general master.”  Id. \nHowever, “[a] person may be the servant of two masters, not joint\nemployers, at one time as to one act, if the service to one does\nnot involve the abandonment of service to the other.” \nRestatement (Second) of Agency § 226.7  Whether one party is the\n“sole master to whom liability can attach . . . is usually a\nquestion of fact, generally to be decided by the jury.”  Dellums,\n566 F.2d at 220; see also Restatement (Third) of Agency § 7.03\n6 Because the Court has considered the extrinsic evidence\nsubmitted by the parties in support of their briefs, the Court\ntreats this motion as one for summary judgment.  Plaintiffs were\non notice that FCSD’s motion was at least potentially one for\nsummary judgment and they submitted their own evidence in support\nof their opposition.  See Colbert v. Potter, 471 F.3d 158, 168\n(D.C. Cir. 2006). \n7 Although the Restatement (Second) of Agency has been\nsuperceded by the Restatement (Third) of Agency, the latter still\nrecognizes the borrowed servant doctrine and the possibility that\nboth the general employer and the borrowed (or special) employer\ncan be liable for the same act.  See Restatement (Third) of\nAgency § 7.03 cmt. d. \n32\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 317      Filed 07/10/2007     Page 33 of 36\ncmt. d(2) (“It is a question of fact whether a general or a\nspecial employer, or both, have the right to control an\nemployee’s conduct.”).\nIn this case, the facts are in dispute as to whether the\nPark Police, FCSD, or both, were in control of FCSD officers at\nPershing Park on September 27, 2002.  Although the Interagency\nAgreement entered into between the Park Police and FCSD provides\nthat “[r]esponsibility for overall law enforcement events will\nremain with the Chief” of the Park Police, Interagency Agreement\nat 1, it also provides that “[t]he Officer-in-charge of the\nFairfax County Sheriff’s Office personnel will have an integral\npart of any decision making process that could have an effect on\nits officers . . . .”  Interagency Agreement ¶ 2 (emphasis\nadded).  Under the terms of the Interagency Agreement, FCSD did\nnot give up all direction and control over its officers to the\nPark Police.\nThe testimony of the officers on the scene at Pershing Park\non the morning of September 27, 2002 also raises a factual\ndispute as to whether the Park Police were in sole or shared\ncontrol of the FCSD officers.  Major Murphy testified in his\ndeposition that the “Fairfax County Sheriff’s Office was under\nthe control and direction of the Park Police during the\ndemonstrations,”  Murphy Dep. 514:2-5, and that Murphy could\n“essentially order the Fairfax County Sheriff’s Office to deploy\n33\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 317      Filed 07/10/2007     Page 34 of 36\nin particular ways,” id. 514:8-11.  Murphy also testified,\nhowever, that Park Police Lieutenant Nieder, not Murphy, was the\none coordinating with the FCSD officers on September 27, id.\n521:12-19, that the FCSD officers had their own command\nstructure, id. 523:21-524:4, and that FCSD officers remained\ntogether in a cohesive unit, id. 524:8-12.  Moreover, Basillo\nCachuela -- ranking commander of the FCSD on September 27 --\ntestified that he told his guys “no one in, no one out” after\nhearing such a command from a D.C. police lieutenant and getting\njust a nod from the Park Police lieutenant, Cachuela Dep. 53:14-\n20, suggesting that Cachuela was still in command of and gave\norders to his own officers, even if that command and control was\nshared with the Park Police.\nThe Court finds that there are genuine issues of material\nfact as to who was in control of the FCSD officers and whether\nsuch control was shared or joint.  Accordingly, the Court denies\nsummary judgment to FCSD based on the borrowed servant doctrine.8\n8 Based on FCSD’s claim that it was just a borrowed servant\nof the Park Police and that its officers were deputized by the\nU.S. Marshal’s Service, FCSD claims that it is entitled to\ndismissal of plaintiffs’ case based on sovereign immunity and the\nprotections of the Federal Tort Claims Act.  Because the facts\nunderlying the applicability of the borrowed servant doctrine are\nin dispute, the Court declines to extend sovereign immunity or\nFTCA protection to the FCSD at this time.\n34\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-AK     Document 317      Filed 07/10/2007     Page 35 of 36\n2. Proximate cause and standing\nFCSD argues that plaintiffs cannot establish a proximate\ncause between the actions of inactions of FCSD officers and\nplaintiffs’ injuries and that plaintiffs do not have standing to\nbring any claims for injunctive relief against FCSD.  To the same\nextent that the Park Police were involved in plaintiffs’ arrest\nand/or seizure, FCSD was also involved.  Accordingly, the Court\nrejects FCSD’s arguments that plaintiffs do not have standing\nand/or cannot show a proximate cause between their alleged\ninjuries and FCSD’s conduct.\n3. More definitive statement\nPursuant to Rule 12(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure, FCSD argues that plaintiffs should be required to\nprovide a more definitive statement as to which allegations in\nthe Third Amended Complaint apply to which defendants.  Rule\n12(e) provides that motions for a more definitive statement are\nappropriate only where a pleading is “so vague or ambiguous that\na party cannot reasonably be required to frame a responsive\npleading.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(e).

See, e.g., Chang Compl. ¶¶ 33-34. On that date, all\nnamed and individual plaintiffs in these actions were at or near\na demonstration taking place in General John Pershing Park\n(\"Pershing Park\"), located on Pennsylvania Avenue N.W. between\n14th and 15th Streets N.W., when police officers surrounded them,\nalong with approximately 400 other individuals who were in the\nPark, and arrested them.  Id. ¶¶ 12, 47-53. Plaintiffs allege\nthat they were subsequently handcuffed and held on buses for up\nto 13 hours, and later detained at the Police Academy Gymnasium\nfor periods ranging from 18 to 36 hours with one wrist cuffed to\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 56    Filed 09/24/03   Page 3 of 39\nthe opposite ankle. Id. ¶¶ 12, 47-61.\nPlaintiffs in all cases assert First, Fourth, and Fourteenth\nAmendment claims against the District of Columbia, alleging\ninterference with protest, assembly, and journalism activities\nprotected by the First Amendment, as well as violations of their\nFourth Amendment right to be free of unreasonable searches and\nseizures. Additionally, plaintiffs in Chang and Barham assert\ncommon law claims of false arrest and false imprisonment against\nthe District of Columbia. Barham plaintiffs also present an Equal\nProtection challenge to the District's alleged policy of offering\nonly a \"post and forfeit\" option to those arrested in political\ndemonstrations when a \"post and trial\" option, by which a\ndetainee secures release without forfeiting any trial rights, is\ncustomarily offered to those arrested for other minor offenses.\nCertain individual plaintiffs in Barham assert conversion and\ntrespass to chattel claims against the District based on seizure\nof their property, including video equipment, bags, and bicycles,\nat the time of their arrest. Finally, the Chang and Barham\nactions also name federal law enforcement agencies as defendants,\nseeking injunctive relief precluding those agencies from\nutilizing or participating in the challenged tactics.\nAll four actions seek common relief from the District of\nColumbia: entry of a judgment declaring the Metropolitan Police\n3\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 56    Filed 09/24/03   Page 4 of 39\nDepartment's so-called \"trap and arrest\" policies and practices\nunlawful under the First and Fourth Amendments, entry of a\npermanent injunction prohibiting defendants from utilizing such\ntactics, an order sealing or expunging the arrest records of all\nindividuals arrested in Pershing Park on September 27, 2002, and\nindividual compensatory damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \nI. Class actions\nTwo of the above-captioned cases were commenced as class\nactions in which the proposed class would include all persons\narrested in Pershing Park on September 27, 2002. The first such\naction, Barham v. Ramsey, Civil Action No. 02-2253, asserts class\nclaims against Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton in her\nofficial capacity, based on plaintiffs' allegation that federal\nlaw enforcement agencies actively participated in the challenged\nconduct. In addition, Barham raises claims against the\nMetropolitan Police Department (\"MPD\") and the District of\nColumbia, as well as against MPD Chief Charles H. Ramsey and\nDistrict of Columbia Mayor Anthony A. Williams in both their\nindividual and official capacities. The second putative class\naction, Abbate v. Ramsey, Civil Action No. 03-767, interposes\nclass claims analogous to Barham plaintiffs' claims against the\nDistrict of Columbia and Chief Ramsey in his individual capacity\nonly, and seeks similar relief. \n4\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 56    Filed 09/24/03   Page 5 of 39\nA. Consolidation\nDistrict defendants move to consolidate these two putative\nclass actions on the grounds that both seek to assert class\nclaims based on the same events and transactions, and the \"core\nissues\" raised by the Abbate action \"plainly overlap\" with some\nof class claims presented by the Barham plaintiffs. They further\nsubmit, citing to the Manual for Complex Litigation, that as a\ngeneral rule, a court should not certify more than one class\naction where different proposed class representatives and their\ncounsel press competing claims. See Federal Judicial Center,\nManual for Complex Litigation at 219 (3d ed. 1995) (\"Rarely\nshould more than one [class action] be certified, although under\nappropriate circumstances subclasses may be considered.\").\nDistrict defendants contend that consolidation of these cases\nwould serve the interests of judicial economy and reduce the\nlitigation burden on defendants, and ask the Court to direct\ncounsel for plaintiffs in Barham and Abbate to cooperate in the\nfiling of a single, consolidated amended complaint embracing the\nclass allegations common to both cases.\nConsolidation is provided for by Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(a),\nwhich states:\nWhen actions involving a common question of law or fact are\npending before the court, it may order a joint hearing or\ntrial of any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it\n5\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 56    Filed 09/24/03   Page 6 of 39\nmay order all the actions consolidated; and it may make such\norders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid\nunnecessary costs or delay.\n\"The decision whether to consolidate cases under Rule 42(a) is\nwithin the broad discretion of the trial court.\" Stewart v.\nO'Neill, 225 F. Supp.2d 16, 20 (D.D.C. 2002). Generally speaking,\nwhen exercising their discretion with respect to consolidation of\nactions, courts weigh considerations of convenience and economy\nagainst considerations of confusion and prejudice. Id. \nConsolidation may increase judicial efficiency by reducing\npresentation of duplicative proof at trial, eliminating the need\nfor more than one judge to familiarize themselves with the issues\npresented, and reducing excess costs to all parties and the\ngovernment. Id. Consolidation is particularly appropriate where,\nas here, \"two cases each involve review of the same underlying\ndecision.\" See Biochem Pharma, Inc. v. Emory University, 148 F.\nSupp.2d 11, 12 (D.D.C. 2001). \nPlaintiffs in both class actions oppose the motion for\nconsolidation, although Barham plaintiffs do not oppose\ncoordination of pre-trial and discovery matters in the two cases.\nPredictably, both groups of putative class representatives submit\nthat it would be more expeditious to simply certify their class\nand deny the motion for class certification in the other case\nthan to consolidate the two proposed class actions.  Barham\n6\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 56    Filed 09/24/03   Page 7 of 39\nplaintiffs argue that their action should be certified as a class\naction because it was the first filed, tolling any applicable\nstatutes of limitation with respect to District defendants two\nmonths earlier than the Abbate action. Conversely, the Abbate\ncase was filed nearly two months after Barham, wholly fails to\ntoll the statute with respect to federal defendants, and asserts\nmore limited claims against only the District of Columbia and its\nChief of Police. Barham plaintiffs therefore contend that, at\nbest, commencement of the Abbate action reflects a desire on the\npart of the five named plaintiffs in that case to opt-out of the\nbroader claims presented by the Barham class. \nAbbate plaintiffs respond by conceding that no more than one\nclass action should be certified based on the events in question,\nbut take issue with defendants' recommendation that they be\nrequired to \"negotiate\" with plaintiffs in Barham in order to\nfile a single, consolidated class complaint. According to Abbate\nplaintiffs, \"[t]his approach would severely prejudice plaintiffs'\nability to represent the class in the manner that they think is\nbest, as reflected in their complaint.\" They further state that\nit is \"unnecessary and prejudicial to plaintiffs to require them\nat this stage to abandon their complaint and to negotiate a new\none with the Barham plaintiffs,\" suggesting instead that the\nCourt should simply decide which class should be recognized based\n7\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 56    Filed 09/24/03   Page 8 of 39\non which class action best represents the interests of the class\nto be certified. \nMoreover, Abbate plaintiffs maintain that their action best\nserves the common interests of the class because it advances\nclass members' interest in obtaining prompt and full compensation\nfrom and injunctive relief against the District and Chief Ramsey,\nthe parties most directly responsible for their injuries. They \nfurther allege that, by adding federal defendants to their class\naction, Barham plaintiffs have assumed an additional burden of\nproof, which will lead to significant delays in the proceedings,\nwithout increasing or enhancing the compensation or injunctive\nrelief available. In support of this contention, Abbate\nplaintiffs claim that any injunctive relief obtained against the\nDistrict would necessarily reach any federal agencies or officers\nacting in concert with the MPD, thus effectively barring any law\nenforcement agencies operating within the District from engaging\nin the challenged practices. They further argue that any benefit\nto be gained by the Barham plaintiffs' assertion of Bivens claims\nagainst federal officers and FBI agents is minimal, and would not\ninure to the entire class. Abbate plaintiffs therefore contend\nthat Barham plaintiffs' pursuit of additional federal defendants\nactually harms the interests of absent class members in obtaining\nfull and prompt relief. Finally, they submit that certifying the\n8\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 56    Filed 09/24/03   Page 9 of 39\nAbbate class action will not prejudice those plaintiffs who wish\nto proceed against the federal government or officers, as they\nwould remain free to do so either in a separate class action or\nindividually, and the statute of limitations for such an action\nwould remain tolled by virtue of the filing of the Barham action.\nFederal defendants also oppose the motion to consolidate,\narguing that, at least as to them, the cases raise no common\nissues of fact or law, and consolidation would thus lead only to\nconfusion with respect to which claims are asserted against\nfederal defendants as opposed to District defendants. In the\nalternative, they ask that the Court first resolve their pending\npotentially dispositive motion before ruling on District\ndefendants' motion to consolidate.1\nNotwithstanding the concerns raised by the parties, the\nCourt orally granted District defendants' motion to consolidate\nthe Barham and Abbate actions at the conclusion of the hearing on\npending motions held on September 11, 2003, with one significant\n1 The Court has also considered, and rejects, federal\ndefendants' proposal that two class actions be certified, the\nfirst raising claims against federal defendants and the second\nfocusing solely on District defendants. The Court believes no\nefficiencies would result from such an approach, as on the\nminimal record currently before it, including evidence submitted\nby federal defendants, it appears that the interactions and\ninterrelationship between federal law enforcement agencies and\nthe MPD will be of central importance to the litigation.\n9\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 56    Filed 09/24/03   Page 10 of 39\namendment -- the Court directed plaintiffs in Abbate and Barham\nto file a single consolidated complaint joining all of the claims\nraised in both cases. The Court believed that this approach,\nrather than selecting from among the two competing class actions,\nwould ultimately best serve the interests of absent proposed\nclass members in vindicating their constitutional and common law\nrights by enabling them to assert the broadest range of claims\nagainst all alleged perpetrators of the harm claimed, while\nbenefitting from the wealth of talent brought by plaintiffs'\ncounsel in both cases. Furthermore, during oral argument on the\npending motions, plaintiffs' counsel in the Abbate case dispelled\nany concerns regarding potential conflicts among the interests of\nmembers of a consolidated class by assuring the Court and parties\nthat Abbate plaintiffs had no intention of contesting federal\ndefendants' liability for their injuries, but rather had simply\nmade a strategic decision not to pursue claims against those\ndefendants. The Court remains persuaded that consolidation would\nnot result in any undue delay in resolving claims against the\nDistrict. Abbate plaintiffs were unable to offer any persuasive\nreason why the District claims would proceed any more quickly\nthan those against the federal government, given that the issues\nraised by the claims against the District of Columbia are no less\ncomplex than those presented by the federal claims. Furthermore,\n10\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 56    Filed 09/24/03   Page 11 of 39\nthe Court concluded that no one would be prejudiced through\nconsolidation, as any plaintiff who absolutely wished to pursue\nthe strategic approach vigorously advocated by Abbate counsel\nremained free to opt out of the class action and pursue claims\nagainst the District on an individual basis. \nFar from rendering this litigation more unwieldy,\nconsolidation would increase efficiency by reducing the\npossibility of duplicative discovery and by achieving judicial\neconomy in the adjudication of potentially dispositive motions\ninvolving similar material facts, a single group of actors\npresent during the events at issue, and common questions of law.\nFurthermore, in an effort to address plaintiffs' concerns that\nundue delay will result from consolidation of the two actions, an\naccelerated briefing schedule was put in place to ensure that the\nlitigation proceeds apace.\nNotwithstanding the Court's direction that counsel for\nplaintiffs in both cases make every effort to reach an agreement\nas to how to proceed with a consolidated class action that would\nbest serve the interests of named plaintiffs as well as absent\nclass members, it appears that the Abbate plaintiffs and their\ncounsel remain unyielding in their approach. By letters dated\nSeptember 15, 2003, plaintiffs' counsel in both Barham and Abbate\nadvised the Court that they were unable to reach an agreement\n11\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 56    Filed 09/24/03   Page 12 of 39\nwith respect to a consolidated class action. Based on these\nletters, it appears that, rather than make a good faith effort to\nnegotiate a way forward, Abbate plaintiffs merely persevered in\ntheir opposition to consolidation. While such inflexibility is\nunfortunate, in light of the parties' apparently entrenched\npositions, the Court will reconsider its decision to consolidate\nthe two proposed class actions. Instead, it will pursue the\nalternative approach suggested by both Barham and Abbate\nplaintiffs, and provisionally certify the Barham case as a class\naction and treat Abbate plaintiffs as though they have opted out\nof the class and have elected to proceed individually against the\nDistrict with more narrow claims. Forced to choose among the two\ncompeting class actions, the Court has selected the Barham action\non the grounds that it best serves the interests of absent class\nmembers to certify the class asserting the broadest claims\nagainst the greatest number of allegedly responsible parties.\nB. Class Certification\nIt appears clear based on the record currently before the\nCourt, and particularly the revelations contained in recently\ndisclosed reports summarizing internal MPD investigations into\nthe events of September 27, 2002,2 that certification of a class\n2 These internal reports reveal that no order to disperse\nwas ever given to those assembled in Pershing Park prior to their\n12\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 56    Filed 09/24/03   Page 13 of 39\nof persons arrested in Pershing Park on that date is appropriate\nunder these circumstances.3\nIn support of their effort to proceed as a class, Barham\nplaintiffs allege that approximately 400 persons were subject to\nmass arrest in Pershing Park on September 27, 2002, and therefore\nthe class is too numerous for joinder. They further submit that\ntheir First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendment claims, as well as\ntheir common law false arrest and false imprisonment claims,\npresent common questions of law and fact. Barham plaintiffs argue\nthat, by arresting all persons found in the park on the morning\nin question without giving a lawful order to disperse or allowing\nclass members to obey any such order, defendants engaged in a\nsingular police action on grounds generally applicable to the\nclass.  As a result, common questions of law and fact bearing on\nthe alleged absence of probable cause justifying the ensuing\narrest for failure to obey a lawful police order, and that the\nindividuals were arrested as a group without any individualized\nprobable cause determinations. See Sep. 12, 2003 Order,\nAttachments.\n3 The Court is mindful that District defendants have sought\nan extension of time to respond to Barham plaintiffs' motion for\nclass certification pending resolution of their motion for\nconsolidation of the two proposed class actions. Accordingly, the\nCourt will grant the motion for class certification in the Barham\naction on a provisional basis only, and afford the District\ndefendants an opportunity to file a motion for reconsideration\nshould they wish to do so. \n13\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 56    Filed 09/24/03   Page 14 of 39\narrests and detentions are the predominant questions presented.\nMoreover, all plaintiffs make similar allegations with respect to\ndetention conditions, claiming that they suffered significant\npain from excessively tight handcuffs, were held on buses for\nhours with their hands in cuffs, were taken to the gymnasium of\nthe Institute for Police Science and handcuffed with one wrist\nattached to the opposing ankle for up to 36 hours, photographed,\nquestioned by FBI agents, and deliberately misinformed of their\nrights. Plaintiffs therefore contend that the circumstances of\narrest experienced by all class members were virtually identical,\neven though some individuals may have suffered additional\ninjuries, such as deprivation of access to medication. Plaintiffs\nfurther maintain that these differences do not predominate, and\ncan be addressed at the damages stage.\n\"It is, of course, well established that a principal purpose\nof the class-action mechanism is to advance the efficiency and\neconomy of multi-party litigation.\" McCarthy v. Kleindienst, 741\nF.2d 1406, 1410 (D.C. Cir. 1984). While certification of a class\naction pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 is \"an exception to the\nusual rule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the\nindividual named parties only,\" class actions are\n\"peculiarly appropriate\" when the \"issues involved are\ncommon to the class as a whole\" and when they \"turn on\nquestions of law applicable in the same manner to each\nmember of the class.\" For in such cases, \"the class-action\n14\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 56    Filed 09/24/03   Page 15 of 39\ndevice saves the resources of both the courts and the\nparties by permitting an issue potentially affecting every\nclass member to be litigated in an economical fashion under\nRule 23.\"\nGeneral Telephone Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 155\n102 S. Ct. 2364 (1982) (internal citations omitted). The party\nseeking certification has the burden of demonstrating that all of\nthe requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 have been met,4 and the\n4 The proposed class action must satisfy all four\nprerequisites of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a):\nOne or more members of a class may sue or be sued as\nrepresentative parties on behalf of all only if (1) the\nclass is so numerous that joinder of all members is\nimpracticable, (2) there are questions of law or fact common\nto the class, (3) the claims or defenses of the\nrepresentative parties are typical of the claims or defenses\nof the class, and (4) the representative parties will fairly\nand adequately protect the interests of the class.\nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \nAdditionally, the class must satisfy one of the three\ncircumstances set forth in Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b):\nAn action may be maintained as a class action if the\nprerequisites of subdivision (a) are satisfied, and in\naddition:\n(1) the prosecution of separate actions by or against\nindividual members of the class would create a risk of\n(A) inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect\nto individual members of the class which would\nestablish incompatible standards of conduct for the\nparty opposing the class, or\n(B) adjudications with respect to individual members of\nthe class which would as a practical matter be\ndispositive of the interests of the other members not\n15\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 56    Filed 09/24/03   Page 16 of 39\nCourt has broad discretion when determining whether a particular\naction is worthy of certification. McCarthy v. Kleindienst, 741\nF.2d at 1410; Franklin v. Barry, 909 F. Supp. 21, 30 (D.D.C.\n1991). Prior to certifying a class, the Court must engage in a\n\"rigorous analysis\" of whether the proposed class action meets\nthe requirements of Rule 23, and retains an ongoing obligation to\ndo so throughout the litigation. General Tel. Co. v. Falcon, 457\nU.S. at 161.\nAs an initial matter, this Court held in Keepseagle v.\nVeneman that\nWhile Rule 23 does not formally require plaintiffs to prove\nparties to the adjudications or substantially impair or\nimpede their ability to protect their interests; or\n(2) the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act\non grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making\nappropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding\ndeclaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole; or\n(3) the court finds that the questions of law or fact common\nto the members of the class predominate over any questions\naffecting only individual members, and that a class action\nis superior to other available methods for the fair and\nefficient adjudication of the controversy. The matters\npertinent to the findings include: (A) the interest of\nmembers of the class in individually controlling the\nprosecution or defense of separate actions; (B) the extent\nand nature of any litigation concerning the controversy\nalready commenced by or against members of the class; (C)\nthe desirability or undesirability of concentrating the\nlitigation of the claims in the particular forum; (D) the\ndifficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a\nclass action.\nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b).\n16\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 56    Filed 09/24/03   Page 17 of 39\nthe existence of a class, some courts have found that \"this\nis a common-sense requirement and  . . .  routinely require\nit.\" Neither the D.C. Circuit nor the Supreme Court has\nengaged in this additional step of the class certification\nanalysis. Nevertheless, the Court is persuaded that some\ninitial review of the proposed class is appropriate to\nascertain whether \"the general outlines of the membership of\nthe class are determinable at the outset of litigation.\"  \nThis inquiry is one concerned with the court's ability to\nclearly identify and manage the class, and thus does not\ninvolve a \"particularly stringent test.\" \nKeepseagle v. Veneman, Civil Action No. 99-3119, mem. op. at 10-\n11 (D.D.C. Dec. 12, 2001) (citations omitted). It appears that\nplaintiffs easily satisfy this threshold requirement, as the\ncontours of the class they seek to certify are easily ascertained\nby reference to the MPD's arrest records for September 27, 2002.\nSee Franklin v. Barry, 909 F. Supp. at 30 (finding\n\"identification of a class that is sufficiently definite such\nthat it would be administratively feasible to determine whether a\nparticular person is a member of the class.\"). Once the existence\nof a class has been established, the Court does not consider the\nmerits of plaintiffs' claims prior to proceeding to a\ndetermination of whether the requirements for class certification\nset forth in Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 (a) and (b) have been met. \nPlaintiffs bear the burden of demonstrating that all four of\nthe requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and one of the\nrequirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b) have been satisfied. Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 23; see, e.g., Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521\nU.S. 591, 613-14, 117 S. Ct. 2231 (1997);  In re: Veneman, 309\n17\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 56    Filed 09/24/03   Page 18 of 39\nF.3d 789, 792 (D.C. Cir. 2002); Bynum v. District of Columbia,\nCiv. A.

Nat'l Football League, 146 F.R.D. 5, 8 (D.D.C.\n1992).\na) Rule 23(a)(1) - Numerosity\nIt appears to be undisputed that the numerosity requirement\nset forth in Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1) is met in this case:\nplaintiffs have alleged, and defendants do not dispute, that\napproximately 400 people were arrested in Pershing Park on\nSeptember 27, 2002 under virtually identical circumstances. See\nPigford v. Glickman, 182 F.R.D. 341, 347-48 (D.D.C.\n1998)(\"Plaintiffs have provided the names of four hundred and one\nnamed plaintiffs who they claim fall within the class definition. \nThat alone is sufficient to establish numerosity, especially when\nthe class members are located in different states.\"); see also\nColeman v. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp., 196 F.R.D. 193, 198\n(D.D.C. 2000) (noting that the numerosity requirement is\nsatisfied where it is clear that joinder would be impracticable);\nFranklin v. Barry, 909 F. supp. at 30 (finding that a class of\napproximately 200 persons was \"sufficiently large that it would\nbe extremely difficult or inconvenient to join all the members of\nthe class.\"); Lewis v. Nat'l Football League, 146 F.R.D. at 8-9\n(finding numerosity requirement satisfied where approximately 250\nplayers were members of the class and geographical dispersion of\n18\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 56    Filed 09/24/03   Page 19 of 39\npotential class members rendered joinder \"clearly\nimpracticable.\").  \nb) Rule 23 (a)(2) - Commonality\nThis Court has previously observed that\n[t]he primary concern in assessing the commonality and\ntypicality requirements of Rule 23(a) is to ensure that\n\"maintenance of a class action is economical and [that] the\nnamed plaintiff's claim and the class claims are so\ninterrelated that the interests of the class members will be\nfairly and adequately protected in their absence.\"  \"The\ncommonality test is met where there is at least one issue,\nthe resolution of which will affect all or a significant\nnumber of the putative class members.\"  \nKeepseagle v. Veneman, Civ. A. No. 99-3119, mem. op. at 19\n(D.D.C. Dec. 12, 2001) (citations omitted). \"Traditionally,\ncommonality refers to the group characteristics of the class as a\nwhole, while typicality refers to the individual characteristics\nof the named plaintiff in relation to the class.\" Jarvaise v.\nRand Corporation, 212 F.R.D. 1, 3 (D.D.C. 2002) (citation\nomitted). \nFederal defendants oppose class certification on the grounds\nthat the alleged injuries of members of the putative class are\ntoo diverse. For instance, they contend that innocent bystanders\ncannot assert First Amendment claims because they were not\npresent at Pershing Park for the purpose of expressing political\nviews. Moreover, federal defendants suggest that members of the\nproposed class would include \"violent and unlawful\" demonstrators\nand persons who intended and desired to be arrested, as well as\n19\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 56    Filed 09/24/03   Page 20 of 39\nbystanders and journalists, thereby leading to vastly different\nfactual and legal assertions and arguments with respect to the\nexistence of probable cause, as well as disparate damages should\nany constitutional violations be found to have occurred. \nAccording to federal defendants, because the circumstances\nsurrounding each class member's arrest are inherently dependent\non that particular individual's actions, a class action will\ndegenerate into an individualized case-by-case analysis, thereby\nprecluding findings of \"commonality,\" \"typicality\" or\n\"predominance.\"\nThe existence of factual distinctions between the claims of\nputative class members will not preclude a finding of\ncommonality.  See Prado-Steiman v. Bush, 221 F.3d 1266, 1279 n.14\n(11th Cir. 2000); Bynum v. District of Columbia, 2003 WL 21911342\nat *3 (\"it is not necessary that every issue of law or fact be\nthe same for each class member. Rather, factual variations among\nthe class members will not defeat the commonality requirement, so\nlong as a single aspect or feature of the claim is common to all\nproposed class members.\"); Franklin v. Barry, 909 F. Supp. at 30-\n31 (holding that there need not be \"commonality on each fact or\nevery issue,\" and finding the commonality requirement met in a\ncase brought by Hispanic prisoners in the D.C. correctional\nsystem who experienced varying conditions of confinement, had\nvarying degrees of fluency with the English language, and\n20\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 56    Filed 09/24/03   Page 21 of 39\ndifferent medical histories); Lewis v. Nat'l Football League, 146\nF.R.D. at 9 (\"the presence of individual issues does not destroy\ncommonality. . . . particularly . . . when . . . common -– even\nidentical -– issues of liability are present.\").\nPlaintiffs correctly point out that the case now before the\nCourt is virtually identical to that before the D.C. Circuit in\nDellums v. Powell, in which a class of persons subjected to mass\narrests on the steps of the Capitol in connection with a May 5,\n1971 protest against the Vietnam war was certified. Dellums v.\nPowell, 566 F.2d 167 (D.C. Cir. 1977). In Dellums, as here,\nplaintiffs asserted First, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendment\nchallenges to their arrests, as well as claims under 42 U.S.C. §\n1981 et seq., and D.C. law. Id. at 173. The challenged police\npractices in that case bore a striking resemblance to those\nalleged in the case at bar: \nThe group subsequently assembled on the East Steps of the\nCapitol on the House side and \"began to make and listen to\nspeeches concerning the People's Peace Treaty and related\nmatters.\" While Congresswoman Abzug was addressing the\ncrowd, at about 3:30 P.M., the police cordoned off the\nbottom of the steps, preventing anyone from leaving, and\nbegan arresting members of the assemblage. . . . The\ncomplaint further alleged that those arrested were held for\nperiods of from several hours to several days without being\nafforded due process of law. In addition, conditions of\ndetention were said to have been inhumane . . . [a]ccess to\nattorneys and telephones was said to have been denied or\nseverely restricted.\nId. at 173-74. Based on these facts, the trial court certified as\na class \"all persons who were arrested while assembled on the\n21\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 56    Filed 09/24/03   Page 22 of 39\nCapitol steps on May 5, 1971.\" Id. at 174. In that case, as in\nthis one, the \"focal point of the action is the question whether\nthe arresting officer was justified in ordering the arrest of the\nplaintiff\" without a warrant, recognizing that an order and\nopportunity to disperse before arrest is a prerequisite to a\nfinding that the arrests were justified. Id. at 175, 182.\nDefendant in Dellums unsuccessfully challenged certification\nof the class on grounds similar to those advanced by defendants\nhere, claiming that questions of fact or law common to the\nmembers of the class did not predominate. Id. at 189 n. 56. That\nargument was rejected by the trial court and dismissed by the\nD.C. Circuit, which noted that \"the only question generally to be\ntried in a false arrest suit is whether the defendant police\nofficer is entitled to qualified official immunity . . . The\nqualified official immunity issue would be tried by substantially\nthe same evidence no matter who brought suit or whether suit was\nbrought individually, by joined plaintiffs, or by a class.\" Id.\n Plaintiffs also rely on Washington Mobilization Ctee. v.\nCullinane, an action challenging similar mass arrest tactics\nemployed by the MPD at several large demonstrations which took\nplace at various locations in the District from 1969-1971, in\nwhich the D.C. District Court certified a class consisting of\n\"all persons who have participated in or observed and who intend\nto participate in or observe lawful, peaceful, orderly and non-\n22\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 56    Filed 09/24/03   Page 23 of 39\nobstructive public demonstrations for the exercise of their\nconstitutional rights of free speech and assembly.\" Washington\nMobilization Ctee. v. Cullinane, 400 F. 186, 219 n.2 (D.D.C.\n1975), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 566 F.2d 107 (D.C. Cir.\n1977) (class certification not disturbed on appeal); see also\nSullivan v. Murphy, 380 F. Supp. 867, 868 (D.D.C. 1974)\n(reaffirming on remand certification of class of \"all persons\narrested from and including May 3, 1971, through May 6, 1971, as\nto whom the defendants failed to follow normal booking procedures\nand lack [] contemporary . . . evidence of probable cause for\narrest and those as to whom . . . defendants have been unable . .\n. to certify to this Court their ability to establish probable\ncause for arrest or a prima facie case of guilt of the alleged\noffense committed.\"). Although defendants in Cullinane challenged\ncertification of the class, the District Court found that the\nrequirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 were met by plaintiffs'\ncomplaint, notwithstanding the fact that its allegations spanned\na period of years, and involved at least seven different\ndemonstrations, at which the conduct of individual demonstrators\nvaried widely, and at which the District Court acknowledged there\nwas some unlawful activity on the part of individual\ndemonstrators. See Washington Mobilization Ctee. v. Cullinane,\n400 F. Supp. at 219 n.2. \nPlaintiffs further argue that this case is distinguishable\n23\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 56    Filed 09/24/03   Page 24 of 39\nfrom McCarthy v. Kleindienst, relied upon by federal defendants.\nIn that case, the D.C. Circuit declined to find abuse of\ndiscretion or reversible error in the District Court's failure to\ncertify a class of over 7000 persons who were arrested during the\n1972 May Day demonstrations. The plaintiffs in McCarthy had\ndelayed over three years before seeking class certification, and\nthe trial court found lack of commonality based on the fact that\nplaintiffs were arrested in numerous locations in the District,\nand the duration and conditions of confinement varied greatly,\ndepending on highly individualized facts. McCarthy v.\nKleindienst, 741 F.2d 1406, 1411, 1415 (D.C. Cir. 1984). As an\ninitial matter, it goes without saying that failure to find abuse\nof discretion for denial of a motion for class certification\ndiffers significantly from a finding that it would be an abuse of\ndiscretion to have certified the class in question. See id. at\n1415 n. 11 (\"The need to defer to a district court's class\ncertification decision has been greatly emphasized throughout\nthis opinion. It is this factor that makes our decision in the\npresent case entirely consistent with both Dellums v. Powell . .\n. and Sullivan v. Murphy, previous \"May Day\" cases in which this\ncourt upheld district court decisions to certify a class. . . .We\nare by no means holding today that it would have been error to\ncertify a class in this case . . . .\") (emphasis added).\nSecondly, the Circuit in McCarthy noted that the putative\n24\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 56    Filed 09/24/03   Page 25 of 39\nclass in that case brought an action exclusively for damages,\nbringing the case within the reach of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3),\nand precluding a finding that common questions of law or fact\n\"predominate over any questions affecting only individual\nmembers.\" Id. at 1411, 1413 n. 8 (noting that \"the stakes in the\npresent case are much different [than those in a case in which\ninjunctive relief was granted to a class of plaintiffs with\nrespect to the same arrests] given the claims for money\ndamages\"). Conversely, in the cases now before this Court, claims\nfor injunctive relief predominate. \nFurthermore, in McCarthy, the Circuit found that the\nDistrict Court's determination that the motion for class\ncertification in McCarthy was untimely, and thus would result in\nunwarranted further delay and \"massive discovery\" involving over\n7000 plaintiffs was reasonable in light of the fact that\nplaintiffs moved for class certification over three years after\nthe action was initiated. Id. at 1411. In the instant case, it is\nundisputed that Barham plaintiffs' motion for class certification\nwas filed in a timely fashion. Moreover, when upholding the\nDistrict Court's denial of class certification in McCarthy, the\nCircuit relied heavily on the potential problems of litigating\nplaintiffs' abuse of process claims as a class action, finding\nthat since the existence of probable cause is not a defense to an\nabuse of process claim, even more individualized determinations\n25\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 56    Filed 09/24/03   Page 26 of 39\nwould be required to adjudicate those claims. Id. at 1414. No\nsuch claim is advanced in the Barham action. Finally, it is\nparticularly noteworthy that the McCarthy court agreed that \"the\nmere fact that damage awards will ultimately require\nindividualized fact determinations is insufficient by itself to\npreclude class certification. . . . A district court, should, of\ncourse, ordinarily consider such well-established methods as\nbifurcating the trial into liability and damages phases before\ndenying certification.\" Id. at 1415 (citing cases).\nPlaintiffs correctly point out that in the cases now before\nthis Court all of the arrests occurred at the same place and\ntime, resulting from a single police action in which the putative\nclass members were treated as a group by the defendants.\nMoreover, plaintiffs argue that neither the status of class\nmembers, be they journalists, protesters, or observers, nor the\ndifferences in the conditions or duration of confinement, are\nrelevant to the predominant issue of liability for unlawful\narrest, but rather would have an impact only on the amount of\ndamages awarded. Furthermore, they submit that any such impact\nwould not rise to a degree sufficient to destroy commonality and\ntypicality. This conclusion is supported by the proceedings\nbefore the Dellums court: after the arrests challenged in Dellums\nwere found to have violated the First and Fourth Amendments, a\njury awarded damages against the D.C. Chief of Police for common\n26\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 56    Filed 09/24/03   Page 27 of 39\nlaw false arrest, false imprisonment, and malicious prosecution,\nas well as for a Bivens claim based on First and Fourth Amendment\nviolations. Dellums v. Powell, 566 F.2d at 175. Individual class\nmembers' damages for Fourth Amendment violations were based on\nthe number of hours they were detained, whereas uniform\ncompensatory damages were awarded for violations of First\nAmendment rights. Id. \nFinally, plaintiffs submit that there is no evidence on the\nrecord to date supporting federal defendants' contention that\nsome class members may have been engaged in violent or otherwise\nunlawful conduct. To the contrary, the D.C. government declined\nto prosecute all of the cases arising from the events of\nSeptember 27, 2002 in Pershing Park. Similarly, in Dellums, no\nevidence ever surfaced, despite the government's allegations to\nthe contrary, that individual arrestees engaged in misconduct\njustifying their arrest. See Dellums, 566 F.2d at 190.\nFurthermore, plaintiffs correctly contend that the existence of a\ndefense based on individual misconduct for one or a few of the\nclass members would not preclude class certification so long as\ncommon issues of fact and law predominate, particularly in light\nof the rules allowing for creation of sub-classes. See Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 23(c)(4).\nc) Rule 23(a)(3) - Typicality\nIn its memorandum opinion in Keepseagle, the Court commented\n27\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 56    Filed 09/24/03   Page 28 of 39\nthat\nTypicality focuses on the similarity of the legal and\nremedial theories behind the claims of named representatives\nand those of the putative class.  Plaintiffs satisfy\ntypicality if \"each class member’s claim arises from the\nsame course of events that led to the claims of the\nrepresentative parties and each class member makes similar\nlegal arguments to prove the defendant’s liability.\"\nKeepseagle v. Veneman, Civil Action No. 99-3119, mem. op. at 22\n(D.D.C. Dec. 12, 2001) (citations omitted).\nIn this case, plaintiffs correctly contend that the claims\nof the named plaintiffs, all of whom were arrested in Pershing\nPark on September 27, 2002 as part of a \"mass arrest,\" and those\nof potential class members, who are \"all persons arrested at\nPershing Park in Washington, D.C. on the morning of September 27,\n2002,\" are premised on the legality, vel non, of a \"policy or\npractice that is applied to all putative class members,\" thus\nsatisfying the typicality requirement. See Kifafi v. Hilton\nHotels Retirement Plan, 189 F.R.D. 174, 177 (D.D.C. 1999).\nd) Rule 23(a)(4) - Fair and Adequate Representation\nAdequacy of representation refers to both legal counsel and\nclass representatives.  Thus, \"the named representative must\nnot have antagonistic or conflicting interests with the\nunnamed members of the class,\" and \"the representative must\nappear able to vigorously prosecute the interests of the\nclass through qualified counsel.\"\nKeepseagle v. Veneman, Civil Action No. 99-3119, mem. op. at 19\n(D.D.C. Dec. 12, 2001), citing Twelve John Does v. District of\nColumbia, 117 F.3d 571, 575 (D.C. Cir. 1997). Additionally, \"a\nfinding that class counsel are adequate [is] an implicit\n28\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 56    Filed 09/24/03   Page 29 of 39\nrequirement of Rule 23(a)(4).\" Lewis v. Nat'l Football League,\n146 F.R.D. at 10, 11-12; see also Jarvaise v. Rand Corporation,\n212 F.R.D. at 3. No serious challenge to adequacy of\nrepresentation on the part of named plaintiffs or class counsel\nhas been raised to date.\ne) Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)\nPlaintiffs need only establish that their action meets one\nof the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b). Fed. R. Civ. P.\n23(b); Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. at 614;\nFranklin v. Barry, 909 F. Supp. at 31.  Plaintiffs in these cases\nallege that defendants \"acted or refused to act on grounds\ngenerally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate\nfinal injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with\nrespect to the class as a whole,\" and satisfying the requirements\nof Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2);\nEubanks v. Billington, 110 F.3d 87, 92 (D.C. Cir. 1997)\n(describing declaratory and injunctive relief applicable to a\nclass as a whole as the \"defining characteristic\" of a Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 23(b)(2) class). \nAs our Court of Appeals recently observed, certification\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) \"is particularly well-suited\nfor civil rights actions where 'a party is charged with\ndiscriminating unlawfully against a class.'\" In re: Veneman, 309\nF.3d at 792. The fact that plaintiffs assert claims for monetary\n29\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 56    Filed 09/24/03   Page 30 of 39\ndamages does not change this result, as those claims are\nincidental to their requests for injunctive relief, rendering\ncertification pursuant to subsection (b)(2) appropriate. See\nEubanks v. Billington, 110 F.3d at 92 (\"Courts have generally\npermitted (b)(2) classes to recover monetary relief in addition\nto declaratory or injunctive relief, at least where the monetary\nrelief does not predominate.\"); Walsh v. Ford Motor Co., 807 F.2d\n1000, 1003 n.7 (D.C. Cir. 1986).5\nAccordingly, it seems that here, as in Lewis, \"the\nconclusion that the class action is superior cannot seriously be\nquestioned\" given the number of potential class members, their\ndispersal throughout the nation, the likelihood that each of the\npotential class members would have to \"conduct expensive,\nextensive discovery\" in order to establish municipal liability\nfor compensatory damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and the fact\nthat 400 separate trials for damages would \"certainly be a waste\n5 It appears that plaintiffs' class claims also satisfy the\nrequirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1)(A) because maintaining\nseparate actions would \"create a risk of inconsistent\nadjudications, thus establishing incompatible standards of\nconduct\" for MPD officers. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1)(A);\nFranklin v. Barry, 909 F. Supp. at 31. Alternatively, the\nproposed class seems to meet the requirements for certification\npursuant to Fed R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1)(B), given that separate\nactions by individual class members would \"as a practical matter\nbe dispositive of the interests\" of non-party class members \"or\nsubstantially impede their ability to protect their interests\"\nbecause resolution of issues of probable cause and First\nAmendment rights in one case may have a preclusive effect on\nother class members' future claims. See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n23(b)(1)(B).\n30\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 56    Filed 09/24/03   Page 31 of 39\nof judicial resources.\" See Lewis v. Nat'l Football League, 146\nF.R.D. at 12. Additionally, absent class certification, \"a\nsignificant number of individuals [would be] deprived of their\nday in court because they are otherwise unable to afford\nindependent representation\" given the relatively low monetary\nreturn on pressing their claims. See Jarvaise v. Rand\nCorporation, 212 F.R.D. at 4. Moreover, as the court in Dellums\ndemonstrated, there exist efficient ways in which, assuming the\narrests and detentions are found to be unlawful, disparities in\nconditions and length of detention among class members can be\naddressed at the damages stage without destroying the\ncohesiveness required for maintaining a class action. See Dellums\nv. Powell, 566 F.2d 174 n. 6 (damages awarded by jury were $120\nfor 12 hours or less of detention; $360 for 12 to 24 hours of\ndetention, $960 for 24 to 48 hours of detention, and $1,800 for\n48 to 72 hours of detention). \nAs the D.C. Circuit stated in Dellums when addressing\nvirtually identical facts, \"[i]t is precisely this situation in\nwhich each class member would have to present the same case were\nhe to proceed individually to which Rule 23(b)(3) is addressed\nsince a class action would in such circumstances consolidate\notherwise identical actions into a single efficient unit.\" Id. at\n189 n. 56. Nevertheless, given that District defendants have not\nyet filed their opposition to plaintiffs' motion for class\n31\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 56    Filed 09/24/03   Page 32 of 39\ncertification in Barham, the Court will certify the class in that\ncase on a provisional basis only, pending a motion for\nreconsideration, if any, by the District of Columbia. Although\nnot required, this Circuit has held that District Courts have the\ndiscretion to grant opt-out rights in class actions certified\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1) or (2).  Eubanks v.\nBillington, 110 F.3d at 94. However, before providing for notice\nand an opportunity to opt-out of the Barham class action, the\nCourt will afford the District defendants an opportunity to seek\nreconsideration of its decision to certify the class.\nII. Individual actions\nCounsel for plaintiffs in both cases filed on behalf of\nindividuals only, Chang v. United States, Civil Action No. 02-\n2010, and Franklin Jones v. District of Columbia, Civil Action\nNo. 02-2310, have clearly indicated that their clients do not\nwish to join either of the proposed class actions. Accordingly,\nthe plaintiffs in these two cases will be treated as if they have\nopted out of the provisionally certified class action in Barham\nv. Ramsey, Civil Action No. 02-2283.\nSeveral considerations counsel in favor of consolidating the\ntwo actions brought on behalf of individual plaintiffs who do not\nwish to participate in the proposed class actions.  Chang v.\nUnited States, Civil Action No. 02-2010, was brought by seven\nindividual plaintiffs, all of whom are law and undergraduate\n32\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 56    Filed 09/24/03   Page 33 of 39\nstudents at George Washington University. All plaintiffs were\npresent at the events in Pershing Park on September 27, 2002,\neither in their capacities as legal observers for the National\nLawyers' Guild or in their capacities as reporters for the GW\nstudent newspaper, \"The Hatchet,\" and were caught up in the mass\narrest. Plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief finding\nthe MPD's alleged \"trap and arrest\" policy and procedures\nunconstitutional, and prohibiting the MPD from surrounding\nindividuals, failing to give an order to disperse or depriving\nthem of the ability to comply with any such order, and arresting\nany person caught within the surrounded area without regard to\nwhether the individual has engaged in any illegal conduct. They\nalso ask this Court to declare unconstitutional the use of\nexcessive force to prevent individuals from leaving surrounded\nareas during the execution of the \"trap and arrest\" policy, as\nwell as the MPD's alleged practices of handcuffing an\nindividual's wrist to the opposite ankle and detaining them for\n24 hours or more in that position, engaging in threatening and\nabusive conduct toward detainees, and denying detainees access to\ncounsel following arrest pursuant to execution of the \"trap and\narrest\" policy. Plaintiffs assert that the challenged practices\nviolate the First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the U.S. Constitution, as well as laws and policies\ngoverning the proper conditions of arrest, use of restraints, and\nprocessing of individuals in the custody of the MPD.  Like\n33\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 56    Filed 09/24/03   Page 34 of 39\nplaintiffs in Barham, Chang plaintiffs also name the federal\ngovernment as a defendant on the theory that the U.S. Park Police\nparticipated in planning and executing the trap and arrest\nprocedure which led to plaintiffs' alleged injuries. \nFranklin Jones v. District of Columbia, Civil Action No. 02-\n2310, was commenced by three individual plaintiffs, all of whom\nwere present at the Pershing Park demonstration on September 27,\n2002 in their capacities as photojournalism students at the\nCorcoran College of Art and Design seeking field experience\ncovering a major news event. All plaintiffs allege that they came\nto Freedom Plaza, took photographs, were subsequently informed,\nwithout further justification, that they were not permitted to\nleave the area, and were arrested and detained. They assert\nclaims based on violations of their First Amendment rights of\nfreedom of speech, assembly, and of the press, as well their\nFourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and\nseizures.\n Although they bring claims primarily against the District\nof Columbia, D.C. Mayor Anthony Williams, and MPD Chief Charles\nRamsey in their official capacities, the Jones plaintiffs also\nname as defendants John/Jane Does who provided material\nassistance and participated in the constitutional violations\nalleged by plaintiffs, in their individual and/or official\ncapacities. These individuals could conceivably include the\n34\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 56    Filed 09/24/03   Page 35 of 39\nfederal defendants named by plaintiffs in Chang as participants\nin the challenged practices. Discovery directed at ascertaining\nwho these individuals might be would likely overlap with the\ndiscovery sought by the Chang plaintiffs with respect to their\nBivens claims, as well as that regarding interagency cooperation\nand planning among federal and local law enforcement agencies\nprior to and on September 27, 2002. Furthermore, plaintiffs in\nboth the Chang and Jones cases allege that their status as\nreporters and legal observers gives rise to particularized First\nAmendment violations. Accordingly, the Court finds that the cases\nshare sufficient common issues of law and fact such that\nconsolidation is appropriate under Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(a). \nIII. Conclusion\nUpon careful consideration of the pending motions for\nconsolidation and class certification, the responses and replies\nthereto, the governing statutory and case law, and the entire\nrecord in the above-captioned cases, for the reasons stated\nherein, it is by the Court hereby\nORDERED that, upon reconsideration, District defendants'\nmotion to consolidate Barham v. Ramsey, Civil Action No. 02-2283,\nand Abbate v. Ramsey, Civil Action No. 03-767, is hereby DENIED;\nand it is \nFURTHER ORDERED that the pending motion for class\ncertification in Barham v.

On September 27, 2002, the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department in joint action with\nfederal law enforcement agencies (and unidentified other local or federal agencies) once\nagain deployed its Civil Disturbance Units to disrupt political protest in the Nation's\nCapital; and to punish with unlawful detention and false arrest those who engaged in\nlawful civil dissent on this first day of a weekend of planned demonstrations, as well as\nthose interested non-protesters or political sympathizers who approached the\ndemonstrations to hear the political message or engage in political discussion.\n2. The F.B.I. used these mass arrests as a mass intelligence gathering operation. Working in\nconjunction with federal law enforcement agencies, including the F.B.I., the D.C. police\ndepartment compelled identification information from those it falsely arrested as a\ncondition of the arrest, confinement and release. The F.B.I. and other local and federal\nlaw enforcement agencies collected intelligence and identification information on lawful\npolitical activists, their activities, and others who associated with or were in proximately\nto the demonstrations.\n3. This lawsuit challenges what have become systematized mechanisms of government\ndisruption of free speech and assembly to criminalize dissent, and in particular the tactics,\ndeployment, and use of Civil Disturbance Units by the D.C. Metropolitan Police\nDepartment acting in conjunction with federal and other law enforcement authorities,\nagainst peaceful protesters. These units, as a matter of practice and policy, employ\n3\n\nCCaassee  11::0022--ccvv--0022228833--EEGGSS  -  J M DFo c  uDmoecnutm 2e1n5t   2  1 F6 il e  dF i0le7d/2 097/2/2090/50 5       PPaaggee  44  ooff  4488(cid:10)\nunconstitutional tactics to disturb, disrupt, infringe upon and criminalize constitutionally\nprotected speech and assembly.\n4. This complaint is the most recent in a series of lawsuits with a shared factual allegation:\nThat the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department's Civil Disturbance Units maintain and\nexecute unconstitutional tactics to disrupt lawful protest and assembly including\nspecifically the routine use of mobile police lines to interfere with freedom of association,\nassembly, speech and free movement; and the use of administrative detention, false\nimprisonment and false arrest tactics in which the CDUs will trap protesters (and others\nin physical proximity) on all sides, seize, detain and arrest those trapped/seized in the\nabsence of probable cause. These actions are accomplished through the use of\nparamilitary force and threat of force in order to deprive, interfere with, and deter the\nexercise of constitutionally protected rights\n5. The earliest filed now-pending case alleging the existence of these unconstitutional\ndisruption strategies and tactics is International Action Center, et al. v. USA, et al., CA\n01-00072, which arose out of the deployment of these tactics during the Bush\nInauguration demonstrations in January, 2001. The existence of these tactics was also\nalleged in the subsequently filed litigation 50 Years is Enough, et al. v. District of\nColumbia, et al., CA 01-00811, which arose out of the deployment of these tactics during\nthe April, 2000 International Monetary Fund protests.\n6. At each of these demonstrations, the D.C. MPD actions have been coordinated and\nexecuted in conjunction with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, among other U.S.\nagencies.\n4\n\nCCaassee  11::0022--ccvv--0022228833--EEGGSS  -  J M DFo c  uDmoecnutm 2e1n5t   2  1 F6 il e  dF i0le7d/2 097/2/2090/50 5       PPaaggee  55  ooff  4488(cid:10)\n7. The conduct challenged herein is neither aberrational nor the consequence of overzealous\nbut well intentioned law enforcement. It was the implementation of a pre-designed plan to\nengage in unconstitutional preemptive arrests intended to round-up political activists and\nlock them up in the absence of probable cause.  U.S. Capitol Police Chief Terrance\nGainer testified - - before the protests - - that he and D.C. police had discussed\npreemptive action against protesters.\n8. When one plaintiff asked why she was being arrested and whether she could please go\nfree, one officer candidly explained that she was being arrested because she was\ndisplaying political \"propaganda.\" Others were let out apparently based on their perceived\nloyalty to the government. The Washington Post reported that police lines yielded for at\nleast one detainee when he displayed a Department of Justice identification card.\n9. This complaint additionally alleges that police treat and process those (falsely) arrested in\nconnection with targeted mass political activity differently from those who are arrested\nfor other minor offenses. Plaintiffs were subjected to more harsh treatment in custody and\nwere hogtied wrist-to-ankle for hours. They were subjected to intentional sleep\ndeprivation and were not released in a matter of hours as would normally be the case, but\nwere held into the night and overnight, for up to 30 hours. The purpose of these arrests\nwas not to enforce laws, but to take protesters off of the streets on the first day of a\nweekend of planned political events.\n10. The District of Columbia maintains a policy, practice and/or custom of denying to those\narrested in targeted mass political round-ups the option to be released and \"post and trial.\"\nThis option allows an arrestee to be quickly released from jail or custody by posting\n5\n\nCCaassee  11::0022--ccvv--0022228833--EEGGSS  -  J M DFo c  uDmoecnutm 2e1n5t   2  1 F6 il e  dF i0le7d/2 097/2/2090/50 5       PPaaggee  66  ooff  4488(cid:10)\ncollateral and receiving a trial date on which to challenge the legality of the arrest. The\nMPD is advising persons caught in targeted mass political sweeps that they must remain\nin jail or police custody for an extended period of time or may secure release only by\n\"post and forfeit,\" which means the arrestee forfeits the collateral and does not receive the\nopportunity to challenge the legality of the arrest. This disparate treatment, disallowing\nthe post and trial option in the case of political round-ups, denies those arrestees equal\nprotection under the law, and also subjects those who wish to challenge the legality of\ntheir arrest to greater pre-arraignment jail or police custody simply because they seek to\nexercise their constitutional right to defend against an unlawful arrest.\n11. Federal agencies coordinate with the MPD in connection with mass political arrests for,\namong other reasons, using the arrests to collect photographs, fingerprints and other\ninformation about political activists and their associations. The Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation, among other unidentified federal agencies, collects such data and places it\nin information databases and, on information and belief, disseminates and makes such\npersonal information available to other entities.\n12. Those who are forcibly arrested and deprived of their liberty suffer great fear, harm, and\npersonal injury. The stigma of having been arrested carries on beyond the immediate\npersonal and physical consequences of the deprivation of liberty. The collection and\ndissemination of personal information and political associations effects an invasion and\nloss of privacy, as well as a profound loss of Constitutional right to be protected when\nengaging in or associating with First Amendment protected activity.\n13. These round-ups and mass arrests of political activists are anathema to democracy. It is\n6\n\nCCaassee  11::0022--ccvv--0022228833--EEGGSS  -  J M DFo c  uDmoecnutm 2e1n5t   2  1 F6 il e  dF i0le7d/2 097/2/2090/50 5       PPaaggee  77  ooff  4488(cid:10)\nnot merely remarkable that such round-ups happen repeatedly in Washington, D.C., but\nthat policy makers emphatically ratify such blatantly unconstitutional tactics. \n14. \"Ain't it a thing of beauty,\" Chief Ramsey stated on September 27, 2002, as he reviewed\nthe officers about to mass arrest hundreds in Pershing Park, \"to see our folks up there\nready to go.\"\n15. These challenged police actions create a substantial chilling effect and deterrent to future\nFirst Amendment protected activity as the exercise of one's political rights in\nWashington, D.C. now carries with it the risk of arrest, of being wrongfully subject to the\ncriminal process of the state, of being threatened with physical harm by the police, being\nbound with handcuffs, having one's identification and political activities be collected and\nrecorded - -  for no reason other than having political associations that have been targeted\nby the federal government or by the local chief of police or mayor.\n16. This complaint seeks, in addition to monetary compensation, injunctive relief enjoining\ndefendants from engaging in the challenged conduct in the future.\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE\n17. This Court has jurisdiction to hear this complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal\nquestion), 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) and (4) (civil rights jurisdiction), and 28 U.S.C. § 1367\n(supplemental jurisdiction).  \n18. Venue is appropriately vested in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391, as the District\nof Columbia is a judicial district in which all defendants reside, and, independently\nbecause a substantial part of the acts or omissions giving rise to the claims herein\noccurred in the District of Columbia.\n7\n\nCCaassee  11::0022--ccvv--0022228833--EEGGSS  -  J M DFo c  uDmoecnutm 2e1n5t   2  1 F6 il e  dF i0le7d/2 097/2/2090/50 5       PPaaggee  88  ooff  4488(cid:10)\nPARTIES\n19.

As a matter of policy, practice and custom, the MPD in joint action with federal and other\nagencies, intentionally disrupts and disperses certain targeted mass political assembly and\ndemonstrations in the absence of cause or justification.\n51. As a matter of practice, custom, and informal policy the MPD routinely violates its own\nestablished standards and engages in constitutionally impermissible mass arrests and\npolitical round-ups of targeted political demonstrators and activists engaged in mass\nassembly and political activity and others associating with them.\n52.  The MPD has issued the \"Metropolitan Police Department Handbook for the\nManagement of Mass Demonstrations\" (hereinafter the \"Mass Demonstration\nHandbook\"). According to the MPD, the Mass Demonstration Handbook is the standard\noperational guide for dealing with mass demonstrations, and the handbook establishes\nwhat the MPD claims to be proper standards, procedures and MPD obligations in that\ncontext.\n53. According to the MPD Mass Demonstration Handbook, where police intend to disperse a\ncrowd engaging in a political demonstration, the field commander shall instruct unit\ncommanders \"to issue warnings to the crowd to disperse.\"\n54. The MPD Mass Demonstration Handbook requires as follows:\n[A] [1]  The issuance of warnings shall be of such amplification and repetition as to be\nheard by the entire assemblage.\n[2] Issuances shall be made by the unit commander from stationary vantage points\nwhich are observable to the crowd, or to a large number of participants.\n[3] Additional warnings, where necessary, shall be given from police vehicles,\nequipped with public address systems, moving around the crowd.\n17\n\nCCaassee  11::0022--ccvv--0022228833--EEGGSS  -  J M DFo c  uDmoecnutm 2e1n5t   2  1 F6 il e  dF i0le7d/2 097/2/2090/50 5       PPaaggee  1188  ooff  4488(cid:10)\n[4] The warning shall consist of an announcement citing the offenses or violations\nwhich are being committed by participants and a request or order, whichever is\napplicable, that the crowd disperse. Whenever possible, this warning shall be\nwritten out prior to announcement, to ensure clarity and accuracy, and\nconsistency, if the warning is repeated.\n[5] The entire warning process shall be documented by means of an audio-visual\nrecording, if available.\n[B] As a first means of dispersing a crowd under static conditions, the unit\ncommander shall attempt to verbally persuade the crowd to disperse of its own\naccord by announced available exit routes.\n[C][1] If, after a reasonable time following the initial warning, the crowd refuses to\ndisperse, the unit commander shall issue a final warning ordering the participants\nto disperse or be subject to arrest.\n[2] If, after a reasonable amount of time following the final warning, the crowd\ncontinues in its refusal to disperse, the unit commander shall direct that violators\nbe arrested.\n55. None of the plaintiffs were afforded benefit or protection of the standards described\nabove in the MPD-issued Mass Demonstration Handbook. The MPD violated these\nstandards with respect to plaintiffs and hundreds of others.\nTHE DEFENDANTS' PLAN FOR \nPOLITICAL ROUNDUPS AND \"PREEMPTIVE\" ARRESTS\n56. The MPD and other defendants had advance knowledge that there was planned a\nweekend of political demonstration activity beginning on Friday, September 27, 2002.\n57. Federal and local law enforcement agencies discussed and planned in advance a strategy\nof \"preemptive\" action against protesters, as was reported in the Saturday, September 21,\n2002 Washington Post.\n58. Capitol Police Chief Terrance W. Gainer participated in these discussions with D.C. and\nfederal law enforcement officials. Treating the protesters as presumptively criminal, and\nindicating a willingness to act absent probable cause, Gainer explained, \"I don't know\nwhy we have to wait until after they've inflicted damage.\"\n18\n\nCCaassee  11::0022--ccvv--0022228833--EEGGSS  -  J M DFo c  uDmoecnutm 2e1n5t   2  1 F6 il e  dF i0le7d/2 097/2/2090/50 5       PPaaggee  1199  ooff  4488(cid:10)\n59. The local and federal plan was, in fact, implemented on September 27, 2002. As\nevidenced by its implementation, the plan consisted of political round-ups at multiple\nlocations and mass arrests of hundreds of peaceful protesters and any others in their\nvicinity with no regard as to whether such persons were, in fact, breaking any law.\n60. On September 27, 2002 District officials made it a crime to be a protester in Washington,\nD.C., and a crime for others to come near to hear the protesters' message or to join in.\nFACTS RELATED TO THE ROUND-UPS NEAR FRANKLIN SQUARE PARK \n61. On the morning of September 27, 2002 a political assembly of approximately 200 - 300\npersons gathered in the area of Franklin Square Park. \n62. By approximately 6 - 7 a.m. there was a substantial police presence in the area because of\nthe anticipated assemblage.\n63. Plaintiff McATEER, who was age seventeen at the time, came to the area as an\nindependent journalist. McATEER was intending to videotape the anticipated political\nevents for publication through the Independent Media Center or other press outlets.\n64. McATEER had not even reached Franklin Park when he was detained by an MPD officer,\nwho demanded to know \"Are you going to the protest?\" The officer searched\nMcATEER's backpack before ultimately releasing him. There was no cause for searching\nMcATEER's belongings, and he expressly stated that he did not consent to the search of\nhis belongings.\n65. Plaintiff SALIGMAN is a bicycle racer. She had been riding her bicycle as part of her\nroutine racing and fitness training. At the end of her training ride when she saw some\ndemonstrators who were peaceably walking onto the block together, she paused her bike\n19\n\nCCaassee  11::0022--ccvv--0022228833--EEGGSS  -  J M DFo c  uDmoecnutm 2e1n5t   2  1 F6 il e  dF i0le7d/2 097/2/2090/50 5       PPaaggee  2200  ooff  4488(cid:10)\nfor the purpose of observing their political activities. Without notice or warning, a police\nline popped up. Observing this line forming, Ms. SALIGMAN decided to move on so she\ncould shower and go to work. Without any warning, without even an order to \"move\nback,\" a police officer violently pushed her and knocked her off of her bicycle. The police\ngrabbed her by the scruff of her neck and said \"we're taking you in,\" and arrested her.\n66. Plaintiffs BARHAM and SWANSON went to the Franklin Park area in their capacities as\nNational Lawyers Guild Legal Observers. Such legal observers are routinely at the site of\npolitical assemblages and demonstrations for the purpose of observing events, including\npolice misconduct.\n67. Plaintiffs BARHAM and SWANSON were clearly identified as Legal Observers and each\nwore a high-visibility green flourescent baseball cap and a green identification tag that\nidentified each as a Legal Observer.\n68. On this morning, a group of protesters moved from Franklin Park along K Street and one\nblock north along Vermont Avenue.\n69. The MPD erected a police line at the intersection of Vermont and L Streets, blocking\nnorthbound passage.\n70. The MPD then erected a police line at the intersection of Vermont and K Streets,\nblocking southbound passage.\n71. Movement eastbound and westbound was also blocked by police and/or buildings.\n72. Police used force and/or threat of force to impede movement outside of this area.\n73. The area within the police lines became a detention zone, within which scores of\ndemonstrators, observers, and bystanders were thus seized and arrested within the\n20\n\nCCaassee  11::0022--ccvv--0022228833--EEGGSS  -  J M DFo c  uDmoecnutm 2e1n5t   2  1 F6 il e  dF i0le7d/2 097/2/2090/50 5       PPaaggee  2211  ooff  4488(cid:10)\nmeaning of the 4th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, without probable\ncause.\n74. Plaintiffs BARHAM, MCATEER and SWANSON were boxed-in by the police lines and\nhad no avenue to exit the scene.\n75. The police issued no directives other than to \"move back\" - a directive that was often\nissued simultaneously with a blow from a baton.\n76. Riot police used their batons offensively and aggressively, yelling at protesters to \"move\nback.\" Police crammed the detainees into a smaller and smaller area, closing their\nperimeter with force and violence. This created an atmosphere of increasing fear,\nprovocation and tension. \n77. At one point, a storefront window broke and shattered when the police, wielding their\nbatons offensively, pushed a trapped and tightly compressed group of arrestees into the\nwindow. The police had ignored the arrestees' pleas to stop the compression.\n78. At no time did plaintiffs BARHAM, McATEER or SWANSON fail to obey a police\norder.\n79. After surrounding plaintiffs BARHAM, McATEER and SWANSON with police lines,\nthe police then without probable cause or lawful justification, arrested BARHAM,\nMcATEER and SWANSON along with hundreds of others, mostly political activists and\ndemonstrators.\n80. An MPD officer approached Plaintiff BARHAM, who was wearing legal observer\nidentification. The officer asked if BARHAM was a law student and then threatened\nBARHAM that his arrest should prevent him from being admitted to the bar.\n21\n\nCCaassee  11::0022--ccvv--0022228833--EEGGSS  -  J M DFo c  uDmoecnutm 2e1n5t   2  1 F6 il e  dF i0le7d/2 097/2/2090/50 5       PPaaggee  2222  ooff  4488(cid:10)\n81. At no point did any MPD officer do any of the following, as is required by the MPD Mass\nDemonstration Handbook:\na. issue a warning for the political demonstration or for others in proximity to the\npolitical assemblage to disperse;\nb. issue any warnings to disperse through the use of amplification and with such\nrepetition for the entire assemblage to hear;\nc. issue any warning to disperse from stationary vantage points observable to the\ncrowd or to a large number of participants;\nd. issue additional warnings given from police vehicles, equipped with public\naddress systems, moving about the crowd.\ne. make an announcement citing the offenses or violations which were allegedly\nbeing committed and issue a request or order that individuals disperse.\n82. The MPD prevented dispersal through the actual and threatened use of force, and through\nunyielding police lines.\n83. At no time was there probable cause to arrest plaintiffs BARHAM, McATEER,\nSALIGMAN or SWANSON.\n84. This unconstitutional mass arrest and round-up was directed and approved by D.C. and\nMPD policy makers. MPD policy makers and high-ranking officials present during the\nmass arrest included Chief of Police Charles Ramsey, Sgt. Joseph Gentile, and Lt. Jeffrey\nHerold, among others.\nFACTS RELATING TO THE ROUND-UPS OF PERSONS LAWFULLY RIDING\nBICYCLES IN SUPPORT OF ALTERNATIVES TO FOSSIL FUEL USAGE\n85. On September 27, 2002 approximately sixty to seventy persons met at Union Station for\nthe purpose of engaging in a lawful bicycle ride and to demonstrate, by way of example,\n22\n\nCCaassee  11::0022--ccvv--0022228833--EEGGSS  -  J M DFo c  uDmoecnutm 2e1n5t   2  1 F6 il e  dF i0le7d/2 097/2/2090/50 5       PPaaggee  2233  ooff  4488(cid:10)\ntheir support for alternatives to oil and gasoline consumption and the pollution caused by\nsuch fuels.\n86. By law and regulation, bicycles are allowed to traverse the roadways in the District of\nColumbia.\n87. At approximately 8:30 a.m. on September 27, 2002 plaintiffs JORGE GARCIA-SPITZ, \nCASEY LEGLER, CHARLCIE LEGLER, and SAMANTHA YOUNG met at Union\nStation.\n88. It was the intention of plaintiffs GARCIA-SPITZ, LEGLER, LEGLER and YOUNG to\nembark upon this lawful bicycle ride from Union Station over to the Freedom Plaza area,\nwhere they understood a political demonstration was to take place, and from there to go\ntheir separate ways, to work or school or elsewhere.\n89. The police were aware of this well publicized bike ride, and they maintained a substantial\npresence in the vicinity of Union Station.\n90. At approximately 8:30 a.m., the bicyclists began their ride. None of the law enforcement\nofficers directed the bike riders to not ride their bikes, and the police did not obstruct the\nstart of this lawful and political endeavor.\n91. As soon as the bike ride started, however, mobile police lines popped up - - consisting of\nofficers on bicycles and on motorcycles and in motor vehicles - - surrounding these\nplaintiffs and the bicyclists on all sides.\n92. By virtue of their police lines, the police controlled the movement of the bicyclists. When\npolice wanted to stop the bicyclists, the front line of officers would wave and direct that\nthose following behind them should stop. Those who sought to leave the bike ride by\n23\n\nCCaassee  11::0022--ccvv--0022228833--EEGGSS  -  J M DFo c  uDmoecnutm 2e1n5t   2  1 F6 il e  dF i0le7d/2 097/2/2090/50 5       PPaaggee  2244  ooff  4488(cid:10)\nexiting through the side mobile police lines would be prevented from doing so. In this\nregard, the bicyclists were already seized by the police as they were riding in a mobile\ndetention zone. However, the presence of the mobile police lines was interpreted by some\nas an escort and it did not interfere with plaintiffs GARCIA-SPITZ, LEGLER, LEGLER\nand YOUNG's original and lawful intention to traverse the roadways peaceably and\nlawfully upon their bikes.\n93. The bicyclists obeyed all traffic laws during this bike ride, including obeying all\ndirectives from the police.\n94. There was no attempt by the police to obstruct the bike ride as it proceeded, nor did the\npolice suggest that there was even any problem. Some of the cyclists even misinterpreted\nthe police escort as a measure of support or success.\n95. As the bike ride entered its final leg near the Freedom Plaza and Pershing Park area the\ncyclists were confronted by a stationary police line in their way.\n96. The police forced the bicyclists into Pershing Park which is across from Freedom Plaza\nand which held about 300 demonstrators at that time. The police ordered them off of their\nbicycles. The cyclists complied, as this was about where they intended to terminate their\nride, and many initially thought there was nothing wrong.\n97. However, a few minutes later when plaintiffs CASEY LEGLER and her partner\nSAMANTHA YOUNG attempted to leave Pershing Park because they had to go to work\nlater that day, they were told by the police that \"no one is allowed to leave the park.\"\n98. The police had surrounded these plaintiffs and the park, using police lines that had\npopped up on all sides, and refused to let anyone leave the park.\n24\n\nCCaassee  11::0022--ccvv--0022228833--EEGGSS  -  J M DFo c  uDmoecnutm 2e1n5t   2  1 F6 il e  dF i0le7d/2 097/2/2090/50 5       PPaaggee  2255  ooff  4488(cid:10)\n99. One officer told CASEY LEGLER and YOUNG that they were not allowed to leave\nbecause their bikes were displaying \"propaganda.\" The officer told them that they could\nleave if they removed the propaganda, which consisted in part of a sign displaying a\nwomen's symbol. They complied with the officer's request removing their First\nAmendment protected materials. The officer took their signs and destroyed them, and\nthen continued to refuse to let them leave.\n100. CASEY LEGLER and YOUNG approached an MPD Lieutenant and asked why they\nwere not being allowed to leave and if they were being arrested. \n101. The Lieutenant advised that \"At this point in time Ma'am, we are just following orders.\"\n102. The defendants refused to allow plaintiffs GARCIA-SPITZ, LEGLER, LEGLER and\nYOUNG to disperse or leave the park and subsequently falsely arrested each in the\nmanner described below.\nFACTS RELATING TO THE ROUND-UPS OF PERSONS IN PERSHING PARK\n103. Demonstrators began gathering in parkland near the intersection of 14th Street and\nPennsylvania Avenue, NW, between approximately 8:00 - 9:00 a.m. on September 27,\n2002.\n104. Demonstrators had planned to engage to protest in Freedom Plaza, which is adjacent to\nPershing Park. However, police officers directed demonstrators into Pershing Park and\nthe political assemblage gathered there.\n105. Pershing Park is a public forum under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of\nthe Interior, National Park Service.\n106. Plaintiffs MARY CANALES and SALLY NORTON are each registered nurses who were\n25\n\nCCaassee  11::0022--ccvv--0022228833--EEGGSS  -  J M DFo c  uDmoecnutm 2e1n5t   2  1 F6 il e  dF i0le7d/2 097/2/2090/50 5       PPaaggee  2266  ooff  4488(cid:10)\nin Washington, D.C. for the purpose of attending a nursing conference, \"Advancing\nNursing Practice Excellence: State of the Science,\" which was being held at the Marriott\nHotel that is near Pershing Park.\n107. Drs. CANALES and NORTON decided to leave the Marriott Hotel to get breakfast,\nwhich they did at approximately 8:30 a.m. They were aware, from news reports, that there\nwere demonstrations anticipated in Washington, D.C. that day, and they saw that\ndemonstrators were gathered at Pershing Park. After picking up coffee, they entered the\npark in order to listen to any political speakers that might be giving a speech there.\n108. There was an evident police presence, but no indication to Doctors CANALES or\nNORTON that there was a problem. They passed by the police and entered without event.\n109. At about the same time, plaintiff JERI WOHLBERG, a graduate student in nursing who\nwas presenting research at the conference at the Marriott, decided that she wanted to\nparticipate in the demonstration in Pershing Park. She knew of the demonstration from\nthe media coverage and wished to support its political message. She could hear and see\nthe demonstration from the Marriott. She, too, entered the park passing by the police who\nwere not indicating any imminent police round-up or similar problem. Ms. WOHLBERG\nmet up with plaintiffs CANALES and NORTON in the park.\n110. Plaintiffs WOHLBERG, CANALES and NORTON all observed what was occurring in\nPershing park at that time, just before the mass arrest and political round-up: dancing,\nsinging and assembly. Some people were rhythmically beating drums. Many protesters\nheld signs protesting corporate globalization and greed. Other signs advocated for peace,\nagainst war in Iraq, and bore messages such as \"bread not bombs.\" Clearly it was a\n26\n\nCCaassee  11::0022--ccvv--0022228833--EEGGSS  -  J M DFo c  uDmoecnutm 2e1n5t   2  1 F6 il e  dF i0le7d/2 097/2/2090/50 5       PPaaggee  2277  ooff  4488(cid:10)\ngathering of individuals engaging in political speech, assembly and camaraderie.\n111. At a time between 9:00 a.m. and 9:30 a.m., the bicyclists were forced into the Park, and\nshortly thereafter police lines were erected without any notice or warning. Many of those\nsurrounded had no immediate awareness that they had been trapped and seized.\n112. A session of the nursing conference was set to begin at 9:45 a.m. CANALES, NORTON\nand WOHLBERG found, however, that they had been surrounded by these police lines\nthat had silently popped up on all sides. They found unyielding police lines in every\ndirection, with many officers in intimidating, black, full riot gear. They attempted to leave\nand asked permission to leave of no less than five separate officers. They explained they\nhad to attend the conference, and displayed their conference tote bags.\n113. This was similar to the experiences that other plaintiffs who happened also to be in the\npark were having.\n114. Plaintiff WILLIAM DURHAM went to Pershing Park as a protester. He arrived at the\npark, and observed a drum circle there with people cheering and chanting. Soon\nthereafter, he and others realized that police lines had popped up on all sides. The police\nrefused to allow DURHAM to leave.\n115. Plaintiff NOAH FALK is a law student at the George Washington University School of\nLaw. He was in Pershing Park in his capacity as a National Lawyers Guild Legal\nObserver, and was clearly identifiable as such based on the flourescent green Legal\nObserver cap and green badge he was displaying. FALK was lawfully standing in the park\nwhen he found himself surrounded by police lines.\n116. Plaintiff MARK JACKSON is an independent contractor with the Underground Railroad\n27\n\nCCaassee  11::0022--ccvv--0022228833--EEGGSS  -  J M DFo c  uDmoecnutm 2e1n5t   2  1 F6 il e  dF i0le7d/2 097/2/2090/50 5       PPaaggee  2288  ooff  4488(cid:10)\nand Freedom Center, and works with a curator at the American History Museum. He was\nnot protesting, but had walked over to the park and planned to head to work when he\nfound himself surrounded by police lines that had quietly popped up. He asked to be\nallowed past the police line, but the police refused him passage, explaining \"we can't let\nyou out.\"\n117. Plaintiff JOHN PASSACANTANDO had been riding his bicycle to work that morning to\navoid what had been predicted to be difficult traffic. He stopped near Pershing Park to\nobserve the protest. Thereafter he, too, found himself surrounded by police lines on all\nsides with police refusing to let him leave. PASSACANTANDO asked no less than a\ndozen officers at different locations to be allowed to leave and go on his way, but he was\ntold repeatedly that he was not allowed to leave. A number of the officers advised that\nthey were acting under \"orders.\"\n118. Plaintiff JOSEPH PHELAN is a student at Hunter College in New York, and was present\nin Pershing Park to participate in the protests.  When he sought to leave the park, MPD\nofficers told him he could not leave.  He asked one officer “Am I being detained” and was\ntold “no.”  When he then said, “So we can leave,” the officer stated “If you try to leave,\nyou’ll be arrested.”\n119. Plaintiff NICOLE PRICHARD was riding her bicycle around the City when she found\nherself amidst the group of protesters on bicycles.  She was almost immediately thereafter\nforced into Pershing Park, where she found herself surrounded by police lines on all sides\nand, when she sought to leave, was told by an MPD officer “no one goes in and no one\ngoes out unless on that [mass arrest] bus.”  \n28\n\nCCaassee  11::0022--ccvv--0022228833--EEGGSS  -  J M DFo c  uDmoecnutm 2e1n5t   2  1 F6 il e  dF i0le7d/2 097/2/2090/50 5       PPaaggee  2299  ooff  4488(cid:10)\n120. Plaintiff MORGAN RESS is an artist who works with ABC No Rio, an artist space on\nthe lower east side of Manhattan, NY. RESS was in Pershing Park as a demonstrator and\nas a photographer and artist. He heard the sound of protest drums in the park, entered the\npark, and soon found that the police had formed lines around the park. He asked multiple\nofficers if he could please leave, and each refused to let him go. Some officers were\nsilent, others told him to go to another police line. When he did so he would either be\ndirected to go to yet another police line or would be met with silence. One officer\nexplained, \"Our orders are no one leaves the park.\"\n121. Plaintiff MACDONALD SCOTT is employed as the Membership Coordinator for the\nNational Lawyers Guild in New York City. He was peacefully protesting in the park\nwhen he found himself surrounded on all sides by police lines.  He requested of at least\nfive police officers that they allow him to leave the park, and each time was refused.\n122. Plaintiff LESLEY WOOD is a doctoral candidate at Columbia University. She was\npeacefully protesting in Pershing Park when without notice or warning the police formed\nlines around the park.  She requested of at least five police officers that they allow her to\nleave the park, and each time was refused.\n123. Plaintiff STEPHEN ZIMMERMAN is a law student at George Washington University\nLaw School and was a National Lawyers Guild Legal Observer present in Pershing Park\nwhen police surrounded the park. He tried to leave, but was not allowed.\n124. At no time did any of plaintiffs CANALES, DURHAM, FALK, GARCIA-SPITZ,\nJACKSON, LEGLER, LEGLER, NORTON, PASSACANTANDO, PHELAN,\nPRICHARD, RESS, SCOTT, WOHLBERG, WOOD, YOUNG, or ZIMMERMAN fail to\n29\n\nCCaassee  11::0022--ccvv--0022228833--EEGGSS  -  J M DFo c  uDmoecnutm 2e1n5t   2  1 F6 il e  dF i0le7d/2 097/2/2090/50 5       PPaaggee  3300  ooff  4488(cid:10)\nobey a police order.\n125. The police actions in the vicinity of Pershing Park were executed by MPD police, U.S.\nPark Police under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior, and other as-yet-\nunidentified law enforcement agencies and officers.\n126. After surrounding plaintiffs CANALES, DURHAM, FALK, GARCIA-SPITZ,\nJACKSON, LEGLER, LEGLER, NORTON, PASSACANTANDO, PHELAN,\nPRICHARD, RESS, SCOTT, WOHLBERG, WOOD, YOUNG and ZIMMERMAN with\npolice lines, the police then without probable cause or lawful justification, arrested each\nof them along with hundreds of others, mostly political activists and demonstrators.\n127. At no point did any MPD officer do any of the following, as is required by the MPD Mass\nDemonstration Handbook:\na. issue a warning for the political demonstration or for others in proximity to the\npolitical assemblage to disperse;\nb. issue any warnings to disperse through the use of amplification and with such\nrepetition for the entire assemblage to hear;\nc. issue any warning to disperse from stationary vantage points observable to the\ncrowd or to a large number of participants;\nd. issue additional warnings given from police vehicles, equipped with public\naddress systems, moving about the crowd.\ne. make an announcement citing the offenses or violations which were allegedly\nbeing committed and issue a request or order that individuals disperse.\n128. The MPD and other police prevented dispersal through the actual and threatened use of\nforce, and through unyielding police lines.\n129. Captain MURPHY ordered U.S. Park Police forces “to enclose the demonstrators . . . in\n30\n\nCCaassee  11::0022--ccvv--0022228833--EEGGSS  -  J M DFo c  uDmoecnutm 2e1n5t   2  1 F6 il e  dF i0le7d/2 097/2/2090/50 5       PPaaggee  3311  ooff  4488(cid:10)\nPershing Park with Metropolitan Police.” MURPHY also ordered and advised U.S. Park\nPolice forces to “keep the crowd inside Pershing Park. We’re not going to allow them to\ncome through the police line. We’re working with [D.C.] Metropolitan [Police] on this.” \n130. At no time was there probable cause to arrest any of plaintiffs CANALES, DURHAM,\nFALK, GARCIA-SPITZ, JACKSON, LEGLER, LEGLER, NORTON,\nPASSACANTANDO, PHELAN, PRICHARD, RESS, SCOTT, WOHLBERG, WOOD,\nYOUNG or ZIMMERMAN.\n131. The police used pop up police lines to unlawfully seize and detain hundreds of political\nactivists and those who associated with them or were within physical proximity of their\npolitical assemblage. The police then executed a new phase of the police plan.\n132. Riot police used their batons offensively and aggressively, yelling at protesters to \"move\nin, move in!\" and telling them \"You cannot leave, move, move!\" Police crammed the\ndetainees into a smaller and smaller area, closing their perimeter with force and violence.\nThis created an atmosphere of increasing fear, provocation and tension. \n133. It appeared to some that the police were trying to provoke a violent reaction from those\nthey were abusing.\n134. Protesters responded by yelling at each other \"Do what they say!\" and \"Cover your head!\"\n135. Police continued pushing protesters with violence and force. At points the perimeter was\ncollapsing inward with such a fierce pace that different officers were ordering people to\nmove in different directions.\n136. All of the plaintiffs obeyed the police's unlawful orders.\n137. The arrestees were tightly compacted in the Southwest corner of the Park.\n31\n\nCCaassee  11::0022--ccvv--0022228833--EEGGSS  -  J M DFo c  uDmoecnutm 2e1n5t   2  1 F6 il e  dF i0le7d/2 097/2/2090/50 5       PPaaggee  3322  ooff  4488(cid:10)\n138. Small groups of MPD officers began a process of crossing the police line, grabbing an\nindividual, dragging that individual to the outside of the police line, violently throwing\nhim or her face down to the ground, using three of four officers to exert force upon the\nnon-resisting arrestee, handcuffing him or her, and placing him or her on a bus.\n139. This happened to the first four or five people in a row, until the most violent officers were\nrestrained by other officers and told to calm down.\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS\n(proposed class to encompass those falsely arrested in Pershing Park)\n140. The proposed class is: All persons who were arrested on September 27, 2002 as part of\nthe mass arrests of persons that took place in Pershing Park.\n141. The proposed class and their claims, satisfy the requirements of Rules 23(a) and (b)(3).\n142. The class of persons subject to the mass arrest in Pershing Park on September 27, 2002,\nwhich is composed of more than 400 persons, is too numerous for joinder.\n143. These individuals' claims that their First, Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights and\ntheir common law rights against false arrest and false imprisonment were violated raise\ncommon questions of law and fact.\n144. By arresting virtually all of the participants in, and onlookers at, a peaceful political\nassemblage without probable cause or lawful justification, defendants acted on grounds\ngenerally applicable to the class.\n145. According to Peter Lavalee, the D.C. Corporation Counsel's communication director as\nquoted in the Washington City Paper, \"We no-papered everything in Pershing Park. We\ndid not feel in the cases that came from Pershing Park – that the witness statements and\n32\n\nCCaassee  11::0022--ccvv--0022228833--EEGGSS  -  J M DFo c  uDmoecnutm 2e1n5t   2  1 F6 il e  dF i0le7d/2 097/2/2090/50 5       PPaaggee  3333  ooff  4488(cid:10)\nthe evidence that we had [presented] probable cause that a crime was committed and/or\nthat a specific individual committed a crime.\"1\n146. The claims of the named plaintiffs are typical of the claims of this class, as they were\nlawfully present in Pershing Park when they were arrested without basis on April 15 as\npart of the same police sweep.\n147. The named plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the members of\nthis class.\nFACTS COMMON TO THE PROCESSING OF ALL PLAINTIFFS\n148. The plastic handcuffs placed on many individuals were excessively tight.  All plaintiffs\nexperienced pain, and many experienced swelling and numbness from the handcuffs.  \n149. Arrested individuals were held on busses for many hours, with their hands handcuffed\nbehind their backs.\n150. Sequential busloads of arrested individuals were eventually taken off the bus and brought\ninto the gymnasium of the Institute for Police Science at Blue Plains.  They were then\nshackled and hog-tied with their right wrists handcuffed to their left ankles.  Some were\nleft in this position for many hours.\n151. Inside the gymnasium, law enforcement officials photographed the individuals arrested. \nPhotographs were taken of some arrestees that were in addition to their \"mug shots.\"\nSome demonstrators with political statements on their clothing were singled out and\n1 Jason Cherkis, \"Boss Hogtie: Police Chief Charles Ramsey had a plan for the more than\n400 people in Pershing Park last September: Arrest them all, detain them for hours, and then tie\nthem wrist to ankle for 12 hours. He says he'll do it again,\" The Washington City Paper, January\n17-23, 2003 at 20, 23.\n33\n\nCCaassee  11::0022--ccvv--0022228833--EEGGSS  -  J M DFo c  uDmoecnutm 2e1n5t   2  1 F6 il e  dF i0le7d/2 097/2/2090/50 5       PPaaggee  3344  ooff  4488(cid:10)\nphotographed with greater scrutiny.\n152. The Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, whose agents\nsometimes displayed FBI identification, participated in this mass collection of data. This\ndata has been recorded and collected in databases, record-keeping or other information\nsystems and, on information and belief, has also been disseminated or made available to\nunknown agencies and entities.\n153. The MPD maintains a policy, practice or custom of treating persons arrested in\nconnection with mass political arrests differently than others who have been arrested for\nsimilar minor offenses.\n154. The MPD maintains a policy, practice and custom of preventive detention for targeted\npersons or groups engaged in political activity. By way of example, documents secured\nthrough subpoena in International Action Center, et al. v. U.S.A., et al. include\nproduction notes for an MPD training video related to mass demonstrations, in which the\nsection on \"Police Tactics and Issues\" includes \"Tactics - Locking up the troublemakers\non the first night.\"\n155. The MPD maintains a policy, practice and custom of holding targeted political arrestees\nwho have been (falsely) charged only with minor offenses for extended periods of time, in\norder to take them off of the streets and prevent them from engaging in further political\ndissent on subsequent days of demonstration, and to induce fatigue through sleep\ndeprivation. By way of example, documents secured through subpoena in International\nAction Center, et al. v. United States of America, et al. include production notes for an\nMPD training video related to mass demonstrations, in which the section on \"Police\n34\n\nCCaassee  11::0022--ccvv--0022228833--EEGGSS  -  J M DFo c  uDmoecnutm 2e1n5t   2  1 F6 il e  dF i0le7d/2 097/2/2090/50 5       PPaaggee  3355  ooff  4488(cid:10)\nTactics and Issues\" includes \"Tactics - Sleep deprivation tactics.\"\n156. The MPD ordinarily allows qualified persons to \"post and trial\" - -  which means that the\narrestee can post collateral in order to secure prompt release and can return for a future\ntrial date on which the arrestee may challenge the legality of her arrest.\n157. However, similarly situated persons as part of a mass political arrests or roundups are\nrefused this option, to \"post and trial.\" Instead, it is the policy, practice and/or custom of\nthe MPD that targeted political arrestees are offered only the option to \"post and forfeit\"\ncollateral. Police advise targeted political arrestees that, should they opt to challenge the\nlegality of their arrest, they will not be released for an extended period of days. The\nperiod of threatened additional confinement and jail ranges arbitrarily from between two\ndays to a week or more.\n158. Plaintiffs were confined by defendants into the middle of the night or until the following\nday, for approximate periods of time ranging from no less than 14 hours to over 30 hours.\nUnconstitutional Policies of the MPD\n159. The MPD, and those federal agencies which act jointly with the MPD and its \"Civil\nDisturbance Units,\" maintain the policy, practice and/or custom of abusing their state\nauthority to disturb and disrupt targeted civil political assembly and mass demonstrations.\n160. The CDUs also accomplish their disruption strategy through their established practice and\npolicy of preventive detention of political activists, in which the CDUs will trap, seize\nand arrest groups of protesters by closing off all avenues of exit with riot gear clad police.\n161. The MPD and its CDUs maintain the policy, practice and/or custom of deploying police\nlines where circumstances do not justify such deployment and for the purpose of\n35\n\nCCaassee  11::0022--ccvv--0022228833--EEGGSS  -  J M DFo c  uDmoecnutm 2e1n5t   2  1 F6 il e  dF i0le7d/2 097/2/2090/50 5       PPaaggee  3366  ooff  4488(cid:10)\ndisrupting First Amendment protected assembly, speech and petition activities.\n162. These riot squads use force and the threat of force to enforce this preventive detention, in\nwhich they arrest and hold detainees for a significant period of time. Absent intervening\ncircumstances, the detainees will be placed on mass arrest busses and held for significant\nperiods of time, typically overnight.\n163. Preventive detention signifies that individuals are being arrested not for engaging in\nillegal activity but for engaging in political activity, and constitutes a severe violation of\nFirst and Fourth Amendment rights when applied against political demonstrators.  \n164. The use of disruption and disturbance tactics by the MPD is an established custom, policy\nand practice of the MPD, as evidenced by the repeated use, the approval of, and the\nacquiescence in the use of such tactics by policy making officials of the District of\nColumbia.\n165. DC policy maker Mayor Anthony Williams has stated his approval of the MPD's tactics,\nreferring to arrest tactics of the MPD, as executed on April 15, 2000 (and repeated on\nInauguration Day 2001 and on September 27, 2002) as \"preventative\" and \"proactive.\"\nPreventive detention and false arrest, whether referred to as \"preventative arrest\" or\n\"proactive arrest,\" when applied to a targeted group of persons seeking to exercise\nconstitutionally protected rights, in the absence of probable cause, is unconstitutional.\n166. MPD policy makers approve of these tactics, which they have used repeatedly, and which\nare the subject of pending litigation related to their use on Inauguration Day\n(International Action Center et al. v. United States et al., 01-CV-72) and on April 15,\n2000 (Fifty Years Is Enough et al. v. District of Columbia et al., 01-CV-811). In the\n36\n\nCCaassee  11::0022--ccvv--0022228833--EEGGSS  -  J M DFo c  uDmoecnutm 2e1n5t   2  1 F6 il e  dF i0le7d/2 097/2/2090/50 5       PPaaggee  3377  ooff  4488(cid:10)\nalternative, MPD policy makers have acquiesced to these unconstitutional tactics.\n167. On September 27, 2002, the CDUs and other MPD officers were deployed for these\nunconstitutional purposes.\n168. On September 27, 2002, the Department of the Interior deployed U.S. Park Police to act\njointly with the MPD in carrying out this unconstitutional disruption strategy. Additional\nother individual officers and outside agencies which have yet to be identified also\nengaged in the same joint action.\n169. The MPD maintains the policy, practice and/or custom of processing and treating\ndisparately those persons arrested for minor offenses in connection with political mass\narrests or round-ups. The disparate processing and treatment includes confinement for\nextended period of time including often overnight for alleged minor offenses, and the\nfailure to offer political mass arrestees the post and trial option.\n170. The above-referenced policies and customs, and also the failure to properly train its\nofficers, constitute deliberate indifference on the part of policymakers of the District of\nColumbia to the constitutional rights of protesters in the Nation's Capital, as well as all\nthose who would associate with such protesters or report on them as media.\n171. The actions of the above-referenced defendants violated the following clearly established\nand well settled federal constitutional rights:\na. Freedom from the unreasonable seizure of one's person;\nb. Freedom from government disruption of, interference with, or retaliation for,\nengagement in free speech, assembly, association, petition and free press\nactivities.\n172. The challenged actions and omissions constitute deliberate indifference on the part of the\n37\n\nCCaassee  11::0022--ccvv--0022228833--EEGGSS  -  J M DFo c  uDmoecnutm 2e1n5t   2  1 F6 il e  dF i0le7d/2 097/2/2090/50 5       PPaaggee  3388  ooff  4488(cid:10)\nDistrict of Columbia, the federal defendants and other defendants to the constitutional\nrights of protesters in the Nation's Capital.\n173. As a direct and proximate result of the acts or omissions of the defendants identified in\nthis complaint and the other unidentified agents and agencies acting jointly, each of the\nplaintiffs has suffered monetary and non-monetary harm including deprivation of\nconstitutional rights under the First, Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S.\nConstitution, loss of liberty, as well as physical harm, emotional pain and suffering.\nOngoing Injury to Plaintiffs\n174. Plaintiffs all suffer continued adverse and deterrent effects from the above-referenced\nconduct.\n175. Defendants' illegal conduct subjects protesters and observers and all those who associate\nwith protesters to unconstitutional obstacles to the exercise of their rights. There is an\nintended, ongoing and continued deterrent effect caused by defendant's conduct, in that\nprotesters and others must face the reasonable fear that merely by assembling and\nexercising their right to free speech (or to listen to speech), they will risk being subject to\nthe unlawful tactics of the MPD and federal law enforcement, the risk of false\nimprisonment and false arrest and preventive detention, as well as the exposure to force\nand the threatened use of force by officers working with the mobile police lines.\n176. Plaintiffs intend to, in the future, engage in or associate with First Amendment protected\nactivities in Washington, D.C. and seek injunctive relief to prevent future\nunconstitutional disruption.\n38\n\nCCaassee  11::0022--ccvv--0022228833--EEGGSS  -  J M DFo c  uDmoecnutm 2e1n5t   2  1 F6 il e  dF i0le7d/2 097/2/2090/50 5       PPaaggee  3399  ooff  4488(cid:10)\nCLAIMS\nCOUNT I\nFalse Arrests at Vermont Avenue\n(First Amendment; Fourth Amendment; False Imprisonment; Fourteenth Amendment)\n177.

Defendant MURPHY is expressly excluded from claims arising in connection with\nexisting Counts I through VI. The only claims asserted against MURPHY are those set\nforth in Claim VII herein.\n199. The allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 through 176 are incorporated by reference as if\nset forth herein.\n200. MURPHY became involved in these arrests at the request of the Metropolitan Police\nDepartment.\n201. MURPHY’s actions in deploying U.S. Park Police to disrupt and subject plaintiffs\nCANALES, DURHAM, FALK, JACKSON, GARCIA-SPITZ, CASEY LEGLER,\nCHARLCIE LEGLER, NORTON, PASSACANTANDO, PHELAN, PRICHARD, RESS,\n42\n\nCCaassee  11::0022--ccvv--0022228833--EEGGSS  -  J M DFo c  uDmoecnutm 2e1n5t   2  1 F6 il e  dF i0le7d/2 097/2/2090/50 5       PPaaggee  4433  ooff  4488(cid:10)\nSCOTT, WOHLBERG, WOOD, YOUNG AND ZIMMERMAN, and those SIMILARLY\nSITUATED IN THE CLASS, to false arrest violated the First and Fourth Amendment\nrights of those individuals seized.\n202. At no time did MURPHY even make an assessment as to whether probable cause existed\nto arrest the hundreds of class members in Pershing Park. MURPHY has testified that\n“[i]t was not my position to identify probable cause.”\n203. MURPHY knew that arrests for demonstrating without a permit violated protocol in the\nabsence of notice, opportunity to disperse and refusal to disperse. He turned a blind eye to\nthe unconstitutional and unlawful nature of the conduct in which he participated, and in\nwhich he ordered others to engage.\n204. MURPHY had no knowledge from which to objectively and reasonably believe that the\nhundreds of people inside Pershing Park had failed to obey an order. MURPHY did not\nknow even what specific order the class members ostensibly disobeyed, and he did not\nmake any inquiries either. He had no knowledge as to in whose presence such alleged\noffenses may have ostensibly been committed, and he made no inquiries to secure this\ninformation. \n205. MURPHY also knew that the composition of the group assembled or present inside the\npark was in flux, as he observed people coming and going into the park prior to the\nencirclement and arrest.\n206. It was objectively unreasonable for MURPHY to believe or claim that probable cause\nexisted to arrest the plaintiff class.\n207. Yet, MURPHY’s officers formed portions of a series of interconnected police lines that\n43\n\nCCaassee  11::0022--ccvv--0022228833--EEGGSS  -  J M DFo c  uDmoecnutm 2e1n5t   2  1 F6 il e  dF i0le7d/2 097/2/2090/50 5       PPaaggee  4444  ooff  4488(cid:10)\nsurrounded Pershing Park, deprived the plaintiff class of the freedom to leave and\neffected their mass arrest.\n208. MURPHY caused and participated in the unlawful and unconstitutional conduct\ncomplained of herein, specifically the false arrest of the Barham class and disruption of\nFirst Amendment protected activity.\n209. Independently, and in the alternative, MURPHY’s actions constituted deliberate\nindifference to the rights of the Barham class.\n210. In the alternative, MURPHY conspired with and/or engaged in joint action with the\nDistrict of Columbia, and with the encouragement of District officials who exercised the\ncoercive power of the District of Columbia through MURPHY in the execution of the\nfalse arrests and constitutional violations.\n211. MURPHY is sued for constitutional torts pursuant to Bivens and, in the alternate,\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for acting in concert with District officials to deprive the\nindividuals in the Barham class of their civil rights.\n212. As a direct and proximate result of the acts or omissions of MURPHY, the Barham class\nand its representatives have suffered monetary and non-monetary harm including the\ndeprivation of constitutional rights under the First and Fourth Amendments to the U.S.\nConstitution.”\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF\n213.

RAMSEY, et al. \nDefendants. \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n(First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment; False Arrest and \nImprisonment; Conversion; Negligence) \nOVERVIEW \n1.  On September 27,2002, the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department in joint action with \nfederal law enforcement agencies (and unidentified other local or federal agencies) once \nagain deployed its Civil Disturbance Units to disrupt political protest in the Nation's \nCapital; and to punish with unlawful detention and false arrest those who engaged in \nlawful civil dissent on this first day of a weekend of planned demonstrations, as well as \nthose interested non-protesters or political sympathizers who approached the \ndemonstrations to hear the political message or engage in political discussion. \n2.  The F.B.I. used these mass arrests as a mass intelligence gathering operation. Working in \n2 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 16    Filed 02/07/03   Page 3 of 46\n\\/  conjunction with federal law enforcement agencies, including the F.B.I., the D.C. police \ndepartment compelled identification information from those it falsely arrested as a \ncondition of the arrest, confinement and release. The F.B.I. and other local and federal \nlaw enforcement agencies collected intelligence and identification information on lawful \npolitical activists, their activities, and others who associated with or were in proximately \nto the demonstrations. \n3.  This lawsuit challenges what have become systematized mechanisms of government \ndisruption of free speech and assembly to criminaIize dissent, and in particular the tactics, \ndeployment, and use of Civil Disturbance Units by the D.C. Metropolitan Police \nDepartment acting in conjunction with federal and other law enforcement authorities, \nagainst peaceful protesters. These units, as a matter of practice and policy, employ \nunconstitutional tactics to disturb, disrupt, infringe upon and criminalize constitutionally \n. protected speech and assembly. \n4.  This complaint is the most recent in a series oflawsuits with a shared factual allegation: \nThat the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department's Civil Disturbance Units maintain and \nexecute unconstitutional tactics to disrupt lawful protest and assembly including \nspecifically the routine use of mobile police lines to interfere with freedom of association, \nassembly, speech and free movement; and the use of administrative detention, false \nimprisonment and false arrest tactics in which the CDUs will trap protesters (and others \nin physical proximity) on all sides, seize, detain and arrest those trapped/seized in the \nabsence of probable cause. These actions are accomplished through the use of \nparamilitary force and threat of force in order to deprive, interfere with, and deter the \n3 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 16    Filed 02/07/03   Page 4 of 46\nexercise of constitutionally protected rights \n5.  The earliest filed now-pending case alleging the existence oft hese unconstitutional \ndisruption strategies and tactics is International Action Center, et al. v. USA, et al., CA \n01-00072, which arose out of the deployment of these tactics during the Bush \nInaugnration demonstrations in January, 2001. The existence of these tactics was also \nalleged in the subsequently filed litigation 50 Years is Enough. et al. v. District of \nColumbia, et al., CA 01-00811, which arose out of the deployment oft hese tactics during \nthe April, 2000 International Monetary Fund protests. \n6.  At each of these demonstrations, the D.C. MPD actions have been coordinated and \nc \nexecuted in conjunction with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, among other U.S. \nagenCIes. \n7.  The conduct challenged herein is neither aberrational nor the consequence of overzealous \nbut well intentioned law enforcement. It was the implementation of a pre-designed plan to \nengage in unconstitutional preemptive arrests intended to round-up political activists and \nlock them up in the absence of probable cause. U.S. Capitol Police Chief Terrance \nCC \nGainer testified -- before the protests - -that he and D.C. police had discussed \npreemptive action against protesters. \n8.  When one plaintiff asked why she was being arrested and whether she could please go \nfree, one officer candidly explained that she was being arrested because she was \ndisplaying political \"propaganda.\" Others. were let out apparently based on their perceived \nloyalty to the government. The Washington Post reported that police lines yielded for at \nleast one detainee when he displayed a Department of Justice identification card. \n4 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 16    Filed 02/07/03   Page 5 of 46\n9.  This complaint additionally alleges that police treat and process those (falsely) arrested in \nconnection with targeted mass political activity differently from 1ihose who are arrested \nfor other minor offenses. Plaintiffs were subjected to more harsh treatment in custody and \nwere hogtied wrist-to-ankle for hours. They were subjected to intentional sleep \ndeprivation and were not released in a matter of hours as would normally be the case, but, \nwere held into the night and overnight, for up to 30 hours. The purpose of these arrests \nwas not to enforce laws, but to take protesters off of the streets on the first day of a \nweekend of plamied political events. \n10.  The District of Columbia maintains a policy, practice andlor custom of denying to those \narrested in targeted mass political round-ups the option to be released and \"post and trial.\" \nThis option allows an arrestee to be quickly released from jailor custody by posting \ncollateral and receiving a trial date on which to challenge the legality of the arrest. The \nMPD is advising persons caught in targeted mass political sweeps that they must remain \nin jailor police custody for an extended period of time or may secure release only by \n\"post andforfeit,\" which means the arrestee forfeits the collateral and does not receive the \nopportunity to challenge the legality of the arrest. This disparate treatment, disallowing \nthe post and trial option in the case of political round-ups, denies those arrestees equal \nprotection under the law, and also subjects those who wish to challenge the legality of \ntheir arrest to greater pre-arraigrunent jail or police custody simply because they seek to \nexercise their constitutional right to defend against an unlawful arrest. \n11.  Federal agencies coordinate with the MPD in connection with mass political arrests for, \namong other reasons, using the arrests to collect photographs, fingerprints and other \n/  5 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 16    Filed 02/07/03   Page 6 of 46\ninformation about politi~al activists an.d their assbCiations. The Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, among other unidentified federal agencies, collects such data and places it. \nin information databases and, on information and belief, disseminates and makes such \npersonal information available to other entities. \n12.  Those who are forCibly arrested and deprived of their liberty suffer great fear, harm, and \npersonal rrgury. The stigma of having been arrested carries on beyond the innnediate \npersonal and physical consequences of the deprivation ofliberty. The collection and \ndissemination of personal information and political associations effects an invasion and \nloss of privacy, as well as a profound loss of Constitutional right to be protected when \nengaging in or·associating with First Amendment protected activity. \n13.  These round-ups and mass arrests of political activists are anathema to democracy. It is \nnot merely remarkable that such round-ups happen repeatedly in Washington, D.C., but \nthat policy makers emphatically ratifY such,blatantly unconstitutional tactics. \n14.  \"Ain't it a thing of beauty,\" Chief Ramsey stated on September 27,2002, as he reviewed \nthe officers about to mass arrest hundreds in Pershing Park, \"to see our folks up there \nready to go.\" \n. 15.  These challenged police actions create a substantial chilling effect and deterrent to future \nFirst Amendment protected activity as the exercise of on,e's political rights in \nWashington, D.C. now carries with it the risk of arrest, of being wrongfully subject to the \ncriminal process of the state, of being threatened with physical harm by the police, being \nbound with handcuffs, having one's identification and political activities be collected and \nrecorded - - for no reason other than having political associations that have been targeted \n6 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 16    Filed 02/07/03   Page 7 of 46\nby the federal government or by the local chief of police or mayor. \n16.  This complaint seeks, in addition to monetary compensation, injunctive relief enjoining \ndefendants from engaging in the challenged conduct in the future. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n17.  This Court has jurisdiction to hear this complaint pursuantto 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal \nquestion), 28 U.s.C. § 1343(a)(3) and (4) (civil rights jurisdiction), and 28 U.S.C. § 1367 \n(supplemental jurisdiction). \n18.  Venue is appropriately vested in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391, as the District \nof Columbia is a judicial district in which all defendants reside, and, independently \nbecause a substantial part of the acts or omissions giving rise to the claims herein \noccurred in,the District of Columbia. \nPARTIES \n19.

As a matter of policy, practice and custC)m, the MPD injoint action with federal and other \nagencies, intentionally disrupts and disperses certain targeted mass political assembly and \ndemonstrations in the absence of cause or justification. \n51.  As a matter of practice, custom, and informal policy the MPD routinely violates its own \n16 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 16    Filed 02/07/03   Page 17 of 46\nestablished standards and engages in constitutionally impermissible mass arrests and \n, \npolitical ronnd-ups of targeted political demonstrators and activists engaged in mass \nassembly and political activity and others associating with them. \n52.  The MPD has issued the \"Metropolitan Police Department Handbook for the \nManagement of Mass Demonstrations\" (hereinafter the \"Mass Demonstration \nHandbook\"). According to the MPD, the Mass Demonstration Handbook is the standard \noperational guide for dealing with mass demonstrations, and the handbook establishes \nwhat the MPD claims to be proper standards, procedures and MPD obligations in that \ncontext. \n53.  According to the MPD Mass Demonstration Handbook, where police intend to disperse a \ncrowd engaging in a political demonstration, the field commander shall instruct unit \ncommanders \"to issue warnings to the crowd to disperse.\" \n54.  The MPD Mass Demonstration Handbook requires as follows: \n[A] [1]  The issuance of warnings shall be of such amplification and repetition as to be \nheard by the entire assemblage. \n[2]  Issuances shall be made by the unit commander from stationary vantage points \nwhich are observable to the crowd, or to a large number of participants. \n[3]  Additional warnings, where necessary, shall be given from police vehicles, \nequipped with public address systems, moving aronnd the crowd. \n[4]  The warning shall consist of an annonncement citing the offenses or violations \nwhich are being committed by participants and a request or order, whichever is \napplicable, that the crowd disperse. Whenever possible, this warning Shall be \nwritten out prior to annonncement, to ensure clarity and accuracy, and \nconsistency, ift he warning is repeated.  -, \n[5]  The entire warning process shall be documented by means of an audio-visual \nrecording, if available. \n[B]  As a first means of dispersing a crowd nnder static conditions, the unit \ncommander shall attempt to verbally persuade the crowd to disperse of its own \naccord by annonnced available exit routes. \n[C][I] If, after a reasonable time following the initial warning, the crowd refuses to \n17 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 16    Filed 02/07/03   Page 18 of 46\ndisperse, the unit commander shall issue a final warning ordering the participants \nto disperse or be subject to arrest. \n[2] ,  If, after a reasonable amount of time following the final warning, the crowd \ncontinues in its refusal to disperse, the unit commander shall direct that violators \nbe arrested. \n55.  None of the plaintiffs were afforded benefit or protection of the standards described \nabove in the MPD-issued Mass Demonstration Handbook. The MPD violated these \nstandards with respect to plaintiffs and hundreds of others. \nTHE DEFENDANTS' PLAN FOR \nPOLITICAL ROUNDUPS AND \"PREEMPTIVE\" ARRESTS \n56.  The MPD and other defendants had advance knowledge that there was planned a \nweekend of political demonstration activity beginning on Friday, September 27, 2002. \n57.  Federal and local law enforcement agencies discussed and planned in advance a strategy \nof \"preemptive\" action against protesters, as was reported in the Saturday, September 21, \n2002 Washington Post. \n58.  Capitol Police Chief Terrance W. Gainer participated in these discnssions with D.C. and \nfederal law enforcement officials. Treating the protesters as presumptively criminal, and \nindicating a willingness to act absent probable canse, Gainer explained, \"I don't know \nwhy we have to wait until after they've inflicted damage.\" \n59.  The local and federal plan was, in fact, implemented on September 27,2002. As \nevidenced by its implementation, the plan consisted of political round-ups at multiple \nlocations and mass arrests of hundreds of peaceful protesters and any others in their \nvicinity with no regard as to whether such persons were, in fact, breaking any law. \n. 60.  On September 27, 2002 District officials made it a crime to be a protester in Washington, \nD.C., and a crime for others to come near to hear the protesters' message or to join in. \n18 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 16    Filed 02/07/03   Page 19 of 46\n~, \nI  : \n,,-~ \nFACTS RELATED TO THE ROUND-UPS NEAR FRANKLIN SQUARE PARK \n61.  On the morning of September 27, 2002 a political assembly of approximately 200 - 300 \npersons gathered in the area of Franklin Square Park. \n62.  By approximately 6 -7 a.m. there was a substantial police presence in the area because of \nthe anticipated assemblage. \n63.  Plaintiff McATEER, who was age seventeen at the time, came to the area as an \nindependent journalist. McATEER was intending to videotape the anticipated political \nevents for publication through the Independent Media Center or other press outlets. \n64.  McATEER had not even reached Franklin Park when he was detained by an MPD officer, \nwho demanded to know \"Are you going to the protest?\" The officer searched \nMcATEER's backpack before ultimately releasing him. There was no cause for searching \nMcATEER's belongings, and he expressly stated that he did not consent to the search of \nhis belongings. \n65.  Plaintiff SALIGMAN is a bicycle racer. She had been riding her bicycle as part of her \nroutine racing and fitness training. At the end of her training ride when she saw some \ndemonstrators who were peaceably walking onto the block together, she paused her bike \nfor the purpose of observing their political activities. Without notice or warning, a police \n, \nline popped up. Observing this line forming, Ms. SALIGMAN decided to move on so she \ncould shower and go to work. Without any warning, without even an order to \"move \nback,\" a police officer violently pushed her and knocked her off of her bicycle. The police \ngrabbed herby the scruff of her neck and said \"we're taking you in,\" and arrested her. \n66.  Plaintiffs BARHAM, LEHACH and SWANSON went to the Franklin Park area in their \n19 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 16    Filed 02/07/03   Page 20 of 46\n• \ncapacities as National Lawyers Guild Legal Observers. Such legal observers are routinely \nat the site of political assemblages and demonstrations for the purpose of observing \nevents, including police misconduct. \n67.  Plaintiffs BARHAM, LEHACH and SWANSON were clearly identified as Legal \nObservers and each wore a high-visibili~ green flourescent baseball cap and a green \nidentification tag that identified each as a Legal Observer. \n68.  On this morning, a group of protesters moved from Franklin Park along K Street and one \nblock north alQng Vermont Avenue. \n, 69.  The MPD erected a police line at the intersection of Vermont and L \"Streets, blocking \nnorthbound passage. \n70.  The MPD then erected a police line at the intersection of Vermont and K Streets, \nblocking southbound passage. \n71.  Movement eastbound and westbound was also blocked by police and/or buildings. \n72.  Police used force and/or threat of force to impede movement outside of this area. \n73.  The area within the police lines became a detention zone, within which scores of \ndemonstrators, observers, and bystanders were thus seized and arrested within the \nmeaning of the 4th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, without probable \ncause. \n74.  Plaintiffs BARHAM, LEHACH, MCATEER and SWANSON were boxed-in by the \npolice lines and had no avenue to exit the scene. \n75.  The police issued no directives other than to \"move back\" -a directive that was often \n. issued simultaneously with a blow from a baton. \n20 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 16    Filed 02/07/03   Page 21 of 46\n76.  Riot police used their batons offensively and aggressively, yelling at protesters to \"move \nback.\" Police crammed the detainees into a smaller and smaller area, closing their \nperimeter with force and violence. This created an atmosphere of increasing fear, \nprovocation and tension. \n77.  At one point, a storefront window broke and shattered when the police, wielding their \nbatons offensively, pushed a trapped and tightly compressed group of arrestees into the \nwindow. The police had ignored the arrestees' pleas to stop the compression. \n78.  At no time did plaintiffs BARHAM, LEHACH, McATEER or SWANSON fail to obey a \npolice order. \n79.  After surrounding plaintiffs BARHAM, LEHACH, McATEER and SWANSON with \npolice lines, the police then without probable cause or lawful justification, arrested \nBARHAM, LEHACH, McATEER and SWANSON along with hundreds of others, \nmostly political activists and demonstrators. \n80.  An MPD officer approached Plaintiff BARHAM, who was wearing legal observer \nidentification. The officer asked ifB ARHAM was a law student and then threatened \nBARHAM that his arrest should prevent him from being admitted to the bar. \n81.  At no point did any MPD officer do any of the following, as is required by the MPD Mass \nDemonstration Handbook: \n1.  issue a warning for the political demonstration or for others in proximity to the \npolitical assemblage to disperse; \n2.  issue any warnings to disperse through the use of amplification and with such \nrepetition for the entire assemblage to hear; \n3.  issue any warning to disperse from stationary vantage points observable to the \n21 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 16    Filed 02/07/03   Page 22 of 46\n, \ncrowd or to a large number of participants; \n4.  issue additional warnings given from police vehicles, equipped with public \naddress systems, moving about the crowd. \n5.  make an announcement citing the offenses or violations which were allegedly \nbeing committed and issue a request or order that individuals disperse. \n82.  The MPD prevented dispersal through the actual and threatened use offorce, and through \nunyielding police lines. \n83.  At no time was there probable cause to arrest plaintiffs BARHAM, LEHACH, \nMcATEER, SALIGMAN or SWANSON. \n84.  This unconstitutional mass arrest and round-up was directed and approved by D.C. and \nl\\.!PD policy,makers. MPD policy makers and high-ranking officials present during the \nmass arrest included Chief of Police Charles Ramsey, Sgt. Joseph Gentile, and Lt. Jeffrey \nHerold, among others. \nFACTS RELATING TO THE ROUND-UPS OF PERSONS LAWFULLY RIDING \nBICYCLES IN SUPPORT OF ALTERNATIVES TO FOSSIL FUEL USAGE \n85.  On September 27, 2002 approximately sixty to seventy persons met at Uuion Station for \nthe purpose of engaging in a lawful bicycle ride and to demonstrate, by way of example, \ntheir support for alternatives to oil and gasoline consumption and the pollution caused by \nsuch fuels. \n86.  By law and regulation, bicycles are allowed to traverse the roadways in the District of \nColumbia. \n87.  At approximately 8:30 a.m. on September 27, 2002 plaintiffs JORGE GARCIA-SPITZ, \nCASEY LEGLER, CHARLCIE LEGLER, and SAMANTHA YOUNG met at Duion \n22 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 16    Filed 02/07/03   Page 23 of 46\nStation. Ms. DEVON YATES also assembled with others at Union ~tation. \n88.  It was the intention of plaintiffs GARCIA-SPITZ, LEGLER, LEGLER and YOUNG to \nembark upon this lawful bicycle ride from Union Station over to the Freedom Plaza area, \nwhere they understood a political demonstration was to take place, and from there to go \ntheir separate ways, to work or school or elsewhere. Plaintiff YATES intended to embark \non the bike ride and later that day participate in political demonstration activity, where \nshe intended to dress as an oil slick to further convey her support for non-fossil fuel \nenergy and the risks associated with reliance upon oil. \n89.  The police were aware of this well publicized bike ride, and they maintained a substantial \npresence. in the vicinity of Union Station. \n90.  At approximately 8:30a.m., the bicyclists began their ride. None of the law enforcement \nofficers directed the bike riders to not ride their bikes, and the police did not obstruct the \nstart of this lawful and political endeavor. \n91.  As soon as the bike ride started, however, mobile police lines popped up - - consisting of \nofficers on bicycles and on motorcycles and in motor vehicles - - surrounding these \nplaintiffs and the bicyclists on all sides. \n92.  By virtue of their police lines, the police controlled the movement of the bicyclists. When \npolice wanted to stop the bicyclists, the front line of officers would wave and direct that \nthdse-following behind them should stop. Those who sought to leave the bike ride by \nexiting through the side mobile police lines would be prevented from doing so. In this \nregard, the bicyclists were already seized by the police as they were riding in a mobile \ndetention zone. However, the presence of the mobile police lirieswas interpreted by some \n23 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 16    Filed 02/07/03   Page 24 of 46\nas an escort and it did not interfere with plaintiffs GARCIA-SPITZ, LEGLER, LEGLER, \nYATES and YOUNG's original and lawful intention to traverse the roadways peaceably \nand lawfully upon their bikes. \n93.  The bicyclists obeyed all traffic laws during this bike ride, including obeying all \ndirectives from the police. \n94.  There was no attempt by the police to obstruct the bike ride as it proceeded, nor did the \npolice suggest that there was even any problem. Some of the cyclists even misinterpreted \nthe police escort as a measure of support or success. \n95.  As the bike ride entered its final leg near the Freedom Plaza and Pershing Park area the \ncyclists were confronted by a stationary police line in their way. \n96.  The police forced the bicyclists into Pershing Park which is across from Freedom Plaza \nand which held about 300 demonstrators at that time. The police ordered them off of their \nbicycles. The cyclists complied, as this was about where they intended to terminate their \nride, and many initially thought there was nothing wrong. \n97.  However, a few minutes later when plaintiffs CASEY LEGLER and her partner \nSAMANTHA YOUNG attempted to leave Pershing Park because they had to go to work \nlater that day, they were told by the police that \"no one is allowed to leave the park.\" \n98.  The police had surrounded these plaintiffs and the park, using police lines that had \npopped up on all sides, and refused to let anyone leave the parle \n99.  One officer told CASEY LEGLER and YOUNG that they were not allowed to leave \nbecause their bikes were displaying \"propaganda.  The officer told them that they could \nn \nleave if they removed the propaganda, which consisted in part of a sign displaying a \n24 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 16    Filed 02/07/03   Page 25 of 46\nwomen's symbol. They complied with the officer's request removing their First \nAmendment protected materials. The officer took their signs and destroyed them, and \nthen continued to refuse to let them leave. \n100.  CASEY LEGLER and YOUNG approached an MPD Lieutenant and asked why they \nwere not being allowed to leave and if they were being arrested. \n101.  The Lieutenant advised that \"At this point in time Ma'am, we are just following orders.\" \n102.  Ms. YATES was sitting on the grass in the park lawfully sewing her oil slick costume \nwhen she realized that she, too, was surrounded on all sides by the police. \n103.  The defendants refused to allow plaintiffs GARCIA-SPITZ, LEGLER, LEGLER, YATES \nand YOUNG to disperse or leave the park and subsequently falsely arrested each in the \nmanner described below. \nFACTS RELATING TO THE ROUND-UPS OF PERSONS IN PERSIDNG PARK \n104.  Demonstrators began gathering in parkland near the intersection of 14th Street and \n, \nPennsylvania Avenue, NW, between approximately 8:00 - 9:00 am. on September 27, \n2002. \n105.  Demonstrators had planned to engage to protest in Freedom Plaza, which is adjacent to \nPershing Park. However, police officers directed demonstrators into Pershing Park and \nthe political assemblage gathered there. \n106.  Pershing Park is a public forum under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of \nthe mterior, National Park Service. \n107.  Plaintiffs MARY CANALES and SALLY NORTON are each registered nurses who were \nin Washington, D.C. for the purpose of attending a nursing conference, \"Advancing \n25 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 16    Filed 02/07/03   Page 26 of 46\nNursing Practice Excellence: State of the science,\" which was being held at the Marriott \nHotel that is near Pershing Park. \n108.  Drs. CANALES and NORTON decided to leave the Marriott Hotel to get breakfast, \nwhich they did at approximately 8:30 a.m. They were aware, from news reports, that there \nwere demonstrations anticipated in Washington, D.C. that day, and they saw that \ndemonstrators were gathered at Pershing Park. After picking up coffee, they entered the \npark in order to listen to any political speakers that might be giving a speech there. \n109.  There was an evident police presence, but no indication to Doctors CANALES or \nNORTON that there was a problem. They passed by the police and entered without event. \n110.  At about the same time, plaintiff JERIWOHLBERG, a graduate student in nursing who \nwas presenting research at the conference at the Marriott, ·decided that she wanted to \nparticipate in the demonstration in Pershing Park. She knew of the demonstration from \nthe media coverage and wished to support its political message. She could hear and see \nthe demonstration from the Marriott. She, too, entered the park passing by the police who \nwere not indicating any imminent police round-up or similar problem. Ms. WOHLBERG \nmet up with plaintiffs CANALES and NORTON in the park. \nIll.  Plaintiffs WOHLBERG, CANALES and NORTON all observed what was occurring in \nPershing park at that time, just before the mass arrest and political round-up: dancing, \nsinging and assembly. Some people were rhythmically beating drums. ManYllrotesters \nheld signs protesting corporate globalization and greed. Other signs advocated for peace, \nagainst war in Iraq, and bore messages such as \"bread not bombs.\" Clearly it was a \ngathering of individuals engaging in political speech, assembly and camaraderie. \n26 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 16    Filed 02/07/03   Page 27 of 46\n112.  At a time between 9:00 am.. and 9:30 a.m., the bicyclists were forced into the Park, and \nshortly thereafter police lines were erected without any notice or warning. Many of those \nsurrounded had no inunediate awareness that they had been trapped and seized. \n113.  A session of the nursing conference was set to begin at 9:45 a.m. CANALES, NORTON \nand WOHLBERG found, however, that they had been surrounded by these police lines \nthat had silently popped up on all sides. They found unyielding police lines in every \ndirection, with many officers in intimidating, black, full riot gear. They attempted to leave \nand asked permission to leave of no less than five separate officers. They explained they \nhad to attend the conference, and displayed their conference tote bags. \n114.  This was similar to the experiences that other plaintiffs who happened also to be in the \n. park were having. \n115.  PlaintiffWILLlAM DURHAM went to Pershing Park as a protester. He arrived at the \npark, and observed a drum circle there with people cheering and chanting. Soon \nthereafter, he and. others realized that police lines had popped up on all sides. The police \nrefused to allow DURHAM to leave. \n116.  Plaintiff NOAH F ALK is a law student at the George Washington University School of \nLaw. He was in Pershing Park in his capacity as a National Lawyers Guild Legal \nObserver, and was clearly identifiable as such based on the flourescent green Legal \nObserver cap and green badge he was displaying. F ALK was lawfully standing in the park \nwhen he found himself surrounded by police lines. \n117.  Plaintiff MARK JACKSON is an independent contractor with the Underground Railroad \nand Freedom Center, and works with a curator at the American History Museum. He was \n27 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 16    Filed 02/07/03   Page 28 of 46\nnot protesting, but had walked over to the park and planned to head to work when he \nfound himself surrounded by police lines that had quietly popped up. He asked to be \nallowed past the police line, but the police refused him passage, explaining \"we can't let \nyou out.\" \n118.  Plaintiff JOHN P ASSACANTA  NDO had been riding his bicycle to. work that morning to \navoid what had been predicted to be difficult traffic. He stopped near Pershing Park to \nobserve the protest. Thereafter he, too, found himself surrounded by police lines on all \nsides with police refusing to let him leave. PASSACANTA  NDO asked no less than a \ndozen officers at different locations to be allowed to leave and go on his way, but he was \ntold repeatedly that he was not allowed to leave. A number of the officers advised that \nthey were acting under \"orders.\" \n119.  PlaintiffJOSEPH PHELAN is a student at Hunter College in New York, and was present \nin Pershing Park to participate in the protests.  When he sought to leave the park, MPD \nofficers told him he could not leave.  He asked one officer ~A  m I being detained\" and was \ntold \"no.\" When he then said, \"So we can leave,\" the officer stated \"If you try to leave, \nyou'll be arrested.\" \n120.  PlaintiffNlCOLE PRICHARD was riding her bicycle around the City when she found \nherself amidst the group of protesters on bicycles.  She was almost immediately thereafter \nforced into Pershing Park, where she found herself surrounded by police lines on all sides \nand, when she sought to leave, was told by an MPD officer \"no one goes in and no one \ngoes out unless{)n that [mass arrest] bus.\" \n121.  Plaintiff MORGAN RESS is an artist who works with ABC No Rio, an artist space on \n28 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 16    Filed 02/07/03   Page 29 of 46\n, \nthe lower east side of Manhattan, NY. RESS Was in Pershing Park as a demonstrator and \nas a photographer and artist. He heard the. sound of protest drums in the park, entered the \npark, and soon found that the police had formed lines around the park. He asked multiple \nofficers ifhe could please leave, and each refused to let him go. Some officers were \nsilent, others told him to go to another police line. When he did so he would either be . \ndirected to go to yet another police line or would be met with silence. One officer \nexplained, \"Our orders are no one leaves the park.\" \n122.  Plaintiff MACDONALD SCOTT is employed as the Membership Coordinator for the \nNational Lawyers Guild in New York City. He was peacefully protesting in the park \nwhen he found himself surrounded on all sides by police lines.  He requested of at least \nfive police officers that they allow him to leave the park, and each time was refused. \n123.  Plaintiff LESLEY WOOD is a doctoral candidate at Columbia University. She was \npeacefully protesting in Pershing Park when without notice or warning the police formed \nlines around the park.  She requested of at least five police officers that they allow her to \nleave the park, and each time was refused. \n124.  Plaintiff STEPHEN ZIMMERMAN is a law student at GC<?rge Washington University \nLaw School and was a National Lawyers Guild Legal Observer present in Pershing Park \nwhen police surrounded the park. He tried to leave, but was not allowed. \n125.  At no time did any of plaintiffs CANALES, DURHAM, F ALK, GARCIA-SPITZ, \nJACKSON, LEGLER, LEGLER, NORTON, PASSACANTANDO, PHELAN, \nPRICHARD, RESS, SCOTT, WOHLBERG, WOOD, YATES, YOUNG, or \nZIMMERMAN fail to obey a police order. \n29 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 16    Filed 02/07/03   Page 30 of 46\n126.  The police actions in the vicinity of PersHing Piitk were executed by MPD police, u.s. \nPark Police under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior, and other as-yet-\nunidentified law enforcement agencies and officers. \n127.  After surrounding plaintiffs CANALES, DURHAM, FA  LI<, GARCIA-SPITZ, \nJACKSON, LEGLER, LEGLER, NORTON, PASSACANTANDO, PHELAN, \nPRICHARD, RESS, SCOTT, WOHLBERG, WOOD, YATES, YOUNG and \nZIMMERMAN with police lines, the police then without probable cause or lawful \njustification, arrested each of them along with hundreds of others, mostly political \nactivists and demonstrators. \n128.  At no point did any MPD officer do any of the following, as is required by the MPD Mass \nDemonstration Handbook: \n1.  issue a warning for the political demonstration or for others in proximity to the \npolitical assemblage to disperse; \n2.  ,issue any warnings to disperse through the use of amplification and with such \nrepetition for the entire assemblage to hear; \n3.  issue any warning to disperse from stationary vantage points observable to the \ncrowd or to a large number of participants; \n4.  issue additional wamings given from police vehicles, equipped with pUblic \naddress systems, moving about the crowd. \n5.  make an announcement citing the offenses or violations which were allegedly \nbeing committed and issue a request or order that individuals disperse. \n129.  The MPD and other police prevented dispersal through the actual and threatened use of \nforce, and through unyielding police lines. \n130.  At no time was there probable cause to arrest any of plaintiffs CANALES, DURHAM, \n30 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 16    Filed 02/07/03   Page 31 of 46\nF ALK, GARCIA-SPITZ, JACKSON, LEGLER, LEGLER, NORTON, \nPASSACANTANDO, PHELAN, PRICHARD, RESS, SCOTT, WOHLBERG, WOOD, \nYATES, YOUNG or ZIMMERMAN. \n131.  The police used pop up police lines to unlawfully seize and detain hundreds of political \nactivists and those who associated with them or wer~ within physical proximity of their \npolitical assemblage. The police then executed a new phase of the police plan. \n132.  . Riot police used their batons offensively and aggressively, yelling at protesters to \"move \nin, move in!\" and telling them \"You cannot leave, move, move!\" Police crannned the \ndetainees into a smaller and smaller area, closing their perimeter with force and violence. \nThis created an atmosphere of increasing fear, provocation and tension. \n133.  It appeared to some that the police were trying to provoke a violent reaction from those \nthey were abusing. \n134.  Protesters responded by yelling at each other \"Do what they say!\" and \"Cover your head!\" \n135.  Police continued pushing protesters with violence and force. At points the perimeter was \ncollapsing inward with such a fierce pace that different officers were ordering people to \nmove in different directions.  \n. 136.  All of the plaintiffs obeyed the police's unlawful orders. \n137.  The arrestees were tightly compacted in the Southwest comer of the Park. \n138.  Small groups ofMPD officers began a process of crossing the police line, grabbing an \nindividual, dragging that individual to the outside of the police line, violently throwing \nhim or her face down to the ground, using three of four officers to exert force upon the \nnon-resisting arrestee, handcuffing him or her, and placing him or her on a bus. \n31 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 16    Filed 02/07/03   Page 32 of 46\n, \n139.  This happened to the first four or five people hi a row, until the most violent officers were \nrestrained by other officers and told to calm down. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n(proposed class to encompass those falsely arrested in Pershing Park) \n140.  The proposed class is: All persons who were arrested on September 27, 2002 as part of \nthe mass arrests of persons that took place in Pershing Park. \n141.  The proposed class and their claims, satisfY the requirements of Rules 23(a ) and (b )(3). \n142.  The class of persons subject to the mass arrest in Pershing Park on September 27, 2002, \nwhich is composed of more than 400 persons, is too numerous for joinder. \n143.  These individuals' claims that their First, Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights and \ntheir common law rights against false arrest and false imprisonment were violated raise \n\\ \ncommon questions oflaw and fact. \n144.  By arresting virtually all of the participants in, and onlookers at, a peaceful political \nassemblage without probable cause or lawful justification, defendants acted ort grounds \ngenerally applicable to the class. \n145.  According to Peter Lavalee, .the D.C. Corporation Counsel's communication director as \nquoted in the Washington City Paper, \"We no-papered everything in Pershing Park. We \ndid not feel in the cases that came from Pershing Park - that the witness statements and \nthe evidence that we had [presented] probable cause that a crime was committed and/or \nthat a specific individual committed a crime. \n\"I \nJason Cherkis, \"Boss Hogtie: Police Chief Charles Ramsey had a plan for the more than \n1 \n400 people in Pershing Park last September: Arrest them all, detain them for hours, and then tie \nthem wrist to ankle for 12 hours. He says he'll do it again,\" The Washington City Paper, January \n17-23,2003 at 20,23.  .  , \n32 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 16    Filed 02/07/03   Page 33 of 46\n146.  The claims of the named plaintiffs are typical of the claims of this class, as they were \nlawfully present in Pershing Park when they were arrested without basis on April 15 as \npart of the same police sweep. \n147.  The named plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the members of \nthis class. \nFACTS COMMON TO THE PROCESSING OF ALL PLAINTIFFS \n148.·  The plastic handcuffs placed on many individuals were excessively tight.  All plaintiffs \nexperienced pain, and many experienced swelling and numbness from the handcuffs. \n149.  Arrested individuals were held on busses for many hours, with their hands handcuffed \nbehind their backs. \n150.  Sequential busloads of arrested individuals were eventually taken off the bus and brought \ninto the gymnasium of the Institute for Police Science at Blue Plains.  They were then \nshackled and hog-tied with their right wrists handcuffed to their left ankles.  Some were \nleft in this position for many hours. \n151.  Inside the gymnasium, law enforcement officials photographed the individuals arrested. \nPhotographs were taken of some arrestees that were in addition to their \"mug shots.\" \nSome demonstrators with political statements on their clothing were singled out and \nphotographed with greater scrutiny. \n152.  The Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, whose agents \nsometimes displayed FBI identification, participated in this mass collection of data. This \ndata has been recorded and collected in databases, record-keeping or other information \n33 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 16    Filed 02/07/03   Page 34 of 46\nsystems and, on information and belief, has also been disseminated or made available to \nunknown agencies and entities. \n153.  The MPD maintains a policy, practice or custom of treating persons arrested in \nconnection with mass political arrests differently than others who have been arrested for \nsimilar minor offenses. \n154.  The MPD maintains a policy, practice and custom of preventive detention for targeted \npersons or groups engaged in political activity. By way of example, documents secured \nthrough subpoena in International Action Center, et al. v. U.S.A., et al. include \nproduction notfs for an MPD training video related to mass demonstrations, in which the \nsection on \"Police Tactics and Issues\". includes \"Tactics -Locking up the troublemakers \non the first night.\" \n155.  The MPD maintains a policy, practice and custom of holding targeted political arrestees \n. who have been (falsely) charged only with minor offenses for extended periods of time, in \norder to take them off of the streets and prevent them from engaging in further political \ndissent on subsequent days of demonstration, and to induce fatigue through sleep \ndeprivation. By way of example, documents secured through subpoena in International \n. Action Center. et al. v. United States of America, et al. include production notes for an \nMPD training video related to mass demonstrations, in which the section on \"Police \nTactics and Issues\" includes \"Tactics - Sleep deprivation tactics.\" \n156.  The MPD ordinarily allows qualified persons to \"post and trial\" -- which means that the \narrestee can post collateral in order to secure prompt release and can retnm for a fUtnre \ntrial date on which the arrestee may challenge the legality of her arrest. \n34 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 16    Filed 02/07/03   Page 35 of 46\n157.  However, similarly situated persons as part of a mass political arrests or roundups are \nrefused this option, to \"post and trial.\" Instead, it is the policy, practice and/or custom of \nthe MPD that targeted political arrestees are offered only the option to \"post and forfeit\" \ncollateral. Police advise targeted political arrestees that, should they opt to challenge the \nlegality of their arrest, they will not be released for an extended period of days. The \nperiod of threatened additional confinement and jail ranges arbitrarily from between two \ndays to a week or more. \n158.  Plaintiffs were confined by defendants into the middle of the night or until the following \nday, for approximate periods of time ranging from no less than 14 hours to over 30 hours. \nUnconstitutional Policies of the MPD \n159.  The MPD, and those federal agencies which act jointly with the MPD and its \"Civil \nDistnrbance Units,\" maintain the policy, practice and/or custom of abusing their state \nauthority to distnrb and disrupt targeted civil political assembly and mass demonstrations. \n160.  The CDUs also accomplish their disruption strategy through their established practice and \npolicy of preventive detention of political activists, in which the CDUs will trap, seize \nand arrest groups of protesters by closing off all avenues of exit with riot gear clad police. \n·161.  The MPD and its CDUs maintain the policy, practice and/or custom of deploying police \n. lines where circumstances do not justifY such deployment and for the purpose of \ndisrupting First Amendment protected assembly, speech and petition activities. \n162.  These riot squads use force and the threat of force to enforce this preventive detention, in \nwhich they arrest and hold detainees for a significant period of time. Absent intervening \ncircumstances, the detainees will be placed on mass arrest busses and held for significant \n35 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 16    Filed 02/07/03   Page 36 of 46\nperiods of time, typically overnight. \n163.  Preventive detention signifies that individuals are being arrested not for engaging in \nillegal activity but for engaging in political activity, and constitutes a severe violation of \nFirst and Fourth Amendment rights when applied against political demonstrators. \n164.  The use of disruption and disturbance tactics by the MPD is an established custom, policy \nand practice oft he MPD, as evidenced by the repeated use, the approval of, and the \nacquiescence in the use of such tactics by policy making officials of the District of \nColumbia \n165.  DC policy maker Mayor Anthony Williams has stated his approval of the MPD's tactics, \nreferring to arrest tactics of the MPD, as executed on April 15, 2000 (and repeated on \nInauguration Day 2001 and on September 27,2002) as \"preventative\" and \"proactive.\" \nPreventive detention and false arrest, whether referred to as \"preventative arrest\" or \n\"proactive arrest,\" when applied to a targeted group of persons seeking to exercise \nconstitutionally protected rights, in the absence of probable cause, is unconstitutional. \n166.  MPD policy makers approve of these tactics, which they have used repeatedly, and which \nare the subject of pending litigation related to their use on Inauguration Day \n(International Action Center et al. v.  United States et al., 0 l-CV- 72) and on April 15, \n2000 (Fifty Years Is Enough et al. v. District ofC  olumbia et aI., 01-CV- 811). In the \nalternative, MPD policy makers have acquiesced to these unconstitutional tactics. \n167.  On September 27,2002, the CDUs and other MPD officers were deployed for these \nunconstitutional purposes. \n168.  On September 27, 2002, the Department oft he Interior deployed u.S. Park Police to act \n36 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 16    Filed 02/07/03   Page 37 of 46\njointly with the MPD in carrying out this unconstitutional disruption strategy. Additional \nother individual officers and outside agencies which have yet to be identified also \nengaged in the same joint action. \n169.  The MPD maintains the policy, practice and/or custom of processing and treating \ndisparately those persons arrested for minor offenses in connection with political mass \narrests or round-ups. The disparate processing and treatment includes confinement for \nextended period of time including often overnight for alleged minor offenses, and the \nfailure to offer political massarrestees the post and trial option. \n170.  The above-referenced policies and customs, and also the failure to properly train its \nofficers, constitute deliberate indifference on the part ofpolicymakers of the District of \nColumbia to the constitutional rights of protesters in the Nation's Capital, as well as all \nthose who would associate with such protesters or report on them as media' \n17l.  The actions of the above-referenced defendants violated the following clearly established \nand well settled federal constitutional rights: \nl.  Freedom from the unreasonable seizure of one's person; \n2.  Freedom from govermnent disruption of, interference with, or retaliation for, \nengagement in free speech, assembly, association, petition and free press \nactivities. \n172.  The challenged actions and omissions constitute deliberate indifference on the part of the \nDistrict of Columbia, the federal defendants and other defendants to the constitutional \nrights of protesters in the Nation's Capital. \n173.  As a direct and proximate result of the acts or omissions of the defendants identified in \nthis complaint and the other unidentified agents and agencies acting jointly, each of the \n37 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 16    Filed 02/07/03   Page 38 of 46\nplaintiffs has suffered monetary and non-monetary, harm including deprivation of \nconstitutional rights under the First, Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S . \n. Constitution, loss ofliberty, as well as physical harm, emotional pain and suffering. \nOngoing Injury to Plaintiffs \n174.  Plaintiffs all suffer continued adverse and deterrent effects from the above-referenced \nconduct. \n175.  Defendants' illegal conduct subjects protesters and observers and all those who associate \nwith protesters to unconstitutional obstacles to the exercise of their rights. There is an \nintended, ongoing and continued deterrent effect caused by defendant's conduct, in that \nprotesters and others must face the reasonable fear that merely by assembling and \nexercising their right to free speech (or to listen to speech), they will risk being subject to \nthe unlawful tactics of the MPD and federal law enforcement, the risk of false \nimprisomnent and false arrest and preventive detention, as well as the exposure to force \n.a nd the threatened use of force by officers working with the mobile police lines. \n176.  Plaintiffs intend to, in the future, engage in or associate with First Amendment protected \nactivities in Washington, D.C. and seek injunctive relief to prevent future \nunconstitutional disruption. \nCLAIMS \nCOUNT I \nFalse Arrests at Vermont Avenue \n(First Amendment; Fourth Amendment; False Imprisonment; Fourteenth Amendment) \n177.

      "text": "Case 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 112    Filed 03/18/04   Page 1 of 11\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \nJEFFREY BARHAM, ET AL. \nPlaintiffs \nv.  : Civil Action No. 02-CV- 2283 (EGS) \nCHIEF CHARLES H. RAMSEY, ET AL. \nDefendants \nPLAINTIFFS' SUPPLEMENT \nREGARDING APPLICABILITY OF \nGROH V. RAMIREZ, 540 U.S. _  (2004) \nTO THE MOTIONS TO DISMISS BASED ON QUALIFIED IMMUNITY \nOn February 24,2004,1 the U.S. Supreme Court delivered its opinion in Groh v. Ramirez, \n540 U.S. __ (2004), No. 02-811 (February 24,2004), which addressed the issue of whether an \nofficer is entitled to qualified immunity for an unconstitutional search that was, without dispute, \nconducted with restraint and in good faith, where there was probable cause for a search warrant \nto issue, and on the basis of a warrant with a clerical error on its face that was not known to, or \nrelied upon, by the responsible officer. \nThe Supreme Court entertained and rejected argument that the failure to afford Groh with \nqualified immunity for his constitutionally unlawful search would create a constitutional \n1 In response to inquiry from plaintiffs' counsel, counsel for the defendants have \nrepresented that they do not intend to initiate a supplement regarding the applicability of Groh v. \nRamirez and prefer, instead, to file a response or responses to any supplement filed by plaintiffs. \nPlaintiffs have no objection to the defendants' filing of such responses on any timetable that is \nacceptable to the defendants and the Court. \n1 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 112    Filed 03/18/04   Page 2 of 11\nviolation out of a purported clerical error, would impose \"new\" and \"novel\" obligations upon law \nenforcement, would penalize actions taken in good faith, or would hamper or impede law \nenforcement. \nThe Groh Court ruled that qualified immunity did not protect Officer Groh from being \nheld financially liable on an individual basis. The Court reiterated the standards respecting the \nlimitations of the qualified immunity defense, and recognized the existing rule of law that \nrequires law enforcement and government officials to ensure that their responsibilities are \nconducted in conformity with clearly established constitutional rights. \nWhile Groh arises in the context of an unconstitutional search and (potential) seizure of \nproperty, its approach with respect to qualified immunity is no less applicable in the \ncircumstances present in Barham which implicate hundreds of unconstitutional searches and \nseizures of persons. In the Barham case, the facts are even more difficult for the individual \ndefendants, as there was not a single warrant (defective or otherwise) that issued or on which \nthey relied as the basis for any of the hundreds of false arrests they made on September 27, 2002. \nThe Facts of Groh \nJeffGroh, a veteran officer, was a special agent for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and \nFirearms. On the basis of a citizen report there existed probable cause to believe that on Joseph \nRamirez's ranch there was located an unlawful stock of weapons, including an automatic rifle, \ngrenades, and a grenade and rocket launcher. Groh, slip op. at 1 -2. \nGroh prepared and executed a detailed application for a search warrant, which described \nin particularity the items which were to be searched for. Id. The application was supported with a \ndetailed affidavit setting forth the basis for probable cause. Id. \n2 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 112    Filed 03/18/04   Page 3 of 11\nA Magistrate Judge reviewed the application, found that the affidavit established probable \ncause to believe that contraband was concealed on the premises and that sufficient grounds \nexisted for the issuance of a search warrant. Id. at 2-3. \nThe Court therefore issued the search warrant. \nGroh led the team that executed the search warrant. According to the Supreme Court, \nGroh \"acted with restraint in conducting the search.\" Id. at 9. He also presented a copy ofthe \nsearch warrant to Mrs. Ramirez and, upon request the following day, faxed to Ramirez' counsel a \ncopy ofthe page ofthe application that listed with particularity the items to be seized. Id. at 3. \nThe warrant, however, was thereafter discovered to be constitutionally deficient because, \neven though Groh identified with particularity the items to be searched for in both the affidavit \nand the accompanying application, when he typed up the warrant and offered it to the Magistrate, \nhe accidentally entered a description of the property to be searched in the part of the warrant \nform that called for a description of the property to be seized. Id. at 2 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). \nApplicability of Groh to Barham \nNo property was seized during the search. Nevertheless, the Ramirez family sued Officer \nGroh alleging that there had been a violation oftheir Fourth Amendment rights because of the \nunlawful search. \nThe Supreme Court rejected Groh's claims of qualified immunity, reaffirming the duty of \ngovernment agents - subject to the pain of individual financial liability upon failure - to \"make \nsure\" that their conduct abides by constitutional requirements. Groh, slip op. at 11, n.6. \nGroh contended that the deficiencies in the warrant were mere clerical errors, id. at 4, that \nGroh acted in good faith and that the deficiency in the warrant was the product, at worst, of a \n3 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 112    Filed 03/18/04   Page 4 of 11\nlack of due care, Id. at 13. He submitted that his actions - albeit constitutionally faulty - were \nconsequently protected under the doctrine of qualified immunity. Groh argued that to not \nimmunize his unconstitutional conduct would create novel and new obligations upon \ngovernment. Groh, slip op. at 11, n.6 . These claims echo some ofthe contentions raised by the \nDistrict of Columbia, the MPD and their decision and policy makers. \nThe evident fallacy in such arguments is that there is no societal interest in immunizing \nviolations of clearly established constitutional rights. These arguments were rejected outright by \nthe Supreme Court. \n\"[ Groh] mischaracterizes the [lower court's] decision [rejecting qualified immunity] \nwhen he contends that it imposed a novel proofreading requirement on officers \nexecuting warrants. The court held that officers leading a search team must' Mak[ e] \nsure that they have a proper warrant that in fact authorizes the search and seizure they \nare about to conduct.\" That is not a duty to proofread; it is, rather, a duty to ensure \nthat the warrant conforms to constitutional requirements.\" Groh, slip op. at 11, n. 6 \n(emphasis added) (citations omitted). \nLikewise, the Barham plaintiffs seek to impose no greater obligation upon the involved \ncommand and policy officials to make sure- -before they surround and arrest hundreds of \npolitical dissenters and onlookers --that they are not violating those persons' constitutional \nrights and, in the case of the Mayor, to make sure that he is not ratifying, participating in, or \ncontinuing unconstitutional police misconduct. \nThe Groh Court found that, given the availability of the relevant information (i.e., the \nface of the warrant itself), it was objectively unreasonable for Groh to have carried out the \nsearch. \n\"No reasonable officer could claim to be unaware of the basic rule, well established by \nour cases, that, absent consent or exigency, a warrantless search of the home is presumptively \n4 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 112    Filed 03/18/04   Page 5 of 11\nunconstitutional.\" Groh at 13, citing Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 586-588. In the \nBarham case, it is also fair to state that the unconstitutionality of warrantless arrests in the absent \nof probable cause is equally well established. See, ~ Dellums v. Powell, 566 F.2d 167 (D.C. \nCir.1977). \nThe Groh Court further took into consideration that internal police guidelines placed \nGroh on notice that he might be liable for executing a manifestly invalid warrant. Groh, slip op. \nat 12. The existence of such policies is not a matter of constitutional magnitude, standing alone, \nbut serves to underscore that, especially given such notice, it is not offensive either to \nconstitutional norms or sensibilities about fairness to impose financial liability. \nIn Barham, internal MPD training and guidelines likewise place officers on notice as to \nthe exacting procedures and standards to be followed in the conduct of mass arrests of political \nassemblages, see, ~, MPD Manual for Mass Demonstrations and Responding to Civil \nDisturbances, and on notice that officers or officials may liability in connection with an unlawful \narrest in the absence of probable cause.2 \nThe Groh Court took into consideration, and rejected, the argument that immunity was \nnecessary to avoid impeding effective law enforcement. The Court expressly considered the \nargument that the difficulty and importance of a law enforcement agent's duty, and the \"heat of \nPlaintiffs have not yet received documentary production from the District. Plaintiffs \n2 \npossess portions of the MPD training material for use of force, which provides that \"Liability of \nlaw enforcement officers, civil and criminal, may at anytime throughout an officer's career be an \nissue of concern.\" MPD training does not restrict itself to merely the liability that may attach for \ndirectly engaging in unconstitutional violations, but even places officers on notice that derivative \nor bystander liability may attach for failing to prevent another officer's unconstitutional conduct. \nA specifically identified constitutional violation in this training is \"Unlawful arrest - when there \nis no probable cause.\" See attached excepts, MPD Lesson Plan for Use of Force, September 14, \n2000. \n5 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 112    Filed 03/18/04   Page 6 of 11\nan ongoing and often dangerous\" situation might justify sufficient latitude to afford the officer \nimmunity for his constitutional violations. Groh, slip op. at 14, n.9. Noting the absence of \nexigency under the facts of Groh, the Supreme Court found that \"This is not the situation, \ntherefore, in which we have recognized that 'officers in the dangerous and difficult process of \nmaking arrests and executing search warrants require 'some latitude.'\"  Groh at 14, n.9, citing, \nMaryland v. Garrison, 480 u.S. 79, 87 (1987); See also Maryland v. Garrison, 480 U.S. 79, 86 \nn.11 (1987), quoting Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, 167 (1940) (\"[acceptable] \nmistakes must be those of reasonable men, acting of facts leading sensibly to their conclusion of \nprobability\"). \nFor the reasons asserted in plaintiffs' opposition, it was objectively unreasonable under \nthe circumstances of the Barham case, for the defendants to have acted as they did based on the \ninformation then reported and observed. \nAs Groh reflects, and as should be applied in Barham, where an official fails to abide by \n(or, as in the Barham case, acts in defiance of) clearly established constitutional requirements \nprotecting the civil rights of the public, that official cannot seek refuge from accountability by \nsuccessfully invoking qualified immunity for such misconduct. \nUnder the facts of Barham, the defendants could not have maintained an objectively \nreasonable belief that there existed probable cause to mass arrest as a group the hundreds of \npolitical dissenters, onlookers and bystanders as was intentionally committed on September 27, \n2002. \n6 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 112    Filed 03/18/04   Page 7 of 11\nRespectfully submitted, \nMarch 18, 2004 \nCarl Messineo (# 450033) \nMara Verheyden-Hilliard (# 430031) PARTNERSHIP FOR \nCIVIL JUSTICE, INC. \nNATIONAL LAW  YERS GUILD \nMASS DEFENSE COMMITTEE \n1901 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Suite 607 \nWashington, DC 20006 \n(202) 530-5630 \n(202) 530-5634 -facsimile \nCounsel for Plaintifft \n7 \n\n(,j   .. :~;..~! .

AND N.Y. \nMONITORING REPORT AND COMMENTS BY THE PARTNERSHIP FOR CIVIL \nJUSTICE FUND TO THE DISTRICT DEFENDANTS' TIDRD SIX MONTH REPORT \nON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF REQUIRED CHANGES TO POLICIES AND \nPRACTICES UNDER THE BARHAM CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n(Issued March 22, 2013) \nThe class action settlement agreement in Barham v. Ramsey, Civil Action No. 02-00283, \nassigned monitoring responsibilities to the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund and imposed \nreporting requirements upon the District of Columbia regarding measures to implement changes \nto policies and practices to ensure evidence preservation and to prevent recurrence oft he \nevidence loss and/or destruction that was identified by the PCJF in the course ofl itigation, and \nin the future. \n\"This is an oversight and reporting function that is intended to assure plaintiffS, the \nCourt, and the public that the Document Management, Retention and Preservation goals oft he \nSettlement Agreement are, infact, advanced and achieved. \"Joint Motionfor Final Approval of \nProposed Class Settlement and Payment Distributions, Supporting Memorandum at 38 (Docket \n#629). \nThis is the fifth ofs ix periodic reports, and accompanying comments by the PCJF, as \nrequired during a mandatory three year reporting period. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, \nthe District of Columbia is required to provide an advance copy ofi ts report to the PCJF.  \"The \nDistrict shall consider the comments by Class Counsel. The comments or response of Class \nCounsel, if any, shall be incorporated as an included attachment or exhibit and published in the \nfinal report. The reports shall be transmitted to Judge Emmet G. Sullivan, as well as made \npublicly available. \" \nWith respect to prior submissions, the District ofC  olumbia has refused to incorporate \nClass Counsel's comments as an included attachment and published in the final report, \nnecessitating a separate submission to the Court by Class Counsel ofi ts comments. Accordingly, \nthe Partnership for Civil Justice Fund respectfully submits its fifth monitoring report, which \nfollows herein: \n1 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 1007   Filed 03/22/13   Page 3 of 4\nWith respect to the mechanical obligations of establishing proper policies as well as an \naudit trail and evidentiary management system, the District appears to be in compliance with the \nterms of the Barham settlement agreement. \nHowever, so long as the District declines to hold accountable MPD General Counsel \nTerrence Ryan and attorneys working with him for their responsibility in connection with the \nsecretion or loss or destruction of evidence in this matter, the landmark and effective system put \ninto place by the Barham settlement could be circumvented. \nIt is clear, including from circumstances related to the discovery by D.C. Metropolitan \nPolice Department Officer John Strader of a book labeled \"JOCC Activation Running Resume,\" \nthat delivering evidence directly into the hands ofMPD General Counsel Terrence Ryan does not \nensure the preservation of such evidence and its ultimate entry into the evidence management \nsystem. It is a matter of record that many trails of inaccurate statements, evidence document loss \nand destruction in this case converge at the Offices of General Counsel Terrence Ryan and/or his \nDeputy General Counsel Ronald Harris. \nIn this Fifth Report, as the preceding Reports, the PCJF recommends again that \nany person implicated in [the secretion, mislocation or destruction] of evidence in \nthe  [MPD]  Office  of General  Counsel be  suspended pending investigation to \nprotect the integrity of evidence that runs through the OGC. The system that has \nbeen established, including through settlement terms, for imposing litigation holds \nand for tracking and managing evidence can be effective only if evidence reaches \nthe entry point. \nGiven the failure for such disciplinary action to be undertaken, the PCJF further \nrecommends such investigation be undertaken by an independent agency, such as by referral for \ncriminal investigation and prosecution to the Department of Justice for action by the Public \nIntegrity Division, the Civil Rights Division or whatever special attorney or specialized division \nis deemed most suitable by the U.S. Attorney General; or for the appointment of special counsel \nconsistent with the statutory authority provided in 28 U.S.C. § 1815. \nThe PCJF represented to this Court, in its Second Monitoring Report and Comments, \nissued September 23,2011, that the Washington Field Office (WFO) ofthe Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation (FBI) is itself conflicted out of any investigation into evidence or destruction or \ntampering by the Office of General Counsel. That representation was precisely correct, as \nreflected by the failure of the WFO, which was tasked with investigating obstruction of justice in \nconnection with certain running resume data, to conduct a minimally proper investigation. The \nFBI failed to analyze and investigate the loss and destruction of the running resume data in the \nGroup Systems, i.e., the operational running resume system (as distinguished from  the E-Teams \nSystem, which appears to have been run in a testing mode as it was being considered as a \nsuccessor system). \nAncillary or corollary to the implementation of an effective set of policies and document \nmanagement systems to preserve evidence is the imposition of accountability for those \nresponsible for loss, secretion or destruction of evidence. The District of Columbia agrees that \n2 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 1007   Filed 03/22/13   Page 4 of 4\nthe threshold for a criminal investigation and potential prosecution has been met. However, as \nbefore, no personal accountability has been imposed to date. \n3 ",

Ramsey, No. 03-767, challenging the Pershing Park arrests and detentions that are a\nprincipal subject of the amended complaint herein.   The Abbate case was assigned to Judge\nSullivan.  On the following day, the plaintiffs in Abbate filed a motion to coordinate briefing and\nargument on the motions for class certification already on file in the present case and to be filed\nin Abbate.\nContemporaneously with this motion, the District Defendants are filing a comparable\nmotion to enlarge and a memorandum in response to the Abbate plaintiffs’ motion to coordinate.\nThe District Defendants respectfully suggest that the Court should consolidate the two cases\nbecause they both purport to be class actions dealing with the same events and transactions.\nLike this case, Abbate is a putative class action arising out of the Pershing Park arrests on\nSeptember 27, 2003.  The plaintiffs here have named more defendants than have the plaintiffs in\nAbbate, and the allegations here go beyond the arrests effected by the MPD at Pershing Park to\ninclude alleged activities of other governmental entities and events that transpired at additional\nlocations. However, the core issues of the Abbate complaint, concerning the September 27\narrests at Pershing Park, plainly overlap the allegations of the complaint in this case.\nThe District Defendants believe that in response to the plaintiffs’ motion, the Court\nshould go beyond the mere coordination of argument on the class certification motions and\nshould consolidate the two class actions.  To that end, the Court should direct counsel for\nplaintiffs in the two cases to cooperate in the filing of a single consolidated amended complaint\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 24    Filed 04/08/03   Page 5 of 9\nthat will embrace the allegations common to the two cases, so that the Court and the defendants\ndo not have to deal with two simultaneous class actions that address the same occurrences and\nevents.\nDirecting consolidation will be in accord with the general rule that the Court should not\ncertify more than one class action where different putative class representatives and their counsel\npress competing claims.  See Manual for Complex Litigation, § 30.15, at 219 (3d ed. 1995).  A\nleading treatise on class actions is in accord:\nTo facilitate case management for determining common class issues which will be the\nbasis for discovery and trial, the court may direct the multiple parties [plaintiffs] to file a\nconsolidated class complaint or to amend the relevant complaints to make them uniform\nregarding the scope of the class and the alternative legal theories alleged . . . .\n[3 Conte & Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions, § 7:31, at 93 (4th ed. 2002).] The District\nDefendants take no position as to whether this Court, or Judge Sullivan, to whom the plaintiffs\nhave presented their motion to coordinate in Abbate, should preside over one consolidated\nproceeding.   This Court has the earlier filed of the two proposed class actions.\nDefendants note that the case of Chang v. District of Columbia, No. 02-2010, is also\nassigned to Judge Sullivan. Chang is an earlier case but not a proposed class action.  It is brought\nby  seven  plaintiffs  who  challenge  their  arrests  and  the  circumstances  of  their  ensuing\nconfinement,  in  connection  with  their  presence  at  Pershing  Park  allegedly  either  as  legal\nobservers  or  as  photojournalists,  though  not  as  demonstrators.  Chang  plainly  is  related  in\nsubject-matter to Abbate and the present case, and it may thus effect judicial economy to assign\nall three cases to a single Judge.2\n                                                \n2The Court also should be aware of Franklin Jones v. District of Columbia, 02-2310, pending\nbefore Judge Kessler.  That case, filed after Chang, but before Barham, is not a class action and\nis brought by three plaintiffs – one of whom allegedly was arrested at Pershing Park and the\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 24    Filed 04/08/03   Page 6 of 9\nWhile  the  Court  is  considering  the  present  motion  to  consolidate  and  the  District\nDefendants’ response to the Abbate plaintiffs’ motion to coordinate, the District Defendants\nrespectfully request that the Court enlarge further their time to respond to the amended complaint\nand enlarge their time to respond to the motion for class certification.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, and for such further reasons as may appear to the Court, the\nDistrict Defendants respectfully submit that the Court should consolidate this case with Abbate\nso as to present a single putative class action to which the various defendants may respond in due\ncourse.  In the interim, the Court should defer the District defendants’ responses to the complaint\nand the motion for class certification.  A proposed form of order embodying the foregoing\nsuggestion is annexed to this memorandum.3\n                                                                                                                                                            \nother two elsewhere.  The District previously submitted notices of related cases in Chang and\nJones.\n3The proposed order contemplates that counsel in the two pending putative class actions will be\nable to agree among themselves upon a single consolidated amended complaint.  In the event that\ncounsel are unable to do so, the Manual prescribes the various considerations that the Court will\nwish to consider and procedures to be followed in structuring a single putative class action.  See\nManual, supra, §§ 30.15 (multiple cases and classes/subclasses), 30.16 (selection of counsel and\nrepresentatives).\nIn the event the Court declines to grant the instant motion, the District defendants respectfully\nrequest in the alternative that they be permitted an additional 15 and 30 days following the\nCourt’s decision on the motion, respectively, to respond to plaintiffs’ amended complaint and\nmotion for class certification.\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS -JMF   Document 24    Filed 04/08/03   Page 7 of 9\nRespectfully submitted,\nARABELLA W.

United States. Park Police official at the time of the events in \nquestiofr, was. sued in his. personal capacity for his. participation \nin  a  mass  arrest  that  occurred  dUFing  demonstrations  in \nSeptember 2002 in protest against policies of the World Bank \nand IntemationalMonetary Fund. Murphy argued to the district \ncourt that he was entitled to qualified immunity, under which he \nwould be shiehted from  liability.  The district court denied \nMurphy's motion to dismiss and fo1' summary judgment on the \nlJas.i..s  of qualified immunity. and Murphy  filed  the  instant \ninterlocutory appeal. Controlling precedent establishesthat our \njurisdiction t(} hear interlocutory appeals in qualified immunity \ncases does not extend to  appeals in which the  underlying \ndecision relies. upon resoluti(}n of disputed facts.  Because \nMurphy's claim to qualified immunity depends on resolving \nfacts.in dispute, we conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review \nthe district court's determination. \nBackground \nThe factual history of this. case has. been set forth in detail \nbefore. See Barham v. Ramsey, 434 F.3d 565,569-71 (D.C. Cir. \n2006)~ Barham v.  Ramsey, JJ& F.Supp.2d 48, 52-54 (D.D.C. \n2004).  We will therefore focus only on the facts necessary to \nresolve the issue before us. \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 475-1   Filed 04/21/09   Page 3 of 21\n3 \nOn Friday, September 27,2002, mass demonstrations were \nheld in Washington, D.C., protesting the meetings of the World \nBank and International Monetary Fund.  Around 8:15 a.m. a \nlarge group of individuals began to gather in General John \nPershing  Park  (\"Pershing  Park\"  or  \"Park\"),  located  on \nPennsylvania Ave., N.W., between 14th Street and 15th Street, \nacross from the White House grounds. At about this same time, \nofficers oft he Metropolitan Police Department (\"MPD\"), led by \nAssistant Chief Peter Newsham, began stationing around the \nperimeter of the Park.  About an hour later, United States Park \nPolice officers, after being informed ofthe gathering, arrived at \nPershing Park led by appellant Major Richard Murphy, who, at \nthat time, was Commander of the Special Forces Branch of the \nU.S. Park Police.  Around 9:20 a.m., an MPD officer asked \nMurphy to assist the MPD in surrounding the Park, at which \npoint Park Police officers were sent to the north and south sides \nof the Park.  Murphy had two separate exchanges with MPD \nAssistant Chief Newsham.  According to Murphy, during the \nfirst exchange, Newsham asked Murphy if those in the Park \ncould be arrested for deqlonstratiI)g without a permit.  Murphy \nresponded that they could be arrested, but that it was Park Police \npolicy not to arrest unless the demonstrators had first been \nwarned and given an opportunity to disperse.  Soon thereafter, \nNewsham informed Murphy that the individuals in Pershing \nPark were going to be arrested for failure to obey a police order \nto disperse that was given to them before they entered the Park. \nAround this same time MPD Chief Charles Ramsey arrived \non the scene.  He too was informed by  Newsham that the \nindividuals in-the Park were going to be arrested. All persons in \nthe Park were subsequently arrested for  failure to obey an \nofficer. Many oft hose arrested later brought suit against various \npolice agencies and officials, alleging constitutional, statutory, \nand common law violations stemming from the arrests.  MPD \nChief Ramsey,  Assistant Chief Newsham,  and Park Police \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 475-1   Filed 04/21/09   Page 4 of 21\n4 \nMajor Murphy were als.o sued in their individual capacities. The \ness@nce o.fthe suit is. that the defendants. violated the plaintiffs.' \nco.nstitutio.nal rights when the police co.rdo.nedo.ffPershingPark \nand then initiated a mass. arrest.  In the district court, Murphy \nfiled a motio.n to. dismiss. the case against him o.n gro.unds o.f \nqualified immunity.  Pursuant to Int '/ Action Ctr.  v.  United \nStates,  \"[qlualified  immunity  protects go.vernment  officials \n'from liability fo.r civil damages. insofaf as their co.nduct does. \nno.t violate clearly established s.tatutory or co.nstitutio.nal rights \no.f which a reas.onable perso.n Wo.uld have kno.wn. \", 365 F. 3d 20, \n24 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (quoting Harlow v.  Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. \n800, 818 (1982)). The district Co.urt denied the mo.tion. Murphy \nappeals. \nDiscussion \nWe have had prior occas.io.n to. address. two. o.ther claims o.f \nquaLified immunity by Po.Lice officials invo.lvedin a mass arrest. \nSee Barham v. Ramsey, 434 F.3d 565,569-71 (D.c. Cir. 2006) \n(\"Ramsey\").  We began our analysis there, as. we do. here, by \nnoting that 2& U.S.C. §. 129-1 gives. appeltate co.urts.jurisdiction \no.ver  \"final  decisio.ns.\"  o.f  the  dis.trict  courts.  Id  at  571. \nOnliaarily, disHict Co.urt final decisio.ns are appealable o.nly at \nthe  conclusion- of district  COUI1  pro.ceedings.  There  are, \nhowever, ceftai.B. types-o.f district court decisions that are too. \nimportant and too independent o.f the merits of the action to \nawait the end o.f district Co.urt proceedings befOFe appellate \nreview is. allowed.  See Cohen v. BenefiCial Indus. Loan, 337 \nU. S. 541, 546 (1949): Included in this catego.ry of interlocuto.ry \napf)eals is a denial by the district court of qualified immunity. \nAs we noted in Ramsey, qualified immunity  shields. certain \ndeserving o.fticials from undergoing the burdens of litigation, \nand if denial' of a  claim o.f  qualified immunity  were  no.t \nimmediately appealable then the doctrine Wo.uld be eviscerated. \n434  F.ld at  571.  However,  \"this extensio.n  of appellate \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 475-1   Filed 04/21/09   Page 5 of 21\n5 \njurisdiction is not endlessly elastic.\" Id at 577.  In Johnson v. \nJones, the Supreme Court held that immediate appellate review \nis not allowed if a district court's decision \"resolved a fact \nrelated dispute about the pre-trial record.\"  515 U.S. 304, 307 \n(1995); see also Ramsey, 434 F.3d at 571. \nIn Ramsey, MPD Police ChiefR  amsey and Assistant Police \nChief Newsham moved to dismiss the suits against them under \nthe doctrine of qualified immunity. The district court denied the \nmotions, and on interlocutory appeal we affirmed the district \ncourt's  denial  of Newsham's  motion.  Nevertheless,  we \nconcluded that we lacked jurisdiction to review the  court's \ndenial of Ramsey's motion. \nIn discussing Newsham's qualified immunity claims, we \nfirst made reference to the two-part inquiry set forth in Saucier \nv. Katz, 533 U.S. 194,201 (2001), for determining whether a \ngovernment official is protected by qualified immunity.'  See \nRamsey, 434 F.3d at 572. Under that inquiry, a court determines \nthe threshold question of whether, taking the facts in the light \nmost favorable to the alleged injured party, \"the facts alleged  . \nshow the officer's conduct violated a constitutional right.\" Id. \n(quoting Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201). Ifthat question is answered \nin the affirmative, the court then asks whether the constitutional \nright was clearly established.  Ramsey, 434 F.3d at 572 (citing \nSaucier, 533 U.S. at201). In Newsham's case, we answered the \nthreshold question in the affirmative, as the plaintiffs' complaint \nwas that they  were  arrested  without  probable  cause while \nengaged in acts protected by the First Amendment. Ramsey, 434 \nI. \nF.3d at 572.  We also answered the second question in the \n'We note that the Supreme Court recently held. \"that the \nSaucier protocol should not be regarded as mandatory in all cases.\" \nPearson v.  Callahan, - S. Ct. -, 2009 WL  128768 (U.S.), at *11 \n(Jan. 21, 2009). \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 475-1   Filed 04/21/09   Page 6 of 21\n6 \naffirmative, finding that Newsham did not have probable cause \nto make the ma&S arrest&. because he \"had no basi&. for &uspecting \nthat all oft he occupants ofPersning Park were then breaking the \nlaw or that they had bt:oken the law before entering the Park.\" \nId. at 574.  And we further noted the \"fluidity of movement in \nand around the Park,\" as well as Newsham's not denying that \nmany individuals in the Park were law-abiding, as additional \ngrounds for concluding that there wasno probable cause for the \nmass-arrest.  Id.  We c()l1sequently affirmed the district court's \ndenial ofNewsJ:lam's requestfor qualified immunity. ld. at 579. \nWe next considered Chief Ramsey'So qualified immunity \nclaim.  Id.  at 577-78.  We noted that,. according to. the record \nassembled for summary judgment, at some point after Newsham \nordered the Park to be cord()ned off, Ramsey arrived on the \nscene.  Id. at 577.  At this point,  Newsham stated to Ramsey \nthat there was. probable cause to arrest those in the Park for \noffenses committed before they entered the Park.  Id.  Ramsey \nstated that he was. unaware that the Park contained individuals \nwho  were  not  previously  observed  engaging  in  unlawful \nactivity.  Id at 578.  Ramsey's situation was different from \nNewsham's, we observed, in that Ramsey denied. knowing that \nthe Park had not been cleared of law-abiding individuals.  Id \nWe noted that if this claim by Ramsey was. valid then Ramsey \nmight be entitled to-qualified immlHlity.  Id.  But we also noted \nthat,  because  of contradictions  in  the  record  concerning \nRamsey's claim, this factual question could not be answered \ndefinitively.  Id  Accordingly,. under the Supreme Court's \nholding in Johnson v. Jones, we concluded that the denial oJ \nquafified  immunity  to  Ramsey  was  not  reviewable  on  } \ninterlocutory appeal.  !d. at 577-5.78.  ) \nIn its considerati()n  of Murphy's request for  qualified \nimmunity in the present case, the district court relied on our \ndisposition of Newsham' s qualified immunity claim in Ramsey. \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 475-1   Filed 04/21/09   Page 7 of 21\n7 \nChang v.  United States, Civ. Action Nos. 02-2010, G2-2283, \n2007 WL 2007335, at * 10 (D.D.C. July 10,2007).  The district \ncourt first noted that, in denying Newsham's claim for qualified \nimmunity, this court rejected Newsham's argument that there \nwas, probable cause for the arrests based on the failure to obey \na police order. Id The district court also noted that we held that \nNewsham had presented \"no facts capable of supporting the \nproposition  that  Newsham  had  reasonable,  particularized \ngrounds to believe that every one oft he 386 people arrested was \nobserved committing a crime.\" ld (quoting Ramsey, 434 F,3d \nat 574).  Further, the court noted that this court had pointed to \nthe fluidity of movement in and around the Park preceding the \narrests  as  a  further  basis  for  discrediting  any  attempt  by \n.~  Newsham to argue probable cause.  Chang, 2007 WL 2007335, \nat *10 (citing Ramsey, 434 F.3d at 574).  The district court \nfound no relevant distinction between Murphy's conduct and \nNewsham's.  Chang, 2007WL 2007335, at *10.  In its opinion \nthe court concluded that \"Murphy' cannot point to undisputed \nfacts that suggest that the Park Police had a basis for believing \nthat Pershing Park contained only individuals for whom there \nwas probable cause to  make an arrest.\"  Chang, 2007 WL \n2007335, at *9.  The court determined that, when Murphy \narrived at the Park, he observed people entering and leaving the \nPark, he made no independent assessment of whether there was \nprobable cause to arrest all individuals in the Park, and he 'did \nnot see any violent activity by individuals there.  Chang, 2007 \nWL 2007335, at * 10. The dis.trict court further determined that, \nalthough Newsham told Murphy that those in the Park were \nbeing arrested for disobeying a police order, Murphy did npt \nknow which order, who disobeyed it, or when the disobedience \noccurred.  Id  Based on these determinations, the district court \nconcluded that it was not reasonable for Murphy, in participating \nin the mass arrests, to rely only on Newsham's statement that all \nof the individuals in the Park were being arrested for failing to \nobey a police order. Id  The district court consequently denied \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 475-1   Filed 04/21/09   Page 8 of 21\n8 \nMurphy's motions to dismiss and for summary judgment on the \nground of qualified immunity.  Id. \nOn review, however, we conclude that Murphy's situation \nis  more  analogous  to  Ramsey's  than  to  Newsham's,  and \nconsequently we lack jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal. \nAccording  to  Murphy,  early  on  the  morning  of  the \ndemonstrations, he was in Park Police mobile headquarters near \nthe  White  House~ his  main  objective  at  the  time  of the \ndemonstrations was the security of the White House.  While at \nmobile headquarters, Murphy received reports that protestors in \ndifferent parts of the city were marching in the streets, as well as \nreports that intersections were being disrupted.  After receiving \na radio transmission that protestors were  in Pershing Park, \nacross from the White House grounds, Murphy  left mobile \nheadquarters and proceeded towards the Park. Upon arrival, he \nobserved individuals in the Park, and he was then stopped by an \nMPD official who asked Murphy for Park Police help in holding \nthose individuals in the Park. Murphy stated that at this time he \nwas \"scampering around,\" and that he felt this was an \"urgent \nsituation\" as he wanted to prevent movement of those in the \nPark towards the White House.  Soon thereafter, Murphy was \napproached  by  Assistant  Chief Newsham,  at  which  time \nNewsham asked Murphy if the group in Pershing Park had a \npermit to demonstrate there.  After Murphy advised that the \ngroup did not, Newsham asked Murphy if those in the Park \ncould be arrested for demonstrating without a permit.  Murphy \nreplied that they could be arrested, but that it was Park Police \npolicy to order such groups to disperse first.  Murphy then \noverheard a high ranking MPD official state that those in the \nPark had been involved in acts of vandalism and other crimes \nbefore they had-arrived at the Park. A second conversation with \nNewsham then ensued, during which Newsham indicated to \nMurphy  that the individuals in the Park were going to  be \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 475-1   Filed 04/21/09   Page 9 of 21\n9 \narrested for failing to obey a police order to get out of the street \nmade prior to their congregating in the PMk.  Murphy ordered \nhis men to assist MPD in forming lines around the Park to \nprevent those inside from leaving.  At the same time, however, \nit appears that Murphy saw, at least from a distance, individuals \nfreely coming and going from the Park. \nIn Ramsey, we noted that a critical question in deciding \nRamsey's  claim  to  qualified  immunity  turned  on  \"[t]he \nplausibility  of his  claim  that  he  thought  all  law-abiding \nbystanders had been evacuated, while hundreds of lawbreakers \nwere corralled into an enclosed area.\" Ramsey, 434 F.3d at 57&. \nRamsey claimed that he did not know that Pershing Park had not \nbeen cleared of law-abiding bystanders before the mass arrests \nwere conducted. Id We found, however, that that claim was not \nundisputed, and consequently that Johnson v. Jones barred us \nfrom  exercising jurisdiction over an interlocutory appeal on \nfactual issues. Id at 577-78. Here, if Murphy shows that he had \nan objectively reasonable \"basis for believing that Pershing Park \ncontained only individuals for whom there was probable cause \nto make an arrest,\" id. at 577, then he may be entitled to qualified \nimmunity.  But the record assembled so far does not lead to a \ndetermination as to  whether Murphy  in fact has this basis. \nMurphy states that he trusted Newsham that probable cause \nexisted to arrest those in the Park.  But this statement is not \nenough  to  establish  an  undisputed  fact.  Following  our \ndisposition of Chief Rams.ey' s. claims. in Ramsey, we conclude \nthat Murphy's claim that he had a basis for believing that there \nwas. probable cause to arrest all individuals in Pershing Park \ncannot be determined on the record before us. See id Moreover, \nthis issue is not for this. court to decide~ rather, it is.an issue to be \ndetermined by a fact finder, and \"the District Court was therefore \ncorrect in allowing the claims against [Murphy} to proceed.\" Id. \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 475-1   Filed 04/21/09   Page 10 of 21\n10 \nConclusion \nFor  the  foregoing  reasons  we  conclude  that  we  lack \njurisdiction to review the district court's denial of Murphy's  +-\nmotions regarding qualified immunity. \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 475-1   Filed 04/21/09   Page 11 of 21\nKAREN LECRAFT HENDERSON, Circuit Judge, concurring: \nAlthough I agree with my colleagues that we lack juris.diction to \nreview the district court's denial of Murphy's claim to qualified \nimmunity because of a factual dispute, I write separately to \nemphasize a point oflaw. In United States v. Hensley, 469 U.S. \n221 (1985), the United States Supreme Court concluded that a \npolice officer may make a Terry stop. in \"objective reliance\" on \na \"flyer or bulletin ... issued on the basis of articulable facts \nsupporting a reasonable suspicion.\" 469 U. S. at 232. The Court \nnoted that even if the flyer  were  issued absent reasonable· \nsuspicion, \"the officers making the s.top may have a good-faith \ndefense to any civil suit.\" Id  Similarly, an officer may rely on \nanother officer's determination of probable cause to make an \narrest, which will often be the case in a rapidly evolving-and \npotentially deteriorating-situation like the one confronting \nMurphy.  See id at 231 ('''[EJffective law enforcement cannot \nbe conducted unless police officers can act on directions and \ninformation transmitted by  one officer to another and  . . . \nofficers, who must often act swiftly, cannot be expected to \ncross-examine their fellow officers-about the foundation for the \ntransmitted information. '\"  (quoting United States v. Robinson, \n536  F.2d  1298,  1299  (9th  Cir.  1976»;  United  States  v. \nLoundmannz, 472 F.2d 1376, 1379 (D.C. Cir. 19\"72) (probable \ncause exists if officer ordering arrest has \"adequate first-hand \nknowledge to support a finding of probable cause\" even though \narresting officer does not have first-hand knowledge ); Daniels \nv. United States, 393 F.2d 359,361 (D.C. Cir. 1968) (\"There is \nno requirement that the arresting officer have sufficient firsthand \nknowledge to constitute probable cause.  It is enough that the \npolice officer initiating the chain of communication either had \nfirsthand knowledge or received his information from some \n.p erson . . . who it seems reasonable to believe is telling the \ntruth.\").  As noted by the majority, Murphy statesthat he relied \non Newsham's determination that probable cause existed to \narrest the hundreds of individuals in Pershing Park for failure to \nobey a police order before entering the Park. Murphy' sreliance, \nhowever, must be objectively reasonable for him to be clothed \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 475-1   Filed 04/21/09   Page 12 of 21\n2 \nwith qualified immunity. Murphy states that he \"had nothing in \nthe way of an opinion or reason . . . to contradict or not to \nbelieve what [Newsham] was telling [him] was true.\"  Tr. of \nDeposition ofR  ichard Murphy at 252: 10-13, Barham v. Ramsey, \nCiv.  No.  02-2283  (D.D.C.  Feb.  2,  2005) (Dep.  Tr.).  But \nMurphy's statement that he \"s[aw] citizens coming and going \nfrom a distance further on the south side of Pershing Park in the \nvicinity of 14th Street,\" Dep. Tr. 229: 13-15, creates a genuine \nissue  of material  fact  regarding  whether  his  reliance  on \nNewsham's determination that probable cause existed to arrest \nevery  individual  in  the  Park  was  objectively  reasonable. \nMurphy differs in this respect from Newsham, whom we earlier \nfound not entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law. \nBarham v. Ramsey, 434 F.3d 565,568 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  I read \nthe majority opinion, Maj. Op. at 9, to leave open the possibility \nthat Murphy, like MPD Chief Charles Ramsey, may yet have \nqualified immunity if the facts are resolved in his favor.  See \nBarham, 434 F.3d at 568 (\"[Ramsey's] entitlement to qualified \nimmunity thus turns on whether he knew that the park had not \nbeen cleared of individuals who were not observed breaking the \nlaw.  Based on the record assembled for summary judgment, it \nis not possible for us to answer that question. Because Ramsey's \nclaim for immunity turns on the resolution of factual disputes \nregarding his participation in the events of September 27,2002, \nhis appeal is premature. \"). \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 475-1   Filed 04/21/09   Page 13 of 21\n~nit£.h ~tttt£s ([ourt of J\\pp£ttls \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT \nNo. 07-7136  September Term, 2008 \nFILED ON: MARCH 6, 2009 \nELLIOT WOLFF, PERSONALLY AND AS TRUSTEE OF THE TRUST ESTABLISHED UNDER ARtICLE III OF \nTHE ESTATE OF EGON WOLFF, \nI \nAPPELLANTS  UNITED STATES COURT Of APPEALS \nFOR DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT \nv. \nFllEOL-l _M_.t._!1_6_2009_-J \nWESTWOOD MANAGEMENT, LLC, ET AL., \nAPPELLEES  I \n_  CLERK \nAppeal from the United States District Court \nfor the District of Columbia \n(No.06cv01234) \nBefore: ROGERS, BROWN and GRIFFITH, Circuit Judges \nJUDGMENT \nThis cause came on to be heard on the record on appeal from the United States District \nCourt for the District of Columbia and was argued by counsel.

Finding no error, we affirm. \n1. \nIn 1971, Elliot Wolffs father, Egon, invested in a real \nestate  venture-the  District  of  Columbia  Joint  Venture \n(DCJV}-organized by Dr.  Laszlo Tauber that developed a \npiece of District real estate into an office building complex \nknown  as  the  Transpoint  building.  For  his  $20,000 \ninvestment, Egon received an interest of 0.5% in the land and \n0.25% in the building.  The agreement Egon signed when he \ninvested  in  the  DCN  (DCJV  Agreement)  contained  an \narbitration clause, providing that \"[t]he parties agree not to \nenter into any court action in any dispute which may arise \nduring construction and management of the office building \ncomplex and agree that any dispute or controversy that cannot \nbe amicably settled will be submitted to arbitration[.]\" \nEgon Wolff died in November 1984, and his interest in \nthe DCJV passed to the appellants, Elliot Wolff and a trust \nestablished from Egon's estate.  On December 6,  1984, Dr. \nTauber wrote a letter to the DCN investors, along with those \nwho  had  invested  in  other  ventures  he  had  organized, \ninforming them  that  his  \"long  standing  goal  has  been  to \nmerge all the partnerships into one single partnership.  This \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 475-1   Filed 04/21/09   Page 16 of 21\n3 \nmust  be  achieved  now with no  further  delay.\"  The  letter \nmade the merger \"effective the  1st of January,  1985,\" and \ngave  the  investors  four  options:  to  sell  their  interest,  to \nbecome a class \"B\" partner in the new entity, to  become a \nclass  \"C\"  partner  in  the  new  entity,  or-for anyone  who \n\"ha[d] second thoughts and [wa]s not willing to cooperate\" \nto \"put his/her interest in trust.\"  The new entity, referred to as \nthe  Consolidated Partnership,  was  reorganized  into  various \nother entities over time. \nThough the record is silent on this point, the parties agree \nElliot Wolff declined  to join the  Consolidated Partnership. \nWolff alleges he asked Dr. Tauber to hold his DCJV interest \nin  trust.  As  a  result,  Wolff  was  not  a  party  to  the \nConsolidated Partnership agreement nor was he an owner of, \nor  investor  in,  any  of the  successor  entities.  Rather,  his \nownership  interest  of 0.5%  in  the  land  and  0.25%  in  the \nbuilding  that  made  up  the  Transpoint  Building  complex, \nacquired via the DCJV Agreement, was held for him in trust \nby Dr. Tauber and his successors. \nAfter Dr. Tauber died in 2002, management and control \nof  all  the  ventures  stemming  from  the  Consolidated \nPartnership  went  to  appellee  Westwood Management.  In \nFebruary 2004, Westwood Management sold the Transpoint \nBuilding and the adjacent land and paid the investors.  Wolff \nfiled this lawsuit in 2006: \nalleging  breach  of  fiduciary  duty  and \nderivative  claims,  all  resulting  from  the \nmanagement  and  sale  of  the  Transpoint \nbuilding and the adjacent lot.  He alleges that \ndefendants used funds from various mortgages \nand refinances of the Transpoint building and \nthe adjacent lot for purposes other than for use \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 475-1   Filed 04/21/09   Page 17 of 21\n4 \nby  and  for  the  Transpoint  building  and  that \nadjacent  lot;  specifically,  to  make \nimprovements  to  other  properties  and  for \ndefendants' enrichment. \n) \nWo(ffv.  Westwood Mgmt., 503 F. Supp. 2d 274,278 (D.D.C.  ) \n2007). \nThe district court granted defendants' motion to compel \narbitration.  In response to Wolffs argument that the DCN \nAgreement and its arbitration clause were extinguished by the \ncreation of the  Consolidated Partnership,  the  district court \nconcluded the agreement to arbitrate survived the expiration \nof the  DCJV Agreement  and  applied  to  this  dispute.  Id \nat 281.  The district court reasoned \"[t]he obligations at issue \nin this case can only have arisen from the DCJV Agreement \nbecause there was no other agreement with defendants that \nWolff entered into.\"  Id.  The district court noted that if the \narbitration clause was to  be read  broadly-\"any dispute  or \ncontroversy  . . . will  be  submitted to  arbitration\"-then it \nencompasses  all  matters  that touch  upon the  contract.  Id \nat 282.  If read  narrowly-\"any  dispute  which  may  arise \nduring construction and management of the office building \ncomplex\"-then it covers only  specified types  of disputes. \nId.  The dispute at issue in this case was covered under either \nreading  of the  arbitration  clause.  Id  at  283.  The  court \ntherefore concluded the parties had entered into a valid and \nenforceable arbitration agreement that covered the claims in \nthis case, and dismissed the complaint.  This appeal followed. \n} \n) \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 475-1   Filed 04/21/09   Page 18 of 21\n5 \nII. \nThe  \"determination  that  the  parties  have  contractually \nbound  themselves  to  arbitrate  disputes-a  determination \ninvolving interpretation of state  law-.i s  a legal  conclusion \nsubject to our de novo review, ... but the findings upon which \nthat  conclusion  is  based  are  factual  and  thus  may  not  be \noverturned unless clearly  erroneous.\"  Bailey v.  Fed  Nat'l \nMortgage Ass 'n, 209 F.3d 740, 744 (D.C. Cir. 2000).  Under \nDistrict of Columbia law,  \"arbitration is  predicated  on  the \nconsent of the parties to a dispute, and the determination of \nwhether the parties have consented to arbitrate is a matter to \nbe determined by the courts on the basis of contracts between \nthe parties.\"  Bailey, 209 F.3d at 746; see also Air Line Pilots \nAss 'n v. Fed Express Corp., 402 F.3d 1245, 1248 (D.C. Cir. \n2005). \n\"[A]n order to  arbitrate  [a]  particular grievance should \nnot be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance \nthat  the  arbitration  clause  is  not  susceptible  of  an \ninterpretation that covers the asserted dispute.  Doubts should \nbe resolved in favor of coverage.\"  Air Line Pilots Ass 'n, 402 \nF.3d  at 1248  (quoting  United  Steelworkers  of America  v. \nWarrior &  Gulf Nav.  Co.,  363  U.S.  574,  582-83  (1960)). \n\"The Arbitration Act establishes that, as a matter of federal \nlaw,  any  doubts  concerning the  scope  of arbitrable  issues \nshould  be  resolved  in  favor  of arbitration,  whether  the \nproblem at hand is the construction of the contract language \nitself or an allegation of waiver, delay, or a like defense to \narbitrability.\"  Moses H  Cone Memorial Hasp.  v.  Mercury \nConstr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1,24-25 (1983). \nWolff  contends  the  arbitration  clause  in  the  DCJV \nAgreement  does  not  apply  to  this  dispute  because  the \nagreement terminated in  1985.  And, appellants argue, their \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 475-1   Filed 04/21/09   Page 19 of 21\n6 \nclaims arise under the alleged trust; not the DCJV.  But, as the \ndistrict court observed, \"an arbitration clause is enforceable \nafter the expiration of a contract when the dispute is over an \nobligation created by the contract.\"  Wolff,  503 F.  Supp.  2d \nat 280.  We agree. \nThe Supreme Court has observed that \"a party cannot be \ncompelled  to  arbitrate  any  matter  in  the  absence  of  a \ncontractual  obligation  to  do  so.  Adherence  to  these \nprinciples,  however,  does  not  require  us  to  hold  that \ntermination  of  a  collective-bargaining  agreement \nautomatically  extinguishes  a  party's  duty  to  arbitrate \ngrievances arising under the contract.\"  Nolde Bros. v.  Local \nNo.  358, Bakery and Confectionery Workers Union, 430 U.S. \n243, 250-51 (1977).  \"[E]ven though the parties could have \nso  provided,  there  is  nothing  in  the  arbitration clause that \nexpressly excludes from its operation a dispute which arises \nunder the contract, but which is based on events that occur \nafter its termination.\"  Id at 252-53.  Moreover, the Court in \nNolde Bros. found a \"presumption in favor of postexpiration \narbitration of matters unless 'negated expressly or by  clear \nimplication,'  but  that  conclusion  was  limited  by  the  vital \nqualification  that  arbitration  was  of matters  and disputes \narising out of the relation governed by contract.\"  Litton Fin. \nPrinting Div. v. NLRB, 501 U.S. 190,204 (1991) (quoting and \ndiscussing Nolde Bros., 430 U.S. at 255) (emphasis added). \nWith these principles in mind, it is easy to see the district \ncourt did not err when  it held  the  \"agreement to  arbitrate \nmanifested in the DCJV Agreement survives termination of \nthe DCJV Agreement and that it applies to this controversy.\" \nWolff, 503 F. Supp. 2d at 281.  The claims in this case, after \nall, \"can only have arisen from the DCJV Agreement because \nthere  was  no  other  agreement  with  [appellees]  that  Wolff \nentered into.\"  Id  Even assuming a valid trust was created \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 475-1   Filed 04/21/09   Page 20 of 21\n7 \nunder District of Columbia law when the DCJV Agreement \nterminated in  1985, appellants'  claims are \"disputes arising \nout  of the  relation  governed  by  the  contract,\"  Litton  Fin. \nPrinting Div., 501 U.S. at 204, because the Wolffs' ownership \ninterest in the land and the building-the res of the alleged \ntrust-was created under the DCJV Agreement.  We conclude \nthat the agreement to arbitrate \"any dispute which may arise \nduring construction and management of the  office building \ncomplex\" survived the  expiration of the  DCJV Agreement \nand compels appellants to submit their claims to arbitration. \nThe remainder of appellants' arguments can be dismissed \nin short order.  Appellants' unclean hands argument goes to \nthe merits of their claims rather than their arbitrability.  There \nis  no  allegation  that  appellees  have  unclean  hands  with \nrespect to  the  agreement to  arbitrate  itself.  \"[I]n deciding \nwhether  the  parties  have  agreed  to  submit  a  particular \ngrievance to arbitration, a court is not to rule on the potential \nmerits of the underlying claims.\"  Air Line Pilots Ass 'n, 402 \nF.3d at 1248; see also Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin \nMfg. Co., 388 U.S. 395,406 (1967) (allegation of fraud in the \ninducement of a contract is arbitrable, at least absent a claim \nof fraud in the inducement of the agreement to arbitrate).  The \ndistrict  court  did  not  abuse  its  discretion  in  refusing \nappellants'  request  for  discovery  under  Rule  56(f)  of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  The appellants failed to \ndemonstrate,  both to the  district court and on appeal,  how \ndiscovery  related  to  the  merits  of the  claims  would  have \nassisted them in opposing the motion to compel arbitration. \nAppellants also argue that the DCN Agreement's arbitration \nclause lacks sufficient detail as to the material terms of the \nagreement.  This argument, which was not presented to the \ndistrict court, is not properly before us.  See,  e.g., Albrecht v. \nComm.  on  Employee  Benefits  of Fed.  Reserve  Employee \nBenefits Sys., 357 F.3d 62,66 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (argument not \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 475-1   Filed 04/21/09   Page 21 of 21\n8 \npresented to the district court ordinarily waived on appeal); \nDistrict a/Columbia v. Air Florida, Inc., 750 F.2d 1077, 1084 \n(D.C.  Cir.  1984) (same) (citing cases).  The same is true of \nappellants'  argument  that  the  district  court  erred  by \ndismissing this case rather than staying it under Section 3 of \nthe Federal Arbitration Act; no one requested a stay from the \ndistrict court. \nIII. \nAccordingly, the order of the district court compelling \narbitration and dismissing the complaint is \nAffirmed. \nJ ",

That Order provides that “[a]t six month intervals during the three year period of required \nimplementation, the District of Columbia shall issue a report regarding measures taken to \nperform the requirement of the Settlement Agreement section (III)(B), “Changes to Policies and \nPractices.”  The District is pleased to report to the Court that it is in compliance with the agreed \nupon terms of the settlement agreement with respect to each provision.  The specific provisions \nare set forth below with corresponding updates with respect to measures taken to perform the \nactions required: \n 1. Document Management System and Protocol; Evidence Indexing and Logging \nRequirements.  Commencing not later than 120 days following the Court's final approval of \nsettlement of this matter upon these terms and the exhaustion of any appeals (including any \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 1011   Filed 09/23/13   Page 2 of 10\npetition for writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court), the District of Columbia will develop, \nmaintain and/or implement a document management protocol or system to ensure the \npreservation of records and documents arising from mass demonstrations and protests, and to be \nused also in other litigation brought against the District of Columbia as may be deemed \nappropriate by the Attorney General, encompassing the Office of the Attorney General and the \nMPD Office of General Counsel that provides for the following:  \ni. Maintain an index and log of any documents, items, things, recorded or  \nelectronic/computer/digitized material (hereinafter \"record(s)\") that are directly  \nrelated to a complaint or litigation hold letter for matters arising from mass  \ndemonstrations and protests or other cases as may be deemed appropriate by the  \nAttorney General;  \nii. The index will assign a unique identifier to each record and, if possible, will be  \nnumbered or identified in a continuous or contiguous manner.  One of the intents of  \nthe parties is to provide an internal \"audit trail\" that would alert the District to any  \nmissing records or evidence.  \niii. The indexing for matters arising from mass demonstrations and protests (or other  \ncases as may be deemed appropriate by the Attorney General) is intended as an internal \ncontrol over document management; use of the indexing system described in this section, \n(III)(B)(l), is mandatory for all records received or reviewed in connection with a case for \nmatters arising from mass demonstrations and protests (or other cases as may be deemed \nappropriate by the Attorney General); in the event that, due to the physicality or medium \nof an item, a copy of the item cannot be maintained or stored within a computer-based \ndocument management system, the requirements of above-referenced sub-paragraph (ii) \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 1011   Filed 09/23/13   Page 3 of 10\nstill requires such items to be indexed and logged in an effective manner, i.e. in a central \nhard copy log or a dedicated spreadsheet; and the fact that a record is indexed is not \nintended to establish that the record is discoverable, relevant or admissible;  \niv. Communications that are protected by attorney-client privilege or protected as work \nproduct are not required or intended to be subject to this particular indexing, unless so \ndesired by the District of Columbia in its own discretion;  \nv. Records shall be indexed in the indexing system described and required by section \n(III)(B)(I) as soon as possible upon collection or review.  \nStatus \nAs previously reported, pursuant to D.C. Code § 1-207.31 and 31 U.S.C. § 1537, which \nauthorize the District government to utilize services of the United States government on a \nreimbursable basis, the OAG is using a contract administered by the U.S. Department of Justice \nto develop the OAG document management system for the mass demonstration cases.  The \ncontract provides information technology and automated litigation support services for the \nDepartment of Justice and other agencies.  Under that contract, on January 7, 2011, a task order \nwas awarded to Lockheed Martin Systems, Inc. to develop a mass demonstration document \nmanagement system for OAG that meets all requirements of the court’s order.  Development of \nthe OAG Document Management System began on January 13, 2011. While the original contract  \nwith DOJ (Mega 3) expires at the end of November, 2013, the task order is currently in a re-bid \nstatus.  Lockheed Martin will continue to provide support under the current contract until its \nexpiration; if the award goes to a company other than Lockheed Martin, Lockheed Martin will \ntransition all the work to the new contractor and will be available to assist with the project until \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 1011   Filed 09/23/13   Page 4 of 10\nthe transition is complete.  Thus, the OAG will continue to maintain its document management \nsystem.  \nThe system is centered around a LexisNexis Concordance litigation support system \nmaintained at the OAG.  In any matter for which a mass demonstration complaint is received or a \nlitigation hold letter in a mass demonstration incident is issued, as soon as relevant documents \nare identified (be they hardcopy, audio‐visual media, or electronic in origin) they are gathered \nand forwarded to the OAG Document Management System center for processing.  This is done \npursuant to internal document tracking and handling procedures to be implemented at District \nagencies.  For each document processed, a “universal unique identifier” is assigned.  This \nidentifier has a sequential, non‐volatile field value (not changed when records are inserted into or \ndeleted from a Concordance database) and does not appear on any pages produced from a \ndatabase.  OAG is able to use records included within the document management system to \nrespond to discovery, for which production‐specific Bates numbers will then be assigned to the \nproduced pages.  The produced Bates number ranges will be maintained in the associated, \nuniquely identified Concordance database records in a production history field.  All items which \nare not compatible with the current system, such as video and audio recordings, are inventoried \nand the inventories are loaded into the system.  \nThe system has been developed using OAG-owned equipment and will be operated and \nmaintained within OAG’s offices.  As part of the system development, OAG has to date \npurchased and installed an additional $51,000 of software on its existing document scanning and \ncomputer systems, and an additional $3,300 for hardware.  OAG has also continued to purchase \nrenewals of the Law Maintenance Agreement as needed since the system was purchased.  \nDocuments from the Barham/Chang litigation and other related mass demonstration cases \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 1011   Filed 09/23/13   Page 5 of 10\ncontinue to be maintained with the Concordance system and the system is being used for \nongoing discovery-related production in the Chang litigation.  \n \n2. \"Litigation Hold\" Procedures and Practices to Prevent Loss or Destruction of Evidence. \nCommencing not later than 120 days following the Court's final approval of settlement of this \nmatter upon these terms, the OAG shall issue policy statements mandating that upon written \nnotice of likely litigation and/or request to preserve documents and records pertaining to alleged \npolice misconduct involving or relating to mass demonstrations or protests, the OAG shall \naffirmatively direct in writing and ensure that all documents, records, items, videos or computer \nfiles relating to the underlying incident be preserved and affirmatively protected from destruction \nfor a period of no less than three (3) years.  \"Notice of likely litigation and/or request to preserve \ndocuments and records\" is any notification in writing to the Chief of Police, or the Mayor; and/or \nservice upon the Office of the Attorney General of a civil action complaint for matters alleging \npolice misconduct involving or relating to mass demonstrations or protests.  The contractual \ndefinition used herein of \"notice of likely litigation and/or request to preserve documents and \nrecords\" is not intended to alter the meaning of those terms of art as may be used by established \nreported case law precedent in the District of Columbia.  \nStatus \nAs previously reported, OAG issued a mandatory policy to the Civil Litigation Division.  \nThe attorneys in the Civil Litigation Division are responsible for defending all litigation \ninvolving mass demonstrations.  OAG has updated the portion of its Civil Litigation Division \n(“CLD”) manual which addresses litigation hold requirements to include the procedures which \nmust be followed when written notice is received of likely litigation and/or request to preserve \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02283-EGS-JMF   Document 1011   Filed 09/23/13   Page 6 of 10\ndocuments and records pertaining to alleged police misconduct involving or relating to mass \ndemonstrations or protests.  The CLD manual is maintained internally on the OAG’s intranet and \nis available to all staff.  In addition, the Attorney General issued a directive to the MPD Chief of \nPolice informing the Chief of the Metropolitan Police Department’s obligations related to \nlitigation hold procedures pursuant to this Court’s Order.  The Executive Office of the Chief of \nPolice (EOCOP) has a system for tracking incoming mail.  All legal matters received by \nEOCOP, including notices of likely litigation, are forwarded to the Office of the General Counsel \n(OGC).  OGC has issued its own policy statement regarding litigation hold requirements for \nmass demonstration cases.  In keeping with the Barham agreement and the Court’s order, the \npolicy mandates that for notices forwarded to OGC alleging police misconduct involving or \nrelating to mass demonstrations or protests, litigation hold letters shall be issued by OGC to \nMPD, and copies of the notices shall be forwarded to OAG to ensure that all other agencies \nimplicated by the notices receive litigation hold letters from OAG.  \n \n3.

Plaintiffs claim\nviolations of their First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendment\nrights, as well as false arrest, imprisonment, and conversion.\nPending before the Court is defendant District of Columbia’s\nMotion for a Protective Order pertaining to a Rule 30(b)(6)\ndeposition noticed by the plaintiffs.  Upon consideration of the\n\nmotion, the response and replies thereto, the applicable law, and\nthe entire record, the Court GRANTS the motion. \nI. BACKGROUND\nThe D.C. Circuit’s January 13, 2006 opinion details the\nevents at Pershing Park on the morning of September 27, 2002, the\naftermath of such events, and the involvement of the District of\nColumbia Metropolitan Police Department (“MPD”).  See Barham v.\nRamsey, 434 F.3d 565 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  Discovery has been\nongoing in this case for several years and the case is now\nnearing a posture for trial. \nOn October 30, 2007, plaintiffs filed a Notice of Deposition\npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(b)(6) stating\ntheir intent to depose individuals designated to testify on\nbehalf of the District of Columbia Office of the Attorney General\n(“OAG”).  The District of Columbia now moves the Court for a\nprotective order pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n26(c) to limit the scope of the noticed deposition.  Plaintiffs’\nnotice seeks to inquire about three topics relating to the\narrests.  Defendant’s motion concerns only topics one and three. \nSpecifically, topic number one inquires about the “decision...to\nprosecute or not prosecute those persons arrested at Pershing\nPark on September 27, 2002 and the reasons therefore.” Topic\nnumber three seeks information regarding the “creation of Notices\n2\n\nof Infraction for persons arrested on September 27, 2002.” Pl.s’\nJoint Notice of Deposition, at 2-3. \nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(1) provides that “a\nparty may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged,\nthat is relevant to the claim or defense of any party....\nRelevant information need not be admissible at the trial if the\ndiscovery appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery\nof admissible evidence.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1).  The Rule goes\non to state that a party may seek a protective order from the\nCourt, upon a showing of good cause, to protect the party “from\nannoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense”\nby ordering, inter alia, “that certain matters not be inquired\ninto, or that the scope of the disclosure or discovery be limited\nto certain matters....” Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c).  It is pursuant to\nthis provision that defendant seeks a protective order, limiting\nthe scope of plaintiffs’ noticed deposition to prohibit any\ninquiry under topic number one (the decision not to prosecute\nclass members) and allowing only limited inquiry under topic\nnumber three (the creation of Notices of Infraction)1.  \n1 The Court relies on defendant’s representation in its\nreply to the Barham plaintiffs’ opposition that some inquiry will\nbe allowed regarding the creation of the Notices of Infraction so\nlong as the questions do not implicate the OAG’s decision not to\nprosecute plaintiffs.  See Def.’s reply at 4. (“Conversely, to\nthe extent that inquiry in this area may not be related to\ndecisions whether or not to initiate prosecutions, the District\n3\n\nIII. ANALYSIS\n In support of its motion for a protective order, defendant\ncontends that topics number one and three of the Notice of\nDeposition improperly inquire into areas protected by\nprosecutorial immunity.  Defendant argues that because a\nprosecutor’s decision to initiate prosecution is subject to\nabsolute immunity, they are equally shielded from discovery into\nthe basis for that decision.  The Court agrees.\nIn initiating a prosecution and in presenting the State's\ncase, prosecutors are absolutely immune from civil suits for\ndamages.  Imbler v. Patchman, 424 U.S. 409, 431 (1976).  To hold\notherwise would “prevent the vigorous and fearless performance of\nthe prosecutor's duty that is essential to the proper functioning\nof the criminal justice system.” Id. at 427-28. “The purpose of\nconferring absolute immunity is to protect officials not only\nfrom ultimate liability but also from all the time-consuming,\ndistracting, and unpleasant aspects of a lawsuit, including\ndiscovery.” District of Columbia v. Jones, 919 A.2d 604, 611\n(D.C. 2007).  \nPlaintiffs contend they are neither alleging prosecutorial\nmisconduct nor seeking recovery from the District based on the\nprosecutors’ decisions, and therefore immunity is not implicated. \nThe Court rejects this overly narrow view of the absolute\nwill produce witnesses on Topic Number 3.”) \n4\n\nimmunity conferred on prosecutors performing advocacy functions. \nThe reason absolute immunity defeats a case at the outset, as\nopposed to after trial, is in part to spare the official the\ntribulation and expense of defending the suit at all.  Requiring\nprosecutors to defend their prosecutorial discretion in a\nlitigation setting, regardless of whether they are the named\ndefendants, implicates the same concerns the Supreme Court\narticulated in Imbler.  Namely, the Court feared that “harassment\nby unfounded litigation would cause a deflection of the\nprosecutor's energies from his public duties, and the possibility\nthat he would shade his decisions instead of exercising the\nindependence of judgment required by his public trust.” Id. at\n423.  See also Gray v. Poole, 243 F.3d 572, 576 (D.C. Cir. 2001). \nAs the parties in this case are well aware, discovery in civil\nactions can be a lengthy and burdensome experience.  This Circuit\nhas observed that “[e]ven the need to find the time and money for\na defense would have a chilling, if not paralyzing, effect on an\nofficial's willingness to speak out, in the exercise of his\ndiscretion, to further the public interest.” Expeditions\nUnlimited Aquatic Enter., Inc. v. Smithsonian Inst., 566 F.2d\n289, 292 (D.C. Cir. 1977). \nThe Court finds that the principles of prosecutorial\nimmunity are meant to ensure that neither the specter of damages\nliability nor the litigation process itself weakens the\n5\n\nprosecutor’s ability to engage in the “vigorous decision-making”\nrequired by the office.  See Moore v. Valder, 65 F.3d 189, 193\n(D.C. Cir. 1995). \"Whether to present a case to a grand jury,\nwhether to file an information, whether and when to prosecute,\nwhether to dismiss an indictment against particular defendants,\nwhich witnesses to call, and what other evidence to present are\nadvocatory decisions” and thus absolutely immunized.  Id. at 193\n(citing Imbler, 424 U.S. at 431 n. 33). Because topic number one\nof plaintiff’s Notice of Deposition inquires directly into these\nimmunized decisions, the Court finds that a protective order is\nwarranted.  In so far as questions under topic number three make\nsimilar inquiries, they will be likewise prohibited. \n IV. CONCLUSION\nThe information sought in topics number one and three of\nplaintiffs’ Notice of Deposition dated October 30, 2007 is\nprotected by prosecutorial immunity.  Accordingly, defendant’s\nmotion for a protective order is GRANTED.  An appropriate order\naccompanies this opinion. \nSigned: Emmet G. Sullivan\nUnited States District Judge\nNovember 21, 2007\n6",
