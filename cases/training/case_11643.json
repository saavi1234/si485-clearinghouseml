    "summary": "<p>In this case, the Supreme Court ruled in 1999 that Americans with Disabilities Act's ban on disability discrimination forbids the unnecessary institutionalization of people with disabilities.  This has been an enormously important holding, spawning masses of litigation, much of it seeking to substitute community care for institutionalization for people with intellectual disabilities and mental illness.  The case has been called the \"Brown v. Board of Education\" of people with disabilities, because of its call for integration not segregation.  </p><p>The underlying lawsuit began in May 11, 1995, when a developmentally disabled woman filed a complaint against various Georgia state officials under 42 U.S.C. §1983, ADA §§12131-12134 and Due Process Clause in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division.  The plaintiff, represented by public services counsel, asked the Court for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that despite the professional judgment of her psychiatric treatment team, she no longer required in-patient psychiatric treated but instead needed community-based services, defendants had continued to confined at Georgia Regional Hospital (GRH).  Specially, she alleged that her continued unnecessary confinement violated her rights to freedom from undue restraint, minimally adequate treatment, freedom from illegal discrimination, and placement in the most integrated setting appropriate to her needs.  An additional plaintiff was permitted to interven in January 29, 1996; this plaintiff, a 43-year-old developmentally disabled woman, alleged that she was confined unnecessarily and inappropriately at GRH and sought release into a community-based program.</p><p>On March 26, 1997, the Court (Judge Shoob) granted partial summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs.  The Court held that the State's failure to place the plaintiffs in a community-based treatment program violated Title II of ADA.  In so ruling, the court rejected the State's argument that inadequate funding, not discrimination, accounted for their retention at GRH.</p><p>The defendants appealed.  On April 8, 1998, the 11th Circuit affirmed the District Court's judgment, but remanded for reassessment of the State's cost-based defense.  The appellate court asked the district court to consider, among other things, whether the additional expenditures necessary to treat the plaintiffs in community-based care would be unreasonable given the demands of the State's mental health budget.</p><p>The defendants were not satisfied and sought and obtained review by the Supreme Court. On June 22, 1999, the Supreme Court (Justice Ginsburg) affirmed the decision of the 11th Circuit in substantial part, and remanded the case for further consideration of the appropriate relief. The Supreme Court held that unjustified segregation in institutions is discrimination not only because it perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that people with disabilities are incapable or unworthy of participating in community life, but also because confinement in an institution severely curtails everyday life activities, such as family relations, social contacts, work, educational advancement and cultural enrichment. </p><p>Under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, said Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, delivering the opinion of the court, \"states are required to place persons with mental disabilities in community settings rather than in institutions when the State's treatment professionals have determined that community placement is appropriate, the transfer from institutional care to a less restrictive setting is not opposed by the affected individual, and the placement can be reasonably accommodated, taking into account the resources available to the State and the needs of others with mental disabilities. \"  </p><p>Nonetheless, the Supreme Court held, the states' need to maintain a range of facilities for the care and treatment of individuals with diverse mental disabilities must be recognized.  However, The Supreme Court held that the Eleventh Circuit's remand instruction to consider the cost of providing the litigants with community based services in light of the state's mental health budget was unduly restrictive. In evaluating a state's fundamental alteration defense, courts must consider not only the cost of providing community based care to the litigants, but also the range of services the state provides to others with mental disabilities and its obligation to mete out those services in an equitable manner. If the state shows that immediate relief for the plaintiffs would be inequitable \"given the responsibility the state has undertaken for the care and treatment of a large and diverse population of persons with mental disabilities,\" it will have met the fundamental alteration defense.</p><p>On July 11, 2000, the parties reached a settlement and the Court (Judge Shoob) approved the settlement.  No details on it are available.</p><p></p>",

Non-Binding Mediation and Non-Binding Arbitration \n(1) Introduction \n(a) If a Plaintiff is dissatisfied with a final decision of the Director of \nthe DMHMRSA, or if the response is not timely, she may invoke the non \nbinding dispute resolution mechanism set out below.  This dispute mechanism \nshall have two tiers: a non-binding mediation component and from there to a \nnon-binding time-limited arbitration.  The parties agree that mediation and \narbitration will be conducted by the Justice Center of Atlanta, Inc. under a \nreduced fee arrangement, the provisions of which are set forth in a letter of \nunderstanding between the Justice Center of Atlanta (JCA) and the parties, \nattached as  Attachment A to this agreement. \n(b) In the event that neither procedure resolves the dispute, either party \nmay bring their complaint to either federal district court or to state court, \nwhichever is applicable based upon whether jurisdiction in federal district court \nhas been dismissed under this agreement prior to the initiation of any dispute \nresolution mechanism.  The arbitration decision may be introduced into evidence \nby either party. However, any motion in federal court or action in state court shall \nbe de novo and shall not be solely a review of the non-binding decision nor afford \nit any deference. \n(c) Because the letter of understanding covers a period of five years \nfrom the date that this agreement becomes final, the parties shall meet at least six \nmonths prior to the expiration ofthis five- year period and determine whether to \ncontinue the dispute resolution process as set forth in this agreement or modify it \nin any way that is satisfactory to both parties. \n(d) If at the expiration of the five (5) year period no agreement is \nreached regarding the continuation of a dispute resolution mechanism, Plaintiff \nmay file an action in the  Superior Court of the County of residence of the \nPlaintiff to enforce any provision of this agreement without regard to the \nprovisions of l3.a. (Written Complaints to DHR), 13.b. (Non-Binding Mediation \nand Non-Binding Arbitration), or l3.c. (2) (Enforcement of Agreement). \n(2)  Mediation \n(a) Plaintiff or her attorney will  mail a written request for non-binding \nmediation pursuant to this agreement to the Justice Center of Atlanta, Inc. with \nnotice to the Georgia Attorney General's Office within 10 days after service of \n~ ... \n\\  the final decision of the Director of the DMRMHSA. The mediator shall be \nselected within 10 days ofthe request for mediation. The Plaintiff will then \n8 \n\n( \npromptly commence the mediation within 10 days of the date of the selection of \nthe mediator, unless the parties agree otherwise. \n(b) Prior to mediation, each party shall attempt to provide the other \nparty with a copy of all relevant documents and shall also provide the other with a \nproposal to resolve the dispute.  Mediation shall be confidential and non-binding. \nEach side shall attend, with counsel if they elect, and either accompanied by or \nwith access to such person or person(s) who have authority to resolve the \ndisagreement within the scope of the demand of the other party. \n(c) The parties may enter into a mediation agreement resolving all \ndisputes and which has, inter alia, authority to amend or modify this agreement, \nthe ISP, or to provide for any agreed upon procedure or services or placement. \n(3) Arbitration \nIn the event the dispute is not resolved at mediation, either party \nmay elect within 10 business days of the conclusion of the mediation to seek non \nbinding arbitration by submitting a written request for non-binding arbitration \npursuant to this agreement to the Justice Center of Atlanta, Inc. with notice to the \nGeorgia Attorney General's Office and to the opposing party. The following \narbitration process will be followed: \n(i) The arbitrator will be chosen within 10 days from the date that the \nwritten request for arbitration is submitted to the Justice Center, unless the \nparties agree to extend this period.  The Justice Center of Atlanta will \npropose a list of at least 7 potential arbitrators. with names, addresses and \ntelephone numbers.  The Plaintiff will choose  3 or more arbitrators who \nare acceptable. \n(ii) The Director of the DMRMHSA will choose an arbitrator from \nPlaintiff's list, or else submit three or more additional names from the list \n(iii) Plaintiff may choose an arbitrator from the Director's list if one is \nacceptable. \n(iv) If none are acceptable, Plaintiffwill notify the Director that none are \nacceptable and will choose one name from Plaintiffs previously \nsubmitted  selection. \n(v) The Director will choose one name from his/her previously submitted \nselection. \n(vi) The two selected arbitrators will jointly select and agree on a third \narbitrator, who will be the sole arbitrator ofthe dispute. \n(vii) A record of the arbitration shall not be made though the arbitrator \nshall issue a written determination within ten (10) days of the conclusion \nof the hearing and  serve this on each party or their representative. The \narbitration shall be time limited, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, \n9 \n\nwith each party allowed up to but not in excess of three and one half (3 \n112) hours, including argument.  The following procedures shall be used: \n(a) There shall be no formal discovery; (b) Pre-arbitration motions shall \nnot be made, except either party shall have the right to receive a list of \nwitnesses and documents from the other two (2) business days prior to \narbitration; (3) Each party may use copies of treatment plans, evaluations \nand records without further authentication as long as such documents are \nof the type commonly used by treatment teams and/or evaluators in \ndeveloping ISP or other treatment recommendations; (4) Each party may \npresent and cross-examine witnesses, except that affidavit testimony may \nbe used with consent; and (5) The arbitrator shall resolve any dispute \nconcerning evidence or procedures, and in exercising such discretion, may \nconsult but is not bound to utilize the rules applicable to hearings before \nthe Office of State Administrative Appeals under the Georgia \nAdministrative Procedure Act, allowing for the relaxation of such rules \nand procedures where such a ruling shall facilitate the prompt resolution of \nthe matter, without prejudice to either party. \n(4}All costs and fees relating to the mediation and arbitration shall be \nshared equally by the parties, except that each party shall bear their own costs and \nattorney fees. In the event the claim proceeds into court  and either party has a \nstatutory claim for attorney fees and costs, they may seek such an award, \nincluding the time spent in this dispute resolution procedure. \n(5) During the initial  five -year period  that the Justice Center of Atlanta \nconducts the dispute resolution procedures in this agreement, the rules and \nprocedures governing both mediation and arbitration shall be the rules generally \nemployed by the Justice Center.  Where any such rules or procedures are \ninconsistent with the provisions of this agreement, the provisions of this \nagreement shall apply. \n(6)The parties may at any time agree on an alternative to the dispute \nresolution process described in this subparagraph. \nI3.c.

L.C.,  civil  action \nfile  number  1-95-1210-MHS. \nIn  the  event  that  either  party  to  the  agreement  which  resolves  that  case \n(Settlement  Agreement)  believes  that  there  has  been  a  breach  of  the \nSettlement  Agreement,  the  JCA  agrees  to  mediate  that  claim  for  the  cost \nof  Two  Hundred  Fifty  Dollars  ($250),  the  cost  to  be  split  by  the  parties \nunless  the  parties  agree  otherwise.  The  JCA  will  choose  the  mediator \nwithout  input  from  the  parties  on  that  choice,  and  the  mediation  will  be \nconducted  pursuant  to  the  rules  for  mediation  generally  employed  by  The \nJCA. \nIn  the  event  that  mediation  fails  to  generate  an  agreement  of  all  issues, \nremaining  issues  will  be  addressed  through  non-binding  arbitration \nconducted  by  The  JCA.  The  cost  of  the  arbitration  will  be  an  additional \nTwo  Hundred  Fifty  Dollars  ($250),  again  split  by  the  parties  unless  the \n976 EDGEWOOD AVENUE, NE • ATLANTA, GEORGIA  30307-2580 • 404/523-8236 FAX 404/523-3936 • E·MAIL: jcainfo@justicecenter,org \n\n,  I \nparties  agree  otherwise.

Zimring, Esquire, Guardian Ad Litem in the above \nreferenced matter and hereby files with the Court his Certificate in Support of the Joint \nMotion in regard to the adoption of the  Settlement Agreement and Consent Order presented \nto the Court as a full and final resolution of this case.  In furtherance of that Motion the \nundesigned shows the Court that: \n(1)  He is Court Appointed Guardian Ad Litem. \n(2)  The parties have presented the Court with a motion to adopt a  Consent Order \nand  Settlement Agreement. \nEXHIBIT \nI \nB \n\n(3)  The Settlement Agreement is the result of an arms length negotiated mediation \nbetween the parties, commencing in August of 1999 and reaching resolution \non the 6th day of June, 2000. \n(4)  The Settlement Agreement provides for the dismissal of all appeals. \n(5)  The  Settlement Agreement maintains this Court's jurisdiction for three years \nto  enforce  the provisions  of the  Settlement  Agreement,  with described \nprocedures and exceptions, and results in an ultimate dismissal of all claims. \n(6)  The Settlement Agreement addresses the continued provision of community \nbased services for PlaintiffL.C. and for PlaintiffE.W.  In addition, it provides \na mechanism for evaluation and development of appropriate placement and \ntreatment  plans,  review  of records,  input  from  State  and  independent \nprofessionals  as  to  necessary  services,  a  dispute  resolution  mechanism \nincluding mediation, non-binding arbitration and  appeal either to this Court, \nor after three (3) years to Georgia Superior Court. The dispute resolution \nmechanism utilizes the Justice Center of Atlanta, at least for the initial years. \n(7)  The Settlement Agreement also settles Plaintiffs' claims for attorneys fees and \ncosts. \nIn the opinion of the Guardian Ad Litem the Settlement Agreement reasonably and \nappropriately addresses the claims of each of the Plaintiffs, and accomplishes the objective \nof having a mechanism for the provision of necessary services. It also provides a mechanism \nto resolve disagreements between each Plaintiff and the State or State service providers.  I \n-2-\n\nbelieve it is in the Plaintiffs' interest to accept this Settlement Agreement.  The Settlement \nAgreement  and  Consent  Order  are  endorsed  by  Plaintiffs'  counsel,  including  Susan \nJamieson, Esq., attorney  for each of the Plaintiffs throughout the course of this matter. \nI am not aware of any known objections to the Settlement Agreement or any conflicts \narising from the terms of the proposed settlement. \nI therefore, ask the Court to approve the Order, adopting the Settlement Agreement. \nll-~ay \nThis  of June, 2000. \nRespectfully submitted, \nONATHAN A.

In support of this Motion they assert that the agreement is the result of an extended \nnegotiation process. Court  approval is needed for two reasons: first, the continuing jurisdiction of \nthis Court for a period of three years  is an essential element of the agreement and, second,  the \nCourt has a duty to protect the interests ofthese Plaintiffs in light of their cognitive disabilities. \nHoffert v. GMC 656 F2d 161 (5th Cir. 1981); Steyck v. Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc., 53 F Supp. \n\n2d 794 (B.D. Pa. 1999). \nProcedurally, the part of the case that is before this Court is on remand from the United \nStates Supreme Court, which found as follows: \nWe affirm the Court of Appeals' decision in substantial part.  Unjustified isolation, we \nhold, is properly regarded as discrimination based on a disability.  But we recognize, as \nwell, the States' need to maintain a range of facilities for the care and treatment of persons \nwith diverse mental disabilities, and the States' obligation to administer services with an \neven hand.  Accordingly, we further hold that the Court of Appeals' remand instruction \nwas unduly restrictive. \nOlmsteadv. L.e., 572 U.S. 581,597, 119 S.Ct. 2176,2185, 144 L.Ed. 2d 540 (1999).  The \nCourt thus affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded, with instructions as to the ADA's \n\"fundamental alteration\" defense. Id However, since the relief sought by the two Plaintiffs has \nbeen achieved to a degree satisfactory to the parties through a comprehensive settlement \nagreement, further litigation of the fundamental alteration issue in this case is unnecessary. \nThe agreement provides for ongoing treatment and community services. It does not \npreclude necessary facility treatment, followed by a return to community services and placement \nwithin a reasonable time.  It includes prompt resolution without litigation of disagreements in the \nimplementation of the agreement's terms. This Court retains jurisdiction to enforce the agreement \nfor three years, including any disputes pending at the end of the three-year period.  After three \nyears, the agreement may be enforced in the proper superior court in Georgia. Finally, the parties \nhave resolved all issues with regard to attorneys' fees. \nThe individual appointed by this Court as guardian ad litem for both Plaintiffs believes that \nthe agreement \"reasonably and appropriately addresses the claims of each of the Plaintiffs .... \" See \nCertificate of Guardian Ad Litem, \" attached to Motion as Exhibit B. \nThe parties therefore ask this Court to incorporate the settlement agreement providing, \n2 \n\n, \nf \n\",  \n'\" \ninter alia, for ongoing community-based services to L.C. (Lois Curtis) and E.W. (Elaine Wilson) \nin to its final order. \nI  6---\nThis J~ day of June, 2000. \n~#(  .~---u--\nI  Susan C.

The type \nof  program  that  EW.  needs  exists  in  the  community,  and,  in  fact,  a  provider  of \ncommunity services is willing and able to serve E.W. if funding is made available.  (See \naffidavit of Dr. Richard Elliott, 1111  14 and 15, Exh.  1). \n\nWhen E.W.'s Motion to Intervene in this case was granted in late January 1996, \nshe had been hospitalized for more than a year.  By the time that discovery had been \ncompleted at the end of June 1996, it was apparent that the Defendants had made no \nprogress  toward  identifying  a  community  placement  for  E.W.  Defendants'  own \nprofessionals agree that E.W. can be served in a more integrated, community program. \nHer physician,  Dilipkumar Patel,  M.D.,  presents  Plaintiff's  own  inquiry  to  this  Court \nsuccinctly: \nQ.  If you were aware of a provider who could meet her needs in the \ncommunity, would you be in favor of placing her in the community? \nA.  Yes, why not? \n(Patel dep. at 76, I. 25, 77, I.  1-4, Exh. 2). \nThe abject failure of the Defendants to so place E.W. violates the Americans With \nDisabilities Act and its implementing regulations which provide that  [a] public entity shall \nII \nadminister services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate \nto the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d) (Emphasis \nII \nadded).  While  Defendants  illegally  refuse  to  integrate  E.W.  into  an  appropriate \ncommunity placement, her condition continues to deteriorate.1 \n'This case was filed initially on May 11,  1995 by Plaintiff L. C. who was also \ninstitutionalized at GRH-A despite qualifying for a community placement as admitted \nby Defendants' own treatment staff.  After Plaintiff filed two motions for temporary \nrestraining orders, Defendants finally placed L. C.  in a community residential program \nin February 1996 where L.C.  has begun to adjust successfully to life outside an \ninstitution. \n2 \n\nSTATEMENT OF fACTS \n~.  PlA~NTIFf E.W.'s H~STORY AND CURRENT PUGHT \nE.W., age 43,  is mentally retarded.  As an infant at about one year of age, she \ncontracted meningitis accompanied by a high fever that left her with brain damage.  She \nattended special schools as a young child, but her behavior problems eventually could \nnot be managed at home.  At age 15, she was placed at Gracewood, a state institution \nfor the mentally retarded, where she remained for five years. \nAfter E.W. was discharged from Gracewood in 1975, she tried to survive on her \nown  in  Atlanta  but  after  another  lengthy  institutionalization  at  a  state  hospital  in \nMilledgeville, Georgia, a pattern soon developed of multiple admissions to GRH-A.  E.W. \nhas  had  over thirty admissions  to  GRH-A  in  the  past twenty years.  (See  Exhibit 3 \nattached to Parrish dep. and identified at 40,  I.  25 - 44,  I. 9-14, Exh. 10). \nAs  a  result of E.W.'s  lengthy institutionalization,  Dr.  DeBacher,  a GRH-A  staff \npsychologist, now believes that E.W.: \n. . . has become so worn out in this environment that she would benefit \nfrom a complete change of scene to help her climb out of her depreSSion \nand take a renewed  interest in  life.  Our hospital was never intended for \nlong-term  habilitation  (except  OLe  which  serves  lower  functioning \nretardates), and our relatively Spartan physical and social environment is \nintended  to  inspire  patients  to  return  quickly  to  life  outside.  [t  is \nunavoidably lacking as a long-term growth environment. \n(DeBacher evaluation of E. W.  at 6,  91  4,  Exh.  12). \nE.W.  needs an  appropriate,  supervised  placement in  a community  residential \nprogram rather than repeated,  prolonged, and  unnecessary institutionalization in state \npsychiatric hospitals.  Dr. OeBacher, in his evaluatio'n, specifically noted that the hospital \n3 \n----------------\n- --\n\nenvironment  was  counter-productive  for  E.W.  and  that  E.W.'s  needs  relating  to \nsocialization, vocational rehabilitation, and behavioral learning could be adequately met \nonly in an integrated community program with appropriate supports and staff.  (DeBacher \neval.,  Exh.  12).  He was also clear that it is only the lack of an  available community \nalternative that explains E.W.'s lengthy psychiatric institutionalization: \nQ.  If you had a home provider who said they would be willing to take \nher,  do you think it would be a good idea to  give her a try in the \ncommunity? \nA.  You mean a staffed group home or just an individual provider? \nQ.  A staffed group home that can provide the things you indicated a \ngroup home should do. \nA.  Sure, yeah. \nQ.  At what point do you think it would have been good to try? \nA.  Well, as soon as we would have known about such a place and had \nabout a  month  to  prepare to,  you  know,  based  on  her current \nsituation and  let her see the place;  let them get to know her;  talk \nabout contingencies; trial visit there for a while; you know, give her \nsome encouragement for doing okay. \n(DeBacher dep. at 46, I.  6-23, Exh. 14). \nDr.  DeBacher,  in  assessing  E.W.,  reviewed  the  report  of  Dr.  June  Kaufman, \nanother psychologist who, according to Dr. DeBacher, \"has considerable experience in \nevaluating developmental disabilitiesll  (DeBacher eva!.  of E. W.  at 2,  91  5,  Exh.  12).  Dr. \nKaufman also concluded that E.W. IIneeds to have a highly structured residential home \nappropriate for an individual with mental retardation and behavioral/emotional deficits. \nShe also  needs  to  be involved  in  a sheltered  workshop  program  appropriate for  a \nmentally retarded individual who has been institutionalized many times due to possible \n4 \n\ninappropriate  placements.\"  (Kaufman  evaluation  of  E.W.  at  4,  \"Summary  and \nRecommendations,  Exh.  15). \nII \nDrs. DeBacher and Kaufman are not the only persons who believe E.W. can be \nplaced successfully in the community.  As noted above, her treating physician, Dr. Patel, \nfavors placing her in the community with proper supports.  (Patel dep. at 25, I.  16-22; 33, \nI.  2-5;  75,  I.  9-21;  76,  I.  25 - 77,  I.  4,  Exh.  2).  Similarly,  Charles Bliss, the social work \nsupervisor at GRH-A who is responsible for coordinating E.W.'s treatment believes that \nE.W. does not belong in the hospital except during an acute crisis.  (Bliss dep. at 47, I. \n18; 48, I.  13, Exh. 3).  Joseph Steed, a behavioral consultant with the Defendant Fulton \nCounty  Regional  Board  who  is  responsible  for  making  placement  assessments, \nconcluded  that  E.W.  could  be  placed  in  a  group  home  that  provided  appropriate \ntreatment.  (Steed dep. at 61,  I.  7-9; 65,  I.  19-22; 66, I.  5,  Exh. 4). \nFinally, Dr. Richard Elliott, an expert in both mental health and mental retardation \nretained by Plaintiffs in this case has stated unequivocally that E.W. should be placed in \nthe community and that specific providers exist who can  provide E.W.  the necessary \nservices.  (Aff. of Dr. Richard Elliott, 111111  and  15, Exh.  1; Elliott dep. at 29,  I.  6-10; 77, \nI. 14-24, Exh. 5).  Virtually everyone agrees that capable providers exist in the community. \n(Patel dep. at 26, I.  20-21, Exh. 2;  DeBacher dep. at 29, I.  8-10, Exh. 14; Ingram dep. at \n16, I.  14-16; 33,  I.  6-8,  Exh.  6).  Indeed, one specific provider who is aware of E.W.'s \ntreatment and habilitation needs would be happy to serve E.W. and is capable of doing \nso.  (Elliott Aff.,  111114 and 15, Exh.  1). \n5 \n\nDespite  the  weight  of  opinion  that  E.W.  can  and  should  be  provided  an \nappropriate community placement, it has not occurred due simply to Defendants' refusal \nto fund it.  Dr.  DeBacher testified that private companies could provide the necessary \nservices if the funds were made available and  that a staffed  group home could have \nbeen tried at the end of summer 1995 if it had been available.  (DeBacher dep. at 29, I. \n1-22; 46, I. 6-23; 47, I.  1-7, Exh. 14). \nDefendant Fields testified that persons are often ready for the community but are \nnot placed due to lack of funds.  (Fields dep. at 61, I.  19-23, Exh. 7).  Yet, he noted that \n90% of the Mental Health, Mental Retardation, and Substance Abuse Division's dollars \ngo to hospitals, leaving only 10% for community placements.  (1.9..  at 65, I.  1-8).  This is \ntrue despite the Georgia legislature passing House Bill 100, O.C.G.A. § 37-2-1  et seq., \nin 1993 giving the Mental Health, Mental Retardation, and Substance Abuse Division of \nDHR the authority to move more monies from hospitals to community services.  O.C.G.A. \n§ 37-2-5.1 (c).  The vision behind H.B. 100 was that this transfer of monies would actually \noccur so that more peoplewould be served in the community at less cost.  (Elliott dep. \nat 122, l.  1-6, Exh. 5). \nA simple example of how community care costs less in the long-term can  be \nshown by looking at the Mental Retardation Waiver Program.  This program is designed \nto allow states to  place people in less  expensive community placements who would \notherwise be eligible for care in  an  intermediate care nursing facility for the mentally \nretarded  (ICF/MR).  42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c).  For the fiscal year 1997, Georgia projected \nthe  average  per  capita  annual  costs  for  ICF/MR  placement  (mental  retardation \n6 \n---= ..... \n:a. ....... ~ '-'.  ...... \n\ninstitutional  care)  to  be  $72,267  and  for  the  Mental  Retardation  Waiver  Program \n(community placement) to be $39,359.  (Excerpt from Georgia's Section 1915(b) Waiver \nRequest, Appendix C2jC3, Exh.  19).  However, community placement supervisors are \nreluctant  to  use  this  program  because  they  believe  it  would  require  the  state  to \npermanently close institutional beds. (Bliss dep. at 34,  I.  2-3, Exh. 3). \nWillie Ingram who is the Director of the Disabled Learning Center (DLC) at GRH-A2 \nand  Defendant Olmstead have supplied additional information comparing the relative \ncosts of institutional care and community care for the mentally retarded.  Mr. Ingram has \ntestified that the Medicaid waiver program per diem cost for community placements is \napproximately $118 to $124.  On the other hand, the per diem cost for institutional care \nat the OLe is $283.  (Ingram dep. at 58, I.  1-7; 59,  I.  4-6, Exh. 6).  On an annual basis, \ntherefore, institutional care for the mentally retarded costs more than twice as much as \ncommunity care, or almost $60,000 more per person per year. \nWith  respect to  the cost of care for the mentally  ill,  Defendant  Olmstead  has \nprovided information showing similarly dramatic differences in cost.  The cheaper \"adult \npsychiatric\" per diem rate for institutional care at the Treatment Unit of GRH-A is $232 or \n$84,680 on an annual basis.  The more expensive \"extended care\" per diem cost is $505 \nor $184,325 per year.  (Defendant Olmstead's Answer to Plaintiffs' Interrog. No. 21, Exh. \n18).  As with care for the mentally retarded, the cost of institutional care for the mentally \nill is substantially more expensive than the cost of community care. \n2GRH-A has two primary units, the Disabled Learning Center and the Treatment \nUnit.  The Disabled Learning Center is charged with providing care for the mentally \nretarded.  The Treatment Unit is charged with providing treatment for the mentally ill. \n7 \n\nc· \nCharles  Hopkins,  a  program  consultant  for the  Division,  admitted  that  more \npersons could be served if the state allocated more money to match substantial available \nfederal dollars. Although the federal government has authorized matching federal dollars \nto fund 2,109 community placements through the Medicaid waiver program, the State \nof Georgia is using only 700 of those slots.  (Hopkins dep. at 18, I.  14-19; 19, I. 3-6, Exh. \n8). In addition to these and other dollars, the Division has $300,000 in discretionary funds \nthat can be used for community placements.  (Hopkins dep. at 24,  I.  14-18, Exh. 8). \nInstead  of funding  more  community  placements,  the  Division,  as  noted  in  a \nDivision press release which Defendant Olmstead assumed was accurate, employs and \npays for 99% of its  11,000 employees to work in  state institutions  rather than  in the \ncommunity.  (Olmstead  dep.  at  71,  I.  5-9,  Exh.  9).  Defendant  Olmstead  also \nacknowledged that although hospitals could be down-sized and still fulfill their mission \n(id. at 51,  I.  22-25),  over the last four years, funding for mental retardation community \nresidential services has decreased by almost $3,000,000 and mental health supportive \nliving funding  has decreased  by over $12,000,000.3  At the same time,  mental health \ninstitutional funding has increased by over $19,000,000.  (lQ.  at 23, I.  23-25; 24, I.  1-10). \nThese significant changes occurred  after the Georgia legislature passed  H.B.  100 to \nencourage more spending for community services and  less spending for institutional \ncare. \n3Mental retardation community residential funding is used for actually placing a \nmentally retarded person in a residential setting.  Mental health supportive living \nfunding is used for actually placing a mentally ill person in a residential setting. \n8 \n\nBecause of these funding decisions, the only actual community placements EW. \nhas received  have  been  in  personal care homes which  provide room  and  board  to \nmentally ill persons with very limited income, typically Supplemental Security Income. \nDefendant's own staff admit that these homes do not provide the appropriate level of \ntrained supervision and support that E.W. needs.  (DeBacher dep. at 22,  I.  19-25, Exh. \n14; Parrish dep. at 35,  I.  3-5; 66,  I.  3-5 & 11-16; 78,  I.  13-23; 79,  I.  2-5, Exh.  10). \nMore specifically,  Jimmie Parrish,  E.W.'s case manager from  October 1994 to \nAugust 1995, candidly admitted that E.W.'s placement at the Ponce Manor personal care \nhome on December 29,  1994 was inappropriate.  (Parrish dep. at 65,  I.  9-13, Exh.  10). \nAs a result of this  placement,  E.W.  had  to  be re-hospitalized.  Similarly,  Mr.  Parrish \nadmitted that EW.'s placement at the Stewart Avenue personal care home four days later \nfl\non January 4, 1995, where the home provider fltried to pray the demons out of her , was \ninappropriate.  (Id. at 69, I. 7-11).  As a result of this experience, E.W. was re-hospitalized \non January 17, 1995.  Shortly thereafter, on February 7, 1995, E.W. was placed at Graves \nPersonal Care Home.  (1.9..  at 75, I.  1-13).  At this point, Mr. Parrish admits that he did not \neven know what constituted appropriate placement (id. at 77, I.  14-15) but acknowledged \nthat E.W. had not been placed in appropriate programs that would break the cycle of re \nhospitalizations.  (L9.  at 78,  I.  3-23). \nMr. Parrish also admits that E.W.'s problem was related to her mental retardation, \nyet no mental retardation  program  was  even considered for E.W.  In  fact,  when  Mr. \nParrish was assigned the task of seeking mental retardation services for E.W.,  he did \nnothing.  (Id.  at 79,  I.  11-14).  Mr.  Parrish  also  admits that  he  did  not  know if any \n9 \n\n(. \npersonal care homes,  including the placements described  above,  could  provide the \nnecessary behavioral management seNices for E. W.  (l9..  at 83, I.  8-24; 84,  I. 8-16), yet \nE.W. was so placed anyway because Mr. Parrish still did not know of any personal care \nhomes that provided those seNices.  (l9. .. at 78,  I.  13-20; 79,  I.  2-5). \nGiven that E.W.'s treatment staff knew from the outset that E.W. needed seNices \nin the community that the personal care homes admittedly could not provide, it should \nhave come as no surprise that those placements failed.  Rather than search for providers \nwho could supply appropriate seNices or furnish the necessary funding to insure that \nsuch  seNices  would  be  provided,  Defendants  next  sought to  discharge  E.W.  to  a \nhomeless shelter.  (Patel dep. at 20,  I.  25; 21,  I.  1-3, Exh. 2;  Parrish dep. at 94, I.  9-12, \nExh.  10).  This is a common practice when patients have no income.  (Parrish dep. at \n92, I. 20 - 94,  I.  25, Exh.  10). \nThe discharge to a homeless shelter was planned with no provision for mental \nhealth _s eNices,  mental  retardation  services,  or  medical  services  for  E.W.'s  urinary \nincontinence.  Several persons on E.W.'s treatment team later acknowledged that such \na placement was inappropriate and would probably result in re-hospitalization.  (Parrish \ndep. at 96,  I.  11  - 97,  I. 3,  Exh.  10; Steed dep. at 93,  I.  8-11,  Exh. 4;  Bliss dep. at 86, I. \n5-9, Exh. 3).  Plaintiff's expert, Dr.  Elliott strongly agrees.  (Elliott dep. at 97,  I.  19 - 99, \nI.  3,  Exh.  5).  Fortunately for E. W.,  the planned  placement was aborted when present \ncounsel for E.W. objected. \nAfter  the  attempted  discharge  to  a  homeless  shelter  was  thwarted,  case \nmanagement staff met in April  1995 and  directed the case manager,  Mr.  Parrish,  to \n1 0 \n\nexplore other placement options that would include mentally retarded services.  From \nApril  1995 to September 1995, however,  Mr.  Parrish admitted that he made no such \nefforts.  (Parrish dep. at 106, I.  12 - 109, I.  20, Exh.  10).  Ms. Bess Ligon, who replaced \nMr. Parrish as E.W.'s case worker in September 1995, similarly did nothing for months, \nfailing to even speak with Defendant Shepard of the Fulton County Regional Board until \nFebruary 1996.  (Ligon dep. at 10, I.  2-6; 28,  I.  17-25; 29, I.  1-2, Exh.  13).4 \nAs of this date, E.W. has not been placed in the community.  In the meantime, her \ncondition  is  deteriorating.  (Steed  dep.  at  70,  I.  22-24,  Exh.  4).  It will  continue to \ndeteriorate if E.W.  is not given appropriate services including a community placement. \n(Elliott aft. at crrcrr  12 and 16, Exh.  1). \nWith  no end  in  sight to her inappropriate isolation and  segregation at GRH-A, \nE.W.,  in the past four months has become increasingly unhappy and frustrated.  On \nMarch 20, 1996, for example, this entry appears in her hospital record, \"Patient requests \nto write in her chart that she wants to be discharged .... Memo will be left under Patel's \ndoor.\"  (GRH-A record, progress note, March 20,  1996, Exh. 11).  On several occasions, \nshe has tried to leave the institution and was returned  to  her treatment unit by facility \npolice.  One of the consequences for these \"AWOL\" attempts has been a reduction in \nE.W.'s \"level\" so that she has even less freedom within the institution.  She has tried to \n4The Regional Board was and is responsible for community placements under \nthe Medicaid waiver program for mentally retarded persons.  Interestingly, Ms. Ligon's \nefforts, other than one unanswered telephone call in November 1995, did not begin \nuntil shortly after this court granted E.W.'s Motion to Intervene in this case on January \n29,  1996. \n11 \n\nleave GRH-A at least four times since the beginning of April 22,  1996.  (GRH-A record, \nprogress notes, April 23, 27, May 7, and June 21,  1996, Composite Exhibit 11). \n~t  PROGRAMS THAT MEET E.W.'S NEEDS EXIST IN THE COMMUN~nr \nThe  most  obvious  example  in  this  litigation  of the  existence  of  appropriate \ncommunity programs is the placement where L.C., the original Plaintiff in this case, is \ncurrently  residing.  It  is  a  24-hour  staffed  residence  operated  by  a  team  with  wide \nexperience in mental retardation.  The staff support services are funded, in part, through \nthe Mental Retardation Waiver Program (MRWP) described earlier.  The MRWP provides \na  flexible  funding  mechanism  for  providing  needed  community  services,  including \nresidential services, to mentally retarded adults so that they can leave more expensive \ninstitutional care and reside in the community. \nL.C.'s case management services are provided through ACCESS, a community \nbased mental health program which has psychiatric outreach workers and a psychiatrist. \n(Thornton dep. at 41,  I.  22-25; 42, I.  1-15, Exh.  16).  During the day, L.C.  is engaged in \nsupervised work, leisure, socialization, and educational activities.  (See Access Plan, Exh. \n17). \nCommunity  mental  retardation  and  mental  health  programs  have  existed  in \nGeorgia for many years, although Georgia has continued to rely heavily on expensive, \ninstitutional  programs.  In  addition  to  the  MRWP  program,  there  are  community \nresidential programs and other community services for mentally ill persons.  (Defendant \nOlmstead's Answers to Plaintiffs' Interrog. Nos.  2-8,  Exhibit 18).  Plaintiffs' expert,  Dr. \nRichard Elliott, as already noted above, has specifically identified one such program that \n1 2 \n\nis familiar with E.W. and is willing and capable of serving her.  (Elliott aff. at crrcrr  14 and \n15,  Exh.  1).  Despite  the  existence  of  these  programs,  their  cost-effectiveness  as \ndescribed earlier, and E.W.'s eligibility for these programs, Defendants refuse to act.  In \nthe meantime, E.W.  continues to languish at GRH-A losing hope that she will ever live \nin the community and receive the services that she needs. \n1 3 \n\nARGUMENT AND CITAT~ON Of AUTHOR~nr \nt  STANDARD fOR GRANTiNG A PRELIMiNARY ~NJUNCT~ON \nUnder Fed. R. Civ. P. 65, Plaintiff E.W. is entitled to a  preliminary injunction if she \ndemonstrates  (1)  a  substantial  likelihood  of success  on the  merits;  (2)  a  threat of \nirreparable injury if the preliminary injunction is not granted; (3) an irreparable injury that \noutweighs the harm the preliminary injunction will cause to the Defendants; and (4) the \npreliminary injunction  is  in  the  public interest.  Ingram v.  Ault,  50  F.3d  898  (11th  Cir. \n1995); Bakerv. Buckeye Cellulose Corporation, 856 F.2d  167, 169 (11th Cir.  1988). As \nwill more fully appear below,  Plaintiff E.W.  meets these standards and is entitled to a \npreliminary injunction in this case. \n~L  E.W. ~S SUBSTANTIALLY LIKELY TO PREVAIL ON THE MERITS \nPlaintiff  is  substantially  likely  to  succeed  on  the  merits  of  her  claim  that \nDefendants' refusal to place her in an appropriate integrated community setting rather \nthan  isolating and  segregating  her in  a mental  hospital violates  her rights  under the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101  et seq. \nA.  DEFENDANTS  ARE  VIOLATING  THE  ADA  BY  UNNECESSAR~lY \nSEGREGATING PLA~NTIFF E.W. IN A STATE MENTAL HOSPITAL \n1.  The ADA: lis Background, History, and Purpose \nThe ADA is a major and comprehensive civil rights law designed to address this \ncountry's  history of rampant discrimination against the disabled.  The  United  States \nCongress  recognized  that  discrimination  against  the  disabled,  often  in  the  form  of \nsegregation and isolation, is a pervasive social problem.  See 42 U.S.C. § 12101 (a)(2). \n14 \n\nThus,  after  three  years  of  debate  and  numerous  hearings,  the  Congress  passed \nlegislation, which in the words of the House Judiciary Committee, \" ... promises a new \nfuture: a future of inclusion and integration, and the end of exclusion and segregation.\" \n1990 U.S. Code Congo and Admin. News 445, 449. \nTitle II of the ADA states that: \n... no qualified individual with a disability, shall by reason of \nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied \nthe benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public \nentity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity. \n42 U.S.C. § 12132.  In passing this provision, Congress explicitly \nstated its purpose: \nTo provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for \nthe  elimination  of  discrimination  against  individuals  with \ndisabilities. \n42 U.S.C. § 12101 (b)(1). \nThe  purpose  of Title  II  of the  ADA  and  its  anti-discrimination  provision  was \nsupported by strong congressional findings of wide-spread discrimination, segregation, \nand isolation of persons with disabilities with  no legal  recourse.  Those findings were \ncodified in the Act itself: \n(a)  Findings \nThe Congress finds that -\n(2)  Historically,  society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with \ndisabilities, and, despite some improvements, such forms of discrimination \nagainst individuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive \nsocial problem; \n(3)  Discrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical \nareas  as  employment,  housing,  public  accommodations,  education, \n15 \n\ntransportation,  communication,  recreation,  institutionalization,  health \nservices, voting, and access to public services; \n(4)  ... (I]ndividuals who  have  experienced  discrimination on the basis  of \ndisability have often had no legal recourse to redress such discrimination; \n(5)  Individuals  with  disabilities  continually  encounter  various  forms  of \ndiscrimination, including outright intentional exclusion, ... overprotective \nrules and  policies, failure to make modifications to existing facilities and \npractices, exclusionary qualification standards and criteria, segregation, and \nrelegation to lesser services, programs, activities, benefits, jobs, or other \nopportunities; \n(8)  The  Nation's proper goals  regarding  individuals  with  disabilities are to \nassure equality of opportunity,  full  participation,  independent living.  and \neconomic self-sufficiency for such individuals .... \n42 U.S.C. § 12101 (a)(2), (3),  (4),  (5)  and (8)  (Emphasis added). \nThe legislative history resolves any doubt that could possibly remain regarding the \npurpose of the ADA to prohibit segregation and unnecessary institutionalization of the \ndisabled.  Numerous members of the House and Senate expressly stated their support \nfor an end to segregation and isolation of the disabled through passage of the ADA. \nFor example, Senator Harkin, floor manager of the ADA in the Senate, stated that \nthe ADA  IIguarantees  individuals  with  disabilities  the  right  to  be  integrated  into  the \neconomic and social mainstream of society; segregation and isolation by others will no \nlonger be tolerated.\"  135 Congo  Rec.  19803 (1989)  (Emphasis added). \nIn  a similar vein,  Representative Collins  stated that the \"basic goal which  runs \nthrough this landmark civil rights legislation ... is to fully integrate disabled Americans \ninto all aspects of life in our country.\"  136 Congo Rec. 11430 (1990) (Emphasis added). \nCongressman  Miller  recognized  that  \"it  has  been  our unwillingness to  see all \npeople with disabilities that has been the greatest barrier to full and meaningful equality. \n1 6 \n\nSociety has made them invisible by shutting them away in segregated facilities.1I  136 \nCongo Rec. 10877 (1990) (Emphasis added). \nSenator Kennedy argued that the ADA would  put an  end  to this unnecessary \nsegregation: lithe Americans with Disabilities Act will end this American apartheid.  It will \nroll back the unthinking and unacceptable practices by which disabled Americans today \nare segregated,  excluded,  and  fenced  off from  fair participation in our society.\"  135 \nCongo  Rec. 8514 (1989)  (Emphasis added). \nLast, and perhaps most eloquently, Senator Lowell Weicker, the original sponsor \nof the  ADA  and  a former  Chair  of the  Senate  Subcommittee  on  the  Handicapped, \ntestified  before  that  committee  that  the  intent  of  the  ADA  was  to  end  isolation, \nsegregation, and discrimination: \nFor  years  this  country  has  maintained  a  public  policy  of \nprotectionism  toward  people  with  disabilities.  We  have \ncreated  monoliths  of  isolated  care  in  institutions  and  in \nsegregated  educational  settings.  It  is  that  isolation  and \nsegregation that has become the basis of the discrimination \nfaced by many disabled people today.  Separate is not equal. \nIt was not for blacks; it is not for the disabled. \nAmericans with Disabilities Act:  Hearing Before the Senate Comm. on Labor and Human \nResources and  Subcomm.  on  the  Handicapped,  101st Cong.,  1st Sess.  215  (1989) \n(Emphasis added). \nThe overwhelming  legislative history,  of which the above is  a small sampling, \ncoupled  with the ADA's language and  congreSSional  findings WOUld,  in the words of \nSenator Harkin:  lIensure once and  for all that no  Federal  agency or judge will  ever \n1 7 \n\nmisconstrue the congressional  mandate to  integrate people with disabilities into the \nmainstream.1I  135 Congo Rec. S4985 (daily ed. May 9,  1989). \nSenator  Harkin's  comment  was  addressing  Congress'  view  that  the  federal \nagencies responsible for implementing Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and \nmany courts had frustrated the primary purpose of that Act,  i.e., to end segregation of \ns \nthe disabled.  The ADA was passed to cure this problem.\n2.  The Integration Regulations Implementing the ADA \nTo provide even further insurance that the ADA would be properly construed and \nimplemented to end segregation of the disabled, Congress required the Attorney General \nto issue regulations which tlshall be consistent with [the ADA] and with the coordination \nregulations under part 41  of title 28,  Code of Federal  Regulations ... applicable to \nrecipients of federal financial assistance under section 794 of title 24 [Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973].\"  42 U.S.C. § 12134(b) (Emphasis added). \nThe  Section  504  coordination  regulations  contain  the  \"[g]eneral  prohibitions \nagainst discriminationll with a specific requirement that \"[r]ecipients [of federal financial \nassistance]  shall  administer  programs  and  activities  in  the  most  integrated  setting \nappropriate to  the  needs  of qualified  handicapped  persons.\"  28  C.F.R.  §  41.51 (d) \n(Emphasis added). \n5Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act had been the law for seventeen years, \nyet, as stated by Representative Wolpe, \"millions of Americans with disabilities are still \nsubjected to widespread discrimination and segregation in all significant areas of their \nlives. II  136 Congo  Rec.  H2627 (daily ed. May 22,  1990).  And Congress itself stated in \nits findings contained in the ADA that discrimination against the disabled, including \nisolation and segregation IIcontinue to be a serious and pervasive social problem.\"  42 \nU.S.C. § 12101 (a)(2). \n18 \n\nThe Attorney General complied with the congressional command and enacted an \nADA Title II  integration regulation which provides that: \nA  public  entity  shall  administer  services,  programs,  and \nactivities  in  the most integrated  setting  appropriate to  the \nneeds of qualified individuals with disabilities. \n28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d) (1995)  (Emphasis added). \nThus, the Attorney General issued a regulation in which the failure to integrate is \ndiscrimination .Qy itself.  Significantly, this stand-alone requirement is unlike other Section \n504 regulations in which the integration requirement is linked to differences in services \nprovided to individuals with disabilities and those without disabilities.  For example, the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services Section 504 regulations require integration \nonly in the context of providing services for disabled individuals that are equal to services \nprovided for individuals without disabilities.  See 45  C. F. R.  § 84.4(b)(2)  (1993).  The \nSection 504 coordination regulations do not require this linkage. \nAs noted above, Congress also required the Attorney General to issue Title II ADA \nregulations  \"consistent  with\"  the  rest  of the  ADA.  The  Attorney  General's  Title  II \nregulation meets this requirement.  For example, Title I of the ADA defines \"discriminate\" \nto include segregation of employees with disabilities.  42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(1).  Title III \nprohibits discrimination in the form of failing to provide services \"in the most integrated \nsetting appropriate to the needs of the individual,lI  42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(1)(B).  This Title \nIII integration requirement is independent of and separate from other provisions in Title \nIII  prohibiting different treatment in providing services to disabled people compared to \nservices provided to non-disabled people.  42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(1)(A)(ii), (iii). \n19 \n\n(, \nIn summary, the Attorney General's Title II integration regulation is consistent with \nthe ADA and the Section 504 coordination regulations as required by Congress.  The \nfailure to integrate the disabled is  discrimination Qy itself.  The Attorney General  has \nadvocated this position in other litigation, including Helen L. v. DiDario, 46 F.3d 325 (3rd \nCir. 1995), cert. denied, 116 S.  Ct. 64, \nIn  mandating  administration  of  seNices  in  \"the  most  integrated  setting,\" the \nAttorney  General  has  described  that  setting  as  one  \"that  enables  individuals  with \ndisabilities to interact with nondisabled persons to the fullest extent possible.\"  28 C.F.R. \nPart 35,  App. A at 454.  According to the Attorney General, this requirement was \"an \nimportant and overarching principle of the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Separate, \nspecial, or different programs that are designed to  provide a benefit to  persons with \ndisabilities cannot be used  to  restrict the participation of persons with  disabilities in \ngeneral, integrated activities.  lQ.  at 452.  Thus, the Department of Justice summarized \nII \nthe meaning and intent of the ADA implementing regulations to prohibit exclusion and \nsegregation: \nTaken  together,  these  provIsions  are  intended  to  prohibit \nexclusion and segregation of individuals with disabilities and \nthe denial of equal opportunities enjoyed  by others,  based \non, among other things, presumptions, patronizing attitudes, \nfears,  and  stereotypes  of  individuals  with  disabilities. \nConsistent with these standards, public entities are required \nto insure that their actions are based on facts applicable to \nindividuals and  not on  assumptions as  to what a class  of \nindividuals with disabilities can or cannot do. \nIntegration is fundamental to the purposes of the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act. Provision of segregated accommodations \nand  seNices  relegates  persons  with  disabilities to  second \nclass status. \n20 \n\n(, \n\\  .. r \nId. at 451  (Emphasis added). \nThis commentary to the reg ulations is consistent with the report of the House \nJudiciary Committee which emphasized integrated seNices: \nAs  with  Section  504  of  the  Rehabilitation  Act,  integrated \nseNices are essential to accomplishing the purposes of Title \nII.  As stated by Judge Mansmann in ADAPT v.  Skinner, \"the \ngoal [is to] eradicate the 'invisibility of the handicapped.''' .. \n. . Integration is fundamental to the purposes of the ADA. \nH.R.  Report No. 485,  101st Cong., 2nd Sess., pt. 3 at 50, 56 \n(Emphasis added). \nAs will  be shown  below,  E.W.  has  been  excluded,  segregated,  isolated,  and \ndiscriminated against based  upon her disability by the Defendants in violation of the \nexpress  language  of  the  ADA,  the  express  language  of  the  ADA's  implementing \nregulations, and the express intent of the U.S. Congress summarized above. \n3.  E.W. Is a Qualified Individual With a Disability \nWithin the Meaning of the ADA, Is ~he Victim of \nDiscrimination by a Public Entity, and Has Been \nDiscriminated Against Based Upon Her Disability \nIn order to prove a violation of Title II  of the ADA, Plaintiff must demonstrate the \nexistence of three elements: (1) that she is a \"qualified individual with a disability\"; (2) that \nshe was the victim of discrimination by a public entity; (3) that such discrimination was \nby reason of a disability.  See Concerned Parents to Save Dreher Park Center v. the City \nof West Palm Beach, 846F. Supp. 986, 990 (S.D.  Fla.  1994). \na.  E.W. Is Clearly a Qualified Individual With a Disability \nThe  ADA  defines  a  disability  as  \"(A)  a  physical  or  mental  impairment  that \nsubstantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual; (B) a record \n2l \n\n(. \nof such impairment;  or (C)  is regarded as having such an impairment.\"  42  U.S.C. § \n12102(2)(A)-(C).  E.W. is mentally retarded and suffers from a personality change due \nto early childhood meningitis.  She attended special schools throughout her childhood \nincluding Gracewood, a state institution for the mentally retarded.  She has been in and \nout of mental institutions throughout her twenty-five years of adult life with over thirty \nadmissions to GRH-A.  She clearly suffers from disabilities that substantially interfere with \nmajor life activities.  She also has a long record of suffering from these impairments and \nhas  long  been  regarded  as  suffering  from  such  impairments.  She  is  therefore  an \nindividual with a disability within the meaning of the Act. \nE.W.  is also a qualified  individual  under the ADA.  Not only does she have a \ndisability within the meaning of the Act, she qualifies for the community services which \nshe seeks in this case.  See Martin v. Voinovich, 840 F. Supp. 1175, 1191-92 (S. D. Ohio \n1993).  (Persons  with  mental  retardation  or  developmental  disabilities  who  could \nparticipate in a community residential services  program were considered  qualified for \nsuch services under the ADA.)  The Qefendants have admitted on numerous occasions, \nas documented in E.W.'s medical records and  in the depositions of Dr.  DeBacher, Dr. \nPatel, Charles Bliss, and Joseph Steed, that she needs or is suitable for a community \nplacement outside the hospital.  By  Defendants own admissions,  E.W.  is qualified for \ncommunity-based treatment.  This view is also supported by Plaintiff's expert, Dr. Richard \nElliott. \n22 \n\n( \nlb.  De~ell1ldlBlIl1l~S HBlVe DHscll'nmnmn~edl Agalnll1ls~ E.W. Iby COIl1l~um!luIl1lQl ~(\\)) \n~Il1lS~n~lUI~n(mal~nZe alll1lo1  Segll'egal~e Hell' nll1l  al  Mell1l~al~ HoslPn~al~ \nThe text of the ADA,  its legislative history,  and  its implementing regulations as \nalready discussed above unequivocally establish a national mandate to end unnecessary \nsegregation and institutionalization of persons like E.W. and to integrate such persons \ninto society at large to the greatest extent possible.  The Act,  legislative history,  and \nimplementing regulations make equally clear that when Defendants fail to comply with \nthis mandate, they commit discrimination. \nSpecifically,  the  ADA's  implementing  regulations  require  a  public  entity  \"to \nadminister its services, programs and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate \nto the needs\" of persons such as E.W.  See 28 C.F.R. § 135.130(d) (Emphasis added). \nHere, the State of Georgia has undertaken to  provide services and programs for the \nmentally retarded and mentally ill.  Once it undertook to do so,  it became obligated to \nprovide those services in the most integrated setting appropriate to E.W.'s needs.  The \nstate's own doctors and treatment staff have admitted repeatedly that E.W. is eligible for \nplacement outside an institution in a more integrated setting.  Their failure to so place \nher violates 28 C. F. R.  § 35. 130( d) and the ADA. \nSeveral  court  decisions  have  strongly  affirmed  the  point  that  unnecessary \nsegregation is discrimination per se.  The best example is the recent case of Helen L. v. \nDiDario, 46 F.3d 325 (3rd Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 116 S. Ct. 64 (1995) which concluded: \nThus,  the ADA  and  its  attendant regulations  clearly define \nunnecessary segregation as a form  of illegal discrimination \nagainst the disabled.  Accordingly, the district court erred in \nholding that the applicable provisions of the ADA 'may not be \ninvoked unless there is first a finding of discrimination.' \n23 \n\nId. at 333. \nOther  decisions  interpreting  the  ADA  and  its  predecessor,  §  504  of  the \nRehabilitation Act,  have reached  the same conclusion.  See Halderman v.  Pennhurst \nState Sch. and Hosp., 784 F.  Supp. 215,  224 (E.D.  Pa.  1992), aff'd, 977 F.2d 568 (3rd \nCir.  1992)  (Section  504  prohibits  unnecessary  segregation  and  requires  reasonable \naccommodations to provide opportunities for integration); Coleman v. Zatechka, 824 F. \nSupp. 1360,1373 (D. Neb. 1993) (in enacting the ADA, Congress \"aimed to bring people \nwith disabilities into society's mainstream, to cause the kinds of interaction which may \nfacilitate  recognition  of the  true  equality  of  human  worth  as  between  individuals  -\nregardless of disabilities. \") ; Jackson v.  Ft.  Stanton Hospital and Training School, 757 F. \nSupp. 1243, 1299 (D. N.M. 1990), aff'd in part, rev'd in part. on other grounds, 964 F.2d \n980 (10th Cir.  1992) (\"Where reasonable accommodations in community programs can \nbe made, Defendants' failure to integrate severely handicapped residents into community \nprograms ... violates Section 504\"); Homeward Bound, Inc. v. Hissom Memorial Center, \n1987 WL 27104 at *20  (N.D. Okla. July 24, 1987) (\"Section 504 prohibits unnecessarily \nsegregated  services for retarded  persons\");  Ga.  Association of Retarded  Citizens v. \nMcDaniel, 511  F. Supp. 126, 128 (N.D. Ga. 1981) (state school superintendent's refusal \nto consider needs of handicapped children violates § 504). \nViolation of the ADA does not require any proof of intent to discriminate.  As noted \nrecently by the Third Circuit in the DiDario case: \n[bJecause the ADA evolved from an attempt to  remedy the \neffects of \"benign neglect\" resulting  from the \"invisibilityll of \nthe disabled, Congress could not have intended to limit the \nAct's protections and prohibitions to circumstances involving \n24 \n\ndeliberate discrimination.  Such discrimination results from \n\"affirmative animus\" which was not the focus of the ADA ... \n. Rather,  the ADA  attempts to  eliminate the effects of that \nll \n\"benign neglece, lIapathyll, and lIindifference .... [T]he ADA \nmake[s] clear that the unnecessary segregation of individuals \nwith disabilities in the provision of public seNices is itself a \nform of discrimination. \n46 F.3rd at 335 (Emphasis added).  The language quoted by the DiDario court came \nfrom a Supreme Court decision construing the analogous Rehabilitation Act in which the \nSupreme Court noted that \"[d]iscrimination against the handicapped was perceived by \nCongress  to  be  most  often  the  product,  not  of  invidious  animus,  but  rather  of \nthoughtlessness and indifference - of benign neglect.\"  Alexander v.  Choate,  469 U.S. \n287,295,105 S. Ct. 712, 717, 83 L. Ed. 2d 661  (1985);  see also Concerned Parents, 846 \nF.  Supp. at 991  (\"Certainly intentional discrimination is banned by Title II.  But further, \nactions that have the effect of discriminating against individuals with disabilities likewise \nviolate the ADA.\"  Emphasis in original.);  Mayberry v.  Von Valtier,  843 F.  Supp.  1160, \n1166 (ED. Mich.  1994)  (\"Congress appears to have intended the ADA to address the \nlI\ndiscriminatory effects of benign action or inaction, as well as intentional discrimination. ) \nAs noted above, the ADA prohibits only unnecessary segregation.  Public entities \nmay  provide  different  seNices  to  persons  with  disabilities  if  \"necessary  to  provide \nqualified individuals with disabilities with aids, benefits, or services that are as effective \nas those provided to others.\"  28 C,F,R, § 35. 130(b)(1 )(iv) (1995) (Emphasis added),  The \nDepartment  of  Justice,  which  promulgated  this  regulation,  has  indicated  that  this \nexception  to  the  general  rule  of integration  is  a narrow one:  \"[s]eparate,  special  or \ndifferent programs that are designed to  provide a benefit to  persons with  disabilities \n25 \n\ncannot  be  used  to  restrict  the  participation  of persons  with  disabilities  in  general, \nintegrated activities.1I  28 C.F.R.  Part 35,  App. A at 452.  Furthermore, a person with a \ndisability retains the right to participate in the regular program \"despite [the] existence \nof permissibly separate or different programs.\"  28 C.F.R. § 35. 130(b)(2) (1995). \nDefendants have the burden of showing that separate or segregated services are \nnecessary to  provide effective services.  The' state can do this  only after making an \nindividualized determination of E.W.'s needs.  28 C.F.R.  Part 35, App. A at 452. As the \nDepartment of Justice has noted,  [t] he starting point is to question whether the separate \nII \nprogram is in fact necessary or appropriate for the individual.\" lQ..  (Emphasis added.) \nThe Defendants in  this case cannot meet their burden.  They  have repeatedly \nacknowledged  that  E.W.  no  longer  requires  institutionalization  and  is  eligible  for a \ncommunity  placement.  They  have  completely  failed,  however,  to  place  her  in  a \nresidential  supervised  setting  with  appropriate  services.  They  have  therefore \ndiscriminated against E.W. within the meaning of the ADA. \nFinally,  Plaintiff  is  not  required  to  show that  she  has  been  denied  access  to \nservices as a disabled person that are available to the nondisabled.  In other words, \nsimply because Plaintiff seeks access to services that are available only to persons with \ndisabilities does not alter the analysis.  The key is the plain language of the ADA which \nprohibits  unnecessary segregation and  isolation of individuals with  disabilities.  That \nalone constitutes discrimination. \nThus, courts have rejected the argument that discrimination occurs only if disabled \npersons are denied services that are available to the nondisabled.  DiDario, 46 F.3rd at \n26 \n\n335  C'  ... the ADA makers] clear that the unnecessary segregation of individuals with \ndisabilities in the provision of public services is itself a form of discrimination within the \nmeaning of those statutes, independent of the discrimination that arises when individuals \nwith  disabilities  receive  different services than  those  provided  to  individuals  without \ndisabilities.\"); Martin v. Voinovich, 840 F.  Supp. at 1191-92. \nIn summary, by unnecessarily segregating and institutionalizing EW., and failing \nto provide an appropriate community placement, Defendants have thereby discriminated \nagainst her within the meaning of the ADA. \nc.  Deiell1ldants Have Discriminated Against E.W. Based \nUpon Her Disability \nPlaintiff has established that Defendants have discriminated against her under the \nADA by unnecessarily excluding,  segregating,  and  institutionalizing  her.  In  order to \nprevail under the ADA, however, Plaintiff must also show that Defendants have excluded, \nsegregated, and institutionalized her \"by reason of [her] disability\".  42 U.S.C. § 12132. \nDefendants have unquestionably done so. \nE.W. is mentally retarded and suffers from a personality change due to a medical \ncondition,  meningitis.  She  has  been  institutionalized  at  GRH-A  for these conditions \nduring her most recent admission since February 1995.  She has spent the better part \nof her adult life for the past twenty-five years in mental institutions or special placements. \nThe GRH-A Treatment Unit,  where  EW. currently  resides,  houses only persons with \nmental disabilities.  Thus, E.W. has been placed at GRH-A \"by reason of her disability.\" \nDefendants  may  attempt  to  claim  that  they  can  keep  Plaintiff  at  GRH-A  or \ndischarge her to a homeless shelter because they lack funds to place E.W. in a proper \n27 \n\ncommunity  residential  setting  with  the  necessary treatment  and  services.  Such  an \nargument would be legally and factually insupportable. \nFirst,  such an argument would  really  be nothing  more than an  argument that \nDefendants have not intentionally discriminated against E.W.  Plaintiff has already shown \nin Section II(A)(3)(b) of this brief,  however, that the ADA does not require an intent to \ndiscriminate. \nSecond, continued institutionalization based upon lack of funds has already been \nrejected by the DiDario  case in the face of an ADA claim.  46 F.3d at 338. \nThird, just as in DiDario, a claim of lack of funds would be factually insupportable. \nThe approximate cost of placing E.W.  in an appropriate community residential setting \n($39,000 to $72,000) would be substantially less than the amount spent each year to \nwarehouse her at GRH-A ($84,000 to $184,000). \nFourth, in a similar context, the United States Supreme Court has held that cost \nconsiderations  do  not  justify  discriminatory  conduct.  International  Union,  UAW  v. \nJohnson Controls, 499 U.S.  187,210,111 S.  Ct.  1196, 1209, 113 L.  Ed.  2d  158 (1991) \n(liThe  extra  cost of employing  members  of  one  sex,  however,  does  not provide an \naffirmative Title VII defense for a discriminatory refusal to hire members of that gender.lI) \nIt has also long been the law of this circuit that a state may not fail to provide \ntreatment for budgetary reasons alone.  Wyatt v. Aderholt, 503 F.2d 1305, 1315 (5th Cir. \n1974)  As  noted  in  the  Wyatt  case,  [H] umane  considerations  and  constitutional \nII' \nrequirements are not, in this day, to be measured or limited by dollar considerations, \n'II \nquoting Jackson v.  Bishop,  404 F.2d  571,  580  (8th  Cir.  1968).  See also  Concerned \n28 \n\nc· \nParents to Save Dreher Park Center v.  City of West Palm  Beach,  846 F.  Supp at 993 \n(liThe expenditure of funds cannot be considered a harm if the law requires it.\"); Kroll v. \nSt.  Charles  County,  766  F.  Supp.  744,  753  (ED.  Mo.  1991)  (If  county did  not fund \nbuilding  improvements  required  under the ADA  within  two  months,  the Court would \nconsider the imposition of a property tax increase, or an injunction of a rollback of local \ntaxes to assure funding for the improvements). \nIn International Union, the Supreme Court particularly noted that Congress had \nconsidered the substantial cost of providing equal treatment under Title VII, but required \nequal treatment nonetheless.  111  S.  Ct.  at 1209.  Similarly, Congress,  in passing the \nADA, also considered cost considerations.  It acknowledged that the ADA might impose \nfinancial burdens on the states but felt that such potential costs were the price that had \nto be paid in order to eliminate discrimination against the disabled.  As Senator Hatch \nstated, the ADA would: \nimpose a lot of expenses and  rightly so.  It is time we did \nthese things.  It is time we brought persons with disabilities \ninto full freedom, economic and otherwise, with other citizens \nin our society.  This bill will do that.  In doing so, we should \nbe aware that it \"is  going to  be costly and  difficult and  that \nthere will be some complaints. \n135 Congo  Rec.  19835 (1989). Senator Harkin echoed this sentiment: \n[F]ocusing on the costs of compliance by covered  entities \nwas  totally  inappropriate  given  the  economic  benefits  to \nSOCiety of reducing the deficit by getting people off of welfare, \nout of institutions, and on to the tax rolls. \n135 Congo  Rec. 8508 (1989)  (Emphasis added). \n29 \n\nr \nOn the other hand, Congress strongly believed that discrimination had its own \ncosts.  As stated in the congressional findings incorporated into the ADA: \nthe continuing  existence  of  unfair and  unnecessary  discrimination  and \nprejudice denies people with disabilities the opportunity to compete on an \nequal basis and to pursue those opportunities for which our free society is \njustifiably  famous,  and  costs  the  United  States  billions  of  dollars  in \nunnecessary expenses resulting from dependency and non-productivity. \n42 U.S.C. § 12101 (a)(9)  (Emphasis added).  In short, the disabled cannot be forced to \nendure the crushing weight of discrimination based upon mere cost considerations. \nTo  summarize,  E.W.  is  a qualified  individual  with  a disability,  is  the victim  of \ndiscrimination by a public entity, and has been discriminated against based upon her \ndisability.  She is therefore substantially likely to prevail on the merits of her claim under \nthe ADA. \nB.  DEFENDANTS ARE VIOLATING THE ADA BY FAILING TO PROVijDE \nINTEGRATED COMMUNITY-BASED SERVICES AS A \"REASONABlE \nMODIFICATION\" UNDER THE ADA. \nAs  already  noted  above,  Defendants  must  administer  their  mental  disability \nservices  in  the  most  integrated  setting  appropriate  to  E.W.  See  28  C.F.R.  § \n35.130(d)(1995).  For  E.W.,  that  setting  is  a  community-based  residential  setting. \nDefendants  must also  modify their  programs to  the  extent that  is  required  to  avoid \ndiscriminating against the disabled: \nA  public  entity  shall  make  reasonable  modifications  in \npolicies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are \nnecessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, \nunless  the  public  entity can  demonstrate that  making  the \nmodifications  would  fundamentally  alter  the  nature  of the \nservice, program, or activity. \n28 C.F.R. § 35. 130(b)(7) (Emphasis added). \n30 \n\nDefendants cannot meet their burden of showing a fundamental alteration in this \ncase.  Defendants already have existing  programs  providing  community services to \npersons such as E.W.  The State of Georgia has established nineteen regional boards \nwhich oversee the provision of all disability services,  including community services, to \npersons with  mental disabilities.  In fiscal year 1995,  the state spent $96,834,822 on \nmental  retardation  community  services,  $112,025,305  on  mental  health  community \nservices, $80,940,807 on mental retardation institutional services, and $131,920,891  on \nmental health institutional services.  (Defendant Olmstead's Answers to Plaintiffs' Interrog. \nNos. 2-9, Exh.  18). \nMoreover,  Dr.  Richard  Elliott has identified  several  potential providers for E.W. \nincluding TOPS (Tailored Options For Person-Centered Support), which has indicated \nthat it could serve E.W. if funds were made available.  (Elliott aff. at 9191  14 and 15, Exhibit \n1; Elliott dep. at 29, I.  6-10; 77, I.  14-24, Exhibit 5). \nWith existing programs and established funding for providing services to persons \nsuch as EW., Defendants cannot demonstrate that any fundamental alteration of their \nprogram is required in order to serve E.W. appropriately in the community.  In a similar \ncontext,  the Third  Circuit has already ruled  that providing community-based  services \ndoes not require a fundamental alteration within the meaning of the ADA. See DiDario, \n46 F.3rd at 337-38; see also Martin v.  Voinovich, 840 F.  Supp. at 1190-91. \n31 \n\nm. \n[P>LA~!NIT~FF IE.W. FACIES A SUBSTANT~Al THREAT OF ~IRREPAIRABllE ~!NIJURV \n~F THE PIREUM~!NIARY ~NJUNCTION is NOT GRANTED \nPlaintiff has suffered over thirty hospitalizations on a locked psychiatric ward at \nGRH-A.  She  has  spent a  considerable  part of twenty-five  years  of adult  life  at the \nTreatment Unit of GRH-A even though Dr.  DeBacher has noted that the Treatment Unit \nat GRH-A \"was never intended for long-term habilitation\" and \"is unavoidably lacking as \na long-term growth environment.\"  (DeBacher eva!.  of E.W.  at 6,  'IT  4,  Exh.  12).  As a \nresult,  E.W.  has quite predictably \"become so  worn  out in  this  environment that she \nwould benefit from a complete change of scene to help her climb out of her depression \nand take a renewed interest in life.\"  (1..Q.) \nDr.  DeBacher's  evaluation  is  consistent  with  the  evaluation  of the  behavioral \nconsultant for the Defendant Fulton County Regional Board who has stated that E.W. is \ndeteriorating over time.  (Steed dep. at 70,  I.  22-24,  Exh. 4). \nDr.  DeBacher's evaluation is also consistent with Dr.  Richard Elliott's evaluation \nwhich concluded that: \nE.W.'s  continued  hospitalization  at  GRH-A  has  and  will \ncontinue to  have a negative  impact on  her treatment and \nhabilitation because it is likely to contribute to her depression, \ndependence, and lack of motivation and because what E.W. \nneeds,  more  than  any  other  single  component  in  her \ntreatment,  is  an  opportunity to  learn  how to  develop  and \nenhance  her  existing  abilities  in  a  community,  rather than \ninstitutional, context. \n(Elliott aff. at 'IT  12, Exh.  1). \nE.W.'s  history  and  present  circumstances  demonstrate that  her condition  will \ncontinue to deteriorate if she is not integrated into the community with adequate services. \n32 \n\nThe endless cycle of discharges and re-hospitalizations will continue until E.W. reaches \nthe point of no return - permanent institutionalization.  This is the very result that the ADA \nwas designed to prevent. \nThe law is well-established in this Circuit that an injury is irreparable if it cannot be \nremedied by monetary damages.  Cate v. Oldham, 707 F.2d 1176, 1189 (11th Cir. 1983). \nThe continued negative impact that institutionalization at GRH-A is having on E.W. cannot \nbe compensated by monetary damages.  In at least one other identical context, another \ncourt has so held.  Daniel B. v. White, No. Civ. 79-4088,  1991 WL 58494 at *3 (ED. Pa. \n1991). \nIn Daniel B., the court specifically found that \"continued institutionalization of the \nclass members, even for a short time, will cause irreparable harm.\"  lQ.  The court so \nfound because the evidence showed that confinement had impeded the class members' \ndevelopment and caused them to regress.  lQ. \nJust as in Daniel B., the evidence in this case shows that E.W.'s condition has \ndeteriorated  while at GRH-A and  will  continue to  deteriorate so  long as  she remains \nthere.  The harm caused to E.W. by her inappropriate institutionalization is immeasurable, \npotentially irreversible, and not compensable in monetary damages. \nIn  another case specifically involving  the ADA,  a court found  that a  group of \ndisabled  citizens  suffered  irreparable  harm  when  a  city  attempted  to  eliminate  city \nrecreational programs for the disabled.  Concerned Parents to Save Dreher Park Center, \n846 F.  Supp.  at 992.  The court so  ruled  because the disabled  would  have a more \ndifficult time creating their own recreational opportunities and because  [t] hese programs, \nII \n33 \n\nr' \nprior to their elimination, were contributing to a sense of emotional and psychological \nwell-beingll that monetary damages could never remedy.  !Q. \nE.W.'s  emotional  and  psychological  well-beingll  has  obviously  been  harmed \nlI\nduring  her  confinement  at  GRH-A.  She  has  suffered  and  will  continue  to  suffer \nirreparable harm so long as she is unnecessarily confined to a locked psychiatric ward \nand  so  long  as  Defendants  refuse  to  provide  her  with  an  integrated  community \nplacement with appropriate services. \n~V.  THE  THREATENED  HARM  TO  PLAINTIFF  OUTWEIGHS  THE  POTENTiAL \nHARM TO THE DEFENDANTS \nThe threatened  harm to E.W.  caused  by Defendants' refusal to place her in an \nappropriate community placement far outweighs any harm the requested injunction may \nhave on the Defendants.  Defendants can show no special harm by integrating E.W. into \nthe community.  In fact, E.W.'s integration into the community would cost less than her \nforced confinement on a mental ward. \nOn  the other hand,  E.W.'s isolation and  segregation at GRH-A is causing her \ncondition to deteriorate, dimming any remaining  hope that she will ever be able to live \nmore  freely,  more  independently,  and  more  productively  in  society.  Without  the \nrequested injunction, E.W. will continue to suffer irreparable injury. \nV.  THE REQUESTED INJUNCTION IS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST \nGranting the requested injunction in this case will promote the public interest. \n. First, the U.S. Congress has unequivocally found, through passage of the ADA, \nthat the public interest is served when the disabled are fully integrated into society rather \n34 \n\nthan shut away in institutions.  Integration is precisely what Plaintiff E.W.  seeks in this \ncase. \nSecond, many states have expressed their view that integrating the disabled into \nsociety is in the public interest.  For example, many states have closed the great majority \nof  their  public  psychiatric  and  mental  retardation  beds  and  reallocated  funds  to \ncommunity-based services. \nThird, the Georgia General Assembly recently gave a strong commitment to the \nneed for community services for the mentally disabled in the State of Georgia by passing \nH.B. 100, a.c.G.A. § 37-2-1 et seq.  That Act specifically recognized the state's obligation \nto meet the needs of the mentally disabled \"through a coordinated system of community \nfacilities,  programs,  and  services,  a,C,G,A.  §  37-2-1 (a).  Most importantly,  the Act \nII \ncreated a new Division of the Department of Human Resources, the Division of Mental \nHealth,  Mental  Retardation,  and  Substance  Abuse,  and  gave  the  Division  the \nunprecedented power to move funds from institutional services to community services. \na.c,G.A. § 37-2-5.2(c)(3). \nFourth, the public interest is best served when discriminatory actions, particularly \nones based upon archaic attitudes and \"pernicious mythologies,  are restrained.  See, \nII \nM.:., Baxter v.  City of Belleville, 720 F.  Supp. 720, 734 (S. D.  III.  1989). \nFinally, the public interest is not served when, with respect to E.W.  in particular, \n... each day that she remains at GRH-A is a day lost forever \nthat could provide her with the opportunity to learn, to work, \nto  experience  life  in  a  reasonably  normal,  supportive \nenvironment,  to  interact  with  non-disabled  individuals,  to \nmake daily choices, and to become a more independent and \nproductive member of society ... \n35 \n\nc \nElliott aft. at ~ 16, Exh. 1. \nIt is time that these Defendants be ordered to conform their actions in accordance \nwith the over-riding public interest calling for integration of the disabled into society. \nCONCLUSION \nFor all of the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff E.W. respectfully requests that her Motion \nbe granted. \n--\"k\"'-i9-----' \nThis IZ-n..  day of  1996. \nRespectfully submitted, \n~ [. ~ C~  vI exp~ \n& \nSUSAN C.

Would  you  agree  that  it's \n13  better  to  address  those  problems  in  the  community \n14  than  in  the  hospital? \n15  A  It's  a  leng-term  problem.  It  could  be \n16  addressed  in  community.  But  I  don't  know  whether  you' \n17  can  call  it addressed  better  in  community.  No,  I \n18  think  it can  be  fully  good  addressed  in  ~ither \n19  outpatient  or  inpatient.  Preferably,  from  the  cost \n20  containment  point  of  view,  I  think  it  could  be \n21  addressed  better  in  the  community. \n22  Q  It would  be  cheeper  to  address  in  the \n23  community? \n24  A  I  don't  expect  it  to  be  cheeper.  It's \n25  probably  come  out  to  be  same  in  that  sense.  But  from \n75 \n\n1. \n.' \n1  the  point  of  view,  they  want  all  the  patients  to  be \n2  treated  as  outpatient. \n3  Q  Okay:  Has  it  -- one  of  the  things \n4,  that  you  indicated  was  that  she  would  nped  a \n5  transition  between  the  hospital  and  an  outpatient \n6  treatment  or  residential  placement. \n.' ,  A  Any  place  that  she  would  go . \n! \n~i  Q  Okay.  In  her  earlier  discharges,  was \n')  there  any  transition  when  she  went  to  the  personal \n10  care  homes,  say  in  January  and  February? \n11  A  That  was  the  time  that  we  would  want \n12  to  try  outpatient  going  in  there  and  seeing  how  she \n13  would  stay  there  and  live  there. \n14  Q  All  right.  So  it's  not  an  involved \n15  process  of  doing  a  lot  of  stuff  to  do  the  transfer. \n16  You  just  take  her  there  and  see  if  it works  out  and \n17  monitor  her  closely  for  a  while.  Is  that  the  sort  of \n18  transition  you're  talking  about? \n19  A  Yes. \n20  Q  So  in  fact,  there, were  transitions \n21  before.  You  were  going  to  monitor  her  in  those \n22  personal  care  home  placements  and  see  how  she  was \n23  doing? \n24  A  That's  correct. \n25  Q  If  you  were  aware  of  a  provider  who \n~ \n76 \n\n/-. \n~  ---------------\n~ \n------------------~( \n\"'\" \nj \n.1 \ni'?l   1  could  meet  who  could  meet  her  needs  in  the \n2  community,  would  you  be  in  favor  of  placing  her  in \n.$ \nl~  \n3  the  community? \n'\\. \n-:.~,.   4  A  Yes;  why  not? \n-2-\", \n.~ \n,,-;;:  5  MR.

One  who  has  been \n,~~ \n7:'; \n::~ \n3  placed  in  a  hospital  46  times  in  the  past  nine  years \n4  clearly  is  having  problems  functioning.  The  fact \n5  that  she  herself  has  stated  that  she  can't  make  it  in \n6  society  only  adds  to  this  notion.  This  is  not  to  say \n7  that  she  couldn't  make  it  someday.  Given  the  correct \n8  treatment  options,  she  could  function  quite  well  in  a \n9  group  home.  An  effective  treatment  plan  would  need \n1 0  the  following  options  at  least  as  a  minimumg  A \n1 1  placement  location  focusing  on  the  treatment  of \n12  mental  illnesses  instead .of  mental  retardation.  This \n.:.... .' . \n13  is  most  likely  one  of  the  reasons  why  E  W  is \n14  currently  in  the  state  she  is;  24-hour  supervision; \n15  regular  medication  checks;  a  strict  program  of \n16  behavior  management  focusing  on  controlling  her \n17  aggressive  behaviors;  and  some  type  of  psychological \n1 8  assistance,  preferably  intensive,  to  get  at  the  root \n1 9  of  many  of  these  behaviors. \n2 0  Q  So  what  you're  saying  is  that  if  you \n2 1  could  find  a  group  home  that  provided  those  types  of \n22  treatment,  she  would  be  okay  for  placement  in  the \n2 3  community? \n2 4  A  Yes. \n2 5  Q  Are  you  aware  of  group  homes  that \nG \n61 \n\n- -\n-------I(~.~-\n1  group  home,  is  that  correct? \n2  A  Right,  if  the  right  people  are  thereo \n3  Q  Then  you  say  some  type  of \n4  psychological  assistance,  preferably  intensive,  to \n5  get  to  the  root  of  many  of  these  behaviorso  What  do \n6  you  mean  by  that? \n7  A  Well,  it was  -- from  reading  the  i \nI \n8  reports  in  the  records  and  also  talking  with  some  of \n9  the  staff,  it was  their  belief  that  basically  E  W  has \n10  had  not  the  best  home  environmento  You  know,  her \n11  mother  has  been  placed  in  jail  before  for  dealing \nt  12  drugs,  there  were  possible  allegations  that  her \n( \n13  father  sexually  abused  hero \n14  And  in  my  experience,  a  lot  of  those  I \nI \nq \n15  behaviors  that  occur  early  on  in  childhood  can  all  1 \n16  can  of  course  cause  difficulties  later  this  lifeo \n'I \n1 \n17  And  it was  my  observation  that  a  lot  of  those \n18  behaviors  have  not  been  discussed  or  gone  into  a  lot \n19  of  detail  with  E  Wo  And  that  if  she  goes  to  a  home \n, \n20  that  that  could  be  done,  then  maybe  some  of  these \n,  21  aggressive  behaviors  would  -- you  know,  would  calm \n1 \n22  down  someo \n23  Q  So  that  kind  of  psychological \n24  assistance  could  be  provided  in  a  community  setting \n25  as  well? \n0 \n65 \n\n(. \n1  A  Right;  that's  something  that  usually \n2  would  need  to  be  done  either  -- in  some  aspects  --\n3  either  going  to  an  outpatient  hospital  and  having \n4  regular  visits  with  a  counselor  or  psychologist, \n5  something  like  that. \n6  Q  Okay.  Going  back  to  the  report,  on \n7  page  2  --\n8  A  Uh-huh.  (Affirmative.) \n9  Q  -- you  say  it  appears  that  E  W \n10  receives  little  or  no  psychological  assistance  for \n11  these  behaviors  on  a  continuing  basis.  What  do  you \n12  mean  by  that? \n13  A  What  I  mean  by  that,  from  looking  at \n14  some  of  the  records  and  just  going  by  some \n15  observations  also,  it  appears  that  while  she's  been \n16  in  the  hospital  whenever  she's  gone  in,  she's  gotten \n17  some  assistance  or  she's  had  her  medications  taken \n18  care  of;  but  apparently,  it  seems  whenever  she's  left \n19  the  hospital  and  gone  back  to  her  group  home  --\n20  whichever  one  it's been  -- that's  when  problems \n~, \ntypically  start  again  because  there's  not  a  lot  of \ncontinuation  there  as  far  as  a  regular  schedule  of \ngetting  counselling,  getting  medication. \n24  Q  Are  you  aware  of  where  her  placements \n25  have  been  when  she's  been  placed  out  of  the  hospital? \n66 \n\n/';, \n-----------------------7( \n~------------------, \n1  somewhere  every  timeo  Because  from  her  diagnosis,  I \ncould  see  that  being  a  problem  if  she  was  having  to \n2 \n3  be  moved  somewhere  every  time  to  go  get  assistanceo \n4  Q  What  about  her  diagnosis;  would  it \n5  make  that  a  problem? \n6  A  Well,  the  fact  that  she  does  have \n7  paranoid  behaviors,  she  might  be  resistant  and \n8  thinking  that  somebody  is  trying  to  take  her  away \nevery  timeo  The  fact  that  she's  leaving  a  familiar \nlocation  might  cause  some  anxiety,  whereas  -- I  know, \ntoo,  for  example,  some  hospitals,  a  lot  of  times  when \nthey  see  a  psychiatrist  or  counselor,  some  hospitals \nin  particular  have  a  history  that  you  don't  see  the \nsame  person  every  timeo \nSometimes  you  might  see  a  different \ndoctor  so  there's  no  chance  for  E  W to  become \nfamiliar  with  the  person  and  build  some  rapport; \nwhereas  if  a  person  came  to  her  place  wher~  she \nalready  feels  comfortable  and  relaxed,  and  it's  the \nsame  person,  she  will  be  able  to  build  some  rapport \n21  and  trusto \n22  Q  All  righto  Is  it your  impression  that \n23  she's  deteriorating  over  time? \n24  A  Yeso \n25  Q  And  what  do  you  base  that  on? \n70 \n\n-----t(-'\"----- -\n.~',~.' \n.. :~.t~, \n~~r~~· \nfi> \n.. \n:\\ \n,,\":?; .. \n..: ~~ .  1  Q  Do  you  know  of  an  occasion  in  which \nit. .  2  they  held  her  down  and  tried  to  pray  the  demons  out \n...  j  3  of  her  in  a  personal  care  home? \n~ \nl \n...- !-;\"' .   4  A  No. \ni \n1 \n.~.  5  Q  Okay.

Is  that \nI.,) \naccurate? \nA  I'm  sorry.  Could  you  say  that  again? \n16  Q  Yes.  As  far  as  the  part  of  your  report  that \n17  actually  reflects  your  interview  and  your  review  of the \n18  records  that  day,  is  that  stated  in  the  history  portion  and \n19  the  mental  status  examination  primarily? \n20  A  Yes. \n21  Q  If- we  could  kind  of  wrap  up  this  part  about  the \n22 \ndocument  review,  did  you  review  any  documents  other  than  what \n23 \nwe've  already  talked  about  today  and  your  interview,  which  is, \n24 \nthe  best  you  can  recall,  the  psychological  reports  that  were \nsent  to  youpr;or  to  the  interview,  the  records  at  the \nI \n\nn \n~  f \nI \n\".:  1\"I   \ni  71 \n.  ~> \n~- . --J~,  \nr~1~,   .?;-, \n~  1  think  a  little different  about  what  would  be  minimally \n..~  <l  ;~. \n'~~ \n,  } \n2  adequate. \n1,1 \nX't \n3  Q  And  you  also  used  the  term  habilitation. \n~s: \nr',~;!'l »-fi;     4  A  Yes. \n',:~,E \n, \n\"-,{~~    5  Q  Define  habilitation  as  you're  using  it  in  your \n:: ,~ \n.:  \"t \n6  report. \n~;J{: \n~,>.I:' \n,~~, \n7  A  Well,  habilitation  consists  of  those  services, \n.:1iff:'1 \n1 \n.!f:'{}: \n~~l-'  8  usually  training,  education  that  develop  a  person's  capacity \n:f~~l \n~; \n~'-\n~~  9  or  to  develop  their  capacities,  their  functioning  ability. \ni'~ \ni~ \n'1 0  It's distinguished  from  rehabilitation  which  are  those \n~.

So,  it's based  on  more \n!O  than  one  program.  It's  based  on  many  programs  and  the  results \n11  are  generalizable  across  programs. \n12  Q  Are  there  any  others  that  you  --\n13  A  Well,  the  Vinelane  model,  I  think  is  a  name  that \n14  people  are  familiar  with.  V-I-N-E-L-A-N-D. \n15  Q  Is  that  a  particular  program? \n16  A  It's a  model  and  there  are  many  people  around  the \n17  country  that  have  used  something  like  the  Vineland  model  to \n18  care  for  people  with  developmental  disabilities  in \n19  communities. \n20  Q  Any  others? \n21  A  Any  others?  Gosh,  off  the  top  of  my  head  I  wouldn't \n22  want  to  -- no,  I  can't  think  of  any  others  off  the  top  of  my \n23  head. \n24  Q  Let  me  go  back  to  the  PACT  program.  No,  let  me  go \n25  back  to  the  Rock  County  Health  Program  that  you  mentioned. \n1 \n\n~  (- (-\n~.l \nI I \nt~1t  \nl \n~~ \nj \n76 \ni \nh~   1  At  that  point,  nobody  had  been  returned  to  the  hospital.

I  wrote  ~bout a  couple  of  the  people.  It \n1 4  was  sort  of  an  ethical  decision  what  might  happen. \n1 5  Q  Which  article was  it? \n1 6  A  That  was  the  Lithium. \n1 7  Q  The  Lithium  article? \n1 8  A  Right. \n1 9  Q  What  about  the  PACT  program,  what  is  that?  Is  that \n20  a  particular  program  or  is  that  a  model? \n21  A  It's  now  a  model.  Originally,  it was  a  particular \n22  program. \n23  Q  And  when  it was  a  particular  program,  what  was  it? \n24  A  It was  the  Program  on  Assertive  Community  Treatment \n25  and  before  that  it was  called  training  in  community  living. \n\n(.-\n77 \n1  And  originally  it was  a  hospital-based  program,  I  think  still \n2  has  some  hospital  bases.  The  notion  is  to  provide  whatever \n3  supports  are  necessary  to  help  people  live  in  the  community, \n4  whatever  support,  whether  it's cooking,  cleaning,  work,  food, \n5  medicines,  whatever  it  is. \n6  Q  Then  you  mentioned  the  Vineland  model,  but  those  are \n7  the  only  program,  per  se,  you've  mentioned.  Is  that  right? \n8  A  When  you  say  programs,  specifically  what  kind  of \n9  programs  are  you  thinking  about? \n. \n10  Q  I  was  following  up  again  on  your  comment  that  there \n1 1  were  many  programs  in  the  country  that  could  provide  minimally \n12  adequate  treatment. \n13  A  Oh,  yes.  Okay. \n14  Q  Were  there  any  others  that  I  overlooked  that  you \n15  mentioned? \n}\" \n16  A  Well,  when  I  was  with  the  state  -- and  I  don't \n17  remember  the  names  of  these  programs,  but  I  had  occasion  to \n.•~..   18  work  with  a  handful  of  programs  even  in  the  Atlanta  area  that \n,-\n.f~· ..  19  seemed  to  care  for  people  with  severe  disability,  sometimes \n;: \n20  severe  head  trauma,  mental  retardation,  severe  and  persistent \n~  :-\n21  mental  illness.  And  there  were  several  of  these  programs, \n22  even  in  Atlanta,  that  seemed  to  have  a  pretty  good  track \n23  record.  I  can't  remember  the  names  of  these  programs  off  the \n24  top  of  my  head. \n25  Q  W~at do  you  remember  about  them  that  would  help  us \n\n(- G-\n97 \n1  A  No. \n2  Q  And  then  you  also  said  she  didn't  have  the  benefit \n3  of  certain  medication  trials  and  those  are  listed  in  your \n4  report. \n5  A  She's  been  tried  on  several  different  medications \n6  but  the  field  is  such  that  there  are  a  good  many  trials  that \n7  have  been  conducted  with  medications  that,  given  the  number  of \n8  times  she's  been  in  the  hospital,  the  number  of  years  she's \n9  . been  in  the  system,  she  should  have  had  a  trial  of  some  of \n10  these  other  medications  to  help  her  with  some  of  these \n1 1  behaviors. \n12  Q  Is  it  possible  that  she  did,  but  you  just  don't  have \n13  the  records  for  those? \n14  A  It's possible.  I  did  ask  her  mother  about  some  of \n15  her  past  treatment  histories  and  it didn't  sound  like  she  had \n16  trials of  some  of  these.  I  believe  she  had  not  had  much \n17  exposure  to  vocational  rehabilitation.  She  had  started  a \n18  behavior  treatment  plan  and  some  vocational  rehab  in  the \n19  several  months  prior  to  my  evaluation.  Given  the  number  of \n20  hospitalizations  and  the  length  of  the  current \n21  hospitalization,  it didn't  appear  to  have  been  a  thoughtful, \n22  planned,  systematic  approach  to  her  habilitation  and  care.  It \nf \n23  had  been  poorly  implemented,  at  least  the  behavioral  plan.  It \nI \n! \nd  24  doesn't  appear  to  have  been  put  together  with  good  baseline \n25  data  and  good  monitoring.  I  believe  with  the  discharge  plan \n\n(-\n98 \n1  last  year  that  led  to  the  staffing  in  April  of  '95,  the  plan \n2  to  discharge  her  to  a  shelter  reflected  a  less  than  minimally \n3  adequate  degree  of  planning  and  concern  for  her  needs. \n4  Q  Is  there  anything  else  that  was  not  -- was  less  than \n5  minimally  adequate? \n6  A  I  could  go  on.  Dr.  Patel's  conclusion  that  what  she \n7  needed  in  the  community  was  referral  to  a  community  mental \n8  health  center  for  treatment  of  her  personality  disorder \n9  reflects  an  inadequate  understanding  of  her  needs  and  here  I'm \n10  referring  to  a  statement  on  page  26  of  his  deposition.  The \n11  question  was  what  sort  of  treatment  would  have  been \n12  appropriate  for  her  in  the  community  at  this  time?  Assuming \n13  she  had  chosen  to  be  treated  in  the  community,  what  sort  of \n14  treatment  would  that  have  required?  His  response  was,  what \n15  sort  of  treatment?  Question,  Yeah,  what  sort  of  treatment  and \n16  what  sort  of  placement  would  that  have  required?  Answer,  Same \n17  kind  of  treatment  that  she  would  require  for  change  of  her \n18  behavior  in  the  hospital.  Question,  And  what  kind  of  -- what \n19  kind  of  treatment  was  that?  Answer,  Out-patient  mental  health \n20  follow  up.  That's  an  example  that  I  think  is  consistent  with \n21  the  treatment  she  had  received  in  the  hospital  most  of  the \n22  time.  That  put  her  generically  into  some  sort  of  mental \n23  health  group  without  any  recognition  of  her  specific  needs  and \na  24  without  any  recognition,  and  this  was  shocking  to  me,  of  the \n25  multiple  hospitalizations,  the  failure  of  treatment  plan  and \n\n(,-\n99 \n1  to  generically  speak  of  her  as  needing  referral  to  out-patient \n2  mental  health  treatment,  I  think  once  again  would  doom  her  to \n3  failure  and  that's  not  minimally  adequate. \n4  Q  Was  there  anything  else  in  the  not  minimally \n5  adequate  part  of  your  report? \n6  A  Without  being  redundant,  I  think  that  covers  a  lot \n7  of  ground. \n8  Q  All  right.  Now,  let  me  back  up  on  the  diagnosis \n9  part.  In  your  opinion  is  the  diagnosis  that  Dr.  Patel  gave \n10  her,  was  that  less  than  a  minimally  adequate  diagnosis? \n1 1  A  In  two  ways.  First,  again,  and  this  is  the  less \n12  severe  of  the  two  criticisms.  I  think  it was  wrong  to  label \n13  her  as  having  a  borderline  Rersonality  disorder  for  the \n14  reasons  we  discussed  earlier. \n15  Q  Because  of  the  pejorative  aspect  of  it? \n16  A  Well,  it was  wrong  because  she  has  a  if you  want \n17  to  label  her  as  having  a  personality  disorder,  if  you're  doing \n18  this  for  research  purposes,  she  would  have  a  personality \n19  change  due  to  a  general  medical  condition,  meningitis.  But \n20  that's  not  the  severe  criticism.  The  severe  criticism  is  that \n21  even  if  she  had  a  borderline  personality  disorder  -- if  she \n22  did  have  that,  then  the  treatment  plan  is  pretty  much  all \n23  wrong.  Long  hospitalizations,  frequent  hospitalizations  are \n24  the  wrong  kind  of  treatment  for  somebody  with  a  borderline \n25  personality  disorder  or  with  whatever  you  want  to  call  the \n\n------\n----'----~=====~='L\"__ \n122 \nI \n1  the  way  to  go.  Regional  boards,  if they  had  flexibility  -- if \n2  they  could  use  their  money  the  way  they  wanted  to  use  it  and \n3  werenlt  line  itemed  to  sending  it  over  to  state  hospitals, \n4  they  could  develop  programs  like  that.  It  wouldnlt  cost  any \n5  more.  People  would  be  happier.  Thatls  the  kind  of  vision  that \n6  I  think  was  behind  House  Bill  100. \n7  Q  Okay.  11m  just  about  to  wrap  up  here.  Okay.  I  had \n8  to  ask  this.  This  is  switching  gears  here.  What  is  the  Dow \n9  of  Pooh? \n1 0  A  I  am  delighted  in  your  interest.

A number of additional issues ~ere \n(  used in internal peer reviews. \nHethods of Evaluation: All GRHA charts were reviewed. These inc  ded a 1987 psychological evaluation by Dr.  Lynn Cooper, \nsupervised by Dr. stephen Ziegler.  Elaine's  provided c  ies of psychological and related evaluations done at \n~other \nGracesood shen Elaine sas'placed there as a teenager ;and 0  a current evaluation by Dr.  June KaufBan,  a psychologist in \nprivate practice who ~as extensive experience with ~ental  etardation. Here at GROA,  I administered the Stanford-Binet \nIntelligence Scale,  4th Edition, (1986),. as Hell as port' ns of the WAIS~R. Elaine ~as observed on the unit,  interviewed and \ncounseled on a nUlilber of occasions by this HI'iter and  y Ms.  Gerda Abbey,  a psychology intern. \n'Background Ristory: Elaine is said to have had a  al birth and normal development until around age one,  when she b'as \nhospitalized tiith a fever and symptoms suggestin  a meningitis or encephalitis. Elaine's biological father is said to have \nbeen an abusive alcoholic Nho divorced and lef  the faiily when Elaine was two. She has not seen him since. Elaine's mother \nreports that there tiere increasing and proldi  nt behavior probleES subsequent to these events (in contrast to the behavior \nof the older sister). on reaching school a  , Elaine did poorly in public school and later had to be placed in private \nschool for special education, Hhere she s  11 did not do very ijell. \nDuring puberty, increased behavior  obleliS including belligerence, tantI'UBS,  and sexual !!lisbebavior led to Elaines's \nadrrission to GraceBood state Hospital  age 14, rlhere staff clearly regarded her developRental and behavioral problejgS as \nijorganicY in origin. There are repo  in the old charts that Elaine said she ~as sexually abused at about age 12 by ber \nstepfather, and she still aakes  •  claim if asked about it. I did not find any indication that this abuse lias ever \ncorroborated by Elaine's nother  by any other source.  Because Elaine has frequently been delusional about her sexual and \nsocial experience, I cannot fo  an opinion as to ubether she was actually sexually abused,  but her belief Ray have the \n:force of reality. \nSchool probleiS notwi  ding,  Elaine did develop some ability to read and arite, and verbal expression and \ncOiprehension Bere relati  strengths for ber.  In 1966, at age 14-5, she TYas  given the WIse  (apparently by a private \nexaIriner) and the scores  ere Full Scale IQ 60,  Perfonance IQ 51,  and Verbal IQ 75. AP eabody Picture Vocabulary Test \n/  'liven in 1968 did not  qqest as high a level of verbal functioning:  the Peabody  RIQII  !las only 54 !lith a mental age of \n\\. ~_  .>out 6 years.  In 19  the Peabody was repeated, !:lith an  ilIQu of 57;  and on the Slosson Intelligence Test she had an IQ \nscore of 48 Nitb a  ental age estimate of 7 years 8  months.  The Gracewood evaluators saw her as high in the uoderate range \nof  retarda  on, or perhaps mildly to moderately retarded. \n~ental \nShe l1as at  acewood for 30r 4 years,  making little progress and being unable to hold job assignl'lents for long be\"vause \nPRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL.

(No \ntest result is cited.) She t1as frequently readllltted through the early  '80s, Hhen HOst attending physicians regarded her as \naentally retarded tJith behavior piobl~, but they said she did not have thought disorder or psychosis. She Bas often \ndischarged tiith no liIedicatiOns, and eith little behavioral iElprOVel'!ent,  as far as can be judged froB progress notes. When \nneuroleptics l:1ere used,  it is not clear that they had any effect other than general tranquilization. \nElaine reported being narried for about 3 years in the early 80s, but said that she tias beaten by her husband, causing \na lliscal1:iage.  There is another report that the DOther bad the Barriage annulled after a Duch shorter period. Elaine also \nheld a couple of Eenial jobs for brief tiIieS through this period.  , ; \nElaine's pattern of typical probleM continued until 1987 r lihen she tias adHitted for attacking a liol!e provider and the \nprovider's grandchild with a knife. A psychological evaluation Has requested to confirB or rule out a diagnosis of \npersonality disorder. A WAlS~R !fas 8dBinistered, along tiith a Bender Gestalt and the llouse-'l'ree~Person drawings. The \nresults for the aAIS~R aere Verbal IQ 69,  Perforl9ance IQ 66,  and Full Scale IQ 66.  [Note that the Verbal and Full Scale IQs \nare each a point 10i1er than originally reported because of correction of a scoring error on the Comprehension subtest.l The \nexaminer noted that Elaine had relative strength in a good attention span and fairly good expressive verbal skills, but \nthat she tias ~particularly aeak in social cOHprehension, has a very lo~ fund of general knol:1ledge,  and shoi1S soae evidence \nof organic impairnent.  The Bender dratiings also !fere vieaed as indicating organicity, although they could also be vieeed \nW \nas developEentally bmature. The H~T~P drawings suggest arrested personality developl3ent, especially the hUlilan figure \ndrauing. Dr. Cooper and Dr.- Ziegler diagnosed Organic Personality Syndrone  an Axis I DSM-III oR diagnosis. The attending \nI \nphysician evidently did not concur; Elaine uas discharged t-lith a diagnosis of ,AdjustBent Reaction. \non the next adI!lissioD,  in May/June of 1988, Dr.  Thaliath tried Elaine on Trilafon and Tegretol and reported a \nrel!larkable response.  on the subsequent adl!ission, Dr. }J;jin tried Trilafon and Tegretol again. He uas unsure of the results, \nbut progress notes ShOB at least that the patient did inprove. She was diagnosed as scbizoaffective. OVer the next feB \nadBissions there appeared to be an increase in lOIi grade delusional beliefs, as in her stating that people t-Iere putting \nr \n''lings in her food.  Dr.  Thaliath tried Tegretol on tNO different adJilissions tiith less success than previously. On one \n'---A..iJiission she iIaproved, but then soured as discharge approached. Drs.  Patel and Hopkins used a diagnosis of psychotic \ndisorder NOS for the next three adEissions; both also noted borderline personality characteristics. For admissions in 1994 \nand 95, Dr. Patel diagnosed only borderline personality disorder and ~ild Eental retardation. He did not see evidence of \npsychotic SYl'lptO!i!S,  saying that her delusional stateElents and reports of hallucinations tiere either manipulative behavior \nor the result of eeak ego boundaries in a retarded individual. He continued to use neuroleptics at blOst times because of  . \nElaines's agitation and verbal aggression, Bhich ~ere a probleQ on the unit. \nElaine repeatedly refused or Ilbleijll  placeHents and refused to cooperate l1ith the treatBent teal!! on placement issues, so \nat one point the possibility of discharging her to a shelter brought,intervention by her mother and by Protection and \nAdvocacy. As a result, she lias referred to Dr. June Kaufraan for psychological evaluation. Dr.  Kaufman has considerable \nexperience in evaluating developnental disabilities.  Dr.  Kaufaan apparently obtained adequate cooperation and effort from \nElaine, SOBe anxiety and delusional behavior notwithstanding. She obtained ~AIS-R scores of Verbal IQ 66, Perfornance IQ \n56, and Full Scale IQ 58. HOl'1ever,  Dr.  Kaufman noted that the Periornance IQ t?as alYost certainly an overestimate, because \nof Elaine'S failure to perf On! three subtests on the Perfornance Scale.  The WAIS-R gives a scaled score of 1 even Ehen the \nraB score is zero as on these subtests. This placed both the Periornance IQ score and the Full Scale score in question. \nD \nIn addition, Dr.  KaufBan obtained a PPVT-R  (Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised) standard age score of only 44, \ntlith an age score of only 4~10, T:1hich raised SORe doubts about the WAIS-R Verbal IQ.  An age score for a hwaan figure \ndraBing eas only ~ 1/2 to 5 years. Finally, Elaine's adaptive behavior cORposite standard score on the Vineland ~as only \n31, very 1011 for soseone t1ith a history of Wechsler IQs  in the 60s. While Dr.  Kauflilan also reported a TONI~2 (Test of \nNonverbal Intelligence-2) score of 63,  she concluded that in general,  Elaine Has functioning in the upper portion of the \nliloderate range of intellectual functioning.  Dr.  KaufBan recolimended placelllent in a highly structured residential hone \nappropriate for an individual t?ith uental retardation and behavioral/eBotional deficits. \nBehavioral Observations: Elaine is nOt<]  43 years old,  and looks older, Nith short, greying hair. Her gait and voice are a \nlittle odd,  but not clearly suggestive of either Rental illness or uental retardation.  Elaine had been tried on Depakote \n'recently  and tlost staff felt it had reduced her lability and outbursts. She Bas still tending, hOHever,  to keep to \nI \n(  !Self, and tibile she could put on a front of cheerful conversation for a lllinute or teo, evidence of continued depression \n'-would break in. She repeatedly voiced a nUl9ber of delusional theBeS,  never bizarre in quality, but rather indicating  \" \nconflict ililplicit in her needs and the results she fears if she tries to lileet those needs.  She said a male staff person l1as \ntrying to sexually exploit her and other feJjale patients, but then obliquely adnitted her fondness for hili, followed by an \nGRHA.  ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT.

These delusions calle up and !fere \ndealt tiith during the first of three te.sting sessions.

There l:1ere a fef']  instances I:1here she appeared to \nhallucinate also but again tihat she thought sbe heard Has not bizarre, being instead related to her uishes and delusions. \no \n'test Results:  FolloHing are the Standard Age SCores  (SAS)  for the Stanford-Binet cognitive areas, and the overall or \nCOlilposite SAS. These scores are the sme as deviation IQ scores, having an expected Bean of 100. However,  the standard \ndeviation is 16 rather than the usual 15  (as on the wechsler tests) so that, for exalilple,  68 rather ~ 70 is the \nde~arcation line betl:1een borderline and slId mental deficiency. \nVerbal Reaso  '«5  AbstractjVisual  54  Quantitative  62  Short Tam Mell.  43  composite \n}lote that the COlilposite SAS is not an average of the area SAS scores, but represents the extent to Nhich the  of \nSU1il \nthose scores differs frON the sums for the reference' population. \nBeloo are the Standard Age Scores for the individual subtests.

When an area SAS is derived \nfroIiJ only one subtest, the effect in retarded subjects is to obtain a somewhat higher score than is likely to result tihen \nnore subtests are given.  I liould have liked to give more subtests, but it lias clear that Elaine's reasoning poHers were  . \noccluded by ller depression and delusional thinking, and there is no merit in piling up iore subtest results if the subject \ncannot perfom at her best. While liEited, the results are consistent tIith the hypothesis that Elaine is functioning at \npresent in the upper portion of the moderate range of intellectual deficiency. \nThe score for Visual Absurdities was not included in calculating the overall scores,  in part because this subtest is \nusually not given to adults, but also because Elaine's lilental disorder seemed to be interfering with this task much gore \ntban it .bad flith other tasks. For exalilple,  she did not see anything arong with a picture of a bicycle Nith square Bheels. \nConfronted Hith a picture of a blindfolded ian holding a newspaper as if to read it, she at first said just, IIblind.11 \nPressed for l'1hat she ~eant, she said,  AI could go blind.

This illustrates the magnitude which Elaine'S nental disorder can have \non her cognitive functioning. \nWhile not always reflected in the test results, there is a discrepancy betaeen Elaine's surface verbal facility and her \nBarked geakness in both verbal and nonverbal reasoning.  Several eXaBiners have cOlilliented that she talks as if sbe is lllucb \nS1iarter than she is. I bave seen this pattern in sone other lilental retardateso  It seens to occur Bore often in patients \ntiho, like Elaine, contracted Reningitis/encephalitis early in lifeo I do not believe that there is a verbal/nonverbal \ndiscrepancy in Elaine's case, but that initial ililpressions, and certain tests such as the Wechsler verbal subtests, tend to \nDverestiHate her verbal ability. This bas led Bany to expect too nuch of Elaine. \n( ___  ;iscuSsion: Four issues !;lere advanced in a recent peer review of Elaine Wilson's situation. These are related in part to \nallegations J.i.lade by Protection and Advocacy,  and in part to responses frOH consulting staff at DLC.  'l'hey are as follo~s. \n10  P&A expresses concern that Elaine's condition has deteriorated over the years because she bas not been \nyeceiving ainiEally adequate services at the hospital. \nGRHA  ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT.  DO NOT CHART.  PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL.  ELAINE WILSON.  PAGE  3 \n\n2.0 P&A suggests that this is not the. least restrictive environl!lent available to Elaine, and that SOl!le sort \nof supervised comsunity placeBent Bay be available. \n30 There is a question as to Hhether Elaine's habilitation needs have been addressed. \n~o A question eas raised as to eOOther He have an accurate diagnosis. \nTaking the last question first, it. is quite clear that Elaine is nentally retarded, has a longstanding personality \ndisorder with  borderline features, and also has a fairly lODg history of non-bizarre delusions and hallucinations ehich \nserve Bainly to express her hopes and fears. These are not just daydreans, but are accollpanied at tiI!les by very clear \nevidence of perceptual distortion and disordered thinking.  (See exaHples in this evaluation.) \nOne possibility eould be to diagnose Borderline Personality Disorder on Axis II, along eith Bental retardation, but to \ndiagnose SChlzoaffective Disorder, Depressed Type on Axis 1. tlhen patients eith Borderline Personality ,slip over into \npsychosis, they often present as schizoaffective. Because borderline personality dynaEics eere present> in Elaines's \nchildhood, diagnoses of both Borderline PD and scbhoaffective disorder are pernissible. BOHever,  there is a proble!! in \ndiagnosing schizoaffective disorder in a patient Hhere there is an Axis III organic etiology, namely encephalitis. \nAn alternative, ehich I  prefer, is to diagnose organic personality SyndroTile.  There is a clear organic etiology, the \nsage encephalitis shich produced Elaine's nental retardation. This diagnosis also pernits SOBe degree of delusions and \nhallucinosis, as well as encollipassing disordered flood,  affect, and ilJpulsivity such as ee see in Elaine.  It is not unusual \nin cases of Organic Personality Syndroie to see proninent borderline personality disorder dyna~ics. The only probleB tlith \nthis course of action is that Organic Personality Syndrone is in DSM-III -R, but not in DSM-IV.  For DSM-IV the diagnosis \neould be,  Change  to and Axis III Condition,R naaely, status post encephalitis  nental retardation. One \n~Personality  ~  ~ith \naould then need separate diagnoses of hallucinosis and delusional disorder due to an Axis III condition. \nI  cannot agree uith the idea that Elaine nerely has behavior probleiS related to personality disorder and Bental \nretardation. There is no precedent in either Bental retardation or in the study of personality disorders to \nenco~pass \nElaine's degree of psychosis under these diagnostic UBbrellas.  It is true that Elaine has in the past made suicidal \ngestures Bith the expressed intent of getting into the hospital.  It ~ay be true that S02e of her current delusional and \nhallucinatory behavior is for attention seeking. But close observation indicates that ~ost of this is not Racting up,lI it \nlIacting outi of inner eisbes and conflicts. Thus it is not consistently affected by  others attend to or ignore \nC~  ~hether \nJ.aine/s behavior. \nYbe next question concerns Hhether Elaine's condition has deteriorated, and in Hhat ~ay. The  IQ scores have not changed \nthat l1uch.  In the table beloe are shorm test scores obtained betBeen 1966 and the present. \nSettinq!

The siRi1ar drop in PPVT-R scores is in part due to \nrestandardization. The Slosson IQ of 48 and the Stanford-Binet SAS of 44  are not significantly different. The discrepancy \n.- ~tt<1een the mSCjWAIS-R and the other RIQB  scores is also explainable: Wechsler tests are notorious at this hospital for \n'\"  arestimating the IQ of mentally deficient patients.

Tbe decreIient in the Perfomance subtests is significant but is hard to interpret because \ng \nDr. Kauflilan pointed out Elaine essentially did not attel1pt three subtests, Picture COlipletion, Block DesilJi, and Digit \n\\...  oS  g \nS}1IiIbol,  on !:1hich she had perforoed at a mildly deficient level in 1987. On the remaining Perfornance subtests her \nu \nperforJilance did not change at all on Picture arrangelient (where she passed only the first iteli! on the 2nd try on both \noccasions), while there eas a drop by about half in her rafJ score on Object AsseJably  (14 to about 7). Clearly lller failure \nto rgake a Eleaningful attelipt at three SUbtests in 1995 leaves the PenOrRance subtests l!eaningless as a Iileasure of possible \ndetJentia. \nFor the Verbal subtests, the scaled and raw scores for Infomtion and Vocabulary tiere unchanged over the 3 year \ninterval. The scaled scores for Digit Span and Col!lprehension dropped by  just one point, and the scaled score for \nshularities rose a point. The only significant drop was in the Aritlmetic subtest, ehere both the rae and SCGlled score \ndropped froH .5 to 2.  . \nt \n.The WAIS=R subtests Infornation, Vocabulary and COlilprehension were repeated as part of this evaluation by the present \nexaEiner in order to look for qualitative changes froH the 1987 evaluation.  Elaine passed only three Inforuation items, \ng \nthe sane ones she passed in 1987. She failed 2 Vocabulary items for !ihich sbe had received full or partial credit in 1987. \nIn one case the failure see~ed' to be RpsychodynaBic,o uben she replied to repair by saying, °To repair so~etbin' in your \nlife that's not reality.c She ~ould not give a scorable elaboration. on CORprehension she failed 5 ite~ for ebich she had \ngotten some credit in 1987.  In two cases she appeared to be rejecting the question. Her remaining answers uere sOie~bat \nloose and tangential. The drop in Coaprehension score appears due to lower iotivation and to exacerbated iental illness, \nnot to any clear deaenting process. \nIn the early 19905, Elaine's Bother becane increasingly concerned that Elaine Bas worsening.  She perceived the probleR \nnot. as dexaentia, but as markedly increased cparanoia.  It got so that the mother could not take Elaine hOl!le for a ueekend \ng \npass ~ithout Elaine becotling quite delusional over police surrounding the apament, or siRilar concerns. with the \nincreased delusions CaRe longer periods of agitation, ~ith verbal and sORetiues physical aggression.  The mother also noted \nthat Elaine Has discouraged and depressed Dore of the tiae. \nIn revieNing all available records going back to her early teens, it appears that Elaine has always had so~e delusions \nand SOBe hallucinatory behavior, and has alHays had periods of loud agitation, uith verbaJ and sometiies physical  . \n19Iessi~n. She bas. always bad periods of depression, uith reclusive behavior and occasional suicidal gestures. In between \n( \ndlese behaviors, she has often been,  Ii ••• 1iIostly easy going and pleasant when she is busy and ~ith people, and things are \ngoing pretty Fluch her Otffl Hay. II She still bas patches of good behavior, but they don't last long.  The change has been one \nof proportion rather than of nature: formerly the RgoodR behaviors predOlllinated,  where today the \"badR behaviors occupy \nmuch ~ore of her uaking hours.  Lesley Slone, who has worked at the hopital for over 14 years and Norked with Elaine in \n1981 is strongly of :t he opinion that Elaine eas doing Buch better then than she is noo. \nv \nWhy  has this change occurred? One can bla~e BinstitutionalizationQ to SOie extent. One can hypothesize age-related \noorsening of Elaine's lifelong 'disorder of HOod,  affect, and impulse. one can note that Elaine's life has gone very badly \nI \nand that she has uorn out her already very li~ited coping skills and resources trying to solve her problems. Quite possibly \nthese factors are all operating together in a destructive synergy. \nWhile I  believe Elaine'S deterioration is related to Rfunctional\" causes, environaental, psychodynamic,  and depressive \nin natureo her loss of Height and her beHel and bladder incontinence liIust be viewed tvith concern. They nay be due in large \n~ tD ,depression and regression, but she ~ust be ~atched for signs of eNS Balfunction contributing to these probleHS. \nThere have also been SOtle balance proble~, but these appear to have been due to trials of Iiledications such as Tegretol \nl::1hich can cause ataxia. \nI  think that the hospital services provided to Elaine have been  RminiBally adequate,R in that they have uorked to an \nacceptable degree vith other Rdual diagnosisR patients eho are both aentally ill and ilentally retarded.  Elaine bas \ngenerally been stabilized in the past, and was returned to environments which !:Jere adequately safe, and in !ihich her basic \nneeds Bere provided. I think that ~t bas been lacking has been not so much special habilitation services for uental \nretardation, but rather the lack of adequate bolding and groHth enviroIlBents for her borderline personality condition. Wbat \nservices Bight have nade a difference? \nIt has been suggested that Elaine and her mother need therapy to eork on their relationship, and even that Elaine \nshould Hove back l:Jith her mother in order to alleviate her abandonnent depression.  Elaine's nother,  who  in Ey viea haS·Buch \nmore COmlon sense and cOlilpassion than she bas been given creft for, bas quite properly objected to taking Elaine back, \npointing 'out that Elaine cannot even get through a eeekend pass uithout decoBlpensating.  The !Jotber notes that mental health \n\"'rofessionals have been telling ber for three decades to separate frOB Elaine, and that reversing course makes no sense. As \n! \n!',,_  JX  Ilrelationship therapy,tI I do not see hoe it applies.  I have tlatcbed the~ during visits, and the !!Iother relates \nappropriately.  Elaine often relates appropriately as ffell.  If tlhat is ueant is the Runderlying relationshipR  (whatever,that \nis)g does one eEbark on serious relationship therapy for a low functioning patient with borderline personality and \nfluctuating psychosis? I 110uld not tiear the raother out on this doubtful enterprise. The probletil is not to help Elaine \nGRHA  ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT.  DO HOT CHART.  PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL.  ELAINE WILSON.  PAGE  5 \n\n~~late to ~d live with her Bother. The proble~ is to help Elaine stop living in the turBoil of her· eants and fears,  to \nl \n,cept her present situation as a starting point, to nake use of her pleasanter personality traits, and to learn to live in \n-the coIDilunity  enjoying life as Duch as she can. \nI \nThe possibility of social skills training has been raised. Actually, Elaine has fairly good social skills, I!hen she \n~akes use of theg. I  have been very impressed at hotl she can politely and graciously stop me in the hall and raise concerns \nabout her situation Hithout any initial agitation.  (That comes later.) It is not her social Bethods and tactics li'bich are \nat issue, but her strategy and goals. I  eould not spend ti~e on social skills unless she is used in a group Hhere she ~ight \nqat SORe satisfaction by deI§onstrating social skills for other patients. One area I  night cite as an exception l:lould be \nhelping Elaine to find better Hays of expressing dissatisfaction than shouting racial epithets at staff and patients. She \nneeds t? learn constr~~tive coBplaining. \nIt has been suggested that tie set up a behavior nodification prograB for Elaine,  including rel:lards ,for appropriate \nbehavior and for refraining frOB  inappapropriate behavior; and perhaps deduction of tokens or delay of· special privileges \nfor Barkedly inappapropriate behavior.  I do not anticipate nore than liEited success tdth this approach. Because of her \ndepression, Elaine has reduced interest in tangible or social rel1ards. She is likely to perceive the structure of a \nbehavior ~ification prograrn as just another imposition on her Bisery. She Bight, hoeever,  be reinforced by periods of \nquality time and conversation Hith staff, provided that deprivation of such tine is seen as a natural and logical \nconsequence for closely related inappropriate behavior, and not as a penalty for such things as getting out of bed late or  .-\nreluctance to bathe. \nThe qeneral outlines of a treatBent and placeient program are perhaps seen in Extended state Hospital Treatient of \nSeverely Iipaired Borderline Patients by Drug and Lavigne  (Hospital and COiEunity Psychiatry, vol.38, pp 515-519, 1987). \nThey discuss the establish~ent of an adequate holding environment in the hospital, the maintenance of that environBent to \nfoster linited changes in the patlent, and the transfer of the holding enviroDlilent frolil the hospital to the community.  It \nappears that  bave bean trying to do Hhat they suggest in our history of manageBent with Elaine. Often the hospital has \n~e \nfunctioned  for Elaine as a basic holding environHent,  but we have been less successful in fostering change,  and Be \n~ell \nhave had great difficulty finding community placenents Ehere the necessary extension of the holding environment can be  -' \nrealized • \n.~    Elaine has beco~ so worn out in this environnent that she would benefit frOB  a complete change of scene to help her \n~~iub out of ber depression and take renewed interest in life. Our hospital was never intended for long-term habilitation \n(except DLC which serves lower functioning retardates), and our relatively spartan physical and social environBent is \nintended to inspire patients to return quickly to life outside.  It is unavoidably lacking as a long-tern growth \nenvironlaent. Elaine Bay need a neB and llore giving environElent. Perhaps this could be found eventually in a structured \ncommunity residential prograe for relatively high level Rentally retarded patients, a prograE able to deal Bith serious \nbehavioral and emotional probleBS.  If Elaine is not ready for such a CORBunity placement, then she ~ight do better in an \nupper level rehabilitation proqrai at one of the state mental retardation hospitals. \nWe have discussed the aatters of diagnosis, of habilitation needs,  of uinimally adequate services and of the least \nrestrictve environ~ental options. The' peer review also included a nURber of recoNBendations concerning assessuent, \ntreatsent, and placenent.  I hope it is clear that Hore assessment is not a priority; ~e have ~orkable diagnoses and can \nspecify relevant treatHent options. Brook Run should be asked to assess this patient only if the purpose is to detmine \nBhether she enters the state MR systeI!l. While an outside 1m consultant's assistance would be Helcol!e,  it is not strictly \nnecessary, because both the current behavior specialist on Treatl4ent Unit and her supervisor (M) have training and \nexperience in the area of Flental retardation. \nIt was reco~nded that Elaine'S psychiatric condition be better stabilized. It is unfortunate that neuroleptics have \nnot been Bore helpful with her delusional and hallucinatory behavior.  We  Bight viee these behaviors as psychotic features \naccompanying depression.  If this is true, then relief of depression may reduce psychotic synpto§s. As for her disruptive \nbehavior, Depakote was tried recently, and say have left her less labile and agitated. She has received only a brief and \ninconclusive trial ~ith an SSRI, so Zoloft or a similar Hedication could be tried for relief of depression. SSRIs sOlsetioes \ncontribute to reduced lability in borderline patients. \nI have noted already that behavior sodification and social skills training Bay have li~ited proBise. A recolBendation \nto establish a Foster Grandparent or siBilar relationship to alloB daily interaction with a trusted person is BOrth trying, \nbut l!Iay hold hazards for a patient with borderline personality dynaBics.  It ~ill be necessary for all the staff to attempt \n~ Rore actively friendly and nurturing relationship ~ith Elaine. She needs to be coaxed into Dore pleasant activites. When \n--___  ~ is delusional, staff should avoid reinforcing this behavior with too ~uch attention, but it has been useful to gently \ncounsel with Elaine to correct her delusional ideas and to help her clarify her feelings.  If she escalates into a tirade, \nshe sho~d be ignored as llluch as possible, or quietly and matter-of~factly inferned if natural or logical consequences Bust \nbe apphed because of the needs of the situation. If she is being reclusive and negative, she should not be chided or  -\nGRHA  !TTORNEY WORK PRODUCT. ,DO NOT CHART.  PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL.  ELAINE WILSON.

When she is in a relatively good ~ood, staff can again offer options for pleasant activities. staff should not \n, ~ait to offer diversions and options until Elaine behaves badly. This can have the effect of reinforcing inappropriate \nberhaviorso \nIf it were administratively possible, He iight Bove Elaine frog Treatment unit to a te§porary GapartmentR in a spare \nIoon on DLC.

She Hould continue to receive \nindividual counseling and relevant group experiences through Treat!leI1t Unit.  Later she could bus off caipus to attend \nrelevant day proqrans.  I eouId not recoBEend any of these steps ~ithout first explaining to Elaine ahat was  intended and \ngetting her consent, as eell as indicating ehat must happen if the placeoont fails.  I gould also hesitate to take such \nsteps unless SORe very strong options for eventual outside placement had been identified and researched. While I an anxious \nto see Elaine in any envirol1l'!ent {ihich Horks better for her, I do not t:1ant an intra hospital transfer which Bight not lead \nanY\\1here. \nSUiEaxy and Recommendations:  Elaine wilson is a mentally retarded patient Nith borderline personality structure and Nith \nmood,  hallucinatory, and delusional  consistent with Schizoaffective Disorder, Depressed Type.  Her disorder can \nSYRpto~ \nalso .be regarded as Organic Personality SyndrOMe {:lith borderline personality traits and depression.  Elaine/s speech \nmisleads others into thinking that she is no  than borderline IQ or 13ildly retarded, but she is in the upper portion \nliOrse \nof the moderately retarded range on the more appropriate tests. There does not appear to be clear evidence of organic \ndeterioration, but depression and related delusional and hallucinatory syaptoms are interfering Hith cognitive function. \nShe should be watched, hOHever,  for any indication of a structural organic condition contributing to her current \ndifficulties.  , \nElaine's behavioral problems appear nainly related to her borderline personality structure and to ber depression, and \nnot to insufficient habilitation  respect to her aental retardation.  If Elaine could act through the  day as she \n~ith  ~hole \ndoes at her best, her deficiencies in social and ADL skills Hould be of little consequence.  Therefore alleviation of her \nroblems ~ill come not through the mechanical provision of behavior modification and skills training, but through \n( \n~leviation of depression and through provision of a Bore pleasant and giving environment in ~hich she can be helped to \nrelate to others in a less regressive manner. \n!  minimUE goal Hould be to achieve some relief of depression through pharmacology,  and to improvise a more caring and \ngiving environment on TreatBent unit. Placing her in a new environEent, however, aight provide the contrast needed to help \nher break her current- patterns; She Hill probably require a closed, inpatient environment in the near tera, but there is  . \nS02e consensus that she could eventUally achieve cOiNunity  I Bould favor placement in a professionally \nplace~ent. \nsuperviSed group ho~e for higher level patients Nith uental deficiency and ~ental illness. \nGary DeBacher Ph.D., licensed clinical psychologist \n-~ \n--\nGRHA  ATTORNEY  WORK PRODUCT.

With respect to prepaid capitated health plans, 42 CPR 434.23 \nrequires a State to specify its capitation methodology and the actuarial \nbasis for computation of the capitation fees and to document 1l:bat the \ncapitation fees and other payments do not exceed the upper limits set \nforth in 42 CPR 447.361. \nIn fully capitated programs, i.e., those where all waiver services are \ncapitated, calculation of the upper payment limit will constitute a \nState's projections of costs in the absence of the waiver.  In programs \nwhere only some services are capitated, or where there are oilier \nreimbursement arrangements, additional calculations will be necessary. \nOnce an upper limit is determined and any other calculations are made \nwhich are necessary to compute the costs in the absence of the waiver, \nthen the costs under the waiver must be determined.  This is computed \n'I,,:: \n\\it) \nby projecting the total capitation fees to be paid along with any other \ncosts such as bonuses, FlFS costs for waiver services, or additional \nadministrative costs (if any).  The following methodology provides a \n. fonnat for verifying compliance with applicable federal regulations \nregarding upper payment limits, capitation ratesetting, and cost \neffectiveness for capitated section 1915(b) waiver programs. \nPlease refer to Appendix C.2/C.3 for an explanation of the waiver cost \nestimates. \n1.

Therefore, this Court has jurisdiction over this case\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\nx\n\nSTATEMENT OF THE ISSUES\n(I) Whether the district court was correct in finding that\nunnecessary segregation is a form of discrimination under the\nAmericans With Disabilities Act (ADA).\n(2) Whether the district court was correct in finding that\nthe defendants violated the ADA when they forced two individuals\nwith disabilities to receive disability services in an institution\nwhen those two individuals qualified for the same services in an\nexisting community-based program.\n(3) Whether the Attorney General's interpretation of the ADA\nand her own implementing regulation, which requires that services\nbe provided in the most integrated setting appropriate to\nplaintiffs' needs, is entitled to deference.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nI. COURSE OF PROCEEDINGS AND DISPOSITION BELOW\nOn May 11, 1995, L.C. filed this action seeking placement in\nthe most integrated setting appropriate to her needs as required by\nthe ADA and its implementing regulations. RI-I-1. At the time\nthat the case was filed, L.C. was confined at Georgia Regional\nHospital at Atlanta (GRH-A), a psychiatric hospital where persons\nwith mental disabilities are segregated from the rest of society.\nBecause L.C.'s treatment staff had concluded for over two years\nthat the most integrated setting appropriate to L.C.'s needs was\nplacement in the community, L.C. sought such a placement. L.C. did\nnot assert a statutory or constitutional per se right to\ndeinstitutionalization. She sought disability services in the\nbroader community of disabled and nondisabled persons because the\nqualified professionals had determined that such a placement was\n\nappropriate based upon the facts of her individual case. I\nEight days after filing her case, defendants placed L.C. at\nher mother's home on a \"trial basis\" with the intent of fully\ndischarging her. Defendants did so without training the mother for\nL.C.'s care and needs, without supportive services in place, and\nwith full knowledge that such placements had failed in the past.\nConsequently, on May 30, 1995, L.C. filed a motion for a\ntemporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. RI-5-1.\nA consent decree resolved L.C.'s motion. Defendants agreed not to\ndischarge L.C., to provide notice of any future proposed discharge,\nand to provide L.C. with all documents related to the development\nof integrated services for her in the community. RI-6-1.\nOn July 27, 1995, L.C. filed a second motion for a temporary\nrestraining order and preliminary injunction seeking essentially\nthe same relief sought in the first motion because, once again,\ndefendants planned to discharge L.C. to her mother without\nappropriate assessments of L.C.'s needs, without training, and\nwithout appropriate supportive services. R2-17-I. A consent order\nalso resolved that motion. Defendants agreed to perform\nappropriate assessments to determine L.C.'s needs, to withdraw the\nproposed discharge, and to transfer L.C. temporarily to Brook Run,\nan intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded, while\nDefendants developed a plan for integrated services. R2-19-I.\nIn the meantime, on June 16, 1995, E.W. filed a motion and\ncomplaint to intervene as a plaintiff. RI-II-I. In her complaint,\nIL.C. also raised two other claims, but pursued only one of those\nat the summary judgment stage, a Fourteenth Amendment right to\nminimally adequate treatment and freedom from undue restraint.\n2\n\nE.W. asserted the same claims and sought the same relief as L.C.,\ni.e., disability services in an integrated setting, the setting\nthat GRH-A staff had determined was appropriate based upon the\nfacts of her individual case. The district court granted E.W.'s\nmotion on January 29, 1996. (R3-27-I).\nIn July 1996, E.W. moved for a preliminary injunction seeking\nintegrated services in the community in accordance with her needs.\nR4-50-I. In their response, the defendants agreed that E.W. was\ndisabled under the ADA and that she \"may be able to show that she\nwould meet eligibility requirements and be qualified for certain\nservices or programs in the community.\" R5-62-23.\nIn August 1996, plaintiffs and defendants filed motions for\nsummary judgment. At this point, L.C. had been receiving\nintegrated services for over six months. Defendants acknowledged\nin their response to plaintiffs' motion that L.C. was eligible for\nintegrated services in the community. R6-65-3 (defendants' brief).\nDefendants also did not deny that E.W. was eligible for integrated\nservices by stating once again that she \"may be able to show that\nshe is eligible for at least some of the community programs which\nshe seeks.\" I_dd. Defendants then argued that integrated services\nhad been denied due to lack of funding. I__dd.;see also R5-61-18 &\n19 (defendants' brief).\nAlmost six months after the summary judgment motions were\nfiled, defendants submitted additional evidence to the district\ncourt (R7-77-I) regarding E.W.'s kidney ailment that defendants had\nknown about for over two years and that, as noted by the district\ncourt, had been resolved by surgery. R8-80-8. Plaintiffs\nresponded to the additional evidence (R8-79-I), and the district\n\ncourt proceeded to rule on the pending motions.\nIn its order, the district court granted plaintiffs' motion\nand denied defendants' motion for summary judgment on the ADA\nclaim, denied plaintiffs' and defendants' motion on the 14th\nAmendment claim as moot (due to its ADA ruling), and denied\nplaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction as moot. R8-80-13.\nIn granting plaintiffs' ADA claim, the district court held that\n\"unnecessary institutional segregation of the disabled constitutes\ndiscrimination\nper s__e, which cannot be justified by a lack of\nfunding.\" R8-80-8. The district court reasoned that the ADA\nstates that segregation is a form of discrimination that Congress\nintended to eliminate; that the Attorney General's regulations\nimplementing the ADA plainly prohibit unnecessary\ninstitutionalization and require a public entity to make reasonable\nmodifications in its policies, practices, and procedures to avoid\ndiscrimination, unless the modifications would fundamentally alter\nthe nature of the service, program, or activity; and that the case\nof Helen L. v. DiDario, 46 F.3d 325 (3rd Cir. 1995), cert. denied,\n116 S. Ct. 64 (1995) had held to the same effect. R8-80-8 & 10.\nIn so holding, the court found that the qualified experts\nunanimously agreed that plaintiffs could be placed in the community\n(R8-80-7); that defendants conceded that plaintiffs qualified for\ncommunity-based services (id.); that defendants had programs for\nproviding community services to plaintiffs (R8-80-I0); that such\nservices were less costly (id.); and that defendants could not show\nthat their program would be fundamentally altered. R8-80-10, ii.\nAs a remedy for the defendants' violation of the ADA, the\ndistrict court ordered defendants to comply with the ADA by\n\nreleasing E.W. to an appropriate community-based program and by\nproviding L.C. with all appropriate services necessary to maintain\nher current placement in such a program. R8-80-13 & 14.\nDefendants perfected their appeal to this Court (R8-84-I) and\nrequested a stay of the judgment (R8-85-I), which the district\ncourt denied. R9-91-I. The defendants appealed the stay denial,\nand this Court carried the stay motion forward with the merits.\nII.\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\nA. INTRODUCTION\nWhen this case was filed, L.C. and E.W. were confined at GRH-\nA, a state psychiatric hospital. Persons confined at GRH-A are\nseparated from the community and walled off from the mainstream of\nsociety where all of us live, work, and play. The segregated\nenvironment at GRH-A is chaotic and complex. R5-59-SMF-146. 2\nBy comparison, community-based programs are integrated\nservices because they are physically located in the mainstream of\nsociety and provide opportunities for persons with mental\ndisabilities to interact with non-disabled persons in all facets of\nlife. At the present time, L.C. and E.W. are receiving appropriate\n2Document No. 59 of the record contains several documents:\nplaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, brief in support,\nstatement of material facts not in dispute, and exhibits. For ease\nof reference, plaintiffs will hereinafter refer to the statement of\nmaterial facts as \"SMF\" followed by the numbered fact in the\nstatement. In this section, all references to \"SMF\" are references\nto facts that defendants admit.\n\nintegrated services in the community. 3\nB.\nL.C. FACTS\nL.C. is mentally retarded and suffers from either a mood\ndisorder or schizophrenia. SMF 80. She has been confined at GRH-A\napproximately 18 times. SM_F 93. Her recent confinement at GRH-A\nlasted three years from May 1992 until May 1995. SMF 94-95.\nThroughout her three year confinement, no qualified mental\nretardation professionals designed or implemented an individual\nhabilitation plan for L.C. SMF-144.\nEight days after this lawsuit was filed, defendants\nimplemented an unsuccessful \"trial visit\" placement to L.C.'s\nmother (R5-59-Exh. 32), despite a lengthy history of failed\nplacements with the mother due to the mother's mental health\nproblems, alcoholism, violence, and general inability to care for\nL.C. as documented extensively in GRH-A's own records. SMF 82-92,\n108-109. Dr. Amin, L.C.'s recent treating physician, never would\nhave made such a placement while L.C. was in his care. SMF 13.\nAfter the trial visit ended, and after L.C. filed two motions\nfor injunctive relief, she was transferred temporarily to Brook Run\non July 27, 1995, until an appropriate placement could be\n3Because E.W. has been provided integrated services through the\nmental retardation waiver program since July 7, 1997, this fact\ndoes not appear in the record. Plaintiffs believe, however, that\nthey should report this fact to the Court. See Tiverton Bd. v.\nPastore, 469 U.S. 238, 240, 105 S. Ct. 685, 686, 83 L.Ed.2d 618\n(1985). This fact is also relevant to defendants' request for a\nstay of the lower court's order - it shows that no stay is needed.\n\nidentified. R2-19-4; SMF124-125. This was done, even though L.C.\ndid not require institutional care, because defendants would not\noffer her any alternative. SMF 125-126.\nFrom the outset, the material facts regarding L.C. have not\nbeen in dispute. In their answer to plaintiffs' complaint,\ndefendants admitted that L.C. had mental disabilities (RI-7-1 at 4\nii); that L.C. had been hospitalized at GRH-A due to her mental\nillness (id. at 4 22); that L.C.'s psychiatric symptoms had been\ncontrolled for over two years (id. at 4 5); that L.C. no longer\nrequired segregated services at GRH-A (id. at 44 i, 5); that L.C.'s\ntreating physician and nurse had indicated as early as 1993 that\nL.C. was \"stable awaiting placement, .... has reached maximum level of\nfunctioning,\" and \"placement is primary problem,\" (i_dd. at 4 30);\nthat defendants were aware of L.C.'s need for integrated services\nin the community (id. at 4 46); and that GRH-A staff had searched\nfor a community placement. Idd. at 4 32; see also SMF 152.\nIn their response to plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment,\ndefendants admitted that L.C. was disabled under the ADA. R5-65-3.\nDefendants also admitted once again that L.C. was eligible for\nintegrated services in the community. I_dd.; see also SMF 81.\nOn February 12, 1996, defendants provided L.C. with integrated\nservices in the community and placed her with Nyasha Hands, a\ncommunity service provider. SMF 134. L.C. now lives with two\nother mentally disabled individuals in a four bedroom ranch house\nwith a large yard that is close to parks, schools, churches,\nshopping, and other amenities. By August, 1996, however, funding\nproblems arose, and L.C. was not receiving appropriate integrated\nservices. R5-59-Exhs. 47, 48. The funding problems were\n\neventually resolved, and, 1 1/2 years later, L.C. continues to live\nhappily and successfully in the mainstream of society.\nC.\nE.W. FACTS\nE.W. suffers from mild mental retardation and a personality\nchange due to meningitis. Elliott I dep., pp. 37-39. The\nmeningitis damaged her brain as an infant. She has a chronic\nkidney problem that, according to her treating physician, has been\nresolved by surgery. 4 R8-79-Exh. 1 at 4 i0. She has been confined\nto GRH-A over 30 times in the past 20 years. SMF 4.\nE.W.'s most recent confinement at GRH-A began on December 20,\n1994. S SMF 7. Her confinement ended on July 7, 1997 when she was\nreleased to the same community-based provider as L.C. with a\n4According to E.W's treating physician, Dr. Futral, and plaintiffs'\nexpert, Dr. Elliott, E.W's kidney problem does not require\ninstitutional care and does not prevent her from living in the\ncommunity. R8-79-Exh. 1 at 44 14-15 and Exh. 2 at 44 7-10. Dr.\nEchols, defendants' pediatric doctor who has never treated E.W.,\nfiled an affidavit six months after summary judgment motions were\nfiled which concluded that E.W.'s \"future needs and an appropriate\nplacement cannot be determined at this time.\" R7-77-Echols' Exh.\nat 4 18. Subsequent to his affidavit, E.W. had successful surgery\nand was placed in the community.\nSAlthough Defendants make some ado regarding E.W.'s symptoms that\nled to this confinement, her symptoms were caused by the side\neffects of her new medication, tegretol. Parrish dep., p. 55, i.\n17-18; p. 56, i. 4-9; and exh. 6 attached to deposition.\n\nsimilar set of integrated services.\nIn their answer to E.W.'s complaint, defendants admitted that\nE.W. had been confined at GRH-Abecause of her disabilities (R3-29-\n1 at ¶ 18); that defendants had a program to provide disability\nseZvices for mentally retarded persons in an integrated setting\n(id. at ¶ 25); and that generally the cost of community services is\nless expensive than institutional care, although the cost can vary\ndepending upon the individual's needs. I_dd.\nSoon after E.W. was segregated at GRH-A until her recent\nrelease into the community, all of the qualified professionals felt\nthat E.W. was appropriate for integrated services in the community.\nAs will be shown below, this fact is evidenced by the\nprofessionals' stated opinions and by their actions in seeking and\nobtaining the provision of integrated services.\nStarting nine days after her confinement at GRH-A, several\nattempts were made to place E.W. in personal care homes. Parrish\ndep., p. 64, i. 3-7; p. 69, I. 7-19; p. 75, i. 1-13. Personal care\nhomes provide little more than room and board for persons with very\nlimited income. Defendants' own staff admit that these homes do\nnot provide the appropriate level of trained supervision and\nsupport that E.W. needs. DeBacher dep., p. 22, i. 19-25; Parrish\ndep., p. 35, i. 3-5; p. 66, i. 3-5 and ii-16; p. 78, I. 13-23; p.\n79, i. 2-5. Mr. Parrish, E.W.'s caseworker from October 1994 to\nAugust 1995, felt that personal care home placements would result\nin rehospitalizations. SMF64. He admitted that E.W. had not been\nplaced in appropriate programs with proper supportive services that\nwould break the cycle of rehospitalizations, including the Stewart\nAvenue home where the provider \"tried to pray the demons out of\n\nher.\" Parrish dep., p. 65, i. 9-13; p. 69, i. 7-19; p. 75, i. 1-\n13; p. 78, i. 3-23; SMF 64.\nE.W.'s treatment team did not place her in structured\nprograms, such as the mental retardation waiver program, because\nthey knew nothing about that program (used for funding integrated\nservices), knew nothing at all about integrated services for\npersons with mental retardation, had never seen a community mental\nretardation placement, or believed that the waiver program was not\nan available option for patients at the treatment unit of GRH-A.\nSMF 42, 63, 66, 68-71, & 73, representing admissions by Dr. Patel,\nDr. Amin, Mr. Parrish, Ms. Ligon, Mr. Bliss, and Ms. Thornton;\nParrish dep., p. 77, i. 20-25; p. 78, i. 1-25; p. 79, i. 2-5; p.\n83, i. 8-24; p. 84, i. 8-16.\nMr. Parrish admitted that E.W.'s placement problem was related\nto her mental\nretardation, yet no mental retardation program was\nconsidered for E.W. In fact, when Mr. Parrish was assigned the\ntask of seeking mental retardation services for E.W., he did\nnothing. I_dd. at p. 79, i. 11-14.\nAlthough E.W.'s placements lacked appropriate supportive\nservices, they demonstrate that GRH-A staff believed that she\nqualified for integrated services. After the placements ended, Dr.\nPatel still believed that E.W. did not meet the criteria for\ninvoluntary confinement at GRH-A and that she qualified for\nintegrated services in the community. See, e.q., Patel ii dep., p.\n20, i. 18-20; p. 25, I. 16-22; p. 75, i. 15-21.\nRather than search for providers who could supply appropriate\nintegrated services, in March 1995, defendants sought to discharge\nE.W. to a homeless shelter. Patel II dep., p. 20, i. 25; p. 21, i.\nI0\n\n1-3; Parrish dep., p. 94, i. 9-12.\nThe discharge to a homeless shelter included no provision for\nmental health services, mental retardation services, or medical\nservices for E.W.'s urinary incontinence. GRH-A staff later\nadmitted that such a placement was inappropriate and would probably\nresult in rehospitalization. Parrish dep., p. 96, i. ii - p. 97,\nI. 3; Steed dep., p. 93, I. 8-11; Bliss dep., p. 86, i. 5-9; see\nalso Elliott I dep., p. 97, i. 25 - p. 99, i. 3; DeBacher dep., p.\n24, i. 17 - p. 25, i. 6. The placement in a homeless shelter was\navoided when present counsel for E.W. objected. SMF 22.\nAfter the ill-advised attempt to discharge E.W. to a homeless\nshelter was stopped, GRH-A staff met in April 1995 and directed Mr.\nParrish to explore other placement options that would include\nmental retardation services. From April 1995 to September 1995,\nhowever, Mr. Parrish made no such efforts. Parrish dep., p. 106,\ni. 12-14; p. 109, i. 20. Ms. Ligon, who replaced Mr. Parrish as\nE.W.'s caseworker in September 1995, similarly did nothing for\nmonths, failing to even speak with the appropriate person, Gloria\nSheppard, of the defendant Fulton County Regional Board, until\nFebruary 1996. Ligon dep., p. 10, i. 2-6; p. 28, i. 17-25; p. 29,\ni. 1-2; Sheppard dep., p. 29, i. 12-18.\nAfter Ms. Ligon's contact with Ms. Sheppard in February, 1996,\nGRH-A's records indicated that in April 1996, E.W. was considered\nfor a community placement with Gloria Brown and Jean Flynn, a\npersonal care home provider. Bliss dep., p. 26, i. 1-3; p. 27, i.\n16-19. According to GRH-A records, Ms. Sheppard repeatedly advised\nGRH-A staff on May 17, 1996, June 10, 1996, and July 17, 1996 that\nE.W. was on a waiting list for integrated services through the\nII\n\nmedicaid waiver program, but that no openings were available. R6-\n70-Exh. i. Those same records indicated that as of August i, 1996,\nE.W. was on two waiting lists for integrated services under the\nmedicaid waiver and the United Cerebral Palsy programs. 6 I_dd.\n\" All of the above efforts at providing E.W. integrated services\nwere done at the direction of E.W.'s treatment staff. Dr. Patel,\nE.W.'s treating physician, repeatedly stated that E.W. qualified\nfor services in the community. A good example is as follows:\nQ: If you were aware of a provider who could meet her needs\nin the community, would you be in favor of placing her in\nthe community?\nA: Yes, why not?\nPatel II dep., p. 76, i. 25 - p. 77, i. 1-4; see also id. at p. 25,\ni. 16-22; p. 33, i. 1-5; p. 75, i. 9-21. Defendants have admitted\nin their previous briefs that Dr. Patel believes that E.W.\nqualifies for integrated services. R5-62-4.\nSimilarly, Dr. DeBacher, a GRH-A psychologist, testified on\nMarch 12, 1996 that E.W. qualified for services in the community\nwhen he first evaluated her in July 1995. DeBacher dep., p. 46, i.\n6 - p. 47, I. 7; see also p. 27, I. 11-16. Said Dr. DeBacher:\n6Although Ms. Sheppard had some reservations about E.W.'s\neligibility for integrated services in April 1996 due to a recent\nbehavioral incident, she clearly indicated in her deposition that\nthis was a temporary concern. Sheppard dep., p. 44, i. 9-18. Her\nconcern was resolved shortly thereafter as evidenced by her active\nattempts to obtain a community placement for E.W., in which she\ncited lack of openings as the only barrier to integrated services,\nand by her assistance in obtaining E.W.'s current community\nplacement.\n12\n\nQ: If you had a home provider who said they would be\nwilling to take her, do you think it would be a\ngood idea to give her a try in the community?\nA: You mean a staff group home or just an individual\nprovider?\nQ: A staffed group home that can provide the things\n' you indicated a group home should do.\nA: Sure, yeah.\nQ: At what point do you think it would have been good\nto try?\nA: Well, as soon as we would have known about\nsuch a place and had about a month to prepare\nto, you know, based on her current situation\nand let her see the place; let them get to\nknow her; talk about contingencies; trial\nvisit there for awhile; you know, give her\nsome encouragement for doing okay.\nI_dd. at p. 46, 1. 6-23. _\n7Defendants cite one phrase out of context from a lengthy report\nprepared by Dr. DeBacher in October, 1995 for the proposition that\nE.W. did not qualify for integrated services. The report as a\nwhole was clear, however, that except for relief of depression\nthrough a medication assessment, Dr. DeBacher did not believe E.W.\nrequired segregated services. He concluded his report as follows:\n\"I would favor placement in a professionally supervised group home\nfor higher level patients with mental deficiency and mental\nillness.\" R5-59-Exh. 6 at p. 7; see also id. at p. 6, ¶ 4\nindicating that E.W. \"has become so worn out in this environment\n[at GRH-A] that she would benefit _rom a complete change of scene\nto help her climb out of her depression and take a renewed interest\nin life.\" Dr. DeBacher's entire report and deposition taken after\nhis report make clear that he believed E.W. qualified for community\nservices from July 1995 to August 1996 when summary judgment\n13\n\no\nJoseph Steed, a member of the Fulton County Regional Board's\ncommunity evaluation team, testified that E.W. could be served in\nthe community (including a group home), listed specific services\nsuch a placement would require, and noted that persons in the\nmedicaid waiver program sometimes obtained such placements. 8 Steed\ndep., p. 61, i. 7-19; p. 62, i. 12; p. 65, i. 19-22; p. 66, i. 1-5.\nFinally, Dr. Richard Elliott, a mental health and mental\nretardation expert retained by plaintiffs in this case, stated that\nE.W. could and should be placed in a more integrated setting in the\ncommunity and that providers existed who could provide E.W. with\nthe necessary integrated services. R5-59-Exh. 1 at ¶¶ Ii, 15 and\nExh. 2 at p. i; Elliott I dep., p. 29, i. 6-10; p. 77, i. 14-24.\nD. AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS AND SERVICES\nIn fiscal year 1995, the latest year for which figures were\navailable at the close of discovery, defendants spent a total\namount of $208,860,127 on integrated community services for persons\nwith mental retardation and mental illness. SMF 180. During that\nsame year, defendants spent a total amount of $212,861,698 on\nsegregated institutional services for persons with mental\nretardation and mental illness. Id. When the state legislature\npassed H.B. 100, O.C.G.A. § 37-2-5.1(c)(3), it allowed defendants\nto transfer monies from state institutions to community placements\nso that more persons could be served in the Community. SMF 170.\nmotions were filed.\n8Although Mr. Steed expressed the same temporary concern expressed\nby Gloria Sheppard in April 1996 regarding integratedservices for\nE.W., his concern was also resolved as evidenced by hisdeposition\ntestimony and E.W.'s actual community placement.\n14\n\nThe medicaid waiver program allows states to spend medicaid\nfunds to provide disability services in the community to mentally\nretarded persons who would otherwise be eligible for segregated\nservices in an intermediate care nursing facility for the mentally\nretarded (ICF-MR). The federal government has authorized matching\nfederal dollars to fund integrated community services for 2,109\npersons in Georgia under the medicaid waiver program, yet in 1996\ndefendants were using only 700 of those slots. SMF 171; Hopkins\ndep., p. 19. Dr. Patel, Dr. DeBacher, Dr. Elliott, and Mr. Ingram\nhave all acknowledged that capable providers of integrated\ncommunity services for persons such as Plaintiffs exist. SMF 164,\n165. While this case has been pending, community service providers\nhave indicated that they serve persons more challenging than these\nplaintiffs. SMF 168. At the time of the lower court's\norder, L.C.\nhad been served by such a provider for over a year, and E.W. is now\nbeing served by the same provider.\nS_Y OF_tRGUMENT\nThis case involves a fairly simple issue of statutory\ninterpretation: whether the ADA's anti-discrimination mandate\nprohibits unnecessary segregation. The case also involves a fairly\nsimple issue regarding the Attorney General's implementing\nregulation [28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d)] that requires public entities to\nprovide services in the \"most integrated setting appropriate\" to a\ndisabled person's needs: whether the regulation is a reasonable\nconstruction of the ADA.\nThe express language of the ADA clearly equates unnecessary\nsegregation with discrimination. The legislative history clearly\nequates unnecessary institutionalization with segregation. Thus,\n15\n\nthe ADA prohibits unnecessary institutionalization. This comports\nwith the express finding in the ADA that discrimination persists in\nsuch critical areas as institutionalization.\nThe Attorney General's integration regulation is a reasonable\nconstruction of the ADA. It was issued at the specific direction\nof Congress. See 42 U.S.C. § 12134(a), (b). The regulation\ntherefore has the force of law as if passed by Congress itself.\nAdditionally, as the person charged with implementing Title II\nof the ADA, the Attorney General's regulation is entitled to\nsubstantial deference and should be given controlling weight unless\nit is clearly contrary to the statute. The Attorney General's\nregulation provides that public entities discriminate when they\nfail to provide services in the most integrated setting appropriate\nto a disabled person's needs. The Attorney General's regulation is\nconsistent with the detailed findings and purposes codified in the\nADA and the legislative history that unnecessary segregation and\ninstitutionalization are forms of discrimination. Therefore, the\nregulation is not clearly contrary to the statute, but is entirely\nconsonant with it.\nSimilarly, the Attorney General's consistent interpretation of\nthe regulation is entitled to substantial deference. The Attorney\nGeneral consistently has interpreted the integration regulation to\nprohibit unnecessarily segregated services, including unnecessary\ninstitutionalization. Unnecessary segregation is itself a form of\ndiscrimination, independent of the discrimination that arises when\nindividuals with disabilities receive different services than those\nprovided to individuals without disabilities. See Helen L. v.\nDiDario, 46 F.3d 325, 335 (3rd Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 116 S. Ct.\n16\n\n64 (1995), adopting the Attorney General's interpretation of the\nintegration regulation.\nDefendants have discriminated against plaintiffs by providing\nservices to the plaintiffs only in a segregated manner when the\nundisputed facts establish that plaintiffs are eligible for\nintegrated services. The qualified professionals agreed before\nthis lawsuit was filed, at the time it was filed, at the time the\nlower court entered its order, and at the time this case is now\nbeing heard by this Court that integrated services are appropriate\nfor plaintiffs. Indeed, over one year before the lower court\nissued its ruling, defendants began providing integrated services\nto Plaintiff L.C. And after this case was appealed to this Court,\ndefendants began providing integrated services to Plaintiff E.W.\nThe undisputed facts also establish that the defendants spend\nover 200 million dollars per year on both segregated and integrated\nservices. Thus, defendants cannot show that any substantial burden\nor fundamental alteration of their programs will be imposed if they\nare ordered to provide integrated services.\nIt is important to note that this case has nothing to do with\na claim for deinstitutionalization. Such a claim presupposes a\nper\ns_eeright to community-based services. Plaintiffs do not claim such\na right. In fact, plaintiffs do not claim that defendants are\nrequired to provide them with any services at all. What plaintiffs\ndo claim is that once defendants opt to provide them with services,\ndefendants must provide those services in the most integrated\nsetting appropriate to plaintiffs' needs.\nThe developing case law under the ADA, particularly Helen L.,\ncomports with plaintiffs' argument. Defendants' reliance on older\n17\n\n§ 504 cases is fundamentally flawed because those cases had nothing\nto do with the integration mandate of the ADA or the integration\nregulation. Every ADA case since\nHelen L., that has applied the\nintegration regulation with the benefit of the Attorney General's\ninterpretation to facts similar to those of this case, has agreed\nwith the holding in Helen L. that unnecessary institutionalization\nis a form of discrimination and thus violates the ADA.\nARGUMENT AND CITATION OF AUTHORITY\nI. DEFENDANTS HAVE VIOLATED THE ADA BY UNNECESSARILY PROVIDING\nSEGREGATED, RATHER THAN INTEGRATED, SERVICES TO PLAINTIFFS.\nA. INTRODUCTION\nPlaintiffs rely upon the following ADA provision in this case:\nSubject to the provisions of this subchapter, no\nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason\nof such disability, be excluded from participation in or\nbe denied the benefits of the services, programs, or\nactivities of a public entity, or be subjected to\ndiscrimination by any such entity.\n42 U.S.C. § 12132 (emphasis added).\nPlaintiffs also rely upon the Attorney General's implementing\nregulation issued at the specific direction of Congress:\nA public entity shall administer services, programs, and\nactivities in the most integrated setting appropriate to\nthe needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.\n28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d) (emphasis added).\nThis statute and regulation were enacted after both branches\nof Congress concluded:\nThere is a compelling need to provide a clear and\ncomprehensive national mandate for the elimination of\ndiscrimination against individuals with disabilities an___dd\nfor the integration of persons with disabilities into the\neconomic and social mainstream of American life.\nFurther, there is a need to provide clear, strong,\nconsistent, enforceable standards addressing\ndiscrimination against individuals with disabilities.\n18\n\nS. Rep. No. 116, 101st Cong., ist Sess. 20 (1989) (hereinafter S.\nRep. at __); H.R. Rep. No. 485(II), 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 50\n(1990) [hereinafter H.R. Rep. 485(__) at __] (emphasis added).\nUpon signing the ADA into law, President Bush reaffirmed the\nhistoric mandate of mainstreaming persons with disabilities:\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act presents us all with\nan historic opportunity. It signals the end to the\nunjustified seqreqation and exclusion of persons with\ndisabilities from the mainstream of American life.\n1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 602 (emphasis added).\nB. THE CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS\nUnlike § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, which was but a single\nsentence tacked onto a vocational rehabilitation bill, Congress\nwent to great lengths in the ADA, a bill comprising over 50 pages,\nto make specific findings and to make clear the comprehensive\nnature of the Act in order to \"ensure once and for all that no\nFederal agency or judge will ever misconstrue the congressional\nmandate to integrate people with disabilities into the mainstream.\"\n135 Cong. Rec. $4986 (daily ed. May 9, 1989) (statement of Sen.\nHarkin) (emphasis added). Senator Harkin, the ADA's sponsor and\nfloor manager in the Senate, was addressing Congress' view that the\nfederal agencies responsible for enforcing § 504 and many courts\nhad frustrated § 504's primary purpose of integrating persons with\ndisabilities into society's mainstream. As the House Report noted:\nMoreover, 17 years of experience with section 504 - in\nthe development and issuance of regulations, guidelines\nand standards, in the implementation of those\nrequirements, and in the interpretation of the law - have\ndemonstrated the need for further legislative action in\nthis area.\nH.R. Rep. No. 485(IV) at 24, reDrinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 513.\nOf-the nine detailed findings made by the Congress, the\n19\n\nfollowing are the most pertinent to this case:\n(2) Historically, society has tended to isolate\nand seqreqate individuals with disabilities,\nand, despite some improvements, such forms of\ndiscrimination against individuals with\ndisabilities continue to be a serious and\npervasive social problem;\n(3) Discrimination against individuals with\ndisabilities persists in such critical areas\nas ... institutionalization;\n(4) ... [I]ndividuals who have experienced\ndiscrimination on the basis of disability have\noften had no legal recourse ...;\n(5) Individuals with disabilities continually\nencounter various forms of discrimination,\nincluding outright intentional exclusion, ...\nfailure to make modifications to existing\nfacilities and practices, exclusionary\nqualification standards and criteria, [and]\nsegreqation ...;\n(8) The Nation's proper goals regarding\nindividuals with disabilities are to assure\nequality .of opportunity, full participation\n[and] independent living ....\n42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(2), (3), (4), (5), and (8) (emphasis added).\nThus, Congress left no doubt that unnecessary isolation,\nsegregation, and institutionalization of persons with disabilities\nare forms of discrimination under the ADA. It also made clear that\nfull participation in society should be assured.\nC. THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY\nPrior to its passage, Congress emphasized the comprehensive\nnature of the ADA to end segregation of persons with disabilities:\nThe ADA is a comprehensive piece of civil rights\nlegislation which promises a new future: a future of\ninclusion and inteqration, and the end of exclusion and\nsegregation.\n1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 449 (emphasis added).\nIn testifying to the need for a comprehensive law, Attorney\nGeneral Thornburgh, on behalf of President Bush, stated:\n2O\n\nOver the last 20 years, civil rights laws have been\nenacted in piecemeal fashion. Thus, existing Federal\nlaws are like a patchwork quilt in need of repair. There\nare holes in the fabric, serious gaps in coverage that\nleave persons with disabilities without adequate civil\nrights protections.\nS. Rep. at 19; H.R. Rep. No. 485(II) at 48.\nThe Attorney General specifically noted that the holes in the\nfabric included the Rehabilitation Act:\nFifteen years have gone by since the Rehabilitation Act\ntook effect. Nevertheless, persons with disabilities are\nstill too often shut out of the economic and social\nmainstream of American life.\nADA: Hearing before the Subcomm. on the Handicapped of the Senate\nComm. on Labor and Human Resources, 101st Cong., Ist Sess. 195\n(1989) (hereinafter \"Hearing\" at __) (emphasis added). Thus, the\nAttorney General stressed that it was important to bring persons\nwith disabilities into the mainstream of society, \"in other words,\nfull participation in and access to all aspects of society.\" H.R.\nRep. No. 485(II) at 35, reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 317.\nCongress clearly intended the ADA's civil rights protections\nto be used for ending unnecessarily segregated services in\ninstitutions. For example, Republican Senator Weicker, the\noriginal sponsor of the ADA and a former Chair of the Senate\nSubcommittee on the Handicapped, testified before that Committee:\nFor years this country has maintained a public policy of\nprotectionism towards people with disabilities. We have\ncreated monoliths of isolated care in institutions and in\nsegregated educational settings. It is that isolation\nand seqregation that has become the basis of the\ndiscrimination faced by many disabled people today.\nSeparate is not equal. It was not for blacks; it is not\nfor the disabled.\nHearing at 215. Additional examples abound. Said Congressman\nMiller, a co-sponsor of the ADA in the House:\n... it has been our unwillingness to see all people with\n21\n\ndisabilities that has been the greatest barrier to full\nand meaningful equality.\nSociety has made them invisible\nby shutting them away in seqreqated facilities ....\n136 Cong. Rec. H2447 (daily ed. May 17, 1990) (emphasis added). 9\nIn a similar vein, Senator Harkin stated that the ADA:\nguarantees individuals with disabilities the right to be\ninteqrated into the economic and social mainstream of\nsociety; seqreqation and isolation by others will no\nlonger be tolerated.\n135 Cong. Rec. S10713 (daily ed. September 7, 1989) (emphasis\nadded). Rep. Collins, also a co-sponsor of the ADA, stated that\nthe \"basic goal which runs through this landmark civil rights\nlegislation ... is to fully inteqrate disabled Americans into all\naspects of life in our country.\" 136 Cong. Rec. H2603 (daily ed.\nMay 22, 1990) (emphasis added).\nSenator Kennedy, a co-sponsor and chair of the Senate\ncommittee that considered the ADA, declared that:\nThe Americans With Disabilities Act will end this\nAmerican apartheid. It will roll back the unthinking\nand unacceptable practices by which disabled Americans\ntoday are seqreqated, excluded, and fenced off from fair\nparticipation in our society by mindless biased attitudes\nand senseless physical barriers.\n135 Cong. Rec. S4993 (daily ed. May 9, 1989) (emphasis added).\nThe above views were in accord with the House Report that\n\"[d]iscrimination against people with disabilities includes\nsegregation .... \" (H.R. Rep. No. 485(II) at 29, reprinted in 1990\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 310) and the Senate Report that \"one of the most\ndebilitating forms of discrimination is segregation imposed by\n9The legislative history contains several references to\ndiscrimination through institutionalization. See, _, H.R. Rep.\nNo. 485(II) at 31, reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 312; S. Rep. at\n8; 135 Cong. Rec. S4985 (daily ed. May 9, 1989).\n22\n\nothers.\" S. Rep. at 6. Congress could not have been clearer that\ninstitutionalization is segregation and that unnecessary\nsegregation is discrimination.\nAs noted above, Senator Weicker correctly noted that just as\nseparate is not equal for blacks, separate is not equal for the\ndisabled. This theme recurs throughout the legislative history.\nFor example, Congress repeatedly invoked\nBrown v. Board of\nEducation and its language as a basis for prohibiting segregation\nbased upon disability:\n[A]s in the finding 35 years ago by the Supreme Court in\nBrown v. Board of Education, in referring to the\neducation of black students, ... segregation for persons\nwith disabilities \"may affect their hearts and minds in\na way unlikely to ever be undone.'\nH.R. Rep. No. 485(III) at 26, reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 448-\n49; see also S. Rep. at 6; 136 Cong. Rec. H2639 (daily ed. May 22,\n1990) (\"We have been moved by the continuing destructive effect of\nsegregation, and we are acting now to reverse those practices, root\nand branch .... \") (statement of Rep. Dellums); 136 Cong. Rec. H2441\n(daily ed. May 17, 1990) (statement of Rep. Brooks).\nThe Supreme Court previously had recognized that the same\nbigotry that infected attitudes about race also infected attitudes\ntowards the disabled. In analyzing much of the early twentieth\ncentury literature and \"science\" advocating the segregation of\npersons with disabilities, Justice Marshall noted that \"[a] regime\nof state-mandated segregation and degradation soon emerged that in\nits virulence and bigotry rivaled, and indeed paralleled, the worst\nexcesses of Jim Crow.\" City of Cleburne, Texas v. Cleburne Living\nCenter, 473 U.S. 432, 462, 105 S. Ct. 3249, 3266, 87 L.Ed.2d 313\n(1985) (Marshall, J., concurring and dissenting in part). The\n23\n\nstate regime included \"[m]assive\ncustodial institutions ... built\nto warehouse the retarded for life.\" I_dd. (emphasis added).\nA majority of the Supreme Court agreed that the above-\ndescribed history was \"lengthy and tragic\" and was one of \"unfair\nand often grotesque mistreatment.\" Id., 473 U.S. at 454, 461, 105\nS. Ct. at 3262, 3266.\nIn this more enlightened time, no Court would even suggest\nthat it is not discrimination to segregate or provide segregated\nservices to black people. The same conclusion should be drawn for\nthe mentally disabled. It is obvious that institutions segregate\nthe mentally disabled. To require them to receive services in this\nsetting unnecessarily is a prime example of the type of\ndiscrimination that Congress intended to prohibit when it passed\nthe ADA.\nD. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S INTEGRATION REGUIg_TION PROHIBITS\nUNNECESSARILY SEGREGATED SERVICES, HAS THE FORCE OF LAW,\nAND IS ENTITLED TO DEFERENCE.\nAs noted above, Congress made extensive findings of pervasive\ndiscrimination still in existence 17 years after enactment of §\n504. In order to eliminate this discrimination, Congress directed\nthe Attorney General to issue regulations:\n... consistent with this chapter [the ADA] and with the\ncoordination regulations under part 41 of title 28, Code\nof Federal Regulations (as promulgated by the Department\nof Health, Education, and Welfare on January 13, 1978),\napplicable to recipients of Federal financial assistance\nunder section 794 of title 29 [section 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act of 1973].\n42 U.S.C. § 12134(b). I°\n1°Unlike the other titles of the ADA, Congress did not list all\nforms of prohibited discrimination in Title II. Rather, it\n24\n\nSignificantly, Congress gave a very specific mandate.\nCongress\ncould have chosen to give a general instruction to issue\nregulations as it normally does. It did not. Congress also could\nhave required the issuance of regulations consistent with other\nexisting § 504 regulations. It did not. Instead, Congress\ndirected the issuance of regulations consistent with a particular\npart of existing regulations issued on a particular date.\nThe particular part of the § 504 regulations that Congress\ndirected the Attorney General to adopt required covered entities to\n\"administer programs and activities in the most integrated setting\nappropriate to the needs of qualified handicapped persons.\" 28\nC.F.R. § 41.51(d). Other § 504 regulations issued by the\nDepartment of HHS (the successor agency to HEW) do not contain an\nintegration regulation at all. See 45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b). Rather\nthan choose HHS § 504 regulations without an integrated setting\nrequirement, Congress chose the Attorney General's § 504\ncoordination regulations with an integrated setting requirement, n\ndeliberately left this task to the Attorney General. See H.R. Rep.\nNo. 485(II) at 52, reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 475; see also\nHelen L., 46 F.3d at 332.\nnDefendants argue that the ADA only applies to differences in\ntreatment between disabled individuals and non-disabled\nindividuals. However, Congress did not direct the Attorney General\nto adopt HHS regulations that imposed such a requirement. See 45\nC.F.R. § 84.4(b)(2) which required integration only in the context\nof providing services for disabled persons that are equal to\nservices provided to nondisabled persons. Instead, Congress\ndirected the Attorney General to adopt a regulation in which the\n25\n\nThe Attorney General complied with the Congressional command\nand issued an ADA Title II regulation which provides that:\nA public entity shall administer services, programs, and\nactivities\nin the most inteqrated settinq appropriate to\nthe needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.\n28\" C.F.R. § 35.130(d) (emphasis added).\nThe Congressional command also required the Attorney General\nto promulgate Title II regulations \"consistent with\" the rest of\nthe ADA. The Attorney General's regulation meets this requirement.\nFor example, Title III prohibits discrimination in the form of\nfailing to provide services \"in the most integrated setting\nappropriate to the needs of the individual.\" 42 U.S.C. §\n12182(b)(1)(B). The Attorney General's regulation incorporates\nthis language almost verbatim.\nThe Title III integration requirement is independent of other\nprovisions in Title III proscribing discrimination only in terms of\ndiffering treatment between disabled and non-disabled persons. 42\nU.S.C. § 12182(b)(1)(A)(ii), (iii). This distinction made by the\nCongress demonstrates that the Congress knew when it wanted to tie\nprohibited discrimination to differences in treatment between the\ndisabled and the nondisabled.\nIn similar fashion, the Attorney General's regulations include\nprovisions that apply only to situations where the disabled are\ntreated differently from the nondisabled. See, e.-g_, 28 C.F.R. §\n35.130(b)(I). If, as argued by Defendants, 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d)\napplied only to services that are offered to both the disabled and\nthe nondisabled, then 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(I), which prohibits a\nfailure to integrate is discrimination by itself.\n26\n\npublic entity from providing separate or different services to\npersons with disabilities than is provided to others, would be\nredundant. However, an interpretation of a regulation which\nresults in another portion of the regulation becoming \"redundant\"\nor' \"pure surplusage\" is disfavored. Mackey v. Lanier Collection\nAqency and Service, Inc., 486 U.S. 825, 837, 108 S. Ct. 2182, 2189,\ni00 L.Ed.2d 836 (1988); Cammarano v. U.S., 358 U.S. 498, 505, 79 S.\nCt. 524, 3 L.Ed.2d 462, 467 (1959). In short, the failure to\nprovide services in the most integrated setting appropriate to a\ndisabled person's needs is an independent form of discrimination.\nThe Attorney General also has provided guidance regarding the\nmeaning of the integration regulation that comports with the clear\nlegislative intent discussed earlier. For example, in mandating\nthe delivery of services \"in the most integrated setting,\" the\nAttorney General has defined that setting as one \"that enables\nindividuals with disabilities to interact with non-disabled persons\nto the fullest extent possible.\" 28 C.F.R. pt. 35, app. A § 35.130\nat 469 (1996). The Attorney General has also made clear that \"an\nimportant and overarching principle of the Americans with\nDisabilities Act\" is that:\nSeparate, special, or different programs that are\ndesigned to provide a benefit to persons with\ndisabilities cannot be used to restrict the participation\nof persons with disabilities in general, integrated\nactivities.\nI_dd. at 467. In other words, \"[i]ntegration is fundamental to the\npurposes of the American with Disabilities Act. Provision of\nsegregated accommodations and services relegates persons with\ndisabilities to second-class status.\" Id. at 466.\nAfter complying with the Congressional mandate and issuing an\n27\n\nintegration regulation, the Attorney General consistently has\noffered the same interpretation of the integration regulation:\nBoth the Section 504 regulations and the ADA make clear\nthat the unnecessary segregation of individuals with\ndisabilities in the provision of public services is\nitself a form of discrimination within the meaning of\n' those statutes, independent of the discrimination that\narises when individuals with disabilities receive\ndifferent services than those provided to individuals\nwithout disabilities.\nSee Brief of Attorney General filed in\nHelen L. v. DiDario, 46 F.3d\n325 (3rd Cir. 1995), cert. denied, __ U.S. __, 116 S. Ct. 64\n(1995) R7-71-Exh. 3 at p. 7. The Attorney General's position set\nforth above was quoted with complete approval by the Third Circuit\nin Helen L., 46 F.3d at 335.\nThe Attorney General consistently has taken the same position\nin Williams v. Wasserman, 937 F. Supp. 524 (D. Md. 1996) (R7-71-\nExh. 4); Wyatt v. Hanan, CV-3195-N (M.D. Ala. 1995) (R7-71-Exh. 5);\nand United States v. State of Connecticut, CV-N-86-252-EBB (D.\nConn. 1996). R7-71-Exh. 6.\nAs the person charged with implementing the ADA, 12 the\n12The Attorney General was given numerous responsibilities under the\nADA: I) to promulgate and implement regulations [42 U.S.C. §S\n12134, 12186(b)]; 2) to provide guidance and technical assistance\nto covered entities [42 U.S.C. § 12206]; 3) to conduct compliance\nreviews [42 U.S.C. § 12188]; 4) to coordinate conflicts between\nagencies on their interpretations and regulations [42 U.S.C. §\n12117]; and 5) to file enforcement actions in federal court [42\nU.S.C. §§ 12117, 12133, and 12188]. With respect to Title II, the\nAttorney General has issued regulations and a Technical Assistance\nManual interpreting Title II. See 28 C.F.R. part 35 (1996); The\n28\n\nAttorney General's interpretation of the ADA is entitled to\nsubstantial deference. See Blum v. Bacon, 457 U.S. 132, 141, 102\nS. Ct. 2355, 2361, 72 L.Ed.2d 728 (1982); Paralyzed Veterans of\nAmerica v. D.C. Arena L.P., 1997 _ 358173 at 6-7 (D.C. Cir. July\ni,' 1997). Thus, the Attorney General's interpretation should be\ngiven controlling weight unless it is arbitrary, capricious, or\nmanifestly contrary to the statute. See Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v.\nNatural Resources Defense Council, 467 U.S. 837, 844, 104 S. Ct.\n2778, 2782-83, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). Given the text of the ADA\nand the overwhelming legislative history emphasizing integration\ninto the mainstream of society and condemning segregation, the\nAttorney General's integration regulation is not arbitrary,\ncapricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.\nThe law is also well established that an agency's consistent\ninterpretation of its own regulation is entitled to substantial\ndeference. Thomas Jefferson University v. Shalala, 512 U.S. 504,\n114 S. Ct. 2381, 2386, 129 L.Ed.2d 405 (1994). The Court's\n... task is not to decide which among several competing\ninterpretations best serves the regulatory purpose.\nRather, the agency's interpretation must be given\n\"controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or\ninconsistent with the regulation.'\nI__dd. Given the text of the ADA and the legislative history equating\nunnecessary institutionalization with segregation and\ndiscrimination and repudiating \"monoliths of isolated care in\ninstitutions,\" the Attorney General's interpretation of her own\nregulation, far from being plainly erroneous, is the only\nreasonable interpretation of it.\nAmericans With Disabilities Act Title II Technical Assistance\nManual (1993).\n29\n\nFinally, it should be noted that because the Attorney\nGeneral's integration regulation comports with a specific statutory\ndirective from Congress,\nCongress essentially voiced its approval\nof the integration regulation. The regulation therefore has the\nsame effect as if passed by Congress. See United States v. Board\nof Comm'rs of Sheffield, Alabama, 435 U.S. 110, 134, 98 S. Ct. 965,\n980-81, 55 L.Ed.2d 148 (1978); Helen L., 46 F.3d at 332. 13\nDefendants argue strenuously, with barely a word about the\nAttorney General's integration regulation, that plaintiffs have not\nbeen discriminated against \"because of\" their disabilities.\nDefendants fail to recognize that unnecessary segregation is\ndiscrimination and this discrimination occurs only because of\ndisability. More importantly, defendants ignore the fact that the\nintegration regulation definitively provides that unnecessary\nsegregation is discrimination because of disability and that the\nAttorney General consistently has advanced this interpretation.\nSince defendants make no argument that the regulation is an abuse\nof the Attorney General's discretion, they do not even advance an\nargument on which the Court could strike down this interpretation.\nPlaintiffs emphasize that they do not claim a right to\nservices at all, only a right to receive services, once defendants\nopt to provide them, in the most integrated setting appropriate to\n13HHS, through HCFA, has recently adopted the same interpretation\nas the Attorney General of the ADA and the integration regulation:\nUnder the ADA and regulations written at 28 CFR 130(d)\n(sic), a State must not place or keep in an institutional\nfacility any person who could be served more\nappropriately in a community-based setting.\nExh. 1 at p. 2 attached hereto.\n30\n\ntheir needs. Defendants refuse to recognize plaintiffs' claim that\ndefendants institutionalized L.C. and E.W. for the provision of\ndisability services and then failed to administer those services in\nthe most integrated setting appropriate to their needs when\ninstitutional care no longer was needed (a claim within the four\ncorners of an explicit ADA regulation).\nThere is a significant difference between a per se right to an\nintegrated service (which plaintiffs do not claim) and a right to\nreceive a service, which a public entity chooses to provide, in a\nsetting that is the most integrated setting appropriate to the\nindividual's needs. Thus, if defendants did not provide segregated\nservices in an institution or if plaintiffs\nrequired segregated\nservices through institutional care, plaintiffs would have no claim\nunder 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d) to receive services in a more\nintegrated setting. Because neither of those scenarios is present\nin this case, defendants have violated 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d). 14\nII. THE DISTRICT COURT'S DECISION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE\nDEVELOPING CASELAW ON THE ADA AND THE CONGRESSIONAL\nINTENT THAT PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES BE MAINSTREAMED.\nThe district court correctly held that unnecessary\ninstitutional segregation of a disabled individual constitutes\n14Although not directly on point, this Court has held, in the\nemployment context of the ADA, that the \"because of\" standard for\ndetermining liability under the ADA \"conveys the idea of a factor\nthat made a difference in the outcome.\" McNely v. 0cala Star-\nBanner Corp., 99 F.3d 1068, 1077 (llth Cir. 1996). Certainly,\nplaintiffs' disabilities in this case were a factor that made a\ndifference in how they were treated.\n31\n\ndiscrimination\nper se, which cannot be justified by a lack of\nfunding. R8-80-8. That holding is consistent with virtually all\nof the recent caselaw construing the ADA and the integration\nregulation. The leading case on this issue, which was relied upon\nby'the district court, is Helen L. v. DiDario, 46 F. 3d 325 (3rd\nCir. 1995), cert. denieR, U.S. __, 116 S. Ct. 64 (1995).\nIn Helen L., the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare\n(\"DPW\") had designed an attendant care program to provide services\nthat would enable persons to live in their homes and communities\nrather than in institutions. Id. at 327. Despite the existence of\nthis program, DPW required Idell S. to receive necessary care\nservices in the segregated setting of a nursing home rather than in\nher own home. The parties agreed that Idell S. qualified for the\nreceipt of services in her home, but DPW refused to provide those\nservices due to alleged lack of funding. I__dd.at 329.\nAfter carefully examining the legislative history, the\nCongressional findings in the ADA, the Attorney General's\nintegration regulation, and Supreme Court case law that requires\ndeference to agency regulations, the Third Circuit held:\nThus, the ADA and its attendant regulations clearly\ndefine unnecessary segregation as a form of illegal\ndiscrimination against the disabled. Accordingly, the\ndistrict court erred in holding that the applicable\nprovisions of the ADA \"may not be invoked unless there is\nfirst a finding of discrimination.'\nI_dd. at 333.\nIn so holding, the Court adopted the Attorney General's\ninterpretation of her own regulation in finding that this\nparticular prohibition is not tied to disparate treatment of the\ndisabled and the nondisabled:\nThe 504 coordination regulations, and the ADA \"make clear\n32\n\nthat the unnecessary segregation of individuals with\ndisabilities in the provision of public services is\nitself a form of discrimination within the meaning of\nthose statutes, independent of the discrimination that\narises when individuals with disabilities receive\ndifferent services than those provided to individuals\nwithout disabilities.'\nId _. at 335, quoting the Attorney General's brief.\nDefendants' ADA argument hinges on their contention that to\nprove a violation of the ADA, a disabled plaintiff must show a\ndifference in treatment to someone who is not disabled. But as the\nThird Circuit reasoned, this argument does not make any sense in\nthe context of institutions because we do not institutionalize the\nnondisabled. Congress stated unequivocally that discrimination\npersisted in the area of institutionalization. 42 U.S.C. §\n12101(a)(3). As noted in\nHelen L.:\nIf Congress were only concerned about disparate treatment\nof the disabled as compared to their nondisabled\ncounterparts, this statement would be a non sequitur as\nonly disabled persons are institutionalized.\nId. at 336.\nUnder the Defendants' argument, a disabled plaintiff who is\nunnecessarily provided segregated services in an institution could\nnever prove an ADA violation. Such a result would defeat the\nstatutory language regarding segregation and institutionalization\nand the legislative history condemning segregated services and\nmandating the integration of persons with disabilities into the\nmainstream of society.\nSince the Third Circuit issued its decision in Helen L., every\nfederal court in the country, when confronted with alleged\nviolations of the ADA and the integration regulation, has followed\nHelen L.\nFor example, in Charles Q. v. Houstoun, 15 ADD 691, 1996 WL\n33\n\n447549 (M.D. Penn. 1996), the court granted summary judgment to two\nindividual plaintiffs who, just like the plaintiffs in this case,\nshowed that the state discriminated against them under the ADA by\nconfining them to a state psychiatric hospital when the plaintiffs\nqualified for community-based services. I_dd.at 703.\nIn\nWilliams v. Wasserman, the court cited Helen L. favorably\nin holding that unnecessarily confining persons with mental\ndisabilities violated the ADA and the integration regulation. 937\nF. Supp. at 530-31. The court rejected the argument that the ADA\nonly protects persons with disabilities from discrimination in\nrelation to non-disabled persons. I__dd. Finally, the court agreed\nwith Helen L. that an ADA claim \"... does not require a showing of\ndiscrimination between different groups or subgroups of disabled\nindividuals.\" I_dd.\nIn Messier v. Southbury Traininq School, 916 F. Supp. 133 (D.\nConn. 1996), the named plaintiffs sued on behalf of a class of\nmentally retarded individuals confined to a state institution\nseeking an order requiring the state to evaluate all residents for\npossible community placements regardless of the severity or nature\nof their disabilities. I_dd.at 136-137. In denying the defendants'\nmotion to dismiss, the court cited Helen L. favorably, held that\nthe integration regulation is entitled to deference, and found that\nunder the ADA, the defendants were \"... prohibited from refusing to\nconsider certain residents for possible community placement, merely\nbased upon the degree of their disabilities.\" I_dd. at 141-142.\nOther decisions interpreting the ADA and its predecessor, §\n504 of the Rehabilitation Act, have reached the same conclusion\nthat unnecessarily segregated services are prohibited and that\n34\n\nintegrated services aimed at bringing the disabled into the\nmainstream of society are required. These and other cases\nillustrate that the § 504 case law (which includes the cases cited\nby defendants discussed further below) is not monolithic as\ndefendants suggest.\nSee, e.q., Halderman v. Pennhurst State Sch.\nand Hosp., 784 F. Supp. 215, 224 (E.D. Pa. 1992), aff'd, 977 F.2d\n568 (3rd Cir. 1992) (§ 504 prohibits unnecessary segregation and\nrequires reasonable accommodations to provide opportunities for\nintegration); Coleman v. Zatechka, 824 F. Supp. 1360, 1373 (D. Neb.\n1993) (in enacting the ADA, Congress \"aimed to bring people with\ndisabilities into society's mainstream, to cause the kinds of\ninteraction which may facilitate recognition of the true equality\nof human worth as between individuals - regardless of\ndisabilities.\"); Jackson v. Ft. Stanton Hosp. and Traininq Sch.,\n757 F. Supp. 1243, 1299 (D. N.M. 1990), aff'd in part, rev'd in\npart on other qrounds, 964 F.2d 980 (10th Cir. 1992) (\"Where\nreasonable accommodations in community programs can be made,\ndefendants' failure to integrate severely handicapped residents\ninto community programs ... violates § 504.\"); Martin v. Voinovich,\n840 F. Supp. 1175, 1191-92 (S.D. Ohio 1993); Homeward Bound, Inc.\nv. Hissom Memorial Center, 1987 WL 27104 at 20 (N.D. Okla. 1987).\nIn non-institutional cases, both federal and state courts cite\nHelen L. favorably in finding that the ADA is intended to usher in\na new day for the disabled and to provide protection where S 504 of\nthe Rehabilitation Act had failed. Heather K. by Anita K. v. City\nof Mallard, Iowa, 887 F. Supp. 1249, 1263-1266 (N.D. Iowa 1995);\nFink v. Kitzman, 881 F. Supp. 1347, 1368-1371 (N.D. Iowa 1995);\nCity of.Moorpark v. Superior Court of the County of Ventura, 43\n35\n\nCal. App. 4th 728, 736-37, 50 Cal. Rptr. 2d 816, 821-22 (1996);\nFell v. Spokane Transit Authority, 128 Wash.2d 618, 628, 911 P.2d\n1319, 1324 (1996).\nIn sum, the developing ADA case law is on track with the\nCongressional mandate that unnecessary segregation of the disabled\nis discrimination. Helen L. is the definitive case on this issue.\nThis case is on all fours with Helen L., a thoughtful and well-\nconsidered opinion that this Court should follow.\nDefendants' fallback argument is that a disabled person must\nshow discrimination based upon the severity of a disability.\nPlaintiffs disagree. See Helen L., 46 F.3d at 335; Wasserman, 937\nF. Supp. at 530-31. Assuming for the sake of argument that\nDefendants are correct, it ought to be obvious that only the more\nseverely disabled are subjected to institutionalization, the most\nsegregated setting for disability services. In any event,\ndefendants have admitted to such discrimination.\nL.C. was first placed at GRH-A because of her psychiatric\nillness, but she remained there because staff were unfamiliar with\nmental retardation community services and because her multiple\ndisabilities made placement difficult. Bliss dep., p. 54, i. ii-\n21. For example, GRH-A staff contended that it was \"impossible\"\nfor L.C. to be eligible for the medicaid waiver program that\neventually provided her with a community placement. SMF 100; R5-\n59-Exh. 29. By contrast, professionals who have a background and\nexperience in mental retardation placements deal with the program\non a regular basis. Ingram dep., p. 17, i. i - p. 19, i. 2.\nSimilarly, E.W. was not integrated into the community, in\npart, because she suffers from mental retardation, mental illness\n36\n\nand a kidney ailment. The deposition testimony of E.W.'s treatment\nteam is replete with references to the Defendants' failure to\nintegrate persons into the community who suffer from a combination\nof disabilities. Bliss dep., p. 54, i. 11-21; Patel II dep., p.\n32, i. 21 - p. 33, i. 12; DeBacher dep., p. 26, I. 14-25, p. 27, i.\n1-5; Ingram dep., p. 15, I. 13 - p. 16, i. 16; Parrish dep., p. 25,\ni. 17 - p. 27, i. 3, p. 34, i. 14-18, p. 35, i. 16 - p. 36, i. 3;\nSteed dep., p. 61, i. 20 - p. 62, i. 2.\nA good example of defendants' admission that they discriminate\nbased upon the severity of one's disability is the report of DHR's\nDual Disabilities Task Force issued in June, 1991. R5-59-Exh. 63.\nThat report recommends that community placements, particularly\ngroup homes, need to be created for persons who suffer from both\nmental retardation and mental illness because\nthey \"... are\nprobably \"the most in need.'\" Id. at p. 15. Providing group homes\nin the community \" . would counteract the void in services for\nmildly retarded individuals created during the last 15 years.\" Id.\nThis is a clear admission that persons with a combination of\ncertain disabilities are not provided community services.\nIn sum, Defendants delayed integrating L°C. and E.W. into the\ncommunity for months, if not years, based upon the combination and\nseverity of their disabilities.\nIII. DEFENDANTS\" RELIANCE ON _ 504 CASES THATADOPT THE WRONG _ 504\nSTANDARD IS FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED.\nDefendants cite several cases, primarily older § 504 cases, in\nsupport of their argument that the ADA does not prohibit\ndiscrimination against the disabled, unless they are treated\ndifferently from the nondisabled. Before discussing the cases upon\n37\n\nwhich Defendants rely, it is important to note the major fallacy in\nDefendants' argument.\nThe crux of Defendants' argument is that when Congress passed\nTitle II of the\n/iDA, all it intended to do was extend § 504 to\npublic entities. In doing so, Defendants argue, Congress extended\n§ 504 standards to the ADA. Defendants then make the leap that\nCongress also intended to adopt all of the case law construing §\n504. Defendants therefore cite, as binding authority under the\nADA, several § 504 cases which they believe support their position.\nThe basic premise in defendant's argument, however, is\nfactually incorrect. It is true that Congress, in enacting the\nADA, intended to extend the non-discrimination principles of § 504\nto public entities. That extension, however, was a means to an\nend. The legislative history and explicit Congressional findings\nin the ADA itself, which were discussed earlier, ma_e abundantly\nclear that the end that Congress sought was \"to provide a clear and\ncomprehensive national mandate for ... the integration of persons\nwith disabilities into the economic and social mainstream of\nAmerican life.\" S. Rep. at 20; H.R. Rep. No. 485(II) at 50.\nIntegrated services are the real end to Title II of the ADA. If\nall that Congress intended to do was extend § 504 to public\nentities, Congress could simply have amended § 504 by adding two\nwords, \"public entities.\"\nAs already noted, the legislative history als0 reveals\nCongress' and the Attorney General's belief that \"17 years of\nexperience with section 504 ... and in the interpretation of the\nlaw have demonstrated the need for further legislative action in\nthis area,\" and that despite § 504, \"persons with disabilities are\n38\n\nstill too often shut out of the economic and social mainstream of\nAmerican life. \"15 Congress would not have expressed such\ndissatisfaction with § 504 and the case law under that section if\nall it intended by enacting the ADA was to extend § 504 to public\nentities.\nDefendants' erroneous factual premise, even if accepted for\nthe sake of argument, does not support the conclusion. Just\nbecause Congress intended to extend the principles of § 504 to the\nADA does not mean that Congress intended to adopt all of the case\nlaw construing § 504. Both plaintiffs and defendants have cited to\ndifferent § 504 cases that support their positions in this case.\nGiven the wide array of conflicting and confusing § 504 case law,\nCongress could not possibly have intended to adopt all of it.\nHowever, one of the principal court opinions Congress did cite\nwith approval in the legislative history on Title II of the ADA was\nJudge Mansmann's opinion in ADAPT v. Skinner, 881 F.2d 1184 (3rd\nCir. 1989):\nAs with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act,\nintegrated services are essential to accomplishing the\npurposes of title II. As stated by Judge Mansmann in\nADAPT v. Skinner, \"the goal [is to] eradicat[e] the\n\"invisibility of the handicapped.'\"\nH.R. Rep. No. 485(IV) at 50, reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 473.\nThis passage was not an isolated reference to Judge Mansmann's\nopinion. The legislative history Contains numerous statements to\nthe effect that Congress was adopting Judge Mansmann's standard in\nthe ADAPT case. For example, Senator Harkin avowed that:\nIn other words, mainstreaming of people with disabilities\n15H.R. Rep. No. 485(IV) at 24, reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 513;\nHearing at 195 (emphasis added).\n39\n\nis one of the essential principles of section 504. Thus,\nthe majority opinion of the three judge panel of the\nThird Circuit Court of Appeals in Adapt versus Burnley\nwas correct when it said that section 504 was designed to\nemancipate people with disabilities and that\nmainstreaming is required ....\n135 Cong. Rec. S4986 (daily ed. May 9, 1989). Senator Cranston, a\nco-sponsor of the ADA and the principal author of § 504, stated\nthat \"[o]ur bill would codify the reasoning of the recent decision\nof the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Americans\nDisabled for Accessible Public Transportation v. Burnley, 867 F.2d\n1471 (1989). ''16 135 Cong. Rec. S4997 (daily ed. May 9, 1989).\nSince the Congress intended to codify the reasoning of Judge\nMansmann, it is important to look more closely at his opinion. One\nof the main issues in ADAPT was whether newly purchased buses had\nto be equipped with wheelchair lifts. The majority opinion held\nthat the Department of Transportation's decision not to implement\nmainstreaming, i.e., not to require all buses to be accessible, but\nrather to allow local transit authorities to use separate\nparatransit buses for disabled persons, did not violate § 504. In\n16The Senators' citations to Burnley refer to the advance sheets\nedition of the Federal Reporter. Judge Mansmann's panel opinion in\nADAPT v. Burnley was vacated by the Third Circuit en banc in ADAPT\nv. Skinner (case renamed on appeal) and was not included in the\nbound edition of the Federal Reporter. Judge Mansmann then\ndissented from the Skinner e__nnbanc decision. Judge Mansmann\nadopted the same § 504 standard in both his Burnley decision and in\nhis Skinner dissenting opinion which Congress clearly adopted.\nInterestingly, Judge Mansmann was also one of the Third Circuit\njudges who decided Helen L.\n40\n\ndissenting from the majority opinion, Judge Mansmann wrote that §\n504 did require mainstreaming such that disabled persons could ride\nbuses with nondisabled persons. ADAP___8_8_1TT,F.2d at 1204. Judge\nMansmann relied, in part, on the requirement that services must be\n\"provided in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs\nof participating handicapped persons.\" Id. at 1204, n. i.\nThe passage quoted above demonstrates Congress' fundamental\nunderstanding, contrary to the § 504 cases cited by defendants in\nthis case, that the § 504 standard that Congress was adopting was\none of\ninteqrated services. According to Judge Mansmann, it was\nnot enough that separate paratransit services were provided for the\ndisabled. Section 504 required mainstreaming in the form of\ninteqrated services. I_dd. at 1204. Similarly, it is not enough in\nthis case to provide separate services in an institution.\nIn sum, even assuming that only § 504 standards apply to the\nADA, defendants have argued for a § 504 standard completely\ncontrary to the Congressional mandate expressed in the ADA and that\nJudge Mansmann correctly noted did not apply to § 504. The correct\nstandard requires the defendants, once they undertake to provide\nservices, to provide integrated services when the evidence shows\nthat persons qualify for such services. Here, the evidence is\nundisputed that plaintiffs qualify for integrated services.\nOnce the proper standard adopted by the Congress is\nunderstood, it becomes clear that defendants' reliance on several\ncases that completely failed to follow that standard is\nfundamentally flawed.\nDefendants rely heavily on this Circuit's decision in S.H.v.\nEdwards, 860 F.2d 1045 (llth Cir. 1988), as well as the lower\n41\n\ncourt's decision in that case. S.H. had nothing to do with the ADA\nor the integration regulation under either the ADA or § 504. On\nappeal, this Court engaged in no analysis of the § 504 claim but\nmerely adopted the lower court's decision. The lower court\ndecision dealt extensively with the Fourteenth Amendment claim and\ndevoted a mere two paragraphs to the § 504 claim.\nWith regard to the § 504 claim, the plaintiffs in S.H. alleged\na\nprocedural violation, i.e., that they had illegally been denied\nhabilitation reviews. The lower court made very clear that it was\ndenying procedural relief (as opposed to substantive relief)\n\"because the facts of this case do not support the contention that\nplaintiffs were denied O.C.G.A. § 37-4-42 habilitation reviews\n\"solely by reason of [their] handicap,' as the statute requires.\"\nI__dd.at 1052. The court went on to find that the state legislature\nproperly acted within its prerogative in establishing a bright line\nrule for when habilitation reviews would be provided. Thus,\nplaintiffs were not denied habilitation reviews solel_ by reason of\ntheir handicap. I__dd. Of course, Congress deleted the \"solely\"\nrequirement in the ADA, so that the lower court's ruling in S.H.\nhas no bearing on this case. 17 Finally, the plaintiffs in S.H_,\nunlike the plaintiffs here, did not seek existing services.\nSince the Court's decision in S.H., this Court has recognized\nthat Congress deliberately made the ADA more expansive than § 504\niVThe lower court in S.H. also noted that it was not adopting the\nMagistrate's recommendation that § 504 does not apply to\ndifferences in treatment based upon the nature and severity of the\ndisability. I_dd. Plaintiffs here have been treated differently\nbased upon the nature and severity of their disabilities.\n42\n\nby refusing to limit Title II to discrimination \"solel_ on the\nbasis of disability.\" McNel_, 99 F.3d at 1074-75. Congress\nrecognized that if it so limited the ADA, the ADA would not reach\nall discriminatory conduct that Congress intended to reach. Thus,\nas'noted previously, this Court held in McNel_ that a violation of\nthe ADA is shown simply when a person's disability is a factor that\nmade a difference in how the person was treated. I_dd.at 1077.\nSimilarly,\nP.C.v. McLauqhlin, 913 F.2d. 1033 (2d. Cir. 1990)\nhad nothing to do to with the ADA or the integration regulation.\nInstead, P.C. was a § 504 case for damages in which the primary\nissue was whether defendants were protected by qualified immunity.\nBecause plaintiffs could not show that prior case law \"clearly\nestablish[ed]\" § 504 liability, as one must do in the face of a\nqualified immunity defense, the court dismissed plaintiffs' claim.\nAs with S.H____=,the court in P.C. denied a § 504 claim because\nplaintiff could not prove that he was denied benefits \"solel_\nbecause of handicap,\" a requirement that does notexist in the ADA.\nFinally, the P.C. court also based its holding on the \"fundamental\ndeficiency\" in plaintiffs' position that there was no evidence of\n\"discriminatory animus\" even though the Supreme Court had already\nheld five years earlier that § 504 does not require proof of\nintentional discrimination. See Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287,\n296-97, 105 S. Ct. 712, 718, 83 L.Ed.2d 712 (1985).\nPhillips v. Thompson, 715 F.2d. 365 (7th Cir. 1983) is an\nolder § 504 case and did not involve the ADA or the integration\nregulation. The plaintiffs in that case argued that the state had\nan affirmative duty to create services. I_dd. at 368. Here, by\ncontrast, plaintiffs argued only for the provision of existinq\n43\n\nservices for which they qualify and for which no modifications are\nnecessary. Finally, the\nPhillips court relied principally on\nSoutheastern Community Colleqe v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397, 99 S. Ct.\n2369, 60 L.Ed.2d 980 (1979), a decision rejected by the Congress in\npassing the ADA. 18\nAnother case relied upon by defendants, Jackson v. Ft. Stanton\nHosp. and Traininq Sch., 757 F. Supp. 1243 (D.N.M. 1990), aff'd in\npart, rev'd in part on other qrounds, 964 F.2d. 980 (10th Cir.\n1992), actually required the integration of persons with severe\ndisabilities into community programs under § 504. The case did not\nconsider in any way the integration regulation at issue here.\nPerhaps most amazingly, defendants rely upon Clark v. Cohen,\n794 F.2d. 79 (3rd Cir. 1986), the Third Circuit case decided prior\nto Helen L. and expressly distinguished by Helen L. As noted in\nHelen L., Clark was a § 504 case that had nothing to do with the\nADA or the integration regulation. Helen L., 46 F.3d. at 333-34.\nInstead, the plaintiffs in Clark relied upon § 504 regulations that\nrequired a comparison between the disabled and the non-disabled.\nI_dd. Thus, Clark involved a completely different regulation with a\ncompletely different standard. Moreover, the Third Circuit in\nClark barely discussed the § 504 claim relegating it to a footnote\nand affirming the lower court's decision on the § 504 claim under\nthe clearly erroneous standard. Clar____k,794 F.2d at 84-85, n. 3.\n18In Davi_____sst,he Supreme Court held that no affirmative duty existed\nto accommodate persons with disabilities. 442 U.S. at 411-13, 99\nS. Ct. at 2369-71. As a result, Congress made clear in the ADA\nthat accommodation is required. See 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2); see also\n28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7).\n44\n\nThe Third Circuit's construction of its own caselaw in its own\ncircuit should be respected by this court.\nDefendants cite only two cases in their favor that had\nanything to do with the ADA and the integration regulation.\nNeither of those two cases had the benefit of the Attorney\nGeneral's interpretation\nof its own integration regulation, and\nboth were decided before Helen L.\nThe first case, Williams v. Secretary of the Executive Office,\n609 N.E.2d 447 (Mass. 1993), relied almost exclusively on Clark v.\nCohen, a § 504 decision rejected by Helen L. under the ADA. Helen\nL__.also rejected Williams. 46 F.3d at 333-34.\nPerhaps more importantly, the plaintiffs in Williams presented\nno evidence \"that any particular client's placement was\ninappropriate, or that they themselves were inappropriately placed\nin a segregated setting .... \" Williams, 609 N.E.2d at 453.\nInstead, plaintiffs relied upon a global statistical analysis that\ndisabled persons in general were more likely to be adversely\naffected by the state's policy than non-disabled persons. Id.\nAlso, the state in Williams had not undertaken to provide any\nservices to the plaintiffs who were homeless persons.\nBy contrast, in this case, the state already was providing\nservices to these plaintiffs, albeit segregated services. Second,\nunlike Williams, defendants have admitted that these individual\nplaintiffs qualify for integrated services in the community. To\nthe extent that Williams requires differences in treatment of the\ndisabled compared to the non-disabled, it isnon-sensical because,\nas noted in Helen L., only the disabled are institutionalized.\nThe second case, Conner v. Branstad, 839 F. Supp. 1346 (S.D.\n45\n\nIowa 1993), relied upon § 504 caselaw that had nothing to do with\nthe ADA or the integration regulation. Second, Conner involved a\nclaim that the state has an affirmative duty to create integrated\nservices, a claim not made in this case. I_dd. at 1356, 1358.\nThird, Conner was a class action alleging that § 504 and the ADA\nmandate deinstitutionalization. I_dd. at 1356-57. This case, by\ncontrast, involves two individual plaintiffs who merely allege that\nunder their individual facts, the services being provided to them\ncan be provided appropriately in a more integrated setting.\nFourth, even the Conner court accepted the notion that the ADA\napplies to discrimination based on the severity of one's\ndisability. I_dd. at 1358, n. 20. The Conner Plaintiffs did not\nassert this claim as plaintiffs do here. As already shown, even\nassuming the ADA imposes such a requirement, plaintiffs meet it in\nthis case. Last, Conner is unpersuasive because it contains no\nanalysis of the ADA integration regulation, the Attorney General's\ninterpretation of that regulation, or the deference that is owed to\nthe Attorney General's interpretation.\nIV. THE DEFENSE OF LACK OF FUNDING IS FACTUALLY AND LEGALLY\nINSUPPORTABLE IN THIS CASE.\nDefendants have argued from the outset that they refused to\nprovide integrated services to plaintiffs due to lack of funds and\nthat lack of funds is a defense to an ADA violation. This argument\nis factually and legally insupportable.\nFirst, as a factual matter, defendants' argument is belied\nentirely by the provision of integrated services to L.C. shortly\nafter this case was filed, by •the more recent provlsion of\nintegrated services to E.W., and as the district court noted, by\n46\n\nthe undisputed evidence which establishes that the average cost for\nproviding integrated services is less than one-half the cost of\nproviding segregated services.\nSecond, the undisputed evidence shows that available\nintegrated services existed for months prior to defendants actually\nproviding those services to plaintiffs. Defendants admitted in\ndepositions that they were using only 700 out of 2100 medicaid\nwaiver slots that were available for providing integrated services.\nAnd as recently as February 1997, HCFA cited the defendants for\nmoving only 237 persons from institutions into the community rather\nthan 1,000 persons (200 per year) from 1992 - 1996, as required by\ndefendants' HCFA-approved state plan. R8-79-Exh. ii at pp. 2-4.\nThird, to the extent that some costs may be imposed in\nproviding integrated services, the ADA requires it. Congress was\nclear when it passed the ADA that it expected compliance costs to\nbe substantial but that such costs were not a defense:\nThe fact that it is more convenient, either\nadministratively or fiscally, to provide services in a\nsegregated manner, does not constitute a valid\njustification for separate or different services under\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, or under this\ntitle [title II] .... [T]he existence of such programs can\nnever be used as a basis to exclude a person with a\ndisability from a program that is offered to persons\nwithout disabilities, or to refuse to provide an\naccommodation in a reqular settinq.\nH.R. Rep. No. 485(II) at 50, reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 473. 19\n19Given the existence of integrated services and funds for those\nservices, Plaintiffs do not believe that any modification of\ndefendants' programs or services is required in order to comply\nwith the ADA in this case. To the extent, however, that reasonable\nmodifications are necessary, the implementing regulations require\n47\n\nSenator Hatch acknowledged that integration would:\nimpose a lot of expenses and rightly so. It is time we\ndid these things. It is time we brought persons with\ndisabilities into full freedom, economic and otherwise,\nwith other citizens in our society. This bill will do\nthat. In doing so, we should be aware that it is going\nto be\ncostly and difficult and that there will be some\ncomplaints.\n135 Cong. Rec. 19835 (1989). Senator Harkin echoed this sentiment:\n[F]ocusing on the costs of compliance by covered entities\nwas totally inappropriate given the economic benefits to\nsociety of reducing the deficit by getting people off of\nwelfare, out of institutions, and on to the tax rolls.\n135 Cong. Rec. 8508 (1989) (emphasis added).\nOn the other hand, Congress strongly believed that\ndiscrimination had its own costs. As stated in the Congressional\nfindings incorporated into the ADA:\nthe continuing existence of unfair and unnecessary\ndiscrimination and prejudice denies people with\ndisabilities the opportunity to compete on an equal basis\nand to pursue those opportunities for which our free\nsociety is justifiably famous, and costs the United\nStates billions of dollars in unnecessary expenses\nresulting from dependency and non-productivity.\n42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(9) (emphasis added).\nThe courts have construed the ADA in accordance with the\nCongressional intent. Helen L., 46 F.3d at 338-39; Concerned\nParents to Save Dreher Park Center v. City of West Palm Beach, 846\nF. Supp. 986, 993 (S.D. Fla. 1994); Kroll v. St. Charles County,\nsuch modifications so long as they do not fundamentally alter the\nnature of the programs or services. 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7).\nPlaintiffs have not demanded any fundamental alterations, and in a\nsimilar context other courts have ruled that no fundamental\nalterations were required.

PLAINTIFFS ARE ENTITLED TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON THEIR\nFOURTEENTH AMENDMENT CLAIM\nPlaintiffs believe that they are entitled to summary judgment\non their Fourteenth Amendment claim principally because the\nundisputed evidence from the qualified professionals establishes\nthat plaintiffs' treatment and habilitation at GRH-A was not\nminimally adequate. Elliott II dep., p. 66, I. 19 - p. 73, i. 14;\nR5-59-Exh. 14 at p. 4; R5-59-Exh. 8 at ¶¶ 19, 21, 39-40; R5-59-Exh.\n9 at ¶¶ 8-11; Elliott I dep., 96, i. 4-21.\nPlaintiffs agree that Younqberq v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S.\nCt. 2452 (1982) requires courts to defer to qualified professional\njudgment. The undisputed facts in this case, however, show that\nthe professionals upon whom the defendants rely never exercised\nqualified professional judgment because they had no mental\nretardation qualifications. Patel I dep., p. 36, I. 17-24; p. 37.,\ni. 6-9; Amin dep., p. 18, i. 23-25; p. 28, i. 18-21; Thornton dep.,\np. 35, i. 4-7; Bliss dep., p. 38, i. 24 - p. 39, i. 2; Parrish\ndep., p. 15, i. 3-23.

They\nalso admitted that their decisions to keep these plaintiffs at GRH-\nA were not motivated by medical judgment (appropriate under\nYounqberq) but by their uninformed belief that no other\nalternatives existed (inappropriate under Youngberg; see also\nJackson v. Ft. Stanton, 757 F. Supp. at 1312). SMF 42, 66, 68-71,\n73, 152, 154, 159-162. In fact, the mental retardation waiver\nprogram that the professionals had contended could not be used for\ncommunity services was ultimately used for these plaintiffs. SMF\n159-61, 132.\nSuffice it to say that the parties extensively briefed the\nFourteenth Amendment issue in the district court, but that court\ndenied the claim as moot. If this Court believes that this issue\nshould be considered, it should remand it to the district court for\nits consideration in the first instance. See Youakim v. Miller,\n425 U.S., 231, 234, 96 S.

Because the state proposes to use a Prepaid Health Plan to be the sole provider of menlo[\n• health services under this waiver program, we have been advised by legal counsel that the\nState needs a waiver of the regulations at 42 CFR 434.25(a)(2) regarding to[unto D\"\nenrollment. HCFA will provide such a waiver should the State's application be\napproved.\nMvdicarc Dunl Elieibles\n2. As explained in the March 18, 1996. letter to Randy' Poulscn from Beth Sullivan, IICFA\npolicy' precludes States from holding Medicare duai eligibles responsible for coinsurance\nor deductibles in c_es where a beneficiary chooses to use out-of-network providers for\nMedicare covered services. [n section 313.1 of the draft RFP submitted with the State's\nwaiver application, the State continues to say that the MCO will be required to educate\nMedicare dual eligibles to their copayment responsibilities and collect these payments\nfrom them. This 1915(b) waiver application will not bc approved if Medicare dual\neligibles are made to pay cost sharing. Section 31.3.] and the referenced section\nregarding the MCO's filing of Medicare claims (Section 3g6--not yet v,'riuen) will need\nto bc rewritten to reflect the prohibition of Medicare beneficiaries' cost sharing. The R.FP\nwill also need to reflect the need for coordination of care between the MCO and out-of-\nnetwork providers who serve Medicase dual eligibles.\nCivil Righ_,s\n3. As explained below, HCFA cannot approve this 19t5(by waivcr as long as it contains the\ncurrent proposal to require the MCO to purchase a set number of bed days from the\nMontana State Hospital or the Montana Mental Health Nursing Care Center. Such\nfinancial arrangements would violate the Am,-ricans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Even\nif the,v applied to all Medicaid beneficiaries, these arrangements would draw into\nquestion the clinical necessity of any MCO placements in these facilities. Given that\ncurrent admission criteria do not appear to prevent placements to these facilities of\npersons requiring only community-based care, the State's continuance ofthese admission\ncriteria under the waiver would not provide an adequate protection against the incentive\nposed by !he bed duys requirement.\nUnder the ,'_DA and regulations written at 2g CFR 130(d), a State must not ptacc or keep\nin an institutional facility any person who could be served more appropriately in a\ncummunity-based setting. The State is further obligated to create the community-based\nservices to serve these individuals. The court cases ofHeten L. Vs. DiDario (1995) and\nCharles Q. Vs. Houston (April 1996) have dete.'-mined that a State's argument that no\ncnmmunlty-h_sed services currently exist is not a p_:-missiblc argument for keeping\nindividuals in institutional settings when the} would more appropriately' bc treated in a\ncommunity setting,\n\nPage 2\nA central tenet of Montana's 1915(b) waive: proposal isto use a managed care\norganization (MCO) in order to achieve efficiencies and voluntary investments from the\nentity which can hc used to develop community-ba_d alternatives for care. This goal is\nin line withthe requirements of the ADA. However, the State's proposal to require the\nMCO In purchase a set number of bed days from Momaaa State Hospital and the\nMontana Mental Health Nursing Care Center puts the State in a position to violate the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act. By requiring the MCO to purchase a set number of bed\ndays from institutional providers, the MCO is incented to place or keep individuals in\nthese facilities regardless of the medical necessity for in.stitutionai level care.\nHCFA raised this issue in Beth Sullivan's loner to Randy Poulsen dated May 7, 1996. In\na response letter from Mr. Poulsen dated May 22, Montana argued that.the admission\ncriteria currently used by these facilities would be the same admission criteria used under\nthe proposed waiver program. This criteria, it was implied, only permit persons to be\nadmitted to these institudons if institutional level care is required for their proper\ntreatment. Therefore, the State argued, the admission criteria offer protection against the\nfinancial incentive given to th_ MCO toward institutionalization of en.rollees. The State's\nargument fails toacknowledge the fac'xthat, given the chronic nature of severe mental\nillness, plans to r_duee bed occupancy in the State Hospital by nearly half amount to an\nadmission that nearly half of those persons currently served at an institutional level of\ncare could be served by commurfi_-based alternatives. The State cannot reasonably\nargue that nearly half of those currently served by ,..heHospital will either die, move out\nof the State, or experience a spontaneous remission from severe mental illness in the nex.t\nfew years. Therefore, the admission criteria currently used by both the Montana State\nHospital and the Mental Health Nursing Care Center does not provide any protection\nagainst the financial incentive of the required bed days purchase by the MCO.\nThe State fi.u\"th_ argued that therequired bed day purchase would be substantially less\nthan the current occupancy rate for these facilities and, therefore, could not effecr.iveiy\nineent the MCO toward inappropriate institutionalization ofen.rollees. These proposed\nfinancial arrangements, regardless of the percentage of current bed days represented by\nthe required bed day purchase, would still taint any placement decision made by 'the\nMCO. Until the purchased bed days were accounted for with actual placements, the\nMCO would be calculating both the clinical as well as financial benefit to be achieved\nfrom an institutional Vs communiD'-based placement of each individual. Access to\nquality care would be brought into question for any Medicaid beneficiary, whose\nplacement decisions were affected by such financial incentives. But the ADA specifically\nprohibits disabled persons from having \"their treatment decisions affected in tkis way\nwhen other providers serving the Medicaid population would not face such incentives.\nHCFA cannot approve this waiver as long as the required bed day purchase provision\nremains a part of the waiver proposal.\nF_scal Issues/Cost-E ffectivencsn\n\nPage 3\nIn Beth Sullivan's May 7. 1996, letter to Randy Poulsen, it was noted '_hatfederal\n.-t.\nmatching funds were available for debt service related to Montana State Hospital\nrenovations in accordance with regulations at 42 CFR 413.130. In the State's May\nresponse to Ms. Sullivan. it was said that federal funds would not be used to retire the\nrenovation debt. instead, a portion of money paid to the MCO from State general fi.mds\nwould be required to be deposited into a special account pledged to debt service.\nIt is HCFA's understanding that State legislation (House Bill 594) and proposals made to\nthe Montana Health Facility Authority suggest 'that federal money will be among the\nrevenues used to finance the Hospital's renovation. Despite the contradiction between\nthe State's communications with HCFA and its proposals within the State of Momana,\nHCFA would like to reiterate that federal matching fi.mds are available for these debt\nservice costs. We are troubled by the State's proposal that a pornon of funds normally\nallocated to patient care be used to retire the debt. We also understand that the State's\nprote_ion and advocacy program. Montana Advocacy Program (MAP) Inc., is prepared\nto file a complaint with the U.S. District Court over this bonding issue. In addition to\nsharing HCFA's concerns over potential civil fights violations, N1AP also contends that\nthe State proposes to use federal funds received for care at the Montana ,Mental Health\nNursing Care Center to help retire the bond at the State Hospital. While HCFA has no\nauthority to prevent a State's intergovemmental transfer of funds, we would reraind the\nState of HCFA's authority to apply intermediate s_mctions or to terminate _e waiver\nprogram should serious quality of care issues arise at either facility as the result of the\nredirection of patient care dollars to the retirement of debt.\nWe encourage the State to reconsider the means by which it intends to retire the State\nHospita! bond. We believe federal dollars should be used to assist Montana in meeting •\nits bond retirement obligation while not endangering the quality of patient care.\nAppropriate debt service costs can be included in the Medicaid capitation rate paid to the\nMCO. These costs would be in addition to the expected patient care costs normally\nfigured into an acmarially sound rate. The portion of the total debt service matchable by\nfederal Medicaid dollars is equal to the portion of Montana State Hospital's costs which\nare attributable to patients whose services are Medicaid matchable. (This would appear\nto be residents in the Hospital's Long Term Care Unit who are either under 21 or over 64\nyears of age.) In order to again this federal match for debt service, please provide HCFA\nwith details demonstrating the portion of Momana State Hospital's costs anributable to\nMedicaid matchable patients.\nOn pages 5-7 of Appendix C.I, trend rates used for the calculation of the UPL are\ndetailed. Please explain how these trend rat_s were used to get the cumulative trends in\nAuachrnent II, step 4. How do the rates described on pages 5-7 compare to the UPL rates\nused in Appendix C.27\nOn page 6 of the waiver aoplication the State notes it will enroll all Medicaid\n\nPage 4\nbeneficiaries intothe waiver program and projects total unduplicated enrollment in year\ntwo of the waiver to be 142,400 individuals. However, the State uses very. different\neligibility numbers in its cost effectiveness section of the application. Here, capitation\nrmes are based on average numbers ofeligibtes ranging from approximately 77-79.000\nindividuals, depending on whether the data is for the SFY95 base year or one of the two\nwaiver years. Please expiain.\nThroughout the State's cost effectiveness section, \"'Other Institutional\" costs and ensuing\ncapitation rates are included in rate cells for 45-,- SSI and under 65 age dual eligible\nbeneliciaries. Please demonstrate that the Lewin analysis selected out claims for\nresidential treatment centers with more than 16 beds as well as any claims from Montana\nState Hospital or the Montana Mental Health Nursing Care Center which are attributable\nm individuals aged 21-64 whose costs cannot be federally matched while in institutions\nfor the mentally disabled.\nArc disproportionate share hospital costs included in the UPL for inpatient costs? If so,\npleas= explain how the State plans to pay out DSH funds under the waiver.\n9. The State's cost effectiveness calculations will need to r=flect 'the fact that cost sharing\nfor Medicare dual eligibles will need to be paid by the State (or by the MCO, if the State\nwishes to incorporate cost sharing into the capitation rate) for any beneficiaries choosing\ntu go out-of-network for Medicare covered services. Should the State decide nat to\ncapitatc the MC..O for cost-sharing expenses, the waiver application at sections C.].c. and\nC.6.d.I. and h. 1. will need to be modified to account for these fee-for-service costs.\nI(l. On page 6 of the waiver application, the State notes that the medically needy population\nwill be included under the waiver program. Yet throughout the cost effectiveness\ncalculations, no data reflect costs or trends related to the medically need)'. Are these\nindividuals somehow folded into the AEDC, SSI or Medicare dual eligible data? Please\nctarify.\nIt. In sectinns C.6.d. and h.. the State has added in costs for \"QA Contractor\" and\n\"'Consulting\" under an \"Other Costs\" category. Please explain what is meant by QA\nContractor. What would be done under a QA contract that is not currently being done\nwithout the waiver? Are QA costs included somewhere in the \"'without waiver\" side of\nthe cost effectiveness calculations? This may be an allowable administrative expense, but\nwe cannot be sure of this without further information from the State. Regarding the\n\"'Consulting\" costs, HCFA does not match consulting costs related to development of\nwaiver programs. These State costs should not be included in the cost effectiveness\ncalculatinn for the waiver.\nPage 4 of.Appendix C.I. notes that baseline data were adjusted for SFY1994-95\noverpayments totaling $316,528 made to one large mental hearth provider. HCFA\n\nPage5\nassumes this is Mental Health Ser,,ices Inc. of Helena which is undergoing a federal\nwhistle blower investigation. The State should note that its UPL calculation and ensuing\ncapitation rates may need to be adjusted at a later time should the fedora./investigation\nreveal overpayments grossly in excess of the State's estimate of overpayments.\ni3, The State will need to submit repia\"_'ment pages for any pages of the waiver to which\nchanges are made, as the result of Lhese questions and comments.

It is unclear from the list of representatives mentioned on page 2 of the waiver whether\nthe State Mental Health PlarmJng \"_ndAdviso W Council took part in the development of\nthe MHAP. Did the Planning Couw'il determine that the MHAP was consistent with the\nState Plan as reviewed by the CouneiI? As this is a waiver for memal health services and\nthe Planning Council ismandated to review the State's mental health plan prior to review\nor award oft.he CMHS Block Grant, these questions require a response before CM/-IS\ndollars can be used under the waiver. A letter from the State Mental Health Plan.rAng\nCouncil with their comments on the waiver proposal needs to be submitted by the State.\nt5. RFP Section 333.8 notes that the Mental Health Plm\",..ningand Advisor)\" Council will\nreview the annual Block Grant Plan prepared by Momana's DPHHS. What will the\nrelationship of the Planning Council be to the MCO ,under the MI-IAP waiver? How w'ill\nthe development of the State Plan and application for the CMHS Block Grant be linked to\nthe MHAP and the MCO?\n16. The State's approved CMHS Block Grant Plan contains information for Services to SED\nchildren which include, bu'_are no_ 1L'T,[tedto, Sex Offender Evaluation, W'mpa.round\nSee'ices, Therapeutic Aides, Sex Offender Treatmem, Chemical Dependency Treatment.\nThese are services which are not expressly noted in the waiver or tLFP Section 3.;2.

C_c Ma.nag_.'_nen: specifies that th._ Service Plan must delineate any\nqqifferenees in type or level ofc_e management and the criteria to be used in determining\nwho \".rill receive these services. Ctu,rently, the CMHS Block Grant Plan from the State\nincludes he objective \"Maintain case management services for all CMHC clients with a\nsevere and disabling mental illness at or above FY 95 levels.\" The State now has both\nintensive and supportive c_e management services.

On page 9 of the waiver, the State affirms its commitment to an orderly transition to the\n, MHAP program. HCFA strongly urges the State to plan for a phased-in transition to\nMHAP in order to protect the quality and continuity of treatment for persons already\nreceiving mental health services under the Passport to Health and HMO programs.\nWc remind the State that it will need to modify its Passport to Health 1915(b) waiver and\namend its \"Families Achieving Independence in :Montana\" 1! 15waiver to reflect the\ncarve out of mental he'qth services and costs from these waiver pro_ams.\n!9. Page 14. item d, the waiver request states that the MCO will be required to include all\nMontana FQHCs which currently provide mental health services in their provider\nnetwork. However: the state has modified the language in its RFP at section 342.1\n(Existing Provider Army) and the revision does not make this intent clear. The previous\nRFP stated that, \"'The State will not require that the MCO include in its network all\nproviders of a specified category, except FQHCs.\" In the new RFP, the exceouon for\nFQHCs has been removed. The waiver language is very. clear that the MCO must\ncontract with al! FQHCs that cun:ently provide mental health services; the RFP no longer\ngives the same impression. We recommend that the State's choice of whether the MCO\nmust contrac: with all FQHC mental health providers or only those needed to assure\naccess be clearly stated in both the ,.,.ziver application and the RFP.\nIn addition, by' limiting the requirement at section 342.1 to FQHCs that \"eun-endy\nprovide mental health services, ='certain providers (such as many urban Indian clinics who\nhave nm yet developed mental health ser-.'ices) are potentially excluded from\nparticipation for the life of the contract. Unless this is what the State intended, we\nrecommend the State remove the word \"cun-,ently\" to simply note that FQHCs providing\nmental healuh services are part of the existing provider array.\n20. In Appendix C.1,page 8, a statement is made that there are only 3 mid-level practiuoners\nin the State. The State Plan Amendmen_ for Montana shows many mid-!oval\npractitioners inthe State.

By\nmeasuring and a_ing upon deficiencies in areas such as waiting times for crisis, urgent,\nand non-urgent visits, States and HCFA may demonstrate to managed care skeptics that\naccess can actually be broadened under waiver programs. However. in order to know\nwhether access is likely to be equal to or beuer than the current Medicaid program,\nbaseline information is needed.

In addition we ask your reference to all materials previously sent to your\noffices, and to the offices of Nancy Goetschius.\n1. The plan discriminates against persons institutionalized at the Montana State Hospital\n(MSH) and the Montana Mental Health Nursing Care Center (NfiMIqNCC) in violation of Title II\nof the American's With Disabilities Act (ADA). Pursuant to Sections 333.6, 333.7, 346 and 347\nof the state's Request for Proposal (RFP) these persons are not to be accorded the rights of other\nperson's under the plan, nor are they to be accorded the rights afforded them under the ADA.\nThe ADA requires that a state not discriminate against qualified persons with a disability in the\nprovision of services. 42 USC 12132. Services provided by the state, including mental health\ntreatment services, are required by regulations written by the Department 0f Justice to be\nprovided in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of the individual. 28 CFR 35.130\n(d). Recently, this requirement has been interpreted by case law to mean that persons who can be\ntreated in the community, must be treated in the community. See: _ and\nCharles O v Houstoun.\nMontana proposes that funding for treatment services at MSH and MMMNCC may not be\ndiscontinued by the Managed Care Organization (MCO). Every other person in the system, and\nmedicaid itself, will be protected from unnecessary or inappropriate medical treatment services by\nthe oversight of the MCO, except these individuals who are institutionalized. The state suggests\nthat these persons are involuntarily committed, and that is the reason this disparate treatment is\nnecessary. They do not inform you however, that persons in the state are involuntarily committed\nto institutions other than MSH or MMHNCC, including community commitments. It is only the\nplacement of persons at state institutions that distinguishes them from others.\nMissoula Office: 415 N. I-'Liggins. Suite 2. Missoula.

(406) 693-7035\nE-Mail: advocate@lewis.MT.net\n\nBeth Sullivan\nJune 14, 1996\nPage 2\nThe state, as you \"know, is planning to rebuild MSH. They plan to have bonds issued by a the\nMontana Health Facility Authority 0vfl-IZFA), borrow from these proceeds, and pay the cost of\nservicing this loan by pledging revenues generated from MSH and _CC. This plan will\ninvariably require the institutionalization of patients that could be served in the community.\nPatients must be confined at these institutions in order to generate the revenues that will pay the\ncost of the debt service, Without an adequate patient base, the project will fail.\nThe st_ite has written into its RFP a number of insurance clauses, guaranteeing that funds will be\navailable for paying this debt service. The MCO will be required to purchase a certain number of\nbed-days, regardless of medical necessity, from MSH and _CC. Sections 346 & 347. KF'P.\nThe MCO will not be able to decertify funding of unnecessary services at MSH or _.fiMHNCC,\nalthough it may do so anywhere else in the system. Sections 333.6&333_7. RFP. The MCO will\nbe required to pay an amount equal to the cost of debt service on the reconstruction project,\nregardless of patient needs or hospital utilization, to the state every quarter to guarantee payment\nof the reconstruction project. _e_:tion 346. RFP.\nAll of the above will create powerful incentives for continuing the institutional care of patients.\nThe MCO will be paying for bed-days regardless of need, thereby taking money from community\nservices. There will consequently be less money available for community services, and the MCO\nwill be required to utilize the institutions lest they pay twice for patient services. Having\ncommitted so many resources to a new state hospital, the state will be required to use it in order\nto justify, the expenditure, and the expenditure requires that patients be confined at these\ninstitutions.\nIt is necessaq,' to point out that the state has not requested a wavier of the IMD rule. That means\nthat a substantial portion of revenues generated by these institutions will be from charges for\npersons over the age of 64 (the predominant population at MMJ-hNCC) and Native Americans\nthrough the Indian Health Service contract. They, more than the general population of patients\nwill be impacted by the needs of the state to fund debt service. Thus age and ethnicity will bring\nwith it a risk of confinement even greater than for other patients. This is, arguably, discriminatory\nas a maner.oflaw.\nThe state has suggested that the involuntary commitment statute will protect these Patients from\nneedless institutionalization. By reference to the Charles O, case, and the transcripts of\ncommitment hearing previously sent you, this is obviously not true. People are institutionalized in\nMontana because there is no place for them to go. I enclose a letter, dated June I0, 1996, from\nMSH Unit Supervisor Dave Sturm, (Attached hereto as _ and fully incorporated by\nreference). The letter clearly states that a substantial number of patients could be treated in the\ncommunity, if services were available. As they are not, the patients are involuntarily recommitted.\nThis illustrates conclusively, that people are not only committed on the basis of mental illness, but\nalso on the basis of available treatment alternatives.\n\nBethSullivan\nJune14,1996\nPage3\nThestatehasillegallyfailedtoprovidecommunityservicestopatientswithinitsinstitutionsin\nv_01atioonftherequirementthatservicesbeprovidedinthemost integrated setting appropriate to\nthe needs ofthe qualified individuals with disabilities. 42 USC 12132 and 28 CFR 35.130 (d).\nThe state has failed to modify its programs to provide community services in violation of the\nrequirement of law that reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures are required\nwhen the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability. 28 CFR\n35. 130 (b)(7).\nThe state intends to treat institutionalized patients differently than any other persons under the\nRFP and MTMHAP in violation of the requirement that the state not provide different or separate\nservices to an individual unless such action is \"necessary\" to provide services that are as effective\nas those provided to others. 28 CFR 35. 130 (b)(1)(iv).\nThe state, \"knowing that institutional treatment services are not as effective as community\ntreatment services for treatment of the mentally ill, refuses to provide community treatment,\nthereby violating the provisions of law that prohibit a state, on the basis of a disability, from\nproviding a qualified individual with a service that is not as effective as that provided to others.\n28 CFR 35.130 (b)(1)(iii).\nThe state is asking HCFA to approve a system that will have at its core powerful incentives to\ninstitutionalize persons with disabilities. Such a system would be violative of the ADA, and the\nDepartment of Justice's interpretive regulations. The proposed ivh-MHAP perpetuates violations\nof law, and in fact creates new violations. It must not be approved.\n2. The state is proposing to rebuild its state hospital by pledging revenues generated at the\nNe,dHNCC and MSH to pay the cost of reconstruction. I have previously sent you a copy of the\nenabling legislation indicating this is the plan. Pledging revenues from the NDdTHNCC to payment\nof reconstruction of MSHis violative of 42 CFR4132.130.\n3. Requiring the MCO to pay sums equivaient to the amount needed to pay the cost of debt\nservice for the reconstructing of MSI-_ Section 346. RFP, is an illegal provider ta.,q prohibited by\n42 USC 1396 (w)(1)(A)(ii). This is a kick-back scheme. The state may argue that they will only\nutilize state funds for this debt. However, reference to the enabling legislation indicates pledging\nof all revenues. Further, all moneys will be put into a common pool under the proposed system.\nThe claim that state moneys can be segregated from the common pools is sophistry. The federal\ngovernment will be providing funds that will be covering expenditures under the system, the state\nwill simply allocate those federal dollars to programs the state would otherwise fund. It will be\nthose federal dollars that fund this scheme.\n\nBeth Sullivan\nlune 14, 1996\nPage 4\n4. The MMHAP is largely silent as to the gri-,vance process. It suggests that a process will\nbe'developed by the MCO without clear elaboration as to standards or protocol. Section IV A_\n_. In addition, the process does not contain a commitment to allowing medicaid recipients\nto continue to receive services during the pendency of an appeal of a denial of services, as\nrequired under Goldber_ v Kelly. The state has publicly, during its public hearing process,\nannounced it will not mandate the rights afforded by _ to be implemented under the\nMMHAP.\n5. The MMHAP is largely silent as to how monitoring of access and quality will take place.\nSection IV B. MMHAP. The state asserts that it will \"rely upon consumer and advocacy groups\nas 'early warning' mechanisms in monitoring adequacy of services\". This is inadequate, entirely\nanecdotal, and lacking in validity. There exists no baseline of services to measure if there is a\ndecline in services. The number and success of consumer complaints cannot be the Roseta stone\nof quality control.\n6. The cost effectiveness of the program is based almost entirely on the 5% reduction in\nbudget under the system. Section IV. C. MMHAP. This type of savings is illusory. Of course\nthere will be less spent, if less is budgeted.\n7. The MMHAP will diminish the level of services provided int Montana. The reasons are\nthat the following cost will be added to the system, with a 5% reduction in budget to pay for\nthem:\nMCO cost of administration;\na.\nb. Capital cost of MSH reconstruction;\nC. Requirement that the MCO provide chemical dependency treatment to\ndually diagnosed patients without addition funding;\nd. An expanded eligibility group to 200% of Federal Poverty Level; and\ne. The cost of developing a system to measure outcomes, as required to assure\ncompliance with the contract and HCFA requirements.\n8. • The NfMH_kP, Section 330. RFP, will require the MCO to rely upon existing Montana\nproviders for the \"preponderance\" ofall services provided under the MMHAP. This is, arguably,\nin violation of the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, federal statutes and\nre_tations, and Montana's own Unfair Trade Practice Act. Section 30-14-101, et seq.\n9. The state has provided interested paroles with it's MMHAP and R.FP, however at\nnumerous places within the RFP reference is made to \"Attachments\" that are not provided. As a\nresult, these comments are limited by that omission.\n\nBethSullivan\nJune14,1996\nPage5\n10.

Our treatment team on the Xanthopoulos Treatment Facility often\ndiscuss the fact that if more group homes were available, we would be recommending\nmore patients for discharge.\nWhile I don't have precise facts as to how many patients might be referred, I can tell you\nthere would be a significant number. This, of course, would be tempered by what type of\ngroup homes were available. Some of our patients need more structure than others and\nsome have special needs; i.e., polydipsia patients.\nThe support for more community group homes is not universally shared by mental health\nprofessionals, but if the goal is to reduce the census of Montana State Hospital, I don't\nsee another way.\nDave Sturm, Unit Supervisor\nXanthopoulos Treatment Facility\nDS/Ir\nI\nEXHIBIT A\n\nINDEX\nTab 1 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq., including §§ 12132-12134\nTab 2 Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29\nU.S.C. § 794\nTab 3 28 C.F.R. part 35, including § 35.130(d)\nTab 4 28 C.F.R. part 35, App. A, § 35.130\nTab 5 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(d)\nTab 6 45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b) and (b (2)\nTab 7 O.C.G.A. § 37-2-5.1(c)(3)\n\nPage 1099 TITLE 42--THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELFARE §12101\nPART B--ACTIONS A2PLICABLE TO P_BLIC TBANSPORTA- S@¢.\nTION PROVIDED BY PUBLIC ENTITIES CONSIDERED (d) Deadline.\nDISCRIMINATORY (el Review.\n12186.

At any time\nduring the tenure of the executive director, the regional board may for\ngood cause vote to request the removal of the executive director. Should\nsuch a vote for removal be taken and be approved by a majority of the full\nboard membership, the board shall submit its request to the director of the\ndivision who shall in turn comply with the request of the board. The\ndirector of the division shall be authorized to appoint for a period not to\nexceed 12 months an interim executive director at an)' time that the\nposition of executive director is vacant and prior to the appointment of a\nduly qualified and approved successor.\n(b) The executive director of the regional board may\"appoint such other\nstaffand personnel to work for the unit as that executive director and board\ndeem necessary and appropriate. The executive director and such staffand\npersonnel shall be employees of the division. Expenses for the regional\nboard, the employment of the executive director, other staff and personnel,\nand the operation of the unit office shall be charged against the funding\nallocated to the regional board for planning and service delivery within the\nestablished region. The department and the division may impose limits on\nthe administrative and operating expenditures of the regional board and\nthe unit.\n(c) (1) State, federal, mad other funds appropriated to the department,\nthe division, or both, and available for the purpose of funding the\nplanning and delivery of disability services shall be distributed in\naccordance with this subsection. After July 1, 1995, all funds associated\nwith services to clients residing within a given region shall be allocated\nthrough the appropriate regional board; \"all funds\" shall include\nfunding for hospitals, community service boards, private and public\ncontracts, and any contracts relating to service delivery for clients within\nthe given region; provided, however, that nothing shall prohibit the\nallocation of funds through any regional board prior to July 1, 1995. The\ndivision shall establish a minimum funding amount for regional boards\nconditioned upon the amount of funds appropriated and a supplemental\nfunding formula to be used for the distribution of available state funds in\nexcess of the minimum funding amount.

L. C., BY JONATHAN ZIMRING,\nGUARDIAN AD LITEM AND NEXT FRIEND, ET AL.\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\nAPPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n[June 22, 1999]\nJUSTICE  GINSBURG  announced the judgment of the\nCourt and  delivered the opinion of the Court with respect\nto Parts I, II, and III–A, and an opinion with respect to\nPart III–B, in which O’CONNOR, SOUTER, and BREYER, JJ.,\njoined.\nThis case concerns the proper construction of the anti-\ndiscrimination provision contained in the public services\nportion (Title II) of the Americans with Disabilities Act of\n1990, 104 Stat. 337, 42 U.  S. C. §12132.  Specifically, we\nconfront  the question whether the proscription of di s-\ncrimination may require placement of persons with mental\ndisabilities in community settings rather than in instit u-\ntions.  The answer, we hold, is a qualified yes.  Such action\nis in order when the State ’s treatment professionals have\ndetermined that community placement is appropriate, the\ntransfer from institutional care to a less restrictive setting\nis not opposed by the affected individual, and the plac e-\nment  can be reasonably accommodated, taking into a c-\ncount the resources available to the State and the needs of\nothers with mental disabilities.  In so ruling, we affirm the\n\n2 OLMSTEAD v. L. C.\nOpinion of the Court\ndecision of the Eleventh Circuit in substantial part.  We\nremand the case, however, for further consideration of the\nappropriate relief, given the range of facilities the State\nmaintains  for the care and treatment of persons with\ndiverse mental disabilities, and its obligation to admini s-\nter services with an even hand.\nI\nThis case, as it comes to us, presents no constitutional\nquestion.  The complaints filed by plaintiffs-respondents\nL. C. and E. W. did include such an issue; L. C. and E. W.\nalleged  that defendants-petitioners, Georgia health care\nofficials,  failed to afford them minimally adequate care\nand freedom from undue restraint, in violation of their\nrights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment.  See Complaint ¶¶87–91; Intervenor ’s Com-\nplaint ¶¶30–34.  But neither the District Court nor the\nCourt of Appeals reached those Fourteenth Amendment\nclaims.  See Civ. No. 1:95–cv–1210–MHS (ND Ga., Mar.\n26, 1997), pp. 5–6, 11–13, App. to Pet. for Cert. 34a–35a,\n40a–41a; 138 F. 3d 893, 895, and n.  3 (CA11 1998).  I n-\nstead, the courts below resolved the case solely on stat u-\ntory  grounds.  Our review is similarly confined.  Cf.\nCleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc. , 473 U. S. 432,\n450 (1985) (Texas city’s requirement of special use permit\nfor operation of group home for mentally retarded, when\nother  care and multiple-dwelling facilities were freely\npermitted,  lacked rational basis and therefore violated\nEqual  Protection Clause of Fourteenth Amendment).\nMindful that it is a statute we are construing, we set out\nfirst the legislative and regulatory prescriptions on which\nthe case turns.\nIn the opening provisions of the ADA, Congress stated\nfindings applicable to the statute in all its parts.  Most\nrelevant to this case, Congress determined that\n“(2) historically, society has tended to isolate and\n\nCite as: ____ U.

[and] se g-\nregation . . . .”  42 U. S. C. §§12101(a)(2), (3), (5).1\nCongress then set forth prohibitions against discrimin a-\ntion in employment (Title I, §§12111–12117), public ser v-\nices furnished by governmental entities (Title II, §§12131–\n12165),  and public accommodations provided by private\nentities (Title III, §§12181–12189).  The statute as a whole\nis intended “to provide a clear and comprehensive national\nmandate  for the elimination of discrimination against\nindividuals with disabilities.”  §12101(b)(1).2\n— — — — — —\n1The ADA, enacted in 1990, is the Federal Government’s most recent\n \nand extensive endeavor to address discrimination against persons with\ndisabilities.  Earlier legislative efforts included the Rehabilitation Act\nof 1973, 87 Stat. 355, 29 U. S. C. §701 et seq. (1976 ed.), and the Devel-\nopmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill of Rights Act, 89 Stat. 486, 42\nU. S. C. §6001 et seq. (1976 ed.), enacted in 1975.  In the ADA, Congress\nfor the first time referred expressly to  “segregation”  of persons with\ndisabilities as a “for[m] of discrimination,”  and to discrimination that\npersists in the area of “institutionalization.”  §§12101(a)(2), (3), (5).\n2The ADA defines “disability,” “with respect to an individual,” as\n \n“(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or\nmore of the major life activities of such individual;\n“(B) a record of such an impairment; or\n\n4 OLMSTEAD v. L. C.\nOpinion of the Court\nThis case concerns Title II, the public services portion of\nthe  ADA.3   The provision of Title II centrally at issue\nreads:  \n“Subject  to the provisions of this subchapter, no\nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason\nof such disability, be excluded from participation in or\nbe denied the benefits of the services, programs, or a c-\ntivities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrim i-\nnation by any such entity.”  §12132.\nTitle  II’s  definition section states that  “public  entity”\nincludes  “any State or local government, ”  and “any  de-\npartment,  agency, [or] special purpose district. ”\n§§12131(1)(A),  (B).  The same section defines  “qualified\nindividual with a disability” as\n“an individual with a disability who, with or without\nreasonable  modifications to rules, policies, or pra c-\ntices, the removal of architectural, communication, or\ntransportation barriers, or the provision of auxiliary\naids and services, meets the essential eligibility r e-\nquirements for the receipt of services or the particip a-\ntion in programs or activities provided by a public e n-\ntity.”  §12131(2).\nOn redress for violations of §12132 ’s discrimination prohi-\nbition, Congress referred to remedies available under §505\nof the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 92 Stat. 2982, 29 U. S. C.\n§794a.  See 42 U. S. C. §12133 (“The remedies, procedures,\nand rights set forth in [§505 of the Rehabilitation Act]\n— — — — — —\n“(C) being regarded as having such an impairment.”  §12102(2).\nThere is no dispute that L. C. and E. W. are disabled within the mea n-\ning of the ADA.\n3In addition to the provisions set out in Part A governing public\n \nservices generally, see §§12131–12134, Title II contains in Part B a\nhost  of provisions governing public transportation services, see\n§§12141–12165.\n\nCite as: ____ U. S. ____ (1999) 5\nOpinion of the Court\nshall  be the remedies, procedures, and rights this su b-\nchapter provides to any person alleging discrimination on\nthe basis of disability in violation of section 12132 of this\ntitle.”).4\nCongress  instructed the Attorney General to issue\nregulations implementing provisions of Title II, including\n§12132’s  discrimination proscription.  See §12134(a)\n(“[T]he Attorney General shall promulgate regulations in\nan accessible format that implement this part. ”).5  The\n— — — — — —\n4Section 505 of the Rehabilitation Act incorporates the remedies,\n \nrights, and procedures set forth in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964 for violations of §504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  See 29 U.  S. C.\n§794a(a)(2).  Title VI, in turn, directs each federal department autho r-\nized to extend financial assistance to any department or agency of a\nState to issue rules and regulations consistent with achievement of the\nobjectives of the statute authorizing financial assistance.  See 78 Stat.\n252, 42 U. S. C. §2000d–1.  Compliance with such requirements may be\neffected by the termination or denial of federal funds, or  “by any other\nmeans authorized by law.”  Ibid.  Remedies both at law and in equity\nare available for violations of the statute.  See §2000d–7(a)(2).\n5Congress directed the Secretary of Transportation to issue regul a-\ntions implementing the portion of Title II concerning public transport a-\ntion.  See 42 U. S. C. §§12143(b), 12149, 12164.  As stated in the regula-\ntions, a person alleging discrimination on the basis of disability in\nviolation of Title II may seek to enforce its provisions by commencing a\nprivate lawsuit, or by filing a complaint with (a) a federal agency that\nprovides funding to the public entity that is the subject of the co m-\nplaint, (b) the Department of Justice for referral to an appropriate\nagency, or (c) one of eight federal agencies responsible for investigating\ncomplaints arising under Title II: the Department of Agriculture, the\nDepartment  of Education, the Department of Health and Human\nServices, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the\nDepartment of the Interior, the Department of Justice, the Department\nof  Labor, and the Department of Transportation.  See 28 CFR\n§§35.170(c), 35.172(b), 35.190(b) (1998).\nThe ADA contains several other provisions allocating regulatory and\nenforcement responsibility.  Congress instructed the Equal Emplo y-\nment  Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to issue regulations impl e-\nmenting Title I, see 42 U.  S. C. §12116; the EEOC, the Attorney Ge n-\neral, and persons alleging discrimination on the basis of disability in\n\n6 OLMSTEAD v. L. C.\nOpinion of the Court\nAttorney General’s regulations, Congress further directed,\n“shall be consistent with this chapter and with the coord i-\nnation regulations . . . applicable to recipients of Federal\nfinancial  assistance under [§504 of the Rehabilitation\nAct].”   42 U. S. C. §12134(b).  One of the §504 regulations\nrequires  recipients of federal funds to  “administer  pro-\ngrams and activities in the most integrated setting appr o-\npriate to the needs of qualified handicapped persons. ”   28\nCFR §41.51(d) (1998).\nAs  Congress instructed, the Attorney General issued\nTitle II regulations, see 28 CFR pt. 35 (1998), including\none modeled on the §504 regulation just quoted; called the\n“integration regulation,” it reads:\n“A  public entity shall administer services, pr o-\ngrams, and activities in the most integrated setting\nappropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with\ndisabilities.”  28 CFR §35.130(d) (1998).\nThe preamble to the Attorney General ’s Title II regul a-\ntions defines “the most integrated setting appropriate to\nthe  needs of qualified individuals with disabilities ”  to\nmean “a setting that enables individuals with disabilities\nto interact with non-disabled persons to the fullest extent\npossible.”   28 CFR pt. 35, App. A, p. 450 (1998).  Another\nregulation  requires public entities to  “make  reasonable\nmodifications”  to  avoid  “discrimination  on the basis of\ndisability,”  unless  those modifications would entail a\n— — — — — —\nviolation of Title I may enforce its provisions, see §12117(a) .  Congress\nsimilarly instructed the Secretary of Transportation and the Attorney\nGeneral to issue regulations implementing provisions of Title III, see\n§§12186(a)(1), (b); the Attorney General and persons alleging discrim i-\nnation on the basis of disability in violation of Title III may enforce its\nprovisions, see §§12188(a)(1), (b).  Each federal agency responsible for\nADA  implementation may render technical assistance to affected\nindividuals and institutions with respect to provisions of the ADA for\nwhich the agency has responsibility.  See §12206(c)(1).\n\nCite as: ____ U. S. ____ (1999) 7\nOpinion of the Court\n“fundamenta[l] alter[ation]”; called here the  “reasonable-\nmodifications regulation,” it provides:\n“A  public entity shall make reasonable modific a-\ntions  in policies, practices, or procedures when the\nmodifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on\nthe basis of disability, unless the public entity can\ndemonstrate  that making the modifications would\nfundamentally  alter the nature of the service, pr o-\ngram, or activity.”  28 CFR §35.130(b)(7) (1998).\nWe recite these regulations with the caveat that we do not\nhere determine their validity.  While the parties differ on\nthe  proper construction and enforcement of the regul a-\ntions, we do not understand petitioners to challenge the\nregulatory  formulations themselves as outside the co n-\ngressional authorization.  See Brief for Petitioners 16–17,\n36, 40–41; Reply Brief 15–16 (challenging the Attorney\nGeneral’s interpretation of the integration regulation).\nII\nWith  the key legislative provisions in full view, w e\nsummarize the facts underlying this dispute.  Respondents\nL. C. and E. W. are mentally retarded women; L. C. has\nalso been diagnosed with schizophrenia, and E. W., with a\npersonality  disorder.  Both women have a history of\ntreatment in institutional settings.  In May 1992, L. C.\nwas voluntarily admitted to Georgia Regional Hospital at\nAtlanta (GRH), where she was confined for treatment in a\npsychiatric unit.  By May 1993, her psychiatric condition\nhad stabilized, and L. C.’s treatment team at GRH agreed\nthat her needs could be met appropriately in one of the\ncommunity-based programs the State supported.  Despite\nthis  evaluation, L. C. remained institutionalized until\nFebruary 1996, when the State placed her in a comm u-\nnity-based treatment program.\nE. W. was  voluntarily admitted to GRH in February\n\n8 OLMSTEAD v. L. C.\nOpinion of the Court\n1995; like L. C., E. W. was confined for treatment in a\npsychiatric unit.  In March 1995, GRH sought to discharge\nE. W. to a homeless shelter, but abandoned that plan after\nher attorney filed an administrative complaint.  By 1996,\nE. W.’s treating psychiatrist concluded that she could be\ntreated appropriately in a community-based setting.  She\nnonetheless remained institutionalized until a few months\nafter the District Court issued its judgment in this case in\n1997.\nIn  May 1995, when she was still institutionalized at\nGRH, L. C. filed suit in the United  States District Court\nfor the Northern District of Georgia, challenging her co n-\ntinued  confinement in a segregated environment.  Her\ncomplaint invoked 42 U. S.

L. C. alleged that the State ’s\nfailure to place her in a community-based program, once\nher treating professionals determined that such placement\nwas appropriate, violated, inter alia, Title II of the ADA.\nL. C.’s pleading requested, among other things, that the\nState place her in a community care residential program,\nand that she receive treatment with the ultimate goal of\nintegrating  her into the mainstream of society.  E. W.\nintervened in the action, stating an identical claim.6\n— — — — — —\n6L. C. and E. W. are currently receiving treatment in community-\n \nbased programs.  Nevertheless, the case is not moot.  As the District\nCourt and Court of Appeals explained, in view of the multiple instit u-\ntional placements L. C. and E. W. have experienced, the controversy\nthey brought to court is “capable of repetition, yet evading review.”  No.\n1:95–cv–1210–MHS (ND Ga., Mar. 26, 1997), p. 6, App. to Pet. for Cert.\n35a (internal quotation marks omitted); see 138 F.  3d 893, 895, n.  2\n(CA11 1998) (citing Honig v.

S. ____ (1999) 9\nOpinion of the Court\nThe District Court granted partial summary judgment\nin favor of L. C. and E. W.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 31a–\n42a.  The court held that the State ’s failure to place L. C.\nand E. W. in an appropriate community-based treatment\nprogram violated Title II of the ADA.  See  id., at 39a, 41a.\nIn so ruling, the court rejected the State ’s argument that\ninadequate funding, not discrimination against L. C. and\nE. W. “by reason of”  their disabilities, accounted for their\nretention at GRH.  Under Title II, the court concluded,\n“unnecessary  institutional segregation of the disabled\nconstitutes discrimination per se, which cannot be justified\nby a lack of funding.”  Id., at 37a.\nIn addition to contending that L. C. and E. W. had not\nshown discrimination “by reason of [their] disabilit[ies], ”\nthe State resisted court intervention on the ground that\nrequiring immediate transfers in cases of this order would\n“fundamentally  alter”  the  State’s  activity.  The State\nreasserted that it was already using all available funds to\nprovide services to other persons with disabilities.  See id.,\nat  38a.  Rejecting the State ’s  “fundamental  alteration”\ndefense, the court observed that existing state programs\nprovided  community-based treatment of the kind for\nwhich L. C. and E. W. qualified, and that the State could\n“provide services to plaintiffs in the community at consi d-\nerably less cost than is required to maintain them in an\ninstitution.”  Id., at 39a.\nThe Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed\nthe  judgment of the District Court, but remanded for\nreassessment of the State ’s cost-based defense.  See 138\nF. 3d, at 905.  As the appeals court read the statute and\nregulations: When “a disabled individual’s treating profes-\nsionals find that a community-based placement is appr o-\npriate  for that individual, the ADA imposes a duty to\nprovide  treatment in a community setting —the  most\nintegrated  setting appropriate to that patient ’s  needs”;\n“[w]here there is no such finding [by the treating profe s-\n\n10 OLMSTEAD v. L. C.\nOpinion of the Court\nsionals], nothing in the ADA requires the deinstitutional i-\nzation of th[e] patient.”  Id., at 902.\nThe Court of Appeals recognized that the State’s duty to\nprovide  integrated services  “is  not absolute ”;  under the\nAttorney General’s Title II regulation, “reasonable modifi-\ncations”  were  required of the State, but fundamental\nalterations were not demanded.   Id., at 904.  The appeals\ncourt thought it clear, however, that  “Congress wanted to\npermit a cost defense only in the most limited of circu m-\nstances.”  Id., at 902.  In conclusion, the court stated that\na cost justification would fail “[u]nless the State can prove\nthat requiring it to [expend additional funds in order to\nprovide L. C. and E. W. with integrated services] would be\nso unreasonable given the demands of the State ’s mental\nhealth budget that it would fundamentally alter the ser v-\nice [the State] provides.”  Id., at 905.  Because it appeared\nthat the District Court had entirely ruled out a  “lack of\nfunding”  justification, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 37a, the\nappeals court remanded, repeating that the District Court\nshould consider, among other things,  “whether the addi-\ntional expenditures necessary to treat L. C. and E. W. in\ncommunity-based care would be unreasonable given the\ndemands of the State’s mental health budget.”   138 F. 3d,\nat 905.7\nWe granted certiorari in view of the importance of the\nquestion presented to the States and affected individuals.\n— — — — — —\n7After this Court granted certiorari, the District Court issued a dec i-\n \nsion on remand rejecting the State ’s fundamental-alteration defense.\nSee 1:95–cv–1210–MHS (ND Ga., Jan. 29, 1999), p. 1.  The court\nconcluded that the annual cost to the State of providing community-\nbased treatment to L. C. and E. W. was not unreasonable in relation to\nthe State’s overall mental health budget.  See id., at 5.  In reaching that\njudgment, the District Court first declared  “irrelevant”  the potential\nimpact of its decision beyond L. C. and E. W.  1:95–cv–1210-MHS (ND\nGa., Oct. 20, 1998), p.  3, App. 177.  The District Court ’s decision on\nremand is now pending appeal before the Eleventh Circuit.\n\nCite as: ____ U.

S. C. §12132; the second concerned the\nobligation of the States to counter discrimination.  As to\nthe first, the Attorney General concluded that unjustified\nplacement or retention of persons in institutions, severely\nlimiting their exposure to the outside community, const i-\ntutes a form of discrimination based on disability prohi b-\nited by Title II.  See 28 CFR §35.130(d) (1998) ( “A public\nentity shall administer services . . . in the most integrated\nsetting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals\nwith  disabilities.”);  Brief for United States as   Amicus\nCuriae in Helen L. v. DiDario, No. 94–1243 (CA3 1994),\npp. 8,  15–16 (unnecessary segregation of persons with\ndisabilities constitutes a form of discrimination prohibited\nby the ADA and the integration regulation).  Regarding\nthe  States ’ obligation  to avoid unjustified isolation of\nindividuals  with disabilities, the Attorney General pr o-\nvided that States could resist modifications that  “would\nfundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or\nactivity.”  28 CFR §35.130(b)(7) (1998).\nThe Court of Appeals essenti ally upheld the Attorney\nGeneral’s construction of the ADA.

Accordingly, we further hold that\nthe  Court of Appeals  ’ remand  instruction was unduly\nrestrictive.  In evaluating a State’s fundamental-alteration\ndefense, the District Court must consider, in view of the\nresources available to the State, not only the cost of pr o-\nviding community-based care to the litigants, but also the\nrange of services the State provides others with mental\ndisabilities, and the State ’s obligation to mete out those\nservices equitably.\nA\nWe examine first whether, as the Eleventh Circuit hel d,\nundue institutionalization qualifies as discrimination  “by\nreason of . . . disability. ”   The Department of Justice has\nconsistently advocated that it does.9  Because the Depar t-\n— — — — — —\n9See Brief for United States in Halderman v.

In a related legislative\nendeavor, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Congress used\nmandatory language to proscribe discrimination against\npersons with disabilities.  See 87 Stat. 394, as amended,\n29 U. S. C. §794 (1976 ed.) ( “No otherwise qualified ind i-\nvidual with a disability in the United States . . .  shall,\nsolely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from\nthe participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be su b-\njected  to discrimination under any program or activity\nreceiving  Federal financial assistance. ”  (Emphasis\n— — — — — —\nConsolidated Coin Caterers Corp.,  517 U.

C.  §12132; additionally, in\nfindings applicable to the entire statute, Congress expli c-\nitly  identified unjustified  “segregation”  of  persons with\ndisabilities  as a  “for[m]  of discrimination. ”    See\n§12101(a)(2)  (“historically,  society has tended to isolate\nand segregate individuals with disabilities, and, despite\nsome improvements, such forms of discrimination against\nindividuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and\npervasive social problem”); §12101(a)(5) (“individuals with\ndisabilities  continually encounter various forms of di s-\ncrimination, including . . . segregation”).11\nRecognition  that unjustified institutional isolation of\npersons with disabilities is a form of discrimination r e-\nflects two evident judgments.

Dissimilar treatment corr e-\nspondingly exists in this key respect: In order to receive\nneeded medical services, persons with mental disabilities\nmust, because of those disabilities, relinquish particip a-\ntion in community life they could enjoy given reasonable\naccommodations,  while persons without mental disabil i-\nties can receive the medical services they need without\nsimilar sacrifice.

Title II provides only that  “qualified\nindividual[s] with a disability ”  may not “be subjected to\ndiscrimination.”   42 U. S. C. §12132.  “Qualified individu-\nals,”  the ADA further explains, are persons with disabil i-\nties  who,  “with  or without reasonable modifications to\nrules, policies, or practices, . . . mee[t] the essential elig i-\nbility requirements for the receipt of services or the pa r-\nticipation in programs or activities provided by a public\nentity.”  §12131(2).\nConsistent  with these provisions, the State generally\nmay rely on the reasonable assessments of its own profe s-\nsionals in determining whether an individual  “meets the\nessential  eligibility requirements ”  for  habilitation in a\ncommunity-based program.  Absent such qualification, it\nwould be inappropriate to remove a patient from the more\nrestrictive setting.

In this case, however,\nthere is no genuine dispute concerning the status of L. C.\nand  E. W. as individuals  “qualified”  for  noninstitutional\ncare: The State’s own professionals determined that co m-\nmunity-based treatment would be appropriate for L. C. and\nE. W., and neither woman opposed such treatment.  See\nsupra, at 7–8.14\nB\nThe State’s responsibility, once it provides community-\nbased treatment to qualified persons with disabilities, is\nnot  boundless.  The reasonable-modifications regulation\nspeaks of “reasonable modifications”  to avoid discrimina-\ntion, and allows States to resist modifications that entail a\n“fundamenta[l]  alter[ation]”  of  the States ’ services  and\nprograms.  28 CFR §35.130(b)(7) (1998).

Sensibly\nconstrued, the fundamental-alteration component of the\nreasonable-modifications regulation would allow the State\nto  show that, in the allocation of available resources,\nimmediate relief for the plaintiffs would be inequitable,\ngiven the responsibility the State has undertaken for the\ncare and treatment of a large and diverse population of\npersons with mental disabilities.\nWhen it granted summary judgment for plaintiffs in this\ncase, the District Court compared the cost of caring for the\nplaintiffs in a community-based setting with the cost of\ncaring for them in an institution.  That simple comparison\nshowed that community placements cost less than instit u-\ntional confinements.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a.  As the\nUnited States recognizes, however, a comparison so simple\noverlooks  costs the State cannot avoid; most notably, a\n“State . . . may experience increased overall expenses by\nfunding community placements without being able to take\n\n20 OLMSTEAD v.

Knowledgeable professionals tell us that\nour society, and the governments which reflect its att i-\ntudes and preferences, have yet to grasp the potential for\ntreating mental disorders, especially severe mental illness.\nAs a result, necessary resources for the endeavor often are\nnot forthcoming.  During the course of a year, about 5.6\nmillion Americans will suffer from severe mental illness.\nE. Torrey, Out of the Shadows 4 (1997).  Some 2.2 million\nof these persons receive no treatment.   Id., at 6.  Millions\nof other Americans suffer from mental disabilities of less\nserious degree, such as mild depression.  These facts are\npart of the background against which this case arises.  In\naddition, of course, persons with mental disabilities have\nbeen  subject to historic mistreatment, indifference, and\nhostility.  See, e.g., Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center,\nInc., 473 U. S. 432, 461–464 (1985) (Marshall, J., concu r-\n\n2 OLMSTEAD v. L. C.\nKENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment\nring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (discus s-\ning treatment of the mentally retarded).\nDespite these obstacles, the States have acknowledged\nthat  the care of the mentally disabled is their special\nobligation.  They operate and support facilities and pr o-\ngrams, sometimes elaborate ones, to provide care.  It is a\ncontinuing challenge, though, to provide the care in an\neffective and humane way, particularly because societal\nattitudes  and the responses of public authorities have\nchanged from time to time.\nBeginning in the 1950’s, many victims of severe mental\nillness were moved out of state-run hospitals, often with\nbenign objectives.  According to one estimate, when a d-\njusted for population growth,  “the actual decrease in the\nnumbers of people with severe mental illnesses in public\npsychiatric hospitals between 1955 and 1995 was 92 pe r-\ncent.”   Brief for American Psychiatric Association et  al. as\nAmici Curiae 21, n. 5 (citing Torrey, supra, at 8–9).  This\nwas  not without benefit or justification.  The so-called\n“deinstitutionalization”  has permitted a substantial nu m-\nber of mentally disabled persons to receive needed trea t-\nment with greater freedom and dignity.  It may be, more o-\nver, that those who remain institutionalized are indeed\nthe most severe cases.  With reference to this case, as the\nCourt points out, ante, at 7–8, 17–18, it is undisputed that\nthe  State’s  own treating professionals determined that\ncommunity-based  care was medically appropriate for\nrespondents.    Nevertheless, the depopulation of state\nmental  hospitals has its dark side.  According to one\nexpert:\n“For a substantial minority. . . deinstitutionaliz a-\ntion has been a psychiatric  Titanic.  Their lives are\nvirtually devoid of ‘dignity ’ or ‘integrity of body, mind,\nand spirit. ’ ‘  Self-determination ’ often means merely\nthat the person has a choice of soup kitchens.  The\n\nCite as: ____ U. S. ____ (1999) 3\nKENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment\n‘least restrictive setting ’ frequently turns out to be a\ncardboard box, a jail cell, or a terror-filled existence\nplagued by both real and imaginary enemies.”  Torrey,\nsupra, at 11.\nIt must be remembered that for the person with severe\nmental illness who has no treatment the most dreaded of\nconfinements can be the imprisonment inflicted by his own\nmind,  which shuts reality out and subjects him to the\ntorment of voices and images beyond our own powers to\ndescribe.\nIt would be unreasonable, it would be a tragic event,\nthen, were the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990\n(ADA) to be interpreted so that States had some incentive,\nfor fear of litigation, to drive those in need of medical care\nand treatment out of appropriate care and into settings\nwith too little assistance and supervision.  The opinion of a\nresponsible treating physician in determining the appr o-\npriate  conditions for treatment ought to be given the\ngreatest of deference.  It is a common phenomenon that a\npatient functions well with medication, yet, because of the\nmental  illness itself, lacks the discipline or capacity to\nfollow the regime the medication requires.  This is illu s-\ntrative of the factors a responsible physician will consider\nin  recommending the appropriate setting or facility for\ntreatment.  JUSTICE GINSBURG’s opinion takes account of\nthis background.  It is careful, and quite correct, to say\nthat it is not  “the ADA’s mission to drive States to move\ninstitutionalized  patients into an inappropriate setting,\nsuch as a homeless shelter . . . .”  Ante, at 20.\nIn light of these concerns, if the principle of liability\nannounced by the Court is not applied with caution and\ncircumspection, States may be pressured into attempting\ncompliance on the cheap, placing marginal patients into\nintegrated settings devoid of the services and attention\nnecessary for their condition.  This danger is in addition to\n\n4 OLMSTEAD v. L. C.\nKENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment\nthe federalism costs inherent in referring state decisions\nregarding the administration of treatment programs and\nthe allocation of resources to the reviewing authority of\nthe federal courts.  It is of central importance, then, that\ncourts apply today’s decision with great deference to the\nmedical decisions of the responsible, treating physicians\nand, as the Court makes clear, with appropriate deference\nto the program funding decisions of state policymakers.\nII\nWith these reservations made explicit, in my  view we\nmust remand the case for a determination of the questions\nthe Court poses and for a determination whether respo nd-\nents can show a violation of 42 U.  S. C. §12132’s ban on\ndiscrimination based on the summary judgment materials\non file or any further pleadings and materials properly\nallowed.\nAt the outset it should be noted there is no allegation\nthat  Georgia officials acted on the basis of animus or\nunfair  stereotypes regarding the disabled.  Underlying\nmuch discrimination law is the notion that animus can\nlead to false and unjustified stereotypes, and vice versa.\nOf course, the line between animus and stereotype is often\nindistinct, and it is not always necessary to distinguish\nbetween them.  Section 12132 can be understood to deem\nas irrational, and so to prohibit, distinctions by which a\nclass of disabled persons, or some within that class, are, by\nreason of their disability and without adequate justific a-\ntion, exposed by a state entity to more onerous treatment\nthan a comparison group in the provision of services or the\nadministration  of existing programs, or indeed entirely\nexcluded from state programs or facilities.  Discrimination\nunder this statute might in principle be shown in the case\nbefore us, though further proceedings should be required.\nPutting aside issues of animus or unfair stereotype, I\nagree with JUSTICE THOMAS that on the ordinary interpre-\ntation and meaning of the term, one who alleges discrim i-\n\nCite as: ____ U. S. ____ (1999) 5\nKENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment\nnation must show that she “received differential treatment\nvis-à-vis members of a different group on the basis of a\nstatutorily  described characteristic. ”  Post,  at 1–2 (di s-\nsenting opinion).  In my view, however, discrimination so\ndefined might be shown here.  Although the Court seems\nto  reject  JUSTICE  THOMAS ’ definition  of discrimination,\nante, at 13, it asserts that unnecessary institutional care\ndoes lead to “[d]issimilar treatment,”  ante, at 16.  Accord-\ning  to the Court,  “[i]n  order to receive needed medical\nservices, persons with mental disabilities must, because of\nthose disabilities, relinquish participation in community\nlife  they could enjoy given reasonable accommodations,\nwhile persons without mental disabilities can receive the\nmedical services they need without similar sacrifice.” Ibid.\nAlthough this point is not discussed at lengt h by the\nCourt, it does serve to suggest the theory under which\nrespondents might be subject to discrimination in violation\nof §12132.  If they could show that persons needing ps y-\nchiatric or other medical services to treat a mental di s-\nability are subject to a more onerous condition than are\npersons eligible for other existing state medical services,\nand if removal of the condition would not be a fundame n-\ntal alteration of a program or require the creation of a new\none, then the beginnings of a discrimination case would be\nestablished.  In terms more specific to this case, if respo nd-\nents  could show that Georgia (i) provides treatment to\nindividuals suffering from medical problems of comparable\nseriousness, (ii) as a general matter, does so in the most\nintegrated setting appropriate for the treatment of those\nproblems (taking medical and other practical consider a-\ntions into account), but (iii) without adequate justification,\nfails  to do so for a group of mentally disabled persons\n(treating  them instead in separate, locked institutional\nfacilities), I believe it would demonstrate discrimination\non the basis of mental disability.\nOf course, it is a quite different matter to say that a\n\n6 OLMSTEAD v. L. C.\nKENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment\nState without a program in place is required to create one.\nNo State has unlimited resources and each must make\nhard decisions on how much to allocate to treatment of\ndiseases and disabilities.  If, for example, funds for care\nand treatment of the mentally ill, including the severely\nmentally  ill, are reduced in order to support programs\ndirected to the treatment and care of other disabilities, the\ndecision may be unfortunate.  The judgment, however, is a\npolitical  one and not within the reach of the statute.\nGrave constitutional concerns are raised when a federal\ncourt is given the authority to review the State’s choices in\nbasic matters such as establishing or declining to establish\nnew programs.  It is not reasonable to read the ADA to\npermit court intervention in these decisions.  In addition,\nas the Court notes,  ante, at 6–7, by regulation a public\nentity is required only to make  “reasonable modifications\nin  policies, practices, or procedures ”  when  necessary to\navoid  discrimination and is not even required to make\nthose if “the modifications would fundamentally alter the\nnature  of the service, program, or activity. ”  28  CFR\n§35.130(b)(7) (1998).  It follows that a State may not be\nforced to create a community-treatment program where\nnone exists.  See Brief for United States as  Amicus Curiae\n19–20,  and n. 3.  Whether a different stat utory scheme\nwould exceed constitutional limits need not be addressed.\nDiscrimination,  of course, tends to be an expansive\nconcept and, as legal category, it must be applied with\ncare  and prudence.  On any reasonable reading of the\nstatute,  §12132 cannot cover all types of differential\ntreatment of disabled and nondisabled persons, no matter\nhow minimal or innocuous.  To establish discrimination in\nthe context of this case, and absent a showing of policies\nmotivated by improper animus or stereotypes, it would be\nnecessary to show that a comparable or similarly situated\ngroup received differential treatment.  Regulations are an\nimportant tool in identifying the kinds of contexts, pol i-\n\nCite as: ____ U. S. ____ (1999) 7\nKENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment\ncies,  and practices that raise concerns under the ADA.\nThe congressional findings in 42 U. S. C. §12101 also serve\nas a useful aid for courts to discern the sorts of discrimina-\ntion with which Congress was concerned.  Indeed, those\nfindings have clear bearing on the issues raised in this\ncase, and support the conclusion that unnecessary instit u-\ntionalization  may be the evidence or the result of the\ndiscrimination the ADA prohibits.\nUnlike JUSTICE THOMAS, I deem it relevant and instruc-\ntive that Congress in express terms identified the  “iso-\nlat[ion] and segregat[ion]” of disabled persons by society as\na “for[m] of discrimination,”  §§12101(a)(2), (5), and noted\nthat discrimination against the disabled  “persists in such\ncritical  areas as . . . institutionalization, ”  §12101(a)(3).\nThese findings do not show that segregation and instit u-\ntionalization  are always discriminatory or that segreg a-\ntion or institutionalization are, by their nature, forms of\nprohibited  discrimination.  Nor do they necessitate a\nregime in which individual treatment plans are required,\nas distinguished from broad and reasonable classifications\nfor the provision of health care services.  Instead, they\nunderscore  Congress ’ concern  that discrimination has\nbeen  a frequent and pervasive problem in institutional\nsettings  and policies and its concern that segregating\ndisabled persons from others can be discriminatory.  Both\nof those concerns are consistent with the normal definition\nof  discrimination—differential  treatment of similarly\nsituated groups.  The findings inform application of that\ndefinition  in specific cases, but absent guidance to the\ncontrary, there is no reason to think they displace it.  The\nissue  whether respondents have been discriminated\nagainst  under §12132 by institutionalized treatment\ncannot be decided in the abstract, divorced from the facts\nsurrounding treatment programs in their State.\nThe possibility therefore remains that, on the facts of\nthis case, respondents would be able to support a claim\n\n8 OLMSTEAD v. L. C.\nKENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment\nunder §12132 by showing that they have been subject to\ndiscrimination by Georgia officials on the basis of their\ndisability.  This inquiry would not be simple.  Compar i-\nsons of different medical conditions and the corresponding\ntreatment  regimens might be difficult, as would be a s-\nsessments of the degree of integration of various settings\nin which medical treatment is offered.  For example, the\nevidence  might show that, apart from services for the\nmentally disabled, medical treatment is rarely offered in a\ncommunity setting but also is rarely offered in facilities\ncomparable to state mental hospitals.  Determining the\nrelevance of that type of evidence would require conside r-\nable  judgment and analysis.  However, as petitioners\nobserve, “[i]n this case, no class of similarly situated ind i-\nviduals was even identified, let alone shown to be given\npreferential treatment.”  Brief for Petitioners 21.  Without\nadditional  information regarding the details of state-\nprovided medical services in Georgia, we cannot address\nthe issue in the way the statute demands.  As a cons e-\nquence, the judgment of the courts below, granting partial\nsummary judgment to respondents, ought not to be su s-\ntained.   In addition, as   JUSTICE  GINSBURG’s  opinion is\ncareful to note,  ante, at 19, it was error in the earlier\nproceedings  to restrict the relevance and force of the\nState’s evidence regarding the comparative costs of trea t-\nment.  The State is entitled to wide discretion in adopting\nits  own systems of cost analysis, and, if it chooses, to\nallocate health care resources based on fixed and overhead\ncosts for whole institutions and programs.  We must be\ncautious  when we seek to infer specific rules limiting\nStates ’ choices  when Congress has used only general\nlanguage in the controlling statute.\nI would remand the case to the Court of Appeals or the\nDistrict  Court for it to determine in the first instance\nwhether a statutory violation is sufficiently alleged and\nsupported in respondents ’ summary judgment materials\n\nCite as: ____ U.

I disagree.  Temporary\nexclusion from community placement does not amount to\n“discrimination”  in the traditional sense of the word, nor\nhave respondents shown that petitioners  “discriminated”\nagainst them “by reason of” their disabilities.\nUntil today, this Court has never endorsed an interpr e-\ntation  of the term  “discrimination”  that  encompassed\ndisparate  treatment among members of the   same  pro-\ntected  class.  Discrimination, as typically understood,\nrequires a showing that a claimant received differential\n\n2 OLMSTEAD v. L. C.\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting\ntreatment vis-à-vis members of a different group on the\nbasis of a statutorily described characteristic.  This inte r-\npretation comports with dictionary definitions of the term\ndiscrimination, which means to “distinguish,” to “differen-\ntiate,”  or to make a  “distinction in favor of or against, a\nperson or thing based on the group, class, or category to\nwhich that person or thing belongs rather than on ind i-\nvidual  merit.”    Random  House Dictionary 564 (2d ed.\n1987);  see also Webster ’s  Third New International Di c-\ntionary  648 (1981) (defining  “discrimination”  as  “the\nmaking or perceiving of a distinction or difference ”  or as\n“the act, practice, or an instance of discriminating cat e-\ngorically rather than individually”).\nOur decisions construing various statutory prohibitions\nagainst “discrimination” have not wavered from this path.\nThe best place to begin is with Title VII of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, the paradigmatic\nanti-discrimination law.1  Title VII makes it  “an unlawful\n— — — — — —\n1We have incorporated Title VII standards of discrimination when\n \ninterpreting statutes prohibiting other forms of discrimination.

See  Saint Francis College v. Al-Khazraji, 481\nU. S. 604, 609 (1987).  This Court has applied the  “framework” devel-\noped in Title VII cases to claims brought under this statute.   Patterson\nv.

S. 1071\n(1994) (explaining that under Title VII, a fired black e m-\nployee  “had  to show that although he was not a good\nemployee, equally bad employees were treated more len i-\nently by [his employer] if they happened not to be black”).\nOur cases interpreting §504 of the Rehabilitation Act of\n1973, 87 Stat. 394, as amended, which prohibits  “discrimi-\nnation”  against certain individuals with disabilities, have\napplied this commonly understood meaning of discrimin a-\ntion.   Section 504 provides:\n“No  otherwise qualified handicapped individual .  . .\nshall, solely by reason of his handicap, be excluded\nfrom the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or\nbe subjected to discrimination under any program or\nactivity receiving Federal financial assistance.”\nIn keeping with the traditional paradigm, we have always\nlimited the application of the term  “discrimination”  in the\nRehabilitation Act to a person who is a member of a pr o-\ntected group and faces discrimination  “by reason of his\nhandicap.”   Indeed, we previously rejected the argument\nthat §504 requires the type of  “affirmative efforts to over-\ncome the disabilities caused by handicaps, ”   Southeastern\nCommunity College v. Davis, 442 U. S. 397, 410 (1979),\n— — — — — —\naltered the burden of proof with respect to a disparate impact discrim i-\nnation claim.  See id., §105 (codified at 42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(k)).  This\nchange highlights the principle that a departure from the traditional\nunderstanding  of discrimination requires congressional action.  Cf.\nField v. Mans, 516 U. S. 59, 69–70 (1995) (Congress legislates against\nthe background rule of the common law and traditional notions of\nlawful conduct).\n\nCite as: ____ U. S. ____ (1999) 5\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting\nthat the majority appears to endorse today.  Instead, we\nfound that §504 required merely  “the evenhanded treat-\nment of handicapped persons ”  relative to those persons\nwho do not have disabilities.   Ibid.  Our conclusion was\ninformed by the fact that some provisions of the Rehabil i-\ntation Act envision “affirmative action”  on behalf of those\nindividuals with disabilities, but §504 itself “does not refer\nat all”  to such action.  Ibid.  Therefore, “[a] comparison of\nthese provisions demonstrates that Congress understood\naccommodation  of the needs of handicapped individuals\nmay require affirmative action and knew how to provide\nfor it in those instances where it wished to do so. ”   Id., at\n411.\nSimilarly, in Alexander v. Choate, 469 U. S. 287, 302\n(1985), we found no discrimination under §504 with r e-\nspect to a limit on inpatient hospital care that was  “neu-\ntral on its face ”  and did not  “distinguish between those\nwhose coverage will be reduced and those whose coverage\nwill not on the basis of any test, judgment, or trait that\nthe handicapped as a class are less capable of meeting or\nless likely of having,”  id., at 302.  We said that §504 does\n“not . . . guarantee the handicapped equal results from the\nprovision of state Medicaid, even assuming some measure\nof equality of health could be constructed.”  Id., at 304.\nLikewise,  in  Traynor  v.  Turnage,  485 U.  S.  535, 548\n(1988), we reiterated that the purpose of §504 is to gua r-\nantee  that individuals with disabilities receive  “even-\nhanded  treatment”  relative  to those persons without\ndisabilities.   In   Traynor,  the Court upheld a Veterans ’\nAdministration  regulation that excluded  “primary  alco-\nholics”  from a benefit that was extended to persons di s-\nabled by alcoholism related to a mental disorder.   Id., at\n551.  In so doing, the Court noted that,  “[t]his litigation\ndoes not involve a program or activity that is alleged to\ntreat handicapped persons less favorably than nonhand i-\ncapped persons.”  Id., at 548.  Given the theory of the case,\n\n6 OLMSTEAD v. L. C.\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting\nthe Court explicitly held:  “There is nothing in the Reh a-\nbilitation Act that requires that any benefit extended to\none category of handicapped persons also be extended to\nall other categories of handicapped persons.”  Id., at 549.\nThis same understanding of discrimination also informs\nthis Court’s constitutional interpretation of the term.  See\nGeneral Motors Corp. v. Tracy, 519 U. S. 278, 298 (1997)\n(noting with respect to interpreting the Commerce Clause,\n“[c]onceptually,  of course, any notion of discrimination\nassumes a comparison of substantially similar entities ”);\nYick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S 356, 374 (1886) (condemning\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment “illegal discriminations\nbetween persons in similar circumstances ”); see also Ada-\nrand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U. S. 200, 223–224\n(1995); Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 493–\n494 (1989) (plurality opinion).\nDespite  this traditional understanding, the majority\nderives a more  “capacious”  definition of “discrimination,”\nas that term is used in Title II of the ADA, one that i n-\ncludes “institutional isolation of persons with disabilities. ”\nAnte, at 13–14.  It chiefly relies on certain congressional\nfindings  contained within the ADA.  To be sure, those\nfindings  appear to equate institutional isolation with\nsegregation, and thereby discrimination.  See  ante, at 14\n(quoting  §§12101(a)(2) and 12101(a)(5), both of which\nexplicitly identify “segregation” of persons with disabilities\nas a form of  “discrimination”); see also ante, at 2–3.  The\ncongressional  findings, however, are written in general,\nhortatory terms and provide little guidance to the inte r-\npretation of the specific language of §12132.  See  National\nOrganization for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 510 U. S. 249,\n260 (1994) (“We also think that the quoted statement of\ncongressional findings is a rather thin reed upon which to\nbase  a requirement ”).  In my view, the vague congre s-\nsional findings upon which the majority relies simply do\nnot suffice to show that Congress sought to overturn a\n\nCite as: ____ U. S. ____ (1999) 7\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting\nwell-established understanding of a statutory term (here,\n“discrimination”).4  Moreover, the majority fails to explain\nwhy terms in the findings should be given a medical co n-\ntent, pertaining to the place where a mentally retarded\nperson  is treated.  When read in context, the findings\ninstead  suggest that terms such as  “segregation”  were\nused in a more general sense, pertaining to matters such\nas  access to employment, facilities, and transportation.\nAbsent a clear directive to the contrary, we must read\n“discrimination”  in light of the common understanding of\nthe term.  We cannot expand the meaning of the term\n“discrimination” in order to invalidate policies we may find\nunfortunate.  Cf. NLRB v. Highland Park Mfg. Co. , 341\nU. S. 322, 325 (1951) (explaining that if Congress intended\nstatutory terms “to have other than their ordinarily a c-\ncepted meaning, it would and should have given them a\nspecial meaning by definition”).5\n— — — — — —\n4If such general hortatory language is sufficient, it is puzzling that\n \nthis or any other court did not reach the same conclusion long ago by\nreference to the general purpose language of the Rehabilitation Act\nitself.  See 29 U. S. C. §701 (1988 ed.) (describing the statute ’s purpose\nas “to develop and implement, through research, training, services, and\nthe guarantee of equal opportunity, comprehensive and coordinated\nprograms  of vocational rehabilitation and independent living, for\nindividuals with handicaps in order to maximize their employability,\nindependence, and integration into the workplace and the community ”\n(emphasis added)).  Further, this section has since been amended to\nproclaim in even more aspirational terms that the policy under the\nstatute is driven by, inter alia, “respect for individual dignity, personal\nresponsibility, self-determination, and pursuit of meaningful careers,\nbased on informed choice, of individuals with disabilities, ” “respect for\nthe privacy, rights, and equal access, ” and “inclusion, integration, and\nfull participation of the individuals.”  29 U. S. C. §§701(c)(1) – (3).\n5Given my conclusion, the Court need not review the integration\n \nregulation  promulgated by the Attorney General.  See 28 CFR\n§35.130(d) (1998).  Deference to a regulation is appropriate only  “‘if\n \nCongress has not expressed its intent with respect to the question, and\nthen only if the administrative interpretation is reasonable. ’”  Reno v.\n \n\n8 OLMSTEAD v. L. C.\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting\nElsewhere  in the ADA, Congres s  chose to alter the\ntraditional definition of discrimination.  Title I of the ADA,\n§12112(b)(1), defines discrimination to include  “limiting,\nsegregating, or classifying a job applicant or employee in a\nway that adversely affects the opportunities or status of\nsuch applicant or employee.”   Notably, however, Congress\ndid  not provide that this definition of discrimination,\nunlike other aspects of the ADA, applies to Title II.  Ord i-\nnary canons of construction require that we respect the\nlimited applicability of this definition of  “discrimination”\nand not import it into other parts of the law where Co n-\ngress did not see fit.  See,  e.g., Bates v. United States, 522\nU. S. 23, 29–30 (1997) ( “‘Where  Congress includes pa r-\n \nticular language in one section of a statute but omits it in\nanother section of the same Act, it is generally presumed\nthat  Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the\ndisparate  inclusion or exclusion ’”)  (quoting  Russello  v.\n \nUnited States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983)).  The majority ’s\ndefinition  of discrimination —although  not specifically\ndelineated—substantially imports the definition of Title I\ninto Title II by necessarily assuming that it is sufficient to\nfocus  exclusively on members of one particular group.\nUnder this view, discrimination occurs when some me m-\nbers of a protected group are treated differently from other\nmembers of that same group.  As the preceding discussion\nemphasizes, absent a special definition supplied by Co n-\ngress, this conclusion is a remarkable and novel propos i-\n— — — — — —\nBossier Parish School Bd., 520 U. S. 471, 483 (1997) (quoting Presley v.\nEtowah County Comm’n, 502 U. S. 491, 508 (1992)).   Here, Congress\nhas expressed its intent in §12132 and the Attorney General ’s regula-\ntion—insofar as it contradicts the settled meaning of the statutory\nterm—cannot prevail against it.  See  NLRB v. Town & Country Elec.,\nInc., 516 U. S. 85, 94 (1995) (explaining that courts interpreting a term\nwithin a statute “must infer, unless the statute otherwise dictates, that\nCongress means to incorporate the established meaning of that term ”)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nCite as: ____ U. S. ____ (1999) 9\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting\ntion that finds no support in our decisions in analogous\nareas.  For example, the majority ’s conclusion that pet i-\ntioners  “discriminated”  against  respondents is the\nequivalent to finding discrimination under Title VII where\na  black employee with deficient management skills is\ndenied  in-house training by his employer (allegedly b e-\ncause of lack of funding) because other similarly situated\nblack employees are given the in-house training.  Such a\nclaim would fly in the face of our prior case law, which\nrequires more than the assertion that a person belongs to\na protected group and did not receive some benefit.  See,\ne.g.,  Griggs,  401 U.  S.,  at 430–431 ( “Congress  did not\nintend by Title VII, however, to guarantee a job to every\nperson regardless of qualifications.  In short, the Act does\nnot command that any person be hired simply because he\nwas formerly the subject of discrimination, or because he\nis a member of a minority group”).\nAt bottom, the type of claim approved of by the majority\ndoes not concern a prohibition against certain conduct (the\ntraditional  understanding of discrimination), but rather\nimposition of a standard of care. 6  As such, the majority\n— — — — — —\n6In mandating that government agencies minimize the institutional\n \nisolation of disabled individuals, the majority appears to appropriate\nthe concept of “mainstreaming”  from the Individuals with Disabilities\nEducation Act (IDEA), 84 Stat. 175, as amended, 20 U.  S. C. §1400 et\nseq.  But IDEA is not an antidiscrimination law.  It is a grant program\nthat affirmatively requires States accepting federal funds to provide\ndisabled children with a  “free appropriate public education ”  and to\nestablish “procedures to assure that, to the maximum extent appropr i-\nate, children with disabilities .  . . are educated with children who are\nnot disabled.”  §§1412(1), (5).  Ironically, even under this broad affirma-\ntive mandate, we previously rejected a claim that IDEA required the\n“standard of care” analysis adopted by the majority today.  See Board of\nEd. of Hendrick Hudson Central School Dist., Westchester Cty.  v. Rowley,\n458 U. S. 176, 198 (1982) (“We think . . . that the requirement that a State\nprovide specialized educational services to handicapped children gene r-\nates no additional requirement that the services so provided be sufficient\n\n10 OLMSTEAD v. L. C.\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting\ncan offer no principle limiting this new species of  “dis-\ncrimination”  claim  apart from an affirmative defense\nbecause it looks merely to an individual in isolation, wit h-\nout  comparing him to otherwise similarly situated pe r-\nsons, and determines that discrimination occurs merely\nbecause that individual does not receive the treatment he\nwishes to receive.  By adopting such a broad view of di s-\ncrimination, the majority drains the term of any meaning\nother than as a proxy for decisions disapproved of by this\nCourt.\nFurther,  I fear that the majority ’s  approach imposes\nsignificant federalism costs, directing States how to make\ndecisions about their delivery of public services.  We previ-\nously  have recognized that constitutional principles of\nfederalism erect limits on the Federal Government ’s abil-\nity to direct state officers or to interfere with the functions\nof state governments.  See,  e.g., Printz v. United States,\n521 U. S. 898 (1997); New York v. United States, 505 U. S.\n144  (1992).  We have suggested that these principles\nspecifically apply to whether States are required to pr o-\nvide a certain level of benefits to individuals with disabil i-\nties.  As noted in  Alexander, in rejecting a similar theory\nunder §504 of the Rehabilitation Act:  “[N]othing . . . sug-\ngests that Congress desired to make major inroads on the\nStates ’ longstanding discretion to choose the proper mix of\namount, scope, and duration limitations on services .  . . .”\n469 U. S., at 307; see also  Bowen v. American Hospital\nAssn.,  476 U.  S.  610, 642 (1986) (plurality opinion)\n(“[N]othing in [§504] authorizes [the Secretary of Health\nand Human Services (HHS)] to commandeer state age n-\ncies . . . .

S. ____ (1999) 11\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting\nwill as the foot soldiers in a federal crusade ”).  The major-\nity’s affirmative defense will likely come as cold comfort to\nthe States that will now be forced to defend themselves in\nfederal court every time resources prevent the immediate\nplacement of a qualified individual.  In keeping with our\ntraditional deference in this area, see  Alexander, supra,\nthe  appropriate course would be to respect the States ’\nhistorical role as the dominant authority responsible for\nproviding services to individuals with disabilities.\nThe majority may remark that it actually does properly\ncompare members of different groups.  Indeed, the majo r-\nity  mentions in passing the  “[d]issimilar  treatment”  of\npersons with and without disabilities.  Ante, at 15.  It does\nso in the context of supporting its conclusion that instit u-\ntional isolation is a form of discrimination.  It cites two\ncases as standing for the unremarkable proposition that\ndiscrimination leads to deleterious stereotyping,  ante, at\n15 (citing Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 755 (1984); Man-\nhart, 435 U. S., at 707, n. 13)), and an amicus brief which\nindicates  that confinement diminishes certain everyday\nlife activities, ante, at 15 (citing Brief for American Ps y-\nchiatric  Association et  al.  20–22).   The majority then\nobserves that persons without disabilities “can receive the\nservices  they need without ”  institutionalization  and\nthereby avoid these twin deleterious effects.  Ante, at 15.  I\ndo not quarrel with the two general propositions, but I fail\nto see how they assist in resolving the issue before the\nCourt.  Further, the majority neither specifies what ser v-\nices  persons with disabilities might need, nor contends\nthat persons without disabilities need the same services as\nthose with disabilities, leading to the inference that the\ndissimilar treatment the majority observes results merely\nfrom  the fact that different classes of persons receive\ndifferent services—not from “discrimination”  as tradition-\nally defined.\n\n12 OLMSTEAD v. L. C.\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting\nFinally, it is also clear petitioners did not  “discriminate”\nagainst respondents “by reason of [their] disabili[ties], ”  as\n§12132  requires.  We have previously interpreted the\nphrase “by reason of”  as requiring proximate causation.\nSee, e.g., Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corp. ,\n503 U. S. 258, 265–266 (1992); see also  id., at 266, n. 11\n(citation of cases).  Such an interpretation is in keeping\nwith  the vernacular understanding of the phrase.  See\nAmerican Heritage Dictionary 1506 (3d ed. 1992) (defining\n“by reason of ”  as “because of”).  This statute should be\n   \nread as requiring proximate causation as well.  Respo n-\ndents do not contend that their disabilities constituted the\nproximate  cause for their exclusion.  Nor could they —\ncommunity  placement simply is not available to those\nwithout disabilities.  Continued institutional treatment of\npersons  who, though now deemed treatable in a\ncommunity placement, must wait their turn for placement,\ndoes not establish that the denial of community placement\noccurred  “by  reason of ”  their  disability.  Rather, it\nestablishes  no more than the fact that petitio ners have\nlimited resources.\n*      *      *\nFor the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.",

GRH—A is a state hospital\nfor persons suffering from acute psychiatric illnesses. GRH-A is\nnot a hospital for the habilitation of persons with mental\nretardation. Although Plaintiff was confined in May, 1992, for\ntreatment of schizophrenia, she no longer requires inpatient\npsychiatric treatment.\n2.\nDespite the professional judgment of her psychiatric treatment\n\nteam that L. C. no longer requires confinement for treatment of her\nmental illness and needs community residential and habilitation\nservices, Defendants have continued to forcibly confine Plaintiff\nto GRH-A.\n3.\nBecause Plaintiff’s mental illness no longer serves as a basis\nfor her involuntary hospitalization, Plaintiff’s continued\nconfinement is clearly based solely on her disability, mental\nretardation. This constitutes illegal discrimination against the\ndisabled.\n4.\nBecause Defendants have subjected Plaintiff to prolonged and\nunnecessary confinement in a mental hospital and thus deprived her\nof minimal habilitation in an appropriate setting, her condition\nhas regressed, she has lost basic self—care and adaptive living\nskills, and she has failed to maintain or develop other skills\nfundamental to her ability to function outside of an institution.\n5.\nDefendants have therefore violated Plaintiff’s constitutional\nand statutory rights to freedom from undue restraint, minimally\nadequate treatment, freedom from illegal discrimination, and\nplacement in the most integrated setting appropriate to her needs\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act, and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Thus,\nPlaintiff seeks immediate declaratory and injunctive relief\nrequiring Defendants to release her from GRH-A, place her in the\n2\n\nmost integrated setting appropriate to her needs, and provide her\nwith the appropriate treatment and services.\nJURISDICTION\n6.\nThis Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §~ 1331 and 1343 and 42 U.S.C. § 12133 in\nthat this is an action arising under the Americans with\nDisabilities Act, the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution, and 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n7.\nThis Court has jurisdiction to award declaratory and\ninjunctive relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §~ 2201 and 2202 and 42\nU.S.C. § 1983.\n8.\nVenue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391.\nIII.\nPARTIES\n9.\nPlaintiff, L.C., is twenty-seven years old and has a diagnosis\nof mental retardation and schizophrenia or schizoaffective\ndisorder. Her psychiatric symptoms have been controlled adequately\nfor over two years and she does not require inpatient psychiatric\nhospitalization. In spite of the evaluations and professional\njudgments of L.C.’s treatment staff that Plaintiff does not require\nhospitalization but needs community residential and habilitation\n3\n\nservices, Defendants have refused to provide such services. Thus,\nPlaintiff remains hospitalized at GRH-A, a hospital for persons\nwith active mental illness, solely by reason of her mental\nretardation with little or no provision of habilitation that is\nrelated to her mental retardation. Plaintiff is a resident of\nFulton County, Georgia.\n10.\nDefendant Tommy Olmstead is the Commissioner of the Department\nof Human Resources (‘DHR”) and is responsible for the operation of\nGRH-A, for the protection of the rights of persons confined to GRH-\nA, and for the overall provision of services to persons suffering\nfrom mental retardation and mental illness in the State of Georgia.\n11.\nDefendant Richard Fields is the Superintendent of GRH-A,\nlocated in DeKalb County, Georgia.

The Americans with Disabilities Act\n13.\nIn 1990, Congress enacted the Americans with Disabilities Act\n(“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §~12101 ~ Title II of that Act provides\nas follows:\n{NJo qualified individual with\na disability, shall by reason of\nsuch disability, be excluded from\nparticipation in or be denied the\nbenefits of the services, programs,\nor activities of a public entity, or\nbe subjected to discrimination by\nany such entity.\n42 U.S.C. § 12132.\n14.\nIn passing this Act, Congress explicitly stated that the\npurposes of the ADA were:\n(a) to provide a clear and comprehensive\nnational mandate for the elimination\nof discrimination against\nindividuals with disabilities\n(b) to invoke the sweep of congressional\nauthority, including the power to\nenforce the fourteenth amendment and\nto regulate commerce, in order to\naddress the major areas of\ndiscrimination faced day-to-day by\npeople with disabilities.\n42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(l) & (4). (Emphasis added.)\n15.\nIn defining this purpose, Congress made the following\nsignificant findings which are especially relevant to this case:\n5\n\n(a) historically, society has tended to\nisolate and segregate individuals with\ndisabilities, and, despite some\nimprovements, such forms of\ndiscrimination against individuals with\ndisabilities continue to be a serious and\npervasive social problem;\n(b) discrimination against individuals with\ndisabilities persists in such critical\nareas as institutionalization, health\n...\nservices, and access to public\n...\nservices;\n(C) . . . individuals who have experienced\ndiscrimination on the basis of disability\nhave often had no legal recourse to\nredress such discrimination;\n(d) individuals with disabilities continually\nencounter various forms of\ndiscrimination, including failure\n. . .\nto make modifications to existing\nfacilities and practices,\n.\nsegregation, and relegation to lesser\nservices\n. . .\n(e) the Nation’s proper goals regarding\nindividuals with disabilities are to\nassure independent living\n. . . . .\n42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(2),(3),(4),(5), and (8). (Emphasis added.)\n16.\nThe legislative history of the ADA comports with the statutory\nfindings that unnecessary institutionalization and segregation is\na destructive practice that Congress sought to end. This point is\nsupported most eloquently by the testimony of Senator Lowell\nWeicker, the original sponsor of the ADA and former Chair of the\nSenate Subcommittee on the Handicapped:\nFor years, this country has maintained a public policy of\nprotectionism toward people with disabilities. We have\ncreated monoliths of isolated care in institutions and in\nsegregated educational settings. It is that isolation and\nsegregation that has become the basis of the\n6\n\ndiscrimination faced by many disabled people today.\nSeparate is not equal. It was not for black[s]; it is\nnot for the disabled.\nADA Hearing before the Senate Comm. on Labor and Human Resources\nand Subcornm. on the Handicapped, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 215 (1989)\n(Emphasis added.)\n17.\nIn keeping with the statutory language and legislative\nhistory, federal regulations implementing the ADA provide that:\nA public entity shall administer services, programs, and\nactivities in the most integrated setting appropriate to\nthe needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.\n28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d) (1993) (Emphasis added.)\nB. The Fourteenth Amendment\n18.\nThe Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides in\npertinent part:\n[N]or shall any state deprive any person of life,\nliberty, or property, without due process of law\n. .\nC. Georgia Mental Health Code\n19.\nGeorgia’s Mental Health Code and implementing regulations\nprovide that:\nEach client in a facility and each person\nreceiving services for mental retardation\nshall receive habilitation that is suited to\nhis needs and is the least restrictive\nappropriate habilitation.\nO.C.G.A. § 37-4—122(a); Chapter 290-4-6-02(1)(A), Ga. Admin. Code.\n7\n\n20.\nState law further provides with regard to the habilitation of\npersons with mental retardation:\nIt is the policy of the state that the least\nrestrictive alternative placement be secured\nfor every client at every stage of his\nhabilitation. It shall be the duty of the\nfacility to assist the client in securing\nplacement in noninstitutional community\nfacilities and programs.\nO.C.G.A. § 37—4—121.\n21.\nThere are identical provisions of state law requiring\nindividualized, least restrictive appropriate treatment and\nassistance in securing community placement for mentally ill\npersons. See O.C.G.A. § 37-3-162(a) and O.C.G.A. § 37-3-161.\n22.\nA person receiving court—ordered services for mental\nretardation is entitled to an individual program plan for\nappropriate care, training, education, habilitation and other\nneeded specialized services “written in behavioral terms” and\ncontaining, among other requirements, “a description of\nintermediate and long-range habilitation goals and a projected\ntime—table for their attainment” and “an explanation of criteria\nfor acceptance or rejection of alternative environments for\nhabilitation.” See O.C.G.A. § 37—4—40(c); O.C.G.A. § 37—4—2(9);\nChapter 290-4-6-.01(4)(i), Ga. Admin. Code.\n23.\nThere are identical provisions of state law requiring the\n8\n\ndevelopment of an individualized service plan for a mentally ill\nperson “specifically tailored to the individual’s treatment needs,”\nand including among other requirements “identification of the types\nof professional personnel who will carry out the treatment.”\n~\nO.C.G.A. § 37-3-64(c); O.C.G.A. § 37-3-1(9); Chapter 290-4-6-\n.01(4)(i), Ga. Adinin. Code.\n24.\nAmendments to the state law, effective July 1, 1994, provide\nthat the state office for mental health and mental retardation\nservices:\nis authorized to move funds to and\nbetween community and institutional programs\nbased on need\n. .\nO.C.G.A. § 37-2-5-1(c)(3). Those amendments provide further that:\nThe State of Georgia recognizes its\nresponsibility for its citizens who are\nmentally ill or mentally retarded to\n. . .\nmeet their needs through a coordinated system\nof community facilities, programs, and\nservices.\nO.C.G.A. § 37—2—1(a).\nFinally, the state law, “Community Services for the Mentally\nRetarded”, mandates community—based services when “deemed\nreasonably necessary by the Department (of Human Resources) to\nprovide for education, training, rehabilitation, and care of\nmentally retarded individuals.” See O.C.G.A. § 37-5-1 et~.\n9\n\nV.\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\n25.\nL.C. is a 27-year old African-American woman with mental\nretardation. In addition to mental retardation, she also has a\ndiagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. She is a\nfriendly person with a beautiful smile, genuine artistic talent,\nand a remarkable enthusiasm for writing words on paper.\n26.\nL.C. is disabled.\n27.\nL.C. has consistently been diagnosed with mild or moderate\nmental retardation; she has only very elementary ability to read\nand write a few words and a very limited ability to understand\nabstract concepts.\n28.\nL.C. is currently residing on an adult psychiatric unit at\nGeorgia Regional Hospital Atlanta (GRH-A), a facility owned and\n-—\noperated by the State of Georgia; she has lived most of her life\nsince age 14 at this facility and other institutions.\n29.\nGRH-A is a facility licensed and staffed to provide care and\ntreatment for persons with psychiatric illnesses. Its programs are\nprimarily designed to stabilize individuals during the acute phase\nof a mental illness so that ongoing mental health treatment can\nthen be continued in the community on an outpatient basis.\n10\n\n30.\nThe average length of stay for a patient at GRH-A is 21 days,\nbut L.C. has lived there for more than three years.\n31.\nGRH—A is a large institution with about 300 patients, divided\ninto various units or wards; each of the adult psychiatric units\nhas between 30 and 60 patients.\n32.\nThe unit where L.C. lives is called the “treatment unit”;\nit is a longer term unit for patients who remain hospitalized for\nseveral weeks or months. The average number of patients on the unit\nis 65.\n33.\nIn 1991, L.C. was placed in a community program for persons\nwith mental retardation arranged by a non—profit organization,\nProject Rescue, after many years of inappropriate psychiatric\ninstitutionalization at GRH-A from 1984 through 1991.\n34.\nL.C. lived quite successfully in that program for about one\nyear.\n35.\nIn May 1992, L.C. experienced a period of stress apparently\nrelated to a conflict with staff in the community program; she\nbegan expressing a desire to be hospitalized and began exhibiting\nsome aggressive and psychotic behavior.\n11\n\n36.\nIn May 1992, L.C. was hospitalized at GRH-A for treatment of\nher mental illness.\n37.\nAfter L.C. was hospitalized, another person moved into her\ncommunity residential “slot”.\n38.\nThe specific purpose of her admission to the hospital was to\nstabilize her psychiatric symptoms so that she could be returned to\na community setting as soon as possible. At that time, L.C.’s\nhospitalization was intended to be a brief period of inpatient\ntreatment.\n39.\nAt the time of her hospitalization, the hospital developed a\ntreatment plan which focused on the stabilization of her mental\nillness. As early as June, 1993, L.C. ‘s treating physician at GRH-A\nconcluded that the primary psychiatric treatment goal had been met.\n40.\nOnce L.C.’s condition had stabilized, she no longer needed to\nbe confined in an institution; she could have functioned from that\npoint in a more integrated, community setting with adequate\nsupervision.\n41.\nAs early as November, 1992, staff began to regularly note that\nL.C.’s condition remains the same or “unchanged.”\n12\n\n42.\nIn January, 1993, a social worker contacted “mental\nretardation services” for placement but there is no record of any\nresponse.\n43.\nIn March, 1993, L.C’s physician expressed his belief that\nbecause “she cannot live in the community without structure,” he\nmust “file for commitment.”\n44.\nIn April, 1993, L.C. ‘s physician noted that “placement remains\na problem” and the team nurse stated that she is “stable awaiting\nplacement.”\n45.\nIn July, 1993, L.C.’s physician was of the opinion that her\nneed for “constant structure” was the “main problem preventing from\nplacing her” and her nurse was of the opinion that she “remains the\nsame, has reached maximum level of functioning. Placement is\nprimary problem.”\n46.\nIn August, 1993, L.C.’s physician stated his belief that\nL.C.’s need for “constant reminder to keep her face clean” was a\nsignificant barrier to placement.\n47.\nIn September, 1993, L.C.’s social worker told her that he will\nassist her in finding a “personal care home” placement.\n13\n\n48.\nUp to the present time, Defendants have completely failed to\nplace L.C. in an appropriate community residential setting outside\nthe hospital.\n49.\nOnce L.C.’s psychiatric condition had stabilized, her primary\ntreatment and habilitation needs were related to her mental\nretardation. These needs could not be and were not adequately\naddressed at GRH-A.\n50.\nDuring the three years that L.C. has been confined in a mental\nhospital, no individualized habilitation program has been designed\nor implemented for her by qualified mental retardation\nprofessionals with training or experience in the habilitation of\nmentally retarded persons.\n51.\nFor the first two years of L.C. ‘s confinement at GRH-A and for\nmuch of the time during her previous years in the institution, she\nwould sit around in the day room areas doing nothing. From May,\n1992, through August, 1994, her primary activities consisted of\nseveral hours a day in a pre—vocational program on the hospital\ngrounds, a hygiene group and a communication group, each of which\nmet for a total of two or three hours each week.\n52.\n-\nBecause L.C. is in a mental hospital, the policies, standards,\nand regulations applicable to the appropriate habilitation of\n14\n\nmentally retarded persons in state, federal, and other publicly—\nfunded programs, such as those that govern the use of restraint,\nseclusion, medication, and the development and implementation of\nhabilitation plans, have not been followed by her treating\nprofessionals at GRH-A.\n53.\nUpon information and belief, none of the professionals on\nL.C.’s treatment team at GRH-A are qualified mental retardation\nprofessionals with experience or training in the habilitation of\nmentally retarded persons nor has L.C. been evaluated by any such\nprofessional on the hospital staff during her three years at the\nhospital.\n54.\nL.C.’s hospital record reveals many instances of the staff’s\ninappropriate responses to L.C., the absence of a consistent,\nprofessional approach to her behavioral problems, and a reliance by\nstaff on psychotropic drugs to manage behavior.\n55.\nThe record also reveals that the hospital staff was and is\nwithout basic information regarding both the capacity of mentally\nretarded persons to live in the community with proper support and\nthe capability of mental retardation community programs to deal\nwith L.C.’s behavioral deficits.\n56.\nFor example, L.C. was told that she cannot work unless she\n“keeps herself clean” and staff repeatedly commented that she takes\n15\n\nmany baths but does not wash properly. At the same time, her\ntreatment team decided that she must show an ability to work\nsuccessfully for an extended period of time before she can be\nconsidered for discharge. No professionally designed, consistent\nbehavior management plan was designed to help L.C. learn how to\nkeep clean.\n57.\nHospital staff often control L.C. with the administration of\nsedatives or psychotropic drugs when she is loud and disruptive,\nbut she has never been disruptive at the community day program\nwhich she began in August, 1994.\n58.\nIn the professional judgment of two mental retardation\nassessment teams in 1986 and 1988 as well as the two GRH-A treating\npsychiatrists responsible for L.C.’s care, as well as the nurses\nand social workers that have been on her treatment team since May,\n1992, long-term psychiatric hospitalization is inappropriate,\nunnecessarily restrictive, and does not meet her individual needs.\n59.\nIn the professional judgment of L.C.’s treatment staff and an\nindependent clinical psychologist, her long-term treatment and\nhabilitation must be conducted in a less restrictive and more\nappropriate setting in the community and not on an inpatient\npsychiatric ward.\n60.\nL.C.’s confinement on a locked ward in a mental hospital is a\n16\n\ndegree of restraint on her freedom which is inconsistent with the\nprofessional judgment of mental retardation evaluators and her\nhospital treatment staff concerning her appropriate treatment.\n61.\nDespite the professional judgment of L.C.’s two treating\nphysicians at GRH—A and other members of her treatment team at the\nhospital that L.C. should not continue to be confined in a mental\nhospital, it was and is the understanding and belief of all staff\ninvolved with her care that no alternative community residential\nplacements are available and that, for this reason, L.C.’s only\noption is to remain in the hospital.\n62.\nConfinement in a mental hospital is detrimental to L.C. She\npleads on a daily, sometimes hourly, basis to be released and\nexpresses great sadness, hopelessness, and frustration that another\nplace to live cannot be located. This level of anxiety about her\nsituation and uncertainty about her future interferes with her\nability to function.\n63.\nDuring the past three years, while institutionalized, L.C. has\nlost basic self-care skills, such as the ability to use the\nbathroom on her own without constant reminders.\n64.\nL.C.’s mental condition has remained essentially unchanged\nduring the past three years of confinement but her social skills,\nher self—care skills, her adaptive abilities, and her overall\n17\n\ncapacity to function in society have diminished.\n65.\nIn addition to the past three years, L.C.’s many previous\nyears of inappropriate institutional confinement during the period\nfrom 1985 through 1991 are a primary factor in her present need for\na structured and supervised community placement to assist her in\nthe transition to more independence.\n66.\nSince August, 1994, L.C. has participated in a community-based\nday program away from the hospital. In this environment, she has\nbegun to show progress in areas of functioning, such as social\nskills, activities of daily living, and the ability to express and\ncontrol emotion, which had remained essentially unchanged since\nher admission to GRH-A in 1992.\n67.\nMinimal habilitation for L.C. would consist of specialized\nprograms, training, and behavior management programs designed by\nmental retardation professionals to meet her individual needs.\n68.\nThe minimally adequate setting for L.C.’s long-term\nhabilitation is placement in the community.\n69.\nDuring the three years that L.C. has resided in the treatment\nunit at GRH-A, she has lived in an environment that is completely\nisolated and segregated from society; other than members of the\nhospital staff, she has virtually no contact with persons other\n18\n\nthan severely mentally ill persons in the acute phase of their\nillness.\n70.\nBecause L.C. lives in an institution with mentally ill\nindividuals, she has no opportunity to interact with non-disabled\npersons in daily activities and no opportunity to learn and\nmaintain skills that would enhance her ability to become more\nintegrated into society, such as riding a bus, shopping, cooking,\nand doing simple housekeeping tasks.\n71.\nThe state, through its county, regional, and contracted\nprivate providers operates a supervised, community—based\nresidential program for persons with mental retardation. The cost\nof placement in a such a program is substantially less expensive\nthan the cost of institutional care.\n72.\nThe hospital administration, the state office for mental\nretardation services, as well as the county and regional mental\nretardation programs, have been aware of L.C.’s need for community\nservices through many informal and formal efforts to secure these\nservices.\n73.\nBecause L.C. is both mentally retarded and mentally ill, she\nhas received lower priority for community placement than persons\nwhose diagnosis is exclusively mental retardation.\n19\n\n74.\nThere are existing vocational, habilitative, social, and\nresidential programs in the community operated fully or in part by\nthe Defendants with the necessary experience, qualified staff, and\nthe appropriate support and supervision to provide L.C. with the\nminimal habilitation that she needs in a much more integrated\nsetting than her present institutional placement.\n75.\nOne of these programs, TOPS, has assessed L.C. and would be\nwilling to place her in a supervised home or apartment setting\nthrough the “personal support” medicaid waiver program if the state\nor county would provide the requisite “match” to secure the federal\nmedicaid funds for implementation of an appropriate community\nhabilitation program for L.C.\n76.\nThe state and county have established many such placements\nwith similar arrangements for other mentally retarded persons.\n77.\nDuring the period that L.C. has been confined at GRH-A, she\nreceived a $14,000.00 lump sum Social Security payment in October,\n1992; she also receives a regular monthly Social Security\ndisability payment of $380.00.\n78.\nThe hospital, when informed of the lump sum payment, completed\nthe necessary forms to become L.C.’s payee so that the hospital\nwould have the authority to spend the money for L.C.’s benefit.\n20\n\n79.\nAfter becoming the payee for L.C.’s Social Security benefits,\nthe hospital then initiated a second procedure pursuant to state\nlaw which would permit the application of the lump sum and monthly\nbenefits to the cost of L.C.’s care at the hospital.\n80.\nThese actions of the hospital resulted in the application of\nall of L.C.’s funds toward the cost of her institutional care\nrather than toward the cost of a community alternative, with the\nexception of a small monthly allowance to purchase cigarettes and\na $5,000.00 burial fund.\n81.\nUpon information and belief, the hospital failed to submit a\nclaim for available medicare insurance coverage on L.C.’s behalf\nuntil recently when Plaintiff’s attorney raised concerns about the\nhospital’s application of all the funds available to L.C. for\nalternative placement to the cost of her institutional care.\n82.\nL.C. had a right to a hearing in the proceeding where the\nhospital became the payee for her Social Security benefits and in\nthe proceeding which resulted in the application of essentially all\nof her funds to her cost of care.\n83.\nAlthough notices regarding the procedures for requesting these\nhearings were received by the hospital, L.C. was not made aware of\nthese notices in either proceeding and no hearings were requested\n21\n\nor conducted on her behalf.\n84.\nAt all times relevant to this Complaint, Defendants have acted\nunder color of state law.\n85.\nDefendants’ actions have caused and are continuing to cause\nPlaintiff irreparable harm.\nVI.\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF\nCOUNT ONE ADA\n-\n86.\nDefendants have discriminated and are discriminating against\nPlaintiff on the basis of her disability in violation of Title II\nof the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et ~ and the ADA’s implementing\nregulations at 28 C.F.R. § 35.130.\nCOUNT TWO FREEDOM FROM UNDUE RESTRAINT\n-\n87.\nDefendants have violated and are violating Plaintiff’s right\nto be free from undue restraint, guaranteed to her by the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nCOUNT THREE RIGHT TO TREATMENT\n-\n88.\nDefendants have failed and are failing to provide Plaintiff\nwith treatment that is minimally adequate, in violation of her\nrights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n22\n\nCOUNT FOUR REGRESSION\n-\n89.\nDefendants have failed and are failing to provide Plaintiff\nwith the treatment and training that is necessary to prevent her\npre-existing skills from deteriorating as a result of her\ninstitutionalization, in violation of her rights under the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nCOUNT FIVE\nTREATMENT RELATED TO PURPOSE OF CONFINEMENT\n90.\nDefendants have failed and are failing to provide Plaintiff\nwith conditions of confinement that are reasonably related to the\npurpose of her confinement, in violation of her rights under the\nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nCOUNT SIX\nDEPRIVATION OF STATE-CREATED LIBERTY INTEREST\n91.\nDefendants have failed and are failing to provide Plaintiff\nwith individualized treatment in the least restrictive environment\nor otherwise provide Plaintiff with proper treatment mandated by\nstate law. Defendants’ failure to provide such treatment violates\nPlaintiff’s state—created liberty interest under the Due Process\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n23\n\nVII.\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF\n92.\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that this Court:\nA. Assume jurisdiction of this case;\nB. Declare that Defendants’ actions and failures to act as\ndescribed above violate the ADA, the Fourteenth Amendment\nto the U.S. Constitution, and 42 U.S.C. § 1983;\nC. Preliminarily and permanently enjoin the Defendants from\nfurther violating Plaintiff’s rights under the ADA, the\nFourteenth Amendment, and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and\nspecifically requiring them to:\n1. Cease discriminating against Plaintiff on the basis\nof her disability;\n2. Provide Plaintiff with appropriate habilitation,\ntraining services, and other treatment that comport\nwith professional standards for the treatment of\npersons suffering from mental retardation and\nmental illness including, but not limited to,\nrelease from GRH-A into a community care\nresidential program;\n3. Require that all habilitation, training services,\nand other treatment be provided by professionals\nqualified by education, training, and experience to\nprovide such services;\n24\n\n4. Provide Plaintiff individualized treatment in the\nleast restrictive environment with the ultimate\ngoal of integrating Plaintiff into the mainstream\nof society;\n5. Provide Plaintiff minimally adequate treatment to\nprevent deterioration of her pre—existing skills\nand that is related to the purpose of her\nconfinement;\n6. Cease unduly restraining Plaintiff’s freedom of\nmovement.\nD. Award Plaintiff costs and attorney’s fees; and\nE. Award any other relief the Court deems just and\nequitable.\n4~i.\n______________\nSUSAN C. JAM~IESON STEVEN D. ~ALEY\nGeorgia Bar ~o. 389408 Georgia Ba* No. 102866\n340 W.

The Eleventh Circuit's Decision Is Important.\nThe main point in the patients' responsive brief\nseems to be that this case really is not so important after\nall. For example, their very first argument is that the\npatients \"did not claim as stated by Petitioners\" that the\nAmericans With Disabilities Act (ADA) required the pro-\nvision of community-based treatment. (Resp. Brief, p. 1).\nYet the patients sought and obtained an injunction under\nthe ADA for exactly that result —community-basedtreat-\nment. By the patients' own estimates, these placements\ncost over $70,000 annually for each patient. (See Plaintiffs'\nBrief On Remand, Ex. 2). Their argument that they did\nnot claim they were entitled to this under the ADA defies\nlogic.\nSimilarly, they also argue that the State officials\n\"repeatedly misstate the court's holding as a finding that\ninstitutionalization constitutes 'discrimination per\nse'. . andassert without basis that the decision grants a\n'per se right to community placement.'\" (Resp. Brief, p.\n4). In spite of the patients' attempt to understate the\nimportance of this opinion, however, the record shows\nthat the Eleventh Circuit's interpretation of the \"integra-\ntion mandate\" is being wielded as a weapon throughout\nthe country, both by patients and by the Department of\nJustice, to force deinstitutionalization. For example, one\ndistrict court has ordered the discharge of as many as 256\npatients from institutions to community placements, rely-\ning on this case and on Helen L. v. DiDario, 46 F. 3d 325\n(3d Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 813 (1995). Kathleen S.\nv. Dept. of Public Welfare of Penn., 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS\n\n2\n11819, *1,*7 (E.D.Pa. 1998) (unreported). The Justice\nDepartment also is attempting to enforce the interpreta-\ntion of the Eleventh Circuit as a requirement on all states.\n(Amicus Brief of the States of Florida, et al., pp. 7, la to\n27a). This requirement would apply not only in the deliv-\nery of services to mentally ill and mentally retarded\npersons, but also in connection with services in nursing\nhomes.\nThe Eleventh Circuit's interpretation thus dramati-\ncally impacts not only Petitioners but all of the states. It\nhas caused confusion about the validity of the State's\nentire services-delivery system, and it has created uncer-\ntainty about the continued viability of the State's institu-\ntions. The budgetary impact could be enormous. This\nCourt should step in now and provide guidance on this\nimportant issue.\nII. The Patients' Procedural Arguments Should Be\nRejected.\nThe Respondents make two procedural arguments\nagainst the Court's considering this case. The Court\nshould reject both arguments, concluding instead \"that\nthe interests of judicial administration will be served by\naddressing the issue on its merits.\" Carison v. Green, 446\nU.S. 14, 17 n. 2 (1980).\nThe patients first argue that review should be denied\non the ground that the court of appeals' judgment is not\nfinal. Both the pertinent statute and this Court's cases,\nhowever, permit review of nonfinal judgments or pro-\nceedings. 28 U.S.C. § 1254(1) (1994); The Conqueror, 166\nU.S. 110, 113-14 (1897); see, e.g., United States v. General\n\n3\nMotors Corp., 323 U.S. 373, 377 (1945) (review granted for\ncase remanded by court of appeals for trial).\nIn the present case, the court of appeals affirmed the\ndistrict court's judgment, and yet it also remanded the\ncase for further proceedings. In practical effect, the court\nof appeals' decision is final, because it finally construes\nthe ADA and the integration regulation. The only job left\non remand is for the district court to adduce evidence on\nthe fundamental-alteration issue. Nothing that the district\ncourt can do now will obviate, correct, or alter the legal\nerror already committed by the court of appeals. This\ncase is ripe for review.\nThe patients' second procedural argument is that one\nof the questions presented (the constitutional issue) was\nnot raised adequately below. Initially, the State officials\nargued in the district court that the patients' position was\nclearly erroneous as a matter of statutory construction.\nOnly when the district court agreed with the patients on\nthe statute's meaning did the constitutional issue actually\narise. That issue is whether, if the district court's con-\nstruction of the statute, is right, the statute violates the\nConstitution.\nThe State officials did raise this issue expressly in\ntheir briefs in the court of appeals, as the patients\nacknowledge. (Resp. Brief, pp. 6, A-2). The court of\nappeals certainly could have addressed that issue if it had\nwanted to do so, once it approved the district court's\nconstruction of the statute. In any event, this Court is not\nprecluded from deciding issues that were not presented\nbelow. See, e.g., Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U.S. 868\n\n4\n(1991); Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 112-18 (1986);\nCarison, supra; Erie R.R. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 80-82\n(1938). This issue is of sufficient importance to warrant\nreview by this Court. Further, even if the Court declines\nreview of the constitutional issue, the statutory issue\nalone should be reviewed.\nIII. The Patients' Argument That There Is No Conflict\nAmong the Circuits Is Without Merit.\nThe patients' argument that there is no conflict\namong the circuits relies on their assertion that cases\ndecided under the Rehabilitation Act are irrelevant to a\nclaim under the ADA. (Resp. Brief, p. 8). This argument is\neasily answered.\nThis Court relied extensively on interpretations of\n§504of the Rehabilitation Act in a recent decision on the\nADA. Bragdon v. Abbott, —U.S. ._, 118 S.Ct. 2196, 141\nL.Ed.2d 540 (1998). Far from being irrelevant, the Court\nfound that prior administrative and judicial interpreta-\nlions of § 504 actually settled the meaning of the ADA.\n118 S.Ct. at 2207-08, 141 L.Ed.2d at 559-562 (1998).\nFurther, the legislative history and administrative\ncomments regarding Title II of the ADA repeatedly state\nthat it closely followed § 504. See, e.g., H.R.Rep. No.\n101485(111), 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 84 (1990) (\"The Com-\nmittee intends that title II work in the same manner as\n§504\");56 Fed.Reg. 33,694 (1991) (\"Because Title II of the\nADA essentially extends the nondiscrimination mandate\nof § 504 to those state and local governments that do not\nreceive federal financial assistance, this rule hews closely\n\n5\nto the provisions of existing § 504 regulations\"). The\ncourts have uniformly applied cases on §504to the ADA.\nSee, e.g., Helen L., supra, 46 F.3d at 330 n. 7 (\"The law\ndeveloped under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act is appli-\ncable to Title II of the ADA\"). For the patients to state\nthat this law is \"irrelevant\" is without merit.\nAdditionally, the patients argue that the regulation\nwas \"simply applied\" to the undisputed facts. (Resp.\nBrief, p. 11). They cite to isolated comments by the Attor-\nney General and also to another version of the integration\nmandate' in support of this argument. Yet neither these\ncomments nor the regulation even suggest, much less\nstate plainly, that the integration mandate applies to ser-\nvices and programs that are provided only to individuals\nwith disabilities.\nIV. The Constitutional Question Merits Review\nFinally, the patients have asserted that the constitu-\ntional question is not worthy of review. Two quick\nrejoinders apply here. First, even if the constitutional\nissue were not substantial, the statutory issue alone\ndeserves review. Also, the patients' devoting more than\nhalf of their responsive argument to the constitutional\nissue belies their assertion that the issue is unimportant.\nThe bulk of the patients' constitutional argument is\nan attempt to distinguish the present case from City of\nBoerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. ........,........, 117 S.Ct. 2157, 2159, 138\n1 The version of the integration mandate cited by the\npatients is not the one that was construed by the Eleventh\nCircuit. See Pet., 4a et seq.\n\n6\nL.Ed.2d 624, 638 (1997). Flores points out that, under\nSection 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, \"the line\nbetween measures that remedy or prevent unconstitu-\ntional actions and measures that make a substantive\nchange in the governing law is not easy to discern.\" The\nonly reply necessary now is that the patients' argument\nnot only fails to persuade on the merits but also, by its\nvigor, strongly supports the State officials' position that\nthe constitutional question is a substantial one.\nAnother branch of the patients' constitutional argu-\nment is that the Commerce Clause can provide support if\nthe Fourteenth Amendment fails as a foundation for Title\nII, the public-entities part of the ADA. The Clause cannot\nserve that function, however. First, the Eleventh Amend-\nment bars all suits for damages against the States based\non the Clause. Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 517 U.S.\n44, 55-73 (1996). That the present suit seeks injunctive\nrelief and pends against State officials rather than against\nthe State itself does not changethat rule here. The well-\nknown exception under Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123\n(1908), which authorized certain injunctive suits against\nstate officials, does not permit suits for injunctions where\nthe violations are not continuing and where state funds\nare to be used for redress of past wrongs. Green v. Man-\nsour, 474 U.S. 64 (1985); Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651\n(1974). In the present case, the patients sought State-paid\ncommunity placements — placements that the State pro-\nvided and continues to provide.\nNot only the Eleventh Amendment but also the Tenth\nAmendment may prevent the Commerce Clause from\nserving as a basis for Title II of the ADA. Of course, the\n\n7\nfederal government may enforce, against the states, com-\nmercial regulations that are equally applicable to govern-\nmental and nongovernmental activities. Garcia v. San\nAntonio Metropolitan Transit Auth., 469 U.S. 528 (1985).\nTitle H, however, applies expressly only to public entities,\nand it is sought to be enforced here by suit against State\nofficials. In New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144\n(1992),\nthis Court held that the Commerce Clause, being limited\nby the Tenth Amendment, provides no basis for Congress\nto order State governments to enact specific legislation or\nto take title to private property. In Printz v. United States,\n— U.S. 117 S.Ct. 2365, 138 L.Ed.2d 914 (1997), this\n.........,\nCourt held that, in light of the Amendment and other\nparts of the Constitution, the Clause does not permit\nCongress to require State or local executive officers to\nimplement federal law. Thus, the Tenth Amendment may\nwell bar the Commerce Clause's use as a foundation for\nTitle II of the ADA.\nRespectfully submitted,\nTHuItBucr E. BAicm 033887\nAttorney General\nKATHLEEN M.

(hereinafter \n\"Plaintiff\")  on  May  11,  1995,  seeking  a  community  placement  and \nalleging violations  of  her  rights  under  the Americans  With \nDisabilities Act  (hereinafter  \"ADA\"),  of  the  Due  Process \nClause,  and  of  her  State-created liberty interest.  Shortly \nthereafter,  on  June  16,  1995,  E.W.  (hereinafter  \"Intervenor\") \nfiled a  motion  to  intervene,  which  was  granted  in \nJanuary,  1996.  Like  Plaintiff,  Intervenor also  sought  a \ncommunity  placement  and  alleged violations  of  her  rights  under \nthe ADA,  the  Due  Process  Clause,  and  under  State  statutes. \n\nco, \n(\" \nNow,  over  a  year after  this  action was  filed and  twenty \nmonths  since  Intervenor was  hospitalized at  Georgia  Regional \nHospital  at Atlanta  (hereinafter  \"GRH-A\"),  Intervenor  filed a \nmotion  for  preliminary  injunction,  without  citing any  emergency \nor  significant  change  in her  circumstances  or  condition which \nwould  necessitate  filing  such  a  motion  at  this  time. \nIntervenor  is  simply attempting  to  gain preference  over  the \nmatters  already  on  the  Court's  docket  without  having  shown  any \nurgency  which  would  justify it. \nDefendants  believe  that  there  is  no  reason  for  this portion \nof  this  action  to be  addressed  in a  preliminary  fashion  at  this \njuncture  in  the  case.  The  parties  have  each  filed motions  for \nsummary  judgment,  which  should be  fully briefed and  ready  for \nconsideration within  a  few  weeks.  Those  motions  address  not \nonly  Intervenor's  claim  for  injunctive  relief under  the ADA, \nwhich  is  the  only  issue  raised  in  the motion  for  preliminary \ninjunction,  but  also  Intervenor's  claims  under  the  Due  Process \nClause  and  pursuant  to  her State-created liberty interests,  as \nwell  as  all  of  L.C.'s  claims.  The  relief being  sought  in all \nthese  claims  is  the  same  relief  being  sought  in this motion  for \npreliminary  injunction.  A  preliminary decision  could  foreclose \nthe  Court's  being  able  to  decide  this  action  on  its full  record. \nFurther,  the  motion  for  preliminary  injunction  is  not \nwarranted  on  its merits.  As  will  be  shown  below,  none  of  the \nfactors  which  would  allow  this  extraordinary  remedy  are  present \nin  this  case.  Therefore,  Defendants  urge  that  Intervenor's \nmotion  be  denied. \n-2-\n\nillIo  §1rA~ «})IF '1l.\"IHIIE CA§IE. \nA.  FACTS \nDefendants  will  not  attempt  to  respond  to  every  inaccurate \nfactual  statement  included  in  Intervenor's  brief.·  However, \nthree  statements  regarding  expert  opinions  are  incorrect  and \nrequire  a  response. \nFirst,  Intervenor  cites  extensively but  extremely \nselectively  from  Dr.  DeBacher's  evaluation  to  support  her \nposition  that Defendants'  professionals  believe  she  needs \ncommunity-based  rather  than  institution-based  services. \n(Intervenor's  Brief,  p.  3)  To  the  contrary,  however,  Dr. \nDeBacher  concluded  that  Intervenor  \"will  probably  require  a \nclosed,  inpatient  environment  in the  near  term\"  and  that  the \nhospital  had  provided  services  that  were  \"minimally adequate\" \nand  that  had  worked  with  other  similar patients  and  had  worked \nto  stabilize  Intervenor  in  the  past.  (Ex.  12  to  Intervenor's \nMotion,  pp.  5  and  7) \nSecond,  Intervenor  cites  to a  report  by  Dr.  Kaufman  (who \nevaluated  Intervenor at  her attorney's  request)  stating  that \n\"Dr.  Kaufman  also  concluded  that  E.W.  'needs  to  have  a  highly \nstructured  residential  home ...  Intervenor  omitted key \n'11 \nwords  from  Dr.  Kaufman's  report,  however,  which  state,  \"If  she \nis discharged  from  Georgia  Regional  she  needs  to  have  a  highly \nstructured residential  home.  \"  (Emphasis  added).  Thus, \nDr.  Kaufman  did  not  conclude  that  Intervenor needed  to  leave \nGRH-A  as  was  stated by  Intervenor. \n-3-\n\n( \nThird,  Intervenor  states  that  \"Joseph  Steed,  a  behavioral \nconsultant  with  the  Defendant  Fulton  County  Regional  Board  who \nis  responsible  for making  placement  assessments,  concluded  that \nE. W.  could  be  placed  in a  group  home-.  .  .  .\"  (Brief,  p.  5). \nIn  fact,  Steed  concluded  that  Intervenor  should  not  be  placed \nin  the  community  and  that  she  needed  to  remain  at GRH-A. \n(Affidavit  of  Pittman,  Ex.  A,  attached  to Defendants'  Motion \nFor  Summary  Judgment).  Further,  Intervenor  omitted any  mention \nof  the  opinion  of  Gloria  Sheppard,  a  member  of  the  Board's \nComprehensive  Evaluation Team,  who  concluded  that  Intervenor \nneeded  to  stay  in  the  hospital.  Id. \nBased  on  the  above  inaccuracies,  Intervenor  concluded  that \n\"the  weight  of  the  opinion\"  was  that  Intervenor  \"can  and  should \nbe  provided  an  appropriate  community  placement.\"  (Intervenor's \nBrief,  p.  6).  In  fact,  Dr.  DeBacher,  Joseph  Steed,  and  Gloria \nSheppard  concluded  that  she  should  not  be  placed  in  the \ncommunity.  Additionally,  Dr.  Patel,  a  board  certified \npsychiatrist who  treated  Intervenor,  concluded  that  she  could \nbe  placed  in  the  community  but  that  she  was  receiving  adequate \ntreatment  at GRH-A.  (Affidavit  of  Patel  attached  to \nDefendants'  Motion  For  Summary  Judgment  as  Exhibit  A).  It was \nonly Dr.  Elliott,  Intervenor's  retained expert,  who  now  states \nthat  she  should be  placed  in  the  community.  (See  report  of  Dr. \nElliott  filed by  Intervenor,  which  states  only  that  she  could \nhave  been  placed  in  the  community). \n-4-\n\n(  (' \nDefendants  rely  on  the  fact  submitted with  their Motion  For \nSummary  Judgment,  but  wish  to  highlight  the  following: \nGRH-A  is a  state hospital  in DeKalb  County  near Atlanta, \nGeorgia,  where  patients  with mental  illness,  mental  retardation \nand  substance  abuse  problems  are  treated.  At  the  times \nrelevant  to  this motion,  the  Treatment  Unit  at  GRH-A  was  a \n60-bed  psychiatric  unit  treating voluntary and  involuntary \npatients with  long-term and  acute mental  illness.  (Affidavit \nof  Patel,  p.  3,  attached  to Defendants'  Motion  For  Summary \nJudgment  as  Exhibit  A)  . \nOn  December  20,  1994,  Intervenor was  involuntarily admitted \nto  the  Treatment  Unit  based  in part  on  a  Form  1013,  which  is an \n\"Emergency  Admission  Certificate\"  signed  by  a  licensed \nphysician,  psychologist  or  clinical  social  worker.  The \ncertificate stated that  Intervenor appeared  to be mentally  ill, \nthat  she  had  auditory  and  visual  hallucinations,  was  paranoid, \nand  was  too  \"loose\"  to  care  for  herself.  Id.  at  Para.  10. \nOn  admission  to GRH-A,  she  was  examined  by  a  psychiatrist \nwho  stated  that  she  \"reports visual  hallucinations  (demons),\" \nand  also  that  she  \"reports  hearing  the  voice  of  her \ngrandfather. \"  Id.  at  Para.  1I. \nAt  the  times  relevant  to  the  Complaint,  Dr.  Dilipkumar \nPatel  was  the  Medical  Director of  the  Treatment  Unit  where \nIntervenor was  trea·ted.  He  is  a  Board  Certified Psychiatrist \nlicensed  to  practice  in Georgia.  Id.  at  Para.  2,  3. \n-5-\n\n(- ( \nDr.  Patel  diagnosed  her  as  having  a  Borderline  Personality \nDisorder  and Mild Mental  Retardation.  Id.  at  Para.  12. \nIntervenor  consented  to voluntary  treatment  on  December  30, \n1995.  A  treatment  plan was  developed  for  her  by  the  treatment \nteam,  including Dr.  Patel,  the  case  manager/social  worker, \nnurse,  activity therapist,  and  social  work ·supervisor.  Id.  at \nPara.  13. \nDr.  Patel  and  the  treatment  team  treated  Intervenor as  a \nvoluntary patient at  GRH~A.  In March,  in  response  to  a \ncomplaint  about  Intervenor's mental  retardation  services  from \nIntervenor's  attorney,  Dr.  Patel  consulted with  four  other \npersons  with  extensive  experience  in  treating persons  with \nmental  retardation.  Three  persons,  including  two  psychologists \nand  a  social worker,  were  from  the  Developmental  Learning \nCenter,  GRH-A's  Intermediate  Care  Facility For  the  Mentally \nRetarded  (ICF/MR).  They  concluded  that  Intervenor was  a  very \nchallenging patient  and  agreed with Dr.  Patel  that  the  mental \nretardation  component  of  her  diagnosis  did  not  appear  to be  the \narea  requiring  focused  treatment,  but  rather her personality \ndisorder.  Similarly,  the  Chief  of  the  Psychology Staff,  Dr. \nDeBacher,  concluded  that  Intervenor's behavior problems \nappeared mainly  related  to  her borderline  personality structure \nand  to  her depression and  not  to  insufficient mental \nretardation services.  Id.  at  Para.  17,  18. \nDr.  Patel  and  the  treatment  team  first  attempted  the \ntreatment  methods  in  the  Treatment  Plan,  including medication, \n-6-\n\n(  ( \nactivity therapy,  structure,  group  therapy,  hygiene  class,  and \nother  classes.  In Dr.  Patel's  opinion  this  treatment  was \nprofessionally acceptable  and  had  proved  successful  with  other \npatients  with  similar problems.  They  also attempted  to \ndischarge  Intervenor  to  the  community  to  personal  care  homes, \nwhere  other patients with  similar problems  have  been \nsuccessful.  Id.  at  Para.  13,  22. \nWhen  Intervenor's  mental  condition did  not  significantly \nimprove  and  when  she  repeatedly was  returned  from  placement  in \npersonal  care  homes,  other professionals  at  the  hospital \nsuggested  additional  professionally acceptable  choices  for \ntreatment,  and  her  treatment  plan was  adjusted at various  times \nto  try  to  address  her problems.  Id.  at  Para.  23. \nIntervenor's mental  condition and  her behavior  improved \nslowly  and  she  became  more  compliant  with  treatment.  These \nimprovements  make  it more  likely that  she  would  be  able  to  be \nsuccessful  in  the  community.  Id.  at  Para.  24. \nIn  Dr.  Patel's  opinion:  (1)  Intervenor's  treatment  at  GRH-A \nsince December  20,  1994,  has  been  adequate  and  appropriate  to \nher needsj  (2)  it is appropriate  to  treat a  patient  with  the \nlevel  of  severity of  problems  of  Intervenor  in a  hospital;  and \n(3)  it was  appropriate  and  professionally acceptable  for  her  to \nbe  at GRH-A.  Id.  at  Para.  27. \nDr.  Patel  is  competent  to make  the  treatment  decisions  he \nmade  for  Intervenor and  he  exercised his  professional  judgment \nand made  professionally acceptable  choices.  Id.  at  Para.  29. \n-7-\n\n(  ( \n; \nIt should be  noted  that  currently  Intervenor  is  being \ntreated at Grady Memorial  Hospital  for medical  problems. \nEarnestine  Pittman  is  the  Director  of  the  Fulton  County \nRegional  Board.  The  Regional  Board  is  responsible  for \nestablishing policy and  direction  for  disability services \nplanning,  delivery,  and  evaluation within  Fulton  County, \nO.C.G.A.  §  37-2-5(a),  which  is  Intervenor's  region.  (Affidavit \nof  Earnestine  Pittman,  Para.  2,  attached  to Defendants'  Motion \nFor  Summary  Judgment  as  Exhibit  B) . \nThe  regional  boards  are  also authorized by  the  legislature \nto  access  funds  which  are  appropriated  by  the  legislature  to \nthe Department  of  Medical  Assistance  (DMA)  ,  for matching \nfederal  funds  from  Medicaid  for providing  community  mental \nretardation  services.  These  are used  to  create Medicaid  waiver \nslots,  meaning  that  the  region  is authorized  to  serve  persons \nwith mental  retardation  services  in  the  community  under  the \nMedicaid  waiver  program.  Id.  at  Para.  4. \nThe  Medicaid  waiver  program  is a  primary  funding  source  in \nFulton  County  for  community  residential  services  for  persons \nwith mental  retardation.  Id.  at  Para.  5. \nThe  Fulton County  Regional  Board  does  not  currently have \nany  uncommitted Medicaid  waiver  funding  available  and  therefore \ncannot  provide  these  services  to  Intervenor under  that \nprogram.  The  funding  which  was  appropriated by  the  legislature \nto  DMA  for  the  Medicaid  waiver  program  for  the  Board  is being \nused  to provide  services  for  other disabled persons.  Id.  at \nPara.  6. \n-8-\n\n( \nThe  Board  does  not  currently have  sufficient  annualized \nunallocated  state  funds  available  to  provide  community \nresidential  mental  retardation services  to  Intervenor.  The \nstate  funds  which  have  been  appropriated  to  the  Board  for \ncommunity  retardation services  are  being  used  to provide \nservices  for  other disabled persons.  Id.  at  Para.  7. \nThe  Board,  through  its Comprehensive  Evaluation  Team  (CET), \nis  responsible  for  recommending  the  consumers  who  may  be  served \nunder  the Medicaid waiver  program  in  the  county.  The  CET  is \ncomposed  of  persons  with  special  training and  experience  in the \nassessment  of  needs  and  provision of  services  for  mentally \nretarded person.  Id.  at  Para.  8. \nThe  CET  evaluated E.W.  in March  of  this year  and \nrecommended  against  moving  her  from  Georgia  Regional  Hospital \nat  Atlanta  into  the  community.  Since,  as  stated above,  funding \nis  not  available,  the  CET's  recommendation  did  not  affect \nwhether  services  were  provided  to  E.W.  Id.  at  Para.  9. \nB.  GEORGIA8 S  STATUTORY  FRAMEWORK  FOR  PROVIDING \nDISABILITY  SERVICES \nIntervenor  is but  one  of many  persons  in Georgia  receiving \ndisability services  that  are publicly  funded.  In  this  State, \nthe  planning  and  delivery  of  mental  health,  mental  retardation, \nand  substance  abuse  services  are  accomplished  through  a \ncoordinated  system of  State,  regional,  and  community  agencies. \nThe  services  themselves  are  delivered  in a  broad  spectrum  of \nprograms  and  placements,  in State hospitals  and  other \n-9-\n\n( \ninstitutional  facilities  as  well  as  in  the  community.  See, \n~, O.C.G.A.  §§  37-1-2  (providing  for  a  \"comprehensive  range \nof  quality  services\"),  37-2-2(7)  (defining  \"hospital\"  as \nincluding  inpatient and  other  care),  37-2-S.1(c) (1) \n(authorizing  funding  for  hospitals  and  community  services), \n37-4-40  (providing  for  admission  to  a  facility  or  to an \nalternative placement),  37-5-3  (listing  some  types  of  community \nplacements) . \nState-wide  programs  and  State  facilities  for  these  services \nare  established and maintained by  the Department  of  Human \nResources,  acting  through  its Division  of  Mental  Health,  Mental \nRetardation,  and  Substance  Abuse,  which  was  ordained  by  statute \nin  1964.  O.C.G.A.  §§  37-1-20,  37-2-2.1.  The  Division also \nmakes  and  administers  budget  allocations  to  regional  mental \nhealth,  mental  retardation,  and  substance  abuse  boards \n(O.C.G.A.  §  37-1-20(b) (8);  establishes minimum  funding  amounts \nfor  each  regional  board  (§  37-2-5.1(c))i  and  establishes \nguidelines  for  the  regional  boards'  allocations  to  their \nrespective  community  service  boards  (§  37-2-S.1(c)). \nRegional  boards  were  created by  statute  in 1993.  O.C.G.A. \n§  37-2-4.1(b).  These  boards  administer  disability services \nwithin  their particular  region  of  the  State.  Each  region \nconsists  of  one  or more  counties,  and  each  regional  board \nconsists  of  members  from  each  county  within  the  region. \nO.C.G.A.  §§  37-2-4.1(a),  -5.  The  board  establishes  the  policy \nand  direction  for  disability services  within  its  region \n-10-\n\n( \n(O.C.G.A.  §  37-2-5(a),  exercises  \"responsibility and  authority \nwithin  the  region  in all matters  relating  to  the  funding  and \ndelivery of  disability services\"  (§  37-2-5.2(a) (2)),  contracts \nwith providers  for  these  services  (§  37-2-5.2(a) (5)),  and \nprepares  \"an  annual  plan and  mechanism  for  the  funding  and \nprovision of  all disability services  in  the  region.\" \n§  37-2-5.2 (a) (1) . \nCommunity  mental  health,  mental  retardation,  and  substance \nabuse  service  boards  were  also  created by  the  1993 \nlegislation.  O.C.G.A.  §  37-2-6.  Each  community  service  board, \nwhich  is  composed  of  members  appointed by  the  county  governing \nauthorities  within  the  community's  area  (O.C.G.A.  §  37-2-6(b)), \ngoverns  \"publicly funded  programs  by  providing  certain \ndisability services  not  provided by  other public  or private \nproviders  under  contract  with  the  regional  board.\"  (O.C.G.A. \n§  37-2-6(a)).  It may  make  contracts  for  the  provision of  such \nservices.  O.C.G.A.  §  37-2-6.1(b) (9). \nThus,  all  three  levels  of  government,  state,  regional,  and \ncommunity,  play  roles  in  the  delivery of  disability services. \nThe  regional  boards,  though,  perform at  least  two  of  the  most \ncritical  functions.  First,  they  control  the  flow  of  allocated \nfunds  generally: \nState,  federal,  and  other  funds  appropriated \nto  the  department,  the  division,  or both, \nand  available  for  the  purpose  of  funding  the \nplanning and  delivery  of  disability services \nshall  be  distributed  in accordance  with  this \nsubsection.  After July  I,  1995,  all  funds \n-11-\n\n(  ( \nassociated with  services  to  clients  residing \nwithin  a  given  region  shall  be  allocated \nthrough  the  appropriate  regional  board;  \"all \nfunds\"  shall  include  funding  for  hospitals, \ncommunity  service  boards,  private and  public \ncontracts,  and  any  contracts  relating  to \nservice  delivery  for  clients within  the \ngiven  region;  provided,  however,  that \nnothing  shall  prohibit  the  allocation of \nfunds  through  any  regional  board prior  to \nJuly  I,  1995. \nO.C.G.A.  §  37-2-5.1(c)  (emphasis  supplied);  see  also \n§  37-2-5.2 (a) (2),  supra,  (regional  board  controls  \"all matters \nrelating  to  funding\").  Second,  the  regional  boards  authorize \nwhich  individuals  receive  services;  these  boards  are  \"[t]o \nprovide,  as  funds  become  available,  for  client assessment  and \nservice  authorization and  coordination  for  each  client \nreceiving  services  within  the  region  or  funded  by  the  regional \nboard.\"  O.C.G.A.  §  37-2-5.2(a) (2)  (emphasis  supplied). \nThe  statements  about  fund  availability  in both  of  the  above \nprovisions  are  not  incidental;  an  individual's  right  to \nadequate  disability services  under  Georgia  law  is  limited not \nonly by  that  individual's  condition as  to disability but  also \nby  the  availability of  funds.  The  statute provides  elsewhere, \nfor  example,  that  \"the  department  through  the  division  shall, \nto  the  maximum  extent  possible,  allocate  funds  available  for \nservices  so  as  to provide  an  adequate  disabilities  services \nprogram available  to all  citizens  of  this  state.\"  O.C.G.A. \n§  37-2-II(a)  (emphasis  supplied).  Similarly,  the  statute \nprovides  that\" [t]he  division  shall  establish a  minimum  funding \namount  for  regional  boards  conditioned upon  the  amount  of  funds \n-12-\n\n( \nappropriated  and  a  supplemental  funding  formula  to be  used  for \nthe  distribution of  available  state  funds  in excess  of  the \nminimum  funding  amount.  O.C.G.A.  §  37-2-5.1(c) (1)  (emphasis \nsupplied) . \nFunding  availability also  has  a  direct  impact  on  individual \ncases.  An  individual's  access  to  services  is  governed  by \nO.C.G.A.  chapters  37-3;  37-4  and  37-5;  and  37-7.  These \nchapters  respectively  concern mental  health  services,  mental \nretardation services,  and  substance  abuse  services.  As  to \nmental  retardation services,  chapter  37-4  provides  that\" [a]ny \n~erson may  file  a  petition  for  a  court  ordered program  of \nservices  from  the  department  for  a  mentally  retarded  citizen of \nthis  state.\"  O.C.G.A.  §  37-4-40(a).  The  statute provides \nfurther  that  the  probate  court  must  review  the  petition and,  if \nit finds  reasonable  cause,  order  that  the  allegedly mentally \nretarded person be  examined  by  a  comprehensive  evaluation \nteam.  O.C.G.A.  §  37-4-40-b).  This  multidisciplinary team must \nexamine  the  person and  file  with  the  court  a  report  opining \nwhether  or not  the  person  is  retarded and  also  in need  of \nservices.  O.C.G.A.  §  37-4-40(c).  If  the  report  does  find  that \nthe  person  is  retarded and  needing  services,  the  court  holds  a \nfull  and  fair hearing  on  those  issues.  O.C.G.A.  §  37-4-40~d). \nIf  the  court  finds  at  the  hearing  that  the  person  is \nretarded  and  needs  community  (alternative)  services,  the  court \nmay  order  the  community  program  to be  provided  if such  an \nalternative program  is available and  if  it presents  a \n-13-\n\n( \nreasonable  expectation of  accomplishing  the  habilitation goals \nfor  the  person.  O.C.G.A.  §  37-4-40(e).  If  the  court  finds  that \nthe  person  is  retarded and  rrthat  the  least  restrictive \navailable  alternative which  would  accomplish  the  goals  of  the \nplan  is  for  the  client  to  be  admitted  to a  facility,\"  then  the \ncourt  may  order  such  an  admission,  but  only  if  the  court  also \nfinds  that \n(1)  The  client  requires  direct medical \nservices; \n(2)  The  client  needs  24  hour  training  in a \nresidential  care  facility;  and \n(3)  The  court  has  been  notified by  the \ndepartment  that  a  bed  appropriate  to \nthe  specific  needs  of  the  client  is \navailable  and  that  the  services \nindicated  in  the  individualized program \nplan  submitted  to  the  court  by  the \ncomprehensive  evaluation  team  or by  the \nclient  can  be  provided. \nId.  The  statute  carefully points  out  that  \"least  restrictive \nalternative\"  means  \"that  which  is  the  least  restrictive \navailable  alternative,  environment,  or appropriate \nhabilitation,  as  applicable,  within  the  limits  of  state  funds \nspecifically appropriated  therefor.  O.C.G.A.  §  37-4-2(b) (10) \nII \n(emphasis  supplied). \nThe  statutes  also make  clear that  the  power  to make \ndeterminations  as  to  the  availability of  funded  services \nresides  with  the  Department  and  the  regional  boards.  One \nexample  is  the  statutory provision  just  cited:  the  probate \ncourt may  not  order  services  to  be  delivered at  a  mental \n-14-\n\n(  ( \nretardation  facility unless  the  Department  notifies  the  court \nthat  a  bed  is available.  O.C.G.A.  §  37-4-40(e).  A  coordinate \nprovision defines  \"community  services\"  as  \"all  community-based \nservices  deemed  reasonably necessary by  the  department .... \" \nO.C.G.A.  §  37-5-3.  The  statute provides  that\" [t]he  division, \nin  compliance  with  the  provisions  of  the  appropriations  Act  and \nother applicable  laws,  is authorized  to move  funds  to  and \nbetween  community  and  institutional  programs  based  on  need \n.... \"  O.C.G.A.  §  37-2-5.1 (c) (3)  (emphasis  supplied) . \nRegional  boards  are  to prepare  annual  disability services  plans \nthat  include,  inter alia,  \"[a]  description  in  order  of  priority \nof  all proposed programs  and  disability services  to be  provided \nin  the  region,  and  the  funds  associated with  the provision of \nthes~ services  \"  O.C.G.A.  §  37-2-5.2 (a) (1) (E) . \nTo  summarize  this  part,  Georgia  statutes  establish a \nthree-tiered system of  administrative  agencies  to  deliver \ndisability services.  These  services  are  limited by  the \navailability of  funds  and  other  factors.  The  administrative \nagencies  make  the  discretionary decisions  that  are  inherent  in \nthe  allocation of  appropriated  funds  among  proposed  programs \nand  in  the  delivery  of  services  among  eligible applicants. \nC.  SUMMARY  OF  CONTROLLING  LAW  UNDER  THE  ADA \nIn  the  present  case,  the  substantive  law  that  controls  the \ndisposition  of  this motion  is  Title  II  of  the  Americans  With \nDisabilities Act  and  its  implementing  regulations.  It will  be \n-15-\n\n( \nhelpful,  prior to presenting argument  about  that  law,  to  fix \nclearly its purpose  and  parameters. \n1.  Purpose \nThe  purpose  of  the ADA,  insofar as  it is pertinent  to  this \ncase,  has  been  highlighted  in a  preamble  or  introductory \nremarks  published with  the  regulations.  The  preamble  states: \nSection  504  of  the  Rehabilitation Act  of \n1973  (29  U.S.C.  794),  which  prohibits \ndiscrimination  on  the  basis  of  handicap  in \nfederally  assisted programs  and  activities, \nalready  covers  those  programs  and  activities \nof  public  entities  that  receive  Federal \nfinancial  assistance.  Title  II  of  the ADA \nextends  this prohibition  of  discrimination \nto  include  all  services,  programs,  and \nactivities provided  or made  available  by \nState  and  local  governments  or any  of  their \ninstrumentalities  or agencies,  regardless  of \nthe  receipt  of  Federal  financial  assistance. \nPreamble,  printed at  56  Fed.  Reg.  35,  694,  et  seq.  (1991),  and \nas  Appendix A,  28  C.F.R.  Pt.  35  (1995)  at 448-9.  Even  more \nspecifically,  the  preamble  notes: \nThis  regulation  implements  subtitle A  of \nTitle  II  of  the  ADA,  which  applies  to  state \nand  local  governments.  Most  programs  and \nactivities  of  state and  local  governments \nare  recipients  of  federal  financial \nassistance  from  one  or more  federal  fudning \nagencies  and,  therefore,  are  already  covered \nby  section  504  of  the  Rehabilitation Act  of \n1973,  as  amended  (29  U.S.C.  794)  (\"section \n504\"),  which  prohibits  discrimination  on  the \nbasis  of  handicap  in  federally  assisted \nprograms  and  activities.  Because  Title  II \nof  the  ADA  essentially extends  the \nnondiscrimination mandate  of  section 504  to \nthose  state  and  local  governments  that  do \nnot  receive  federal  financial  assistance, \nthis  rule  hews  closely  to  the  provision of \nexisting  section  504  regulations. \n56  Fed.  Reg.  33,  694  (1991). \n-16-\n\n(  (\" \n2.  Texts \na.  Statute \nThe  text  of  the  ADA,  so  far  as  it is pertinent  to  the \npresent  case,  is quite brief.  Substantively,  that  text \nprovides: \nSubject  to  the  provisions  of  this \nsubchapter,  no  qualified  individual  with  a \ndisability shall,  by  reason  of  such \ndisability,  be  excluded  from  participation \nin or be  denied  the  benefits  of  the \nservices,  programs,  or activities  of  a \npublic  entity,  or be  subjected  to \ndiscrimination by  any  such  entity. \n42  U.S.C.  §  12132  (1995). \nProcedurally and  remedially,  the  text  (42  U.S.C.  §  12133) \nsimply  incorporates  the  \"remedies,  procedures,  and  rights\"  of \nthe  Rehabilitation Act  of  1973  (29  U.S.C.  §  794a),  which  in \nturn  incorporates  those  features  of  Title VI  of  the  Civil \nRights  Act  of  1964  (42  U.S.C.  §  2000d,  et  seg.).  Specifically, \nthe  last-naItJ.ed  act  provides  that a  \"State  shall  not  be  immune \nunder  the  Eleventh Amendment  of  the  Constitution of  the  United \nStates  from  suit  in  Federal  court  for  a  violation of  .  .  .  the \nprovisions  of  any  other Federal  statute prohibiting \ndiscrimination by  recipients  of  Federal  financial  assistance,\" \nand  that  legal  and  equitable  remedies  for  a  violation are \navailable  \"to  the  same  extent  as  such  remedies  are  available \nfor  such  a  violation  in  the  suit against  any  public  or private \nentity other  than  a  State.\"  These  provisions  are  echoed  in \nanother  section of  the ADA.  42  U.S.C.  §  12202  (1995). \n-17-\n\n(. \n( \nFinally,  the ADA  requires  the  Attorney  General  to promulgate \nregulations  \"that  implement  this part\"  no  later than  July \n25,  1991.  42  U.S.C.  §  12134(a)  (1995). \nb.  Regulations \nThe  pertinent  part  of  the  regulations  is 28  C.F.R.  35.130 \n(1995),  entitled  \"General  prohibitions  against \ndiscrimination.\"  It begins  with a  paraphrase  of  the \nsubstantive part  of  the  statute  (§  35.130(a»  and  then  states, \nsometimes  in great  detail,  five  elaborations  on  that  text.  One \nis  particularly pertinent  here,  and  that  is  the  shortest  of  the \nfive: \nA  public  entity shall  administer  services, \nprograms,  and  activities  in  the most \nintegrated  setting appropriate  to  the  needs \nof  qualified  individuals  with  disabilities. \n§35.130(d). \nThis  subpart  and  another  one,  §  35.130(b) (1) (iv»,  are \ndiscussed  in a  preamble  of  the  regulations,  part  of  which  is \ncontained  in Appendix  A  of  28  C.F.R.  Part  35.  The  preamble \nnotes  that  \"the  standards  adopted  in this  part  are  generally \nthe  same  as  those  required under  section 504\"  (App.  A  of  28 \nC.F.R.  Pt.  35  at  449)  and  then  states: \nMany  commenters  objected  to proposed \nparagraphs  (b(l) (iv)  and  (d)  as  allowing \ncontinued  segregation of  individuals  with \ndisabilities.  The  Department  recognizes \nthat  promoting  integration of  individuals \nwith  disabilities  into  the  mainstream  of \nsociety is an  important  objective  of  the ADA \nand  agrees  that,  in most  instances,  separate \nprograms  for  individuals  with  disabilities \n-18-\n\n(., \n( \nwill  not  be  permitted.  Nevertheless, \nsection 504  does  permit  separate programs  in \nlimited  circumstances,  and  Congress  clearly \nintended  the  regulations  issued under  title \nII  to  adopt  the  standards  of  section 504. \nFurthermore,  congress  included  authority  for \nseparate programs  in  the  specific \nrequirements  of  title III of  the  Act. \nSection  302(b) (1) (A)  (iii)  of  the  Act \nprovides  for  separate  benefits  in  language \nsimilar  to  that  in  §  35.130(b) (1) {iv),  and \nsection 302(b) (1) (B)  includes  the  same \nrequirements  for  \"the most  integrated \nsetting appropriate\"  as  in  §  35.130(d). \nApp.  A,  28  C.F.R.

THIS  INJUNCTION  FAILS  TO  MEET  THE \nELEVENTH  CIRCUITuS  MORE  STRINGENT \nSUBSTANTIVE  AND  PROCEDURAL  STANDARDS. \nA preliminary  injunction  is an  extraordinary and  drastic \nremedy,  United  States v.  Jefferson County,  720  F.2d  1511,  1519 \n(11th  Cir.  1983),  whose  sole  purpose  is  to preserve  the \nrelative positions  of  the  parties until  a  trial  on  the  merits \ncan  be  held.  University  of  Texas  v.  Camenisch,  451  U.S.  390, \n395,  101  S.Ct.  1830,  68  L.Ed.2d  175  (1981).  The  traditional \nstandards  for  granting preliminary  injunctive  relief,  which  are \napplied  in  this  Circuit,  are  that  the  movant  must  show  (1)  a \nsubstantial  likelihood that  she  will  ultimately prevail  on  the \nmerits;  (2)  that  she  will  suffer irreparable  injury unless  the \ninjunction  issues;  (3)  that  the  threatened  injury to  the movant \noutweighs  whatever  damage  the  proposed  injunction may  cause  the \nopposing  party;  and  (4)  that  if  issued,  the  injunction would \n-19-\n\nnot  be  adverse  to  the  public  interest.

Buckeye \nCellulose  Corp.,  856  F.2d  167,  169  (11th  Cir.  1988). \nIn  this  Circuit  and  the  Fifth Circuit,  however,  these \nstandards  are  applied more  stringently  than  in all  of  the  other \ncircuits,  in  that  in our  Circuit and  its progenitor,  the  movant \nmust  clearly carry  the  burden  of  persuasion  on  all  four \nstandards.

These  principles \nare  aptly  summarized  in a  Tenth  Circuit  case: \nIn addition,  the  following  types  of \npreliminary  injunctions are  disfavored  and \nthey  require  that  the movant  satisfy an  even \nheavier burden  of  showing  that  the  four \nfactors  listed above  weigh  heavily and \ncompellingly  in movant's  favor  before  such \nan  injunction may  be  issued:  (1)  a \npreliminary  injunction  that  disturbs  the \nstatus  quo;  (2)  a  preliminary  injunction \nthat  is mandatory  as  opposed  to prohibitory; \nand  (3)  a  preliminary  injunction  that \naffords  the  movant  substantially all  the \nrelief  he  may  recover at  the  conclusion  of  a \nfull  trial on  the  merits. \nA  preliminary  injunction that  alters  the \nstatus  quo  goes  beyond  the  traditional \npurpose  for  preliminary  injunctions,  which \nis  only  to  preserve  the  status  quo  until  a \ntrial  on  the  merits may  be  had  .... \nMandatory  injunctions  are more  burdensome \n-20-\n\n( \nthan prohibitory  injunctions  because  they \naffirmatively  require  the  nonmovant  to  act \nin a  particular way,  and  as  a  result  they \nplace  the  issuing  court  in a  position where \nit may  have  to provide  ongoing  supervision \nto assure  that  the  nonmovant  is  abiding  by \nthe  injunction  .  Finally,  a \npreliminary  injunction  that  awards  the \nmovant  substantially all  the  relief he  may \nbe  entitled to  if he  succeeds  on  the  merits \nis  similar  to  the  \"Sentence  first  -- Verdict \nAfterwards\"  type  of  procedure  parodied  in \nAlice  in Wonderland,  which  is an  anathema  to \nour  system  of  jurisprudence.  Thus,  in order \nto prevail  on  a  motion  for  preliminary \ninjunction where  the  requested  injunction \nfalls  into  one  or more  of  these  three \ncategories,  the  movant  must  show  that  on \nbalance,  the  four  factors  weigh  heavily  and \ncompellingly  in his  favor. \nSCFC  ILC,  Inc.  v.  VISA  USA,  Inc.,  936  F.2d  1096,  1098-9  (1991) \n(citations  and  footnotes  omitted). \nThe  procedural  aspects  of  preliminary  injunctions  are \ndetailed ,in Rule  65  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure. \nNo  preliminary  injunction  shall  be  issued without  notice  to  the \nadverse  party  (R.65(a) (1»,  and  typically  one  will  not  be \nissued without  a  hearing.  Baker,  supra.  Rule  65(c)  provides: \nNo  restraining  order  or preliminary \ninjunction shall  issue  except  upon  the \ngiving  of  security by  the  applicant,  in  such \nsum  as  the  court  deems  proper,  for  the \npayment  of  such  costs  and  damages  as  may  be \nincurred or  suffered by  any  party who  is \nfound  to  have  been wrongfully  enjoined  or \nrestrained.  No  such  security shall  be \nrequired  of  the  United  States  or  of  an \nofficer or agency  thereof. \nSecurity may  be  required  for  preliminary  injunctions,  where \nappropriate,  in virtually any  type  of  case,  including  ones \nraising  claims  of  discrimination.  See,~, Camenisch,  supra \n(§  504  claim). \n-21-\n\n(. \n( \nB.  INTERVENOR  IS  NOT  LIKELY  TO  PREVAIL  ON \nTHE  MERITS. \n1.  Intervenor Cannot  Show  That  She \nHas  Been  Denied A  Benefit  Or \nService  By  Reason  Of  Her \nDisability,  As  Required  Under  The \nADA. \nAs  stated in Part  II.C.2.a.  above,  the  pertinent  text  of \nthe  ADA  is quite  brief: \nSubject  to  the  provisions  of  this \nsubchapter,  no  qualified  individual  with  a \ndisability shall,  by  reason  of  such \ndisability,  be  excluded  from  participation \nin or be  denied  the  benefits  of  the \nservices,  programs,  or activities  of  a \npublic  entity,  or be  subjected  to \ndiscrimination by  any  such  entity. \n42  U.S.C.  §  12132  (1995)  (emphasis  added). \nIn  order  to  state a  claim,  then,  Intervenor must  show  the \nfollowing: \n1.  she  is  a  qualified individual  with a \ndisability; \n2.  she  was  denied  a  public benefit;  and \n3.  that  such  denial  of  benefits  or \ndiscrimination was  by  reason  of  her \ndisability. \nKornblau  v.  Dade  County,  86  F.3d  193  (11th  Cir.  1996). \nAs  to  the  first  element  of  the  claim,  the  ADA  defines  it as \nfollows: \nThe  term  \"qualified  individual  with a \ndisability\"  means  an  individual  with  a \ndisability who,  with  or without  reasonable \nmodifications  to  rules,  policies,  or \n-22-\n\nc-\npractices,  the  removal  of  architectural, \ncommunication,  or  transportation barriers, \nor  the  provision of  auxiliary aids  and \nservices,  meets  the  essential  eligibility \nrequirements  for  the  receipt  of  services  or \nthe  participation in programs  or activities \nprovided by  a  public  entity. \n42  USC  §  12131(2).  The  disability which  Intervenor  is  claiming \nin  this  case  is apparently mental  retardation  (Intervenor's \nBrief,  p.  3,  line  1,  and  p.  9,  para.  3;  Intervenor's  Complaint, \npara.  2,  5),  although  Intervenor also  refers  generally  to  her \nbehavioral/emotional  deficits  (Brief,  p.  4,  para.  2),  a \npersonality  change  (Brief,  p.  22,  para.  1),  and  a  IIvariety  of \nmental  disordersll  (Complaint,  para.  5).  For  the  purpose  of \nshowing  she  is disabled,  however,  Defendants  agree  that \nIntervenor  is mentally  retarded and  thus  disabled under  the  ADA. \nIn  regard  to being  IIqualifiedll  for  a  benefit,  Intervenor \nclaims  that  she  is  lIa  qualified  individual\"  under  the Act \nbecause  she  \"qualifies\"  for  the  community  services  she  seeks. \n(Intervenor's  Brief,  p.  22).  This  is  a  circular argument. \nFurther attempting  to  show  that  she  is  \"qualified,\"  she  merely \nstates  that  she  \"needs\"  a  community  placement  and  that  some \nprofessionals  believe  that with adequate  supports  she  could \nlive  in  one.  This  argument  falls  short  of  stating  that  she \nmeets  the  \"essential  eligibility requirements\"  for  a  program  or \nservices,  as  required under  the  ADA  cited above.  42  U.S.C. \n§  12131(2).  Nonetheless,  for  the  purpose  of  this motion, \nDefendants  agree  that  Intervenor may  be  able  to  show  that  she \nwould  meet  eligibility requirements  and  be  qualified  for \ncertain services  or programs  in  the  community. \n-23-\n\nr· \n( \nIntervenor  totally failed,  however,  to  allege  that  she  has \nbeen denied  services  in  the  community  by  reason  of  her \ndisability.  Her  claim  is basically that  she  is mentally \nretarded,  that  professionals  agree  that  her needs  can  be  met  in \na  community-based  program,  and  that  a  provider would  be  willing \nto  serve  her  if Defendants  will  pay  for  the  program.  Nowhere \ndoes  Intervenor allege  that  Defendants  are  refusing  to  fund \nsuch a  program  or  refusing  to place  her  in such  a  program by \nreason  of  her  disability. \nIn  considering  this  element  of  the  discrimination acts,  the \ncourts  have  most  typically considered  cases  in which  the \ndisabled plaintiff alleges  that  he  is  being  denied  a  benefit  or \nservice which  is  being made  available  to  others  who  are  not \ndisabled.  In  Southeastern Community  College  v.  Davis,  442  U.S. \n397,  99  S.Ct.  2361,  60  L.Ed.2d  980  (1979),  plaintiff had  a \nhearing  impairment  and  sought  admission  to  nursing  school, \nwhich  would  require  full-time,  personal  supervision whenever \nshe  attended  patients  and  elimination of  all  clinical  courses. \nThe  Court  found  that plaintiff's right  to be  integrated  into \nsociety  did  not  require  such  a  substantial  modification  of  the \ngrantee's  nursing  program.  Id. \nSimilarly,  in Alexander v.  Choate,  469  U.S.  287,  105  S.Ct. \n712,  83  L.Ed.2d  712  (1985),  plaintiffs were  Medicaid  recipients \nwho  challenged Tennessee's  reduction  in  the  number  of  days  that \nthe  state Medicaid  would  pay  hospitals  on  behalf  of  Medicaid \nrecipients.  The  Court  found  no  violation of  §  504,  even  though \n-24-\n\nCo \n( \nplaintiffs alleged  that  the  reduction  from  20  days  to 14  days \nwould  have  a  disproportionate  effect  on  the  handicapped. \nMany  other  cases  have  considered  the  claims  of  disabled \nr \npersons  alleging  exclusion  from  or denial  of  services by  reason \nof  their disability relative  to  non-disabled  persons. \nConcerned  Parents  To  Save  Dreher  Park  Center v.

For \nexample,  in Doe  v.

At  least  two  courts  have  held  that plaintiffs  stated a \ncause  of  action when  they  alleged  they were  excluded  from \ncommunity  programs  for  the  disabled based  on  the  severity of \ntheir disabilities.

Does  v.  Chandler,  83  F.3d  1150  (9th  Cir.  1996) i \nSandison v.  Michigan  High  School  Athletic Ass'n.,  Inc.,  64  F.3d \n1026  (9th  Cir.  1995);  Daniel  B.v.  White,  1991  W.L.  58494  (E.D. \nPa.  1991) i  and  Clark v.  Cohen,  613  F.  Supp.  684  (E.D.  Pa. \n1985),  aff'd on  other grounds,  794  F.2d  79  (3rd  Cir.  1986). \nFor  example,  the  Clark  Court  found  that  the  only  explanation \nfor  the  failure  to provide  plaintiff with  community  services \nwas  \"a  chronic  lack  of  funds  or bureaucratice misplacement  of \n-27-\n\nc \nplaintiff  over  the  years.  Id.  at  693.  Therefore,  the  lack of \na  placement  was  not  due  to  her disability and  there  was  no \n§  504  violation. \nIn  this  case,  Intervenor  has  not  alleged  that  she  has  been \ndenied  the  services  she  seeks  due  to  her  disability,  as \ncompared  to  other disabled persons  who  are  provided \ncommunity-based  services.  She  has  identified no  particular \ndisability,  or  combination  of  disabilities,  or  severity  of \ndisability as  the  basis  for  the  alleged discrimination. \nAlthough  she  states  that Defendants  have  \"discriminated\" \nagainst  her based  upon  her  disability~  she  does  not  state  that \nthey have  denied  services  to  her due  to  her  disability.  Since \nthe  only  \"discrimination\"  being  alleged  is  the  denial  of \nservices,  Intervenor must  show  that  the  denial  of  services  is \ndue  to  her  disability.  As  was  stated succinctly by  the  Seventh \nCircuit, \n(Plaintiffs)  appear  to  contend  that,  under \n(§  504),  (defendants)  had  the  affirmative \nduty  to  create  less  restrictive  community \nresidential  settings  for  them.  But  there  is \nno  contention  that  these  class members, \nbecause  of  their handicap,  are being  denied \naccess  to  community  residential  living  that \nIllinois  is  affording  to  others.  Thus, \ngiving  effect  to  the  plain meaning  of  this \nstatute,  (cit.  omitted),  it simply  has  no \napplication  to  (plaintiffs')  claim. \nPhillips v.  Thompson,  715  F.2d  365  (7th  Cir.  1983). \n-28-\n\n(  (. \n2.  Intervenor's  Reliance  On  The \n\"Integration Regulation\"  Is  Misplaced. \nIntervenor's  entire  claim  is based  on  the  rationale,  stated \nin Helen  L.  v.  Didario,  46  F.  3d  324  (3rd  Cir.  1995),  that  the \n\"integration  regulation\"  requires  the  State  to provide  services \nfor  her  in  the  community.  According  to  Intervenor,  \"the \nfailure  to  integrate  is discrimination Qy  itself\"  and  she  thus \nbypasses  the  requirement  in  the  ADA  that  a  plaintiff prove  that \nthe  State's  failure  to  provide  a  particular service  is  due  to \nher disability.  (Intervenor's  Brief,  p.  19).  This  argument  is \nflawed  for  several  reasons. \nFirst,  in  the  context  of  this  case,  Intervenor  is \nessentially arguing  that  the  integration  regulation mandates \ndeinstitutionalization,  whereby  everyone  who  could be  treated \nin  the  community  must  be  treated  in  the  community.  She  has  not \nclaimed  that  she  is being  denied a  placement  due  to  a \nparticular disability which  distinguishes  her  from  others \nreceiving  placements.  Thus,  she  is  simply  arguing  that  the \nState must  treat mentally  disabled persons  in community-based \nprograms  instead  of  in  institutionally-based programs. \nThis  argument  has  been  put  forth  often under  the  ADA  or \n§  504  but  has  rarely met  with  favor  by  the  courts.  As  stated \nabove,  the  Seventh  Circuit  held  that  §  504  did  not  require  the \nState  to  provide  community  residential  placements  for \ninstitutionalized plaintiffs,  as  plaintiffs had  contended. \nPhillips,  supra.  Similarly,  the  Sixth Circuit  has  held  that \n§  504  does  not  include  a  legislative mandate  for \n-29-\n\ndeinstitutionalization.  Kentucky Ass'n.  For  Retarded  Citizens, \nInc.  v.  Conn.,  674  F.  2d  582,  585  (6th  Cir.  1982),  cert. \ndenied,  459  U.S.  1041,  103  S.  Ct.  457,  74  L.ED.  2d  609  (1982). \nIn  this  Circuit,  in S.H.  and  P.F.,  supra,  the  district \ncourt  found  that  §  504  did  not  require  defendants  to provide \nhabilitation in  the  community  where  plaintiffs  could  not  show \nthat  they were  being denied  these  services  due  to  their \ndisability.  Other  courts  have  denied  plaintiffs'  contentions \nthat  §  504  or  the  ADA  mandated  deinstitutionalization.  Jackson \nv.  Fort  Stanton  Hosp.  and  Training  School,  964  F.2d  980  (10th \nCir.  1992);  Conner v.  Branstad,  839  F.  Supp.  1346  (S.D.  Iowa \n1993);  Daniel  B.  v.  White,  199  W.L.  58494  (E.D.Pa.  1991);  Clark \nv.  Cohen,  613  F.  Supp.,  684  (E.D.

Yet  neither  the \nexplicit  language  of  the ADA  nor  the  legislative history  call \nfor  or  require  deinstitutionalization of  mentally  retarded \nindividuals.  If  Congress  had  intended  such  a  radical  step,  it \nsurely would  have  clearly stated it. \nTo  the  contrary,  in  the  legislative history  of  the  ADA \nCongress  indicated that  it did  not  intend any  radical  departure \n-30-\n\n(  ( \nfrom  §  504.  Title  II of  the  ADA  was  intended  to  \"extend  the \nnondiscrimination policy  in  §  504  of  the  Rehabilitation Act  of \n1973  to  cover  all  State and  local  governmental  entities.\" \nH.R.Rep.No.  101-485(II),  101st  Cong.,  2d  Sess.  84  (1990), \nreprinted  in 1990  U.S.C.C.A.N.  267.  Again,  Title  II \n\"essentially simply  extends  the  antidiscrimination prohibition \nembodied  in  §  504  to  all  actions  of  state and  local \ngovernment.\"  Id.  at  367. \nFurther,  the  integration  regulation under  the  ADA  is \nsubstantially  identical  to  the  §  504  integration  regulation \nwhich  had  been  in effect  since  1981.  28  C.F.R.  §  35.130(d), \n28  C.F.R.  §  41.5(d)  (1981).  Thus,  Congress  did  not  intend  a \nsubstantive  extension of  §  504  to  include  entirely new  mandates \nsuch  as  deinstitutionalization.  Rather,  it simply  extended  the \nexisting  requirements  to additional  entities. \nThird,  the  regulations  do  not  define what  is meant  in 28 \nC.F.R.  §  35.130(d)  by  \"integration.\"  If  the  regulation meant \nthat  it was  no  longer  necessary  to  show  discrimination under \nthe ADA  or  that  the  ADA  required deinstitutionalization,  surely \nit would  have  said  so. \nIt  is anticipated  that  Intervenor may  argue  that  she  is  not \nseeking  deinstitutionalization,  but  as  was  contended  in \nHelen  L.,  simply  that  since  she  allegedly qualifies  for  a \ncommunity  program,  the  State's  failure  to  provide  her  treatment \nin  the  most  integrated setting appropriate  to  her  needs \n(without  a  proper  justification)  violates  the  ADA.  Helen  L.  v. \nDidario,  46  F.3d  325,  336  (3rd  Cir.  1995). \n-31-\n\n( \nOf  course,  in this  case,  unlike  in Helen  L.,  the \nprofessionals  did not  agree  that  Intervenor  should  leave \nGRH-A.  Joseph  Steed,  Dr.  DeBacher,  and  Gloria  Shepherd  all \nbelieved  that  she  needed  inpatient  care,  thus,  GRH-A  was  the \nmost  integrated setting appropriate  to  her needs. \nAdditionally,  Defendant  Pittman  stated that  there  were  no  funds \nto  provide  a  community  residential  placement  for  Intervenor and \nthat  existing  funds  were  being  used  to  service  other disabled \npersons. \nMore  significantly,  however,  this  distinction stated in \nHelen  L.  between  \"deinstitutionalization\"  on  the  one  hand  and \nproviding  services  \"in the most  integrated setting appropriate\" \non  the  other,  is  extremely  elusive  at  best,  and  in most \nsituations  is non-existent.  Further,  the  Helen  L.  Court \nrequires  the  state  to  justify its decisions  to  fund  a  certain \nmix  of  programs  and  services,  which  is generally beyond  the \nreach  of  the  federal  courts. \nAdditionally,  where  there  has  been  no  finding  or  allegation \nthat  plaintiff was  denied  services  due  to a  disability,  courts \nhave  not  applied  the  \"reasonable  accommodation\"  analysis  to  the \nstate's provision  of  services.  Conner,  supra;  Phillips,  supra; \nJackson,  supra;  SH  and  PF,  supra;  and  Daniel  B.,  supra. \nThe  Helen  L.  Court  alone  bypasses  the  requirement  under  the \nADA  that  plaintiff must  allege  that  she  has  been denied  a \nservice by  reason  of  her  disability.  Intervenor  cites  to \n-32-\n\nr· \n( \n\"Halderman v.  Pennhurst  State School  and  Hosp.,  784  F.  Supp. \n215,  224  (E.D.  Pa.  1992),  aff'd.,  977  F.2d  568  (3rd  Cir.  1992)\" \nto  support  her assertion  that  courts  other than  Helen  L.  have \nreached  this  conclusion.  (Intervenor's  brief,  p.  24).  Yet \nthis  citation  is erroneous,  because  the  Circuit  Court  affirmed \nthe  decision  of  the  district  court  on  other grounds  and \nspecifically did  not  reach  the  §  504  issue.  In  the  other  cases \ncited here  by  Intervenor,  the  courts  found  that  the  plaintiff \nwas  being  denied  a  benefit  or service  due  to  his  disability and \ndid not  base  the  decision  simply  on  a  failure  to  integrate. \nColeman,  supra;  Jackson,  supra;  and  Ga.  Assn.  of  Retarded \nCitizens v.  McDaniel,  511  F.  Supp.  126,  128  (N.D.  Ga.  1981). \nClearly,  it was  not  Congress'  intent  in  the  ADA  to mandate \nthat  states provide  services  for  the  disabled  in the  \"least \nrestrictive  environment.\"  To  the  extent  that  the  \"integration \nregulation\"  is  interpreted  to  require  such  a  result  it would \nexceed  the  scope  of  the ADA. \nC.  INTERVENOR  HAS  NOT  BEEN  IRREPARABLY \nHARMED. \nIt is  still viable  law  that  a  \"basic  doctrine  of  equity \njurisprudence  [is]  that  courts  of  equity  should  not  act,  and \nparticularly should  not  act  to  restrain a  criminal  prosecution, \nwhen  the  moving  party has  an  adequate  remedy  at  law  and  will \nnot  suffer  irreparable  injury  if denied  equitable  relief.\" \nO'Shea  v.  Littleton,  414  U.S.  488,  499,  94  S.  Ct.  669, \n38  L.Ed.2d  674  (1974)  (denial  of  injunction against \n-33-\n\n(  (. \n. \nprosecutions  alleged  to violate  civil  rights),  quoting  Younger \nv.  Harris,  401  U.S.  37,  43-44,  91  S.Ct.  746,  27  L.Ed.2d  669 \n(1971)  (same).  In  the  present  case,  Intervenor  seeks  a \nmandatory  injunction  forcing  the  defendants  to  discharge  her \nfrom  a  facility and  to pay  for  a  residential  and  habilitation \nplacement  in  the  community. \nEven  assuming  for  argument's  sake  that  Intervenor  is harmed \nby  her  current  situation,  however,  she  cannot  bear her  heavy \nburden  of  clearly showing  that  she  will  be  irreparably harmed. \nFor  each harm  claimed,  there  is an  adequate  legal  remedy,  and \nthis  is  so  even  if her  remedies  were  to  be  restricted  just  to \nthose  provided by  the  State's mental  health,  mental \nretardation,  and  substance  abuse  statutes. \nTo  the  extent  that  Intervenor  claims  that  she  is being \nharmed  by  her  continued  treatment  at GRH-A,  she  has  two  State \njudicial  remedies.  First,  as  a  voluntary patient,  she  or her \nrepresentative  can  request  discharge  and,  if the  chief medical \nofficer denies  her  request,  she  must  be  either involuntarily \ncommitted  or  released  through  a  probate  court  proceeding. \nD.C.G.A.  §  37-3-22.  Second,  whether  she  is voluntary  or \ninvoluntary,  she  or her  representative  could  file  in  the \nprobate  court  a  petition alleging  that  she  is being  unjustly \ndenied  a  right  or privilege granted by  the mental  health \nstatute  or  that  a  procedure  authorized  by  that  statute  is  being \nabused.  D.C.G.A.  §  37-3-148(b).  In both proceedings,  the \npatient  has  a  right  to  a  full  and  fair hearing,  including \n-34-\n\n(  ( \neffective assistance  of  counsel,  and  she  may  appeal  the  probate \ncourt's  decision.  O.C.G.A.  §§  37-3-1(8),-150. \nTo  the  extent  that  Intervenor  claims  that  she  requires \nmental  retardation services  in the  community,  she  or anyone \nelse  can  file  in  the  probate  court  a  petition to  receive  such \nservices.  O.C.G.A.  §  37-4-40.  Again,  the  petition is \ndetermined  by  the  court  upon  a  full  and  fair  hearing,  with  the \npatient  retaining  the  right  to  appeal  that  court's  decision. \nO.C.G.A.  §§37-4-2(7),-110.  Intervenor has  not  shown  that  she \nhas  utilized any  of  these  remedies.  She  thus  can  show  no \nirreparable  harm. \nD.  THE  BA.LANCING  OF  HARMS  AND \nCONSIDERATION  OF  THE  PUBLIC  INTEREST \nFAVOR  DENIAL  OF  THE  INJUNCTION. \nIn  the present  case,  the  balancing  of  harms  to  the \nrespective  parties and  proper  consideration  of  the  public \ninterest are  not  clearly separable  from  the  factors  already \ndiscussed.  The  harm  to Defendants  from  a  mandatory  injunction \nis that  the  State would  have  to pay  a  considerable  sum \n(including  possibly  capital  expenditures)  for  Intervenor's \ncommunity  placement,  just as  though  the  Court  had  entered a \nfinal  judgment,  and  regardless  of  an  ultimate  finding  that \nthere was  no  ADA  violation.  The  public  interest  is not  served \nby  the  expenditure  of  limited  funds  for  a  person  who  has  no \nlegitimate  entitlement  to  this  funds.  Nor  is  that  interest \nserved by  intrusion  into  the  discretionary  zone  entrusted by \nlaw  to  the  professionals  within  the  state administrative \nagencies. \n-35-\n\nc· \n( \nFor  the  above-stated  reasons,  Defendants  respectfully \nrequest  that  Intervenor's Motion  For  Preliminary  Injunction be \ndenied. \nRespectfully  submitted, \nMICHAEL  J.

Georgia.\nL.C., by Jonathan ZIMRING as guardian ad litem and next friend, Plaintiff,\nE.W., by Jonathan Zimring as guardian ad litem and next friend, Plaintiff-Intervenor,\nv.\nTommy OLMSTEAD, Director of the Department of Human Resources, et al., Defendants.\nCivil Action No. 1:95-cv-1210-MHS.\nMarch 26, 1997.\nORDER\nSHOOB, Senior District Judge.\n*1 This is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief brought on behalf of two mentally retarded persons, \nL.C. and E.W., who have been institutionalized in a state mental hospital. They allege that under rights granted them \nby the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, they are \nentitled to an order requiring the state to provide them care in the “most integrated setting appropriate,” which they \ncontend is a community-based treatment program rather than a state mental hospital. Before the Court are plaintiffs' \nand defendants' cross-motions for summary judgment as well as plaintiff E.W.'s motion for a preliminary injunction. \nThe Court's rulings are summarized below.\nBackground\nOn May 11, 1995, plaintiff L.C., a 27-year-old mentally retarded woman who has also been diagnosed as \nschizophrenic, filed this action challenging her continued confinement at Georgia Regional Hospital at Atlanta \n(“GRH-A”), a state mental institution. L.C. named as defendants the Commissioner of the Georgia Department of \nHuman Resources, the Superintendent of GRH-A, and the Executive Director of the Fulton County Regional Board, \nwhich is responsible for the provision of mental health and mental retardation services to residents of Fulton County.\nIn her complaint, L.C. alleged that, despite the professional judgment of her psychiatric treatment team that she \nno longer required in-patient psychiatric treatment but instead needed community residential and habilitation ser-\nvices, defendants had continued to confine her at GRH-A. L.C. alleged that her continued unnecessary confinement \nviolated her rights to freedom from undue restraint, minimally adequate treatment, freedom from illegal discrimina-\ntion, and placement in the most integrated setting appropriate to her needs, which were guaranteed by the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution and under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 \nU.S.C. § 12131 et seq. She sought declaratory and injunctive relief requiring, inter alia, that she be released from \nGRH-A into a community care residential program and provided with appropriate treatment by qualified profession-\nals.\nOn or about July 27, 1995, pursuant to a consent order entered in this action, defendants discharged L.C. from \nGRH-A to Brook Run, a state institution for treatment of the mentally retarded. On February 12, 1996, L.C. was re-\nleased from Brook Run to a community support program known as “Nyasha Hands.” However, L.C. contends that \nshe is not receiving appropriate services to support her in the community and is at high risk of having problems that \nwill cause her to be returned to GRH-A.\nMeanwhile, on January 29, 1996, the Court granted the motion to intervene as plaintiff filed by E.W., a 43-year-\nold mentally retarded woman who has also been diagnosed with a variety of mental disorders. Like L.C., E.W. al-\nleged that she was confined unnecessarily and inappropriately at GRH-A and sought release into a community-based \nresidential program.\n\n  Page 2\n*2 On July 12, 1996, plaintiff E.W. moved for a preliminary injunction directing defendants to release her from \nGRH-A to an appropriate, integrated community setting. On August 20, 1996, plaintiffs also filed a motion for sum-\nmary judgment. On August 22, 1996, defendants filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. The Court has de-\nferred a hearing on E.W.'s motion for a preliminary injunction pending a ruling on the parties' cross-motions for \nsummary judgment.\nSummary Judgment Standard\nUnder Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, summary judgment is appropriate when “there is no \ngenuine issue as to any material fact ... and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” In Celotex \n Corp. v. Catrett ,  477 U.S. 317, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) , the Supreme Court held that this burden \ncould be met if the moving party demonstrates that there is “an absence of evidence to support the non-moving \nparty's case.”  Id .  at 325 . At that point, the burden shifts to the non-moving party to go beyond the pleadings and \npresent specific evidence giving rise to a triable issue.  Id. ,  at 324 .\nIn reviewing a motion for summary judgment, the Court must construe the evidence and all inferences drawn \nfrom the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.  WSB-TV v. Lee ,  842 F.2d 1266, 1270 (11th  \nCir.1988). Nevertheless, “the mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an \notherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of \nmaterial fact.”  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. ,  477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) .\nThe Parties' Contentions\nPlaintiffs contend that defendants have unnecessarily institutionalized and segregated them in a mental hospital \nrather than placing them in an appropriate, integrated community setting, and that this constitutes unlawful discrim-\nination on the basis of their disability in violation of the ADA. Plaintiffs also allege that defendants have failed to \nprovide them minimally adequate treatment and habilitation and freedom from undue restraint in violation of their \nrights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\nDefendants contend that L.C.'s claims are moot because she is already being treated in an adequate community \nplacement. Defendants further argue that they have not violated E.W.'s rights under the ADA because she has been \ndenied community placement due to inadequate funding and not due to any discrimination based on her disability. \nFinally, defendants contend that they have not violated E.W.'s rights under the Due Process Clause because the de-\ncision to treat her at GRH-A rather than in the community was based on the exercise of professional judgment.\nDiscussion\n1. Mootness\n[1] After this lawsuit was filed, defendants placed L.C. in a community-based support program. However, due \nto a funding problem, L.C. did not receive the services intended to be provided through this program for at least sev-\neral months. While it appears that the funding problem has been resolved for now, given plaintiff's history of at least \neighteen prior hospitalizations at GRH-A and the questionable stability of her current placement, the Court finds that \nthere is a significant threat of L.C.'s being returned to GRH-A. The Court concludes that plaintiff's claims are not \nmoot because they are “capable of repetition, yet evading review.”  Sultenfuss v. Snow ,  35 F.3d 1494, 1498 n. 5 (11th  \nCir.1994); see also  Vitek v. Jones,   445 U.S. 480, 487, 100 S.Ct. 1254, 63 L.Ed.2d 552 (1980) ;  Lynch v. Baxley ,  744  \nF.2d 1452, 1457 (11th Cir.1984).\n2. ADA\n\n  Page 3\n*3 Title II of the ADA provides that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, \nbe excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, \nor be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132. To prove a violation of Title II, plaintiffs \nmust show: (1) that they are “qualified individual[s] with a disability”; (2) that they were excluded from participa-\ntion in or denied the benefits of some public entity's services, programs, or activities, or were otherwise discrimin-\nated against; and (3) that such discrimination was “by reason of” their disability. See Concerned Parents to Save \n Dreher Park Center v. City of West Palm Beach ,  846 F.Supp. 986, 990 (S.D.Fla.1994) .\nIn this case, there is no dispute that plaintiffs are qualified individuals with a disability. There is also no dispute \nthat plaintiffs can be placed in the community. As noted above, defendants have already placed L.C. in a com-\nmunity-based program. As for E.W., although defendants dispute whether she should be placed in the community, \nthe record demonstrates that the qualified experts are unanimous in their opinion that E.W. can be placed in the com-\nmunity, and defendants concede that E.W. qualifies for community-based services.FN1\nFN1. In a supplemental brief, defendants take the position that a recent medical problem experienced by \nE.W. precludes a community placement for her at this time. However, the evidence submitted by defend-\nants does not support this conclusion. The record establishes that E.W.'s medical problem has been resolved \nby surgery and does not prevent her being placed in the community.\n[2] Defendants argue, however, that plaintiffs have failed to prove the third element of their ADA claim, i.e., \nthat they have been discriminated against “by reason of” their disability. Defendants contend that plaintiffs have \nbeen denied community-based placements due to inadequate funding, not because of any discrimination based on \ntheir disability. The Court concludes, however, that under the ADA, unnecessary institutional segregation of the dis-\nabled constitutes discrimination per se, which cannot be justified by a lack of funding.\nFirst, it is clear from the statute itself that “segregation” of individuals with disabilities is a “form[ ] of discrim-\nination” that Congress intended to eliminate. 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(2), (3), (5). Indeed, the legislative history is re-\nplete with statements reflecting Congress's intent to prohibit unnecessary segregation of the disabled.FN2\nFN2. For example, Senator Harkin, floor manager of the ADA in the Senate, stated that the Act “guarantees \nindividuals with disabilities the right to be integrated into the economic and social mainstream of society; \nsegregation and isolation by others will no longer be tolerated.” 135 Cong. Rec. 19803 (1989). Plaintiffs \ncite numerous additional examples in their briefs.\nSecond, the regulations promulgated by the Attorney General to implement Title II plainly prohibit unnecessary \ninstitutionalization: “A public entity shall administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting \nappropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.” FN3 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d). The regulations also re-\nquire public entities to make reasonable modifications in existing programs in order to avoid discrimination: “A pub-\nlic entity shall make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are neces-\nsary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modi-\nfications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7).\nFN3. The “most integrated setting appropriate” is “a setting that enables individuals with disabilities to in-\nteract with non-disabled persons to the fullest extent possible ...” 28 C.F.R. Pt. 35, App. A.\n*4 Finally, in a similar case, the Third Circuit rejected an argument that continued institutionalization in a nurs-\ning home was justified by a lack of funding for an attendant care program that would permit the plaintiff to live at \nhome.  Helen L. v. DiDario ,  46 F.3d 325 (3rd Cir.) , cert. denied, 516 U.S. 813, 116 S.Ct. 64, 133 L.Ed.2d 26 (1995). \n\n  Page 4\nHolding that “the ADA and its attendant regulations clearly define unnecessary segregation as a form of illegal dis-\ncrimination against the disabled,”  id.   at 333  (footnote omitted), the court concluded that “since the Commonwealth \nhas chosen to provide services to Idell S. under the ADA, it must do so in a manner which comports with the re-\nquirements of that statute.”  Id .  at 339 .\n[3] In this case, defendants contend that all available funds are being used to provide services to other disabled \npersons. However, there is no dispute that defendants already have existing programs providing community services \nto persons such as plaintiffs. It is also undisputed that defendants can provide services to plaintiffs in the community \nat considerably less cost than is required to maintain them in an institution.FN4 Thus, defendants cannot demonstrate \nthat any fundamental alteration of their program is required in order to serve plaintiffs appropriately in the com-\nmunity. The fact that it may be more convenient, either administratively or fiscally, to provide services in a segreg-\nated manner does not justify defendants' failure to comply with the ADA.\nFN4. The record establishes that, on an annual basis, institutional care for the mentally retarded costs more \nthan twice as much as community care, and that the same is true for the mentally ill.\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court denies defendants' motion for summary judgment and grants plaintiffs' mo-\ntion for summary judgment on plaintiffs' ADA claim; declares that defendants' failure to place plaintiffs in an appro-\npriate community-based treatment program violates the ADA; permanently enjoins defendants from further violat-\ning plaintiffs' rights under the ADA; and orders defendants to comply with the ADA by releasing E.W. to an appro-\npriate, community-based treatment program and by providing L.C. with all appropriate services necessary to main-\ntain her current placement in such a program. In light of this ruling, the Court denies as moot plaintiff-intervenor \nE.W.'s motion for a preliminary injunction.\n3. Due Process\n[4] Plaintiffs also contend that their unnecessary institutionalization by defendants and defendants' failure to \nplace them in an appropriate community-based treatment program violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment, which guarantees them the right to minimally adequate treatment and freedom from undue restraint. \nSee  Youngberg v. Romeo,   457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982) ;  Wyatt v. Stickney,   334 F.Supp. 1341  \n(M.D.Ala.1971). It appears, however, that this claim is rendered moot by the Court's grant of summary judgment to \nplaintiffs on their ADA claim.\nFirst, having already determined that plaintiffs' continued institutionalization is unlawfully discriminatory under \nthe ADA, it is unnecessary for the Court also to decide whether plaintiffs' institutional care is minimally adequate or \nunduly restrains their freedom in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Second, insofar as plaintiffs seek as a \nremedy for defendants' alleged Fourteenth Amendment violation a discharge to an appropriate community-based \ntreatment program, the Court has already granted such relief in connection with the grant of summary judgment on \ntheir ADA claim. Finally, insofar as plaintiffs seek an order requiring defendants to provide them with appropriate \nhabilitation and treatment by qualified professionals to prevent deterioration of their pre-existing skills and with the \nultimate goal of integrating them into the mainstream of society, the Court has already granted such relief by order-\ning defendants to comply with the ADA by placing E.W. in an appropriate community-based treatment program and \nby providing L.C. all appropriate services necessary to maintain her current placement in such a program.\n*5 Accordingly, the Court denies as moot both plaintiffs' and defendants' motions for summary judgment on \nplaintiffs' claims under the Fourteenth Amendment.\nSummary\nThe Court GRANTS defendants' motion to extend time for filing defendants' motion for summary judgment [# \n\n  Page 5\n58-1]; DENIES IN PART and DENIES AS MOOT IN PART defendants' motion for summary judgment [# 61-1]; \nGRANTS IN PART and DENIES AS MOOT IN PART plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment [# 59-1]; and \nDENIES AS MOOT plaintiff-intervenor E.W.'s motion for a preliminary injunction [# 50-1].\nThe Court DECLARES that defendants' failure to place plaintiffs in an appropriate community-based treatment \nprogram violates Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq.; PERMAN-\nENTLY ENJOINS defendants from further violating plaintiffs' rights under the ADA; and ORDERS defendants to \ncomply with the ADA by releasing plaintiff-intervenor E.W. to an appropriate, community-based treatment program \nand by providing plaintiff L.C. with all appropriate services necessary to maintain her current placement in such a \nprogram.\nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58(2), the Court DIRECTS the clerk to enter a final judgment in \nthis action in the form of the preceding paragraph.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\nN.D.Ga.,1997.\nL.C., by Zimring v.

C 1188\n(Cite as: 138 F.3d 893)\nUnited States Court of Appeals,\nEleventh Circuit.\nL.C., by Jonathan ZIMRING as guardian ad litem and next friend; E.W., Plaintiffs-Appellees,\nv.\nTommy OLMSTEAD, Commissioner of the Department of Human Resources; Richard Fields, Superintendent of \nGeorgia Regional Hospital at Atlanta; Earnestine Pittman, Executive Director of the Fulton County Regional Board, \nall in their official capacities, Defendants-Appellants.\nNo. 97-8538.\nApril 8, 1998.\nPatients in state psychiatric hospital filed suit challenging their continued confinement in segregated environ-\nment. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, No. 1:95-CV-1210-MHS, Marvin H. \nShoob, J., 1997 WL 148674, granted summary judgment for patients. On appeal, the Court of Appeals, Barkett, Cir-\ncuit Judge, as a matter of first impression, held that: (1) Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Department of \nJustice's integration regulation prohibit state from confining disabled individual in state-run institution where that in-\ndividual could be appropriately treated in more integrated community setting; (2) confinement of patients in state \npsychiatric hospital in segregated environment violated ADA, despite State's claim of lack of funds; and (3) remand \nwas required for further proceedings on issue of whether requiring State to make additional expenditures would fun-\ndamentally alter the service it provided.\nAffirmed and remanded.\nBARKETT, Circuit Judge:\n [1]  [2]  Tommy Olmstead, Richard Fields, and Earnestine Pittman, (collectively “the State”), defendants in the \ndistrict court, appeal an adverse summary judgment granting declaratory and injunctive relief to plaintiffs L.C. and \nE.W.,FN1 two patients then-housed in a state psychiatric hospital. FN2 In May 1995, L.C. filed this action challenging \nher continued confinement at the Georgia Regional Hospital in Atlanta (“GRH-A”), a psychiatric hospital where \npersons with mental disabilities are cared for in a segregated environment. The State's failure to provide her with \ncare in the most integrated setting appropriate to her needs, she argued, violated Title II of the Americans with Dis-\nabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134 (1995), the Attorney General's Title II regulations, 28 C.F.R. § \n35.130 (1997), and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In January 1996, E.W., a patient also \nconfined at GRH-A, intervened in this action, raising identical claims.\nFN1. As the district court did, we use the pseudonyms L.C. and E.W. in order to protect plaintiffs' identit-\nies.\nFN2. Both L.C. and E.W. are currently being treated in community-based programs. L.C. was placed in a \ncommunity-based program in February 1996, while this action was pending in the district court; E.W. was \nplaced in a similar program after the district court entered its judgment. Nonetheless, this case is not moot. \nMootness has been defined as “ ‘the doctrine of standing set in a time frame: The requisite personal interest \nthat must exist at the commencement of the litigation (standing) must continue through its existence (moot-\nness).’ ”  United States Parole Comm'n v. Geraghty ,  445 U.S. 388, 397, 100 S.Ct. 1202, 1209, 63 L.Ed.2d  \n479 (1980) (quoting Monaghan,  Constitutional Adjudication: The Who and When,   82 Yale L.J. 1363, 1384  \n(1973)). As the district court concluded, L.C.'s suit falls under the exception for cases that are “capable of \n\n  Page 2\n138 F.3d 893, 8 A.D. Cases 1485, 12 NDLR P 192, 11 Fla. L. Weekly Fed. C 1188\n(Cite as: 138 F.3d 893)\nrepetition, yet evading review.” L.C. has been confined eighteen different times at the same psychiatric hos-\npital, GRH-A and her current placement has been unstable at times due to the State's failure to provide ad-\nequate funding. Therefore, it is likely that L.C. may be returned to GRH-A. Further, because of the com-\nplexity of the issues involved and instability of her placements, it is likely that any future claim for relief \nwill evade our review. See  Honig v. Doe,   484 U.S. 305, 318-23, 108 S.Ct. 592, 601-04, 98 L.Ed.2d 686  \n(1988);  Lynch v. Baxley ,  744 F.2d 1452, 1456-57 (11th Cir.1984) . As to E.W., because the State only placed \nher in a community-based treatment program under court order, it is likely that, absent the court order, the \nState might revert to its prior practices. See  Vitek v. Jones ,  445 U.S. 480, 486-87, 100 S.Ct. 1254, 1260-61 , \n63 L.Ed.2d 552 (1980). Further, like L.C., E.W. has been subject to multiple and unstable placements at \nGRH-A, making her claim one that is capable of repetition, yet evading review.\nIn granting summary judgment in favor of L.C. and E.W., the district court declared that the State's failure to \nplace them in an appropriate community-based treatment program, instead confining them at the state hospital, viol-\nates the anti-discrimination provision of Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and its accompanying regulations. \nThe district court enjoined the State from violating plaintiffs' rights under the ADA, determined that the denial of \ncommunity placements could not be justified by the State's purported lack of funds, and ordered the State to release \nE.W. to an appropriate community-based treatment program and to provide L.C. with all appropriate services neces-\nsary to maintain her current placement in a community-based treatment program.\nWe affirm the district court's judgment that the State discriminated against L.C. and E.W. by confining them in a \nsegregated institution rather than in an integrated community-based program. However, we remand this case to the \ndistrict court for further findings related to the State's defense that the relief sought by plaintiffs would “fundament-\nally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7).FN3\nFN3. The State also claims that it was entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs' constitutional claims. \nBecause the district court did not consider these claims, we decline to do so as well. Citro Florida, Inc. v. \n Citrovale, S.A. ,  760 F.2d 1231, 1232 (11th Cir.1985) .\nDISCUSSION\nThis case presents the question, one of first impression in this circuit, whether *896 § 12132 of the ADA and the \nDepartment of Justice's integration regulation, 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d), prohibit a state from confining a disabled indi-\nvidual in a state-run institution where that individual could be appropriately treated in a more integrated community \nsetting. The State's principal argument is that the district court's application of § 12132 and its accompanying regula-\ntions is contrary to the ADA's requirement that a plaintiff prove that he or she faced discrimination “by reason of \nsuch disability.” § 12132. The State contends that L.C. and E.W. have not shown that they were denied community \nplacements available to non-disabled individuals because of disability. In other words, the State argues that the ADA \nrequires a comparison of the treatment of individuals with disabilities against that of healthy non-disabled persons. \nHowever, as the State must concede, the confinement of L.C. and E.W. at GRH-A is attributable to their disabilities, \nthereby proving the very element the State argues is missing. Reduced to its essence, the State's argument is that \nTitle II of the ADA affords no protection to individuals with disabilities who receive public services designed only \nfor individuals with disabilities.\nThe State has not pointed to any legal authority that supports such a reading of Title II of the ADA and its integ-\nration regulation, § 35.130(d), and we can find none. To the contrary, we find overwhelming authority in the plain \nlanguage of Title II of the ADA, its legislative history, the Attorney General's Title II regulations, and the Justice \nDepartment's consistent interpretation of those regulations, to support L.C. and E.W.'s position.\nWe analyze the applicability of the ADA and its regulations first by discussing the plain language of Title II of \n\n  Page 3\n138 F.3d 893, 8 A.D. Cases 1485, 12 NDLR P 192, 11 Fla. L. Weekly Fed. C 1188\n(Cite as: 138 F.3d 893)\nthe ADA and § 35.130(d), the integration regulation, and the Attorney General's interpretation of that language. We \nthen consider, in light of congressional intent, the State's argument that, notwithstanding the plain language of § \n35.130(d) and the Attorney General's interpretation of that regulation, the ADA does not apply in these circum-\nstances. We next address the State's secondary argument that certain disputed issues of fact preclude summary judg-\nment. Finally, we consider the State's argument that funding limitations preclude it from complying with the ADA.\nI.\nTitle II of the ADA prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in the provision of public ser-\nvices by state and local governments. Section 12132 provides that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by \nreason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or \nactivities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.” § 12132.\nUnder the statutory scheme of Title II, Congress entrusted the Attorney General with the authority to define the \nscope of the prohibitions set forth in § 12132. In § 12134 of the ADA, Congress directed the Attorney General to \npromulgate regulations further defining Title II's anti-discrimination mandate. See 42 U.S.C. § 12134(a); H.R. Rep. \n101-485, pt. 3 at 52 (1990) (“[T]itle II does not list all the forms of discrimination that the title is intended to pro-\nhibit. Thus, the purpose of this section is to direct the Attorney General to issue regulations setting forth the forms of \ndiscrimination prohibited.”). Congress additionally mandated that the Attorney General's regulations, except with re-\ngard to program accessibility, existing facilities, and communications issues, be “consistent with this chapter and \nwith the coordination regulations under part 41 of title 28, Code of Federal Regulations ... applicable to recipients of \nFederal financial assistance under [section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act].” 42 U.S.C. § 12134(b).FN4\nFN4. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, in turn, provides that “[n]o otherwise qualified individual with \na disability in the United States ... shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from particip-\nation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving \nFederal financial assistance or under any program or activity conducted by any Executive agency or by the \nUnited States Postal Service.” 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (1995).\n[3] In response to this congressional mandate, the Attorney General issued regulations defining the forms of dis-\ncrimination *897 prohibited by Title II of the ADA. Because Congress left to the Attorney General the task of giving \nmeaning to § 12132's broad prohibition on discrimination in public services, the Attorney General's regulations must \nbe “given controlling weight unless they are arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.” Chevron, \n U.S.A., Inc. v. NRDC, Inc. ,  467 U.S. 837, 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2782, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984) ; Bledsoe v. Palm Beach \n County Soil & Water Conserv. Dist.,   133 F.3d 816, 822-23 (11th Cir.1998) ;  Harris v. H & W Contracting Co. ,  102  \nF.3d 516, 521 (11th Cir.1996);  Helen L. v. DiDario ,  46 F.3d 325, 331-32 (3d Cir.1995) .\n[4] Under the Attorney General's Title II implementing regulations, “[a] public entity shall administer services, \nprograms, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilit-\nies.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d). There can be little question that the plain language of § 35.130(d) prohibits a state from \nproviding services to individuals with disabilities in an unnecessarily segregated setting. See 28 C.F.R. Pt. 35, App. \nA at 478 (interpreting § 35.130(d) to require placement “in a setting that enables individuals with disabilities to in-\nteract with non-disabled persons to the fullest extent possible”). In participating in this and other similar litigation, \nthe Attorney General has consistently adopted this interpretation of § 35.130(d), and, as such, it is entitled to sub-\nstantial deference.  Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala,   512 U.S. 504, 512, 114 S.Ct. 2381, 2386-87, 129 L.Ed.2d 405  \n(1994);  University Health Servs., Inc. v. Health & Human Servs.,   120 F.3d 1145, 1150 (11th Cir.1997) .\n[5] By definition, where, as here, the State confines an individual with a disability in an institutionalized setting \nwhen a community placement is appropriate, the State has violated the core principle underlying the ADA's integra-\n\n  Page 4\n138 F.3d 893, 8 A.D. Cases 1485, 12 NDLR P 192, 11 Fla. L. Weekly Fed. C 1188\n(Cite as: 138 F.3d 893)\ntion mandate. Placement in the community provides an integrated treatment setting, allowing disabled individuals to \ninteract with non-disabled persons-an opportunity permitted only in limited circumstances within the walls of se-\ngregated state institutions such as GRH-A. The State does not seriously contend otherwise. Nor does it even attempt \nto show that the Attorney General's interpretation is “ ‘plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation’ ” as it \nmust to overturn her construction of § 35.130(d).  Thomas Jefferson ,  512 U.S. at 512, 114 S.Ct. at 2386  (quoting \n Udall v. Tallman,   380 U.S. 1, 16-17, 85 S.Ct. 792, 801, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965) ).\nBecause the express terms of § 35.130(d), supported by the Attorney General's consistent interpretation, plainly \nprohibit a state from treating individuals with disabilities in a segregated environment where a more integrated set-\nting would be appropriate, we can only reverse the district court's finding that the State's actions in this case consti-\ntuted discrimination within the meaning of the ADA by holding § 35.130(d) invalid. Thus, we turn to the State's ar-\ngument that § 12132's requirement that a disabled plaintiff prove that he or she faced discrimination “by reason of \nsuch disability” precludes application of the ADA in the circumstances presented here.\nII.\n[6] After review, we are unable to credit the State's argument that the ADA does not bar a state from providing \npublic services for individuals with disabilities in a segregated manner because every indication of congressional in-\ntent confirms that the ADA applies to the circumstances presented here. As noted earlier, in passing the ADA, Con-\ngress mandated that the Attorney General promulgate regulations consistent with the coordination regulations issued \npursuant to § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Congress' decision to incorporate the § 504 coordination regulations is \nparticularly significant here. The Attorney General's § 504 coordination regulations mandate that recipients of fed-\neral financial assistance “administer programs and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs \nof qualified handicapped persons.” 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(d) (1997) (emphasis added). By requiring the Attorney Gen-\neral to follow the § 504 coordination regulations-including the explicit integration requirement-Congress expressly \nmandated that individuals with disabilities *898 receive public services in the most integrated setting appropriate to \ntheir needs. Conforming to this mandate, § 35.130(d) tracks this very language.FN5\nFN5. In line with § 12134(b)'s mandate to promulgate regulations consistent with other parts of the ADA, \nthe Attorney General's Title II regulations are also consistent with the provisions of Title III. See 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12182(b)(1)(B) (1995) (“Goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations shall be \nafforded to an individual with a disability in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of the indi-\nvidual.”).\n[7] It is well-settled that where “a Congress that re-enacts a statute voices its approval of an administrative ... in-\nterpretation thereof, Congress is treated as having adopted that interpretation, and this Court is bound thereby.” \n United States v. Board of Comm'rs of Sheffield, Ala.,   435 U.S. 110, 134, 98 S.Ct. 965, 980, 55 L.Ed.2d 148 (1978) ; \n Don E. Williams Co. v. Commissioner,   429 U.S. 569, 576-77, 97 S.Ct. 850, 855-56, 51 L.Ed.2d 48 (1977) . Although \nTitle II of the ADA did not re-enact § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the plain language of the ADA makes clear that \nCongress ratified the Attorney General's § 504 coordination regulations and sought to ensure that the Attorney Gen-\neral's Title II regulations tracked the § 504 coordination regulations. Under these circumstances, both sets of regula-\ntions, including the integration provisions, have the force of law.  Helen L.,   46 F.3d at 332;  Messier v. Southbury \n Training Sch.,   916 F.Supp. 133, 141 (D.Conn.1996) .\nCongress' determination that public services be provided in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs \nof individuals with disabilities is likewise reflected in the ADA's congressional findings and the Act's legislative his-\ntory. The Act's findings and legislative history make clear that Congress sought to eliminate the segregation of indi-\nviduals with disabilities in passing the ADA. In enacting the ADA, Congress determined that discrimination against \nindividuals with disabilities persists in a wide variety of areas of social life, including “institutionalization,” 42 \nU.S.C. § 12101(a)(3) (1995), and that “individuals with disabilities continually encounter various forms of discrim-\n\n  Page 5\n138 F.3d 893, 8 A.D. Cases 1485, 12 NDLR P 192, 11 Fla. L. Weekly Fed. C 1188\n(Cite as: 138 F.3d 893)\nination, including outright intentional exclusion ... [and] segregation....” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(5); see also 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12101(a)(2) (“[H]istorically, society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, and ... such \nforms of discrimination against individuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem.”).\nIndeed, the legislative history makes clear that Congress considered the provision of segregated services to indi-\nviduals with disabilities a form of discrimination prohibited by the ADA. See S.Rep. No. 101-116 at 20 (1989) (not-\ning “compelling need to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate ... for the integration of persons with \ndisabilities into the economic and social mainstream of American life”); H.R.Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2 at 29 (1990), \nreprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 267, 310 (listing “segregation” as a form of “[d]iscrimination against people with \ndisabilities”); H.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 3 at 26 (1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 449 (“The ADA is a \ncomprehensive piece of civil rights legislation which promises a new future: a future of inclusion and integration, \nand the end of exclusion and segregation.”). Noting that “[t]he purpose of Title II is to continue to break down barri-\ners to the integrated participation of people with disabilities in all aspects of community life,” id. at 49-50, reprinted \nin 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 472-73, the House Committee on the Judiciary explained that “integrated services are es-\nsential to accomplishing the purposes of Title II.... Separate-but-equal services do not accomplish this central goal \nand should be rejected.” Id. at 50, reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 473. Indeed, drawing an analogy to the segreg-\nation of African-Americans, the House Report noted that “segregation for persons with disabilities ‘may affect their \nhearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone.’ ” Id. at 26, reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 448-49 (quot-\ning  Brown v. Board of Educ . , 347 U.S. 483, 494, 74 S.Ct. 686, 691-92, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954) ). Certainly, the denial of \ncommunity placements to individuals with disabilities such as L.C. and E.W. is precisely the kind of segregation that \nCongress sought to eliminate.\n*899 Accordingly, because § 35.130(d) finds direct support in the plain language of the ADA, its congressional \nfindings, and the Act's legislative history, we must apply it here. See  Bledsoe,   133 F.3d at 823  (deferring to ADA's \nTitle II regulations);  Harris,   102 F.3d at 521  (“We cannot disregard the interpretive guidance contained in the ap-\npendix prepared by the federal agency charged with enforcing the ADA, when that guidance is based on a permiss-\nible construction of the statute and is supported by the statute's legislative history.”).\n[8] We see nothing in the ADA's requirement that discrimination be “by reason of such disability” that warrants \na different result. The fact that L.C. and E.W. seek community-based treatment services that only disabled persons \nneed does not foreclose their claim that they were unnecessarily segregated. The ADA does not only mandate that \nindividuals with disabilities be treated the same as persons without such disabilities. Underlying the ADA's prohibi-\ntions is the notion that individuals with disabilities must be accorded reasonable accommodations not offered to \nother persons in order to ensure that individuals with disabilities enjoy “equality of opportunity, full participation, \nindependent living, and economic self-sufficiency ....” § 12101(a)(8); see  Willis v. Conopco, Inc. ,  108 F.3d 282, 285  \n(11th Cir.1997) (describing “the basic goal of the ADA” as “ensuring that those with disabilities can fully participate \nin all aspects of society”). This principle, explicit in the text of the Act's employment provisions in Title I, see 42 \nU.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A) (1995), and the Title II regulations, runs throughout the ADA. See  Bledsoe ,  133 F.3d at  \n820-25 (applying Title I reasonable accommodation mandate to Title II).\nFor example, under Title I of the ADA, employers may not terminate individuals with known disabilities who \ncan perform the essential functions of the job with a reasonable accommodation even though the employer need not \noffer similar accommodations to nondisabled employees. See  Harris ,  102 F.3d at 519  (noting that the ADA “oper-\nates to create an affirmative duty for employers to reasonably accommodate individuals with disabilities”); see also \n Sieberns v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,   125 F.3d 1019, 1021-22 (7th Cir.1997)  (noting that the “ADA encompasses two \ndistinct types of discrimination”: “treating a ‘qualified individual with a disability’ differently because of the disabil-\nity, i.e. disparate treatment” and “failing to provide a reasonable accommodation”). The employer's failure to live up \nto its duty to provide a reasonable accommodation is unlawful disability-based discrimination. See Stewart v. Happy \n Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc. ,  117 F.3d 1278, 1285 (11th Cir.1997)  (“[A] qualified individual with a disability \n\n  Page 6\n138 F.3d 893, 8 A.D. Cases 1485, 12 NDLR P 192, 11 Fla. L.

Dunlop Tire Corp.,   120 F.3d 1222, 1224 (11th Cir.1997)  (noting that the ADA \ndefines discrimination to include failure to make reasonable accommodations to a qualified individual with a disabil-\nity).\nHere, the Attorney General, guided by Congress' explicit approval of the § 504 coordination regulations, im-\nposed a duty analogous to the reasonable accommodation mandate in the employment setting. This duty requires \nstates to place individuals with disabilities in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs when receiving \nservices for their disabilities in order to ensure that they become integrated into communities, not isolated from the \nrest of our society in state-run institutions. Under § 35.130(d), the failure to provide the most integrated services ap-\npropriate to the needs of disabled persons constitutes unlawful disability-based discrimination-even though such ser-\nvices may not be needed by nondisabled individuals-because such segregation perpetuates their status as second-\nclass citizens unfit for community life. As the Third Circuit explained in holding that the unnecessary segregation of \ndisabled persons violates Title II of the ADA, “[t]he ADA is intended to ensure that qualified individuals receive \nservices in a manner consistent with basic human dignity rather than a manner that shunts them aside, hides, and ig-\nnores them.”  Helen L. ,  46 F.3d at 335;  see also *900 City of Cleburne, Tex. v. Cleburne Living Ctr. ,  473 U.S. 432 , \n461-64, 105 S.Ct. 3249, 3265-67, 87 L.Ed.2d 313 (1985) (Marshall, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) \n(surveying history of “segregation and discrimination” against mentally retarded persons).FN6\nFN6. Nothing in the Supreme Court's decision in  Traynor v. Turnage ,  485 U.S. 535, 108 S.Ct. 1372, 99  \nL.Ed.2d 618 (1988), is to the contrary. In Traynor, the Court held that § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act did \nnot impliedly repeal an Act of Congress permitting veterans to delay using their “GI Bill” educational be-\nnefits past the statutory time limit because of a disability that was not the result of their own willful miscon-\nduct. In upholding the willful misconduct limitation, the Court found “nothing in the Rehabilitation Act that \nrequires that any benefit extended to one category of handicapped persons also be extended to all other cat-\negories of handicapped persons,”  id.   at 549, 108 S.Ct. at 1382-83 , holding that Congress could choose to \ndeny the benefit to veterans “because they engaged in some degree of wilfulness in the conduct that caused \nthem to become disabled.”  Id .  at 550, 108 S.Ct. at 1383 . Here, the issue is not whether benefits accorded to \none group of disabled persons must be extended to all others, without regard to the individual's responsibil-\nity for the conduct that caused the disability, but whether a State may provide services to individuals with \ndisabilities in an unnecessarily segregated setting in the face of a clear congressional mandate requiring in-\ntegrated services. Nothing in Traynor requires us to validate the unnecessary segregation at issue here. See \n Helen L. ,  46 F.3d at 335-36;   Messier ,  916 F.Supp. at 142 n. 7;   Martin v. Voinovich ,  840 F.Supp. 1175, 1191  \n(S.D.Ohio 1993).\nFurther, the State's position is inconsistent with Congress' direction to promulgate regulations consistent with \nthe § 504 coordination regulations. These regulations impose a duty to provide the most integrated services appro-\npriate irrespective of any difference between services provided to individuals with disabilities and individuals \nwithout disabilities. Under the § 504 coordination regulations, no showing of differential treatment is required; the \nintegration regulation, on its face, applies to all services provided by a public entity. Significantly, Congress did not \nrequire the Attorney General to follow other agency regulations that require integration only where differential treat-\nment exists between individuals with disabilities and individuals without disabilities. See 45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(2) \n(1997) (Department of Health and Human Services) (requiring recipients of federal financial assistance from the \nagency to “afford handicapped persons equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to \nreach the same level of achievement [as nonhandicapped persons], in the most integrated setting appropriate to the \nperson's needs”); see also 34 C.F.R. § 104.4(b)(2) (1997) (Department of Education) (same). In making this choice, \nCongress decided that the unnecessary segregation of individuals with disabilities violates the ADA even absent a \nshowing of differential treatment between individuals with disabilities and nondisabled persons. The State's position \n\n  Page 7\n138 F.3d 893, 8 A.D. Cases 1485, 12 NDLR P 192, 11 Fla. L. Weekly Fed. C 1188\n(Cite as: 138 F.3d 893)\nwould effectively nullify Congress' choice to mandate the more demanding integration requirement contained in the \n§ 504 coordination regulations.\nFurthermore, a separate section of both the § 504 coordination regulations and the ADA Title II regulations pro-\nhibits a public entity from providing “different or separate” services to individuals with disabilities or a class of indi-\nviduals with disabilities from those provided to other persons unless necessary to provide qualified disabled indi-\nviduals with services “that are as effective as those provided to others.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(iv); 28 C.F.R. § \n41.51(b)(1)(iv). The State's claim that § 35.130(d) also requires a showing of differential treatment between disabled \nand nondisabled persons would render the prohibitions contained in § 35.130(b)(1)(iv) redundant-an interpretation \nwe must strive to avoid. See  Mackey v. Lanier Collection Agency & Serv., Inc. ,  486 U.S. 825, 837, 108 S.Ct. 2182,  \n2189, 100 L.Ed.2d 836 (1988) (declining “to adopt an interpretation of a congressional enactment which renders su-\nperfluous another portion of that same law”);  Cammarano v. United States,   358 U.S. 498, 505, 79 S.Ct. 524, 529, 3  \nL.Ed.2d 462 (1959) (rejecting construction of regulation that would render a phrase “pure surplusage”).\nMoreover, the State's interpretation of Title II would undermine the congressional intent to end the exclusion \nand segregation of individuals with disabilities, as expressed in § 12101 and the ADA's legislative history. In light of \nCongress' recognition that “discrimination*901 against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas \nas ... institutionalization,” § 12101(a)(3), the State's interpretation of Title II runs directly counter to Congress' stated \npurposes and must be rejected. See  McNely v. Ocala Star-Banner Corp. ,  99 F.3d 1068, 1074 (11th Cir.1996)  (reject-\ning interpretation of the ADA because it “cannot be reconciled with ... [the Act's] stated purpose”), cert. denied, 520 \nU.S. 1228, 117 S.Ct. 1819, 137 L.Ed.2d 1028 (1997). As the Third Circuit pointed out in Helen L., “[i]f Congress \nwere only concerned about disparate treatment of the disabled as compared to their nondisabled counterparts, this \nstatement would be a non sequitur as only disabled persons are institutionalized.” 46 F.3d at 336.\n[9] Further, while the State did not deny L.C. and E.W. community-based placements out of a malevolent intent \nto segregate them from the community, their indifference to L.C. and E.W.'s needs-manifested by their refusal to \nplace them in the community while recognizing the propriety of such a placement-is exactly the kind of conduct that \nthe ADA was designed to prevent. In  Alexander v. Choate,   469 U.S. 287, 105 S.Ct. 712, 83 L.Ed.2d 661 (1985) , sur-\nveying the legislative history of the Rehabilitation Act, the precursor of the ADA, the Supreme Court explained that \nCongress sought to do far more than merely outlaw invidious discrimination against the handicapped.\nDiscrimination against the handicapped was perceived by Congress to be most often the product, not of invidious \nanimus, but rather of thoughtlessness and indifference-of benign neglect. Thus, Representative Vanik ... described \nthe treatment of the handicapped as one the country's “most shameful oversights,” which caused the handicapped \nto live among society “shunted aside, hidden, and ignored.” ... Federal agencies and commentators on the plight of \nthe handicapped similarly have found that discrimination against the handicapped is primarily the result of \napathetic attitudes rather than affirmative animus.\n  Id .  at 295-96, 105 S.Ct. at 717  (footnotes omitted) (citations omitted). Indeed, Justice Marshall's opinion for the \nCourt made clear that “much of the conduct that Congress sought to alter in passing the Rehabilitation Act would be \ndifficult if not impossible to reach were the Act construed to proscribe only conduct fueled by a discriminatory in-\ntent.”  Id .  at 296-97, 105 S.Ct. at 718.  These same concerns underlie the ADA. “[T]he ADA attempts to eliminate the \neffects of that ‘benign neglect,’ ‘apathy,’ and ‘indifference.’ ”  Helen L. ,  46 F.3d at 335;  see also H.R.Rep. No. 101-\n485, pt. 3 at 50, reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 473 (“ ‘[T]he goal is to eradicate the invisibility of the handi-\ncapped.’ ”) (quoting  ADAPT v. Skinner,   881 F.2d 1184, 1204 (3d Cir.1989)  (en banc) (Mansmann, J., concurring in \npart and dissenting in part)). The State's failure to place L.C. and E.W. in the community thus falls squarely within \nthe ADA's ban on disability-based discrimination.\n\n  Page 8\n138 F.3d 893, 8 A.D. Cases 1485, 12 NDLR P 192, 11 Fla. L. Weekly Fed. C 1188\n(Cite as: 138 F.3d 893)\nNor do any of the cases cited by the State require a different conclusion. The State relies heavily on our en banc \ndecision in  S.H. v. Edwards ,  886 F.2d 292 (11th Cir.1989)  (en banc), as well as several cases decided by other cir-\ncuits, see  P.C. v. McLaughlin,   913 F.2d 1033 (2d Cir.1990) ;  Clark v. Cohen,   794 F.2d 79 (3d Cir.1986) ; Phillips v. \n Thompson,   715 F.2d 365 (7th Cir.1983) . But nothing in S.H. or these other cases remotely touches on the issues \npresented by this appeal. While it is true that we generally look to Rehabilitation Act precedents in construing the \nADA, see  Duckett,   120 F.3d at 1225 n. 1 , none of the cases cited by the State involved claims under the express in-\ntegration regulation of either the ADA or the § 504 coordination regulations, and therefore, those cases are inappos-\nite here. See  Helen L. ,  46 F.3d at 333-34  (distinguishing prior Rehabilitation Act precedent on this ground).\nIn S.H., for example, we considered “ ‘plaintiffs' claims for relief in the nature of habilitation in the least re-\nstrictive environment in accordance with the recommendation of professional treatment staff.’ ”  S.H. ,  886 F.2d at  \n293. S.H. did not involve the integration regulation of either § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act or the ADA, or a claim \nthat plaintiffs had been unnecessarily segregated. Instead, plaintiffs' only statutory claim was that they had been im-\npermissibly denied habilitation reviews. The district court denied *902 this claim, finding that the legislature's use of \na chronological bright-line to trigger habilitation reviews did not evidence discrimination solely because of disabil-\nity. See  S.H. v. Edwards ,  860 F.2d 1045, 1052 (11th Cir.1988)  (district court opinion attached as appendix A). It is \nfar from clear whether our two paragraph en banc decision even considered plaintiffs' Rehabilitation Act claim.\nFinally, we also reject the State's suggestion that L.C. and E.W.'s ADA claim must fail because the denial of \ncommunity-based placements was based on a lack of funds, not on L.C. and E.W.'s disabilities. Under the ADA, as \nunder Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, “the absence of a malevolent motive does not convert a facially discriminat-\nory policy into a neutral policy....”  International Union, UAW v. Johnson Controls ,  499 U.S. 187, 199, 111 S.Ct . \n1196, 1203-04, 113 L.Ed.2d 158 (1991). Even if the State failed to place L.C. and E.W. in the community because of \na lack of funding, this motive does not lessen the “discriminatory character” of their segregation. Id. Moreover, the \nplain language of the ADA's Title II regulations, as well as the ADA's legislative history, make clear that Congress \nwanted to permit a cost defense only in the most limited of circumstances. The ADA's Title II regulations permit a \nstate to justify its failure to make reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities where those accom-\nmodations “would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7).FN7 \nAs the House Judiciary report explained,\nFN7. We consider the applicability of this defense in part IV.\nThe fact that it is more convenient, either administratively or fiscally, to provide services in a segregated manner, \ndoes not constitute a valid justification for separate or different services under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation \nAct, or under this title.... The existence of such programs can never be used as a basis to ... refuse to provide an \naccommodation in a regular setting.\nH.R.Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 3 at 50, reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 473. The State's argument that its lack of \nfunds makes its refusal to provide integrated services non-discriminatory is inconsistent with the ADA's statutory \nscheme and would permit a public entity to justify its refusal to comply with the ADA by asserting that it lacked \nthe money to do so.\nWe emphasize that our holding does not mandate the deinstitutionalization of individuals with disabilities. In-\nstead, we hold that where, as here, a disabled individual's treating professionals find that a community-based place-\nment is appropriate for that individual, the ADA imposes a duty to provide treatment in a community setting-the \nmost integrated setting appropriate to that patient's needs. Where there is no such finding, on the other hand, nothing \nin the ADA requires the deinstitutionalization of that patient.\nIII.\n\n  Page 9\n138 F.3d 893, 8 A.D. Cases 1485, 12 NDLR P 192, 11 Fla. L. Weekly Fed. C 1188\n(Cite as: 138 F.3d 893)\nThe State also argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to E.W. because there is a dis-\nputed issue of fact regarding whether E.W. could be placed in a community-based treatment program. We review the \ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standards as the district court.  Harris,   102  \nF.3d at 518. Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, and affidavits show that no genuine is-\nsue of material fact exists for trial and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Celotex Corp. \n v. Catrett ,  477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) . We must view all evidence and all fac-\ntual inferences reasonably drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.  Harris,   102  \nF.3d at 519.\nThe State concedes that, at times during the course of this litigation, its own experts found that E.W. could be \nplaced in a community treatment program. However, it claims that because, at other times, those experts maintained \nthat E.W. should receive treatment in an institutionalized setting, a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether \ncommunity-based treatment was a possibility for E.W. In particular, the State points to the statements of Dr. Gary \nDeBacher, the *903 chief of the Psychology staff at GRH-A, Joseph Steed, a behavioral specialist with the Fulton \nCounty Regional Board, and Gloria Sheppard, a member of the Board's Comprehensive Evaluation Team. As the \nState argues, these experts found that E.W. could not be placed in the community at certain times during this litiga-\ntion. At the same time, however, these experts testified that a community-based placement would be appropriate for \nE.W. once her condition improved, so long as the community treatment program provided her with the necessary \nlevel of care and supervision.FN8\nFN8. The State also points to E.W.'s hospitalization at the Central State Hospital in Milledgeville, Georgia \nand at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta in late 1996 to support the conclusion that E.W. could not be \nplaced in the community. At that time, E.W.'s kidney functions were compromised, requiring surgery in the \nhospital. Although prior to the surgery, one of the State's experts, Dr. George Echols, was uncertain whether \nE.W. could be placed in the community after the surgery, the surgeon who performed the operation testified \nafter the surgery that E.W.'s medical problems did not require her to remain in a state hospital.\nIn light of the testimony and considering the record as a whole, we reject the State's argument that the district \ncourt's grant of summary judgment was in error. All the experts, including E.W.'s treating physician, were unanim-\nous that E.W. could be appropriately placed in a community-based treatment program, provided that it could give \nE.W. the level of care and supervision she needed. FN9 The State has not suggested that such placements were not \navailable to E.W. Indeed, they were able to find such a placement for E.W. after the district court's judgment.\nFN9. In early 1995, the experts at GRH-A themselves recognized that E.W. could be placed outside GRH-\nA. They repeatedly placed her in personal care homes, providing her with a community setting for her treat-\nment. She was not placed, however, in a community setting with the appropriate level of monitoring, and, \nas a result, she returned to GRH-A after extremely short stays in the community.\nWe do not suggest that should a trial court find that a patient, for medical reasons, needs institutionalized care, it \nmust nonetheless order placement in a community-based treatment program. We recognize that the determination \nwhether a patient can be appropriately placed in a community-based treatment program is a fluid one, subject to \nchange as the patient's medical condition improves or worsens. Over the course of litigation, there may be times that \na patient can be treated in the community, and others where an institutional placement is necessary. But where, as \nhere, the evidence is clear that all the experts agree that, at a given time, the patient could be treated in a more integ-\nrated setting, the ADA mandates that it do so at that time unless placing that individual would constitute a funda-\nmental alteration in the state's provision of services. Nothing in the ADA, however, forbids a state from moving a \npatient back to an institutionalized treatment setting, as the patient's condition necessitates.\n\n  Page 10\n138 F.3d 893, 8 A.D. Cases 1485, 12 NDLR P 192, 11 Fla. L. Weekly Fed. C 1188\n(Cite as: 138 F.3d 893)\nUnder these principles, the district court correctly denied the State's motion for summary judgment. Summary \njudgment is not precluded here by the fact that, at earlier times in the litigation, some of the State's experts opined \nthat E.W. could not be placed in the community immediately. None of the State's experts concluded that E.W. \nneeded to be placed at GRH-A on a long-term basis. At most, they believed that, in the short term, continued hospit-\nalization was necessary in order to permit E.W. to make the transition to a community-based living arrangement in a \ngroup home. Although one of the State's experts, Joseph Steed, expressed concerns that E.W. would not progress to \nthe point where she could be placed in the community, the evidence in the record shows that, in the spring and sum-\nmer of 1996-after Steed's initial assessment as well as the others cited by the State-GRH-A attempted to find a com-\nmunity placement for E.W., but could not because there were no available state Medicaid waiver funds for such a \nplacement.\nAccordingly, because the State's own professionals agreed that E.W. could be placed in a less segregated setting, \nthe State has failed to demonstrate that there is a material issue of fact for trial as required by *904Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. \nAccordingly, the grant of summary judgment was not in error.\nIV.\nIn Part II we rejected the State's argument that it complied with the ADA in this case because the denial of com-\nmunity placements to L.C. and E.W. was based on the State's lack of funds, not on plaintiffs' disabilities. We must \nnow address whether the lack of available funding provides the State a defense to plaintiffs' ADA claim.\nNotwithstanding that under the ADA and its Title II regulations the State has a duty to provide integrated ser-\nvices when the patient's care warrants such services, that duty is not absolute. As discussed above, the State need not \nprovide these services if to do so would require a fundamental alteration in its programs. Under Title II, “[a] public \nentity shall make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary \nto avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifica-\ntions would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7).\nL.C. and E.W. have demonstrated that the State may reasonably modify its provision of services by providing \ntreatment to them in an integrated setting. L.C. and E.W. point out that, under Georgia law, the State has the author-\nity to transfer funds between institutional and community-based treatment programs based on need. O.C.G.A. § 37-\n2-5.1(c)(3) (1995). They also note that, under the federal government's Medicaid waiver program, the State may \nspend Medicaid funds to provide community-based care to disabled persons who would otherwise be eligible for in-\nstitutionalized care. The federal government has authorized matching federal dollars for over 2100 patients in Geor-\ngia, but, in 1996, the State used only 700 of these slots. Finally, they argue that the State can provide integrated com-\nmunity-based services at significantly less cost than institutionalized care.\nThe availability of these alternate sources of funding makes L.C. and E.W.'s request for modification of the \nState's program of providing services to disabled persons a reasonable one “ ‘in the run of cases.’ ”  Willis,   108 F.3d  \nat 286 n. 2 (quoting  Barth v. Gelb ,  2 F.3d 1180, 1187 (D.C.Cir.1993) ). Accordingly, it is the State's duty to demon-\nstrate that providing treatment to L.C. and E.W. fundamentally alters the nature of the service it provides “ ‘in the \ncontext of the particular agency's operations.’ ” Id.;  Helen L. ,  46 F.3d at 337;  H.R.Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 3 at 51, re-\nprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 474 (noting importance of “size and budget” of the particular agency).\nThe State does not argue that the relief requested by L.C. and E.W. will effect a fundamental alteration by re-\nquiring it to dismantle its provision of institutionalized care to individuals with disabilities. Instead, the State argues \nthat it lacks the funds to provide community-based services to L.C. and E.W. The district court rejected this argu-\nment, reasoning that the State could provide community-based services to L.C. and E.W. at less cost than providing \ninstitutional care for them at GRH-A. Accordingly, it found that the State's purported lack of funds to provide com-\n\n  Page 11\n138 F.3d 893, 8 A.D. Cases 1485, 12 NDLR P 192, 11 Fla. L. Weekly Fed. C 1188\n(Cite as: 138 F.3d 893)\nmunity-based services to L.C. and E.W. was insufficient as a matter of law to establish that providing community-\nbased care to plaintiffs would constitute a fundamental alteration.\n[10] Under the ADA, as with other federal statutes, “[i]nadequate state appropriations do not excuse noncompli-\nance” with federal law.  Alabama Nursing Home Ass'n v. Harris ,  617 F.2d 388, 396 (5th Cir.1980)  ( Medicaid Act); \n see also Doe v. Chiles,   136 F.3d 709, 722 (11th Cir.1998)  (same);  Tallahassee Mem. Reg'l Med. Ctr. v. Cook ,  109  \nF.3d 693, 704 (11th Cir.1997) (same). Having chosen to provide services to individuals with disabilities, the State-\nboth the state officials charged with formulating the budget as well as the state agencies responsible for mental \nhealth services-must act “in a manner [that] comports with the requirements of [the ADA].”  Helen L.,   46 F.3d at  \n339.\nOur cases make clear that the ADA does not permit the State to justify its discriminatory treatment of individu-\nals with disabilities on the grounds that providing non-discriminatory*905 treatment will require additional ex-\npenditures of state funds. We recognized this principle in United States v. Board of Trustees for University of \n Alabama ,  908 F.2d 740 (11th Cir.1990) . There, we held that, considering the size of the University of Alabama's \ntransportation budget, the University failed to show that an additional expenditure of $15,000 to modify its bus sys-\ntem to reasonably accommodate individuals with disabilities would impose an undue financial hardship. The Uni-\nversity could not simply claim that it lacked the funds to make these modifications in its bus system; rather, it could \nonly justify its discriminatory treatment by demonstrating that its transportation budget could not be reasonably \nmodified to take account of the needs of the disabled. In light of its “annual transportation budget of $1.2 million,” \nwe concluded that requiring minimal additional expenditures of $15,000 would not “cause an undue financial bur-\nden on UAB.”  Id .  at 751 .\nThe district court did not consider whether treating L.C. and E.W. would require additional expenditures and if \nso, whether the State had met its burden of proving that those expenditures were unreasonable in light of the State's \nmental health budget. Instead, it noted that the State currently provided community-based services to individuals \nwith disabilities and that such services could be provided at less cost than segregated services. Based on these two \nfactors, the district court concluded that the State had failed to show that providing community-based care to L.C. \nand E.W. would cause a fundamental alteration.\nThere is evidence in the record that suggests that, because of fixed overhead costs associated with providing in-\nstitutional care, the State will be able to save money by moving patients from institutionalized care to community-\nbased care only when it shuts down entire hospitals or hospital wings, but not when it moves one or two patients \nfrom a hospital into the community. Thus, it may be that requiring the State to treat L.C. and E.W. in a community-\nbased program will require additional expenditure of state funds.\n[11] Nonetheless, the ADA may still require the State to expend additional funds in order to provide L.C. and \nE.W. with integrated services. Unless the State can prove that requiring it to make these additional expenditures \nwould be so unreasonable given the demands of the State's mental health budget that it would fundamentally alter \nthe service it provides, the ADA requires the State to make these additional expenditures. Because the district court \ndid not consider this question and because of the complexity of the factual issues concerning the funding for mental \nhealth services in Georgia, we remand this case to the district court for further proceedings on this issue. In determ-\nining whether the State can meet its burden of establishing a fundamental alteration, the district court should con-\nsider, among other things: (1) whether the additional expenditures necessary to treat L.C. and E.W. in community-\nbased care would be unreasonable given the demands of the State's mental health budget; (2) whether it would be \nunreasonable to require the State to use additional available Medicaid waiver slots, as well as its authority under \nGeorgia law to transfer funds from institutionalized care to community-based care, to minimize any financial burden \non the State; and (3) whether any difference in the cost of providing institutional or community-based care will \nlessen the State's financial burden.FN10 This list, is, of course, not exclusive. The district court may also consider any \n\n  Page 12\n138 F.3d 893, 8 A.D. Cases 1485, 12 NDLR P 192, 11 Fla. L. Weekly Fed.

We note that this case is not a class action, but a challenge brought on behalf of two individual \nplaintiffs. Our holding is not meant to resolve the more difficult questions of fundamental alteration that \nmight be present in a class action suit seeking deinstitutionalization of a state hospital.\nAccordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED and the case is REMANDED for further proceed-\nings consistent with this opinion.\nC.A.11 (Ga.),1998.\nL.C. by Zimring v.

SEfti 3 1996 \nFOR  THE  NORTHERN  DISTRICT  OF  GEORGIA \nATLANTA  DIVISION \n* \nL.C.  and  E.W.,  BY  JONATHAN \n* \nZIMRING,  as  guardian  ad  litem \n* \nand  next  friend, \n* \nPlaintiff,  * \n* \nv.  *  Civil  Action No. \n*  1:95-CV-1210-MHS \n* \nTOMMY  OLMSTEAD,  Commissioner \nof  the  Department  of  Human  * \nResources;  RICHARD  FIELDS,  * \nSuperintendent  of  Georgia  * \nRegional  Hospital  at Atlanta;  * \nand  EARNESTINE  PITTMAN,  * \n* \nExecutive  Director  of  the \nFulton  County  Regional  Board,  * \nall  in  their official  * \ncapacities,  * \n* \nDefendants.  * \nThis  case  was  filed by  Plaintiff L.C.  (hereinafter \n\"Plaintiff\")  on  May  11,  1995,  seeking  a  community  placement  and \nalleging violations  of  her  rights  under  the Americans  With \nDisabilities Act  (hereinafter  \"ADA\"),  of  the  Due  Process \nClause,  and  of  her  State-created liberty interest.  Shortly \nthereafter,  on  June  16,  1995,  E.W.  (hereinafter  \"Intervenor\") \nfiled a  motion  to  intervene,  which  was  granted  in \nJanuary,  1996.  Like  Plaintiff,  Intervenor also  sought  a \ncommunity  placement  and  alleged violations  of  her  rights  under \nthe ADA,  the  Due  Process  Clause,  and  under  State  statutes. \n\nco, \n(\" \nNow,  over  a  year after  this  action was  filed and  twenty \nmonths  since  Intervenor was  hospitalized at  Georgia  Regional \nHospital  at Atlanta  (hereinafter  \"GRH-A\"),  Intervenor  filed a \nmotion  for  preliminary  injunction,  without  citing any  emergency \nor  significant  change  in her  circumstances  or  condition which \nwould  necessitate  filing  such  a  motion  at  this  time. \nIntervenor  is  simply attempting  to  gain preference  over  the \nmatters  already  on  the  Court's  docket  without  having  shown  any \nurgency  which  would  justify it. \nDefendants  believe  that  there  is  no  reason  for  this portion \nof  this  action  to be  addressed  in a  preliminary  fashion  at  this \njuncture  in  the  case.  The  parties  have  each  filed motions  for \nsummary  judgment,  which  should be  fully briefed and  ready  for \nconsideration within  a  few  weeks.  Those  motions  address  not \nonly  Intervenor's  claim  for  injunctive  relief under  the ADA, \nwhich  is  the  only  issue  raised  in  the motion  for  preliminary \ninjunction,  but  also  Intervenor's  claims  under  the  Due  Process \nClause  and  pursuant  to  her State-created liberty interests,  as \nwell  as  all  of  L.C.'s  claims.  The  relief being  sought  in all \nthese  claims  is  the  same  relief  being  sought  in this motion  for \npreliminary  injunction.  A  preliminary decision  could  foreclose \nthe  Court's  being  able  to  decide  this  action  on  its full  record. \nFurther,  the  motion  for  preliminary  injunction  is  not \nwarranted  on  its merits.  As  will  be  shown  below,  none  of  the \nfactors  which  would  allow  this  extraordinary  remedy  are  present \nin  this  case.  Therefore,  Defendants  urge  that  Intervenor's \nmotion  be  denied. \n-2-\n\nillIo  §1rA~ «})IF '1l.\"IHIIE CA§IE. \nA.  FACTS \nDefendants  will  not  attempt  to  respond  to  every  inaccurate \nfactual  statement  included  in  Intervenor's  brief.·  However, \nthree  statements  regarding  expert  opinions  are  incorrect  and \nrequire  a  response. \nFirst,  Intervenor  cites  extensively but  extremely \nselectively  from  Dr.  DeBacher's  evaluation  to  support  her \nposition  that Defendants'  professionals  believe  she  needs \ncommunity-based  rather  than  institution-based  services. \n(Intervenor's  Brief,  p.  3)  To  the  contrary,  however,  Dr. \nDeBacher  concluded  that  Intervenor  \"will  probably  require  a \nclosed,  inpatient  environment  in the  near  term\"  and  that  the \nhospital  had  provided  services  that  were  \"minimally adequate\" \nand  that  had  worked  with  other  similar patients  and  had  worked \nto  stabilize  Intervenor  in  the  past.  (Ex.  12  to  Intervenor's \nMotion,  pp.  5  and  7) \nSecond,  Intervenor  cites  to a  report  by  Dr.  Kaufman  (who \nevaluated  Intervenor at  her attorney's  request)  stating  that \n\"Dr.  Kaufman  also  concluded  that  E.W.  'needs  to  have  a  highly \nstructured  residential  home ...  Intervenor  omitted key \n'11 \nwords  from  Dr.  Kaufman's  report,  however,  which  state,  \"If  she \nis discharged  from  Georgia  Regional  she  needs  to  have  a  highly \nstructured residential  home.  \"  (Emphasis  added).  Thus, \nDr.  Kaufman  did  not  conclude  that  Intervenor needed  to  leave \nGRH-A  as  was  stated by  Intervenor. \n-3-\n\n( \nThird,  Intervenor  states  that  \"Joseph  Steed,  a  behavioral \nconsultant  with  the  Defendant  Fulton  County  Regional  Board  who \nis  responsible  for making  placement  assessments,  concluded  that \nE. W.  could  be  placed  in a  group  home-.  .  .  .\"  (Brief,  p.  5). \nIn  fact,  Steed  concluded  that  Intervenor  should  not  be  placed \nin  the  community  and  that  she  needed  to  remain  at GRH-A. \n(Affidavit  of  Pittman,  Ex.  A,  attached  to Defendants'  Motion \nFor  Summary  Judgment).  Further,  Intervenor  omitted any  mention \nof  the  opinion  of  Gloria  Sheppard,  a  member  of  the  Board's \nComprehensive  Evaluation Team,  who  concluded  that  Intervenor \nneeded  to  stay  in  the  hospital.  Id. \nBased  on  the  above  inaccuracies,  Intervenor  concluded  that \n\"the  weight  of  the  opinion\"  was  that  Intervenor  \"can  and  should \nbe  provided  an  appropriate  community  placement.\"  (Intervenor's \nBrief,  p.  6).  In  fact,  Dr.  DeBacher,  Joseph  Steed,  and  Gloria \nSheppard  concluded  that  she  should  not  be  placed  in  the \ncommunity.  Additionally,  Dr.  Patel,  a  board  certified \npsychiatrist who  treated  Intervenor,  concluded  that  she  could \nbe  placed  in  the  community  but  that  she  was  receiving  adequate \ntreatment  at GRH-A.  (Affidavit  of  Patel  attached  to \nDefendants'  Motion  For  Summary  Judgment  as  Exhibit  A).  It was \nonly Dr.  Elliott,  Intervenor's  retained expert,  who  now  states \nthat  she  should be  placed  in  the  community.  (See  report  of  Dr. \nElliott  filed by  Intervenor,  which  states  only  that  she  could \nhave  been  placed  in  the  community). \n-4-\n\n(  (' \nDefendants  rely  on  the  fact  submitted with  their Motion  For \nSummary  Judgment,  but  wish  to  highlight  the  following: \nGRH-A  is a  state hospital  in DeKalb  County  near Atlanta, \nGeorgia,  where  patients  with mental  illness,  mental  retardation \nand  substance  abuse  problems  are  treated.  At  the  times \nrelevant  to  this motion,  the  Treatment  Unit  at  GRH-A  was  a \n60-bed  psychiatric  unit  treating voluntary and  involuntary \npatients with  long-term and  acute mental  illness.  (Affidavit \nof  Patel,  p.  3,  attached  to Defendants'  Motion  For  Summary \nJudgment  as  Exhibit  A)  . \nOn  December  20,  1994,  Intervenor was  involuntarily admitted \nto  the  Treatment  Unit  based  in part  on  a  Form  1013,  which  is an \n\"Emergency  Admission  Certificate\"  signed  by  a  licensed \nphysician,  psychologist  or  clinical  social  worker.  The \ncertificate stated that  Intervenor appeared  to be mentally  ill, \nthat  she  had  auditory  and  visual  hallucinations,  was  paranoid, \nand  was  too  \"loose\"  to  care  for  herself.  Id.  at  Para.  10. \nOn  admission  to GRH-A,  she  was  examined  by  a  psychiatrist \nwho  stated  that  she  \"reports visual  hallucinations  (demons),\" \nand  also  that  she  \"reports  hearing  the  voice  of  her \ngrandfather. \"  Id.  at  Para.  1I. \nAt  the  times  relevant  to  the  Complaint,  Dr.  Dilipkumar \nPatel  was  the  Medical  Director of  the  Treatment  Unit  where \nIntervenor was  trea·ted.  He  is  a  Board  Certified Psychiatrist \nlicensed  to  practice  in Georgia.  Id.  at  Para.  2,  3. \n-5-\n\n(- ( \nDr.  Patel  diagnosed  her  as  having  a  Borderline  Personality \nDisorder  and Mild Mental  Retardation.  Id.  at  Para.  12. \nIntervenor  consented  to voluntary  treatment  on  December  30, \n1995.  A  treatment  plan was  developed  for  her  by  the  treatment \nteam,  including Dr.  Patel,  the  case  manager/social  worker, \nnurse,  activity therapist,  and  social  work ·supervisor.  Id.  at \nPara.  13. \nDr.  Patel  and  the  treatment  team  treated  Intervenor as  a \nvoluntary patient at  GRH~A.  In March,  in  response  to  a \ncomplaint  about  Intervenor's mental  retardation  services  from \nIntervenor's  attorney,  Dr.  Patel  consulted with  four  other \npersons  with  extensive  experience  in  treating persons  with \nmental  retardation.  Three  persons,  including  two  psychologists \nand  a  social worker,  were  from  the  Developmental  Learning \nCenter,  GRH-A's  Intermediate  Care  Facility For  the  Mentally \nRetarded  (ICF/MR).  They  concluded  that  Intervenor was  a  very \nchallenging patient  and  agreed with Dr.  Patel  that  the  mental \nretardation  component  of  her  diagnosis  did  not  appear  to be  the \narea  requiring  focused  treatment,  but  rather her personality \ndisorder.  Similarly,  the  Chief  of  the  Psychology Staff,  Dr. \nDeBacher,  concluded  that  Intervenor's behavior problems \nappeared mainly  related  to  her borderline  personality structure \nand  to  her depression and  not  to  insufficient mental \nretardation services.  Id.  at  Para.  17,  18. \nDr.  Patel  and  the  treatment  team  first  attempted  the \ntreatment  methods  in  the  Treatment  Plan,  including medication, \n-6-\n\n(  ( \nactivity therapy,  structure,  group  therapy,  hygiene  class,  and \nother  classes.  In Dr.  Patel's  opinion  this  treatment  was \nprofessionally acceptable  and  had  proved  successful  with  other \npatients  with  similar problems.  They  also attempted  to \ndischarge  Intervenor  to  the  community  to  personal  care  homes, \nwhere  other patients with  similar problems  have  been \nsuccessful.  Id.  at  Para.  13,  22. \nWhen  Intervenor's  mental  condition did  not  significantly \nimprove  and  when  she  repeatedly was  returned  from  placement  in \npersonal  care  homes,  other professionals  at  the  hospital \nsuggested  additional  professionally acceptable  choices  for \ntreatment,  and  her  treatment  plan was  adjusted at various  times \nto  try  to  address  her problems.  Id.  at  Para.  23. \nIntervenor's mental  condition and  her behavior  improved \nslowly  and  she  became  more  compliant  with  treatment.  These \nimprovements  make  it more  likely that  she  would  be  able  to  be \nsuccessful  in  the  community.  Id.  at  Para.  24. \nIn  Dr.  Patel's  opinion:  (1)  Intervenor's  treatment  at  GRH-A \nsince December  20,  1994,  has  been  adequate  and  appropriate  to \nher needsj  (2)  it is appropriate  to  treat a  patient  with  the \nlevel  of  severity of  problems  of  Intervenor  in a  hospital;  and \n(3)  it was  appropriate  and  professionally acceptable  for  her  to \nbe  at GRH-A.  Id.  at  Para.  27. \nDr.  Patel  is  competent  to make  the  treatment  decisions  he \nmade  for  Intervenor and  he  exercised his  professional  judgment \nand made  professionally acceptable  choices.  Id.  at  Para.  29. \n-7-\n\n(  ( \n; \nIt should be  noted  that  currently  Intervenor  is  being \ntreated at Grady Memorial  Hospital  for medical  problems. \nEarnestine  Pittman  is  the  Director  of  the  Fulton  County \nRegional  Board.  The  Regional  Board  is  responsible  for \nestablishing policy and  direction  for  disability services \nplanning,  delivery,  and  evaluation within  Fulton  County, \nO.C.G.A.  §  37-2-5(a),  which  is  Intervenor's  region.  (Affidavit \nof  Earnestine  Pittman,  Para.  2,  attached  to Defendants'  Motion \nFor  Summary  Judgment  as  Exhibit  B) . \nThe  regional  boards  are  also authorized by  the  legislature \nto  access  funds  which  are  appropriated  by  the  legislature  to \nthe Department  of  Medical  Assistance  (DMA)  ,  for matching \nfederal  funds  from  Medicaid  for providing  community  mental \nretardation  services.  These  are used  to  create Medicaid  waiver \nslots,  meaning  that  the  region  is authorized  to  serve  persons \nwith mental  retardation  services  in  the  community  under  the \nMedicaid  waiver  program.  Id.  at  Para.  4. \nThe  Medicaid  waiver  program  is a  primary  funding  source  in \nFulton  County  for  community  residential  services  for  persons \nwith mental  retardation.  Id.  at  Para.  5. \nThe  Fulton County  Regional  Board  does  not  currently have \nany  uncommitted Medicaid  waiver  funding  available  and  therefore \ncannot  provide  these  services  to  Intervenor under  that \nprogram.  The  funding  which  was  appropriated by  the  legislature \nto  DMA  for  the  Medicaid  waiver  program  for  the  Board  is being \nused  to provide  services  for  other disabled persons.  Id.  at \nPara.  6. \n-8-\n\n( \nThe  Board  does  not  currently have  sufficient  annualized \nunallocated  state  funds  available  to  provide  community \nresidential  mental  retardation services  to  Intervenor.  The \nstate  funds  which  have  been  appropriated  to  the  Board  for \ncommunity  retardation services  are  being  used  to provide \nservices  for  other disabled persons.  Id.  at  Para.  7. \nThe  Board,  through  its Comprehensive  Evaluation  Team  (CET), \nis  responsible  for  recommending  the  consumers  who  may  be  served \nunder  the Medicaid waiver  program  in  the  county.  The  CET  is \ncomposed  of  persons  with  special  training and  experience  in the \nassessment  of  needs  and  provision of  services  for  mentally \nretarded person.  Id.  at  Para.  8. \nThe  CET  evaluated E.W.  in March  of  this year  and \nrecommended  against  moving  her  from  Georgia  Regional  Hospital \nat  Atlanta  into  the  community.  Since,  as  stated above,  funding \nis  not  available,  the  CET's  recommendation  did  not  affect \nwhether  services  were  provided  to  E.W.  Id.  at  Para.  9. \nB.  GEORGIA8 S  STATUTORY  FRAMEWORK  FOR  PROVIDING \nDISABILITY  SERVICES \nIntervenor  is but  one  of many  persons  in Georgia  receiving \ndisability services  that  are publicly  funded.  In  this  State, \nthe  planning  and  delivery  of  mental  health,  mental  retardation, \nand  substance  abuse  services  are  accomplished  through  a \ncoordinated  system of  State,  regional,  and  community  agencies. \nThe  services  themselves  are  delivered  in a  broad  spectrum  of \nprograms  and  placements,  in State hospitals  and  other \n-9-\n\n( \ninstitutional  facilities  as  well  as  in  the  community.  See, \n~, O.C.G.A.  §§  37-1-2  (providing  for  a  \"comprehensive  range \nof  quality  services\"),  37-2-2(7)  (defining  \"hospital\"  as \nincluding  inpatient and  other  care),  37-2-S.1(c) (1) \n(authorizing  funding  for  hospitals  and  community  services), \n37-4-40  (providing  for  admission  to  a  facility  or  to an \nalternative placement),  37-5-3  (listing  some  types  of  community \nplacements) . \nState-wide  programs  and  State  facilities  for  these  services \nare  established and maintained by  the Department  of  Human \nResources,  acting  through  its Division  of  Mental  Health,  Mental \nRetardation,  and  Substance  Abuse,  which  was  ordained  by  statute \nin  1964.  O.C.G.A.  §§  37-1-20,  37-2-2.1.  The  Division also \nmakes  and  administers  budget  allocations  to  regional  mental \nhealth,  mental  retardation,  and  substance  abuse  boards \n(O.C.G.A.  §  37-1-20(b) (8);  establishes minimum  funding  amounts \nfor  each  regional  board  (§  37-2-5.1(c))i  and  establishes \nguidelines  for  the  regional  boards'  allocations  to  their \nrespective  community  service  boards  (§  37-2-S.1(c)). \nRegional  boards  were  created by  statute  in 1993.  O.C.G.A. \n§  37-2-4.1(b).  These  boards  administer  disability services \nwithin  their particular  region  of  the  State.  Each  region \nconsists  of  one  or more  counties,  and  each  regional  board \nconsists  of  members  from  each  county  within  the  region. \nO.C.G.A.  §§  37-2-4.1(a),  -5.  The  board  establishes  the  policy \nand  direction  for  disability services  within  its  region \n-10-\n\n( \n(O.C.G.A.  §  37-2-5(a),  exercises  \"responsibility and  authority \nwithin  the  region  in all matters  relating  to  the  funding  and \ndelivery of  disability services\"  (§  37-2-5.2(a) (2)),  contracts \nwith providers  for  these  services  (§  37-2-5.2(a) (5)),  and \nprepares  \"an  annual  plan and  mechanism  for  the  funding  and \nprovision of  all disability services  in  the  region.\" \n§  37-2-5.2 (a) (1) . \nCommunity  mental  health,  mental  retardation,  and  substance \nabuse  service  boards  were  also  created by  the  1993 \nlegislation.  O.C.G.A.  §  37-2-6.  Each  community  service  board, \nwhich  is  composed  of  members  appointed by  the  county  governing \nauthorities  within  the  community's  area  (O.C.G.A.  §  37-2-6(b)), \ngoverns  \"publicly funded  programs  by  providing  certain \ndisability services  not  provided by  other public  or private \nproviders  under  contract  with  the  regional  board.\"  (O.C.G.A. \n§  37-2-6(a)).  It may  make  contracts  for  the  provision of  such \nservices.  O.C.G.A.  §  37-2-6.1(b) (9). \nThus,  all  three  levels  of  government,  state,  regional,  and \ncommunity,  play  roles  in  the  delivery of  disability services. \nThe  regional  boards,  though,  perform at  least  two  of  the  most \ncritical  functions.  First,  they  control  the  flow  of  allocated \nfunds  generally: \nState,  federal,  and  other  funds  appropriated \nto  the  department,  the  division,  or both, \nand  available  for  the  purpose  of  funding  the \nplanning and  delivery  of  disability services \nshall  be  distributed  in accordance  with  this \nsubsection.  After July  I,  1995,  all  funds \n-11-\n\n(  ( \nassociated with  services  to  clients  residing \nwithin  a  given  region  shall  be  allocated \nthrough  the  appropriate  regional  board;  \"all \nfunds\"  shall  include  funding  for  hospitals, \ncommunity  service  boards,  private and  public \ncontracts,  and  any  contracts  relating  to \nservice  delivery  for  clients within  the \ngiven  region;  provided,  however,  that \nnothing  shall  prohibit  the  allocation of \nfunds  through  any  regional  board prior  to \nJuly  I,  1995. \nO.C.G.A.  §  37-2-5.1(c)  (emphasis  supplied);  see  also \n§  37-2-5.2 (a) (2),  supra,  (regional  board  controls  \"all matters \nrelating  to  funding\").  Second,  the  regional  boards  authorize \nwhich  individuals  receive  services;  these  boards  are  \"[t]o \nprovide,  as  funds  become  available,  for  client assessment  and \nservice  authorization and  coordination  for  each  client \nreceiving  services  within  the  region  or  funded  by  the  regional \nboard.\"  O.C.G.A.  §  37-2-5.2(a) (2)  (emphasis  supplied). \nThe  statements  about  fund  availability  in both  of  the  above \nprovisions  are  not  incidental;  an  individual's  right  to \nadequate  disability services  under  Georgia  law  is  limited not \nonly by  that  individual's  condition as  to disability but  also \nby  the  availability of  funds.  The  statute provides  elsewhere, \nfor  example,  that  \"the  department  through  the  division  shall, \nto  the  maximum  extent  possible,  allocate  funds  available  for \nservices  so  as  to provide  an  adequate  disabilities  services \nprogram available  to all  citizens  of  this  state.\"  O.C.G.A. \n§  37-2-II(a)  (emphasis  supplied).  Similarly,  the  statute \nprovides  that\" [t]he  division  shall  establish a  minimum  funding \namount  for  regional  boards  conditioned upon  the  amount  of  funds \n-12-\n\n( \nappropriated  and  a  supplemental  funding  formula  to be  used  for \nthe  distribution of  available  state  funds  in excess  of  the \nminimum  funding  amount.  O.C.G.A.  §  37-2-5.1(c) (1)  (emphasis \nsupplied) . \nFunding  availability also  has  a  direct  impact  on  individual \ncases.  An  individual's  access  to  services  is  governed  by \nO.C.G.A.  chapters  37-3;  37-4  and  37-5;  and  37-7.  These \nchapters  respectively  concern mental  health  services,  mental \nretardation services,  and  substance  abuse  services.  As  to \nmental  retardation services,  chapter  37-4  provides  that\" [a]ny \n~erson may  file  a  petition  for  a  court  ordered program  of \nservices  from  the  department  for  a  mentally  retarded  citizen of \nthis  state.\"  O.C.G.A.  §  37-4-40(a).  The  statute provides \nfurther  that  the  probate  court  must  review  the  petition and,  if \nit finds  reasonable  cause,  order  that  the  allegedly mentally \nretarded person be  examined  by  a  comprehensive  evaluation \nteam.  O.C.G.A.  §  37-4-40-b).  This  multidisciplinary team must \nexamine  the  person and  file  with  the  court  a  report  opining \nwhether  or not  the  person  is  retarded and  also  in need  of \nservices.  O.C.G.A.  §  37-4-40(c).  If  the  report  does  find  that \nthe  person  is  retarded and  needing  services,  the  court  holds  a \nfull  and  fair hearing  on  those  issues.  O.C.G.A.  §  37-4-40~d). \nIf  the  court  finds  at  the  hearing  that  the  person  is \nretarded  and  needs  community  (alternative)  services,  the  court \nmay  order  the  community  program  to be  provided  if such  an \nalternative program  is available and  if  it presents  a \n-13-\n\n( \nreasonable  expectation of  accomplishing  the  habilitation goals \nfor  the  person.  O.C.G.A.  §  37-4-40(e).  If  the  court  finds  that \nthe  person  is  retarded and  rrthat  the  least  restrictive \navailable  alternative which  would  accomplish  the  goals  of  the \nplan  is  for  the  client  to  be  admitted  to a  facility,\"  then  the \ncourt  may  order  such  an  admission,  but  only  if  the  court  also \nfinds  that \n(1)  The  client  requires  direct medical \nservices; \n(2)  The  client  needs  24  hour  training  in a \nresidential  care  facility;  and \n(3)  The  court  has  been  notified by  the \ndepartment  that  a  bed  appropriate  to \nthe  specific  needs  of  the  client  is \navailable  and  that  the  services \nindicated  in  the  individualized program \nplan  submitted  to  the  court  by  the \ncomprehensive  evaluation  team  or by  the \nclient  can  be  provided. \nId.  The  statute  carefully points  out  that  \"least  restrictive \nalternative\"  means  \"that  which  is  the  least  restrictive \navailable  alternative,  environment,  or appropriate \nhabilitation,  as  applicable,  within  the  limits  of  state  funds \nspecifically appropriated  therefor.  O.C.G.A.  §  37-4-2(b) (10) \nII \n(emphasis  supplied). \nThe  statutes  also make  clear that  the  power  to make \ndeterminations  as  to  the  availability of  funded  services \nresides  with  the  Department  and  the  regional  boards.  One \nexample  is  the  statutory provision  just  cited:  the  probate \ncourt may  not  order  services  to  be  delivered at  a  mental \n-14-\n\n(  ( \nretardation  facility unless  the  Department  notifies  the  court \nthat  a  bed  is available.  O.C.G.A.  §  37-4-40(e).  A  coordinate \nprovision defines  \"community  services\"  as  \"all  community-based \nservices  deemed  reasonably necessary by  the  department .... \" \nO.C.G.A.  §  37-5-3.  The  statute provides  that\" [t]he  division, \nin  compliance  with  the  provisions  of  the  appropriations  Act  and \nother applicable  laws,  is authorized  to move  funds  to  and \nbetween  community  and  institutional  programs  based  on  need \n.... \"  O.C.G.A.  §  37-2-5.1 (c) (3)  (emphasis  supplied) . \nRegional  boards  are  to prepare  annual  disability services  plans \nthat  include,  inter alia,  \"[a]  description  in  order  of  priority \nof  all proposed programs  and  disability services  to be  provided \nin  the  region,  and  the  funds  associated with  the provision of \nthes~ services  \"  O.C.G.A.  §  37-2-5.2 (a) (1) (E) . \nTo  summarize  this  part,  Georgia  statutes  establish a \nthree-tiered system of  administrative  agencies  to  deliver \ndisability services.  These  services  are  limited by  the \navailability of  funds  and  other  factors.  The  administrative \nagencies  make  the  discretionary decisions  that  are  inherent  in \nthe  allocation of  appropriated  funds  among  proposed  programs \nand  in  the  delivery  of  services  among  eligible applicants. \nC.  SUMMARY  OF  CONTROLLING  LAW  UNDER  THE  ADA \nIn  the  present  case,  the  substantive  law  that  controls  the \ndisposition  of  this motion  is  Title  II  of  the  Americans  With \nDisabilities Act  and  its  implementing  regulations.  It will  be \n-15-\n\n( \nhelpful,  prior to presenting argument  about  that  law,  to  fix \nclearly its purpose  and  parameters. \n1.  Purpose \nThe  purpose  of  the ADA,  insofar as  it is pertinent  to  this \ncase,  has  been  highlighted  in a  preamble  or  introductory \nremarks  published with  the  regulations.  The  preamble  states: \nSection  504  of  the  Rehabilitation Act  of \n1973  (29  U.S.C.  794),  which  prohibits \ndiscrimination  on  the  basis  of  handicap  in \nfederally  assisted programs  and  activities, \nalready  covers  those  programs  and  activities \nof  public  entities  that  receive  Federal \nfinancial  assistance.  Title  II  of  the ADA \nextends  this prohibition  of  discrimination \nto  include  all  services,  programs,  and \nactivities provided  or made  available  by \nState  and  local  governments  or any  of  their \ninstrumentalities  or agencies,  regardless  of \nthe  receipt  of  Federal  financial  assistance. \nPreamble,  printed at  56  Fed.  Reg.  35,  694,  et  seq.  (1991),  and \nas  Appendix A,  28  C.F.R.  Pt.  35  (1995)  at 448-9.  Even  more \nspecifically,  the  preamble  notes: \nThis  regulation  implements  subtitle A  of \nTitle  II  of  the  ADA,  which  applies  to  state \nand  local  governments.  Most  programs  and \nactivities  of  state and  local  governments \nare  recipients  of  federal  financial \nassistance  from  one  or more  federal  fudning \nagencies  and,  therefore,  are  already  covered \nby  section  504  of  the  Rehabilitation Act  of \n1973,  as  amended  (29  U.S.C.  794)  (\"section \n504\"),  which  prohibits  discrimination  on  the \nbasis  of  handicap  in  federally  assisted \nprograms  and  activities.  Because  Title  II \nof  the  ADA  essentially extends  the \nnondiscrimination mandate  of  section 504  to \nthose  state  and  local  governments  that  do \nnot  receive  federal  financial  assistance, \nthis  rule  hews  closely  to  the  provision of \nexisting  section  504  regulations. \n56  Fed.  Reg.  33,  694  (1991). \n-16-\n\n(  (\" \n2.  Texts \na.  Statute \nThe  text  of  the  ADA,  so  far  as  it is pertinent  to  the \npresent  case,  is quite brief.  Substantively,  that  text \nprovides: \nSubject  to  the  provisions  of  this \nsubchapter,  no  qualified  individual  with  a \ndisability shall,  by  reason  of  such \ndisability,  be  excluded  from  participation \nin or be  denied  the  benefits  of  the \nservices,  programs,  or activities  of  a \npublic  entity,  or be  subjected  to \ndiscrimination by  any  such  entity. \n42  U.S.C.  §  12132  (1995). \nProcedurally and  remedially,  the  text  (42  U.S.C.  §  12133) \nsimply  incorporates  the  \"remedies,  procedures,  and  rights\"  of \nthe  Rehabilitation Act  of  1973  (29  U.S.C.  §  794a),  which  in \nturn  incorporates  those  features  of  Title VI  of  the  Civil \nRights  Act  of  1964  (42  U.S.C.  §  2000d,  et  seg.).  Specifically, \nthe  last-naItJ.ed  act  provides  that a  \"State  shall  not  be  immune \nunder  the  Eleventh Amendment  of  the  Constitution of  the  United \nStates  from  suit  in  Federal  court  for  a  violation of  .  .  .  the \nprovisions  of  any  other Federal  statute prohibiting \ndiscrimination by  recipients  of  Federal  financial  assistance,\" \nand  that  legal  and  equitable  remedies  for  a  violation are \navailable  \"to  the  same  extent  as  such  remedies  are  available \nfor  such  a  violation  in  the  suit against  any  public  or private \nentity other  than  a  State.\"  These  provisions  are  echoed  in \nanother  section of  the ADA.  42  U.S.C.  §  12202  (1995). \n-17-\n\n(. \n( \nFinally,  the ADA  requires  the  Attorney  General  to promulgate \nregulations  \"that  implement  this part\"  no  later than  July \n25,  1991.  42  U.S.C.  §  12134(a)  (1995). \nb.  Regulations \nThe  pertinent  part  of  the  regulations  is 28  C.F.R.  35.130 \n(1995),  entitled  \"General  prohibitions  against \ndiscrimination.\"  It begins  with a  paraphrase  of  the \nsubstantive part  of  the  statute  (§  35.130(a»  and  then  states, \nsometimes  in great  detail,  five  elaborations  on  that  text.  One \nis  particularly pertinent  here,  and  that  is  the  shortest  of  the \nfive: \nA  public  entity shall  administer  services, \nprograms,  and  activities  in  the most \nintegrated  setting appropriate  to  the  needs \nof  qualified  individuals  with  disabilities. \n§35.130(d). \nThis  subpart  and  another  one,  §  35.130(b) (1) (iv»,  are \ndiscussed  in a  preamble  of  the  regulations,  part  of  which  is \ncontained  in Appendix  A  of  28  C.F.R.  Part  35.  The  preamble \nnotes  that  \"the  standards  adopted  in this  part  are  generally \nthe  same  as  those  required under  section 504\"  (App.  A  of  28 \nC.F.R.  Pt.  35  at  449)  and  then  states: \nMany  commenters  objected  to proposed \nparagraphs  (b(l) (iv)  and  (d)  as  allowing \ncontinued  segregation of  individuals  with \ndisabilities.  The  Department  recognizes \nthat  promoting  integration of  individuals \nwith  disabilities  into  the  mainstream  of \nsociety is an  important  objective  of  the ADA \nand  agrees  that,  in most  instances,  separate \nprograms  for  individuals  with  disabilities \n-18-\n\n(., \n( \nwill  not  be  permitted.  Nevertheless, \nsection 504  does  permit  separate programs  in \nlimited  circumstances,  and  Congress  clearly \nintended  the  regulations  issued under  title \nII  to  adopt  the  standards  of  section 504. \nFurthermore,  congress  included  authority  for \nseparate programs  in  the  specific \nrequirements  of  title III of  the  Act. \nSection  302(b) (1) (A)  (iii)  of  the  Act \nprovides  for  separate  benefits  in  language \nsimilar  to  that  in  §  35.130(b) (1) {iv),  and \nsection 302(b) (1) (B)  includes  the  same \nrequirements  for  \"the most  integrated \nsetting appropriate\"  as  in  §  35.130(d). \nApp.  A,  28  C.F.R.  Pt.  35  459. \nA.  THIS  INJUNCTION  FAILS  TO  MEET  THE \nELEVENTH  CIRCUITuS  MORE  STRINGENT \nSUBSTANTIVE  AND  PROCEDURAL  STANDARDS. \nA preliminary  injunction  is an  extraordinary and  drastic \nremedy,  United  States v.  Jefferson County,  720  F.2d  1511,  1519 \n(11th  Cir.  1983),  whose  sole  purpose  is  to preserve  the \nrelative positions  of  the  parties until  a  trial  on  the  merits \ncan  be  held.  University  of  Texas  v.  Camenisch,  451  U.S.  390, \n395,  101  S.Ct.  1830,  68  L.Ed.2d  175  (1981).  The  traditional \nstandards  for  granting preliminary  injunctive  relief,  which  are \napplied  in  this  Circuit,  are  that  the  movant  must  show  (1)  a \nsubstantial  likelihood that  she  will  ultimately prevail  on  the \nmerits;  (2)  that  she  will  suffer irreparable  injury unless  the \ninjunction  issues;  (3)  that  the  threatened  injury to  the movant \noutweighs  whatever  damage  the  proposed  injunction may  cause  the \nopposing  party;  and  (4)  that  if  issued,  the  injunction would \n-19-\n\nnot  be  adverse  to  the  public  interest.  Baker v.  Buckeye \nCellulose  Corp.,  856  F.2d  167,  169  (11th  Cir.  1988). \nIn  this  Circuit  and  the  Fifth Circuit,  however,  these \nstandards  are  applied more  stringently  than  in all  of  the  other \ncircuits,  in  that  in our  Circuit and  its progenitor,  the  movant \nmust  clearly carry  the  burden  of  persuasion  on  all  four \nstandards.  Jefferson  County,  supra,  720  F.2d  at  1519,  citing \nCanal  Authority v.  Callaway,  489  F.2d  567,  573  (5th  Cir.  1974); \nDoe  v.  Duncanville  Ind.  Sch.  Dist.,  994  F.2d  160  (5th  Cir. \n1993) i  Roho Inc.  v.  Marquis,  902  F.2d  356  (5th  Cir.  1990);  see \nr \n7  James  Wm.  Moore,  Moore's  Federal  Practice  (Part  2), \n~  65.04[1]  at  65-35,  n.4,  65-45,65-62. \nThe  nature  of  the  injunction sought  in  the  present  case \nmakes  other  injunctive principles pertinent.  These  principles \nare  aptly  summarized  in a  Tenth  Circuit  case: \nIn addition,  the  following  types  of \npreliminary  injunctions are  disfavored  and \nthey  require  that  the movant  satisfy an  even \nheavier burden  of  showing  that  the  four \nfactors  listed above  weigh  heavily and \ncompellingly  in movant's  favor  before  such \nan  injunction may  be  issued:  (1)  a \npreliminary  injunction  that  disturbs  the \nstatus  quo;  (2)  a  preliminary  injunction \nthat  is mandatory  as  opposed  to prohibitory; \nand  (3)  a  preliminary  injunction  that \naffords  the  movant  substantially all  the \nrelief  he  may  recover at  the  conclusion  of  a \nfull  trial on  the  merits. \nA  preliminary  injunction that  alters  the \nstatus  quo  goes  beyond  the  traditional \npurpose  for  preliminary  injunctions,  which \nis  only  to  preserve  the  status  quo  until  a \ntrial  on  the  merits may  be  had  .... \nMandatory  injunctions  are more  burdensome \n-20-\n\n( \nthan prohibitory  injunctions  because  they \naffirmatively  require  the  nonmovant  to  act \nin a  particular way,  and  as  a  result  they \nplace  the  issuing  court  in a  position where \nit may  have  to provide  ongoing  supervision \nto assure  that  the  nonmovant  is  abiding  by \nthe  injunction  .  Finally,  a \npreliminary  injunction  that  awards  the \nmovant  substantially all  the  relief he  may \nbe  entitled to  if he  succeeds  on  the  merits \nis  similar  to  the  \"Sentence  first  -- Verdict \nAfterwards\"  type  of  procedure  parodied  in \nAlice  in Wonderland,  which  is an  anathema  to \nour  system  of  jurisprudence.  Thus,  in order \nto prevail  on  a  motion  for  preliminary \ninjunction where  the  requested  injunction \nfalls  into  one  or more  of  these  three \ncategories,  the  movant  must  show  that  on \nbalance,  the  four  factors  weigh  heavily  and \ncompellingly  in his  favor. \nSCFC  ILC,  Inc.  v.  VISA  USA,  Inc.,  936  F.2d  1096,  1098-9  (1991) \n(citations  and  footnotes  omitted). \nThe  procedural  aspects  of  preliminary  injunctions  are \ndetailed ,in Rule  65  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure. \nNo  preliminary  injunction  shall  be  issued without  notice  to  the \nadverse  party  (R.65(a) (1»,  and  typically  one  will  not  be \nissued without  a  hearing.  Baker,  supra.  Rule  65(c)  provides: \nNo  restraining  order  or preliminary \ninjunction shall  issue  except  upon  the \ngiving  of  security by  the  applicant,  in  such \nsum  as  the  court  deems  proper,  for  the \npayment  of  such  costs  and  damages  as  may  be \nincurred or  suffered by  any  party who  is \nfound  to  have  been wrongfully  enjoined  or \nrestrained.  No  such  security shall  be \nrequired  of  the  United  States  or  of  an \nofficer or agency  thereof. \nSecurity may  be  required  for  preliminary  injunctions,  where \nappropriate,  in virtually any  type  of  case,  including  ones \nraising  claims  of  discrimination.  See,~, Camenisch,  supra \n(§  504  claim). \n-21-\n\n(. \n( \nB.  INTERVENOR  IS  NOT  LIKELY  TO  PREVAIL  ON \nTHE  MERITS. \n1.  Intervenor Cannot  Show  That  She \nHas  Been  Denied A  Benefit  Or \nService  By  Reason  Of  Her \nDisability,  As  Required  Under  The \nADA. \nAs  stated in Part  II.C.2.a.  above,  the  pertinent  text  of \nthe  ADA  is quite  brief: \nSubject  to  the  provisions  of  this \nsubchapter,  no  qualified  individual  with  a \ndisability shall,  by  reason  of  such \ndisability,  be  excluded  from  participation \nin or be  denied  the  benefits  of  the \nservices,  programs,  or activities  of  a \npublic  entity,  or be  subjected  to \ndiscrimination by  any  such  entity. \n42  U.S.C.  §  12132  (1995)  (emphasis  added). \nIn  order  to  state a  claim,  then,  Intervenor must  show  the \nfollowing: \n1.  she  is  a  qualified individual  with a \ndisability; \n2.  she  was  denied  a  public benefit;  and \n3.  that  such  denial  of  benefits  or \ndiscrimination was  by  reason  of  her \ndisability. \nKornblau  v.  Dade  County,  86  F.3d  193  (11th  Cir.  1996). \nAs  to  the  first  element  of  the  claim,  the  ADA  defines  it as \nfollows: \nThe  term  \"qualified  individual  with a \ndisability\"  means  an  individual  with  a \ndisability who,  with  or without  reasonable \nmodifications  to  rules,  policies,  or \n-22-\n\nc-\npractices,  the  removal  of  architectural, \ncommunication,  or  transportation barriers, \nor  the  provision of  auxiliary aids  and \nservices,  meets  the  essential  eligibility \nrequirements  for  the  receipt  of  services  or \nthe  participation in programs  or activities \nprovided by  a  public  entity. \n42  USC  §  12131(2).  The  disability which  Intervenor  is  claiming \nin  this  case  is apparently mental  retardation  (Intervenor's \nBrief,  p.  3,  line  1,  and  p.  9,  para.  3;  Intervenor's  Complaint, \npara.  2,  5),  although  Intervenor also  refers  generally  to  her \nbehavioral/emotional  deficits  (Brief,  p.  4,  para.  2),  a \npersonality  change  (Brief,  p.  22,  para.  1),  and  a  IIvariety  of \nmental  disordersll  (Complaint,  para.  5).  For  the  purpose  of \nshowing  she  is disabled,  however,  Defendants  agree  that \nIntervenor  is mentally  retarded and  thus  disabled under  the  ADA. \nIn  regard  to being  IIqualifiedll  for  a  benefit,  Intervenor \nclaims  that  she  is  lIa  qualified  individual\"  under  the Act \nbecause  she  \"qualifies\"  for  the  community  services  she  seeks. \n(Intervenor's  Brief,  p.  22).  This  is  a  circular argument. \nFurther attempting  to  show  that  she  is  \"qualified,\"  she  merely \nstates  that  she  \"needs\"  a  community  placement  and  that  some \nprofessionals  believe  that with adequate  supports  she  could \nlive  in  one.  This  argument  falls  short  of  stating  that  she \nmeets  the  \"essential  eligibility requirements\"  for  a  program  or \nservices,  as  required under  the  ADA  cited above.  42  U.S.C. \n§  12131(2).  Nonetheless,  for  the  purpose  of  this motion, \nDefendants  agree  that  Intervenor may  be  able  to  show  that  she \nwould  meet  eligibility requirements  and  be  qualified  for \ncertain services  or programs  in  the  community. \n-23-\n\nr· \n( \nIntervenor  totally failed,  however,  to  allege  that  she  has \nbeen denied  services  in  the  community  by  reason  of  her \ndisability.  Her  claim  is basically that  she  is mentally \nretarded,  that  professionals  agree  that  her needs  can  be  met  in \na  community-based  program,  and  that  a  provider would  be  willing \nto  serve  her  if Defendants  will  pay  for  the  program.  Nowhere \ndoes  Intervenor allege  that  Defendants  are  refusing  to  fund \nsuch a  program  or  refusing  to place  her  in such  a  program by \nreason  of  her  disability. \nIn  considering  this  element  of  the  discrimination acts,  the \ncourts  have  most  typically considered  cases  in which  the \ndisabled plaintiff alleges  that  he  is  being  denied  a  benefit  or \nservice which  is  being made  available  to  others  who  are  not \ndisabled.  In  Southeastern Community  College  v.  Davis,  442  U.S. \n397,  99  S.Ct.  2361,  60  L.Ed.2d  980  (1979),  plaintiff had  a \nhearing  impairment  and  sought  admission  to  nursing  school, \nwhich  would  require  full-time,  personal  supervision whenever \nshe  attended  patients  and  elimination of  all  clinical  courses. \nThe  Court  found  that plaintiff's right  to be  integrated  into \nsociety  did  not  require  such  a  substantial  modification  of  the \ngrantee's  nursing  program.  Id. \nSimilarly,  in Alexander v.  Choate,  469  U.S.  287,  105  S.Ct. \n712,  83  L.Ed.2d  712  (1985),  plaintiffs were  Medicaid  recipients \nwho  challenged Tennessee's  reduction  in  the  number  of  days  that \nthe  state Medicaid  would  pay  hospitals  on  behalf  of  Medicaid \nrecipients.  The  Court  found  no  violation of  §  504,  even  though \n-24-\n\nCo \n( \nplaintiffs alleged  that  the  reduction  from  20  days  to 14  days \nwould  have  a  disproportionate  effect  on  the  handicapped. \nMany  other  cases  have  considered  the  claims  of  disabled \nr \npersons  alleging  exclusion  from  or denial  of  services by  reason \nof  their disability relative  to  non-disabled  persons. \nConcerned  Parents  To  Save  Dreher  Park  Center v.

For \nexample,  in Doe  v.  Coluatti,  592  F.2d  704  (3rd  Cir.  1979), \nplaintiff  challenged  a  Pennsylvania  statute which  discriminated \nagainst  mentally  disabled  relative  to  physically disabled \npersons.

At  least  two  courts  have  held  that plaintiffs  stated a \ncause  of  action when  they  alleged  they were  excluded  from \ncommunity  programs  for  the  disabled based  on  the  severity of \ntheir disabilities.  Conner  v.  Branstad,  839  F.  Supp.  1346 \n(S.D.lowa  1993);  Jackson v.  Fort  Jackson  Hosp.  and  Training \nSchool,  757  F.

Does  v.  Chandler,  83  F.3d  1150  (9th  Cir.  1996) i \nSandison v.  Michigan  High  School  Athletic Ass'n.,  Inc.,  64  F.3d \n1026  (9th  Cir.  1995);  Daniel  B.v.  White,  1991  W.L.  58494  (E.D. \nPa.  1991) i  and  Clark v.  Cohen,  613  F.  Supp.  684  (E.D.  Pa. \n1985),  aff'd on  other grounds,  794  F.2d  79  (3rd  Cir.  1986). \nFor  example,  the  Clark  Court  found  that  the  only  explanation \nfor  the  failure  to provide  plaintiff with  community  services \nwas  \"a  chronic  lack  of  funds  or bureaucratice misplacement  of \n-27-\n\nc \nplaintiff  over  the  years.  Id.  at  693.  Therefore,  the  lack of \na  placement  was  not  due  to  her disability and  there  was  no \n§  504  violation. \nIn  this  case,  Intervenor  has  not  alleged  that  she  has  been \ndenied  the  services  she  seeks  due  to  her  disability,  as \ncompared  to  other disabled persons  who  are  provided \ncommunity-based  services.  She  has  identified no  particular \ndisability,  or  combination  of  disabilities,  or  severity  of \ndisability as  the  basis  for  the  alleged discrimination. \nAlthough  she  states  that Defendants  have  \"discriminated\" \nagainst  her based  upon  her  disability~  she  does  not  state  that \nthey have  denied  services  to  her due  to  her  disability.  Since \nthe  only  \"discrimination\"  being  alleged  is  the  denial  of \nservices,  Intervenor must  show  that  the  denial  of  services  is \ndue  to  her  disability.  As  was  stated succinctly by  the  Seventh \nCircuit, \n(Plaintiffs)  appear  to  contend  that,  under \n(§  504),  (defendants)  had  the  affirmative \nduty  to  create  less  restrictive  community \nresidential  settings  for  them.  But  there  is \nno  contention  that  these  class members, \nbecause  of  their handicap,  are being  denied \naccess  to  community  residential  living  that \nIllinois  is  affording  to  others.  Thus, \ngiving  effect  to  the  plain meaning  of  this \nstatute,  (cit.  omitted),  it simply  has  no \napplication  to  (plaintiffs')  claim. \nPhillips v.  Thompson,  715  F.2d  365  (7th  Cir.  1983). \n-28-\n\n(  (. \n2.  Intervenor's  Reliance  On  The \n\"Integration Regulation\"  Is  Misplaced. \nIntervenor's  entire  claim  is based  on  the  rationale,  stated \nin Helen  L.  v.  Didario,  46  F.  3d  324  (3rd  Cir.  1995),  that  the \n\"integration  regulation\"  requires  the  State  to provide  services \nfor  her  in  the  community.  According  to  Intervenor,  \"the \nfailure  to  integrate  is discrimination Qy  itself\"  and  she  thus \nbypasses  the  requirement  in  the  ADA  that  a  plaintiff prove  that \nthe  State's  failure  to  provide  a  particular service  is  due  to \nher disability.  (Intervenor's  Brief,  p.  19).  This  argument  is \nflawed  for  several  reasons. \nFirst,  in  the  context  of  this  case,  Intervenor  is \nessentially arguing  that  the  integration  regulation mandates \ndeinstitutionalization,  whereby  everyone  who  could be  treated \nin  the  community  must  be  treated  in  the  community.  She  has  not \nclaimed  that  she  is being  denied a  placement  due  to  a \nparticular disability which  distinguishes  her  from  others \nreceiving  placements.  Thus,  she  is  simply  arguing  that  the \nState must  treat mentally  disabled persons  in community-based \nprograms  instead  of  in  institutionally-based programs. \nThis  argument  has  been  put  forth  often under  the  ADA  or \n§  504  but  has  rarely met  with  favor  by  the  courts.  As  stated \nabove,  the  Seventh  Circuit  held  that  §  504  did  not  require  the \nState  to  provide  community  residential  placements  for \ninstitutionalized plaintiffs,  as  plaintiffs had  contended. \nPhillips,  supra.  Similarly,  the  Sixth Circuit  has  held  that \n§  504  does  not  include  a  legislative mandate  for \n-29-\n\ndeinstitutionalization.  Kentucky Ass'n.  For  Retarded  Citizens, \nInc.  v.  Conn.,  674  F.  2d  582,  585  (6th  Cir.  1982),  cert. \ndenied,  459  U.S.  1041,  103  S.  Ct.  457,  74  L.ED.  2d  609  (1982). \nIn  this  Circuit,  in S.H.  and  P.F.,  supra,  the  district \ncourt  found  that  §  504  did  not  require  defendants  to provide \nhabilitation in  the  community  where  plaintiffs  could  not  show \nthat  they were  being denied  these  services  due  to  their \ndisability.  Other  courts  have  denied  plaintiffs'  contentions \nthat  §  504  or  the  ADA  mandated  deinstitutionalization.  Jackson \nv.  Fort  Stanton  Hosp.  and  Training  School,  964  F.2d  980  (10th \nCir.  1992);  Conner v.  Branstad,  839  F.  Supp.  1346  (S.D.  Iowa \n1993);  Daniel  B.  v.  White,  199  W.L.  58494  (E.D.Pa.  1991);  Clark \nv.  Cohen,  613  F.  Supp.,  684  (E.D.  Pa.  1985),  aff'd.  on  other \ngrounds,  794  F.2d  79  (3rd  Cir.  1986),  cert.  denied,  479  U.S. \n912. \nSecond,  in light  of  the  active  litigation on  this  issue,  it \nseems  reasonable  that  if Congress  believed  the  courts  were \nincorrect  in  interpreting  its intent  on  the  issue  of \ndeinstitutionalization and  had  wished  to  clarify it,  it would \nhave  surely done  so  when  it passed  the  ADA.  Yet  neither  the \nexplicit  language  of  the ADA  nor  the  legislative history  call \nfor  or  require  deinstitutionalization of  mentally  retarded \nindividuals.  If  Congress  had  intended  such  a  radical  step,  it \nsurely would  have  clearly stated it. \nTo  the  contrary,  in  the  legislative history  of  the  ADA \nCongress  indicated that  it did  not  intend any  radical  departure \n-30-\n\n(  ( \nfrom  §  504.  Title  II of  the  ADA  was  intended  to  \"extend  the \nnondiscrimination policy  in  §  504  of  the  Rehabilitation Act  of \n1973  to  cover  all  State and  local  governmental  entities.\" \nH.R.Rep.No.  101-485(II),  101st  Cong.,  2d  Sess.  84  (1990), \nreprinted  in 1990  U.S.C.C.A.N.  267.  Again,  Title  II \n\"essentially simply  extends  the  antidiscrimination prohibition \nembodied  in  §  504  to  all  actions  of  state and  local \ngovernment.\"  Id.  at  367. \nFurther,  the  integration  regulation under  the  ADA  is \nsubstantially  identical  to  the  §  504  integration  regulation \nwhich  had  been  in effect  since  1981.  28  C.F.R.  §  35.130(d), \n28  C.F.R.  §  41.5(d)  (1981).  Thus,  Congress  did  not  intend  a \nsubstantive  extension of  §  504  to  include  entirely new  mandates \nsuch  as  deinstitutionalization.  Rather,  it simply  extended  the \nexisting  requirements  to additional  entities. \nThird,  the  regulations  do  not  define what  is meant  in 28 \nC.F.R.  §  35.130(d)  by  \"integration.\"  If  the  regulation meant \nthat  it was  no  longer  necessary  to  show  discrimination under \nthe ADA  or  that  the  ADA  required deinstitutionalization,  surely \nit would  have  said  so. \nIt  is anticipated  that  Intervenor may  argue  that  she  is  not \nseeking  deinstitutionalization,  but  as  was  contended  in \nHelen  L.,  simply  that  since  she  allegedly qualifies  for  a \ncommunity  program,  the  State's  failure  to  provide  her  treatment \nin  the  most  integrated setting appropriate  to  her  needs \n(without  a  proper  justification)  violates  the  ADA.  Helen  L.  v. \nDidario,  46  F.3d  325,  336  (3rd  Cir.  1995). \n-31-\n\n( \nOf  course,  in this  case,  unlike  in Helen  L.,  the \nprofessionals  did not  agree  that  Intervenor  should  leave \nGRH-A.  Joseph  Steed,  Dr.  DeBacher,  and  Gloria  Shepherd  all \nbelieved  that  she  needed  inpatient  care,  thus,  GRH-A  was  the \nmost  integrated setting appropriate  to  her needs. \nAdditionally,  Defendant  Pittman  stated that  there  were  no  funds \nto  provide  a  community  residential  placement  for  Intervenor and \nthat  existing  funds  were  being  used  to  service  other disabled \npersons. \nMore  significantly,  however,  this  distinction stated in \nHelen  L.  between  \"deinstitutionalization\"  on  the  one  hand  and \nproviding  services  \"in the most  integrated setting appropriate\" \non  the  other,  is  extremely  elusive  at  best,  and  in most \nsituations  is non-existent.  Further,  the  Helen  L.  Court \nrequires  the  state  to  justify its decisions  to  fund  a  certain \nmix  of  programs  and  services,  which  is generally beyond  the \nreach  of  the  federal  courts. \nAdditionally,  where  there  has  been  no  finding  or  allegation \nthat  plaintiff was  denied  services  due  to a  disability,  courts \nhave  not  applied  the  \"reasonable  accommodation\"  analysis  to  the \nstate's provision  of  services.  Conner,  supra;  Phillips,  supra; \nJackson,  supra;  SH  and  PF,  supra;  and  Daniel  B.,  supra. \nThe  Helen  L.  Court  alone  bypasses  the  requirement  under  the \nADA  that  plaintiff must  allege  that  she  has  been denied  a \nservice by  reason  of  her  disability.  Intervenor  cites  to \n-32-\n\nr· \n( \n\"Halderman v.  Pennhurst  State School  and  Hosp.,  784  F.  Supp. \n215,  224  (E.D.  Pa.  1992),  aff'd.,  977  F.2d  568  (3rd  Cir.  1992)\" \nto  support  her assertion  that  courts  other than  Helen  L.  have \nreached  this  conclusion.  (Intervenor's  brief,  p.  24).  Yet \nthis  citation  is erroneous,  because  the  Circuit  Court  affirmed \nthe  decision  of  the  district  court  on  other grounds  and \nspecifically did  not  reach  the  §  504  issue.  In  the  other  cases \ncited here  by  Intervenor,  the  courts  found  that  the  plaintiff \nwas  being  denied  a  benefit  or service  due  to  his  disability and \ndid not  base  the  decision  simply  on  a  failure  to  integrate. \nColeman,  supra;  Jackson,  supra;  and  Ga.  Assn.  of  Retarded \nCitizens v.  McDaniel,  511  F.  Supp.  126,  128  (N.D.  Ga.  1981). \nClearly,  it was  not  Congress'  intent  in  the  ADA  to mandate \nthat  states provide  services  for  the  disabled  in the  \"least \nrestrictive  environment.\"  To  the  extent  that  the  \"integration \nregulation\"  is  interpreted  to  require  such  a  result  it would \nexceed  the  scope  of  the ADA. \nC.  INTERVENOR  HAS  NOT  BEEN  IRREPARABLY \nHARMED. \nIt is  still viable  law  that  a  \"basic  doctrine  of  equity \njurisprudence  [is]  that  courts  of  equity  should  not  act,  and \nparticularly should  not  act  to  restrain a  criminal  prosecution, \nwhen  the  moving  party has  an  adequate  remedy  at  law  and  will \nnot  suffer  irreparable  injury  if denied  equitable  relief.\" \nO'Shea  v.  Littleton,  414  U.S.  488,  499,  94  S.  Ct.  669, \n38  L.Ed.2d  674  (1974)  (denial  of  injunction against \n-33-\n\n(  (. \n. \nprosecutions  alleged  to violate  civil  rights),  quoting  Younger \nv.  Harris,  401  U.S.  37,  43-44,  91  S.Ct.  746,  27  L.Ed.2d  669 \n(1971)  (same).  In  the  present  case,  Intervenor  seeks  a \nmandatory  injunction  forcing  the  defendants  to  discharge  her \nfrom  a  facility and  to pay  for  a  residential  and  habilitation \nplacement  in  the  community. \nEven  assuming  for  argument's  sake  that  Intervenor  is harmed \nby  her  current  situation,  however,  she  cannot  bear her  heavy \nburden  of  clearly showing  that  she  will  be  irreparably harmed. \nFor  each harm  claimed,  there  is an  adequate  legal  remedy,  and \nthis  is  so  even  if her  remedies  were  to  be  restricted  just  to \nthose  provided by  the  State's mental  health,  mental \nretardation,  and  substance  abuse  statutes. \nTo  the  extent  that  Intervenor  claims  that  she  is being \nharmed  by  her  continued  treatment  at GRH-A,  she  has  two  State \njudicial  remedies.  First,  as  a  voluntary patient,  she  or her \nrepresentative  can  request  discharge  and,  if the  chief medical \nofficer denies  her  request,  she  must  be  either involuntarily \ncommitted  or  released  through  a  probate  court  proceeding. \nD.C.G.A.  §  37-3-22.  Second,  whether  she  is voluntary  or \ninvoluntary,  she  or her  representative  could  file  in  the \nprobate  court  a  petition alleging  that  she  is being  unjustly \ndenied  a  right  or privilege granted by  the mental  health \nstatute  or  that  a  procedure  authorized  by  that  statute  is  being \nabused.  D.C.G.A.  §  37-3-148(b).  In both proceedings,  the \npatient  has  a  right  to  a  full  and  fair hearing,  including \n-34-\n\n(  ( \neffective assistance  of  counsel,  and  she  may  appeal  the  probate \ncourt's  decision.  O.C.G.A.  §§  37-3-1(8),-150. \nTo  the  extent  that  Intervenor  claims  that  she  requires \nmental  retardation services  in the  community,  she  or anyone \nelse  can  file  in  the  probate  court  a  petition to  receive  such \nservices.  O.C.G.A.  §  37-4-40.  Again,  the  petition is \ndetermined  by  the  court  upon  a  full  and  fair  hearing,  with  the \npatient  retaining  the  right  to  appeal  that  court's  decision. \nO.C.G.A.  §§37-4-2(7),-110.  Intervenor has  not  shown  that  she \nhas  utilized any  of  these  remedies.  She  thus  can  show  no \nirreparable  harm. \nD.  THE  BA.LANCING  OF  HARMS  AND \nCONSIDERATION  OF  THE  PUBLIC  INTEREST \nFAVOR  DENIAL  OF  THE  INJUNCTION. \nIn  the present  case,  the  balancing  of  harms  to  the \nrespective  parties and  proper  consideration  of  the  public \ninterest are  not  clearly separable  from  the  factors  already \ndiscussed.  The  harm  to Defendants  from  a  mandatory  injunction \nis that  the  State would  have  to pay  a  considerable  sum \n(including  possibly  capital  expenditures)  for  Intervenor's \ncommunity  placement,  just as  though  the  Court  had  entered a \nfinal  judgment,  and  regardless  of  an  ultimate  finding  that \nthere was  no  ADA  violation.  The  public  interest  is not  served \nby  the  expenditure  of  limited  funds  for  a  person  who  has  no \nlegitimate  entitlement  to  this  funds.  Nor  is  that  interest \nserved by  intrusion  into  the  discretionary  zone  entrusted by \nlaw  to  the  professionals  within  the  state administrative \nagencies. \n-35-\n\nc· \n( \nFor  the  above-stated  reasons,  Defendants  respectfully \nrequest  that  Intervenor's Motion  For  Preliminary  Injunction be \ndenied. \nRespectfully  submitted, \nMICHAEL  J.

INTRODUCTION \nThis  case arises' from  the plight of L.C.,  a  27-year old woman \nwho has been confined for three consecutive years in a  state mental \nhospital.  Before  this  admission,  she  had  been  admitted  eighteen \ntimes  and  spent more  than  half  of  her  life since  she was  fourteen \nin state psychiatric facilities.  [See print-out dated June 16,  1994 \nof  admission  history  from  Georgia  Regional  Hospital  at  Atlanta \n(hereafter,  GRH-A),  Exhibit A]  Although  Plaintiff  has  a  diagnosis \nof  mental  illness,  at  least  three  comprehensive  psychological \nevaluations  since  1986  have  stressed  her  need  for  training  and \n\nhabilitation  to  address  her  limitations  as  a  mentally  retarded \nadult.  For at least the past year and  one-half,  the  staff at the \nhospital  have  conceded  that  her  mental  illness  has  been \nsufficiently under control so that confinement in a  mental hospital \nis  unnecessary.  More  specifically,  the  staff  have  acknowledged \nthat L.Co  requires an appropriate community residential placement. \nThis view is echoed by an expert clinical psychologist retained by \nPlaintiff,  Dr.  Cecelia  Kimble. \nThis  case was  filed on May  11,  1995.  Rather than provide L.C. \nwith  the  appropriate  services  and  treatment  that  everyone  admits \nshe  needs,  Defendant  DHR  abruptly  released  L.C.  to  her  mother  on \nMay  19,  1995  on  a  \"trial basis.\"  Thus,  L.C.  remains  in the  state's \nlegal  custody.  The  state  made  this  hasty  decision  without  any \nprovision  for  necessary  supportive  services  despite  L.C.'s  long \nhistory  of  extreme  difficulties  living  in  the  community  without \nnecessary and  appropriate  supports  and  three  consecutive  years  in \nthe  hospital with  very  little family  contact. \nL.C.'s  problems  in  the  community  have  been  most  acute  in  the \narea  of  behavior  management  and  crisis  intervention.  Yet, \nPlaintiff  is  unaware  of  any  plans  to  address  these  and  other \nindividual  needs  arising  from  her  developmental  disabilities  and \nher  years  of  inappropriate  confinement.  She  is  further  unaware  of \nany acknowledgment of responsibility by defendants to provide staff \nand  progra~ support  to L.C.'s  family  and/or  to  provide  L.C.  with \na  residential option in the event that her mother is unable to cope \nwith  L.C.'s  many,  significant  needs.  This  is  a  serious  concern \n2 \n\ngiven the mother's past history.  The mother has already shown that \nshe  lacks the skills to manage Plaintiff and that she relies on the \nhospital as  the  solution to behavioral problems.  There  has  been no \nprofessional  assessment  of  whether  L. C. ' s  mother  can  presently \nmanage  if she  had  sufficient  resources  and  support. \nOver  the past two months,  GRH-A  has  encouraged L.C.'s mother \nto  have  her  visit  on  weekends,  provided  that  the  mother  pick  up \nL.C.  and  return  her  to  the  hospital.  The  mother,  however,  has \nmanaged  only  two  visitations.  During  the  entire three years  that \nL.C.  has been in the hospital,  her mother visited with L.C.  only on \nholidays.  In fact,  GRH-A  is so concerned about the mother's ability \nto  properly  care  for  L.C.,  that  it has  refused  to  make  her  the \nrepresentative  payee  for  L.C.'s  disability checks. \nL. C.  has  already  suffered  irreparable  harm  due  to  repeated \ninstances of lengthy, inappropriate psychiatric confinement without \nmental  retardation  habilitation  services.  She  sought  judicial \nintervention  as  a  last  resort  after  she  made  every  good  faith \neffort  to  secure  the  services  she  needed.  If  the  defendants  are \npermitted  to  discharge  L.C.  from  their  legal  custody  without \nappropriate planning and  services,  L.C.  will unquestionably suffer \nirreparable  harm  once  again. \nPlaintiff contends,  first,  that Title II of the Americans with \nDisabilities  Act,  42  U.S.C.  §  12132  (Supp.  1993)  and  its \nimplementing regulations at 28  C.F.R.  §  35.101  et seq.  (the  \"ADA\") \ndo  not permit  the  state to keep her in an  institution where  she  is \nsegregated from  the community unless  segregation would be the most \n3 \n\neffective  way  to  provide  her  with  the  services  she  needs. \nSpecifically,  she  bases  her  ADA  claim  on  the  requirement  that \npublic  entities  must  provide  services  in  the  most  integrated \nsetting  appropriate  to  the  needs  of  the  disabled.  28  C.F.R.  § \nv. \n35.130(d);  Helen  L.  DiDario,  46  F.3d  325  (3rd  Cir.  1995). \nIn addition  to  the ADA,  Plaintiff  relies  on  her  substantive \ndue  process  rights  under  the  14th Amendment  to minimally \nadequate  habilitation  as  determined  by  the  exercise  of  qualified \nprofessional  judgment.  The current professional  judgment of L. C. ' s \nhospital  treatment  staff  and  other  evaluators  over  the  years  has \nbeen consistent -- L.C.'s substantial needs  for habilitation cannot \nbe  properly  addressed  in  a  psychiatric  hospital.  Although \nplaintiff  does  not  assert  a  constitutional  right  to  community \nservices,  she  does  contend  that,  once  the  state has  involuntarily \ncommitted  her,  she  is  constitutionally  entitled  to  minimally \nadequate  treatment  and  habilitation  based  on  the  individual \ncircumstances  of  her  case.  At  a  minimum  that  should  include  such \ntraining  as  is  necessary  to  prevent  deterioration  of  basic  self \ncare  skills  and  to  remedy  the  detrimental  effect  of  her  years  of \ninappropriate  confinement.  See  Youngberg  v.  Romeo,  457  U.S.  307, \n102  S.  Ct.  2452  (1982);  Thomas  S.  v.  Morrow,  781  F.2d  367  (4th \nCir.),  cert.  denied,  476  U.S.  1124,  and  cert.  denied,  479  U.S.  869 \n(1986). \nII.  STATEMENT  OF  FACTS \nPlaintiff is an attractive,  sociable 27  year old woman who  has \nlived  more  than  half  of  her  life  since  age  14  in  psychiatric \n4 \n\nhospitals,  admitted generally as a  result of  threatening behavior, \nassaults,  or a  general  inability to  care  for  herself.  (Affidavit \nof  Cecelia  Kimble,  Ph. D.,  Exhibit  B,  Par.  9 )  She  has  been \ndiagnosed  with  schizophrenia  and  moderate  mental  retardation  and \nhas  many  cognitive  and  adaptive  limitations,  placing  her  in  the \nequivalent range  of  a  5  year old or below in many  areas.  (Exhibit \nB,  Par.  16-21) \nBecause of her mental disabilities,  she has  experienced great \ndifficulties  in  her  life,  most  of  which  result  from  her  behavior \nwhen she is frustrated,  fearful,  or unable to understand.  (Exhibit \nB,  Par.  25,  30)  There is also an early reported history of alcohol \nabuse  by  her  mother  and  other  problems  in  the  home  during  L.C.'s \nchildhood.  Plaintiff  has  not  lived  at  home  for  more  than  very \nbrief periods since she began a  long history of hospitalizations as \na  young  teenager.  Her  first documented  admission to GRH-A  in 1980 \nwas  to  the  adolescent  unit.  After  more  than  a  year,  she  was \nreleased.  Seven  months  later,  she  was  readmitted  and  held  four \nmonths.  She was  released and  readmitted three months  later.  This \ntime  she was  hospitalized  for another seven months  and discharged. \nBy  age  17,  the  pattern  of  psychiatric  confinement  was  well \nestablished.  Hospitalizations  were  sometimes  for  a  few  days  but \nmore  often  five  or  six months  and  then,  in  1988,  she was  confined \nfor  more  than  two  years.  The  intervals  between  hospitalizations \nvaried  from  a  few  days  to nine  months.  (Exhibit A) \nThe  longest  interval  (nine  months  from  June,  1991  to  March, \n1992)  was  the  only  period  when,  after  persistent  advocacy  on  her \n5 \n\nbehalf,  she  was  provided  with  a  community  service  placement  with \nsome  supports.  Beginning. in March of  1992,  she began to experience \nan  acute  phase  of  her  mental  illness  and  to  engage  in  some \naggressive  and  threatening  behaviors.  The  episode  has  been \nattributed  to  stress,  related  to a  conflict with  community  staff. \nHer community service provider felt that more resources were needed \nto  serve  L.C.  appropriately,  at  least  in her  first year  or  so  out \nof an institution and.L.C.,  herself,  felt that she should return to \nthe  hospital.  Her  community  placement  slot  was  lost,  and  no \naddi tional  resources  were  provided  (or  sought)  to  assist  that \nparticular provider. \nPlaintiff's  current  hospitalization began  with  her  admission' \nto Georgia  Regional  Hospital  at Atlanta  on  May  11,  1992.  She  has \nresided  in  the  hospital  on  the  \"treatment  unit\"  since  that  date. \n(Exhibit  B,Par.  10)  On  May  11,  1995,  exactly three years  later, \nthis  case  was  filed,  alleging  that  Defendants'  confinement  of \nPlaintiff violated certain statutory and constitutional rights.  On \nMay  19,  1995,  eight  days  after  the  case  was  filed,  Plaintiff  was \nabruptly  released  to  her mother  on  a  two  week  \"trial visit.\"  On \nJune  2,  1995,  without  returning  to  the  hospital,  GRH-A  intends  to \n\"discharge\"  Plaintiff  from  its  custody. \nA  principal  theme  apparent  throughout  her  current \nhospitalization  and  reflected  in  both  recent  and  earlier \nevaluations  is that,  although L.C.  is considered to have  a  thought \ndisorder,  she  does  not  need  and  should  not  be  confined  for  any \nlength  of  time  in a  mental  hospital  once  the  thought  disorder  has \n6 \n\nstabilized.  (Exhibit  B,  Par.  11,  23,  25,  26-37)  For  Plaintiff, \nwhose  ability to comprehend her environment  is at an  extremely low \nlevel,  life  at  GRH-A  is  likely  to  result  in  regression  or  the \ndevelopment  of  additional maladaptive  behavior.  (Exhibit  B,  Par. \n28)  In  fact,  L.C.  'has  both  deteriorated  and  regressed  at  the \nhospital  since  her  admission  in  1992.  (Exhibit  B,  Par.  29) \nIn January,  1986,  when Plaintiff was  18 and confined at GRH-A, \nshe  was  evaluated  by  the  DeKalb  County  Health  Department \nDevelopmental  Evaluation  Clinic.  Ms.  Bess· Ligon,  her  current \nsocial  worker  at  GRH-A,  accompanied  her.  The  evaluating \npsychologist  concluded  that  she  \"would  benefit  from  a  structured, \nresidential  facility where  she  could  be  maintained  on  medication \nand  involved  in vocational  training activities,  such  as  an  ICF/MR \n[intermediate  care  facility  for  mentally  retarded].  'If  her \nmaladaptive  behaviors  are  able  to  be  controlled,  a  community \nplacement might  be  considered  .  .  .  .  It would  be more  valuable to \nview  her  from  a  developmental  rather  than  a  psychiatric \nperspective.\"  (Evaluation of DeKalb County Developmental Evaluation \nClinic,  Exhibit  C) \nIn  April,  1988,  again  at  GRH-A,  she  was  evaluated  by  the \nDeKalb  Clinic  and  the  evaluator  reported  that  \"[I]t was  strongly \nfelt that,  since L.'s behavior continues to be self-destructive and \nshe  requires  constant  supervision,  she  needs  to  be  referred to  an \nICF-MR  facility  .  .  This  evaluator  reiterates  the  statement \nmade  in  the  prior  evaluation,  that  is,  to  ' treat  her  from  a \ndevelopmental rather than a  psychiatric perspective. ,,,  (Evaluation \n7 \n\nof  DeKalb  County  Developmental  Clinic,  Exhibit  D)  Plaintiff \nremained,. however,  in  the mental  hospital  for  two  years  after the \nevaluation  (See Exhibit A),  was  released to an unstructured setting \nwith no  habilitation services,andwasre-admitted to the hospital \none  month  later where  she  remained  for  another  year. \nDr.  Cecelia  Kimble,  a  clinical  psychologist,  in  a  recent \nevaluation,  stated  specifically  that  she  concurred  with  the \nconclusion of  the  1986  and  1988  evaluation teams that  \"it would be \nmore  valuable  to  view  (L.C.)  from  a  developmental  rather  than  a \npsychia tric perspective.\"  ( Exhibi t  B,  Par.  26,  37)  Dr.  Kimble was \nalso emphatic that L.C.  was  at risk of deterioration and regression \nin her current circumstances  and that her need  for an appropriate, \nalternative was  critical.  (Exhibit  B,  Par.  28-37)  Her  opinion \nwas  and is that  \"a community based supervised living environment is \ndefinitely indicated for L.C.'s protection and basic well-being and \nto  provide  any  possibility  to  acquire  and  maintain  behaviors \nrequired for basic activities of daily living  .  .  .  .  Any return to \npsychiatric  hospitalization  should  be  avoided  if  at  all  possible \nand,  if required,  be  used only briefly for crisis intervention.\" \nIt has also been clear to L.C.'s current GRH-A  staff that L.C. \ndoes  not need to be in the treatment unit.  Beyond stabilization of \nher  thought  disorder,  L. C.  has  otherwise  been  treated  only  for \nbehavior problems which the professional staff themselves associate \nwith mental  retardation ..  The  focus  of  staff  concern  has  been  her \nneed for appropriate placement.  Her treating psychiatrist noted as \nearly as  June,  1993,  that her thought processes  had  been organized \n8 \n\nfor  the past month.' ( Exhibit  B,  Par.  10,  11)  A  social worker  had \nalready contacted mental  retardation services in February of  1993, \nalthough there is no  indication of  a  response.  (Composite  exhibit \nof  portions  of  L.C.'s  hospital  records,  Exhibit  E-l)  A  community \ncontact  note  indicates  that,  nevertheless,  as  of  August,  1993, \nthere  was  little,  if  any,  focus  on  locating  alternatives  to \ninpatient  psychiatric  confinement.  (Exhibit  E-2) \nBy  November  of  1993,  the  nursing  staff  were  indicating  in \nL.C.'s  medical  records  that  L.C.  was  \"stable  medically  and \nphysically\"  and  that  the  treatment  challenge  was  to  \"maintain \nhighest  level of  functioning  until placement.\"  (Exhibit  E-3)  She \nwas  considered  to  be  at  \"baseline.\"  (Exhibit  E-4)  In  January of \n1994,  her physician expressed the obvious view of GRH-A  staff that \n\"placement  still  a  problem\".  (Exhibit  E-S)  Mr.  Brazee, \nPlaintiff's  social  worker  was  aware  in  November,  when  he  assumed \nresponsibility  for  her  case,  that  it was  the  opinion  of  L.C.'s \nphysician that she should not be hospitalized and that she remained \nat  GRH-A  solely  because  there  were  no  al ternativ  e  placements. \n(Affidavit  of  Randy  Brazee,  Exhibit  F,  Par.  11,  12)  This  was \nfinally noted on  the treatment plan as  reflecting the consensus  of \nthe  entire  treatment  team  in June,  1994.  (Exhibit  B,  Par.  10) \nIn  the  Fall  of  1992,  L.C.  was  notified  that  she was  about  to \nreceive  a  lump  sum  social  security disability payment  and  regular \nmonthly  checks  in  the  amount  of  about  $380.00  per  month.  The \nhospital  applied  to become  her representative  payee  for  all  funds \nrecei ved  and  then  applied  the  lump  sum  and  each  monthly  check \n9 \n\nthereafter towards  the cost of  her institutional care and  a  burial \nfund.  Medicare  coverage,  to  which  L.C.  was  entitled,  was  neveJ:;' \nclaimed  until  several months  agoo  (Composite  exhibit of  finance \nrelated  correspondence,  Exhibit  G) \nEfforts  to  secure  mental  retardation  services  in  connection \nwith  an  alternative  placement  and  other  community  services  by  the \nhospital staff have been fruitless  Mro  Brazee,  recognizing a  need \n0 \nfor an  appropriate placement and  program for LoCo  in the community \nthat  could  provide  supervision  and  habilitation  for  a  person with \nLoC.'s  limitations,  initiated a  prolonged correspondence on L.C.'s \nbehalf  which  elicited either  negative  results  or  no  responses  at \nall.  (Exhibit F,  Par.  27-32 and attachments marked  \"Exhibits 1,  2, \n3\" )  As  recently  as  April,  1995,  Plaintiff's  attorney  submitted \nanother  request  for  mental  retardation  services  and  copies  of \nprevious  evaluations  to  the  Fulton  County  mental  retardation \nevaluation  team.  (Exhibit  H) \nThe  reasons  for  maintaining  L.C.  in  a  psychiatric  hospital \ncontrary to the professional  judgment of the patient's own treating \nstaff  are  not  clear  other  than  what  appears  to  be  a  persistent \nperception  on  the  part  of  GRH-A  staff  that  placing  L.C.  in  the \ncommunity  would  be  difficult  and  one  written  response  from  a \nhospital  administrator  indicating  that  the  state's  \"medicaid \nwaiver\"  program for mentally retarded individuals is unavailable to \npersons in mental hospitals.  (Exhibit F,  Attachment 1)  Both views \nare  erroneous. \nAlthough Plaintiff's staff are adept at the crisis management \n10 \n\nof  mental  illness,  they are  not  mental  retardation professionals. \n(Exhibit B,  Par.  27,  31,  32;  Exhibit F,  Par.  7,  8)  In the words  of \nDr.  Kimble,  \"GRH-A  is  appropriate  for  and  intended  only  to  be  a \n'holding'  environment  for  crisis  intervention  and  medication \nstabilization.\"  (Exhibit  B,  Par.  27) \nL.C. ' s  hospital  record  is  replete  with  examples  of  staff's \napparent  lack  of  understanding  that her  abilities are  limited and \nthat  she  will  not  progress  without  appropriate  community-based \ntraining  designed  for  mentally  retarded  adults.  Wi thout  an \nappropriate  program,  L.C.  becomes  frustrated  and  engages  in  the \nbehaviors  that  have  persistently  interfered  with  her  ability  to \nlive  successfully  with  others.  (Exhibit  B,  Par.  25-37)  Also, \nthere  seems  to  be  a  lack  of  belief  or  understanding  among  GRH-A \nstaff that community placements for persons with mental retardation \nwould,  necessarily,  have  structure  and  supervision  and  that \nmentally  retarded  persons  with  L.C.'s  needs  and  behaviors  can  and \ndo  live  outside  institutions,  even  if  they  experience  occasional \nmental  health  crises.  (Affidavit  of  Michael  Biggs,  Exhibit  I; \nExhibit  F,  Par.  41) \nExamples  from  L.C.'s  hospital  record  reflect  this  lack  of \nexperience with her limitations and  behavior and with the types of \nbehavioral  programs, that  L.C.  needs.  With  reference  to  a \n\"communications  group,\"  the  group  leader  observes  that  \"as  the \ngroup  progressed,  L.  became  fidgety,  moving  around  the  room,  no \nlonger wanting  to  participate in  the  group  and  asking  to  go  smoke \ncigarettes.\"  (Exhibit E-6)  \"[S]he displayed much  difficulty with \n11 \n\nstaying  on  topic  \"  (Exhibit  E-7)  \"[S]he  can't  seem  to \ncomprehend  simple  directions  at  times.

Will \nfile  for  commitment \"\".  (Exhibit  E-ll)  A  few  months  later,  he \nstates,  \"Problem with L.  is that she needs  to work  consistently for \nlonger  periods  of  time  and  at that point  she would  be  ready  to be \n-\" \nin  the  community.\"  ( Exhibit  E-12)  \"Needs  constant  structure. \nThis  is the main problem preventing from placing her.  She has poor \nsocial  skills.  She  becomes  demanding  and  very  intrusive.  She \ncould  not  attend  social  skills  training.\"  (Exhibit  E-13)  \"Needs \nconstant reminder to keep distance when talking to staff and peers. \nShe  remembers  for  some  time  and  goes  back  to  same  thing  • \nNeed  constant  reminder  to  keep  her  face  clean  .  •  Because  of \nthe  above  problem,  placement  becomes  difficult.\"  (Exhibit  E-14) \nThese  staff  comments  show  a  sad  lack  of  understanding  that  the \nbehaviors  L.C.  exhibits  are  not  unusual  for  a  person  whose \nabilities and maturity are comparable to a  young child.  They would \nbe  addressed  in  a  program  plan  but  they would  certainly not  be  a \nbarrier to  living outside  of  a  mental  hospital. \nThe  state  does  operate  community  programs  for  mentally \n12 \n\ndisabled individuals.  (\"Trends and Milestones, ,,'Mental Retardation. \nDecember,  1994,  Exhibit  J;  excerpts  from  document  showing  state \nfunding  for  mental  retardation  community  services,  Exhibit  K; \nExhibit  I)  The  cost  of  institutional  care  for  Plaintiff  is  at \nleast $75,000.00  per year.  The  cost of  an  appropriate,  supervised \ncommunity  placement  operated  by  an  individual  with  extensive \nexperience with providing community residential services to persons \nwith mental  retardation  is about one  fourth  that amount.

P.  65,  Plaintiff  is  entitled  to  a  a \ntemporary  restraining  order  or  preliminary  injunction  if  she \ndemonstrates  (1)  a  substantial likelihood of success on the merits; \n(2)  a  threat  of  irreparable  injury  if  the  TRO  or  preliminary \ninjunction is not granted;  (3)  that such  injury outweighs  the harm \nthat  the  TRO  and  preliminary  injunction  will  cause  to  the \nDefendants;  and  (4)  that the TRO  and  preliminary injunction are in \nthe public interest.

As  will  more  fully  appear  below,  the  Plaintiff  meets \nthese  standards  and  is  entitled  to  a  temporary  restraining  order \nand  a  preliminary injunction  in  this  case. \nB.  LIKELIHOOD  OF  SUCCESS  ON  THE  MERITS \nPlaintiff is substantially likely to succeed on the merits of \n13 \n\nher  claim  that  Defendants'  involuntary  confinement  of  her  in  the \nsegregated  institutional  setting  of  a  mental  hospital,  without \nappropriate  treatment  and  contrary  to  the  judgment  of  qualified \nprofessionals,  violates  her  rights  under  the  Americans  with \nDisabilities  Act,  42  U.S.C.  §  12101  et  seg.,  and  §  1983  of  the \nCivil  Rights  Act. \n1.  DEFENDANTS  ARE  VIOLATING  THE  ADA  BY  SEGREGATING \nPLAINTIFF  IN  A  STATE  HOSPITAL  THAT  DOES  NOT  PROVIDE \nAPPROPRIATE  SERVICES \na.  The  ADA:  Its  Background,  History,  and  Purpose \nThe ADA  is a  major and comprehensive civil rights law designed \nto address' this country's history of rampant discrimination against \nthe disabled.  Congress  recognized that discrimination against the \ndisabled,  often  in  the  form  of  segregation  and  isolation,  was  a \npervasive  social  problem.  It therefore  passed  legislation,  which \nin  the words  of  the  House  Judiciary Committee,  ..  promises  a \nnew  future:  a  future  of  inclusion and  integration,  and  the  end  of \nexclusion  and  segregation.\"  1990  U.S.C.C.A.N.  445,  449. \nTitle  II  of  the ADA  states  that: \n[N]o  qualified  individual  with  a \ndisability,  shall  by  reason  of  such \ndisability,  be  excluded  from  participation  in \nor  be  denied  the  benefits  of  the  services, \nprograms,  or activities of a  public entity,  or \nbe  subjected  to  discrimination  by  any  such \nentity .. \n42  U.S.C.  §  12132.  In passing this provision,  Congress  explicitly \nstated  its purpose: \nTo  provide  a  clear and  comprehensive  national \nmandate  for  the  elimination  of  discrimination \nagainst  individuals  with  disabilities. \n14 \n\n42  U.S.C.  §  12101(b)(1) \nThe purpose of Title II of the ADA  and its anti-discrimination \nprovision were  supported by strong congressional findings  of wide-\nspread discriminat'ion,  segregation,  and  isolation of  persons ,with \ndisabilities with  no  legal  recourse.  Those  findings  were  codified \nin the Act  itself: \n(a)  Findings \nThe  Congress  finds  that  -\n(2)  Historically, society has tended to isolate and segregate \nindividuals  with  disabilities,  and,  despite  some \nimprovements,  such  forms  of  discrimination  against \nindividuals  with  disabilities  continue  to  be  a  serious \nand  pervasive  social  problem; \n(3)  Discrimination  against  individuals  with  disabilities \npersists  in  such  critical areas  as  employment,  housing, \npublic  accommodations,  education,  transportation, \ncommunication,  recreation,  institutionalization,  health \nservices,  voting,  and  access  to  public  services; \n(4)  ... Individuals who  have experienced discrimination on \nthe basis of disability have often had no  legal recourse \nto  redress  such  discrimination; \n(5)  Individuals  with  disabilities  continually  encounter \nvarious  forms  of  discrimination,  including  outright \nintentLonal  exclusion,  .  overprotective  rules  and \npolicies,  failure  to  make  modifications  to  existing \nfacilities  and  practices,  exclusionary  qualification \nstandards  and  criteria,  segregation,  and  relegation  to \nlesser services, programs, activities, benefits,  jobs ,or \nother opportunities; \n(8)  The  Nation ',s  proper  goals  regarding  individuals  with \ndisabilities are to assure equality of opportunity,  full \nparticipation,  independent  living,  and  economic  self \nsufficiency for  such  individuals  .  .  .  .' \n42  U.S.C.  §  12101(a)(2),(3),(4),(5)  and  (8)  (Emphasis  added). \nThe legislative history resolves any doubt that could possibly \nremain regarding the purpose of the ADA  to prohibit segregation and \n15 \n\nunnecessary institutionalization of the disabled.  Numerous members \nof  the  House  and  Senate  expressly stated their support  for  an  end \nto discrimination against the disabled through passage of  the ADA. \nFor  example,  Senator  Tom  Harkin,  floor  manager  of  the  ADA  in  the \nSenate,  stated  that  the  ADA  \"guarantees  individuals  with \ndisabilities  the  right  to  be  integrated  into  the  economic  and \nsocial mainstream  of  society;  segregation and  isolation by others \nwill  no  longer  be  tolerated.\"  135  Congo  Rec.  19803  (1989) \n(Emphasis  added).  In  a  similar  vein,  Representative  Collins  put \nforth the  \"basic goal which runs through this landmark civil rights \nthat  goal  is  to  fully  integrate  disabled  Americans \nlegislation~ \ninto  all  aspects  of  life  in  our  country.\"  136  Congo  Rec.  11430 \n(1990)  (Emphasis  added).  Congressman  Miller  recognized  that  \"it \nhas been our unwillingness to see all people with disabilities that \nhas  been  the  greatest  barrier  to  full  and  meaningful  equality. \nSociety has made them invisible by shutting them away in segregated \nfacilities.\"  136  Congo  Rec.  10877  (1990)  (Emphasis  added). \nSenator  Kennedy  argued  that  the  ADA  would  put  an  end  to  this \nunnecessary segregation:  \"the Americans with Disabilities Act will \nend  this American  apartheid.  It will  roll back  the unthinking and \nunacceptable  practices  by  which  disabled  Americans  today  are \nsegregated,  excluded,  and fenced off from fair participation in our \nsociety.\"  135  Congo  Rec.  8514  (1989)  (Emphasis  added). \nLast,  and  perhaps  most  eloquently,  former  Senator  Lowell \nWeicker,  the  original  sponsor  of  the  ADA  and  former  Chair  of  the \nSenate  Subcommittee  on  the  Handicapped,  testified  before  that \n16 \n\ncommittee  that  the  intent  of  the  ADA  was  to  end  isolation, \nsegregation,  and  discrimination: \nFor years  this country has maintained a  public \npolicy  of  protectionism  toward  people  with \ndisabilit ies.  We  have  created  monoliths  of \nisolated  care  in  institutions  and  in \nsegregated  educational  settings.  It  is  that \nisolation and  segregation  that has  become  the \nbasis  of  the  discrimination  faced  by  many \ndisabled people today.  Separate is not equal. \nIt  was'  not  for  blacks;  it  is  not  for  the \ndisabled. \nAmericans  with Disabilities Act Hearing  Before the Senate Comm.  on \nLabor  and  Human  Resources  and  Sub-comm.  on  the  Handicapped,  101st \nCong.,  1st Sess.  215  (1989)  (Emphasis  added). \nFederal  regulations  implementing  the  ADA  comport  with  the \nabove  legislative  findings  and  history by  providing  that: \nA  public  entity  shall  administer  services, \nprograms,  and  activities  in  the  most \nintegrated setting appropriate to the needs  of \nqualified  individuals  with  disabilities. \n28  C.F.R.  §  35.130(d)  (1993)  (Emphasis  added).  In  mandating \nadministration  of  services  in  \"the  most  integrated  setting\",  the \nDepartment  of  Justice  has  described  that  setting  as  one  \"that \nenables  individuals with disabilities to interact with nondisabled \npersons  to  the  fullest  extent  possible.\"  28  C.F.R.  Part  35,  App. \nA  at  454.  Furthermore,  the  Department  of  Justice  has  made  clear \nthat  \"[s]eparate,  special,  or different programs  that are designed \nto provide a  benefit to persons with disabilities cannot be used to \nrestrict the participation of persons with disabilities in general, \nintegrated  activities.\"  Id.  at  452.  Thus,  the  Department  of \nJustice  summarized  the meaning  and  intent of  the ADA  implementing \n17 \n\nregulations  to  prohibit exclusion  and  segregation: \nTaken  together,  these  provisions  are  intended \nto  prohibit  exclusion  and  segregation  of \nindividuals  with  disabilities  and  the  denial \nof  equal  opportunities  enjoyed  by  others, \nbased  on,  among  other  things,  presumptions, \npatronizing  attitudes,  fears,  and  stereotypes \nof  individuals with disabilities.  Consistent \nwith  these  standards,  public  entities  are \nrequired  to  insure  that  their  actions  are \nbased  on  facts  applicable  to  individuals  and \nnot  on  assumptions  as  to  what  a  class  of \nindividuals  with  disabilities  can  or  cannot \ndo. \nIntegration  is  fundamental  to  the  purposes  of \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act.  Provision \nof  segregated  accommodations  and  services \nrelegates  persons  with disabilities  to  second \nclass  status. \nId.  at  451  (Emphasis  added). \nThis  commentary  to  the  regulations  is  consistent  with  the \nreport of the House Judiciary Committee which emphasized integrated \nservices: \nAs  with Section 504  of the Rehabilitation Act, . \nintegrated  services  are  essential  to \naccomplishing  the  purposes  of  Title  II.  As \nstated by  Judge  Mansmann  in ADAPT  v.  Skinner, \n\"the  goal  [is  to]  eradicate  the  'invisibility \nof  the  handicapped.'\"  .  .  Integration  is \nfundamental  to  the  purposes  of  the ADA. \nHouse  Report  No.  485  at  50,  56  (Emphasis  added). \nAs  will  be  shown  below,  L.C.  has  been  excluded,  segregated, \nisolated,  and  discriminated  against  based  upon  her  disability  by \nthe Defendants in violation of the express  language of the ADA,  the \nexpress  language  of  the  ADA's  implementing  regulations,  and  the \nexpress  intent of  the  U.S.  Congress  summarized  above. \n18 \n\nb.  L.C.  Is  a  Qualified  Individual  With  a  Disability \nWithin  The  Meaning  Of  The  ADA,  Is  The  Victim Of \nDiscrimination  By  a  Public  Entity,  And  Has  Been \nDiscriminated Against  Based  Upon  Her  Disability \nIn  order  to  prove  a  violation  of  Title  II  of  the  ADA, \nPlaintiff  must  demonstrate  the  existence  of  three  elements:  (1) \nthat  she  is  a  \"qualified  individual  with\"a  disability\";  (2)  that \nshe  was  the  victim of  discrimination by a  public  entity;  (3)  that \nsuch  discrimination was  by  reason  of  a  disability.  See  Concerned \nParents  to Save  Dreher Park Center v.  the City of West  Palm  Beach, \n846  F.  Supp.  986,  990  (S.D.  Fla.  1994). \ni.  L.C.  is clearly a  qualified  individual with a  disability. \nThe  ADA  defines  a  disability  as  \"(A)  a  physical  or.  mental \nimpairment  that substantially limits one  or more  of  the major  life \nactivities of  such  individual;  (B)  a  record of  such  impairment;  or \n(C)  is  regarded  as  having  such  an  impairment.\"  42  U.S.C.  § \n12102(2)(A)-(C).  L.C.  is  mentally  retarded  and  suffers  from \nschizophrenia  which  is  presently  controlled.  She  has  verbally-\nmediated  intellectual  functioning  below  40  and  non-verbal \nfunctioning  in' the  6 Os.  She  is  27  years  old  with  arithmetic \nabilities  equivalent  to  a  person. five  and  one  half  years  old  and \nreading  skills  e.quivalent  to  a  person  six  and  one  half  to  seven \nyears  old.  (Exhibit  B,  Par.  17-21)  She  clearly  suffers  from  a \ndisabili ty  that  substantially  interferes  with  major  life \nactivities.  She  also  has  a  long  record  of  suffering  from  this \nimpairment  and  has  long  been  regarded  as  suffering  from  such  an \nimpairment.  She is therefore an individual with a  disability within \nthe meaning  of  the Act. \n19 \n\nL.C.  is also  a  qualified  individual  under  the ADA.  Not  only \ndoes  she  have  a  disability  within  the  meaning  of  the  Act,  she \nclearly  qualifies  for  the  community  services  which  she  seeks  in \nthis case.  See Martin v.  Voinovich,  840  F.  Supp.  1175,  1191-92  (S. \nD.  Ohio  1993).  (Persons  with mental  retardation or developmental \ndisabilities  who  could  participate  in  a  community  residential \nservices program were  considered qualified for such  services under \nthe  ADA).  As  the  attached  affidavit  of  Dr.  M.  Cecelia  Kimble,  a \nclinical  psychologist,  illustrates,  L. C.  requires  a  supervised \nliving  environment  outside  the  hospital  with  appropriate  health, \neducational and vocational training.  (Exh.  B,  Par.  35)  Indeed,  the \nDefendants  have  admitted  on  numerous  occasions,  as  documented  in \nL.C.'s  medical  records,  that  she  needs  an  alternative  community \nplacement  outside  the  hospital.  Thus,  by  Defendants  own \nadmissions,  L.C.  is qualified  for  community-based  treatment. \nii.  Defendants  Have  Discriminated Against  L.C.  By  Continuing \nTo  Institutionalize And  Segregate  Her  In  a  Mental \nHospital \nThe  text  of  the  ADA,  its  legislative  history,  and  its \nimplementing  regulations  as  already  discussed  at  length  above  in \nSection III  (B)(1)(a) unequivocally establish a  national mandate to \nend  unnecessary  segregation  and  institutionalization  of  persons \nlike  L.C.  and  to  integrate  such  persons  into  society at  large  to \nthe  greatest  extent  possible.  The  Act,  legislative  history,  and \nimplementing  regulations  make  equally  clear  that  when  Defendants \nfail  to  comply with  this mandate,  they  commit  discrimination. \nSeveral court decisions have  strongly affirmed the point that \n20 \n\nunnecessary segregation is discrimination per seD  The best example \nis  the  recent  case  of  Helen  L.  v.  DiDario,  46F.3d  325  (3rd  Cir. \n1995)  which  concluded: \nThus,  the  ADA  and  its  attendant  regulations \nclearly  define  unnecessary  segregation  as  a \nform  of  illegal  discrimination  against  the \ndisabled.  Accordingly,  the  district  court \nerred  in  holding  that  the  applicable \nprovl.sl.ons  of  the  ADA  'may  not  be  invoked \nunless  there  is  first  a  finding  of \ndiscrimination.' \nId.  at  333. \nOther  decisions  interpreting the ADA  and  its predecessor, \n§  504  of  the Rehabilitation Act,  have  reached the same  conclusion. \nSee Halderman  v.  Pennhurst State Sch.  and  Hosp.,  784  F.  Supp.  215, \n224  (E.D.

As  noted  recently  by  the  Third  Circuit  in  the \nDiDario  caseg \n[b]ecause  the  ADA  evolved  from  an  attempt  to \nremedy  the  effects  of  \"benign  neglect\" \nresulting  from  the  \"invisibility\"  of  the \ndisabled,  Congress  could  not  have  intended  to \nlimit  the  Act's  protections  and  prohibitions \nto  circumstances  involving  deliberate \ndiscrimination.  Such  discrimination  results \nfrom  \"affirmative  animus\"  which  was  not  the \nfocus  of  the  ADA  Rather,  the  ADA \nattempts  to  eliminate  the  effects  of  that \n\"benign neglect\",  \"apathy\",  and  \"indifference\" \n[T]he  ADA  make [ s]  clear  that  the \nunnecessary  segregation  of  individuals  with \ndisabilities  in  the  prOV1S1on  of  public \nservices  is  itself a  form  of  discrimination. \n46  F.3rd  at  335.

Public  entities  may  provide  different  services  to \npersons  with  disabilities  if  \"necessary  to  provide  qualified \nindividuals with disabilities with aids, benefits, or services that \nare  as  effective  as  those  provided  to  others.\"  28  C.F.R.  § \n35.130(b)(1)(iv)(1993)  (Emphasis added).  The Department of Justice \nwhich promulgated this regulation has indicated that this exception \nto  the  general  rule  of  integration  is  a  narrow  one:  \"[s]eparate, \nspecial  or  different  programs  that  are  designed  to  provide  a \nbenefit to persons with disabilities cannot be used to restrict the \nparticipation of  persons  with  disabilities  in  general,  integrated \nactivities.\"  28  C.F.R.  Part  35,  App.  A  at  452. \nFurthermore,  Defendants  have  the  burden  of  showing  that \nseparate or segregated services are necessary to provide effective \nservices.  The  state  can  do  this  only  after  making  an \nindividualized  determination  of  L.C.'s  needs.  Id.  As  the \nDepartment  of  Justice  has  noted,  \"[t]he  starting  point  is  to \nquestion  whether  the  separate  program  is  in· fact  necessary  or \nappropriate  for  the  individual.\"  Id.  (Emphasis  added). \nThe  Defendants  in  this  case  cannot  meet  their  burden.  In \nfact,  they  have  repea tedl y  acknowledged  that  L  C .  no  longer \n0 \nrequires  institutionalization  and  is  eligible  for  a  community \nplacement.  They  have  abjectly failed,  however,  to  place  her  in a \n23 \n\nresidential  supervised  setting  wi~h appropriate  services.  They \nhave therefore  against L.C.  within the meaning of the \ndiscri~inated \nADA. \nFinally,  Plaintiff  is  not  required  to  show  that  she  has  been \ndenied  access  to  services  as  a  disabled person  that  are  available \nto the nondisabled.  In other words,  simply because Plaintiff seeks \naccess  to  services  that  are  available  only  to  persons  with \ndisabilities  does  not  alter  the  analysis.  The  key  is  the  plain \nlanguage  of  the  ADA  which  prohibits  unnecessary  segregation  and \nisolation of individuals with disabilities.  That alone constitutes \ndiscrimination. \nThus,  courts  have  rejected  the  argument  that  discrimination \noccurs  only  if  disabled  persons  are  denied  services  that  are \navailable  to  the  nondisabled.  DiDario,  46  F.3rd at  335  (\". \nthe  ADA  make[s]  clear  that  the  unnecessary  segregation  of \nindividuals with  disabilities  in the  provision of  public  services \nis  itself  a  form  of  discrimination  within  the  meaning  of  those \nstatutes,  independent  of  the  discrimination  that  arises  when \nindividuals with disabilities receive different services than those \nprovided  to  individuals  without  disabilities.\");  Martin  v. \nVoinovich,  840  F.  Supp.  1175,  1191-92  (S.D.  Ohio  1993). \nIn  sum,  by  unnecessarily  segregating  and  institutionalizing \nL.C.,  Defendants  thereby  discriminated  against  her  within  the \nmeaning  of  the ADA. \niii.  Defendants  Have  Discriminated Against  Plaintiff  Based \nUpon  Her  Disability \nPlaintiff  has  established  that  Defendants  have  discriminated \n24 \n\nagainst her under the ADA  by unnecessarily excluding,  segregating, \nand  institutionalizing  her.  In  order  to  prevail  under  the  ADA, \nhowever,  Plaintiff  must  also  show  that  Defendants  have  excluded, \nsegregated,  and  institutionalized  .her  \"by  reason  of  [her] \ndisability\".  42  U.S.C.  §  12132.  Defendants  have  unquestionably \ndone  50. \nL. C.  has  a  mental  illness,  schizophrenia,  and  is  mentally \nretarded.  She  has  been  institutionalized  at  GRH ... A  since  1992. \nGRH-A  houses  only persons with mental  illness.  By  Defendants'  own \nadmissions,  L.C.  was  hospitalized in  1992  by  reason  of  her mental \nillness  (schizophrenia).  By  Defendants'  own  admissions  L. C. 's \nmental  illness has  been adequately controlled for at least one  and \none-half years.  L.C.,  however,  has  remained hospitalized until the \nfiling  of  this  lawsuit  and  remains  in  state  custody.  L.C. \nundoubtedly has been forced to remain in the state's custody either \nby reason of her 1)  mental illness or 2)  her mental retardation,  or \n3)  both.  Otherwise,  she would  have  been  unconditionally released \nby  GRH-A  a  long  time  ago. \nFor  purposes  of  violating  the  ADA,  it  does  not  matter  for \nwhich  of  the  above  three  reasons  L.C.  is  being  held.  If  L.C.  is \nbeing  held  for  any  of  those  reasons,  she  is  clearly being  held  by \nreason  of  her  disability.  Consequently,  under  the  ADA,  she  is \nbeing discriminated against  based upon  her disability. \nDefendants may attempt to claim that Plaintiff remains at GRH \nA  because Defendants  iack  funds  to place her  in a  proper community \nresidential  setting  and  provide  her  with  the  necessary  treatment \n25 \n\nand  services.  Such  an  argument  would  be  legally  and  factually \ninsupportable. \nFirst,  such  an  argument  would  really be  nothing more  than  an \nargument  that  Defendants  have  not  intentionally  discriminated \nagainst  L.C.  Plaintiff  has  already noted  in  the  previous  Section \nIII(B)(1)(a)(ii),  however,  that the ADA  does  not  require an  intent \nto discriminate. \nSecond,  continued  institutionalization  based  upon  lack  of \nfunds  has already been rejected by the DiDario  case in the  face of \nan  ADA  claim.  46  F.3d  at  338. \nThird,  just as  in DiDario,  a  claim of  lack of  funds  would  be \nfactually  insupportable.  The  approximate  cost  of  placing  L.C.  in \nan appropriate community residential setting would be substantially \nless than the more than $75,000.00 spent each year to warehouse her \nat GRH-A. \nIt has  long  been  the  law of  this  circuit that a  state may  not \nfail  to  provide  treatment  for  budgetary  reasons  alone.  Wyatt  v. \nAderholt,  503  F.2d  1305,  1315  (5th  Cir.  1974)  As  noted  in  the \nWyatt  case,  \"'[H]umane  considerations  and  constitutional \nrequirements  are  not,  in  this  day,  to  be  measured  or  limited  by \ndollar considerations.'\"  quoting Jackson v.  Bishop,  404  F.2d 571, \n580  (8th Cir.  1968).  See also Concerned Parents to Save Dreher Park \nCenter  v.  City  of, West  Palm  Beach,  846  F.  Supp  at  993  and  n.  15 \n(liThe  expenditure  of  funds  cannot  be  considered  a  harm  if the  law \nrequires  it. \");  Kroll v.  St.  Charles  County,  766  F.  Supp.  744,  753 \n(E.D.  Mo.  1991)  (If  county  did  not  fund  building  improvements \n26 \n\nrequired under  the ADA  within two months,  the Court would  consider \nthe  imposition  of  a  property  tax  increase,  or  an  injunction  of  a \nrollback  of  local  taxes  to  assure  funding  for  the  improvements.) \nThese holdings are particularly pertinent to the ADA  given the \nADA's  legislative  history  which  acknowledged  that  the  ADA  would \nimpose  financial  burdens  on  the  states.  As  Senator Hatch  stated, \nthe ADA  would \nimpose  a  lot  of  expenses  and  rightly  so.  It \nis  time  we  did  these  things.  It  is  time  we \nbr6ught  persons  with  disabilities  into  full \nfreedom,  economic  and  otherwise,  with  other \nci tizens  in  our  society.  This  bill  will  do \nthat.  In doing  so,  we  should be aware  that it \nis  going  to  be  costly and  difficult  and  that \nthere will  be  some  complaints. \n135  Congo  Rec.  19835  (1989).  Senator Harkin echoed this sentiment: \n[F]ocusing  on  the  costs  of  compliance  by \ncovered  entities  was  totally  inappropriate \ngiven  the  economic  benefits  to  society  of \nreducing  the deficit by  getting people  off  of \nwelfare,  out ·of  institutions,  and  on  to  the \ntax  rolls. \n135  Congo  Rec.  8508  (1989).  Clearly,  failing  to  provide \nappropriate services due  to  lack of  funds  is no  defense under  the \nADA. \nTo  summarize,  L.C.  is  a  qualified  individual  with  a \ndisability,  is the victim of discrimination by a  public entity, and \nhas  been  against  based  upon  her disability.  She  is \ndiscriminat~d \ntherefore  entitled to  relief  under  the ADA. \n2.  DEFENDANTS  ARE  VIOLATING  THE  ADA  BY  FAILING  TO  PROVIDE \nINTEGRATED  COMMUNITY-BASED  SERVICES  AS  A  \"REASONABLE \nMODIFICATION\"  UNDER  THE  ADA. \nAs  already  noted  above,  Defendants  must  administer  their \n27 \n\nmental  disability  services  in  the  most  integrated  setting \nappropriate  to  L.C.  See  28  C.F.R.  §  35.130(d)(1993)  For  L. C. , \nthat setting is a  community-based residential setting.  Defendants \nmust  also modify  their programs  to  the extent that  is required  to \navoid  discriminating against  the disabled: \nA  public  enti ty  shall  make  reasonable \nmodifications  in  policies,  practices,  or \nprocedures  when  the  modifications  are \nnecessary to avoid discrimination on the basis \nof  disability,  unless  the  public  entity  can \ndemonstrate  that  making  the  modifications \nwould  fundamentally  alter  the  nature  of  the \nservice,  program,  or activity. \n28  C.F.R.  §  35.130(b)(1}  (Emphasis  added). \nModifications  are  considered  unreasonable  only  if  they \nrequire  a  fundamental  alteration  or  impose  \"undue  financial  and \nadministrative burdens\"  on  the Defendants.  School  Board v.  Arline, \n480  u.S.  273,  287  n.  17,  1987  (interpreting regulations under §  504 \nof  the  Rehabilitation Act). \nThe  regulation  also  makes  clear  that  the  burden  is  on  the \nDefendants to establish a  fundamental alteration or undue financial \nand administrative burdens.  This makes  sense given that the ADA  is \na  remedial  statute.  As  one  court  has  noted,  the ADA  is  \"designed \nto  eliminate discrimination against  the  disabled  in all  facets  of \nsociety\"  and therefore must be  \"broadly construed to effectuate its \npurposes.\"  Kinney  v.  Yerusalim,  812  F.  Supp.  547,  551  (E.D.  PaD \n1992)  [citing Tcherepnin  v.  Knight,  389  u.S.  332  (1967)]  aff'd,  9 \nF.  3d  1067  (3rd  Cir.  1993),  cert.  denied,  ____  u.S.  ____ ,  114  S. \nCt.  1545  (1994).  This  conclusion  is  supported by  the  legislative \nhistory  already  discussed  above  and  more  particularly  by  the \n28 \n\nstatement  from  the House  Judiciary Committee  that  .,[t]he fact that \nit  is  more  convenient,  either  administratively  or  fiscally,  to \nprovide  services  in  a  segregated  manner,  does  not  constitute  a \nvalid  justification for separate or different services under  §  504 \nof  the  Rehabilitation Act,  or under  this  title.\"  House  Report  No. \n485  at  50. \nDefendants  clearly  cannot  meet  their  burden  of  showing  a \nfundamental  alteration  or  undue  financial  and  administrative \nburdens  in  this  case.  Defendants  already  spend  approximately \n$119,000,000  per year  in providing  community  services  to mentally \nretarded  persons.  (  See  Exhibit  K,  p.  2)  Defendants  already have \nan  established program  providing  such  services  to  persons  such  as \nL.C.- such  that  no  fundamental  alteration  in  Defendants'  programs \nwould  be  required. _  In  a  similar  context,  the  Third  Circuit  has \nalready  ruled  that  providing  community-based  services  does  not \nrequire a  fundamental  alteration wi thin the meaning of the ADA.  See \nDiDario,  46  F.3rd  at  337-38;  see also Martin  v.  Voinovich,  840  F. \nSupp.  at  1190-91. \nAdditionally,  given  that  it  costs  substantially  more  to \ninstitutionalize  L.C.  than  it does  to  provide  her  with  necessary \ncommunity-based  services,  Defendants  cannot  possibly  claim  undue \nfinancial _ hardship.  Again,  a  similar  situation  existed  in  the \nDiDario  case,  and  that  court  ruled  that Defendants  could  not  show \nundue  financial  hardship.  46  F.3rd  at  338. \nThe  experience  of  other  states  is  instructive on  this  issue. \nMany  states  are -now  shifting  services  for  people  with  mental \n29 \n\ndisabilities  from  institutional  settings  to  community-based \nsettings.  For  example,  some  states,  including  Vermont, \nMassachusetts,. and  Rhode  Island,  have  closed  a  great  majority  of \ntheir public  psychiatric  beds  and  reallocated  funds  to  community \nbased  services.  Many  states  have  also  eliminated  or  greatly \ndiminished  their  institutional  care  for  people  with  mental \nretardation  and  now  provide  integrated  services  to  a  wide  variety \nof  people  with  mental  retardation  and  dual  diagnoses  of  mental \nillness  and  mental  retardation.  Courts  have  not  been  hesitant  to \nrequire  closure  of  state  mental  retardation  facilities  and  the \ntransfer of mentally disabled people to community placements.  See \nCourt  Plan  and  Order  of  Deinstitutionalization,  Hissom  1987  WL \n27104  at  *222,  *226;  Jackson,  757  F.  Supp.  at  1315-18.  Clearly, \nrequiring  the  Defendants  to  provide  one  individual  with  a \ncommunity-based  program  in  an  integrated  setting  would  not \nconstitute an  undue  administrative  burden. \nIn  sum,  Defendants  cannot  meet  their burden  of  demonstrating \nthat  providing  L.C.  with  an  integrated  community-based  setting \nwould  impose  a  fundamental  alteration on  the  Defendants'  programs \nor  impose  an  undue  financial  or  administrative  burden  on  them. \nDefendants can easily accomplish what L.C.  requests with little, if \nany,  modification  of  its  present  programs  and  services.  Since \nDefendants  steadfastly refuse  to do  so,  it is time  to  order  them \nto do  so. \n30 \n\n3.  PLAINTIFF  IS  LIKELY  TO  PREVAIL  ON  HER  §  1983  CLAIM. \na.  Plaintiff Has A Right to Minimally Adequate Treatment \nAnd  Habilitation  Defined  By  Her  Particular \nCircumstances. \nThe Fourteenth Amendment guarantees substantive due process to \nindividuals  confined  in  state institutions  including  the  right  to \nsafety,  freedom  of  movement,  and  minimally  adequate  treatment  or \nhabilitation.  Youngberg,  457  U.S.  at  318-19.  This  right derives \nfrom  the  long-established  principals  that involuntary confinement \nby  the  state  is  a  \"massive  curtailment  of  liberty\"  Humphrey  v. \nCady,  405  U.S.  504,  509,  92  S.  Ct.  1048,  1052,  (1972),  cannot \ncontinue  once  the  individual  can  live  safely  outside  of  an \ninstitution,  O'Connor  v.  Donaldson,  422  U.S.  563,  95  S.  Ct.  2486 \n(1975)  and  its duration must  be  consistent with the purpose of  the \nconfinement.  Jackson  v.  Indiana,  406  U.S.  715,  ,92  S.  Ct.  1845, \n(1972). \nIn  determining  the  constitutional  standard  for  the  provision \nof  minimally adequate  treatment,  individual  circumstances  must  be \nconsidered.  In  Youngberg,  the  Plaintiff,  \"in  light of  the  severe \ncharacter of his retardation,  concede[d]  that no amount of training \n[would]  make  possible  his  release.\"  Youngberg,  457  U.S.  at  317. \nThe  court  reasoned,  therefore,  that  minimally  adequate  treatment \nmust  be  considered in the  context of  \" ... that training which  is \nreasonable  in  light  of  identifiable  liberty  interests  and  the \ncircumstances  of  the case .... \"  and  stressed that  \"[b]ecause the \nfacts in cases of confinement vary widely,  it is essential to focus \non  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  the  case  before  a  court.\"  Id\". , \n31 \n\nat  320  n.  25  See  also Armstead  v.  Pingree,  629  F.  Supp.  273,  276 \n(M.D.  Fla.  1986)  (whether  treatment  falls  short- of  constitutional \nrequirements  is  a  factual  inquiry).  In  each  case,  therefore,  an \nindividual's  capacity  for  freedom  and  the  particular  trainingl \nneeded  to maintain  and  develop  the  skills  to  attain that  level  of \nfreedom  will  define  the  constitutional  minimum.  Clark  v.  Cohen, \n749  F.2d  79,  95  (3rd Cir.  1986);  S.H.  and  P.F.  v.  Edwards,  886  F.2d \n293  (11th  Cir.  1989)  (en  banc) \nIn this case,  one of the relevant circumstances in determining \nconstitutionally adequate habilitation would be the degree to which \ntraining  is  required,to  address  behaviors  resulting  from  lengthy \nand unnecessary institutional confinement.  Lengthy confinement of \na  mentally  retarded  person  in  a  psychiatric  hospital  has  many \nnegative  effects.  (See  Kimble  Affidavit  Ex.  B,  Par.  28-30)  For \nJ \nexample,  in  describing  circumstances  which  were  deemed \nunconsti tutional  for  a  class  of  mentally  retarded  plaintiffs, \ninstitutionalized in mental  hospitals,  the  Fourth  Circuit  found: \nThe  state  psychiatric  institutions  provide \nvery  abnormal  living  environments.  As  a \nresul t,  treatment  of  class  members  is \nseriously  compromised.  Within  the  state \npsychiatric  hospitals,  there  are  not  enough \nstructured  activities  to  keep  class  members \nIt  is  important  to  note  that  the  terms  \"training\"  and \n1 \nhabilitation\"  are  generally  used  in  reference  to  the  needs  of \npersons  with  mental  retardation  and  the  term  \"treatment\"  with \nreference  to  medical  treatment  of  the  mentally  ill.  \"The  word \n'habilitation',  ... is commonly used to refer to programs  for the \nmentally  retarded  because  mental  retardation  is.  .  a  learning \ndisability  and  training  impairment  rather  than  an  illness.  (T)he \nprincipal focus of habilitation is upon training and development of \nneeded  skills.\"  Youngberg,  457  U.S.  at 310  n.l,  quoting the amicus \nbrief  of  the American  Psychiatric Association. \n32 \n\nfrom  developing  inappropriate  behaviors  or \nlosing  independent  living  skills  in  the \nabnormal  institutional  environment.  They \nlearn  to  Iiv e  in  an  institution  and  their \nability  to  be  integrated  into  the  community \nand adapt to community life deteriorates  .  .  . \nWhen  confined  with  mentally  ill \npeople,  they  copy  the  social  behavior  of  the \nmentally  ill  patients.  This  is  called \nmodeling.  It further reduces  their chances  of \nliving in a  normal  setting. \nThomas  S.  v.  Flaherty,  699  F.  Supp.  1178,  1193  (W.D.N.C.  1988), \naff'd,  902  F.2d  250  (4th  Cir.  1990) \nThe  Thomas  S.  court  concluded  that  the  following  practices \nwith  regard  to  mentally  retarded  individuals  in  psychiatric \nhospitals  were  inconsistent  with  the  constitutional  minimum  for \nadequate  habilitation: \nMany  of  the  plaintiffs have  behavior  problems \nwhich  make  them  difficult  patients  to  treat. \nThis  difficulty  is  frequently  used  by  the \nstate to  justify inappropriate  placements. \nMany  of  the  plaintiffs  have  been  recommended \nfor  appropriate  placement  and  treatment  in \nless  restrictive residential  settings  (yet)  . \n.  plaintiffs  remain  confined  year  after \nyear  in  state psychiatric  institutions. \nAt  times  the people responsible for consenting \nto  or  approving  commitment  of  a  class  member \nto  a  state psychiatric  hospital  do  so  because \nthere  is  literally  no  other  place  for  the \nclass member  to go. \nFor  many  of  the  plaintiffs,  there  are  no \nestablished  alternatives  to  placement  in  a \nstate  psychiatric  hospital.  The  state  has \nchosen  not  to  make  appropriate  alternatives \navailable .... \nId.  at  1185. \nFollowing  Youngberg,  there  are  many  other  examples,  where \n33 \n\ncourts  have  described  standards  for  minimally  adequate  treatment \nfor institutionalized persons with mental disabilities.  It must be \nhabilit at ion  that  \"will  tend  to  render  unnecessary  the  use  of \nchemical restraint,  ... locked wards,  or prolonged isolation from \none's  normal  community\"  and  \"conditions  of  life which  are  normal \nenough  to promote  rather than detract from  one's  chances  of  living \nwith fewer  restrictions on  one's movement.\"  Cameron v.  Tomes,  783 \nF.  Supp.  1515  (D.  Mass.  1992)  aff'd as  modified,  990  F.2d  14  (1st \nCir.  1993);  Thomas  S.  v.  Flaherty,  699  F.  Supp.  at  1200-01; \n~ \nalso Jackson,  757  F.  Supp.  at 1312,  1313;  Mihalcik v.  Lensink,  732 \nF.  Supp.  299,  303  (D.  Conn.  1990) \nIn  Jackson  v.  Fort  Stanton  Hospital,  the  court  held  that,  in \norder  for  due  process  to  be  satisfied,  individual  patients  must \nhave  instruction  in  functional  skills,  carryover  training  from \nclassroom  to  living  units,  rehabilitation  services,  equipment \nadapted  to  the  needs  of  each  individual,  and  behavior  management \nprograms.  See  Jackson,  757  F.  Supp.  at  1308-13.  Similarly,  in \nThomas  S.  v.  Flaherty,  the  Fourth  Circuit  affirmed  a  district \ncourt's  order  requiring  habilitation in a  \"training setting which \napproximates  the  more  normal  environment  against  which  the \nincreasing  independence  of  patients  will  be  measured,\"  \"the \ndevelopment  of  individual  plans  for  moving  class  members  to  more \nnormal  settings,\"  and  \"the  provisions  of  alternative habilitation \nsettings  where  professional  recommendations  can  be  carried  out.\" \nThomas  S.  v.  Flaherty,  902  F.  2d  250,  253-54  (4th Cir.  1990),  cert \ndenied,  498  U.S.  951  (1990) \n34 \n\nMoreover,  it  is  well  established  that  due  process  requires \nthat  patients  be  protected  from  practices  that  contribute  to \ndeterioration  of  their  condition.  This  right,  suggested  by  the \nu.s. \nconcurring  opinion  in  Youngberg,  457  at  327  (Blackmun,  J., \nconcurring),  is  based  upon  the  understanding  that  \"[t]here  is  a \nsignificant  risk  that  unless  attention  is  paid  to  [residents'] \ndevelopmental and habilitation needs,  their skills will atrophy and \nthey will  regress.\"  Thomas  S.  v.  Flaherty,  699  F.  Supp  at 1194. \nPlaintiff  has  been  misplaced  in  mental  hospitals  for  many \nyears  and  for  extended  periods  of  time  where  her  needs  as  a \nmentally  retarded  adult  have  not  been  met.  Even  worse,  her \ncondi tion  has  regressed  and  her  skills  have  deteriorated.  Her \ncurrent  hosi talization  is  the  most  prolonged  and  thus  the  most \ndetrimental.  The'  cycle  results,  in part,  from  the  fact  that L.C. \nis confined to a  mental  hospital where,  instead of  learning how  to \nfunction more  she  learns how  to  live in a  psychiatric \neffecti~ely, \nhospital  and  acquires  institutional  behaviors  which  make  her  life \nin the community  increasingly difficult.  Furthermore,  her minimal \neducational and vocational needs are unmet.  (  See Kimble Affidavit, \nEx.  B,  Par.  31-37) \nUnder these facts and circumstances,  Defendants have failed to \nprovide minimally adequate treatment or habilitation to Plaintiff. \nAs  the  court  observed  in  Wyatt  more  than  twenty  years  ago,  \"To \ndeprive  any  citizen  of  his  or  her,  liberty  upon  the  altruistic \ntheory  that  the  confinement  is  for  humane  therapeutic  reasons  and \nthen  fail  to  provide  adequate  treatment  violates  the  very \n35 \n\nfundamentals  of due process.\"  Wyatt v.  Stickney,  325 F.  Supp.  782, \n785  (M.D.  Ala.  1971),  aff'd  sub  nom.  Wyatt  v.  Aderholt,  503  F.2d \n1315  (5th  Cir.  1974). \nPlaintiff  is  thus  entitled,  at a  minimum,  to  the development \nand  implementation  of  an  individualized  habilitation  and  mental \nhealth  treatment  plan  and  its  implementation  in  an  appropriate, \ncommunity  setting. \nb.  Minimallv Adeguate  Habilitation in the  Individual \nCircumstances  of  this  Case  Reguires  the  Development \nand  Implementation  of  Individualized Habilitation \nPlans  and  Community-Based  Placement. \nThe  formulation  of  individualized  treatment  plans  is  one  of \nthe  three  \"fundamental  conditions  of  adequate  and  effective \ntreatment\"  required  to  meet  the  constitutional  standards  for \nminimally  adequate  habilitation  in  this  Circuit.  Wyatt  v. \nAderholt,  503  F.2d  1305,  1316  (5th  Cir.  ,1974),  cited  in  S.H.  and \nP.F. ,886  F.2d  at  293.  To  the  extent  that  any  plan  has  been \ndeveloped  for  L.C.  in  the  mental  hospital,  it  has  not  been \ndeveloped by professionals qualified to develop the individualized \nhabilitation plan  that,  in  light of  L.C.'s  mental  retardation  and \nrelated problems,  is  needed  to meet  her needs. \nPlaintiff  is,  thus,  constitutionally entitled,  at a  minimum, \nto  a  comprehensive  individual  habilitation  plan  which  would \nidentify  her  problems  and  needs  developmental,  behavioral, \npsychiatric,  residential,  vocational,  educational,  and  personal  -\nand  how  to address  them.  The  plan would  identify the entities who \nare to provide the  services,  how  the  services  are to be  funded  and \nwhat  alternative  services  would  be  available,  if  necessary,  in \n36 \n\norder  to  prevent  psychiatric  re-hospitalization  for  any  purpose \nother  than  crisis  intervention.2 \nMinimally  adequate  habilitation  can  include  community \nplacement  in  an  individual  case.  The  Eleventh  Circuit  has \nrecognized  the  potentially  wide  scope  of  the  \"professional \njudgment\"  staridard  and  its  relationship  to  community  placement. \nWhile  the  court  in  S.H.  held  that  there  is  no  general  right  to \ncommunity  habilitation  in  the  least  restrictive  environment,  the \ncourt noted that its decision did not limit\" in any way\"  the relief \navailable to individuals who  prove that habilitation in a  community \nThese  are  typical  characteristics  of  individualized  plans. \n.  2 \nFor  example,  standards  regarding  the  content  of  these  plans  were \ndetermined  by  stipulation  in  the Wyatt  case  and  are  incorporated \nvirtually  verbatim  into  the  Georgia  Mental  Health  and  Mental \nRetardation  Codes.  They  require,  inter  alia,  that  the  plan  for \neach mentally retarded person contain a  statement of  the nature of \nthe  specific problems  and  specific needs  of  the patient,  the least \nrestrictive  treatment  conditions  to  achieve  the  purposes  of \ncommitment,  the  intermediate  and  long-range  treatment  goals,  with \na  projected  timetable  for  their  attainment,  a  statement  and \nrationale  for  the  plan of  treatment  to  achieve  these  intermediate \nand  long-range  goals,  a  specification of  staff  responsibility and \na  description  of  proposed  staff  involvement  with  the  patient  in \norder  to  attain these  treatment  goals  and  criteria for  release  to \nless  restrictive  treatment  conditions  and  criteria for discharge. \nWyatt  v.  Stickney,  344  F.  Supp.  at  384;  see  also O.C.G.A.  §  37-4-\n2(9);  O.C.G.A.  §  37-3-1(9). \n37 \n\nsetting  is  required  to  furnish  \"minimally  adequate  care\"  in \naccordance  with  professional  standards.  S.H.,  886  F.2d  at  293, \nciting  Wyatt  v.  Aderholt,  503  F.2d  1305  (5th  Cir.  1974).  Thus, \nunder  S.H.  and  other  cases  decided  after Youngberg,  each  resident \nof  a  state  mental  health  institution  must,  at  a  \"minimum\"  be \nafforded  treatment  appropriate  to  that  particular  individual's \nneeds  and  abilities,  even  where  that  treatment  includes  community \nliving. \nL.C.'s habilitation needs  require community placement.  There \nis complete  consensus  among  the professionals on  this point.  That \nthis  is  a  fundamental,  \"minimum\"  is  as  clear  in  her  case  as  it \ncould  be  in  any  case.  Perhaps,  in  1980,  when  the  pattern  of \npsychiatric  hospitalizations  began,  she  might  have  been  able  to \nlearn  to  live  with  minimal  assistance  in  a  personal  care  home  or \nfamily setting.  But she never had the habilitation programming and \nsupport  that  she  needed.  Instead,  she  was  re-hospi talized  so \nregularly and  for  such  extended  periods  of  time  that  she  acquired \ninstitutional,  maladaptive  behavior.  According  to  the  three \nevaluations  by  psychologists,  trained  to  test  and  to  identify \ndevelopmental  deficits  and  needs,  she  needs  to  be  viewed  from  a \ndevelopmental  perspective,  i.e.,  mental  retardation  program \nservices.  Specifically,  according  to  Dr.  Kimble: \nA  community-based  supervised  living \nenvironment is definitely indicated for L.C.'s \nprotection and basic well-being and to provide \nany  possibility  for  her  to  acquire  and \nmaintain  behaviors  required  for  basic \nactivities of daily living  (hygiene,  grooming, \netc. )  Any  return  to  psychiatric \nhospitalization  should  be  avoided  if  at  all \n38 \n\npossible  and,  if  required,  be  used  only \nbriefly for  crisis  intervention. \n(See  Exhibit  B,  Par.  35) \nFor  this  Plaintiff,  minimally  adequate  treatment  and \nhabilitation consistent with  her needs  can  only be  provided  in an \nappropriate  community: setting. \nc.  Youngberg  v.  Romeo  Requires  the Actual  Exercise  of \nQualified  Professional  Judgment. \nIn addition to the importance of the individual circumstances \nof  each  case  in  determining  minimally  adequate  treatment,  courts \nmust  show  deference  to  the  jud<jment  exercised  by  qualified \nprofessionals  to  avoid  interference by  the  federal  judiciary with \nthe  internal  operations  of  a  state  institution.  Youngberg,  457 \nu.S. \nat  324. \nHowever,  the  deference  due  the  decision  of  professionals  has \nlimits.  The decisionmaker must  be a  \"person competent,  whether by \neducation,  training,  or experience,  to make the particular decision \nat issue.  Long-term treatment decisions normally should be made by \npersons  with  degrees  in  medicine  or  nursing  or  with  appropriate \ntraining in areas such as psychology,  physical therapy,  or the care \nand  training  of  the  retarded.  rd.  at  323  n.  30.  (Emphasis  added). \nAnd  a  decision may be rejected by a  court when  it is a  \"substantial \ndeparture  from  accepted  professional  judgment,  practice,  or \nstandards. \"  Id •.  at  323.  A  decision  is  not  a  valid  exercise  of \nprofessional  judgment if it is based on expediency or a  decision to \nsave money  rather than on  the individual and  appropriate long-term \nhabilitation needs  of  the mentally  retarded  person. \n39 \n\nCourts  have  thus  rejected  decisions  by  clinicians  based  on \nconsiderations  which  were  not  clinically  based.  A  state  may  not \nallow  . \"bureaucratic  ineptitude  and  insufficient  allocation  of \nfunds\"  to obstruct professional  judgment.  Clark v.  Cohen,  794  F.2d \nat  86-87;  see  also  Thomas  S.  v.  Flaherty,  699  F.  Supp.  at  1196 \n(finding  that  treatment  recommendations  were  adapted  to  an \n\"inadequate service delivery system,  rather than  [informed by]  true \nprofessional  judgment\").  Similarly,  where a  professional  \"knew or \nshould  have  known  [about  a]  documented  problem,.  .  failing  to \nact appropriately should constitute the absence of  the exercise of \nprofessional  judgment.\"  Dolihite v.  Videon,  847  F.  Supp.  918,  936 \n(M.D.  Ala.  1994) \nAlthough the record is not absolutely clear at what point GRH \nA staff concurred that L.C.'s psychiatric goals had been met,  it is \nclear that at least one physician felt that way by early 1993.  The \nrecord  is  also  clear  that  the  staff  believed  that  L. C.  needed \nalternative placement.  These  judgments  are,  therefore,  consistent \nwith  Plaintiff's  contention  that  maintaining  her  at  GRH-A  was \ninappropriate.  Thus  the  professionals  who  have  at  least  the \nI \napparent qualifications to decide whether a  person's mental illness \nrequires  hospitalization,  the  treatment  staff at GRH-A,  concluded \nthat  L.C.  did  not  require  institutionalization  for  her  mental \nillness. \nL.C.'s  treating  professionals  at  GRH-A  are  not,  however, \nmental retardation professionals and are thus not qualified to make \nlong-term  decisions  about  L.C.'s  habilitation  for  her  mental \n40 \n\nretardation.  See  Youngberg,  457  U.S.  at  323  n.  30.  In  fact,  their \nlack  of  proficiency  in  this  case  confirms  the  wisdom  of  the \nYoungberg  court  in  protecting  the  constitutional  rights  of \nvulnerable  ind1viduals  whose  fates  depend  on  the  state's \nprofessionals  by  carefully  requiring  that  decisions  be  made  by \ngualified professionals in the area of the individual's disability. \nd.  Summary \nIn  sum,  L. C. ' s  constitutional  right  to  minimally  adequate \nhabili tation  has  been  violated  by  Defendants  to  a  significant \ndegree.  In  fact,  it is  difficult  to  conceive  of  a  more  obvious \ninconsistency with  the  straightforward  teaching  of  Youngberg  than \nthe  confinement  of  a  mentally  retarded  individual,  with  moderate \nretardation and  the capacity to function  in a  structured community \nsetting  for  an. extended  period  of  time,  to  a  large,  crowded \npsychiatric  ward  for  the  acute  care.of  severely  mentally  ill \nadults.  Donaldson,  422  U.S. ·at  575  (1973)  (stating  that  mental \nillness  \"alone cannot  justify a  State's locking a  person up against \nhis  will  and  keeping  him  indefinitely  in  simple  custodial \nconfinement.\") \nC.  PLAINTIFF  FACES  A  SUBSTANTIAL  THREAT  OF  IRREPARABLE \nHARM  OR  INJURY  IF  THE  TRO  AND  PRELIMINARY  INJUNCTION \nARE  NOT  GRANTED \nPlaintiff's right as a  disabled American under the ADA  as well \nas  her  established  constitutional  right  to  liberty and  to  be  free \nof  undue  restraint  are  at  stake  in  this  case.  Her  history  of \nrepeated psychiatric hospitalizations shows  that she is at risk if \nshe  remains  hospitalized.  She  is also at risk if she  is discharged \n41 \n\nsummarily  without  appropriate  services.  Her  discharge  without \nappropriate planning and  immediately after the  filing of  this· case \nalso  raises  the definite possibility that the  Defendants  will  now \nraise  mootness  as  a  defense  to  Plaintiff's  claim  for  adequate \nservices,  including  community  placement. \nThe risk Plaintiff faces if discharged without services is the \nseemingly  endless  cycle  of  crises  and.re-hospitalizations.  This \nis,  in  effe.ct,  a  pattern  of  indifference  to  L. C. ' s  obvious  and \npersistent  need  for  developmental  training  in  an  appropriate \nsetting.  She  is  a  victim,  it appears,  of  expediency.  \"To  the \nextent  that  a  professional's  judgment  ... [is]  modified  to  fit \nwhat  is  available,  that  judgment  likely has  become  a  substantial \ndeparture  from  professional  standards.\"  Thomas  S.  v. \nac~epted \nMorrow,  601  F.  Supp.  at  1055,  1060  (W.D.N.C.  1984),  aff'd  as \nmodified,  781  F.  2d  367  (4th  Cir.),  cert.  denied,  476  U.S.  1124, \nand  cert.  denied,  479  U.S.  869  (1986). \nIn a  recent case brought by disabled citizens challenging the \nelimination  of  city  recreational  programs,  the  court  found  that \nplaintiffs were  \"suffering irreparable injury in the absence of the \nkinds  of  programs  previously offered by  the  City,  which  cannot  be \nremedied by monetary damages.\"  Concerned  Parents,  846  F.  Supp.  at \n992.  Surely,  this  Plaintiff  is  suffering  and  will  suffer  an  even \ngreater  harm  if  she  is  released  before  appropriate  services  are \nidentified  and  provided  or  if  Defendants  continue  to  hold  her \nunnecessarily  in  a  locked  psychiatric  ward.  See,  for  example, \nDaniel B.  v.  White,  No.  Civ.  79-4088,  1991 WL  58494  at *3  (E.D.  PaD \n42 \n\n1991)  (District Court held that institutionalization of a  class of \nmentally  retarded  individuals  would  cause  them  irreparable  harm, \ngranted  a  preliminary  injunction,  and  ordered  state  to  provide \ncommunity-based  placements). \nL.C.'s living and  self-care skills have already deteriorated. \nThey  will  continue  to  do  so  and  will  eventually  reach  the  point \nwhere  the  only  alternative will  be  to  keep  her·  in  an  institution \nfor  the  rest  of  her  life.  If  this  Court  does  not  act,  Plaintiff \nwill  continue  to  suffer irreparable harm. \nD.  THE  THREATENED  INJURY  TO  PLAINTIFF  OUTWEIGHS  WHATEVER \nDAMAGE  THE  TRO  OR  PRELIMINARY  INJUNCTION  MAY  CAUSE  THE \nDEFENDANTS. \nA  TRO  or  preliminary  injunction  would'  cause  no  harm  to \nDefendants.  Plaintiff  only  seeks  what  Defendants  are  legally \nobligated to provide:  minimally adequate habilitation and  services \nin  the most  integrated appropriate  setting. \nA TRO  would  protect Plaintiff  from  possible  abandonment  to  a \nsituation  which  is  inadequate  to  meet  her  needs  after  years  of \ninappropriate  confinement. \nPlaintiff  seeks'  an  order  preventing  the  Defendants  from \ndischarging  her' from  their  legal  cust~dy  absent  appropriate \nplanning  and  provision  of  appropriate  services.  This  simply \nrequires  them  to maintain  her  on  \"trial visit\"  which  is  a  simple \nadministrative  stroke  of  a  pen. \nPlaintiff  also  seeks  the  actual  provision  of  appropriate \ncommunity  services  which  would  require  the  state  to  expend  less \nfunds  than  required  by  lengthy and  repeated  hospitalizations.  In \n43 \n\nany  case,  this  is  merely  requiring  Defendants  to  comply  with  the \nlaw.  Concerned Parents,  846  F.  Supp.  at 992.  (\"The expenditure of \nfunds  cannot  be  considered  a  harm  if the  law requires  it.\") \nE.  PUBLIC  INTEREST \nThe  State of  Georgia  has  an  interest  in  serving  its mentally \nretarded  citizens  with  appropriate  services  in  a  manner  which \ncomports with their constitutional rights.  The  state, in fact,  has \nrecently revised  its entire  statutory and  service delivery scheme \nin  order  to  better  coordinate  services  to  the  mentally  disabled. \n(See  Executive  Summary,  Report  of  the  State  Commission  on  Mental \nHealth,  Mental  Retardation,  and  Substance Abuse  Service  Delivery, \nExhibit  L).  It  is  thus  in  the  public  interest  to  assure  that \nPlaintiff receives  the services  she needs  and  that individuals are \nnot  unnecessarily  confined  in  expensive  institutions  when  they \nwould  be  better and  more  economically  served  in  the  community. \nAnd  even more  important is the public's  interest in providing \nfor  the  full  participation  of  persons  wi th  disabilities  in  the \ncommunity-based mental health and habilitation programs which meet \ntheir  needs.  Tugg  v.  Towey,  864  F.  Supp.  1201,  1210  (S.D.  Fla. \n1994). \nCONCLUSION \nBased  on  the  foregoing,  Plaintiff  respectfully requests  that \nher motion  be  granted. \n1-1r-0}-+-:-------, \n30~ \nThis  day  of  1995. \n44 \n\n\" \nRespectfully submitted, \nk~(!.~/?-\n/SUSAN  C.

AND E.W.,\neach by JONATHAN ZIMRING\nas guardian ad litem and next friend\n.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nA. Claims and Facts\nPetitioners have misstated several facts. First,\nRespondents did not claim as stated by Petitioners that the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\") \"required the\n\n2\nprovision of [community-based] . treatment.\" (Pet. at 3.)l\nRespondents claimed only that the provision of services by a\npublic entity in a segregated setting was discriminatory if the\ndisabled person qualified for an existing program in a more\nintegrated setting.\nSecond, although Petitioners repeatedly assert that the\nState lacked funding to place the Respondents in a community-\nbased setting, (Pet. at 3-4.) the record reveals other more\npernicious reasons why Respondents were not provided with\ndisability services in an appropriate, integrated setting.\nContrary to the Petitioners' misleading suggestion that L.C. and\nE.W. were provided with community placements \"as funding\nbecame available\" —asif that result would have followed as a\nmatter of routine had this litigation not been commenced —the\nundisputed facts show that, in L.C.'s case, her treatment staff\nwas discouraged from pursuing the very program where she was\nplaced after this case was filed. The Petitioners did not contend\nuntil this litigation that funds were unavailable to place L.C.\nSimilarly, Petitioners never contended that the State lacked the\nfunds to provide care for E.W. until after she joined this suit.\nB. Proceedings Below\nAs noted in the petition, the Court of Appeals2 based its\nopinion in this case in part on a regulation under the ADA\nReferences to the Petition will be cited as \"Pet. at_.\" References\nto the materials includedinPetitioners' appendix will be cited as \"Pet. App.\nat 7 Finally, references to the materials included in Respondents'\nAppendix attached hereto will be cited as \"Resp. App. at_.\"\n2 Thepanel consisted of Circuit Judges Tjoflat and Barkett and District\nJudge Propst (sitting by designation).\n\n3\npromulgated by the Department of Justice.3 L.C. v. Olmstead,\n138 F.3d 893, 896-97 (11th Cit. 1998). That regulation, which\nis referred to by the court as the integration regulation, requires\nthat \"[a] public entity shall administer services, programs, and\nactivities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs\nof qualified individuals with disabilities.\" 28 C.F.R.\nThe court concluded that \"[t]here can be little\n§ 35.130(d).\nquestion that the plain language of §35.130(d)prohibits a state\nfrom providing services to individuals with disabilities in an\nunnecessarily segregated setting.\" 138 F.3d at 897. In reaching\nits decision, the Court of Appeals found that the integration\nregulation was consistent with specific congressional findings4\nand the legislative history of the ADA. Id. at 898.\nFurthermore, the court concluded that the integration regulation\nwas consistent with the \"congressional mandate\" in §12134(b)\nthat regulations be \"consistent with this chapter and with the\ncoordination regulations under part 41 of title 28, Code of\nFederal Regulations . . . applicable to recipients of Federal\nfinancial assistance under [section 504 of the Rehabilitation\nAct].\" 138 F.3d at 896 (quoting 42 U.S.C. §\n12134(b)).\nCongress' decision to incorporate the § 504\ncoordination regulations is particularly significant\nhere. The Attorney General's § 504 coordination\nregulations mandate that recipients of federal\nThe Department of Justice took part as amicus curiae in the Eleventh\nCircuit.\nFor example, as the Court of Appeals noted, Congress found that\n\"discrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in a wide variety\nof areas of social life. including 'institutionalization,' 42 U.s.c.\n§ 12101 (a)(3) (1995), and that 'individuals with disabilities continually\nencounter various forms of discrimination, including outright intentional\nexclusion... [and] segregation. ...' 42U.S.C. § 12101(aXS).\" L.C., 138\nF.3d at 898.\n\n4\nfinancial assistance \"administer programs and\nactivities in the most integrated setting appropriate\nto the needc of qualified handicapped persons .\" 28\nC.F.R. § 41.51(d) (1997) (emphasis added). By\nrequiring the Attorney General to follow the §504\ncoordination regulations —includingthe explicit\nintegration requirement — Congress expressly\nmandated that individuals with disabilities receive\npublic services in the most integrated setting\nappropriate to their needs. Conforming to this\nmandate, §35.130(d)tracks this very language.\nId. at 897-98.\nAfter reviewing the specific facts concerning L.C. and\nE.W., the court determined that the confinement of L.C. and\nE.W. to a state mental hospital was discriminatory in violation\nof the integration regulation. Id. at 902. The court found that\nsummary judgment was properly granted since all the experts\nagreed that Respondents could be appropriately treated in less\nsegregated environments. Id. at 903. The court held that the\napplication of the integration regulation to these facts was\nappropriate and consistent with the Department of Justice's\ninterpretation of the regulation. Id. at 898.\nPetitioners repeatedly misstate the court's holding as a\nfinding that institutionalization constitutes \"discrimination per\nse\" (Pet. at 8, 10) and assert without basis that the decision\ngrants a \"per se right to community placement.\" (Pet. at 15.)\nThe Court of Appeals' decision does not suggest either result.\nRather, it ensures that L.C. and E.W. will not be unnecessarily\nsegregated if they are qualified for appropriate services in a\nmore integrated, existing program. L.C., 138 F.3d at 900 & n.6.\nAt the same time, the decision is clear that the ADA would not\nprevent their re-institutionalization if necessary. Id. at 903.\n\n5\nAdditionally, the remand ordered by the Court of Appeals\nprovides the State with the opportunity to show that\naccommodating these two individuals with integrated services\nwould require unreasonable expenditures. Id. at 905.\nARGUMENT\nI. Neither of the State's Claims Is Procedurally Postured\nfor This Court's Review.\nA. The Ruling of the Eleventh Circuit Is Not a Final\nDecision.\nThe Court of Appeals did not issue a final ruling in this\ncase. Instead, the Eleventh Circuit remanded this action to the\ndistrict court for additional findings on the State's principal\ndefense that additional funds would be required for L.C. and\nE.W.'s care in a less segregated setting and that the expenditure\nof those funds would cause a \"fundamental alteration\" in its\nprograms. L.C, 138 F.3d at 904-05. \"[B]ecause the Court of\nAppeals remanded the case, it is not yet ripe for review by this\nCourt.\" Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen & Enginemen v.\nBangor & AroostookR.R., 389 U.S. 327,328(1967). \"[E}xcept\nin extraordinary cases, the writ is not issued until final decree.\"\nHamilton-Brown Shoe Co. v. Wolf Bros. & Co., 240 U.S. 251,\n258 (1916). The writ should be denied \"unless it is necessary\nto prevent extraordinary inconvenience and embarrassment in\nthe conduct of the cause.\" American Constr. Co. v.\nJacksonville, T. & K W. Ry., 148 U.S. 372, 384 (1893). The\nState has suggested no reason whatsoever why this case should\nbe heard at this juncture despite the remand to the district court.\n\n6\nB. The State's Constitutional Arguments Were Not\nPresented and Decided Below.\nThe State of Georgia raised absolutely no argument in the\ndistrict court that Congress might lack enforcement power\nunder section five of the Fourteenth Amendment to forbid\ndiscriminatory institutionalization. Needless to say, the district\ncourt did not rule on any such issue. (Pet. App. 3 la-42a.) The\nState gave scant mention to any section five issue in its brief to\nthe Court of Appeals, mentioning it in only a single,\nabbreviated paragraph. (Resp. App. at A-2.) Like the district\ncourt, the Court of Appeals in its opinion made no mention of\nsection five. (Pet. App. la-30a.)\nThis Court should deny review of the section five issue.\nIn deciding a case in a virtually identical procedural posture,\nthis Court remarked: \"We do not address another issue\npresented by petitioners: whether application of the ADA to\n[respondents] is a constitutional exercise of Congress's power\nunder. .. § 5of the Fourteenth Amendment. Petitioners raise\nthis question [here], but it was addressed by neither the District\nCourt nor the Court of Appeals.\" Pennsylvania Dep 't of\nCorrections v. Yeskey, 118 S. Ct. 1952, 1956 (1998) (citations\nomitted).\nThis Court traditionally denies review of questions not\npresented and decided below. Where, as here, no issue is raised\nin the district court, review is denied unless error is \"obvious,\nor . . . seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public\nreputation ofjudicial proceedings.\" United States v. Atkinson,\n297 U.S. 157, 160 (1936). Here the State also failed to obtain\na section five ruling in the Court of Appeals. \"Ordinarily, this\nCourt does not decide questions not raised or resolved in the\nlower court.\" Youakim v. Miller, 425 U.S. 231, 234 (1976).\n\"These principles help to maintain the integrity of the process\n\n7\nofcertiorari.\" Taylor v. Freeland& Kronz, 503 U.S. 638, 646\n(1992). Once again, the State has offered no reason why this\nCourt should deviate from its usual denial of procedurally inapt\ncases.\nII. The Eleventh Circuit's Decision Is Correct and Does\nNot Raise an Important Issue Warranting Certiorari.\nA. The Decision Below Does Not Conflict with That of\nAny Other Federal Court of Appeals.\n1. The Two Courts of Appeals That Have Decided\nWhether Unnecessary Segregation Is\nDiscrimination Under the ADA Reached the Same\nConclusion.\nThere is absolutely no conflict in the circuits on this issue.\nThe Eleventh Circuit in this case and the Third Circuit in Helen\nL. v. DiDario, 46 F.3d 325 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 813\n(1995) agree that the ADA prohibits public entities from\nrequiring a disabled person to receive disability services in a\nsegregated program if the individual's needs can be met in an\nexisting, appropriate, more integrated program. In Helen L., the\nThird Circuit held that \"the ADA and its attendant regulations\nclearly define unnecessary segregation as a form of illegal\ndiscrimination against the disabled.\" Id. at 333. This\nconclusion was reached after a careful investigation of the\nADA's predecessor, §504of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,\nand a well-reasoned review of the ADA, its legislative history,\nits regulations, and agency interpretation of those regulations.\n\n8\nThe Eleventh Circuit in this case reached the same\nconclusion. Like the court in Helen L.,5 the Eleventh Circuit\nconcluded that the ADA and its legislative history, as well as its\nimplementing regulations and their agency interpretation,\n\"plainly prohibit a state from treating individuals with\ndisabilities in a segregated environment where a more\nintegrated setting would be appropriate.\" 138 F.3d at 897.\n2. Petitioners Cite to Irrelevant Cases Decided\nUnder the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 To Create a\nFalse \"Conflict\"\nPetitioners' argument that a conflict exists is based on a\ngroup of cases decided under a different statute, the\nRehabilitation Act of 1973. Among the cases asserted by\nPetitioners to conflict with the Eleventh Circuit's decision in\nthis case are one decided by the Eleventh Circuit, S.H. v.\nEdwards, 886 F.2d 292 (11th Cit 1989) (en banc), and one by\nthe Third Circuit, Clarkv. Cohen, 794 F.2d 79(3rd Cir. 1985).\nNotably, neither the Eleventh Circuit in this case nor the Third\nCircuit in Helen L were concerned that theft decisions created\na conflict with this circuit precedent. As stated by the Eleventh\nHoping to trigger alarm, Petitioners declare that \"Shepard's citations\nshowed '170 Citing References\" to Helen L., (Pet. at 8 n.4) implying that\nother courts are running amok with what they consider to be a misguided\ndecision. Examination of these cases, however, reveals that few made any\nreference to the central holding of the case. Instead, the vast majority were\nemployment discrimination cases (ADA, Title III) and had nothing to do\nwith the provisions of the ADA pertinent to this case (ADA, Title II).\nMoreover, the references to Helen L. were generally used to support basic\npropositions about the ADA (e.g.: the ADA was enacted to expand § 504;\nregulations promulgated by an agency are entitled to considerable weight,\netc.). Finally, many of the Shepard's citations were simply multiple\nreferences to the same case citing Helen L., which appeared in different\nreporters.\n\n9\nCircuit,\"nothing in 5.11 or these other cases remotely touches\non the issues presented by this appeal.. .. [N]oneof the cases\ncited by the State involved claims under the express integration\nregulation of either the ADA or the § 504 coordination\nregulations, and therefore, those cases are inapposite here.\"\nL.C., 138 F.3d at 901. Similarly, the Third Circuit, referring to\nits own Clark v. Cohen decision, stated that \"we were not there\nconcerned with the integration mandate of the ADA or the\nRehabilitation Act\" and noted that \"[t]he language of 28 C.F.R.\nis very different.\" Helen L., 46 F.3d at 333.\n§35.130(d)\nThe only two other Court of Appeals cases cited in\nPetitioners' string cite of supposedly conflicting decisions\nlikewise did not involve claims under the ADA, the integration\nregulation, or even the §504coordination regulations. See P.C.\nv. McLaughlin, 913 F.2d 1033 (2d Cir. 1990); Phillips v.\nThompson, 715 F.2d 365 (7th Cir. 1983). Petitioners'\npurported circuit conflict is illusory.'\nPetitioners' secondary argument, that Helen L has created\n\"confusion\" within the district courts, is likewise erroneous.\nEach of the five district court cases cited by Petitioners as\nillustrative of this supposed confusion is entirely consistent\nwith Helen L and the decision of the Eleventh Circuit. In three\nof the cases, the district courts found that the ADA prohibits a\n6 Indeed,only two of the cases cited by Petitioners to support their\nclaim of a purported \"conflict\" involved the ADA and its integration\nregulation. See Conner v. Branstad, 839 F. Supp. 1346 (S.D. Iowa 1993);\nWilliams v. Secretary of Exec. Office,609N.E.2d 447 (Mass. 1993). Soth\nare factually distinct and thus do not address the issue here. Conner\ninvolveda dispute regarding the qualification of the Plaintiffs for existing\nintegrated services and a claim that the state should create services, a claim\nnot made here. 839 F. Supp. at 1358. In Williams, the plaintiffs were not in\nsegregated programs. 609 N.E.2d at 45 1-52.\n\n10\nbased on\npublic entity from discriminating against an individual\nthe severity of her disability.7 In the two remaining cases, the\ncourts found that the ADA prohibits a public entity from\ndiscriminating against an individual by segregating her\nunnecessarily.8 Petitioners imply that these two forms of\ndiscrimination are inconsistent and cannot both be prohibited\nby the ADA. Certainly, none of the cited cases held, or even\nimplied, that such a limitation exists. As the EleventhCircuit\nnoted, the language and legislative history of the ADA show\nthat Congress was concerned with both fonns of discrimination.\n138 F.3d at 897-902.\nPetitioners concede that their experts found L.C. and E.W.\nis\nto be qualified for more integrated services. Each, in fact,\nreceiving integrated services after years of segregated,\nRespondents have been living\ninstitutional programs.\nsuccessfully in the community —L.C.since February 1996 and\nE.W. since July 1997. The State is merely seeking power to\nunnecessarily re-segregate them. No conflict in the circuits\nexists on the issue decided by the Court of Appeals in this case;\ntherefore, there is no justification for a grant of a writ.\nCable v. Department of Developmental Servs., 973 F. Supp. 937 (C.D.\nCal. 1997); Messier v. Southbury Training Sck, 916 F. Supp. 133 (D. Conn.\n1996); Williamsv. Wasserman, 937 F. Supp. 524 (D. Md. 1996).\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS\nKathleen S.v. Department of Pub. Welfare, 1998\n11819 (E.D. Pa. July 30, 1998); CharlesQ. v.Houstoun, 1997 U.S. fist.\nLEXIS 17305 (M.D. Pa. Sept. 30, 1997).\n\nII\nB. The Court of Appeals Simply Applied a\nCongressionally-Mandated Regulation to the\nUndisputed Facts.\nAs noted above, the Eleventh Circuit held that \"12131\nof the ADA and the Department of Justice's integration\nregulation, 28 C.F.R. § prohibit a state from\n35.130(d),\nconfining a disabled individual in a state-run institution where\nthat individual could be appropriately treated in a more\nintegrated community setting.\" LC., 138 F.3d at 895-96. l'his\ncase involved the application of that regulation to two disabled\npeople who, in the unanimous view of all the experts, no longer\nneeded to receive services in a segregated, state-run mental\ninstitution. Id. at 903. Petitioners assert, however, that \"formal\nadministrative interpretations\" of the ADA integration\nregulation are inconsistent with the interpretation given the\nregulation by the courts below and the Department of Justice.\n(Pet. at 11.) This assertion ignores the difference between the\ncoordination regulations (embraced by Congress in the ADA)\nand the §504regulations adopted by various federal agencies.\nThere were a variety of regulations promulgated under §504\nl,ecause each federal agency promulgated its own regulations.\nSome required integration of disabled persons with non-\ndisabled persons and some also required the integration of\ndisabled persons into the most integrated program appropriate\nto meet the individual needs of that person. The latter was a\nrequirement of the \"coordination regulations.\"9\nLikewise, the preamble to the ADA regulations, cited by\nPetitioners, does not support their contention that the regulation\nThe § 504 coordination regulations provide that \"[r]ecipients shall\nadministerprograms and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate\nto the needs of qualified handicapped persons.\" 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(d).\n(Kesp. App. at A-I.)\n\n12\nin this case requires only integration of the disabled\ninterpreted\nwith the non-disabled.'° Instead, the preamble addresses both\ndeals with the\naspects of the regulation. Paragraph 35.130(b)\nlimits on separate programs. Paragraph 35.130(d), by contrast,\nrequires that services be provided in the most appropriate,\nintegrated setting. Even the selected sections of the preamble\nchosen by Petitioners make this clear:\nTaken together, these provisions are intended to\nprohibit exclusion and segregation ofindividuals\nwith disabilities and the denial of equal opportunity\nenjoyed by others.\nIntegration is fundamental to the purposes of the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act.\nParagraphs (d) and (e).. . provide that the public\nentity must administer services, programs, and\nactivities in the most integrated setting appropriate to\nthe needs of qualified individuals with disabilities,\ni.e., in a setting that enables individuals with\ndisabilities to interact with non-disabled persons to\nthe fullest extent possible.\n(Pet. App. at 48a, 50a.) (second emphasis added).\nThus, the Court of Appeals correctly followed the plain\nlanguage of 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d). Moreover, the Court of\n°\nThe Court of Appeals, in addressing the State's argument that\n\"integration\" did not apply to services whichserveonlydisabled persons,\nnotedthat \"[r]educed to its essence, the State's argument is that Title II of\nthe ADA affords no protection to individuals with disabilities who receive\npublicservicesdesigned only for individuals with disabilities.\" L.C.,138\nF.3d at896.\n\n13\nAppeals had the benefit of the Department of Justice's own\ninterpretation of the regulation as expressed in the Preamble\nand in its amicus submissions to the court. \"It is well\nestablished 'that an agency's construction of its own regulations\nis entitled to substantial deference.\" Martin v. Occupational\nSafety & Health Review Comm 'n, 499 U.S. 144, 150 (1991)\n(citation omitted). This Court has adhered to this principle in\na recent case under Title III of the ADA. In concluding that a\nperson with HIV is covered by the Act, the Court relied on\nDepartment of Justice regulations, holding that \"[als the agency\ndirected by Congress to issue implementing regulations. .. the\nDepartment's views are entitled to deference.\" Bragdon v.\nAbbott, 1185. Ct 2196,2209 (1998))'\nIn short, Title H and its implementing regulations\ncompelled the result below, and there is no relevant conflict in\nthe circuits.\n\"\nPetitioners attempt to denigrate the Department of Justice's\ninterpretation expressed in an amicus brief to the Eleventh Circuit by\ncharacterizingitas a mere \"litigation position\" not entitled to deference.\nThis Court, however,hasheld otherwise. In Auer v.Robbing, 117S. Ct. 905\n(1997), this Court heldthatthe Department of Labor's interpretation of its\nregulations issued under the Fair Labor Standards Act was entitled to\ncustomary deference despite the fact that its position was first asserted in an\namicus brief because \"[t]here [wasi no reason to suspect that the\ninterpretation does not reflect the agency's fair and considered judgment on\nthe matter in question.\" 117 S. Ct. at 912. The Department of Justice is in\nexactly the same position in this litigation, and its interpretation is thus\nentitled to deference. Moreover, its position was not simply adopted in\nlitigation. The preamble to the integration regulation is equally definitive.\n\n14\nIII. Even If It Had Been Properly Asserted Below,\nPetitioners' Constitutional Claim Would Not Be\nCertworthy.\nA. In This Case, Any Opinion as to the ADA's\nValidity Under Section Five of the Fourteenth\nAmendment Would Merely Be Advisory.\nPetitioners contend that the ADA's proscription of\nunnecessary segregation of the mentally disabled exceeds\nCongress's authority under section five of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. In making this argument, Petitioners make the\nimplicit, but mistaken, assumption that if the ADA were\ndeclared to be an invalid exercise of Congress's section five\npower, the judgment rendered belowwould be reversible for\nthat reason. In passing the ADA, however, Congress not only\ninvoked its power to enforce the provisions of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, but also expressly relied on its power to regulate\ninterstate commerce. See 42 U.S.C. §12101(b)(4) (1995) (\"It\nis the purpose of this chapter . . . to invoke the sweep of\ncongressional authority, including the power to enforce the\nfourteenth amendment and to regulate commerce, in order to\naddress the major areas of discrimination faced day-to-day by\npeople with disabilities.\"). To hold that Congress exceeded its\nconstitutional authority in enacting the ADA, it would be\nnecessary for this Court to find that Congress exceededboth its\npower to enforce the provisions of theFourteenth Amendment\nand its power to regulate interstate commerce. Cf Heart of\nAtlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U.S. 241, 250-51\n(1964) (declining to consider whether Title II of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964 might also be a valid enactment under\nCongress's Fourteenth Amendment enforcement powers,\nbecause the Act was found to be a sustainable exercise of\nCongress's power to regulate interstate commerce). A decision\nas to the ADA's validity under section five would,\n\nis\nconsequently, merely be advisory and would have no impact\non the decision below.\nB. In Any Event, Every Court of Appeals To\nConsider the Issue Has Held That the ADA Does\nNot Exceed Congress's Power To Enforce the\nFourteenth Amendment.\nPetitioners' reliance on the Court's opinion in City of\nBoerne v. Flores, 117 S. Ct. 2157 (1997), to support their\ncontention that the ADA exceeds Congress's power to enforce\nthe Fourteenth Amendment is misplaced. Flores involved a\nchallenge to the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA),\na statute which purported to overrule the Court's decision in\nEmployment Division, Department of Human Resources v.\nSmith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990), by legislatively imposing a\nrequirement that any law burdening religion be justified by a\ncompelling government interest and be the least restrictive\nmeans of furthering that compelling governmental interest.\nSee Flores, 117S. Ct. at 2160-62. The Court found that those\nrequirements went beyond \"[t]he remedial and preventive\nnature of Congress' enforcement power,\" id. at 2166, by\n\"attempt[ing] a substantive change in constitutional\nprotections,\" id. at 2170. As stated by the Court:\nWhile the line between measures that remedy\nor prevent unconstitutional actions and measures\nthat make a substantive change in the governing\nlaw is not easy to discern, and Congress must have\nwide latitude in determining where it lies, the\ndistinction exists and must be observed. There\nmust be a congruence and proportionality between\nthe injury to be prevented or remedied and the\nmeans adopted to that end. Lacking such a\n\n16\nconnection, legislation may become substantive in\noperation and effect.\nId. at2l59.\nBoth before and after Flares, several of the Courts of\nAppeals have been faced with similar challenges to Congress's\nexercise of its enforcement power to enact the ADA, and each\nof them (including four courts after Flares was decided) has\nruled that the ADA does in fact represent a constitutional\nexercise of the enforcement power)2 See Alsbrook v. City of\nMaumelle, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 22112 (8th Cir. Sept. 11,\n12 Eachof these cases considered the question whether Congress had\nexceeded its powers under section five in the context of a challenge to the\nADA's abrogation of sovereign immunity. See Seminole Tribe v. Florida,\n517 U.s. 44, 60-73 (1996) (Congress may not abrogate a state's Eleventh\nAmendment immunity pursuant to its Article I power to regulate interstate\ncommerce, but only pursuant to its power to enforce the Fourteenth\nAmendment). No Eleventh Amendment concern stands in opposition to\ncongressional powers here, however. Petitioners have not claimed —and\ncould not claim —EleventhAmendment immunity in this case. The only\ndefendants in this lawsuit are state officials, and the only relief sought is\ndeclaratory and injunctive. This case thus falls within the doctrine of Ex\nPorte Young. See Green v. Mansour, 474 U.S. 64, 68 (1985) (\"Eleventh\nAmendment does not prevent federal courts from granting prospective\ninjunctive relief to prevent a continuing violation of federal law.\"); see, e.g..\nArmstrong v. Wilson, 124 F.3d 1019, 1025-26(9th Cir. 1997) (holding that\n\"the exception to Eleventh Amendment immunity set forth in Kr porte\nYoung,. .. squarelyapplies to allow this action [brought under the ADA and\nthe Rehabilitation Act of 1973,29 U.S.C. § 794] against named individuals\nin their official capacity\"). Respondents, therefore, could have proceeded\nwith this suit against Petitioners consistent with the Eleventh Amendment.\neven if the ADA was validly enacted only with respect to Congress's power\nto regulate interstate commerce.\n\n17\n1998);!3 Kimel v. Florida Bd of Regents, 139 F.3d 1426, 1433\n(11th Cir. 1998); Coolbaugh v. Louisiana, 136 F.3d 430,433-\n38 (5th Cir.) cert. denied, 67 U.S.L.W. 3230 (Oct. 5, 1998)\n(No. 97-1941); Clarkv. Cal jfornia Dep't of Corrections, 123\nF.3d 1267, 1270-71 (9th Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct.\n2340 (1998); see also Crawford v. Indiana Dep '1 of\nCorrections, 115 F.3d 481,487(7th Cir. 1997) (pre-Flores).\nPetitioners' suggestion that the ADA exceeds Congress's\nenforcement power because the disabled are not a suspect class\nhas been consistently rejected by those decisions. See, e.g.,\nClark, 123 F.3d at 1270-71 (\"We reject California's argument\nthat Congress's power must be limited to the protection of\nthose classes found by the Court to deserve 'special protection'\nunder the Constitution.\"). In the very case that decided that the\nmentally retarded were not a suspect class, City of Cleburne v.\nCleburne Living Ct'. Inc., 473 U.S. 432 (1985), this Court\ndemonstrated that the mentally retarded (like all non-suspect\nclasses) still possess substantial rights under the Equal\nProtection Clause, In that case, the Court declared invalid\nunder the Equal Protection Clause a requirement that a special-\nuse permit be obtained for a group home for the mentally\nretarded because the requirement \"rest[edj on an irrational\nprejudice against the mentally retarded,\" id. at 450, and was,\nthus, not \"rationally related to a legitimate governmental\npurpose,\" id. at 446. Classifications on the basis of disability\nare thus a valid subject for congressional legislation pursuant\n13 Priorto its decision in Alsbrookv. City ofMaumelle, the Eighth\nCircuit had come to the same conclusion in Autlo v. AFSCME. Local 3139,\n140 F.3d 802(8th Cit. 1998). The panel's opinion, however, was vacated\nby the court's order granting rehearing en banc. Subsequently, by an equally\ndivided vote, the en banc court affinned without opinion the district court's\njudgment (the result also reached by the prior panel). 1998 U.S. App.\nLEXIS 24907 (8th Cit. Oct. 5, 1998).\n\nIs\nto Congress's powers under the enforcement clause, just as\nclassifications on the basis of race and gender can be. As\nstated by Judge Posner on behalf of the Seventh Circuit:\nAlthough the state argues that the ADA is outside\nthe scope of section 5, that argument is ref ted by\nour earlier discussion of Congress's concern that\ndisabled persons are victims of discrimination.\nInvidious discrimination by governmental\nagencies, such as Indiana's prison system, violates\nthe equal protection clause even if the\ndiscrimination is not racial, though racial\ndiscrimination was the original focus of the clause.\nCrawford, 115 F.3dat487.\nAlso misplaced is Petitioners' attempt to analogize the\nADA to RFRA, by suggesting that the ADA has impermissibly\nenacted a more stringent standard of review applicable to equal\nprotection claims by the disabled than that established by this\nCourt in Cleburne. In support of this contention, the Petition\ncites the ADA section enumerating Congress's factual\nfindings, which concludes in pertinent part that the disabled\n\"are a discrete and insular minority\" who have been subjected\nto a history of intentional discrimination. 42 U.S.C.\n(a)(7) (1994). While Petitioners are correct that this\n§ 12101\nlanguage \"echoes\" footnote 4 of United States v. Carolene\nProducts Co., 304 U.S. 144 (1938), Petitioners point to\nabsolutely no indication in the statute itself or in its legislative\nhistory that, simply by maldng this legislative finding,\nCongress intended to overrule the Court's opinion in Cleburne.\nNor do Petitioners suggest that the Eleventh Circuit in its\nopinion below considered the ADA to create a new standard of\njudicial review for constitutional challenges to agency action.\nIndeed, as noted by the Third Circuit, \"the limited case law is\n\n19\nto the contrary,\" Con tractors Ass 'n v. City of Philadelphia, 6\nF.3d 990, 1001 (3d Cir. 1993) (citing More v. Farrier, 984\nF.2d 269,271 n.4 (8th Cir. 1993)), and in the eight years since\nthe ADA was enacted, both this Court and the Courts of\nAppeals have consistently continued to cite Cleburne for the\nproposition that the mentally retarded and other disabled\npersons are not a suspect class. See, e.g., Heller v. Doe, 509\nU.s. 312, 321 (1993);\" Kimel, 139 F.3d at 1441 (Hatchett,\nCi., concurring); id. at 1449 (Cox, .1., dissenting);\nCoolbaugh, 136 F.3d at 433-34 & n.1 (citing five post-ADA\nCourt of Appeals cases in accord with Cleburne that the\ndisabled are not a suspect class).\nWhile Congress's legislative fmding that the disabled\nhave suffered a history of intentional discrimination may well\nbe persuasive to this Court if it were ever to reconsider its\ndecision in Cleburne, Congress did not itself purport to\nperform that reconsideration for the Court as it did in the\ncontext of RFRA. As the Fifth Circuit recently stated:\nIn the ADA, Congress included no language\nattempting to upset the balance of powers and\nusurp the Court's function of establishing a\nstandard of review by establishing a standard\ndifferent from the one previously established by the\nSupreme Court. Congress performed one of its\ntraditional legislative functions by fmding facts\nrelating to proposed legislation. The Supreme\nCourt may in the future, if it chooses to do so,\nThe Petitioner in He/kr i'.Doe arguedthat the Court should overnile\nits prior decision in Cleburne, based in part on the passage of the ADA. See\nHeller, 509 U.S. at 335 n. I (Souter, J., dissenting) (describing the\nPetitioner's argument). However, the Court refused to consider the argument\nbecause it was not properly below. 509 U.S. at 319.\npresented\n\n20\nreconsiderthe Cleburne standard of review in light\nof the Congressional fmdings. However, this\nconflict is not a sufficient reason for us to\ninvalidate the ADA.\nCoolbaugh, 136 F.3d at 438.\nFinally, Petitioners' argument that it is beyond\nCongress's power to authorize a judicial finding that\nunnecessary institutionalization is discriminatory on the facts\nof a particular case, has no merit. As noted above, all of the\nCourts of Appeals to decide the issue have agreed that, in\ncrafting the ADA, Congress did not cross the line from\nremedying and preventing constitutional violations to declaring\nthe substance of constitutional rights. Those courts have\ninstead concluded that the ADA demonstrates the \"congruence\nand proportionality between the injury to be prevented or\nremedied and the means adopted to that end,\" as specified by\nthis Court in Flores. 117 S. Ct. at 2164; see, e.g., Coolbaugh,\n136 F.3d at 437 (ADA \"is not so draconian or overly sweeping\nto be considered disproportionate to the serious threat of\ndiscrimination Congress perceived\"); Clark, 123 F.3d at 1270\n(neither ADA nor Rehabilitation Act \"provides remedies so\nsweeping that they exceed the harms that they are designed to\nredress\").\nThe ADA's legislative record, backed by detailed\nCongressional findings regarding the history of discrimination\nand segregation faced by the disabled, see 42 U.S.C.\namply support the conclusion that, at the time of\n§ 12101(a),\nthe ADA's passage, there remained \"a significant likelihood of\nunconstitutional actions and therefore a significant 'evil' to be\naddressed.\" Coolbaugh, 136 F.3d at 437 (describing the \"wide\nrange of evidence,\" including \"seven substantive studies or\nreports\" and a \"wealth of testimonial and anecdotal evidence\n\n21\nfroma spectrum of parties to support the finding of serious and\npervasive discrimination\"); Alsbrook, 1998 U.s. App. LEXIS\n22112, at *\n10 (noting Congress's \"detailed and specific\nfindings regarding the nature and extent of persistent\ndiscrimination suffered by individuals with disabilities\").\nIndeed, as discussed by the Eleventh Circuit, those legislative\nfindings included findings with respect to the very\ndiscrimination practiced by the State in this case:\nIn enacting the ADA, Congress determined that\ndiscrimination against individuals with disabilities\npersists in a wide variety of areas of social life,\nincluding \"institutionalization,\" 42 U.S.C.\n§ 12101(a)(3) (1995), and that \"individuals with\ndisabilities continually encounter various forms of\ndiscrimination, including outright intentional\nexclusion. .. [and]segregation. . . .\" 42U.S.C.\n§ 12101(a)(5).\nL.C, 138 F.3d at 898. The court also noted Congress's finding\nthat: \"Historically, society has tended to isolate and segregate\nindividuals with disabilities, and . . . such forms of\ndiscrimination against individuals with disabilities continue to\nbe a serious and pervasive social problem.\" Id. (quoting 42\nU.S.C. § 12101(a)(2)). In this important respect, the\nlegislative record of the ADA differs from that of RFRA,\nwhich as Flores emphasized, \"lack[ed] examples of modem\ninstances of generally applicable laws passed because of\nreligious bigotry.\" 117 5. Ct. at 2169; see Coolbaugli, 136\nF.3d at 438 (emphasizing the distinction); Alsbrook, 1998 U.S.\nApp. LEXIS 22122, at *1041.\nThe specific holding of the courts in this case —that the\nADA precludes a state from \"confin[ing] an individual with a\ndisability in an institutionalized setting when a community\n\n22\nis appropriate,\" as determined by the \"disabled\nplacement\nindividual's treating professionals,\" L.C., 138 F.3d at 897, 902\n— also demonstrates a congruence and proportionality\nbetween the injury to be prevented and the means adopted to\nthat end. Contrary to the State's insistence that the courts\ncreated a \"per se\" right to treatment in a community setting,\nthe Eleventh Circuit explicitly limited its holding to cases\nwhere a mentally disabled person is \"unnecessarily\nsegregated,\" Id. at 899, that is, where \"all the experts agree\nthat, at a given time, the patient could be treated in a more\nintegrated setting,\" Id. at 903. In addition, the court noted a\nfurther limitation inherent in the ADA that the State \"need not\nprovide these services if to do so would require a fundamental\nalteration in its programs,\" and the court remanded to the\ndistrict court for further consideration of this issue. Id. at 904.\nFar from \"disturb[ing] the delicate balance between the\nnational government and the State governments,\" (Pet. at 15-\n16), as asserted in the Petition, the ADA, as applied by the\nEleventh Circuit in this case, presents a measured response to\nan intractable example of unnecessary segregation, which\nexpressly takes into account the State's concerns in\nmaintaining the fundamental integrity of its programs.\nCONCLUSION\nThe Petition for a Writ of Certiorari should be denied.\n\n23\nRespectfully submitted,\nDAVID A.
