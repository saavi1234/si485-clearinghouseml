The plaintiffs, represented by legal services, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the State was unlawfully and unnecessarily segregating people with disabilities in nursing homes rather than serving them in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs--their own homes.  Specifically, the plaintiffs requested the admission to the waiver program, the creation of waiting lists for MiChoice, and the provision of information to the public about the MiChoice program.</p><p>After long and detailed settlement negotiations, on February 2, 2004, the parties reached a settlement whereby for FY '04, the state was required to allocate no less than $100 million to the MiChoice program, the state agreed to take steps to ensure greater public understanding of long term care options, and the state would use identical criteria for both applicants for the MiChoice program and applicants to nursing facilities, etc.</p>",

Introduction \n2  1.  This is a complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief brought by elderly and \n3  younger persons with disabilities and by organizations whose mission is to advocate for community \n4  placement for people with disabilities to challenge the Defendants' failure to provide needed, \n5  community-based long term care services in violation of the Medical Assistance Act (\"Medicaid\") \n6  42 U.S.C. §1396 et seq.; the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.; \n7  and Section 504 ofthe Rehabilitation Act of 1973,29 U.S.C. § 794 (\"Section 504\").  The plaintiffs \n8  individually named are each eligible for, desire, have applied for or have attempted to apply for and \n9  have been denied community-based Medicaid-funded services, specifically services available \n10  pursuant to the Home and Community Based Waiver Program (hereinafter \"the Waiver program\"), \n11  42 U.S.C. § 1396n.  Plaintiffs have been unable to gain access to these critical services because, as of \n12  October 1, 2001, Defendants Engler and Haveman have unlawfully restricted funding to the Waiver \n13  program, thus resulting in the closure of the program to virtually all new applicants.  Because of \n14  Defendant Engler's and Haveman's actions, the individually named plaintiffs and those in similar \n15  situations on behalf of whom the organizational Plaintiffs advocate will remain unnecessarily \n16  institutionalized or remain  at imminent risk of unnecessary institutionalization. \n17  2.  The Medicaid program traditionally funded long term care services only in \n18  institutional settings.  However, Congress recognized the strong desire of most people with \n19  disabilities, like the individual Plaintiffs, to remain in their own homes or to return to their own \n20  homes. It therefore authorized states to obtain waivers to provide Medicaid-funded long term care \n21  services in the community as an alternative to nursing home placement. 42 U.S.C. § 1396n. \n22  Michigan, like every other state, thereafter sought and obtained a waiver to provide home and \n23  community-based care and began providing services in 1992.  Effective October 1, 1999, Michigan \n24  made a commitment to provide these waiver services to 15,000 individuals each year and did so until \n25  September 30, 2001. \n26  3.  As of October 1, 2001, the beginning ofthe current fiscal year, however, Defendants \n27  chose to reduce funding for the waiver program by $20 million and have thus ensured that the \n28  2 \n\nCase 5:02-cv-00044-DWM  Doc #1  Filed 03/19/02  Page 3 of 23   Page ID#3\n1  individual Plaintiffs, like virtually all individuals who are not already receiving waiver services, will \n2  be unable to do so during the current fiscal year. The individual Plaintiffs have therefore been forced \n3  to seek long term care services in nursing homes or to remain in the community without these \n4  essential services and remain at risk of institutionalization.  Defendants have therefore unnecessarily \n5  segregated and isolated the individual Plaintiffs in nursing homes or put the individual Plaintiffs at \n6  risk of unnecessary institutionalization, in violation ofthe ADA, Section 504, and the Medicaid Act. \n7  Similarly, Defendants have also unlawfully and unnecessarily segregated and isolated many of the \n8  individuals on whose behalf the organizational Plaintiffs advocate or put these individuals at risk of \n9  unlawful and unnecessary institutionalization. \n10  II.  Jurisdiction and Venue \n11  4.  This court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C.§§ 1331 and \n12  1343(a)(3)-(4). \n13  5.  This action is authorized pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 794a, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202, and \n14  by 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 12133. \n15  6.  Venue is appropriate in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1391(b) because Plaintiffs \n16  Eager, Hugger, Wright, Michigan Association of Centers for Independent Living, Michigan \n17  Disabilities Rights Coalition, and Grand Rapids Center for Independent Living reside in this District, \n18  Defendants have their official place of business in this District, and because a substantial part of the \n19  events or omissions giving rise to the claims set forth in this complaint occurred in this District. \n20  III.  Parties \n21  A.  Individual Plaintiffs \n22  7.  Plaintiff Robert Eager is a 44-year-old Traverse City resident who has been diagnosed \n23  with Multiple Sclerosis which causes him to have a disability as defined in the ADA at 42 U.S.C. \n24  §12102(2)(A) and a disability as used in Section 504. \n25  8.  Plaintiff Dora Oats is a 77-year-old resident of Ypsilanti  who suffered a devastating \n26  stroke in August, 2001 which causes her to have a disability as defined in the ADA at 42 U.S.C. \n27  §12102(2)(A) and a disability as used in Section 504.  Due to her disability, Ms. Oats brings this \n28  3 \n\nCase 5:02-cv-00044-DWM  Doc #1  Filed 03/19/02  Page 4 of 23   Page ID#4\n1  action through Crystal Oats, her granddaughter and next friend. \n2  9.  Plaintiff Howard Hugger is a 10 0-year-old resident of Lansing who suffers from \n3  leukemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cognitive impairments, and other conditions that \n4  cause him to have a disability as defined in the ADA at 42 U.S.C. §12102(2)(A) and a disability as \n5  used in Section 504.  Due to his disabilities, Mr. Hugger brings this action through his niece and \n6  guardian, Sharon Cook. \n7  10.  Plaintiff Terrell King, age 29,  is paralyzed from the neck down as the result of a \n8  football injury which causes him to have a disability as defined in the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §12102(2)(A) \n9  and a disability as used in Section 504. \n10  11.  Plaintiff Georgette Kraft is an 81-year-old resident of the Rivergate Convalescent \n11  Center in Riverview, Michigan.  Ms. Kraft has Alzheimer's disease and arthritis, which causes her to \n12  have a disability, as defined in the ADA at 42 U.S.C.  §12102(2)(A) and a disability  as used in \n13  Section 504.  Due to her disabilities, Ms. Kraft brings this action through her husband and next \n14  friend, Roy Kraft. \n15  12.  Plaintiff Dennis Lowe, age 42, has a cognitive impairment and seizure disorder as a \n16  result of a traumatic brain injury and thus has a disability as defined in the ADA at 42 U .S.C. \n17  § 121 02(2)(A) and a disability as used in Section 504.  Due to his disability, Mr. Lowe brings this \n18  action through his guardian, John Munger. \n19  13.  Plaintiff Evelyn G. Wright, age 82, is a resident oflrons, Michigan, who has organic \n20  brain syndrome and severe arthritis which causes her to have a disability as defined in the ADA at 42 \n21  U.S.C. §12102(2)(A) and a disability  as used in Section 504.  Due to her disabilities, Ms. Wright \n22  brings this action through her son and next friend, Paul Mayzes. \n23  B.  Organizational Plaintiffs \n24  14.  Plaintiff Michigan Disability Rights Coalition (MDRC) is a non-profit, state-wide \n25  network of individuals and organizations that advances the interests of Michigan's disability \n26  community through community capacity building, grassroot activism, public education and \n27  advocacy.  The Michigan Disability Rights Coalition has several thousand members and partners \n28  4 \n\nCase 5:02-cv-00044-DWM  Doc #1  Filed 03/19/02  Page 5 of 23   Page ID#5\n1  with other organizations as part of its coalition.  As a result of the Defendants' omissions or actions, \n2  as more full described herein,  MDRC is forced to expend time and organizational resources \n3  advocating for additional community placements for individuals with significant disabilities. \n4  15.  Plaintiff Michigan Association of Centers for Independent Living (MACIL) is a \n5  nonprofit corporation whose members are Centers for Independent Living (CILs). See 29 U.S.C. § \n6  796f.  Its purpose it to promote the independent living philosophy and to advocate for the individual \n7  and collective program, service and financial needs of CILs throughout Michigan.  As a result of \n8  Defendants' omissions or actions, as more fully described herein, MACIL is forced to expend time \n9  and organizational resources advocating for additional community placements for individuals with \n10   significant disabilities \n11  16.  PlaintiffMichigan Campaign for Quality Care is an unincorporated, grassroots \n12  organization of consumers who seek better care and better choices for Michigan's nursing home \n13  residents.  As a result ofthe acts or omissions of Defendants as more fully described herein, many \n14  Campaign members are unable to leave of substandard nursing homes and return to the community \n15  or move their family members in substandard nursing homes back to the community where the \n16  residents would prefer to live.  The Michigan Campaign for Quality Care and its members continue \n17  to suffer injury as a result ofthe Defendants' actions due to the needs of the organization and its \n18  members to spend time and resources advocating for community alternatives for themselves and \n19  their family members. \n20  17.  Plaintiff Great Lakes Center for Independent Living (GLCIL), as a center for \n21  independent living, is a nonprofit corporation funded through the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § \n22  796f, to serve and represent people with disabilities in the Detroit area.  GLCIL assists clients in \n23  achieving community integration and avoiding unnecessary institutionalization. Many of its clients \n24  face continued and unwanted institutionalization or are at risk of unnecessary institutionalization \n25  because of the acts or omissions of Defendants, as more fully described herein. \n26  18.  Plaintiff Grand Rapids Center for Independent Living (GRCIL ), as a center for \n27  independent living, is a nonprofit corporation funded through the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \n28  5 \n\nCase 5:02-cv-00044-DWM  Doc #1  Filed 03/19/02  Page 6 of 23   Page ID#6\n1  §796f, to serve and represent people with disabilities in the Grand Rapids area.  GRCIL assists \n2  clients in achieving community integration and avoiding unnecessary institutionalization.  Many of \n3  its clients face continued and unwanted institutionalization or are risk of unnecessary \n4  institutionalization because of the acts or omissions of Defendants, as more fully described herein. \n5  19.  As a result of the defendants' actions, the Great Lakes Center for Independent Living \n6  and the Grand Rapids Center for Independent Living have been forced to spend time and resources \n7  to advocate for community based services, rather than assisting persons with disabilities with other \n8  issues, including obtaining accessible and affordable housing, equal employment opportunities, and \n9  access to places of accommodation.  These injuries will continue in the future so long as defendants' \n10  actions and practices are unchanged. \n11  C.  Defendants \n12  20.  Defendant John Engler is Governor ofMichigan and, pursuant to Const 1963, art 5, \n13  § 1,  all executive power of the State of Michigan rests with him.  Defendant Engler also has the \n14  responsibility, pursuant to Const. 1963, art. 5, § 18, to prepare and submit a budget to the Michigan \n15  Legislature. \n16  21.  Defendant James K. Haveman, Jr. is the Director of the Michigan Department of \n17  Community Health (hereinafter \"MDCH\"), appointed by the Governor of Michigan.  As such, \n18  pursuant to MCL 330.1104, all executive authority ofthe MDCH rests with him. MDCH is the \n19  single state agency responsible for administering the Michigan Medicaid Program, including the \n20  Home and Community Based Services Waiver Program.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(5). \n21  IV.  Factual Allegations \n22  A.  Plaintiffs' need for community-based services \n23  22.  Plaintiff Robert Eager was diagnosed in 1991 with multiple sclerosis while employed \n24  as a supervisor in a steel fabrication plant.  One year later, as his disability worsened,  Mr. Eager was \n25  no longer able to perform his duties and was forced to leave work.  Mr. Eager has continued to \n26  experience a progressive loss of function in his hands and legs and now uses a wheelchair  and is \n27  challenged and exhausted by virtually every activity of daily living. \n28 \n6 \n\nCase 5:02-cv-00044-DWM  Doc #1  Filed 03/19/02  Page 7 of 23   Page ID#7\n1  23.  Mr. Eager has two sons, Donald, 11, and Justin, 15, as well as, 18-year-old stepson, \n2  Brent Diehl, whom he raised.  Mr. Eager is divorced and, although his children live with their \n3  mother, they visit Mr. Eager regularly and sometimes spend the night with him.  Mr. Eager values \n4  tremendously the time he and his children spend together at his home.  If Mr. Eager is forced to seek \n5  nursing home placement, both the quantity of time his children will spend with him and the quality \n6  of their relationship will be severely diminished. \n7  24.  Currently, Mr. Eager receives no services and manages to survive in the community \n8  only because of the extraordinary efforts and kindness of friends, but he is uncertain whether the \n9  friends who assist him will be able to continue to do so in the future. \n10  25.  There is no dispute that Mr. Eager has been determined financially and medically \n11  eligible for the Home and Community Based Waiver program.  As recently as January 18, 2002, at a \n12  hearing in front of an administrative law judge of the MDCH, representatives of the Area Agency on \n13  Aging ofNorthwest Michigan, the waiver agent designated to provide services in Mr. Eager's region \n14  of the state, acknowledged that the only reason they were not able to provide services to Mr. Eager \n15  was because Defendants reduced available funding for the waiver program. \n16  26.  Because of his disabilities and his financial status, Mr. Eager is eligible to enter a \n17  nursing home today and have his care paid for by Medicaid at far greater cost to the State than the \n18  cost of maintaining him in the waiver program.  Although Mr. Eager is a generally a genial, \n19  optimistic and determined man, because he so values his independence and his family life, he has \n20  repeatedly stated that he would refuse food and water if he were forced to enter a nursing home. \n21  27.  Plaintiff Dora Oats was completely independent prior to her devastating stroke in \n22  August, 2001.  She is now paralyzed on her right side; needs supervision or assistance with many \n23  activities of daily living such as bathing, toileting, and transferring herself from her bed to her \n24  wheelchair; is unable to perform routine chores such as cooking, cleaning, shopping, and money \n25  management; suffers from confusion and disorientation; requires round-the-clock supervision; is at \n26  risk of falling; and needs assistance managing her household. \n27  28.  Ms. Oats' granddaughter, Crystal Oats, provides round-the-clock care to her at Ms. \n28 \n7 \n\nCase 5:02-cv-00044-DWM  Doc #1  Filed 03/19/02  Page 8 of 23   Page ID#8\n1  Oats' home and was forced to leave her job in October to take care of Ms. Oats. Other family \n2  members provide some additional assistance when they are able. Ms. Oats receives only four hours \n3  per week of homemaker services from the Area Agency on Aging.  Because Crystal Oats has three \n4  children, and because both she and Plaintiff have very limited resources, she will soon have to return \n5  to work to support her family.  In the absence of services pursuant to the Home and Community \n6  Based Waiver Program,  Ms. Oats will then require nursing home placement. \n7  29.  Crystal Oats and her family are unaware of a local nursing home that would accept \n8  Plaintiff and provide high quality care to her.  They also believe that Plaintiff would become more \n9  disoriented and deteriorate iftaken out of her familiar surroundings.  Moreover, Plaintiff Dora Oates \n10  has repeatedly expressed her pride in her home of more than 40 years and her strong desire to remain \n11  there.  Therefore, Plaintiff and her family are anxious to ensure Ms. Oats does not need to be \n12  institutionalized. \n13  30.  PlaintiffDora Oats applied for the waiver program in September 2001, was found \n14  eligible for waiver services after a telephone screen,  but was denied services because no waiver slots \n15  were available. Crystal Oats appealed the decision on behalf of her grandmother and a hearing was \n16  held on November 29, 2001.  However, in December, Administrative Law Judge Gregory J. Kershul \n17  denied the appeal, concluding that administrative law judges had no authority to allot more funds to \n18  a region or contractor than the state determines it will provide and cannot order the provision of \n19  services if there are insufficient funds to pay for them. \n20  31.  Plaintiff Howard Hugger is a 10 0-year-old man who suffers from some cognitive \n21  declines, leukemia, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,  and a thyroid condition.  Until \n22  July, 2001, Mr. Hugger lived alone in his home and received services under the Home and \n23  Community Based Waiver program.  After a fall in his home and treatment in several local health \n24  care facilities, he was no longer able to live independently and moved in with his niece, Sharon \n25  Cook.  Ms. Cook is a 61-year-old woman who suffers from fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, \n26  arthritis and back problems and who has herself been receiving Social Security Disability payments \n27  since 1996. \n28  8 \n\nCase 5:02-cv-00044-DWM  Doc #1  Filed 03/19/02  Page 9 of 23   Page ID#9\n1  32.  In September, 2001, Mr. Hugger suffered two more falls and became disoriented. \n2  After a brief hospital stay, he was placed in the Eaton County Medical Facility, a local nursing \n3  home.  Pursuant to a petition filed in Probate Court by Cass County Protective Services, an agency \n4  named Guardianship Alternatives was appointed as Mr. Hugger's conservator and Ms. Cook was \n5  appointed to serve as his guardian. \n6  33.  During the more than three months in which Mr. Hugger lived in the nursing home, \n7  Ms. Cook alleges he  lost approximately one pound per week, did not receive appropriate care for \n8  several medical conditions, became sluggish and depressed, and asked constantly when he could \n9  return to Ms. Cook's home. \n10  34.  Because Mr. Hugger's condition and spirits were deteriorating in the nursing home, \n11  Ms. Cook agreed to bring Mr. Hugger home again on Christmas Day, 2001 and he has remained in \n12  her home since that time.  His spirits and energy have markedly improved and he has repeatedly \n13  expressed his desire to remain in his niece's home.  However, because of her own disabilities, Ms. \n14  Cook has been overwhelmed by Mr. Hugger's needs including constant assistance with toileting, \n15  feeding, and ambulation; 24 hour supervision; sleep interruptions as often as a dozen times a night; \n16  the responsibility for  arranging for Mr. Hugger's continuing health care and benefits; and the \n17  responsibility for sorting through the contents of Mr. Hugger's former apartment. \n18  35.  Until February 20, 2002, Medicare paid for an aide to bathe Mr. Hugger, but that \n19  service was discontinued on February 21, 2002,  Mr. Hugger's lOOth birthday.  On or about \n20  February 22, 2002, counsel for Mr. Hugger was informed by Marion Owen, Acting Director for the \n21  Tri-County Office on Aging, that there were approximately 100 people on the waiting list ahead of \n22  Mr. Hugger for assistance with basic needs like bathing.  Subsequently, after Mr. Hugger was \n23  hospitalized with pneumonia, Sparrow Hospital arranged temporarily for additional services, \n24  including assistance with bathing, but could not guarantee how long those services would continue \n25  to be provided. Because Ms. Cook is unable to lift Mr. Hugger and bathe him, Ms. Cook might be \n26  forced to place Mr. Hugger in a nursing home for his last days when his temporary services are \n27  discontinued. \n28 \n9 \n\nCase 5:02-cv-00044-DWM  Doc #1  Filed 03/19/02  Page 10 of 23   Page ID#10\n1  36.  Plaintiff Terrell King is a 29-year-old resident of Madonna Nursing Home in Detroit \n2  whose spinal cord was severed as a result of a football injury in 1992.  Mr. King entered the nursing \n3  home seven years ago to spare his mother the burden of caring for him. \n4  37.  Mr. King is essentially paralyzed from the neck down, although he has limited range \n5  of motion in his arms.  Mr. King uses a power wheelchair for ambulation. \n6  38.  A lifelong resident ofthe City of Detroit, Mr. King regularly leaves the nursing home \n7  to visit with family and friends and to attend social activities in the community.  Mr. King \n8  desperately seeks to move out of the nursing home so that he can enjoy a more normal and integrated \n9  lifestyle, spend more time with people his own age, and pursue an education. \n10  39.  Mr. King has contacted the Defendants' waiver agent more than once and as recently \n11  as February 4, 2002. On that date, he encountered a telephone recording which asked him to leave a \n12  message.  He did so and asked that he be contacted concerning the availability of a slot in the waiver \n13  program.  To date, Mr. King has not heard back from Defendants' waiver agent. \n14  40.  Mr. King's caseworker at the Great Lakes Center for Independent Living believes he \n15  can find an appropriate apartment for Mr. King in Detroit and that Mr. King would be able to live \n16  independently ifhe had waiver services to help him with basic care, food preparation, and other \n17  activities of daily living.  Without the services of the Home and Community Based Waiver Program, \n18  however, Mr. King will be forced to remain in the nursing home, surrounded by many individuals \n19  who are decades older than he is and who do not share his interests or participate in similar activities. \n20  41.  Plaintiff Georgette Kraft is an 81-year-old woman who resides in a nursing home in \n21  Riverview, Michigan and has lived there for more than two years.  Ms. Kraft lives in a nursing home \n22  so that she may receive long-term care services she needs to survive.  Ms. Kraft could live in her \n23  apartment with her husband, where she could be provided with long-term care services through the \n24  Home and Community Based Waiver Program. \n25  42.  Ms. Kraft and her husband, Roy Kraft, have had a long and happy marriage.  It is \n26  their mutual hope that they will be able to spend their remaining days together in their apartment. \n27  43.  Mr. Kraft comes to the nursing home to provide services to his wife on an almost \n28  10 \n\nCase 5:02-cv-00044-DWM  Doc #1  Filed 03/19/02  Page 11 of 23   Page ID#11\n1  daily basis.  He provides for her what the nursing home cannot or will not provide.  He provides her \n2  the type of personal attention and loving care that only a family member can provide. \n3  44.  Georgette Kraft's son, David Kraft, contacted a local waiver provider in an attempt to \n4  obtain services for his mother but was informed there were no waiver slots available.  Absent those \n5  waiver services, Mr. Kraft is unable to care for his wife in their apartment.  With the provision of \n6  those services, Mrs. Kraft can return to her home and live with her husband. \n7  45.  Plaintiff Dennis Lowe is a 42-year-old resident of Rochester Hills, Michigan who \n8  resides in an assisted living facility.  Mr. Lowe has a cognitive impairment and a seizure disorder \n9  that are the result of a traumatic brain injury.  He lives in his own apartment which he has furnished \n10   and which he pays for out of his disability income. \n11  46.  Due to his disability, Mr. Lowe requires assistance with certain activities of daily \n12  living, including showering, shaving and, occasionally, dressing.  Mr. Lowe also requires assistance \n13  with meal reminders and with the dispensing of medications. \n14  47.  Each of those services that Mr. Lowe requires can and would be paid for by the Home \n15  and Community Based Waiver.  However, the waiver agent that was contacted by Mr. Lowe's sister, \n16  Etta Dahlen, of Royal Oak, Michigan, informed her that no waiver slots were available and thus Mr. \n17  Lowe cannot be admitted to the Waiver Program.  Absent these services through the Home and \n18  Community Based Waiver Program, Mr. Lowe will be forced to enter a nursing home. \n19  48.  Plaintiff Evelyn G. Wright is an 82-year-old resident oflrons, Michigan, a rural \n20  community.  Ms. Wright has Organic Brain Syndrome and severe arthritis. \n21  49.  Because of her cognitive impairments, Ms. Wright has significant difficulty in \n22  managing her medication and requires assistance to help her with this task.  She also requires \n23  assistance with the activities of daily living and with cleaning and maintaining her household. \n24  50.  Ms. Wright is a proud and independent woman.  She has a true horror of \n25  institutionalization because of the trauma she suffered when she was institutionalized as a young girl \n26  in a home for children. Entering a nursing home now would greatly diminish the quality of her life, \n27  separate her from friends and family, and rob her of her independence. \n28  11 \n\nCase 5:02-cv-00044-DWM  Doc #1  Filed 03/19/02  Page 12 of 23   Page ID#12\n1  51.  Ms. Wright has been evaluated by the Defendants' local waiver agent, the Area \n2  Agency on Aging of West Michigan.  She was found to be eligible for services under the Home and \n3  Community Based Waiver Program.  However, the waiver agent was unable to provide those \n4  services, due to the actions of Defendants in reducing funding to the program. \n5  52.  Absent waiver services, Ms. Wright will continue to rely upon the assistance ofher \n6  son, who himself has a disability, and her daughter-in-law, Barbara Mayzes.  However, her son and \n7  daughter-in-law do not have the resources to provide the complete array of services that Ms. Wright \n8  requires to ensure a high quality of life and to ensure her safety while at home. \n9  B.  The Importance of Community Integration \n10  53.  People forced to accept long term care in an institutional setting experience separation \n11  from family, friends, and familiar surroundings and a significant loss of privacy.  They may also \n12  experience difficulty adjusting to new environments, depression, loneliness, boredom, and physical \n13  and mental deterioration. \n14  54.  In 1990, when enacting the ADA, Congress expressly recognized that \"historically, \n15  society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, and despite some \n16  improvements, such forms of discrimination against individuals with disabilities continue to be a \n17  serious and pervasive social problem.\"  42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(2). \n18  55.  The Supreme Court has expressly recognized that \"unjustified institutional isolation \n19  of persons with disabilities is a form of discrimination\" in violation of the ADA.  Olmstead v. L. C. , \n20  ex. Rel. Zimring, 119 S.Ct. 2176,2187 (1999). \n21  56.  On January 10, 2001, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, in a letter \n22  to State Medicaid directors, identified the Home and Community Based Waiver Program as a \n23  primary vehicle for states to satisfy their obligations pursuant to the Olmstead decision. \n24  57.  On June 18, 2001, President George W.  Bush issued an Executive Order asserting \n25  that the United States is committed to community-based alternatives for individuals with disabilities, \n26  that unjustified isolation or segregation of qualified individuals with disabilities through \n27  institutionalization is a form of disability-based discrimination prohibited by Title II of the \n28 \n12 \n\nCase 5:02-cv-00044-DWM  Doc #1  Filed 03/19/02  Page 13 of 23   Page ID#13\n1  Americans with Disabilities Act, and that the federal government must assist States to implement \n2  swiftly the Olmstead decision \"so as to help ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to live \n3  close to their families and friends, to live more independently,\" ... and to participate in community \n4  life.\" Exec. Order No. 13217,66 Fed Reg. 33155 (June 18, 2001). \n5  58.  The Michigan legislature long ago recognized the importance ofthe Home and \n6  Community Based Waiver Program by codifying a requirement in 1988 that the State make the \n7  program available to individuals who would otherwise require institutional care.  See MCL \n8  400.109c. \n9  59.  Unlike the vast majority of states, Michigan has not adopted a plan to comply with \n10  the  Olmstead decision and has engaged in only minimal implementation of initiatives that would \n11  hasten community integration or reduce unnecessary institutionalization.  In fact, in addition to \n12  reducing funding for the waiver program for the current fiscal year, as more fully set forth below, \n13  paragraphs 85-88, infra, as of December 12,2001, the Michigan Department of Community Health \n14  has instructed waiver providers that they may no longer seek additional waiver funding to assist \n15  residents transitioning out of nursing homes into community settings.  See Appendix 1, \n16  Memorandum from Kathie Black, Michigan Department of Community Health to MI Choice Waiver \n17  Executive Directors, MI Choice Waiver Program Managers, Elizabeth O'Hara and Ellen Weaver, \n18  Michigan Association of Centers for Independent Living. \n19  60.  Up until this point, the waiver program has been the State's primary vehicle for \n20  furthering community integration. The effective closure of the program to new applicants including \n21  eligible  individuals who seek to return to the community from nursing homes means that the state is \n22  moving backwards, not forwards, in pursuing  community integration and that individuals with \n23  disabilities, like the individual plaintiffs and the individuals who are represented by or members of \n24  the organizational plaintiff groups, face continued discrimination and despair. \n25  C.  The Medicaid Home and Community Based Waiver Program \n26  1.  Overview \n27  61.  The Medicaid program is a joint federal-state program in which states may choose to \n28  13 \n\nCase 5:02-cv-00044-DWM  Doc #1  Filed 03/19/02  Page 14 of 23   Page ID#14\n1  participate and is designed to provide medical care to indigent populations.  42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq. \n2  62.  Michigan, like all states, has chosen to participate in Medicaid. \n3  63.  The federal government provides the majority of funding for state Medicaid \n4  programs. \n5  64.  All states must designate a single state agency to administer the Medicaid program. \n6  MDCH is the agency so designated by the state of Michigan. MCL 400.105. \n7  65.  States must provide a certain array of services to designated indigent populations \n8  pursuant to federal law, 42 U.S.C. § 1396(a)(l0), but may also serve additional populations and/or \n9  provide optional coverage for additional medical services. \n10  66.  Mandatory services include, inter alia, nursing facility services for eligible \n11  individuals requiring long term care. 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(l O)(A). \n12  67.  Pursuant to 42 U.S.C.§1396n, however, states may seek a waiver from the federal \n13  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to pay for long term care services to eligible \n14  individuals in the community. This program is commonly known as the Home and Community \n15  Based Waiver program. \n16  2.  Administration of the Michigan Waiver Program \n17  68.  In 1992, the Michigan Medicaid Program received approval from the federal \n18  government to implement in 11 counties a Home and Community Based Waiver program for elderly \n19  and disabled individuals who were determined to be financially  eligible for Medicaid and medically \n20  eligible for long term care services. \n21  69.  Services available under the waiver program include homemaker services, adult day \n22  care, transportation, personal care, personal emergency response systems, counseling, environmental \n23  modifications, respite services, chore services, private duty nursing, medical supplies and equipment \n24  not covered by the State Medicaid plan, and training in a variety of independent living skills. See 42 \n25  C.F.R. 440.180; MCL 400.109c. \n26  70.  Waiver services are provided by designated regional waiver agents including area \n27  agencies on aging and other nonprofit organizations.  These organizations enter into contracts with \n28  14 \n\nCase 5:02-cv-00044-DWM  Doc #1  Filed 03/19/02  Page 15 of 23   Page ID#15\n1  MDCH that set forth how the waiver program is to be administered and how the waiver agent will be \n2  reimbursed. \n3  71.  These designated waiver agents accept applications for the waiver program and \n4  screen applicants to determine their medical eligibility and appropriateness for waiver services.  For \n5  individuals found eligible for waiver services, the waiver agents develop a plan of care and oversee \n6  the delivery of services. \n7  72.  The MDCH has committed in its waiver application to the federal government, see \n8  paragraphs 74-78 infra,  that it will be not limit the cost of services that can be provided to an \n9  individual waiver client.  However, in FY 2001, the average per diem cost was less $42 per waiver \n10  client. \n11  73.  Until October 1, 2001, each waiver agent was allotted a specific number ofthe 15,000 \n12  waiver slots statewide. The allocation of these slots was based on a fiscal year starting on October 1 \n13  and ending on September 30. \n14  3.  Michigan's Federal Waiver Application \n15  74.  In 1995, MDCH submitted, and the federal government approved, a five-year waiver \n16  plan. \n17  75.  On March 2, 2000, the MDCH received approval from CMS to expand its waiver to \n18  serve 15,000 people statewide retroactive to October 1, 1999. \n19  76.  The terms ofthe waiver program approved by the federal government are set forth in \n20  the state's waiver application and in subsequent amendments contained in correspondence between \n21  the state and the federal government concerning the program. \n22  78.  The 1995 waiver application granted by the federal government expired in 2000. \n23  MDCH submitted a renewal application to continue the waiver program for a period of five years for \n24  15,000 unduplicated individuals per year.  Subsequently, the State sought, and CMS has approved, \n25  multiple 90 day extensions of the terms of the 1995 waiver to permit continued services to 15,000 \n26  eligible individuals during the fiscal year. \n27 \n28 \n15 \n\nCase 5:02-cv-00044-DWM  Doc #1  Filed 03/19/02  Page 16 of 23   Page ID#16\n1  4.  The Demand for Waiver Services \n2  79.  Despite the requirements of federal law, the MDCH has in place no procedure for \n3  advising individuals eligible for Medicaid-funded long term care services of the availability of \n4  services under the waiver program. \n5  80.  Despite this lack of a procedure to ensure that individuals entering nursing homes are \n6  advised of their right to seek community based services under the waiver, waiver agents generally \n7  filled all oftheir allocated slots long before September 30. \n8  81.  Because waiver agents were specifically directed by MDCH not to maintain waiting \n9  lists, the full extent of the unmet community need for waiver services is not known nor is there any \n10   mechanism to determine how long people who seek waiver services wait before they receive them. \n11  Upon information and belief, however, hundreds of people with disabilities seeking waiver services \n12  to avoid institutionalization were formally or informally denied those services in previous fiscal \n13  years once all slots were filled. \n14  82.  Despite being instructed not to maintain waiting lists, upon information and belief, \n15  numerous waiver providers have recently  begun to maintain lists of individuals who are seeking \n16  admission to the waiver program and who they determine in telephone screens to be eligible for \n17  waiver services.  For example, since September 1, 2001, even though many referral sources know \n18  that the program is essentially closed and have therefore stopped making referrals, the Area Agency \n19  on Aging in Lansing has identified and  had to turn away in excess of 450 people who are seeking \n20  access to waiver services and who appear eligible for those services.  See Appendix 2, Affidavit of \n21  Marion Owen, Executive Director, Tri-County Office on Aging. \n22  5.  Funding for the Waiver Program and Reduction in Number of Clients \nApproved for the Waiver Program effective October 1, 2001. \n23 \n83.  In authorizing the budget for the MDCH, the Michigan Legislature allocated in \n24 \nexcess of $1.2 billion for the provision of nursing home and personal care services and enabled the \n25 \nDepartment to tap these funds to support the waiver program \"in lieu of nursing home services for \n26 \nindividuals seeking long term care services.\" 2001 P A 60, § 1681. \n27 \n28 \n16 \n\nCase 5:02-cv-00044-DWM  Doc #1  Filed 03/19/02  Page 17 of 23   Page ID#17\n1  84.  In FY 2001, upon information and belief, the Department expended $146 million on \n2  the waiver program.  These funds were distributed to waiver agents based on the number of waiver \n3  clients they served and the costs waiver agents incurred in providing services to those clients. \n4  85.  In a letter to the Michigan House of Representatives dated July 23, 2001 regarding \n5  FY 2002 appropriations to the Department of Community Mental Health (\"MDCH\"), Governor \n6  Engler stated that he had \"instructed the Department [of Community Health] to reduce the number of \n7  participants in the [waiver} program ..... \" See Appendix 3. \n8  86.  In September, 2001, the Department announced it intended to reduce spending on the \n9  program to $126 million and may in fact, expend even less than that in this fiscal year. \n10  87.  Along with the reduction in funding, MDCH announced a new funding formula \n11  which eliminated the Department's prior practice of allocating a designated number of \"slots\" to \n12  each waiver provider.  Instead, waiver agents were offered a fixed amount and were instructed to use \n13  these funds to support FY 2001 waiver clients who would continue to receive services in the new \n14  fiscal year (\"carry-over clients\") and any new clients the waiver providers chose to admit to the \n15  program.'  However, upon information and belief, the funding offered to waiver providers \n16  constituted a 20 to 30 percent decrease from the funding they received in FY 2001.  Affidavit of \n17   Marion Owen, Appendix 2. \n18 \n19  Upon information and belief, the Department determined the amount of funding \n20  allocated to each waiver agent this fiscal year by determining the number ofwaiver  clients being \n21  served by each provider on a \"snapshot date\" in September, 2001 and  multiplying that number by \n22  270 (the number of days the Department determined  represented the average length of \n23  stay in the waiver program) and by the average amount  of money per day that waiver agents were \n24  previously entitled to receive for providing  services to waiver clients. Waiver agents were subsequently \n25  informed that they will be  eligible for a contract amendment to obtain slightly more funding for \n26  individuals who  remain in the program more than 270 days, but this additional  funding  is \n27  insufficient to  enable waiver agents to admit new applicants into the program. \n28 \n17 \n\nCase 5:02-cv-00044-DWM  Doc #1  Filed 03/19/02  Page 18 of 23   Page ID#18\n1  88.  Most waiver providers have found the fixed payments to be insufficient to provide \n2  services to current clients who are legally entitled to continue receiving services as long as they \n3  remain medically and financially eligible for the program.  As a result of the reduction in funding, \n4  waiver agents have been forced to close the waiver program to all but a handful of all new \n5  applicants, thus reducing the number of participants in the program in accordance with Defendant \n6  Engler's specific directive.  Affidavit of Marion Owen, Appendix 2. \n7  V.  Claims \n8  Count I -- Title XIX of the Social Security Act: Failure to Implement the State Medicaid Plan \n9  89.  Plaintiffs restate and reallege paragraphs 1-88. \n10  90.  Individual clients are each eligible for and have applied for Medicaid funded Home \n11  and Community Based Waiver Services. \n12  91.  Title XIX provides that the State must identify the number of unduplicated \n13  beneficiaries to which it intends to provide Home and Community Based Waiver Services in each \n14  year.  42 C.F.R. § 441.303(£)(6).  This number is both a ceiling and a floor on the number of persons \n15  to be served. \n16  92.  In Michigan's Home and Community Based Waiver proposal, which was approved \n17  by CMS and under which MDCH continues to operate, MDCH committed to provide waiver \n18  services to 15,000 persons each fiscal year since October 1, 1999. \n19  93.  Title XIX of the Social Security Act provides that Home and Community Based \n20  Waiver Services approved by CMS are included as \"medical assistance\" under the state Medicaid \n21  plan.  42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(1).  Thus, waiver services approved for this state are part of the \"medical \n22  assistance\" described in Michigan's state plan. \n23  94.  Title XIX also provided that the state plan must provide for making \"medical \n24  assistance\" available to eligible individuals, including persons eligible for waiver services.  See 42 \n25  U.S.C. § 1396a(10)(A)(ii)(VI). \n26  95.  However, instead of making the waiver program available to 15,000 persons each \n27  year as set forth in the waiver application approved by CMS, the MDCH is administering and \n28  18 \n\nCase 5:02-cv-00044-DWM  Doc #1  Filed 03/19/02  Page 19 of 23   Page ID#19\n1  funding the waiver program in such a manner that, upon information and belief, fewer than 11,000 \n2  people will actually be served in the waiver program during this fiscal year.  Affidavit of Marion \n3  Owen, Appendix 2. \n4  96.  MDCH has failed to  implement the waiver and, therefore, has failed to provide \n5  medical assistance under the State Medicaid plan in violation of Title XIX. \n6  Count II -- Title XIX of the Social Security Act: Failure to Furnish Medical Assistance with \nReasonable Promptness \n7 \n97.  Plaintiffs restate and reallege paragraphs 1-96. \n8 \n98.  Title XIX requires that the State plan provide \"[medical] assistance shall be furnished \n9 \nwith reasonable promptness to all eligible individuals.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8).  This means, inter \n10 \nalia, that MDCH must furnish medical assistance promptly without any delay caused by the \n11 \nagency's administrative procedures. 42 C.P.R. § 435.930(a). \n12 \n99.  The services authorized by the home and community based waiver are \"medical \n13 \nassistance\" services and MDCH has failed to furnish such services to Plaintiffs with reasonable \n14 \npromptness in violation of Title XIX. \n15 \nCount III -- Title XIX of the Social Security Act: Failure to Allow Applications \n16 \n100.  Plaintiffs restate and reallege paragraphs 1-99. \n17 \n10 1.  Title XIX requires that the state plan shall \"provide that all individuals wishing to \n18 \nmake application for medical assistance under the plan shall have the opportunity to do so .... \"  42 \n19 \nU.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8); 42 C.F.R. § 435.906. \n20 \n102.  The services authorized by the home and community based waiver are \"medical \n21 \nassistance\" services and MDCH has failed to provide the opportunity for some of the individual \n22 \nPlaintiffs to apply for those services or to complete the application process, in violation of Title XIX. \n23 \nCount IV-- Title XIX of the Social Security Act: Violation of Waiver Assurances \n24 \n103.  Plaintiffs restate and reallege Paragraphs 1-102. \n25 \n104.  Title XIX requires that a state must provide assurances that, inter alia, individuals \n26 \nwho may be eligible for home and community based services under the waiver program will be \n27 \n28 \n19 \n\nCase 5:02-cv-00044-DWM  Doc #1  Filed 03/19/02  Page 20 of 23   Page ID#20\n1  advised of the availability of these services as an alternative to nursing home placement.  42 U.S.C. \n2  §1396n(c)(2); 42 CFR §§ 441.302(c)-(d). \n3  105.  Defendants have violated Title XIX by failing to inform individuals eligible for \n4  services under the waiver program of the availability of those services. \n5  Count V --Violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act: Unnecessary Segregation \n6  106.  Plaintiffs restate and reallege Paragraphs 1 through 105. \n7  10 7.  The individual Plaintiffs are qualified individuals with disabilities because they have \n8  physical and, in some cases, mental impairments that substantially limit one or more major life \n9  activities and are qualified to receive long term care services funded by MDCH.  42 U.S.C. § \n10  12102(2) and 12131(2); 29 U.S.C. §705(20)(B). \n11  108.  The individual Plaintiffs are protected by the Americans with Disabilities Act \n12  (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. 12132. \n13  109.  MDCH is a public entity subject to the ADA. 42 U.S.C. 12131(1). \n14  110.  The individual Plaintiffs can, with appropriate supports and services, live in \n15  community-based programs.  For these individuals, segregation and institutionalization in nursing \n16  homes is unjustified and unnecessary. \n17  111.  Defendants violate Title II of the ADA by failing to provide services to Plaintiffs in \n18  the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs.  42 U.S.C. 12132; 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b). \n19  112.  Providing services to the individual Plaintiffs in the most integrated setting \n20  appropriate to their needs rather than in a segregated institution would not result in a fundamental \n21  alteration of the programs provided by MDCH. \n22  113.  Defendants have developed no plan to ensure that the individual Plaintiffs are \n23  provided with services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs. \n24  Count VI-- Violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act:  Discriminatory Methods of \nAdministration \n25 \n114.  Plaintiffs restate and reallege Paragraphs 1 through 113. \n26 \n115.  Defendants have administered long term care services funded by Title XIX in such a \n27 \n28 \n20 \n\nCase 5:02-cv-00044-DWM  Doc #1  Filed 03/19/02  Page 21 of 23   Page ID#21\n1  manner as to force the individual Plaintiffs to be unnecessarily segregated or at risk of unnecessary \n2  segregation. \n3  116.  Defendants are therefore violating Title II ofthe ADA by using methods of \n4  administration that have the effect of subjecting individual Plaintiffs to discrimination on the basis of \n5  disability.  42 U.S.C.§ 12132; 28 C.P.R. §35.130(b)(3). \n6  Count VII --Violation of the Rehabilitation Act: Unnecessary Segregation \n7  117.  Plaintiffs restate and reallege Paragraphs 1 through 116. \n8  118.  The individual Plaintiffs are qualified individuals with disabilities because they have \n9  physical and, in some cases, mental impairments that substantially limit one or more major life \n10  activities and are qualified to receive long term care services funded by MDCH.  29 U.S.C. \n11  §705(20)(B). \n12  119.  The individual Plaintiffs are protected by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 \n13  U.S.C. §794(a). \n14  120.  MDCH receives federal financial assistance through, inter alia, the Medicaid \n15  Program and, is therefore subject to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. §§794(a) and \n16  794(b)(1)(A). \n17  121.  The individual Plaintiffs can, with appropriate supports and services, live in \n18  community-based programs.  For these individuals, segregation and institutionalization in nursing \n19  homes is unjustified and unnecessary. \n20  122.  Defendants violate Section 504 by failing to provide services to the individual \n21  Plaintiffs in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs.  29 U.S.C. §794(a); 28 C.P.R. § \n22  41.51(d); 45 C.P.R. §84.4(b)(2). \n23  123.  Providing services to the individual Plaintiffs in the most integrated setting \n24  appropriate to their needs rather than in a segregated institution would not result in a fundamental \n25  alteration of the programs provided by MDCH. \n26 \n27 \n28 \n21 \n\nCase 5:02-cv-00044-DWM  Doc #1  Filed 03/19/02  Page 22 of 23   Page ID#22\n1  Count VIII -- MDCH Violation of the Rehabilitation Act:  Discriminatory Methods of \nAdministration \n2 \n124.  Plaintiffs restate Paragraphs 1 through 123. \n3 \n125.  Defendants have administered long term care services funded by Title XIX in such a \n4 \nmanner as to force the individual Plaintiffs to be unnecessarily segregated or at risk of unnecessary \n5 \nsegregation. \n6 \n126.  Defendants violate Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act by using methods of \n7 \nadministration that have the effect of subjecting the individual Plaintiffs to discrimination on the \n8 \nbasis of disability.  29 U.S.C. §794(a); 28 C.F.R. §41.51(b);  45 C.F.R. §84.4(b)(4)(1). \n9 \nRELIEF REQUESTED \n10 \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request that this Court: \n11 \nA.  Assume jurisdiction over this case; \n12 \nB.  Issue declaratory relief that Defendants have violated Plaintiffs' rights under the \n13 \nMedicaid Act, Title II of the ADA, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act; \n14 \nC.  Issue appropriate preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to enjoin defendants \n15 \nfrom continuing to violate the Medicaid Act, Title II ofthe ADA, and Section 504 of \n16 \nthe Rehabilitation Act and to require defendants to implement the Home and \n17 \nCommunity Based Waiver Program fully and immediately. \n18 \nD.  Order Defendants to immediately: \n19 \n(1) Admit the individual Plaintiffs into the Home and Community Based Waiver \n20 \nProgram and to fund for them all medically necessary and appropriate services available under the \n21 \nwmver; \n22 \n(2) Notify all individuals who are currently eligible for or who apply for Medicaid-\n23 \nfunded long term care services ofthe existence ofthe Home and Community Based Waiver \n24 \nProgram. \n25 \n(3) Immediately accept and process to completion applications for participation in the \n26 \nHome and Community Based Waiver Program. \n27 \n28  22 \n\nCase 5:02-cv-00044-DWM  Doc #1  Filed 03/19/02  Page 23 of 23   Page ID#23\n1  (4) For each eligible applicant for the Home and Community Based Waiver Program, \n2  fund all medically necessary and appropriate services available under the waiver for no fewer than \n3  15,000 individuals per year. \n4  (5) Maintain waiting lists for all individuals who appear to be eligible for the waiver \n5  program. \n6  (6 ) Implement a plan to provide with reasonable promptness home and community \n7  based waiver services or other comparable community-based services to individuals on the waiting \n8  list to avoid unnecessary institutionalization or continued unnecessary segregation. \n9  E.  Issue such other injunctive relief as shall be necessary to enjoin defendants from \n10  continuing to violate the individual Plaintiffs' rights to community-based services pursuant to the \n11  Medicaid Act, the ADA, and § 504 ofthe Rehabilitation Act. \n12  F.

Executive Director of the Tri-County Office on Aging \nMarion Owen, being duly sworn, deposes and says: \n1.  I am the Executive Director of the Tri-County Office on Aging, an Area Agency on \nAging located in Lansing, Michigan. \n2.  The Tri-County Office on Aging is a waiver provider in Michigan's Home and \nCommunity Based Waiver Program \n3. Since 1992,  I have served as the Director ofthe Waiver Program in the Tri-County \nOffice on Aging. \n4.  Until October I, 200I, the Michigan Department of Community Health (MDCH) \nallotted a specific number of waiver \"slots\" to each waiver provider. \n5.  As a waiver provider, we were permitted to fill all the slots that had been allocated to \nus as long as the average daily aggregate cost of providing services to the waiver clients in those \nslots did not exceeq an amount determined by the state.  Thus, we knew that our total budget for \nthe waiver program, not including any additional funds the state agreed to provide for especially \nexpensive cases, was the average daily amount set by the state multiplied by the number of days \nwaiver clients in our slots remained in the program. \n6.  As of October 1, 2001, the beginning of the new State fiscal year, MDCH changed the \nfunding formula for the waiver program.  In FY 2002, MDCH offered the Tri-County Office on \nAging a contract for $6,937,561, an amount that represented a 25 percent less than the \n$9,202,230 MDCH paid the agency for waiver services in FY 2001. \n7.  I understand from my contacts with staff at other Area Agencies on Aging that in FY \n2002, they were also subject to substantial cuts, generally in excess of 20 percent, over the \nfunding provided by MDCH for the waiver program in previous years. \n8.  As of September 30, 200I, the Tri-County Office on Aging was providing services to \n583 individuals in the waiver program and was obligated to continue to serve these \"carry-over \nclients\" in the new fiscal year as long as the clients remained financially and medically eligible \nfor the program. \n9.  Because of the reduction in funding for the waiver program for FY 2002, the Tri \nCounty Office on Aging was not able to accept any new waiver clients into the program after \nOctober I, 2000. \nI 0.  All the funding the Tri-County Office on Aging  receives for the waiver program for \nthis fiscal year will be needed to pay for services for existing clients.  The agency fears that  the \nApp. :2 \n\nCase 5:02-cv-00044-DWM  Doc #1-3  Filed 03/19/02  Page 2 of 2   Page ID#26\nfunds may not be sufficient to meet current clients' needs and is, in fact, already spending more \nthan its target aggregate daily average on waiver services. \nII. I understand that since October I, 200 I, only a very small number of new clients \nhave been admitted into the waiver program across the state.  Moreover, I understand that fewer \nthan II ,000 clients are being served statewide this fiscal year. \nI2.  Since the inception of the waiver program, waiver providers were specifically \ndirected by the Michigan Department of Community Health not to maintain waiting lists for \nwaiver applicants.  However, since September I, 200I, the Tri-County Office on Aging has been \ncontacted by more than 459 people who were seeking waiver services and who had to be turned \naway because the agency had insufficient funds to admit additional waiver clients. \n13.  Because many people knew that the Tri-County Office on Aging was unable to \naccept any new waiver clients this fiscal year, organizations including hospitals, health care \nproviders and others that previously referred clients to the waiver program ceased doing so and \nthe number of inquiries we received was far lower than I would have anticipated if we were able \nto provide services to new applicants. \nI4.  This declaration is based upon my personal knowledge, and if I am subpoenaed as a \nwitness, I can testify competently to the facts contained herein. \nI declare that the statements above are true and correct to the best of my \nknowledge, information and belief. \nMarion Owen, Executive Director, \nTri-County Office on Aging \n~  ~\\ \n'0!  , \nSubscribed and sworn to before me this~ day of  2001~1 ( \nMy Commission expires on: \n\n,  ,,.  ... ...,_ \nf  '1• •\" .. - ....

Introduction \n1.  The individual named plaintiffs, Robert Eager; Dora Oats, through her next friend Crystal \nOats; Terrell King; Georgette Kraft, through her husband and next friend Roy Kraft; Dennis \nLowe, through his guardian, Etta Dahlen;2 and Evelyn Wright, through her son and next friend, \nPaul Mayzes3 and the organizational plaintiffs, Michigan Disability Rights Coalition, Michigan \n, \nAssociation of Centers for Independent Living, Michigan Campaign for Quality Care, and Grand \nRapids Center for Independent Living4 and Defendants Jennifer Granholm, in her official \ncapacity as Governor of the State ofMichigan,5 and Janet Olszewski,6 in her official capacity as \nDirector of the Michigan Department of Community Health, enter into this Stipulation for \nSettlement (hereinafter \"this Stipulation\"). The parties will present this Stipulation to the Court \nfor its approval and entry of an order incorporating the terms of the Stipulation. \n2 \nOn June 18, 2003, Etta Dahlen, sister of plaintiff Dennis Lowe, was appointed to succeed John Munger as \nMr. Lowe's guardian by the Oakland County Probate Court. \n3 \nHoward Hugger, one of the original individual plaintiffs in this litigation, died on August I, 2002. \n4 \nGreat Lakes Center for Independent Living, one of the original organizational plaintiffs in this litigation, \nclosed and dissolved on April II, 2003. \n5 \nSee note I, supra. \n6.  See note I, supra. \n2 \n\nCase 5:02-cv-00044-DWM  Doc #30  Filed 12/15/03  Page 3 of 10   Page ID#97\nII.  Admission of the Named Plaintiffs to the MI Choice Program \n2.  As of the date of the signing of this Stipulation, each ofthe named Plaintiffs has been \nassessed by a local waiver provider and found eligible for services under the MI Choice program \nor is being assessed.  For some named Plaintiffs, plans of care have already been developed and \nimplemented.  For other named Plaintiffs, the parties anticipate plans of care will be developed \nand implemented.  In signing this Stipulation, Plaintiffs do not waive any rights or remedies that \nwould otherwise be available to them with respect to their eligibility for services under the MI \nChoice program or their receipt of services in the program. \nIII.  Definitions \nAs used herein, the following terms are to be given the meanings set forth below: \n3.  \"Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)\" is the branch of the United States \nDepartment of Health and Human Services charged with the responsibility of the oversight and \nadministration of Medicaid programs, including home and community based waiver programs. \n4.  \"Transition Services\" are one-time, set-up expenses that may be paid for by the State and \nwhich are incurred to assist an individual in moving from a nursing facility to a home or \napartment in the community.  Examples of transition services that the Department could choose \nto provide as authorized waiver services include, but are not limited to: \na.  Security deposits that are required to obtain a lease on an apartment or home; \nb.  Essential furnishings and moving expenses required to occupy and use a \ncommunity domicile; \nc.  Set-up fees or deposits for utility or service access (e.g., telephone, electricity, \nheating); \nd.  Health and safety assurances, such as pest eradication, allergen control or one-\n3 \n\nCase 5:02-cv-00044-DWM  Doc #30  Filed 12/15/03  Page 4 of 10   Page ID#98\ntime cleaning prior to occupancy; \ne.  Purchase of durable medical equipment. \nf.  Case management for coordination and planning of transition services. \n5.  \"Department\" means the Michigan Department of Community Health (MDCH) or its \nsuccessor agency.  The Medical Services Administration within MDCH has been designated as \nthe single state agency responsible for administering the Michigan Medicaid Program, pursuant \nto 42 U.S.C. § 1396a. \n6.  \"MI Choice Program\" means those home and community based services for the elderly \nand disabled as well as the administrative and programmatic activities of the state and its waiver \nagents which are provided by the State, under the authority of 42 U.S.C. § 1396n and M.C.L. \n400.109c, or which may be required ofthe State pursuant to federal regulation, the terms and \nconditions of its waiver application, or other authority.  As used in this Stipulation, reference to \n\"MI Choice\" also includes any amended or new waiver program for home and community based \nservices for the elderly or disabled. \n7.  A \"nursing facility\" is the type of institution referred to in 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(a) and its \nimplementing regulations. \n8.  \"Waiver agents\" are any and all entities approved by the Department to accept \napplications for MI Choice program services, assess applicants for MI Choice program services, \nand provide and/or arrange for MI Choice program services. \n9.  \"Waiver slots\" refers to the unduplicated number of individuals that may be served by \nDefendants through the MI Choice waiver program in a waiver contract year, in accordance with \nthe authority granted to the Michigan Department of Community Health by the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services. \n4 \n\nCase 5:02-cv-00044-DWM  Doc #30  Filed 12/15/03  Page 5 of 10   Page ID#99\nIV.  Waiver Slots for FY03 \n10.  Pursuant to agreement of the parties, MDCH opened MI Choice enrollment to \napproximately 1745 new participants during FY 03.  The division of Waiver slots among Waiver \nAgents, reimbursement for Waiver services, and other details pertaining to the operation of the \nprogram was substantially similar to the manner in which the program operated prior to such \nagreement and in conformity with the State's representations in the waiver application recently \napproved by CMS. \nV.  Waiver Funding for FY04 \n11.  Defendants shall allocate to waiver agents not less than $1 00 million for the MI Choice \nwaiver for FY 2003-2004.  MDCH shall in good faith seek legislative approval and approval \nfrom CMS to convert certain expenditures to personal care expenditures.  In the event that the \nnecessary approvals are obtained, Defendants shall allocate to waiver agents for the MI Choice \nwaiver for FY 2003-2004 not less than $100 million plus the additional funds generated by this \nconversion.  Such conversion is anticipated to make an additional $25 million available for the \nMI Choice program.  Defendants shall also make a good faith effort to increase the MI Choice \nwaiver budget by an additional $25 million through reallocation of funds from other long term \ncare (LTC) services.  Nothing in this Stipulation shall prohibit or discourage Defendants from \nallocating funds in excess of $150 million for the MI Choice program in FY04. \nVI.  Public Information, Training, and Education \n12.  a.  Within six months, MDCH shall develop and distribute public information and \neducational materials about long term care options to consumers, families, providers, and other \ninterested parties.  These materials will include information about long-term care services \nincluding, in particular, the MI Choice program, eligibility requirements, and application \n5 \n\nCase 5:02-cv-00044-DWM  Doc #30  Filed 12/15/03  Page 6 of 10   Page ID#100\nprocesses.  In addition, they will include contact information for a variety of provider and \nadvocacy groups (e.g., the Long Term Care Ombudsman, centers for independent living, area \nagencies on aging, etc.). \nThese materials will be distributed widely with a one-time mailing to current Medicaid \nfunded LTC consumers and to all Medicaid-enrolled providers.  Thereafter, these materials or \nsimilar materials as updated will be mailed or provided to consumers upon completion of an \napplication to the Family Independence Agency for Medicaid funded long term- care.  In \naddition, materials will be available on an on-going basis as with other MDCH publications.  In \naddition, the content will be posted and available on the MDCH Long Term Care website and \nMiSeniors.net. \nb.  Within nine months, MDCH will develop and implement a process to ensure informed \nchoice for beneficiaries who meet nursing facility level of care.  This process will be \npromulgated as policy and incorporated into the program requirements for nursing facility and \nMI Choice waiver providers.  The process will require providers to educate consumers about \nlong term care options, including distribution of MDCH developed educational materials.  A \nspecific MDCH form will be developed that will require an attestation by the hospital discharge \nplanner, provider or other professional assisting the applicant and an acknowledgment by the \napplicant or his/her representative that long term care options were fully described and discussed, \nincluding the MI Choice program. \nc.  Implementation of an informed choice process will include training for hospital \ndischarge planners, long term care ombudsman staff, long term care providers, and other \ninterested parties regarding informed consent and long term care options including, in particular, \nthe MI Choice program.  The initial training shall take place within nine months after the Court's \n6 \n\nCase 5:02-cv-00044-DWM  Doc #30  Filed 12/15/03  Page 7 of 10   Page ID#101\napproval of this Stipulation.  Follow-up training will be provided annually. \nd.  Defendants shall provide to counsel for plaintiffs draft copies of all documents, \nmaterials, forms, etc. required to implement the provisions of this paragraph and afford counsel \nreasonable opportunity to comment. \nVII.  Uniform Medical/Functional Eligibility Criteria \n13.  MDCH will utilize the identical functional/medical eligibility criteria for both applicants \nto the MI Choice Waiver program and applicants for Medicaid-funded nursing facility care, both \nunder the current waiver and under any new or amended waiver submitted to CMS in accordance \nwith this Stipulation.  Within 9 months ofthe date of this Agreement, MDCH intends to submit \nto CMS its application for a new and/or amended home and community based waiver for the \nelderly and disabled.  Through this application and a concurrent proposed state plan amendment, \nMDCH intends to request approval to alter the current eligibility criteria for long term care, \nincluding home and community based waiver services and nursing facility care.  MDCH will \npublish the proposed eligibility criteria as a Medicaid Proposed Policy concurrent with the \nsubmission of the application to CMS and seek public input before implementation.  Concurrent \nwith implementation of its new or amended waiver program, MDCH shall implement a checklist \nthat will be used by waiver agents and nursing facility providers to document the basis for each \nmedical eligibility or ineligibility determination.  The completed checklist for each client shall be \nmaintained by the respective provider.  If a client is determined to be medically ineligible for \nadmission into either the waiver program or the nursing facility, the client shall be sent a written \nnotice informing the client of his or her available appeal rights.  The development of new \neligibility criteria for Medicaid-funded long term care is not required by this Stipulation, nor are \nPlaintiffs requesting that MDCH take this action. \n7 \n\nCase 5:02-cv-00044-DWM  Doc #30  Filed 12/15/03  Page 8 of 10   Page ID#102\nVIII.  Contact Logs and Waiting Lists \n14.  Within one month of approval by the Court of this Stipulation, and until a waiting list \nprocedure is approved by CMS, DCH shall instruct waiver agents to maintain a log of \nindividuals who request to participate in the waiver program.  The log may be used to provide \ninformation to those who have indicated an interest in participating in the program as well as to \nprovide information to waiver agents and DCH about the numbers and/or characteristics of those \nwho have expressed an interest in the program. Within 9 months of the date of the Court's \napproval of this Stipulation, MDCH shall develop, and submit to CMS for approval, procedures \nfor creating and utilizing waiting lists and shall implement such procedures upon approval by \nCMS. \nIX.  Transition Services \n15.  DCH shall make a good faith effort to seek and use funding focused on helping \nindividuals transition from nursing facilities into available community-based settings. Subject to \nthe availability of funds, DCH shall consider requesting an amendment to the MI Choice waiver \nto include transition services as a covered service. \nX.  Medicaid Long Term Care Task Force \n16.  Within two months of approval by the Court ofthis Stipulation, the Governor shall create \na Medicaid Long Term Care Task Force to assist the State of Michigan in developing options for \nexpanding the availability ofhome and community-based long-term care services and for \nimproving long term care services.  The task force shall include representatives of state agencies, \nproviders, legislators or their representatives, advocates and consumers.  The charge of the task \nforce shall include, but not be limited to, promoting a full array of community based care options \nfor Michigan citizens in need of long term care, identifying barriers to the creation of and access \n8 \n\nCase 5:02-cv-00044-DWM  Doc #30  Filed 12/15/03  Page 9 of 10   Page ID#103\nto an efficient and effective system of community based care, and to make recommendations to \nthe Governor and the Legislature.  The task force shall consist of21 members:  seven each from \nconsumers and consumer advocacy groups, provider groups, and governmental/legislative \nentities.  The Task Force may create subcommittees as needed and appoint additional individuals \nto serve on such subcommittees if deemed appropriate by the Task Force.  The Task Force shall \ndeliver an interim report to the Governor and to the Chairs of the House and Senate \nSubcommittees on Appropriations for the Michigan Department of Community Health within six \nmonths of the formation of the Task Force, and a final report within a year of the formation of \nthe Task Force unless the Governor chooses to extend the deadlines, duties and/or period of \nservice of the Task Force. \nXI.  Miscellaneous \n17.  This Stipulation is the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject \nmatter hereof and supersedes any and all prior oral and written discussions and all agreements. \nEach party represents that it has not relied upon any statement of the other party except those \nstatements set forth in this Stipulation. \n18.  By mutual agreement, the parties may change the terms ofthis Stipulation, including, but \nnot limited to, the timetables for taking specific actions, provided that such mutual agreement be \nmemorialized in writing and signed by the parties and approved by the Court.  In the event that \none party disagrees as to the appropriateness of any change proposed by the other party, the \nparties shall meet to attempt to resolve such dispute.  Should the parties fail to reach agreement, \neither party may file appropriate motions with the Court. \n19.  Plaintiffs agree that they will notify Defendants in writing of any alleged non-compliance \nwith the Stipulation and request a meeting for the purpose of attempting to resolve the problem \n9 \n\nCase 5:02-cv-00044-DWM  Doc #30  Filed 12/15/03  Page 10 of 10   Page ID#104\nor problems identified by the Plaintiffs regarding the alleged non-compliance. \n20.  Should the parties fail to resolve the problems identified by the Plaintiffs, or should there \nbe dispute as to any item contemplated by this Stipulation or the failure of Defendants to comply \nwith the provisions of Stipulation, Plaintiffs may file a motion with the court seeking a judicial \ndetermination that Defendants are in substantial non-compliance. \n22.  By entering into and complying with this Stipulation, no party makes any concession as \nto the merits of the opposing party's claims or defenses. \n23.  The Court shall retain continuing jurisdiction of this case for the purpose of enforcing the \nterms of this Stipulation. \nThe parties shall bear their own costs and attorneys fee. \n~il~w~ \nMark A.

      "text": " \n \n \n \n \n  The MiChoice Program and Eager, et al. v. Engler, et al.: \n  Using Olmstead to Expand Home and Community Based Care in Michigan \n \n  Presentation to the Governor’s Task Force on Medicaid Long Term Care \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMark Cody, Michigan Protection and Advocacy Service, Inc. \nAlison Hirschel, Michigan Poverty Law Program \n \nSeptember 13, 2004 \n \n \n \nI.      Introduction \n\n \nThank you for inviting us to speak about two important civil rights cases: the 1999 \nUnited States Supreme Court case, Olmstead v. L.C., and the litigation we were privileged to \npursue, Eager, et al.  v. Engler, et al.  The Eager case, filed in 2002,  sought to reopen and \nexpand participation in MiChoice, Michigan’s home and community based waiver program, \nwhich was virtually closed to new admissions in the fall of 2001. The settlement order in this \ncase was entered in February of this year. As  you know, one element of the settlement was a \nrequirement that the Governor create this very task force.  Thus, we are especially pleased to be \npresenting here today.  \n \n We know RoAnne invited us to speak because she thought it was important that \neveryone on the task force understand the legal framework for the state’s efforts to rebalance the \nlong term care system.  Some of you already have a sophisticated understanding of this.  But \nthere are two crucial points we need to ensure everyone understands: \n \n1.   First, providing services and supports to people with disabilities in the most \n  integrated setting possible is not just a nice idea or one that is responsive to consumer \ndemand.  It’s required by federal law and that law has been upheld by the United States Supreme \nCourt.   Michigan, like all other states, has significant legal obligations pursuant to that law, and \nit has been far slower to meet those obligations than many other states.   \n \n2.    Second, while the Eager case resulted in the creation of the Task Force, the reopening of \nthe MiChoice program to new applicants, and a number of other important steps toward \nrebalancing the long term care system, it is only a baby step toward a coordinated system of long \nterm care that allows consumers real choice, quality, and dignity.  Lawsuits have to be narrowly \nfocussed and settlements are by their very nature compromises, so the settlement of this lawsuit \nmerely starts the ball rolling.   \n \nIt will be largely up to this Task Force, working hand in hand with the Administration and the \nlegislature, to ensure that true reform is achieved. \n \nII.   The Olmstead Decision \n \nWhen it enacted the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in 1990, Congress found \nthat the history of individuals with disabilities in this country was one of isolation and \nsegregation and that, despite some improvements, this reality was a continuing, serious, and \npervasive form of discrimination. 42 USC §12101(2)(5).  In Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 \n(1999), the United States Supreme Court considered the remedies the ADA provided for people \nwith disabilities who were isolated and segregated in an institution and declared that unjustified \nisolation of individuals with disabilities is a form of discrimination.  In so doing, the Court made \nwhat is arguably its most important civil rights decisions in decades.   \n \nThe case began in 1995 when two women with mental retardation and psychiatric \nconditions -- L.C. and E.W. -- contacted the Atlanta Legal Aid Society to ask for help leaving \nthe state institution in which they were confined.  The treating professionals at the facility agreed \nthat the two women could live successfully in the community if they had the necessary supports, \n\nand that Georgia offered community programs that could meet their needs.  Unfortunately, the \nwomen continued to languish in a state facility simply because the community programs had no \navailable slots.   \n \n   The plaintiffs argued that by failing to place them in a community program, the State of \nGeorgia was violating “the integration mandate,” a regulation adopted by the United States \nDepartment of Justice to enforce the ADA.  This regulation states: \n \nA public entity shall administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated \n  setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.  28 C.F.R. \n  §35.130(d). \n \nPlaintiffs alleged that the state, as public entity, was providing services, programs, and activities \n such as habilitation services, medical treatment, therapy, etc. that could be offered in the \ncommunity, a more integrated and appropriate setting.  The District Court found for the plaintiffs \nand the decision was affirmed by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.  The State then \nappealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.    \n \nIn affirming the ruling of the lower courts that unjustified isolation of persons with \ndisabilities in institutions is a form of discrimination, the Court took note of two factors.  First, \nunjustified isolation perpetuates the notion that those affected are unworthy or incapable of \nparticipating in community life.  Second, confinement in an institution diminishes everyday life \nactivities such as family relations, social contacts, work options, economic independence, \neducational advancement and cultural enrichment.  To obtain the supports they needed, people \nwith disabilities were required to sacrifice the essential elements of a complete life.   \n \n   By declaring the unjustified isolation of people with disabilities to be a form of \ndiscrimination and thus a violation of the ADA, the Supreme Court gave every person with a \ndisability -- young and old alike -- a potential claim against a state that requires them to remain \nin a facility or to enter a facility to receive services which could be provided in the community.  \nThe decision was not a complete victory for advocates, however, because the Court noted that \nstates could prevail if they demonstrated that moving a large number of individuals out of \ninstitutions and into the community would fundamentally alter the nature of the state’s programs. \n Unfortunately, the Supreme Court gave little guidance as to what would constitute a successful \n“fundamental alteration” defense.  A plurality of the Court suggested that a state could establish \na defense if it demonstrated that it had a comprehensive, effectively working plan for moving \nindividuals into the community and a waiting list for community based services that was moving \nat a reasonable pace and not controlled by the state’s desires to keep its facilities fully populated.  \n \nAn excellent source of additional information about the Olmstead decision can be found \nat www.bazelon.org.  \n \n \nIII.   The Response to Olmstead \n \nIn response to the Olmstead decision, an Executive Order was issued by the President in \n\nearly 2001.  This Executive Order directed all federal agencies to swiftly implement the \nOlmstead decision.  It also created the New Freedom Initiative and required all federal agencies \nto examine their programs, policies and services to determine how those activities could be \nimproved to promote the integration of people with disabilities into community life.  Those \nreports have been compiled and are available at: www.hhs.gov/newfreedom/final/. \n \nOf particular interest to this Task Force is the report of the U.S. Department of Health \nand Human Services, found at:  http://www.hhs.gov/newfreedom/final/hhs.html.  That report \nattributes much of the overuse of institutions to the bias in the Medicaid system that favors \ninstitutional placement.  The report details a number of measures that states could take to \nrebalance their Medicaid systems in ways that would promote community integration.  HHS has \nissued, through its Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a number of letters to state \nMedicaid directors informing them of options and opportunities for rebalancing.    \n \nBeyond studies and reports, the federal government has also been active in enforcing the \nOlmstead decision.  Just last month, the U.S. Department of Justice issued a findings letter in \nwhich it detailed its determination that the State of California is violating the civil rights of \nnursing home residents in a particular facility by impeding the right of those individuals to \nreceive services in the most integrated setting possible.  Specifically, the state was cited for \ncontributing to unnecessary isolation by: (1)failing to ensure that residents are adequately and \ntimely assessed for placement in non-institutional settings upon admission and regularly \nthereafter; (2)failing to adequately inform residents of home and community based options and \nalternatives; and (3)failing to provide sufficient meaningful community options to reasonably \naccommodate residents who need placements, along with the supports and services they need to \nlive in those settings.  The complete findings letter is located at:  \nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/documents/laguna_honda_findlet_aug3.pdf \n \nTo assess the progress states are making to implement the Olmstead decision, the \nNational Conference of State Legislatures has twice surveyed the states and issued a report on \nefforts and innovative practices.  Unfortunately, Michigan has not fared well in either report.   \nFor example, in the report issued in February 2004 for calendar year 2003, 29 states were \nidentified as having an Olmstead plan or report.  Michigan was not among them.  \n \n \nIV.   The MiChoice Program \n \nThe Home and Community Based Waiver for the Elderly and Disabled is a nationwide \nprogram which has been administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \n(formerly HCFA) since the early 1980s.  In 1992, when Michigan initiated the MiChoice pilot \nproject in 11 counties, it was one of the last states in the country to take advantage of this federal \ninitiative.  The program gradually expanded until it became available statewide in 1998.  In \n2001, MIChoice served almost 15,000 individuals.  \nUnder the program, individuals who qualify for Medicaid funded nursing home care may \nreceive more than a dozen long term care services at home including personal care, \nhomemaking, respite care, home delivered meals, chore services, and other assistance.  The state \nenters into contracts with waiver agents, including all the state’s Area Agencies on Aging and a \n\nnumber of other nonprofit providers, to administer the program in 16 regions of the state.  \nWaiver agents are responsible for screening and assessment of applicants, care planning, \norchestrating the provision of services, data collection, and financial management of their \nprograms.  Although there was virtually no publicity about MiChoice, demand for the program \nconsistently outstripped the supply of waiver slots and the program was full long before the end \nof each fiscal year.  \n \nOn October, 1, 2001, then Governor Engler restricted funding to the waiver program, \nthus resulting in the closure of the program to virtually all new applicants and, ultimately, in a \ndevastating reduction in the number of waiver clients served.  Currently, we have fewer than two \nthirds the number of waiver participants we had in 2001.  And that means in virtually all parts of \nthe state, including where most of you live, if your neighbors or family member or friends seek  \nwaiver services to get out of or stay out of a nursing home, they will likely face long waiting \nlists.  \n \nV.   Eager v. Engler \n \nA.   Background \n \nIn March, 2002, seven individual plaintiffs and five organizational plaintiffs filed Eager, \net al. v. Engler, et al. to challenge the virtual closure of the MiChoice Program to new \napplicants.  The claims in that case arose under the Medical Assistance Act, the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  We were privileged to \nrepresent the plaintiffs in that case.   \n \nThe lawsuit alleged several violations of the Medicaid law and that the State was \nunlawfully and unnecessarily segregating people with disabilities in nursing homes rather than \nserving them in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs -- their own homes.  \nPlaintiffs requested declaratory and injunctive relief including an Order requiring the admission \nof the individual plaintiffs to the waiver program, reopening of the program, the creation of \nwaiting lists for MiChoice, and the provision of information to the public about the MiChoice \nprogram. \n \nB.    The Individual Plaintiffs \n \nThe individual plaintiffs in the lawsuit represent the vast variety of Michigan citizens \nwho need long term care.  They ranged in age from 29 to 100, were African American and white, \nresided in nursing homes or were just barely surviving in the community, and lived in both urban \nand rural settings across the state.  When we talk about long term care reform, in all its \ncomplexity, we sometimes forget the power and the poignancy of the lives of individual long \nterm care consumers and the reason -- along with the state’s budgetary constraints and the \nrequirements of the law -- that it is so important that we create long term care options where \npeople want to receive them -- in their own homes and communities.  Thus, we want to take a \nminute to share with you the stories of some of our plaintiffs: \n \n(cid:136)  Robert Eager is a divorced, middle aged Traverse City resident with three children who \n\n  was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis that has progressed very rapidly.  A former \nfactory   supervisor, Mr. Eager, is now challenged and exhausted by virtually every \nactivity of   daily living.  Despite his very significant and progressive disability, Mr. Eager \nfeared and   dreaded nursing home placement because it would take him away from his \nchildren.    Though normally a genial and optimistic person, Mr. Eager repeatedly stated that \nhe   would refuse food and water if forced to enter a nursing home.  Because of the settlement \n  of this lawsuit, Mr. Eager now receives a moderate number of waiver services which \n  enable him to remain home with his children.  Through sheer determination, courage,  \n  and the kindness of friends, Mr. Eager managed to remain in the community during the \n  pendency of the lawsuit. When we told him the case had settled and he would finally get   \nthe waiver services he needed, he cried with joy and so did we. \n \n(cid:136)  Terrell King is a 31 year old Detroit resident who resided in Madonna nursing home for \n  many years.  He was  paralyzed from the neck down as the result of a football injury in \n  1992 and entered the nursing home after his mother was no longer able to care for him at \n  home. Mr. King was desperate to leave the nursing home so that he could enjoy a social \n  life and lifestyle more appropriate to his age and so that he could pursue an education.  \nAs   a result of the settlement, Mr. King  left the nursing home and regained his freedom. \n \n(cid:136)  Georgette Kraft is an elderly woman who suffers from Alzheimers Disease.  Her devoted \n  husband of many years took care of her until his own declining health forced him to \n  place her in a nursing home.  Both Mr. and Mrs. Kraft wanted only to spend their last \n  days together in their own home.  Because of the settlement of the lawsuit, they will be \n  able to do so. \n \n(cid:136)  Howard Hugger was 100 years old when we filed the lawsuit. After living independently \n  with waiver services, he had several falls and was ultimately forced to enter a nursing \n  home.  During his stay, he lost a substantial amount of weight, was dissatisfied with his \n  care, became sluggish and depressed, and constantly asked  his niece, a 61 year old \n  woman with significant disabilities, to take him home with her.  Mr. Hugger’s niece \n  did take him home where Mr. Hugger appeared content, congenial and active. Although \n  Mr. Hugger’s niece lived in a small, unassuming home, Mr. Hugger declared it his \n  castle and stated repeatedly he wanted to spend the rest of his life there.  However,  \n  because of his niece’s own disabilities and the absence of waiver or other limited and \n  inexpensive support services  to help her bathe and care for  Mr. Hugger, she was \n  ultimately forced to take Mr. Hugger back to the nursing home not long after the suit was \n  filed.  He died there shortly thereafter.  Mr. Hugger didn’t have a happy ending to his \n  long life, but if waiver services had been available to him in his niece’s house, he would \n  have.  \n \nC.   The Settlement \nWe engaged in wide-ranging, detailed, thoughtful, and ultimately successful settlement \nnegotiations with the Granholm Administration over a period of many months last year.  The \nfinal Stipulation of Settlement was signed by Judge David McKeague of federal district court on \nFebruary 2, 2004.   The court will retain jurisdiction of the case during the implementation of the \nsettlement.   \n\n \nThe terms of the settlement provide both short term and longer term relief and serve as a \nstepping stone for future reform.  Among the provisions of the settlement are: \n \n(cid:136)  All surviving individual name plaintiffs have been admitted to the MiChoice program. \n \n(cid:136)  During FY ‘03, approximately 1745 new participants were admitted to the MiChoice \n  program. \n \n(cid:136)  For FY ‘04, the state was required to allocate no less than $100 million to the MiChoice \n  program.  However, with that limited allocation, the number of participants in the \n  program will continue and has continued  to decline.  Therefore, the state also agreed to \n  seek approval from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to convert certain \n  state only expenditures to Medicaid benefits, thus drawing down federal matching funds \n  in the amount of approximately $25 million. We were very greatly disappointed to learn \n  after the settlement of the case, however, that the state had discovered a technical \nobstacle   to obtaining this money and that it will not now be forthcoming.  Finally, the state \nagreed  to make good faith efforts to obtain an additional $25 million for the MiChoice program \n  through reallocation of other long term care funding, but they have been unable to \n  produce that funding.  Thus, while we are pleased that limited admissions to the program \n  have occurred as the result of the settlement, because funding for the program this year \n  has remained stalled at $100 million, far less than was spent on the program several years \n  ago, we are still going backwards, instead of forwards, in providing home and \ncommunity   based services. \n \n(cid:136)  DCH will make a number of efforts to ensure greater public understanding of long term \n  care options, including the MiChoice program, by developing, distributing and posting \n  public information and educational materials to consumers, families, providers, and other \n  interested parties.  These materials will be mailed to all current Medicaid recipients \n  receiving long term care and all Medicaid enrolled providers.  Thereafter, the materials \n  will be provided to all applicants to FIA for Medicaid-funded long term care.  In \naddition,    long term care providers will be required to distribute materials to consumers \napplying   for nursing facility or waiver services and both providers and consumers will be \nrequired   to sign a form that the information was provided.  Finally, DCH must organize an \n  annual training for interested parties such as long term care ombudsman staff and hospital \n  discharge planners to educate them about long term care options including the  \n  MiChoice program.  These efforts will both increase public understanding of the limited \n  home and community based options currently available and educate consumers and \n  providers that nursing homes need not be the only stop on the long term care continuum.  \n  We are pleased to report that DCH staff are working diligently and energetically to meet \n  these obligations and are working closely with us to ensure the consumer information is \n  clear and effective.  \n \n(cid:136)  DCH will utilize identical functional/medical criteria for both applicants for the  \n  MiChoice program and applicants to nursing facilities. Applicants found ineligible for \n  Medicaid funded long term care services will be given written notice of the  \n\n  determination and an opportunity to appeal.  The creation of identical functional and \n  medical criteria for admission to the waiver program and nursing facilities will correct \nthe   historical practice that only a doctor’s signature was required to be admitted to a nursing \n  home -- making it easy to gain admission to the most expensive long term care option -- \n  but a full screen was required before applicants were admitted to the waiver program, \n  making it more difficult to be approved for waiver services. DCH has already circulated \n  its draft screening criteria and sought public comment.  We understand the state  intends \n  to begin using this new tool in the next few months.  \n \n(cid:136)  Waiver agents are also now required to maintain “contact logs” to document the number \n  of applicants who request waiver services but for whom no services are currently  \n  available. Previously, waiver agents were instructed not to maintain such lists, making it \n  much harder to track consumer demand for the program.  The state is also seeking \n  approval from CMS to require waiting lists and has published  for public comment a \n  proposed policy regarding how waiting lists are to be maintained and utilized.  Under the \n  proposal, waiver agents must give priority to certain categories of applicants, notify the \n  state monthly of the number of people on the waiting list, and notify applicants monthly \n  of their progress up the waiting list.  \n \n(cid:136)  DCH is also required to make a good faith effort to seek and use funding to help  \n  individuals transition from nursing facilities into available community-based  \n  settings.  In the same proposed policy in which it described the waiting list requirements, \n  DCH has included information about how requests for transition funding will be handled, \n  and that policy is awaiting final promulgation.  \n \n(cid:136)  The final requirement in the settlement is the creation of this Task Force and the  \n  submission of an interim and final report by the Task Force.  Although the Task Force \n  began its work later than was anticipated in the settlement, we very much appreciate the \n  significant effort members are making to ensure it fulfills its obligations.  \n \nVI.   Conclusion and Recommendations \n \nAs we noted, these settlement elements, though significant, remain only a first step on the \nvery long road to ensuring all long term care consumers receive high quality and adequate \nservices and supports in the setting of their choice.  It is a road many other states embarked upon \nlong before we did.  We think, however, that there are three important next steps that we urge the \nTask Force to consider and which are essential to continue the progress begun in Eager: \n \n1.   The elastic expansion of the capacity of the MiChoice program to meet consumer \ndemand and eliminate waiting lists.   We understand the federal government will approve the \nState’s request for additional waiver slots and no rebalancing of the system is possible if these \nslots do not exist. The waiver agents’ waiting lists, combined with analysis of demographic data \nand other resources, can help us determine with relative accuracy how many waiver slots are \nrequired to meet demand.  Slot availability must be adjusted at least annually to respond to \nconsumers’ needs.  \n \n\n2.   Eliminate artificial funding caps for waiver services. Currently, waiver agents are \nlimited to an aggregate cap of $42/day per client--less than half the cost of nursing home care --  \ndespite the fact that federal law stipulates only that waiver services cannot, on average, exceed \nthe cost of nursing home care.  This artificial limitation prevents the waiver program from being \na true alternative to nursing home care for many eligible consumers and, according to AARP’s \nexpert, Dann Milne, may be the lowest limit in the United States.     \n \n3.    Invest substantially in transition services for individuals who wish to leave the \nnursing home.  The long term care system cannot be rebalanced as long as beds are filled with \npeople who do not need or want to be there. Advocates have documented that the average \nnursing home transition costs approximately $3000 including such expenses as security deposits, \ntransportation, purchase of household goods, home modifications, etc.-- less than the average \ncost of a month’s nursing home stay.   Some of the individuals who are able to relocate to the \ncommunity then require only minimal services or services that cost far less than \ninstitutionalization.  While the Department is proposing limited funding for transition costs, a \nmuch more substantial effort must be made to identify individuals who want to transition out of \nfacilities and to develop and implement transition plans to help them do so.  If we are truly \ncommitted to increasing community based services, we must pay the limited cost of permitting \ninstitutionalized consumers to access those services.  Moreover, many of these transitions will \nreap long term savings for the state. \n \nIn closing, we want to acknowledge the determined efforts of the multitude of \nstakeholders and advocates who supported us during the litigation and continue to push for \nreforms.  We also particularly appreciate the dedication of staff from the Michigan Department \nof Community Health who have worked hard to reach and implement the settlement.   Instead of \nbeing adversarial during our negotiations and subsequent conversations, they  have been \nconsistently thoughtful, professional, compassionate, open and collegial.  We are especially  \ngrateful to Paul Reinhart, Mary Gear, Deanna Mitchell, Steve Bachleda, Jan Christensen and \nSharon Gire.  In addition, we are delighted with RoAnne Chaney’s and Susan Steinke’s superb \nleadership on this Task Force and with the enormous commitment of the members of  the Task \nForce.   We look forward to working with all of you. ",
