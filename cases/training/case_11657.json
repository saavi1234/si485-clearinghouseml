The plaintiffs, represented by public services counsel, asked the Court for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that defendants had failed to maintain and operate Western Center in accordance with applicable standards and to provide residents with appropriate care and treatment; failed to keep residents free from harm and undue restraints; and discriminated against residents on the basis of their disability.</p><p>On November 29, 1991, the Court granted Allegheny County's motion to intervene as a plaintiff on the ground that about 60% of Western Center residents resided in the County before being institutionalized.</p><p>On February 21, 1921, the Court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification.</p><p>On September 10, 1992, after lengthy negotiations, the original plaintiffs and defendants signed a Settlement Agreement.  On February 3, 1993, defendants and Allegheny County signed the Settlement Agreement.</p><p>On October 7, 1992, the Court granted some institutions and natural persons to intervene as plaintiffs.  The opposing intervenors, opposing the settlement, filed a Statement Concerning Class Certification/Decertification on February 3, 1993.</p><p>On June 22, 1993, the Court (Judge William L. Standish) confirmed its preliminary certification of the class and approved the settlement agreement.</p><p>Following settlement, Western Center residents falling within the certified class and their family members or legal guardians filed separate motions to intervene as of right.  On September  29, 1999, the Court (Judge Standish) held that the Olmstead decision did not provide a basis for family members' intervention and that the residents' motion to intervene was untimely.</p><p></p>",

Accordingly,  the  class  representatives  have \nestablished the commonality and typicality requirements. \nIV \n  \n \nFindings of Fact: Settlement Agreement \nAdequacy of Representation \n33.  Representatives  of  plaintiffs  and  defendant  began \n*5 27. The adequacy of representation depends on two \nsettlement discussions in late 1991, approximately two \nfactors: “(a) the plaintiff’s attorney must be qualified, \nyears after this litigation was initiated. All parties who \nexperienced, and generally able to conduct the proposed \ntestified about the settlement discussions described them \nlitigation, and (b) the plaintiff must not have interests \nas  difficult  and  heated.  After  almost  one  year,  in \nantagonistic to those of the class.” Wetzel, 508 F.2d at \nSeptember, 1992 plaintiffs reached an agreement with \n247. \nDPW. After further negotiations based on the agreement, \n  \nAllegheny  County  signed  the  agreement  in  February, \n28. It is clear from the manner in which plaintiffs’ counsel \n1993. \nhave conducted themselves throughout the proceedings \n  \nleading to this point that counsel, in part based on past \n34. Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e), the court approved a \nexperience with similar litigation, are extremely qualified \nnotice to be sent to all class members. The notice invited \nand well able to conduct the proposed litigation. \nclass members to submit their objections to, or approval \n  \nof,  the  settlement  agreement,  or  to  participate  in  the \n29. Turning to the second factor, class counsel owes a \nhearing, if they so chose, by sending a written request to \nduty to the entire class, and not to any one interest or \nthe court prior to February 17, 1993. As of February 18, \ngroup of interests represented by the named plaintiffs. \n1993, 155 responses were received, with 19 individuals or \nWalsh v.

Id. \n  \n  \n \n30. Here, the opposing intervenors assert that counsel for \nthe representative individual plaintiffs (Richard C., et al.) \ncannot also represent the organizational plaintiffs (PP & \nCommunity Placement \nA and the ARCs) because the organizational plaintiffs \n“follow a philosophy that institutions such as Western  36.

PP & A provides no direct services. \n \n3  David G. was transferred to Ebensburg Center in May, 1990, however, he remains a member of the class. \n \n \n4  On February 24, 1993, the court called the name of every person or couple requesting to testify. Not all of the individuals or \ncouples were present, however, the court heard the testimony of the following people: Charles Cihil, Martin Dempsey, Walter \n \nKohut, Richard Welsh, Charles Miller, James Mooney, Laura Mooney and Aldo Giannini. Although Mr. Giannini had not \ncomplied with the procedures set forth in the notice of settlement, he had previously written to the court requesting to testify, and \nwith the agreement of all counsel, he was permitted to do so. On March 4, 1993, Mary Chiappino and Betty Lou McDevitt, who \nhad originally requested to testify, but who could not be present on February 24, 1993, were also permitted to testify. \n \n5  The agreement contains a “one-for-one” provision by which a county will receive funding to provide services for one person on \nthat county’s waiting list for each Western Center resident who is placed in the community and receives services in that county. \n \nThis provision does not affect the fairness or reasonableness of the agreement as it applies to class members, but it does extend the \nbenefits of the agreement to persons who are not class members. The provision is consistent with purpose of the Social Security \nAct provisions authorizing Home and Community Based Waivers, 42 U.S.C. § 1396(n). Without this provision, it is unlikely that \nthe county, and perhaps the state, would have agreed upon a settlement. Under this provision of the settlement agreement, a benefit \nis achieved which would not have been obtainable through litigation. \n \n6  The Girsh opinion set forth three additional factors: (a) the ability of the defendants to withstand a greater judgment; (b) the range \nof reasonableness of the settlement in light of the best possible recovery and (c) the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund \n \nto a possible recovery in light of all the attendant risks of litigation. These additional factors are directed toward class settlements \ninvolving monetary damages and are inapplicable to the instant action for equitable relief. \n \n \n \n \t\r  \n \n \n  \n  9 \n ",
