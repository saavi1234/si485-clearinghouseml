    "summary": "<p>On March 15, 2007, men and women who attended a music event at a nightclub in Flint, Michigan filed a class action lawsuit under 42 U.S.C § 1983 against the City of Flint Police Department and Genesee County Sheriff Department in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division. The plaintiffs, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan, asked the court for injunctive, declaratory, and monetary relief, alleging that police violated the plaintiff's rights against unreasonable search and seizure and freedom of speech, association and assembly under the United States Constitution. Plaintiffs also claimed state law violations including false arrest and false imprisonment, unlawful strip search under MCL §764.25a, unlawful body cavity search under MCL§764.25b, assault and battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p><p>On March 19, 2005 the plaintiffs attended an electronic music event at a night club in Flint, MI. The Flint Police Department and Genesee County Sheriff's Department sent undercover officers to the event. Four patrons allegedly sold drugs to the officers. Subsequently, the police arrested all patrons in the club. The plaintiffs were detained, charged with a crime, strip searched, and in some cases subjected to body cavity searches, because of their presence at the club. Plaintiffs were charged with Frequenting a Disorderly House (Flint City Ordinance §31-11). On October 13, 2006, the Genesee County Circuit Court ruled there was no probable cause for the plaintiffs' arrests, and on January 9, 2007, the charges were dismissed with prejudice.</p><p>On April 6, 2007 the District Court (Judge Paul v. Gadola) declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims and dismissed them without prejudice. The parties jointly sought reconsideration. On June 8, 2007 the District Court (Judge Gadola) vacated the order dismissing the state law claims. On September 4, 2008 the case was reassigned from District Judge Paul V. Gadola to District Judge Stephen J. Murphy, III. </p><p>On October 21, 2009 the parties reached a settlement agreement, which required the City of Flint to establish policies regarding strip searches and body cavity searches and to implement a training program for law enforcement officers regarding strip searches. On October 26, 2009 the plaintiffs filed a motion to certify the settlement class. On December 14, 2009, the District Court (Judge Stephen J. Murphy III) issued a consent decree approving the settlement agreement and settlement class. On February 23, 2010, the District Court (Judge Murphy) issued a stipulated order of dismissal with prejudice.</p><p></p>",

HONORABLE STEPHEN J. MURPHY, III\nCITY OF FLINT, et al.,\nDefendants.\n___________________________________/\nORDER CERTIFYING SETTLEMENT CLASS, AND APPROVING SETTLEMENT,\nATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COSTS, PLAN OF ALLOCATION, AND APPOINTMENT\nOF CLASS REPRESENTATIVE\nOn December 4, 2009, the Court held a preliminary fairness hearing with regard\nto the proposed settlement in this matter. Notice of the proposed settlement, proposed\nplan of allocation of settlement proceeds, class definition, right to object and right to\nattend this preliminary fairness hearing was given to the class by regular mail and\npublication at least 30 days before this hearing. Class members were notified that\nobjections must be filed by November 25, 2009 and no objections were filed as of that\ndate.  In addition, no persons or parties appeared before the Court at the fairness\nhearing with objections.  Having read and considered the Settlement Agreement, the\npleadings filed in this matter, the testimony of proposed class representative Jennifer\nThompson, the affidavit of Michael Pitt, and based upon the Court’s familiarity with the\nproceedings in this matter, the Court finds that: \n1. The  Court  has  subject  matter  jurisdiction  over  this  Action,  the  Class\nRepresentative, the Class and the Defendants.\n-1-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-11107-SJM-MJH     Document 79      Filed 12/14/2009     Page 2 of 4\n2. Notice of the proposed Settlement was timely disseminated in accordance with\nthe  terms  of  the  Order  Preliminarily  Approving  Settlement  Agreement,\nConditionally  Certifying  Class,  Approving  Class  Notice  and  Scheduling  First\nFairness Hearing entered on November 4, 2009.   Such notice satisfies the\nrequirements of Rule 23(c)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and due\nprocess.\n3. The proposed settlement and plan of allocation is fair, reasonable and adequate\nwithin the meaning of Rule 23(e)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In\nsupport of this finding this court finds as follows:\ni. The issues as to liability and damages are issues as to which there are\ngrounds for differences of opinion and the proposed settlement constitutes\na resolution of those issues that is fair, reasonable and adequate to the\nClass Members and settlement of these claims in the amount and under\nthe terms proposed is in the public interest.    \n          ii.  The allocation of the settlement proceeds between the Plaintiffs and their\ncounsel  is  fair  and  adequate.    The  plan  of  allocation  of  settlement\nproceeds amongst the class of plaintiffs described in the “Thompson Plan\nof  Allocation  of  Claimant  Awards”  dated  October  26,  2009  is  hereby\napproved.  An  awards  panel  consisting  of  retired  judge  Pamela  R.\nHarwood,  Kathleen  L.  Bogas,  an  attorney,  and  Daniel  Korobkin,  an\nattorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan, will render\nindividual  awards  and  allocate  settlement  proceeds  of  $564,470.04  to\nqualified class members.\n-2-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-11107-SJM-MJH     Document 79      Filed 12/14/2009     Page 3 of 4\niii. Class Counsels’ claim for payment of $282,235.01 in attorney fees and\n$53,294.95 in costs in conjunction with their prosecution of this matter is\nfair and reasonable.  In making this finding, the Court has considered the\naffidavit  of  attorney  Michael  Pitt,  the  pleadings  in  this  matter,  the\ncomplexity of the case,  the experience of class counsel, and the time and\neffort expended by class counsel. The Court finds that this fee will not in\nany way jeopardize the payment to the class members of their claims and\napproves the fee as being reasonable.   \n4. This Court holds Jennifer Thompson is an adequate class representative after\nhaving  considered  the  pleadings  and  the  affidavit  and  testimony  of  Jennifer\nThompson. In support of this holding, the Court finds Jennifer Thompson’s claims\nare  typical  of  the  class,  she  has  actively  participated  in  the  litigation  and\ncooperated with counsel, and therefore that she is a suitable representative of\nthe class. Therefore, this court appoints Jennifer Thompson class representative.\n5. The Court has set a final fairness hearing for 2:00 p.m. on February 16, 2010\nin Courtroom 228 of the Theodore Levin United States District Courthouse, at\n231 West Lafayette Boulevard in Detroit, Michigan.  Only timely objections to\nindividual class member awards will be heard at the final fairness hearing. \nWHEREFORE,  it  is  hereby  ORDERED  that  the  terms  of  the  Settlement\nAgreement, the Plan of Allocation, the request for attorney fees and costs, and the\nappointment of Jennifer Thompson as class representative are approved by the Court\nas being fair, just and reasonable for the reasons set forth above.  \n-3-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-11107-SJM-MJH     Document 79      Filed 12/14/2009     Page 4 of 4\nIt is further ORDERED that the member class is CERTIFIED for purposes of\nsettlement only.  This matter shall proceed to a final fairness hearing in the manner set\nforth above.   \nSO ORDERED.\ns/Stephen J. Murphy, III                             \nSTEPHEN J.

INTRODUCTION\nThis is a putative class action brought under 42 U.S.C. §1983 and Michigan law.\nPlaintiffs are forty-one individuals who were arrested and strip searched by Defendant\npolice officers while attending an electronic music event at a licensed nightclub in Flint on\nMarch 20, 2005.1  There are forty-five named Defendants, including the City of Flint,\nGenesee County, Flint Police Chief, Genesee County Sheriff, and the individual law\nenforcement officers involved in the events.  On March 15, 2007, Plaintiffs filed a seven-\ncount complaint in this Court, and amended the complaint on March 20, 2007.  \nCounts I and II of the amended complaint allege violations of 42 U.S.C. §1983 for\ndeprivations under the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.\nThe remaining counts are state law claims alleging false arrest and false imprisonment\n1 Each of the Plaintiffs was issued a ticket for a misdemeanor, Frequenting a Disorderly\nHouse under Section 31-11(e) of a Flint City Ordinance. On October 13, 2006, the Genesee\nCounty Circuit Court ruled there was no probable cause for the Plaintiffs’ arrests, and on January\n9, 2007, the charges were dismissed with prejudice.\n-5-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-11107-SJM-MJH   Document 17    Filed 04/19/07   Page 6 of 11\n(Count III); unlawful strip searches and body cavity searches in violation of MCL §764.25a\nand §764.25b, respectively (Counts IV and V); assault and battery (Count VI); and\nintentional infliction of emotional distress (Count VII) under Michigan law.  \nOn April 6, 2007, this Court sua sponte entered an Order of Partial Dismissal\nWithout Prejudice, dismissing all of Plaintiffs’ state claims and retaining jurisdiction over\nthe § 1983 federal claims in Count I and Count II.  The Court declined to exercise\nsupplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ state law claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1367.  \nFor the reasons set forth below, Plaintiffs request that the Court reconsider its April\n6, 2007 Order of Partial Dismissal Without Prejudice and reinstate Counts III through VII.\n Defendants concur in the relief requested in this Motion.\nII.  ARGUMENT\nSection 1367 of Title 28 provides that “the district court shall have supplemental\njurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such\noriginal jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy.”  28 U.S.C. §\n1367(a).  In interpreting this Section, the Sixth Circuit court has stated “if there is some\nbasis  for  original  jurisdiction,  the default  assumption  is  that  the  court will  exercise\nsupplemental jurisdiction over all related claims.”  Campanella v. Commerce Exch. Bank,\n137 F.3d 885, 892 (6th Cir. 1998) (emphasis added).  \nA district court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a state claim\nonly if one of the following four exceptions to §1367 apply:\n(1) the claim raises a novel or complex issue of State law;\n(2) the claim substantially predominates over the claim or claims\nover which the district court has original jurisdiction,\n-6-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-11107-SJM-MJH   Document 17    Filed 04/19/07   Page 7 of 11\n(3)  the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has\noriginal jurisdiction, or\n(4)  in  exceptional  circumstances,  there  are  other compelling\nreasons for declining jurisdiction. \n28 U.S.C. § 1367(c).   \nIn its Order, this Court declined supplemental jurisdiction based on the second\n(predominating federal claims) and fourth (exceptional circumstances) exceptions to\n§1367.  Specifically, the Order states, in relevant part:\nPlaintiff’s state law claims would substantially expand the scope of this case\nbeyond that necessary and relevant to the federal law claims.”  [citations\nomitted].  Moreover, the Court finds that judicial economy, convenience,\nfairness, and comity counsel against exercising supplemental jurisdiction in\nthis  case.  [citation  omitted].  Therefore,  the  Court  declines  to  exercise\nsupplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s state law claims, Count III through\nVII.\nOrder, page 4.  \nThe Court’s Order should be reconsidered because it erroneously finds that (1) state\nlaw claims  predominate over the federal claims and unnecessarily expand the scope of\nthe suit; and (2) separating the state law claims from the federal law claims is in the best\ninterest of judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and comity.  As set forth in Plaintiffs’\nAmended Complaint, the same conduct giving rise to the federal claims forms the basis\nfor the state claims.  Moreover, the fact that this action is a putative class action brought\nagainst  multiple  governmental  entities,  officials,  and  employees  presents  unique\ncircumstances that necessitate reconsideration by the Court.  \nA. Federal Claims Predominate Over State Claims \n  The federal claims in this action are constitutional claims.  Plaintiffs allege that\nDefendants violated their rights under the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution,\n-7-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-11107-SJM-MJH   Document 17    Filed 04/19/07   Page 8 of 11\nmade applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, by unlawfully arresting\nthem and conducting unreasonable searches of their person and property without probable\ncause.   Plaintiffs further allege that Defendants violated their First Amendment rights by\ntargeting and restraining them in their exercise of freedom of expression, association and\nassembly with others who share a mutual interest in electronic music.\nPlaintiffs’ state claims allege false arrest/imprisonment, assault and battery, illegal\nstrip searches and body searches, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.  All of\nthese claims are based on the same factual allegations supporting Plaintiffs’ §1983 claim\nbased on unreasonable search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment to the U.S.\nConstitution.  These claims are often adjudicated in one action, as for example a case in\nthis Court, Chancellor v. City of Detroit, 454 F.Supp.2d 645 (E.D. Mich. 2006) (Gadola, J).\nAs in the instant case, Chancellor alleged violations of the Fourth Amendment to the\nU.S. Constitution under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and state law claims, including false arrest and\nimprisonment, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.  The Magistrate Judge’s legal\nanalysis for summary judgment purposes was adopted by this Court.  A fair reading of the\nReport and Recommendation of Magistrate Judge R. Steven Whalen in Chancellor,2  leads\nto the inescapable conclusion that the state law claims did not expand the scope of the\ncase beyond the federal claims.  Rather, the same nucleus of facts that the Court analyzed\nfor the federal constitutional claims in Chancellor, were the same facts upon which the\nCourt decided the state claims.  Such is the case here.         \n2 Magistrate Judge R. Steven Whalen is also assigned to the instant case.\n-8-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-11107-SJM-MJH   Document 17    Filed 04/19/07   Page 9 of 11\nB. Judicial Economy, Convenience, and Fairness to the Litigants\nWould be Served by Maintaining One Action in this Court\nThe nature and scope of this particular civil rights case are such that considerations\nof judicial economy, convenience and fairness to the litigants substantially favor the\nexercise of supplemental jurisdiction.  This putative class action has been brought against\ntwo governmental entities and their respective officials and employees.  There are forty-five\n(45) named Defendants.  The Plaintiffs are forty-one (41) individuals who live in various\nparts of the country.  As of this date, there are eighty-six (86) litigants. In addition, there are\napproximately fifty-three (53) absent putative class members of a class of ninety-four (94)\nindividuals on whose behalf this suit was initiated.  Presently, there are thirteen (13)\nattorneys of record, nine (9) attorneys representing the Plaintiffs with the ACLU, and the\nremainder representing the Defendants.  \nThus, in total, there could be 139 litigants and 13 attorneys involved in prosecuting\nand defending this action in the coming months following class certification. \nIn declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction, the Court has placed the parties\nin the position of having to conduct parallel class action litigation in the federal and state\ncourts.  Two courts would be utilizing limited judicial resources on the same case.  The\nDefendant governmental entities – the City of Flint and Genesee County -- and officials\nand employees who work for the City and County, would spend twice as much time away\nfrom governmental activities to participate in duplicate litigation.  Plaintiffs, who are\ngeographically dispersed across the United States and overseas, would unfairly suffer\neconomic hardship traveling to and from Michigan for parallel court proceedings, discovery\ndepositions, and trials.   In addition, parallel litigation would involve double sets of discovery\n-9-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-11107-SJM-MJH   Document 17    Filed 04/19/07   Page 10 of 11\nrequests and responses, requests to admit, depositions, records subpoenas, as well as\ncourt appearances and filings. \nEven if the parties agreed to conduct joint discovery for both proceedings, parallel\nlitigation of this magnitude would still impose extraordinary burdens of expense and\ninconvenience to the parties.  The differences in the federal and state rules of civil\nprocedure would require the litigants to prepare duplicate sets of pleadings in accordance\nwith these rules relative to discovery, motion practice, and class certification.  In state\ncourt, the parties would be required to participate in mandatory case evaluation, and be\nsubject to separate scheduling orders.  Legal arguments would likely be made by either or\nboth sides relative to res judicata and claims preclusion, depending upon which Court\nissued  the  first  ruling  on  a  question  of  law  or  fact.    In  short,  both  parties  would\nunnecessarily incur significantly higher litigation costs and burdens by having to prosecute\nand defend these claims in two different forums.3   \nC. Separate Forums Increase the Risk of Inconsistent Decisions\nCreating Conflicting Standards for Law Enforcement Agencies\nPlaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief, in addition to money damages.\nShould this Court grant the requested relief and declare certain conduct unlawful or\nunreasonable, and a state court rules to the contrary, the Defendants would be faced with\nconflicting directives and inconsistent orders.  This is not a desirable outcome for the\nparties, nor is it in the best interest of the public-at-large.  Though the parties would expect\nrulings on the same issues to be consistent, the potential nonetheless exists for conflicting\nopinions if the case is bifurcated into parallel proceedings in the federal and state courts.\n3 Plaintiffs’ costs are being borne by the American Civil Liberties Union Fund of Michigan\n(ACLU), a non-profit organization.  The Defendants are governmental entities, public officials and\nemployees, whose costs presumably are borne ultimately by taxpayers. \n-10-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-11107-SJM-MJH   Document 17    Filed 04/19/07   Page 11 of 11\nThe public policy implications of conflicting orders strongly favor maintaining this particular\ncase as one action in this Court.  Plaintiffs and Defendants both concur in the relief sought\nin this Motion for the reasons so stated.      \nIII.   CONCLUSION\nAccordingly, the parties request that the Court reconsider its April 6, 2007 Order\nof Partial Dismissal Without Prejudice and reinstate Counts III through VII. \nRespectfully submitted,\nPITT MCGEHEE PALMER RIVERS & GOLDEN\nBy: s/ Maureen M.

NATURE OF ACTION\n1. This civil rights action arises from the unlawful warrantless arrest of Plaintiffs at an\nelectronic music event held at a licensed Flint nightclub on March 20, 2005.  Plaintiffs were,\nwithout probable cause, handcuffed, patted down, strip-searched (and in some cases, body cavity\nsearched), seized of their personal possessions, verbally abused, physically assaulted and ticketed\nfor a misdemeanor, Frequenting a Disorderly House under Section 31-11(e) of a Flint City\nOrdinance.  On October 13, 2006, the Genesee County Circuit Court ruled there was no probable\ncause for the Plaintiffs’ arrests, and on January 9, 2007, the charges were dismissed with prejudice.\n2. Plaintiffs bring this action to vindicate individual constitutional and statutory rights\nwhich were blatantly violated by Defendants, acting under color of state law in concert with one\nanother, in reckless and deliberate disregard of fundamental rights and freedoms guaranteed all\nlaw-abiding citizens of the United States.  \n3. Plaintiffs seek monetary, compensatory and punitive damages, injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, for deprivation of their Fourth Amendment rights\n-2-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-11107-SJM-MJH   Document 38    Filed 07/08/08   Page 3 of 63\nto be free from unreasonable search and seizure and their First Amendment rights to free speech,\nassociation and assembly.  They also seek relief for false arrest and imprisonment, assault and\nbattery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and for violation of Michigan statutes, M.C.L.\n§ 764.25a and § 764.25b, prohibiting warrantless strip searches and body cavity searches\nconducted in the manner alleged below.  \n  II.   JURISDICTION AND VENUE\n4. This Court has original subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal\nquestion); 28 U.S.C. § 1343 (original jurisdiction over civil rights claims); and 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and\n2202 (declaratory relief).  \n5. This Court has supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1367 because Plaintiffs’\nstate law claims form part of the same case or controversy as Plaintiffs’ § 1983 claims over which\nthis Court has original subject matter jurisdiction.  \n6. Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because the events or omissions giving\nrise to the claims occurred in this District. \nIII.    DESCRIPTION OF THE PARTIES\n7. Plaintiffs are citizens and domiciliaries of the United States who attended an\nelectronic music event on March 20, 2005, at Club What’s Next, a licensed nightclub in Flint,\nMichigan. \n8.

For  purposes  of  this  Complaint,  “Defendant  officer”  refers  to  one  or  more\n(“Defendant officers”) individuals named above in paragraphs 12, 13 and 14.  \nIV.   GENERAL ALLEGATIONS\n16. Club What’s Next (“the Club”) is a licensed nightclub located at 2511 W. Pasadena\nAvenue in Flint, Michigan.  In March 2005, the Club had been in business for over ten (10) years\nand was open to members of the public. \n17.  In March 2005, the Club was available for rental by private companies sponsoring\nmusic events.  These companies promoted the events and hired deejays to provide the featured\nentertainment.   \n18. On March 19, 2005, Jell-Oh Productions had rented Club What’s Next to hold an\nelectronic music event open to the public. \n19. Electronic music encompasses a broad set of percussive music genres originating\nfrom the 1970’s disco music and contemporary pop music.  The music is created and performed\nby a deejay through an artistic manipulation of various electronic instruments such as synthesizers,\ndrum machines, and sequencers.  Electronic music events feature performance artists, dancing,\nand use of visual stimuli such as light shows. \n20. On March 19, 2005, Plaintiffs went to Club What’s Next to listen to, perform, dance\nto and/or watch deejays perform electronic music and to associate with people interested in\nelectronic music.\n21. Sometime in January of 2005, according to Flint Police Department (“FPD”) records,\nDefendant Sergeant William Meyer of the FPD Special Operations Bureau learned of the music\n-5-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-11107-SJM-MJH   Document 38    Filed 07/08/08   Page 6 of 63\nevent from reading an internet message board he happened upon while investigating so-called\n\"rave parties.\"  \n22. Defendant Meyer informed Defendant Lieutenant Phillip Smith in January of 2005\nthat an alleged “rave party” was going to be held at Club What’s Next on March 19, 2005.  It was\ndecided that Meyer would send undercover officers into the Club that night to attempt purchases\nof “Rave party type of drugs.” \n23. During the first week of March 2005, according to FPD records, Defendant Meyer\nand Defendant Captain Chris Swanson of the Genesee County Sheriff’s Department (“GCSD”)\nagreed that the GCSD would assist the FPD in its activities in relation to the alleged “rave party”\nat the Club.\n24. On the night of the event, Defendant Meyer held a briefing with Defendant officers\nfrom the FPD and GCSD.  During the briefing, according to FPD records, “[o]fficers were advised\nthat if the undercover agents purchase drugs and drugs were being sold and used openly, all\nsubjects in the bar would be placed under arrest for Frequenting a Drug House, when the officers\nentered.”  (emphasis added).  \n25. Shortly after midnight on March 20, 2005, according to FPD records, three civilian\nagents and two undercover FPD officers entered the Club to attempt to purchase illegal drugs.  \n26. The undercover officers and/or agents approached some of the Plaintiffs attempting\nto make drug buys, but the Plaintiffs turned them away.  These unsuccessful attempts put\nDefendants on notice that there were persons in the Club who were not in possession of, or\ninvolved in selling, illegal drugs.\n27. At the time, there were about 120 attendees in the Club. \n-6-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-11107-SJM-MJH   Document 38    Filed 07/08/08   Page 7 of 63\n28. Four attendees, none of whom is a Plaintiff in this action, allegedly sold drugs to\nundercover agents and officers. \n29. The undercover agents or officers notified Defendant Meyer of the alleged drug\nbuys at about 1:40 a.m., at which time, Meyer advised all Defendant officers waiting outside to\nenter and arrest everyone in the Club.  \n30. Plaintiffs, at the time, were listening to the music, performing, dancing,  enjoying\nthe entertainment and/or engaging in other innocent lawful and constitutionally-protected\nactivity, when Defendant officers stormed into the Club, yelling profanities, and announcing that\neveryone was under arrest, and shoving, pushing, grabbing, and ordering everyone to stand face\nfirst against the walls  and “shut the fuck up.” \n31. Plaintiffs were arrested based on their mere presence in the Club.   \n32. At the time of each individual Plaintiff’s arrest, Defendants did not know the\nfollowing about each individual Plaintiff:\na. When the Plaintiff originally entered the Club;\nb. How long the Plaintiff had been in the Club;\nc. Where the Plaintiff had been in the Club before police arrived;\nd. Individuals with whom the Plaintiff associated while inside the Club;\ne. Whether the Plaintiff had ever been to the Club before;\nf. Whether the Plaintiff was aware of any drug activity;\ng. Whether the Plaintiff could recognize the smell of marijuana;\nh. Whether the Plaintiff could identify a substance as Ecstasy; or\ni. Whether the Plaintiff could recognize drug paraphernalia.\n-7-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-11107-SJM-MJH   Document 38    Filed 07/08/08   Page 8 of 63\n33. Defendant officers nevertheless seized the Plaintiffs, bound their hands behind their\nbacks with handcuffs (or “zipties”), patted them down, searched wallets and cigarette packs\nretrieved from pants pockets and/or purses, and confiscated their personal identifications.\n34. While Plaintiffs stood facing the wall handcuffed, not knowing what was happening\nor why, Defendant officers began calling out their names one-by-one.  \n35.

(e) One in which controlled substances are\ndelivered,  used,  sold  or  maintained.    Controlled  Substances,  for  the\npurposes of this section, shall have the same meaning as, and shall include\nthe same substances as, the State controlled substances statute, being\nMCLA §333.7171 et seq...\n367. On October 13, 2006, the Genesee County Circuit Court Judge Joseph A. Farah held\nthat there was no probable cause for the arrest of any of the ninety-four attendees, including\nPlaintiffs.  City of Flint v. Andrea Doyle, Genesee Circuit Court Case No. 05-82575-AR. \n368. In finding no probable cause, the Court opined:\nAny finding to the contrary is undermined by the stipulated (or otherwise)\nevidence that police could offer no evidence particular to any single\ndefendant as to their arrival or departure time, their precise location in the\n-47-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-11107-SJM-MJH   Document 38    Filed 07/08/08   Page 48 of 63\nclub, their awareness of any particular transaction, or their knowledge of\nthe transaction’s significance.  To allow to stand the arrests of these 94\nDefendants would be to allow lumping together people who had been at\nthe Club for five minutes or five hours, people who never stopped dancing\nwith those who sat next to a drug deal, people who sat at a table facing the\nwall with those in the middle of mischief, and charge those dissimilarly\npresent individuals with equal awareness and knowledge of wrongdoing.”\nOpinion and Order on Remand, p. 5.\n369. Defendant City of Flint did not appeal this ruling.\n370. On January 9, 2007, all criminal charges against Plaintiffs were dismissed with\nprejudice by Judge Ramona M. Roberts of the 68th District Court on the Genesee County Circuit\nCourt’s remand order.\n371. At the time of these arrests, it was clearly established under the Fourth Amendment\nto  the  United States  Constitution,  made  applicable  to  the  states  through  the  Fourteenth\nAmendment, that the search or  seizure of one suspect cannot be bootstrapped into probable\ncause for a broad-based search or seizure of any other person, and that police officers must have\nparticularized probable cause with respect to each person searched and/or seized.  Ybarra v.\nIllinois, 444 U.S. 85 (1979).  \n372. In light of these clearly established rights, no reasonable official in the Defendants’\ncircumstances could have believed that his or her actions were reasonable and constitutionally\npermissible with respect to the searches and seizures of  the Plaintiffs.\nCOUNT I\nVIOLATION OF 42 U.S.C. § 1983\nUNREASONABLE SEARCH AND SEIZURE\nUNDER THE FOURTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS \nTO THE U.S. CONSTITUTION\n(AS TO ALL DEFENDANTS)\n373.
