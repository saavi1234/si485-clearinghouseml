      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN \nJOAN BZDA WKA, et aI., \nPlaintiffs, \nv.  Case No. 04-C-0193 \nMILWAUKEE COUNTY, et a1., \nDefendants. \nSTATE DEFENDANTS' PROPOSED FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS \nOF LAW REGARDING THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \nDefendants Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services (\"DHFS\") and DHFS \nSecretary Kevin  Hayden  (together with DHFS,  the  \"State  Defendants\"),  by their attorneys, \nJ .B. Van  Hollen,  Attorney  General,  and  Maureen  McGlynn  Flanagan,  Mary  E.  Burke,  and \nDavid Dudley, Assistant Attorneys General, respectfully submit the following proposed findings \nof fact and conclusions of law regarding the proposed Settlement Agreement which the parties \njointly have requested the Court to approve. \nFINDINGS OF FACT \nProcedural Background \n1.  This  action  was  originally  filed  in  Milwaukee  County  Circuit  Court  in \nJanuary 2004, sub nom. Gerald N. and Joan B. v. Milwaukee County, Case No. 04-CV-0862.  On \nthe motion of Milwaukee County (the \"County Defendants\"), the action was removed to the \nU.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin pursuant to 28 U.S.c. § 1441, where the \ncase was  filed  on February 25,  2004 (R.  1).  The original complaint sought declaratory and \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 09/26/07   Page 1 of 30   Document 173 \n\ninjunctive relief against Milwaukee County as the sole defendant asserting claims based on Wis. \nStat.  § 51.61, the Wisconsin Patient Rights law; 41  U.S.c.  §  1983  and the Equal Protection \nClause of the U.S. Constitution; the Equal Protection Clause of the Wisconsin Constitution; the \nAmericans  with  Disabilities  Act  (\"ADA\"),  42  U.S.c.  §  12101,  et seq.,  and  §  504  of the \nRehabilitation Act (\"Rehabilitation Act\"), 29 U.S.c. § 794. \n2.  Following preliminary proceedings and the filing of a First Amended Complaint \nand the County Defendants' Answer, the plaintiffs (\"Plaintiffs\") were pennitted to file a Second \nAmended  Complaint  on  April  30,  2004,  adding  additional  plaintiffs  and  two  additional \ndefendants,  the  Wisconsin  Department  of Health  and  Family  Services  (\"DHFS\")  and  the \nSecretary of DHFS in her official capacity (together with DHFS, the \"State Defendants,\" and \ncollectively with DHFS and the County Defendants, \"Defendants\"), so that the case was then \ncaptioned Gerald Nelson. Joan Bzdawka. et at. v.  Milwaukee County.  Wisconsin Department of \nHealth and FamiZv Services and Helene Nelson  in her official capacity as Secreta!Y of DHFS \nI \n(R. 23).  The Second Amended Complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief based on eight \nclaims alleging violations of the ADA (Counts 1, 2, and 3), the Rehabilitation Act (Counts 4, 5, \nand 6), civil rights claims under 42 U.S.c. § 1983 and the First and Fourteenth Amendments to \nthe U.S. Constitution (Count 7); and the Wisconsin Patients' Rights statute (Count 8) (R. 23). \nBoth the County Defendants and the State Defendants answered, asserting grounds for dismissal \nand various defenses, but without filing or briefing separate motions to dismiss (R. 27, 31). \nIHelene Nelson has since been succeeded as DHFS Secretary by Kevin Hayden and he, in turn, \nhas been substituted as a party defendant (R. 143, 147). \n- 2 -\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 09/26/07   Page 2 of 30   Document 173 \n\n3.  In August 2004, the Plaintiffs were pennitted to file a Third Amended Complaint \nadding additional named plaintiffs and a ninth claim for relief based on § 1983 and 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396, et seq., the federal Medical Assistance (\"MA\" or \"Medicaid\") statute, Title XIX of the \nSocial Security Act (R.  37).  The parties concurrently engaged in substantial initial discovery \nfocusing on adequacy of the state and county Family Care rates, policies, and procedures during \nthe  years  immediately prior to the  filing of the  original complaint through 2004.  Plaintiffs \ndeposed two employees of the County Defendants.  Interrogatories promulgated by the State \nDefendants were  answered  by the  Plaintiffs.  Document  requests  promulgated  by the  State \nDefendants were answered by the Plaintiffs; document requests promulgated by the Plaintiffs \nwere answered by the State Defendants and the County Defendants (Affidavit of Mary E. Burke, \n~~ 7-10; Affidavit of Patricia Chiazor, ~~ 4-7).  The County Defendants also allowed Plaintiffs' \nexperts to  access all  Family Care Community Based Residential Facility (\"CBRF\") provider \nfiles,  including audited financial  statements, at the Milwaukee County Department on Aging \n(\"MCDA\") office (ef R.  120:2-3).  The initial discovery on these subjects was updated and \nexpanded periodically as this lawsuit proceeded (Affidavit of Mary E. Burke, ~~ 7-11; Affidavit \nof Patricia Chiazor, ~~ 4-6, 8). \n4.  Following efforts by the parties to reach a stipUlation identifying what matters \nwere in dispute as required by the Amended Scheduling Order of the Court filed January 31, \n2005 (see R. 46, 50), the Plaintiffs moved for pennission to file a Fourth Amended Complaint \n(R. 51).  Plaintiffs justified the motion on grounds that transactions and events that had taken \nplace since the filing of the Third Amended Complaint needed to be included in the action, and \nbecause the Plaintiffs wished to clarify claims alleged in that complaint in order to avoid the \nDefendants' objections that certain matters were not fairly within the scope of the litigation (id.). \n- 3 -\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 09/26/07   Page 3 of 30   Document 173 \n\nThe Defendants  subsequently stipulated to  the  filing of the Fourth Amended Complaint, the \naddition of other named plaintiffs, and the amendment of the caption, based on the Plaintiffs' \nassurances  that  they  would  seek  no  further  substantive  changes  to  the  complaint,  and  the \nDefendants' stated intent vigorously to oppose any additional substantive amendments (R. 58). \nIn granting the Plaintiffs'  motion  for permission to  file  the Fourth Amended Complaint, the \nCourt also denied without prejudice the Plaintiffs' Motion to Certify a Class (R. 60). \n5.  Like  its  immediate  predecessor  complaint,  the  Fourth  Amended  Complaint \nasserted  four pairs of claims seeking declaratory,  injunctive,  and retroactive monetary relief \nbased, respectively, on the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act; and a statutory civil rights claim, \n42 U.S.C.  §  1983,  based  on  a  provision  of  the  federal  Medicaid  statute,  42  U.S.C. \n§ 1396a(a)(30)(A) (\"(a)(30)(A)\") (see R. 51, Att. 1).  The named plaintiffs and their guardians or \nauthorized  representatives  claim  that  their  rights  under  the  ADA,  Rehabilitation  Act,  and \n(a)(30)(A) are being violated by the manner in which DHFS and Milwaukee County administer \nFamily  Care,  a  statutory  Wisconsin  MA  waiver program  designed  to  serve  physically and \ndevelopmentally disabled persons and the elderly (id.). \n6.  Family Care is a managed care MA waiver program currently operated by DHFS \nas a pilot program in a limited number of counties including Milwaukee, through which elderly \npersons with long-term care needs and adults who have physical or developmental disabilities \nmay receive comprehensive community-based services (see R. 71:3 n.l (citations omitted*2); see \nalso id. at 4, n.5*).  Services available under Family Care include both some of the services that \nwould otherwise be provided under Wisconsin's regular State Medicaid Plan, as well as services \n2\"*,, indicates full citation is available at indicated page of the record. \n-4 -\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 09/26/07   Page 4 of 30   Document 173 \n\nthat would otherwise be available only under a Home and Community-Based Services (\"HCBS\") \nWaiver obtained  from  the  federal  government  under  §  1915( c)  of the  Social  Security Act, \n42 U.S.c. § I 396n(c) (id. at 3, n.2*). \n7.  Family Care is authorized by federal Medicaid authorities pursuant to two types of \nwaivers, and an approved prepaid health plan that authorizes DHFS to contract for State Plan \nlong-term care services on a prepaid basis (R.71  no.3, 4*).  The waivers permit Wisconsin to \ndeliver services in a manner that is exempt from some otherwise-applicable federal Medicaid \nrequirements.  One type of waiver, the HCBS or \"1915(c)\" waiver, permits Wisconsin to use \nfederal Medicaid funds  for HCBS  services instead of only institutional care for people who \nwould qualify for Medicaid in a nursing home.  See 42 U.S.c. § 1396n(c).  The other type of \nwaiver, the managed care or \"1915(b)\" waiver, permits Wisconsin to limit the services in the \nFamily Care benefit to people who enroll in a care management organization (\"CMO\").  This \nwaiver also  limits  participants'  freedom  of choice  of provider.  See  42  U.S.C.  §  1396n(b) \n(\"Waivers to promote cost-effectiveness and efficiency\").  Family Care is designed to provide \nlong-term community-based managed care to covered individuals who choose to enroll in the \ncounty CMO.  See Wis. Stat. § 46.284. \n8.  In  Milwaukee  County,  Family  Care  is  available  only  for  elderly  individuals \n(60 years  of age  and older)  with physical  disabilities,  as  well  as  those  with  developmental \ndisabilities.  In other counties in  which Family Care is operating,  it  is  available  for elderly \nindividuals and adults of any age with physical or developmental disabilities (R. 71 :4-5, n.6*). \nIn Milwaukee  County,  physically or developmentally disabled  persons  under the  age  of 60 \ncontinue to receive community-based long term care services via pre-existing HCBS waivers, \n- 5 -\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 09/26/07   Page 5 of 30   Document 173 \n\nincluding the Community Options Program (\"COP\") waiver, Community Integration Program \n(\"CIP\") and Brain Injury (\"Br') waivers (R.71 :5*). \n9.  Features of the Family Care program that distinguish it from the state Medicaid \nplan itself and from the traditional HCBS waiver programs include the following: \na)  Wisconsin Medicaid pays Family Care CMOs on a capitated \"per member \nper month\" basis rather than a \"fee-for-service\" basis. Under both the State \nPlan  and  traditional  HCBS  Waivers,  providers  are  usually  paid  on  a \nfee-for-service  basis:  the  provider  renders  a  service  to  a  Medicaid \nrecipient. submits a claim to Medicaid, and is paid at a pre-established rate \nfor  the  service.  In  contrast,  under Family Care,  the  CMO  agrees  by \ncontract with the State Medicaid Program to provide the services from the \nFamily  Care  benefit  package  that  meet  most  cost-effectively  each \nparticipant's assessed long-term care needs, in exchange for a capitated, \nper member-per month payment from the State Medicaid Program.  Wis. \nStat. § 46.28(4)(d) and (5) (see R. 71:6-7, n.12*). \nb)  Under  applicable  federal  regulations,  DHFS  is  required  to  set  these \ncapitated payment rates at a level that is \"actuarially sound,\" subject to \nannual review and approval by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices  (\"CMS\").  See  42  C.F.R.  §§  438.1 (a)(l)  and  438.6(c)(2). \n\"Actuarially sound\" refers to  the federal  requirement that  the capitated \nrates must be developed and independently certified as appropriate for the \npopulations  covered  and  for  the  services  to  be  furnished  under  the \ncontract, and as providing for all reasonable, appropriate, and attainable \n- 6 -\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 09/26/07   Page 6 of 30   Document 173 \n\ncosts.  See 42 C.F.R. § 438.6(c)(l )-(3).  The Family Care capitated rates \nare developed by an actuarial firm under contract with DHFS (R.  71 :7, \nn.14*). \nc)  Family Care  is  a Medicaid entitlement program.  Unlike other HCBS \nwaiver programs (COP, CIP,  and BI),  an  individual who is eligible for \nMedicaid, and is functionally eligible for Family Care, may not be placed \non a waiting list to await either participation in the program or receipt of \nany part of the services for which the individual has an assessed need. \nWis. Stat.  § 46.286(3)(a).  A Family Care CMO is required to provide \ncost-effectively all  services necessary to  meet the participant's assessed \nneeds, in exchange for the monthly capitated payment for that individual \n(see R. 71 :3,8 nn.2, 15*). \nd)  Unlike  provider  reimbursement  under  the  traditional  HCBS  WaIver \nprograms,  DHFS,  as  the  state  Medicaid  agency,  does  not make direct \npayments  to  the providers who  render Family Care  services.  Instead, \nDHFS  pays  the  respective  CMO the  capitated rate  based  on  the  total \nnumber of Family Care enrollees the CMO serves per month.  The Family \nCare CMO pays its providers, and is responsible for setting payment rates, \nat a level that will attract a sufficient number of qualified providers to \nprovide services to all entitled persons who seek enrollment in the CMO \n(R. 71:3,8 nn.2, 16*). \n10.  The  primary  focus  of Plaintiffs'  claims  set  forth  in  the  Fourth  Amended \nComplaint is the allegedly inadequate capitated rates paid by the State to the MCDA which is the \n- 7 -\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 09/26/07   Page 7 of 30   Document 173 \n\nCMO for Milwaukee County (the \"MCDA CMO\"), and the allegedly inadequate contracted rates \nthat the MCDA CMO pays to providers of certain residential and day program services who \nserve Plaintiffs and the class they represent.  According to the Fourth Amended Complaint, the \nallegedly inadequate state capitated rates and, in tum, the contracted rates the MCDA CMO pays \nto providers of services by CBRFs, adult family homes (\"AFHs\"), and adult daycare programs \nviolate the ADA and Rehabilitation Act by:  discriminating against persons with disabilities; \nproviding services and using methods of administration that subject persons with disabilities to \ndiscrimination; violating the mandate of those statutes that services be administered in the most \nintegrated setting; and violating the \"reasonable modification\" requirements of those statutes and \nrelated  federal  regulations;  and,  in  addition,  violate (a)(30)(A)  of the Medicaid Act as  well \n(R. 51, Att. 1). \n11.  The County and State Defendants each answered the Fourth Amended Complaint \nin May 2005, and then, pursuant to a briefing schedule ordered by the Court, filed their respective \nbriefs  in  support of the State Defendants'  Motions to  Dismiss  and  the County Defendants' \nMotion for Judgment on the Pleadings (R. 60, 63, 64, 68-69, 70-71).  The Defendants vigorously \nargued  that  some of Plaintiffs' claims should be dismissed because the  individual plaintiffs \nlacked standing or because the claims were not ripe for adjudication, and that all nine claims \nfailed  to  state claims on which relief could be  granted (R.  69,  71).  In  addition,  the State \nDefendants argued that Plaintiffs' claim for retroactive monetary and declaratory relief against \nthem under either the ADA or (a)(30)(A) must be dismissed on grounds of sovereign immunity \nand the Eleventh Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (R. 71). \n12.  On  February  7,  2006,  the  Court  issued  an  interlocutory  Decision  and  Order \npartially granting some of Defendants'  motions,  agreeing that Plaintiffs had  alleged  no past \n- 8 -\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 09/26/07   Page 8 of 30   Document 173 \n\nInJunes  to  themselves,  and  therefore  lacked  standing  to  pursue  retroactive  monetary  and \ndeclaratory  relief.  The  Court  also  limited  Plaintiffs'  discrimination  claims  to  forms  of \ndiscrimination  based  on  the  ADA  or  Rehabilitation  Act,  eliminating  allegations  of age \ndiscrimination or discrimination based on county of residency (see gen., R. 86). \n13.  The Court denied the Defendants' remaining motions to dismiss or for judgment \non the pleadings, concluding that Plaintiffs have standing to seek prospective relief based on the \nalleged inadequacy of the capitated rates paid by DHFS to the MCDA CMO and, in tum, the \nrates the MCDA CMO is willing to pay Plaintiffs' providers.  In addition, the Court concluded \nthat all eight claims based on the ADA and Rehabilitation Act survived, either entirely or in part, \nthe Defendants'  motions for dismissal alleging the failure to state claims that relief could be \ngranted, Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) and 12(c).  Finally, the Court concluded that § (a)(30)(A) of the \nMedicaid Act creates a private right of action enforceable under the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.c. \n§ 1983 (see gen., R. 86). \n14.  On February 23, 2006, the State Defendants filed a motion seeking certification of \nthe Court's February 7,2006, Order for interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) on \ntwo grounds, arguing that the issues of whether Plaintiffs' claims are sufficiently ripe to confer \nstanding, and whether there is a private right of action under (a)(30)(A), met the criteria required \nfor an immediate interlocutory appeal (R. 93). \n15.  On March 1,2006, the parties filed a stipulation agreeing to dismiss the Medicaid \nclaim based on (a)(30)(A).  They also stipulated to dismissal of the lead plaintiff, Gerald Nelson, \nwho had passed away on February 6, 2006, thereby leaving Joan Bzdawka, the other original \nplaintiff, as lead plaintiff (R. 96). \n- 9 -\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 09/26/07   Page 9 of 30   Document 173 \n\n16.  On March 1, 2006, Plaintiffs, appearing by additional counsel on behalf of the \nputative class, filed their Renewed Motion for Class Certification pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23, \nseeking  an  order  certifying  a  class  composed  of  H[ a]ll  Milwaukee  County  residents  with \ndisabilities who are now or will in the future be:  (1) eligible for the Family Care program, and \n(2)  appropriate,  based on reasonable professional judgment,  for  residential services  in  adult \nfamily homes and community-based residential facilities\" (R. 101: 1;  see also R. 97). \n17.  On April 6, 2006, the Court denied the State Defendants' motion for certification \nof an interlocutory appeal on the remaining issue of standing set forth in the motion (R. 106). \n18.  On May 26, 2006, the State Defendants filed their response brief opposing the \nrenewed  motion  for  class  certification,  together  with  supporting  affidavits  (R.  114-17).  In \nopposing the renewed motion, the State Defendants challenged Plaintiffs' claim that they had \nsuccessfully established the requirements for certification of the proposed class and argued, in \naddition, that the declaratory and injunctive relief sought with respect to the putative class as a \nwhole would not be appropriate under governing precedent (see gen., R. 114). \n19.  On October 13, 2006, the Court issued its Decision and Order concluding that \nclass certification under Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  23(b )(2)  is  appropriate,  thereby granting Plaintiffs' \nmotion, and certifying a class \"consisting of disabled Milwaukee County residents who are now \nor will in the future be eligible to reside in a Family Care AFH or CBRF\" (R. 125: 10 ). \n20.  In preparation for the scheduling conference required by Fed~ R. Civ. P. l6(b), the \nparties  reached  stipulations  concerning  the  nature of remaining  claims,  defenses,  and  relief \nsought; the scope of anticipated discovery to prepare for trial; and the usefulness of exploring \nsettlement of the litigation through an alternate dispute resolution process (R. 127). \n- 1O-\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 09/26/07   Page 10 of 30   Document 173 \n\n21.  With  regard  to  the  remaining claims and defenses, the parties agreed  that  the \nplaintiff class alleges, in general, that the capitated rates paid by DHFS to the MCDA CMO for \neach Family Care enrollee are insufficient and that the rates paid, in turn by the MCDA CMO to \nAFHs,  CBRFs,  and  day  programs  for  Milwaukee  County  Family  Care  enrollees  are  also \ninsufficient (R.  127:2, ~ 2).  With one exception identified in (a) below, the parties agreed that \nthe remaining claims and defenses are fairly summarized as follows: \na)  Claims arising from Counts 1 and 5 (as summarized, respectively, by the \nDefendants and the Plaintiffs): \nDefendants summarize the claims as follows:  ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct claims of discrimination based on severity of disability, but not age or \ncounty of residence.  Plaintiffs allege  that Family Care recipients with \nmore severe disabilities receive substantially inferior treatment because the \nFamily  Care  program  provides  lesser  funding  for  services  in  AFHs, \nCBRFs, and related day programs for these individuals, in comparison to \nthose with less significant disabilities, so that the individuals with more \nsevere disabilities will be forced,  contrary to their wishes, to move into \nmore restrictive, less integrated settings (R. 127:2, ~ 5(a)*). \nPlaintiffs summarize the claims as follows:  ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nclaims of discrimination based on severity of disability, but not age or \ncounty of residence.  Plaintiffs allege that  Family Care recipients with \nmore severe disabilities receive substantially inferior treatment because the \nFamily  Care  program  provides  lesser  funding  for  services  in  AFHs, \nCBRFs, and related day programs for these individuals, in comparison to \n- 11 -\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 09/26/07   Page 11 of 30   Document 173 \n\nthose with  less  significant disabilities.  This substantially increases  the \nprobability that the individuals with more severe disabilities will be forced \ncontrary  to  their  wishes  to  move  into  other  AFRs,  CBRFs,  and  day \nprograms and/or more restrictive, less integrated settings (127:3, ~ 5(a)*). \nb)  Claims  arising  from  Counts  2  and  6:  Claims  under  the  ADA, \nRehabilitation Act, and cited federal rules, alleging discrimination and the \nfailure reasonably to  accommodate people with disabilities by virtue of \nFamily Care policies, procedures, and rates relating to funding for AFRs, \nCBRFs, and related day programs.  Plaintiffs allege that the rates set by the \ndefendants  \"aid  or  perpetuate  discrimination  against  persons  with \ndisabilities and prevent them from obtaining the same result, gaining the \nsame  benefit  or reaching  the  same  level  of achievement  in  the  most \nintegrated setting appropriate to their needs and have the purpose or effect \nof defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of \nthe Family Care and Medicaid programs\" (127:3, ~ 5(b)*). \nc)  Claims  arising  from  Counts  3  and  7:  ADA  and  Rehabilitation  Act \nintegration claims. Plaintiffs allege that inadequate Family Care \"policies, \nprocedures and rates relating to funding for AFRs, CBRFs and [related] \nday programs\" will substantially increase the probability that members of \nthe  plaintiff class  will  be  placed  into  more  restrictive,  less  integrated \nsettings contrary to their wishes (127:3-4, ~ 5(c)*). \nd)  Claims  arising  from  Counts  4  and  8:  ADA  and  Rehabilitation  Act \nreasonable accommodation claims.  Plaintiffs allege that defendants are \n- 12 -\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 09/26/07   Page 12 of 30   Document 173 \n\nrequired to make reasonable modifications of capitated rates and methods \nused  to  determine  provider  rates,  so  as  to  make  individualized \ndetennination of the services needed to place and maintain members of the \nplaintiff class in  appropriate and  integrated residential  settings of their \nchoice (127:4, ~ 5(d)*). \n22.  The parties further agreed that the Defendants generally denied the validity of \neach  of the  claims,  and  that,  in  addition  to  other  defenses  available  under  the  ADA  and \nRehabilitation Act, the Defendants had preserved claims that requested modifications of Family \nCare program procedures, including relief in the form of increases in either the State capitated \nrates or the Milwaukee County provider rates, would constitute a \"fundamental alteration\" of the \nFamily Care managed care program.  The parties also agreed that Defendants had preserved their \nclaim that injunctive relief would be unjustified as a matter of law because the named plaintiffs \nand members of the certified class have an adequate remedy at law in the form of the right to a \nfair  hearing  concerning  any  denial,  reduction,  or  termination  of  Family  Care  benefits \n(R. 127:4-5). \n23.  Concerning the scope of anticipated discovery needed before further dispositive \nmotions or trial, the parties agreed that,  in addition to  updating responses to prior discovery \ndemands,  further  discovery  efforts  should  be  forward-looking,  consistent  with  the  Court's \nFebruary 7,  2006,  order denying  retroactive  injunctive and declaratory relief.  Thus,  further \ndiscovery and litigation would focus on the setting of the capitated rates and provider rates for \ncalendar years 2006 and 2007.  To that end, counsel agreed that subjects on which additional \ndiscovery would be needed to prepare for trial include the process by which DHFS calculates the \ncapitated rate paid to the MCDA CMO for each Family Care enrollee; the information upon \n- 13 -\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 09/26/07   Page 13 of 30   Document 173 \n\nwhich the capitated rate is calculated; the adequacy and actuarial soundness of the capitated rates; \nthe  process  by which  the  CMO calculates the  rates  paid  to  AFH,  CBRF,  and  day program \nproviders serving Milwaukee County enrollees in Family Care; the information upon which the \nprovider rates are calculated; the adequacy of the provider rates; the factual bases upon which the \nPlaintiffs' allegations about inadequacy of the capitated rates and provider rates are based; and \nexpert opinions about all of the foregoing subjects (R. 127:6). \n24.  Although the parties agreed, and the Court then ordered, that the case be referred \nto  Magistrate  Judge  Gorence  for  mediation  (R.  125:5,  ~ 11;  135),  the  Plaintiffs  and  State \nDefendants completed both the exchange of Rule 26(a)(1) initial disclosures and the updating of \nprior discovery responses before the formal mediation before Magistrate Judge Gotence began on \nFebruary 26,2007 (see R.  132; Affidavit of Mary E. Burke, ~~ 7,8,10,11; Affidavit of Patricia \n,r \nChiazor,  8). \n25.  Pursuant to  the  Order Re:  Mediation issued by Judge Gorence (R.  136), the \nparties  developed,  exchanged,  and  had  preliminary  discussions  concerning  comprehensive \nsettlement proposals developed  both  by the  Plaintiffs,  and jointly by the  State  and  County \nDefendants.  Because the interests of the State Defendants and the County Defendants, both in \nthe litigation itself and in the formula for a potential settlement, are not identical, development of \nthe Defendants' joint settlement proposal required both considerable cooperation and substantial \nmutual accommodation by the two sets of defendants as well (Affidavit of Mary E. Burke, ~ 12). \n26.  Key representatives of each of the defendant parties and counsel of record for all \nparties  and  the  class  participated  in  a day-long  mediation conducted  by Judge  Gorence  on \nFebruary 26,  2007 (R.  150).  Tom Hlavacek, an experienced and respected advocate for  the \ninterests of the plaintiff class, assisted Plaintiffs' counsel throughout the mediation (R.  150). \n- 14 -\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 09/26/07   Page 14 of 30   Document 173 \n\nAlso participating in the mediation were various client representatives for the State Defendants \nand  the  County  Defendants  (R.  150).  Client  representatives  participating  in  the  mediation \nsession for the State Defendants were DHFS Deputy Secretary Susan Reinardy, DHFS Managed \nCare Section Chief Monica Deignan, Family Care Program Manager Charles Jones, and Family \nCare Rate Setting Consultant Tom Lawless (R.  150; Affidavit of Mary E. Burke, ~ 14).  Client \nrepresentatives participating in the mediation session for the County Defendants were MCDA \nDirector Stephanie Sue Stein; MCDA Assistant Director for Long Term Care Maria Ledger (who \nserves as Director of the MCDA CMO); MCDA CMO Chief Financial Officer Jim Hodson; \nMCDA  Assistant  Director  for  Fiscal  Services  David  Hopkins;  and  MCDA  CMO  Contract \nManager James Hennen (R. 150; Affidavit of Mary E. Burke, ~ 15).  Although the parties made \nsubstantial progress in reaching agreement on a number of key issues and all agreed that further \nnegotiations were desirable, they were not able to complete their negotiations concerning the \nterms of a substantive settlement at the February 26 mediation session (Affidavit of Mary E. \nBurke, ~ 16). As a result, Judge Gorence ordered that the mediation be continued to a second \nsession scheduled for March 27,2007 (R. 149). \n27.  Prior to the scheduled March 27, 2007, mediation, the parties finalized language \nmemorializing terms of the substantive settlement agreed to  at the  February 26 session, and \ncontinued to negotiate via e-mail and telephone concerning those tenus on which agreement had \nnot been reached (Affidavit of Mary E.  Burke, ~ 17).  They were able to reach an agreement \nconcerning  all  substantive terms of the settlement agreement prior to  the  March  27  session \n(R.151). \n28.  After  reporting to  Judge  Gorence  concerning the  completion of a substantive \nagreement, the parties began a separate arms-length negotiation concerning the single remaining \n- 15 -\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 09/26/07   Page 15 of 30   Document 173 \n\nissue of attorney fees  and costs, as  ordered by Judge Gorence during a telephone conference \nconducted in lieu of the March 27 mediation (id.).  No discussion or negotiation of attorneys' \nfees or costs took place until the parties already had reached agreement on the substantive terms \nof settlement (Affidavit of Mary E. Burke, ,-r  19).  Plaintiffs' counsel provided cOW1sel for both \nsets  of Defendants  with  copies  of itemized  billing  records,  and  defense  counsel  carefully \nreviewed them before responding to the offer for settlement of an award of fees and costs initially \nrequested by Plaintiffs' counsel (Affidavit of Mary E. Burke, ,-r 20).  Further offers and counter \noffers were exchanged prior to counsel reaching a tentative agreement on the amount of attorney \nfees  and  costs  (Affidavit  of Mary  E.  Burke, ,-r  20).  That agreement was  communicated to \nJudge Gorence during a telephone conference with counsel  for  all  parties on May 25,  2007 \n(R. 155). \n29.  Although  the  State  Defendants  were  able  to  obtain  approval  of the  tentative \nsettlement  within  a  relatively short  time,  the process  for  securing  the  successive approvals \nrequired by the Committee on JUdiciary, Safety and General Services of the Milwaukee COW1ty \nBoard, and by the County Board was not completed until July 26, 2007, when the fuIl County \nBoard formally approved the terms of the settlement (R. 158). \n30.  The parties promptly reported the approval of the settlement agreement to  the \nCourt at a telephone status conference on July 31,2007 (R. 159).  As ordered by the Court, the \nparties filed their Joint Motion for Preliminary and Final Approval of the Settlement Agreement, \nand  for  an  Order  Directing  Distribution  of Notice  of Proposed  Settlement  Agreement  and \nScheduling Fairness Hearing, supporting brief, and proposed order, along with a copy of the \nSettlement Agreement signed by all  counsel, on August  14,  2007 (R.  161-63).  Pursuant to \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(e) and Armstrong v. Board o/School Dir., 616 F.2d 305,314 (7th Cir. 1980), \n- 16 -\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 09/26/07   Page 16 of 30   Document 173 \n\noverruled on other gds. by Felzen v. Andreas, 134 F.3d 873, 875 (7th Cir. 1998), the Court found \nthat the tern1S of the proposed Settlement Agreement were within the range of possible approval, \nand  that there was  good reason to  notify the class members of the proposed settlement and \nproceed with a fairness hearing (R.  165 :2).  The Court therefore issued the Order preliminarily \napproving the proposed settlement, directing distribution of notice of the proposed settlement, \nand  scheduling the  fairness  hearing required  by Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  23(e)  on August  21,  2007 \n(R. 165).  The Court also approved the contents of the Notice of Proposed Settlement Agreement \n(the \"Notice\") (R. 165:2). \nThe Proposed Settlement Agreement \n31.  The  proposed  Settlement  Agreement  consists  of  four  major  sections \n(R.161:6-13). \n32.  The  first  major  section  of the  proposed  Settlement  Agreement  is  entitled \n\"Commitments  of the  County  Defendants\"  (R.  161 :6-8).  Particular provisions,  for  which \nspecific  timeframes  and  other  details  are  set  forth  in  the  proposed  Settlement  Agreement, \ninclude: \na.  The MCDA CMO will provide care managers with continuing training and \neducation regarding when notices of intended adverse action must be sent to Family Care \nparticipants pursuant to Wis. Admin. Code § HFS 10.52(3) and the Family Care contract \n(R. 161:6). \nb.  The MCDA CMO will make reasonable efforts to support enactment of \nGovernor Doyle's proposed 2007-09 budget proposal that would provide funding for an \nindependent advocacy program for Family Care participants (R. 161 :6). \n- 17 -\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 09/26/07   Page 17 of 30   Document 173 \n\nc.  The MCDA CMO will expand its CBRF provider audit review process to \ninclude additional cost and staffing information,  and will  contractually require CBRF \nproviders to submit additional information for consideration in the audit review process \n(R.161:6-7). \nd.  The MCDA CMO will conduct bi-annual audit reviews of muItifacility, \ncorporate  providers  of 3-4  bed  AFH  services,  and  will  contractually  require  those \nproviders  to  submit  audited  financial  statements,  cost,  and  staffing  information  for \nconsideration in the audit review process (R. 161 :7). \ne.  In  cOlmection  with  quality  performance  and  provider  rate  setting,  the \nMCDA CMO will consider as a relevant factor data from provider surveys released on \nMarch 26, 2007.  The MCDA CMO will retain its current discretion to establish the rate \nsetting methodology and negotiate provider rates, subject to the superintending authority \nofDHFS (R. 161:7). \nf.  The MCDA will complete provider network adequacy reviews twice a \nyear, including needs assessments of future Family Care participants (R.  161 :7-8).  The \nMCDA CMO will disseminate the results of its provider network adequacy reviews at \nleast  once  annually to  the  development and/or land  use  planning  departments  of all \nMilwaukee County municipalities (R. 161 :8). \ng.  In  connection  with  provider  rate  setting,  MCDA  will:  (1)  provide \ncontracted CBRF,  AFH,  and day services providers the  factors  taken  into account in \ndeveloping the rates offered those providers; (2) post on its website a summary of the \nfactors taken into account in developing the rates offered those providers; and (3) initiate \n- 18 -\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 09/26/07   Page 18 of 30   Document 173 \n\na process of soliciting input from CBRF, AFH, and day services providers that will be \nconsidered in rate-setting to the extent it is relevant (R. 161: 7). \nh.  The MCDA CMO will at least once annually invite all Milwaukee County \nmunicipalities to provide input to address the issue of affordable CBRF, AFH, and other \nhousing for Milwaukee County Family Care participants (R. 161 :7-8). \nThe MCDA CMO will collaborate with the MCDA Resource Center to \n1. \nmake materials available to all nursing homes located in Milwaukee County that explain \n• \nthe alternate residential options available through the Family Care program and provide \ncontact information for the Milwaukee County Aging Resource Center (R. 161 :8). \n33.  The  second  major  section  of the  proposed  Settlement  Agreement  is  entitled \n\"Commitments of the State Defendants\" (R. 161 :8-12).  Particular provisions, for which specific \ntimeframes and other details are set forth in the proposed Settlement Agreement, include: \na.  DHFS will issue and post on its website a contract interpretation memo \nreiterating that Family Care participants may contest the choice of residential or day care \nprovider services proposed by the CMO by pursuing Family Care grievance procedures or \na fair  hearing;  and that the  standard to  be  applied  in resolving any such disputes is \nwhether the proposed plan would provide care, treatment, or supports that are insufficient \nto  meet  a  participant's  needs  or  outcomes,  or  are  provided  in  a  setting  that  is \nunnecessarily restrictive or less integrated than is appropriate to the participant's needs \n(R.  161:8-9). DHFS  will issue and post on its website a contract interpretation memo \nreiterating the importance of appropriate and adequate pre-transfer planning for Family \nCare  participants  transferring  from  one  residential  setting  to  another  (R.  161: 11). \nSimilarly, DHFS  will  issue and post on its website additional  informational materials \n- 19 -\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 09/26/07   Page 19 of 30   Document 173 \n\nexplaining the Resource Allocation Decision (\"RAD\") method used in the Family Care \nprogram to help participants identify personal outcomes (R.  161 :9).  DHFS will provide \ndrafts  of the  contract  interpretation  memos  and  the  RAD  informational  materials  to \nplaintiffs counsel and certain advocacy organizations, and will accept written comments \nbefore finalizing the documents (R.  161:8-9, 11).  DHFS will retain sole discretion to \ndetermine final content of the memos and the informational materials (R.  161 :8-9, 11). \nDHFS also will provide the final RAD informational materials to Fanlily Care grievance \nbodies  and  Division of Hearings  and  Appeals  administrative  law judges assigned  to \nconduct Family Care hearings (R. 161: 10 ). \nb.  If the  MCDA  CMO's  2008  annual  certification  application  to  DHFS \nincludes submission of any revised form  notices, before certifYing the CMO for 2008 \nDHFS will provide copies of the revised form notices to plaintiffs' counsel and certain \nadvocacy organizations (R. 161 :9-10).  DHFS will accept comments on the revised form \nnotices, but will retain sole discretion to determine whether to certify the MCDA CMO \nfor 2008 and to determine whether to require the MCDA CMO to make any changes in \nthe revised form notices (R. 161: 10 ). \nc.  The State Defendants will continue to support creation of the independent \nadvocacy  program  for  Family Care participants  for  which  Governor Doyle  included \nfunding in his 2007-09 budget proposal (R.  161: I 0).  Upon passage by the Legislature \nand inclusion of funding in the 2007-09 budget, DHFS will promptly issue a request for \nproposals and take other necessary steps to implement the program (R.  161: 10).  If the \nindependent advocacy program is established, DHFS will include in any contract or other \ndocument governing that program a requirement for semi-annual reporting of referral \n-20-\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 09/26/07   Page 20 of 30   Document 173 \n\nstatistics  (R.  161:10).  The  statistical  reports  will  be posted  on  DHFS'  Family Care \nwebsite (R. 161: 10 ). \nd.  DHFS  will  contract with  its  External  Quality Review  Organization  to \nrequire semi-annual  statistical  reporting  regarding  referrals  to  the  state's appeals  and \ngrievances  program,  referral  outcomes,  requests  for  fair  hearings,  and  fair  hearings \nconducted (R.  161: 10 ).  DHFS will post statistical reports received on its Family Care \nweb site (R. 161: 10). \ne.  DHFS  will  work  with  the  MCDA  CMO  to  enhance  openness  of the \nMCDAJprovider  rate-setting  process  by  exploring  alternate  rate  setting  methods  for \nCBRF and AFH providers (R. 161:10). \nf.  DHFS  will  provide  information  to  CBRF  and  AFH  members  of the \nMCDA CMO's provider network about  locations on DHFS'  web  site of information \nabout  the  capitated  rate  setting  process  and  the  Family  Care  actuarial  rate  reports \ndescribing development methodology (R. 161: 10 -11). \ng.  DHFS will prepare technical assistance materials and convene a meeting \nof DHFS  and  MCDA staff regarding identification and  implementation of additional \npractices to enhance planning for safe and effective residential moves for Family Care \nmembers, and pre-move assessments (R. 161: 11). \nh.  DHFS  will  conduct  a  one-time  review  of Milwaukee  County  Watts3 \nreview procedures and pursue any corrective action as determined appropriate by DHFS \n3State ex rei. Watts v. Combined Comm. Svcs., 122 Wis. 2d 65, 362 N.W.2d 104 (1985). \n- 21 -\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 09/26/07   Page 21 of 30   Document 173 \n\nin  its sole discretion (R.  161: 11).  DHFS  will provide copies of the final  report,  any \ncorrective action plan, and any compliance reports to plaintiffs' counsel (R. 161: 11-12). \n1.  DHFS  will  amend  the  DHFS/MCDA Family Care  contract  to  include \nlanguage that  MCDA will provide services in  the most integrated level of residential \nsetting  consistent  with  the  desired  outcomes,  preferences,  and  identified  needs  of a \nparticipant, and that is cost-effective when compared to alternate services that could meet \nthe same needs and achieve similar outcomes (R. 161: 12). \nJ.  DHFS will direct its External Quality Review Organization to include in \nthe care plan review process consideration of whether a Family Care participant would be \nmore appropriately placed in a less restrictive/more integrated residence and whether the \nindividual would prefer to move to a less restrictive/more integrated facility (R. 161: 12). \n34.  The  third  major  section  of the  proposed  Settlement  Agreement  is  entitled \n\"Enforcement\"  (R.  161:  12-13).  If plaintiffs  believe  in  good  faith  that  either  the  County \nDefendants or the State Defendants are out of compliance with any provision of the Settlement \nAgreement,  plaintiffs  must notify all  Defendants  and  attempt  to  negotiate  an  agreement  to \naddress the alleged deficiency (R. 161:12).  If the parties are unable to reach an agreement, the \nplaintiffs may file a remedial motion with the Court (R. 161: 12). \n35.  The  fourth  major  section  of the  proposed  Settlement  Agreement  is  entitled \n\"Miscellaneous\" (R. 161:13).  The parties agree that Family Care participants who enter CBRFs \nand  AFHs  should  not  automatically be disqualified  from  participating  in day programming \nservices outside their residences (R.  161: 13).  The parties agree that it is appropriate to use the \nRAD to determine whether the outcomes of Family Care participants who reside in CBRFs and \nAFHs cannot be met without access to outside day programming services (R.  161: 13).  Except \n- 22 -\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 09/26/07   Page 22 of 30   Document 173 \n\nfor provisions of the Settlement Agreement for which some other compliance date or time period \nis specified, provisions of the Settlement Agreement will terminate and cease to be enforceable \ntwo years after the date of the Court's order approving the Settlement Agreement (R. 161:13). \nPlaintiffs' counsel will receive $130,000.00 in full settlement of their claim for attorneys fees and \ncosts in connection with their representation of the plaintiffs in this lawsuit (R. 161: 13). \nDistribution of Notice of Proposed Settlement Agreement \n36.  The Notice approved by the Court was sent by First Class U.S. Mail on or about \nSeptember 11,2007, to each person included as of September 5, 2007, in the MCDA database of \nall current Milwaukee County Family Care members,  legal guardians  for those  Family Care \nmembers, and persons serving as agents under activated powers of attorney for those Family Care \nmembers (Affidavit of James Hennen, ~~ 3-7). \n37.  A copy of the Notice was provided to each person, and/or the legal guardian or \nperson holding activated powers of attorney for each such person, who enrolled in Milwaukee \nCounty  Family  Care  between  September  6,  2007,  and  October  16,  2007  (Affidavit  of \nJames Hennen, 18, and other submissions of the County Defendants). \n38.  On  September  10,  2007,  copies  of the  Notice  and  the  Proposed  Settlement \nAgreement  were  posted  on  the  DHFS  website  at  http://wwvv.dhjs.slate.wi.us/LTCare  and \nremained posted through the close of business October 19, 2007 (Affidavit of Hollister Chase, \n,~ 4-6). \n39.  Copies  of the  Notice  and  the  proposed  Settlement  Agreement  were  sent  by \nFirst Class  U.S.  Mail  on  September  11,  2007,  to  each  agency or organization  listed  in  the \n- 23 -\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 09/26/07   Page 23 of 30   Document 173 \n\nProposed Plan for Distribution of Notice of Proposed Settlement Agreement previously approved \nby the Court (R. 166). \n40.  The Notice was distributed to the persons, agencies, and organizations and in the \nmamler  required  in  the  Court's  Order  Preliminarily  Approving  the  Proposed  Settlement \nAgreement,  Directing  Distribution  of the  Notice  of Proposed  Settlement  Agreement,  and \nScheduling Fairness Hearing (R. 165). \nApplication of the Factors Required by Armstrong \nStrength of the Plaintiffs' Case \n41.  Although the Court has concluded that Plaintiffs have alleged a sufficient threat of \nfuture injury to support standing in a constitutional sense (R. 86:7-10;  106:2-3), the Court has \nexpressly recognized that none of the named plaintiffs has, as yet, been injured in a legal sense \n(R. 86:7).  This is true whether injury consists of being forced to move involuntarily to another \nCBRF or AFH, as Plaintiffs insist, or being forced to move involuntarily to a less integrated more \nrestrictive institutional setting, as defendants insist.  See FOF 21(a), above. \n42.  The Defendants all deny that Plaintiffs or their class are being forced to move to \ndifferent AFHs or CBRFs because of inadequate Family Care rates,  and have preserved for \npossible appeal the legal argument that, even if proven, such forced moves would not constitute \nactionable claims under the Rehabilitation Act or the ADA.  In addition, the Defendants strongly \ndeny that Plaintiffs or their class are being forced into institutional (i.e., more restrictive, less \nintegrated) settings as a result of allegedly inadequate Family Care capitated or provider rates. \nDuring discovery so  far,  Plaintiffs have supplied the Defendants with  very little evidence to \n- 24-\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 09/26/07   Page 24 of 30   Document 173 \n\nsupport a claim that Family Care emollees are being forced into institutional settings because of \ninadequate Family Care rates. \n43.  Although the Court has concluded that all eight of Plaintiffs' four paired ADA \nand  Rehabilitation  Act  claims  survive  in  limited  respects,  it  is  conceptually  difficult  to \ndistinguish between the four pairs of claims.  See FOF 21 (a)-( d), above.  Moreover, some claims \nare sufficiently vague that they present difficult proof problems for the Plaintiffs, who have the \nburden of proof.  For example, to  the extent Plaintiffs claim discrimination on the basis of \n\"severity of disability,\" as described in FOF 21 (a), Plaintiffs have the burden of identifying and \nproving if and how members of the plaintiff class are treated differently as a result of the degree \nof individual disability, and, in addition, that the Family Care capitated or provider rates have a \ncausal  connection  to  such  differential  treatment.  The  defendants  deny  that  plaintiffs  have \nproduced probative evidentiary support for this claim during the discovery conducted so far. \n44.  The  Court  has  also  limited  the  relief available  to  prospective  injunctive  and \ndeclaratory relief for the class as a whole (R. 86:22).  As a result, the parties have agreed that \nfurther discovery and litigation would focus on the setting of the DHFS capitated rates and the \nCounty provider rates for calendar years 2006 and 2007 (FOF 23), and they have agreed that \ndiscovery would focus on a variety of technical, systemic, and factual questions requiring the \ngathering of extensive expert testimony concerning the legal adequacy of the rates (id.). \n45.  Obtaining the evidence Plaintiffs need to prove that the DHFS capitated rates for \n2006 and 2007 have a discriminatory effect on the plaintiff class will necessarily require heavy \nreliance on  expert testimony.  Such technical expertise is  expensive and Plaintiffs have not \nproduced evidentiary support for this claim during the discovery conducted so far.  Plaintiffs will \nalmost certainly face difficult proof problems if they are to discharge their burden of proving that \n- 25-\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 09/26/07   Page 25 of 30   Document 173 \n\nthe actuarially-calculated federally-approved state capitated rates are inadequate and are, in fact, \ncausing actionable ham1 to the plaintiffs' class. \n46.  Plaintiffs' claim that the rates paid by the MCDA CMO to the many individual \nproviders of AFHs and CBRFs serving current Fanlily Care enrollees are inadequate and will \nforce enrollees into institutional settings will both require substantial additional discovery and \nwill present substantial proof problems as  well.  The Plaintiffs have conducted considerable \ndiscovery concerning the rates paid to Milwaukee Family Care providers, and may well have \ngathered evidence that the rates paid to AFH and CBRF providers are not satisfactory to at least \nsome of those providers.  However, the Defendants deny that such evidence alone is sufficient to \nprove that the provider rates are causing actionable harm to the Plaintiffs and deny that Plaintiffs \nhave produced evidence sufficient to support such a claim during the discovery conducted so far. \n47.  The  primary  form  of relief sought  by  the  plaintiffs'  class  against  the  State \nDefendants  is  either  an  increase  in  the  capitated  rates  or a  change  to  a  different  form  of \nreimbursement entirely.  Assuming Plaintiffs are able to prove a claim of discrimination under \nthe ADA or Rehabilitation Act warranting such relief, their primary prayer for relief faces an \nadditional significant hurdle based on the State Defendants' affirmative defense that the relief \nsought will  require  a fundamental  modification of the  Fanlily Care  managed care program. \nPlaintiffs' challenge to the County provider rates must overcome the same affirmative defense. \nThe  State Defendants  in  particular have  facially  strong grounds  to  support  their affirmative \ndefense,  based on  their claim that court-mandated changes in  the capitated rates or a court \nordered remedy that the Fanlily Care program institute a different form of reimbursement would \nrequire a fundamental modification of Family Care. \n-26-\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 09/26/07   Page 26 of 30   Document 173 \n\nOpinion of Counsel for the Parties \n48.  Plaintiffs have been represented throughout this case, since its initial  filing in \nMilwaukee County Circuit Court, by Robert Theine Pledl (R. 1-1: 1; 1-2:4-5). \n49.  In March 2006, Sarah J. Somers and M. Jane Perkins of the National Health Law \nProgram, Inc. joined this lawsuit as co-counsel on behalf of Plaintiffs (97). \n50.  Plaintiffs' counsel unconditionally support the terms of the proposed Settlement \nAgreement (Plaintiffs' written and oral submissions). \n51.  Throughout this  litigation,  the  State Defendants  have been represented by the \nWisconsin  Department of Justice.  Assistant Attorney General  (HAAG\")  Maureen  McGlynn \nFlanagan has appeared on behalf of the State Defendants since May 2004.  AAG Mary E. Burke \nhas appeared on behalf of the State Defendants since March 2005.  AAG David Dudley has \nappeared on behalf of the State Defendants since December 2006. \n52.  Counsel  for  the  State  Defendants  unconditionally  support  the  terms  of the \nproposed Settlement Agreement (State Defendants' written and oral submissions). \n53.  Throughout this litigation, the County Defendants have been represented by the \nMilwaukee  County  Corporation  Counsel.  Principal  Assistant  Corporation  Counsel  John \nJorgensen has appeared on behalf of the County Defendants since April 2004 (R. 5). \n54.  Counsel  for  the  County Defendants  unconditionally supports the  terms of the \nproposed Settlement Agreement (County Defendants' written and oral submissions). \n55.  All  parties  are  represented  by  competent  counsel  (R.  53-3;  R.  98;  R.  99; \nR. 102 :9-11;  Affidavit of Maureen McGlynn Flanagan, \"  1-4;  Affidavit of Mary E.  Burke, \n\"r \n\"  1-5; Affidavit of David Dudley,  1-3; County Defendants' written and oral submissions). \n- 27 -\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 09/26/07   Page 27 of 30   Document 173 \n\nStage of the Proceedings and the Extent of Discovery \nSee proposed findings of fact 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 16, 19,20, 21, 22, 23, and 24. \n56.  During  the  course  of  this  litigation,  the  County  Defendants  produced \napproximately 2,000 pages of documents in discovery, produced two persons for deposition, and \nprovided plaintiffs with direct access to files maintained at MCDA (Affidavit of Patricia Chiazor, \n~~ 4, 7; R. 120:2-3). \n57.  The Plaintiffs produced approximately  1,000 pages of documents in discovery \n(Affidavit of Patricia Chiazor, ~ 5). \n58.  Discovery  produced  by  the  State  Defendants  included  over  925  documents \nconsisting of over 7,000 total pages, as well as 6 compact disks containing in the aggregate over \n9,500 documents many of which consist of multiple pages and/or include attachments (Affidavit \nof Patricia Chiazor, ~ 6). \n59.  The  State  Defendants  promulgated  33  interrogatories  to  which  the  Plaintiffs \nresponded (Affidavit of Mary E. Burke, ~ 7). \nAbsence of Collusion \nSee proposed findings of fact 25, 26, 27, and 28. \n60.  The substantive and financial terms of the proposed Settlement Agreement result \nfrom  fair arms-length negotiations among counsel for the parties, and not from any collusion \nbetween the parties or their counsel (Affidavit of Mary E. Burke, ~~ 14-20). \nReaction of the Class to Settlement and Extent of Opposition \nNo  findings of fact regarding reaction of the class to settlement and the extent of any \nopposition to the proposed Settlement Agreement are proffered at this time.  The deadline for \n- 28 -\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 09/26/07   Page 28 of 30   Document 173 \n\nsubmission of any written comments or objections to  the proposed Settlement Agreement is \nSeptember 25,  2007, immediately prior to the date for submissions by the parties pursuant to \nwhich these proposed findings of fact  and conclusions of law are being filed (R.  165:2, 166, \n167).  On or before October 9,  2007, the  response date  established by the  Court, the State \nDefendants will submit additional proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law addressing \nthe reaction of the class to settlement and the extent of opposition to the proposed Settlement \nAgreement. (R. 165 :2, 166, 167). \nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW \n1.  The contents of the Notice of Proposed Settlement Agreement comport with the \nrequirements of procedural due process in that they were sufficient to apprise class members and \nothers of the terms of the proposed settlement and of the opportunity to be heard in respect to the \nproposed settlement. \n2.  The  Notice  of  Proposed  Settlement  Agreement  was  widely  disseminated \nthroughout the Milwaukee County community and was sufficiently provided to or made available \nto  all  interested  persons  or their  legal  representatives  to  comport with  the  requirements  of \nprocedural due process. \n3.  The interests of the plaintiff class have been adequately represented throughout \nthe course of this litigation and the settlement negotiations. \n4.  The  terms  of the  proposed  Settlement  Agreement  are,  111  their  entirety,  fair, \nreasonable, and adequate. \n- 29-\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 09/26/07   Page 29 of 30   Document 173 \n\n5.  it is unlikely that Plaintiffs would have secured any greater relief than achieved \nthrough the Settlement Agreement ifthis case had been fully tried. \nDated at Madison, Wisconsin, this 26th day of September, 2007. \nRespectfully submitted, \nJ.B.

      "text": "Case 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 80     Filed 08/05/2005     Page 1 of 10 \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nEASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n \nGERALD N., et al., \n       \nPlaintiffs, \n \n    v.              Case No. 04-C-1093 \n \n \nMILWAUKEE COUNTY, et al., \n       \n      Defendants. \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n \nREPLY BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF MILWAUKEE COUNTY’S MOTION \nFOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n \n  The defendants’  legal arguments in support of the proposition that the plaintiffs’ claims \nshould be dismissed have been thoroughly presented in the briefs already filed, and no purpose \nwould be served by recapitulating them in a reply brief.   Some aspects of the plaintiff’s \nsubmissions in opposition to the defendants’  motions do, however, call for a brief rejoinder.   \n  I.  The plaintiffs’ quasi-evidentiary submissions.  \n  The plaintiffs have filed affidavits along with their responsive brief.  They disclaim any \nintention to convert the pending motions into summary judgment motions, maintaining that this \nmaterial is provided for “illustrative” rather the “evidentiary” purposes.  Presumably, these \nsubmissions are intended to lend plausibility to the unsupported conclusory allegations of the \ncomplaint, and to persuade the court that the defendants’ alleged conduct could cause injury in \nfact to the plaintiffs that is actual and imminent, rather than merely conjectural orh ypothetical, \nso as to meet the minimum requirements for standing.   \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 80     Filed 08/05/2005     Page 2 of 10 \n  The plaintiffs’  illustrative submissions are not a sufficient substitute for factual \nallegations in the actual pleadings.  For the reasons explained in the defendant’s previous briefs, \nthose allegations show no more than conjectural or hypothetical injuries to the plaintiffs.  The \nillustrative submissions do, however, serve to illuminate the motives behind this lawsuit and to \nidentify the real parties in interest.  Certain high-cost residential providers want (or, if they are to \nbe believed, need) to make more money from Family Care clients.  Affiant Kallas threatened \nCounty Executive Walker with a federal class action lawsuit charging“ discriminatory practices” \nand “reckless disregard” against providers, Exhibit I, Kallas Aff.   Such a lawsuit, irrespective of \nits merits, would at least have been straightforward and less disingenuous than the present action.  \nHowever, those providers took a different course.   Affiant Burr precipitated a crisis with a view \nto manufacturing grounds for a lawsuit by threatening to evict Family Care clients after Family \nCare did not meet his demands for rate increases.   Milwaukee County suggests that the court \nconsider the business interests of these affiants as Family Care providers in assessing the value \nof their affidavits as illustrative support for the claims of the plaintiffs .\nII.   Intentional discrimination under the ADA and s. 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. \nThe plaintiffs argue that they have adequately pled claims of intentional discrimination \nand disparate treatment, actionable under by the ADA and s. 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, by \nalleging (1) that Milwaukee County pays lower rates to some CBRF’s  and other providers of \nresidential services for disabled Family Care clients who are over the age of 60 than the County \npays for disabled persons under the age of 60 who are served under the auspices of the Medicaid \nwaiver programs, (2) that Milwaukee County pays lower rates to some CBRF’s  and other \nproviders of residential services for disabled Family Care clients than other counties pay, and (3) \nthat Family Care clients with“ more significant disabilities” received inferior treatment in regard \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 80     Filed 08/05/2005     Page 3 of 10 \nto payment for residential services in comparison to Famil yCare clients with “less significant \ndisabilities”, Plaintiffs’ Brief in Opposition, pp. 14-15.   \nRegardless of the viability of the claim that the Milwaukee County Family Care program \npays lower rates than other counties pay for residential services for the disabled, it cannot \nreasonably be held to state a cause of action against Milwaukee County.  Milwaukee County \ncannot be liable for a disparity in treatment between two classes, only one of which is treated by \nMilwaukee County.   \nWith regard to the contention that Family Care rates unlawfully discriminates against \nFamily Care clients with “more significant disabilities” in paying for residential services, that \ncontention is purely an unsupported conclusion.  There are no factual allegations in the Fourth \nAmended Complaint describing any differences in the level of disability among the named \nplaintiffs or between the named plaintiffs and anyone else.  Moreover, in the absence of any \nallegation as to whether any of the named plaintiffs is more or less“ significantly disabled” than \nany other persons whose residential care is funded by Milwaukee County, it is difficult to \nimagine how any of the plaintiffs have the standing to pursue a claim based on this alleged \ndisparity, even assuming that it is both actual and actionable. \nThe case then devolves to a claim that the plaintiffs have a right under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act to force a program such as Family Care to pay whatever certain residential \nproviders demand so as to guarantee their perpetual placements in residential facilities operated \nby those providers.  The plaintiffs have not cited any case which supports such an extraordinary \nclaim. \nThe plaintiffs cite Olmstead  v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), and Henrietta D. v. \nBloomberg, 331 F.3d 261 (2nd Cir. 2003), for the proposition that courts recognize discrimination \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 80     Filed 08/05/2005     Page 4 of 10 \nclaims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act based upon differential treatment within \ngroups of individuals who all have disabilities.  That proposition does find support in the \nOlmstead decision, 527 U.S. 581, 598, fn. 10.  (in which the plurality opinion controverts the \nassertion of the dissenters that the Supreme Court had not previously interpreted \n“discrimination” to encompass disparate treatment among members of the same protected class).   \nHowever, the Olmstead plaintiffs did not achieve their limited success solely on the basis of their \nassertion of disparate treatment.  It was essential that the disparate treatment plainly operated to \nimplicate an interest protected by the ADA.   This is what the Supreme Court actually held:  \n“Specifically, we confront the question whether the proscription of discrimination [in the ADA] \nmay require placement of persons with mental disabilities in community settings rather than in \ninstitutions.  The answer, we hold, is a qualified yes.   .  .  . Unjustified isolation, we hold, is \nproperly regarded as discrimination based on disability”.  527 U.S. 581, 587 and 597.     Thanks \nto the Family Care program, none of the plaintiffs is isolated in an instituiton.  They are all in \ncommunity settings.  Nothing more than idle speculation supports the assertion that any of them \nfaces the prospect of institutionalization as a consequence of alleged disparate treatment by the \ndefendants.  It is not alleged that, in the face of Affiant Burr’s threat to evict four of the plaintiffs \nfrom his CBRF’s, they would have been placed in institutions.  On the contrary, suitable \nalternative CBRF placements were available.     The histories of the plaintiffs, as recited in the \nFourth Amended Complaint, show multiple moves between community placements, none of \nwhich resulted in nursing home or other institutional placements .\nIII.   Effective access to public services under the ADA and s. 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act. \n \n  The plain tiffs cite Henrietta D. v. Bloomberg, 331 F.3d 261 (2nd Cir. 2003), for the \nprinciple that a plaintiff can prevail by showing either discrimination or the denial of benefits or \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 80     Filed 08/05/2005     Page 5 of 10 \npublic services by reason of the plaintiff’s disabilities.  However, Henrietta D. is inapposite to \nthis case. \n  The plaintiffs in Henrietta D. suffered from disabilities resulting from HIV-AIDS and \nrelated diseases.  They were the intended beneficiaries of a program designed to assist them in \nobtaining various welfare benefits and public services to which they were entitled but which, by \nreason of the debilitating conditions peculiar to their disease, they were often physically unable \nto avail themselves of.  Those plaintiffs were able to show that this program was so \nincompetently administered and ineffectual that they could not, by reason of their disabilities, \nobtain the benefits and services to which they were entitled and which other persons were able to \naccess.   \n  In this case, the plaintiffs are all enjoying the benefits of the Fma ily Care program.  There \nis nothing in the allegations of the Fourth Amended Complaint to suggest that there is any \nwelfare benefit or public service to which they are entitled that they are not receiving.    The \nplaintiffs point to the Par. 148 of the Fourth Amended Complaint, in which it is alleged that \ndiscrimination on the part of the defendants “prevent[s] [plaintiffs] from obtaining the same \nresult, gaining the same benefit or reaching the same level of achievement in the most integrated \nsetting appropriate to their needs and have the purpose of effect of defeating or substantially \nimpairing accomplishment of the objectives of the Family Care and Medicaid program”s.   Those \nallegations are pure legal conclusions which find no support in the factual allegations of the \ncomplaint.  So far as those factual allegations disclose, all the plaintiffs are in community \nsettings (presumably, the most integrated settings appropriate to their needs) and receiving such \nother benefits as may flow from their eligibiltiy for Family Care and Medicaid.  Again, all that \ncan be discerned from the allegations of the Fourth Amended Complaint with regard to impact of \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 80     Filed 08/05/2005     Page 6 of 10 \ndefendants’ alleged disparate treatment of the plaintiffs is that it might result in a move from one \ncommunity placement to another because Affiants Kallas and Burr demand higher CBRF rates \nthan Family Care is able to pay.    That is a far cry from the desperate situation of the indigent \nAIDS victims in Henrietta D. who, due to their disabilities, were unable obtani food stamps and \nother basic public assistance benefits to which they were entitled.   \nIV.   The integration requirement of the ADA and s. 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. \n \n  It bears repeating that “[t]he purpose of the [integration mandate] regulation is not to \nconstitute the federal courts the supervisors of the care and treatment of disabled persons.  It is to \nprevent the isolation or segregation of the disabled.”  Bruggeman v. Blagojevich, 324 F.3d 906, \n911 (7th Cir. 2003).  None of the plaintiffs is isolated or segregated.  They are all in community \nplacements and there is nothing in the Fourth Amended Complaint, apart from sheer speculation, \nto suggest that they will not remain in community placements so long as such placements are \ncommensurate with their individual needs.    \nThe situation of the plaintiffs in this case differs significantly from that of the plaintiffs i n \nFisher v. Oklahoma Health Care Authority, 335 F.3d 1175 (10th Cir. 2003).  In that case, the \nplaintiffs, who were supported in community placements as beneficiaries of Medicaid waiver \nprograms comparable to the defendants’ COP programs, challenged a policy of the state \nMedicaid program which severely limited prescription drug coverage for beneficiaries of the \ncommunity based services program while providing more comprehensive coverage for nursing \nhome residents.   The plaintiffs were able to make a factual showing that this policy placed them \nat imminent risk of avoidable nursing home placement sufficient to create a genuine issue of fat c\nas to whether the policy violated the integration mandate.     \n \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 80     Filed 08/05/2005     Page 7 of 10 \nV.  Reasonable accommodation. \n  The plaintiffs have thoughtfully directed the cour’ts (and this writer’s) attention to the \nrecent decision of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals inW  isconsin Communtiy Service v. City \nof Milwaukee, ___ F.3d. ___, 2005 WL 1523215 (7th Cir., June 29, 2005).   That decision \nindicates that, in a case under Title II of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, a demand for  \n“reasonable accommodation” does not give rise to a freestanding claim but rather comes into \nplay only if and when a plaintiff can establish a case of actionable discrimination under some \nother theory, such as intentional discrimination or disparate impact.   Milwaukee County agrees \nwith the plaintiffs that the ultimate resolution of that issue is not critical to the disposition of the \npending motions in this case.  Milwaukee County respectfully submits that the plaintiffs have not \nmade out a case of actionable discrimination under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, but that, \neven if they had, the court could not order the accommodation they demand because it is not \nreasonable.  It would fundamentally alter the nature of the Family Care program and would \nimpose undue financial and administrative budrens on the defendants.   \n  The plaintiffs in this action, functioning as straw men for a couple of hig-hcost residential \ncare providers, are attempting to hold the Family Care program hostage until the demands of \nthose providers for higher rates are satisfied.  As the defendants have argued at length in the \nbriefs previously filed, if those providers are permitted to succeed, the financial burden on the \nprogram is self evident, as is the fact that the nature of the program would be altered beyond \nrecognition.      \nVI.  Medicaid Act claims. \nThe arguments for and against the recognition of a private cause of action for Medicaid \nbeneficiaries under 42 U.S.C. s. 1396a(a)(30)(a) have been thoroughly discussed in the briefs \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 80     Filed 08/05/2005     Page 8 of 10 \nalready filed.  However, even if the court decides that such a private right exists, the plaintiffs’ \nsubmissions do not establish that the defendants have violated it. \nThe court should require more than hand-wringing and threats to sustain a claim under s. \n(30)(a).    All that plaintiffs have alelged is dire predictions of the loss of residential providers \nbecause Family Care rates are too low, now supported by illustrative submissions which consist \nlargely of self-serving affidavits from CBRF operators who complain, unsurprisingly, that they \nare not making enough money caring for Family Care beneficiaries.   But those same \nsubmissions also include the uncontroverted representation that very few residential or other care \nproviders have actually left the Family Care provider network for any reason,K  allas Aff., \nExhibit H.  At this advanced stage of the game, after the case has been pending for many months \nand plaintiffs’ counsel has had years prior to the commencement of the action to collect plaintiffs \nand information, plaintiffs have not offered to identify a single provider which has gone out of \nbusiness or stopped serving Family Care clients, or to identify a single Family Care beneficiary \nwho was forced into institutional care or otherwise adversely affected because Family Care had \nfailed to enlist a sufficient number of CBRF’s and other residential care providers.   They have \nnot offered to make even a minimal showing sufficient to establish a viable claim under s. \n(30)(a).   \nVII.  Standing and the “putative class”. \n  No attempt will be made here to improve upon the exposition of the jurisprudence of \nstanding which the State of Wisconsin defendants have presented.    \n  At the risk of some redundancy, however, defendant Milwaukee County urges the court \nto consider, under the rubric of standing and also of common sense, the distance between what \nthe plaintiffs can factually and fairly allege about their own situations and the rather more \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 80     Filed 08/05/2005     Page 9 of 10 \nexpansive conclusory allegations which, they maintain, constitute viable causes of action.  The \nplaintiffs are six individuals who might have to make the transition from the care provided at the \nCBRF’s where they now reside to the care provided at different CBRF’s  (all of which has been \nand will be paid for by the defendants so long as they remain eligible for Family aCre) because \ntwo CBRF operators demand higher rates for their care than the Family Care program can pay.   \nThe allegations in the Fourth Amended Complaint disclose that they have made such transitions \nin the past.  There is nothing in the pleadings from which the court can reasonably infer that any \nof the named plaintiffs has been deprived of any right protected by the ADA or the \nRehabilitation Act as the result of discriminatory “disparate treatment” by the defendants, that \nany of them has been denied, by reason of disability, any benefit or service to which he or she is \nentitled, or that any of them is or is likely to be in “unjustified institutional isolation” in violation \nof the integration mandate.    There is likewise nothing in the pleadings from which the court can \nreasonably infer that any of the plaintiffs has been harmed in any way by a failure of the \ndefendants to enlist sufficient care providers as required by 42 U.S.C. s. 1396(a)(30)( A). \n  Nor should the plaintiffs be permitted to “borrow” standing to assert those claims from \nsome imaginary putative class plaintiffs.  As mentioned above, plaintiff’ scounsel has had a long \ntime to troll for plaintiffs, yet he is unable to identify and plead the cause of even one real \nplaintiff who can allege that the defendants’ discrimination on the basis of disability has caused \nhis or her unjustified institutional placement, has denied him or her any right or benefit to which \nhe or she is entitled, or has deprived him or her of any right or caused him or her any injury \nwhich would give rise to a cognizable claim under the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, or the \nMedicaid Act.   He should not be permitted to continue to this action. \n   \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 80     Filed 08/05/2005     Page 10 of 10 \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, together with those set forth in the previously filed briefs and \nin the reply brief of the State of Wisconsin defendants, Milwaukee County respectfully urges the \ncourt to dismiss the Fourth Amended Complaint under Rule 12(c), on the grounds that the named \nplaintiffs do not state claims upon which relief can be granted because the claims as stated are \nnot cognizable or, with regard to those sections of the complaint which may describe viable \nprivate causes of action, the plaintiffs lack the standing to raise them .\n  Dated at Milwaukee, Wisconsin this 5th day of August, 2005. \nOFFICE OF CORPORATION COUNSEL \n \nBy:___/s/ John Jorgensen__________ \nJohn Jorgensen \nPrincipal Assistant Corporation Counsel \nState Bar No. 01017484 \nAttorneys for Defendant Milwaukee County \n \nP.O.

For  the  most  part,  the  State \ndefendants rely on the arguments and authorities set forth in their brief-in-chief, much of which is \nignored and not disputed by plaintiffs’ brief in opposition. \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 81-1     Filed 08/05/2005     Page 2 of 15(cid:10)\nISSUES ARGUED IN REPLY \n  1.  Must the affidavits of plaintiffs’ experts be stricken because their purpose is \nclearly evidentiary and not, as plaintiffs assert, merely illustrative? \n  2.  Must  the  Fourth  Amended  Complaint  be  dismissed  for  lack  of  jurisdiction \nbecause plaintiffs lack standing or because their claims of possible future injury are not ripe for \nadjudication?  \n  3.  Have  plaintiffs  failed  to  rebut  defendants’  arguments  demonstrating  the \ninadequacy of plaintiffs’ various claims for relief under the ADA, Rehab Act § 504 and the \nMedicaid statute privately enforceable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983? \nARGUMENT \nI.  THE AFFIDAVITS OF PLAINTIFFS’ EXPERTS MUST BE STRICKEN \nBECAUSE THEIR PURPOSE IS CLEARLY EVIDENTIARY RATHER \nTHAN  ILLUSTRATIVE,  SO  THAT  IT  IS  IMPROPER  FOR  THE \nCOURT  TO  CONSIDER  THEM  FOR  PURPOSES  OF  DECIDING \nMOTIONS  TO  DISMISS  AND  FOR  JUDGMENT  ON  THE \nPLEADINGS, RULES 12(B)(6) AND (C). \n  The State defendants have submitted motions to dismiss based on F.R.C.P. 12(b)(6) and \n12(c) and Milwaukee County seeks judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c).  Although \nthe State defendants have submitted documents which can be judicially noticed and considered in \nthe  context  of  deciding  legal  motions  concerning  the  sufficiency  of  the  complaint  without \nconverting the legal motions into motions for summary judgment, see brief-in-chief at 28-29, all \nof the defendants have carefully limited their submissions to materials the Court can properly \nconsider in deciding legal motions concerning the sufficiency of the complaint. \n  Plaintiffs concede that the State defendants’ brief-in-chief contains a reasonably complete \nsummary of the factual allegations of the Fourth Amended Complaint.  See Brief at 4.  However, \nplaintiffs have also filed with their brief in opposition voluminous attached materials which they \n- 2 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 81-1     Filed 08/05/2005     Page 3 of 15(cid:10)\ndiscuss freely throughout their brief, even going so far as to refer to a work-in-progress by \nanother expert that is not even submitted or properly identified (see brief at 9, n.2).  See also \nAffidavit  of  Gerald  J.  Kallas,  M.D.  (with  attachments),  Affidavit  of  Thomas  Cook  (with \nattachments), and Second Affidavit of Lincoln Burr.  These affidavits and nearly all of the \nevidentiary  material  attached,  unlike  the  government  documents  referenced  in  the  State \ndefendants’ motions to dismiss, are not properly subject to judicial notice because they are not \n“capable  of  accurate  and  ready  determination  by  resort  to  sources  whose  accuracy  cannot \nreasonably be questioned.”  Fed. R.  Evid. Rule 201(b); see brief-in-chief at 28-29 (citing cases). \n  Plaintiffs seek to justify their submission and substantial reliance on these materials on \nthe pretense that the materials are not submitted for “evidentiary” purposes, i.e. to supplement the \nfactual allegations of the complaint relating to standing and the nature of plaintiffs’ claims, but \nare simply submitted for “illustrative” purposes, i.e., to show that “there might be” a set of facts \nconsistent with the allegations in the complaint.  See Brief at 4-5, 13 n.3, citing Thomas v. \nGuardsmark, Inc., 381 F.3d 701, 704 (7th Cir. 2004); and Hart v. Sheahan, 396 F.3d 887, 895 \n(7th Cir. 2005).  Despite plaintiffs’ attempts to label these materials otherwise, they appear to be \nevidentiary in nature and are certainly used for evidentiary purposes to support plaintiffs’ claims \nof standing and regarding the sufficiency of the numerous claims.  Plaintiffs refer to facts and \nopinions stated in these affidavits as if they were set forth in the complaint and as if they must be \naccepted as true for purposes of the pending motions, rather than for “illustrative” purposes at all. \n- 3 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 81-1     Filed 08/05/2005     Page 4 of 15(cid:10)\nThe State defendants respectfully submit that these affidavits and attached documentation should \nbe stricken or ignored by the court in deciding the pending motions.1 \nII.  THE  FOURTH  AMENDED  COMPLAINT  MUST  BE  DISMISSED \nBECAUSE THE INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFFS LACK STANDING AND \nTHEIR CLAIMS OF POSSIBLE FUTURE INJURY ARE NOT RIPE \nFOR ADJUDICATION. \nA.  Plaintiffs misstate the law by arguing that individual plaintiffs need \nnot have standing so long as unnamed members of the putative \nclass do. \n  Tacitly recognizing the weakness of their individual claims of actual or threatened injury \nand, therefore, standing, plaintiffs repeatedly suggest that whether or not they have individual \nstanding does not matter because “[s]tanding in class actions is determined with reference to the \nclass as a whole rather than simply looking at the potential impact on the named plaintiffs,” brief \nat 1-2.  See also id. at 24-25 (arguing that if plaintiffs lack standing, the court should hold the \nquestion  of  standing  in  abeyance  until  after  a  class  is  certified).    This  argument  is  flatly, \ndemonstrably and unequivocally wrong and it is no accident plaintiffs cite no authority to support \nit.  Indeed, the very cases plaintiffs cite contradict the argument.  For example, in Payton v. \nCounty of Kane, 308 F.3d 673, 682 (7th Cir. 2002), a case which turned on the propriety of \ncertifying  a  defendant rather than a plaintiff class, the court had no doubt that the named \n                                                 \n  1Because this reply brief will focus primarily on the legal issues relating to standing and \nthe  adequacy  of  plaintiffs’  numerous  claims,  and  because  plaintiffs  concede  that  the  State \ndefendants have accurately summarized the factual contents of the amended complaint that must \nbe  taken  as  true  for  purposes  of  the  motions,  the  Kallas,  Cook  and  Burr  affidavits  and \nattachments are not discussed in detail in this brief.  For the most part, however, the affidavits \nappear to repeat at length facts, opinions, conjecture and hypotheses that are already outlined in \nthe complaint.  To the extent the affidavits go beyond the complaint, the State defendants \nstrongly object to their consideration for purposes of deciding the pending motions. \n- 4 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 81-1     Filed 08/05/2005     Page 5 of 15(cid:10)\nplaintiffs themselves had individual standing.  See Id., 308 F.3d at 677.  There, the court \npointedly emphasized: \n  This is not a case where the named plaintiff is trying to piggy-back on the \ninjuries of the unnamed class members.  That, of course, would be impermissible, \nin light of the fact that “a named plaintiff cannot acquire standing to sue by \nbringing his action on behalf of others who suffered injury which would have \nafforded them standing had they been named plaintiffs;  it bears repeating that a \nperson cannot predicate standing on injury which he does not share.  Standing \ncannot be acquired through the back door of a class action.”   \n \nId., 308 F.3d at 682 (emphasis supplied), quoting Allee v. Medrano, 416 U.S. 802, 828-29 (1974) \n(Burger,  C.J.,  dissenting).    See  also  Simon  v.  Eastern  Ky.  Welfare  Rights  Organization, \n426 U.S. 26, 40 n.20 (1976), quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490 (1975):  “That a suit may be \na class action . . . adds nothing to the question of standing, for even named plaintiffs who \nrepresent a class ‘must allege and show that they personally have been injured, not that injury has \nbeen suffered by other, unidentified members of the class to which they belong and which they \npurport to represent.’”   \n  If none of the named plaintiffs have standing, this case must be dismissed:  “[I]f none of \nthe  named  plaintiffs  purporting  to  represent  a  class  establishes  the  requisite  of  a  case  or \ncontroversy with the defendants, none may seek relief on behalf of himself or any other member \nof the class.”  O’Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 494 (1974); see also Bailey v. Patterson, \n369 U.S.31, 32 (1962) (plaintiffs cannot represent a class of whom they are not a part). \nB.  Because plaintiffs do not dispute their lack of standing to seek \nretroactive relief, it will likely be unnecessary for the Court to \nreach the question whether their claims for retroactive declaratory \nand monetary relief against the State defendants are barred by the \nEleventh Amendment and sovereign immunity. \n  Both the State defendants brief-in-chief at 23-27 and plaintiffs’ response brief at 25-28 \nargue the scope of this Court’s jurisdiction and authority to award plaintiffs the retroactive \n- 5 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 81-1     Filed 08/05/2005     Page 6 of 15(cid:10)\ndeclaratory and monetary relief they seek against the State defendants in view of the Eleventh \nAmendment and the State’s sovereign immunity.  However, the plaintiffs have failed to respond \nto—and  appear  implicitly  to  concede—the  State  defendants’  argument  that  plaintiffs  lack \nstanding to seek retroactive declaratory or monetary relief against any of the defendants for the \nperiod prior to filing of this lawsuit because they have not alleged any direct or tangible injury to \nthemselves for that period of time.  See brief-in-chief at 15-18; cf. plaintiffs’ brief at 22 (asserting \n“a substantial likelihood they will be harmed by the alleged violations of federal law that they \nhave identified in the Family Care program”) (emphasis added). \n  Based on other cases plaintiffs have cited, this implicit concession of partial lack of \nstanding is well advised.  See Tandy v. City of Wichita, 380 F.3d 1277, 1283-84, 1289-90 \n(10th Cir. 2004) (recognizing that the “injury in fact” requirement of constitutional standing is \nsatisfied differently depending on whether the plaintiff seeks prospective or retrospective relief).  \nAccord:  Discovery House. v. Consol City of Indianapolis, 319 F.3d 277, 280 (7th Cir. 2003) \n(quoting prior Supreme Court precedent that “‘a plaintiff must demonstrate standing separately \nfor each form of relief sought’”).   \n  The Tandy decision first recites the familiar three requirements for establishing Article III \nstanding: \n  To establish Article III standing, a plaintiff must show that:  (1) she has \nsuffered an “injury in fact” that is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or \nimminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the \nchallenged action of the defendant; and (3) it is likely, as opposed to merely \nspeculative, that the injury will be redressed by the relief requested. \n \nId., 380 F.3d at 1283 (footnote and citations omitted).   \n  With regard to retrospective relief, a plaintiff “satisfies the ‘injury in fact’ requirement if \nshe suffered a past injury that is concrete and particularized.”  Tandy, 380 F.3d at 1284.  As \n- 6 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 81-1     Filed 08/05/2005     Page 7 of 15(cid:10)\ndiscussed in the State defendants’ brief-in-chief at 17, and plaintiffs do not dispute, none of the \nplaintiffs claims any past violation of the integration, least restrictive setting and reasonable \naccommodation  requirements  of  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  (“ADA”)  and \nRehabilitation Act, nor any violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A) (“(a)(30)(A)”), with regard \nto themselves personally.  Because plaintiffs claim no past injury whatever to themselves, it \nnecessarily follows that they lack standing to seek retrospective declaratory or monetary relief.  \nSee Tandy, 380 F.3d at 1283-84. \nC.  Plaintiffs lack standing based on threats to their current residential \nplacements and their claims of threatened future injury are not ripe \nfor adjudication. \n  The State defendants refer the Court to the arguments contained in their brief-in-chief \nat 21.  Plaintiffs do not challenge the State defendants’ argument that they lack standing to \nchallenge  the  capitated  rates  DHFS  pays  to  the  Milwaukee  County  Care  Management \nOrganization (“CMO”) under the terms of the Family Care contract, see id. at 21-23.  However, \nthey do make an unconvincing attempt to argue current and future standing based on threats to \ntheir current residential placements and their claims that, if they are required to change their \ncommunity placements at all, they are “likely to suffer harm including institutionalization,” brief \nat 24. \n  First, plaintiffs assert that they have a “legitimate interest in continuing to live in a \nparticular  home  of  their  choice,”  brief  at  22.    Whether  they  have  a  legitimate,  subjective, \nheartfelt, sincere interest in continuing to stay in their current residential placements, however, \nsimply begs the real question relevant to the question of standing:  whether this interest is one \nprotected by the laws plaintiffs seek to invoke, and therefore, one that is likely to be redressed by \n- 7 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 81-1     Filed 08/05/2005     Page 8 of 15(cid:10)\na favorable decision according them relief authorized by those statutes.  Cf. Valley Forge, Etc. v. \nAmericans United, Etc., 454 U.S. 464, 472 (1982); Tandy, 380 F.3d at 1283.   \n  As pointed out previously, a court has jurisdiction under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nto insure that plaintiffs remain in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs and that \nthey be reasonably accommodated.  Plaintiffs have failed to cite any authority for the proposition \nthat this Court has the authority under the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act or the Medical Assistance \n(“MA”) statutes to require that plaintiffs remain in a particular or specific community placement, \nif, as plaintiffs’ residential providers threaten here, those providers no longer participate in the \nFamily Care program.  Indeed, the State defendants have not located any precedent supporting \nthis  proposition  either.    Therefore,  plaintiffs  cannot  establish  standing  based  on  the  mere \nlikelihood that they will need to move to a different community placement if their providers \nmake good on their threats to terminate their Family Care contracts, because such a move is not a \nlegally cognizable injury that this court can likely redress. \n  In order to seek prospective relief,  \n[T]he  plaintiff  must  be  suffering  a  continuing  injury  or  be under a real and \nimmediate threat of being injured in the future. . . .  The threatened injury must be \n“certainly  impending”  and  not  merely  speculative.    A  claimed  injury  that  is \ncontingent  upon  speculation  or  conjecture is beyond the bounds of a federal \ncourt’s jurisdiction. \n \nTandy, 380 F.3d at 1283-84 (citations omitted). \n  Another case cited by plaintiffs clearly illustrates the difference between a case in which a \nthreat of future injury is real and immediate—and thus sufficient to demonstrate standing—and \nthis case, where the threats of future injury in the form of plaintiffs’ having to move to a nursing \nhome are merely speculative and conjectural.  See Fisher v. Oklahoma Health Care Authority, \n335 F.3d 1175 (10th Cir. 2003).  In Fisher, the plaintiffs were participants in a community-based \n- 8 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 81-1     Filed 08/05/2005     Page 9 of 15(cid:10)\nMedicaid  program  in  which  the  Oklahoma  Health  Care  Authority  had  previously  provided \nunlimited, medically-necessary prescription benefits for participants in the community-based \nprogram and had provided such prescription benefits for institutionalized MA recipients as well.   \n  In order to deal with a funding crisis, the Health Care Authority decided to terminate the \nunlimited, medically-necessary prescription benefits for the community-based recipients, limiting \nthem to five prescriptions per month, regardless of medical necessity.  Id., 335 F.3d at 1177-78.  \nThe plaintiffs were community-based recipients with very high monthly prescription costs and, \ntypical of Medicaid-eligible persons, very low income.  Id., 335 F.3d at 1179-80.  Because the \nprescriptions were medically necessary, Fisher and the other plaintiffs faced a real and immediate \nthreat of institutionalization in order to continue to obtain the medications their health required.  \nWhile the defendants in Fisher denied discrimination and disputed the merits of the plaintiffs’ \nADA and Rehabilitation Act claims, including whether they would really be forced into nursing \nhomes, there was simply no grounds to challenge plaintiffs’ standing because the claims of future \ninjury were sufficiently real, probable and immediate. \n  In contrast, here plaintiffs are threatened with nothing more than a move to a different \ncommunity placement.  Furthermore, the Milwaukee Family Care contract effectively binds the \nCMO to provide appropriate services to plaintiffs in the most integrated, least restrictive setting \nin exchange for the monthly capitated rate of those individuals.  See CMO Contract at 15, 19, \n151, 164, Addendum X.4.19 (Exhibit 2002; see brief-in-chief at 3 n.2 for full citation to the \nContract).  Plaintiffs to not allege that the CMO is violating this important obligation under the \ncontract nor is there any basis to presume that the CMO will do so in the future.  There are no \nfacts (as opposed to opinions, fears and speculation) in the complaint to support an inference that \na  change  in  community  placement,  in  itself,  will  violate  plaintiffs’  rights  to  remain  in  an \n- 9 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 81-1     Filed 08/05/2005     Page 10 of 15(cid:10)\nintegrated setting.  Rather, plaintiffs actual claim is that such a move may lead to one or more \nother changes in placement and that, ultimately, sometime in the future, they will end up in \nnursing homes, notwithstanding their desire to remain in the community.   \n  These threats of future harm, unlike those presented in Fisher, are simply too speculative \nand conjectural to support standing to litigate plaintiffs’ claims.  While the likelihood of future \nharm for purposes of establishing standing is “a matter of probabilities rather than certainties,” \nBruggeman ex rel. Bruggeman v. Blagojevich, 324 F.3d 906, 910 (7th Cir. 2003), plaintiffs here \nhave established nothing more than the possibility, not the probability, of future harm.  In short, \nplaintiffs’ claims based on threatened future injury are simply not ripe for adjudication and must \nbe dismissed for lack of standing. \nIII.  PLAINTIFFS FAIL TO STATE CLAIMS FOR RELIEF UNDER THE \nADA, THE REHABILITATION ACT OR THE MEDICAID STATUTE, \n42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A). \nA.  Plaintiffs’ ADA and Rehabilitation Act arguments must be rejected \nbecause  applicable  law  does  not  obligate  states  to  meet  all \nindividualized  preferences  and  desires  of  a  state  Medicaid \nbeneficiary. \n  Plaintiffs’ intentional discrimination and disparate impact arguments (brief at 13-15) \nfundamentally  misconstrue  ADA  and  Rehabilitation  Act  requirements.    The  ADA  and \nRehabilitation Act do not require states to provide either a particular standard of care or a \nparticular level of benefits to persons with disabilities.  They do not guarantee that each recipient \nof state medical benefits will receive care precisely tailored to his or her individual preferences.  \nInstead, they require only that a state not discriminate in the services it has chosen to provide.  \nRadaszewski v. Maram, 383 F.3d 599, 608-09 (7th Cir. 2004), citing Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. \nZimring, 527 U.S. 581, 603 n.14 (1999). \n- 10 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 81-1     Filed 08/05/2005     Page 11 of 15(cid:10)\n  The states “retain ‘substantial discretion to choose the proper mix of amount, scope and \nduration limitations on coverage.’”  Vaughn v. Sullivan, 83 F.3d 907, 912 (7th Cir. 1996), \nquoting Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 303 (1985).  The benefit provided through Medicaid \nis a particular package of health care services, with the general aim of assuring that individuals \nwill receive necessary medical services.  Alexander, 469 U.S. at 302. \n  The ADA and Rehabilitation Act do not require that decisions affecting allocation of \nprogram resources, including decisions relating to funding of those resources, be made in a way \nthat meets the preference of each individual program beneficiary.  For example, closure of a \nspecialized facility did not run afoul of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act when most services \nprovided at that facility were to be provided at a new location one mile away.  Cercpac v. Health \n& Hospitals Corp., 147 F.3d 165, 168 (2nd Cir. 1998).  Contrast that with a cost-saving measure \nimpermissibly eliminating the only county hospital focused on the needs of disabled individuals, \nproviding services disproportionately required by the disabled and available nowhere else in the \ncounty.  Rodde v. Bonta, 357 F.3d 988, 996-97 (9th Cir. 2004).  Even plaintiffs conjure up \nnothing so drastic. \n  The forgoing authorities further rebut plaintiffs’ confusing claims about “effective access \nto health care services” (brief at 15-16).  See also brief-in-chief at 36-37.  \n  As  for  plaintiffs’  arguments  about  integration  requirements  of  the  ADA  and \nRehabilitation Act (brief at 16-17), plaintiffs already benefit from community placements serving \nthem in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs.  The CMO, by contract, must \ncontinue to provide all services necessary to cost-effectively meet the plaintiffs’ assessed needs.  \nSee’ brief-in-chief at 7-8, 38-39.  As explained at pages 9-10 above, the present plaintiffs’ \ncircumstances are easily distinguished from those of the Fisher plaintiffs. \n- 11 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 81-1     Filed 08/05/2005     Page 12 of 15(cid:10)\n  Plaintiffs fail to identify a single authority indicating that integration requirements of the \nADA  and  Rehabilitation  Act  entitle  them  to  demand  specific  providers,  regardless  of  the \nparameters of the state benefit package they receive.  That, however, is the bottom line of both \ntheir integration requirement claims and their reasonable accommodation claims (brief at 17-18). \nControlling case law proves otherwise.  Radaszewski, 383 F.3d at 608-09; Olmstead, 527 U.S. at \n603 n.14; Vaughn, 83 F.3d at 912; Alexander, 469 U.S. at 303.  See also brief-in-chief at 38-39.   \n  Moreover,  because  the  present  plaintiffs  fail  to  make  out  a  prima  facie  case  of \ndiscrimination, the issue of reasonable accommodation is not properly before the Court.  When \nproperly  considered  in  response  to  a  prima  facie  case  of  discrimination,  reasonable \naccommodations can be ordered to alleviate barriers hindering equal opportunity to accessing \nservices and benefits already provided—but not to create special substantive rights, such as \ntailoring benefits to recipients’ personal preferences.  Cf. Wisconsin Cmty. Services, Inc. v. City \nof Milwaukee, 413 F.3d 642, 646 (7th Cir. 2005).  \n  Similiarly, the defense of fundamental alteration is not implicated unless plaintiffs prove \nentitlement to some reasonable accommodation.  The present plaintiffs have not, so, again, this \nissue is not properly before the Court.  In any event, no legal rule prohibits resolution of \nfundamental alteration issues by judgment on the pleadings.  Cf. plaintiffs’ brief at 12-13. \n  When  a  fundamental  alteration  defense  requires  resolving  issues  of  material  fact, \nconsideration  beyond  judgment  on  the  pleadings  could  be  warranted.    McGary  v.  City  of \nPortland, 386 F.3d 1259, 1207 (9th Cir. 2004); Crowder v. Kitagawa, 81 F.3d 1480, 1485 \n(9th Cir. 1996).  Plaintiffs cite only cases where material facts concerning costs of benefit \nexpansion had to be determined and weighed against material facts concerning affected access to \nbenefits  (brief  at  12-13).    Cf.  Michelle  P.  v.  Holsinger,  356  F.  Supp.  2d  763,  764,  770 \n- 12 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 81-1     Filed 08/05/2005     Page 13 of 15(cid:10)\n(E.D. Ken. 2005)  (plaintiffs  wait-listed  for  community  based  services  apparently  sought \nexpansion of state’s Home and Community Based Services waiver program in order to receive \nservices); Radaszewski, 383 F.3d at 614 (whether funding specific, expensive placement for one \nindividual would fundamentally alter care provided by Illinois to others with similar needs).   \n  No such issue of material fact remains in the present case.  Plaintiffs freely admit what \nthey want: “[Plaintiffs] seek an overall modification of Family Care policies and changes in \noverall funding” (brief at 17; emphasis added).  The policy and funding changes plaintiffs want \nwould transform Family Care from a capitated-rate system to a demand-driven fee-for-service \nsystem (brief-in-chief at 33).  It is hard to imagine a more fundamental alteration of the policy \nand funding choices Alexander and Olmstead entitle defendants to make.  \nB.  Although plaintiffs insist, despite recent precedent, that they have a \nprivate right of action under (a)(30)(A), they fail to address or \ndispute  the  affirmative  requirements  for  stating  a  claim  under \n(a)(30)(A) and related statutes and rules governing the sufficiency \nof the capitated Family Care rates that is the focus of Claim 9. \n  The only argument plaintiffs develop with regard to the adequacy of their Medicaid claim \nbased on (a)(30)(A) is that they have a private right of action to challenge the Family Care \ncapitated rates based on § 1983 (see brief at 18-20).  While defendants believe that the Seventh \nCircuit decision in Methodist Hospitals v. Sullivan, 91 F.3d 1026 (7th Cir. 1996), recognizing a \n- 13 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 81-1     Filed 08/05/2005     Page 14 of 15(cid:10)\nprivate right of action for providers must be reexamined in light of Gonzaga University v. Doe, \n536 U.S. 273 (2002), it is up to the Seventh Circuit, not this Court, to do so.2 \n  Plaintiffs fail to analyze the facts alleged in the complaint in light of the language of \n(a)(30)(A) or, in the context of a challenge to capitated rates, the closely related requirements of \nthe  managed  care  waiver  provisions  of  42  U.S.C.  §  1396n(b)  and  the  applicable  federal \nregulation,  42  C.F.R.  §  438.6.    See  also  Clayworth  v.  Bonta,  295  F.Supp.2d  1110 \n(E.D. Cal. 2003), discussed in State defendants’ brief-in-chief at 41-42 n.22.  Instead, plaintiffs \nmake a completely conclusory argument, unsupported by analysis or citation of precedent, that \n“the complaint is clearly sufficient,” presumably to state a claim challenging the sufficiency of \nthe capitated rates under (a)(30)(A).  Brief at 19-20.  Therefore, while the State defendants \nstrongly urge that Claim 9 fails to state a claim based on (a)(30)(A), they rely on the discussion \nof this issue contained in their brief-in-chief at 39-44 which plaintiffs do not challenge. \nCONCLUSION \n  For the reasons discussed above and in their brief-in-chief, the State defendants submit \nthat the Fourth Amended Complaint must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction based on lack of \nstanding and ripeness; that claims for retroactive declaratory and monetary relief against them are \n                                                 \n  2The State defendants do, however, call to the Court’s attention the recent decision of the \nNinth Circuit in Sanchez v. Johnson, __ F.3d __, 2005 WL 1804195 (9th Cir.), decided August 2, \n2005,  affirming  the  decision  of  the  district  court  of  the  same  name,  301  F.Supp.  1060 \n(N.D. Cal. 2004).  The Tenth Circuit decision in Sanchez contains a thorough analysis of the \nlanguage of (a)(30)(A) in light of Gonzaga, and holds that the statute does not create individual \nrights enforceable under § 1983 by either Medicaid recipients or providers of Medicaid services.  \nSanchez, 2005 WL 1804195 *8.  The court also points out that, since Gonzaga, no federal court \nof appeals has concluded that (a)(30)(A) provides either Medicaid recipients or providers with a \nstatutory right enforceable under § 1983.  Sanchez, 2005 WL 1804194 *4.   \n- 14 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 81-1     Filed 08/05/2005     Page 15 of 15(cid:10)\nbarred by sovereign immunity and the Eleventh Amendment; and that the various claims in the \ncomplaint must be dismissed because they fail to state claims on which relief can be granted. \n  Dated this 5th day of August, 2005. \n  Respectfully submitted, \n \n  PEGGY A.

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nEASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n \nGERALD N., et al., \n       \nPlaintiffs, \n \n    v.              Case No. 04-C-1093 \n \n \nMILWAUKEE COUNTY, et al., \n       \n      Defendants. \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n \nBRIEF IN SUPPORT OF MILWAUKEE COUNTY’S MOTION \nFOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n \nThis action was commenced on January 28, 2004.   It is now before the court on the \nplaintiffs’ Fourth Amended Complaint.  Although the Fourth Amended Complaint is an \nimprovement (at least from the defendants’ perspective) over the Third Amended Complaint (41 \npages, 234 paragraphs, 10 named plaintiffs), it still runs to 34 pages and 184 paragraphs and it \nsets out nine separate legal counts1.   \nThe defendants are filing motions at this stage of the proceedings to challenge the legal \nsufficiency of the plaintiffs’ claims.  Because of the number and complexity of those claims, and \nthe interplay between the actual dimensions of the plaintiffs’ substantive claims and their \nstanding to raise them2, it may be more useful to the court to address the allegations in the Fourth \n                                                \n1 This is not quite as bad as it seems.  The plaintiffs set out parallel claims under Title II of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, 42 USC s. 12132, and s. 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S. C s. 794.   Those claims will not \nrequire separate analysis, Radaszewski v. Maram, 383 F.3d 599, 607 (7th Cir. 2004)  (“In view of the similarities \nbetween the relevant provisions of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act and their implementing regulations, courts \nconstrue and apply them in a consistent manner . . . see also Bruggeman, supra, 324  F.3d at 912 (noting that the \nstatutory and regulatory provisions concerning integrated care are ‘materially identical’.)”).    \n2 Bruggman v. Blagojevich, 324 F.3d 906, 909 (7th Cir. 2003) (“Not that standing and the merits are always or in this \ncase [which raised ADA, Rehabilitation Act and Medicaid claims] clearly distinct.”) \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 1 of 14   Document 69 \n\nAmended Complaint as they become relevant to the discussion rather than attempt to summarize \nthem in a statement of facts. \n   I.  Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings \n  At this stage of the proceedings, after multiple rounds of pleadings have been exchanged, \na motion to challenge the legal sufficiency of the plaintiffs’ claims is properly styled a motion for \njudgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c), F.R.C.P.   \n  The standard applied to a Rule 12(c) motion is the same as the standard for a motion to \ndismiss under rule 12(b).   A moving defendant will succeed only if it is clear that the factual \nallegations of the complaint will not support the plaintiff’s claim for relief.   The court must view \nthose factual allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.  However, the court is “not \nobliged to ignore any facts set forth in the complaint that undermine the plaintiff’s claim or to \nassign any weight to unsupported conclusions of law”, R.J.R. Serv., Inc. v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. \nCo., 895 F.2d 279, 281 (7th Cir. 1989).   \nII.    Standing. \nTo create a “case or controversy” sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal court \nunder Article III of the Constitution, a party must show that he or she has suffered an “injury in \nfact” that is “concrete,” distinct and palpable,” and “actual or imminent,” as opposed to \n“conjectural” of “hypothetical”. M  cConnell v. Federal Election Commission, 540 U.S. 93, 225 \n(2003).  In addition, the party must show that his or her injury is “fairly traceable” to the \ndefendant’s conduct and that there is a “substantial likelihood” that the requested relief will \nredress the harm.  Id.  Without such a showing, a federal court is without jurisdiction to entertain \nthe party’s arguments on the merits.  United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U.S. 765, 778 (2000).   \n   \n  2 \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 2 of 14   Document 69 \n\nIII.  ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims. \n   Each of the plaintiffs is a disabled person who resides in a community based residential \nfacility (CBRF) and receives additional services, all paid for by the Family Care program \nadministered by the Milwaukee County Department on Aging (MCDA).   But for their various \ndisabling conditions, they would be ineligible for the funding and services they receive through \nFamily Care.  It is therefore unsurprising that their attempts to articulate viable claims under the \nADA and the Rehabilitation Act against the Family Care program present conceptual difficulties. \n  In Washington  v. Indiana H.S. Athletic Assn., Inc.,181 F.3d 840, 847 (7th Cir. 1999), the \nSeventh Circuit Court of Appeals adopted a plain language standard which is helpful in \nanalyzing the claims in this case:  “In our view, the Sixth Circuit outlined correctly . . . the \nvarious methods of proof in s. 504 Rehabilitation Act or Title II ADA claims:  discrimination \nunder both acts may be established by evidence that (1) the defendant intentionally acted on the \nbasis of the disability, (2) the defendant refused to provide a reasonable modification, or (3) the \ndefendant’s rule disproportionately impacts disabled people.” \nA.  The defendants have not intentionally discriminated against the plaintiffs \nbecause of their disabilities. \n \n  This method of establishing a claim under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act (essentially, \n“adverse treatment”) is clearly absent from the plaintiffs’ Fourth Amended Complaint.  The \nplaintiffs have not alleged that the features of the Family Care program of which they complain \nare the result of any purposeful animus against them or against persons with disabilities \ngenerally, nor have they identified any “comparison class” of non-disabled persons singled out \nfor preferable treatment.  \n \n \n \n  3 \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 3 of 14   Document 69 \n\nB.  The features of the Family Care program of which the plaintiffs complain do not \ndisproportionately affect disabled persons. \n \nThe allegations of the Fourth Amended Complaint are not sufficient to establish a claim \nunder the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act under a theory of disparate impact. \nAny discussion of disparate impact logically requires the designation of a “comparison \nclass” whose treatment under the rule or program under attack can be compared with the \ntreatment received by the plaintiffs.  When disabled plaintiffs assert claims under the ADA and \nthe Rehabilitation Act, one might expect the comparison class to be persons who are not \nsimilarly disabled.   However, there are no allegations in the complaint about any non-disabled \npersons.  The plaintiffs’ disparate impact theory must therefore be of a non-traditional sort for \nADA and Rehabilitation Claims, and in fact it is. \nBecause the plaintiffs are eligible disabled persons over the age of 60, their community-\nbased residential care and services are paid for by the Family Care program.  Under that program \n(the basics of which are described with reasonable accuracy in the Fourth Amended Complaint), \nthe MCDA (in its role as the Family Care CMO) receives a capitated monthly rate from the State \nfor each beneficiary of the program.  From that funding, MCDA pays for the care and treatment \nof each beneficiary, as determined by that beneficiary’s individual needs and care plan.  Eligible \npersons with similar disabilities under the age of 60 who reside in the community are served by \nthe MCDHS Disabilities Services Division under the “traditional” Medical Assistance waiver \nprograms (COP, CIP, etc., as described in the Fourth Amended Complaint).  One consequence of \nthe introduction of the Family Care as a program operated on an HMO model and administered \nseparately from the Medical Assistance waiver programs is that the Family Care program pays \nsome CBRF operators and other service providers a lower rate for persons over the age of 60 \n  4 \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 4 of 14   Document 69 \n\nthan those operators receive for similarly disabled persons under the age of 60 whose care is \nfunded under the Medical Assistance waiver programs.   \nThis, then, is the gravamen of the Fourth Amended Complaint:  Family Care pays some \nCBRF operators and ancillary treatment providers at lower rates than those same providers \nwould receive for the same beneficiaries if they were under 60 years old and, therefore,  \nbeneficiaries of the Medical Assistance waiver programs rather than Family Care. \nThe disparity upon which the plaintiffs rely (that is, between disabled persons over 60 \nwhose care is paid by the defendants under Family Care and disabled persons under 60 whose \ncare is paid for by the defendants under the traditional Medical Assistance waiver programs) will \nnot support their claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.  \nThe plaintiffs attempt to make more of this claimed disparity than the factual allegations \nof their complaint will bear.   They allege that Family Care beneficiaries receive “substantially \ninferior treatment in regard to payment for services”, (Paragraphs 143(A), (B) and (C) and \n162(A), (B) and (C), Fourth Amended Complaint).  But there is no factual allegation which will \nsupport an inference that the difference, even with respect to payment, is “substantial”.  More \nimportantly, there is nothing in the factual allegations of the complaint from which the court can \ninfer that the lower payments affect the quality of the treatment and services received by Family \nCare beneficiaries so substantially that the rights of the plaintiffs under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act are implicated. \nNone of the named plaintiffs alleges that his or her own care or services have been \nsubstantially reduced.  They allege only that they may face the prospect of moving to different \ncommunity-based providers because their current providers are dissatisfied with their profits \nunder the rates which Family Care pays them.  The plaintiffs do not allege that the care they \n  5 \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 5 of 14   Document 69 \n\nwould receive if that occurs will be “substantially inferior” to the care they currently receive, and \nthere is no reason for the court to infer that it would be.  Nor does any named plaintiff allege that \nhe or she is receiving care or treatment which is substantially inferior to what he or she received \nwhen under age 60 as a beneficiary of a Medical Assistance waiver program.   The complaint \ndoes not describe the case of a single Family Care beneficiary who has suffered any injury \ncognizable under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act due to the “disparate treatment” alleged in \nParagraphs 143 and 162.     \nIn short, the claims of disparate treatment in Paragraphs 143 and 162 are mere \nunsupported conclusions and therefore insufficient to state a claim under conventional Rule 12(c) \nanalysis.  Moreover, even if they did state a claim, the Fourth Amended Complaint does not \nidentify any Family Care beneficiary who has the standing to raise it. \nC.  The integration mandate. \nThe Fourth Amended Complaint charges that the defendants administer Family Care in a \nfashion which violates the mandate, derived from both the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act and \ntheir respect implementing regulations, that disabled persons be served in the “most integrated” \n(that is, typically, the least institutional) setting appropriate to their needs. \nThe case law is clear that “unjustified institutional isolation” of disabled individuals \nreceiving care under the auspices of the state is actionable as a violation of the integration \nmandate of Title II of the ADA, Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), Radaszewski v. Maram, \n383 F.3d 599 (7th Cir. 2004).  However, none of the named plaintiffs is in “institutional \nisolation”, justified or otherwise.  They are all in community placements, thanks to Family Care \nfunding, and none has the standing to assert a claim under the integration mandate. \n  6 \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 6 of 14   Document 69 \n\nThe allegations of Fourth Amended Complaint which describe the named plaintiffs (Par. \n65-Par. 127) do not show any concrete “injury in fact” to the those plaintiffs, and certainly no \ninjury which implicates their rights under the integration mandates of the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act.  Viewing those allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, they \nestablish no more than conjectural or hypothetical injury. \nFour of the six named plaintiffs reside in CBRF’s run by the same business entity, Homes \nfor Independent Living (HIL).   HIL demanded higher rates from MCDA.  When MCDA \ndeclined,  HIL gave notice that it would cease doing business with MCDA, which forced MCDA \nto make other arrangements for the plaintiffs.  At length, due to interim stipulations, HIL agreed \nto keep those plaintiffs at the existing rates and it was not necessary to move them.  The other \nnamed plaintiffs are placed in a CBRF which, according the operator, is insufficiently profitable \nat the rates paid by the Family Care Program.  Therefore, if the program does not increase those \nrates, those plaintiffs may have to move because that operator will stop doing business with the \nFamily Care program.  The action has been pending for a year and a half, and that has not yet \nhappened.  \nThe worst thing that could  happen to the plaintiffs, even in the absence of the stipulation \nin this action, would be a move to a different CBRF, perhaps with different ancillary service \nproviders.  Significantly, it is not even alleged that MCDA plans to move any of the plaintiffs to \na “less integrated” nursing home or other institutional placement (in which event, the plaintiffs \nmight have an arguable claim under the integration mandates of the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct).    \nThe plaintiffs allege that any move would be so stressful as to result in a nursing home or \nsimilar institutional placement, but such conclusory allegations are “hypothetical” and \n  7 \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 7 of 14   Document 69 \n\n“conjectural” and therefore inadequate to confer standing.  Indeed, the allegations of the \ncomplaint itself tend to refute that proposition.  Plaintiff Bzdawka has been transferred to “a \nsuccession of group homes in Milwaukee County”, and then she was transferred from one HIL \nfacility to another (Fourth Amended Complaint, Par. 82).  Plaintiff Nelson was also transferred \nfrom one HIL CBRF to another HIL CBRF (Fourth Amended Complaint, Pars. 66-67).   Plaintiff \nGorton (one of the two plaintiffs not in HIL facility) was in “several assisted living facilities” \nbefore moving to his current placement.  In none of those cases did the moves result in nursing \nhome or other institutional placements.   The only inference which flows logically from the \nallegations of the complaint is that, for a variety of reasons, disabled persons move from one \nfacility or treatment provider to another (which, in fact, they do), and that those moves are not \ntypically so traumatic as to cause placement in less integrated institutional settings. \nThe substantive right which the plaintiffs are really asserting is a right to remain \nindefinitely, at state and county expense, in a particular CBRF with a particular array of \nadditional service providers, irrespective of cost or any other factor.  No such right exists under \nthe ADA or the Rehabilitation Act.  The law will not support federal court intervention to \nregulate the administration of a program for the disabled at that level of specificity.  “The \npurpose of the [integration mandate] regulation is not to constitute the federal courts the \nsupervisors of the care and treatment of disabled persons.  It is to prevent the isolation or \nsegregation of the disabled.”  Bruggeman v. Blagojevich, 324 F.3d 906, 911 (7th Cir. 2003). \nD.  Reasonable accommodation requirement. \nThis is not, as plaintiffs suggest, a “reasonable accommodation” case.  A “reasonable \naccommodation” is one that gives an otherwise qualified plaintiff with disabilities “meaningful \naccess” to a program or service.   Alexander v. Choate, 496 U.S. 287, 301 (1985).  That concept \n  8 \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 8 of 14   Document 69 \n\ncannot reasonably by applied to the operation of the Family Care program as it affects the \nplaintiffs in this case because the benefits of the Family Care program, insofar as they pertain to \nthe plaintiffs, are available only to the disabled, and the plaintiffs are currently receiving those \nbenefits.  The plaintiffs are arguing that they are entitled to a “reasonable accommodation” \nwhich would permit them to remain in the same CBRF forever, irrespective of cost or any other \nfactor.  Milwaukee County does not offer any program or service to the non-disabled, or to \nanyone, which guarantees perpetual placement in the same residential facility.  \nMoreover, even if the notion of “reasonable accommodation” were applicable in this \ncase, the defendants cannot be compelled to make that accommodation.  Under the ADA, a \npublic entity is not required to make an accommodation which “would fundamentally alter the \nnature of the service, program, or activity,” 28 CFR s. 35.130(b)(7).  Similarly, under the \nRehabilitation Act, a requested accommodation is not required if it “creates a fundamental \nalteration in the nature of the program” or creates “undue financial or administrative burdens” .\nThe essential and defining feature of the Family Care program is that it is a managed care \nprogram.   MCDA, in its capacity as the “care maintenance organization” administering the \nprogram, receives a capitated (per enrollee-per month) payment from the State of Wisconsin, and \nit is required to meet the identified needs of all eligible persons through the judicious purchase of \nresidential and support services and the like with that limited source of funds.  What the \nplaintiffs characterize as a “reasonable accommodation” would permit particular providers of \nresidential services to, in effect, extort higher rates from Milwaukee County by threatening to \nevict Family Care clients if those higher rates are not paid.  If the court empowers providers to \nengage in such conduct by forbidding the Family Care program to offer alternative appropriate \nresidential and support services on the theory there is a federal right under the ADA and \n  9 \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 9 of 14   Document 69 \n\nRehabilitation Act to remain in the same CBRF forever (which is, for the reasons discussed \nabove, a very doubtful proposition), the program’s ability to manage care and control costs \nwould be eliminated.    That would certainly “fundamentally alter” the nature of the program and \nwould create “undue financial or administrative burdens” within the meaning of the applicable \nregulations. \nThe Supreme Court has explicitly recognized that in reasonable accommodation cases (as \nin all cases of this kind), there is only so much money to go around.  Accordingly, the Court \nrefused to adopt an interpretation of the reasonable modifications regulation which “would leave \nthe State virtually defenseless once it is shown that the plaintiff is qualified for the service or \nprogram she seeks,” Olmstead, 527 U.S. 581 at p. 603.  Rather, the Court stated that, “[s]ensibly \nconstrued, the fundamental-alteration component of the reasonable-modifications regulation \nwould allow the State to show that, in the allocation of available resources, immediate relief for \nthe plaintiffs would be inequitable, given the responsibility the State has undertaken for the care \nand treatment of a large and diverse population” of persons with disabitilites”, id. \nThe goal of the Family Care program is to allocate the available resources as efficiently \nas possible in order to fund community placements for all eligible disabled persons for whom \nsuch placements are appropriate, as an alternative to leaving people in institutions on waiting \nlists (which, if properly administered, would be perfectly legal under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act, Bruggeman v. Blagojevich, 324 F.3d 906, 913 (7th Cir. 2003)).   To require \nthe Family Care program to pay whatever rates a particular CBRF or other provider which is \nserving a particular enrollee or group of enrollees may demand would permit those enrollees and \nproviders to absorb an inequitable share of the available resources.  In fact, it could delay or \n  10\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 10 of 14   Document 69 \n\neliminate the possibility of more integrated community placements for other eligible individuals, \nand thus frustrate the larger purpose or the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. \nIV.  Medicaid Act claims. \n  The Fourth Amended Complaint includes a claim under 42 U.S.C. s. 1396a(a)(30)(A), a \nsection of that portion of the federal Medicaid Act which prescribes the components of the \nmedical assistance plan which a state must have in order to participate in the Medicaid program.  \nThe plaintiffs allege that provider payments under the Family Care program are not “sufficient to \nenlist enough providers so that care and services are available under the plan at least to the extent \nthat such care and services are available to the general population in the geographical area,” \nwithin the meaning of that provision of the Act. \n  The complaint alleges that the plaintiffs have a private cause of action under s. (30)(A), \nenforceable under 42 U.S.C. s. 1983.  (Par. 182, Fourth Amended Complaint).  This is an \nunsupported legal conclusion which the court should not consider in assessing the viability of the \nclaim.  R.J.R. Serv., Inc. v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 895 F.2d 279, 281 (7th Cir. 1989).   Although \nthere is authority from other circuits allowing such a cause of action for Medicaid beneficiaries, \nsee, e.g., Evergreen Presbyterian Ministries Inc., v. Hood, 235 F.3d 908 (5th Cir. 2000), the \nSeventh Circuit Court of Appeals has not recognized such a cause of action3.   Even if such \nauthority would be found, it is not clear what the relevant “general population” or “geographical \narea” would be in this action. \n                                                \n3 Nor is there any reason to suppose the Seventh Circuit is in a hurry to create such a cause of action.  The court has \nshown a salutary reluctance to turn Medicaid state plan requirements into causes of action, see, Bruggeman v. \nBlagojevich, 324 F.3d 906, 911 (7th Cir. 2003), wherein the court refused to find a private cause of action in the \n“best interests” provision of 42 U.S.C. s. 1396a(a)(19), citing  “the Supreme Court’s hostility, most recently and \nemphatically expressed in Gonzaga University v.Doe, 536 U.S. 273 . . . to implying such rights in spending \nstatutes.”  \n  11\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 11 of 14   Document 69 \n\n  The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals has recognized a cause of action under s. (30)(A) \nin favor of Medicaid providers, Methodist Hospitals, Inc. v. Sullivan, 91 F.3d 1026, 1029 (7th \nCircuit).   However, the plaintiff providers in that case, although they had the theoretical basis \nfor a claim, were unsuccessful because they were unable to establish a violation of s. (30)(A).   \nBased upon the allegations in the Fourth Amended Complaint, the plaintiffs in this action would \nfail for the same reasons, even if they could assert a cognizable cause of action. \n  In Methodist Hospitals, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals held that a state does not \nviolate s. (30)(A) if it “behave[s] like other buyers of goods and services in the market place” in \nsetting Medicaid reimbursement rates.  A state can experiment with reimbursement methods and \nrates to test what the market will bear.  If an experiment fails and sufficient providers are not \nforthcoming, s. (30)(A) may require the state to raise the rates, but the experiment itself does not \nsubject the state to a private cause of action, id., 91 F.3d 1026 at 1030. \n  Based upon the allegations in the Fourth Amended Complaint, the impact of Family Care \nrates on the availability of CBRF’s and ancillary service providers for program beneficiaries has \nnot been sufficiently adverse to support a claim under s. (30)(A).  In dismissing the claims of the \nplaintiff providers in Methodist Hospitals, the court noted that the plaintiffs themselves had not \nwithdrawn from the market as a result of the challenged reimbursement system.  “Indeed, they \nhave not offered to show that any provider withdrew, anywhere in the state.”  The plaintiff \nproviders offered only  “dire predictions”, which did not come to pass, id., 91 F.3d 1026 at 1030.  \nThe allegations of the Fourth Amended Complaint are very similarly deficient.  The providers \nserving the named plaintiffs complain and threaten, but during the year and a half that this action \nhas been pending neither has stopped serving Family Care beneficiaries.  Indeed, like the \nunsuccessful provider plaintiffs in Methodist Hospitals, the plaintiffs in this action have alleged \n  12\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 12 of 14   Document 69 \n\nonly “dire predictions”.  As alleged in paragraphs 50 and 130 of the Fourth Amended Complaint, \nFamily Care has been operating since 2000 and serves nearly 5,700 enrollees, but the plaintiffs \nhave not offered to show that any provider has withdrawn from the program or that there has \nbeen any contraction in the relevant market for services which would suggest a violation of s. \n(30)(A).    \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons (together with the reasons which are cogently and persuasively \nargued in the brief of the State of Wisconsin defendants), Milwaukee County respectfully urges \nthe court to dismiss the Fourth Amended Complaint under Rule 12(c), on the grounds that the \nnamed plaintiffs do not state claims upon which relief can be granted because the claims as \nstated are not cognizable or, with regard to those sections of the complaint which may describe \nviable private causes of action, the plaintiffs lack the standing to raise them. \n  Dated at Milwaukee, Wisconsin this 15th day of June, 2005. \nOFFICE OF CORPORATION COUNSEL \n \nBy:___________________________________ \nJohn Jorgensen \nPrincipal Assistant Corporation Counsel \nState Bar No. 01017484 \nAttorneys for Defendant Milwaukee County \n \nP.O.

CERTIFICATION IS APPROPRIATE BECAUSE THE FEBRUARY 7, \n2006,  ORDER  FULFILLS  THE  CRITERIA  FOR  AN  IMMEDIATE \nAPPEAL REQUIRED BY 28 U.S.C. § 1292(B). \n  Four statutory criteria guide the Court’s decision whether to amend its February 7, 2006, \nOrder to include a statement certifying that interlocutory Order for appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1292(b).  There must be a question of law.  The question of law must be controlling.  The \ncontrolling question of law must be contestable.  And, resolution of that contestable, controlling \nquestion of law must promise to speed up the litigation.  Ahrenholz v. Board of Tr. of the Univ. of \nIllinois, 219 F.3d 674, 675 (7th Cir. 2000).  The State defendants’ request to certify the February \n7, 2006, order for appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) satisfies all those criteria, as discussed \nbelow and in the Defendants’ brief-in-chief (“Defendants’ brief”) [Docket 94].1 \nA.  A question of law is presented. \n  Although plaintiffs do not dispute that a question of law is involved, they argue that it “is \nnot a proper question of law for certification” (Plaintiff’s Brief in Opposition to Motion for \nCertification of Interlocutory Order and Motion for Stay Pending Appeal (“Plaintiffs’ brief”) at \n2) [Docket 103 at 2].  Plaintiffs’ argument depends on characterization of the standing issue \npresented as “enmeshed in the factual context” (Plaintiff’s brief at 3) [Docket 103 at 3].  That \ncharacterization is not correct, at this stage of the present litigation.  It also fails to recognize the \n“pure” legal nature of the standing issue involved in the State defendants’ certification request. \n                                                 \n  1 A fifth, non-statutory requirement also applies; a petition for 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) \ncertification must be filed in the district court within a reasonable time after the order sought to \nbe  appealed.    Plaintiffs’  brief  [Docket  103]  does  not challenge the timeliness of the State \ndefendants’ motion for § 1292(b) certification.  The State defendants therefore do not address the \nnon-statutory fifth requirement further in this reply brief. \n- 2 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 105     Filed 03/30/2006     Page 3 of 15(cid:10)\n  Plaintiffs correctly note Seventh Circuit case law characterizing a question of law, for \npurposes of 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) as “a question of the meaning of a statutory or constitutional \nprovision, regulation, or common law doctrine rather than . . . whether the party opposing \nsummary judgment had raised a genuine issue of material fact.”  Ahrenholz, 219 F.3d at 676.  Cf. \nPlaintiff’s brief at 2 [Docket 103 at 2].  As the Seventh Circuit has explained: \nWe think [the framers of § 1292(b)] used “question of law” in much the same way \na lay person might, as referring to a “pure” question of law rather than merely to \nan issue that might be free from a factual contest.  The idea was that if a case \nturned on a pure question of law, something the court of appeals could decide \nquickly  and  cleanly  without  having  to  study  the  record,  the  court  should  be \nenabled to do so without having to wait till the end of the case. \n \nAhrenholz, 219 F.3d at 676-77.  Cf. Plaintiffs’ brief at 2 [Docket 103 at 2]. \n  The State defendants request this Court’s 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) certification of a “pure” \nquestion  of  law:    the  meaning  of  the  common  law  doctrine  of  standing  in  the  factual \ncircumstances of this case.  That the question of law is framed by specific facts does not \nsomehow cause the question to become “enmeshed in the factual context.”  The standing issue is \nquite  discretely  framed:    whether  elderly  persons  with  disabilities  who  currently  reside  in \nparticular community living situations have standing to challenge a public funding mechanism \nthat they prospectively claim threatens that they might have to move from those particular \ncommunity living situations.  In other words, does standing exist in this specific factual context? \n Resolution of that pure issue of law requires no further resort to the record.  Consequently, the \nquestion of law cleanly presented in this case is very different from the types of legal questions \nAhrenholz  identifies  as  not  eligible  for  28  U.S.C.  §  1292(b)  certification—for  example, \nreviewing the entire record of summary judgment proceedings to determine whether a question of \nmaterial fact had been raised by the various filings of the parties.  Cf. Ahrenholz, 219 F.3d at 676. \n- 3 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 105     Filed 03/30/2006     Page 4 of 15(cid:10)\n Similarly, the discrete legal parameters of the standing issue presented in this case are easily \ndistinguished from a fact-intensive personal jurisdiction issue that would require reviewing the \nrecord to determine a party’s contacts with the jurisdiction, determining whether those contacts \ncount toward personal jurisdiction, assessing how much weight to give each of the contacts, and \ndeciding  whether  the  contacts  cumulatively  support  exercise  of  personal  jurisdiction.    Cf. \nShepherd Investments Int’l, Ltd. v. Verizon Communications, Inc., 2005 WL 1475323, *2  (E. D. \nWis. 2005). \n  In  fact,  the  Eighth  Circuit  recently  considered  very  similar  standing  issues  on \ninterlocutory appeal in Bill M. v. Nebraska Dep’t of Health and Human Svcs. Finance and \nSupport, 408 F.3d 1096 (8th Cir.), reh’g denied (2005).  Seven persons with developmental \ndisabilities had sued Nebraska and various state officials, alleging violations of the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act (“ADA”), the Rehabilitation Act (“RA”), and various other state and federal \nlaws.  The plaintiffs alleged that they had been denied home and community-based Medicaid-\nfunded services.  Among other things, the plaintiffs further alleged that Nebraska’s failure to \nfund those services left the plaintiffs at imminent risk of unnecessary institutionalization.  The \ndistrict court denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss on sovereign immunity grounds, and the \ndefendants took an interlocutory appeal on that issue.  Bill M., 408 F.3d at 1098. \n  Once on appeal, however, the Eighth Circuit sua sponte raised the issue of standing, \nexplaining that “it is elementary that standing relates to the justiciability of a case and cannot be \nwaived by the parties.”  Bill M., 408 F.3d at 1098 n.1.  That the Eighth Circuit sua sponte found \nit necessary to raise and address standing, even though that was not the issue on which the \ndefendants’ interlocutory appeal had been taken, forcefully demonstrates the appropriateness—\nindeed, necessity—of allowing interlocutory appeal on standing issues. \n- 4 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 105     Filed 03/30/2006     Page 5 of 15(cid:10)\n  Furthermore, of special relevance to the standing issue presented in the instant case, the \nEighth Circuit found that the “mere risk that Plaintiffs might be institutionalized due to the lack \nof adequate funding does not constitute an actual or imminent harm sufficient to satisfy the first \nelement of standing.”  Bill M., 408 F.3d at 1099.  Certainly the factual framework of the standing \nissues presented in Bill M. was no more complicated than that of the standing issue presented in \nthe present case.  Bill M. therefore teaches that not only is this type of standing issue a question \nof law appropriate for consideration on interlocutory appeal, it is the type of threshold issue that \nshould be considered on interlocutory appeal. \nB.  The question of law is controlling. \n  Plaintiffs summarily dismiss the significance of this factor, arguing that it alone cannot \njustify granting interlocutory appeal but not addressing it on the merits.  In fact, they characterize \nthis factor as “immaterial” to resolution of the State defendants’ certification request.  Plaintiffs’ \nbrief at 7 [Docket 103 at 7].  Because the question of standing is so central to justiciability of this \ncase, however, the controlling nature of the issue not only is material and must be considered—it \nalso weighs heavily in favor of certifying the February 7, 2006, Order for interlocutory appeal. \n  “[I]f resolution of the issue being challenged on appeal will terminate the action in the \ndistrict court, it is clearly controlling.  Controlling questions of law that fall within this category \nof dispositive issues include . . . questions as to . . . standing to maintain the action.”  19 James \nWm. Moore et al., Moore’s Federal Practice § 203.31[2], at 203-87 – 203-90 & n.9 (3d ed. \n2005),  citing  Schact  v.  Brown,  711  F.2d  1343,  1344  (7th  Cir.  1983)  (interlocutory  appeal \ncertified; controlling question of law as to whether plaintiff may sue for the type of injury \nalleged). \n- 5 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 105     Filed 03/30/2006     Page 6 of 15(cid:10)\n  Other courts are solidly in accord on this issue.  See, e.g., Klapper v. Commonwealth \nRealty Trust, 662 F. Supp. 2345, 236 (D. Del. 1987) (standing is a controlling question of law; if \nplaintiffs have no standing, the litigation will terminate and such questions are particularly well \nsuited for an interlocutory appeal); APCC Services, Inc. v. AT&T Corp., 287 F. Supp. 2d 101, \n105 (D.D.C. 2003) (controlling question of law is one that would require reversal if decided \nincorrectly or that could materially affect the course of litigation with resulting savings of the \ncourt’s or the parties’ resources), citing United States ex rel. Wisconsin. v. Dean, 729 F.2d 1100, \n1103 (7th Cir. 1984) (subject matter jurisdiction involves a controlling question of law); Forest \nGuardians v. Bureau of Land Mgt., 188 F.R.D. 389, 396 (D.N.M. 1999) (standing is a controlling \nquestion of law).   That standing presents a controlling issue of law is further demonstrated by \ncomparison with issues of law that are collateral, rather than controlling.  See, e.g., Stout v. \nIllinois Farmers Ins. Co., 882 F. Supp. 776, 778 (S.D. Ind. 1994) (controlling issue of law is a \nthreshold issue seriously impacting the way that the court conducts the litigation, such as whether \nor not the plaintiff has a cause of action; discovery issue concerning documents to which litigant \nwill have access in building his or her case is not a controlling issue of law). \n  Furthermore,  the  impact  that  the  interlocutory  appeal  will  have  on  other  cases  also \nsupports a conclusion that a question of law is controlling.  APCC Services, 287 F. Supp. 2d at \n105, citing Brown v. Bullock, 294 F.2d, 415, 417 (2d Cir. 1961) (leave to appeal granted in part \nbecause determination was likely to have precedential value for large number of other suits).  \nThis  Court’s  February  7,  2006,  Order  cited  no  other  case  finding  standing  to  exist  in \ncircumstances  closely  related  to  the  present  case.   Cf. Order at 6-10 [Docket 86 at 6-10].  \nPlaintiffs now have acquired institutional co-counsel with a national practice.  See Notice of \nAppearance  and  Declarations  of  Attorneys  Sarah  Jane  Somers and M. Jane Perkins of the \n- 6 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 105     Filed 03/30/2006     Page 7 of 15(cid:10)\nNational Health Law Program, Inc. [Docket 97-99].  Resolution of the standing issue presented \nin  this  case  undoubtedly  will  affect  the  filing  and  resolution  of  similar  lawsuits  in  other \njurisdictions.   \n  For  all  these  reasons,  the  issue  of  plaintiffs’  standing  to  sue  presents  a  controlling \nquestion of law weighing in favor of the State defendants’ certification request. \nC.  The controlling question of law is contestable. \n  Plaintiffs argue that the standing issue presented by the State defendants’ 28 U.S.C. § \n1292(b) certification request is not contestable (Plaintiffs’ brief at 4-5) [Docket 103 at 4-5].  \nTheir argument is premised on selective interpretation of the cases cited in support and failure to \nacknowledge applicable Eastern District of Wisconsin and Seventh Circuit precedent. \n  In the Seventh Circuit, the “controlling question of law” requirement is interpreted with \nflexibility.  Johnson v. Burken, 930 F.2d 1202, 1205-06 (7th Cir. 1991).  A question of law may \nbe  deemed  controlling  if  its  resolution  quite  likely  would  affect  the  further  course  of  the \nlitigation.  Sokaogon Gaming Enter. Corp. v. Tushie-Montgomery Assocs., Inc., 86 F.3d 656, 659 \n(7th Cir. 1996). \n  First, plaintiffs complain that the State defendants have not identified any opinion or \nother authority that conflicts with the February 7 Order—including the case cited in the State \ndefendants’ brief in chief, Tobin for Governor v. Illinois State Bd. of Elec., 268 F.3d 517 (7th \nCir. 2001).  Cf. Plaintiffs’ brief at 4 [Docket 103 at 4].  However, the legal principle for which \nthe State defendants rely on Tobin—that speculation is insufficient to establish the standing \nrequirement  of  injury-in-fact—clearly  conflicts  with  the  February  7  Order,  which  cites  no \ncontrary case law on that point of law.  See Defendants’ brief at 5 [Docket 94 at 5]; cf. February \n7, 2006, Order at 8-9 [Docket 86 at 8-9]. \n- 7 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 105     Filed 03/30/2006     Page 8 of 15(cid:10)\n  Second, plaintiffs assert that a case cited in the February 7 Order on a different standing \nrequirement—causation—supports the Court’s conclusion that standing exists.  Cf. Plaintiffs’ \nbrief at 4-5, citing Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154 (1997) [Docket 103 at 4-5].  Bennett involved \nan entirely different aspect of standing from the present case:  whether those petitioners had a \nsufficient interest in an environmental regulatory matter to obtain standing.  See Bennett, 520 \nU.S. at 161-66.  Insufficiency of speculation to establish injury-in-fact simply was not involved \nin Bennett.  Moreover, Bennett comes nowhere near addressing the theory underlying Plaintiffs’ \nentire brief, that the interest of plaintiffs that is protected under the ADA and RA is the interest in \nnot moving, rather than the interest in residing in the most integrated setting and otherwise in \nreceiving services in a non-discriminatory manner.  Throughout the plaintiffs' argument it is clear \nthat they premise their standing argument on the threat of having to move in and of itself.  No \nissue anything like that appears anywhere in Bennett.  \n  Third, plaintiffs claim that lack of precedent is immaterial to the contestability of a \ncontrolling issue of law (Plaintiffs’ brief at 5-6) [Docket 103 at 5-6].  That is incorrect.   Finding \nthe existence of a substantial difference of opinion is warranted when there is no authority in the \npresent jurisdiction, but there exists a unanimous decision from an appellate court in another \ncircuit on the same issue.  APCC Services, 297 F. Supp. 2d at 108.  Given the Eighth Circuit’s \nrecent Bill M. decision, discussed above, that is precisely the situation that exists in this case with \nrespect to the standing issue presented in this case.  There is no Seventh Circuit precedent \ndirectly  on  point  in  similar factual circumstances, but there is a unanimous Eighth Circuit \ndecision almost on all fours with the facts of the present case.  See also Boim v. Quranic Literacy \nInst. and Holy Land Found. for Relief and Dev., 291 F.3d 1000, 1007-08 (7th Cir. 2002) \n- 8 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 105     Filed 03/30/2006     Page 9 of 15(cid:10)\n(application of statues to facts alleged presents question of law of first impression that is certainly \ncontestable). \n    Finally, plaintiffs argue that a party seeking 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) certification must show \na substantial likelihood of reversal on appeal (Plaintiffs’ brief at 5-6) [Docket 103 at 5-6].  The \nState defendants submit that lack of authority supporting the February 7 order on the aspect of \nstanding at issue in this case, as well as the Bill M. decision, sufficiently establish substantial \nlikelihood of reversal on appeal.  Moreover, the cases cited by plaintiffs in support of this \nargument do not involve issues of standing.  Boese v. Paramount Pictures Corp., 952 F. Supp. \n550  (N.D.  Ill.  1996)  involves  a  post-summary  judgment  request  for  28  U.S.C.  §  1292(b) \ncertification on whether statements attributed to those defendants were defamatory per se and \ncast  those  plaintiffs  in  a  bad  light.    See  Boese,  952  F.  Supp.  at  553,  560-61.    In  re \nBridgestone/Firestone, Inc., Tires Products Liability Litigation, 212 F. Supp. 2d 903 (S.D. Ind. \n2002) involved various choice of forum and choice of law issues.  See Bridgestone/Firestone, \n212 F. Supp. 2d at 905-06.  Cf. Plaintiffs’ brief at 5 [Docket 103 at 5]. \n  Furthermore,  Bridgestone/Firestone expressly noted that the standard in that Indiana \ndistrict court for existence of a contestable issue differed from that of the Eastern District of \nWisconsin. The Bridgestone/Firestone court quoted Stong v. Bucyrus-Erie Co., 476 F. Supp. \n224, 225 (E.D. Wis. 1979), for the proposition that the contestable issue criteria is satisfied when \n“‘a  reasonable  appellate  judge  could  vote  for  reversal  of  the  challenged  order.’”  \nBridgestone/Firestone, 212 F. Supp. 2d at 909.  The Bridgestone/Firestone court then went on to \napply a more stringent standard akin to that advocated by the plaintiffs in this case.  Id. at 909-10. \n Stong is the law in this district—not Bridgestone/Firestone.  Given the lack of controlling \n- 9 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 105     Filed 03/30/2006     Page 10 of 15(cid:10)\nSeventh Circuit authority and the inconsistent Bill M. decision, a reasonable appellate judge \ncertainly could vote for reversal of the Court’s February 7 order on standing.  \nD.  Resolution  of  the  standing  issue  in  an  interlocutory  appeal \npromises to speed up the litigation. \n  Plaintiffs’ argument that certifying the standing issue pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) “is \nhighly unlikely to expedite the litigation” ignores both the purpose of § 1292(b)  interlocutory \nappeals and the threshold nature of the standing question now at issue in this case.  Cf. Plaintiffs’ \nbrief at 6. \n  As explained in the Defendants’ brief at 6-7 [Docket at 6-7], reversal of the Court’s \nFebruary 7 Order on standing would conclude this case entirely and the primary purpose of a § \n1292(b) interlocutory appeal is to materially advance ultimate termination of the litigation.  See \nFisons Ltd. v. United States, 458 F.2d 1241, 1245 (7th Cir. 1972).  Instead of addressing the \ncentrality of plaintiffs’ standing to justiciability of the entire remaining case or the purpose of § \n1292(b) interlocutory appeals, plaintiffs make an emotional appeal based on alleged facts not of \nrecord and sheer speculation (Plaintiffs’ brief at 6-7) [Docket 103 at 6-7].  \n  That is not the legal test, however.  Immediate review would materially advance the \nultimate termination of this litigation if the Seventh Circuit reversed this Court’s ruling on \nstanding, which would dispose of the case and no further proceedings would be necessary.  \nStong, 476 F. Supp. at 225.  Appeal now would conserve judicial resources and spare the parties \nfrom needless expense if it should turn out that this Court’s rulings are reversed.  In the event \nthat plaintiffs ultimately are found to lack standing, it would be far better for all concerned—\nincluding plaintiffs—to have these matters resolved now as opposed to some time in the distant \nfuture.  APCC Services, 297 F. Supp. 2d at 109.  See also Wieboldt Stores, Inc. v. Schottenstein \n- 10 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 105     Filed 03/30/2006     Page 11 of 15(cid:10)\nStores Corporation, 1989 WL 51068, *2 (N.D. Ill. May 5, 1989) (interlocutory appeal would \nmaterially advance the termination of the litigation if it “might preclude wasteful and time-\nconsuming discovery as well as a lengthy and complex trial”); Katz v. Carte Blanche Corp., 496 \nF.2d  747,  753  (3d  Cir.  1974)  (“Section  1292(b)  was  the  result  of  dissatisfaction  with  the \nprolongation  of  litigation  and  with  harm  to  litigants  uncorrectable  on  appeal  from  a  final \njudgment.”); Klapper v. Commonwealth Realty Trust, 662 F. Supp. 2345, 236 (D. Del. 1987) (if \nplaintiffs have no standing, the litigation will be terminated and that satisfies the test that an \nimmediate appeal may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation). \n  In this case, plaintiffs propose to mount a complicated class action lawsuit involving \nmassive, expensive discovery activities including retention of expert witnesses and preparation of \nactuarial analyses.  The State defendants do not have unlimited litigation resources, or unlimited \nresources, period.  Eventual reversal on appeal of the standing rulings set forth in this Court’s \nFebruary 7 Order would needlessly waste scarce state resources that would have to be committed \nto discovery and other immediate litigation activities if interlocutory appeal is not permitted for \nreview of the plaintiffs’ very questionable standing to pursue the prospective relief they seek in \nthis lawsuit. \nII.  STAY  OF  PROCEEDINGS  IN  THIS  COURT  IS  NECESSARY  TO \nACHIEVE  THE  PURPOSES  OF  THE  INTERLOCUTORY  APPEAL, \nESPECIALLY  SINCE  PLAINTIFFS  OFFER  NO  PROOF  OF  ANY \nACTUAL OR EVEN IMMINENT HARM.  \n  Because resolution of the standing issue in the State defendants’ favor will terminate this \nlitigation, they have asked this Court to stay litigation of this case pending resolution of their \ninterlocutory appeal by the court of appeals.  Motion for Stay Pending Appeal [Docket 95].  \nOpposing that stay, plaintiffs have identified only general principles of law and advanced the \n- 11 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 105     Filed 03/30/2006     Page 12 of 15(cid:10)\ntotally unsupported allegation that “the plight of the individual Plaintiffs is getting worse along \nwith the magnitude of the rate dispute” (Plaintiffs’ brief at 8) [Docket 8].  The problem with \nplaintiffs’ position on whether a stay should be granted is the same problem that undermines their \nwhole standing argument—they have not shown any proof of actual or imminent harm either to \nthemselves  or  any  potential  class  member  on  account  of  the  Family  Care  operations  they \nchallenge, and their attempts to conjure up prospective harm are totally speculative.  There \nsimply is no evidence that the “plight” of any plaintiff or prospective plaintiff is “getting worse.” \n Cf. Plaintiffs’ brief at 8 [Docket 103 at 8].  What was submitted to the Court in support of the \nState defendants’ motion to dismiss and is part of the record is the CMO contract requiring \nMilwaukee County to provide services in the most integrated setting, even if the plaintiffs’ \nproviders were to follow thorough on their threats to discharge plaintiffs.  The harm against \nwhich applicable laws protect plaintiffs is against discrimination based on disability, not against \npotentially having to move or provide service providers. \n  Nevertheless,  the  plaintiffs  ask  this  Court  to  deny  the  stay  requested  by  the  State \ndefendants with the consequential effect that burdensome and expensive class certification and \ndiscovery activities proceed forward.  It is the State defendants, not the plaintiffs, who will bear \nthe burden of these activities in disruption of the regular program activities of state personnel and \ndiversion  of  scarce  resources  from  program  administration.    The  whole  point  of  the  State \ndefendants’ request for § 1292(b) certification is that the burden of this litigation should not be \nimposed on the State defendants until the issue of plaintiffs’ highly questionable standing is \nresolved.  Granting § 1292(b) certification but denying a stay would have the practical effect of \nactually increasing the State defendants’ litigation burdens by requiring them to go forward with \nclass certification, discovery and other activities in this Court while at the same time litigating a \n- 12 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 105     Filed 03/30/2006     Page 13 of 15(cid:10)\npotentially dispositive appeal in the Seventh Circuit.  Substantially more is at stake for the State \ndefendants than “[a]dministrative efficiency” if litigation in this Court is not stayed pending \ninterlocutory appeal of plaintiffs’ standing.  Cf. Plaintiffs’ brief at 7 [Docket 103 at 7]. \n  The burdensomeness of requiring the State defendants to proceed with litigation in this \nCourt during the pendency of an interlocutory appeal easily distinguishes this case from the \nauthorities upon which plaintiffs cursorily rely.  In Reed v. Rhodes, 549 F.2d 1050, 1051 (6th Cir. \n1976), denying a stay pending interlocutory appeal simply required those defendants to cooperate \nwith development of a remedial plan addressing racially segregated conditions in the Cleveland \nSchools.  As the Sixth Circuit explained, “The restraints placed upon defendants by the district \ncourt’s order are neither severe nor costly.  The order does not compel defendants to perform any \nparticular act, except to participate in the formulation of a remedial plan.”  Id.  That is a very \ndifferent situation from the present case, where denying the State defendants’ request for a stay \nwill require participate in intensive, expensive litigation activities.  Cf. Plaintiffs’ brief at 7-8 \n[Docket 103 at 7-8]. \n  Even worse, in Powell v. National Football League, 711 F. Supp. 959, 961 (D. Minn. \n1989), a stay was denied for reasons that are totally unexplained other than a cursory statement \nthat  the  “potential  harm  to  plaintiffs  in  further  delaying  resolution  of  its  antitrust  claims \noutweighs any benefit that may be gained by awaiting the Court of Appeals’ decision.”  Id. at \n962.  In that case, however, a number of previous district court decisions already had resolved \nmany controlling issues.  Id. at 961.  Unlike the present case, Powell did not involve threshold \nand potentially dispositive issues like whether the plaintiffs had any standing at all to pursue the \nlawsuit.  Cf. Plaintiffs’ brief at 7-8 [Docket 103 at 7-8]. \n- 13 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 105     Filed 03/30/2006     Page 14 of 15(cid:10)\n  What the plaintiffs have offered in support of their dire assertions that their plight is \ngetting worse appears to be one newspaper article and bald speculation about the consequences \nof one procedural development reported in that article.  Cf. Plaintiffs’ brief at 7-8 [Docket 103 at \n7-8].  Quite clearly, the Court has not been provided with “the rest of the story.”  Given the lack \nof  any  actual  evidence  of  the  imminent  harms  alleged  by  the  plaintiffs,  in  order  to  avoid \nundermining the very purpose for which the State defendants are pursuing an interlocutory appeal \nthis Court should stay further proceedings in the case at least until it is determined whether the \ninterlocutory  appeal  will  proceed  in  the  Seventh  Circuit  and,  after  that,  until  plaintiffs \ndemonstrate that their claims of alleged harm are something more than doomsday warnings based \non pure speculation. \n  Finally, plaintiffs do not address the well-established criteria for stay pending appeal.  A \nparty seeking a stay pending appeal must show a likelihood of success on the merits, that \nirreparable harm will occur if a stay is not granted, that the potential harm to the movant \noutweighs the harm to the opposing party if a stay is not granted, and that granting the stay would \nserve the public interest.  Sofinet v. Immigration and Naturalization Serv., 188 F.3d 703 (7th Cir. \n1999).  These factors are not prerequisites, but rather interrelated considerations that must be \nbalanced together.  Michigan Coal. of Radioactive Material Users, inc. v, Griepentrog, 945 F.2d \n150, 153 (6th Cir. 1991), rev’d on other grounds, 954 F.2d 1174 (6th Cir. 1992).  The State \ndefendants have demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits, for the reasons \nexplained in Section I.C. above.  Potential harm to the State defendants if a stay is not granted is \nclosely intertwined with the public interest.  As explained above in this Section II, the State \ndefendants should not be forced to expend their finite resources litigating complicated legal \nissues until plaintiffs’ questionable standing to pursue those issues is resolved.  Plaintiffs have \n- 14 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 105     Filed 03/30/2006     Page 15 of 15(cid:10)\noffered no evidence of any real harm if stay is granted, only speculation based on a questionable \nlegal  theory  strenuously  disputed  by  the  State  defendants.    Balancing  these  interrelated \nconsiderations together under the current circumstances of this case heavily weighs in favor of \nstaying district court litigation pending interlocutory appeal of plaintiffs’ standing in this lawsuit. \nCONCLUSION \n  For the reasons discussed above, the State defendants respectfully renew their request for \ncertification from this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) to seek review by the court of \nappeals of the interlocutory Order of February 7, 2006.  The State defendants also respectfully \nrenew request their request for stay of further litigation of this case pending resolution of the \ninterlocutory appeal by the court of appeals. \n  Dated this 30th day of March, 2006. \n  PEGGY A.

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN \n \n \nGERALD NELSON, by his legal guardian and next \nfriend, JANE PRENTICE; JOAN BZDAWKA, by \nher legal guardian and next friend, RICHARD \nMILLER; SANDRA EHRLICHMAN, by her legal \nguardian and next friend, NANCY STEEVES; \nMARILYN BERDIKOFF, by her legal guardian and \nnext friend, LOIS DEGNER; LENORE \nCZARNECKI, by her agent and next friend, \nCAROLYN CETNAROWSKI; and JOHN \nGORTON, by his agent and next friend, \nDEBORAK BRUNK, each on their own behalf and \non behalf of a class of persons similarly situated,   \n \nPlaintiffs, \n \nv.            Case No. 04-C-0193 \n \nMILWAUKEE COUNTY; WISCONSIN \nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND FAMILY \nSERVICES; and HELENE NELSON, in her official \ncapacity as Secretary of DHFS, \n \nDefendants. \n \n \nSTATE DEFENDANTS’ BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF MOTIONS TO DISMISS \nFOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n  This is an action for declaratory, injunctive and retroactive monetary relief based on the \nAmericans  with  Disabilities  Act  (“ADA”),  42  U.S.C.  §  12101,  et  seq.,  and  §  504  of  the \nRehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794; together with a statutory civil rights claim, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983,  based  on  the  federal  Medical  Assistance  (“MA”  or  “Medicaid”)  statute, \n§ 1396a(a)(30)(A).  Plaintiffs claim that their rights under the ADA, Rehabilitation Act and \nMedicaid statute, § 1396a(a)(30)(a) (“(a)(30)(A)”), are being violated by the manner in which the \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 1 of 46   Document 71 \n\nState of Wisconsin and Milwaukee County administer Family Care, a statutory Wisconsin MA \nwaiver program designed to serve physically and developmentally disabled persons and the \nelderly.  Family Care is now operating in a limited number of Wisconsin counties, including \nMilwaukee County, and is designed to provide long-term community-based managed care to \ncovered  individuals  who  choose  to  enroll  in  the  county  “care  management  organization” \n(“CMO”).  Plaintiffs, six individual recipients of Family Care in Milwaukee County and their \nguardians or authorized representatives, currently assert nine counts on behalf of themselves and \na  putative  class.    The  primary  focus  of  plaintiffs’  claims  is  the  allegedly  inadequate  per \nmember-per  month  (or  “capitated”)  rates  paid  by  the  State  to  the  Milwaukee  CMO  and \nMilwaukee  County’s  attempts  to  limit  the  contracted  rates  it  pays  to  providers  of  certain \nresidential and day program services to the plaintiffs and the class they seek to represent.   \n  The defendants include Milwaukee County, which administers the Milwaukee County \nCMO; the Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services (“DHFS”), which administers \nthe Wisconsin Medical Assistance program, including Family Care; and Helene Nelson, the \nDHFS Secretary, sued in her official capacity (collectively, the “State defendants”).  After filing \nanswers  incorporating  grounds  for  dismissal  as  defenses,  both  the  County  and  the  State \ndefendants have formally moved to dismiss the Fourth Amended Complaint.  This brief is \nsubmitted in support of the State Defendants’ Motions to Dismiss. \nQUESTIONS PRESENTED \n  1.  Must certain counts be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because the plaintiffs \nlack standing or because particular claims are not ripe for adjudication? \n- 2 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 2 of 46   Document 71 \n\n  2.  Must plaintiffs’ claim for retroactive declaratory and monetary relief against the \nState defendants be dismissed because, with the exception of the Rehabilitation Act, such relief \nis barred based on sovereign immunity and the Eleventh Amendment to the U.S. Constitution? \n  3.  Must the complaint be dismissed because the nine assorted counts fail to state \nclaims on which relief can be granted, F.R.C.P. 12(b)(6) and 12(c)?   \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n  Family Care is a managed care MA waiver program currently operated by DHFS as a \npilot program through which elderly persons with long-term care needs and adults who have \nphysical or developmental disabilities may receive comprehensive community-based services.1  \nServices available under Family Care include both some of the services that would otherwise be \nprovided  under  Wisconsin’s  regular  State  Medicaid  Plan,  as  well  as  services  that  would \notherwise be available only under a Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) Waiver \nobtained from the federal government under § 1915(c) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396n(c).2 \n                                                 \n  1General descriptive information regarding Family Care is available on the DHFS website \nat  http://dhfs.wisconsin.gov/LTCare/Generalinfo/Index.htm  (Exhibit  2001*).  *As more fully \ndescribed later in this brief, the State defendants request that the Court take judicial notice of \nbasic documentary materials related to the Family Care waiver that are posted on the DHFS \nwebsite.  Hard copies of the documents have been marked as exhibits and are being mailed to the \nCourt and other counsel simultaneously with the filing of this brief.  An index to these exhibits is \nattached to this brief as well. \n \n  2For a complete listing of long-term care services provided through Family Care, see the \nHealth and Community Supports Contract for 2005 (“the CMO Contract”) at pp. 15-16, available \non the DHFS website at: http://dhfs.wisconsin.gov/LTCare/StateFedReqs/CY05HCSContract.pdf \n(Exhibit 2002). \n \n- 3 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 3 of 46   Document 71 \n\nFamily  Care  is  authorized  by  federal  Medicaid  authorities  pursuant to two types of \nwaivers,3 and an approved prepaid health plan that authorizes DHFS to contract for State Plan \nlong-term care services on a prepaid basis.4 The waivers permit Wisconsin to deliver services in \na manner that is exempt from some otherwise-applicable federal Medicaid requirements. One \ntype of waiver, the HCBS or “1915(c)” waiver, permits Wisconsin to use federal Medicaid funds \nfor HCBS services instead of only institutional care for people who would qualify for Medicaid \nin a nursing home. See 42 USC §1396n(c). The other type of waiver, the managed care or \n“1915(b)” waiver, permits Wisconsin to limit the services in the Family Care benefit to people \nwho enroll in a CMO. This waiver also limits participants’ freedom of choice of provider. See \n42 USC §1396n(b) (“Waivers to promote cost-effectiveness and efficiency”). \nFamily  Care  is  currently  being  operated  on  a  pilot  basis  in  several  counties.5    In \nMilwaukee County, Family Care is available only for elderly individuals (60 years of age and \nolder), including those with physical disabilities and those with developmental disabilities. In \nother counties in which Family Care is operating, it is available for elderly individuals and adults \n                                                 \n  3The waiver applications and terms and conditions of approval are available on the DHFS \nwebsite  at:  http://dhfs.wisconsin.gov/LTCare/Waiver/Index.htm  (see  Exhibit  2003,  which \nincludes some of the primary materials marked as Ex. 2003-A through 2003-D(3)). \n \n  4The federal government approves DHFS’ contracts with CMOs as Prepaid Health Plans. \nSee n.2, CMO contract, p. 121, ¶ (18), (Ex. 2002).  See also June 1, 2001, waiver approval letter \nfrom  Center  for  Medicaid  and  State  Operations,  ¶  1,  available  on  the  DHFS  website  at \nhttp://dhfs.wisconsin.gov/LTCare/Waiver/HCFAApprovalLetter-1915b.pdf (Ex. 2003-D(1)). \n \n  5See  “Wisconsin  Family  Care  Counties,”  a  map  posted  on  the  DHFS  website  at: \nhttp://dhfs.wisconsin.gov/LTCare/Generalinfo/FCMap.htm (Ex. 2004). \n \n- 4 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 4 of 46   Document 71 \n\nof any age with physical or developmental disabilities.6  (In Milwaukee County, physically or \ndevelopmentally disabled persons under the age of 60 continue to receive community-based long \nterm care services  via pre-existing HCBS waivers, including the Community Options Program \n(“COP”) waiver, Community Integration Program (“CIP”) and Brain Injury (“BI”) waivers.  See \nAm. Comp. ¶ 32.) \nOrganizationally, Family Care consists of two components in each county in which the \nprogram is fully implemented:  an aging and disability resource center (“resource center”) and a \nCMO.  See Wis.Stat. §§ 46.283 and 46.284.7  \nThe resource center provides information to elderly people and people with disabilities \nabout resources available to them in their local communities, Wis. Stat. § 46.283(4)(e).  An \nindividual who wants to receive long-term care services through the Family Care program is \nscreened for eligibility by the resource center and the county Economic Support unit.  Wis. Stat. \n§ 46.283(4)(f) and (g).  If the individual is eligible and is considering enrollment, the person is \ncontacted by an independent “enrollment consultant” who determines whether the person is \nmaking an informed decision to enroll in the CMO. The CMO has no part in the eligibility or \nenrollment decision. \nThe CMO manages and delivers the Family Care benefit. Wis. Stat. § 46.284. After a \nparticipant enrolls, the CMO assesses the participant’s needs for health care and long-term care \n                                                 \n  6See June 1, 2001, waiver approval letter from Center for Medicaid and State Operations, \npar.  1,  available  on  the  DHFS  website  at: \nhttp://dhfs.wisconsin.gov/LTCare/Waiver/HCFAApprovalLetter-1915b.pdf  (Ex. 2003-D(1)). \n \n  7See also “Family Care Program Operations Information” posted on the DHFS website at: \nhttp://dhfs.wisconsin.gov/LTCare/ProgramOps/Index.htm (Ex. 2005). \n \n- 5 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 5 of 46   Document 71 \n\nservices, Wis. Stat. § 46.284(4)(b).8  The CMO delivers those services in the Family Care benefit \npackage that are identified as necessary to meet the individual’s long-term care needs through the \nCMO’s network of providers, Wis. Stat. § 46.284(4)(d).9  A contract between DHFS and the \nCMO requires that the CMO, in exchange for the capitated payments, manage and provide a \ncombination of HCBS waiver services and long-term care Medicaid State Plan services.  In \nMilwaukee County, the CMO is the Milwaukee County Department on Aging (“MCDA”).10  \nA CMO enrollee has a right to a contested case hearing to challenge certain actions or \ninactions on the part of the CMO. These include failure to provide timely services included in the \nenrollee’s care plan, reduction of such services, or a care plan that requires the enrollee to live in \na place unacceptable to the enrollee.11 \nSeveral important features of Family Care distinguish it from the Medicaid State Plan and \nthe HCBS Waivers: \n•  Family Care pays on a capitated12 rather than a fee-for-service basis. Under both the State \nPlan and traditional HCBS Waivers, providers are usually paid on a “fee-for-service” \n                                                 \n  8See also n.2, CMO contract at pp. 30 et seq., (Ex. 2002). \n \n  9See n.2, CMO Contract at p. 15 et seq., (Ex. 2002) \n \n  10See  “Resource  Center  and  CMO  Contacts,”  posted  on  the  DHFS  website  at: \nhttp://dhfs.wisconsin.gov/LTCare/Generalinfo/Where.htm (Ex. 2006). \n \n  11See CMO contract at 54-55, (Ex. 2002). \n \n  12“Capitation refers to the prospective payment of a fixed sum per period for each patient \nunder the care of a selected provider, regardless of the actual costs incurred by the provider in \ntreating the patient.”  Andrew Ruskin, “Capitation: The Legal Implications of Using Capitation \nto Affect Physician Decision-Making Processes,” 13 J. Contemp. Health L. & Policy 391 (Spring \n1997).  See also Gary R. Ilminen, Consumer Guide to Long-Term Care (Madison, WI 1999) \nat 49 (capitation is “[t]he practice in managed care of paying a fixed amount to a provider or \nentity to cover the cost of providing care to members of a health plan for a set period of time”). \n- 6 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 6 of 46   Document 71 \n\nbasis:    the  provider  renders  a  service  to  a  Medicaid  recipient,  submits  a  claim  to \nMedicaid, and is paid at a pre-established rate for the service.  In contrast, under Family \nCare, the CMO agrees by contract with the State Medicaid Program to provide the \nservices  from  the  Family  Care  benefit package that most cost-effectively meet each \nparticipant’s assessed long-term care needs, in exchange for a capitated, per member-per \nmonth payment from the State Medicaid Program.  Wis. Stat. §§ 46.28(4)(d) and (5). \n•  Under applicable federal regulations, DHFS is required to set these capitated payment \nrates at a level that is “actuarially sound,” subject to annual review and approval by the \nCenters  for  Medicare  and  Medicaid  Services  (“CMS”),  see  42  CFR  §§  438.1(a)(1) \nand 438.6(c)(2). The capitated rates paid to the CMOs by DHFS have increased at an \naverage  of  more  than  8  percent  each  year,  ranging  from  $1,466.64  in  CY  2000  to \n$2,055.01 in CY 2005 in Milwaukee County for enrollees at the comprehensive level.13 \nThe rates are developed by an actuarial firm under contract with DHFS.14 \n•  Family Care is a Medicaid entitlement program. Unlike other HCBS waiver programs \n(COP, CIP and BI), an individual who is eligible for Medicaid and is functionally eligible \nfor Family Care may not be placed on a waiting list to await either participation in the \nprogram or receipt of any part of the services for which the individual has an assessed \nneed.  Wis. Stat. § 46.286(3)(a).  A Family Care CMO is required to provide all services \n                                                 \n  13See “Family Care CMO Capitation Rates,” 2000-2005, posted on the DHFS website at: \nhttp://dhfs.wisconsin.gov/LTCare/StateFedReqs/CapitationRates.htm (Ex. 2007). \n \n  14See Actuary Report, “Family Care Capitated Rates, CY 2005” (November 22, 2004), \nposted  on  the    DHFS  website  at: \nhttp://dhfs.wisconsin.gov/LTCare/StateFedReqs/RateReport2005.pdf (Ex. 2008). \n \n- 7 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 7 of 46   Document 71 \n\nnecessary to cost-effectively meet the participant’s assessed needs, in exchange for the \nmonthly capitated payment for that individual.15 \n•  DHFS, as the state Medicaid agency, does not make direct payments to the providers who \nrender Family Care services.  Instead, DHFS pays the respective CMO the capitated rate \nbased on the total number of Family Care enrollees the CMO serves per month.  The \nFamily Care CMO pays its providers, and is responsible for setting payment rates at a \nlevel that will attract a sufficient number of qualified providers to provide services to all \nentitled persons who seek enrollment in the CMO.16 \nThe plaintiffs include six individual Milwaukee County Family Care recipients and their \nrespective guardians or authorized representatives.  All of the plaintiff recipients are aged 60 or \nover and each is disabled as a result of a developmental disability or because of disabilities \nassociated  with  aging.    Plaintiffs  Nelson,  Bzdawka,  Ehrlichman  and  Berdikoff  are  legally \nincompetent  (Am.  Comp.  ¶¶  5-10).    Plaintiffs  Czarnecki  and  Gorton  both  have significant \ndisabilities that affect their ability to make decisions (id.). \n  The Amended Complaint alleges that providers servicing MA recipients in conventional \nHCBS waiver programs (COP, CIP and BI waivers) have been given more favorable rates and \nhave been granted increases in their rates more readily than Milwaukee County Family Care \nproviders (Am. Comp. ¶¶ 56-57).  Plaintiffs also allege that the ability of Family Care recipients \nto  select  specific  day  programs  and  residential  placements  is  more  limited  than  that  of \nparticipants in the COP, CIP and BI waiver programs (Am. Comp. ¶ 52).   \n                                                 \n  15 See n.2, CMO contract at pp. 15 et seq.,  (Ex. 2002). \n \n  16See n.2, CMO contract at pp. 60-61, (Ex. 2002). \n \n- 8 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 8 of 46   Document 71 \n\n  In 2004, Dr. Kallas, an executive officer of Senior Residential Care of America, Inc., \nwhich  owns  the  facilities  where  plaintiffs  Czarnecki  and  Gorton  currently  reside,  allegedly \nconducted a mail survey of Wisconsin Family Care providers around the state (Am. Comp. ¶ 59). \nThe Amended Complaint alleges that 80% of the respondents stated they were being paid below \n“their cost of care as determined by an audit,” while 8.5% of the respondents indicated they were \nbeing paid the equivalent of their cost of care and 5.7% said they were being paid more than their \ncost of care (id.).   \n  Plaintiffs allege that the capitated rates for Family Care set by DHFS for the years 2000 \nthrough 2004 were “insufficient to provide appropriate services to persons with disabilities in \nMilwaukee County and were a substantial factor in causing the Milwaukee County Family Care \nprogram to operate at a deficit” during the same period (Am. Comp. ¶ 60).  Plaintiffs also allege \nthat  the  capitated  rates  were  a  substantial  factor  in  causing  numerous  adult  family  homes \n(“AFHs”), community-based residential facilities (“CBRFs”) and day programs for AFH and \nCBRS residents “to operate at a loss and either cease operation or be at a substantial risk of \nceasing operation” (id.).   \nAccording to plaintiffs, Milwaukee County’s residential rates for 2005 “will lead to \nsignificant numbers of residential providers either leaving the Family Care program or declaring \nbankruptcy” (Am. Comp. ¶ 61).  Plaintiffs further allege that the capitated rate set by DHFS for \nthe 2005 calendar year is insufficient to provide appropriate services to persons with disabilities \nin Milwaukee County and, at the same time, eliminate Milwaukee County’s Family Care deficit \nand  provide  reimbursement  to  AFHs,  CBRFs  and  day  programs  sufficient  to  support  their \ncontinued operation (Am. Comp. ¶ 63).  Plaintiffs predict that the failure to provide reasonable \nrates and cost of living increases will cause numerous providers either to cut the level of services \n- 9 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 9 of 46   Document 71 \n\nthey provide or refuse to serve disabled Milwaukee County residents, forcing them to move from \ntheir homes, lose their day services and cause substantial numbers to be admitted to institutions \nsuch as nursing homes (Am. Comp. ¶ 64). \n  Plaintiffs  Nelson,  Bzdawka,  Ehrlichman  and  Berdikoff  are  developmentally  disabled \npersons (Am Comp. ¶¶ 65, 80, 91, 101).  Each resides at either an adult family home or a CBRF \noperated by Homes for Independent Living (“HIL”) and all four attend a day program operated \nby HIL as well (Am. Comp. ¶¶ 67, 82, 93 and 102).  Plaintiffs Czarnecki and Gorton each reside \nin  CBRFs operated by a different provider, Senior Residential Care of America (Am. Comp. \n¶¶ 111, 121).  Plaintiffs Nelson and Bzdawka are both under the supervision of the Milwaukee \nCounty Probate Court and in each case, their placements have been determined to be appropriate \nto their needs (Am. Comp. ¶¶ 70, 84).  In the case of Berdikoff, Ehrlichman, Czarnecki and \nGorton, their agents or family members all approve of their placements and prefer that each \nindividual continue in his or her current placement (Am. Comp. ¶¶  94, 104, 113 and 123). \n  HIL,  the  residential  and  day  services  provider  for  Nelson,  Bzdawka,  Berdikoff  and \nEhrlichman, has been negotiating with the Milwaukee County CMO for several years in an \nunsuccessful attempt to obtain a higher contract rate for the provision of services to all four \nplaintiffs as well as other Family Care clients (Am. Comp. ¶¶ 73, 90, 97 and 106).  The rates that \nthe CMO has been willing to approve for HIL placements are lower than rates paid by the \nMilwaukee County Disability Services Division (“MCDSD”) for conventional HCBS waiver \nservices and by other counties for serving persons with similar needs, but the CMO has refused \nto approve a “cost of living increase” for Family Care services to the plaintiffs or for other clients \n(Am. Comp. ¶¶ 72-74, 86-87, 96-97 and 105-06).  HIL brought the situation to a head by \nnotifying the Milwaukee CMO that it would terminate its Family Care contract and that the \n- 10 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 10 of 46   Document 71 \n\nfunding  dispute  was  the  only  reason  for  the  contract  termination  (Am.  Comp.  ¶¶  75-76).  \nAlthough  the CMO reacted to the contract termination notice by seeking to move Nelson, \nBzdawka, Ehrlichman and Berdikoff to different group homes or CBRFs and different day \nprograms over their guardians’ objections, HIL and the CMO have agreed that all four will stay \nin their present placements pending resolution of this case or further order of the Court (id. ¶¶ 77, \n88, 98 and 107). \n  In the cases of plaintiffs Czarnecki and Gorton, their provider, Senior Residential Care, \nhas also attempted without success to obtain a rate increase from the Milwaukee CMO for the \nprovision of services to Family Care clients (id. ¶ 114).  The Family Care rate authorized for \nSenior Residential Care’s CBRF’s in Milwaukee County is substantially less than the COP \nwaiver  program  rate  authorized by Waukesha County for identical services at a Waukesha \nCounty Senior Residential Care facility (id. ¶ 115).  Senior Residential Care has issued public \nstatements  that  it  is  losing  money  under  its  current  Family  Care  rates  (id.  ¶¶  116,  124).  \nAccording to the Amended Complaint, it is probable that in the “foreseeable future” Senior \nResidential Care will refuse to accept Family Care clients or will be forced to close its residential \nfacities (id. ¶¶ 117, 125). \n  In the case of each of the plaintiffs, the complaint alleges, it would be “very traumatic and \nharmful” to each of them to be removed from their current placements (id. ¶¶ 81, 89, 99, 108, \n118  and  126).    In  each  case,  the complaint further alleges, because of the severity of the \ndisabilities of each one, it is likely that moving him or her “would worsen his [or her] condition \nand lead to placement in a nursing home or similar situation” (id. ¶¶ 82, 90, 100, 109, 119 \nand 127). \n- 11 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 11 of 46   Document 71 \n\nARGUMENT \nI.  ALL NINE COUNTS MUST BE DISMISSED BECAUSE PLAINTIFFS \nLACK  STANDING  OR  BECAUSE  THEY  ARE  NOT  RIPE  FOR \nADJUDICATION. \nA.  Standing and ripeness implicate the essential constitutional \nrequirement  that  a  “case  or  controversy”  must  exist \nbetween the parties. \n  Under article III of the United States Constitution, federal courts only have jurisdiction \nover “cases and controversies.”  Smith v. Wisconsin Dept. of Agriculture, 23 F.3d 1134, 1141 \n(7th  Cir.  1994).    “Standing  to  sue  or  defend  is  an  aspect  of  the  case-or-controversy \nrequirement.”  Arizonans  for  Official  English  v.  Arizona,  520  U.S.  43,  64  (1997)  (citations \nomitted).   In order to qualify as a person with standing to litigate, a person must show, first and \nforemost, “‘an invasion of a legally protected interest’ which is ‘concrete and particularized’ and \n‘“actual  or  imminent,  not  ‘conjectural’  or  ‘hypothetical.’”    Lujan  v.  Defenders  of  Wildlife, \n504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992) (internal citations omitted); see also Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811, 818, \n(1997).  Plaintiffs have the burden of proving the existence of standing.  Cf. Valley Forge, Etc. v. \nAmericans United, Etc., 454 U.S. 464, 473 (1982). \n  To have standing, a party must show:  (1) a direct and palpable injury; (2) that the injury \ncan be fairly traced to the challenged action of the defendant; and (3) that the injury is likely to be \nredressed if the relief sought is granted.  See Valley Forge, Etc., 454 U.S. at 472; Oak Ridge Care \nCenter v. Racine County, Wis., 896 F. Supp 867, 871 (E.D. Wis. 1995).   These three components \ncomprise “the core” of Article III’s case or controversy requirement.  See Steel Co. v. Citizens for \na Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 103-04 (1998).   \n  A plaintiff must have a personal stake in the outcome, which requires both a “distinct and \npalpable injury” to the plaintiff and a “fairly traceable” causal connection between the claimed \n- 12 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 12 of 46   Document 71 \n\ninjury and the challenged conduct.  See Banks v. Secretary of Indiana Family & Soc. Serv., \n790 F. Supp. 1427, 1434 (N.D. Ind. 1992); cf. U.S. ex rel. Hall v. Tribal Development Corp., \n49 F.3d 1208 (7th Cir. 1995). \nA plaintiff has standing to sue—that is, he can invoke the jurisdiction of the \ncourt—if he is tangibly, materially, injured by the conduct of the defendant that he \nclaims is unlawful and if the relief he seeks would redress the injury in whole or \nin part and thus confer a material benefit upon him. \n \nBruggeman v. Blagojevich, 324 F.3d 906, 909 (7th Cir. 2003).  In other words, each plaintiff \nmust demonstrate “an individuated harm impacting specifically upon him [or her] and of a \ntangible, concrete nature.”  L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law, § 3-16 at 114 (2d ed. 1988). \n  In order to establish standing for purposes of declaratory or injunctive relief, the injury \nneed not already have occurred.    A state agency that has “‘plainly indicated’ an intent to enforce \nan act that would affect the rights” presented a present and concrete controversy within the meaning \nboth of the Declaratory Judgment Act and Article III of the Constitution.  California v. LaRue, \n409 U.S. 109, 112 n.3 (1972) (quoting from Public Utilities Comm’n of California v. United States, \n355 U.S. 534, 539 (1958)).  Also see Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499 (1975) (a federal court’s \njurisdiction can be invoked only when the plaintiff himself has suffered “some threatened or actual \ninjury,” quoting from Linda R.S. v. Richard D., 410 U.S. 614, 617 (1973) (emphasis added).   \n  Where, as here, the challenged conduct is only threatened, “[t]he plaintiff must show \nthat ‘he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury’ \nas the result of the challenged official conduct and the injury or threat of injury must \nbe both ‘real and immediate,’ not ‘conjectural’ or hypothetical.’“ \n \nUnited States ex rel. LeBlanc v. Raytheon Co., 729 F. Supp. 170, 172 (D. Mass. 1990), aff’d, \n913 F.2d 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (quoting Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 101-02 (1983)). \n  In  Adarand  Constructors,  Inc.  v.  Pena,  515  U.S.  200  (1995),  the  Court  held  that \nconstruction contractors could sue to challenge affirmative action requirements on future jobs they \n- 13 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 13 of 46   Document 71 \n\nhad not yet bid upon.  The Court said the test is whether the injury is concrete and particularized \nand actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.  Id. at 211.  Adarand was not required to \ndemonstrate that it had been, or would be, the low bidder.  Id.  The injury to Adarand from a \ndiscriminatory classification lay in being prevented from competing on an equal footing.  The \nimminence test was met because the agency was likely to let contracts involving guardrail work \ncontaining the disqualifying clause at least once per year; the plaintiff was very likely to bid on each \nsuch contract; and the plaintiff often had to compete for such contracts against small disadvantaged \nbusinesses.  Id. at 212.    \n  For a declaratory judgment to issue, however, “there must be a dispute which ‘calls, not for \nan advisory opinion upon a hypothetical basis, but for an adjudication of present right upon \nestablished facts.’”  Ashcroft v. Mattis, 431 U.S. 171, 172 (1977), quoting Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. \nHaworth, 300 U.S. 227, 242 (1937).  Even when the jurisdictional prerequisites for standing are \nsatisfied, the district court has wide discretion in deciding whether declaratory relief is appropriate.  \nSee Nationwide Ins. v. Zavalis, 52 F.3d 689, 692 (7th Cir. 1995). \n  The doctrine of ripeness is based on both constitutional and prudential grounds.  Koehring \nCo. v. Adams, 605 F.2d 280, 282 (7th Cir. 1979).  Under Article III, federal courts may only \nadjudicate  “cases  or  controversies”  and  may  not  render  advisory  opinions.    Wisconsin’s \nEnvironmental Decade, Inc. v. State Bar of Wisconsin, 747 F.2d 407, 410 (7th Cir. 1984), cert. \ndenied, 471 U.S. 1100 (1985).  Ripeness is a jurisdictional prerequisite.  Smith, 23 F.3d at 1142.  \nCases are unripe when the parties point only to hypothetical, speculative, or illusory disputes as \nopposed to actual, concrete conflicts.  In this regard, ripeness is closely related to its justiciability \ncousins, the doctrines of finality and standing.   \n- 14 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 14 of 46   Document 71 \n\n  In Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136 (1967), the Court explained that the \nrationale of ripeness \n  is  to  prevent  the  courts,  through  avoidance  of  premature  adjudication,  from \nentangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies, and \nalso  to  protect  the  agencies  from  judicial  interference  until  an  administrative \ndecision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging \nparties. \nId. at 148.  The Court elaborated a two-part standard for evaluating the ripeness of claims.  A court \nmust first weigh the fitness of the issues for judicial decision.  It must then evaluate the hardship to \nthe parties of withholding court consideration.  Id. at 149.  As stated in United Public Workers of \nAmerica v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75, 89-90 (1947): \n  The power of courts, and ultimately of this Court to pass upon the constitutionality \nof acts of Congress arises only when the interests of litigants require the use of this \njudicial authority for their protection against actual interference. \n    For example, in the Smith v. Wisconsin Department of Agriculture case, the court held that a \nsuit by dairy farmers claiming that procedures for suspension of milk permits violated due process \nwas not ripe, and the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, where the farmer was under \nno present threat of suspension even though he would be subject to regulatory inspections.  Id., \n23 F.3d at 1142.   \nB.  Plaintiffs lack standing to seek retroactive declaratory or \nmonetary relief for actions of either the State defendants or \nMilwaukee County for the period prior to the filing of this \nlawsuit because they fail to allege any direct or tangible \ninjury  to  themselves  that  this  court  can redress for that \nperiod of time. \n  The Fourth Amended Complaint sets forth nine counts against both the State defendants \nand  Milwaukee  County.    The  first  eight  counts  are  paired  counts  under  the  ADA  and \nRehabilitation Act so that each ADA claim (Counts 1-4) is accompanied by a twin Rehabilitation \nAct claim (Counts 5-8) which are essentially identical to each other in substance, but are based \n- 15 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 15 of 46   Document 71 \n\non the respective statutes.  In general, these eight counts seek declaratory and injunctive relief \nbecause  “Family  Care  policies,  procedures  and  rates  related  to  funding”  for  Adult  Family \nHomes,  Community-Based  Residential  Facilities  and  day  programs  “have  in  the  past  and \ncontinue to” discriminate against the plaintiffs in various alleged ways based on their disabilities \n(cf. Am. Comp. ¶¶ 143, 148, 153, 156, 162, 166, 171, and 174) (emphasis supplied).   \n  Count 9 alleges a private right of action under the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, \nbased on what are often called the “quality of service” and “equal access provisions” of the \nMedicaid statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A), and is a direct challenge to the adequacy of the \ncapitated rates set by DHFS and paid to the Milwaukee County CMO for the years 2000 through \n2004 (Am. Comp. ¶ 183) and during year 2005 as well  (Am. Comp. ¶ 184).  The complaint \nseeks a declaratory judgment to the effect that the defendants have violated and continue to \nviolate the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act and (a)(30)(a), and prospective injunctive relief related \nto  the  funding  for  Family  Care  (Am.  Comp.  at  34).    In  addition,  the  complaint  demands \nretroactive monetary relief requiring that “future rates set by the State defendants include an \namount sufficient to alleviate the shortfall in Milwaukee County’s Family Care program caused \nby inadequate capitated rates from 2000 through the present” (id.,  ¶¶ (F) and (G)). \n  The problem with every one of these claims based on past actions of the State defendants \nand  Milwaukee  County  is  that  plaintiffs  fail  to  allege  any  “direct  and  palpable  injury”  to \nthemselves during the period from 2000 to the present that is “likely to be redressed by a \nfavorable decision.”  See Valley Forge, Etc., 454 U.S. at 472.   \n  The complaint contains no allegations that the plaintiffs have not been entirely satisfied \nwith the residential and day program placements each has had during the period each has been \nenrolled in the Family Care program from the time of their enrollment to the present time (see \n- 16 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 16 of 46   Document 71 \n\ngen. Am. Comp. ¶¶ 65-127).  Accordingly, none of the plaintiffs claims any past violation of the \nintegration, least restrictive setting and reasonable accommodation requirements of the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act, nor any violation of (a)(30)(a), with regard to themselves personally. \n  The complaint does allege that, when HIL, the residential and day services provider for \nplaintiffs Nelson, Bzdawka, Berdikoff and Ehrlichman served notice on the Milwaukee CMO \nthat HIL intended to terminate its contract, the CMO reacted by planning to move the plaintiffs to \ndifferent facilities (Am.Comp. ¶¶ 77, 88, 98 and 107).  But a simple “move,” a mere change in \nplacement alone, whether the change is threatened or actual, is not an injury that “is likely to be \nredressed by a favorable decision” under the statutes plaintiffs seek to invoke. See Valley Forge, \nEtc., 454 U.S. at 472.   \n  Under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, the court has jurisdiction to insure that plaintiffs \nare placed in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs and that they be reasonably \naccommodated.  See gen. Olmstead v. L.C. by Zimring, 527 U.S. 581, 590-02, 607 (1999).  \nUnder (a)(30(A), which plaintiffs also seek to invoke, the MA statute requires that the state MA \nplan provide methods and procedures “as may be necessary . . . to assure that payments are \nconsistent with efficiency, economy and quality of care and are sufficient to enlist enough \nproviders so that care and services are available under the plan at least to the extent such care and \nservices are available to the general population in the geographic area.”  Furthermore, the Court \nis empowered to remedy past violations of plaintiffs’ rights under these statutes. None of these \nstatutes,  however,  protects  plaintiffs  against  simply  being  moved  to  a  different  residential \nplacement,  nor  do  they  confer  on  this  court  the  authority  to  remedy  individual  placement \ndecisions absent a cognizable injury to plaintiffs.  See Valley Forge, Etc., 454 U.S. at 472.  \n- 17 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 17 of 46   Document 71 \n\n  In essence, applying the standing analysis set forth above, plaintiffs lack standing to \npursue claims for retroactive declaratory or monetary relief for the period from year 2000 to the \npresent  because  none  of  them  alleges  any  past  or  current  injury—neither  past  disability \ndiscrimination nor past deprivation of MA services—that this Court is empowered to remedy.  \nAccordingly, plaintiffs lack standing to litigate any of their claims to the extent they seek relief \nfor any period prior to the filing of this litigation.  Cf. Id.; Bruggeman, 324 F.3d at 909.  \nApplying Bruggeman, the plaintiffs cannot invoke the jurisdiction of the court because they have \nnot been “tangibly, materially, injured” by the past conduct of either set of defendants and \nbecause the relief they seek would not “redress the injury . . . and thus confer a material benefit” \nupon them.  Id. \nC.  Plaintiffs’  speculative  predictions  of  future  disastrous \nconsequences to providers and, in turn, to themselves are \ninsufficient to establish ripeness necessary to litigate either \ntheir ADA and Rehabilitation Act discrimination claims or \ntheir Medicaid claim. \n  While plaintiffs certainly attempt to assert claims of past injury to their rights under the \nADA, Rehabilitation Act and (a)(30)(A), the primary focus of their latest amended complaint \ncontinues to be allegations that the cumulative effect of the State defendants’ and Milwaukee \nCounty’s alleged violations of the statutes will result in future injuries to themselves that this \nCourt should remedy through injunctive or declaratory relief. \n  Plaintiffs allege that the capitated rates for Family Care paid by DHFS to Milwaukee \nCounty have caused the Milwaukee County CMO to operate at a deficit and that the capitated \nrates were a substantial factor in causing “numerous” AFHs, CBRFs and day programs to operate \nat a loss and either cease operation already or to be at a substantial risk of ceasing operation in \nthe future (Am. Comp. ¶ 60).  They further allege that the rates paid by the Milwaukee County \n- 18 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 18 of 46   Document 71 \n\nCMO to providers “will lead to significant numbers of residential providers either leaving the \nFamily Care program or declaring bankruptcy” (Am. Comp. ¶ 61).  They predict that the County \nCMO’s failure to provide reasonable rates and cost of living increases “will cause” numerous \nproviders of residential services either to cut services or refuse to serve disabled Milwaukee \nCounty residents, “forc[ing them] to move from their homes and to lose their day services” and, \nin turn, “cause substantial numbers of these residents to be admitted to institutions such as \nnursing homes” (Am. Comp. ¶ 64).   \n  As to the plaintiffs personally, HIL, the residential and day program provider for plaintiffs \nNelson, Bzdawka, Ehrlichman and Berdikoff, has sought to terminate its Family Care contract, \nthus forcing the Milwaukee County CMO to initiate the process of seeking different placements \nfor those plaintiffs (Am. Comp. ¶¶ 75-77, 88, 98 and 107).  As to plaintiffs Czarnecki and \nGorton, their residential service provider, Senior Residential Care, has issued public statements \nthat it is losing money because of its current Family Care contract rates and that it will not be \nable to sustain these losses much longer (Am. Comp. 116, 124).  As a result, plaintiffs allege that \nSenior Residential Care will refuse to accept Family Care clients or will be forced to close its \nresidential facilities “in the foreseeable future” (Am. Comp. ¶¶ 117, 125), presumably requiring \nplaintiffs Czarnecki and Gorton to move to a different facility if they wish to remain enrolled in \nFamily  Care.    Plaintiffs  allege  that  these  forced  future  moves,  if  they  occur,  will  be  very \ntraumatic and harmful to each and will, in turn, likely cause their individual disabilities to \nworsen, thus leading to their individual “placement in a nursing home or similar situation” (Am. \nComp. ¶¶ 82, 90, 100, 109, 119 and 127). \n  Clearly, although plaintiffs allege threatened harm, they do not claim to have sustained, \nnor are they “‘immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury.’” Cf. U.S. ex rel. LeBlanc, \n- 19 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 19 of 46   Document 71 \n\n729 F. Supp. at 172. Plaintiffs’ claims of threatened future injury are entirely “conjectural or \nhypothetical”; they are neither direct nor “real and immediate” id., rendering claims based on \nsuch injuries unripe for adjudication.  In one sense at least, “ripeness is about when [plaintiffs] \ncan sue”; a matter of whether they can sue “yet” rather than whether they can ever sue.  See \nSmith, 23 F.3d at 1141 (emphasis in original).   Regardless of whether plaintiffs can sue at all, the \nState defendants respectfully suggest that they clearly cannot sue “yet” to redress claims that they \nmay, some day, be forced to move and that, as a result of such a move, they will eventually end \nup in residential placements that violate rights protected by the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act or \n(a)(30)(A).  Id.  \n  The threatened future injuries, if they occur at all, are not direct violations of plaintiffs’ \nstatutory rights nor direct injuries to themselves.  The claimed threats of future injury are based \non allegations that the rates paid to residential providers in the future will result in sufficient \nnumbers of providers refusing to provide Family Care services so that, as a result, plaintiffs \nallege, they will be forced to relocate to different residential placements and, ultimately, to \nnursing homes.  Moreover, these threats of future indirect injury are significantly dependent on \nthe assumption that the Milwaukee County CMO will violate its obligations under both the CMO \ncontract and the statutes themselves to assure that plaintiffs are placed consistently with their \nneeds and protected rights.  Yet plaintiffs have not alleged any facts to support a claim that the \nMilwaukee County CMO is currently placing Family Care enrollees without due regard for their \nneeds and protected rights and there is no basis whatever for a presumption that it will do so in \nthe future.  Furthermore, each has available an immediate administrative remedy in the form of a \ngrievance and fair hearing process, should they be dissatisfied with any potential future change of \nplacement.  See n.2, CMO Contract at 54-55 (Ex. 2002).   \n- 20 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 20 of 46   Document 71 \n\n  The danger of any potential future injury to plaintiffs is remote indeed.  In short, because \nplaintiffs’ claims of threatened future injury are entirely hypothetical and speculative, they are \nnot ripe for adjudication and must be dismissed as a result.  See Smith, 23 F.3d at 1141-1142. \nD.  Plaintiffs  lack  standing  to  challenge  the  capitated  rates \nDHFS pays to the Milwaukee County CMO under the terms \nof the Family Care contract. \n  As  indicated  above  at  4,  Family  Care  is  authorized  by federal Medicaid authorities \npursuant to two types of waivers and an approved prepaid health plan authorizing DHFS to \ncontract for State Plan long-term care services on a prepaid basis.  See nn. 3 and 4 (Exhibits 2003 \nand 2004).  The managed care aspect of Family Care permits DHFS to limit services in the \nFamily Care benefit to those persons who enroll in a CMO.  See gen. 42 U.S.C. § 1296n(b) and \nWis. Stat. §§ 46.281, 46.284 and 46.286.  The CMO manages and delivers the Family Care \nbenefit.  Wis. Stat. § 46.284.  DHFS provides funding on a capitated basis for the provision of \nservices under Family Care.  Wis. Stat. § 46.284(5).  In exchange for the capitated payments, the \nCMO is required by the terms of the CMO contract to manage and provide all services necessary \nto meet a participant’s assessed needs in a cost-effective manner.  See n.2, above, CMO contract \nat 1, 15 (Exhibit 2002). \n  Although all nine of plaintiffs’ current counts focus on funding for AFHs, CBRFs and \nday programs, Counts 4, 8 and 9 focus directly and exclusively on the adequacy of “the fixed \ncapitation rate” paid by DHFS to the Milwaukee County CMO and on the “methods used to \ndetermine  provider  rates”  employed  by  Milwaukee  County  (Am.  Comp.  ¶¶  156,  174,  183 \nand 184).    Indeed,  via  their  Amended  Response  to  State  Defendants’  First  Interrogatories, \nplaintiffs have recently confirmed their claim that “deficiencies in any services provided to \nMilwaukee Family Care recipients, including assessment and evaluation methods, are the result \n- 21 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 21 of 46   Document 71 \n\nof the state defendants’ failure to set an adequate capitated rate for calendar years 2000 through \n2005.”  See Exhibit 2009 at 2, attached to State Defendants’ Motions to Dismiss.  It appears, \ntherefore, that should the court reject the standing and ripeness arguments set forth in Secs. I.B \nand I.C, above, the justiciability of this entire case turns on whether plaintiffs’ have standing to \nattack the capitated rates DHFS pays the Milwaukee County CMO, as they plainly seek to do.  \n  In  addition  to  the  general  objections  to  plaintiffs’  standing  argued  above,  the  State \ndefendants specifically submit that plaintiffs lack standing to attack the capitated rates paid by \nDHFS to the Milwaukee County CMO under the CMO contract.  In return for accepting the \ncapitated rates—and regardless of their claimed adequacy or inadequacy in plaintiffs’ eyes—the \nCMO has obligated itself under the contract to provide Family Care enrollees, including the \nplaintiffs, with the full range of Family Care services the individual enrollee needs under his or \nher plan of care.  See n.2, CMO Contract at pp. 15 et seq. (Ex. 2002).  The CMO contracts with \nservice providers who, in turn, provide the Family Care services needed by individual enrollees.   \n  The  State  defendants  neither  negotiate  nor  contract  with  the  providers,  nor  do  they \nprovide the services to which plaintiffs are entitled under Family Care.  Although plaintiffs \ncomplain that the capitated rates are inadequate, they are not parties to the CMO contracts.  The \nMilwaukee County CMO, which is a party to the CMO contract, is obligated to manage and \nprovide for the Family Care services plaintiffs need in return for the capitated rates set by the \nState defendants.   \n  The Fourth Amended Complaint simply fails to allege facts showing how the capitated \nrates directly injure the plaintiffs, since Family Care recipients or beneficiaries are entitled to \nFamily Care services regardless of the level or adequacy of the capitated rates.  See Wis. Stat. \n§§ 46.284(4)(d) and (5).   With regard to the capitated rates, therefore, plaintiffs have failed to \n- 22 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 22 of 46   Document 71 \n\ndemonstrate the second essential component of standing or justiciability:  they have failed to \nallege how any injury to themselves “can be fairly traced to” the capitated rates set by DHFS.  \nSee Valley Forge, Etc., 454 U.S. at 472. \nII.  PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS FOR RETROACTIVE DECLARATORY AND \nMONETARY  RELIEF  BASED  ON  §  1983  AND  THE  MEDICAID \nSTATUTE,  AND  TITLE  II  OF  THE  ADA  MUST  BE  DISMISSED \nBECAUSE SUCH RELIEF AGAINST THE STATE DEFENDANTS IS \nBARRED  BY  SOVEREIGN  IMMUNITY  AND  THE  ELEVENTH \nAMENDMENT. \n  The Complaint includes a demand for retroactive monetary relief of a decidedly unusual \nsort, requesting that the State defendants reimburse Milwaukee County for allegedly inadequate \ncapitated payments sufficient to “alleviate the shortfall” allegedly caused by the State defendants’ \n“inadequate capitated rates from the year 2000 to the present” (Am. Comp. at 34, Conclusion F). \nApart from the obvious question of plaintiff Family Care recipients’ standing to advance such a \nclaim,17  addressed  above,  the  State  defendants  contend  that  the  Court  lacks  jurisdiction  to \nentertain such a claim because, except for counts based on § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, \nsovereign immunity and the Eleventh Amendment bar such retroactive monetary relief against \nthem. \n  The Constitution recognizes a state’s sovereign immunity from suit.  See College Savings \nBank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary, 527 U.S. 666, 684 (1999).  The Eleventh Amendment to \nthe Constitution provides, “The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to \nextend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by \n                                                 \n  17On its face, at least, the demand for relief is framed simply as an attempt to recoup from \nthe State defendants money for the county treasury. \n- 23 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 23 of 46   Document 71 \n\nCitizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.”  This Amendment  \nis convenient shorthand but something of a misnomer, for the sovereign immunity \nof the States neither derives from, nor is limited by, the terms of the Eleventh \nAmendment. . . . [T]he States’ immunity from suit is a fundamental aspect of the \nsovereignty which the States enjoyed before the ratification of the Constitution, \nand which they retain today (either literally or by virtue of the admission into the \nUnion upon an equal footing with the other States) except as altered by the plan of \nthe Convention or certain constitutional Amendments. \n \nAlden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 713 (1999).  The Eleventh Amendment “does not define the scope \nof the States’ sovereign immunity; it is but one particular exemplification of that immunity.” \nFederal Maritime Commission v. S.C. State Ports Authority, 535 U.S. 743, 753 (2002). \n  It is jurisdictional “in the sense that it is a limitation on the federal court’s judicial power, \nand therefore can be raised at any stage of the proceedings.”  Calderon v. Ashmus, 523 U.S. 740, \n745 n.2 (1998).  See Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents, 528 U.S. 62, 73 (2000) (it “does not \nprovide for federal jurisdiction over suits against non-consenting States”).  “This withdrawal of \njurisdiction effectively confers an immunity from suit.” Puerto Rico Aqueduct & Sewer Auth. v. \nMetcalf & Eddy, 506 U.S. 139, 144 (1993).   \nThere  are  “only  two  circumstances  in  which  an  individual  may  sue  a  State.    First, \nCongress may authorize such a suit in the exercise of its power to enforce the Fourteenth \nAmendment. . . . Second, a State may waive its sovereign immunity by consenting to suit.” \nCollege Savings Bank, 527 U.S. at 670.   \n  Sovereign immunity bars federal court “suits against the States and their agencies . . . \nregardless of the relief sought.”  Puerto Rico Aqueduct & Sewer Auth., 506 U.S. at 146.  See \nSeminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 72 (1996) (the relief sought “is irrelevant to the \nquestion  whether  the  suit  is  barred”);  Pennhurst  State  School  &  Hospital  v.  Halderman, \n465 U.S. 89, 100-01 (1984) (this jurisdictional bar applies “regardless of the nature of the relief \n- 24 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 24 of 46   Document 71 \n\nsought”).  Accordingly, sovereign immunity bars an action for money damages against a state \nagency, Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 666-67 (1974); injunctive relief, Seminole Tribe of \nFlorida, 517 U.S. at 58, and Alabama v. Pugh, 438 U.S. 781 (1978); and declaratory relief.  \nBenning v. Board of Regents of Regency Universities, 928 F.2d 775, 778 (7th Cir. 1991). \nThe  rule  against  retrospective  monetary  relief  cannot  be  circumvented  by  labeling  it \nequitable restitution: it is a retrospective claim against the treasury.  Edelma, 415 U.S. at 663, \n665-68.  The bar applies “if the relief is tantamount to an award of damages for a past violation of \nfederal law, even though styled as something else.” Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 278 (1986). \n“Relief that in essence serves to compensate a party injured in the past by an action of a state \nofficial in his official capacity that was illegal under federal law is barred when the state official \nis the named defendant.”  Papasan, 478 U.S. at 278 (footnote omitted).  \n  To be distinguished are actions for prospective declaratory and injunctive relief against state \nofficials.  Sovereign immunity does not “preclude actions against state officials sued in their official \ncapacity for prospective injunctive or declaratory relief.”  Thiokol Corp. v. Department of Treasury, \n987 F.2d 376, 381 (6th Cir. 1993) (citing Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908).  Also see Benning, \n928 F.2d at 778 (sovereign immunity precludes declaratory relief against the state because Ex Parte \nYoung’s “authority-stripping fiction” is limited to actions against public officials).  \n  “Congress can abrogate state sovereign immunity only when it legislates to enforce the \nFourteenth Amendment.”  College Savings Bank, 527 U.S. at 671 (emphasis added).  “Seminole \nTribe makes clear that Congress may not abrogate state sovereign immunity pursuant to its \nArticle I powers.”  Florida Prepaid Postsecondary v. College Savings, 527 U.S. 627, 636 (1999). \n See Seminole Tribe of Florida, 517 U.S. at 72 (“Even when the Constitution vests in Congress \n- 25 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 25 of 46   Document 71 \n\ncomplete  lawmaking  authority  over  a  particular  area,  the  Eleventh  Amendment  prevents \ncongressional authorization of suits by private parties against unconsenting States”).  \n  Whether the abrogation arises from an act of Congress or a state waiver, the language \npurporting to do so must be expressed with unmistakable clarity.  Welch v. State Dept. of Highways \nand Public Transp., 483 U.S. 468, 474 (1987); Atascadero State Hosp. v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, \n239-40 (1985).  42 U.S.C. § 1983 is not such a waiver.  See Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, \n491 U.S. 58 (1989).  In this case, based on Edelman, Will  and many other cases, it is clear that \nplaintiffs cannot seek retroactive monetary relief against the State defendants based on their § 1983-\nMedicaid claim.  Id.18 \n  The Supreme Court recently held that Title II of the ADA, under which plaintiffs sue the \ndefendants here, constitutes a valid exercise of Congress’ enforcement power under the Fourteenth \nAmendment.  Tennessee v. Lane, 124 S. Ct. 1978, 1993 (2004).  However, Lane expressly refrained \nfrom addressing Eleventh Amendment immunity as a defense to Title II ADA claims outside “the \nclass of cases implicating the fundamental right of access to the courts.”  Id.   \n  Following Lane, therefore, whether retroactive monetary relief is available in suits against \nstates under Title II of the ADA outside the context of access to the courts remains an open question \nwhich the Court pointedly did not address, even though the plaintiff had asked for damages as well \nas equitable relief.  Id., at 1983.  Furthermore, the majority opinion emphasized that the primary \nADA  remedy  of  “reasonable  modifications”—a  form  of  prospective  injunctive  relief—is  “a \n                                                 \n  18In  Atascadero,  the  court  held  that  Congress  did  not  abrogate  the  State’s  Eleventh \nAmendment immunity in adopting the Rehabilitation Act.  See id., 473 at 247.  However, Congress \nsubsequently enacted 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-7 in response to Atascadero and the Supreme Court \nsubsequently  recognized  §  2000d-7  as  a  valid  and  unambiguous  waiver  of  states’  Eleventh \nAmendment immunity.  See Lane v. Pena, 518 U.S. 187, 200 (1996). \n- 26 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 26 of 46   Document 71 \n\nreasonable prophylactic measure, reasonably targeted to a legitimate end.”  Id., at 1994.  The State \ndefendants respectfully submit that, given the Court’s rationale and limited holding in Lane, that \nretroactive monetary relief is not available as a remedy in a suit against the State based on Title II of \nthe ADA.  See also Walker v. Snyder, 213 F.3d 344, 346-47 (7th Cir. 2000). \nIII.  THE  COMPLAINT  MUST  BE  DISMISSED  BECAUSE  THE  NINE \nASSORTED COUNTS FAIL TO STATE CLAIMS ON WHICH RELIEF \nCAN BE GRANTED. \nA.  A  complaint  must  allege  facts  sufficient  to  support  the \nelements of the claim:  factual and legal conclusions are not \nsufficient. \n  In considering a motion to dismiss under F.R.C.P. 12(b)(6), the court must accept as true all \nwell-pleaded factual allegations in the complaint, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the \nplaintiff.  Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 72 (1984); Yeksigian v. Nappi, 900 F.2d 101, \n102  (7th  Cir.  1990).    Cf.  F.R.C.P.  12(c);  City  of  Waukesha  v.  Viacom  International,  Inc., \n362 F. Supp.2d 1025, 1028 (E.D.Wis. 2005) (same standard applies under Rule 12(c)).  The court \nmay dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) only if “‘it \nappears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which \nwould entitled him to relief.’“  Strauss v. City of Chicago, 760 F.2d 765, 767 (7th Cir. 1985) \n(quoting Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1957)).  Although all reasonable inferences are to \nbe drawn in favor of the plaintiff, the complaint must set forth factual allegations sufficient to \nestablish the elements that are crucial to recovery under plaintiff’s claim.  Sutliff, Inc. v. Donovan \nCos., 727 F.2d 648, 654 (7th Cir. 1984).  Legal conclusions without factual support are not \nsufficient.  Benson v. Cady, 761 F.2d 335, 338 (7th Cir. 1985).  \n  Moreover, even the liberal notice pleading standards have their limits.  If there is no \n“reasonable prospect” that the plaintiff can make out a valid claim from the facts narrated in the \n- 27 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 27 of 46   Document 71 \n\ncomplaint, the court should grant the motion to dismiss.  Sutliff, Inc., 727 F.2d at 654; see also \nChaveriat v. Williams Pipe Line Co., 11 F.3d 1420, 1430 (7th Cir. 1993) (plaintiff may not \n“fumble around searching for a meritorious claim within the elastic boundaries of a barebones \ncomplaint”); Matter of Wade, 969 F.2d 241, 249 (7th Cir. 1992) (inferences plaintiffs asked court \nto  draw  from  alleged  facts  were  not  reasonable),  cert.  denied,  510  U.S.  870  (1993); \n5C Charles A. Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure, § 1368 at 248 (2004) \n(inferences drawn in favor of non-moving party must be reasonable and “cannot be indulged in \nwhen they are . . . inconsistent with matters that fall within the judicial notice doctrine”).  The \ncourt “need not accept as true allegations that contradict facts which may be judicially noticed.”  \nWestlands  Water  District  v.  U.S.  Department  of  the  Interior,  850  F.  Supp.  1388,  1399 \n(E.D. Cal. 1994).   \n  Plaintiffs have a responsibility to include allegations of fact sufficient to establish the \ncrucial  elements  of  their  claims.    Forest  County  Potawatomi  Community  v.  Doyle, \n828 F. Supp. 1401, 1405 (W.D.Wis. 1993), aff’d, 45 F.3d 1079 (7th Cir. 1995).  If they file \ncomplaints that assert legal conclusions without making adequate factual allegations to support \nthose conclusions, their complaints may be dismissed on Rule12 grounds.  Panaras v. Liquid \nCarbonic Industries Corp., 74 F.3d 786, 792 (7th Cir. 1996); Strauss, 760 F.2d at 767-68.  A \ncomplaint must contain either direct or inferential allegations respecting all the material elements \nnecessary to sustain a recovery under some viable theory.  Car Carriers, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., \n745 F.2d 1101, 1106 (7th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1054 (1985). \n  Since a court can take judicial notice of a document at any stage of the proceedings under \nFed. R. Evid. Rule 201(f), it can do so on a motion to dismiss without converting it to a motion for \nsummary judgment.  See Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin v. Thompson, 161 F.3d 449, 455-56 \n- 28 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 28 of 46   Document 71 \n\n(7th Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1066 (1999); MGIC Indem. Corp. v. Weisman, 803 F.2d 500, \n504 (9th Cir. 1986).  Under Fed. R. Evid. Rule 201(b), documents judicially noticed must be \n“capable  of  accurate  and  ready  determination  by  resort  to  sources  whose  accuracy  cannot \nreasonably be questioned.”  Public records and other documents filed in public offices are judicially \nnoticeable.  Mass. v. Westcott, 431 U.S. 322, 323 n. 2 (1977); Green v. Warden, U.S. Penitentiary, \n699 F.2d 364, 369 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 960 (1983); Reiner v. Washington Plate Glass \nCo., Inc., 711 F.2d 414, 416 (D.C. Cir. 1983).  A court may also refer to contention interrogatories \nin deciding a motion to dismiss.  See Sperling v. Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc., 924 F. Supp. 1396, \n1401-2 (D.N.J. 1996) (treating contention interrogatories as though included within the complaint \nitself).19 \nB.  Counts 1-8 must be dismissed because the complaint fails \nto state claims based on the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act. \n1.  Summary of the showings necessary to state claims \nfor which relief may be granted under Title II of the \nADA and § 504 of the Rehab Act. \n  The ADA provides that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such \ndisability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, \nor activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.  42 U.S.C. \n§ 12132.  Under Title II of the ADA, a “qualified individual with a disability” is someone who, \nwith or without reasonable modifications, meets the essential eligibility requirements to receive \npublic services or participate in a public program.  42 U.S.C. § 12131(2).  The ADA defines \n                                                 \n  19Based on the Fed. R. Evid. Rule 201(b) and (d) and the precedent cited in the text, the \nState defendants request that the court take judicial notice of the Family Care waiver documents \nposted on the DHFS website and cited, with electronic links, at nn 1-16 above.  A listing of the \ndocuments to which this request for judicial notice is directed, with exhibit numbers, is attached \nto this brief.  See n.1, above.  A copy of Plaintiff’s Amended Response to State Defendants’ First \nSet of Interrogatories is attached to the State defendants Motions to Dismiss as Exhibit 2009. \n- 29 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 29 of 46   Document 71 \n\n“disability” as a “physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the \nmajor life activities of the individual.”  42 U.S.C. § 12012(2)(A).  A “public entity” includes any \nspecial purpose district or other instrumentality of the state or local government.  42 U.S.C. \n§ 12131(1). \n  To establish a violation of Title II of the ADA, a plaintiff must show that (1) he or she is a \nqualified individual with a disability; (2) he or she is being excluded from participation in or \ndenied the benefits of some service, program or activity by reason of his or her disability, or \nsubjected to discrimination by reason of his or her disability; and (3) that the entity providing the \nservice, program or activity is a public entity.  Wisconsin Cmty Serv. v. City of Milwaukee, \n309 F. Supp. 2d 1096, 1103 (E.D. Wis. 2004). \n  The Rehab Act provides that “[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the \nUnited States, as defined in [29 U.S.C. § 706(8)], shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, \nbe excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination \nunder any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance[.]”  29 U.S.C. § 794(a).  See \nalso Branham v. Snow, 392 F.3d 896, 904 (7th Cir. 2004), reh’g denied (2005) (Rehab Act \nprohibits  discrimination  based  solely  on  a  person’s  disability).    The  Rehab  Act  defines \n“disability” similarly to definition of the same term in the ADA.  29 U.S.C. § 794(a).  “Otherwise \nqualified” means, for purposes of the Rehab Act, that if an individual were not disabled, he or \nshe  would  have  qualified  for  the  program  or  treatment  allegedly  denied  because  of  the \nindividual’s disability.  Grzan v. Charter Hosp. of Northwest Indiana, 104 F.3d 116, 120 & n.4 \n(7th Cir. 1997). \n  To survive a motion to dismiss a Rehab Act claim, the plaintiff’s prima facie case must \nshow that (1) he or she is an “individual with a disability” under the Act, (2) he or she is \n- 30 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 30 of 46   Document 71 \n\n“otherwise qualified” for the benefit sought, (3) he or she was excluded from participation, \ndenied benefits, or discriminated against solely by reason of his or her disability, and (4) the \nprogram or activity in question receives federal financial assistance. Grzan, 104 F.3d at 119 & \nn.4; Wisconsin Cmty Serv., 309 F. Supp. 2d at 1103; Branham, 392 F.3d at 902. \n  Relevant provisions of the ADA and the Rehab Act are similar.  Wisconsin Cmty. Serv., \n309 F. Supp. 2d at 1103.  Title II of the ADA was modeled on § 504 of the Rehab Act, and \nelements of claims under the two provisions are nearly identical.  Washington v. Indiana High \nSch. Athletic Assoc., 181 F.3d 840, 845 n.6 (7th Cir. 1999).  Standards and precedent applicable \nto one act also are applicable to the other.  Washington, 181 F.3d at 845 n.6; Wisconsin Cmty. \nServ., 309 F. Supp. 2d at 1103. \n  One key difference is that while the Rehab Act requires exclusion solely by reason of \ndisability, the ADA requires only that exclusion be by reason of the disability.  Washington, \n181 F.3d at 845 n.6.  Section 504 of the Rehab Act therefore prohibits discrimination against a \nperson  with  a  disability  only  if  the  individual’s  disability  is  unrelated  to  and  improper  to \nconsideration of the services in question. When medical treatment is the issue, typically the \ndisability itself creates or contributes to the need for services.  The term “otherwise qualified” \nconsequently cannot be applied in the context of medical treatment decisions without distorting \nits plain meaning.  Similarly, denial of treatment “solely by reason of disability” also does not fit \nallegations of discriminatory medical treatment.  Section 504 prohibits discrimination between \npersons with disabilities and persons without disabilities; it does not create absolute substantive \nrights to treatment, and is ill suited for bringing claims of discriminatory medical treatment in \nwhich the plaintiff compares his or her treatment (medical or non-medical) to the treatment \nafforded other persons with disabilities.  Grzan, 104 F.3d at 120-22. \n- 31 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 31 of 46   Document 71 \n\n2.  Failures  to  state  claims  for  which  relief  may  be \ngranted  common  to  Counts  One-Eight  of  the \nAmended Complaint. \n  Counts One through Eight against Secretary Nelson must be dismissed outright.  The \nAmended Complaint fails to allege any involvement or conduct whatsoever by Secretary Nelson \nin developing and implementing policies, procedures and rates relating to funding for AFHs, \nCBRFs and day programs for persons in AFHs and CBRFs (collectively, “services”).  The \nAmended Complaint further fails to allege any involvement or conduct whatsoever amounting to \nintentional discrimination by Secretary Nelson in the manners alleged in the Amended Complaint \nor in any other manner.  Instead, the Amended Complaint alleges only that Secretary Nelson is \nresponsible for the overall operation of DHFS and has the powers and duties of the head of a \nstate agency specified in Wis. Stat. § 15.04(1) (Am. Comp. ¶ 13).  That single conclusory \nallegation amounts to neither a direct factual allegation nor an inferential factual allegation \nlinking Secretary Nelson to development and implementation of policies, procedures and rates \nrelating to funding for the services.  Cf. Car Carriers, 745 F.2d at 1106.  Furthermore, as to \nCounts One, Three, Five and Seven alleging ADA violations, Secretary Nelson is an individual \nand not a “public entity” for purposes of the ADA.  Cf. 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1).  For all these \nreasons, Counts One-Eight fail to state claims against Secretary Nelson for which relief can be \ngranted and must be dismissed.    \n  Similarly,  Counts  One  through  Eight  all  allege  that  reasonable  modifications  or \nreasonable accommodations can be made to the Family Care program to serve plaintiffs in the \nmanner they advocate (Am. Comp.¶¶ 142, 147, 151, 155, 161, 165, 170, 173).  Counts One \nthrough  Eight  all  fail  to  state  claims  under either the ADA or the Rehab Act in which a \nreasonable accommodation or modification is possible, however. \n- 32 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 32 of 46   Document 71 \n\n  Regulations  implementing  the  ADA  require  a  public  entity  to  make  reasonable \nmodifications in policies, practices or procedures, “‘when the modifications are necessary to \navoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that \nmaking  the  modifications  would  fundamentally  alter  the  nature  of  the  service,  program  or \nactivity.’”   28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7), quoted in Wisconsin Cmty. Serv., 309 F. Supp. 2d at 1104.  \nThe  Rehab  Act  requires  reasonable  accommodation  unless  it  creates  undue  financial  or \nadministrative  burdens,  or  requires  a  fundamental  alteration  in  the  nature  of  the  program.  \nWisconsin  Cmty.  Serv.,  309  F.  Supp.  2d  at  1104.    The  Seventh  Circuit  has  framed  the \nfundamental alteration inquiry as “to ask whether waiver of the rule in the particular case at hand \nwould be so at odds with the purposes behind the rule that it would be a fundamental and \nunreasonable change.”  Washington, 181 F.3d at 850. \n  Plaintiffs already are participating in the Family Care program.  Plaintiffs’ proposed \nreasonable  accommodation  or  modification  consists  of  essentially  requiring  fee-for-service \npayments  to  providers  serving  Family  Care  members  in  the  same  way  that  fee-for-service \npayments are made to providers serving participants in the other waiver programs.  To require \nalteration of Family Care from a capitated rate to a fee-for-service system would eviscerate the \nentire purpose for the program and change it so fundamentally that it would no longer exist as a \nmanaged  care  capitated  rate  system.    Because  that  change  so  clearly  would  constitute  a \nfundamental alteration of the entire Family Care program, no reasonable accommodation or \nmodification is possible.  Counts One-Eight therefore fail to state claims for which relief can be \ngranted. \n  Finally, Counts Five-Eight fail to state claims for which relief may be granted because the \nAmended Complaint fails to allege that the plaintiffs were discriminated against solely on the \n- 33 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 33 of 46   Document 71 \n\nbasis of their disabilities as required by the Rehab Act.  The specific variations of discrimination \nalleged in Count Five distinguish between classes of persons with disabilities on the basis of (1) \nage, (2) county of residence, and (3) degree of disability (Am. Comp. ¶ 143).  The specific \nvariations of discrimination alleged in Counts Seven and Eight distinguish among classes of \npersons with disabilities on the basis of age—whether they are sixty years of age or older.    None \nof  these  are  distinctions  between  persons  with  disabilities  and  persons  without  disabilities.  \nRather than alleging that the plaintiffs were discriminated against solely on the basis of their \ndisability,  Count  Six  instead attacks the treatment decisions made by and for Family Care \nenrollees.  The Rehab Act does not create substantive rights to treatment, however, and cannot be \napplied in the context of comparative treatment decisions. The plaintiffs therefore fail to allege \nthat they are persons with disabilities otherwise qualified for the benefits allegedly denied them.  \nGrzan, 104 F.3d at 120-22.  Counts Five-Eight consequently all fail to state claims for which \nrelief can be granted under the Rehab Act. \n3.  Counts One and Five fail to state claims for which \nrelief can be granted. \n  Counts One (ADA) and Five (Rehab Act) allege that Milwaukee County residents with \ndisabilities aged 60 and older whose services are funded by Family Care receive substantially \ninferior treatment regarding payment for services compared to (1) Milwaukee County residents \nunder age 60 whose services are funded by the COP, CIP and BI programs; (2) residents of non-\nFamily Care counties with disabilities of any age whose services are funded by the COP, CIP and \nBI programs; and (3) Milwaukee County residents with less significant disabilities served by \nFamily Care (Am. Comp. ¶ 138-43, 157-62.) \n- 34 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 34 of 46   Document 71 \n\n  Neither the ADA nor the Rehab Act establish any obligation to meet a disabled persons’ \nparticular needs vis-à-vis the needs of other disabled persons.  Doe v. Pfrommer, 148 F.3d 73, 83 \n(2nd Cir. 1998).  Plaintiffs’ alleged distinction from the other groups alleged in Counts One and \nFive therefore affords no cognizable grounds for relief under the ADA or the Rehab Act.   \n  There is no allegation anywhere in the Amended Complaint of any facts demonstrating or \nimplying intentional discrimination by the State defendants against the plaintiffs on grounds of \nthe plaintiffs’ disabilities or any other grounds.  Counts consequently fail to state any intentional \ndiscrimination claim for which relief can be granted.  \n    Also, as to both Counts One and Five, none of the plaintiffs are being excluded from or \ndenied the benefits of some service, program or activity by reason of their disabilities.  It is \nparticipation in services, programs and activities that the ADA and Rehab Act protect—not \naccess to any specific funding stream to pay for those services, programs and activities, and not \nany universal, objective funding level for those services, programs and activities.  All of the \nplaintiffs are receiving residential and other services through the Family Care program in which \nthey are enrolled, by reason of their disabilities (Am. Comp. ¶¶ 71, 85, 95, 103, 112, 122). \n  Certain providers of services to the plaintiffs might want to be paid more money for \nproviding those services, but that does not amount to any kind of discrimination against the \nplaintiffs who indisputably have been and continue to receive services through their participation \nin the Family Care program. Family Care is not about writing blank checks to service providers; \nit is about providing effective, coordinated, appropriate services to Family Care members in an \nefficient and cost-effective manner.  Appropriate coordination and delivery of services to Family \nCare enrollees is guaranteed and protected by the state’s contract with the CMO, as explained in \nsections I.C. and I.D. above, not by the level of the capitated rate paid to the CMO.  Because the \n- 35 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 35 of 46   Document 71 \n\nproviders’ complaints about the rates they are paid by the CMO do not amount to discrimination \nagainst the plaintiffs who have been and continue to receive services and other benefits of \nparticipating in the Family Care program, Counts One and Five fail to state claims for which \nrelief can be granted under the ADA or the Rehab Act. \n4.  Counts Two and Six fail to state claims for which \nrelief may be granted. \n  Count Two (ADA) and Count Six (Rehab Act) allege that the State defendants Family \nCare policies, procedures and rates prevent persons with disabilities from obtaining the same \nresult, gaining the same benefit, or reaching the same level of achievement in the most integrated \nsetting appropriate to their needs.  Count Two further alleges that those polices, procedures and \nrates have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the \nobjectives of the Family Care and Medicaid programs (Am. Comp. ¶¶ 144-48, 163-66). \n  Counts Two and Six fail to state claims for which relief can be granted because they \nmake no sense.  They allege that Family Care policies, procedures and rates relating to funding \nfor services prevent persons with disabilities from obtaining the same result, gaining the same \nbenefit or reaching the same level of achievement in the most integrated setting appropriate to \ntheir needs—without identifying any comparison group against which to gauge attainment of the \nsame result, the same benefit and the same level of achievement.  There can be no discrimination \nagainst persons with disabilities absent another group of persons without disabilities treated \ndifferently.    \n  Nor are plaintiffs’ conclusory allegations about deprivation of the same results, benefits \nand achievements in the most integrated setting supported by evidentiary facts in the Amended \nComplaint.  None of the plaintiffs has claimed that he or she is not placed in the most integrated \n- 36 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 36 of 46   Document 71 \n\nsetting, and any possibility that a plaintiff’s residential placement might change in the future is \nnot equivalent to alleging deprivation of most integrated setting—all as explained above in \nSections I.C. and I.D.  And, even if the plaintiffs had alleged sufficient supporting facts, neither \nthe ADA nor the Rehab Act establish any obligation to meet a disabled persons’ particular needs \nvis-à-vis the needs of other disabled persons.  Doe, 148 F.3d at 83. \n  Relatedly, the State defendants’ role concerning direct care and decisions regarding the \nmost integrated settings for individual Family Care enrollees is non-existent as a matter of law.  \nUnder the Family Care contract, it is the county CMO—not the State defendants—that is legally \nresponsible for direct care service provision and decisions regarding the most integrated settings \nfor individual Family Care enrollees (see n.2 above, Exhibit 2002, pages 15-20, 26-42). \n  For these reasons, Counts Two and Six fail to state claims for which relief can be granted \nunder Title II of the ADA and § 504 of the Rehab Act. \n5.  Counts  Three  and  Seven  fail  to  state  claims  for \nwhich relief can be granted. \n  Counts Three (ADA) and Seven (Rehab Act) allege that Family Care policies, procedures \nand rates relating to funding for services as developed and implemented by DHFS and Secretary \nNelson  violate  integration  requirements  of  the  ADA  and  the  Rehab  Act  because  they \nsubstantially increase the probability that Milwaukee County residents with disabilities aged \n60 or older will be placed in more restrictive, less integrated settings despite their preference for \nless restrictive, more integrated settings (Am. Comp. ¶¶ 149-53, 169-70). \n  Plaintiffs’ conclusory claims are totally speculative and unsupported by evidentiary facts \nconcerning any of the named plaintiffs.  As explained in Sections I.C. and I.D. above, plaintiffs \nhave not alleged any facts to support a claim that the CMO has in the past or is currently placing \n- 37 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 37 of 46   Document 71 \n\nFamily Care enrollees without due regard for their needs and protected rights, and there is no \nbasis whatever for a presumption that it will do so in the future.  No claim for which relief can be \ngranted is stated.  \n6.  Counts Four and Eight fail to state claims for which \nrelief can be granted. \n  Count Four (ADA) and Count Eight (Rehab Act) allege that the fixed capitation rate and \nthe methods used to determine provider rates fail to provide an individualized determination of \nservices  needed  to  place  and  maintain  Milwaukee  County  residents  aged  60  or  older  with \ndisabilities  in  appropriate  and  integrated  residential  services  of  their  choice  (Am.  Comp. \n¶¶ 154—56, 172-74). \n  The essence of these claims seems to be that the State defendants’ policies, procedures \nand rates related to Family Care funding will not result in plaintiffs’ future placement in (1) \nappropriate and integrated residential services (2) of their unrestricted choice.  As to point (1), \nplease see Arguments I.C. and I.D. above.  As to point (2), there is no basis in law for plaintiffs \nto claim injury based on a purported unilateral right to choose their own residential settings. \nSection  1396n(c)(2)(C)  of  the  Medicaid  statute  requires  that  all  similarly  situated  waiver \nparticipants be “informed of the feasible alternatives, if available under the waiver, at the choice \nof  such  individuals,  to  provision  of  inpatient  hospital  services,  nursing  facility  services  or \nservices in an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded.”  As a matter of law neither \nFamily Care nor other waiver recipients have a protected, unlimited right to choose residential \nfacilities.  The plaintiffs therefore fail to allege any actionable discrimination. \n  Also, the Amended Complaint sets forth only generalized and conclusory allegations \nregarding failure to provide individualized determination of services needed for placement of \n- 38 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 38 of 46   Document 71 \n\nFamily  Care  members.    These  speculative  claims  are  not  supported  by  facts  relating  to \nindividualized determination of service needs for any of the plaintiffs in this lawsuit, as further \nexplained in Section I.C. above. \n  Furthermore, the State defendants’ responsibility for providing Milwaukee County with \nactuarially sound capitation rates does not include either setting provider rates or making an \nindividualized  determination  of  services  needed  by  participants,  both  of  which  are  the \nresponsibility  of  the  Milwaukee  County  CMO  pursuant  to  the  CMO  contract  (Exhibit  2, \npage 15).  Plaintiffs’ complaints about allegedly inadequate provider rates or individual service \ndeterminations therefore fail to state any claim for relief against the State defendants. \nC.  Count  9  fails  to  state  a  claim  based  on  42  U.S.C. \n§ 1396(a)(30)(A). \n  Count  9  attempts  to  set  forth  a  claim  based  on  the  Medicaid  statute,  42  U.S.C. \n§ 1396a(a)(30)(A), which provides: \n   [A state plan for Medical Assistance must] provide such methods and \nprocedures relating to the utilization of, and the payment for, care and services \navailable under the plan . . . as may be necessary to safeguard against unnecessary \nutilization of care and services and to assure that payments are consistent with \nefficiency,  economy,  and  quality  of  care  and  are  sufficient  to  enlist  enough \nproviders so that care and services are available under the plan at least to the \nextent that such care and services are available to the general population in the \ngeographic area. \n \nId. (emphasis supplied).  In Count 9, plaintiffs refer to the italicized language of the statute as the \n“adequate rate and equal access” provisions20 of (a)(30)(A) (see Am. Comp. ¶ 182).  In the two  \n                                                 \n  20There seems to be no common shorthand for describing the provisions of (a)(30)(A) to \nwhich plaintiffs refer although, for the sake of brevity, the cases most commonly refer to these \nprovisions together as simply to the “equal access” provisions.  See, e.g., Clark v. Richman, \n339 F. Supp.2d 631, 638 (M.D. Pa. 2004).  When broken into two concepts, the first is often \nreferred to as the “quality of care” provision.  See Pennsylvania Pharmacists Assn. v. Houstuon, \n- 39 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 39 of 46   Document 71 \n\nsucceeding paragraphs, plaintiffs set forth conclusory allegations that the capitated rates set by \nthe State defendants and paid to Milwaukee County for the years 2000 through 2005 have been \ninadequate to assure that payments to Family Care AFH and CBRF providers and to providers of \nday services to residents of such facilities are adequate and sufficient, tracking the italicized \nlanguage of the statute almost word for word (id. ¶¶ 183-184). \n  Count 9, together with the rest of the amended complaint, fails to state a claim for relief \nbased on the quality of care and equal access provision of (a)(30)(A) for several reasons.  First, \nfor purposes of retroactive monetary relief, neither DHFS nor Secretary Nelson in her official \ncapacity are “persons” who are subject to suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  See Arizonans for \nOfficial English, 520 U.S. at 69-70 n. 24; Will, 491 U.S. at 71.   \n  Secondly, there is significant room for debate as to whether the provisions of (a)(30)(A) \nare  sufficient to create a statutory right in favor of either recipients or providers which is \nenforceable under § 1983, based on the requirements articulated by the Supreme Count most \nrecently in Gonzaga University v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 279-286 (2002); see also Blessing v. \nFreestone,  520  U.S.  329,  340-343  (1997).  Cases  following  Gonzaga  acknowledge  that \npre-Blessing cases recognizing that MA recipients or providers have a private right of action \nunder § 1983 are open for re-examination.  See Westside Mothers, et al. v. Olszewski, et al., \n2005 WL 1027987 *4-*15, __ F. Supp.2d __ (E.D.Mich. 2005) (re-examining prior decisions \nrecognizing private right in light of Gonzaga; finding no right of action for recipients); Sanchez \nv. Johnson, 301 F. Supp.2d 1060, 1063 (N.D. Cal. 2004) (on reconsideration following Gonzaga, \nholding that recipients did not have private right of action); OKAAP, et al. v. Fogarty, et al., \n                                                 \n283 F.3d 531, 538-44 (3rd Cir. 2002)(en banc).  This argument will refer to the “quality of care” \nand “equal access” provisions. \n- 40 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 40 of 46   Document 71 \n\n366 F. Supp.2d 1050, 1102-04 (N.D. Ok. 2005) (analyzing cases; holding that recipients but not \nproviders have right of action under (a)(30)(A)); cf. Long Term Care Pharmacy Alliance v. \nFerguson, 362 F.3d 50, 56-58 (2004) (re-examines prior precedent; held: providers do not have \nprivate right of action, but rationale may affect recipients as well); In re. NYAHSA Litigation, \n318 F. Supp.2d 30, 39-40 (N.D.N.Y. 2004) (recipients are intended beneficiaries; no private right \nof action for providers).   \n  The question of whether recipients have a private right of action under (a)(30)(A) and \n§ 1983 is noted to the court here, however, primarily for purposes of preserving the issue for \nreview.  Because the State defendants presume that this court will consider itself bound by \nSeventh Circuit precedent pre-dating Blessing, which expressly recognized a private right of \naction for providers based on (a)(30)(A),21 they will not challenge in this Court plaintiffs’ claim \nthat plaintiffs have a private right of action based on the equal access provisions of (a)(30)(A). \n   Assuming, arguendo, that MA recipients have a private right of action under (a)(30)(A) \nhowever, it is highly unlikely that plaintiffs can rely on (a)(30)(A) alone as the basis to state a \nclaim challenging the adequacy of the Family Care capitated rates, as plaintiffs seek to do in \nCount 9.  Cf. Clayworth v. Bonta, 295 F. Supp. 1110, 1124-1126 (E.D. Cal. 2003) (despite \nfinding private right of action benefiting recipients under (a)(30)(A), the court concluded that \nneither MA recipients nor providers had private right of action to challenge capitated rates under \nthe  managed  care  waiver  provisions  of  42  U.S.C.  §  1396n(b)  and  the  applicable  federal \n                                                 \n  21See Methodist Hospitals v. Sullivan, 91 F.3d 1026, 1029 (7th Cir. 1996) (held: providers \nhave  a  private  right  of  action  to  enforce  “equal  access”  provision  of  (a)(30)(A)); see also \nAmerican Society of Consultant Pharmacists, et al. v. Garner, 180 F. Supp.2d 953, 969, 977 \n(N.D. Ill. 2001) (post-Blessing; following Methodist Hospitals; suggesting that providers’ right \nof action is derivative of patients’ rights to quality of services). \n \n- 41 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 41 of 46   Document 71 \n\nregulation, 42 C.F.R. § 438.(6)(c)).22  After all, the components of Family Care are approved as a \nmanaged  care  program  under  the  waiver  provisions  of  §  1396n(b),  “waivers  to  promote \ncost-effectiveness and efficiency,” and as a prepaid health plan as well as a HCBS waiver under \n§ 1396n(c).  See nn. 3 and 4, above and citations therein, including the CMO Contract (Ex. 2002) \nat  121,  ¶  18  and  Ex.  2003-D(1).    Plainly,  applying  fundamental  principles  of  statutory \nconstruction, the Court must strive to interpret all of the requirements of the federal statutes and \ninterpretative rules that apply to Family Care, including (a)(30)(A), in harmony with one another. \n  Most  importantly  for  present  purposes,  the  Family  Care  capitated  rates,  on  which \nplaintiffs focus their primary attack, must comply with the “actuarial soundness” requirements of \n42 C.F.R. § 438.6, which imposes various requirements on contracts for managed care and \npre-paid health plans.  See 42 C.F.R. § 438.6(a).   Among the central requirements of that rule \napplicable to Family Care are the requirements of § 438.6(c) that the payments by DHFS to CMO \nproviders, including the Milwaukee County CMO, must comply with the detailed standards for \n“actuarially  sound  capitation  rates”  as  defined  in  subsec.  438.6(C)(1)(i)  and  set  forth  in \nsucceeding provisions of that rule, including subsecs. 438.6(c)(2) and (3).  Subsec. (c)(2)(i) \nprovides unequivocally that “[a]ll payments under risk contracts and all risk-sharing mechanisms \nin contracts must be actuarially sound,” while subsec. (3) contains the specific requirements that \nthe “actuarially sound” DHFS rates must meet.   \n                                                 \n  22Because plaintiffs assert a private right of action based solely on (a)(30)(A) and ignore \nthe managed care waiver requirements of 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(b) as well as the actuarial soundness \nrequirements  of  the  federal  regulations  governing  capitated  rates,  the  State  defendants  will \naddress plaintiffs’ claim in the context of arguing that they do not state a claim for relief \nconcerning the capitated rates under (a)(30)(A).  Clayworth, however, is clear well-reasoned \nprecedent  addressing  why  the  waiver  provisions  of  §  1396n(b)  are  relevant  and  why  MA \nrecipients  do  not  have  enforceable  rights  to  attack  managed  care  capitated  rates  based  on \n§ 1396n(b).  See Clayworth, 295 F. Supp.2d at 1124-26.  \n- 42 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 42 of 46   Document 71 \n\n  Because the detailed requirements for actuarial soundness of 42 C.F.R. § 438.6 govern \nthe capitated rates DHFS pays CMO providers, the State defendants submit that, at a minimum, \nin order to state a claim under (a)(30)(A) directly attacking the capitated rates of a managed care \nwaiver, as plaintiffs seek to do, the complaint must set forth facts alleging that the rates are not \n“actuarially sound.”  Yet Count 9 of the Fourth Amended Complaint—indeed, the complaint as a \nwhole—completely ignores the applicable, detailed requirements of § 438.6(c) and does not \nallege, even in conclusory fashion, that the DHFS capitated rates are not actuarially sound.   \n  Furthermore, if one construes the actuarial soundness requirements in conjunction with \nthe “quality of care” language of (a)(30)(A), on which plaintiffs rely, plaintiffs must adequately \nallege that the capitated rates “are [in]consistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care” as \nwell as “[in]sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services are available under the \nplan at least to the extent that such care and services are available to the general population in the \ngeographic area” see id. Count 9 should be dismissed for failure to state a claim for that reason \nalone.   \n  In any event, assuming one can ignore the federal standards the DHFS capitated rates \nmust meet for purposes stating a claim that the rates are inadequate under (a)(30)(A), the utterly \nconclusory allegations of the complaint fail to set forth facts that are even minimally sufficient to \nstate a claim under that statute.   \n  With regard to the requirement that the payments be consistent with “quality of care,” \nplaintiffs do not allege any deficiencies in the quality of the care they are currently receiving.  \nThe bald assertions to the effect that Family Care rates may at some point in the future allegedly \nbecome  inadequate  to  assure  quality  of  care  is  nothing  more  than  conclusory  speculation, \ninsufficient to support an inference that, in fact, this will come to pass. \n- 43 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 43 of 46   Document 71 \n\n  In an apparent attempt to support a claim under the final “equal access” requirement of \n(a)(30)(A), plaintiffs do allege that some providers have threatened to stop providing Family \nCare services and, in the case of HIL, one of the providers serving the plaintiffs, the provider \nactually did serve the Milwaukee County CMO with notice that it intended to terminate its \nFamily Care contract.  But the termination of a single provider contract is a far cry from—and \nnot remotely the equivalent of—alleging  facts sufficient to demonstrate that so many providers \nwill terminate their services (and will not be replaced with other willing providers) that plaintiffs \nand their putative class will not have access to community-based residential long term care \nservices “at least to the extent that such care and services are available to the general population \nin  the  geographic  area,”  as  the  statute  requires.    While  ¶¶  183  and  184  of  the  Amended \nComplaint  repeat  the  statutory  language  in  conclusory  fashion,  there  are  simply  no  facts \nanywhere in the complaint to support the conclusory allegations.   \n  As the Seventh Circuit indicated in Methodist Hospitals, Inc., any rights enforceable \nunder  (a)(30)(A)  are  substantive  rather  than  procedural;  the  statute  “requires  each  state  to \nproduce a result, not to employ any particular methodology for getting there.”  Id. at 1030.  \nCount 9 of the Fourth Amended Complaint does not adequately allege that the results required of \nFamily Care—that the payments be consistent with quality of care and sufficient to insure access \nto Family Care services by recipients to the extent that such care and services are available to the \ngeneral population in the geographic area—will not be delivered.  In short, Count 9 fails to state \na claim actionable under (a)(30)(A). \nCONCLUSION \n  For the reasons discussed above, the Fourth Amended Complaint must be dismissed for \nlack  of  jurisdiction  because  plaintiffs  lack  standing  or  because  the  claims  are  not  ripe  for \n- 44 - \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 06/15/05   Page 44 of 46   Document 71 \n\nadjudication.  In the alternative, the complaint must be dismissed because it fails to state claims \nfor  relief  under  the  ADA,  the  Rehabilitation  Act  or  the  Medicaid  statute,  42  U.S.C \n§ 1396(a)(30)(A) enforceable under § 1983.  In addition, claims for retroactive declaratory and \nmonetary relief  against the State defendants, other than claims based on the Rehabilitation Act \n§ 504, are barred by sovereign immunity and the Eleventh Amendment.  \n  Dated this 15th day of June, 2005. \n  Respectfully submitted, \n \n  PEGGY A.

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nEASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n \nGERALD N., et al., \n       \nPlaintiffs, \n \n    v.              Case No. 04-C-1093 \n \n \nMILWAUKEE COUNTY, \n       \n      Defendant. \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n \nDEFENDANT MILWAUKEE COUNTY’S BRIEF IN OPPOSITION TO \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n \n  The plaintiffs are disabled individuals over the age of 60 who are clients of the Family \nCare program, see, Wis. Stat. ss. 46.2805-2895, administered by the Milwaukee County \nDepartment on Aging.    Family Care is a pilotp rogram which the State of Wisconsin has \nimplemented in five counties and, for eligible disabled persons enrolled in the program, it \nessentially replaces a variety of Medicaid waiver programs as a mechanism to fund the care and \nservices necessary to maintain those persons in community placements.   \n  The owner of the CBRF where the plaintiffs are placed requested an increase in the \nmonthly payment he receives from Family Care to serve the plaintiffs.  When that request was \ndenied, he served notice that he would evict the plaintiffs, and the Family Care program \nproceeded to locate alternative community placement for than and to plan for their transition to \nthose placements.  The plaintiffs, by their guardians, have sued, claiming that the refusal of the \nFamily Care program to increase payments to the CBRF owner and the fact that he receives \nhigher payment for some under-60 residents whose care is financed by the traditional Medicaid \nwaiver programs constitute violations of various federal statutory and constitutional rights. \n\n  The Family Care program has advised the plaintiffs and their guardians that the program \nintends to move them to their new residences in the near future, and the plaintiffs now seek a \npreliminary injunction to prevent those moves. \nI.  To obtain preliminary injunctive relief, plaintiffs must prove each element of a                                              \nfive-part test. \n \n  The standard applicable to a motion for a preliminary injunction is well settled :\nThe Court of Appeals for this circuit has held that a party seeking preliminary \ninjunctive relief must show that (1) no adequate remedy at law exists; (2) the \nmoving party will suffer irreparable harm absent injunctive relief; (3) the \nirreparable harm suffered in the absence of injunctive relief outweighs the \nirreparable harm the defendant will suffer if the injunction is granted; (4) the \nmoving party has a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits; and (5) the \ninjunction will not harm the public interest. United States v. Rural Electric \nConvenience Co-Op. Co., 922 F.2d 429, 432 (7th Cir. 1991); Somerset House, \nInc. v. Turnock, 900 F.2d 1012, 1014 (7th Cir. 1990); Baja Contractors, Inc. v. \nCity of Chicago, 830 F.2d 667, 675 (7th Cir. 1987),  cert. denied, 485 U.S. 993, \n99 L. Ed. 2d 511, 108 S. Ct. 1301 (1988). In order to prevail, the plaintiff must \nsatisfy each element of this five-part test. Somerset, 900 F.2d at 1015 (citing \nRoland Machinery Co. v. Dresser Industries, Inc., 749 F.2d 380, 386-87 (7th Cir. \n1984)). \nDavids v. Coyhis, 857 F.Supp. 641, 646 (E.D. Wis. 1994).   \nIn practice, the “reasonably likelihood of success on the merits” standard presents a fairly \nmodest threshold, and the amount of “irreparable harm” required to obtain relief is, to some \nextent, a function of the countervailing harm which will be suffered by the defendant if the \ninjunction is granted.  However, those factors do not convert the plaintiffs’  motion into the \nfunctional equivalent of an “order to show cause”, requiring the defendant to prove that the \nplaintiffs are not entitled to an injunction.   The burden remains on the plaintiffs to establish each \nand every element of the test.  \nII.  Plaintiffs cannot establish that they have no adequate remedy at law. \nThe essence of the complaint is this case is that the guardians of the named plaintiffs do \nnot want their wards moved  from the CBRF’s in which they now reside to different CBRF’s \nwhere (the evidence will show) they will receive care and services equivalent to the care and \n  2 \n\nservices which they now receive.   The proposed moves were precipitated by the stated intention \nof the owner of the CBRF’s where the plaintiffs now live to evict the plaintiffs because the \nFamily Care program denied his request for more money.   For reasons discussed in the \nsucceeding sections of this memorandum, this scenario does not implicate the federal statutory \nrights of the plaintiffs.  However, the court does need not reach that issue because there are \nadequate state law procedures which will permit the plaintiffs to interpose their objcetions if the \nproposed moves do not result in the least restrictive placements commensurate with their needs \nof if they operate to deprive the plaintiffs of necessary care, treatment or support items.  \nAs clients of the Family Care program, the plaintiffsh ave a specific statutory right to \nobject, and to obtain a hearing on their objection, if Family Care benefits are denied or \nterminated or if the “plan of care” (which describes the array of services the program proposes to \nprovide) is “unacceptable because the plan of care requires the enrollee to live in a place that is \nunacceptable to the enrollee or the plan of care provides care, treatment or support items that are \ninsufficient to meet the enrollee’s needs, are unnecessarily restrictive or are unwanted by the \nenrollee,”  Wis. Stat. s. 46.287(2)(a)1.f.   Moreover, as persons subject to orders for guardianship \nand protective placement under Wis. Stat. chs. 880 and 55, the plaintiffs are entitled to an annual \nreview by the probate court, State ex rel. Watts v. Combined Community Services, 122 Wis. 2d \n65, 362 N.W.2d 104 (1985).  This procedure provides an opportunity for periodic judicial review \nof the adequacy and appropriateness of the plaintiffs’ placements.     \nIII.  The plaintiffs have no reasonable likelihood of success on the merits. \nThe plaintiffs have chosen to rely on their claims under the Americans With Disabilities \nAct (ADA), 42 U.S.C. s. 12132 et seq., and the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. s. 794(a), in \nsupport of their motion for preliminary injunctive relief.    \n  3 \n\nThe viability of the of those claims depends upon the proposition that the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act, and in particular the “integration principle” articulated in the implementing \nregulations, 28 CFR s. 35.130(d) and 28 CFR s. 41.51(d), empower the federal courts to \nmicromanage programs for the disabled.  They do not.  “The purpose of the regulation is not to \nconstitute the federal courts the supervisors of the care and treatment of disabled persons.  It is to \nprevent the isolation or segregation of the disabled.”  Bruggeman v. Blagojevich, 324 F.3d 906, \n911 (7th Cir. 2003).    \nThe evidence in this case will not support a finding that the policies of the Family Care \nprogram threaten to isolate or segregate the plaintiffs or any other disabled person.  The Family \nCare program has served notice that it intends to move the plaintiffs from the CBRF’s where \nthey currently live to other CBRF’s, where they will have the same plans of care and will receive \nthe same array of treatment, services and support they are receiving now.  There is no plan or \nintention to institutionalize or re-institutionalize the plaintiffs or anyone else, and there is no \nbasis for a finding that a move from one CBRF to another will result in confinement in a more \nrestrictive institution.    \nThe plaintiffs’  brief quotes dicta from the Bruggeman decision in which the Court of \nAppeals admits the theoretical possibility that if an aging parent of an adult disabled child is \nunable adequately to care for that disabled child, placement in the parent’s home may \n“realistically” be more restrictive that an appropriate institutional placement.  In that hypothetical \ncircumstance, which is not presented in this case, the disabled adult child’s entitlement to the \nleast restrictive environment consistent with his needs might be implicated.  However, that aside \nby the Court of Appeals is insufficient to support the plaintiffs’ claim that a move from one \nCBRF to another functionally identical CBRF can be characterized as a“ more restrictive” \n  4 \n\nplacement (and therefore a violation of the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA as explicated in \nOlmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999)) merely because it would place a disabled person in a \ntemporarily unfamiliar environment.  There is no authority which holds that the right to the “least \nrestrictive” environment is that broad.     \nThis is not, as plaintiffs suggest, a “reasonable accommodation” case.  A “reasonable \naccommodation” is one that gives an otherwise qualified plaintiff with disabilitie“s meaningful \naccess” to a program or service.   Alexander v. Choate, 496 U.S. 287, 301 (1985).  That concept \ncannot reasonably by applied to the operation of the Family Care program as it affects the \nplaintiffs in this case because the benefits of the Family Care program are available only to the \ndisabled, and the plaintiffs are currently receiving those benefits.  The plaintiffs are arguing that \nthey are entitled to a “reasonable accommodation” which would permit them to remain in the \nsame CBRF forever, irrespective of cost or any other factor.  Milwaukee County does not offer \nany program or service to the non-disabled, or to anyone else, which guarantees perpetual \nplacement in the same residential facility.  \nMoreover, even if the notion of “reasonable accommodation” were applicable in this \ncase, Milwaukee County cannot be compelled to make that accommodation.  Under the ADA, a \npublic entity is not required to make an accommodation which “would fundamentally alter the \nnature of the service, program, or activity,” 28 CFR s. 35.130(b)(7).  Similarly, under the \nRehabilitation Act, a requested accommodation is not required if it “creates a fundamental \nalteration in the nature of the program” or creates “undue financial or administrative burdens”. \nThe essential and defining feature of the Family Care program is that it is a managed care \nprogram.   The Department on Aging, in its capacity as the “care maintenance organization” \nadministering the program, receives a capitated (per enrollee-per month) payment from the State \nof Wisconsin, and it is required to meet the identified needs of all eligible persons through the \n  5 \n\njudicious purchase of residential and support services and the like with that limited source of \nfunds.  The plaintiffs are asking the court to permit a particular provider of residential services \n(in this case, a provider who is already the most expensive CBRF provider in the program) to, in \neffect, extort higher rates from Milwaukee County by threatening to evict Family Care clients if \nthose higher rates are not paid.  If the court empowers providers to engage in such conduct by \nforbidding the Family Care program to provide alternative appropriate residential and support \nservices on the theory there is a federal right under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act to remain in \nthe same CBRF forever (which is, for the reasons discussed above, a dubious proposition), the \nprogram’s ability to manage care and control costs would be eliminated.    That would certainly \n“fundamentally alter” the nature of the program and would create “undue financial or \nadministrative burdens” within the meaning of the applicable regulations .\n \nIV.  “Irreparable harm”. \nThe plaintiffs have offered no authority which relieves them of the requirement to prove \n“irreparable harm” as a condition precedent to obtaining preliminary injunctive relief in a case \nunder the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act.   Whether they meet that burden will, of course, \ndepend upon the evidence adduced at the hearing.  However, if “irreparable harm” means \nanything, it must mean more than mere inconvenience or the temporary disruption of settled \nroutine.  The court should not assume that moving one of the plaintiffs from one CBRF to \nanother will result in trauma so profound, permanent and debilitating as to constitute \n“irreparable” harm unless that harm is established by compelling, relevant expert testimony .\nThe evidence will establish that, in the case of a Family Care client who faced the same \nsituation as the plaintiffs and who has already been relocated to a new CBRF, there has been no \n  6 \n\nirreparable harm.  On the contrary, the client appears to be receiving more attentive care in the \nnew facility \nV.  Harm to defendant Milwaukee County. \n  To claim, as the plaintiffs do, that granting temporary injunctive relief to them will do no \nharm to Milwaukee County is to ignore the true nature and objective of this case.  This is not a \ncase about the integration mandate of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.  The plaintiffs are \nalready deinstitutionalized and will remain so.  The plaintiffs are tatempting to package an attack \non the managed care aspect of the Family Care program as an ADA case.  Milwaukee County \nrespectfully urges the court to decline the plaintiffs’  invitation to litigate the fiscal and policy \njudgments of the State of Wisconsin and Milwaukee County which are inherent in the \nformulation and implementation of that program. \n  Courts have recognized that even cases which involve genuine ADA issues raise \n“complex medical, social and fiscal issues not easily addressed by litigatio”n and implicate “both \nfiscal and policy choices that are difficult to make”, Williams v. Wasserman, 164 F. Supp. 2d \n591, 595 and 637 (D. Md. 2001).  A state’s obligation to comply with the integration mandate of \nthe ADA and the Rehabilitation Act is limited tot he resources available in the state’s mental \nhealth budget, and, in allocating that budget among numerous disabled individuals who need \ncare and services, the state “is entitled to wide discretion in adopting is own systems of cost \nanalysis”, Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 615.   \n  The State of Wisconsin and Milwaukee County have chosen to allocate the limited \nresources available for community-based residential services, care and treatment of disabled \npersons over the age of 60 by means of a managed care system known as Family Care.   That \nchoice is well within the ambit of the discretion permitted to state and local authorities under \nOlmstead and subsequent cases.  The fact that the program may, in some cases, provide a lower \n  7 \n\nrate to a particular CBRF provider than he receives for disabled persons under 60 years of age \nwhose care is financed under the traditional Medicaid waiver programs does not violate the ADA \nor the Rehabilitation Act, and it does not warrant judicial intervention in the administration of \nthat program. \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, Milwaukee County respectfully submits that that the plaintiffs \nhave not met the standards necessary to demonstrate that they are entitled to the extraordinary \nremedy of preliminary injunctive relief.  Accordingyl, Milwaukee County urges the court do \ndeny the plaintiffs’  motion for a preliminary injunction .\n  Dated at Milwaukee, Wisconsin this 13th day of April, 2004. \nOFFICE OF CORPORATION COUNSEL \n            /s/ John Jorgensen \nBy:___________________________________ \nJohn Jorgensen \nPrincipal Assistant Corporation Counsel \nState Bar No. 01017484 \nAttorneys for Defendant \n \nP.O.

      "title": "PLAINTIFFS' BRIEF IN OPPOSITION TO STATE DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO DISMISS AND IN OPPOSITION TO MILWAUKEE COUNTY'S MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS",
      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nEASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n \nGERALD NELSON, et al., \n \n        Plaintiffs, \n \n    vs.              Case No. 04-C-0193 \n \nMILWAUKEE COUNTY, et al.,  \n \n        Defendants. \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n \nPLAINTIFFS' BRIEF IN OPPOSITION TO STATE DEFENDANTS'  \nMOTION TO DISMISS AND IN OPPOSITION TO MILWAUKEE  \nCOUNTY'S MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \n  The State and County defendants have each filed motions to dismiss plaintiffs' fourth \namended complaint. The motions assert that plaintiffs have failed to state legal claims upon \nwhich relief can be granted and also that the plaintiffs lack standing to make these claims. The \nmotions to dismiss based on legal sufficiency were anticipated and plaintiffs actually welcome \nthe opportunity to clarify these dispositive issues before going forward with the process of class \ncertification and further discovery. That was the whole purpose of the stipulation that resolved \nthe pending motion to file the fourth amended complaint. It was hoped that clarifying the issues \nwould in turn simplify the class certification decision. In addition, the State seeks to dismiss one \naspect of the case based on Eleventh Amendment immunity. This was also anticipated.        \n  Unfortunately, the defendants' other assertion that the case should be dismissed for lack \nof standing creates some unanticipated procedural issues. Standing in class actions is determined \nwith reference to the class as a whole rather than simply looking at the potential impact on the \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 07/22/05   Page 1 of 29   Document 77 \n\nnamed plaintiffs. Pursuant to the stipulation, plaintiffs' class motion has been denied with leave \nto refile after these pending motions are decided. This creates an endless procedural loop. Rather \nthan return immediately to the class motion, plaintiffs have a suggestion for resolving this \nawkward  situation.  First,  the  Court  should  consider  whether  the  allegations  in  the  fourth \namended complaint support standing based only on the claims of the individual plaintiffs. If so, \nthe plaintiffs will prevail on standing without further analysis. If not, the second step would be to \ndetermine whether the class allegations in the complaint support standing based on the claims of \nthe putative class. Once again, if this step is satisfied, the plaintiffs simply prevail on standing. If \nnot, the only proper course is to deny the defense standing motions at this time with leave to \nrefile after plaintiffs' request for class certification is decided. \n  The  procedure  governing  the  other  aspects  of  the  defense  motions  is  much  more \nstraightforward. The Court can conduct its customary inquiry into whether the claims are legally \nsufficient and whether plaintiffs can prove any set of facts in support of the allegations of the \ncomplaint. Plaintiffs are filing three affidavits and a number of exhibits at this time. The purpose \nof these affidavits and plaintiffs' previous submissions is not to convert the pending motions into \nmotions for summary judgment, but rather to show that plaintiffs will be able to prove facts in \nsupport of their fourth amended complaint. \n  Plaintiffs will first review the legal basis under each of the three applicable statutes since \nthis will simplify the later discussion of standing and the State's Eleventh Amendment defense. \nThe plaintiffs have alleged legally sufficient claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act, \n§504 of the Rehabilitation Act and 42 U.S.C. §1396(a)(30)(a), and will be able to prove a set of \nfacts in support of these claims. The plaintiffs have standing to bring these claims and the \nEleventh Amendment does not present any obstacles to the relief that they are seeking. \n  2\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 07/22/05   Page 2 of 29   Document 77 \n\nSTATEMENT OF ISSUES \nI.

[Dkt 1]. The only parties were Plaintiffs Nelson and Bzdawka and Defendant \nMilwaukee County. Id. Two additional plaintiffs living in homes operated by the same provider \nwere added in the first amended complaint on April 13, 2004. [Dkt 18]. Milwaukee County then \nraised the issue of the State's participation as a necessary party and that led to the second \namended complaint on April 30, 2004. [Dkt 23]. A third amended complaint added additional \nplaintiffs. [Dkt. 37]. Two of them, Lenore Czarnecki and John Gorton, are served by another \nresidential provider, but the issues are similar. Other plaintiffs added at that time who receive \ndifferent types of Family Care services were subsequently dismissed as part of a stipulation in \norder to limit the issues in the case. [Dkt. 50]. Counsel attempted to reach a stipulation defining \nthe legal issues further in order to avoid a further amendment, but were not successful. This led \nto a motion to amend in order to permit the filing of a fourth amended complaint. [Dkt. 51]. A \nclass certification motion was also filed at this time. [Dkt. 54]. Counsel were then able to reach a \nstipulation permitting the amendment and suggesting a roadmap for further proceedings. [Dkt. \n58].  Defense  counsel  insisted  that  dispositive  motions  be  heard  first  and  that  the  class \ncertification issue be deferred and that is what the stipulation provided. [Dkt. 67]. The State and \nCounty defendants have now filed their motions to dismiss. [Dkt. 68 & 70].    \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n  The factual history provided by the State defendants is a reasonably complete summary \nof the factual allegations and issues in the case. This is intended to supplement the State's version \nrather than to replace it. Plaintiffs are filing three affidavits along with this brief. There is a \nsupplemental affidavit from Lincoln Burr, executive director of Homes for Independent Living. \n  4\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 07/22/05   Page 4 of 29   Document 77 \n\n[Burr-II]. Plaintiffs Nelson, Bzdawka, Ehrlichman and Berdikoff live in HIL homes. There is an \naffidavit from Dr. Gerald Kallas, president of Senior Residential Care of America. [Kallas]. \nPlaintiffs Czarnecki and Gorton live in SRCA homes. There is also an affidavit from Thomas \nCook, an expert on disability services and disability funding programs. [Cook]. The following \nwill also reference portions of previous affidavits and other submissions. \nFunding Developments at the State and County Level \n    The  State  increased  Milwaukee  County's  Family  Care  comprehensive  rate  from \n$1,810.61 for calendar year 2004 to $2,055.01 for calendar year 2005.  www.dhfs.state.wi.us/ \nLTCare/StateFedReqs/CapitationRates.htm. This is the second highest rate increase in the history \nof Family Care. [Cook: ¶36]. However, most of the other Family Care counties still receive \nhigher rates in comparison to Milwaukee. For example, the comprehensive rates for 2005 are: \nFond du Lac County - $2,120.74, La Crosse County - $1,828.82, Portage County - $2,320.75 and \nRichland County - $2,140.30. The \"intermediate\" rates which covers many fewer individuals, \nthose who have lesser services needs, are the same for all counties and are as follows: 2001 - \n$628.79, 2002 - $640.00, 2003 - $657.40, 2004 - $674.49, 2005 - $691.35. (All of this data is \nfrom the above- referenced web page.) \n  In the wake of the rate increase, residential providers in Milwaukee County anxiously \nawaited word on how the Milwaukee County Department on Aging (MCDA) would allocate the \nfunds locally. Much of what we know about this comes from MCDA informational meetings for \nproviders that were held on February 15 and March, 2005. Staff from Senior Residential Care of \nAmerica (SRCA) attended the meeting and reported what was said. The memo, dated March 16, \n2005 was previously filed as attachment A to the second Pledl affidavit. [Dkt. 53]. It will be \n  5\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 07/22/05   Page 5 of 29   Document 77 \n\nreferenced as the \"SRCA memo\" or as Pledl II-Ex. A. The following quotations from the memo \nare pertinent to the issue of provider payments: \n•Family Care is currently trying to no longer require Family Care providers to complete a \nfinancial audit each year. This is based on the idea that, since a company's financial \nstanding will no longer determine the payments received to care for a resident, financial \naudits \"are an unnecessary expense.\" [page 7] \n \n•Regarding [MCDA staff's] views on how businesses are expected to coexist with an \n\"entitlement program\" like Family Care, [she] stated: \"I have found that businesses need \nto go bankrupt at least two times before they learn how to run a CBRF properly.\" [page \n8] (emphasis in memo) \n \n•Some meeting attendees stated that potential residents were now moving into Milwaukee \nCounty and signing over their money and assets to their family members so that they can \nqualify  to  receive  Family  Care  funding.  [MCDA  staff]  stated  that  she  (and  almost \neveryone else in Family Care) knows that this practice is rampant (even though she \nadmits that it is \"illegal\"). She further admitted that Family Care \"is doing nothing at this \ntime to try to stop this illegal practice.\" [Id.]  \n \n• . . . [MCDA staff] stated that all newly constructed facilities have operating costs that \nare too high and will not be able to afford accepting Family Care residents. [Id.] \n \n•Although new facilities may offer nicer environments and amenities, \"this does not equal \na benefit to the FC residents,\" Therefore, facilities with higher costs may not be able to \noffer FC housing.\" [Id. at 13] \n \n• . . . if the facilities don't receive enough compensation from FC, then we \"should get \nmore private pay residents\" to help cover our operating costs. [Id. at 14] \n \n• . . . because there is no private pay industry to offer DD care services, programs that \noffer care services for DD's receive greater financial support than care programs for \nseniors. [Id.]  \n \n  MCDA staff at these meetings also explained that a new \"functional\" method would be \nused to set provider rates beginning in April of 2005. [Id. at 7]. Plaintiffs' counsel recently \ninquired about why the new functional rate method had not been implemented. Atty. Jorgensen \nresponded by letter dated July 18, 2005: \nMeanwhile, Family Care has been directed to refrain from granting across-the-\nboard rate increases unless and until the County Board approves such increases. \nWe assume that such approval will depend on, among other things, a satisfactory \n  6\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 07/22/05   Page 6 of 29   Document 77 \n\narrangement to establish risk reserves and to repay Family Care deficits which \nhave been covered by tax levy revenues. \n \n[Cook-Ex. I].  \n The Effect of Funding Developments on Residential Providers \n  Dr. Kallas is the CEO of Senior Residential Care which is the residential provider for two \nof the plaintiffs. His affidavit summarizes the unsuccessful efforts to obtain a Family Care rate \nincrease at SRCA's Milwaukee County CBRFs by working with MCDA, [Kallas:¶¶16-19, 23-\n35], other providers, [¶¶20-21], and the State Legislature. [¶26 & Ex. D]. SRCA's Milwaukee \nCounty Family Care rate has been $2,700 per month since 2001. [¶17]. Waukesha County is not \nin Family Care and SRCA's facility there has operated with a monthly Medicaid waiver rate of \n$3,500 per month for identical services. [¶15]. Dr. Kallas reported that in a survey of other \nresidential providers, 80% of the respondents said they were being paid below their cost of care. \n[¶20-21]. He has spoken with bankers who expressed a reluctance to finance residential facilities \nin the County because of the perception that Family Care is unstable and underfunded. [¶43]. As \nDr. Kallas said on December 10, 2004: \"SRCA will be forced to consider leaving the Family \nCare Program at some point duing 2005 if we do not receive a significant rate increase. [¶44]. \n  Lincoln  Burr  is  Executive  Director  of  Homes  for  Independent  Living  which  is  the \nprovider for four of the plaintiffs. His previous affidavit detailed the early stages of HIL's \nproblems  with  MCDA  over  rate  issues.  [Dkt.  56].  His  second  affidavit  describes  the \ncircumstances of HIL's entry into Milwaukee County: \nHIL developed these homes beginning in the mid-90's. HIL and Paragon were \nencouraged by the State to enter the County in order to serve individuals with \nmore severe disabilities that were being transferred from the State Centers for the \nDevelopmentally Disabled and other institutions into community placements. The \nState and County had experienced difficulty in placing these individuals with \nexisting programs in the County because they had significant behavioral and/or \nmedical  issues.  HIL  negotiated  generally  higher  rates  for  these  individuals \n  7\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 07/22/05   Page 7 of 29   Document 77 \n\ncompared to existing residential providers in the County based on the need to \narrange more intensive staffing patterns and utilize more highly trained staff. \n \n[Burr II: ¶7]. The second affidavit goes on to describe the current funding situation. HIL and its \nassociated day program, Paragon, have historically received cost of living increases from the \nMilwaukee County Disabilities Services Division, which serves clients under age 60, and from \nother Wisconsin counties. [Burr I: ¶19]; [Burr II: ¶¶9-10]. The total annual shortfall for the six \nMilwaukee  Family  Care  clients  in  HIL  homes  is  now  $18,899.70  when  compared  to  the \nMilwaukee DSD average rate and $52,187.70 when compared to the average rate paid by other \ncounties. [Burr II: ¶4]. Milwaukee DSD has worked with HIL on a procedure to bill for MA \npersonal care services that will increase the DSD effective rate to about the same level as the \nother counties. [Burr II: ¶9 & 11].  \n  It has now been five years without a rate increase from MCDA for either HIL or Paragon \nas additional DSD clients continue to age into Family Care. [Burr II: ¶¶8, 13, 14 & 15]. Mr. Burr \nsays that HIL and Paragon have been able to remain in operation in Milwaukee County despite \nthe MCDA rate problems because of their operations in other counties. [Burr II: ¶20]. \"However, \nwe will be forced to reconsider our continued subsidy of MCDA in the near future. We cannot \nsubsidize Family Care clients. Unless we receive significant rate increases, we will be forced to \nterminate our contract with MCDA.\" Id.  \n  Thomas Cook is an expert in the field of disability services and funding systems with \npersonal experience in Milwaukee County. [Cook: ¶¶2-11 and Ex. A]. It is his conclusion that \nthe share of Milwaukee Family Care dollars going to residential providers in 2004 was too low \nand that the situation got even worse in 2005. [Cook: ¶43-45]1. CBRFs are legitimately one of \n                                                 \n1 There is a variance between the 2005 capitated rate of $1,975.88 reported by the County in an email, \n[Cook - Ex. H], and the $2,055.01 rate listed on the DHFS website. Plaintiffs do not have an explanation \nfor this. Using the higher figure would make the percentage allocated to providers even lower. \n  8\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 07/22/05   Page 8 of 29   Document 77 \n\nthe most costly services in any system and it appears they are not receiving adequate payments \nfrom Family Care. [¶47]. Part of the basis for this conclusion came from the affidavits of Dr. \nKallas and Mr. Burr. He noted that both SRCA and HIL are receiving higher rates for similar \nservices from other counties and, in the case of HIL, higher rates from another part of the same \ncounty, DSD. [¶24-25]. In general, large providers are able to cover losses in a particular \nsegment of their operations for a time, but for various reasons they must then either reduce or \neliminate the segment that is losing money. [¶26]. Mr. Cook said: \nThe  rate  problems  with  MCDA  would  cause  any  large  provider  to  consider \nreducing or eliminating the number of Family Care clients. It is reasonable to \npredict that SRCA and HIL will leave Milwaukee County Family Care if rates do \nnot  improve.  Other  large  providers  in  Milwaukee  County  are  probably \nconsidering this option. \n \n[¶27]. Due to inflation, five years without a rate increase \"actually represents a substantial \ndecrease in effective provider income.\" [¶29]. \n  Mr. Cook noted that the plight of smaller residential providers is somewhat different. \nThey usually cannot move to another county or pursue higher-rate clients from other counties in \ntheir Milwaukee homes and so they will simply cease operations if rates are not adequate. [Cook: \n¶28]. In order to determine whether the rate structure was having any effect on providers, \nplaintiffs  arranged  for  a  Milwaukee  accounting  firm  to  gather  data  from  audited  financial \nstatements filed by Milwaukee County residential providers. [¶30]. The data was then evaluated \nby  John  Villegas-Grubbs,  an  expert  on  disability  funding  systems  from  Arizona.  Id.2  His \nconclusion is that small providers in Milwaukee County are in serious financial condition and \nthat many no longer have \"going concern\" status. [Cook: ¶31]. Larger providers are in better \nfinancial condition according to their audited financial statements, a fact that Mr. Cook attributes \n                                                 \n2 Gathering the data from the County was a lengthy process. Then Mr. Villegas-Grubbs had to perform his \nevaluation which was then subjected to a peer review process. Mr. Cook has reviewed a draft report and \nspoke to Mr. Villegas-Grubbs. Plaintiffs will submit the actual documents once they are received.  \n  9\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 07/22/05   Page 9 of 29   Document 77 \n\nto their ability to subsidize their Milwaukee County operations from other sources. [¶¶31-32]. \nMr. Cook was very critical of MCDA for planning to dispense with the audit requirement. [¶48]. \n\"Small providers in the County are in a financial crisis. The County should continue to collect \nthis data in order to monitor the adequacy of the residential provider rates.\" Id.  \n  He also disagreed with the implication by MCDA staff that CBRF business failures were \nthe provider's fault. [¶47]. Based on a variety of factors, \"[b]ankruptcies among Milwaukee \nCounty providers are more likely to be caused by low rates rather than the business abilities of \nthe provider.\" Id. Mr. Cook recognized that Milwaukee County has some legitimate reasons for \nwanting to use the money from the 2005 rate increase to establish a risk reserve and reimburse \nthe tax payers. [¶49]. He then said: \"However, regardless of the County's rationale, the likelihood \nof wide-spread business failures and larger providers leaving Family Care make it imperative \nthat  at  least  some  of  the  increased  State  funding  should  go  to  the  residential  providers \nimmediately.\" Id.         \nThe Effect of Funding Developments on the Clients of Residential Providers \n  Significant planning and effort goes into selecting the right residential setting for a \nparticular person with a disability. [Burr I: ¶10]. Once they are in their new home, '[c]lients \ndevelop attachments to other clients and to particular staff members in the CBRF and at their day \nprogram. The whole purpose is to develop a sense of living and working together as a family and \nthis actually does occur.\" [¶12]; see [Kallas: ¶10]; and see [Cook: ¶52]. According to Mr. Cook's \naffidavit, this is one of the main reasons that transfers are so traumatic: \n(52)  Transfers between community-based programs put clients at risk for a \nnumber of reasons. Such transitions are not just transfers between facilities as \nwould be the case if someone moves from a hospital bed to a nursing facility. \nThey involve the loss of the person's home with all that implies. Clients lose \nrelationships with other residents and staff who know them well. In moving, they \nlose their place in a \"family\", a neighborhood and a community. \n  10\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 07/22/05   Page 10 of 29   Document 77 \n\n(53)  It  is  almost  a  certainty  that  some  of  the  Plaintiffs  will  need  to  be \ninstitutionalized if this matter is not resolved to the satisfaction of the providers \nand discharge and contract termination procedures go forward. The more severe \nheir disabilities or intense their support needs, the higher the risk is for adverse \nplacement outcomes for the Plaintiffs. \n \nTransfers  between  community  placements  generally  have  a  higher  failure  rate  than  other \ntransfers. [Cook: ¶51]. Mr. Cook concluded that being transferred to other residential settings \nwill expose all of the individual plaintiffs \"to an imminent threat of institutionalization\". [¶65]. \nMr. Burr made a similar statement with respect to HIL's clients. [Burr II: ¶23].  \n ARGUMENT \nI.  Plaintiffs have stated claims upon which relief can be granted under the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act and §504 of the Rehabilitation Act. \n  \nInvoking \"the sweep of congressional authority, including the power to enforce \nthe fourteenth amendment and to regulate commerce,\" the ADA is designed \"to \nprovide  a  clear  and  comprehensive  national  mandate  for  the  elimination  of \ndiscrimination against individuals with disabilities.\" §§12101(b)(1), (b)(4).  \n \nTennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 516 (2004). Congress had passed §504 of the Rehabilitation \nAct in 1973 without an extensive statement of intent and purpose. However, two years after \npassage of the ADA, Congress revisited §504 and added virtually identical findings about the \npersistent problems causing disability discrimination in America.  Pub.L. No. 102-569, §106, \n106 Stat. 4346 (1992) (codified in 29 U.S.C. §701).  Those findings include the following: \n(5)  individuals with disabilities continually encounter various forms of \ndiscrimination in such critical areas as employment, housing, public \naccommodations, education, transportation, communication, recreation, \ninstitutionalization, health services, voting, and public services; and \n \n(6)  the goals of the Nation properly include the goal of providing individuals \nwith disabilities with the tools necessary to -- \n \n(A)  make informed choices and decisions; and \n \n  11\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 07/22/05   Page 11 of 29   Document 77 \n\n(B)  achieve equality of opportunity, full inclusion and integration in \nsociety, employment, independent living, and economic and social self-\nsufficiency, for such individuals. \n \n29 U.S.C. §701(a).  \n  Plaintiffs'  claims  under  the  ADA  and  §504  will  be  discussed  together  because  the \nmethods of proving discrimination are imported from one to other. Wisconsin Correctional \nService v. City of Milwaukee, 173 F.Supp. 2d 842, 849 (E.D. Wis. 2001). The only significant \ndifference is that §504 is limited to public entities that receive Federal financial support while \nTitle II of the ADA applies to all public entities without regard to funding source. Id. Both \nMilwaukee County and DHFS receive Federal funds. \n  Numerous  cases  brought  under  the  ADA  and  §504  involve  various  aspects  of  the \nMedicaid  program.  In  one  such  case  the  defendants  argued  that  in  approving  the  waiver \napplication, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services had somehow insulated the  \nState from liability under the ADA and §504. The court disagreed, holding: \nThe HCFA waivers upon which the State relies neither could have exempted \nQUEST  from  the  ADA  and  the  RA,  nor  purported  to  do  so.  Section  1315 \nauthorizes the DHHS to waive various provisions of the Medicaid statute, but it \ndoes not mention the ADA or the RA. See also 28 C.F.R. §35.190(b)(3) (charging \nthe  DHHS  with  implementing  Title  II  compliance  procedures  for  programs \nrelating to the provision of health care and social services.  \n \nLovell v. Chandler, 303 F.3d 1039, 1056 (9th Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1105 (2003). \n  Defendants  in  cases  under  the  ADA  and  §504  may  assert  a  fundamental  alteration \ndefense based on legitimate governmental interests, however, this can rarely be determined on a \nRule 12(b)(6) motion. Michelle P. v. Holsinger, 356 F.Supp.2d 763, 770-1 (E.D. Ken. 2005). \nProvided that plaintiffs are seeking adjustments to an existing program rather than the creation of \nan entirely new program, \"whether the relief requested would result in a fundamental alteration \n\"is a matter that can be resolved only by a careful examination of the facts and circumstances'.\"  \n  12\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 07/22/05   Page 12 of 29   Document 77 \n\nId., quoting Martin v. Taft, 222 F.Supp.2d 940, 975 (S.D. Ohio 2002); see Radaszewski v. \nMaram, 383 F.3d 599, 614 (7th Cir. 2004) (\"This is not an assessment that can be made on the \npleadings.\") \n  As  the  following  sections  will  discuss,  plaintiffs'  complaint  states  legally  sufficient \nclaims under the ADA and §504 and their factual submissions3 demonstrate that they will be able \nto prove facts in support of those claims.  \n  A.  Intentional discrimination and disparate impact under the ADA and §504. \n  The ADA prohibits classic discrimination involving differential treatment of persons with \ndisabilities in comparison to persons without disabilities, Bay Area Addiction Research v. City of \nAntioch, 179 F.3d 725, 735 (9th Cir. 1999), and policies that have a disparate impact on persons \nwith disabilities, Regional Economic Action Program, Inc. v. City of Middleton, 294 F.3d 35, 48 \n(2d Cir. 2002). Facially discriminatory government policies, without more, are sufficient to \nestablish intentional discrimination. Lovell v. Chandler, 303 F.3d at 1057. When a government \nentity (a State in that instance), \"facially discriminates against the disabled, it is chargeable with \nnotice  that  federal  rights  are  implicated  by  such  discrimination.\"  Id.  Any  claim  that \ndiscriminatory animus is required is simply wrong. Also, it is not necessary that plaintiffs show \ndiscrimination  in  comparison  to  the  general  population.  Unlike  other  previous  civil  rights \nstatutes, the ADA and §504 also prohibit differential treatment within groups of individuals who \n                                                 \n3 The pending motions do not seek summary judgment, and so it is important to define the role of the \naffidavits and exhibits that plaintiffs have filed. Submissions of this type are made \"not for evidentiary, \nbut rather for illustrative purposes -- that is, not to establish the truth of their contents, but to show that \nthere might be a set of facts consistent with [the] allegations in the complaint.\" Thomas v. Guardsmark, \nInc., 381 F.3d 701, 704 (7th Cir. 2004). Plaintiffs believe the factual matters in the submissions are \nsignificant evidence, however, this is immaterial in the context of the pending motions. Dismissal \"is \nproper only if there is no state of facts consistent with the complaint that would entitle the plaintiffs to \nrelief. In submitting the [allegedly objectionable document], the plaintiffs were merely indicating that, \nyes, there may well be facts they could prove that would show they had a claim.\" Hart v. Sheahan, 396 \nF.3d 887, 895 (7th Cir. 2005) (citations omitted).      \n  13\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 07/22/05   Page 13 of 29   Document 77 \n\nall have disabilities. Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 598 (1999); Henrietta D. v. Bloomberg, 331 \nF.3d 261, 275-6 (2nd Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 936 (2004). This also applies to cases \nthat seek systemic modifications in Medicaid-funded programs. Makin v. Hawaii, 114 F.Supp.2d \n1017, 1033 (D. Hawaii 1999).  \n  The plaintiffs have alleged in Counts One and Five that: \nFamily Care policies, procedures and rates relating to funding for AFHs, \nCBRFs and day programs for persons in AFHs and CBRFs as developed and \nimplemented by DHFS, Secretary Nelson and Milwaukee County have in the past \nand continue to intentionally discriminate and have a disparate impact under the \nADA [and §504] because: \n \n(A)  Milwaukee County residents with disabilities who are 60 \nyears of age and older receive substantially inferior treatment in regard to \npayment  for  services  in  adult  family  homes  (AFH),  community-based \nresidential facilities (CBRF) and day programs for persons in AFHs and \nCBRFs in comparison to Milwaukee County residents with disabilities \nwho under the age of 60 whose services are funded by the Community \nOptions  Program  (COP),  Community  Integration  Program  (CIP)  and \n(Brain Injury Waiver (BIW) programs instead of Family Care.  \n \n(B)  Milwaukee County residents with disabilities who are 60 \nyears of age and older receive substantially inferior treatment in regard to \npayment for services in AFHs, CBRFs and day programs for persons in \nAFHs and CBRFs in comparison to persons with disabilities of any age \nwho are residents of other counties that are not participating in Family \nCare and whose services in non-Family Care counties are funded by the \nCOP, CIP and BIW programs. \n \n(C)  Milwaukee  County  residents  with  more  significant \ndisabilities who are served by Family Care receive substantially inferior \ntreatment in regard to payment for services in AFHs, CBRFs and day \nprograms for persons in AFHs and CBRFs in comparison to persons with \nless significant disabilities that are served by Milwaukee County Family \nCare. \n \n[4th Amd. Cmplt., ¶¶143 & 162]. Each of these three subparts supplies a clear legal basis for a \nfinding of discrimination. \n  14\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 07/22/05   Page 14 of 29   Document 77 \n\n  The plaintiffs, who are 60-and-over MCDA Family Care clients have alleged that they \nare treated differently in comparison to under-60 clients of Milwaukee County. They have \nalleged a significant funding disparity between the two groups that will ultimately cause the loss \nof their homes for the plaintiffs and many members of the putative class. [4th Amd. Cmplt. ¶¶33-\n36, 58-64]. The same portions of the complaint allege that Milwaukee Family Care clients are \nbeing treated differently than other similar individuals in other counties with similar effect. Id. \nFinally, the plaintiffs allege that as persons with more significant disabilities, they are being \ntreated differently in comparison to individuals with lesser disabilities in Family Care. Id. Each \nof these represents classic differential treatment that is actionable as intentional discrimination or \ndisparate treatment under the ADA and §504. \n  B.  Effective access to public services under the ADA and §504.  \n  The ADA and §504 also require public entities to administer their programs in certain \nways to ensure full access by persons with disabilities. 28 C.F.R. §35.130(b). Once again, \ndiscrimination in relation to a comparison group is not required in order to prevail. \"A plaintiff \ncan prevail either by showing 'discrimination' or by showing 'deni[al, of] the benefits' of public \nservices.\" 42 U.S.C. §12132, Henrietta D., 331 F.3d at 276. \"[T]he statute itself does not literally \nrequire a showing of 'discrimination'.\" Id. The actionable conduct must, however, be by reason of \nthe plaintiffs' disabilities, Id. at 279, but that is not an obstacle here.  \n  Counts two and six allege: \n(148)  Family Care policies, procedures and rates relating to funding for \nAFHs, CBRFs and day programs for persons in AFHs and CBRFs as developed \nand implemented by DHFS, Secretary Nelson and Milwaukee County have in the \npast violated and continue to violate the ADA because they aid or perpetuate \ndiscrimination against persons with disabilities and prevent them from obtaining \nthe  same  result,  gaining  the  same  benefit  or  reaching  the  same  level  of \nachievement in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs and have the \n  15\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 07/22/05   Page 15 of 29   Document 77 \n\npurpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the \nobjectives of the Family Care and Medicaid programs. \n \n[4th Amd. Cmplt., ¶¶148 & 166]. The same allegations referenced above would also support a \nfinding that the plaintiffs are being denied effective access to public services. \n  C.  The integration requirements of the ADA and §504.  \n  Plaintiffs are discussing their claims in the order that they appear in the complaint, but in \nmany ways this is the most compelling. It is not necessary to show discrimination in comparison \nto another group under Olmstead, so even if the persons with disabilities in either Milwaukee \nCounty or the State of Wisconsin were also in Family Care, the plaintiffs could still pursue their \nclaims  that  various  systemic  changes  are  necessary  to  prevent  their  unnecessary \ninstitutionalization. \n  The integration claim is based on the following regulation: \nA public entity shall administer services, programs, and activities in the most \nintegrated  setting  appropriate  to  the  needs  of  qualified  individuals  with \ndisabilities. 28 CFR §35.130(d) (1998). \n \nAnother part of the DOJ Regulations defines \"most integrated setting\" as \"a setting that enables \nindividuals with disabilities to interact with non-disabled persons to the fullest extent possible.\" \n28 CFR pt. 35, App. A, p. 450 (1998). §504 also contains an integration requirement which is \n\"materially identical\" to the corresponding ADA provision. Bruggeman, 324 F.3d at 911-2. \n  The  United  States  Supreme  Court  held  that  States  must  provide  \"community-based \ntreatment\" in lieu of institutional confinement to persons who choose that option. Olmstead, 527 \nU.S. at 607. However, the integration clause is not limited to individuals in institutions that are \ntrying to get out. It also applies to claims brought by individuals living in the community to \nincrease the funding levels for certain services or to modify the provisions of disability funding \n  16\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 07/22/05   Page 16 of 29   Document 77 \n\nprograms where there is a risk of future institutionalization.  Fisher v. Oklahoma Health Care \nAuthority, 335 F.3d 1175, 1181-1182 (10th Cir. 2003).  \n  Counts three and seven allege: \nFamily Care policies, procedures and rates relating to funding for AFHs, \nCBRFs and day programs for persons in AFHs and CBRFs as developed and \nimplemented by DHFS, Secretary Nelson and Milwaukee County have in the past \nviolated and continue to violate the integration requirements of the ADA because \nthey substantially increase the probability that Milwaukee County residents with \ndisabilities who are 60 and over will be placed in more restrictive, less integrated \nsettings despite their preference for less restrictive, more integrated settings. \n \n[4th Amd. Cmplt., ¶¶153 & 171]. There are specific allegations for each plaintiff that they are \nlikely to be institutionalized due to forced moves from their residential providers. [¶¶78-79].   \nThe complaint also lays out the specifics of the funding dispute and how the rate issue is causing \nthe providers to terminate their contracts with Family Care. [¶¶56-64, 72-77]. This is similar to \nthe chain of causation leading to institutionalization submitted in Fisher. 335 F.3d at 1184-1185. \nPlaintiffs have stated a claim under the integration requirements of the ADA and §504.  \n  D.  Reasonable accommodation under the ADA and §504. \n  This issue requires only a brief discussion. Plaintiffs are not requesting an individualized \nplaintiff by plaintiff modification of Family Care that is different for each person as in some \nreasonable accommodation situations. They seek an overall modification of Family Care policies \nand changes in overall funding like in Olmstead. That means the fundamental alteration defense \nis balanced against the needs of the entire client population rather than just a few applicants. 527 \nU.S. at 605-606. This issue is subsumed in the above discussions of discrimination, access and \nintegration. Based on the timing of the decision in Wisconsin Community Service v. City of \nMilwaukee,  ---  F.3d  ---,  2005WL1523215  (7th  Cir.  June  29,2005),  plaintiffs  do  not  know \nwhether the defense will be arguing in their reply briefs that it has some bearing on this case. It \n  17\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 07/22/05   Page 17 of 29   Document 77 \n\ndoes not. The present case involves allegations of widespread discrimination that would meet the \nmajority's standard in WCS. Also, the plaintiffs in WCS have requested en banc review and the \nSeventh Circuit has requested that the City file a response to the petition. \nII.  Plaintiffs have stated a claim upon which relief can be granted under 42 U.S.C. \n§1396(a)(30)(A) of the federal Medicaid statute. \n \n  Plaintiffs have also brought a claim under 42 U.S.C.§1983 alleging a violation of 42 \nU.S.C. §1396a(a)(30)(A). The State recognizes that this phase of the case must go forward based \non controlling Seventh Circuit precedent. Methodist Hospitals, Inc. v. Sullivan, 91 F.3d 1026 \n(7th Cir. 1996). The County does not agree so the issue does require some discussion.   \n  The federal Medicaid statute provides: \nA  State  plan  for  medical  assistance  must  .  .  .  provide  such  methods  and \nprocedures relating to the utilization of, and the payment for, care and services \navailable under the plan . . . as may be necessary to safeguard against unnecessary \nutilization of such care and services and to assure that payments are consistent \nwith efficiency, economy, and quality of care and are sufficient to enlist enough \nproviders so that care and services are available under the plan at least to the \nextent that such care and services are available to the general population in the \ngeographic area; . . . \n  \n42 U.S.C. §1396a(a)(30)(A). Participation in the Medicaid program is voluntary, but once a state \ndecides to do so, it must abide by all applicable federal requirements and standards Wilder v. Va. \nHosp. Ass'n, 496 U.S. 498, 502 (1980). A claim may be brought under 42 U.S.C. §1983 to \nremedy a violation of a Federal statute provided that the statute unambiguously confers an \nindividual right. Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 283 (2002).  \n  Prior to Gonzaga, the Seventh Circuit had held that \"providers of medical care have a \nprivate right of action, derived through §1983, to enforce §1396(a)(30).\" Methodist Hospitals, 91 \nF.3d at 1029. Some courts had taken another approach, finding a right of action under (30)(A) \nonly as to Medicaid beneficiaries. Evergreen Presbyterian Ministries, Inc. v. Hood, 235 F.3d \n  18\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 07/22/05   Page 18 of 29   Document 77 \n\n908, 927 (5th Cir. 2000); Ark. Med. Soc'y, Inc. v. Reynolds, 6 F.3d 519, 526 (8th Cir. 1993). \nObviously, the plaintiffs here are beneficiaries, not providers, and they would be allowed to \nproceed even under the more restrictive approach.  \n  Various cases since Gonzaga have found a private right of action to enforce 42 U.S.C. \n§1396a(a)(30)(A). In Memisovski v. Maram, 2004WL1878332 (N.D. Ill. 2004), District Judge \nLefkow conducted an exhaustive review of the case law and concluded that recipients had a \nprivate right of action to enforce §1396a(30)(A) and other Medicaid provisions. Ball v. Biedness, \n2004 WL2566262 (D. Ariz. 2004), found a private right of action under (30)(A) on behalf of \nrecipients to challenge funding shortages in a community care program. Clayworth v. Bonta, 295 \nF.Supp.2d 1110, 1124 (E.D. Cal. 2003), also found a private right of action under (30)(A) \nspecifically for recipients, but not providers, to challenge a 5% reduction in rates paid in the \nCalifornia Medi-Cal program. (However, Sanchez v. Johnson, 301 F.Supp.2d 1060, 1064 (N.D. \nCal. 2004), held that (30)(A) does not create a private cause of action.)  \n  Sabree v. Richman, 367 F.3d 180, 193-194 (3rd Cir. 2004), another case containing an \nexhaustive review of the case law after Gonzaga, found a private right of action under several \nother Medicaid provisions other than (30)(A). Michelle P. v. Holsinger also involved different \nMedicaid provisions and allowed the case proceed on those claims as well as under the ADA and \n§504. 356 F.Supp.2d at 760-770. \n  Most of the factual allegations in the complaint, most of the affidavits and most of the \nother documents submitted by the plaintiffs and the defendants concern the rate issue and its \neffect on residential providers in Milwaukee County. There is no need to catalogue them in detail \nhere. The complaint is clearly sufficient. The affidavits and other documents set out a clear \n  19\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 07/22/05   Page 19 of 29   Document 77 \n\npattern of Family Care rate problems that are affecting providers and especially the retention of \nproviders which is one of the specific elements of 42 U.S.C. §1396a(a)(30)(A).  \nIII.  The individual plaintiffs, as well as the members of the putative class, have standing \nto bring the legal claims set out in the fourth amended complaint. \n \n  “[F]ederal courts have a ‘virtually unflagging obligation’ to exercise the jurisdiction \nconferred on them by Congress.”  Sverdrup Corp. v. Edwardsville Community Unit School Dist. \nNo. 7, 125 F.3d 546, 549 (7th Cir. 1997) quoting Colorado River Water Conservation District v, \nUnited States, 424 U.S. 800, 817 (1976). Standing is absent only where it is impossible for a \ncourt to grant \"any effectual relief whatever.\" Church of Scientology v. United States, 506 U.S. 9, \n12 (1992). To satisfy the case or controversy requirement of Article III, “a plaintiff must allege:  \n(1) an 'injury in fact' (2) fairly traceable to the Defendants’ conduct (3) that a favorable federal \ncourt decision likely would redress or remedy.”  Oak Ridge Care Center, Inc. v. Racine County, \n896 F.Supp. 867, 871 (E.D. Wis. 1995), citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 \n(1992).  Congress  frequently  expands  standing  in  connection  with  civil  rights  statutes,  see \nTrafficante v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., 409 U.S. 205, 212 (1972) (expanded standing \nunder Fair Housing Act), and has clearly done so in the ADA. Oak Ridge Care Center, 896 \nF.Supp. at 872.  \n  The outer limits of standing are represented by the \"tester\" situation. That is where an \nindividual does not even have any intent to avail him or herself of the item or activity in \nquestion, but pretends to seek it in order to determine whether an act of discrimination will \noccur. The United States Supreme Court had held in Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. \n363, 374 (1982), that the Fair Housing Act supported \"tester\" standing. According to Havens, the \nFHA statute \"creat[ed] legal rights, the invasion of which creates standing.\" Id. at 373. It is \n  20\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 07/22/05   Page 20 of 29   Document 77 \n\nenough for the tester to suffer this technical injury. The Tenth Circuit held that this analysis also \napplies to the ADA: \nThus, the totality of Title II's plain language, the plain language of its enforcement \nprovision, and the statutory scheme's anti-discrimination purpose lead this court to \nconclude that Congress intended Title II to confer standing to the full limits of \nArticle III. Cf. Havens Realty, 455 U.S. at 372-74, 102 S.Ct. 1114. \n \nTandy v. City of Witchita, 380 F.3d 1277, 1287 (10th Cir. 2004). The court held that the standing \nrequirements of §504 were equally expansive. Id. The Second Circuit had earlier reached the \nsame result in Innovative Health Systems, Inc. v. City of White Plains, 117 F.3d 37, 47 (2d Cir. \n1997). It held that use of the broad language, \"any person alleging discrimination\", in 42 U.S.C. \n§12133  essentially  dispensed  with  any  requirement  of  standing  beyond  alleging  an  ADA \nviolation. Id. As for the claims under 42 U.S.C. §1396(a)(30)(A), the Seventh Circuit has held \nthat the standing requirements under general Medicaid law, the ADA and §504 were similarly \nexpansive. Bruggeman v. Blagojevich, 324 F.3d 906, 910 (7th Cir. 2003) \n  Actions  for  declaratory  judgment  involve  the  lowest  standing  threshold.  “[I]n  some \ninstances a declaratory judgment is proper even though there are future contingencies that will \ndetermine whether a controversy ever actually becomes real.”  10B Wright, Miller & Kane, \nFederal Practice and Procedure, §2757, at 476 (3d ed. 1998). Judicial relief may be ordered \nbefore any harm occurs precisely “to avoid the dispute escalating into additional wrongful \nconduct.”  Dow Jones & Co., Inc. v. Harrods, Ltd., 237 F.Supp. 2d 394, 405 (S.D.N.Y. 2002).    \nA declaratory judgment may completely resolve a dispute or may be a “prelude” to other relief.  \nBontkowski v. Smith, 305 F.2d 757, 761 (7th Cir. 2002).  “[B]y seeking just the declaration the \nplaintiff avoids the burden of formulating and justifying a precise injunctive remedy.”  Id.  \n  21\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 07/22/05   Page 21 of 29   Document 77 \n\n  An injury \"in the probabilistic sense\" is all that is required to have standing to seek \ndeclaratory or injunctive relief. Cook, Inc. v. Boston Scientific Corp., 333 F.3d 737, 744 (7th Cir. \n2003). The Seventh Circuit has said: \n[S]tanding does not require a perfectly clear title to the claim sued upon.  United \nStates v. $557,933.89, More or Less, in U.S. Funds, 287 F.3d 66, 75, 78-79 (2d \nCir.2002);  United  States  v.  Rodriguez-Aguirre,  264  F.3d  1195,  1204  (10th \nCir.2001).  This is a corollary of the probabilistic character of the requirement of \nstanding,  upon  which  we  have  commented  in  other  cases,  such  as  Diaz  v. \nDuckworth, 143 F.3d 345, 347 (7th Cir.1998), and Price v. Pierce, 823 F.2d 1114, \n1118 (7th Cir.1987); see also Hohn v. United States, 262 F.3d 811, 818 (8th \nCir.2001).  “A reasonable probability that a plaintiff will get an apartment that he \nwants sooner if he wins his suit is a sufficiently tangible expected benefit of suit \nto confer standing under the liberal principles that prevail nowadays,” as we said \nin Price; . . . \n \nMorlan v. Universal Guar. Life Ins. Co., 298 F. 3d 609, 620 (7th Cir.2002). As the following \nsections will discuss, both the allegations in plaintiffs' complaint and their factual submissions \ndemonstrate a substantial likelihood that they will be harmed by the alleged violations of federal \nlaw that they have identified in the Family Care program. \nA.  Group home residents have a legitimate interest in continuing to live in a \nparticular home of their choice \n \n  At the heart of the standing issue is a fundamental disagreement between the plaintiffs \nand defendants about whether group home residents have an interest in remaining in a particular \nhome. MCDA considers Family Care clients to be like interchangeable pegs that can be moved \naround a board. However, the complaint alleges that group home residents have important \nassociations with others in the home and at their day programs that will be lost if they are shifted \nto another CBRF. [4th Amd. Cmplt. ¶¶21-22]. It also alleges that each of the plaintiffs will be \nindividually harmed. See [4th Amd. Cmplt. ¶¶78-79]. Each of the three affidavits addresses these \npoints. [Cook: ¶¶50-53]; [Burr-II: ¶¶21-23]; [Kallas: ¶¶10-13]. \n  22\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 07/22/05   Page 22 of 29   Document 77 \n\n  The defense point of view is just that, a point of view. Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged \nan interest in remaining in their homes that supplies standing in this case.4\n   B.  The individual plaintiffs have standing. \n  A Medicaid provider, \". . . has standing, along with the patients themselves, to challenge \nin federal court laws that forbid it to sell its services to potential customers or limit the prices it \ncan charge.\" Bethesda Lutheran Homes v. Leann, 122 F.3d 443, 444 (7th Cir. 1997) (citations \nomitted) (emphasis supplied). Medicaid recipients were held to have had standing to challenge \nvarious aspects of an Illinois Medicaid plan under 42 U.S.C. §1983, the ADA and §504 even \nthough the requested relief might not benefit actually benefit them: \nThey seek merely a plan, which might not lead to an increase in the ICF/DD \ncapacity in their immediate area. Even if it did, they might not benefit.   . . .    The \npotential benefit to them from the relief that they seek thus is speculative. \n \n  But  not  so  speculative  as  to  negate  standing,  which  is  a  matter  of \nprobabilities rather than certainties. North Shore Gas Co. v. EPA, 930 F.2d 1239, \n1242 (7th Cir. 1991). The suit seeks to remove a logjam that is preventing the \ncreation of facilities desired by the plaintiffs, and if the likelihood of success is \nconjectural so is the argument for failure based on the possibility that any new \nfacilities will be overwhelmed by other applicants. \n \nBruggeman, 324 F.3d at 910. This is a good description of the situation in virtually every \nMedicaid or Olmstead type case. The plaintiffs in Fisher avoided summary judgment on their \nintegration claim based on evidence of a \"high risk of premature entry into a nursing home.\" 335 \nF.3d at 1184.  \n                                                 \n4 There is another issue lurking here. The defendants have gone out of their way to paint an attractive \npicture of Family Care and all of its components. Their argument seems to be that Family Care will take \ncare of any problems caused by a transfer and residents have an appeal procedure to protect them. \nPlaintiffs are skeptical based on information such as that contained in the SRCA memo. However, the \nimportant legal issue is that there is no exhaustion requirement under the Title II and §504 so the plaintiffs \nare free to bring these claims regardless of the availability of an internal hearing or some other procedure. \nDertz v. City of Chicago, 912 F.Supp. 319, 324 (N.D. Ill. 1995). \n  23\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 07/22/05   Page 23 of 29   Document 77 \n\n  We have a wealth of information about the probabilities in this case based on the overall \nfunding  problems  in  the  Milwaukee  County  system.  There  are  separate  paragraphs  in  the \ncomplaint alleging the harm to each plaintiff. [4th Amd. Cmplt. ¶¶78-79, 89-90, 99-100, 108-\n109, 118-119, 126-127). We also have expert affidavit testimony that the individual plaintiffs are \nlikely to suffer harm including institutionalization. [Cook: ¶25]. This was found to be sufficient \nin Fisher, 335 F.3d at 1181-1182, and it is more than enough to supply individual standing here. \n  C.  The putative class members have standing. \n  Class actions frequently are aimed at a policy that limits access to a particular benefit, \neven where not all members could receive (or would even want) the desired object. For example, \nin a case involving a veterans hiring preference policy, the court noted that there were only a few \npotential jobs compared to the size of the class, but: \"[e]ach class member is better off when the \npreference is being enforced than when it isn’t. They may not get the job, but they are guaranteed \nthe preference.\" Veterans Legal Defense Fund v. Schwartz, 330 F.3d 937, 939 n.2 (7th Cir. \n2003); see Uhl v. Thoroughbred Technology and Telecommunications, Inc., 309 F.3d 978, 986 \n(7th Cir. 2002) (each class member had 50% chance of suffering the harm). In the same vein: \nWhen the government erects a barrier that makes it more difficult for members of \none class to obtain a benefit than it is for members of another group, a member of \nthe former group seeking to challenge the barrier need not allege that he would \nhave obtained the benefit but for the barrier in order to establish standing. The \n\"injury in fact\" in an equal protection case of this variety is denial of equal \ntreatment resulting from the imposition of the barrier, not the ultimate inability to \nobtain the benefit. \n \nNortheastern Florida Chapter of the Associated General Contractors of America v. City of \nJacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 666 (1993). \n  The plaintiffs have alleged all of the elements of a class action. [4th Amd. Cmplt. ¶¶129-\n137]. If necessary, the Court can look to these in order to determine standing using a larger \n  24\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 07/22/05   Page 24 of 29   Document 77 \n\npotential pool of individuals that are likely to suffer harm. Based on the allegations of the \ncomplaint and the affidavits, large numbers of persons with disabilities in Milwaukee County are \nnow facing and will in the future face the same loss of established residences as the individual \nplaintiffs due to the rate policies in Family Care. \nD.  If  the  issue  cannot  be  resolved  in  plaintiffs'  favor  at  this  stage  of  the \nproceedings, the portion of the defense motions relating to standing should \nbe denied with leave to refile after class certification is resolved.  \n   \n  Plaintiffs contend that the standing question can be decided in their favor based entirely on \nthe allegations in the complaint and that this final step is unnecessary. However, if the Court reaches \nthis stage, it should deny the State's motion in regard to standing and take up the class certification \nissue. Deciding whether a case may be maintained as a class action is \"the first order of business.\" \nHart v. Michael Sheahan, 396 F.3d  at 894 (citations omitted). Class certification must be resolved \nprior to any issues of standing. Payton v. County of Kane, 308 F.3d 673, 681 (7th Cir. 2002). \nPlaintiffs  had  agreed  with  the  defense  that  it  would  be  more  efficient  to  hold  the  class \ncertification issue in abeyance until the issues concerning the legal sufficiency of the fourth \namended complaint were decided. Obviously, this will not work if the answer to the standing \nquestion depends on the existence of a certified class. In that event, the standing question should \nbe deferred until after plaintiffs renew their motion and the class certification issue is resolved.   \nII.  Plaintiffs' claims for injunctive relief which may result in an order directing the \nState defendants to increase future capitated rates payable to Milwaukee County \nare not barred by the Eleventh Amendment. \n \n  There are three exceptions to the Eleventh Amendment bar against suits naming states or \nstate  agencies  as  defendants:  (a)  where  the  state  has  consented  to  suit  in  federal  court.  \nAtascadero State Hosp. v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 238 (1985); Marie O. v. Edgar, 131 F.3d 610, \n615  (7th  Cir.  1997);  (b)  where  a  party  sues  a  state  official  for  prospective  injunctive  or \n  25\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 07/22/05   Page 25 of 29   Document 77 \n\ndeclaratory relief from an ongoing violation of federal law, Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 159-\n60 (1908); and (c) where Congress has properly abrogated state immunity, Seminole Tribe of \nFlorida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 55-6 (1996). \n  A.  There is no State immunity for claims under §504. \n  Voluntary  participation  in  a  funding  program  authorized  by  Congress  waives  state \nimmunity. Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. at 65. The Seventh Circuit has held that §504's funding \nmechanism does create a valid waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity and that it may be \nenforced in federal court against state agencies.  Stanley v. Litscher, 213 F.3d 340, 344 (7th Cir. \n2000). The State acknowledges this. (State Brf., at 23). A plaintiff may seek compensatory \ndamages directly from a State agency under §504. Even if the demand that future Family Care \nrates must account for past shortfalls in Milwaukee County should present problems under the \nplaintiffs' other legal theories, it may proceed under the Rehabilitation Act. \n  B.  Ex  Parte  Young  permits  an  action  for  injunctive  relief  against  the  State \ndefendants under all three federal statutes. \n \n  A suit for injunctive relief against State officials is one of the specific exceptions to \nEleventh Amendment immunity.  Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. at 159-60. The Ex Parte Young \ndoctrine comes into play at the pleading stage and does not include any analysis of the merits.  \nVerizon Maryland, Inc. v. Public Service Comm. of  Maryland, 535 U.S. 635, 646 (2001), citing, \nIdaho v. Coeur d’Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U.S. 261, 281 (1997).  A court need only conduct a \n“straightforward inquiry into whether [the] complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law \nand seeks relief properly described as prospective.”  Coeur d’Alene, 521 U.S. at 296; Ameritech \nCorp. v. McCann, 297 F.3d 582, 587 (7th Cir. 2002). The actual role of the state official is not \ncrucial. Suits of this type \"generally represent only another way of pleading an action against an \nentity of which an officer is an agent.\" Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 165 (1985).  \n  26\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 07/22/05   Page 26 of 29   Document 77 \n\n  Ex Parte Young applies not only to violations of constitutional law, but also to suits \nalleging violations of federal statutory law, Verizon, 535 U.S. at 648 (Telecommunications Act), \nand more specifically to cases brought under the ADA and §504. Bruggeman, 324 F.3d at 912. \n  The distinction between prospective relief and past damages is not as clear as \"night and \nday.\" Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 667 (1974). A State may be ordered to conform its \nconduct  to  federal  law  without  trespassing  on  \"the  \"Eleventh  Amendment  even  though \naccompanied by a substantial effect on the state treasury.\" Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 278 \n(1986).  The  Ninth  Circuit  found  no  Eleventh  Amendment  obstacle  in  a  case  by  Medicaid \nrecipients claiming that tobacco settlement proceeds were being miss-allocated by the State. \nCardenas v. Anzai, 311 F.3d 929, 938 (9th Cir. 2002). It held that \"[t]he fact that the plaintiffs' \nclaims depend in part upon past conduct by the state . . . is not dispositive.\" Id.     \n  As discussed elsewhere, the complaint alleges violations of the ADA, §504 and the \nMedicaid statute that are clearly ongoing and expected to continue into the foreseeable future. \nThe  relief  sought  is  not  \"damages\"  since  plaintiffs  are  seeking  no  financial  payments  to \nthemselves. The case does involve financial payments going forward and plaintiffs have included \nin their prayer for relief \"that future rates set by the State defendants include an amount sufficient \nto alleviate the shortfall in Milwaukee County's Family Care program caused by inadequate \ncapitated rates from 2000 through the present.\" [4th Amd. Cmplt., Conclusion ¶¶F &G]. If \nplaintiffs prevail, this Court will be entering an order directing the State to cease any violations \nof federal law and conduct itself accordingly. This would include how it expends funds in the \nfuture and any proper consideration of rates for Milwaukee County disability providers would \nhave to include the effect of past-underfunding in order to have any validity. This does not \nconvert plaintiffs' claims for prospective relief into a damages claim. \n  27\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 07/22/05   Page 27 of 29   Document 77 \n\n  The court's decree in Ball v. Biedess provides an excellent example of the type of order \nthe plaintiffs are seeking here. The principal provision says:  \nIt is further ordered that the AHCCCS program must offer a rate of pay to health \ncare workers so as to deliver adequately those services for which each individual \nqualifies;  that  is,  to  attract  enough  health  care  workers  to  deliver  all  of  the \nservices for which an individual qualifies. \n  \n2004 WL2566262.  The defendants still retain substantial authority about how to effectuate the \norder. The Arizona district court also allowed the parties to submit proposals for an effective date \nfor the relief order which is an excellent idea in any systemic litigation. Assuming the entry of \nsome similar relief in this case, there will be no immunity problem. More importantly at this \nstage  as  required  by  Verizon,  the  relief  requested  in  the  complaint  does  not  implicate  the \nEleventh Amendment      \nC.  Plaintiffs are not pursuing any ADA or Medicaid claims other than those \ncoming under the Ex Parte Young doctrine. \n \n  Plaintiffs believe that Congress did validly abrogated State immunity in Title II under the \nstandard  in  Tennessee  v.  Lane.  Abrogation  under  the  Medicaid  statute  is  a  more  difficult \nquestion. However, neither of these issues will be here because the State defendants would be \nable to take an immediate appeal from a ruling in the plaintiffs' favor. This would create an \nunfortunate delay. The providers who serve the clients in this case are concerned about their \nwelfare and they are staying with the Family Care program as long as possible. This will not \ncontinue.  Plaintiffs  can  obtain  the  relief  they  seek  under  the  ADA  and  42  U.S.C. \n§1396a(a)(30)(A) by way of the Ex Parte Young doctrine. They may seek any potential relief \nunder §504 unencumbered by the Eleventh Amendment.     \n  28\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 07/22/05   Page 28 of 29   Document 77 \n\nCONCLUSION\n  The defendants have a huge burden here. They must show that the claims are legally \ninsubstantial or that plaintiffs cannot prove any set of facts in support of those claims. The \ndefense has simply failed to carry that burden. All of plaintiffs' legal claims in the fourth \namended complaint should be permitted to go forward.

Case No. 04-C-0193 \nMILWAUKEE COUNTY, et al., \nDefendants. \nNOTICE OF PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \nPLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY IF YOU ARE: \n•  A MILWAUKEE COUNTY FAMILY CARE PARTICIPANT WHO LIVES IN \nAN ADULT FAMILY HOME (ALSO CALLED AN \"AFH\") OR A COMMUNITY \nBASED RESIDENTIAL FACILITY (ALSO CALLED A \"CBRF\") \n•  A PERSON IN MILWAUKEE COUNTY WITH DISABILITIES WHO IN THE \nFUTURE MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR FAMILY CARE AND TO LIVE IN \nAN AFH OR CBRF WITH FAMILY CARE FUNDING \n•  A FAMILY MEMBER, GUARDIAN, OR POWER OF ATTORNEY \nFOR ANY PERSON DESCRIBED ABOVE \nTHE MATTERS EXPLAINED IN TIDS NOTICE WILL NOT IMMEDIATELY INCREASE OR REDUCE \nBENEFITS RECEIVED BY ANY FAMILY CARE PARTICIPANT. \nALL FAMILY CARE PARTICIPANTS WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE NEEDED AND \nAPPROPRIATE SERVICES FOR WHICH THEY ARE ELIGIBLE. \nSEE SECTION ill, BELOW, FOR INSTRUCTIONS ABOUT WHOM YOU CAN CONTACT FOR MORE \nINFORMATION ABOUT THE MATTERS EXPLAINED IN TIDS NOTICE. \nI.  WHAT THIS NOTICE IS ABOUT. \nThis notice is about a lawsuit concerning certain rights of Milwaukee County residents with disabilities who \nare now or may in the future participate in the Family Care program.  Family Care is a program providing home and \ncommunity-based support services to persons with disabilities.  In Milwaukee County, Family Care is administered \nby the Milwaukee County Department on Aging (also called \"MCDA\") through its Care Management Organization \n(also called the \"CMO\").  The state Department of Health and Family Services (also called \"DHFS\") provides \nfunding for Family Care and oversees operation of Family Care by MCDA and the CMO. \nThis lawsuit was filed in 2004.  Judge Lynn S. Adelman, from the United States District Court for the \nEastern District of Milwaukee, is presiding over the lawsuit. \nEXHIBIT  B \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA  Filed 08/14/07  Page 18 of 32  Document 161 \n\nJudge Adelman certified the lawsuit as a \"class action.\"  This means that the lawsuit involves the rights of \nall persons in the \"class\" identified by Judge Adelman, even if those persons are not participating directly in the \nlawsuit.  The persons in  the  class are  called the  \"class members\" or the \"plaintiffs.\"  The class identified by \nJudge Adelman is: \nDisabled Milwaukee County residents who are now, or will in the future, be eligible to reside \nin a Family Care funded community-based residential facility (\"CBRF\") or adult family \nhome (\" AFH\"). \nIn the lawsuit, the plaintiffs claimed that their legal rights were violated because Milwaukee County and \nDHFS were not providing enough funding for Family Care members who lived or wished to live in a CBRF or a \nAFH. \nThe other side of the lawsuit, called the \"defendants,\" consists of Milwaukee County, DHFS, and DHFS \nSecretary Kevin Hayden.  The defendants deny that the plaintiffs' legal rights were violated as claimed in the \nlawsuit. \nThe lawyers for the class members and the defendants have negotiated a Settlement Agreement. This means \nthat the lawsuit will end without a trial or a decision by Judge Adelman about the claims made by the plaintiffs, if the \nsettlement is approved.  Instead, the lawyers for the class members and the defendants have agreed about certain \nactions that MCDA,  the  CMO,  and DHFS will  take  to  ensure that Family Care in Milwaukee County meets \napplicable requirements.  Some  information about the  Settlement Agreement is provided in Section V,  below. \nInformation about how  you  can obtain a copy of the  Settlement Agreement or further  information about the \nSettlement Agreement is provided in Section III, below. \nThe lawyers have asked Judge Adelman to approve the Settlement Agreement.  Further information about \nthis process is provided in Section II, below.

INFORMATION ABOUT THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT. \nIf Judge Adelman approves the Settlement Agreement, then MCDA, the CMO, and DHFS will commit to \ntake certain actions over a two-year period to help insure that Family Care in Milwaukee County meets applicable \nrequirements. \nThe most important parts of the Settlement Agreement are summarized below.  For further details, such as \napplicable  deadlines,  please  review  the  Settlement  Agreement  online  or  by  requesting  a  paper  copy  from \nAttorney Pledl as discussed in Section III above. \n(A)  Commitment~· of the Milwaukee County Department on Aging and the CMO \n1.  The CMO will provide annual training to care managers about when notices of intended adverse \naction must be sent to Family Care participants.  This information also will be incorporated into \nrelated training materials. \n2.  The CMO will make reasonable efforts to support the enactment of Governor Doyle's budget \nproposal to provide funding for an independent advocacy program for Family Care participants. \n3.  The CMO will expand its annual audit review process for CBRF providers to include actual salary \nand wages, staff turnover rates, occupancy, and further details regarding cost and wage structures. \n4.  The  CMO  will  review  audited fmancial  statements and  contracts  for  multifacility,  corporate \nproviders of 3-4 bed AFHs, including actual salary and wages, staff turnover rates, occupancy, and \nfurther details regarding cost and wage structures. \n5.  In connection with CBRF and AFH provider 2008 rate setting, the CMO will consider data from \nprovider surveys released in March 2007.  The CMO will retain its discretion to establish the \nrate-setting methodology and negotiate provider rates, subject to supervisory review by DHFS. \n6.  The CMO will complete provider network adequacy reviews twice a year, beginning with one \nreview in calendar year 2007.  These reviews will include needs assessments of future Family Care \nparticipants and where they are living in Milwaukee County.  The results of these reviews will be \nprovided to the development and/or land use planning departments of all Milwaukee County cities, \ntowns, and villages.  The CMO will retain its current right to terminate contracts with providers \nwhose costs are not competitive. \n7.  In connection with provider rate-setting for calendar years 2008 and 2009, MCDA will provide \nCBRF, AFH, and day services providers the factors taken into account in developing the rates \noffered those providers.  MCDA will post a summary of these factors on its website. \n8.  The CMO will start a formal process of soliciting input from CBRF, AFH, and day services \nproviders that will be considered to the extent that it is relevant in future rate setting. \n9.  At least once annually in calendar years 2007, 2008, and 2009, the CMO will invite all Milwaukee \nCounty  municipalities  to  provide  input  on  affordable  CBRF,  AFH,  and  other  housing  for \n4 \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA  Filed 08/14/07  Page 21  of 32  Document 161 \n\nMilwaukee County Family Care participants, and will encourage the development of such housing \nthroughout Milwaukee County. \n10.  The CMO will work with the MCDA Resource Center to provide all nursing homes located in \nMilwaukee County with informational materials about the alternate residential options available \nthrough the Family Care program, and will provide contact information for persons who wish to \ndiscuss other options available to them. \n(B)  Commitments of the Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services \n1.  DHFS will issue written guidance reiterating that a Family Care participant may contest the choice \nof the  residential  or day services provider proposed by the  CMO, through  the  Family Care \ngrievance procedures or a fair hearing.  The written guidance will  note  that  the  standard in \nresolving these disputes is whether the proposed plan would provide care, treatment, or supports \nthat are insufficient to meet the participant's needs or outcomes, or are provided in a setting that is \nunnecessarily restrictive or less integrated than is appropriate to the participant's needs.  It will \nstate the importance of following the notice procedures required by the Wisconsin Administrative \nCode and the Family Care contract.  DHFS will provide a draft of its written guidance to the \nplaintiffs' lawyers and certain public interest law firms,  and will accept comments from them \nbefore fmalizing the written guidance.  When complete, the written guidance will be posted on the \nDHFS website. \n2.  DHFS  will  develop  additional  informational  materials  explaining  the  Resource  Allocation \nDecision (\"RAD\") method used in the Family Care program to help participants identify personal \noutcomes, after which a participant's care management team then works with the participant and/or \nthe participant's authorized representatives to find the most cost-effective way of achieving those \npersonal outcomes via a service plan that is both reasonable and effective.  The materials will \ninclude an explanation that Family Care participants who enter CBRFs and AFHs are not and \nshould not be automatically disqualified from participating in day programming services outside \ntheir residences, and that it is appropriate to use the RAD to determine whether the outcomes of \nindividual Family Care participants who reside in CBRFs and AFHs can not be met without access \nto outside day programming services.  DHFS will provide a draft of its informational materials to \nthe plaintiffs' lawyers and certain public interest law firms, and will accept comments from them \nbefore fmalizing the informational materials.  When complete, the informational materials will be \nposted on the DHFS website.  The informational materials also will be provided to administrative \nlaw judges and other persons who review Family care grievances. \n3.  If the CMO's 2008 annual certification application to DHFS includes submission of any revised \nform notices, DHFS will provide copies of any revised form notices to the plaintiffs' lawyers and \ncertain public interest law firms, and will accept comments from them regarding the revised form \nnotices.  DHFS will retain sole discretion to determine whether or not to certify the CMO for 2008, \nand to determine whether to require the CMO to make any changes in the CMO's revised form \nnotices. \n4.  If the Family Care independent advocacy program included in Governor Doyle's 2007-09 budget \nproposal  is  established,  DHFS  will  require  the  independent  advocacy  program  to  provide \nsemi-annual statistical reports about referrals received by the  independent advocacy program. \nThese reports will be posted on the DHFS website. \n5.  DHFS and Secretary Hayden will continue to support Governor Doyle's budget proposal to create \nand fund an independent advocacy program for Family Care participants.  If funding is included in \nthe 2007-09 budget passed by the legislature, DHFS will take steps to implement the program \npromptly. \n5 \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA  Filed 08/14/07  Page 22 of 32  Document 161 \n\n6.  DHFS will work with the CMO to enhance openness of the provider rate-setting process for rate \nyears 2008 and 2009 by exploring alternate rate-setting methods for CBRF and AFH providers. \n7.  DHFS  will  issue  written  guidance  reiterating  the  importance  of appropriate  and  adequate \npre-transfer planning so as to identify and minimize potential effects on a Family Care participant \ntransferring from one residential setting to another.  DHFS will provide a draft of its written \nguidance to the plaintiffs' lawyers and certain public interest law firms, and will accept comments \nfrom them before finalizing the written guidance.  When complete, the written guidance will be \nposted on the DHFS website. \n8.  DHFS will assist MCDA and its existing Placement Team in implementing additional practices to \nenhance planning for safe and effective residential moves for Family Care participants, assess \nmoves  before  they  occur  to  identify  potential  harmful  effects  on participants,  and  develop \nstrategies for minimizing those effects. \n9.  DHFS will conduct a one-time review of Milwaukee County Watts review procedures and pursue \nany corrective  action as  determined appropriate by DHFS.  A  copy of the  fmal report,  any \ncorrective action plan, and corrective action compliance reports will be provided to plaintiffs' \ncounsel. \n10.  DHFS will direct its external quality review organization to include in the care plan review process \nconsideration of whether a particular Family Care participant would be more appropriately placed \nin a less restrictive/more integrated residence, and of whether the individual would prefer to move \nto a less restrictive/more integrated facility. \n(C)  Agreement Regarding Day Programming: The plaintiffs and defendants agree that Family Care \nparticipants who enter CBRFs and AFHs are not and should not automatically be disqualified from participating in \nday programming services outside their residences.  They further agree that it is appropriate to use the RAD to \ndetermine whether the outcomes of Family Care participants who reside in CBRFs and AFHs cannot be met without \naccess to outside day programming services. \n(D)  Enforcement:  If the parties disagree about whether the  defendants are  complying with the \nSettlement Agreement, the parties must first try to resolve the disagreement through negotiation with each other.  If \nnegotiations do not succeed, then the plaintiffs' lawyers may ask the Court to resolve the disagreement. \n(E)  Attorney Fees:  If successful, the kinds of claims that are involved in this lawsuit would entitle the \nplaintiffs to reasonable attorney fees and costs.  The parties have negotiated, separately from the remainder of the \nsettlement agreement, a compromise of the claim for attorneys' fees and costs submitted by the plaintiffs' lawyers. \nUnder the Settlement Agreement, plaintiffs' lawyers, who include lawyers from the Pledl Law Office, of Milwaukee, \nWisconsin, and the not-for-profit organization National Health Law Program, Inc. of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, \nwould receive a total of One Hundred and Thirty Thousand Dollars ($130,000.00) as compensation and to reimburse \ntheir expenses incurred during this 3 l/2-year-old lawsuit. \n6 \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA  Filed 08/14/07  Page 23 of 32  Document 161 \n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN \nJOAN BZDA WKA, et al., \nPlaintiffs, \nv.

R. Civ. P. 23(e), this Court must determine whether to give final\napproval to the proposed Settlement Agreement. The parties have agreed that this settlement is\nfair, adequate and reasonable and that, if given final approval by the Court, it will dispose of all\nclaims in this action. The rights of all class members were given due regard throughout the\nnegotiations. There is no evidence of any collusion or other improper behavior between the\nnegotiating parties. Accordingly, the plaintiffs request that the court give final approval to this\nsettlement agreement after considering any written objections and comments as well as those\npresented at thefairness hearingscheduledfor October19,2007.\nFACTUALBACKGROUND\nLitigationHistory\nThis lawsuit was filed on January 28, 2004, in Milwaukee County Circuit Court. (Case\nNo. 04-CF-0862). The County defendants removed the case to federal court on February 25,\n2004. [Eastern District Docket No. 1]. Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint against the\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Filed 09/26/2007     Page 2 of 14     Document 183 \nCounty on April 13, 2004. [Dkt 18]. A Second Amended Complaint adding the State defendants\nwas filed on April 30, 2004. [Dkt 23]. The Third Amended Complaint was filed on August 19,\n2004 [Dkt 37]; and the Fourth Amended Complaint was filed on March 30, 2005. [Dkt 51 &\nECF court order dated April 25, 2005]. The State and County defendants (“defendants”) filed\nmotions todismissthe FourthAmendedComplaintonJune15,2005.[Dkt68&70].\nOn February 7, 2006, the court entered an order partially granting and partially denying\nDefendants’ motions to dismiss and, on April 5, 2006, denied Defendants’ motion to certify the\ndenial of the motion to dismiss for interlocutory review. See Decision and Order on Motion to\nDismiss [Dkt 86]; Decision and Order Denying Certification for Interlocutory Appeal (Apr. 6,\n2006) [Dkt 106]. On October 13, 2006, the court certified a plaintiff class consisting of\nMilwaukee County residents with disabilities who are now, or will in the future, be eligible to\nreside in a Family Care-funded community-based residential facility (“CBRF”) or an adult\nfamilyhome(“AFH”). DecisionandOrderCertifyingClass[Dkt125].\nSettlementProcess\nThe case was referred to Magistrate Judge Patricia Gorence on December 4, 2006. [Dkt\n135]. Judge Gorence held telephone conferences on December 19 [Dkt 139] and December 21\n[Dkt140].There was a fulldayof negotiations on February26.[Dkt 150].There were follow-up\ntelephone conferences with Judge Gorence on March 27 [Dkt 151] and May 25. [Dkt 155].\nThroughout the time period from January to May of 2007, counsel had numerous telephone\nconferences and exchanged detailed written settlement proposals and responses. There was some\ndelay in getting final approval from the Milwaukee County Board and the parties filed a joint\nmotion for preliminary approval on August 14. [Dkt 160]. The Court granted preliminary\napprovaloftheclasssettlementonAugust21.[Dkt165].\n2\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Filed 09/26/2007     Page 3 of 14     Document 183 \nTheAugust21orderalso approved thejointproposalfornoticetothe knownmembers of\nthe class. Id. Plaintiffs mailed a copy of the Notice along with a complete copy of the proposed\nSettlementAgreementto communityagencieson September11.AffidavitofMailing[Dkt.166].\nState’sProposedFindingsofFact\nThe State has submitted detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law. They contain an\nextensive recitation of the discovery, motion and settlement phases of the case. (The plaintiffs\nappreciate the State’s substantial efforts in producing the findings and conclusions.) Not\nsurprisingly, plaintiffs characterize the strength of their own case somewhat differently from the\ndefendants, and this will be discussed below in the appropriate section. With this modification,\nplaintiffs accepttheState’sproposedfindings offactandconclusionsoflaw.\nTheInputandCommentProcess\nThe class Notice instructed the recipients to call Atty. Pledl with any questions. The\nnumber of calls from Family Care members, guardians and family members received each day\narelistedbydateasfollows:\nSeptember13 66\nSeptember14 42\nSeptember17 14\nSeptember18 9\nSeptember19 8\nSeptember20 3\nSeptember21 3\nSeptember24 7\nSeptember25 4\nSeptember26 1\nTOTAL 157\nApproximately 25 other people who called after hours and on the weekends apparently received\nsufficient information about the proposed Settlement from a voicemail greeting that provided\nanswers to the most frequent questions. These callers did not request a return call. A total of 10\n3\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Filed 09/26/2007     Page 4 of 14     Document 183 \ncallers (included in the daily totals above) requested a copy of the complete Settlement\nAgreement whichwas senttothembymail.\nMost of the callers requested more information about the lawsuit and whether it would\nhave any impact on their current services. Very few of the callers made any comment about the\nproposed Settlement. Some of the callers had concerns or complaints about the Family Care\nprogram that are outside the scope of this lawsuit. Atty. Pledl spoke with each of them about\ntheir specific concerns. He referred some to their Family Care case manager with suggestions\nabout how to obtain additional information or clarify their options for different types of care. He\nreferred a few to local no-cost advocacy agencies. The defendants have expressed their interest\nin getting additional information about any “non-lawsuit” complaints and concerns. Atty. Pledl\nwill provide a summary to DHFS and Milwaukee County after the fairness hearing so that they\nwillbeabletoutilizethisinformationforqualityassurancepurposes.\nFive calls were received from AFH/CBRF providers in response to the mailed Notice.1\nThe residential providers each complained about the method by which the Milwaukee County\nDepartment on Aging set their rates and said that they were unable to cover their expenses.\nThesecallers weresupportiveoftheSettlement.Theywereespeciallypleasedwiththeportionof\nthe Settlement that calls for MCDA to collect actual AFH/CBRF cost data and utilize that\ninformationinsettingproviderrates.\nA few additional calls were received from human service agencies in Milwaukee County.\nThey had already received a copy of the complete Settlement Agreement.

The\nguardians of the current name plaintiffs who are served by HIL approve of the settlement.

Four people have done so: Estelle Stewart [Dkt 168], Rinda McClendon [Dkt\n169], Jessie Larson [Dkt 170] and Bonnie Van Landingham [Dkt 171]. Ms. Stewart requested to\naddress the Court while the others did not. The specific concerns and how they pertain to the\nclasssettlementarediscussedinalatersectionof thebrief.\nARGUMENT\nThe Proposed Settlement Agreement was reached through arms-length negotiations, and is\nfundamentallyfair,reasonableandadequate.\nIn order to approve a settlement agreement in a class action, a court must ascertain that a\nsettlement is fair, reasonable, adequate and the product of arms-length negotiations. Great Neck\nCapital Appreciation Investment Partnership, L.L.P. v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, L.L.P., 212\nF.R.D. 400, 409 (E.D. Wis. 2006). Settlement of class action litigation is favored. Isby v. Bayh,\n75 F.3d 1191, 1196 (7th Cir. 1996). Courts in the Seventh Circuit have formulated the same\nessential class settlement criteria in different ways. Ultimately, district courts are to consider the\nfollowing factors: (1) the strength of the plaintiffs' case, balanced against the settlement offer;\n(2) the defendants’ ability to pay; (3) the stage of the proceedings and the amount of discovery\nthat has been completed; (4) the complexity, length and expense of continued litigation;\n(5) whether there was fraud or collusion in the settlement; (6) the amount of opposition to the\nsettlement from affected parties; and (7) the opinion of competent counsel. EEOC v. Hiram\nWalker & Sons, Inc., 768 F.2d 884, 889 (7th Cir. 1985); Great Neck Capital Appreciation, 212\n5\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Filed 09/26/2007     Page 6 of 14     Document 183 \nF.R.D.at 409; Mangone v. First USA Bank, 206 F.R.D. 222,224 (S.D. Ill. 2001), citingsee Isby,\n75 F.2d at 1199; and Hispanics United of DuPage County v. Village of Addison, 988 F.Supp.\n1130,1150(N.D. Ill.1997).\nThere is a presumption in favor of class action settlements. “The district court may not\ndeny approval of a consent decree unless it is unfair, unreasonable or inadequate.” Hiram\nWalker, supra. All of the above factors weigh heavilyin favor of approving this settlement as the\nfollowingdiscussionwillshow.\nA. Thestrengthof theplaintiffs’case,balancedagainstthesettlementoffer.\nThis first factor is the most important in the court’s consideration. Isby v. Bayh, 75 F.2d.\nat 1199; Hiram Walker, 768 F.2d at 889. This determination is a practical one and the court\n“should refrain fromresolvingthe merits of thecontroversyor makingaprecisedeterminationof\ntheparties’respectivelegalrights.” Id.(citations omitted).\nThe plaintiffs have already prevailed in a number of motions, including surviving a\nmotion to dismiss and winning certification of the plaintiff class. Plaintiffs do not agree with the\nnegatives characterizations in the State’s proposed findings of fact such as “[m]oreover, some\nclaims are sufficiently vague that they present difficult proof problems for the Plaintiffs.” [State\nPFOF, Para. 43]. Also, statements like the one concerning the plaintiffs’ failure to supply proof\nabout individuals who were forced into more restrictive setting seems to confuse the procedural\npostureof thecaseprior to settlement. [StatePFOF, Para. 42].Theevidenceofclient transfers is\nin the possession of the County and their contract agencies. Plaintiffs’ counsel chose to pursue\nsettlement instead of the extensive discovery that would be necessary on this issue. Nonetheless,\nplaintiffs do have some concerns about the legal issues in this case. The law concerningprogram\naccess and reasonable accommodation in public benefit programs is still developing and this\n6\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Filed 09/26/2007     Page 7 of 14     Document 183 \nalone presents a substantial risk. Given the state of the law in this area, it is virtually certain that\nthe losing side would take an appeal. There is never a guaranteed outcome in litigation, and the\nclassplaintiffshaveasignificantinterestineliminatinganyriskofloss.\nMoving from the legal to the factual aspects of this litigation, plaintiffs do face\nsubstantial challenges in proving their case. Counsel and their experts would have to conduct\nnumerous depositions and review a mountain of documents. Unfortunately, it is a growing and\nchanging mountain. Each year, the State revisits the capitation formulas that determine monthly\nper client payments to Milwaukee County. And each year, County Family Care staff evaluate\nand revise the provider rate structure after receiving the State rate information. Our experience\nhere shows that it would be nearly impossible to do the necessary discovery and then litigate\ndispositivemotions and/ortrythecasebeforeanotheryearlycycle changes thelandscape.\nAnyconcerns about whether theplaintiffs would prevail attheend ofthis litigation areto\nbe balanced against the benefits of the settlement. The proposed Settlement Agreement provides\nsignificant benefits to the current and future members of the plaintiff class. Consideration of this\nfactorclearlycalls forapprovaloftheproposedSettlement.\nB. Thedefendants’ability topay.\nThis criterion involves a series of interlocking questions. On the one hand, both DHFS\nand Milwaukee County probably have the ability to fund whatever changes in the Family Care\nprogram that the Court might order. This means that ability-to-pay is not a constraint like a\ncorporation’simpendingbankruptcyor thelimitsofaliabilityinsurancepolicy.\nHowever, one way for a public entity to pay for any court-ordered program changes is to\nredirect funds from another part of the same program or from another State or County program\nthat also serves the class members. This could result in a zero sum (or worse) outcome for class\n7\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Filed 09/26/2007     Page 8 of 14     Document 183 \nmembers. Plaintiffs and defendants in many class action cases will not have any dealings with\neach other after the settlement. Here we have the opposite situation because most class members\nwill remain in the Family Care program for the remainder of their lives. They will benefit if the\nprogram is financially healthy. Other things being equal, the class members and the defendants\nhaveasimilarinterestinresolvingthecasein acost-effectiveway.\nC. Thestageof theproceedingsandtheamountof discoveryalreadytaken.\nThere has already been extensive document discovery by all sides. The State’s Proposed\nFindings provide a good summary of the documents discovery efforts. [State PFOF, Para. 56 –\n59]. In addition, plaintiffs’ counsel and the experts have been able to access a great of additional\ninformationfromtheDHFSwebsite.\nPlaintiffs’ counsel spoke with numerous Family Care residential and other service\nproviders to obtain information about program and financial issues. In addition, plaintiffs’\naccounting expert conducted two on-site reviews of residential provider financial records at the\nMCDA offices. Thus, counsel’s evaluation of the case was based upon significant information\nabout the facts of the case. See Great Neck Capital, 212 F.R.D. at 410; EEOC v. Hiram Walker,\n768 F.2dat891.\nD. Thecomplexity,lengthandexpenseofcontinuedlitigation.\nThis is a very significant factor in this case. The amount of time that the parties have\nalreadyspent on discovery and litigatinglegal issues is a fraction of the time that would be spent\npreparing the case for trial. There would be extensive depositions of State and County\nadministrators, yet more document review and coordination of experts who would review\ndiscovery documents and additional sources of information. The time and money saved by both\nsidesareasignificantincentivetosettle. GreatNeckCapital,212 F.R.D.at409.\n8\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Filed 09/26/2007     Page 9 of 14     Document 183 \nE. Thepresenceoffraudorcollusion.\nThe negotiations in this case were extensive and conducted at arm’s length. Plaintiffs’\ncounsel consulted with advocates for people with disabilities and the elderly in formulating a\nsubstantial list of demands. The parties participated in mediation overseen by Magistrate Judge\nGorence over the course of several months. Negotiations were intense and motivated by a desire\ntoreach asettlementthat wouldbenefitplaintiffs andtheentire FamilyCareprogram.\nThe parties did agree to an award of attorney’s fees. The negotiations for fees, however,\nwere completely separate from and independent of the negotiations on the merits. Moreover,\nplaintiffs’ counsel ultimately accepted payment for only about one-half of the hours actually\nexpended on this case in the interest of reaching settlement. This is being paid by the defendants\nand does not reduce or impact the outcome for the class in any way. There is no evidence of\ncollusionorotherimpropermotive.\nF. Theamountof oppositiontothesettlement fromaffectedparties.\nMany Family Care members and others called plaintiffs’ counsel to complain about\nvarious aspects of the program.2 However, virtually all of the complaints relate to issues that\nwere not a part of the case or the proposed Settlement and no one actually opposed the\nsettlement. Fourindividuals filedcommentswiththeCourtandtheywillbediscussedindetail.\nEstellaM.Stewart\nMs. Stewart filed her comment on September 24. [Dkt 168]. Atty. Pledl spoke with her\nby telephone on September 26. Ms. Stewart’s concerns fall into two categories. Ms. Stewart\n2 It is unfortunate that there were any complaints at all, but plaintiffs’ counsel do not mean to draw any\nconclusions here about the type of complaints or the number of complaints in comparison to the total\nMilwaukee CountyFamilyCare membership. Counsel will be providing a summaryof the complaints to\nthe defendants so that the information maybe used for program evaluation or improvement. Manyof the\ncallers were satisfied with the services they receive through Family Care and the purpose of their calls\nwassolelytoseekadditionalinformationaboutthelegalcase.\n9\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Filed 09/26/2007     Page 10 of 14     Document 183 \nobjects to the requirement that all long-term care services for people over 60 in Milwaukee\nCounty must be delivered through the Family Care system. She would prefer to receive those\nservices through Medicaid. This is a fundamental question in Medicaid managed care systems\nlike Family Care. The Medicaid waiver agreement between the State of Wisconsin and the\nFederal Government that established Family Care requires that all of the previous community-\ncare waiver programs to be rolled into the new managed care system. People cannot choose to\nreceive long-term care services under the old system. Allowing that would have a huge effect on\nthe viability of the system. Taking this position amounts to opposing the entire Family Care\nsystem. Ms. Stewart has asked to address the Court on this issue and her point of view may\ndeserve some exploration. However, plaintiffs’ counsel and their consultants felt very strongly\nthat the best approach was to pursue improvements to the entire Family Care system rather than\nallowing individuals to dis-enroll and still receive waiver services. That is what was achieved in\ntheproposedSettlement.\nMs. Stewarts’s other concerns involve her interaction with case managers and nurses\nemployed by Family Care contract agencies in Milwaukee County. She has worked with three\ndifferent agencies over the years and says that she has had problems with each revolving around\nrequests for specific services and a lack of responsiveness by the agencies and their staff. While\nthis case is focused more on AFH/CBRF residential services rather than services provided in the\nclient’s own home like Ms. Stewart’s situation, the proposed Settlement Agreement is intended\nto address concerns of this type. For example, Section II-D of the Agreement describes changes\nin the Resource Allocation Decision process. Improving the RAD process and particularly\nproviding additional information about the process to consumers and agencies should alleviate\nmany situations such as those Ms. Stewart’s. Also, she and others in her situation could receive\n10\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Filed 09/26/2007     Page 11 of 14     Document 183 \nassistance from the Individual Advocacy Program described in Section I-B and II-M of the\nSettlement inanydisputeswith FamilyCareagencies.\nRindaMcClendon\nMs. McClendon’s comment was received by the Court on September 24. [Dkt 169]. She\nis concerned about the financial eligibility reports for her husband that are prepared by\nMilwaukee County. This appears to be a situation where they have some financial resources and\nso they are expected to pay a “cost share” each month to cover part of the husband’s care.\nConcernsabouthowthecostshareiscomputed andthenexplainedtoclientssurfaced throughout\nthe litigation. Many of the callers complained about this issue and it comes up at almost any\nmeeting about Family Care. Plaintiffs’ counsel considered raising the cost share issue, but\ndetermined that it would have very little impact on the individuals with more significant\ndisabilities who live in AFH’s and CBRF’s. Most have SSI payments as their only income and\nno savings or other financial assets. Cost-share is not an issue for those who only receive\nmonthly SSI payments. The more general question raised by Ms. McClendon is responsiveness\nand, once again, the Independent Advocacy Program would be helpful to her. She has not\nrequestedtoaddress theCourt.\nJessieLarson\nMs. Larson’s comment was filed on September 25. [Dkt 170]. She is writing about her\nmother, Edna Craven, who lives in an “assisted living facility.” This could be an AFH or CBRF.\nMs. Larson says that her family was not given proper information about room and board costs\nand they found (apparently while looking for an appropriate residential facility) that “many of\ntheroomandboard rates arehigherthantheaveragesocialsecuritybenefits.” Id.\n11\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Filed 09/26/2007     Page 12 of 14     Document 183 \nA basic principle of the Federal-State waiver programs (including Family Care) is that a\nperson’sown moneyorSocial Security/SSIcheckmustbeused topayfortheirhousingandfood\nin an AFHorCBRF. Federalwaiverfunding maybeused topayfordisability-related services in\nthe residential facility, but not the building itself. Many AFH/CBRF residents receive only SSI\npayments and many others receive only Social Security. The cost of housing is the major\ndeterminant of room and board costs and many residential facilities in Milwaukee County have\nR&B rates that exceed what most people can afford. This is one dimension of the financial\nproblems facing residential providers. Some have emptybeds because their R&B rate is too high\nto attract residents. Others set theirR&B rates lowerthan theiractualreal estatecost.Eitherway,\nR&B rateshaveasignificantnegativeeffectonthefinancial conditionofresidentialproviders.\nNumerous items in the County’s portion of the Settlement Agreement address the\nfinancial condition of residential providers. [Section I-C through I-N]. The Milwaukee County\nDepartment on Aging will be collecting detailed cost data from AFH and CBRF providers.\nMCDA will then use that data to set 2008 provider rates, although it retains the discretion to set\nand negotiate provider rates. [Sec. I-G]. It will also publicize the factors it uses in developing\nprovider rates. [Sec. I-I & J]. All of these provisions will improve the process of setting provider\nrates by making it more objective and transparent.

      "text": "Case 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Filed 09/26/2007     Page 1 of 11     Document 180 \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nEASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n \nJOAN BZDAWKA, et al., \n       \nPlaintiffs, \n \n    v.              Case No. 04-C-1093 \n \n \nMILWAUKEE COUNTY, et al., \n       \n      Defendants. \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n \nMEMORANDUM OF MILWAUKEE COUNTY \nIN SUPPORT OF PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n \n \n   \nUnder Rule 23(e)(1), F.R.C.P., the court must approve any settlement of a class \naction.   Before approving a settlement, the court must be satisfied that notice of the \nproposed settlement has been directed to class members in a reasonable manner, and that \nthe proposed settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.  Milwaukee County respectfully \nsubmits this memorandum in support of the proposition that the procedural and \nsubstantive requirements for approval of the proposed settlement are satisfied.  In \naddition to the arguments presented in this memorandum, Milwaukee County joins in the \nfacts1 and arguments submitted by counsel for the other parties to support approval of the \nproposed settlement. \n \n                                                 \n1 Defendant Milwaukee County concurs in the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law which have \nbeen drafted and filed on behalf of the State of Wisconsin defendants and joins those defendants in \nrespectfully urging the court to adopt those findings and conclusions as its own.   \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Filed 09/26/2007     Page 2 of 11     Document 180 \nI.  Notice has been directed to class members in a reasonable manner. \nThe procedure by which notice of the proposed settlement was directed to class \nmembers, which process the court has already approved, is described in detail in \nparagraphs 36 through 40 the State of Wisconsin defendants’ proposed findings of fact \nand documented in the supporting affidavits referenced therein.   \nIn order to comply with Rule 23, and as a matter of constitutional due process, \nnotice of a proposed settlement or compromise of a class action should be directed to \nclass members in the best manner which is practicable under the circumstances, \nincluding, in some cases, individual notice to all class members who can be identified \nthrough reasonable effort, DeJulius v. New England Health Care Employees Pension, \n429 F.3d 935, 943-944 (10th Cir.).   \nThe procedure for distribution of the notice in this case certainly meets, and \nprobably exceeds, the minimum standards under Rule 23 and the applicable case law.  \nIndividual notice was mailed to all class members who could be identified through \nreasonable effort: All current Family Care members, which includes all current class \nmembers (those currently residing in CBRF’s or adult family homes) and some future \nclass members (current Family Care members who do not currently reside in CBRF’s or \nadult family homes but who may in the future be appropriate for such residential \nfacilities).  In addition, to assure effective notice to class members and future class \nmembers who are, to the knowledge of the defendants, under a disability which could \naffect their ability to understand the notice, individual notice was mailed to the guardians \nand agents operating under activated powers of attorney for current Family Care \nmembers.   \n  2\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Filed 09/26/2007     Page 3 of 11     Document 180 \nFinally, the notice was posted on the DHFS web site, and it was distributed to a \nwide variety of agencies and community organizations which provide services to and/or \nadvocate on behalf of persons who are or may in the future be members of the plaintiff \nclass.   \nIn short, every reasonable effort was made to afford effective notice of the \nproposed settlement to the class members and to others in the community, particularly to \nthose who are best positioned to understand the implications of the proposed settlement \nand to speak on behalf of the class members. \nII  The proposed settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate. \n  In order to approve the proposed settlement, the court must determine that the \nsettlement is fair, adequate and reasonable.  Factors to be considered by the court in \nmaking that determination include: (a) the likelihood of success on the merits weighed \nagainst the amount and form of the relief offered in the settlement; (b) the risks, expense, \nand delay of further litigation; (c) the judgment of experienced counsel who have \ncompetently evaluated the strength of their proofs; (d) the amount of discovery completed \nand the character of the evidence uncovered; (e) whether the settlement is fair to the \nunnamed class members; (f) objections raised by class members; (g) whether the \nsettlement is the product of arm's length negotiations as opposed to collusive bargaining; \nand (h) whether the settlement is consistent with the public interest. See, Granada Invs., \nInc. v. DWG Corp., 962 F.2d 1203, 1205 (6th Cir.1992); Williams v. Vukovich, 720 F.2d \n909, 922-23 (6th Cir.1983); Kogan v. AIMCO Fox Chase, L.P., 193 F.R.D. 496, 501-02 \n(E.D.Mich.2000); Steiner v. Fruehauf Corp., 121 F.R.D. 304, 305-06 (E.D.Mich.1988). \n  3\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Filed 09/26/2007     Page 4 of 11     Document 180 \n  (a)    The likelihood of success on the merits weighed against the amount \nand form of the relief offered in the settlement.   \nBecause this case does not involve monetary damage claims, the court cannot \napply this factor in the typical arithmetical fashion, evaluating the settlement as \npercentage of the plaintiffs’ maximum recovery and comparing the result with the \nplaintiffs’ statistical odds of success, see, In re Cardizem CD Antitrust Litigation, 218 \nF.R.D. 508 E.D. Mich. 203).   Nevertheless, this factor militates in favor of approval of \nthe proposed settlement in this case. \nThe proposed findings of fact submitted by the State of Wisconsin defendants \ninclude a description of the plaintiffs’ claims as they have evolved through the history of \nthis action.  That description is as clear and precise as the nature of those claims will \nallow.  Under the court’s prior decisions, some of the plaintiffs’ claims have survived \ndismissal motions as abstract legal propositions.  Nevertheless, it is fair to state that the \nplaintiffs would experience difficulty in proving facts sufficient to withstand summary \njudgment motions or to support those claims at trial.    \nThe crux of the plaintiffs claims against Milwaukee County is that the County is \nnot paying CBRF operators enough to guarantee Family Care members a stable network \nof providers sufficient to meet their needs and avoid the deleterious consequences of \ntransfer from one provider to another or, even worse, transfer to a “less integrated” \nresidential setting.   The plaintiffs identify a few providers who complain, unsurprisingly, \nthat their businesses are insufficiently profitable at the rates they have negotiated with the \nCounty.  Also, plaintiffs’ experts have offered guarded preliminary opinions, based on a \nreview of financial statements submitted to Milwaukee County, that some smaller \n  4\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Filed 09/26/2007     Page 5 of 11     Document 180 \nresidential providers were experiencing financial distress (see, e.g., R. 120).   However, \nthus far the plaintiffs have been unable to identify any members of plaintiff class for \nwhom the threatened harms postulated in their complaint have actually come to pass.  \nMoreover, the County’s actual experience has been that CBRF operators and other \nresidential providers are not leaving the Family Care program due to inadequate \nreimbursement rates, and that there is no shortage of new residential providers who want \nto become part of the program, see, Aff. of James Hennen, submitted in support of State \nDefendants’ Opposing Motions for Class Certification (R-115).   Therefore, there is at \nleast a reasonable basis to doubt that the plaintiffs can prove the essential factual premise \nfor their claims against Milwaukee County.   The same may be said for the plaintiffs’ \nclaims against the State of Wisconsin defendants, for the reasons explained in their \nsubmissions. \nEspecially when weighed against the plaintiffs’ likelihood of succeeding on the \nmerits in this action, the commitments of Milwaukee County which are part of the \nproposed settlement will provide significant benefits to the plaintiff class.  They \neffectively address the plaintiffs’ concerns about the availability of appropriate residential \nservices by addressing the legitimate concerns of the CBRF and adult family home \noperators who provide those services with respect to the rate-setting process.  Milwaukee \nCounty has agreed to substantial refinements to the process by which reimbursement \nrates for Family Care residential providers are set.  Those refinements, which require \nMilwaukee County to solicit and utilize a broader range of information about the \nproviders’ true costs to provide services to Family Care members, will make the rate-\nsetting process more transparent and equitable for the providers while preserving the \n  5\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Filed 09/26/2007     Page 6 of 11     Document 180 \nability of Milwaukee County to administer Family Care on a cost-efficient managed care \nmodel, which is critical to the survival of the program.      \n(b)    The risks, expense and delay of further litigation. \nFrom the perspective of members of the plaintiff class, the primary risk of further \nlitigation is that, for the reasons discussed above as well as the reasons documented in the \nproposed findings of fact and conclusions of law submitted by the State of Wisconsin \ndefendants, ultimately they will be unable to prove the facts necessary to support their \nremaining claims.   Those claims could be dismissed on summary judgment or at trial, in \nwhich case this lawsuit will avail them naught.  The proposed settlement avoids that risk \nby providing immediate and significant improvements in the administration of the Family \nCare program.  \nAlso, continued prosecution of this action through trial (and, in all likelihood, \nappeal) would cause significant additional cost and delay.  Although substantial \ndiscovery, primarily in the form of document production and interrogatories, has already \noccurred, considerable additional time and effort would be required to complete \ndiscovery from both fact and expert witnesses, prepare and brief dispositive motions, and \nprepare for trial.   \nBesides occupying counsel, those activities would consume an enormous amount \nof the time and attention of administrators and other personnel of both the Wisconsin \nDepartment of Health and Family Services and the Milwaukee County Department on \nAging for discovery, trial preparation and other litigation-related tasks.  The resources of \nboth those agencies are not unlimited.  The interests of the plaintiff class will be better \nserved if those resources are devoted to improving the administration of the Family Care \n  6\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Filed 09/26/2007     Page 7 of 11     Document 180 \nprogram (including, but not limited to, implementing the terms of the proposed settlement \nagreement) and providing services to its members, rather than to additional depositions, \ndocument discovery and the like. \n(c)  The judgment of experienced counsel who have competently evaluated \nthe strength of their proofs. \nCounsel for the plaintiffs can certainly speak for themselves with regard to this \nfactor.  However, defendant Milwaukee County is satisfied that plaintiffs’ local counsel, \nMr. Pledl, has extensive experience in litigating the rights of persons with disabilities in \nactions against state and municipal agencies.  The court can reasonably trust his judgment \nin evaluating the strength of his clients’ case and negotiating a settlement based on that \nevaluation.  In this case, the reliability of that judgment is reinforced by his decision to \nobtain the assistance of the National Health Law Program, Inc., a national public interest \nlaw firm which specializes in services to, among other groups, the elderly and people \nwith disabilities, and the concurrence of that firm in the proposed settlement agreement. \nIn class actions of a commercial nature arising under anti-trust and consumer \nprotection laws, courts have adverted to the participation of attorneys general as factor in \nfavor of the fairness and adequacy of a settlement, New York v. Reebok Int’l, Ltd., 96 \nF.3d 44, 48 (2d Cir. 1996).  In those cases the attorney general participates on the \nplaintiffs’ side in a  parens patriae capacity rather than, as in this case, representing \ndefendants.  Even in this case, however, the participation of the attorney weighs in favor \nof the conclusion that the proposed settlement is fair, adequate and reasonable.  Certainly \nthe attorney general and, for that matter, the Milwaukee County corporation counsel, \nhave considerable experience in defending cases involving both medical assistance and \n  7\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Filed 09/26/2007     Page 8 of 11     Document 180 \nother entitlement programs and federal disability law.   Both those offices have the \nexperience and sophistication required to competently assess the merits of such a case \nand to reach a reasonable judgment that a stipulated resolution is reasonable and prudent. \n(d)  The amount of discovery completed and the character of the evidence \nuncovered. \nThe amount of discovery completed and the character of the evidence uncovered \nin this action is sufficient to allow counsel for the parties to make a competent assessment \nof the strengths and weaknesses of their respective claims and defenses.  \nAlthough substantial additional discovery would be necessary to prepare for \nsummary judgment motions and for trial if this case was not settled, the amount of \ndiscovery completed to date is not inconsiderable.  As noted in the State of Wisconsin \ndefendants’ proposed findings of fact, thousands of pages of documents have been \nexchanged.   \nIn addition, experts retained by plaintiffs’ counsel availed themselves of the \nopportunity to review the files maintained by Milwaukee County for each CBRF operator \nunder contract to provide services of Family Care members.  Those experts reviewed and \nanalyzed the financial statements submitted by those operators.   By that means they were \nable to assess the viability of plaintiffs’ claims against Milwaukee County to the extent \nthat those claims depended upon the assertion that Milwaukee County’s reimbursement \nrates for residential providers were so inadequate as to violate the rights of Family Care \nmembers under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.   \n(e)  Whether the settlement is fair to the unnamed class members; \n  8\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Filed 09/26/2007     Page 9 of 11     Document 180 \nThe relief provided under the proposed settlement agreement will redound equally \nto the benefit of all current and future Family Care members who are receiving or will \nreceive residential services in a CBRF or adult family home.  It does not provide any \nbenefits to the named plaintiffs exclusively.  Therefore, fairness to the unnamed class \nmembers relative to the named plaintiffs is not an issue. \n(f)  Objections raised by class members. \nThis factor poses no impediment to approval of the proposed settlement \nagreement because thus far no cogent objections have been raised.    \nEach Family Care member, and each person operating as an agent of a member \nunder an order for guardianship or an activated power of attorney, received individual \nmail notice of the proposed settlement agreement.  As of the date of this writing, we are \naware of only three responses from class members or their agents in response to the \nnotice of proposed settlement (R. 168, 169 and 170).   While those responses express \nsome dissatisfaction with various aspects of the administration of the Family Care \nprogram, their complaints are not directly related to the substantive provisions of the \nproposed settlement agreement or to the claims raised on behalf of the plaintiff class in \nthis lawsuit.    \n(g)  Whether the settlement is the product of arm’s length negotiations as \nopposed to collusive bargaining. \nThe process of mediation and negotiation that led to the proposed settlement \nagreement in this action is described in detail in the proposed findings of fact submitted \nby the State of Wisconsin Defendants.  The nature of the settlement process in this case \nas described in those proposed findings, particularly the highly structured mediation \n  9\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Filed 09/26/2007     Page 10 of 11     Document 180 \nprocedure which was directed and supervised by Magistrate Judge Gorence, clearly \nshows genuine arm’s length bargaining and effectively precludes the possibility of \ncollusion. \nWith specific regard to the role of Milwaukee County as a party defendant in this \naction, the fact that the proposed settlement was subject to review and approval by the \nHealth and Human Needs Committee of the Milwaukee County Board of Supervisors and \nby the full Board of Supervisors after the conclusion of the negotiations among counsel \nparties provides additional assurance that the proposed agreement was the product of \ngenuine negotiation and compromise among the parties. \nFinally, as documented in the proposed findings of fact, the parties were careful to \nseparate the negotiation of the substantive terms of the settlement agreement from \nnegotiation of the plaintiffs’ attorney fees, which were not discussed until agreement had \nbeen reached on the substantive terms of the agreement.   \n(h)  Whether the settlement is consistent with the public interest. \nFrom the perspective of Milwaukee County, and doubtless of the other parties as \nwell, the predominant interest at stake in the settlement of this action is enhancing the \nability of the Family Care program to serve all program members in a fashion which \nmeets their various needs and conforms to all applicable laws while preserving the fiscal \nviability of the program.   The proposed settlement agreement is reasonably calculated to \nserve that interest and that interest only.  Therefore, it is manifestly consistent with the \npublic interest.  \n \n \n  10\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Filed 09/26/2007     Page 11 of 11     Document 180 \n \nCONCLUSION \n  For reasons set forth in this memorandum, together with those set forth in the \nsubmissions of the other parties, the proposed settlement agreement in this action is fair, \nadequate and reasonable and it is consistent with the public interest.  Milwaukee County \nrespectfully asks the court to approve that settlement agreement. \n    OFFICE OF CORPORATION COUNSEL \n \nBy:       /s/ John Jorgensen________________ \nJohn Jorgensen \nPrincipal Assistant Corporation Counsel \nState Bar No. 01017484 \nAttorneys for Defendant Milwaukee County \n \nP.O.

Case No. 04-C-193\nMILWAUKEE COUNTY, WISCONSIN DEPARTMENT\nOF HEALTH AND FAMILY SERVICES, and \nHELENE NELSON, in her official capacity\nas Secretary of DHFS,\nDefendants.\nDECISION AND ORDER\nI.  BACKGROUND\nPlaintiffs Joan Bzdawka, Sandra Ehrlichman and Marilyn Berdikoff are elderly disabled\nresidents of Milwaukee County with low incomes who are enrolled in Family Care, a Medicaid\nwaiver program administered by defendants.  Plaintiffs live in adult family homes (“AFHs”) or\ncommunity based residential facilities (CBRFs”) operated by Homes for Independent Living\n(“HIL”) which, pursuant to a contract with Milwaukee County, provides services to Family Care\nenrollees.  Plaintiffs claim that defendants are violating the Americans with Disabilities Act\n(“ADA”) and the Rehabilitation Act (“RA”) by inadequately compensating HIL and other\nproviders of services to Family Care enrollees in Milwaukee County, and that defendants’\nconduct might force them out of their homes.  Plaintiffs allege that in 2004, HIL notified\ndefendants that, because of the inadequate compensation, it intended to withdraw from\nFamily Care, and as a result Milwaukee County notified plaintiffs that it would transfer them\n1 I have amended the caption to reflect that some of the original plaintiffs are no longer\nparticipating in the case.\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 10/13/06   Page 1 of 10   Document 125 \n\nto other facilities.  Plaintiffs then commenced the present putative class action seeking\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief.  Defendants agreed not to move plaintiffs pending resolution\nof the case.  Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, and I granted the motion in part and\ndenied it in part.  Plaintiffs now ask me to certify a class consisting of disabled Milwaukee\nCounty residents who are now or will in the future be eligible to reside in a Family Care AFH\nor CBRF.  The state defendants oppose class certification.2\nII.  DISCUSSION\nIn order to obtain class certification, a plaintiff must satisfy several requirements.  First,\nas in any federal lawsuit, as a threshold issue, a plaintiff in a putative class action must\nestablish that she, as an individual, has standing to sue.3  Rozema v. Marshfield Clinic, 174\nF.R.D. 425, 432 (W.D. Wis. 1997).  If the plaintiff establishes individual standing, she may\nbring a class action if she can satisfy the criteria in Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.  Rule 23(a) has four\nprerequisites: (1) numerosity of parties; (2) commonality of legal and factual issues; (3)\ntypicality of the class representative’s claims; and (4) adequacy of representation.  If the\nplaintiff satisfies these requirements, she must also meet one of the requirements of Rule\n23(b).  In addition, although Rule 23 is silent on the matter, it implicitly requires that the\nplaintiff establish the existence of a definable class.  Rosario v. Livaditis, 963 F.2d 1013, 1017\n2The county defendant did not respond to plaintiffs’ motion.\n3Since the Supreme Court stated in Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U.S. 815, 831\n(1999), that “the class certification issues are . . . logically antecedent to Article III concerns,\nand themselves pertain to statutory standing, which may properly be treated before Article III\nstanding,” some courts have declined to consider challenges to a plaintiff’s standing before\naddressing class certification.  However, close analysis of Ortiz strongly suggests that its\n“‘logically antecedent’ language was not intended to create a new rule, but . . . restated pre-\nexisting doctrine . . .”  Linda S. Mullenix, Standing & Other Dispositive Motions After Amchem\nand Ortiz: The Problem of “Logically Antecedent” Inquiries, 2004 Mich. St. L. Rev. 703, 730-\n731.  Thus, I conclude that “courts should continue to review standing challenges, and other\ntraditional pre-certification dispositive motions, at the same time and in the same fashion as\n[they] did prior to . . . Ortiz.”  Id.\n-2-\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 10/13/06   Page 2 of 10   Document 125 \n\n(7th Cir. 1992).4  In the present case, defendants argue that plaintiffs fail to satisfy the\nstanding requirement and the requirements of Rule 23.\nA. Standing\nThe standing requirement has both a constitutional and prudential function.  Its\nconstitutional function ensures that the case or controversy requirement of Article III, section\n2 of the Constitution is satisfied.  If a plaintiff lacks the necessary interest in the lawsuit to\nhave standing, there is no case or controversy and the court lacks jurisdiction.  Simon v. E.\nKy. Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 37-38 (1976).  To satisfy the Article III standing\nrequirement, a plaintiff must allege: (1) injury in fact, meaning an invasion of a legally\nprotected interest that is concrete and particularized, actual or imminent, and not conjectural\nor hypothetical; (2) a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of,\nsuch that the injury is fairly traceable to the defendant’s actions; and (3) that a favorable\ndecision is likely to redress the injury.  Tobin for Governor v. Ill. State Bd. of Elections, 268\nF.3d 517, 527 (7th Cir. 2001).  The prudential function of the standing requirement enables\na court to exercise some discretion in determining whether a claim is appropriate for judicial\nresolution.  See Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Am. United for Separation of Church & State,\n454 U.S. 464, 474-75 (1982) (discussing prudential considerations).  “When a court refuses\n4Although courts have sometimes said that Rule 23 also implicitly requires that a\nplaintiff establish that she is a member of the class, it is now settled that Rule 23 does not\ncontain any separate membership in the class requirement.  Alba Conte and Herbert\nNewberg, Newberg on Class Actions § 2:10 (4th ed. 2002).  “Once standing to raise an issue\ncommon to a class has been established by the plaintiff, any supposed test of membership\nin the class is automatically satisfied, and whether the plaintiff should be permitted to maintain\na class action and whether in fact the issues are common to a class depend on the\napplication of Rule 23 criteria.”  Id.; see also Arkansas Ed. Ass’n. v. Board of Ed. of Portland,\nArk. School Dist., 446 F.2d 763, 766 (8th Cir. 1971) (stating that if a class representative has\nstanding to sue and is a real party in interest under Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(a), it need not meet any\nfurther requirement of class membership).\n-3-\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 10/13/06   Page 3 of 10   Document 125 \n\nto find prudential standing, it, in effect, refuses to infer a cause of action from common or\nstatutory law.”  William J. Fletcher, The Structure of Standing, 98 Yale L. J. 221, 252 (1988).\nI previously determined that plaintiffs had established standing in the constitutional\nsense.  I concluded that plaintiffs had alleged a real and immediate threat of injury, namely,\nbeing transferred out of their homes, that such threat was traceable to defendants’ alleged\ninadequate compensation of Family Care providers, and that the relief sought (a declaration\nthat such compensation was unlawful and an injunction against its continuation) would\nredress the claimed injury.  Defendants do not ask me to revisit that determination.  Rather,\nthey argue that in addition to establishing that plaintiffs have standing as individuals, plaintiffs\nmust establish that members of the putative class have standing and they have not done so.\nI disagree with defendants’ contention that class action plaintiffs must establish that\nunnamed class members have standing.  In a class action, the unnamed class members are\n“passive” in contrast to the named plaintiff, who actively prosecutes the litigation on their\nbehalf.  Conte & Newberg, supra, at § 2.7 (citing American Pipe & Const. Co. v. Utah, 414\nU.S. 538, 550-51 (1974)).  And while standing analysis is concerned with whether the named\nplaintiff is properly before the court, the represented class members are not only passive but\nalso not before the court.  Id.; see also F. & H.R. Farman-Farmaian Consulting Eng’rs Firm\nv. Harza Eng’g Co., 882 F.2d 281, 284 (7th Cir. 1989) (stating that in a class action the\nrelevant citizenship for diversity purposes is that of the named plaintiff rather than that of the\npersons on whose behalf he is suing).  Moreover, to require a plaintiff to show that every class\nmember’s  claim  presents  an  actual  controversy  would  place  a  formidable,  if  not\ninsurmountable, threshold burden on the parties and the court.  Since by definition the joinder\nof class members is impracticable, to require proof of the existence of individualized “cases”\n-4-\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 10/13/06   Page 4 of 10   Document 125 \n\nwould in essence be treating the class members as parties.  Mary Kay Kane, Standing,\nMootness & Federal Rule 23 – Balancing Perspectives, 26 Buffalo L. Rev. 83, 96 (1976-77).\nIn a class action, the appropriate question with respect to unnamed class members is\nnot whether they have standing to sue but whether the named plaintiff may assert their rights.\nAlthough this question implicates the prudential function of the standing requirement, it finds\nlegislative expression in the requirements of Rule 23 and is therefore a Rule 23 question,\nrather than one of standing.5  Thus, a federal court addressing a request for class certification\nshould not ask whether absent class members have standing but whether, in light of the\npolicies and requirements of Rule 23, it should authorize the plaintiff to represent the class\nmembers.  Kane, supra, at 97; see also Fallick v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 162 F.3d 410,\n422-23 (6th Cir. 1998) (stating that once the class representative has established individual\nstanding, whether he will be able to represent the putative class depends solely on whether\nhe can satisfy the Rule 23 criteria and that no additional standing requirement exists);\nHassine v. Jeffes, 846 F.2d 169, 175 (3rd Cir. 1988) (noting the district court’s erroneous use\nof the term “standing”); Rozema, 174 F.R.D. at 444 (stating that although a court should not\ncertify a class unless claims of class representative are typical of those of the class, a court\nshould not conduct a separate inquiry into whether individual members of the class have\nstanding); Coleman v. Cannon Oil Co., 141 F.R.D. 516, 522-24 (M.D. Ala. 1992) (rejecting an\nargument that in determining whether to certify a class a court should inquire whether\nmembers of plaintiff class have standing).\nDefendants cite several cases in support of their argument that unnamed class\nmembers must have standing.  However, the cases they cite do not persuade, but rather\n5See Ortiz, 527 U.S. at 831 (referring to the application of Rule 23 requirements to\nclass representatives as “statutory standing”). \n-5-\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 10/13/06   Page 5 of 10   Document 125 \n\nappear to be examples of courts’ “uncritical reliance . . . on standing-related concepts in\nattempts to articulate the limits of the Rule 23 qualifications.”  Conte & Newberg, supra, at\n§ 2.7.  Some merely assert without analysis that class members must have standing.  Loeb\nIndus. v. Sumitomo Corp.(In re Copper Antitrust Litig.), 196 F.R.D. 348, 353 (W.D. Wis.\n2000); Clay v. American Tobacco Co., 188 F.R.D. 483, 490 (S.D. Ill. 1999).  Others discuss\nthe standing of class representatives.  Harriston v.  Chicago Tribune Co., 992 F.2d 697, 703\n(7th Cir. 1993); Schlesinger v. Reservists Committee to Stop the War, 418 U.S. 208, 216\n(1974).  Yet another is primarily concerned with the requirement that a plaintiff adequately\ndefine the class.  Adashunas v. Negley, 626 F.2d 600, 604 (7th Cir. 1980).  A recent case not\ncited by defendants states that unnamed class members must have standing but then\nconfusingly applies what appears to be a very relaxed standing requirement.  Denney v.\nDeutsche Bank, AG, 443 F.3d 253, 263-64 (2d Cir. 2006).  I find this approach analytically\nmuddled.\nB. Rule 23\nI first discuss defendants’ argument that plaintiffs do not satisfy the implicit requirement\nof Rule 23 that they define an ascertainable class.  A plaintiff’s definition of a proposed class\nmust be precise enough to enable the court to determine whether at any given time a\nparticular individual is or is not a member of the class.  See Alliance to End Represssion v.\nRockford, 565 F.2d 975, 977 (7th Cir. 1977).  A court must be able to resolve the question of\nan individual’s membership by reference to objective criteria.  Elliot v. ITT Corp., 150 F.R.D.\n569, 574 (N.D. Ill. 1992).  However, when a plaintiff attempts to certify a class under Rule\n23(b)(2) for the purpose of seeking injunctive or declaratory relief, a precise class definition\nis less critical.  See Battle v. Commonwealth of Pa., 629 F.2d 269, 271 n.1 (3rd Cir. 1980).\nThe fact that a class includes persons who will become members in the future does not\n-6-\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 10/13/06   Page 6 of 10   Document 125 \n\nrender it impermissibly indefinite.  Probe v. State Teacher’s Ret. Sys., 780 F.2d 776, 780 (9th\nCir. 1986).  Plaintiffs seek certification of a class consisting of disabled Milwaukee County\nresidents who are now or will in the future be eligible to reside in a Family Care AFH or CBRF.\nThis definition is relatively precise and will enable me to determine whether at any given time\na particular individual is a member of the class.  Thus, plaintiffs’ definition is sufficient.\nI turn next to the Rule 23(a) requirements.\n1. Numerosity\nRule 23(a)(1) requires that potential class members be “so numerous that joinder of\nall members is impracticable.”  To satisfy this requirement, a plaintiff need only show that\njoinder would be difficult or inconvenient.  Robidoux v. Celani, 987 F.2d 931, 935 (2nd Cir.\n1993).  A plaintiff will generally meet the requirement by showing that the putative class\nconsists of 40 or more.  Clarke v. Ford Motor Co., 220 F.R.D. 568, 578 (E.D. Wis. 2004).  In\nthe present case, the parties agree that Family Care serves about 5,800 disabled individuals\nin Milwaukee, about 1,080 of whom reside in an AFH or CBRF.  The parties further agree that\nFamily Care will serve additional individuals in the future, some of whom will reside in AFHs\nor  CBRFs.    Thus,  plaintiffs  establish  that  the  proposed  class  meets  the  numerosity\nrequirement.\n2. Commonality\nRule 23(a)(2) requires that there be “questions of law or fact common to the class.”\nGenerally, the presence of a single common legal or factual question is sufficient.  Clarke, 220\nF.R.D. at 579 (stating that the commonality requirement is not demanding because it may be\nsatisfied by a single common issue).  Rule 23(a)(2) generally looks to whether the defendants’\nconduct is common to class members, rather than to whether the result of the conduct is\nuniform among class members.  Rosario, 963 F.2d at 1018.  In the present case, plaintiffs\n-7-\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 10/13/06   Page 7 of 10   Document 125 \n\ncontend that defendants’ policies concerning the compensation of Family Care providers to\nMilwaukee County enrollees violates the ADA and RA.  This is a question of law that is\ncommon to the class.  Thus, plaintiffs satisfy the commonality requirement.\n3. Typicality\nRule 23(a)(3) requires that the claims of the class representative be “typical of the\nclaims . . . of the class.”  Typicality does not require a complete identity of claims.  Clarke, 220\nF.R.D. at 579 (stating that typicality does not require that the named plaintiff be in the same\nposition as every member of the class).  Rather, the critical inquiry is whether the class\nrepresentative’s claims have the same essential characteristics as those of the putative class.\nId.  If the claims arise from a similar course of conduct and share the same legal theory,\nfactual differences will not defeat typicality.  Since the claims only need to share the same\nessential characteristics and need not be identical, the typicality requirement is not highly\ndemanding.  Id.\nIn the present case, plaintiffs’ claims and those of members of the putative class relate\nto the same conduct by defendants and are based on the same legal theory.  Further, as to\neach aggrieved class member, plaintiffs request the same relief.  Defendants argue that\nplaintiffs do not establish typicality because most members of the putative class do not\npresently live in an AFB or CBRF.  However, this factual difference does not defeat typicality,\nas these class members are or will be eligible to live in an AFB or CBRF and thus stand to be\ninjured by any violations of the ADA or RA.  Defendants also argue that plaintiffs do not\nestablish typicality because HIL is the only provider who has notified defendants of its intent\nto withdraw from Family Care.  However, this factual difference also does not defeat typicality\nbecause plaintiffs present evidence indicating that, in the absence of relief, class members\nmay be at risk of being involuntarily transferred in the future.\n-8-\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 10/13/06   Page 8 of 10   Document 125 \n\n4. Adequacy of Representation\nRule 23(a)(4) requires that the named plaintiff adequately represent the proposed\nclass. In determining whether a plaintiff will provide adequate representation, courts consider\nthe adequacy of the class representative and of class counsel.  Retired Chicago Police Ass’n\nv. City of Chicago, 7 F.3d 584, 596 (7th Cir. 1993).  The interest of the representative must\nnot conflict with those of the class and class counsel must be qualified.  In the present case,\ndefendants concede that class counsel is qualified but contend that the named plaintiffs will\nnot adequately represent the class because they have been adjudged incompetent and are\nclosely aligned with service providers, and because their suit would have a negative effect on\nFamily Care as a whole.  However, defendants present nothing supporting their suggestion\nthat the guardians of the named plaintiffs cannot prosecute the present action for the benefit\nof the class.  And the fact that the suit may benefit Family Care providers does not mean that\nit will not also benefit class members.  Additionally, while plaintiffs’ suit might force defendants\nto make changes to Family Care affecting participants outside of the class, such changes\nwould necessarily benefit class members.  Finally, that plaintiffs sue on behalf of a putative\nclass of disabled individuals, rather than merely as HIL residents seeking additional funding\nfor that provider, suggests a commitment to the class as a whole.\nI turn next to Rule 23(b).  In the present case, plaintiffs proceed under Rule 23(b)(2),\nwhich authorizes certification if “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on\ngrounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or\ncorresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.”  To obtain certification\nunder Rule 23(b)(2), the defendant’s conduct need not be directed to or damage every\nmember of the class.  See Baby Neal for and by Kanter v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 58-59 (3rd Cir.\n1994).    Further,  where  a  plaintiff  seeks  primarily  injunctive  relief,  the  Rule  23(b)(2)\n-9-\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 10/13/06   Page 9 of 10   Document 125 \n\nrequirement is almost automatically satisfied.  See Weiss v. York Hospital, 745 F.2d 786, 811\n(3rd Cir. 1984).  In the present case, defendants’ alleged violations of the ADA and RA would\naffect the class and declaratory and injunctive relief would be an appropriate remedy.  As\nsuch, I conclude that class certification under Rule 23(b)(2) is proper.\nIII.  CONCLUSION\nThus, I will grant plaintiff’s motion to certify a class consisting of disabled Milwaukee\nCounty residents who are now or will in the future be eligible to reside in a Family Care AFH\nor CBRF.  However, I will continue to monitor whether certification is proper, whether the\ndefinition of the class is appropriate, and what is required to protect the rights of absentees.\nSee Kuehner v. Heckler, 778 F.2d 152, 163 (3rd Cir. 1985) (indicating that court must monitor\nits own decisions relating to class action status); see also In re “Agent Orange” Prod. Liab.\nLitig., 996 F.2d 1425, 1438 (2nd Cir. 1993) (discussing court’s continuing duty to protect\ninterests of absentees).  These duties are particularly important where as here the class has\nbeen certified under Rule 23(b)(2).  See Lemon v. Int’l Union of Operating Eng'rs. Local No.\n139, AFL-CIO, 216 F.3d 577, 582 (7th Cir. 2000); Jefferson v. Ingersoll Intern. Inc., 195 F.3d\n894, 899 (7th Cir. 1999).\nTherefore,\nIT IS ORDERED that plaintiff’s motion for class certification is GRANTED.\nDated at Milwaukee, Wisconsin, this 13th day of October, 2006.\ns/Lynn Adelman\nLYNN ADELMAN\nU.S. District Judge\n-10-\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 10/13/06   Page 10 of 10   Document 125 ",

Most of this institutional care is and has been funded through the federal Medicaid \nprogram. The reliance on institutions to prov ide residential care has changed over time \nand many persons with disabilities now reside in the community. \n(19)  Persons with disabilities live in a variety of setti ngs and utilize a variety of \nservices.  Many live independently, are em ployed  and otherwise p articipate  in \ncommunity life in ways that are indistinguishable from persons without any disabilities. \n  4\n\n(20)  Many  persons with di sabilities  who req uire  assistance  receive care  \nprovided in their own home by outside caregivers.   \n(21)  Certain persons with disabilities such as developmental disabilities, mental \nillness,  brain injury, Alzheimers, physica l  disabilities, etc. are unable to live \nindependently  in a s ingle-family  home or an apartment. Many of the persons with \ndisabilities who are unable to live independently reside with their families. Many adults  \nwith disabilities acquired before birth or early in life c ontinue to live with their aging \nparents until the death or illness of the caregivers makes that impossible. \n(22)  Persons  with dis abilities  may also   receive  care in various   types of \nresidential facilities that are licensed or cert ified pursuant to Wi sconsin statutes and \nregulations promulgated by the Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services. \n(23)  Many persons with disabilities who receive residential services also attend \nday programs. These are progr ams that provide educational services, assistance with \nand  training in activ ities  of daily liv ing  and recreational activ ities.  Day programs  \nfrequently  include opportunities   for partici pants  to engage in community activities  \nranging from shopping to attending sports events and other recreational activities. A day \nprogram may also include a vocational component. \n(24)  In  Wisconsin and nationally, the  trend  in disability   service  delivery is  \ntowards greater consumer choice and more consumer-directed services. Persons with \ndisabilities  who c an  make the ir  own de cisions  are  permitted to choos e  their own \nproviders and to make their own decisio ns about treatment and care. Guardians an d \nagents under a power of attorney make these same decisions on behalf of persons with \ndisabilities who cannot do so because of the extent of their disabilities.   \n  5\n\n(25)  Individuals  with disabilities  and/or  their guardi ans  or agents choos e \nparticular day programs and places to live for a variety of reasons. The reasons include \nthe  availability of specific dis ability  services, appearance and layout, personal \npreferences  regarding staff an d  other participants or residents, access to public or  \nspecialized  transportation, proximity to chur ches,  proximity to st ores,  proximity to \nrecreational  facilities, accessibility to wo rk  opportunities or vocationa l  services, \nneighborhood characteristics, and closeness to friends and relatives. \n(26)  A great deal of care goes into  choosing a residential facility or a day \nprogram. Individuals may be referred to a particular provider by a County c aseworker \nbased on the general characteristics of the person and the faci lity or program, but that \nwould only be the beginning of the process. Many individuals/guardians/agents choose \na facility or program based on it s proximity to family, friends, recreational activities, \nchurch and a variety of other  community activities. Provider staff, the guardian/agent  \nand the individual himself or herself also try to determine in advance whether the client \nwill  get along well with both  staff  and other residents and pa rticipants  in terms of \npersonalities and similar interests. The inabi lity of certain residents to get along with \neach other is likely to lead to another move. That is the reason that so much attention is \npaid to choosing compatible re sidents, participants and sta ff. Certain individuals also  \nhave special or unusual service needs that could require a specialized service provider. \nAll of these factors could affect the choice of a particular facility or program. \n  (27)  Many Individuals with disabilities develop attachments to the other clients \nand to particular staff members in a residential facility and/or day program.  \n  6\n\n  (28)  Many persons with disabilities have difficulty learning and adapting to new \nsituations. This may c ause behavioral problems when moving from an institution to a \ncommunity setting, from a com munity setting to an institution, or  from one community \nsetting to another as  the individual learns the routine and expec tations of the new \nsetting. \n  (29)  If the services being provided to a person with disabilities are not sufficient \nto meet their needs, there is  an increased probability that  the person will have to be \nmoved to another setting and an increased probability that they will be transferred to a \nmore restrictive facility or institution.    \n(30)  Given the complexity of locating and arranging suitable services, obtaining \nthe approval of the person and/or guardian/ agent, getting through the initial period of  \nadjustment  and the development of relationshi ps  by  the client ,  there is a general \npreference among families, guardians, agents, service providers, County agencies and \nthe clients themselves for remaining in a particular residential setting and day program. \n(31)  Living in one's own home with s ervices is generally more integrated and \nless restrictive than living in a facility su ch as an adult family home, community-based \nresidential facility or nursing home, unless an  individual has certain needs that cannot \nbe met in their own home. \n(32)  Smaller residential settings, 3 or 4-person Adult Family Homes (AFHs) for \nexample, are generally more integrated and less restrictive than larger facilities such as \na 20-person community-based residential facili ties (CBRFs), unless an individual has  \ncertain needs that cannot be met in the smaller setting. \n  7\n\n(33)  The most restrictive form of re sidential placement is a nursing home or \nother institution. Most persons  with disabilities and/or their guardians/agents prefer to  \nlive in the community and receive the services described above outside of an institution \nif they are able to do so. \n(34)  Wis. Stat., §§46.215, 51.42 and 51.437 require each county in Wiscons in \nto provide specified services to persons with disabilities. \n(35)  Wis. Stat., §51.61 requires the State and W isconsin counties, as well a s \nother persons and e ntities providing services to persons with disab ilities, to observe \ncertain  rights that are guar anteed  to persons with ment al  illness, developmental  \ndisabilities, alcoholism or drug dependency. \n(36)  Wis.  Stat., §§55.06 and  55.07  require prescribe certain rights and \nprocedures that are appl icable to persons with disabili ties that are determined by a \nWisconsin Circuit Court to meet the criteria for protective placement. \nFunding for Disability Services \n  (37)  Many  persons with disab ilities  who  require  residential  facilities, day \nprogramming or institutional care are not financ ially able to pay  for the services and \ndepend on public funding sources.  \n  (38)  One source of funding for disability services  in Milwaukee County and in \nother Wisconsin counties are the Medicaid  Waiver programs such as the Community  \nOptions Program (COP), Community Integration Program (CIP) and Brain Injury Waiver \n(BIW). These programs pay for specific services in each state pursuant to various laws \nand regulations and various agreements with  the United States Department of Health \n  8\n\nand Human Services. Waiver programs involv e an approximate 60/40  mix of Federal \nand non-Federal funds. The precise percentage is adjusted from time to time. \n  (39)  If the service needs  of a partic ular person served by one of the Waiver \nprograms increase, the servic e provider will usua lly negotiate a high er rate with the \nfunding  source for continuing to serve t he  person. Wisconsin counties ,  including \nMilwaukee County, have historically granted rate increased in situations of this type. \n  (40)  Even if a particular person's needs do not increa se, the cost of providing \nresidential,  day programming and other disab ility  services  is subject to significa nt \ninflation. The largest expenses of providing disability services are salary and insurance \ncosts. The costs of health car e and health insurance have increased significantly in \nrecent  years and this has caused provider s  to seek increases from their funding \nsources. There have also been  huge increases in liability insur ance across the entire \nresidential care industry.  \n  (41)  While the increases have usua lly been less than the amounts requested,  \ndisability service providers have been able to obtain cost of living rate increases under  \nthe Waiver programs in all Wisc onsin counties and have been able to obtain increase s \nfrom the Disability Services Division of Milwaukee County. \n  (42)  Historically, the Milwaukee County Adult Services Division (now known as \nDisability  Services Divis ion)  had provided services   to persons with dev elopmental \ndisabilities and physical disabilities regardless of age. Over time, the resp onsibility for \nserving persons with these disabilities who were 60 and over was transferred to the  \nMilwaukee  County Department   of Aging (MCDA) which had already been serving \n  9\n\nelderly persons without these specific disabilities. Prior to Family Care, MCDA funde d \nmany of these services using Waiver money. \nFamily Care \n  (43)  The  Wisconsin Family Care progr am  was established by Wis .  Stat., \n§§46.286 - 46.2895 and Wis. Stat., §§46.2805 - 46.2 85 set forth statutory definitions, \nspecify the powers and dutie s of DHFS and the DHFS Se cretary, and govern car e \nmanagement  organizations and resource cent ers.  Wis. Stat., § 46.281  sets out the  \npowers and duties of DHFS and the DHFS Secretary relative to Family Care. \n  (44)  Wis. Stat., §46.281(1)(f) required DHFS to \"[p] rescribe and implement a \nper person monthly rate structure for costs of the family care benefit.\" \n  (45)  Wis. Stat., §46.281(1)(c) requir ed DHFS to negotiate a ne w agreement \nwith the United States Department of Health and Human Serv ices (DHHS) to establish \na capitated system. \n  (46)  DHFS submitted a proposal to  DHHS for a §1915(b) Capitated Waiver  \nprogram (1915(b) waiver) for Milwaukee County Family Care regarding the waiver that \nis currently in effect for Milwaukee County. \n  (47)  The Milwaukee County 1915(b) waiv er application requested that DHHS \nwaive the application of 42  U.S.C. §1396a(a)1 regarding \"st atewideness\", 42 U.S.C. \n§1396a(a)(10)(b)  regarding \"co mparability  of  services\",  and 42   U.S.C. §1396a(a)23  \nregarding \"freedom of choice\". DHHS did subsequently appro ve the waiver of these \nprovisions. \n  (48)  The  Milwaukee County 1915(b) wa iver  application  did not request the \nwaiver of any provisions of the Federal  Medicaid Act other t han those described in \n  10\n\nparagraph 47. All of the other applicable provisions of the Federal Medicaid Act remain \nin  full force and effect with regard to the  portions  of the Family Care program in \nMilwaukee County covered by the 1915(b) waiver at present and at all relevant times. \n  (49)  DHFS also submitted a proposal  to DHHS for two §1915(b) Capitat ed \nWaiver programs regarding the waivers that are currently in effect for Milwaukee County \nto  serve 60 and ov er  persons with dis abilities  (1915(c) disability waiver), and for  \npersons with mental retardation/developmental disabilities (1915(c) MR/DD waiver). \n  (50)  The 1915(c) disability waiver application requested that DHHS waive the \napplication  of 42 U.S.C. §1396a(a)1 r egarding  \"statewideness\",  42 U.S.C. \n§1396a(a)(10)(b)  regarding \"comparability  of  services\", and 42 U.S.C. \n§1396a(a)10(C)(i)(III) regarding \"community deeming rules\". DHHS did s ubsequently \napprove the waiver of these provisions. \n  (51)  The 1915(c) disability waiver application did not request the waiver of any \nprovisions of the Federal Medicaid Act other than those described in paragraph 50. All \nof the other applicable provis ions of the Federal Medicaid Act remain in full force and \neffect with regard to the porti ons of the Family Care progr am covered by the 1915(c)  \ndisability waiver at present and at all relevant times. \n  (52)  The 1915(c) MR/DD waiver app lication requested that DHHS waive th e \napplication  of 42 U.S.C. §1396a(a)1 r egarding  \"statewideness\",  42 U.S.C. \n§1396a(a)(10)(b)  regarding \"comparability  of  services\", and 42 U.S.C. \n§1396a(a)10(C)(i)(III) regarding \"community deeming rules\". DHHS did s ubsequently \napprove the waiver of these provisions. \n  11\n\n  (53)  The 1915(c) MR/DD waiver application did not r equest the waiver of any \nprovisions of the Federal Medicaid Act other than those described in paragraph 52. All \nof the other applicable provis ions of the Federal Medicaid Act remain in full force and \neffect with regard to the porti ons of the Family Care program covered by the 1915(c)  \nMR/DD waiver at present and at all relevant times. \n  (54)  DHFS  offered contracts to vari ous  Wisconsin c ounties  to begin the \noperation of Family Care. \n(55)  Milwaukee  County DSD contin ues  to  utilize the Waiver programs for \npersons under 60, but Milwaukee County decided to sign a contract with DHFS to place \nall eligible persons 60 and over into Family Care. It was under no obligation to do so. \n  (56)  In 2000, MCDA began to operate its disability services under the umbrella \nof Family Care. Under Family Care MCDA receives a specific monthly payment from the \nState  for each eligible pers on  enrolled in Family Care .  MCDA then contracts with \nvarious agencies and service providers who deliver services to a specific person. \n(57)  Pursuant to Waiver program policies and procedures established by DSD \nand DHFS, Milwaukee County residents with di sabilities under the age of 60, or their \nguardians  or agents if appropr iate,  are generally permitted to select and approv e \nspecific day programs and residential settings. \n(58)  Pursuant to Family Care policie s and procedures establis hed by MCDA \nand DHFS, the ability of Milwaukee County residents 60 and over, or their guardians or \nagents  if appropriate, to select and approve  specific  day programs and residential  \nsettings is substantially limited by MCDA's practice of placing individuals based on cost \nand administrative convenience rather than client choice.  \n  12\n\n (59)  Pursuant to Waiver program policies and procedures established by DSD \nand  DHFS,  persons with dis abilities  are  evaluated for potential serv ices  using \nprocedures that focus on the c apacity of the individ ual for independent living. This \nresults  in many persons with signific ant  disabilities who do receive funding for \ncommunity services instead of institutional care.   \n(60)  Pursuant to Family Care policie s and procedures establis hed by MCDA \nand  DHFS,  persons with dis abilities  are  evaluated for potential serv ices  using \nprocedures that focus more narrowly on the  medical needs of the individual. The result \nis that many fewer persons with significant  disabilities receive funding for community \nservices.  The evaluation proces s  also has   a  negative  effect on the right   to obtain \nappropriate  placement and services in the least restrictive setting in  Watts  review \nproceedings and proceedings in general held under Wis. Stat., Chapter 55 for persons \nin Family Care.  \n(61)  Pursuant to Family Care policie s and procedures establis hed by MCDA \nand DHFS, Family Care does not automatically  enroll eligible indi viduals who are in \nnursing homes or other institutions, or who are in the process of entering nursing homes \nor other institutions.  \n(62)  Pursuant to Family Care policie s and procedures establis hed by MCDA \nand DHFS, numerous persons in nursing homes  who are eligible for Family Care and \nwho  could reside in the co mmunity  if evaluated usi ng  appropriate professiona l \nstandards and judgment have not  been enrolled in F amily Care and therefore remain \ninstitutionalized.   \n  13\n\n(63)  Pursuant to Waiver program policies and procedures established by DSD \nand DHFS, day and residential providers hav e been granted rate increases from DSD \nfor serving Milwaukee County residents with disabilities under the age of 60.  \n(64)  Under Family Care policies and procedures established by MCDA and \nDHFS, day and residential providers have not been granted rate increases from MCDA \nfor serving Milwaukee County residents disabilities 60 years of age and older. \n(65)  The  capitated rate set by DHF S  is  insufficient to provide appropriate \nservices to persons with disabilities in Milwaukee County. \n(66)  A mail survey of Family Care pr oviders around the State conducted in \nJanuary  and February of 2004 by Dr. Gerald  Kallas  of Senior Residential Care of  \nAmerica, Inc. showed that 80% of the respondents said that they were being paid below \ntheir cost of care as dete rmined by an audit. Only 8.5%  of the respondents said they  \nwere being paid equal to their cost of care  and 5.7% said they were being paid abov e \ntheir cost of care.  \n(67)  The failure to provide reasonable ra tes and cost of living rate increases  \nhas and will cause service providers to either cut the level of services or refuse to serve \nMilwaukee County residents wit h disabilities with the result that they will b e forced to \nmove from their homes and to lose other disa bility services. This will cause substantial \nnumbers of these residents to be admitted to in stitutions such as nursing homes. Many \nMilwaukee County residents who are already in nursing homes and other institutions will \nremain there if service providers are unwilling to serve them under the Family Care rate \nstructure. \n    \n  14\n\nGerald Nelson \n  (68)  Gerald Nelson has a developmental disability and a physical disability. He \nis 71 years old. \n  (69)  Mr. Nelson resided in his family's home until his mother became too ill to \ncare for him in November of 1998. Milwa ukee County then placed him temporarily in a  \ncommunity-based residential facility (CBRF) operated by Homes for Independent Living \nlocated in Menomonee Falls.  \n(70)  Shortly before his mother's death in January of 1999, Milwaukee County \nplaced Mr. Nelson at Whitnall House, another CBRF operated by HIL in Hales Corners. \nHe  also began to r eceive  day program se rvices  at Paragon  Industries  which  is \nassociated with HIL. \n(71)  Mr. Nelson's guardian approved of  his admission to Whitnall House and \nthe Paragon day program.  \n(72)  It is the guardian's  continued desire that Mr. Nelson remain at  Whitnall \nHouse and Paragon.  \n(73)  Milwaukee County filed Watts reports with the Milwaukee County Probate \nCourt stating that Mr. Nelson 's placement at Whitnall H ouse was appropriate to his \nneeds and recommending that his placement there continue. \n(74)  Mr. Nelson receives funding for his  disability services from Famil y Care \nthrough Milwaukee County Department on Aging (MCDA). \n(75)  The  rates that MCDA have approv ed  for HIL to serve Mr. Nelson at  \nWhitnall House and Paragon are lower than the rates being paid to HIL by Milwauk ee \nCounty DSD and by other Wisconsin counties for serving individuals with similar needs. \n  15\n\n(76)  HIL attempted over the course of several years to negotiate with MCDA to \nobtain a higher daily rate for providing services to Mr. Nelson and other clients. \n(77)  MCDA has refused to approve a cost  of living rate increase for Gerald \nNelson or any other MCDA client. \n(78)  HIL gave notice that it would termi nate its contract wit h MCDA effective \nApril 1, 2004. HIL later  signed an agreement to continue  serving Mr. Nelson at the \nexisting rates. \n(79)  HIL  will c ontinue  to contract   with DSD to serve   Milwaukee  County \nresidents with disabilities under the age of 60. HIL has notified MCDA t hat it would \nprefer to continue serving Mr. Nelson and all other M CDA clients and that the funding  \ndispute is the only reason for the contract termination. \n(80)  MCDA intends to move Mr. Nels on to a different CBRF and day program \nover the guardian's objection and has stated that it will seek the guardian 's removal if \nthe disagreement continues, however, pursuant  to a stipulation entered in this action , \nMCDA has agreed that it will not move Mr. Nelson over the guardian's objection pending \nresolution of the issues in this action or further order of the Court. \n(81)  It would be very traumatic and harmf ul to Gerald Ne lson to be forcibly  \nremoved from his home. \n(82)  Due to the severity of Gerald Nelson' s disabilities, it is likely that moving \nhim would worsen his condition and lead to  placement in a nur sing home or similar \ninstitution.   \nJoan Bzdawka \n(83)  Joan Bzdawka has a developmental disability. She is 68 years old. \n  16\n\n  (84)  Ms. Bzdawka resided in the co mmunity with her family until 1955. She \nwas then placed in the Milwaukee County M ental Health Complex until 1968 when she \nwas transferred to the Centra l Wisconsin Center for the  Developmentally Disabled, \nanother large institution.  \n(85)  Ms. Bzdawka was transferred from Central Center in 1995 to a succession \nof CBRFs in Milwaukee County. She moved to Vienna House in 1996 and Arbor House \nin 2000. Both houses are operated by HIL. She also attends the Paragon day program. \nEach of the transfers to a CBRF and to  the Paragon program was with her guardian's \napproval. \n(86)  It is the guardian's  continued desire that Ms. Bzdawka remain at Arbor \nHouse and Paragon.  \n(87)  Milwaukee County filed Watts reports with the Milwaukee County Probate \nCourt stating that Ms. Bzdawka' s placement at Vienna House  and Arbor House was  \nappropriate to her needs and recommending that her placement there continue. \n(88)  Ms. Bzdawka receives funding for her disability services from Family Care. \n(89)  The rates that MCDA  have approved for HIL to serve Ms. Bzdawka at \nArbor House and Paragon are lower than the rates being  paid to HIL by  Milwaukee \nCounty DSD and by other Wisconsin counties for serving individuals with similar needs. \n(90)  HIL attempted over the course of  several years to obtain a rate increase \nfrom MCDA to obtain a higher  daily rate fo r providing services to Ms. Bzdawka and \nother clients. MCDA has refused to approve a cost of living rate increase. \n(91)  MCDA  intends to move Ms. Bzdawka to a different CBRF   and da y \nprogram over the guardian's ob jection and has stated that it will seek the  guardian's \n  17\n\nremoval if the disagreement continues, however, pursuant to a stipulation entered in this \naction,  MCDA has agreed that   it will not move Ms. Bzdawka over the guardian' s \nobjection pending resolution of the issues in this action or further order of the Court. \n(92)  It would be very traumatic and harmf ul to Ms. Bzdawka to be forcibly  \nremoved from her home. \n(93)  Due to the severity of Ms. Bzdawka's disabilities, it is likely that moving her \nwould  worsen  her c ondition  and lead to pl acement  in a nursing home or similar  \ninstitution. \nSandra Ehrlichman \n(94)  Sandra Ehrlichman has a developmental disability. She is 60 years old. \n  (95)  Ms. Ehrlichman resided in the comm unity with her family until 1960. She \nwas then placed in the Southern Wisconsin Center for the Developmentally Disabled.  \n(96)  Ms. Ehrlichman was transferred from Southern Wisconsin Center to Arbor \nHouse in 2000. She also attends the Par agon day program. The tr ansfer to Arbor \nHouse and to the Paragon program was with her guardian's approval. \n(97)  It is the guardian's continued desire  that Ms. Ehrlichman remain at Arbor  \nHouse and Paragon.  \n(98)  Ms. Ehrlichman receives fundin g for her disability services from Family \nCare. Prior to her 60th birthday she received Waiver funding through DSD. \n(99)  The rates that MCDA have appr oved for HIL to serve Ms. Erlichman at \nArbor House and Paragon are lower than the rates being  paid to HIL by  Milwaukee \nCounty DSD and by other Wisconsin counties for serving individuals with similar needs. \n  18\n\n(100)  HIL attempted over the course of  several years to obtain a rate increase \nfrom MCDA to obtain a higher daily rate fo r providing services to Ms. Erlichman and \nother clients. MCDA has refused to approve a cost of living rate increase. \n(101)  MCDA  intends  to move Ms. Er lichman  to a different CBRF and da y \nprogram over the guardian's ob jection and has stated that it will seek the  guardian's \nremoval if the disagreement continues, however, pursuant to a stipulation entered in this \naction,  MCDA has agreed that   it will not   move Ms. Er lichman  over the guardian 's \nobjection pending resolution of the issues in this action or further order of the Court. \n(102)  It would be very traumatic and harmf ul to Ms. Ehrlichman to be forcibly  \nremoved from her home. \n(103)  Due to the severity of Ms. Ehrlichman' s disabilities, it is likely that moving \nwould  worsen  her c ondition  and lead to pl acement  in a nursing home or similar  \ninstitution. \nMarilyn Berdikoff \n(104)  Marilyn Berdikoff has a developmental disability. She is 60 years old.  \n(105)  Ms. Berdikoff resides at Vienna  House, a CBRF operated by HIL and \nattends the Paragon day program. The admission to Vienna House and to the Paragon \nprogram was with her guardian's approval. \n(106)  Ms. Ehrlichman receives fundin g for her disability services from Family \nCare. Prior to her 60th birthday she received Waiver funding through DSD. \n(107)  It is the guardian's continued desire t hat Ms. Berdikoff remain at Vienna \nHouse and Paragon. \n  19\n\n(108)  The rates that MCDA have approv ed for HIL to serve Ms. Berdikoff at \nVienna House and Paragon are lower than the  rates being paid to HIL by Milwauke e \nCounty DSD and by other Wisconsin counties for serving individuals with similar needs.  \n(109)  HIL attempted over the course of  several years to obtain a rate increase \nfrom MCDA to obtain a higher  daily rate for providing services to Ms. Berdikoff and \nother clients. MCDA has refused to approve a cost of living rate increase. \n(110)  MCDA  intends to move Ms. Berdikoff to a different CBRF   and da y \nprogram over the guardian's ob jection and has stated that it will seek the  guardian's \nremoval if the disagreement continues, however, pursuant to a stipulation entered in this \naction,  MCDA has a greed  that it will not   move  Ms. Berdikoff over the guardian 's \nobjection pending resolution of the issues in this action or further order of the Court. \n(111)  It would be very traumatic and harmf ul to Ms. Berdiko ff to be forcibly  \nremoved from her home. \n(112)  Due to the severity of Ms. Berdikoff's disabilities, it is likely that moving her \nwould  worsen  her c ondition  and lead to pl acement  in a nursing home or similar  \ninstitution. \nLenore Czarnecki \n(113)  Lenore Czarnecki has Alzheimers disease, a disability associated with the \naging process. She is 81 years old. \n(114)  Ms. Czarnecki resided at home with her husband until four years ago. She \nwas then placed in a CBRF operated by Senior Residential Care of America, Inc. \n(115)  Ms. Czaernecki receives fundin g for her disability services from Family \nCare. \n  20\n\n(116)  It is the desire of her family and her agent, Carolyn Cetnarowski, that Ms. \nCzarnecki remain at her current residence.  \n(117)  Senior Residential Care of America, Inc. has attempted to obtain a rate \nincrease  from MCDA for providing servic es  to  Family Care c lients,  but MCDA has  \nrefused to approve a cost of living rate increase.  \n(118)  MCDA has reduced the rates paid  to Senior Residential Care under the \ncurrent contracts in comparison to previous contracts. \n(119)  Senior  Residential Care has issued  public  statements that it is losing \nmoney under current Family Car e rates and will not be able to sustain these loses for \nmuch longer. \n(120)  It is probable that in the forese eable future Senior Residential Care will \nrefuse to accept Family Care clients or will have to close its residential facilities entirely. \n(121)  It would be very traumatic and harmf ul to Ms. Czarnecki to be forcibly  \nremoved from her home. \n  (122)  Due to the severity of Ms. Czarnecki's disability, it is likely that moving her \nwould  worsen  her c ondition  and lead to pl acement  in a nursing home or similar  \ninstitution. \nJohn Gorton \n(123)  John Gorton has physical and mental disabilities. He is 77 years old. \n(124)  Mr.  Gorton resided in his ow n  home until 1997 when his   condition \nworsened significantly. He was hospitalized and then placed in various nursing homes. \nAfter trying several assisted living facilities, approximately 2 ½ years ago h e was then \nplaced in a CBRF operated by Senior Residential Care of America, Inc. \n  21\n\n(125)  Mr. Gorton receives funding for his disability services from Family Care.  \n(126)  It is the desire of his family and his agent, Deborah Brunk, that Mr. Gorton \nremain at his current residence. \n(127)  Senior  Residential Care has issued  public  statements that it is losing \nmoney under current Family Car e rates and will not be able to sustain these loses for \nmuch longer.  \n(128)  It is probable that in the forese eable future Senior Residential Care will \nrefuse to accept Family Care clients or will have to close its residential facilities entirely. \n(129)  It  would be very traumatic and ha rmful  to Mr. Gorton to be forcibly \nremoved from his home. \n(130)  Due to the severity of Mr. Gorton's  disability, it is likely that moving him  \nwould  worsen  his c ondition  and lead to pl acement  in a nursing home or similar \ninstitution. \nClassie Marcilis\n(131)  Classie  Marcilis has   a developm ental  disability  and  other mental \ndisabilities. He is 60 years old. \n(132)  Mr. Marcilis has lived in his own home with supportive services provided  \nby Dungarvin, a national disability services provider. Services were funded through DSD \nuntil his 60th birthday last year.  \n(133)  For some time prior to and at the time of his 60th birthday, Dungarvin was \npaid $135.33 per day  to provide supportive se rvices through waiver funding that was \narranged by DSD. \n  22\n\n(134)  Since  his 60th birthd ay,  funding  for  Mr. Marcilis's services h ave  been \nfunded through Family Care. The daily rate  paid to Dungarvin for providing supportive \nservices was reduced to $111.16 per day.  \n(135)  The Family Care Program has reassessed Mr. Marcilis's daily living skills. \nThis reassessment is expect ed to further reduce his leve l of funding for supportive \nservices and make it more likely that he will  have to move to a larger m ore restrictive \nsetting for reasons of cost. \n(136)  It is probable that in the foreseeabl e future Dungarvin will refuse to serve \nMr. Marcilis for the rates that MCDA and Famiily Care clients have and will authorize. \n(137)  It is the desire of his f amily and his guardian, Dorothy Reynolds, that Mr. \nMarcilis  remain at his current residenc e  and  that he not be transferred to a more  \nrestrictive and less integrated setting such as a CBRF or nursing home. \n(138)  It  would be very traumatic and harmf ul  to Mr. Marcilis to be forcibly \nremoved from his home. \n  (139)  Due to the severity of Mr. Marcilis's disability, it is likely that moving would \nworsen his condition and lead to placement in a nursing home or similar institution.   \nConstance Ewig \n(140)  Constance Ewig has developmental disabilities. She is 60 years old. \n(141)  Ms.  Ewig resided at home with her   family until her mother's death \napproximately 10 years ago. She then res ided in a series of apartments with variou s \nservices and intermittent periods of hospitalization. Several years ago she was placed in \nHearthside  Rehabilitation C enter,  a large institution fo r  persons with development al \ndisabilities. \n  23\n\n(142)  Until  March of 2004, Ms. Ewig wa s  eligible for services through the \nMilwaukee County Disabilities Services Division (DSD). In March of 2004, she reached \nher 60th birthday and now receives funding for her disability services from Family Care \nthrough MCDA. \n(143)  In 2003, Hearthside was in the pr ocess of closing and Ms. Ewig wa s \nmoved to a CBRF. DSD had difficulty locat ing enough community residences for all of \nthe Hearthside residents and she was referr ed to Takodah House, a CBRF in Fond du \nLac which is operated by Lifeline Services. \n(144)  Ms. Ewig has been more successful and more satisfied at Takodah House \nthan at any of her other residences since her mother died. \n(145)  Constance Ewig likes Takodah House and would like to remain there. She \nalso likes her doctor, psychiatrist, day program and friends in Fond du Lac. \n(146)  When Ms. Ewig turned 60, Lifeline Se rvices was notified by MCDA that it  \nwould not be offered a contract to serve her  under Family Care and that she would be  \nmoved to a different CBRF that is located within Milwaukee County. \n(147)  Ms. Ewig filed a petition for administrative review of this decision.   \n(148)  Following  a  hearing  on Ms. Ewig's   petition,  Administrative  Law Judge \nJoseph A. Nowick issued a decision on July 20, 2004 upholding the decision to move \nher  to another CBRF   instead of directing  MCDA  and the Family   Care program to \ncontract with Lifeline Services and Takodah House so that she could remain in Fond du \nLac County. \n(149)  On August 11, 2004, Ms. Ewig f iled an appeal from the administrative \ndecision pursuant to Wis. Stat., §227.53.  Ewig v. Wisconsin Department of Health and \n  24\n\nFamily Services, et al., Case No. 04-CV-007043 (Milwaukee  County Circuit Court). On \nAugust 12, 2004, her counsel in that cas e, Atty. Patrick Berigan from the Wiscons in \nCoalition for Advocacy, moved for a stay  of the State cour t proceeding pending the \noutcome of this action. That motion remains pending at this time.  \n(150)  It would be very traumatic and harmful to Ms. Ewig to be forcibly removed \nfrom her home. \n  (151)  Due to the severity of Ms. Ewig's  disability, it is likely that moving he r \nwould  worsen  her c ondition  and lead to pl acement  in a nursing home or similar  \ninstitution. \nBert Siegel \n  (152)  Bert Siegel has phys ical disabilities resulting from multiple sclerosis. He \nwas first diagnosed in 1983 and is now 60 years old. \n  (153)  Mr. Siegel was able to live  independently until 2000. He was unable to \nwalk following surgery that year and has requi red assistance since that time. His sister \nbegan to provide care at that time. She moved here from another State and gave up her \njob in order to do so. She was paid by wa iver funding through DSD until Mr. Siegel \nturned 60 years old and became eligible for Family Care. \n  (154)  Mr. Siegel is non-ambulatory and has  very limited mobility in his uppe r \nbody. He is quite large and mus t use a Hoyer  lift for transfers in and out of his bed or  \nwheelchair. He requires assistance to reposition himself and with other activities of daily \nliving. It is necessary for someone to provide this care 24 hours per day.    \n  (155)  For some time prior to and at t he time of Mr. Siegel' s 60th birthday, his  \nsister was being paid $8.00 per hour for 46 hours per week of supportive home care. \n  25\n\n  (156)  Following  Mr. Siegel 's  admission into Family Car e,  his sister was \napproved to provide 46 hours per week of supportive home care at a lower rate of $7.30 \nper hour. She was paid an additional $25 per night  flat rate to provide care as needed \nduring her sleeping hours. \n  (157)  DHFS issued a memorandum dated March 1, 2004 regarding \"Guidelines \nfor  Paying Family   Caregivers\". The ac tual  Guidelines  were attached to the \nmemorandum. \n  (158)  MCDA and its cont ractors conducted a reevaluat ion of Mr. Siegel's care \npursuant  to the March 1, 2004 memor andum  and guidelines. Follo wing  this \nreevaluation, the hours of supportive home care by his sister that were aut horized for \npayment through Family Care  were reduced from 46 hours to 32 hour s per week. \nAuthorization for the $25 per night flat overnight rate was eliminated entirely. \n  (159)  Mr. Siegel's sister will have to find another source of income outside of the \nhome because of the funding c uts and will be  unable to care f or him as she is  now \ndoing. \n  (160)  Due to the severity of Mr. Siegel's di sability, it is likely  that the failure to \nprovide  sufficient  funding for supportive home care will le ad  to his placement in a \nnursing home or similar institution. \n  (161)  It would be very traumatic and harmful to Mr. Siegel to be forcibly removed \nfrom his home. \nKathleen Johnson \n  (162)  Kathleem  Johnson has disabiliti es  resulting from a severe medical \ncondition which was diagnosed in early 2003. She is 69 years old. \n  26\n\n  (163)  Ms.  Johnson lived independently  in  her own home until she was  \nhospitalized  with gastro-intes tinal  bleeding. Her condition was so severe that he \nphysician advised placement in  a nursing home. Instead,  she returned home and her \ndaughter has lived with her in order to provi de care. Ms. Johnson is restricted to her \nbed. She is unable to walk or transfer without assistance. She is unable to eat anything \nby mouth and is tube-fed through a port whic h has been surgically implanted in her  \nstomach. She requires around-the-clock assistance.   \n  (164)  Ms. Johnson's daughter, who was  previously employed as a pharmacy \ntechnician, was unable to work because of the extensive care that she was providing to \nher mother. Family Care made arrangement s to pay the daught er for 38.5 hours per \nweek of supportive home care and 28 hours per week of personal care services.   \n  (165)  DHFS issued a memorandum dated March 1, 2004 regarding \"Guideline s \nfor  Paying Family   Caregivers\". The ac tual  Guidelines  were attached to the \nmemorandum. \n  (166)  MCDA and its contractors conducted a reevaluation of Ms. Johnson's care \npursuant  to the March 1, 2004 memor andum  and guidelines. Follo wing  this \nreevaluation, the hours of s upportive home care by her daughter that were authorized \nfor payment through Family Care were r educed from 38.5 hours  to 2 hours per week. \nThe hours of personal care services will also be reduced.  \n  (167)  Ms. Johnson's daughter will have to find another source of income outside \nof the home because of the funding cuts and will be unable to care for her as she is now \ndoing.  \n  27\n\n  (168)  Due to the severity of Ms. Johnson's disability, it is likely that the failure to \nprovide sufficient funding for supportive hom e care will lead to her plac ement in a \nnursing home or similar institution. \n  (169)  It  would be very traumatic and  harmful  to Ms. Johnson to be forcibly  \nremoved from her home.     \nClass Certification \n(170)  The named plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalf and also seek to \nrepresent a class of Milwauk ee County residents who now  qualify or who will in the \nfuture qualify for services through the Family Care program. \n(171)  Approximately 5,200 Milwaukee County residents are currently enrolled in \nFamily Care. There are at least another  10,000 Milwaukee County residents in nursing \nfacilities or living in the community who would meet the eligibility standards for Family \nCare. \n(172)  Approximately  5,000  persons with devel opmental  and/or physica l \ndisabilities who are u nder age 60 currently  receive services through the Milwauk ee \nCounty Disability Services Division. \n(173)  Several  hundred of  the  approximately 5,000 clie nts  currently receiving \nservices from DSD receive res idential or other disability services outside of  Milwaukee \nCounty. \n(174)  Approximately 1,000 individuals with disabilities receive care from family \ncaregivers and hundreds of those indiv iduals have had their level of funding reduce d \nsince the March 1, 2004 memorandum and gui delines described above in paragraph s \n157 and 165. \n  28\n\n  (175)  The number of persons currently  receiving developmental disability (DD) \nor physical disability (PD) services from Milwaukee County DSD who will turn 60 during  \neach calendar year from now until 2010 is as follows: \n      Year       DD Clients     PD Clients        Total\n    2004    44    104    148 \n    2005    52    135    187 \n    2006    59    134    193 \n    2007    62    160    222 \n    2008    61    139    200 \n    2009    90    116    206 \n    2010    72    119    191 \n \n  (176)  All  of the approxim ately  5,000 clients cur rently  receiving DD and PD \nservices from DSD will eventually turn 60 if they live long enough. \n  (177)  The number of persons with dis abilities who are now or will in the future \nbe  affected by F amily  Care polic ies  and  procedures  is v ery  large  and it would  \nimpractical to bring them all before the Court. \n(178)  Each  year additiona l  persons with disabilitie s  are born in Milwauk ee \nCounty, and each year additional persons without disabilities residing in Milwauk ee \nCounty become disabled through accidents, injuries, disease and/or the progression of \nthe aging process.  \n(179)  It would impossible to identify or bring these unidentified future members \nof the putative class before the Court. \n(180)  The requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure have \nbeen met in that: (a) it is im possible to identify future  members of the class and the \nnumber  of persons already se rved  by DSD w ho  will transfer to Family   Care is s o \nnumerous that joinder of all class members is impractical; (b) there are questions of law \n  29\n\nor fact common to the class; (c) the claims  of the representative parties are typical of \nthe claims of the class; and (d) the repr esentative parties will  fairly and adequately \nprotect the interests of the class.   \n(181)  Pursuant  to Rule 2 3(b)(2),  Milwaukee  County,  DHFS  and Secretary \nNelson have acted or refused to act on  grounds generally applicable to the putative \nclass,  thereby making appropriate prelim inary  and final injunctive relief and/or  \ncorresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole. \nLEGAL CLAIMS \nCount One: Americans with Disabilities Act \nDiscrimination on the Basis of Disability\n \n  (182)  The previous allegation are incorporated here as if fully set forth. \n  (183)  The  individual  plaintiffs and t he  putative class members are “qualified \nindividuals with a disability” pursuant to

accommodated. \n(196)  MCDA,  DHFS and Se cretary  Nelson are obligated by the ADA to \nadminister programs in a manner that supports the availability of programs and services \nfor persons with disabilities in the most integrated setting.  \n(197)  The above-described acts, omissions, policies and procedures of MCDA,  \nDHFS  and  Secretary Nelson d iscriminate  against  persons  with disab

other persons in order to receive care for their \ndisabilities form and maintain relationships with the other persons in their home that are \nsimilar to family relationships. They also form personal relationships and attachments to \nother persons at day programs and employment programs for  persons with disabilities. \nThese are small groups  with a high degree of  selectivity in the process of forming the \nrelationship that are private and exclude outsiders to the same degree as any family. \n  (215)  Small  groups that   have a high degree of selectivity in forming and \nmaintaining  their relationship and that secl ude  others  from cri tical  aspects  of the \nrelationship are protected by the Bill of Rights and especially the First Amendment from \nunjustified interference by the State. \n  (216)  Persons  with disabilities hav e  a  substantial  liberty int erest  in p ersonal \nautonomy and in being free from unnecessary re strictions on personal liberty under \nState and Federal law.    \n  (217)  Persons with disabilities under t he age of 60 who are eligib le to receive \nservices from Milwaukee County are situated similarly to persons with disa bilities who \nare 60 years of age and older  who are elig ible to receive services from Milwauke e \nCounty except for the differential treatment described above. \n  37\n\n  (218)  Persons with more si gnificant disabilities who are 60 and over and who \nare eligible to receive services from Milwaukee County are situated similarly to persons \nwith less significant disabilities who are 60 and over  and who are eligible to receive \nservices from Milwaukee County except for the differential treatment described above.  \n(219)  The above-described acts, omissions, policies and procedures of MCDA,  \nDHFS  and  Secretary Nelson d iscriminate  against  persons  with disab ilities  in the  \nfollowing ways: (a)  individuals  being  served  by  Family  Care  in Milwa ukee  County \nreceive inferior treatment as compared to similar individuals being served by Milwaukee \nCounty DSD and in other c ounties by the Waiver prog rams, and (b) individuals with \nmore severe disabilities being served by Milwaukee County Family Care receive inferior \ntreatment as compared to similar individuals with less severe disabilities being served \nby Milwaukee County Family Care. \nCount Eight: 42 U.S.C. §1983 and the Medicaid Act \n \n  (220)  The previous allegation are incorporated here as if fully set forth. \n  (221)  The Medical Assistance (Medicaid) program is authorized under Title XIX \nof the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. §1396 et seq. \n  (222)  The purpose of Title  XIX is to \"enabl[e] each St ate . . . to furnish . . .  \nrehabilitation and other services to help such  families and individuals attain or retain \ncapacity for independence and self-care.\" 42 U.S.C. §1396. \n  (223)  The Federal Medicaid Act provides: \nA State plan for medical assistance  must . . . provide such methods and \nprocedures relating to the utiliza tion of, and the payment for, care and \nservices available under the plan . . . as may be nec essary to safeguard \nagainst unnecessary utilization of such  care and services and to assure \nthat payments are consistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care \nand are sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services are \n  38\n\navailable under the plan at least to the extent that such care and services \nare available to the general population in the geographic area; . . . \n \n42 U.S.C. §1396a(a)(30)(A). \n \n  (224)  The State of Wisconsin, DHFS and the Secretary of DHFS have chosen to \nparticipate in the Medicaid program. \n  (225)  DHFS and the Secretary of DHFS have not sought or obtained a waiver of \n42  U.S.C. §1396a(a)(30)(A) in connection wit h  the operation of Family Care in \nMilwaukee County. \n  (226)  The above-described acts, omissions, policies and procedures of MCDA,  \nDHFS and Secretary Nelson viol ate Title XIX because they  are inconsistent with the \nrequirements of \"efficiency, economy and  quality of care\" and further, because the \nFamily  Care funding scheme and rate stru cture  is not \"sufficient to enlist enough \nproviders so that care and services are avai lable under the plan at least to the extent  \nthat such care and services are availabl e to the general populati on in the geographic \narea.\" 42 U.S.C. §1396a(a)(30)(A). \nCount Nine: Wis.

Stat. § 46.287(2)(b), may contest \nthe choice of residential or day services provider proposed by the CMO by pursuing \nFamily Care grievance procedures or a fair hearing; and (2) that the standard to be \napplied in resolving any such disputes is whether the proposed plan wOllld provide \ncare, treatment or supports that are insufficient to meet the participant's needs or \noutcomes, or are provided in a setting that is unnecessarily restrictive or less integrated \nthan is appropriate to the participant's needs.  The contract interpretation memo will \nstate the importance of following the notice procedures required by Wis. Admin.

Lautenschlager, Attorney General, submit this \nbrief  in  support  of  their  motion  for  certification  of  the  Court’s  interlocutory  Order  filed \nFebruary 7, 2006, for appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 94     Filed 02/23/2006     Page 2 of 7 \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n  Plaintiffs are all aged sixty or over and are either developmentally-disabled or suffer from \nthe disabilities of aging.  In their Fourth Amended Complaint, they allege nine separate claims on \nbehalf of themselves and a putative class based on the Americans with Disabilites Act (“ADA”), \n42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 701 et seq., and on 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396a(a)(30)(A), the “equal access” provision of the Medical Assistance (“Medicaid”) Act, \nTitle XIX of the Social Security Act.  They allege that the defendants, including the Wisconsin \nDepartment of Health and Family Services (“DHFS”), DHFS Secretary Helene Nelson and \nMilwaukee County, are discriminating against themselves on the basis of their disabilities and \nviolating § 1396a(a)(30)(A) of the Medicaid Act by refusing to increase the rates paid to their \nproviders of residential, community-based services.   \n  After  answering  the  Fourth  Amended  Complaint,  both  the  State  and  the  County \ndefendants moved to dismiss, challenging the plaintiffs’ standing to attack the capitated rates \npaid by DHFS to Milwaukee County and the rates the County pays their providers, as well as the \nsufficiency of all nine claims of the latest amended complaint.  On February 7, 2006, the Court \nissued an interlocutory Decision and Order partially granting some of defendants’ motions, \nagreeing that plaintiffs have alleged no past injuries to themselves and, therefore, lack standing to \npursue  retroactive  monetary  and  declaratory  relief.    The  Court  also  limited  plaintiffs’ \ndiscrimination  claims  to  forms  of  discrimination based on the ADA or Rehabilitation Act, \neliminating allegations of age discrimination or discrimination based on county of residency.   \n  In all other respects, however, the Court denied the motions to dismiss, concluding that \nplaintiffs  have  standing  to  seek  prospective  relief  based  on  the  alleged  inadequacy  of  the \ncapitated rates paid by DHFS to Milwaukee County and, in turn, the rates Milwaukee County is \n- 2 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 94     Filed 02/23/2006     Page 3 of 7 \nwilling to pay plaintiffs’ providers.  In addition, the Court concluded that all nine claims survive, \neither  entirely  or  in  part,  the  defendants’  motions  for  judgment  on  the  pleadings, \nF.R.C.P. 12(b)(6) and 12(c).  In particular, the Court concluded that § 1396a(a)(30)(A) of the \nMedicaid Act creates a private right of action enforceable under the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § \n1983 (see Order at 18-21).   \n  The State defendants now move the Court to amend the February 7 Order to include a \nstatement certifying the interlocutory order for appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b).  As \nfurther argued below, the Order presents two controlling questions of law—plaintiffs’  standing \nto seek prospective relief and whether § 1396a(a)(30)(A) creates a private right of action for \nMedicaid  recipients—as  to  which  there  are  substantial  grounds  for  difference  of  opinion.  \nMoreover, an immediate appeal from the Order is likely to advance materially the ultimate \ntermination of this litigation. \nARGUMENT \nCERTIFICATION IS APPROPRIATE BECAUSE THE FEBRUARY 7, 2006, \nORDER  FULFILLS  THE  CRITERIA  FOR  AN  IMMEDIATE  APPEAL \nREQUIRED BY 28 U.S.C. § 1292(B). \n  The  State  defendants  request  the  certification  from  this  Court  necessary  to  seek \nimmediate  review  by  the  court  of  appeals  of  the  interlocutory  Order  of  February 7, 2006.  \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b),  \n  When a district judge, in making in a civil action an order not otherwise \nappealable under this section, shall be of the opinion that such order involves a \ncontrolling question of law as to which there is a substantial ground for difference \nof opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance \nthe ultimate termination of the litigation, he shall so state in writing in such order. \nThe Court of Appeals which would have jurisdiction of an appeal of such action \nmay thereupon, in its discretion, permit an appeal to be taken from such order, if \napplication is made to it within ten days after the entry of the order: Provided, \nhowever, That application for an appeal hereunder shall not stay proceedings in \n- 3 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 94     Filed 02/23/2006     Page 4 of 7 \nthe district court unless the district judge or the Court of Appeals or a judge \nthereof shall so order.  \n \n28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). \n  In order for the State defendants to petition for permission to appeal, this Court must \ncertify that:  (1) the order presents a controlling question of law, (2) there is a substantial ground \nfor a difference of opinion on the question, and (3) an immediate appeal and resolution of the \nquestion promises to materially speed up the litigation.  See Ahrenholz v. Board of Trustees of \nUniv. of Ill., 219 F.3d 674, 675 (7th Cir. 2000).  All criteria must be satisfied before a district \ncourt may certify its order.  See id. at 676. \n  “A controlling question of law must encompass at the very least every Order which, if \nerroneous, would be reversible error on final appeal.”  Katz v. Carte Blanche Corporation, \n496 F.2d 747, 755 (3rd Cir. 1974).  The term is clearly not so limited, however, and has long \nbeen construed to mean that the question must be “serious to the conduct of the litigation, either \npractically or legally.”  Id., quoted in Johnson v. Burken, 930 F.2d 1202, 1206 (7th Cir. 1991).  \n“A question of law may be deemed ‘controlling’ if its resolution is quite likely to affect the \nfurther course of the litigation, even if not certain to do so.”  Sokaogon Gaming Enterp. v. \nTushie-Montgomery Assoc., 86 F.3d 656, 659 (7th Cir. 1996) (citation omitted). \n  The State defendants respectfully submit that the February 7 Order plainly presents two \ncontrolling questions of law:  first, whether plaintiffs’ claims of future injury based on the \nclaimed inadequacy of the rates paid their long-term residential care providers are sufficiently \nripe  to  confer  standing;  and  secondly,  whether  plaintiffs  have  a  private  right  of  action  to \nchallenge the adequacy of the rates being paid to their providers based on 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and \n1396a(a)(30)(A).   By even the strictest standard, these two questions are “controlling” because, \n- 4 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 94     Filed 02/23/2006     Page 5 of 7 \nif this Court has decided them wrongly, the decision on either one would constitute reversible \nerror.  Katz, 496 F.2d at 755.  Clearly, whether the plaintiffs have standing to pursue their \nprospective claims and have a private right of action to attack the rates paid their providers under \nthe Medicaid Act are critical, both legally and practically, to the conduct of this litigation.  Cf. \nSokaogon Gaming Enterprise Corp., 86 F.3d at 659. \n  Secondly, there is substantial ground for difference of opinion on both the question of \nplaintiffs’  standing  and  on  whether  they  have  a  private  right  of  action  based  on \n§ 1396a(a)(30)(A).    On  the  issue  of  standing,  this  Court  concluded  that  the  prospect  that \nplaintiffs  might  have  to  move  from  one  community-based  residential  setting  to  another, \ncombined  with  the  possibility  that,  at  some  future  time,  they  might  suffer  “trauma  and \ndeterioration” constitute “a threat of injury that is real and immediate” (Order at 8).  Neither the \nplaintiffs nor the Court has cited any case with similar facts that supports the Court’s conclusion. \n The State defendants respectfully suggest that there is “substantial ground” for a difference of \nopinion on this point, given the requirements of settled precedent for establishing standing and \nripeness.  Cf. Tobin for Governor v. Illinois State Bd. of Elect., 268 F.3d 517, 527-28 (7th Cir. \n2001) (the “injury in fact” requirement requires plaintiffs to establish he or she is “immediately \nin danger of sustaining some direct injury”; speculation is insufficient).  \n  That  there  is  substantial  ground  for  difference  of  opinion  on  the  question  whether \nMedicaid recipients have a private right of action based on the § 1396a(a)(30)(A) is beyond \ndebate.  Although this Court relied primarily on the unreported decision of the Northern District \nof Illinois in Memisovski ex rel. Memisovski v. Maram, 2004 WL 1878332 (N.D. Ill. 2004), the \nSeventh Circuit has never directly ruled on this point.  See Methodist Hospitals, Inc. v Sullivan, \n91 F.3d 1026, 1029 (7th Cir. 1996) (holding that providers of medical care have a private right of \n- 5 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 94     Filed 02/23/2006     Page 6 of 7 \naction based on § 1396a(a)(30)(A)).  Methodist Hospitals is overdue for re-examination in light \nof Gonzaga University v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 279-86 (2002), however, and a growing number of \ncases decided since Gonzaga have now specifically held that § (a)(30)(A) does not confer a \nprivate  right  of  action  on either recipients or providers or both.  See Westside Mothers v. \nOlszewski.,  368  F.  Supp.  2d  740,  774  (E.D.  Mich.  2005)  (re-examining  prior  decisions \nrecognizing  private  right  in  light  of  Gonzaga;  finding  no  right  of  action  for  recipients); \nOklahoma  Chap.  of  Amer.  Aca.,  Pediat.  v.  Fogarty.,  366 F. Supp.  2d  1050,  1102-04 \n(N.D. Okla. 2005) (analyzing cases; holding that recipients but not providers have right of action \nunder  (a)(30)(A));  In  re.  NYAHSA  Litigation,  318 F.  Supp.  2d  30,  39-40  (N.D.N.Y.  2004) \n(recipients are intended beneficiaries; no private right of action for providers); Bio-Medical \nApplications of NC, Inc. v Electronic Data Systems Corp., __ F. Supp. 2d __, 2006 WL 270139 \n(E.D.N.C. 2006) (providers have no private right of action under (a)(30)(A)); Long Term Care \nPharmacy Alliance v. Ferguson, 362 F.3d 50, 56-59 (1st Cir. 2004) (re-examines prior precedent; \nheld: providers do not have private right of action, but rationale may affect recipients as well); \nSanchez v. Johnson, 416 F.3d 1051, 1062 (9th Cir. 2005) (holding that neither recipients nor \nproviders have private right of action under (a)(30)(A)). \n  Finally, an immediate appeal on the questions of standing and whether plaintiffs’ have a \nprivate right of action under § 1396a(a)(30)(A) promises materially to speed up the ultimate \ntermination of this litigation.  Reversal of the Court’s determination on the standing question \nwould conclude the case entirely, while resolution of whether plaintiffs have a private right of \naction under § 1396a(a)(30)(A) could substantially limit the scope of discovery, dispositive \nmotions and trial of the case.  Because the primary purpose of an interlocutory appeal pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) is that of materially advancing the ultimate termination of the litigation, see \n- 6 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 94     Filed 02/23/2006     Page 7 of 7 \nFisons Limited v. United States, 458 F.2d 1241, 1245 (7th Cir. 1972), the certification sought by \nthe State defendants motion is particularly appropriate in this case. \nCONCLUSION \n  For the reasons discussed above, the State defendants respectfully request certification \nfrom this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) to seek review by the court of appeals of the \ninterlocutory Order of February 7, 2006. \n  Dated this 23rd day of February, 2006. \n  PEGGY A.

They argue that the \nissues of whether Plaintiffs’ claims are sufficiently ripe to confer standing and whether there is a \nprivate  right of action under 42 U.S.C. § 1396a (a)(30)(A)  meet  the criteria for imm ediate \ninterlocutory appeal.  On March 1, 2006 the parties filed a stipulation agreeing to dismissal of the \nMedicaid  claim.  The rem aining  issue, stan ding,  does not justify interlocutory review.   \nAccordingly, this Court should deny the Defendan ts’ motion to certify that issue for appeal.   \nMoreover, Defendants’ motion for stay pending appeal should be denied in any case because the \npotential for harm to Plaintiffs and others is too significant to delay progress of this litigation. \n \n \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 103     Filed 03/16/2006     Page 2 of 9 \nARGUMENT \nI.  The  Motion for Certification sh ould  be  denied because the iss ue  of w hether \nPlaintiffs'  claims are   sufficiently ripe  to  confer standing does not meet the  \nprerequisites for a discretionary appeal.   \n \nTo justify certification of an issue for permissive interlocutory appeal, a defendant must \nshow that “exceptional circumstances justify a departure from the policy of postponing appellate \nreview until after the en try of a final judgm ent.” Shepherd Investments International, Ltd. v. \nVerizon Communications, Inc., No. 03-C-0703, 2005 WL 1475323, *1 (E.D. Wis. June 22, 2005) \nquoting Fisons Ltd. v. United States , 458 F.2d 1241, 1248 (7th Cir. 1972);  see also Herdrich v. \nPegram, 154 F.3d 362, 368 (7th Cir. 1998)  (stating that “[c]ertificates of appealability are \ngenerally disfavored . . .”).  Specifically, defenda nts must show that: (1) there is a question of  \nlaw; (2) it is controllin g; (3) the issue is contestable in  that there is substantial ground for \ndifference of opinion; and (4) its resolution will promise to speed up the litigation.  Ahrenholz v. \nBoard of Trustees of U niv. of Ill.,  219 F.3d 674, 675 (7th Cir. 2000);  Shepherd Investments \nInternational, Ltd., supra.  “Unless all these criteria are satisfied, the district court may not and \nshould not certify its order . . . for an  immediate appeal under section 1292(b).” Ahrenholz, 219 \nF.3d at 675 (emphasis original). The question of whether Plaintiffs’ claims are sufficiently ripe to \nconfer standing does not meet all of these factors.   \nA.  The standing issue is not a proper question of law for certification.   \nAs the Seventh Circuit has emphasized, “a question of law, as used in section 1292(b) has \nreference to . . . the meaning of a statutory or constitutional provision, regulation, or common \nlaw doctrine . . .” Ahrenholz at 676; see also Boim v. Quranic Literacy Inst., 291 F.3d 1000, 1007 \n(7th  Cir. 2002).  It should be “free f rom a factual context” and “something the court of appeals \ncould decide quickly and cleanly w ithout having to study the record.”  Ahrenholz at 677.   See \n  2\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 103     Filed 03/16/2006     Page 3 of 9 \nalso, e.g., Boim,  291 F.3d at 1007 (certifying questions of  interpretation of federal statutes, \nspecifically: (1) whether funding an  international terrorist organi zation is an act of terrorism \nunder 18 U.S.C. § 2331; (2) wheth er 18 U.S.C. § 2333 inco rporates the definitions of terrorism \nfound  in other statutes; and (3 )  whether a civil cause of ac tion  for aiding and abetting \ninternational terrorism lies under these statutes.); U.S. EEOC v. Sidley, Austin, Brown & Wood, \n406 F. Supp. 2d 991, 993 (N.D. Ill. 2005) (certif ying the “purely legal” question of whether the \nEEOC may pursue claims on behalf of individuals who failed to file charges under the ADEA).   \nIn this case, a determ ination of whether Pl aintiffs have standing involves m ore than a \nclean interpretation of the m eaning of a statutory, constitutiona l or regulatory provision or \ncommon-law doctrine. The questio n is enmeshed in the factual context.  This Court based its  \ndetermination that Plaintiffs have standing on its  evaluation of a num ber of factual allegations, \nincluding allegations that family care service providers would withdraw from the program unless \nreimbursement rates were increased, Plaintiffs w ould suffer trauma as a result, th at the State \nDefendants control the rates of reimbursement and that an increase in the rates would mean that \nproviders would not leave the program. Nelson v. Milwaukee County, 2006 WL 290510, *3 (E.D. \nWis. 2006).  Thus, if the Court of Appeals were  to evaluate this Court’s determination it would \nbe required to engage in a detailed analysis of the many factual allegations rather than a “quick \nand clean” analysis of a  strictly legal question. See JAMES WM. MOORE, MOORE’S FEDERAL \nPRACTICE § 101.81 (3d Ed. 2005) (noting that the determination of ripeness is frequently difficult \nbecause it “necessarily includes a num ber of complex issues to be resolved [including] whether  \nsufficient facts are established or whether the matter is too abstract [or] whether harm is likely to \noccur . . .”).  Defendants have failed to meet their burden of establishing this factor. \n \n  3\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 103     Filed 03/16/2006     Page 4 of 9 \nB.

To satisfy the requ irement that an issue be contestable, “it is no t \nenough  that there be a differenc e  of opinion, there m ust  be  a  substantial ground for such \ndifference.” Shepherd Investments, at *2.  Far from meeting that standard, Defendants have not \nidentified any opinion or other au thority that actually conflicts with this Court’s decision.  The  \nonly case that Defendants cite,  Tobin for Governor v. Illinois State Bd. of Elec.,  268 F.3d 517 \n(7th Cir. 2001), presents no conflict.  The  Tobin court found that the plaintiffs’ claims that their \nconstitutional rights had been  violated in connection with an electio n were moot because the \nelection had already taken place. Id. at 528.  It also found that they  lacked standing to complain \nof the same injury occurring in the future because at least four unlikely contingencies had to \noccur for the injury to be replicated.1  In the instant case, Plaintiffs have alleged - and presented \nevidence - that their injury is imminent because their service providers will withdraw if the rates \nare not increased.  In  contrast to Tobin, plaintiffs have shown that  this single contingency is \nhighly likely to occur.  \nDefendant argues that neither the Court nor Pl aintiffs cited any cases with sim ilar facts \nsupporting the Court’s conclusion that  standing exists. Brief, at 5.  This is inaccurate.  As just \none example, Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154 (1997), cited in the Court’s opinion, fully supports \nits conclusion. 2006 WL 290510 at *4. The  Bennett plaintiffs alleged that a d irective from the \ndefendant U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service would cause the Bureau of Reclamation, a non-party, \n                                                 \n1 The same candidates would have to decide to run fo r office, more than 25,000 signatures in support of \nthose candidates would have to be collected, those signatures would need to be determined sufficient by a \nhearing officer, and the elections board would have  to reverse the hearing officer and issue a written  \nopinion with identical objections.  Tobin, at 528. \n  4\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 103     Filed 03/16/2006     Page 5 of 9 \nto take actions that would inju re the plaintiffs.  Similarly, Plaintiffs in this cas e allege that \nDefendants’ actions will cause providers, non-parties,  to take actions that  will injure Plaintiffs.  \nThe Supreme Court in  Bennett held unanimously that the plaintiffs had standing, noting that a  \ndefendant’s actions need not be the last step in  a chain of causation to be fairly trac eable to the \ninjury. Id. at 169.  The same principle applies in this case. \nEven if Defendants had shown a lack of pr ecedent, it would be imm aterial. A showing \nthat there are substantial grounds for difference of opinion cannot be satisfied merely by showing \nlack of judicial precedent; rather , \"the moving party must still show that there is a substantial \nlikelihood that the district court ruling will be reversed on appeal.\" Boese v. Paramount Pictures \nCorp., 952 F.Supp. at 560-1; Hollinger v. In re Bridgestone/Firestone, 212 F. Supp. 2d 903, 909 \n(S.D.  Ind. 2002) (holding that  movant  must  show \"substant ial  conflicting p ositions\").2  \nMoreover, any lack of identical cases is simply indicative of the individualized nature of ripeness \ndecisions, which are: \n. . . often  sui generis. Most litigation has idiosyncratic features and the various \nintegers that enter into the ripeness equation play out quite differently from  case \nto case, thus influencing the bottom line. \n \nErnst & Young v. Depositors Economic Protection Corp. , 45 F.3d 530, 536 (1st Cir. 1995);  see \nalso MOORE’S FEDERAL PRACTICE § 101.81.  Thus, a rule requiring that the non-moving party or \ncourt cite a case based on identical facts reaching the same conclusion before denying a request \n                                                 \n2 A district court will be affirmed on any additional ground that is supported by the record and has not \nbeen waived. Crane v. Indiana High School Athletic Assn., 975 F.2d 1315, 1319 (7th Cir. 1992). The \nCourt found no need to reach Plaintiffs' supplemental arguments about the essential nature of group home \nliving for people with disabilities, Oconomowoc Residential Programs, Inc. v. City of M ilwaukee, 300 \nF.3d 775, 787 (7th Cir. 2002), or the significant interest in continuing existing relationships with staff and \nother residents under the Supreme Court's association cases, Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. \n609, 620 (1984); Bd. of Dir. of Rotary International v. Rotary Club of Duarte, 481 U.S. 537, 545 (1987). \nThese  arguments  would,  however,  provide  yet  another  basis for affir ming  the Court's decision on \nstanding.  \n \n  5\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 103     Filed 03/16/2006     Page 6 of 9 \nfor interlocutory appeal would  result in nearly all ripeness de terminations being appealable, \nwhich would run counter to the caution of  Ahrenholz and the intent of  §1292(b).  Defendant s \nhave not met their burden with regard to this criterion. \nC.  Granting an appeal on this issue is highly unlikely to expedite the litigation.  \nThe Seventh Circuit denies m ost §1292(b) requests, thus, Defendants must dem onstrate \nsomething extraordinary to justify the obvious delays that result from simply making the motion. \nAhrenholz, 219 F.3d at 675. The law “does not contem plate that an imm ediate appeal [be \nallowed] solely on the ground that [it] may advance the proceedings in the district court.”   Id. at \n676 (citation omitted); see also Genentech, Inc. v. Novo Nordisk A/S , 907 F.Supp. 97, 100 \n(S.D.N.Y.  1995) (certification \"m ust  materially  advance\" the lit igation)  (citations  omitted).  \n“Special care must be taken to avoid the risk  that a § 1292 appeal m ay actually impede, rather \nthan expedite the conclusion of the entire case.”  Fisons, 458 F.2d  at 1248. \nThis case does not involve a dispute over historical events. Rather, the operation of the \nFamily Care program is ongoing and impacts the Plaintiffs in a very personal way. Milwaukee \nCounty received a large increase in the capitate d rate for calendar year 2005 com pared to 2004. \nwww.dhfs.state.wi.us/LTCare/StateFedReqs/CaptitatedRates.htm.  County staff announced at \nprovider meetings in early 2005 that a new reside ntial rate structure was being developed. [Dkt . \n53-SRCA Memo, at 6-7 & 13-14]. Then it was learned that those additional funds would first be \nused  to repay previous shortfalls instead of  allocating  at  least som e  portion to   residential \nproviders immediately. [Dkt. 79- Cook Aff. ¶49 & Ex. I].  There was still hope for increased \nresidential rates, but it now a ppears that the funding situation  has gotten even worse and that \nresidential providers will not be receiving any increases at all.  \n  6\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 103     Filed 03/16/2006     Page 7 of 9 \nMilwaukee County expected an additional $3.7 million annual increase for 2006 and had \nalready committed it to another class of providers rather than to residential services. Family Care \nfaces  $1.8 m illion  shortfall,  Milwaukee Journal Sentinel,  January  22, 2006. Unfortunately, \nhowever, the County did not recei ve any annual capitated rate  increase for 2006 and providers \nare \"hurting.\" Id.  This latest failure to increase rates is likely to push more providers over the \nedge. Thus, the likelihood that th e Plaintiffs and othe r AFH/CBRF residents w ill be forced to \nmove is greater now than at any other tim e since this case was filed. That, in turn, threatens the \ninterim agreement that resolved the original preliminary injunction motion. [Dkt. 20-Transcript \nof Agreement]. \n The  issues in this case cannot be put  on  a shelf during an interlocutory appeal. \nAdministrative efficiency will be best served by deciding the pending class motion and resolving \nthe entire case as soon  as practical, rather th an focusing on a single issu e. Certification under \n§1292(b) will not expedite the litigation.    \nD.  Whether this issue is controlling is immaterial. \nThe standing issue may be controlling, however, satisfaction of that factor alone cannot  \njustify  granting interlocutory appeal.  Shepherd  Investments,  supra.  Otherwise interlocutory \nappeals would be granted routinely rather than as extraordinary relief.   \nII.  The proceedings should not be stayed pending the reso lution of the request for an  \n  interlocutory appeal. \n \nThe State Defendants have also m oved for a st ay of further proceed ings in this matter \npending the interlocutory appeal.  A stay pending application for an interlocutory appeal requires \na separate determination and order.  28 U.S.C. § 1292(b).  \"Congress could have required but did \nnot require the granting of perm ission for interlocutory appeal  to be accompanied always by a \nstay of the lower court proceed ings.\" Reed v. Rhodes, 549 F.2d 1050, 1052 (6th  Cir. 1976).  It \n  7\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 103     Filed 03/16/2006     Page 8 of 9 \nshould be denied if \"potential harm to plaintiffs .  .  . outweighs any bene fit that may be gained \nby awaiting the Court of Appeals' decision.\" Powell v. National Football League , 711 F.Supp. \n959, 961 (D. Minn. 1989).  The district court in  Powell certified issues for an interlocutory \nappeal but denied the  stay and ruled on additional motions including class certification. Id. at \n967.  Because a §1292(b) appeal m ay prolong litigation, “a stay of proceedings in the dis trict \ncourt pending an appeal . . . will seldom if ever be granted.”  Fisons, 458 F.2d at 1248, n. 16.  \nIn Reed, a school desegregation class  action, the district court had certified the case for  \ninterlocutory appeal and stayed all further proceedings. The Sixth Circuit, however, dissolved the \nstay  because  the v alue  of  the c onstitutional  interests  at  stake ou tweighed  the  potential \nadministrative inconvenience to the district court if its efforts in form ulating a remedy were \nundone by a reversal on the m erits.  549 F.2d at 1052,  citing Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg \nBoard of Education, 399 U.S. 926 (1970). Like the Reed and Swann cases, the potential harm in \ndelaying further proceedings here far outweighs any administrative burden. As discussed above, \nthe plight of the individual Plain tiffs is getting worse along with the magnitude of the rate \ndispute.  The issues are system ic  so it is  appropriate  to proceed with the class m otion. \nAccordingly, regardless of this  Court’s ruling on the certifica tion question, it should deny the \nstay motion. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court deny the motion \nto certify issues for interlocutory appeal and the motion for a stay. \n \n   \n  8\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 103     Filed 03/16/2006     Page 9 of 9 \nDate: March 16, 2006  \n \n     Respectf ully submitted, \n \n      ATTORNEYS FOR THE PLAINTIFFS \n \n          s/ Robert Theine Pledl \n       _______________________________________ \n       W isconsin State Bar No. 1007710 \n       1110  N.

On February 7, 2006, t he Court issued a decision resolving the State' s motion to \ndismiss and the County's motion for judgment on the pleadings. Most of the claims were allowed \nto proceed, but the Court did so me pruning. Plaintiffs are now fu rther simplifying the case by \nagreeing to dismiss the Medicaid claim. (A stipulation to that ef fect is being f iled with the \nCourt.) The legal issues have been clarified a nd it is time to address the question of class  \ncertification.  Plaintiffs  submit  that there are  substantial  common questi ons  of law and fact  \nconcerning funding for group hom e services in Milwaukee County and that this case m eets all \nother criteria for certification under Rule 23, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n                                                 \n1 Gerald Nelson passed away on February 6, 2006 at St. Luke's Hospital. He was there for about a month and never \nrecovered from gall bladder surgery. His status as a plaintiff is being addressed by a separate submission. The Court \nmay decide to remove Mr. Nelson's name from the caption and \"promote\" Ms. Bzdawka. Or the Court can simply \nleave Mr. Nelson listed as the lead plaintiff. See Henrietta D. v. Gulliani, 1996 WL 633382 (E.D.N.Y. 1996) (lead \nplaintiff died but remained on the caption).  \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 102     Filed 03/01/2006     Page 2 of 12 \nSTANDARD FOR GRANTING CLASS CERTIFICATION \n  \"[O]f necessity\" the c lass certification process is \"not accom panied by the traditional \nrules and procedures applicable to civil trials.\" Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 477 U.S. 156, 178 \n(1974). In general, courts do not have \"any aut hority to conduct a prelim inary inquiry into the \nmerits of a suit in order to determine whether it may be maintained as a class action.\" Eisen, 417 \nU.S. at 178. The criteria for class certification are as follows: \nOne or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on \nbehalf of all only if (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpracticable, (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class, (3) the \nclaims  or d efenses  of the rep resentative  parties are typical of the claim s  or \ndefenses of the class, and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately \nprotect the interests of the class. \n   \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). There is also an implied requirement that the class be identifiable. Clarke v. \nFord Motor Co., 220 F.R.D. 568, 576 (E.D. Wis. 2004). If all of these criteria are satisfied, the court \nmust then determine whether the class fits into one of the categories in Rule 23(b). Id. at 579. \nARGUMENT \nI.  The proposed class is sufficiently definite and identifiable. \n  Plaintiffs seek certification of the following class: \nAll Milwaukee County residents with disa bilities who are now or w ill in the \nfuture be: (1) eligible for the Family Care program, and (2) appropriate, based on \nreasonable professional judgment, for residential services in adult family homes \nand community-based residential facilities. \n \n\"An identifiable class exists if its members can be ascertained by reference to objective criteria.\" \nGomez v. Illinois. State. Bd. of Educ., 117 F.R.D. 394, 397 (N.D. Ill. 1987); Clarke, 220 F.R.D. at \n576.  Plaintiff classes are often  defined  in reference to eligib ility  for specified governm ent \nprograms. Collins v. Hamilton, 349 F.3d 371, 372 n. 1 (7th Cir. 2003).  \n  2\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 102     Filed 03/01/2006     Page 3 of 12 \n  The eligibility element in the proposed definition here is objective and clearly meets the \nrequirement that the class be identifiable. The other element in the definition is appropriateness \nfor services provided in either AFHs or CBRFs based on reasonable professional judgment. The \nscope of these services is defined generally  by State statutes. Wis. Stat. §50.01(1)(a)1 & (1)(b) \n(AFH); Wis. Stat. §50.01(1g) (CBRF). The State  regulations contain more specific provisions \nregarding service provision in both types of residential facilities. Ch. HFS 82 and 88, Wis. Adm \nCode (AFH); Ch. HFS 83, Wis. Adm. Code (CBRF). The regulations thus provide a framework \nfor determining the type of indivi duals who are appropriate to live  there. That, in turn, defines \nthe class.  \n  The proposed definition ties class membership to evaluations and determinations that are \nalready being made on an ongoing basis by Family Care staff. Basing class membership on these \nfamiliar criteria results in an objective, definite and identifiable class definition. \nII.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical. \n  The numerosity requirement of Rule 23(a) is satisfied where joinder of the individual \nmembers will be difficult or impractical; it need not be impossible. Clarke I, 220 F.R.D. at 578, \nciting Robidoux v. Celani, 987 F.2d 931, 935 (2d Cir. 1993). A reas onable estimate of class size \nis sufficient. Leist v. Shawano County, 91 F.R.D. 64, 67 (E.D. Wis. 1981). A potential class size \nof forty or more is generally  sufficient to support certification.  Clarke I, supra.; Consol. Rail \nCorp. v. Town of Hyde Park, 47 F.3d 473, 483 (2d Cir. 1995). \n  Joinder may also be impractical for reasons other that sheer numbers. \"Inclusion of future \nclass members makes joinder impractical regardless of the number of persons already injured.\" \nElliott v. Chicago Housing Authority, 2000 WL 263730, *7 ((N.D. Ill. 2000) (citations omitted). \nThis is common in public benefit cases where \"the  membership of the class is regularly shifting \n  3\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 102     Filed 03/01/2006     Page 4 of 12 \nas new applicants are granted benefits . . . and ot hers leave the rolls.\" Raymond v. Rowland, 200 \nF.R.D. 173, 179 (D. Conn. 2004). Characteristics of  the class m embers may also be relevant. \nDisability is a factor. Mississippi Protection and Advocacy v. Cotten , 929 F.2d 1054, 1057 (5th \nCir. 1991) (\"no patient of the Center is likely to be capable of representing himself in this or any \nother court.\"). Financial st atus is another factor.  M.A.C. v. Betit, 284 F.Supp.2d 1298, 1303 \n(D.Utah 2003) (Medicaid clients \"by definition lack the financial resources [to file] on their own.\").  \n  The class consists of more  than 1,000 individuals. It is  undisputed that approximately \n1,080  current class m embers  reside in AFHs   and CBRFs funded through the F amily  Care \nprogram. [Factual stipulation in connection with plaintiffs' motion for class certification: ¶1 - 100 \nAFH clients and 980 CBRF clients].2 Moreover, the entire Family Care program currently serves \nabout 5,800 Milwaukee County residents. [Factual  stipulation: ¶2]. Many of the approxim ately \n4,700 Family Care members who are not currently in an AFH/CBRF are part of the class because \nthey are now appropriate for AFH/CBRFs eve n though they are living so mewhere else. In \naddition,  many will b e  appropriate in the f uture.  Some will no   longer b e  able to liv e \nindependently as their needs increase. Others are now receiving more intensive services such as \nin nursing homes, but they will be able to live in  an AFH/CBRF in the future as their condition \nimproves or as community care providers adopt new care methods and technologies. This is an \nexample  of the shiftin g  membership  concept  common i n  public benefit cases.  Raymond  v. \nRowland, 200 F.R.D. at 179. \n  Yet more class members will be both eligible and appropriate at some point in the future. \nThe Milwaukee County Disability Services Division now has approximately 350 clients in AFHs \nand 400 in CBRFs.  [Factual stipulation: ¶3]. They are under 60 and are funded through the \n                                                 \n2 Plaintiffs are using approximate totals. Obviously, these numbers can be computed exactly, but only some time \nafter they have been reported, inputted into a data base and then verified. Given the size of the numbers here, an \napproximation of current totals should be sufficient.  \n  4\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 102     Filed 03/01/2006     Page 5 of 12 \nMedicaid waiver programs rather than Family Care. Id. They now live in AFH/CBRFs and it is \nreasonable to assume that most will be appropriate for this level of care when they reach age 60. \n  Finally,  there are unk nown  future class m embers.  Some  are future resid ents  of \nMilwaukee County. Some are living in the C ounty but have not yet becom e disabled, while \nothers have disabilities and live in the County, but have not yet become eligible for Family Care \nbecause they are over the financial asset lim it. All of these are future m embers of the proposed \nclass who cannot possibly be ascertained at this time. \n  The proposed class satisfies the first Rule 23( a) element based on sheer numbers. It also \nsatisfies other indicia of impracticality because it contains future members and is composed of \nindividuals who are unlikely to bring their own actions due to their disabilities and their financial \nsituation. Joinder of all class members is clearly impractical. \nIII.  There are questions of law and fact common to the class. \n \n  The second Rule 23(a) element is the existence of common questions of law and fact. The \ntest is satisfied by the presence of a single common legal or factual issue. Clarke I, 220 F.R.D. at \n578-9.  Class actions may be based on a common le gal issue affecting persons with disabilities \neven though the precise services delivered to e ach class member will vary based on individual \nneeds.  M.A.C.  v. Bettit,   284 F.Supp.2d at 1303 (Medicaid-funded services);  Bradley  v. \nHarrelson, 151 F.R.D. 422, 426 (M.D. Ala. 1993)  (prison mental health care); Armstead v. \nPingree,  629 F.Supp. 273, 278 (MD. Fla. 1986) (treat ment  conditions in state psychiatric \nhospitals); Association for Retarded Citizens of North Dakota v. Olson, 561 F.Supp. 473, 475 \n(D.N.D. 1983) (lack of community treatment and conditions in state facilities); Johnson v. Brelje, \n482 F.Supp. 121, 125 (N.D. Ill. 1979) (pass and releas e procedures at state  facility). The next \nsections discuss the specific legal and factual issues that are suitable for class treatment. \n  5\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 102     Filed 03/01/2006     Page 6 of 12 \n  A.  Plaintiffs' ADA and §504 claims raise common issues of law and fact. \n  The Court has ruled that the plaintiffs ha ve stated a claim  of discrimination under the \nADA and §504 in comparison to other Milwauk ee County residents with  lesser disabilities. \nNelson, *5 & n. 12. The Court perm itted the plaintiffs' claims to go forward under the effective \nprogram access and participation  provisions in 28 C.F.R. §35.130.  Nelson, *6, citing Henrietta \nD. v. Bloomberg, 331 F.3d 261, 274 (2d Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 936 (2004). It also \nallowed the plaintiffs' claims under the inte gration regulations: 28 C.F.R. §35.130(d) and 28 \nC.F.R. §41.51(d). Nelson, *6, citing  Bruggeman v. Blagojevich, 324 F.3d at 911;  Olmstead v. \nL.C., 527 U.S. 581, 597 (1999);  Radaszewski v. Maram, 383 F.3d 599, 608 (7th Cir. 2004). \nFinally,  the Court held that plaintiffs st ated  a claim   under the reasonable accomm odation \nprovisions. Nelson, *7 (citations omitted). These claim s are clearly suitable for class treatment. \nAs the District Court in  Henrietta D. put it, \"the unifying legal an d factual question is whether \ndefendants  violated their legal  obligation  to provide plaintiffs   with  meaningful  access, a s \nrequired by the ADA a nd the Rehabilitation Act, to  public assistance benefits and services.\" \n1996 WL 633382, *13 (E.D.N.Y. 1996). Add in the other legal claims and that is our case. \n  The complaint alleges wide-spread financial problems going beyond the named plaintiffs. \n[4th Amd. Cmplt. ¶57 - 64]. For example: \nThe failure to provide reasonable rates a nd cost of living rate  increases has and \nwill  cause  numerous  operators  of  adult f amily  homes,  community-based \nresidential facilities and day programs3 for persons in AFHs and CBRFs to either \ncut  the level of services they provid e  or refuse to se rve  Milwaukee County \nresidents with disabilities with the result that they will be forced to move from \n                                                 \n3 A brief explanation of the role of day programs is in order. Day programming can be part of the \"individual service \nplan\" for specific clients. §HFS 83.32(2)(a) and §HFS 83.33(2)(c). These clients leave the AFH/CBRF on a regular \nschedule during the week in order to attend work or activity programs. Not all AFH/CBRF residents attend day \nprograms. For those who do, it represents another potential loss: \"Clients develop attachments to the other clients \nand to particular staff members in their CBRF and at their day program.\" [Burr I Aff. ¶12]. Clients will lose contact \nwith their friends if a change in residence makes continued attendance at their day program impossible for \ngeographic or other reasons. Plaintiffs believe there is also a problem with day program rates. [Burr II Aff. ¶15].   \n  6\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 102     Filed 03/01/2006     Page 7 of 12 \ntheir homes and to lose their day services. This will cause substantial numbers of \nthese residents to be admitted to institutions such as nursing homes.  \n \n[4th Amd. Cmplt. ¶64]. Moreover: \nAll members of the proposed class are si milarly affected by the failure of DHFS \nand Secretary Nelson to provide an adequate capitated rate to Milwaukee County \nFamily Care and the failure of Milw aukee County to provide adequate paym ents \nto AFHs, and CBRFs and day programs for persons in AFHs and CBRFs. \n \n[Id. at ¶129]. \n  The sufficiency of the Family Care rates and the effect of those rates on the members of \nthe class are common issues of fact and they rela te to the common issues of law that the Court \nhas already identified. The proposed class satisfied Rule 23(a)(2). \nB.  The  defendants have asserted cl ass-based  defenses to the ADA and  \nRehabilitation Act claims. \n \n  The defendants have asserted a fundam ental alteration defense to plaintiffs'  ADA and \n§504 claims. [Dkt. #50: Stipulation regarding issues in dispute: defenses G & H]. This defense  \nmust be resolved in the aggregate rather than on an individual basis. Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 603-\n4. In applying the fundamental alteration defense, \"[a] court must therefore take care to consider \nthe cost of a plaintiff's care not in isolation, but in the context of the care [the State] must provide \nto all individuals with disabilities comparable to those of the plain tiff.\" Radszewski v. Maram, \n383 F.3d at 614. In other words, the needs of  other individuals who  require AFH/CBRF care \nmust be part of the reasonable  modification analysis. Since the comparable individuals are also \nmembers of the proposed class, this class-based defense presents additional common issues of \nlaw and fact that support the motion for certification. \nIV.  The claims of the named plaintiffs are typical of the class. \n \n  The third element is whether the claims of the proposed class representatives are typical \nof the claims of the class as a whole. Rule 23(a)(3 ). The requirements of commonality and \n  7\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 102     Filed 03/01/2006     Page 8 of 12 \ntypicality in Rule 23 \"tend to merge.\" General Telephone Co. of Southwest v. Falcon , 457 U.S. \n147, 157 n. 13 (1982). It is not a de manding requirement because it looks at th e essential \ncharacteristics of the claims rather than whether they are identical in all respects.  Clarke, supra. \n  There are five pairs of nam ed plaintiffs consisting of a Family Care member and their \nguardian or agent under a power of attorney. (The  allegations regarding  a sixth pair, Gerald \nNelson and his guardian, Jane Prentice, are being dismissed from the case due to his death.) The \ncomplaint alleges that they are  all facing exactly the sam e funding issues and threats of losing \ntheir current AFH/CBRFs as the rest of the class. The claims of the named plaintiffs are typical \nunder Rule 23(a)(3). \nV.  The representatives will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. \n \n  The fourth element is whether the named plaintiffs will be able to ad equately represent \nthe class. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  The class representatives may not have interests that conflict \nwith or are antagonistic to those of the class. East Tex. Motor Freight System, Inc. v. Rodriguez, \n431 U.S. 395, 403 (1977);  Clarke, 220 F.R.D. at 579. However, it is not necessary that their \ninterests be identical. Id. citing Edmondson v. Simon, 86 F.R.D. 375, 381 (N.D.Ill. 1980). This \nconflict analysis is conducted at the outset of the case when it is not known exactly which class \nmembers will receive a specific benefit or suffer a specific detriment. Uhl v. Thoroughbred \nTechnology and Telecommunications, Inc, 309 F.3d 978, 986 (7th Cir. 2002). \n  The individual plaintiffs are in AFHs and  CBRFs that are in financial difficulty because \nof the Family Care rate problem s that are the heart of this cas e. They all feel  strongly about \ngetting to the bottom of the funding issue and remaining in their current homes rather than face \nthe trauma of moving and probable deterioration. [4th Amd. Cmplt. ¶89-90, 99-100, 108-9, 118-\n119, 126-7]. Two of the  guardians submitted affidavits that show how strongly th ey feel about \n  8\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 102     Filed 03/01/2006     Page 9 of 12 \nthis. [Dkt. #12-Steeves Aff. ¶17-19]; [Dkt. #10-Miller Aff. ¶17]. Th is is not an abstract dispute \nfor the plaintiffs. They have every reason to litigate the case vigorously on behalf of the class. \nVI.  Plaintiffs' counsel will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class. \n   \n  The qualifications of class counsel had been treated as an element of the named plaintiffs' \nadequacy as class representatives. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4);  Clarke, supra. As amended in 2003, \nRule 23(g) continues the historical requirement that counsel \"fairly and adequately represent the \ninterests of the class.\" Rule 23(g)(1)(B). It also contains additional provisions: \n  In appointing class counsel, the court \n   (i)  must consider \n•the  work counsel has done in iden tifying  or investig ating  potential \nclaims in the action, \n•counsel's experience in handling class actions, other complex litigation, \nand claims of the type asserted in the action, \n•counsel's knowledge of the applicable law, and \n•the resources counsel will commit to representing the class; \n  (ii) may consider any other m atter pertinent to counsel's ability to fairly \nand adequately represent the interests of the class; \n(iii) may direct potential class co unsel to provide information on any \nsubject pertinent to the appointm ent and to propose term s for attorneys \nfees and nontaxable costs; and \n(iv) may make further orders in connection with the appointment. \n \nRule 23(g)(1)(C). The following sections will discuss these factors separately in regard to Atty. \nPledl and the National Health Law Program, Inc. All of the elements going to the adequacy of \ncounsels' representation have been satisfied. \n  A.  Atty. Robert Theine Pledl   \n  Atty.  Pledl has obtained and reviewed t housands  of pages of docum ents,  and has \nconsulted with numerous clients, potential clients, potential witnesses and experts to identify and \ninvestigate potential claims in the case. Consis tent with the trend to wards later certification \nmotions, counsel's efforts have significantly streamlined both the class motion and the ultim ate \npresentation of the merits. See Rule 23, A dvisory Committee Notes to the 2003 Am endments. \n  9\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 102     Filed 03/01/2006     Page 10 of 12 \n(\"discovery in aid of the certification decision also includes information required to identify the \nnature of the issues that actually will be presented at trial.\") Several experts have been evaluating \ndocuments and they have prepared reports and affidavits going to the merits of the case. Motions \non the pleadings have been fully briefed and de cided. The work already performed on this case \ndemonstrates Atty. Pledl's commitment. \n  A  curriculum  vitae  was attached   to the Seco nd  Pledl  Affidavit. [Dkt. 53]. He has \npreviously served as plaintiffs'  counsel in thre e certified class actions.  Atty. Pledl also has an \nextensive background in other litigation involving disability and civil rights issues.   \nB.  National Health Law Program, Inc. \n  Atty. Sarah Jane Somers and Atty. M. Jane Perkins of the National Health Law Program \nhave filed a notice of appearance and will be serving as co-counsel fo r the plaintiffs and the \nputative class. They have both filed Declarations setting out their background and qualifications \nin support of the class certification motion. The National Health Law Program is a non-profit law \nfirm specializing in health issues affecting low-income people and individuals with disabilities. \n  Atty. Somers is a staff attorney in the Program's Chapel Hill office. She has previou sly \nserved as counsel in several class actions including Dubois v. Medows, No. 4:03-cv-00107-SPM \n(N.D. Fla.); Ball v. Biedess, No. 4:00-cv-00067-EHC (D.Ar iz.) and Dunajski v. Keegan, No. \n3:99-cv-00353 (D.Ariz.). She has also written a number of manuals and articles on Medicaid and \nvarious health law topics. She is admitted to practice in the First, Third, Sixth and Ninth Circuit \nCourts of Appeal and several district courts. Sh e is in the process of applying for adm ission in \nthe Eastern District. \n  Atty. Perkins is the Program's Legal Director and is also located in the Chapel Hill office. \nShe has very extensive experience in class actio n litigation involving Medicaid, civil rights and \n  10\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 102     Filed 03/01/2006     Page 11 of 12 \nchildren's health. She h as also written extens ively on Medicaid and health care poverty law \ntopics. She is admitted to practice before the United States Supreme Court, the Third, Fourth, \nSixth, Eighth, Ninth, T enth and District of Columbia Courts of Appeals and various district  \ncourts. She is in the process of applying for admission in the Eastern District.   \nVII.  The proposed class action is maintainable under RULE 23(b)(2). \n  Once all of Rule 23(a) criteria have been m et, the next step is to determine whether the \nclass meets one of the subsections in Rule 23(b).  Clarke, 220 F.R.D. at 579. Rule 23(b)(2) \napplies to situations where the defendants \"acted or refused to act on grounds equally applicable \nto  the class \"  and plaintiffs  seeks declaratory  and  injunctive relief. Ca ses  alleging  systemic \nproblems  in government program s  are genera lly  appropriate for certification under R ule \n23(b)(2). Raymond v. Rowland, 220 F.R.D. at 181. This is just such a case. Any declaratory o r \ninjunctive relief will benefit the class as whole. Clarke, supra. The putativ e class action is \nmaintainable under Rule 23(b)(2). \n \nCONCLUSION\n  Plaintiffs have requested certification of a class based on the following definition: \nAll Milwaukee County residents with disa bilities who are now or w ill in the \nfuture be: (1) eligible for the Family Care program, and (2) appropriate, based on \nreasonable professional judgment, for residential services in adult family homes \nand community-based residential facilities. \n \nThe proposed class m eets all of the requirem ents of Rule 23. A class action will be the m ost \nefficient  means  of  resolving  the  issues  in  the  case.  The nam ed  plaintiffs  are  suitable \nrepresentatives and the undersigned have the necessary experience to serve as class counsel. It is \nrespectfully requested that the Court certify this class. \n \n  11\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 102     Filed 03/01/2006     Page 12 of 12 \nDate: March 1, 2006   \n     Respectf ully submitted, \n \n      ATTORNEYS FOR THE PLAINTIFFS \n \n          s/ Robert Theine Pledl \n       _______________________________________ \n       W isconsin State Bar No. 1007710 \n       1110  N.

The \nplaintiffs  allege  that  the  policies  and  practices of the program discriminate against \neligible individuals in several ways. The program funds community services for persons \n60 years of age and older at a lower rate than similar services provided to persons with \nsimilar disabilities who are under  the age of 60. The program also fails to provide \nadequate services based on the individual's needs and limits the choice of provider, \nagain in comparison to similar persons under the age of 60. The failure to provide \nadequate services creates a substantial likelihood that persons covered by Family Care \n   \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 02/25/04   Page 5 of 20   Document 1-2 \n\nwill  be  unable  to  remain  in  the  community  and  will  be  moved  to  more  restrictive \ninstitutional settings. The named plaintiffs bring these claims on their own behalf and \nalso seek to represent a class defined as follows: \nAll Milwaukee County residents who now qualify or who will in the future \nqualify for services through the Family Care program.  \n \nIt is the position of the plaintiffs that Milwaukee County's application of discriminatory \npolicies and practice to  Family Care clients has and will violate their rights to equal \nprotection under the United States and Wisconsin Constitutions and their rights under \nthe Wisconsin Patients Bill of Rights, the Americans with Disabilities Act and §504 of the \nRehabilitation Act.   \nPARTIES \n(2)  Plaintiff Gerald N. is an adult resident of Milwaukee County. He is 71 \nyears old. The Milwaukee County Probate Court entered an order for guardianship of \nthe person on July 30, 1993 and an order for protective placement on March 28, 1994. \nThe guardian has retained the undersigned to serve as Gerald N.'s counsel herein and \na  petition  to  appoint  the  guardian  as  guardian  ad  litem  pursuant  to  Wis.  Stat., \n§803.01(3)  will  be  filed  with  the  Court.  All  of  the  court  records  and  information \nconcerning  Gerald  N.'s  disability  and  disability  services  that  he  has  received  from \nMilwaukee  County  are  confidential  pursuant  to  Wis.  Stat.,  §§51.30,  51.61(1)(n), \n55.06(17), 55.07(1) and 880.33(6). County staff will be able to identify Gerald N. from \nthe facts contained in this complaint based on their dealings with the plaintiff.  \n(3)  Plaintiff Joan B. is an adult resident of Milwaukee County. She is 67 years \nold. The Dane County Probate Court entered an order for guardianship and protective \n   \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 02/25/04   Page 6 of 20   Document 1-2 \n\nplacement on October 28, 1982. The Milwaukee County Probate Court entered an order \non June 7, 1988 naming the current guardian as successor guardian of the person. The \nguardian has retained the undersigned to serve as Joan B.'s counsel herein and a \npetition to appoint the guardian as guardian ad litem pursuant to Wis. Stat., §803.01(3) \nwill be filed with the Court. All of the court records and information concerning Joan B.'s \ndisability  and  disability  services  that  she  has  received  from  Milwaukee  County  are \nconfidential  pursuant  to  Wis.  Stat.,  §§51.30,  51.61(1)(n),  55.06(17),  55.07(1)  and \n880.33(6). County staff will be able to identify Joan B. from the facts contained in this \ncomplaint based on their dealings with the plaintiff. \n(4)  Defendant Milwaukee County is a municipal corporation with its principal \nplace  of  business  located  at  901  North  9th  Street,  City  and  County  of  Milwaukee, \nWisconsin. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nServices for Persons with Disabilities \n(5)  Certain persons with disabilities such as developmental disabilities, mental \nillness,  brain  injury,  Alzheimers,  physical  disabilities,  etc.  are  unable  to  live \nindependently  in  a  single-family  home  or  an  apartment.  (Others  with  these  same \ndisabilities are able to live independently based upon their individual skills.) Many of the \npersons with disabilities who are unable to live independently reside with their families. \nMany adults with disabilities continue to live with their aging parents until the death or \nillness of the caregivers makes that impossible. \n(6)  The total number of persons with disabilities is increasing due to medical \nadvances  that  save  the  lives  of  medically  fragile  infants  and  persons  injured  in \naccidents.  Also,  as  life  expectancy  increases  generally,  persons  who  already  have \ndisabilities are living longer and the number of persons with disabilities associated with \nthe aging process is increasing along with the absolute number of elderly persons.    \n(7)  Historically, most persons with disabilities were placed in nursing homes \nand other large custodial institutions if their families were not able to provide suitable \ncare. Most of this institutional care is and has been funded through the federal Medicaid \nprogram. This reliance on institutions to provide residential care has changed over time. \n   \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 02/25/04   Page 7 of 20   Document 1-2 \n\nIn 1981, Federal law was changed to permit States to utilize Medicaid funding to pay for \ncommunity care. \n(8)  In  Wisconsin,  Medicaid  funding  channeled  through  the  Community \nOptions Program (COP), Community Integration Program (CIP), Brain Injury Waiver \n(BIW)  and  Family  Care  is  used  to  pay  for  most  community  care  for  persons  with \ndisabilities including both residential and day program services. The policies of these \nprograms contain a preference for smaller community residences and for community \nservices selected by the individual and/or the legal guardian.  \n(9)  Persons with disabilities may receive care provided in their own home by \noutside caregivers. They may also receive care in adult family homes (AFHs), which are \ncertified or licensed facilities for one to four persons, and community-based residential \nfacilities (CBRFs), which are licensed facilities for five or more persons. AFHs and \nCBRFs are either licensed or certified pursuant Wisconsin statutes and regulations \npromulgated by the Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services. \n(10)  Many persons with disabilities who receive residential services also attend \nday programs. These are programs that provide educational services, assistance with \nand  training  in  activities  of  daily  living  and  recreational  activities.  Day  programs \nfrequently  include  opportunities  for  participants  to  engage  in  community  activities \nranging from shopping to attending sports events other recreational activities. A day \nprogram may also include a vocational component.    \n(11)  Individuals with disabilities and/or their guardians choose particular day \nprograms and places to live for a variety of reasons. The reasons include the availability \nof specific disability services, appearance and layout, personal preferences regarding \nstaff and other participants or residents, access to public or specialized transportation, \nproximity  to  churches,  proximity  to  stores,  proximity  to  recreational  facilities, \naccessibility to work opportunities or vocational services, neighborhood characteristics, \nand closeness to friends and relatives. \nMilwaukee County Services for Persons with Disabilities \n(12)  Wis. Stat., §§46.215, 51.42 and 51.437 require each county in Wisconsin \nto provide specified services to persons with disabilities. \n(13)  Wis. Stat., §51.61 require counties, as well as other persons and entities \nproviding  services  to  persons  with  disabilities,  to  observe  certain  rights  that  are \nguaranteed to persons with mental illness, developmental disabilities, alcoholism or \ndrug dependency. \n   \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 02/25/04   Page 8 of 20   Document 1-2 \n\n(14)  Wis.  Stat.,  §§55.06  and  55.07  require  counties  to  follow  certain \nprocedures and observe certain rights that are applicable to persons who meet the \ncriteria for protective placement.  \n(15)  Services for persons with disabilities under the age of 60 in Milwaukee \nCounty are provided through the Milwaukee County Department of Human Services - \nDisability Services Division (DSD). It was formerly known as the Adult Services Division. \n(16)  Under DSD's policies and procedures, Milwaukee County residents with \ndisabilities under the age of 60, or their guardians if appropriate, are permitted to select \nand approve specific day programs and residential settings. \n(17)  Under DSD's policies and procedures, Milwaukee County residents with \ndisabilities under the age of 60 have not been removed from day and/or residential \nprograms over their own objections or over the objection of their guardians. \n(18)  Under DSD's policies and procedures, day and residential providers are \npermitted to request rate increases from DSD for serving Milwaukee County residents \nwith disabilities under the age of 60. \n(19)  Under DSD's policies and procedures, day and residential providers have \nreceived  cost  of  living  rate  increases  for  serving  Milwaukee  County  residents  with \ndisabilities under the age of 60.  \n(20)  Services for persons with disabilities in Milwaukee County who are 60 \nyears of age and older are provided through the Milwaukee County Department on \nAging (DOA). \n   \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 02/25/04   Page 9 of 20   Document 1-2 \n\n(21)  Milwaukee County DOA voluntarily requested to participate in Family Care \npursuant to Wis. Stat., §46.283. It was under no obligation to do so. \n(22)  Under DOA's policies and procedures, Milwaukee County residents with \ndisabilities 60 years of age and older, or their guardians if appropriate, are not permitted \nto select and approve specific day programs and residential settings. \n(23)  Under DOA's policies and procedures, Milwaukee County residents with \ndisabilities 60 years of age and older have been threatened with removal from day \nand/or residential programs over their own objections or over the objection of their \nguardians. \n(24)  Under DOA's policies and procedures, day and residential providers are \nnot  permitted  to  request  rate  increases  from  DOA  for  serving  Milwaukee  County \nresidents disabilities 60 years of age and older. \n(25)  Under DOA's policies and procedures, day and residential providers have \nnot received cost of living rate increases for serving Milwaukee County residents with \ndisabilities 60 years of age and older since the County's involvement in Family Care. \n(26)  The failure to provide reasonable cost of living rate increases has and will \ncause day and residential providers to either cut the level of services or refuse to serve \nMilwaukee County residents with disabilities and this will cause substantial numbers of \nthese residents to deteriorate and be admitted to institutions such as nursing homes.   \nGerald N. \n  (27)  Gerald N. has a developmental disability and a physical disability. \n   \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 02/25/04   Page 10 of 20   Document 1-2 \n\n  (28)  Gerald N. resided in his family's home until his mother became too ill to \ncare for him in November of 1998. Milwaukee County then placed him temporarily in a \nCBRF operated by Homes for Independent Living located in Menomonee Falls.  \n(29)  Shortly before his mother's death in January of 1999, Milwaukee County \nplaced the subject at Whitnall House, a CBRF operated by HIL in Hales Corners. He \nalso began to receive day program services at Paragon Industries which is associated \nwith HIL. \n(30)  Gerald N.'s guardian approved of his admission to Whitnall House and the \nParagon day program.  \n(31)  It is the guardian's continued desire that Gerald N. remain at Whitnall \nHouse and Paragon.  \n(32)  Milwaukee County filed Watts reports with the Milwaukee County Probate \nCourt on October 8, 1999, November 6, 2000, December 12, 2001 and October 14, \n2002 stating that the subject's placement at Whitnall  House  was  appropriate  to  his \nneeds and recommending that his placement there continue. \n(33)  Gerald N. now receives and has received funding for his disability services \nfrom Family Care through Milwaukee County DOA. \n(34)  HIL attempted over the course of  several year to negotiate with DOA to \nobtain a higher daily rate to cover the increased cost of providing services to Gerald N. \nand other clients. (A letter from Lincoln Burr, HIL dated October 22, 2003 to Dennis \nRyan and a letter from Lincoln Burr dated December 11, 2003 to Meg Gleeson are \nattached to this complaint and incorporated here.) \n   \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 02/25/04   Page 11 of 20   Document 1-2 \n\n(35)  Milwaukee County DOA refused to approve a cost of living rate increase \nfor Gerald N. \n(36)  HIL has given notice that it will terminate its contract with DOA effective \nApril 1, 2004 due to the failure to grant any cost of living rate increases. \n(37)  HIL  will  continue  to  contract  with  DSD  to  serve  Milwaukee  County \nresidents with disabilities under the age of 60. \n(38)  HIL has notified DOA that it would prefer to continue serving Gerald N. \nand that the funding dispute with DOA is the only reason for the contract termination. \n(39)  DOA intends to move Gerald N. to a different CBRF and day program over \nthe guardian's objection. \n(40)  It would be very traumatic and harmful to Gerald N. to be forcibly removed \nfrom his home. \n(41)  Due to the severity of Gerald N.'s disabilities, it is likely that moving him \nwould  worsen  his  condition  and  lead  to  placement  in  a  nursing  home  or  similar \ninstitution.   \nJoan B. \n(42)  Joan B. has a developmental disability. \n  (43)  Joan B. resided in the community with her family until 1955. She was then \nplaced in the Milwaukee County Mental Health Complex until 1968 when she was \ntransferred to the Central Wisconsin Center for the Developmentally Disabled, another \nlarge institution.  \n   \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 02/25/04   Page 12 of 20   Document 1-2 \n\n(44)  Joan B. was transferred from Central Center in 1995 to a succession of \ncommunity based residential facilities (CBRFs) in Milwaukee County. She moved to \nVienna House in 1996 and Arbor House in 2000. Both houses are operated by HIL. She \nalso attends the Paragon day program. Each of the transfers to a CBRF and to the \nParagon program was with her guardian's approval. \n(45)  It is the guardian's continued desire that Joan B. remain at Arbor House \nand Paragon.  \n(46)  Milwaukee County filed Watts reports with the Milwaukee County Probate \nCourt on January 10, 1997, January 6, 1998, October 12, 1998, October 8, 1999, \nNovember 6, 2000, December 12, 2001, October 19, 2002 and July 23, 2003 stating \nthat Joan B.'s placement at Vienna House and Arbor House was appropriate to her \nneeds and recommending that her placement there continue. \n(47)  Joan B. now receives and has received funding for his disability services \nfrom Family Care through Milwaukee County DOA. \n(48)  HIL attempted over the course  of several year to negotiate with DOA to \nobtain a higher daily rate to cover the increased cost of providing services to Joan B. \nand other clients. (A letter from Lincoln Burr, HIL dated October 22, 2003 to Dennis \nRyan and a letter from Lincoln Burr dated  December 11, 2003 to Meg Gleeson are \nattached to this complaint and incorporated here.) \n(49)  Milwaukee County DOA refused to approve a cost of living rate increase \nfor Joan B. \n   \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 02/25/04   Page 13 of 20   Document 1-2 \n\n(50)  HIL has given notice that it will terminate its contract with DOA effective \nApril 1, 2004 due to the failure to grant any cost of living rate increases. \n(51)  HIL  will  continue  to  contract  with  DSD  to  serve  Milwaukee  County \nresidents with disabilities under the age of 60. \n(52)  HIL has notified DOA that it would prefer to continue serving Joan B. and \nthat the funding dispute is the only reason for the contract termination. \n(53)  DOA intends to move Joan B. to a different CBRF and day program over \nthe guardian's objection. \n(54)  It would be very traumatic and harmful to Joan B. to be forcibly removed \nfrom her home. \n(55)  Due to the severity of Joan B.'s disabilities, it is likely that moving her \nwould  worsen  her  condition  and  lead  to  placement  in  a  nursing  home  or  similar \ninstitution.   \n   \nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA   Filed 02/25/04   Page 14 of 20   Document 1-2 \n\nPutative Class Members \n(56)  Gerald N. and Joan B. bring this action on their own behalf and also seek \nto represent a class of Milwaukee County residents who now qualify or who will in the \nfuture qualify for services through the Family Care program. \n(57)  The number of persons with disabilities who are now or will in the future \nbe  affected  by  Family  Care  policies  and  procedures  is  very  large  and  it  would \nimpractical to bring them all before the Court. \n(58)  Each  year  additional  persons  with  disabilities  are  born  in  Milwaukee \nCounty, and each year additional persons without disabilities residing in Milwaukee \nCounty become disabled through accidents, injuries, disease and/or the progression of \nthe aging process. It would impossible to identify or bring these unidentified future \nmembers of the putative class before the Court.  \n(59)  Milwaukee  County  has  acted  or  refused  to  act  on  grounds  generally \napplicable  to  the  putative  class,  thereby  making  appropriate  preliminary  and  final \ninjunctive relief and/or declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole. \n(60)  The  requirements  of  Wis.  Stat.,  §803.08  are  met  in  that  the  question \nbefore the Court is one of a common or general interest of many persons, the affected \nparties are very numerous and it is impractical to bring them all before the Court.  \nLEGAL CLAIMS \nCount One: Wis.

R. Civ. P. 23 for an order certifying the following plaintiffs’ class: \nAll Milwaukee County residents with disabilities who now are or will in the \nfuture be:  (1) eligible for the Family Care program, and (2) appropriate, based on \nreasonable professional judgment, for residential services in adult family homes \n[“AFHs”] and community-based residential facilities [“CBRFs”]. \n \nRecord (“R”) 101 at 1. \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 114     Filed 05/26/2006     Page 2 of 26(cid:10)\nDefendants Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services (“DHFS”) and Helene \nNelson  (collectively  “the  State  defendants”)  submit  this  response  brief,  together  with  the \nAffidavits of Charles Jones (“Jones Aff.”), James Hennen (“Hennen Aff.”) and that of the State \ndefendants undersigned counsel, opposing plaintiffs’ motion. \nISSUES PRESENTED \n  1.

Have plaintiffs met their burden of establishing the required elements of \nRule 23(a), particularly numerosity and that they are capable of adequately representing the class \nthey seek to represent? \n  2.  Have  the  named  plaintiffs  established  that  they  satisfy  the  elements  of \nRule 23(b)(2) required for class certification? \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE AND OF THE FACTS \n  On February 7, 2006, this Court filed its Decision and Order granting in part and denying \nin part the defendants’ motions to dismiss the Fourth Amended Complaint (R. 86).  As a result of \nthe Court’s Decision and Order and plaintiffs’ subsequent voluntary dismissal pursuant to a \nstipulation of the parties of a claim based on the Medical Assistance statute, 42 U.S.C. Title XIX, \n§§ 1396, et seq., this case now consists of four paired claims for declaratory and injunctive relief \n- 2 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 114     Filed 05/26/2006     Page 3 of 26(cid:10)\nbased on the Americans With Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq., and § 504 of \nthe Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794. \n  There are now three remaining named plaintiffs who are representatives of the named \nclass, Joan Bzdawka, Sandra Ehrlichman and Marilyn Berdikoff, who appear by their guardians \nand next friends.  Each of these three named plaintiffs is a developmentally disabled person aged \n60 or over who is a recipient of Family Care, a managed care Medical Assistance (“MA”) waiver \nprogram.  These plaintiffs each reside in an AFH or CBRF and attend related day programs \noperated by Homes for Independent Living (“HIL”), a Family Care provider (see R. 51, Fourth \nAmended Complaint (“Am. Comp.”), ¶¶ 80, 82, 91, 93, 101 and 102; see also Hennen Aff., ¶ 4). \nTwo other plaintiffs listed as parties in the caption are no longer proper class representatives, \naccording to information discovered by the State defendants in preparing this brief.  Plaintiff \nLenore Czarnecki has died (Hennen Aff., ¶ 6).  In addition, plaintiff John Gorton now resides in a \nnursing home because his health has deteriorated and his medical needs require treatment in a \nskilled nursing facility (id.).  Czarnecki was, and Gorton is, a frail elderly individual and each \nformerly resided in CBRFs operated by Senior Residential Care of America, Inc. (“SRCA”), \nanother Family Care provider. \n  Family Care is currently operated by DHFS as a pilot program in five counties, including \nMilwaukee  County,  the  only  county  Family  Care  program  involved  in  this  lawsuit  (see \nExhibit 2004, filed with the State defendants’ Motion to Dismiss (R. 71)).  Under Family Care, \nelderly  persons  with  long-term  care  needs  and  adults  who  have  physical  or  developmental \ndisabilities may receive comprehensive community-based services (see gen. Exhibit 2001, filed \nwith the State defendants’ Motions to Dismiss (R. 71) and available on the DHFS website at \nhttp://dhfs.wisconsin.gov/LTCare/Genera/l/Index.htm).  In Milwaukee County, Family Care is \n- 3 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 114     Filed 05/26/2006     Page 4 of 26(cid:10)\navailable only for elderly individuals (60 years of age and older), including those with physical \ndisabilities and those with developmental disabilities (see Exhibit 2003-D(1), filed with the State \ndefendants’ Motion to Dismiss (R. 71)).1 \nAs limited by the Court’s February 7 Decision and Order, the Fourth Amended Complaint \nfocuses on the Family Care capitated rates paid by the State defendants to the Milwaukee County \nCare  Management  Organization  (“CMO”)  and  the  negotiated  rates  paid  by  the  Milwaukee \nCounty CMO to providers of AFH and CBRF residential and day services during the years 2004 \nand 2005 (see Fourth Amended Complaint at 13-14 (R. 51:2:13-14)).2  Claims for retroactive \nrelief and alleging discrimination on the basis of age and county of residence in the distribution \nof long term care benefits have been dismissed, leaving only multiple claims that the defendants \ndiscriminated against the named plaintiffs and the class they seek to represent on the basis of \ntheir disabilities in violation of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act. \nUnder the Family Care Program, DHFS pays each participating county’s CMO a monthly \ncapitated rate for each individual who enrolls in the program.  In exchange for that payment, the \nCMO  is  contractually  obligated  to  provide each Medicaid-eligible participant all Medicaid-\ncovered long term care services listed in the participant’s individualized service plan (“ISP”). \n                                                 \n  1A  more  detailed  description  of  the  Family  Care  program  is  included  in  the  State \nDefendants’ Brief-in-Chief in support of its Motions to Dismiss the Fourth Amended Complaint \n(R. 71:3-8). \n \n  2The Court dismissed all of plaintiffs’ claims for retroactive relief, thus eliminating all \nclaims during the period from CY 2000 through 2003 (R. 86:7-8, 22).  The original complaint \nwas filed in January 2004 (R. 1:2:1) and the Fourth Amended Complaint includes a claim \nexpressly challenging the adequacy of the 2005 rates paid by DHFS to the Milwaukee County \nCMO (R. 51:2:13-14). \n- 4 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 114     Filed 05/26/2006     Page 5 of 26(cid:10)\nSee Jones Aff., ¶ 3.  The Milwaukee County CMO is the Milwaukee County Department on \nAging. \nThe distinctive feature of the Family Care program, which distinguishes it from prior \nprograms to fund long term care for disabled persons, is that it is intended to serve all eligible \nindividuals on a managed care model.  The CMO must use the capitated rates received for each \nmember to purchase the most cost-effective care and treatment in order to meet the treatment \nneeds of all eligible individuals.  The CMO negotiates the rates it pays to individual providers. \nThe contracts between the CMO and providers renew automatically from year to year, but are \nsubject to mutual renegotiation by mutual consent of the parties.  See Hennen Aff., ¶ 3. \nAdditional facts will be discussed as necessary during the course of the argument below. \nARGUMENT \nI.  THE  NAMED  PLAINTIFFS  HAVE  FAILED  TO  ESTABLISH  THE \nIMPLIED AND EXPRESS REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTIFICATION \nOF THE PROPOSED CLASS PURSUANT TO RULE 23(A). \nA.  Plaintiffs  have  the  burden  of  establishing  each  of  the  required \nelements necessary to support their motion for class certification \nunder Rule 23. \nFederal R. Civ. P. 23 requires a two-step analysis to determine whether class certification \nis appropriate.  See Rosario v. Livaditis, 963 F.2d 1013, 1017 (7th. Cir. 1992).  First, Rule 23(a) \ncontains four express requirements, each of which is a prerequisite to class certification.  Clay v. \nAmerican Tobacco Co., 188 F.R.D. 483, 489 (S.D. Ill. 1999).  The failure to meet any one of \nthem precludes certification as a class.  Id.  The four requirements are:  (1) that the class is so \nnumerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there are questions of law or fact \ncommon to the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the \nclaims or defenses of the class; and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately \n- 5 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 114     Filed 05/26/2006     Page 6 of 26(cid:10)\nprotect the interests of the class.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  It is the moving party’s burden to \nestablish that each of the prerequisites of Rule 23 is satisfied.  General Telephone Co. of \nSouthwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 161 (1982). \nIn addition—and antecedent to—the express requirements of Rule 23(a) are two implicit \nrequirements: “that the plaintiffs and the class they seek to represent have standing;” and that the \nproposed class be identifiable, or that the proposed class definition be precise, objective and \npresently  ascertainable.    In  re  Copper  Antitrust  Litigation,  196  F.R.D.  348,  353 \n(W.D. Wis. 2000) (quoting and citing treatises). \n  If the threshold requirements of Rule 23(a) are met, plaintiffs must satisfy at least one of \nthe three subdivisions of Rule 23(b).  In re Copper, 196 F.R.D. at 353.  In this case, plaintiffs \nrely on Rule 23(b)(2) which requires a showing that “the party opposing the class has acted or \nrefused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final \ninjunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.”  Id. \nOnce the successive requirements for class certification are met, the decision whether or \nnot to certify the class is vested in the discretion of the district court.  Cf. Alliance to End \nRepression v. Rochford, 565 F.2d 975, 977 (7th Cir. 1977). \nB.  Class certification must be denied because the requested class is \nnot limited to persons who have standing to maintain this action on \ntheir own behalf. \nDecisions on class certification should not be conditioned upon the merits of a case.  See \nEisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 177-78 (1974).  Nonetheless, “[t]he determination \n- 6 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 114     Filed 05/26/2006     Page 7 of 26(cid:10)\nwhether to certify a class usually should be predicated on more information than the complaint \nitself affords.”  In re Copper, 196 F.R.D. at 353 (internal quotation omitted).  Thus, \n  [i]n evaluating a motion for class certification, it is sometimes necessary to \nprobe behind the pleadings to determine whether the interests of absent parties are \nfairly encompassed within the named [plaintiffs’] claims. . . . Indeed, to protect \nabsent class members and defendants, this Court has an affirmative obligation to \nresolv[e] factual and legal disputes that strongly influence the wisdom of class \ntreatment. . . . Thus, instead of assuming that whatever the plaintiffs allege is true, \nas it would in testing the legal sufficiency of a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), the \nCourt may look[ ] beneath the surface of [the] complaint to conduct the inquiries \nin [Rule 23] and exercise the discretion it confers. \n \nAbram v. United Parcel Service of America, Inc., 200 F.R.D. 424, 427 (E.D. Wis. 2001) (internal \nquotation marks and citations omitted; italics in original). \n  Before addressing the specific requirements of Rule 23 (a), two implied prerequisites to \nclass certification must be addressed.  See Clay, 188 F.R.D. at 490; Rochford, 565 F.2d at 977. \n“Implicit in Rule 23 is the requirement that the plaintiffs and the class they seek to represent have \nstanding.”    In  re  Copper,  196  F.R.D.  at  353.      “This  is  a  ‘threshold  requirement  for  the \nmaintenance of a federal class action and must be considered in addition to the requirements of \nRule 23.’” Id., quoting Rozema v. The Marshfield Clinic, 174 F.R.D. 425, 432 (W.D. Wis. 1997), \nand 7B Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller and Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and \nProcedure, § 1785.1 (2d ed. 1986), at 139. \n  “The definition of a class should not be so broad so as to include individuals who are \nwithout standing to maintain the action on their own behalf.”  Clay, 188 F.R.D. at 490.  “To have \nstanding to sue as a class representative, the plaintiff ‘must be part of the class and ‘possess the \nsame interest and suffer the same injury’ as the class members.’” Harriston v. Chicago Tribune \nCo., 992 F.2d 697, 703 (7th Cir. 1993), quoting East Texas Motor Freight System Inc. v. \n- 7 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 114     Filed 05/26/2006     Page 8 of 26(cid:10)\nRodriguez, 431 U.S. 395, 403 (1977) and Schlesinger v. Reservists Committee to Stop the War, \n418 U.S. 208, 216 (1974). \n  Plaintiffs’  brief  in  support  of  their  renewed  motion  for  class  certification  (“Brief”) \nadvances conclusory arguments that ignore the question of class standing generally and fail to \nrecognize the impact of this Court’s February 7, 2006, order recognizing the named plaintiffs’ \nlimited standing and construing their numerous ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims in such a \nway that they survived, at least in part, the defendants’ motions to dismiss.  Mere eligibility for \nFamily Care benefits alone is not sufficient to justify class standing, as plaintiffs seem to argue; \nin  addition,  plaintiffs  and  the  class  they  seek  to  represent  must  “suffer  the  same  injury.” \nSchlesinger, 418 U.S. at 216; Rodriguez, 431 U.S. at 403; Falcon, 457 U.S. at 156.  Apart from \nthe conclusory allegations of the Fourth Amended Complaint, which the Court must look behind \nto  evaluate  properly  the  request  for  class  certification,  the  record,  including  the  affidavits \nsubmitted in opposition to the request for class certification and attached discovery documents \nfrom plaintiffs themselves, demonstrates plainly that the broad class plaintiffs seek to represent is \nsimply not “suffer[ing] the same injury” the plaintiffs claim to suffer. \n  Plaintiffs themselves claim no present injury whatever, as this Court has recognized. \nEach is a Family Care recipient who claims no injury from their present residential placement or \nany of the other Family Care services they have continuously received for the past several years. \nThey concede that their current placements are fully integrated and the least restrictive possible \ngiven their acute physical and developmental limitations.  They have suffered no barriers to \ninitial eligibility nor do they allege any difficulty in securing appropriate long term care services \nin the first place. \n- 8 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 114     Filed 05/26/2006     Page 9 of 26(cid:10)\n  Instead, their eight variously stated claims under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act all boil \ndown to semantic variations on a single theme.  They claim that the capitated rates paid by DHFS \nto the Milwaukee CMO during calendar years (“CY”) 2004 and 2005 and, in turn, the rates the \nMilwaukee CMO contracted to pay their residential providers during the same period, were so \nlow that the providers will be forced to terminate their participation in Family Care, thereby \nforcing  plaintiffs  personally  to  move  involuntarily  to  a  different  residential  placement, \naccompanied,  as  this  Court  has  found,  by  real  and  immediate  “trauma  and  deterioration” \n(R. 86:8) and “forced . . . move[s] to an institutional setting” (R. 106:3).3 \n  Indeed, plaintiffs themselves have fully acknowledged that their numerous claims of \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability focus exclusively on the prospect of an involuntary \nforced move from their present, appropriate placements caused entirely by DHFS’ allegedly \ninadequate  capitated  rates  during  CY  2004  and  2005  and  the  contracted  rates  paid  by  the \nMilwaukee CMO to their providers during the same period.  In fact, they have directly said this \nin  responses  to  interrogatories  provided to the State defendants during discovery.  In their \nAmended  Response  to  State  Defendants’  First  Set  of  Interrogatories  served  June  7,  2005, \nplaintiffs stated: \n  It is the position of the plaintiffs that deficiencies in any services provided \nto Milwaukee County Family Care recipients . . . are the result of the state \n                                                 \n  3In context, the Court’s description can only be construed as indicating that plaintiffs face \na real and immediate danger of being forced involuntarily into a more restrictive, less integrated \ninstitutional setting such as a nursing home (see R. 106:3, contrasting plaintiffs’ prospective \ninjuries with the facts in Bill M. ex rel. William M. v. Nebraska Dept. H.H.S., 408 F.3d 1096, \n1098  (8th  Cir.  2005)).    Although  the  Fourth  Amended  Complaint  does  not  contain  these \nassertions,  the  Court’s  interpretation  of  plaintiffs’  claims  based  on  affidavits  submitted  by \nplaintiffs’ experts effectively amends the Fourth Amended Complaint to include them. \n- 9 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 114     Filed 05/26/2006     Page 10 of 26(cid:10)\ndefendants’ failure to set an adequate capitated rate for calendar years 2000 \nthrough 2005. \n \nSee Exhibit E, at 2, attached to the Affidavit of the undersigned (emphasis supplied). \n  Accordingly, in order for a class to be certified in this matter, the class would have to \nshare  the  same  claimed  prospective  injury  as  that  accepted  by  the  Court  as  imminently \nthreatening the plaintiffs in this case—i.e., the real and immediate threat that other Family Care \nmembers will be involuntarily moved from their present AFH and CBRF residential placements \ncausing  immediate  “trauma  and  deterioration”  (R  86:8)  and  “forced  .  .  .  move[s]  to  an \ninstitutional setting” (R 106:3) as a result of inadequate capitated and contract rates paid during \nCY 2004 and 2005.  Settled Supreme Court precedent cited above plainly requires that putative \nclass members must “suffer the same injury” as the named plaintiffs before class standing can be \nrecognized.  See also Keele v. Wexler, 149 F.3d 589, 592 (7th Cir. 1998), quoting Schlesinger, \n418 U.S. at 216; Baby Neal For and By Kanter v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 56 (3d Cir. 1994). \n  The  class  plaintiffs  seek  to  represent  includes  all  Milwaukee  County  residents  with \ndisabilities who will “now or will in the future” be:  (1) eligible for Family Care, and (2) an \nappropriate candidate for residential services in AFHs and CBRFs (R. 101:1).  Quite plainly, the \nrequested  class  consists  primarily  if  not  almost  entirely  of  persons  who  are  not  remotely \nthreatened with the same injury plaintiffs claim to face. Because the proposed class improperly \nincludes those who lack standing to bring this action on their own behalf, class certification \nshould be denied.  See Rodriguez, 431 U.S. at 403; Schlesinger, 418 U.S. at 216; Keele, 149 F.3d \nat 592. \n- 10 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 114     Filed 05/26/2006     Page 11 of 26(cid:10)\nC.  The requested class is not sufficiently definite because it fails to \nidentify  those  individuals  actually  harmed  by  the  defendants’ \nallegedly wrongful conduct. \n  The other implicit condition contained in Rule 23(a) is that an “identifiable” class must \nexist.  Gomez v. Illinois State Bd. of Educ., 117 F.R.D. 394, 397 (N.D. Ill. 1987).  The proposed \nclass  definition  “must  be  precise,  objective  and  presently  ascertainable.”    In  re  Copper, \n196 F.R.D. at 353 (citations omitted; internal quotation omitted).  An identifiable class exists if \nits members can be ascertained by reference to “objective criteria.”  Gomez, 117 F.R.D. at 397. \n“A class description is insufficient, however, if membership is contingent on the prospective \nmember’s state of mind.”  Id. (citing cases).  There are two primary purposes of properly \nidentifying the proposed class.  First, a properly identified class alerts the parties and the court to \nthe burdens that such a process might entail; and second, proper identification of the class insures \nthat those individuals actually harmed by a defendant’s wrongful conduct will be recipients of the \nrelief eventually provided.  Simer v. Rios, 661 F.2d 655, 670 (7th Cir. 1981). \n  Plaintiffs argue that their class definition is appropriate because it identifies objectively \nwho should be included in the class.  See Brief at 2-3.  The class definition offered by plaintiffs \nserves neither of the purposes the identification of a proper class is supposed to serve.  Including \npersons based on current or future Family Care eligibility and on the individual’s appropriateness \nfor a community-based placement does precisely nothing to inform anyone what the case is \nsupposed to be about, nor does it in any way “insure[] that those actually harmed by defendants’ \nwrongful conduct will be the recipients of the relief eventually provided.”  Simer, 661 F.2d at \n670.4 \n                                                 \n  4The fact that the primary beneficiaries of the relief plaintiffs seek would be the providers \nand not the class of Family Care eligibles or recipients at all is discussed in Section I.D.3., below. \n- 11 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 114     Filed 05/26/2006     Page 12 of 26(cid:10)\nD.  Plaintiffs  have  failed  to  meet  their  burden  of  establishing  the \nrequired express elements of Rule 23(a), and in particular, have \nfailed  to  establish  numerosity  and  that  they  will  adequately \nrepresent the interests of the putative class. \n1.  Viewed  from  the  perspective  of  the  number  of  persons \nplaintiffs might have standing to represent, plaintiffs have \nfailed to establish the required numerosity. \nPlaintiffs argue superficially that, given the number of current and prospective Family \nCare participants generally and the number of Milwaukee Family Care participants currently \nresiding in AFHs and CBRFs in particular, there are literally thousands of members in the class \nthey seek to represent.  Brief at 3-4. And yes, superficially at least, plaintiffs make a plausible \nargument.  Once again,  however,  they  ignore  the  question  of  class  standing  and  the  more \nfundamental question of how many people plaintiffs might actually have standing to represent. \nLooking  behind  the  speculative  assertions  of  the  complaint  and  the  equally  speculative \npredictions of harm contained in the affidavits of plaintiffs’ experts, the fact is, plaintiffs have \nfailed to demonstrate that there are more than a handful of Family Care participants similarly \nsituated with themselves. \nPlaintiffs  correctly  observe  that  a  potential  class  size  of  forty  or  more  is  generally \nsufficient  to  support  certification.    See  Brief  at  3,  citing  Clarke  v.  Ford  Motor  Co., \n220 F.R.D. 568,  578  (E.D.  Wis.  2004).    The  parties  have  filed  a  Factual  Stipulation  in \nConnection with Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification (“Factual Stipulation”) (R. 100).  In \naddition, submitted with this brief are two affidavits which provide direct evidence, based on \npersonal knowledge and review of available records, concerning just how many persons in the \nclass plaintiffs seek to represent appear to have claims similar to those of the plaintiffs.  See \nJones  Aff.  and  Hennen  Aff.,  filed  herewith.    The  Factual  Stipulation  establishes  that  the \nMilwaukee CMO is currently serving approximately 5,800 persons enrolled in Family Care, with \n- 12 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 114     Filed 05/26/2006     Page 13 of 26(cid:10)\napproximately 19% of that total (1080) currently residing in 74 AFHs and 123 CBRFs (R. 100:1; \nHennen Aff., ¶ 12). \n  The affidavits provide further information directly rebutting plaintiffs’ dire predictions \nabout providers terminating their contracts with Family Care based on inadequate rates during \nCY 2004 and 2005 and resulting involuntary transfers of Family Care participants to other \nfacilities as a result of such contract terminations.  According to James Hennen, the current \nMilwaukee CMO contract administrator, during the period from January 1, 2004, to the present, \nonly  one  provider,  HIL,  has  given  the  CMO  the  required  prior  written  notice  of intent to \nterminate its contract (Hennen Aff., ¶ 4).  HIL is the provider of residential services for the \nremaining three named class representative plaintiffs in this lawsuit as well as two additional \nFamily Care participants who are not parties to this litigation (id., ¶ 4). \n  In addition, the Milwaukee CMO is aware of only one Family care residential provider \nthat has notified the CMO verbally that it planned to terminate residential services to two \nFamily Care members living in a group home provided under a contract with the CMO (Hennen \nAff., ¶ 5).  In that case, which occurred just recently in February 2006, the provider collaborated \nwith Family Care staff to transition these two persons to more integrated residential placements \nwith services continuing to be provided by the same agency (id.). \n  In the case of SRCA, which until recently provided residential services to two of the \nnamed plaintiffs, Lenore Czarnecki and John Gorton, although SRCA has repeatedly threatened \nto give written notice of its intent to terminate its Family Care contracts, it has never in fact done \nso (id., ¶ 6).  Moreover, although SCRA serves a substantial number of Family Care clients (70 \nby current count), those persons have not joined this litigation. (id., ¶ 7). \n- 13 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 114     Filed 05/26/2006     Page 14 of 26(cid:10)\n  Thus, evidence submitted by the State and county defendants documents that there have \nbeen three Milwaukee County Family Care residential providers who have either taken steps to \nterminate a small number of Family Care placements or, like SCRA have threatened but never \nactually done so.  In addition, the Affidavit of Gerald Kallas filed by plaintiffs (R. 78) contains \nthe assertion, speculative on its face, that a facility called Bayside Terrace was forced to close \n“sometime  in  2004”  allegedly  because  of  the  inadequacy  of  Family  Care  rates  and  that \n“[a]pproximately 100 residents had to be moved to other CBRFs and into nursing homes” \n(id., at 15). \n  As the Hennen affidavit plainly demonstrates, however, the actual facts are quite different \nfrom Kallas’ account (see Hennen Aff., ¶¶ 17-18).  According to Hennen, documents contained \nin the Milwaukee CMO files revealed that the Bayside facility consisted of two CBRFs, one \nlicensed for 52 beds and the other for 65 beds.  An entity called the Laureate Group purchased \nthe Bayside facility in June 2003 from a previous owner who had a Family Care contract with the \nMilwaukee CMO.  Although Laureate purchased with the intent to operate as a private pay \nfacility, it agreed to continue to provide care through the remaining months of 2003 to the 23 \nFamily Care participants living at Bayside at the time of the purchase (Hennen Aff., ¶ 18). \nIn December 2003, Laureate gave formal notice that it was terminating its Family Care \ncontract consistent with communications at the time it purchased the facility six months earlier. \nAll 23 Family Care participants were transitioned to other facilities appropriate to their assessed \nneeds (id.).  At the present time, the 15 remaining Family Care participants from that group \nreside primarily in other CBRFs (a total of 11 persons), one is currently in a hospice facility, one \nlives in a residential care apartment, and two moved out of the county and no longer are enrolled \nin Family Care.  None of the former Bayside Family Care residents is currently in a nursing \n- 14 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 114     Filed 05/26/2006     Page 15 of 26(cid:10)\nhome.  The ages of the former Bayside Family Care residents who died between June 2003 and \nthe present ranged between 78 and 102 years old (id.). \n  In addition to the fact that there is no objective evidence to support plaintiffs’ claims that \nlarge numbers of Family Care members receiving AFH and CBRF residential services have been \nor will imminently be transferred to different residential placements as a result of provider \ndissatisfaction with the CY 2004 and 2005 rates, there is literally no evidence, apart from the \nexamples of the named plaintiffs themselves, that Family Care residents have been subject to or \npotentially subject to involuntary5 transfers as a result of provider dissatisfaction with Family \nCare rates. \n  Family Care participants are provided by the CMO with a grievance procedure and an \nappeal process to address a participant’s dissatisfaction with a placement plan.  They may also \nfile a request for a fair hearing with the state Division of Hearings and Appeals (“DHA”) to \nchallenge a residential placement that is unacceptable to the participant (Jones Aff., ¶ 6).  During \nthe period from January 2004 to the present, DHFS personnel have been able to identify only \nthree instances in which CMO participants have filed CMO grievances or grievance appeals or \nfair hearing requests with DHA challenging a change of residential placement by the Milwaukee \nCMO (id., ¶ 7). \n  One of those complaints concerned a claim that the room and board rate, a cost which is \npaid by the Family Care recipient and not the CMO, was excessive (id., ¶¶ 5, 7).  In the second \ncase,  the  participant’s  daughter  wanted  her  mother  moved  to  a  nursing  home.    The  CMO \n                                                 \n  5Obviously, if a person transfers voluntarily to a different facility, there would be no \nADA or Rehabilitation Act claim, regardless of the level of care, integration or restrictiveness of \nthe placement. \n- 15 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 114     Filed 05/26/2006     Page 16 of 26(cid:10)\ndisagreed, since the nursing home would not have been the most integrated setting appropriate to \nthe mother’s needs.  The result was that the participant remained in her existing residence, a \nCBRF (id.).  In the third case, the participant wanted to remain in a particular CBRF close to her \ndaughter, but the CMO disapproved because the participant could not afford the room and board \nrate charged by the facility.  In this third case, the CMO offered the participant an alternative \nCBRF placement in at least as integrated a setting as the former CBRF (id.). \nNone of the Family Care participants filing grievances, appeals or fair hearing requests \ncomplaining  of  placement  decisions  during  the  period  from  January  2004  to  the  present \ncomplained of being moved involuntarily from an existing placement.  Thus, records of the \ngrievance, appeal or hearing mechanisms available to all Family Care participants for airing \ncomplaints about placement decisions directly contradict plaintiffs’ claims that Family Care \nparticipants are being forced out of their AFH or CBRF placements because providers of AFH \nand CBRF residential or day services are so dissatisfied with the 2004-05 actuarial or provider \nrates that they are refusing to provide Family Care community-based residential services. \n  Finally,  plaintiffs  themselves  have  admitted,  in  response  to  recent  discovery \ninterrogatories, that they cannot identify and are not aware of any Family Care participants who \nhave been forced to move from an AFH or CBRF into another AFH or CBRF, or into a nursing \nhome, skilled nursing facility or other institution “because that person’s first AFH or CBRF \nprovider has either cut the level of services provided or refused to serve Milwaukee County \nresidents with disabilities as a result of the capitated rates paid by DHFS for persons enrolled in \nthe Milwaukee County Family Care program.”  See Exhibit D, at 2, Plaintiffs’ Response to State \nDefendants Third Set of Interrogatories and Second Requests to Produce Documents, served \nMay 15, 2006, attached to Affidavit of the undersigned. \n- 16 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 114     Filed 05/26/2006     Page 17 of 26(cid:10)\nPlaintiffs have now had more than two years since filing this case to identify other \npersons being imminently threatened with the same injury as they claim in this action.  Their \nrecent discovery response concedes that they are unable to identify or locate a single other person \nwho shares their claimed injury. The affidavits of Hennen and Jones directly contradict the \nspeculative assertions of plaintiffs’ experts and of plaintiffs’ pleadings predicting that numerous \nFamily Care residents will be forced out of their homes and otherwise suffer dire consequences \nbecause of the claimed inadequacy of the Family Care rates.   In short, plaintiffs have utterly \nfailed to establish that the number of persons suffering the same or comparable injuries to those \nthey fear for themselves warrants class certification. \n2.  Plaintiffs’ claims are not typical of the class they seek to \nrepresent. \n  “‘A plaintiff’s claim is typical if it arises from the same event or practice or course of \nconduct that gives rise to the claims of other class members and his or her claims are based on \nthe  same  legal  theory.’”    De  La  Fuente  v.  Stokely-Van  Camp,  Inc.,  713 F.2d  225,  232 \n(7th Cir. 1983).  Three factors persuaded the court in De La Fuente that the plaintiffs had \nsatisfied the typicality requirement:  (1) the allegedly unlawful practices “remained essentially \nunchanged throughout the years in question;” (2) “[a]ll members of the class were subject to the \nsame allegedly unlawful practices;” and (3) these unlawful practices equally affected all members \nof the class.  Id. at 232.  “The typicality inquiry is intended to assess whether the action can be \nefficiently maintained as a class and whether the named plaintiffs have incentives that align with \nthose  of  absent  class  members  so  as  to  assure  that  the  absentees’  interests  will  be  fairly \nrepresented.”  Baby Neal, 43 F.3d at 57. \n- 17 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 114     Filed 05/26/2006     Page 18 of 26(cid:10)\n  Given  the  breadth  of  plaintiffs’  putative  class,  it  is  apparent  that  the  relatively \nidiosyncratic  claims  of  the  plaintiffs—all  residents  of  long  term  care  facilities  who  claim \nimminent injury personal to themselves based on the allegedly insufficient amount of money paid \nto their providers for the cost of their care—are hardly “typical” in any ordinary sense. \nOn the face of it, all three factors identified in the De La Fuente case, above, strongly \nsuggest that plaintiffs’ multiple challenges to the capitated rates paid by DHFS to the Milwaukee \nCMO and the contract rates paid by the CMO to plaintiffs’ providers lack the typicality required \nfor certification of a class under Rule 23(a)(3).  See De La Fuente, 713 F.2d at 232.  First, DHFS’ \ncapitated rates, which are the primary target of plaintiffs’ claims and which are revised and \nfederally  approved  each  successive  year,  have  risen  substantially  during  the  course  of  the \nsix-years Family Care has been in existence (see Jones Aff., ¶ 10).  Secondly, as already pointed \nout, only about one fifth of the putative class currently resides in CBRFs or AFHs, meaning that \napproximately 80% of the class is not even arguably subject to the “unlawful practices” about \nwhich plaintiffs complain.  Similarly, these “unlawful practices,” i.e., the rates paid to providers \nof long term community-based residential services in the Milwaukee County CMO, cannot be \nsaid to affect equally “all members” of the putative class.  Cf. De La Fuente, 713 F.2d at 232. \n3.  There are strong reasons to doubt that plaintiffs adequately \nrepresent the interests of the class they seek to represent. \n  The  “adequacy  of  representation”  requirement  of  Rule  23(a)(4)  has  two  parts:    the \nadequacy of the named plaintiffs’ counsel and the adequacy of representation by the named \nplaintiffs in protecting the separate and distinct interest of the class members.  Clay, 188 F.R.D. \nat 493 (citing cases).  The State defendants do not question that plaintiffs’ current counsel are \n- 18 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 114     Filed 05/26/2006     Page 19 of 26(cid:10)\n“qualified, experienced, and generally able to conduct the proposed litigation.”  Cf. Rozema, \n174 F.R.D. at 439. \n  In order for plaintiffs themselves to be fair and adequate class representatives, they \n(1) “must have sufficient interest in the outcome to ensure vigorous advocacy;” and (2) “must not \nhave  antagonistic  or  conflicting  interests  with  other  members  of  the  proposed  class.”    Id.; \nRosario,  963  F.2d  at  1018.    Furthermore,  for  purposes  of  determining  the  adequacy  of \nrepresentation, the stature and personal characteristics of the representatives may be examined. \nSee Massengill v. Board of Ed., Antioch Community High, 88 F.R.D. 181, 185 (N.D. Ill. 1980), \nciting Amos v. Board of Directors of City of Milwaukee, 408 F. Supp. 765 (E.D. Wis. 1976). \nPlaintiffs, “as fiduciaries of the class,” are required to “meet the high level of responsibility \nimposed on every class representative.”  Massengill, 88 F.R.D. at 185.  “Adequate representation \nis the foundation of all representative actions, and embodies the due process requirement that \neach litigant is entitled to his day in court.”  Gomez, 117 F.R.D. at 400 (internal citation omitted). \n  The three remaining named plaintiffs are developmentally disabled persons who have \nbeen adjudged incompetent to represent their own interests.  There is no reason to question the \ndedication of plaintiffs’ guardians to protecting zealously the best interests of their respective \nwards, and the State defendants do not do so.  It is quite another level of dedication, however, to \ndemonstrate  commitment  to  protecting  the  interests  of  the  entire  class  of  Family  Care \nparticipants that plaintiffs seek to represent.  Notwithstanding plaintiffs’ conclusory arguments \non this point, see Brief at 8-9, there are several factors that strongly suggest that plaintiffs’ \nrepresentatives are not prepared or equipped to do so in this case. \nPlaintiffs’ brief argues that plaintiffs “all feel strongly about getting to the bottom of the \nfunding issue and remaining in their current homes rather than face the trauma of moving and \n- 19 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 114     Filed 05/26/2006     Page 20 of 26(cid:10)\nprobable  deterioration,”  pointing  to  the  affidavits  submitted  by  the  guardians  of  plaintiffs \nBzdawka and Ehrlichman as evidence of “how strongly they feel about this.”  Id.  Again, there is \nno reason to doubt that the strength of the guardians’ concerns about their wards, as expressed in \nthe cited affidavits (see R:10 and 12).  With all due respect, however, there is no evidence that \nthe guardians’ dedication extends to protecting the interests of the entire class of Family Care \nparticipants they seek to represent.  Rather, the respective affidavits speak solely to protecting the \npersonal interests of the individual plaintiffs and the guardians’ concern that their wards’ lives \nnot be disrupted by having to move from one facility to another (id.). \nRecently, in fact, plaintiffs were asked to respond to a discovery request for information \nabout  the  extent  to  which  the plaintiffs’ guardians had visited other facilities or otherwise \nconsidered alternative facilities that might be suitable placements for the individual plaintiffs. \nSee Plaintiffs’ Response to State Defendants’ Third Set of Interrogatories at 3, attached to the \naffidavit of counsel as Exhibit D.  Plaintiffs responded flatly that the “guardians or agents of the \nindividual  plaintiffs  did  not  visit  any alternate AFHs or CBRFs or otherwise consider any \nalternate AFHs or CBRFs for their respective wards. . . . based on the belief that remaining [in \ntheir present placements] is necessary to provide the individual Plaintiffs with necessary services \nand prevent deterioration.”  Id.  Again, there is no reason to question the guardians’ concern for \ntheir wards, but the fact that they will not even visit alternative facilities where other members of \nthe class they claim to represent are living hardly bespeaks any interest, much less advocacy on \nbehalf of, the interests of the class as a whole. \nFurthermore, it is impossible to ignore the fact that this entire lawsuit is strong testimony \nto the plaintiffs’ alignment—not with the class they seek to represent—but with the individual \nfinancial interests of their respective providers.  In fact, at the moment, all of the named class \n- 20 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 114     Filed 05/26/2006     Page 21 of 26(cid:10)\nrepresentative plaintiffs are residents of facilities owned by HIL, the only Family Care provider \nof community-based residential services that has given written notice of its intent to terminate its \nFamily Care contract during the period covered by this litigation, CY 2004-05.  The providers, \nwhose own financial interest in this litigation is obvious, and not the plaintiffs or their guardians, \nhave been and continue to be the most vocal force behind this litigation.  Lincoln Burr and Dr. \nGerald  Kallas,  two  of  the  experts on whose testimony plaintiffs rely, have each submitted \nvoluminous affidavits decrying the Family Care capitated rates and the contract rates paid to \nproviders by the Milwaukee CMO (R:78, 79).  Burr and Kallas are the CEOs of HIL and SRCA, \nrespectively.6  HIL and SRCA, of course, are the two facilities in which the original plaintiffs \nhave resided. \nIndeed, it is the financial interests of these few providers in securing higher Family Care \nrates,  both  across-the-board  from  the  State  defendants  and  on  an  individual  basis  from \nMilwaukee County, that are the focus of the primary relief requested in this lawsuit, that of \nincreased Family Care rates.  A cynical person might suggest that this lawsuit has been and \ncontinues to be driven by the financial interests of two providers who have not hesitated to use \nhighly vulnerable individuals in their care as the stalking horses for this litigation.  Although \nthese two providers appear to be dissatisfied with the rates they receive from the Milwaukee \nCMO, the CMO continues to receive almost daily contacts from other providers interested in \njoining  the  Family  Care  network;  has  developed  contracts  with  new  providers  to  serve \n                                                 \n  6State defendants’ counsel have repeatedly requested that plaintiffs provide them with \ninformation required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B) concerning the compensation arrangements \nbetween plaintiffs and their experts.  See letters dated October 6 and November 16, 2004, and \nApril 27, 2005, contained in Exhibits A-C, attached to the affidavit of the undersigned.  To date, \nplaintiffs have never provided this information. \n- 21 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 114     Filed 05/26/2006     Page 22 of 26(cid:10)\nFamily Care members at rates lower than those charged by comparable HIL facilities; and has \nexpanded its contracts with five existing Family Care providers who wished to expand their \nFamily Care participation (Hennen Aff., ¶ 8). \nNot only does the close alignment of the named plaintiffs with their providers suggest a \nconflict of interest between the plaintiffs and the class of Family Care participants they seek to \nrepresent, but the form of financial relief sought—increased rates for providers of long term \nresidential  services—necessarily  conflicts  with  the  interests  of  the  class  of  Family  Care \nparticipants as a whole.  The Jones Affidavit explains: \n  Under the terms of the federal approvals that permit DHFS to operate \nFamily Care, DHFS is required to make capitated payments to CMOs at a level no \nhigher than that which the independent actuary finds is actuarially sound, and \nDHFS  is  not  permitted  to  supplement  those  payments.    Therefore,  if  the \nMilwaukee County CMO were directed by court order to raise its payment rates to \ncertain residential providers, the share of the total capitated payments available for \nservices for participants who do not reside in facilities operated by those certain \nproviders, as well as for participants who do not reside in a residential care \nfacility, would decrease. \n \nJones Aff., ¶ 12. \n  The Hennen affidavit further explains the direct effect on the Milwaukee CMO of an \norder requiring that particular residential providers be paid higher rates: \n  In order to fulfill its mandate to serve all eligible individuals with funding \nderived from a fixed capitated rate and to provide the maximum level of services \nto all Family Care members, the CMO contracts with service providers are based \nat least in part on an assessment of comparative cost-effectiveness.  The CMO \nmust provide for the needs of all Family Care members, only 19% of whom \ncurrently require services in an AFH or a CBRF.   A requirement that the CMO \ncontract with every available residential provider and pay the rates that each \nprovider  demands  based  on  the  provider’s  claimed  costs,  irrespective  of  a \nreasonable assessment of comparative cost effectiveness of the provider’s services \nto Family Care members, would divert limited available funds from providing \nnecessary services to other Family Care members. \n \nHennen Aff., ¶ 13. \n- 22 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 114     Filed 05/26/2006     Page 23 of 26(cid:10)\n  In short, to the extent the primary relief sought would benefit particular Family Care \nproviders or a limited class of Family Care providers, plaintiffs are pursuing relief that may fairly \nbe characterized as antagonistic to the interests of the class they seek to represent as a whole. \nThere is nothing inherently questionable about seeking such relief on plaintiffs’ own behalf. \nHowever, doing so under the guise of protecting the interests of the class as a whole is strong \nevidence that plaintiffs are pursuing interests that are antagonistic to the class they seek to \nrepresent.  See Rosario, 963 F.2d at 1018. \n  This record simply fails to support plaintiffs’ claims that they are equipped to represent \nadequately the class of Family Care participants as a whole. \nII.  INJUNCTIVE  RELIEF  WITH  RESPECT  TO  THE  CLASS  AS  A \nWHOLE IS NOT APPROPRIATE. \n  Plaintiffs seek to proceed as a class under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) which declares that \nclass certification under that section is appropriate when “the party opposing the class has acted \nor refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final \ninjunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.”  Two \nbasic requirements must be satisfied under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2):  (1) the party opposing the \nclass must have acted in a consistent manner toward members of the class so that its actions may \nbe viewed as part of a pattern of activity; and (2) final injunctive or corresponding relief must be \nappropriate.  Edmondson v. Simon, 86 F.R.D. 375, 382-83 (N.D. Ill. 1980) (citations omitted). \n  To be certified under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), the interests of the class members must be \n“cohesive  and  homogeneous.”    Lemon  v.  Intern.  Union  Operating  Eng’rs,  Loc.  139, \n216 F.3d 577,  580  (7th  Cir.  2000).    Although  the  rule  itself  is  silent  regarding  whether \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) certification is permissible when the plaintiffs request individualized \n- 23 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 114     Filed 05/26/2006     Page 24 of 26(cid:10)\nrelief (most commonly, monetary damages), the prevailing rule in the Seventh Circuit is that \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) will not support certification of a case that demands relief that requires \njudicial inquiry into the particularized merits of each individual’s claim.  Id. at 580-81.  Id.  For \nthese reasons, “‘Rule 23(b)(2) may not be invoked in a case requiring significant individual \nliability or defense issues which would require separate hearings for each class member in order \nto establish the defendants’ liability.’”  Clay, 188 F.R.D. at 495, quoting Arch v. American \nTobacco Co., Inc., 175 F.R.D. 469, 482 (E.D. Pa. 1997). \n  Apart from the concerns, addressed above, that the interests of the class members are not \n“cohesive and homogeneous,” at least with respect to the relief sought in this litigation, the State \ndefendants  advance  two  objections  to  whether  final  injunctive  or  corresponding  relief  is \nappropriate in this case.  Cf. Edmonson, 86 F.R.D. at 382-83. \n  First, plaintiffs’ emphasis on the funding and rates for Family Care obscures the fact that \nit is the rights of the individual Family Care recipients that are at issue in this case.  Those \ninterests in living in the least restrictive most integrated setting are necessarily protected on an \nindividual  case-by-case  basis.    The  Milwaukee  County  CMO  has  a  placement  team  which \ncontinuously monitors vacancies in AFHs and CBRFs for Family Care members who may be in \nneed of such placements, and numerous vacancies currently exist.  The Milwaukee County CMO \nwill not move a Family Care member unless there is a placement available in an appropriate \nfacility which will satisfy the member’s plan of care and provide care and treatment in the most \nintegrated setting commensurate with the member’s needs, with due consideration for continuity \nof care and the member’s social relationships (Hennen Aff., ¶¶ 9-10).  Indeed, the Family Care \nprogram includes a grievance, appeal and hearing process that is specifically designed to protect \n- 24 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 114     Filed 05/26/2006     Page 25 of 26(cid:10)\nthose interests, so that a broad injunction requiring that the defendants refrain from violating the \nADA or Rehabilitation Act is, as a practical matter, redundant in this context. \n  Moreover, the U.S. Supreme Court has long held that a federal court “cannot issue a \ngeneral injunction against all possible breaches of the law” and, as a result, has a duty to avoid “a \nsweeping injunction to obey the law.”  Swift & Co. v. United States, 196 U.S. 375, 396 and 401 \n(1905).  A court order requiring a defendant to obey a law that the defendant already has a \ngeneral duty to obey is no more than a redundancy unless it is directed at some specific threat of \na future illegality.  See United States v. Turner, 601 F. Supp. 757, 769 (E.D. Wis. 1985).  “Such \n‘obey  the  law’  injunctions  cannot  be  sustained.”    Payne  v.  Travenol  Laboratories,  Inc., \n565 F.2d 895, 898 (5th Cir. 1978); see also Hughey v. JMS Development Corp., 78 F.3d 1523, \n1531 (11th Cir. 1996) (“appellate courts will not countenance injunctions that merely require \nsomeone to ‘obey the law.’”).  The injunctive and declaratory relief sought by plaintiffs in the \npresent case with respect to the purported class as a whole is clearly inappropriate under this \nstandard. \n- 25 - \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 114     Filed 05/26/2006     Page 26 of 26(cid:10)\nCONCLUSION \n  For the reasons discussed above, the State defendants respectfully submit that plaintiffs’ \nRenewed Motion for Class Certification must be denied. \n  Dated this 26th day of May, 2006. \n  PEGGY A.

Kathleen Johnson’s case has been subject to ongoing \nreevaluation and multiple grievances and appeals. \n165.  Admits \n166.   Answering paragraph 166, admits that Kathleen Johnson’s plan of care has been \nreevaluated from time to time but not necessarily as a consequence of the “March 1, 2004 \nmemorandum and guidelines”.

Case  No. 04-C-0193 \n \nMILWAUKEE COUNTY, \n \n      Defendant. \n_____________________________________________________________________ \n \nBRIEF IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION,   \nAN EXPEDITED SCHEDULING CONFERENCE AND FOR \nPERMISSION TO FILE FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n_____________________________________________________________________ \nINTRODUCTION \n  This case has grown out of a dispute over appropriate funding for disability services \nin Milwaukee County. Unlike any other Wisconsin county, there are two distinct systems for \nfunding disability services. The essence of plai ntiffs' claim is that the \"under 60\" group \nreceives more favorable funding treatment in comparison to the \"60 and over\" group who \nare served by the Family Care program. Another issue arose when a particular residential \nprovider complained to the County about the level of funding, threatened to terminate and \nthen did terminate its contract for serving persons who are 60 and over. The County has \ntaken the position that it can move the affected individuals over their guardians' objections \nand, if the guardians refuse, to seek their replacement with guardians who will approve the \nmoves. This threat to employ different procedures against guardians of persons 60 and \nover and the clients themselves is another way in which the Family Care group is treated \n\nless favorably than similar persons under the age of 60. This violates the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act, the Equal Protection guarantees in both the United \nStates and Wisconsin Constitutions, and various Wisconsin statutes. \n  The current named plaintiffs, Gerald Nelson and Joan Bzdawka, were the first to be \nthreatened with moving to another facility over their guardians' objections based on the \nfunding dispute involving their residential pr ovider, Homes for Independent Living. Two \nother clients of HIL are now  in that situation as well.  They are Sandra Ehrlichman and \nMarilyn Berdikoff. The Milwaukee County Department on Aging has given notice that Ms. \nBzdawka and Ms. Ehrlichman will be moved on or after April 16, 2004. The guardians of the \nothers have been told that Mr. Nelson and Ms. Berdikoff will also be moved but they have \nnot been given notice of a specific date or place. \n  Nelson and Bzdawka filed a motion for preliminary injunction in order to keep them in \ntheir current residential and day program placements pending further proceedings. They \nare not seeking a broad declaration concerning the utlimate legal issues in the case at this \npoint. They are only seeking to preserve thes tatus quo. Unfortunately, Sandra Erhrlichman \nand Marilyn Berdikoff are not yet parties in hte case and a class has not yet been certified. \nThey cannot request the same temporary relief unless they are first allowed to join the case \nas plaintiffs. That is the reason for the  additional motion for permi ssion to file a first \namended complaint. The \"first amended\" language isi ntentional. This case is very complex \nand it is likely that there will be additional legalc laims once discovery has clarified several \nfactual issues. It is possible that additional defendants will be added. Plaintiffs are not in a \nposition to amend the complaint in regard to additional claims and parties at this time. Once \nthe Court has resolved the request for tempor ary relief, it would be appropriate to set \n  2\n\ndeadlines for discovery, substantive amendments  to the complaint, a class certification \nmotion and dispositive motions.        \n  HIL has always been willing to sign a new annualc ontract to continue serving clients \n60 and over if the rates are  increased. It has also told  DOA or MCDA (apparently the \nDepartment prefers this acronym to \"DOA\" in its own correspondence.) that it will continue \nto serve the named plaintiffs and others affected by the funding issue under the existing \nrate structure. HIL actually had an agreement with MCDA to do this and then the notices \nregarding Joan Bzdawka and Sandra Ehrlichman went out anyway. This situation presents \nall of the factors calling for a temporary  order to prevent imminent harm and the Court \nshould enter a preliminary injunction to preserve the status quo. \nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n  Gerald  Nelson and Joan Bzdawka's guardians first attempted to stop the \nDepartment on Aging's plans to move them by filing petitions in Milwaukee County Probate \nCourt under Wisconsin Chapter 55. The Bzdawka petition was filed on November 14, 2003 \nand the Nelson petition was filed on November  17, 2003. Both petitions also sought the \nsame declaratory and injunctive relief that is being pursued here, but the County moved to \ndismiss on the grounds that a Chapter 55 review procedure was not the proper forum for \nthese issues. Rather than litigate an issue  of procedure, Nelson and Bzdawka filed the \ncurrent  action on January 28, 2004 in Milw aukee  County Circuit Court. (Case No. \n04CV000862). Plaintiffs' counsel and the County' s counsel agreed that the substantive \nissues could all be resolved in the civil actiona nd stipulated to the dismissal of the Probate \n  3\n\nCourt petitions. They were dismissed by Judge Kitty Brennan on February 17. [Pledl-A]. 1 \nThe County filed its notice of removal  on February 25 and answered the complaint on \nMarch 8. After receiving notices that threat ened to move several HIL clients on April 5, \nplaintiffs filed a preliminary injunction motion on March 31. That deadline was extended. \nAdditional  notices were then sent to  the  guardians for Joan Bzdawka and Sandra \nEhrlichman announcing that they would be movedo n or after April 16. The Department on \nAging still intends to move Gerald Nelson and Marilyn Berdikoff but no definite date has \nbeen set for these moves.  \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\nDISABILITY SERVICES - PROGRAMS AND FUNDING \n  There are no real disputes about the provision of disability services in Wisconsin and \nfunding for those services. (The County admitted paragraphs 5, 8, 9, 10, 12 - 16 and 20 of \nthe original complaint.) Every Wisconsin county is required to provide specified disability \nservices. Wis.Stat., §46.215, 51.42 an 51.437. Pe rsons receiving those services have \nvarious rights under the Wisconsin Patients Rights Statute including the right to the least \nrestrictive environment and appropriate treatment. Wis.Stat., §51.61(1)(e) & (f). Wisconsin's \nlong-term placement statute, Chapter 55, contains various substantive and procedural \nprotections for individuals who meet the criteria for protective placement. The petitions filed \nin Probate Court on behalf of Nelson and Bzdawka  were based on their special status \n                                            \n1 All references to affidavits will include the name of the affiant and paragraph number, for example: \n[Burr: ¶6]. All references to exhibits will include hte name of the affidavit to whicht hey are attached \nalong with a page number if appropriate, for example: [Burr-A] or [Burr-A:3]. References to \ndeposition transcripts will contain name and page number, for example: [Lyday:12-13]. There is one \nother point regarding deposition transcripts. The parteis have initially received rough drafts and are \nwaiting for finished transcripts so they are not being filed with the Court at this time. \n  4\n\nunder Chapter 55 as well as the other statutory provisions that apply to all individuals who \nreceive disability services.  \n  Since 1981, there has been a move towards serving more persons with disabilities in \nthe community. The funding vehicle for this tarnsition has been a series of programs based \non agreements that each state signs with the Federal government waiving certain Medicaid \nregulations in order to redirect funds that  had been going to institutional care. They are \ncommonly known as \"waiver\" programs. In  Wisconsin, the specific programs are the \nCommunity Integration Program (CIP), Community Options Program (COP) and Brain \nInjury Waiver (BIW). The waiver progr ams had been the primary  means of funding \ncommunity services for persons with disabilities in Wisconsin before Family Care. \n  Geri Lyday, Administrator of the Milwaukee County Disability Services Division was \ndeposed on April 6, 2004. DSD was formerly know n as the Adult Services Division. Ms. \nLyday gave the following estimates of the number of individuals receiving services from the \ntwo units within DSD that provide long-term services for persons with developmental and \nphysical disabilities: \n  Developmental Disabilities     Physical Disabilities\n  CIP-1a program     250           COP program  750   \n  CIP-1b program  3,500    CIP  program   295 \n        BIW  program     50 \n[Lyday: 13-15]. There are other smaller funding sources used by DSD but this is sufficient \nto show the approximate number of clients under 60 being se rved in waiver programs. \nPlaintiffs counsel had previously made a request that DSD provide the number of clients \nwho would turn 60 during each calendar year from 2004 to 2010. Ms. Lyday responded in a \n  5\n\nletter dated March 3, 2004 with the following data: \n      Year       DD Clients     PD Clients        Total\n    2004    44    104    148 \n    2005    52    135    187 \n    2006    59    134    193 \n    2007    62    160    222 \n    2008    61    139    200 \n    2009    90    116    206 \n    2010    72    119    191 \n \nObviously, all of the roughly 5,000 clients cu rrently being by served by DSD in these \nprograms will eventually turn 60 if they live long enough. \n  Ms. Lyday was asked about the funding process for clients in the waiver programs. \nShe explained the assessment process and how  the plans were then reviewed and \napproved by the State. [Lyday: 26-28]. It is  possible to supplement CIP plans with COP \nfunds if additional funding is required. [26]. She did not believe that the assessors \"have \nbeen approving things that people don't need\" or \"approving unnecessary services.\" [26-\n28]. She was asked about the role of the guardian and the following exchange ensued: \n  Q.  And do you understand that to be a legal requirement from the state, \n    that guardians of people who have guardians actually have to sign the \n    person into a residential facility or a day program or an employment \n   program  or whatever? \n \n    MS. POULOS: Object to the question. It's asking for a conclusion  \n    beyond her knowledge. You can answer if you know. \n \n  BY MR. PLEDL: \n \n  Q.   If you know, you can answer. \n \n  A.   I know that it is a requirement of the waivers. So individuals   \n    participating in the waiver in order to receive funding, the guardian  \n    must sign off on the plan.       [Lyday: 37-38]. \nThis is consistent with Mr. Burr's affidavit. He said that in his experience, the only way in \n  6\n\nwhich admissions to CBRFs have occurred or can occur is with guardian involvement and \napproval. [Burr: ¶16].There are also specific provisions in the regulations pertaining to both \ntypes of group homes regarding guardian approval for the admission to occur. Wis. Adm. \nCode, HFS §83.16(1) (CBRF admissions);  and HFS §88.06(2)(b) (Adult Family Home \nadmissions.) These various regulations concerning guardian approval are also consistent \nwith the basic authority of theg uardian, who \"may have custody of the person, may receive \nall notices on behalf of the person and may act in all proceedings as an advocate of the \nperson.\" Wis. Stat., §880.38(1). \n  Mr. Burr's affidavit contains a detailed  listing of the daily rates received from \nMilwaukee County DSD for persons under 60 who are funded through the waiver programs.  \n[Burr: ¶¶26 29]. Ms. Lyday was not able to say whether the DSD rates in the affidavit were \naccurate or not and agreed that her staff would verify them. [Lyday: 47-49]. She said that \nDSD did give rate increases to individual provdiers although it did not give out increases on \nan ongoing basis. [42]. She recalled a rate increase given to some providers in 2002, but \nwould have to ask her staff for information concerning any other rate increases. [43-45]. \nShe said that DSD does not have a policy against rate increases for providers based on \nincreased costs. [44].   \nFAMILY CARE \n  The Wisconsin Legislature authorized the establishment of pilot programs around \nthe State that would provide similar care  but using a funding system different from the \nwaiver programs. Wis. Stat., §§46.2805 - 46. 2895. Marjorie (Meg) Gleeson, Assistant \nDirector for Long-Term Support for the Milwaukee County Department on Aging was \ndeposed on April 7 and 8. She described the basic principle of Family Care. The current \n  7\n\nmonthly rate is $1,810.61 for clients receiv ing the most common le vel of service and \n$674.49 for clients who have fewer needs  based on an evaluation. [Gleeson:14-17]. \nMilwaukee County currently has about 5200 persons in Family Care and about 160 of those \nare at the lower rate. [20 ]. The State pays the appropriate  monthly amount times the \nnumber of members and then Milwaukee County pays for specified services out of these \nfunds. [20-21]. About 26% of ht e Family Care members live in CBRFs, Adult Family Homes \nor Residential Care Apartment Complexes and htese residential services are paid out of the \nmonthly capitated amount. [22]. The $1810.61 is an average amount and this means that \nthere are clients receiving services that cost less as well as clients receiving services that \ncost more. [28]. \n  Ms. Gleeson said that HIL was their highest cost provider, but Family Care had not \ntaken any steps to terminate their contract piror to the time HIL ddi  so. [Gleeson I: 41]. She \nsaid that HIL had \"always request[ed] a rate increase on an annual basis.\" [Gleeson II; 19]. \nOther providers did so as well, [20], however,n o Family Care provider has ever been given \na rate increase based on cost increases. [22]. Ms. Gleeson was not aware of anything in \nthe Family Care legislation or regulations that would prohibit giving rate increases to CBRF \nproviders. [22]. She did not know whether the provider grievance process could address a \nrate dispute like this. [40-41]. Here is the next exchange: \n  Q.  And is there anything else that HIL could've done other than what they \n    did to attempt to secure a higher rate from Family Care and continue \n   serving  these people? \n \n  A.  Not that I'm aware of, no.       [Gleeson II: 41] \nWhen asked about what recourse the Department on Aging would have if the guardians \nwanted their wards to stay in the HIL homesw  here they now live and refused to sign them \n  8\n\ninto other CBRFs, Ms. Gleeson said she be lieved that DOA could seek to change the \nguardians. [54].  \n  Mr. Burr's affidavit says that he notifiedt he Department on Aging that HIL was wililng \nto continue serving the affected clients while the liitgation was pending. [Burr: ¶36].        The \nDepartment on Aging accepted this offer. Burr-D is a letter from Diane Baumbach, DOA \nContract Specialist, to Mr. Burr dated March 10, 2004. Ms. Gleeson said that she approved \nthis letter. [Gleeson II: 42-43]. It said: \nYou offered to keep Gerald N. and Joan B. in their current residences past \nthe contract termination date of April  1, 2004 at the existing service rates. \nMCDA-CMO  accepts your offer c ontingent  upon the execution of the \nenclosed Memorandum of Understanding effective April 1, 2004. \n \n[Burr-D]. HIL executed and returned the Memorandum of Understanding as required, but \naccording to Ms. Gleeson: \"We did not si gn the MOU. [Gleeson II: 42]. There was no \nexplanation beyond \"seeking further advice  about the MOU.\" [Id.] DOA made no other \nefforts to resolve the impasse and did not conside rwaiving its rate policies in this instance.  \n  Mr. Burr's affidavit lists the different rates being paid by various funding sources for \nthe five HIL homes located in Milwaukee County and summarizes those rates as follows: \nThe average daily CBRF rate for a ll 18 Milwaukee County DSD clients is \n$174.82 and including the 4 clients from ohter counties results in an average \ndaily rate for all clients other than those funded by Milwaukee County DOA of \n$180.53. The average daily rate for the 5 DOA clients is $161.80. \n \n[Burr: ¶27]. There is also a 21% differ ence between what DSD and DOA pay for the \nParagon day program rate. [¶29]. Despite the  losses that these rates represent, HIL is \nwilling to continue serving all of the affected clienst at the existing rates. The last line of Mr. \nBurr's affidavit says \"we continue to believe that  it is in our clients'  best interests not to \nmove them until the legal issues have been resolved. [Burr: ¶37].  \n  9\n\nTHE PLAINTIFFS \n  Gerald Nelson, Joan Bzdawka, Marilyn  Berdikoff and Sandra Ehrlichman are all \nfacing an involuntary move that will take themo ut of the homes and day programs to which \nthey are accustomed. They will lose friends and face  unfamiliar surroundings. Mr. Burr \nrelated the concerns of HIL staff about the other Joan and the negative effects of the move. \n[Burr: ¶34]. He believes that moving the ot hers presents a substantial risk that they will \ndeteriorate and even require a more restrictive placement. [Id.]. Mr. Miller is concerned that \nmoving Joan Bzdawka will be harmful to her. [Miller: ¶17]. Sandra Ehrlichman's guardian \n(her sister) is especially concerned because  of behavior problems that Sandra has had \nsince her father's death. [Steeves: ¶10]. A special team from Southern Wisconsin Center \nwas brought in for a consultatoi n. [Id.]. Ms. Steeves believes that a move would be harmful \nand is concerned that she will deteriorate and be placed back in an institution. [Steeves: \n¶18-19].  \n  Plaintiffs also hope to present testimony or written reports from Dr. Marta Muller, an \nHIL staff psychiatrist, as to any effects that the proposed moves will have on the affected \nresidents. (Her evaluations are not yet complete and counsel does not yet have any written \nreports to share with the County's counsel.)   \n  10\n\nARGUMENT \nI.  PLAINTIFFS SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO AMEND THEIR COMPLAINT TO ADD \n  TWO ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE FACING THE SAME TREATMENT \n  BY MILWAUKEE COUNTY.  \n \n  Leave to amend a complaint should be \"freely given\" unless there has been undue \ndelay or prejudice to the defendant. Rule 15(a), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure;F oman v. \nDavis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962). The decision is left to the court's discretion. Tavarez v. \nO'Malley, 826 F. 2d 671, 678 (7th Cir. 1987). This casei s at a very early stage. The Court \nhas not yet scheduled or conducted a scheduling conference. The amendment does not \nmake any substantive changes to the complaint beyond adding parties and a jurisdictional \nstatement. The County will not be prejudiced. The two new plaintiffs are already members \nof the putative class. They could file a separate action but it would be related to this case \nand that would just create the  need to consolidate. The interests of justice and judicial \neconomy call for permitting the amendment.  \n \nII.  PLAINTIFFS  ARE ENTITLED TO  THE  ENTRY OF A PRELIMINARY \n  INJUNCTION TO PREVENT MILWAUKEE COUNTY FROM MOVING THEM TO \n  A DIFFERENT RESIDENTIAL FACILITY AND DAY PROGRAM WITHOUT THEIR \n  GUARDIANS' CONSENT. \n \n  A.  Introduction - standards for granting a preliminary injunction.\n  A party must meet two threshold requiremenst to obtain a preliminary injunction:   (1) \n“some likelihood” of succeeding on the merits, and (2) lack of adequate remedy at law such \nthat movant will suffer irreparable harm  if preliminary relief is denied.   Washington v. \nIndiana High School Athletic Association, Inc., 181 F.3d 840, 845 (7th Cir. 1999); Abbott \nLaboratories v. Mead Johnson & Co., 971 F.2d 6, 11 (7th Cir. 1 992).  Once the movant \nmeets these two threshold requirements, theC  ourt then proceeds to balance the harms to \n  11\n\nthe parties, and any effect on the public interest.   Washington, 181 F.3d at 845; Roth v. \nLutheran General Hospital, 57 F.3d 1446, 1453 (7th Cir. 1995). \n  The plight of the plaintiffs here presents hte classic case in which a court must grant \npreliminary relief if its final judgment is to have any force or effect. The essence of their \nclaim is that County disability service clients who are 60 and over have an inferior funding \nsystem, are subject to having the decisions of their guardians discounted and must then \nmove from their homes and day programs in  situations where similar persons under 60 \nwould not be affected. This is discrimination under the American with Disabilities Act and \n§504 of the Rehabilitation Act .2 There is ample evidence that any move will be harmful and \ndisruptive. Once that disruption and the associated trauma have occurred, any ruling in \nplaintiffs' favor will be completely ineffectual. There will be no similar harm to the County if it \nis restrained from moving the plaintiffs  and this is always a powerful argument for \nmaintaining the status quo. \n  B.  Plaintiffs have standing to challenge the Milwaukee County Department \n   on Aging's policies and procedures.\n \n  The plaintiffs are challenging a set of policies and procedures that affect 60 and over \nclients as a group. The County may try reframe the case as being just about HIL or may \nargue that HIL and the Department on Aging would probably be unable to agree on a rate \nincrease even if the Department's policy of never granting rate increases to anyone were \n                                            \n2 Plaintiffs have also asserted substantive claims under Wisconsin Chapters 51 and 55 and the \nUnited States and Wisconsin Constitutions. Given that complete  relief can be granted at this \njuncture based on the Federal statutory claims, plaintiffs have chosen nott o argue these claims in \nconnection with their preliminary injunction motion. However, the state-law and §1983 claims are \nnot being abandoned. Plaintiffs do intend to assert and argue these claims after further discovery \nand factual development. Also, some discussion of Chapters 55 and 880 is necessary and  was \nincluded in the statement of facts to describe the role of the guardian under Wisconsin law and the \nhandling of placement issues by the circuit court as a backdrop for the plaintiffs' discrimination \nclaims.     \n  12\n\nchanged. This would misplace the proper focus of the standing inquiry: \nWhen the government erects a barrier that makes it more difficult for member \nof one class to obtain a  benefit than it is for  members another group, a \nmember of the former group seeking to challenge the barrier need not allege \nthat he would have obtained the benefit  but for the barrier to establish \nstanding. \n \nNortheastern Florida Chapter of the Associated General Contractors of America v. City of \nJacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 666 (1993). The Seventh Circuit has said: \n[S]tanding does not require a perfectly  clear title to the claim sued upon.   \nUnited States v. $557,933.89, More or Less, in U.S. Funds, 287 F.3d 66, 75, \n78-79 (2d Cir.2002); United States v. Rodriguez-Aguirre, 264 F.3d 1195, \n1204 (10th Cir.2001).  This is a corollary of the probabilistic character of the \nrequirement of standing, upon which we  have commented in other cases, \nsuch as Diaz v. Duckworth, 143 F.3d 345, 347 (7th Cir.1998), and Price v. \nPierce, 823 F.2d 1114, 1118 (7th Cir.1987); see also Hohn v. United States, \n262 F.3d 811, 818 (8th Cir.2001).  \"A reasonable probability that a plaintiff \nwill get an apartment that he wants sooner if he wins his suit is a sufficiently \ntangible expected benefit of suit to conefr standing under the liberal prni ciples \nthat prevail nowadays,\" as we said in Price... \n \nMorlan v. Universal Guaranty Life Insurance Company, 298 F. 3d 609, 620 (7th Cir.2002).  \nThis liberal standing rule was also discussed in a case involving a veterans hiring \npreference:  \"Each class member is better off when the preference is being enforced than \nwhen it isn't.  They may not get the job b, ut they are guaranteed the preference.\"  Veterans \nLegal  Defense Fund v. Schwartz ,  330 F.3d 937, n.2 (7th Cir.2003); see  Uhl  v. \nThoroughbred Technology and Telecommunications, Inc., 300 F.3d 978, 986 (7th Cir.2002) \n(one named plaintiff may represent both \"cable side\" and \"non-cable\" subgroups in case \nconcerning fiber optic cables buried on railroad rights-of-way since membership in either \ngroup will not be determined until the line is surveyed). \n  There is sufficient evidence to show  that HIL will continue to serve the named \nplaintiffs and other HIL residents who will turn 60if  DOA's policy is changed. It is the finality \n  13\n\nof the \"no increase\" policy and not any specific potential rate increase that has brought HIL \nand DOA to this point. HIL is not satisfied with the rate increases it has received from the \nDisability Services Division for persons under 60, but there have been some rate nicreases \nand there is the possibility of future incr eases. Rational providers may well decide to \ncontinue a contractual relationship with a fundnig source under these circumstances as HIL \nhas done with DOA up to this point and continuest o do with DSD. Concern for their clients \nwill also encourage many providers to cont inue even when financial conditions are not \nperfect. The bottom line is that DOA's \"no in crease\" policy and the policy of overriding \nguardian decisions are having a negative effect on the persons being served by HIL right \nnow and this will continue in the future. (A dditional HIL clients now served by DSD will \nreach their 60th birthday and encounter the samed iscriminatory policy along with clients of \nother providers.) These plainti ffs as well as the putative class itself have standing to \nchallenge both policies.  \nC.  Plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on the merits on their \nclaims under the Americans w ith Disabilities Act and §504 of the \nRehabilitation Act. \n \nThe first threshold requirement, likelihood of success on the merits “generally weighs \nmost heavily in a court’s determination.”  Davids v. Coyhis, 857 F. Supp. 641, 646 (E.D. \nWis. 1994).  The standard is much  lower than certainty or s ubstantial probability; it is \nenough that the Plaintiff’s chances are “better than negligible.”  National People’s Action v. \nVillage of Wilmette, 914 F.2d 1008, 1010 (7th Cir. 1990),c ert. denied, 499 U.S. 921 (1991).  \nThe level of proof is not the same as that r equired at a trial on the merits.  “[A]necdotal \naccounts” are sufficient.  Abbott Laboratories, 971 F.2d at 15; see Vaughan Mfg. Co. v. \nBrikam Int’l. Inc., 814 F.2d 346, 349 (7th Cir. 1987). \n  14\n\nIt is clear that DOA's policies and practicesd  isfavor persons 60 and over in several \nways. First, the lower rates for identical services and the \"no increase\" policy affect basic \naccess to residential care and day programming andt he right of individuals to stay in their \nhomes. Second, DOA's policy of overriding guar dian decisions violates basic rights of \nguardians and wards. Third, the lower DOA rates substantially increase the likelihood of \nmoving, disruption and admission to an institution. Since persons under 60 are not affected \nin the same, the differential treatment is clear. The only question is whether this particular \nform of differential treatment is discrimination under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. \nThe Americans with Disabilities Act is a comprehensive \"national mandate for the \nelimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.\" 42 U.S.C. §12101(b)(1). \nThe \"Rehabilitation Act is materially identical to and the model for the ADA.\" Crawford v. \nIndiana Department of Corrections, 115 F.3d 481, 483 (7th Cir.  1997) (other citations \nomitted). \"[Title II of the ADA] essentially simply extends the antidiscrimination prohibition \nembodied in §504 to all actions of state and  local governments.\" H.R.Rep. No. 485(II), \n101st Cong., 2d Sess. 84 (1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 267, 303, 367.    \nA violation of Title II may be established by hsowing: (1) that the affected clients of a \ndisability service provider are \"qualified individuasl with a disability.\"; (2) that the clients \"are \nbeing excluded from participation in or denied t he benefits of some service, program or \nactivity by reason of their disability\"; by (3) a public entity.W  isconsin Community Service v. \nCity of Milwaukee, Case No. 01-C-0575 (E.D. Wis. March 18, 2004), slip op. at 13, (\"WCS \nII\") citing see First Step, Inc. v. City of New London , 247 F.Supp. 2d 135, 149 (D.Conn. \n2003); Innovative Health Systems, Inc. v. City of White Plains , 931 F. Supp. 222, 238 \n(S.D.N.Y. 1996). The County is a public entity and has admitted that the named plaintiffs \n  15\n\nand the putative class members are qualified individuals pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §12131(2) \nand 29 U.S.C. §705(9). (Complai nt ¶¶76 & 81; Answer ¶¶76  & 81). The only issue is \nwhether the County's actions constitute discrimination. \n(1)  The Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act \nprohibit actual and potential institutional segregation of persons \nwith disabilities. \n \n\"[B]oth [the Rehabilitation  Act] and the Americans with Disabilities Act entitle \ndisabled persons (as the plaintiffs undoubtedly are) to care in the least restrictive possible \nenvironment.\" Bruggeman v. Blagojevich, 324 F.3d 906, 911 (7th Cir. 2003). This is based \non the United States Supreme Court's landmark ruling in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, \n600 (1999). Institutionalization is a form of discrimination even if the plaintiffs can identify no \ncomparison class. 527 U.S. at  598. Institutional placemen t \"perpetuates unwarranted \nassumptions  that persons so isolated are  incapable  or unworthy of participating in \ncommunity life.\" 527 U.S. at 600. It also \"severely diminishes the everyday life activities of \nindividuals,  including family relations, soci al  contacts, work options, economic \nindependence, educational advancement and cultural enrichment.\" 527 U.S. at 601. \nThe Olmstead concept is not limited to persons in institutions trying to get out. The \nTenth Circuit has applied it to a publicly-funded perscription drug benefit where the plaintiffs \nmerely alleged that it increased t he likelihood of nursing home placement.  Fisher v. \nOklahoma Health Care Authority, 335 F.3d 1175, 1182 (10th Cir. 2003). It said: \nThe integration regulation simply states  that public entities are to provide \n''services, programs and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate\" \nfor  a qualified person with disabilit ies.  28 C.F.R. §35.130(d). Those \nprotections would be meaningless if pl aintiffs were required to segregate \nthemselves by entering an institution before they could challenge an allegedly \ndiscriminatory law or poli cy that threatens to force them into segregated \nisolation.  Second, while it is   true that the plaintiffs in  Olmstead  were \n  16\n\ninstitutionalized at the time they brought their claim, nothing in the Olmstead \ndecision supports a conclusion that inst itutionalization is a prerequisite to \nenforcement of the ADA;s integration requirements. \n \n335 F.3d at 1181. Plaintiffs do face an increased risk of deterioration and institutionalization \ndue to the impending moves. This is more than enough to satisfy the minimal burden that \nplaintiffs carry at the preliminary injunction stage. \n  Returning to Bruggeman once again, there is another way in which the integration \nprinciple is implicated. The Seventh Circuit did not simply say that there was a right to get \nor stay out of an institution: \nThere may be an element of paradox in hte idea that a residential institution, \nsuch as an ICF/DD  . . . or . . . Community Integrated Living Arrangement . . . \nprovides a less restrictive alternative than living at home, especially when \nsome of the plaintiffs are seeking nonresidential services, enabling them to \ncontinue to live at home, though this  may be their second choice. The \nparadox  is dispelled by recognizing t hat parents, by reason of age or \nincapacity, may not be capable of taki ng good care of their adult disabled \nchildren, in which event the home env ironment may, realistically, be more \nrestrictive of the child's opportunity to develop than an institutional alternative.  \n \n324 F.3d at 911-912. This discussion is an exce llent rejoinder to the County's apparent \ntheory that it can move people  wherever it wants as long as  the types of facilities are \nroughly  equivalent. First, as already noted,  any  move increases the risk of real \ninstitutionalization. Second, and more to t he point that Judge Posner was making, the \nconcept of least restrictive environment  can include many nuances depending on what \nservices or placement will fac ilitate the \"opportunity to develop\". Social contacts were \nspecifically identified by the  Olmstead court as worthy of  protection under the ADA's \nintegration regulations. 527 U.S. at 601. Moving someone from familiar surroundings and \nestablished relationships to another placement that may appear similar on paper is in fact \nmore restrictive and would violate the integration requirements of the ADA and §504. \n  17\n\n(2)  The Department on Aging's rate  policy also violates the equal \nopportunity and enjoyment provisions of the ADA and §504. \n \n  The Department of Justice's ADA r egulations go well beyond any conventional \ntheory of discrimination that requires the comparison of a suspect class to another group. \nThey include the following prohibitions as forms of actionable discrimination: \nA public entity, in providing any aid, benef it or service, may not directly or \nthrough  contractual, licensing, or ot her  arrangements, on the basis of \ndisability -- \n \n(i)  Deny  a qualified individual wit h  a disability the opportunity to \nparticipate in or benefit from the aid, benefit or service; \n \n(ii)  Afford  a qualified individual  with  a disability an opportunity to \nparticipate in or benefit from the aid, benefit or service that is not equal to that \nafforded others; \n \n(iii)  Provide a qualified individual with a disability with an aid, benefit or \nservice that is not as e ffective in affording equal opportunity to obtain the \nsame  result, to gain the same benefi t,  or to reach the same level of \nachievement as that provided to others; \n \n(iv)  Provide different or separate aids, benefits, or services to individuals \nwith disabilities or to any class of individuals than is provided to others unless \nsuch action is necessary to provide qualified individuals with disabilities with \naids, benefits or services that are as effective as those provided to others; \n \n.          .          . \n \n(vii)  Otherwise limit a qualified individual with a disability in the enjoyment \nof any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by others receiving \nthe aid, benefit, or service. \n  \n28 C.F.R. §35.130(b)(1). The question is how to evaluate and measure the diminishment of \nthe opportunity, right, privilege, advantage, etc.   \n  The scope of these provisions wase xamined by the Second Circuit inH  enrietta D. v. \nBloomberg, 331 F.3d 261 (2d Cir. 2003), cert denied,  --- U.S. --- (March 22, 2004). The \ndefendants argued that there was no discrimination against the plaintiffs with AIDS who \n  18\n\nwere challenging the shoddy delivery of va rious social services because everyone was \nreceiving the same bad services. 331 F.3d at 277. As the Court described the issue: \nPut another way, we must determine whehter the \"concept of discrimination\" \nembraced by the ADA demands that plaintiffs identify a \"comparison class\" of \n\"similarly situated individuals given preferential treatment.\" Olmstead v. L.C., \n527 U.S. 581, 598, 119 S.Ct. 2176, 144 L.Ed. 2d 540 (1999) (plurality op.). \nWe follow our fellow circuits and the suggestions of theO  lmstead plurality in \nconcluding that it does not. \n \n331 F.3d at 273. It quoted extensively fromB  ultmeyer v. Fort Wayne Community Schools, \n100 F.3d 1281, 1283 (7th Cir. 1996), which held thatd isparate impact need not be shown in \na reasonable accommodation case.  \n  Therefore, even in the absence of any comparison class, plaintiffs will prevail under \n28 C.F.R. §35.130(b)(1) (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) & (vii). However, the plaintiffs here have identified a \ncomparison class, persons with disabilities  under the age of 60. The differential rate \ntreatment and procedural issues involved guardai ns are classic discrimination between two \ndistinct groups within the larger class of all persons with disabilities. This is also actionable \nunder the same regulations. Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 598; Henrietta D., 331 F.3d at 273. 28 \nC.F.R. §35.130(b)(1)(vii) is particularly on target.   \n \n    (3)  The Department on Aging has refused to grant or even consider a \n      reasonable accommodation to its rate policy.  \n \n  Under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, pub lic entities are required to provide \n“reasonable modifications or accommodations in their rules, policies and practices when \nnecessary to avoid discrimination.”  42 U.S.C. § 12131(2);W  CS II, slip op at 15; Innovative \nHealth Systems, 931 F.Supp. at 239. The whole accommodation process is based on the \nconcept that a rule or poli cy of general application is an obstacle to something that the \n  19\n\nclaimant wants. If that were not the case, t he claimant would actually be entitled to the \nbenefit that he or she seeks.B  y definition, granting an accommodation means stretching a \nrule of general application to benefit persons with disabilities. Bay Area Addiction Research \nv. City of Antioch, 179 F.3d 725, 732 (9th Cir. 1999), citnig The Americans with Disabilities \nAct: Title II Technical Assistance Manual §11-3.6100, illus. 1 (1993). \n  The test that has developed in housing cases under the FHA and ADA is whether \nthe accommodation is (1) reasonable and (2) necessary (3) to afford a handicapped person \nequal opportunity. WCS II, slip op. at 15; Oconomowoc Residential Programs  v. City of \nMilwaukee, 300 F.3d 775, 773 (7th Cir. 2002). The decisional process uses the McDonnell \nDouglas burden-shifting analysis whereby the plaintiff has a minimal initial burden that then \nshifts to the defense which must  show unreasonableness or undue hardship.  ORP v. \nMilwaukee, 300 F.3d at 784; see  St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks , 509 U.S. 502, 515 \n(1993) (\"what is required to establish the McDonnell Douglas prima facie case is infinitely \nless than what a directed verdict demands.\"). Similarly, the Court in Henrietta D. said the \nplaintiff's initial burden is \"not a heavy one.\" 331 F.3d at 280, quoting Borkowski v. Valley \nCent. Sch. Dist., 63 F.3d 131, 138 (2nd Cir. 1995). And as  this Court recently held, the \nequal opportunity element makes little sense outside of the housing realm.W  CS II, slip op. \nat 15-16. Therefore, plaintiffs need only show some likelihood of success on the issues of \nreasonableness and necessity. \n  DOA's policy (or practice or whatever) ofn ever granting a provider rate increase and \nmaintaining lower rates than DSD is exactly the kind of rule of general application that is \nsubject to the accommodation requirement. Persons living in CBRFs operated by providers \nwho  give more intensive and higher cost se rvices  are particularly in need of this \n  20\n\naccommodation, however, if DOA rates are signfiicantly below DSD rates anywhere in the \nsystem there will be contract terminations and moves to the detriment of the clients. Some \nprocess of targeted rate increases, even if  not system-wide, could ameliorate the worst \nsituations. Simply standing on the rate policy  as DOA is doing is a blanket denial of a \nreasonable accommodation which is actionable in its own right.  Wisconsin Correctional \nService v. City of Milwaukee, 173 F.Supp.2d 842, 853 (E.D. Wis. 2001) (\"WCS I\"), citing cf. \nPGA Tour, Inc. v. Martin, 532 U.S. 661 (2001).    \nPlaintiffs are not suggesting that the C ourt can or should engage in the entire \nbalancing test at this point. First there should be discovery on rates, client moves and the \nevaluation methodology that drives the placement process. It is sufficient for the purpose of \nthe initial preliminary injunction that plaintiffs have a reasonable likelihood of prevailing on \nthe accommodation claim regarding the rate issue and that is certainly the case.3  \nC.  Plaintiffs do not have an adequate remedy at law and will suffer  \n   irreparable  harm. \n \nPlaintiffs must ordinarily show that a lack of an adequate remedy at law will lead to \nirreparable harm if preliminary relief is denied.  Abbott Laboratories, 971 F.2d at 11.  “The \nquestion is whether the Plainti ff will be made whole if he prevails on the merits and is \nawarded damages.”  Miller v. LeSea Broadcasting, Inc., 896 F. Supp. 889, 894 (E.D. Wis. \n1995), quoting Roland Machinery Co. v. Dresser Industries, Inc. ,749 F.2d 380, 386 (7th Cir. \n1984).  It is enough that the movant show a po ssibility of irreparable injury. An actual \nlikelihood is not required.  FSLIC v. Sahni, 868 F.2d 1096, 1097 (9th Cir. 1989). Violations of \n                                            \n3 \nPlaintiffs are not suggesting that there is a potential accommodation that will fix the differential \ntreatment of guardians by DOA. That policy is pure discrimination. It is to be hoped that granting \naccommodations to the rate policy will eliminate the  funding disputes that lead to conflict with \nguardians of persons 60 and over. \n  21\n\nthe ADA and §504 are within a special category of cases where proof on liability, without \nany proof of irreparable  harm, is sufficient to grant an injunction. See  Wisconsin v. \nStockbridge-Munsee Community, 67 F.Supp.2d 990, 995 (E.D. Wis. 1999) (statutory \ninjunction denied under Indian  Gaming Act); see also  Baxter v. City of Belleville , 720 \nF.Supp. 720, 734 (S.D. Ill. 1989) (statutory injunction issued under FHA). A more recent \ncase, brought under the ADA and FHA, held that t he reference to injunctive relief in the \nFHA was sufficient to invoke the exception.  United States v. Edward Rose & Sons, 246 \nF.Supp.2d 744, 754 (E.D. Mich. 2003). The result should be the same under the ADA given \nthe comparable availability of injunctive relief and the \"national mandate\" language in 42 \nU.S.C. §12101(b)(1). \nClearly damages are inadequate to compensate the plaintiffs here so they can show \nirreparable harm in any event. Their loss of friends, familiar surroundings and established \nprograms that are working well cannot be  compensated by money. The harm will be \nimmediate as soon as they are moved. Also, since they must be below a certain income \nand asset level to be eligible for Family  Care, receiving a sum of money would be \nproblematic in and of itself. All of these fact ors satisfy this element  of the preliminary \ninjunction equation.  \nD.  Milwaukee County will not suffer  any harm from the granting of a \npreliminary injunction. \n \nAfter the threshold factors are met, the first of the two balancing considerations is \nthe potential harm to the party opposing the motion.  Abbott Laboratories, 971 F.2d at 11-\n12.  The process used is a “sliding scale,” thatis , the greater the likelihood that Plaintiff will \nsucceed on the merits, the less of a showing plani tiff must make on the remaining factors.  \n  22\n\nDiginet, Inc. v. Western Union ATS, Inc. ,958 F.2d 1388, 1393 (7th Cir. 1992);S torck USA, \nL.P. v. Farley Candy Co., 14 F.3d 311, 314, (7th Cir. 1994).  Further, it “is an acceptable \nequitable principle that a court does not have to balance the equities in a case where the \ndefendant’s conduct has been willful.”  Wisconsin v. Stockbridge-Munsee Community, 67 \nF.Supp.2d at 1020,  citing EPA v. Environmental Waste Control, 917 F.2d 327 (7th Cir. \n1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 975 (1991). \nGiven the willful nature of its conduct,  the County does not have any basis for \nobjecting to the entry of an injunction on this ground, but it will not suffer harm at any rate. \nHIL has been and remains willing to serve the affe cted individuals at the existing rate. It \nthought there was such an agreem ent until the County reversed itself. With an interim \nagreement, the County will be no worse off than if this entire dispute had never happened. \nThis factor does not prevent and actually calls for the entry of a preliminary injunction. \n  23\n\nE.  The public interest calls for the entry of a preliminary injunction. \n   The second balancing consideration is what  effect the preliminary injunction will \nhave on the public interest.   Abbott Laboratories, 971 F.2d at 11-12.   Once again, the \nprocess used is a “sliding scale,” that is, theg reater the likelihood that Plaintiff will succeed \non the merits, the less of a showing Plaintiff must make on the remaining factors.  Diginit, \nInc. v. Western Union ATS, Inc., 958 F.2d 1388, 1393 (7th Cir. 1992). The courts recognize \nthat the public interest may be harmed eit her by granting or  denying a preliminary \ninjunction.    Ping  v. National Educ. Ass’ n, 870 F.2d 1369, 1371-72 (7th Cir. 1989).   \nHowever, even probable harm to the public inte rest does not prevent the granting of a \npreliminary injunction in appropriate cases.  Abbott Laboratories, 971 F.2d at 12, n. 3. \n    Effective care and treatment in the least restrictive setting for persons with disabilities is \none of the preeminent public policies of the State of Wisconsin. Wis. Stat., §§51.001 and \n55.001. The issues in this case are of vitailm  portance to the citizens of Milwaukee County, \nincluding those with and without dis abilities. Issuing a preliminary injunction so that the \nparties and the Court can deal with the merits in a deliberate and rational way is clearly in \nthe public interest.     \nIII.  AN EXPEDITED DISCOVERY AND BRIEFING SCHEDULE IS NECESSARY IN \nORDER TO RESOLVE THE QUESTION OF CLASS CERTIFICATION AND THE \nULTIMATE MERITS OF THE CASE. \n \n  Plaintiffs are also requesting that  the Court conduct an expedited scheduling \nconference in this case. Federal courts have wide discretion to schedule the proceedings \nbefore them. The court may initiate a schedu ling conference or one of the parties may \nmake such a request by motion.D  iDomenico v. New York Life Insurance Co,. 837 F.Supp. \n1203, 1206 (M.D. Fla. 1993). There is also specific authority for an expedited hearing in \n  24\n\ndeclaratory judgment cases. \"The court ma y order a speedy heari ng of an action for a \ndeclaratory judgment and may advance it on thec alendar.\" Rule 57, Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure; Temp-Resisto Corp. v. Glatt, 18 F.R.D. 148, 152 (D.N.J. 1955). The Rules also \nprovide for expedited consideration of a motionf or preliminary injunction, and provides for \nthe trial on the merits \"to be advanced and conoslidated with the hearing on the appilcation \n[for preliminary injunction].\" Rule 65, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. As one court held: \nExigencies of time have been consistently recognized as a sufficient basis for \naccelerating the procedural calendar of cases in which injunctive relief, as \nopposed to declaratory relief is sought. See, e.g., Studebaker Corp. v. Gittlin, \n360 F.2d 692 (2d Cir. 1966). See also 5 Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and \nProcedure §1346 (1969). \n \nDrinan v. Nixon, 364 F.Supp. 853 (D.Mass. 1973). \n  The urgency for the plaintiffs and the putative class that they seek to represent is \nobvious. More and more persons under 60 w ho receive Milwaukee County disability \nservices will reach their 60th birthday every  month and the financial issues which have \nalready become acute for one provider will  ripple throughout the system. The level of \ndisruption for both the clients and the County will snowball if this matter does not move \nforward with the assistance of an expedited scheduling order. \nCONCLUSION \n  The conditions for amending the complain t to add two plaintiffs have been met. \nPlaintiffs have met each of the  criteria for granting a prelim inary injunction in order to \npreserve  the status quo. It is also appr opriate  to conduct an expedited scheduling \nconference. \n \nDated: April 9, 2004 \n  25\n\n \n     Respectfully  submitted, \n       \n     ROBERT  THEINE PLEDL \n       Attorney  for the Plaintiffs \n \n       s/  Robert Theine Pledl \n       _________________________________ \n       State  Bar No. 1007710 \n       1110  N.

One aspect of this issue r elates to the \nplaintiffs' claims under the inte gration provisions of the Am ericans with Disabilities Act and \n§504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Plaintiffs have alleged that the State and County policies at issue \nexpose them to an imminent threat of institutionalization. See Fisher v. Oklahoma Health Care \nAuthority, 335 F.3d 1175, 1185 (10th Cir. 2003) (case allowed to proceed based on showing that \n\"[s]ome  will  eventually end up in a nu rsing  home.\").  Plaintiffs' earlier argum ents  and \nsubmissions, along with the John Villegas-Grubbs affidavit, are sufficient to address this issue. \n  The other aspect of the plaintiffs' right to  remain in their current homes is som ewhat \ndifferent.  They are claim ing  harm  even if th e  anticipated forced  moves  do not lead to \ninstitutionalization. In support of this theory, th e plaintiffs have alleged that the choice of a  \nparticular group home is based on a number of factors including the characteristics of the home \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 84     Filed 09/09/2005     Page 2 of 10 \nitself as well as its proximity to various features in the surrounding community of interest to the \nparticular resident. [4th Am d. Cmplt. ¶¶20-21].  Each of the nam ed plaintiffs selected their \ncurrent residence for a reason and they wish to remain in their chosen home. The plaintiffs have \nalso alleged that \"many individuals with disabilities develop attachments to the other clients and \nto particular staff members.\" [¶22]. Each of the plaintiffs alleges that it \"would be very traumatic \nand harmful\" to be \"forcibly removed\" from their homes. [¶¶78, 89, 99, 108, 118, 126].  \n  The affidavits show that plaintiffs will be  able to introduce eviden ce in support of their \nclaim that lateral moves to other group homes will be harmful. [Miller ¶9: \"[Joan Bzdawka] has \nfriendships with other clients and with staff. I would like her to continue residing at Arbor House \nand attending the Paragon day program.\"]; [Burr I ¶¶9-14, 34: \"We believe that it would also be \ntraumatic for Gerald, Joan B., Marilyn B., Sandra E. and the HIL resid ents who will be turning \n60 in the near future if they were forced to leave their homes and day programs.\"]; [Burr II ¶21: \n\"Any person with a developmental disability is at a greater risk of deterioration whenever their \nresidence or other program changes.\"]; [Kallas ¶¶7-8, 10-11: \"There is also a one-third increase \nin mortality each time elderly residents are relocated to a new facility. \"]; [Cook ¶¶50-51: \"The \npotential for real harm exists when a person wi th extensive support needs transfers to another \ncommunity-based facility without the history that has been developed by the facility they left.\"]. \n  The defendants argue that lateral movements between group homes are not actionable:   \nPlaintiffs have failed to c ite any authority for the proposition that this Court has \nthe authority under the ADA, the Rehab ilitation Act or the Medical Assistance \n(\"MA\")  statutes  to r equire  that  plaintiffs  remain in   a p articular  or  specific \ncommunity placement, if, as plaintiffs' residential providers threaten here, those \nproviders no longer participate in the Family Care program. (State Brf. at 8). \n \n.  . . all that can be discerned from   the  allegations  of  the  Fourth A mended \nComplaint with regard to impact of defendants' alleged disparate treatment of the \nplaintiffs is that it m ight result in a move from one community placem ent to \nanother . . .  (County Brf. at 5-6). \n  2\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 84     Filed 09/09/2005     Page 3 of 10 \n.  . . plaintiffs are threat ened  with nothing  more  than a move to a different \ncommunity placement. (State Brf. at 9).  \n \nThe defendants are correct that there is no case law directly on point under the ADA, §504 or the \nMA statutes regarding this issue, however, this  does not m ean that plaintiffs have no legally \nprotected interest in remaining in their current homes. The following will show that they have a \nlegitimate legal right to remain in their homes and have standing to assert that right. \nARGUMENT \nI.  Group home residents have a legally pro tected interest in continuing to live in a \n  particular home of their choice. \n  \n  The defendants as moving parties bear the burden of proving that \"no legally cognizable \nclaim for relief exists.\" 5B Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure, Civil 3d §1357, at \n462 (2004). In analyzing a motion under Rule 12(b)(6), \"[t]he district court should be especially \nreluctant to dismiss on the basis of the pleading when the asserted theory of liability is novel or \neven 'extreme,' since it is important that new legal theories be explored and assayed in the light \nof actual facts rather than a pleader's suppositions.\" Wright & Miller, supra. at 692. The same \nprinciple applies to motions for judgment on the pleadings. 5C Wright & Miller, supra. at 222. \n  In Reed v. Monahan's Landscape Co., 2004 WL 422686, No. 03 C 7081 (N.D. Ill. March \n4, 2004), Judge Zagel found only one case from anot her circuit that peripherally addressed the \nissue raised by a motion to dismiss. Rather than decide the issue on that  basis, the motion was  \ndenied so that it could be appe aled later \"on a fully developed  factual record.\" *3. In the sam e \nvein, the First Circuit reversed a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal in a novel voting rights case because:  \nAs courts get more experience dealing with these cases and the rules firm  up, it \nmay be more feasible to dismiss weaker cases on the pleadings, but in the cas e \nbefore us we think that the plaintiffs  are entitled to an opportunity to develop \nevidence before the merits are resolved. \n \nMetts v. Murphy, 363 F.3d 8, *11 (1st Cir. 2004) (en banc). \n  3\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 84     Filed 09/09/2005     Page 4 of 10 \n  In order to support a novel clai m, \"[t]he plaintiff has to sh ow that while her legal claim \nhas no basis in existing law, or at least the law's current pigeonholes, it lies in the natural line of \nthe  law's  development  and should now be recognized as part of the law.\"  Kirksey  v. R.J. \nReynolds Tobacco Co., 168 F.3d 1039, 1042 (7th Cir. 1999) (emphasis in original). There are no \ncases specifically dealing with the right to live in a particular  group home and the Court m ust \nlook elsewhere to determine whether plaintiffs have a legitimate interest that is recognized under \nfederal law. See J.H. ex rel. Higgins v. Johnson , 346 F.3d 788, 793 (7th Cir. 2003) (state law \nmay not create causes of action under §1983).                               \n  Various cases have noted the unique role th at group homes play in the lives of persons \nwith disabilities. See Oconomowoc Residential Programs, Inc. v. City of Milwaukee , 300 F.3d \n775, 787 (7th Cir. 2002) (\"group living arrangem ents can be essential for disabled persons who \ncannot live without the services such arrangem ents provide, and not sim ilarly essential for the \nnon-disabled.\"); Brandt v. Village of Chebanse , 82 F.3d 172, 174 (7th Ci r. 1996) (\"joint living \narrangements are essential\"); Erdman v. City of Fort Atkinson, 84 F.3d 960, 963 (7th Cir. 1996) \n(\"[l]iving together in groups of  that size is claimed to be therapeutic and is also the only way \nmost of the residents can live in a single-family home.\"); Oconomowoc Residential Programs, \nInc. v. City of Greenfield , 23 F.Supp.2d 941, 958 (E.D. W is. 1998) (\"[t]he developmentally \ndisabled people ORP serves are  not able to live independently,  so the CBRF is one m ode of \nameliorating their inability to live independently by enabling them to live in small groups with \nnonresidential caretakers.\"); Smith & Lee Associates, Inc.  v. City of Taylor, Michigan , 13 F.3d \n920, 931 (6th Cir. 1993) (\"the handicapped m ay have little choice but to live in a comm ercial \nhome if they desire to live  in a residential neighbor hood.\"). The strong feelings that residents \nmay have about their group hom e are illustrated by  the plight of Valerie D., a putative class \n  4\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 84     Filed 09/09/2005     Page 5 of 10 \nmember that lives in an  HIL home. [Burr-II ¶13].  She was one of the individu al plaintiffs in \nOconomowoc Residential v. Milwaukee. After a lengthy legal battle to live in her current home, \nher continued residence is now threatened due to funding because she turned 60 in 2004. Id. \n  There is no question that persons  with disabilities have a vital, legally protected interest \nin living in a group home. The disputed issue is wh ether they have a right to a particular group \nhome. The Erdman case discussed this concept: \nIn our case, the district court concluded that what the  plaintiffs must show is \ninequality  of opportunity to live in the  city  of Fort At kinson.  We  express \nskepticism about that interpretation of  a statute [the Fair Housing Act] which \nrefers specifically to inequality of opportunity to live in a  dwelling . . . But for  \nreasons which we now explain, we need not  answer the question as to whether a \ncity's providing handicapped housing somewhere within its borders is sufficient to \nsatisfy the [FHA]. \n \n84 F.3d at 963 (emphasis in original). There is no principled reason to distinguish state and local \nzoning policies that restrict access to particular dwellings in violation of the FHA from state and \nlocal funding policies that restrict access to pa rticular dwellings in violation of the ADA, §504  \nand the Medicaid statutes. This passage supports the plaintiffs' position that there is a federally  \nrecognized right to live in a par ticular group home as opposed to  just a similar type of group \nhome \"somewhere.\" The reasoning in Erdman is persuasive even if it is dicta.  \n  The plaintiffs are not seeking to rem ain in their current homes simply because they like \nthe physical attributes or ambiance of a particular structure.1 They have alleged that group home \nresidents form attachments within the home and at their day programs and that each of the named \nplaintiffs will be harmed by the loss of these va rious relationships. [4th Amd. Cmplt. ¶¶22, 78, \n89, 99, 108, 118, 126]. It is the im pending termination of these significant relationships that \nimplicates additional legal rights that have been recognized in other contexts.    \n                                                 \n1 Plaintiffs are not conceding that liking a particular group home, standing alone, is an insufficient basis to support a \nclaim. Persons under 60 and residents of other counties can choose to remain in their current group home for any \nreason whatsoever. The point is that the plaintiffs have also alleged additional factors which certainly state a claim.   \n  5\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 84     Filed 09/09/2005     Page 6 of 10 \n  Plaintiffs had elected not to pursue any substantive constitutional claims in this case since \nthey would be subject to rationa l basis review rather than the heightened requirements of the \nfederal disability statutes. Oconomowoc Residential v. Greenfield, 23 F.Sup.2d at 953. However, \nif  a particular relationship is entitled to c onstitutional  protection, it should receive sim ilar \nrecognition under the federal laws that have declar ed persons with disabilities to be a protected \nclass entitled to special legal status. Id.; 42 U.S.C. §12101; 29 U.S.C. §701(a); see Tennessee v. \nLane, 541 U.S. 509, 516 (2004) (discussing 42 U.S.C.  §12101(b)(1) & (b)(4). T his \"lies in the \nnatural line of the law's development\" pursuant to Kirksey, 168 F.3d at 1042.   \n  The United States Suprem e Court recognized  the expansive nature  of the concept of \n\"family\"  in  Moore  v. City of Eas t  Cleveland,  431 U.S. 494 (1977). Overturning a zoning \nordinance that prohibited more distant family members from living with each other, the plurality \nobserved that relatives beyond the sc ope of the nuclear fam ily have historically chosen to live \ntogether \"[e]specially in times of adversity, such as the death of a spouse or economic need.\" Id. \nThe principal reason that people live in group homes is that they require care beyond that which \nmost families can provide. Oconomowoc Residential v. Milwaukee, 300 F.3d at 787 (group home \nresidents \"require a living situation where supportive services are available twenty-four hours per \nday.\") Their only opportunity for a semblance of family life is in a group home. \n  It is not necessary that group home residents be determined to actually constitute a family \nin order to have a legally protected interest in the continuation of their  relationships within the \nhome. The Supreme Court \"has recognized that th e freedom to enter into and carry on certain \nintimate or private relationships is a funda mental element of liberty pr otected by the Bill of \nRights.\" Bd. of Dir. of Rotary International v. Rotary Club of Duarte, 481 U.S. 537, 545 (1987). \nThis is not limited to family relationships. Id.; Marcum v. McWhorter, 308 F.3d 635, 640 (6th \n  6\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 84     Filed 09/09/2005     Page 7 of 10 \nCir. 2002). The liberty interest extends to other  relationships that \"are distinguished by such \nattributes as relative smallness, a high degree of selectivity in decisions to begin or maintain the \naffiliation, and seclusion from others in crucial aspects of the relationship.\" Roberts v. United \nStates Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 620 (1984). The relevant fact ors in determining whether certain \nrelationships are entitled to constitutional protection are \"size, purpose, policies, selectivity, \ncongeniality, and other characteristics that in a particular case may be pertinent.\" Id. Neither the \nJaycees nor the Rotary  Club could m eet the standard because they ad mitted virtually anyone \n(except women, which was the point of the litigation) and often  invited the public to meetings. \nRoberts, 468 U.S. at 621;  Bd. of Dir. of Rotary International , 481 U.S. at 546-7. There was a \ncontinuous \"flow of prospects\" to replenish the membership because of high turnover. Id.    \n  This  Court's task is to determ ine  \"where [ a  particular]  relationship's  objective \ncharacteristics locate it on the spectrum from the most intimate to the most attenuated of personal \nrelationships.\" Id., 468 U.S. at 620. The reasons that  the Supreme Court gave for denying \nprotection to the Jaycees and the Rotary  are precisely w hy group home residents do have a \nprotected interest.  \n  First, group homes are small. HIL's homes in Milwaukee County  serve 4-6 residents. \n[Burr-II ¶10]. SRCA's homes each serve 20 residents. [Kallas ¶4].  \n  Second, considering purpose, policies and sel ectivity together, there is a painstaking \nadmission process, [Burr ¶8-10]; [Kallas ¶9], in order to assemble a group of residents who are \nable to live together in a \"family\" atmosphere. [Kallas ¶11]. The complaint alleges: \n(21)  A great deal of care g oes into choosing a residential facility or a day \nprogram.  Individuals may be referred  to  a particular provider by a county \ncaseworker based on the genera l characteristics of the person and the facility or \nprogram,  but that would only be th e  beginning of the process. Many \nindividuals/guardians/agents choose a facility or program based on its proximity \nto family, friends, recreational activities, church and a variety of other community \n  7\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 84     Filed 09/09/2005     Page 8 of 10 \nactivities. Provider staff, the guardian/agent and the individual himself or herself \nalso try to determine in advance whether the client will get along well with both \nstaff and other residents and participants  in terms of personalities and similar \ninterests. The inability of certain residents to get along with each other is likely to \nlead to another move. That is the reason that so much attention is paid to choosing \ncompatible residents, participants and staff. Certain individuals also have special \nor unusual service needs that could require  a specialized service provider. All of \nthese factors could affect the choice of a particular facility or program. \n.   .   . \n(25)  Given  the com plexity  of locating and arranging suitable services, \nobtaining the approval of th e person and/or guardian /agent, getting through the \ninitial period of adjustment and the de velopment of relationships by the client, \nthere is a general preference among families, guardians, agents, service providers, \ncounty  agencies and the clients them selves  for rem aining  in a particular \nresidential setting and day program. \n \n[4th Amd. Cmplt.]. Many components of the admission process are actually prescribed by law. \nHFS §83.32 (CBRF) and §88.06 (AFH), Wis. Adm. Code.    \n  Third, in regard to \"congeni ality\", plaintiffs have alleged that group hom e residents \ndevelop important attachments to staff and other clients. [4th  Amd. Cmplt. ¶22]; [Burr ¶12]; \n[Kallas ¶10]. \"The whole purpose is  to develop a sense of living  together and working together \nas a family.\" [Burr ¶12]. \n  There are other factors as well. These are private homes that are not open to the public so \nthey clearly meet the seclusion test. Roberts, 468 U.S. 609 at 620. And, any relationship that  \ninvolves sharing a kitchen, living room or bathroom is clearly at the intimate end of the Supreme \nCourt's spectrum. Bd. of Dir. of Rotary International, 481 U.S. at 546-7                      \n  The bottom line is that group home residents associate in ways that closely resemble the \nfamily relationships that have historically b een granted Constitutional protection. They live in \ngroup homes because they cannot live in conventional fa mily groups because of their need for \ndisability services. If plaintiffs happened to be a few years younger or if they lived in a different \nWisconsin county, they would be able to choose  their homes and their housemates without the \n  8\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 84     Filed 09/09/2005     Page 9 of 10 \nconstraints that result from  the government actions at issue in this litigation. Plaintiffs have \nalleged that it violates the letter and spirit of the federal disability laws to treat the plaintiffs and \nthe  putative  class d ifferently  from  these o thers  who are   similarly  situated  except  for  the \nhappenstance that places them in a different funding program. The relationships that group home \nresidents have with each other  and with staff clearly meet the standard for a pro tected liberty \ninterest and, therefore, also provid e a legitimate foundation for the relief that plaintiffs seek \nunder the ADA, §504 and the Medicaid statutes.  \nII.  Plaintiffs have standing based on a subs tantial likelihood that they will be forced \nfrom their current g roup homes based on  the financial condition of residential \nproviders in Milwaukee County.  \n \n  Plaintiffs have sought leave to file the expert report of John Villegas-Grubbs to show that \nthey will be able to introduce evidence in support of the allegations that the Family Care funding \nscheme has a negative impact on Milwaukee County  residential providers that will lead to the \ninvoluntary relocation of the indi vidual plaintiffs and other Fam ily Care clients. [4th Am d. \nCmplt. ¶¶34, 59-64]. The JVG report is in addition to the Cook affidavit. [¶¶27-34, 49].  \n  The  defendants object to any consideration  of  the affidavits and factual m aterials \nsubmitted  by  the plaintiffs. However, the Se venth  Circuit is   known for its   acceptance of \nadditional factual submissions by plaintiffs in response to Rule 12(b)(6) motions. 5B W right & \nMiller, supra., at 777, citing  Smith v. Boyle, 144 F.3d 1060 (7th Cir. 1998) (other citations \nomitted). The recent case of Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians v. \nNorton,  --- F.3d ---, 2005 W L  2100530, *6 (7th Cir.  September  1, 2005), reaffirm ed  that \nadditional facts may be submitted throughout the proceedings and even on appeal in response to \na dismissal motion. It also restated the liberal pr inciples of standing in cases based on probable \nharm consistent with the discussion in the plaintiffs' original brief. Id. at *6. \n  9\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00193-LA     Document 84     Filed 09/09/2005     Page 10 of 10 \n  The substantial likelihood that the individual plaintiffs, as well as the putative class \nmembers, will suffer imminent harm from the actions of the defendants is more than sufficient to \nprovide standing to proceed on the claims in the fourth amended complaint.  \nCONCLUSION \n  The defense has failed to carry its burden of showing that the plaintiffs' claims are legally \ninsubstantial or that they ca nnot prove any set of facts in  support  of those claim s.  All of \nplaintiffs' legal claims in the fourth amended complaint should be permitted to go forward.  \n  Date:  September 9, 2005 \n     Respectf ully submitted, \n       \n     ROBE RT THEINE PLEDL \n       Attorney  for the Plaintiffs \n     \n           /s/  _Robert Theine Pledl____________________ \n       State  Bar No. 1007710 \n       1110  N.
